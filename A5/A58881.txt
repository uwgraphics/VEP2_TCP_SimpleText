TO THE HIGH AND EXCELLENT LADY MARY, Duchess of RICHMOND and LENNOX.
Madam,
MY Author, having in this his Work represented a Lady, transcendent in all
perfections, both of body and mind, in the person of his incomparable
Isabella, selected out of all the choicest beauties of France, the great and
virtuous Duchess of Rohan, as her nearest parrallel, to dedicate it unto. In
imitation of whom I have presumed, from amongst the most accomplished Ladies of
England, to make choice of your Grace to present this Illustrious Princess of
Monaco unto, as the true picture of your self, wherein you may behold lively
pourtrai'd forth all the many rare, and excellent graces and virtues, wherewith
Heaven has so happily beautified you. Be pleased then, great Duchess, to
accept thereof, not according to the unworthiness of the presenter, but
according to the merit of the present, which exhibites to the view of the
world, besides many other remarkable passages, all that is most eminently
desirable in that Sex, whereof your Grace being one of the chief, will no
doubt, out of that innated goodness, and sweetness of disposition, which is
naturally incident thereunto, vouchsafe graciously to receive this mean, but
hearty offering of

Madam Your Graces most humbly devoted servant Henry Cogan.

THE PREFACE.
I Do not know what kind of praise the Ancients thought they gave to that
Painter, who not able to end his work, finished it accidently by throwing his
pencill against his Picture; but I know very well, that it should not have
obliged (...), and that I should have taken it rather for a Satyr, than an
Elogium. The operations of the spirit are too important to be left to the
conduct of chance, and I had rather be accused for failing out of knowledge,
than for doing well without minding it. There is nothing which temeritie does
not undertake, and which fortune does not bring to pass; but when a man relyes
on those two guides, if he does not err, he may err; and of this sort; even
when the events are successful no glory is merited thereby. Every art has its
certain rules, which by infallible means lead to the ends proposed; and
provided that an Architect takes his measures right, he is assured of the
beauty of his building. Believe not for all this, Reader, that I will conclude
from thence my work is complete, because I have followed the rules which may
render it so: I know that it is of this labor, as of the Mathematical
Sciences, where the opperation may fail, but the art does never fail; nor do I
make this discourse but to show you, that if I have left some faults in my
Book, they are the effects of my weakeness, and not of my negligence. Suffer
me then to discover unto you all the resorts of this frame, and let you see,
if not all that I have done, at leastwise all that I have indevored to do.

Whereas we cannot be knowing but of that which others do teach us, and that it
is for him that comes after, to follow them who preced him, I have believed,
that for the laying the ground-plot of this work, we are to consult with the
Grecians, who have been our first Masters, pursue the course which they have
held, and labor in imitating them to arrive at the same end, which those great
men propounded to themselves. I have seen in those famous Romanzes of
antiquity, that in imitation of the Epique Poem there is a principal action
whereunto all the rest, which reign over all the work, are fastened, and which
makes them that they are not employed, but for the conducting of it to its
perfection. The action in Homers Iliades is the destruction of Troy; in his
Odysseas the return of Ulysses to Ithaca; in Uirgill the death of Turnus, or to
say better, the conquest of Italy; nearer to our times, in Tasso the taking of
Jerusalem: and to pass from the Poem to the Romanze, which is my principal
object, in Heliodorus the marriage of Theagines and Carielia. It is not because
the Episodes in the one, and the several Histories in the other, are not
rather beauties, than defects; but it is always necessary, that the adress of
him which imployes them should hold them in some sort to this principal
action, to the end, that by this ingenious concatenation, all the parts of them
should make but one body, and that nothing may be seen in them which is loose
and unprofitable. Thus the marriage of my Justiniano and his Isabella, being the
object which I have proposed unto my self, I have employed all my care so to
do, that all the parts of my work may tend to that conclusion; that there may
be a strong connection between them; and that, except the obstacle which fortune
opposes to the desires of my Heroes, all things may advance, or at lestwise
endeavor to advance his marriage, which is the end of my labor. Now those great
Geniusses of antiquity, from who^ I borrow my light, knowing that well-ordering
is one of the principal parts of a piece, have given so excellent a one to
their speaking pictures, that it would be as much stupididitie, as pride, not
to imitate them. They have not done like those Painters, who present in one and
the same cloth a Prince in the Cradle, upon the Throne, and in the Tomb,
perplexing, by this so little judicious a confusion, him, that considers their
work; but with an incomparable adress they begin their History in the middle,
so to give some suspense to the Reader, even from the first opening of the
book; and to confine themselves within reasonable bounds they have made the
History (as I likewise have done after them) not to last above a year, the rest
being delivered by narration. Thus all things being ingeniously placed, and of
a just greatness, no doubt but pleasure will redound from thence to him that
beholds them, and glory to him that has done them. But amongst all the rules
which are to be observed in the composition of these works, that of true
resemblance is without question the most necessary; it is, as it were, the
fundamental stone of this building, and but upon which it cannot subsist;
without it nothing can move, without it nothing can please: and if this
charming deceiver does not beguile the mind in Romanzes, this kind of reading
disgusts, in stead of intertaining it: I have labored then never to eloigue my
self from it, and to that purpose I have observed the manners, customs,
Religions, and inclinations of people: And to give a more true resemblance to
things, I have made the foundations of my work Historical, my principal
personages such as are marked out in the true History for illustrious persons,
and the wars effective. This is the way doubtless, whereby one may arrive at
his end; for when as falsehood and truth are confounded by a dextrus hand, wit
has much ado to disintangle them, and is not easily carried to destroy that
which pleases it; contrarily, when as invention does not make use of this
artifice, and that falsehood is produced openly, this gross untruth makes no
impression in the soul, nor gives any delight: As indeed how should I be
touched with the misfortunes of the Queen of Gundaya, and of the King of
Astrobacia, when as I know their very Kingdoms are not in the Universal Mapp,
or, to say better, in the being of things? But this is not the only defect
which may carry us from true resemblance, for we have at other times seen
Romanzes, which set before us monsters, in thinking to let us see Miracles;
their Authors by adhering too much to wonders have made Grotesques, which have
not a little of the visions of a burning Fever; and one might demand of these
Messieurs with more reason, than the Duke of Ferrara did of Ariosto, after he
had read his Olando, Messer Lodovico done diavolo havete pigliato tante
coyonerie? As for me, I hold, that the more natural adventures are, the more
satisfaction they give; and the ordinary course of the Sun seems more
mervailous to me, than the strange and deadly rays of Comets; for which reason
it is also that I have not caused so many Shipwracks, as there are in some
ancient Romanzes; and to speak seriously Du Bartas might say of these Authors,
That with their word they bind,
Or loose, at will, the blowing of the wind.


So as one might think that Aeolus has given them the Winds ^nclosed in a
bagg, as he gave them to Ulysses, so patly do they unchain them; they make
tempests and shipwracks when they please, they raise them on the Pacifique Sea,
they find rocks and shelves where the most expert Pilots have never observed
any: But they which dispose thus of the winds, know not, how the Prophet does
assure us, that God keeps them in his Treasures; and that Philosophy, as clear
sighted as it is, could never discover their retreat. Howbeit I pretend not
hereby to banish Shipwracks from Romanzes, I approve of them in the works of
others, and make use of them in mine; I know likewise, that the Sea is the
Scene most proper to make great changes in, and that some have named it the
Theater of inconstancy; but as all excess is vicious, I have made use of it
but moderately, for to conserve true resembling: Now the same design is the
cause also, that my Heroes is not oppressed with such a prodigious quantity of
accidents, as arrive unto some others, for that according to my sense, the same
is far from true resemblance, the life of no man having ever been so crossed. It
would be better in my oppinion to separate the adventures, to form diverse
Histories of them, and to make persons acting, thereby to appear both fertile,
and judicious together, and to be still within this so necessary true
resemblance. And indeed they who have made one man alone defeat whole Armies,
have forgotten the Proverb which says, not one against two; and know not that
antiquity does assure us, how Hercules would in that case be too weak. It is
without all doubt, that to represent a true heroical courage, one should make
it execute some thing extraordinary, as it were by a transport of the Heroes;
but he must not continue in that sort, for so those incredible actions would
degenerate into ridiculous fables, and never move the mind. This fault is the
cause also of committing another; for they which do nothing but heap adventure
upon adventure, without ornament, and without stirring up passions by the
artifices of Rhetorique, are irksome, in thinking to be the more intertayning.
This dry narration, and without a^i, has more of an old Chronicle, than of a
Romanze, which may very well be imbelished with those ornaments, since History,
as severe and scrupulous as it is, does not forbear employing them. Certain
Authors, after they have described an adventure, a daring design, or some
surprising event, able to possess one with the bravest apprehensions in the
world, are contented to assure us, that such a Heroes thought of very gallant
things, without telling us what they are; and this is that alone which I desire
to know: For how can I tell, whether in these events fortune has not done as
much as he? whether his valor be not a brutish valor? and whether he has born
the misfortunes that arrived unto him, as a worthy man should do? it is not by
things without him, it is not by the caprichioes of destiny, that I will judge
of him; it is by the motions of his soul, and by that which he speaks. I
honor all them that write at this day; I know their persons, their works,
their merits; but as canonizing is for none but the dead, they will not take it
ill if I do not deifie them, since they are living. And in this occasion I
propose no other example, than the great and incomparable Urfe; certainly it
must be acknowledged that he has merited his reputation; that the love which
all the earth bears him is just; and that so many different Nations, which
have translated his Book into their tongues, had reason to do it: as for me, I
confess openly, that I am his adorer; these twenty years I have loved him; he
is indeed admirable over all; he is fertile in his inventions, and in
inventious reasonable; every thing in him is mervailous, every thing in him is
excellent; and that which is more important, every thing in him is natural,
and truly resembling: But amongst many rare matters, that which I most esteem
of is, that he knows how to touch the passions so delicately, that he may be
called the Painter of the soul; he goes searching out in the bottom of hearts
the most secret thoughes; and in the diversity of natures, which he represents,
every one finds his own pourtrait, so that If amongst mortals any be
That merits Altars, Vrfe's he
Who can alone pretend thereto.


Certainly there is nothing more important in this kind of composition, than
strongly to imprint the Idea, or (to say better) the image of the Heroes in the
mind of the Reader, but in such sort, as if they were known to them; for that
it is which interesseth him in their adventures, and from thence his delight
comes; now to make them be known perfectly, it is not sufficient to say how
many times they have suffered shipwreck, and how times they have incountred
robbers, but their inclinations must be made to appear by their discourse:
otherwise one may rightly apply to these dumb Heroes that excellent mot to of
Antiquity, Speak that I may see thee. And if from true resemblance, and
inclinations, expressed by words, we will pass unto manners, go from the
pleasant to the profitable, and from delight to example, I am to tell you,
Reader, that here virtue is seen to be always recompensed, and vice always
punished, if he that has followed his own unruliness has not by a just and
sensible repentance obtained grace from Heaven; to which purpose I have also
observed equality of manners in all the persons that do act, unless it be
whereas they are disordered by passions, and touched with remorse. I have had a
care likewise to deal in such sort, as the faults, which great ones have
committed in my History, should be caused either by love, or by ambition, which
are the noblest of passions, and that they be imputed to the evil counsel of
flatterers; that so the respect, which is always due unto Kings, may be
preserved. You shall see there, Reader, if I be not deceived, the comeliness of
things and conditions exactly enough observed; neither have I put any thing
into my Book which the Ladies may not read without blushing. And if you see not
my Hero persecuted with Love by Women, it is not because he was not amiable,
and that he could not be loved, but because it would clash with civility in the
persons of Ladies; and with true resemblance in that of men, who rarely show
themselves cruel unto them, nor in doing it could have any good grace:
Finally, whether things ought to be so, or whether I have judged of my Hero by
mine own weakness, I would not expose his fidelity to that dangerous trial,
but have been contented to make no Hilas, nor yet an Hipolitus of him. But
whilst I speak of civilitie, it is fit I should tell you (for fear I be accused
of failing therein) that if you see throughout all my Work, when as Soliman is
spoken unto, thy Highness, thy Majesty, and that in conclusion he is treated
with thee, and not with you, it is not for want of R^spect, but contrarily it
is to have the more, and to observe the custom of those people, who speak after
that sort to their Sov^raigns. And if the authority of the living may be of as
much force, as that of the dead, you shall find examples of it in the most
famous Othomans, and you shall see that their Authors have not been afraid to
employ in their own Tongue a manner of speaking, which they have drawn from the
Greek and Latin; and then too I have made it appear clearly, that I have not
done it without design; for unless it be when as the Turks speak to the Sultan,
or he to his inferiors, I have never made use of it, and either of them does
use it to each other. Now for fear it may be objected unto me, that I have
approached some incidents nearer than the History has showed them to be, great
Virgil shall be my warrant, who in his divine Aeneads has made Dido appear
four Ages after her own; wherefore I have believed I might do of some months,
what he has done of so many years, and that I was not to be afraid of erring,
as long as I followed so good a guide. I know not likewise whether some may not
take it ill, that my Hero and Heronia are not Kings; but besides that the
generous do put no difference between wearing of Crowns, and meriting them, and
that my Justiniano is of a race which has held the Empire of the Orient, the
example of Athenagoras, methinks, ought to stop their mouths, seeing
Theogines and Charida are but simple Citizens. Finally, Reader, such Censors
may set their hearts at rest for this particular, and leave me there, for I
assure them, that Justiniano is of a condition to command over the whole Earth;
and that Isabella is of a House, and Gentlewoman good enough, to make Knights
of the Rhodes, if she have children enough for it, and that she have a mind
thereunto. But setting this jesting aside, and coming to that which regards
the Italian names, know that I have put them in their natural pronounciation.
And if you see some Turkish words, as Alla, Stamboll, the Egira, and some
others, I have done it of purpose, Reader, and have left them as Historical
marks, which are to pass rather for imbellishments than defects. It is certain
that imposition of names is a thing which every one ought to think of, and
whereof nevertheless all the world has not thought: We have oftentimes seen
Greek names given to barbarous Nations, with as little reason as if I should
name an English man Mahomet, and that I should call a Turk Anthony; for my part
I have believed that more care is to be had of ones labor, and that upon this
subject men and books are to be consulted with; and if any one remarks the
name of Satrape in this Romanze, let him not imagine that my ignorance has
confounded the ancient and new Persia, and that I have done it without
Authority, I have an example thereof in Vigenere, who makes use of it in his
Illustrations upon Calchondila; and I have learned it of a Persian, which is at
Paris, who says, that by corruption of speech they call yet to this day the
Governors of Provinces, Soltan Sitripin. Now lest some other should further
accuse me for having improperly named Ibrahim's House a Palace, since all those
of persons of quality are called Seraglioes at Constantinople, I desire you to
remember, that I have done it by the counsel of two or three excellent
persons, who have found as well as my self, that this name of Seraglio would
leave an Idea which was not seemly, and that it was fit not to make use of it,
but in speaking of the Grand Signior, and that as seldom as might be. But
whilst we are speaking of a Palace, I am to advertise you, that such as are
not curious to see a goodly building, may pass by the gate of that of my Hero
without entering into it, that is to say, not to read the description of it; it
is not because I have handled this matter like to Athenagoras, who plays the
Mason in the Temple of Jupiter Hammon; nor like Poliphile in his dreams, who
has set down most strange terms, and all the dimensions of Architecture,
whereas I have employed but the ornaments thereof; it is not because they are
not beauties suitable to the Romanze, as well as to the Epique Poem, since the
most famous both of the one and the other have them; nor is it too because mine
is not grounded on the History, which assures us that it was the most superb
the Turks ever made, as still appears by the remains thereof, which they of
that Nation call Serran Ibrahim. But to conclude, as inclinations ought to be
free, such as love not those beautiful things, for which I have so much
passion, may (as I have said) pass on without looking on them, and leave them
to others more curious of those rarities, which I have assembled together with
art and care enough. Now, Reader, ingenuity being a matter necessary for a man
of Honor, and the theft of glory being the basest that may be committed, I
must confess here for fear of being accused of it, that the History of the
Count of Lavagna, which you shall see in my Book, is partly a Paraphrase of
Mascardies; this Adventure falling out in the time whilst I was writing, I
judged it too excellent not to set it down, and too well indicted for to
undertake to do it better; so that regard not this place but as a Translation
of that famous Italian, and except the matters, which concern my History,
attribute all to that great man, whose Interpreter only I am. And if you find
something not very serious in the Histories of a certain French Marquis, which
I have interlaced in my Book, remember if you please, that a Romanze ought to
have the images of all natures; that this diversity makes up the beauties of
it, and the delight of the Reader; and at the worst regard it as the sport of a
melancholic, and suffer it without blaming it. But before I make an end, I
must pass from matters to the manner of delivering them, and desire you also
not to forget, that a narrative style ought not to be too much inflated, no
more than that of ordinary conversations; that the more facile it is, the more
excellent it is; that it ought to glide along like Rivers, and not rebound up
like Torrents; and that the less constraint it has, the more perfection it
has; I have endeavored then to observe a just mediocrity between vicious
elevation, and creeping lowness; I have contained my self in narration, and
left my self free in orations, and in passions, and without speaking as
extravagants, and the vulgar, I have labored to speak as worthy persons do.

Behold, Reader, that which I had to say to you, but what defense soever I have
employed, I know that it is of works of this nature, as of a place of war,
where notwithstanding all the care the Engineer has brought to fortify it,
there is always some weak part found, which he has not dreamed of, and
whereby it is assaulted; but this shall not surprise me; for as I have not
forgot that I am a man, no more have I forgot that I am subject to err.

IBRAHIM, OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The First Part.
The First Book.
SCarcely had the first beams of the Sun dissipated the darkness of the night
on the Bosphorus of Thrace, when as a great voice of Trumpets and Atabales
awaked every one in the Imperial City of Constantinople, and made them known
that the Triumph of great Soliman was then beginning. All the people ran
instantly to the Hipodrome, and the least curious would see the magnificent
entry of that Prince, who returned conqueror from Persia. Roxelana the Sultana
Queen, followed by all the rest, parted from the Seraglio in Chariots of
Scarlet imbroidered with gold, and went to the stately standing prepared for
her. All the Christian Princes Ambassadors took their places there; first that
of the Emperor; then that of France; next to them sat those of Spain, and
Poland; and after them the Baglioes of Venice, and Rhagousa. But those of the
Mohammedan Provinces, as being of the same belief with Soliman, were on the left
hand, which amongst the Turks is always the place of honor: That of the
Tartars appeared there with a barbarous pomp in a Cap and Roab of Sables, all
his Train clad with the skins of Bears, Foxes, Wolves, and Tigers: And those
of Morocco, and Fez, were there too, with all the magnificence, and gallantry,
that Moors make profession of. As soon as each one had taken his place, the
Governor of Constantinople, whom the Turks call Capitan Bassa, and as one of
the four prime Officers of the Empire, went out of the City to the Seraglio
Daut, an house of pleasure of the Grand Signiors, some two miles off, for to
advertise his Higness, who was come thither the night before, that all things
were in a readiness to receive him. Soliman gets imediately to horse, and this
great Emperor after so glorious a conquest goes to revive the stately seat of
his Empire. Fifty Trumpets, and fifty Atabales, attired in Cassocks of Damask,
imbroidered with gold, appeared first in the Hipodrome, and made all the City
to ring with the warlike harmony of their silver instruments. They were
followed by two thousand Archers on horsback, in liveries of carnation satin,
laid thick with gold lace. Bows of ebony in their left hands, and ivory
quivers hanging on skarfes. Fifty Hoboys, and fifty players on Cimballs,
followed this first troup, habited after the Greek fashion, in blew velvet
imbroidered with silver. The Aga of the Janissaries marched on foot alone after
them in the head of six thousand of his companions, having on a robe of cloth
of gold, a jewel of rich stones, and a plume of Hearons feathers in his
Turbant, with a China battoon in his hand, which is the mark of his Charge:
All this Troop was clothed in that kind of roabe by them called Doliman, with
scymitars by their sides, and muskets on their shoulders. They were followed by
fifty Drums, and fifty Fyfes, attyred in short coats of white taffeta,
wrought with lively flowers set out with gold. After them an hundred black
Slaves, with chains of silver, and braslets of the same about their arms and
legs, carried Tachmas the Sophy of Persiaes Throne of massy gold, which had
been found in Tauris; and all the rich vessel of Agate, and Turqueys,
wherewith that Monarch was served. Next to them were twelve Elephants, and
twelve Camells led, laden with silver, gold, jewels, and precious stones,
which had been taken out of the Sophyes Treasure. A great Chariot, drawn by
twelve Barbes, followed, where hung an hundred displayed colors, which the
Turks had gained from the Persians; in the midst whereof was a stately
Trophey, composed of Curiaces and Murrians of silver engraved; Targets of gold
and Turqueyses; Scymitars and Poignards, whose hilts and scabba^ds were of
Agates and Cornalines; Bows of Ebony inlaide with gold; Quivers of gold set
with pearl; Pikes, Darts, and Arrows of Cedar wood, and Indian Cane; all
intermingled with a disorder so agreeable, and so full of art, and a confusion
so rich and beautiful, as nothing could come near to the magnificence of this
Trophry. Thirty Satrapes, sumptuously apparelled after the Persian manner, with
their Cuselbas, or red Turbants, went after that Chariot, tied two and two with
golden chains, their hands behind their backs. These illustrious wretches were
followed by five hundred Volunteers, which the Turks call Dellis, mounted on
horses barbed and caparisoned with Lions skins, having the tail of that
generous beast on the frontstalls of them, in stead of a feather; their habits
were of the skin of a Bear, their bonnets of that of a Leopard exquisitely
spotted; in those bonnets the train of an Eagle, and on their Targetts the
wing of the same bird; they had scymitars by their sides, battelaxes at their
saddle bows, and Lances in their hands, at the end whereof was an Eagles
feather in stead of a pennon. This fantastic troop was followed by a mixture
of Trumpets, Attabales, Hoboyes, European Drums, Cimballs, and Fyfes, which
composed a music little less extravagant, than the equipage of those that
preceded them. An hundred Pages rode after these same, mounted on white Barbes,
and suited in white velvet, studded with silver. Behind these Pages twenty
A^apes lead in their hands ten Horses, royally harnessed, whereof the last,
which was called the Horse of the Body, or the Horse of Battle, had the
bitt of the bridle, and the stirrupps of massive gold, all beset with precious
stones; the Saddle white all over with pearls, and sparkling with diamonds;
the Sultans Target hung at the Saddle bovv by strings of gold, at the ends
whereof great tasselles of Oriental pearls trailed to the ground. Next to
these horses marched even together the Tubenter Aga, and the Chiodar Aga, who
carried the Turbant and Mantle Imperial. Behind them Ibrahim Bassa, the the
Grand Visior, rode alone, mounted on a black Barbe, whose furniture was of
velvet of the same color, as well as the habit of that illustrious Bassa, all
imbroidered with great pearls, he carried in his hand, and without a
Scabbard, the Scymitar Imperial. The hundred Peikes, or footmen of the Grand
Signior, follovved next, but in order, with bonnets of massive silver on their
heads, in the midst vvherof white feathers of an extraordinary greatness stuck
in a quill covered with precious stones. Fifty Archers on foot went after
them, with bovves and arrows in their hands, in the midst of whom was Sultan
Soliman, arrayed in a roabe of cloth of gold, imbroidered with pearls, and
diamonds; his Turbant was ardorned with five plumes of Hearons, and as many
great jevvells of rich stones; and the furniture of his Horse was all covered
over with Emeraulds and Rubies. He was followed by all the Bassaes and
Beglierbies of the Empire. After whom a Boluch Bassa marched in the head of two
thousand Janissaries, which were the last Troops of this stately Entry. After
that this marvelous Triumph had made a turn about the Hipodrome, all ranked
themselves on the right and left hand, and the Sultan went and lighted at a
Tent of cloth of Gold, which had been pitched for him under the windows of the
Sultana Queen. All the Grandees of the Port stood on both sides; Ibrahim alone
was set at his Highness feet, on a Cushion of cloth of Silver. When every one
had taken his place, the Bassa of the Sea, who that day exercised the Charge of
the Master of the Ceremonies, advertised the Ambassadors that they might go to
the Baise-main, and offer their presents, which they had no sooner done, and
were returned to their seats, but the Mufti appeared, sitting on a Throne that
was carried on the back of a Cammell, and holding in his hands the Book of the
Alcoran. He was waited upon by all the Alfaquis, Calenders, and Dervis of the
City of Constantinople; all these Religious men cried and howled with a
dreadful poise, and to accompany their voices, and their dance, they beat upon
kettles and basins, and rung little bells; so that this modest Clergy resembled
not a little the Orgies of ancient Greece, and the Bacchanals of old Rome: When
they were before the Sultan they stood still, made prayers for the prosperity
of his Highness, offered him a Book of their Law, covered with Gold and
Turquesyes; and after they had slashed their arms and their faces with great
knives, for the love of their Prophet, and the Sultan, they retired, and gave
place to those that were to succeed them. The Turkish, Christian, and Jewish
Merchants appeared then richly attired, and in the midst of them a Chariot
drawn by twelve Cupids, crowned with flowers, upon the which was erected a shop
of cloth of Gold, and Persian Tapestry, which they presented to the Sultan. The
Goldsmiths followed them with a Cupbord of Gold Plate engraven, upon a frame of
unpolished Silver, drawn by four white Horses, which they gave to his
Highness. Every Trade appeared one after another, each of them making show of
some rich piece of workmanship of their profession; but with so extraordinary a
diligence, that before the turn of the place was finished, the Present was in
estate to be offered to great Soliman. He received them all very graciously,
and instantly gave them to his dear Ibrahim, to whom he said they were justly
due, since it was by his courage and conduct, that he had obtained the Victory,
and this Triumph. After that all these liberal Troops were past, as Turkey is
the only place in the World, where the most Juglers and Tumblers are, there
appeared above two thousand of them, who in the presence of the Grand Signior
did all, that the sleight of the hand, and all, that the address and force of
the body, could naturally permit men to. Next to them was seen the great
Frame, representing the City of Tauris, whereof the Towers were covered
with Persian Colors, as was known by their ancient Images of the Sun,
which they all had; it was follovved by two hundred Slaves, belonging to the
Bassa of the sea, half of them armed after the Turkish, and half after the
Persian manner, with scimitars and bucklers of Silver; who to the sound of
fifty Hoboys danced that which the Greeks called the Pirrhique dance, and that
which might be termed an armed dance; the blovvs were given and received in a
due cadence; the changing of figures therein, represented the advantages, and
flight which fall out in battles; and the noise of bucklers and scimitars
marked out the measure of paces with as much even time, as the instruments.
Amongst these Slaves there was one in the Turkish Troop, which by his good
aspect and behavior, drevv the eyes of all the beholders upon him; the Grand
Vizier no sooner perceived him, but he trembled with amazement and joy, no way
doubting but that it was he whom he thought he knew: In the mean time the
Frame, and the two Troops, having made a turn about the place, the City was set
down just against the Grand Signior, and the Persians cast themselves into it;
Then at the sound of all the Trumpets, Atabales, Drums, Hoboys, Fifes, and
Cimbals in the Assembly, the Turks gave an assault to that feigned City of
Tauris: If the assault were vigorous, the defense was no less; the Persians
were seen to give ground; the Turks were also seen to be repulsed; and this
false Image of of war had all the apparences of a true fight: But at length,
after a great resistance, the well-made Slave forced the gates, mounted first
on the walls, and plucking down the Sophyes Colors for to set up those of the
Sultan, his valor and address were the cause, that the Moon made the Sun to be
eclipsed; his victory was seconded with a great shout of the Janissaries, and of
all the people, and nothing was heard over all the Hipodrome, but long live
Sultan Soliman. In the mean time Ibrahim Bassa, who knew his friend no less by
his address, than by his face, was ravished to see, that all the glory of this
action could not be disputed with him. When the noise of so many voices was
dispersed, there appeared a Troop like to Christians, and observed for such by
the Crosses, which were seen in their Colors; they represented certain
Christians, who living under the Empire of the Sophy thought they were obliged
to defend that Prince, though he were not of their Religion, and indeed had
fought so generously for him, as they had been the first in the war, and yet
the last that were vanquished. This feigned Troop had order from the Bassa of
the Sea to resist for some time that of the Turks, which came at that very
instant out of the City, and then to suffer themselves to be vanquished; and
they that were attired like Turks were commanded to chain them, and to trail
their Colors on the ground: But when the fight began, that generous Slave,
who had drawn the eyes of all the Assembly upon him at the taking of the
feigned City of Tauris, fell suddenly from jesting into a more serious
thought, and being carried away by the zeal of his Religion, he passed from
the Turkish Troop into that of the Christians, and by changing of party made
the face of things to change: The Turks, whom he had left, labored to
vanquish him with the rest, but he beat them back to the very gates of the
City; and albeit they made three sallies more upon him, he repulsed them all
the three times, even to the same gates. All the world was surprised with this
adventure, and Soliman, not being able to comprehend the matter, demanded of
the Bassa of the Sea, what it meant? But the Bassa, casting himself at the feet
of his Highness, assured him that this criminal action came not from his
order, but that it proceeded from the insolency of his Slave; whereupon a
motion of choler seizing on the mind of the Grand Signior, he commanded that
this Slave should be instantly impaled. But the grand Vifier, rising from the
place where he sat, and falling on his knees, besought the Sultan that he
would not mark the day of his Triumph with blood; but remember that clemency is
properly the virtue of the Victorious; that in saving the life of this
inconsiderate he should be assured, that he would lose it for his service; and
that he was of a birth and humor never to be ungrateful; that knowing him as
well as himself, he would be responsable for him to his Highness; and that
being so far obliged unto him as to dye for to save him, he besought the Sultan
to take his life instead of his, if his fault could not obtain pardon. Soliman
reached out his hand to the illustrious Bassa, and in raising him up, said unto
him, that were the Lightning in his hand, his prayers should arrest it; and
that being unable to refuse him any thing, he granted him both the life and the
pardon of that rash man. Ibrahim cast himself again at the feet of the Sultan
for to render him thanks, and after he had obtained of the Bassa of the sea
that this slave should come and pass the night with him, he sent him a
commandment to attend him. All the magnificences of this Triumph being
finished, Soliman was going to rise, and to prepare himself for his return unto
his Seraglio, when as he perceived Osman, the Bassa of the seas only son,
who breaking through the press, and leading a woman in his hand, came and threw
himself together with her at his feet. I know well, my Lord, said he unto him,
that my presumption is extreme, but withal I know too, that thy goodness is
infinite; nevertheless I have no other need of it in this encounter, than that
thou will be pleased to permit me to acknowledge thee for a Judge, and to
obtain of thee, that in a day wherein thou receivest such glorious marks of thy
Valor, thou will render us one of thy Justice. The Bassa of the sea knowing
that he was the most interessed in the matter in hand, approached near to the
Grand Signior for to beseech him with a great deal of earnestness not to give
ear to the complaints of a man, who had been so bold as to come and interrupt
his Triumph; that for his part, although he were his son, he would crave no
favor of him for his fault, but contrarily he should be obliged to his
Highness if he would give him a chastisement, that might punish him, not only
for his crime, but for all others whereof he was also culpable. A discourse so
violent, and so far distant from the apprensions of a father, made Soliman
willing to be cleared therein, being loath in a day of his glory his people
might say, that he had refused to hear the complaint^ of the oppressed. Howbeit
he would first demand the advice of the grand Vizier Ibrahim, who having no
other aim but the glory of his Master, said unto him, that in a time wherein
Heaven had done him justice in giving him the victory over his Enemies, he
should in some sort be unjust to deny it to them that craved it of him. The
first sense of Soliman having been confirmed by the counsel of a man, who
might do all things with him, he commanded the Bassa of the sea to hold his
peace, and the woman whom Osman had brought to his feet, to tell him what
interest she had in the fortune of that man; to the end that understanding the
matter from a person that seemed least capable of disguising it, he might also
give a more equal judgment therein. That woman then having heard this
commandment, could not for all that resolve to obey it, before she had looked
on Osman, as it were to demand permission of him to answer unto it; but he
having made a sign unto her that he desired it, she turned her self toward
Soliman, with both a modest, and a confident countenance, which began already
to obtain for her the good will and attention of all that could hear her.
Alibech, so was this woman called, was young and fair, and one might have said
that her beauty had been without compare, if her complexion had not been a
little tanned with the Sun; she had a stately look, but without pride, and such
ingenuity in her face, as could not permit one to doubt of her words. After
that by Osmans countenance she knew he had permitted her to speak, she began in
these terms; for though she was originally of Persia, yet spoke she perfectly
the Turkish tongue, which she made use of in this occasion.

The History of Osman and Alibech.
I doubt not, my Lord, but thy Highness will find it strange, said this woman,
her eyes full of tears, that in a day wherein tears of joy are to be shed, I
begin my discourse with tears of sorrow; but the cause of it is so pressing,
that it is impossible for me to retain them; for, my Lord, thou see before
thine eyes, said she, showing Osman, two of the most unfortunate persons that
ever were; we have enemies whom we cannot, whom we ought not hate; to whom we
ow respect; to whom we ow obedience; to whom we ow affection; enemies, I say,
to whom we ow our lives, and for whom also we would lose them with joy if there
were occasion for it: Nevertheless it is against such dear persons, my Lord,
that I am to speak at this time; and for obtaining the justice which we demand
of thee, and whereupon depends the happiness or unhappiness of our lives, I
must discover the cruelties of my father, and Osman must accuse his: Judge
then, my Lord, whether my tears be not just, and whether loving our enemies, as
we do, we be not exposed to an extreme misfortune in being thus constrained to
publish their shame, to accuse them, and to demand justice against them.
Alibech found her self so oppressed with sorrow, that she stood a good while
unable to speak. But Soliman having commended so sweet a resentment in her, and
having commanded her once again to let him understand their differences, she
continued her discourse. Since I must, said she, obey, and that I cannot
conserve my husband without discovering the misfortunes of my father, I must, I
say, let thy Highness know, that his name is Arsalon; that he was born the
subject of the Sophy of Persia; and that in the time he was in that Court he
was Satrap of Aderbion, and so considerable with Tachmas, as there was not any
person in that Empire, who was more than he; but whereas his humor has been
always violent in every thing, being become desperately in love with a maid of
excellent beauty, of great virtue, and of much spirit, he espoused her, though
she were of base condition: And whereas the Laws of the State do not permit a
Gentleman to mary a wife that is not noble, they also will that the great ones,
which commit such like offenses, shall lose the honors and charges they
possess, and be declared ignoble, and incapable of all manner of dignities. My
father was not ignorant of this custom and law; but he was persuaded that
Tachmas would have infringed it for his sake; and if he would not, that want of
affection would be a reason strong enough to oblige him to make the Province
revolt, where he commanded, and whereof he believed he was absolutely the
Master; howbeit the matter succeeded not so, for the enemies which my Father
had made him by his violences, meeting with so fair an occasion to hurt him,
they represented unto the Sophy, that if he pardoned him this fault, it would
make him the more insolent for the future, yea and that it would even overthrow
all that Empire, the glory and force whereof consisted in the valor of noble
persons, wherewith it is replenished; at length they wrote in such manner, that
my Father was declared guilty, as contravening the fundamental Laws of the
State, and constrained to undergo the chastisement, which I shall come to speak
of, by reason that the Province, where he commanded so absolutely when he was
in grace, revolted against him, and left him not scarcely the liberty to seek a
refuge otherwhere; for I forgot to tell thy Highness, that the same Law which
commanded the utter ruin of my Father, commanded also that he should pass his
life in a perpetual prison, and the person whom he had married in another, for
fear that living together, and having children, it might one day cause
disorders in the State. My Father seeing himself in so pitiful a fortune, went
not about to move the heart of Tachmas with payers and submission, but
contrarily sent him word, that deserving not to be served by a man of his
courage and valor, he would go out of his Estates, with an intention never to
re-enter into them again, but to bring war along with him. Being then in
Mingrelia, he bought a Man of War, wherein he imbarqued himself on Mare major,
with his wife, who as she was the cause of his misfortune, so would she not
abandon him in his exile. They continued some time in this sort, not knowing
what resolution to take, nor having any other design in the course that they
held, than to cloign themselves from Persia; my Fathers great heart not
permitting him to go and seek unto the enemies of Tachmas for a place of
retreat; for though he be somewhat cruel, yet is he notwithstanding generous;
neither would he likewise address himself to the Princes that were allied to
our Empire, for fear he should not be favorably received by them. In the mean
time these irresolutions having no end, the provisions of the ship diminished
daily: The Pilot was well hoped up to ask him where he would land, when as he
found no place in the whole universal Map vvhither to go. Six months past
away in this sort in running over all the Seas of the Levant; and whereas my
mother was with child of me, at such time as she imbarqued her self, she was
not far from the term wherein I was to see the light, when as Arsalons
victuals utterly failed him; and having employed all his money in the buying
of the Vessel, and such provisions of War, and for the mouth, as he had laid
into her, he knew not what part to repair unto for the supplying of himself in
so adverse an adventure. The soldiers and Mariners consulted together, and
having gained the Pilot, they wrought so with him, that maugre the command my
Father had given him to the contrary, he steered directly to an Island which
they had discovered; whereupon Arsalon being in a rage to see his authority
contemned, went and pushed away the Pilot so rudely for to make him abandon the
helm, as the poor wretch fell into the Sea; and my Father becoming his own
Pilot, he took his scimitar in his right hand, and the whip of the rudder in
his left, and menacing them that would oppose his will, he made his Vessel
take a quite contrary course, choosing rather to die by famine, than expose his
misery to the eyes of the world, fearing nothing so much as that Tachmas should
come to understand his misfortunes. He had already lost sight of that Hand,
which he had beheld as a rock, and his soldiers being no longer retained but
by the tears of my Mother, might at length peradventure have been carried to
some strange resolution, without an adventure that befell them, which was, that
my Father discovered a Vessel coming toward his, which bare a Flag of Persia
in her top, as he thought, and as indeed it proved to be: Upon the sight of her
he began to think, that he should be revenged of Tachmas in revenging himself
upon his Subjects; and this desire of revenge, joined to the present necessity,
made him propound to his soldiers the attacquing of that Vessel, who animated
more by the fear of famine, than by their courage, resolved to obey his
pleasure. After my Father had shut up my Mother in the Captains Cabin, where
with fright she was brought to bed of me by the assistance of her Nurse, who
had never abandoned her, they set upon the Vessel, and after two hours fight
rendered themselves absolute Masters of her, wherein they found extreme riches,
and abundance of Victual. This victory gave new life to his soldiers, who for
the valor which my Father had showed in this occasion, grew so devoted unto
him, as they craved pardon of him for resisting his will, and swore never to
forsake him; he to win them the more, divided the booty amongst them, reserving
nothing for himself but the glory of having vanquished. After this, my Lord, he
took a resolution to have no other Country but his ship, and to pass all the
rest of his life upon all the Seas of the world, to seek out all occasions of
fighting, and to take all the Vessels that should carry the Colors of Persia,
or all that belonged to the Enemies of our Religion, which are the Christians:
He propounds this design to his soudiers, who approve it, and albeit my Mother
withstood it, he settled this resolution at last. Behold, my Lord, in what sort
my Father has lived for the space of eighteen years that I have been in the
world, and that which has gotten him so much fame under the name of Arsalon
the Pirate throughout all the Seas that are known to us. I have not for all
that been always brought up in so wild an element, for whereas he diverse times
arrived at Hands to sell off the commodities which he had taken, he left me
from the age of six years until fourteen, at which time he took me to him
again, under the government of a woman of the Isle of Cyprus, who truly had a
great deal of care of me. Thy Highness may be pleased to dispense with me for
the relating to thee all the sad victories which my Father has obtained in so
long a time, and withal wilt pardon me if I have extended my self in this
discourse more than I ought, for to make it appear, that the life which my
father has led, has rather been an effect of his great heart, and of his
despair, than of the baseness and viciousness of his mind: But, my Lord, to
come unto that which directly regards me, it was not full six days after my
Father had taken me away from the Isle of Cyprus, whenas my Mother fell sick,
and died in my arms; this loss no doubt was very sensible unto me, and Arsalon
was so afflicted with it, as no man could be more; howbeit this grief produced
very different effects in us; I shed tears, and he spilt blood, for melancholy
being joined to his violent humor, he sought no other remedy for his
affliction than to make others miserable like him self. We ran then over all
the Archipelago, and all the Sea of Tuscany; and during that voyage he made
many fights, and took many prizes, amongst the rest a little Barque, where a
man of a good aspect, and that was an Italian, defended himself so
courageously, that Arsalon, vex^ at his resistance, had peradventure caused him
to be slain, if I had not obtained his life. When he was in the hands of my
Father, he was chained amongst those whom he judged were handsome enough to be
sold in places where he had accustomed to traffic; but he soon changed this
design, for this new Slave having given him to understand by an Interpreter,
which my Father had, who spoke most languages, for the commodity of his
Commerces, that he was a man of quality, he agreed with him on a price for his
ransom, and gave him his word, that if the sum which he had promised, were paid
him at the Isle of Cyprus, he would set him at liberty: This Slave having
confirmed this promise unto him, my Father permitted him to write unto the
place whence he said he was of, and so going to the Isle of Cyprus, he gave
this Letter to Merchants, with whom he held correspondence, that undertook to
cause it to be delivered; my Father promising this Slave, that within three
months he would return thither for an answer of it; but in the mean time that
he must for his security go along with him: This man not knowing what to do,
but to follow the Law of the Vanquisher, resolved to submit to that which he
could not avoid. Not long after we encountered a great man of War, in whose Flag
my Father observed half Moons; and whereas all his prizes were seldom or never
made of any save of Persians, or Christians, he purposed not to meddle with
her, but contrarily commanded his Pilot to quit his course, that so he might
decline her; but whereas Arsalon was taken for a Pirate, and this change of
course seemed to be a flight unto him who commanded that Vessel, he made up
with full sayls unto us, the better to discern ours, and having well discerned
her, he came presently and grapled himself fast unto us. I cannot say, my Lord,
what this fight was, because the fright I was in kept me from marking it,
howbeit I know that at the very first, they of that Vessel leaped into ours;
and whereas there were many of my Fathers soldiers sick, they might
peradventure have rendered themselves Masters of her without the valor of the
Italian Slave, who seeing that they which attacqued us were not Christians,
demanded leave of Arsalon to fight, who having given him arms, gave him
wherewithal to gain us the victory; for he performed such mavelous things in
this fight, as after he had repulsed the enemy, he leaped into their Vessel,
followed by my Father, and some of his, put very near all that he met with
there to the sword, rendered himself Master of her, and with his own hand,
after a long resistance, took Osman, who commanded her, and who by his Fathers
order was going to Alexandria. After this brave exploit, this Slave was the
favorite of Arsalon, of which grace notwithstanding he was not much sensible;
for though my Father caressed him extremely, yet left he not to be exceedingly
afflicted, when as he knew that the reward of his victories should be a
perpetual slavery; for albeit my Father had promised to give him his liberty,
when as he should have received his ransom, he had resolved nevertheless to
break his word with him, for that he might not, said he, part with a man which
could make him invincible by his wonderful valor. In the mean time, my Lord,
Osman finding himself wounded, and my inclination having always carried me to
the comforting of others miseries, I visited him whilst he was ill, and more
for the care that I had of his person, as long as he was so, than for any
beauty was in my face, he bare an affection to me; and if I dare say it, the
knowledge which I had thereof, together with his merit, and the compassion I
had of his misfortune, very much disposed me to accept of it; the constancy
which he showed was partly the cause of my weakness, if at leastwise one may
call an affection so, which has no other object but virtue. As soon as Osman
was taken, he told Arsalon what he was, who gave him the means to let the Bassa
of the Sea understand what ransom he was set at, and how he might deliver him;
in the mean time, his hurts being cured, he contracted a great friendship with
that generous Slave, speaking a certain corrupted Italian unto him, which, they
say, is very much in use here in Constantinople. As for me, after I parted from
the Isle of Cyprus, my chiefest entertainmens was to talk with the Interpreter,
whom my Father carried always along with him, and by the continual conference
which we had together, touching the diversities of Languages, I had almost
learned two or three, if not for to speak them well, at leastwise to understand
them perfectly; and whereas the Turkish and Italian were of that number, I did
also many times converse with those two unfortunate ones, thinking I had passed
away the day exceeding well, when I could avoid the company of those men of
blood and slaughter that follovved my Father. Thus I spent most of my time,
either in the Captains Cabin with my Mothers Nurse, or in their conversation.
They knevv well enough by my sadness, that the life which I led was grievous
unto me, yet had they the goodness not to speak to me of it but modestly, nor
to complain of their own misfortunes in consideration of me: This compliance
and advisedness of theirs made me to esteem much of them both; and the belief I
had that I was beloved of Osman possessed me both with joy, and with
unquietness; for I perceived sufficiently, that his heart yielded not without
resisting, and that he was ashamed to wear the fetters of a Pirates daughter:
This generous disposition of his for all that displeased me not, and making
great account of him already, I interpreted every thing to his advantage; I
found that he had reason to revolt against himself, and not to give way to a
passion unworthy of him, yet forbore I not to make vows in secret, that he
might know how far my disposition was from that of my fathers, but yet I durst
not bring any care to justify my self therein, because I could not do it
without blaming him that gave me life. We lived in this sort with some
delight, and a great deal of unquietness; the Italian Slave was afflicted to
see my father break his word with him, and seemed also to be so for that he
could have no tidings of a friend of his whom he infinitely regretted; as for
Osman, and my self, we knew not what to wish for; he was grieved for that he
could not hear from his father, and yet feared to quit me; I likewise made vows
for his liberty, and yet feared nothing more. What, said I to my self
sometimes, shall I pass my whole life with men, whose cruelty is all their
virtue? shall I always be exposed to tempests? Shall I never see other than
miserable wretches? And it may be too after that I shall die the Slave of a
Pirate. I vow to thee, my Lord, this thought was a torment unto me; and albeit
the conversation of Osman gave me some pleasing hours, yet could I say that I
was most unhappy: But I was a great deal more a little after, because the term,
which my father had given the Bassa of the Sea for the redemption of his son,
being past, he was treated more harshly than before, and kept in the rank of
those Slaves, which he meant to sell in Christian land. This resolution, being
known to Osman, and me, wrought a strange effect in us, and the love which we
bore one to another, and which we had both of us concealed as much as we could,
began then to break forth. I could not speak to him of my fathers designs but
with tears in mine eyes, nor could he talk to me of an eloignment, which he
believed to be inevitable, without declaring his affection openly unto me; I
believed, my Lord, that it was true, thinking it was not a time fitting to
dissemble in; he assured me that his irons did not seem heavy unto him, as long
as he was with me, but the thought of being separated from me for ever, and to
be constrained to carry chains otherwhere, was insupportable to to him; he
swear to me further, that he had not desired his liberty but to obtain of his
father, against whom he had never so much as once murmured, the means to
deliver me out of the hands of mine. A discourse so obliging found not an
ungrateful soul, and I resolved to do what I could to keep my father from
executing so ignoble a design; I cast my self then at his feet, I begged this
grace of him with tears, but for all the effect of my request I got nothing,
save an express inhibition never to speak to him more of it. After that he
always treated me ill; I had no longer the liberty to entertain Osman as
before; and we were all three for a long time together the most unhappy
persons that ever were. This constraint for all that kept me not from letting
him know at length, that if he would promise to mary me I would undeavour to
deliver him, so as he would be ruled by me: Osman answered thereunto very
obligingly, that loving me so much, as to hazard his life for to make me his, I
was not to doubt, but that meeting with two such great benefits together, he
would do whatsoever I would have him for to obtain them. After he had sworn
more than once to me, that if I would procure him his liberty, and would
follow him, he would receive me for his wife, I required some time for the
execution of my design; but whereas I could not finish it without betraying in
some sort my father, it is certain that I almost repented me of my engaging my
self therein: I was persuaded notwithstanding that virtue and reason were of my
side, and that regarding Osman as my husband, I might be permitted to follow
him, desiring nothing of all my fathers riches, than this only Slave, which I
robbed him of. Being well confirmed then in my design, I examine, I consider the
difficulties of it, and find no other way to execute it, than to stay till we
came to the Isle of Chio, whither my father was to go, and there to cast
anchor; for whereas he had caused the Captains Cabin to be divided in the
midst, to the end that I should lie on the one side, and he on the other, and
that Osman also was every night locked up with a key, which Arsalon himself
always kept by him, I resolved to steal it as softly as I could from him; but
the difficulty was, that ever since he purposed to retain the Italian Slave, he
for to favor him, but indeed to assure himself of him, made him to lie with
him. I resolved then to propound unto him his escaping out of my fathers hands;
at first he doubted it was but to try him, that I spoke so to him, and withal
his own generosity withstood it, but having acquainted him with the truth of
the matter, he believed me, and said, that seeing my father had broken his word
with him, he might fail in his fidelity to him also; and on condition that
Osman would promise him his freedom, he would expose himself to any thing for
my sake. I assured him of what he desired, and having so good a second it was
not hard for me to finish my enterprise. But without importuning thy Highness,
my Lord, by a long relation, let it suffice to say, we were no sooner at the
road of Chio, where Osman had some acquaintance, but night being come, and my
father a sleep, I went and stole away the key of the Cabin, wherein Osman was
lo^ked; and the generous Slave, having shut up my father in his, where he
soundly slept, came along with me to unlose his friend, snatched away a
sentinells arms that would have cried out, and having killed him, as well as
the Pilot, we got into the skiff, and for the more surety, the generous Slave
with a blow of his scimitar cut asunder the cable that held the vessel at
anchor, which by the light of the Moon we saw fall away from us, and float at
the pleasure of the wind, without a Pilot, or any man awake in her. In the mean
time Osman and that Slave rowed with such speed, as we soon approached to land,
where we happily arrived; and meeting with a sanctuary in the house of one, who
knew Osman ^t Ch^o, we in a little time found the means to come unto
Constantinople, leaving Arsalon no doubt in an extreme rage at our flight,
which was made with much the more security, for that my father seldom suffered
his great Vessel to enter into any Port that was suspected unto him, but sent
a Barque in for the dispatch of such business as he had to do there, and upon
that it was that I had grounded my enterprise. Now, my Lord, after I had
delivered Osman with the help of the generous Slave, and had brought him back
to his paternall house, when he would have made good his word which he had
given us, this incensed father has entreated me as an infamous person, and a
vagabond, and has put that Slave into irons, to whom his son owes his
liberty, since that without him I could not have executed that which I had
promised; it is that Slave, my Lord, whom thou have so lately pardoned, and of
whom the Illustrious Ibrahim has undertaken the protection. Behold, my Lord,
the difference that is between the Bassa of the Sea, and his son, whose sense
I will not deliver, for fear I should be suspected to interpret it too
advantagiously for my self; wherefore it is for thy Highness to understand it
from his own mouth, and absolutely to dispose of my happiness, or of my
unhappiness, of my life, or of my death. Alibech having given over speaking, a
confused noise was heard, which seemed to judge the matter for her advantage;
but Soliman, desiring to render equal Justice, commanded the Bassa of the Sea
to speak his intentions. I have no other, my Lord, said he, than to chase from
my house a woman, that ought to be driven from all the earth, and whose
disposition is so base and unjust, that she could love a captive, when she knew
him not for that which he was, and betray her father; a woman descended from a
Pirate, nourished amidst blood and cruelty, brought up amongst wicked villains
whom the earth cannot bear, and the daughter of a Persian thy Highness enemy:
Behold what this woman is whom my son will mary, and for all her estate
brings nothing with her but infamy; he will tell me, it may be, that he owes
his liberty to her, and I will answer him, that it is a good which she has not
done him, but to do it for her self; she knew he was the son of a Bassa,
that he had Palaces, that he was rich, and that he was honored with thy
Highness favors; she betrayed her father to possess them, and has not so much
followed my son, as she has sought after his good fortune; and then who
knows whether her hatred to Arsalon is not rather the cause of her flight,
than her love to Osman? She was weary of living in a continual prison, and to
speak truly of things, she owes her liberty rather to Osman, than my son does
ow his to her, since that at length a ransom might have redeemed him, whereas
nothing could have drawn her out of her fathers hands. What assurance can one
place in a person, that gives no marks of her affection but treasons; that
stifles all the motions of nature, to follow those wherewith she is inspired by
a disordinate love; and that begins her marriage with an impiety? Believe me,
Osman, said the Bassa beholding him, she that has been so audacious, as to
betray her father for to follovv a Slave, may yet more easily betray an husband
for a man of free condition; she that could so cunningly steal away the keys
of a sleeping father, may peradventure, being become the more daring by the
happy success of her former designs, stab a dagger into the heart of an
husband, when as she shall be as weary of him, as she was of her father. And
then, my Lord, said he, turning himself to Soliman, who knows whether all that
she has said be not a trick, and that being the daughter of a Persian, she
comes not hither to observe what is done here, and seek occasion to hurt us?
Howsoever it be, I find that she ought to be suspected of us, and that in this
encounter my particular interest is the same with the public. As for the
freedom of the Slave, whom thy Highness has been pleased to pardon, I have no
more to say, for to make it appear, that I am not obliged to render it unto
him, than that he is the cause of all the pain I am in, seeing that he alone,
as this woman her self says, made Osman the slave of Arsalon; let my son
keep his word with him, if he can, but as for me, I have promised him nothing;
I will retain him in irons, not only as a Christian, not only as a Captive, but
also as an enemy. Behold, my Lord, what my sense is in this occasion, which, as
I think, is not far from reason. Soliman seeing that the Bassa of the sea had
done speaking, told Osman that he was to declare his mind. I am very sorry,
replied he, that I must be constrained to contradict a man to whom I ow my
life, and to have that cross conformity with the virtuous Alibech, as to have a
father as inexorable as hers is cruel; but, my Lord, since the prime duty ought
to prevail over all others, and that reason will have me speak without fear in
this occasion, I will beseech thine Highness to consider, whether I can without
ingratitude, and without being the basest of all men, abandon a person, who
has abandoned all for me, and that, as one may say, has made her self a slave
to deliver me, since that remitting her self to my conduct, and relying on my
word, it was no longer in her power to alter her mind, but was necessarily to
follow my will. Can I consider, that even at this present I should be laden
with Irons, exposed to the insolency of Pirates, and the cruelty of Arsalon, if
this woman had not broken my chains, and not have for her all the affection,
and all the acknowledgment whereof I am capable? As soon as I was a captive,
she began to do me good; I was wounded, she had a care of me, with her
charitable offices she healed the wounds which her father had given me; I no
sooner saw her, but I knew her virtue; she comforted the afflicted, took care
to relieve them; and to say all in a word, she bewailed the Victories of her
father, because she believed them not to be just. I confess ingenuously, that
the beauty of her mind moved me more, than that of her face; and finding my
self surprised by the luster of so great a virtue, I engaged my self in such
sort unto her, as nothing can be able to change it: But if virtue be the
foundation of the love I bear her, that which she bears me has had no less
noble a cause: She saw me constant enough in my misfortune, she saw me wounded,
a captive, and ready to be sold into a strange Country, and knew, though she
seemed to be ignorant of it, that I loved her much; the gorgiousness of my
clothes did not win her; for they were all torn in the heat of the fight; I was
wan and disfigured; she saw me abandoned of my father, of whom I had no news;
ill-entreated by Arsalon, because he had lost the hope of my ransom; and
f^nally, in a more deplorable estate than ever man was seen: Love then did not
enter into her heart by voluptuousness, but I can say it was introduced
thereinto by goodness, acknowledgement, and compassion; for if she had not been
pitiful, she had not assisted me when I was ill, she had not loved me; if she
had not been acknowledging, she had despised the love of a slave, that had not
the liberty to do her any service; and if her heart had not been tender, she
had not been moved with my misfortunes, nor given an end to them. It is true,
that she is the daughter of the Pirate Arsalon; that she has quitted her
father to follow me; that she has been brought up amongst cruel and bloody
men; and that she is the daughter, not only of a Pirate, but of a Persian. But,
my Lord, all this, which seems to make against me, makes for me in this
occasion: for what greater mark can one desire of a solid and immovable
virtue, than to see a woman of eighteen years of age, whose inclinations are
not corrupted amidst so many vices, and whose innocence is preserved so
entire, as she could not so much as excuse cruelty in her father? It is true,
that she has followed me, but it was to see no more murders, nor fights, and
because she saw a juster temper in my mind: She has not betrayed her father to
follow a slave, but she has quitted the Pirate Arsalon to deliver a husband;
for having promised to be so unto her, nothing but death alone can keep me from
it. Moreover, my Lord, she is not to be suspected of thy Highness, for though
she be the daughter of a Persian, it is of a Persian the enemy of Tachmas, who
has for these eighteen years waged War against him. I will not stand to say,
that this woman, albeit the daughter of a Pirate, is for all that of a noble
extraction, because the Mussulmans make Nobility personal, and believe that it
ought not to pass unto children; but I will only say, that in the estate
wherein my fathers fortune now is, all that can be desired in a woman is
contracted in this same; she is fair, she loves me, and she is virtuous. It is
true, that she is without wealth, and without parents, but she has lost them
for the love of me; and whereas by thy bounty my father has no need, either of
support, or of riches, what can I wish for more in a Wife? If I take one that
is rich, it may be she will abandon me if I should happen to fall into misery,
but this that I have chosen will be the companion of all my misfortunes, without
any fear that ever she will quit me. I know that I ow a great deal of respect
to my father, but I know that I ow my life and my liberty to this woman; I must
then love both the one and the other, or keep my word which I have given her;
for if my father will not suffer himself to be persuaded, we will go
voluntarily into banishment; we are already accustomed to misfortune, and the
misery that we shall endure together will no doubt be more supportable to us,
than greatness and riches would be if we were separated. As for the generous
Slave, to whom I have promised liberty, I know not by what reason my father can
pretend any right to deprive him of it; he is neither his slave nor mine; and
by the severest law of War he can lay no claim at all unto him: He is a
Christian I acknowledge, but all the Christians here in Constantinople wear not
fetters; he is a captive, but that is to Arsalon, and not to him; and a captive
too, who after a breach of promise might with justice break his chains; nor
has he sought for liberty but to give it me, and that is it peradventure that
has made my father his enemy. It is true also that he took me, but it was in a
just fight; by that reason I am his slave, rather than he is mine. Let thy
Highness so order it, if it be possible, that I may acquit me as I ought.
Behold all the crimes, my Lord, that I have committed; my father would have me
perfidious and ungrateful, and I had rather my father should hate me with
injustice, than love me unjustly. The generous Alibech seeing that Osman had
made an end of speaking, and having observed by the Bassa of the seas
countenance, that the discourse had rather incensed, than persuaded him, turned
her self to Osman, with tears in her eyes, and conjured him to obey his father;
I will not, said she unto him, have you faulty for the love of me; and since
our affection cannot be innocent, extinguish it in your heart, and leave me the
care of conserving it in mine; remember that you are the son of the Bassa of
the sea, and that you are not yet my husband; you cannot dispense with your
self for that first duty, and fortune does dispense with you for the other; I
hold you acquitted of the promise which you cannot perform to me without a
crime, and I desire nothing of you but a will to obey your father; when I shall
see you resolved so to do, I will get me away alone. Alas! said Osman,
interrupting her, in what part of the World could thou find a place of
refuge? All the Elements are contrary to us; the sea has no security for us,
nor is the land more favorable unto us; thy father and mine do banish us from
them both, and nothing but death alone can finish our miseries. Soliman being
touched with the pity of such tender apprehensions, would not leave them long
in pain; and though the Bassa of the sea would have replied, he forbad him to
withstand his pleasure; but whereas he knew, that the true reason wherefore he
opposed the passion of his son, was avarice, so ordinary amongst the Turks,
he told him, after he had consulted with Ibrahim, that the virtue of Alibech
had charmed him in such sort, as he would adopt her for his daughter, and how
in that quality he would give her three hundred thousand Sultannies in marriage
with her, commanding him to receive her for the wife of his son, and to
entreat her as if she were his daughter, assuring him that he would hold the
place of father unto her, and that he would interess himself in all that
regarded her. That for the Slave whom he had already pardoned, it was his
pleasure, that he should remit him into the hands of Ibrahim to dispose of him
as he would. The Bassa of the sea, who indeed had found no other defect in the
virtuous Alibech, than poverty, seeing her to be rich by the bounty of the
Sultan, changed his choler into giving of thanks, and assured Soliman that he
should be obeyed. Osman and Alibech rendered him such acknowledgement as was
answerable to the favor they had received, and went away with as much
satisfaction, as they had had sorrow: But it was Solimans pleasure, that
Alibech should first go and kiss the Robe of Roxelana, who was still at the
standing, where she had seen the Triumph. In the mean time, the day being near
to an end, the magnificences of this Triumph ended also by a volley of
Musket Shot discharged by the Janissaries, which was answered by all the great
Ordnance of the seven Towers, and that of all the Galleys. Great Soliman then
retired to the Seraglio, with the Sultana Queen, attended upon by all the
Troops, which afterward conducted the Grand Vizier to his, he that by his
valor and prudence had been the only cause of Solimans Triumph.

IBRAHIM, OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The First Part.
The Second Book.
IBrahim Bassa, being unable to vanquish the secret melancholy which he carried
in his breast, could not amidst all his Victories, and all the honors he had
received, keep it from being as visible in his eyes, as it was sensible to his
heart. The Conquests which he had made of the Persians, the Battails which he
had won against the Rebels of Asia, had indeed filled the whole extent of the
Empire of the Mussulmans with gladness: but this general rejoicing made not
his particular; neither were utility and glory considerations strong enough to
give unto his mind only that first motion which precedeth joy. He was not
ignorant, that fortune had not abased him, but to raise him infinitely; howbeit
he knew likewise, that she had given him that which he desired not at all, and
that she had taken from him the only thing which made up all his desires, and
all his ambition; he perfectly knew, that the more happy he was for another,
the more unfortunate he was for himself; and a news which he had heard the day
before from Arsalons slave, had stirred up so great a trouble in his mind, and
agitated it with so much violence, as forgetting all things to abandon himself
to grief, he remembered not that he was obliged to be present at the rising of
great Soliman, of whom he was beloved with so much tenderness, as he alone had
permission to enter into the Seraglio as often as he pleased, a favor so
extraordinary, that it had never been granted to any person. He had also made
choice of our Illustrious Bassa to be not only his Grand Vizier, but to repose
himself upon him for all the affairs of the Empire. It was he that commanded
the Armies; it was he that made the Sangiacs, and gave them the Government of
Provinces; it was he that presided in the Counsel of State, and that alone
formed the resolution thereof in the Sultans Cabinet: Ibrahim was so powerful,
that he wanted nothing but the sole name of Emperor, to be the chief of all the
Orient. In the mean time these favors of fortune could not keep him from
holding himself the wretchedest of all men; it was in this irksom thought that
the Aga of the Janissaries found him, when as he came to tell him, that the
Grand Signior complained of his sloth, and that it was his pleasure he should
come away unto him. Ibrahim, surprised with this commandment, which made him
see the fault he had committed, did what he could to conceal his grief from the
Aga; howbeit he perceived that there was some unquietness in his mind; Ibrahim
told him notwithstanding that he would go straightway and justify himself to
his Highness, and that if he durst he would rejoice for having committed this
offense, since thereby he received so notable a favor. After this complement he
went to the Seraglio, where at first when the Sultan saw him, he observed some
extraordinary matter in his face; and whereas the Bassa had past the night
without sleeping, his countenance seemed to him to be changed, he appeared to
him very melancholic, and his humor being more unquiet than usual, he
pressed him to let him understand the cause thereof; but perceiving that
Ibrahim answered not precisely, he demanded of him whether he had any ill news
to tell him? Whether the Provinces which he had conquered were revolted?
Whether the forces which he had left in the Frontiers of Persia, were defeated?
Or whether he had discovered any conspiracy against the State, or against his
Person? To all these things the grand Vizier answered from point to point; that
thanks be to Heaven, he had nothing to tell him that could be displeasing unto
him; that the Provinces which his Armies had conquered were peaceable; that his
Camp had nothing to fear, it being unlikely that the relics of two Battles,
which the Enemies had lost, should be of so sufficient power, as to dare to
present themselves before an Army victorious, as his was; that for the
Conspiracies whereof he spoke, he besought his Highness to believe that his
Empire was so well settled, as there was no force able to shake so great a Body;
that for that which regarded his person, his Government was so just, as all
strange people beheld it with envy, and all his Subjects with joy. The Bassa
had no sooner made an end of speaking, but the Sultan said unto him very
obligingly, Why then, Ibrahim, since thy melancholy proceeds not from any thing
that regards me, it must needs be something that concerns thee in particular,
and as I am no less sensible on that side, than on the other, I will know
absolutely of thee, what it is that troubles thy mind; for though thou have
labored to put on a joyful countenance in answering me, yet have thou not for
all that destroyed the opinion which I have conceived. Ibrahim, seeing himself
so nearly pressed, could not forbear blushing, and thinking on what he was to
say, he cast down his eyes, and seemed to be stricken dumb, which the Sultan
having observed, embraced him, and said, No, Ibrahim, do not seek to disguise
the truth unto me, I will know it of what importance soever it may be: Look
not on me in this confidence, as on thy Sovereign, but as on Soliman, that is
to say, as on a man that will partake with thee in all the good, and in all
the evil that can arrive unto thee; thy courage has made thee shed blood
enough in my service to oblige me to pay it with some tears, if it be so that
I cannot bring other remedy to thy grief. The Grand Vizier casting himself at
the Sultans feet, rendered him thanks for all the bounty he had shevved him; and
whereas he had leisure during Solimans discourse, to invent a pretext for his
displeasure, he besought him to pardon him, if in obeying his Highness he
should say something, that would clash in some sort with the respect which he
owed him. After that the Sultan had made him to rise, and had sworn to him,
that he would not be offended with any discourse he should use to him, Ibrahim
began to speak in this manner; I know well, my Lord, that my melancholy is
criminal; that the cause of it is unjust; and that thy Highness cannot know it
without condemning me; but since thy Majesty has commanded me to discover it,
I must confess that I never turn mine eyes to behold the baseness from whence
thy Almighty hand has drawn me, but I tremble with amazement; the place where
thou have set me is so high, as it is not altogether without reason that I fear
to be precipitated from it; and I find my self in the view of so many people,
as I hold it almost impossible, but that the malice or envy of some should make
me lose that which thou alone have given me; nevertheless I am not ignorant
that the same hand, which has lifted me up, can sustain me; but, my Lord, if
the respect which I ow to thy Highness, would permit me to represent unto thee
the most remarkable changes which have happened in this Empire, thou would
acknowledge, that having received far more than I have merited, I have reason
to apprehend that that may be one day taken from me by justice, which thou have
given me by bounty. The pitiful adventure of Achmat under Bajazet the second,
has furnished matter for all those that have succeeded in his dignity, never
to think themselves secure: He had confirmed the Throne of Bajazet; he had been
the only man that mounted him into it; in the mean time for a recompense of all
his services he was strangled by two Slaves. But, my Lord, not to go so far to
seek for examples, that of Chassan Bassa, Vizier under the reign of an Emperor,
who could not be but great, seeing he has given birth to thy Majesty, is not
he able to strike fear into the firmest and most innocent soul? since for
giving good counsel, which had not been successful if it had been followed, he
lost that life which he had so many times hazarded for the safety of this
Empire: I should not have been so bold, as to have spoken of this adventure in
this occurrence, had I not remembered, that I have heard thy Highness bemoan the
misfortune of that great man: Now therefore demand no longer of me the cause of
my grief, seeing thy Majesty knows it as well as my self; but if it be true
that I am beloved of thee, as I cannot doubt of it without a crime, pardon only
my weakness, and believe not that the discourse which I have made is an effect
of my ambition. I know too well, my Lord, that I cannot go higher, and for that
reason it is that I fear the inconstancy of fortune, who being unable to raise
me more, shall be constrained to destroy me for to follow her natural
inclination; it is an order which she has kept in all ages, and I dare not
hope that she will break it in favor of me. But, my Lord, were I assured that
she would be contented with bereaving me of all the honors, which I have
received from thy Greatness, and that she would leave me heavy laden with
chains, as I was when it pleased thy Highness to free me of them, provided (I
say) that she would not deprive me of thy Grace, I should be untroubled, and
live more happily being thy Slave, than now I do being full of glory and
favors. The Sultan having hearkened to this discourse with a great deal of
patience, could not at length forbear interrupting him; I thought, Ibrahim,
said he, that I had opened my heart so well unto thee, and so thoroughly showed
thee my Love, as there rested nothing more for thee, either to fear, or to
desire; but since I am deceived in my conjectures, I will pardon thy weakness,
and if it be possible I will cure thee of it. I could, if I would, find some
excuse for the violences which my predecessors have used during their reigns,
and tell thee, that in an Empire which was not as then well settled, it was in
some sort convenient to lean rather toward rigor, than toward clemency; but
I will not undertake to make their apology serve my turn against thee; that
which was just in their times, would not be reasonable in these; wherefore I
will employ other remedies, which, if I be not deceived, will make thee know,
that Sliman can tell how to chain up fortune when he pleases, and that he is
resolved, to measure thine with his life. The Bassa would have answered to so
obliging a speech, but the Sultan staying him said; I think, Ibrahim, thou have
not forgotten, that it is by the means of the Sultana, my daughter Asteria,
that I have the commodity to see thee in my service. I should be too
ing^atefull, replied the Bassa, if I should not remember, that I ow my life
unto her, and that which is yet more precious unto me, I ow her the honor of
serving the greatest Monarch of the world. That being, said Soliman, thou
need not doubt, that the design which I have, should not please her; seeing
that in a time, when as she knew thee not but by thy good aspect, she judged
thee worthy of her care; but to clear my thoughts unto thee, and to dissipate
the fear that masters thee, know, that I am resolved to place thee in our
illustrious alliance, by making thee mary Asteria; and to leave thee yet a more
precious gage, receive the word which now I give thee, (thou know, being what
I am, that it is inviolable and sacred) remember then, that I swear to thee by
ALLA, that as long as Soliman shall be living, thou shall not die a violent
death; judge now whether I can do more, and whether thou have not been too
blame to doubt of the firmness of my affection. It is true, my Lord, said
Ibrahim, that I am the most ungrateful, and the most faulty of all men; but,
my Lord, -- and as he would have proceeded, he was suffocated in such sort with
grief, as it was impossible for him to speak in a long time, The Sultan,
surprised with this unexpected emotion, knew not whereunto to attribute the
cause of it. In the mean while Ibrahim, being somewhat come to himself again,
resolved no longer to conceal the truth of his History; casting himself then
once again at the feet of great Soliman: I know well, my Lord, said he unto
him, that if thy Highness be just, thou will hate me as much as thou have loved
me; for after I have been so daring, as to disguise my thoughts unto thee;
after I have been yet more in now telling thee that I am not in a condition to
accept of the honor which thou presentest unto me, I dare not hope for so much
patience from thy moderation, as to hear that, which might render me excusable.
It seems to me, Ibrahim, ansvvered the Sulttn, that after all the graces
which I have conferred on thee, thou ought to expect any thing from me, and
yet to add one more to that which thou have craved of me, I promise thee to
suspend my judgment, and not to think any thing to thy disadvantage, till I am
forced thereunto by thine own confession; prepare thy self then no longer to
conceal any thing from me, that concerns thee: Thou know that I have diverse
times endeavored to oblige thee, punctually to recount unto me, both thy
birth, and thy adventures; but having always observed how that discourse did
not please thee, I have had so much goodness, as to speak to thee no further of
it; but now that there is question of thy rest, and my satisfaction, thou must
make a recital to me of it with as much truth, as thou have used dissimulation
heretofore. It is true, my Lord, replied Ibrahim, that all that I have told
thee hitherto is but a fable; but it is true also, that all that which thy
Highness is now to understand is the very truth: I cannot choose but blush to
think, how I am going to discover all my weaknesses; and if I did not know,
that Love does oftentimes become the tyrant of the greatest spirits, and that
thy Highness has not been always insensible of that passion, I should not be
so inconsiderate, as to acquaint thee with my miseries. The Sultan, desiring
that none should come to interrupt this narration, went from his chamber into
his Cabinet, where siting down on Cushions of cloth of Gold, Ibrahim began to
speak in these terms.

The History of Iustiniano and Isabella.
THe City, where I took beginning, and that gives name to our Republique, is
situated on the bank of the Sea, which the ancient Romans called Ligustique,
and is at this day termed the River of Genoua; this goodly City, I say,
whereunto for the magnificence of Palaces of marble, Jasper, and Porphirie, is
given, and that with reason, the title of Superb by all the people of Italy, is
built on the bending of certain high and barren Mountains, which are so
unfruitful, as all the industry of agriculture, joined to the heat of the Sun,
the serenity of the air, and the sweetness of the dew, cannot make one tree to
grow, one flower to spring, or so much as one herb to come up there. But if as
nature had taken pleasure to show contraries opposed, there is leading toward
France a Coast, all along the which, Final, Savonna, Saint Reme, and Monaco,
are seen, whose fertility is so great, that it produces abundantly Dates,
Oranges, Pomegranads, Iasemine, and Myrtle. The many Rivers, and Fountains,
which are there, make not the lest beauty of those places, for those waters are
so pure and quick, as they furnish sufficient coolness to temper the extreme
heat of the Sun. It is on that Coast, about two miles from Genoua, in going
out of a Gate called the Lanterna, that a Borough stands, by the Italians named
Arena, where one may say that winter never comes, since it is certain, that the
spring, and Autum, reign there always together; the first causing flowers
continually to spring, and the other fruits to ripen in it: But before I
engage my self to a more particular description of the deliciousness of a
place, that has been the occasion of so much misfortune unto me, it will not
be from the purpose to make an abridgment of the Government of Genoua, to thy
Highness, to the end thou may the more easily comprehend what the persons
are, of whom I am to speak in my History. It is to be known then, that about
two hundred years since the Genoneses elected a Duke, according to the manner
of the Venetians, who after he had conquered the Island of Ciprus, taken the
King and Queen thereof prisoners, and performed many other brave exploits, died
at length in the wars. After him they elected two more, whereof the first
acquired by his valor the Isle of Meteline to the Genoueses; but at length
after the death of the last they put themselves into the protection of Charles
the seventh King of France, of whom being weary, they not long after chose the
Duke of Milan for their Defendor, who having not given them full satisfaction,
it obliged them to choose a Duke once again; but that proceeding being not
equally agreeable unto all, because some held the party of France, and others
that of Milan, it happened that this disorder returned them absolutely under the
Dominion of the French, which commanded them, until the time that Andrea
Doria, who is of one of the most illustrious races of Genoua, put our City into
the estate which now it is, namely under the Government of the Nobility. I have
made known unto thy Highness the diverse mutations which have befallen our
Republique, to the end thou may with the less difficulty comprehend that,
which has made all this Commonalty be divived a long while since into two
principal factions; the Heads of these two parties are the Fregozes, and the
Adornes, engaged, as well as all the rest of Italy, in two opposite factions,
so known and famous under the name of the Gnelphes, and Gibelius, with whom the
Fiesques, the Doriaes, the Spinolaes, the Grimaldies, the Justinianoes, and all
the other illustrious Families of Genoua have taken part. But to come to that
which regards me directly, I will not fear to tell thy Highness what my birth
is, being confident of thy generosity: Thou may be pleased to understand
then, that I am of the illustrious race of that unfortunate prince, from whom
the valor and fortune of Mahomet the second, thy great Grandfather, took his
Empire, and his life, and who interred himself with all his glory, and with all
that of the Paleologues under the ruins of this famous City of Constantinople:
Thou art not ignorant, my Lord, that after so great a subversion of that State,
and in so general a destruction, all that remained of the Princes of the
Imperial House were dispersed over all the earth, and not able to conceal
their unhappiness in general, some of them concealed themselves by changing a
too famous name for their present fortune; Justiniano Paleologue, of whom I
descended, was of that number; for seeing he had saved out of that shipwreck
wealth enough for a particular, but not enough for a Prince of so illustrious a
blood as his, he retired to Genoua, retaining but the name of Justiniano, which
since has been the surname of our House, the very same with that of a Popular
Family, which was before in the same City: And that poor Prince desiring to
accommodate his quality to his misfortune, shut up that secret within his
Family, and in this sort, though we be in effect Princes, yet have we past ever
since for Gentlemen. That which obliged him to choose Genoua for his retreat,
rather than any other place of Italy, was, for that he knew how the Genoueses
had always been well affected to that Empire; how they had mightily succored
Michaelo Paleologue; and how in case it should happen that he should be known
for that which he was, he should be in a place of safety: And truly he had
some reason to fear it, for he had rendered himself so remarkable by the gallant
actions which he had performed, and had so signalized himself on the day of
the taking of Constantinople, as he was the last that was seen to defend the
breach; but at length beholding the City taken, the Emperor Constantino
Paleologue dead, and the whole Empire subverted, he stole away his person from
the victory of his Enemies; and being retired almost alone he took the
resolution which I have delivered. I know very well, my Lord, that it is too
much temeritie, in the estate wherein things are, for me to let thee
understand, that I am of a blood, which gives me some right to pretend to the
Empire that thou possessest at this present; but, my Lord, I am to tell thee,
that in the disposition wherein I am for thy Highness, I would prefer my former
chains before the Empire of my Ancestors; and that if I were the distributer
of Crowns, I would set them all upon thy head, reserving nothing for my self,
but the only glory to obey thee. Soliman, not able to endure that a discourse
so generous should continue longer without an answer, took Justinianoes hand,
and wringing it with a great deal of affection; I have always indeed believed,
said he unto him, that thy birth was as high as thy mind, and I am glad that I
have not been deceived in my conjecture; and without knowing the right which
thou could pretend to this Empire, I have at least rendered thee all the
justice that I could render thee; for I protest unto thee by all that is most
holy, and most sacred unto me, that if the convenience of things would permit
me to yield thee up the title, as well as I have given thee the power of it, I
would do it with joy, out of the knowledge which I have of thy virtues, and out
of the affection I bear thee. But continue, I pray thee, the relation of thy
adventures unto me. Ibrahim would fain have answered to these civilities of
Soliman, but being kept from doing so by him, he proceeded in this manner. That
last of the Paleologues, and that first of the Justinianoes, had a son,
called Philippo, who retaining something of his birth, had an imperious spirit,
that would give place to no man; this Philippo Justiniano, my great great
Grandfather, finding himself always opposed to one Astolpho Grimaldi; the one
having ever followed the party of the Fregozes, and the other that of the
Adornes; it was his hap also to be a pretendant to the Charge of the
Generalissimo, as well as he, so that their secret intentions breaking forth in
this occasion, they fell to quarrelling so outragiously, that they engaged all
their kindred, and all their friends in their interests; and as their ambition
was extreme, so also was their violence: But without amusing my self in
recounting this troublesome History to thy Highness, it shall suffice me to
say, that following the detestable custom, which is observed over all Italy,
that particular and persosonall hatred passed even to my father, who yet could
never approve of that habit in his heart, that will have one receive with his
life, the hatred of his Predecessors enemies, which being just for them,
becomes unjust in their children, since it is addressed to innocence; but at
length to follow the custom, rather ^han his inclination, Ludovico Justiniano
(so was he called that gave me being) had never any commerce with Rhodolpho
Grimaldi, the chief of that other Family; contrarily knowing that his enemy was
of an haughty humor, and that he might draw some advantage from his goodness, he
always took care to conceal it from him, and both on the one, and the other
part, they did all that an irreconcilable enmity could suggest to two
vindicative and powerful men. Behold, my Lord, the order wherein I found
things at my coming into the World; but without speaking of my infancy to thy
Greatness, I will only say, that as soon as I had attained the age, wherein
strength began to permit me to travel, I obtained of my father the means to
content the extreme desire I always had of going to admire the pompous ruins
of the ancient Rome, and the grandeurs of the new; away I went then with an
Equipage answerable to my condition; but my curiosity not being limited by the
view of one only City, I resolved to give no obedience to the commandment which
I had received to return unto Genoua with in six months after my departure;
and as if fortune had taken pleasure to favor my design and inclination, she
wrought so, that the Emperor of the Christians came to Lucca, where I then
being for to see the interview of the Pope, and that Prince, I understood that
preparation was making for the War of Algier; I will not fear, my Lord, to
confess unto thy Highness how joyful I was to meet with an occasion, whereby I
might learn a trade, which I was resolved to exercise all my life; I will
therefore acknowledge freely, knowing thy generosity, that he, who would now
spend all his blood for thy service, was thine enemy in that action. This
resolution taken, I had not much ado to execute it; for whereas Andrea Doria,
Prince of Melphi, was powerful with the Emperor Charles, he did me the honor
to make me known unto him, and promised me to write unto my father, for to get
him to be pleased with my design; the care that he took thereof was not in
vain, for as soon as he was advertised of it, being good and generous, he
furnished me with means to perform that voyage with magnificence. I will not
tell thee the lamentable success of that War, because the tempest which
shipwrackt our Army, was not of so small importance, but that it may be
imprinted in thy memory; the loss of two hundred vessels, and above fifteen
thousand men, that were all swallowed up of the waves, or dashed in pieces
against the Rocks, was so dreadful an adventure, as the only remembrance of it
strikes horror into me: At length, my Lord, I escaped that danger, after I had
an hundred times seen death, for which I have been very sorry I know not how
often since; but whereas we had scarce any leisure to have other enemies to
fight with than the winds and the seas, I could not resolve to return to Genoua
before I had found some opportunity, that might make me known, whether I was
worthy to carry the name of the Justinianoes; so that the relicts of our Army
parting from Bugia, where they had sought for a shelter, I would not follow
them that were discharged; contrarily I imbarqued my self with the Emperor of
the Christians, who took the way of Majorica, and from thence went and landed
at Carthagena. But hardly was he arrived there, when as he saw himself
constrained wholly to quit all his designs of Africa for to think of defending
himself from the French. It would be unjust to abuse thy patience with the
recital of a War which no way servs to my discourse, it will suffice then that
I say, how I followed him three whole years together, except when he was at
Genoua, whither I would not go for fear of being retained by my parents. But at
last, after I had been a witness of all the brave actions which he performed in
Navarre, in Germany, in Luxemburg against the Duke of Cleves, and in
Guelderland, I received express order from my father to come home to him,
which I presently did, though the Emperor was loath to let me go. But, my Lord,
what cause of misfortune has that return been unto me? Ah! how much better had
it been for me that I had dyed in the Wars, than to have gone to a place where
so many grievous adventures were to befall me? It was not, for that I was not
received with joy, caressed by my kindred, embraced by my friends with all
kindness, and if I dare say it, regarded by the enemies of our house with more
esteem, than that inveterate hatred, which had been long between us, would
permit; but contrariwise it seemed, that the Fates had resolved to let me taste
all the content of a quiet and delicious life, for to make me feel at once,
both the privation of the good, and also the evil which was prepared for me.
After I had then bestowed some time in receiving the caresses of our family,
and that I had answered all the questions which my father made me touching the
War, and my Voyages; after, I say, I had recounted unto him an hundred times
over all the occasions wherein I had been present, I desired to make it appear,
that War and Gallantry were not incompatible, and that after having been three
years in slaughter and blood, I was not returned from thence, nor more wild, or
more uncivil; I took care then to inform my self from my friends, whether
there were not some Assembly shortly to be, where I might make comparison
betvveen the Beauties of our Ladies, and those which I had seen in Spain?
Thereunto they answered me, that I might in a little time content my curiosity,
for that in three or four days the Nuptials of two persons of quality in our
City would be solemnized. I further demanded of them whether a Niepce of Andrea
Doriaes held not still the Empire of beauty? Or whether since my departure some
other had not bereaved her of that advantage, which had been given her with so
much justice? They told me, that she was fair, as I had seen her, but as for
the prime place, she had been constrained to yield it up to a springing beauty,
which made all that came near it to die for love; and that they accounted me
most happy for not being exposed to that danger. But when as I demanded of them
by what false consequence they conjectured that I was insensible of love? they
answered me then, that Isabella Grimaldi, the only daughter of Rhodolpho, was
that same admirable person, who could not be sufficiently praised, and of whom
they had spoken unto me; and that knowing the terms wherein we stood, they
believed that I was so generous, as I would not suffer my self to be vanquished
by mine enemy. This discourse stirred up such an emotion within me, as has
made me to understand since, that there is a supreme power which forces us,
whether we will or no, and without the aid of our knowledge, oftentimes to love
a person whom common reason forbids us to regard. And consider, my Lord, the
extravagancy of my adventure, I took a resolution then carefully to seek out
all occasions to see the incomparable Isabella; and to show that there was
already something extraordinary in this motion, I concealed my curiosity, and
my design from my friends, and I made a secret and a mystery of a matter,
wherein according to all likelihood there would never be any; and indeed soon
after I quitted them, and without further delay I went and passed two or three
times before the windows of mine enemy. It was not because I knew not well
enough that I should not see her; for it is the custom of Italy, as well as of
Constantinople, that all the windows of the Ladies have an iron-grate before
them, which permits them to see, but suffers them not to be seen, unless they
will dravv up the grate, which is a grace they seldom show, and was not to be
expected of me; howsoever I went thither, because I could do no otherwise. The
next morning I failed not to be more diligent than I was wont, and I did all
that possibly I could to encounter her, for knowing her mother, I was certain
that I should have no need to ask her name; but whether it were, that whilst I
was in one place, she was in another, or that fortune would defer my
captivity, I could not meet with her any where, how careful soever I was to
do it. I demanded of my reason an hundred times over, what aim I had in this
design; but after I had reflected on this unquietness, I condemned my self, and
resolved patiently to attend the hap of incountring her, who was to content
my curiosity. I past some days then after this manner in all the
entertainments of a man of my age and quality; the conversation of my friends,
vvalks, and music were my occupations, and the last quiet pleasures that I
have tasted in my life. But, my Lord, since I must recount my undoing to thy
Greatness, and let thee see the field of my defeat. I must say then, that
Arena, whereof I have already spoken, is a Borough where all the persons of
eminent condition have houses of pleasure, the least whereof may strike
admiration into them that understand gallant things; for all that is beautiful
in Architecture, all that is excellent in Painting, and all that is marvailous
in Sculpture, are there to be seen in such perfection, as neithe^ the eye nor
the wit of the most skillful can find any thing to reprehend therein. The
Terraces, the Grots, the Water-vvorks, the Galleries, and Balustrades, a^e
there so superb, as one can hardly believe the first time that one beholds such
wonders, but that they are of those inchantad Palaces, whose descriptions,
though fabulous, leave not for all that to please our imagination. To conclude,
all that Art, and Magnificence can add to a place, whereunto Nature has
given all her beauties, are eminently found in this same. It is here so near
unto the City, vvhither all the women of quality use to go and walk; their
liberty being far greater at Genoua, than in all the rest of Italy, the
neighborhood of France having contributed a part of their customs to it. It
happened then one day, that one of my dearest friends entreated me to go and hear
a consort of Lutes and Voices, vvh^ch was to be the next day at an house he
had in that delicious abode; and whereas I have alvvaies been touched very
sensibly with Music, I failed not to be there accordingly: it is certain
nevertheless, that I came thither with a secret melancholy, which doubtless
advertised me of the misfortune that was to betide me there; but I was not
able to make any profit by this involuntary motion, whereof the cause was
unknown to me; I suffered my self notvvithstanding to be charmed with the
svveetness of the harmony, and as it was at that time the only passion that
mastered my mi^d, me thought it had dissipated my heaviness, and rouzed up my
joy; this agreeable transport was the last moment that preceded my ruin: For,
my Lord, when as the Sun was so low, as it could no longer incommodate either
with his rays, or with his heat, the Master of the house told me, that before I
went down into the Garden, he would let me hear a mavelous Echo, which he
had found out a little before, and which one of his neighbors had given him
without thinking of it; how he had done him that good office, by causing a
Grot to be made just against the windows of his Cabinet, and hollowed in the
mountain in the form of a half Moon, which collected, and returned back the
voice so admirably, that the seventh repetition which the Echo made, was
distinguished perfectly. Scarcely was this discourse ended, but that devancing
all the company I entered alone into the Cabinet, resolving to try the Echo
first of all; howbeit, my Lord, I had no sooner opened the windovv, but instead
of obliging the Echo to answer me, I my self lost the use of my voice, by the
rapture vvherewithall I was seized, in beholding the fairest creature that ever
Nature made; she was leaning on a Balustrade of Jasper and Porphirie, which
formed a Quadrant, in the midst whereof stood a Fountain, wherein four Nymphs
of white Marble seemed to play together in bathing themselves; for by a
mavelous artifice there parted from their hands in different actions, an
abundance of water, which wetted them, and made one believe that they cast it
upon one another, making withal a very pleasing noise. If I had never seen
this Fountain but in this encounter, I should not have heeded it so much, as to
be able to describe it; for I was so surprised with the charms of this
unknown fair one, as I had no eyes but for her: I changed color twenty times
in a moment, and hiding my self for fear of being perceived, I considered her
with all the attention that a man could have, who from admiration was already
passed even to love; it being most certain, that from the very first instant I
savv her, I felt my self forced with so much violence to love her, as I then
fully resolved to dye, or to possess her. As I was in this estate all the
company arrived, and showed me that they were sorry I had quitted them so soon,
because there had been a dispute about the nature of the Echo, which would
have pleased me very much; after I had heard this discourse, without answering
unto it, I asked whether there were any that could tell me the name of that
fair one, who sat musing on the brim of the fountain, which I saw in the midst
of the Garden; in saying so, I softly opened the window, which I had half shut,
and praying them to make no noise, I showed them that prodigy of beauty: I had
no sooner made an end of speaking, but by an hidden knowledge, which prevented
their answer, I felt something within me, that told me how it was the divine
Isabella; scarcely had this thought excited some trouble in my mind, when as
one of my friends confirmed this truth unto me, and demanded of me, if it was
possible that I should not know mine enemy? Why, said I, interrupting him, is
she that I see, the daughter of Rhodolpho? I spoke this so loud, that I made
her turn her face toward the place where we were, so that having perceived us
she pulled down her veil, and began to go away unto two women that were walkieg
in an Alley a good way off. To tell, my Lord, what became of me in this
occasion, would be a difficult matter; my reason proved so weak, and my passion
so strong, as little wanted, but that forgetting all kind of good manners, I
had at the very instant departed from a place that had been so fatal unto me,
as to let me see in one only person the object of my hate, and of my love: But
at length, the spite and the shame of being seen with so much weakness, made
me resolve to try to conreal it; I said then to him that had spoken to me, that
I was ravished with having so fair an Enemy, and that though she had arms which
would easily render her victorious of all them that she would subject, yet was
I generous enough, for to combat a person by whom one might be vanquished
without shame. After this they amused themselves in seeking out the beauties of
the Echo; those of the company who had the worst and the hoarsest voices,
forbore not forcing this Echo to reproach them with their defect, in imitating
them: As for me, who had it not unpleasing at that time, it was impossible for
me to sing, and howsoever I constrained my self, I could not call to mind so
much as one air, albeit I knew many. This entertainment lasted so long, that at
length, the hour of our departure being arrived, I returned to Genoua, but so
sad and melancholic, that to conceal my unquietness from my Father, I resolved
not to see him all that evening: I retired then to my chamber as soon as I was
come home, and gave my people order to say, that finding my self somewhat ill I
was gone to bed, having first expressly charged them to make no noise: After
this I went into my Cabinet, where I was no sooner alone, but the pourtrait
of Isabella presented it self again before mine eyes; my imagination figured
her so perfectly unto me, as I began to believe, that this adorable Phantasi^
appeared to me by the force of some charms; but after I knevv that it was a
pure effect of my memory, and of my love, I past from that thought to another,
and regarding her no more as my Mistress, I considered her as the daughter of
Rhodolpho; What, said I, to my self, shall I love mine enemy? Shall I choose
for the object of my affection, her, who ought to be the object of my hatred?
Shall I be so unworthy as to give all my services and my cares to a person,
whose father imployes all his for the ruin of my house? No, no, I am more
sensible of mine honor, than of my passion; and how charming soever Isabella
is, glory is yet more When this resolution seemed to me to be well enough
settled in my mind, I called a Groom of my chamber, whom I had stayed to attend
me, and letting my self to be made unready, without knowing what I did, I laid
me down in my bed; but alas! it was in vain that I sought for rest there, for
whereas my thoughts were divided all the day by the diversity of objects,
silence and obscurity made them amass all their forces to persecute me; and the
same reason that had opposed my love, began to speak in favor of my passion:
It represented unto me, that Isabella was not guilty of her Fathers crimes;
that there was injustice and cruelty in going about to eternize hatred; that a
more noble occasion to make it cea^e could never present it self; that my
design would be always approved of by wise men; that after all it concerned my
content, and not that of others; that we live not for another, but for
ourselves, and that by consequence I was not to forget any thing that might
give me satisfaction. This reasoning seemed so just unto me, that I spent the
rest of the night in thinking on the means to execute it; but the more I
considered this enterprise, the more I judged it impossible; the arrogant
humor of Rhodolpho, and the generosity of my father, seemed two obstacles very
difficult to be forced; but that which put me into further despair, was the
thought that Isabella her self would be inflexible to my Love: For, said I, is
it possible, that a maid, who has been brought up with the hate of the
Justinianoes, who no sooner opened her eyes, but she beheld my house as her
enemy, can resolve, I do not say, to love, but only to endure that I should
adore her. These diverse agitations troubled me in such sort, as I could not
form any design; but whereas love cannot subsist without hope, I think that in
the end I had surmounted my passion, and broken my chains, if that fatality
which will have me ruined, had no exposed me once again to a new danger. I was
scarcely out of my bed, when as my people told me, that I was invited to the
Wedding of one of my Fathers ^riends, who was to be married to a maid all^^d to
Isabella; this news filled me with extreme joy, and preparing to go thither, I
took more care of my self, than ever I had done in all my life before: But
being resolved to see the arrival of mine enemy, I got me in good time to the
place appointed for the Ball; I was no longer there than to make the
complements, which are usual in such like occasions, whenas I saw Isabella
enter with such a dazeling Majesty, as imposed silence to all the company, and
it seemed that she had inspired every one with modesty and respect. After that
this dumb admiration had continued a while, there was a confused noise heard of
acclamations and praises, which were given to her beauty; and the truth is,
that envy it self could not find any thing in her to be amended. She has a
stature so advantageous, and a port so majesticall, as never was there woman
seen of a better presence. Her hair is of color brown, but so beautiful, as
all those threads of burnished gold, wherewith our Poets use to describe such,
cannot represent them; they fell that day carelessly upon her cheeks, and thence
descended in thick curls down her neck and bosom, but with a negligence so
replenished with address, that it defaced the handsomest curiosity of all the
women of the Assembly. She has a complexion so white and vive, as there is no
whiteness that seems not sallow unto it; but the same is mingled with so dainty
a Carnation, which i^ shed abroad in her cheeks, that the mixture of Lillies
and Roses, of Oynoper and Snow, could make but a slight Idea of her beauty. Her
eyes are black, but so full of spirit and sweetness, as it is impossible to
behold her, and not be taken with them; yet are her looks so modest, and so far
from all artifice, as it is very easy to know that they are innocent of all
the evils which they make one endure. She has a mouth neither too great nor
too little, but so composed, and of so Vermilion a hew, as there is no corrall
that comes near it. Her teeth are so evenly set, and so white, as never were
smiles so full of charms as hers; and her bosom so delicate and so comely, as
imagination cannot represent it to it self such as it is: There is also a
gracefulness mingled amongst all these marvells, which cannot be expressed, and
which renders her more amiable than all that which I have delivered. To
conclude, be it for the whole form of the face, or for all the features of it
in particular, or for the air in general, it is the most perfect beauty that
ever Nature produced. But, my Lord, had the soldiers that took me, left me the
picture which I had of her, and the Letters which she had written to me, I
could have made thy Highness see the truth of my words, and that the graces of
her mind do no whit give place to those of her beauty: It was then, my Lord,
that Isabella with all those allurements, appeared in that Assembly. She was
apparelled in a Gown of Carnation Satin, imbroidered with gold and pearls,
whereof the sleeves were buttoned up with great Diamonds; the rest of her habit
was of cloth of silver, imbroidered with Pearls and Emeraulds intermixed. She
appeared so charming unto me in this estate, as I could not for all that
evening take mine eyes from off her; and as I carefully observed her, me
thought she perceived that I did not behold her as an enemy, and to render my
joy yet more accomplished, I marked how she blushed every time that we met
together in the same Brawl, but in a fashion which persuaded me, that it was
neither for hate, nor for anger. And whereas it is the custom of Genoua not to
converse with the women of an Assembly, but in leading them to dance, I took
out one of my kinswomen, whom I had seen all the evening with Isabella, and
that I might oblige her to speak to me of her, I said unto her, that I found it
very strange she should hold such intelligence with mine enemy; but without
giving me leave to finish my speech, she answered me that the talk they had
together was so advantageous for me, as I had no reason to complain of it; and
that as the praises which are given us by our enemies, are more glorious for
us, than others, because they cannot be suspected of flattery, I was no longer
to doubt of my good me^n and address, since Isabella her self had judged of it
in favor of me, upon speaking of the grace and dancing of every man of the
Company. This discourse ravished me in such sort, as I could not forbear
looking on Isabella, as if I would thank her for so favorable a judgment; and
as she has a quick and piercing wit, she knew both by my demeanor and joy,
that my kinswoman had given me an account of their talk, which possessed her with
so much confusion, as it was impossible for me all the rest of the evening to
encounter her eyes. At length, my Lord, the company being separated, I returned
home, but so full of joy and hope, that my reason found not it self any longer
strong enough to oppose my passion. But not to stand on the recital of these
first proceedings of my affection, wherewith I have already but too much
importuned thy Highness, it will suffice to let thee understand, that in the
continuance of this happiness I saw Isabella in two or three Assemblies more,
from whence I always went still better satisfied; and after I had been so
hardy, as to write diverse times unto her, and ready enough to find the means
to do it, I knew at length that my vows were not rejected, and that my
temeritie should not be punished. I obtained then the permission to serve her,
provided I were discreet, and that neither by my actions, nor by my discourse,
I should give any cause of suspecting our intelligence: I observed this order
so religiously, that albeit there passed not a day wherein I saw her not at her
window, or an evening wherein I had not a Letter from her, or she from me, yet
was no body ever aware of our commerce. And to render my good fortune more
accomplished, it happened that the people being fallen into a mutiny in the Isle
of Corsica for some Contribution that should have been established here, the
Signioria deputed Rhodolpho for to go and appease that disorder; but whereas
his wife, named Julia, had been extreme sick, he would have her for the
recovery of her strength to pass the time of his absence at the Borrough of
Arena, where the purity of the air would restore her to her health sooner than
at Genoua. I was advertised of this resolution the very same day that it was
taken; but at first this news so grieved me, that I could not answer Isabella,
who had sent it to me, for I imagined that I should be deprived of all the
means of seeing, and of being seen of her: As I was profoundly musing on this
adventure, all on a sudden I began to call to mind the window of the Cabinet
where I had lost my liberty, which made me think, that if Isabella would permit
me to discover one part of my design to the Master of that house, who, as I
have already said, was the dearest of my friends, I should be the happiest of
all men, since I might not only see, and be seen, but talk with her as long as
she pleased. I wrote instantly unto her then to propound her my design, but
with terms so full of love, and with such strong reasons for the prevention of
all might happen to us thereby, as at length she consented unto it, though, as
she told me afterward, it was not without much repugnancy. I no sooner
received her answer, but I went to seek out my friend, of whom I desired leave
to go and pass some time at that house of his; but whereas he pressed me to
tell him, whether his presence would not be nec^ssary for me there, I believed,
that for the obliging of him to be faithful and secret, I was to confide in
his discretion and fidelity; wherefore I acquainted him that I desired his
house, only to receive Isabellaes Letters by the Cabinet-window, which opened
toward the Grot of the Echo, and that in the same place I hoped to see and
speak with her. He was so surprised with this discourse, that he stood a good
while beholding me without making any answer; but to keep him from
endeavoring to oppose my passion, I entreated him to give no ear to any reason
that could speak to him against me, but to hearken to my request; and seeing
that it was by his means that I was undone, he was obliged to have pity of
the evil which he had caused; I likewise recounted unto him all that had
befallen me, so that judging by the violence vvherevvith I spoke to him, that I
was too far engaged in this design to be diverted from it, he promised to
yield a blind obedience to all that I would desire of him. In this sort we
parted, and albeit Isabella had not permitted me to make use of the Cabinet,
but only to give her Letters, to receive hers, and to speak to her at such
times as we could not be heard, yet I purposed not to rest there, and without
advertising her of it, I caused a ladder of silk to be made, that thereby I
might descend into the garden when I thought fit, being out of hope of ever
meeting with a more favorable occasion to talk with her of my love. But not
to lose time, as soon as I knevv that Rhodolpho was departed, and that
Isabella was at Arena with her mother, I resolved to go thither the same
evening; now to do that secretly, I told my Father, that having made a match
with Caesar Doria, (for so was that friend of mine called) we intended to go
and pass away some time at an house which he had near to Gani, to hunt the wild
Bore, and to enjoy all the delights that the fields and solitude could give us.
He approved of my resolution, told me that the season was too fair to be passed
wholly in the City, and permitted me to go away that very day; I went then and
found out Doria, who for his part had taken care to make the same thing to be
believed; and having but one Groom of the chamber with us, we took the way of
Gaui, but as soon as we were out of the sight of Genoua, we crossed the
Mountain to get to Arena, where, notwithstanding all the have we could make, we
did not arrive till ten of the clock at night; for whereas we kept no way, we
strayed three or four times. A^ soon as I was come into Doria's house, and that
he had commanded the Keeper thereof to silence, I left him in his garden, for
to go with much impatience to his Cabinet, where I no sooner was, but I heard
the voice of Isabella, who indeed imagining that I would not fail to be at the
window, had for a pretext to get thither, and be alone there, taken a Lute,
saying that she would at leisure study an air, which she had not very
perfect, therevvith to divert her Mothers melancholy. She was then leaning on
the same Ballustrade, where I had seen her before; but if at the first time
she charmed me by the eyes, at the second she charmed me by the ears; I was so
ravished to hear her, that notvvithstanding the desire I had to speak to her,
yet would I not interrupt her, though I infinitely feared lest she should be
called away before I had been seen of her; but in the end the fruition of a
present pleasure prevailed over the fear of an uncertain evil. I heard her
then with all the admiration I was capable of: For, my Lord, she has a voice
so strong, so clear, so sweet, and so charming, as she inspires the minds of
those that hear her, with the same passions which she expresses by the airs
she sings; and whereas night and silence are the friends of Music, there
rested nothing more to make my contentment perfect, than to add to the delight
of hearing, that of seeing distinctly: I was not l^ng without enjoying that
happiness, for the Moon, which had been a pretty while up before, made an end
of dissipating of the shadow that had reigned all over the Garden, and in
rendering me that good office, she made me also to be perceived of her, so that
she presently gave over singing, and approached to the place where I was, but
with so much circumspection, and so much fear, as made me greatly to pity her.
She prayed me with a trembling voice to give her a Letter if I had any, and
that the next day, if I would let her down a string, she would fasten her
answer to it. After I had labored to assure her as much as possibly I could,
she made me to understand, that we could not have any long conversation in that
same place without being discovered, because if we spoke softly it would be
unprofitable unto us, not being able to hear one another; and if we raised our
voices, it were to be feared that we should be overheard from a close ally
that was not far off. I consented then to be contented with seeing her, and
receiving her Letters by the way she had propounded unto me; but whereas I had
my design concealed, I besought her to tell me in what part her lodging was, to
the end I might at leastwise have the pleasure to imagine to my self the place
where she would be writing. But before she answered me, she looked round about,
to observe whether she might not be overheard; after which she demanded of me,
if I did not see on my left hand a Turret athwart the trees, which was joining
to the end of a Gallery, that made up one front of the Garden, and that
answered to another altogether like unto it? and having told her that I saw it,
she added that her chamber was of an even floor with that same place; and that
the perron of it was just against the end of the close alley, from whence she
feared to be overheard; and that if I would advance forth my head a little, I
might see the grate of her vvindow. As soon as she had said this, she went
away, having first assured me, that such evenings as she could not come her
self to receive my Letters, she would send a maid to me that lay in her
chamber, in whom she absolutely confided. After she was retired, and clean out
of sight, I went presently and found out my friend, to whom I gave an account
of our conference. But, my Lord, seeing I must obey thy Greatness, in
recounting all my adventures unto thee, I must say, that after I had been three
or four days obedient to Isabellaes pleasure, one evening she sent me that
maid which she made use of, with a Letter, desiring me to excuse her if she
came not her self; for that being somewhat ill in the morning, she could not
invent a pretext to obtain permission to come into the Garden according to her
custom. This news grieved me exceedingly, and so thoroughly confirmed me in my
design, that to execute it, I enquired whether Isabella were retired to her
chamber? The maid told me, that she had left her at her windovv, staying till
she returned, which she was instantly to do, because the doors would suddenly
be shut, for the keys were to be carried to her mother, who had commanded that
to be exactly observed. I threw her down my Letter then, and having dismissed
her, I went and desired Doria to ass^st me in the resolution I had taken to
descend into the Garden. He did all that he could to hinder me from it, but
after I had told him, that I exposed my self to no danger, seeing that Rodolpho
was not there, that Julia was sick, and that in conclusion, I should enter
into an house where there were none but sleeping Women, the rest of the train
being at Genoua, or gone with Rhodolpho; I ent^^ated him that he would only
attend for me at the vvindow, to the end that if by ill fortune I were seen, I
might save my self before they had time to open the door for to follow me. Our
contestation lasted long enough to persuade me that it was shut, but yet I
believed that Isabella was not gone to bed, and that my Letter would entertain
her until such time as I should come unto her, because by good hap it was very
long. So I began to fasten my Ladder, and Doria, more vanquished by my
entreaties, than by my reasons, set himself also to help me; and whereas I
feared nothing in this enterprise but Isabellaes displeasure, I never thought
of mine own safety, howbeit Doria made me take a brace of Pistols, and my
sword with me, whereupon I descended into the Garden, and calling to mind that
the close alley was corresponding to Isabellaes lodging, I went along through
it, for fear of being perceived, either from the Gallery, or the mothers
chamber; when I was arrived at the end of the alley, I observed that there was
no light in all that Turret, but in one window that had a grate, which I
imagined to be Isabellaes Cabinet; I approached thereunto then as softly as
possibly I could, and whereas the vvindow was low, I might easily see all that
was done in the room through the glass, so that I perceived Isabella, but with
so much grace in the negligence wherein I saw her, as I knew well, that art
added nothing to her beauty. She was leaning on her left elbow upon a little
table, where my letter lying open before her, she had her eyes fixed on it,
whilst Feliciana (so was the maid that served her called) undoing of a string
that tied up her headgeer, covered her almost all over with her hair; but
Isabella, coming as it were out of a dead sleep, and putting it aside with her
hands, told her she would not go to bed yet, for that she was resolved to write
unto me first. It were better, said I unto her, pushing the casement that was
not shut, that you would grant me the honor to entertain you a while. She was
so surprised with seeing me in that place, as she could not forbear screeking
out, whereupon she would have passed into her chamber, but not able to op^n the
door thereof so quickly, I had leisure to tell her, that if she put me into
despair, I was apt enough to kill my self before her window: She fell down then
upon the cushions not able to speak, which gave me time to crave pardon of her
for my boldness; I besought her to remember the discretion I had always used
since the day she had permitted me to serve her; that this was the only
disorder whereunto my passion had carried me; and that if she would take the
pains to consider it, she would not judge this fault irremissible. Do you
believe then, said she, in approaching to the window, that to put my glory and
your life in hazard is a crime of small importance? But at length, after I had
made her to comprehend, that there was less danger in speaking with her, when
all the World was retired, than at such time as she of her goodness had
granted me, I got her to consent, that from thence forward I should always see
her in that sort. Our conference was so long, as the awaking of the birds made
me know, that it was time to let her go to sleep; but before I left her she
gave me her picture, which she had drawn in imitature, by beholding her self in
a glass; for this divine person is skillful in all excellent Arts and Sciences:
She also permitted me to kiss her through the grate, a favor which I may well
say, was the only privacy that ever she accorded me during all the nights
which I have past in entertaining of her. I vvithdrew then by the same way I
came, but so satisfied with the wit of Isabella, that I began to love her more
for her virtue, than for her beauty. I found my friend in an extreme impatience
for my return, and ready to come and seek me out for to know whether any
misfortune had befallen me; but to recompense him for this pain, I recounted
unto him all that Isabella had the most obligingly said unto me; the vovvs she
had made to love me everlastingly, and absolutely to renounce the world rather
than be any others than mine; and that whereas I would have persuaded her to
suffer her self to be carried away for the avoiding of our fathers tyranny, who
would be forced to agree together rather than lose us, she had withstood it
with so much prudence and sweetness, as I was constrained to confess, how
strong soever my passion was, I could not merit Isabella. It was in this manner
then, my Lord, that I past away that lucky absence of Rhodolpho; but at length
his return changed the order of things, and Isabella went back to Genoua with
her mother, as melancholic, as I was afflicted; we had been so accustomed to
see and speak to one another, that the privation thereof was insupportable to
us; and although I went every morning to receive a Letter at her vvindow, and
to give her one of mine; yet could we not comfort our selves against the
constraint wherein we lived. And as if it were not enough that we were
persecuted by our own misfortune, Isabella saw her self also troubled for a
mishap of her fathers, who in executing the Commission which he had to go into
Corsica, had procured unto himself the enmity of the family of the Spinolaes,
by saying at his return, that the Governor, who was of that house, had
contributed in some sort to the mutiny of the people, and that if he would he
might have hindered the sedition that was raised there: This report obliged the
Signiora to cite the Governor to come and give an account of his action, which
made Isabella to fear that this man's revenge would fall heavy upon her father.
As for me, who had no other interest than that of the incomparable Isabella, I
was even mad for that I durst not offer my sword to Rhodolpho, who was at that
very time plotting my death; for whether it were, that he was advertised how I
went every night about his house, or that he knevv of my being at Arena by some
way unknown to me, one evening, as I was alone with my sword under Isabellaes
Window, he came thundering upon me, with eight men armed, in such fury, as I had
hardly the leisure to put my self into defense; now though it was very dark,
yet chanced I to know him, and thereupon resolved, rather to be killed, than
dip my hand in the blood of the father of Isabella: I did nothing therefore but
ward the blovvs which he laid at me; but two of his advancing toward me, I
had not for them the same respect that I had for him, so that collecting all my
forces together to oppose their violence, I extended them dead at my feet; the
rest, who saw this so sudden an execution, made a little stand, during the
which I got me to the end of a narrow street, that was not above two or three
steps from me, for fear of being enclosed, where I fought a good while without
receiving any more than two vvounds, which I got because I would not strike
Rhodolpho; but at length I should have fallen in this unequal combat, had it
not been for a succor that arrived unto me. And consider, my Lord, the
strangeness of my adventure; that which should have been the cause of my
undoing, was the cause of my making: for it happened, that at such time as I was
pressed most by mine enemies, the same offended Governor, of whom I have
already spoken to thy Highness, came, accompanied with fifteen or sixteen, and
assaulted them behind. In this disorder I never stood doubting which part I
should take, but siding my self with Rhodolpho, I said unto him, that I was
come to lose that life for him, which he would have taken from me. And whereas
I fought then for Isabella, since it was to save her father, I found my forces
redoubled, and my courage increased; whereupon being to employ my best
endeavor in the action, I attacqued the chief of the enterprise with such
ardour, as albeit he were one of the valiantest men of our age, yet by the good
fortune of arms I surmounted him. As soon as he fell, one of his followers
cried out, that his Master was slain; this voice put all that troop into such
disorder, as they thought of nothing but flying, although they were in a
condition to have destroyed us; for whilst I was engaged with their Chieftain,
they had killed three of Rodolphoes men, who in the heat of the fight had
observed how I had guarded him with mine own body, and that by my hand his
enemy lost his life. After I had pursued them that fled a good way off, for to
keep them from making head again, I saw Rhodolpho come toward me with open
arms, and as soon as he could embrace me, he demanded of me, whether after I
had been so generous as to save his life, I could be so likewise for to pardon
him; and how, if that might not be, he judged himself unworthy to live; how he
knew well enough that he had committed a barbarous and cruel fact against me,
but how I knew also that he was the father of Isabella: He said this to me with
so much resentment and tenderness, as being no longer able to keep me from
interrupting him, I assured him, that I should never be mindful of any thing
hereafter but of the goodness which he had showed me; that the grace which he
did me in promising me his friendship, was far greater than the outrage I had
received; and that on the contrary one might say, he had done an act of justice
in going about to punish my temerity; and that now he did one of clemency, in
accepting of the service which an enemy had rendered him. This while Rhodolphoes
people would have carried away their dead men, hoping that they which were in
this fight, should not be discovered, if no mark thereof were left in the
street; but Rhodolpho commanded that they should not touch them, for that he
was resolved to complain the first; and observing that I did not bear up very
well, he asked me whether I were hurt? I answered him that I thought I was, but
it was slightly, and that when I had put him into a place of safety, I would go
home and see how it was with me. No, no, my son, said he embracing me, it
would be unjust, that the father of Isabella should be the cause of your hurts,
and she not be your Surgeon. In saying this he made me enter in at his gate,
where I no sooner was, but, the loss of blood having extremely weakened me, I
swooned in his arms, whereat Rhodolpho cried out so loud, as I understood
afterward, that his wife and daughter believed his enemies were still pursuing
him into his house; they ran in then affrighted in all have: but whereas they
knew not the particularities of that which had past, they were mightily
astonished to see me in that place, and in that estate. Isabella believed at
first, that her father, having gotten some notice of our love, had brought me
thither to put me to death before her eyes, but she was mightily surprised,
when as she heard him give order for the speedy fetching of Chirurgions, and
beheld me led to his chamber, and he himself helping to sustain me. Isabella
was so skared with that she saw, as if her mother had not held her up, she had
fallen down by me. Her father seeing her in that case, said to her weeping, as
I was told afterward, you have reason, daughter, to love the most generous of
men, and if I be so unfortunate as to be the cause of his loss, I consent that
you shall hate me as much, as I have hated him; but without further lamenting,
let us endeavor to succor him. The voice of Rhodolpho having brought Isabella
to her self again, she would have made some excuse, but enjoining her to
silence he commanded her to follow him to his chamber, whither I had been
carried before. As soon as they had laid me on a bed I began to open mine eyes;
and consider, my Lord, what my apprehension might be, when I saw my self
between Rhodolpho, Jsabella, and Julia, who came to know, by one of those that
were in the action, that I had saved her husbands life, it was so great, that I
thought I should have swooned again, but the Chirurgians, being arrived,
applied remedies that kept me from it. After they had searched my wounds, they
assured them that there was no other danger in me but loss of blood, so that if
I were suffered to rest they hoped to cure me very speedily. As soon as I was
dressed, and that Rhodolpho had been acquainted with their report, he came to me
with a smiling countenance, and said, that seeing he was assured of my life, he
was not in despair of recompensing me for the service I had done him; that in
the mean time he would go and advertise my father of all that had past, to the
end that after they had embraced one another, they might conjointly think of
what they had to do. But having told him, how I held it not fit, that he
should go forth, I besought him to permit me to write two or three words to
Doria for to come to me, and that when he was come we would send him to my
father. Isabella approved this counsel, so as it might not incommodate me; and
having assured her that I found my self strong enough for it, she gave me
paper, wherein I wrote, without seeing that which I did, so weak I felt my
self, when I tried to lift up my head. But I^hodolpho, desirous exactly to
observe what the Chirurgians had enjoined, gave order to Julia and his daughter
to keep me from speaking, to draw my curtains for fear the light should annoy
me, to have as great care of me as of him, and not to leave me till I was in a
better estate. I besought him then to permit me to say one word more unto him;
whereupon he approached to me, and pressed me to give him some occasion to serve
me. I answered him, that the grace which I desired to obtain was, that he would
not speak, either to Doria, or to my father, of our first encounter, but would
be pleased to say only, that good fortune had brought me by chance into the
street where he was set upon. Rhodolpho was so ravished with this discourse, as
he could not forbear embracing me, and saying alowd, that as the conservation
of his honor was more dear unto him, than that of his life, the care I took to
deface the stain which he had made in it, obliged him more straightly, than the
blood I had shed to save his. As I would have answered, he stayed me, and went
away to give order for all that he thought was necessary, both for his safety,
and mine. And whereas Doria dwelt not far off, he came not long after into the
chamber where I was, but so surprised, and so amazed, to hear that I was
wounded, to see me in Rhodolphoes house, and to find Jsabella and Julia siting
by my beds side, that he was a long time in a doubt, whether he was well awake,
or no. Rhodolpho, having been advertised that he was arrived, came and
entertained him with so much civility, and spoke so advantagiously of me, as I
was constrained to pray him to change his discourse, and to think rather of the
necessity of our affairs, than of praising me unjustly. Doria was instructed
then in the estate of things, and of our intentions; Rhodolpho desired him to
tell my father, that he would have gone home to him, if I had not hindered him,
to crave pardon for all that had past betwixt them, and to entreat him to think
well of it, that his daughter might be the reward of the combat, which I had so
happily undertaken for his defense; how he was not ignorant, that Isabella had
been more equal than he, in esteeming of me as soon as she knew me; and that
for him he was not so ill informed of my design, but that he had been
advertised of those which I had for his daughter; in the end so to do, said he
to Doria, that the Families of the Justinianoes and the Grimaldies may be
united with an indissoluble knot: More than this I have not to say, Lodovico
knows the Nobility of my House, understands the riches of it, and cannot doubt
but that the Principality of Monaco will one day be Isabellaes. Doria promised
to employ all his address to make the matter succeed according to our desires.
Rodolpho instantly requested him, I earnestly conjured him, and Isabella with
her eyes only entreated him thereunto. He went then to my Father, who was so
surprised with every thing that Doria imparted unto him, as he diverse times
asked of him, whether he had not lost his understanding: what, said he, as I
knew afterward by Doria, in one very hour has my son saved the life of his
enemy? hazarded his own by the wounds which he has received? killed the enemy
of Rodolpho? made peace between the Justinianoes and the Grimaldies? and for a
conclusion, has Isabella and the Principality of Monaco been offered him by
Rhodolpho? No, no, Doria, all that you tell me is far from all likelihood; you
talk to me of blood, of murder, of slaughter, of reconciliation, and nuptials
all at once; how do you think that I can accord all these things, and can joy
and grief be compatible? But in the end, my Lord, that first transport being
over, Doria assured the matter so seriously unto him, as he was constrained to
make no longer doubt of it. I confess that in this encounter I was more happy
than I hoped; for as soon as my father was persuaded to this truth, Doria found
his mind in the terms that I desired. I think, my Lord, I have already told thy
Highness, how Lodovico never approved of that unjust hatred, which passes with
the succession of Kinsmen, and that was the reason why he was so easily carried
to what I wished. He came then accompanied with Doria and some of his servants;
to the house of Rhodolpho, who received him with a free and open countenance,
and with such strong protestations of acknowledgement and amity, as it was
easy to observe, that his eyes and his mouth expressed the meaning of his
heart; and as my father would have been very sorry, that his ancient enemy
should have surpassed him in courtesy and generosity, he returned his
complements with so much civility, as it would have been hard to imagine, that
those two men, who so kindly embraced one another, had been mortal enemies all
their lifetime before. Rodolpho having brought Lodovico to my bedside, said
unto him, that he was much grieved to render him his son in that estate
wherein he saw him; but to repair that misfortune, he besought him to accept of
a present that he would tender him; whereupon he caused Isabella to approach,
and presented her to my father, who beheld her with so much admiration, as I
doubted not but that he approved of the choice I had made of her; and presently
speaking he assured Rhodolpho, that though he and I had hazarded our lives a
thousand times over for his service, yet could not all that countervail the
price and merit of so fair a maid. Rhodolpho interrupting him said, that giving
himself, together with Isabella, and all his estate, yet should he be
infinitely indebted unto me, that my modesty forbad him to extend himself on
the obligations wherein he stood engaged unto me, but how that could not hinder
him from resenting them as he ought; in the mean time he requested him to
receive Isabella for his daughter-in-Law, upon such conditions as he pleased,
to the end that after he had his word for it, they might think of that which
was necessary to be done for their safety. My father turning himself then to
me, said, that he held it superfluous to ask my advice in a matter that was
so glorious for me, and that I had so happily resolved upon without him; so
that, said he, taking Isabella by the hand, it is on you that the conclusion of
this important affair does depend. But Rhodolpho seeing her blush, without
daring to answer, told Lodovico, that his daughter could no better express her
consent, than by that shamefastness, which made her to blush and be silent; the
modesty of her sex, and of her disposition not permitting her to testify her
joy, but in such a manner. Rhodolpho and my father then promised an inviolable
friendship one to another, and ordained us to do the like in their presence;
and for a gage of this promise, Lodovico, who ordinarily wore a rich ring on
his finger, took it to me for to give to Isabella, as a pledge of the faith
which we had promised to each other. I observed this ceremony with so much
pleasure, as spite of my misery; and hurt I never felt the like before, nor
since; but at length, after this happy accord, they retired into another
chamber to think of what they should do: My Father was of the opinion, as well
as Rhodolpho, that he should send to make his complaint as soon as the Concell
should be assembled; but that he held it not fit either for him or me to stay
in his house; that the Family of the Spinolaes were powerful enough to keep
themselves from having any manifest injustice done them; and that albeit their
kinsman had been the agressor in that fight, yet the Laws would have the dead
always to be favored, and that he which had killed any one should be always
punished; that for this reason he was to retire to his Principality of Monaco,
where he might attend safely and commodiously the success of things; that place
being in a situation so advantageous, and so well fortified, as it could keep
out a Royal Army; that as for me, I should find an inviolable sactuary in the
Army of the Emperor Charles, whom I had already served; but whereas I was not
in an estate to travel, by reason of my wounds, which peradventure would keep
me a long time in my bed; and for that also he could not go out of the City
presently, because the gates were shut, he advised that without further delay,
and before the day appeared, I should be transported into some other house,
whereof the Master was so much respected, as no violence might be feared there.
Rhodolpho and Doria approved of this proposition, and began to bethink them
what place would be proper for the same; but Lodovico told them, that he was
not troubled about it, for that the Palace of Sinibaldo, Count of Lavagna,
chief of the Family of the Fiesques, would be an assured retreat for them; that
the high rank which those of that House had held in Genoua for so many ages,
would not permit that either the insolency of their enemies, or the rigor of
justice, should enterprise any thing upon them; that for the rest he doubted
not but that he should obtain that grace of them as soon as he should demand
it; that they had always favored him in all things; and that generosity was
so natural unto them, as in all times their Palaces had served for a retreat
to all worthy persecuted persons. It was then resolved, that Lodovico should go
immediately and entreat him thereunto, Doria went also along with him, and they
found him fast asleep; but my Father having told his people, that he was
necessarily to be awakened about an important affair, they knowing Lodovico
made no difficulty to do it. As soon as he saw my Father by his bedside at
such an hour as then it was, he doubted that some urgent matter had brought him
thither; wherefore he demanded of him, whether he were so happy as to be able
to serve him? Then my father recounted unto him in few words all that had
befallen me, wherevvith he was so strangely surprised; but without giving him
leave to make his request he to told him, that he was too blame in not causing
him to be brought to his house. And when my father answered him, that he durst
not do it before he had entreated him thereunto, Sinibaldo seemed to be
offended with that circumspection, but since the fault was done, he would
pardon it upon condition, that himself might go and help to convey me thither.
And so calling to his servants he commanded them to make him ready with all
speed. My father did all that he could to stay him from going, but could not
prevail, for Sinibaldo told him, that the Spinolaes were violent, and that
peradventure meeting them in the street a second misfortune might happen, that
when he should be present with all his train, he could not believe they would
be so daring, or so strong, as to set upon us. My father then consented to what
he pleased, and he being quickly ready, they parted instantly to go to
Rhodolpho, who in the mean time had settled his domestic affairs. When
Sinibaldo was arrived, and had represented to Rhodolpho how glad he was of our
reconciliation, he prayed my father and him to arm all their people, and to
give order for whatsoever was necessary for the transporting of me, during the
which he approached to the bed where I lay, exceedingly afflicted to see them
going to separate me from Isabella, who was withdrawn to the other end of the
chamber, when as Sinibaldo entered; but as soon as he perceived it, he told me
that he would not deprive me of an happiness, which I was so suddenly to
forego, and that he should have leisure enough at home to commend my valor;
that if he durst he would have desired Isabella to return thither again, but
that he thought it fitter to leave us at liberty together; herewith he went
forth without giving me time to answer him; and he was no sooner out of the
chamber, but putting by the curtain I saw that Isabella was alone there; for
the confusion, wherein the house then was, had so busied Julia, as she never
thought of that civilitie; I besought her then to come nearer unto me, that I
might bid her adieu; at that word the tears came into her eyes, and my speech
failed me; she came then and sat down by my bed side, with so much sadness
painted in her face, as much augmented mine; but after I had enforced my self
to speak, I said unto her: At length, my dearest Isabella, fortune has joined
us, and fortune does separate us, but what rigor soever she does exercise
toward me, she cannot longer keep me from dying with glory, now that I have
the honor to be yours; she may indeed separate our persons, and it may be for a
long time, but she cannot disunite our hearts, if so it be true, that your
affection is answerable to mine. You may judge, said she interrupting me,
whether a maid, that has not feared to offend her glory, in loving her enemy
against the will of her Parents, be capable of change to a man that exposes
his life for her sake, and to save her fathers; believe then, and without ever
doubting, that all the powers of the earth, opposed against my design, shall
not so much as make me waver; and that Jsabella will be absolutely yours, or
never will be any bodies. Her sighs suffocated her in such sort, as it was
impossible for her to say more; and as I was about to give her thanks for so
obliging a speech, and mingle my tears with hers, Sinibaldo, Rhodolpho, Julia,
Doria, and my father came again into the chamber, so that all I could do, was
to say unto her, wringing her hand, that she should always remember her
promises, and that then she should be most assured, that nothing but death
should separate us. Immediately hereupon they, which had order to carry me
away, approached to my bed, and by the commandment of Sinibaldo, seated me in a
chair, that was prepared for me. Rhodolpho, who most tenderly loved his wife,
and daughter, began then to bid them farewell: Jsabella, who till that instant
had kept her self from weeping, seeing she had a fit opportunity for it, shed so
many tears, and fell a crying in that manner, as moved all the assembly to
pity: I knew for all that, manger my sorrow, that I shared therein with her
father; who, willing to show some constancy in this occasion, bad her to come
unto me, and give me her hand. To tell thee, my Lord, what I felt in the moment
of our separation would be impossible for me, since it is certain that I had
never so much grief, as I had at that time, in eloigning my self from Jsabella,
but in the end I was to resolve for it; and after I had kissed her hand without
speaking to her but with my eyes, I was carried away, so lost, as I do not
remember the order that we held in the streets; howbeit I was told afterward,
that Sinibaldo divided his men into two parts, and that I was placed in the
midst of them, where Rhodolpho and Doria had in charge not to abandon me,
whatsoever should arrive; Sinibaldo put himself into the head of the Troop, and
my father marched in the rear, to the end that on what side soever they were
assaulted, a man of command and courage might still be there. But whereas the
Spinolaes knew not that we were retired to Rhodolphoes house, they never
thought of lying in wait for us, so that we got to Sinibaldoes without any bad
encounter; After I was laid in bed, he and my father advised, that it would be
easier for Rhodolpho to get away to Monaco as soon as it was day, than if he
stayed longer, because his enemies had not had leisure yet to think and
consider of all, that might hurt, or help them; to that purpose they judged it
fit to disguise him like a Mariner, and to put him into a Feluca, which might
easily carry him to that place of safety. Rhodolpho consented to whatsoever
they thought good, and Sinibaldo took upon him the care of dispatching the
business: He sent then to the Port as soon as day began to appear, to hire a
Feluca, upon condition it should part presently, and that the Master of it
should lend one of his habits; the money which was offered to this man, was so
much, as ravished with this encounter, and without further inquiry, he said
that he was ready to part, and that for one of his habis he would lend it, so
as he might be permitted to go home to his house, because he had none there.
He that made the bargain agreed he should do so, but for fear he should
discover any thing he would go with him. The Master of the Feluca, who thought
of nothing but his gain, was contented with it; away they went together to
fetch that habit, and that done, he left that man in the guard of one of his
fellows, whom he had brought thither with him, and came and rendered an account
of his voyage. Immediately Rhodolpho disguised himself, and seeing it pretty
far day he took his leave of Sinibaldo and my father, who both of them promised
him to do in his name all that they had resolved on, and whatsoever else they
judged would be requisite to procure his liberty. Lodovico and he showed so
much generosity in this separation, and spoke so obligingly one to another, as
Sinibaldo could not forbear telling them, that Spinola could not have been lost
more profitably for the Commonwealth, seeing his death had served to make two
so great and excellent men become friends. When they had answered to this
civility, Rhodolpho came to me, with so much kindness, and such testimony of
acknowledgement and friendship, as I was sensibly touched therewith: He assured
me once again with oaths, that his daughter should be the reward of the blood
which I h^d shed for him, provided I did not change my resolution. The weakness
wherein I was, did not keep me from rendering him thanks, as I ought, for so
obliging a discourse; but at length he went away to find out the Master that
waited for him: Sinibaldo did not let him go without a guard; he caused six of
his servants to follow him a loof of, and he himself went to the Port for to
see him part. Rhodolpho was so fortunate, that he crossed through the City
without meeting any one that knew him; he imbarqued himself then with all
possible speed, and in a little time arrived safely at Monaco, where he was
received by his subjects with joy. As soon as the Council was set, they would
have complained in Rhodolphoes name, but they found themselves prevented by the
space of a quarter of an hour only; and that the father of him whom I had
killed, had accused me for the death of his son: for though our fight was in
the night, yet was I known by my voice, and the followers of him that was
slain had marked, how he and I were engaged in a particular combat. This
accusation appeared at first so unlikely to the Judges, as they gave no credit
at all unto it; and whereas they were not ignorant of that inveterate hatred
which was between the Justinianoes and the Grimaldies, they could not
comprehend how I should be induced to fight for mine enemy. As they were in
this pain, my Father presented himself to demand justice of them for the
violence had been done me, and to color the matter he told them, that passing
by chance along the street, I had seen Spinola set upon Rhodolpho with so much
advantage, as my generosity not able to endure it, I presently resolved to
labor the hindering of that mischief, or if I could not, to side with the
weaker party, as I have done; that in this occasion I had been dangerously
hurt; that nevertheless knowing the power of the Spinolaes, and fearing lest
the Senate should be misinformed of the truth of the matter, I had absented my
self till such time as justice was done me. My Father made this discourse with
such earnestness, and so advantagiously for Rhodolpho, as it was easy to
discern that he was no longer his enemy. But whereas the affair was important,
in regard it concerned three of the principal Families of the City, they
resolved nothing for the present, but referred the matter to the next day, with
order notwithstanding to the Spinolaes to cause their witnesses to be examined
the day following. This news was instantly spread over all the City, with so
much admiration and astonishment, as no body could believe it the first time
they heard it; contrarily all those of Genoua said openly, how it could not
possibly be, for that the hatred which passes successively into the minds of
men cannot be extinguished in a moment, and that by consequence it was not
credible, that I could pass from one extremity to another in an instant, and
that I should render to the greatest of mine enemies all that the dearest of my
friends could expect from me. But as nothing can be long concealed, it was
quickly known, that love had begot friendship, and that the passion which I had
for Isabella, was the noble cause of this adventure. In the mean time the whole
Commonwealth was divided; and although the faction of Sinibaldo were the
stronger and most considerable, and that it was absolutely for us, yet could it
not hinder the passing of an express order for the searching out, and
apprehension of us. And whereas the dead party is always regarded, all the
grace we could obtain was, that the affair should not be precipitated, and that
it should be prolonged as much as the forms of Justice would permit. Whilst
things past in this manner, I wrote every day to Isabella, who answered me with
so much wit and sweetness, as I could not be but happy in the constraint
wherein I lived. But at length my wounds being cured, I was ashamed to remain
shut up in a house at a time wherein I might make use of my courage, and show
my Judges that I was not a man to be cast away; howbeit I felt an extreme
violence for the executing of this resolution; for though I were deprived of
the sight of Isabella, as well within Genona, as if I had been further off, yet
found I for all that some content, in thinking that we were within the
enclosure of one and the same City; but sense was to give place unto reason,
and I was to follow the will of Isabella, which served much to make me depart
the rather, for knowing the violence of my passion, she imagined that being
thoroughly well, I would have much ado to keep my self from stealing unto her
some evening, according to the proposition I had made her to that purpose; so
that to avoid the mischief that might arrive to me thereby, she pressed my
departure: I propounded it to my Father, who approved of it; the difficulty was
to get forth of Genona without danger; but whereas Sinibaldo never found any
thing difficult to serve his friends, he told us, that he had an infallible
means for to do it; that I should but only get me in the night to his Galley,
which being ready to set sail, to go and join with the Squadron of Corsica,
should for my occasion take the course of Sestra, where I should be received as
in a place that depended on him, and from thence I might easily go to Ligorne
in a Tartana. This order was exactly observed, but before my departure I
desired to confer with Doria in private; I conjured him then to take a special
care to send me news of Isabella, as often as possibly he could; and that he
should not fail to write me punctually even the least things that concerned
her. Doria promised to satisfy my desire all that he might, and to forget
nothing that he thought would content me; I entreated him also to go from me to
Isabella, for to give her my last farewell, and to receive her commands to me,
foreseeing well that Sinibaldo would make me depart as soon as it was night,
without permitting me to go to Rhodolphoes. He so worthily acquitted himself of
his commission, that Isabella had leisure to write me a large Letter, wherein
she represented the necessity of my voyage so well unto me, and gave me such
assurances of her affection, and of her fidelity, as I departed almost without
grief, such an absolute power has she ever had over my mind. I took my leave
then of Sinibaldo, and of my father, and followed the order they had prescribed
me; as soon as it was night I was conducted to the Galley in the habit of a
simple soldier; and whereas the Captain was acquainted with the business, he
made me enter into his Cabin, from whence I came not forth till he had cast
Anchor at Sestra, under pretext of taking in fresh water. I was no sooner
ashore, but I went and delivered a Letter, which I had for the Governor of
that place, who presently provided me a Tartana, that carried me to Ligorn,
where I was so fortunate as to encounter a vessel ready to set sail for Cap d'
Istria; there I quitted the sea to cross through the Country of the Grisons,
and having put my self in a fitting Equipage in a reasonable good Town, where
I stayed certain days, I past into Germany, where the Emperor Charles the
fifth was then employed in the War against the Protestants. I speak of all
these things to thy Highness, without further clearing them unto thee, knovving
well enough, contrary to the custom of the Othomans, thou understandest the
Universal History; that there are no people so far distant, of whose Religion,
Interests, Wars, and the least particularities of their Country thou art
ignorant; nor any Prince whose Exploits or Designs are unknown to thee. To
conclude, my Lord, I can tell by long experience, that thy Greatness has
extraordinary lights for all that may be comprehended by a humane spirit; and
it is out of this knowledge, that I have have not explaned my self more at
large in many places of my narration, which certainly are not intelligible in
all the extent of thy Empire, but which cannot be ignored by the most knowing,
the most mighty, and the most victorious Monarch of the World. Soliman, not
able longer to endure these praises, given him by Ibrahim, said unto him
smiling, that he had not permitted him to speak, but only of his Adventures,
and that to obey him exactly, he was to pursue his discourse without flattering
him. The Bassa, returning no other answer, but a low obeisance, continued the
course of his History in this sort: I came then my Lord, to the Emperor of the
Christians, who received me, I dare say, with joy and kindness; he remembered
still the services I had him, and in consideration thereof would have given me
employment in his Army: But whereas I was uncertain of the continuance of my
voyage, and was rather well assured, that if my business was dispatched at
Genona, I should instantly be gone, I excused my self the best I could, and
went and served amongst the Volunteers. I lived then after this manner without
any other unquietness, than what absence brings along with it, which though it
be somewhat h^rsh to a man that is passionately in love, yet tolerable to me
through the pleasure that I had done in receiving Letters from Isabella: but I
was not long in this condition; for three months after my departure I
understood the death of Rhodolpho; I knew that Julia and her daughter were at
Monaco; and to take all comfort from me, my father wrote me, how that all the
grace that could be obtained of the Senate, was the banishing of me for ever
from all the Territories of the Republique, and that upon pain of losing my
head if I were found in any part of them. I received the news with so much
anguish of mind, as I thought I should have dyed with grief: but of all these
things, that whereof I was most sensible, was the affliction of Isabella, which
I saw so well described in a Letter that she wrote me, as I forgot mine own
misfortune to lament hers. I knew the sorrow she was in for her father; I knew
the haughty humor of Julia; I knew that my banishment destroyed all our hopes;
and even then I found her tears so just, and mine flowing in such abundance, as
there was no room left to obey the commandment she had laid upon me to comfort
her, and not to think of going to Monaco, till I heard from her; but at length,
after I had a while deferred writing unto her, I sent her word, that I would
always very exactly follow her directions; that I besought her for all that to
consider, how I could not do better, seeing she could not dispose of her self,
than to come to Monaco, where, without fearing the violence of our enemies, we
might live and rest in safety; that the Spinolaes were not powerful enough to
raise an Army for to set upon us there, and that the Republique would not of a
particular interest make a general cause; that for the rest, time, it may be,
would change the order of things; that sometimes sentences had been revoked
less unjust than that which banished me, and for men that were not of the
family of the Justinianoes, and that peradventure were not more profitable for
the public good: In the end I did all that I could to obtain permission to
come unto her; I wrote also unto Julia, with so much resentment of that loss,
which was more considerable to me, than it was grievous unto her. As for my
father, I sent him word, that I would buy out my liberty with my blood, being
resolved to perform such brave things in the Wars, as my Judges, and mine
enemies themselves should wish to see me again; but that for the executing of
so noble a design, he was to permit me first to go and mary Isabella at Monaco;
and that if my life were dear unto him, I prayed him to solicit Julia, when
her tears were dried up, to accomplish Rhodolphoes promise. For Doria, I
conjured him again to be careful in curiously informing himself whether
Isabellaes mind were as firm in this encounter, as she had made me hope it
would be; for I well foresaw, that Julia, who, notwithstanding our
reconciliation, had never loved me, would bring some obstacle to my design.
After I had dispatched away my packet, I remained in so extraordinary an
unquietness, that I could not settle my mind on any object, but such, as being
ingenious to persecute me, offered every minute to my thoughts the image of a
new misfortune; but how intentive soever it was, I could not foresee that
which arrived unto me. As I was in this deplorable estate, I understood by a
Letter from Doria, that my father being infinitely afflicted for my banishment,
was dead of a Fever, the very same day that he wrote this to me; and that to
secure his estate unto me, he had past it over to the Count of Lauagna, who
questionless would conserve it faithfully for me. I must confess, my Lord, that
the loss so shaked my constancy, as it was ready to fail, and I proved in this
occasion, that the apprehensions of Nature are more powerful than all others;
and to leave no place for me to doubt of it, I had almost forgot Isabella in
this my first transport; but after that reason had combated with grief, and
that I was able to look upon my distemper with a calmer eye, I found it yet far
greater than at first I had believed it to be: I saw all at once, both the loss
of my Father, and that too of my Mistress; no way doubting but that it would be
hard for me to carry Julia to that I desired, there being no body now that had
any interest to make her keep her word. Cert^in days after this sad news I
received only a ticket from Isabella, wherein contrary to her custom I
perceived some confusion, with an absolute command not to hazard my self as yet
to come to Monaco, because her mother had told her, that having much wealth in
Genoua, she would give some order to her affairs, for fear of losing it, if she
should so soon receive me into her State and alliance; after this she made me a
protestation of fidelity, but in such terms, as made me judge that she had not
expressed all her thoughts: Yet was it not this ticket, that begot my despair
and my fury; a Letter from Doria, which I had received the same way, cleared
this aenigma most cruelly for me; by it I learned, that the Prince of Masseran,
whose state is situate between Piedmont, Montferrat, and the Millanese, being
imbarqued at Villa-Franca to pass unto Naples, where he had means, and
business, had been caught by so furious a tempest three Leagues from the Port,
that all the Pilots skill could not keep him from suffering shipwreck before
Monaco, where this Prince had been so fortunate as to save himself by leaping
into the boat, just at the same instant when as his vessel was beaten to
pieces against the point of a Rock: It told me further, that this Prince having
gotten to some houses which were on the seashore, had sent to demand
permission of the Princess, that he might stay a while in that place, for to
gather together as much as he could of the remains of his vessel, which was
not sunck, and whose men for the most part had escaped with swimming, or by the
assistance of a Barque, that by chance was then near unto them. Moreover Doria
advertised me, that Julia had received him magnificently; that not long after
it was bruted in Genoua, how that Prince was become inamored of Isabella; and
how the very same day that he wrote me this, he was told that he had put
himself into mourning for to please the Princess. All this troubled me not so
much as Doriaes conclusion, how that the Letter he had sent me from Isabella,
had been delivered to him by an extraordinary way, and how by a note which she
had written unto him, she ordained him to send her no more Letters till such
time as he had a new order from her. I no sooner read this displeasing
circumstance, but my mind was possessed with so much fury, as I was no longer
capable of reason; I found my self seized at once, with love, jealousy, anger,
grief, and revenge: I would at one instant reproach Doria, complain of the
infidelity of Isabella, revenge my self of the treason of Julia, and punish the
comerity of my Rival. Amidst the diverse passions wherewith my soul was
agitated, I framed an hundred designs, whereof the execution was impossible;
but after I had disputed with my self, I resolved to go in person to Isabella,
and demand a reason of her, why she had not acquainted me with her new
conquest; for in the end, said I, I will have the satisfaction to adore her
innocent, or to hate her guilty. But as the body and the mind are so straightly
allied together, that the one cannot suffer without the other, I fell sick the
very same day I was to depart, and so violently, as the Emperors Physicians,
who by his order visited me every day, were out of hope of saving me; and
verily had I not had a spark of hope remain^ng, that Isabella was not
inconstant, I had refused all the remedies which were given me, and that were
powerful enough to recover me thoroughly. But as if the health of the body had
not been bestowed on me, but for the better supporting the evils of the mind,
I received my deaths wound by a Letter from Doria, which gave me to understand,
that Isabella had married the Prince of Masseran, and that to put it out of all
doubt, he had learned it from Felicianaes own mouth, who not enduring her
Mistresses infidelity, without showing her resentment thereof, had been turned
away out of the Princesses service; he vvrote me also, that since the last
Packet which he sent me, he never had received any news from that inconstant
one; that Julia had made a journey to Genoua a little before that unlucky
wedding, without her daughter in her company, where she had published that that
marriage should suddenly be solemnised; that having been advertised of it, he
had gone to her for to demand of her, whether she would dishonor her self in
rendering so little respect to the ashes of her dead husband, as to fail the
promise which he had made me? That her daughter was no longer hers, seeing I
had bought her with my blood, and the life of Rhodolpho; that it was a payment,
and not a grace, which he required of her; and that at last he was resolved to
carry things to extremity rather than endure to have this injustice done me;
that to all this she had answered peremptorily, how her daughter should never
mary a man that was banished from his Country, and that if I would have promise
kept with me, I should come and solicit the performance of it at Genoua; and
that after she had said so, how she had left him, and would not hear him speak
a word more. I leave it to thy Highness to imagine the deplorable estate,
whereinto this adventure put me, it was so strange, that all my passions
reducing themselves into one, I had nothing but fury remaining; and despair so
fully seized upon my soul, as I thought no longer of revenging my self of
Julia, nor resenting the outrage which I had received from the Prince of
Masseran, nor of punishing the infidelity of Isabella, but my design was wholly
then to make away self, and to exercise upon mine person all the cruelty which
the crimes of others had deserved. This deadly thought was so deeply settled in
my heart, as if my Religion had not withheld me, I had killed my self; but at
length I resolved to go and die like a man of courage, and in a place where I
should never hear Isabella named, and where Doria should not find me: I
concluded then to pass into Swethland, whose King was at that time in War with
the Done, with a purpose to expose my self to so many perils, as I might dye
nobly in some one of them; resolving yet further, that if fortune should work a
prodigy in preserving me, to go and confine my self into the horrid deserts of
Finland. I stole away then secretly, and without taking leave of the Emperor I
imbarqued my self upon the Baltique Sea, where I had not been three days, but
they of the Vessel, wherein I was, discovered the Fleet of that valiant King
of Algier, Chairadin Barbarossa, whom a dreadful tempest had driven into that
Sea. This encounter gave me as much joy, as it caused fear in them with whom I
was; for I verily believed that I should soon set a period to my pains, by
finding on the Sea that, which I went seeking for on the land: And whereas I
perfectly spoke the German tongue, I represented unto them, that since there
was nothing left to our choice, but death, or slaverie, being not able to fly,
for that the wind was contrary to us, it was better generously to resolve for
the first, than to submit our selves to the other; that the loss of liberty
being more grievous and shameful, than that of life, they were at the least to
sell it dearly: In the end, my Lord, I animated them in such sort, as against
all appearance they resolved, not only to fight, but to go and board the first
vessel that should advance. This resolution was no sooner taken, but Chairadin
loosed two of his Fleet to come up unto ^s; when they were within cannon shot
we discharged one against another without much effect, but suddenly they
separated themselves to enclose us, which observed by us we would have
retired, but the svviftest of the two having fetched us up, I presently
boorded her; it was there, my Lord, that I fought against my own good
fortune, and that I labored to lose a life, which thou have rendered precious
unto me, in preserving it since by a goodness that never had example, and which
thy power has made happy in despite of the malice of my destiny: I did then,
my Lord, all that I could in this occasion to deprive me of the honor of being
thy Highness creature; but fortune, being resolved to save me, was adverse to
us, for to be favorable to me; for Chairadin, whon was unwilling to have this
victory cost him dear, and that saw well how we fought like desperate men,
advanced with all his Fleet: As soon as those of our Vessel perceived it,
their weapons fell out of their hand, and I was he alone that did not render my
self, though it be true, that I left not for all that to have the same fate,
for having been wounded in four places, the loss of blood weakened me in such
sort, as I fell down like one dead on the hatches; my swooning lasted so long,
that I came not to my self again till I had been carried to another Vessel,
where all the hurt men were laid; there I was dressed amongst the rest, and
entreated after the same manner, until we came to Algier, where soon after I
was sold to the Bassa Sinan, together with three hundred others, which were
destined to thy Highness; and so within a few days we were imbarqued for
Constantinople, where I had the honor to be made thy slave, and to wear
chains, which have been more glorious to me, than the possession of an Empire,
and which I would always prefer before liberty. After this, my Lord, I have
nothing else to say unto thy Highness concerning that which regards the rest of
my fortune, seeing it is the work of thy hands, and that I could not bring it
again to thy remembrance without offending thy modesty, knowing well enough by
experience, that the image of thine own virtues makes thee cast down thy
looks, and change color: I will not tell thee then by what means thou have
drawn me out of irons for to raise me up to the greatest commands of thy
Empire, but I will only say, that in the midst of this pomp, and of this
glory, I am in one day become the most wretched of men; and not to keep thy
Majesty any longer in suspense, may it please thee to know, that the generous
slave, to whom thy Highness has given his life, is the same Doria, whom thou
have heard so often mentioned in my adventures, that dear confident of my
loves, and the most faithful of my friends; Soliman, having interrupted him,
demanded, whether he had not set him at liberty; but Ibrahim answered, that he
alone could give it him, and that because he would do nothing of his own
private authority, after he had talked with him a little, he had returned him
to the Bassa of the Sea, i^treating him to use him kindly till such time as he
heard further from him, not knowing whether his Highness did intend to grant
him his full liberty. The Sultan then commanded him to break his chains
forthwith, and to prosecute his discourse. Ibrahim would have fallen on his
knees to have thanked Soliman for that grace, but he not suffering him enjoined
him once again to satisfy his desire; and therefore exactly to obey him, the
Bassa continued in this sort. The triumph being finished, I was no sooner in my
Palace, but I shut up my self in my Cabinet with that dear Slave; I will not
tell thee, my Lord, the taking that Doria and I were in, since it is a thing
that may be more easily imagined that spoken: Doriaes amazement was so great to
see me alive, to find me in the habit which I wear, and to observe me in the
rank which I hold, as his reason above an hundred times gave his eyes the lie:
As for me, I was no less surprised to see him at Constantinople, and to embrace
him in the habit of a Slave, than he was to behold me with a Turbant. Our first
motions of joy being over, I confess, my Lord, that my first thought was for
Isabella; well now, said I unto him, my dear Doria, has the Prince of Masseran
triumphed over all my hopes, and has he rendered himself possessor of an
happiness which he did not deserve, and which I thought I had been Master of? I
had not so soon made an end of speaking, when as Doria fell to demand pardon of
me, to accuse himself of too much precipitation, to commend the constancy of
Isabella, and to blame my despair; but because this discourse was obscure, I
requested him to clear it unto me: Whereupon he told me, that Julia was no
longer amongst the number of the living, that the Prince of Masseran was dead,
and that Isabella was never his wife; but to particularize this unexpected
event, thou may be pleased to understand, that as soon as Julia perceived
the Prince of Masserans love to Isabella, she resolved, seeing the authority
wholly in her self by the death of her husband, to make that secret hatred she
had always born me to flash out; whereunto also may be added, that this woman
being ambitious, it may be the Title of a Sovereign blinded her, and carried
her to that cruel design of destroying all our pleasures; to attain the more
easily thereunto, she thought it would be fit utterly to break off our
commerce, which was not very hard for her to do, for Monaco is seated on the
height of a great Mountain, almost inaccessible on the three sides; the other
which looks to the Sea is so steep, as one cannot behold it without horror;
there rests then but one winding way which leads to the Port, so that whereas
this Town has but one only avenue, and has always a Garrison in it, it was
easy for her to keep the Princess from receiving any intelligence from me, or
giving me any; without doubt it was the fear of this rigorous proceeding that
obliged the Princess to write unto Doria to send her no more Letters. In the
mean time Julia said openly to all the world, that the Prince of Masseran was
going to mary Isabella; and whereas the Princess suffered her self to be seen of
no body, was aware no body was aware of the deceit; for I have been informed by
Doria, that as soon as she observed the passion which she had begot in the
Prince of Masseran, and that she perceived how her mother would force her to
this unjust marriage, she feigned her self sick, to the end she might with the
more civility decline the visits of this new Lover, who diverse times was upon
the point of renouncing his pretensions through the rigors of Isabella; but
Julia assured him so effectually, that she would vanquish her obstinacy,
provided he would be ruled by her, as he resolved to yield her a blind
obedience. He went then to Genona by her counsel in that manner, which the
Grandees of I^alie do often make use of, whenas they travel, and which they
call Incognito. This custom permits them to live as they will, and dispenses
others from rendering them the honors which are due to their quality; it was
then in this sort that the Prince of Masseran was at Genoua, to the end, that
being freed from receiving, or rendering the ceremony of visits, he might only
make some believe, that he was the husband of Isabella, not in precisely saying
that he had married her, but in giving way for them to think so, that spoke to
him of his abode at Monaco: For the design of Julia was to persuade every one
that this marriage was accomplished, to the end that if I were advertised
thereof, I might be capable of some extreme resolution, either upon mine own
person, or on that of the Princes, or on hers, which I could not execute
without going into a place where I should lose my head if I were found there.
This design was so well carried, that all they of Monaco believed it
themselves, and made others to believe it. This universal error, it may be,
had not for all that been fastened on Doria, if Julia had not taken a particular
care to make him believe what all the world believed; and indeed to speak the
truth, no body could have exempted himself from this imposture: For this woman,
having suborned Feliciana with gifts and great hopes, made a show of chasing
her away with violence, and to make the matter be published the better, she
sent her back to Genoua, where she was no sooner come but she repaired to Doria
all in tears. I think thy Highness remembers, that this maid had always been
Jsabellaes confifident, thou will not find it strange then if Doria did not
doubt of her discourse, when she assured him with a feigned sorrow, that the
Prince of Masseran having married the Princess with her own consent, and not
being able to forbear telling her of the promises which she had made to me,
she had been ill-intreated both by the Mother and the Daughter, who had driven
her away outragiously. It was by this artifice, my Lord, that Doria was
deceived; and whereas this news troubled him, and possessed him with fury, he
wrote it unto me as soon as he heard it, as I have already declared unto thy
Highness. But this man, whose high and generous spirit makes the interests of
his friends more sensible to him than his own, understanding that the Prince of
Masseran was at Genoua, resolved to punish him, and revenge me; and for this
effect he carefully informed himself of the place where most commonly he was,
but fortune, that intermeddles with all things, favored his enterprise, by
leting him know, that the day following he was to go and see the stately Palace
of Andrea Doria his near Kinsman, and whereas it was out of the City, he judged
this opportunity too advantageous to be neglected, imagining rightly that he
would go thither with little company, since, as I have before delivered, he was
at Genoua unknown. The matter failed not to fall out even as he had conceived
it; for he was advertised that the Prince of Masseran was in this walk attended
but with two of his servants; he went forth then speedily with the like number,
and overtaking him in a place where few persons could be witnesses of his
action. As soon as he was so near him, as he might speak to him, he asked him
whether he knew my name, and whether it were possible he should be ignorant
that Isabella could not lawfully be his, because she was mine? but since the
thing was done, he must at least render himself worthy of so noble a conquest
by the loss of his life, as I had bought it with my blood; in saying so they
both drew out their swords, and Doria without attending the Prince of Masserans
answer, attacqued him so vigoriously, as he was constrained to give ground:
They that accompanied him would have opposed themselves to this fury, but they
that followed Doria would not suffer them so to do; and whereas they were
equal in number, they began a just combat, whereof the modesty of my friend
kept him from telling me the particulars; but in the end, notwithstanding
whatsoever the Prince of Masseran could perform, the victory sided with reason,
and Doria, after the receiving of a slight hurt, pressed his enemy with so much
courage, as he ran him into the body in four several places, which made him
fall down as if he were dead: A minute after, Nature doing her last devoir, he
opened his eyes, and seeing Doria coming from parting their followers, and
giving order to his help to carry him to some place, he had yet so much
strength, as to call him, and before he expired to crave pardon for the outrage
he had done me, and to pray me to consider the power of Isabellaes eyes for the
excusing of his fault; moreover he conjured him to tell me, that the Princess
had kept her faith inviolable to me; then he acquainted him in few words with
all the violences of her mother, with all the resistances which she had made
thereunto, and at the last swore that he was not her husband, but that Julia
had used this artifice, in hope to make me away, as I have already told thy
Highness, not doubting but that if I were dead she should have carried her
daughter to all that she had desired. Scarcely had that unfortunate Prince made
an end of speaking, but he dyed in Doriaes arms, who with sorrow remitted him
into the hands of his servants, to go and provide for his own safety; so that
without losing time, and before this combat was divulged, he sent to hire a
Feluca, and without returning into the City he imbarqued himself for Naples;
for in the uncertainty of the event of the combat he had brought money enough
about him to make his retreat into that place, and had left a letter in his
Cabinet, which instructed one of his friends with the order he would have
taken in his affairs. He departed then safely away in this sort, but the next
day he incountred the Pirate Arsalon, and in the manner, which thy Highness
understood yesterday, he came to Constantinople. But my Lord, to make all the
rigor of my destiny known to thy Majesty, I am to tell thee further, that not
long since Doria has met with a slave of Monaco, who has related unto him,
that as sooon as Julia knew of the death of the Prince of Masseran, anger and
grief seized so upon her, as she died therewith in a little time; so that
Isabella, seeing she was Mistress of her self, had sent a man into Germany to
desire me to come and take care of her State, and to receive her person for a
reward of my fidelity: For she knew nothing, either of my jealousy, or
despair, which having carried me far enough from the place; whither she had
sent to seek me, beguiled all her hopes, and destroyed her felicity, by the
fruiteless return of him she had employed unto me; since that she lived in a
very austere and melancholic solitariness, saying openly, that she was
resolved to renounce the world, as soon as she knew, that I was no longer in
it. And whereas there ran a bruit in Genoua about a year ago, that I had been
seen in Naples, she dispatched away this man for to go and see if it were so;
having made a vow, if his voyage proved vain, to shut her self in a Cloister
for all the rest of her life; but whereas fortune has never done any but
extraodinary things in my adventures, she so wrought, that this man, putting
himself into a French Barque to pass over thither, was taken by a Pirate, whose
vessels lay under the covert of a Rock, which is near to a place by the
Italians called Porto Hercoles. And whereas he had a great number of Slaves, he
stayed not long from going to sell them at one of the Islands of the
Archipelago, from whence by diverse accidents this man came to Constantinople,
where Doria by chance knew him, as having at other times seen him in
Rhodolphoes service. After all this, my Lord, it will not be difficult for thy
Highness to imagine the deplorable estate wherein I find my self by thy bounty,
and by the proposition which thou have made me concerning the Sultana Asteria.
I should not be so hardy as to speak to thee in these terms, if I did not call
to mind, that the charms of the divine Roxelana have been of sufficient force
to vanquish the most victorious Monarch of the world; and that for this reason
I may hope to see thee sensible of my misfortune, to obtain pardon for my
ingratitude, and to be heard in my justifications. It is true indeed, that to
excuse my fault I need no more than to beseech thy Highness to consider, that
if I could even banish from my heart the image of Isabella, forget her
affection, her oaths, and her constancy; become the most ungrateful of men
to his Princess; cause her death by my change, which she would quickly know;
prefer my Master before my mistress, and my duty before my love; the Religion I
profess, prohibiting me the plurality of wives, which that of the Mahometans
does permit, I could not dispose of a faith, which I have already given, seeing
I am a Christian under the habit of Mussulman, although I be not believed to be
so in all the extent of thy Empire: But whereas for all that it is not just
that my temerity should be vanquished, deprive a man of thy favor, who refuses
an alliance, which a great King outght to receive on his knees: Banish from thy
sight and Court a man, whom so many benefits, whom so many greatnesses, and to
say all, whom thy affection cannot make perfectly happy; and to satisfy the
Sultana Austeria, I am ready to reenter into the irons from whence she drew me,
and to die her Slave, since I cannot live her husband: Or if thy Highness will
render my end more profitable and glorious, command me to seek out death in the
midst of thine enemies, and I shall not be long without testifying by the loss
of my life, that I am not ungrateful, but because I cannot be acknowledging.
And to incense thy just wrath, I will say further, that the chastisement, which
I demand, will be instead of grace to me, since that in depriving me of light,
I shall no longer be sensible of all the misfortunes wherewith I am so heavily
oppressed; I shall cease to live, but I shall cease also from being rebellious
to thy pleasure; I shall restore the life which I ow to the incomparable
Asterin; and I shall dye for the glory of Isabella. In brief, my Lord, since I
cannot be Asteriaes, because my love does oppose it, and my Religion does
forbid it; and since I cannot likewise live for Isabella, because my duty does
tie me to thy service, both by a general right, and by a particular
obligation, death is the only remedy that remains for me to get out of so many
miseries. If thy goodness had not broken off my fetters, and that I were still
thy slave, now when that I know that the constancy of Isabella has triumphed
over the artifice of our enemies, that I reign still in her heart, and that on
me alone her felicity or her happiness does depend, I would employ all my
endeavor to free me of my chains by a ransom: But, my Lord, I am tied to thee
by stronger bonds; the obligations wherein I am engaged to thy Highness, the
benefits which I have received from thee, the honors thou have done me, and
the last degree of glory whereunto I am mounted, are too certain proofs of thy
love, and of thy confidence, for me not to be retained in my duty: It is then
by these sacred bands that I am tied unto thee, and which I cannot break
without sacrilege. Finally, my Lord, the thoughts of liberty, which pass for a
just desire in the minds of all men, were an horrid crime in me; and I may well
promise thy Highness, that I will never so much as dream of it: And as I am
generous enough not to do any thing that may blemish my love, so am I yet more
not to do any thing that may wrong my duty. There is no need then of guards to
keep me from going out of thy Empire, being fully resolved to sacrifise all my
pleasures, rather than do any thing unworthy of the name which I carry, and
the choice which thy Highness has made of my person, for to be the first in
thy favor, as I am in thy Estates. But without further deferring pronounce the
sentence of death, so just, and so much wished for. Ibrahim having given over
speaking, Soliman rose up, fell to walking a great pace, and with his eyes
fixed on the ground continued in so deep a muse, as the Bassa doubted that he
should obtain the effect of his request; but he was not long in this
uncertainty; for the Sultan standing still, and beholding him in a manner that
testified more grief than anger, and more compassion than wrath, said unto him
with all imaginable kindness, that he held himself infinitely unhappy, in that
possessing so great an Empire, that being so victorious and triumphant, and
that being able to give felicity to so many people, yet could not render the
only man whom he could love, happy. Upon this so obliging a discourse, Jbrahim
would have fallen on his knees, but he would not suffer him, saying unto him,
that he would fain have obtained so much resolution of himself, as to part for
ever from a man, who was so dear unto him; that he had debated the same in his
mind, when as he walked in that manner, as he saw; but that at last the
affection which he bore him had surmounted his generosity, and that it was
impossible for him to resolve on so grievous a separation; that he conjured him
to excuse the effects of his friendship, as he excused those of his love; and
to testify unto him, that as well as himself he did all that he could, he
would permit him to go atd see Jsabella, provided he would pass his word unto
him to return again within six months; with this promise also, that if during
his absence he could accustom himself to this privation, he would give him his
liberty wholly and entirely. The Bassa was so surprised, and so transported
with joy, as having cast himself at the feet of the Sultan, he was a good while
without speaking, but at length, after he had recovered the use of his tongue,
he rendr^d him thanks for so notable a favor, and told him, that none but
Soliman could vanqu^^^ Soliman; that this victory which he had gotten over
himself, was so glorious to him, as all that he had done till then, was nothing
in comparison of it; that battles were gained by the valor of Captains and
Soldiers, bu^ in this occasion he owed this victory to none but his own proper
virtue. As for the rest, if he would permit him to go to Monaco, he would
engage his faith to render himself at Constantinople within the time that he
had prescribed; and that he was not to fear that he would break his word with
his Highness, since he would keep it with his very enemies. After this
assurance, the Sultan told him, that he did not doubt of it, but that which
obliged him to require an oath of him for it, was the knowledge that he had of
the force of the passion which reigned in his heart; and that his friendship
would be secured against this enemy of its content. Jbrahim swore then
solemnly, that nothing but death alone should keep him from accomplishing his
promise. That done, Soliman told him, that he would not have consented to his
voyage, knowing that his affairs were not composed at Genoua, had he not had
the means to have the sentence revoked, which had been given against him. And
when as Jbrahim besought him to to let him understand, how he thought to
perform so unexpected a a thing, the Sultan told him, that to comprehend his
design, he was but to remember, how one of his Chaoux, returning out of France,
and staying at Genoua, had been murdered in the streets by a popular
commotion; so that having been advertised thereof by one of them that
accompanied him, who instantly imbarqued himself away, he had caused all the
Vessels of the Genoueses, that were found in his Ports, to be arrested; and
that for the better favoring of his design, an Ambassador was the day before
arrived from his Republique, whom he had caused to be put in prison at Pera,
being persuaded that he had done nothing unworthy himself therein, since the
Genoueses had first violated the Law of Nations in the person of his Chaoux;
how it was for to communicate this affair unto him that he had sent for him in
the morning, but the sadness which he had observed in his countenance, had
hindered him from it, and carried him into another discourse. The Bassa then
cast himself at the feet of the Sultan, to assure him, that he would never
establish his content on the ruins of his Country. Soliman told him, that his
generosity would not contradict his intention, and that so favorable an
occasion might not be lost, he would send back this Ambassador with all the
Vessels which he had caused to be stayed, for to redeem his liberty, and that
of Doria, who had suffered so much for him. That he would write a letter to his
Republique, which should be conceived in such express terms, as they would
without doubt be enforced by fear to accord him more difficult things, than
those which he desired of them; besides that, giving them back the life of
their Ambassador, and returning them so great a number of the richest, and most
precious commodities of the Levant, they would be yet far more indebted unto
him; But in the end he was glad, that the blood of one of his servants might at
least serve to restore Ibrahim to his Country. The matter being thus resolved,
Soliman commanded the Bassa to go and deliver Doria, and the Slave of Monaco,
and not speak of this design, for he would have no inckling of the matter; but
for the better concealing of it, he ordered him to say, that he was going upon
a secret expedition, to the end they should not mervail if they saw him no
longer at the Port. After this Jbrahim withdrew himself for to give order to
his affairs; and although the passing of his word for his return begot some
melancholic thoughts in him, yet joy held the Empire of his soul, and the
only imagination of seeing Jsabella again dissipated all his heaviness. At
last his passion was so strong, that if he had been even sure to die, as soon
he came at her, yet would he not for all that have left to go. He returned
then to his Palace, followed by those multitude of Courtiers, whom the favor of
Kings renders inseparable with them which possess it.

IBRAHIM, OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The First Part.
The Third Book.
THe grand Vizier was no sooner at home, but he sent the command of the Grand
Signior to the Bassa of the Sea, to return him the Slave, with whom he had
talked the day before; but as he was generous and liberal, he caused twelve
Watches, the fairest that ever had been found in all the shops of
Constantinople, to be carried unto him; for besides the difference of the
inventions of them, their cases were so mavelous, as the Emeraulds, Rubies,
and Diamonds, made up the least part of their beauty, the art far surpassing
the matter: And whereas this curiosity is the greatest with persons of quality
amongst the Turks, having met with an hundred of them in a certain shop,
Ibrahim could not choose any thing that was more gallant, more beautiful, or
more agreeable to him, who was to receive them; but to render this present yet
more magnificent, he put these twelve Watches into a little coffer of Nacre,
garnished with Gold and Turquieses, and sent them unto him by six Slaves: As
for that of Monace, because he was not a man of any great quality, he sent him
a thousand Sultanius for his ransom. After which he shut himself up in a
lodging apart, that was a good way from his own, which was too much frequented
with people, there to receive Doria at more liberty: The Palace of the Bassa of
the Sea was not far from Ibrahims, so that it was not long before they brought
him his dearest Doria, to whom that Bassa in requital of that gallantry which
had been used toward him, had in exchange of his fetters given him a chain of
Diamonds. It was in this interview, that these two friends felt all those joys
and pleasing raptures, which true friendship causes in the souls of two
persons, who for so many years had been in despair of ever seeing one another;
their hearts were at one instant so replenished with pleasure and admiration,
as not able to express together their amazement and their joy, they remained a
good while embracing one another, without the ability to speak; but at length,
Ibrahims passion being the stronger, it obliged him to open their first
discourse by Isabella, in calling Doria his Preserver, in giving him thanks for
exposing his life to deliver her, and revenge him; and craving pardon of him
for the pains he had suffered in his captivity, as counting himself the
innocent cause thereof. Doria answered to all those things with as much
kindness as could be; but whereas love is more powerful than friendship, and
as this passion reigns imperiously over all the rest, Ibrahim returned still to
Monaco, he would have Doria particularize again that which he had already told
him the day before; he demanded of him whether it were true indeed that the
Princess loved him still? He would know of him, whether the Prince of Masseran
was an handsome man? And as if his friend could have divined what was done over
all the earth, he conjured him to tell him, whether he did not believe that
Isabella would be turned Nun when they should arrive at Genoua? In the end,
after he had asked an hundred questions, whereunto Doria had no leisure to
answer, he perceived his error, and desired him to pardon him for it with so
much earnestness, as he could not choose but smile at it. But amidst all these
mutual caresses, there were some moments wherein Doria was surpr^zed with
marvel, and whenas reason began to repossess its place in the mind of Ibrahim,
he was aware of it; and seeing his eyes fastened on his habit, he easily
apprehended, that he did not express all his thought; wherefore not to leave
him any longer in this uncertainty, he said unto him, that for the renewing of
their friendship in as strait a manner as formerly it had been, it was fit to
tell him in few words, that he was still Justiniano under the name of Ibrahim,
and that although he were the servant of Soliman, yet was he for all that the
enemy of Mahomet; that he desired him therefore not to suspect him lightly,
since he could not do so without wronging him; that if he had not been too much
pressed by the affairs which he was to communicate unto him, and which
required speed, he would have recounted to him, even at that very instant, the
wonderful progress of his fortune, but he would do that at leisure whilst they
were in their voyage together; that in the mean time he should firmly believe
how nothing was able to shake his faith, and that he would live and die in the
Religion of his Fathers. Upon this discourse Doria confessed unto him
ingenuously, that he had been strangely surprised with finding him Grand
Vizier, and the Sultans Lieutenant-Generall throughout all the extent of his
Empire, since to be that and a Christian seemed to be two things incompatible;
but in regard of that which he had told him, he would afterward forbid his
reason to judge any more upon apparances: How it was notvvithstanding true,
that he had believed that he was not absolutely culpable, but how it was
certain also, that being unable to conceive this adventure, he had been
troubled to think in what terms he should dare to inform and clear himself
therein. Ibrahim answered, that he would easily forgive him this injury, seeing
he himself could not in a manner conceive by what means, or by what ways
fortune had conducted him to the point wherein he then was: That in the mean
space not to lose time, which was to be so precious unto him, it was fit he
should tell him, that Soliman had been so good as to permit him to go and see
Isabella; and that he might do it with glory and safety, the Sultan had found
out an undoubted expedient to cause the Sentences which had been pronounced
against them, to be revoked. But whereas Doria could not easily believe that
which he heard, Ibrahim recounted every thing unto him from point to point,
just as it had been resolved in the Sultans Cabinet; but he did not discover
unto him, that he had engaged his word for his return within six months, for
fear he should be afflicted at it; for as for his fidelity he no way misdoubted
it. Doria finding that he purposed to return out of hand to Genoua, told him,
that he had lost a very affectionate friend in the person of Sinibaldo, who was
dead of sickness, as the Slave of Monaco had informed him, but that he had left
a son behind him, the heir of all his virtues, and one that promised great
matters. Is he not called Giovanni Lodovico, replied Ibrahim, after he had
bemoaned the death of Sinibaldo? Yes, said Doria, and he was not above a dozen
years old when you went away, and yet then there was great hope of him.
Hereupon one brought Ibrahim word, that the Slave of Monaco was come, which
made Doria represent unto him, that being to return to Genoua, he held it not
fit that this Slave should see him in the habit he wore, because he could not
possibly forbear publishing of it, which might prejudice him much, or at
leastwise oblige him to make a public manifestation of his adventures. Ibrahim
agreed with him therein, so that he charged him, who brought him that message,
to carry this Slave to the quarter where the Officers of his house were lodged,
which was a great way off from his own, with order to use him well, and not to
let him go out of his chamber without his express command. That done, he turned
himself to Doria, and desired him to work in such sort, as he might have the
Letter which the Princess had wrote to him by this man, to the end he might be
assured of her fidelity. Doria told him that the matter was not very
difficult, and that to oblige him to deliver it, he need but let him know,
how he was still alive; and because also he was to see him during their
Voyage, it was requisite to tell him, that he had been a slave as well as
they, and freed in the same manner, that he might not be surprised when he
should see him abord the vessel. Ibrahim approved of this counsel of his
friend, and prayed him to go instantly and labor to bring him that precious
treasure, which was able to make him happy. Doria condiscending thereunto, the
Bassa caused him to be conducted by four slaves to the place where that of
Monaco was, who a good while would not part with Isabellaes Letter, till he saw
Justiniano, because he could not believe, that a man whom he had gone to seek
for at Naples, should be at Constannople; but Doria swore so seriously unto
him, that Justiniano was alive, and that he should see him within a few days,
as at length, knowing him to be a man of great quality, and Justinianoes
friend, he suffered himself to be persuaded, and delivered him Isabellaes
Letter, which he had with much ado preserved all the time of his captivity;
presently whereupon Doria returned to Ibrahim, who attended him with extreme
impatience; as soon as he perceived him, and that they which conducted him were
retired, he lovingly embraced him, and conjured him no longer to defer his
happiness, but Doria without answering him rendered him that precious gage of
Isabellaes fidelity, which possessed our Illustrious Bassa with such joy, that
he could hardly obtain so much tranquillity from his mind, as to read this
Letter: But at last, after he had kissed it with transports that cannot be
imagined but by those who know the force of this noble passion, which reigned
in his heart, he opened it, and saw that it was thus.

The Letter of Isabella Princess of Monaco to Iustiniano.
SInce it is not enough for the felicity of Isabella to know that you are
living, but that she must also know whether she still lives in your memory, I
have sent the Lieutenant of my Guard to inform himself thereof, and to clear it
unto me, to the end that by his return, and by his answer, I may regulate the
rest of my days, conserve my self for you if you be faithful, or punish my
self for loving you if you be faulty; being fully resolved, if you live no
longer for me, to live no longer for the World, and to deprive my self for ever
of it, as soon as you shall have deprived me of the hope of seeing you again. I
do not undertake to paint forth all the miseries which I have suffered by the
persecutions of my Lovers, and of mine Enemies, by my Parents, and by your
absence; since if it be true, that it has been able to destroy in your soul a
love which ought to last eternally, it would but add more to my confusion, and
to your crime; raise up a trophy my self for mine Enemy; follow voluntarily the
Chariot of the Conqueror; and serve for an ornament to the triumph of some
stranger, who it may be has vanquished you. But if nevertheless it should
happen that my fear and suspicions should render me faulty toward you; that
you should be always Justiniano, as I am always Isabella; that this so noble,
and so pure a passion, which I had given a being unto in your soul, should
reign there still, as it does still reign in mine; I durst beseech you, if
Monaco seem too weak to defend you, or too near to Genoua to live there in
quiet to let me understand in what place of the earth you will have us live
together; for in fine I shall always quit my State without regret for to
conserve unto my self the Empire which you have given me over your heart. Let
me know then what I am to expect from my fortune, with a promise, if it be so
that I have no longer a place in your remembrance, never to murmur more at my
misfortune, but accuse my defects for your change, and since I cannot live for
you, never to be any bodies, ^ut to dye in a Cloister. This is all the grant
which is demanded of you by

Your ISABELLA.


Hardly could Ibrahim retain his tears in reading Isabellaes letter, which had
made him change color more than once, according as it was either more or less
obliging; and as jealousy and fear are undoubted marks of strong ^ffection,
that which the Princess testified unto him gave him at one instant both grief
and joy; he was grieved that Isabella should suspect him of infidelity, he was
not sorry that she was afraid to lose him; and as if he had not read it well,
he began to run it over again, and after he had made an end of reading it, he
looked on all sides of the paper, to see if nothing else were there written: He
read the superscription of it, he considered it even to the very sea; and in
the end he thought he should have committed a crime if he had lost so much as
one syllable of that precious pledge of Isabellaes love. This letter so
mightily increased his flame, that his unquietness grow to be half so much more
than it was. The discourse of the Princess seemed so pressing unto him, as he
began to fear in good earnest, lest she should ^ake some extreme resolution
before he could get to Monaco; he concluded therefore to forward the matter as
much as he could, and for a beginning he left Doria, after he had caused books
to be given him to entertain the time withal, and commanded some of his
servants to wait near unto him for to serve him; the rest of the day he
bestowed in giving order for all things necessary for his voyage; he commanded
a Christian Slave, in whom he much confided, to cause an habit after the
Italian fashion to be secretly made, and gave him more money than need, both to
pay for it, and to procure the fidelity of the Jews, who should sell it unto
him; for it is from those kind of men, that the great diversity of Nations
which people Constantinople and Pera, are furni^hed with all things necessary
for them, be it household-stuffe, apparel, or jewels. That done, he caused
the principal Officers of his house to be called unto him, and having told
them, that the Grand Signior sent him upon a secret expedition, from whence he
should not return in six months, he commanded them that during his absence
they should obey, as himself, a man, who was as it were the Steward of his
house; and that they should cause all the rest that depended on them, to obey
him in like manner; he assigned means also for the maintenance of his Train,
as it used to be; and after he had promised them recompenses if they continued
in their duty, and chastisements if they did o^herwise, he went to his dear
Doria, and being somewhat late, they separated themselves; Ibrahim, not willing
that his people should observe so strict a union betwixt them, got away to bed,
after he had made a light supper, though he had eaten nothing all the day
before; As for Doria, he was served in private, but with a great deal of
magnificence. The next morning, according to the order he had received for it,
Ibrahim went to the Seraglio; and whereas he had a particular permission to
come thither at all times, whenever he would, he went into the Sultans
chamber, who was not ready. Soliman, seeing him come in, said unto him, how he
was glad to observe in his countenance that the remedy, which he had found out
for his grief, was not in vain; but to make an end of healing him speedily he
had commanded over night that the Ambassador of Genoua whom he had caused to be
made a prisoner at Pera, should be brought unto him; the Sultan told him
further, how he had given order, that the Ambassador should come without
ceremony, because if the ordinary custom had been observed, Ibrahim then, as
the chief Bassa, must have presented him, which he not thinking fit, for that
so he would have known him, he chose rather to hold this course; besides also
that sending to have him received at the gate of the City, and causing him to
be presented with an horse, and roab of cloth of gold, according to the use,
he engaged himself consequently to give him public audience, which he would
not do, to the end he might speak more openly to him concerning the matters he
desired of him. The Sultan was no sooner ready, but he was advertised by a
Capigibassa, who is one of the Captain^s of the Port, that this Ambassador was
arrived, whereupon he commanded, that a Bassa should go to receive, and bring
him unto him; and that Ibrahim might hear what he said unto him he made him
enter into his Cabinet. A little after this Ambassador appeared with a Turkish
roab on, which had been given him without any ceremony at his departure from
Pera; for it is the custom of the Sultan to receive no Ambassadors but such as
have one of them on, according to the manner of the Country. He was sustained
under the arms by two Capigibassi; the Bassa that conducted him, marched two
paces before him to present him to the Sultan, who received him with some
civility: when as he had saluted the Grand Signior, he delivered the Letter
that the Republique had written to him, which Soliman gave unto a Dragoman, who
interpreted it unto him for forms sake only, for he understood it better than
he. No sooner had he done hearing him, but he caused the same Interpreter to
tell the Ambassador, that the injury which he had received in the person of his
Chaoux, was so great, that if he had followed his just fury, his head had
answered for that violence; how it was for that he had caused him to be
arrested, but that he had since changed his mind at the intercession of a
Christian slave, who had been a suitor to him for it, and that had found grace
before his Highness; but that for returning him back, as he was going to do,
together with all the vessels which he had caused to be stayed in his Ports,
and for forgetting also the outrage that he had received from his Republique,
they were to accord him one thing, which he desired of them. And when as the
Ambassador had answered him, that the thing should be impossible if they did it
not, he told him, how all that he would have was, that the Senate should revoke
the Sentence which they had pronounced against Justiniano, and that Doria
should be no more troubled for the death of the Prince of Masseran; that it was
Justiniano to whom Genoua owed her safety, and to whom he was to render thanks
for his life; that he remitted both him and Doria to his conduct, for the
putting of that in execution which he desired; but that he should take good
heed they failed not therein, because if that should happen, nothing should be
able to keep him from making War upon Genoua it self with all the forces of his
Empire. This Ambassador was so surprised with hearing the Sultan speak of
Justiniano and Doria, as it had diverse times like to have made him forget the
respect which he owed him, for to interrupt him, but at length after Soliman
had given over speaking, he answered him, that the thing he desired was so
beneficial to the Republique, as his Highness need not fear to be refused;
that the merit of those two excellent men was so generally known, as the Senate
had not obeyed the Laws but with grief, and that doubtless they would be
extremely joyful of so just and specious a pretext to infringe them. After
this Soliman dismissed him, and told him yet once again, how he should
remember, that in this occasion they were to satisfy him, or to have him their
enemy; howbeit he somewhat caressed him in bidding him farewell, and excused
the not receiving him with all requisite Ceremonies for some reasons which he
might not tell him; that in the mean time he should prepare himself for his
departure, and that he should have his dispatch. When he was retired according
to the custom, that is, without turning his back to the Sultan, Ibrahim came
forth of the Cabinet, and cast himself at his feet, to give him thanks for so
many testimonies of the affection which he received every minute from his
Highness. But Soliman took him up, and told him, that eight years service well
deserved that acknowledgment; that withal likewise in laboring for his good,
he should establish his own felicity, which would never be perfected till he
saw him contented; that the impatience he was in for his departure, was
occasioned by the desire he had of his return, and that it might no longer be
deferred, he was to go and make an end of taking order for his affairs, and
that immediately after noon he should come and bid him adieu, and bring Doria
with him. Ibrahim answered to all these things with as much generosity, as
kindness; and for a conclusion, he deeply protested never to think himself
acquitted of the infinite obligations wherein he was engaged to his Highness,
but in sacrifising his life for his service. He would have proceeded further,
but the Sultan interrupted him, and once more commanded him to have no other
thought than of going to see the incomparable Isabella, and of giving life
again to Soliman. After this the Grand Vizier durst not make any reply, but
retired homewards to go unto his dear Doria whom he had not seen since the
evening before, and he encountered him in the Hipodrome, so intentive in
observing the stately structure of his Palace, as the Bassa was fain to speak
to him before he would heed him, or be drawn out of so sweet a contemplation:
But when as D^ria seemed to be unwilling to stir from thence, till he had at
leisure considered that Masterpiece of Architecture, Ibrahim told him he was
contented he should, so as he stayed not long about it, for that having goodlier
things to show him, and not having much time to spare, they were to manage so
much as they had, till dinner was made ready, in letting him see all the
beauties of the Palace which he had caused to be built: That whereas he was
skillful in Painting, in Perspective, in Architecture, in rarities, and in all
parts of the Mathematics, he should be glad to know, whether according to his
judgment all the rules of those fair Arts, and of those excellent Sciences,
were found to be observed there, as according to his they were. But first, said
Doria to him, I would fain know, how in so little a time you could make up a
building, which for its greatness, and for the magnificence of its structure,
would require the whole life of a man, and the treasures of a great Prince.
This last, replied Ibrahim, is the only necessary thing, for with it is done in
a small time, what whole Ages, and all the industry of man could not do without
it; and both to answer you, and to take from you the means of troubling me with
new objections, I am to let you know, that having a purpose to build this
Pal^^e, I easily found out a way to do it, as well speedily, as magnificently:
For dispo^ing of all the Revenue of the Empire, I could want nothing save
Artisans to execute my design, but fortune sent me them; for good luck would,
that a great Architect, two Painters, and two Sculptors, having put themselves
in company together for to pass out of Italy into Spain, from whence they had
been sent for to make a stately Palace for the Emperor, were taken by Pirates,
who afterward sold them here at Constantinople; and whereas I have always
been very careful to inform my self of places where any Christian slaves were,
that I might relieve them, I met with these same, knew what they were, and
employed them for two whole years together; after which I sent them back in a
vessel laden with riches. You have peradventure heard say, that the Turks do
not suffer the image of any living thing to be made, and that the Alcoran seems
to forbid it; but as in all Religions heresies do from time to time arise, this
same, which is composed of nothing but absurdities, has not been wanting
therein; for some remedy whereof they one day cast into the River of Adezelia,
that runs by Damascus, two hundred Camels lading of Books of the different
opinions of their Religion, retaining but six of them, which since have
produced many others, whereof one maintains upon this Article, that the rest
have misunderstood that passage, where their Prophet had no other meaning, but
to forbid them the worshipping the images of men, of beasts, and of plants, and
not the making of them for the ornament of houses: And indeed this opinion has
been followed chiefly by the Grandees. The Seraglio has its Galleries full of
Mosaique work, where are seen great store of interlaced foliage, and birds
represented by suitable pieces of differing Marble. The Emperor Selim could
paint himself, and he sent a Battle, drawn with his own hand, to the Venetians;
and Soliman his son has his Fathers Picture always hanging by his bedside;
so that after such illustrious examples I have adorned this Palace, but with
pictures and statues, wherein it may be you will find wherewith to satisfy the
knowledge which you have in those excellent arts.

The description of Ibrahims Palace.
WHilst the Bassa was talking in this sort, he and his friend came still nearer
to the Gate, where Doria stayed to consider the superb front of a great
Paviglion, which rose up into a Dome over the Gate, and that equally divided a
long wall of white Marble, which made the enclosure of that great and
marvailous fabric. Doria could not sufficiently admire three orders of columns
of differen^ Marbles, which adorned that Portall, whereof the basis and
capital, were of Brass, but wrought with so much art, that neither the Greeks
nor the Romans have ever showed any fairer; some were wreathed, some fluted,
and others so artificially twined about with fillets, as they seemed to press
down the foliage, wherewith it was enriched; over the Corniches and Frizes of
half relieve, which were garnished with leaves of Acanthes, were nothing but
Chaplets of Triumph, Cornucopiaes, and Trophies of Arms. Finally, the
magnificence of the Palace was so great, that the very gates of it were of
Ebony, with mouldings so curiously proportioned, as the great silver nails
wherewith they were studded all over, made the least part of their beauty.
Doria was not yet resolved to quit so rare an object, had not the Bassa forced
him to enter, that he might observe the Vaulting which sustained the Paviglion,
whose key-stone was an Onix of a prodigious bigness, and whereof the Artist had
so well contrived all the colors, and made such use of them, as he had thereof
formed a Coronet of flowers, so admirably well done, that it beguiled the
sight: The rest of the Vaulting was all of white Marble, the better to set off
so fair a work, but so well joined and polished, as it seemed to be made of one
entire stone. After he had sufficiently considered so rare a thing, Ibrahim
caused Doria to observe, that opposite to the Paviglion, which he so much
admired, was another just like unto it; but before he went further Doria stayed
to consider a great low covered Gallery which compass^d the Court about, and
whereof the roof served for a Terrace, with a rail and ballister of a leaning
height; it was sustained with pillars of white and red Marble, and paved as the
Court with white and black. But whereas Ibrahim knew that there was somewhat
yet more mavelous to be seen, he made his dear Doria to pass along under the
second Paviglion, and although the vaulting of it was fairer than the other
that he had already seen, yet did he not make any stay there, so much was he
ravished with the magnificent Forefront of Ibrahims Palace, which wholly
discovered it self from thence; and truly I must confess, that he had reason so
to be, since all that art and materials can contribute to the beauty of a
work, was eminently found in this same. There appeared a great Building that
took up the whole breadth of the Court, which was retrenched some thirty paces
from the House by a Ballustrade of Jasper and Porphirie, and raised on the
Palace-side the height of four steps, which formed in the middle an half pace
of the same matter. The pavement of this Court was gray and white Marble, and
in the midst of it was a Fountain, whereof the bole was of Oriental
Alablaster, transparant as Crystal, and six foot Diameter, born up by a
pillar of divers-coloured Marble; the outside of the bole was enriched with
little Sea Monsters of half relieve, admirably well done. Round about the
pillar were four Harpies of Brass, their paws reaching to the depth of the
Cistern, and their backs turned opposite the one to the other to uphold the
pillar; the tips of their wings extended also to the bottom of the Alablaster
bole, as seeming to bear it up; they had women's faces, but Serpents writhen
talls finishing in antic foliage, which met together on the top of the pillar
just against the Center of the bole, whereunto likewise it served for an
ornament: In the midst of this bole was a Vase reverst, made also of Oriental
Alablaster, which on its foot sustained a round basis, whereupon were set the
three Graces, almost quite naked, made of Corinthian metal; they stood back to
back, ejecting water out their breasts, and each of them holding a Cornucopia,
which met all together a little above their heads; out of the flowers and
fruits, which were represented there with suitable pieces, made of Agates,
Onixes, Turqueises, Carnalines, Topazes, and Emeraulds, issued six spouts of
water, which fell down into the hole, and disgorged themselves into the Cistern
through the muzzels of six Lions that were seen on the outside thereof. As for
the six others, which issued from the breasts of the Graces, and that did not
spin out, they fell just into the heads of fix Dragons of brass, which were on
the brim of the bole, and that rendered them again through their mouths: These
Dragons seemed to strive to get out of it, holding the brim with their tallons,
the rest of their bodies, except their heads, and the tips of their wings,
seeming to be hidden therein; so that those twelve spouts of water, coming to
cross one another, made so pleasing an object and murmr, as both sight and
hearing found at one and the same time wherewithal to be satisfi^d. The
Cistern of this Fountain was of Marble, but wrought with such art in Mosaique
work, as there appeared in the bottom through the water fishes, so admirably
well represented, that one might be deceived by them at the first fight; this
Cistern had also round about it a little Balustrade of Jasper, for one to rest,
and meditate upon. After that Doria had well admired this Fountain, he gave his
whole mind and attention to observe the beauties of this mavelous frame; he
saw then, that from each side there went a vving of building, which extended
even to the Balustr^de of Jasper and Porphirie, and whereof the structure and
symetrie was suitable to the middle front: Each of these wings, as well as the
grand fabrique, had a Copola, covered over with sheets of brass, whereof the
moity having received an impression of fire, it had rendered then of a mixed
color between purple and blew, which the Painters cannot well represent, and
which showed a wonderful object, being opposed to the other sheets, whereunto
had been given a tincture of gold. The rest of the roof was covered in the
same manner, as well as the Paviglions, whereof I have spoken; but when as
Doria came to cast his eye a little lower, and to observe that all the
ornaments of this Fabrique were of Jasper, Chalcedonie, Agate, and Onix, he was
so surprised, as he could not forbear demanding, whether this which he saw was
not enchantment: But though the abundance of Festons, of Trophies of Arms,
Arabesques, Vases of incense, Frizes, Corniches interlaced with Drapery,
extinct Torches, Cornucopiaes, and Chaplets of triumph, gave him a world of
admiration, yet was he far more surprised to behold four and twenty Columns of
Touch, which seemed to sustain the first Order, and which were placed by two
and two in equal distance, between each window; the basis and capitalls of
them were of white and red marble, in correspondencie to the body of the
building, which was wholly constructed thereof; but to preserve these Columns,
and to render them withal the more magnificent to the eye, they were twyned
about with the leaves of Achanthes of brass guilt, which yet was no hindrance,
but that one might distinctly discern of what stone they were made, so as the
beauty of them might be admired for their prodigious greatness. Over the
Entrata was a statue of Soliman on horseback in base relieve; and on each side
between those Columns were six Niches, filled with six great statues of women,
habited a L'antipue, and representing the diverse Natitions subjected to
Solimon, who with one hand seemed to offer him their Crowns, and with the other
leaned on the Scutcheons of the arms of the Kingdoms, which they represented.
After he had well observed all these marvailes of Art and Nature, Ibrahim told
him, that having yet many things to show him, which it may be deserved his
approbation, as well as those he had already viewed, it was requisite they
should make a turn in the Garden, that all the outside might be considered
before he let him see that the inside was not ill understood; he made him pass
then under a great Vaulting, which traversed the whole body of the House, from
whence one descended to the Garden by a large half pace of Porphirie. This
Vaulting was all of Mosaique work, composed of different Marbles and Jaspers,
upon a ground of Alablaster, but so wonderfully wrought, as an excellent
Painter could not with a pencill interlace a foliage more artificially, better
observe the lights, and the shadows, nor make a fairer piece with liquid
colors, which by his mixture of them he renders such as he pleases, than this
excellent Artisan of so beautiful a work had done with suitable pieces,
whereof the colors were all simple and natural, and the joining of them
together imperceptible to he clearest sighted eyes. Jbrahim, whose impatience
was extreme, and who imagined, that every moment employed by him any other way,
than in thinking of his departure, was an outrage to his love, and a crime
toward Isabella, pressed Doria so much, as he made him descend into the
Garden; howbeit he stayed a little on the top of the half pace the better to
consider the beauty and extent of it. He saw upon the first sight of it four
preat parterres, in the midst whereof was a Round of an extraordinary bigness,
about the which were seen upon the bases of green Jasper fix figures of
fishermen, as big as the life, whereof there were three that held each of them
a Trident in his right hand, with the arm lifted up for to dart it; and the
other three testified by their action the joy which they felt for having hurled
theirs so rightly, as that they had therewith struck a Sea Monster, which was
represented in the middle of the Round, lying half along on his side, his head
and his tail out of the water, and with so much art, as he seemed to be somewhat
pained with the hurts which the three Tridents had given him, and from whence
issued three ejects of water, that were in stead of blood to him. Just opposite
to the half-pace and the Round was a Grot, admirably fair, both for the matter
whereof it was formed, and for the art wherewith it was made, so that Doria,
being much taken with this object, seconded the grand-Visiers design, and went
on as fast as he desired him; the Bassa, not to lose time, caused him to
observe in going along, that on each side of his Garden was a close arbor,
erected with porticoes of verdures, where the Gardener had made it well
appear, that he was not ignorant of all the beauties of Architecture, since it
had not any ornament there, which was not of the same proportion, and of the
same symetry, as was observed over all that stately Palace. He made him also
cast his eye to both the sides of the Grot, from whence there ran a Balustrade
of Jasper, beyond the which was seen on the right hand a Laberinth, so
artificially contrived, that it might be called a prison without a gate; it
being most certain, that without at the least a prodigious chance, or being
taught by him that made it, one could not get out of this Dedale, what care
soever a man took to mark how he went into it: Doria would fain have gone and
made trial of it; howbeit Ibrahim would not suffer him, but obliged him to
look toward the left side of the Balustrade, where was seen a Grove of Orange,
Citron, Pomegranate, and Myrtle trees; and although the prospect of this place
was delectable, and the sent of it odoriferous, yet Doria past by them to
admire the mervailes of the Grot, whereunto they were then near; but whereas
the description of it would be too long, it shall suffice to say, that it was
of an Octangular form; that although it was of a just depth, yet it was for all
that so lightsom, as all which the Orient has of most rare was there to be
seen: And to conceive a light Idea of it, one must imagine, that he beholds
together all the masterpieces, or to say better, all the miracles of Nature;
one must then figure unto himself great rocks of Crystal, of Emeraulds, and
of Rubies, where there was seen in some of them, that the Sun had not leisure
to finish his work, being without color in diverse parts; one must also paint
forth to his imagination that wonderful ennamell of Oriental Shells, whereof
the diversity is so agreeable, be it for their forms, or for their lively
colors, so well mingled, and so well sorted, that of all natural things they
are the fairest, and most perfect; one must likewise conceive that in his mind,
which all the Painters cannot represent, I mean those great Conques of Nacre,
where the beams of the Sun leave so beautiful an impression of their light,
as neither Opales, nor the Rainbow have any colors that are not surpassed by
the luminous Argent whereof they are formed, and which makes me name them with
reason the favorites of the Sun. But after all these things one must imagine
yet an infinite number of great branches of Corrall, of all colors which
Nature has produced, namely of all the Carnations, white, black, and of the
color of fire. There must be further added to all these mervailes the fairest
congelations, and the rarest petrifications, whereof Philosophers, or
Historians have ever spoken to us: After this, I say, one may conceive part of
those things which Doria beheld in this Grot, where all the artifices of
water were seen admirably well executed; there was a fall which ran from a
rock of Crystal, and which lost it self presently under another, whereof the
noise was so charming, as there is not a heart so light, nor a humor so
sullen, in whom this murmr would not have excited a pleasing fancy; and
that there may no doubt be made of the agreeableness of this enchanted Grot, I
will say no more, but that Jbrahim himself, howsoever he was pressed by his
passion, could not choose but be surprised by a thought of Isabella, which gave
Doria the more leisure to see all that I have spoken of, and a thousand other
rare things, which would be too long to relate. At last, after Doria had cried
out an hundred times miracles, miracles, and that Ibrahim wa^ come out of his
amorous contemplation, they went out of the Grot to return to the Palace, but
still Doria looked to the place from whence they were parted, and his
imagination was so taken up with that he had seen, as he was at the Round
before he ever thought of considering the front of the Palace on that side; he
saw then that it was wholly like the other, unless it were for a Balcone, which
projected from the rest of the work, and whereof the Balisters were of Copper
gilt. Having seen this they re-entred into the Palace, and ascended by a great
stair of white and red Marble, that had a rail and balister of the same; at the
top they found a Lobby, whose seeling and walls were adorned with an Arabesque
of Gold and Azure, inlayed with little pieces of Crystal, like to Mosaique
work, which yielded both a goodly and magnificent object. From thence they went
into a spacicus Gallery, which was on the right wing of the Palace, where
Ibrahim had made a Library of all the curious Books of the Oriental Languages,
and of all the choicest and rarest in the Greek, Latin, Spanish, and Italian;
but whereas the grand Vizier did always join magnificence to curiosity, all
his Books were bound up in plates of Gold, enammelled with white and green, and
placed in order upon shelves of Ebony, which were bordered with a dentile of
Goldsmiths-work, enammeled with the same colors. There were also in this
Gallery between the windows a great number of Maps, both universal and
particular; and upon a Tablet over the Books a many of Globes and Spheres,
different from one another, according to the diverse opinions of all them which
have treated of such matters. In the same order likewise he had placed all
sorts of Mathematical instruments, the fairest and the best made that ever
were seen; as concave Mirrors, Clocks, Olomestres, Circles of proportion, and
Astrolabes. But whereas Ibrahim contented not himself with necessary things,
but would also have those that were for delight, he had there a number of those
paintings, which by opticall reasons do make such excellent and charming
illusions; for that purpose then he had Cilinders of several greatnesses, and
to refresh the sight of them which read, he had of those Crystal Triangles,
which by the effect of a marvailous reflection do take and give all at one time
the colors of the Rainbow to all the objects that are seen through them. He
had also diverse magnificent Desks, Prospective-glasses, and before the middle
window a Table of Ebony, garnished with Gold, and enammeled as the shelves,
with a Standish upon it covered all over with Emeraulds, some dark, some clear,
which made a foliage admirably well represented. At the end of this Gallery
that looked upon the first Court, was a door which opened to the Terrace,
whereof I have spoken, and which answered to the Paviglion in the middle, where
the Grand Vizier had made a Cabinet of Arms, which he would needs have his dear
friend to see; he led him then by the way which I have noted, but Doria at his
entrance into it was exceedingly amazed and surprised; for the very first
object that his eye met withal, was a Trophy of Arms, sustained in the air by
the prodigious virtue of a great Adamant, which was the Key-stone of the roof
of this Cabinet, wherein were seen together, and in order, all the different
Arms, both ancient and modern, of all the Nations of the World; but so fair, so
magnificent, and so enriched, each one according to its use, as one would have
said, that they were the Master-peeces of all the excellent Artisans that ever
wrought in Arms: But amongst the rest those of Persia were the richest, and
most sumptuous; all the Scymitars had their Hilts and Scabberds of Gold, all
covered over with precious stones; and whereas that Country does abound with
Turq^eyses, there were Targets and Quivers set all over with them, and Bows and
Arrows answerable to the glittering beauty thereof. Now though the sight of all
these things were wonderfully pleasing to Doria, yet gave he over beholding
them, as soon as Ibrahim showed him three Harquebuses of a miraculous artifice;
whereof the first, which he caused him to make trial of, shot off without
fire, by the means of an enclosed wind which coming to issue forth expelled the
bullet with the like impetuosity; the second performed the same thing with
water; and the third, but the most mavelous, by the means of that powder
which is called white, shot off, not only without fire, but also without
noise. If Doria had follovved his humor, he would have stayed a long time in
Philosophying on all these secrets, by maintaining, that neither water nor
vvind, could ever have the same activity with fire, and so by consequence that
which he savv could not be without enchantment; but Ibrahim told him they
would speak of it at leisure during the voyage they were going to make, and
without harkening to him further, he made him go forth at a door opposite to
that whereby they had entered, and which gave upon the same Terrace that
ansvvered to the end of the Gallery on the left vving, where the Illustrious
Bassa had caused all the Turkish Emperors to be drawn, from Othoman, who
was the first, to Soliman then reigning. But whereas he was not contented with
having their faces represented, but would have the Othoman History also
painted, there was in this Gallery fourteen great Tables, in each of which was
an Emperor as big as the life, and within the same frame all the principal
actions of his Reign; but the same so well done so distinctly, and so well
ordered, as Doria was ravished therewith, and plainly swore to Ibrahim, that he
would not stir out of that Gallery till he had considered all these Pictures
attentively, and that he had expounded them unto him. The Bassa declined it as
much as he could, but at length seeing his friend persist in his obstinate
curiosity, he resolved to satisfy him, upon condition nevertheless, that he
should not stand to particularize all that he saw in those Tables: And when as
Doria had showed him that he was contented therewith, he requested him to
pardon him, if in the prosecution of those painted Histories he saw a number of
victories gained over the Christians, which much against his mind he had
suffered to be there, but that in the end he durst do no otherwise. This said,
making use of an Indian Cane, which he ordinarily carried in his hand, the
better to make Doria observe what he was going to show him, he began to speak
in these terms.

The Pourtrait of Othoman the first Emperor of the TURKS.
YOu see, my dear Doria, in this first Table, which you shall not see above
once again in all the rest, I mean a Prince repleat with all virtues, and
absolutely exempted from all vices, who ovved his fortune to his own proper
valor, and who alone laid the foundations of this great Empire: And indeed
his memory has been so reverenced, that even to this day all his Successors
have held it for a glory to carry his name. You may observe in his Physiogminy
that he was a Prince as prudent, as the rest of the Table will show him to
be courageous. This battle which you see afar off, is that which he obtained
against the Teggiur of the Town of Prusia; but mark a little how the
industrious Painter has so done it, as all these figures seem to move, and
that in this disorder one may know the victorious party; he has done it so
too, that Othoman is easily discerned there: But if this sight be well
represented, this assault of that Town of Prusia, and where he afterward
established the seat of his Empire, will not seem less mavelous unto you. This
pane of the wall, which you see fallen down, and which lets you perceive them
plainly that defended it, is it not admirably well done? These other Towns
which you behold so distinctly, are those of Sinopa in Galatia, of Angauri in
Phrigia, of Sebasta in Capadocia; and these which you see further off toward
those Rocks, are the rest which he gained on Mare major. As for this Land-skip,
set thick with Towns, which you see beyond Prusia, it is of Natolia, that he
wholly conquered; and this Army which seems to march, and whereof all the
soldiers are laden with booty, is the first that ever passed into Europe, and
that made strange havoc under this excellent enemy. But without staying to
consider the rest, let us pass on to this other Table.

The Pourtrait of Orchan the second Emperor of the TURKS.
THis Prince was the truly worthy son of Othoman, continued Ibrahim,
unfortunate nevertheless in this particular, that he was forced to be the
first, who-began to make war on his Brothers, and wholly to exclude them from
all pretension to the Empire; but if he were unhappy in this encounter, fortune
recompensed him otherwise; his conquests having extended their limits on the
one side to the Helespont, and on the other to Mare major. These Towns which
you see nearest hand, are those of Nicea, and Nicomedia; and this Army in
disorder, where the Painter has so well represented fear and amazement, is
that of the Emperor Paleologue, which was routed by Orchan near to Philocratia,
as you may discern afar off. As for this great extent of Country, and this
number of Towns, which take up all the rest of the Table, it is Misia,
Lacaonia, Caria, and Phrigia, except the Towns of Gallipolis, and Philopoli,
which you see on the right hand, and which were his last conquests, for he died
soon after. But let us behold the next.

The Pourtrait of Soliman the third Emperor of the Turks.
IF the life of this Emperor had been longer, he would have yet surpassed his
Father, both in valor, and in prudence, and we should have seen the Table of
his victories filled up more than it is; but whereas his reign endured but two
years, he had no more time than to take Andri^ople, conquer a great part of
Thrace, and bring also under his subjection the Towns of Pergamas, Edrenuta,
Zemeniqua, and some others, as well on this, as on the other side of the
Helespout, which you see here running athwart this Table. But this other piece
will furnish us with more matter to speak of than this same.

The Pourtrait of Amurath the fourth Emperor of the Turks.
TO describe unto you the humor of this Prince, before I speak of his Triumphs,
I must tell you that he had together both force and weakness, courtesy and
cruelty, and agility in his age; that he was both terrible and loving; that he
was insatiable in shedding of blood, and that nevertheless he never put any one
to death but most justly. It was as well by these according contrarieties that
he rendered himself admirable to Posterity, as by his valor, which being
seconded by fortune ma^e him take Pherea, the capital City of Macedonia,
conquer Misia from Dragus, and Mount Rhodope from the Pogdan, two valiant and
mighty Princes, and the most part of Armenia from the Greek Emperor. Carathin a
great Captain, conquered for him also the Towns of Cherales, Seres, Marolia,
and the renowned Thessalonica, which the Painter has made to be seen more
distinctly, than those I have already showed you, as being of more importance.
Doria could not then forbear interrupting Ibrahim, for to pray him to let him
know whether those millions of armed and fighting men which he saw in this
Table, were not the picture of all the Battles that were given during the
reigns of all the Emperors. You have reason my dear Doria, answered the
Illustrious Bassa, to be amazed at the prodigious number of men which this
Table does show you, where the Art of the Painter has as well eternized his
own glory, as that of Amurath, by representing seven and thirty battles which
he won: And that which is yet more mavelous therein is, that he died
triumphing in the last. See you not, continued Ibrahim, this Army discomfited?
And this great heap of arms in the midst of the place of battle, upon the
which a dead man appears, holding nevertheless a scymitar still in his hand,
and upon whom Victory, which you may see here represented in the air, throws
down Crowns; it is the body of Victorious Amurath, whose death was worthy of
envy, and whose life would have defaced the glory of all them that preceded
him, had it not been blemished with cruelty: But if the death of Amurath
deserved to be envyed, that of Bajazet will give you cause of pity.

The Pourtrait of Bajazet, the fifth Emperor of the TURKS.
THe nature of this prince cannot be well represented but by the lightning,
which terrifieth universally, which ravageth indifferently, passes in a
momant, and perishes in an instant; all of them qualities admirably befitting
Bajazet, surnamed by his subjects Guilderum, that is to say, the lightning of
Heaven. But whereas the remembrance of his life strikes me with horror, by
reason of the unheard of cruelties which he exercised, it shall suffice to tell
you, that after he had gotten some battles, which you see presented in this
Table, taken the Town of Eritza, and those of Hisipolis, Iconium, Casura,
Migdia, and Assara from the Caraman; and gained also by arms from a Greek,
named Theodorus, the Town of Damacia, and that of Delphos, which you see here
near hand; after he had, I say, sacked all Hungaria, Bossina, and Croatia;
defeated the French, Burgingnians, and Hungarians, in that memorable battle of
Nicopolis; after he had, I say, filled the whole Universe with terror, put all
the Provinces where he passed to fire and sword, he lost in one only battle
his Empire, and his glory, serving Tamerlan, who had vanquished him, all the
rest of his days; and at last was constrained, for his geting out of misery,
to make his tomb of his prison, by beating out his brains as against the iron
bars of the cage, wherein he was enclosed; An action so strange, it is
impossible not to be moved with it. But let us see how the eldest of his
children began to reestablish the disorders of his father.

The Pourtrait of Iosue, the sixth Emperor of the TURKS.
IT is easier to conquer, than to reestablish; to increase ones felicity, than
to retire from a misfortune; of a petty Sovereign to become a mighty Monarch,
than to remount into a Throne from whence one is descended. It is no little
glory to Josue, after the utter dissipation of his fathers Sat, to have been
the first in raising up again that mighty Empire, by regaining from Tamerlan
the City of Prusia, which you have already seen, as having been before the
chief seat of their Empire, and very near all that his Predecessors had
possessed in Asia. He did the like in Europe, as you may see in this Table; and
when he was returned into Asia, his brother Musulman, fortified with the succor
of the Greeks, incountred him in Cappadocia, gave him battle, which he w^n,
and taking him prisoner caused him to be strangled, after he had reigned four
years. But this cruelty was repaid unto him, as you will quickly understand.

The Pourtrait of Musulman, the seventh Emperor of the TURKS.
ALthough that Musulman showed himself exceedingly courageous before he
vanquished his brother, yet shall you see but two battles in this Table: That
which you see a far off is the same, whereof I have spoken; and the other which
you see near hand, is one that he obtained against a brother of his, called
Moses, who had established himself in Greece: And truly the History does
declare, that Musulman did in his own person perform miracles at that battle,
whereof he had all the glory, and all the advantage; but as soon as he saw that
he was peaceable in his State, he abandoned himself in such sort to
voluptuousness, as he became more cowardly, than he was valiant before, so that
Moses having rallied his forces, which were dispersed by his deafeat, gave
battle again to Musulman, who shamefully fled, was taken, and brought to his
brother, that quickly revenged the death of Josue by taking away his life. But
let us behold the sequel of the History of this third Son of Bajazet, which
will not be long.

The Pourtrait of Moses, the eighth Emperor of the TURKS.
Moses having reigned but three years, you may not expect the sight of many
conquests, in this Table; all that he could do was to give some rest unto
Asia, to spoil the Country of the Bulgarians, take the Town of Spenderovia,
reduce the Pogdan to his obedience, and win the battle which his Nephew Mahomet
presented him with, who not long after rallied his forces, and came upon him
with a fresh charge, where Moses had the worst, by being abandoned of his
Soldiers in this sight, so that he was taken in a marish with one of his hands
cut off, whereof they soon cured him by putting him to death. Now though this
Table be not much filled, yet certainly it is none of the meanest; the colors
of it are so Vive, the digesting of it so beautiful, this order of the
Architecture so well understood, as it may be said in viewing this piece, that
the art of the Painter has supplied the defect of the matter.

The Pourtrait of Mahomet the ninth Emperor of the TURKS.
AT length after so many Losses, Captivities, Sackings, Massacres, Fratricides,
and civil dissentions, the Turkish Empire began to reassume its ancient luster
under the conduct of Mahomet, who after he had repulsed all them that had
atttacqued him, conquered Pontus, Cappadocia, and all those other Provinces,
which the Painter has so well represented a far off; his arms were also
victorious in diverse incounters under the leading of Amurath his Eldest son.
Mahomet subdued likewise Servia, Valachia, a great part of Sclavonia, and
Macedonia; chaced all the petty Kings out of the lesser Asia to establish a
Beglierbey there, which is as much to say, as a Viceroy; at last, after he had
performed a thousand brave exploits, for a recompense of his virtue, he reigned
a long time, and dyed peaceably in his State of a natural death, exceedingly
regretted of all his Subjects. But before we pass on I must cause you to mark
one address of the Painter, that peradventure you have not heeded, which is,
that to make one know the diversity of Provinces, and Armies, which you have
seen throughout all these Tables, he has always observed the attire, arms,
standarts, and briefly all the particular things of every Nation: After this
advertisement the rest of these pieces will give you more contentment yet, than
the other have done. Let us see then, whether Amurath was the worthy successor
of his father.

The Pourtrait of Amurath the second, the tenth Emperor of the TURKS.
THe Physiognimy of this Prince is not deceiving, and although it does promise
us much, we shall yet find more: After then that this Prince had defeated
Mustapha, the last son of Bajazet, whom the Greeks had made to rise up
against him, as also another Mustapha his brother, whom the same Greeks had
likewise protected, he turned the fury of his arms against them; taking from
them the City of Thessalonica, which the Painter has represented unto us as
fair as the Historians have described it, and whereof the perspective is so
mavelous, as one has much ado to believe that the running in of this gate
is not effective. But let us return to the Victories of this Prince, who
spoiled the higher Misia, took the Town of Senderovia, conquered the Countries
of Sarmian, and of Sarcan, two mighty Princes of the less Asia, and the Town
of Coni from the Caraman: The Hungarians having in the mean time broken the
peace which they had contracted with him, he returned into Europe, and was so
fortunate, that the Christian Galleys, which lay at the straight of Helespont
to hinder his passage, were constrained by foul weather to retire; he in the
mean while came to that memorable plain, which gave name to the famousest
battle that ever was heard spoken of. And see you not how the Painter has been
pleased to represent it? Mark this Squadron a little which gives ground, and
this other which is broken; consider the left wing which is routed; observe
this close Battalion, which is going to attacque this other that is ready to
fly: As for the body of the Battle, where you see so great a disorder, and
such a confusion of dead horses, men overthrown, blood spilt, and arms broken,
it is here in this place, where the Painter would represent the death of
Ladislaus, which arrived in this battle, with the loss very near of all the
Nobility of Hungary; some fighting to revenge the death of their Prince, and
others to recover his body; but to show clearly that the victory was on
Amuraths side, the Painter has represented Renown, which seems to fly over
his Troops for to advertise them of it. Howbeit not to stand longer hereupon,
it shall suffice to say, that after the battle of Varnes he conquered
Peloponnesus; that he dismissed himself absolutely from his Empire, which to
took upon him again soon after, for to obtain a battle against the valiant
Huniades; he made the King of Bosnia also his Tributary, which was his last
victory: For the courageous George Scanderbeg Castriot, King of Albania, who
had been his Slave, and that had acquired unto himself with so much justice the
glorious title of the Buckler of Christendom, oposed all his enterprises with
such valor, as this great Prince, seeing him self forced so raise his siege
from before Croya, dyed with grief and spite at it.

The Pourtrait of Mahomet the second, the eleventh Emperor of the Turks.
IT was not without some cause that this Prince would be surnamed Bovi, which
is to say, Great, or the Terror of the World, seeing all his actions have been
so great, and high, that if his excellent qualities had been without blemish,
this Prince had been incomparable. He was great in his enterprises, great in
courage, great in conduct, great in prudence, a great Politician, great in
conquest, great in beauty, and in subtilty of wit; but he was also great in
impiety, in dissoluteness, in revenge, in perfidiousness, and in ambition. The
greatness of his courage, and of his enterprises, carried him against the
Greeks, Hungarians, Trebisondians, Mifians, Valachians, Transilvanians,
Bosniaus, Albanians, Rhodians, Venetians, and diverse other people. In
conclusion, my dear Doria, this Prince had to do with all the Warlike Nations
of the World; but this Table contains too many things to be explaned
particularly unto you, wherefore it shall suffice, that you only do admire the
exquisite ordering of it, and that I tell you in general, how Mahomet
conquered, in two and thirty years that he reigned, twelve Kingdoms, and two
Empires, that of Trebisond, and that of the Greeks, together with this mighty
and renowned City of Constantinople; as also that of Croya, and all Albania,
Valachia, Bosnia, Scodra, Peloponesus, and the Town of Otranto. He reduced the
Caraman under his obedience, Stiria, Carinthia, Synope, the Island of Metelin;
and after the battle which he gained against Usuncassan, he constrained him to
seek his amity. Howbeit he was not equally fortunate, for the valiant Huniades,
and the valorous Scanderbeg, vanquished sometimes in him the Vanquisher of all
others. And whereas ambition was the predominant passion in the heart of
Mahomet, it followed him even to death, ordaining that upon his Tomb there
should be set, after a long narration of all his Victories, in the Turkish
tongue, this subscription in Latin,

He had a purpose to ruin Rhodes, and superb Italy.
But the divine justice extinguished his desires with his days.

The Pourtrait of Bajazet the second, the twelfth Emperor of the Turks.
THe life of this Prince is so replenished with diverse adventures, as it cannot
be defined certainly, whether he had more good than bad fortune. The beginning
of his Reign was established by three Battles which he obtained against a
Brother of his, who was constrained to fly unto Rhodes. When he was at peace he
conquered Caramania, did great spoil in Moldavia, took the Town of Chilliem,
together with the Castle, and that of Moncastro, the chief of the Province; he
took also Lepanto, Modon, Coron, and Junqua from the Christians, whom he
defeated i^ a Navall-fight, as you may behold in this Table, where the Painter
verily has done prodigies. See you not, continued Ibrahim, these two vessels
grapled together? consider a little with what ardour the assailants seem to go
to the fight, and how one of these Janissaries striving to leap aboard this
small vessel is repulsed by this Christian, how in falling he has seized on
his enemy, whom he drags along with him. Behold also on the left hand this
vessel, which the Turks had invested, and how that rather than they would
yield, they have blown up themselves; observe withal these flakes of fire,
which light upon this other vessel, whose tackle and sails already begin to
burn; and how this great cloud of smoke, which steals away the rest of the Army
from our eyes, is an address of the Painter, who wanting room has repaired
that defect by this invention. But without standing on the last disorders of
this Prince, which were strange, whether for the violent deaths that he caused,
or for that which he received, let us pass on to thi^ other piece.

The Pourtrait of Selim, the thirteenth Emperor of the Turks.
THis gloomy physiognomy, and this haughty look, do not ill paint forth unto,
us the ambition and cruelty of Selim, but they conceal from us his virtues
which certainly were very great. He was prudent, and advised amidst dangers,
prompt and vigilant in his enterprises, indefatigable in War, of an invincible
courage, a reasonable Justicer manger his cruelty, extremely liberal; and that
which is of most marvail in this Prince is, that he was never vanquished after
he was Emperor. He loved the reading of History, he made verses in his own
tongue, was very skillful in Painting, and even to the point, that he sent, as
I have already delared, the Battle which he obtained against the Sophy, drawn
with his own hand, unto the Venetians, who conserve it still unto this day in
their Treasury. There is also a great number of his works to be seen in the
Seraglio: He was very Eloquent, and nothing curious of the magnificence of
Apparel; and that which I most admire in him, is, that he always refused
those adorations which are accustomed to be rendered to the Turkish Emperors,
never suffering any to cast themselves on the ground in speaking to him, nor to
do him reverence on their knees. And truly if this Emperor had not blemished
his glory by that prodigious desire of reigning, which carried him to take away
the life of him, from whom he had received his; to cause two of his Brothers,
eight of his Nephews, and as many of his Bassaes to be strangled, he had been
excellent in all things. But to pass over his Victories lightly, because time
does press us, I will only tell you in few words, that he won a famous Battle
of the Sophy at Zaleran; that he took Tauris, which he kept not long; and Keman
at his return; he rendered himself Master of Aladulia, after he had vanquished
King Ustagelu; he passed into Siria, where he defeated Campson Gauri, Sultan of
Cairo, in a battle near to Aleppo, which was rendered unto him, as well as
Damascus, and all the rest of Siria; from thence going to Jerusalem, he
conquered all Palestina by the valor of Sinan Bassa, who obtained a Battle
near to Gaza; whereupon Selim, having passed the deserts of Egypt, fought a
battle with Thomombey hard by Matharea, and constrained him to retire to
Cairo, where was given the most memorable battle of our Age, for it lasted
three days and three nights in continual fight; but in the end Selim was
victorious, and forced the Mamelucks to abandon the City unto him; and having
recovered new forces, they were utterly defeated, and Thomombey taken prisoner.
After he had given the pillage of Cairo to his soldiers, as you may see in
this Table, where this dreadful disorder is so well expressed, he went and took
also Alexandria, Dan^ietta, Tripoli, and all the rest of Egypt and Arabia: One
of his Bassaes obtained likewise a great Victory against the Persians. But at
last, after he had been in so many fights, won so many battails, and conquered
so many Provinces, in less than two years, as he thought to return triumphant
to the seat of his Empire, he dyed at Chiourli, in the very same place where
before he had given battle to his father, after he had reigned only eight years.

The Pourtrait of Soliman the second, the fourteenth Emperor of the Turks.
THe Victories of great Soliman are so universally known of all the World, that
upon the least considering of this Table, you will bring them unto your memory
again, it being impossible but that fame has acquainted you with them: You
will easily then know Belgrade and the Isle of Rhodes, where this Emperor
stood in need of all his conduct, and of all his valor. This Battle which you
see a far off, is that of Mohacs which he gained against the Hungarians,
wherein dyed Lewis King of Hungary. This City, which here I show you (continued
Ibrahim) is Bagadet, where Soliman was crowned King of Persia; but though I
have some share in this War, as well as in that of Natolia, which you may see
also in this Table, I will refer this narration to another time, that may be
more opportune for us. I know, my dear Doria, that this proposition displeases
you, but you must obey me, for you will not be the strongest at
Constantinople; and though you may absolutely command Justiniano, yet must you
at this time follovv the pleasure of Ibrahim. Let us make an end then of
running over the Victories of Soliman again, and without particularising every
one, it shall suffice me to tell you, that Assyria, and Mesopotamia do obey
him; that he has taken Strigonia, and Alba Regalis; that he has made six
expeditions into Hungary; that he has subdued Aladulia, and the Kingdom of
Aden, with many other Towns on the red sea; that he has rendered Argier
Tributary; that he has also subjected Pialli, Tripoli, and Gerbes: But after
all these things, that which I find to be most excellent in the life of this
Prince is, that he conquered a Kingdom for to restore it unto him to whom it
appertained, by rendering unto him again all the strong places that he had in
his hands, which he performed in the person of John King of Hungary; and I more
esteem of him for having surmounted this ambition, which is natural to all
Monarchs, than I commend him for all his Victories: And whereas I make more
account of the gifts of Nature than of the presents of Fortune, I had rather
make you an Elogium of his person in particular, than speak further to you of
his Conquests, which are already but too great on Christendom side. Behold
then, my dear Doria, this Majesticall face, and this virtuous physiognomy; did
you ever see a more goodly man? or one of a better aspect? There appears in his
eyes a vivacity of spirit, and a sweetness which charmeth hearts, and in the
air of his face a certain tranquillity, which sufficiently shows that this
Prince is master of his passions, and that without doubt he has no interior
trouble; I know not whether my affection to him does blind or dazzle me, but I
see something of such state in his port, and of so much majesty over all his
person, as I hold it impossible for one to look upon him, and not to love him:
Furthermore this goodly appearance is not deceitful, and the qualities of this
Princes soul are so noble and virtuous, that if he were a Christian he would be
of all men the most perfect. He has together, both much valor, and much
conduct; he is infinitely just toward his own people, and exceeding clement
toward his enemies; he is so rigorous an observer of his word, as he would
resolve rather to lose his Empire, than not to keep it, when once he has given
it: He is great in spirit, great in judgment, and great in memory; he
understands the Mathematics, and the universal History, so admirably, as
nothing can be propounded to him to^^hing those matters which he resolves not
upon the place. Finally, he is a Prince that possesses all virtues, and that
has never been vanquished save by one only passion; but whereas it is the
noblest of all others, I think you will pardon him this weakness; he has been
then passionately amorous of diverse women, but amongst the rest of the Sultana
Roxelana, whom he would needs espouse, to the end she might partake with him in
that supreme greatness which the Othoman Princes do not lightly bestow, and
which to conserve wholly to themselves, they never, or seldom marry; howbeit
love was stronger in Soliman, than either reason of State, or the example of
his Predecessors. Behold, my dear Doria, a simple draught of this great
Emperor, whom ere it be long you may compare with the original, that so you
may judge, whether I have robbed him of any thing, or flattered him; for this
great Prince has commanded me to bring you to the Seraglio, when as I go
thither to take my leave of him; in the mean space, since we are pressed with
time, let us make an end of viewing this house.

In saying so, Ibrahim opened a door, which gave upon the Lobbey, whereof I
have already spoken, but before they past on, Doria testified to Ibrahim how
glad he was of the hope he had given him that he should present himself to the
Grand Signior; he rendered him thanks also for having so punctually explaned all
those pieces, by abridging unto him the History of so great an Empire, which he
had never understood but very confusedly before. He would have said more, if
our illustrious Bassa would have suffered him, but his impatience appeared so
visibly in his eyes, that Doria without further stay went out of the Gallery
smiling into the Lobbey, from whence they past through three outward chambers,
which were all of a floor, before they came to Ibrahims: the feeling of them
were very magnificent, and the meanest of the Hangings were of cloth of Gold,
of Tinsell, or Persian Tapestry; the floors, as of all the rest, were made of
suitable pieces of several Marbles, and in proportionable divisions. After he
had stayed a while to consider all these things, they entered into the Bassaes
chamber, where Doria was surprised with the furniture of it, both for the
richness, and fashion thereof; for it was hanged with black Velvet, set all
over with tears and flames imbroidered in pearl: Here it was where Ibrahim
desired his dear Doria to remember the things which he should see in this
chamber, more particularly than all the rest of the Palace, to the end he might
testify to the incomparable Isabella, that she had always reigned in his
heart, and that to conserve the memory of her, he would never open his eyes in
waking, without beholding some marks of his love; he caused him then to
observe, that in the feeling of this chamber were five great Ovals, in each of
which was a Table, and between every of them hung festons of flowers and
fruits, all gilt; the rest of the feeling being done with cornishments, whereof
some were of azure, some of burnished gold. In the middle piece, which was
greater than the rest, was a woman represented, whom Doria presently knew,
because she had something of Isabella in her, although it was a very imperfect
resemblance; for Ibrahim having lost her picture, could do no more but instruct
the Painter with the color of her hair, with the form of her face, with all
the features of it in particular, with the vivacity of her complexion, with her
stature, and with her bosom; for as for the air and gracefulness, which cannot
be expressed, but in calling it the soul of beauty, it is a thing that cannot
pass from our imagination to that of another, and that consequently did not
permit Ibrahim's Painter to make any mavelous picture of Isabella; but in
conclusion it was resembling enough for to cause them, who knew her, to judge
that she was thought of when this piece was made. This imperfect resemblance
having entertained them a while, Doria considered all this Table, and saw (as I
have already declared) a woman sumptuously apparelled, who trampled under her
feet honor, virtue, and love, which were seen represented with the marks
whereby they are known; and that with her right hand, lifted up on high, she
took from fortune, who appeared over her in the air, a little Crown, which she
seemed to receive very contentedly, with this Motto, All for her. Doria easily
comprehended this Emblem, and no way doubted, but that the Bassa had caused it
to be made out of the opinion he had, that Isabella had despised her love, her
promises, and her constancy, to espouse the Prince of Masseran, who was but a
petty Sovereign. After he had commended the art of the Painter, and the
invention of the design, the Bassa leading him toward one of the corners of
the chamber, the better to view the second Ovall, demanded of him whether this
other Table would be as intelligible to him as the first? Doria approaching to
it, and considering it, beheld a Love, in whose face choler and fury were so
well painted, as it was easy to imagine that he himself had burst his bow,
broken his arrows, thrown away his quiver, and torn his head-band, which were
seen scattered about him; and that which better expressed his despair, was,
that having nothing left him of all the marks of his Divinity but his torch, he
plunged it, all flaming as it was, into a fountain to extinguish it, with this
Motto, I cannot. Doria was so ravished with this Table, as he could not
forbear considering all the beauties of it, and whereas the explication of it
was easy, he told the Bassa, that he would pardon him for that he would
have extinguished so fair a fire as that vvherevvith he was inflamed, at such
a time as he thought it to be unjust, but that he held him happy for that he
could not do it, and for having conserved a flame, which he could not put out
without a crime: After this he admired the Art of the Painter, and principally
of the torch, which this Love plunged into the fountain, where the excellent
Workman had so well represented that natural antipathy betwixt water and
fire, as never did any one behold a thing better imitated: This fountain seemed
to boil with choler to see her enemy so near her; and this flame desiring to
eloign it self from that which would destroy it, seemed exceedingly to strive
to get from it, and rising up on high in wreathing about the torch, melted so
great a quantity of wax, as all the fountain seemed to be covered over with
it. Ibrahim not suffering Doria to admire this piece any longer, constrained
him to look upon the third, desiring him howsoever not to bestovv much time in
it, because that Table did outrage Isabella, as well as another which he
should see afterward: He shevved him then the same woman he had seen before,
but in a different habit; for here the Painter had given her a robe of
changeable Taffeta, where all colors reigned equally; this woman was on the
brink of the Sea, the agitation whereof she beheld with delight; in one hand
she held a Crescent, with the other she seemed to point at a Camelion, which
was at her feet, and that leaning his body on a part of her robe had assumed
all the colors of it; the rest of that creature was grayish like to the earth
vvhereon it stood, with this Motto, Yet more.

After that Doria had seen this piece, he told the Bassa, that he had reason to
say it did outrage Isabella, in accusing her of inconstancy, but since this
crime had been committed through the malice of fortune, he should one day
obtain his grace for it: This said, they passed to the other end of the
chamber, and beheld in the fourth Table, a proper man, and of a good aspect,
that seemed very sad; he had on the one side the same Isabella, whom they had
seen before, and on the other, death, with this Motto, The one, or the other.

Now although this piece was admirably well done, yet would not Doria stay to
consider it, but only told the Bassa, that the noble despair which he had
shevved in this Table, rendered him vvorhy to be put, at his return to Genoua,
into the possession of an happiness, which he could never lose again but by
death alone; howbeit in the mean time he was most assured, that albeit this
picture did not fill the imaginination with a fair Idea, yet would it be more
pleasing to Isabella, than that other, where the Painter had given her a roab
of all the colors of the Rain-bovv. The Bassa then pushing him to the other
side of the chamber, told him, that this, which he was now going to show
him, would not like enough please her ere a whit more, if she had not the
goodness to consider, that his love had howsoever been so strong, as to make
him conserve with some delight the very marks of her contempt, and
inconstancy, which he had believed to be true; he caused Doria then to behold
the last picture of this seeling. It was a Land-skip, where the Princes was
seen again holding an heart in her hand, that was all of a flame, and not far
from her a great fire of straw, where the Painter had so well imitated
nature, as it was easy to perceive, that how vive soever this flame was,
yet could it not long endure: There were also flashes of lightning seen
darting at her head, with his Motto, Less durable.

Doria then accused Ibrahim of injustice, and told him, that if this piece had
been less excellent, he should hardly have pardoned him the wrong he did
Isabella, but he was so ravished to see those vvaving flames, vvvhich came out
of a cloud, and that spread themselves over all the piece, leaving an
impression of fire and light, which seemed even to redouble, and lessen, as if
the cloud had opened, and shut i^ self, that he ceased to accuse him, for to
praise the Painter, which he did with so ^uch aggregation, as Ibrahim was
constrained to urge him more than once to view a picture, which he had caused
to be set over his Chimney: Now he had no sooner cast his eye upon it, but he
vowed it was the best of them all; the ordering of it was rare, the design
extraordinary and new, the colors most agreeable, the prospective excellent;
in conclusion this Table was drawn with so bold an hand, as it might well be
called a Masterpiece of this art. A rock was seen there in the midst of an
enraged Sea, which the Painter had done so well, as those foaming waves, that
brok themselves against the rock, seemed to have some motion: There was seen
also a little from thence the wrack of a Vessel, whereon the thunder fell,
which was seen to issue like a torrent of fire out of the cloud, that seemed to
rive asunder with such violence, as little lacked but that one sense deluded
did not deceive the other, in making it to imagine that it heard that, which
was seen so well represented. This mervailous Artisan had likewise so well
painted that confused mixture, which is seen in the air during a great tempest,
where rain, wind, snow, hail, flashes of lightning, and obscurity, reign all at
once, that one could not behold it without some terror: Upon the top of this
rock was an open tomb seen, whereunto a man, weary, and wet all over, advanced
in great have, holding a Love in one hand, and with the other pointing to the
to^b, with this Motto, Let us save our selves there.

You will without doubt find another sanctuary, said Doria to the illustrious
Bassa, who, answering him no otherwise than with a sigh, made him enter into
his Cabinet, the door whereof was on the right hand of the chimney, not far
from his bed, which after the custom of the Country was rolled up in a great
Persian tapestry Counterpoint of silk and gold. But if Doria had admired all
that he had seen in this Palace, he beheld with astonishment the magnificence
of this Cabinet, whereof the embowed roof and walls were enriched with a
foliage of precious stones, upon a ground of black marble, where birds,
flowers, and fruits, were seen so admirably well done, that the art surmounted
the matter, although Topazes, Jacints, Opales, Emeraulds, Rubies, Diamonds, and
Carbuncles were the colors wherewith all these things were represented. Round
about this Cabinet were shelves of Ebony, sustained by curtroses of gold, which
projected out of the wall wall by equal distances, the edges, and uper part of
these shelves, were enriched with Orpheury, enammeled only with white and
black, the better to set off those things which were upon them; but to speak
that in few words, and confusedly, which would be too long to describe in
order, one might see there Caskets of different Ambers, great Vases of
Crystal of the rock, of Cornaline, and Agate, with branches of Corrall, which
might rather be called trees, by reason of their prodigious greatness: Finally,
all that Persia, China, Japon, and all the Oriental Countries do produce of
most rare, rich, and beautiful, were found amassed together in this place.
After that Doria had said all, that admiration, and amazement can make them
say, who love, and know rarities, they repassed through the chamber, to go unto
a door that was opposite to that of the Cabinet, whereby one entered into
Ibrahims Bath, who, being accommodated with all exterior things, according to
the custom of the Country where he lived, did not fail in having a goodly and
magnificent one. It was a place spacious enough, in form Octangular, environed
about with seats, whereunto one ascended by four steps of Jasper, and
Chalcedony, whereof the two lovvermost were covered with water even up to
the brim of the third, the fourth being wholy out of the water: At each of
the eight angles was a Colum, after the Corinthian manner, of Jasper mingled
with diverse colors; the Columns were planted on the fourth step, which
served them for a pedestall, with their Bases, Capitalls, Frizes, and
Corniches; the Frize was carved in half relieve, where naked children were
seen, who seemed to combat in the water with little Sea Monsters, and to
wrestle with them, with efforts so agreeable to their years, as the workman
deserved no little glory for the same. All these figures were so lively set
forth, as they seemed to move, so easily may the imagination be deceived by
things that are well represented; over the Frize was the Cornish, and above
that just perpendicular to every Column rose up a twyning wreath of Oaken
leaves, laid one upon another, made of green Jasper, and bound with filets of
gold, mounting up on the ribbs of the vaulting, and meeting the middle in the
form of a Chaplet of Triumph. All the walls were overlaid with a compound
stone, called Aventurina, and whereof they seemed to be framed, so excellently
was this work contrived. But amongst all the beauties of the place the greatest
was, that between those eight Columns, whereof I have already spoken, there
were as many Niches, four of which were filled with great Vases of gold, that
served to lay the perfumes in, and other things necessary to the Bath; the
other four, which separated those former, were filled with four Nymphs of
white marble, so admirably fair, as Nature has never made any thing more
beautiful, than the Idea of this excellent workman: These figures were all in
different actions; some of them seemed to uncloth themselves for to enter into
the Bath; others to come out of it, putting on their clothes again; but all
with such art, as Doria confessed, that Sculpture had never showed any thing
more perfect. He considered also that the water, which was seen in the Bath,
fell into it through two Vases of Crystal, which were held by two men, laid
along on the brim of the Bath, and represented as Rivers use to to be painted:
Out of one the Vases issued hot water, and out of the other cold, to the end
one might by that mixture find that just mediocrity requisite for those that
bath. After he had seen all these things, the grand Vizier made Doria go forth
at a secret door, and pass down by a back stair to one of the doors of the
Hall; and though it be the custom of the Turks in general not to be very
costly in their diet, yet as the Grandes do not use to follow the common
fashion, so Ibrahim left not to be in that particular, as in all other things.
Doria saw in the middle of the Hall a great Persian Carpet extended on the
ground, with a Table-cloth after the manner of the Country, upon which were set
a many of silver Chargers, where in each of them were seen twelve great dishes
of that which we call the essence of porcelain, replenished with diverse sorts
of meats; for it is the custom of the Turks never to eat in any metal;
howbeit they are not without great store of silver vessel, only for
magnificence; and indeed the grand Visiers Cubbord of plate was so sumptuous,
as Europe has not a King that can show so fair a one. Doria then beholding
that prodigious amass of Basins of gold engraven, great Vases of sundry forms
and of diverse bignesses, Flaggons, water Pots, and Cisternes of gold, with
Lions muzles and Dolphins, half imbost, could not forbear telling Ibrahim that
Isabella would dye for joy, if she certainly knew at what rate he bought the
possession of her; but the Bassa returning him no other answer thereunto than a
sigh, told Doria it was time to dine, that they might afterward go and take
their leave of Soliman; that in the mean space, whereas their exterior
ceremonies were different, although their minds were not, he had given order
that he should be served in his chamber. Doria went out then of this Hall,
after he had observed, that the Persian Carpet was set all about with great
Cushions of cloth of Gold, upon Carpets of the same stuff, for Ibrahim and the
Officers of the Empire which did eat with him, to sit upon. The Bassa would
have conducted his dear Doria to his lodging, but he would not suffer him, so
that he was constrained to leave him in the hands of an Italian slave, in whom
he confided for all things. These two friends were not long at meat, for at
this time love and friendship produced the same impatiency in them both; the
Bassa came into Doriaes chamber just as he was going out, having taken a
resolution together to go immediately to the Seraglio, that they might part
away the night ensuing. The Italian slave assured the Bassa, that in the
evening he should have such an habit as Doria wore; for Ibrahim had caused him
to quit that of a slave, as soon as he was at liberty, and by the means of
those Jews, of whom I have already spoken, procured him one of the Italian
fashion. They went away then to the Seraglio, where being arrived, Ibrahim
made Doria put on a Turkish robe, no stranger being permitted to speak to the
Sultan but with this ceremony. The Bassa entered in first, to let his Highness
know, that according to his order he had brought his dear Doria; Soliman
shevved himself much satisfied therewith, howbeit though he were somewhat
impatient to see him, yet would he for all that speak once more to Ibrahim
without witnesses, wherefore he caused him to pass along with him into his
Cabinet, vvhither he was no sooner come, but looking on our illustrious Bassa
with eyes where generosity combatted grief, and retaining the tears which
kindness and amity would have shed in this hard separation, he spoke unto him
with such obliging terms, as Ibrahim was not long without partaking with him in
his melancholy, so certain it is that passions do easily pass from one spirit
to another, as well in friendship, as in love. The Sultan having observed by
the change of the Bassaes countenance, that his soul was moved, desired his
pardon for having troubled his pleasure, and accused himself of inhumanity for
not letting him part without showing his grief, to the end he might not have
excited his; but to excuse him in this encounter he was only to consider, that
the love he bare him was so strong, as he would with less pain divide with him
his Empire, than be separated from him; that nevertheless he was generous
enough not to repent him of the grace which he had granted him, albeit the
execution of it was more difficult than he had thought it to be; but to comfort
him in his absence, he prayed him not to take it ill, if he desired one oath
more from him, which might assure him he would within six months return to
Constantinople. Soliman had no sooner done speaking, but the Grand Vizier, who
never gave place to any man in generosity, cast himself at his feet, and
protested unto him, that he would not depart before his Highness had testified
that he would rely on the word he had given him to return precisely with in the
time prefixed; that he esteemed himself very unhappy in not being known to his
Highness for that which he was, and that being neither base, ungrateful, nor a
liar, he was for all that suspected of those three crimes by a Prince, for
whom he would sacrifice his life with joy, who reigned in his heart far more
absolutely, than over his people, and who touched his soul with so much
tenderness, as he plainly felt that he could not turn his steps toward
Isabella, without turning his eyes toward Soliman. Ibrahim pronounced these
last words with such earnestness, as the Sultan no way doubted but that he had
truly expressed his heart; he raised him up then in embracing him, and promised
him that he would live in some quiet of this assurance of seeing him again;
that in the mean time it was not just to let Doria stay any longer without, and
that therefore he should go and fetch him in. Ibrahim obeying this
commandment, called him at the door of the Cabinet; as soon as he appeared
Soliman spoke to him in his own language, for, as I have already said, this
Prince understood it perfectly, and made him such an Elogium of our Illustrious
Bassa, as caused him to blush more than once; he spoke of his valor, of his
prudence, and of his conduct in great matters; finally he assured him, that he
was as good a General of an Army, as he was a good and faithful friend; he
told him further, that he desired him to receive his friendship, as he already
possessed his, having begun to love him as soon as Ibrahim had made known to
him, by the recital of his adventures, what his merit was, and the affection
which he bore him; moreover, that as all the interests of Ibrahim were his, so
he gave him thanks not only for all the services he had rendered him, but for
all those which he should render him in time to come; and for a mark of the
obligation wherein he would stand engaged to him for it, he conjured him to
accept of a Scymitar which he gave him, whereof the hilt and scabberd were all
covered over with Diamonds. Doria answered to all these things with all the
respect that he owed to so great a Prince, and being fallen on his knees to
receive that precious gage of Solimans liberality, he was with a great deal of
sweetness and civility taken up by the Sultan, who prayed him to assure
Isabella, that the constancy of her Justiniano had been so firm during the time
that he believed her to be unfaithful, as he durst swear for him, that he had
never sought after, nor affected glory, but out of the hope of dying more
nobly; he entreated him also to present her from him with a box of Gold, set
with Emeraulds, which was filled with two Chains, the first was of Diamonds of
an excessive greatness, and the second of Pearls, so big, so round, so even,
and so clear, that the Orient has never showed us fairer. Ibrahim would have
spoken to render Soliman thanks, and to have made himself the bearer of that
Treasure, but he imposed silence on him, and said, that it would be enongh for
him to entertain Isabella with his own affairs, without charging himself with a
complement from another. But at last the Sultan being unwilling that Doria
should see him capable of any weakness, and feeling that this conversation
could not long endure without his falling again into melancholy, he told the
Bassa that he had given order unto the Tesqueregibassi, who is the Grand
Signiors principal Secretary, to make up the Ambassador of Genouaes dispatch;
that his Letter was conceived in such pressing terms, as that Republique durst
not refuse what he desired of it; that in the mean time, since he must resolve
to see him depart, he thought it fit that he should go and give order to his
affairs, to the end he might as soon as it was night repair to the Ambassador
of Genouaes vessel, which he had caused to come from Pera to Constantinople,
and would attend for them at the Port. This said, he dismissed Doria, after he
had testified much affection unto him, and retained Ibrahim for one moment more
to take his last farewell of him; it was at this instant that Soliman showed
the greatest marks of his good will to the Grand Vizier, since it is most
certain, that silent sorrows, though they be not so eloquent as others, yet are
they at the least more persuasive. When Doria was gone the Sultan embraced
Ibrahim, but howsoever he forced himself, he could say no more, than go my dear
Ibrahim, restore Isabella to life again, but when you shall have revived her,
come and preserve mine. This discourse touched the Bassa so vively, as all the
answer he could make was, that his return should quickly justify his
departure; after which Soliman made a sign to him to be gone. He went away
then to his dear Doria, who stayed for him in another chamber; in their way
back they talked of nothing but great Soliman; Doria was so satisfied of him,
as he was constrained to confess, that he should want common sense if he were
not charmed by the rare qualities of so excellent a Prince. Ibrahim answered
hereunto with so much melancholy, as Doria was fain to speak of the Princess to
him for to draw him out of it; wherefore he dexterously told him, that Isabella
would be astonished at the present which she should receive from him. At this
sweet name Ibrahim began to take heart again, and somewhat dissipating his
heavyness, he turned all his thoughts to his departure. As soon as he was at
his Palace, he entered with Doria into his chamber, where having sent for the
Italian slave, he understood by him, that his habit was ready; whereupon he
called the principal Officers of his house once more before him, and told them
that he was going to depart away upon that occasion wherewith he had acquainted
them before, and therefore they should give order to the Porter of his Palace,
that he might not be troubled for the rest of the day, but to send such as came
about general affairs to the Bassa of the Sea, who during his absence was to
deal for him: After this he commanded them to withdravv, and remained alone
with Doria, and the slave that had brought him his habit. Now the night
beginning to approach, he held it time to think of parting, and this slave
being of counsel with them, was appointed by him to go and take that other of
Monaco, and conduct him to the Port, whether they would come to them. Ibrahim
having put on his habit, took some Jewels with him, in case he should stand in
any need upon the way by some unexpected encounter, and perceiving it to be
dark enough for them to go forth without discovery, he caused Doria to descend
by a back-stair, which brought them to a door that opened into the Garden, the
passage out of the which not being far distant from the Port, gave them the
commodity to get thither easily without being seen. And whereas Ibrahim knew
precisely whereabout the Christian vessels lay, and especially those of
Ambassadors, he went directly to the place, where he was attended for by the
order of the Tesqueregibassi, who when he gave the Ambassador his dispatch, had
ordained him to be as soon as it was night at the Key, there to receive the two
slaves of whom he had been spoken unto him at such time as he had audience from
his Highness: According hereunto, Ibrahim (whom we will hereafter call
Justiniano) after he had overtaken the slave of Monaco, found out the
Ambassador, who waiting for him, received him and Doria with transports of joy
that cannot be expressed; he could not comprehend how two men, who were believed
to be dead so long before, should be met withal at Constantinople: But if his
joy were excessive, that of our two friends was not less, for they knew him
exceeding well, as being of the Illustrious family of the Lomelines. Justiniano
thought then that he began already to breath the air of his country; but the
place being nothing commodious to complement in, they embarked themselves, and
a little after, when the Moon was up they weighed Anchor, and hoisting up their
sayls, they made toward the West, with so favorable a wind as the Art of the
Pilot was almost unprofitable in this encounter. This prosperous beginning of
Navigation made the Mariners to shout for joy, and gave them hope, that they
should see the coast of Genoua ere it were long. But amidst the common
gladness, Justiniano could not forget that he went from Constantinople without
quitting it utterly, and that by an invisible chain, which retained him there,
he was to return unto it a slave from Isabella; this troublesome thought for
all that lasted not long, and his imaginations flattered him so sweetly, in
making him see that he was every minute drawing near unto the Princess, as
losing the sight of Constantinople, he also lost the remembrance of all his
misfortunes, and abandoned himself wholly to joy.

IBRAHIM, OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The First Part. The Fourth Book.
NEver was voyage more prosperous, than that of Justiniano, nenever did the
winds more justly second the desires of the Pilot, and never was the Sea more
constant in calmness of weather, than it was in bringing this Lover back again
to the Haven, from whence the tempest had driven him. But to favor the
impatience he was in to be with Isabella, let us only say, without
particularizing his course, that after he was come to all the Vessels, which
the Grand Signior had caused to be arrested, and drawn out of captiviy all the
Christian Slaves which were found in the several Ports where they touched, by
virtue of an absolute power that he had from the Sultan; after, I say, that he
had passed the Archipelago, and left Ciprus on the left hand, this prosperous
Fleet arrived in a few days within sight of the Land of Genoua: There it was
where the Ambassador began to reap the fruit of his voyage, by the pleasure he
took in thinking that he was going to enter into his City, as it were in
triumph, by bringing thither again those so many Vessels which restored to the
People their kindred and friends, to the Nobility their children and their
riches, and to the Senate the Grace of the Grand Signior, and the lives of two
Illustrious Citizens. As for Doria, he felt that motion in his soul, which
Nature gives to all those who see their Country again after a long exile, and
that not troubled by the unruliness of passions following without resistance
the thoughts wherewith she inspires them; he had then an extreme pleasure, but
yet it was a quiet pleasure. But for Justiniano, it was not so with him, he did
not look upon this Land as the place of his birth, but as the residence of
Isabella, and in an instant he passed over again in his memory all that had
arrived unto him there; and his transport was so great, that joy produced some
effects of grief in him; he changed color diverse times, he was unquiet and
musing, and if Doria had not forced him to speak, and express his mind by his
discourse, it was to be doubted in beholding him, whether it were hope, or
whether it were fear, that agitated his soul; whether he regretted
Constantinople, or desired Genoua; so certain it is that violent passions
pervert the use of the senses. Tears, which ought not to be but the marks of
sorrow, serve sometimes for joy; and silence, which seems so proper for
sadness, is often the effect of an extreme pleasure; but as we come to one and
the same place by diverse ways, they were made contented by different causes,
and expressed their joy in several manners. In the mean time they came still
nearer to Genoua, but not holding it sit that Justiniano and Doria should enter
into the City before the deliberation of the Senate was known, the Ambassador
caused his Vessel to cast anchor three miles from Genoua, and going to pass
into another, after he had assured them that he would obtain their liberty, or
be exiled with them, he observed that Alphonso Spinola, Captain of one of those
redeemed Vessels, and brother to him whom Justiniano had slain in defending
Rhodolpho, hung back, and would not follow him, whereupon he would needs know
the cause of it; but Alphonso, whose generosity was extreme, seeing himself
obliged for his life, and for his liberty to Justiniano, who during the voyage
had testified unto him with much resentment the grief he had had for the
misfortune wherein he had been engaged; and knowing likewise that the death of
his brother had happened with some justice, he besought the Ambassador not to
think it strange if he did not attend upon him to Genoua, being absolutely
resolved never to enter into it without his Deliverer; that knowing his Father,
as he did, he was well assured that he would with all his power oppose them
that would revoke the Sentence which had been given against Justiniano; so that
to hinder his violence, he purposed to write unto him, that if he would have
his son again, he must pardon his enemy; that his fortune was conjoined with
his, and that he would never have such a reproach laid upon him, as that a man,
who had drawn him out of fetters, and brought him back into his Country,
should not enjoy the liberty which he had given him. Alphonso pronounced this
speech with so much earnestness, as all that heard him were ravished with his
resolution; and Justiniano was so charmed therewith, that not able to forbear
embracing him, and not suffering him to say more, he conjured him that he would
not force him to be ungrateful; that if nothing but his blood would satisfy
the revenge of his kindred, he would be most ready to shed it for his sake, but
having some hope to serve them more profitably in his person, when occasion
should present it self, he would spare no care nor good office for it, so as it
might be done without offense to his honor; that he had performed a gallant
action in desiring to stay with him, but that he should do an unworthy one, and
full of inhumanity if he should consent unto it; and that therefore it was more
just, that he should go and dry up his fathers tears, and moderate his fury by
the joy which his sight would bring him, than to do a thing that would procure
him his hatred. Alphonso did not yield at first to the desire of Justiniano,
but the Ambassador and Doria siding with him, he was constrained to submit to
their sense, and to let his inclination be overcome by another reason. These
illustrious friends parted with so much ado, as if Doria had not perceived by
Justinianoes watch, that the time of the Senates Assembly pressed the
Ambassador to depart, if he would have audience as soon as he should arrive,
they would have spent a great part of the day in this noble contestation,
whereof all the glory consisted in obliging his enemy. But whilst this Fleet
reasumed their course to aboard Genoua, let us go to the Port, and see what the
people think of it, and whether this agreeable surprise will make them send
forth shouts of joy in answer to those of the Mariners. As soon as these
Vessels began to appear, a confused noise was heard amongst those that were
present on the shore, whereby it appeared that they expected not so happy a
success of their Ambassadors voyage; the one said that the Senate was to be
advertised of it; others, that Merchants Vessels came not in so great a number
together; some, that Pirates durst not approach in that manner if they were not
followed by the body of an Army; and all of them together, that the best was to
give intelligence thereof, to the end some might be sent to discover them;
there were those likewise whose imagination was so troubled with fear, as they
verily believed that they distinctly saw Turkish Galleys, and half Moons. In
the mean time, whereas the Fleet came still nearer, they might easily discern,
that it was the Standard of the Republique which these Vessels carried, the
sight whereof dissipated their fear, but it took not from them their amazement,
being not able to imagine how they should be so near unto them, whom they
believed to be in chains and slavery; but at length the first of these Vessels
being come to the shore, and the Ambassador, who was seen on the poop, being
known of the people, which were already gathered together in a very great
number, and they no longer doubting but that these vessels, which now they
knew, brought them back both their brethren, and their children, such a noise
of acclamations arose on the sudden, as they all spoke without understanding
what they said themselves, and without being understood of others; wives called
for their husbands; fathers inquired after their children; some ran into the
City to advertise their friends of it; others ran out of it with their whole
families; they in the Vessels cried to let them know whether all were well at
home; at last so great a noise was formed of all these cries and murmures, as
the Ambassador had much ado to make his orders be understood: He commanded all
the Chieftaines to accompany him to the Palace, and particularly Alphonso not
to be far from him; they traversed the City in this sort, followed by the
popular multitude, who ceased not from testifying their joy, both by their
tears, and by their acclamation. When they were at the Gate of the Palace, the
Ambassador advanced three or four steps before his Troop, that he might the
better surprise that honorable Company. At his first appearing they sought to
know the success of his voyage in his face, but as soon as they perceived all
the Commanders of their Vessels, the gravest and most moderate amongst them
could not choose but show signs of their amazement, and joy; and when this
first emotion was appeased, the Ambassador, having made a low obeisance to the
Duke, and the like to the whole assembly, began to speak in this sort.

The Oration of Antonio Lomelino to the Duke and Senate of Genoua.
IF the prosperous success of my voyage had been an effect of my conduct, of my
care, and of my address, I should without doubt have had so much modesty as to
declare in few words the estate of things, for to attend from so honorable an
Assembly the praise which a service of such importance would have deserved,
without giving them to my self; and I should also have been so generous, as to
have been fully satisfied with the only thought of having been profitable to
my Country; but whereas I have no part in the glory of this action, but
contrarily I my self am obliged for my life to the Deliverer of so many
illustrious Slaves as I have brought you back, and which are all, either your
kinsmen, or your friends, it behooves me, both that I may not be ungrateful in
my particular, and that also I may keep you from being so in general, to
report fathfully unto you how the matter has past, to the end that by
understanding all the circumstances you may the better know, how it is the
interest of the Republique, which makes me speak with so much earnestness.

You are to understand then, my Lords, that whereas the Emperor Soliman
believed, that the Law of Nations had been violated in the person of his
Chaoux, he thought that he might do the like in that of your Ambassador, so
that as soon as I was arrived at Pera, and that according to the custom I had
demanded audience of his Highness, I saw my self constrained to pass by his
order from my Vessel into a straight prison, without telling me the cause
thereof, in such sort as he that came to obtain the liberty of others, saw
himself deprived of his own, and laden with chains. I was two days entreated
in this manner with a great deal of rigor, and I very well perceived by the
countenance of them which guarded me, that they believed my head was the only
price of my liberty. As I was in this unquietness I saw the Aga of the
Janissaries enter, who caused me to be told by Dragoman of the grand Signioes,
whom we call an interpreter, that his Highness willing to give me audience had
commanded him to conduct me to Constantinople without any ceremony; this
mutation surprised me so much the more, for that I could not imagine the cause
of it, having been well enough informed, that Soliman does not easily change
his resolutions, and that repenting is a motion of the soul which is almost
unknown to him: In the mean time I beheld my fetters broken off, without seeing
the hand that delivered me, and in this uncertainty I attributed that to the
inconstancy of Fortune, which I owed her not at all. But, my Lords, why should
I longer conceal this mighty and generous hand which has delivered me? The
impatience which I see in your looks, to know the name of our Deliverer,
invites that also which is in me to tell it you; wherefore I must interrupt my
order, and without going to Constantinople to paint forth unto you the
resentment, the choler and the menaces of the Sultan, I say unto you, that he
unto whom you ow the return of your vessels, the lives of your children, and
the peace of this Republic, was not carried to this brave action by a sense of
acknowledment; it is a man who could have revenged himself, instead of serving
you, without committing an injustice; it is a man whom you have exiled because
he withstood a violence; it is a man whom you have chased away because he had
been so generous as to save his enemies life; it is a man whom you have
banished because he shed his blood to take part with the weaker, and who by
misfortune killed one of your Citizens, not only to secure his own person, but
to assist an undefended man; finally, my Lords, it is by Justiniano that we
are living; it is by him that we breath the air of our Country; it is by him
that we do not see an Army of an hundred thousand men at your Gates; and it is
also by his liberty, and that of Doria, who is conjoined to his fortune, that
you may pay our ransom, as the only price which great Soliman has set to
redeem us: It is in preserving this illustrious person that you may preserve
the glory of the Senate; and it is upon this condition, that according to the
power which I had for it, I have engaged the Public Faith for the revocation
of a Sentence which you signed with regret, and which you accorded rather to
the tears of Philippo Spinola, whom I see here in this renowned Company, than
to Sovereign equity: It is not because I will condemn in him the apprehensions
of Nature, but contrarily I purpose to stir them up in his heart, by letting
him see that if by misfortune Justiniano has deprived him of one son, the
same Justiniano has restored him another, in bringing him back Alphons^, who
with tears in his eyes begs of him by my mouth the grace of his Deliverer. They
which are sensible of outrages ought to be so likewise of benefits, especially
when injuries have not been done by a premeditated malice, and the services are
voluntary: one may tell me peradventure, that the satisfaction should at
leastwise be equal to the crime, for the defacing of it out of an incensed
spirit, and that Justiniano having taken away the life of a child of
Philippoes, it is not enough for obtaining the pardon thereof, that he has
restored his only son to his liberty; but grant it were true, that Justiniano
had done no other thing than break the chains of Alphonso, this objection could
not be received but by base and weak souls; it being most certain, that a
generous man will always prefer the conservation of his liberty before that of
his life: It is a good so generally known of all the world, as there is no
Nation that has not made war to conserve it. The most honorable Servitude
has ever found some rebellion in the minds of those who have embraced it; and
if the Religion which we profess, did not prohibit us, from disposing of our
selves, there is not a Slave amongst the Turks that would not make himself away
with joy, to get out of the miseries which he indures; for if one has seen at
other times both men and women to have recourse to this extreme remedy, because
they were for one day only to follow the Chariot of the Victorious, bound with
chains of gold, what ought not men do, who laden with irons are sent to the
prisons of the black Sea, where it may be said that they enter alive into their
graves, being put into deep holes where horror and darkness, which always reign
there, are the least of their pains? They feel the rigor of hunger, they are
beaten and tormented in their bodies, yea and persecuted in their minds by the
injuries and blasphemies which they daily hear from the mouths of their
torturers: It is, my Lords, from this dreadful place that Justiniano has
drawn out Alphonso to bring him back into his Country, for to speak the truth,
he could not avoid the feeling of the miseries which I have represented unto
you, or of dying cruelly; his Sentence was pronounced, as well as of that of
his companions, and if we had tarried but one day longer before we arrived at
the place, where h^ was retained, Solimans Order had come too late to work that
which he had formerly given, and the succor of justiniano had been in vain;
Now I leave it to be judged, whether the reparation be equal to the crime, and
whether Philippo has reason to oppose the return of Justiniano. But not to
conceal one important thing that may lead him to a good sense, I must say
further, that Alphonso, who cannot be worthily enough praised, and whose
presence keeps me from speaking more of it, knowing how far he is obliged to
Justiniano, is absolutely resolved to follow the fortune of his Deliverer; it
is by his order that I speak, and his silence does sufficiently prove this
verity unto you; it is not but to confirm what I say that he is come hither,
and to obey Justiniano, who would not let him stay with him as he desired. At
last, my Lords, if Philippo will preserve his son he must join his prayers to
those of all the people, who conjure you to accord the grace of him who has
filled your City with abundance, and all the families of Genoua with joy; all
the acclamations of gladness, which you hear at the Palace gate, speak to you
for pardon and mercy; but if you oppose the severity of the Laws to prayers so
just, so pressing, and necessary for the public tranquillity, I have to answer
you, that it is not to offend them, but to satisfy justice, which ought to be
the rule of them; and that the same Laws, which will have a crime punished,
will also have virtue recompensed. If there be need of examples of Sentences
that have been revoked, all antiquity will furnish us therewith: Aristides was
banished by the Ostracisme, and repealed within three years after; Cimon was
exiled from Athens, and entreated to return, even by those that had driven him
away; at Sparta one Leontidas was used in the same manner; amongst the
Lacedaemonians. Philoxenus had the same fortune; and if we will go to Rome, we
shall find, that Seneca was banished by Claudius, and called home again by him
for some praises which he had given him in a letter of consolation, that he
wrote to Polibius his favorite; judge now my Lords, whether flattery spoken
with a good grace may enter into comparison with the service that Jnstiniano
has rendered you. But to pass from antiquity to the modern age, have we not
seen amongst the Venetians Hortensio Contarini condemned to a perpetual
banishment, who returned into his Country a little after with the same honors
which he formely had there? And without going to seek for authorities amongst
our neighbors, which we may find amongst our selves, has not one seen Antonia
Fregoza exiled for ever from his Country, who nevertheless was by a decree from
the Senate restored to his former liberty in Genoua? I could also find many
other particulars in History to confirm my proposition, but I think it may
suffice, that Greece and Italy have marked you out the way, which you may
follow without fear of failing, after so many Illustrious examples. Howbeit you
will peradventure say, that albeit you could infringe your Laws in favor of
Justiniano, because he has done you such great services, yet Doria cannot
pretend to the same grace, seeing he himself owes his liberty to our
Deliverer; but I am to answer you for the glory of this disinteressed friend,
who hazarded his life, by a generosity without example, to revenge the outrage
which the Prince of Masseran did to Justiniano, that this action seemed so
gallant to Soliman, when as Justiniano recounted it unto him, that he has
judged Doria worthy of his protection: Besides do you not imagine that the
interests of these two illustrious persons can ever be separated. And to tell
you all that I think in this encounter, prepare your selves to execute what I
have promised, or resolve to lose at the same instant all the commanders of
your Vessels, who have every one, as well as my self, solemnly sworn never to
enjoy the liberty which Justiniano has gotten us, unless he be partaker of it
with us. As for me, who do certainly know of what importance this affair
is for the public good, I should think that I should betray my Country, if I
should conceal the eagernes which I observed in the mind of Soliman, when as
he told me that one of his slaves having found grace in his sight, had besought
him to pardon us; and that he had consented thereunto, provided that you should
revoke the Sentences, which you had given against Justiniano and Doria; wherein
if you failed, he swore in fury, that he would come with all the forces of his
Empire to destroy our Republique. It is no longer then, my Lords, a particular
interest; it is no longer the merit of Justiniano, that is to be considered in
this occasion; it is not for the hope of brave things that he will do
hereafter, that this grace is to be accorded him; it is not for our ransom that
he is to be received with joy; it is not because I have promised it that it is
to be resolved on; it is not because reason does counsel it; it is not because
justice does ordain it; but it is because necessity will have it so. You will
say to me, it may be, that the success of this War would still be doubtful,
but, my Lords, if you consider the inequality of your forces you will not doubt
at all, especially in a time wherein all the Princes of Christendom are not in
a condition to assist their Allies. Shall it be from the Emperor that you will
be protected in this occasion, who finds himself too much entangled in the War
with the Protestants, and in the affairs of the Council of Trent, for to
think of yours? Shall it be from the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily that you
look for succor, they that are exhausted both of men and money for the Emperor
their Master? Shall it be from the Switzers, or the Grisons, that we shall be
assisted in this encounter, they that are engaged in all these Wars, and that
are more likely rather to side with the stronger party, than to succor the
weaker? It may be that the French will furnish us with that which we cannot
find elsewhere, but, my Lords, were they not in War with the Emperor, yet would
they see us perish with joy, and the Armies of the Turks could not do that
amongst us, which they would not do here with theirs, if they were in an estate
to be revenged on us for our changing. You will tell me further, that the
Republiques of Florence, Siena and Lucca are not so far of, but that one may be
succored from them, but they are so engaged in those two parties, as they have
not the liberty to dispose of their forces. The Duke of Savoy might also do
something for you if he were peaceable in his State, but he himself is so
busied in preparing to hinder the passage of the French, as he cannot mind the
extremities of his neighbors. I know very well in like manner, that England is
full of armed men, but, my Lords, it is not to defend us, nor will Queen Mary
abandon the siege of London, which is to put her in possession of her Kingdom,
to come and oppose our enemies. Neither will Scotland disfurnish her self of
her men or War, having such mighty Armies at her frontires, wherefore we are
not to turn our eyes that way. Poland, Hungary, and Moscovy, are too near unto
the Turk for to imbroil themselves with him. And Sweathland and Denmark are too
far off for any succor to be hoped from thence. At last, my Lords, to leave
nothing unsaid, the death of Julius the third, and of his successor, falling
out in so little a time, permit not his Holiness, who is not yet well
established, to think of affairs abroad. And to take all hope from you, the
Venetians, desiring to conserve that which they hold in the Archipelaglo, will
not break the Treaty they have made with the Turk to succor you. You see then,
my Lords, that all Christendom does abandon you, and that there is nothing
resting in you choice, but the burning of your City, and the utter destruction
of this State, or the return of Justiniano and Doria. But to justify the ardor
of my Zeal, and to make it appear, that my fear is not without ground, I do here
deliver into your hands the Grand Signiors letter, which it may be will carry
you more easily to my sense, and reason.

This oration was heard by the Senate with a great deal of attention, amazement
and joy; and when the Duke had taken the Grand Signiors letter, he commanded an
interpreter to come and expound it; in the mean time a confused voice arose in
this Assembly, which made Philippo Spinola conjecture, that the grace of
Justiniano would soon be granted: Never was there heart agitated with so much
violence, and whereas this man was sensible and generous, the designs of
pardoning or punishing so equally divided his soul, as not knowing which side
to turn him to, he seemed to seek for in the eyes of Alphonso vvherevvith to
fortify his reason. He wept all at one instant both for grief and tenderness,
the remembrance of the dead, and the return of the living, excited in his mind,
both a calm and a tempest; and in this disorder of passions, and apprehensions
of nature, which combatted one with another, and successively destroyed
themselves, he was going to be the prey of despair and sorrow, had not the
sight of his Son been at length found more powerful, than the image of his
past misfortune: He knew so distinctly the sense of Alphonso by the motions of
his face, as being ashamed to be less generous than he, he let his resentment
be surmounted by so noble an example, which presently appeased all the troubles
of his spirit; so that feeling himself in a more peaceable estate, and seeing
the Duke about to speak, he to prevent him besought him with tears in his eyes
to restore that unto Justiniano, which his prosecutions had taken from him; it
being just, since he had rendered him a son, that he should render him his
liberty. This discourse so ravished the whole Assembly, that contrary to their
custom, and the respect of the place, they sent forth cries of joy, which did
not cease very soon; but amongst the rest the young Count of Lavagna, together
with Alphonso, who were present, thought they should never have been silent
again; the first could not sufficiently commend this action, and the other
could not forbear saying, that he was more obliged to his father for
vanquishing himself, than for giving him life. But after every one had praised
Philippo as much as he deserved, they betook them to their places and gravitie
again, for to hearken to the Letter, which the Interpreter expounded in this
sort by the commaandment of the Duke.

I that am by the grace of the most High, and by the abundance of Miracles of
the Chief of his Prophets, Emperor of the Victorious Emperors, King of Kings,
Lord of Lords, Distributer of Crowns and Scepters to the greatest Princes and
Monarchs of the Earth: The servant of the two most Holy and Sacred Towns of
Mecca and Medina: Lord of Europe, Asia, and Africa, Conquered with our
Victorious sword and dreadful Lance; to the Duke and Senate of the Republique
of Genoua.

If one of our Slaves had not found grace in our sight, we should soon have
made you feel the force of our terrible sword, and our clemency had not
returned you, as it has done, your Vessels, your goods, your people, and your
Ambassador; but is upon condition that you cause the sentences to be revoked,
which were given against Justiniano, and against Doria, and that they may fully
enjoy their liberty, and their goods, as heretofore: For otherwise be you
assured, that with all the power of our flourishing Empire, our Highness will
come, and abase your pride, make himself be obeyed in Person, and destroy your
Republique.

Given at our Imperial City of Stambol, in the year of Egira nine hundred and
sixty, the twelvth day of the month Ramadham. Soliman.


This Letter inspired all them that heard it with fear, justified the
Ambassadors zeal, and confirmed all the Assembly in the resolution to receive
Justiniano, as the Deliverer of the Republique; so that when the Duke had
propounded the matter, and that according to the custom he should have gone to
collect the voices in particular, they said all, that in affairs where opinions
might be divided, it was good to hold that course, but now, that the whole
company had but one and the same voice, they were not to amuse themselves about
this superfluous ceremony; it being fitter to go with all speed, and assure
Justiniano and Doria, that they were still Citizens of Genoua, for fear lest
they should by this retardment imagine, that they had been hardly drawn to sign
their grace. They advised then what order they were to hold, and they judged,
that to take away all suspicion from Justiniano, they were to send him a
public Act, signed by the Duke and all the Senate, whereby he should be
assured of the revocation of his sentence: but the Ambassador having told them,
that Justiniano would rely on his word, they changed their purpose, and
commanded Jannetin Doria to take a Galley in the Port, for to go and receive
him as far from the City as possibly he could: They ordained also that the
Ambassador should put himself into a Feluca, to the end he might go before, and
advertise Justiniano that he was attended with impatience, and should be
received with joy. And whereas it was resolved that some should accompany
Jannetin who represented Andrea Doria his Uncle, that was Generalissimo, and
absent from Genoua at that time, the Count of Lavagna would be one of them,
that he might renew his acquaintance, for he was not much more then a child
when Justiniano went away. The Commanders of those vessels whom he had
redeemed, would not go home to their houses before they had conducted their
Deliverer into their City, to the end that as in the ancient Triumphs, the
Victorious were followed by the Princes whom they had vanquished, so Justiniano
should be accompanied with the Citizens which he had delivered, but with this
glorious difference, that the one touched them with compassion which looked on
them, and that the others inspired all them that beheld them with joy; the
former were freemen that were made slaves, and these were slaves to whom
liberty was given: And if heretofore at Rome he was crowned with glory that
saved the life of a Roman Citizen, what crown, and what glory was not
Justiniano worthy of, who by his generosity hindered not onley the death of so
great a number of men, but the utter destruction of his country? And indeed ^e
was received with so many acclamations, as never was so universal a joy seen
in Genoua before. This while the Ambassador being set forth in a Feluca with
Alphonso and some others, and having a good way out-gone Jnnetins Galley, made
with all speed to Justiniano, who since they parted from him had scarcely
spoken to Doria, so much was he taken up with the thought of Isabella. As soon
as they were ne^r enough to be understood, they began to talk to him of triumph
and glory, not having the patience to stay till they were aboard the vessel to
let him know the happy success of their voyage. Doria answered this interrupted
discourse with cries of joy; but Justiniano made it appear by the moderation of
his, that his liberty was not the term of his desires; he received his friends
for all that with a great deal of civility, and without attending their further
relation, he would have rendered them thanks for their care and affection, but
they had too much to say to permit him to speak. The Ambassador would have
discharged the Senates Commission; Alphonso would have acquanted him with the
generosity of his father; another would have described unto him the ecstasy of
the people; and ma^ger the coldness of the Nation, the impatience they were in
to speak all together, made a confusion amongst them, which yet kept not
Justiniano from clearly perceiving, that his generosity was acknowledged, and
his grace signed. But whereas the Galley still approached, Justiniano said,
that it was not just they should stay from going to meet those Illustrious
friends, who came to restore him to life, in restoring him to his liberty: He
commanded them to weigh Anchor, which being presently executed, they made
toward the Galley, that, carried along with sayls and oars, reached them in a
little space. There it was where Justiniano felt an extraordinary emotion upon
the sight of the young Count of Lavagna, whom the Ambassador showed unto him;
he whose father had always been the protector of his house: This sight gave
him a great deal of joy, but mingled with grief, by the remembrance of
Simbaldoes death: Now as soon as his vessel came close to the Galley, he
instantly, without attending Jannetins order, leaped from the hatches into her,
and after he had complemented with the Delegates of the Senate, he embraced the
Count with so much testimony of affection, as it was easy to know, that
absence destroys not a friendship, which is solidly established in a generous
soul; for at the very time when he rejoiced to see him, he lamented his fathers
death. The Count on his part assured him that he would have the same respect
for him as Sinibaldo had had; and conjured him to show him the same favor. On
the other side Doria, though he were not well satisfied with Andrea Prince of
Melphi, nor with Jannetin his Nephew, yet carried he himself courteously unto
him, and then went and received the civilities of his friends. During all these
caresses, Jannetin desiring to give some mark of esteem and joy to Justiniano,
caused a largess to be distributed amongst the slaves, to the end they might
row with the more speed. Justiniano received this gallantry very civilly, and
withal assured the slaves, that when he came home he would remember that they
had brought him to the Port, as accordingly he sent them the next day two
thousand Crowns. As soon as they approached to Genoua, all the vessels that
were in the Port, having received a commandment to shoot off all their Cannon
when Justiniano should appear, failed not to salute him; the Galley answered
them with four pieces of Ordnance, and a volley of Musket Shot, and the like
did all that were on the walls. If one would describe the number of Citizens
that were at the Port, the acclamations of joy, the thronging that was there to
see these resuscitated men, the tumult that was amongst them in striving who
should come nearest to their Deliverer, it would almost take up a volume that
should treat of nothing else; it were better then, that amidst this popular
crowd we should conduct Justiniano to the Senate, followed by the Count of
Lavagna, Jannetin, Doria, Alphonso, and all the Commanders of the vessels, as
also the slave of Monaco, whom Justiniano had enjoined not to budge from him.
When first they appeared, the Duke out of more than an extraordinary favor
advanced to receive him, after which he appointed all the Senators to take
their places, and then commanded the Register of the Senate to deface the
Sentences which had been pronounced against Justiniano and Doria, and to read
the abolition of them, which was conceived in such gentle and advantageous
terms, as it plainly appeared, that even their crime deserved more glory than
punishment: The reading whereof being ended, the Duke began to assure
Justiniano in the name of the whole Assembly, that after they had satisfied the
pleasure of Soliman, yet held they not themselves for all that acquitted
toward him; that the Senate in general, and they all in particular, were
resolved not to stay there, but to testify unto him with more utility, that
they were not worthy of the benefits they had received from him; that they
desired him also to raze out of his memory, as he was razed out of their
Records, the remembrance of the sentences which had been given against him and
his friend. To this Justiniano answered, that in banishing him they ^ad
satisfied Justice, and that in repealing him they had rather showed their
clemency than their equity; that the service which he had rendered to the
Republique, was not considerable, seeing he had done it but to satisfy his
duty; and that also, in acknowledgement of the grace it had done him, he swore
solemnly always to hazard both his fortune and life for the interest and glory
thereof, so often as occasion should present it self for it: This said, he
turned him to Philippo Spinola, and entreated him to pardon Alphonso for his
friendship toward him, and to believe that it could never have found place in
his heart, had he not perfectly known during his voyage, that the death of his
brother had made him shed more tears, than he had lost blood; that if his
generosity would permit him utterly to deface out of his mind the resentment of
that unlucky accident; he besought him to adopt him for his son, and to
attend from him the same services, and the same obedience, as he could have
desired from him of whom he was so unfortunately deprived; but if that
contrarily the apprehensions of Nature did still invite him to revenge, he
promised to banish himself voluntarily; and if that were not yet enough, he
would submit to the greatest rigor of Justice. Philippo was so moved with this
discourse, as if he had not already signed the grace of Justiniano in
consideration of his son, he could not have forborne doing it, and embracing
him; so true it is that virtue has powerful charms for a generous soul. That
venerable old man answered him with tears in his eyes, that he would never
oppose Alphonsoes friendship to him; that it was too just to be condemned; that
owing him his life, and his liberty, he owed him all things; and that not being
so unreasonable as to remember an injury, and not remember benefits, he assured
him that these last should take from his mind all the bitterness of the other;
that he would receive him for his son; that he would have all the tenderness
of a Father for him; and that all the satisfaction he desired of him was, that
he would forget his prosecutions, and his hatred, and pardon them to an
afflicted Father. There past besides so many obliging speeches between them, as
all that were present had much ado to retain their tears; but at the last the
Duke arising, all the Assembly did the like: Then it was that they embraced
Justiniano, every one striving who should come soonest unto him to testify his
joy; after which the Count of Lavagna carried him home to his house, there to
abide till his own was made ready to receive him, for he had been Administrator
of it ever since the death of Sinibaldo, unto whom the Father of Justiniano had
left his estate to conserve it for his son; and though all the world
believed, that Justiniano was no longer alive, yet had not the Count changed
the order of his affairs, being absolutely resolved not to confer his estate
upon his heirs, before he was certainly assured that he was dead. As for
Doria, the Count could not get him to go along with him, though he would have
been glad to have past the rest of the day in the company of his friend, but
his kinsmen carried him much against his will away with them, having first
conducted Justiniano as well as all the rest, to the Counts Palace, where every
one departing, except some few whom he retained at dinner with Justiniano, he
led him to the chamber of Leonora his wife, who received him with a great deal
of courtesy, and so did Sophronia, Leonoraes sister, which was there with her.
But as soon as civility permitted him to retire, he turned all his thoughts to
Monaco; and whereas he saw that the necessity of good manners would hold him
three or four days at Genoua to receive and to return the visits of his
friends, he resolved to send thither the same day, the rather for that he
judged it fit to understand the Princesses pleasure before he went to her; he
proposed his design then unto the Count, and desired him to let him have one of
his servants for to execute it, and to put into his hands the Princesses
Officer, whom he had found a slave at Constantinople. The Count could not
refuse him so just a request, but only told him that he was to dine first:
Whilst they were at table their conversation was no other than asking
Justiniano questions concerning his fortune, whereunto he still ansvvered
with so much address, as without saying any thing against the truth, he
discovered n^ught that might prejudice him; howbeit he recounted unto them his
grief (...) despair, whenas he believed in Germany that Isabella had married
the Prince o^ Masseran, as also that having taken a resolution to die, he went
and imbarqued himself upon the Baltique Sea; that there he was made a slave,
was carried to Constantinople, and given to the Grand Signior, where Doria
arrived afterward by an adventure almost like to his; that his good fortune
had so wrought, as his Highness having found something in his person, which
touched his inclination, his slavery had not been very hard, if his Friends,
his Mistress, and his Religion had not been obstacles to his felicity; but he
would not let them know that he had been Grand Vizier, nor how in that Charge
he had mightily served Christendom, for fear lest this action should have been
ill interpreted by them, that could not dive into the bottom of his heart.
Dinner being done, Justiniano desired the Count to permit him to go and write
in his Cabinet before he was hindered by company, which no doubt would be with
him ere it were long. The Count, who was not willing that his own pleasure
should destroy that of his friend, opened him the door, and told him, that he
was infinitely obliged to the Princess of Monaco, who, ever after she had power
to dispose of her self, had been fought unto by all the Princes of Italy,
without so much as once harkning unto them; but that contrarily she had openly
published, how she had resolved to renounce the world, as soon as she certainly
knew that he was no longer in it; that she had often had business at Genoua,
where her presence was necessary, but would never come thither, so much did she
fear the fight of them that might condemn her resolution. Justiniano was so
ravished with the constancy of Isabella, that if the Count had not left him for
to return unto the company, this talk had kept him a long time from drawing up
his Letter; but in the end after he had written all that which his respect, his
joy, and his passion had inspired him with, he gave his packet to a Gentleman,
whom the Count had assigned him for it; he prayed him to go, and come again
from Monaco, with all the speed that possibly he could; and to add moreover to
that favor the observing the actions of Isabella, at such time as she should
understand of his return, and that she should see him, whom he had sent her
back; that Officer of hers too he caressed exceedingly, and assured him that he
would acknowledge the pains which he had suffered for his consideration.
Justiniano had no sooner ended his dispatch, but that all the illustrious
persons of the City came to visit him, with an extreme impatience to learn from
his own mouth the success of his adventures. But whilst he is satisfying the
curiosity of so fair an Assembly, and telling them things which we know as
vell as he, let us go and content ours at Monaco, and see with what eye, and in
what manner the Princess will receive the agreeable news of her Lovers return.
When these happy Messengers arrived the next day at Monaco it was very near
night, so that although one of them belonged to the Princess, yet was he not
known, nor would he discover himself, the better to surprise her: It was
only told then to Isabella, that a Gentleman from the Count of Lavaegna, and
another, who were newly arrived in a Barque, desired to speak with her, and
that they had order to deliver their message to none but her self. She was at
that time in her Cabinet, where she had shut up her self that day to read over
all the Letters which she had received from Justiniano; she was vexed then to
be interrupted in an employment, that made up together both her joy and her
grief; she commanded notvvithstanding that they should be brought in: But when
she came to know him, whom she had sent to seek Iustiniano, she was so
surprised, and so amazed, out of the opinion she had that his voyage was in
vain, as the apprehension thereof keeping her from speaking, gave the Counts
Gentleman opportunity to tell her, that Iustiniano had given him in charge to
present her with a Letter from him. This discourse revived her spirits for a
while, but fearing she had not understood him well, she made that agreeable
name which touched her heart so sensibly, to be spoken to her once again;
vvhereupon the Gentleman told her, that the paper he had presented to her
would satisfy her better than he could. She cast her eyes then upon the
Letter, which assured her that it was Iustinianoes hand, so that in an
instant she abandoned her self over wholy to joy, and with an extreme
precipitation broke up the seal of the Letter for to read that which follows
here.

The Letter of Iustiniano to the Princess of MONACO.
AT Last fortune has made a truce with me, and how constant soever she has
been in persecuting me, my love has vanquished her cruelty, and forced her to
permit me to see you again. I know well, that the suspicion which I have had of
your fidelity, makes me unworthy of this grace; but I know well also, that my
cruellest enemies have pardoned me for it, and that you have a soul too
generous not to do as much for a person that voluntarily accuses himself of a
crime, which in my opinion is the greatest mark of love that ever I have
rendered you. If the possession of you had not been so precious unto me, my
resentment had not been so great; and if my passion had been less perfect, hate
had succeeded to my love: But to what transport soever that imaginary
misfortune has carried my mind, yet have you always reigned in my heart. I
have hated your inconstancy, but I have always loved your person; I have
separated the crime from the criminal; I would never have extinguished so fair
a flame, but in extinguishing my life, and with the most passionate sense that
love can inspire into us, I have even adored you in the arms of a Rival, and
conserved my soul entirely for you at that very time when as I believed I had
lost you for ever. After all this I dare hope, that my crime shall not be an
obstacle strong enough to keep you from according me the permission to come and
render you an account of my misadventures, to comfort me with your sight for my
past miseries; to let me understand from your own mouth, that absence has not
diminished your affection; that mine is still considerable with you; and that
at last you desire I should eternally be your

Justiniano.


Never was there heart more replenished with joy, than that of Isabella, after
she had read this Letter; nor ever had an amorous spirit sweeter transports,
than this Princess felt in thus understanding all at once the life, the return,
and the fidelity of her Lover: But her satisfaction augmented yet more, when as
she knew in what manner he had been received at Genoua, no way doubting now but
that her felicity was settled for the rest of her life. After she had spent two
hours at least in hearing these persons relate unto her what they had known
concerning Justiniano, she gave order that they should be very well treated,
and that the next morning the Counts Gentleman should repair unto her. As soon
as she saw her self alone, she called a kinswoman of hers, which lived with
her, and not able to contain her joy, she imparted the cause of it to her, but
in such passionate terms, as it was easy to perceive, that she lived not so
much in her self as in Justiniano: And that she might no longer deferr her
answer unto him, she caused paper and ink to be brought her: but though she had
a fertile wit, though she were accustomed to express her self very easily, and
not to have any need to correct her first by her second thoughts, yet was it
almost impossible for her to satisfy her self in this occasion: She could not
conceive that the words of pleasure, of felicity, and joy, could sufficient^y
express he^s; that those of constancy and stedfastness were significant enough;
nor that those of passion, and love, were powerful enough to paint forth to
Justiniano that which she had in her soul: Howbeit in the end, after she had
blotted out lines, and torn whole Letters, she was constrained to be contented;
and whereas it was late, she got her to bed without eating any thing,
notwithstanding her woman's persuasion to the contrary. She passed the night in
such agreeable thoughts, as albeit sleep be a sweet and a mighty enemy, yet
could it not for all that surprise the fair eyes of Isabella, so that as soon
as the day appeared, her impatience caused her to command the fetching of the
Counts Gentleman unto her, hoping that the sooner he returned, the sooner she
should see Justiniano; and to oblige him to make have, she sent him a Diamond
worth five hundred Crowns. This liberality failed not to make him diligent; he
came presently to the Princesses Chamber, both to render her thanks, and to
receive her commands: she gave him her Letter, and desired him to present her
complements to the Count his Master, and to assure Justiniano that he was
attended with a great deal of impatience. This Gentleman, according to
Isabellaes desire, made all the have that possibly he could to Genoua, where
being arrived he found Iustiniano ready to enter into his own house,
accompanied with ten or eleven of his friends, for the Count had been so
careful that no mark of his banishment should be remaining, as in two days it
was thoroughly furnished. As soon as he saw this Gentleman, he separated
himself from the troup for to speak with him, and receive Isabellaes answer,
which he took with such a panting of his heart, as if he had doubted that it
had not been favorable. In the mean time the Count perceiving Iustinianoes
disorder, caused all the company to enter, by entering first himself, so that by
this address he gave him means to steal aside to read in liberty the Princesses
letter, which he opened with a great deal of respect, and found that it was
thus.

The Letter of Isabella to Iustiniano.
THe greatest crime that you are guilty of toward me is, that you came not to
tell me that you self, which you have written unto me; I know well
notwithstanding that the necessity of your ancient misfortunes has constrained
you to carry your self in this sort; but I am not ignorant also, that love is
not accustomed to make such satisfaction to sovereign reason; the desires,
which it begets in an amorous soul, seem always just unto it, and how
reasonable soever we be, it is a pain to us to condemn that which pleases us;
find it not strange then, if I should wish, that you had seen my first
transports, they would have painted out so well unto you my fidelity, as I
should no longer be troubled to assure you, that time has not changed my
heart; that death alone can break my chains; and that if I had the Empire of
the whole world, I would pray you to accept of it with as much affection, as I
offer you my State: it is a reward which I ow you, and not a grace which I do
you; and the only grief which I have at this instant is, to see that I can do
nothing, whereunto I am not obliged; so that all that I can do in this
encounter is, to protest unto you, that did I not ow it to the life of my
father, which you preserved; to the promise which he made you of it; to that
which you received from me; to so many miseries which you have endured for my
consideration; yet do I ow it to mine own felicity, seeing it is certain, that
I cannot be perfectly happy if I be not so with you: it is a necessity that
love has imposed upon me, and which reason does not disapprove of. Come then,
my dear Justiniano, to testify unto me, that my hopes are not ill grounded,
that your constancy is immovable, that you still love your

Isabella.


They who know by experience the effects of love, will easily imagine that
which the sight of this Letter wrought in the soul of Justin^^no; he had for
all that a domestique enemy, which went always traversing his pleasures, by
putting him in mind that he was yet a slave at Constantinople, though he
appeared a freeman at Genoua. In the mean time the Count sent him word how he
believed he had forgotten, that he was in his own house, and that it was he
which was to entertain and honor his friends there. This reproach of gallantry
obliged him to go in unto them, who all left him a little after, except Doria,
to give him liberty for to think of his affairs; but whilst he was settling his
house, the Count sent him all the money which he had received of his estate in
his absence, with order to his Steward to render him an account of it.
Justiniano was so amazed, both at his own riches, and the generosity of his
friend, as he had much ado to resolve to take that which was his own; howbeit
fearing to do an outrage to the Count, instead of doing him a civility, he
received his money, but would not suffer the Steward howsoever to particularise
any thing of his affairs; telling him only, that provided he could assure him
he gave him nothing of another bodies, it should suffice for the making up of
his account; that in the mean time to make some acknowledgment for the care he
had taken to enrich him, he gave him twelve thousand Crowns. This man fearing a
check from his Master, played the generoso as much as he could, and labored
exceedingly not to accept of a thing which he earnestly desired: but at length
he must obey the pleasure of Justiniano, who thinking of nothing but Monaco
gave order for the making him clothes against the next day; and not to lose
time, after he had desired the Counts Officer to provide him attendants, to
make up his Train with all possible care and speed, he went forth with his dear
Doria to render the most important of his visits, to the end he might the day
following satisfy his desires. They imp^oyed all that day then in ceremonies;
they were at the Palace to do their duty to the Duke; they were at Andrea
Doria's to visit Jannetin; they returned to the Count; and to be wanting in
nothing Iustiniano would go home to Philippo Spinola, where he was received
with so many testimonies of generosity, both by the father and the son, as
all his civility could not answer it. Evening being come, he returned back with
Doria, where he found a man attending him from the Generalissimo, who being
come home had understood of his going to Monaco, and therefore had sent to
assure him, that the next morning he should have a Galley waiting ready to
carry him thither. Justiniano accepted of this courtesy with a great deal of
respect, and prayed the man to let his Master know, that he would not part away
without thanking him for it: And whereas his amorous impatience made him desire
to be alone, that he might at the least think of the Princess, though he could
not yet see her, he was much surprised, and exceedingly vexed, to find as
great a company in his chamber, as that which he had met with abroad; for
although it was composed of none but his friends, yet would he fain have
preferred solitude before their conversation; howbeit he must resolve to comply
with them, and hear a Serenado of Lutes and Voices which the Count gave him,
upon remembering that he had heard say, how the first passion of Justiniano had
been by music: The Count also presented unto him a French Gentleman, whom he
dearly loved, and desired him to esteem of him for his sake, until such time
as he should make himself worthy of it by the knowledge of his merit, which
without doubt would not be long first. This complement being finished, every
one retired save Doria, who would not abandon our Lover, until he had restored
him into the arms of his Mistress. The night past away with a great deal of
unquietness and impatience for Justiniano; but whatsoever resolution he had
taken to be gone by the break of day, he could not get out of Genoua before it
was almost noon. In the end he imbarqued himself in the Galley which had been
prepared for him, taking no more with him than his dear Doria, and some of the
Counts people for to serve him: He had at that instant so extraordinary a joy
out of the thought that the term of so short a navigation should be the sight
of Isabella, as it reflected in his face, was seen in his eyes, appeared in
his discourse, shevved it self in all his actions; and one would have thought,
that he went out of slavery in going out of Genoua, and that Monaco was not
only the place of his birth, but that he was attended there to be declared the
Conqueror of all Nations, to receive the honor of a Triumph, and to mount into
a Throne; that he was also expected by the Princess for to be crowned, not by
the hands of fortune, but by those of love. And whereas he had not so much
ambition, as desire to be beloved, the Empire of all the Earth could not have
given him a joy so sensible, as that of the heart of Isabella. This Princess
imagining rightly, that Justiniano would not be long before he came to see her,
had given order at the Port, that as soon as a Galley should be discovered from
Genoua-ward, she should be advertised of it, being persuaded that they would
not let Iustiniano come in a Feluca; so that when he appeared, notice was
thereof given the Princess, and at the same instant all the wall was set on
fire with a valley of Musket shot; all the great Ordnance likewise was
discharged, the dreadful noise whereof could not keep Justiniano from being
pleasingly assured, that those flames were an effect of them which love had
kindled in the heart of Isabella, who presently dispatched away the principal
of her servants, and the most considerable of the Inhabitants of Monaco, to go
to receive him, and present him with the keys of the Town-Gates. This obliging
ceremony so mightily surprised Justiniano, when it was done unto him, that he
could hardly find terms to express his resentment thereof, and the confusion
whereinto this so gallant and extraordinary a favor had put his spirit. He
besought those that were sent from Isabella to excuse him, if he did not accept
of that which they offered him, since it would not be just, that he, who would
hold himself too much honored to be their Princesses subject, should do an act
of their Sovereign; that for the incivility which he committed in refusing a
thing that came from her, he conjured them to conduct him where she was, that
he might give her thanks, and crave pardon of her both at once. They were a
pretty while in this dispute of courtesy on either side; but at last Justiniano
remained firm in his resolution. They began then to take that winding way which
leads to the Town, and where all the soldiers of the Garrison were ranged
into two files for him to pass thorough the midst of them, and so he marched
till he came to the Portall of the Castle, where the Princess attended him.
When as first he appeared she advanced to receive him, so that to save her some
stepps, and to follow his inclination, he went as fast as possibly he could,
and kissed her roab. It was at this instant that those perfect Lovers felt that
which cannot be expressed; and albeit they had resolved on both parts to contain
themselves, and had also prepared their minds for the making of some complement
to one another in this encounter, their silence, and then their interrupted
discourses, made it apparent to all that beheld them, that excess of pleasure
excited such a trouble in their souls, as would not permit them to express all
that they thought; but to conceal this agreeable transport from the eyes of her
subjects, the Princess caused Iustiniano to enter, after she had saluted Doria
with a great deal of civility: When they were arrived at Isabellaes chamber,
all that had accompanied them were obliged by respect to withdraw, two or three
excepted, which remained to entertain Doria, whilst the Princess talked with
Justiniano. Never were two hearts replenished with so much joy; never had two
spirits more charming transports; and never did two amorous persons so
perfectly express the motions of their souls by their only looks; they said
both of them together, and at one instant, that they had always loved one
onother; that they still loved one another; and that they would love one
another eternally: But after this dumb language had made all their
apprehensions to pass from one heart to another, Justiniano began to render the
Princess thanks for all her goodness toward him; but she, not able to suffer
the continuance of this discourse, conjured him to remember, that their
interests could not be separated, and that owing him all things it was unjust
to thank her; especially having done nothing for him, than what she could not
choose but do; namely to weep for his absence, to fear his changing, to
apprehend his loss, and to renounce all the pleasures of this life, since she
could not have that of seeing him. Justiniano answered thereunto, that this
necessity, which she had imposed upon her self, was so fair a mark of her
affection, and so glorious for him, that unless he should be the most
ungrateful of men, he was obliged to thank her eternally; As for the rest, her
tears being of so inestimable a price, she must not find it strange, if being
unable to render her any service that could merit that honor, he resolved at
least to tell her often, that he knew well he was unwor- of it. This
conversation was interrupted by the Sergeant-major of the Garrison, who
according to the commandment which the Princess had given him for it, came to
demand the word of Justiniano; this Gallanterie surprised him as pleasingly, as
the former which had been done him upon his landing at the Port; and as he was
no less civil, than Jsabella was obliging, he said unto her with a low voice,
and beholding her with eyes full of love, and respect, that a man, who knew not
how to rule his desires, and that would die her Slave, was not in a state to
command others: But what reason soever he could allege, he must obey Isabellaes
pleasure; yet was it not for all that but upon condition, that she should give
the word as well as he, and that he should not, but after her, finish this
mystery of War, which at this time was absolutely guided by love. For as if
these two illustrious persons had agreed together about this gallanterie, the
word, which the Princess gave to the Sergeant-major, was found to be
Justiniano; and that which Justiniano gave, after he had long refused to do
it, was the fair name of Isabella. This conformity of spirit and thought was
equally pleasing unto them; for though they knew not what each of them had
said, yet did they understand it by a complement between them; for Justiniano
assured the Princess, that manger her courtesy Isabella should reign still at
Monaco; and the Princess assured him, that manger his modesty and resistance
Iustiniano was Master of the Town. One part of the evening was spent in a
sumptuous feast, which Isabella made him in the great Hall of the Castle; and
for the rest of it all their conversation was nothing but promises of loving
one another eternally; and joy possessed them in such sort, as there came not so
much as one thought unto them of their misfortunes. But whereas it was late,
Iustiniano lead the Princess back to her chamber, followed by Aemilia her
kinswoman, and all her women; as for him he was conducted by the Officers of
Isabella to a lodging, which she had caused to be prepared for him, and where
the riches of the furniture made it appear, that she had omitted nothing for
the receiving of him magnificently. The image of Isabella so fully possessed
his mind, as that of Constantinople never came into his thought; the
remembrance of what was past, nor the fear of that to come, could not trouble
his pleasures; and his present happiness so enchanted his reason, as without
considering that this supreme felicity, occasioned by the sight of Isabella,
would precipitate him ere long into an extreme misfortune, he past the night
without any other unquietness, than that which he received by the impatience he
was in to see day, that he might see Isabella again. Doria was also conducted
into a chamber which was little less stately than that of his Illustrious
friend, who to entertain himself more commodiously in his amorous fancies had
desired to lie alone.

IBRAHIM, OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The First Part. The Fifth Book.
ISabella was no sooner awake but she thought of Justiniano, and to entertain
him with the more liberty, she sent to demand of him by way of complement,
whether he would be pleased to go and pass away a part of the day in a fair
Garden, which the Princes of Monaco have on the Seaside; and whereas he had no
other will than that of the Princess, he answered him who came from her, that
so as he might have the honor to see her he would obey her with joy, her
presence having this particular charm, that she rendered all places alike
agreeable unto him, because he never considered any thing therein but her. This
match being made, this fair Troop, as soon as dinner was done, began their
walk; Justiniano lent Isabella his hand for to support her down to the Garden,
whither one may easily go on foot, Doria did the like to Aemilia, and the rest
of the women together with the Princesses chiefest Officers followed after.
Their journey being short, they quickly arrived whither they were to go; where
at first their talk was of the beauty of the place, of the situation thereof,
of the ornaments which had been added to its natural graces, and other
indifferent things; but as soon as the Princess had handsomely drawn Justiniano
a pretty way from the Troop, she conjured him to acquaint her with his
adventures, and no longer to defer the satisfying her curiosity, in recounting
particularly unto her all the circumstances of a life wherein she had so much
interest, as to make it thenceforward the felicity of hers. This discourse
surprised Justiniano at first, he would have excused himself for that day,
beseeching the Princess not to deprive him so soon of the delight he had in
hearing her talk; but at length, seeing that this reason did not content her,
he yielded unto it. They entered then into a great green Arbor, which on the one
side looked toward the Sea, and whereas Isabella, being set down on a seat of
green Turf, perceived that Doria would out of respect have withdrawn as well as
the rest of the Troop, she stayed him, and said, that as he had been the
testimony of their first flames, it was but just that he should be so too of
their last adventures: She made him then sit down by Justiniano, and when the
rest of the company were retired a good way from Isabella, she summoned
Justiniano to the performance of his word; who, after he had besought her to
pardon him, if the disorder of his fortune did make some at any time in his
discourse, began to speak in this sort.

The Sequel of the History of Iustiniano.
THe cause of all my miseries being a crime which you have pardoned, I think
you will have so much goodness as not to oblige me to confess once more unto
you, that which I have written to you heretofore: I will not tell you then how
after I had by an hundred apparent reasons confirmed my self in the belief that
you lived no longer but for the Prince of Masseran, despair seized so strongly
on my spirit, that death was the term of all my desires; but to get far away
speedily from a place, where I could suspect the most constant person that ever
was of infidelity, suffer me to tell you in few words, that quitting Germany, I
imbarqued my self on the Baltique Sea, to seek out an honorable death in the
war of Sweden; that on the way I was taken prisoner by Chairadin King of
Algier, who sold me soon after to the Bassa Sinan, which caused me instantly to
be conducted to Constantinople, with three hundred other Slaves, whereof he
meant to make a present to the Grand Signior. It is in that place, Madam, where
fortune has done such strange, and so unlikely things, as albeit they arrived
unto me, yet do I doubt many times, in thinking of my adventures, whether it be
not an effect of my depraved imagination that represents them so unto me, or a
faithful report of my memory; but not to lose time in exagerating the
phantasticalness of fortune, which has been but too well known by all Ages,
and all Nations, and to give you an extraordinary proof of it in my person, you
shall understand, that after I was come to Constantinople, laden with irons, as
well as my companions, without any difference betwixt us, but that they tried
every day to break their chains, and that I bore mine with a tranquillity of
mind, yet melancholic withal, which made them perceive that life and liberty
were not the object of my desires; this knowledge which they had of my
apprehensions during the voyage, was the cause that they concealed from me the
resolution they had taken, when we were come to Constantinople, of killing
their Guard, that so they might save themselves ere they should be presented to
the Grand Signior; and they carried their design so well, as it was not
discovered above two hours before it should have been executed. And whereas
amongst the Turks the desire of liberty is a capital crime in a Slave, unless
it be in paying a ransom for it, this enterprise being proved against them, the
Bassa Sinan, a violent man, and that saw how in one only night he was like to
have lost three hundred Slaves, without examining the circumstances of the
matter, without distinguishing the guilty from the innocent, condemned us all
to be exposed to the cruellest punishment of that Country. This Sentence was
received diversely, according to the diversity of minds, but at last, though
there were some generous soldiers amongst that great number of Slaves, yet
heard they all this woeful news with grief: As for me, who did not desire to
live longer, because I saw my self constrained to live without you, I beheld
the end of my life as an assured port to shelter me from all the storms
wherewith I was agitated; so that though it had been easy for me to have
exempted my self from this peril, by letting the Bassa know what ransom I
could have paid him, yet had I no purpose so to do. Howbeit this general
consternation endured not long, for the Bassa Sinan coming to consider that he
could not satisfy his revenge and his avarice both together, resolved not to
lose that himself which others would have taken from him; and therefore for
examples sake only, he commanded that we should draw lots, and that the tenth
part of our number should expiate the crime of the rest. This grace was
received with joy by all the company; and albeit fear had still some place in
their souls, yet was hope the povverfuller, and persuaded them all in
particular, that the misfortune should not fall upon them: In the mean time the
lots were drawn, and chance having decided the matter, I was of the number of
the thirty that were to die. It was then that I well observed, how human
weakness is the cause why every one is in some sort comforted by having
companions in his misery; for when we were all condemned, I saw nothing but
tears of sorrow, but as soon as the lot had separated the fortutunate from the
unfortunate, these last changed their sorrow into rage, and choler so
transported them, as they could not endure the sight of them that were
delivered: Yet was it not they whom destiny reserved for this supreme disgrace;
for the Bassa having moderated his fury, would have our lives once more depend
absolutely upon the caprichiousness of fortune; he ordained then, t^^t of
thirty which we were, no more than three should suffer; and the lot so favored
the desire I had to die, that I was one of those unhappy men, according to the
sense of others, though in mine own heart I was of a contrary opinion. The two
that proved my companions in this sad adventure, were without doubt the
worthiest of all the slaves, they were young, handsome, and courageous, and even
such as the very Excutioners themselves, who were to take away our lives, had
some regreet to see, that chance had made a choice so unjust according to their
thinking, so that one of them moved with compassion, went and advertised the
Bassa, that in losing us he would lose the properest slaves that were in
Constantinople, and the fittest to make a present of to his Highness. The
Bassa, who repented him already of his violence, in regard of his own interest,
and yet desired that some one of us should be punished, resolved at length for
the last cast, that of we three but one should dye, and that according to the
first order, chance should still be the absolute master of our life or of our
death. The lot was not more favorable to me in this last encounter, than in
all the former, and I was the sacrifice destined for the public s fety; I was
then presently bound more straightly than before; they made me my self carry the
preparations of my punishment; and without boasting I can avow, that I faced
death with tranquillity enough: I dare not almost say, that in this woeful
estate you were the only object of my thought, yet it is true how I imagined,
that this obstinacy of fortune, in choosing me still to be sacrifised, was an
effect of your desire, and that she did not judge me unworthy to live, but
because you judged me unworthy of your affection. In the end I received this
sentence, as if it had been pronounced by you, and in that thought I went to my
punishment with so much resolution, as bred wonder and compassion in them that
beheld me. As for my self, I was far from being afflicted at mine own proper
miseries; I had some delight in my fetters and chains; and the very sight of
death could not keep me from having some happy moments; for my love, doing its
last and uttermost endeavor, in following me to the grave, persuaded me, that
if you had seen the same Justiniano, upon whom at other times you had
accumulated glory, be ready to yield up the ghost in adoring you, with the most
cruel torments that the rage of tyrants has ever invented, you would at
leastwise have breathed forth some sighs, and shed some tears. The Princess,
not able to endure that he should continue this discourse any longer, so much
trouble did this deadly image excite in her soul, assured him with a great deal
of tenderness, and her eyes full of tears, that this narration touched her so
sensibly, as albeit she could not doubt but that he had escaped this peril,
yet could she not choose but be in fear for him, and feel such a grief in her
mind, as she was not able to express. Justiniano was no less moved with the
tears of the Princess, than she had been by his relation; and when he had
rendered her thanks for so generous an apprehension, Doria told him, that he
could not better acquit himself of that devoire, than to acquaint her by what
enchantment he got out of this adventure. Isabella having testified by her
action, that Doriaes impatience was hers, Justiniano prosecuted his History in
this manner. Since your Excellency will know how I was delivered, I am to let
you understand, that to go from the place where my doom had been pronounced, to
that where it was to be executed, we were of necessity to pass by one of the
faces of the Seraglio, and my good luck would have it, that when we came to
that part, the Sultana Asteria, great Solimans daughter, was leaning at a
window, whereof she had pulled up the grate, and seeing a far off the multitude
of people which accompanied me, and who seemed by their carriage to take part
with my misfortune, it chanced that she cast her eye upon my face, and that she
found something in it which begot a curiosity in her, whereupon she commanded
them that conducted me to stay, and demanded of them what crime I had
committed; I knew afterward (for then I understood not the language very well)
that one amongst them told her I was innocent, and recounted unto her by what
mishap I was in that estate, by aggravating with a great deal of vehemence the
obstinacy of fortune in choosing me still, and the constancy which I had showed
in this encounter. As long as this discourse lasted I observed that she
considered me very attentively, so that perceiving by some words which I had
already learned during the voyage, and by her gesture, that she spoke of me,
and that she pitied me, I saluted her with a profound respect. At length,
Madam, the young Sultana Asteria was so compassionate and generous, that after
she had asked, and knew of what Nation I was, she expressly charged them that
conducted me, not to stir from thence till they had order from the Grand
Signior her father. They, who knew both the rank and credit, which the Sultana
had with Soliman, were careful not to fail in obeying her; in the mean time
she went to the Emperor her father, who was then very luckily in the old
Seraglio, where she was, and which is not inhabited but by the Mothers,
Sisters, Daughters, and Aunts of the Grand Signior: There she besought him to
grant her the life of a slave, that was an Italian, and innocent, whom the
Bassa Sinan had purposed to have presented unto him, but now would put him to
death only to serve for an example. After she had obtained the effect of her
prayer, she rested not there, for she reported so many things of my constancy
and resolution to Soliman, as it begot a desire in him to see me; so that
sending a command to deliver me, I received order by a Trucheman to go unto the
Grand Signior. To tell you, Madam, what this change wrought in me would be to
no end, since it is easy for you to judge, that he, who so much despised life,
received it not with much joy; and I dare say, that I stood in more need of
constancy to resolve to live, than another would have had to resolve to die:
Howbeit I went to his Highness, and whatsoever aversion I had from life, yet
did I not forbear rendering him thanks for granting it to me. When first I
appeared before Soliman he began to speak to me; for whereas he knew before
that I was of Italy, he believed that I would understand a language, which at
Constantinople they call the Franks tongue, and spoken there by every one for
the commodity of commerce, and which also I understood perfectly, because it
is no other than a corrupted Italian. It was not, for that this Prince, out of
an extraordinary curiosity proper to those of his Nation, is not acquainted,
not only with all the Oriental tongues, but with the Spanish, the French, and
the Italian; howbeit in regard he does not exercise them, he understands them
only, without being able to speak them with facility: nevertheless I must for
the present except the last, which in consideration of me he learned afterward
very perfectly. It was then in that language, whereof I have spoken, that he
demanded of me whence I was, what was my birth and profession, and by what
adventure I came into the power of the Bassa Sinan. I answered him that I was a
poor Italian Gentleman, whose life had nothing remarkable enough wherewith to
entertain so great a Prince; and that the only chance of War had made me a
slave at Argier, where the Bassa had bought me not long after. I confess I had
somewhat ado to disguise the truth, but being resolved that I would never be
heard spoken of more, I did not tell what I was, for fear if it had been known,
and that it had been discovered how I could have given a sufficient great
ransom, intelligence would have been sent to Genoua of my being at
Constantinople. Soliman told me then, that I had something in the air of my
face, that showed me greater than I had delivered my self to be, and that all
the rules of physiognomy were false, or I had not spoken sincerely unto him. I
received this discourse with a great deal of respect and modesty; after which
he talked to me of the customs of my country, of war, of fortifications, and
when he perceived by my answers that I was not absolutely ignorant, though in
this occasion I was not forward to show my self very knowing, or of any great
wit; there is not any good art, or excellent science, which he did not
discourse with me about, for the space of two hours that I had the honor to be
with him. At last, Madam, this great Prince was so satisfied of me, as he sent
word to the Bassa Sinan, that having understood he meant to present me unto him
with three hundred slaves, he remitted unto him not only his three hundred
slaves, but assured him that he would give him also as many more for a
recompense of the service he had done him, in bringing me under his obedience:
And when he had ordained that care should be taken of me, he did me the grace
to tell me, that I had so nearly touched his inclination, as after he had given
me my life, he would have given me me my liberty too, if he could have resolved
to deprive himself so soon of a person, which was agreeable to him. I must
confess that this generosity came near my heart, and that I was almost ashamed
to receive so extraordinary a favor with so little testimony of joy; I retired
then infinitely satisfied of this Prince, and I was conducted to the quarter of
the Slaves that were destined to his Highness, although I was not treated like
them, having no other pain than that of wearing my irons. This revolution of
fortune s^emed so strange unto me, when I came to consider it, as I remained
all the night in the admiration of this prodigious adventure: (What said I to
my sel^) has destiny resolved then, that I shall pass from one extremity to
another? It cannot endure mediocritie in my happiness, nor in my unhappiness;
and out of an obstinate rage to persecute me, when it sees that I am resolved
for the greatest misfortunes, and that death passes with me for a sovereign
good, it withdrawes me from that Port, which I held to be most secure, to
expose me to the tempest again by apparent felicities: But it may be too (said
I further sighing) that there is some justice in its cruelty; the temerity
which I have had to love, and to hope to be beloved of the most admirable
person that ever will be, is not yet sufficiently ^unished; grief, despair,
exile, imprisonment, and certainty of death, are not torments proportionable
enough to my crime, which being infinite, demands also an eternal
chastisement: Let us suffer then (continued I) since the incomparable Isabella
is not satisfied, and let us accept of the life, which is given us for a
punishment, and not for a grace. It was after this manner, Madam, that I
resolved to receive all that fortune prepared for me, with a design no longer
to oppose my reason against her humors, and blindly, and without resistance, to
obey this invisible power, which mocks all human prudence; which puts us into
the Port upon the point of suffering shipwreck; which precipitates us from the
top of happiness into the abysme of misery; which overturnes Thrones; which
destroys Kingdoms; which causes Kings to die; and to say all in a word, which
soveraignly disposes of the whole Universe. This resolution being strongly
established in my mind, I found more tranquillity in my self; and though I was
always infinitely sad, yet for all that it is certain, that my melancholy was
more sociable; and to speak truth, it was in some sort necessary that I should
find my self in this estate; for Soliman failed not to send for me the next day
to talk with him; and this second conversation having satisfied him more than
the first, there past not a day after that, wherein I had not the honor to
confer with him: History, War, Geography, the Mathematiques, Painting, and
Music were the subject of these entertainments: And whereas this Prince loves
the Sciences passionately, and that the Oriental people are not at this day
adicted to them, he was ravished to see that one of his Slaves was not ignorant
in all these things; so that I may say with truth, that there was not a man in
all his Empire, whom he esteemed more than my self. In the mean time I am to
let your Excellency understand, since you will know all my fortune, that in
Galatia, in the same place where was heretofore Angori, which the Ancients
called Seuleucia, and which the Turks at this present name Gielas-il, by
corruption of speech, there is an infinite multitude of Mohammedan Religious
men, called Deruistars, comprehending under that name all the diverse kinds of
those Solitaries, which are found amongst them; but amongst the rest there are
of them, which are termed Calenders, who are of a different sect from the
Deruis, and that make a more particular profession of continency and
austeritie: Of the number of these Calenders was one Zellebis, that is to say,
a Noble man, descended from Chaz-Bectas, or Chaz-Hassen, who lived in the time
of Orchan, second Emperor of the Turks, and that in his religion had been the
Disciple and Sectarie of one Edebal, who was the first institutor of all those
Mohammedan devotions, which prophesied the Empire to Othoman, and his
successors; and who in his time had been held for a man of a very holy life: So
that this Calender Zellebis, of whom I speak, a stirring and active man,
relying on the reputation of his Predecessors, began to gain unto him all those
of his sect, which were no small number; and under the name and pretext of
liberty, he made almost all Natolia to revolt. Soliman, being advertised
thereof, failed not in sending a mighty Army thither; but the chance of War so
favored those revolters, as they defeated it in diverse incounters, and also
killed some Sangiaes, or Governors of Provinces, who would have opposed
themselves to this sedition, which under the pretext of the sanctity of those
that raised it, might at length have proved dangerous to the Turkish Empire.
The news of the last defeat of the Grand-Signiors Troops was brought him a
little while after I had the honor to belong unto him: And whereas the bad
success of this Civil War touched him more vively, than the loss of a battle
in a strange War would have done, he resolved to go in person to punish these
rebels. And whereas he did not believe, that these seditious were so daring,
as to oppose him, he gave not himself the time to raise one of those puissant
Armies, which strikes terror into all the word, but contented himself with
joining his ordinary Guard, and some other Troops, which he took out of the
Garrisons, whereby he passed to those that had rallied themselves together after
the last defeat. When he was ready to depart, he commanded me to follow him,
though none of the rest of the Slaves besides had order to go: I will not tell
you, Madam, all the particulars of this War; for whereas I recount mine own
History, and not that of the Grand-Signior, I am to speak only of those
things, wherein I have some interest: You shall understand then, that Zellebis,
the Chief of this sedition, being fallen sick, had forsaken the Camp, and was
retired into the Capital City of Natolia, with the best Troops of his Army;
whereof Soliman having been advertised, he resolved to go and besiege him; not
doubting but if he could get him into his hands he should easily prevail over
all the rest. This design, having been approved of, was not long before it was
executed; we marched directly to this City; approches to it are made; trenches
are cast up; batteries are raised; and in a few days the avenues to it are so
well closed up, as it is impossible for any body to go in or out. At length,
to abridge this narration, Zellebis, being in a short time recovered, defended
himself so courageously, that after he had sustained three assaults with great
loss of ours, the besieged were still in case to make sallies every day, which
extremely incommodated our Army. During all these passages I had diverse times
besought his Highness to permit me to venture my life for his service, which I
could not obtain, because a Slave is not suffered to bear arms: I lived then in
this sort with a great deal of vexation, to see my self in a shameful idleness
at such a time, when as occasions were so often presented, wherein I might have
dyed Nobly. As I was in this melancholy, the Grand-Signior, being much incensed
to see this Town hold out so long, resolved that his Army should perish there,
or carry it by force; and for that effect he caused a general assault to be
given: And though there were a body of the enemies Army in the field, he
commanded nevertheless that they should not care so much for the guard of the
Trenches, as for the attacquing of the place; and the reason of this was,
because the enemy had never appeared, nor had used endeavor, either to cast
Troops into the City, or to raise the siege. In the mean time it happened, that
an hour after the assault was begun, and that above twenty times there had been
already lost, and regained, five or six foot of ground, which was to render
Soliman Master of the Town, there was heard, notwithstanding the dreadful
noise of Cannons, of arms, and of the cries of them that fought, toward the
Grand-Signiors quarter a great volley of musket shot, which put much fear into
our soldiers hearts. Soliman, who was present at this fight for to give
direction in person, confirmed them the best that possibly he could, and after
he had commanded the Bassa Sinan to continue the assault, he went to see what
the matter was, followed only by two thousand Janisaries, but he was quickly
cleared in it, for he had not marched fifty paces, but that he saw the rest of
his soldiers come in disorder, having avoided the fury of the enemy, who was
pursuing them still. Soliman no longer doubted then but that this was Zellebis
his Army which attacqued his Camp; and being a Prince of a great and generous
spirit, he purposed to fight with them: But as he was ready to march directly
to the enemy, he was much surprised to behold from the Towns side, that not
only his soldiers had abandoned the assault, but that Zellebis in the head of
those of Chientaya, went beating them before him in a terrible disorder. As for
me, who always followed the Prince without other arms than a light chain, which
I wore on one of my legs, I assuredly believed that he was lost, as indeed
without almost a supernatural assistance it is certain that he could not have
escaped: He was closed up in the midst of his enemies, his Army was dispersed,
fear had seized upon his Troops, and if an advantageous plot of ground had not
been met withal to put part of his Forces, and his Person in safety, this
mischief had been without remedy. But, Madam, must I tell you how it was by my
means, that this day, so unlucky in the beginning, had a glorious end? Yes,
Madam, I must tell it you, and since my valor was but an effect of my despair,
and that you were the cause thereof, it is just to let you understand how it
was by you that I saved both the life, and the glory of great Soliman. Remember
then, if you please, this verity in the process of this Narration, to the end I
may not be accused of vanity in delivering things which I had not executed
without you: I shall tell you then, Madam, that in this universal disorder I
conserved so much judgment to observe, that on the left hand of that quarter
where we were, there was a place which Nature had so well fortified, as with
very little defense it was impossible to be forced; I advanced then boldly to
the Grand Signior, and maugre the press I let him see what I had already noted,
and caused him to perceive, that in attending the rallying of his troops he
might be there not only in assurance, but in an estate to keep those of the
town from joining with them that were without. This advice having satisfied
him, he commanded to go and seiz on that plot; but as if the enemy had been
acquainted with this design he advanced to dispute it with us. There it was,
Madam, that I ceased to be slave for to be a soldier, for having taken a
scimitar which I found amongst the dead bodies, I got into the head of our
troops, with so much resolution, and so much good fortune, as I did things
there which I dare not relate: in the end, Madam, I inspired our soldiers with
such valor, as reasuming courage we repulsed the enemy, and seized on the
place, whereof I have already spoken to you. But when I saw Soliman in safety,
I went and cast my self amidst some of our forces, which were fighting still
with those that were come out of the City; and perceiving that our soldiers
were preparing to fly, in hope to get to the place where Soliman was, I
threatened to kill them if they returned not to the fight: This so extraordinary
a discourse being seconded by some effects, which seemed mavelous unto them,
they resolved to follow me: Behold me then the head of this courageous Brigade,
whom I conducted so fortunately, as I made them carry that in two hours, which
a whole Army could not do in six weeks before. At last, Madam, being resolved
to perish, or do some great matter, I so hotly pursued the enemies, that after
we had killed a great number of them, made the rest to fly, and put fear into
all the remainder, I drove them even into their town, where being entered alone
with them, certainly I performed things, which made me plainly see, that
despair is more powerfuller than valor; but whatsoever I could have done,
doubtless I should have fallen there if I had not called to mind, that the
breach being abandoned, I might through that place cause our forces to enter;
thither I made then with extreme speed, and finding none on the Ramparts but
disarmed people, who were there assembled to see the success of the business, I
easily got to it, and presently discovering those which had followed me to the
City-gate, I cried unto them, Victory, Victory, for to oblige them to turn head
toward me: When as they knew me by my slaves habit, they were so surprised to
see me still living, as no way doubting but that I was a man sent by their
Prophet to succor them, they resolved to abandon me no more; and superstition
mingled it self so happily amongst them to excite their valor, as I can say
that I never saw soldiers more courageous: They came then unto me with
incredible speed, and were no sooner mounted on the breach but I pulled down an
Ensign, which the enemies had set up on the wall, to put one of Solimans in the
place of it; and having left some for the guard of the breach, I went with the
rest to seize on the gates of the town, and their Magazine of Arms. The people
no sooner heard long-live victorious Soliman cried in the streets, but their
weapons sell out of their hands, assuredly believing that their Army was
defeated, and that the Emperors was in the City: In the mean time Zellebis used
all his endeavor to put heart into his soldiers again, but seeing it
altogether impossible, he resolved to fly, fearing nothing so much as to fall
alive into Solimans hands. As soon as the people knew that their Defendor had
forsaken them, we had no further resistance, except at the Gates, where some
soldiers were still in the guard of them; this obstacle stayed us not long,
for whereas we fought then with hope that the victory would fall to the juster
side, we redoubled our efforts with so much ardour, as at last we became
Masters of the place. Things being in this estate, and perceiving that I had
not force enough to keep the people under, I thought fit to advertise Soliman
of it, who in the mean while had rallied one part of his Army, which at
length proved strong enough to vvithstand the Enemy, but not to repulse him,
had not the happy nevvs which I sent them redoubled their courage: Soliman
caused the taking of the City then to be presently published amongst the
Troops, and promised them the pillage of it if they performed their duty well.
After this, Madam, they marched with a resolution, which certainly was a
presage of the victory had the enemies stood to it, but having turned their
eyes to the City, and seeing on the walls an Ensign with the Arms of the Empire
in it, their courage began to abate, and soon after to give place unto fear;
for Zellebis upon his flying away had sent them word, that they should not
hazard a Battle, for that the Town was lost, so that they retired; and
although that Soliman pursued them a while, their Chieftain was so cunning in
his Trade, as it was impossible to engage them in the fight, or to keep them
from making an honorable retreat; for Soliman beholding from an eminent place,
that they were going to take a wood, where it would have been dangerous to
pursue them, and seeing likewise that it was almost night, he returned to the
Camp: And whereas he had already sent me troops enough, that I might no longer
fear the revolt of this people, I went to assure him that I had taken such
order, as he might by the breach enter into this rebellious Town. To tell you,
Madam, how this Prince received me would be an impossible thing; he caressed me
with so much goodness, he commended me so highly, and said so many times that
he owed both his life and his honor unto me, as his praise far surpassed that
which I had done: And observing that I had still a piece of the chain on, which
I had brought back with me, from the fight, he commanded it instantly to be
taken off. But seeing that he could not forbear speaking of me, and always
asking me some particularity of this action, I besought him to think rather of
conserving that which fortune had given him by my hand, than any further to
commend a victory, for which he was more engaged to his own good hap, than to
my valor. This Prince grew suddenly silent hereupon, whereof I could not
imagine the cause; but I was not long in this uncertainty, for Soliman after he
had mused a little, began to speak, and tell me, how he was much troubled that
his Religion would not permit him to give any command to such a man as I was,
and that it forced him to do an injustice, and to show himself ungrateful, by
conferring that on another which I had acquired. I besought him then to
believe, that if his Highness was satisfied, so was I, and that I aspired to no
other glory than that of pleasing and serving him. He appointed the Saniac of
Natolia then to go and command in the Town; and lest the fear of chastisement
should carry the Inhabitants to any revolt, he charged him to keep the
soldiers all night in Arms, and he ordained the same in his Camp, the Enemies
not being so far off, but that it might be feared they might make use of the
advantage which the obscurity of the night gave them to come and beat up some
of our Quarters. After this he made a sign for every one to withdraw; I would
have obeyed like the rest, but he let me know that this Commandment extended
not to me, and that he desired I should stay with him. It was then, Madam, that
Soliman surmounted my insensibility, by forcing me to begin to serve him with
amity, and not with a simple acknowledgement, as I had done before; and indeed
to speak truth, one must have renounced all reason not to have been moved with
so much generosity. He entreated me not as his Slave; he spoke not to me as to
his inferior; he caressed me not as his equal, but as if I had been an
hundred degrees above him, both in my birth, in my merit, and in my valor: And
to testify unto me that this discourse was not a flattery wherewith he meant
to recompense me, he swear to me that it would be long of me if I did not reign
in his Empire as absolutely as he himself, and conjured me to furnish him with
the means for it, because without me he should be constrained to be
ungrateful, fortune being so much his enemy, as he could not do good to the
only man he loved, if I were not willing to it also. At last, Madam, after an
hundred of the most conjuring protestations that can be imagined, and after he
had prayed me above an hundred times not to think ill of him for the
proposition he was going to make me, he undertook to persuade me to quit my
Religion for to embrace his, because, said he, without that he must be
ungrateful, I must be a slave, and he must likewise be the most unhappy of
men, there not being a more cruel adventure (continued he) for a generous
Prince, than not to be able to recompense a gallant action, and to be
constrained to leave a person in servitude whom he loves, and whom he esteems
so much, as to divide his Empire with him. After that this Prince had said all
that generosity and affection could make one to say in a like encounter, I
besought him not to afflict himself unjustly, since I was going to give him the
means to recompense me, not only for the services I had rendered him, but for
all those which I should render him in time to come. Hereupon such a joy
appeared in his face, as fully assured me that he had expressed the meaning of
his heart; but it continued not long, when as I humbly desired him to restore
me my chains, and to leave me to the liberty of my Religion; that I demanded
irons of him, to testify that I would not go out of his service: and that I
besought him not to ask any more of me a thing, which I would not do for the
possession of the Empire of the whole world, for fear I should be enforced to
displease and disobey him. What! said Soliman unto me, shall I give chains to
my Deliverer? shall I retain him still to be a Slave that makes me to reign?
shall I bind the hands of him that has crowned me? and with a strange
injustice shall I make him a captive that has made me victorious? No, no, it
shall not be said, that I could not recompense them, that have served me, but
with a shameful servitude: The demand, which thou have made me, is worthy of
thy generosity, but this recompense would be unworthy of Soliman. He had
questionless proceeded further, had he not observed my countenance to change,
and fearing that he had displeased me, he began to ask me pardon, when as I
perceived that I was wounded in the left arm by the blood that trickled out of
the sleeve of my habit, so that doubting that I would fall into a swoon he
called in company; and notwithstanding any thing I could say he would needs
see my wound searched, which was not found dangerous, but which might have been
so, had the dressing of it been any longer retarded. It is a strange thing that
I did not perceive it, and if the proposition which Soliman made unto me, had
not moved me so violently, as to make my wound burst out a bleeding, I believe
that I had gone away without heeding it. Soliman caused me to be carried into a
Tent, with so great a care, as one would have said, that on the conservation of
my life depended that of his. I began then to be no longer regarded as a Slave,
but as the favorite of the Emperor; every one observed and caressed me, and
even he that had bought me, that had laid me in irons, and had condemned me to
die, was one of the most careful of my health. In the mean time Soliman entered
the next day into the Town with all the ceremonies of a Prince, that is
Vanquisher of his rebellious subjects: The principal inhabitants were brought
before him bound in chains, and prostrated with their faces on the ground; he
informed himself presently of the quality of their crime; he distinguished
those, that had revolted out of malice, from those that had been engaged in it
out of weakness, and by a goodness quite contrary to the maxims of Tyrants,
the lives of five or six of the most culpable satisfied for the offense of all
the rest; and he showed an example of clemency; where others would have showed
one of cruelty under the name of justice. But whereas he had promised the
pillage of the Town to the soldiers, he would not give them cause to complain
in a time when as the enemy was still in the field; neither would he also let
them charge themselves with booty, knowing well that the enriching of an Army
is the destroying of it; so that to content them, he caused them to be told,
that he was ready to keep his promise with them, but judging it not fit,
Zellebis having escaped from his revenge, that they should load themselves with
unprofitable lumber, since they could neither carry it away, nor sell it, being
constrained to follow the enemy; he offered to give each of them three months
pay, and promised them besides not to return to Constantinople without
recompencing their courage. The soldiers accepted of this proposition, and
that they might not have leisure to repent them, Soliman made them march away
three days after, having left a strong Garrison in the Town to hinder any new
rebellion. He had the goodness to desire to know almost every hour in what
estate I was, so that having been assured my wound would not keep me from
following him, he testified a great deal of joy for it. We marched then
directly to the enemy, having discovered by our scouts where he was: But
whereas Zellebis, who had joined himself to his Troops, would not hazard a
battle lightly, he always avoided with dexterity every place, where he might
be enforced to fight; and as he was cunning and malicious, so he invented a
trick that succeeded happily with him. He saw well, that the Grand Signiors
presence was the soul of his Army; that his very sight inspired valor into his
soldiers; and that it would be hard to vanquish them, as long as he should be
a witness of their courage; that he alone could heap wealth and honor on them:
He sent then with all speed some of his faction to Constantinople, to sow a
rumor there that Soliman was dead; that his Troops were defeated; and that he
was declared Emperor; making no question, out of the knowledge he had of the
Janissaries turbulent humor, which always remained for the guard of the
Seraglio, but that they would make some disorder, that might recall Soliman to
Constantinople; as indeed this sad and false news was no sooner published
there, but it presently begot a terrible confusion. The Grand Vizier did all
that he could, to learn from whence this rumor was come, to appease the
Janissaries, assuring them that he had no notice at all of what they were made
to believe; but that, which he thought to retain them by, did but incense them
the more, and confirm them in their opinion. For (said they) if Soliliman were
not dead, the report of his victories would reach even hither; in conclusion,
the whole Seraglio, and all the people were in tears, and all the Janissaries
in arms: But when the Grand Vizier, seconded by some of the people, and by some
of the Janissaries, would have opposed them, they turned all their fury,
according to their custom, against the Jews and the Christians, they plundered
all their houses, they demolished their Chappells, they set some of them on
fire, and in this confusion making no distinction betwixt a Turk and a
Christian, little lacked but that they had pillaged all Constantinople, yea
they almost durst enterprise to force the Seraglio. But in the midst of this
disorder the Grand Vizier received a Letter from Soliman, which advertised him
of the happy success of his Arms, to the end he should advertise his Subjects
therewith, so that being assured of the verity of the matter, he went into the
streets, crying aloud, that Soliman lived, that Soliman was victorious, and
that Soliman would be suddenly at Constantinople. He pronounced these words
with so much joy, as they made some impression in the minds of the Janissaries;
and having showed the Grand Signiors Letter to some of them, this truth was no
longer doubted of any body. The most seditious and the most insolent were the
most amazed; the name of Soliman restored to them that respect which avarice
and violence had banished from them; they threw down their arms, and craved
pardon; howbeit there were some of them, who fearing to render that which they
had taken away, made strange Propositions: But the Grand Vizier being wise and
prudent, thought it would be better to make them hope for Grace, than to make
them stand in dread of chastisement, for fear lest putting them in despair they
should be carried again to some new violence. He promised them then to speak to
the Grand Signior for them, and to assure him that the news of his death had so
afflicted them, as not able to be revenged on those who they believed had
caused it, they would at least be revenged on the enemies of his Religion: This
discourse began to calm their spirits, and whereas this multitude seems always
in such like encounters to have but one soul, which makes them operate, though
they be composed of persons of different thoughts, they suffered themselves at
length to be persuaded that their crime should not only be unpunished, but also
be recompensed, as a mark of their zeal and affection. In the mean time the
Grand Vizier dispatched away with speed to Soliman to advertise him of this
disorder, and to beseech his Highness if his affairs would permit it, to return
unto Constantinople, for fear some new sedition should arise there; how it was
unlikely, that the Christians, Jews, and such Turks as had been plundered,
should not complain of the outrage had been done them, and that these
complaints should not be pursued with a new mischief: He informed him also,
that the affairs of Hungary went not very well, and that his presence was
necessary for the good of things. Soliman received this unpleasing news with a
great deal of grief, being sorry to leave the victory over Zellebis to another,
howbeit he judged his return to be of too great importance to be deferred; so
that after he had given the command of the Army to the Bassa Sinan, and
instructed him with the order that he would have him to hold, we departed for
Constantinople with as little company as possibly we could, to the end the Army
might not be weakened, I say we departed, Madam, for since that fortunate day
wherein my despair was so advantageous for me, I was inseparable from Soliman;
I had a part in all his secrets, he told me all his thoughts, and my advices,
and my counsels made up most of his resolutions. His return to Constantinople
produced many effects there, he gave joy to the innocent, fear to the guilty,
and hope to the Jews and Christians; and truly all these apprehensions were
not ill grounded, for he rewarded those that had been faithful unto him; he
severely punished the seditious; he caused all that had been taken from the
Jews and Christians to be restored to them; he made their Chappells and their
Houses to be re-edified; and for their goods which they had been robbed of, and
could not be found, he paid them with his own money. After this, Madam,
tranquillity was more solidly established in Constantinople, than it was
before; yet did not the Emperor judge it fit to return into Natolia by reason
the affairs of Hungary would not suffer him to be so far absented from it.
During this intervall I had the honor to talk every day with Soliman, and to
receive so many marks of his amity, as I could no longer refuse him mine; but
whatsoever good will he bore me (if I may be permitted to speak so) he could
not forbear persuading me to be of his Religion, whereunto I so strongly
opposed my self, in letting him see the ridiculous errors which it teaches, as
not able to make him angry with me, I forced him many times to laugh at them.
In the mean time it happened, that one morning he sent an extraordinary express
for me, and just as I entered into his chamber, a Bassa, named Rustan, who has
married a daughter of Solimans, and is a cunning and dextrous man, entered in
also with me: When I was come in, Soliman told me, that he had bought a picture
of a Merchant, that was come from Tauris, which he would show me, for to know
whether he had not been cozened, and whether it were true that he had skill in
painting: He gave me then a case covered with Diamonds, which I opened with so
great a transport, as if Soliman had had a quiet spirit he had perceived it;
for, Madam, if one may say, without blasphemy, that there is any thing in the
world which does resemble you, it is certainly this pourtrait; and whereas the
picture which you gave me was taken from me, I believed at first that it was
it, and that to present it to the Grand Signior it had been put into a richer
case; and that which served to deceive me too was, that as you had drawn your
self like an Amazon, so was this also: But at length, after that this first
trouble of mine imagination was appeased, I distinctly perceived that the eyes
of the incomparable Isabella had a fire which did not appear in those of this
picture, and that this resemblance was very imperfect. It is certain
nevertheless, that the whole Orient has never seen so fair a person; also when
Soliman demanded of me, what I thought of it, I was constrained to tell him,
how I did not believe that Greece had ever produced any thing so mavelous.
Thou will not be astonished then, said he unto me, that Soliman is charmed with
it, and that he is resolved curiously to inform himself whether the Original
be as perfect as the Picture; for if the Painter has not flattered this maid,
continued he, I am the most amorous of men, and I cannot live without
possessing her. I confess that this discourse surprised me, for though it might
have been said in a gallantry, yet I certainly knew by the manner of Solimans
speaking that he had his heart touched. He would have me accord with him, that
the Physiogminy of this person was spiritual; that it had a certain air of
Roxelana the Sultana Queen, whom he had so much loved, and for whom he had
still so much respect: I know well, said Soliman unto me, how it is
incomprehensible, that he which has the fairest women of the world in his
power, should become inamoured, it may be of the imagination of a Painter, and
that a mixture of colors, which cannot make but a dumb image, should force me
to forget all the most perfect and the most charming that I have seen, yea, and
Roxelana too, whom I love more than my life. I know well enough besides,
continued he, that this person may be fair, and not be very amiable; that she
may have defects in her mind and in her humor, which her picture does not
show me; that this sweetness which is in her eyes, is not peradventure in her
heart; that this majesty which appears in her face, does cover it may be a
wicked and base soul; and to say all, that she is quite contrary to that I
believe her to be: But in the end I am compelled to this inclination by a
superior power, which will not permit me to vvithstand my self: It is not
because I know not well enough what is reason, but it is because in this
encounter I cannot follovv it: He prayed me that I would counsel him, so as
it were according to his desire. I knevv well by this discourse that this
passion was too violent to be opposed, so as I only said to him, that the f
rst thing which his Highness ought to do was to inform himself where the
Merchant had met with this fair object of his love, to the end he might be
assured the Painter had dealt faithfully. He told me then, how that man had
already acquainted him that this person was named Felixana; that she was the
daughter of the Governor of Mazanderon; that she lived with Axiamira, eldest
daughter to Tachmas, Sophy of Persia, who it was thought was in love with her,
but the report was, that Felixana, by reason of some secret inclination, or for
some reason that was not known, did not receive the affection of that Prince
favorably; wherefore this being so, he resolved to send Rustan in disguise for
to see her, to offer her all the magnificences of the Seraglio; or if she would
not receive them willingly, to bring her away by force, which would not be hard
to do, because he had learnt by another, that the Princess Axiamira, with whom
she lived, went almost every year to Mazanderon, which is situated on the bank
of the Caspian Sea. I saw very well after this discourse, that being generous I
was not to disguise my opinion in so important an occasion; I took then the
liberty to say unto Soliman in the gentlest terms I could choose, that to use
this violence was in some sort to violate the Law of Nations, and to be wanting
to exact justice; and that if Tachmas was never so little sensible of it, the
fire of his love might be likely to kindle that of war; and that peradventure
his Highness might one day repent that a picture had caused the shedding of his
Subjects blood. Rustan, who saw that by destroying the Emperors design I would
take away his employment from him, assured the Grand Signior, that he would put
Felixana into his hands without the Sophy of Persiaes ever discovering what was
become of her; that he knew almost an undoubted mean to execute that which he
had said, provided he would give him a Vessel well furnished with all things
necessary; that he would cause all his soldiers to be attired like Slaves, to
the end they might be the less mistrusted; that as for him, he would also
attire himself like a Merchant, and lade his Vessel with all that was most
rare at Constantinople of the commodities of Europe, and most proper to touch
the inclination of women; that after this he besought his Highness not to
command him to say more, and to be contented with the Oath that he made him to
return him his head at his feet, if he did not bring Felixana. This promise did
so sooth the passion of the Emperor, as not able to keep himself from following
it, he had the goodness to ask my pardon if he did not submit his sense to
mine, telling me how I had at least this advantage, that he confessed I had
reason, and that he would remember how his glory was dear unto me, since I had
been so generous, as not to fear to offend him in opposing my self to the
injustice of his design; that in the mean time we should deal in such sort as
Roxelana might have no notice of it. In the end, Madam, Rustan had the equipage
he required for this goodly conquest, and I had more civilities than I
deserved. Howbeit Soliman was constrained a little after the departure of
Rustan to interrupt his amorous thoughts, for to think of the affairs of
Natolia, which since his return to Constantinopie were very much changed; for
as soon as Zellebis had been advertised by his Spies, that the Emperor was
departed, he took as much care to join with his enemy, as he had used before to
avoid him: And whereas Sinan had order to give battle, when occasion should
serve for it, the two Armies were not long before they incountred together. If
one should always judge of the event of the fight by the number of the
Soldiers, it is certain that the Bassa would have vanquished Zellebis, who had
a great many fewer than he, but he was so unfortunate, and according to some,
of so little understanding, that he let the enemies Army take all the
advantages of the field, whether it were for the situation, or the wind, which
drove all the dust and the smoke in the faces of ours, whereby they were
extremely incommodated. It happened also that when the Battle began, the Sun was
covered with clouds, so that the Bassa Sinan not having observed on which side
it was, or not having foreseen that it might break forth, he placed his
soldiers with their eyes just against it, who soon after perceived that this
light which blinded them, kept them oftentimes from being able either to strike
their enemies, or to avoid their blows. At last, Madam, the Sun cleared the
defeat of the Bassa, and the triumph of Zellebis, and the Emperors Army was so
routed, as in above eight days after a thousand soldiers were not found
together. This news very much afflicted Soliman, and whereas I was the only
confident of his pleasure, and of his grief, I received order to come unto him;
but I was scarcely entered into his Cabinet, when as he fell to asking of me,
whether I would have him dishonored? Whether I had resolved to let that be
lost which I had gotten? Whether I had taken the Capital Town of Natolia to
serve for a retreat to a coward, which had blemished the glory of his Arms? For
at length, said he unto me, the Bassa Sinan is retired thither, after he has
lost a battle, and after he has let mine enemy take the Arms of the Empire:
Now judge, Ibrahim, continued he, what I am to attend from thee; thy valor has
once already established my glory, it is again by thee that I must hold it;
from thy hand it is that I will have the head of Zellebis, and from thy arm
that I look for victory: Oppose thy self no longer then against my will; nor
can I ever resolve that thou should quit me; I love thee too well, or to say
better, I love my self too well to give thee liberty to go out of my State.
Resolve then for that which I have so often demanded of thee, and which I
dare not almost express more clearly unto thee, for fear of grieving thee; at
length Ibrahim, take a Turbant and a Scimitar, and after that, I make thee the
chief of my Empire, mine enemies are subdued, and Soliman is contented. It is
certain, that the manner wherewith this discourse was pronounced somewhat moved
my mind, but it is true nevertheless that it never shaked my soul; I besought
the Emperor not to hearken so much to the affection he bore me, but that he
would also hearken unto reason; that the first blinded his judgment, in
persuading him that I was capable of great things; but the second showed him
clearly, that he demanded of me a thing, not only unjust, but impossible to an
heart as mine was: For, my Lord, said I unto him, our thoughts depend not upon
our wills; that which we call faith amongst us, is a grace that comes from
above, and is not acquired by natural knowledge; it is a thing then which can
not be forced; it is a present from Heaven which is to be conserved with the
peril of ones life, and which is not under the dominion of Kings: Let thy
Highness pardon me then if I refuse thee a thing which I would not do for the
possession of the whole Universe, no nor at the sight of a death, the most
terrible and most dreadful that can be. If I should refuse thee, continued I,
either my blood or my life, which are the only things whereof I can dispose, I
should think my self guilty of the blackest ingratitude that ever was; but
being far from so base a thought, I most humbly beseech thee permit me to go
and affront the Army of the enemy, to try, the first of all, his fury and his
rage, and if it be possible to grapple with Zellebis, and sacrifice his life to
thy vengeance, or mine to thy service. Thy Highness has but too well made
known unto me, how thou remembrest that when I was laden with chains I had the
good fortune to vanquish thine enemies; do thou judge then by what I have done,
of that which I will do in this occasion, whenas so many testimonies of
affection render me indebted to thy Greatness, and that being no longer
fettered with irons, I may make use of all my address, and of all my force: Let
a Scymitar then, my Lord, be only given me, and let me be placed in the foremost
rank of thine Army; and to oblige thy Highness from requiring that only thing
of me which I can refuse thee, do but consider seriously, and consult with thy
most secret thoughts, and then demand of thy self, if the good hap of
Christendom had been such, as that thou were powerfully persuaded of the truth
of our Religion, whether thou would be capable of changing it for the
conquest of all the world: But it is too much importuning thy Highness to ask a
just thing of thee with so many reasons; and it is, as it were, to commit a
crime to make any doubt of obtaining it. Soliman heard me with a great deal of
unquietness, and when I had done speaking he was a pretty while without
answering me: And although the thoughts of men are hard to be known, yet I well
observed, that choler, reason, and amity reigned successively in his heart; but
at length, after he had disputed with himself, he said unto me with somewhat a
more quiet countenance, That not being able to change his mind, nor being able
likewise to rid himself of the affection he bare me, he had found out an
expedient which I could not refuse him, unless I were resolved to incur his
hatred; and which he would grant me, if the Muphti, who is the head of their
Religion, thought he might do it without offending the Prophet. He propounded
then unto me, only to take the habit of the Turks, to the end that being
believed to be so, he might confer Charges upon me, and keep me about him: And
to persuade the people that I had changed my Religion, he would so order it,
that the Muphti should assure all the world, that he had performed the ceremony
of it in private in the Mosque of the Seraglio; that he was confident this man
loved his head too well to reveal a secret of so great importance; that in the
mean time I might live a Christian under the habit of a Mussulman, and render
him the happiest Prince of the Earth. I confess, that I had more ado to answer
to this last proposition, than to the other; howbeit I requested him to
remember, that dissimulation was not to go so far as to the Altars; that love
and war did many times permit such things, but that Religion required much
sincerity; and that in the same which I professed, there was an express
Commandment to publish it openly. I would have proceeded, but choler so
surmounted the Sultan, as I was constrained to hold my peace, for fear of
incensing him further. I well enough perceived, that amity had still a place in
his soul, maugre his fury; I saw tears of spite and kindness in his eyes, and
how violent soever his discourse was he always intermingled things amongst it,
which made me easily discern, that he had an affection for me which could never
be dest^oyed. He said unto me then with a precipitated voice, that I should
make no further reply unto him; that all the grace he could do me was to
permit me to go and consult with the Patriarch of Constantinople, and the
Religious men of Pera, about an occasion wherein they had as much interest as
I; for it may be, said he unto me, after I have favored them so much in
consideration of thee, I may very well destroy them for the same cause, and on
them revenge my self of thy insensibility, and of the anger I am in for that I
cannot leave loving thee, to the end thou might punish thy self: But go,
continued he, and let me hear thy last resolution within two days: for
otherwise I shall be able to take one which may make thee repent, that thou
have so ill acknowledged the affection that I still bear thee, mangre thy
obdurateness. When he had given over speaking, I withdrew with a profound
respect, and considering with my self what I had to do, it seemed just unto me
not to rely upon mine own proper sense in a matter of so great importance.
Those menaces of Soliman would not have shaken me, had they been addressed to
no^e save my self, but the fear of involving so great a number of innocents in
a mischief, which ought not to have regarded any but me, made me resolve to
have recourse unto the reason of others, mine not being free enough, nor
sufficiently disinteressed to operate justly in this encounter. The aversion
which I had for life, being absent from you, helped to persuade me too, that my
Religion permitted not that which was desired of me. I assembled then the
Patriarch of the Greek Church, and his principal Calviers, for the Latin is
not yet established in Constantinople; and whereas I had seen them oftentimes
after I was there, I propounded the matter unto them, with all the
circumstances which I believed was necessary to tell them, to the end they
might the better understand the importance of the affair: I let them know the
extreme affection which Soliman bare me; the menaces he used against them in
consideration of me; the promises I had received from him if I did that which
he desired; at last I exposed the matter sincerely unto them just as it had
past, and without disguising my sense I gave them to understand, that provided
they might be in safety, I should be glad they would find that I could not
satisfy Soliman but with the loss of my life. They began a dispute then, which
lasted a good while; they would not trust to their memories, but would look
over their books, and not judge tumultuously of the affair. The opinions were
divided for an hour and more, and either side seemed to have very strong
reasons to maintain their party; but in the end the Patriarch told them, that
as amongst us we daily see religious men sent forth in the habit of Merchants,
or Cavaliers, for the converting of souls, so the same disguisement might be
permitted to one, provided it were for the same cause, and that the sole
interest of Christendom carried me to this deceit, which certainly would bring
me to happiness in heaven, and to glory on earth, if I could resolve to execute
it generously; that the power which I had over the spirit of Soliman, might
peradventure be so great, as to make him doubt of his Religion; that it may be
his conversion might be reserved for me; and that if this should happen, it
would render the greatest service to Christendom that ever was rendered unto it;
that thereon peradventure depended the safety of an hundred thousand persons;
and that in conclusion his advice was, that I could not fail in this occasion.
This opinion being become general amongst them, they conjured me to submit my
sense to theirs, in satisfying Soliman, and that they would engage their
consciences to me, that mine should be discharged of all fault in this
encounter, so as I let not my self be blinded with greatness, and that the
protection of Christendom were the only motive that carried me to this
disguisement. I did what I could to oblige them to change their advice; I made
an hundred objections, and an hundred demands to them; I told them, that
although I should not bear arms against Christendom, as I was fully resolved
not to do, yet I should not always forbear hurting it, if I served in other
occasions, because I should still be augmenting the Turkish Empire. But they
told me, so as I carried the war to the Persians, it would amuse Soliman
unprofitably for himself, and profitably for the Christians; for that the
conquests which the Turks made upon the Persians, could never, through a kind
of extraordinary fate, be conserved by them; that in this sort occupying
Soliman in that war, it would deprive him of the means of turning his Arms
against Christendom; that of two evils the least was always to be chosen; and
finally, that I should in my person answer for the miseries which should arrive
unto them, if I did not yield a blind obedience to what they ordained, whenas I
sufficiently knew that reason would have it to be so. I was forced then to
follow their directions, and to go unto Soliman, after I had been instructed by
them concerning all that I was to do. As for that Prince, when he had
propounded the matter to the Muphti in such terms as testified that he desired
it, he that made no other use of the Religion whereof he was the Head, but his
own profit, failed not to tell the Sultan, out of the hope of a recompense,
that the thing was not only permitted, but was also meritorious, seeing it
conduced to the service of the Empire, which the Prophet had established. As
soon as the Sultan saw me, he came to me, and beholding me with a fixed eye, he
sought to know the thoughts of my heart by the motions of my face; but not
giving him leave to speak to me, I assured him that I came to obey him,
provided that his Higness would accord me three things which I desired of him.
I had no sooner said thus, but that without knowing what I would have, this
Prince assured me that they were granted unto me; I besought him then to hear
me first, to the end that precipitating nothing I might never give him occasion
to complain of me. After he had given me the liberty to say what I would to
him, I humbly requested him not to take it ill, that being his Slave I should
be so bold as to capitulate with him, and give bounds to his Authority; for, my
Lord, said I unto him I do not consent unto this disguisement, which thy
Highness desires of me, but upon condition that thou shall never speak to me to
put that in effect, which I am going to do in show; that thou will permit me to
have always about me in the habit of a Slave, a Priest of my Religion, whom I
will procure to come from one of the Islands of the Archi-pelago; and that which
is the most important, that thou shall never command me to bear Arms against
Christendom: If any of thy Subjects, said I to him further, shall rebel, as
Zellebis; if thou will conquer Persia; if any other of thy Neighbors that is
not Christian, shall oblige thee to make war upon him, or if thou will render
thy self Master of all the rest of the Orient, hold me for the basest of thy
Slaves if I spare either my blood, or my life, for the glory of thy Arms. If
thy goodness does not refuse me this which I beg of thee on my knees, dispose
of me as thou please, I am resolved to follow thy directions exactly, and to
obey thee in all things. Soliman was so contented with the obtaining of that
which he desired, as he swore unto me above an hundred times, that the th^ee
things which I had demanded, should be inviolably observed. But not to lose
time, said he unto me, I will have thy change published presently, to the end
the people may not be surprised with it; in the mean space I will go and give
order for the Muphti to come to me, and will command him to repair to thee
eight days one after another, to make the world think that he instructs thee,
and prepares thee for this Ceremony, which shall oblige thee to keep thy
chamber the whilst, the better to make it be believed that it will be
performed. At length, Madam, not to prolong this discourse with vain
repetitions, the business was done as it had been propounded, and this dumb
show was so well carried, as no body believed it but to be so. As long as I
kept the house I was visited by the chiefest of the Empire, who judged rightly,
that the affection of Soliman having no other obstacle to hinder him from
employing me, would without doubt bring me into an estate able to serve them,
as indeed it was not long before I perceived that their conjectures were true;
for the second day after this imposture, I found, that I had an house, a
magnificent train, rich clothes, and to conclude an equipage proportionable to
the employment which Soliman gave me, by making me General of the Army in the
place of the Bassa Sinan: And to testify his amity the better unto me, he gave
me wherewith to render secretly to the Patriarch of Constantinople, and the
rest that had counseled me, the Tribute which he had drawn from them the last
three years, and caused also the foundation of a Palace to be laid, which
afterward I finished. In the mean time he had taken care, that I should have
troops ready to march, when I had satisfied the civilities of the Ceremony, so
that at such time as I went first to salute him in a Turkish habit, I found
that that, which I believed should have been one of my ordinary visits, was a
farewell for me to go and command the Army of Natolia. I will not tell you,
Madam, the joy which this Prince showed in this occasion, it was so great, as
my tongue has not an expression powerful enough to paint it forth unto you;
but in the end to let you see in what estate I was with him, I have but to tell
you, that after he had fully instructed me about the affairs of Natolia, and
that he had commanded me to take upon me the Conduct of his Army, he told me,
that to do me justice, and to punish the Bassa Sinan both for the cruelty he
had before times used toward me, and for the cowardice he had showed, his
pleasure was, that yielding me his place, he should withal take that in my
service which I had held in his, namely, Madam, that he should be my slave as I
had been his. I must confess here, that without playing the generoso this
proposition grieved me very much, and notwithstanding all the respect I had to
Soliman, as soon as he acquainted me with his intention I cast my self at his
feet, humbly to beseech him not to command me the doing of so extraordinary a
thing, nor to require, that a man who had been my Master, should be reduced to
misery and infamy; that for my part, I could never resolve to put him in chains
that had commanded me, and who, it may be, was more unfortunate than faulty: I
represented then unto him that the fate of war does oftentimes mock at humane
prudence; that force and number do not always suffice to have the better; and
lastly, that victory does not always attend upon valor and justice. After all
these reasons, which peradventure had not been potent enough to move him, I
begged the liberty and fortune of this man for a recompense of all the services
which I would render him, and besought him to be contented with absenting him
from the Port, by sending him to be Governor of some one of his Provinces.
Soliman resisted my request at first, but afterward consented thereunto, upon
condition that the Bassa should know how much he was obliged unto me; then he
gave me a Letter for him, whereby he was commanded to remit the remainder of
his Army into my hands, and straightly embracing me, Go, said he unto me, my
dear Ibrahim, whither thy glory calls thee, where mine requires thee, and where
victory attends thee: But when thou shall be accumulated with honor, when thou
shall have re-established that of my Arms, and triumphed over mine enemies,
come and receive the recompense that I shall prepare for thee, and quietly
enjoy the fruit of thy labors. Justiniano having observed some change in
Isabellaes face, thought it was fit for him to say, I perceive, Madam, that
this name of Ibrahim does surprise and astonish you, but your astonishment will
cease, when I shall have told you, that in changing of habit I did not change
my name, and that this which I bear is the same with that of Ibrahim amongst
the Turks. It is true, answered the Princess, that I was strangely surprised by
this name, but it is true also, that my astonishment is not yet finished; for
could it be possible that you should be that Ibrahim of whom the relations of
the Levant has told us such wonders? whose valor has done such miracles, who
has conquered a part of Persia, gained so many great battails, caused Soliman
to be crowned at Bagdet, and who passes for so extraordinary a man, as it is
not believed the Orient has ever had the like? Now, I pray you, hold me no
longer in suspense, but after you have cleared that unto me which I ask of you,
pursue the sequel of your History, and acquaint me exactly with all that has
befallen you. I know very well, Madam, replied Justiniano, that after that
which you have said, I should, if I were modest, disavow my self, but being
true and sincere I must confess, that I am that Ibrahim whom fame has so much
flattered, as I cannot tell how to know my self by the pourtrait which your
Excellency has made of me by her report: Rely not then upon that which this
deceiver has told you, and to make you the Judge thereof do but give ear to
the process of my adventures. As soon as I was arrived at Natolia with the
Troops which the Grand Signior had given me to conduct thither, I went directly
to Chientaia, from whence the Bassa Sinan had not stirred since his retiring to
it, having done no^^ing else but encamped the remainder of his Army near to the
Town, in atten^ing either Forces, or a new Order; I sent him that which I had
brought, by a C^pigi, which he executed very punctually; he consigned the Army
into my hands, and gave me thanks for the obligations wherein he stood engaged
unto me; for he had understood by the Sultans Letter, that I had saved him from
an extreme ill fortune. I comforted him the best I could, and promised him,
that if the Emperor continued his favor to me, I would continue also to serve
him. After this I employed all my care to carry my self in such sort, that the
hopes which Soliman had of me might not be frustrated. I caused my Army to be
mustered, and having put it into Battle Array, I went from rank to rank to
visit all the Troops, and encouraging them to do well, (for I had learnt the
language of the Country perfe^tly) I assured them, that in leading them to the
fight, I would be the first that would be engaged therein; that I would perform
the part of the soldier, as well as of the General of the Army; that I would
reserve my self nothing of all the booty which should be gotten from the enemy,
but the sole pleasure of having enriched them. After this discourse, they made
shouts of joy, which persuaded me that I was agreeable to them. Then came all
the Commanders to take the Oath of Obedience to me, and to assure me that they
would follow me to the death: That done, I marched directly to the enemy, who
was not above fifteen or twenty miles from us; but whereas he had been
advertised that the Slave which had taken Chientaia, was General of the Army
that was coming to attaque him, the remembrance of what had past made him to
fear that which was to ensue, and for that reason he discamped in have, with a
purpose to retire to a side of Natolia, where it had been impossible to have
forced him to fight. When I perceived his design by the way his Army took, I
resolved to prevent him, by causing my forces to march a whole night with all
possible speed: The matter succeeded so happily, that my Army having had
leisure to rest three or four hours, began to see that of Zellebis appear, who
being soon advertised of this warlike stratagem, entered into such despair for
having been surprised in this sort, as he resolved to accept of the Battle
which I presented unto him. I was glad to understand his design, and to inspire
my Soldiers with the same thought, I assured them, after I had given order for
all things, that the justice of the cause we defended was a presage of the
victory; that it was easier to punish Rebels, who carried a domestique enemy in
their hearts, which reproached them with their crime, than to vanquish men
whose Arms were lawful; that they whom we were to fight with, being resolved
for it more by fear and necessity, than by valor, it would be but too easy
for our glory to remain victorious: I represented also unto them, that the
travail they had endured in going so fast, was not disadvantageous unto them,
it being most certain, that they which fly are wearied more than they which
pursue them; that the end of the War depending on this battle, I was resolved
to vanquish or to dye; and that all the favor I demanded of them was, to
follow the way which I was going to show them. I had no sooner done speaking,
but they testified unto me, both by their shouts and by their actions, their
desire to fight; so that not suffering so noble a heat to cool, I marched on
foremost to the Enemy. I will not stand, Madam, to particularize this battle,
since it would be to abuse your patience, and be wanting in good manners, to
entertain you so long with matters of war; it shall suffice then to tell you
that which regards me directly, seeing you will have it so, although it be not
without blushing. Wherefore I shall only say, Madam, that at first the enemies
received us courageously, and that they repulsed us several times with such
ardour, as despair did more in them than valor in us; but after that the
victory had hung ballancing on either side, and that the hope of carrying it
had possessed each party more than once, it was my good fortune, maugre the
confusion of the fight, to know Zellebis by the m^rks which had been given me
of him. He was of a reasonable extraordinary bigness, and his custom was to
carry always two Scymitars in the wars, the one in his hand, and the other at
his saddle-bow; he was also many times armed after the Persian manner, so as no
way doubting but that it was he, I brake through the press to meet him, and
calling him by his name, I told him, that the same Slave, who before had
vanquished him in his chains, was come to make him satisfaction for that
outrage in Arms; I spoke to him in this sort, because I had understood that in
a speech to his soldiers, after he had heard that I was General of the Army,
he had told them in a jeering way, that I was still so tired with wearing of
irons, as it would be easy for him to overcome me: Howbeit fortune disposed of
it otherwise, not because he was not a more valiant man than I, but because I
was more fortunate than he. As soon as he understood that which I have told
you, he seconded my design; and that we might the better enter into a
particular fight we freed our selves, as well as we could, from those that
environed us, and being separated from the rest, we began our combat. I doubt
not, Madam, but you will be astonished with that which I am going to acquaint
you with, since it is certain, that one will have much ado not to be surprised
with a thing which has no example in all Antiquity, and which your imagination
would not foresee. It happened then, Madam, that some of ours having observed
this action, and having told it to their companions, this rumor spread it self
so suddenly amongst the two Armies, that as if those two great bodies had had
but one spirit, which had animated them, they took both of them the same
resolution, and confided so in the valor of their Chieftains, as they
determined to be spectators of the victory, which they attended from them. They
of my party said, that they would not share the glory of this day with me, and
that I would carry it away well enough without their succor; and others
muttered, that he who had known so well how to begin the war, knew also how to
finish it gloriously. At length, Madam, the most earnest to fight, separated
themselves to behold us; and as if there had been some enchantment in this
adventure, every one retired to his own Ensign, and in an instant the field of
our combat proved to be in the midst of two Armies in Battle Array. This event
surprised me in such sort, as it had like to have cost me my life; for whereas,
maugre the heat of the fight, I had conserved so much coldness and judgment,
as to mark what was done, and to be astonished at it, going to turn about my
head toward my soldiers to give them assurance that I fought for them, I
furnished mine enemy with such an opportunity, as being loath to lose that
advantage, he struck me so great a blow with his Scymitar upon my Turbant, as I
was almost bereft of my senses, and if by good hap it had not turned in his
hand, I had certainly been lost: Hereupon arose cries from both parties, which
amidst their confusion testified their thoughts unto us; and whereas mine had
observed, that I had received this blow by looking at them, they would have
advanced, which I perceiving by the enemies countenance, I separated my self
some dozen or fourteen paces from Zellebis to charge them not to stir, and to
confirm them in that design I returned to Zellebis with such courage, as they
were persuaded it would not be easy for him to surmount me. Howbeit we
disputed this victory a long time, and verily this man combated with such
heart, as gave me a great desire to save him; so that his horse having thrown
him to the ground upon a blow that I unwittingly gave him, I told him that if
he would render himself I would promise to get his pardon of Soliman; but being
got up again with fury, and having answered me, that he would have the victory,
or die, I would not combat him with advantage, so that being alighted from my
horse we began a new fight, which was more unfortunate for him than the former:
For feelling my self hurt in the left arm, the desire which I had to vanquish
redoubled in such manner, as in a little time his death put fear in^o his Army,
and joy into mine. Some of his seeing him fall would have advanced to revenge
his loss, or to recover his body, but they were so rudly repulsed, as they were
constrained to change that design into that of breaking and flying: I then
commanded my men to cry out in pursuing them, that they should be received to
grace which would render themselves; this voice failed not to work its effect,
for out of the despair wherein they were, for having lost not only the General
of their Army, but the Author of all this war, many of them flung down their
Arms; the rest were cut in pieces, some excepted that retired into the revolted
Towns; but I can say, that they which escaped the pursuit of our Forces
contributed not the least to our glory, for they brought so great a terror to
the places which they had chosen for their retreat, as in fifteen days they
rendered all to the obedience of the Grand Signior. In the mean time to make
good my word, and to follow the custom of those Countries, I sent the head of
Zellebis to Soliman, who doubtless was not so glad at the death of his enemy
for the interest he had in it, as he was because he believed that this action
was glorious to me: And whereas he had an extreme desire to see me, I had order
to return unto Constantinople as soon as Natolia should be peaceable, and that
I had secured all the revolted places. I was not long before I was in an estate
to obey him, for whereas Zellebis was the only man that remained of the Race
of Chaz-hassen, so considerable with the Calenders, and the Deruis, there was
no one found amongst them whom the rest would obey; the equality of their
birth and condition was the cause that never a one in particular would endure
that another should command, and this dissension put them into such disorder,
as they were more revolted amongst themselves, than against their Sovereign. I
profited by the advertisement I received hereof, for Soliman having sent me an
absolute power to pardon, or to punish, I commanded them to yield, promising to
make their peace with the Grand Signior, but threatening that if they did not
accept of the pardon which I offered them, to extirpate them utterly, and to
cause all the Deruis, and all the Calenders to be banished from out of the
whole extent of the Turkish Empire. This was done in a conjuncture so
favorable, that they all with one voice resolved to render themselves; there
was not a Town which did not open their Gates, receive a Governor from my hand,
and a Garrison strong enough to keep them from rebelling another time; and for
more surety, I caused all the Deruis and Calenders to be disarmed, representing
unto them, that the profession of men of Religion did not permit them to have
Arms; and that their crime could not receive a lighter punishment, than to be
contented that the means of their future offending should be taken from them.
At length, Madam, after I had set an order to all things, I returned to
Constantinople, where for a recompense of that little I had done, Soliman made
me Bassa, and Grand Vizier, which is the prime Charge of that Empire; for it
had so fallen out, that he who possessed it died in my absence. I did all that
I could to refuse this honor, but in the end I was constrained to accept of it,
both by the Commandment of the Grand Signior, and by the counsel of the
Religious men of Pera, and of the Patriarch of the Greek Church, whom I still
acquainted with all that befell me, by a Priest disguised like a slave, which
always attended on me, alleging this reason to me for it, that the more power
I had, the more utile I should be for Christendom. Behold me then the first
^erson of the Empire next to Soliman, but with an Authority so absolute, as
never was there Subject seen so independent from his Sovereign. I was some time
instructing my self in the Forms and Ceremonies that are to be observed in
dispatches; after which Soliman reposed himself on me for the Government of his
Estates, except it were for so much as concerned the affairs of Christendom,
which I always protected as much as possibly I could. In the mean season this
Prince thought many times on Felixana, extremely marvelling at the long voyage
of Rustan, upon whose coming he had placed a great deal of hope; but fortune
that often delights in extraordinary things, and loves to give weak
beginnings to the most important affairs, had disposed of it in a fashion which
Soliman did not foresee: And how prudent soever he was, he did not consider,
that Love and Fortune, who were to give success to this adventure, were two
Deities too blind to bestow all that he desired on him, although he deserved
it; and indeed he was deceived by them both, for he was amazed to see Rustan
return very melancholic, without Slaves, without Soldiers, without a
Vessel, and without Felixana. At first he believed that his design having
been discovered all his equipage had been taken from him, and that he had been
ill entreated; but when he had commanded him to give him an account of his
voyage, he learned, that the business had past in another manner; for Rustan
had been so dextrous, and so happy in his enterprise, as he had forcibly
carried away the person whom the picture which Soliman had given him
represented: But, Madam, this person was not Felixana, and this adventure is so
deplorable, that although it be not intermingled with my fortune, but only in
regard it is the foundation of a war, which I am obliged to relate, yet would I
let you understand it, seeing you will be acquainted with the whole course of
my life, did I not fear to importune you with so long a Narration. The Princess
interrupting Justiniano, desired him not to speak to her any more in this sort,
and to tell her, not only all that which had befallen him, but all that which
he knew concerning the life of Soliman; it seeming unto her, that this Princess
loved him too well not to have his History joined to his; whereupon Justiniano
began thus.

The History of the Princess Axiamira.
AS soon as Rustan, after he had quitted his Vessel in Mingrelia, and had
taken another upon the River of Araxes, was arrived with his soldiers
disguised at Mazanderon, which is a Town situated on the bank of the Caspian
Sea, and the Capital of Hircania, at this day called Diargument, and had cast
anchor in the Port, he understood that the Princess Axiamira had been there a
pretty while, although it was not as yet the season wherein she used to come
thither; but forsome disorder which had happened in the Sophies Court she had
advanced her voyage. Rustan, seeing such a wonderful good hap for the
commencement of his enterprise, thought of nothing else but to seek the means
how he might be introduced into the Castle, for the which he began to fall in
with the Merchants of the place, and to part with some things that he had
brought thither, at a price much below the ordinary, to the end his design
might succeed the rather; as indeed he had not been eight days in the Town,
but he received order to let the Princess Axiamira see the goodliest things he
had; he obeyed this commandment with joy, being in good hope that Felixana was
with her: He carried her then a great many Mirrors, little Pictures, and
curious Watches, which are the rarest things amongst the Persians; but he was
exceedingly surprised and astonished whenas waiting in Axiamiraes chamber for
her coming out of her Cabinet, he heard one call a maid, that had brought him
in, Felixana, who, though she was very fair, resembled not a whit the pourtrait
which he had: this amazement doubtless was great enough, but it redoubled more
whenas the Princess Axiamira entered into the chamber, and that he certainly
knew she was the Original of that fatal Picture, which has since caused the
shedding of so much blood, and so many tears. He was so struken with this
sight, that at first it gave the Princess occasion to think, that being a
Merchant, and not accustomed to converse with great persons, he was out of
countenance; howbeit at length he told her in the Persian tongue, that within a
little while he should have rarer things yet to show her, hoping by this
artifice to have the opportunity to see the Princess once again, the better to
confirm him in the belief that what he beheld was true. Axiamira, giving credit
to his words, bought only a Looking-glass, and some Watches, and then ordained
him not to fail in letting her have a sight of those rarities he spoke of, as
soon as they were come to his hands. Rustan retired in this sort, but so full
of confusion and astonishment, as he was a long time before he could believe
that which he had seen, and longer yet before he could resolve upon what to do
in so unexpected an event. What! said he to himself, as he told me after his
return, is it possible that Felixana should be turned into Aximira? that the
daughter of the Governor of Mazanderon should become the daughter of the Sophy
of Persia? or that through an extraordinary adventure a Merchant should be so
daring as to assure a thing to Soliman, whereof he was not well assured
himself? Hereupon having opened the case wherein the Picture was, which the
Grand Signior had given him, and also recollecting his imagination and his
memory, for the comparing of it with the original, and for the observing of
all the lineaments in particular, his eyes so confirmed him in the belief, that
it was the Picture of Axiamira, as he made no longer doubt of it. Then it was,
that he saw himself combated with diverse thoughts; for whereas he is ambitious,
hardy, cunning, and wicked, and that to attain to a glorious employment, would
undertake any thing; the fear of displeasing Soliman either in venturing to
tarry Axiamira forcibly away, or in returning without doing ought, agitated him
so mightily, as he was ten or twelve days sick upon it, during which time he
did nothing but pass up and down in his mind all the reasons that might induce
him, either to the forcible carrying away of Axiamira, or to the restraining
him from it: On the one side he thought, that the Grand Signior having made
choice of him for the service of his amorous passion, he should be but badly
received, if at his return he only brought back for the fruit of his voyage,
that Felixana resembled not the picture which had been given him; He feared
also that Solimans hope being frustrated, that which he had of being Beglerbei
of Syria would be so too; Wherefore regarding the matter after another sort, he
labored to find another satisfaction in his own. But the more he considered
the design of carrying away of Axiamira by force, the more obstacles he found
therein; he was not powerful enough to force the Town or Castle, and the
retiredness wherein the women live over all the Orient, permitted him not the
means to work upon any of those that were near the Princess for the suborning
them: But above all things, the sole apprehension that Soliman should not
approve of his design, and should be offended to understand, that instead of
forcibly carrying away the daughter of a simple Governor, he should have
forcibly carried away that of one of the mightiest Princes of the world, put
him into an unquietness that cannot be expressed; and I verily believe by that
which I could conjecture out of his own relation, that this last fear had
absolutely mastered his soul, and carried him to return without enterprizing
further, had not the misfortune of the unhappy Axiamira made him change his
opinion, and brought her to contribute her self to her own ruin, without
thinking of it. This excellent Princess took so much pleasure in fishing, and
was so delighted with this sport, as there were few fair days which she
employed not in this maritime chase; and whereas all Persia was quiet, having
no war either domestic or foreign, she went to this innocent warfare, more
accompanied with fishermen than soldiers, and almost without other arms than
nets and hooks. During the time that Rustans sickness lasted, he observed that
Axiamira was two or three days a fishing, and having dexterously informed
himself from some Merchants who dealt with him, that the Princess used
oftentimes so to do, he understood wha^ I have declared, so that no longer
judging this design, which he had believed to be impossible, other than a
little hazardous, and having a Vessel that was an excellent Sayler, well
furnished with all things, and never a Mariner but which was a Soldier, he
looked on this affair after another manner, and out of an extreme inhumanity he
reasoned in this sort. I have order from Soliman, said he, to put him in
possession of the Original of this Picture; it is not the name of Felixana
that makes him amorous, it is the beauty of Axiamira which he has seen in this
pourtrait; it is then Axiamira whom I am forcibly to carry away: It is true,
that she is a Princess, but it is also true, that therein fortune favors me, in
giving me the means to acquire a treasure for Soliman far more precious than he
believed it to be; the boldness of my enterprise will make the greatness of my
recompense, and will manifest to his Highness, that there is nothing which I
would not do to obey him. Behold, Madam, the unjust reasons wherewith Rustan
authorized his enterprise, but the true were, as I have already said, that he
has naughty inclinations; that he is born for crime and violence; and that he
is so much an enemy to goodness, as it suffices to be virtuous for to be hated
of him. He took the resolution then to carry away Axiamira by force, at such
time as she should go a fishing; but to faciliate his design he judged it fit
to get him out of the Port, and to the end they should not marvail at his
departure, he to obtain permission for it caused the Princess to be told, that
having received advertisement how a vessel of his Country was within three or
four days to be at a Port that was not above ten miles from Mazanderon, he was
resolved to go and wait for it there, to deal for some commodities which he
thought he had had, but had forgot to bring along with him, that at his return
he would not fail to let her see the rarities, whereof he had spoken, not
being able to do it sooner by reason of his sickness: And to show that he
intended to return again, he suffered himself to be unpayd by some Merchants
that were in his debt. He parted then in this manner, leaving the Princess very
desirous of his return, in regard of her inclinations to such rare things; but
whereas he had no design to eloign himself much, and had observed how the
Princess used ordinarily to take that way whereby he came thither, he put his
vessel into the covert of a Creek three miles from the Port, where the point
of a Rock advanced so far into the sea, as they that came from the Towns side
could not see them which were there, before they were so near as they could not
decline a fight. It was here where Rustan resolved to attend the Princess,
being confident that she would not be long before she came thither, because he
knevv it was the place most proper for her sport: In the mean time to beguile
the vessels, which passing by might discover him, he set up the Flag of Persia
in his Main-top, and caused all his men that appeared on the deck to change
their habit; for the cunning of this man had provided for all things, and had
not omitted ought that could conduce to the happy success of so mischievous a
design. Now accordingly this deplorable Princess, no way doubting of the
treason that was intended against her, resolved the next day after Rustans
departure, to recreate her self on the sea; but to make up her misfortune, she
would not that day go a fishing, but only take the air, and pass away the time
more freely with her women. In the mean season Rustan had made a speech to his
soldiers and Mariners, whom he had gained with gifts, to encourage them to
well-doing, if it happened that he should command them to attacque a vessel. He
told them, that what he desired of them was the least exploit he could expect
from their valor, since it was a vessel without Ordnance, and more laden with
women than soldiers; that above all things they should beware of doing any
outrage to the Ladies; but for the men, that they should not spare them, it
being necessary that none should escape which might testify ought concerning
this Action. After this he set a sentinel on the top of the Rock to discover
when Axiamiraes vessel should come out of the Port, for to advertise him of
it. The impatience of this Ravisher lasted not long; for, as I have already
declared, the next day after his departure, the Princess resolved to go and
take the air: no sooner was she on the sea, but the sentinel advertised Rustan
of it, who with all speed fitted his ship, and prepared his men to do that
which he had commanded them. Scarcely had he given order for every thing,
whenas the Princesses vessel appeared; she was sitting in the Stern upon
Cushions of cloth of Gold, with all her women about her, and attired like an
Amazon, as her picture represented her, having a Dart in her right hand, upon
which she leaned: As soon as she perceived Rustans vessel, she rose up
suddenly to observe it, as if she had foreseen what was to arrive unto her;
this first apprehension was quickly seconded by another more grievous one; for
just as the Princess rose up, Rustan changed the design he had of following
her, that so he might draw her the further from the Town, into that of setting
upon her immediately, so that he commanded his men to make up with full fails
to the vessel, and board her, expressly forbidding any Ordnance to be shot off,
for fear of losing that which he meant to preserve, and that the Castle too
might not thereby take up an Alarm, and come to the succor of the Princess.
This was not so soon said as executed; Axiamiraes vessel was boorded by that
of Rustan, who first of all leaped into her, for to save the Princess from
peril, and to encourage his men, which seconded him so happily, as the
resistance of Axiamiraes Guard was in vain; the surprise and astonishment
wherewith they were seized, served not a little to make them be so easily
vanquished; for in a quarter of an hours fight they were all slain, Rustan not
having above three of his people hurt. But when he would have had the Princess
remove out of her vessel into his, she showed more heart than her soldiers had
done, and encouraging her women to defend themselves, and to endure rather to
be killed, than to let themselves to be carried away, she advanced toward him
with the Dart in her hand, and whatsoever he could do to restrain her, being
loath to use her unworthily in her misfortune, he could not keep her from
hurting him in the face: But whereas he saw that his respect might be the cause
of his undoing, in retaining him too long in so dangerous a place, he commanded
four of his soldiers to quit their weapons, and take her up in their Arms, and
carry her into his vessel. Then it was when she redoubled her uttermost
endeavor, and that with incredible courage, she would have rid her self out of
their hands to have leapt into the sea; but Rustan took so much care to
preserve her, as he hindered her from it. As soon as her women savv that their
resistance was vain, and that the Princess was in Rustans vessel, they left
desending themselves, and out of an affection which cannot be sufficiently
admired, they strove who should first pass into their enemies vessel, so much
did they fear to abandon their Mistress, choosing much rather to be slaves with
her, than to remain free without her. After this Rustan held it necessary to
sink the Princesses vessel, which was instantly done, but he thought it was
not fit to cast the dead bodies into the sea, for fear lest some of them being
driven a shore by the waves should be a sign that the Princess had not suffered
shipwreck, as he desired it should be believed, in regard they would be all
found full of wounds. He caused all the dead bodies then to be carried into his
vessel, with an intention when they should be further off, to throw them
over-boord in sacks half filled with some heavy things, which afterward was
accordingly executed. When they had sunk the Princesses vessel, he commanded
his Pilot to steer toward Mingrelia, and to employ all his skill in making
thither with all the possible speed he could; he gave order also to his
soldiers to keep themselves continually ready to fight, and unto two of his
men carefully to watch for the discovery of whatsoever should appear at sea,
and presently to advertise him of it. This done, he went to the Princess, whom
they had put into the Captains Cabin, but he was much amazed to find her in a
swoon; her striving, and the grief she was in to see her self so carried away,
had so weakened, and oppressed her, as she was without pulse, without motion,
and almost without life. The resentment which Rustan showed for it, and the
care he took to assist her, though it was rather the effect of his interest
than of his pity, caused the Princesses women to have some comfort amidst
their misfortune: They labored all of them together then to make her come to
her self again; and a little after she assured them by a deep sigh, that she
would soon be sensible of all her miseries; and accordingly within a while she
opened her eyes; but not being longer able to make any resistance, and seeing
Rustan by her, whom she knew, though she had never beheld him but once before,
and that he had changed his habit, she was constrained to have recourse unto
her tears. Rustan seeing her in this estate, fell on his knees before her to
ask her pardon for the wrong he did her, and to beseech her to believe, that so
sad a beginning would have a most happy end. He told her likewise, that he was
not what she thought him to be; that he operated by a more powerful hand than
his own; and that if her grief would permit her to give ear unto that, which
might comfort her, she would quickly dry up her tears. This Princess striving
to answer him, said unto him with a low voice, that there was no way to
comfort her, but to assure her, that she should die without the deprivation of
her honor and liberty, and without falling into the hands of Deliment. Rustan
swor^ unto her then, that he knew not that Deliment of whom she spoke, and
protested, that far from doing her any violence, he would serve her with all
respect, beseeching her once again to suspend her grief until she had learnt
the cause of her misfortune. This cheater spoke this with a face wherein
compassion and sincerity were so well painted forth, as solicited again by her
women, she resolved to hear him: But he first desired that she would give them
order to withdraw a little aside, to the end that none but she might understand
what he said unto her. She made some difficulty to agree thereunto, but at
length she was forced to obey. He recounted to her then, how her unhappiness
was an effect of her beauty; but he did not tell her, that Soliman had loved
her under the name of Felixana, only he acquainted her that her picture had
begot this love, and consequently the design which he had executed; howbeit he
perceived that Axiamira did not believe him, so that to persuade her the
better, he showed her picture to her, which she presently knew, and calling her
women to her to look upon it, she put them in mind, how the Sophy having caused
her to be drawn one day with Felixana by an excellent Painter, whom fortune had
brought into their country, he had commanded many coppies to be made of them,
which he had given to Merchants for the publishing of her beauty all abroad,
and that of Felixana whom he infinitely loved. Upon this discourse Rustan was
no longer troubled to conceive, how Axiamira had been taken for Felixana,
easily imagining that a Merchant, who it may be understood not the Persian
tongue very well, might be deceived in taking the picture of Felixana for that
of Axiamira, and that of Axiamira for that of Felixana, and much the rather,
for that the Merchant had got those pictures without ever seeing the Princess,
as we came to know afterward. But to return to this afflicted fair one, after
that Rustan had acquainted her with the cause of her misfortune, he would have
enlarged himself upon the magnificences of the Seraglio, upon the excellent
qualities of Soliman, upon the excess of the passion which he was in for her,
and have persuaded her that her unhappiness would make her happy. But this
generous Princess, not able to endure a discourse so far distant from her
sense, said unto him with a voice much stronger, than the weakness wherein she
was would seem to permit her; do you believe then, that a person which might
have succeeded to the Crown of Persia, can resolve to be the slave of Soliman?
to spend her life in prison? and to have for her companions infamous creatures,
who are for the most part the refuse of Pirates? No, no, Axiamira came not into
the world but to reign, and her death shall make it soon appear, that she knows
not how to obey: Fortune has put me into your hands, but mine shall deliver me
out of them. After this she mused a pretty while very profoundly, Rustan not
daring to answer her for fear of further incensing her; then suddenly speaking
again, and addressing her self to him, Can I hope, said she unto him, for any
sincerity in a man that has so cruelly betrayed me? and can I believe that
what he has told me is true? for how can it be imagined that Soliman, whose
reputation is so great and so fair, should be capable of causing an innocent
Princess to be forcibly carried away for to make her his slave? and how can it
yet be conceived, that this Prince, who is said to be so amorous of a certain
Roxelana, and who has loved her so long, could be in a passion for a picture,
yea in such a passion as has obliged him to violate the law of Nations, to
forget natural equity, to outrage a Prince as mighty as himself, and to do an
act so strange as it is without example in all Ages? Tell me then, I conjure
you, said she unto him, the true cause of my disaster, and hide not from me
that which time will clear unto me but too well. Rustan seeing her mind a
little quieter in all appearance, thought he might gain her by gentleness;
wherefore he assured her with all the artifice that possibly he could use; how
all that which he had told her was true, but how it was true also, that the
image of the Seraglio, which seemed so dreadful unto her, was a mere effect of
her grief; that all the grace he would demand of her was no other, but that she
would live until she had seen Soliman, which favor if he might obtain of her,
he was well assured, that the sight of so excellent a Prince would make her
change her opinion. Yes, said she, interrupting him, I will live, if my grief
will permit it; but I will live only to seek out the means how to revenge the
death, that I will give my self, as soon as my complaints and cries have made
some one to know the outrage which I have received, to the end that the report
thereof being bruited abroad, the Sophy my Father may, by learning the cause of
my loss, take such revenge for it, as Heaven does promise me, and which also I
beg of it: Behold then what I accord to your desires, in the mean time, if
pity may yet find any place in your soul, leave me to weep with my women, and
refuse me not the grace that I may be permitted to bewail them for the miseries
which I have brought them to, and to prepare them for my death; but if your
inhumanity does carry you not to grant me this that I desire, as methinks I
observe in your countenance, remember that birth not depending on fortune, I am
still the daughter of the Sophy of Persia, and that you are but a Slave, who
doubtless have nothing more recommendable in you, than fraud and cunning
wherewith to serve the violences of your Master; get you out of this Chamber
then, and enter no more unto it, till the hour of my death be come; for surely
the rank which I hold does ordain you to have so much respect unto me, who
commands you unto it. Rustan, who had no other interest in the carrying away of
this Princess, but that of conducting her to Soliman, fearing nothing more than
to see her die before she should arrive at Constantinople, was afraid in
hearing her speak so imperiously, that she would have fallen into some extreme
resolution, if he should have contradicted her, wherefore he went out of her
chamber, and assured her, that she should see by his respect, that he had not
forgotten what he owed unto her: But first he took heed with a great deal of
care, not to leave any thing wherewith she might hurt her self, which the
perceiving said further unto him, You may take from me iron, fire and poison,
but not the will to die, and by it I shall always find means to execute my
design: Rustan would return her no answer, knowing full well that she was not
in an estate to be persuaded. After this he caused her to be served very
carefully without ever entering into her chamber, yet did he for the most part
hear all that she said to her women; for fearing lest she should offer to get
out of the Cabin for to go and cast her self into the Sea, he lay always at
the Cabbin-door, not daring to trust any body with the guard of a treasure from
whence he hoped for all his fortune. I will not recount unto you the generous
and pitiful discourses of this unfortunate Princess during this voyage, since
it would but augment the regret, which you will have for her loss: For, Madam,
after a Navigation prosperous enough; after they had passed over all the
Caspian Sea by gayning the Coast on the left hand; after they had arrived at
the River of Araxes, which disimbokes it self into this Sea; had traversed by
Land thorough the whole Country of Colob^^da, now called Mingrelia, where
Rustan betook him to his former Vessel again, which had stayed still for him
there; had traveled Mare major, or Pontus Enxinus, from one end to another in
its length; after that, I say, they were come to the Bosphorus of Thrace, in a
place where they even touched the shore, there arose so furious a wind, as they
were constrained to take in all their sails. And whereas the Pilot had
advertised Rustan, that he foresaw the coming of a great storm, and that
within an hour at the farthest, he thought that in regard they were not far
from a place where the Skiff might easily land, it would not be amiss to
persuade the Princess to go ashore, seeing they were within Solimans Dominion,
and where they needed not fear to abandon their Vessel. He caused then one of
the Princesses women to be called unto him for to acquaint her with the peril
wherewith they were threatened, that she might propound unto her the avoiding of
it by the means which I have related; this Maid, who out of the fear of death
approved of ^us^ans proposition, did all that she could to get her Mistress to
embrace it: But this courageous Princess said unto her with an admirable
constancy, that she was resolved to attend the succor of Heaven, imagining
indeed, that the storm wherewith she was threatened, could bring no alteration
to her fortune which would not be advantageous to her. During this contestation
the Sea was moved in such sort, as it was out of all probability, had the
Princess consented to what they desired of her, for one to think that she could
be saved in the Skiff; the tempest was so furious, the air so obscured, the
thunder so loud, the lightning amidst the darkness so dreadful, the waves so
high, the winds so terrible, the rain and hail so abundant, and the roaring of
the Sea so horrible, as it was impossible for one to conceive any hope of
escaping from so evident a danger. They were two days beaten in this manner
with the tempest, and tossed up and down with the wind and the waves, without
ceasing in the mean time to use their uttermost endeavor to with-stand it; but
at last they were fain to give way to this violence, and refer their lives to
the conduct of fortune. Already had the Pilot abandoned the Helm, his Compass
stood him in no stead, the Mast was all to shattered, the Sayl-yards torn off,
the Tackle rent in pieces, the Vessel took in water on every side, the
soldiers cried out in despair, the Mariners abandoned themselves to grief, the
Princesses women were all dissolved into tears, Rustan himself had almost lost
his understanding, whenas in the midst of so general a consternation he heard
the Princess cry unto him with a quiet spirit, and with a settled and confident
voice; at length Axiamira shall not be a Slave, she shall dye with glory,
Heaven is armed for her succor, and (if I deceive not my self) her death shall
be the cause of her revenge. Scarcely had she finished these words, whenas an
hideous wave hitting the Vessel with an unexpressable impetuosity, dashed it
with such violence against the point of a Rock, as they suffered shipwreck in
that very place. I will not tell you, Madam, that which Rustan himself could
not tell us, for this misfortune was so sudden, as in an instant he found, that
of all his Vessel he had nothing left him but a plank which floated to his
hand, as he was laboring in the water, and wherewith he saved his life by
sustaining himself upon it; for this man was so fortunate, as without other
industry than strongly fastening himself to this plank, the Sea (which according
to its custom retains nothing of all the rapines that it makes) cast him on the
shore, where he remained almost in a swoon till the tempest was over, which was
not long first; so as it might have been said, that this Princess had served
for an oblation to pacify the fury of the incensed waters; for two hours after
she had suffered shipwreck, the Sun beginning to appear, dissipated the darkness
of the night, and the tempest, and restored calmness and tranquillity to the
Sea. Rustan, being wholly come to himself again, got up to the side of a Rock
to see if he could discover any mark of so sad a wrack, but he could discover
no other thing than some of the Tackle and Planks of his Vessel, which the
waves had brought to Land, so that despairing of any comfort he went to the
habitation that was nearest to the place where he was, and stayed there certain
days to make search, if at least the body of Axiamira might have been found, as
also to meet with some means for him to return to Constantinople: As for the
Princess, all his care in vain, he found indeed some dead Soldiers and
Mariners along the shore, but of her he never could have any tidings, so that
the unhappy Axiamira is doubtless without life, and without sepulture. In the
mean time Rustan thinking of his return, although he were near to a place where
Prince Gianger, the youngest of Solimans sons was residing, yet would he not
demand any assistance from him, for fear he should be obliged to tell him a
thing which was to be concealed; wherefore he had recourse to the Governor of a
small Town that was not above four miles from thence where he had suffered
shipwreck, who furnishing him with all things requisite for his journey, he
returned by Land to Constantinople with so melancholic a countenance, as at
first sight one might easily perceive that his enterprise had not been
prosperous: I was at that time with his Highness, and I have not lost the
remembrance of so doleful a conversation. As soon as Rustan had made an end of
relating to the Grand Signior that which you have heard, he would have excused
himself for having forcibly carried away Axiamira without his order, but
Soliman said unto him with a face wherein grief and choler equally appeared,
Speak no further unto me thou base and infamous ravisher, and know, that if
thou had not married my daughter Chimeria, thy death should have satisfied for
that of Axiamira. Ah poor Princess, said he, how deplorable is thy face! and
how unhappy is mine! Then turning himself toward me, who was present at this
mournful relation, do not reproach me, my dear Ibrahim, said he unto me, for
not giving credit to thy counsel, which I remember but too well for my
content; and the estate wherein I am, punishes me sufficiently for my
imprudence: Can any innocent be found more unfortunate than I? But what say I,
innocent (continued he) I cannot be so of the death of this Princess; it is I
that have delivered her into the hands of Rustan; it is I that have exposed her
to the tempest; and it is I that have been the cause of her loss. Could I be
ignorant that she was not an ordinary person? No, Ibrahim, I could not; I loved
her under the name of Felixana, but I was to adore her in my heart as a great
Princess; I saw something so high and so majesticall in the air of her face, as
I cannot be excusable for not knowing her; for howsoever, if the possession of
Axiamira was necessary for my felicity, she was to be entreated after another
manner; and if my love would have constrained me to have recourse unto
violence, I should have gone in person in the head of an hundred thousand men
to make so noble a conquest with honor; she should have been brought in a
triumphant Chariot, and not in the Vessel of a Traitor and impious man; I
should not have thought of possessing her till I had set a Crown upon her head;
and if I could not have obtained her, I should have changed my love into
respect, and with admiration have looked upon a bliss that was forbidden me:
But Rustan did not believe that I was capable of such noble apprehensions, he
has judged of my mind by his own; he thought because he is violent, that I
should be wicked; he hoped for a recompense of his crime, and out of an
inhumanity which is without example, he has betrayed an innocent Princess, he
has put a stain upon my life which I shall not be able to deface, and has
reduced my soul to an estate never to be comforted. Then addressing his speech
to the Princess, as if she ^ould have heard him, and calling to mind her last
words, which he had caused to be repeated to him more than once, he cried out
with an exceeding transport, Yes, Axiamira, thy death shall be the cause of the
revenge which thou desire, and the grief which I shall have for it all my
life, shall be instead of an eternal punishment unto me: There needs no Arms
to invade my State; there needs no proclaimed Enemy to fight with me, I carry
o^e in my bosom which shall always surmount me; repentance and sorrow shall be
inseparably with my spirit, and the image of so unhappy, and of so beautiful a
person shall accompany me even to the grave. Soliman having been constrained by
the excess of his displeasure to give over speaking, I did what I could to
restore tranquillity to his soul, but his grief was so vive and so strong, as I
needed a great deal of time to vanquish, or to say better, to moderate it.
Behold, Madam, the History of the unfortunate Axiamira, all the particulars
whereof which I have told you, I learned from Rustan, and more too from one of
his soldiers, who returned a little after him, and was saved almost in the
same manner. Isabella could not then forbear interrupting of Justiniano, to
lament the misfortune of Axiamira, but after she had satisfied her compassion,
she desired to make an end of contenting her curiosity, and entreated
Justiniano to continue his discourse, which he did in this sort.

The Sequel of the History of Iustiniano.
I Will not stand, Madam, to relate unto you, how I employed my self after my
return from Natolia, in regard I know that Doria purposes to let you
understand, that Ibrahims Palace was built by my direction, and how it was in
that intervall of peace, and as soon as I was Grand Vizier, that I caused the
ornaments thereof to be made, having seen that work finished but a little
before Doriaes arrival at Constantinople. It is true, said Doria, that I have
a desire to describe that inchant^d Palace to her Excellency, and to acquaint
her with all the magnificences, and all the grandeurs which you have quitted
for her sake; and to make her comprehend a part of what I say, I am but to
present her with that which the Grand Signior has sent her; saying so, he drew
out of his pocket the box of gold which Soliman had delivered unto him, and
having opened it, he let her see one of the goodliest things in the world.
Isabella was so surprised with the richness of this present, as she would not
have received it, but at length Doria having told her laughing, that he was not
determined either to keep it, or to carry it back to Constantinople, she was
constrained to accept of it. Doriaes jesting made Justiniano fetch a great
sigh, beginning already to apprehend the end of his narration, and for that
cause had spun out that of the Adventures of Axiamira as much as possibly he
could, in exactly recounting her History; and all because he was not yet well
resolved whether he should deliver the truth of things to Isabella; in the mean
time, whereas she was in much impatience, and that night began to come on, she
desired him not to lose such precious minutes, but to prosecute his discourse.
I would willingly have had you dispense with me, answered Justiniano, for
leading you once more to the wars, but since you will be acquainted with all my
fortunes, I am to let you understand, that being absolutely determined not to
wear a Turbant unprofitably for Christendom, I had no other thought but to
divert the Arms of Soliman from Hungary, where I knew he had a design to employ
his greatest forces; the loss of Axiamira furnished me soon after with means to
put so just a resolution in effect: For whether it were, that some of the
Princesses women were saved by a prodigious good hap, and had acquainted
Tachmas with the cause of the death of his daughter; or that the abode, or
sudden departure of Rustan, who had always past at Mazanderon for a Merchant
of Constantinople, had begotten some suspicion of the truth, advertisement came
that Tachmas was levying a mighty Army: The Truce which had been so long
between these two Princes, could be no obstacle to this war, for it had never
been observed exactly; and some particulars had often committed acts of
hostility on either part, so that according to the Maxims of State, a plausible
pretext could not be wanting for an Army to march into the Orient, as often as
Soliman had a mind to it: In the mean time it happened that the Georgians
having past over Euphrates, did much spoil in Comagena, robbing all that went
to, or came from Mesopotamia, so that the Sangiacs of the Province having
complained of it, and seeing that Soliman took no order therein, they passed to
Diarbech, where in all the Country about Birtha they did great havoc, and
rendered that with usury which the Georgians had lent them. This conjuncture
seeming too favorable unto me to be neglected, I repaired unto Soliman, who
notwithstanding the advertisement he had received that Tachmas had put himself
into Arms, could not be drawn for all that to think of this war; the image of
Axiamira reigned still in his heart; he could not resolve to fight with the
Father, whose daughter he had caused to perish; and if some resentment of glory
had not been still remaining in him, I think he would rather have let Tachmas
invade his Empire, than oppose himself against him. But to show unto you how
hardly this Prince was drawn to make a war, which he believed to be unjust, I
have no more to say, than that after I had used all my address to remonstrate
unto him, that the war of Persia was a thing no longer in his choice, since
knowing what his Governors had done in Diarbech, and Tachmas having an Army on
foot, he was not to doubt, yea though he wre ignorant that he was the innocent
cause of Axiamiraes death, but that he would fall upon him; that after I had
told him how it was always advantageous for great Princes to begin the War;
that it was a mark of love to his Subjects, not to suffer the fire to be
brought into their houses; and that I had made him also to consider, that at
last it would be better to be in an estate to show grace to his Enemy, than to
receive it from him; that in this occasion it did not concern his particular
glory alone, but that of the Empire; that being innocent of the misfortune of
Axiamira, he was not to fear that heaven would be contrary to him; and that if
this death was to be lamented, it would suffice to employ his tears and sighs
therein, without beholding the blood of his Subjects shed. After all these
things, I say, he made no other answer, but Axiamira is dead for me, I must
sacrifice a part of my State for her; and that my Subjects may not murmr at
the Conquests which I shall suffer Tachmas to gain upon me, I will labor to
obtain others of the Christians, without obliging thee, as I have promised, to
serve me therein. I vow unto you, Madam, that this discourse surprised me
extremely, not knowing which way to oppose my self against a will so fully
determined: And that which put me into further despair of being able to execute
my design was, that the Mother and Wife of the Emperor hated me with a secret
hatred, because I had always favored Mustapha and Gianger, excellent Princes,
and the children of Soliman; for though this last be the son of Roxelana, yet
leaves she not to hate him, because he loves Mustapha: This hatred was the
cause then that these two women opposed the voyage of Persia, only to
contradict ^e, with so much address and violence, as I stood in need of some
extraordinary mean to destroy all their artifices. The first represented unto
Soliman, that the wars of the Orient had always been unfortunate to the
Othomans; that his Armies would be exterminated with hunger and thirst, if he
carried them to a place from whence his father Selim, although victorious,
brought back no other advantage, than the loss of his best soldiers. As for
Roxelana, she employed nothing but her tears, wherewith alone she was more
powerful than reason it self; so that all these things being joined to the
loss of Axiamira, wrought in such sort, as I saw almost an impossibility in
diverting the storm which was ready to fall on Christendom: But in the end,
after I had tried all ways in vain, I bethought my self, how Soliman being
mightily persuaded that Judiciary Astrology is a Science which men may practice
with certainty, I might peradventure bring him to what I desired, if I could
get an Arabian to come from Damascus, that was an excellent Astrologer and
Mathematician, called Mule Aral, whom the people accused of Magic, by reason
of the wonders which every day he did; hoping, after I had won him with gifts,
to make him say unto Soliman whatsoever I would have him. I sent then secretly
unto Damascus, not knowing how to meet with any other expedient that could
satisfy me otherwise; and whereas my orders were as well executed as the Grand
Signiors, it was not long before he was brought to me. In the mean space I was
resolved to speak no more of this war to Soliman, until such time as that
which I projected should utterly fail me. As soon as Mule Aral was arrived at
Constantinople, I talked with him in private, and after I had engaged him
absolutely to do what I would have him, I discovered my design unto him, which
nevertheless I covered with the good and glory of the Empire, to the end too he
might serve me the more faithfully. But this man told me, how he held it fit
that the Stars should be observed, and his books consulted with a little about
this war, because it might so happen, that without any imposture or lying he
should be obliged to persuade Soliman to this voyage; and howsoever, though the
stars did not concur with our intentions, yet would he be sure to keep his word
with me. I parted with him in this manner, having first entreated him to make a
show of the best effects of his Science at the Port, that so the Emperor might
give the more credit to that which he was to say unto him. Mule Aral failed not
in obeying me, for he had not been a week at Constantinople, but every one
spoke of the prodigies he did; and whereas he was a great Physiognimist, he got
a world of reputation in a short time. He foretold to some that they should die
the next day, which failed not to fall out accordingly; to others he revealed
the most secret adventures of their lives; and he was so happy, that of all the
things which he assured, none mist, or at leastwise might receive a favorable
interpretation; so that the report hereof being come to Soliman, he sent for
Mule Aral, who in his presence told the Bassa of the Sea such things, as
extremely surprised him; for he confessed, that every particular of that which
he had told him, had befallen him accordingly. The grand Signior commanded him
to follow him into his Cabinet, where, as I knew afterward, he declared unto
him the most special passages of his life, and principally his love to Axiamira
upon the sight of her picture, although I had not spoken to him of it; so as
Soliman being mightily persuaded of the Science of this man, asked him whether
he thought that the war against the Persians would be prosperous. But Mule, who
desired to finish his figures and observations, and to give the more weight to
that which he should say, answered Soliman, that things past were seen with
more certainty in the physiognomy, than things to come; and that for an affair
of so great importance, he demanded of him only six days to satisfy him fully:
and for the better carrying of the matter, he besought him to let him know the
precise point of his nativity, albeit he had been acquainted with it before by
me. Soliman accorded him his desire, and having given him leave to depart,
rested so satisfied of him, as he was already disposed to govern his designs by
Mule Aral's answer; who after he had made his observations, came one evening to
me with a contented look, and assured me, that his Science was false, or I
should Crown Soliman King of Persia. It is certain, Madam, that I did not
believe the discourse of this man, but only seemed to give credit to his
words, to the end I might not disoblige him, although the success of things
afterward made it good. The next day he went to Soliman, and with a confident
countenance told him, that the war of Hungary would prove unlucky to him if he
undertook it, but that of Persia glorious; and assured him further, that if he
entered first into the Enemies Country, one of his Slaves, whom he very much
loved, should Crown him King of Persia. Mule accompanied this discourse with so
many circumstances, which would be too long to repeat, as at length Soliman,
who was very scrupulous in all things, which he believed came from above,
prepared himself for this war with as much precipitation, as he had had
repugnancy to it before. As soon as Mule was gone, he sent for me, to command
me to alter all the directions which he had given, and to cause all the Troops
to be enrolled for Persia: And whereas this Prince carried an unmeasurable
affection to me, he had charged Mule not to discover any thing of that to me
which he had said to him, desiring to make me believe how it was in
consideration of me that he withdrew his Arms from Christendom, thereby to
engage me the more to his service. Whilst things were in this estate, an
accident fell out which began to give great hope of this voyage of Persia, and
to confirm Soliman in the good opinion which he had of Mule Aral; for it happened
that one Ulama, Satrape of Caramania, a man of great account with the Sophy,
who had married one of his sisters to him, and though she dyed a little after
this Marriage, yet did this alliance render him more considerable than before.
This man, I say, having received some outrage from that Prince, after he had
served him in diverse incounters with the expense of his blood, requested of me
that I would obtain some place of safety for him within Solimans Dominions. I
will not tell you, Madam, what this excellent man did in this war, since it is
certain, that his generous actions do well deserve a relation in particular;
neither will I stand to recount this voyage exactly unto you; wherefore, that I
may not abuse your patience, and make the best use of the rest of the day, I
will only tell you, Madam, that having had a Commandment to conduct the
Vant-Guard with Ulama, I was so fortunate as I surprised Tauris without any
resistance, which at the first astonished the Enemies, who nevertheless left
not to defend themselves courageously in all other incounters. Tachmas
performed wonders in his own person, and so did also one Deliment; but at
length fortune in two ranged battles declared her self for us; so that as soon
as Soliman was arrived in person, he had almost no other employment than to
receive the Deputies of Towns which submitted to his obedience. A part of
Assyria and Mesopotamia were subjected unto him, but in such sort, and so
absolutely, that from the Mart of Balzera, which stands at the mouth of
Euphrates, entering into the Gulf of Persia, even to the last Town, they rendered
all unto him. The most notable of this great number were Caramida, Medinum,
Orfa and Ancefa; but that which Soliman rejoiced most at, was the reduction of
Bagdet, where he was Crowned King of Persia by the hands of the Caliph, who to
do me honor, and to testify that I had contributed somewhat to the happy
success of this war, would needs have me serve in the Ceremony, and help him to
set the Crown on the head of Soliman; so that by this circumstance nothing was
more to be added to Mule Arals Predictions, who at our return was recompensed
sufficiently. After this, his Highness bestowed some time in giving directions
for all things before his return to Constantinople, where he was resolved to be
received in triumph, but a little sickness that he fell into by the way
deferred this public rejoicing, which nevertheless was performed within a
while after; and I may say that this Triumph was as happy for me, as it was
glorious for Soliman, seeing it was there that I came to know Doria in the
habit of a Slave, who can recount unto you, Madam, that fortunate days passage
more agreeably than I could. Justiniano, having said this, became so confused,
as if one of the Princesses Gentlemen had not advertised her, that the Count of
Lavagna, accompanied with the Marquis of Touraine, was come to visit her in the
behalf of the Senate, she had perceived the disorder of his spirit: After she
had heard the message that was brought her, she rose up, and giving her hand to
Justiniano, she said unto him with a very well satisfied countenance, Do not
think to lay upon your friend the trouble to acquaint me with the rest of your
Adventures, he has had enough already in going to Constantinople to justify
me unto you, besides what he is to be at in relating to me that which has
arrived to himself in particular; but to let you see, continued she, that I am
not tyrannical, I will give you time to content my curiosity, in the mean
space I think it fit we should go and receive the Civilities of the Senate:
Their said, she suffered her self to be lead in one hand by Justiniano, and in
the other by Doria, whom she had retained as he was about to withdraw, and the
rest of the troop followed after. All the way Isabella continually admired the
mavelous effects of Justiniano's fortune, but in what manner soever she
considered them, she still returned to speak of the obligation wherein he stood
engaged to Soliman: I must confess, said she to Justiniano, that if this Prince
be such as you have delivered him, he may be styled the wonder of our Age, and
if my Religion did not forbid it me, I would quit my Country with joy to live
under his Dominion. This discourse made Justiniano to tremble, but Doria laying
hold on her speech, confirmed her yet more in the advantageous opinion which
she had of Soliman, and Justiniano being come to himself again, assured her
that all which he had said of him was very far short of the truth. This fair
Troop entertained themselves in this sort, until that being arrived near to
the Castle, the Count and the Marquis came to meet the Princess, who
entertained them with a great deal of respect. The Count, to acquit himself of
the Commission which the Senate had given him, said unto her, that he was not
come only to congratulate with her for the happy return of Justiniano, but also
to give her thanks for it, as the most important service that ever she could
have rendered to the Republique; that this favor from Heaven was doubtless due
to her virtue, and to the vows she had made for him, rather than to the
desires of the Senate, who had rendered themselves unworthy of it; how to
testify unto her, that the present had utterly defaced the remembrance of the
past, he entreated her that she would honor Genoua with her presence, whenas
she had resolved upon the triumph of Justiniano, to the end that by the pomp
and magnificence which they would bring unto it, they might at leastwise
testify their joy, although they could not testify their acknowledgement.
This discourse made Justinianoes heart to pant, and the Princess to change
color; for she understood well enough, that the triumph he spoke of, was to be
her marriage. She answered with very much modesty, that general causes being
without doubt more favored of Heaven, than particular interests, it was to be
certainly believed, that Justiniano had been restored to his Country for the
only glory of the Republic; and that having nevertheless encountered her
particular felicity in this general happiness, she had more reason to give
thanks unto the Senate, than to receive any from them; but, continued she,
interrupting Justiniano, who would have answered that which she had said of
him, it will be more convenient for us to enter into the Castle for to tell you
there what I think of it, than to stay any longer in a place which the night
that is now at hand would render incommodious. The Count then presented the
Marquis of Touraine unto her, whom they called at Genoua the French Marquis,
and assured her that he was a man whose condition and merit were not unworthy
of her knowledge and esteem. There needs no more, said the Princess, to commend
and render him agreeable to me, than that he is your friend, and that you
esteem of him; whereupon she entertained him with a great deal of courtesy, and
the Marquis saluting her with very much respect, besought her to judge of him
by the Counts opinion, rather than by his own, whenas he should have the honor
to be known of her. After this complement, the Princess presented her hand to
the Count, and looking on Justiniano, Doria, and the French Marquis, as though
she had been sorry that she could not share her Civilities amongst them,
universal beauties were the object of their entertainment, during the little
way that remained for them to go. The situation of this place is so delicate,
the prospect of it so pleasant, and the setting of the Sun was that evening so
glorious, with the diversity of vive and rich colors, which the gold of his
Rays imprinted on the Clouds, and reflected on the Sea, as it is not to be
thought strange, that a discourse so common should make up the conversation of
such extraordinary persons. As for Doria, he went along talking to the French
Marquis, who led Aemilia by the arm, that seemed not unpleasing to him: And in
this manner they entered into the Castle, where the Princess treated them as
magnificently, as if she had been prepared of a long time to receive them.

Here ends the first Part.
IBRAHIM: OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The second part.
The first BOOK.
PResently after supper the Princess, perceiving that the Marquis was gone from
the company, demanded of the Count whether it were true that he had brought the
French liberty into Genoua, as he had formerly told her during the time of her
solitariness. It is so true (answered the Count) that if you knew in what
fashion we live, you would be surprised with it; Howbeit your amazement would
cease as soon as you should know the wit, humor, and address of the French
Marquis. And seeing his precepts are not opposite to pleasure, but yet
conserving Virtue with a great deal of respect, he was not much troubled to
find out followers, both amongst the men and the Ladies. But is it possible
(said Justiniano) that he could vanquish that jelousie which is so natural to
those of our Nation? He has for that (replied the Count) made use of an
artifice, which he alone was able to invent: He observed within a little time,
after I had made him known to all the persons of quality, every love in Genoua,
and wrought so well by his address, that in a short while he was the universal
confident thereof. When as he saw himself master of all men's secrets, he began
to persuade us all in particular to the French liberty; to call us Tyrants over
our wives; and to make us comprehend that there was extreme injustice in
prohibiting conversation unto Ladies, who alone could render it agreeable; That
as for him, he was resolved to make them happy whether they would or no: and
for that effect (said he unto us) all they that have sisters must permit me to
see and talk with them, to the end that having made them know, how Virtue ought
not to be untractable, and how they think more harm when they are by
themselves, than they would do if they knew us more particularly, I may make
that succeed which I have projected for your advantage. Besides (said he unto
us) this essay cannot be dangerous; for whereas I never have an affection that
lasts above a week, you need not fear that I shall make any great progress
therein. Each one in particular durst not refuse him that which he demanded, as
being his confident; so that in a short time he was introduced into all the
Houses of quality, mauger the severity of fathers, and the reservedness of
mothers. For he has so complying a spirit, that he knows how to take upon him
all forms; and for gallantry, no man can be so proper for it as he: he sings
very sweetly; he plays upon the Lute and the Gittern; he daunces with a good
grace; he limnes and paints well; he writes excellent letters; he makes verses
in our tongue, as if he were an Italian; and his conversation is so
intertaining, that it is as impossible to be without friendship for him, as for
him to be without affection. Whereupon it is easy to imagine that he had
quickly persuaded that which he desired. But to begin the introduction of the
thing publicly, one day when there was a bal, and the company assembled
together, he approached boldly to the principal mayds of the City; for he
feared not so much the brothers as the husbands; and told them openly, he was
ashamed for them, that they should be separated from the rest of the company,
as if they were unworthy to be of it: and then he made a Satyr against that
custom, which he must one day rehearse unto you. When as every one took
delight herein, and that he knew he should be supported by all the young folks,
and that the Ladies in their hearts wished him no hurt, he desired all the
company, that they would for this evening only carry themselves as if they
were in France, and follow his directions, to the end he might at leisure make
the Ladies see, who do not travel, the difference that was between the one and
the other. Hereupon all those of his faction cried it up with a great applause,
and his advice was followed, although there were some that did not allow of it:
The women also made some difficulty thereof; but at last the Marquis prevailed.
He changed then the whole Order of the company, saying it was the custom of
France, that conversation should be the greatest pleasure of a bal; so that he
played the master of the Ceremonies in such manner, as in placing every one,
without showing himself affected therein, he placed each one according to his
inclination. After that, it was a good while before he would suffer the Violins
to play, that the more commodity might be given to talk; and in this sort,
every one for his particular interest, found himself so satisfied, as there was
not any but avowed, that they had taken more delight in this assembly, than in
all the rest that ever had been. Since that, he has wrought so well with nine
or ten interessed persons, as we meet two or three times a week five or six
families together, where verily he delivers such pleasing things, as cannot be
repeated unto you, without losing much of their grace. It must be acknowledged
(said the Princess) that this is a rare man, and deserves that I should inform
my self by what happy adventure he has preferred Italy before France, for I
have heard that he is a man of quality. You have reason, Madam (said the Count)
to call it happy for us, but it has not been happy for him, though the end was
to him glorious. I believe (said Justiniano interrupting him) that her
excellency would be well contented to understand his fortune. And I (replied
the Count) to obey her, if I did not fear that the Marquis will not give me
leisure for it, but will come and interrupt my recital thereof. I am much
deceived (said Doria) if he do not give you all the opportunity you can desire;
for I have well observed that the fair Emilia has not displeased him; and
that being gone from hence, because she was not well, he followed her carefully
with his eyes, and if I mistake not, he is gone to seek out some occasion to
see her, or to premeditate some letter, or verses to express his passion. The
Count being of Doriaes opinion, yielded to the request which the Princess had
made him, and began to speak in these terms.

The History of the French Marquis.
I shall tell you then, Madam, that the Marquis is of an illustrious House, and
of a Province in France, the name whereof is not in my remembrance; and without
particularising any thing more of his life, than the last action which gave him
unto us, you are to know that his virtue begot him envy, and consequently
enemies in his country. And whereas he had always lived at court, and in the
wars, the late King Francis showed him a great deal of respect and good will,
although he was as then but very young. He had not been wanting then at the
battle of Pavy, where he had performed wonders in person, and so happily for
his glory, as the King himself had been a witness of his valor; yet were there
afterward for all that three Gentlemen in his Country, whereof the one was
called Marse, the second Beniers, and the other Dincourt, amongst whom fell out
a quarrel, occasioned by the doubt of his valor. Marse had hated the Marquis
of a long time, so as it is credible, that being unable to find out any other
means to deface his glory, he published openly, albeit neither he, nor the
other two, had ever parted from their houses during the war, that the Marquis
had fled from the battle of Pavy. This discourse coming to the Kings ear, at
such time as the Marquis was not at the Court, nor had heard any thing that was
spoken against him, this Prince, who loved him dearly, thought he should oblige
him, it he sought further into the matter. He sends for Marse then to know of
him from whom he had received that which he had reported: Marse answers that a
Gentleman, named Dincourt, had assured it unto him, and Dincourt appearing
said, that contrarily Marse had told him, how he had heard it from one called
Beniers. Dincourt seeing that Marse did not contradict him, besought the King
that he might not be involved in this affayr; the King grants his request,
returns him home, and commands Beniers to present himself, as he does: the King
demands of him whether he had told Marse, that the Marquis had fled from the
Battle of Pavy: Beniers stoutly maintains that he had never said any such
thing, and gives the other the lie. The King, who was willing to force two men,
who had not been in the wars, to fight, told them, that to discover which of
them had been the author of this falsehood, he would have them fight a single
combat, and that he would honor it with his presence. They accept of it, and
the next day, the lists being prepared, and the King being placed on a scaffold
with all his Court, and environed with a great multitude of people, he sees
Beniers appear, conducted by a gentleman of his friends; and Marse at the other
end of the field brought in by one of his kinsmen. Beniers would needs fight
with two swords, and but half armed; so that either of them had a Co^slet on
with long tasses, sleeves of mail, gantlets, a cask on his head, a sword in his
right hand, and another in his left, with each of them a dagger by his side.
This new spectacle drew the eyes of everyone upon them, but at length, after
the sound of trumpets, the oaths, and other ceremonies requisite in such like
actions, they began their combat, wherein they both showed a great deal of
adress and valor. At the first Marse seemed to have some advantage of the
other, he appeared more active, more ardent, and more vigorous; but toward the
midst of the combat it was easy to judge, that Beniers had made spare of his
forces to give the other leisure to spend his. Marse grew faint, and the other
so courageous, as no man had ever seen one fight more valiantly. They were a
long time before they could hurt one another; for it happened that those two
swords, which each of them had, and that carried terror by the eyes to the
heart of those who beheld two men armed in that manner, were notwithstanding
against their intention a means to make the combat endure; in regard that the
left hand sword served to ward the blows which they gave one another, as well
as if each of them had had a buckler. When they perceived that their own arms
kept them from destroying themselves, they cast away their swords both at once,
and falling a grapling together with a great deal of precipitation they had
recourse to their daggers: But Beniers being the stronger, and the more
delyver, has Marse down under him, and his hand wherewith he held his dagger
being engaged under the others, Beniers seeks for nothing else but a place not
defended by his cuirace where he might kill him, and already had he his arm
lifted up for to stabb him, when as the King, who would not lose a man which
had showed so much courage, threw down his warder in the midst of the field to
make them leave off, which caused the people to give a great shout for joy,
whereat Benires turning his head about gave Marse opportunity to disingage
himself, and in this manner the Kings authority finished their combat. But
admire, Madam, the caprichiousness of chance, by this which I am coming to tell
you: The Marquis, about whom the quarrel was, arrives in post at the very same
Town, where the combat was fought; he asks where the King is? and whereas the
people are never well informed of things, he is only told, that he is beholding
a combat, which he has permitted unto two Gentlemen, who had required it of
him. This novelty touches him with curiosity; he goes without further inquiry,
or any thought that he had any interest in this affair: he comes thither, he
beholds the combat a while amongst the multitude, makes vows for Marse, whose
demeanor and personage pleased him, wishes against his own proper interest that
he may carry away the victory, and without knowing it takes his enemies part.
But one of his friends having perceived him, approaches to him, and in few
words ^^counts him the whole matter, and withal possesses the mind of the
Marquis with shame, despite, and fury. There is one then (said he unto him
that had acquainted him with this bad news) which dares accuse me of
cowardice; and even the King, who knows full well whether I fled from the
battle or no, in stead of punishing this Impostor, does him the grace to
permit him the combat; renders himself judge of it, is ready to heap glory on
him, and to declare him victor if he surmounts his enemy. No, no, I cannot
suffer it, and I must cast my self disarmed as I am, into the midst of the
lists; I must fight with them both together, or asunder, it matters not which,
so as I may be revenged, or die gloriously. As he was in this resolution the
King threw down his warder to make the combat cease; and though the Marquis his
mind was much troubled, yet had he observed that Beniers was in a condition to
be victorious over his enemy, at such time as the King had given that signal
of peace; which put him into such strange choler, as he resolved to break
through the press, to go present himself, and in person demand satisfaction
for the outrage had been done him by so black a calumny. What (said he to
himself, in seeking still to approach nearer) the King takes care for the life
of a man that spoils me in my honor! he has not permitted the combat then,
but out of hope that my enemy would vanquish, since as soon as it appeared that
he had the worst, he retained the hand of him that would have stabbed him, and
saved the other from the punishment which he was going to receive: But it is
just that he should perish by my hand; and that I should be revenged by my
relf. In the mean time the press was so great, and the people so thronged
together for to hear what the King said to Marse and his adversary, as the
Marquis could not come near him, till he had told them, that their courage had
obliged him from having either of them acknowledged for the calumniator: and
that in persuance of this grace he commanded them to publish every where, how
they knew from his mouth, that the Marquis had been one of the foremost in the
front of the battle; that he had been one of the last which he had seen
fighting about him; and that if all the rest had done their devoir as well as
he, he had not lost his liberty. Then turning himself to the principal persons
of his Court, I am (said he) a witness of that which I say; and if any one dare
make any doubt of my speech, I will make him feel what the displeasure of an
incensed Prince is. The Marquis seeing the King leave off speaking, cast
himself at his feet, and surprised in such sort, both the Court, his enemies,
and the King himself, as it was a good while before he could be heard, so
great was the murmr. But at length, after the people had been commanded to
silence, the Marquis spoke to him much after this manner. I know very well,
Sir, since your Majesty is satisfied of my courage, that I should be so too;
but it is not sufficient for your glory, that they whom you favor should be
valiant, they ought also for the justifying of your judgment to be thought
such by all the world; And therefore (if I may be permitted to speak so) I
cannot endure that they, who have traduced me two hundred leagues from the
battle, should not by experience undestand, that I know not how to recoil,
either in a general, or particular combat: Grant me then out of justice that,
which you have granted out of grace to mine enemy; your equity and your glory
is concerned herein, and you cannot refuse me the combat which I demand,
without covering me with shame and confusion. The King having attentively heard
him, said, that his resentment was noble, but he could not for his own glory
accord him that which he desired: That the public testimony which he had
given of his valor, was more glorious than the death of his enemy, who by his
commandment would be constrained to publish all his lifetime the contrary of
that which he had reported; That if he should permit him the combat, he should
seem to posterity, that he himself had made doubt of his valor; that it would
be to equal him with his enemy, which by no means he would do, neither was it
just he should. The Marquis, hearing the King speak after this sort, was so
seized with spite and grief, as he could not answer him. In the mean time the
King, advising with the chiefest of his Court about what satisfaction he might
give the Marquis, never heeded his going away; for suddenly thrusting himself
amongst the press, he did so, as before he could be followed he took post, and
went and hid himself in one of his friends house, forty Leagues off, with an
intent not to stir from thence but to be revenged. The King was much offended
with this action of his, and although he loved the Marquis exceedingly, yet his
authority seeming to be contemned thereby, he testified a great deal of
displeasure for it. He charged Marse not fight with him, and yet commanded him
to acknowledge every where, how that which he had said was false. This while
the Marquis caused his enemy to be observed, and received news of whatsoever
passed at Court; and whereas he has a great and generous spirit, the
alteration of the Kings favor toward him touched him so sensibly, as he
desired his friends not to think of restoring him thereunto: He took order
secretly for his affairs, settled his estate, raised a mass of money, great
enough to undertake a long voyage; and that done, resolves to fight, not only
with Marse, but also with Beniers, not knowing, said he, whether he had not
spoken that which he disavowed; and after all, to quit the Kingdom for ever.
But the latter gave him not leave to execute his design; for he died of
sickness. As for Marse, as soon as he knew that he was returned into his
country, he sent him a challenge; whereunto he answers, that in regard of the
Kings charge to the contrary, he could not accept of it. The Marquis netled
with this refusal, resolved to force him to fight; and watching for him a good
while after in a Wood, that was not far from Marses house, and whither he went
oftentimes to walk, he perceived one morning a Provost-Marshall, accompanied
with two of his fellows, who came along thorough the Forest; he hid himself
for fear of discovery, and heard that one of them named him, and said that the
King would have him apprehended if he could be found. This discourse obliged
him to follow them afar off; but he was much astonished when he saw them enter
into Marses house: whereupon he no longer doubted, but that it would be
impossible for him of a long time to find an opportunity to fight with him. He
informs himself more particularly of the business; remains certain days about
this house, and at length learns, that the Provost-Marshall was sent to Marse
to apprehend him; for the King had been advertised both of his retreat, and of
the time when he departed to return into his Country; So that oppressed with
many misfortunes, he resolved to go and pass away certain months in some other
place, hoping that in the mean time they might peradventure be wearied with
continual guarding of Marse. He went then into Provence for his more security,
where one of his particular friends lived, that was retired from the Court.
Being there, he understands that the Kings displeasure is pacified, and that
his enemy is dead; so that the impossibility which he saw to be revenged,
makes him take the resolution never to appear again at a Court, whose Prince
had not entreated him very well. He passes into Italy, as being Master of
his Actions and Estate; and after he had seen all that is remarkable on this
side the mountains, he stayed in the end at Genoua, where such pleasant things
have arrived unto him, as one would hardly believe they were true, they were
so extraordinary. You have much obliged me, said the Princess, by acquainting
me with all these passages; but I would fain know, what cause Marse had so
to hate him? I rather think Madam (replied the Count) that there was some love
in the quarrel; if I be not deceived, Marse had four sisters, and the Marquis
but one; and they were both neighbors together in the country, so that
visiting one another very often, according to the custom of France, Marse fell
in love with the Marquis his Sister, and the Marquis, who always returns Love
with usury, became enamoured of all his four at once. He loved the eyes of the
one, the stature of the other, the voice of the third, and the wit of the last.
And in these four mayds, he said that he had the most accomplished Mistress in
the world. This folly lasted long enough to give Marse leisure to become
desperately in love with the Marquis his sister, who at her brothers entreaty
had entertained him very civily during certain months that he was away in the
Province, albeit she could by no means endure him. In the mean while the time
of his return being come, Marse begins to think seriously of his affairs,
believes they will succeed well; and finding that the Marquis took great
delight in resorting to his house, thinks to give him the choice of his four
sisters, and by that exchange hopes to establish his felicity, and possess his
Mistress. He imployes one therein, who was a friend both to him and the Marquis;
gives him order to discover which of his Sisters he has a mind to, that he may
prepare her to intertain him the better. This friend acquits himself
dexterously of his Commission, he repairs to the Marquis, speaks to him of
Marses Sisters, and demands of him which of them pleases him most. He answers,
that they please him all alike; that the eldest is plump, fair-hayr'd,
white-skin'd; that she has a great deal of sweetness in her eyes, and in her
humor, but that it is great pity she is no taller. This man, who was called
Alsac, believed that this was she which touched the Marquis his heart, since he
found but this little defect in her. But the other proceeding on in his
discourse, he thought it was the second; for (said the Marquis) the
advantageous stature of the next; that stately look; that dark hair; that ovall
visage; and that noble pride, which appears in her port and all her actions,
would render her incomparable, were her complexion somewhat clearer, and that
she spoke a little more than she does. I was deceived (said Alsac then) and it
is this same that has vanquished him. But (continued the Marquis) the mouth of
the third; her white teeth; that quaintness which she has in the air of her
face; that merry and joviall humor; and that which goes beyond all the rest,
that charming and passionate voice, which she governs with so much art, gives
her such a grace, as would make her surmount all hearts, were it not for a
little inequality of humor that appears in her. Nay now I know not which of
them it is, said Alsac to himself; but for the last (continued the Marquis) it
must be acknowledged, that that fresh and vermilion hew, proceeding from her
youth, which may be named the soul of beauty; those sparkling eyes; that black
hair; that comely neck; that mean and well proportioned stature; those white
hands; and that which is most mavelous in the age of fifteen years, that
nimble wit, which renders her the entertainment of a company; which makes her
talk very agreeably of all matters; and which puts a particular charm into
every part of her; deserves almost the whole heart of a worthy man, if she did
not live in the Country, and had but for six months only breathed the air of
the great world: but that original sin which takes off much of her value, and
the sole thought that she is a country Gentlewoman, is a sovereign preservative
for a man of the Court. Alsac was then very much perplexed; howbeit he
conceived that the obstacle which the Marquis brought to this last, was the
least considerable; and that thereby he would conceal his passion. But this
conjecture was not for all that so strong, as he durst settle his judgment on
it, as on an indubitable thing. He presses the Marquis yet in another manner,
and precisely demands of him, whether he be in love or no; the Marquis, who
thought he was not to speak seririously, answers, that he is, more than all the
men of the world; the other entreats him to tell him with whom; and the
Marquis, who believes that this man has no hidden design, is contented to tell
him, for to keep him still in doubt, that it suffices he assures him, how in
that which he loves, all the beauties of the body, and all the graces of the
mind, are incountred; and that a masterpiece of Nature might be made of it, if
one could see together, what he loves asunder. Alsac comprehended nothing by
this discourse, although it were true in the Marquis his sense, who indeed was
in love with these four maids; in each of which he found things that touched
his heart, and others that did not please him.

This man then being in despair of being able to acquit himself of his
Commission, enquires howsoever, whether it be at Court, or in the Country, that
he loves? The Marquis answers, how it is in the Coutry that he loves, and after
this they part. Alsac goes to Marse, and tells him that all the fruit of his
voyage is, how he certainly knows that the Marquess is in love in their
Country, and that of necessity it must be in his house, since there were no
other Gentlewomen thereabout; but to understand precisely which of his Sisters
held the chiefest place in his heart, was impossible for him to discover, so
well had he spoken to him of all four; howbeit it seemed to him that the last
touched him a little more than the rest; but this too was so uncertain, as he
counseled him not to rely on it. Marse finds himself hereupon sufficiently
troubled, howsoever he resolvs to clear himself therein, and believes that
entertaining all his Sisters, one by one in particular, he may discover the
truth; it being impossible, said he, but that I shall observe by their
countenances, to which of them he has spoken seriously of love. He sends for
the eldest to him into his Cabinet, speaks to her with a great deal of
testimony of good will, and to oblige her the more easily to discover her heart
unto him, he assures her that he thinks of nothing with more care, than to
establish her Fortune; that he should hardly resolve to marry before her; and
at length, having made a turn or two, he demands of her whether the Marquis had
ever given her any particular proofs of his affection, and whether that match
would be agreeable unto her. This proposition having made her blush, she
answers, casting down her eyes, that in this occasion she had no other will but
his, and that she was ready to obey him. How it was true, that the Marquis had
testified that he greatly esteemed her, and that in an hundred encounters he
still seemed to prefer her before the rest; and that she also had known how to
acknowledge his merit to the prejudice of them that came near him; but that for
three or four days since he had applied himself more in talking to the third
than he was accustomed to do. This Maid giving no further marks in this
discourse of the love the Marquis bore her, than that which she bore to him by
the jealousy which she showed, Marse was at a nonplus; he perceives by his
Sisters speech, that the Marquis had spoken to her of love; that she did not
hate him; and that she suspects notwithstanding that he has a mind to her
which sings, although according to Alsacs opinion it should be to the youngest.
Howbeit he conceals his unquietness from his Sister, and resolves to sound them
all, charging this not to speak a word to the rest of what had past between
them. She withdraws, and the s^^ond arrives with a look and a modesty that made
him believe he should be much troubled to draw any thing out of her concerning
that which he desired to know. But he was much amaz^d, when as at the first
proposition which he made to her of it, she freely told him, but with some
little preparation before hand, that she believed the Marquis loved her eldest
as a Sister; that he delighted to hear the third sing; that the wit of the last
did not displease him; but as for her, she thought that he had given her such
tokens of his esteem of her, as he had given to none of the rest; and that he
had at sundry times spoken to her in that manner, as she could no longer doubt
of it. Howbeit, that for three or four days last past, she thought that to
spite her, or to make her more favorable unto him, he had caused one of her
Sisters to sing more, and had eyed the youngest more than he used to do. That
as for her, she could always rule her will by his, but if he would permit her
to speak the truth, she must confess unto him, that she could be contented to
marry with a Courtier, being so strongly dis-inclined from the Country, as she
could hardly resolve to talk with them that came to visit her. Her Brother
promises to do what he can to content her, and having charged her to be
secret, he dismisses her, and sends for the third. What shall I make of all
this (said Marse to himself) I cannot learn yet whether the Marquis be truly in
love or no, however I am sure that I have two Sisters which are already
desperately in love with him, but it may be, continued he, that the other two
will clear this enigma unto me. In the mean time she whom he had sent for
appears with her jocund humor; she demands of him at the first dash, whether
it were to propound a Lover unto her that he had sent for her so in secret; he
answers her, that she was not deceived, for indeed it was to ask of her whether
the affection of the Marquis did satisfy her? She replies laughing, that the
obligation which she had unto him for having taught her so many excellent ayrs,
for having taken such pains to make her sing well, and to tune her Lute to her
voice, deserved that her answer should be favorable unto him. But, said Marse
to her, speak seriously, for though you be the third, yet if the Marquis loves
you, you shall be the first married. Can you doubt of it, said she? and see you
not that the conformity which is between us must needs produce a fair
affection? He is merry, I am not melancholic; he understands music, and I can
sing; he plays on the Lute, and so do I; he dances admirably, and I do not
dance with an ill grace; in conclusion, there is a kind of I know not what
invisible thing, called, as I think, Sympathy, which makes us that we cannot
hate one another. I but, replied Marse, this is not enough, and you must tell
me more seriously whether he loves you. Expect not any thing more serious from
me, said she, for I should cease to be that I am, and peradventure should not
please the Marquis, if I were wiser; wherefore be pleased to let me tell you
only, that if he speaks to you with as good a grace when he demands me of you,
as he did in discovering his passion unto me, I shall not answer him cruelly.
After this she went away singing a Song which the Marquis had made for her, and
left Marse so confounded, as he could scarcely believe what he had heard. But
at length the last arrives, and whereas he knows that she had more wit than the
rest, he also imployes more art in speaking to her: He cajols and carresses
her; calls her his Favorite, and his dearest Sister; and after an hundred
protestations of good will, conjures her to deal ingenuously with him; and to
oblige her the more, confesses unto her, that he is in an extreme passion for
the Marquis his Sister; and believing that he is so too for her, he desires her
to tell him the truth of it, and if it be so, to use him kindly, for fear he
should oblige his Sister to oppose his affection. She answers thereunto with a
great deal of wit, that she would think her self infinitely happy to be
sacrifised for the felicity of her Brother; but as for that which concerned the
Marquis, she was to tell him, that her life had not yet been long enough to be
able to discern a feigned affection from a true; that it was so little a while
since one had given over entreating her like a Girl, that she durst not as yet
rely on her judgment; that indeed it was true, the Marqu^^ had taken some such
particular care of her, as made her think he did not wish her ill; and whereas
he was the first worthy man that had spoken civilly unto her, she confessed
freely unto him, she could not choose but be obliged to him for it; but that
therein she promised to follow his directions exactly. The address of this maid
was not such, but that her Brother perceived by the change of her countenance
that the Marquis pleased her more than she made show of: But whereas he desired
to have the liberty to think of so strange an adventure, he sends her away,
injoyns her to be secret, and assures her that he will always testify that
she is dearer to him than his other Sisters. When she was gone, he fell a
walking up and down (for the Marquis knew all these things afterward by the
third of these Gentlewomen, who out of the conformity that was betwixt them
continued still his friend, maugre all their disorders) and having been a while
without speaking; What, said he, the Marquis shall make my four Sisters be in
love with him, whilst himself peradventure is not taken by any of them, and I
shall be so unhappy as not be able to touch the inclination of his one? He will
laugh in his mind at his conquests, and my misfortune; and whilst to the
prejudice of my house he shall be laden with the favors of four maids, I shall
get but cold civilities from her, whom I love passionately, and that alone can
make up my felicity. But, continued he, what counsel can I take? If I have
recouse to violence; if I quarrel with him; if I fight with him, and will make
him explain himself by force, for the interest of my Sisters, then I ruin my
self with her; I lose the hope of ever possessing her; and it would be an ill
way for one to prove his love unto a generous person, to kill her Brother. It
is better for me then to dissemble a while; to observe all his actions; to
endeavor yet to discover whom the Marquis is in love withal; and if at last I
can learn nothing certain, then to propound unto him the choice of my Sisters,
in demanding of his. Behold in what sort Marse reasoned with himself about so
intricate an affair (at leastwise he has recounted it since in this manner.)
But as Marse was thus troubled at home, so was the Marquis in some sort with
his Sister, who having another design with her self than the marrying of Marse,
would have him dispense with her for entertaining him any longer, and permit
her to take all hope from him. Howbeit the Marquis, who could not endure that
his Sisters rigor should deprive him of the favors of all Marses, unto whom
he durst not have gone any more, if once she should have put him into despair,
could not consent unto her desires. Why, Sister, said he unto her, you see me
to be an hundred leagues from the Court, in a solitary Country, where one can
hardly behold any thing that so much as resembles a woman, and you will be so
cruel as to deprive me of a company, wherein I meet with four very amiable
ones; so as if it be true that the loss of one Mistress brings an unquietness
that cannot be ended but by Iron or Poison, what do you think will become of
me, when you shall have taken from me four at a time, which I love
passionately; and in a place where I can find no others? If I were at Paris, I
should comply with you herein, not only for four, but for thirty, being well
assured that I should repair this loss in a little time: But in the midst of a
desert to deprive me of four sole maids whom I can love, is so great an
inhumanitie, in the humor wherein I am, as if you consider it seriously you
must needs repent you of it. But, answered his Sister laughing, you do not
love them, for how can you share your self amongst so many? Not love them
(replied the Marquis) naughty Sister, come, you do not know me, if you believe
as you say; for it is most certain that I love them with all my soul; and that
in all my life I never found my self so constant, nor so amorous. And whereas
this maid could not very easily comprehend, how a man could love four at once,
and term himself constant: for to make her understand it, he told her, that by
a very extraordinary adventure he had no great affection ^or any of them in
particular, but meeting in these four persons separately, with that, which he
would have in one alone, he was so desperately in love therewith, as he was
never in such a passion before. He told her further, that ordinarily when he
found any thing that was amiable in a woman, he excused the defects which were
in her, and became in love with all her person; but that in this encounter,
through a caprichiousness of love, he was wounded in another sort. For, said he
seriously, it would be impossible for me, in the estate wherein my mind now is,
to love any of those maids single; and I am never more joyful than when I see
them all four together. I behold the whitness of the first; the look of the
second; I hear the voice of the third; and admire the gentleness of the last.
In conclusion, I am so satisfied with this manner of loving, that when I could,
by an unheard of miracle, take from those four maids all that does please me
in them, to make thereof a Masterpiece and a mervail, such as I may imagine,
yet should I rather choose to love them as I do. For if I should love but one
of them, I should be without consolation when she were in choler; whereas
contrariwise I am never altogether unhappy: if I have angered the fair one, the
brown one regards me favorably; and if I am out with the serious one, the
merry one comforts me with her jocund humor; and when it falls out, that I am
upon good terms with all the four, I have such delight as cannot be expressed.
One prepares a bracelet for me, another ties a band about my hat, a third gives
me powder and essences, whilst the fourth causes her picture to be drawn for
the love of me. In pursuance hereof, I sing a song that is agreeable to all
four, which each of them applies to their own particular for a mark of my
affection, and which they all commend with address and joy: and that which is
yet more worth than all these things, is, that this passion is so fair and so
extraordinary, as the end of it can never be unhappy. For when as I my self
would contribute to mine own ruin, it is impossible that ever I should arrive
to that unfortunate term, which for the most part finishes all loves, I mean
marriage. If I should love one of these maids, it may be that utterly losing
all reason against my custom, I should also mary her; but loving these four
sisters as I do, unless the Law should permit me to mary them all four, as the
Turks does, I am in no danger of being their husband. In this manner I shall
be always free, and always amorous; and the impossibility that there is for
them ever to be my wives, gives them a charm, which will make me love them
until I return again to the Court. Judge now after this, cruel sister,
whether you are to rob me of all my pleasures. You know, continued he, that I
do not cross yours, that I have never pressed you to hearken to the sighs of
Marse, more than was needful for my diversion, and not to constrain you to
marry him. I am so much a friend of liberty, that I cannot endure the least
violence, either in my self, or in another; and if you resist me never so
little more, I feel that I shall do what you would have me; but at the very
same instant I shall take Post to go seek out some new object for my passion,
without which I am not able to live. They were a long time yet pleasantly
disputing on either part concerning this matter; but at last the Marquis his
Sister, who would not lose so favorable an occasion to discover unto her
Brother the design which she had, gives him to understand, that during his
absence, a Gentleman of their Neighbors, extreme rich, of great courage, and
of much spirit, had fallen in love with her; and that he being to return from
the Army in a short space, she was afraid lest some mischief might fall out
betvveen him and Marse. It is not that I have any affection for him, said this
Maid, but I must confess to you, that I will never mary Marse, though I think
I could resolve to be the others Wife. Come, my dear Sister, ansvvered the
Marquis, do not disguise your thoughts; say that you are in love; that your
passion is violent, and with these charming words you shall obtain of me all
that you can desire; I will return to the Court eight days sooner than I
would have done, to leave you the liberty to use Marse as you please; but
when I go I will leave our Mother an absolute power to mary you according
to your own mind; for I am so glad to see that you are not insensible, that I
love you for it far more than I did. As they were thus talking, Marse arrives,
the Marquis hides himself against his Sisters will, gets out at a back-gate,
mounts on hors-back, and rides to Marses house, which was not far off, where
he finds those four fair Sisters, or to say better, his four Mistresses, all of
them more joviall than ordinary, for they had every one in particular some hope
to be the Marquis his Wife, by reason of the proposition their Brother had made
to them of it. They had also attired themselves extraordinarily, to give him
new wounds; for they knew well no day past without his visiting them. The
eldest had a garment on of green cloth-of-Silver, wh^reof the sleeves were tied
up with carnation-silver'd ribbon, and her hair with the same, which did not
misbecome a person fair-complexioned. The second had on a night attire of pure
white silver tinsell, which gave a kind of luster to her serious and modest
aspect; the third always glittering, was in a wastcoat of gridilyon satin,
set all over with silver oes; as for the youngest, though her garment was
plainer than the rest, yet was it the gallantest; her habit was nothing else
but silverd tiffany, imbroidered with flowers, lined with carnation taffata,
and her head was covered over with carnation and white feathers, which must
needs do well with a young person, whose hair was black, complexion clear and
lively, and eyes wonderfully sparkling. All these Sisters were much amazed in
themselves, at the care which each of them had taken on one and the same day,
in setting forth themselves as much as possibly they could; and the Marquis was
so surprised to see them all at once with such magnificence and jollity, that
he could not imagine what should be the cause of it; for commonly they observed
this order amongst themselves, that there was one always carelessly dressed, to
the end that each of them in their turn might show, both affected handsomness,
and handsome carelessness. But at length the Marquis accoasts them, divides his
complements and looks, commends them all four together, and without knowing
what was in their thoughts, does things which confirms them in their opinion.
He talks to them of love openly, swears that he is in such a passion for them,
as he was never in the like before; and whereas their minds were prepossessed,
they believe that it is an address of Court to speak overtly of these matters,
and to leave it to her, whom one loves, to apply it to her self. She whom he
beheld believed, that it was as much as to say, it is for you; and those whom
he did not behold, believed, that out of respect he durst not encounter their
eyes, in speaking of a thing which might make them blush; in fine, they were
all very well contented and very well satisfied. The Marquis, who did not love
to make unprofitable visits, demands new favors of them; he will have a
bracelet made of the hair of all four; they laugh at it at first; they refuse
him, or to say better, they make him the more earnest to entreat them for it;
and at last they grant it him, still in the thought, that it is a trick whereby
he will get the hair of her eh loves, without making show that it should be a
particular favor, or that she should have cause to be offended at it. This
promise was soon executed; the youngest of these maids being the most dextrous,
was she that plaited this hair together, and made a bracelet of it, where the
different color of their hair appeared all asunder. In laboring at this work,
she laughed in her sleeve, to think how her Sisters were beguiled, if they
believed that it was for them the Marquis had desired that which she was
making; and the rest, who thought they were more cunning, mocked at the
simplicity of their younger Sister, for taking such pains about a thing
wherein she had so small a share. And those several concealed opinions which
they all had, gave them so strong a disposition to laugh, as upon the least
pretext for it, they fell into it; finding too amidst their laughter occasion
to redouble it, each of them believing in their mind, that the rest would not
always laugh with so good a will when once the Marquis should declare himself.
As for him, who never lost time, after he had spoken to them all in general,
according to the French liberty, he spoke to them in particular; he singles out
one into a corner of the room, and there says gallantries to her; a little
after he talks with another at a window, which looks upon the garden, and
seeming to admire the beauty of the flowers, he praises that of her eyes; he
accompanies the youngest when she goes forth, and makes use of this occasion to
cajoll her. And when they walk in the garden, he sometimes draws one of them
also from the rest, that he may be able to speak two or three words to her in
private, or to kiss her hand. In the mean time, Marse, who had not received
such caresses at the Marquis his house, returns to his own, where he finds him
still to be; he does what he can to make him stay all night, but the Marquis,
who began to fear lest Marse should press him to explain himself, withstands
it, parts from this fair company, carries away the bracelet, and comes back to
his Sister, who was very melancholic. For it had happened, that her Lover
being returned, had surprised her talking with Marse; and whether he had
understood of his design, or that she had before acquainted him with it, they
had saluted one another very coldly, and had talked as men that took pleasure
to contradict each other. So that, said she to the Marquis, after she had
recounted unto him that which had befallen, I see the matter in a case to break
forth, and suddenly to produce some mischief, if we do not look to it in time.
No such thing, answered the Marquis, for whereas I have promised nothing to
Marse, and that he too has not spoken to me of his love to you, or of any
purpose he had to marry you; I may tell him if he moves me about it, that I am
engaged to another, and to make that true, cause your Lover to come to me, and
I will promise him my consent. I know that thereby I shall banish my self from
a place, where I have a great deal of pleasure; but since I am of necessity to
be gone away within eight days to the Court, I could not make a better end of
this adventure. For Marse forbidding me his house, I shall have a fair occasion
to write them a letter of adieu and despair: withal, continued he, I perceive
that I begin to accustom my self to the favors which I receive from these
Gentlewomen, so that now the happiness which love gives me, being turned into
an habit, it is no longer hapiness to me. The Marquis his Sister was so
astonished to hear him talk thus, as she could not forbear laughing at it: They
past the evening in this sort, and not to lose time, the Marquis his Sister
advertised her Lover, that the next morning he should repair to her Brother to
acquaint him clearly with the intentions he had for her. The note which she
sent failed not to work the effect she expected from it; her Lover comes just
as the Marquis is rising, speaks to him of his passion for his Sister, shows
that he covets his alliance, and in the end expresses his desires so clearly,
that the Marquis without further delay leads him to his Mothers chamber, who
favored her Daughters wishes, propounds the matter unto her, gets her to agree
unto it; and whereas this Lover was absolute Master of his Estate, and of his
own will, they resolved to accomplish this Marriage within four days, to the
end that the Marquis, who was to return to the Court, might be at his sisters
wedding. Things being in these terms, Marse arrives, who was come on purpose
to his Mistresses Mother, to discover his design unto her. As soon as the
Marquis saw him enter, he descends, he goes and embraces him, invites him to
his sisters wedding, before he acquaints him to whom she is to be married;
seems to believe that he is not interessed therein; talks to him of dancing
and joy; hoping thereby, that Marse, seeing the matter resolved, would not
explain himself further, and peradventure would alter his mind. As indeed,
Marse hearing this discourse, and knowing that his rival was returned, makes
no doubt but the Marquis spoke the truth, only he doubted, in regard of the
manner of the Marquis his speech to him, whether he had observed that he
affected his sister. He was mad that he had not declared himself sooner, and
that he was arrived so late; and in this unquietness, he knew not whether he
should go in or no, to be the spectator of his Rivals triumph; whether he
should quarrel with the Marquis, though he knew not as yet that he was faulty;
whether he should depart away without saying any thing unto him; or whether he
should trouble this wedding with some strange violence; in fine he was so
confounded, as not knowing what to do in so unpleasing a conjuncture, he
suffered himself to be conducted along by the Marquis, whose adress in this
occasion was such, as without seeming to perceive any change in his
countenance, he still continued talking to him of diversion and joy: and that
too with embracing and putting him gently on toward his Mothers chamber;
whereunto as soon as ever they were entered, the Marquis presented his
brother-in-law to Marse, who saluted him very coldly; in the mean time he had
leisure to tell his Mother and his sister in two words, that to keep Marse from
showing his hatred and resentment, he was not to be left alone with any body.
After that civilities were rendered on either part, the Marquis thought it was
fittting that he should entertain the company; he began then to quarrel with
his sister, for that she was the cause of his rejoicing at a thing which was
repugnant to his mind; but withal he was well assured, that this thing should
never give him joy again, either for her, or any other, and that this
compliance was no doubt the greatest mark he could render her of his love.
Marse hearing this discourse, demanded of him, whether he meant marriage by that
which he spoke? and the Marquis without further delay, answered him laughing,
that it was of that destroyer of love; of that Tyrant of liberty; of that
enemy of pleasure; which most commonly disjoynes all that Love has united;
which discovers all the defects of the mind and humor, to persons that believed
they were altogether perfect; and that which was worse than all the rest for
him, which banishes love, inconstancy, and gallantry from amongst men, to
introduce into the stead of it, jealousy of honor, a false constancy, and
domestic cares. So that, as you speak (replied Marse interrupting him) you
believe it may be that you should much oblige one of your friends, if you
should mary his Mistress to another. If he should tell me, answered the
Marquis, that he would mary her, I should not contradict his intent, for I am
so much an enemy to constraint, as I never oppose any thing; but otherwise if
a worthy man of my friends should appear to me extremely amorous, I do not
think I should do him any great wrong, if I should deprive him of the means
of marying his Mistress, in case his passion should disorder him so far, as to
give him a desire to do so: And in the humor that I am, the greatest proof of
affection that I can render unto a maid, when I become inamoured of her, is,
not to marry her: yea, and I have met with some, unto whom, the more favorably
to receive my affection, and to testify unto them the respect which I bare
them, I have declared at the first sight, that in becoming their Servant, I had
no design to become their Master; and in assuring them that I was their slave,
I assured them that I would never be their Tyrant. It may be, replied Marse,
you have not always spoken so openly; that I have not, answered the Marquis,
when I believed, that those whom I loved had wit enough not to suspect that I
had any such bad intent; but howsoever I have never done or said any thing
which could make them believe, that I had any other aim, than to love them, to
be kindly received of them, to be heard with pleasure, and to obtain of them
all those petty favors, which are no part of the Husbands demean, and which
ought always to remain in the disposition of Ladies, therewith to gratify
their Lovers. For since there are not men found, which amuse themselves in
wearing bracelets of their wives hair; which demand favors of them; which are
ravished with kissing only the tip of their gloves; with saying gallantries to
them, praising their beauties, giving them serenades; making verses to their
glory; and telling them that they burn and dye for love of them. Is it not
strange they should be deprived of all these pleasures? and is it not unjust,
that men which do not love them should possess them absolutely? and that they
which adore them should not at leastwise have all those petty things, which are
not directly opposite to virtue? Your maxims are so bad, said the Marquis his
Sister, speaking to her Brother, that if you had not always been at Court, and
that we had always been brought up together, I should have some cause to fear,
that one might imagine you had persuaded me to your opinion. I dare not say,
replied her Lover, that these maxims, which you condemn, have nothing in them
that clashes with reason; nor also maintain that they have nothing in them but
that which is bad; for I have too much love for the Sister, and too much
respect for the Brother; but howsoever I am confident that you will not follow
them. It is true, said Marse, tartly enough, that inconstancy is not that
wherewith he is to be reproched; and I know not whether on the contrary, Virtue
opposed will not prove to be the only crime that may be imputed to him. The
Marquis perceiving that the other was preparing himself to answer, and
peradventure with bitterness, continued to speak of the injustice of men in the
discerning of things. For, said he, if the diversity of good books renders a
man knowing; if diversity of voyages serves him for an agreeable study, which
illuminates his mind, and informs his judgment; if the diversity of fair arts
is a knowledge that pleases; if the diversity of tongues passes for a laudable
curiosity, why should one think that the diversity of loves can produce nothing
that is good? And why will one have the grace of novelty, which is the charm of
nature, to be a defect in love? For my part, said Marse, I will no longer
oppose this doctrine, since an universal change cannot be but advantageous for
me, glorious for some, and equitable for others. The hidden sense of this
speech was easily understood by all the company; but the Marquis, who in this
occasion did not desire to dive into things, altered the discourse, and said
unto Marse, that his Sisters must needs honor this Wedding with their
presence, and that he must rejoice with them, for that they are not so near to
slavery. The honor that you will do them, answered Marse, will surprise them,
not because your civilities has not given them occasion to attend more from
you, but whereas this news is unexpected, it is fit that I should go and
advertise them of it, to the end they may prepare themselves to receive the
grace that you will do them. The Marquis pressed him extremely to pass away
the rest of the day with them, but he would by no means stay; He invites him
also to his Sisters Wedding, talks to him of Bals, Lutes, Music, and of all
the entertainments usual in such like Feasts: whereunto the other answered
still with speeches of a double sense. The two Rivals quipt one another
civilly, which doubtless might have produced some unlucky adventure, had not
the merry humor of the Marquis sweetened the conversation. Marse took his leave
of the company, with a forced countenance, which made them conceive that he had
strange unquietness in his mind. He went home then with so much grief, as he
could not longer conceal it, and to minish it in some sort he desired to make
his Sisters partakers of it. He sends for them, acquaints them with the marriage
of his Mistress, tells them that the Marquis is unfaithful, inconstant, a
cheater, a courtier; that cares for nothing but to please himself; that has
made a mockery of them; and then recounts all their conversation unto them.
These four Sisters were not more amazed at this Wedding whereunto they were
invited, and the lightness of the Marquis his humor, than to know by their
Brothers discourse that they were Rivals, and equally beguiled of the hopes
which they had conceived. At first they beheld one another, as if they would
silently reproach each other for concealing themselves in their designs: But
the third of these maids, whose mind was not so sensible of grief, and that
could not be long without giving some marks of her humor, after she had paused
a little, began to speak, and said with a tone of the voice of admiration, I
must confess the Marquis is wonderful dextrous, that could deceive four
interessed maids; and though I did infinitely esteem him, continued she, I did
not think he had had so much wit, nor that he was so unworthy of my friendship.
The minds of the three others were not so moderate; and though the eldest was
of a very sweet disposition, yet could she not choose but show her resentment.
The second, always haughty, manifested hers, by seeming to share very much in
that of her brother; but as for the youngest, she was vexed to the heart, for
having so ill assured her first conquest; and albeit she had a great deal of
wit, yet she could not forbear showing her choler. Howsoever the third
continued still saying, that this adventure was a new charm, which she
discovered in the Marquis, and that engaged her to esteem of him the more. In
the mean time the wedding day arrives; Marse feignes himself sick because he
would not be at it; the sisters excuse themselves upon their brothers sickness:
Howbeit the third makes a secret match with one of her kinswomen, that dwells
not far of, to go and see this feast in disguise; they mask themselves then
very bravely, and appear in that assembly accompanied with certain men
disguised too as they were. As soon as they were entered into the rooom, the
Marquis knew her that touched his heart still; he approaches to her, makes her
an hundred complements, and continues telling her, that he loves her
passionately. But she without reproaching him, answers, that she does not doubt
of it, and that the conformity which is between them ought to work so fair an
effect. That nevertheless it was fit they should a little better examine their
thoughts, it seeming just unto her, that two persons, which made profession of
beguiling all the world in gallantery, should not be beguiled between
themselves. This said, this gentlewoman made the Marquis sit down by her,
whilst the rest of the company were dancing, and with a most pleasing relation
acquainted him with all that had past, betwixt her brother, her sisters, and
her self. Hereupon they promised much good will one to another, esteeming too
much of themselves for ever speaking together again of love. She counseled the
Marquis not to come at their house, but since he was to be gone to the Court
the day following to send a complement to her brother and her sisters, as
indeeed he did. The Marquis took post the next morning, leaving his sister very
well contented, Marse in despair, three of his sisters in cholerenough. and the
other satisfied. Ever since that, Madam, there has always been a secret hate
between these two houses, until such time as Marse made the report that caused
the cmobat, which I have recounted unto you, and that consequently has so
happily for us brought the Marquis into Italy. I confess, said the Princess,
that the history has much delighted me; and that I am much obliged unto you
for acquainting me with so gallant and extraordinary a man. As she was saying
so, the Marquis came into the chamber again; whereupon she began to charge him
for keeping so long away from a company, which found his infinitely agreeable to
them: But he with a respective boldness, answered, that knowing very well how
the Count would impart some part of his humor unto her, he feared not to
acknowledge, that being in doubt he should not always well remember what she
was, and also what he was, he went away to expose himself to the looks of
the fair Aemilia, to the end that having his heart replenished with love, he
might have nothing but veneration for her. Isabella could not forbear laughing
though she blushed in looking on Justiniano: who told the Princess, that this
foresight and respect of his, merited a great deal of acknovvledgment. And I
too am resolved not to be ungrateful; but I fear when as you know me, said
she to the Marquis, that you will have a passion for me quite contrary to that
which you seem to fear. For in fine, whether it be constancy or obstinacy, I
never change my determination; when once I have taken a resolution, nothing
can destroy it; so as I have great cause to doubt, that this difference of
humors which is seen betwixt us, will set me at ods with you: but that which
gives me a little hope yet, is, that I know you have friends that are not
inconstant. I confess, Madam, replied the Marquis, that I am inconstant, and
that following the order of Nature, I should hate that which is directly
opposite to me; but for all that it is certain, that I am not incommodiously
inconstant; I never contradict any in their opinions, nor in their pleasures; I
give unto others the liberty which I desire they should grant me; I do not
blame constancy, though I like well of change; and my soul is so full of
passion, as I cannot condemn all that which is called Love; wheresoever I find
this passion, it pleases me, and all the effects of it are agreeable unto me.
I love jealousy in this same, despair in him, dissimulation in some,
infidelity in others; and although it seldom produces any thing but joy in me,
yet does not the melancholy of a Lover, who is not of my humor, offend me. I
am so powerfully persuaded of the excellency of Love, as I hold for infallible,
that the most unfortunate Lover in the World has more happy days, than the
freest of all men can have. For in fine, the remembrance of what is past, or
the hope of what is to come, still gives him fe^icities, which are not met
withal in the possession of other good things. Verily, said the Princess,
there was never any one so sociably inconstant; for commonly we are so unjust,
as to desire that our sense should rule that of others, to approve of nothing
but what pleases us, and to condemn all that contradicts our opinions. And
they which are of this humor, find in themselves wherewith to maintain their
severity. They say, that whereas there is but one reason in all things, there
is but one way to be followed; that all they which esloign themselves from
that, do go astray, and that so they may be justly blamed. I acknowledge,
Madam, replied the Marquis, that there is but one reason, but I maintain also,
that it is so difficult to be known, as he who thinks he has found it, is
oftentimes further from it than others, which without judging sovereignty of
any thing simply, follow the sense wherewith Nature has inspired them. And
indeed to speak truth, if it be necessary for the equitable judging of a
matter, that one should be loose from all, and so indifferent as to lean
equally to each side, or to say better, not to lean to either; how is it
possible that any man should be so hardy as to make any judgment of the actions
of others, principally of that which regards Love? But since I have been taken
at Genoua for an Astrologer, permit me to play the cunning man in this
encounter; I say then, Madam, that our reason is not so absolutely loosed from
sense, but that our temperament has a great share in our opinions; and that
that just mixture of the four humors, which renders the spirit so clear and
solid, and our health so sound, is seldom found in any body. There is always
one of them that predominates over the rest, and by it we act according to the
pleasure thereof; we are grave, merry, choleric, or patient; insensible, or
passionate. And certainly it is not so much the rigor of a melancholic man's
Mistress, that makes him cry out, sigh every minute, shed tears, pass away
nights without sleep, rave from the purpose, talk always of despair, and
appear with a langor, that seems to be an effect of an extreme affliction; as
the power of this predominant humor, which forces him to receive all things
after this sort. And to prove that which I say, we are but to consider, that if
the same rigor were addressed to a man of my humor, he would receive it in
another fashion; the jollity and joy which proceeds from the temperament, is
not easily troubled by things without; and certainly, that which makes the
melancholic man complain in Love, would give me occasion to laugh; that which
makes him to sigh, would induce me to make verses of gallantery; that which
makes him weep, would quite cure me of my passion; and if I should pass nights
without sleep, it would be, doubtless, to give Serenades; I should not rave in
conversing, to weary others, and make them hate me; I should not entertain my
Mistress with my despair; nor should I fill her imagination with sad thoughts,
which putting her into a bad humor, might make her to use me ill afterward.
But contrarily, I would talk to her still of all the delights of them that love
one another; and whereas Love is always represented in the midst of sports,
laughters, and pleasures, I would endeavor to inspire her heart with joy, that
so I might the more easily introduce love into it, to whom the painters do
always give a bed of flowers, without ever laying him on thorns. In fine,
Madam, far from persuading my passion unto her by the langor of my face, I
would show her so much satisfaction in my eyes, as she might very well perceive
that her dominion would be pleasing to me; and that I would not be like those
people newly conquered, who by their melancholy makes one believe that they are
always meditating some revolt. There are also two kinds of Lovers, who by the
humors which predominate in them are made to do strange things, the anxious,
and the choleric. And though the former are not so far eloigned from the
melancholic, but that they have some conformity together; nor the choleric
from that sparkling humor, and that fire which animates me; yet are they for
all that differing in many things. The anxious is satisfied with nothing; the
possession of felicities, which he has desired, molest him; he wishes for
quite contrary things; he loves and hates all at a time; he has a secret enemy
within himself, that mingles bitterness with all his pleasures; he believes
when his Mistress shows him favors, that she is too prodigal of them, or
that she deceives him; in conclusion he is easily displeased; nothing can
content him; and when the person whom he loves gives him the least cause of
jealousy, it is enough for him to meditate on a murder. A man like me, in
such a like occasion, would mock at his Mistress, and his Rival; a
melancholic man in France would fight very courageously, but as for an anxious
man, Steel, Iron, and poison, would be the least arms that he would make use
of. As for the choleric, he would receive the rigors of his Mistress with
transports of fury, so far forth as to offer affronts to her, to threaten her
with all things; but as the clouds, which form the tempests, are dissolved
when thunder breaks forth, so this man of choler has no sooner exhaled his
fire by his cries, but he goes out of himself, and one only look of the person
beloved finding yet some impression of heat in his heart, does therein easily
kindle that again of love; Finally he is easily angered, and is as soon
appeased. There are yet of another temperament, who are so patient, as they are
almost insensible; and cold predominates so much in them, as if it arrives that
love warmes them a little, they are capable of enduring any thing: For they are
so powerfully surmounted by laziness, that for fear of stiring they dare not
change their Mistress, but suffer all things without complaining. You see then,
Madam, that the diversity of the humors of the body contributes much to our
apprehensions; and that one and the same thing is seen after a quite different
manner. And if we will give credit to the Astrologers in this behalf, they will
tell you also, that Saturn by his influence makes all the melancholicks act, as
I have declared; that they, over whom Jupiter predominates, are of my humor;
that Mars inflames the souls of those, whom he governes, with the fire of
choler; and that the Moon inspires those, whom she commands, with a coldness,
which makes them almost insensible. You will tell me it may be, Madam, that
these Stars are so far distant from us, as it is hard to comprehend how they
exercise an absolute power upon men; but if you consider that which they do in
the universal world, you will the more easily believe that which they do
particularly in man: for in fine the diversity of seasons is derived from
them; and this successive change of heat and cold, of flowers and fruits,
which are seen every year, is found also in our selves. We have our seasons as
well as the year, and even as age changes our temperament, in changing our
humors, we likewise change opinions. The second age of life, which is the
first for love, seldom fayles in producing of violent passions, which are often
followed by imprudence and indiscretion. As for the third, the passions therein
are not so lively, but withal they are better governed: One conceales the
pictures which he has of his Mistress; One no longer shows the bracelets of
hair which she gives; One has as much care of her conservation as of his
pleasure; and it is in this age alone, where gallantry, a little reason, and a
great deal of love, may sometimes be encountered all together. But for that
which follows, and is called the age of Wisdom, Love does in it appear so
strange, so dreadful, and so ridiculous, as I cannot find any thing more
horrible than an amorous old man. For of all the apprehensions which this
passion inspires him with, he has none left him but jealousy: Liberality,
Address, Gracefulness, Vivacity of Spirit, that fire which sparkles in the eyes
of a Lover, Respect, Care, Cajolleries, Verses, Music, Dancing, and an hundred
other things, which are so dependent on Love, that if it be dispoiled of these
ornaments, it almost ceases to be Love; all these things (I say) are no longer
found save in his memory, and that too in a manner, which time and use has
rendered ridiculous. But instead of all that, he is covetous, uncomely, of a
languishing spirit, dis-respectfull, careless, incapable of delivering a
civility with any good grace, or of making Verses that have any life in them;
for the Muses do not use to favor old Lovers: And for the language of the
Eyes, how should they make use of them to express their passion, when as
ordinarily they are become so weak, or sunk so far into their heads with age,
as they are hardly to be seen, neither can they distinctly see others. Finally,
that Love which is painted so plump to us, so fair, so jolly, so amiable, so
merry, so young, so vigorous, a torch in one hand, a bow and quiver on his
shoulder, and a scarf over his eyes, should for them be painted, withered,
lean, hideous, hoary, sad, and languishing, having neither bow, nor quiver, nor
making other use of an extinguished torch but to lean on it, nor of his scarf
but to wipe his eyes. So that, Madam, this diversity, which is seen to arrive
to one and the same person, according to the change of his humors, of his
temperament, and of his ages, does demonstrate, that albeit there is but one
reason to be followed, yet we do oftentimes form many according to our fancy.
Wherefore I do not think I am upon a bad ground, in not amusing my self about
so vain a search, as that of the true reason of all things, seeing it is so
difficult to find; nor in following, as I do, that which pleases me, and all
that which seems amiable to me; neither in leaving that liberty to others,
which I give unto my self.

After the Marquis had given over speaking, and left the company very much
satisfied with his wit, Justiniano, who would not abandon reasons party, and
who desired the Princess should think it was not out of caprichiousness and
fancy that he had veneration for her, answered the Marquis in this sort. You
combat reason with so much force and address, as it cannot be easily believed
that you do not know her; and the same wit which you have made use of to
overthrow her dominion, manifests sufficiently unto us that you are one of her
subjects; and if at any time you quit her, it is only in this passion, from
whence some, who are not acquainted with the nobleness of Love, would banish
her. But for all that it is certain, that she finds a place every where; that
she can be the Mistress of all m^n; that she can subdue all the passions, and
all the griefs of the mind; make those of the body to be supported without
impatience; withstand our temperament, and the influences of the Stars; and by
her infinite force makes us vanquish our selves, by obliging us oftentimes to
destroy our own pleasures.

To know this truth, we are but to consider, that the humors which predominate
in us, the constellation of the Stars, and that change which time works in our
temperament, do not change any thing but our inclinations, which certainly are
caused by all these things: Howbeit that is not powerful enough to delude
reason, who no way depending either on the melancholy humor, or on the Stars,
can also judge soveraignly of all the apprehensions wherewith she inspires us.
She has a seat more transcendent than our inclinations, which many times are
found to be very low, and corrected by reason. All Antiquity would furnish us
with examples of it, and the wisest have left us marks of owing all their
virtue to their reason, which having made them prefer the study of Philosophy
before their inclinations, has kept them from being the most infamous amongst
men. And truly, it were to deprive us of all the advantages which we have over
beasts, if our only inclinations should have the conduct of our lives: And to
make it appear that we have a destiny more noble than that same, we are but to
observe, that the Creatures, which move not but by instinct, have one like unto
it, and general to all their kind. All Hearts seek dictamum when they are hurt;
all Birds of season seek for the Springtime, and fly from the Winter without
failing; which the Lions do not, nor so many Birds that do not shift Country.
This instinct then is seen in all the creatures without ever failing, even as
the race of the Sun, the course of the Rivers, and all other things which do
not depend of themselves, do always follow the first order that has been
given them, and that is so ne-necessary to them, as they cannot fail. But as
for man, it is not so with him; he is absolute Master of his thoughts, and of
his actions; nothing forces him, nothing violents him, and he is so independent
from all things, as he can even attempt upon his own life, as was often seen at
such time as it was lawful to prefer death before servitude. It cannot be said
that this action, which destroys Nature, is an effect of a natural
inclination; there must be then a more powerful reason than our inclinations,
seeing it is certain, that of all the interior apprehensions which Nature
gives us, there is none so strong, so predominant, nor so universal, as the
desire of life. In the mean time, since there have been men found able to
vanquish it by reason, it may be consequently believed, that there are a great
number of others, who can force their inclinations, and judge soundly of all;
and who, without considering that which pleases them, consider only that which
ought to please them. For in conclusion, our inclinations do not move in us so
powerfully as one may imagine they do; they having nothing common, as I have
already said, with this instinct of unreasonable creatures, which forces a
whole kind to do one and the same thing, and which is instead of reason to
them; since we see, that not only all Nations, all Provinces, but all men in
particular, are so different one from another, that many times there is more
difference between an Italian and an Italian, than between the whole Nation,
and that of the Persians and Tartarians. Our inclinations, if we will know them
well, are no other than a secret motion, that carries us without violence to
please our selves more with one thing than another; some love the Woods better
than the Rivers; and others the Waters better than the Forests, and that may
be peradventure by temperament; they leave not both of them for all that to
know, maugre their inclinations, the beauty of those things, and to delight in
them, which do not touch their minds the most sensibly. But to show that it is
somewhat too weak a thing to deceive reason, we are but to consider, that use
alone forces our inclinations. Liberty, which is so natural to all the World,
is a good that is not desired by all the women of Italy; custom only makes
them find their houses large enough for their walks; and the place of their
devotions far enough for their voyages. Judge then after this, whether reason
can suffer her self to be vanquished by enemies which time does surmount. As
for the passions, I confess, that they are a little more difficult to be
destroyed; but yet I maintain, that if reason will oppose them, she will
appease them, and restore tranquillity to the mind that is most troubled. If
reason then will act, it is certain, that, maugre the force of temperament, the
influences of the Stars, and the ages of men, we shall see the melancholic
sociable; the choleric patient; the slothful more active; a young Lover
without inconstancy, and without indiscretion. I acknowledge nevertheless,
that there is a kind of passion, or to express my self more clearly, a kind of
Love, which reason cannot destroy. This impotence proceeds not, for all that,
from her weakness, but it is because she never destroys that which she has
established; and because this Love, whereof I speak, is rather an effect of our
reason, than of our passion; and truly, when a Lover has, in the person whom
he loves, met with the beauty of the body, of the mind, and of the soul; when
as Virtue is mingled with all these charms; when as his vows are not rejected;
when as he fears but the inconstancy of Fortune, and not that of his
Mistress, it is impossible to say otherwise than that reason is the Mother of a
passion, that doubtless cannot disorder the mind; that has nothing base,
nothing abject; that produces none but fair thoughts; that propounds no
recompense unto it self; and that has no other aim but to love eternally. If I
were of a humor to contradict the opinions of others (answered the Marquis,
laughing, and looking on Justiniano, and then on Isabella) I could show you in
few words, that at the very same instant when as you maintain, that one cannot
be pre-occupated by his inclinations, you do not consult so much with your
reason, as with your sense: But let it suffice for the finishing of our
dispute, that I will make you see by my experience, that my inclinations shall
be always stronger than my reason; and not to stay longer in giving you an
example of it, know, that though I am by the most perfect Princess in the
World, and in the conversation of the worthiest persons of Italy, yet can I not
choose but be in some unquietness for that I do not see the beautiful Aemilia.
The whole company could not forbear laughing at the freedom of the Marquis;
and the Princess demanded of him, whether he had yet taught her Kinswoman the
French liberty, by having persuaded her to receive his visits without her
permission. Madam, said he unto her, if any one be faulty in this occasion, it
can be none but I; who going out of your chamber for the reason which I have
declared unto you, I took the boldness to make use of your name, to be received
into that of Aemilia, from whence I had not departed as yet if she had not
driven me away. Justiniano seeing it grow late, wished the Count to bid the
Princess goodnight, for fear of incommodating her, by making her stay up too
long; and though she made them a complemen^ to assure them that they could
never be troublesome unto her, yet they retired, and were conducted by the
principal Officers of her House to their Lodgings. The Marquis would not
abandon the Count, nor Doria, his dear Justiniano, who nevertheless could have
been well contented to have been alone for the better entertaining of his
thoughts, but civility and friendship kept him from it. When as they were abed,
Doria, who could conceal nothing from his friend, acquainted him, that Horatio,
of the illustrious House of Cibo, and the Count's Brother-in-Law, was in love
with his Sister; and that he almost was so too with the Count's Sister-in-Law,
although he had seen her but twice since his return: Howbeit that he had used
his best endeavor to oppose this passion, in regard he knew very well that
this Maid had an imperious humor, which would not be easily vanquished.
Justiniano answered thereunto in such a manner, as persuaded Doria that he had
a mind to sleep, but indeed it was because his mind was so taken up with his
own, as he was not capable of hearkening to other men's affairs; so that Doria
fearing to incommodate him, gave over talking, and slept more quietly than
Justiniano did.

IBRAHIM: OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The second part. The second BOOK.
THe morning bringing joy and delight again to this fair Troop, the Princess
would needs have the Count and the Marquis bestow that whole day too upon her,
and to pass it away the more agreeably she led them to Monton, a little Town,
some mile from Monaco, where the Princes of her House had built a magnificent
Paviglion, which she desired to show unto the Marquis. Aemilia finding her self
better that night, made one also of the company, so that the Marquis was in the
best humor of the World. And whereas the Princess observed that his respects
were not displeasing to her kinswoman, she said to the Marquis, for to oblige
him to talk, that whereas love ought to be without supercherie as well as war,
he having not as yet declared himself to be Aemilia's, she might by his
observance and services be induced to believe that he was capable of a solid
affection, and so engage her further than was fitting. Aemilia blushed at this
discourse, and the Marquis without giving her leave to speak, assured the
Princess, that he should not long conceal himself, and that the Count could
confirm this truth unto her. Indeed, said the Count, he has not used to keep
himself from being known, and if he would take the pains to recount unto you
the first adventure that befell him at Genoua, his address would appear to the
beautiful Aemilia, and the relation no doubt would give your Excellency much
content. Withal it will be better walking toward the evening, than in the
midst of the day, and you cannot pass it away better. The Princess, who was
persuaded, that the Marquis his adventures could not choose but be very
pleasant, entreated him thereunto with a great deal of civilitie; he excuses
himself a while, but in the end she conjures him to it in the name of his last
Mistress; It is she indeed, answered he, that is most powerful in my heart,
and that makes me to obey. The Princess conducted them then into a Cabinet,
that was open on four sides, and whereof all the walls were of cristall glass
from the top to the bottom, that so the prospect might be the more free. After
they were set down there on seats of ebony, covered with carnation and silver
tinsell, the Marquis began his History in this sort.

The History of the feigned Astrologer.
BEfore I begin the relation which I am going to make, remember, Madam, though
I speak your language as if I were an Italian, that I am for all that a
French-mam, that is to say, an enemy of the coldness, and reservedness of your
Nation; That it is I who have reconciled virtue and galanterie at Genoua; who
have declared my self the protector of the liberty of you Ladies; and who in
conclusion have by my care and address deserved amongst them the glorious title
of their Deliverer. I tell you all these things, that you may not think it
strange, if in the sequel of this discourse you understand some adventures,
where the civility of this side the mountains is not regularly observed. I
know, answered the Princess, all that you have done for the public liberty;
the Count has already acquainted me, that the galanterie, which is seen now at
Genoua, is an effect of yours; and that in the end you have been so powerful
in persuading the virtue of women, as there is scarce any brother or husband
that is longer jealous. I am not sorry, replied the Marquis, that so worthy a
man has drawn you my picture, for though I doubt not but that he has
somewhat flattered me, yet you will not choose but know me. In the mean time
since I must satisfy your curiosity, it is necessary that I give you to
understand, how as soon as I was arrived at Genoua, with a design to stay there
so long as my humor should find wherewithal to entertain it self, I observed,
that near to the lodging where I lay, there was a maid, who seemed beautiful
enough unto me, as indeed it must be acknowledged, that Livia has something,
that is very bewitching, in the air of her face, especially for a man that is
not melancholic; and that she has a kind of I know not what cast with her
eyes, which persuaded me she would not be very cruel. If I were known more
particularly of you than I am, I would not tell you, Madam, that I loved Livia,
since it would be enough to make you comprehend it, that I say to you she
seemed fair unto me. In fine, she had no sooner made an impression in my heart,
but I sought the means to touch hers. And although it be my custom to explain
my self clearly in matter of love, and never to leave her, whom I serve, to
devine of my passion, yet in regard I durst not yet publish my precepts openly,
it is true that I continued a whole week together in using all the fantastical
tricks of a Lover of this Country. I passed twenty times a day before her door;
I followed her in the streets; I accompanied her in her devotions; I saluted
her with respect; I beheld her a far off with languishing eyes; I went every
evening to make a noise under her windows with a Gittern; and according to the
fashion I employed the very address of my horse to let her see mine, in making
him curvet an hundred times before her lodging; In fine, I omitted none of
those fooleries, which are introduced amongst you. But whereas I advanced my
design very little by so long a way, and perceived apprehensions of curiosity
in Livia, but none at all of love (at leastwise as I could judge by the manner
of he^ beholding me) I began to accuse her of stupiditie, or ingratitude, and
to think of a retreat. But coming suddenly again out of this error, I resolved
not to quit her, until I had served her some time after the fashion of France;
or at least used the means so to do. For, said I, am not I unjust in desiring
she should love me, because I pass oftentimes thorough a street where I do
lodge as well as she? In desiring that she should be obliged unto me, because I
take pleasure in looking on her for that she is fair? In desiring too that she
should recompense me, because I hinder her from sleeping some nights, with a
bad harmony? And lastly, would I have her judge of my wit and love, by the
address of my horse? No, said I, I must write to her, I must talk with her, I
must make verses for her, I must entertain her with her beauty and my love, and
after I have showed her all the gallanterie of our Nation, if she be still
rebellious to my desires, let me quit her without much pain, and comfort my
self easily enough after it. And the better to bring my purpose to pass, I had
recourse to the address of a servant of mine that waits on me in my chamber,
who certainly is incomparable for intricate businesses. After I had propounded
unto him that which I desired, he assured me that within few days he would
furnish me at the least with means to write unto Livia, as indeed he failed
not to do. For it had fallen out that Livia had a maid, which served her,
called Lucretia, to whom la Roche (for so is my Agent in love named) had taken
a liking, and she, through a sympathy of humors, as I learned afterward, had
not beheld him with indifferency. It was then by this way that I wrote to
Livia, for after that la Roche had understood my intentions he had redoubled
his addresses to Lucretia, and for the advancing of my affairs, I had given
him wherewithal to be liberal; so that he got this wench to promise that she
would show my letters, and some verses, wherein I had painted forth my love, to
her Mistress; but though I had employed all my skill therein, yet could I not
obtain any answer. Lucretia indeed told la Roche, that Livia esteemed very much
of me, that my wit pleased her, that my conversation was agreeable unto her
(for I had talked with her twice at the window by the means of Lucretia) but
that after all I was not to pretend to her affection. I confess that for this
time her resistance provoked me more than her beauty. Behold me then resolved
to know from whence the impossibility of my enterprise proceeded; I call la
Roche to my succor, and command him to repair to Lucretia, and to employ all
his cunning to discover Liviaes true thoughts. He presses her, he intreates
her, he threatens to abandon her, and yet for all that she acquaints him with
no part of that he desires to understand. At first she tells him, that she
knows nothing; afterward, that she is obliged to be faithful to her
Mistress; then, that it is a thing past remedy; and last of all, without any
thought of telling him that which he required, she says that Livia is engaged
in an affection to another, whom she will not name. This news put me into
choler, and made me resolve once more to tempt the fidelity of Lucretia; to
which effect I gave la Roche a diamond, therewith to oblige this wench to meet
him one evening, and discover unto him the whole truth of Liviaes history. My
liberality failed not to persuade her better than his eloquence, she meets
him in a place far enough out of the way to be overheard of any but my self,
who understood what she said without her perceiving it; and there, after she
had suffered her self to be a little entreated, she spoke in this sort unto
him. I know very well that I commit a strange infidelity against my Mistress,
but since it is to conserve you, and that you promise me you will not speak of
it, I hope I shall not repent me. I will tell you then, continued she, that
about three days ago, when as my Mistress was making an end of dressing her,
and that she was doing something about her head, where she had no need of me,
she observed that I looked out at the window with a great deal of attention,
and that I had also pulled up the grate. And whereas she asked of me what it
was I looked at so earnestly, I answered her boldly, that it was at the
worthiest man of all her lovers; meaning your Master, who then passed along
thorough the street. I fear me, replied she sighing, that you and I are not of
the same opinion; howbeit, Lucretia, who is he that you do treat so
advantagiously to the prejudice of others? It is, said I being become more
hardy, the French Marquis, who verily has an air, and a countenance, which
none of the rest have. And for my part, I confess unto you, that I should be
more sensible for a man of his Nation, than of ours. I cannot tell, Lucretia,
answered she, whether I should have been as sensibly touched as thee, if he of
whom thou speak had found my heart without engagement, but this I can tell,
my dear girl, that it is not in an estate to receive any new impression, for
the truth is, I am in love. Are you in love, said I mightily surprised? I, said
she, I am in love, and that so exceedingly, as I am resolved to tell him so
much this day, who is the cause of my passion; and who after my ill entreating
of him for two years together, is resolved to return unto Naples, of whence he
is, and never to come to Genoua again. But I do not purpose to be so virtuous,
as to be thereby unfortunate all the rest of my life, wherefore, my dear
Lucretia, thou must this night, when as he is to come and take his leave of me,
bring him into the garden at such time as my father is asleep, where I will be
ready to receive him; for I cannot endure he should go from me. He is of a
condition equal to mine, so that the greatest harm can arrive to me by it, is
to mary him whether my father will or no, who peradventure will make some
difficulty of it, because he is not so rich as I; howsoever, Lucretia, do as I
have bid thee, and be assured that I will make thee happy, if thou prove
faithful to me. As I was preparing to answer, her father came into the
chambsr. In the mean time night arrived, and whereas I could do no other but
obey her, I brought in Hortensio the Neapolitan, who was received by Livia with
a great deal of joy; and for a conclusion of this interview, it fell out, that
after he was come to complain of her rigor, and to take his last farewell of
her, he returned more beloved than he loved. But that the World might not think
it strange that he went not away after he had taken his leave of his friends,
they concluded that he should make a show of departing, but that indeed he
should remain concealed in Leanders house, where at this present he is, and
that in the mean time he should come every night into the garden to her by my
means; and if it should happen at any time that she should not meet him there,
then he should be advertised thereof, by not seeing a handkercher hanging at
the Window, which peradventure you marked there to day, and which makes me now
to leave you in have, for that the hour wherein Hortensio ought to come, is at
hand, being sorry that I have lost so much time in speaking of other folks
affairs, and omitted our own; howsoever, be faithful to me, and so be gone. I
confess, Madam, that this Wenches relation moved me more than ever any thing of
that nature had done; for ordinarily, in that which concerns Love, I measure
the esteem which I make of Ladies, according to that which they make of me; and
if I chance to encounter one who receives not my services, at least with
civility, I presently judge her unworthy of my choler, and love, and within a
quarter of an hour after I never think of her more. But in this encounter it
fell not out so, for still I conserved a little affection, and a great deal of
desire to be revenged. But before I would resolve on any thing, I was willing
to be yet better informed of the matter, and to understand certainly whether
Hortensio lay concealed at Leanders. It was my good hap, that Valerio, whom
questionless you know, and that has a wit very proper to imbroyl an intricate
affair, proved to be a dear confident of his. And whereas we had contracted a
great friendship together at my being at Rome, I went and sought him out, and
having found him, I soon obtained of him what I desired. He told me, that not
above an hour before he parted from Leander; how it was true that Hortensio lay
concealed in his House, by reason of an amorous adventure wherewith he was very
much troubled, because he was inamoured of a neipce of C^nthioes, named
Aurelia, with whom Hortensio had had a particular commerce for a good while
together: How he was in good hope, Hortensio going away, and having no further
pretension there, that he might have declared his love to Aurelia, but how far
from that, Hortensio, not only remained hid in his house, but had also obliged
him to carry a letter to this Gentlewoman, to crave her pardon for his parting
away without bidding her farewell, excusing himself upon this, that his grief
for leaving her had kept him from doing so. He told me likewise, that Aurelia
had received Hortensio's letter with much testimony of affection; that Leander
had been greatly tempted to discover unto her how she was betrayed, and to make
his profit of his friends deceit; but that in conclusion friendship had
prevailed with him above love. That being returned to Hortensio, he had very
much pressed him to let him know why he was unfaithful to Aurelia? how he had
freely answered thereunto, that his inclination was to Livia; how for the
other, he served her out of acknowledgement, it being most certain that he was
very much obliged unto her. How after all this he had demanded of him, whether
a friend of his should disoblige him in thinking of her, since he loved her but
for consideration? How Hortensio was netled with this discourse, and had
testified unto him that he would not endure it. Behold, Madam, the estate of
things; Livia loved Hortensio, and was beloved of him; I loved Livia, and was
ill entreated of her; Aurelia loved Hortensio, and was betrayed by him; Leander
loved Aurelia, not daring to discover it unto her, and was an instrument of his
friends treason; Valerio was Leanders confident, and betrayed him for my sake;
Lucretia for being faithful to la Roche, was unfaithful to her Mistress; in
fine, we all of us almost did that which we ought not to have done. The
business standing in these terms, I resolved to speak once more with Livia;
and whereas it is most certain, that when one comes to know that the person
beloved accords to another favors which she refuses to him, he changes
respect into boldness, and no longer demands her affection as a grace, but as a
debt. I went and attended Livia some three or four steps from her door, with a
mind that retained little of the French civility. At her first appearing,
followed only by Lucretia, I advanced directly unto her, and presenting her my
hand with a contemning negligence, I said unto her in somewhat a bitter manner:
It may be, fairest Livia, that being unable to merit any thing of you as a
Lover, yet in the quality of a Gentleman Usher I may be permitted to help to
lead you. I know not, answered she, with a serious countenance, what renders
you so bold as to interrupt me in my way; but I know very well, that if you
have not a purpose to displease me, and did know my humor, you would not be so
inconsiderate as to dare to speak to me with so much liberty; for I make
profession of a modesty, which cannot suffer such things, and which you might
very well understand by the coldness wherewith I have always treated you. I
confess that the discourse netled me; I could not endure this severe virtue in
a person that had none but for me; and that reproching me with her rigor,
seemed as though she would make me serve for the triumph of her Lover. I
retained her then by the arm, as she was offering to go away, and in a
quipping and jeering manner, beholding her with a malicious smile, I said unto
her; it is true, Livia, that I have been rash and inconsiderate in daring to
lift up my eyes toward a person of so extraordinary a virtue, as cannot suffer
one to adore her; as cannot endure one should speak to her of Love; as loves
even darkness, and hates the light, because it might discover that which she
would conceal from most men. Indeed, answered she, I hate the Sun, because by
it I see you. It may be, said I unto her with the same countenance, and looking
justly on her, that you do not hate the Moon so much toward midnight.
Whereupon she strove mightily to get away, but in regard I held one corner of
her vail, she durst resist no further, perceiving plainly that I no longer
respected her. Nay, said I unto her, as she would have gone from me, you must
hear me whether you will or no, for since it is a suit of Love, it is but just
that you should hear me, as well as you have heard my Rival; and that to be
well informed of the justice of our cause, you give him audience in the night,
and me in the day; for I do not desire that in consideration of me an
handkercher should be hung in the Window; that Lucretia should descend into the
garden; that a door which seems to be shut, should be left open; nor that I
should be a gallant, who seems to be absent, and yet fails not to be at the
assignation which is given him. Verily Livia's astonishment made me almost
repent for what I had spoken, but indeed I could not contain my resentment, The
first thing that Livia said after this discourse, was; Ah Lucretia, you have
betrayed me! But this Wench, who in this occasion appeared to me to be the most
dextrous and daring that ever was, answered her with an extreme precipitation;
I Madam! would to Heaven you were not more betrayed, in acknowledging that
which I never revealed. In the mean time, la Roche, who had heard all that I
said, was much vexed at my engaging Lucretia by my discourse; so that
approaching to me, he said softly to me in French, O Sir, what have you done? I
do not know, said I stepping a little back, but, if thou can, re-accommodate
this disorder. During this, Lucretia swore false oaths to her Mistress for the
clearing of her innocence; and the poor Livia was so surprised, as she could
resolve of nothing; in fine, we were all four exceedingly perplexed; I was
vexed for having spoken so lavishly; Lucretia was much troubled in justifying
her self; my Agent knew not what to do, either for Lucretia, or for me; and
Livia could think of nothing that would satisfy her: She would fain have
railed on me, but she savv that I was too much acquainted with her affairs to
be incensed more; She could have been contented never to have seen me again,
but she feared lest parting away without saying any thing unto me, I should
publish that which I knevv. At last, she would willingly have recalled me,
for I was stepped a little from her, and stood musing with my self, but her
heart would not consent that she should use any civility to me after that
which I had said unto her. Behold, Madam, the estate wherein we stood, when
as la Roche, the most daring fellovv that is, approached unto Livia, and said
unto her for the justification of Lucretia, with a seeming sincerity: I know
very well, Lady, that I do put my self in danger of being turned away by my
Master, in discovering a thing unto you, which he greatly labors to conceal,
but the condition wherein you are, and the innocence of Lucretia, forces me to
open it unto you. Know then, continued he, that whatsoever he has said unto
you is not the effect of my bodies treason, but of Astrology, which he
understands perfectly. It is a science wherein he is become so expert, that if
I should recount unto you the mervailes, which I have heard him tell, you would
be mightily surprised with it. And whereas he is passionately in love with you,
seeing you very rigorous to him, he has spent every night for these eight
days in contemplating the Stars, and turning over his books, to discover the
cause thereof, and without doubt it was by this means that he is come to know
that which he has said unto you: he has showed me, continued he, the garden,
where you were, in a great glass, though I would not understand what you said.
Truly the invention of this lad amazed me; it was in vain for me to make
signs unto him to hold his peace; the more unquietness that I showed, the more
he continued speaking; and I may say that I was never in greater pain, for I
heard all that he said. But whereas I saw that he went confounding things, and
that from an Astrologer he would quickly make me pass for a Magician, in
talking of an enchanted glass, I resolved to help forward this trick, that so I
might make him hold his tongue, wherefore I called him somewhat rudely, and
having commanded him to withdraw, I came to Livia with civilitie enough, just
as Lucretia was saying to her boldly, how she had already heard it assured
indeed, that I dealt with telling of fortunes. And having saluted her for the
better coloring of the business, I seemed to be very angry with la Roches
imprudence, in discovering to her a thing, which I would not have known, in
regard of the brutishness of the people, who imagine that one cannot observe
the Stars, without having commerce with the Devil; and know not how to put a
difference between Astrology and enchantments. But since the fault was done, I
desired her to oblige me to her discretion, by not publishing that which had
been told her. I said unto her also, that parting from the Court of France, I
had past through Provence, where happening to be lodged near to a great
Nostradamus, so admirable in this science, as it was not known whether he
should be termed a Prophet, or an Astrologer, I had been so happy, as to touch
his inclination, and to gain his friendship even to the point to teach me a
part of the excellent things he knew, either for Astrology, Phisiognomy, or
Chiromancie. In fine, I spoke to her with so much art, as she believed me; and
believed too that Lucretia was innocent, who on her side played her part so
well, as she made me ashamed. She clapped her hands together, she accused her
Mistress for having accused her; and the poor Livia was almost ready to make
excuses unto her, so well was she persuaded. And the cause why a discourse of
this kind did not surprise her so much as another, and was more credible with
her, was, for that she had all her lifetime heard her Father talk of this
science, who just as we were there came out of his house; as soon as I saw him I
would have been gone, but Livia stayed me, and said to me with a great deal of
spirit, I know too well what respect a man of your condition does owe to one of
my sex, to be affrayed you should be indiscreet; and since it is true, that y^u
do know the force of destiny, and the influences of the Stars, you may well
know by them, that I cannot eschew what they have resolved. In the mean time
the old man, who was not accustomed to see his daughter in such a conversation,
drew near, and after he had but coldly saluted me, demanded of her what she did
there? but I was strangely amazed, when as she answered him, that meeting not
long before with a friend of hers, whom she loved very well, she understood by
her that I was one of the greatest Astrologers in the world, and that being
curious to know wether she should be married or no, she had desired my
acquaintance, which the same friend had procured her. I perceived that Livia
had spoken in this manner, notwithstanding the request that I had made unto
her, to the end she might know whether I had said the truth; so that I resolved
to stand to it. But I found my self much perplexed, when as this old man said
to her in a grave tone, that many men had employed all their lives in this
study, and had taken upon them the name of Astrologers, but that few had come
to the point of deserving it. Then turning him to me with a more open
countenance, he said unto me, that if I were such a one as his daughter told
him, he would serve me with all his heart; that he was very much affected to
men of merit, and to the lovers of sciences, whereof the vulgar were ignorant;
and that in conclusion, if he should tell me truth, he must confess that in
times past he had given himself to judiciary Astrology; but that the trouble of
domestic affairs had kept him from excelling therein; howbeit that he still
knew enough to be able to discourse a little with me of it, if I would come and
vissit him at his house, whereof he showed me the door. I leave you to judge,
Madam in what a case a man might be, that knevv not so much as the names of
the Signs and Planets; I made use of confidence then in the encounter, and
told him that I would not fail to come and take out a lesson with him, and
assured him that he should have a scholar of me, which would receive his
instructions with a great deal of joy. Leonardo (so is this man called) took
this true speech for a modest civility; and said unto me again, that he should
be glad to hear me tell him something of his fortune; and to persuade me that
he was knovving he said to me also, that he had a great desire I should go
and dispute with him a little in his Cabinet, that he might know whether the
Planets (except Mars and Saturn) whose influences be the happiest, are not
they whose pararells are the greatest. Now for me, that should have been
healed of a quartan ague with a word less terrible than this, I savv it was
time to retire, which I did after I had told him again that I would very
shortly come home to him and show him my ignorance. He would have obliged me
to enter presently with him, but I excused my self dexterously from it, and so
departed, after I had saluted Livia civilly enough, and beheld Aucretia with a
sign, that testified unto her how I was sorry I had given her so much
unquietness in so little a time. I was not four stepps from them but regarding
this adventure with a more quiet eye, I found it so pleasant, that I had no
other passion but to make it last as long as I could: And this manner of
revenging my self appeared so sweet unto me, as I thanked la Roche above an
hundred times for finding out this invention, seeing it had succeeded so well,
Now entering into my lodging I met with Valerio, unto whom I gave an account of
all that happened unto me, wherewith he was so surprised and ravished, as he
could not believe that which I told him, so much did he fear that it was not
true. He would not rely upon my word, but would have the testimony of my Agent
too; and though I was offended at it, yet was he above an hour doubting
whether it were a jest, or a truth, which I told him. But in the end,
perceiving I spoke seriously he believed me, and this trick so pleased his
humor, and touched his inclination so mightily, that he loved me a great deal
the more for it. It was advised than, since the father had had a part in the
deceit, and that the business might be divulged, that it was better to have me
pass for an Astrologer than for an impostor, and to sow the brute of it about
the Town, before Leonardo should have leisure to discover that he had been
gulled: But I opposed this advise a good while, for, said I, no sooner shall I
be considered as a Contemplator of the Stars, but they will come and ask me
an hundred questions, whereunto I should not know what to answer, so that I
cannot tell how to turn my self in this affair. What you shall answer, said my
Agent? You shall answer, continued he, just as others do; sometimes I,
sometimes no, be it favorably or fatally, and for the rest, much good may it
do them; for in conclusion, an Astrologer never warrants any thing. Valerio
fell a laughing at this discourse, and told me likewise for the upholding of
this opinion, that this science being so difficult as it was, it might be that
chance would make me prophecy sooner, than all Astrologicall rules and
speculations; That I was but to speak alvvaies obscurely; never to affirm any
thing with certainty; to consider a little the quality and age of persons; to
speak seldom of the past, or the present, without good information thereof; and
of the future to discourse alvvaies by Emblemes, and Enigmaes, and commonly to
foretell more good fortune than bad. In the mean time la Roche went and got me
a book of Centuries for the forming of my style, an Almanac to teach me the
names of the Signs and Planets, and another Book which treated confusedly of
the manner of making of Horoscopes, of the Sphere, and of Chiromancie. Behold
me then well entered into the Zodiac, whilst Valerio and my Agent went as soon
as we had dined to begin the publishing of the Wonders of my Science. I set my
self then with a great application of my mind to the comprehending of some part
of this mysterious Doctrine; but at length I judged that it would be enough in
this occasion, without employing either the mind or the judgment, to make it a
labor of the memory; so that before Valerio was returned, I could already tell
that the Stars have three sorts of rising and setting, called Heliack, Cosmick,
Acronick; I could tell also that there are ten circles in the Sphere, six
great, and four little; that the great are the Equinoctial, the Zodiac, the
Meridian, the Horizon, and the two Colures; and the little ones, which cut it
unequally, are the two Tropicks of Cancer and Capricorn, and the two Polarie
Circles, the Artick and the Antartick. I knew the Septentrionall and Boreall
Bear, the Zenith, the Hemisphere, the Colure of the Equinoctials; the five
Zones, the Torrid, the Cold, and the Temperate; I could say too, that Saturn
regarding Hecate with a trine Aspect, and the tail of the Dragon folding it
self about the Scorpion, prognosticate no good; That Venus receiving the
opposite radiations of Jupiter, and Mars and Venus of the Moon, do presage
nothing but disorders: In fine, I knew the Parallels, the Ecliptic, the
Climats, the point Vertical, the Crab, the Bull, the Ram, the Lion, and all
those illustrious animals, which command over men so far off. So that Valerio
coming in, I began to make a flourish, and to tell him, that Mars and Saturn
being diametrically opposite to Diana, but without giving me leave to make an
end, he told me that he had such pleasant things to acquaint me with, as he
must needs relate them to me presently for fear of forgetting them. And when as
I had given him all the attention he could desire, it was a good while before
he could speak, he was so taken up with laughter. And truly I proved plainly in
this occasion, that this is many times a contagious disease; for though I knew
not what had arrived unto him, yet could I not forbear laughing almost as much
as he, so ready I am to comply with my friends. But at last, after he had above
twenty times interrupted his relation, he recounted unto me, that the first man
which he had taken in his trap, was Leander, whom he had encountered a little
from thence when he went forth; that as soon as he had perceived him, he had
made as though he had not seen him, and that passing by him with his eyes on
the ground, he said somewhat loud, I did never think that a man could have
wrought such Prodigies; That thereupon Leander had stayed him, and asked him
what those marvails were which he had seen? That he seeming to be much
surprised with his over-hearing him, had answered, I can scarce tell, so much
am I still transported with astonishment and admiration at that which I have
seen; That afterward Leander had pressed him very much to tell him what it was;
and whereas he would have been sorry not to have satisfied his curiosity, he
had consented thereunto, but that first he had used all the ceremonies of a man
that would deliver a great secret; that he had looked all about to see whether
they might be overheard; that he had made him swear that he should not speak
of it again to any body, unless it were to his most special friends; That in
fine he had omitted nothing of whatsoever might make him hearken with
attention, and render him credulous. And that after all these preparations, he
had said to Leander, would you believe that this French Marquis, who is so much
my friend, and with whom I am so often, could in my presence do the most
miraculous things that ever you heard speak of, or can possibly imagine? Now I
beseech you, said Leander unto him, hold me no longer in suspense; know then,
answered Valerio, since you will needs know it, that yonder man, whom you see
so joviall and so gallant, is the greatest Astrologer that ever was, or ever
will be; if so be there be no enchantment in that which I have seen, as I much
suspect. He declared himself to me this morning (continued he) and told me such
particulars of my life, as none but my self could know; and this he found out
almost in an instant, by drawing some figures upon a paper, and looking on my
hand, for he is also both a Palmister and a Phisiognomist. Is it not the French
Marquis (said Leander, interrupting him) otherwise the Marquis of Touraine,
that lodges here hard by? The very same, answered Valerio; I had never the
honor, said Leander, to talk with him above once or twice, but I perceived
then by his countenance and his discourse that he was, I will not say, an
Astrologer, but at leastwise a man that was addicted to extraordinary sciences;
howbeit I did not believe that it was at that point you speak of. You will then
be far more surprised yet, replied Valerio, if I carry you along with me one
day, when he has promised to let me see a woman that lives at Rome, and whom I
loved at such time as I was there. And this too is one of the least things he
can do; for if I shall tell you the truth, I have seen and heard a picture
speak, and that is it which causes the confusion wherein you see me. Leander
was so surprised, as Valerio told me that he changed color at it, and
earnestly entreated him to bring him acquainted with me, which he promised to
do, upon condition that he should not publish what I had told him, for fear I
might be suspected to be a Magician; and that at length, after many other
discourses on this subject, they parted very well satisfied one of another. And
for a conclusion, Valerio said unto me, this is the first fool I met withal;
then he recounted to me how he went unto the Academy, where he had imparted to
a great many the Wonders that I did; that to publish them the better, he had
told them unto them in their ear, and had prayed them not to speak of it, or at
leastwise not to name me; that going from thence he went and made a turn about
the Marketplace, where he had met with a man, who recounted unto him part of
the things that he had told in secret to the Academy, as one that was verily
persuaded of it; which had so astonished him, as to keep his countenance he was
fain to enter into a Tennis-court, where he had found another man, whom he
knevv not, that was talking very earnestly to five or six persons, which
hearkened to him very attentively, and assuring them that I was the greatest
Astrologer of this Age; and that he had seen me do an hundred things, which he
recited unto them. That whereas he could not forbear laughing, he had set
himself merrily to contradict him, but that this man without going about to
seek for reasons to convince him, had told him roundly, that he spoke in that
manner, because he did not know me, but that he spoke upon certainty, for that
I was one of his best friends, it being not an hour since he parted from me; so
that after he had recounted all these things unto me, said Valerio, despairing
of making a better encounter than that of this man, I came away to find you
out, so satisfied with my lie, as if it should always succeed so luckily, I
would make a vow never to speak truth again. After we had laughed well at this
adventure, and rightly admired the fantasticalness of the World, which loves to
believe, or at least to publish bad news, and prodigies, we saw my Agent
return, whose voyage had had a quite other success. He had met but with few to
publish that which he desired should be known, so that being mad for having
done so little for a man of his humor and address, he had resolved not to come
back till some good adventure befell him. He had sought then in vain for some
one to deceive, when as a Maid, named Camilla, who served Aurelia, said to him
in passing close by him at such time as one could scarce see, follovv me. It is
sufficient to say, that this Lad was brought up in my service, to make one be
assured that he follovved her foot by foot, for fear of losing the sight of
her. This Wench led him into a by-lane, where fevv folks came, for it was
almost nothing but garden walls; When they were arrived there, Camilla told
him, that a person very considerable, both for her merit, and her beauty,
attended a special service from me; that the reputation which I had of being
the civillest of men, made her hope that I would not refuse her; and that if I
would do her this grace, I should not fail then to be at a little garden door,
which she showed him in the same lane; and to oblige him to trust in her words
she gave him a note which her Mistress had written unto me. My Agent assured
her, that I placed my greatest glory in doing service to Ladies; but whereas he
pressed her to tell him what it was that Aurelia desired of me (for though it was
almost dark, yet knew he Camilla, whom he had often seen with her Mistress) she
said to him, that if I were such a one as I was reported to be, I could not be
ignorant, as he was, and therefore that might suffice for the present. La Roche
judged rightly then, that there was somewhat of the Astrologer in this
adventure, so that to help on the matter; you have reason unknown fair one,
said he unto her, to think that Aureliaes secret will be none to my Master, for
if he pleases he knows that which now we do. Alas! said the wench again, how
afraid am I of his acquaintance, and how do I wish that he may never think of
me. There is nothing to be feared, said la Roche unto her, when as he knows
your adventures, for he is as discreet as he is knowing. But at last after a
reasonable long communication, where Camilla still assured, that she would by
no means serve such a Master, she told me, that I was not to fail, if it were
possible, in being at that garden door the same night when as the Moon was
down; or if I could not be there accordingly, that then I would be there the
next night at the same time; that she would be ready at that place to give me
entrance, and her Mistress in the garden, where I should speak with her. I
confess, when la Roche related this unto us that I could not choose but take
great pleasure in it, and much desire to read the note that was written to me.
If I had as happy a memory as a Romanzes Heroes, I would recite it unto you
without changing a syllable, but since I have it not, it shall suffice that I
do tell you in general, how Aurelia entreated me with a great deal of
civilitie and affection, that I would employ that mervelous science, which I
exercised so nobly, in setting her mind at rest; that from me alone she
expected succor for her unquietness, and that in fine, if I were a Frenchman
(which according to her sense was to say civil) I would not refuse her.
Valerio was so ravished with this encounter; my Agent was so glad of it, and at
first dash I found it so pleasant, as we past away an hour very merrily. But
when I perceived that Valerio would have me try this adventure, my pleasure
diminished by the half: The more I opposed his will, the more he persisted in
vanquishing mine; it was in vain for me to represent my ignorance unto him, the
disorder that might arrive unto me by it, the perplexity wherein a man would
find himself to be, when he must speak of that he does not know; for to all
these objections he had wherewith to answer me. He in the first place laid it
down to me for a ground, that to the end I might not be taken for an impostor
by Leonardo, and to authorize the cheat which he had used to an hundred
persons, in assuring them that I was a great Astrologer, it was necessary, that
I should use two or three one after another; that otherwise I should lose the
reputation which he had gained me; tha^ if I refused to meet Aurelia, it was
impossible but she should speak of it to some body, and so I should be cried
down, and out of ability to be revenged of Livia by this artifice; that I
could not meet with a fairer occasion to make show of my art with facility, in
regard it required but the beguiling of a maid, who doubtless was well
persuaded already of my science, since she had been so hardy as to entreat me
to come and speak with her; that in fine, seeing Aurelia had been so vveak as
to believe things just as one would desire she should believe them, it would
questionless be very easy for me to satisfy her; And for a conclusion, said
he unto me, she is young, she is fair, she will meet you in a garden, and in
the night, judge now after all this, whether you are not to go thither. It is
certain that this last reason moved me very much; and I felt then such a
repugnancie in refusing a fair maid, as I made no longer question what I
should do; wherefore I prepared my self for it, and for the more security,
Valerio and my Agent armed themselves to attend me at this garden door. As for
my self I carried nothing but my svvord with me, for I could not fear that the
universal ado^er of women, should be betrayed by a woman. But before I tell
you what arrived to me in this garden, I must recount unto you, Madam, that
which was the cause of this adventure; for we were made acquainted with it
afterward; You remember, no doubt, how I told you, that Leander was the
first whom Valerio had persuaded that I was an Astrologer, and somevvhat
more; and that Leander was the same in whose house Hortensio lay concealed. I
remember all this, said the Princess, interrupting him, and to testify it unto
you, I remember that Leander loved Aurelia, and durst not tell her so much,
because Hortensio had some commerce with her, although it was Livia that
possessed his heart, and that Leander played but an outvvard part in being
constrained to serve the imposture of his friend, and to carry Hortensioes
letters to Aurelia as if he had been absent, though indeed he lay concealed in
his house for to go every night unto Livia in a garden. Since it is so, said
the Marquis, I am then but to tell you, Madam, that after Leander had been
powerfully persuaded of the wonders which Valerio had told him I could do, he
changed the resolution he had taken to stay till Hortensio had broken off with
Aurelia, into that of disabusing her by a pretty subtle way, if she had had a
true ground for it, and that I had been such a one as he believed me to be. And
behold how he reasoned with himself; I am going, said he, to Aurelia for a
letter which she is to give me to day for Hortensio, whom she believes to be at
Naples, or on the way thither, she has already showed a great deal of grief
for his absence; now if I can bring her to speak of that again, I will tell her
what Valerio has told me of the French Marquis; so that if she shall happen to
be curious to see her absent Lover by the science of this man, she shall
likewise see that he is not at Naples; that he is still at Genoua; that he
loves another, and by these means I shall destroy her affection to him, and it
may be make my profit of this disorder. This resolution taken, he goes to
Aurelia, who after she had given him her letter, failed not to speak of the
absence of her Friend, to ask of him whether he thought it would not be long
ere he would return? Whither he had not taken this separation heavily? and
whither he had not already a longing to see him again, though it were but
lately since he went away? Yea so great a one, answered Leander, who would by
no means lose so fair an occasion, as I am almost resolved to try the science
of a great and excellent man, that is not far off. Aurelia straitway would
needs know of him what he meant by that which he said, whereupon he recounted
unto her all that Valerio had told him, and a great deal more; that I made the
dead to speak, and those that were absent to return again, but in such a
manner, that one saw the persons, whom one desired to see, as if they had been
effectually in the place where they seemed to be; and that this was done
without enchantment, and by natural causes, but hidden from most part of the
world; that one must be very skillful in the knowledge of ideas and simpathies
for the comprehending of any part of these mervelous effects; but in fine, how
he was certain, that what he said was true. Aurelia hearkened to this discourse
with much attension; at first, she seemed to doubt of that which Leander told
her, but it was doubtless to make her self the more assured of it. For after he
had confirmed the matter unto her, as she desired it; and that he had told her
my name, she demanded dexterously of him where I lay, and by what way one durst
propound such things unto me, seeing I was a man of quality, and that made no
public profession thereof. He answered her, how it was to be done by request,
and that if she desired any thing of me, he had a friend that was very intimate
with me. She thanked him, and so civilly gave him to understand that she would
be well contented with his departure. He was no sooner gone, but she called
Camilla, who was the confident of her secrets (for she recounted all this to
me afterward) and reported faithfully unto her all that Leander had told her.
And for a conclusion, she shevved her that she was absolutely resolved to
speak with me, and to entreat me to let her see her dear Hortensio, of whom
she had not taken her leave. They reasoned a while upon this subject, but at
last love prevailed with her above good manners. Camilla told her Mistress,
that she knevv a man by sight which served me; so that without further delay
she chose rather to write to me, as I have declared unto you, and to make use
of this vvench, than to accept of the offer which Leander had made her. In the
mean time, the hour of assignation being come, I went to the garden door;
Valerio and my Agent stayed three or four paces of, till I entered, which was
not long first, for scarcely had I touched the door, when as Camilla came and
opened it, with a light in her hand, and told me that her Mistress attended me
in a Cabinet, which was at ^ne corner of the Garden, whether she presently led
me. It is very true, that when first I saw Aurelia, she seemed so fair unto me,
though she were half covered with her vail, as little lacked but that I had
spoken to her rather of the beauty of her eyes, than of the influences of the
Stars. But she gave me no leisure to deliberate on my complement; for she spoke
first, and desired me to pardon her the boldness she had taken in putting me to
the trouble to come to see her; she prayed me to consider, that since she had
failed in the respect which she owed to her self, she might well fail in the
civility which was due to me. I answered to this discourse with a great deal of
submission; afterward she spoke to me of the reputation which I had for
Astrology, of the things that she had been told of me, and how much she had
desired to see me. I received these praises with a carelessness, respectfull
enough for all that, which doubtless made her believe that I thought I well
deserved it. And still to gain time I lengthened this discourse as much as
possibly I could; but she, that came not thither to make complements, said with
a low voice, as though she had been afraid to be overheard, though there was
no body there but Camilla, that kept Sentinel at the Cabinet-dore; the Wonders
which have been recounted to me of your Science, persuades me, that it would be
easy for you, if you will, to spare me the labor to tell you that which I
desire of you, since without question you know it already. It is certain that
this discourse surprised me after a strange sort; and I believed, in the
confusion wherein I was, that I should find nothing to answer her with; but at
length, after a great contest with my self, it is for the same reason, said I,
that your modesty ought not to keep you from speaking; for seeing it is a
secret which I am not ignorant of, what you shall say of it ought not to add
any thing to your confusion. It is true, said she, but I should be gladder to
hear it from you, than to have it delivered by me; be not therefore so
rigorous, and if it be possible, do that which I desire without my telling it
you. This obstinacy made me almost mad, and I vow to you, that the modesty of
the severest Mistress that ever I had, troubled me not so much, as that of this
Maid. And seeing this confusion still augmenting, I said unto her with the tone
of a more serious voice; Fair Aurelia, I should be willing enough not to oblige
you to the doing of a thing that seems unprofitable to you, if I had not a
secret reason which constraines me thereunto; and since I must let you
understand it, know, that by the force of my art, I can tell not only that
which you desire of me, but whatsoever has arrived unto you, that which you
think at this present, and that which shall befall you hereafter; but if by a
plain and faithful relation, you do not show the consent you bring to that
which you would have me do for you, it will be impossible for me to serve you;
and beware, said I unto her, lifting up my voice, lest that which you call
modesty, be not an effect of the doubt you have of my Science, in desiring by
this essay to assure your self of it. There must be confidence in this mystery,
continued I, for I do not work only by the ordinary ways of Astrology, but I
think I have gotten some extraordinary knowledges which go beyond them: And to
testify it unto you, I will presently tell you, if you desire it, all the most
secret thoughts of your heart, but after that look for nothing more from me.
She stayed me then with a great deal of precipitation, and said to me almost
trembling, seeing it is a tribute which I must render unto you, I am resolved
for it; then she recounted unto me that which I knew already without
enchantment, I mean, that she loved Hertensio; but she told me afterward that
which I knew not, namely, that she would have me show her that Lover, whom she
believed to be at Naples, but was still at Genoua. This proposition put me into
a strange disorder; I told her at first, that the matter was not easy; that it
behoved her to have a great deal of courage to undertake it; that the
apparition of Spirits, which were not at that time in any other but a
fantastical body, did always bring fear along with it; and that she should
think well of that which she desired, before she undertook it. She answered me
then, that nothing which resembled Hortensio could scare her. When as I saw her
obstinacy, and that I was reduced to that point, as I knew what to say the
necessity wherein I was, rendered me ingenious, and I imagined a trick, which
has showed by the event, that it was well conceived. I told her then with a
more open countenance that her confidence pleased me; and that I was ravished
to see a person of her Sex have a Spirit hardy enough for an enterprise which
made the boldest to tremble. But to make it succeed, she was to write a note,
according to the terms which I would dictate unto her, and let me carry it
away to make my figures upon it, assuring her that I would tear it as soon as
the mystery was finished; and that this amongst the Learned was called, the
making of a covenant with the Ideas. She made a little difficulty at it, but
having told her how I could do nothing without that, she consented thereunto;
and by good hap there was a pen and ink in the Cabinet, and a Table Book,
wherein we found a white leaf. She began then to write what I dictated unto
her, which if I be not deceived was much after this manner.

ALthough you go in the night like an Angel of darkness, yet pass you with me
for an Angel of light; wherefore I con^ure you, O blessed Spirit, by Heaven, by
Love, and by the Sympathies, to appear unto me before my window the night
ensuing, as soon as the Moon shall be down, in the true form of Hortensio. And
do not doubt that so agreeable a vision shall fright me, for I assure you that
it shall give me more pleasure than fear.

Aurelia.


Whereas her mind was already pre-occupated with the opinion of my skill, these
equivocating words, of an Angel of Light, of Darkness, of Conjuration, of
blessed Spirit, of Heaven, of Apparition, of Vision, and of Fear, failed not to
confirm her in this belief. And then too I pronounced all those great words
with so imperious a tone, as I perceived her to be terrified therewith. After
this, I would needs see her hand also, and would have her fix her looks upon
me; I demanded of her the hour and day of her birth, and made many other
observations, which would be too long to recite. But at last, all these devices
being over, I quitted Aurelia, after I had promised her that within three
nights she should see her dear Hortensio, and so Camilla came to conduct me
forth. In traversing the Garden I observed that Camilla hid her face with a
great deal of care, for fear lest I should read the secret of her heart in her
eyes; and when aa I perceived it, I said to her, laughing for the making up of
the Comedy, in vain, Camilla (for so had I heard Aurelia call her) do you seek
to hide your eyes from me, when as I plainly see your heart. Now I beseech you
Sir, said this Wench unto me, mightily surprised, and that was naturally merry
and joviall, if you know my secret, do not tell it unto my Mistress, for then
will the poor Nastagio be turned out of doors. I had such a mind to laugh at
this simplicity of Camilla, as I got me out in have, for fear I should burst
out into laughter, or be stifled in the place, howbeit I told her in going
forth that I would be discreet. I found Valerio in so great an impatience to
know what I had done, as I could not make him resolve to stay till we came to
our Lodging to recount it unto him, for we had not made three steps but we
stood still, so that little lacked but we had past all the night in the
streets; but at length we came thither, where I recited all this unto him. Bur
the pleasure of it was, that I had been so accustomed to speak to Aurelia in a
grave tone, as I delivered every thing unto him just as I had said it. And to
make up the matter, there were some instances, where I was not very certain
whether I were not indeed the same which I gave out my self to be. When as I
showed him Aurelia's Letter, he demanded of me what design I had in making her
to write it? What design, said I, even to have it to fall into the hands of
Hortensio, who believing that Aurelia knows he lies concealed at Leanders
house, in regard she writes unto him, will not fail to be at the place which
she has assigned him by her letter, to see if he can justify himself; and so
will she learn that he is effectively at Genoua, all will break forth, Liviaes
concealed pleasure will be destroyed, and I shall be revenged. And if it
happens that she takes him for a phantasm, the reputation which you have given
me will increase the more. Valerio acknowledged that this trick was well
invented; and la Roche mas mad because he had not imagined, or at least
conjectured it, upon the sight of Aureliaes letter; but to comfort him for that
he had contributed nothing to the adventure which I had incountred, I left him
the care to cause the letter, which was directed unto Hortensio, to fall into
his own hands. Whereupon he told me without further delay, that he would go and
carry it to him instantly. And when as I demanded of him how he could pretend
to obey me so readily? He told me how he had learned of Lucretia, that
Hortensio was this night to go and see L^via; so that, said he unto us, it
being yet not very late, it may well be that he is not already come forth: I
know the garden door, and whereas he knows not me, I will go thither and wait
for him, and deliver the letter unto his own hands, as from Aurelia whom I will
name in accosting him. This advice seeming to be the best we could take, we
thought of nothing else but of executing it; and for fear lest some mischance,
which we could not foresee, might happen to my Agent, we followed him a far off
in this expedition, which succeeded as happily, as the undertaker of it had
fortold. For Hortensio retyring very late from Livia, we had had the leisure to
attend for him almost an hour before he came forth. If the passion wherein I
had been in for this maid, had been as strong still as it was the day before, I
had past that time with a great deal of unquietness; and I should without doubt
have rather given some marks of my resentment to my Rival, than have caused a
letter to be delivered unto him; but I never needed four and twenty hours to
cure me of such a disease I felt then nothing more for Livia, but an extreme
desire to trouble her pleasure; so that to arrive thereunto, I had as much
patience, as was requisite for me to have in this encounter. We set our selves,
Valerio and I, some dosen paces from the doo^, out of which Hortensio was to
come, under the jetting-out portall of an house, that was built after the
antique manner. As for la Roche, he approached nearer, yet not so far from us,
but that we might hear all that he should say unto him. And whereas it was
extreme dark, and that his way tied him to pass by the place where we were, we
conceived that we should hear, without being perceived, how he would receive
this message. As indeed, he was no sooner come forth but I heard my Agent say
unto him, that Aurelia having understood he was in Genoua, had sent him with a
letter unto him, which he delivered him; and that she earnestly desired him not
to fail the assignation she had therein given him, for that she would receive
no answer but from his own mouth; in regard whereof, continued la Roche, I may
not stay to hear any thing you would say to me, for so am I enjoined by
Aurelia. Hortensio would have laid hold on him, but my Agent was not accustomed
to le^ himself be taken, when he had no mind to it; Hortensio then was
constrained to be contented with that which had been said to him. We heard him
stamp with his foot on the ground, clap his hands together, and say with a kind
of voice, which showed both astonishment and grief; what devil has discovered
to Aurelia that I was here? It must without doubt be an effect of the secret
passion of Leander, who has hoped by ruining me with her to establish himself
in my stead. Some three steps from thence he stood still, and whereas we saw
that this adventure made him talk like a man besides himself, we resolved to
follow him. This design was no sooner taken, but he began to go on and talk all
at an instant. What said he, has my friend betrayed me? however I must see
Aurelia, to the end I may keep Leander from reaping the fruit of his cunning,
and that this incensed maid may not revenge her self upon Livia. She loves me,
and I do not doubt but I shall pacify her easily enough. But it may be, said
he again, that it is not Aureliaes letter; let us stay, till we can be cleared
of it, before we resolve on any thing. Verily, this manner of discoursing by
himself seemed pleasant enough, howbeit that which I found to be yet better
was, that we perceived (for we followed him very close) how though the night
was exceeding dark, and that we were in a very narrovv street, where it was
so obscure, as nothing could be discerned, yet had he broken up the seal of
this letter, opened it, and made as though he would have read it, at
leastvvise the noise which the paper made caused us to conjecture so. But the
ill luck was, that in handling it in this sort he let it fall, and doubtless
with the violence of his action he flung it a good way from him, without
purposing so to do, for he sought for it a pretty while after. We understood
this accident, both by the discourse which he held, and because he stood
still. We got us up, Valerio and I, against the wall; but I confess to you,
that this adventure was not pleasing to me: I was so afraid that Hortensio
would not seek as he should do for the letter, and so my design should fail,
that I may say I was never in more unquietness. Me thought he went too far
from it to find it; that he had forgot the place where he had let it fall;
that peradventure it was near to me, though I did not perceive it; in fine, I
was even vviling to seek for it with him; and my imagination so troubled me,
as I believed I savv it in twenty places, where certainly it was not. And
when my mind was deceived in this manner, I was in a pain that cannot be
expressed; For when as I thought that I savv it in a place, I understood by
Hortensioes going that he went from it, which so madded me, as I had like to
have lost all patience. But at length, after he had sought up and down a great
while for it, and that he had said an hundred things, which would have pleased
a man that had no interest in the affair, I heard him upon a sudden say with
much joy, at last I have got you again, and have not lost my labor: Whereupon
he went presently away, and I retaining Valelerio, who would have continued
following him, told him, that if the like should befall me again, I should go
wild; that this adventure was both too pleasing, and too offensive, for me to
be once more exposed unto it; and that withal we had nothing else to do with
him. We got us away then to our lodging, where we found my Agent, howbeit we
went not to bed before we had laughed sufficiently at the accident of the
letter, and at all that which Hortensio had said in seeking for it. In the mean
time he was come to Leanders house, where after he had read the letter, which
he knew to be written with her own hand, he was confirmed, as we understood
after, in the design of seeing her. He believed, that all those words, of
blessed Spirit, Angel of light, and darkness, which Aurelia had taken for
marks of enchantment, were terms of galantry, that could not part from a
spirit that was much incensed. He firmly resolved then to see her the night
ensuing; and thereby to conserve her to himself, preserve the reputation of
Livia, and destroy the designs of his friend, whom he was persuaded had
betrayed him; for he could not conceive how Aurelia could come to know any
thing of him other ways. But at length day came, which I past away with an
impatience that holds me still; for though I had the same very day two very
pleasant conversations with two men, whereof the one mocked at Astrology, to
oblige me thereby to speak of it, and the other said that it was the
excellentest of all Sciences, to carry me to the same thing, yet will I not
speak thereof; for even as I am now talking, I am in have to tell you, that
as soon as the time of Hortensioes assignation approached, I went and put my self
in ambuscado, with a resolution to see the end of my enchantment. Now it
happened, that the weather being extreme hot, Aurelia lay in a low room, whose
grated windows were upon the street, and where Hortensio had often talked with
her. But, Madam, to give you the full pleasure of this adventure, I am to tell
you, not only that which I saw, and that which I heard, but that which past
between Aurelia and Camilla, who recounted it afterward unto us. As Soon as
Aurelia had supped, she made as though she were not well, that so she might be
alone with Camilla, and when she was come to her Chamber, this wench asked of
her, whether she did indeed believe she should see Hortensio that night? For,
said she, how can a man that is so far distant from hence come hitherto you in
so short a time? The Mistress, who thought her self a great deal more able,
laughed to hear her say so; and took a great care to make her comprehend, that
this Science was above her understanding; and told her moreover, how it would
not be effectively Hortensio which she should see, but something that should
resemble him so perfectly, there would be no difference. Howbeit, said Camilla
unto her, what do you hope by seeing him so? what entertainment? what
satisfaction do you expect from it? Only to see him, said Aurelia, and if thou
be wise, said she, demand not why Love does cause any thing to be done, for he
himself is the reason for that which he forces us to do; And then my curiosity
is not particular to me, for I have heard of many women that use to do so. But,
reply^d Camilla, will you not be afraid? Never a whit, answered Aurelia. Just
as she was saying so, Hortensio, who I had seen pass by the place where I was
hid, and whom I had followed pretty close, knocked softly, according to his
custom, at the windovv. Which Aurelia hearing began to change color. It may be
you believe, said Camilla unto her, that it is Hortensio which makes this
noise, or to say better his phantasme? I do not believe it, ansvvered Aurelia,
howsoever open the vvindovv, and pull up the grate. This vvench had no sooner
obeyed, but perceiving Hortensio, they both of them gave a great shrick;
Camilla finding her self as very a covvard, as she believed she was; and
Aurelia being nothing so confident, as she had thought she had been. Hortensio
expounded this astonishment after another manner, and believed that the choler
she was in against him, put her into that case wherein he savv her, namely
with a countenance extremely changed, and her spirit so confounded, as she
could neither sit still, run away, nor behold him. And whereas he was come
th^ther only to appease her, he said unto her that at last this Angel of
darkness wa^ come by her conjurations to see an Angel of light. O me, said
Aurelia, it is the voice of Hortensio! but I am not able to answer him; nor is
it to speak to him that I have wished to see him. In saying so, her exceeding
fear so reanimated her forces, as she was able to get away into a Cabinet,
whereof the door was open. As for Camilla, she would sain have follovved
after her Mistress, but her astonishment kept her from it: Not being able then
to do more, or to say better, not knovving what she did, she hid herself under
the table. Hortensio was so amazed at that which he savv, as Aurelia could
hardly be more. In the mean time, that he might get her to come back again, and
knovving, that she could hear him well enough from the Cabinet where she was,
he said unto her with a languishing voice to move her the more; Am I come so
far then, Aurelia, only to see you, and will not you vouchsafe to look on me?
Alas! Cried Camilla to her Mistress, that which we think is but too sure, for
he says he is come only to see you. Aurelia, that was ready to die in hearing
Hortensio speak, whom she believed to be a phantasme, cried to him out of the
Cabinet to be gone; and that she made a vow how she would never see Hortensio
more; unless it were Hortensio indeed. He who believed that she meant he was no
longer Hortensio, by reason of his change, called to Camilla, with an inten to
desire her that she would get Aurelia to come forth to him again; but scarcely
had he named her, when as this wench, who had marked on which side the door of
the Cabinet was, moved herself with such violence to get from under the table,
for ^o esc^pe away, as she overthrew it, together with the light that stood
upon it, which in turning down was extinguished; The noise which the table
made, the cries of Camilla, the voice of Hortensio, and the darkness, so
frighted Aurelia (for she believed that all this disorder was caused by the
phantasme) as she fell into a swoon: So that although Hortensio continued
saying many things, yet heard she nothing of it, no more than Camilla, who was
fallen to her prayers. Hortensio seeing no body answer him, and having heard
some noise which I made with going to step back a little, that I might have the
liberty to laugh, he retired away in such a choler, and fury, as gave so great
a blow with the pummell of his sword against the grate of Aureli^s window, that
he all so batterd it; which Camilla forgot not to tell her Mistres^, a^
believing it to be the last effect of the devil, when as she was come out of
her swoon, which lasted till day break. As for me, I never troubled my self
with following Hortensio, who without doubt talked sufficiently of this
adventure as he returned, but coming to Valerio and my Agent, who stayed for me
some twenty paces off, w^ w^nt to my lodging, that we might have liberty to
laugh at our good fortune in this foolish matter. We were no sooner a bed, but
a new entertainment kep^ us from sl^^ping. I know very well, Madam, that the
recounting of it to you would be in some sort to pass the bounds of respect;
but the matter is so pleasant, as it were better I should want good manners,
then deprive you of the pleasure of hearing it. I will tell you then, Madam,
since your silence seems to permits me so to do, that Valerio had a setvant,
called Vespa, whose inclinations were proportionable to his condition, being of
somewhat a dull spirit; he never came a nights into the chamber where we
were, but to help to make his Master unready, and then went presently to lie
with la Roche in a room which was separated from ours only with thin bords and
tapestry hangings, so that speaking never so little loud one might hear from
the one place what was said in the other. When la Roche and Vespa were a bed,
this last demanded of the other, whether it were true that I knew all that was
done in the world, as he had been lately told? La Roche, who meant to make
himself merry with him, assured him that it was so far true, as that I
perfectly knew what any body did, if I did but know the name of the person.
Alas, said Vespa then, I would not be bound to serve with such a Master! For
how should one spend his life with a man, to whom one durst never tell a lie?
It is somevvhat an hard case, said my Agent, speaking a little lovvd, to the
end we might hear him; howsoever it must be so. I had as leefe die, said the
other, as have my Master know all the lies that I tell him, when as I return
from some place, where I have stayed longer than I should: for, as you know,
we want not excuses for the stealing of an hour to bestow in our pleasures;
Mounsieur was not at home; I waited for him a long time; he stayed me with a
purpose to have written to you; I sought for him in diverse places; your clothes
were not done; I was to see as I went along whither your Gittern were strung
or no; and so, according to the diversity of occasions, diversity of pretexts
are alvvaies found: But as for you, I do not see how you can live; you durst
not, I assure my self, entertain two three of your companions whilst he is at
the Comedy, and pass away an afternoon in making good cheer. I durst not
indeed, ansvvered my Agent, unless it were at such a time, as I know he had
great affairs in hand, and so had no leisure to think of me. Neither could you
have the pleasure, said Vespa, to recount his secrets; to say he is in love
with such a one; he goes often to such a place; he writes to such a person;
and that which is the vvorst, if he has ill entreated you; whether it be in
revyling you; or in threatening you with the bastinado; or if occasion serves,
in giving you a vvhirret on the ear; you durst not complain to your friends of
it: Whereas to me, it would be the depriving me of a great consolation, if I
could not say to one; he is more fantastical than a Mule; more extravagant
than a Hobgoblin; and to give him to all the devils in hell when he is
untovvard. For when I have said all this, I return home, as if I were well
revenged, and had said so much to him himself. As for me, said la Roche, mine
is none of the vvorst, and I am seldom in the case you speak of. I vvish it may
be so, replied the other, how ever you must needs confess, that he would very
much incommodate me in one thing; for how could one serve him well, or be
well clothed, if a man should not make some profit to himself of the money
that passes through his hands; I should be very sorry to steal ought from any
body, but in that case I must be excused. It is not to hord it up, that I take
any thing, but to do him credit with it; and then the recompenses which
Masters make us is not so great, but that we may with some justice recompense
our selves. For that, said la Roche, you have reason; and there I lose a fair
opportunity, which you enjoy. You are so unhappy too, continued Vespa, that as
I perceive you dare not think of quitting him, and of looking out for a Master
secretly, as we commonly do, when we find not our selves well with him
whom we serve: and to conclude, I should choose rather to be in the gallyes,
than in the service of this man: I should not have spoken thus freely to you,
added he smiling, for fear he should have known it, if you had not told me,
that he is to know the name of them whose secrets he desire to know; for as
for that which I am called by, he will be consened in it, because I took it
upon me but when I came to Genoua, by reason of a small adventure which
befell me a Sauonna, of whence I am. You would have reason for that you say,
replied my Agent, who was vvilling to put him in fear, if he did not know
mine; but if to morrow he should have a desire to know what I have done, he
would also know what you have said unto me; for otherwise his science
would be very confused. Then am I undone, said Vespa, but howsoever, if he
must know all that I have said unto you, let him know also that I never took
much from my Master at a time, to the end that he may be contented with making
me to he turned away. We burst out then, Valerio and I, into such a laughter,
as he could no longer doubt but that we had heard him without enchantment.
And whereas there was a backdoor that opened out of their room upon the
stairs, he rose in have, and got him away, so that we never heard of him
after. The rest of the night was spent in sleeping, but the next day I had
employment enough; for I was scarcely out of bed, when as I received a Note
from Aurelia, whereby she prayed me that she might speak but one word with me
at the Garden door, where I had formerly been, out of which she would come
forth, and seem as though she had met me by chance. I made some difficulty of
going to her, but at length Valerio constrained me thereunto. As soon as I came
at her, being still pale, and amazed with her last nights adventure, she said
unto me, that having been advertised since morning, how Hortensio was
effectively at Genoua, and had never been absent from thence, she found that
she had great cause to complain of me, for that I had not undeceived her.
Hereupon I was very much perplexed how to answer her; but at last I told her
with civility enough, how it was true that I knew of it, but having promised
her no more than to let her see Hortensio, I never thought of any thing else:
That if instead of this phantosm she had seen the true Hortensio, i^ was an
undoubted mark of the power of my art, which had constrained him to come unto
her, though he desired to be concealed. I acknowledge, said she unto me, that
this reason is so forcible, as I cannot destroy it; but since it is true, that
nothing can resist you, do me the favor that Hortensio, who as I have been
told, lies secretly at Leanders house, that he may go a nights to see a maid
whom he loves, may no longer love her; or if it be possible, that he may
despise and hate her. This proposition began to put me into such choler
against Astrology, that little lacked but that I had left Aurelia without an
answer; howbeit my wit served me yet this once again dexterously enough: For I
assured her she was ill informed of the matter, and that Hortensio did not lie
concealed for any new love, but that being grown jealous of her, he had feigned
a voyage to Naples, the more exactly to observe her actions; and that without
doubt she was beloved of Hortensio, as much as ever she had been. This poor
Gentlewoman was so satisfied with that which I told her, as she verily believed
it; and so I left her with a great deal of joy. As I was returning home, I was
mightily surprised, to see how the people began to note me, and point at me;
some saying, that I was a learned man; others, that I was half a Prophet; these
same, that I was an Inchanter; those, that I was a Sorcerer. There were some
too, that not far from the truth, took me for an impostor, and scoffed at me;
at leastwise I interpreted their looks and their actions so. I went then in a
rage to find out Valerio, whom I met withal some three or four steps from my
lodging. I did not recount unto him what had happened to me, but I quarrelled
with him for that he was the cause of all the confusion I was in. He, that was
ready to burst with laughter, asked me whether I had not given him order to
publish my science? Yes, said I unto him, but not to make me pass for a
Magician. You know, said he unto me, still laughing, that Fame augments every
thing; and then what is it you complain of? all the world is satisfied with
your skill, and that which should more content you, you are revenged both of
your Rival and of your Mistress, by giving them so much unquietness as you do.
He had no sooner said so, but Leander appeared, and seemed to come to us; I
would have declined his encounter by entering into my lodging, but Valerio told
me that he had promised him my acquaintance, and that he was too near then for
me to avoid it. Indeed he was so near as I could not answer Valerio, so that I
was constrained to receive the civilities of Leander, who after a great and
long complement, recounted unto me all his love to Aurelia, who loved
Hortensio, that loved not her, because he was engaged elsewhere; and therefore
he conjured me, as well for his interest, as for that of Aurelia, so to do,
that she might no longer affect Hortensio, but accept of his service. I was so
confounded with all these adventures, as I scarce knew which way to turn me;
howbeit seeming to consider of all that he had told me, at length I assured
him, that if he continued loving and serving her, he should be beloved of her,
provided he acquainted her with his passion. He went away very well satisfied,
and Valerio demanded of me, how I hoped to keep my word? I answered him, that
at last Aurelia would be weary of Hortensioes despising her; that Leander by
continuing to serve her would touch her heart, and to would think that he
obtained that by the power of my art, which was due to his own industry. But,
said I unto him, now that we have a little rest, let us go into our lodging;
howbeit we were scarcely in the middle of the Hall, when turning my head about,
I perceived Leonardo the father of Livia, coming to me with an open
countenance, which made me conceive that he had something to demand of me. I
received him with a forced civility, which might have made him know, if he had
heeded it, that the sight of him had put me to a nonplus. And to give him yet
more liberty to persecute me, Valerio, who took great pleasure in all these
things, made show of taking his leave of me, and went and stayed for me in my
chamber. Then began Leonardo to tell me in a serious manner, which vexed me
exceedingly, how he was ashamed that his first visit was to request a favor
from me, rather than to let me know that he was in love with the reputation
which I had gotten in so short a time; but in fine, that he might oblige me by
his freedom to use the same to him, he besought me that I would cast a Figure
to discover who it was that had got an Emerauld Ring which was lost out of his
house. I must confess, that I found my self then in so strange a case, as if by
wishing I could have become a Magician indeed, to get out of this cross
adventure, I verily think that I should have wished it. What shall I do, said I
to my self? What counsel am I to take? And what can I answer to so pressing a
discourse? It concerns not now the beguiling of an amorous maid, or an
ignorant Lover; it is an old man that says he knovvs Astrology, that will
discover my ignorance as soon as I shall speak; For to tell him a l^e about
this Ring, it will destroy it self: It were better for me to deal freely
with him; he will be obliged to me for undeceiving him; and then all things
well considered, I had rather spoil all my designs than put a trick upon a man
of this age. After I had determined to do so, I took a more serious look upon
me for to tell him, how it was true, that heretofore I had understood some
principles of Astrology (for I could not resolve to confess my self to be
directly an impostor) how upon that ground my friends had given me the
reputation of knowing somewhat; but that none of them had ever any experience
of it; how it was true also, that I had many times delivered my self to be more
knowing than I was, in some occasions, where feigning was rather a gallantry
than a crime; but as for him, I desired it should appear, that the reputation
which I had gained was not so dear unto me, as his friendship, seeing I
confessed ingeniously unto him, that I did not know enough either in Astrology,
or in the other sciences depending thereupon, for to be able to tell him that
which he desired of me. This discourse so clear and true had not the effect I
expected from it; for very far from being believed, I heard Leonardo say unto
me smiling, Had I not known by the report of others, that you are a learned
man, your humility would suffice to persuade me that you know much. I swear
unto you, said I laughing (for I could not possibly forbear) that I know
nothing. Even this which you say, answered he, is that which confirms me in my
belief of you; and thus modest and discreet, continued he, ought they to be who
know much; for their science makes them to be known well enough, without any
intermixture of their vanity. If I were what you think me to be, said I
interrupting him, I would acknowledge it to you; but it is certain that I do
not merit the honor you do me. I have already told you, answered he, that this
humility is the greatest science of all; it being most sure, that every man
which says he knows a thing well, is ignorant of it, since he is arrived at
the point to think that he knows it perfectly, But at length let us return to
our purpose, and permit me to tell you, that this Emerauld is graven, and may
serve for a Seal as well as for a Ring. I was so madded to see that when I had
told lies, I had been believed, and now that I spoke truth, I could not be
credited, as I was not able to answer him any thing, so much was I
transported with choler and unquietness. But he, who was not repulsed by my
silence, and that on the contrary conceived how I was thinking on something
to satisfy him, said unto me again in a gentler manner than before; You are
pleased to dissemble with me upon a premeditated design, and I consent to all
that you have said of your self, so as I may obtain that which I desire of
you; and to facilitate the business, said he further unto me, you are to know
that this ring was lost between ten and eleven of the clock in the forenoon.
Whilst I was in this case, namely in the strangest that ever any body was, I
saw la Roche enter with a paper in his hand, who said unto me aloud, that he
desired to speak a word with me about an important affair. I stepped then from
Leonardo and went to him; but I was joyfully surprised when I understood, that
Lucretia, for her own interest, and the better to keep the jest afoot, had
advertised him that Leonardo would come to learn some nevvs of me concerning a
ring, which his daughter had given to Hortensio, who had visited her about ten
of the clock in the morning in a riding suit, making show that he was returned
unto Genoua by his Fathers command; and that Leonardo having found them
together, Hortensio had made as though he had lost a letter, which a brother of
his had written him from Naples; that after he was gone, Livia seeming very
sad, and her father having demanded of her what she ayled, she had told him,
that the ring, which she had given to Hortensio, was lost, to the end he should
not marvel if he saw it no longer. This dicourse made me wonderful glad; I
took the paper from la Roche the better to dissemble the matter, and using a
great deal of civility to Leonardo, I desired him to excuse the liberty which I
had taken. He answered me, that with him I was justified, provided I would not
refuse him. I confess that the occasion of gulling him was so fair, us I should
have had much ado too forbear; and Leonardo too had such a mind to be so, as
he would have been disobliged more in not being gulled, than in being gulled;
besides, it was in vain for me to tell him the truth again, which he would not
understand, do what I could. He began again to press me; I resisted yet a
while; but at last, when I saw that he would needs have me devine, I spoke to
him with more certainty than an Astrologer, and more clearly than a Oracle, if
he would have understood me rightly. After I had made a turn in the room
without speaking a word, I made a stop just before him, and said unto him;
hitherto I have done what I could to dissemble the little knowledge I have,
that I might not do any thing which would displease you; but since you will
needs know it, I will confess freely unto you, that I have already cast a
figure for it upon the entreaty of a kinswoman of Liviaes; so that disguising
the truth no longer, I am obliged to tell you, that a man, whom you saw this
morning in a riding suit, is he which has the ring you speak of. Who would
ever have believed it, said Leonardo, that a man of his fashion and quality,
had been capable of so strange an action? But young people that have covetous
fathers, are many times carried to ill habits by necessity; howsoever I must
find out this ring, and if it be possible demand it of him that has taken it
away without charging him that he stole it. After this discourse he gave me
thanks, and made me promise to come to supper to him. An hour after he was
gone, came an old fellow, who had served Leonardo about thirty years,
presented to me by la Roche, that told me with a simplicity which made me to
laugh, how being resolved to return into his Country, and carry with him the
little money which he had gotten, he besought me that I would cause him and his
treasure to be transported thither in a moment, for fear of robbing by the way.
I know enough for that, said my Agent then, without my Masters meddling in it;
and when I had confirmed him in this opinion, away they went together. But
whilst Valerio laughed at my adventure, and I was thinking how I might finish
it, the poor Hortensio past not his time away so well. For it fell out that
Leonardo had incountred him just as he went out of my lodging; howbeit he
accosted him civilly, and said no more to him but that he had been an hour in
seeking of him: For Hortensioes countenance so little resembled that of a
thief, as he was somewhat afraid to speak to him. Hortensio answered
thereunto, that he would think himself happy, if it were to command him any
thing. How courteous he is? (thought Leonardo with himself as he delivered to
me afterward) and what a pity it is, that so handsome a man should have so
bad an inclination? Then taking courage, he said unto him, that having
understood there was a ring in his hands, which had been lost out of his
house, he desired he might see it. And whereas Hortensio was surprised with
this discourse, he seemed to be so confounded, as Leonardo no longer doubted
but that he was guilty. O me! cried Hortensio, what is this I hear? I do not
say, replied Leonardo, that you are faulty, but the party from whom you had it.
How unhappy am I, said Hortensio interrupting him? Afflict not your self,
replied Leonardo, for the hand which gave it you, has alone committed this
fault, and so you are justified with me. Whilst Leonardo did what he could to
conceal from him the bad opinion he had of him, he was persuaded, that this man
knew the truth of the matter; and to justify Livia as much as possibly he
could, he assured him that he alone was culpable; that he alone had deceived
him; that he denied not but that this ring was in his hands; and therefore he
acknowledged he had just cause to complain of him. This is strange, said
Leonardo to himself, that the more I would excuse him, the more he accuses
himself! I say it to you again, continued the other, that I alone am worthy of
punishment. No Hortensio, said Leonardo, you shall not persuade me to it; for I
am well informed of the truth of the business. Why then it is best for me,
answered Hortensio, not to make any further denial, but in restoring you the
ring to confess ingenuously that I was constrained by an inevitable necessity,
to do you this wrong. I know well enough, replied, Leonardo, what youth is
capable of, and what necessity will make one do. Hortensio, seeing Leonardo
speak so gently unto him, and believing, so ill did they understand one
another, that he knew all which had past between Livia and him, believed also
that he was to make his profit of this occasion, and to speak plainly unto him.
Since you know, said he to him, how to excuse my errors, will you be pleased to
render them legitimate, in giving me leave to marry Livia? you know my birth,
and you may know my estate when you please. Marry my daughter! cried Leonardo,
this proposition is so pleasant, as our conversation shall end there, for I do
not think that you have reason to continue it any longer, after I have assured
you nevertheless that I shall be discreet. Saying so, the old man went away,
and left Hortensio more amazed, than ever he was in his life, for he no way
apprehended that Leonardo would accuse him of theft; and to perplex him yet
further, Aurelia appeared, who believing, according as I had told her, that
Hortensio had not concealed himself but because he was jealous, would en
passant have said some manner of gallanterie unto him. But he, who was not in a
case to dissemble, and that saw well enough how his love to Livia was upon
breaking forth, said unto her somewhat rudely; you drove me away at such time
as by your direction I came to wait upon you, think it not strange then if
after that I never do see you more; and to recompense the love which you have
borne me with some freeness, know, that I am engaged in an affection, which
cannot end but with my life. This said, he left her, for to go in all have and
try if he could see Livia, to the end they might advise together about what
they were to do in so cross an adventure. In the mean time, Aurelia so replied
upon my words, as she had much ado to believe but that Hortensioes despisall
was a mark of love. As she was returning home in this irresolution, she
incountred Leander, who had seen Hortensio enter into Liviaes house, and
Leonardo presently following in after him; so that enforced by his passion, and
my counsel, he discovered unto her the truth of the History: He informed her
how it was by his means she was advertised in the morning, that Hortensio
never parted from Genoua; and that to let her see how Livia wholly possessed
his heart, he knew for a certain that he was at that instant with her; having
said to him just as he was going in, and he passing by, I will no longer oppose
your love. This discourse so netled Aurelia, as suddenly she felt a strange
revolution in her mind: After she had mused a little, and showed by her
countenance how great a combat she had in her heart, she addressed her speech
to Leander; If that which you tell me be true, said she unto him, I confess
that Hortensio is not only unworthy of my affection, but is also unworthy to
live. If you did not seem to me somewhat interessed in this encounter, your
word alone should suffice to make me give credit to all things; but in this,
where you are the accuser, mine own eyes must be the vvitnesses of his crime,
if you will have them favorable judges to you: conduct me to Liviaes house,
and be assured that as soon as I have disturbed their felicity, for I mean to
do it, I will establish yours. Leander, who would gladly have done more
difficult things, for the hope of a prize that was so dear unto him, told her
with a great deal of respect, joy, and love, that he was ready to obey her.
In the mean time it had fallen out, that within a minute after Hortensio was
gone in to Livia, Leonardo came home; so as he had no more leisure but to let
her know that her father had demanded the Ring of him, which she had given
him, and that he had used all his endeavor to dravv the crime wholy upon
himself; for as soon as Lucretia perceived Leonardo, she advertised them of it;
vvhereupon Hortensio was constrained to hide himself in a corner of the Garden
where they were, it being impossible for him to get forth without being
seen. When supper time approached, I went thither; for I was not sorry to
seek for an occasion of seeing in what case Livia was in after so many odd
adventures; as I was going along I met with la Roche, who told me that he
came from vvorking his enchantment for the man who was afraid of robbing by
the way; that after a thousand devices, he had made him get a stride upon a
pale, as it were upon an horse; and there having bound up his eyes, and tied
both his hands and his feet, he left him talking the maddest things in the
world, out of a conceit he had that he was flying in the air; and that to keep
him from being robbed by the way, he had taken his money from him without his
perceiving it. I rebuked him for his foolery, and having commanded him to
follow me, I entered into Leonardoes house, just as he was going to accost his
daughter, who seeing me, would have pulled down her Vail over her face, but he
not permitting her so to do, told her, that a man, to whom she was engaged for
the recovery of a Ring which was so dear unto her, well deserved to have the
pleasure of beholding her. We were both of us then very much abashed, for I
knew nothing of that which had past betwixt him and Hortensio; and she feared
that her father would give her some cruel check or other. Howbeit I was not so
taken up, but that I heard, in regard I was advertised of it before, how the
poor simpleton whom la Roche had tied up in this garden, said, that he had
dispatched a great deal of way already; and I find, continued he, hearing us
talk a far off where we were, that I fly very high, for the sound of voices
does diminish. In the mean time we were mightily surprised to see Aurelia, led
by Leander, come in, who appearing with an angry countenance put the whole
company into a great confusion. Leonardo, who perceived that this visit was not
made in an accustomed hour, could not imagine the cause of it; Livia, who
before time had had some jealousy of Aurelia, and knew that Hortensio was not
above five or six steps from thence in a green Arbor, could not tell what to
think of it; Leander though he was very certain that he had seen Hortensio
enter there, and Leonardo follow him, yet was afraid that he should not keep
his word with Aurelia; Hortensio, albeit he were hid, was not in the least
pain, for that he could not doubt but that he should have some share in
Aureliaes visit; la Roche too was not very much at ease to see so great a
company in the very same place where his traveller was, which still continued
prating, though not heard of any but my self, who in conclusion was not without
a great deal of unquietnes, to behold so many folks together, which in all
likelihood would complain of me. These several reasonings, which I have
declared unto you, were made for all that in one instant, for we were not long
without knowing wherefore Aurelia came; who, having neither father nor mother,
and living only under the tuition of an uncle, took more liberty to her self
than ordinarily the Mayds of Italy use to do. She advanced then with a boldness
that amazed me, and addressing her speech to Le^nardo, without scarcely turning
her eyes toward Livia; Marvail not, said she unto him, Leonardo, to see this
visit made to you, rather than to your daughter; seeing it is from you that I
expect the revenge I desire. You are abused, Leonardo, and I am despised by a
man whom Livia loves, and who at this present is hidden somewhere here about
your house; I desired to advertise you of it, that we might both of us be
revenged together. This discourse dejected Livia; made Leonardo knit his brows;
Leander shrink up his shoulder; Lucretia give back; as for Hortensio, it is
easy to imagine that he was but in an ill taking; and touching my self, in the
midst of the amazement wherein I was, I felt some joy in hoping to see an end
of this adventure; in the mean time I could not choose but hear the new Astolpho
say, what lamentable voices are these, and into what a fright do they put me,
ah, la Roche, am I to fear nothing? At length, Leonardo, being come out of the
astonishment which had seized upon him, beheld Aurelia with fury, and taking
her by the hand, What, said he unto her, a man hid about my house! we must seek
every where, for I will not have this suspicion rest with any body; come,
Aurelia, that I may revenge you, or be revenged on you, if that which you tell
me be not true. What a confusion of voices is here, said the Traveller? In the
mean space Leonardo commanded all the doors to be shut, and leading Aurelia,
and causing Livia with all the rest of the company to follow, he began first to
search in the Garden. We had not gone four steps, but they perceived this man
tied on the pale, who made a great coil as it were to go the faster. The sight
of him arresting all the troup, Leonardo asked whether this was his daughters
Lover; Aurelia looked on Leander; Livia began to take a little heart, hoping
they would search no further, and so Hortensio would not be found. But going
foremost, I untyed the poor sot, and said to Leonardo, that this was without
doubt the knavery of my servant, who was willing to make sport with the
simplicity of this man. He was no sooner untyed, but following his imagination,
Behold, said he, how at length I am come into my Country; it is fit I should
kiss the earth where first I drew my breath. And when as Leonardo demanded of
him, what it was that he did. Alas! Master, said he, are you also come into my
Country, with all this goodly company? La Roche approaching said to him softly,
you have not done all that I enjoined you, for do not you perceive that you are
still at Genoua The poor wretch grew then so astonished as he could not answer
a word. In the mean time Aurelia having told Leonardo, that this was not he she
sought for, we continued going on. And when Leonardo had demanded whether there
were nothing behind a Jasmin hedge which was right before us; Hortensio, who
savv that he should be discovered, because the Arbor where he was hidden was
hard by it, resolved to show himself, rather than to be taken with the
manner. He went forth then boldly, and speaking to Leonardo; Seek no further,
said he unto him, I am he alone who is hidden here, and that will not oppose
the revenge which you will take of me for it. This is not amiss, said Leonardo
to me, I seek for my daughters Lover, and I find a Thief. You think
peradventure, said he unto him, to steal another Ring from me, but I will keep
you well enough from it; and in the consideration of your Father, who is a man
of honor, I will only secure my self of your person. Aurelia thought Leonardo
was wild, in taking Hortensio for a thief; Leander and Livia believed the same
thing; Hortensio himself knew not what he meant by it; and I alone was he that
could clear this Enigma. And as I was preparing to speak, Hortensio said to
Leonardo, that he had loved his daughter two years; that he had had the Ring
from her; that he was no thief; and that he might know of her whether he told
the truth or no. Aurelia would have spoken, but choler would not suffer her;
Livia indeed had love enough to have confirmed that which Hortensio said, but
she was retained by shame, howbeit she was fain to surmount it, when her Father
asked of her, whither that which he heard was true? for she answered, how
hoping that this marriage would not displease him, it was true that she had
given him that Ring for the first obligation thereof. Leonardo had no sooner
received his daughters answer, but taking me aside he consulted with me about
what he ought to do in this encounter; for he did not suspect me as yet. I
confess, that then I took pity of all the displeasures I had done them, and in
that good thought, I counseled him for the honor of his daughter, to mary
them together. He told me how that indeed was the custom of Italy, and that he
was glad my advice was conformable to the use of the Country, which in these
occasions will have them to be either poniarded or married. Leonardo having
resolved on the last, came to them again with a calmer countenance, and making
some excuses to Aurelia for that he did not revenge her, he told Hortensio,
that for my sake he not only pardoned him, but also promised him his daughter.
These two Lovers were so satisfied, and so pleasingly surprised, as it was
impossible for them to express their joy; Leander was so contented in seeing no
further an obstacle to his love, as he presently summoned Aurelia to the
performance of her word, who confirmed it unto him with generosity enough. But
the best in this general rejoicing was, that Livia, in a gallantery, came, and
smiling said unto me, I counsel you another time to rely more on your merit
than on your science, since though you have wholly employed it for the
interrupting of my marriage, yet you see that your Art is deceitful. And
continued Aurelia, in somewhat a sharper manner, you assured me that I was
beloved of Hortensio, whereas I no sooner encountered him, but I see him married
to another, which shows that your Astrology is false. As for me, said Leander,
you persuaded me that Aurelia did not love Hortensio, in the mean time the
proof she has rendered of the contrary, testifyes the untruth of your books.
And for my part, said the Traveller, he promised to send me into my country
without any danger of robbing, and lo I am still at Genoua. All this was spoken
to me so precipitously as I was surprised with it; nevertheless being fully
resolved to continue no longer an Astrologer, I made use of this occasion; for
causing Lucretia to approach, that she might witness that which I meant to say,
I besought Leonardo to pardon me for that I was going to confess unto him,
seeing my gullerie had had so happy an end for him; and that he would call to
mind how it was not long of me, that he did not believe me to be no Astrologer.
I recounted unto them my love to Livia; in what manner I knew her secret, and
consequently all that I have told you. And after I had obtained Lucretiaes
pardon as well as mine own, I made it appear that I had satisfied them without
Astrology: For, said I to Leonardo, you asked me for your Ring, and I have made
you to find it; to Livia, I have told you the most concealed particulars of
your adventure; to Leander, I made you hope for the possession of Aurelia,
which she promises to you her self; to Aurelia, I have undeceived you from
Hortensio, and made you acknowledge the fidelity of Leander; to the traveller,
I promised you that you should not be robbed by the way, and I have kept my
word with you; for I am sure you are not in case so to be, la Roche having
provided for that by taking away your money, which I command him to restore
unto you presently; so that you see I have not failed in my promise to every
one: for touching my self, said I laughing, you perceive I am he alone for whom
I have done nothing; so that to recompense me in some sort for so many
unprofitable pains, grant me Valerioes pardon, which especially I demand of
Leander, as of the most offended, but withal the most obliged to his friends
gullery, since without him he durst never have thought of the happiness which
he possesses. In conclusion, said I to them still laughing, whereas you know
that I am a dangerous enemy, I counsel you, as persons whom I esteem, to
receive me for your friend. They burst out then into so great a laughter, as
they thought they should never have been quiet again to hear the complement,
which Leonardo made me, who assured me that the pleasure I had given him by my
relation, was so great, as he should always remember it, as an important
service which I had rendered him, and that he would not for any thing but that
this gullery had been, it was so diverting: Livia told me next, that she was of
her fathers mind, and though she had denied me her love, yet did she promise me
her friendship; Hortensio added thereunto, that he was so much obliged unto me
for drawing him out of prison, as he could not choose but swear an inviolable
affection to me; and Leander, who was engaged to me for the possession of his
Mistress, gave himself wholly unto me; for Aurelia, as she was least satisfied,
so was her complement the coldest, being contented only to tell me, that she
should never forget the visit I had given her, but nevertheless whenever she
had any hate, it should not be for me; whereupon she would have gone away, but
I advised Leonardo to send for Cinthio her Uncle, and also for Valerio, to the
end they should not part asunder till all things were peaceably concluded. This
was almost as soon executed as I had mentioned it; in the mean time Livia and
Aurelia, having talked a pretty while together alone, called Hortensio and
Leander to them, and such things passed between them, as they found themselves
all four extremely contented. Cinthi^ and Valerio being come, and a fair
conclusion made on all sides, the whole company supped with Leonardo, though
none but I was invited. Howbeit that I may not, Madam, further extend a
relation, which is already but too long, I shall tell you, that within a while
after I was bidden to their wedding, whither I came with more love than all
these four together had; for I had enough for every woman of the assembly. But
at length, night being come, I left them married and contented; I say contented,
because I am not an Historian but for the first day of their Nuptials, which
ordinarily is full of joy and gladness. Nevertheless that which troubled me
afterward was, how not able to keep the matter from being divulged, the same
people who had pointed at me before as at a Magician, looked upon me then as on
an impostor, and jeered me in such sort as I durst not peep out of doors. But
it is also true, that the same adventure was the cause of a greater good unto
me; for by the Count of Lauagnes curiosity I got the honor of his acquaintance
and friendship, which has likewise produced yours too, Madam, and has also
given me the noblest passion that ever I had in my life. I must confess, said
the Princess, that you are incomparable, and that in regard of what I have
heard, there is none but will say how you are a dangerous enemy, and a pleasing
friend. Ah, Madam, said the Marquis, do not ruin me with Aemilia! no, no, said
this maid, for I promise you not to judge of you but by your self, who, as I
believe, will persuade me that, which her Excellency speaks of, better than she
can, as eloquent as she is. I would fain know, said Doria, speaking to the
Marquis, whether they from whom you take your love, may pretend still to your
friendship. Yes, answered he, provided they have been favorable to me; for as
for the rest, they are so indifferent unto me, as it would be more advantageous
for them, that I should hate them. This is a pretty discourse indeed, said
Justiniano, since that by this reason, the fair Aemiliae ought not to be cruel
unto you, to the end she may by receiving your love favorably pretend one day
to your friendship. I confess, said the Count, that the Marquis his opinion
teaches me a new tenet, which I did not believe could be possible; I have
always heard it said, that friendship is many times a way to love, but that
love should be the way to friendship, is a thing which has but few examples,
and no reason at all. This dispute would be a little too long, said the
Princess, both for the time and the place, and I think it were fitter for us to
return unto Monaco before the ending of the day, which will not permit us to
walk; but this agreeable discourse has given us so much satisfaction, as we
have no reason to regret it. The whole company then arose; the Count led
Isabella; the Marquis Aemilia; Justiniano and Doria went together; and the
Princesses women, together with other of her servants, followed after without
order. All this fair troop went aboard of the Galley which brought them
thither, whereof the Princess never made use, but when she went to this place
The rest of the evening was wholly employed in talking of the Marquis his
adventures, each one repeating in particular that which had seemed most
pleasant to them therein. Isabella likewise caused her kinswoman, who had an
excellent voice, to sing; the Marquis played on the Lute, and sung also with the
beautiful Aemilia; so that concluding this day with Music, they bid the
Princess good night, and retired to their lodgings.

IBRAHIM: OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The second part. The Third BOOK.
HOw delightful soever this company might be, yet was the Count to return unto
Genoua, not daring to stay longer in a place whither he had been sent. He took
his leave then of the Princess, who desired him to assure the Senate of her
acknowledgement, and that ere long she would be at Genoua her self to render
them thanks in particular for the honor they had done her; The Marquis also
kissed her robe; she caressed him very much, and prayed him to remember, that
he left a Mistress at Monaco, showing him Aemilia. The Marquis answered
laughing, that he should not fail therein, and to the end she might not doubt
of it, he would take the liberty to write unto her. I shall be glad of that,
said the Princess, and will enjoin Aemilia to receive your letters. In the
mean time Doria, who was in love with the Counts sister-in-lavv, named
Sophronia, began to be in some unquietness for that he did not return unto
Genoua; which being observed by Justiniano, he conjured him to abide no longer
at Monaco, and to go along with the Count. Doria withstood it a while, but
at length he suffered himself to be persuaded to that which he desired. The
Marquis was so dextrous, as he took the opportunity, whilst the rest were
complementing with the Princess, to approach unto Aemilia, for to assure her a
little more seriously than he had used to do, that he had such thoughts for
her, a^ he had never before but only for two or three of all that great
multitude of women which he had loved in his time; it is likely he would
have said more unto her, had not the Count gone away. They departed out of the
Princesses chamber, accompanied by Justiniano, who conducted them to the Port,
where they embraced one another with a great deal of kindness, and also
renewed their friendship with new protestations. Having weighed anchor,
upon the Counts Signal given, the slaves fell to rovving, and in an instant
the gally was carried far from the shore, and from Justiniano, who in
returning to the Castle began to fear, that the Princess would press him to
declare the end of his History, and likewise to consider with astonishment
the deplorable estate he was in; but going insensibly along toward the
Princess, he found himself in her chamber, before he was aware that he was
com^ thither. This sad thought had already painted such a melancholy in his
face, as Isabella perceived it as soon as he entered, and for which she
quarrelled with him, saying that it proceeded from the absence of his friends.
Justiniano, surprised with this discourse, labored to recollect himself, and
told her, he had been so accustomed to s^dness, that as soon as he was but a
moment out of her sight, it still regained some empire over his heart. And to
keep the Princess from speaking to him of ending his history, he besought her
to be so good as to relate to him all that had arrived unto her during so long
an absence. Alas! said she unto him, what do you ask of me? Does it not suffice
that you know you were not here; that I believed you to be either inconstant,
or dead; and that being in a place wherinto I could forbid an entrance to all
the world, I have scarce had any other adventure, than to weep all day long, at
leastwise since the death of my mother, and the unlucky love of the Prince of
Masseran, which Doria has recounted unto you, as also that of some other
Sovereigns of Italy, where nothing has past more remarkable, than the
coldness which I have used toward them. And truly in so austere a
solitariness, I wanted not employment; the remembrance of our felicities past,
and of our then miseries, furnished me but with too much entertainment of my
self: and I may say that the memory of our good fortune was more cruel to me,
than the sense of our ill fortune. But, continued she, these thoughts are too
doleful, for so happy a season as this is, wherein I see you; and we are not
yet so far eloigned from the time in which we thought to have suffered
shipwreck, as to look upon this Sea without dread or grief. The adventure of
the Prince of Salerno, and of Don Fernando de Mendoza, said Aemilia
interrupting her, is not so inconsiderable, as that you should not be obliged
to impart it unto a person who has rendered you so exact an account of his
life; but if either your modesty, or your compassion, does hinder you from
acquainting him with the effects of your beauty, and the mischiefs which you
have caused without thinking of them, I do offer to make him a faithful
recital thereof. You will be unjust, Madam, answered Justiniano, if you will
not permit that I shall know what has befallen you, and you will give me cause
to fear that remembrance of some one of my Rivalls does touch you but too
sensibly. The Princess did what she could to remit the matter to another time;
but Justiniano, who sought to shun the occasions of speaking of the end of his
adventures, was willing to oblige the Princess to let him understand hers. When
as she saw then that he was resolved for it, she took a pretext to go and write
to Leonardo, the Count of Lauagnes wife, to the end she might not be present at
Aemiliaes relation. Justiniano complained for that she deprived him of the
sight of her, but whatsoever he could say, she entered into her Cabinet, saying
she would punish him for his obstinate curiosity. She was no sooner gone, but
Aemilia, having first been permitted by Isabella so to do, began to speak in
this sort to Justiniano.

The History of Isabella.
SEeing the Princess has commanded me to render you an account of her life, I
am very willing to obey her, having nothing to tell you that is not
advantageous for her, and also for you. I will not repeat her first adventures,
since I know that you are not ignorant of the Prince of Masserans love, Juliaes
violence and artifices, Felicianaes treason, Doriaes generous resentment, the
death of that unfortunate lover, and consequently that of Julia. But I will
only tell you, that when she saw she was Mistress of her self, by the loss of
her mother, and that she had in vain sent to seek for you in Germany, she
resolved to go no more to Genoua, but to live always at Monaco to avoid the
counsels and propositions, which she foresaw would be urged upon her for to
draw her to mary, though she had engaged her faith to you. For whereas your
long absence had made all the world believe that you were dead, there wanted no
reasons to be alleged unto her for the persuading of her to the change of her
resolution. As indeed, notwithstanding all the care she had taken, to bar an
entrance into Monaco of all those which might speak to her of such like
matters, yet the fame of her beauty and virtue was spread abroad in such
manner, as there was not a Prince in all Italy, which sent not unto her for a
permission to visit and serve her. But she, who feared her Lovers more than her
Enemies, brought so much care to the frustrating of all their designs, as none
of them could ever obtain so much as the liberty to see her. She lived in this
austere retiredness until such time, as about a year ago, or little less,
there ran a rumor in Genoua that you had been seen at Naples; whereupon she
sent the Lieutenant of her guard unto you, who, as you know, found you in a
place far from that where he went to seek you. It was much about that time,
when as, having lost my mother, I came against the Princesses mind, to shut up
my self with her, she being unwilling, as she said, that I should be made
unhappy for her sake. But do what she could, my entreaties were stronger than
her reasons, so that she was contented to accord me that, which I demanded of
her with so much affection. That false news which had been reported of you
gave her a true joy, and made her with the more case constrain herself, and not
seem to be so melancholy as before. But to the end her retiredness might be the
more supportable to me, she walked oftener than she was wont to do; she retired
less into her Cabinet, for the entertaining of her thoughts; and her compliance
for me, together with the secret hope she had of seeing you again, wrought so
powerfully upon her mind, as they dissipated a part of her grief, and put her
soul into a more peaceable estate. She took pleasure in recounting to me your
first adventures; she showed me your letters, and the verses which you had made
for her; and by the praises which I gave them, I quickly got more esteem, and
love, from her than I had before. She suffered me also sometimes to sing an air
unto her; and whereas she called to mind the passion which you had ever had for
music, I dare say, how it was more for the love of you, than for the love of
me, that she retained one of your Rivalls in her service. Aemilia, perceiving
that this discourse had made Justiniano change color, could not forbear
laughing at it; and desiring to draw him out of the pain whereinto she had put
him; Be patient, said she unto him, and judge not precipitously of a matter,
for which you will afterward without doubt repent you. I know, answered
Justiniano, that I should be unjust in desiring to be a judge of Isabella; but
I know withal that fear is inseparable from love, and that in this occasion I
ought to give you some marks of it. I will soon make it cease, continued
Aemilia, but prepare your self to understand the most fantastic adventure, and
the strangest encounter, that ever you heard off: You are to know then, said
she going on, how that great reputation of beauty which the Princess had all
over Italy, begot a curiosity at one and the same time in the minds of the
young Prince of Salerno, and Don Fernando de Mendoza, who for a long time had
been in the War of Milan under the Marquis of Gnast; and albeit they knevv not
one another; though the one was of Italy, and the other of Spain; though the
first was at Naples, and the other at Milan; yet took they both of them the
same resolution. The Prince of Salerno was handsome, of a good mine, and full
of spirit; and whereas in studying the Mathematics, he had learned to design,
he had afterward applied himself to painting, and was become so excellent in
that art, as few Masters in Italy had done braver things than he. This young
Prince being resolved to see whether fame did not flatter the Princess, and
knowing by the example of others, that it would be no boot for him to present
himself at Monaco with an equipage proportionable to his condition, he
concluded to go thither disguised; and that he might the easilier find out the
means to approach unto the Princess, he purposed to say that he was a Painter.
Don Fernando de Mendozo, as I have already declared, having a like desire, and
a like curiosity, used also the same means to content it: For as the Prince of
Salerno would pass for a Painter, so would Don Fernando, who understood music
perfectly, pass for a Musician. They disguised themselves then after the manner
they had resolved on, and without knowing ought of one another, they came to
Monaco at the time which I have noted; and when as the hope of seeing you
again, and the Princesses compliance for me, had rendered her melancholy more
sociable. The first that arrived at Monaco was Don Fernando, who retained this
name only, leaving that of Mendoza, as too illustrious for him whom he
pretended to be. And whereas the Princess had ordained a long time before, that
no stranger should enter into the Town, without first advertising her of it,
they came presently and told her, that a man, which gave himself out to be a
Musician, desired to enter. At first she thought not to have seen him, but as
for me, who had no other design but to delight her, I besought her to command
he might be admitted to enter, to the end we might see whether he were
skillfull enough to keep me from forgetting that which I had already learned in
Music; and to oblige her not to deny me, I caused her to remember the passion
which she had told me you had ever had for this excellent art; and it was
without doubt that in this sort the sole consideration of you introduced Don
Fernando into the Castle, although the Princess had the goodness to tell me,
that she should be very glad there could any thing be met withal, which could
keep me from being weary of Monaco. But in the end, Don Fernando appeared, and
albeit both the Princess and my self found something that was great in his
countenance, yet suspected we nothing of the truth, attributing that lofty air
to the Nation, whereof he said he was; for he did not conceal himself from
being a Spaniard, in regard, though he spoke Italian well enough, he would yet
have been known by his pronunciation. The Princess demanded of him, of whence
he was, whether he was going, what he could do; and to all those particulars
he answered exactly. As for his science, he desired the Princess that she would
be the judge of it, and hear him sing. She would fain have referred her self to
me, but giving her no leisure to command me unto it, I sent for a Violl and a
Lute, to the end he might show us what he could do. I well observed, how he
beheld the Princess with a great deal of attention, and also how he blushed two
or three times. But whereas the greatest beauties strike every one with
admiration, I took his blushing for a mark of his respect, and his attention
for an ordinary effect of Isabellaes beauty. When that was brought which I had
sent for, he took a Lute, and truly touched it reasonably well; but when he had
played on it, and that to sing he had taken a Violl in his hand, he persuaded us
yet better by his play, that he was a Spaniard, than he had done by his
pronunciation, it being most certain that it is impossible to play better: He
sung also with a very good grace, and with much art; As for me, I confess unto
you that I was ravished with it. And whereas the Princess perceived the
satisfaction that I received by it, and was resolved to please me as much as
she could, she demanded of Don Fernando, whether he would abide with her for
some time to be my Master? He very well contented with this proposition, told
her, that she did him too much honor, and though his purpose was not to make
any stay at Monaco, yet should he esteem himself infinitely happy, if he could
be able to render her any service. Thus see you Don Fernando lodged in the
Castle, and in the rank of the Princesses domestical servants, but more yet,
of that of her lovers. For as we know afterward, he became so desperately in
love with her, as he resolved to do all that he might for to gain her to
himself, by any way whatsoever. Certain days after, the Prince of Salerno, who
gave himself the name of Lucilio, arrived also at Monaco, and according to
order it was told the Princess, how there was a young Painter, who said, he
came from Rome, that desired to show her some small pieces of his own
dravving. She who, as I have already declared, sought to delight me, commanded
him to be brought to her; Don Fernando was at that time in the Princesses
chamber, whom I had caused to come thither to hear a Spanish air, which had
extremely pleased me. The Prince of Salerno being come to the Castle, entered
into the room, where we were, with a profound respect, and showed the Princess
two small pieces of his drawing, admirably well done. In the first was seen a
Sea represented, whose waves seemed to be very much moved, and a far of on the
shore a man, who, manger the counsel of diverse persons, which seemed by their
actions to hinder him from it, leapt into a skiff, and abandoned himself to the
fury of the Sea, showing them with one hand the point of a Rock, which stood up
in the midst of this Sea, as if he had a desire to go and suffer shipwreck
there. The second picture was an Icarus, of an extraordinary design; and though
the first piece expounded unto us that of the Prince of Salerno, yet did we not
understand any part of that emblem; and the Princess, without comprehending
ought that was mysterious therein, exceedingly commended his work. For, as you
know, she might be a competent judge of such like things, in regard she herself
could paint very well, though since your departure she has wrought so little,
as one may say, she has nothing left but the bare knowledge of that rare art,
having utterly lost the use of applying the colors. In the mean time the
Princess finding those two pieces to her mind, bought them to bestow on me. And
having demanded of this pretended Painter, whether he could work in great, as
well as in little, and he answering that it was ordinary with him, she resolved
to have him paint a Ca^inet that was within the lodgings, which she had given
me, to the end she might at leastwise render my prison the more agreeable, as
she said. She demanded of him if he would undertake it; and he, more contented
than I am able to tell you, expressed a mighty desire to be at her service; so
that the matter being resolved on, and the Princess having commanded him to see
the Cabinet, and to think of contriving the design thereof, she appointed him
to be lodged with Don Fernando, holding it an injustice to separate two such
fair sisters, as Music and Painting; and so did she lodge the two Rivals
together, that is to say, two Enemies, without her knowing of it, and without
their knowing of it also. For if Don Fernando was become amorous at the first
sight of the Princess, the Prince of Salerno was charmed with it. I very well
perceived, as well as Don Fernando, how He beheld her with an extraordinary
attention; but I marvailed yet less at that than at the other, imagining that
as he was a Painter, so being well seen in beauties, he would conserve some
Idea of that of the Princess, to make use thereof in his Pictures. Don Fernando
and he complemented very kindly one with another, and were as great friends at
first, as they were foes afterward. They thought in the mean while, each of
them in particular, of the design they had in hand, and dexterously informing
themselves of the Princesses mind, they learnt how she loved you still, and
that although the greatest part of the World believed you to be dead, yet was
she absolutely resolved never to engage that faith unto another, which she had
given you: Whereupon they conceived it would be to no purpose for them to
discover themselves as yet to the Princess; but contrarily, that it would be
the means of ruining all their designs, and depriving them of her sight for
ever. Wherefore they resolved to continue with her as long as they could;
carefully to observe her disposition; to please her as much as possibly they
could; and to work according to occasion. For afterward we understood both all
their designs, and all their reasonings, which in this encounter were almost
the very same. Behold them then in the determination to render themselves
agreeable to the Princess, and to me also, because they perceived that I was
gracious with her. Don Fernando taught me Music with a great deal of care, and
concealed none of the secrets of his Art from me; yet sometimes he was vexed for
that I learned so fast; for, said he to himself, as we understood afterward,
as soon as she knows as much as I know, I shall be discharged; and if I do
not teach her as I should, they will turn me away. Howsoever he made choice of
the first, and indeed was one of the best Masters in the World. The Painter on
the other side drew out the designs of his Pictures, where I think he put all
the disguisements of Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury, and of all the other Gods of the
Fiction. But the best was, that what he did to continue the longer at Monaco,
had like to have driven him from thence; for fearing lest he should be
discarded when the painting of this Cabinet came once to be finished, he
wrought so slowly, as one might say it was Penelopes Web, and how he undid that
in the night which he had done in the day. Nevertheless, whereas the little
which he did was very excellent, the Princess would not follow the coun^ell
that my impatience gave he about it. Now if the Prince of Salerno intimated
love to the Princess by his Pictures, the Musician did no less by his Songs;
for with equivocating words he told her what he was, and what he thought. But
she had her mind so eloigned from such like things, as she made no application,
either of the one, or of the other of them to her self. In the mean time, these
two Rivals becoming every day more and more amorous, and the Princess always
expressing a great deal of goodness toward them, they believed, each of them
in his particular, that she esteemed them enough to pardon a violence when as
they should execute it; though not enough to receive the^ favorably when as
she might refuse them: so that carried with some hope, and a great deal of
despair all at once, the Prince of Salerno, by the means of the Master of his
Horse, who came into the Town in the habit of a Fisherman, to know if he
wanted any thing, gave order to have a vessel of War brought near to Monaco,
for the design which he premeditated: And Don Fernando, who knew well enough
that the Spaniards do not disapprove of those who augment their dominion by any
way whatsoever, sent a Gentleman, whom he had drawn disguised into the town,
to f^tch him money, and some troops of the Milanese, by the permission of the
Marquis of Guast, to whom he wrote about it, for the executing of that which he
thought on. During these preparations, the Painter and the Musician continued
their endeavors still about the Princess; the one always made mysterious
Pictures, and the other always sung Songs, wherein he spoke of love without
being understood, so that they came to be somewhat suspicious one of another;
and that which began to make them so, was, for that Don Fernando not seeing the
Princess enough to content the extreme passion wherein he was for her, had
entreated the Painter in private to draw her picture for him, and let no body
know of it. The manner of Don Fernandoes making this proposition begot some
suspicion in the Prince of Salerno; and the manner also of his excusing himself
from embracing it, made Don Fernando observe him with the more care; so that
passing over again in their memory how they had lived together before, they
found wherewith to augment their suspicions, but not wherewith to doubt of that
which they thought. After this they never lived well together; they traduced one
another profession; the Painter said that he had heard better singing at Rome;
and the other affirmed that all the designs of the Prince of Salernoes Pictures
were stolen from ancient Painters. One day as they were in the Princesses
chamber, they entered into a dispute before her, and by that liberty forgot the
personage which they represented; yet was not she offended at it, but
contrarily took pleasure in hearing them. The Painter would have his Art carry
it from Music; he said that it was the imitator of Nature; he vaunted that he
could beguile the eyes, and deceive reason by the illusions of perspective; he
said moreover, that it was Painting which made men live after their death; that
it was she which erected Tropheis for the victorious; that by her we see
battles which we had not seen; that by her we know Alexander and all the Heroes
of Antiquity; that by her we make voyages without stirring out of our Cabinets;
that by her we see our friends though they be absent; that she was a visible
History, a mute Poesy; and to say all, that she was so excellent, as a good
Painter might almost boast himself to be the creator of the things which he
represents. The Musician, who would not give place to the Painter, maintained,
that there was the same difference between Painting and Music, as between the
body and the soul; that this first was wholly material and gross in comparison
of the other, which was altogether spiritual; that if Painting erected
Tropheis to the victorious, Music sung their victoryes; that the one touched
naught but the eyes, whereas the other, all celestial and divine, wrought upon
the very soul with so much power, as she excited or appeased the passions as
she pleased; and by this sweet tyranny rendered her self absolute mistress of all
reasonable persons. He said farther, that to judge rightly of the advantage
which she had over Painting, we were but to consider, that the best illusions
she can make, do always work a greater effect upon the rude vulgar than on
worthy people; that indeed she might strike these with admiration, but never
utterly deceive them, so that she operates more powerfully upon the ignorant
than on the able. He added, that it was not so with Music, which did not
predominate absolutely but over reasonable person: that to have wit is not
enough for us to become her subjects, and be charmed by her; but we must also
have, not only some knowledge of this Art, but likewise a great and noble soul;
so that quite contrary to Painting, the more able we are, the more we suffer
our selves to be vanquished by her charms: That the other was but a deceiver,
which pays us with nothing but apparences, and so impotent, that she can do
nothing of her self, or to say better, that she is nothing without the help of
cloth, pencils, and colors; That the beauties of Music were effective
beauties, and to show her independency we are but to consider, that she is no
other than a pure effect of the imagination, guided by judgment; so that
having no need of foreign things, it is not hard to judge, what advantage she
has over Painting. It is certain, that the dispute of these two men seemed too
transcendent to me for persons of their profession, and I began to look on the
Princess in a manner, which testified unto her how much I was amazed thereat,
when as Don Fernando, perceiving it, took presently upon him the humor, which
is ordinarily attributed to Musicians; and with a caprichiousness, wherein no
feigning appeared, he gave an hundred geering quipps to the Prince of Salerno,
who played his part as well as the other; so that returning out of the
amazement which I had been in, I reflected no further upon it, but heard the
rest of their dispute with great delight; for they made so pleasant a Satyr
against each others profession, as the Princess herself, spite of her
melancoholy, could not forbear laughing. Howbeit she would have them become
friends before they departed; and having demanded of them why they bore such a
spleen one to an other, for she had been advertised of it, they were much
troubled how to answer her. Don Fernando, being ever the bolder, spoke first in
this encounter, and told her, that on his part she was the true cause of it.
The Painter, exceedingly surprised with this discourse, knew not what to think
thereof; when as Don Fernando prosecuting it, gave them to understand, how that
which made him so averse unto him, was the thought he had, that when he should
be gone from Monaco, the Princess could not choose but remember him, because she
should always see his Pictures, whereas if it were his ill fortune to depart
from thence, she would presently forget him, nothing remaining of him that
might make him be remembered of her. If this jealousy did not show as much
malice as affection, replied the Painter, I should fear the Princess might take
it well at your hands, but as I believe her to be very equitable, so I think
she will find the coldness which is betwixt us better grounded, when as I shall
tell her, that our dissension proceeds from our not knowing one another. Or it
may be, said Don Fernando interrupting him, from our knowing one another too
well. Never a whit replied the Painter, for you are as unskilful in painting,
as I am in music, and so we are but bad judges of each other; and it is the
Princess alone, which will one day put a difference between us, when as she
shall know me b^tter: and that the designs which I am about shall be wholly
finished. The Princess, who thought he spoke of the designs of his Pictures,
told him, that she knew him enough already to admire all that he did. And
whereas Don Fernando would have replied, she forbad him, and commanded them
both to live better together afterward, than they had done. They answered,
that they would obey her as much as they could, and so retired with a great
deal of unquietness. The Prince of Salerno found Don Fernando too ha^dy for a
Musician, and found also, that all his songs were too passionate, too amorou^,
and suiting too much with the Princess, for to be sung without design. In fine,
he thought, that as he was capable of disguising himself like a Painter, so
might another be of disguising himself like a Musician. Nevertheless this
likely suspicion continued not long with him; and considering how much men of
this profession are caressed by great persons, he no longer mervailed at his
boldness; he found likewise that his observations upon his songs were
ridiculous; for, said he, as we understood since, upon what subject would I
have them made, that they should not suit with the Princess? All songs for the
most part are of love, they speak of beauty, of despair, of respect, of fear,
of Jealousy; they say that they dare not discover themselves; that love would
have them, and that respect will not suffer them to do so: And whereas few
songs are made upon giving of thanks, I am not to wonder if Don Fernando sings
that, which is sung every where, and in all languages. Whilst the Prince of
Salerno deceived himself in this sort, the Musician reasoned with himself about
that which had passed between them; but that which he stood most upon, was his
observation, that in all the designs which this Painter had drawn at Monaco,
there was always some disguisement in them. Howbeit he himself destroyed his
own reasonings, as well as the Prince of Salerno; and coming to consider, that
Fiction is one of the greatest sciences of Painters, he changed his op^nion:
And that which prevailed yet more with him, was to see him, whom he beheld
many times as his Rival, paint so excellently; for he could not imagine that a
man of quality could understand this Art so perfectly. These diverse thoughts
were never for all that so well settled in their minds, but that they past
often from the one to the other, and so were always ready to quarrel one with
another. Sometimes the interest of their Nations was the occasion of their
disputes; and if the Princess authority, joined to the fear which they had of
venturing themselves unseasonably, and destroying their designs, had not kept
them from it, they had without doubt fought more than once. In the mean time
the Princess and I lived without suspecting any thing of the truth; Howbeit I
remember, that one day it came into my thought, that there was something
extraordinary in Don Fernando; for teaching me an air which I found to be
extremely passionate, and of his own making, I demanded of him laughing,
whether it were possible for him to speak so of love, without being in love. He
answered me thereunto, that he could not, for that it was impossible for him to
speak against his heart. But, said I unto him, may not I be your confident, and
may not I know the person for whom you make such excellent things? You would no
sooner be my confident, answered he, but you would be mine enemy, wherefore I
will not tell you any thing, nor shall you know it but when I can no longer
conceal it. I confess my simplicity unto you, for my first apprehension being
over, I believed that I had some share in this discourse; and fearing I should
be obliged to entreat the Princess to turn Don Fernando away, if he came to
lose the respect which he owed me, I pressed him no further, contenting my self
with being his scholar, and not his confident. And I was so afraid to part
with him, as I never spoke of this matter to the Princess, who past a good part
of her time in seeing the Prince of Salerno paint.

In the mean space these two disguised Lovers finding no reason for them to
discover themselves, were even in despair with it. They saw the Princess every
day more firm in the resolution she had taken; for whereas they were dextrous
and interessed, they had so gained some of the Princesses Officers, as by them
they knew all that did pass, and all that had past. I have told you already,
that the Princess employed a good part of the day in seeing him paint, this
entertainment agreeing better with her melancholy, than Music; It was then
impossible, but that, being good as she is, the Prince of Salerno should often
have occasion to talk with her; and in those incounters, she had found so much
spirit and civility in him, as one day she pressed him to let her know where he
had led his life. And whereas he had taken a resolution, which you shall
understand by and by, he answered her, that he had never had any other Master
but the Prince of Salerno, who was one of the most considerable, both for his
birth and riches, that was in all the Kingdom of Naples; that it had been in
his late fathers house where he had learned to know the fashions of the world
better, than ordinarily Painters do; and that not long before, through a
mischance, which he could not avoid, he was come away from the Prince of
Salernoes service; But, Madam, continued he, though I be from him, I cannot
choose but say, that his inclinations are great; that he loves glory and virtue,
for touching his wit, it is not for me to judge of it. I mervail, said the
Princess unto him, if he be such as you say, that you would leave him; for
being great in birth, mighty in riches, and so virtuous as you paint him forth
to be, he must also without doubt be liberal, so that I do not see any reason
for your abandoning him. That is it, Madam, answered he, wherein I can not
satisfy you; howsoever I can assure you, that next to you, there is no body in
the world whom I would serve with more affection. It was in this sort that the
Prince of Salerno began to give good impressions of himself to the Princess,
that he might prepare her the better to his desire; and diverse times the
Princess and he had such like conversations. At length that Master of his
horse, whom he had sent to Naples, returned unto the Town disguised as he used
to be, and acquainted him, that he had left at Villa-franco, which as you know
is near hereunto, a vessel thoroughly furnished with all things, and an hundred
well resolved and affectionate soldiers in her. The Prince told him, that he
would have him come and present himself the next day at Monaco; and giving him
a letter for the Princess, and another for his Governor, who was come thither
whither he would or no, he gave him an express charge not to make any show of
knowing him, if so be his people should happen to be admitted into the Town. He
sent him away then thoroughly instructed in all that he had to do. The day
following, the vessel belonging to the Prince of Salerno (who that day found
out the means to be near the Princess) presented it self for to enter into the
port; but according to order, a barque having been sent unto it, and having
understood what this vessel was, the Prin^ess was presently advertised
thereof, who continuing in her resolution, commanded, that the Prince of
Salernoes messenger and his train only should be admitted, and that withal
they should come into the port in the same barque which had been sent forth to
discover them. The business was executed as she had commanded it; the Painter,
the Musician, and my self, were at that time with her; and whereas she
remembered that this Painter had told her, how he had belonged to the Prince of
Salerno: You shall see now, said she unto him, that your old Master will draw
you away from my service; if it should be so, continued she, what answer will
you have me make? That I will die rather than abandon you, replied he: But I do
not think it is his design, and knowing him as I do he will rather increase the
number of your servants, than rob you any. As he said thus, his people arrived,
who, without making show of knowing him, saluted the Princess with a great deal
of respect, and the Prince of Salernoes old Governor delivered her a letter
written to her from his Master; she read it with blushing, and though I
perceived a great deal of unquietness in the Painters face, yet was I persuaded
that only the interest which he seemed to have in the Prince of Salerno, or the
fear he was in lest he should be forced to quit the Princesses service, was the
cause of it. After the reading of this letter I knew by her discourse that it
was a proposition of marriage, and a declaration of love. She said to the
Princes Messenger, that his Master did her an honor which she was unworthy of.
And whereas this Governor would have enlarged himse^f upon the praises of his
Master, I know his virtue and his merit, replied she, and here you see one by
me, said the Princess, showing him the Prince of Salerno, who has drawn me his
picture, and I doubt not but it is very like him, since I can assure you that
he is one of the best Painters of the world. This gallanterie gave great hope
to the Prince of Salerno, and filled the mind of Don Fernando with despair. In
the mean time the Princess told the Princes Messenger, that he should have her
answer the next day, and then commanded her Officers to have a care of him, and
to conduct him to the lodgings where strangers were entertained. They were no
sooner gone, but the Prince of Salerno making use of the liberty which the
Princesses goodness gave to all her servants when she was in private. I rightly
foresavv, Madam, said he unto her, that the Prince of Salerno would not make me
change my Mistress. For my part, said Don Fernando interrupting him, and
addressing his speech to the Princess, with an intention to use a trick for the
destroying of the Prince of Salernoes designs (whom he did not imagine was so
near him) I think I should betray my duty, and be wanting to the fidelity which
I owe you, if seeing your happiness, or unhappiness concerned, I should not
tell you, that this Prince of Salerno is nothing less than what you are told he
is. Do you know him, demanded the Painter of him with a great deal of coldness?
I have seen him an hundred times, replied he, during three months space that I
was at Naples; he would have had me live with him, after I had taught him some
Spanish Aires, but having been acquainted with the fantasticallness of his
humor, I would not serve him. Besides, Madam, this Prince is neither rich, nor
powerful in his Country, in such manner as one would make you believe; and I
wonder how he should be so hardy, as to extend his ambition so far as to you.
Permit me, Madam, said the Painter interrupting him, to clear my self of the
doubt wherein I am, and to ask of this enemy to the Prince of Salerno, whether
he be young, or old, and in what place they grew acquainted together? for as he
talks, I dare say he knows him him not. He is young, answered Don Fernando,
and that you may not think but that I know him, I assure you that I found him
the first time I savv him at Naples to have but a bad aspect, and to be very
uncomely in his behavior. The suspicion which I have will not end so soon,
replied the Painter, for if I had undertaken it, I could let her excellency
see, that he is not so unhandsom as you would make him to be. The Princess,
who had no interest in this dispute, nor apprehended that which the Painter
said, as he meant it, interrupted him, for to demand whether he could dravv
the picture of a person that was absent, and make it like him? Never doubt of
it, Madam, said he unto her. If you dravv that of the Prince of Salerno, said
Don Fernando, I am sure it will not resemble you, for indeed he is nothing so
handsome. You do me too much honor, ansvvered the Painter coldly; but to dravv
me out of the doubt wherein I am, tell me, who has informed you that the
Prince of Salerno is so fantastical? All his servants, replied the other, who
complained exceedingly of it. I vvonder at that, said the Painter; but who
has told you too, that he was not rich? All the people of Naples, ansvvered
the other, who are well acquainted with the disorders of his House; and then
again I perceived it well enough my self, for he gave me nothing for the
pains I took in teaching him to sing. It is not his custom to be so sparing,
ansvvered the Painter; But tell me yet, who served him at that time? This old
Governor which you saw but now, was he with him? What were his recreations?
what was his delight? what was his employment? I think I did not see that man
about him, answered Don Fernando, and for his Master, I found him so little
worthy of esteem, that I did not observe him; howsoever I am very sure that he
is not considerable at all, either in the Court of Spain, or with the Viceroy.
I see no likelyhoood, replied the Painter, for one to believe that the Emperor
and the Viceroy have entertained you with these matters, whilst you were
playing on the Violl. There is yet less, said the Musician, that they should
tell you the contrary of that which I affirm, whilst you were besmearing of
walls. Ah! Madam, said the Painter interrupting him, permit me to punish the
lying and malice of this impostor, who dares traduce a man so insolently, whom
certainly he does not know, and a Prince too, who cannot be absolutely without
merit, since he is capable of the design to serve you; He has been my Master,
and is now your servant, pardon me then if for your sake I lose the respect
which is due unto you. Do not you fear, said the Princess unto him, that Don
Fernandoes speeches shall ever hurt the Prince of Salerno; neither doubt you,
that this noble ardor which you show in maintaining his party shall displease
me, but contrarily I shall esteem of you the more for it; and I forbid Don
Fernando from ever speaking of that Prince but with respect; but withal I
charge you not to remember what he has said, and command both of you once more
to live lovingly together. The Painter wholly filled with hope, rendered thanks
to the Princess; and the Musician not able to do otherwise, got him away
as soon as the Princess was entered into her Cabinet, with a purpose to answer
the letter which she had received from the Prince of Salerno: Who being
vvithdravvn in private, and reflecting on Don Fernandoes boldness in
maintaining of a lie, and on all that had past betwixt them, he no longer
doubted but that he was a man of quality, whom, the same reason which had
made him a Painter, had made a Musician. Coming then to look on Don Fernando,
as on his Rival, he had an hundred times a mind to discover himself unto him,
that he might oblige him to fight with him; but this first sense of revenge
and jealousy being over, he knevv it would ruin his design; For He
considered, that if the Princess answer to him was favorable, he should have
time enough to be revenged; and if it were not, that then he should discover
himself to ill purpose, and deprive himself of the means of executing that
which he had premeditated; he resolved then to make a show, in case the
Princess ansvver'd rigorously, of having forgotten what had past, with an
intent to live very civilly with Don Fernando, to the end that conversing
often with him, and observing al his actions, he might not be prevented by
him, Don Fernando on his side believed, after he had well thought upon it,
that this Painter had been sent by the Prince of Salerno to speak well of him
to the Princess before he declared himself, knowing well enough that she
permitted not the entrance of any person of quality into Monaco; and in this
thought he purposed likewise to observe him very carefully. In the mean time,
the Princess sent the next morning for the Prince of Salernoes messenger to
receive his answer, where the Painter, and the Musician were also present,
having thrust themselves amongst those which conducted this Messenger to her.
The Princess, in giving him her letter, prayed him to assure his Master, that
she should be eternally obliged to him for the honor he had done her; that she
besought him to believe, that though she did not grant him that which he
desired of her, yet could it not be termed a refusal, since she refused him
nothing but what she could not grant him; that she owed that respect to the
ashes of her father, as not to violate that faith which she had given by his
commandment; and that being thus no longer her own, he was not to take it ill,
if she assured him that she could never be his; that nothing resting in her
power, but the esteem of him and his friendship, she assured him both of the
one and the other, and of an acknowledgement that should last as long as her
life. This obliging refusal assuaged not the Prince of Salernoes grief, who
himself heard his own sentence pronounced; nevertheless he had reason enough
left to use his uttermost endeavor to conceal it, for fear he should be
suspected of the Princess. As for Don Fernando, the joy which he testified for
this adventure was so great, as the Painter was the more confirmed in the
opinion which he had. After the Prince of Salernoes Messenger was gone, and
that the Princess had given him a diamond of great value, and that she had
commanded him to be conducted to the Barque, which was to carry him back to
his Vessel, the Painter craved leave of he, that he might accompany him with
the rest, for he durst not speak to him, said he, unless it pleased her to
permit him. You are discreet, said the Princess, and this respect merits more
than this which you demand of me. The Painter having obtained this permission,
went and overtook his Governor, to salute hm; this man, who was instructed as
he ought, used him like a Painter, and dexterously giving him the commodity to
talk with him, this Prince willed him to return unto Villa-Franco, under
pretext of mending something about his vessel, and to send the Master of his
Horse the next morning disguised unto him, with as much money as as he could
bring. Now you are to understand, that the day before he happened to meet and
know an old Soldier, which sometime had born arms under his Father, and whose
life he had saved, being at that time Sergeant of one of the Companies of the
Garrison. The Prince of Salerno comeing to know him, found the means to speak
with him in private, and after he had given him three hundred pistolets, he
made himself known unto him. This man ravished to see the Son of his old
Master, but more yet with his liberality, testified after his manner, both his
acknowledgement, and his joy. In the mean time the Prince of Salerno, who had
not made himself known unto him only to enrich him, told him how he was to
serve him in a business that concerned all his happiness. This man told him, that
he was his subject, and his obligee, so that consequently he might expect any
thing from him. Then the Prince asked him, whether he lived alone in his house,
and having learn: that he did, he asked of him further, whether he could not
suborn a Fisherman with money; this Soldier having answered him, that the
poverty of those kind of people did not permit him to doubt but that he should
find out an hundred in stead of one, he gave him wherewithal to gain him,
without discovering any part of his design unto him, assuring him only that
this Fisherman should be exposed to no peril, nor have ought else to do, than
to carry his nets: That which made the Prince of Salerno do thus, was, for that
he had observed how just at ten of the clock in the forenoon the ordinary Guard
still used to rise, and thereby had conceived, that they which saw a Fisherman
go forth laden with his nets about nine, would not be there at five in the
evening, and so consequently he might come in again accompanied with two men
attired like Fishermen, and laden with nets a^ he was, without any notice taken
of them. After he had reasoned thus with himself, he resolved to execute that
which he had premeditated long before, judging rightly by the answer which the
Princess had given his Messenger, that nothing but violence could put him in
possession of her. This design being absolutely concluded, he sought for the
means to execute it. This Sergeant brought him a Fisherman into a place apart,
whom he instructed with that which he would have him to do; and the next day
this man went out of the Town about eight of the clock in the morning laden
with nets, and (as I have already said) before the Guard was risen; but when it
was toward evening, he gave over fishing, and went to meet with two Soldiers
disguised like Fishermen, who came by Land from the Prince of Salerno's
Vessel, which was at Villa-Franco, and waited for him at a certain Rendezvous
which had been appointed him: Having shared his nets amongst them, he re-entred
into the Town, and incountring none of those soldiers at the Gate which had
seen him in the morning, no notice was taken of them, and so they went along
with him home; where they stayed till it was night, and then these two men
having left their nets there, were conducted by him to the Sergeants house, in
which they abode concealed until the Prince of Salerno had need of them. By
this device there entered every day two soldiers into the Town, who carried two
Pistolls and two short swords hidden in the nets, wherevvith they were laden.
But whereas there was to be thirty days before the threescore soldiers,
which he had destined for his enterprise, could enter, he was in an extreme
impatience; howbeit he concealed it so well, as we could never perceive it.
In the mean time he had gotten him a ladder of cords, vvherevvith he purposed
to bring a dozen soldiers into the Castle thorough the vvindovvs of his
chamber, which opened upon a place where no body usually passed, and where no
body could trouble his design; for upon the disorder which had been between him
and the Musician, they had been lodged assunder. For the rest of his Soldiers,
he had resolved to send them under the conduct of the Master of his house, and
that Sergeant, to the gate of the Town, for to render themselves Masters of it,
whilst he should carry the Princess away by force, for which effect his Vessel
was to be at the Port. But whilst he attended for the entrance of all his
soldiers, and that Don Fernando also attended the return of him from whom he
hoped for succor in his enterprise, they lived better together than ever they
had done, and in show they loved one another extremely, though indeed they
hated and observed one another as two enemies. As for Don Fernando, he had
(during the design which he kept close) fallen into a strict league of
friendship with one of the principal Inhabitants of Monaco, whom the Princess
had made Captain of the Gate. His first admittance into this man's house, was to
teach his only daughter to sing, afterward his conversation grew so pleasing
unto him, as he frequented thither very often, and so they came to love one
another exceedingly. Don Fernando, in the thought which he was in, turned his
eyes upon this Captain, and having heard him say diverse times, that the people
began to murmur against the Princess, for that it seemed she had resolved all
her lifetime to make a desert of Monaco, and utterly to ruin the trade
thereof, by the difficulty which there was of entering into it, he resolved to
confide in him, as he hid, after he had blinded him first with a great sum of
money, which he gave him. And that which made him not doubt but that the
Gentleman, whom he had sent, would bring him Troops, was, because he knew the
Armies of Spain were very powerful in Italy, and that if he could once render
himself Master of this place, she should not only be justified, but quickly
succored; the Council of Spain never wanting pretexts to invade the
territories of their Neighbors, when as they find occasion for it. During this
expectation, the Princess had had her unqu etness, as well as her Lovers; for
that Lieutenant of her Guard, whom she had sent to seek you, seemed too long to
her in returning: and whereas she had made it a secret, I was she alone to whom
she complained of it; Nevertheless one of her women chancing upon a day to
overhear somewhat confusedly what she said unto me, believed that you were
suddenly to return, and her joy was so great for it, as she told this false
news to all the Princes Officers, who quickly acquainted the Painter and
Musician with it, never dreaming that they would be otherwise concerned in it
than to rejoice at it as they cid. Howbeit this news wrought an other effect,
for thereupon both the one and the other of them hastened the finishing of the
designs they had in hand. They wondered notwithstanding to see that that which
it seemed should have made the Princess glad, should render her so melancholy
as she would scarce see the Prince of Salerno paint any more, nor hear Don
Fernando sing any longer: But I found a means to make her change her
resolution; for calling to mind two songs, which you had made for the Princess,
I got Don Fernando to learn them; and that he might take more care in singing
of them, I told him whose they were, and for whom they were made, for fear his
negligence should cause the Princess to hate him. I marked well that he blushed
when I propounded this unto him; but whereas I have always been ingenious in
finding out reasons to deceive my self, I was yet more ^n this occasion; and I
believed that only the spite of being obliged to sing the Airs which he
himself had not made, was the cause of his choler, and in this error I
continued even unto the end. For when he had learned these Aires, after they
had been repeated unto him above twenty times, yet did he not sing them very
well: Nevertheless the Princess would hear no other thing, howsoever I
entreated her to the contrary; so that Don Fernando was thereby reduced to that
point, as he could not see the Princess unless he would sing his Rivalls songs:
Which he did with so much constraint, as he made me to laugh at him; For still
I was persuaded that he did it out of caprichiousness and pride, though indeed
it was out of jealousy. As for the Prince of Salerno, another adventure befell
him. When as there lacked but two days of the time wherein all his Soldiers
were to come in, the Princess remembered how she had heard him say, that he
could draw the picture of one that was absent, that should be like him, and
thereupon believed that by the instructions which she could give him he might
peradventure draw a picture that would resemble you, though he had never seen
you. She propoundes the matter unto him, assures him that he shall infinitely
oblige her if he can do it; and though she told him not precisely who the
person was that she desired the picture of, yet he knew that undoubtedly it was
yours which she would have. At first he said, that he believed he could not do
it; but after he had thought on it a little, I will endeavor, Madam, said he
unto her laughing, to content you, provided you will have the goodness not to
entreat me as an ordinary Painter, and that you will acknowledge unto me, after
you have seen it, that it is the picture of the man, who of all the world
honors you with most respect, and loves you with most passion. You know too
much for a Painter, said the Princess unto him blushing, howsoever I will
pardon you this boldness, and will acknovvledge that unto you which you say,
provided you presently go in hand with your work. The Painter having for
answer made a love obeisance, went to fetch a cloth and colors for him to
work in her chamber. When he was arrived there the Princess would have had a
great glass taken away, which hung right opposite to the place where he had
seated himself, for fear the Sun which gave full upon it, should mar it; But
he prayed her that it might not be removed, because as he said, it served to
ease his sight. The Princess then began to describe you as you are, and
particularising unto him all the features of your face as well as possibly she
could, she thought she had instructed him sufficiently. Whereupon he began to
design this picture, and pausing at every draught that he made, as it were to
recollect his memory, at length he traced our all the rest. And after the
Princess had caused him to alter something, she professed that it was very near
to the same which she desired; but for fear he had forgo^ten what she had
already told him, she represented unto him again the color of your hair, of
your eyes, and of your complexion. Then he took his palet, and his pencills,
and tricked the picture, which certainly resembled you a little, but less than
when it was only traced out with the cole. The Princess mervelled hereat;
and knevv not whereunto she might attribute the cause of it; for considering
every feature in particular, she savv that little lacked but they were just as
she had figured them, and yet for all that the whole put together scarce
resembled you at all. But the Painter nothing abashed at it, told her that it
was but a tricking, and past his word unto her, that the first time he should
touch it he would bring it to that pass, as it would be impossible for her
not to know in this picture the most faithful of her Lovers. The day
following the Painter came again into the Princesses chamber by her order, and
seated himself in the same place where he sat before. The Princess instructed
him again, and he making shovv of harkening very attentively unto her, beheld
himself in that glass which hung before him; but the more he wrought, the
less did this picture resemble you, though she could not well say where the
fault of it was. She made him touch the eyes again, alter something about the
mouth, and so of all the other features; and though he seemed exactly to obey
her, yet kept he still from the Princess design. And this shadow of Justiniano
which appeared in this picture was defaced at every stroke that he gave,
although he seemed to use his uttermost endeavor carefully to follow the
Princes directions. And when she testified to the Painter the unquietness she
was in for it, he told her, that to judge well of a picture, one was not to
look upon it whilst it was a doing, and to discern the faults the better of
that which he was about, she was to let him work an hour upon it without
looking on him. The Princess believed him, and taking me away with her to the
other end of the chamber, we left him alone; but we were much amazed, when he
had advertised us that his work was done, and that he had brought it into the
light for us to judge the better of it, to see that it was his own picture
which he had drawn, and not yours. The Princess then perceived plainly, that
this was not a matter of chance, and in an instant calling to mind so many
things, as she had seen without thinking of them, she made no doubt but that
there was somewhat, which was mysterious enough in this adventure; Yet had she
sufficient constancy of mind not to show all her amazement, and to take from
the Painter the means of discovering himself further; I well foresaw, said she
unto him with a seeming simplicity, that this glass would make you spoil your
work; And I am very sorry, continued she, going toward her Cabinet, that you
have lost your time, and I too. If this picture, said the Prince of Salerno, in
following her two or three steps, does not resemble the most passionate of your
Lovers, I with all my heart renounce the profession which I make. Take heed,
answered the Princess, that my anger becomes not as strong, as your presumption
is great. Madam, said he unto her, retayning her by the Gown, I am not so
faulty as I seem to be, and to justify my self in some sort to you, I must
tell you, that I have no other design in drawing this picture, than to let you
see that the Prince of Salerno is not so ugly as Don Fernando has described
him unto you; For by a strange chance, I resemble him so near, as I might well
be taken for him: And that I may not conceal all the truth from you, continued
he, I will confess to you, that it is by his consent that I am here at Monaco,
that it is to speak to you of his affection, that thus I cast my self at your
feet, most humbly entreating you to believe, that no man ever adored you with
more respect. Answer then, Madam, I beseech you, but not with fury, to the end
that that faithful Lover may show himself to you. Under what form soever the
Prince of Salerno may present himself, he shall always receive the same
entertainment from me; my resolutions do not easily change; and should he lay
all the Crowns of the world at my feet, yet should I refuse him as now I do;
But as for you, said she unto him, I shall know how to use you as you ought to
be, and I am very much deceived if you talk to me long of loves. After this the
Princess retired without attending his answer. For my part, I profess unto you
that I was so astonished at this adventure, as I could not speak. Howsoever I
followed the Princess into her Cabinet, and respect obliged the Prince of
Salerno to go out of her chamber, conceiving rightly by the manner wherewith he
was ansvvered, that his persuasions would obtain nothing. That which made him
carry himself thus, and to use this dangerous gallantery, was, that being upon
the point of executing his design, he would have been glad to have found an
occasion to see, whether he could not by fair means have prevailed with the
Princess, without having recourse unto violence; and whereas his men were ready
for the action, he feared not the hazarding of the matter; and then again the
love which he bore to the Princess was so strong, as he was resolved to perish,
or possess her. In the mean time the Princess and I knew not what to think, nor
what to resolve; and she demanding my advice about it, I knew not what to
answer her. What think you of it, Aemilia, said she unto me? This Painter, has
he lost his respect, or his reason? Is he an impostor, or a Prince? For my
part, Madam, said I unto her, I cannot tell what to say to you of it; he has
had patience enough for a Prince, in the abode that he has made here, and in
the disputes which he has had with Don Fernando; But it must be acknowledged
also that he has too much wit, and too much boldness for a Painter. Whatsoever
he is, said the Princess, he shall not stay in Monaco. Madam, said I unto her,
I am even of your mind, Prince or Painter, Lover or Enemy, it is fit he should
be gone; But if by chance he be the latter, it should be done without
ill-intreating him, for truly the loving you is no such great crime: And if it
be the Prince of Salerno, he is more unhappy than faulty, and more worthy of
your pity than of your indignation. I am of a contrary opinion, said the
Princess unto me, for if he be a Prince, I look upon him as a dreadful enemy;
But if he be a senseless Painter, he is unworthy of my anger, and his folly may
beget compassion in me. We reasoned in this manner all the evening, without
being able to judge certainly whether this Painter were the Prince of Salerno,
or some one of his servants whom he had sent to be about the Princess, howbeit
we believed him to be rather the first than the other: And after we had
examined the matter, it was resolved that this Painter should the next day be
turned out of Monaco, without letting him know that he was suspected to be a
Prince, and also without any other ill usage, than banishing him. With this
intention the Princess went to bed, and would have me lie with her that night,
it being impossible for her, as she said, to have any hope of sleeping, as long
as you should have a Rival in Monaco. Whilst the Princess and I were agitating
in this sort, the Prince of Salerno, who had found that all his hope consisted
wholly in force, resolved to defer his design no longer, and to execute it the
night ensuing; he went then to seek out that Sergeant with whom he held
intelligence, and to speak with the Master of his horse, to the end his vessel
might not fail to be at the Port just at the hour which he had appointed, and
that he should deal in such sort, as all might be ready against need should be.
He gave them the time and the signal of the enterprise, and thinking that he
had well disposed of every thing, he retired into the Castle as he used to do,
taking but two pistolls and a sword along with him, which he carried secretly
into his chamber, in case any violence should be offered him before his design
could be executed. If the Prince of Salerno was busied, no less was Don
Fernando; For he had understood some days before, by the return of him whom he
had sent into the Milanese, that according to his, and the Marquis of Guasts
directions, he had brought him store of money and jewels, together with five
hundred men, which were come thither not in a body, but two and two in a
company, and so were lodged in all the Villages about Monaco, with express
order to render themselves all upon a certain night, whereof they should be
advertised, within a mile of the Town; So that Don Fernando stayed for nothing
but the return of the Captain of the Gate, who was gone to Genoua, and whose
faith he had corrupted. This man, for our ill fortune, or to say better for our
good fortune, came back as he desired, so that the next morning, which was the
very same day wherein this Painter finished the picture that resembled you so
ill, he went and found him out, and having given him to the value of ten
thousand crowns in jewels, he confirmed him by this liberality in the design
he had undertaken. But not to prolong my discourse, it suffices that I tell
you, how after he had discovered himself to this man to be that he was a good
while before; after he had persuaded him, that the retiredness wherein the
Princess lived, would in the end undo Monaco; because, said he, it was
impossible, having no Prince to defend it, but that some one or other would
seize upon it; after he had told him, that this place was too important, for to
be left undefended under the Government of a maid; and that seeing it was to
pass into the hands of strangers, he was to desire that it might fall into the
power of a man, who would be obliged to him for it, and that was able to make
his fortune. After all these things, I say, this man charmed with the present
benefit, with the hope of what was to come, and believing too that it would be
somewhat advantageous for the Princess, he promised Don Fernando, who
communicated his whole design unto him, to deliver him the Gate whenever he
pleased. Hereupon he sent that Gentleman, which belonged unto him, to carry his
directions to all the several places where his soldiers were, to the end they
should precisely meet together within a mile of Monaco an hour after midnight,
and that they should repair to the gate of the Town as soon as they could see a
flaming Torch on a Tower. The strangeness of this encounter was, that the very
same night wherein the Prince of Salerno was to execute his design, Don
Fernando resolved, without knowing ought of his Rivalls affairs, no longer to
defer his interprize, purposing to die, or to render himself Master of the
Town, and possessor of the Princess: so that whilst we were all the afternoon
seeing the Prince of Salerno paint, he had been taking order for all things as
well as the Captain of the Gate. Their designs being in these terms. You make
me tremble with astonishment, said Justinianio, interrupting Aemilia. You will
have yet more, continued she, when I shall tell you, that just about two hours
after midnight, which by an extraordinary chance proved to be the very point,
both of the Prince of Salerno's and Don Fernando's enterprise; that first
having caused twelve soldiers to enter thorough the window of his chamber with
the help of a lader of cords, and commanded the Sergeant to go and seize upon
the Gate of the town, that he might forcibly carry away the Princess in his
Vessel, which was to be at the Port at the same hour, we heard the outward
chamber door broke open; whereupon the Princess gave a great skrike, and
without standing to know what the matter should be, the first thing that
came into her thought was to put on her clothes, to the end she might not be
found in bed, wherein I helped her with all the speed that possibly I could.
In the mean time her women cried out at the windows, but the Princesses
Officers lay in a quarter so far of, because she never feared any thing from
the Towns side, and the Prince of Salerno's execution was so sudden, as
scarcely had the Princess gotten on a Night-govvn with much have, but he
entered into her chamber followed by ten soldiers, having left two at the
Castle-gate, who had stabbed the Porter upon his awaking. I leave you to think
what the Princess became in this occasion, when as maugre her resistance and
mine, maugre her tears, and maugre her cries, she saw her self carried away
forcibly, by these soldiers, and led out of the Castle. I can endure no more,
said Justiniano, with as much grief, and almost as much choler as if he had
seen his Mistress carried away by force. Have patience, said Aemilia, for yet
you do not see all our Enemies. When as the Prince of Salerno had forcibly
carried away the Princess, I followed her all in tears, and catching fast hold
of one of the corners of her gown, we went in this sort even to the Gate of the
Town, neither the Princess nor I having the power to cry out, so much were we
seized with fear, and our judgments troubled. The Prince of Salerno found not
the matter so easy as he had believed it; for the Sergeant, who had gotten the
Ward, and that was to make use of it for the surprising of the Court of Guard,
and cutting them in pieces, arrived just at the gate, as the Captain that
served Don Fernando, was delivering it up to his men, who were come thither
under the conduct of the Gentleman which belonged unto him, after they had seen
the Signal on the Tower. And whereas he had order to dye, or to render himself
Master of it, what resistance soever he met withal, he had already begun a
sharp and bloody sight, when as the Prince of Salerno, and those that kept the
Princess, arrived at that place. And being a Prince of a great courage, after
he had commanded his ten soldiers to look well to the Princess, he went with
his sword in his hand to see what the matter was. Never was there any thing
more dreadful than that same night; Don Fernando, who lay not in the Castle
that night, who was ready at the gate to receive in his men, and who was in the
head of them, when as the Sergeant arrived there, thought he was discovered,
and so did likewise the Captain of the gate; the Prince of Salerno incountring
so great a number of Enemies, could not tell what to imagine; and the darkness
of the night augmenting this disorder yet more, there was one of the greatest
conflicts that has been seen; for in this confusion they killed on both sides
without knowing one another. In the mean time the alarm being taken up
throughout the whole Town, and the bruit spread abroad that the Princess was
forcibly carried away, all the Troops repaired to the place of arms, and all
the people put themselves into a posture of succouring us. And whereas it was
easy to discern on which side the Enemies were, the Prince of Salerno saw
himself quickly enclosed both without and within; but first he came twice or
thrice to the place where his Soldiers guarded us, to see in what estate the
Princess was. And when he perceived by the abundance of people, which came
running from all parts, that it would be impossible for him to finish his
enterprise, he came o^ce more unto her. I will dye, Madam, said he unto her,
seeing I cannot possess you; But first know, for the rendering of my memory the
less odious unto you, that after I have fought to carry you away, I go now to
fight for to keep you from being carried away by Don Fernando, and the Prince
of Salerno being unable to live for you, will dye at leastwise in defending
you. This discourse surprising the Princess; What said she, have we more
Enemies than one? This while the Prince of Salerno, who notwithstanding the
darkness of the night, having observed that Don Fernando was in the Head of the
Troops which he fought withal, called him so often by his name, that at
length they met together, and entered so furiously into a particular combat, as
losing the care of their men, it was the easier for them of the Garrison, and
the people, who were all up in arms, to defeat them. The treacherous Captain
labored in vain to put Don Fernandoes people into order; and the Prince of
Salernoes Master of his Horse, and the Sergeant, whom he made use of, opposed
themselves also in vain to the disorder of theirs. The confusion increased with
the number; The Princesses Troops augmented still; those of the Enemies
diminished every moment; And whereas her voice was heard at last by some of her
servants notwithstanding the fearful noise that was made, they which guarded
us having marked it, and seeing above an hundred men come from diverse parts
upon them, they abandoned us after some small resistance, and that they had
showed a great deal of care of not exposing the Princess to any danger, as the
Prince had expressly charged them. They had no sooner left us the liberty which
they had taken from us, but the Princess, seeing herself in the hands of her
own People, got into the nearest house, and appointing Soldiers for the guard
of it, she commanded they should send her word how things stood, and that if it
were possible they should not kill the two Heads of the Enemies forces. In the
mean time the Prince of Salernoes Soldiers, which had abandoned the Princess,
went amidst the press to seek out their Master for to advertise him of it, and
having by chance found him still in fight with Don Fernando, they told him
confusedly that the Princess was carried away. This discourse equally surprised
them both. The Prince of Salerno believed that Don Fernandoes men had done it,
who on the other side knew not what to think of it: At the same instant so
great throng of people pressed in amongst them, as they lost one another in the
crowd; and each of them seeking to be cleared in this matter, they got out of
the Town spite of the obstacles which they met with at the Gate, whereof the
three parties had been Masters more than once. I cannot repeat all this sight
unto you; but at length the Princesses people fought with such courage, as they
killed very near all the Prince of Salernoes and Don Fernandoes Soldiers. And
when it appeared that there were no more enemies in the Town, they shut up the
Gate; Part of the Garrison and of the inhabitants, having in the mean time
pursued and made an end of defeating them, returned into Monaco. Hereupon the
Prince of Salerno having certainly understood, that the Princess had not been
carried away by Don Fernando (for we learnt so much by certain Soldiers) and
seeing that he was hurt, that it was impossible for him to do more, and that he
had lost his Rival in the press, he resolved to get to his Vessel. As for Don
Fernando he found himself yet in a stranger condition, all his Soldiers having
been well near slain, or fled away whilst he was fighting with the Prince of
Salerno, he beheld himself almost alone, covered over with wounds, and not
knowing what to do, having no Vessel to facilitate his flight by Sea, nor any
security on Land for him, with so little company. It is credible, considering
what I have said, that seeing himself in that estate, and perceiving that the
Prince of Salerno, followed by some of his men, made toward the port, he with
his Soldiers mingled amongst them, and entered into his Vessel with him; the
darkness of the night favoring the design, which doubtless he had to kill the
Prince of Salerno, and to make himself master of his Vessel. For when the day
began to break there was a great noise heard on the Port side, which made every
one to get up on the walls for to see what the matter was. The Princess and I
went up to the top of the lodgings where we were, which looked upon the Sea,
and whereas it was grown very light, we saw a Vessel, that was making from the
Port, and on the hatches a great number of men fighting together, whereof some
tumbled alive into the Sea, and others fell down dead at their enemies feet. In
the midst of this disorder we knew the Prince of Salerno and Don Fernando by
their apparel, who combated with such violence, as moved the Princess to
compassion, but at length, the Vessel still getting further of, we saw that
after a long combat these two Rivalls remained fighting almost alone, and
presently after both of them tumble down upon the hatches; and so on an instant
the Vessel vanishing, we could no longer discern those two courageous Lovers,
who more happy in this sad adventure, than they were aware of, made the
Princess shed tears of pity; but she shed them abundantly, when as in her
return unto the Castle she beheld so great a number of dead bodies as the
streets were even covered with them. The Prince of Salernoes Master of his
horse was found living still, as well as he whom Don Fernando had sent into the
Milanese; and it was by their means that we came to learn the particularities
of this History, which without them I could not have told you; for the Princess
understanding who they were, caused them to be very carefully looked unto, that
she might learn that which I have related. The Captain of the Gate, and the
traitorous Sergeant were found amongst the number of the dead, and as if the
Prince of Salernoes Master of his horse, and Don Fernandoes Agent, had
prolonged their lives but only to tell the Princess what she desired to know,
they dyed within a few days of their hurts. As for their Masters we heard
afterward, that being fallen down as it were dead, in the manner as I have
told you, the remainder of the Prince of Salernoes men having made an end of
killing those which had followed Don Fernando de Mendoza; and believing their
Master to be dead, three or four of them took up the body of Don Fernando for
to cast it into the Sea, when as the Prince of Salerno coming out of his
svvoon, and seeing what they were going to do, recovered so much strength as
to forbid them from it; generosity being greater in him than hatred, or
revenge. This commandment of the Prince was executed, and that too of seeing
whether he had any life remaining in him; and when it was reported unto him
that he still breathed, he charged them to have as much care of him as of
himself; as indeed he was looked unto and treated in the same manner. I vvil
not declare the conversations of these two Rival unto you, but in brief it
suffices to let you know, that the Prince of Salernoes generosity so nearly
touched the heart of Don Fernando, as he ceased to hate him, and would needs
land with him at Naples to be thoroughly cured there. And as if on the healing
of their wounds that of their minds had depended, they surmounted the love
which they bare to the Princess, the first out of reason, and the other out of
his pride. And each of them following his own sense, they sent to the Princess,
and wrote unto her, the last with rhodomontades, according to the humor of his
Nation, and the other with a great deal of civility; beseeching her to remember
that she had promised her friendship to the Prince of Salerno, and praying her
also to attribute all that had past to the passion of the Painter Lucilio, and
not to him, who vowed always to seek occasions to serve her, and to publish
every where, that she was the admirablest creature on the whole earth. The
Princess answered with much discretion both to the one and to the other; and in
this sort ende^^ the adventure, which she would not recount unto you, and which
possessed me with so much fear, that though it be now three months since it
happened, I am not yet well recovered of it. Justiniano thanked Aemilia for the
pains she had taken, commended her wit and her address; and after he had ended
th^s complement, he saw the Princess come out of her Cabinet, who having heard
Justiniano talk, judged rightly that Aemilia had finished her relation. This
faithful Lover no sooner saw her, but he complained for that she would have
concealed an adventure from him, where things had past, which heaped glory and
confusion on him; how it was almost as much as to say, that she repented the
having of too advantageous thoughts for him, in that she would not have let him
have known them; but she answered him very obligingly, that the remembrance of
others misfortunes always touched her so sensibly, when as she esteemed
herself the cause of them, as she thought she should render herself guilty of
those of the Prince of Salerno and of Don Fernando de Mendoza, if she should
hear them without grief, and that having desired to avoid all occasions that
might bring her to a sense of sadness, in a time when she had the pleasure to
see him, she had withdrawn herself. In this sort it was that Isabella
entertained Justiniano, who ordered the conversation so dexterously, as he bad
the Princess good night, without her pressing him to acquaint he^ with the end
of his History.

IBRAHIM: OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The second part. The fourth BOOK.
WHEN as Juctiniano was retired to his lodging, and that he had commanded his
servants to leave him alone, after they had got him to bed, his imagination
represenred unto him more lively, than ever it had done before, the
inconsideration of his voyage; the promise he had made to Soliman to return
unto him; the necessity, either of breaking his word with a prince who had so
much obliged him, or to quit his Mistress: Alas! said she, how unhappy am I,
and how imprudent have I been? what shall I do in so deplorable an estate? What
shall I say to the Princess? Wherefore came I to Monaco? Had I the design to
betray her, in coming to marry her, and then to steal away from her the very
next day? Or have I past my word for to falsify it? No, no, that was not my
design; I desired to see Isabella, my love carried me unto it, and doubtless it
ought to carry me unto it; and were I to dispose of my self again, I should
still do the same thing. And could I, said he alowd, refuse to see Isabella?
Then turning himself about with precipitation, he recommenced his complaints.
What, continued he, did I come to the Princess, only to acquaint her that I was
Grand Vizier; that I was the chief of all the Orient; that I was the Favorite
of a great Prince; and afterward to abandon her to grief and despair, and so
return again to enjoy all those greatnesses? Ah no, Justiniano is not base; he
will not quit a Princess, who is not unhappy but for the love of him; he will
not sacrifise her so cruelly to the pleasure of a Prince, who may find men
enough in his Empite, that will take the place which he held there; For in
fine, if Soliman loves us, this princess loves us too; and if I have friendship
for this Prince, I have love for Isabella. Let us not balance the matter any
longer, let us enjoy the good we have, and let us not destroy our selves:
Whereupon he thought that he had found some rest, but on a sudden a sense of
honor coming again into his mind, he went on passionately; Why, thou base man
(said he) can thou resolve to cover thy self with infamy? to break thy word
with one of the mightiest Princes of the world, and that has the most sensibly
obliged thee? And do thou believe that this generous Princess whom thou
servest, would think thee worthy of her affection after this baseness? Thou
deceivest thy self Justiniano, and with her own mouth she has pronounced thy
sentence: That which she has said of this Prince, the praises which she has
given him, makes me know but too well that she could not esteem one that should
betray him. But, continued he, if in this occasion honor should give place unto
love, yet would thou not find thy self at rest, since this love well
considered, will in this encounter have the same thing which honor requires:
See thou not (wretch as thou art) that this Prince whom thou would betray,
is the most rigorous observer of his word that is in the world? and that if
thou should fail in that which thou have given him, he is capable of coming
with an Army of an hundred thousand men, not only to undo thy Country, but
thy Mistress her self, as the cause of thy fault: Save her then from this
mischief, sacrifise thy self for her, and follow the Fate which will have thee
always unhappy. But will thou also deprive thy self for ever (said he further)
of the sight of Isabella? of the hope of thy possessing her, which is to say,
of all thy felicity, to render thy self the most unfortunate, and the most
desperate amongst men? Yes, I must resolve for it, and withal resolve to dye.
Have courage enough then, continued he, not to hide a thing from her which thou
can not conceal without baseness; speak then, wretched man: but how dare
thou tell her that thou art a Slave, that thou will abandon her, and that thou
preferrest thy word before thy love? No, that may not be, thou can not
consent unto it, and death has something sweeter than this woeful speech. But
again, added he further, will thou consent to the undoing of Isabella? and thou
that can not resolve to betray Soliman, will thou betray this Princess, by
disguising the truth unto her? Will thou be so inconsiderate, as to let her
mary a Slave: Ah, this thought is too unjust! No, no, be far from so bad a
design, do only that which thou ought to do, and leave the rest unto
fortune: let her entreat thee ill, let her persecute thee, let her pursue thee
every where, it imports not, so as thou do nothing contrary to that which
thou owe to Isabella. It was in this manner that Justiniano agitated in his
mind so difficult a thing to resolve on; and honor and love tyrannized him so
cruelly, as his reason was almost lost therewith. But at length, after he had
past the greatest part of the night without sleeping, he generously resolved to
speak plainly to the Princess, and in this design pressed with weariness and
thought, sleep surprised him whether he would or no, or to say better, a dull
and melancholy vapor brought a senselesness upon him, which yet could not keep
his imagination from representing still unto him the deplorable condition
wherein he was. Day being come, he found himself so altered, as one would
hardly have believed, that the miseries of the mind could in so little a time
have brought such a notable change to the face. As soon as the Princess was in
an estate to be seen, she sent him a complement to advertise him of it,
whereupon he came straightway to her Cabinet, but with a countenance so pale,
and eyes wherein grief was so visible, as Isabella was surprised with it; But
whereas she did not believe that he had any cause to be afflicted, she thought
he was sick, told him that he should not have come out of his lodging in the
case he was in, asked him what he ailed? whether he had a fever? whether it
were still on him? and finally propounded very many questions unto him, whereto
Justiniano answered not a word. For upon the point of executing that which he
had resolved he felt so extraordinary a trouble in his mind, as he suddenly
past from paleness to redness; he was taken at first with an universal
shivering which made him to tremble, and then with so great a burning, that he
seemed all on fire. The Princess seeing him in this case, conjured him again
with more earnestness to acquaint her with the cause of all these alterations
in him, that they might labor to give some remedy unto it. Alas! Madam, (said
he unto her with somewhat a low voice, that he might not be heard by one of the
Princesses women, who was at the other end of the Cabinet) the knowledge which
I shall give you of my disease will not make you find a remedy for it; for it
is of a nature not to be cured, but by death. Yet if I should suffer it my self
alone, I would not complain of it; but I am afraid that it would be contagious
for you; that the knowledge which you should have of it would increase my grief
by causing yours; that I should be more unfortunate in your person, than in
mine own; and that in conclusion you would be yet more to be lamented than I,
who deserves the miseries which oppress me, since I am the cause of all yours.
The Princess judging rightly by this discourse, that there was some great
matter to be known, commanded her woman that was still in the Cabinet, to go
and stand at the door for to keep any from coming to interrupt her. This order
given, she turned back to Justiniano, and scarce knowing what to say, or what
to demand in so unexpected an occasion, she beheld him a while without
speaking, neither durst he likewise open his lips; but after she had
recollected her spirits, and knew that it concerned not the sickness of the
body, having a great and generous soul, she said unto him with a firm and
assured voice; What mark have you had, my dear Justiniano, of my little
affection, or of my weakness, that you fear so much to give me a part in your
griefs? No, no, cast off this fear, and permit me to tell you, before you
acquaint me with that which I can neither divine, nor comprehend, that besides
the loss of your affection, there is no misfortune wherein I shall not receive
some comfort, partaking it with you. Ah! Madam, said Justiniano interrupting
her, cease to be unjust in being too good to me, and believe that when you
shall know the point where at this present we are, you will find that I have
reason to be greatly troubled in resolving to acquaint you with it. Why, said
the Princess, exceedingly impatient, concerns it life, liberty, or honor? if it
be the first, provided I may die before you, I have felt sorrows sharper than
death; if it be the second, and that I may be a slave with you, I will accustom
my self to wear irons; but if it concerns honor, I confess that we have reason
to despair, and that to conserve it, any thing is to be done: you see, said she
unto him, that I am prepared for the greatest misfortunes, and for such as seem
to be the furthest off from me; hold me no longer then in pain, if it be true
that I have any power over you. Justiniano seeing he could not avoid it, went
on with his History from the point where he had left it, he recounted unto her
his pains, his unquietness, and his joys, when as he knew that she was not
inconstant; that not knowing what else to do, he had been constrained to
acquaint Soliman with his whole life; and consequently, that the permission
which he had obtained to come and see her was but for six months only, having
engaged his word to that Prince to return unto him precisely within that time.
Judge (after this, Madam, said he with sighs that well near suffocated him, and
that scarcely suffered him to speak) whether my complaints be not just, whether
I am worthy of your favor, and whether death alone be not the remedy which I
can find for my miseries. For consider (I beseech you) the pitiful estate
whereunto I am reduced; which way soever I turn me I see you still unfortunate,
but unhappy and unfortunate only for the love of me. Ah Madam! if you knew how
touching this object is, how sensible and grievous it is, you would easily
apprehend the evil that I suffer; it is so great, as there is no expression
strong enough to represent it well: You have believed me to be dead, and I have
thought that you were inconstant; your virtue has been tried by a long
absence, and my crime has been punished with slavery; but when as fortune
seemed to be weary of persecuting us, when as your constancy was sufficiently
known, and when as my crime was punished enough, she made some truce with us: I
knew that you lived for me, and you were not ignorant that I always lived for
you. I am returned Madam, but must I repeat it once again? I am returned a
Slave, fortune has but lengthened my chain, and not broken off my irons. You
seem, Madam, continued he, by your silence to tell me that I had done better
for your rest, not to have returned, and to have left you in the belief of my
death, than to come for to assure you that I do live, but that I do not live
for you. I think, Madam, that reason is on your side, but it is a reason which
I cannot follow. My voyage is not an effect of my reason, nor of my will; I
never stuck at the taking of this resolution, I followed my sense and my love,
and my passion so mightily blinded my reason, as my soul abandoned it self
wholly to joy. I no longer thought that I was to return again to
Constantinople, but only that I was going to Monaco, that I should have the
pleasure to see you there, and that afterward I could not be unhappy. In fine,
Madam, I have not done that which I ought, but I have done that which I could
not choose but do. In the mean time I have no sooner seen you, but I have
beheld you as a good which I was to lose, and as a person which I have made
unhappy. For Madam, if I break my word with Soliman, I am an infamous creature,
I shall put your State and your Honor in danger; and if I abandon you, I am
treacherous to you, and cruel to my self; and to say all, I am so unhappy as
death alone can succor me: But for all that Madam, it is you that must
pronounce my sentence, and dispose of my life. Justiniano then felt himself so
pressed with grief, as he could say no more. The Princess, who had heard him with
a great deal of attention, astonishment, and sorrow, was also a good while
without answering him; agitating in her self so difficult a thing to be
resolved. She was then leaning with one arm on a little table of ebony, looking
on Justiniano, who durst not lift up his eyes for fear of incountring those of
the Princess, which were full of tears; But at length this generous person,
who had a great and noble soul, brak off her silence, and said unto him with a
constancy, which has scarce any example; I confess, my dearest Jus^iniano,
that our miseries are so great, as I could not foresee them; and one had need
of a mind, that is firm indeed, not to be abandoned wholly to grief, i^ an
occasion where it is so hard to satisfy together, both honor and love: I
confess, continued she, that these two passions reign both at once in my heart;
but I confess also, that the last cannot be satisfied without the other; and
that in conclusion, to express my thought unto you, had I not found a means to
satisfy them both, I should die, and let you go. For know, that I am too
generous to suffer you to testify your love unto me in an unworthy way; and I
am ravished to see you love glory, as much as me. No, Justiniano, you must not
break your word with a Prince, who has so much obliged you; for so should you
be both ungrateful and perfidious; neither must you too abandon a Princess,
who loves you so dearly; for so should you be both cruel and unfaithful; and
if you love her perfectly, you can never do it. I know full well, answered
Justiniano with a deep sigh, that death alone can acquit me of that which I
ought to do. That is not my meaning, replied the Princess, and to clear it
unto you, you must return again to that generous Prince who has loved you so
much; I am no less obliged to him than you, since I ow your life unto him; and
for this reason, together with that of honor, I will no^ hinder you from it:
but withal you must permit me to follow you. Oh? Madam, said Justiniano, do
you think well of that you say? yes, answered she, I have though^ well upon it,
and am resolved for it. But whereas love can never vanquish honor in my soul, I
will not follow you as a vagabond, and forsaken one, you shall mary me here,
and that done, I will follovv your fortune over all the earth. You have told
me already, that Soliman permits you the exercise of your Religion, I may enjoy
the same grace, either as passing for your slave, or for your wife. And then
again, I have not forgotcen that you have told me, how this Prince has made
you hope, that if he could support your absence during the time of the six
months which he has given you, he would grant you your full liberty: Let us
go then, my dear Justiniano, and demand it of him with tears; Do not stain
your glory, in breaking your word with so excellent a Prince; and offend not
your love^ in refusing a request which I make to you with so much earnestness.
The generous discourse of the Princess had wrought strangely on Justiniano,
during the time that she spoke to him, though he left not harkening unto her;
and this proposition gave him a great deal of joy, though he meant not to
accept of it. And as if it had been a thing which he would deliberate of, he
had in an instant passed over in his mind all the reasons, which might either
carry him to it, or keep him from it. The first thoughts were without doubt a
pure effect of that passionate instinct, which will not have one abandon the
person beloved; but those that opposed them were altogether an effect of a
true love, of a clear-sighted reason, and of a secret jealousy. At first he
considered the dangers whereunto so dear a person might be exposed, either by
tempests, or by Pirates: But that which most troubled him, was, that knowing
how Soliman had a soul as amorous, as ever Prince had any, and remembering
withal, that he had been in passion for a picture which resembled Isabella a
little, he believed already that this monarch was his Rival; and by a moments
reflection, he fortified his reason so well, as he had generosity enough to
refuse a good, which was the uttermost term of his felicity. The Princess had
no sooner given over speaking, but beholding her which a little more confidence
than before. Must you, Madam said he unto her, surmount me in love, as well as
in greatness of courage? No, it would not be just. Leave me the only thing
whereunto I can pretend, and possess all the other virtues, wherein I can have
no part. I must in this occasion, Madam, show you, that Justiniano knows how
to love, and by the hardest trial that can be desired of a Lover; I will make
you see that my love considers nothing but you alone; that it is wholly
disinteressed; that I regard not my self; that in fine I am as perfect a Lover,
as you are generous. But this trial, ah how cruel it is! And how hard a
matter it is to refuse that which one desires! Yet it must be, and nothing can
distract me from it. To testify my love unto you then, Madam, at that height
which speak I of, I must not accept of the offer you make me; I must refuse to
mary you; I must abandon you; I must deprive my self of all my felicity; I must
fight with all my desires; I must destroy my self; and I must become the most
wretched of all men: Behold, Madam, all that I can, and all that I ought to do
for you; for to expose you to tempests, to the fury of Pirates, and to consent
that you should mary a slave, is a sacrilegious thought, which would render me
the most criminal person in the world, and which shall never arrive unto me.
It would be enough indeed for fortune to make me feel my own miseries, during
so fatal a voyage, without enforcing me to resent those which should happen to
you. Let me depart then, Madam, or to to say better, let me dye. I will do
neither the one, nor the other, said the Princess, and in this occasion you
shall not dispose of your self. Nevertheless it is needful that you should
give me a public act of your will, before I can execute mine. Resist me not,
Justiniano, unless you desire to offend me; suffer me to follow you with honor,
and put me not in the condition of increasing the number of those indiscreet
ones, who many times have followed their Lovers, without being their wives.
Think of my glory, I conjure you; and think too, that if you abandon me, I may
peradventure be capable of forgetting it. Do not expose me, I beseech you, to
that peril, since it is greater for me, according to my apprehensions, than
the dreadfullest tempest that you can describe unto me. And fear not I pray
you, continued she, either shipwreck, or Pirates; if we perish together, we
shall dye almost without grief; if we be made slaves, you will help me to bear
my chains; or if we be separated, the fury of those barbarians shall do no
more, than what you would now do. Cease, Madam, from adding to my sorrow, said
Justiniano interrupting her, complain of my misfortune, but complain not of me
in this cruel adventure. When I parted from Constantinople to come hither, I
blindly followed my passion; but at this present, Madam, I will blindly follow
reason: She will not have you follow a wretch, and an unfortunate man; Do you
not consider, how if it should happen that I should dye, in what an estate you
would remain? Ah! my dear Princess (if I may be permitted to call you so) give
over so woeful a design: Live in tranquillity, whilst I go and combat my evil
fortune at Constantinople; with a promise, if I cannot overcome it, not to
survive her victory very long. But it may be we shall not be so miserable;
Soliman has a great and virtuous soul; that which I am going to do may please
him; he may be moved with my tears and prayers; he may break that invisible
chain which ties me unto him; and being no longer a slave, you might then
without shame accord me the honor, which now I refuse. This hope is too weak,
said the Princess, to make me change the resolution I have taken: No,
Justiniano, to speak to me thus, is not to love as you should; this is to blind
me with an artifice, to doubt of my affection and courage, and to say all, this
is to offend me sensibly. My tears shall not hinder yours from having their
effect, but contrarily I am of a sex accustomed to vanquish even cruelty it
self with such like arms: Suffer me then to share this victory with you, if
you are to carry it; or that I may be vanquished with you, if you are to be so.
You do not consider, Madam, said Justiniano, that if Soliman should see you at
Constantinople, it would be the means of never obtaining my liberty, because I
should then have all there that could render me happy. The Princess stood a
whiles to answer so pressing a reason; But whereas her affection would not be
surmounted; May I not follow you, replied she, without being known, and under
the habit of a slave? No, Madam, you cannot, answered Justiniano; there is
something that is so great and so dazeling in your face, as you could not
conceal your self; But it is not for this reason alone, that I will not consent
thereunto; I love you, Madam, and that is to say all: I will keep my word then
with Soliman, since you do consent unto it, if it be true that I can absent my
self from you, without dying in despair: and all the grace which I demand of
you is, that you will not dispose of you^ self, until my return, or the news
of my death, have made you shed tears, either of joy or of grief. Ah! cruel
man, cried the Princess, cease to outrage my affection! Madam, answered
Justiniano, pardon a wretch, who not knowing how to hope, is capable of fearing
all things. Assure your self of my person, replied the Princess, for to assure
you of my constan^ie, and permit me to follow you in the manner that I have
told you. I may not, too generous Princess, said Justiniano, my love and my
reason will not suffer it. But suffices it not that I will have it so, replied
Isabella, for the obliging you to obey me? No, my Princess, it is not enough,
answered Justiniano, and my misery is arrived to that point, that I must for
the love of you oppose you; and I cannot acquit my self of all that I am owing
to you, but in disobeying you. The Princess then found herself so seized with
grief, as she remained a long time without ability to speak: the use of her
eyes was almost gone, and so was that of her tears too for the easing of
herself; so much had the excess of her sorrow suspended all the functions of
life in her: She was negligently leaning on the table near to which he sat,
and without giving any sign of sense, save that of breathing, she was in an
estate of moving to pity even cruelty it self. Justiniano seeing her so, was
afraid she would have swooned: He took her by the hand, and besought her to
remember that great courage, which she had always showed against the
persecutions of fortune. It is not fortune that surmounts me, said she sighing,
it is thy insensibility. Ah! Madam, replied he falling down on his knees before
her, and wetting her hand with his tears, wholly transported with love and
grief, will you have me render my self infamous, break my word, and not return
to Constantinople? I am ready to obey you. This courageous Princess did her
uttermost then to take heart again, and beholding him with eyes whence the
first tears began to issue forth; No, my Justiniano, I would not have that,
said she unto him, but only I would have you promise me, that within the time
you are to stay here, you will obtain the resolution from your self to mary me,
and to permit me to follow you; for in conclusion I cannot consent, that we
should be separated from one another but by death alone. This last word was no
sooner pronounced, but the Princess found he self very ill; she became pale
and languishing; her eyes, that were so clear, so piercing, and so full of
fire, grew dead and dull on a sudden; and gently closing themselves up, she
fell backward on her chair, her head leaning on the left side, and weakly
reaching out her right hand to Justiniano, who was so surprised to see her so
changed in an instant, as he could not forbear crying out pretty loud. But
forcing herself to speak, she bid him with a low voice, not to fear the end of
an evil, whereof the beginning was so violent, foreseeing well that fortune
was not yet weary of persecuting her. But Justiniano without answering her,
opens the Cabinet door, calls her women, who frighted to see her in that case
advertise Aemilia of it; and losing their respect in this sorrow, they demand
of her all at once what she ails? What her disease is? and so busy themselves
in succoring her, as they render her no service at all. But she being unwilling
to give them leisure to inquire it to the cause of her sickness, did her
uttermost for to tell them in half opening her eyes, that some days past she
had indeed foreseen that she should be sick, and having neglected those little
symptoms which she had concealed, she perceived very well that she was entering
into a fit of a fever, which was beginning upon her by this weakness that she
felt. Justiniano admiring her wisdom and prudence, did what he could to imitate
her; and concealing a part of his grief, he persuaded her to go and lie down
on her bed; but having not strength enough to sustain her self, they carried
her in the same chair wherein she sat to her chamber, whither her Physicians
where already come, for being incountred by good hap in the Castle they had
been advertised of this accident by one of the Princesses women. They beheld
her, feel her pulse, ask her questions, to come to the knowledge of her
disease, and not able to find out the cause of it, they testify by their
actions, and by their unquietness, that not knowing it perfectly, they are
troubled how to resolve on the choice of the remedies that they would apply
thereunto; At length they ordain her to be laid in her bed, that still they
might gain time to think of that which they had to do. Justiniano out of
respect retired all in despair, and without being able so much as to reason
about his misfortune, his sorrow became so strong, as he felt it but
confusedly. The Princess was not long in her weakness, and Nature doing her
uttermost, gave her spirits the liberty again which grief had arested: But
thereupon, there was so great and sudden a revolution of all her humors, as
she fell into a violent fever, so that the Physicians knowing then the
Princess disease, albeit they were ignorant of the cause of it, they began to
treat her according to the precepts of their Art. Justiniano was also desired
by order from the Princess to repair unto her; he obeyed, and came into her
chamber, with a face wherein the grief of the mind so nearly resembled that of
the body, as he seemed to be sicker than the Princess. He approches, every one
withdrawes, and when the Physicians told her, that after such an accident as
this which had befallen her, it was fit she should not speak much, she assured
them that their conversation should not be long; as indeed all that she said to
Justiniano was, comfort your self for the love of me, if you will have me live
for the love of you, and be mindful not to speak of our misfortunes, no not to
Doria himself if he comes hither. And whereas she saw that Justiniano could not
answer her without discovering his grief, she wrung him gently by the hand, and
calling Aemilia, she commanded her to have a care of Justiniano, until her
sickness was abated. This unfortunate Lover, not daring to speak, for fear of
augmenting the Princesses distemper, and making too much show of his despair,
which she would not have him to do, retired away without saying any more, than,
Ah! Madam, if you will have me comfort my self, you must then recover of this
sickness, which I have been the cause of. After that, the Princess grew
extremely worse and worse; the fever held her ten days with so much violence,
and weakness together, as the Physicians durst not warrant her life: But it was
nothing in comparison of the eleventh day, for then Justiniano, who scarcely
had abandoned her all that time, absolutely believed that she was a dead body.
The fever was very much increased, her strength diminished, the remedies
unprofitable; Nature seemed to want power, and to be so oppressed, as it was
impossible to hope that she should escape. But in the midst of all those
miseries, and in so great an extremity, the constancy of the Princess was
admirable; who, notwithstanding Aemiliaes tears, the cries of her women, and
Justinianoes despair, who was no longer in the terms to suffer himself to be
constrained by reason, expressed such a tranquillity of mind, as it might well
be judged, that life was not very dear unto her: Yet could she not for all that
endure Justinianoes looks, nor see his tears trickle down his cheeks without
resentment, and besides that deplorable object, she was insensible to all
things. But whilst they were in these terms at Monaco, there was nothing but
rejoicing at Genoua, where it was not known that the Princess was so sick as
she was; for from her first time of being ill, she had given in charge that it
should not be published, to the end she might recover without molestation, or
at leastwise dye quietly. It was only then known at Genoua that she was not
well, but that kept them not, from meeting almost every day; according to the
order which the Marquis had established, either at the Counts, or at Doriaes,
who after his return had taken an only sister, that he had, to govern his
house; and who was associated with this fair Troop, which had no other thought
but of delighting themselves. The most considerable of this assembly, were the
Count of Lauagna; Leonora his wife; Horatio of the illustrious house of Cibo,
the brother of Leonora; Soph^onia her sister; Hipolita Doriaes sister; Alphonso
Spinola; Leonardo the widow of Livia, of the race of the Adornes; the French
Marquis; and Doria; whose love began to be somewhat violent for Sophronia, who
certainly was very capable of begetting an ardent passion; she had not only a
piercing and majestic beauty like her sister Leonora, but a noble stateliness,
which rendered her least civilities so obliging, that one of her looks touched
more sensibly, than the tenderest caresses of others: The beauties of her soul
were no less considerable than those of her face; and the graces of her mind
did not give place to all the other excellent qualities that she had; it is not
to be wondered then, if Doria, who was a man of much virtue, and of much
judgment, suffered himself to be touched with such powerful charms. As for
the Count, it might be said that he loved Leonora his wife dearly, but it may
be said also, that he was truly in love with nothing but glory: His galantry,
his civilities, and his liberality, were not terminated with the conques^ of
the good graces of one only Lady, but with the esteem of all the world. Horatio
was of a less active humor, but for all that very pleasing, of a solid
judgment of a gentle and complying spirit, and that notwithstanding some
coldness that appeared in his countenance, had yet been a long time in a
burning passion for the fair Hippolita, whose jealous and distrustful humor
troubled him not a little. Alphonso likewise had much spirit, and Leonida,
whose beauty gave place to none of the rest, added thereunto a gentileness and
liveliness, which rendered her the entertainment of a company. There were many
others besides which had also both wit and beauty, so that the Marquis being
joined to so many excellent persons, it might have been said, that this
Assembly had been perfect indeed, had Justiniano and the Princess of Monaco
been there. The next day after that the Count, Doria, and the Marquis were
returned to Genoua, this illustrious company failed not to meet at the Counts
Palace; and whereas it was forbidden to speak in these occasions, either of
war, or of general affairs; and that Verses, Painting, Music, Love, Virtue,
and all other things that depend of an excellent wit, were those only,
wherewith one might entertain himself in this encounter; the constancy of
Isabella, the merit and love of Justiniano, made an overture to the
conversation. The beauty of the place also added something to the beauty of the
Assembly; for the more magnificence, and making of the better and more glorious
show of their jewels, those days wherein the women decked and set forth
themselves all the windows were shut up, and torches served to light the room,
which this day Leonora caused to be sumptuously furnished, because the company
was to be more than ordinary. The hangings were of Carnation Velvet,
imbroidered all over with tears and spangles of gold and silver; the bed,
chairs, and stools were of the same; and instead of a Persian Carpet, the floor
was covered with a great piece of Gold, Silver, and Carnation Silk tinsell.
This chamber was lighted with thirty Candlesticks, whereof the one half were of
gilt Vermillion set with Stones, and the others of Crystal engraven, and
garnished with gold. Round about this Chamber hung at an equal distance, great
Plates of Goldsmiths work all set with precious stones, and upon a Cabinet of
Nacre and Coral, a great vase of Agate, and two baskets of Gold engraven full
of artificial Flowers. There were also between these Plates great myrrors,
with the Pictures of all the Ladies of the company; and the same placed in such
sort, as opposite to every myrror hung the Picture of a Lady, drawn in the
habit of a Nymph, or a Goddess. The beauty and magnificence of so many
agreeable objects, did without doubt excite some more than ordinary joy in all
the Assembly; and in so charming a place it had been very difficult for one not
to have been wounded with love, which presents not it self but in the midst
of pleasure^ and delights: And indeed Doria was more powerfully touched
therewith than before; Horatio felt new flames for Hippolita; Alphonso began to
look on Leonida without indifferency; and the Marquis seeing never a woman in
the company with whom he had not been already as much in love as was possible
for him to be, was constrained to conserve that still which he bare to Aemilia;
yet was it not for all that so strong in him, as to keep him from complaining
of this adventure; so that after they had spoken enough of Justiniano and
Isabella, and that there was a certain kind of silence amongst the whole
Assembly, which gave way to every one to begin some other discourse; I would
never have believed, said he, that being at Genoua in the midst of twenty of
the fairest persons of all Italy, I should be constrained to send my mind to
Monaco, there to encounter my Mistress. It is not, continued he, because it is
an effect of Aemilia's charms, or of the change of my humor; but it is because
I seeing never a woman here, for whom I have not already been in passion, I am
enforced to conserve that for her still. And certainly if I had thought I
should have tarried so long at Genoua, I should have taken a better order for
my affairs. I would have loved Hypolita a full month, Sophronia as long, and
so all the rest; by which rule I should have needed but twelve Mistresses every
year: But in the manner that I have carried my self I am utterly ruined. For my
part, said Leonida with her joviall humor, I will forget if you will, that
ever you were in love with me, to the end, you may not give any occasion of
sadness to our Assembly: and I assure you that if you could resolve to make a
new declaration of love unto me, I am deceived if you would not love me more
the second time than the first. I have known since, continued she, that I was
to indulgent to you; I commended the first Verses that you made for me; I took
too much care in learning a song which you gave me; I danced better with you
than with all others, and I know not any testimony of esteem and good will
which I did not render you; in the mean time you quitted me cruelly, to love
the severe Sophronia, whose coldness could not keep you from serving her six
days longer than me; and I confess that I should not be sorry to know for what
reason her rigors have charmed you more, than my complyances and favors; to the
end, that if ever we have such another adventure, I may govern my self therein
with address. But I pray you, added she, do not content your self with telling
me, that the same thing arrives almost to all the world, that difficulties and
obstacles augment Love, since custom passes not for a good reason with me, and
that all which I can do, is to follow it only in apparel. It is certain,
beautiful Leonida, answered the Marquis, that this matter is a little too
delicate to be disputed with you; but since you have denounced war against me,
it shall not be to offend you that I do answer you; hear then, if not a
satisfaction to your complaints, at leastwise a resolution to your doubts. I
think, if I understand well that which you marvel at, and that which you
cannot comprehend, it is but to know by what reason rigors and neglect do
augment love, rather than caresses and favors: but if I deceive not my self,
it will not be hard for me to demonstrate it unto you. No man is ignorant but
that beauty ingenders love, and so love is no other thing but a desire to
possess beauty, in such sort, that if love be a desire, it will be so much the
greater, by how much the thing desired shall be difficult in acquiring; since
being once possessed, the cause of the desire utterly ceases: wherefore it is not
an improper action for Love, but forced and necessary, to be more vive and
earnest in rigors than favors, seeing they excite and entertain it. But to
explain my self more clearly, I say, that desire cannot be at rest, because at
the same instant that it arrives at its end, it ceases to be desire: So that if
love be a desire, as I have already said, what stronger proof can one have to
show that it ceases to be love, than to see it arrived at its end? But if (fair
Leonida) you should not agree that love is a desire, I think at leastwise that
you will not deny but that it is a fire, since so many have told you, that they
burned for you, as you cannot be ignorant of this truth. But if you consider
the effects of it, you will see that I am not altogether out of reason; fire is
of a nature so active, as it consumes all that opposes it; if any thing resists
it, if we stop its passage, far from the end which we had propounded, that
which seemed should have served for opposition, serves it for nourishment; for
in conclusion, fire is quick and ardent as long as it finds resistance; but as
soon as it has vanquished, and that it has nothing left to consume, it
consumes it self, and ceases absolutely to be fire, when it has nothing more
to vanquish. If it be then true that love is a fire, it is true that it kindles
by difficulties; that rigors serve to foment it, and when it happens that it
has nothing left to surmount, it loses its being like the fire, and ceases
absolutely to be love. Let us not marvel then any longer, if it decays with
caresses, and augments with rigors. You have ingeniously defended your opinion,
replied Hypolita, and satisfied the beautiful Leonidaes doubts, but not those
which your discourse might have begotten in the mind of the Mistress whom you
serve, if she have any friend here, seeing if it be true that one is to attend
that effect from your love which you speak of, she would not be very judicious
in favoring you, since that would be for her to furnish arms her self for her
own destruction. If I had had any interest in this company, answered the
Marquis, I had not explaned my self in this sort: But I would fain know, said
Sophronia, why that which Leonida calls rigor in me, has not wrought that
effect in you which ought to be expected from it? I mean the augmentation of
your love, seeing according to what you have told us, your desires having never
arrived at their end, and your fire having always found many obstacles, it
should have been still as lively for me, as the first day that you spoke to me
of this flame. All that I have said, replied the Marquis, are general rules,
which convene not perfectly with me, yet is it notwithstanding true, that the
death of desire is in me, as in all men, the death of my love; and if I should
not cease from desiring, I should never cease from loving. But by a particular
grace the term of my love is to love, I desire little, and I am easily
repulsed. If I obtain at first that which I would have which is to be received
favorably, I am arrived at the term that I propounded unto my self; and if I
do not encounter it, I have so delicate a spirit, as being unable ever to hope
for any but facile things, in losing my hope, I lose the love too which I had
for the cruel one; and changing of object, I arrive still at my end, which is
to love eternally. But if this reason which is particular to me, does not
satisfy you, I have no more to say than this, that as we see Amber and the
Adamant, and so many other wonders which are in Nature, working by reasons that
are hidden from the knowledge of men, so am I inconstant in that manner, by a
particular virtue, whereof I cannot reach the cause, and which at this present
does also enforce me to have no more but good will for the fair Leonida. It
were fit then, said Leonora, to the end we may not be troublesome to you now,
that you would talk to us of your past-loves, since you can find none here
that is worthy to be beloved of you twice. We know already, said the Count,
that which befell him in his Country, and that which happened unto him here in
Genoua; but we know not his adventures in the Court of France, and the
proposition which you have made cannot be but very pleasing to the company. For
my part, said the Marquis, I will not resist it, and I will indeed acquaint you
with one. But whereas the anger he was in, for that he could not be amorous in
this place, had taken up his thoughts, he acquitted himself of it after an
extraordinary way; yet was it not without musing attentively on that which he
had to say, never regarding whether all the company were in case to hear him or
no; and after he had performed all the ceremonies of a man that prepares
himself for a long Narration, he began to speak in this sort.

The third History of the Marquis.
I Loved a woman passionately, that was of a condition equal to mine, she
answered my affection, whether feignedly or truly, I know not; but I know that
I received all the honest favors from her which I could expect; and that at
such time as I was the most favorably entreated by her, without having any
occasion to complain on my part, nor seeking any pretext on hers, she forsook
me for another. Behold the end of my History. The whole company then broke out
into such a laughter, to see that his attention, his silence, and the
preparation which he had brought to the hearing of a long adventure, had been
paid with so short a Narration, as they thought they should never have given
over. It must be acknowledged said Leonida at length, that if they which write
our Romanzes, did make them deliver their Relations in this sort, we should not
admire, as we do, the wonderful memories of their Heroes, who make narrations,
which cause them to pass whole days without eating, and nights without
sleeping. For my part, said the Marquis, I found my self so ill with such
another adventure at Monaco, where I recounted my follies of Genoua to the
Princess, as I am fully resolved never to fall into the like again; and I
should rather choose to talk to the beautiful Aemilia, whom I did love, and
still do love whether I will or no, than play the Astrologer a second time. In
the mean while Doria, who was infinitely desirous to speak to Sophronia of his
growing passion, thought there was no better way to make the general
conversation cease, and bring on a more particular one, than to propound the
Music, for the charming of the Marquis his bad humor. To which effect then he
told the Count, that if harmony had at other times had the power to appease the
fury of some, it might easily allay the melancholy of a man that was not
accustomed to have any. The Marquis, who could not be deceived with such like
things, presently perceived Doriaes design; and to vex him a little he told
him, that the remedy which he propounded unto him could not work but upon the
melancholic, and so by consequence, it would be unprofitable for him. But
after he had waggishly caused the conversation to endure a little longer, he
was the first that pressed Leonora to impose silence on the company by a consort
of lutes, which she had made them hope for. The Count then arose, and pushing
open the door of a Cabinet, he ordained the Musicians to begin. In the mean
time the Marquis, who was willing to oblige Doria, said, that the Ladies were
first to be placed, where they might best hear; thereupon he made a demy-circle
of chaires some four or five paces from the Cabinet door, wherein he placed all
the women, and behind every Lady, he seated a man, playing the Master of the
ceremonies so dexterously, as without any show of affectation in his choice, he
placed Horatio behind Hypolita, and Doria close to Sophronia, who failed not to
make use of so favorable an occasion: For after they had harkened a long time
to an excellent consort of Lutes, with a silence worthy of so charming an
harmony, and that he saw how in the assembly each one in particular began
softly to commend that which seemed to be the most agreeable in the Music, he
took the liberty to say unto Sophronia with a low voice; I may not venture to
deliver my opinion of those exquisite lessons I have heard; because the small
attention that I have lent unto them, would not permit me to be an equal judge
thereof. Doubtless the thought which has diverted you from it, replied
Sophronia turning her head about toward him, was either very pleasing, or very
melancholic. It was both together, answered Doria, and if I might presume to
make you the consident of a matter that imports as much as my life, you should
see without question that I am not far from the truth. It is for you to
consider, said she unto him, whether this secret, if it may be told me, would
be advantageous to you for me to know it; and on the contrary, I being of a sex
that is accused of being unable to conceal any thing, whether you are to fear
the exposing of your self to the hazard of my publishing that which you shall
have told me. If that were the only obstacle, replied Doria, that could keep
me from speaking to you, I should not be long without discovering the botom of
my heart unto you, seeing I am but too sure, that you would never tell that
which you had known of me: But there needs so much boldness in daring to
declare unto you, that you are adored, as I dare not undertake it. Doria was no
less surprised for having said so much, than Sophronia, who blushed at first,
and hyding her face with a fan of carnation feathers, which she held in her
hand, she was constrained, to avoid being seen of all the company, to turn
herself yet more toward Doria. But whereas she very much esteemed him, she was
contented to say to him notwithstanding her ordinary severity, You have so
surprised me with the conclusion of you discourse, as I have not the judgment
free enough to discern, whether it be a cast of your wit, or a design to offend
me. Nevertheless, seeing I have an inclination to honor you, I will believe,
without examining the matter, that it is the first I have spoken of. But
whereas it might happen, that if any one should hear this gallantery continue
any longer, one would not have the same indulgence for you, as I have showed
you; and that your words might be interpreted more disadvantagiously, both for
your glory, and mine; do^ me the favor then, either to speak to me no more, or
to change your discou^se. I will obey you, answered Doria, but remember; that
nothing shall ever alter the resolution I have taken to love you eternally.
Sophronia returned no answer to these last words, and turning her self to
Leonida, who sat next her on the right hand, for to demand of her how she
liked the Music, it fell out that in going to avoid one discourse of love, she
interrupted another; For Alphonso, who began already to be in a strong passion
for Leonida, had labored to show it her with the most address that possibly he
could. But whereas she was of a wily humor, and would contrary to that of
Sophronia, cunningly conceal things which were near her heart, by feigning to
discover them; in stead of answering to Sophroniaes question, she said unto her
smiling, and pointing to Alphonso; this Cavalier has talked so much to me of
love, as I had no leisure to mind the Music. Alphonso was somewhat amazed at
this discourse, but seeing that she did not behold him, either with choler, or
contempt, he said unto her with address; there appeared so much of it in your
eyes, as it would be as difficult for one not to be taken with it, as it would
be impossible for you to bemoan the evils which you are the cause of. Whilst
these amiable persons entertained themselves in this sort, Horatio was not so
happy, for whatsoever care he took about it, he could not obtain one favorable
look from Hypolita, whose jealous humor had made her believe that he had beheld
Leonida with too much attention, whether it were that he had observed Alphonso,
who spoke softly unto her, or had without design cast his eyes that way; but in
conclusion all that she answered to whatsoever he could say unto her, was to
pray him with a quipping geer not to be Alphonsoes Rival, who was her brothers
friend, for fear lest the share which she was to have in all his interests,
might oblige her to break with him. At the same instant the consort ceased, and
the Count desired the company to renew their attention for the hearing of a
Dialogue, sung by two most excellent voices; after which the Marquis, who had
set himself down by Leonora, continued the conversation still for some time
with his ordinary address; and then all this fair Troop departed away, but with
different thoughts. Doria felt himself so ea^d, for having made his first
declaration of love to his Mistress, that he was as much satisfied therewith,
as if he had received a great favor from her. But though Sophronia esteemed
very much of Doria, though he was of an illustrious race, though he was beloved
of her brother-law, and that according to apparent reason she could not make a
fitter choice, yet was there a particular one, and that was hidden to all the
world, but not unknown to her, which made her fear the sequel of this passion.
For she was not ignorant that the Count, albeit he esteemed of Doria in
particular, yet bore an irreconcilable hatred to the whole family in general,
though in his actions and words he testified the clean contrary. It was in this
sort that this beautiful and prudent maid reasoned with her self, not doubting
but that Doriaes discourse was unfeigned, because she was sufficiently
persuaded that he would not easily venture to say such like things unto her,
having always mad^ profession of a virtue austere enough. On the other side,
Leonida was not sorry for having touched the heart of Alphonso; and this new
conquest made her return home with joy. As for Alphonso, he could not very well
judge of his happiness or unhappiness, so much did the proceeding of Leonida
seem extraordinary unto him; howbeit he had some hope in the gentleness of her
looks, which promised no rigor unto him. Hypolita had more sullen and unquiet
thoughts, although she had no just cause for them; but it is sufficient to say
that she was jealous for to persuade one that she went not away very well
contented. As for Horatio, he was so afflicted with his Mistresses odd humor,
as he could not resolve to return to his own house, till he had sought for some
comfort from his sister Sophronia, who lived with Leonora, because her mother
was dead: He went then to her chamber to communicate his thoughts unto her.
Ah! sister (said he to her when he came where she was) I am the most
unfortunate of men, and Hypolita the unjustest of your sex. It may be you call
that injustice (said Sophronia unto him) which I should call virtue. No, no,
replied Horatio, and I desire that you would be my judge, if you have nothing
else to do, and can intend to hear my reasons. I am well contented, said
Sophronia, but I am so ill informed of that which has past betwixt you these
six months, wherein I know you have loved Hypolita, as I am in doubt
whether I may judge rightly. It is true, ansvvered Horatio, that I was
vvilling to acknovvledge unto you, that I loved her, and that she hated not me,
without recounting my adventure particularly unto you, because I alvvaies
thought that discourses of this nature did not please you: But albeit you have
the goodness now to let me entertain you with the estate of my affairs, I
will not repeat unto you the first speeches of Love, which I had with
Hypolita, seeing they are for the most part all alike amongst worthy persons.
and whereas time presses me, I will only give you an account of all that
has arrived to me since, but it shall be in fevv words. I served her then
with assiduitie enough, as you might well observe; and even to that point as
she was no longer able to doubt of it. I perceived by her looks, that my
person did not displease her; that my wit and my humor contented hers, and then
when I expected some testimony of affection for a recompense of my pains,
guess, my dear sister, what it was that she gave me, and the only one that I
received? Horatio stayed a while, in expectation of Sophroniaes answer, who
presently said unto him laughing, I think, brother, that I cannot without
trespassing against good manners show my self very spiritual, in guessing at
the favors which may be done to a Lover; wherefore it were fitter that you
should let me know what this favor was, than to trouble me to tell it you.
Harken to me more seriously, I conjure you, replied Horatio, and know that this
testimony of affection, which I have so often received from Hypolita, was not
the giving me occasions to see her, or to speak to her in particular; it was
not an obliging letter; it was not a bracelet of her hair; it was not a
picture; it was not assuring me with her own mouth that she did not hate me;
but it was telling me, that I did not love her, and that I loved another. In
fine, the first proof which I had of her affection, was a mark of her choler;
and to express my self more clearly, jealousy alone has showed her love to
me. You cannot receive a more undoubted proof thereof, said Sophronia
interrupting him: Nor a more grievous one too, replied Horatio. For you must
know (continued he) that after I had done an hundred incivilities to satisfy
her, whereof you have many times demanded the cause of me, though I never told
it you; yet could I not cure her mind of this fancy; And of all the women of
quality of Genoua, I do not know one, that has fair hair, which she has not
believed that I have been in love withal, Leonida only remains, who at this
present sticks in her stomach, and for whom she has ill entreated me to day.
If it be so, said Sophronia, you are to take comfort, and be careful to
justify your self unto her; for when her jealousy shall want an object, she
will questionless be constrained to give you another mark of her affection. Ah,
sister, replied Horatio, you are but little acquainted with this passion! it
forms phantasmes, it deceives the sense, it illudes reason, and without any
ground, or subject, it leaves not to work in those whom it possesses; it makes
them to see that which is not; makes them believe impossible things; and
utterly perverts the understanding. At leastwise, so far as I have observed it
in others, for I have never tried it otherways, which certainly has been
crueller to me, than if I had been jealous my self. Bemoan then, my dear
sister, the misery, wherein I find my self engaged, and whence I know not how
to get out. Verily I do bemoan you, said Sophronia, and so much the more, for
that I do not know how to ease you. I am eased already, answered Horatio, by
recounting my torment unto you; but it is time to let you go to Leonora.
Horatio departed then half comforted in having discovered his grief to the
virtuous Sophronia, but the next day was no sooner arrived, but he was taken
with his unquietness again; which made him go in all have to Doriaes house,
though he could not hope to see Hypolita so early; but he was happier than he
thought he should have been, for it fell out that Doria was in his sisters
lodging, at such time as he was advertised that Horatia asked for him: And
whereas he was not ignorant of the passion he was in for Hypolita, he would
needs have him come into her chamber, howsoever she withstood it, to the end
he might oblige him to a like courtesy, when there should be occasion for it.
Hypolita received Horatio somewhat coldly; but yet with civility, being
unwilling her brother should see their petty disorders. Horatio thought that he
had never seen her so beautiful, as she appeared to him in a neglectfull
habit, which she had put on, with an intention not to have been seen of any
body all that day. Their first discourse was of the last evenings
entertainment, but after that had continued a while, Doria went into his
sisters Cabinet, to write a letter to Sophronia; for he was not yet fully
satisfied with the declaration he had made her; and though he was long about
it, yet could he not draw up one that contented him, so much did he fear to
offend Sophronia. He thought that the incivility which he used in leaving
Horatio upon his going from him, would be in stead of a favor to him; so that
only making him a complement about ^t, he left him the liberty to entertain
his Mistress. He was no sooner alone with her, but he undertook to justify
himself, and gave her so many reasons to make it appear to her that he did not
love Leonida, as all her jealousy could not furnish her with one to oppose
his: After that, he besought her to call to mind the care he had taken to
please her; the extreme affection which he had always born her; and how many
times she had permitted him to interpret her resentments and choler to his
advantage. Hypolita heard him with a great deal of attention, but for all that
he could not persuade her, for with a precipitous voice she sad unto him;
Suppose that your endeavors and services have been powerful enough to obtain
my affection, yet have they not been powerful enough to conserve it; and
thereof I could bring you a thousand testimonies; but whereas they are matters
wherein your excuses might give me satisfaction, and not desiring to receive
any from you, I will not furnish you with means to do it; but to convince
you, I will only say one thing, which admits no reply, and which all your
cunning cannot destroy. Have you not seen me, continued she, receive the
civilities of the youngest of the Fregoses, of the eldest of the Adornes, and
of some others, without regarding yours? Have you not been in some assemblys
where that last has always taken me out to dance, whilst I have scarce so
much as turned my look toward you? Have I omitted any occasion of testifying
unto him, when you past with him before my window, or in all other places where
I might have you for a witness, that his love did not displease me? No,
Horatio, I have omitted none, and the affection which I bore you, made me have
recourse to this artifice, hoping I should know, by giving you some cause of
jealousy, the force of your passion; but I have not seen, though you have seen
all these things, that you had any sense of them; and albeit I knew that by
this untoward experience I should be in danger of losing you, if you were
sensible, yet chose I rather to resolve upon it, and to assure my self of your
love, than to conserve you with a lukewarm and indifferent affection. I have
ever heard, that jealousy is the daughter of love, yet do I not say that love
cannot be without jealousy. Questionless you will tell me, that by my own
reasons I am unjust in complaining of you, since it is possible, that you may
have love without having jealousy. But alas! this discourse has not so much
as an apparent reason, neither can I suffer my self to be persuaded to that
which I desire so passionately. And to show you that I cannot force my mind to
deceive my self, hear a thing, which has made me to think upon this matter. I
have been persuaded then, that love alone cannot produce jealousy; and how it
is necessary that jealousy should have a mother which may contribute to her
birth; this mother, if I be not deceived, is occasion; and as love without her
cannot produce jealousy, so she without love cannot beget jealousy. This
reasoning seems so powerful to me, as you cannot make any objection which it
destroys not; for in fine, you may well have love without jealousy, when as
you have no occasion for it; but I having given it you, and you not having
taken it, is to say absolutely, that you have had no love. Ah! fair Hypolita,
answered Horatio, how I do rejoice at these complaints of yours? for the more
reasons you have brought to maintain your opinion, the more have you
established my felicity. You say then, amiable Hypolita (continued Horatio)
that there can be no love without jealousy, and because I have not been
jealous, I have had no love; you shall pardon me if you please, if without
losing the respect which I ow you, I dare take the liberty to contradict you,
in maintaining with reason, that the perfectest and sincerest reason is that
which admits of no jealousy. It is a thing known of all reasonable and
dis-interessed persons, that he who loves truly, loves only to love, and not to
be beloved, or to expect any recompense; for that thought is too base and
abject for so noble a passion. Now if the love of beauty, which is that whereof
we speak, springs from an object that is pleasing to the sight, it follows,
that so long as this object seems amiable unto us, so long will our love
continue; and whether the person beloved answers our affection, or answers it
not, this love shall be still the same love. But that I may make use of a
comparison as well as you, a man sees a fair Lady, and love arises in his
heart, is it necessary for him to examine whether this Lady be engaged to
another in affection? it is certain that it is not; and it is every day seen
that love does subject us to them, whose love is engaged otherwhere: so that
one may well judge from thence, that a man ought to persevere in his love, though
some cause be given him of jealousy, since when he was not beloved, and that
he was induced to love by the only sight of beauty, he left not to be
infinitely amorous. And if I may be permitted to make use of History in this
encounter, what sympathy, or what affection could that young Athenian expect,
who became so desperately in love with a beautiful Statue, and whose passion
was so extreme, as the like was never heard of? It is very certain, that he
loved only to love, seeing the object of his passion was absolutely incapable
of any correspondence. Now then if it be true, that a Lover is satisfied in
knowing that he loves, he is most assured that jealousy is not of power enough
to destroy his love, and that this jealousy is rather an effect of a
defective, than of a perfect love. And to speak freely unto you, tell me, I
pray you, who can be so hardy, after a worthy person has had the goodness to
receive our services favorably, and to testify some affection unto us, as to
suspect she should have the same thoughts for another? Ah, fair Hypolita, the
gallantry and civility which you have used to the eldest of the Adornes, could
not oblige me to draw so bad a consequence against you. And to comprehend all
the rest of my reasons in one alone, I am but to say, that he who by his
discourse gives some marks of his jealousy to his Mistress, names her
inconstant, facile, and almost infamous: Judge now, fair Hypolita, whether
these be words agreeing with a Lady. In the mean time it is most undoubted,
that in what terms soever jealousy is expressed, it cannot be expressed but
in this manner: whereas quite contrary, this confidence which we have in the
person beloved, which makes us to approve of all her actions, is the true mark
of perfect love, and indeed merits the most acknowledgement, if I may be
permitted to say so. I have not suspected you then, beautiful Hypolita, of
inconstancy, because I have esteemed you very much; and if I had had as good a
place in your heart, as you have had in mine, you would questionless have done
me justice, ^n not accusing me of infidelity. Hypolita was not sorry to find
Horatio's reasons stronger than hers, but whereas she was high-minded, she
would not let him see that she began to repent her; but contrarily making show
as if she thought it strange her brother should leave her so long entertaining
Horatio, she called him, for fear she should be constrained to say something
that would be too obliging unto him. And whereas Doria could not satisfy
himself, he came out of his Sisters Cabinet, and went down to wait on Horatio,
whom she could not let part, without beholding him in such a sort, as he might
easily perceive, that he was in better terms with her than when he came
thither; for it is the custom of those that are easily angry, to be as easily
pacified; to accuse, that one may justify himself; and to complain, that' they
may be satisfied. In the mean time Doria had no sooner left Horatio, but the
Marquis came to him for to show him a Letter, which he had written to Aemilia.
Why, said Doria unto him, do you think of her still? I must needs think of her,
said the Marquis, in the necessity I am in: But before you marvel^t my
constancy, read that which you shall find written in this paper, and halving
opened it, he saw that it was thus.

The Marquis his Letter to Aemilia.
AFter the knowledge you have had of my humor, you will doubtless find it
strange, that the passion which you begot in my heart at Monaco, should be
conserved there still in Genoua, and that an absence of three days has not
destroyed that which you established in a moment. I am for all that constrained
thereunto by a necessity, which I never tried before, and though my mind be not
changed, yet am I forced not to change you. Make use (fair Aemilia) of a good
which fortune presents you with; for not to abuse you, albeit you have the
fairest eyes in the world, and that in the thought I presently am in, you are
the most charming person that I know, my fidelity is for all that rather an
effect of my inconstancy, than of your beauty; for there being never a woman in
Genoua whom I have not loved, I am compelled to love you still, and to fear
that Destiny will force me to become faithful: But at least I can assure you,
that if this misfortune should arrive unto me, there is none in the world that
could render it so supportable unto me as you; and the passion I am in for your
beauty is so strong, that I wish I may not be put to so hard a trial, as not
to be able to be absent from you, for fear I should be constrained to quit
Italic, or at leastwise Genoua, rather than quit my inclinations.


I must confess, said Doria, that I never saw a Love-Letter of the style of
this same; and how pressing soever it be for you to send it away to Monaco, I
am resolved not to let you have it again, till all our friends have seen it.
The Marquis resisted it a while, but at length consented thereunto; and in
regard the Assembly met not very soon, the Marquis sent not away his Letter
till just the day before they thought the Princess would have died: So that
when La Roche was arrived at Monaco, and entered into the Castle, he was much
amazed to see them all in tea^s. And whereas in this occasion the Officers had
no care of any thing, he went even to the Princesses chamber without any
impediment; where he saw Justiniano, he not seeing him, for grief so absolutely
possessed him, as he was incapable of all knowledge, but of that of his own
misfortune. He could not endure the sight of the Princess, neither could he
also keep from her, so that he was in a continual agitation. In the mean time
the Physicians desiring to do their uttermost endeavor, still carefully
observe the estate she is in, they consult with their books, and in so
desperate a disease they resolve to have recourse unto extreme remedies; so
that abandoning ordinary Physic, one amongst them, who was an excellent
Empirick, made her take so wonderful an essence, that after it had caused her
to sleep eight hours, it rectified the blood, diminished her Fever, restored
her strength, and put her quite out of danger. The indifferency she had showed
at the approaches of death, seemed the same, when as the Physicians assured her
that she should not die of this sickness; and she gave them greater thanks for
their affection to her, ^han for their saving her life. Howbeit they were not
without thanks for this re^^rrection; for Justiniano received so great a
satisfaction from it, as he could no^ give them thanks enough of his
acknowledgement. His joy nevertheless was mi^gled with a great deal of
bitterness, and his soul was not in an estate of tasting a ^uiet pleasure. This
while La Roche, whom the Marquis had sent, hearing the the Princess was out of
danger, went to Justiniano's lodging, for to render him ^^e civilities of his
friends, and to assure him that they knew nothing of his aff^^ction. Justiniano
received him with more coldness, than his friendship to them se^med to permit;
but the displeasure wherein he was, dispensed with him from being regular in
his complements; he willed la Roche for all that to render his back unto all
them from whom he had received any, and to pray them not to think it strange if
he returned not to Genoua before the Princess were fully recovered. That don't,
la Roche went to Aemilia to deliver her his Masters Letter, which she received
with a great deal of joy. For the Princesses amendment had put her mind into so
favorable a posture for him, as she told la Roche that she would return an
answer thereunto, albeit the Princess was not yet in case to have her
permission demanded for it, and without further delay she caused Paper to be
brought her by a Maid that served her, and answered the Marquis in these terms.

Aemilia's Letter to the Marquis.
IT would be too much vanity in me to pretend unto the obtaining of that from
you, which so great a number of fair persons could not oblige you to render
unto them. Do not believe then that I regard you as a conquest, which I may
never lose, but contrarily I am resolved to do in this occasion, as great
Captains use to do, who, after they have taken a place which they think they
cannot hold, set it on fire, and destroy it themselves, to get some advantage
still by this loss. And whereas there was never place so hard to be kept, as
your heart, I purpose, in order to that you have written me, to bring new
flames unto it, rather than to resolve to lose you altogether: There will be
shortly at Genoua a fair kinswoman of mine, whom I conjure you to love, when as
you shall no longer judge me worthy of that honor, to the end that in losing
your love, I may at leastwise comfort my self with your sight, with your
conversation, and with your friendship.

Aemilia.


This Letter being sealed, she gave to la Roche, who presently departed for to
return unto Genoua, without speaking to the Princess; for ever since she was
out of danger, the Physicians had absolutely forbidden any one from talking to
her, no not so much as Justiniano, who saw himself very soon kept from it by a
stronger reason. For whether he had been too long without eating or sleeping,
or that grief alone had been the cause of his indisposition, he found himself
within a short time, in a sickness as desperate as that of the Princess, who
not seeing him about her, was very inquisitive to know where he was. The
Physicians and Aemilia, who feared she would afflict her self too much if she
knew the truth, told her, that Justiniano having seen her quite out of danger,
and being pressed by an important affair which had be fallen him at Genoua, was
gone thither with an intent to have returned back again before she should have
taken notice of his departure. But when they saw Justiniano's sickness grow
dangerous, and that the Princess was as much troubled with hearing no news of
him, as she could have been if she had known the condition wherein he was, they
conceived it was sit, fearing the sad event of Justiniano's malady, to acquaint
her with that which they had concealed from her. Aemilia was she that charged
her self with this heavy Commission, she carried the matter so dexterously, as
she engaged the Princess to speak of Justiniano, and to marv^ll at his
unexpected absence, and so unthought-of a silence. It would not be hard for me,
answered Aemilia, with a sad countenance, to take you out of this unquietness,
if I did not fear to give you another greater than that. Whereupon the
Princess, leaning with her right arm on the pillow, and with her left hand also
drawing the curtain, fixed her look on Aemilia, and after she had been a pretty
while without speaking, as it were to divine of that which she should be
acquainted with, she said unto her in such a fashion, as showed that she would
be obeyed; disguise not the truth unto me, let me know my misery as great as
it is, and tell me whether Justiniano be dead or unfaithful; for provided he
be neither the one nor the other, I shall receive all other misfortunes with a
great deal of indifferency. The last cannot be, answered Aemilia, and heaven
will not permit that the other should arrive unto you. But not to disguise the
truth unto you, Justiniano never parted from Monaco, and the fear alone of
redoubling your sickness, in acquainting you with his, has kept us from
telling it to you; but finding it to continue longer than we thought it would,
I held it my duty to advertise you of it. You are a cruel creature, replied
the Princess, to conceal a thing from me, which concerns my life. And what
will Justiniano say of the little care I had of him? It is by his order,
answered Aemilia, that we have carried the business in this sort. If you will
have me pardon you this fault, said the Princess, so order the matter, that
Justiniano may not be surprised when he shall see me. Aemilia did what she
could then to keep her from getting out of her bed, but neither her entreaties,
nor the counsel of the Physicians, could alter her resolution. She calls her
women, gets on a nightgown, and causing her self to be held up by the arms,
she goes to Justininoes lodging, whom she found so changed, as he could hardly
be known. As Soon as he saw her enter he endeavored to salute her, but being
unable to lift up his head, he was constrained to be contented only with
turning his eyes toward her, and saying to her with a feeble and languishing
voice, which could not be heard by any but her self, for her women were a
pretty way distant from them; At length, Madam, fortune shall not separate us,
and death is going to do that, which I expected from the cruelty of the
former: Nevertheless I shall die contentedly, since I have still the pleasure
to see you, provided you will promise to live for the love of me, and that my
memory shall be dear unto you; For I find this advantage in death, that it
keeps me from being unfaithful to you; It finishes the combat of love and
honor which could not be vanquished in my soul; it makes me satisfy them both;
and to say all, it separates us, but I do not forsake you; and I do nothing in
this occasion, but what I cannot choose but do. The Princess having her cheeks
all bedewed with tears, answered him sighing, I am not yet so far from the
grave, but that I may enter into it with you if death should carry you thither;
but if you do love me, you will strive to live. Think not of conserving your
self, since you have no will to it, but of conserving me, and believe not that
you can die without me. I have let you see what grief can do upon me; and I
should have no need, either of poison, or poignard, to quit me of this life,
for the loss of you alone would suffice for it. Think not for all this that I
speak to you thus out of the fear to die, it is an apprehension which is not my
soul, and I do not find death dreadful but in the person beloved; let me not
make trial then of so sharp a grief; live, if it be possible, and contribute
at least what you can unto it. I will indeed obey you, replied Justiniano, but
take heed you do not thereby deprive me of a remedy which I shall not easily
meet with again. As he would have proceeded, one came and advertised the
Princess, that Doria having understood of his Friends sikness, was arived at
the Castle, and desired to see him. The Physicians then approached to
Justinianoes bed side, and told the Princess, that if she loved his life, she
was to let him rest in quiet, and suffer few to see him. Justiniano entreated
them to let him embrace Doria, who presently was brought in. This interview
moved all them to pity that saw it; for Justinian^ appeared so constant, Doria
so afflicted, and the Princess so forlorn, as it was impossible to forbear
shedding of tears at so lamentable a spectacle. The chiefest of the Physicians
coming to Justiniano, and feeling his pulse, found that his fever was
increast, and judged by the unequal beating thereof, that the agitation of his
spirit had redoubled that of his blood and humors; so that approaching once more
to the Princess, he told her that Justiniano was not to be succored with
tears, and that she must absolutely be resolved to leave him to their conduct,
and not to see him again till he was in a better estate. Since my sight is so
deadly to him, replied the Princess, I must obey you, but I believe it will not
be for any long time. This said, she went out of Justinianoes chamber, after
she had charged him again not to resist any remedy, and to remembrr that she
would have him live. Doria and Aemilia helped to lead her to her chamber; but
that which was wonderful in this encounter, was, that the Princess, who had
not been out of her bed since she thought she should have dyed, felt her self
less weak than before, and the desire she had to be able to assist Justiniano
in person, whether the Physicians would or no, was so powerful in her, as in
four days she found her sels in an estate strong enough to be almost
continually with Justiniano, for the space of two months and an half (...)
that the violence of his sickness lasted. During which time, the Count, Doria,
and the Marquis, made many voyages to Monaco, and whereas Justiniano was very
considerable at Genoua, there was not a person of quality which took not great
care to be informed of his health. All the assemblies, which were made at
Leonoraes, were melancholy too; and their conversations, which were wont to be
full of nothing but love and gallantery, were wholly now of the inconstancy of
things; of the necessity of dying, and of the little lastingness of the most
assured pleasures. They could not mervail enough, that after so long an
absence; after the escaping from so many misfortunes; after the drying up of so
many tears; and when it seemed that nothing could oppose Justinianoes and
Isabellaes content, they should find themselves more unhappy than before: they
knew not for all that how far their unhappiness extended, for their secret
misfortunes were without doubt the greatest and most sensible. And when as
Justinianoes sickness was no longer dangerous, and that he had recovered his
strength, then it was that he was the most afflicted. For coming to consider
the little time he had remaining to make good his word which he had given
Soliman; and that he was to quit Isabella, his grief became so great, as had
not his soul been already long accustomed to melancholy, he could not without
dying have supported so grievous an apprehension. But a little while after he
had begun to go out of his chamber, for to repair to that of the Princess,
being still very feeble and languishing, he said unto her with a great deal of
pain; Now, Madam, is the time wherein you are to dispose of me, and to let me
know, whether I am to be wanting, either to my love, or to my honor; live with
infamy, or die with glory; satisfy Soliman, or oblige him by the breaking of
my word to ruin not only all the Christians that are in his Empire, not only
all Europe, but you too, who is more dear to me than all the world beside. I
think, Madam, I have already told your excellency, what I ought to do in such
a grievous case, advise then what you will have me to do: But I beseech you,
make me no more such propositions, as an excess of generositie would render
unjust; hearken to nothing but reason in this encounter; do not follow that
which your affection inspires you with; and remember how I ought not to do any
thing that is unworthy of the honor which I have to be beloved of you. I have
told you already, replied the Princess, what power I have over my self in this
occasion; and my proposition seems so just unto me, as I can find nothing that
can destroy it; For in fine, you will satisfy Soliman, and you will satisfy
me also; I will do nothing against my honor, and I will satisfy that which I
ow to our affection: Resolve then to mary me and to part away, and never hope
that I will change my design. When you were at Constantinople, did you believe
that I had so little affection, as I could easily resolve to receive a visit
from you, for to be deprived afterward of your sight, it may be for as long as
live? Ah! Madam, said Justiniano interrupting her, I had no other intent in
parting from Constantinople, than that of seeing you, and of coming hither time
enough to keep you from shutting your self up in a Cloister. For understanding
the resolution you had taken for it, upon the belief you were in of my death,
nothing could have been able to retain me. What, said I, the incomparable
Isabella shall make her self an eternal prisoner for thee, and if fortune ever
restores thee thy liberty, thou shall find her without hers! Ah! no, no, rather
do any thing to hinder it. It was in this sort, Madam, that I reasoned with my
self; and that, together with the hope of seeing you, made me, without
examining the matter, take my resolution. And I believe I have accomplished
that which I propounded to my self; I have seen you, Madam, and having let you
know that I am living, it is no longer in your power to dispose of your self,
seeing your word keeps you from it; And for me, I promise you if I cannot
break my chains at Constantinople, the news of my death shall soon set you at
liberty: For to expose you to all the misfortunes, which I foresee, in
permitting you to follow my fortune, is a thing that I will nevever consent to.
The Princess, seeing Justiniaenoes firmness, said unto him with a kind of tone,
which testified some choler; if the resolution you have taken be an immovable
one, add not to you cruelty, that of excusing it with weak reasons; and to take
from you the means to do it, I conjure you never to speak to me more of it,
for fear I should not have power enough over my self to keep me from giving you
some marks of my resentment. I assign you eight days, to think yet of this
important affair; but hope not in the mean time, to see me change my mind. I
will obey you, Madam, answered Justiniano, but if you knew to what an hard
trial you do reduce my soul by this excess of generosity; and how difficult it
is to refuse, out of an excess of love, that which love it self does make us
desire, you would have the goodness without doubt not to give me a mark of
affection, which love and reason will not have me receive. The conversation of
these two Lovers finished in tears and sighs; and each of them resting in
their first determination, Justiniano retired to his chamber, but in such
despair, as never man was in more. At length, after he had combated, but in
such despair, as never man was in more. At length, after he had combated
sufficiently within himself, he took his last resolution; and knowing full well
that the Princess would never permit him to part without her; neither would
have him b^eak his word with Soliman; and which too he could not endure to do;
he concluded to go away without bidding her farewell: And to favor his
intention, Doria arrived at Monaco, whom he told in private, for to give some
pretext to his departure, that having seen the Princess given over by all her
Physicians, he had made a vow not to mary her, till he had been at Jerusalem,
if it pleases Heaven to restore her to her health; That whereas he was
resolved to perform this pilgrimage unknown, and that this voyage could not be
but long, he conjured him to take care of the Princess and her affairs in his
absence; That in the mean time he should not speak of this design, till he was
gone; and that then he should deliver his complements to all his Friends. He
told him moreover that he was obliged to steal away from the Princess, who
would not have him make this voyage without her; but being loath she should be
exposed to the incommodities of so painful a pilgrimage, he had concluded to
part without saying any thing to her, but only leaving her a letter. Doria was
strangely surprised with this discourse; but seeing that Justiniano spoke
seriously, he offered (how amorous soever he was of Sophronia) to accompany him
in this voyage; and the contestation which they had upon this subject had not
ended so soon, had not Justiniano told him that the necessity of his affairs
required it to be so; and that to render him a proof of his affection it would
suffice he should furnish him with means to get from Monaco secretly. That
will not be hard for you to do, answered Doria, for yesterday, when I arrived
at the Port, I heard by chance of a French barque, that is bound for Venice,
which parts away to morrow morning by the break of day, and no doubt will
receive you, as soon as you shall present your self; so that you shall have no
more to do, but to get abord her, and I will stay here to deliver your letter
to the Princess. You will be but unwelcome to her for it, replied Justiniano,
who was not willing that Doria should be present at Isabellaes receiving of a
news, which would so much afflict her, for fear lest the constraint she would
be in, should more augment her grief. He prayed him then not to see her, till
he had her permission for it. And whereas he demanded of him, who should wait
on him in this voyage? Justiniano answered him, that one of the conditions of
his vow was, to go alone and unknown. Doria opposed this as much as possibly
he could, but vain was it for him to give any counsel to his Friend; and
Justiniano, taking a part of the money which he had at Monaco, desired Doria to
let him go and write, and to get him to bed. After that Doria had obeyed him,
and that all Justinianoes people were gone out of his chamber, except it were
one, whom he had commanded to tarry in a withdrawing room till he called him,
he leaned on a table, and looking on the paper which he found there, but
without marking that which he looked on, he passed up and down in his mind all
his past misfortunes, all those which then he resented, and all those which he
foresaw for the future; but of all these deadly thoughts, the cruellest, and
the hardest to be endured, was that which set before his eyes, how he was to
abandon Isabella: His heart was not strong enough to support with constancy so
dolorous an apprehension; and his tears falling abundantly on his paper put
him in mind how he was set there with a purpose to write: So that after he had
spent a great part of the night in an estate which may be more easily imagined
than described, he took a pen, and inspired more by his grief than his wit, he
traced these sad words.

Justiniano's Letter to Isabella.
NOt having been able to surmount your generosity, either with my tears, or
with my prayers, I have at length surmounted mine own apprehensions, both with
my love, and with my reason. I have found that though Fortune will not let me
be happy, yet that I shall at least be unhappy alone; and that it is just I
should steal away from you, that I may steal you from the cruelty of Fortune,
by keeping you from following of mine. I am gone then, Madam, or to say better,
I do separate my self from my self, in separating my self from you. I do obey
the desire which you had, that I should satisfy my honor, by showing my self
not unworthy of your love, and by a most sensible misfortune I am forced to
absent my self from you, without having so much as the consolation to bid you
adieu, and to let you see by my tears what the grief is which I suffer. It is
so great, Madam, that losing the use both of sight and reason together, I am
compelled to shut it up in my heart, being impossible to express ie. But before
I leave you, remember that I beg the conservation of your life of you, till
such time as you shall understand how heaven will dispose of mine. I have told
Doria, that I am going to Jerusalem to accomplish a vow, which I made for you
during your sickness; make use of this artifice as you please, and believe that
before it be six months, I shall return happy unto you, or be dead with grief.

JUSTINIANO.


After that Justiniano had made an end of writing, and sealed his Letter, he
called that servant, which he had stayed to wait on him, and willed him to
deliver it the Princess three hours after his departure. And when this man
demanded of him whether he would not go to bed, Justiniano made a sign to him
to be gone, feigning as though he had somewhat else to write; but it was indeed
because his grief was so great, as not being able to sleep, he thought that the
agitation of his body would case that of his mind. He past the rest of the
night in walking up and down, with so great an unquietness, as one is not able
to describe that which he resented. He oftentimes opened the window to see
whether it were day; and though his greatest misfortune was to part from
Monaco, yet one would have said, that he was impatient to be gone from thence;
so much was his soul troubled, and so much was his reason confounded. In the
mean time Doria, who had not slept all the night, hearing Justiniano walk, (for
his chamber joined to his) caused himself to be made ready, and entered into his
friends, just as the day began to break. He would yet have dissuaded him from
this voyage, and once more desired him to let him accompany him, but Justiniano
would by no means accept of so obliging an offer; so that Doria seeing his
friends resolution, was constrained to follow his pleasure. And whereas the
shadows of the night were almost quite dispersed by the approach of the Sun,
Doria went and treated with the Master of the French Barque for Justiniano's
passage, who followed him to the Port, his face covered with his cloak. The
Guards of the Town and Castle, who saw him go forth so early, marvelled not at
it, for during the little time wherein he had been well at Monaco, he had used
to walk out at such hours to entertain his thoughts at the Seaside. The
separation of these two friends had been with more tenderness, if Justiniano
had been less afflicted; but love so strongly possessed his heart, as there was
no more room left there for friendship: so that when he came to embrace Doria,
all that he could say to him, was to conjure him to have a care of the
Princess. He would fain have disclosed the truth unto him, but Isabella having
forbidden him so to do, he durst not disobey her. He got aboard then being
scarce able to speak, and suffering himself to be disposed of by them that
received him, he abandoned himself not so much to the Sea, as to his grief. The
Pilot having order given him to part, steered his course for Venice, and
Justiniano standing up beheld Monaco, with his arms across, and his eyes full of
tears, never marking Doria, who still made signs of farewell to him from the
Port, whereunto he returned no show of answer at all. But when Doria had lost
the sight of him, he went back unto the Castle, with a purpose not to show
himself to the Princess till she commanded him, that he might exactly observe
what Justiniano had entreated him unto. In the mean time the three hours after
his departure being past, he with whom he had left his Letter, went and
delivered it to the Princess, who was but newly awake. At first when she heard
that Justiniano had sent her that paper, she changed color, and asked where he
was: He went forth very early with Doria, (answered this man) whom I saw return
back alone to his chamber. Without doubt (said the Princess then to her self
opening the Letter) Justiniano has deceived me, and Doria to be faithful to
his friend, has betrayed me. But when she had read that which Justiniano wrote
her, and that she knew he was gone, as also that Doria was deceived as well as
she, though in a different manner, she gave a great skreek: howbeit desiring to
conceal her grief from him that brought her these deadly news, she commanded
him to withdraw, and to stay in her house till he had further order. As soon
as she was at liberty to complain, what said she not against Justiniano,
against fortune, and against her self? Am not I culpable of mine own
misfortune? (said she ^ighing) Ought not I to have had him watched? Had I not
made sufficient trial of the stedfastness of his resolution? he had resisted
my entreaties, he was not moved with my tears, he would not hearken to my
sighs: With what stronger arms could I hope to vanquish him? but now is no time
to reason of things done; Justiniano is gone, and how strong soever my love is,
I may not forget mine honor; I cannot resolve to follow him as a forsaken one;
he separated himself from me that he might be generous; and that I may not
swerve from virtue, I will not follow him. But what say I, unfortunate as I am?
if I know not where he is, how can I follow him? Then suddenly holding her
peace, and turning her self on the other side, she sighed with so much
violence, as it was impossible for her to speak. A little after for all that
she fell to speaking again in this sort. Ah, Justiniano, (said she) what a
sensible outrage to my affection was this excess of love, that has torn thee
from me! the tempest whereunto thou exposest thy self, is to be less feared, no
doubt, than that which is raised in my soul. Is it possible (continued she)
that thou could resolve to refuse the having of me for a companion of thy
miseries? Certainly thou did not believe that my soul was strong enough; and
thou thoughtest peradventure that I did not entreat thee, but to be denied. But
I ams cruel (said she) to make so ill a construction of the meaning of the
most generous of men; who deprives not himself of me, but for the love of me;
who consider none but my interests, and who loves not even his own honor, but
for my proper glory. Let us think better of Justiniano; let us live to obey
him; and let us not give fortune that advantage, to have more cruelty, than we
have constancy: Let us force her by our resolution to be weary of hurting us,
since indeed there is nothing left us but that to do. After she h^d been a
pretty while without speaking, and that she had hidden his Letter, she sent for
Doria to confirm that unto him which had been told him by his friend. And
whereas she had a great and generous soul, she composed her countenance so
well, and so thoroughly restrained her tea^s, as no more sorrow appeared in her
face, than that which the absence of Justiniano alone might well be the cause
of. Is not your friend cruel indeed (said she to Doria as soon as he came to
her) to steal away from me, for the satisfying of a thing which he owed not but
to my consideration, seeing it seems to me that there is some justice I should
follow him in a voyage, whereof I was the occasion. And if I may be permitted
to accuse you of too much fidelity toward him, I shall tell you freely, that
you would not have a little obliged me, if you had betrayed his secret in
discovering i^ to me. There is sometimes (added she) a great deal of generosity
in not serving ones Friends according to their intention, and in considering
rather that which is utile and glorious, than what is pleasing to them; and if
I be not deceived, the matter ought to have gone so in this encounter. But in
conclusion Justiniano is gone, and there is nothing left us but to make vows
for him, as he has made them for us. It is certain, replied Doria, that
Justiniano's voyage stangely surprised me; and that I was tempted to acquaint
you with his design: but I confess, Madam, when I knew that his voyage was
absolutely necessary, seeing he had promised it, and that he did not steal away
from you but to keep you from following him, I found that he had reason for it,
and I served him in his design; Yet was it not till I had first offered to
accompany him, with all the testimonies of affection I could render him; and I
had added force to entreaty, had he not assured me that he should not
accomplish his vow, if he went not alone and unknown. But is it possible that
he is gone, said the Princess? disguise not the truth unto me, is he not
concealed in some place, to take order for his affairs? No, Madam, answered
Doria, for he has given me the charge of them. If that be so, said the
Princess, who would fain have been at liberty to shed tears, I hold it fit
that you should go and publish at Genoua the true cause of his absense, for
fear lest so unexpected a departure should cause bruites to run about, either
to his disadvantage, or mine. But before you go, tell me I pray you, whether
Justiniano were afflicted indeed to quit me? whether he said any thing to you
to tell me? and what were his last words? They were all for you, replied Doria;
for after he had embraced me, all that he could obtain of his grief was no
other than force enough to enjoin me to take care of you; so that Madam, you
may dispose of me as you please, and believe that never any eloignment begot so
great an affliction, as that which I saw in Justiniano: And knew I not that he
loves you more ardently, than ever person did love, I should hardly believe
that absence alone could cause so great a displeasure in his soul. The Princess
felt her self then so pressed with grief, as it was impossible for her to
retain her tears, and seeing that she could not hide them from Doria, she said
unto him wiping her eyes; You may not think it strange, that I am not more
constant than Justiniano, since I am as unhappy as he; and that I yield not to
him in affection. This weakness justifies his, said Doria, and I profess he
were unworthy of the honor which you do him, if he did not resent, as he does,
an absence that separates him from the only person which can make him happy.
The princess and Doria had some more such like discourses, but at last she
prayed him once again to return with all speed to Genoua; and for that effect
she commanded a Vessel should be made ready to part away presently after
dinner. The thing was executed accordingly, Doria departed from her, and by her
direction carried back with him a part of Justiniano's train, the Princess
retaining the other in her service till the return of their Master. The next
day Doria arrived at Genoua, where he delivered the departure of Justiniano to
all his acquaintance. Every one received this news with mervail, but amongst
others, the Count, Alphonso, the Marquis, and all the rest of his Friends, were
not contented with merveling, they were extremely afflicted at it. And being
all met together at Leonora's, they talked a long time of this adventure; now
though they doubted not but that it was in the manner as Doria recounted it,
yet was not their reason for all that satisfied. They found something that was
strange in this voyage; and condemned Doria for suffering him to go. Leonora
and Sophronia were not of that opinion, and maintained that he had done well,
in not hindering him from accomplishing that which he had promised. For my part,
said the Marquis, I do not condemn Doria, for it may be if I had been in his
place, I should have done the same thing; but if I had been in Justinianoes,
when as the Princess was sick, I am very sure that I should not have sought for
remedies so far of; and I would have chosen a pilgrimage, where she might have
easily followed me, to the end I might not have been separated from her, after
so long an absence. But whilst his friends lamented him, indifferent persons
talked of it according to their humors; and as truth alters in going far from
them which speak it, so there were those that affirmed, how Isabella had made a
vow during her sickness never to marry, and that Justiniano out of despair had
been so precipitate. Others would have this vow, which Justiniano was gone to
accomplish, to be made during his captivity. Some again said, that the ghost of
the Princess Mother had appeared unto her, and had forbidden her to mary him,
so that being enraged at such a resolution he was gone to the wars. To
conclude, they said all things except the truth, which was not known to any but
the Princess and Justiniano, who without regarding what was said of him, had
his imagination filled with nothing, but his misfortunes, and the incomparable
Isabella.

IBRAHIM: OR THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The second part. The fifth BOOK.
THat we may not aggravate the grief of Justiniano, since it is not the last
that he is to endure, let us land him at Venice, without describing his
unquietness, his sorrows, and his transports. As soon as he was arrived there,
he had no other design but of thinking of his departure from thence: And
whereas there was a great commerce from Venice to all the Islands of the
Archi-pelago, and to Constantinople it self, it was not long before he met with
a ship that was ready to set sail for the Isle of Chio, so that it was not hard
for him to get passage in her upon pretext of some important affairs, which he
said he had with certain Jewish Merchants of Pera. He imbarqued himself then
without being known, and too prosperous in his Navigation, by reason of his
eloignment from Isabella, he arrived at this Island; where he was not long
before he found a Vessel that was bound for Pera, and shipping himself in her,
he left the I Will of Mitilene on the right hand, and on the left that of Lemnos,
now called Staliment. From thence he entered into the Straight of Gallipoli,
where stand the two Castles of Sest^s and Abydus, which the Turks name the
Dardanilli, and so came to the Prepontis, called Marmora, where he entered into
the Basphorus of Thrace, and arrived at Pera, where he would not go on land
till it was night, because of the habit which he wore. As soon then as he came
thither, he went to the Christian Religious men that lived there, who were
infinitely glad to see him again, for he was a mighty support unto them, After
their first complements, they told him that his absence had occasioned some
mischiefs in the Ottoman Family; but though he pressed them much to express
themselves more clearly, they would not do it, knowing full well the extreme
affection which Justiniano had always born to Mustapha, and the generous
Gianger. And then again Justiniano had his mind so filled with his own
misfortunes, as he insisted not much upon those of others. From thence he sent
secretly to an Italian Slave, whom he had left at home, to bring him a Turkish
Habit: Which was done accordingly, and the next day in the eve^ing he entered
into Constantinople, but so altered from that which he was wont to be, as he
was hardly to be known. As soon as he was at his Palace, and that he had
received the complements of all his Officers, of whom he was exceedingly
beloved, he went to the Seraglio, although it was not the custom to enter there
at such like hours: but Justiniano, whom henceforward we call Ibrahim,
remembered his old privileges still. The Capigis, which kept the gate, repulsed
him somewhat rudely, but as soon as they heard his voice, they craved pardon of
him, and a Capigibassi went and advertised the grand Signior of Ibrahims
arrival. He was at that time in so profound a melancholy, as less than a name
that was so dear unto him, could not have made him answer him that spoke to
him; But the name of the Bassa was not so soon come to his ear, as approaching
to this blessed Messenger, which brought him so pleasing a news, he demanded
of him, if it were true that he was returned, why he did not come in as he was
wont to do, without advertising him of it? This demand was a commandment to
the Capigibassi, who presently caused Ibrahim to enter. As Soon as he appeared,
Soliman charged every one to withdraw, so that seeing himself at liberty, he
embraced him with so much tenderness, that though his mind was wholly taken up
with love and his miseries, yet found he himself sensible of so great an amity.
Is it possible, said Soliman unto him, that I should receive this consolation
in my misfortune? but am I not to blame, continued he, to doubt that thou
could not be generous enough to come back again? This doubt would
questionless be an injury, replied Ibrahim, had it not proceeded from the
impatience of my return, rather than from a distrust of the promise I had made
to thy Highness. It is not without reason, said Soliman interrupting him, that
thou think I have desired it, for as soon as thou had abandoned me,
victory, fortune, and virtue abandoned me to. I became at once, both the most
unfortunate, and the most faulty of all men; and by the malice of another I
lost all that thy friendship had acquired me. I am no more the Soliman, whom
thou thoughtest worthy of thy esteem, and to let thee know the deplorable
estate wherein thou find me, I have no more to say to thee, but that thou
shall never understand from my mouth the mishaps that have befallen me, or to
say better, the crimes which I have committed. However I will impart unto thee,
that all that which my arms had conquered in Persia, by thy valor and conduct,
is revolted; that Assyria and Mesopotamia are no longer under my power; that
Ulama having been wounded, his Troops have been defeated; that my whole army
has been routed; that Tauris is lost; and that there is no more left me of all
thy conquests, than the bare remembrance of thy victories. But, ah, how happy
should I be, if I had also lost the moity of mine Empire, and had not made my
self unworthy of reigning over the other! Soliman stayed here to fetch a great
sigh; and when as Ibrahim would have answered him, he would not suffer it, but
conjured him not to speak at all to him, save only to promise that he would
never hate him, whatsoever he understood of his violences. Ibrahim was so
surprised to hear Soliman speak in this sort, as he scarce knew what to answer
him. For whereas he had not reflected much on that which the Religious men of
Pera had told him, imagining it had been some dissension^, which the artifices
of Roxelana had sown in the Ottoman family, and none of his Officers having
dared to acquaint him with that which had past, he could not conceive how
Soliman should be so faulty. He answered him then, that he would give his own
eyes the lie, even when they should report unto him that he had committed a
crime; that he was too well assured of his justice and virtue to doubt of it;
that great Princes might sometimes appear culpable to the eyes of their
subjects, and yet be innocent in their own souls; and that in fine, he gave
him the same word, which he had so exactly observed, that he would always have
the same thoughts for him, as he had formerly had. He besought him withal not
to conceal his misfortunes from him; but Soliman half comforted with the
promise he made him, desired him not to press him to it, and further obliged
him by oath, not to speak of his crimes when he should come to know them; and
should only believe that Roxelana was the cause of all his disasters. Ibrahim,
seeing how sensibly Soliman was touched, and perceiving well by his tears that
this should be some lamentable adventure, durst not speak to him more of it;
and though he had resolved to cast himself at his feet, when first he came
before him, to demand his liberty of him, hoping he had then been in some sort
accustomed to his absense; yet held he not that a seasonable time, and that he
was to wait for another occasion. This thought redoubled his grief yet more, so
as that joined to the melancholy which his displeasures and miseries had
painted in his face, made Soliman observe athwart his tears, that he was
extremely changed. I will not ask of thee, said he unto him, whether thy voyage
has been prosperous or no; for I see so many marks of sadness, both in thy
color and countenance, that feeling not my soul strong enough to support mine
own misfortunes, I do not desire to know thine, which would be no less sensible
to me, than if they were arrived to my self; for in fine, I love thee still the
more. Ibrahim returned no other answer to this discourse, but a low obeisance,
and a deep sigh, they continued yet a while in so sad a conversation; but at
length Soliman seeing it was late, and believing that Ibrahim stood in need of
rest, he dismissed him, after he had told him with a calmer countenance, that
as in going from him he had carried away all his good fortune and virtue, so he
hoped that his return would bring him back so precious a treasure again; and
that from thenceforward his innocence should not be capable of being corrupted
by another crimes. Ibrahim being returned to his Palace, found a slave of
Ulama's there, who understanding by the bruit which was spread abroad amongst
all the Grandes of the Port that he was come, presented himself unto him, and
delivered him a letter from his Master, who had sent him to Constantinople,
with order to attend Ibrahims return there, and to beseech him to save his live
in saving Felixana's. For this slave, who had followed the fortune of his
Master when as he changed party, had always had a great share in his
confidence, principally in that which concerned Felixana. This name of Felixana
surprised Ibrahim, for he well remembered that this was the maid which had
suffered shipwreck with the Princess of Persia, at such time as Rustan had
forcibly carried her away; so that believing her dead, he could not comprehend
which way she should be saved. He entered then into his chamber, and causing
this slave to follow him, he opened Ulama's letter, and saw that it was thus;
for during the war of Persia, he had learned that language perfectly enough,
both to understand, and speak it.

Vlama's Letter to Ibrahim.
WHen as the injustice and tyranny of Tachmas had forced me to seek out a
sanctuary, to shelter my head in from a storm, which love and jealousy had
raised up in his soul, after I had cast mine eye on all the Princes of the
Levant, I fixed it on the Emperor whom we serve. But if I may be permitted to
open my heart unto you, the reputation of Ibrahim alone made me desire to be
Solimans, and if you remember it, it was unto you that I addressed my self; it
was by you that I received his word; it was you that presented me unto him; and
it is from you also that I a second time expect the life which you saved in
that occasion. But whereas the history of my misfortunes is too long to be
written unto you, know in few wordo, that in protecting the Princess Axiamira,
whom Soliman retains in prison, you may both perform an action worthy of your
self, and render me the most obliged of all men. Her high birth, her extreme
virtue, and her misfortune, are reasons strong enough to carry you to serve
her. But after you have satisfied this supplication, you are further to know,
that in the person of Felixana, who partakes in the miseries of Axiamira, you
may render me either happy, or unhappy, and absolutely dispose of my life. So
do then that my sanctuary may not be unlucky to me, and that the same place
which I have chosen for my security, may not be the place of my punishment. If
you will take the pains to see Felixana, she will let you understand what our
misfortunes have been, and I doubt not, knowing your generosity, but her tears
will touch you more than my words, and that her virtue will induce yours to
succor us.

Ulama.


The reading of this Letter touched Ibrahim very effectually; and absolutely
carried him to serve Ulama, whom he had always loved exceedingly; and then his
own particular mishaps taught him but too well how to ease those of others. He
willed the Slave, who had delivered him this letter, to be with him the next
mo^ning, that he might be a witness of the care which he would have to satisfy
Ulam^. After that he retired into his Cabinet, whither having sent for the
chiefest of his Officers, he enquired of the general report of affairs; but
whereas they believed that the grand Signior had told him all, and that he
himself was not ignorant of that which every one knew, he spoke very confusedly
to him of these things. Howbeit Ibrahim picked that out of his discourse which
was so lamentable in those adventures, and which the grand Signior would not
tell him. And truly it was almost an advantage to him, to be so afflicted with
his own misfortunes, that he was thereby made the less sensible of those of
others, when they were past remedy. For whereas he had always protected the
persons whom this misfortune concerned, he had resented it more if it had
fallen out at another time. But it is the custom of the miserable to have one
prime apprehension, which in some sort comforts them, to see that they are not
the alone unhappy in the World: Nevertheless Ibrahim received this news with
tears; and this man continuing to recount unto him all that he knew, told him
that there was a Princess prisoner in the Castle of the seven Towers (which is
a place wherein none are ever put but persons of quality) who was by report
very much afflicted. Ibrahim doubted not but that it was Axiamira, though he
had believed her to be dead; and having named her unto him, he confirmed him in
that opinion. The grand Vizier, seeing he could learn no more, got him to bed
with so much affliction, as he could not sleep all that night. As soon as it
was day his Palace was full of visitants; the Beglerbei of Romania, that of
Amasia, the Bostangibassi, and all such as were of any rank in this Empire,
presented themselves at Ibrahims rising. After the first complements, some of
them spoke indeed of the disorders of Persia, but none durst say any thing to
him of that which concerned the Imperial Hown, or that which directly regarded
Soliman, as well for the respect which they bare him, as for the fear they
were in, lest being unable to discourse of it without tears, the Emperor should
know of it, and take it ill that they should entertain Ibrahim with a matter,
whereof he desired the memory might be extinguished: Neither durst Ibrahim
speak to them of it, having perceived well enough, by the confused relations
which had been made him, that Soliman was not absolutely innocent of the
misfortunes which had happened unto him. This conversation then was spent with
constraint enough; and the hour of the grand Signiors rising being come, the
grand Visior went to the Seraglio, accompanied with that multitude which
usually strive all they can to render themselves agreeable to him, who was so
to their Sovereign. The grand Vizier made have to the Seraglio, to the end he
might have the more time to go the same day to the Castle of the seven Towers,
for to see the Princess Axiamira, who knevv not that she should see her
Protector so soon: For at the very same instant, when as Ibrahim was thinking
of her liberty, she was entertaining her self with Halima, the Governors Wife
of that Castle, whose inclinations were virtuous enough. She was well stricken
in years, so that being sufficiently informed of all that had past at the Port
for a long time before, she could easily satisfy the questions which the
Princess asked of her; who daily resenting the effects of Roxelanaes
wickedness, could not forbear complaining of her. The very same day, Halima
going pretty early to bid Axiamira good morrow (for she loved her very much)
she found her somewhat sadder than ordinary. Shall I never see you, said she
unto her, in a quieter mind? and shall not time work that in your soul, which
it does in all the World beside? Ah! Mother (for so she called her) answered
Axiamira, time vouchsafes not to work that effect in me, which all the
afflicted find by it; for could the misfortunes which have lighted upon me be
defaced out of my memory (which will never be) others do daily arrive unto me,
and every moment of my life furnishes me with a fresh subject of sorrovv; for
indeed there is no justice in it, that I should survive so many generous
persons, and even mine own hopes. Is there any new mishap befallen you,
replied Halima; for the extraordinary langor which I perceive in your
countenance, makes me, Madam, thus to demand the cause of it? It is this,
answered Axiamira, that as if I had not effectual miseries enough to prosecute
me, my very dreams do join with them in it; for during this last night I saw a
dreadful woman, whom I took for Roxelana, that exposed me to the fury of four
Tigers, which pursued me all the night long; at leastwise, me thought so. Now
though I am not so scrupulous as to stand upon such like things, yet I confess
to you, that this unpleasing illusion has so lively imprinted Roxelanaes true
cruelties in my mind, as I cannot be persuaded but that the phantasm, which I
savv in my dream, resembles her. Doubtless it has much deceived you, said
Halima; for if her soul were as beautiful as her body, she would be one of the
perfectest women on the earth. You have so often promised, replied Axiamira, to
recount unto me by what artifices she could come to share the Empire with
Soliman, and seduce so great a Prince as he is, that in the anguish wherein I
am at this present, if you do not keep your word with me, nothing can charm my
grief: For whereas I doubt not but you will acquaint me with some of her
wickednesses, which as yet I have not heard of, it would be some comfort to me
to understand them, that I may hate her so much the more, and that I may learn
what land has produced so strange a Monster. I will gladly satisfy you,
answered Halima, and as I have told you heretofore, I know this History very
well. For besides the principal things, which no man is ignorant of, I am
privy to some particularities, that are not known to all the World, and that by
the information of a Slave, who was Roxelanaes favorite during that time, but
was afterward turned out of the Seraglio by her herself, in a fantastical
humor, which makes her that she never loves any one thing long, and has ever
since lived with me. You shall hear then that which you desire to know, and
which I have learned from this Slave, and some others who were well acquainted
therewith: But in regard you have time enough to spare, I will intermix the
History of her Father, which will not be unusefull for the intelligence of
hers. Axiamira consenting to it caused Felixana to sit down by her, and Halima
began to speak in these terms.

The History of Bajazet and Roxelana.
THey which know the birth, breeding, and first inclinations of Roxelana,
cannot marvail at the last things which she has done; but contrarily they
would have reason to find it strange, if she had not undertaken any thing to
satisfy her ambition, which is the only passion that reigns in her soul, and
for which she sets all the rest on work; never making use of love, hatred,
envy, and jealousy, but to satisfy that. Now to show you that she has drawn
this inclination from her Father, who brought her up, and confirmed her in the
opinion, that greatness was the sovereign good of this life; and that to attain
unto it, virtue and honor were to be despised. You are to know, that in times
past Roxelanaes Father was in reasonable good favor with the Emperor Selim,
Father to Soliman; and that after the death of Selim, Soliman also had a great
care of his fortune: And certainly he had rendered him one of the most
considerable of this Empire, had he had as much fidelity for his Master, as he
had address for to please him, cunning to conserve himself, and dissimulation
to conceal his vices from a Prince who never had any, and who was never
carried to any violence, but by that of love. But withal it must be
acknowledged, that this passion has often perverted all his inclinations; or
at leastwise has forced him to do things quite contrary to the sense of his
soul, when as it is peaceable. But to come again to Bajazet (so was the Father
of Roxelana called) after he had by an hundred artifices, which would be too
long to recite, arrived at that height about Soliman, which I have told you;
and that there was not any charge whereunto he might not have raised his hopes:
It happened for his ill fortune, that Soliman sent him to carry his directions to
Scutary, where the Beglierbei of Natolia, who was there at that time,
committed to his conduct the fairest Slave that ever was seen, for to present
her in his name to the Sultan, to the end that if he adjudged her worthy to be
of the number of those that are destined to be his women, he should receive her
into his Seraglio. Bajazet accepted of this employment with joy, without any
other design at that time, than to do a thing which he thought would not be
disagreeable to Soliman, who was then in the prime flower of his age, and one
of the goodliest Princes of the world. But when the day of his departure was
come, and that the Beglierbei of Natolia had put the Slave into his hands, who,
according to the custom of those which are to be presented to the grand
Signior, was most gorgeously set forth, he was so mightily taken with the
sparkling of her eyes, as if the Beglierbei, who was named Amurath, had noted
his carriage, he might well have known that he was too sensible of the attracts
of beauty, to be made the conductor of a slave, that was able to subject the
whole world; for as I have heard say, she was as fair as Roxelana, whom I have
sometimes seen on the terrace of the Seraglio, which looks on the Sea, where
ordinarily she is, when public rejoycings are celebrated. But certes it must
be acknowledged, that Soliman is excusable for loving her, maugre her
artifices, for indeed she is the greatest beauty that imagination it self is
able to conceive. This Slave, of whom I speak, being then as fair as I describe
her to you, and being remitted unto the conduct of Bajazet for so long a
journey, he became so desperately in love with her, as notwithstanding the
respect which he owed to Soliman, and without fear of the chastisements of an
offended Prince, he resolved to possess her, and not to render her unto him;
howbeit he resisted so dangerous a temptation for some time; but his wit, that
was but too fertile in inventions, having furnished himself with one, which he
believed was good enough to make his design succeed without danger, he thought
of nothing else but of executing it; and behold the way which he took to bring
himself to it. This Slave destined to the grand Signior, had been sold to
Amurath, the Beglierbei of Natolia, a little before Bajazet's arrival, by
certain Pirates, who not so much as knew of whence she was, though by her
pronunciation it was gathered that she was of Persia: but whereas her language
was not understood of any one, and that it appeared also how she understood
nothing that was said to her, he judged that she knew not they were carrying
her to the grand Signior. So that using her with a great deal of kindness
during all the voyage, and testyfying much affection unto her, she seemed to be
comforted in her misery, at leastwise she showed a more quiet countenance. He
took exceeding care then, that she might not understand by signs, that which
she could not understand otherways; and whereas he had been sent upon a secret
expedition, he was but little accompanied, which served very much too for the
furthering of his design. When as they approached to Constantinople, he took
his measures so right, that arriving too late, he seemed to be constrained to
lie at an house that he had some four or five miles from the City, where out of
jealousy he had caused a young woman to be kept, whom he had exceedingly
loved; but indeed his intent was, not to enter into Constantinople, for a
secret reason which I am going to acquaint you with. He arrived then at this
Countrey-house, wherein none lived but that woman, an old Eunuch that looked to
her, and two slaves that waited on her, all his retinue being at his house in
Constantinople, where according to the permission of our Religion he had also
two wives, with whom the imperious Alicola (so was she named that abode thus in
the Country) could never agree. She was beautiful, and of a great spirit, but
had such a disdainful look, and so ambitious an inclination, that there was
need of Bajazets humor for one to have had any love for her. This conformity
which was between them did not for all that produce a reciprocal affection;
for howsoever he had endeavored to make himself be beloved of her for the
space of a year and more that she had been in his hands, yet could he never do
it: whether it were that she had a natural aversion for him, or that having
found two other wives already in his house, which had all the authority over
it, she could not endure to be the last; so it was, that she could not love
him. She was a Persian by Nation, and by what adventure she came into Bajazet's
hands I am not able to say; but it suffices to let you understand, for the
intelligence of the History which I am recounting, that she was a Persian, and
that as often as he spoke to her of his affection, she used to tell him, that
when he was grand Vizier she would promise him her good will: And her pride was
so insupportable, as he had been constrained to separate her from his other
wives, being also jealous of her, as I have already declared. Knowing then her
ambitious humor, and the love of the fair Slave having almost extinguished
that, which Alicolaes rigor had much diminished before; after he had conducted
this stranger into a chamber, and given the old Eunuch order to have a care of
her, he entered into that of Alicola, who received him after the accustomed
manner, that is to say, with a great deal of coldness. And whereas he thought
that he should surprise her with that which he purposed to say unto her, he
mused a little before he spoke; but she without losing of time demanded of him,
how long she should continue a prisoner? whether he was resolved that she
should always live separated from the commerce of the world? and that she
should have no other entertainment but the view of a garden, and the noise of a
fountain, whilst his other women, which were not worthy to be his Slaves,
enjoyed all the pleasures of Constantinople? Bajezet finding this occasion so
favorable, would not lose it; so that as soon as she ^ad done speaking, he
answered her in this sort. Heaven is my witness, fair Alicola, said he unto
her, that the discourse which I am going to make you, is rather an effect of
despair, whereunto your rigor has reduced me, than of any new passion; seeing
it is certain, that if by a coldness, which had never example, you had not
extinguished the fire that your eyes had kindled in my soul, I had never been
sensible of love but for you only; and I should never have been capable of
seeking to cure my self with an infidelity to Soliman, nor of changing of
affection, by forgetting of yours. Alicola believing that Bajazets discourse
was but an artifice, to try if he could take her with jeal^usie, quickly
interrupted him. Have I not told you above an hundred times (replied she) that
love can never touch me without ambition? If you were a King, I should be
jealous of your glory, and of your Crown; but of your person, in the estate
wherein it is, I should never he: Think not then that I do give you marks of
my love, in giving you any of my jealousy; love as long as you please, and
whom you please, I will not appose it; for in fine, my heart cannot be touched
but with magnificence and splendour, and not with tears and sighs. If you will
give me leave to speak to you, answered Bajazet, I will let you know, that I
have a mean to satisfy both your ambition, and mine; and it is so facile, that
it depends on your will alone to be a Sultana, and to render me one of the
chiefest of this Empire, and one of the happiest men of the world, by putting
me in possession of a person that is infinitely dear to me. This discourse is
so intricate (answered Alicola) that if you do not explain your self better, I
shall not be able to tell you what my will is; but in conclusion I assure you,
that if so unlikely a thing should depend on it, I would soon get out of your
hands, and would choose rather to satisfy your ambition, than your love; for if
I were in a condition to make your fortune, mine without doubt would be at the
point I would have it, and it may be as I deserve, that is to say extremely
great. Bajazet, who would not displease her, protested once again, that if he
had believed he could have moved her with time, he would never have been
carried to that which he was propounding unto her: whereupon he related unto
her, how Amurath had trusted him with a Persian Slave, which he destined to the
grand Signior; how the remembrance of her rigor had made him sensible of the
attracts of her beauty; and at last said unto her, whereas you are no less
beautiful than she; are also as young; are known of few; have the same
colored hair; and of a like stature; I will present you to the Sultan in stead
of her, who questionless will be taken with that inevitable charm, which I so
cruelly have tried; And in this sort will your ambition be satisfied, as
likewise my new passion; and if you be generous, you will in that estate
remember, how I am born with this conformity of my humor to yours, to believe
that one may do any thing to become great. Let that oblige you then for your
own glory to take care of me; that a man, who has loved you, may not be in a
rank unworthy of that honor. Alicola mused a pretty while, then speaking with a
more contented countenance; Is it in earnest, said she to him, that you
propounded this unto me, or is it to discover my thoughts? and when as Bajazet
had sworn unto her, that he spoke with sincerity; she said unto him in a more
cheerful manner, at length you are come to that pass, as to be agrerable unto
me once in your life. But before you rejoice me further, tell me, I pray you
(continued she) what will he say, that gave you this Slave to present her to
the grand Signior, when he shall know that you have retained her? He shall not
know it, replied Bajazet, and I mean to carry this design with so much address,
that no body shall ever discover it. The Eunuch, and the Slaves, which serve
you, have testified their fidelity to me in other countries; and for those
which are come with me from Natolia, they cannot so much as suspect that you
are not the Slave whom they have accompanied. For you are not ignorant, that
as soon as one is destined to the grand Signior, she is treated with a high
respect, and has a veil cast over her face, which she never takes off but when
she is alone; so that according to this order, they will not wonder to see you
go out in the same sort; and whereas I purpose to have you wear the same habit
which Amurath gave to that Slave, they will doubtless take you for her. And for
language, you need not but seem as though you did not understand ours, and make
use of your natural tongue, which is the same this Slaves is. It was in this
fashion that Bajazet made an end of confirming Alicola in the hope of her good
fortune. And to say truth, it must be acknowledged that this design was not ill
imagined; for he was very sure that Alicola was not known at all to the great
men of the Port, so that if it should happen that any one of them should be
present with Soliman, when he should present her unto him, that would not
discover him: Neither was he ignorant, that those which give Slaves to the
grand Signior, never see them again after they are once entered into the
Seraglio, so that if Amurath should chance to return unto Constantinople within
eight days after, he could not find out the truth; since the grand Signior
thanking him for his fair Slave, would not describe her unto him. But hear the
success of this adventure; The resolution which I have told you of, being
taken, Bajazet calls his old Eunuch; recommends fidelity and silence unto him;
and after he had charged him never to speak of the change which he was going to
see, he bids him present Alicoles richest habit to the fair Slave, with all her
jewels, thereby to oblige her to part with that which she had brought from
Natolia, giving her to understand by signs, that Bajazet would pray her to
wear that which he then gave her the next day. The matter was executed as he
desired, the Eunuch performs his commission; and as soon as the day begins to
break, Alicola attired herself with care in the fair Slaves roab, forgot
nothing of what she thought would be advantageous to her; and covering her face
with a very thick vail, which reached down to her vvast, she suffered not her
self to be seen again, till she came before the grand Signior. In the mean time
Bajazet, before he parted, goes to the fair Slaves chamber, labors to make her
understand, that he will see her again shortly, and that in the mean space, she
may command all things there: He calls the Slaves which served Alicola, charges
them to have the same care of the person whom he leaves in their hands, as they
had had of her whom he carries away, and never to discover that which they had
seen. He adds promises of recompense to his command, and threatenings of
punishment, if they were so inconsiderate as to reveal the secret wherewith
they were trusted. After this he causes Alicola to mount into his chariot,
where for the more respect he leaves her alone, and follows her on horseback,
accompanied by those which had made the voyage of Natolia with him, who never
perceived but that it was the Salve, for as I have already declared, seeing her
of the same stature, with the same clothes, and her face being covered, they
could observe no difference. In this manner Bajazet arrives at Constantinople,
goes directly to the Seraglio, and with a daringness which is incomprehensible
to me, gives the Sultan to understand, that he was there waiting to present a
Slave unto him from Amurath, Beglierbei of Natolia, and to give him an account
also of the voyage he had made by his order. Soliman, who was then in an age,
wherein such a like news brought him as much joy, as that of a conquest,
caused him to enter as soon as he was advertised th^^^ of. Bajazet conducts his
Slave in, and after he had delivered the letters which he had in charge, he
presents her to the grand Signior, takes off the veil that covers her face, and
dexterously places her in an advantageous light. Alicola for her part, does all
that she can to render her self agreeable, and following her inclination, she
believed that an hardy and confident countenance would be more pleasing to
Soliman, than a modest shame-fastness. She beholds him then with boldness,
endeavors much to encounter his eyes; and whereas she had an haughty and proud
look, she seemed to be rather a victorious Amazon, than an unfortunate Slave.
But behold here, great Princess, the caprichiousness of fortune, who mocking at
our prudence, makes it oftentimes serve for our ruin. At first, whereas
So^iman has always been very civil, especially with women, he beheld Alicola
with an attention that gave her hope of the victory: and whereas she understood
all that Soliman said, although she made show that she understood not the
language, she was ravished to hear Soliman testify that he was much obliged to
the Beglierbei of Natolia, for having tendered him a present of that importance.
And when as this Prince gave over speaking, to consider her the better, she
imagined that this silence was already an effect of love. So that glorious of
this conquest, and not able to retain all her joy in her heart, she could not
forbear looking on Bajazet, as it were to tell him that her victory was
assured. This hope proved for all that but ill grounded, for though Alicola was
fair, though she was very young, and that Soliman was so too, this Prince,
which could never be vanquished, either in war, or in love, but only by
gentleness, felt not himself sensible of Alicolaes attracts. He considers her,
demands out of what country she came into the hands of Amurath, commends her
beauty, professes that few defects could be found in it, but at length for
conclusion, he tells Bajazet, that stoutness did never please him but in war;
and that there was something in his heart which did so mightily resist all the
attracts of this Slave, as he could not be moved with her. Alicola, surprised
with this discourse, could not choose but stroke her hand over her eyes to
assure her countenance. Bajazet on the other side, who had never thought that
Soliman could have refused a fair woman, and that feared nothing so much as to
see his design fail, was so amazed, as he could hardly speak. Howbeit he had a
spirit, that left him not long in unquietness; so that striving with himself,
after he had answered to all the questions which Soliman had asked him, he
assured him that the journey had made this Slave lose something of her beauty,
and that if it pleased his Highness to see her again a few days after, it may
be he would be better satisfied of her. Never a whit, replied Soliman, who
thinking that Alicola understood not what he said, disguised none of his
thoughts. But, continued Bajazet, may I dare, without losing the respect which
I ow to thy Highness, demand of thee what I shall write to Amurath, to let him
know what the defects of her are whom he had chosen for thee? Thou shall tell
him, answered So^^^^ smiling, that she looks more like a soldier, than a
woman; that she would be fitter to conduct Amazones to the wars, than to live
in a Seraglio; that I should fear her valor would equal mine; that when I
should give her marks of my love, she would give me some of her courage; that I
hold her more capable to make prisoners of war, than prisoners of love; and
that in conclusion, finding something redoubtable in her eyes, she has
possessed me with more fear than desire. I leave you to imagine what anguish
the ambitious Alicola was in, it was such, as forgetting all things, she
purposed twice or thrice to have spoken; and had she not been retained by the
thought, that her undoing would have been annexed to that of Bajazets, if she
discovered the trick which they played Soliman, it is certain that she had
given some marks of her resentment. And to make an end of enraging her, and
Bajazet too, the grand Signior told him, that to do an act of justice in this
encounter, he would put him in possession of Alicola, willing him to hold this
present dear; for, continued he, in this sort I testify the esteem I make of
Amuraths liberality; I recompense the care which thou have taken in conducting
this fair Slave to me; and I render her as happy as she deserves to be, since I
bestow her on a man whom I love very much, and that without doubt has some
conformity of humor with her, if her physiognomy do not deceive me. How much
Bajazet was afflicted with this discourse you may easily conceive, but though
this adventure grieved him extremely, yet was it nothing in comparison of
Alicolaes rage, who by the changing of her color showed but too much, that she
had understood what the grand Signior had said, if he had marked it. Bajazet
having perceived her unquietness, being dextrous, cast himself at his feet to
keep him from seeing her, under pretense of rendering him thanks, and testified
a great deal of joy for a thing that troubled him exceedingly. But fearing that
in the end Alicolaes grief would break forth, he withdrew as soon as possibly
he could. Scarcely was he out of the Sultans chamber, but she would have begun
to cry out, and give some marks of her choler. He speaks very gently to her,
represents to her, that she would undo her self as well as him, if by her
imprudence she should give any notice of their imposture. She holds her peace,
but not so much to obey him, nor to conserve her self, as because she was so
suffocated with choler and rage, that she t^^ught she should have burst with
it. Bajazet re-mounts her into his Chariot, an^ without going to his house at
Constantinople, he carries her back to the same place from whence she came. And
whereas he rightly judged that she would not much care to conceal her self upon
the way, he would take no body with him but he that drove the Chariot. As long
as the journey lasted she was constrained to hold her peace, because Bajazet,
who foresaw that she would say strange things unto him, rode thirty or forty
paces behind her; but when she was arrived at her chamber, and that Bajazet had
followed her, with an intent to pacify her, what did she not say against him!
against the fair Slave! and against Solim^^ I might well think (said she
beholding him with contempt) that a Prince unjust enough to love thee, would be
yet more not to love me; but I take heaven to witness, that I will cease to be
Alicola, or I will be revenged either on him, or on thee that is so dear to
him. Bajazet seeing her in this fury, did what he could to appease her; made as
though he had an affection still to her, and would have persuaded her, seeing
Heaven would not let her ambition be satisfied, to live better with him for the
future, than formerly she had done. But she, that was not in an estate to be
wrought upon, answered him with so much pride and insolence, as judging it not
safe for him to leave her at liberty in his house, he quitted her in choler,
and commanded his old Eunuch to shut her up, and not to let her go out of her
chamber, what crying or violence soever she should use. This order given, he
went to see the fair Slave, whom the Jewels which he had caused to be presented
unto her, had rendered more tractable. The kind entertainment which she gave him
was a comfort to him against all Alicolaes fury; and coming at last to
consider, that in the manner as the matter had fallen out, he might possess
this slave without concealing her, as he had purposed to have done; and that
Amurath returning, he might also see her in his hand without offense, since he
could say, that the grand Signior h^d bestowed her upon him, he was more
contented than can be expressed unto you. But to abridge this discourse as much
as possible I may, you shall understand, that Bajazets submissions put him
quickly in possessession of the fair Slave, whom he took to Wife according to
our ceremonies; and that his imposture gave him a year of felicity: For though
it vexed him to be constrained to keep Alicola shut up for fear she should
discover him, yet was it but a light unquietness in comparison of the pleasure
which he enjoyed in the possession of the fair Slave; who almost as soon as she
was his Wife, became with child, which was no little joy to him, for that he
had had no children before. Behold him then the happiest of men, according to
his opinion, and in a condition to be no longer in fear. But he knew not that
Tigers chayned are always dangerous, and that one can never be so well secured
of them, either with chains or grates, but that they are still to be feared. As
things were in this estate, Amurath was recalled to the Port by the grand
Signior, who seeing him, excused the bestowing of his Slave on Bajazet, and
told him some of the reasons, which laughing he had willed should be written
unto him: now though Amurath had not found any such haughty look in the Slave
which he had sent, yet did he not for all that suspect Bajazet of deceiving
him. Some days after his return he inquires after him, and learns that he is
seldom at Constantinople, but when the necessity of his attendance upon Soliman
required it; and that the love of a Slave, which the grand Signior had given
him about a year before, possessed him in such for, as he was scarce any longer
visible for his friends. This discourse touched Amurath sensibly; for having
had apprehensions for her, which might be termed love, yet being at that time
in no very good grace with the grand Signior, he had surmounted them, out of a
belief that he should make an agreeable present to Soliman; but now knowing
that she made up the felicity of another, his first sparckles began to kindle
again. He had without any trouble at all understood from Solimans one mouth,
that Bajazet had this Slave, but not that Bajazet was enamoured of her. And
this news so disquieted him, and moved him in such sort, as without further
delay, and without discovering what design he had in the visit which he
purposed to make, he s^^ for^h on his way to go and see Bajazet in his
retirement, with an intent to demand of him only one sight more of the fair
Slave, who being much indisposed by reason of her great belly, had stayed
Bajazet nine or ten days with her, so that he had no knowledge of Amuraths
return. The house wherein he was at that time was pleasant enough, in regard of
a fair Garden which opened into a Meadow, that had a little River running
thorough it. This Meadow was enclosed with a wall, as well as the Garden, and
the River went in and out of the Meadow by certain grates, expressly made for
that purpose. It was i^ ^his delightful place that Bajazet was walking with
the fair Slave to take the air, when as Amurath arrived there. As soon as the
old Eunuch knew who he was, he opened him the gate, sent to advertise his
Master, and would have had Amurath enter into the house, the more commodiously
to abide his coming; but finding the Court to his mind, he would needs walk
therein, staying for Bajazet. In the mean time Alicola, who had no other
entertainment but to see thorough her window what was done in the Court,
hearing it said that it was Amurath the Beglierbei of Natolia, consults a
little with her self, gets a slave whom she had gained, to bring her Ink and
Paper, and with very great speed writes a Note, folds it up as small as
possibly she could, and sends the suborned slave into the Court, to the end
that if Amurath did not receive it when she should cast it down to him, she
might take it up, and so keep the old Eunuch from finding it. This order given,
she goes to the window, and so luckily for the furtherance of her design, that
Amurath, being weary of attending, had sent the old Eunuch to hasten Bajazet
away, or to know what hindered him from coming. Alicola seeing so favorable an
occasion, and Amurath being then almost close under her window, she lifted up
the grate, and cast the note so dexterously to him, that after it had touched
his Turbant a little, it fell upon his hand, and from thence to the ground. But
as soon as Alicola had cast out her note, she let down the grate, so as he
could but only perceive that it was a woman that had shut it. He imagined
thereupon that this peradventure was the fair Slave which wrote unto him, and
that she desired to get out of Bajazets hands; in which thought he speedily
took up the paper, and being about to open it, he saw written upon the outside,
Be secret, and read not this note till thou come to Constantinople, for it
imports thee, and me too. This prohibition had not without doubt been of power
enough to restrain his curiosity, had not the old Eunuch come running to tell
him, that Bajazet would be with him presently, and how the cause of his stay
was, that walking forth a pretty way off with the fair Slave, he had been
constrained to return very softly leading her, in regard she was exceeding weak
by reason of her indisposition. Amurath concealed his note, and perceiving it
could not be the fair Slave, because she was with Bajazet, he could not tell
what to think of this adventure. At the same instant Bajazet appeared, and the
subborned Slave re-entred into the house; o assure Alicola that her note was
received. Amurath, salutes Bajazet, and the fair Slave lifts up her vail, as
her husband and she had beforehand agreed; for they had been a good while
advising as they came along whether it were fit that Amurath should see her, or
no. Bajazet, after such time as the fair Slave had learned ^ur language, had
recounted unto her the artifice he had used to possess her, the better to
testify his affection unto her. According to the resolution they had taken
then, she pulled up her vail, and said unto him, that she remembered well he had
redeemed her from the Pirates; that she owed all her felicity to him; and that
although she held her self the hapiest creature in the world, yet was she
grieved for his sake, that her defects had kept her from being agreeable to the
grand Signior. This woman spoke thus with an apparent sincerity, so well
counterfeited, as it had been hard not to have been deceived with it. And that
which rendered her so dextrous was, for that she really loved Bajazet, who on
his part made an hundred complements to Amurath, assuring him that he was more
obliged to him, than to Soliman, for the possession of a person which was
infinitely dear to him; since if he had not had the goodness to confide in him,
by giving him the conduct of this Slave, he had never been master of the
happiness which now he enjoyed. Amurath answered to all these civilities with
more liberty of mind, than he could have done, if he had not seen the fair
Slave: For finding her somewhat altered, by reason of her sickness and being
with child, his renewing flames extinguished in a moment, and tranquillity
re-established it self in his soul. Howbeit he marvelled with himself, that
Soliman should find this woman to have a proud and haughty look; for though she
had a great deal of majesty, yet was it q^^te contrary to that of Alicola;
having very much sweetness and modesty in the air of her face. But as he knew,
that one and the same thing is diversely judged of by the most part of the
world, so he made no great reflection thereupon; and the sole unquietness about
the note which had been cast him, could then trouble him. And whereas he had no
more to do in that place, seeing the fair Slave touched his heart no longer, he
shortened his visit, and after he had been two hours in the hall, talking of
the reasons which had brought him back to the Port, he took leave of the fair
Slave; for as for Bajazet, whereas he had purposed to return that day to the
City, he thought he should be uncivil in not going along with Amurath, who did
his uttermost to keep him from it; judging rightly that if they went together,
he should not read his note till he came to Constantinople; but at length he
was fain to give way to Bajazets importunate civility. As they were in the
Court ready to depart, Bajazet step^ in a little to say something to the fair
Slave, during the which Amurath stood looking on the window, from whence the
note had been thrown him. And whereas Alicola was not gone from it, she
changed her first resolution, lifted up the grate, and showing her self openly,
she joined the charms of her beauty to her requests; for if you have observed
it, all our houses are so low, that she was not far distant from him. After she
had let her self been seen a while, she saluted Amurath after the fashion of
the Country; and with a suppliant behavior seemed to demand succor of him in
some misfortune that was befallen her. Amurath finding her very beautiful,
made sign to her, that he would do what she would have him, not being able for
all that to comprehend ought in this adventure. But at last Bajazet came, and
going away together, they arrived at Constantinople just as it was night.
Bajazet waited on Amurath home, where having left him, he gave him the liberty
to satisfy his impatience. He was no sooner alone then but he opened Alicolaes
note, which in few words recounted to him all Bajazets imposture; his love to
the fair Slave; the supposition he had made to Soliman; his treachery to him;
and his rigor toward her, because (said she unto him) she had a mind too high
and generous to love an unfaithful Friend, a Love^ without constancy, and a
perfidious Subject. You may imagine now how much Amurath was surprised with
this discourse; At first he knew not whether he should believe Bajazet to be
capable of so great a treason, or whether he should think that this incensed
woman's spite had made her invent this trick, to be revenged of Ba^azet; But
passing over again in his memory, how the grand Signior had told him at his
return, that he had not accepted of his Slave, because he judged her more
proper to conduct Amazons, to the wars: than to live amongst women in a
Seraglio, and a great number of other things, which did not agree with the fair
Slave: this consideration made him open his eyes, and scarcely doubt any longer
of Bajazets treason. Withal, he had observed, in the little time that he had
seen Alicola at the window, how she had a proud and haughty look, so that this
might be she whom Soliman had refused, as she delivered in her note. All these
circumstances joined together, made him resolve to advertise Soliman of it. And
though it was indifferent late, and that it was not the custom to come into the
Seraglio at such hours, at leastwise if it were not to acquaint the Sultan with
some intelligence of importance, yet caused he him to be advertised, that he
desired to speak with him about a matter that was necessary for him to know:
But Soliman being then in the women's Seraglio, it was impossible for Amurath to
see him till the next day. Now whereas Ba^azet believed himself more cunning
than all the world besides, he never suspected that he should be discovered;
and the opinion he was in that he could not be deceived, served not a little to
deceive him. The morning was no sooner come, but Amurath returns to the
Seraglio; presents himself to Soliman at his rising; shows him Alicolaes note;
confirms it to him by all the circumstances which I have declared; and at
length persuades this truth so strongly unto him, as S^liman no longer doubting
of it, ordaines him to go the very same day and seize both upon Alicola and the
fair Slave; and to give order for the securing of Bajazet in the mean time.
Amurath, exceedingly contented with this commission, parts speedily from the
Beraglio to do things necessary for the execution of his design; which could
not be so secret, but Bajazet was advertised, that he was preparing of a
chariot to return to his house. The first thought that came into his mind was,
that Amurath was become inamoured of the fair Slave, and that he would take her
away by force. He departed then in all possible have, with an intent to remove
the fair Slave from the house, and it may be to rid himself of Alicola, not
knowing in so cross an adventure, in what place to put her for his own
security. Now though he was more diligent than Amurath, and that by a nearer
and a by-way he arrived there a little before him, yet could he not execute all
that he thought to have done; for Amurath, who had not stayed for his chariot,
was gone away with twelve armed men, so that he arrived at Bajazets house, a
little after he was entered into the fair Slaves chamber, whom he found still in
her bed: so that pressing her to make her self ready with all speed, and
re^ounting unto her in few words the occasion of his fear, he thought of
nothing but of getting her from thence, and carring her to Constantinople,
where he believed Amurath durst not enterprise such a like violence. But he was
very much surprised, when as his Eunuch came and told him that Amurath, who
knew not that Bajazet was there, required to enter in the behalf of the grand
Signior; that he espied through a chink of the door that he was accompanied
with armed men; and that to have means to advertise him of it, he had told him
that he went to fetch the k^ies to open him the gate. Bajazet began then to
change his opinion, for he was sure that Amurath durst not make use of the
Sultans name, if he had not been authorized for it. Behold him then in the
belief that he was discovered; and the better o clear himself therein, he would
have entered into Alicolaes chamber, whom peradventure he would have killed, but
he found that she had shut it. For when she saw the fright the old Eunuch was
in, and that she doubted not but her note would produce some violence, she and
her suborned slave had barricadoed their door as much as possibly they could;
foreseeing well that Bajazet would turn all his fury upon her; as indeed, he
did what he could to have broken up the door; but seeing he could not pre^ail,
and fearing lest Amurath should enter, he took the fair Slave, who had made her
self ready in have, crossed thorough the Garden, to get out at a back Gate,
without knowing as then which way to fly; and the better to amuse Amurath if he
should follow them, they shut both the gate of the garden, and that of the
meadow after them. On the other side, Amurath who would attend no longer,
caused the outward gate to be broken open; and scarcely had Bajazet shut that
of the Garden, when as he was in the house. Never was there a greater disorder
seen; the fair Slave was all in tears, and fearing she should not be able to
go, by reason of her great belly and her indisposition, she besought Bajazet to
abandon her, and to think of nothing but saving himself. But unwilling so to
do, he labored to give her some hope, and to go as fast as she could, until
they might get up both on a horse, which the slave that was faithful unto
him, was bringing them. In the mean time Alicola cried out that they would
murder her, to the end that Amurath hearing her cries, might the quicklier
enter into the house, and more easily follow them that were fled. But at last
Amurath being got in, and Alicola having opened him her chamber door,
acquainted him, how from her window that opened upon the Garden, she had seen
Bajazet escape out of a back-gate; and that it were good he should be pursued
with all speed. Amurath presently enjoins some of his men to do so; and charges
them, if they met with him, not to kill him, howsoever he defended himself.
They do as they are commanded, but finding the gates shut, they were a long
time before they could break them open; so that when they were without any
obstacle, they were not in case so easily to find that which they sought for.
They separated themselves, out of the hope to meet with him the sooner, and
omitted nothing of whatsoever they believed might be of use for this search.
Two of them indeed incountred the slave which had followed them, and that was
resolved not to re-enter into her Masters house; howbeit she served but to turn
them out of the way, which undoubtedly had brought them to those fugitives. For
not knowing that she belonged to Bajazet, they asked of her if she had not seen
a man carrying away a woman? She nothing daunted told them, that they had past
by her a little before; that leaving the ordinary road they had taken on the
right hand over the fields. This slave said thus unto them in such an ingenuous
manner, as they believed her; so that abandoning a way which would have made
them encounter what they sought for, they took another which led them far from
it. After so vain a labor, seeing the night approach, without having any hope
to perform that which had been commanded them, they returned to Amurath, who in
giving liberty to the ambitious Alicola, was constrained to lose his own, such
power had the charms of this woman over his soul. For whereas she had remembered
how disadvantageous her proud humor had been to her, at such time as she
appeared before Soliman, she constrained her inclination, and adding artifice
to her beauty, she was so pleasing to Amurath, as he could not resist her. She
related to him at length all that she had written to him in brief, and calling
him her Deliverer, with her eyes full of tears, she aggravated all the rigors
which Bajazet had used toward her, after that the fair Slave was in his hands.
She was careful to let him know, that Bajazet could never surmount her, either
with submissions or menaces; and casting her self at Amuraths feet, to implore
his protection to Soliman, lest he should punish her for being an actor in the
supposition that was made him, she moved his heart to pity; and he himself
believing that this was nothing but compassion, found it afterward to be love.
But at last Amurath seeing by the return of his people that he had no more to
do in that place, and that his Chariot was arrived a good while before, he
placed Alicola in it, together with the slave that had been faithful unto her;
and though it was exceeding late, yet they set forth on their way toward
Constantinople. Amurath caused also the old Eunch to be brought along, that he
might be made to confirm Alicolaes discourse. When they had marched a pretty
while, the night surprised them, which was so obscure and dark (for neither
Moon nor stars were to be seen) as he that drove the chariot, having never
been at this place before, lost his way in such sort, as after he had traveled
half the night in hope to find it again, he was constrained to send one to his
Master to advertise him of the fault he had committed. Amurath seeing the
Chariot stand still, believed, so little had he thought of his way, and so much
had he been taken up with his new passion, that they were come to
Constantinople; but he was much amazed when he understood the truth of the
matter, and being somewhat angry, he alighted to see if he could know the place
where they were: but in fine, it was impossible for him to discern, whether in
continuing that way, they should not go further from the City, or no. In this
uncertainty, he sent two of his men to see if they could find out any houses,
either to lodge there, or to learn of them what course they should hold: but
these two having lost their way themselves, after they had found that they
sought for, could not recover the place where they had left the Chariot. In
the mean time, Amurath having no nevvs of those he had sent, and not knovving
what to do in so cross an accident, resolved to stay the day break, or the
return of his men, before he would go on, fearing he should wander still
further, and fall into some precipice. This resolution taken, he Marshalled all
his men round about his Chariot, and advancing forth some Centinells, he
commanded them not to speak, nor to make any noise, that they might the more
easily hear any that came to them. This order given, he placed himself near to
the Chariot, with his Scymitar out of the Scabbard, to the end he might not be
surprised if any body should assault him; craving pardon of Alicola for the
incommodity she received. They had almost past the whole night in this
unpleasing stay, and the break of day began already to whiten the clouds a
little on the Sunrising side, when they heard the trampling of an horse, and
suddenly after the cry and fall of a woman. Amurath being instantly advertised
thereof, thought it might be the fair Slave; they went then afoot to that part
where they had heard this voice, with as little noise as possibly they could
make; it was not long before they heard a man speak, without distinctly
understanding what he said. But at length approaching nearer to them, they
heard how that woman conjured him to abandon her, and to think of nothing but
his own safety; how he saw well that it was heavens pleasure she should be cast
away, and that it was impossible for him to save her. At the same instant that
man's horse having got loose came amongst those of the Chariot, who thereupon
made so great a noise, that Amurath, who thought it was not fit to give Bajazet
(whom he knew by his voice) any leisure to put himself in defense, advanced
foremost of all to that place where he had heard him speak; but he had not gone
far, before he found the fair Slave at his feet, though he could not well
discern her in regard it was not yet light enough for it; Bajazet did what he
could to resist them that pressed him to yield himself: And whereas he knew not
certainly whether these were Amaraths men or no, he told them that they did not
know him, and that assuredly they were mistaken. But when he heard Amurath bid
the fair Slave no^ be afraid, for that she should have no harm, his despair was
then so extreme, as leaving those from whom he defended himself, he made
directly toward Amurath; but before he could arrive at him, he was seized upon
behind by those three against whom he had fought, who presently took his
Scymitar from him. Behold him then in the power of his enemy, as well as the
fair Slave: for thinking to do the best for their safety, they had hid
themselves most part of the day in a wood, with a resolution to travel all
night; but their horse chancing to stumble, the fair Slave fell, as I have
declared, and by her crying out discovered where she was. Amurath seeing how
lucky the losing of his way had proved unto him, and that it began to be light
enough to discern where they were, found he was not so far from Constantinople
as he thought he had been, so that considering how he might best convey his
prisoners to the City, he desired Alicola that she would make the rest of the
journey on horseback, to the end he might for his own security put Bajazet
and the fair Slave into the Chariot. To tell you, Madam, in what a taking
Bajazet was, when he saw Alicola come out of the Chariot, and behold him with a
strange insolence, I dare not undertake, neither the reproaches which Amurath
gave to Bajazet for the Treason he had committed. But at last, after they had
said all that the diverse passions which mastered their souls, inspired them
with, Amurath caused Bajazet to enter into the Chariot, and the fair Slave with
him, whose fall had brought her more fear than hurt, for she had but a little
bruise upon one of her arms. Alicola mounted then on a horse, and her slave on
another; all Amuraths people marched on both sides of the Chariot, and he with
Alicola rode four or five paces behind, as it were leading the prisoners, whom
he conducted in triumph. They arrived in this sort at the gates of
Constantinople, where having made Alicola alight, he sent her, together with
Bajazet and the fair Slave to his Palace, and there after he had caused them to
eat, he went to give Soliman an account of her voyage. As soon as the Sultan
was advertised of the state of things, he commanded these offenders to be
brought before him, which immediately was executed. You may immagine the
several apprehensions that all of them had: Bajazet was in a great deal of
confusion to appear before his Master whom he had betrayed; before a friend
whom he had deceived; before a woman whom he had loved, and that was going to
convince him of perfidiousness; but that which most afflicted him was the grief
of the fair Slave. Alicola was exceedingly vexed to appear before a Prince that
had despised her; yet did she comfort her self with the thought that she
deprived him of a man whom he loved. Amurath had his heart filled with his new
flames, which made him to be not without unquietness; for he feared that
Soliman punishing Bajazet would also punish Alicola, since she had helped to
deceive him. As for the fair Slave, the fear alone of losing Bajazet made her
shed tears: But at length, they arrived all before Soliman. And whereas none of
them durst so much as lift up their eyes, it was the Sultans pleasure they
should speak separately; and first he commanded Bajazet to render an account of
his doings. Whereupon falling down on his knees, he spoke much after this
manner; for I think that I have heard him repeat it over above an hundred
times. As love only has been the cause of my crime, so love only must also be
my defense; for, my Lord (said he unto him) I know but too well, that reason
and justice are absolutely against me. I have contemned the counsel of the
first, and I have not been afraid of the second; I have betrayed a Prince, who
is not only my lawful Prince; who is not only the greatest Prince of the
World; but who, for the greater aggravating of my fault, is a Prince which has
always loved me, and whose goodness has been so great toward me, as it has
scarce set any bounds to my hopes. Now if after so great a crime, it is
requisite to consider the rest which I have committed, I have betrayed a man
that confided in me; I have abandoned a woman whom I had loved long, and have
made her pay very dearly for the testimonies of my affection, with unheard of
rigor; and to say all, I have abused the simplicity of a Slave which was
destined to thee, and depriving her by my artifices of the honor of being
thine, I have wronged her more than all the rest. In fine, my Lord, which way
soever I turn me, I see the marks of my crime; but if notwithstanding it would
please thy Highness to consider by what violence my reason has been forced to
carry me to such strange things, thou would doubtless have some pity of my
misfortune. For if it be true that we have some compassion of a man whose
imagination has been troubled with melancholy, why shall we not have it of a
man whom love has bereaved of his understanding? What imports it whether the
cause of his folly be interior, or whether it proceeds from without? so it is,
that I have not failed, till love had seduced my reason; till I had lost my
judgment, till my will was no longer in mine own power; till all my desires
persuaded me to the crime which I have committed; till all my senses betrayed
me, till occasion favored my design; and till nothing apposing my felicity, I
had not strength enough to despise it, as I was obliged to do, seeing I could
not enjoy it without being the most faulty of all men. In conclusion, if thy
goodness will permit it, all my crimes shall be comprised in one alone word, I
have loved. I do not for all that refuse the chastisement which I merit, and
to that end I lay my head at thy feet. Bajazet had no sooner made an end of
speaking, but Alicola said unto Soliman with a bold and firm voice; as for me,
the crime which I have committed is of such a nature, as I can never repent me
of it, and the only grief I have left me is, that I have committed a crime to
no purpose. I know that in desiring the honor to be thy Slave, I wished for a
good which I was unworthy of, but I hoped that if my beauty was not able to
touch thy Highness powerfully, yet the greatness of my soul might please thee;
and I attended from mine eyes, but this only advantage to be received into the
number of thy Slaves, remitting my good fortune to the knowledge, which time
should have given thee of the thoughts of my heart. Finally, my Lord, I was
showed a way, which might have led me to glory; I followed it, and would follow
it still, had I new means presented me to do it. But if nevertheless so
noble a design deserves chastisement, I may say, that the punishment which I
have already received for it is greater than the evil I have done. I will not
reckon up the rigors of Bajazet, for I am too generous to aggravate his fault
before a Prince, whom he has but too much provoked; but I will only beseech
thy Highness to remember those cruel words, and that bitter jeere, which thou
usedst to Bajazet, when as thou did refuse me: words which I understood but
too well, though I made show that I understood them not. And to punish my self
also in thy presence, I am but to call to mind, how thou said that I was
fitter to conduct Amazons to the wars, than to live in a Seraglio; that I
looked more like a Soldier, than a woman; that thou fearedst my valor would
equal thine; that when as thou would give me marks of thy affection, I
would render thee some of my courage; and at last that I was more capeable of
making prisoners of war, than prisoners of love. Ah, my Lord, if thou knew
what a punishment that is, which a woman does resent, that is of an high
spirit, and thinks her self fair, when she hears such like things spoken of
her, thy Highness would not be troubled how to chastise me, seeing it is
certain that I carry a tormentor about me in my memory, which follows me
every where, and will persecute me eternally. Howsoever I am most ready to
obey thy Highness, and to die, that thou may be revenged of me, since I
cannot live to be thine. Herevvith Alicola made an end of her speech, and the
fair slave began hers; and though she spoke not one language perfectly, yet
was not her discourse the least couching. The rest (said she to Soliman) have
labored to execuse their crimes to thy Highness, but for me, who may not
black mine innocence voluntarily, since I cannot partake with Bajazet in his
crime, I must at least wise partake with him in his misfortune. I must (I
say) endeavor to make mine innocence appear, only to obtain pardon for his
crime. But the misery wherein I find my self is so great, as I cannot think to
save him this way, but in rendering him the more faulty. I must say then, my
Lord, that when Amurath put me into his hands, I knew not that I was destined
to thy Highness; he conducted me to his house, and retained me there without
ever suffering me to understand so much; and having rendered me all the
testimonies of love and respect, which I could have desired from a man that had
not had me in his power, I acknowledge that his affection moved me; that I gave
him mine; and that in the wretched condition, whereunto fortune has reduced
me, I esteem my self happy to be his wife, I acknowledge also, my Lord, that he
has confessed his crime unto me since; but whereas this crime was a testimony
of the affection he bore me, and that our marriage had made me unworthy of being
able to repair his fault, by restoring me into thy hands, would not thy
Highness have blamed me for coming to accuse my husband of a fault, which he
has not committed but out of an excess of love? After this, my Lord, I do not
think thy Highness can doubt of mine innocence; and not doubting of it, I dare
hope that thou will not punish me more cruelly than Bajazet, by letting me
live, and putting him to death; and that contrarily thou will have the goodness
to grant me his pardon. For, my Lord, what reason would there be, that I who am
absolutely innocent, should have the same destiny that the guilty have? Is it
not enough that fortune has forcibly carried me from out of the arms of my
parents, to put me into the hands of Pirates? that I have been sold for a Slave;
and to say all, that she has deprived me of the honor of being thine; but that
by the order of the greatest, and most equitable of Princes, I should also be
deprived of an husband, who is to me in stead of Parents, of country, of
treasures; and who in conclusion makes up all my felicity? Consider, my Lord,
in this occasion, how his crime and mine innocence are linked so together, as
thou can not be just toward him, without being unjust toward me, and how
the other way, thou may be just toward me, and clement toward him. But to
carry presumption as far as it can go, or to say better, the confidence which
I have in thy goodness, I humbly beseech thee again, that as it is I who have
robbed the unhappy Alicola of Bajazet, and that in consideration of me she has
suffered so much, so thou will likewise in consideration of me pardon him. But
if nevertheless thy Highness is otherwise resolved, grant me at leastwise the
grace that I may die with Bajazet. The fair Slave mollified the heart of
Soliman; and as he was about to have spoken, Amurath made have to say to him;
I know very well that I am the accuser of these offenders, and that in some
sort too I am a party with them; so that, my Lord, I am to be their defendor
also in this occasion, and do most humbly beseech thy Highness to pardon them:
It is an act worthy of Soliman not to be revenged on them that are in his
power; and the true felicity of Kings is without doubt to make up that of their
subjects. It will be long of none but thy self then, if thou be not satisfied,
in rendering us all four happy. For, my Lord, if thou leavest the possession of
the fair Slave to Bajazet, he will certainly esteem himself happy, as well as
she. As for me, my Lord, if the purpose which I had to tender thee a present,
that I thought would be agreeable to thee, merits any recompense, as thy
highness has been pleased to assure me, I beg the pardon and possession of
Alicola, who by what I have noted in her discourse, is more sensible of
ambition than love; so that enjoying by thy bounty, a rank considerable enough
about thee, she will have means to be satisfied, and I too; seeing I am
constrained to acknowledge, that my opinion is not like unto thine, for the
beauty of Alicola; and that I have been a whole day the most amorous of all
men. Soliman seeing him about to proceed, would not permit him, and reaching
his hand to him smiling, I am glad (said he unto him) that we are not of the
same opinion for beauty, since thereby I am enabled to satisfy thee. And for
thee, said he to Bajazet, I remit the offense thou have committed against me;
but know, that if Love combatted for thee in thy discourse, the goodwill which
I have always born thee has far better defended thee in my heart. Then
turning him to the fair Slave, he commended her generosity, and the affection
which she carried to Bajazet, assuring her that he would never trouble her
rest. As for Alicola, he told her, that to render the conquest, which she had
obtained, more worthy of her, and more capable of contenting her, he would make
Amurath grand vizier. After this he said to Bajazet, he was sorry that for the
preservation of his authority, and for example sake, he could not let him live
at Constantinople; but in regard it was impossible the matter should not be
divulged by those who had accompanied Amurath, he must needs resolve to absent
himself from the Port, for fear least this importunity should give others the
boldness to commit the like, or greater faults than this. That he did not
condemn him to go out of the territories of his Dominion, but he would have him
abide in one of the Islands of the Achipelago, and there lead a private and
particular life. To represent unto you the joy of these four persons, would be
an impossible thing, however so it was, that after they had rendered a thousand
thanks to Soliman, and that he had made them all recount the several thoughts
which they had had during the time wherein he had been deceived by them, they
departed away. Amurath conducted Alicola home to his house, where he married
her the next day, and Ba^azet went to give order for his affairs. Behold,
Madam, how this matter passed; for my husband, who as you know is older than I,
has understood it from Bajazets own mouth, whose friend he had been a long
time together. Have not you told me (said Axiamira) that you knew all these
things from a slave that was Roxelanaes favorite, whom she afterward turned
away, and that has served you a great while? Yes indeed, answered Halima, for
so much as concerned Roxelana in particular; but whereas her History depends on
her father Bajazets, I was willing to recount it unto you: And you your self
will doubtless judge, that it was not unusefull for the intelligence of that
which you desire to know. You have very much obliged me, replied Axiamira; for
certainly this adventure deserves to be known; but let us come, I pray you, to
that which regards Roxelana in particular. I shall tell you then, said Halima,
that after Bajazet had well thought of the place that he was to go and inhabit
in, he chose the Town of Chio, which bears the name of the Island wherein it
is built; it is situated in the Archipelago, and being only tributary to the
Grand Signior, is certainly one of the most pleasant Islands in the world,
either for the fertility thereof, for the sweetness of the climate, for the
beauty of the buildings, for the courtesy of those that inhabit it, or for the
liberty of conversation, which is greater in that place, than in all the rest
of this Empire. The cause of this liberty is, for that this Island is inhabited
by all sorts of Nations, so that of the diversity of their customs a perfect
one is made which holds a little of all the rest. It was in this bliss-full
abode then, whither Bajazet went to find out a refuge, after his banishment. I
have told you he had two Wives at Constantinople, but whereas he loved none but
the fair Slave, he gave them a piece of money, and restored them to their
parents, according to the permission of our Laws, and carried along with him
only the person whom he loved. He laded a vessel then with his goods, and in
the end arrived prosperously at the Isle of Chio; where he was scarcely settled,
when as the fair Slave was delivered of a daughter, whom afterward he called
Roxelana, and is the same whose adventures you desire to know. Bajazet, as I
have declared to you, was of an ambitious humor, so that after he had for a
while led an idle life, and that a long possession of the fair Slave had
quenched all those flames in his heart, ambition began to kindle hers again,
and reassumed her former room in his soul. He termed the place of his retreat
a prison; he bore his exile unquietly; and calling to remembrance all the great
hopes which he had had, he was troubled with a continual remorse for what he
had done, and anguish of mind that never abandoned him; for the more he sought
how to re-establish himself, the less likelihood he saw for it. In the mean
time the little Roxelana grevv up still, and she might be about four years
old, when as Bajazet considering her upon a day, in the midst of a great
assembly, where every one admired her springing beauty, and took pleasure in
beholding her; he heard one ask her what she would most desire in the world?
she straight answered without sticking at it, that it should be to make her
father rich and powerful. This was no sooner spoken by her, but Bajazet
coming as it were out of a dead sleep, took a resolution, which I will relate
unto you. And consider I pray you, how a weak beginning has many times a long
and dangerous consequence^ the little Roxelana was not more beautiful that day
than at other times, howbeit her fathers anguish had been so great, as one
would have thought he had never taken notice that she was the fairest and
wittiest child that ever had been seen; for as soon as he had opened his eyes,
and that the acclamations which were given to Roxelana had made him perceive
she was a Masterpiece of Nature, his heaviness diminished, and al his industry
and care was no onger, but to endeavor to make her wit as dextrous as her
beauty was charming. And truly it was not hard to bring her to what he desired;
for as she had all the beauty of her mother, so had she all the inclinations of
her father. And whereas they are perfectly discerned in that innocent age, she
that acquainted me with all these things, and that lived with her both at that
time, and afterward in the Seraglio, has told me, that in her rendrest
infancy, she had an imperious spirit, which could not endure to be controlled
by any body. She would always be mistress of all the other little girls that
played with her; and her very play was dextrous still, and malicious. She told
me further, that she was never seen to weep, nor ask for pardon, neither did
ever person tell a lie with more confidence. She was curious to know all
things, and one of her greatest delights was to see beasts fight together. This
cruel humor was for all that so well concealed, by the gentleness of her
look, as she seemed to be the most amiable child that ever was beheld. I leave
you to judge, Madam, whether Bajazet finding so toward a disposition to receive
his instructions, did not make up an accomplished work. He did not teach her to
be virtuous, but only to be careful to seem so. In her youngest years he
labored to frame her to a graceful behavior, and to entertain her always
with great hopes; to promise her that one day she should be rich, and that she
should have stately Palaces, to the end that he might insinuate into her
betimes, that Greatness was the sovereign good: and that so desiring it with
passion, she might be the more easily carried afterward to do all things
necessary for the acquiring of it. When she had attained to the age of eleven
or twelve years, and that she had a forward wit, able to apprehend his maxims,
he began to speak more plainly to her, and to tell her, that being born with no
common beauty, she was to make her self an extraordinary fortune. But as it was
the office of the eyes to obtain conquests, so it was the office of the wit to
conserve them. That all things which are gained by violence, are to be retained
by address. That it was time for her to learn to know her self, and to know
others; to the end that being accustomed to apply her mind to the diverse humors
of those she conversed with, she might one day be capable of thoroughly
disguising her thoughts: that she was not to live so out of a base compliance,
and with no other design than to please; but only to attain to some thing that
was great. With such like discourses as these did Bajazet instruct Roxelana,
whose inclinations were but too much carried to dissimulation. Nevertheless it
is true, that these dangerous lessons, which she willingly learned, were
combated by the wisdom of her mother, whom I have always called the fair
Slave, because my memory could not give you her name. This woman was good and
virtuous, and did all that she could to make Roxelana resemble her, as well in
the qualities of the soul, as in the features of the face: which Bajazet
perceiving, and having in vain forbidden her to reprehend her daughter for her
bad conditions, he fell into such a hatred of her, as he could not endure her;
and having looked upon her in former times as the object of his love, he
considered her no longer but as an obstacle of his ambition. But to keep her
from destroying that which he had established in the young heart of Roxelana,
he thought it would be requisite to make her hate her. And to that end, he
dexterously persuaded her, that her mother standing yet upon her beauty, was
jealous of seeing hers surpass it; that her reproving her, was an effect rather
of hatred than affection, and that therefore she should beware of harkening to
her Remonstrances; there needed no more to stifle all the motions of Nature in
so depraved a spirit, and to carry her to insolency. Roxelana, to obey her
father, was to do no more than follow her own humor, but to content her
mother, she was to fight with all her inclinations. The first was the easier,
and made her hope that it would produce great things; and the other being
harder, and without other recompense, than that which gives us the satisfaction
to do what we ought; she had not much ado to resolve upon the despising of
virtue, and embracing of vice. Behold her then abandoned to her own sense, and
to the evil counsels of Bajazet, and the fair Slave almost reduced to be a
Slave to her daughter, who within a while used her so cruelly, that she fell
sick with grief upon it. Now to make a trial of what she could do in
dissimulation, as long as there was any company with her mother, she seemed
respectfull, affectionate, and obedient; but as soon as they were gone, she
mocked openly at her goodness, and with an hundred bitter jeers, struck a
dagger into the heart of her that had given her life. This prudent woman was
for all that so good as not to publish the cruelty of her daughter, who in the
opinion of all them which saw her, was as virtuous as beautiful. Bajazet
seeing so fair a beginning in Roxelana, caressed her extraordinarily, and by
this cruel proceeding still advanced the death of her, whom he had loved so
much before. At last, that deadly moment, wherein she was to leave this life,
being arrived, this unfortunate one called to her the Slave, who has recounted
all these things unto me, and that had wit and some virtue, and secretly
commanded her not to abandon her daughter after her death, because it might
happen that this first heat of youth being over, she might peradventure be
capable of following the counsel which she had given her; that for this effect
she prayed her to do two things; the one was, not to bewail her death, for
fear it should oblige Roxelana to turn her away; and the other, that she should
not directly oppose her will, for fear of incensing rather than correcting her;
but to wait upon her till she was of a more reasonable age. This S^ave promised
to perform all that she desired, and indeed kept her word with her. Presently
thereupon this woman dyed, and left Bajazet in full possession of Roxelanaes
heart, who with feigned tears testified so much grief for the loss of her
mother, as she moved all them to pity that saw her, though in her mind she was
very joyful. She lived two years in this sort after the death of her mother,
being then about fifteen; during which time she was beloved of all the young
Gallants where she dwelt; she persuaded them all that she loved them, without
engaging her self for all that in any thing; and taking delight in giving them
great hopes, to put them into despair afterward, she made some dye with grief;
others killed one another by means of the hatred that she sowed amongst them,
and the jealousy which she her self gave them, when as they importuned her,
and that she would be rid of them. And all this with so much address, as all
the world believed her to be innocent of all these crimes, and attributed i^ to
nothing but the excess of love which her extreme beauty had begot in the heart^
of all those that beheld her. But at length being arrived at the age which I
have noted unto you, Bajazet called her to him one day in private; and after he
had told her, that the time was then come wherein he was to reap the fruit of
his travells, and she to put in practice that which he had so often taught her,
to the end she might that way become the chief of all the Orient. Roxelana
answered him, that he was but to explane his intention unto her, and then he
should be sure to have it executed. Whereupon he recounted all his History to
her, which she had never understood well before, and after that elevating his
voice, and taking her by the hand, Thou see then, my dear child, said he unto
her, that love did heretofore undo my fortune, and that a Slave which I took
from the grand Signior, took from me all my hopes, and banished me from my
Country. But to find out my re-establishment by the same way that caused my
undoing, love, and a voluntary Slave shall restore me into grace with Soliman.
And not to conceal my thoughts from thee, I purpose to present and give thee to
the Grand Signior, leaving the rest to fortune, and thy address. I know that
this Prince being advanced in age, is become yet more sensible of love, than he
was fifteen years ago, when as he was but nineteen; for out of the design which
a long time I have had, I have carefully informed my self thereof. He is still
young, he is handsome, he is full of spirit, he is courageous, he is liberal;
and what is most considerable, he is one of the greatest Princes of the world.
If thou make good use of the lessons which I have given thee, continued he,
and of those which I will give thee, thou may become Sultan^, and crown the
rest of my days both with honor and wealth. Bajazet stopping here, Roxelana
answered him according to his desire, and assured him, that if she could be
received into the Seraglio, she would make no doubt of the rest: and for a
conclusion, she so pressed him to part away, that in a little after having found
out a Vessel which was bound for Constantinople, he imbarqued himself in her
with his daughter, and the slave to whom her mother had recommended her; who
had so insinuated her self into her affection, as she had often believed her in
things which contraried her inclinations. At length they arrived at
Constantinople, and went to the house of one of Bajazets ancient friends, where
the day being come, in which he purposed to present Roxelana, her slave helped
to dress and set her forth, being glad to see her going out of the hands of
Bajazet, for that she was persuaded there could be no place in the world where
she would not be better than with him. But whereas the habit of the women of
the Isle of Chio is more advantageous than ours, it was in this fashion that
she was attired; and I have heard it said, that one could not see any thing
more magnificent, or more beautiful than she was in that estate. She had on a
wastcoat of silvered Damask, with two rows of Diamonds set upon a welt of
curled cloth of gold, which bordered it all about; the petticoat was of the
same stuff, and adorned in the same manner, and according to their fashion
plained very thick both before and behind, and smooth on the sides. Her
petticoat came not but to the middle of the leg, because in the Town of Chio
they much affect to show the handsomeness of it, as well as that of the foot,
which is very neat; for they ordinarily wear high Cork shoes of fine leather
of the Levant, sharp at the toes, and all garnished over with Goldsmiths work
enammelled. Roxelana had also an apron of cloth of gold, a little shorter than
her petticoat, and which was tied behind with two silver strings, whereat hung
two tassells of gold. She had upon her shoulders, as it were to fasten on the
sleeves of her wastcoat, a great many of ribbands of diverse colors, and
athwart her neck a scarf of Tiffany hanging baudrikewise, and closed together
with Diamonds, in such sort as all her neck was seen, about the which she had a
chain of Pearl, with a little jewel of Emeraulds. The attire of her head was
of cloth of silver, plaited with a great deal of address, and enriched all
over with Pearls and Diamonds: This head-tire was of a round form, and standing
up very high behind; and to hold it on the better, she had according to the use
of the Country a little gold fillet with which it was made fast behind on her
neck, where hung two tassells of the same in the midst of a great number of
knots of several colors, which fell carelessly upon her shoulders. And on the
cop of her forehead, descending a little into a peak, she had a dressing of
Cobweb Lawn streaked with gold, which also was fastened behind, leaving her hair
hanging down in curls on either side of her cheeks. In this manner was Roxelana
attired; but before he led her to the Seraglio, Bajazet would give her his last
instructions; wherefore he took her aside, and willing her to hearken
attentively unto him, he spoke to her much after this sort; for the slave, who
has told me all these things, overheard him without his perceiving it. It is
time, my daughter, for me to discover unto you the means whereby you may arrive
at the point which I desire. I have indeed said something unto you at several
times, but now I am resolved to hide no part of a Science from you, on which I
have a long while meditated. Before I show you then the ways you are to hold, I
must propound unto you the term of your pretensions, which ought not to be only
to please the Grand Signior; to make him in love with you; to be a Sultana, as
many others; but indeed to become his wife. For although none of the Othoman
Emperors since Bajazet the first has been married, because they would not share
their power; yet ought not this obstacle smother your desires, but contrarily
it ought to inflame them the more. You perceive then, continued he, that in so
great a design, there is need of a great deal of prudence to carry one well
unto it. The general precept which I will give you upon your entering into the
Seraglio, is, never to do, nor to say any thing, which tends not to this
design, either directly, or indirectly; and to remember, that all the ways
which may conduct us whither we would go, are permitted us by true reason.
Never amuse your self then in consulting, whether that which you do be just;
but indeed whether it be advantageous for you. Consider not, whether you hurt
any, but whether that which you do may serve your turn. For in fine, you go to
a place where you will meet with envyers, and enemies, and no sooner shall
Soliman be stricken in love with your beauty, but you will be hated of all the
Sultanaes. Prepare your self then to know how to make a right use of all these
things; and so do, that the hate which is born you may destroy them, who would
destroy you. Never undertake to be revenged, but when you can absolutely do it;
yea, and if it be possible, revenge your self so as you may not be suspected
for it. Moreover, Alicolaes adventure makes me remember, that Soliman is
pleased with modesty, wherefore so carry your self, as it may be very much seen
in all your actions; and beware of trusting any body. Regard every one as your
enemy, caress all your fellows, and love none of them; make not their defects
known to Soliman, but in seeming to excuse them; be careful to let him
understand by some other the malice which they bear you; be liberal to them
that are about the Grand Signior; be very submissive and pleasing to him,
until you know that you are absolute Mistress of his heart; for in fine, you
must serve, that you may reign; but then, you must change your style, and by
some artifice, which you may invent according to the time and occasion, oblige
him to mary you. And after that, whereas I have told you heretofore, how that
which is gained by violence, ought to be conserved by address, in this
encounter, that which you have gained by address, must be conserved by
violence. You are to undo all those that would hurt you, and not to spare
either Iron, fire, or poison, to maintain the power whereunto you shall be
arrived. In the mean time, to facilitate the matter, and to procure you friends
out of the Seraglio, it will be requisite for you, when you are once there, to
win Soliman with tears of tenderness to render my fortune happy, assuring him
that you cannot be perfectly contented, so long as your father is not so too.
If you behave your self in this sort, said he unto her, you shall be sure to be
very quickly the chiefest and most powerful of your sex, and the happiest
creature that ever was. Bajazet had no sooner made an end of speaking, but
Roxelana said to him smiling, that to do all those things she had no need of
his counsel, but was only to follow her own inclinations, which would carry her
to more yet than what he had told her. He embraced her then wholly ravished
with joy to see her in this resolution; and before she departed, she assured
her slave, that ere it were three days she would get her into the Seraglio for
to wait upon her, as indeed she failed not to perform it accordingly. But at
length Bajazet conducted his daughter to the Seraglio, and caused Soliman to be
advertised, that there was a man attending to present a slave unto him, without
letting him know who he was. For whereas the Officers had been all changed
since his departure from thence, and that he had not been seen in sixteen years
at Constantinople, he did not fear he should be named to Soliman. The matter
fell out as he desired; and the grand Signior, very luckily for his design,
happened to be in the best humor of the world, by reason he had received news of
a great Victory which he had obtained over the Christians. Wherefore he
presently commanded, that this slave, and he which brought her, should enter.
When Bajazet first appeared, Soliman knew him not, whether it were for that
time had altered him, or that his eyes and heart were so fixed on the beauty of
Roxelana, as he did not consider him. But as soon a^ Bajazet had cast himself
at his feet, and that he had begun to speak, the tone of his voice made him
call him to mind: He did not interrupt him for all that, but looking still on
Roxelana, he hearkened to Bajazet, without turning his head toward him.
Roxelana on her side appeared with so modest a Majesty, and so charming a
sweetness, as it had been very hard to discern the motions of her soul in her
eyes, and not to be stricken in love with such powerful attracts. But whilst
Soliman takes in so sweet and so deadly poison, Bajazet spoke to him in these
terms; I know very well, my Lord, said he unto him, that it is a crime in me to
present my self before thee, after I have been banished; and that if thou be
not the most indulgent Prince of the World, thou will not permit me to give
thee reasons for it, which may excuse me. But since thy silence seems to accord
me so much, I shall let thee know, my Lord, that this young Slave whom thou
see here, and whom I present to thy Highness as a thing that appertains unto
thee, is the daughter of that fair Slave whom I presumed to retain for my self,
though she were destined to thee. Reject her not, my Lord, since though she be
the daughter of an offender, yet is she so too of a woman that belonged unto
thee, and whose virtue has passed into her as well as her beauty. In fine, it
is a sacrifice, which I offer up unto thee, to expiate the crime which
heretofore I committed, and that also which at this present I commit. Consider,
I beseech thee, that having robbed thee of one slave, it is but just that I
should render thee another; but with this difference, that the former was thy
slave by violence, and that this same is a voluntary slave: That the other had
been in the hands of Pirates, and that this same has been always conserved as
an offering, whereof the purity ought to deface the blackness of my faults. But
if nevertheless thou judge her unworthy of this honor, I am most ready to
give thee both her life and mine own, rather than resolve to live any longer
absent from thy service, and to spend the remainder of my days without
contributing ought to thy glory. When Soliman saw that Bajazet had made an end
of speaking, he cried out, reaching forth his hand to him, O happy was that
theft of thine, since it was the cause of thy now rendering me an inestimable
treasure! For I profess unto thee, that I never saw any thing so beautiful as
thy present. Then turning him to Roxelana; and for thee, fair maid, said he
unto her, be assured that in losing a father, thou find a lover; and that in
consideration of thee alone, I will give Bajazet his liberty again, and restore
him to all his former charges and honors. Roxelana made no other answer
thereunto, than with a profound respect; but Bajazet was so over-joyed with so
happy a beginning, as he thought he should never have done rendering thanks to
Soliman. At last, after some other speeches, the grand Signior caused one of
the Governesses of the women of the Seraglio to come to him, and remitted her
into her hands, with order to lodge her alone, and in one of the fairest
lodgings in the women's quarter. And out of a particular grace, he commanded to
be given unto her the very same day, great store of jewels, apparel, sumptuous
household stuff, and money, with six slaves to serve her. And whereas she seemed
to regret one which she had, the Grand Signior caused her to be instantly
brought in unto her. But I had forgot to tell you, that when she was separated
from her father, she affected to seem good and sensible; the tears came into
her eyes, she looked after him as far as she could see him; and with this
feigned testimony of natural affection, she touched the heart of Soliman yet
more; for whereas her tears were without bitterness, they did but make her show
the fairer. But consider, I pray you, how deceitful and ill-assured humane
prudence is, especially when it works against reason and equity. Bajazet had
all his lifetime been mastered by two mighty passions, love, and ambition; the
first made him lose his fortune, when as he betrayed Soliman, and the other
made him lose his life; as if the divine Justice would not let him enjoy a
good, which he had acquired by a crime: For he had not been eight days
re-established in his charges, and Roxelana in the Seraglio, when as being gone
to visit the Bassa of the sea, who was then at Pera, where the Arsenall and
Magazine of all Maritime things were, he arrived there just as they were ready
to try fifty Cast-pieces, which were to be used in some shipping that was
shortly to be set forth. And whereas the Bassa would be present in person at
this trial, it was in this employment that Bajazet found him. After the first
complements, the Bassa told him, how that which he was going to do, was as
much to congratulate his happy return to the Port, as to acquit himself of the
duty of his charge; whereupon he commanded fire to be given: But to show that
the justice of heaven would punish Bajazet, the first piece burst asunder, and
in the midst of two thousand persons, and some four paces from the Bassa of the
sea, a shiver of that Cannon picked him out, and carried him away, with such
violence, as he was almost reduced into powder, so strangely were his limbs
dispersed. And that which is yet remarkable also in what I deliver, is, that he
was the sole man, I do not say of them that were killed, but of them that were
hurt, and how that was the only piece that burst in sunder. Behold, generous
Axiamira, in what manner Bajazet enjoyed his hopes, and the recompense which he
had for all his crimes. The news of his death was soon carried to the Seraglio;
Roxelana showed a great deal of sorrow for it; and out of a sense of interest
she was really grieved thereat. But in a few days, the marks which the Grand
Signior rendered her of his affection comforted her. For whereas she did not
regret him, but because she had believed him to be useful for her greatness,
when as she hoped that she might attain thereunto without him, she quite forgot
him; Yea and was glad that she was discharged of the care of his fortune, and
to have nothing to think of but her own. Roxolana had not been fifteen days in
the Seraglio, but she so absolutely possessed the Grand Signior, as none of the
rest of the Sultanaes could pretend to a favorable regard from him, but by
speaking well to him of her; or that he knew they had been somewhat gracious
with her; which possessed them with no little jealousy, and no less spite.
But that which vexed them more was, that they could not find occasion to missay
of her amongst themselves, whereby they might at leastwise have been eased with
this weak remedy. For she was excellently fair; she seemed extreme gentle; she
had an agreeable and entertaining wit; she was civil to the Sultanaes; liberal
to the Slaves; most respectfull of Soliman; and in all her actions affected an
extraordinary devotion. She lived a while in this sort, without any cross in
her good fortune, and with so much satisfaction to Soliman, as there was never
any joy equal to that which appeared in his humor. But at length the Sultanaes
seeing that the love of the Grand Signior was not allayed by the enjoying her,
and that contrarily it augmented daily, they combined together, and forgetting
all the jealousy and secret hatreds which they had had one against another,
they endeavored to destroy the person that destroyed them. She that incited
them the most thereunto, was the chief of the Sultanaes, the mother of
Mustapha, who at that time was brought up in the Seraglio, and was then about
six or seven years old. This wo-woman, who had a great and generous spirit,
could not endure to see, that she, who had given Soliman a Son, and a
successor to the Empire, should be less considerable than Roxelana. It was by
her interposition then, that all the other Sultanaes joined with her, and
promised never to omit any opportunity that might annoy Roxelana. This counsel,
or to say better, this conspiracy, could not be so secretly made, but that
Roxelana, by her liberality to the Slaves, which brought her presents from
their Mistresses, and that much affected her, was advertised thereof. But hear,
I pray you, in what manner she opposed this storm which was rising up against
her, and I am sure you will acknovvledge, that she was then as ingenious, as
she has been wicked since. This conspiracy nothing daunted her; she seemed
neither more unquiet, nor more pensive; and all the change which she brought
to her life was, that she never saw Soliman, without speaking some good of one
or other of the Sultanaes. She praised the beauty of one, the humor of another,
the gracefulness of this, and the stature of that; but particularly she seemed
very much to esteem of the mother of Mustapha; and so caressed that young
Prince, as it had been impossible at that time to have foreseen by the
apparences that which has since fallen out. And whereas she knew that the
mother of the Sultan had a great power over him, she won her wholly to her
self. Now Roxelanes design was, to destroy by this a^tifice all the ill which
the Sultanaes could say of her to Soliman. For said she, when he shall see that
they, for whom I do so many good offices to him, would hurt me, he will have
them in horror, and think the better of me. The matter failed not to succeed as
she had imagined it. For one of the Sultanaes, whom Roxelana had the most
commended, having understood that she had sent a little coffer full of jewels
out of the Seraglio, which is not permitted in that place, she advertised
Soliman of it, who scarcely harkening to what she said, called her ungrateful
and disacknowledgledging; and without obliging Roxelana to the justifying of
her self, he sent her a present of importance. After this, none of the
Sultanaes durst venture upon any such like adventure. But Roxelana, who was not
contented with keeping them from doing her hurt, and that placed her supremest
felicity in doing hurt to others absolutely gained to her three Slaves, two
Eunuchs, and suborned also two of the Sultanaes; who went jointly together and
advertised Soliman of this secret counsel which was held against Roxelana,
without making show for all that of her knowing any thing of it. Soliman
recompenses them for this advice, commands them not to speak of it; and whereas
this crime was too general, he resolved to punish them who had committed it,
and by one only way, which was to make Roxelana, richer, greater, and more
happy than she was. He sends for her, recounts unto her that, which she knew
better than he, by telling her what had been done against her; and in
conclusion assures her, that nothing can destroy the affection he bears her.
Roxelana, after she had heard this discourse, intreates Soliman to pardon them
this crime who had committed it; and with a false generositie so powerfully
charms the heart of this noble Prince, as it was more at the disposing of
Roxelana, than of Soliman himself. But to come to the end of my discourse, a
little while after she found her self with child, and the time of her lying
down being come, she brought forth Soliman a son, who was named Mahomet.
Until then she had never thought of any thing but maintaining her self; but
when she came to consider that Mustapha would reign one day, and that according
to the custom of the Empire, her son should be strangled; this awaked her
former ambition, and all her designs tended no longer but to be speedily the
wife of a Prince, of whom she was the absolute Mistress; to the end that in
this illustrious estate, she might the more easily destroy Mustapha, for her
son to reign. And mark a little whereunto ambition carried this woman, who
thought already of setting the Crown on the head of a child, who knew not as
yet that he was living! howsoever, it was not out of the absolute power that
she had over the mind of Soliman, that she attained to her desire, but by an
artifice which I am going to relate unto you. She knew that in one of the books
of our Religion the Sovereign is forbidden the possessing of a free woman; and
she knew also that in another, a Slave is not permitted to build either Mosque
or Hospital, or to do any other thing that may be available for the other
life. Upon this foundation she built her design; and knowing that the Muphti
carried a great stroke with the Grand Signior, she vvon him with presents,
which she sent him secretly; and so being sure of his assistance when she
should have need of it, behold how she proceeded therein. She sent to the
Muphti, who is the man that takes cognizance of all matters of Religion, to let
him understand that she had an extreme desire to build a Mosque, and an
Hospital, where all poor Pilgrims might be lodged and fed; but before she
would undertake it, she would fain know whether this would be pleasing to the
Prophet. The Muphti answers according to her desire, and as she knew that he
would answer; that the thing would be pleasing to the Prophet, but absolutely
unprofitable for the second life of her soul, because she was the Grand
Signiors Slave, and that whatsoever she had being Solimans, and not hers, all
that she should do in this estate would be to the advantage of the Grand
Signior, and not of her. This answer received, she feigns to be exceeding
melancholic, she deprives her self of all her ordinary delights; and when the
Grand Signior visits her, she lets her self be surprised still in some muse,
whereat she seems afterward to be somewhat grieved, and to strive to break her
self from it. At last she plays her part so dexterously, as the Grand Signior
began to be troubled upon his observing this change of her humor. At first he
was contented to ask of her what it was that made her so sad? but she answering
that it was an effect of her temperature, it put him into further pain. He
inquires of the slaves that serve her, whether any one has given her cause to
complain? they answer, that they know of none; but how it is true, that their
Mistress had been for a good while so melancholic, as they did not think she
could live long in that sort. For indeed when Roxelana was alone with them, she
always seemed exceeding sad, to the end that being the first deceived, they
might the more easily deceive others, foreseeing rightly, that Soliman would
inquire of them that served her, what she ailed. But because she would not be
always in constraint, she shut her self up the most part of the day in her
Cabinet; and this unaccustomed retirement served yet very much to make it be
credited that she had some hidden grief. Soliman being advertised then of all
these things, began to fall into extreme unquietness: he conjured Roxelana to
acquaint him with the cause of her sadness, and not to conceal the secrets of
her heart from a Prince, who had given his so absolutely to her; he told her,
that if any one had wronged her, he would revenge her for it; and in
conclusion, that there was nothing which she might not obtain from him.
Hereunto she answered, that the respect alone which she bore him, kept her from
obeying him, and that she had always rather die than displease him. So pressing
a discourse failed not to work the effect which she attended from it; Soliman
was mightily moved with it, and beholding her with eyes, which shared with her
in her grief, he swore that he would not part from her till he knew what it was
that troubled his felicity. She resists yet a while, he presses her the more,
and speaks to her with such earnestness, as she thinks it was high time to
discover her self. She falls then at his feet, beseeches him to pardon her, and
at last frames a discourse filled with artifice, whereby she causes him to
comprehend, that having had a design to employ the treasures which he had given
her, for the honor of the Prophet, and her own salvation, in building of a
Mosque and an Hospital for Pilgrims, she had understood that she was incapable
thereof, because she was his Slave, whereas for that purpose one ought to be of
a free condition. That she confessed unto him, how the fear of the second life
had so seized upon her soul, as she doubted she should not be able to answer
the two black Angels; and how the thought that she could never be able to do
any thing for her salvation, troubled her in such sort, as it was impossible
for her to hope for one hour of tranquillity in all her life. Soliman hearing
her say thus, lifts her up, complains for that she has so long concealed so
just a desire from him, and in the end assures her, that within a short time
she should be contented. As indeed the next day he sent her a Patent of her
Affranchisement, which he had caused to be drawn up in the most authentical
form that is used amongst us, and vvithall ordered so much money to be
delivered unto her as she would demand. Behold her then the most contented
woman that ever was, seeing so prosperous a beginning of her enterprise. She
thinks no longer in appearance of any thing but her buildings; she communicates
her designs to Soliman, who on his side esteemed himself very happy in having
been able to cure the mind of Roxelana of so black a melancholy. But when as a
little after he would have her come and pass the night with him at his
lodging, he was much abashed to see her, being alone with him, cast her self
at his feet, and with her eyes full of tears, and a voice interrupted with
sighs, hear her say unto him; I know full well, my Lord, that thou art the
Master of our goods, of our bodies, and of our lives; and that thy will ought
to be absolute Mistress of ours. But, my Lord, it now concerns the Ordinances
of Heaven, the Precepts of our Prophet, and the Law which we profess, which
will not permit thee to dispose of me being free. Give heed then, my Lord, to
that which I say, and draw not the indignation of Heaven upon thy head, for a
crime whereof I should be the cause: For rather than I will resolve to commit
this fault, I am capable of taking away mine own life, so much do I fear lest
it should prove unlucky and fatal unto thee. As long as I was thy Slave, I
never resisted thy pleasure, knowing that both divine and humane Laws commanded
me unto it: But now that I am free, and that therefore I cannot be thine,
without transgressing the Law, I think that I do as I ought in this my opposing
thee. Soliman was so surprised with this discourse, as he knew not what
resolution to take. His passion was strong, but his respect to matters of
Religion was also very great, and the tears and prayers of Roxelana fortified
it in such sort, as he resolved to obey the Law, if it proved to be so. He
sends for the Muphti, propounds the question to him, and commands him to
examine it well. But this man who had already been made, and instructed by
Roxelana, tells him that this question was fully resolved; that the Sovereign
could not possess a free woman without marying her, or without committing an
horrible crime. He reports the passage of the Alcoran to him, fortifies it with
reasons which he had premeditated, and at last leaves Soliman persuaded that he
cannot possess Roxelana without sinning. Behold him then, in a grief which is
not imaginable: For Roxelana had chosen out a time when as he was in the
violence of his love. The respect of the Law retained him, the heat of his
passion solicited him, and the example of his Predecessors, and the Maxims of
State, kept him from satisfying himself by a lawful way: For never since the
ignominy which Tamerlan caused the wife of Bajazet the first to suffer, none of
the Emperors had married, for fear lest by such a like adventure, their enemies
might a second time do that wrong to the Majesty of the Empire. What shall I
do, said Soliman, in so cross a conjuncture? If I possess Roxelana without
marying her, I shall be faulty toward her, and culpable toward heaven. If I
do mary her, I shall make all my Empire to murmr at it, I shall break an
Order established by my Predecessors with reason, and introduce a Novelty,
which it may be will cause some revolt in my Estates. Now again, if I do not
mary her, and resolve not to possess her injustly; will Soliman be satisfied,
after he has satisfied Religion, and reason of State, which ordained him so to
do? Ah, no, no, he cannot live without Roxelana, and whatsoever comes of it we
must be inseparable; and without offending Heaven, I must render her happy in
contenting my self. If my Subjects murmr at it, I shall tell well enough how
to bring them to their duty again, and teach them to submit unto the pleasure
of him, to whom they are but Slaves. This resolution being taken, he imparted
it to Roxelana, who, as you may judge, rejoiced excessively at it. Howbeit she
in appearance received this news with a great deal of moderation, saying, that
she thought her self unworthy of so great an honor. But within a few days after
Soliman married her publicly with a solemn pomp. She sent presents to all the
Sultanaes, but the Mother of Mustapha, to decline the seeing of her that day,
feigned her self sick. Now to do her the more honor, and to declare her more
absolutely Queen, and Mistress of all the Sultanaes, he caused a great Hall to
be most sumptuously furnished, where at the one end he made a Throne of four
steps to be erected, covered all with cloth of Gold, and two Cushions of the
same stuff, upon which sat he and Roxelana, who had a Crown on her head, and
her Gown set all over with Diamonds. Upon the second degree of the Throne was
the Mother of Soliman, who loved Roxelana as her self; and upon the two
lowermost, sat the sisters and daughters of the grand Signior, for he had
three by two of his slaves. Things being in this estate, all the Sultanaes came
one after another richly apparalled, to do obeisance to Roxelana with an high
respect; and for a mark of their dependence, they all brought magnificent
presents, and placed them some four paces from the Throne where Roxelana sat.
Diverse of them brought Maunds of Gold full of Flowers; others, Vases of
Emeraulds replenished with Essences; some, little Coffers, garnished with
precious Stones, and filled with Perfumes; and after they had left their
presents at the foot of the Throne, they went and placed themselves in order on
both sides of the Hall upon their knees, as it were to do homage to the new
Queen. All these Sultanaes having remained so a while, an hundred young
children, which are brought up about the grand Signior, came out of a
particular grace to the women's Seraglio, where this ceremony was performed; and
being arrived in the Hall, they began to dance, and to sing somewhat to the
glory of Roxelana; and being retired, all the Sultanaes went to kiss her Robe,
and then her hand, which she held out unto them. And for a mark of their
slavery, and her liberty, she gave to each of them a chain of Diamonds; and so
returned in the same order as they came, carrying in their hearts as much envy
and jealousy, as Roxelana had joy. As for the mother, the sisters, and
daughters of Soliman, they conducted Roxelana to the Grand Signiors lodging,
where they left her in the height of her felicities, and retired to the old
Seraglio thorough a door that opened near upon Solimans chamber. Until then
fraud and artifice were the only things which she had employed to arrive unto
the point she had desired; but alas, how well did she in this estate remember
the bad lessons which her father had given her! when as he had told her, how
that which was gotten by address, ought to be conserved by violence. For she no
sooner saw her self the Wife of Soliman, but she would needs share with him in
his power, and be acquainted with all the affairs of the Empire; she banished
from the Port such as were not pleasing to her; and for fear lest the Muphti,
whom she could not make greater than he was, should reveal to some one, that
her good fortune was not so much an effect of her devotion, according to her
own saying, as of her artifice; it was thought that she suborned one of his
slaves, and caused him to be poisoned; for he dyed suddenly; and some have
conceived that he himself was aware of it, because that having been sick not
above an hour after supper, when as he could scarce speak for the violent pains
that he felt, with much ado yet he said, that Roxelanaes Crown cost him his
life, whereupon he presently dyed. After she had secured her self on that side,
she turned her eyes to Mustapha. I think I have told you, that in the first
year of her being in the Seraglio she brought forth Soliman a son, named
Mahomet, but I am to let you understand further, that in the four following,
she had also three sons and one daughter; the next after the eldest was
called Bajazet, the third Selim, the last Gianger, and the daughter Chameria.
She had been then five years in the Seraglio, and four the Wife of Soliman,
when as they spoke of sending Mustapha forth from his Mother, because he was
twelve years old, which is the furthest age wherein men are permitted to abide
in the Seraglio. And whereas Roxelana saw how this young Prince promised great
matters, she feared it would not be always so easy to destroy him, who alone
could keep her children from reigning, when he should be out of the Seraglio,
as when he was in her hands; whereupon she plotted his death, and for that
effect, the same day that he was to depart, and the last meal that he was to
make in the Seraglio, she wrought in such sort, as there were served up unto
him certain fruits that were poisoned, and which he exceedingly loved (at
leastwise the slave, who recounted these things unto me, believed so much) but
whereas the Prince was very much grieved to part from his mother, and to see
the extreme sorrow she was in for it, he never thought of contenting his
palate; and perceiving that his mother did eat nothing, he besought her not to
afflict her self so much, and that she would eat something for the love of him.
Saying so, he presented her with some of those impoysoned fruits, which were
prepared for him, he little dreaming of any such thing. The poor afflicted
Mother, thinking it a crime to refuse her son, takes the fruit which he
presents her with, and to content him, eats it with her eyes all bathed in
tears. But the unfortunate Mustapha knevv not that he gave death to her who
had given him life; and that this crime which he committed so innocently
should be one day severely punished in his person, though he were never
accused for it: Having been in this occasion, like those innocent offerings,
upon whom in times past amongst certain Nations the crimes of all the people
were charged. The poison which Roxelana had caused to be prepared was slow, to
the end it should make no noise; and that when Mustapha should be out of the
Seraglio, and Soliman should be told that he was sick, she might make him
believe, that change of air had caused this malady. But destiny would not have
the matter go so; for in fine, not to prolong this discourse any further,
Mustapha went out of the Seraglio in good health, with no little grief to
Roxelana, who had been advertised that he had not eaten of the impoisoned
fruit. As for the mother, that never troubled her; for though she fell sick the
very same day, and dyed a month after, no body believed there was any thing
extraordinary in her death; because Roxelana had caused it to be bruited, how
the sorrow for Mustaphaes cloignment was the cause of it, and how since that
day she had never been well; as indeed she lied not: and this was so generally
believed, as the sick Sultana her self said so much to them that came to visit
her, she never suspecting any wickedness. Behold, Madam, Roxelanaes first
persecution of the Prince Mustapha: Indeed it is true, that he was not sensible
of it, for he never knew any thing of that which I have told you. Now you must
not imagine, that this violent desire which she has always had to destroy
Mustapha, whereby her children may reign, is a sense of affection for them; she
has not so legitimate a design, and the only thought which she has, is to
remain the mother of an Emperor after the death of Soliman; because she knows
very well, that this quality gives always a great credit to those which
possess it; and brings them into veneration amongst us. I should never have
done, if I would relate all her wickednesses unto you. But at length Mustapha
in spite of all her artifices lived, was brought up with great care, married an
excellent Princess of the blood of the ancient Kings of Capadocia, whom he
loved passionately, and proved, as you know, as excellent a Prince as ever was.
And the hate which she bore him could not keep the Prince Gianger from having
as much good will for him, as she had aversion. But to strengthen her self
still the more, as soon as her daughter had attained the age of thirteen
years, she got Soliman to mary her to the traitor Rustan; who for all that
has not forborne often betraying her self, for he seeks his own greatness, and
not hers. Behold, Madam, what the first wickednesses of Roxelana have been, for
as for the rest, you know them but too well. And it may suffice, that I have
only showed you her inclination. This woman never incountred person that
opposed her violences, but the grand Vizier Ibraehim, who ever since he has
been amongst us, has had so much power with Soliman, as she could never, he
being the most virtuous of men, make any of her wicked devices succeed, either
against him, against Mustapha, or Gianger (for he loved them both dearly)
until such time as for our ill fortune, he went away, some six months ago,
upon a secret expedition, whereof all the world talks diversely; for seeing the
mischiefs which have arrived by his absence, it is feared lest she has caused
him to be murdered by the way. It being very certain, that if he had been
here, the rage which she had long shut up in her heart, had not broken out so
deadly as it has done. Alas! said Axiamira interrupting her, how much has he
whom you speak of been wished for in vain of the Prince Gianger! And how often
has he spoken to me of him with a world of praise! But mother, continued she,
you have recounted so many things unto me, as Soliman me thinks should be above
an hundred years of age, and yet he seemed not so old unto me on that unhappy
day wherein I saw him. It is, answered Halima, because I having enchained two
Histories in one, and begun to speak of Soliman at the age seaventeen years,
your mind, by the length of my narration, and the number of things which I
recounted, has thought that which you say. But if you please, I will let you
see the contrary: Soliman was seaventeen years old, when Bajazet put the
supposition of the Slave upon him; at the end of sixteen years, when Roxelana
was presented unto him, he was thirty and three, she fifteen, and Mustapha
seven: So that if you are ignorant of all these things, you will find, that
Roxelana is not above seven and thirty years of age, Mustapha was nine and
twenty, Gianger eighteen, and Soliman is fifty and four, though he seem not to
be more than forty. And that which is strange in this Prince is, that he is at
this present of a more amorous humor, than he was in his younger years. I
shall not have much ado, answered Felixana, who had not spoken yet, to believe
that which you say; and I know but too well by mine own experience, that there
are men in whom age does rather stir up passions, than appease them. With such
like discources, Halima endeavored to divert the Princesses melancholy; but
remembering that she had not eaten any thing of all that day, she went to give
order for the serving up of dinner. On the other side Ibrahim, who had not
forgot the design which he had, and the request of Ulama, after he had spent
part of the morning at the Divano, which was held that day, and the rest of it
with the Grand Signior, without speaking of any other thing than the war of
Persia, he returned to his Palace, there to take along with him the Slave which
Ulama had sent to him, that he might carry him to the Castle of the seven
Towers, whither he went with an intention to ease the miseries of others, since
fortune would not let him find a remedy for his own.

The end of the fifth Book.
IBRAHIM: OR, THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The Third Part.
The First Book.
WHen as Ibrahim arrived at the Castle of the seven Towers, where Axiamira and
Felixana were prisoners, he commanded the gate to be opened to him, as they
used in times past to do, when he came to visit Prisoners of State. But whereas
the Governor of that place had not understood of the grand Visiers return,
there had been no order taken for his entrance; howbeit his people had no
sooner advertised him of his being there, but he came to let him in himself,
and to crave pardon for making him stay so. Ibrahim, having accepted his
excuses, sent him to advertise Axiamira of his arrival, and to know of her,
whether he might have the permission to see her. This man failed not to obey
the commandment he had received, but this news so surprised Axiamira, and the
imagination, that she was ready to see a man, whom Prince Gianger had loved so
much, troubled her in such sort, as being but in a weak and languishing state
of health, the violent motion of her thoughts h^d like to have made her fall
into a swoon. Not finding her self then in case to entertain Ibrahim, she sent
her dear Felixana to excuse her unto him, and to desire him to pardon her, if
she were constrained to retard a thing, which she desired so passionately.
Felixana acquitted her self of this commission with a great deal of address, and
entertained Ibrahim at Italima's lodging. But after the illustrious Bassa had
received Axiamira's civilities, and had told Felixana, that coming but to offer
her his service, he should have been very sorry to incommodate her, he
perceived the unquietness, which appeared in the face of Felixana. For whereas
he had commanded Vlama's Slave to follow him, she had no sooner saluted
Ibrahim, but casting her eyes on this Slave, she changed color. And scarce
harkening to the Bassa's complement, she considered this man, whom she was
persuaded she knew, without daring for all that so much as believe absolutely
it was he whom she thought it was. Ibrahim seeing her in this incertainty, was
willing to draw her out of it, and addressing his speech unto her, as he led
her to the window; I perceive very well, amiable Felixana, said he to her, that
this Slave is not unknown to you, but to take you out of the doubt wherein I
see you are, I will let you know, that this Slave has not changed his Master,
and that his Master too has not changed his Mistress. And to confirm unto you,
continued he, that the valiant Vlama is still the Lover of Felixana, read this
which he has done me the honor to write me; to the end I may afterward the
more easily persuade you, that I came hither with a purpose to render you all
the services you shall desire of me. Saying so, he presented her with Vlama's
Letter. I know, my Lord, said she unto him, taking it, that I shall do you
wrong in desiring to have mine eyes confirm that unto you which your words have
assured me of; but, my Lord, I am so accustomed to see my miseries every day
increase, and Fortune for a long time has so obstinately persecuted me, that
you are to pardon me the doubt I am in of my happiness; since it is in me
rather an effect of my sense, then of my reason. Whereupon she opened the
Letter, which straightway she knew to be Vlama's hand; and having read it over
with a great deal of satisfaction, Ibrahim caused the Slave which he had
brought with him to approach, who casting himself at Felixana's feet, would
have kissed her robe, but she reached forth her hand unto him, and commanded him
to rise. Halima seeing all these things would have gone out of the chamber, but
Felixana perceiving it, called her back again. It is but just, said she unto
her, that as you have been the only consolation which I have found in my
misfortunes, so I should not conceal from you the succor which Heaven sends me
after many miseries. Halima obeying Felixana's pleasures drew near again, and
saw Vlama's Slave, after he was risen, give her a Letter, and then say unto
her; You shall see, Madam, by that which my Master writes you, that I have
order to recount unto you all that you desire to know of his life; to render
you an account of his actions; and to assure you that this illustrious Bassa,
said he, pointing to Ibrahim, is the only Protector that you can have. Of this
protection she is so sure, replied the grand Vizier, as she cannot doubt of it
without doing me an injury. In the mean time Felixana unsealed Vlama's Letter,
and having opened it, found this written.

ULAMA'S Letter to FELIXANA.
FOrtune not contented to make me suffer all your miseries in acquainting me
with them, has yet for my supremest mishap kept me from being able to succor
you, or at leastwise to partake in the calamities wherewith you are
overwhelmed. For though I have the Arms of the Empire still in my hands, and
that I cannot quit the Army, without incensing him whom I am to obtain your
liberty; yet feel I that it would have been impossible for me, not to have gone
and laid my head at his feet, thereby to have obliged him to take compassion of
our misfortunes; But the wounds which I received in the last fight I was in,
utterly depriving me of the power to perform that, all I can do, is to wish
that the blood which I have spilt in the service of Soliman, may at leastwise
spare your tears. Nor do I despair yet of so great a happiness, if the
illustrious and generous Ibrahim does undertake to protect you, as I have
besought him to do, and as I dare not doubt but he will. Confide then in him
for all things; acquaint him with all our past felicities, that he may have the
more pity of our present adversities. And to say all, follow his directions
exactly, seeing his generosity is the only thing that can yet make me desire
life, by the hope it gives me to see you at liberty again; this Slave, which I
send you, can tell you what a one that has been which I have led, ever since
that fatal day, which separated me from the incomparable Felixana, and can also
assure you that I will adore you eternally.

ULAMA.


Felixana had no sooner made an end of reading this Letter, but she desired the
Bassa should see it, though out of civility he would not; telling her that he
would rely more on her word, then she had done on his, and that he would
believe that which she would please to let him know. But she answered him, how
it would not be just that he should do so, and therefore besought him to read
it. Whilst Ibrahim obeyed her, Felixana enquired of Vlama's Slave, whether his
wounds were dangerous? And when he had answered her, that they had been so, but
were past the worst, and that if it had not been for one in his leg he might
have quitted his bed, she asked him other questions, until such time as the
grand Vizier, having done reading of Vlama's Letter, said to her with a great
deal of civility: It is for you, Madam, to furnish me with means to serve you,
and to acquaint me with all your misfortunes, to the end that knowing them, I
may the more easily find necessary remedies for them. But I know, fair
Felixana, that this is to constrain your inclination, and that you had rather
talk with Vlama's Slave, then renew your sorrows by calling them to
remembrance; but to comfort you, I will promise to leave this Slave with you,
until we have some pleasing news to send Vlama. Felixana thanked him for this
favor, and assured him, that she had no greater desire then to obey him, though
the remembrance of her miseries would augment them; and that it may be they
would afflict him too. For my Lord, said she unto him, my adventures are so
intermingled with those of the Princess of Persia, and of two Princes whom you
have dearly loved, as I am constrained to recount them; seeing it is certain
that mine make but a part of theirs. Ibrahim was glad to see her in this
resolution, for he hoped he should know that by her, which Soliman would not
tell him; so that causing her to sit down, and Halima by her, he summoned her
to the performance of her promise, which she accomplished in this manner.

The History of the Princess AXIAMIRA, ULAMA, and FELIXANA.
THat which you desire to know of me, generous Ibrahim, has cost me so many
tears and sighs, that if I did not strive to turn away my thought from the last
adventures of this History, it were impossible for me to relate the beginning,
where you will find nothing but the hopes of an extreme felicity for me. But
to take things from their first source, and to render my discourse more
intelligible, I am to tell you, that Scach Tachmas, whom we call the Sophi,
otherways King of the Persians, remained a widower almost as soon as his wise
(who, as I have heard say, was an excellent Princess) had brought him two sons,
Ismael, and Mahamed, whereof the last is blind; and two daughters, of which
the one is the Princess Axiamira, or to say better, the wonder of her age; and
the youngest, named Perca, is of an indifferent beauty, of a malicious humor,
and of a mind incapable of any kind of friendship. As for Ismael, it might be
said, that as he has no great virtues, so he has no great defects, and that
he is in the rank of those persons, who do almost pass away their lives so, as
they can hardly be known to live, if their quality did not make it appear that
they are in the number of the living. Now for Mahamed, the same cannot be said
of him, but contrarily it seems, that Nature has deprived him of the light of
the day, to make it shine the more in his mind: For whether it be that this
privation of sight is the cause of its better recollecting it self, and
operating with the more activity; or that his memory, which is so marvelous in
him, as it may be thought he has never forgotten any thing, does furnish him
with that which renders him agreeable; so it is that his conversation is so
charming, as one can never be weary of it. But that which is most excellent in
him is, that he is exceeding virtuous, and that his passions, though violent,
have never surmounted his reason. Behold, my Lord, what the royal Family was,
when I was brought to the Court, which was at that time in the City of Tauris.
My Father had always been considerable enough in this Monarchy, and the Sophi,
to testify the esteem he had of him, had made him Governor of Strabat and
Mazanderon, two very fair Towns, which are situated on the bank of the Caspian
Sea. But whereas my Father had married the sister of the Governor of Tauris, it
was by his means that I was put to Axiamira, with a many other maids of a
condition equal to mine, which were divided between those two Princesses; and
were with them, as one might say, rather to help them to pass away the time,
then to do them any service. Axiamira might be about fourteen years of age, and
I fifteen; and whereas she was younger then the Princes her Brothers, Mahamed,
as I think, was not far from sixteen. But to let you first know all the persons
of whom I am to speak in this History, I shall tell you, that there was at the
same time in the Court, one named Deliment, whose birth was not very noble; but
who had, by means of his high spirit, and extreme riches, so wrought himself
into the Court, and good grace of the Sophi, as there was none but was afraid
to be in ill terms with him: I say afraid, because it is certain that no man
desired his friendship, but for fear least his hatred should be prejudicial
unto him; and truly it is not to be marvelled if one could have no other
opinion of him, for he was insolent, ambitious, undertaking, believing there
was scarce any thing worthy of him, easily offended, never pardoning, and that
which rendered all his bad inclinat^ons more dangerous, was, that he had a great
wit. Now if Deliment were of this humor, Vlama was opposite to him in all
things, for his birth is noble, as being the chief man of Caramania; his
courage is without brutishness; and whereas you have not seen him but since he
was unfortunate, I conceive I may be permitted to tell you what he was during
his felicity. When I arrived at the Court nothing was spoken of but the valor
of Vlama; for it was a little after the War of the Azemites, where having done
wonders, and to say all, been the cause of the Sophies carrying away the
victory; to recompense him for this great action, he made him Satrap of
Caramania at two and twenty years of age, and gave him his sister in marriage,
whom Vlama espoused rather out of obedience, then out of inclination; it being
certain that this Princess, as the incomparable Axiamira has oftentimes told
me, had nothing recommendable in her but her birth. And indeed, as if Heaven
had found this marriage unjust, a month after it was accomplished she dyed of a
burning Fever: And whereas it is the custom of the Kings of Persia to have all
the royal Family lodged in one and the same Palace, Vlama, as brother-in-law to
the Sophi, was lodged there too; so that though the women live very straightly
kept all over Persia, yet left we not for all that to have a great deal of
liberty, and to lead a life happy and pleasant enough; having in the same
Palace, the two Princes and Vlama, whom we saw as much as they pleased: for the
Sophi had ordained that the Princesses lodgings should be open to them when
they would, I and that all the Satraps young sons might see and speak to us
when as they accompanied the Princes. Things being in these terms at such time
as Vlama's wife dyed, the Princesses went by the commandment of the Sophi, a
little after the Funeral, to give a visit to Vlama, whom I had scarcely ever
seen, because I had not been above a month at the Court, and that during the
same the Princess his wife had still been very sick. I have already told you,
my Lord, that Vlama had not loved her, and I put you in mind of it, to the end
you may not think it strange if in this occasion Love took his beginning in the
time of a mourning, which had not drawn any tears. Axiamira and Perca made this
visit with ceremony, the young Princes conducted them, or to say better, Ismael
held up Axiamira, and Perca led Mahamed, who, as I have told you, was blind
from his birth, though he had the fairest eyes to see to in the world; but he
let himself be guided with so much address, and went along with so confident a
pace, as there was no body but would have been deceived in him. All the maids
of honor followed after, as also six Ladies of quality, reasonably well stepped
in years, which had been placed about the Princesses, to have a care of their
behavior, and ours. And truly it must be acknowledged, that Feasts of rejoicing
do seldom show any thing more goodly to behold, then the mourning which is in
this Court; for whereas black is not in use there but when one mourns, if any
of it be seen about ones apparel, it suffices; nor is it exempted from
magnificence. We were all then attired much after one; and to excuse Vlama so
much the more, for letting himself be touched with those few charms which you
see in my face, I will describe Axiamira's habit unto you, that you may know
what mine was; for she had already taken so great a liking to me, as she would
have no other difference between her apparel and that I wore, but great store
of Diamonds which she caused to be added thereunto whenever she pleased; and
withal, since that fatal day did beget love in four such different hearts, it
will not be amiss for me to recount unto you all the particularities of it.
Axiamira then had on a petticoat and wastcoat of cloth of silver very
glittering, and over that a gown of black Tiffany exceeding fine, whereof the
body was plaited, so that it showed the shape very perfectly; and the bottom of
the skirt, which was cut in peaks, made way for the cloth of silver to be seen
athwart it. The sleeves were indifferent wide, but to give more liberty to the
arm, they were fastened upon the shoulder with clasps of Diamonds, leaving
almost to open view the cloth of silver sleeves that were under. Her Girdle was
of great Pearls enchaced amongst Diamonds: And behind at her back were
moreover two hanging sleeves reaching to the ground, bordered with large
borders of silver Embroidery, as well as the lower part of the Gown. Her neck
was half hid with most delicate black cobweb-lawn, which was tied on her
shoulder with a silver string. And whereas our dressing is very high, there
hung from the top of her head behind a great vail, trailing to the very
ground, of silver Tiffany, streaked with black, and carelessly plaited; which
certainly gave a great deal of grace to the beauty of Axiamira, and also
supplied that little which I had.

We went in this sort then to Vlama's Lodging, which, according to the custom
of Persia, that will have the houses, whereof the Masters or Mistresses be
dead, to are for six weeks deprived of the light of the Sun, had no other Light
but that of Lamps. For whereas Vlama was of a condition to observe all
requisite Ceremonies; and that it was the sister of the Sophi, for whom he
mourned, we found him in a chamber, hung with black Tinsel, streaked with gold,
and enlightened with an hundred lamps of crystal. Deliment was at that time
with Vlama, who was likewise attired all in black, except it were that which we
call Caselbas, or red Turbant, which is never permitted to be left off, but
only to be covered with a black Cipres. I must confess that I never saw man of
so goodly a presence in Persia, as Vlama was in that occasion. He received the
Princes and Princesses with so much address and grace, that all my fellows were
ravished with it. But when he had caused them to sit down, and that we had
ranked our selves on the other side of the chamber, where we remained standing,
I soon perceived that if I had thought him handsome, he did not think me
disagreeable, seeing that every time civility would permit him, he fastened his
eyes so on my face, as I was constrained to turn away mine; which made me
observe how Deliment took more then ordinary care to entertain Axiamira; for
this man of blood and fire had not till then looked upon any woman, but to
despise her. And as if this chamber had had some fatalness to enchant the
minds of those that were in it, the Sophi himself came to visit Vlama, whilst
we were there, and for my ill fortune, he beheld me so favorably, as I past
with him for the fairest thing that ever he had seen. But whereas the time was
not proper for gallantry, all these springing passions were no otherwise made
known then by looks, except in Deliment, who when the Princess happened to go
away, and that Tachmas was retired, advanced to lead Axiamira, whilst Ismael
was yet talking with Vlama. She, that thought the Prince her B^other would
tarry behind, received him with her ordinary civility, although she was
extremely averse to him. On the other side, Ismael having finished his
complement, gave his hand to Perca, who, without thinking how the blind Prince
had not brought his ordinary guide along with him, suffered him to lead her; and
whereas Mahamed perceived it, and was very dextrous, he made his discourse
endure as long as he could out of hope that some one or other would lend him
their hand to conduct him. I confess that having marked the pain he was in, and
moved with pity to see so goodly a Prince, so handsome, so sprightly, and so
amiable, in the unquietness wherein I saw him, I stepped to him, without
demanding permission for it of the Governesses. My Lord, said I unto him, the
Princesses are gone, will not you be pleased to follow them? He that knew me by
my voice, Yes gladly, discreet Felixana, said he unto me, if you will have the
goodness to lead one that is blind, who notwithstanding his blindness cannot
but know your merit. I observed by Vlama's countenance, that he had a desire to
have spoken a gallantry to me thereupon; as indeed he has since assured me,
that civility only kept him from it; but in fine I led Mahamed to the
Princesses Lodging, for the which he was so obliged unto me, as that which the
eyes of Axiamira had wrought in the heart of Deliment, and mine in that of the
Sophi and Vlama, my courtesy effected in Mahameds; who from thence forward
began to have an inclination for me, which might well be termed blind, since
if I had had any thing that was agreeable in my face, yet could he not have
been touched with it, being not able to see it; and as for wit, I was in an
age, which ordinarily is not capable of making great conquests. Indeed it is
true, that my complying with him might render me pleasing to him; for whereas
all my fellows were not of my humor, they, when Mahamed was with Axiamira,
declined his conversation, or at leastwise applied not themselves to it, and
this, out of the thought, that being incapable of seeing their beauty, they
believed him to be also incapable of love, and for this reason, they would not
lose that time with him, which they thought might be better employed in the
entertaining of all those young persons of quality, which accompanied the
Princes to Axiamira. As for me, who cared not as yet, either for loving, or for
being loved, I gave my self only to things that pleased me; and whereas I was
infinitely taken with the conversation of Prince Mahamed, and that generosity
it self carried me thereunto, I set my self as often as I could to talk with
him, but that which engaged me yet farther to this compliance, was, that the
Princess Axiamira loved him dearly; for whereas Ismael and Perca were unworthy
of her affection, the first for the defects of his spirit, and the other for
her malice, she had placed all her liking on Mahamed; so that when the Princess
could not entertain him her self, she commanded me to stay with him, which I
did with a great deal of joy, because there was nothing of more power at that
time in my mind, then the desire to please the Princess, who in all her
actions seemed to prefer me before all my fellows. On the other side the Sophi,
who would fain know, whether I would be as agreeable to his eyes in the
Princesses Lodging, as he had found me in Vlama's; or whether the shining of so
much light, and that chamber hung with black, had not served to deceive him,
used to come sometimes to the Princesses, without giving me notwithstanding any
greater mark of his affection, then to behold and commend me more then the
rest, when occasion was presented for it; for whereas I was very young at that
time, he durst not, as I understood afterward, speak plainly to me of his
passion, fearing I should not be discreet enough to conceal it from others. But
whilst he attended the improvement of my reason, the time, whereunto the
ceremony of mourning had confined Vlama, being quite expired, he came to render
his duty to the Princesses, and to thank them for the honor they had done him;
and whereas I was almost never absent from Axiamira, he saw me in her chamber,
and by a second view confirmed himself in the advantageous opinion he had
conceived of me; and so strongly resolved to love me, as fearing he should be
obliged to dislodg from the Palace, because the Princess his wife being dead
without children, he was scarcely any longer of the royal Family; he purposed
to endevor all he could to discover his affection unto me, for fear he should
be deprived of the commodity of doing it so easily, if he were constrained to
be gone from thence. As for me, I confess to you blushing, that in this visit
which he gave to the Princess, I felt a desire arise in my heart that I might
be pleasing unto him; and without making any reflection on this thought, I
remember well, that although it had been a great Court that day, I never
thought of heeding my apparel; but as soon as Vlama was entered, I observed my
self with care, and without knowing any reason for it, I would have been glad
that I had been better dressed then I was. But in fine, my Lord, two or three
hours after, Fortune was so favorable to Vlama's design, as having found me
alone in the Princesses Chamber, who was shut up in her Cabinet, he spoke to me
of his affection with so much passion, as I knew not what to answer him, having
never met with such like encounters. And whereas his speech had ever since
remained in my memory, and that it has been the beginning and cause of all my
pleasure, and of all my misery, I cannot forbear repeating it unto you. He no
sooner entered into the chamber, but I advanced toward him, to let him know
that I was very sorry for that he could not see the Princess as yet; and that
having forbidden me interrupting her, I durst not advertise her of his being
there. Do not afflict you self, fair Felixana, said he unto me, for a thing
which is infinitely pleasing to me; and if you will render me perfectly happy,
trouble not my good fortune in doubting of this truth. What, said I unto him
exceedingly surprised, do you come to see the Princess, and yet are glad that
you cannot meet with her? truly this seems so strange to me, as I cannot
comprehend the reason of it. It is not for all that very difficult to find
out, answered he me, for I come to see the Princess Axiamira out of duty, and
the beautiful Felixana out of inclination: I am her subject, but I am your
servant, and that in such sort, as you shall reign eternally in my soul, there
being no kind of service which I will not render you with joy; and henceforth,
continued he, receive, fair Felixana, all the duties which I shall tender to
the Princess, as appertaining to you; and believe that I am ravished with
finding you thus alone, whereby I have had the opportunity to make this
Declaration unto you. This discourse surprised me in such manner, as I should
have been much perplexed to have answered it, if Axiamira had not at the same
instant called me, so that being pressed to obey the Princess, all that I could
do, was to tell him, that knowing him and my self too, I should always be able
to discern how to believe that which was fit for me to believe, both for his
glory, and mine. But, my Lord, without particularizing all these things unto
you, it may suffice me to tell you, that in six months space Vlama gave me so
many marks of his love and discretion, as I should have been ungrateful and
insensible, not to have rendered him some testimony of my goodwill; and whereas
I was neither the one nor the other, Vlama received from me all the proofs of
friendship, which virtue could permit me to give him; and I may say that this
was the only time, wherein I lived with pleasure. And truly I must confess
that the life which I led was happy enough; I saw my self favored by the most
amiable person that ever was; caressed by the Sophi; esteemed of Mahamed; and
passionately beloved of Vlama, who without contradiction, surpassed all that
were at the Court in that blessed time. Prince Mahamed resolved then to declare
his passion overtly to me; so that one day, when the weather was very fair, and
that according to Axiamira's custom we were gone down into the garden, she sent
to desire Mahamed that he would come and walk there; and when he was come, the
gentleman which led him, was commanded to withdraw, that they might talk with
the more liberty. Axiamira having willed me to lend Mahamed my hand, he let
himself be guided by me, and the Princess leaned on him. After we had walked a
pretty while some ten or eleven paces distant from the rest of my fellows, who
out of respect durst not follow nearer, having well observed, that the Princess
was not willing they should. Mahamed first speaking, asked of her, whether it
was to say nothing unto him that she had sent for him; it being certain, that
all the while we had walked together she had not spoken a word; for, continued
he, my dear sister, whereas I do not see but with the eyes of my mind, if you
have a purpose to entertain me, it must be with your discourse, since walking
c^n have no other charm for me then what I find in going along with you under
the conduct of the discreet Felixana. My silence, answered the Princess, will
trouble you less it may be, then my discourse; seeing I know you too generous,
and Felixana too wise, and too affectionate to my service, to conceal my
misfortunes from you. It is certain that I was very much surprised to hear the
Princess speak in this sort; for though she had been a pretty while past
somewhat sadder then she used to be, yet perceiving no apparent cause for it, I
had attributed it to one of those melancholies without a cause, which seizes
upon all the world at one time or other, and proceeds from ones temperature;
but when as going on in her speech she acquainted us, that ever since the visit
which she had given to Vlama after the loss of the Princess his wife, and that
Deliment had presented her his hand to lead her to her lodging, as I remembered
very well, he had been so audacious as to speak diverse times to her of love,
although she had at the very first very severely forbidden him; my amazement
ceased, knowing well enough the extreme aversion which she had for Deliment,
and how much her great heart ought to be incensed, that a man of a birth so
unequal to hers should be so daring, as to lose the respect which he owed unto
her. As for Mahamed, who knew but too well, by the report o^ some of his
servants, that Deliment slighted him, he was so netled, as he could not forb^ar
saying aloud: How, sister, has this Insolent lost the respect which he ows to
you? Yes, replied the Princess, and in such a manner, as even to day, when as
the Sophi brought him along with him into my chamber, upon protext of talking
with me about an affair, which I did not find was very necessary for me to
know, he stayed there behind him, and had the insolence to let me understand by
his obscure discourses, that the greatest happiness could arrive to me was to
be his wife; because, said he unto me, so you may one day be the Sophies. For
the truth is, Ismael knows not how to reign; Mahamed is so far from guiding of
an Empire, as he cannot guide himself; and Perca will not peradventure find an
husband, able to dispute the Crown of Persia against Deliment, who does not
tell you all these things without reason, nor without a good ground. Judge now
after this, said Axiamira to us, what I should have answered him, if he had
given me leisure for it, but he went away so speedily, and I was so confounded,
as I could not open my mouth. Now though this insolent man has fi^led me with
choler and despite, yet is it not that which disquiets me; and had I nothing
but his pride, his love, and his ambition to fight with, I should easily
surmount such weak enemies; but that which amazes and afflicts me both together
is, that an hour after Deliment hid left me, Ismael and my sister came to me
into my Cabinet, whither I had retired my self, and spoke so much to me of the
affection which Deliment bore me, of his great courage, of his wit, and of the
excellent qualities that were in him, as I remained quite confounded therewith;
and had I not purposed to take your counsel in this affair, it is certain that
I would have learned of them what obligation they had had to him whom they
protected so: and then again I am fallen into some fear, that my sister has a
great share in Deliments fault, for reasons which I cannot comprehend; for I
know that a good while now together she has oftener accompanied Ismael to his
lodging, then to mine. Ah, my dear sister, cried the Prince, that I had my
brothers eyes, or that he had Mahameds heart I you should soon be revenged of
this insolent fellow; and the loss of his life should in a few days restore
yours to its former tranquillity. I know very well, replied the Princess, that
you are as generous as Ismael is weak, and my sister malicious: but in fine
being able to do no other thing, you are to counsel me, and you and Felixana
are to consider well that the Sophi loves Deliment passionately; that he
brought him not without some occasion into my chamber; that although he be
wicked, yet he has wit; that consequently he must needs know that his
insolence is upheld by some body; that Ismael and Perca are of his party; that
they hate Vlama because he is of ours; that the Sophi our Father is not
sensible of love to his children; and that the passions, which predominate in
him, prevail with him over all things. Just hereupon we saw Ismael, Perca, and
all her women appear afar off, so that to show there was no mystery in our talk
she went to meet them, and going away prayed us, that we would fever our selves
far from all others, to think of that she had said to us, and that in the
Evening I should tell her the resolution we had taken. I led Prince Mahamed
then into another alley, where we were still for all that in the sight of the
Princesses; and there, after we had well considered the matter, we resolved,
that it was needful, before it should break forth, to discover, whether the
Sophi authorized the love of Deliment; whether Ismael and Perca had any
intelligence with him, or any interest in this love; that for this effect Vlama
was to be made use of for so much as regarded the Sophi; and that I on my part
should endevor to know the secrets of Perca, by the means of a maid whom she
had loved very much, and who did not hate me; and that when we knew the truth
of the business, it would be far more easy for us to remedy the same; for in
fine, said I, if the Sophi does not protect Deliment, he will be lost as soon
as he understands of his insolence; and if Perca be not interested in this
affair, the discourse which he has used to the Princess will quickly make her
change party, when she knows it: but if the Sophi, as it is very likely, has
given some secret hopes to Deliment; and that Perca on the other side has any
share in this adventure, it would be to no purpose to complain precipitously to
them of the insolence of this man, seeing they are the cause of it; and other
remedies are to be sought out. But Prince Mahamed said unto me, Is it possible
that the Sophi (who heretofore, as I have understood, has been so rigorous an
observer of the Laws of this Empire, that he banished the Satrap Arsalon, for
marrying a maid that was not noble) should so shamefully infringe them for him,
in authorizing the love of Deliment? This is a thing, my Lord, said I unto him,
whereof we must be cleared by the way which I have showed. This discourse being
finished, and our resolution taken, I perceived that we were a great way
distant from the Princesses, so that turning the Prince about, he observed that
I would reconduct him to a place, where he would not have the liberty to speak
unto me; wherefore standing still, and wringing me a little by the hand; go not
so fast, said he unto me, amiable Felixana, and be pleased, that as Axiamira
has to day judged you worthy of communicating all her secrets unto you, so I
may acquaint you with one of mine that concerns my life; to the end that our
interests being so well joined together, our party may be the more stronger,
and our enemy the weaker. And when I had answered him, that it was easy for
him to judge by my past actions of the desire I had to serve him; you may well
think, said he unto me, according to the discourse which my sister used to me,
that I should lack reason, in making protestations of love unto you, were I not
constrained thereunto by the force of truth and my passion. Protestations of
love to me, my Lord, said I? Yes, dear maid, replied he; and though I know very
well, how it is an hard thing to believe, and hard to persuade, that a blind
man, who cannot truly figure unto himself what Beauty is, should be desperately
in love with you; yet is it certain that none has ever been so much as I am, I
hear all those that come near you, talk to you of the attracts of your eyes, of
the beauty of your complexion, of your stature, and of your neck; but I hear
none tell you, that your soul is fair, that your spirit is great and generous,
that your goodness is extreme, and that in conclusion you are the most virtuous
person that is in the world; yet is it with these beauties that my soul is
touched; and they are they which doubtless render my love more strong and more
pure, then all those, which, as I have heard say, are destroyed by the loss of
that beauty that is unknown to me. But that which I have for you shall
certainly last as long as my life; for the beauty, discreet Felixana, which I
adore in you, cannot be destroyed by time. If you be rigorous to me, continued
he, I shall excuse your rigor by the knowledge I have of my defects; and if you
be not so to me, I will set no bounds to your hopes, no more then to my
affection. But in the mean time, said he unto me, do me the grace to let me
know, in what manner you will have me live with you. It is not for me, my Lord,
answered I, to rule your life; but it is for me to rule my mind so, as to
believe no more then I ought, and not to lose the respect, which I have always
rendered you. But, my Lord, added I, the first thing we are to think of is, to
draw Axiamira out of the pain wherein I see her. That is my intent, replied the
Prince, and I have desired to engage you the more straightly in it, by leting you
know, that Deliment cannot resolve to destroy me, without making you lose the
man, which in all the world loves you the most ardently, to the end that
understanding the interest you have therein, you may employ your self with the
more care. I received this discourse with moderation enough, and a great deal
of respect; as well because the virtue of this Prince pleased me, as because I
knew he loved, and very much esteemed Vlama and Axiamira; but in such sort
howsoever, as I engaged my self to nothing. In the mean time we came to the
Princesses, and with them we found Deliment, whom Ismael had sent for by the
persuasion of Perca. As soon as he saw me near to my fellows, he came to
quarrel with me for having walked so long with the Prince, and separating me
from him, without any incivility, because the Gentleman, that used to lead
Mahamed, had lent him his hand again, I quickly discerned by his discourse,
that there was a great intelligence between the Sophi and him: For as soon as
he saw me alone, he began to tell me, that I was the happiest person of my sex,
if I knew well how to manage the affection which the Sophi bore me; that he
gave me this advice as my servant; and that if I pleased, he would serve me in
it with all his power. I thanked him coldly enough for this offer, and told
him, how I knew very well, that all my happiness came from the Sophi, seeing
the beautiful Axiamira made up all my felicity; and saying so, I returned to my
fellows, which already were going after the Princes, and Princesses, who
retired with very different thoughts. For Axiamira had her mind filled with
choler and hate; Mahamed added to all those things the love he bore to me;
Perca thought to work so by her artifices, as we understood afterward, that a
man, who was of no great birth, should marry her sister, to the end she might
make use of it when time should serve: Deliment imagined how he might deceive
all the world for the satisfying of his love and his ambition; and Ismael alone
knew not very well what he was thinking on. As for me, I was so surprised with
the insolency of Deliment toward the Princess, of the artifice of Perca, of
the love of Mahamed, and of that of the Sophi, as I could scarcely speak. But
in fine, my Lord, that I may not amuse my self too long about petty things,
having such great ones to tell you, you shall understand that we learned a
little after, by the address of Vlama, by the intelligence which I got from
Perca's confident, and by the innocence and simplicity of Ismael, all the
several designs of these interessed persons. As for the Sophi, the greatest
interest that he had in this affair, was only in my person; for though he durst
not speak to me of his passion, for the reason I have alleged; yet was it so
strong, as he was constrained to discover it to Deliment, who promised him to
speak to me of it; and in case I should not be discreet enough to conceal this
secret from others, he would be so confident as to disavow all that he had said
to me. For Deliment, he had a long time before won an old Satrap, in whom the
Sophi very much confided for the affairs of the Empire, and who had oftentimes
persuaded him by Deliment's direction, that the Law, which had caused Arsalon
to be banished, was very judiciously made for his subjects, but not for him;
persuading him, that Kings, which did not marry their daughters to foreign
Princes, were never to admit the noblest and the greatest of their subjects
into their alliance; because that most commonly was to take Tutors, in taking
sons in law of an high birth; and that for the good of the Prince, of the
State, and of the Princesses, it would be better to do otherwise. For, said he
unto him one day, coming to particulars, if by example, the Princess Axiamira
had married Deliment, what a felicity would yours be, to have a son-in-law,
that should owe all his glory to you, and absolutely depend on you? and what an
happiness would it be for Axiamira to have an husband, without having a master?
it being certain, that the inequality of their conditions would always keep
Deliment in the terms of duty and obedience. With such like reasons as these it
was, that this wicked man had caused the mind of the Sophi to be prepared
before he would discover his love unto him. But whereas he had understood by
his Agent, that he had not reject^d those propositions, the morning that he had
been to see the Princess, which was the same wherein the Sophi discovered to
him the love which he bore to me, he wrought so dexterously with him, as he made
him comprehend, that if he had a passion in some sort unworthy of his rank, he
on the contrary had one, that was far above all he could pretend unto, and that
would not permit him to hope for any thing. He spoke this to him with so much
cunning, as he designed Axiamira unto him, yet without engaging himself so far,
but that he might interpret his discourse after another manner, if he perceived
the Sophi to be offended at it. But he had too much need of him for me, and his
mind was too much possessed with maxims of State, which were advantageous to
Deliment, for him to be so: and indeed far from being displeased with it, he
embraced, and told him, that his hopes might go so high, as that he permitted
him to lift up his eyes, even to the Princess Axiamira. For, said he unto him,
since Nature has not given me children, which can govern this Empire, I would
be willing that love and fortune would give me such a one as Deliment, who may,
if not be Sophi after me, at leastwise counsel him that shall be. Deliment,
cunning and dextrous as he was, made as though he did not believe that which
the Sophi said to him, and out of a f^^gned respect not seeming to acknowledge
that to be his passion, the Sophi said unto him, to oblige him thereunto, that
it being not so far from him to the Princess Axiamira, as from me to the Sophi
of Persia, he was not to fear that he would thence forward oppo^e an un^qual
affection, seeing he had discovered his unto him. But when as Deliment
continued saying, that respect was stronger in him then all other things, the
Sophi, that he might know whether it were Axiamira indeed whom he was in love
withal, carried him to her lodging; and it was then that this rash man was so
audacious, as to speak with such insolency to the Princess. For whereas he had
tried that love could not move her, he believed that ambition might; and that
the hope of reigning over Persia would move her more, then the certainty
wherein she was of reigning over his heart. As for the Princess Perca, they had
a long time before treated together, and he had persuaded her, that the Crown
of Persia was to be sh^red between her and her sister; and for that effect she
was to be kept from marrying any man, whose generosity (for so it was that he
spoke) should carry him to let stupid Ismael, or blind Mahamed reign. And when
he made a show of seeking out, who in the Court might be Axiamira's husband, he
played his part so well, that he led her, as cunning as she was, to the point
he desired. For after she had mused awhile, as well as he, what need have we,
said she unto him, to seek so far off for that, which we may find in the
person of Del^ment? He, seeming to have no other interest in this affair then
the good of the Princesses, held off a good while, that he might be the more
pressed unto it. But at length, being come to agreement about their conditions,
they judged, that albeit Ismael was not capable of rendering a party much
stronger then if he were not of it, yet it would be advantageous for them to
seize upon his spirit; and Perca took the care to do it. As indeed, she easily
persuaded him, that it was requisite Axiamira should be married to a man that
depended on him, and not on Mahamed, who after the death of the Sophi might
trouble him, in demanding a great portion, as if he were not blind; so that to
weaken his party, it would be good to marry Axiamira to Deliment, who would tie
himself wholly to his interests. Behold, my Lord, the motives and the causes of
Deliment's insolency to Axiamira; of the discourses which he made to me
touching the love of the Sophi; of the persuasions of Perca and Ismael; and of
the unquietness, which this unpleasing entanglement gave us. For being
advertised of part of these things, which we understood much better afterward,
Prince Mahamed, Axiamira, Vlama, and I, who was also of the counsel, resolved,
that the Princess should always treat Deliment with a great deal of coldness
and indifferency; without giving him for all that any notable cause of
complaining: That the best would be carefully to avoid all occasions wherein
the Sophi might speak of this man; it being more expedient, that the matter
should not break forth but upon extremity, because it might arrive that it
would not have a s^qu^l so grievous as we foresaw it: That in the mean time we
should labor to let Perca know, that Deliment did not intend to use her better,
then Ismael and Mahamed: That for me, I should receive the discourse, which he
should make me concerning the Sophi's love, as a thing I did not believe, and
that I would not have to be true; and that I should give him as little occasion
as I could to speak to me of it. I offered the Princess to retire to my father
under pretext of a supposed sickness, but if the good will which she bore me
opposed it, Prince Mahameds love hindered it absolutely: In regard whereof they
represented unto me, that if I should do so, it would be the undoing of all,
because if the Sophi did love me, he would be so incensed thereby, as he might
peradventure be carried to a violence, which otherwise he would not be capable
of. As for Vlama, he had secret apprehensions which incessantly tormented him;
the power of his Rival made him afraid, neither was he so assured of my
constancy, but that he feared ambition would move me more then his love. But
whereas it was not long before I perceived his unquietness, I wrote unto him,
for his better assurance, that nothing but death could keep me from performing
the promise, which I had made him to be wholly his, when he had settled his
affairs so, as he might marry me. For whereas he was a widow r by the death of
the Sophi's sister, civility would not permit him to think so soon of a second
marriage, esp^c^ally with a person, whose birth, though noble and illustrious
enough, came not near for all that to the former. Things being in these terms,
we were a good while without having any great occasion to increase our
unquietness; because the Sophi and Deliment having consulted a second time
together, and resolved to seek to gain me by gentl^ness, before they would come
to force, there was nothing but sports and entertainments. And whereas,
according to the order I had for it, so often as Deliment spoke to me of the
Sophi's love, I made as though I did not believe there was any truth in his
words; Tachmas being thereof advertised, and desiring to give me a proof of the
esteem he made of that they called beauty in may face, he did a thing, which
has since been the cause of a great deal of mischief; for, generous Ibrahim,
it happen^d for our ill fortune, that there arrived about that time at this
Court a Painter of Europe, whom chance, or the desire of traveling had brought
thither, and that drew pictures in little, so admirable resembling the life, as
the like had never been hear of. And at the same time certain Merchants came
thither also, who, amongst other rarities, which they had, made show of a
number of the pictures of the fairest women of such several Nations, as they
had passed through. These two things joined together, caused the Sophi, out of
the design he had to oblige me, to give command that all the maidens of
quality, which were at the Court, should present themselves at his Palace on a
certain day, appointed for it, together with the Princesses and their maids,
sumptuously apparelled. This ceremony, whereof we knew not the cause (for they
made a secret of it) somewhat troubled us, but at length that day being
arrived, and all this fair Assembly completed, the Sophi followed by Ismael,
Mahamed, Vlama, Deliment, and the Painter, of whom I have spoken to you, entered
into the room, where we were all set in order, but without the Princesses
holding the rank, which they ought to have had, for so had the Sophi ordained
it; and that which also redoubled the impatience we were in, to know for what
reason they had caused us to be attired so richly, was, to see the Sophi hold
in his right hand two Crowns of gold set with Diamonds, and taking the Painter
with his left hand, whom neither the Princess^s, nor any of their maidens knew
as yet, to say unto him, that he established him the judge of the beauty of all
those which composed this fair Assembly; as knowing better, then the rest of
the world, the just proportion of the features of the face; that which made up
the delicacy, freshness, and vivacity of the complexion; and what the
difference was between an animated beauty, and another that has no life nor
grace in it. And that to make him give a more equitable sentence, he had so
ordered it, as he could not discern the condition of the fair ones, of whom he
was the judge; but howsoever that he nevertheless reserved to himself the right
of crowning them, whom he should judge to be worthy of that honor. This said, he
led him all over the room, and making an exact stand at each of them, that so
none might be disobliged, he finished his first turn, none being able to judge
that he had given advantage to any; nevertheless I perceived, when the Pain^er
made a stand before me, that the Sophi, seeing me cast down my eyes, as
pretending to no part in this victory, had said softly, that I had not so much
as need of their sparkling, to merit the Crown, having beauty enough
other-where. It is certain that I blushed at this discourse, and that lifting up
my eyes again, I encountered Vlama's, wherein I marked so much unquietness, as
it pityed me exceedingly. Prince Mahamed was close by him, who not able to see
but with others eyes, demanded softly of him, what they were doing: But at
last, when the Painter, for ceremonies sake, had separated twelve from the
rest, whereof the Princess Axiamira and I were two; and that the Sophi had
willed him once again to be equal; whether it were that Tachmas had made me
known to the Painter, without my perceiving it, as in all likelihood he had; or
whether he was not very knowing in beauty, I was the first that was declared
victorious, and on whose head the Sophi set one of the Crowns. But whereas I
knew very well, that this victory was an effect rather of the Soph^'s love,
then of my beauty, it brought me more spite then joy; so that taking the
Crown, which had been given me, I went to place it at the feet of Axiamira,
just as the Sophi, by the sentence of the Painter, set the other on her head.
But he, seeing this action of mine, took that which I was going to place on the
ground, and giving it me again a second time; Is it, said he unto me, for that
the Crown which I offer you is not beautiful enough? or that the hand which
presents it to you is not illustrious enough? It is neither the one nor the
other, my Lord, answered I, but it is because I am neither beautiful, nor
illustrious enough, to wear a Crown, that parts from the hand of so great a
Prince. And then coming nearer to me, Receive this same, said he to me softly,
fair maid, and believe, if you will be reasonable, that this shall not be the
last you shall receive from me. All the answer I made to this discourse was
only blushing, and so I shuffled in my self amongst my fellows, with as much
displeasure for my victory, as they had vexation for that they had not carried
it. But in conclusion, my Lord, Axiamira and I were painted in the habit of
Amazons, which, as he said who drew our pictures, was pleasing to all Nations:
When they were done, the Sophi caused him to make six copies of each of us,
which he put into Cases of Gold, enriched with Diamonds, and gave them to those
Merchants, who had showed him so many foreign beauties; but with an oath, that
they should never sell them to any but Princes, and that they should always
reserve one of each of them in their own keeping, to publish Axiamira's beauty
and mine over all the Countries through which they traveled. These Merchants
promised all that he required, and for our ill fortune kept their word but too
well, as you shall understand hereafter. From that same day Deliment persecuted
me more then ordinary, it seeming unto him that I was no longer to doubt of the
Sophi's love, after that which he had said unto me. And whereas I desired to
decline his encounter, as much as I could, I stood oftentimes talking with
Prince Mahamed; because though he contemned him, yet his quality made him that
he durst not separate me from him, when we were in discourse together. And I
remember that one day, as this poor Prince was entertaining me, and that
Deliment was come to the Princesses with Ismael, out of a design to say
something to me from the Sophi, this insolent man did so far lose the respect
which he owed to Mahamed, as I hated him for it more then I did before. I have
already told you blushing, generous Ibrahim, that this Prince was in love with
me; and though I had nothing but good will for him, and that Vlama absolutely
possessed my heart, yet did I in some sort comply with Mahamed, for his
discourse was so virtuous, and so obliging, though passionate, as if Vlama had
heard it, I verily think he could not have hated this illustrious Rival. I was
also willing to conserve the good will of the son, out of the intent I had to
refuse the love of the father. It was then with his passion that Mahamed
entertained me that day, when as Deliment had so great a desire to speak with
me, and that finding himself hindered from it by the Princes presence, he
thought good to observe both ^is actions and mine. And whereas it is hard for
the motions of the face not to give some marks of those of the heart,
especially when love possesses it; Deliment perceived something which was
extraordinary in that of the Prince; for Mahamed, albeit he was blind, yet
came up close to me, as if he could have seen me; and because his eyes could
not advertise him when there was any one near us that could hear him, and that
it would have but put me in remembrance of his defect if he should have said
any thing to me of it, he always used to speak softly unto me; which that day,
amongst others, gave no little unquietness to Deliment; for having marked that
I had blushed twice or thrice, and it seeming to him to be without anger, he
suspected somewhat of the truth. And whereas he was insolent, and accustomed to
a bitter jeering, which made him to be yet more hated of every one, he said,
speaking of me, to Perca's Confident, who was hard by him (for those two
Princesses were retired into Axiamira's Cabinet, accompanied by Ismael,) does
not this so long and so particular a conversation possess you with curiosity?
for as for me, continued he, I profess unto you that I cannot comprehend it. If
it be of indifferent ^^^^gs, I am certain, that he cannot talk to her of the
rarities which he has seen in his voyages; if it be of War, he cannot render
her any other account but of the noise of the Canons; and if it be of Love, I
am well assured that he does not entertain her, either with the whiteness of
her skin, or the sweetness of her look; so that I conclude he cannot talk to
her but of his dreams, which should not be very pleasing, since the objects he
has seen conduce not much to the furnishing him with fair idea's. Deliment
spoke so softly, as I could not hear him; but whereas the privation of sight
seemed to have redoubled in Mahamed the delicacy of hearing, he lost not one
word of that which I have delivered. I perceived very well, that upon a sudden
he had held his peace, that he had blushed, and that without harkening to me he
had lent an ear to Deliment; but I was much surprised, when as turning him
toward the place where he heard him speak, he said unto him with a strong and
confident voice: Thou think it may be, insolent as thou art, that because I
am blind, I should be deaf also; howbeit know, that I have but too well heard,
for thy interest, the injurious words which thou have spoken; for though I am
deprived of sight, I have not lost my courage; and did not the respect of
Axiamira retain me, I would strangle thee with mine own hands, or thy flight
should shelter thee from my fury; but what say I, continued he, thou know
well, base man, that I could not follow thee, and that is it which makes thee
so audacious. Deliment during this discourse did nothing but smile, which so
incensed me, as I could not forbear beholding him with rage; but meaning to
carry insolency to the highest point, he told Mahamed, that he had said nothing
of him, which he might not say again to the Sophi, without offending him. I do
not think, replied Mahamed, that he would be as unjust to authorize thy
insolency to me, as to Axiamira; but howsoever, get thee out of this lodging,
and never come into the place where I am, I charge thee. I assure you, answered
Deliment as he was going away, that you shall never see me more. This last jeer
so mightily incensed Mahamed, as he would have gone to that part where he heard
the voice of Deliment; but knowing that his misfortune would not permit his
coming at him to punish his audaciousness, I retained him the best I could; and
not thinking of Perca's Confident being there, Let this senseless fellow go, my
Lord, said I unto him, and consider that your hand is too noble to punish his
arrogance; and that in stead of doing him an affront, you will do him an honor,
whereof he is not worthy. At this noise the Princesses opened the Cabinet, and
Axiamira asking what the matter was, saw Prince Mahamed exceedingly moved; It
is, answered he, an insolency of Deliments, which I may not tell you so
suddenly; for, my dear sister, those of his party are yet too strong here.
Perca seeming not to understand that this discourse was addressed to her, I
assure my self, said this subtle Princess, that this was one of Deliment's
merriments, which the Prince has misunderstood; but lest this disorder,
continued she, should oblige the Sophi to forbid the Princes from bringing any
body to our lodging, I will go and endevor to appease this tempest. Spare that
pain, replied Mahamed; for certainly, on my part, it shall never be appeased
but with the death of Deliment. But Perca, without answering this discourse,
took Ismael by the land, and all amazed as he was, carried him away whither she
pleased. We were no sooner ^t liberty to talk, but Mahamed recounted to the
Princess Axiamira all Deliment's insolency, and that with so much choler, and
marks of resentment, as made me much to pity this poor Prince. Will you endure,
dear sister, said he unto her, that the Enemy of Mahamed shall become the
husband of Axiamira? That a man, which has made use of your chamber, as of a
sanctuary, to affront me with impunity, shall be yet so audacious as to pretend
to the possession of your person? Ah! no, you are too generous to have such
base thoughts: and I hope, though my eyes are not able to guide my hand so as
it may give this Insolent an ^undred stabs, yet that yours will at the least
take all the revenge of him you can, in showing him so many marks of your rigor
and disdain, as the love and ambition, which reign in his heart, wanting
satisfaction, he may howsoever have two domestical Enemies, which will
persecute him incessantly, or to say better, until such time as I have found
out a man generous enough to guide my arm, or to lend me his Vlama entered into
the chamber just at that instant, and having heard those last words, wi^^out
giving the Princess leisure to answer, he went to Mahamed, and assured him,
that except it were against the person of the Sophi, he might dispose of him in
any thing, and ^^ploy him in such revenge as he pleased. Mahamed having quickly
known Vla^^ (...) ^^ce: Ah! generous Vlama, said he unto him, that I am not in
a condition to ackn^^^^^^ ^^y virtue, rather then to have need of thy courage
against an infamous fellow, who cannot pretend to any other part of valor, but
that which those cruel beasts may have, who are not valiant, but because they
are strong, and of a bloody disposition. The Princess, who perceived that in
stead of being appeased, Mahamed grew the more incensed with talking, made him
enter into her Cabinet with Vlama, and me; where we no sooner were, but she
beginning to speak, assured Mahamed, that she was no less sensible of
Deliment's insolency then he; that she promised never to marry him, not, said
she, because I would have you obliged to me for it, or that you should think I
do it for the love of you, but contrarily, I desire you would believe, that
when Deliment showed the most love and respect to me, I would still have made
choice of death, rather then be his wife; for in fine, his birth, his humor,
his wickedness, and his arrogance, have possessed me with so much hatred
against him, as there is no extremity, whereunto I will not be carried, rather
then consent to any thing that may please him. But that which I desire you
should think, is, that if the greatest Prince of the Earth, and that did most
touch mine inclination, should offer you any outrage, I would be his cruellest
Enemy, and the first that would be revenged on him for it. Ah! generous sister
(said Mahamed, interrupting her, and much comforted with hearing her speak so)
I was persuaded, that my quarrel should be yours, and that you would not
abandon me. When as I saw that their discourse resolved on nothing, I told
them, that without amusing themselves about giving testimonies of their
affection one to another, which was to no purpose, since it could not be
doubted of, it would be better for them to employ the time in considering,
whether Mahamed should complain to the Sophi, or whether he should stay, to see
in what manner Deliment would live with him for the future, after he had
forbidden him his pre^ence. This advice seeming just unto them, they began to
examine the matter. As for Mahamed, he would neither complain, nor stay, but
only revenge himself. Vlama, who foresaw that no good could come of this
revenge, either for the Prince, or for the Princess, or for himself, stayed
till Axiamira had delivered her opinion, pretending that he was not to speak
his, in regard, said he, that it belonged only to him to execute that which
the Princess and Mahamed should resolve upon. So that Axiamira being unwilling
to speak alone by her self, commanded me to say what I thought was fit to be
done in this affair. I confess to you, generous Ibrahim, that notwithstanding
the hate which I bare to Deliment, I advised, that things should be gently
carried; and that if he came to submit himself to Mahamed, he should be
received, and show made of pardoning him; but upon condition nevertheless, that
he should appear as seldom as he might in places where Mahamed should be. And
that which carried me hereunto, was the thought, that if Vlama enterprized any
thing against Deliment, the least that could arrive unto me by it would be,
that Vlama would be constrained to absent himself, and leave me in the power of
the Sophi. As for the Princess, she was of the opinion, that a gentleman should
be sent from Mahamed to complain to the Sophi of Deliments insolency; and that
withal great care should be taken to publish it, because, said she to Mahamed,
it will be requisite to make him be contemned and hated of every one, as much
as possibly we can, that we make use of that hatred and contempt when time
shall serve; for, continued she, the world is not acquainted with his temerity
and audaciousness; and whereas he is rich and liberal, he has partisans and
servants, who durst not declare themselves to be so, if they knew that you and
I did hate him. Why, sister, replied Mahamed, would you have me publish, that I
have received an affront with impunity? Yes, said she, I would have it
published, that you may be revenged of Deliment, seeing you may do it without
offense to your reputation. Consider, added she, that if the generosity of
Vlama should carry him to fight with Deliment, your revenge would be doubtful,
since you cannot be ignorant, that the success of Arms is always so, and if
peradventure it should cost you the blood and fortune of so excellent a man,
you would repent you of this violence. No, Madam, said Vlama interrupting her,
never stand on these considerations; seeing my fortune, my blood, and my life,
could not be employed more gloriously, then in revenging Prince Mahamed. But,
replied she, the matter is not so easy as you imagine; your design may be
discovered; the opportunity of executing it perchance will not be presented;
and then to speak freely unto you, I cannot approve of that violence in
Mahamed, which I should condemn in others. It will be better then to lay the
blame on the Sophi and Deliment in a gentle way; and procure him secret
Enemies, who when occasion shall require, and that we would openly oppose his
violences, may serve us with courage, and give us the means to be revenged,
without fear, and with honor. In brief, this sage Princess maintained her
opinion with so many reasons, as it was followed: And to execute it, I went to
give order for the fetching of an old Governor, who had brought up Mahamed, and
that was one of the wisest and understandingest men of our age, to the end he
might go to the Sophi, who whilst we were taking our resolution entertained
Deliment. For as soon as he was gone out of Axiamira's chamber he went unto
that of the Sophi, to whom for the coloring of his insolency he said, that
finding me every day more rebellious to his will, he could think no other, but
that my heart was engaged other-where; and that having observed all my actions,
he had found that Prince Mahamed did not hate me; that to be the better cleared
thereof, and carried by the zeal which he had to his service, he had spoken
some jesting words, whilst the Prince entertained me, which he had taken so
ill, as his anger thereupon did persuade him the more to that opinion of his.
It is not, said he smiling, (as we understood afterward) because it may be
easily imagined, that the beauty of Felixana has given you a rival; but
howsoever I would not conceal my suspicion from you, and it is for you to make
my peace with Prince Mahamed, if you will not have the beautiful Axiamira hate
me. I will take the care of that upon me, replied the Sophi; and believe that I
am not a little obliged unto you, in that you have not feared to anger Mahamed,
for to serve me in a thing, whereon my felicity depends. Judge, my Lord, whether
after this artifice, the complaints of this poor Prince were well received or
no. The Sophi nevertheless desired to keep some decorum, being unable to
believe that Mahamed was amorous, though he resolved to clear himself further
therein. As soon then as that ancient Governor of Mahamed had made his
complaint, he told him, that he was already advertised of the matter; and that
to give satisfaction to Mahamed, he commanded him to pardon Deliment, whose
heart he well knew, and was sure that he had no purpose to offend him, and that
it had been nothing but a light temptation, to say some merriment. And when
that Governor would have besought him, that at leastwise Deliment should not
come, but as seldom as he could, to the places where Prince Mahamed should be;
the Sophi bid him make no further reply, for he would be obeyed; and for that
effect he would go and carry Deliment to Axiamira's chamber, to the end that in
the same place, where the fault had been committed, it might also be pardoned;
so that when we expected the Sophi's answer, we saw him himself enter, leaning
on Deliment, and followed by Ismael and Perca, who not having seen Deliment
since her going forth, because he was with the Sophi, she had followed them to
this ch^mber, as soon as she had been advertised that they came thither. I
leave you to judge, whether this visit did not possess Mahamed with choler, and
Axiamira and me with amazement. But we were yet in much more, when as the Sophi
fell to amplify the obligations which he had to Deliment, his virtues, his
merit, the affection he bare to the Princes and Princesses; and in fine,
continued he, the greatest mark that can be given me of the passion one is in
for my service, is, to render the same honors to Deliment, as if he were my
son; and as for you, said he, leaning on Mahamed's shoulder, I command you to
love Deliment, and to live well with him. It would be methinks more just,
replied the Prince, that you would ordain him not to affront me, since he
cannot do so without offending you. I do excuse, answered the Sophi, the ill
opinion you have of Deliment, seeing it is not occasioned but by the little
knowledge you have of his intentions. But howsoever I will be obeyed; and
without examining whether my pleasure be unjust or equitable, I command you to
receive his submissions and his friendship. Hereupon Deliment began to speak,
and disguising the malice of his soul, he said so many obliging things to
Mahamed, as if he had not perfectly known his wickedness, he might have
believed that he was capable of repenting. So it was, that Mahamed was
constrained to make show of no longer resenting the offense he had received.
This peace brought great joy to Perca; but Axiamira's coldness made it apparent
enough that they were not both of one party. The Sophi continued yet some time
in talking of indifferent things, during the which he still fixed his eyes on
my face: And whereas out of a sense of compassion, and to avoid his looks, I
turned my head all that while toward Mahamed, he began to think that there
might be some verity in Deliments suspicion. He was no sooner returned to his
lodging, but thinking of the means to be cleared therein, he conceived that the
gentleman, who served to guide Mahamed, might peradventure be he from whom he
might learn something. He had no sooner communicated this design to Deliment,
but that having approved of it, he thought of nothing else then executing it.
And to that purpose he waited, that he might give no suspicion to Mahamed, till
he was retired in the Evening, for at that time the Prince not using to stir
forth any more, always left his guide at liberty; Deliment, who had caused him
to be watched, was no sooner advertised that he was come out of the Princes
chamber, but he made him be secretly told, that the Sophi would speak with him.
This man, who had not been accustomed to receive such like favors, p^esently
obeyed; and the Sophi, joining the hope of a great fortune, presents, and
entreaties, to his commands, had quickly suborned his fidelity. After then that
he was well assured of him, both by reason of the things I have spoken of, and
of the fear of punishment if he f^iled in his promise, he commanded him exactly
to observe all Prince Mahamed's actions, to take good notice of what he spoke
of me; to endevor to learn something thereof; and to give him an account of it
every Evening at the same hour. And when he pressed him to tell him, whether he
had not perceived that there was some intelligence between the Prince and me,
he answered him, that he knew no more thereof, but that the Prince spoke
oftener of me, then of any other of my fellows. But whilst they were betraying
him in this sort, he was not without unquietness; The spite to be so ill
entreated by the Sophi, and so unworthily affronted by Deliment, without having
an assured mean to be revenged of it, put him into no little pain: And then
again, when he came to think, that the next day he should encounter with
Deliment again at Axiamira's lodging, his great heart could not so soon resolve
upon so grievous a thing; he purposed then, for the declining of it, to make a
show of being sick, and not to stir out of his chamber a good while. But when
he came to consider, that in declining the encounter of Deliment, he should
deprive himself of mine, love was stronger in him then spite; and the
conversation of his Enemy was not so redoubtable, as the hope of mine was sweet
unto him. Howbeit imagining, that the Princess would visit him during his
feigned sickness, and that I, being her Confident, would not fail to accompany
her thither, spite reassumed its former place, and made him execute his
resolution. The next day he feigned himself sick, and would let no body see
him; but fearing lest Axiamira should be troubled at it, he sent her word, that
she should not be disquieted for it, assuring her, that the greatest remedy he
had need of was her conversation, or to be alone. The Princess understood well
enough what the Prince desired of her, so that as soon as she had met with
occasion fit for it, she went to see Mahamed, carrying none with her but an old
Governess, one of my fellows, and me. But Perca, having understood that
Axiamira was gone to see Prince Mahamed, who was not well, persuaded Ismael and
Deliment to go thither too; so that we were hardly arrived at Mahamed's
chamber, but we were advertised, that this Enemy troop was coming to trouble
our rest. The Prince was so enraged at it, as Axiamira, fearing he should be
carried to some violence, made haste to be gone, so that meeting them in the
antichamber, where she stayed them, she told them that the Prince being
asleep, she would not suffer him to be awaked, and thereby obliged them to
return. In the mean time Mahamed, who could not forbear giving me to
understand, that he lived still for me, called to him his guide, named Amariel,
who oftentimes served him also for a Secretary. He recommends secrecy and
discretion to him, and after he had made him swear an hundred false oaths, he
dictates a letter unto him for me, which he wrote very faithfully; And having
caused him to read it over more then once unto him, he gives him order to go
the next morning for to know how the Princess does, and then to deliver me that
letter as secretly as he could. Amariel promises to acquit himself thereof as
he ought; and very glad of his adventure, he retires from the Prince, and goes
with all speed to do an act of fidelity to the Sophi, and of treachery to
Mahamed. The Sophi caresses him extraordinarily, and taking the letter with
very much impatience, he sees that it was extremely passionate, and that
Deliment's suspicions were not ill grounded. He sent immediately for him,
showed him the letter which he had, and exceedingly moved with choler,
demanded what counsel he should take? Deliment, as more cunning, and less
preoccupated, told him, how by this letter well considered one migh easily see,
that Mahamed was passionately in love with me, but that one could not judge,
whether I answered his passion or no; so that to be cleared therein, Amariel
was to deliver this letter to me, and crave an answer of it. That for his part,
he believed that I did not hate him, because one of Perca's maids had heard me
say somewhat, as she went out of Axiamira's chamber, that made him think so.
This resolution being taken, Amariel according to his directions came unto me,
rendered me Mahameds letter, and gave me the commodity to answer it. For whereas
he was come very early, the Princess was not yet awake, and I was still in my
chamber, without any other company then a maid that waited on me. Until then, I
had believed, that I was not obliged to let Vlama know any thing of Prince
Mahamed's love; but when I foresaw that it was like to have some sequel, I
resolved, when I could find a favorable occasion, to say something to him of
it; and in the mean time so to live with Mahamed, as he should have no cause to
be offended with me, nor yet hope to engage me to the affection which he
desired of me. I answered him with a great deal of respect, and turning the
sense of his words as dexterously as I could, I answered to a letter of love, as
if it had been a letter of friendship. Amariel had no sooner gotten mine
answer, but he went away very well satisfied to the Sophi, who was not sorry to
see, that I had not so much affection for Mahamed, but that he might hope to be
able to break it. He consulted then with his ordinary counsel, that is to say
with Deliment, and they resolved together, that from thence forward they would
change the Letters which the Prince should cause to be written to me, because
for so much as they could judge by that which they had seen, they would be too
well endited, and too passionate; purposing also, if it fell out that I should
answer him too obligingly, not to let it be read so to Prince Mahamed: who, as
if fortune would be assistant to our Enemies, became so sick indeed, as he was
fain to keep his chamber fifteen days together; In which time, there past not a
day, wherein he did not write unto me, and I did not answer him, without ever
knowing for all that what we said one to another; because the Sophi retained
all Mahamed's Letters, and caused others to be written to me; and likewise kept
all my answers, in making me speak as he pleased. I confess, that many times I
marvelled at the questions, wherewith those Letters, which I believed were
Mahamed's, were filled: and confronting the first I received from him with the
rest, I found so great a difference between them, were it for the gracefulness
of the style, o^ for the things he said to me, as I knew not what to think of
it. Nevertheless, seeing it was always the same hand, and receiving them the
same way, all I could conclude upon it was, That the blindness of this poor
Prince possessed him with such thoughts for love, as never any body had the
like but he. For whereas the Sophi's and Deliment's design was, to render
Mahamed contemptible to me, they made him write strange things by Amariel.
Sometimes they made this blind Prince say, that he was grieved he did not see
me; that the beauty of my eyes was always present before him; in another
Letter, that for the more conformity he would willingly that I had been blind
as he was, and the rather for that then I should not see the Sophi, whom he
knew to be his Rival. In another, he conjured me to let him have my picture,
and to send him word whether I were fair or brown. I leave you to think, since
I could not despise Mahamed, because I esteemed him very much other-ways,
whether these Letters did not move me to compassion; and though Deliment's
cunning did always intermix something of the Sophi among, yet I had always so
much discretion, or good hap, as not to make any answer to that particular. But
if Deliment drew up such senseless Letters for Mahamed, those which he made for
me, as I understood afterward, were not much more reasonable. And the Prince
has told me, that when Amariel read them to him, he could not choose but make
him read them over again and again. It was not because Deliment, who ordinarily
dictated them, had made them very obliging, but because the Prince, finding
them so badly penned, was persuaded that it was Amariel's fault, who read them
ill; for he could not imagine, that a person, whose wit seemed worthy of his
esteem, should express her thoughts with so bad a grace; and to that effect, he
made him read them over many times, that he might be able to discern the faults
of the Reader, from those which they made to pass for mine.

But whilst the malice of Deliment triumphed over the Sophi's facility, and
our innocence, Mahamed being well amended, caused himself to be led to the
Princesses lodging, to render her his first visit, or to say better, to have a
pretext to give me one. For he has told me since, how he was not without
impatience to hear me talk, to the end he might know, whether I had still the
same wit, which he had so much prized in me. He did not marvel, that I had
always answered him with rigor enough, because he might well think that mine
own virtue, and the fear of committing my self to the discretion of him that
was to read my Letters, would carry me thereunto; but to say things from the
purpose to him, was that which he could not comprehend. As long as his sickness
had lasted, the Princess Axiamira had been often enough to visit him, but Perca
had most commonly been in her company, so that we spoke not together, until
that coming, as I have said, one morning to visit Axiamira, with a purpose, if
he found her alone, to declare to her the passion which he was in for me; not
finding her yet awake, and making as though he would attend till she was, he
caused himself to be led to my chamber; when he came thither, I had almost done
reading a Letter from Vlama, who, provoked by the force of his passion, and the
fear he was in lest the Sophi's love should prevail with me more then his,
conjured me to remember the promises which I had made him; never to love any
but him; and consequently, passed over again all the testimonies of affection
which I had rendered him, that so he might oblige me not to deprive him of it.

At first, when Mahamed entered into my chamber, I thought to have hid the
Letter which I held, but suddenly calling to mind that he was blind, I
laughed at my providence, and so much the more, for that he had commanded
Amariel to stay in a gallery, through which one was to pass for to come into my
chamber. When I saw my self alone with Mahamed, except it were a maid that
served me, and in whom I confided in all things, I was taken with such
impatience to make an end of reading Vlama's Letter, as presently after the
first civilities, I began to unfold it as softly as possibly I could, and
without answering precisely to Mahamed's discourses I read that which Vlama
writ unto me. Mahamed, who certainly has a great deal of understanding, and
that according to the custom of the blind is always a little suspicious,
though out of discretion he makes as little show of it as may be, hearing the
noise which the Letter made in turning it from the one side to the other, (for
it was indifferent long) imagined that there was some mystery in it which he
did not comprehend; that peradventure the Sophi had during his sickness
absolutely gained me, and that the paper, which I held, and whereof he heard
the noise, was a Letter from him, or from Deliment; In so grievous a thought,
this so wise and so moderate a Prince could not resist the temptation of
clearing himself of a doubt, which gave him so much unquietness; so that at
such time as I never dreamed of it, and that I was folding up Vlama's Letter
again, and deeply musing on that which I had read, Mahamed directing his hand
by the noise which I made in doing it up, chance led it so just where it should
be, that he snatched it from me sooner then I was able to withstand him. I must
needs know, said he, amiable Felixana, whether this blessed Paper, which has
kept you from answering me, merits the honor you do it to my prejudice. My
Lord, said I unto him exceedingly troubled, if you could see what is in this
Letter, I would not resist your pleasure; but since you cannot know what it is
but by a third person, permit that I may conjure you to render it me. This
extreme earnestness that I showed to draw that Paper out of his hands was that
which provoked his curiosity the more; and though he did infinitely fear to
displease me, yet did he fear much more to be overreached. And then again,
believing Amariel to be very faithful, he thought he should hazard nothing, in
resolving to let him read it. In this opinion the more I importuned him, the
more did he defend himself from according that which I required; and I verily
believe that in so great a trouble I should have told him the truth of the
matter, and confided in his generosity, if Deliment, who had been advertised
that Prince Mahamed was in my chamber, had not come thither with Ismael, of
whom he made use upon all occasions, to trouble our conversation. For he feared
that so particular an interview would discover the trick they had played us; and
that thinking to destroy our friendship, they should settle it better then
before. But that which they feared was far from arriving, for Mahamed and I had
other manner of thoughts then to entertain our selves with Letters, which we
had received from one another. When first I saw Ismael and Deliment, I
testified a great deal of unquietness; and addressing my self to Mahamed with
an anger, which I had not much ado to counterfeit: You perceive my Lord, said I
unto him, that bad examples are soon followed; and that the liberty which you
have taken to enter into my chamber, has drawn in a company, which I ought not
to have admitted without the commandment of the Princess. The Princess, replied
Deliment, does she dispose of all your actions? Yes, said I unto him, and so
absolutely, as I am incapable of ever disobeying her. So that, continued he, if
one were in love with you, must he address himself to the Princess? That he
must without doubt, answered I him roundly; for I believe her to be so just, as
she will never force me in things, whereupon depend all the felicity, or all
the infelicity of my life. We had, it may be, continued in further talk, had
not one come and advertised them, that Axiamira was awake, and that they might
see her. They left me then to go to her; howbeit Prince Mahamed stayed not long
in the Princesses chamber; and that he might part from thence with civility, he
made as though he found himself not well upon going forth so soon after his
sickness, and retired to his lodging as speedily as he could.

When he came there, he commanded Amariel to clear the room, and after he had
assured him that they were alone, he gave him the Letter which he had taken
from me, and willed him to read it. But he was strangely amazed, when as he
knew by the reading of this Letter, that I had been a long time engaged in
affection to some one. For, as I have told you, Vlama had run over welneer all
that had ever passed betwixt us. He very well perceived by the style of this
Letter, that it was from a man of quality, and who feared lest the Sophi's love
should make me change; but whereas it had no name, and that the Princes
blindness did not Permit him to know Vlama's hand, he could not divine who it
should be, and in this uncertainty he endured such pain as cannot be expressed;
and said things which afterward moved me to pity when he recounted them unto
me; it being most certain, that the privation of his sight was never so
sensible to him as in this occasion.

In the mean time Amariel, who was cunning and dextrous, judging that it much
imported the Sophi to see this Letter, and fearing the Prince would keep this
paper, he folded up one, that was by chance on the Table, in the same form that
the other was, to the end he might change it. And truly this forecast of his
was not in vain, for indeed Mahamed, after he had caused this fatal Letter to
be read over again, re-demanded it of him, and getting to bed with that same
paper, which Amariel had foysted in, by reason of a weakness wherewith he was
taken by the excessive agitation of his spirits, he gave that Traitor the
liberty to go forth. He presently made use of the opportunity; and causing the
Sophi to be advertised that he had something to say to him, he had audience
instantly. He acquainted Tachmas with Mahamed's visit at my lodging; his
unquietness at his return; and at last showed him Vlama's Letter, which he knew
as soon as he had opened it; for he had seen many of his writing, at such time
as he was in War with the Azemites, and rendered him an account of his
victories. He sent immediately then for Deliment, that was newly come from the
Princess Axiamira, whom he had found yet more rebellious then she used to be.
As soon as he appeared, I will no longer seek, said he unto him, for that which
is the cause of Felixana's rigor, and that which makes her despise my presents,
my love, and even the hope of my Crown; for it was true, that Deliment
entertained me daily with such like matters. I think, my Lord, answered
Deliment, how that which renders Felixana inflexible is, That the knowledge of
your greatness permits her not to believe, that you will forget it for her
advantage; and the refusals which she makes, are nothing doubtless but that she
may be the more strongly assured of that which she desires it may be more then
you. No such matter, replied the Sophi, and this which I have here will
certainly make you change your opinion; in saying so, he showed him Vlama's
Letter, whereby they knew but too well the good will that was betwixt us, and
how much he was informed of that which the Sophi bore me. At first, a^l Tachmas
thoughts ran into violence; he would commit me to prison; he would destroy
Vlama; and his gentlest resolutions were at least to banish him.

But Deliment, who always joined cunning to wickedness, told him, that the
first thing he should do, was, to banish Felixana from the heart of Vlama, and
Vlama from the heart of Felixana; that to begin by the easiest, Vlama was to be
dexterously acquainted, that I had a particular commerce with Mahamed; and that
to persuade him the better thereunto, he was to be showed some of the letters
which I had written to the Prince, and which they had retained; leting him
know, in giving them to him, that they were the first he had received from me;
that to disquiet him further, his own Letter was to be showed him, with an
assurance that I had put it into his hands, for to give him an undoubted mark
of my affection; and that at the very same time, wh n as this trick had excited
trouble in his soul, he was to be commanded to get instantly out of the Palace,
and the next day from the Court, with order to retire to the Province, whereof
he was Governor; to the end he might not have leisure to clear himself to me;
and that believing he was betrayed, he might have the less care to let me hear
from him. That things being in these terms, it would be the easier to vanquish
me because not knowing the occasion which Vlama had to be incensed against me,
I would take it ill that he did neither write to me, nor see me before his
departure. That the most important point of this affair was, to be so well
assured of all those which came near me, as I might receive no Letters from
Vlama; and that in fine, the absence of a Lover was a great advantage for a
Rival.

The Sophi found this advice to be very good, and thinking on nothing but how
to execute it, they turned their eyes upon one of Mahamed's Officers, that had
before times served Vlama, who had rid himself of him by reason of his bad
inclinations. They caused him to be sought out, and having immediately found
and suborned him, he without further delay (after he had been instructed by
Deliment what to say, and had Vlama's Letter, and three of those which I had
written to Mahamed, put into his hands) went directly to Vlama, whom I could
not yet advertise of that which had past betwixt the Prince and me, because the
Sophi's love disquieted him so much, as he could not resolve to see me, for
fear of giving too much notice of his thoughts; and therefore to keep him from
it, he made as though he were exceedingly busied about the affairs of
Caramania, where the Sophi intended to make some Levies: Yet heard I for all
that from him every day by that faithful Slave, which he sent to you, and you
have brought to me.

This Agent of the Sophi's found him then in such an estate as they desired for
the surprising of him; he came to him, and finding him alone, makes him a long
discourse of the inclination which he had always had to his service; protesting
unto him that he would never relinquish it; that he acknowledged him still for
his Master, and that to render him a proof of his affection, he came, without
considering Prince Mahamed's interests, to advertise him of a Treason which I
committed against him. Vlama upon this occasion had a secret suspicion of this
man's malice; and imagined that he was sent unto him to discover whether there
were any intelligence betwixt us; so that nothing moved with this discourse, I
thank thee, said he unto him, for thy zeal and affection; but know, my friend,
that Felixana may well disoblige me, but cannot betray me, having had no
commerce with her, nor having ever trusted any thing to her discretion. I
perceive very well, my Lord, answered this man, that you do not trust in mine;
but it may be this Letter, which I present you with, will better persuade my
fidelity unto you. In saying so, he gave him that which he had written to me.
You may judge now whether Vlama were astonished when he came to know it; Howbeit
this first motion being over, he imagined further, that I peradventure might
have lost it, and some one have found it. But the cunning of this man left him
not long in this opinion; for seeing Vlama moved, and capable of being
persuaded, he told him, That Prince Mahamed had loved me a great while, and
that I also loved him; That so long as he believed, that there could no other
harm arrive to him, then to be deceived by me, he durst not betray Mahamed; but
having seen by the Letter, which he had written to me, and which, he said, I
had put into the Princes hands, that he spoke in such sort, as if it came to
the Sophi's knowledge, his fortune would be utterly ruined; he was resolved to
make use of the Princes blindness to draw it with address from out of his
hands; and, my Lord, continued he, to show you that I speak truth, I have taken
also three of the Letters which Felixana has written to the Prince in the
beginning of their affection; for as for the rest, I durst not meddle with
them, because as they are more obliging, so the Prince makes them to be read
unto him almost daily by Amariel, who is the Confident of this love.

Vlama harkened to this discourse, looked on her Letters and his, knew the
hands, and no longer doubting of my infidelity, he thanked this wicked man, and
asked him an hundred questions about the love that was between the Prince and
me. But the other fearing that he would demand so many things of him, as in the
end he might contradict himself in some one or other, he besought him he would
be pleased to let him depart, for fear lest if any of Prince Mahamed's Officers
should see him go out of his lodging so long after he was entered in^o it, they
might suspect the truth. Vlama deceived by this artifice, dismissed him,
promised to recompense him, and prays him to continue advertising what should
pass betwixt Prince Mahamed and me.

He was hardly out of Vlama's chamber, when, according to Deliment's advice,
that old Satrap, whom as I have told you he had corrupted, came and commanded
him from the Sophi to go instantly out of the Palace, and the next day to
depart to his Government, until he received further order. And whereas Vlama
importuned him to tell him, why he was entreated after that manner? The Satrap
answered him, That the Sophi only knew it; and that he had charged him not to
leave him till he was out of the Palace. Seeing there is nothing more resting
for me, answered Vlama, but to give marks of my obedience, having given enough
already of my fidelity and courage in other occasions, let us obey without
murmuring. He had no sooner said so, but he prepared to be gone; howbeit
suddenly remembering, that he left all the Letters which I had written him in
his Cabinet, he went boldly thither to take them away; and without knowing
whether it were out of a sense of choler or love, either to teer or preserve
them, he took a little China coffer, wherein they were, the old Satrap, who
walked fairly and softly before, never perceiving it.

But whilst these things passed in such sort, Prince Mahamed, who had laid
himself on his bed by reason of a weakness wherewith he had been taken,
reassumed new forces, and calling for Amariel, he was told that he was gone
forth, but for all that he arose, and caused himself to be led by another to
Axiamira's lodging, whom he found alone, Ismael and Deliment being gone from
thence a good while before, and I was not yet come unto her: For the adventure
of Vlama's Letter, which the Prince had snatched from me, kept me in so great
an unquietness, as I knew not what resolution to take. I feared to discover my
self to the Princess, doubting lest she should take it ill, that I had
concealed from her the affection of the Prince, and that of Vlama. Neither
durst I acquaint Vlama with that which was arrived unto me, for fear he should
imagine, that without this cross adventure, I would have told him nothing of
Mahamed's love; and I judged also that it would not be very easy for me to
oblige the Prince to render me Vlama's Letter, whenever I should be able to
speak with him, which I saw well was at that time absolutely impossible. In
this irresolution I gave the Prince leisure to visit the Princess Axiamira,
who, as I have told you, was alone, when as he came into her chamber. At his
first arrival there, he commanded him that led him to get him forth, and after
he had demanded of the Princess, whether he might speak without being heard of
any but her self? and that she had answered him how he might speak safely; he
requested her to pardon him two things, and to accord him one.

And when as the Princess had promised him that which he desired; All the grace
that I demand of you, continued he, is, That you will not think amiss of me,
when I shall have told you that I have a long time loved Felixana; and the
second, That you will pardon me, if the respect which I have born you has kept
me from acquainting you with it sooner. But when as you have granted me the
pardon of these two things, you must also, to keep your word with me, promise
not to entreat Felixana the worse for it. For though I am at this present not
very well satisfied of her, and that it is rather choler then love, which
carries me to the entertaining of you upon this subject, yet I cannot resolve
for all that to hurt her. You acquaint me with so many strange things at once,
said the Princess unto him, as I doubt whether I should believe them; for to
tell me that you are in love with the beauty of Felixana, and that Felixana, in
whom I confide in all things, should make your affection a secret unto me, is
that which I cannot comprehend, and that which I shall not believe, unless you
give me stronger proofs of it. I did not say to you, replied the Prince, That I
am in love with the beauty of Felixana, but indeed that I love Felixana; And
believe, dear sister, that the beauty wherewith I am taken, though it wounds
not the heart through the eyes, yet leaves not touching it very powerfully; but
in conclusion I am not come hither to tell you what has made me in love, but
only that I am so. As for Felixana, that which has kept her, as I conceive,
from speaking to you of that affection which I had for her, is, that she has
none for me. And would to heaven! cried he, That she had not concealed a thing
from you, which without doubt touches her more sensibly at the heart. Whereupon
he recounted unto her the discourses which he had used to me; the answers which
I had made thereunto; the letters which he had written to me, the returns I had
made him; and at last acquainted her how he had snatched away a letter from me,
whereat I had showed a great deal of unquietness; and that having caused
Amariel to read it to him, he had found it to be a Love-letter, and had thereby
understood that I had been a long time engaged in affection to him that wrote
it unto me, and who questionless (as might be judged by that which he said)
ought to be a man of great quality; That his misfortune not permiting him to
know the hand, he requested her to read it, that he might at leastwise be
assured of the name of his Rival. Saying so, he presented her with that foisted
paper, which Amariel had given him in stead of Vlama's letter, and the Princess
having taken and opened it, without finding any thing written therein, could
not choose but sigh, and lament the misfortune of this poor Prince.

Surely, said she unto him, you have deceived your self in taking one paper for
another, for I see nothing in this same. O Sister! said the Prince, who little
suspected the wickedness that had been done him, speak the truth; you know the
hand of this letter, but out of discretion you will not tell it me, and by this
adress you would draw it out of my hands. No such matter replied the Princess,
and I assure you that I have spoken seriously: Why did you sigh then, continued
he, in unfolding this letter? It was, answered the Princess, because I saw it
was none; and that this adventure which would have made one that had not loved
you laugh, has made me pity your misfortune; but it may be you have this paper
still. No, no, said he, for it was made up in such an extraordinary fashion, as
made me know it, and quite different from Felixana's letters which I have also
brought you, and from which I never parted since I received them. The Princess,
impatient to see what I had written to the Prince, took one of the letters
which he presented to her, and having read it, was as much surprised as before.

I think you well remember, generous Ibrahim, that all the letters which I had
written to Mahamed were in the Sophi's hands, and that those which Amariel had
given to the Prince had been all dictated by Deliment, and written with an
unknown hand. So that whereas the Princess knew perfectly my hand, I cannot
tell, said she to Mahamed, whether you will believe that which I am going to
say to you; but I am assured that Felixana never wrote the letters which you
have showed me. Certainly, answered the Prince, if I could doubt of your love,
I should not believe that which you tell me; but, my dear sister, if I durst I
would entreat you to read them aloud, that I may know whither by any
enchantment the sense has been altered as well as the hand, which Amariel has
always assured me was Felixana's. The Princess, to satisfy him, read two of
those letters, which the Prince acknowledged to be the same he had heard
before. I should believe, said the Princess then to him, that Felixana knowing
you could not see but with the eyes of another, has counterfeited her hand, or
it may be has caused these letters to be written with an unknown one, for fear
l^st some of them should be seen, or lost; but that which persuades me there is
something in the matter which we cannot comprehend, is, That they are nothing
like to Felixana's style, which I know very well; for I saw almost every letter
that she sent to Mazanderon when as she wrote to her Father. I cannot for all
that comprehend, replied the Prince, what trick there should be in this; for
surely Amariel is faithful to me, and yet the letters which I have showed you
are not so obliging as Felixana's discourse used to be, when I entertained her.
At length after they had reasoned well together about it, without being able to
comprehend ought therein, and had sent a faithful person to the Princes chamber
to search for Vlama's letter, they resolved to send for me, at that very time
when as having striven to banish shame and fear from my mind, I had resolved
to go and cast my self at the Princesses feet, and to rely more upon her
affection then on mine own innocence. I arrived then at her chamber just as she
commanded one to go for me; which I had no sooner heard, as I was coming in,
but seeing the Prince with her, and a many of Letters on the Table, with a
paper made up in the same manner as Vlama's was, which the Prince had taken
from me, I no longer doubted but that the Princess knew the truth of every
thing, for I could not be ignorant that she was well acquainted with Vlama's
hand; So that falling on my knees before her, I perceive very well, Madam, said
I unto her, that all my faults are known to you, and that coming with a purpose
to accuse my self, there is nothing more left for me to do, then to beg your
pardon for them, after I had tried nevertheless to render them more excusable
then the incensed spirit of Prince Mahamed would make them appear to you.
Complain not of the Prince, answered Axiamira, since if he be culpable of any
thing, it is of being too little sensible of your fault; which yet I ought not
to condemn in him, since notwithstanding the injury you have done me, I have
indulgence enough still to hear your reasons, or rather your excuses. After I
had thanked the Princess for this grace, I began to recount unto her all that
had past betwixt Vlama and me; for whereas I believed that I saw his Letter lie
by the Princess, and that I was sure she knew his character, I disguised
nothing unto her: But for so much as regarded the Prince, I could not tell very
well how to speak of it; for not knowing what he had said to Axiamira, I feared
to displease him, if I should deliver things as they had past. Howbeit the
Princess, having marked my unquietness; Fear not, said she, to speak of the
affection which my brother bears you, seeing I am not ignorant of any one
circumstance of it: Nevertheless, to justify the relation which he has, and
which you have also made to me of it, I will know it from your mouth too.

Whereupon I recounted all that I have said to you concerning it; his
discourses, his letters, and that of Vlama, but with so much sincerity, as it
served not a little to persuade the Princess that I had done the like for so
much as regarded Vlama, as indeed I did not disguise the truth unto her. But
why, said she to me, when as Ulama testified his love to you, and that you
disliked not the marks he gave to you thereof, did not you advertise me of it?
And why, being engaged in affection to Ulama, did you in an sort suffer that of
the Prince? And why did you not at leastwise let me understand it? Madam, said
I unto her, if you please to hear me, it may be you will find, that though I
be not innocent, yet I am not very faulty. When as Vlama began to be in love
with you, I took no great heed of it; and when as I p^rceived it, I regarded it
not much; but as soon as I began to take pleasure in his discretion, to
consider his virtue, and his generosity, coming to reflect on the thoughts
which I had ^o^ him, I found that he had too much engaged my heart; and I was
in such a confusion at it, as I could never resolve to discover my weakness
unto you. But, Madam, shall I dare to make you a complice in it? and tell you,
that nothing ever rendered Vlama more amiable unto me, then the esteem that you
made of him, and the passion he was in for your service. Yes, Madam, I am
daring enough for it, as also to tell you further, that finding my self every
day more and more faulty, by the increase of the good will I bare to Vlama, and
by making a s^cret of it to you, I could never obtain so much resolution of my
self as to speak to you of it; especially in a time, when as the bad designs of
the Sophi, and the insolence of Deliment troubled your mind so much. For,
Madam, think not, I beseech you, that my silence has been a mark of my crime,
seeing whatsoever obligation I had to Vlama, the respect which I owe to you
has been always preserved; and I never promised Vlama to be his wife, but upon
condition that it should be agreeable to you. This is a thing which I will make
apparent to you by his Letters, and which he can show you by mine. For what
concerns the Prince, I will acknowledge to you, that honoring him as I do, after
those testimonies of affection which he has done me the honor to render me,
and which I have not received but with respect, I thought I should have
committed a fault against you, and been ungrateful to him, if I should have
acquainted you, that this Prince, whom you esteem of with so much reason, had
had a passion unworthy of him. I was unwilling then that you should be able to
accuse the Prince for the same thing, which you condemned in the Sophi, nor
would I have had him lose your love for his favor to me. And to testify to you
how I have thought of his Interests, I would not even let Vlama know the
Princes good will to me, for fear lest jealousy, which always chaseth reason
from them whom she seizes upon, should carry Vlama to be the less affectionate
to the Prince, whose affection I have not received with so much correspondence,
as that he might expect the like from me. And if you please, Madam, to exaamine
the Letters well, which I have written to him, you shall find that I received
the marks of his passion, as testimonies of his friendship, and not as
protestations of his love.

The Princess then taking one of the Letters that was on the Table, opened, and
began to read it; but hearing things which I never wrote: Oh, Madam, said I
unto her, I have not written that which you read. You have not written it, said
the Prince! No, my Lord, continued I, and I am well assured that my memory does
not deceive me. It may be, said the Princess to me, that your Secretary has
not followed your intentions right. I had no Secretary, said I to her mightily
surprised; and whereas the Letters, which I wrote to the Prince, had nothing in
them that I might be afraid they should be seen, I always wrote them with mine
own hand. The Princess knowing by my face that I spoke sincercly, gave me the
Letter that she held, which I presently saw to be none of mine, whereat the
Princess was not a little disquieted. Without all doubt, said she to the
Prince, Amariel has betrayed you, and Ulama's Letter is in our enemies hands.
Ulama's Letter, said I unto her! and do I not see it amongst those that lie
there by you? No truly do you not, answered Axiamira; and then she told me, how
it had been exceedingly sought for, but could not be found.

Hereupon I fell a crying and lamenting: Ah! Madam, said I unto her, if the
Sophi knows that Ulama loves me, what usage, do you think, will he receive for
it? consider, Madam, that he is the only man that can oppose Deliment's
violences; and it may be that he is the only one that has kept him hitherto
from coming with open force, both against you, and against me. The Prince,
perceiving the affliction wherein I was, and remembering how he had understood
by my relation, that I was engaged in affection to Vlama before he had
discovered his to me, suffered his mind to be touched with that which he bare
to Vlama, with the complaints I made, or to say better, with his own
generosity. Be assured, said he unto me, amiable Felixana, reaching out his
hand to that side where he heard me speak, that if I have troubled the peace of
your affection, by that which I have born to you, I will henceforward be the
protector of it; and provided that you will here in the presence of the
Princess promise me your friendship, and will conserve me that also of Ulama, I
do engage my self to follow your fortune, and to employ all that an unhappy
Prince can do, to restore you to that content which I have taken from you. As
we were at this point, one came and told the Princess, that a Slave of Vlama's
earnestly desired to speak with her; I changed color at this discourse, but
presently after I was too certain of my unhappiness. For the Slave, whom Vlama
has sent to you, presented a Note to the Princess, wherein, a little after,
she read that which you are going to hear: For whereas it was not long, and
that we have read it over often enough, it has always continued in my memory.

ULAMA'S Note to the Princess AXIAMIRA.
IF I did not know that in banishing me from the Court, you are deprived of the
most faithful and most zealous of your servants, I should obey without
murmuring, and I should absent my self with joy from a place, where virtue is
not found but in the Princess Axiamira, who, whithersoever fortune does carry
me, may always dispose absolutely of me.


There is no longer doubt to be made of it, said the Princess, after she had
read this Note, but that Vlama's Letter is in the Sophi's hands; and this
banishment is an effect of his jealousy. To tell you, my Lord, in what a case
I was in, hearing by the Note to the Princess, that Vlama made no exception but
of her alone, would be an impossible thing, as well as to recount unto you that
which I said in this occasion; the lamentation that Prince Mahamed made; the
pardons that he begged of me; and the sorrow Axiamira was in, to see her self
deprived of the only man, in whom she confided; and withal, it would be too
long, and too wearisom a discourse; but in fine, the Princess, having caused
that Slave to relate unto her in what manner Vlama went out of the Palace, told
him, That if he had any thing to say to me from his Master, he might do it
without fear; and I having confirmed that which the Princess said to him, he
gave me a Note, which I shall never forget, and whose very words were these.

ULAMA'S Note to FELIXANA.
IF you had not betrayed me, I should have dyed with grief, rather then have
absented my self from you; but after your infidelity, my banishment is a grace;
since I quitted not Felixana, till Felixana abandoned me. I cannot for all that
resolve to part, without telling her once for all, that I part the most
unfortunate of all men living; and that if the end of my life may assure her
felicity, she shall soon be in the estate that I desire her to be in.


The end of the reading hereof was to me the beginning of the sharpest grief
that ever I felt: And the alone thought of being believed unfaithful by a man,
for whom I refused the Crown of Persia, was so strange a torment to me, as my
reason is not strong enough to retain the resentment which I had of it. What!
Madam, said I to the Princess, can you live in a place where such wickednesses
are committed? and against persons that appertain to you? Was it not enough to
banish Vlama, without persuading him by some imposture, which is unknown to me,
that I had betrayed him? and it may be it is I which causes him to be banished.
This artifice doubtless hides some greater design, then the separating of us;
and I greatly fear that this violence will quickly be followed by another; and
that after they have taken from you the only defender which you had here, you
will know by your experience, that you have as much interest, as Felixana, in
the conservation of Vlama. For surely Deliment thinks not so much of contenting
the Sophi's passion, as of satisfying that which he has for you: And this
Insolent regards you without doubt, as a reward that was destined to him for
the conquest which he pretends to make of me; but I am right certain that death
shall deny me her succor, or he shall never triumph in this sort. The Princess
seeing a great deal of probability in that which I said, could not choose but
accompany my tears with hers; and Mahamed was so afflicted, as athwart my
sorrow I saw his resentment.

But at last, for the better clearing of the matter, it was demanded of that
Slave, what Vlama had done all the day, and what he had seen? Then he related,
how one of Prince Mahamed's Officers came unto him; had talked with him in
secret, and given him some letters, which very much afflicted him; and that
immediately after he had received the commandment to be gone. But in what place
is Ulama at this present, said the Princess? M^dam, answered the Slave, as soon
as he had written, at one of his friends house, the two Notes, which I have
brought, he presently took horse, and departed, after he had commanded me to
meet him this night at a place where he is to lie. This man, said the Prince,
must not be retained any longer, for fear lest Ulama's melancholy should make
him change his resolution. This advice seeming good, the Princess commanded me
to go and write to him in her Cabinet, as she also would do; and whereas I
looked upon her, scarce daring to tell her my thought; I understand you well
enough, said she unto me, you would have me justify you to Ulama: and I, said
Mahamed interrupting her, would have Felixana excuse me to him.

In conclusion, generous Ibrahim, the Princess wrote to Vlama, and so did I,
but with so many protestations of mine innocence, as if for that once his mind
was not fully satisfied, yet was it at the least more quiet, and his despair
was turned into a more moderate affliction. Mahamed also would gladly have been
able himself to have sent some marks of his friendship to Vlama, but he was
fain to assure him by the hand of the Princess, that he would always be his
friend, without ever being his Rival again. These Letters being written, the
fear lest they should be intercepted came into my mind; so that to prevent it,
the Princess sent for an old Slave, whom she had proved to be very faithful,
and having given them to him, she commanded him to attend that of Vlama at that
gate of the Ci^y where he was to pass, and there to deliver them to him in such
sort, as no body might perceive it. This providence was not in vain, for this
Slave of Vlama's was no sooner come forth of the Princesses lodging, but he was
arrested by Deliment's order, and asked for the Letters which he ca^ryed to
Vlama; but knowing very well that he had none, he answered without daunting,
how he was ready to make it appear that they were mistaken; and said further,
that his Master having had no time to take his leave of the Princesses, and
none of his servants being with him but he, he had sent him with a complement
to them; and whereas he was hard by Perca's lodging, he would have gone in
there, to give the more color to this officious lie; howbeit they would not
permit him till they had thoroughly searched him all over, to see if he had
spoken the truth: And when they found that he had not that which they thought
he had had, they let him go, and so he finished his voyage, after he had taken
our Letters from him to whom we had committed them.

As for us, seeing the matter in these terms, we resolved that the Princess
should assure her self of them, whom she believed were faithful unto her, by
new protestations of the affection they had promised her. That I should write
secretly to my Father, to the end that if we were enforced to have recourse to
extreme remedies, and that slight was the only one that rested for us,
Mazanderon might be in an estate to receive us. That in the mean time, to
prevent the Sophi, before he had taken his last resolutions, we should publish
the business, complain to all the world of Deliment's insolency; and that the
next morning she should go and request the Sophi to forbid him from ever seeing
her again; because it might be, that he du^st not so easily then propound a
thing to her, whereunto she showed her self so averse, as when disguising her
thoughts in the manner she had always done, he might seem to be ignorant that
she had so much repugnancy unto it. That to perplex him so much the more, she
should send to entreat five or six persons, that were well affected to her, to
be present at the Sophi's rising the next day; and that afterward we should
frame our designs according to the answer he should make. That Mahamed should
by his Governors means do what he could to cause Amariel to be taken; that for
so much as regarded me I should by no means be absent from the Princess, and
that for fear of some violence I should lie in her chamber in the place of ^^r
that always waited upon her there. This resolution was executed, as we had
conceiv^d it; the Princesses friends were advertised, and repaired to the Sophi
at the hour assigned them.

When the Princess came thither, Deliment was not present, for by good fortune
our design had not been discovered: The Princess was followed by all her
maidens, and whereas it was indifferent early, and that she seemed to be
extreme sad, the Sophi believed that she was come to beg Vlama's grace of him;
so that to prevent her; I perceive very w^ll, said he unto her looking on me,
that the tears of some one oblige you to visit me so early, and that Ul^ma's
absence is that which brings you hither; but that I may not be constrained to
refuse you, I command you not to speak to me of it. The Princess without
daunting told him, That though the banishment of Ulama had both surprised and
afflicted her, because she believed him to be the most affected of all his
subjects to the good of his Empire, yet the respect which she bare him would
never permit her to murmur at it: And to tell you what has brought me hither,
continued she, with both a modest and an hardy countenance, it is not to obtain
a grace, but to complain of an outrage which I have received, and for which I
come to demand justice of you, in the presence of those that hear me; for since
I hold the publishing of a crime to be the beginning of punishing it, I would
that all your subjects were witnesses of the accusation I am going to make. The
Sophi was so surprised with this discourse, that in the confusion he was he
never dreamed of Deliment; so that after he had assured her, that he would
protect her against all that would wrong her, she proceeded with more assurance
then before. I have ever believed, my Lord, said she unto him, that having the
honor to be your daughter, you would take my interests for your own; and
therefore I do not fear to tell you that a man whose birth is base, whose mind
is full of artifice, whose bad inclinations are disguised to your Majesty, and
that has nothing recommendable but the happiness to please you, because he
conceals all his defects from you; has had the temerity to pretend to marry
me, and to speak openly to me of love: And though I have forbidden him with all
the severity whereof I am capable, yet when he saw that my respect to you kept
me from complaining to you of a man whom you love, he has continued with so
much insolency, that I was not able to suffer it any longer; for, my Lord,
having the honor to be your daughter, I should be unworthy to bear that
glorious name, if I could endure, that a man, who without your bounty might
without shame be my slave, should be so audacious as to tell me that he will be
my husband. Pardon me, my Lord, if I am carried this way in this occasion,
since this rash man by his insolency affronts you no less then me; and your
interest is no less considerable to me then mine own. Howbeit I do not desire
that you should deprive your self of his presence, if it be agreeable unto you,
but only that you will forbid Deliment from ever seeing or speaking to me
more. Behold welnigh after what manner the Princess spoke; who, to keep the
Sophi from interrupting her, had so much address, as not to name Deliment, but
at the end of her discourse, which strangely surprised the Sophi.

Now though he was very much in choler, and that he had resolved to make this
marriage, yet durst he not before so much company tell her openly what his
mind was: But to disguise the matter; I see well enough, Axiamira, said he
unto her, that Deliment's greatest crime is your believing him to be an enemy
to Ulama; howsoever since you have recourse to my justice, I will neither
condemn nor absolve him, till I have heard his reasons, which peradventure will
not be so weak as you think: In the mean time be assured, that Deliment shall
not say any thing to you henceforward, but by order from me. The Princess would
fain have replied, but the Sophi made her a sign to withdraw, which she did
with a great deal of respect; leaving the Sophi very much displeased, and all
them that had heard her ravished with her generosity, and extremely wondering
at Deliment's insolency, and the little resentment which the Sophi had showed.
At our going from thence we met with Ismael, followed by Deliment, who, knowing
nothing of what the Princess had done, would have obliged the Prince to conduct
her to her lodging: But Axiamira beholding him with contempt, said unto him
with an incensed voice; I forbid thee from the Sophi to follow or to speak to
me; and if thou will know the cause of it, repair to him, and thou shall learn
that at last my patience has given place to my generosity; and that I am
declared thy most mortal enemy. Deliment, surprised with a discourse which he
expected not, could scarce tell what to answer; and we left him so blank, as he
remained a good while in the place without knowing what to do.

But at length, having left Ismael, he went unto the Sophi, who gave him an
account of Axiamira's visit, after he had commanded all those forth whom he
suspected. Deliment saw then that it was time for him to employ all his
address; and to that effect, he cast himself at the Sophi's feet, beseeches him
to remember, how it was by his command that he had declared to the Princess the
love which he bare her; that had it not been for him, he would rather have
dyed, then ever have made any show of it; but after he had been the author of
his hopes, had augmented his love, and had promised to render it happy, he
should rather take away his life, then take from him the only thing that could
make it agreeable to him, and without which he would not conserve it. The
Sophi, who loved Deliment, seeing him in this estate, raises him up, assures
him that he will vanquish the pride of Axiamira, and how in this occasion he
shall see, that after he has dealt as a Father, he will command as a King, and
as a King that will be obeyed. But, added he (as we understood afterward by
one of those that always waited at the Cabinet door, and who from that time
forward gave himself absolutely to the Princess) the possession of Felixana, my
dear D^liment, must give thee that of Axiamira; Haste thee away then to make
profit of Ulama's absence, that it may be favorable to me; for if it were
possible I would have her yield her self to me, and not be constrained to have
recourse unto violence. My Lord, answered this wicked man, there are certain
violences, which have but the name and apparances thereof; and when I reflect
on that which regards Felixana, it seems to me that the force one should offer
her would be of that number. It is true that she has loved Ulama, yet I cannot
think but that the hope of a crown has diminished that affection. We have
indeed seen the letter which he wrote to her, but we know not the answer to it.
Besides, Felixana stands upon her generosity, and because she has promised
Ulama to be absolutely his, she is capable of resisting your Majesty still,
though it may be she would be glad in her heart that she might be constrained
to fail of her word, to the end she might have a lawful excuse. For so much as
concerns your subjects, they could not accuse you of tyranny, since he is no
Tyrant that uses no violence, but to render one happy; that forces not the
will, but for another good; that employs not his power, but for the felicity
of him which proves it; and that in conclusion seeks his own contentment,
without the oppression of his people, and without doing wrong or shame to any
body. For, my Lord, to say that Felixana is of a birth too unequal to yours,
for her to wear the Crown, is to give too strict bounds unto the Royal
Authority. Felixana is noble to satisfy that unjust Law, which will have it
so, but if she were not, that is not to be stood upon, seeing the power of
Kings never shows more, then when it abases the highest, and raises up the most
abased. And it is indeed in these encounters, that they may be named the
arbitrators of the unhappiness, or of the felicity of their subjects. After
such like discourses, the Sophi seemed to resolve to follow Deliment's advice;
but nevertheless before he would execute it, he concluded to speak openly to
the Princess Axiamira touching her marriage; Whereupon if she resolved not to
obey him, they would then have recourse unto force, and constrain her whether
she would or no, to that she was so unwilling.

I have already told you, illustrious Bassa, how he who waited that day at the
Sophi's Cabinet door, overheard all that I have recounted unto you; for the
passion, wherewith Deliment was carried away, permitted him not to have so much
prudence as to speak low; neither did the Sophi's love and choler leave him
the like providence. This man having heard a^l these things, felt himself so
touched with the mischiefs they were preparing for us, as he resolved to
advertise us of it. It is true indeed, that his generosity was in this occasion
excited by a particular hatred which he bare Deliment, who had many times
opposed the advancement of his fortune. At length this man came in the Evening
to advertise us of all these things; after which we also learned that which had
past in the trick that Amariel had put upon us. For Prince Mahamed had caused
his ancient Governor so to deal, as he had laid hold on the Traitor Amariel,
who out of the same weakness wherewith he had betrayed his Master, recounted
unto us how Deliment had corrupted him; and how he had carried all my letters
to the Sophi, who had always caused others to be written for to be sent to
Mahamed; from whom likewise they had retained all those which he had made to be
written to me, to give me counterfeit ones in stead of them. That afterward he
had carried Vlama's Letter, which he had snatched from me, to the Sophi; who by
Deliment's counsel had caused it to fall into Vlama's hands, with three others
of those which I had effectively written to the Prince. We knew then that
Evening all the hurt that they had done us, and all that which they would do
us; whereupon we promised to pardon the Traitor, and to recompense him that was
faithful unto us, dismissing them both, with direction to either of them to be
vigilant for the good of the Princess. After these sad news our tears redoubled
far more then before. The Princ^ss would dye, I was fully resoved to follow
her, Mahamed was mad because he could not assist us; and in so great a trouble
we lamented our misfortunes, without knowing how to avoid them. But in the end
the Princes ancient Governor, whom we had acquainted with the deplorable estate
of our affairs, told the Princess, that in the terms wherein he saw things
were, he did not think it fit for us directly to oppose the Sophi's pleasure;
That love, ambition, and choler, were passions too violent, for one to hope to
vanquish them only by greatness of courage; that the greatest wisdom
counseled, when one cannot decline a mischief, to endevor at leastwise to put
it off from us for some time, because in the greatest matters, one day
deferred, may cause revolutions which could not be expected; that death was not
a remedy but for evils, which had no other then that; that there were certain
dangerous moments, which if by prudence avoided, our enemies can no longer
execute their bad designs; that they were to give the Sophi leisure to reflect
on that which he was going to undertake; and to that end, when as he should
come to speak to the Princess, she should have recourse to tears and to
prayers, rather then to reason, which he would not understand: That if they
should not be strong enough to divert him from his designs, as it was very
likely they would not, she should then request him to afford her some time to
resolve to obey him. And to the end she might not by her sadness give him new
occasions of displeasure, she should demand permission of him to absent her
self from the Court for certain months, with a promise no longer to resist his
pleasure when she returned thither again; that in the mean time it might
happen, that the Sophi might repent him; that the love which he bare me might
be altered, or allayed by absence; but, continued he, the principal is, That
Felixana do not remain here. I know full well, answered I, that I will never
abandon the Princess but to dye. And for my part, said the Princess, I know
full well that Felixana shall not dye without me, and that I will never abandon
her to the violences of my father.

In conclusion, generous Ibrahim, without rehearsing this sad conversation to
you, it was resolved, that if the King should accord Axiamira that which she
was to demand of him, and yet would retain me, I should then desire him, with
all the show of sorrow and tenderness I could possibly express, to permit me to
follow the Princess; it being credible that the Sophi would not refuse me the
first thing I should crave of him; especially not mentioning at all my opposing
of his pleasure. It was not because the Princesses great heart did not resist
the following this counsel, but because she being unable to find out any
other, was forced to consent unto it. The next day the Sophi came to the
Princess, where after he had amplified the merit, the virtue, and the courage
of Deliment, he told her that she was not to take it ill, if he had had the
boldness to speak to her of love, seeing he had not done it but by his order;
because, having resolved to marry her to him, he would have been glad that he
should have got her good will. My Lord, answered the Princess, with a feigned
amazement, if I had known that the boldness, which Deliment has used in
speaking to me, had been an effect of his obedience to you, I had received him
in another manner, I had not termed him audacious, I had been contented with
complaining, and not accusing of him, and had cast my self at your feet to
cause you to change a design, whereunto I have such an aversion, as I cannot
think of it without grief. The Sophi seeing some change, as it seemed to him,
of the Princesses mind, was extreme glad of it; and though he saw she did not
render her self, he believed nevertheless, since she came to entreaties, that
with some patience he might vanquish her. This hope was that which induced him
the more easily to grant her the request she made him, to give her time to
resolve upon it. And truly he had been the cruellest of all men, if he had not
let himself be moved with the reasons, complaints, supplications, and tears of
the most amiable Princess that ever was. But when he had permitted her to go to
Mazanderon, which she had propounded unto him for the passing away of the time
of her exile, as in a place where she had been before times for her pleasure,
he told her that she was to leave me behind with the Princess Perca, to the
end the Court might not be desolated, and for fear also lest my father having
me in his power, should not restore me unto her when she returned. I was in a
corner of the chamber, where I understood all that they said; but when I heard
this proposition, without thinking of the respect which I owed the Sophi, I
interrupting him, cast my self at his feet, and I said so many things, I shed
so many tears, and answered him so favorably to certain questions that he asked
of me, and which concerned the design he had upon me, as at length I found,
that the tears of a beloved person are very powerful arms; seeing the Sophi
granted me that which I demanded of him, though it were absolutely against his
mind. But that Deliment might not have leisure to get the permission which had
been given us to be revoked, we parted away the next morning; yet was it not
without dispatching an express to Vlama, who advertised him of all the slights
that had been used against us; of the resolution we had taken; of the place
whither we were going; and of all our affairs. We left Prince Mahamed so
afflicted, as I never beheld the like grief. As for Perca, she seemed to be so
too, but indeed she was not sorry to see us go; for though she was willing that
Deliment should marry Axiamira, yet did she not much desire that I should be
the Sophi's wife. As for Deliment, it is certain that the permission which the
Sophi had given us no whit pleased him; but to be secured in some sort, as he
is the cunningest man in the world, he did that which you shall hear, and which
extremely surprised us: for when we arrived at Mazanderon, we found that my
father was gone from thence to the Court by the commandment of the Sophi, from
whom he had received express order to repair thither with all speed; and that
by the counsel of Deliment, who as soon as he knew that we were gone to
Mazanderon, persuaded the Sophi to send for my father, before we should be
arrived there; and to ordain him to come another way, for fear of meeting us;
to the end, said he to the Sophi, that Felixana, knowing her father in your
hands, may not carry the Princess to disobey you, nor her self to resist you,
as hitherto she has done. I leave you to judge whether this adventure did not
give us unquietness enough, especially to me. What I said I, must I betray
Vlama, or abandon my father to the Sophi's violence? Ah, no! I had rather dye;
and not able to satisfy both my duty, and my love to Vlama, I will dye that I
may not be wanting either to the one or the other. But at length we understood
by a Letter, which Prince Mahamed caused his sage Governor to write unto us,
and by one that my Father sent me, how the Sophi entreated him very well, and
made him hope for great things.

The first sense of grief then being over, we began to breathe, and take some
rest; But alas! how soon was this rest thwarted? and what a strange remedy did
Fortune make use of, to deliver us both from the Sophi's tyranny, and
Deliment's violence! The Princess, to be free from the importunity which she
received by the visits of three or four women of quality, which came too often
unto her, had for a good while together accustomed to go a fishing; for, as I
have told you, Mazanderon is on the Seashore: At the same time there arrived
in that Port a Vessel laden with the rarest things that come to us from Europe;
but alas! we knew not that he, who seemed not to come but to traffic, should
be our ravisher, and the cause of our greatest misfortunes. Felixana making a
little pause for to sigh, Ibrahim, who was as well acquainted with Rustans
artifice as she; I can, said he unto her, fair Felixana, spare you the pains of
recounting unto me, how that Merchant going to the Castle to show the Princess
some Pictures, and Mirrors, saw you, and knew that it was not you he was to
carry away by force; and having conferred the picture, which had been given
him, believing it to be yours, because he that had sold it, had assured so
much; having, I say, conferred it with the Princess Axiamira, he found that she
was the original of it; and how a^ length having made a show of being gone, he
one day, as you were taking the air on the sea, boarded the Princesses Vessel,
carried you into his, and labored to win her, by persuading her that she would
be happy to be in the power of Soliman: in fine, beautiful Felixana, I know all
that has arrived unto you until your shipwreck; but I confess unto you that I
an altogether ignorant by what prodigy you escaped out of it. Felixana was
going to proceed on in her discourse, but Ibrahim, seeing it was very late, and
conceiving that this history would be long, told her, that how impatient soever
he was to hear it, yet good manners was stronger in him then curiosity; and
that it being unjust to deprive the Princess Axiamira of a person, that was so
agreeable and so necessary to her, he thought it fit she should repair unto
her. How in the mean time, that he might not be kept too long from
understanding the rest of her adventures, he would stay and lodge all night
there in the Castle of the seven Towers, to the end he might the next day also
learn of her what was requisite for him to know for the Princesses service.
Felixana answered him, that she would do whatsoever he pleased; and since he
had the goodness to permit her to go and see how the Princess did, she prayed
him that it might be immediately. Ibrahim requested her to assure her of the
desire and resolution he had to serve her. And as she was going away, he told
her further, that she might take Vlama's Slave along with her, because he had
something to say to the Princess, who it might be would be glad to hear from
his mouth the mavelous Exploits of his Master. Felixana thanked him also for
this favor, and went away to Axiamira's lodging. As for Ibrahim, he dispatched
the Governor of the Castle of the seven Towers to the Bassa of the S^a, about
an affair that concerned the State; and after he had instructed him, he told
him smiling, how for that night he would be responsable to him for the place.
This man went presently away, and Ibrahim was conducted to the fairest lodging
of the Castle, where he past away the Evening, and all the night, in thinking
of his own misfortunes: And though, to comfort himself, he compared them with
those of others, yet found he that his own were far the greater. In the mean
time Felixana was no sooner come to Axiamira, but she told her so many things
to the advantage of our illustrious Bassa, as she was not a little impatient to
see him. But after she had given her an account of their conversation, she
caused Vlama's Slave to be called in, who casting himself at the Princesses
feet, delivered her a Letter from his Master. Ah! Felixana, said Axiamira,
wherefore have you surprised me? and wherefore have you any whit deferred the
pleasure I should receive in knowing that Vlama thinks yet of me? Saying so,
she opened Vlama's Letter, which she found to be thus.

ULAMA'S Letter to the Princess of PERSIA.
IF I did not well know, that to be an enemy to Deliment, were to be the
servant to the Princess Axiamira, I should not be so bold as to write unto her,
after I have dared to bear arms against the Sophi her father. But knowing that
I did not take them up, but to deliver, or revenge her, methinks I may hope,
that she will not take it ill, if I endevor to serve her, and employ the blood,
which I have shed in the service of a foreign Prince, to procure her liberty.
If I obtain this grace, I shall still arrive at the end, which I propound unto
my self; being no other then to hazard my life for a testimony, that I am unto
her the most affectionate of all the Sophi's subjects, and the most obedient of
her servants.

ULAMA.


I make no doubt of it, said the Princess, after she had read this Letter; but,
continued she, speaking to the Slave, who had delivered it unto her, Will thou
not tell me what Vlama's adventures have been? I have order, Madam, replied he,
to obey you in all things, and so much the rather in this same, because I have
an express command to give an account thereof to Felixana. Halima seeing the
Slave preparing himself to content the curiosity of Axiamira, desired her to
defer this relation till she had eaten something, which she consented unto at
the entreaty of this woman, who redoubled the care she had of this wise
Princess after she knew that the grand Vizier was interessed therein.
Axiamira's repast was not long, and Felixana's impatience exciting hers, the
Slave began his discourse in this sort, but it was after the Princess had
caused Halima and Felixana to sit down on cushions by her beds side.

The History of ULAMA.
I Will not stand, Madam, to rehearse unto you the transports of joy which I
observed in Vlama, when as by your and Felixana's Letters he understood, that
she was not faulty; since not doubting of his affection, you cannot doubt of
his resentment of it. But indeed I will tell you, how after that first motion
of joy was over, it was no little unquietness to him to abandon you in a time,
when he foresaw you would have need of his assistance. Howbeit he believed that
it was best in this occasion to obey the Sophi's pleasure, seeing it would have
been utterly to take away the means from him of serving you, if he should have
rendered himself culpable, by not submitting to his commands; resolving
howsoever to kill Deliment, if the matter should grow desperate, rather then
suffer any outrage to be done to you. In this design he went to his Government,
where, as you know, you a little while after fully acquainted him with all the
tricks that had been put upon you; and of the resolution you had taken to go to
Mazanderon. This mark of your generosity, and Felixana's constancy, gave him
both at once a great deal of grief, and a great deal of satisfaction. He was
afflicted to understand the persecution which you endured, yet he could not
choose but be exceeding glad to know by this noble example, that the Crown of
Persia was not so considerable with Felixana as his affection. Now he had not
had leisure enough to think of what he was to do, when as he received an
express command to repair to the Sophi with all possible speed, upon pain of
being declared guilty of high Treason. This extraordinary proceeding surprised
him; for he knew not then, as afterwads he did by one of Deliment's Confidents,
whom he took prisoner hard by Tauris, that as soon as you were gone to
Mazanderon, and that Felixana's Father was come to the Sophi, he would withal
not only secure the person of Vlama, but utterly ruin him; for fear, lest
coming to know that you were at Mazanderoa, he should go thither to you, and be
carried to some extreme resolution. And for that effect, he had disposed the
Sophi's mind to commit Vlama to prison if he came to the Court; and
consequently to arraign him, upon pretext of some disorder done by certain
Troops (which before times had served under Vlama) at such time as they
understood that he was commanded from the Court; representing to the Sophi,
that as long as Vlama lived he should never be at quiet. Deliment was not for
all that so assured of the Sophi's mind, but that he doubted Vlama's return
might change the face of things: For he was not ignorant how the Sophi had
loved him very much, and was obliged to him for more then one victory. He knew
l^kewise that my Masters party was not so weak at Court, but that if it came so
extreme violence, it might peradventure cause a general revolution of the
State, which would not be advan^ageous to him: So that to provide for all the
misfortunes, which might arrive unto him, he had recourse to artifice. And to
that purpose, just at the time when as the Sophi commanded Vlama to repair unto
him, Deliment made him be several ways advertised of the bad designs, which
were upon his life, and carried the matter so dexterously, as the faithfullest
of my Masters friends served to the wickedness of this man; who in stead of
keeping the design of ruining Vlama very secret, caused it to be bruited with
address abroad, ^wo days before he, who was to carry the commandment to Vlama,
set forth toward him: So that when he came to Vlama, he had already received
advice from many not to come to the Court. Even Mahamed himself had caused him
to be written unto about it, but with so many circumstanc^s, as made him see
his undoubted ruin, if he obeyed; in so much as it was impossible for him to
suspect, that there was any artifice in all these things. Some counsell^d him
to seek out a place of retreat amongst strangers; promising to labor the
justifying of his fl^ght whilst he was absent. Others would have had him
fortify himself in his Government. But none advised him to trust to his
innocence. I leave you to think, Madam, whether Deliment's wickedness could
have had a more favorable success? and whether all these things were not
capable of bringing to pass the design which he had, so to order the matter,
that Vlama should not only not repair to the Sophi, but should also render
himself effectively culpable in the eyes of all the world, who after this would
not be so forward in ^ndertaking his interests.

Vlama in this cross conjuncture knew not what resolution to take: for if, on
the one side, he considered the peril whereunto he should be exposed, by going
to put himself into his ^n^mies hands; if he thought, I say, that you not being
at Court, his party would thereby be the w^aker, and Deliment's the stronger;
on the other side he saw, that in not obeying he l^ft his Enemy Master of the
Field; that he furnished him with Arms to destroy him; that he should behave
himself as if he were guilty; and to say all, that he should abandon you, and
q^it Felixana. This last thought made him resolve to go courageously to the
Court; howbeit he was kept from parting so soon, by a sickness wherewith he was
taken: but at length finding himself better, he set forth on his way, with a
purpose to oppose Deliment's malice as much as he could, and to forget nothing
that might conduce thereunto. But scarcely had we made two days journey (for as
you know, Madam, I have never abandoned him) when as we encountered one of his
dearest friends, who came in all haste to acquaint him, that all the Court was
filled with the news of your loss, and Felixana's. That in the Royal House it
was said, how going a fishing you were cast away; but that such, as looked
farther into matters, believed that your loss was a mere supposition; and that
without doubt you were ^^pt shut up in some part. That it was an effect of the
Sophi's passion, and of Deliment's viol^nc^; that in the fashion as the matter
was carried, there was no remedy to be sought for it; that going to the Court,
he should sacrifice himself unprofitably for you, and much to the advan^age of
D^liment; and that in conclusion, the best he could do was to seek a sanctuary
with some Prince, mighty enough to defend him, and just enough to acknowledge
his merit. Ju^g, Madam, in what manner my dear Master received this deadly
news, and how much he res^nted ^n adventure, whereby he for ever lost the hope
of seeing you again; and whereby he saw Felixana in the possession of another.
His grief was so great, that if I could describe it unto you, I am sure the
recital of it would make you shed tears. At first he appeared more insensible,
then afflicted; his silence, his paleness, the little motion that he had, after
he had understood this sad news, and his immovable look, would not permit me to
be able to judge, what new misfortune it was that had arrived unto him, for this
man had spoken very softly. But I no longer doubted of it, when as suddenly
breaking his silence, and speaking with much precipitation; Let Fortune, said
he, do with me as she will, I am very certain that she cannot make me more
unhappy then I am. Then turning himself to him, who had acquainted him with
your loss, wholly transported with grief, and quite changed in his countenance,
Let us go, said he, dear friend; let us go and dye in some remote place, since
I am separated for ever from Felixana. At this word he fell down dead in my
arms, and I believed, seeing him in this pitiful estate, that grief had done
that which his despair would have executed. By good hap we were not very far
from a Country house, whither having carried him with the help of his friend,
we brought him out of his swoon; but it might be said that it was some cruelty
in us to bring him to his senses again, because withal we restored him to his
sorrow and despair. Oh, said he, Felixana is in a condition, that the best she
can be for me, is not to be at all! Oh, Felixana is in the arms of death, or in
the power of the Sophi! Ah! no, no, let us not be so base, as to support this
grief. If Felixana be dead, let us follow her generously; and if she be
another, let us not survive our ill fortune. Then on a sudden beginning again,
after he had held his peace a little; What, shall the Princess Axiamira, the
glory of her sex, and of our age, be the wife of a man, unworthy to be her
Slave? and shall we live after we have so often sworn to her to dye for her
service, and to defend her from the insolency of Deliment! Ah! that may in no
sort be; and since I cannot succor her, I know at leastwise how to testify to
her by my death, that the fear of losing my life has not kept me from opposing
her Enemies. Saying so, he walked up and down a great pace, and seemed to have
some strange design upon himself: But perceiving that his scimitar was gone,
which by chance was fallen from him, we not being aware of it, as we were
carrying him in a swoon to that house; Think ye, said he unto us, to keep me
from dying by taking my arms from me? Ah! no, no, continued he, I shall easily
find wherewithal to end my life and my miseries. Generous Vlama, answered his
friend unto him, we had no intent to take your scimitar from you; since
contrarily, in the estate wherein I see things, it would methinks be fitter to
seek for arms to revenge you, rather then to destroy you: For if Felixana be
dead, you cannot lose your self more nobly, then in revenging her of them,
which have been her Enemies during her life: and if she be not, what do you
think she will say, when as she shall know, that the generous Vlama, in stead
of stirring up the people, of demanding succor of some foreign Prince, of
marching in the head of an Army to assail her persecutors, weakly abandons her,
in abandoning himself to his despair? and entreats her yet more cruelly then
Fortune does, since he will deprive her of the only man that can deliver her,
and the only person whom she loves. And how will you have me deliver her, if I
know not in what place of the Earth she is? That, my Lord, answered I, must be
carefully enquired after: but if you should not discover any thing, yet must
you take up Arms: For if you are ignorant where Felixana is, you are not
ignorant at leastwise who are the Enemies of the Princess Axiamira and
Felixana. I should never have done, Madam, if I should rehearse all Vlama's
discourses unto you. Sometimes he would kill Deliment, though we made it
apparent to him, that it would be almost an impossible thing; again he would
present himself to the Sophi; then he would go unknown to Mazanderon, to
enquire himself of your loss: But for a conclusion of all, he still returned to
the resolution of dying. At length without opposing our selves directly to his
grief, we knew so well how to inspire his mind with choler, as the sole
design of revenging you preserved his life. He resolved then to return to his
Government for to think of the means he was to use for the same. As for his
friend, he sent him back again, and prayed him still to advertise him of
whatsoever should pass at the Court; and to endevor to discover in what place
you were retained; for he made no question at all, but that you were in the
Sophi's hands.

When we were returned, he understood that Deliment had bethought him, to say
no longer that you had suffered shipwreck; but contrarily he caused Prince
Mahamed, and Felixana's Father to be arrested, upon suspicion that they were
intelligent with your carrying away; causing it to be bruited withal, that
Vlama had some part in their crime; and that also preparation was a making to
go and apprehend him in his Government, as rebellious and disobedient to the
Sophi's commands. My Master acquainted with this news, was yet further
confirmed in the opinion, that your loss was an effect of Deliment's artifice.
This thought made him absolutely conclude to think of his safety, to the end he
might be revenged. And to that effect, he retired to a good strong place, which
appertained to one of his friends, where he lay certain days concealed, to
advise of what he was to do; and after he had well considered every thing, he
judged it would be best for him, to put himself under the protection of
generous Ibrahim, whose reputation filled all the Orient. For knowing that
Soliman had always pretentions enough upon Persia, to have a specious pretext
for the recommencing of their ancient Wars, he hoped that by assuring him of
his friends and intelligences, he might peradventure carry him thereunto; and
the rather for that he knew the Georgiens had for a good while together made
many incursions into Comagena and Mesapotamia. This resolution taken, he
dispatched me away to Ibrahim at Constantinople, with one of the most obliging
and generous Letters in the world; wherein he signified to him, that for the
confirmation of what he had written, and confiding in his generosity, he would
put himself into Bitilisa, which is within Soliman's dominion, and not above
four days journey from Vlama's Government. As indeed, I was no sooner departed,
but my Master, after he had written to the faithfullest of his friends, to
entertain some intelligence with them, in case he should have need of it, set
forth toward Bitilisa; and committed himself into the hands of one, named
Serefbeg, unto whom this Town appertained, as Vassal of the Othoman Empire. But
though Vlama told him, that he came to seek the protection of Soliman, and that
he had to that effect dispatched one to Ibrahim; yet this man, being of a cruel
disposition, and provoked by an indiscreet and brutish zeal, in stead of
barely assuring himself of his person, by putting a guard upon him, until he
heard from Soliman, he caused him to be seized upon, to be bound, and in that
deplorable estate sent him to Constantinople.

In the mean time I had made my voyage very happily; and having delivered my
Letter to Ibrahim, I well perceived that he was very joyful of it; that the
reputation of my Master was come even unto him; and that he was not ignorant of
his high birth; As truly a little after, he obtained for Vlama all that he had
demanded; And as he was preparing to send to receive him with honor, and was
talking with him in the Hipodrome, before his Palace gate, about my return, I
saw my Master arrive bound upon a horse, his hands manacled, and his face so
changed, as I hardly knew him: but being sure it was he, without thinking of
the respect I owed to the grand Vizier, I left him, and approaching to Vlama;
My Lord, said I to Ibrahim, suffer not him whom you mean to protect to be so
unworthily entreated; nor let the valiant Vlama be chained like a Slave. Vlama!
cried the grand Vizier: Yes, generous Ibrahim, continued I, you behold that
Vlama, whose valor is incomparable; whose birth is as noble as any in all
Persia; and who has demanded protection of none but you. I had no sooner said
thus, but Ibrahim ran himself to unloose my Master; and beholding them which
accompanied him with fury, he willed me to help him, which I did with a great
deal of joy. As for Vlama, he was in such a confusion to see himself in that
estate, as h^ could almost have wished that I had not named him: but the thing
being done, and having understood that the grand Vizier spoke the Persian
Tongue; These chains, said he unto him, generous Ibrahim (for he had observed
that I had named him so) are glorious unto me, seeing they are taken from me by
so illustrious an hand as yours: And owing my liberty to you at our very first
encounter, judge whether all the rest of my life I shall not absolutely depend
on you? It is true, replied Ibrahim embracing him, that these chains are not
shameful, but for those that have made you wear them; and by a fate clean
contrary to that of all deliverers, I must, after the freeing you of them,
crave pardon of you for the ill usage you have received; yet so far happy at
leastwise herein, as you cannot suspect Soliman for it, who, if I be not
deceived, will make them feel the weight of your chains which have laid them on
you. Vlama answered thereunto with a great deal of civility, and at length the
grand Vizier caused him to enter into his Palace, which was hard by, charging
some of his servants to seize upon them that accompanied Vlama, for fear lest
any of them should steal away, to go and advertise Serefbeg how his indiscreet
zeal was not well received. When these two illustrious persons were come in,
Ibrahim showed Vlama the Letter he had written him, the order he had taken for
his reception; and after he had told him, that he might command in his house, he
went to give an account of his arrival to Soliman, who was so incensed against
Serefbeg, that his anger broke out terribly upon him, as you shall understand
hereafter.

In the mean time the Bassa came back to fetch my Master to the Serraglio: and
as there is a sympathy between great men, which makes them from the very first
time of their acquaintance to love one another far sooner then others do, so
Vlama and that illustrious Bassa grew suddenly to be such friends, as I was
mightily surprised with it. But not to prolong this discourse, Soliman caressed
Vlama extraordinarily; swore he would punish him that had put him in chains,
though my Master employed all his power to obtain his grace; lodged him
magnificently; furnished him with a train answerable to his condition; and gave
him all the occasions that might be to praise him. And, as if Fortune would
second Vlama's designs, the very same day that he arrived at Constantinople,
the War of Persia was concluded; whether it were in regard of that which the
Georgiens had done; or of the Levies which Tachmas had made; or of some reasons
which I could not well learn: So that Ibrahim acquainting Vlama there with, and
asking of him, whether he would willingly serve in it, he was more joyful at it
then I am able to express. The Bassa understanding his intentions, advertised
Soliman thereof, who thought fit, whilst the War was a preparing, to have
Vlama return unto the frontier, the more easily to entertain his intelligences.
But to make him return thither with glory, and execute that which had been
resolved, Ibrahim caused Serefbeg to be declared guilty of high Treason; and
Bitilisa, which the other possessed, together with all the rest of his estate,
to be conferred on Vlama; as also a yearly Pension of an hundred thousand
Sultanins, and the Government of Carahemida, the frontire Town of Diorbech, or
Mesapotamia. My Masters generosity carried him to refuse the spoils of his
Enemy, as much as possibly he could; but the Sultans pleasure was to be obeyed.

This Declaration being made, Serefbeg was advertised of it by some friends
that he had at Constantinople; so that, provoked with anger, he stole away; and
passing into the Sophi's Territories, he went and offered him his service. In
so much as it seemed, that these two Princes had made an exchange, and given
hostages to each other: Though it is true, that the matter was not equal for
the persons, Serefbeg having nothing recommendable in him, but a brutish valor,
which carried him into perils without knowing them. But at last Vlama repaired
to Bitilisa, whereat his first coming he found fit matter to exercise his
generosity upon; for Serefbeg's Wife and Children came and cast themselves at
his feet, and wholly dissolved into tears, humbly besought him to grant them
the grace of her Husband and their Father. Vlama answered them, that had he
been in an estate to receive it, he would have used his uttermost endevor to
have obtained it of the Sultan: but as things were, it was a proposition which
he durst not make. Then they requested him, at leastwise not to entreat them
ill. Vlama, who had no such intent, assured them, that Bitilisa excepted, which
he was bound to conserve for the grand Signior, he would not keep any part of
their estate from them, though they had very great riches; and told them
moreover, that if they would continue in Bitilisa, they should be respected
there as himself; or if they would go from thence, he would obtain permission
of Soliman to have them conducted whithersoever they pleased. This afflicted
and generous woman, seeing Vlama's courtesy, besought him so to deal as she
might be suffered to follow the fortune of her Husband; which Vlama promised
her, and performed a little after. For having obtained of the Sultan that which
he had desired of him for her and her children, he caused all their wealth to
be laden in Wagons; and having assured them of the restitution of Bitilisa,
if peace were concluded, or if Serefbeg re-entred into favor with the Grand
Signior, he sent them with a convoy of four hundred Janissaries into the Sophi's
Territories; for some Troops were already come unto him for his safeguard,
Soliman having given command to all the Sangia's thereabouts to march
whithersoever Vlama would lead them.

In the mean time, whereas you and Felixana were the cause of all that he did,
his only care was to discover if any news could be had of you. He wrote also
to Prince Mahamed's ancient Governor, desiring him to entreat his Master, that
he would, for his excuse of what he was going to do, but remember how it was
only to revenge the Princess Axiamira and Felixana. But hearing nothing of
you, it put him into such fury, and into so great a despair, that his ordinary
valor redoubled much more then before, as well appeared in the occasions which
were presented a little after. For Ibrahim leading the vant-guard of the
Imperial Army, where Soliman was in person, met with Vlama at the rendezvous,
and gave him the conduct of thirty thousand men, to march on before for
discovery, as knowing the Country better then any other. I will not tell you,
Madam, the success of this War, since it is impossible, that in any part of the
world wheresoever you have lived, you should not he^r of the conquests which
Ibrahim, seconded by the valor of Vlama, made; the taking of the City of
Tauris, from whence the Sophi retreated a little before to Sultania, which as
you know is but six days journey from it; the crowning of Soliman at Bagdet;
and so many other remarkable things, as arrived in this War. But I will only
tell you, that in an occasion, where Vlama went to discover the enemy with two
thousand horse, a party of Cavalry almost of the like number advanced from the
adverse Army, and charged him so fiercely, as Vlama stood in need of all his
address and courage to sustain them. He that commanded the Enemy, having
singled himself out from the rest, asked of him in the Persian Tongue, whether
he were not Vlama; and my Master having told him how he carried that name; thou
must, continued he, to render the possession of Bitilisa lawfully thine, either
take away Serefbeg's life, or to punish thee for thy perfidiousness I must
triumph over thine. And then, without attending Vlama's answer, he assailed him
with all the fury of a brutish resolution, notwithstanding the generosity which
my Master had showed to his Wife and Children. Indeed the event of the combat
justified that which I say, for after they had fought above two hours, without
being ever sundered, though they were in the midst of four thousand men, who
were fighting as well as they, in the end Serefbeg lost his life by the valor
of Vlama. But after this particular victory, he would also have a general one
over those who bad assailed him; He so animated his Soldiers then by his
example, as scarce one of the Enemies rested alive. And to testify his
generosity in all things, he caused the body of Serefbeg to be carried away,
for that he would not suffer, said he, that so valiant a man should be interred
in any Country, but his own: and to that effect, though Serefbeg had so highly
off^nded, yet he obtained of Soliman that he should be laid in the sepulcher of
his fath^rs at Bitilisa, which was accordingly performed with all the ceremony
accustomed in such like occasions. As long as this War lasted, Vlama did what
he could to encounter Deliment; but notwithstanding all his endevor for it,
fortune would not let him fight with him.

In fine, Madam, Winter approaching, Soliman put part of his Troops into
Garrison, and retired to Constantinople with Ibrahim; leaving Vlama on the
frontire, where he desired to remain, not being able, as he oftentimes told me,
to eloign himself from a Land, where he believed you were still abiding. Not
long after Vlama being advertised that the Sophi was gone from Sultania,
whither he had retred, and seemed to have some great design in hand, he drew
most of the forces out of the Garrisons, and making up a body of an Army, he
went with it to oppose the Enemy. But the Sophi, who did not desire to fight
with Vlama, saw him no sooner in the field, but he began to recoyl, contenting
himself only with seizing on the passages, and cutting off his victuals,
carefully forbearing from descending into the plains, for fear he should be
forced to come to a battle. This artifice, which proceeded from Deliment, would
for all that have availed him little, and my Masters valor would have
surmounted this stratagem, if the anger of Heaven had not been joined to the
anger of men, and fought for the Persians. For it happened that Vlama, having
had bad intelligence, went and encamped in that great plain, which is near to
Sultania, and as you know is environed with four mountains, whose tops are
always covered with snow, chiefly those of Caspia and Niphates. Vlama believing
then that the Sophi was retired behind those mountains, at the foot whereof
are the goodliest plains in the world, and the most proper to fight a battle
in, was there encamped, as I have already declared; but the Sophi had taken
another way, and was retired into the Country of the Coraxens. As Vlama then
was in this place, there arose on the top of those mountains so terrible a
tempest, as the wind carrying away those huge heaps of snow, wherewith they
were covered, drove them in such abundance, and with such raging force upon
Vlama's Camp, as all the Tents were overthrown by them; most of the Camels
stifled; all the sick Soldiers overwhelmed; some of the others buried alive
with them; and all the rest in confusion.

And whereas the Snow had extinguished all the fires in the Army, the darkness
joined to the roaring of the winds, to the noise which the Snow made in
overturning the Tents, to the cries of the Soldiers in answer to the Commands
of their Leaders, and to the lamentations of dying men, rendered this night so
dreadful, as I do not think one can meet with an occasionable to give more
terror then that did: the constancy of Vlama was not for all that shaken; and
though his Tent was overthrown as well as the rest, yet lost he not his
Judgment: and causing himself from the first beginning of the storm to be heard
as well as he could, he commanded every one to get out of their Tents, and
afterward to keep in their places, for fear lest thinking to avoid death, they
might the sooner find it in approaching to the Mountains. But at last upon the
return of the day, the tempest ended, and the Sun made us see one of the
pitifullest objects that ever was beheld. This deadly sight, able to allay the
courage of any but Vlama, augmented his; and he resolved to be revenged of his
Enemies for the loss he had sustained by the Tempest. Wherefore he made a
speedy review of his Army, and finding that he had lost but two thousand men
that night, he concluded to set upon his Enemies. He sent forth some then to
discover, whilst they were laboring in some sort to repair the disorder of
the Tents; and having gotten an advantageous place, he stayed there till he
understood that the Sophi came on furiously toward him; for whereas reports
increase at a distance, he had been told that Vlama had lost above fifteen
thousand men. My Master, glad of this occasion, albeit his Army was overtoyled
and weary, courageously exhorted them to fight. But, Madam, without
particularizing a Battle unto you, whereof the event was not prosperous to my
dear Master, I will only tell you, that after he had almost vanquished his
Enemies, suffering himself to be carried away by his extreme valor, he was
hemmed in by above an hundred m^n, who knowing him to be the General of their
Enemies Army, assailed him with such fury, as he was dangerously hurt by them
in four several places; so as all that he could do was to rid himself from his
Enemies, still fighting till he got to his own men, where he was no sooner
arrived but he fell down dead amongst them. This accident made the victory
change party, and range her self wholly on the Persians side, who remained
Masters of the field: In the mean time Vlama's wounds proved great and
dangerous; he was carried to the nearest town, and from thence to Bitilisa,
where he has always continued, whilst the Sophi making profit of his
misfortune and absence, regained all that Ibrahim and he had conquered. Howbeit
Vlama was a long time without knowing any of those things: for his wounds
reduced him to so bad an estate, as no affair was communicated to him. And
whereas I was always about him, so often as the violence of his sickness would
permit him to speak, it was always of grieving to dye, before he had revenged
you; but when an Arabian Physician, which looked unto him, had assured us that
he was out of danger, the first thing he was acquainted with, was the defeat of
his Army, the loss of Tauris, your imprisonment, and Felixana's. But he
understood this last by such confused reports, as he could not comprehend by
what adventure you were here. His first thought in this occasion leaned to joy,
and he was very glad to hear that you were living, that you were not in the
power of the Sophi, and that at length he might hope to see you again. But this
first motion being over, he entered into another quite contrary. What, said he,
do I fight against my lawful Prince, to endeavor the delivery of the Princess
Axiamira and Felixana, or to revenge them? and whilst I hazard my life with
this intention, it falls out that I shed my blood for the service of a Prince,
who keeps them prisoners; and Fortune, that is become ingenuous to persecute
me, makes me fight against those which oppose him who oppresses and
ill-intreateth them! Pardon me, continued he, great Princess, the crime which I
have done; pardon me, dear Felixana, the error which I have committed; and
know, that though I am covered all over with wounds which I have received in
serving thy Enemy, yet have I heart enough still left me to undertake the
deliverance of thee. I should never have done, Madam, if I would recount unto
you all that he said upon this occasion.

But at last, after he had used his uttermost endeavor to be carried into a
Chariot, against the advice of his Physician, he was constrained to stay two
days journey from Bitilisa; so that knowing it was impossible for him to
proceed further on his way as yet, he sent me to the grand Visior, with
direction, if he were not returned from a secret expedition, upon which it was
said he was gone, to attend for him, and to endeavor by his means to see you,
and to give you the L^tter which I have delivered unto you; assuring me, that
as soon as he was able to endure to travel, he would come himself to crave your
liberty of the Grand Signior.

This Slave, who had no more but the name of it with his Master, having given
over speaking, left Axiamira very much contented, and Felixana with a great
deal of satisfaction to know that Vlama had still conserved his love to her.
And though his wounds were the cause of some unquietness to her, yet joy was of
most power in her heart. But in regard it was indifferent late the Princess
dismissed this Slave, and resolved, in what estate soever her health should be
the next morning, not to forbear seeing of him who was to be her Deliverer.

The Second Book.
THe hope of a more quiet life having restored the Princess Axiamira to some
strength, it was no sooner day, but having caused her self to be made ready,
she sent to desire the grand Vizier he would do her the favor that she might
see him. Ibrahim having received this Order, went to the Princesses lodging;
but when first he saw her, he remained as much surprised, as he had been at
such time as he beheld her picture; for certainly she very much resembled
Isabella. Howbeit, respect drawing the Illustrious Bassa out of this pleasing
surprise, he saluted the Princess with a great deal of submission, and assured
her that she might absolutely dispose of him; that he came not but to offer her
all that lay in his power, and to testify unto her the grief he had to visit
her in a place unworthy of her, and from whence he would labor to free her in
a short time. The Princess answered to all these things both with very much
spirit, civility, and greatness of courage. But when as Ibrahim would
dexterously have engaged her to the recital of her adventures, she desired him
he would be pleased, that Felixana, who had already acquainted him with part
thereof, might continue the relating of the rest unto him. The grand Vister
turning him then to Felixana, requested her, punctually to recount unto him all
that had arrived to the Princess Axiamira and her after their Shipwreck,
because it was important for their interest that he should not be ignorant of
it. Felixana, who ever since the Discourse which Vlama's Slave had made unto
her, was more a^fected to our Illustrious Bassa then before, would by no means
refuse him that he desired of her, although she certainly knew that this
relation would renew all her sorrows. Wherefore, alter she had received the
Princesses Command for it, and that Ibrahim was set down by Axiamira at her
entreaty, she began to speak in this sort.

The History of GIANGER and MUSTAPHA.
My imagination, representing to me all at once whatsoever I am to recount unto
you, f^lleth my mind with so much confusion and grief, as I doubt whether I
shall be able to deliver things precisely unto you, as they arrived unto us,
and whether I shall not stand in need of the Princesses goodness, to put me in
mind thereof, if I should fail in acquainting you with some circumstance of
that which you desire to know. But to come to my discourse, I will not stand
then to tell you in what manner we suffered Shipwreck; only I will say to you,
that when we judged by the cries of the Mariners we were in danger of
perishing, I approached to the Princess, whose great heart was not shaken in
this occasion, but contrarily feared the Port more then Shipwreck, and casting
my self at her feet, I demanded of her with tears the grace that I might dye by
her. This generous Princess embraced me, and taking me by the hand she never
quitted it, till the Vessel, driven by the wind and the waves with an
incredible impetuosity against the point of a Rock, broke all to pieces, and
separated us, but in what manner it was done I am not able to tell you; for I
was so troubled, and the horrors of death seized on me in such sort at that
dreadful instant, as I knew not what became of me. Yet was not the Sea
altogether unpitiful unto us, for by an extreme good fortune in the midst of
our ill fortune, it carried us to the shore, which was not far off; and not
only preserved our lives, but made me be found within thirty paces of the
place, where the waves had cast up the divine Axiamira in a swoon as well as I.

But admire, my Lord, that which I am going to tell you! and how weak
beginnings have sometim^s long and dangerous consequences! You may well
remember how I told you yesterday, that the Sophi gave the Princess Axiamira's
and my picture to a foreign Merchant, with order never to sell them to any but
Princes: And you have told me, if I be not deceived, that you knew how that
Merchant, being mistaken in selling one of those pictures to Soliman, gave him
that of the Princess Axiamira for mine. Now, my Lord, the same error produced
another; for that Merchant, passing afterward to the place where Prince
Gianger lived, sold him my picture for that of Axiamira; But if the first fault
had been the cause of carrying away the Princess by force, the second
accasioned that which you are going to hear.

The same day wherein we suffered Shipwreck, Prince Gianger (who as you know
remained by Solimans Order very near to the place where we were cast on shore)
walking that way, came by chance where I lay extended on the sands as a dead
person. This accident surprised him; my sex, my age, my habit, which was rich
and extraordinary; and more then all that, the pity whereof this virtuous
Prince was capable, caused him to approach unto me, and not judge me unworthy of
his assistance. And then again, though the estate wherein I was had infinitely
changed me, he conceived that I was not altogether unknown to him, and that he
had seen something that resembled me. But he had no sooner made the sand, which
cleaved to my face, to be taken away, but his memory brought back into his
imagination my picture, which he had bought of that Merchant, and which he
believed to be Axiamira's. And whereas by chance he had it about him that same
day, he opened the case wherein it was, and observing there all the features of
my face, though the air of it was somewhat changed, he no longer doubted but
that I was the Princess of Persia, confirming himself further in this ^pinion
by my apparel, which he saw to be altogether like to that which I wore in my
picture. For the Sophi having found, that the habit of an Amazon, which the
Painter had given us, was more advantageous then ours, would needs have the
Princess and I wear it ever after. In this belief, Prince Gianger redoubled his
care; and seeing me fetch a sigh, which made him know that I was still alive,
he caused me to be carried to the next house to the place where I was; and
commanded some of his people to go along by the Sea shore, to see if they could
find any other person that had need of succor, imagining rightly, that I had
not suffered Shipwreck alone. But scarcely had he given this Order, when one of
his servants came and told him, that some thirty paces from thence there lay a
woman attired in the same manner, and in the same estate that I was, who
without doubt was not dead, because he had discerned some motion of breathing
in her.

The Prince, having left me to the care of his people, went to see that which
this man told him of; but he did no sooner cast his eyes on the Princess
Axiamira (for it was she whom this man had found) but he felt himself pressed
with an extraordinary desire to be able to save her; and the compassion which
he had on her added so many charms to her beauty, as he swore unto me
afterward he had never seen her more beautiful then she was in that deplorable
estate. He himself helped to carry her to the place where they had already laid
me; and though he was persuaded that I was the Princess of Persia, and that
Axiamira was one of my maids of honor, he took at the least as much care of her
as of me, and it might be said that he did not serve me but out of respect and
interest, and that he assisted her already out of inclination. At length, my
Lord, meeting with some women in the house whither we had been carried, they
took such a course with us, as they brought us out of our swoon. I was the
first that opened my eyes, and to whom reason began to give a sense of our
misfortunes, by the astonishment wherewith I was seized, in seeing my self in
the hands of so many unknown persons. But if their faces, their habits, and
their language surprised me, their officious endeavors gave me some hope. This
astonishment being over, my first thought was for Axiamira. Alas! poor
Princess, said I aloud, what is thy destiny! Prince Gianger hearing me speak
thus (for he alone understood the Persian tongue) believed that by those few
words I deplored my own misfortune; so that quitting Axiamira, to render me
that which he thought he owed to my condition, he came to comfort me, and
assured me that I was in a place where the same services and honors should be
done me, as if I were in the Court of the Sophi my father. I was equally
surprised, both with hearing Gianger speak to me in the Persian tongue, and
with his taking me for Axiamira. Howbeit finding my self in the hands of people
that were unknown to me, I resolved not to disabuse them; hoping that this
opinion would make me be with the more safety amongst them, and would possess
them with the more respect: But I would not avouch so much precisely, so that I
contented my self with telling him, that in the estate wherein I was, the best
that could arrive unto me was to dye; nevertheless that I would not refuse his
assistance and protection, seeing he had the generosity to offer it me. These
few words had like to have made me fall again into a swoon, just as the
Princess began to come out of hers, and that opening her eyes, as I understood
afterward, she left them no longer in doubt but that she also might be
succored. But whether it were that she was of a weaker temper then I, or
whether the Sea had tossed her more, she was above four hours before she could
speak; and that was it which kept me from perceiving that we were both in one
chamber, though a Cotton cloth, which made a division in the room, was the only
thing that separated us.

In the mean time the Prince sent for a Charet to carry us to the place of his
ordinary resi^ence, to the end we might be the better assisted there by a
Jewish Physician, who by reason of his age could not come where we were, and
whom we tried afterward to be one of the knowingst men of the world in that
profession. It was then, my Lord, that I was greatly amazed; for these people
having set me in the Charet, the Prince came and asked of me, whether I would
be pleased, that a maid, whom he believed did belong unto me, because she had
been found on the Sea shore in the same case he had taken me up, should come
into the Charet to me? I desired him with much impatience to let her be
brought, imagining that it might be Axiamira. As indeed, he had no sooner
commanded it, but I saw two men bring her to me in a Chair. And truly in this
encounter it fell out well for the design we had afterward, that Gianger was a
pretty way from us, and that there was no body near us which understood my
language; for as soon as I saw her, I could not forbear crying out; Ah!
excellent Princess, live you still? and has fortune been so pitiful, as not to
separate your destiny from mine? My voice revived Axiamira more then all the
remedies they had used to her till then; and as soon as she was in the Charet
where I was, she embraced me with so much joy, as she thereby recovered the use
of her speech, to testify unto me the comfort she received in seeing her self
with me. But, continued she, my dear Felixana, in what Country are we? who are
these that assist us? and what interest have they in our conservation? do they
not pretend to force us to live, to constrain us afterward to have recourse
unto death, by returning us into the hands of Rustan? For, said she, I see them
have Turbants, whose color makes me know them to be Solimans Subjects. Madam,
said I, I cannot answer to so many things, though I have for above two hours
observed with a judgment sound enough all that has been done here. But this I
can tell you, that he, who seems to be the Master of all them I have seen, is
exceeding civil, and should be a man of great quality, so far as I can guess by
the high respect which the rest do give him. But that which troubles me is, his
taking me for you, and his assuring me in our language, that I shall have the
same honor done me here, as in the Court of the Sophi my father. It may be,
said the Princess, I can remember some words of the Turkish tongue, which I
learned of an old Slave when I was a child; and then making a sign to one of
those which accompanied us, that she would say something to him, when as he
came near her, and that she had studied a while, she demanded of him with much
ado, and in a language that was not very intelligible, the name of him that
commanded them. This man apprehended not at first what she would say to him,
but at length joining signs to her speech, she made her self be understood. He
answered her then in his language, that it was the Prince Gianger. This name of
Gianger touched the Princess sensibly, and making a sign to this man, that she
had no more to say to him; I knew full well, said she to me, that Fortune did
not save me, but to undo me; and that she kept me not from perishing, but to
expose me to new miseries; for, said she, he in whose power we are is the son
of Soliman. It is not because Fame does not speak advantageously of him; but
still, he is the son of a man, which has caused me to be forcibly carried away.

Axiamira's discourse seemed so full of reason to me, as I could not make any
Reply to it; but in the end carried by the passion which I had to serve her, I
told her, that to avoid the mischief she feared, Prince Gianger was not to be
disabused of the opinion he was in, that I was the Princess of Persia; that in
the mean time we should labor to know, wherefore he took me for that which I
was not; and that in trying to discover his designs, we should frame ours
according to that we should learn of him. The Princess was so afflicted, as
without examining whether that which I told her was reasonable or no, she
consented unto it at the same instant, when as the Prince, who out of respect
had always marched before, came close to the Charet. This while we arrived at
Giangers Palace, who led me to a stately lodging, and who would also have given
another to Axiamira; because, said he, she was not in case to serve me: But
having requested him to leave her with me, he quitted us, and went out of the
chamber, as soon as that old Jewish Physician came in; who, after he had
ministered unto us that which he thought was necessary for our recovery, left us
at liberty to talk of the estate of our fortune.

I will not declare unto you, my Lord, the cares, the civilities, and the
duties, which Gianger rendered me from that very first evening in the quality of
Axiamira, since it would be to spend time unprofitably. But you shall
understand, that coming to see me the next day, I demanded two things of him;
the one was, to tell me how he knew that I was the Princess of Persia? and the
other, not to publish that I was in his hands, till I had time and strength to
entertain him with my misfortunes. To the first he answered me, in letting me
see the Case wherein my picture was, which as soon as I had beheld I knew it
straight. But, my Lord, said I unto him, who told you that this was Axiamira's
picture? The M^rchant, said he, that sold it to me; and who long before had
also sold another to the Emperor my father, which he said was a maids, named
Felixana, whom the Sophi very much esteemed; whom you exceedingly loved; and
who without doubt ought to have very much merit and beauty, since, as this
Merchant told me, she was crowned as well as you, as the fairest of all Persia.
This Felixana, answered I coldly, had questionless a beauty extraordinary
enough to oblige Soliman to buy her picture. Now, my Lord, it is certain that
this discourse surprised me; for then I knew, that the Merchant, to whom our
pictures had been given, was deceived, and had not understood the Sophi well;
the likeness of clothes having no doubt contributed much to the making of this
error. So it was, that I plainly perceived how Soliman had effectively loved
Axiamira by means of her picture, but under the name of Felixana, which had
occasioned her forcible carrying away; and how the saw error, and the same
change of pictures, was the cause that Prince Gianger took me for her, as the
Emperor had before taken her for me.

Touching the second thing, which I had demanded of the Prince, he easily
granted it me; for whereas he was become desperately in love with the Princess
Axiamira, his desire was not to be obliged to carry us so soon to Soliman, as
maxims of State required: It being unlikely, that the daughter of a great King
should be in his hands, and he not remit her into the Emperor his fathers, as
soon as it was known. So to content me, and to satisfy himself, he forbid
those, which had had any notice of the quality he gave me, to be known of it:
And still, to gain time, I made my indisposition last as long as possibly I
could. In the mean space the Prince, who at first sight had been mightily taken
with the beauty of Axiamira, could not forbear giving her some marks of it, but
with so much respect, as if she had appeared to be that which truly she was,
she could not have been offended at it. This generous Prince told us since,
that he tried to withstand this springing passion as much as he was able; and
that against the custom of his Nation, which considers not the nobility of
blood, he was so troubled to think that she whom he loved was not of Royal
birth, as he could not be quiet in his mind. He had yet some intervals,
wherein his imagination showed him the truth, and wherein it persuaded him that
Axiamira, whom I called Ismaida as long as our plot lasted, was something more
then she seemed to be; and in this thought he engaged himself so deeply in
loving her, as he could not forbear giving her testimonies thereof in my
presence, though he rendered me nevertheless all the respect, which was due to a
Princess, of whom I borrowed the name.

We lived some time in this sort, with content enough, that is to say, as long
as the Princes visits kept us from thinking seriously of our misfortunes. For
when we were alone, the remembrance of what was past, and the fear of that
which was to come, gave us but little rest. The presence of the Prince was
oftentimes also somewhat grievous to me, especially at such time as he pressed
me by his entreaties to tell him by what adventure I had suffered shipwreck
upon that Coast; having much ado to find excuses to dispense me from it, being
not yet well resolved on that which we were to tell him. This Princes love
likewise began to possess Axiamira with unquietness, out of the fear she had,
lest the ignorance of her condition should carry him to some design, which
might be disadvantageous to her. But for me, who saw so much virtue and wisdom
in this Prince, I feared nothing from him; and I made it appear to my Lady,
that this love, which gave her so much apprehension, should rather give her
some assurance; since being retained by the respect, which he thought he owed
to me, and by the love which he bare her, he would never enterprise any thing,
which might anger her, or displease me. In the mean time, my health being
recovered, sooner then I would have had it, and Axiamira's in too good an
estate to be dispensed withal from traveling, Prince Gianger fearing lest
notwithstanding his providence the Emperor should come to know that the
Princess of Persia was in his hands, propounded unto me, with the most address
and civility that possibly he could, the conducting of me to Constantinople; to
the end, said he unto me, that the Emperor rendering unto you the honors, which
are due to a person of your birth, may send you back to the Sophi, with an
equipage proportionable to his greatness, and your condition. My Lord, said I
unto him exceedingly surprised, and without consulting Axiamira, so do, as
owing you our lives, we may also owe our liberty to you; and without conducting
us to Constantinople, permit us to return unknown into Persia.

Gianger had no mind to grant me this request; for besides that reason of
State, and his own conservation, would not suffer him to do so; his love would
not consent that he should for ever lose the presence of one, who was so dear
to him as Axiamira was. And the thought which he had had, to conduct me to
Constantinople, seemed so much the juster unto him, because he should thereby
retain in his Country the person whom he loved. I observed how he looked upon
the Princess Axiamira when I made this motion unto him, and that changing
color he sighed twice or thrice. But at length after he had endeavored to
answer me, he gave me such pressing reasons to let me know the injustice of my
request, as not able to destroy them, I at leastwise desired some time of him
to resolve my self for it, which he granted me very kindly. We were no sooner
at liberty, but the Princess beholding me with tears in her eyes, What say you
now, Felixana, said she unto me, do you know any other way but death to avoid
the miseries that are prepared for us? and whose rigor is so great, that I have
not so much as the satisfaction to find any whom I can accuse for it, seeing
Gianger does nothing but what he ought to do. Madam, said I unto her, we must
make use in this occasion of the Princes error; and with the precious stones
that are on your clothes suborn some one of the Guards that are about us, to
let you escape and conduct you away, either here, or during the voyage we are
going to make, where you will not be so observed as I shall be. Ah, my dear
Girl, said she unto me! in what place of the E^rth shall I find a refuge? If I
go into Persia, I shall meet with a cruel and incensed father; an infamous
fellow for an husband; and shall see my self there without any other
protection, then that of a blind brother, since Vlama is no longer at Court:
If I go to Constantinople, I shall there find a Prince, who caused me to be
forcibly carried away, that I might be shut up in a Serraglio like a slave: And
if I escape out of the hands of Gianger (which I do not think is very easy) to
wander like a vagabond, without knowing where to seek out a retreat, unto what
strange adventures do I expose my self? And then, do you believe that Axiamira,
could she find safety by her flight, would abandon you, and leave you in the
power of a Prince, who, transported by the affection that he bears me, would
ill entreat you afterward. A^, no, Felixana! death has something sweeter,
then all the remedies you present unto me; as also it is that alone whereunto I
will have recourse. Madam, said I unto her, for so much as regards me, it would
be too much glory for me to dye for your service: And if I saw that flying
might be advantageous to you, I would press you further unto it; but since by
your reasons I come to know the greatness of your misfortune, were it not
better for us to confide absolutely in Prince Gianger? and to tell him not only
that it is you who are indeed the Princess of Persia, but also that Soliman his
father is in love with you under my name; that Rustan carried you forcibly away
for him; and that in the end you suffered shipwreck as they were transporting
you to Constantinople. This Prince loves you passionately, and if I be not
deceived, reason of State will give place to his love, which doubtless will be
yet more augmented by the knowledge he will have of your condition, by the
confidence you will put in him; and by the jealousy he will have of his
father. In conclusion, Madam, I can never believe, that Gianger will conduct
you to Soliman, when he shall know the truth of things; and I hope that
regarding him as his Rival, and not as his King, and as his Father, he will
suffer himself to be moved with your tears, and his own interest. And then,
Madam, if the virtue of this Prince, and his love, shall refuse us our liberty,
I will be the first to show you the way to death by my example, finding as well
as you, that it is sweet^r then a life thwarted with so many miseries.

But how do you think, said the Princess unto me, to persuade Gianger, that you
are not Axiamira; that I am verily the daughter of the Sophi; and that it was
Soliman's design to have me forcibly carried away? Truth, answered I, has
lights which makes her to be easily known; and the freeness and ingenuity,
wherewith I mean to speak to Gianger, will persuade him, if I deceive not my
self, that I am no other then Felixana, and that you are Axiamira. For the
next, it is not possible but that this Prince should know Rustan; and when we
shall mark him out the time that he came to Mazanderon, he will remember whether
he were at the Port then or no; or if he be ignorant thereof, he may dexterously
enquire in what place he was at that same time: Moreover, if he perished when
we suffered shipwreck, his death will justify my discourse; and if he escaped,
it is impossible but that the bruit of this accident should be spread abroad
amongst some; and that at least it should be heard spoken, how he thought he
should have been drowned, though it be not known upon what occasion, or in what
voyage. But, Madam, without searching for so many proofs, to confirm that which
I purpose to say, I am confident, how I shall no sooner tell Gianger that you
are the Princess of Persia, but he will find in your eyes the justification of
my discourse; he will wonder that he did not know you; and repenting him of his
error, he will crave pardon of you for it. For, Madam, there is something so
majestical in your face, as I doubt not but you have had more ado to conceal
your self, then you will have to make your self be known. And then again, the
greatest misfortune that can arrive to us by it, is not to be believed, and
that being so, we are in the same estate, as now we are: and in the same
liberty to have recourse unto death.

The Princess, perceiving some reason in that which I said, permitted me to
speak to Gianger, provided that she might be in her Cabinet during our
conversation. I sent then presently to desire the Prince that I might speak
with him, whereupon he came forthwith to my chamber; and when as he would have
used the same respects to me, as he had accustomed; It is no longer time, said
I unto him, my Lord, to abuse your goodness; It was requisite at first, when as
yet we knew you not, that we should be unknown to you, for reasons that you
shall hear; but now that we know your wisdom, your virtue, and your generosity,
it is just that you also should know us; and that the freedom which we use in
acquainting you with out misfortunes, and in confiding absolutely in you,
should obtain us that pardon which we crave for having deceived you. The Prince
remained very much surprised with my discourse, and whereas I perceived it; I
see, my Lord, said I unto him, the impatience you are in, to understand that
which I am to say to you, does disquiet you; and therefore, to satisfy you in
few words, know, that I am not Axiamira. You are not Axiamira, said the Prince
unto me exceedingly amazed! O, Madam, labor not to persuade me the contrary,
since it would be in vain. No, my Lord, continued I, I am not the Princess of
Persia, and you see before your eyes only that Felixana, of whom you have
heard speak too advantageously: yet think not that I will take the Princess
Axiamira out of your power; she is in it, my Lord, and she is in it in an
estate, that has need of your protection: It is you alone on whom her good or
bad fortune does depend; or to say better, it is you on whom her life or death
does depend. And to draw you quite out of the pain wherein I see you, know, my
Lord, that the same incomparable person, whom you have so esteemed of under the
name of Ismaida, is truly Axiamira, and the most excellent Princess that is in
the world. This last amazement of the Prince was as great as the other; but
with this difference, that amidst the trouble of his soul I saw some joy in his
look. He believed me not for all that at first, but I perceived that it was a
matter, whereof he would have gladly been persuaded. Is it possible, said he
unto me, that you should speak the truth? and will you not take it ill if I
should not believe you? or if not being able to rely on your words, I request
you to tell me some circumstances, that may clear me in a thing that is so
doubtful.

It is just, said I unto him, that you should not believe me upon the bare
report of my words, but that your reason should persuade you. And then I
recounted unto him, not only Rustans arrival at Mazanderon; the sleights which
he had used to get a sight of me; the forcible carrying of us away; the
discourse that he had made to Axiamira; how he had given her to understand that
Soliman was fallen in love with her picture, which he had in his keeping; and
how for that cause he had brought her away by force; but also to testify the
more confidence unto him, I told him in part, upon what occasion we were at
Mazanderon, the Sophi's rigor, and the Princesses avertion to Deliment. I made
this relation with so much sincerity, as Gianger found himself capable of
discerning it; and that which yet helped me to persuade him that I did not lie,
was that he remembered, how he had heard that Rustan, who was his enemy, as well
as his brother Mustapha's, was gone from the Port upon a secret expedition; and
had embarked himself at Pera in a vessel laden with merchandise. This
consideration having removed all scruples from his mind, I saw a great d^al of
joy in his countenance, and the questions which he asked of me afterward were
no more then testimonies that he was persuaded.

But why (said he unto me after some silence) do not I see this Princess, of
whom I am to crave pardon for my error? Is it to punish me for the fault, which
I have ignorantly committed, that she will d^prive me of her sight? My Lord,
said I unto him, this great Princess, to leave you the liberty to doubt of my
words, is retired into her Cabinet, whither if you please we will go unto her.
Saying so, she opened the Cabinet door, and Axiamira advanc^ng toward them in
some confusion, the Prince went and cast himself at her feet. Ah! Madam, said
he unto her, how faulty soever I appear in your eyes, my heart is innocent; it
being most certain, that it has advertised me more then once what you were: I
have had respects and thoughts of veneration for you, which I durst not make
show of, in the error wherein I was, both by that of the Merchant, and your
discourse. My Lord, said the Princess lifting him up, your error is so much the
more pardonable, because in taking F^lixana for me, you were not much deceived,
seeing it is certain, that she is another my self. But, my Lord, continued she,
let not the confidence which we have in your virtue be in vain. Nor let not,
Madam, replied he, the remembrance of that which is past be disadvantageous to
me; and for my part, believe absolutely, that there is nothing which I will not
perform to do you service. For, Madam, since my good fortune would have you
unknown to me, that I might take upon me the boldness to testify some part of
the passion I am in for you, which peradventure I durst not have done
otherwise, although it be most pure, and most innocent; be assured, that now,
when as I know how this passion is worthy of the son of Soliman, nothing can
separate me from your interests. Command then absolutely, and be most confident
that you shall be obeyed. I had not much ado to be persuaded, continued he,
that a person, whom I judged worthy to be Queen of all the world, should be the
daughter of the Sophi of Persia; but I marvel much at my blindness, that I
could not discern you were that indeed, which I have so often wished you were.

Since your generosity permits me to speak, said the Princess interrupting him,
Let not the wicked designs of Rustan, my Lord, be executed by Prince Gianger;
let me not be conducted by your hand to the Serraglio; nor let the Princess of
Persia have the destiny of Slaves. For, my Lord, not to conceal my thoughts
from you, I will dye a thousand times over, rather then do any thing unworthy
of that which I am. You know, my Lord, that Soliman having married Roxelana,
cannot according to his Law have any other lawful wife; so that if you put me
into his hands, and that I am not generous enough to have recourse unto death,
this Princess, who all her lifetime has had no other passion but that of
glory and honor, would be the most infamous of her condition. Judge now, my
Lord, whether my prayers be not just, and if I have not reason to employ my
tears, to obtain that which I desire of you?

The Prince heard Axiamira with great agitations of spirit: He was ravished to
see that his passion had so noble and so great an object; but the Sultan's love
gave him no little unquietness; and not knowing what to do, he continued a
while without speaking; but at length he said thus; Do not think, Madam, that
my silence is an effect of my irresolution, I have not been considering whether
I ought to serve you, but of the means I am to use for it. Fear not then that I
will carry you to Constantinople, and believe that therein I shall serve my
self no less then I shall serve you. But, Madam, when I shall be resolved
exactly to follow your pleasure, will it be just, that for saving you from
peril, I should remain the most unhappy of men? That for delivering you from
the violence of Soliman, you should abandon me to the violence of my despair,
by ordaining me to let you return into Persia? For, Madam, henceforward my
destiny is inseparable from yours; and I see no mean betwixt dying and
abandoning you.

The Prince made this discourse with so many testimonies of affection, as the
Princess was in some sort moved therewith. My Lord, said she unto him, I should
esteem my self very unfortunate, if my encounter should prove fatal to you, and
that by a destiny wholly particular to me, my misfortune should be so great, as
to be communicated to the persons that assist me. But I will believe, that the
matter shall not go in that manner, and I wish with all my heart, that you may
have as much prosperity, as I have misery. And that you may know I desire your
felicity, consider to what rigors of Fortune I am exposed. I request you that
you will not conduct me to Constantinople, to avoid the violence of Soliman;
and I request you also that you will not conduct me into Persia, to avoid the
violence of a father, and the insolence of a brutish man, who will both usurp
the Empire, and force me to be his wife. But, my Lord, as I request these two
things of you, so I request yet one more, and that out of a sense of glory and
honor, which are the two most powerful inclinations of my Soul; and it is, my
Lord, that I may remain no longer in your hands: For albeit I fear nothing from
so virtuous a Prince, yet shall I be very glad, that Envy may not find any
thing to charge my reputation with. So do then, my Lord, that I may not go to
Constantinople; that I may not return into Persia; that I may not continue in
your hands; that I may find a sanctuary where Civility permits me to abide; or
that I may dye at your feet. Gianger was so ravished with the virtue and wisdom
of Axiamira, as turning himself to me, It must be acknowledged, said he to me,
that the Princess is incomparable; that I have been blind indeed not to know
her, and to resist the secret motions which advertised me of my duty. After
this he stood a pretty while without speaking, then suddenly beginning again.
If I had not, Madam, said he unto her, found out the means to place you in
safety, and to content my self also, I should dye with grief; but if I be able
to offer you the company of a Princess, whose virtue is without stain, whom you
may absolutely command, and who is wife to Prince Mustapha my Brother, I think
you will have cause to be satisfied. Axiamira was exceeding glad of this
proposition, having oftentimes before heard speak of the virtue of Mustapha's
wife, who she had been told was descended of the ancient Kings of Cappadocia.
So that addressing her self to the Prince with a great deal of satisfaction,
may I hope, my Lord, said she unto him, that Prince Mustapha, and his excellent
wife, will permit me to live unknown in their Palace, until that Fortune, weary
of persecuting me, shall no longer keep me from returning into my Country? Your
virtue alone will oblige theirs to succor you, but if that were not, the strict
friendship which is betwixt us will oblige them sufficiently unto it. All
Mustapha's interests are mine, even as my Fortune is his. And truly we are far
from those apprehensions of State, which for so long a time have made the
children of the Othoman family to tear one another in pieces like enraged
Tigers; and I am well assured that if Mustapha, my eldest Brother, comes once
to the Empire, he will let me enjoy the felicity of his Reign, and will not
send me either mutes or slaves to strangle me. I tell you all these things,
Madam, to the end you may not doubt but that the sanctuary which I have
propounded unto you, will be inviolable. Moreover, whereas Mustapha is Governor
of Amasia, and that City is the Capital of Cappadocia, which we call Amasia,
you may well conceive that you will be far enough from Constantinople, and not
so far from Persia, but that you may easily hear from those which are affected
to you there.

All these particulars having seemed very reasonable unto me, I the more
confirmed the Princess in the design she had to accept of them, both for her
interest and mine own; it being most certain, that I no less feared the Sophi's
love, then she did Deliments. This resolution taken, nothing was thought on but
executing it: Gianger dispatched a man, who was faithful to him, to let
Mustapha understand that which he desired of him; but with such pressing terms,
as it had been impossible for his brother to have refused him. And giving order
for the departure of the Princess, whom before folks he entreated as he was
wont to do, we set forth two days after for Amasia, with as little company as
might be, and in Turkish habits, to be the less noted. I will not tell you, my
Lord, with what generosity Prince Mustapha, and Saraida his wife, received
Axiamira; let it suffice me to say, that Gianger, having left us some two miles
short of Amasia, under the charge of an old Governor of his, in whom he very
much confided, and having acquainted his brother and sister in law with our
Fortunes, they rendered in particular to Axiamira all the honors which she could
have received in her own Country. A little while after all that we had
delivered was plainly justified. For Mustapha understood the return of Rustan,
and his disgrace; and presently thereupon he was told, that the Princess and I
were not at the Sophi's Court; that the report went we were drowned; and that
others believed how Tachmas and Deliment had caused us to be forcibly carried
away. After this we lived happily enough; Mustapha's care, Saraides compliance,
and Gianger's respectful affection, rendered our Exile supportable enough.

Axiamira could not for all that be at rest; she wrote many times to diverse
persons, which were affected to her in Persia, without ever receiving any
answer. And whereas she saw no end of her miseries, she could not be without
unquietness; which at length brought her to a sickness, which it was thought
would prove mortal to her. Her Fever was not very violent, but it was without
intermission; and though she felt no great pain, yet was she so weak, and so
low brought, as we durst not hope she could surmount the disease wherewith she
was taken: during the which Saraida and I never abandoned her; and the two
Princes saw her as often, as the necessity of their affairs, and civility would
permit them. Now though Mustapha had nothing but friendship for Axiamira, yet
seemed he to be as much afflicted as Gianger; such a sympathy was there in all
things between these two excellent Princes. We continued three Months in this
sort, without knowing what we were to expect concerning the Princesses life:
for albeit at length the Fever left her sometimes, yet was it for so little
while, as it did not permit us to hope the recovery of her health. But whilst
I was sh^dding tears for her, the Princes and Saraida took great care to
conceal from the Princess, and me too, that Soliman had made War in Persia;
which was the cause I knew not that Vlama had betaken himself to his party. And
that which kept Mustapha from saying any thing to us of ^t, was not only the
fear of afflicting Axiamira, but the doubt Gianger was in, that i^ she came
once to know it, she would be averted from a Prince, whose father went about to
desolate her Country. We lived then above two Months in this ignorance after
the Princess was out of danger: for whereas we saw no body but Mustapha,
Saraida, and Gianger that understood our language, it was easy for them to
keep us from knowing any thing but what they pleased. But one day as the
Princess and I were alone, speaking of the affection that Gianger hoar her, and
amplifying his virtues, which I opposed to the vices of Deliment, I in some
sort pressed her to acquaint me with the thoughts which she had for him. Why I
will tell you now, Felixana, said she unto me, I esteem of Gianger as much as
his virtue does merit; I do acknowledge his good Offices as much as one can; and
I bear as much good will to him in my heart, as I do to Prince Mahamed my
brother: but for that passion, which disorders the mind, which destroys Reason,
and which troubles the rest of them whom it possesses, I am not capable of it;
and I could wish that Gianger carried a more quiet affection to me. That
weakness is a blemish, which I do not desire should be in great Souls: nor is
it any thing but the subtilty of men which has persuaded us, that this passion
is not vicious, since all others are, and that every one believes them to be
so, though they do not produce such deadly effects. And to know how much more
dangerous it is then the rest, we are but to consider how it commonly stirs up
all of them; Hatred, Anger, Envy, and Ambition it self, are many times the
followers of it; yet do not think, that I will be ungrateful to Prince Gianger;
for know, how averse soever I am from marriage, I would notwithstanding resolve
to be his wife, rather then render him unhappy, if the Sophi and Soliman could
consent thereunto. For, continued she, I may indeed oppose the Sophi's
pleasure, but I can never be drawn to dispose of my self without his order. As
I was going to take Gianger's part, he entered into the Princesses chamber, and
approaching to her with all the observance which he was accustomed to yield
her, he began to talk to her of his affection; and he represented unto her the
respect wherewith he had served her, the greatness of his love, the little
testimony she had given him of accepting it, the deplorable estate of his
Fortune, the small likelihood there was, that after so many Letters vainly
written into Persia, that the friends which she had left, were still generous
enough to serve her. That he knew how the Sophi was more affected to Deliment
then ever, and that he alone governed the Empire: So that she could never hope,
either to alter Deliment, or to make the Sophi change his resolution, but by
the necessity of resolving on that which they could no longer avoid.

I perceive well, my Lord, answered she sighing, that my misfortune is so
strange, as the most ingenuous spirit could not foresee any other end of it,
then such as must be fatal to me; for if I have Enemies in Persia, I have
others also at Constantinople. But to answer the complaints which you make
against me, I will open my heart unto you, and if after that you be not
satisfied, I profess that Fortune has not yet made me feel her cruellest
rigors. Ah, Madam, said the Prince interrupting her, suffer me first to tell
you, that if you deprive me of the hope which my extreme love has made me
conceive, nothing will be able to preserve my life. My Lord, replied Axiamira,
have patience, and do not condemn me without hearing me. And to begin with the
Obligations wherein I am engaged to you; I know that I owe you my life; that
the respect which you have showed to me, in a time when you knew me not for
that which I was, has sensibly obliged me; and that the generosity which you
have demonstrated in providing me a sanctuary, and preferring my interests
before Solimans and the Empires, merits an eternal acknowledgment. I have also
observed against my custom, that you bear an affection to me, and I am so
powerfully persuaded of it, as you cannot desire I should be more: but, my
Lord, if I may be permitted to speak freely, I must tell you, that the esteem I
make of so many rare qualities, as are in you, joined to the obligations
wherein I am engaged to you, could never for all that beget an affection in my
heart like unto yours. Yet do not think I am ungrateful, or insensible; but
contrarily, I love you so much the more perfectly, as I can speak it without
blushing; I, my Lord, I love you with a friendship, so solidly established, as
neither sense nor fortune has any part in it. I can publish it without shame,
and conserve it without blame, and loving you as if you were my brother, I do
not see that you have reason to complain. I know well nevertheless that you are
not satisfied; but what would you have me do, if love be a passion, whereof I
am not capable? and if marriage has always past with me for a captivity, which
is to be avoided as much as possibly may be? I protest unto you by the holy
Prophet, whom we worship, that if I could be touched with this passion, it
should be doubtless for you; never having had that inclination for any one as I
have for you. But let not this impossibility, I pray you, of my being in love,
disquiet you, since the friendship, which I promise you, is incomparably more
excellent, and more perfect. And to testify unto you, that I do all that I
can, if you have not power enough to contain your self from desiring to marry
me, I do permit you to use the best means you can to get the Sophi and Soliman
to consent unto it; which being obtained, I do here engage my word to you no
longer to oppose your desires. Behold, my Lord, all that I had to say to you;
and never hope for any more from me; for Axiamira's virtue can have no further
indulgence for your passion.

Most virtuous Princess, replied Gianger casting himself at her feet, What
occasions do you give me all at once, both of grief, and of satisfaction! with
one hand you draw me out of danger, and with the other you put me to death. You
cannot answer my passion, and yet you love me more then all the world beside;
who ever saw an adventure equal to mine? my Mistress refuses me her love, but
in such a manner, as I am not permitted to have the comfort to term her cruel
and unpitiful; but contrarily, I must give her thanks for the wrong she does
me, and must admire in her the virtue which opposes my love. Gianger, in saying
thus, looked on Axiamira with so much grief, as made me pity him. And whereas
the Princesses goodness has always allowed me a great deal of freedom with
her, I took so much upon me as to intermeddle in their discourse; so that
addressing my self to the Prince, The permission, my Lord, said I unto him,
which has been given you, should inspire you, methinks, with other thoughts,
then those which I perceive you have. Ah! my Princess, said he unto me, (for he
had always called me so, ever after we had put that trick upon him,) that which
the goodness of Axiamira grants, Fortune refuses me; interposing such obstacles
as are not easy to be vanquished: And in the state wherein things are, there
needs a supernatural power to change my evil destiny, unless you will help me
to persuade Axiamira, that she will permit me to marry her; for being then no
longer in a condition to be Deliment's wife, or Soliman's Mistress, the
knowledge thereof would peradventure make their weapons fall out of their hands.
How! said Axiamira mightily surprised, have the Sophi and Soliman any interests
to be decided between them? Is it known that I am in your hands? and may I be
so unhappy as to be the cause of the desolation of my Country? Gianger was very
sorry that he had said so much before he was aware; but seeing the matter past
remedy, and that likewise this War could not be always concealed from Axiamira,
he recounted unto her, that a little after her shipwreck the War began between
the Sophi and Soliman, without any other apparent cause thereof known, then
that he had been told how you alone had made him undertake it; though the
Sophi's subjects had contributed some pretext thereunto by the acts of
hostility which they had committed in Comagena; and then he acquainted her with
the victories which you had obtained against the Sophi, and the conquests which
you had made: He vowed unto her, that neither he, nor his brother had
contributed any thing to this War; that it had been concluded, before they were
advertised of it; that not having a more powerful Confident about the Grand
Signior then you, they could not oppose this design, whereof you had been the
principal cause; and that all they could do, had been to find out Pretexts not
to be present in it. In fine, Gianger told her all things, except what regarded
Vlama, of whom he spoke not at all: and by that which I could judge of it, he
carried himself in that sort, because being ignorant of the affection which
Vlama bore me, and believing that he would be glad to return into his Country,
if he met with an occasion for it; he imagined that the Princess, who had
often spoken to him of Vlama's zeal and fidelity, would quickly give him
intelligence of her being there, and then that Vlama to see his Native Soil
again, and to be well received there, would persuade the Princess to return
thither. And it may be also, as all Lovers are suspicious, that he had surmized
by Axiamira's discourse, which he had interpreted amiss, how Vlama was in love
with her; at leastwise I could not conc^ive a better reason for it; howsoever
he never acquainted her with any thing concerning him.

I will not tell you, my Lord, in what astonishment the Princess was to hear
of the desolat^on of her Country, by a Prince, whose Son had so much obliged
her, and whom she could not with reason hate. Howbeit she was so just, as to
accuse none but Soliman, and Fortune for her miseries. It is not enough then,
said she weeping, that Soliman caused me to be carried away by force, but that
he must also wast our Empire. And it was not enough, that the War should have
an unjust beginning, but that I must too be found on the enemies Party, and in
such a manner, as I am not so much as to desire to get from it. And my
misfortune is such, as I cannot m^ke vows for the Sophi, but I must make them
likewise for Delim^ns, who fights for him, though I have such cause to hate
him; nor make vows against Soliman, without offending Mustapha and Gianger. In
fine, my Lord, said she, turning her self to the Prince, since I am in such a
condition, as I am not able to make wishes without injustic^, I must resolve to
put my self into such a condition, as I may no longer be able to desire any
thing, if it be true, that death is powerful enough to deliver me from so many
miseries. Such were in this encounter Axiamira's expressions; and as for me, I
confess too with confusion, that the Princes discourse gave me an
unquietness, which was particular to me.

For having had no news of Vlama, since the time that he departed from the
Court, I could not judge what he had done during so great a disorder; this
thought troubled me so much, as I could not forbear demanding of Gianger,
whether he knew not what was become of Vlama? and whereas I was afraid, least
the Princess should condemn me for thinking of Vlama, rather then comforting
her, I looked on her at the very same instant, which, as I think, confirmed
Gianger the more in the opinion, that I have told you, I believed he had. For
after he had considered me, and then the Princess, he told me, that this War
having much afflicted him, he knew not very well what had passed in it. But to
abridge my discourse, Mustapha and Sarraida were called in, as well to comfort
the Princess, as to advise on that which they were to do. And whenas Gianger
had requested the Princess, she would permit him to tell Mustapha what she had
granted him, she answered him, that never doing or saying any thing, which she
would have to be concealed, he might acquaint him with all that he pleased. As
soon as Mustapha appeared, she advanced toward him, And will you, my Lord,
said she unto him, be so generous, as not to hate a person, who weeps for the
victories of Soliman? and who sheds tears when she sees the bounds of an
Empire, which is destined to you enlarged? Madam, answered courteous Mustapha,
it is not for me to ask of you, whether you will be so just, as not to confound
the innocent with the guilty, and also to endure the sight of a man, who is the
Son of a Prince, that is an enemy to the Sophi your Father? but know, that if
with my blood I could s^ve that of your Subjects, both to dry up your tears,
and those of Gianger, whom I love more then my life, I would shed it most
willingly, for your and his sake. But seeing this remedy can no way avail your
griefs, receive the word which now I give you, to omit nothing that lies in my
power, which may conduce to the happy terminating of this War: And in the
estate wherein things are, I hold it more ^asie to make a peace, then if
Solimans arms had been less prosperous, and the Sophi's losses fewer; because
ordinarily the victorious Party pretends to no other glory, then that of making
an advantageous peace; and the weaker out of the fear of losing all, consents
easily to yield to some thing, for the conservation of the rest. Mustapha's
discourse being finished, they advised all together, after they had well
examined things, how they might best effect their design; and the two Princes
resolved to confide absolutely in you. To which end they chose out an old
Officer of Giangers, whom they sent to Constantinople, with order to tell you
the truth of all things. But by ill fortune, you were gone away before, upon a
secret expedition, wherein Soliman had employed you, although it was but four
or five days after the Triumph, which was celebrated for him at your return
from Persia. In the mean time, to facilitate things on all sides, they believed
it would not be amiss for Axiamira to write once more to some one of her
ancient friends, and that by this Letter, he, to whom she should address her
self, should be obliged to acquaint the Sophi that she was living; and that he
should also dexterously inform himself, whether by a marriage of her with a Son
of Solimans, a peace might not be propounded. The Princess said hereupon, that
she would never make this proposition; but Mustapha answered her, how it would
suffice, if she did only write a letter, that did make known she was living;
and that did likewise assure, how the letter, which he would write, was of a
person considerable and powerful enough, to treat of an Affair of this
importance.

The Princess, after she had a little thought on it, wrote to the Governor of
Sultania, who had been always very much affected to her; and by this letter
she conjured him to work the Sophi to a peace all that ever he could. But
before the publishing of her being alive, and making the Proposition, which he
should find in the letter, he should send her his Opinion, and acquaint her in
what terms Deliment stood with the Sophi, whom she denoted unto him, without
naming him: she moreover assured him, that the Letter then written unto him,
came from a person, who was able to perform all that he would undertake; and he
that carried it, had order to name him, even Mustapha. The Princes chose a man
for this voyage, who had lived a long time in Persia, and that understanding
the Language and Customs of it, could easily get to Sultania, when once he had
put on the habit of the Country. This Governor, having with extreme joy learnt
that the Princess was living, and transported more by zeal then discretion,
went; without doing ought that the Princess had enjoined him, to Prince
Mahamed, who had been set at liberty, as well as my Father, when as nothing
could be proved against them. For I forgot to tell you, how they had been made
prisoners, out of an opinion conceived, that they had caused us to be carried
away. This man, I say, transported with an inconsiderate zeal, went to Prince
Mahamed, and reading the Princess Letter to him, together with that from
Mustapha, they concluded together, that this Proposition would but exasperate
things, knowing very well that Deliment would never consent to a peace, which
put Axiamira into the power of another, and therefore that it would but inflame
the War the more, instead of extinguishing it.

On the other side, Prince Mahamed, who was not ignorant how much averse the
Princess had ever been from Marriage, could not believe, but that the consent
which she seemed to give to Mustapha's Proposition, was wholly against her
inclination: so that thinking to serve her, and considering withal, that if
she became the Wife of one of Solimans Sons, he should lose her for ever, and
me too, because he knew well that I would never abandon her, and that Vlama
having changed his party, there was nothing left in the Court of Persia, which
could induce me to return thither; he believed, I say, that he was to labor
the Princesses bringing back again, by deceiving her: And for that purpose,
having gained one of the Sophi's Secretaries, they made him write a letter to
Mustapha in Tachmas name, with the Seal of the Empire annexed to it, whereby he
testified his agreement to that Marriage, and past his word to give him his
Daughter, provided he might be assured she was living, by the report of some
person, that knew her, and whom he could trust; and to that effect he should
cause her to be brought to some little frontire Town, where after he had been
cleared of this truth, he would perform his word with him.

This Letter being consigned into the hands of him that had been sent, and he
newly departed, a scruple came into the Princes mind, and a fear that Axiamira
would be displeased with him for this deceiving of her; so that instantly he
dispatched away a Gentleman, that was faithful to him, to the Princess at
Amasia, for to advertise her of the truth of things; and to tell her, that if
she would return to Persia, his design was to lay an ambush by the means of the
Governor of Sultania for the taking her out of Mustapha's hands, if he
conducted her to that frontire Town, whereof the Letter, which he had caused to
be written to him in the Sophi's name, spoke. But whilst he who had been sent
to Constantinople was returning to tell us that you were not there; and that
they which came from Sultania with such different Messages, were upon their way
toward us, there were strange things a contriving in the Serraglio; and the
cruel Roxelana, making profit of your absence, meditated deadly adventures. But
it may be, my Lord, you know them better then I am able to deliver them; it
being impossible but that you should be acquainted with then since your return.

Ibrahim seeing that Felixana attended his answer, requested her once again,
after he had c^aved permission of the Princess for it, to continue recounting
unto him all that she knew concerning the two Princes adventures; and not to
fear speaking freely of matters, wherein Soliman had any part; because it was
necessary he should know all the particularities of this History, which no man
yet durst tell him. Since you are pleased to enjoin me to ^his, said Felixana,
and that the Princesses silence assures me she consents to it, I will tell you,
that you were no sooner departed, but Roxelana re-assuming her former Empire
over Soliman, obtained of him that Rustan might in some sort re-enter into
grace; and that she might at leastwise have the liberty to talk with him; for,
as you know, she has never been subjected to the rigors of the Serraglio: No
more are you ignorant without doubt of the hatred, which she has always born
to Mustapha, since you have been so long his protector. But hear, my Lord, the
most extraordinary artifice that ever was made use of to undo one. Roxelana
following the ancient designs, which she had had for the ruining of Prince
Mustapha, saw you no sooner gone, but complotting with Rustan, she began to lay
the foundations of her wicked intentions. She spoke no longer to Soliman of any
thing but the merit, valor, and spirit of Mustapha. And to arrive unto the mark
which she had propounded to her self, she c^used Rustan through his wiles to
oblige all the Sangiacks of the Province of Amasia, whereof Mustapha was
Governor-General, all those which commanded men of war under him, and some of
them of the places adjoining, to write greatly in the praise of Mustapha to
this wicked man; principally of his liberality, of his courtesy, and of the
affection which every one bare him: because, said he unto them, the Grand
Signior would be glad of it, and would take it well at their hands. These
people were not hardly drawn to be persuaded to a thing, which seconded their
inclinations; and which also they believed would be advantageous to Prince
Mustapha, whom they loved so ardently. They wrote then according to Rustan's
designs, without swerving from the truth; it being very certain, that never
Prince surmounted Mustapha, in shape, in wit, in bounty, in greatness of
courage, in magnificence, in courtesy, and in generosity. Neither was there
ever Prince so generally beloved, unless Prince Gianger h^s brother might be
compared unto him, who though he were the younger, yet left he not to be graced
with the same qualities, which were so eminently seen in the other.

But I am carried away, my Lord, in commending these two unfortunate Princes,
without thinking, how you knew them, not better, but longer then I. Wherefore I
will return unto my discourse, to let you understand, that all these letters
being come to Rustan's hands, he g^ve them to Roxelana; who with a feigned
sincerity, and apparent joy in her face, showed them all to Soliman, as it were
rejoicing to see him have so worthy a successor. The Sultan took delight, not
only in reading the praises which were given to his son, but also in observing
the affection which Roxelana seemed to bear him. So that this wicked woman,
judging how all that she could say would no longer be suspected, one day, when
as she showed one of these Letters to Soliman which commended the Prince; My
Lord, said she unto him, (as good Achmat recounted it unto us, who understood
all these particularities from Soliman's own mouth) may I dare give thee one
mark of my love, in giving thee one of my fear? All that proceeds from so noble
a cause, answered the Sultan, cannot be but very agreeable unto me. I must
then, continued she, tell thee a thought which is come into my mind, in
hearing the continual praises, which thou daily receivest, to the glory of
Mustapha. It is not, my Lord, because I bear him any envy; for Heaven is my
witness, if I do not love him better then mine own children, whom I scarcely
love, but because they are thine. But, my Lord, if the glory of Mustapha be
dear unto me, thine is yet dearer. And I remember upon this occasion, how the
Emperor Selim thy Father used the same slight toward thy Grandfather Bajazet;
acquiring with time such a credit amongst the Soldiers and people, as in the
end he found himself powerful enough to dispossess him of his Empire. It is not
because I do not see well enough that the same thing is not like to arrive, for
our holy Prophet keeps thee so ch^rily, as I need not fear ought that way. But
yet methinks, thy Highness may, without offense to Mastapha, appoint some to
observe his actions; since if they be good and sincere, his spies shall be so
many testimonies, that w^ll speak of him to his glory; and if they be not so,
thy Highness may then provide for thy safety. For, my Lord, as often as I call
to mind the things which thou have told me of the youth of Selim, methinks I
see them all in Mustapha; with this difference notwithstanding, that Mustapha
has a better aspect, is handsomer, is more liberal, and more civil; in a word,
said she unto him smiling, more dangerous then Selim, if he have the same will,
as I shall not lightly believe; nor have I spoken to thy Highness of it, but
that nothing might be neglected, which regards the felicity of thy Kingdom, and
the quiet of thy life.

This artificial discourse made no great impression in Soliman's mind; but yet
it left a su^picion there, which increased with time; and it was a disposition
to make him g^ve credit the more easily afterward to all the ill that was told
him of his son. He thanked Roxelana for the care she had of the good of his
State; and assured her that he should never take any thing ill which she should
say to him. That for Mustapha, he believed him to be too well born to pluck
away the Scepter from him, and to despoyl him of an Empire, that was destined
to him after his death. Roxelana, seeing that this artifice wrought not all the
effect she expected from it, consults anew with the Traitor Rustan, who told
her, that at any rate whatsoever Mustapha was to be made away before you were
returned to the Port, and that the easiest way for it would be to seek to
poison him; for which purpose they were to send a daring and faithful man, with
good store of money, to corrupt some one of the Princes Officers, that waited
on him at his Table. But seeing a great deal of hazard in this enterprise, she
could hardly resolve on it, yet had she consented unto it, had not an accident
fallen out, which made her change her resolution. But, my Lord, admire here the
strange proceeding of things of this world! whilst Roxelana and Rustan sought
for means to destroy Mustapha, and that all their malice could find out none,
that could fully satisfy their cruel hatred, the zeal and fidelity of one of
the ancient Officers of this deplorable Prince, furnished them with an occasion
for it. This man had been his first Governor, when as he went out of the
Serraglio; and was he to whom Soliman, during the youth of his son, had given
in charge to render him an account of his actions: But whereas the Prince had
never done any, but such as were worthy, he could not advertise ought, that was
not to the advantage of his Master.

Now after that Mustapha's age had dispensed him from the obedience, which he
had yielded to this man, he had still retained him at Amasia; conversing a
little less familiarly with him, then with his other domestics, by reason he
was of somewhat an austere humor, and that his former authority did as yet
conserve some awe and respect in Mustapha toward him. This man for all that
loved the Prince extremely, who on the other side heaped wealth and felicity on
him. Howbeit he had a scrupulous virtue, which persuaded him, that though he
held nothing of that which he enjoyed but from Mustapha, yet that he owed all
to Soliman, who had placed him about him; so that without considering the
Princes interests, as soon as Soliman's came to be in competition with them, he
betook him to the Sultan's party. This man then, being of the humor I have
represented unto you, was at Amasia, whilst the Princess and I were there; And
though he knew that there were two women in his Masters Palace, who were not
known, or seen, yet had he not made an affair of State of it, but had believed
that which had been told him, as well as other of the Princes Officers, how we
were two of Sarraida's kinswomen, who for certain reasons would not be seen of
any body. But it chanced for our ill hap, that this man walking out of the Town
encountered that which caused all our misfortune. For to clear this History unto
you, please you to understand, that he whom the Princess had sent to Sultania,
having been overtaken by him whom Prince Mahamed had dispatched away presently
after him, they had traveled together, without knowing that they were come
from one and the same place, and were going to the same persons. So that
falling in talk of indifferent things (for the Persian understood the Turkish
Tongue well) and the War, which was then betwixt the Sophi and the Sultan,
being the subject of the conversation of all those which knew not one another,
they grew so hot in discoursing about it the very day wherein they were to
arrive at Amasia, as the Persian, not able to disguise his thoughts, as he had
done his language and his habit, burst out into saying, that Soliman was an
Usurper; which the other unable to endure, and being become more audacious,
because he was nigh to a place where he knew he should be protected, he drew
out his scimitar, and very fiercely set upon the Persian, who, being more
dextrous, and better mounted then he, quickly decided the combat with three
blows that he gave him, which made him fall dead at his feet. This being done
without witnesses, the Persian continued his way, and almost a minute after he
was out of sight, Mustapha's said ancient Governor arrived at the place where
the combat was fought, and presently knowing that man, because he had belonged
to the Prince, he approached to him, marks whether he gives any sign of life,
and laying his hand upon the region of his heart, he meets there with the
packet that was directed to Mustapha, which that man had put into a little bag
that he had hung about his neck. The sight hereof possessed the Governor with
some curiosity, so that seeing no mark of life in that wretched man, but
contrarily observing all the signs of death in him, which are wont to be seen
in them whose end has been violent, he speedily withdrew from that same place,
carrying the little bag along with him; and being got far enough out of the
way, he opened it, and was much abashed, when he perceived the Sophi's seal.

I leave you to judge, my Lord, whether that exact fidelity, which he had always
observed to Soliman, did permit him to deliberate long upon that subject: he
never stuck at it then; and to testify his respect to the Grand Signior, as
well as his fidelity, he resolves to send him those Letters without opening
them. And seeing by the superscription of that which was directed to Axiamira,
that she must needs be in Amasia, he reflected on the being of two women
concealed in Mustapha's Palace; and calling to mind an hundred petty
circumstances, which when they arrived had made no impression in his mind, he
certainly believed, that the Princess of Persia was in Mustapha's hands: So
that persuaded of this truth, he re-entred into the Town through another gate
then that which he went out at; and without making show of what had befallen
him, he the next day dispatches a man away to Constantinople, enjoins him to
address himself to some of the Bassa's for to present him to the Grand Signior,
and commands him above all things to use great speed.

In the mean time the Persian being arrived at Amasia, and not fearing to be
accused for the death of him whom he had killed, since their combat had been
without witnesses, he comes boldly to the Palace, demands to speak with
Mustapha, and after he had made himself known to him to be a Persian, and had
given him assured marks that he came from Prince Mahamed, he desires to be
admitted to the Princess; which was granted him. And when he had acquitted him
of his Commission, Axiamira remained very much surprised; for she knew by his
discourse, that he whom they had sent to Sultania was too long in returning,
since this man, who set forth a day after him, was already come. She hoped
nevertheless, as well as the Princes, that this unquietness would soon cease;
and believed that some inconvenience having kept this man from coming so fast
as the other, he would arrive at last, and so give an end to their fear. But
the day following, the body of him, whom the Persian had slain, having been
found by some that passed by, he was brought into the Town, and known to be one
belonging to the Prince, who was presently advertised thereof. And whereas it
was a matter of importance, he went in person to cause the Letters to be
searched for, which we believed he had hidden somewhere in his clothes; but
having found none about him, the Princess was very much afflicted at it,
fearing with a great deal of reason, lest these Letters should come into the
hands of such, as might give Soliman to understand that she was in his
Dominions. Yet Gianger in some sort comforted her, by persuading her tha^ this
man, who, as he said, was cunning and dextrous, seeing himself engaged in a
combat^, had without doubt thrown them away, for fear they should be found
about him, if he should happen to have the worst in this occasion. At length,
not able to do otherwise, she suffered her self to be somewhat persuaded of it:
and after she had considered what she was to do, she sent back the Persian
without other answer, then that she assured Prince Mahamed of her affection,
and that he should within a few days hear from her, not daring to venture more
Letters so soon after this cross adventure; and deferring also the taking of
her last resolutions, till they should know what could be expected from you.

But when we learnt a little after, by the return of him who had been sent to
Constantinople, that you were not there, the unquietness of the Princess, and
of my self, strangely redoubled. Yet we did not know all the occasions that we
had for it: for the Sophi's false Letter to Mustapha, and those which were
directed to Axiamira, having been delivered to Rustan, through the simplicity
of him, which should have given them to none but to the Grand Signior himself,
it might be said, how his inconsiderate zeal did that in this occasion, which
all the cunning of Rustan, and the wickedness of Roxelana, could never have
done without him. Rustan went presently to her, and opening these Letters with
a great deal of care to preserve the Seals of them whole and entire, they found
therein wherewithal to satisfy their desires, and execute their mischievous
designs. Roxelana took these Letters with joy into her charge, and as soon as
they had sealed them up again, she sent word to Soliman, that she had something
of importance to communicate unto him; whereupon he instantly repaired unto
her, and was received by her with the accustomed respect, but with an
extraordinary sadness in her countenance, though in her heart she was infinite
glad. The Sultan, who always loved her dearly, demanded of her with some
unquietness, what it was that afflicted her? She answered him, that being
enforced for the good of his Empire, and the preservation of his person, to
discover a matter unto him, which would much amaze and grieve him, she could
not be without affliction. This obscure discourse having redoubled the Sultan's
curiosity, and already even excited some trouble in his soul, she went on,
beseeching him to remember the suspicions which she had of Mustapha, though he
had neglected them, and at length intermixing the praises of the Prince, with
her accusations against him, she presents the false Letter, that was directed
to Mustapha, unto Soliman, tells him (as indeed it was true) that his ancient
Governor sent it unto him; and after she had made him consider the importance
of it, she represents unto him, that if Mustapha came once to be joined to
Tachmas, it would be easy for him to seize upon his Throne: That he was not to
expect the succor of the Janissaries against the Prince, because his liberality
had gained them all; that the people loved him; that the Bassa's feared and
esteemed him; and that in fine this affair was so important, as it concerned
both his Empire, and his life.

Soliman hearing all these things, knowing the fidelity of him that sent him
this Letter, seeing Tachmas seal to it; and coming to consider, that Mustapha
had with address declined the War of Persia, he no longer doubted but that he
was guilty; albeit Axiamira's shipwreck perplexed him, and kept him from
comprehending this pretended marriage. His tenderness of this Prince made him
nevertheless seek in his heart, how he might favorably interpret the
accusations, which were brought against his innocence. But the conjectures were
so strong, and Roxelana's persuasions so powerful, as fatherly affection gave
place to reason of State. He would fain have put this affair into the
deliberation of his privy Council, but in regard you were not at the Port, he
knew not whom to rely on. He propounded Achmat to Roxelana, but she, being in
fear of this man's virtue, represented unto him, that he was too much affected
to the Prince to hope for any faithful counsel from him in this encounter. In
the end she knew how to sway the Sultan's mind with so much address and
malice, as he himself commanded Rustan to be sent for, who was the only man
that Roxelana did not except against. He was no sooner arrived, but the Grand
Signior asked his advice concerning the matter in question. He answered at
first, with a feigned submission, that it was only for him to execute his
Highness resolutions, and not to give him counsel. But after he had caused
himself to be commanded more then once to deliver his opinion, he aggravated
the matter with so much art, and made show of such dangerous consequences in
this affair if it were neglected, as Soliman, being absolutely resolved to look
to his conservation, commanded him to make himself ready to set forth with six
thousand men, which should march away under pretext of being sent to Vlama as a
recruit. That in the mean time, in passing by Amasia, he should assure himself
of Mustapha's person with as little stir as possibly he could, for fear of
causing some revolt in that Province.

Rustan having received this Order, thought of nothing but executing it. And
whereas the Troops, which he was to conduct, were ready to march, he departed
away within a few days, after he had received from Roxelana all the
instructions, that were necessary to make the design, which she had to ruin
Mustapha, succeed. As indeed, Rustan was no sooner upon the frontiers of
Amasia, but he wrote unto Soliman, that Mustapha had gained all the Soldiers;
that they would receive no command but from him; that all was full of
conspiracies; that the people were every where ready to revolt; that he was not
in a condition to oppose so many Enemies; and in conclusion, that his presence
was absolutely necessary for the calming of this storm. Now that which made
Rustan advertise Soliman of all these things, was because he certainly knew,
that the virtue of Mustapha was so generally beloved in all that Province, as
if he undertook to go with open force against him, he would be in danger of
being lost, and of utterly ruining Roxelana's designs. He considered withal,
that if he conducted the Prince to Constantinople, all the Bassa's, all the
Janissaries, and all the people joining together, might peradventure cause a
gen^ral revolution, if they enterprized the taking away of Mustapha's life.

This consideration of his succeeded but too well; for Soliman no sooner
understood so much from him, but he resolved for his voyage. Howbeit that which
powerfully carried him to do what Rustan desired, was the intelligence he gave
him, how by a second Letter from Mustapha's Governor he was informed, that the
Princess of Persia was in his hands. So that Soliman, filled with choler and
jealousy, and thinking that as Rustan had escaped shipwreck, so Axiamira not
being dead might be in the hands of his son, who was fallen in love with her,
parted instantly away, with all the Troops and Janissaries which he had about
him; leaving no more behind then such as were necessary for the ordinary guard
of his S^rraglio. But before he went from Roxelana, she made him promise her,
that he would forget all things to think of his own security. Virtuous Achmat
told us since, that Soliman had a strange combat within himself, and that
Nature and Reason a long time opposed the wickedness of this woman. But at
length she made him see the peril so great, and so near unto h m, as in parting
from her, she got him to promise her two things; the one, that he should not
see Mustapha, and the other, that he should sacrifice him to his own proper
safety. With this deadly resolution he went and joined with Rustan: these
things nevertheless were not so closely carried, but the Bassa Achmat was
advertised, how this tempest was going to fall upon the head of Mustapha; so
that at the very same time, when as Soliman, being encamped near to Aleppo, had
sent the Prince a Command to come unto him, to render him an account of the
Princess of Persia, Achmat dispatched away a Post, to advertise him that some
great design was plotting against him, and that he was accused of something,
wherein the Princess of Persia was mentioned: but not able to tell him
precisely what it was, all that he could do in this occasion, considering the
state wherein he saw things, was to counsel him not to come.

I leave you to judge, generous Ibrahim, whether, receiving at one and the same
instant Soliman's command, and Achmat's advertisement, the Princes and the
Princess were not strangely surprised; And so much the more, because that
Persian was on the very same day brought back to Mustapha, whom Axiamira had
returned to Prince Mahamed, and had been taken upon the frontire for a spy,
though he believed, that it was for that it had been discovered, how he had
slain that Officer of Mustapha's, which came out of Persia with him; so that he
no sooner saw the Prince, but he cast himself at his feet, confessed his crime,
begged his pardon for it, and recounted unto him the combat between that Turk
and him, as I have related it unto you. But whatsoever was demanded of him, he
still maintained, that he whom he had killed had not thrown away any Letters
during the combat, as we had believed; which made us fear more then before,
lest some one had gotten them after his death, and sent them to Soliman. Prince
Gianger was even in despair to see his brother in trouble for the love of him:
Axiamira was in an affliction, which I cannot represent unto you; the fear of
falling into Soliman's hands made her resolve for death; and the thought of
being the cause of the ruin of two Princes, to whom she was so much obliged,
augmented her grief far more. Sarraida, who loved her husband more then her
self, was wholly dissolved into tears, out of her fear of the danger whereunto
she saw him exposed; Mustapha, though more constant, yet was sensibly touched
with the tears of the rest; and as for me, if I may be permitted to name my
self after so many illustrious persons, I was so afflicted, as my own
misfortunes were never so sensible to me.

In the mean time, we knew not what resolution to take, Gianger would go and
present himself to the Grand Signior to justify his brother, and confess that
he alone was culpable: but as soon as he came to think, that he should abandon
Axiamira; that he should either let her return into Persia, or put her into the
hands of Soliman, who was both his Father and his Rival, he could by no means
resolve on it, but fell again into his despair. Axiamira on her part found no
way to escape this peril; she would fain have saved these two Princes, and
saved her self too: but not able to go into Persia, neither to see Soliman, nor
rest safe in a place, where she was no longer unknown, she found that death
alone could draw her out of so many miseries. As for Mustapha, his greatest
sorrow was to see the affliction of his brother, and the fear he was in, that
his Palace would not be an inviolable sanctuary to the Princess Axiamira: for
touching the rest, said he unto her, I am not much troubled. If Soliman deals
rigorously with me, it will always be with injustice, knowing as I do, that I
have never had a thought against the service which I owe to him, and after this
satisfaction, I fear not death. But that which afflicts me, continued he, is
the doubt, that if I go and present my self to Soliman, they will come and do
you some wrong in my absence, and that is it for which I do not see how we can
find a remedy.

Sarraida, hearing her husband speak in this sort, cast her self at his feet to
dissuade him from this design, and to pray him to remember (said she, after she
had craved pardon of Gianger) how exceedingly Roxelana had sought for a pretext
to undo him; that having met with one, he might be assured she would make use
of it to his ruin: and that it was better for him to stay in Amasia, and there
to defend himself, or fly away, then to expose himself to so evident a danger.
But Mustapha's generosity not permitting him to resolve either for the one or
the other; it becomes your affection, answered he, to counsel me in this
manner, but it becomes not the courage of Mustapha to be persuaded by you: and
since I am innocent, I will never fly like a guilty man. For in fine, though I
seem to have failed, according to rigorous and exact policy, in not advertising
Soliman that the daughter of his Enemy was in my power, yet I think that I
swerve not much from sovereign Reason in serving so excellent a Princess and my
brother; and in contributing nothing to the Sultan's unjust love, so that after
this Interior satisfaction, I will remit my innocence to the conduct of Heaven,
which is always the protector of it. Gianger seeing his resolution, desired
Axiamira, not to take it ill if he went to dye with his brother; but Mustapha,
without giving the Princess leisure to answer, told him, that he would not
suffer it, but he would leave him to guard the Princess Axiamira, and his dear
Sarraida.

I should never have done, if I would report unto you all that, which love,
fear, generosity, and despair, made these illustrious persons say in this sad
conversation. As for me, I heard all their discourse without speaking: when as
on a sudden, the desire which I had to serve them inspired me with a mean,
whereby I believed I could save Mustapha, secure Axiamira, dry up Sarraida's
tears, render Gianger more excusable, signalize the affection which I bare the
Princess, and destroy all the wicked designs of Mustapha's Enemies. Verily this
thought possessed me with so extraordinary a joy, as it quickly appeared in my
eyes amidst the tears which I shed: but whereas I feared that the Princesses
generosity would be an obstacle to my design, I fell at her feet, and besought
her to give me her word, that she would not refuse a mean, which I thought I
had found to draw them all out of the pain and danger wherein I saw them. Ah,
my dear maid, said she unto me, do thou think that a person which would
receive death with joy, if it were presented unto her, can refuse thy
assistance? but I greatly fear, continued she, that thy affection does but
abuse thee, and that the extreme desire thou have to serve me makes thee
believe that to be easy, which I hold impossible. No, no, Madam, answered I;
and provided you will promise me not to oppose this design, I assure you that
you your self will find a great deal of probability in it.

Sarraida, seeing that Axiamira made not much haste to answer me, pressed her so
far, as she gave me her word to do all that I would have her. She had no sooner
said so, but rendering her thanks for the permission she gave me to serve her,
I imparted unto her in what manner I hoped to secure her. And to make her
comprehend it the better, I caused her to remember, how the same Merchant who
sold her picture to Soliman, as being mine, had also sold mine to Prince
Gianger, as being hers: So that to draw them out of the trouble wherein they
were, and to put her in safety, Mustapha was to conduct me to Soliman, seeming
to believe that I was the Princess of Persia; which he was likewise to confirm
by the picture that Prince Gianger had of me, and by the testimony of the
Merchant who had sold it unto him. And withal Soliman, by his own experience,
would not have much ado to believe, that the Prince might have been deceived,
as well as himself. That in this sort Mustapha might deny the having of the
right Princess of Persia in his hands, and consequently that she would be in
safety. That for me, I was to say, how having been found on the Sea-shoar after
our shipwreck, they had presented me to Sarraida, who out of her goodness had
received me into her Palace, where I had almost ever since been sick: And that
not above eight days before, Gianger had seen me at his brothers, and taken me
for the Princess of Persia, by means of my picture that he had. That instantly
thereupon he purposed to have carried me to Constantinople; being ready to set
forth on that voyage, just as he received Soliman's command. I told them
further, that if by ill fortune the Letters from Persia, which had been lost,
were in the Sultan's hands, he was boldly to deny any knowledge thereof, since
no body could convince him of it. And that he was to say, how without doubt it
was an artifice of his Enemies, who having understood by some way, unknown to
him, that the Princess of Persia was in his power, had counterfeited those
Letters, for to bring him into hatred with Soliman. And as for me, said I to
the Princess, never trouble your self, Heaven, which has inspired me with this
design, knows how to preserve me, if I be worthy of protection; if not, I shall
still dye with joy, if I dye for the saving of so many excellent persons. Ah,
Felixana! said the Princess unto me, I will not be saved with the loss of you;
and if your zeal carries you to this resolution, reason will not let me consent
unto it. You have promised it me, Madam; said I interrupting her; and I cannot
think that a great Princess will ever break her word. And then again I do not
see that my loss is undoubted; for howsoever, continued I, Soliman cannot
accuse me but for a little while receiving the honors, which were rendered to
me as to the Princess of Persia, though I were not she; but thereunto I am to
say, that to be in the more safety out of the respect which was believed to be
due to my condition, I had not disabused the Prince, staying to make my self
known for that which I was, till I was at his Highness feet, to beg his pardon,
and to beseech him to grant me my liberty.

Sarraida, seeing a great deal of likelihood in that which I said, earnestly
entreated Axiamira no longer to resist this design. Gianger called me his
Deliverer, and said such obliging things unto me, as I shall never forget the
remembrance of them. For Mustapha, though he saw some probability of that which
I propounded, yet his great heart could not resolve to disguise the truth; and
had he not certainly known, that it was the only way which could permit him to
hope, that he might put the Princess Axiamira in safety, he had never consented
unto it. But that consideration, joined to the extreme affection which he
carried to his brother, made him resolve at length for all that was desired of
him. We prepared our selves then to depart the next day; I will not relate unto
you what the separation was between the Princess and me, between Gianger and
Mustapha, between Mustapha and Sarraida, since it would but renew our sorrows
for a matter that is not absolutely necessary you should know. But I will only
tell you, that the separation of the Soul and body is never made with such
violent grief as ours was, at the sad moment of that deadly and last farewell.
I was put into a Charet, with two women which Sarraida gave me to wait upon me,
and Mustapha accompanied with a small train, to show the more confidence,
marched on horseback some fifty paces before us. We arrived at the Emperors
Camp a day later then we thought we should, because the Charet, wherein I was,
being broken, took up so much time to re-accommodate it. And you will know, my
Lord, by the sequel of my discourse, how it is not without cause that I have
noted this unto you. We were no sooner lighted at a Tent, which had been
prepared for us, but Prince Mustapha, who thought he should have conducted me
to Soliman, received an Order to attend his Commandments there, and to remit me
into the hands of a Bassa, who was to present me to his Highness. I confess
that this proceeding amazed me, and that I began to be in fear for the Prince.
At the very same instant he received sundry advices, that his ruin was
resolved and certain, if he did not repel force with force: the Chieftains of
the Army, and the Aga of the Janissaries gave him to understand, that if he
would they would rebel, and not only save his life, but set the Crown upon his
head. To all this he answered nothing, save that he might well be unhappy, but
he could never be guilty; that he had rather dye with injustice, then reign
unjustly; and in sine that their zeal going too far for the love of him, he
could not recompense them better for it, then in keeping them from offending.
As for me, when I went out of his Tent with tears in my eyes, he requested me,
that at my coming before Soliman I should obtain of him, that he might in
person justify himself of the accusations that were brought against his
innocence; and that he would be so good as not to condemn him without hearing
him. I promised him all that he desired of me, without scarcely knowing what I
did, so much was my mind troubled, through the fear I was in, that my design
would not succeed. Howbeit I strove to settle my countenance before I should
appear before Soliman; the Bassa that conducted me had the goodness not to
hasten me too much, so that I had the leisure to recollect my self a little. I
was made to pass through three Tents, before I arrived at the Sultans, but
every one that I saw seemed so sad unto me, and I heard Mustapha so often named
softly, as from that very time I perceived but too well that he was utterly
lost.

At my first appearance Soliman seemed to be very much surprised; and beholding
me with an angry look, he demanded of the Bassa that brought me, where the
Princess of Persia was? My Lord, said he unto him, Prince Mustapha delivered no
other then this person unto me, whom I saw him treat as if she were the
Princess of Persia. I no sooner heard this answer (for I had already learned a
little of your language) but I cast my self at the Sultans feet, and humbly
besought him to hear me. I will hear no lying, answered he. My Lord, replied I,
it is not to keep thy Highness from punishing it, that I beg the favor of thee
to be heard, but to keep thee from confounding the innocent with the guilty;
for in fine, my Lord, I am faulty, and Mustapha is absolutely innocent. I would
I had given thee, answered the grand Signior thereupon, the half of my Empire,
that Mustapha were not guilty. My Lord, replied I with more confidence then
before, I do crave but two things of thee to give thee that satisfaction; the
one is, that thou will hear me without interrupting me; and the other, that
thou will permit the Prince to justify himself in person. This last, answered
he, is impossible, but for the other I do grant it thee; and promise thee
moreover, that if thou do justify Mustapha (which I do not believe thou
can do) there is nothing which thou shall not obtain of me. I did not yield
at the very first; I besought him that he would see the Prince; I labored to
vanquish him with my reasons; but at last seeing I nothing prevailed, I
declared the matter unto him, as we had resolved it; and that with so much
ingenuity, as I well perceived he believed me. I repeated this History from
Rustans arrival at Mazanderon, and coming to speak of our shipwreck, I lamented
the loss of the Princess, I spoke of her as believing her to be dead; and
recounted also, how Sarraida had received me from those, who had found me on
the Sea-shoar; and consequently, how a little before Prince Gianger, having
seen me with Sarraida, where I had been for the most part sick, had believed
that I was the Princess of Persia, by reason of a picture which he had of me,
and which a Merchant, who had deceived him, had sold him for Axiamira's: I told
him moreover, that as soon as Mustapha was persuaded, that I was the Princess
of Persia, he had prepared himself for the conducting of me to his Highness.
That for me, I had not disabused him, as well to be the more secured, as for
that I hoped I should the more easily obtain my liberty, when as I should
request it of him by the memory of the unfortunate Axiamira.

Soliman, moved with my words, fetched a great sigh, and testified both by his
carriage and his discourse, that he was afflicted for the loss of the Princess;
and yet that he had some joy, in regard he could hope that Mustapha was not so
faulty as he had believed him to be, and that in the end he might justify
himself. In this thought, the Sultan spoke very gently unto me; and truly I
must acknowledge, that I never saw a more charming Majesty, then that of this
Prince. But, generous Ibrahim, of how short a continuance was that happy
instant! for you must know, that Rustan, the wickedest of men, set forth with
Soliman's consent at that very time, when as Mustapha was sent for to come to
the Camp: but he went to Amasia through a by-way, followed by a thousand
archers on horseback; having sent two spies into that Town, to advertise him
when Mustapha was gone from thence, to the end he might take Sarraida, and from
her draw out the truth, in case the Prince should deny it: this cunning brain
imagining, that a jealous woman would be capable of telling all. But the
principal subject of that voyage, was to seize upon the Princess of Persia, if
the Prince did not bring her along with him; and to search in Mustapha's
Cabinet for some other Letters from the Sophi, which might also convince him of
intelligence with the Enemies of the State. So that one day after we were
parted from Amasia Rustan arrived there, with an absolute Order, to him that
commanded in that place in the absence of Mustapha, to obey Rustan as if it
were his Highness himself. You know, my Lord, that these kind of commands do
seldom find any rebellious in this Empire: and since there have been many
times Bassa's seen, who have sent their Heads, although they have been Generals
of Armies, and that they have been required of them but by one man, accompanied
only with four Mutes; I think you will not think it less strange, that the
Governor of Amasia, albeit much affected to Mustapha, should notwithstanding
open him the gates, as soon as he had seen Rustan's power, and that too without
consulting with Prince Gianger thereupon.

I leave you to imagine in what a case this Prince was when he beheld Rustan at
Mustapha's Palace gate, followed by so great a number of armed men. The first
thing he did, was to go with speed to Axiamira's lodging, either to endevor the
saving of her, or to dye in her defense. But this thought of affection was
that, which caused her to be taken the more easily; for Rustan had no sooner
marked the way which Gianger took, but leaving one part of his forces at the
gate, he followed the Prince in haste with the other, even to Axiamira's
chamber, whereinto he entered by force with him. Judge, illustrious Bassa, what
beca^^ of the Princess when she saw Rustan, whom she presently knew. Ah base v
llain! cry^^ she, come thou now to carry me away forcibly a second time? He
must first, said Gia^ge^ with a great deal of fury, take away my life thus
unarmed as I am. I will do neither the one nor the other, answered wicked
Rustan, who would not be constrained to come to violence against the son of
Roxelana; but I will only execute the Grand Signior's Order, who has
commanded me to bring him all the papers which shall be found in Mustapha's
Cabinet. Sarraida, who was with Axiamira, and knew well enough that there could
be nothing found which might be prejudicial to her husband, went her self and
showed him the door of it. In the mean time, to separate Gianger from the
Princess, Rustan told him that he had a matter of importance to communicate
unto him; but the Prince answered him, that having no interest severed from
Axiamira, he might speak before her.

Rustan surprised with the liberty of this discourse, began to deal in another
manner; and letting Gianger see the absolute power which he had, he put the
Princess into despair, and Gianger into fury, who, without considering that his
resistance would render him culpable, left not, quite unarmed as he was, to do
strange things in opposition of Axiamira's carrying away by force. He would
have snatched Rustan's scimitar from him, to have used it against him, and
doubtless he had done it, if those with whom he was accompanied had not hindered
him. He sought all about the chamber for something wherewith he might have
defended himself; but at length seeing all his endevors vain, he past from one
extremity to another, and after he had exceedingly reviled him, he on a sudden
conjured him with tears in his eyes, that he would have some pity on him in the
person of the Princess Axiamira; that he would remember he was the son of
Roxelana, whose daughter he had married, being assured if the Sultana his
Mother knew his designs, she would approve of them; that he would consider how
Mustapha coming one day to reign, he could not meet with a better occasion to
secure his fortune, then to oblige him in this encounter; that besides, knowing
how considerable the interests of the Sultana Queen were to him, he found that
he should not do her any very good service in conducting a Princess to Soliman,
with whom he was desperately in love.

To all these things, Rustan answered with an insolent coldness, how he
remembered very well, that he was the son of Roxelana, and for that only reason
Soliman should not know of the resistance he made to the execution of his
commandments; that he feared not the disobliging of Roxelana by conducting
Axiamira to his Highness, since she could be but his Slave, and that Roxelana
would always be the Sultana Queen. His Slave I answered Gianger and Axiamira
both together, surprised with so insolent a speech, that shall never be. I
should abuse your patience, if I should repeat unto you all that love, fury,
and despair, made Prince Gianger say upon this occasion; and all that sorrow
and generosity put into the Princesses mouth in so grievous an encounter: but
in conclusion they must give way to force, and obey Sarraida also had a command
to enter into a charet with Axiamira, which she did without any resistance, as
soon as she had obtained, that an only son, which she had, should not abandon
her; but contrarily, she seemed to have some consolation, out of the thought
that she was going to meet with her dear Mustapha again. As for Gianger, Rustan
told him, that he might do what he pleased, but this Prince was not in an
estate to reason upon that he had to do. It is easy for you to comprehend the
deplorable condition wherein he found himself, and what the separation was
between that Prince and the Princess. He earnestly desired her to think of her
conservation; and to comfort her in some sort, he told her, how he hoped that
Soliman could not resist her tears; that he had a great and generous soul; and
that, provided love did not prove stronger in him then reason, he was most
assured that she would remain very well satisfied of him; that in the mean time
he promised to do all things possible for her service; and that if by ill
fortune he saw things desperate, he would despair himself, and at leastwise
for the love of her, since he had not been able to live for her. A discourse so
tender drew tears from the fair eyes of the Princess, as she assured me
afterward. She reached out her hand to him in turning away her head to conceal
her weeping from him, and assured him that whatsoever Fortune could do, she
should never destroy the friendship and esteem which she had for him: That she
promised him, for a testimony that she would not be ungrateful, to think as
much of the conservation of Mustapha, as of her own, and not to attempt any
thing on her life, if nothing were attempted on her honor. This discourse had
lasted longer, if cruel Rustan, who had been busy in ordering of his men, had
not separated them, and caused the Princesses, and the little Prince to part
away, whom he placed in the midst of the thousand Archers, which had
accompanied him thither. Gianger seeing he could enterprise nothing for the
saving of the inconsolable Ax^amira, set himself at least to follow her; and
getting instantly to horse, he never lost the sight of her charet.

Now, my Lord, I have, already told you, I think, that Rustan arrived at Amasia
the next day after Mustapha and I were gone from thence; so that our voyage
having lasted a day longer then it should have done, by reason of that breaking
of the charet, whereof, if I be not mistaken, I have spoken to you before; and
Rustan having caused the Princesses to set forth two hours after his arrival;
chance, or to say better, our ill fortune, brought the matter about with so
strange a justness of time, that at the very same instant, when as I was
beseeching Soliman by the memory of the Princess Axiamira; when as I was
lamenting her untimely death, and was all in tears with the grief that I said I
was in for her loss, I saw her come in followed by Sarraida, and conducted by
Rustan, who at the very first named her to the Grand Signior. To tell you,
generous Ibrahim, what a case I was in, and that which this sight effected both
in Soliman's mind and mine, is absolutely impossible for me: the Sultan beheld
me with an eye of indignation and fury, and turning himself toward me, he said
unto me with a strong and impetuous voice; Is it in this sort then, that thou
justifiest Mustapha! but know, continued ^e, that justice shall be done to thee
as well as to him. Sarraid^, hearing her husband named, cast her self at
Soliman's feet, to protest unto him that he was innocent: but he, without
hearing or heeding her, turned about to the Princess with a little more
civility, and said unto her with a countenance that yet resented the trouble of
his soul; It was then out for Soliman that the Princess of Persia suffered
shipwreck! It was but for Soliman that she was dead! or to say better, it is
but for the happy Mustapha that she has escaped the Sea, and is living. I know
very well that the violence of the love, which I was in for her beauty, has
made me commit one against her, which seems to make me unworthy of her
affection; but the tears which I have shed for her loss, have thoroughly defaced
that crime. In the mean time, O pitiless Enemy! whilst I sigh for her death,
whilst I shed tears, and consume my self with grief, the happy Mustapha laughs
at my tears and sighs, becomes my Rival, or to say better, mine Enemy, and the
Enemy of mine Empire, in retaining a person whom I loved, or to regard the
matter with another face, in retaining the daughter of mine Enemy; in making
secret Treaties with him, and in desiring without doubt to pull me out of my
Throne, for to place you and himself there. For to think, that Mustapha has
not understood from you by what adventure you suffered shipwreck, is that which
I will never be persuaded to. To believe, that he has treated this marriage
without intending to deprive me of my Crown, is very improbable. I have such
proofs of it, as cannot be destroyed, and nothing can make me believe the
contrary.

Yet I, my Lord, must undertake to do it, said the generous Axiamira, to whom
he had still spoken in her own Tongue, and with a discourse, wherein the very
truth shall appear, make thee know, that Mustapha is not culpable, that
Sarraida is innocent, and that this maid, whom thy Highness beholds with so
much choler (said she, in speaking of me) merits extreme praise, for exposing
her self to the peril, wherein I find her, only to save me. In fine, my Lord,
I purpose to show thee, that if this tempest, which I see is risen in thy soul,
cannot be appeased without falling on the head of some one, it must be upon
mine, for that I am the only cause of the troubles of thy mind. But do not
believe, that in hearing me acknowledge this innocent crime, I have forgotten
thine, or that I am base enough to flatter thee: no, no, I still remember that
I am the Sophi's daughter, and that with a usage unworthy of my condition one
of thy Slaves carried me away by force. But whereas the preservation of them
that I love is dearer to me then mine own, I will not speak to thee in this
occasion but of those, in favor of whom Nature speaks to thee as well as I.

Rustan, fearing then lest Soliman should be moved with the tears and discourse
of Axiamira, was so audacious as to interrupt her, and demand of the Sultan,
what greater proof he would have against Mustapha, then the supposition he had
made him, in bringing him Felixa^a for Axiamira? but he would be sure, out of
the design he had to undo that deplorable Prince, not to speak a word, how he
knew, at the taking of Axiamira, that Gianger alone was in love with her. This
discourse of his repossessed Soliman's mind with anger, so that notwithstanding
Sarraida's tears, notwithstanding any reasons Axiamira could alledg, or any
supplications she could make, we no longer saw but marks of fury and jealousy
in the eyes of Soliman. He commanded guards to be set upon us, without
permitting Axiamira to undertake the justification of Mustapha: and expressly
forbad that any body should speak with us. Rustan came himself to see this
Order observed: but when we went out of the Grand Signior's Tent, to go to that
whither they were conducting us, we encountered Gianger, whom the Capigis had
not suffered to enter at such time as we were carried in. This Prince, seeing
us all in tears, approached to Axiamira; Well then, Madam, said he unto her,
what, am I to resolve of my life, have you been ill-intreated, and Mustapha is
he convicted of my crimes? Is it to the Serraglio, or to prison, that they are
leading you? In fine, acquaint me with your d^stiny, and that of my dear
brother, to the end I may regulate mine by yours, and that thereupon I may form
my designs, and take my resolutions. Rustan, who would not suffer this
conversation, neither would incense the spirit of this young Prince, before his
intentions were accomplished, for fear he should be carried to some violence,
answered him, that Soliman's anger would be appeased, that patience would
overcome him; and lest he should be offended if he came to know it, that it was
fit he should forbear speaking to Axiamira, because he had expressly forbidden
it, and that without exception. I am undone, replied Gianger, love or choler
has been the cause of this Command, and howsoever it be, I am equally unhappy.
Comfort your self, said the Princess to him, and be sure that Axiamira will
never do any thing unworthy of her birth, of her courage, and of the esteem
which you have of her: But in the mean time if it be possible endeavor to
assist Prince Mustapha.

Rustan, seeing this conversation continue still, committed the Princesses and
me to the custody of them that accompanied him; but Sarraida entreated him,
that her son might at least be restored to her; for he would not let Soliman
see him for fear he should have been moved with it: this cruel man granted her
this grace, out of the doubt he was in, lest her cries and lamentations should
have caused some tumult amongst the Soldiers if they had heard them. As for
him, he stayed with Gianger, to whom he said so many things, to pacify him,
and to make him believe, that the more patient he was, the more submission he
showed, and the more confidence he put in the goodness of Soliman, the more
would he make it appear in this occasion, as any other then Gianger would have
been deceived therewith. But he, who knew the canning of this Traitor, had not
followed his counsels, if the virtuous and prudent Achmat, who come to them at
that very time, had not counseled him the same thing, though it was with a
very d^fferent intention. He promised him to go to Soliman, for to endeavor the
appeasing of his fury; and entreated him that in the mean time he would repair
to his Tent, without permitting any body to see him; as well because he was
come to the Camp without the Emperors order, as for fear lest some violent
spirit should make him alter his resolution, assuring him that after he had
been with the Sultan, he would come and give him an account of what he had
done. Gianger would fain have spoken with his virtuous friend in private, to
have discovered unto him his love, and his brothers innocence, but it was
impossible for him. Not being able to do otherwise then, he went to Achmat's
Tent, there to attend his return, with a great deal of grief and impatience. He
saw his brother accused and in danger for the love of him, his sister in law in
prison, and his Mistress in the hands of his father and his Rival, and of a
Prince that was both the Lover and the Enemy of Axiamira. He equally feared the
hatred and the love of Soliman, and there was not any of all the passions, of
whose effects he was not afraid in this grievous encounter. As indeed they
reigned one after another in the soul of Soliman; and never was the heart of a
man tormented with such strange incertainty, as good Achmat told us afterward.
Fatherly love inspired him sometimes with clemency and pity, then suddenly the
love of Axiamira, accompanied with jealousy, brought fury, hatred, anger, and
cruelty into his heart. When he regarded Mustapha as his son, he sought to
excuse him; but as soon as he considered him as his Rival, he resolved he
should perish: Reason of State furnished him with means for that, he saw him
black all over with crimes; he had a secret commerce with the Enemies of the
Empire; he had treated with Tachmas about his marriage; he had retained his
daughter in his hands; and for a last fault, he had been so daring as to put a
counterfeit upon him. All these things nevertheless, though very strong against
Mustapha, since he believed them to be all true, could not have lost him for
all that, without Rustan's wicked counsel.

The generous Achmat did his uttermost endeavor to oppose it; he represented to
Soliman the affection which he had always born to that Prince; the brave things
he had done; the ^are qualities that were in him; the little likelihood there
was, that he would blemish so fair a life with so detestable a Treason; that
assuredly there was something concealed in this affair which could not be
comprehended; that at the least it was to be well examined, and not condemn the
lawful Successor of the Empire without hearing his Excuses or Reasons; that he
should be obliged to condemn himself by the acknowledgment of his crime; and
that far from judging him, without hearing his Justifications, he held that it
stood with the greatness and goodness of his Highness, suppose he were guilty,
to pardon him his fault, so as he confessed it with repentance; and in fine,
that in remembering he was a King, he should not forget he was a father. It was
with such like Reasons, that Achmat sought to move the heart of Soliman: but
the Traitor Rustan, without giving the Grand Signior leisure to answer, drew
venom out of all these fair flowers, and undid the unfortunate Mustapha with
the same Reasons wherewith Achmat had defended him. He answered him, that the
more Soliman had loved him, the more ungrateful he was in betraying him; that
the brave things he had done, were not so much for the good of the Empire, as
for the ruin of it, since he did not make use of the reputation he had gotten,
and of the rare qualities which were in him, but to subborn the Commanders and
Soldiers, and prepare them for a Revolt, when need should require, as Soliman
had been well advertised of it a good while before; that moreover, Mustapha did
not believe he should stain his reputation, in going about to set the Crown on
his own head, without staying till the death of the Emperor should give it him
lawfully, seeing there were domestical Examples of such like things in the
Othoman Family, which seemed to authorize it; that the lives of Kings and
Fathers had not always been sacred and inviolable to their ambitious children:
whereby this wicked man denoted, without naming him, cruel Selim, the father of
Soliman, who had made away his; to the end, that an example so fresh and
sensible might make the more impression in his Soul, and might give him a
stronger and juster fear of his son; that this affair was no way intricate to
them who had nothing else in recommendation but the Sultan's interest; that the
knowledge of the matter being so certain, Soliman was not to expose himself to
the hazard of being vanquished by the motions of Nature in seeing his son, for
fear of being vanquished a second time by him in a more dangerous manner; that
it was not necessary Mustapha should condemn himself by his own confession,
since the Laws condemned him; that clemency indeed was a great virtue, but less
needful then justice; that it was never to be made use of but toward the weak,
and the other to be always exercised against the mighty; that in the estate
wherein things were, Mustapha could not be saved without putting the Empire in
danger; that he would forget the grace which had been done him, and would ever
remember the wrongs which he would think he had received; that having acted
before out of love and ambition, he would act thence-forward out of love,
ambition, hatred, and revenge; that in fine, there was no other choice, but
either to save Mustapha and lose Soliman, or lose Mustapha and save Soliman,
which according to his sense was the juster; that the Sultan had other sons to
fill up the place of Mustapha, but that there was none that could well fill up
the place of Soliman if he were lost. Achmat rendered not himself to so
pressing a discourse; and though the maintaining of Mustapha's cause, after
that which Rustan had said, was almost to declare himself culpable, yet he did
it with earnestness, albeit to no purpose: For jealousy troubling the Judgment
of Soliman, and stifling all the motions which Nature and Virtue inspired him
with, believing withal that his son was absolutely guilty, fury transported
him in such sort, as approaching to Rustan, and speaking softly to him, he
pronounced the deadly and bloody sentence against the deplorable Prince, and
gave him order to go and see it executed.

I leave you to judge, my Lord, whether this wicked man gave Soliman any leisure
to repent him of so cruel and unjust a Commandment? or whether contrarily, he
posted not with an extreme precipitation to obey him? Achmat perceived w^ll by
his countenance, that the order which he had received was not displeasing to
him, but he did not suspect, that the matter would have gone so hastily on: so
that albeit he was in some unquietness at this proceeding, yet desired he to
make profit of his absence, and stay by Soliman. He no sooner saw himself alone
with him, but he undertook the defense of Mustapha again, when as Soliman in
choler charged him to speak no more to him of him. Whereupon Achmat would have
retired, but the Sultan commanded him to stay, and fell a walking, sometimes
very fast, sometimes more leasurely; one while he stood looking on Achmat,
without saying any thing unto him; by and by he lifted up his eyes to Heaven,
then suddenly turned them down to the ground; at last, after so violent an
agitation both of body and mind, he leaned on Achmat, and beholding him with
more marks of grief then of anger, Must I, said he unto him, after I have lived
until now, exempted from all the crimes of my Predecessors, be constrained by
Mustapha to lay a stain upon my life? and must it be said of me, that I have
dipped my hands in the blood of my son? Achmat, surprised with this discourse,
and willing to make use of so good a motion, cast himself at his feet, and said
so much unto him, that (neither his Reasons, nor the good nature of this
Prince, being any longer combated by the malice of Rustan) he told him with
tears in his eyes, that he feared he had been but two well obeyed, and that his
repentance came but too late. And then after he had confessed unto him the
Order he had given Rustan, he commanded him to go with all speed to revoke it.
But, my Lord, there was no more time for it, because as soon as Rustan had
gotten permission to exercise his cruelty, the wicked man had taken four Mutes
along with him, having each of them a Bow-string in his hand, for in that
manner it is, as you know, that the children of the Royal Family are here put
to death, and carried them to the Tent of Mustapha, from whom at the first they
had required his Scymitar, which he had given them without resistance. This
Tiger staying without the Tent with them that had accompanied him, as well to
keep any body from entering, as to hear what this miserable Prince would say in
breathing out his last, his Executioners began to attempt the accomplishing of
their charge.

When Mustapha first saw these four Mutes enter, he made no doubt but he was
lost; yet being strong and courageous, he could not resolve to suffer himself
to be strangled without some defense. The first that would have put the string
about his neck, he laid at his feet, the like he did to the second; and having
put himself in a posture that he could not be seized upon behind, he not a
little troubled his Executioners. He had already taken three of their strings
from them, and it may be he might have defended himself so long, till Achmat
might have arrived soon enough, had not the Traitor Rustan put his head into
the Tent, and by signs threatened the Mutes to do their duty. Mustapha, hearing
this voice, and knowing it, left his Executioners to go to Rustan; which was
the cause that those four men falling all upon him, overthrew him the more
easily to the ground, and put the string about his neck. This deplorable Prince
had the leisure yet to say in struggling with them (as some of them who
accompanied Rustan have reported) Do so much at least wise, thou cruel man,
that I may be the only sacrifice to app^ase the rage of Roxelana; and that my
death may obtain the lives of Gianger, Sarraida and Axiamira of Soliman. With
these last words, which interceded for another life, Mustapha lost his own;
and in his person dyed one of the greatest and most excellent Princes of the
World. The people have bruted abroad, how by a communication that was there,
from Soliman's Tent to Mustapha's, that Prince had the cruelty to excite the
Mutes to strangle his son; but very far from that, Achmat arrived within a
moment after Mustapha expired, who, as I have told you, came to change the
fatal Order, which Rustan had but two well executed. This Prince was no sooner
dead, but Rustan, as if some glory would have redounded to him by so barbarous
an act, went to render Soliman an account of it, without knowing ought of the
alteration of his mind; for Achmat had been so surprised and afflicted to find
this Prince, to whom he was bringing life, already dead, as he had not said any
thing to him of a matter, which could then serve to no purpose.

This first motion of sorrow being over, the virtuous Achmat believed that he
owed the conservation of Gianger to the memory of Mustapha; he w^nt then with
speed to him, for fear lest being acquainted with this lamentable news by
another, he should take some strange resolution. In the mean time the report of
this death being spread over the Camp, all the Janissaries came flocking to
Mustapha's Tent, where finding him d^ad, they rendered him all the testimonies
of grief, which affectionate Soldiers could render to their General. All the
Commanders did the like; there were nothing but cries and lamentations; some
threw themselves upon his body, and embracing him wet him with their tears;
others said aloud, that they must revenge his death, teer out Rustan's heart,
remove Soliman from his Throne, go and burn Roxelana in her Serraglio, and
declare Mustapha's son Emperor, though he was but a child. Some again, less
violent and seditious, threw down their arms, made a vow never to bear any, and
having thereof framed as it were a Trophy, which they erected to the virtue of
this Prince, they laid his body upon it, and abode round about it weeping the
loss they had sustained. Never was there a more general consternation seen; all
the Soldiers continued four and twenty hours without eating: and if the
prudence of Achmat had not showed it self in this occasion, Soliman's Throne
had been overturned, and his person in danger. As for us, we heard indeed a
great noise, but it was impossible for us to comprehend what it might be; and
they whom Rustan had left to guard us were so faithful unto him, as they would
not clear it unto us. We imagined with our selves, that peradventure Prince
Gianger, having made one part of the Soldiers to rise, endeavored to deliver
Mustapha, to the end he might come afterward and deliver us also; and in this
estate we were between fear and hope. In the mean while Rustan was gone back to
Soliman, who seeing him enter alone, demanded of him what Mustapha said of his
clemency. My Lord, answered he mightily surprised, Mustapha is no longer in a
condition ever to say any thing to thy Highness that may displease thee. Ah!
unfortunate that I am, and most base as thou art, continued Soliman, how
readily have thou obeyed me in a wicked action? He asked him then whether he
had not seen Achmat; and having understood that he arrived not till after the
death of the Prince, he showed such excessive grief, as the like was never
seen. Rustan amazed at so sudden a change, would have represented unto him, how
much this death assured the quiet of his Empire; but the Sultan, exceedingly
moved with choler, chased him from his presence, and forbad him for ever
appearing before him again.

In the mean time Soliman not knowing whom to make his moan to about his crime
and his misfortune, commanded Achmat to be sent for again to him. He was sought
for, and found with Prince Gianger, much busied in moderating the violence of
his grief, for he had acquainted him with the death of his brother. These two
Princes had always loved so dearly together, as never was there a more perfect
and dis-interested amity then theirs; so that it is easy to imagine the
despair Gianger was in, when he knew not only that his brother was dead of a
violent death; but that which touched his heart more nearly, that he dyed for
his sake, without being culpable of any thing, but of too much loving him. Ah!
my Lord, that I could repeat unto you all that this afflicted Prince said in so
lamentable an adventure^ but you will see but two well the resentment he had of
it, by one only action of his, without my insisting on the relation of his
discourse unto you.

Felixana, observing that Axiamira and Ibrahim had their cheeks all bedewed
with tears, as well as she, told them, that it was not time yet to shed them
all; for, Madam, said she to the Princess, you know that I have that still
resting to deliver, which is not unworthy of your sorrow, and which without
doubt will possess this illustrious Bassa with pity and grief. Whereupon she
held her peace to wipe her eyes, and to give them leisure also to do as much;
and when her sighs and theirs had had all the liberty could be required for
them, and that a sad and heavy silence had renewed their attention, she
proceeded in this sort. Achmat having received the Sultan's command for his
repair to him, thought it was fit for him to obey: He left Prince Gianger then
in the guard of five or six of his followers, with order carefully to observe
him, and not to leave him out of their sight. In going from his Tent to the
Grand Signior's he discerned the beginning of a Tumult amongst the Soldiers, he
heard not only their lamentations and their cries, but also the propositions
which they made, against Rustan, and even against the Emperor himself: So that
being come to him, and perceiving by his tears and discourse his true
repentance for his violences, he represented unto him, how it was requisite for
his safety, and for the good of the Empire, that he should show unto all his
Soldiers the sorrow he was in for the death of Mustapha; That he could not do
it better, then in taking care to preserve that which had been dear to him in
his lifetime; to which effect he was to give a place of retrent to Sarraida,
have a good regard of Axiamina, and labor to appease the grief of Gianger, who
was come with them to the Camp, and whose affliction was so great, as it was
capable of putting him into despair.

Soliman not knowing what to do in this occasion, retained Achmaet with him,
and sent to offer Gianger, by the Aga of the Janissaries, all Mustapha's
Governments. But this excel^ent Prince, abhorring the enriching of himself with
the spoils of a brother, who was dead for the love of him, generously refused
them: demanding no other portion of Soliman, said he, then the same string,
wherewith his brother was strangled. At the same instant the Sultan was
advertised, how the Soldiers, who knew not that Sarraida was in Rustan's Te^t,
thrust on by the fury that mastered them, were going to set it on fire. So that
to hinder this mischief, Soliman sent Achmat to let the Soldiers understand,
how Sarraida was in that Tent, and that in seeking to revenge Mustapha, they
were upon the point of burning his wife and his son. But to take from them an
object, which might exasperate their grief, Achmat held it convenient, not to
leave Axiamira, Sarraida, or Mustapha's son any longer in the Camp; so that
having drawn Soliman to like of it, and kept the Soldiers from off^ring any
violence to the place where we were, he came to Axiamira to assure her from
Soliman, that she should be entreated by him with the respect which was due to
her condition; and that in attending till they might advise what was fit to be
done therein, he desired her she would be pleased to suffer her self to be
conducted to Constantinople. As for Sarraida, he told her with tears in his
eyes, that the Grand Signior permitted her to choose a retreat, in what place of
his Empire she would; assuring her, that he would have as much care of
protecting her, as he had had violence in the person of Mustapha. Sarraida no
longer doubting of the death of her dear husband after this discourse, and
Axiamira being but too well assured of it as well as she, they both of them
said things, that were stronger then the consta^cy of Achmat. He wept with
these two great Princesses, and recounting to them the matter as it had past,
excusing Soliman as much as he could, he made them comprehend that Rustan wa^
the cause of all this mischief.

In the mean time Axiamira, in the midst of her affliction, demanded news of
Gianger; and after she had been assured that he lived, and that the Grand
Signior had none but good thoughts for him, she craved pardon of the
unfortunate Sarraida for having been the cause of her miseries; and made this
discourse with so much tenderness and grief, as Sarraida her self was moved
with her resentment. Mustapha's son yet further augmented the Princesses
displeasure; for albeit this child had not attained to the tenth year of his
age, he seemed to be so afflicted for the loss of his father, and said such
generous and reasonable things, as it might be said, that he would have as much
resembled him in the qualities of the mind, as in the features of the face, if
Fortune had permitted him to live. He assured Sarraida, that he would one day
revenge the death of his father; he grieved that he had not so much strength as
courage, and that he could give her nothing but tears in this occasion.

I should never have done, my Lord, if I should repeat all this conversation
unto you: but in the end Achmat having assured Axiamira, that it was not to the
Serraglio they would conduct her, and having made her apprehend, that she would
be better at Constantinople, then in the Camp; he also caused Sarraida to
promise, that she would conserve her self for her son. So that being resolved
for that which they could not avoid, the Princesses consented to their voyage,
and Sarraida chose the Town of Prusa for her retreat, not enduring to return
unto Amasia. Achmat commanded charets to be brought, appointed men for the^r
convoy, and offering his assistance to the two Princesses, Axiamira earnestly
requested him to have a care of Prince Gianger, and to assure him, that she
esteemed her self infinitely unhappy in being the cause of his misfortunes.
After this, Sarraida and she bid one anoth^r ad^e^, or to say better, they
only mingled their tears together, and with that dumb and sad language took
their eternal farewell. Sarraida was put into her charet almost in a swoon, and
Axiamira entered into that which was prepared for her, so besides her self, as I
believed she would have dyed in my arms.

In the mean space the preparation for our departure had not been made so
secretly, but that the bruit thereof was spread over the Camp: and whereas news
do change the further they go from him that first delivers them, it was noised
amongst the most part of the Soldiers, That they were conducting Axiamira to
the Serraglio; that Soliman purposed to repudiate Roxelana, and declare the
Princess Sultana Queen. In this belief they testified so much joy, by reason of
the hatred they bare to Roxelana, as being an Enemy to Mustapha, that though
she was the mother of Gianger, yet knowing how dearly he had loved his brother,
some amongst them went inconsiderately to declare this false and deadly news
unto him. He no sooner heard it, but he believed it, and losing the little
reason he had resting, he got out like a mad man, spite of them whom Achmat
had left with him: and without knowing whither he went, he found what he sought
for, that is to say, the body of Mustapha, which could not yet be drawn out of
the Soldiers hands, who had laid it, as I have already told you, upon a great
heap of their arms. As soon as Gianger approached to it, they made way for him
to pass through them; and redoubling their cries and lamentations, some of them
offered him to revenge this death, and all of them together protested that they
would have the same affection for him they had had for his brother. But he,
without harkening to their complaints, their offers, or their prayers, throws
himself upon his brothers body, wets him with his tears, then looking round
about him, as it were to seek for something, he espied a dagger amidst that
great number of arms, which he laid hold on; and then lifting up his voice,
with a more quiet countenance then before, Let some of you, O Soldiers (said
he) if the memory of Mustapha be dear unto you, declare unto Soliman, that in
giving my brother his death, he has put this steel into my hand; and let the
Princess of Persia know also, that I did not dye till I had lost the hope of
possessing her: saying this, he stabbed the dagger into his heart, no body being
able to prevent him, and fell down dead upon the body of his brother. Alas! my
Lord, I know this truth but too well; for by ill fortune, the charet wherein we
were passed so near to that place, as I saw Gianger when as he stabbed himself.
This sight, and this action then made me give a great skriek. Is there (said
the Princess unto me, who did not look that way) some more new misfortune
befallen us? Ah! Madam, said I unto her, the greatest that can happen to you in
the estate wherein you are. We heard a redoubling then of the wailings,
lamentations, and cries of the Soldiers, who making the name of Gianger to
resound all about, said so much of his death, as they had acquainted her but
too well what this misfortune was, without putting me to the trouble of telling
it her. She commanded the charet, wherein we were, to stand still; but the
confusion was so great, and the noise so dreadful, as her Order could not be
heard; besides, they that conducted us, took such care to get us speedily out
of the Camp, as I believe if they had heard what she said, they would not have
obeyed her; so that we went away in this manner, without more particularly
knowing the death of this miserable Prince: having not learnt all that I have
recounted unto you, and all that I shall tell you hereafter, till we came
hither, where the generous Achmat imparted it unto us.

It is easy, my Lord, to comprehend, what the grief of Axiamira was; That
great and generous Soul, which never fainted under her own misfortunes, found
it self then too weak, to support those of another. For though love had no
place in her heart, amity, compassion, and the obligations wherein she stood
engaged to Prince Gianger, produced the same effects in her upon this occasion.
What said she not to testify her affliction! or to say better, what did she
not that she might not survive this last mishap! she absolutely declined the
care of her preservation, she refused to eat, and I dare say, she would never
have resolved to live, if with my tears and prayers I had not conjured her not
to leave me in the hands of a Prince, which might entreat me as one culpable.
It was not because I was possessed with that fear; but seeing this Princess no
way sensible of her own conservation, I believed, that the same generosity,
which made her despise her life, to lament another misfortune, would induce
her to preserve it for the easing of mine. As indeed, after that she suffered
me to take a care of her, and without abandoning her grief, she resolved to
attend death, and not to seek it.

We in this sort arrived at this place where we are; and where afterward we
understood, that Gianger had no sooner stabbed himself to the heart with a
dagger, but the Soldiers affliction, anger, and fury redoubled far more. They
which had thrown down their Arms took them up again, maugre the vow which they
had made, and testified by their threats, that they had strange designs. It
seemed to them that they had a second time lost Mustapha in the person of
Gianger, for the love of these two Princes was so generally known, as they
regarded him as another himself. This tragique news was instantly carried to
the Sultan, who received it with so much grief, as the abundance of tears which
he shed in that occasion has almost defaced his crime; and if Achmat had not
provided for his conservation, he would peradventure have let the Soldiers gone
on in their fury, without applying any remedy unto it. But whereas he was
faithful unto him, and had no less prudence then affection, he counseled him
not to conceal his tears, to show himself to the Janissaries, and with his
presence to calm a storm, which certainly had caused some strange disorder, if
this wise servant had not dissipated it. For the matter went so far,
notwithstanding Achmat's providence, that the Soldiers who would revenge the
death of Mustapha and Gianger, seeing one part of their companions content
themselves with weeping, and not take up Arms against their Sovereign as they
did, assaulted them with such violence, as the others being constrained to
defend themselves, there was so terrible a confusion in this fight, that the
two parties could not be distinguished; and with an enraged fury they killed
one another, not knowing wherefore. Already some of them were preparing to go
to the Grand Signior's Tent, when as he caused it to be published over all the
Camp, that he deprived Rustan of all his Commands, and gave them to the
generous Achmat. This Declaration suspended the fury of the Soldiers, who
notwithstanding their despair and rage, soon quitted their Arms, to go and
gather up the money which was thrown amongst them; Achmat having caused this
largess to be given them from the Grand Signior, as it were for a recompense of
the zeal they had showed to the Princes. This present liberality made them
forget that of Mustapha; and the very same Soldiers, who would have carried
fire even to the Emperors Tent, cried, Long live the Sultan, a quarter of an
hour after, when as in person he made a turn about the Camp. He commanded the
bodies of the two Princes to be put into one Coffin, and the same being placed
in a Charet covered with black velvet, he ordained them to be carried to
Constantinople, and laid in the same tomb, which he had prepared for himself
near to the Mosque he had built. He willed also that the said Charet should be
attended upon by half of his Army, and that this funeral pomp should be
celebrated with the same magnificence, as if it had been of an Emperor that had
dyed in the Wars. As for himself, he had a purpose to have gone to Mecqua to
expiate his fault, and to pray unto God and the holy Prophet for the Souls of
the Princes: but the affairs of Persia pressing him, he contented himself with
going to Jerusalem, where he gave so many testimonies of his repentance and
grief, as it was easy to know, that this Prince had not acted by his own
inclinations.

But, my Lord, whilst Soliman gives marks of the sorrow he is in for his
violence, Roxelana repents her not of her wickedness, and far from having so
good a motion, she thinks of new cruelties. I have told you, if my memory fail
not, how Rustan was chased from Solimans Tent, but I have not told you what
became of him afterward: You must understand then how having executed that
which Roxelana had so ardently desired, he thought it was not fit for him to
expose himself inconsideratly, and that having nothing more to do there for the
service of the Sultana, he might go and render her an account of his doings. He
parted immediately then as secretly as possibly he could; but he stayed
nevertheless at the first Town he came to, where one of his servants, whom he
had given in charge about it, came and acquainted him with all that had been
done in the Camp; I mean, the revolt of the Soldiers, the death of Gianger,
Soliman's extreme repentance, the retreat which Sarraida had chosen, and
briefly all that had past there. This cruel man, fully informed of all things,
went with all speed to Roxelana, and as he related it himself, as Achmat has
told us, although she was acquainted both at one time with the death of
Gianger, and that of Mustapha, yet the loss of this last comforted her for that
other, albeit he was her own son. There remained an unquietness yet in her
mind, the blood of Mustapha had not fully satisfied her rage; she would also
have the life of his son, to the end the race of him might be utterly
abolished. So that to content this horrible desire, she told Rustan, that
knowing the power she had over the spirit of Soliman, he might believe that she
would appease his anger, and that it would be easy for her to re-establish him
in his commands; but he must first deal in such sort, as the race of Mustapha
might be quite extinguished in the person of his son. Rustan, who never found
any thing difficult, when it concerned the committing of crimes, not only
promised it to her, but executed it.

Scarcely had Sarraid^ been two months at Prusa, scarcely had she had leisure
to dry up her first tears, when as the Traitor Rustan gave her a new cause of
weeping. He went disguised to the parts about Prusa, and from thence sent to
Sarraida one of the ministers of his fury, who was his Slave, and who made show
that he was come to this excellent Princess from the Grand Signior, to assure
her of the continuance of his good will and protection. He also brought
presents to her son, as being gages of the Sultan's affection. He told her
further, that his Highness would make Mustapha revive in the person of this
young Prince; and that he commanded her to have a great care of his health and
education. This unfortunate mother, who knew by the public voice how much
Soliman seemed to repent him of his violence, suffered her self to be persuaded
that all which this wicked man said was true. In the mean time he thinks of
executing his design any way whatsoever; and seeing it was hard for him to
remove this young Prince from Sarraida, either to find means to poison him, or
to do any violence in a Town, where the memory of Mustapha was in so much
veneration, he bethought him to persuade Sarraida that she would accustom her
self to take the air, for fear lest keeping always in that sort within doors,
her melancholy should pass unto her son, and so prove prejudicial to his
health. After he had gotten this Princess to yield unto that which he desired,
he propounded to her a thing, which, very much agreeing with her sad and heavy
humor, seemed to be a very fit and pleasing entertainment for her; which was to
go and see the Grand Signior's Tombs, that were four or five miles distant from
this Town, and whose stately Mosques are to this day very carefully maintained.
Now, my Lord, that which induced this Traitor to give Sarraida this counsel,
was, that having suborned him, who was to drive her Charet, he had broken the
axletree of it, not quite through, but in such a manner, as he foresaw how upon
their arrival at a very difficult passage, which was just in the midst of the
way, that which he expected would assuredly come to pass, as indeed the matter
succeeded accordingly. In helping the Princess into her Charet, he persuaded
the young Prince to go with him on horseback, who, according to the custom of
children, was ravished with this proposition. Sarraida, out of a thought of
tenderness, or it may be out of an instinct that advertised her of her
misfortune, opposed it as much as she could; but seeing her son afflicted at
it, and that this man promised her to hold him in his arms, and to have a great
care of him, she consented to it. She was no sooner out of the Town, but this
Traitor who carried the young Prince, began to get before, and by little and
little going farther from the Charet, as if he had not done it of purpose,
Sarraida lost the sight of him.

This unfortunate Princess seeing her son no longer, began to fear without
knowing wherefore, whereupon she commanded her Charet-man to drive as fast as
he could, but whereas he was suborned, he obeyed not at first, howbeit she
threatened him in such anger, as he was constrained to do what she would have
him; but this speed was that which retarded her design the more; for the
axletree (as I have told you) being half broken, and the Charet going violently
on, it broke sooner then otherwise it would have done. Sarraida, beholding it
overturned, and no longer seeing her son, never consulted on that which she was
to do; so that abandoning her Charet, and walking on foot, followed by two
women that accompanied her, she continued in the way which she had taken, with
a trembling of her heart, and an extreme grief. And whereas she was carried by
affection, she went so fast, as but one of her women could follow her. She
arrived then near to the Grand Signior's Tombs, but alas! what was the object
which she encountered there? she beheld her son strangled, still warm, panting,
and almost in the last pangs of death. This deadly spectacle touched her in so
strange a manner, as she fell down as it were dead upon the body of her son.

In the mean time he that had driven Sarraida's Charet, being returned to the
Town, and the remorse of his crime making him to answer those from the purpose
which demanded of him where the Princess was, a great part of the Town, men and
women, went themselves to learn some news of her, so much was this virtuous
Princess beloved in that place. They found her still in a swoon, neither the
woman that served her, nor another that was come thither by chance, and had
seen the death of Mustapha's son, having been able to bring her to her self
again. The care which they altogether took about her, got her to open her eyes,
and so far to recover the use of reason, as to understand from the woman, which
she found there, with what constancy that young Prince had resolved to dye. She
recounted unto her, how going to Prusa, and feeling her self weary, she had
rested her self in one of the Niches of the Mosque, and that being fallen
asleep there, she was wakened with a noise that an horse made; that she had
seen a man holding this young child in his arms, who as soon as he was alighted
had showed him a Bow-string, and had told him that he had a Command from the
Grand Signior to put him to death; that upon this discourse the child was no
whit daunted, and said, that it was not Soliman, but Heaven that would have it
so, and that therefore there was nothing more resting for him but to obey, and
yield his neck to him, as he had done with a mavelous constancy; that for her
part, she had done what she could to hinder so horrible a fact, but it was
impossible for her; that as soon as the child was dead, his Executioner got to
horse, and fled away withal speed; that afterward she could not find in her
heart to abandon this poor unfortunate child, for fear lest some wild beast
should devour him. Sarraida, having heard this woman, first lift up her eyes to
Heaven, then casting them down on the body of her son, she suddenly closed them
up, without shedding so much as a tear, grief suffocated her in such sort, as
all that she could say was, Mustapha is dead, and his son is no longer living,
let as follow them then willingly, since there is nothing left for us to lose.
After this she never spoke more, but dyed in the same place where her son had
yielded up the ghost: so that they were both carried back to Prusa, where this
accident caused so general a mourning, and touched every one so sensibly, as
there was not any testimony of affection, or mark of honor, which they of this
Town did not render to the Corpse of Sarraida and her son, which of their own
authority they laid in the Sepulchers of the ancient Emperors, a thing without
example. The chiefest amongst them went in all haste to pursue the Murderer of
this young Prince, but he was already gotten far enough off with Rustan, who no
sooner understood that his Commandment was executed, but away he posted to
carry Roxelana the news of it, who received it with unspeakable joy.

Now whereas the Sultan was to arrive within two days, she counseled him to
conceal himself, until she had appeased his displeasure. In the mean time she
willed him so to order the matter, as it might be believed, that the death of
Mustapha's son came by the Commandment of Soliman, for fear lest he being
suspected for it, should draw the peoples hatred upon him, who would easily be
persuaded of that which they were willing should be. As indeed, the most part
were of that opinion, though it were otherwise; for that Slave of Rustan's not
^ong since confessed it on his death bed. Soliman at his return understanding
the death of Mustapha's son, testified a great deal of sorrow and anger for it;
but Roxelana accustomed to prevail over the spirit of this Prince, with her
wiles and tears, told him, that this action it may be was not too much
disadvantageous to the quiet of his Empire, for she had been informed, that
Sarraida, since her being at Prusa, had continually inspired her son with
thoughts of revenge; that all they of that Town, whenever he passed through
the streets, did nothing but wish him a longer life then his father, to the end
he might revenge his death, and mount up to a Throne which appertained unto
him; that without doubt some man zealous for his Highness had undertaken this
bold action; and therefore according to her sense the Author of it was not to
be much looked after. This discourse, which should have begot a suspicion in
the mind of Soliman, persuaded him, and was so prevalent with him, as there was
no further enquiry made of this crime, which confirmed the people in the
opinion, that it had been committed by his Order. After this, Roxelana did her
uttermost endeavor to obtain Rustan's grace, but she could not possibly do it.
In the mean time the virtuous Achmat, having understood more particularly the
extreme affection, which Prince Mustapha and Prince Gianger had born to
Axiamira, to show how dear their memory was unto him, had obtained the
permission to see her, which he has done as often as his occasions would
suffer him. And it is by him also that we have understood, how Soliman would
not since his return let any body speak to him of business, being in so deep a
melancholy, as Roxelana her self with all her artifices could not divert him
from it.

Behold, my Lord, what has been the fortune of Mustapha and Gianger, what is
the Princesses, and that which she has commanded me to tell you. It is for you
after this, continued Axiami^a, O generous Ibr^him! not only to protect me, as
you seem to be willing to do, but to counsel me also: For in the estate wherein
things are, I find my misfortune so great, as I know not what to desire. To
continue a prisoner as I am, keeps my mind in a continual unquietness, not
simply for the privation of my liberty, but out of the fear I am in, lest
Soliman's melancholy coming to cease, he should remember that he has
heretofore found something that was agreeable to him in my picture. To wish I
may return into Persia, Delimen^ will not suffer me, so that not knowing so
much as what grace to demand of you, I fear that all your address, your
generosity, and your power, cannot find a remedy to such desperate miseries. It
is certain, Madam, answered Ibrahim, that it is hard to cure them thoroughly,
but not impossible to ease them. And then he assured her, that if he had not
lost his credit with Soliman, he would obtain one thing of that great Prince,
which according to his judgment would cause her to lead a more pleasing life,
till Fortune, weary of persecuting her, would permit her to return into Persia.
The Princess, not able to believe a thing wherein she saw so little likelihood,
requested him to tell her by what means he hoped to do that which he said: but
our illustrious Bassa being loath to acquaint her with his design till he was
able to execute it, besought her to dispense with him for it, and to give him
only two days to make good his word unto her. That in the mean time she would
live assured, that whatsoever he had hitherto done at the only entreaty of
Vlama, he would do it from thence forward, out of the sole consideration of her
birth, her virtue, and her merit.

After this discourse they parted, Ibrahim leaving Axiamira and Felixana with
some consolation, and himself charged with extreme grief, to see that this
Prince, whom he so dearly loved, had been so weak, as to suffer himself to be
carried to the greatest cruelty that can be exercised, he who out of his own
inclination was one of the best Princes of the world. This thought begetting
another, the image of others misfortunes so lively represented unto him his
own, that he returned to his Palace with so much heaviness, as if some new
occasion of afflicting himself had arrived unto him, though, to speak rightly
of things, he was capable of no sorrow after that, which he had endured in
absenting himself from Isabella.

The Third Book.
THe next day Ibrahim went to the Grand Signior, and with a dextrous discourse
he gave him to understand, that he had learned what he durst not tell him. But
in imparting this to him, he let him see also, that he lamented him without
accusing him; and carrying him insensibly to speak of Axiamira, he besought him
to grant him one grace which he would demand of him in favor of her and
Felixana. Soliman gave not the Bassa leisure to explain his desire, but assured
him that he might do what he pleased for Axiamira; the repentance of his fault,
and the remembrance of his misfortune, having so absolutely extinguished the
love which he had born her, that if he would even send her back into Persia,
although she was the daughter of his Enemy, and that she might serve for the
good of his affairs, yet would he not refuse to consent unto it. My Lord,
answered Ibrahim, I pretend to no other grace for Axiamira, then to make her
change her prison, in obtaining of thy Highness, that she may be sent to
Bitilisa, and that she may be entreated as a person of her birth. And then to
oblige him the more to that which he requested of him, Ibrahim acquainted him
with the interest which Vlama had in Felixana: He made it appear unto him also,
that his in this occasion was annexed to that of Axiamira; that it was
requisite he should by his good usage of her justify himself to her, for the
violence which Rustan had offered her, in carrying her forcibly away against
his Highness will: that she would be in his power as well at Bitilisa, as at
Constantinople; but that being nearer to her Country, she would receive the
more comfort by it, and might be even the means of an advantageous peace for
his Highness.

After all these reasons, Soliman answered him, that they were needless, since
his entreaty alone sufficed to make him consent to all that he could desire;
there being but one only thing which he could never obtain of him. The Grand
Vizier, not daring to be curious in this encounter, for fear of receiving some
distaste by it, contented himself with giving Soliman thanks, and omitting no
time, he went and gave order to have a stately equipage provided for Axiamira.
And whereas he was exact in all things, he used such diligence, as the day
after all was in the state which he desired it to be. He went the next morning
to the Castle of the seven Towers, where in few words he propounded to the
Princess her going to Bitilisa, whereof Vlama was Governor, and where she
should have no straiter a prison then the walls of the Town, nor other guard
then his and Vlama's faith. He told her moreover, how in that place she should
find every one disposed to serve her, and to render her all kind of
obedience, by the order which he would give for it; that means should be settled
on her to maintain her like a person of her quality; that there she would be
far enough from Constantinople, for ever being in fear of Soliman, and near
enough to her Country, to keep correspondence with Prince Mahamed her brother,
and to procure it may be a general peace between those two great Empires. That
for his part, he promised her, to be always most careful of her interests, and
not to suffer any propositions to be accepted, which the Sophi might happen to
make for the drawing her out of Soliman's hands, unless they were such, as she
needed not be longer afraid of the violences of Deliment.

Axiamira, ravished with the generosity and prudence of Ibrahim, rendered him a
thousand thanks, and requested him to furnish her with some means, that she
might not be altogether ungrateful. You may, Madam, answered he, not only pay
me for the services which I intend to do you, but also make me beholding to you
all the days of my life, provided you will suffer your self to be persuaded,
that his Highness had never any intention to have the Princess of Persia be
carried away by force; that he has not been violent toward Mustapha his son,
but at the instigation of others; that the only defect of this Prince is only
a facility, whereof love and his gentle nature are the causes: and that in
fine, he has so many rare qualities, as he is not unworthy the esteem of the
incomparable Axiamira. The affection which you bear to this Prince, replied
she, justifies, if not all that he has done, at leastwise all his intentions.
And though he be in some sort the cause of the greatest part of my miseries,
yet I promise you, O generous Ibrahim, to give credit rather to your words,
then to mine own experience; and never to speak of this Prince, but as you
speak of him your self. I will complain of Fortune, without murmuring against
Soliman; and albeit I am resolved to weep all my lifetime for the loss of
those two illustrious children of his, yet will I not accuse any for it but the
cruel Roxelana, and the perfidious Rustan. This conversation lasted yet a good
while longer, and was spent in civility on either part. Felixana in her
particular gave Ibrahim a world of thanks, and assured him she would render
Vlama an exact account of that which he had done for her, to the end he might
help to acknowledge it in publishing it, since they could never acquit
themselves of it other-ways. Presently thereupon, the Grand Vizier took his
leave of the Princess, and told her, that she might depart the next morning, if
her health would permit her: As indeed all her equipage was ready accordingly,
but with such magnificence, as if she had been in Persia. This excellent
Princess had made her self to be so beloved of them that guarded her, as they
could not see her part without abundance of tears, though they very much
rejoiced for all that to know, that her prison should not be thence forward so
strait. But amongst the rest, Halima was so afflicted at it, as she was not to
be comforted; she gave her two Slaves, who had always waited upon her during
her imprisonment; and Axiamira, in recompense thereof, gave her a chain of
Diamonds, which she had still kept in all her misfortunes.

In the mean time Ibrahim had sent away Vlama's Slave, whom he had brought away
from the Castle of the seven Towers the day before, to advertise his Master to
repair to Bitilisa, if his strength would permit him, there to receive the
Princess. But in case he should no be able so to do, he dispatched away another
man, with a command from the Grand Signior to all the Governors of those Towns,
which were upon the road, whereby she was to pass, to render her as much honor,
as if she had been the Sultana Queen. And the Grand Vizier, to omit nothing
that might be for the Princess of Persia's safety, had also commanded five
thousand Janissaries to be her convoy, whom she found ready attending for her a
days march from Constantinople. This Princesses journey had as prosperous a
success, as Ibrahim had wished it should. She was received with a great deal of
magnificence at all the places where she passed, and without having any other
commodity then that, which the weariness of so long a way might occasion, she
arrived at Bitilisa, whither Vlama, though very weak of his hurts and sickness,
was to come to receive her, and to enjoy the sight of his de^r Felixana. When
as he was advertised of their approach to the Town, he went forth to meet the
Princess with half the Garrison; the principal inhabitants of Bitilisa received
her at the gate, and conducted her to Vlama's Palace, who out of respect had
left it to her: so as it seemed that Axiamira was the Governess of Bitilisa,
rather then that Bitilisa was the pri^on of Axiamira. It is easy to imagine
what the joy of these three illustrious persons was at this interview; but very
hard to express it well especially that which Vlama felt in finding Felixana
again living and faithful, after he had believed her to be dead, or inconstant.

But whilst Ibrahim asswages other folks sorrows, his love renders him every
day more unhappy. The more he sees Soliman, the less appearance he sees of
obtaining his liberty, which he had resolved to demand of him at his departure
from Monaco. This Prince ceased not daily telling him, that he had been dead if
he had not returned; that he was the soul of his Empire; that he could not
subsist without him; that six months absence of his had been the cause of more
misfortune to him, then he had had in all his life besides; and that in fine
not being able to live without him, he must resolve to dye with him. To all
these particulars the illustrious Bassa made no other answer then with low
submissions, but by his sighs and silence he testified sufficiently to the
Sultan, that he expressed not all his thought; and that the sight of his
Mistress had rather augmented his love, then diminished his unquietness.
Nevertheless, whereas the Grand Signior was desirous to avoid all occasions
that might constrain him to refuse Ibrahim, he made as though he did not
perceive his sadness, but endeavored to gain him absolutely, and divert him from
his melancholy, by all the honors, by all the liberalities, and all the
caresses, that a great Prince can confer on a great Minister. But the more the
Bassa saw himself obliged, the more affliction he had: He received the Sultan's
presents, as so many new chains, which tied him unto him; his favors were
torments unto him; and though in his heart he loved this Prince dearly, yet
would he not have been loved of him, so certain it is that love is stronger
then amity.

In this deplorable estate lived Ibrahim with an extreme constraint; he dealt no
longer in affairs as he was wont; he declined the world as much as he could;
yea the very sight of Soliman became insupportable to him; and not daring to
desire of him the power to return into Italy, out of the opinion he had that he
should be denied, he sought no longer for any thing but only solitude. It was
not because his grief was the less sensible to him by it, but it was because he
knew, that the liberty to bewail ones self is some kind of consolation to an
afflicted person. At length, after he had well consulted with himself, he
resolved to speak plainly to the Grand Signior, with an intent if he were
refused (as he almost made no doubt but he should) to abandon himself in such
sort to grief, as death would be constrained to succor him; but he knew not,
when he took this resolution, that he could not execute it: for as often as he
went to the Serraglio for that purpose, Soliman with so much address avoided
all manner of discourse that might carry the Bassa to speak to him of Isabella,
and always took such care to let him know the necessity he had of his presence,
as the Grand Vizier, no longer doubting, but that Soliman would deny him if he
demanded his liberty of him, undertook not to augment his displeasure yet
further, by the certainty of an evil, whereof he was already but too well
assured. He remained then without speaking, and shutting up his thoughts in his
heart, he grew to be the melancholickest man in the world. He abandoned the
care of affairs, and making to himself a prison of his Palace, he went no more
abroad, but now and then to go to the Serraglio, and that too very seldom. His
presence, which was wont to charm all Soliman's unquietnesses, now begot
nothing but grief in him; for he saw him so altered, his eyes so sunk into his
head, his face so pale, his humor so s^d, and his spirit so troubled, as he
could not behold him without extreme displeasure, but a displeasure which he
held to be so much the more just, as he knew it to be the cause of that of our
illustrious Bassa. He sought nevertheless to deceive himself, by laboring to be
persuaded, that peradventure the alteration which he saw in his dear Ibrahim,
was a malady of the body, as well as of the mind; wherefore he consulted with
a Jewish Physician, and an Arabian, about him, who, having some time observed
the Bassa without his being aware of it, judged the alteration, which was seen
in him, to proceed from some strange cause, discerning no marks or signs of a
known disease in him. His frequent sighs, the indifferency which he seemed to
have for li^e, and some interrupted words which he had spoken, when as by
Soliman's order they went to visit him, persuaded them, that the melancholy,
which appeared in him, was not an effect of his temper, but of some affliction
that troubled his mind, and which questionless was derived from some violent
passion. After so right and so well-grounded a debate, they told the Grand
Signior freely, that they could not warrant Ibrahim's life; that they were
Physicians for the diseases of the body, and not for that of the mind; that in
the estate wherein the Bassa was, he was to be his own Physician himself;
though, according to their opinion, he was in terms, rather of being the cause
of his death, then of his health; that for their parts, all they could do with
their remedies was to fortify Nature as much as they could; but at length so
long and so violent a melancholy would make an end of him, and so much the
rather for that the Bassa, to be rid of them, said, that he was not sick, and
consequently had no need of remedies.

Soliman hearing this discourse was extraordinarily grieved at it; but he could
easily app^ehend the occasion of Ibrahim's melancholy. For not seeing any
reason that he had to be afflicted, but for the absence of the person whom he
loved, he was assured that love was the cause of his heaviness. In this opinion
he dismissed his Physicians; howbeit he was no sooner alone, but accusing
himself for the loss of Ibrahim, he was almost resolved to go and ask of him
what he would have, (without considering how in this occasion, he deprived
himself of the only consolation he had, and of the only person he could love)
when as the Sultana Queen entered into his chamber, according to the privilege
which she had for it. As soon as she looked on him, she knew that he was
somewhat troubled in his mind; but whereas she was not able to discern, whether
it were an effect of choler, or of affliction, she employed all her address to
be cleared therein. Soliman had no longer that violent love for her, which had
so often blinded him, yet had she still that Empire over him, as he could never
refuse her any thing, but the grace of Rustan; so that in this occasion he
almost suffered himself to be vanquished by her. He confessed not the whole
truth unto her, but he told her, that Ibrahim's melancholy was the cause of all
his sadness; and without imparting to her, that he was a Christian under the
habit of a Turk, or of what Country he was, he told her further, that being
fallen passionately in love with a Christian Princess, whom he had seen, during
the voyage which he had made by his order; the grief of being deprived of her
presence, and of the hope of possessing her, had brought him even to deaths
door. Afterward, he declared unto her the sorrow he was in for it, and how he
would give half his Empire to save Ibrahim. My Lord, said the Sultana unto him,
if thou will accord me one grace, which I will demand of thee, I will oblige my
self to restore thy favorite to his wonted joy. I swear by Alla, replied
Soliman, to accord any thing, so as Ibrahim may be saved. My Lord, said she
unto him, I will ask of thee but till to morrow to engage my self absolutely
for the performance of that which I have propounded to thy Highness. Although
Soliman s^v^ n^ great likelihood in that which the Sultana said, yet he found
some content in not resolving so soon to be deprived of Ibrahim.

In the mean season Roxelana, without losing a minutes time, sent Rustan word,
who lay still concealed in Constantinople, to come at the beginning of the
night to one of the gates of the Serraglio, where he should find two of her
black slaves attending for him, and not to fear repairing thither, because the
Capigibassi, that kept the gate, was absolutely hers. Rustan failed not to be
present at this assignation, no more then the Slaves to receive him, and to
bring hi^^ in. When he was in her chamber, she told him, that whatsoever she
could do, it was impossible for her to obtain his grace; and that she thought
he would never obtain it, but by some very extraordinary way; that there was
one did then present it self, which she would propose unto him, to the end that
if he saw any likelihood in it, she would finish that which she had begun; and
then she recounted unto him what Soliman had said to her, and what she had
answered. But it appeared that Rustan was better informed of Ibrahim's fortune,
them she imagined; for this man, who thought of nothing but his
re-establishment, had suborned one of the Grand Visiers servants, to endevor to
find out, whether this illustrious Bassa were the cause that he was not
restored. This servant, suborned by Rustan, went often to him to give him
account of that which he learned: and the very same day that Roxelana had sent
for him, he had acquainted him, that Ibrahim was in love with a Princess of
Italy, to whom appertained a Town called Monaco; that the grief for being
absent from her had made him sick, and would cause his death, if the Grand
Signior gave him not liberty to retu^n thither to see her; that he had heard
all this through Ibrahim's chamber door, who talked thereof in private to an
Italian Slave, whom he very much loved, and whom he had comm^^ded, if he dyed
for sorrow, as he seemed not to doubt, to obtain permission of the Grand
Signior to go and execute his last Will, in carrying a Letter to the Princess
whom he loved. Rustan having acquainted Roxelana with what he knew concerning
Ibrahim, told her afterward, that if Soliman would be pleased to let him speak
with him, he did not doubt but to find a remedy for the grief of his favorite.
It is not, said Roxelana interrupting him, because his death would not be more
pleasing to me then his life; but for our interest we must do all things;
disoblige our friends if occasion require; and oblige our enemies when the
service we render them may serve for our designs. We must then, continued she,
save Ibrahim's life at this time to obtain your re-establishment; and then we
will proceed in another manner afterward, if it be offensive to us. Roxelana
then propounded unto him the demanding of an Army of Soliman to bring away this
Princess by force, whose absence caused Ibrahim's suffering: but Rustan
replied, that as long as one could work by address, no recourse was to be had
to force; that for him, he knew better how to beguile, then to fight; and in
the end, without explaining his design unto her, he promised her to perish, or
to bring this Princess to Constantinople, provided he might be furnished with a
man of war, thoroughly provided; and might be permitted to say, in the places
where he should aboard, that he was going to the King of France, in the quality
of a Chaoux, from the Grand Signior. Roxelana, seeing Rustan so resolute for
this enterprise, sent him away, and told him that the next day he should hear
from her: as indeed, she dealt in such sort with the Grand Signior, as he
promised her the grace of Rustan, if he could perform that which she propounded
to him; and this Prince resolved even to endure the sight of him, that he might
try to render his dear Ibrahim happy, without absenting him from him. At first
Rustan craved pardon of him, but when as Soliman pressed him to tell him, which
way he hoped to make his design succeed, wherewith Roxelana had already
acquainted him. My Lord, answered he, I do not think it a harder matter to
carry away a Princess of Italy by force, then a Princess of Persia; wherefore
let thy Highness be assured, that if that be given me, which the Sultana
without doubt has demanded of thee for me, and that thou will make me hope I
may re-enter into thy favor, Ibrahim shall quickly be the happiest man on the
Earth; for wanting nothing to make him so, but the possession of this Princess,
I will bring her to him ere it be long, nothing save death alone being able to
keep me from performing it. Soliman had at the beginning some aversion to this
violence, but coming to consider, that it was the only way to retain Ibrahim
with him, he forgot all other considerations. So that before he dismissed
Rustan, he was absolutely resolved to attempt the matter, and therefore he
assured him that he should depart within two days: but in the mean time he
charged him to entreat the Princess of Monaco, who was she that he was to bring
away, with the same respect as he was obliged to have for the Sultana Queen.

Things being in these terms, the Grand Signior caused all Rustan's equipage to
be made ready, with all the diligence that possibly could be; he furnished him
likewise with great store of money and jewels, in case he should have need of
it; he had also his dispatch, as if indeed he had been sent to the King of
France, in the quality of a Chaoux: and lacking nothing else for his voyage, he
set sail in as favorable a season as might be. This happy beginning of
Navigation gave no false hopes to the Pilot, who made such use of the advantage
of the wind and fair weather, as, his vessel being an excellent sailer, he made
this cut with a speed, the like whereof has not been heard speak of in all the
seas of the Levant. Rustan approaching to Monaco, sent his skiff with one of
his servants, and an interpreter, to demand permission of the Princess for his
entrance into the Port, there to mend his vessel, which he said was bruised
with the fury of the Sea, and he had caused one mast and some of the tackle
thereof to be really broken, to the end, if what he desired were not granted,
he might have a pretext to stay in that place, and so might be able to seek out
some means for the executing of his design. But it happened that the Princess,
having been constrained to go to Genoua for some important reasons, which had
obliged her thereunto, was not then at Monaco: so that he, who commanded in her
absence, answered Rustan's messenger, that the Princess at her departure had
given him order, to let no man of war enter into the Port, as long as she was
not there.

Rustan understanding by the return of his skiff that this Princess was not at
Monaco, seemed at first to be much afflicted at it; but suddenly being of
another mind, he thought on the contrary that it would be advantageous to him,
since she being questionless to return from Genoua to Monaco, it would be
easier for him to carry her away at sea, then out of a Town. He resolved then
to go to Genoua, and show the State his dispatch, to the end he might be the
better received by them, and might make his abode there till the Princess
should depart from thence to Monaco, under color that he waited for one of his
ships, which he would say was severed from him by a Tempest. The matter being
thus resolved, he executed it accordingly; and taking into the main Sea again,
to the end he might be seen to come from the Levant, he sailed to Genoua, where
he was received, not only as the Grand Signior's Chaoux, as soon as he had
showed his dispatch, but as one sent from a Prince, to whom the Republique had
a great obligation. In the mean time he dexterously enquired after the place
where the Princess of Monaco's Palace was; and having learnt it out, he made
one of his Slaves watch always in the same street to discover, whether any
preparations were a making thereabout for a Voyage. He caused some to observe
at the Port, whether any Galley were ready to set forth, and all to be informed
when she went; In conclusion, he omitted nothing that might serve for his
design. He was certain days in this expectation with a great deal of
impatience; but Fortune, that would not yet abandon him, furnished him with a
far more favorable occasion to carry away the Princess, then that which he
attended.

One night, when as he was in his Vessel, which notwithstanding the entreaties
of the Senate he would never abandon, after he had heard a dreadful noise of
armed men, both at the Port, and in the City, he was advertised by those whom
he had sent thither, that all was in confusion there; that the gates were all
open; that the Port was no longer closed; and that in this disorder, it could
not be comprehended who were the enemies. Rustan making profit of this
occasion, and others misfortunes, leaves one part of his Soldiers in his
V^ssel, and followed by the other goes directly to the Princess of Monaco's
Palace, sets a Petard to the gate, blows it up, enters in with his Forces, and
conducted to Isabella's lodging by the voices of her women, who called all the
servants of the house to their succor, he forces it, and finds the Princess,
who first presented her self, believing she should meet with people that could
understand her language, and be moved with her prayers: But she was much
amazed, when she saw they were Turks; whereupon she gave a great skreek, and
stepping three or four paces back, she would have fled into a Cabinet, but
Rustan, who perceived it, retained her, and put her into the hands of his
Soldiers, no way doubting but it was the Princess, as well by reason of her
good aspect, as of the eagerness which all her women and all her servants
showed in opposing her carrying away. Nevertheless fearing he might be
mistaken, he caused Emilia, whom he saw to be more richly apparelled then the
rest, to be likewise carried away; for although it was night, yet had all the
women of Genoua their clothes on, being risen out of their beds upon the
fearful noise they had heard in the City. And then again it was easy for them
to carry away Emilia, who seeing the Princess born away, did only cry out in
the streets as they went along to oblige some to succor them: As indeed there
were those, who knowing her voice would have withstood this rape, but it was in
vain; for Rustan making use both of the valor of his men, of the disorder of
the City, and of the darkness of the night, caused these two fair afflicted
ones to enter into his Vessel, which had been made ready whilst he was gone to
this Execution; and from thence into Doria's Galley, whereof the Turkish Slaves
had rendered themselves Masters: so that he was no sooner aboard it, but
causing them presently to weigh Anchor, he made out of the Port, and shaped his
course for Constantinople.

In the mean time Ibrahim still languished, and his grief made him lead so sad
and wearisom a life, as the thought of death was the most pleasing to him of
any other. Soliman, for his p^rt, was in so extreme a melancholy, to see his
dear Ibrahim suffer so many miseries for the love of him, and the respect which
he showed to him, in not demanding his liberty of him, redoubled his gri^f far
more: nevertheless, how violent soever it was, the desire he had to retain this
illustrious Bassa still with him, was yet more powerful. The hope of Rustan's
return did many times diminish his displeasure, but the incertainty thereof
permitted him not to be long without unquietness; which augmented much more,
when as the Term, which he had imagined in his mind for the execution of this
enterprise, was arrived. He believed that Rustan h^d suffered Shipwreck; or
that his design had been discovered; or that he had been killed; or at
leastwise retained a Prisoner. He saw that the grand Visiers grief abated not;
and that the remedy would arrive too late, if the succoring of him was never so
little retarded. He had oftentimes a desire to discover Rustan's Voyage unto
him; but the fear of aggravating his d spleasure, in stead of moderating it,
straightway restrained him from it. He knew very w^ll, that Ibrahim could not
choose but rejoice at the sight of Isabella; but he with reason feared, that he
would be infinitely afflicted to know that violence should be offered to the
person he so loved; and that she should be exposed to all the dangers of the
Sea. So as all that Soliman could do was to bewail him, and to go and see him
sometimes against the custom of the Grand Signiors, who seldom visit their
subjects. These visits gave no great satisfaction, either to him that received
them, or to him that rendered them. Ibrahim's melancholy redoubled by seeing
that which Soliman showed in his countenance; and Soliman's grew the greater by
observing in his Ibrahim's face all the signs of an extreme grief: Yet would he
for all that constrain himself sometimes; he thanked Soliman for his goodness
to him; and assures him, that if he could lose his life in serving him, he
should dye with some consolation. Soliman, feeling himself pierced with grief
by so kind a discourse, could not endure the continuance of it, but was
constrained to quit him, after he had conjured him to live for his sake.

The unquietness and fear which Soliman was in of losing the Grand Vizier, took
him up in such sort, as though the affairs of Persia were extreme pressing, yet
could he not resolve to frame any design, contenting him only with giving
Vlama order to oppose the Enemy as much as he could, if he attempted any thing;
but not to enterprise ought against him, until he had a new order from him.
This commandment no whit displeased Vlama; for albeit he was one of the
valiantest men of his age, yet was he very glad that the War did not keep him
from abiding some time with Axiamira and Felixana. The Enemy himself
contributed also to his design; for though he had gotten the advantage in the
last occasions, yet was he a long time without undertaking any thing. That
which caused this suspension of Arms was the news, which was brought to the
Sophi's Court, how Axiamira and Felixana were in the hands of Soliman, who
retained them prisoners. This last circumstance exceedingly troubled the Sophi
and Deliment: they did not wonder, to know certainly that they were not dead,
as all the world had believed them to be; not to understand that they were in
Turkis, because they aforetime suspected that Vlama had carried them away; but
to see him General of the Grand Signior's Army in Ibrahim's absence, and to
hear at the same instant that his Mistress was a Prisoner, was a matter which
they could not comprehend. They resolved nevertheless to endevor to be cleared
therein, by the means of those secret intelligences, which all great Princes
have in their neighbors Courts; and in the mean time to make great preparations
for war, that they might serve their turns of them according to occasion.
Mahamed, who was acquainted with this news better then they, testified a great
deal of joy for it; It was not because he was not sorry to know that Axiamira
and Felixana were in prison, but having believed them to be dead, or in the
power of Tachmas and Deliment, he was ravished to understand that they were
living, and out of their tyranny; not being able to imagine that two persons of
that importance could be ill entreated in a place, where Vlama was so powerful.
Mahamed was not he alone, who was glad to know that Axiamira was not dead, for
this Princess was so generally beloved throughout that Empire, as this news
being spread amongst the people, every one gave such marks of an unspeakable
rejoicing, as if a memorable victory had been obtained over the Enemy. All the
women of quality of the City of Sultania, where Tachmas was resident, when as
he received this advice, sent humbly to beseech him, if there needed a ransom
for the redemption of the Princess, that he would be pleased to let all their
jewels serve for a part of it; esteeming themselves more then happy, if with
the loss of their liberty they could buy out the Princesses. This generous mark
of affection, which they bore to Axiamira, was not received as it deserved: for
the subtle Perca, who was mad to see that her sister left not to reign in
Persia, though she was a prisoner at Constantinople, persuaded Tachmas, that
this extreme affection, which the people carried to the Princess, might cause
great mischiefs in the continuance of the war; that the imprisonment of
Axiamira was without doubt an artifice to deceive him; that it was without all
likelihood that Vlama should be in good terms with Soliman, and Felixana be ill
entreated; that there was somewhat in it, which was not apprehended; that it
was to be feared, lest whilst Axiamira seemed to be in prison, she had not
some intelligences in the Country; that if it were so, and that some one should
be so daring as to rise, the name of Axiamira might quickly draw the people to
her party; and that finally it was fit to let them know in good time, that this
rejoicing was criminal; yea and that Axiamira was to be declared guilty of high
treason, for withdrawing her self out of his dominions. She added further to
this, that to extinguish the ardent love which the people bare the Princess,
she was to be taken by her own interest, in publ^shing every where, that she
was the cause of the war, and consequently the cause of the ruin of the whole
Empire; that she alone had made Vlama revolt; and that she alone had drawn
Soliman to take up Arms: so that there needed no ransom to redeem her, but a
puissant Army to pluck her out of the Sultan's hands, and make an example of
her to posterity. Tachmas, having heard Perca's discourse, told her, that he
saw a great deal of probability in that which she said; and that he was
resolved to deal after that manner; but that should not keep him from doing
what he could to draw home Axiamira and Felixana, by the means of an
Ambassador; that it was for the dignity of the Empire to proceed in that sort;
and for a wise Politician always to lay the blame on the Enemy. Deliment being
arrived at the end of this conversation, confirmed Tachmas yet more in his
design; having been advertised by a Governor of one of the frontire Towns, that
Axiamira was no ^onger a prisoner at Constantinople; that she had been
conducted to Bitilisa with a most magnificent Train; and that she had been
received there by Vlama, with all the marks of honor that could have been
rendered her in Persia. This last news touched the Sophi sensibly; when he had
understood that Felixana was a prisoner, he had at least had the consolation to
hope that Vlama should not see her no more then he; but hearing that she was in
a Town, whereof he was Governor, jealousy transported him in such sort, as he
scarcely knew what he said. For Deliment, whereas he could not be jealous, the
despite to see himself contemned, and the rage he was in for that he could not
possess Axiamira, excited as much trouble in his soul, as jealousy did in the
Sophi's.

As for the ambitious Perca, the only desire that she had to reign made her to
move; and that she might rise to that supreme greatness, she thought there was
but two things wanting ^o her; the death of Deliment, and the peoples hatred to
Axiamira. For touching Ismael and Mahamed, she did not believe that the
stupidity of the one, and the blindness of the other, would permit them to
oppose her. So that to execute her intention, she persuaded Deliment, that he
was at this time to hazard all things; that it was not for his honor, to know
Axiamira was so near the frontire, and not do his uttermost to draw her out of
Vlama's hands: And for Tachmas, she made him do that which by her counsel he
had resolved upon. He said before all his Court, that he took it very ill, such
joy should be testified upon notice had that his daughter was in the power of
his Enemy; that the belief of her death had touched him less, then the news he
had received that she lived in that manner; and then he publicly declared her
guilty of high Treason, aggravating all that Perca had said to him. But though
this Manifest had some appearance of truth, yet found it no credit, either with
the Grandees, or the people. The violences of Deliment, the wickedness of
Perca, and the virtue of Axiamira, were too well known to have the matter
succeed, as Tachmas hoped it would. And the people, on the contrary, seeing so
great marks of animosity in a father against his daughter, in a sister against
her sister, were ready to rebel, and be carried to some strange resolution.

In the mean time Deliment thinks of levying of Troops, and making up so mighty
an Army, as, vanquisher or vanquished, it should absolutely decide the fortune
of this war; being resolved to dye, or to return with Axiamira. Tachmas on his
side, following his resolution, dispatches an Ambassador to the Grand Signior,
to demand his daughter, and Felixana of him; offering two millions for their
ransom, though by law he believed not himself obliged to give any thing for two
persons, that were not prisoners of war. He sent away diverse spies at the same
instant to Bitilisa, to learn what past there; but all of them reported, that
the Princess and Felixana seemed to be absolutely at liberty; that Vlama
rendered them all imaginable civilities; and what care soever they took therein,
they could not discover for what reason the Princess had been conducted to
Bitilisa; the people saying no other thing, but that it was believed she was
come near unto Persia to make propositions of Peace. A few days after, a
Messenger sent by Axiamira came and brought him a Letter from this Princess,
who not doubting but that the Sophi had heard where she was, thought it was fit
for her to write unto him, to the end she might not be wanting in that duty
which she owed him, as being her father. When he received this Letter, Perca
and Deliment were there present, who would have obliged him not to have read
it, for fear lest he should have been moved therewith, but they could not
prevail with him; for this Prince, provoked more by curiosity, or the thought
that he should find something in it which regarded Felixana, then by any
kindness, opened it, and reading it aloud, he saw that was thus.

AXIAMIRA's Letter to the SOPHI her Father.
My Lord,
IF I had gone out of your Dominions of mine own accord, I should think my self
obliged to ask you pardon for it; but since my flight is a crime of Fortune,
and that I have no other part in it then the suffering of the evils which she
has made me endure; I believe that without charging my self with a fault,
which I have not committed, it will suffice that I most humbly beseech you not
to take it ill, if I dare say to you, that I have some consolation in my
misfortunes, to see that my Prison is a Refuge for me against the violences of
Deliment, and that not able to be free with you, I am at leastwise absent from
you, without being culpable of it. But, my Lord, I am but too much, in having
contrary thoughts to yours; I know it certainly, and yet whatsoever I do, it is
impossible for me to cease from being faulty in this sort; for methinks Reason
makes it appear to me, that I have no aversion for Deliment, but because he
stains your glory, abuses your goodness, thinks of nothing but contenting his
ambition, is an enemy to virtue, and in conclusion I wish him no ill but for
the love of you. But, my Lord, I am almost confident, that every word I write
is a crime; that in thinking to excuse my self, I become the more culpable; and
that in seeking to justify my cause, I sign my condemnation. Permit then that
my death or banishment may be the punishment of this fault, and that I may
beseech you to believe, that the former would be sweet unto me, if I could hope
to be lamented of you; and that the other would be insupportable to me, if
there were not some hope remaining for me, that you will one day consent, that
Axiamira may live with you, and not be constrained to be the wife of Deliment.
It is that which is hoped for, and implored of you,

My Lord, By your most humble, most obedient, and most faithful Subject,
Daughter, and Servant, AXIAMIRA.


The reading of this Letter touched the Sophi in a diverse manner; he felt
tenderness, confusion, and anger; and it may be if he had been alone, Nature
and Reason had prevailed so powerfully for Axiamira, as she had carried away
the victory from her enemies; but the counsels of Perca, and the speeches of
Deliment, wrought a clean contrary effect in him. Perca told him, that it was
too daring a part in her to be so bold, as to write such things to him of a man
whom he loved; that without doubt Axiamira spoke not thus, but because she was
well assured, that whatsoever ransom was offered, she should never be remitted
into his power; that he was to testify a great deal of resentment for this
insolent proceeding, and to entreat him ill whom the Princess had sent, who
questionless was come to Prince Mahamed, or as a Spy, rather then to bring him
this Letter, which could not serve Axiamira for ought, whether she remained in
the Grand Signior's Dominions, or whether she returned into his Empire.
Deliment seeing the Sophi sufficiently incensed, took a different way from that
which Perca had held, which yet produced the same effect. He besought the
Sophi, with a false generosity, to permit him to withdraw himself from affairs,
and from about him, for the contenting of Axiamira. But the Sophi, as Deliment
had rightly forecast it, forbad him the further prosecuting of this discourse,
his anger redoubling so much the more by this artifice. And for a conclusion,
he called the party before him, who had brought him the Letter from Axiamira,
charged him never to come within his Dominions again, and told him, that if he
had not pu^^sed to have him carry back his Commands, he would have had him
severely punished. Then he willed him to say unto her that had sent him (for he
would not call her the Princess, his Daughter^ or Axiamira) that he had no
other answer to make her, but that if the ransom, which ^e had sent to offer
for her, did not bring her back into Persia, he would go and fetch her in the
head of an hundred thousand men; and that in the view of so mighty an Army, he
would deal with her as Soliman had done with Mustapha.

After this cruel answer, the Sophi commanded this man to be searched, to see
whether he had any Letters about him for Mahamed, or his Governor: this search
was not vain; they found one for the Prince, wherein what care soever Axiamira
had taken that it should not prejudice him if it were met withal, yet had she
not sufficiently concealed the extreme affection which was between them, and
the intelligence they had held together, when she was at Amasia. So that as
soon as it was read, it was resolved, for fear Mahamed should receive others by
some more secret way, to have two things done. The first, to change all his
House, to the end that having none that he could trust about him, he might not
receive any news from Axiamira. And the second, to secure his person, lest some
abroad should attempt that which was doubted from them. This design being
resolved, was quickly executed. Deliment, according to his wonted insolency,
went himself to command the blind Prince from the Sophi not to stir out of his
lodging, and to charge both his Governor and all his servants to be gone from
him: That done, he placed a Guard about him, and left this Prince in an
affliction, the like whereof he had never felt before. All that came near him
were his Enemies Agents, and whether he would or no he was enforced to let them
wait upon him. This detention made a great noise in the Sophi's Court, even the
people themselves were diverse times about to rise; but amongst the rest the
Princes domestic servants could not endure this violence. And indeed,
Mahamed's Governor, having assembled the chiefest of them together, propounded
unto them the enterprising of carrying away the Prince their Master to
Bitilisa. He told them, that it was better to put him into the hands of a
courteous enemy, as Soliman was to Axiamira, then to leave him in the power of
a cruel and incensed father; that as for them, if they continued at Sultania,
they would not be in safety, but upon the least suspicion that one should have
of them they would be severely punished; so that as well for the conservation
of the Prince, as for their own, they were to undertake the delivery of him.
They all answered him with a great deal of zeal and affection, that they were
ready to expose their lives for the Prince their Master; but that they did not
think they could commodiously do it for him. Whereupon this wise Governor told
them, how he knew certainly that those which guarded him, relying on his
blindness, were not very exact in keeping him; that it being so, the matter
would not be very difficult, because the Prince lay in a low chamber, that
jetted upon the Palace garden, whereof the walls were not very high; that the
only difficulty was to advertise him not to make any noise, at such time as he
should hear his chamber window opened; which indeed would not be very easy to
do, by reason the Prince could neither read that which should be written to
him, nor see the signs that might be made him, so that he concluded something
was to be left to chance; that for so much as concerned their getting out of
the City, the Governor thereof was resolved to follow the fortune of Axiamira,
and to abandon a Government, which he knew well would be taken from him in a
short time, by reason of the great affection he had testified to this Princess,
and that so it would be easy for them to escape. This Proposition being
approved of by all, they thought of nothing else but of executing it. And
whereas the nights were very dark, in regard the Moon did not shine, they
deferred it no further.

The Governor of Sultania, whom Mahamed had formerly gained, chose amongst his
Soldiers those whom he believed were most faithful to him, and without any
notice taken of it, he placed them at one of the gates of the City, through
which he meant to pass. Night being come, all Mahameds deliverers met together
at a Randezvouz appointed by them; they brought l^dders to enter into the
garden, whereof the walls were but low, as I have already observed. For whereas
Sultania was not the residence of the Sophi, they had not since the loss of
Tauris, is yet erected any magnificent buildings there. This generous Troop,
passing between two Sen^inels, got into the garden without any obstacle, went
directly to Mahamed's lodging, opened one of the windows of it, without
awakening him; or any of his guard who lay in his antichamber; and then he
whose voice they thought he best knew, entered into his chamber with his drawn
Scymitar in his hand, approached to his bed after he had sought for it a while,
and though he wakened him very softly, yet could he not so speak to him; but
that he gave a a great skreek, and demanded with much resolution, whether
Deliment ha^ sent to kill him. Mahamed spoke so loud, that some of his guard
awaked, and made a noise amongst themselves; but the Prince coming to know his
voice that spoke to him, and whom he was assured was very faithful to him, held
his peace, and by his silence made them of the guard who were ^wake, hearing
nothing any longer, to get them again to sleep, believing that Mahamed had had
some troublesome dream, which had caused him to speak so loud; being not much
careful besides in guarding him, because they had order only to keep any from
speaking with him, and bringing him Letters.

In the mean time Mahamed having understood in few words, in what manner they
would deliver him, suffered himself to be conducted by him that spoke to him.
All this Troop received him with exceeding joy; but fearing lest they should be
troubled with some cross encounter, as soon as they had put clothes upon him,
which they had brought purposely along with them, they went out of the garden,
and presently after forth of the City. About an hundred paces from the gate
they found horses, which the Governor of Sultania had caused to be there ready
provided, and getting upon them, they rode away with all the speed that
possibly they could make. But whereas the Prince could not guide his horse, but
was constrained to let him be lead by another, they could not go so fast, but
that the second day of their journey they espied a Troop of Horse posting after
them, which, being far more in number then they, made them believe, not only
that they were pursued, but that they were all lost; nevertheless they resolved
to sell their lives dearly. The Prince too, as blind as he was, caused a
Scymitar to be given him, and to the end, that if they fought, he might not
strike his friends in stead of his foes, he commanded his followers not to come
near him without calling him by his name; and whereas his eyes did not serve
him to assault any, he resolved to abide in one place, with an intention not to
suffer himself to be taken alive. But whatsoever he could do, his people placed
him in the midst of them, much against his will, being resolved to dye or to
save him. In the mean time the Troop, which they believed to be their enemies,
came still on, and every one was already preparing for defense, when as the son
of the Sa^rap of Mesapotamiae, an enemy to Deliment, advancing foremost, and
throwing his Scymitar to the ground, to let them know that he would not fight
with them, made them change their resolution of defending themselves, into
embracing them. Prince Mahamed understanding who he was, and knowing him by his
voice, caressed him exceedingly, and learnt of him, that it was long before his
flight was known; because his guard, not having been accustomed to enter into
his chamber but when he called them, had waited till noon without going in;
that the matter being discovered, Tachmas at the first showed a great deal of
fury; that Perca had done nothing but laugh at it, and in a bitter jeering
manner had wished, that Soliman would make him General of his Army, to the end
that a man who saw so clear, might choose out the most advantageous places for
the encamping of his Troops; that for Deliment, whereas he hated his father, he
accused him for having been privy to his escape; and that having been
ill-intreated by the Sophi he was retired from the Court, and had commanded him
to come and offer him whatsoever lay in his power, not doubting but he had
taken the resolution to repair to the place where Axiamira had already found a
sanctuary; that in the mean time it was requisite for them to make away with
all speed, in regard it might be that Tachmas had altered his determination,
and would resolve to have them pursued. Prince Mahamed desired further to know
of him who they were that accompanied him, which proved to be the worthiest men
of the Court. The Prince made very much of them; and that he might not hazard
persons to whom he was so much obliged, he sent one of his servants before to
Bitilisa, to know of Axiamira, whether the place of her retreat would not be a
safe one for them. This while they rode on as fast as possibly they could: but
when they were come to the uttermost part of the frontire, they stayed to hear
some news from him whom they had sent to Bitilisa. Vlama came and brought it
them himself; and this excellent man received Prince Mahamed with so many
testimonies of joy on either side, as they were a long time before they could
separate themselves, or resolve to march forward. All the rest came afterward
to salute Vlama, who assured them all of his service and protection. Mahamed as
they rode along enquired after Axiamira's health, but he durst not ask him any
thing of Felixana, for fear left he should take that care for an effect of his
ancient love. And when as Vlama perceived so much, I thought, my Lord, said he
unto him, that after I had assured you how Axiamira was in the estate you
desired her to be, you would have demanded of me how Felixana did, since having
heretofore judged her worthy of your affection, I might well think you would
render her that proof of your good will. My dear friend, replied Mahamed
smiling, I durst not put my Protector in mind that I had been his Rival; and
though the memory of Felixana be infinitely dear to me, that which I owe to
your friendship kept me from rendering her publicly, what I will ever render
her in my heart: Let not this discourse disquiet you, continued Mahamed, for in
acknowledging that I shall always be in love with the virtue of this discreet
maid, I protest to you withal, that this love shall never beget any other
desire in my Soul, then to see her contented, that is to wish she may be
Vlama's wife. My Lord, answered he, Felixana is far more dangerous, and more to
be feared then she was, when as she surmounted your heart; she has charms and
beauties, which you know not, and which peradventure will make you change your
resolution. You are but too well assured, replied Mahamed, that I am a bad Judge
of beauty, and that love enters not into my heart by the eye. Neither do I
mean, continued Vlama, that visible beauty which renders Felixana the object of
the admiration, as well of stupid, as of witty, of vicious, as of virtuous
persons; but I mean that beauty, which is wholly celestial; which never makes
any but noble Conquests; which touches none but great and generous Souls; and
which, not destroyed by time, begets another love, that lasts eternally. In
fine, my Lord, that which I mean is the beauty of the mind and soul of
Felixana: When she captived you, she had wherewithal to make one believe that
her thoughts were generous; ambition did not move her, and the desire to be a
Queen made her not forget what ^^e had promised. But, my Lord, Felixana has
done much more, for she has despised death for Axiamira, she has exposed her
self for her, and this rare maid has testified so much constancy and
generosity in diverse encounters, as it will be hard for you not to love her,
when you shall understand it. I shall love her without doubt, replied Mahamed,
but the more worth and virtue I shall know in her, the more shall I be obliged
thereunto; and the more shall I be confirmed in the resolution, wherein I have
a long time been, not to esteem my self happy, but when Vlama shall be so; nor
to pretend to any thing from Felixana, but that which she cannot deny me
without a crime, that is to say, her friendship. Believe, my Lord, answered
Vlama, if there needs nothing but that to content you, you have cause to be
satisfied; for I certainly know, that it would be a hard thing to judge rightly,
who carries more affection to you, either Axiamira, Felixana, or my self. And
be assured if you please, my Lord, that all which I have said to you has been
but to have the pleasure to speak of Felixana; it being most certain, that I
honor her at this present so highly, and that she has rendered the love which I
bear her so perfect, as jealousy can never have any place in my Soul.

With such like discourses Mahamed and Vlama, without being heard of any but
him that guided the Prince, beguiled the time; whilst the rest entertained
themselves with the weakness of Tachmas in suffering himself to be governed in
that manner, with the malice of Perca, the stupidity of Ismael, and the
universal hatred that Deliment had drawn upon him. But at length after they had
traveled a day and an half, this Troop arrived at and Bitilisa. Axiamira and
Felixana were exceeding joyful to see Prince Mahamed, who not able to enjoy the
same felicity, was nevertheless charmed to hear them speak. Felixana, who loved
the Prince as much as if he had been her brother, durst not testify so much
unto him; but Vlama, being as dexterously to discover her thoughts, as he had
been in discerning those of the Prince, approached to her, and told her
laughing, that he had made certain conditions with Mahamed, which he conjured
her she should observe. Two such sage persons, answered she, could not resolve
on any thing which is not just, wherefore I think that I shall not engage my
self inconsiderately, when as I shall promise you not to break them. Vlama then
told her in few words what had past between the Prince and him, and Felixana
promised to do that he desired; whereupon he left her to go and give order for
the commodious lodging of all this Troop. The Princess would needs see all them
that came along with the Prince; and with her sweet carriage and address so
absolutely gained them, as they would have enterprized any thing for her
service. Whilst she was complementing, and Vlama giving direction in the Town,
Felixana came to Mahamed, and such was their conservation together, as it knit
their friendship fast for all their lives after. He requested her she would
permit him to be Vlama's confident, and would forget the misfortunes which his
love had been the cause of to her; he thanked her for the services she had
rendered to the Princess Axiamira; promised always to honor her more then any
person in the world; and without speaking to her of love, he gave her to
understand, that if reason had not prevailed over his inclination, he had still
been Vlama's Rival; but it was of that power in his Soul, as he never spoke a
word to Felixana, contrary to the promise he had made her, to love her no
otherwise then as his sister.

In the mean time Vlama, after he had lodged the Prince in the Castle, the rest
in the most commodious houses of the Town, and given order for the entreating
of them honorably, dispatched away a man to advertise the Grand Signior of that
which had past, and to beseech him he would permit that Bitilisa might be a
prison for Mahamed, as well as it was for Axiamira; undertaking to bring him
his head, if this Prince, or any of them that followed him, enterprized ought
against his service. But Soliman was not in an estate of thinking on the
affairs of his Empire; and the Grand Visiers melancholy was the only thing
that took up his mind. The Persian Ambassador was come to Constantinople, and
had oftentimes demanded audience, but could not obtain it. The Sultan spent the
most of his time at Ibrahim's Palace; and though this illustrious Bassa was
extreme weak, yet walked he sometimes with the Grand Signior in his garden. It
happened then that one morning Soliman came to visit him earlier then he had
used to do, and having made him pass insensibly into his great chamber, leaning
on a Cane garnished with gold, which he most commonly went with when he was in
health, he would needs have him walk down, to the end, said he unto him, he
might fortify himself the better by taking the air. Ibrahim, who sought not
the preservation of his health, did not obey the Sultan, for the reason
alleged by him, to persuade him to walk down; but contrarily he did it, out of
the belief he was in, that his weakness being exceeding great, the more he
should put himself into agitation, the more would his forces diminish, and the
nearer he should be to his grave. With such different designs did the Sultan
and the Bassa descend into the Court; and the Grand Signior, seeming as though
he would not have the Bassa make too long a walk at a time, caused him to lean
on the balustrade, that divided the Courtyard of his Palace, there to rest
himself with him. Scarcely had they been there a quarter of an hour, when as
they saw an hundred Janissaries enter, attired all in cloth of gold, who ranked
themselves in order on both sides. The Grand Vizier surprised with this pomp,
demanded of Soliman what it might be? but he told him smiling, that he must
behold the end of this ceremony, before he could be cleared therein. The Bassa
then saw the Aga of the Janissaries enter, who marched alone gorgeously
appareled; He was followed by the high Treasurer, whom the Turks call
Testardar, accompanied with an hundred Slaves, carrying two and two great
maunds of silver, all full of the richest ornaments that the women of the
Levant do use. In some of them were little hats, set all over with precious
stones; chopines garnished with Turkeyses and Rubies; smocks embroidered with
gold and pearl; most sumptuous gowns, which being laid confusedly together,
made a pleasing mixture, of curled cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, and of
velvet, whose ground was gold. The last maund was not open on the sides like
the rest, and appeared to be full of all sorts of jewels, of so excessive a
value, as there were three or four hundred thousand crowns worth of pearls
amongst them. They which carried these precious presents ranked themselves all
along the balustrade, where the Sultan and Ibrahim were leaning. After this
entered twelve charets full of young virgin Slaves, richly clothed, each of them
drawn by six white horses, and driven by two Eunuchs. Then followed thirty
other virgins, apparelled in cloth of gold, accompanied with so many black
Slaves, having all of them chains and collars of massive gold: These Slaves
being placed on their knees where the Aga of the Janissaries appointed them,
there entered next two hundred Mules laden with hangings of cloth of gold, of
satin, of velvet, the ground silver; with cushions embroidered all over, which
are the seats of that Country; and with a great deal of the most sumptuous
furniture for a house. All this being set in a most marvelous order, four and
twenty men advanced, bearing two and two twelve coffers of China, garnished
with gold and precious stones, who being placed as the rest, made way for
twelve Slaves to be seen carrying Torches in their hands, which were covered
half way with plates of gold, and shined more with the precious stones that
were on them, then with the flame which consumed them. Until then the Grand
Vizier had beheld this ceremony with a great deal of admiration and
astonishment; but when as after these Torches he saw twelve other Slaves carry
a great Canopy of crimson velvet, covered with another Canopy, higher then
that, and all enriched with plates of gold, the curtains thereof close drawn,
reaching to the very ground, he passed from astonishment to grief; especially
when he saw that this Canopy was followed by a Charet, covered with cloth of
gold, drawn by six white horses, and accompanied with thirty of the fairest
Slaves that ever had been seen, being all on horseback, with their hair hanging
loose upon their shoulders, and attired with as much magnificence as gallantry.
For calling to mind, that this pomp was like unto that, which the Turkish
Emperors use for their own daughters, when as they cause them to be conducted
to the Palaces of them, whom they give them for husbands, he believed that
Soliman would at length constrain him to marry Asteria, to bind him wholly to
his service; and in this thought he had already resolved to lose his life, both
out of a sense of love, and out of a sense of Religion, before he would consent
unto it. But he was strangely surprised, when as the Grand Signior had made a
sign to the Aga of the Janissaries to draw the curtains of the Canopy, to see
upon a white steed, held by two black Slaves, his incomparable Isabella. Ah my
Lord! cried he out in Italian, Is not this an illusion? may I believe that I
see? and do not my eyes beguile me? And then losing all respect in this
encounter, he went maugre his weakness, and without attending Soliman's answer,
to help the Princess off from her horse, and to clear himself thoroughly of the
doubt whereinto this surprise had put him; but he could not execute his design,
for the Aga of the Janissaries had rendered him that service already, and had
conducted her to the half pace of the balustrade, where the Bassa received her.
This Princess had not seen him yet, because at such time as the curtains, which
concealed her, were drawn, the sight of so great an assembly had not permitted
her to mark him, though she had carefully sought about with her eyes to find
him out. But when as Ibrahim advancing toward her, did by the sound of his
voice force her to look that way, she had no less joy then he, though not so
much amazement; for she knew well enough that he was at Constantinople, and she
believed too that she had been forcibly brought away by his order, for Rustan
would never tell her any thing. And though this violent design was not pleasing
to her, yet felt she nothing but joy for all that at this first v^ew; nor did
the paleness and change, which Ibrahim's melancholy had painted in his face,
any whit afflict her; being very glad to see the marks of his love, in those of
his grief. Is it possible, Madam, said Ibrahim unto her, that I should once
more see the incomparable Isabella? Is it from Love or Fortune that I hold this
grace? Neither from the one nor the other, replied Soliman in Italian, who was
come to the top of the half pace, but from the good will which I bear thee, and
from the desire I have to preserve thy life. This voice brought respect again
unto Ibrahim, who told the Princess that she saw the greatest Monarch of the
world, for fear she should not render unto Soliman the honor that was due to
him. Isabella would instantly have cast her self at his feet, when as this
Prince raising her up, against the custom of the Grand Signiors, and beholding
her with a great deal of admiration, I do not marvel, said he unto Ibrahim,
that love has been stronger in thee then friendship; and that the sight of so
rare a creature has been dearer to thee then all my favors: But it is not
requisite that so many persons should be spectators of thy felicity; and it
will be enough, if thou suffer me to be partaker of it with thee. Saying so, he
commanded the Aga of the Janissaries to cause all that had been brought thither
to be carried into Ibrahim's Palace, and to send every one away but only those
which were to serve the Princess.

In the mean time Emilia, who came in the Charet, that followed the Canopy
under the which Isabella had been placed, lighted out of it, and repaired to
her; the Slaves that were destined to wait on her in her chamber followed her
also, and in that order, the Grand Signior marching foremost, and leaving
Ibrahim to lead Isabella, they went up the stairs, entered into his chamber, and
passed into his Cabinet; where they were no sooner arrived, but the Sultan
beginning to speak acquainted the Bassa, how having seen that his melancholy
was invincible, and knowing that the absence of Isabella was the cause thereof,
he had desired to make it cease without parting with him. That besides, to the
end there might be nothing wanting to his felicity, he had not caused her to be
thus brought away, without considering the sequel of it, and that the Princess
might live contentedly in his Empire, where she should always have as much
power as he. That for so much as regarded her Religion she might not only be a
Christian in her heart as he was, but even in the sight of all the people. That
there were examples of the same in the Othoman family; that Mahomet the second
was the son of the D^spot of Servia's daughter, whom Amurath had married both
out of love and interest. That the same Mahomet had married the sister of the
Emperor of Constantinople to Zogan Beglierbey of the lower Macedonia, with
permission for her to have the exercise of her Religion as freely, as if she
had been amongst the Christians. That these examples sufficed to ke^p the
people from accusing him of introducing a Novelty; but in case they should dare
to murmur at it, he knew well enough how to make himself be obeyed. To all
these particulars Ibrahim had nothing to say but to thank Soliman; for although
upon a second thought, the joy to see Isabella again was crossed with some
unquietness, yet he found no occasion to complain. The Princess on her side,
coming thus to learn, that it was not Ibrahim which had caused her to be
brought away, was much comforted therewith; being very glad to see that his own
interest had not carried him to expose her to such a violence.

In the mean time Soliman continued beholding Isabella with a world of
admiration; for albeit the grief she had been in had a little altered her, yet
the joy to see Ibrahim, and the agitation of her spirits, had brought a
carnation into her cheeks, which covered all the marks of her melancholy; and
which rendered her as fair, as ever she had been. The Grand Signior being
surprised with too much attention in considering this Princess, desired at
leastwise that the Bassa might not interpret it amiss; so that to conceal it
in some sort, it must be acknowledged, said he unto him, that thou had reason
to assure me, that the pictures, which thou have placed in thy chamber,
resembled this Princess but very imperfectly; for the more I seek for the air
and features of those pictures in her face, the less comparison do I find in
them.

Hitherto the Princess had not answered to Soliman's discourses, save with
obeysances and submissions, but hearing her self so highly praised, she fell a
speaking, and humbly besought the Grand Signior he would be pleased to justify
the love, which Ibrahim bare her, by some other way, then by that of her
beauty. She told him, that if he had not stronger chains then that, he would be
blameworthy for preferring her before his Highness; but without considering,
either her merit, or her beauty, he was to think, that the affection which he
carried to her, was one of the inevitable effects of sympathy or sat. That she
requested him to believe, how Ibrahim had done nothing, but what he could not
choose but do; that he knew without doubt as well as she, that the glory to
serve so great a Prince, was to be preferred before all things; but his
knowledge being the least of that which governed his will, he had abandoned
Reasons party, to follow that of love. Soliman ravished with the wit of this
Princess, desired her to pardon him for her forcible bringing away, and to
remember that he had not undertaken it, but to save Ibrahim's life. So fair a
cause, answered the Princess, could not produce a bad effect, and whatsoever
can save Ibrahim, can never wrong Isabella. With such like discourses, the
Sultan and these two illustrious Lovers entertained themselves very pleasingly;
but dinner time approaching, the Grand Signior told the Bassa, that having
purposed to bestow the Sultania Asteria upon him for a wife, and his love not
permitting that he should be so happy, as to have the most excellent man upon
the Earth in his alliance, he would at leastwise bring him Isabella with the
same pomp, and with the same ceremony, as if she had been his daughter indeed.
After so obliging a discourse, he retired, leaving Isabella extremely
satisfied, both of his wit, his courtesy, and generosity.

The Fourth Book.
AFter the Grand Vizier had waited upon the Sultan forth, he returned to
Isabella with so much transport and joy, as he had never felt the like before;
the liberty to be able to speak to her, without other witnesses then Emilia,
was so sweet unto him, that neither the remembrance of what was past, the care
of the present, the fear of the future, nor even the weakness which his
melancholy had brought upon him, was sensible either to his body or his mind.
I would undertake more exactly to describe the apprehensions of these two
illustrious persons, were I not persuaded that one had need to have made trial
of the like misadventures, and the like pleasures, before one could worthily
acquit himself thereof. After the first transports, which unexpected joys do
cause in a soul, and which for the most part do somewhat disorder Reason,
Ibrahim and Isabella, coming to consider the estate wherein they were, found
that Fortune had but gilded over their Irons; yet was it some consolation to
them, that they might wear them together. I would not follow you to
Constantinople, said Isabella to Ibrahim, without being your wife; nor would I
likewise that love should have carried you to make me be forcibly brought away:
but since without your or my being guilty thereof, Fortune has conducted me
hither, I have courage enough to endure this noble captivity with you, until we
may meet with some means to get out of it with honor.

After many other discourses Ibrahim caused dinner to be served up to the
Princess in private, during the which he went to give order for preparing him a
lodging at Achmat's Palace, which was not far from his, intending out of
respect to leave this wholly to the Princess; but she being instantly
advertised thereof by Emilia, who had heard him give order for it to the
Italian Slave that served him, she sent for him, and conjured him not to do so;
I am well assured, said she unto him, that in the Country where we are, I shall
not clash with civility to remain here with you; and I know you to be so wise
and discreet that I cannot fear any unjust designs from you; withal you
understand me too well for me to doubt, that you will make any ill construction
of the liberty I give you: It will be enough then for you to quit your lodging,
without quitting your Palace unto me, which how fair soever it is, cannot be
agreeable to me without you. This illustrious Bassa would not yield at first,
but at length he obeyed the Princess.

In the mean time they who saw Ibrahim, could not doubt but that Soliman had
found out the right remedy, which could thoroughly chase away his melancholy.
His eye was quicker, his countenance more lively, his speech stronger, his gate
more steady, and this change was so great and sudden, that every one spoke of
it as of a prodigy. In fine, the presence of Isabella did that in a few days,
which the art of the Physicians could not do in a very long time; and the Grand
Vizier found himself in so perfect an health, as he had never been in a better.
But whilst he was happy, Soliman did not enjoy so great a tranquillity: The
sight of Isabella through an inevitable fate had excited trouble in his soul.
For whereas he had eminently met in the person of this Princess with all the
beauties of Roxelana and Axiamira, and a great deal of resemblance of both of
them, especially of the last, he could not choose but be in all the passion for
her alone, which he had been in for the other two. This great Prince rendered
not himself for all that without fighting; and it may be he had not been
vanquished, if at the beginning he had known the forces of his Enemy. But what
trouble soever the first sight of Isabella brought to his heart, he thought
notwithstanding that Reason, and his friendship to Ibrahim, would be stronger
then his inclination. It was not because he had not tried the weakness of the
former; but for the second, he believed that nothing could overcome it. In this
confidence, the first days of Isabella's being at Constantinople, and that
Ibrahim was not as yet in an estate to go to the Serraglio, he continued
visiting him as he was wont to do: But the more he saw Isabella, the more
charming he found her; he always observed some new grace in her; and her wit
making her still to be more known, his passion still augmented the more:
Howbeit he perceived not the violence and power of it, till such time as
civility would no longer permit him to see her. For the Grand Vizier having
recovered strength enough to go to the Serraglio, Soliman having no more
pretext to visit him, saw himself deprived of the sight of Isabella, and by
this privation he felt in his heart that this person alone could make up all
his felicity, or all his misery. This Prince no sooner knew the force of this
Enemy, by which he had suffered his soul to be surprised, but ^e would have
opposed it. What! said he to himself, unjust and cruel that I am, cannot I,
after the obtaining of so many Victories abroad, vanquish my self this once?
must I be mine own cruellest Enemy? and must this predominant passion, that
reigns in my heart, be always stronger then Reason? cannot I love, continued
he, but I must be criminal? and is my destiny so unlucky, that I cannot be
happy, without violating all that is most sacred in the world? All the Earth
yields me Slaves; the fairest women of all Greece are in my power, and in my
Serraglio, and in the mean time I will ravish from the only man that I love,
the only person that he can love, the only person that can preserve his life;
he that, being the noblest of men, has ventured it an hundred times for the
safety of this Empire, and he that rather then he would break his word with me,
had resolved for death in abandoning Isabella. Ah, no, no; let us rather dye,
then consent to this unjust passion; let us deprive our selves for ever of that
which only can make us happy, since we cannot be so without ingratitude and
baseness.

After so just a reasoning, Soliman seemed sometimes to be eased, and to have
taken an immovable resolution to think no more of Isabella's charms. But her
image no sooner presented it self to his mind, but changing his resolution, he
also changed his discourse. I know very well, said he, regarding things as I
do, that I owe much to Ibrahim, but I know withal, that I owe very much to my
self. It is not always reasonable for one to give himself death to save the
life of his friend; I am not ignorant that friendship ought to be firm, but yet
I know, that love has not used to respect it. And then again, who knows
whether Ibrahim will yield Isabella to me? he that could resolve to leave her
at Monaco to return to Constantinople, may peradventure yield her to me for the
saving of my life. For what can a man do less for me, whom I have drawn out of
Irons, and from the grave, and have made the mightiest man in my Empire? Let us
love then, said he, since we may do it without a crime. But alas! continued
he, when as Ibrahim has consented to my love, I have not vanquished Isabella;
and then he called to mind the constancy which she had showed ever since the
first day that she had begun to love Ibrahim. This difficulty for all that
seemed not so great unto him, but that he hoped to overcome it, if he could
absent the Grand Vizier, as the affairs of Persia seemed to require. Whereupon
he framed the design of it, after he had a long time combated in himself, and
prepared to give audience to the Ambassador the Sophi had sent to demand
Axiamira and Felixana of him; seeming to have no other thought then that of the
affairs of Persia, nor other object, but the good of his Empire. He also let
Vlama know, that what he had demanded for Mahamed was granted him; and the care
of his State seemed to take him up in such sort, as albeit he became very
melancholique, and that his countenance was altered, Ibrahim suspected no other
thing, but that the incertainty wherein he was, whether he should make use of
the persons of Axiamira, Mahamed, and Felixana, whom he had in his hands, for
the making of some propositions of peace, because he was pressed by the affairs
of Hungary, or that he should continue the War of Persia.

In the mean time Ibrahim and Isabella, considering their fortune, could not
well imagine by what way they might obtain their liberty; it being incredible
that Soliman should be carried to the design of forcibly bringing away the
Princess, for to let her return again into her Country, and to deprive himself
for ever of a man, from whom he seemed to be inseparable. So as not knowing
what to do, or what to resolve on, the Grand Vizier propounded unto her,
considering the estate wherein things were, that she would permit him to make
one warlike voyage more against the Persians; to the end, that having repaired
the disorders which his absence had caused in that Kingdom, he might at his
return come and cast himself at the Sultan's feet, and demand for a reward of
his victories only the liberty of returning into his Country; with the
resolution, that if he did not grant that which he desired of him, not to be
more generous then he, and to obtain that by slight which he had refused him,
since, as it seemed to him, he might do it without injustice. At first this
proposition surprised Isabella; and her heart persuaded her, that Ibrahim had
not Reason on his side. What, said she, will you always abandon me? and will
you find no place in all the world where we may live together? when you were
come to Monaco, you quitted me to return unto Constantinople; and now that
Fortune has brought me thither, you will abandon me to go into Persia; but
with this grievous difference, that when as you quitted me at Monaco, you left
me in my Country; your person was the only thing that I lost; your absence
made up all my grief; and fear found no place in my soul but for the love of
you: But in this encounter I have cause to be afraid of all things. You will
abandon me in a Country, whose language, manners, customs, and Religion, are
different from ours, and where virtue is not found but in the person of
Soliman. I will not make use, continued she, of the Reasons, which you made use
of, when you would not let me come to Constantinople, in making me consider
what would become of me if it happened that you should dye: But that is not my
fear, seeing it is certain, that in what place soever of the Earth this
misfortune should arrive unto me, I should always be equally sensible of it;
that nothing can increase or diminish my grief; that I shall every where find
the remedy to finish it; and that my death would without doubt keep me from
regretting yours. I do not fear you should dye without me, but I am afraid to
live without you. Do not think then of abandoning me, and if you will go into
Persia, suffer me to go along with you.

The Bassa hearing the Princess speak in this sort, knew not what to answer
her; and though he found no other way of hoping to obtain from Soliman the
liberty which he desired, yet durst he not oppose Isabella's pleasure. Do,
Madam, what shall seem good unto you, said he unto her; dispose of my fortune,
and my life; and believe, if you please, that the same reason, which carried me
to abandon you at Monaco, has now induced me to make this proposition unto
you. But do not think of following me to the war; it is the only thing wherein
I may contradict you in this encounter, and I am resolved never to consent unto
it. I will not go into Persia, if you enjoin me to it: I will go and make
Soliman deny me our liberty in demanding it of him; I will even endevor to
think of our slight if you will; and by all these ways expose you, it may be,
to strange misadventures: I will notwithstanding consent to all these things,
if you command me; but I will never endure that you shall undertake a warlike
voyage. For, Madam, there is a great deal of d^fference between living at
Constantinople under the protection of one of the excellentest Princes of the
world, and following an Army of an hundred thousand men, who delight in nothing
but fire and sword; and against whom you would have but one to protect you, if
your beauty should happen to give me Rivals, or the misfortune of war should
make me be vanquished by mine Enemies.

I know well enough, answered the Princess, that I am of a sex which ought not
to see war save in picture; but what will you have me do? I see too well,
continued she, that we are in a deplorable estate, and that we cannot seek for
a remedy, whereof the event is not very doubtful. After the obligations wherein
you stand engaged to Soliman, there is no talk of slight; yea and I feel in my
heart something that resists it. On the other side, I know full well that in
the estate wherein the affairs of his Empire now stand, and his friendship to
you considered, it will not be easy for my tears to obtain our liberty; and
from thence I judge, that nothing but generosity alone can constrain him not to
refuse us. Upon the victory over the Persians our freedom depends, if it be so
that we may ever obtain it; but I fear too, that this remedy is not very well
assured. For if you prove not fortunate in this war, how dare you demand your
liberty? and if you be victorious, it is to be feared that in fighting for
Soliman, you fight not against your self; that the conquests you shall make for
him, do not keep him also from resolving to part with you; and in this sort, I
cannot make use of the power which you do give me to dispose of you in this
occasion, my reason not being strong enough alone of it self to take any
resolution.

Ibrahim saw that all the Princesses Objections were so powerful, as he could
think of nothing able to destroy them. But at length, after well examining the
matter, they found how it was true, that it might happen the voyage of Persia
would serve them to no purpose: but they found withal, that it was the only
thing that could be beneficial to them; knowing well enough, that if Soliman
could be vanquished, it would be only by generosity. Ibrahim assured the
Princess as much as possibly he could, that no misfortune should arrive to her
in his absence, relying in such sort on Soliman's friendship to him, as he
could not doubt but that he would be very careful in protecting her. And though
he knew that the Sultan was very susceptible of love, and that he had feared
before at Monaco, lest he would have been too sensibly touched with Isabella's
beauty, if she obstinately persisted in her determination to follow him to
Constantinople, yet had he no fear of it in this encounter. That which gave him
this tranquillity of spirit, was because he knew, that this Prince had never
been taken, but with the first sight of the persons whom he had loved; that
love never entered into his heart but by surprising him; and that whomsoever he
had once seen without passion, was not able afterward to touch him with any.
And whereas Soliman, contrary to his custom, had taken great care to conceal
his thoughts, he had not perceived his love to Isabella; but contrarily,
thinking that he had seen her without loving her, he believed that he was safe
on that side. In this Opinion he the more easily resolved for the War of
Persia; and whereas he knew that affairs were pressing, and that the Sophi's
Ambassador having had audience, the Divano would be held the next day, wherein
peace or war for the interest of the Empire would be concluded, he conjured the
Princess to take her last resolution. Emilia, who was present at this Council,
was on Ibrahim's side, and persuaded the Princess to consent to the voyage he
would undertake. And to carry her the sooner thereunto, the Bassa told her
further, that diverting Soliman's Arms from Hungary would render a great
service to Christendom; and that this action might peradventure obtain from
Heaven the liberty which they so much wished for. He added moreover, that
without doubt this war would not be long, because the manner of the Persians
was, not to fortify their Towns, so that having no important sieges to make,
the business according to their custom would be decided by the gain or loss of
a battle.

Upon these and many other reasons the Princess resolved for this grievous
separation, and Ibrahim having left her, after they had made new protestations
of fidelity the one to the other, he went unto Soliman to begin the preparing
of his mind to the war of Persia. This Prince, who never swerved from the way
of virtue but by constraint, had fought so mightily with the passion wherein he
was for Isabella, as he might perchance have defeated it, or at leastwise have
never made show of it, had not the Grand Vizier himself contributed to his own
misfortune, in propounding unto him his sending him again into Persia. For
whereas it is very difficult to reject that which may satisfy us, it was
impossible for the Sultan to refuse that which Ibrahim offered. He had had
strength enough, after a long combat, and after he had an hundred times
changed his opinion, to resolve not to propound this voyage unto him, since he
could not undertake it without quitting Isabella; but he had not enough not to
accept of that which could content his passion. He determined for all that,
because the matter regarded the good of his Empire, to have it proposed in the
Divano, to the end the people should not murmur, and might know that he had not
preferred war before peace, until he had well examined the importance of it.

The day following at seven of the clock in the morning, twelve thousand
Janissaries appeared in Arms in the great Court of the Serraglio; for in regard
it was a Council of War, where the Grand Signior assisted in person, there was
more ceremony used then in the Divano, which was accustomed to be held for
affairs of peace; the Halls of extraordinary audiences were opened, and hung
with the richest hangings that the Grand Signior had. There was seen at one
end, under a cloth of State of curled cloth of gold, a Throne, raised four
degrees high, covered with gold Tinsel, and in the midst of it four cushions of
the same stuff, for his Highness to sit upon. All along the Hall were little
low seats, adorned with cloth of silver, for the placing of all the Officers of
the Empire, who came thither very early, in the richest and bravest apparel
that they had. The Beglierbeys of Natalia and Lavandali, with those of Amasia,
of Cairo, Siria, Europe, and Romelia, were present there; so were also the
Capitan Bassa Governor of Constantinople, and all the chiefest Sangiacs, namely
of Morea, of Nicopoli, Philopali, Tricala, Negrepont, and others; the Aga of
the Janissaries was likewise there, together with the Tesqueregibassi, to
execute his charge of principal Secretary of State if need required: In
conclusion, there was not any of all the Officers of the Turkish Monarchy
lacking there, but only Rustan, who was not yet so well re-established, as to
be present at Ceremonies. After they were placed according to their degrees,
and that to manifest the more greatness and respect they had attended a long
time with an extraordinary silence, the two Capigibassi, or Captains of the
Port, entered into the Hall richly clad, having each of them in his hand, for a
mark of their charge, an Indian Cane garnished with gold and stones, and went
and stood on either side of Soliman's Throne: After them entered the Grand
Vizier, Ibrahim, as being chief Bassa, marching alone two paces before the
Sultan, whom two Bassa's supported under the Arms, and behind him three of the
children of honor, who waited on him in his chamber, and carried a great
cushion of cloth of gold, all set with precious stones of an inestimable value:
Next after followed a many of other Officers of the Empire, and a great part of
the principal Eunuchs of the Serraglio. When as the Grand Signior appeared, all
they that were in the Hall, both on the right and the left hand, rose up; and
as he passed by them, they saluted him after their mann^r, with their hands
across on their breasts, and bowing their heads down even to the ground.
Ibrahim, who marched foremost, mounted up to the Throne, whither the two
Bassa's conducted Soliman, who being set, caused our illustrious Bassa to be
placed at his feet upon the highest step; upon the second on the left hand the
two Bassa's that had led him, with the Cadilescher of Greece; and on the right
the Bassa of the Sea, and the Cadilescher of Natalia; the three children of
honor, after they had set down the cushion which they had brought behind him,
retired to the Eunuchs; and the Capigibassi seated themselves on the lowest
step, at the feet of the Bassa's. As soon as the Grand Signior had made a sign
with his hand for every one to sit down, each one reassumed his place, after
they had again made a low obeisance to the Sultan, and keeping a most
extraordinary silence for so great an assembly, they continued a while in this
sort, as it were attending the Grand Signior's Commands; who after he had
thought a little of what he was to say, began to speak unto them. He told them,
that although he could resolve all things by his absolute power, yet in regard
it concerned the glory of his Arms, the greatness of his Empire, and the good
of his subjects, he would not frame any design, without communicating unto them
the matter he had in hand; to the end that having acquainted them with the
importance of it, they might give him faithful and dis-interessed counsel.
After that, he represented unto them the victories which he had obtained over
the Persians through the valor of Ibrahim; and then, the misadventures, which
his absence and Vlama's ^urt had caused in that Country. He told them that
nothing rested of all his conquests, but the remembrance that they had been
made: and whereas he had an intention to carry them to a war, he aggravated
with a great deal of vehemence, how shameful it would be to the Empire to make
peace after they had been last beaten. He told them withal notwithstanding,
that having the Princess Axiamira the daughter of the Sophi, and Prince Mahamed
his son, in his hands, he was in an estate, if they thought fit, to tender
propositions of peace unto Tachmas; but that they should well examine
beforehand, whether that would not be dishonorable; and that they should
remember, how in public interests particular interests were not always to be
considered, and that the glory of the Empire was to be preferred above all
things.

After he had spoken thus unto them, he commanded them to deliver their
Opinions, which proved not to be alike, for they were all carried by different
thoughts. Some, won by Roxelana and Rustan, opposed the voyage of Persia;
others, for the sole interest of the people, were of the same opinion; some
again, to please the Sultan, counseled the war; and others, for their
particular interest likewise, opposed peace. Yet did they not for all that
deliver their Opinions tumultuously, nor without giving reasons for them; but
contrarily keeping a marvelous decorum in this Council, they spoke all
severally, and without precipitation. But whereas, according to the order which
is observed amongst the Turks, Ibrahim was to deliver his Opinion first, as
being the chief in dignity, he was already preparing to speak, when as Machmut,
Cadilescher of Natolia, who had been suborned by Roxelana, besought his
Highness, that for this time only that custom might not be followed, to the
end that the Opinions, which should be given in this occasion, might be the
more sincere. For, my Lord, said he unto him, I am assured if the noble Ibrahim
propounds his Opinion first, that it will be impossible for me to deliver mine,
if it happen to be contrary to his; not because I cannot take the liberty to
contradict him if I could, for I know his generosity too well for that; but
because his Reason renders it self so absolute a Mistress of another, as it is
not possible for one to conserve his own sense. A man cannot defend himself
from him; he persuades whatsoever he pleases; and one cannot choose but gainsay
in his mind his own Opinions. In fine, my Lord, whether it be for the love
that is born him, or for the reasons that I have alleged, I am very certain,
if the generous Ibrahim speaks first, that his vote will carry all the rest;
that there will be but one Opinion found in the whole Assembly; and that in
this sort, thy Highness will not know our true sense, but wilt only understand
Ibrahim's, which doubtless we shall but say over again. It is not because I do
not believe his counsel to be better then any other that can be given thee; but
I conceive, that for diverse causes, which regard Ibrahim himself, it is
requisite thou should leave us to be guided by our own Reason.

In this sort it was that the subtle Machmut, instructed by the cunning
Roxelana, got the order of the Divano to be changed; for though this
proposition displeased the Grand Signior, yet durst he not for all that reject
it; and so much the less, because Ibrahim himself besought his Highness that it
might be so, after he had notwithstanding told Machmus, that he was not so
eloquent, as he would make him believe; and that he was persuaded also, how all
those which he saw there, whom the Sultan honored with his presence, did not
regard any thing, no more then he, but the interests of the Empire, and the
glory of his Highness.

After this, the Bassa Piali spoke first, and was of the opinion, that no
propositions of peace should be tendered, in regard they had been last beaten;
but withal he was of the mind, that without making such great preparations
for war, they should only stand upon the defensive, and retain Prince Mahamed
and the Princess Axiamira, whereby without doubt the Sophi would soon be
brought to speak first of this peace, which then might be accepted of, if it
were propounded with reasonable conditions. Scander Capitan Bassa, speaking in
his turn, said, that a great Prince and a great Polician should never be
contented with being in an estate of defending himself; that he should always
either carry the war to his Enemies, or not make it at all; that it was better
to make peace, then not to make conquests; that not to assail ones Enemy, when
one was in Arms, was in a manner to be vanquished, or at leastwise to testify
fear, or weakness; that in this occasion he did not see there was any choice to
be made; that it would be without example to make propositions of peace to a
Prince, who was contented to offer two millions for the ransom of his daughter
and Felixana; and that it would show much imprudence, not to prepare for war,
after the refusal of them to him: so that in regard they were not to be rendered
because they were not prisoners of war, nor to be kept without being in a
condition to defend them, his advice was, that to obtain peace, and oblige
Tachmas to demand it, an Army of five hundred thousand men was to be levied, to
the end that fear might carry him to propound it advantageously for the Turkish
Empire.

Machmut, Cadilescher of Natolia, said, that whereas it was never counted a
design either base or shameful in a Prince to procure the peace of his
subjects, he conceived that if it were possible to make use of the persons of
Prince Mahamed and the Princess Axiamira for the obtaining thereof, it was to
be done: and so much the rather, because in continuing this war, the treasures
of the State would be unprofitably exhausted; the power of the Sultan would be
impaired by the loss of the Janissaries which would perish in it; yea and the
honor of the Arms of the Empire would be once again hazarded: and all this
without attending any recompense from it, it being absolutely impossible to
maintain the conquests that were made in Persia, whereof History gave
sufficient proof; and therefore if war were to be made, that it was better to
fall upon the Christians with an Army of five hundred thousand men, which would
strike fear into all Europe, amplify the limits of the Empire, and eternize
the name of Soliman, rather then to lose them to no purpose: How it would be a
shame to see one day in History, that Soliman had warred a long time against
the Sophi; that at several times he had led millions of men into Persia, and
after all, that there should not be remaining under the dominion of his
successors, so much as one foot of ground of the conquests he had made there.
Finally he concluded, that not this war, but the other, was to be thought on.

Isuf, Cadilescher of Greece, maintained this Opinion, though out of a
different meaning; for the former was carried by the persuasions of Roxelana,
and he by the sole consideration of the public good. But he added to the
others Reasons, that if the war of Persia continued longer, whole Provinces
might revolt, by reason of the poverty whereunto the interruption of commerce
would reduce them; in so much that this foreign war might cause a civil, more
dangerous and more deadly then the other; that if this mischief should arrive,
as the murmuring of the people seemed to threaten, they should then be
constrained to propound a shameful peace to Tachmas, who it may be, to make use
of this advantage, would not accept of it; that so they should have Enemies
both without and within, whilst the Christians, which were but Tributaries of
the Empire, might possibly undertake to shake off the yoke which had been laid
upon them; and that all Christendom besides might peradventure unite their
forces together, seeing Soliman busied elsewhere, so reconquer that which had
been taken from them.

Hali, the Bassa of the Sea, was of the opinion, that not only there should no
Articles of peace be propounded, that not only there should be preparations
for war, but even that no propositions from the Sophi should be accepted of, if
he happened to make any. How it was just that Soliman should surpass his
predecessors in something; that they had conquered from the Christians, as well
as he; but that none had conserved that which they had won from the Persians;
that it was for him to change this order; that it was a weak reason to say,
that since they had conserved themselves till then maugre all the Othoman
power, and that the victorious Selim, his Highness Father, had vanquished them
with loss, therefore one could do no more; that contrarily it was a mark their
ruin was near; that Empires had their ages as well as men, and being subject
to the revolutions of fortune, it was credible that this extraordinary
constancy, which she had showed in protecting of the Persians, would quickly
change; that it being so, it was not to be doubted but that this illustrious
victory was reserved for the greatest Prince, that has been since Alexander,
the most renowned Hero's of antiquity, and the most in veneration amongst the
Turks; that the Empire of the Persians was not so flourishing as it was at such
time as it was overthrown, nor Soliman less valiant, then he who had conquered
it; that in fine it was reasonable, after the Sultan had traveled so much for
the felicity of his Subjects, that his Subjects also should do something for
his glory: so as he was of the opinion, that without considering whether the
people murmured or no, an expedition should be made into Persia with all the
Forces of the Empire.

Achmat Bassa, speaking in his course, consented indeed to the voyage of
Persia, but not to the d^sign of impairing the Empire on all parts, to make new
conquests on that side; since without hazarding any loss of the one side to
gain on the other, there needed no more then to oblige Ibrahim to make one
journey more thither; that it was without doubt from his hand Soliman was to
attend this victory; that it was easy to judge of the future by things past;
and that the Sultan without venturing any thing, and to retain both his
Subjects and his Tributaries in their duties, should abide at Constantinople,
as in the center of his Empire, to give order for all things, and to prepare
Crowns and Triumphs for the illustrious Bassa, who would without question
return Conqueror of Persia.

Next was the Beglierbey of Romelia of the same opinion; He of Carro concurred
with him; and all the rest being divided amongst the seven that had already
spoken, it was for Ibrahim to deliver his advice; but he was constrained to
attend a little, because Machmut said a second time to maintain his first
opinion, that it would be a shame to be exposed to the loss of the advantage
which they had over the Christians. Achmat answered, that it would be a greater
to demand peace after they were beaten. The Bassa Piali added, that extreme
resolutions were dangerous to Monarchies; and that in the end Princes, which
loved their Subjects, and whose Empire was great enough, ought not to make War,
but for the procuring of peace. Isuf, to fortify this opinion, said further,
that the people were not to be so little considerable with the Emperor, since
from them came his riches, his force, his power, and his greatness; that the
people had in some parts of the world been happy without Kings, but no Kings
could be so without Subjects: He said likewise, that prudence never did any
thing precipitously, and still would have the Prince spare the blood of his
people. But the Bassa of the Sea replied, that it was oftentimes just and
necessary to lose one part of his Subjects for the preservation of the other;
and that an Empire was a great Body, for the maintenance whereof all things
might be done, without considering particular interests. Scander added, that a
great Prince was never to make peace but with the sword in his hand, and that
the way to keep the people from murmuring, was to make it advantageously; that
for the effecting thereof five hundred thousand men were to be raised, to the
end they might obtain that by force which could not be obtained by any other
mean.

This Bassa having given over speaking, Ibrahim repeated in order all the
opini^ns that had been given; he confuted that of the Bassa Piali; approved
that of Scander Capitan Bassa; mightily opposed Machmut's advice, as also that
of Isuf; commended the generous resolutions of Ali the Bassa of the Sea, and
the prudent considerations of Achmat, with exception nevertheless of the
praises he had given him. But at length for a conclusion he said, that great
Princes were always to give peace, and not to demand it; that if Soliman's
children had happened to have been the Sophi's prisoners, all that could then
have been done was but to propound it; and that even Tachmas was so generous as
not to do it, though Prince Mahamed and the Princess Axiamira were in his
Highness hands; that it was a gallant thing in the Vi^torious to speak of
Peace, because they thereby demonstrated, that the sole desire of glory had
made them fight; but that it was always shameful, how specious a pretext soever
might be taken up for it, to speak of peace, when as one had been beaten. That
this were to yield up the Victory, and to render ones arms to his Enemy, to
implore the pity of the Conqueror, to augment the courage of his adversaries,
to weaken that of his Soldiers, and even to expose himself to the hazard of
having done an unworthy act unprofitably; that besides, the only mean to keep
Christendom from uniting their Forces for the destruction of the Turkish
Empire, was to let it breathe a little after so much War, because if it were
further provoked, it might peradventure do that which it would not do, were it
left in rest; that it was many times dangerous to prosecute ones enemies too
much; that tempting Fortune so often, she might be weary of favoring, and at
last abandon those whom she had protected; that to keep her from changing, we
were to change our design, and suffer our selves to be conducted by her, and
not force her to follow us; that after all, he did not find, that any
deliberation was to be had upon the matter in question; that Tachmas being in
arms, and offering no Proposition of Peace, albeit his Children were under the
power of his Highness, it would be an unheard of and shameful thing to think of
it, especially if it might be remembered, that it was not yet a year since
Soliman had been crowned King of Persia at Bagdet; that it would not be a shame
for the Sultan to make no more Conquests upon the Christians, but that it would
be a great one for him to let himself be vanquished by the Persians, or at
leastwise to demand Peace of them; that for so much as regarded Prince Mahamed
and the Princess Axiamira, in the estate wherein things were, they could not be
rendered upon any conditions; yea, and that it would be most unworthily done to
remit them into the hands of the Sophi for the making of Peace, because they
were not prisoners of War, but contrarily were persons fled for refuge; that
Soliman was therefore to protect them, to make War both for their sakes, and
also that he might not be ungrateful to Vlama, whose Fortune was conjoined to
Felixan's; that the War had never had more juster grounds, then since the time
that the Princess Axiamira, Prince Mahamed, and Felixana, were in the power of
the Sultan; that one of the prime duties of a King, was to protect the
oppressed; and that in this encounter there was too fair an occasion presented,
to be lost; that as for him, he offered, if his Highness pleased, to return
unto this War, and not to spare, either his care, his blood, or his life, for
restoring the honor of his arms to the point, wherein it had been.

Ibrahim had no sooner made an end of speaking, but they, who had been of a
contrary opinion to his, seeing the Grand Signior favor his party, began to
change theirs in appearance; professing that his reason had cleared theirs. And
Machmut was he alone, who seeming to yield as the rest, opposed himself still
notwithstanding to this resolution: But Soliman having made a sign to him to
hold his peace, he kept silence as well as the rest of the assembly; and the
Grand Signior, having commanded the bringing in of the Persian Ambassador,
spoke softly to Ibrahim, but yet finished his discourse aloud in giving him
order to answer this Ambassador according to his sense, so that as soon as he
appeared, the grand Vizier rose up, and after he had made a low obeisance to
the Sultan, he told him how he was to assure the Sophi his Master from his
Highness, that his State should always be an inviolable sanctuary to all
oppressed Princes; that the Princess Axiamira and Felixana being no prisoners
of War, the Grand Signior, far from accepting the ransom which was offered for
them, declared by him, that he would become their Protector, as well as Prince
Mahameds; and that he would shortly go with a very mighty Army to execute his
Highness Commands, and to see Justice rendered to these exiled Princes. The
Persian Ambassador thereupon labored to make it appear, that Axiamira not
having been entreated as a person sled for refuge, since she had been in
prison, was to be taken for a prisoner of War; and for a conclusion he added,
that if she were not delivered up, the Sophi would come with an Army of two
hundred thousand men to make her be rendered unto him. But the grand Vizier
having answered him, that he would save him the labor of coming so far, and
that he would go and meet him even in his own Country, he was constrained to
withdraw, as he did with satisfaction little enough. He was no sooner gone
forth, but the Grand Signior arose, after he had commanded the Officers of the
Empire, in all things to obey Ibrahim, as if it were himself, and in particular
the Bassa of the Sea to prepare for his departure with the Naval Army, to go
and fall upon Mingrelia, of purpose to make a diversion, and divide the Enemies
Forces.

After this Commandment, the Sultan returned in the same order as he came, only
one of the Capigibassi remained in the Hall, to the end that according to the
custom he might cause all those, which had assisted in this extraordinary
Council, to be presented with a rich Gown, which is given to all the Officers
of the Turkish Monarchy, from the Grand Signior, so often as he honoreth the
Divano with his presence, which happens but seldom. The two Bassa's which
conducted the Emperor having left him alone with Ibrahim, he told him that
there rested nothing for him now but to take his leave of Isabella, because all
the Troops, which had been levied for the making up of his Army, being already
far advanced, all that he could do was to overtake them upon the frontire; that
he was sorry he was constrained to separate him from a person that was so dear
unto him; but he was to remember that glory was the fairest Mistress in the
world, and how it was not but for her that he abandoned the Princess. Ibrahim
answered thereunto, that the sole glory of his Arms carried him on, for he
assured his Highness, that in the voyage he was going to undertake, he
considered not himself at all; and in the mean time, that he might part with
some satisfaction, he besought him he would promise to protect Isabella in all
things during his absence; and if he happened to dye in this War, that he would
send her back in safety to any place which she should please to make choice of.
This discourse touched Soliman; he was ashamed of his own thoughts and
weakness; and little lacked but that craving pardon of Ibrahim, he had opened
his heart to him, and acknowledged his crime with repentance: Howbeit love was
the stronger, and that virtue, which this Prince followed in all other
encounters, was too weak in this for the resisting of so powerful an Enemy.

He abandoned himself then unto it, and with an equivocating answer promised
the Grand Vizier, that he would protect Isabella against all the world; that
there was not any subject of his whom he would not severely punish if he should
displease her; that for what he had demanded of him in case he should dye, was
a thing whereunto he could not answer, that thought being too grievous for him
to settle his mind upon it; that for her more safety during his absence, he
held it fit that Isabella should not abide in his Palace, but should pass away
that time in the old Serraglio, in the company of his mother, of his sisters,
and his daughters; that the Sultana Asteria, to whom he was somewhat obliged,
should take care to entertain her; and that for the exercise of her Religion,
she should go forth as often as she would; that his making of this proposition
proceeded from the remembrance of the seditious tumult, which was raised at
such time as he was in Natolia; for whereas the people and the Janissaries were
persuaded that this War was undertaken by his counsel, if by mischance news
should come, either true or false, that he had been beaten, he feared lest the
fury of the one or the other, or of both of them together, should fall foul on
his Palace, and Isabella be involved in that disorder. Ibrahim, seeing a great
deal of reason in that which the Grand Signior said, humbly thanked him for his
providence, and told him that he would go and propound the matter to Isabella:
But he knew not that this proposition was made, rather to undo then preserve
her; and that this Prince, whom he believed to be so generous (as indeed he was
when as love did not trouble his Reason) thought not so much of the Conquest of
Persia, as of the Conquest of Isabella.

In this dangerous ignorance he went to the Princess, and made that proposition
to her which the Sultan had made to him, but not till he had rendered her an
account of all that had past in the Divano. At first that name of the Serraglio
affrighted her, and her modesty could not suffer him to continue speaking
without interrupting him; But after she had told him I know not how often that
she could not resolve to go thither, she was constrained to alter her mind,
Ibrahim having made it appear to her, that the old Serraglio was the only place
of all the Orient, where the most virtues, and the fewest vices were. As
indeed, it is not inhabited by any but the Mother, Aunts, Daughters, and
Sisters of the Emperor, who never have any commerce with the Sultana's of the
other Serraglio, unless it be with the Sultana Queen, which lives in the Grand
Signiors lodging. For touching the people abroad, they never see any of them;
having no other entertainment then to learn Needle works and Music, which
certain Jewish women teach them; to walk in their gardens, which are very fair;
to receive the visits which the Sultan sometimes gives them, especially when
his Mother is still living; to look out at the windows, which open upon the
Port and the City; and to see the public ^easts when they are celebrated at
Constantinople: living otherways with a great deal of reservedness, until the
Sultan marries them to some of his Bassa's, for a recompense of some great
Conquests achieved by them. Isabella, having then understood all these
particulars, ^urmounted the aversion which she had against the entering into
that place, and was at length persuaded that she should be much better amongst
women, then to live alone with Emilia and Slaves in the Palace where she was.

This resolution being taken, the grand Vizier gave order to his servants to
prepare all things for his voyage, that he might part the next day, and
expressly forbad them after that from co^ing ^o speak to him of any affair, if
it were not directly from the Grand Signior; intending to employ the small time
he had resting, in talking with Isabella. Never was conversation so sad as
theirs; and seeing that which they had resolved upon even ready to be executed,
they almost repented them of the design they had undertaken. Ibrahim would not
willingly have parted, and yet prepared to part. And the Princess in testifying
to him that she could wish he would not abandon her, spoke to him of their
farewell and separation. Remember, said she unto him, that in the War, whither
you are going, you must have a care, not only of your own life, but of mine.
Think not so much of the victory, as not to think of preserving your self: And
to oblige you thereunto, remember every time you go to fight, that in defending
your life, you defend Isabella's; that upon your return depends her felicity;
and that if you love her, you will not think so much of vanquishing, as to keep
your self from being vanquished. That can I never be, Madam, answered he, after
so many glorious marks, which I receive of your affection: And since in
preserving mine own life, I shall preserve yours, there is no Enemy which can
be redoubted of me, and which I shall not easily surmount. Remember yet, Madam,
that on Victory our happiness depends; that to obtain it I must expose my self
to peril; that in all other things Fortune gives the good that she does, but in
War Crowns must be violently plucked out of the hands of Victory, if one may be
permitted to speak so. One must fight to remain Master of the field; one must
give an example for the Soldiers to follow, and put ones self in jeopardy of
being vanquished for to be victorious. I tell you all these things, Madam, to
the end you may not take it ill, if I dare assure you, that I will not remember
you, but to fight with the more courage. You are a captive for the love of me,
it is for me then to deliver you, and therefore do not enjoin me to manage my
life with so much care. But, Madam, without anticipating our miseries through
fear; and without increasing those, which we feel through the apprehension of
those which peradventure will never arrive unto us, tell me, I beseech you,
whether you can forgive me all the evils which I have been the cause of to you,
if you do not represent unto your self how you have favorable received the
affection of a man, who was once reckoned amongst your enemies, and who by a
strange fate in ceasing to be so, has been the occasion of more misery to you
in adoring you, then all your cruellest adversaries, purposing to hurt you,
could have done. Do not charge your self with the crimes of Fortune, said she
unto him, and believe that I am generous enough to distinguish the guilty from
the innocent, and never to remember the evils which I have suffered, without
remembering those withal, which you have endured for me. I am as faulty toward
Justiniano, as Justiniano is toward Isabella; or to say better, we are equally
innocent; and our innocence it may be causes our persecution, since it is
ordinary with Fortune to fall foul upon none but virtuous persons. I hope
nevertheless, added she, that Heaven will ere long give an end to our
captivity, or to our lives. If we were, continued Isabella, in the hands of a
Prince, that used us ill, and laded us with irons, I should methinks have the
more consolation, for in murmuring against the Tyrant that persecutes us there
is some to be found: But this Prince, who keeps us captives, does it not but
because he loves you; and the rigor of my destiny is so great, as I must
commend that in him, which is the cause of all my misery. It was in this manner
that these two illustrious unfortunate persons entertained one another until
night, when as they parted, more out of civility, then for any desire they had
to sleep.

The next morning the grand Vizier went to take his leave of his Highness,
intending to defer his bidding adieu to Isabella, and giving his last thoughts
to one, to whom he had given all his heart, as long as possibly he could.
Soliman received him with an unquietness, which he took for a mark of his grief
to see him depart, but to speak truly of things it was the last combat which he
had in his Soul. The remorse of his crime, and the shame of his weakness, had
like to have carried him once more to repent him; nevertheless love was still
victorious over this illustrious Conqueror. This Prince then embraced Ibrahim,
after he had talked with him about the War, and had given him an absolute power
to treat of all things without advertizing him thereof; and preventing what the
Bassa was going to say to him, he assured him that Isabella should be served
during his absence in all respects, as the Sultana Queen; and that he had given
order for Charets to bring her and all her Slaves to the old Serraglio, where
the Sultana Asteria should have a particular care to entertain her. After this,
he dismissed Ibrahim, who went to the Bassa of the Seas Palace, to will him to
set sail as soon as he could, in regard the Squadrons of Metelin, of Rhodes, of
Ciprus, and Alexandria, were already joined together; and that with all this
Fleet he should steer his course for Mingrelia. This order given, he returned
to his Palace, where he found the Charets, which the Grand Signior had sent, to
carry Isabella to the old Serraglio. And whereas the hour of parting pressed
him, he went to the Princesses chamber to advertise her of it, and to desire
her that he might conduct her to the place, which was to serve for a sanctuary
to her, during his absence. She granted him his desire, without knowing almost
what she did, so extreme was her grief. And after a conversation as sad, as
their Souls were afflicted, she reached him her hand, which Ibrahim kissed,
with as great a transport of grief, as of love. And conducting her with Emilia
to the Charet, which was prepared for her, he went and accompanied her to the
gate of the old Serraglio, where they took their last farewell.

It was at this instant that they felt that which cannot be expressed; You had
reason indeed, said the Princes to him, to steal away from me when you left me
at Monaco, and to save me the grief of bidding you farewell; but I do not know,
said she unto him, whether you have any now to make me prove it. Is it your
pleasure then, Madam, answered he, that I shall not part? No, replied she, do
not you stick at what I say; it is only grief that makes me speak: Go and break
our chains, carry a stronger heart then I, and that you may not augment my
weakness, do not oblige me to bid you farewell. As she was saying so, the gates
of the Serraglio opened, and Ibrahim, seeing himself constrained to quit her in
a place where men never come, assured her at this last instant, that be would
quickly return a Conqueror. The Charet was no sooner entered, but he mounted on
horseback, and without speaking a word more to any body, he went out of
Constantinople with his Train, to overtake the Troops, which were marching
toward Persia, carrying in his heart the most sensible affliction, that ever
he had tried. He had this advantage nevertheless over the Princess, that he
could entertain his thoughts without interruption, but it was not so with her.
For as soon as she had been conducted to a stately lodging, which was prepared
for her, the Grand Signiors Mother, ^lthough she hated Ibrahim, came to visit
her followed by all the Sultanaes, thereby to please Soliman, who had entreated
her unto it. The Sultana Asteria, as the favorite of the Emperor her father,
had been permitted to learn the Italian Tongue, after the goodwill she had born
to Ibrahim had made her to desire it; so as it was she that held up the
conversation in this visit, and that expressed the compliments of the other
Sultanaes to Isabella, who received them with a great deal of civility,
although the extreme grief she was in might have dispensed her from it. But
whereas Asteria had address and wit, and knew that Isabella was afflicted, she
so ordered the matter as this visit was not long. The Sultanaes went away then
charmed with the beauty of the Princess; and Asteria found her self as much
inclined to serve her, as she had been before time to save the life of Ibrahim.
It is true, that though they were all gone but this last, yet was not Is^bella
at liberty to think of her misfortunes; for the Sultan sent the Bostangibassi,
who is as it were the Superintendant of the Gardens, and one of the chiefest of
the Port, to present her with three maunds of Gold engraven, full of flowers
and fruits manured with his Highness own hand; the Religion of the Grand
Signiors obliging them, as well as their Subjects, to labor in some work, that
may gain their living; it being unjust, as they believe, for them to be
nourished at the peoples charge. And whereas agriculture has something
delightful in it, and that the gardens of the Serraglio are the fairest in the
world, Soliman, to satisfy both the custom, and his Religion, which requires
it, had many times watered with his own hand the flowers which he sent to
Isabella. He gave her to understand, that had it not been for fear of
incommoding her, he would have come and comforted her for the departure of
Ibrahim.

The Princess received these presents and civilities with a great deal of
respect, and desired the Bostangibassi by the mouth of the Sultana Asteria, to
tell the Grand Signior, that if there had not been too much presumption in
letting her self be persuaded, that he would do her the honor to visit her, she
would have testified unto him how dear this glory was unto her; but not daring
to hope for it, she contented her self with assuring his Highness, that she
would share in all the obligations wherein the grand Vizier stood engaged unto
him, and that in her particular she would all the days of her life be very
sensible of them. The Bostangibassi being gone, she craved pardon of the
Sultana Asteria for the trouble she had put her to in serving her for her an
Interpreter: and that she might find occasion to talk to her of Ibrahim with
civility, she thanked her for saving of his life in times past, told her, that
in consideration thereof she owed her all things, and since Ibrahim could not
acknowledge it to her himself, it was for her to do it. Asteria, who certainly
had wit, generosity, and more address, then the retirement wherein she lived
seemed to permit, answered her, that her sight and acquaintance recompensed her
beyond that which the service she had rendered her deserved? That pity, being a
sense so natural to the sex whereof she was, she merited no great glory for
having had compassion of so gallant and handsome a man as Ibrahim. For,
continued she, although I know very well, that they talk amongst the Christians
of us, as if we were barbarous; yet I can assure you, that this rule is not so
general, but it has exceptions: And pity, which is a thing quite opposite to
that which is believed of us, is one of the first precepts of our Religion; it
extends even to unreasonable creatures; and there are found amongst us such
careful Observers of the Law, as they buy up Birds to let them fly. Judge after
this, whether that which I have done, deserves to be ranked in the number of
extraordinary things; and whether contrarily there had not been cause to
wonder, if seeing a man carried to dye, whose countenance so little resembled a
Slayes, or Malefactors, I should not have had the thought to save him. And then
again, added she, if any one ought to recompense me for this action, it must be
the Sultan, since I have preserved him a man, whose brave actions have rendered
his Empire famous, and whose merit and conversation has made up all his
felicity ever since he was here. For as for you, continued she, I do not see
how you are obliged to me; if I had been contented with saving of Ibrahim's
life, you might well have said so; but since it was I that was the cause of the
Sultan's seeing, loving him, and retaining him in his service, methinks I ought
rather to demand pardon of you for robbing you of him, then to attend thanks
for his preservation.

Isabella, who did not think that Asteria was acquainted with all her history,
knew not how to answer her, which the Sultana perceiving, desired her not to
marvel if she understood by her discourse, that she was not ignorant of all her
adventures. She told her then how the Sultan her father had been almost
constrained to impart them unto her, for a reason which she would tell her
another time, it being unjust to keep her any longer from the liberty of
lamenting an absence, which could not choose but be very grievous unto her.
Isabella was so satisfied with the civility and wit of Asteria, that she felt
some consolation, in finding a reasonable person in a place, where she imagined
there had been nothing but stupidity; so that to oblige her she requested her
with a great deal of tenderness and respect not to leave her for that reason,
nor to defer to another time the acquainting her with that, which she would
fain hear, although she knew it. Asteria then recounted unto her, what Ibrahim
had already told her, namely, that Soliman had purposed to have married her to
him; but she particularizing the matter further unto her, in letting her know,
how this business had not been so hastily carried, but that some days were
past, after the Grand Signior had spoken to her of it, when as Ibrahim's
discourse obliged him, to propound it sooner unto him then he had intended.
That whereas he could not foresee how this marriage should be disagreeable to
Ibrahim, he had resolved to have had her conducted to his Palace upon the day
of his Triumph, to the end he might do the more honor to the grand Vizier, but
that he had been hindered from it by a Persian, named Alibech, who came to
demand Justice of him against the Bassa of the Sea, and had kept him till it
was night in the Hipodrome. That having learnt all these things from the
Sultan's own mouth, and seeing afterward that nothing came of all this, she
had cast her self at Soliman's feet, and besought him to let her know, for what
cause Ibrahim had refused her; and that after many entreaties, having had
experience of her discretion in other encounters, he had declared unto her the
truth of the matter. That after this she had far more esteemed of the Bassa
then before; and that his fidelity to her had in such sort touched her heart,
as far from being incensed against him for the refusal he had made of her, she
had commended him for it in her talk with Soliman. Do not disquiet your self,
said this Sultana to Isabella, if I dare say to you, that I have been your
Rival; that Ibrahim's glory had touched my inclination; and that I could have
resolved with joy to have been his wife; since I had not thus opened my heart
unto you, if it had not been free enough to offer you all manner of service,
and to assure you, that that which I felt for the Bassa could not be named
Love, but a simple desire to marry a gallant and virtuous man. Do not regard me
then as your Rival, seeing that could not be without hatred, but as a person
that has no stronger a passion, then to serve Ibrahim in you. You are too
generous, answered Isabella, and Ibrahim too happy, for him to be indebted to
you. I should condemn him nevertheless, continued she, for not failing in his
fidelity to me, had he had the honor to know you, but his misfortune has made
him commit this fault: Do not accuse him then for want of judgment in
preferring my conservation before your Conquest, since his ignorance has been
the cause of it; and seeing you know my whole life as well as I, lament us
without accusing us. But what say I, added Isabella reprehending her self,
rather admire Ibrahim's good fortune, in that he could oblige you to save his
life, and afterward gain the affection of the greatest Prince of the Earth;
and to join our good fortunes, as our interests are joined, I must add further,
in having procured me the honor of your acquaintance.

This conversation, having lasted an indifferent long time, combined the
Sultana Asteria and the Princes in so strait a league of friendship, as they
were almost inseparable, so long as Isabella continued in the old Serraglio.
The day after she was come thither, Soliman visited her, and by this last sight
made the chains which captived him stronger then before. The incertainty he was
in, wholly ceased; and the combat which he had in his heart, between his
f^iendship to the grand Vizier, and the passion he was in for Isabella, was at
an end; and love remaining absolutely victorious, his mind had some more
peaceable moments, so that he had no other thought, then of the Conquest of
Isabella. But whereas he knew, that to make himself be beloved, he must first
please, he complied so far with her, as not to speak of any thing but Ibrahim
in this first visit. He craved pardon of the Princess for being the cause of
his absence from her; he desired her not to remember it was he that caused her
to be brought away by force; and to think that she was in a place, where she
might absolutely command; where she should see no body but that would obey and
serve her with joy. Isabella answered to so obliging a discourse with all the
civility and acknowledgment she was capable of: but whereas she was sad, though
she constrained her self to seem otherwise, he entreated her to be as merry as
she could, for fear lest melancholy diminishing her beauty, it might be laid to
his charge, that he had but ill preserved so rare a thing.

The Princess having promised him all that he desired, he went away very much
satisfied, and very amorous, and left her with as great an esteem of him, as
Ibrahim could not have more. And whereas Asteria seldom abandoned her, she
talked to her the rest of the day of nothing but of the admiration she was in
of Soliman, of the virtues of this Prince, of the greatness of his spirit, of
that exceeding and generous friendship, which he testified to our illustrious
Bassa.

After this first visit there were nothing but magnificences in the old
Serraglio. Soliman sent every day new presents to Isabella; and in
consideration of her to the Sultanaes, which lived in the same place, for fear
lest envying her they should come to hate her, and so lose the care of pleasing
her. And whereas there passed not a day, wherein this Prince did not visit
Isabella, Roxelana, who knew him to the very bottom of his heart, quickly
perceived the true reason that caused these visits. Yet did not jealousy seize
upon her Soul for all that; and the only design of making use of this occasion
to destroy Ibrahim, and to labor the re-establishment of Rustan, was that which
made her work in the manner, as shall be seen in the sequel of this discourse.
But for as much as the grand Signiors Mother hated Ibrahim, because she loved
Roxelana, she communicated her suspicions unto her, and they both concluded,
that in all likelihood Soliman's assiduity was an effect of love; and that if
it were so, it would be almost an infallible mean to destroy the grand Vizier,
who it was said was desperately in love with this person. For coming to know
this passion, he would questionless do things, which would make him be
banished, if he did not voluntarily banish himself.

Having held this secret counsel, Roxelana, far from troubling Soliman's
designs, thought of nothing else but making him more in love with the Princess;
being not jealous but of her authority, and fearing Ibrahim's power, much more
then Isabella's beauty. And for this effect, whereas there is scarce any faith
in Turkey of proof against presents, she suborned one of the Slaves, who went
daily to offer her some new liberality from the Sultan, to the end that
according to the occasions she might invent some obliging compliment to him
from Isabella, who ignorant of all these things, lived with as much content and
rest, as the absence of the grand Vizier would permit her. Asteria had so great
a care of her, and Soliman rendered her so many devoirs, as she had scarcely any
leisure to think of her misfortunes. In the mean time the Sultan was not a
little perplexed, out of the fear he was in to discover his love to the
Princess; for albeit he knew she esteemed him, yet he believed that it was as
much for the affection which he seemed to bear to the Bassa, as for his own
merit. So that not daring as yet to declare himself openly, he contented
himself with praising her beauty, her wit, and all the excellent qualities
which were in her, in talking to her of Ibrahim; and this name, which had been
so considerable with him, was employed against him that owed it. For so often
as he commended Isabella, he would exag^rate how happy Ibrahim was to be
beloved of so marvelous a person; what judgment Ibrahim had showed in the
choice he had made of her; and out of a malicious gallantry he told her many
times, that Ibrahim was to blame for abandoning her at Monaco, to come and keep
his word with him; that it was a great fault in him to go to the Persian War,
and not to dye with grief, rather then to quit her; that for him, if he had
been in his place, he would never have done so, thinking it a great deal
sweeter to dye, then to be absent from her. So artificial a discourse, was not
for all that interpreted by Isabella as Soliman desired, and without seeking
for any hidden sense in it, she believed that it was a pure effect of the
Sultan's compliance, who thinking to please her, would talk to her of Ibrahim
in any manner whatsoever. In this ignorance, she always answered him very
civilly, and with a great deal of respect; so that interpreting in this sort
all that Soliman said unto her, she put him into an extreme pain. For without
telling her precisely, that he was in love with her beauty, he would fain have
had her perceive it; being so afraid to offend her, that this fear peradventure
might have wrought that in him, which Reason could not do, had it not been for
the messages, which the Slave whom Roxelana had suborned, at several times
brought him.

But whilst Isabella talked of Soliman's generosity, all the Sultanaes had no
other discourse but of the love which he bore her. Asteria, perceiving it as
well as the rest, and knowing to what violences this passion carried the Grand
Signior, was much afflicted at it, for Isabella's interest, whom she
exceedingly loved. This melancholy was quickly marked by the Princess, and
whereas her cares and her merit had given her an high place in her affection,
she one day conjured her to acquaint her with the cause of it. Asteria judging
with reason, that if she should tell her the truth, it would very much grieve
her, excused her self from it at first as well as she could; but coming to
consider, that it might be the ignorance wherein Isabella lived, might further
augment her unhappiness, she resolved to confide in her, and to impart unto her
the suspicions she had. That which made Asteria be interessed so strongly for
all that concerned Ibrahim, as to forget the Sultan's interests, was because
she had understood how mightily he had protected Mustapha and Gianger her
brothers, whom she had infinitely loved; and how he had always opposed the
violences of Roxelana, to whom she bore a secret hatred, whose chief foundation
was in her proper virtue. Asteria, following her resolution, after she had
prepared Isabella's mind by a long discourse, to make good use of the advice
she was going to give her, and after Isab^lla had on her side promised her all
manner of fidelity, told her, that knowing the Sultan her father, as she did,
she feared lest her beauty had poss^st him with more love for her, then he had
friendship for Ibrahim; and that at last his reason would be found weaker then
his passion: That she desired to discover her suspicions unto her, to the end
she might through her prudence examine the matter, lest being altogether
ignorant of it, she might increase the Grand Signior's unjust designs by
innocent civilities.

At first this discourse surprised her, she changed color ever and anon, and
out of the trouble she was in, she thought that Asteria spoke not the truth,
though she could not imagine any reasonable cause for this fiction. The
Sultanaes ingenuity notwithstanding destroyed this secret accusation, which she
charged her within her heart; and passing from one extremity to another, she in
an instant justified not only Asteria, but Soliman also, and calling to mind
all that this Prince had done for Ibrahim, she believed that the Sultana gave
an ill interpretation to the Grand Signiors civilities; and took that for
testimonies of love, which she was persuaded was but an effect of his
friendship to Ibrahim. This last thought having quieted her mind, she thanked
Asteria for the care she had of her, commended her generosity and wisdom; and
testified at last how she could not believe that so great a Prince, as Soliman,
could be capable of letting himself be vanquished by so unjust a passion, as
that was whereof she spoke. I wish it may be so, said the Sultana Asteria, both
for the glory of Soliman, and your content; but take heed, as I have already
told you, that your beauty be not more powerful in the Soul of the Grand
Signior, then his friendship to Ibrahim. If that should be true, replied the
Princess, it would rather be an effect of my unhappiness, then of my beauty;
but I profess unto you that I shall never resolve to accuse this Prince, till I
am forced thereunto by himself.

This conversation being ended, and the Sultana gone, Isabella found not her
self so quiet; howbeit Emilia confirmed her in the opinion, that Soliman's
respects to her proceeded only from friendship, in making her consider, that
Asteria's conjecture was questionless grounded on the belief of all the other
Sultanaes, who supposed that the Grand Signior could not have any affection for
a woman, but straight it must be love; and who out of jealousy for the
presents that he sent her, and the civilities that he used to her, had imagined
it could not be otherwise. This reasoning carrying some likelihood with it,
comforted the Princess a little, and after she had run over in her memory all
that Soliman had said, she found, being willing to deceive her self, that all
his discourses and all his actions, might be interpreted to his advantage: yet
saw she not so much certainty in all that she imagined, that she durst
absolutely rely upon it: and though she feared the sight of the Grand Signior,
out of the doubt she was in of finding him guilty, yet had she some instants,
wherein she desired it, out of a hope of justifying him.

Roxelana on her side, having communicated her design to Rustan, and he
approving of it, they thought of nothing but of augmenting Soliman's love to
Isabella, by the obliging messages, which that suborned Slave delivered to him
daily. It was at the same time, when as there were three marvelous beautiful
Slaves presented to the Sultan, who without being ever a whit touched with
their charms, had refused them, if he had not by chance demanded of them whence
they were; but having understood that they were of Italy, he retained them with
a purpose to bestow them on Isabella, seeking after nothing with more care,
then to please her. He went then to visit her, after he had commanded that
those three Slaves should be carried into the old Serraglio: And whereas
Asteria's discourse to her had rendered her more melancholique then she used to
be, he marvelled at it, and by his much pressing her to let him know the cause
thereof, he made the Princess apprehend, that the Sultana's suspicions were
justly grounded; yet destroyed she her self, this her own opinion: and having
answered the Grand Signior, that her melancholy was derived from the
remembrance of her past misfortunes, rather then from any other reason, he
desired her to forget them, and not to render her self unhappy with things,
which would never arrive to her again. He told her afterward, that to comfort
and delight her, he had chosen her out three Slaves, which it may be would not
be disagreeable unto her; and would understand her orders better then the
others which had been given her, because they were of her own Country. Isabella
answered thereunto very civilly, and the Grand Signior having commanded them to
be brought in, the Princess was strangely surprised, when she saw that these
three Slaves were Sophronia the sister of Leonora, Leonida, Alphonso's
Mistress, and Hippolita, Doria's sister. She had no sooner perceived them, but
she gave a great skrick, then turning her self to Soliman, May it please thy
Highness to pardon me, said she unto him, if I lose the respect which I owe
unto thee, and if the joy to see persons that are so dear to me, is stronger in
me then good manners. In saying so, after she had made a low obeisance to the
Sultan, she went and embraced her dear friends; who were no less amazed and
glad then she, to encounter her in a place, where they hoped for no consolation.

This first complement being over, Isabella once again besought the Grand
Signior to pardon her, if friendship and surprizal had constrained her to fail
in that which she owed to him. The incomparable Isabella, answered he, can owe
nothing to any body; and in what place of the world soever she can be, she can
never want Slaves. This civility is too excessive, replying the Princess
blushing, and I shall hold my self infinitely obliged to thy Highness, if thou will give me for companions these three fair maids, whom Fortune has made thy
Slaves. I have already said, answered he, that Isabella may command absolutely;
and I swear unto her further, how there is but one only thing, which she may
not obtain of me.

After this speech, whereof the Princess durst not demand the explication,
Soliman would needs know of her, whether these three beautiful persons were of
Genoua, as well as they were of Italy; and when she had informed him that they
were, he used a great deal of civility toward them; and enquiring of Hipolita
where her brother was, he understood that he and three of his friends were
Slaves in Constantinople. My Lord, said Isabella unto him presently, in casting
her self at his feet, I humbly beseech thy Highness to grant them their
liberty. We have not used to refuse Isabella any thing, said he unto her,
lifting her up; and without enquiring who Doria's friends be, I declare them
free; and in what hands soever they are, their chains shall be instantly
broken. Sophronia, Hipolita, and Leonida would have fallen on their knees to
render him thanks, but he not permitting it, told them, how it was Isabella
they were to thank, and not him. And having d^manded of them, to whom their
friends were Slaves, they answered, that he which presented them to his
Highness could tell to whom he had sold them.

The Grand Signior, desiring to oblige the Princess in all things, went away
for to leave her at liberty to entertain her dear friends, and to take order
for the delivery of those Slaves, whom she had recommended unto him. When he
was gone, embraces and civilities began afresh between Isabella and these three
fair maids: Emilia likewise testified the satisfaction which she had to see
them; but in the midst of their first apprehensions of joy, the remembrance of
their pleasures past, made them shed tears of sorrow. They demanded of one
another, by what adventure they were met together in the same place; and being
scarce able to believe what they saw was true, their amazement redoubl^d every
moment. The desire of demanding one thing was lost by the curiosity of knowing
another, and going both at once to ask the Princess questions, and to answer
those which she asked of them, neither of them answered precisely to each
other. Howbeit the Princess understood that those Friends, which were Slaves,
as well as Doria, were Horatio, the French Marquis, and Alphonso. She desired
to hear some news of the Count of Lavagna, and of Leonora his wife, but
Sophronia told her sighing, that she should know their adventures too soon; and
Hipolita added, that in a day wherein Fortune had done them so great a grace,
it was not fit to remember so many misfortunes.

In the mean time Isabella, who seared lest the name of Serraglio should
disquiet them, and make them conceive something to her disadvantage, acquainted
them with the difference which there was between the old Serraglio, and that of
the Grand Signior's women. And whereas in her discourse she many times named
Ibrahim without thinking of it, and spoke of him, as of a man, in consideration
of whom the Sultan favored her, Sophronia demanded of her, who this Ibrahim
was? This question made the Princess blush, but at length she informed them
that this Ibrahim was Justiniano; it seeming unto her, that in the estate
wherein their fortune stood, it was not requisite to make a secret of his
adventures to them. This novelty equally surprised Hipolita, Leonida, and
Sophronia; not being able to imagine, but that all which they were told was any
other then a fiction: Their own experience forced them notwithstanding to
believe, that what had been imparted to them was true, there being no more
difficulty in giving credit to that which was arrived to them, th^n to that
which had happened to Isabella.

When it was almost Evening, the Bostangibassi came to the Princess from
Sol^man, to tell her, that according to her order (for he was commanded to
speak to her in those terms) he had caused Horatio, Doria, and Alphonso to be
delivered; but for the other, he could not possibly learn as yet where he was;
that all he could understand of him was, how in less then a month he had
changed his Master nine or ten times; but he besought her not to be troubled at
it, assuring her that he would the next day make a general review of all the
Slaves in Constantinople, rather then fail in finding out of him, whom she
desired to have: That moreover, the Sultan was very sorry he could not leave
with her the three persons, which he had presented unto her, out of a belief
that they should have been her Slaves; for in regard they were not to be
entreated so, it would be the abusing both of their Religion and Custom, to let
so many persons of a free condition, and of a faith differing from his, be in
the old Serraglio. Howbeit, not to deprive her altogether of a conversation
that was so agreeable to her, she might go every day and visit them at
Ibrahim's Palace, where their friends were already attending for them, and
whither he had order to conduct them; assuring her that they should be served
there with as much care, as respect. The Princess received this news with a
great deal of grief; and she would fain have obliged him that brought her this
message, to have gone and besought his Highness from her, that he would permit
her to accompany her friends to the Grand Visiers Palace; but he answered her,
that the order which had been given him was absolute, and how he could do no
other then execute it.

Isabella it may be would have redoubled her entreaties, had not the Sultana
Asteria arrived: who having been informed of the estate of things, counseled
her not to exasperate the mind of Soliman, and to comply with him in this
particular, which he did not desire of her without some reason; it being very
certain that it was altogether extraordinary to see persons, that were free and
Christians, in the old Serraglio. Isabella, who knew the virtue and discretion
of Asteria, resolved to yield to that which was desired of her, in taking leave
of her dear friends; who left her with tears in their eyes, having this comfort
notwithstanding that they were going to meet, not only with their Brothers,
but with their Lovers also; for Time, Fortune, and Slavery, had not changed
their hearts: Horatio, Sophronia's Brother, loved Hipolita still; so did Doria,
Hipolita's Brother, Sophronia; and in like manner Alphonso continued constant
to Leonida. But for Isabella, she remained without any consolation, but that
which was given her by the hope she had to go the next day and visit these fair
unfortunate ones, whose encounter had possessed her with as much grief, as joy,
both by the thought that they were not Slaves, and the displeasure she was in
for being so soon deprived of their sight.

The Fifth Book.
IT was no sooner day, but Isabella sent to desire permission of the Grand
Signior, that she might go and visit her dear friends, which he durst not deny,
so much was he afraid to displease her; He repented him nevertheless for having
made Hipolita, Sophronia, and Leonida go out of the Serraglio; and feared lest
that which he had done for his content should destroy it; for it was true, that
he was not carried thereunto, so much by the requisiteness of things, as the
doubt he was in, that he should not be able to speak to the Princess in
private, so long as they were with her. Isabella then, having obtained the
permission which she had demanded, went to Ibrahim's Palace with as much
magnificence, as if she had been the Sultana Queen. Horatio, Alphonso, Leonida,
Sophronia, and Hipolita, received her with exceeding satisfaction, yet was it
less for all that then Doria's, who having understood from his sister, that
Justiniano was in that Country, was in so extraordinary an impatience to know
by what adventure he was come thither again, as he had scarcely made his first
complement, when as he conjured her to acquaint him with it: But she, that was
in no less to understand his, and those of his friends, and by what hap they
were arrived there, told him, that he should not know it, till he had informed
her what good or bad fortune had conducted them to Constantinople. Hipolita and
Horatio professed, that that was the least thing they could pay her for the
liberty which she had given them. As for Sophronia, she consented not without
regret to this sad and pitiful relation, well foreseeing that so lamentable a
discourse would cost her many a tear: howbeit she desired at least, that Doria
might be he who might recount their misfortunes, it being impossible for her to
do it. Doria, not using to resist Sophronia, was preparing to obey her, when as
Horatio told his sister, that it would be unjust to oblige him to this
relation, by reason of the name he bore; and albeit that they which were
mingled in this adventure were his Enemies, yet were they still his Kinsmen.
Doria answered thereunto smiling, that Lovers had no others but those of their
Mistresses: But in the end Alphonso was the man that contented the curiosity of
Isabella. As soon as for the honor of Ibrahim's Palace, she had led them into
his Cabinet, and that they were set down there, Alphonso, addressing himself to
Isabella, began to speak in this manner.

The History of GIOVANNI LODOVICO Count of LAVAGNA.
SEeing our misfortunes, and your retirement, have made you almost a stranger
in your own Country; and that your absence has kept you since from knowing our
mishaps, I will content your curiosity, and recount all this story unto you, as
if you had not been born at Genoua, and that all the persons, of whom I am to
speak, were unknown to you; Yet have you not forgotten, as I think, that the
Family of the Fiesques, being one of the noblest, and most illustrious of all
Italy, as having twice furnished a head to all Christendom, given so many
Cardinals to Rome, and so many great men to the world, was that also which
Andrea Doria had always most dreaded, ever since that action which made him
merit the having of a Statue at Genova. They that intermeddle with the knowledge
of things, and that judge not of intentions by appearances and events, will not
have the designs of Andrea Doria to be always so dis-interessed, as they have
appeared unto us; but in fine, this is not a place, where I am to tell you what
the Count believed concerning him: As for me, that ever speaks sincerely of
things, I hold that his intentions were as fair as his enterprise.

But to come to that which I am to impart to you, and to keep you from being
too much surprised by the Counts last action, I am to tell you, that although
in appearance he was the sweetest, the civilest, the gallantest, and of the
freest and most peaceable disposition that ever had been seen, and that he gave
himself to all the exercises of a man of his quality, wherein he had profited
admirably, yet had he an imperious spirit, and was always possessed with some
great design. Ambition, and the desire of glory, were his predominant passions,
and the only things for which he did all others. His education did not
contribute ought to these thoughts; for whereas he remained yet young enough
under the government of his Mother, who was the most ambitious woman that ever
was, she gave him a part of her inclinations. He had had for his Governor one
named Pensa, by Simbaldo his fathers appointment, whose manners were wholly
noble, and that had instructed him in all the fairest knowledges, which a
person of his condition might have. But this man being too moderate for the
bringing up of the Count according to his mothers designs, she placed another
about him, but yet without removing the former, to the end that if the one
taught him the Sciences, the other should teach him not to make use of them,
but to arrive at the height of sovereign greatness. These two men being
opposite in all things, gave him also quite contrary counsels. The first made
him in the Roman History observe the noble actions of those, who had exposed
themselves for the safety of the Commonwealth; and the other made him
oftentimes read the Conspiracy of Catiline, the lives of Tiberius and Nero;
Nevertheless whereas the Counts inclinations were too virtuous to love crimes,
he followed not the advice of this same; but his Soul being withal too
ambitious to be confined within the directions of Pensa, he took a third way,
and loved nothing so much as the reading of the lives of Alexander and Caesar,
especially of this last; and he was wont to say, that they which had called him
Tyrant were to blame; since he can never be so, that aspires not to the
sovereign power, but for the using of it well; and they which found themselves
capable of governing people, were responable to Heaven for not employing a
Talent, which might be advantageous to all the world.

These discourses were not at that time considered but by his Mother, who took
incredible delight therein: but at length, the Count, being arrived at
seventeen years of age, saw Leonora, the sister of Julio and Horatio Cibo, in
an assembly, where Jannetin Doria, the Nephew and Favorite of Andrea Doria, was
present as well as he. You have without doubt observed, that Leonora, though
gentle and civil, had for all that a majestic reservedness, which showed in
her behavior that she had something of great in her Soul. I tell you this,
Madam, to let you know withal, that it was with this charm, rather then with
her beauty, that she began to please the Count. He regarded and observed her
with care; and seeing nothing in all her actions, that was not both extreme
civil, and a little imperious, he began to love her, and so much the more
ardently, because he knew that this alliance would not be disadvantageous to
him; if he sought after either nobility of race, or commodity of riches, for
that being born of a first wife of her fathers, she was her only heir. But if
Leonora was agreeable to the eyes of the Count, it may be said, that he seemed
charming to Leonora's: and verily I must acknowledge, that I never saw him so
amiable, as in this assembly; and if I must speak the truth, I do not believe
that there can scarce be found in one only person greater quality then he had.
And for agreeable things, it may be well assured, that never man was more
proper to make himself be beloved. His beauty, his good aspect, his
conversation, his compliance, his merry and jovial humor, his address in
dancing, in playing on the Lute, in singing, in riding, and all other things
that can give any liking, rendered him incomparable. You may judge after this,
whether Leonora, who had not her heart engaged otherwhere, could refuse the
affection of a man, in whom she found all that she could wish for.

This springing affection was soon known of every one, but especially of Andrea
Doria, who was advertised thereof in a time, when as the Count could not yet
tell very well himself, whether he loved Leonora or no: for the first time that
he began to consider her with indifferency, was on the day of that assembly,
which I have spoken to you of already, and where Jannetin was present, who
always regarding the Count as his Competitor had perceived it, and therewith
acquainted his Uncle. We have learnt since, that Andrea Doria no sooner
understood of the Counts design, but falling into a deep muse he appeared very
sad and unquiet; and that after his musing was over, he commanded Jannetin to
beware of the Counts designs: for, said he unto him raising up his voice, it is
fit for us to observe this young Lion. He is undertaking, and hardy, and if we
suffer him to gather new forces, by allying with the house of Cibo, and
Leonora's riches, he will be capable of enterprizing any thing. Jannetin
harkened to this discourse as one that was interessed therein, and obeying
Andrea's order, he observed the Count and Leonora, and confirmed himself in the
opinion he had had, both by his own knowledge, and the talk of the Town. Being
in no longer doubt then but that the Count was in love with Leonora, he
advertised his Uncle of it, who without further delay commanded him to be the
Counts Rival in this suit. It would not be enough, said he to Jannetin, if we
should but break off the Counts marriage; but we must make profit of his
damage, and pluck the weapons out of his hands, to destroy him therewith when
we ar^ Masters of them. You must marry Leonora, she is fair and amiable; but
were she only noble and rich, it would be enough to oblige you to marry her.
Think of it then, Jannetin; you are young as well as the Count, you have spirit
and courage, and though it may be you have not so good a grace as he, yet you
are Nephew to Andrea Doria, and that is to say every thing. Think then of
winning Leonora's heart, before it be engaged; but above all, come to no
violence; for it imports much, that the adoptive son of him, who has restored
Genoua to her liberty, should not engage him to protect him in such like
things. Jannetin, who held all his fortune from Andrea Doria, and who
reverenced him more then if he had been his father, promised him to forget
nothing of all that should lie in his power to satisfy him; as indeed, all
that care and magnificence could contribute to gallantry, appeared in Genoua at
that time; and had not your melancholy retained you then at Monaco, you would
have acknowledged as well as we, that the like had never been seen.

But whereas the Count could not give place to any body, he no sooner
understood Jannetin's design, but he overtopped him in all things. There was
nothing but running it the Ring, Turneys, Serenades, Balls, and Feasts; and in
all things if the Count was not more magnificent, yet was he more gentile. His
apparel was braver, his horses were gallanter, his matches better made, his
serenades better consorted; in fine, he had the advantage in all things. And
whereas he loved Leonora really, all the testimonies he gave her of it, wrought
another effect in her heart, then the feigned protestations of Jannetin, who
prevailed not with her at all. Things continued a while in this manner, during
the which these two Rivals lived civilly enough together, as well by reason of
the order which Jannetin had received for it, as of Leonora's prudence, and the
Counts address, who never made show of perceiving his Rivals designs; though
each of them did for his part all that he could to destroy his enemy. But at
last Love and Fortune ceased to be blind in this occasion, and gave the prize
to him that best deserved it.

The Count had Leonora's permission to demand her of her brothers, under whose
government she had been ever since the death of her mother; he was their
particular friend, so that upon the first overture which he made to them of it,
they received him with incredible joy, and assured him (especially Horatio, who
was more a friend to the Count then Julio) provided their sister did not oppose
his content, that he was certain to be happy. The Count, who was no less
discreet then passionate, would not let them know that their consent was craved
to a thing already resolved, but only told them, that from their mouths he
desired to understand Leonora's mind, and from them receive either his good or
bad fortune. In the mean time Jannetin found that Leonora favored the Count to
his prejudice, yea and that she was resolved never to marry any but him. He
thought fit to advertise Andrea Doria of it, who came to know by another, to
whom the Counts mother had told it, that he had spoken of his marriage to
Horatio, who had answered her favorably, which Andrea Doria understanding, he
told Jannetin, that he was to conserve with address the friendship of him, whom
he could not destroy by force; that one of the greatest effects of prudence
was, when one could not vanquish his enemies, to constrain them to be his
friends; and not being otherways able to keep them from hurting, one must,
continued he, tie their hands with a false generosity, especially when one has
for opposite an illustrious adversary, such as the Count is. Go then, Jannetin,
said he unto him, give up a victory, which you are not able to carry away; and
making show as though you come to learn that he has a design for Leonora, tell
him that you prefer his content before your love, and so as he will be your
friend, you will yield him your Mistress with joy: But so order the matter,
that this may be heard by some, to the end that the Count knowing how the world
believes he is obliged to you, may also in consideration of the world, and for
fear of being blamed, live hereafter with you, as if he were your friend.
Madam, do not think it strange, that I should know so many particulariti^s of
Andrea Doria's discourses; but be pleased to understand, that a friend does not
so well know what is done in his friends house, as mighty enemies do ordinarily
know what they project one against another: yet was it not equally so between
the Count and Andrea Doria, it being certain that this last knew nothing of the
Counts designs, what care soever he took for it; whereas he on the contrary
could conceal none of his from him.

But to come again to Jannetin, he had been no sooner instructed by his Uncle,
but he went home to the Count, who attended with a great deal of impatience the
answer which Horatio was to make him, for it was he who had in charge to give
it him, he quitted this musing humor to receive Jannetin's visit with his
ordinary civility; and according to Andrea Doria's direction, three of
Jannetin's friends arrived at the same time to be witnesses of these two Rivals
conversation. After the first complements, Jannetin told the Count, that he
came not only to render him a visit, but also to render him up his arms, and to
demand the grace of him, that he might be one of the captives of his Triumph. I
know not, answered the Count, what Triumph you mean. It is a Triumph, replied
Jannetin, wherein for a Trophy of Arms you shall have all the chains of the
Lovers of the incomparable Leonora; who knowing that you alone merit her, will
follow you without regret or envy; at least wise I am come hither to assure
you, that that is my intention: and if I had known that you had born an
affection to her, I would have been your Confident, rather then your Rival; yet
am I not sorry, that I have had the commodity to testify unto you, that
nothing in the world is so dear to me as your friendship.

The Count understood presently Jannetin's cunning, yet would make no show of
it, but contrarily answered him with a great deal of civility and gallantry. I
thought, said he unto him, that I had nothing to vanquish but the rigors of my
Mistress, and if I had believed that I had had so redoubtable a Rival as you, I
had not it may be undertaken to serve her: But since you are so obliging, as to
content your self with meriting her, without pretending to her possession, I am
ravished to know that you have judged her worthy of your esteem; and to
understand that I shall have nothing more then her cruelty to surmount; since
if you had continued serving her, and that she had been just, I should in your
triumph have held the place, which you demand in mine; and which I do not grant
you, seeing he that yields up a victory cannot be said to have been overcome.
Jannetin, hearing the Count speak in this sort, believed, that his cunning had
succeeded, and took that for a testimony of friendship and freedom, which was
but an address of his wit; and that not having been able to vanquish him in
love, he had at least surmounted him in subtlety, and was arrived at the end he
had propounded to himself. But the Count was too clear sighted to be deceived
so easily; and whereas the most dextrous guile is that which persuades our
enemies that they have beguiled us, though indeed we are not; the Count said so
many obliging things to Jannetin, as he made no doubt at all, but that he had
abused his enemy; and that from thence-forward he would count himself
effectively his obliged: nevertheless it proved not so, as you will understand
by the sequel of this discourse.

In the mean time Horatio came to the Count, and having at first embraced him
in naming him brother, he absolutely assured him of Leonora's consent. But not
to stand relating to you the rejoycings of a time, whose felicity is so far
from that which we have past since, I will only tell you, that a little while
after the nuptials of the Count and Leonora were celebrated. You were invited,
but you would not quit your solitude to come and see the magnificences of that
feast. Jannetin was the forwardest of all the City, to testify the joy he was
in for that of the Count, who afterward served him in his suit to her whom he
married; and lived always with him, as if he had been one of his dearest
friends, albeit in his heart he had quite contrary thoughts.

The Counts Mother was ravished with her sons marriage; Leonora was infinitely
contented; Julio seemed satisfied; Horatio esteemed himself very happy in it;
and Sophronia was so much the more pleased with it, for that being of an age
wherein delights, Music, and company make up the happiness of a life, she
found all these things in the Counts Palace, where s^e lived with her sister
after her marriage; for it might be said, that this house was the retreat of
all worthy persons, and of all pleasures, which made the Count to be loved of
every one. In the mean time the prosperous success of his love, had not
smothered his ambition, but contrarily his esteem of Leonora seemed to have
augmented it; and Sophronia, has assured us, ^ow she has often heard him say,
that his Fortune was not worthy of her. This generous Soul had not it may be
for all that been ever capable of the resolution which he took, though ^e
believed it to be just, if the counsels of three men, who did but flatter his
ambition to satisfy their own, had not confirmed him in that design. And truly
it must be acknowledged, that one has never heard speak of an enterprise so
daring in so young an age, of a prudence so extraordinary for the conduct of so
dangerous a thing, and of a success, equal to his, if Fortune had not abandoned
him.

But, Madam, to make you acknowledge that which I say, you are to understand,
that about two years ago the Count finding himself ill for certain days
together, went as he used oftentimes to do into his Cabinet, whither his
ambitions mother came to him, for to acquaint him, that Andrea Doria, who had
adopted Jannetin for his son and successor a good while before, had then made
him his Lieutenant to the charge he held of Generalissimo: And all this,
continued she, whilst you are denied the pensions which the Republique gave
Simbaldo your father; for it was true, that as long as he lived the Senate had
assigned him a pension for a mark of honor, which had not been continued to the
Court, because he had been suspecte^ by Andrea Doria, an enemy of the French,
to be affected to that Nation.

In the mean time to return unto my subject, the Count had no sooner heard what
his Mother said unto him, but would have answered, when as she staying him told
him roundly, think before thou speak of saying nothing to me unworthy of thy
self, or of me that brought thee into the world, and know that I willl disavow
thee for my son, if thou be so base, as to be contented with thy fortune, and
to endure, that they, who do not outgo thee either in birth or merit, should
mount into the Throne, and leave thee amongst the people. This discourse netled
the great heart of the Count, who was but too sensible on that part, yet
concealed he his resentment within himself, and said no more to his Mother, but
that all he could promise her was, how he would absolutely lose himself, or
lose them that oppressed him; and that the sequel or end of his life should not
permit her to complain of him. After this she left him, but to confirm him in
this dangerous design, she had consulted with those three ambitious persons, of
whom I have already spoken to you: the first was the second Governor which she
had given him, named Vincentio Calcagna, whose maxims were contrary to those of
the generous Pensa; the second was called Raphaello Sacco, a Lawyer of Savona,
and a cunning and dextrous man, who served him in the government of all his
affairs; and the last Baptista Verrin, a Citizen of Genoua, who dwelling close
by the Counts Palace, had by his submissions, and his wit, so gained his
friendship, as he was of all his counsel, and disposed almost absolutely of all
his estate.

It was then by the means of these three pernicious Counselors, that this
ambitious woman hoped to carry the Count to the taking of some violent
resolution. She had advertised them to be ready to go to her son, as soon as
she should come out of his Cabinet: As indeed, she was no sooner retired, but
encountering them, she said unto them; Go, my dear friends, and labor for your
selves, in laboring for the Count: but above all things remember, said she to
Raphaello Sacco, to counsel him unto nothing that is violent, which you cannot
give a pretext unto of the public good, of equity, and of glory: for,
continued she, I know the Count so well, that if you propound nothing to him
but his own conservation, his utility, the advancement of his fortune, and the
undoing of his enemies, you will never vanquish him: You must spur his mind
forward with the desire of honor, and dexterously beguile him to keep him from
beguiling our hopes. They promised her then as much as she could wish, and too
faithful in this occasion they kept their word with her; at leastwise Raphaello
and Baptista, for as for the third, he did that out of fear, which another
would have done out of virtue.

They went then to the Count's Cabinet, and to give him no cause of suspicion,
they repaired to him separately. The first that came thither found him in a
deep muse, and never taking notice of him, he continued walking without
speaking a word: A little after, the other two arrived, making show as if they
had not seen one another of all that day. The Count in the mean time, not
doubting of the Treason which they had plotted against his virtue, seeing the
three men of the world, in whom he most confided, come by chance unto him as he
believed, at a time when he had need of counsel, could not forbear testifying a
great deal of joy unto them for it. What good Angel, said he unto them, has
brought you so opportunely to draw me out of the thought I am in at this
present? I know not, answered Baptista cunningly, whether my sight be pleasing
to you or no, but I know very well that I have nothing that is pleasing to tell
you. We are in an age, said the Lawyer, wherein good men have no great cause to
rejoice, seeing every day the ambition of some few carry insolently away all
that which ought to be the recompense of virtue. It may be some one will be
found, continued Baptista, that will make a change in things. But, said the
Count interrupting him, and addressing his speech to Verrin, what bad news have
you to impart to me? My Lord, answered he, it is badder for the Republique,
then for you; for in fine, to acquaint you that Jannetin has still new honors
conferred on him, is to tell you that the power of Andrea Doria will pass into
his hands; that his Tyranny will be perpetuated in the person of his Nephew;
and that we shall never have the happiness to see virtue where it ought to be.

It is certain, added Raphaello Sacco, that this is the sense of all good men;
and in the misery of the age, it seems, said he, addressing himself to the
Count, that all the world turn their ey^^ upon you. Your illustrious and great
birth, accompanied with so many rare qualities as are in your person, makes all
them that love the public good desire, that your fortune were as great as
your heart: And for my particular, I would gladly see your virtue on a Theater
higher then that whereon you are, to the end you might be seen of every one:
But you are born in so unhappy an age, as it seems you cannot aspire to the
power of doing good to your Citizens; so true it is, that Andrea and Jannetin
Doria, under the name of the public liberty, have solidly established their
Power, or to say better, their Tyranny. And in this sort, one may well assure,
that the people do sufficiently chastise themselves for the blind resolution,
which carries them to shake off the yoke of a great and excellent Prince, to
suffer to be imposed upon them that of two Tyrants, who will be so much the
more cruel, by how much they are less accustmed to reign. Their weakness, being
supported by the power of Caesar, and rendered insolent by the great number of
warlike Vessels, which we see in the Port, will never suffer a courageous and
resolute spirit. They will believe the high virtue of a man of condition too
dangerous for their rising fortune to endure. They will make use of the
ambitious Titles, of Fathers of their Country, and Restorers of the liberty,
which have been given to Andrea Doria, for the oppression of the most
magnanimous, with the pretext of the common good. So that a man of your
courage, under this unjust dominion, is more sure of offenses, then of life:
and if unto this day we have not seen such like things, it is because the power
of Andrea Doria, has not yet attained to its supreme greatness; and that his
moderation has in some sort retained the imperious humor of Jannetin. You know
how insolent he is, how proud, and how insupportable; think then, if when he
shall see himself in an estate of being able to do whatsoever he will, and
followed by young people, who reverence him by reason of his Charge, whether
there be any thing which will not be permitted to his capricious humors? Do you
believe, that a spirit insatiable as his is, will be restrained within the
bounds of Reason? Do you believe, that the desire or thirst of reigning,
exasperated by so certain a hope, can be extinguished but with the blood of
innocents? Do you believe, that content with the power, which Fortune and the
simplicity of our Citizens have given him, he will dye with the sole name of
Jannetin? For me, I do not believe it. His mind is not so moderate, as that he
will, or knows how to contain himself, upon the point of arriving at his last
felicity. He attends, as I conceive, the death of Andrea, which cannot be but
near at hand, that he may follow all his inclinations; and to that effect,
being already in the possession of the hearts of the Nobles, he goes nourishing
the people in idleness, and the gain of commerce, to the end that this
effeminacy depriving them of courage, and being disaccustomed from the exercise
of Arms, they may not dare to resist him, when he shall enterprise any thing;
and by this means he hides a parricidial design under the vail of the public
repose and tranquillity.

But let us presuppose, that the divine providence, for the preservation of
this Republique, should take him off from this dangerous design; the
continuance alone of the rank whereunto he is raised, ought to put shame and
confusion into the hearts of all the other Citizens, whose births are noble.
What reason is there, that in a free Province, so many men of eminent quality,
which yield not unto him, either in nobility, or courage, should live as
private persons, whilst he alone, with the magnificence of a Prince, regards
all the rest as his inferiors, and in such sort, as they seem to depend
absolutely on him? what Law of a well-ordered Republique consents unto it? what
Nation is there, that is not barbarous, which permits it? in what history of
civilized people is any thing seen that authorizes it? If hitherto you have not
in your particular tried the insolency of this haughty humor, it is because
there has no occasion been offered for it; and you know but too well the
thoughts which he has for you: But henceforward you must partake in the
public miseries; yea I do foretell it with grief, that you will be seen, as
others, to visit him, accompany him, serve him, and obey him, as our Sovereign:
and Jannetin Doria shall reckon up amongst the Trophies of his insupportable
temerity, that Giovanni Lodovico, Count of Lavagna, courted him, reverenced
him, and basely crouched under his dominion. O! how fitter were it, that
rouzing up your spirit, at the complaints of an oppressed people; and taking a
resolution worthy of your Country, of your race, and virtue, you would deliver
all your Citizens from this infamy, as well as your self. But it may be that
means would be wanting to you for the execution of this design; contrarily
never thing was more facile. If you turn your eyes toward Rome, you will find
all the succor there, that you can desire. If you seek for protection in
France, the Enemy of Doria cannot fail of encountering a mighty one there. Here
in Genoua, the people, always a foe to Tyranny, will serve you for a sword and
buckler. Jannetin blinded, or rather lulled asleep with his good fortune, will
fall of himself into the nets which you shall lay for him. Your own subjects,
and the Duke of Placentia's, will defend you from all opposition. In fine, all
things invite you to victory, there is nothing wanting, saving only your Will,
not for you to fight, but to triumph. As Andrea Doria made use of the pretext
of liberty to oppress his Country, so do you make use of the pretext of Tyranny
to deliver yours. And consider, that it is absolutely necessary for you, either
to command, or to serve; to render your self dreadful to others, or to live in
continual fear. And since Heaven has given you all that can be desired for so
glorious an enterprise, birth, courage, wit, conduct, and means, be sure to
make a profitable use thereof; and do not render your self worthy of the
servitude that is prepared for you, in neglecting so fair an occasion to avoid
it.

Raphaello Sacco, could not have touched the mind of the Count in a more
sensible part; and this man being born for great matters, was extremely
pleased, in that he could persuade himself, by the reasons alleged unto him,
that he might both together deliver his Country, revenge his own injuries,
destroy his Enemies, content his ambition, and do nothing contrary to glory.
The joy he had of it made him resolve to open his heart to his Confidents;
whereupon he acknowledged unto them, that from his tendrest years, he had felt
a disposition in himself to undertake that which had been now propounded unto
him; that he had ever been an Enemy to Jannetin, though he appeared to be
otherwise; that his insolency was insupportable to him; that having been his
Rival in love, he would be the same in ambition: Then he recounted unto them,
how Andrea Doria would have broken off his marriage; and for a conclusion, he
declared un^o them plainly, that he would change the order of things, and for
that effect crave the protection of France, as being very much inclined to that
Kingdom.

Vincentio Calcagna, seeing how ardently the Count was carried to this design,
and that he spoke of it as of a thing which he had a long time before
determined, was constrained to yield to his temper, which was exceeding
timorous: And though he had promised the Count's Mother all that she had
desired of him, and that all his lifetime he had given l^ssons of Tyranny and
Usurpation to him whom he had brought up, yet seeing the peril so near, and
doubting to be involved in it, and to lose all his fortune, in losing the
Count, whom he he dearly loved; fear made him perform an action of virtue, and
pushed on with zeal and dread, he spoke to the Count much after this manner. If
you be as strongly resolved to attempt some change in the affairs of the State,
as your speech does witness, I may, O my dear Master, rather lam^nt our common
misfortunes, then draw any advantage by contradicting you: but if my good
fortune can make your prudence give some room to second thoughts, which
ordinarily are the intest, you will in this occasion make trial of the ardor
and fidelity which I carry to your service, by the liberty of my discourse, as
you have made trial of my diligence, in the encounters where it has been
necessary unto you. Until now you have lived in so constant a felicity, as it
may be said, you have never seen Fortune displeased; and that is the cause why
your imagination presents none but agreeable objects unto you; that is it which
makes you, according to the custom of the happy, think of nothing but
Victories, Scepters, and Crowns: But I am much afraid lest these deceiving
hopes be not one day destroyed by some fatal event, which w ll be so much the
more insupportable unto you, by how much you have less foreseen it. To go about
to alter any thing in the Government of the Republique, in a time wherein we
are, is an enterprise attended with so many d^fficulties, and exposed to
evident a peril, as I cannot force my mind to figure it unto me certain and
facile, as one would persuade you. For in fine, you will pretend either to make
use of strangers, or to hold intelligence with our Citizens; of the former I
see no likelihood for it: but suppose it were possible, at leastwise the
matter could not be carried with such speed and so secretly, but the City,
Doria, or the Emperor, would have notice of it. Italy, for your ill fortune, is
at this present in so great a trouble, as every ones eyes are open upon his
neighbors affairs: And Genoua it self, by reason of its situation on the brink
of the sea, is guarded as the key of that State. The D^^chy of Milan, which
has been a long time, both a prey and place of battle to the fortune of the
Imperial and French Armies, makes Caesar regard Genoua, as the only defense,
and sole rampart, which covers his power in Italy. Doria also serves the
Emperor with twenty Galleys, but a great deal more with the good will of the
Citizens, who believe they are obliged unto him: Besides this, all the Co^st of
the River of Genoua, especially toward the Levant, is absolutely at his
devotion. The City, that is still much troubled with the Tyranny of the Duke of
Milan, and Government of the French, detests the very name of foreign
dominion. You may indeed with small forces discover your intention, but not
arrive at your end. It is so much the more grievous, that enterprises of this
nature are not favorably judged of, but by their happy success, and that is it
which I do not see you can obtain. For from what part hope you for great
Troops? The King of France, on whose protection you rely, has not so little to
do, in regard of his pretentions to the Kingdom of Naples, and Duchy of Milan,
but if he had even a mind to make some new stir in Italy, that he could come
and succor you with all his forces, which are employed for the safety of his
frontires. But say that he, or any other Prince, should undertake it, could you
believe that the Emperor, who for his own interest takes that of Genoua upon
him, would not oppose them with forces, if not greater, at leastwise equal to
those which you should draw to your assistance? And that being so, you would
see your designs but ill assured, since they would still depend on the loss or
gain of a battle, whose event is always doubtful: but on which side soever the
victory does fall, you are still to follow the pleasure of the conqueror,
nothing being left you that is certain, but the shame of having deprived your
Country of her Liberty, for to submit it to a stranger. But if you turn your
eyes to a nearer succor, by thinking to find it in this City; either I know
not the humor, and inclinations of the Genouesses, or your hopes are but weakly
grounded. Tell me, I pray you, from which sort of our Citizens do you look for
assistance? Will it be from the Nobles? into whose hands Andrea Doria has put
the power and government, and who being obliged to him for the authority they
enjoy, live in an happy and honorable tranquillity, so that no change being
able to arrive, which would not be disadvantageous to them, how would you have
them aid you in an enterprise, which would precipitate them into a more
miserable estate then ever they were? Is it possible, that merely to comply
with you, they should forget their Country, their liberty, their fortunes,
their wives, and their children? Is it possible, that they should prefer your
friendship, before the protection of Doria, whom they reverence as their common
father? No, no, disabuse your self from this error; and believe too, that the
people will not be more favorable unto you, since it is true, that the more
hate they bear to the Nobles, the less will they trust you, who being the most
illustrious amongst them, cannot easily persuade them, that you have no intent
to do them hurt. But grant that some of them could believe it, the Chief of the
popular families would never consent that their welfare should come from your
hand.

Again, if you pretend to usurp the Empire of the Republique, what act can be
farther from meriting the good will of the people? But it may be you will say,
that you will reestablish the first form of Government, changed by Doria, where
the popular authority did all things; and that by the declaration thereof the
multitude will rise for your advantage: For my part, I am not of a contrary
opinion, but believe, as well as you, that those which are ill satisfied will
with joy embrace an occasion of renewing their ancient Tragedies; and so much
the more ardently, for that they shall reap all the profit of it, nothing
remaining for you but shame and infamy. For, for you to imagine, that the
Fregoses and Adornes, who so many years together have fought one against
another, to obtain the prime rank in the administration of the popular affairs,
will yield it to a man of your birth, is a thing which cannot be believed
without clashing with Reason. They will it may be commend your temerity, and
name it valor; they will follow your Colors, as those of their Deliverer; they
will rejoice to see the Noblemen put in chains, by the hand of a Nobleman;
the bowels of their Country torn out by you; the common rest troubled by your
fury; their Tyranny established by your fault: but a time will come when wholly
discharging themselves of the sedition which you have caused, the people will
give them the recompense of your travels, the glory of your enterprise, and the
triumph of your combats. In what terms will you find your self then? Which way
will you turn your self for shame? Detested of the Nobles, whom you shall have
betrayed; despised of the people, who will deride the means which have caused
their utility and your ruin; abominable to your Country, as having ravished
her of her liberty; an Enemy to Caesar, the Protector of the Republique;
suspected of the King of France, who desires to have an absolute power at
Genoua; and hated of all the world, which naturally and reasonably abhors
Treasons.

In fine, I am forced to tell you, and it is necessary that you should
understand it, the extreme love which I bear you permits it me, and my fidelity
enjoins me to it. I fear, I say (and may it please God that my fear may be
vain) that these thoughts of troubles and disquiets be not foretellers of your
bad fortune; which it may be has already resolved the loss of your estate, of
your life and reputation. You know that Jannetin Doria regards you with an eye
of envy, and you your self have oftentimes complained to me of the treacheries
he intended against you; why then will you furnish him with Arms to destroy
you? With what avidity and joy would he embrace the occasion to be revenged of
you, and to content his particular hatred to your person, under the pretext of
the public good? He will rejoice in his heart at this resolution, and excess
of courage, which precipitates you; and taking up Arms openly against you with
all the partakers of his fortune, with what reasons will not he justify his
violenc^s? You shall be the Enemy of the peoples tranquillity; the Tyrant of
the common liberty; a Rebel to the Republique; and the Catiline of Genoua. With
these so just reproaches, and so plausible a Manifest, what one amongst the
people, or amongst the Nobles, of Citizens or Strangers, of private persons or
Princes, that would not arm himself to exterminate you? It is an horror to me,
not only to say it, but to think it. It will be absolutely impossible for you
not to be utterly confounded by the attempts of so many Enemies, as shall
conspire against your life. Your Estate will be confiscated, as the goods of a
Traitor; your memory will be abominable and dishonored in the Annals of
Genoua: and Jannetin, acknowledged for a second D^liverer of his Country, and
Restorer of Liberty, will build his glory on the ruins of yours. We shall see,
it may be, that the gratitude of the Genouesses will erect a Statue to
Jannetin, which shall be placed near to that of Andrea, in the inscription
whereof shall be seen graven the name of Giovanni Lodovico, Count of Lavagna,
the public Enemy, subdued by Jannetin Doria, the Benefactor of his Country.

Now I beseech you, suffer not your self to be carried away by the impetuosity
of age and choler to so evident a peril. Let the pity of your self, of your
family, and of your subjects, arrest you. Remember what you owe to your birth,
to your reputation, to your Country, and to God: Have compassion of the
miseries of your wife; free the minds of those that love you from so just a
fear; consider that your youth, accompanied with so many virtues, ought not to
be so precipitously thrown into the hands of Fortune. Enjoy, enjoy, the
blessings which your Predecessors have left you in so great abundance; and call
to mind, for the extinguishing of your ambition, that you are in so
considerable a rank, which way soever a man regards you, as you may be envyed
even of Jannetin himself. This speech could not be heard of the Count without
emotion; and seeing his design combated with such powerful Reasons, by a man
too of whose affection he was so well assured, he seemed very unquiet and
uncertain, which Baptista Verrin, quickly marking, conceived, that if the
Counts reason had time to fortify it self in that which was good, all the
enterprise would be in doubt.

He began then with an incomparable subtlety and address gently at first to
oppose Vincentio's discourse, as you shall hear, and as I understood it even
from Verrin himself, who afterward recounted all these things to us at
Albengua: Behold then in what manner he spoke. I would to God, said he, that
the affairs of the Republique were brought to that pass, as all our Citizens
might enjoy their estates with tranquillity, I should not then be at this day in
the necessity of wishing you an happier condition, since as Vincentio Calcagna
has well observed, there is never a one in Genoua, either for Riches,
greatness of Estates, or for illustrious Birth, can match you: Neither am I
ignorant, that a wise man ought not to tempt Fortune during an extreme
felicity, in regard it cannot change but to his disadvantage. Howbeit destiny,
the enemy of your good, has in such sort perplexed the State of the
Republique, as you are enforced to attempt something that is great, or to
perish. Jannetin Doria, who for so long a time has regarded the Empire of
Genoua, as the term of his desires and ambition, cannot endure you; and if you
do not see on his brow, and in his eyes, the marks of the extreme hate he bears
you; if by his actions you do not discover the excess of his pride, and his
contempt of your virtue; the Galleys, which you have bought against his will,
may render you a sufficient testimony thereof; and persuade you, that ambition
has its jealousies as well as love; and that Jannetin regarding you as his
Rival, your ruin is one of his most ardent desires. His insolency carries him
so far, as he will be absolute Master of the Sea, and he will not have any man
so much as dare to trouble or divide his power with him: How then will you have
him endure you for a Competitor in the Government of the Commonwealth, since
jealousy, or the desire of reigning, spares neither the blood of brothers, of
children, no not of fathers themselves?

A wicked inclination, and an opiniative humor, as Jannetin's is, cannot be
changed but by violence: you must then, as things stand, either retire
shamefully from Genoua, and abandoning your Galleys to him, declare him
victorious, in leaving him Master of the field, or rouse up that spirit and
courage in you, which is to surmount him. But if nevertheless you be resolved
to decline this peril with infamy, and to preserve your life, as having
received it of grace from the hand of your enemy; I am willing, I consent to
it, and will no longer oppose it; though it be the most deplorable estate,
wherein even the hatred of Jannetin can wish you. But if your virtue do not
deceive my hopes, in making me attend some greater and more generous thing from
you, I shall see this rash man surmounted by your valor, and his pride wholly
subjected to your courage. It is for you then to attempt an enterprise, which
is so glorious, as even Jannetin himself will envy you for it. Fortune has set
between you two the whole Empire of Liguria; and the one cannot vanquish the
other to mount into the Throne, but by passing the Charet of his Triumph over
the body of his enemy. He alone shall best assure to himself the victory, who
can first prevent his enemy dexterously, by taking from him the means of
outstripping him. It is a necessity common to you both, for each of you to
think of your conservation; and he shall be the wisest, that with the diligence
of a speedy execution shall mock at his enemies sloth, in oppressing him
without resistance. In fine, prepare your self to assault, or to be assaulted;
to lay ambushes for your enemy, or to fall into the pit which he has dug
for you; to put him to death, or to suffer death your self. It may be this
speech will seem harsh to the prudent Calcagna, but necessity, which in the
most desperate affairs augmenteth valor and courage, serves also to justify
the violentest actions, when the cause thereof is just, and in these occasions
it may be named the buckler of innocence. Let the temerity of Jannetin, the
baseness of the Genouesses, and the injustice of Fortune, which have forced you
to this inevitable mischief, be accused for this enterprise. You do no body
injury, when you defend your self, but only follow the ordinary Laws of Nature.

It is prudence to divert upon the head of our enemy the tempest which would
overwhelm us: And if that cannot be done without some appearance of evil, the
fault shall not be yours, but destinies, which leaves you no other mean to
preserve your life, but by the death of your adversary, nor will not let your
virtue be able to defend it self without a crime. But what say I, a crime I
this word is for you, O too prudent Calcagna; you have learned it no doubt in
the School of the Vulgar, who know not the politic of Conquerors. With such
like terms the actions of private persons are spoken of, but not those of the
Great: And if your Rule were true, it might be said that all Empires were
Robberies, because there is none of them which was not established by that
natural right, which the strong impose on the weak.

Nature brought men into the world with an equality of all things, and yet left
unto Virtue the power of raising them, which possess it, to the glory of
reigning over others: From whence it comes, that the most part of those, who
are Princes or Masters of the Earth, carry not that title, but because their
Predecessors, by the address and by force of Arms, usurped the Empire over
their equals. I do not deny but that there are some persons, who as well as
Vincentio will blame your resolution, before it be conducted to its end, in
regard all hardy and dangerous actions are never commended till they are
executed; but as soon as the happy success of the event shall have justified
and authorized the greatness of your enterprise, the blame will be turned into
admiration; and that which was called temerity and imprudence, will be termed
valor and greatness of courage. As long as the first of the Caesar's was in Arms
against Pompey, and that the Roman Empire was the cause of their conflicts, he
had not only Pompey for an adversary, but even all the Nobility were his most
cruel foes. In the mean time as soon as he had defeated his Enemies mighty Army
in the plains of Pharsalia, and that this victory had put him in full
possession of the Roman Empire, all the hatred which was born him ceased; and
he was so dearly and ardently beloved of the Romans, as this affection could
not finish with his life, but they punished his death with a memorable revenge.
Resolve then to suffer the Genouesses for a time to call you Tyrant, and do not
take this name as a grievous injury, seeing it shall be the last insolency of
their dying liberty. They will accustom themselves afterward to acknowledge you
for their lawful Prince, and as such reverence you. Behold how much I rely on
your fortune, in speaking to you of the felicities of your Empire, before you
have resolved to fight for the acquiring of it. But things are disposed in such
sort, as you may sooner be wanting to your self, then the Empire to your
virtue. For if the difficulties be great, according to Vincentio's opinion,
your courage is yet greater. Let us grant him, that the enterprise is dangerous
and difficult; in what History, ancient or modern, has it been found, that the
way which conducteth to glory is covered with flowers? and that an illustrious
action has been executed without pain? All great designs have always been
followed by great perils; and all high places are ever near to precipices: A
generous man will not for all that let the fear of an uncertain evil, make him
a prey to an inevitable servitude. Amongst private persons it is an effect of
prudence to be contained within mediocrity; but in affairs of State all
resolutions are to be extreme, the rest being dangerous, especially in
enterprises, which begin not to break forth but by their execution. For it
being then no longer in our power to retain the thing, we must of necessity
arrive at the end we have proposed to our selves, or fall in the midst of the
course, and be utterly lost. Yet let us not make so unhappy a presage of our
designs, but let us forecast the misfortunes which may arrive to us, not to
torment our selves in the expectation of them, but by prudence to take from
them the power of hurting us. We are to be guided with precaution, but yet not
so far, as that extreme wisdom may thereby render us more timorous and
viresolute. You must, generous Count, give something to the conduct of Fortune,
who having chosen you for the Deliverer of Genoua, and Restorer of the ancient
Italian valor, will know well enough how to find out the means to plain all
difficulties before you. It is she that calls you to glory; it is she that will
conduct you to it; only consent to your good fortune, and with an open heart
receive the Crown which fate presents you with, nor sharing it with any one.
For to what end would it serve you to call in the French to the sharing of your
glory? whereas that Nation, having lost their credit in Italy, as well as their
States, would hurt you more, then they could help you. The example of Andrea
Doria should keep you sufficiently from it: He had served them with exceeding
affection, and to their great profit, in the mean time you know how he was
entreated.

And then again, what recompense could the French ever give you, that might be
worthy of your labors? It may be they will leave you Governor in Genoua, with
the dependances which they use to exact of their Subjects; but that would be to
render you mercinary in a place, where Nature has given you part in the
Dominion. If any resistance should be made by the Emperor, or by the City it
self, against your designs, with what forces could they come and succor you,
being in a Country so far distant from ours, and so taken up with their own
affairs. Verily you are to make use of your Subjects, of your Friends, and of
your Confederates. And why will you not with so generous a Troop undertake to
set this Crown upon your head, which is as worthy of you, as you are worthy of
it? When as your power shall be established in Genoua, which may be said to be
the Key of all Italy on the Seacoast, the chiefest Kings of Christendom will
seek for your alliance and amity with care. The envy of your Competitors being
surmounted, the family of the Counts of Lavagna will be in a state, whereunto
no person in Genoua ever yet arrived. It will lie in your hands to be revenged
of those enemies that despised your youth; Jannetin himself, yea Jannetin
Doria, your mortal enemy, shall fall spite of his teeth at your feet, to crave
pardon of you; He shall reverence you as his Lord; he shall fear you as a
Prince; his actions shall be accommodated to your pleasure; your will shall
rule his desires; and on you alone shall his life or death depend. Let the
French then keep themselves in their Kingdom, and from thence only let them
hear the fame of your Victories. It is for you alone to surmount all the
Obstacl^s which may be opposed to your generous designs. Undertake it then with
a confidence worthy of your birth, and of your courage; merit by this action
the triumph which Heaven has destined to you. Let all the world learn that you
knew how to be the illustrious and sole Artisan of your fortune. Surpass the
hopes which I have of you, although they be very great: and to say all, assure
the Empire to your family, and Eternity to your name.

Baptista Verrin had no sooner made an end of speaking, but Raphaello Sacco
affected to France, and Vincentio Calcagna pushed on by his timidity, by the
fear of losing that repose which he had enjoyed all his life time, and by the
affection which he bore to the Count, opposed themselves once more against
Baptista. The first would have had nothing undertaken without the succor of the
French; and the other would have had nothing undertaken at all. But Baptista
for his own interest would be sure not to yield in this occasion: He saw, that
as long as the Government was in the hands of the Nobility, he should never
pretend to have any part in the sway thereof. And then again, he had brought
his affairs into so strange a disorder, by the debts which he had run into, as
judging that he could hardly conceal his misery longer, if the tranquillity of
the Republique should last any time, he was desirous to steal it from the eyes
of the world by a universal confusion. He considered also, that if the
enterprise were prosperous, he should raise his fortune to an high pitch; that
it contrarily the su^cess of it should be infortnate, his ruin being
accompanied with that of others, and dying in his endeavoring the execution of
a great design, it would be some comfort to him to think that the infamy of his
name would pass unto posterity; so true it is, that the ambition of men is so
unreasonable, as to make them oftentimes to put no difference between good and
bad fame, provided it be great.

Baptista then opposed himself with a great deal of vehemence against their
Reasons that appugned his, and told the Count, that it was a thing unworthy of
a noble Soul, to let himself be vanquished by fear, or to say better, by
Chimera's. He represented unto him, that the Garrison of Genoua consisted of no
more then two hundred Soldiers; that Doria's Galleys, though many in number,
would be unprofitable for his defense, so as the time of execution were chosen,
when as they were disarmed, at their return from scouring the Seas, which they
usually did every year; that Andrea and Jannetin, far from all suspicion, lived
without any particular Guard, and in a confidence which would be very
commodious to them; that it would be easy for him to draw into Genoua a good
number of selected men, and taken out of the Lands of his obedience, who on a
sudden should go and seize upon Doria in his own Palace; and that at the very
same time it would be facile to render himself Master of the Galleys; that the
hatred of the people against the Nobles would make an end of the rest of the
enterprise, and give it an happy success. He offered for his own particular to
get the Citizens to rise in favor of this design; assuring him, that by his
means they were wholly disposed already to rebellion. With such like Reasons,
which Verrin amplified with a great deal of address, he became Master of the
Counts mind, who plainly testified that he determined, either to perish, or to
reign. And after he had made known, that nothing could alter his resolution, he
said unto Raphaello Sacco, who had persuaded him to the business under the
pretext of the public good, Heaven is my witness, that if I did not believe I
should make my Country more happy under my Command, then it is under the
Tyranny of them that oppress it, I would choose rather to dye, then to attempt
that which I am going to undertake.

This speech ended, they all resolved with one accord, that since the
Government could not be changed without the death of Andrea and Jannetin Doria,
they were chiefly to think of giving such order to the matter, as the end of
their lives should be the beginning of the execution thereof. This Conspiracy
being made, the Count went out of his Cabinet, with a marvelous tranquillity of
spirit, and we were all the evening with him, talking of Music and Painting,
as if he had hid nothing else of importance in his thought. As for his
Counselors, they told her who had employed them, that she was to attend great
matters from her son, without particularizing any thing unto her, for fear lest
she should discover them. In the mean time, the Count, having certain days
after taken great care for the Galleys, which he had bought not long before,
used to go oftentimes to the places belonging to him; where with an admirable
Providence he furnished his Subjects with Arms, and made them to exercise them,
upon pretext of being in some fear of the Duke of Placentia, whose neighbor he
was; but indeed, it was to render them capable of serving him in his design.

The end of Autumn being come, he return d to Genoua, and applied all his care
to gain the good will of all the young men, of those families newly ennobl^d,
which are called Popular. He introduced himself into their conversation with a
marvelous compliance. He sent p^esents to some, he served others according to
occasions, and offered himself to all, with an extraordinary courtesy. And
whereas he had a quick and pleasing wit, and a supple and charming humor, he
won their affection in so high a manner, as he was their Master, rather then
their friend. When as he knew that he might begin to confide in them, and that
their wills depended absolutely on his, he fell to jeering, as occasion served,
at the Government of Genoua, which he termed the Tyranny of the Nobles.
Sometimes he testified with interrupted speeches that he suffered in the
miseries of the popular families; sometimes he seemed to tell them that the
matter was not past remedy, and that they might abase the pride of the Nobles,
if their hearts did not fail them; som^times also with a bitter scoff he
exhorted them to servitude; yet still leaving them a sting behind in their
minds by his doubtful and uncertain words. And above all things, he aggravated
the injustice of the Government, when by chance any accident fell out, that
displeased the popular families. But if he were agreeable to them, he had
rendered himself no less pleasing to the common people, by such means as he had
c^refully used for it. He most readily saluted some, he sm^led upon others as
he met them, he was magnificent in his apparel, gentle and courteous to every
one; and that which advanced his design more was, as you know as well as I,
that he was wonderful handsome, and of an exceeding jovial humor; that the air
of his face was sweet and agreeable; and his carriage so noble, so free, and so
fair, as one was forced to love him at the very first sight. He exercised
himself also in fencing, and riding of the great horse, and that with so
gallant a grace, and so great an address, as they that saw him could not choose
but love a man, who gave them so much delight.

But whereas liberality is the strongest chain, wherewith the people may be
captivated, he met with no occasion of demonstrating his unto them, but he
testified it with a magnificence past compare. Yet would not our prudent
Conspirator cast himself so absolutely into the hands of the people, as to
minister any jealousy thereby to the Nobles; but he used so just a temper in a
conjuncture, where mediocrity was so hard to be observed, that the good will of
the one did not make him lose the friendship of the others. And to that effect,
though Jannetin was become very insolent, since Caesar had admitted him for
Generalissimo after the death of Andrea; though he would be no longer followed
by young men but for interest; though he would be no longer served but for
fear; though his arrogance had even carried him to offer some ill usage to the
Count; yet began he not only to go oftener to Andrea then he was wont, and to
show a more particular reverence to him, but shutting up also in h^s heart the
hatred which he bore to Jannetin, he conversed often with him, and demanded
counsel and assistance of him in his affairs. And because that in times past
the love of Leonora had put them at odds with one another, he used great care
to take from him the memory thereof.

In the mean time, he had treated secretly with the Duke of Placentia, who had
promised him two thousand Foot, to join with two thousand others, which he had
picked forth out of all his subjects, for the service of his enterprise when
time should serve. He had also caused one of his Galleys to come to Genoua
under pretext that he meant to send her forth to scour the Seas all along the
Coast of Barbary. Howbeit during all this we observed as a most extraordinary
thing in him, that he was as merry as he used to be, delighted as much in our
company, and seemed to have no other greater thought, then of being agreeable
to his friends.

Now Baptista, cunning and undertaking as he was, remained not idle; for in a
very short time he had gained a great number of persons, who promised to follow
and serve him faithfully in a secret design which he said he had. With these
preparations, they believed that they had laid foundations solid enough for the
execution of their intentions; and being assembled together to take their last
resolution, the advice of Baptista Verrin was, that whereas there was a
ceremony to be celebrated for the performance whereof every one would resort
unto the Church, he would have them begin the executing of the business in that
place, offering to give Jannetin the first stab. But the Count's piety being
unable to consent to this proposition, he made a step or two back, crying out,
He would never endure that the beginning of his enterprise should be a
profanation and a sacriledg. Raphaello Sacco added thereunto, that the matter
likewise would even be as uncertain, as it was execrable; because Andrea Doria
might excuse himself upon the incommodity of his age, and so not come, but send
Philippo Doria his Kinsman in his stead. To this Verrin answered again, that if
they thought it fit he would go, whilst they were executing the business, to
Andrea's Palace, and under color of visiting him as he was wont to do, he
would strike him to the heart with his Poignard. But the Count being very angry
with him for it, he gave this over, and propounded another expedient worthy of
his wit: He told the Count, that Jannetin's sister being shortly after to marry
with Julio Cibo, Leonora's brother, he would have him desire them to sup at his
house; and to render the feast the more magnificent, he should also invite
Andrea Doria and Jannetin, together with a great number of Ladies, and all such
amongst the Nobles, whom they might judge were most to be feared for the
execution of their design; That things being thus, it would be easy for them
whom they had hid for that purpose to kill them; that presently thereupon the
Count, followed by his friends, should go through all the streets of Genoua,
sounding out the sweet name of Liberty, and acquainting the people that their
chains were broken; That in this Tumult the Palace was to be seized upon and
secured; that in the mean time he would possess the people with the Count's
generous designs, concealing from them with address that which he had of
absolutely reigning; and letting them know the necessity of reforming the
Government, or to say better, the cruel Tyranny of the Nobles, for so it was
that he spoke; That for this effect he would crown him Duke of the Republique,
and cause them whom he had gained to take the oath of allegiance unto him; That
if any one, either in word or deed, should contradict them, he should be
killed upon the place.

The Count found this plot indifferently well contrived, but yet he felt an
extreme repugnancy in resolving to violate the law of hospitality, in killing
men in his house, whom he had entreated thither; but being persuaded that he
should not meet with a better mean to arrive to his end, he resolved for it:
And to that purpose, he commanded, that the Soldiers, which he had chosen from
amongst his Subjects, should come one by one into Genoua; And on the other side
he solicited the Duke of Placentia to send him the succor which he had
promised him. All these dispatches could not be so secretly made, especially
having to do with a levy of men of war, but that Don Fernando de Gonzagua, who
had succeeded to the Marquis of Guast, and commanded at that time in the Duchy
of Milan, was advertised thereof. For whereas he was vigilant for the security
of the State, which had been entrusted to his conduct, he had carefully set
spies to observe the least motions of the neighboring Provinces, especially of
the Princes that were suspected to him; so that he was soon informed by men,
that were as dextrous as faithful, whom he had employed for that effect, that
the Duke of Placentia had levied in his State two thousand Soldiers with
extraordinary haste for the Count of Lavagna; and conjecturing by the silence
and secrecy, which was used in this affair, that there was some great design a
plotting, he sent with all speed to Genoua, to advise Doria, and Don Gomes
Suarez, the Emperors Ambassador there, to stand upon their guard, because the
young Count of Lavagna was conspiring some great matter.

Andrea received this advice, without grounding any thing thereupon; for he was
so strongly persuaded of the Count's affection to him, and so powerfully
assured, by the tranquillity which he always saw in his face, that he had no
bad design in hand, as this discourse made no kind of impression in his mind;
and to confirm him in his incredulity, the Count entered accidently into
Andrea's chamber, when as the Ambassador and he were speaking of this affair;
but he appeared with so clear a countenance, and talked to them with so much
judgment, and liberty of spirit, that Andrea Doria, charmed with his
conversation, and persuaded of his innocence, approached to the Ambassador, and
said to him softly in his ear, as we have learned since, Judge you your self,
whether this Princely look, this both modest and confident carriage, this noble
and quiet soul, and this liberty of spirit, can be capable of so horrible a
conspiracy? The Ambassador not able to gainsay Andrea's Opinion, made a sign to
him that he was of his mind. And albeit that two days after Doria had a second
advertisement, yet the Count's address was so great, as his sight alone
destroyed whatsoever was said against him. And so wonderful was his conduct,
that Andrea Doria, above fourscore years of age, and held for one of the
greatest politicians of his time, was beguiled by a man of two and twenty.

The generous Pansa, who had been of none of the Count's counsels, was without
comparison more advised. For whereas he joined affection to prudence, it was
the more easy for him to suspect something of the truth. He had exactly
observed all the Count's actions, ever since he had bought the Galleys of the
Duke of Placentia; and carefully examining all that he had seen or heard in
diverse occasions, he found that he had cause to fear lest the Count had some
dangerous design a foot. He saw how he, who was accustomed to communicate the
most important affairs of his house to him, talked no longer with him but of
indifferent things; that he was often in a retired and private conversation
with Baptista Verrin, and having followed him sometimes when as he withdrew
himself into his Cabinet, he had perceived him to be musing and melancholique:
For though the Count seemed to be merry, when as he might be seen of any body,
and by that artifice admirably covered the designs which he had in his heart,
yet was he no sooner retired in private, but he became quite another then what
he had been seen abroad, which Pansa alone had marked, for he had concealed
himself from Leonora, as well as from others. That which kept the Count from
communicating his design to Pansa, was his knowledge of the affection and
exceeding prudence of the man, so that he was assured he would have opposed his
design, or at leastwise have counseled him not to have undertaken it so
precipitously; and would have had him seek for more security in an enterprise,
where none had ever been.

At length, one day when as the Count returned to his Palace more melancholique
then he used to be, carrying in his face some marks of an extraordinary
unquietness, and with such a paleness, as amazement many times paints on the
forehead of those, which are upon the point of executing some great design,
whose event is but ill-assured; the generous Pansa followed him to his Cabinet,
and resolved to tell him his suspicions, for fear lest if he should longer
defer to do it, there would be no time left for the remedying of the evil
whereof he was afraid. After he had shut the door, then he addressed his speech
to the Count, who leaning on a Table, heard him with a great deal of
unquietness. I know very well, my Lord, said he unto him, that one merits to be
as much blamed, for enquiring into the secrets of another, as one ought to be
esteemed, for fidelity in concealing them, when they are entrusted unto us;
wherefore mine being known by so many proofs which I have rendered unto you of
it, I have believed, that it was for you to discover your minds unto me, and
for me not to do any thing that might displease you. But now that the trouble
of your eyes does justify my suspicions, and redouble my unquietness, I learn
to fear by the fear which I discern in your face, that doubtless betrays your
thoughts; Yes, my dear Master, I fear, and am not able to tell you what it is I
fear; howb^it I know very well that it is an effect of the love I bear you, and
an excess of my fidelity, which puts me into doubt; but I know also, that my
fear is not without probability. For how can I be persuaded that that which you
are premeditating is glorious and honorable, if it has the power to trouble
the tranquillity of your Soul? Believe me, the execution of the matter you are
thinking of, can be neither very assured, nor very facile, since the only
imagination thereof disquiets you. Let this fatal presage arrest you, and know,
that all the enterprises which are commenced with this repugnancy and
pensiveness, whereof I behold the marks in your face, have never or seldom any
prosperous success. Make profit then of the interior advertisements, which
Heaven sends you. I do not press you to tell me the secret, which you will not
have me to know, though I may presume to ask of you, why you retain me about
you, if my faith be suspected to you, and that you no longer judge me worthy of
your confidence? But only tell me, what object and what end can the
conversation of these men have, who always leave you so sad and unquiet, as I
never saw you so before. Alas! how do I fear, lest these secret counsels,
which you hold so often with these violent persons, and whose inclinations are
not very sincere, should by their address and cunning draw you out of the way
of virtue! Suffer me, my dear Master, to discover the disease that I may cure
it. They, from whom my suspicions arise, are not of such commendable manners,
or of so exemplary a piety, as I may believe they give you counsels, which do
not clash either with Virtue, or with Religion. It may be they abuse your
little experience, and knowing you generous they propound unto you actions,
which in appearance are great and glorious, but which in effect are rash and
vain. Open your eyes then, O noble Count, and think that an inconsiderate man
may make you fall into a precipice, out of which the prudence of all the wisest
in the world cannot draw you. It is easy enough to set a Palace on fire, but
it is not so easy to quench it: Take heed lest they that counsel you do not
make use of you, to arrive at the end which they propose unto themselves; and
that your undoing do not serve for the benefit of them which deceive you. It is
rare to meet with men, who counsel that which is good, because it is good,
without regard to their interest; and yet it is by this experience, that we are
to be secured of them. Examine then seriously, whether they, which counsel you,
cannot become greater or richer by that they would have you undertake. And to
tell you all that I think in this occasion, I cannot be persuaded, that they,
which spend their lives amongst crimes, are capable of persuading virtue unto
others. For though there be great difference between deeds and words, the most
important part of persuasion consists in example rather then in discourse; and
commonly the mouth and the hand act alike. What would these men have of you? To
what innovation would they carry you? The estate of your affairs are at such a
point, as they have no need of change; there can no mutation arrive unto you,
but will be to your disadvantage. Envy has a long time sought to fasten on
you, and will you let her take hold on you by the disorder whereunto they are
carrying you? For you are not ignorant, how there is a great number of persons,
who are inferior to you, both in Nobility, Estate, and Virtue, which endevor to
traduce you. I know that hope is sweet unto young people, especially to them
which can sustain it with the greatness of their courage, but I know withal
that nothing is more slippery then prosperity: Beware then lest the hope of an
uncertain thing do not make you lose an assured good. They which counsel you
have nothing to lose, nor nothing to hazard, whether their means or their
reputation be considered; and therefore it is, that these kind of men wish for
revolts, seditions, tumults, and disorders, because it is the custom of such
like persons to enrich themselves with other men's losses, and to find their
particular rest in a general confusion. In fine, they which are not very high,
fear not falling; but you are to deal otherwise: For you are not only obliged
to conserve the blessings, which Heaven has committed to you, as it were in
trust, but you are also obliged out of a sense of honor to give occasion unto
fame, by the generosity of your actions, to publish, that you are the worthy
successor of so many great men which have preceded you.

The Count heard the generous Pansa with a great deal of impatience; he told
him for all that in g^n^ral terms, that all his designs being great and noble,
he should be assured he would do nothing unworthy of h^s birth; and having
embraced him very tenderly, he left him, after he had conjured him not to say
any thing to Leonora of his unquietness. In the mean time the Count and his
Confederates impatiently attended the day of that fatal feast, which was to be
the fourth of January, for the executing of their design. But they were
constrained to hasten the business, because Andrea Doria, having been taken
with a fit of the gout, that was accompanied with a fever, was not in case to
keep his promise for being there: and Jannetin being to part from Genoua about
a very pressing affair, the Count did thereupon judge, that it would be
superfluous for him, to attend the day of the feast, since the two principal
sacrifices, which were to be offered, would not be present there. And
considering further that the greatest obstacle of Conspirators is always
retardment, they resolved on the second of January at night for the execution
of their design. And to that effect the Count began to publish that he had a
determination to send one of his Galleys against the Pirates; for that the Pope
having allowed him entertainment but for three of them, he would have the other
bring him in wherewithal to defray the charge he was at with her. Upon this
pretext, and by this artifice, he caused a great part of the Soldiers, which
had been sent him from Placentia to enter into Genoua; saying, that out of them
he would make choice of the strongest and ablest men. And lest the number of
those which came from his Lands, who were far more then were needful for a
Gally, should give any suspicion, he made a great many of them to be led in
chained, as Malefactors destined to the Oar; and caused the rest to enter in
one after another through several gates, after they were well furnished with
Arms. And the better to beguile Jannetin, he entrusted him with the design
which he said he had for the sending of his Gally to scour the Seas, desiring
him so to deal with Andrea, as he might give no impediment unto it; fearing
(said he) lest the obligation wherein the Republique stood engaged to Soliman
by the means of Justiniano, should keep Andrea from permitting it. Jannetin
promised him all that he desired, and kept his word with him.

In the mean time the second of January being arrived, which preceded that
dreadful night, the Count caused certain Soldiers of the Garrison to come to his
Palace, whereof some were his Subjects, and the rest such as had been placed
there by him, and having left them under the Command of one of the
Conspirators, he went and past away the rest of the day till evening with
Andrea Doria, where he had never been seen more merry, or more pleasant. He
entreated Jannetin again, who was there present, to give order at the Port,
that his Gally; which was that night to set sail toward the Archipelague,
might not be stayed. He advertised him also, that he would not be troubled, if
he heard any noise, or any Ordnance discharged; for, as you know better then I,
said he unto him, they always shoot off some for the Ceremony of parting, and
these things never pass without some stir. At his coming from thence the French
Marquess and I met him; but it had been hard for us to foresee what the Count
had in his thought; for he talked to us of nothing but of matches of sport and
delight for the ensuing days; Howbeit he gave us dexterously to understand, that
he should be busy this evening in setting forth his Gally, for fear lest we
should go home with him, seeming nevertheless very sorry at it, and telling us
that Leonora and Sophronia would not be friends with him for it. After we were
parted from him, he went to his Palace, which, as you know, was in that part of
Genoua, called Carignan, and which seems to be severed from all the rest of the
City, and to command it, as well for its advantageous situation, as for its
magnificence. You know also, that this Palace, being built upon a little hill,
touched the walls of the City almost on every side; The Sea was in the face of
the building, and backwards it had for prospect the pleasant Valley of Bisagno.
I put you in mind of these things, that you may comprehend, how this Palace,
being as it were an Island, was very commodiously situated for the Counts
enterprise; having no nearer a neighbor then Baptista, who being of the
Conspiracy was not to be feared. In fine, being returned home, he drew thither
about the beginning of the night, a great many of armed men, of those which he
had caused to enter secretly into the City, and of those which he had suborned
even in Genoua it self. He placed them for the Guard of the Gates of his
Palace, whom he held to be the most courageous and faithful; with order to
leave the entrance thereinto free to every one, but to let no body pass out of
them.

In the mean time one of the Captains of the Garrison, going to set Sentinels,
perceived that some of the Soldiers were missing, and enquired of his
Lieutenant whither they were gone; whereupon some of their fellows answering
that they were gone to Carignan with the Count of Lavagna, it made him suspect
something; so that he went instantly and gave notice thereof to the Senators
that were at the Palace, and to Andrea Doria; and then it was that the Counts
dissimulation wrought the greatest effect, and began to produce that which he
had expected from it. Jannetin hearing this advertisement, told him, that his
fidelity was to be commended, although this advice had no ground for them to
fear any thing. For whereas he was prepossest by the Counts address, who had
demanded permission of him for the parting away of a Gally this night to scour
the Seas toward the Levant, he assured them that all these Soldiers, which
were gone to him, being of his own or the Duke of Placentia's Subjects, were
destined to that purpose; and that those, which were said to be at Carignan,
were gone thither to take their farewell of some of their friends. With such
like discourses, Jannetin made the rest give over their suspicions, and he
himself served the design of his Enemy.

This while the Count, after he had given order for all things necessary at
home, went to two or three of those assemblies, which are made a nights in the
houses of persons of quality in Genona, where the small time that he stayed
there, he left a new admiration of his wit. He was magnificently apparelled
that day, and redoubling also his ordinary civility and gallantry, he went not
out of any of those companies without augmenting the affection which they
already bore unto him. But at last he went to the house of one, named Assereto,
where he found three and twenty young Gentleman of the Popular order, whom the
cunning of Baptista Verrin had drawn thither. The Count caressed them
exceedingly, and talking with them of diverse things, and supper time being
near, he desired them to go home and eat with him. He told them, that it was
too fair an evening to part so soon; that the night was too light, and the Moon
too clear, for them to excuse themselves upon the season; and briefly, he
entreated them with so good a grace, as they went along with him. The Count led
them to a back room, willing the discreet Pansa to go and entertain his wife,
unto whom he would come ere it were long, because, said he smiling, our design
will not brook the presence of Ladies. At first these young Gentlemen believed,
that it was to treat them with the more liberty he did so, and so went on with
him. In the mean time Baptista Verrin went dexterously to see if he could
discover any thing about the Palace, or at Doria's, that might make him think
they were suspected.

Things being in these terms, the Count entered into another chamber, after he
had told them, that he would come to them again presently, as indeed he stayed
not long before he returned. But they were mightily surprised, when as they saw
him enter completely armed, and followed by two hundred Soldiers, with
Partisans or Muskets, which ranged themselves round about him; He had his
Viser up, and his Sword in his hand; and beginning then to let the hatred and
choler break forth, which he had for so long a time kept concealed in his
heart, his face was all on fire, and fierceness and fury appeared in his eyes.
He approached to a Table, and leaning on it with his left hand, he continued a
while without saying any thing; then suddenly giving a great bounce on it, he
said with an imperious tone, and a precipitate voice, It is done, I am
resolved, O conragious and illustrious friends! a spirit touched with any
generosity can no longer suffer it; the insolency of them that would oppress us
has incensed my courage, and wearied my patience. My imagination presents unto
me a spectacle, too horrible and too deadly, in making me see our Citizens
tyrannized, and the subversion of our Country indubitable, for me not to oppose
my self to a mischief, which fear, or to say better, Reason, makes me see so
nigh at hand. If the evils, wherewith the Republique is mortally tainted, could
hope for remedies from time, I would endure, as others do, a retardment, which
might be profitable to the public good; but since we are arrived at the last
period of our misery, and that we see our selves quite ready to be ruined, we
must of necessity go and encounter that which is to overwhelm us: and if it be
possible, not only sustain, but overthrow it. How great soever the peril is, it
loses much of its force, when it is courageously affronted; whereas contrarily,
it increases and becomes inevitable when it is attended with patience.

Jannetin Doria weary of that idle felicity which follows him, dreams of
nothing but of contenting his ambition; and seeing his pernicious designs, so
near to be executed, his whole thought is bestowed in contriving my death, and
your servitude. It was not enough for this ambitious man to see the people of
Genoua dispoiled of the Empire of Liguria, and submited to be the object of the
contempt of the Nobles, but he must enterprise also to render himself
tyrannically Sovereign of you: yea, more barbarous then Strangers have been
unto us, so great a pride is there seen in his heart, as cannot be vanquished
by patience, nor avoided by humility. And to secure himself of you, he holds
you besieged on the Seaside with twenty Galleys, which in the midst of an
apparent peace are in the Port, more for your ruin then for your safety. We
see him always going through the City, environed with Nobles, who by the favor
of Andrea, having usurped the Commands which appertained unto you, render unto
Jannetin, for a recompense of your infamy, an honor unworthy both of them and
of him. But that which touches me further, is, that I certainly know how under
the authority of a Prince he prepares an heavy yoke for the public liberty.
And because I have without considering my birth embraced your cause, not so
much for the interest of your order, as for following of Reason, and satisfying
of my duty; because, I say, I have never consented to the insolent contempt,
which the Nobles have used toward all them that are not of their body; because
I have esteemed of virtue wheresoever I have met with it; because I have always
taken part with Equity, without considering that their interests were in some
sort mine; they attempt upon my life, and believe that they cannot put you into
chains, unless they d^prive you of him, whom they conceive to be strong enough,
or courageous enough, to undertake the breaking of them.

What do we mean then, O my companions, by our sloth and our cowardice? Will we
be always the Spectators of our own misery? For what enterprise shall we
reserve our courage, if in the general desolation of our Country we abandon our
selves? It is no time for us longer to complain of our Enemies, but to revenge
our selves of them. Let us leave the use of tears to our wives, and if we be
worthy the name of men, which we bear, let us employ our courage, our force,
and our address, in destroying our Tyrants. We have too much already endured
their insolency, which doubtless carries them to believe, that our patience is
an effect of our faint-heartedness. They who leave crimes unpunished, are
guilty of those, which the excess of their goodness does make their oppressors
commit afterward; who ordinarily augment their violences, when as they see
they are dissembled. What do we further expect, O generous Citizens? May it be,
to have the Government, and all kind of Authority in the Republique to be
utterly lost? May it be, that you will have the heart to place Jannetin in the
Throne? To see the Ministers of his fury go and take your goods out of your
houses, ruin your families, attempt upon your lives, dishonor your wives, and
commit those wickednesses, which may justly be attended from a Tyranny, that is
born for the ruin of the Country, nourished by the public dissension,
increased by the miseries of the Citizens, and established by the death of so
many good men? Are our courages so base, and so low brought? Have our swords so
little edg, as we cannot cut off the infamous life of him, who makes a glory of
our shame, who triumphs over our misfortunes, and feeds on our miseries? Shall
we not pluck out of Jannetin's body that cowardly heart, which has contrived
so many Treasons, and which may be termed the scource of all our mischiefs?
Shall we suffer a simple Citizen to be our Tyrant, let him trample us under his
feet, and subjecting us unto him as his Slaves, dispose of our lives and deaths
as he pleases? For me, I profess freely unto you, that I hold it more glorious
to buy liberty with a great peril, then to sweeten servitude with idleness and
patience. And as I take it for a glory, that our Enemies have a design to add
the loss of my life unto that of the Republique, so do I consecrate my life
with joy for the liberty of my Coun^ry, acknowledging that I should be unworthy
of enjoying it, if I could prefer it before the public utility. I desire
only, O illustrious Citizens, to discover a resolution in you, if not worthy of
your courage, at leastwise proportionable to the danger wherein you are. In
fine, whether you will have me for a Soldier, or a Captain; if you will go
before me, I will follow you, if I shall go before you, do you follow me.
Besides, whether you be sensible of honor, or that you only think of your
safety, you are always forced to take up Arms: for since I must deliver things
unto you as they are, this resolution, as to generous men, is glorious for you,
as to men of little courage is commodious for you, and in what manner soever it
be, is necessary for you. I do not call you to an enterprise, that is
unforecasted or ill conducted, I have long since considered the end and means
of it: And I have not only examined the sequel of it, but I have assembled
troops for it, and having distributed them in the most commodious places for
execution, it is rather inviting you to the pleasing spectacle of a certain
victory, then to the peril of a doubtful fight.

But without animating you by the hope of that is to come, I know very well, so
as you will call to mind the outrages of the Nobles, and the insolency of
Jannetin, I know very well, I say, that the desire of revenge being rouzed up
in your Souls, you will come to fight with so much heart, as our Enemies shall
to their damage admire the valor of those whom they despised; and you on the
contrary shall know by your own experience, whether they have as much force in
warlike occasions, as they have weakness in abandoning themselves to
voluptuousness in the time of Peace. Let us go then, generous Citizens, and let
this be the end of my discourse, and the beginning of your victory. Let us go
out of this Palace, and descend into the City, where we are attended by a great
number of our friends, for the ending of an enterprise so well begun. The gates
are in the power of the Soldiers, whom I have gained to me, the Galleys upon a
Signal given will fall into the hands of a Troop of men, as hardy to render
themselves Masters of them, as prudent to conserve them. We have in the City
fifteen hundred inhabitants, which are armed for us; and even now that I am
speaking to you, there are in the Suburbs two thousand of my Subjects, and as
many of the Duke of Placentia's, which are come to succor us.

Let us go then, my companions, and call the people again to liberty; let us
return to the sweetness of our ancient Government; let us exterminate the
Nobles and Jannetin's Tyranny; and in one only night, more shining then the
fairest days of our lives have been, let us re-establish the glory of the
popular families in their first splendour; let us for ever deface out of the
memories of men our past faint-heartedness. But if any of you (as I cannot
believe) be so audacious and so cowardly both together, as to oppose a design
so glorious for us, and advantageous for our Country, let him behold round
about him this dreadful company of Arms and Soldiers, and let him imagine that
he sees at the very same instant the points of all our swords leveled at his
heart. Yea, my Companions, I do protest it openly, we must of necessity either
fight or dye. And that blood which shall be ingratefully denied to the succor
of our Country, so near to ruin, shall be shed, in this very place, to wash
away the stain of such perfidiousness. Yea, I say it once again, the first
sacrifice, which shall be consecrated for the public safety, shall even here
have his throat cut with my hand, if any one undertakes to oppose my will.

These dreadful menaces amazed those to whom they were addressed; they beheld one
another, and then that great number of Soldiers which environed them; and after
they had been a while without speaking, they cried all with one voice, two
excepted, that they would follow the Count even to the death; that they would
be the companions of his triumph, or of his fall; and in conclusion, that they
would never abandon him, but would obey him in all things. The Count embraced
them then with a great deal of joy, and testimony of satisfaction; and being
turned toward those two, which as yet had said nothing, they besought him to
have pity of their weakness, with words wherein fear appeared so visible, as
the Count could not forbear smiling. They represented unto him, that the
request which they made him, was advantageous to him, as well as to them;
because being so incapable of fighting, they should hurt him more then they
could help him; that their fear might beget the same in others, and their
flight give an ill example to his Soldiers: Briefly, they gave him so many
marks of their affright and terror, as changing his determination, he only
contented himself with reproaching them for their cowardice in a bitter jear,
and for the security of his enterprise he caused them to be shut up in a
chamber, where he left them under a Guard, which should keep them from coming
forth. After this he commanded meat to be brought in, but in such a fashion, as
this meal might be rather named a collation, then a supper; fearing lest they
should be too much taken up with good cheer. Whilst then that some did eat
standing, and others were arming themselves with the Arms which the Count had
caused to be presented unto them, he went to Leonora's chamber, who was talking
with Sophronia her sister about the unquietness she was in to see so many
Soldiers in her Palace. As soon as he was entered, he approached to her, and
taking her by the hand, he told her in few words the design he had; desiring
her to pardon him for not having spoken to her of it till then.

The great heart of Leonora found not it self firm enough to remain constant in
this occasion; and considering the extreme peril whereinto the Count was going
to expose himself, affection and fear troubled her in such sort, as falling at
the Counts feet, and her face all bedewed with tears, My Lord, said she unto
him, embracing his knees, to what danger are you going to expose your self? I
conjure you by the thing that is dearest to you in the world, by the love which
I bear to you, by that which you b^ar to me, by the tears which I shed, and by
your own glory, to preserve my life in preserving yours. The interest of our
Country is dear to me, but yours is yet far more to me. I had rather have
Jannetin reign insolently, then to see you perish for the saving of others. And
I shall resolve with joy to wear chains, rather then to see my self exposed to
the hazard of wearing mourning for your death. But what say I, senseless as I
am? could I preserve my life, if you were no longer living? No, no, my destiny
is tied to yours; and what my despair could not do in this occasion, my grief
alone would execute. Let Jannetin then, my dear husband, usurp the Empire; let
our Country be ruined; let all our Citizens be made Slaves; provided that you
live it imports me not. For in the end Jannetin may indeed raise himself up
into the Throne, but he can never surmount you in greatness of courage and
virtue. You have told me an hundred times, that I made up all your felicity,
what do you seek for then, O my dear husband! Is it just, that you should be so
far sensible of the complaints of a people, that may be ungrateful, as to lose
your life for their liberty? And that my tears should move you so little, as
that you will not preserve me, in preserving your self? What will you have me
do in this fatal adventure? Will you have me, letting you go, attend here the
news of your death? Ah! I can never endure this thought, no more then your
design. For, my Lord, what can this design be, which I see you undertake,
without communicating it to your dearest friends? To whom of all those, which
are in this Palace, may I entrust your life? Are you your self assured, that
they will not abandon you? If I saw the generous Justiniano, the French
Marquess, and so many other illustrious friends, which you have, about you, I
could say that they would vanquish, or dye together with you. But in the estate
wherein I see you, it may be that those, whom you believe to be most faithful
unto you, have betrayed you, and have undertaken to destroy you. Ah! my Lord,
give an end to my fears and tears, in changing so deadly a resolution. But if
nevertheless you are determined, as methinks I observe by your looks, not to
let your sel^ be vanquished with my tears, suffer me at leastwise to accompany
you; that I may, in this abandonmen: of all your friends, serve you for a
buckler, to bear off all the blows which shall be made at you; that I may at
least expire before your eyes, or you dye in my arms. In fine, my Lord, permit
me to enter into your Charet of Triumph, or into your Tomb with you.

The Count, feeling himself very much moved with Leonora's tears, and fearing
to be surmounted by them, interrupted her with embraces; do not make so ill a
presage of my enterprise, said he unto her, and carry that great heart, which I
have always admired in you, to higher and more happy thoughts. I am going to a
place, whither Justice and Fortune call me; and if I have concealed this design
from my friends, it is because I knew they loved my life too well to counsel me
unto it. And then again I shall be glad, if Heaven will permit me to prevail
over my Enemies, that I have given them a content which has cost them nothing;
and if I fall in so brave an enterprise, they shall at leastwise remain to
comfort you. In fine, my dear Leonora, prepare your mind for all events that
may arrive, either happy, or unhappy; for the business is at such a pass, as I
can neither defer, or break it off: But this I can assure you, that you shall
not be long in uncertainty, and that in a few hours you shall hear of my death,
or victory; howsoever it be, remember, that, glory excepted, I never loved any
thing more then you. Farewell, my dear Leonora.

At this word his ambitious Mother came and interrupted him; who knowing that
the Count was touched with his Wives tears, and fearing he should be overcome
by them, Go, go, said she unto him, and call to mind, that if Coriolanus had
never been wrought upon by the tears of a woman, he had gotten himself the
Empire, and preserved his life. Fear not, my son, that I will be Volumnia in
this encounter, but contrarily I command you, as much as I can, to hasten the
execution of your enterprise, for all the time which you have lost here, would
already have served you for your approach to the Throne: Go then, my son,
perform an action proportionable to your courage, or find a death worthy of
your birth.

The Count, having heard his Mother speak in this sort, and having told her
that he would obey her, turned himself once again to Leonora, whom grief
suffocated, and beholding her with a troubled countenance, Farewell, said he
unto her, either you shall never see me more, or you shall see your self in
Genoua above all others of your sex. At these last words he left her, without
harkening to the generous Pansa, or the sage Sophronia; For as for Leonora, she
was so stricken with the Count's speech and departure, as she fell into a swoon.

In the mean time Baptista Verrin was come back from the City, to assure the
Count that there was no obstacle which could hinder his design; that his Gally
was in a posture of fighting, full of a great number of Soldiers, thoroughly
resolved to do then duty, and ready to shut up ^he mouth of the Port, by that
means besieging all those of Doria. The Count seeing all things in such order
as he could have wished, went to his friends again, and having made all them to
take up Arms which were to follow him, he issued out of his Palace three hours
after midnight. And to march in order, he made as it were a Vant-guard of an
hundred and fifty of the resolutest Soldiers he had, whom he advanced forty
paces before; himself he put in the head of all those young Gentlemen, which he
had brought along with him; and after marched in rank, and as it were in a
battalion, all the rest of his men. When he was arrived at the Suburbs, he
commanded some Soldiers to go under the conduct of a natural Brother of his,
named Cornelio, and seize upon the Bow gate, which was presently executed;
Cornelio finding no other resistance then of a few Soldiers, who being
surprised, scarce fought at all. This prosperous success redoubling the Count's
courage, he sent Giralomo and Ottobuono his Brothers, with Vincentio Calcagna,
who notwithstanding his natural timidity had not left following him, to render
themselves Masters of Saint Thomas Gate. He descended afterward through S.
Andrews street to S. Donat, and passing by the place of the Salvages with his
companions, he arrived at the point of Catana. Baptista Verrin went aboard the
Gally, and Thomaso Assereto did what he could to seize upon the gate of
Dars^ne; at first, in regard he was one of Jannetin's Officers, and had the
word, the Guards suffered him to enter; but perceiving so great a number of
armed m^n, wherewith he was followed, they rudely repulsed him: Nevertheless
seeing it was necessary, that some one should enter to open the gate unto the
Count, it was resolved that Scipio, one of his subjects, and a Captain of great
courage, should cast himself with some Soldiers into little Boats, kept there
of purpose, in case of necessity, and by that means enter by the Sea into the
Port, where the Galleys lay, and so facilitate the entrance of the rest of the
Conspirators thereinto. This design was as happily executed, as it was well
thought of; for albeit they found some resistance there, yet in regard the
Conspirators were more in number, and incomparably more valorous, it was easy
for them to prevail.

In the mean time the Count was come by Land to that Gate, where with much
impatience he attended the signal that was to be given him, which stayed longer
then it ought, by reason the Gally with her motion and agitation had struck her
self a ground, and it was above half an hour before they could set her afloat
again. All these things, which could not be done without noise, began to raise
a great deal; but at length the signal having been given, the Count, devancing
all his companions, leapt with exceeding courage into Doria's Galleys. This
unexp^cted violence, and the noise of Arms and Soldiers, having awaked all the
Mariners and Slaves, a dreadful and confused din of chains and voices was
suddenly heard. All the Sailors cried to Arms, all the Gally-Slaves resounded
the name of Liberty, and labored as much as they could to break off their
Irons: But the Count, who knew not what to do with the Galleys if he had not
men, considering what a prejudice the flight of the Slaves would bring unto
him, he cast himself ashore again, and went with all speed to the Admiral,
which with the sudden and unruly motion of them wherewith she was filled,
floated leasurely, and seemed as though she would eloign her self from the Land.

Whilst things past thus in the Port, Giralomo and Ottobuono failed not in
that which had been commanded them; for as soon as they heard the Cannon
discharged, which was the signal that was given to them, they went courageously
with threescore Soldiers to seize on S. Thomas gate, not only to render
themselves Masters of it, but to pass along unto Doria's Palace, which was hard
by, for to kill Andrea and Jannetin. This enterprise was not so facile unto the
Conspirators, as the former; the Soldiers that guarded this gate defended
themselves well enough; and Sebastiano Lercato with his Brother, whereof the one
was the Captain, and the other the Ensign, coming in, made all the resistance
that valiant men could do: But in the end, some of their Soldiers being
corrupted, and the assailants fighting like men that would vanquish or dye,
they were constrained to give place to the stronger, and the gate remained in
the power of the Conspirators, the Captain being made a prisoner, and the
Ensign slain there.

In the mean time the cries, clamors, and noise of Arms, which increased in the
Port, where the Galleys were, arrived even at Doria's Palace, which as you know
is not far d^stant from it, and where Andrea lay sick. Jannetin's wife first
hearing it, awaked her Husband, fearing some rising of the Gally-Slaves;
Jannetin rose instantly up, and having harkened a while, he made himself ready
in haste, believing nevertheless that he should find nothing else, but some
dispute about pay, or some other occasion, that had fall^n out amongst the
people of his Galleys. Andrea, more foreseeing then he, and fearing some
unlooked for accident, would not have had him gone forth, but well accompanied;
His Wife cast her self at his feet to keep him from it: but he, carried on by
his destiny, contemned the counsel of the one, and the prayers of the other,
and went out alone with one Groom of his Chamber, and a Page, that carried a
Torch before him, without any other Arms, then his single sword. When he
arrived at Saint Thomas gate, which he thought was guarded still by his own
followers, according to his insolent humor, whereunto the choler he was in
that time being joined, he fiercely commanded them to open unto him. Jannetin's
voice being straightway known of the Conspirators, they opened the gate, and
suffered him to enter without resistance; but scarcely was he entered, when as a
shower of Musket shot fell on him, and laid hm instantly dead on the ground.
This adventure made Giralomo and Ottobuono change the order which the Count had
given them, for going directly to Doria's Palace. For seeing Jannetin dead, who
was the only man of the Count's Enemies, that could satisfy with his person;
and believing that the Count had rendered himself Master of the Galleys, they
did not think that Andrea, fourscore years of age, and sick of the gout, could
bring any great obstacle to their design. Moreover they feared, that if they
should go to Doria's Palace, the riches of the booty would withdraw the most
part of the Soldiers from the action, and make them quit their Arms, to lade
themselves with the plunder of such rich movables, as it was full of.

In the mean time, the noise and disorder still increasing, Andrea was much
troubled for Jannetin, not being able to imagine what should be the cause of so
much stir. But at length having sent one of his servants, certainly to know the
occasion of this Tumult, he brought him word, that the Count of Lavagna had
made himself Master of Genoua; that the Republique was in extreme peril; that
his Galleys were full of his Enemies; that the people resounded all about the
word of Liberty, and the name of Giovanni Lodovico; that furious men ran up and
down with Arms in their hands; that there was nothing seen but blood and
slaughter; and that every where was talking of outrages against the Nobles, and
menaces against his life. So dreadful a relation persuading Andrea that the
matter was past remedy, he resolved to attend the violence of his Enemies in
his Palace, and to yield to them whom he could not resist. But his wife, and
his servants, with their tears, entreaties and reasons, made him at last
resolve to let himself be carried down into his Palace-yard, where they set him
on an horse with much ado; in this estate they conducted him to Mazona, which
is a Castle belonging to a Kinsman of mine, and from thence to another place,
where they understood the death of Jannetin, with which he was sensibly touched.

In the mean time the Conspirators still advanced their design; and whereas
this noise and Tumult had awaked every one, all the Count's particular friends
having heard the people cry, Long live the Count of Lavagna, went forth with
Arms in their hands to see what the matter was, and to join themselves with
him; and amongst the rest Doria, the French Marquis, and I, who by chance lay
together that night, going also forth to seek the Count, met some thirty paces
from my lodging, Giralomo with all his Troop, who sought for him as well as we.
All the people, that took his part, required to see their Deliverer; but though
there was crying every where, Long live the Count of Lavagna, and that every
one enquired after him, yet no body answered thereunto. This silence made us
fear some disastrous success, yet did it not make them give over the design of
pursuing a victory, which seemed so certain. Giralomo left a sufficient Guard
at the gates, and sent Ottobuono to take a care of the Galleys, in case his
Brother was not there. The French Marquis followed him, and I stayed with
Giralomo, who being accompanied only with two hundred Soldiers, went, as he
had resolved, through all the streets of Genoua, to cause the people, both with
his speeches, and the hope of Liberty, to rise. And though the Count appeared
not, yet each one declared himself for him, with earnestly demanding where he
was. The City in the mean space was in a general confusion and consternation;
every one ran up and down in the streets, without knowing whither they went;
every one asked of one another what was the cause of this dreadful disorder,
without knowing what to answer; the women out of their windows, in the midst of
the cries and lamentations which they made, called for their husbands, their
brothers, and their children. The Nobles, in so great a disorder, would
willingly for the public interest have resorted to the Palace, that they
might have advised together what to do, but their particular interest kept them
from it, and the doubt they were in, lest their houses should be plundered in
their absence, retained them still there.

Caesar's Ambassador, surprised with this unexpected accident, was upon the
point of going out of Genoua, for fear lest the person of the Prince, to whom
he belonged, should be outraged in his; but at length after he had gotten
company about him, he resolved to see the matter decided, and according to
occasions to take such a course as should be most advantageous for his Master.
To that effect he went to the Palace, where he found Cardinal Doria and some
others, who consulted with the Senate, whereof Nicola Franco was the Chief,
there being no Duke at that time. They resolved that Bonifacio Lomellin, one of
the Pallaxucins, and Antonio Calvo, with the Ensign of the Guard and fifty
Soldiers, should go and defend S. Thomas Gate; but having on the way encountered
with the Troop where we were, they were constrained to retire into one of their
friends houses, but not without leaving some of their men prisoners. Part of
them went in great haste by another street to the same gate to learn some news
of Andrea; but finding it well guarded, and Lomellin having at the very first
been made a prisoner, they fled away with great precipitation, whereat ours
were so joyful, as this prisoner escaped from them.

In the mean time it was not known where the Count was; they that were with
Giralomo thought he was at the Port; they of the Port on the other side
believed that he had left them to repair unto his brothers; Ottobuono not
finding him there, thought that he was gone to visit the Gates, or it may be to
Doria's Palace; they of the Gates were persuaded that he was in the City; in
fine, every one thought any thing save the truth. But amongst all the rest,
Baptista Verrin, as having the greatest share in the enterprise, was most
earnest in asking after him. He saw the business so well carried, and the
Victory so certain, as he was mad for that he could not see the Count; the
Gates of the City were theirs; they were Masters of the Port; the people
favored them; the Nobles seemed to make no opposition; the Senate had no Duke;
Andrea was fled, and had left the field to his Enemies; and Jannetin was dead;
in fine, there wanted nothing but that the Count should show himself to the
people for receiving the Oath of Allegiance from them. But all Verrin's care
was in vain, so that hearing no news of him, and seeing the enterprise ruined
if he did not appear, he retired in despair unto the Gally, to the end that if
the Count came, he might secure him the Port still, which was a matter of
extreme importance; and if the enterprise were ruined by his absence, that he
might have the means to fly to Marseilles: This resolution was the cause of
very much mischief to Giralomo; because the Conspirators, neither seeing the
Count, who was their Head, nor Baptista Verrin, who had been always the
principal Agent in the Conspiracy, did not so much rely on the conduct of
Giralomo, who being very young, and of an haughty humor, carried things with
more impetuosity then discretion: They followed him for all that out of the
hope that the Count would appear ere it were long; but it was not with that
confidence, which makes one abandon his life without unquietness, and obey
without repugnancy an Head whom one esteems, and of whose prudence and valor
one is assured, so that one reserves no more care then to fight and obey: but
contrarily the most part began to murmur, yea and some thought already of
seeking some occasion to withdraw, or at leastwise to go and enquire out the
Count. On the other side, the Senate, not knowing what resolution to take, and
believing that affairs were altogether remediless, desired Cardinal Doria, and
some others, to go and find out the Count of Lavagna, which at first he
accepted of, but some having counseled him not to expose his dignity to the
insolences of a people in fury, he refused it; and the Senate deputed for the
same effect six Gentlemen of quality, with order to know of the Count what he
desired. But at the same time, when as the Deputies went out of the Palace to
seek for the Count, we understood, Madam, the most deplorable adventure that
ever arrived: For since our ill fortune must be told you, we learned that the
Count, being returned to Land (as I have already declared to you) from aboard
Doria's Galleys, to go to the Admiral, which he meant to secure himself of, in
passing over a plank, which lay with one end on the Land, and with the other on
a little ladder that is near to the Poop, the Gally stirring somewhat made the
plank lose its hold, so that it fell, and in falling tumbled the Count into the
water, who being armed at all pieces could not dis-engage himself from that
peril; and even those arms, which he had taken to preserve his life, were the
cause of his death; for had it not been for them, he f^ll so near the shore, as
it was impossible he should have been drowned: the tumult and the darkness
contributed also very much to his loss, which was not seen by any of his
followers, and that was the reason it was published no sooner. We had no
certain knowledge of it but by the French Marquess, who being gone, as I have
told you, with Ottobuoni, and asking of every one where the Count was, two
Mariners of the Admiral, who had seen him fall, and heard his voice which they
knew very well, as having served him before-times, assured him that he was
dead; which having understood with extreme grief, he thought it fit to come
unto us, and acquaint Giralomo with it; for as for Ottobuono he had lost him in
the press. He came presently away then, to acquaint us with this doleful news,
but having encountered, as he told us, with a great number of armed men, which
issued out of your Palace, whereof the Gate was broken up, he stayed to learn
what the matter might be; and thinking that he knew the voice of Emilia, whom
they were carrying forcibly away, he pursued them fighting even to the Port.

Isabella hereupon remembered her carrying away, and interrupting Alphonso,
Behold, said she to Emilia, that which we could not comprehend, and the true
cause of that dreadful disorder, whereof I thought that I had been the
occasion. And then she recounted, how she had been forcibly carried away, and
after she had testified her gratitude to the French Marquess for the succor he
would have given her, and craved pardon of the company for her interrupting
Alphonso's relation, he continued his discourse in this sort.

The French Marquess having been a good while pursuing those which carried you
away, it was the cause that we knew not the deplorable death of the Count, till
there wanted nothing but his presence, to make an end of obtaining the Victory:
And judge, Madam, whether there can be any doubt of this verity, since the Count
being dead almost at the beginning of the execution, it may be said that his
name alone vanquished all his Enemies: And certainly if he had lived, the
business had had a quite contrary event. For my part I profess unto you, that I
shall never be comforted for this death. Had the enterprise succeeded ill; had
any of the Conspirators betrayed him; had the people abandoned him; had the
Nobles resisted him; had Jannetin vanquished him; I should say that these are
ordinary things, that these are accidents, whereof there are are examples
found: But to see a man of two and twenty years of age, the goodliest, the
handsomest, the most courageous, the most dextrous, the fullest of spirit, and
the most generous that ever was seen, to see him, I say, after he had contrived
a great design; after he had so admirably conducted it; after he had deceived
Andrea Doria; abused the whole Republique; was come not only to the execution,
but also had executed the business; Jannetin being dead, and Andrea himself
fled away; after all these things, I say, to imagine, that this excellent man
should fall from off a plank, and be drowned not above three or four steps from
the Land in five food of mud, is so unsupporable to me, Madam, as I cannot
endure the thought of it.

But to testify unto you, that the Count alone held the Victory in his hands,
I am but to to tell you the end of this enterprise. The French Marquess had no
sooner acquainted Giralomo with the death of his brother, but the Deputies from
the Senate appeared. At first, some would have set upon them, nevertheless this
tumult being appeased, one of the Deputies advanced, and demanded of Giralomo
where the Count was, to acquaint him with what he had in charge from the
Senate; Giralomo surprised with this demand, answered rudely and
inconsiderately, that he should seek for no other Count of Lavagna but himself,
for he was now the Count, and that to him only they were to render up the
Palace, which he ordained them to do, and that with speed. The Deputies
understanding by this imprudent answer that the Count was dead, returned back
to advertise the Senate of the change of things by the death of the Count. This
news put them in heart again, so that they instantly commanded twelve of the
chiefest of them, that were come to the Palace, to go and arm as many of the
people as they could, and joining them with the ordinary guard, to use their
uttermost endeavor to chase the Conspirators out of the City, or utterly to
defeat them: But there was no need of fighting to put them to flight, for they
were vanquished in the death of the Count; which being published over all, put
one and the same resolution into the minds of all those who had taken up arms
for him. And whereas the day began to break, they desired it should not be
said, that they had been in arms against their Citizens; wherefore they began
to retire one after another to their homes: They which had taken arms in the
Counts Palace left them in the streets, for fear lest if their houses should
come to be searched, they might have been convicted of being of the number of
the Rebels; and they which contrarily had taken them in their own homes,
carried them thither again, for fear left leaving them in the streets they
might be accused for making use of them in this occasion. We past not one
corner of a street, but it cost us above thirty Soldiers; some s^ly slunk away;
others ran away as hard as they could drive; and in conclusion, they which
guarded the Gates abandoned them: Things went in that manner, as when Giralomo
came to S. Lawrence's Church, which was fast by the Palace, he was almost alone.

In the mean time the generous Pansa having been sent for by the Senate, who
perfectly knew the virtue of this excellent man, he so wrought with them, that
he got them to change the order they had given for fighting with Giralomo, into
that of propounding unto him his departure out of Genoua, his retiring unto
Montobio which belonged to him, and pardoning in consideration of him all the
Conspirators, provided they continued still in the City. Pansa was chosen to
make this proposition, which was accepted, and executed instantly. So that the
break of day arriving, one would have said, that the blood which was seen spilt
on the ground; the bodies of those that had been slain; the houses that had
been broken up; and so many other disorders, whereof the marks were evident;
had been the work of an invisible hand. No Enemy appeared, all the Tradesm^n
were in their shops, every man was in his house, and Genoua was never in a
greater tranquillity, at leastwise as we were told afterward: For as for us,
as soon as we understood of the Counts death, we went directly to his Palace to
save his dear Leonora: Doria's interest in Sophronia made him go thither with
incredible speed; and though he was Jannetin's kinsman, yet having never
affected him, and been hardly used by Andrea, his love met with no very mighty
obstacle to overcome. The French Marquess was carried thither by his own
generosity, and I by the desire I had to serve the Count in the person of
Leonora. At such time as we left Giralomo, he had still some Soldiers about
him, so that believing him to be in safety enough we went to the Counts Palace,
fearing some violence would be offered to her; there we met with Horatio, come
thither as well as we, and at the same instant, with a Gentleman from
Ottobuono, who after he knew of his brothers death, had gotten with Baptista
Verrin, Raphaello Sacco, and Vincentio Calcagna, into the Counts Gally for to
fly away; but being moved with compassion for Leonora, he sent this Gentleman
to will her that she would get her self to be safely conducted to the Port,
where she might save her self with him. We being then thus all encountered here
together, Sophronia, who had heard of our repair thither, left Leonora on her
bed, and came out unto us; for she rightly imagined, that it may be we had some
dismal news to tell, which was not fit for her to know. She presently discerned
by our looks the misfortune that was arrived unto as; but it being no time to
lament, we arrested our tears and her sighs, and declaring unto her the estate
of things, we represented unto her, that we were not to suffer the Count to be
outraged in the person of Leonora; that her loss was undoubted if she stayed
longer in this Palace; that the people peradventure would come and set it on
fire; or it may be the Senate would cause it to be razed to the ground; and
that in fine it was requisite by flight to avoid outrages worse then death;
that Julio Cibo her eldest brother hated them all; that it would be glorious
for her to make away with a brother of her husbands; and in conclusion, that it
was for her to persuade Leonora to the taking of this resolution; that for us,
we protested unto her, that we would follow her fortune; and that the Counts
mother, albeit the cause of his loss, was notwithstanding to be set in a place
of safety, for the glory of her son; for fear lest some extraordinary violence
should be used against her.

Sophronia having mused a while said, She was confident that Leonora, if once
she came to know the death of the Count, would never think of preserving her
life; that the only fear of it had already put her into such a violent despair,
as it would be impossible to make her resolve for that which they desired of
her, when she should be assured of it. Doria, having heard this objection,
said, that Leonora was to be beguiled, and only told, that the Counts
enterprise having succeeded ill, he was retired into his Gally, whither he
willed her to r^pair, having to that purpose sent us for her; and for fear she
should come to know the truth of the matter, his mother also was to be beguiled
in the same manner.

This advice being well approved of, we entered into Leonora's chamber, who no
sooner saw us, but she rose up, and with a dismayed countenance and tears in
her eyes, she demanded of us, whether the Count were dead? we answered her as
we had before resolved; and declaring the business unto her with as many
circumstances as we could, to render it the more probable, we so wrought with
her, that she believed us, and constantly resolved for her flight. We found not
the same facility in the Counts mother; What, said she unto us, does he, who
promised me to vanquish or to dye, prepare himself to fly? Ah! base and
inconsiderate, cried she, I will go to find thee out, not to fly away with
thee, but to oblige thee once more to fight, and if I cannot do that, I shall
at leastwise have the satisfaction of reproaching thee for thy want of courage.
This said, she marched foremost, and I advanced to lead her; Sophronia took a
little casket wherein her sisters jewels were, and unto her Doria lent his
hand; the French Marquess conducted Leonora; as for Horatio, he followed alone,
being very much grieved to abandon Hipolita: But Fortune, who was willing to
favor him, so ordered it, that being arrived just before Doria's house, we
heard people coming in wonderful haste, which without doubt were some of them
that fled; finding our selves then in so commodious a place for to let them
pass by, we entered into Doria's house; and whereas Hipolita was exceedingly
troubled both for her brother and her Lover, she no sooner heard their two
voices, mingled with some women's, but she came down to us, and understanding
our design, What, said she to her brother, will you abandon me? I do not
abandon you, sister, answered he, but Love and Fortune do snatch me from you.
Hipolita's mother was de^d not long b fore, so that having nothing to retain
her at Genoua, and not knowing withal what should become of her, she made use
of all these reasons to persuade her brother he would permit her not to abandon
him, or to speak more truly, not to quit Horatio. What, said she unto him, will
you have me stay here, that Andrea may revenge himself on me, for the injury
which he believes he has received from you? And having lost my mother, and
seeing my self forsaken of my brother, shall I abide here without support and
comfort? I do not desire you to leave Sophronia, but that you will permit me to
follow her. Hipolita spoke this with so much grief, that every one was touched
with it. And when as Horatio prayed Sophronia, that she would oblige Doria to
consent thereunto, Doria embraced his sister with a great deal of affection,
and told her, that he was ravished with her generosity.

Hipolita having obtained her desire, and we no longer hearing any passing by,
we proceeded on in our way toward the Port, where we arrived without any
obstacle. Ottobuono's Gentleman conducted us to the Count's Gally, where we
were received, and Leonora put into the Captains Cabin, being told that the
Count would come thither to her. The Mother, when she was there, asked of every
one, where the Count was? I approached to her, and told her that she should
know ere it were long. In the mean time we were no sooner got aboard, but we
propounded the sending to Giralomo, that he might come to save himself with us.
Verrin without harkening thereunto, commanded them to steer for Marseilles,
whereupon all the Slaves betaking them to their Oars, the Gally made from the
Port, which was left free and open to the Turks, who had abandoned their own
Vessel, and taken one of Doria's Galli^s, named the Temperance. They went away
in this sort, and could never be overtaken by two Galleys, which were sent
after them the next day. The most part of the Gally-Slaves having knocked off
their Irons, stole all the Arms, and all that they could lay hold of; and
getting away, they alone enjoyed the liberty, which the Count would have
acquired for himself.

This while, Madam, we remained in the Gally of this illustrious unfortunate
man, but with so much grief, as never voyage had so sad a beginning. Baptista
Verrin was mad to see his enterprise broken; Vincentio Calcagna upbraided him
with being the cause of all this mischief; Raphaello Sacco rep^nted him for
having counseled so unlucky a design; and Ottobu^no, without testifying his
thoughts, continued in a silence, that would not permit us to know what they
were. As for the rest of us, although we had all of us misfortunes, which
diversely regarded us, yet the death of the Count prevailed over all our other
sufferings, and his loss in this occasion made up all our sorrow. In the mean
season, Leonora, not seeing him, and perceiving the Gally make from the Port,
pressed Sophronia that she might see him, and hearing her sister make her no
precise answer, she of her self knew the misfortune that was happened unto him:
And when as we entered into her chamber all at one time, and that she saw him
not amongst us, she cried out, and said, There is no longer doubt but that the
Count it dead. The Count dead! said the Mother with a great deal of
precipitation. Yes, Madam, continued Vincentio Calcagna, who was extremely
touched with this loss, and dead by your commandment: you enjoined him to
vanquish or to dye, and he has done both, Madam; for he is dead after the
death of his Enemy. We were very sorry that this man had delivered the matter
so bluntly before the unfortunate Leonora, who unable to support so many
sorrows at once, swooned in the Arms of Sophronia.

As for the Count's Mother, she entered into a rage that cannot be represented
unto you; the apprehensions of a Mother having reassumed their place in her
soul, she said all that grief, anger, repentance, fury, and despair could make
one say. Oh! cried she, it is I that have laid the Count in his grave! I am
thinking of my safety, and making from a place, where it may be I should be
punished for the crime I have committed! Ah, no, no, I must be carried back to
Land; I must go and be torn in pieces by an enraged people: I must acquaint
them that I am the only cause of the Conspiracy, and so losing my life by
their fury, receive the punishment which I deserve.

But whilst this ambitious woman repented her of her violence, and punished
her self for her own fault, the unhappy Leonora came out of her swoon; she had
no sooner opened her eyes, but turning her self to her sister, she demanded of
her where the Count's body was, and prayed her that at leastwise they would
let her see it. We thought then, to the end her grief might not be renewed
another time, that it was b^st to tell her the truth of the matter, and
acquaint her, that being drowned, his body was not in our power. This last
circumstance of the Count's misfortune, redoubled Leonora's affliction. Could I
not at least, said she with a languishing voice, have had the consolation to be
enclosed with him in the same Tomb? scarcely had she ended those words, but
suddenly passing from one extremity to another, she rose up with violence, and
entreated us that we would leave her on the shore, there to spend her life in
seeking for the body of her dear Husband. And when as we resisted her
entreaties, she termed us ungrateful, cruel, and insensible; nay she would have
rid her self out of our hands, to have gone and cast her self into the Sea, but
at length the excess of her grief, and her weakness, made her tumble down again
into Sophronia's arms, almost without any sense; and after that, as long as we
were upon the Sea, we never heard her speak but once only, which was the next
day at night, when as there arose so furious a tempest, as we verily believed
we should have suffered shipw^ach. Leonora, having observed by the cries of the
Mariners that we were in danger, seemed to receive some consolation from it;
then looking on Sophronia and Hipolita, whom the fear of death, which they
believed to be so near, possessed with strange unquietness; Do not afflict your
selves, said she unto them, I am too unhappy to suffer shipwreck, and death
will be sure not to succor me.

But not to weary you with so doleful a relation, I shall tell you in few
words, that the tempest redoubled in such sort, that it drove us to Albengua,
where Leonida having a house, was gone thither a good while before. We had no
sooner cast anchor, but having been advertised of the mishap of her dear
friends, she came to visit them, and would so far take part with them in their
afflictions, that when we had furnished our selves with another Vessel at
Albengua, and were putting forth again to Sea, she would not abandon them. But
I forget that it is not yet time to speak of our departure from Albengua; you
shall understand then that at such time as we arrived there, Leonora suffered
her self to be carried whither soever one would, and without so much as
demanding where we were, so exceedingly was her Soul possessed with sorrow. As
for the Counts mother, the distemper whereinto she had put her self with her
crying, lamentations, and repentance, brought her to so violent a fever, as
refusing all kind of remedies she dyed a little after. And to make an end of
telling you the whole sequel of the Counts Conspiracy, you are to understand
that which we learned at Albengua, where we tarryed a good while, which is,
that after we parted from Genoua, and that Giralomo was retired to Montobio,
the Count's body was found; and dead as he was, remained still a terror to his
Enemies. Andrea would not suffer him to be exposed to the view of the people,
for fear lest so deplorable an object should cause some sedition, and the love
which was born to him should renew the pass^d disorders.

In the mean time Ottobuono took our Gally, and left us at Albengua, that he
might with the more speed get to Marseilles; Baptista Verrin, and his two
friends, abandoned us also, and putting themselves into Montobio, the Senate,
having elected a Duke, retracted the abolition they had given to the
Conspirators. And for that effect, they confiscated all the Counts Estate,
declared his two Brothers Rebels to the Republ^que, and then sent Pansa to
persuade Giralomo to render up Montobio, where he had fortified himself. But
Giralomo, who by nature was boisterous, answered him as if he had a mind to
augment the suspicion which they had of him, that he held that place in the
name of a Prince, more mighty then the Senate, meaning in this occasion the
King of France, unto whom the illustrious family of the Counts of Lavagna, have
always been much affected. This answer exasperated things in such sort, as
shortly after Montobio was besieged by Augustino Spinola, on whom this
employment was conferred, and so hardly laid unto, that Baptista Verrin
counseled Giralomo to render at discretion, which he instantly did. But within
a while Baptista Verrin had cause to repent him of his bad counsel; for Andrea
Doria, seeing the Senate inclined to clemency, came thither in person, and
spoke with so much vehemence, as he caused them to change their minds, and
carried matters to their uttermost violence, by making them to be put to death
against the public sense.

Behold, Madam, what the deplorable fortune of the Count has been; as for the
rest of us, after we had taken another Vessel at Albengua, and being put again
to Sea would have directed our course for Marseilles, our navigation was not
more prosperous this second time then formerly it had been; for we were not far
from the Port, when as the tempest began again with such fury, as during six
days and six nights we were continually in expectation of being cast away. At
l^ngth a calm having succeeded the storm, we came to discover Land; but we were
mightily surprised, when as our Pilot assured us, that that which we saw was
the City of Marocco. Our Vessel was so bruised, as we resolved to land there;
and this design being executed, the King of Marocco received us with a great
deal of courtesy. Now for that which arrived unto us there, and for that which
brought us to Constantinople, I think it will be requisite to refer the
relation thereof to another time: And whereas the beautiful Hipolita and
Sophronia have a greater share in it then I, you shall, if you please, learn
the sequel of our fortune from their mouths.

It is without doubt very deplorable, said Isabella, and I can assure you, that
I have not felt that motion in my heart, which they say is so ordinary with
every one, and causes us in some sort to be comforted for our miseries, when we
see others unfortunate as well as our selves; but contrarily I find my sorrow
augmented thereby. That proceeds from your generosity, said Sophronia unto her,
but do not lament the Count so much, as not to reserve some sighs for my
sister, whom we have lost as well as he, with the grief she took for his death.
The Princess hereupon redoubled her complaints, which had not finished so soon,
if a Capigibassi had not come and told her, that it was time to return to the
old Serraglio, because the gates thereof were always used to be shut somewhat
early. Isabella rose up blushing, and without any resistance, parted somewhat
unwillingly from her dear friends, promising to come and see them again the
next day: Howbeit she would needs conduct these three fair persons to their
lodging first, for they would at no hand lie asunder in several chambers. And
after that she had rendered them this civility whether they would or no; and
after that Doria, Horatio, and Alphonso had waited upon her and Emilia to her
Charet, she returned to the old Serraglio with the same magnificence, as she
came from thence.

IBRAHIM: OR, THE ILLUSTRIOUS BASSA. The Fourth Part.
The First Book.
ISabella was no sooner awake the next day, but the Slave, which Roxellana had
suborned, came and told her from the Grand Signior, that at length his care had
not been in vain; that after a very exact search, the Slave, whose liberty she
had desired, had been found out, and sent immediately to Ibrahim's Palace unto
his other friends; and that the Sultan entreated she would be pleased he might
come and visit her. Isabella not daring to refuse a favor unto a Prince, who
accorded her so many, answered, that the Sultan did her too much honor, and how
she was very glad that in coming to visit her he gave her the opportunity to
thank him for the new obligation wherein she stood engaged unto him. This Slave
then left the Pr^ncess, and went unto Soliman, to whom, according to the
directions she had for it, she amplified Isabella's civilities, and with that
which she delivered, persuaded him, that the Princess might be acquainted,
without any great offense, with the passion he was in for her. In this opinion
he went to the old Serraglio, with a determination to use some artifice to keep
her from going so often to visit her friends. In the mean time Isabella had
used such diligence in making her self ready, as she had leisure to go, before
Soliman repaired to her lodging, and entreat the Sultana Asteria, that she
would be with her when as the Grand Signior should come to see her, as he had
sent her word he would, imagining that her presence might stop him from saying
any thing to her that would offend her, if it were so that he had a mind
thereunto. Asteria, who loved Isabella, would by no means deny her, so that
when the Sultan arrived there, he found them both together; yet durst he not
testify how much he was displeased at it, but contrarily magnified Asteria's
good hap, in that she could always be with her; commended her for the care she
had taken to make her self agreeable to her; thanked Isabella for the affection
she showed her; and after a long compl^ment, which still gave her occasion to
increase her suspicions, he suffered her at length to render him thanks for the
French M^rquess his liberty, and to crave his permission for her to go and
rejoice her self with her dear friends.

Soliman blushed at this request, and after he had stood a pretty while silent,
he assured her that she might absolutely do whatsoever she pleased:
Nevertheless if she would permit him to speak freely in this occasion, he would
confess unto her, that he should be glad she would not go forth every day,
because the people might at length find something to say, upon seeing so
extraordinary a liberty of going in and out of the Serraglio; that the Sultana
Queen, who might do so when she would, seldom or never made use of that
liberty: Wherefore he prayed her to have some regard to the waywardness of the
people, who peradventure might fall into some sedition, wherein her friends
might be involved; that he did not desire she should not go thither any more,
but only that she should not go every particular day; howsoever he assured her
that she might do as she pleased, choosing rather to expose his Empire to all
things, then to expose himself to the hazard of her displeasure by constraining
her in any thing. Isabella answered as she ought to so obliging a discourse,
howbeit she requested the Sultan to permit her to visit them for two or three
days more together, because she had an extreme desire to understand all their
adventures, and after that she promised his Highness she would not see them so
often. The Sultan, who was willing to win the heart of Isabella, and to
vanquish her rather with courtesy then with violence, consented to her
request, and the more to comply with her also, he went away from her sooner
then he had determined, to give her the longer time for the visiting of her
friends; unto whom likewise, for a greater demonstration of his favor unto her,
he sent most magnificent presents, as soon as he was returned to his Serraglio.

In the mean time Isabella, after she had given thanks to the Sultana Asteria
for her assistance, and had entreated her to continue it to her, entered into a
Charet with Emilia, and went unto Ibrahim's Palace, where she found a great
deal of joy for the return of the French Marquess, who in his particular was
not a little glad to learn from his friends the happy encounter they had made
of Isabella, which had caused both their liberty and his. He no sooner knew
then that she was arrived, but he descended in all haste to go and receive her:
And whereas the change of places, misfortune, and slavery, had brought none to
his humor, he scarcely saw her appear before he advanced to kiss her robe; I do
not know, Madam, said he unto her, whether I ought rather to give you thanks
for breaking my chains here in Constantinople, or to complain of you for that
you are going to give me others in making me see Emilia again. Isabella not
able sufficiently to admire the tranquillity of the Marquess his mind; I should
not have believed, answered she him smiling, that ever I could have envied you,
but I acknowledge to you now, that I would willingly be almost of your humor,
for in fine, be it virtue or insensibility, you are ever happy. The Marq^ess
was going to answer her, but the arrival of Sophronia, Hipolita, and Leonida,
of Horatio, Doria, and Alphonso, kept him from it, whereof he was not sorry, to
the end he might make a complement in particular to Emilia, who without doubt
was somewhat joyful to see the Marquess; for although she had no great
affection for him, because she was not capable of it, yet did she infinitely
esteem of him, and bore a great deal of good will to his person.

After this fair Troop had used many civilities to one another, they entered all
into Ibrahim's chamber, where Isabella, to husband the time which she had to be
with a company, that was so agreeable to her, desired them to acquaint her with
the sequel of their misfortunes. The Marquess, beginning first to speak, said,
that for his part he had none but good fortunes to relate unto her since his
coming to Constantinople. Therefore, said the Princess, they shall be kept for
the last, as indeed it is fittest that I should understand things in order as
they fell out. Hipolita seeing it was but reason, entreated her brother Doria,
that he would take the pains to do it, upon condition nevertheless that he
should spare her in some parts of his relation, by omitting certain things,
which he called Caprichioes, and which she was persuaded was an effect of
sovereign reason. Doria accepted of this commission, but howsoever he told his
sister, that he would be a true Historian, and since she believed that Reason
always ruled her thoughts, she needed not to fear they should be known.
Isabella apprehending that this dispute would make Doria lose time, prayed him
not to harken to Hipol^ta, who questionless could not take it ill, that any
thing should be known which she had done. Doria, according to the Princesses
desire, without giving any further ear to his sister, began to speak thus, as
soon as ever this fair Troop was set.

The History of HIPOLITA, SOPHRONIA, and LEONIDA.
I Will not renew Sophronia's sorrow in particularizing unto you the loss of
Leonora, since it will suffice me to tell you, that her end had no other cause
but her affliction; and that her destiny was such, as dying on the main Sea, we
were constrained to give her the same Tomb, which the injustice of Fortune had
given her illustrious husband: But to get away speedily from so lamentable an
adventure, you shall understand, that we were no sooner arrived at Marocco, but
we lost all that the Tempest had left us, that is to say, the wrack of the
Vessel and out liberty. For whereas they knew us at the first sight to be
Christians, hardly had we cast anchor when as they made us Slaves. Indeed it is
true, that in the beginning our servitude was easy enough; for as our good
Fortune would have it, the Princess Mariama, sister to King Abdalla, who raigns
at Marocco, passed accidentally along by the Port when as we were making into
it; and this Princess seeing our ship without sails, without rudder, the tackle
torn, the sail-yards broken, and every part of it almost battered in pieces,
she caused the Charet, wherein she was, to stay, that she might see us land,
and know of what Nation we were: for the Tempest had left our Vessel no marks,
whereby it might be known. When as we came near the Port, whither the wind,
rather then the skill of the Pilot, conducted us, there was not one in the Ship
which got not up on the deck to behold this Land, where we hoped, if we did not
find a refuge, at leastwise we should escape casting away: So that the Princess
Mariama, having observed women amongst us, redoubled her curiosity and
compassion much the more. As soon as ever we touched Land, then she commanded
us to be brought unto her, that she her self might know who we were, and what
our fortune had been. This order having been observed, they led us before this
Princess; and verily this first encounter was an happy presage for us, and an
extreme consolation for the beautiful Sophronia, Leonida, and Hipolita; for
this Princess has so much majesty and sweetness, as she caused in us both a
great deal of respect, and a great deal of hope. And whereas she had noted by
our apparel that we were of Italy, and not understanding that Tongue, she would
not stand to send for an Interpreter, but thought that some of us peradventure
could speak Spanish, which she understood perfectly, and is common enough
throughout all the Kingdoms of Fez, Tunis, and Marocco, by reason of the
neighborhood of Spain with this part of Africa, and of the Wars and Commerce,
which in former times they have had one with another, especially before the
Kings of Granado, who were originally Moors, were subdued by Ferdinando and
Isabella. And truly she was not deceived in her conjecture, for there was not
any of us but spoke it well, or at leastwise could make our selves be
understood in it.

When as this Princess saw that her design had succeeded, she testified as much
joy for it as we did; and having demanded of us whither we were going, of
whence we were, and in what place we had been taken with the Tempest? we told
her all things as they had past, without acquainting her nevertheless with the
occasion that had caused us to part from Genoua, and without telling her our
names, and falling at her feet we besought her to protect us; for by the
respect which was rendered to her, and by her train, we believed she was Queen
of Marocco. This excellent Princess made us rise up with a great deal of
courtesy; and being touched with the charms of those whom we conducted, she
took an affection to us, and resolved to serve us as much as she could. But
whereas she was willing to observe in all things the respect which she owed to
the King her brother, she took up Sophronia, Leonida, and my sister, into the
Charet to her, and commanding us to follow her, she willed some of the Guard
that attended upon her, to lend us their horses. We went in this manner to
Abdalla's Palace, whom we found alone with his Favorite, called Ali-Ben Ducar,
a man of a great spirit, but cruel and ambitious. As soon as Mariama appeared,
and that the King saw he^ followed by so many unknown persons, and chiefly of
three fair women (if my sister can suffer me to put her in that number) he was
so surprised therewith, that advancing presen ly toward her, he said to her in
her language, (as Mariama recounted unto us afterward,) What adventure is
befallen you? from what War are you come? what Conquest have you made? and by
what good hap have you met with so fair a Troop? The Princess Mariama, who had
so much goodness, as that she would not be suspected of us, said unto him in
Spanish, (for he understood it as well as she,) that Fortune having put so many
afflicted persons into her hands, she came to crave permission of him, that she
might take care of them, protect them, and restore them to their liberty.

Aly, who understood this Tongue, and that all the time of Mariama's discourse
had eyed Hipolita, as well as Abdalla, with a great deal of attention, and it
may be already with a great deal of love, approached and said in Spanish, that
one must needs be very inhumane, which would not protect such beautiful
persons; but, continued he, speaking to Mariama in her natural Tongue, you may
not, Madam, deprive these three fair creatures, of the honor of being your
Slaves; Liberty cannot be so happy to them as this servitude, and you will be
cruel to them in using them otherwise. Aly has reason, replied the King in his
language, and to content you and them to, I permit you to take care of them,
and to protect them; and I do withal conjure you to retain them in your
service. You know that all the Christians are our Enemies, so that to set them
at liberty, when we have them in our hands, were to violate our Religion, and
to infringe our Laws, wherefore accept of these fair strangers for your Slaves:
But whereas their beauty deserves a gentler usage then others, give them no
other, said he smiling, but cords of silk to retain them. My Lord, answered
Mariama, the greatest of all good things is Liberty, and by consequence the
greatest of all evils is servitude; there are no chains that are not heavy, and
the less they be, the more do they straiten him that wears them; In fine, my
Lord, either they do load him, or they do wring him, and both the one and the
other is always grievous.

It was in this sort, Madam, that the Princess Mariama spoke to obtain our
liberty; and that which carried her yet more to oblige us, was, because Aly,
whom she extremely hated, had at first opposed our deliverance with speeches of
gallantry. But at length, seeing her persist too much in her demand, he by an
artificial discourse colored the matter with the public good, and gave the
King a pretext to follow his inclination, by obliging Mariama to retain these
three fair Slaves in her service. It being so resolved then, the King used them
with a great deal of civility, and having demanded of them what we were unto
them? they answered, that we were their brothers, and besought him that we
might not be separated from them. As for us, seeing we might be understood, we
humbly requested the King to entreat us as free men; and to consider that we
had been driven into Marocco by a Tempest; that howsoever if he would
notwithstanding have a ransom of us, we desired he would be pleased to set it
down, to the end we might seek out the means to satisfy him. But thereunto he
answered no otherwise, but that the next day we should receive his pleasure;
and instantly we were conducted to a lodge ng, which was in the outward Court of
the Palace, where we had a Guard set upon us. In the mean time the Princess
Mariama, being moved with the tears and entreaties of these three afflicted
ones, permitted them to remain with us, on condition that they should spend
three or four hours of the day at her lodging, praying them not to be grieved,
and to hope for all things from her assistance.

But, Madam, that you may the better comprehend the sequel of our History, I am
to relate unto you a part of Mariama's, and acquaint you in what estate the
Court of Marocco was at that time. I will not stand for all that to tell you by
what Artifices, two Xeriffes, that is to say amongst them, two holy men, and
descended of the race of their Prophet Mahomet, invaded the two Kingdoms of
Marocco and Taradant; but I will only tell you, that these two Xeriffes, though
they were brothers, could not content themselves with the partition they had
made of their Conquests; and after many breaches of promise on either side,
they came at last to Arms. Whilst they were in good terms together, Hamet, who
was the eldest, and to whom the Kingdom of Marocco was fallen for his share,
had married Mariama, daughter to Mahomet his brother, King of Sus or Taradant,
to Muley Zidan, the eldest of his sons; so that when the War began between
these two brothers, the fair and virtuous Mariama found her self on the party
of her fathers enemy; and whatsoever she could do, it was impossible for her to
make them change their resolution. Seeing then that her prayers, her tears, and
persuasions were all to no purpose with her father-in-law Hamet, and that Muley
Zidan, her husband, told her, how he could not but follow him in this War, who
had given him birth; that he was not an enemy to Mahomet, but only an obedient
son; that it was not for children to ask who were the enemies of those to whom
they owed their lives, but only to hazard them against whomsoever they were,
for the conservation of the lives of them, who had given them theirs. This wise
Princess seeing, I say, things in this estate, abode in Marocco, and without
making vows for the victory, either of the one of the other, she wished that
their Arms would fall out of their hands, and that Reason might be stronger in
them then ambition. But things went not after this sort; for after many
encounters, wherein the Kings of Marocco, and Taradant, had each in their turn
had the better and the worse, the chance of war being fallen in the end on
Hamet, she saw Muley Zidan her Husband return almost alone of all his whole
Army, which had been utterly defeated, and acquaint her with tears in his eyes,
that his Father, and a Brother which he had, named Muley Buacon, were prisoners
in the hands of Mahomet. This virtuous Princess hearing this news, had
generosity enough to weep for the victories of her Father; and when as she saw
that her Husband, after he had assembled together all the Alfaquis, Cavaliers,
and Captains that were in Marocco to advise on that which might be done, found
out no expedient which could be commodious for him, she presented her self unto
the Council, and demanded the permission to go and cast her self at the feet of
Mahomet her Father, to endevor the effecting of a peace; or to offer her self,
and three children she had, for the ransom of Hamet; or to obtain a^ least that
she might serve him during his captivity, if her tears could not move her
Fathers heart.

So generous a proposition was approved of by the whole Assembly; and Muley
Zidan went himself to conduct his wife and his children forth of the Gates of
the City; yet was h^ in some trouble to part with her, out of the fear he was
in, lest Mahomet, knowing how ardently she was beloved of him, should retain
her without rendering up his Father, and without harkening to peace. But she
assured him, that when as she could no longer be useful to her Father-in-law,
nothing but death alone should keep her from returning back to him again. The
voyage of this sage Princess was not fruitless; and albeit that her Father was
one of the greatest Politicians in the World, and one of the most ambitious
Princes on the Earth, yet her Reasons, her Tears, and her Prayers drew him to
grant her the liberty of Hamet and Muley Buacon, and by a Treaty, as reasonable
as if Hamet had not been a prisoner, they contracted a peace which seemed
inviolable.

But scarcely was Mariama re-entred into Marocco as it were in triumph, after
she had brought the King thither again; scarcely had Muley Zidan her Husband
rendered her thanks for so brave an action, but that Hamet began to assemble new
forces, and to say, that whatsoever he had promised in prison, was not to be
kept; and for that effect he went out of Marocco to go and make new Levies
himself; but at this time the victory fell to the juster side. For during
Hamet's absence, Mahomet having been advertised of his designs, came to
Marocco, and made himself Master of the City, partly by force, and partly also
by the revolt of some, who could not approve of Hamet's changings: So that when
he thought to return to Marocco, with Muley Zidan, who had followed after him
with an intent to divert him from the design he had to make war, he understood
that he was a King without a Kingdom; and that the people, who ever follow the
victorious party, had acknowledged Mahomet for King of Marocco. This Prince was
so mightily stricken with this adventure, that abandoning all things he retired
to one, named Cidy Ben Cecy, who lived solitarily in the Mountains, and past
amongst them for a very great and holy person. As for Muley Zidan, he retired
to the King of Fez their confederate.

In the mean time, Mariama, who was in the City when it was taken, carried by
her ordinary generosity, and fearing lest she should have been suspected for
contributing somewhat thereunto, cast her self at her Fathers feet to obtain
leave of him to follow the unfortunate party. And when as he refused her, she
suborned one of the Captains that guarded the gates, and accompanied with two
women, and some of her servants, she got out one night, and went to Cidy Ben
Cecy's retirement. This action so touched Mahomet's heart, as it carried him
once again to treat with his Brother, but it was upon condition, that he should
not re-enter into Marocco, because he had promised so much to the inhabitants,
who feared to be ill-intreated by him.

But not to prolong this discourse any further, you shall understand that Hamet
recommenced the War four or five times, and that so often Mariama obtained his
liberty, and always followed his and her Husbands fortune. Howbeit in the end
Mahomet, after he had conquered the Kingdom of Fez, took him in the last War,
and committed him to close prison, with four of his children, and three of
Mariama's, because he accused Muley Zidan her Husband, for having succored the
King of Fez, whilst he made war upon him: And the unhappy Zidan having been
taken, lost his life, by the command of him, whose daughter he had married.
True indeed it is, that it was by the counsel of Aly, who afterward was
Abdalla's favorite, and in the absence of Mariama, who at that time was not
with her Father. In fine, not to aggravate the sorrow of this excellent
Princess, Mahomet dyed a little while after, and Abdalla the eldest of his
children succeeded him; having ordained by his Testament, that after him the
second of his sons should succeed, and in order all his other brothers, without
any pretense to be made by any of Abdalla's children to the Crowns of Marocco,
Fez, and Taradant, as long as their Uncles lived. At such time as Mahomet dyed,
Abdalla was not at Marocco, so that when the news of his death arrived there,
Aly, who commanded in the City, and was Vizier of the Kingdom, which is the
next dignity to the King, fearing lest the people should revolt, and should
draw Hamet and Mariama's children out of prison, to set them on the Throne
which appertained to them, carried by an inconsiderate zeal, and an extreme
cruelty, caused the unfortunate Hamet, and his children, together with
Mariama's, to be put to death, for the assuring of the Crown to Abdalla, whose
favorite he would be, as he had been Mahomet's. And truly it was not hard for
him to be so; for whereas this man was very great in riches, most mighty in
friends, of an extraordinary courage, having a great deal of prudence and wit,
and much more ambition, there would have been folly, and no little hazard, for
whomsoever would have enterprized to disoblige him.

Abdalla, though grieved with that which Aly had done, yet named it an excess
of zeal and affection, rather then inhumanity; and continuing him in his
Commands, committed unto him almost the whole sway of his Kingdoms. But in some
sort to repair this cruelty, he took care to dry up the tears of the Princess
Mariama, enforced her to return to the Court, made her to be reverenced as the
Queen of all his States, would have persuaded her that Aly was not altogether
culpable of the death of Hamet and her children, and would exact no other thing
of her, but to live in good terms with Aly. This Princess, who was no less
prudent then virtuous, made as if she believed that which the King her Brother
told her, albeit in her heart she bare an irreconciliable hatred to Aly. And
indeed she lived so well with him, without doing any thing for all that
unworthy of her great mind, as it was believed, that the consideration of her
Brother, and her own virtue, had made her forget, that Aly had counseled the
death of her Husband, and had caused her Father-in-law, and her children to be
killed. But you shall perceive by the sequel of this History, that she had
other manner of designs.

Behold then, Madam, the estate wherein the Court of Marocco was at such time
as we were driven thither by tempest. Abdalla was peaceable in his Estates, the
Princess Mariama was very powerful with him, and Aly shared with her in
Abdalla's heart. I think that after this you will the less marvel, when you
shall come to know that this virtuous Princess set her self so strongly and so
readily to protect us, in regard she was carried thereunto, both by her own
virtue, and the hate she bare to Aly, as you shall understand by the sequel of
this discourse. But to come to that which touches us directly, I am to tell
you, that whether Sophronia's extreme affliction had rendered her eyes less
powerful then they used to be, or Leonida's negligence had taken off some of
her charms, or that my sister, having a complexion not so clear as her fellows,
was the more suitable to that of the Country, it was she that made Abdalla and
Aly her Slaves; and who by consequence was the cause that we were so too.

You have promised, said Horatio interrupting him, to be a faithful Historian;
wherefore, without digressing from your subject, relate only the effects of
Hipolita's beauty, and not establish your self the judge thereof. The Marquis
could not forbear laughing at this discourse, no more then Sophronia and
Leonida, nor Hipolita blushing, and all out of different apprehensions: but at
length after some civilities had past betwixt them, Doria continued his
discourse in this sort. Hipolita then having seemed beautiful, both to the
King, and to his Favorite, they had both of them a design not to give liberty
to a person, who had already somewhat engaged theirs: But whereas this first
sense of love was not yet very strong in their soul, they said nothing of it to
one another, and only resolved together, that we should be retained as Slaves;
but whereas ill fortune had brought us to Marocco, and that we were not their
Enemies, but because we were Christians, therefore we should be treated very
gently, yea and hope given us that in time we might obtain our liberty. This
resolution taken, all our Soldiers and Mariners were the next day committed to
safe custody, without any other ill usage offered unto them; and for us, they
contented themselves with leaving us under the guard they had formerly assigned
us, with this difference nevertheless, that we were separated from Sophronia,
Leonida, and Hipolita; for it was Abdalla's absolute pleasure, that they should
abide in the service of the Princess Mariama, and that they should lie in her
lodgings; but with this grace for us, that we should be permitted to go
sometimes and see them, or they to come and visit us. This extraordinary favor
having been granted to us, against the custom of the Country, by the goodness
of Mariama, whom these new Slaves always found ready to render them all kind
of good offices. It is certain that this separation was grievous unto us, and
seeing the terms wherein we stood, we were almost sorry that we had not suffered
shipwreck, at leastwise me-thought I observed such like apprehensions in the
minds of Horatio and Alphonso: But as for the Marquis, it is to be spoken for
his glory, that never man was so soon comforted as he, and I was not a little
surprised, to hear him say laughing, a quarter of an hour after we were
returned from conducting the persons, who were so deer unto us, to the Princess
Mariama's lodgings, that the Affricans Love could tell how to use his how
better, then he of Europe; it being very true, said he, that he had never been
so suddenly stricken to the heart, as he had lately been by the charms of a
sister of the Princess Mariama, who was called Lela Mahabit, only with seeing
her at a window.

For me, said the Marquis interrupting him, who had neither Sister nor Mistress
to grieve for, nor was afflicted but out of a sense of friendship, I am not to
be blamed, if, to render my self more like unto those with whom I conversed, I
suffered my self to be surprised with the passion which possessed their Souls.
If I be always interrupted in this manner, said Doria, i^ will be hard for me
to relate this day that which you desire to know of me. Isabella, finding that
Doria had Reason, made all the company pass their word that they would not
speak any more until he had ended their History; so that every one keeping
silence, and Isabella having renewed her attention, Doria prosecuted his
discourse in this sort.

These new Slaves were no sooner come to the Princess Mariama's lodgings, but
Abdalla, who visited them very often, repaired thither, accompanied with Aly.
And whereas he found her with them, and that therefore they would out of
respect have withdrawn, he would not permit it, telling them that the name of
Slave, which he had imposed upon them, was rather an artifice to retain them
about the Princess his sister, then a design to keep them in servitude. This
complement was seconded by another which Aly used to them, and with a sincere
protestation made to them by Mariama for the treating of them as her sisters,
rather then as her Slaves. This second view yet more augmented the love, which
the King of Marocco and Aly already bore to Hipolita; and whereas Aly was
cunning and dextrous, and had out of a sense of ambition for a long time before
taken great care to observe all Abdalla's motions, he quickly perceived that
the beauty of Hipolita had touched his heart, and that his Master was his
Rival. And whereas he knew very well that Love, no more then Royalty, endures
not any companion, he resolved to conceal from the King the design which he had
in his head. It was not long, before his suspicions were fully cleared; for
Abdalla being become passionately in love, and fearing lest if he should talk
too often with Hipolita, his sister, to whom he carried a great respect, would
come to know his intentions, he opened his heart wholly to Aly, discovered his
passion unto him, conjured him to find out the means to acquaint her with it,
who had caused it. Aly, as we understood afterward, testified a great deal of
joy unto him, for that he being fallen in love, as he said, with one of those
Slaves, he had been so happy as not to prove his Rival. The King demanded of
him then, whether it were so that he loved any of them? and the other answered
him with a false confidence, that Leonida had touched his heart. That which
obliged him to this lie, was his belief, that by this mean the King would never
be jealous of him, nor would fear his falling in love with Hipolita, being
persuaded that his affection was engaged otherwhere; and indeed the matter fell
out as he imagined. The King gave him the conduct of his Love, as well as that
of his Estates; commanded him always to follow him whenever he went to the
Princess Mariama; and not to lose any occasion of speaking to Hipolita
concerning him.

In the mean time, as if Fortune would give a particular persecution to each of
these three fair Slaves, a younger Brother of Abdalla's, named Abdelcadar,
became desperately in love with Sophronia. For the rest of us, except it were
the Marquis, we had no new passion; and mishap in this encounter, appeared not
to us at first, but in the semblance of good fortune. The King sent to visit us
with presents, and many times made us come to his lodgings for to entertain
him. Aly resorted to us himself, and assured us of his protection: We had also
the liberty to see and speak with our sisters, or to say better, our
Mistresses; for in these occasions, love always prevailed over friendship.

In fine, the greatest of our unquietnesses was, that we could not foresee the
end of our present felicities, nor divine wherefore they treated us so
favorably, and yet would not deliver us. Howbeit we were not long without
discovering it, for the King's and Aly's love still augmenting, whereas
gallantry seems to be natural to all the Moors, they were willing to restore
Hipolita to her former joy, before they would speak to her of their passion.
For notwithstanding all the caresses which these fa^r maids received from the
Princess Mariama, and the affection which they carried to her, yet melancholy
appeared still in all their discourses, and in all their actions: So that to
delight them, there were nothing bu^ public feasts, turneys, balls, and
rejoycings. But in all these encounters Aly so carried the matter, as all the
parties, whereof he was the Head, were, both braver, and more magnificent, then
that of others, without the Kings ever suspecting any thing of his true intent,
because his mind was prepossest with the opinion, that it was Leonida he was
in love withal, and not Hipolita. And surely he should have been very
melancholique, that could not have taken pleasure in these assemblies, it being
certain, that nothing is seen which is more agreeable even in Europe,
especially for dancing. For whereas, since the desolation of Granado, many
persons of quality retired to Fez, Tunis, and Marocco, though the remembrance
of their misfortunes ought to have made them renounce all manner of delights,
yet their desire to please Abdalla who protected them, caused them to be
present at all these feasts. And truly I do not marvel, if the Spaniards in
conquering their Kingdom, though they be conquerors severe enough, have not
forborne taking some of their gallantries, chiefly that dance, called Sarabanda:
But it must be acknowledged that they are but bad imitators of them, no more
then we, who have taken it from the Spaniards; it being most certain that they
dance it in a manner wherein there is so much art and grace, as we come nothing
near it. And whereas out of a particular favor we were present at all these
feasts, I remember one amongst the rest, wherein the Marquis made an end of
losing his liberty by a Sarabanda, which the Princess Lela Mahabit danced. For
whereas all the features of her face were excell^nt, her eyes sparkling and
passionate, her shape advantag^ous and comely, her carriage free and
majestical, although the color of her skin was not v^ry agreeable, yet her
whole person together appeared infinitely pleasing in this Assembly, where she
danced a Sarabanda with a negligenc^ so full of charms, with so graceful a
disposition, and so gallant and amorous an air, as the Marquis was in a mind
solemnly to renounce his ordinary humor, and b^come constant for this Princess.

And to testify unto you, how great an impression she made in his heart, I
only can tell you, that in four days the Marquess, who was d^sirous to
transform himself into the person beloved as much as possibly he could, learned
this dance so miraculously, that having demanded permission of Aly to
intermingle himself amongst a Troop of Granadins, who were to dance disguised
in one of these Assemblies, he charmed all the company in such sort, as the
Princess Lela Mahabid, who was an equitable Judge of such like things, would
needs know who he was: But she was much amazed, when as she perceived that he
was not a Granadin, but one of the favorite Slaves, for so we were called;
Sophronia, Leonida, and Hipolita were no less then she, to see that they had
admired him without knowing him, never dreaming it should be he, though they
discerned him not amongst us. In the mean time this adventure was not
displeasing to her, for after that, there past not an Assembly (and there was
one almost every day) wherein he spoke not to her, wherein he danced not before
her, and wherein with his adress, and accustomed confidence, he gave her not
some mark of his affection, yet without passing those bounds of respect which
he owed to her. But whereas all these Feasts were made upon design, the King
solicited Aly to sp^ak to Hipolita of his love, which he did soon after, but in
such a manner, as seemed at first sight infinitely to oblige my sister: For
after a reasonable long discourse he besought her to consider what he owed to
the King his M^ster, to the end that afterward she might receive that which he
was going to say to her, as a pure effect of his obedience to Abdalla, and not
as a matter he approved of. He told her then, that he had such a particular
esteem of her, as he would rather expose himself to the hazard of losing his
life and his fortune, then to that of displeasing her.

In fine, after a preparation long enough, and when as he believed that he had
given sufficient good impressions of his virtue to Hipolita, he told her that
her beauty had touched the heart of Abdalla, and that he had commanded him to
acquaint her with his love; but, said he unto her with a seeming sincerity,
whereas you can never be but his Slave, Heaven shield me from contributing
ought to so bad a design; contrarily, I will do my uttermost to hinder such a
misfortune; and that you may furnish me with means to serve you, make known to
the King, added he, if he happens to speak with you, that I have acquitted my
self of the commission which he gave me; in the mean time assure your self that
there is not any thing which I will not undertake for your service.

Hipolita was strangely surprised with this discourse, for coming to consider
all Abdalla's liberalities, and the manner wherein he had lived with her for a
good while before, she made no qu^stion but that Aly's discourse was true.
Nevertheless, whereas she is natu^ally suspicious and mistrustful, she doubted
of Aly's sincerity in some things; howbeit she answered civilly enough to the
offers he had made her; but for so much as regarded the Kings love, she spoke
to him with so much firmness, as he seemed to be very blank at it. It was not
because he desired she should accept of Abdalla's love, but seeing in what
manner she refused the Kings affection, he feared lest when he should come to
discover his own, he should be worse entreated. And whereas Hipolita perceived
his unquietness; for what reason, said she unto him, are you afflicted to see
me resolved to oppose my self with all my power against an affection which you
seem not to approve of? It is, answered Aly, with as much cunning as malice,
because knowing by your discourse, how much that which I have used to you has
troubled your mind, I cannot choose but grieve for that the King has picked out
to persecute you, the only man in the world that honors you most: But believe,
fair Hipolita, continued he, that this unjust love touches me as much as you,
and that there is not any thing which I will not do to deliver you from it.
After this Aly quitted her, and left her in such an unquietness, as the like
was scarcely ever heard of. Not only the Kings affection afflicted her; not
only the sadness, which she had observed in Aly's face, troubled her; not only
the incertainty wherein she was whether she should discover Abdalla's love to
the Princess Mariama, disquieted her; but an odd and altogether extraordinary
jealousy put her mind upon the rack. She did not complain of Horatio's looking
on any other person; she did not accuse him of infidelity, but she was jealous
because he was not jealous: For when as Aly talked to her, she had marked how
Horatio's eyes were still fixed on her, and albeit he had seen that man
entertain her a long time, yet had he not appeared the more unquiet for it. And
as it is the custom of passionate persons to aggravate things, according to the
apprehensions which they have, so Hipolita had the injustice to believe, that
her Lover must needs perceive the Kings love, which she her self had not known.
If he loved me ardently, said she (for she declared it unto us afterward) the
fear of losing me would have made him fear all things; he would have taken
notice of the Kings civilities; his liberalities would have been suspected unto
him; I should have seen some unquietness in his eyes, when as Aly talked so
earnestly to me: in fine, concluded she in her heart, either he loves me not,
or he loves me but a little; and if he loves me but a little, he loves me not
at all, since love never endures any mediocrity.

Whilst she reasoned in this manner, Aly, who d^sired to persuade the King
that he was in love with Leonida, took great care that notice might be taken
how she was pleasing to him. And whereas Alphonso has not by nature so quiet a
mind as Horatio, he seemed to us almost is much troubled as Hipolita, though it
were in a diff^rent manner. He was not jealous of Leonida, but he was vexed to
think that Aly was amorous of her. He did not fear that she would be unfaithful
to him, but he was angry that another was passionate for her; it being his
humor, as I conceive, that the person whom he loves should never see any but
him, nor should be seen of any but him. As for me, that am of a contrary mind;
that would have all the Earth raise up altars to my Mistress; that cannot be
jealous no more then Horatio; that places all my felicity in having Rivals, to
the end I may possess the glory of being better entreated then they, and may no
longer doubt, but that I am loved as well out of choice, as out of inclination;
I saw Abdelcader, as long as this Assembly lasted, employ all his address to
please the fair Sophronia, without being troubled at it; but contrarily I
beheld with pleasure the admiration which her beauty put him into, as well as
all the rest of the company, and it seemed unto me, that in commending her,
they commended my judgment, and augmented my glory.

Behold, Madam, in what sort this Assembly ended; The King retired with a great
deal of impatience to know what answer Hipolita had given to Aly; this false
Confident very sorry for having encountered with so much firmness in my sisters
mind; Sophronia sufficiently displeased with Abdelcader's complacency; Leonida
in a humor of laughing at the affection which Aly seemed to bear her; Alphonso
netled with having a Rival, though he would not acknowledge it to us; the
Marquess exceedingly contented with having a Mistress; Lela Mahabid well
satisfied with the Marquess his gallantry; Horatio with a mind indifferent
enough for all that had past; and I sufficiently contented in our misfortune,
and even with a secret sense of joy, to see that the beauty of Sophronia was so
perfect, as she made her self be adored of all Nations.

In the mean time, the Princess Mariama, who has a quick and piercing wit,
perceived all the diverse interests of this Assembly: and though she could not
discover them perfectly, yet knew she that the King was in some passion; that
Aly was not exempted from it; that Abdelcader her bro^her did not hate
Sophronia; and that Lela Mahabid was too civil toward a Slave. This wise
Princess resolved for all that, not to make any show of all these things, till
she was more certain of them; but it was not long before she was deared
therein. For my sister being retired with her companions, and having acquainted
them with Aly's discourse, they resolved to advertise the Princess Mariama of
it, and absolutely to confide in her virtue. Sophronia was notwithstanding of
the opinion, to ask counsel of us first; so that the next morning, according to
the permission they had for it, they sent for us. And when as Sophronia had
propounded the matter unto us, and that I began already to give my advice, Let
Horatio speak first, said Hipolita unto me, with precipitation enough; for if
to give good counsel one has need of a quiet mind, it may well be said that he
is in such an estate as he ought to be, to counsel us as we should be. Were it
true, replied Horatio mightily surprised, that I had a quiet mind, the manner
wherewithal you have spoken is enough to trouble it in such sort, as to render
me incapable of counselling others. Since your rest is so dear unto you,
answered she, as you even seek a pretext not to assist afflicted persons with
your advice, leave us at leastwise to think of what we have to do. Horatio
seeing her so bitter, would not answer her out of prudence and respect, for
fear lest her fantastical humor should appear too visibly unto us. As for me,
who comprehended nothing in this discourse, I said unto my sister half
laughing, that I believed the King of Marocco's love had possessed her with
pride, rather then with melancholy, if she continued speaking in that fashion.
But in the end we resolved, that these four Slaves should absolutely confide in
the Princess Mariama, for fear lest if they should not advertise her of the
truth of the matter, she might have cause to think, should she discover it some
other way, that it was not displeasing to them, since they made a mystery of
it. We conceived that from her alone they were to hope for their protection,
and their liberty, and consequently that it was requisite they should make all
their virtue known to this Princess; who out of sympathy and conformity, would
without doubt be always carried to serve them.

After we had a long time reasoned of all these things; after that Sophronia
had acquainted us with her new Conquest, and Leonida with that which she
thought she had made; after, I say, we had spoken of all this in general,
Horatio, who desired to know what he was accused of, separated Hipolita
dexterously from us, and having led her to a window, where she leaned, he
conjured her to tell him what had obliged her to speak with so much bitterness
unto him, (at leastwise he related it so unto us,) I know full well, said he
unto her, that I am not faulty; but I do not know of what crime I am accused:
Be so good unto me then as to acquaint me with it, that I may justify my self;
but if you will have me speak like an offender, although I be none, let me know
what fault I have committed, to the end I may repent me of it, and amend it.
You may peradventure do the former, answered she, but it is impossible for you
to do the other. I have a long time known, that there would be some injustice
in accusing you of an insensibility, which you cannot choose but have; howbeit I
cannot also choose but complain of my hard fortune, in having a mind so sensible
for a man, that is so little himself. The more you complain, said Horatio unto
her, the less do I comprehend of what fault I am accused; for to say that the
beautiful Hipolita does not touch my heart sensibly, and that she alone makes
not up my felicity, is a thing without all likelihood. You have reason, said
she unto him with a bitter smile; Hipolita can do something upon your felicity,
but she can do nothing upon your misfortune: She can sometimes with a favorable
look, or with her discourses, give you happy moments, but she can never with
her coldness, or the love that she shows to others, beget any sadness in you:
verily, continued she, you are the happiest Lover that ever was; nothing
displeases you, nothing molests you; neither fear nor jealousy trouble you;
you hope without unquietness; you desire without impatience, and of all the
thoughts which Love inspires, you know none without doubt, but those that lead
to joy. You interpret all things, as you say, to the advantage of the person
beloved; but to speak more reasonably, it is to the disadvantage of your love:
For whosoever loves truly, can never hold himself so assured of the person whom
he loves, but that fear will be stronger in him then hope; now for your part,
you hope all things, and fear nothing. It is certain, said Horatio unto her,
that you oftentimes reduce me to an estate of fearing nothing, and of having
recourse unto hope to comfort me. For in fine, whereas the greatest of
misfortunes is to see you in choler, I behold my self so many times exposed
thereunto, that I have nothing else to fear. No, no, said Hipolita unto him,
you are yet more ingenuous then so; my very choler gives you joy; you regard
it as a mark of my affection; and thus making profit of all things, you are
never unhappy. Might it please Heaven, said he unto her, that you spoke true!
Confess to me, added she interrupting him, that if I had said nothing to you of
the long conversation which I had yesterday with Aly, whether you would have
suspected any thing of it. Any other but you would have been troubled at it,
continued she, and whereas love renders the mind clear-sighted, you would have
imagined something of the truth. But as for you, doubtless you believed that he
entertained me with the Government of the King of Marocco's State; that policy
was the object of our conversation, whilst you could in the mean time look
without unquietness upon the Princess Lela Mahabid, because she danced with a
good grace. Are these, rigorous Hipolita, said Horatio unto her, all the crimes
which I have committed? Have I done nothing but see you talking with Aly,
without divining what he said unto you, and without afflicting my self at it?
No, answered she, you have done nothing else; but this indifferency, or to say
better, this insensibility, and this stupid love so vexes me, as in the state
whereunto it has reduced my mind for a long time together, I had rather see
you desperately in love with another, then to see you so quiet: for either the
spite of your change would set me at rest; or if I had not resolution enough
for that, I should say in flattering my self, he will come out of his error, he
will repent him of his inconstancy, and since he can tell how to love, he may
be capable of returning and repenting, and of having as much affection for me,
as he has for another. But in the case wherein I see you at this present, you
will be always insensible and always happy, and I always unfortunate. That
cannot be, answered Horatio, my destiny and yours are not separated so easily.
But, amiable Hipolita, why will you not have me live innocently, why will you
have me render my self faulty, in suspecting you amiss? Why will you have me
make my self unhappy voluntarily, and abandoning Reason, form monsters to my
self to combat withal? and why will you not on the contrary have me confide in
your virtue, rely on your fidelity, and without rendering me unfortunate, suffer
me to be in some rest? Would you know, said Hipolita unto him, why I will not
have it so, it is because I do not seek in you for a Wiseman, and a
Philosopher, but for a Lover. Love has a Reason, which is wholly particular
unto it; reasonable persons, who are touched with this passion, never abandon
Virtue for it, but withal they do not follow that severe Reason, which will
have one receive with an equal temper, both good and bad fortune. Love ought to
be stronger then Reason; it does not destroy it, but it troubles it. I blush,
Horatio, at that which I say, and at the grief I am in, for that if I am to
know these things, it has not been rather by your actions, then by mine own
experience, that I have understood them. You ought to have taught me, that love
is suspicious, impatient, unquiet, and curious; that it wishes for that which
it has not; that it fears to lose that which it possesses; you ought to
have learnt me, that none of the actions of the person beloved can be
indifferent; that she alone ought to be more considerable, then all the world
besides; and that the only desire to please her, and the fear to offend her,
should make a Lover act. By this reason, answered Horatio, I should not dare to
accuse you, no not when you had given me occasion to complain, being persuaded
that all those words of cruel, unjust, and inexorable, ought not to be said to
a worthy person, but in songs, and if it were possible for me to be angry with
you, respect should force me to conceal it. You are in an error, replied she,
choler and jealousy are the true marks of love, and provided that one does
not continue in them, one never offends the person whom one loves; but you
speak so, because you know not how to love. Nay but I speak in his sort,
answered Horatio, because I know how to love well, and that I respect you.
Respect, replied Hipolita, can be but a mark of esteem, and not a mark of love:
And tell me, I pray you, by what way pretend you to testify yours unto me. In
protesting to you, answered Horatio, that you are all my felicity; in
absolutely remitting unto you the conduct of my fortune; and in assuring you
that I would lose my life with joy for your service. One may do all these
things out of esteem, and out of generosity, replied she, but one can never be
jealous without love; all other passions may receive interpretations, but this
same leaves no room to doubt of the cause of it; and jealousy is the only
assured mark of this passion. If I could cease from esteeming of you, replied
Horatio, I should be jealous, I should be unquiet. Say, answered she lifting up
her voice, and quitting him, that if you could cease from being insensible, you
should be a Lover. She spoke this so loud, as Sophronia, Leonida, the Marquess,
Alphonso, and I, heard her, and we judged that there was some little disorder
between them, especially when I saw a Carnation color on my sisters cheeks,
which used not to be there, and a certain constrained and artificial smile,
which anger always produces in her face. Sophronia willing to play the good
sister in this occasion would needs know their dispute; and when as Horatio had
recounted it unto her, notwithstanding Hipolita's resistance to the contrary,
we made their peace, after they had on either part said all that their wit and
passion could furnish them with.

Thereupon we retired to our lodging, and these three fair Slaves to the
Princess Mariama's; where after the first civilities they besought her to give
them a particular audience. Mariama, having granted them their demand,
commanded her women to leave her alone; which was no sooner done, but the fair
Sophronia, who had in charge to speak in the name of all the three, requested
her to remember the promise she had made to protect them; and then she related
unto her the discourse which Aly had used to Hipolita and Leonida: but not able
to obtain so much confidence from her modesty, as to tell her withal, that
Abdelcader had testified a great deal of affection to her, my sister acquainted
the Princess with the conquest that Sophronia had made. Mariama being very much
satisfied with their freedom and their virtue, redoubled the care and good will
which she had for them; and to show that she put as much confidence in their
discretion, as they done in hers: and to let them see also, how much interest
she had to oppose all the bad designs of Aly, she recounted all his adventures
unto them, namely, all that I imparted to you at the beginning of this History:
And thereupon assured them, that whatsoever came from a spirit so artificial as
Aly's, was ever to be suspected. She told them moreover, that whereas he did
always work with cuning, he was always to be dealt with in the same manner: that
to that effect, great care was to be taken to keep him from discovering, that
they had acquainted her either with the Kings love, or his; that it was
likewise requisite, that Hipolita should seem to place some confidence in that
false generosity, which he had feigned to have in speaking to her of the Kings
love. For, said Mariama unto them, I know Aly, he would never have dealt in that
sort with Hipolita, had not some passion, more powerful then his malice,
carried him thereunto. Hitherto he has never contraried the King in any thing;
hitherto he has affected a blind obedience to all his will, and an exterior
fidelity, which has not permitted me as yet to revenge the mischiefs he has
done me. Nevertheless I see something in his heart, since the time that I have
obtained of my self to speak with him oftener then I used to do, which puts me
in hope that I shall find the means for it. In fine, believe it, said she to
Hipolita, that Aly has not declared the Kings love unto you, and promised to
protect you against him, without some secret reason that induces him thereunto,
and without some particular interest. But for discovery, we must dissemble as
well as he, and not speak so severely of the love which he says the King bears
you, that we may see what he will be at. Leonida, for her part, must endevor to
discover his designs; and Sophronia, carrying her self according to her humor
and her virtue, will no doubt punish Abdelcader rigorously enough, for
suffering himself to be surprised by the splendour of her beauty; howbeit I will
take care that he shall no longer importune her. In the mean time, continued
she, fear no violence, unless it be from Aly; for touching the King, I know
that he has some respect to my person, and does carefully endevor to make me
forget the cruelties which Aly has done, under the pretext of assuring the
Crown unto him. And grant also that the wickedness of this man should prove
contageous to the King, be assured that I will never abandon you, and will
hazard all things to keep you from having any violence offered unto you.

These fair Slaves gave her thanks for a discourse that was so advantageous
unto them; commended her virtue and her generosity; lamented the misfortunes
that had arrived unto her; detested the cruelty of Aly: and making an exchange
of their own sorrows, it might have been said that Mariama felt their miseries
more then her own; and that these fair Slaves, who were no less generous, nor
less sensible then she, had as much sense of her past fortunes as of their
present mishaps.

After that so sad a conversation had lasted some time, and that out of the
compassion, which they had one of another, they had in some sort mitigated
their griefs, the Princess Mariama told them smiling, how it would not be just,
that whilst she was thinking of their protection, one of their Troop should
undertake to revenge Hipolita of the Kings love, with another love; desiring
them to advertise the Slave, which danced with so good a grace, that the
Princess Lela Mahabid was her sister; because she believed, that either he knew
not so much, or that he had forgotten it. Sophronia perceiving by Mariama's
speech, that she meant the Marquis; and that she also had taken notice of his
inclination to the Princess Lela Mahabid, thought it was best to acquaint her
with his humor, to the end she might not be offended if he continued the
gallantry he had begun. Sophronia then drew the Marquis his picture so
agreeably, and so advantageously for him, as the Princess told her that she was
very glad of the conquest her sister had made, and that she might in some sort
share with her there^n, it was fit she should more particularly know so
extraordinary a man: and so, the Princess Mariama, and Sophronia, became his
Confidents, without having any purpose to be so, and procured him the pleasure
to see the Princess Lela Mahabid almost every day at the Princess Mariama's
lodging. The first time he was there, I remember that we brought him thither
with some kind of repugnancy; for he had understood from Sophronia her self,
in what manner she had spoken of him. It is not, said he unto us, because I am
angry that Sophronia has spoken the truth; but it is because I do not feel my
self in a disposition to make it appear by experience, that I am as inconstant
as she has described me: it being very certain, that I am persuaded I cannot
love any think here but the Princess Lela Mahabid.

With this little vexation the Marquis was brought to Mariama's lodging, where
all those fair Slaves were present, as well as the Princess Lela Mahabid, who
received him with a great deal of civility. At first Mariama commended his
address, and rememb'ring how admirably he had danced in the last Assemblies,
she marvelled how he could in so short a space surmount all the Moors in
gallantry and a good grace. The Moors, said he unto her, Madam, have not had so
good a Master as I. And when as Mariama had demanded of him, who he was? he
answered her, that Love had taught him all that he knew; it being most sure, as
he said, that without him he had been the ignorantest of all men. For,
continued he, the sole desire to please the person whom I loved has taught me
all that I know. If that be so, answered Mariama, and that which has been told
me of you be true, you should be one of the most universally knowing men in the
world, since by that reason, the diversity of persons whom you have loved,
should have taught you a wonderful diversity of things.

Truly, Madam, you have Reason, replied he, but that which makes me know them
but superficially, is, because I have stayed so little a while in one school, as
I have had no more leisure then to learn to speak a little of things, without
any perfect knowledge of them. The first person, of whom I was enamored, loved
valor, and that was the cause why I took care not to appear cowardly. She that
touched my heart next loved music, and instantly I learned to sing, to play
on the Lute and the Gittern. Another, placing her greatest delight in reading
of verses, inspired me with the desire of making some. One of my Mistresses,
loving Romanzes above any thing else, possessed me with the desire to furnish
the subject of one with mine own adventures. I learned also to be fit for all
compliance; I became a Painter, an Astrologer, and a Mathematician: Love made
me learn languages; by him I grew many times eloquent, liberal, discreet, and
pleasing; in fine, I do not know a virtue, for which I am not indebted to this
noble passion.

I profess, said the Princess Mariama, that this is the finest way of
commending ones self that ever was heard of. But, said she to the Marquis, how
comes it to pass, that in so little a time as you have been here, you have so
perfectly attained to that, which the Granadins, who are our masters in
gallantry, are so long a learning? for, as you say your self, there are things
which you understand but superficially, because your love to those that
affected them was not long enough. It is, Madam, answered he, because I have at
this present a greater desire to please, then ever I had in all my life.

She that has given you this desire, said the Princess Lela Mahabid unto him,
should have a great deal of merit, or should be very much obliged to you. She
has so many excellent qualities, replied the Marquis, as I may say, that in
this illustrious person I love all those whom I have loved in all my lifetime:
it being most certain, that I have never admired any thing in all the others,
whom I have served, which I do not find yet more eminently in her whom now I
adore. She is wonderfully fair; she has a spirit as full of brightness, as her
eyes are of light; and there is seen in her whole person, a charm so powerful
and so extraordinary, that it is impossible to conserve so much reason, as to
remember that one ought not to have any other then veneration for her; one must
of necessity give place to love; she cannot inspire other thoughts; and not
working like ordinary beauties, which makes one pass from admiration to esteem,
and from esteem to love, she renders her self at the first instant absolute
Mistress of all their souls that behold her. One cannot have indifferent
thoughts for her; one must, either not see her, or adore her: and from the very
first moment that I beheld her, I had all at once both admiration, esteem, and
love. I was no longer mine own, I was absolutely hers; and though I know full
well that I am unworthy of this honor, yet can I not imagine that I am faulty.
It seems to me also (at leastwise I flatter my self with this opinion) that by
a particular privilege, and to render her conquests the more illustrious, she
purifies all the hearts which she enflames; that she darts forth a beam of that
divinity which I adore in her, and therewith illuminates them that come near
her; that in making her virtues known, she communicates a part of them; and
that one is no sooner her Slave, but he is worthy to command others.

The Princess Lela Mahabid, not able to forbear from blushing at the Marquis
his discourse, would at leastwise make a gallantry of it. I leave you to judge,
said she unto him, how much you would make your Mistresses modesty to suffer,
if she were here, since I could not choose but change color at this excessive
praise, though I have no part in it. I fear, Madam, replied he, that in this
occasion you take one virtue for another; and that this change, which has
appeared in your face, be not rather an effect of your great heart, then of
your modesty, seeing it may be you take it not well, that a Slave should lose
the respect which he ows you, so far, as to dare to entertain you with his
passion. You speak so agreeably hereof, said the Princess Mariama interrupting
him, that if my sister will be persuaded by me, she shall always be your
Confident. I am not inconsiderate enough for that, answered the Marquis; and
the thoughts of respect and adoration which I have for her, will not permit me
to commit this fault.

Sophronia, seeing that hereupon there was a great silence amongst the company,
which might trouble the Marquis, said to him with a great deal of address, that
she was glad to see a passion in him, which made her hope that at last he might
be constant; since finding in a person whom he loved, all the beauties of the
body, all the graces of the mind, and all the virtues of the soul, it was
impossible for him to meet with any thing that was amiable in another, which
was not in her. You have Reason, answered the Marquis, but not altogether to
renounce my natural inclination, though I love none, or to say better, adore
none, but this excellent person, yet have I found the means to mingle an
inconstancy with the love I bear her, whereof she cannot be jealous. I have
much ado to conceive this new mystery, added my sister; and I do not think,
that she, who is the cause of your love, will reign in a divided heart. My
heart is wholly hers, replied the Marquis, and to explain my thoughts unto you,
know, that the person, whom I adore, is so marvelous, as it would be a crime in
me, having but one heart and one affection, to offer to love all that is
amiable in her at one and the same time: so that to love her the more
perfectly, and in some sort also to follow this inclination, which predominates
over all mine, I give every day a new object to my passion. To day I adore her
eyes; to morrow I love the beauty of her shape, the next day I suffer my self
to be charmed with the graces of her mind; another time her goodly aspect
ravishes me; and by this means yielding my heart wholly to each of those
excellent qualities which she possesses, I shall love her as much as she
deserves to be; and without being inconstant to her, I shall yet be always so
much, as never to be weary of my servitude. This new way of loving so mightily
surprised all the company, as albeit they had no great cause of joy, yet could
they not forbear laughing at it. I should never have done, if I should rehearse
all the pleasing passages, which the Marquis delivered in all the visits which
he gave to these two Princesses; it shall suffice then to tell you, that the
Princess Lela Mahabid had all the esteem and all the affection for him, which a
Princess, gallant enough, and who for all that was virtuous, was capable of.

In the mean time you are to know, that Aly had not failed in rendering an
account to the King of the commission which he had given him: but whereas he
was a Lover and cunning, he had disguised the truth of that which he had said
to Hipolita, and of that which Hipolita had answered him. For though my sister
had testified sufficiently unto him, that Abdalla's affection could never
please her, yet he feared that if the King should undertake to speak to her
himself, she might at length be persuaded; so that to keep him from it, he told
him, that albeit Hipolita had not favorably received the declaration which he
had made her of his love, yet he held it not absolutely impossible to touch her
heart; it having seemed unto him how he had observed, that the greatest fear
Hipolita had, was lest the Princess Mariama should perceive this affection.
Wherefore, my Lord, said he unto him, it must be by me that she must be
acquainted with all the thoughts which you have for her, until such time as by
great hopes we have chased away this fear from her heart. For there is no
doubt, added he, considering the estate wherein I saw her mind, if you
enterprise to speak to her your self, but you will be very ill satisfied of
her, for the reason I have told you.

Abdalla, though very amorous, and consequently very impatient and very
suspicious, yet made do question of Aly's discourse; and remitting himself
absolutely to his conduct, he conjured him to remember, that on the conquest of
Hipolita all his felicity depended. In the mean while, albeit he had promised
Aly to g^ve my sister the least testimony of his affection that he could, yet
was it impossible for him to conceal his passion: for he no sooner entered into
Mariama's lodging, but he asked for Hipolita; he no sooner saw her, but a new
joy appeared in his face; Hipolita's looks guided his whether he would or no;
he followed her with his eyes wheresoever she went; and seldom did he make a
visit without praising some beauty, or some virtue, which he said he had not
yet marked in her. These praises did not please Aly at the beginning,
nevertheless seeing he could not hinder them, whereas sovereign prudence, or to
say better, extreme cunning, consists in making all things serve for the design
that one has, he labored to draw some advantage from the love, which the King
seemed to bear to Hipolita. But before I acquaint you with it, I am to tell
you, that after many conversations which he had with her, wherein he always
showed, how much he esteemed of her virtue, and approved of the refusals she
had made of the Kings love; one day, when as he found her the most civilly
disposed for him (as he thought) and the most incensed against the King, he
undertook to discover unto her the passion he was in for her. And whereas she
was exceedingly surprised with such a kind of discourse, and has naturally an
imperious spirit; Is it possible, said she unto him, that you can speak to me
in this sort, and conserve any memory and judgment? Do you believe, added she,
that a person, which refuses the affection of your King, can receive yours? Do
you not remember, that you have an hundred times commended the resolution which
I have taken to dye, rather then to satisfy him? shall I be more virtuous, in
harkening favorably to your love, then to Abdalla's? What part do you play,
said she unto him, without giving him time to interrupt her? You betray your
Master in speaking to me of your love; and if you will pass for my Lover, you
do me an injury in charging your self with moving the Kings to me: and
howsoever it be, I ought to hate and despise you more then him.

After Hipolita had testified all her resentment and her anger, Aly, nothing
daunted, not displeased, besought her not to condemn him without hearing. For,
fair Hipolita, said he unto her, it may be you will find some difference
between the love that Abdalla bears you, and that which I bear you: He only
loves the beauty of Hipolita, and I adore the virtue of Hipolita. He is not
your servant, but to make you his Slave; and I do not love you, but to marry
you. His flame is unjust, and mine is lawful; the end of his love is his own
satisfaction, and that of mine is your glory, and your conservation. For in
fine, continued he, if it be true that you love honor, you will have some
indulgence for the affection which I carry to you; seeing there tests no other
mean to warrant you from the violences of Abdalla's love, but that of receiving
the same which I offer you. I acknowledge, said he further to her, that I am an
ill subject, but it is not but to be a faithful Lover, and because I will not
expose you to the greatest miseries, which a virtuous person can suffer. For,
if you will, said he unto her, all the Kings love, all his force, and all his
power, shall not keep me, from protecting and marrying you.

Aly having made an end of speaking, left Hipolita, for that he would not have
her, said he, answer him without advisement, in a matter whereon all his
happiness or unhappiness depended. From thence he went to the Princess Mariama,
to whom in appearance he bore a great deal of respect. And whereas for some
time past, this Princess had given him more commodity to speak to her then
before, out of the design she had to discover his intentions concerning him
that was to succeed Abdalla, it was not difficult for him to talk with her in
private; so that after he had protested an inviolable fidelity to her, and had
sworn to her, that next to the glory and interests of Abdalla, nothing in the
world was so dear to him as hers; he told her, that knowing her exceeding
virtue and prudence, he thought he was obliged to acquaint her, how the King
was so desperately in love with Hipolita, as he feared that his passion would
carry him to lose the respect which he owed to her, in drawing him to use some
violence to this maid: That if in this occasion he might be permitted to give
advertisements and counsel both together, he conceived that the best course
could be taken, would be to remove Hipolita out of the way, or to marry her;
That, as her Slave, she might dispose of her, without the Kings having any
lawful pretext to contradict her, since he himself had bestowed her on her.

The Princess received this discourse of Ala's, as if she were obliged to him
for it; and although she knew not as yet the interest which he had in this
affair, because she had not seen Hipolita; yet she believed that this
generosity, which appeared in his speech, was not in his heart: She thanked him
notwithstanding for the advice he had given her; promised him to observe the
Kings and Hipolita's actions; and then told him, that she would resolve of
nothing in this affair, without demanding his counsel about it; and that he on
his part should not fail to advertise her of all that he knew. Aly, to let the
Princess see that he lied not, desired her to call to mind all the testimonies
of unquietness and affection, which the King could not conceal in the visits he
had rendered her for some time past. And when as she had told him that she
remembered them very well, he went very well satisfied of her. For knowing the
virtue and prudence of this Princess, he doubted not but that now understanding
the love which the King bore to Hipolita, she would oppose it with all her
power; and so, if it happened that Hipolita should tell her the pr^position he
had made to marry her, she would not contradict it; because it would be a mean
to keep the King from committing a fault; and because she would believe also by
this way to put him out of grace with Abdalla, which he feared not much, in
regard that all the force of the Kingdom was in his hands; that all the
Governors of Places dep^nded on him; and that it was impossible for Abdalla to
rid himself of him, but by taking away his life; which he stood in no doubt of,
for he could not imagine, that a Prince to whom he had conserved the Crown,
could make him lose his head. And after this manner he resolved to make a show
of confiding in the Princess Mariama; judging that nothing could arrive therein
that would not be advantageous to him.

In the m^an time Abdelcader had his designs both of love and ambition, as well
as Aly; and though he was no very excellent Prince, yet the desire of reigning
is so natural in men, as it found a place in his heart, and so much the more
strongly, because he knew that according to equity the Crown of Marocco
appertained to him after the death of his brother, though Abdalla had a son;
for that the Xeriff Mahomet had so ordained by his Testament. In this thought,
he had a long time already very much courted Aly, to the end he might gain him
as much as he could; out of the hope that if Abdalla came to dye, he would side
with him, or at leastwise remain a neuter between the son of Abdalla and him.

Nevertheless, whereas at that time Aly had other designs, he never said any
thing to Abdelcad^r, which might make him hope for ought from him. But whereas
he was dextrous, and knew not certainly whether he should let Abdalla's son
reign, or reign himself, he had never disobliged him, but was contented to tell
him still, upon the diverse propositions which he had made unto him, that for
matters regarding the State, he was not the servant of the person of Abdalla,
but of the King of Marocco; That as for him, he was persuaded, how it was
neither reason, nor justice, that ordinarily made Kings, but Fortune only; And
without considering whether she were blind or no in the distribution of Crowns,
he was resolved always to serve the State with fidelity, in the person of those
whom she would place on the Throne of Marocco. But in the terms wherein things
then were, he nevertheless altered his mind, albeit he had an hundred times
promised Abdalla, if he should happen to dye before him, to conserve the Crown
for his son, to the prejudice of Abdelcader: And whereas Aly undertook not this
d^sign, but for his particular interest, for in making a young King to reign,
he should in a manner be King himself; that interest coming to change, he also
changed his resolution. For after he had well examined both the Kings love and
his own, he found that what industry soever he could use, it would be
impossible for him to marry Hipolita with Abdalla's consent; who should no
sooner be incensed against him, but the Princess Mariama, joining her credit
and address to the just occasion she had to wish him ill, would no doubt
constrain him to have recourse to extreme remedies.

With such like thoughts it was that Aly had entertained himself a good while
already, when as Abdelcader, who believed he was in love with Leonida, and
consequently hoped, that he would excuse the passion he had for Sophronia, came
unto him with an intent dexterously to learn of him what designs he had for that
maid, to the end he might rule his by those of a man, who, as he believed,
durst not condemn that in another, which he suffered in himself.

All their conversation at first was but of indifferent things, and of the
beauty of Mariama's Slaves. And whereas Aly was not ignorant of Abdelcader's
passion for Sophronia, he was willing in this occasion to incense the mind of
this Prince against Abdalla, and wholly to gain him to himself, to the end that
if he were to make a universal subversion in this State, Abdelcader might
furnish him with a pretext specious enough, by giving the people to understand,
that Abdalla by a testament, which always remained in Aly's hands, intended his
son should reign to his prejudice: For howsoever, Abdelcader was Mahomet's son,
as well as Abdalla; and albeit he was no very able Prince, yet had he no vices,
so that the people did not hate him. Aly considered further, that if he should
come to extreme violence, and dispossess Abdalla, that Abdelcader might reign,
he should make a King, without ceasing to be one; it being certain, that he
would have need of him for the Government of his State.

After this reasoning which Aly had within himself, and after an indifferent
long discourse which he used to Abdelcader, to prepare him for that he was
going to say to him, he gave him to understand, that Abdalla, very far from
approving the love which he bore to a Slave, would not consent to his marriage
with the greatest Prince of the Earth; because both by interest, and ^or the
better assuring of the Crown to his son (...) would have the matter go in that
sort. I leave you to judge, what effect this discourse wro^g^t in the Soul of a
man, who was at one instant deprived of the hope of ever possessing the object
of his love, and of his ambition, which are two of the most violent of all
passions.

Aly, perceiving by the trouble which appeared in Abdelcader's face, how much
he was moved; and judging by his silence that he confided not in him, seeing he
concealed his resentment, said unto him to confirm him, that he had always done
what he could to oppose such violent maxims; that he remembered he was the son
of his ancient Master; and that he assured him he would never omit any occasion
to serve him. But after many conversations on this subject, Aly seeing that the
Kings love augmented daily, and finding that his own always became stronger,
propounded at length to Abdelcader the putting him in possession, both of his
Mistress, and of the Crown of Marocco. So bold a proposition made Abdelcader
doubt, that this was rather a discourse to tempt him, and to discover his
intentions, then to serve him. But Aly made him soon change his opinion; for
having showed him Abdalla's testament, which he had in his keeping, whereby he
left the Crown of Marocco to his son, to the prejudice of Abdelcader, he no
longer doubted but that he might absolutely confide in him; so that after this
they thought of nothing but of executing their designs. Aly had for so long a
time had the whole Government of this State, as there was not an Officer in all
the Kingdom, that was not obliged to him for the Charge which he exercised: He
was very powerful of himself; all the Kings Treasures were in his hands; all
strong places depended on him; the memory of the Xerife Mahomet reigned still
amongst these people; and the violent death of Hamet was the cause that Abdalla
was not universally beloved: for the people believed that Aly had not put him
to death but by his commandment, though it was not true.

Now to carry the matter with more certainty, Aly told Abdelcader, that the
principal point was to render themselves Masters of Marocco: for by the
experience of the past Wars, and by a fatality which seemed inevitable, all
they who had seized on it had at the very same instant subjected all the rest
of the Kingdom; That to do it without danger he was to make show, at such time
as Abdelcader should enterprise the executing of the business, of being still
faithful to the King, to the end he might give him bad counsel, and seize upon
his and Mariama's person, when time should serve for it, to put them in the
same prison, where Hamet, Muley Zidan, and his children had lain. But that it
was first requisite to make it be dexterously bruted amongst the people, that
Abdalla would defraud him of the right he had to the Crown, and for that effect
would not suffer him to marry; That to render the matter more plausible, he
should in a public audience go and demand permission to marry a grandchild
of the last King of Tunis, who was in the Court of Marocco; but said Abdelcader
then to him, If she should be granted unto me, I should be extremely perplexed;
for indeed I do not desire the Crown of Marocco, but to share it with the Slave
Sophronia. Fear not that, said he unto him, for I shall be of the Council, and
I will oblige Abdalla so severely to refuse her to you, as you shall then have
a pretext specious enough to make use of the Soldiers, which I shall give you
to begin the revolt. And to let the people see Abdalla's bad faith, and to
oblige him not to doubt of me, until such time as I am sure of him, you must go
to my Palace to offer some violence there, as it were charging me with the
outrage you have received: And after you have made as though you had plundered
it, you shall show the people Abdalla's testament, which I will give you
beforehand. In the mean time be assured that I will take so good an order for
all things, as you shall meet but with few enemies to fight with; and that in a
little time I will deliver you the key of the prison, wherein I shall have shut
up Abdalla, his son, and Mariama; and after this you shall have the Crown and
Sophronia, whom you may marry if you think good; or according to our Laws treat
as a Slave, since she shall be yours: And for me, said he unto him, Hipolita is
the only recompense which I demand of you. You mistake the name, said
Abdelcader to him, and you would no doubt speak of Leonida. No, no, replied
Aly; and then he declared unto him the truth of the matter, and so they parted,
after they had well examined their enterprise again, and fully resolved not to
let a day pass, without laboring to advance the execution thereof as much as
they could.

In the mean space Abdalla li^^^ still in some hope, that he should be able to
touch the heart of Hipolita, especially since cause onspiracy of Abdelcader;
for the subtle Aly since that, to busy his mind the more ple^^ belly, had
assured him, that provided he would continue living with her, as he had done
certain days before, he despaired not to obtain of her more then he had thought
he should. The Princess Mariama on her part had imparted to Hipolita, and her
companions, the conversation which she had had with Aly; and Hipolita had also
acquainted Mariama with the declaration of love which he had made unto her,
which possessed the Princess with a great deal of unquietness. I well foresaw,
said she unto them, that Aly was not dis-interessed in this affair; but when as
she sought for means to get out of this perplexity, she could not imagine them.
She knew that the King was so strongly preoccupated with the opinion of Aly's
fidelity, that unless he learnt his crime from his own mouth, he would never
believe it. She was indeed generous enough to venture any thing for the saving
of these three maids, who craved protection of her with tears; but she feared
too, lest if she should enterprise it, and it should come to be discovered, she
might expose them to mischiefs, which would be past remedy. She resolved then
first to observe Aly with care; to talk with him oftener then she had used to
do; and if she found any likelihood of being able to hurt him, to hazard all
things for the executing of that secret hatred upon him which she had so long a
time concealed in her heart. And whereas she had much address, she courted
Abdalla more then she was accustomed to do, that she might still gain further
power over his mind for the destroying of that which Aly had gotten there. As
for us, we lived in extreme discontent; for being advertised of all the
Princess Mariama's and her fair Slaves unquietness, and foreseeing no end to so
many miseries, we led an idle and melancholic life, which was insupportable to
us all, except the Marquess, who without regarding our misfortunes, esteemed
himself the happiest man in the world, for being favorably looked upon by the
Princess Lela Mahabid.

But not to prolong my discourse with matters which are not necessary for you
to know, I shall tell you, that in four or five conversations the Princesses
address was so great, that she knew with as much certainty as strong
conjectures could give of it, that Aly had ill intentions for the Kings
children. And without being able to divine that they were in some sort to the
advantage of Abdelcader, she knew that if the King came to dye, he would not
conserve the Crown for his son. That which made Mariama more easily discover
Aly's designs was, that seeing the civility which she had showed to him some
days before, and the virtue of this Princess being more dreaded of him then all
Abdalla's authority, he had used certain obscure discourses unto her, to make
her apprehend, that if she would embrace his friendship, he would cause the
Crown of Marocco to fall upon the head of whomsoever she would. For whereas she
was the widow of Muley Zidan, to whom of right the Kingdom appertained, if they
had let him live, he thought that it may be she was capable of the desire to
remount into the Throne of her Fathers. But that being no intention of hers,
she seemed not to understand any of Aly's speeches in that manner, though
indeed she marked them very exactly. After she had thoroughly run over again in
her mind, even to the least circumstances, whatsoever might either increase or
diminish her suspicions, she resolved to advertise the King thereof. But to
prepare his mind for the entertaining of some distrust of Aly's fidelity, she
willed Hipolita to make Abdalla perceive, as often as she saw him, that she
took great care to decline his encounter, to the end she might be the more
credited, when she should assure him that Aly had offered to marry her, for the
securing of her from his violences. The Princess Mariama, who did nothing
inconsiderately, resolved for all that to tarry some time yet for the
discovering of her suspicions.

In the mean season Aly took order for all things necessary to his enterprise,
and according to the plot which he and Abdelcader had laid, one morning when as
the King of Marocco gave audience to all them which had any thing to request of
him, Abdelcader, followed by certain of his Partisans, went and besought the
King to grant him the permission to marry the grandchild of the last King of
Tunis, and to give him a portion answerable to a person of his condition; He
told him that he was not ignorant how Princes, which might pretend to the
Crown, were not their own, but the States, and for that reason he would not
dispose of himself without his leave: He added further, that the choice which
he had made could not be blamed, since it was a person of birth equal to his;
and a person whom by reason of State he was to marry, or else they should
resolve never to marry him: it being unlikely that they would bestow her on a
foreign Prince, which might make use of the right she had to the Kingdom of
Tunis, for the troubling of that of Marocco.

Abdelcader by Aly's counsel made this proposition, rather as imposing a Law,
then craving a consent; and whereas he feared nothing so much as the obtaining
of that, which he seemed to desire so earnestly, when he found that Abdalla
made no show in his countenance of being any whit troubled with this
proposition, he, notwithstanding his confidence in Aly's promise to him to
hinder it, added so many things more to those he had already delivered, as
Abdalla, after he had answered him, that the affair, whereof he spoke, was of
two great importance to be resolved on precipitously, commanded him to hold his
peace, and to withdraw. Hereupon Abdalla, who in his heart did not disapprove
of the matter, demanded counsel of Aly in private concerning it, who after he
had protested, that the sol^ ^ood of his State made him speak, represented unto
him, that in the design which he had to preserve the Crown for his son, it
imported much that Abdelcader should not be married; and less yet to the
Princess of Tunis, then to any other; because in this sort it was to give him
right a second time to his Estates, and to furn'sh him with a pretext to make
War as often as he met with an occasion for it; That to take from him the
boldness thence-forward to offer such like propositions, he was to tell him
absolutely, that this marriage did not please him, even without coloring the
matter with any apparent reasons, as he might do; because, said he,
Abdelcader's boldness could not be sufficiently punished.

Abdalla following Aly's opinion in all things, contradicted him not in this,
where he thought his interest alone was regarded. He sent Abdelcader word then,
that he forbad him to think of marrying himself, either to the Princess of
Tunis, or to any other; that he should leave to him the care of choosing a wife
for him; and that if he did otherwise, he should then be declared guilty of
High Treason. Abdelcader no sooner received this answer, but every one in
Marocco knew it, and every one murmured at it. The Princess Mariama could not
comprehend this business; for she knew that Abdelcader had testified a great
deal of love to Sophronia in diverse occasions; and knew also that he had never
regarded the Princess of Tunis but with indifferency; and that if there had not
been some hidden thing in his design, she should have been the first to whom he
would have spoken of it: but howsoever she reasoned thereupon, she could not
discover the truth. And whereas Hipolita had for some time together lived with
the King, as she had ordained her, she observed that Abdalla perceived this
change; so that seeing the matter in this estate, she went one morning to his
lodging, where she craved the favor of him to talk with him in private, and the
King having granted it to her, she besought him to promise her, that if he did
not give credit to what she was going to tell him, he at leastwise would never
speak of it again; being fully resolved not to acquaint him with that she had
to communicate unto him, unless he would engage his word unto her to do so.

The King, being touched with an extraordinary curiosity, and yet fearing that
Mariama would speak to him of his love to Hipolita, stood a while without
answering her; but at length having promised her as much as she had desired of
him, she began to prepare his mind with a very particular address. I know, said
she unto him, that for this which I am going to tell you I ought to be
suspected of you, either of malice, or of preoccupation: I know also, that Aly
being so mightily established in your affection, I shall expose my self to the
hazard of displeasing you, in telling you that I suspect he is not so faithful
unto you, as his birth and obligations to you ought to make him: I know too,
that in what manner soever you hear the business, it will be still offensive
unto you; for if you believe there is any malice in my discourse, you will no
doubt be sorry to find a stain in the Soul of a person that is so dear unto
you; and if on the contrary you find that I am not to blame, the displeasure of
having been betrayed by a man whom you have so much obliged will disquiet you;
and whether it be out of a sense of glory, or of tenderness, you will be
grieved: Judge then, my Lord, if the matter which I am to tell you be not
important, since bearing you all the respect and all the affection that I ought
to have for a Prince, who is both my King and my brother, I expose my self
notwithstanding to the hazard of troubling his rest, and getting his hatred,
which is to me my supreamest misfortune.

Abdalla, amazed with Mariama's discourse, though he did not believe that she
could tell him any thing which was true against Aly's fidelity, yet left he not
to assure her, that in case the suspicions which she said she had against Aly
proved not to be well grounded, he would judge well of her intentions, and be
always obliged unto her for her zeal and affection. After this Mariama, to stir
up some trouble in Abdalla's mind, and touch his heart where it was most
sensible, imparted unto him how Aly, forgetting the respect which he owed to
him, had been so daring as to profess love to the Slave Hipolita, who belonged
to her; but this prudent Prince did not let Abdalla know, that she understood
any thing of his affection; so that without standing longer on this discourse,
yet this is not that, said she unto him, which obliges me to speak to you of
Aly, but the design which he has, if you chance to dye before him, to break
the testament you have made him, by taking the Crown from off the head of your
son, to dispose of it according to his pleasure, or it may be to set it on his
own head.

So strange an accusation did not at first encounter with any great belief in
Abdalla's mind, thinking that the secret hate, which this Princess bore Aly,
made her judge of him in this sort for that which regarded his State; but for
that which concerned his love, though it was more unlikely then the other,
because he might conceive, that Mariama had taken his Confident for a Lover of
Hipolita, yet he believed more of it then she would have had him. And making
show of being more moved with Aly's want of respect to her, then with his own
interest, he demanded of her very exactly, how she came to perceive Aly's
passion; and whether the conjectures she had of it were strong enough? because
if it proved to be so, he meant to punish him for his boldness. My Lord, said
this Princess unto him, you do me too much favor, rather to think of me, then
of the good of your State; but to imitate your generosity, be pleased, without
considering me, to let me regard nothing but your person alone, and by some
invention let me furnish you with means, either to convince or justify Aly.
And then, without Abdalla's demanding it, she recounted all those things unto
him which had been cause of her suspicions: but at length the trouble of this
Princes mind being somewhat appeased, he believed that Aly might be his Rival,
but believed not that he had any design upon his Crown. Howbeit Mariama said so
much unto him, that in the end with her entreaties and reasons she obtained of
him, that for fifteen days space he would do whatsoever she would have him for
the clearing of the business. This Prince had much ado to resolve upon making
any doubt of Aly's fidelity, so far forth as to seek out the means of
convincing him; but at last the consideration of Mariama, and a little touch of
jealousy carried him unto it: yet was it upon condition, that if Aly were
found innocent, she should from thence-forward have as much goodness for him,
as she had had aversion.

Mariama having promised Abdalla all that he desired, she began the very same
day one of the most extraordinary Artifices, as ever was made use of, for the
discovery of the thoughts of an ambitious man and a Traitor; and lo, how she
proceeded. She obliged Abdalla to keep his chamber certain days, and not to let
himself be seen of any but his Physicians, and the Slaves which served him. At
first Aly marvelled not to see the door kept fast against all the Great ones of
the Kingdom, because he knew that it is the custom of the Kings of Marocco to
shut themselves up many times whole Months together with their wives and
Slaves, to the end that suffering not themselves to be seen so often, the
people may respect them the more: neither did he find it strange, that he
himself was not permitted to enter there, by reason Mariama, who kept her
design concealed, told him, that Abdalla was not well, and that they which
looked to him, had forbidden any body from seeing him; as indeed the Physicians
had a command from the King to say so, and to be always very frequent about
him, that it might be believed he was sic^. During this, Aly was somewhat
jealous and fearful, that this retirement proceeded rather from Abdalla's love,
then from any malady; but at length the knowledge he had of Mariama's virtue
dissipated this suspicion, and he believed, as all others did, that the King
was effectively sick. In the mean time, Abdelcader and he thought of the design
they had in hand; and they brought the business to such a pass, as it wanted
not above eight days of being in an estate to be ready to break forth, when as
Mariama began to tell Aly, that the King was in danger; that his disease became
every day worse and worse; and that if he mended not the sooner, his Physicians
were out of hope of him.

This Princess had carried the matter with such Art, as all those of the Palace
were in tears; for she had so well instructed all the persons that saw the
Prince, as with a feigned melancholy they possessed every one that spoke to
them with a true one. This false news stayed Abdelcader's designs; for Aly
represented unto him, that if the King should happen to dye, it would be a more
favorable conjuncture for them, then that wherein they were, to make the
business which they had projected, succeed; because then they should have a
lawful cause to take up Arms for the executing of the Xeriffe Mahomet's
Testament, to the prejudice of Abdalla's: That in the mean season they were not
to neglect giving order for all things; and to cause as many Soldiers, as they
could, of all the Garrisons which depended the most absolutely of Aly, to come
secretly into Marocco, to the end they might make use of them, as soon as
Abdalla should be dead, or escaped from the danger wherein they thought him to
be. Aly in this incertainty went twenty times a day to Mariama's lodging to
know how the King did; but though he was one of the most dextrous men in the
world, yet was this Princess more then he. In the beginning of this fiction she
sighed, and showed as much affliction, as if that which she said had been true;
but when it came near to the time, wherein she had resolved to finish her
design, as often as Aly saw her she composed her countenance in that manner, as
it seemed she took great care to conceal a part of her grief; and that her Soul
was more nearly touched, then she made show of. This Artifice failed not to
work that which she expected from it; for Aly, thinking he had observed, how
this Princess affected to appear more constant, then she was, believed that
Abdalla was dead; and that Mariama, for some secret design, or to seize upon
the Crown, or to conserve it for Abdalla's son, would not publish it as yet.

When as Mariama perceived Aly's thought, she advertised Abdalla, that the next
day she would either convince, or justify his favorite: And having instructed
him in that which she would have him to do, she caused a Guard to come in for
to seize on Aly, in case there should be need of it; and took order for all
things so secretly, as no body discovered any thing. The day following Aly
early in the morning came to Mariama, with an intent to employ all his address
for the clearing of the doubt wherein he was: for ambition and love gave him so
much impatience, as he had no rest. And verily in this occasion the protection
of Heaven appeared visibly, both to revenge Mariama of Aly's cruelty, and to
preserve us. For it is certain, that as the matter was carried, Abdalla and
Mariama had been lost; Sophronia had been exposed to the violences of
Abdelcader; Hipolita to the brutishness of Aly, and the rest of us to be
constrained to dye in defending them, or not to survive their loss, had not
Mariama wrought as she did.

But in fine, Aly, being come one morning, as I have told you, to the
Princesses chamber, and she having used as much address in talking with him, as
she had done at other times, augmented in such sort the opinion which he had
that Abdalla was dead, as not able to let himself be any longer guided by
prudence, he in plain terms desired the Princess to tell him whether the King
were not dead? because, said he, if it be so, it were fit that the affairs of
the Kingdom were speedily provided for. Mariama, seeing so fair a beginning to
her design, did not answer him but with a great sigh, and without saying any
thing unto him, she led him into Abdalla's chamber. Now albeit he was already
persuaded that the King was dead, yet left he not to be mightily surprised to
see all this chamber hung with black Velvet, all the windows shut, in the midst
a great bed of State environed with a balustrate of Ebony, set all about with
flaming Torches, and upon Cushions near to the Bed, the Mantle Royal, the
Scepter, the Crown, and the Turbant of Abdalla, with his Scymitar at the feet
of the Bed, whereupon was a large black Cloth trailing a great way on the
ground, which seemed to cover the body of the King; some of his Wives and
Slaves were about the Balustrade, who testified by their countenance so
sensible a sorrow, as would have drawn tears from any other but Aly. The
Princess having conducted him then into this chamber of mourning, and
perceiving that this sad object had sufficiently persuaded him that which she
desired he should believe, she began to show an extreme affliction, and to
request him with feigned tears, that he would perform the Kings last Will, in
conserving the Crown for his son, according to the Testament he had made,
whereof he had the custody, though it was contrary to the Xeriffe Mahomet's
intention. And then, said she unto him, he has commanded me to restore the
Slave Hipolita, and her fellows, to their liberty; in regard it had seemed unto
him that he had violated the Law of Nations in retaining persons in slavery,
who by Tempest had been driven into Marocco. But, continued she, generous Aly,
this last thing imports not much; nor have I told it you, but that I would not
fail in any thing which my King, my brother, and my Lord, has given me in
charge at his death. For so much as regards the Prince his son, perform what
you have promised him, and what you ought to do.

If Abdalla, answered Aly insolently, would have me conserve the Crown for his
son, he should have lived a longer time; for it shall never be reproached unto
me, that I have placed an Infant on the Throne of Marocco. The same Testament,
added he, which gave the Crown to Abdalla, shall set it on the head of some
other; for in conclusiion, it is for men to govern children, and not for
children to govern men, no more then for women to give Councels of State. And,
continued he, for the Slave Hipolita, he that shall be King shall dispose of
her; and until then, whereas the Charge which I hold gives me absolute power
over the State, whenever an interraign happens, remit her presently into my
hands, to the end that ceasing to be a Slave, I may at leastwise perform
Abdalla's will, in breaking off her chains.

Ah, vile Traitor! cried Abdalla, in coming out from under that Cloth of black
Velvet, under which he was hidden; thy persideousness must be punished with my
hand; saying so, Abdalla laid hold on his Scymitar, and all the Guard, which
lay concealed for that effect, rushing into the chamber, Aly was so surprised,
and so confounded, as he knew not at first whether it were an apparition, or
whether eff^ctively this Prince, whom he had believed to be dead, was living.
In so great a trouble Abdalla without doubt had killed him, if the Princess
Mariama, who would not have him dye by so illustrious an hand, had not hindered
him; which was the cause, that Aly, being come to himself again, and freeing
himself from the Guard which would have seized upon him, opened a window when
as they were not aware of it, and whereas all the houses of that Country, as
they are here, are exceeding low, he leaped into the Courtyard, and was so
fortunate as he did not hurt himself, but got shi^r away out of the Palace;
leaving Abdalla so amazed and afflicted at his perfidiousness, and Mariama so
satified with the happy success of her design, that if the displeasure of
seeing Aly escaped had not moderated her joy, it would have been too violent.

Abdalla instantly commanded him to be pursued with all speed, and alive or
dead to be brought unto him: But Aly was already gotten into a man's house,
whose life before times he had saved. For in what disorder soever his soul was,
yet had he judgment enough not to go to his own home; imagining rightly that he
would be sought for there. In the mean time, the fear he had lest the King
should cause the gates of the City to be shut, made him seek out all kind of
inventions to escape. For albeit the plot which he had laid with Abdelcader was
ready to be executed, yet wanted it so much time, as he durst not enterprise
it, especially out of the thought he had, that they would not have made use of
so extraordinary an invention to discover his intentions, without having taken
order for all things. He sent word then secretly to Abdelcader, that he should
attempt nothing until he was in one of the places of their intelligence, to the
end they might be assured of a retreat, if their affairs should go ill. After
that, he disguised himself like a woman; for whereas they are all veiled in
that Country, he believed that getting speedily out of the City, before any
exact order was given at the gates, it would be easy for him to save himself,
as indeed it fell out. He that served him in this occasion promised to bring
him an horse to a place, which was not above a mile from the Town; and then
Aly, being disguised in the manner that I have related, went out of Marocco a
very little before the Guards had been placed at the Gates, with a Command to
suffer no body to pass out upon any pretext whatsoever. In the mean space
Abdalla had sent to search for Aly in his Palace, and afterward caused it to be
proclaimed over all the City, that whosoever could bring Aly unto him should
have a recompense able to enrich him for all his life.

The people, no sooner understood that Aly was in disgrace, but falling into an
uproar, and manifesting their secret hatred unto him, plundered his Palace; and
this wretched man had not a friend, who for his own security did not at
leastwise seem to be otherwise. But whereas the people are inconstant in their
resolutions, after they had committed an hundred outrages, there ran a bruit
amongst this multitude, that Abdalla was dead; and that the proclamation which
had been made was an artifice of Aly, who meant to discover by this fiction,
whether he were beloved, or hated. And whereas all extraordinary novelties
easily find credit with the people, they believed this same; and carried by
despair for that they had used too much precipitation, they went to the Court
in Arms for to see Abdalla; who, not knowing whether these which used this
violence were Aly's partakers or no, durst not go forth to show himself to
them; not having scarce any body with him, because he had sent all them of his
ordinary Guard in search of Aly. The people in the mean while not seeing
Abdalla appear, were confirmed in their opinion, and augmenting their despair
and fury they attempted to force the Palace; and they had already broken up the
first gate, when as Abdalla, causing himself to be armed, and we being placed
about him, appeased this storm with his presence, and by his speech assured the
people that Aly had incurred his indignation.

In the mean time the man, who had promised to bring him an horse, found
himself to be very much perplexed for the keeping of his word with him; for
when as he presented himself to get forth, upon pretext of some business that
he had in the Country, the Guards were already set, and having been at all the
gates in vain, yet would he not give over so, but thought that another might be
more fortunate then he; wherefore he confided in one of Aly's friends, who
taking the same horse which the other had made use of before, he went to one of
the gates to get forth, but he had the like success as the former; who, willing
to hazard all for Aly, sent a third person thither: which was the cause, that
one of the Guard, who had more brain then the rest, perceived, that although
three several men had presented themselves for to go out of the City, yet it
had been still with one and the same horse; so that he certainly b^li^ved there
was some mystery in this adventure, and how it might w^ll be that Aly was not
far off. This Soldier having imparted his thought to him that commanded the
gate, he conceived that his opinion was not ill grounded; wherefore, to clear
himself therein, he made show of being persuaded by the entreaties of this man
who d^sired to be let forth; but whilst to gain time he made yet some new
difficulties, he sent for three horses, to the end he might follow him a far
off with two of his companions; which were no sooner come, but having let him
go out, and set them elves to follow him, they saw that contrary to the custom
of all such as fear ^o be followed, he went on still without turning his head
to the place from whence h^ parted, so great a desire he had to arrive where
the unhappy Aly waited for him. S^eing then that they might follow him without
his being aware of it, they approached nearer to him, then they would have done
if he had behaved himself otherwise, and quitting the highway as well as he,
when they came near to a wood, whither this man seem^d to have a purpose to go,
they espied a woman, who having discovered them, hid her self in the thickest
of the bushes. This action made him, that was carrying the horse to Aly, turn
about his head; who knowing that he was followed, would have taken more on the
left hand, and not have gone to the place where he was attended; but this trick
would not serve his turn: howsoever it was not because those which had observed
her b^li^ved that this woman was effectively Aly, but being near unto it, they
would needs know certainly what this adventure was. The Captain then, having
given order to the two Soldiers to seize on this man, went to the place where
he had seen the woman hide her self, and had not gone fifty paces but he found
her at the foot of a tree; where, keeping down her vail still about her, she
besought him, in counterfeiting her voice, not to do her any violence. And when
she saw that this man had no intent to use her civilly, and seemed fully
resolved to discover what she was, she would have tempted this Captain with the
hope of a great recompense; so that suddenly lifting up her vail, Thou see,
said she, the unfortunate Aly, who can make thee happy if thou be wise; for
if thou will resolve to let me escape, I will put thee in a condition that thou
shall never need to ask any thing more of Fortune. This Captain, who was
faithful, or it may be did not believe that Aly in the case he was in could
recompense him as much as he said, answered him, that he would never enrich
himself by a Treason, and without further delay he called his companions, who,
having tied the man, on whom they had seized, to a tree, went to help him to
take the miserable Aly, who, though without Arms, left not off resisting them
for while. But at last they brought him to Marocco, and having conducted him
before Abdalla, this Prince reviled him with all imaginable reproaches, And
whereas Aly had always been happy, this one blow of unhappiness so mightily
surprised him, as that judgment and prudence, which had rendered him so
considerable in his prosperity, wholly abandoned him in his misfortune: so that
in stead of seeking to color his fault, he confessed it as it was, and related
unto Abdalla all that he had said and thought, just in the same manner as I
have delivered it unto you, for the Prince^s Mariama had the goodness to
recount it unto us afterward; in so much as Abdalla regarding Aly, not only
as a Traitor, but as his Rival, the tenderness which he had at other times had
for him, was of no power to excite any thought of pity in his heart; but
contrarily the remembrance of the good will he had born him incensed his mind
the more. At last, love, anger, interest of State, and jealousy, made the King
without further delay, as soon as Abdelcader was app ehended, even the very
same day take off the ambitious Aly's head, who seeing his loss inevitable
resolved for it with constancy enough. Thus was the Princess Mariama revenged
on this man for his cruelty, and Hipolita delivered from one of her
persecutors. Aly was no sooner dead, but the Princess Mariama, always generous,
went and cast her self at the Kings feet, to beg Abdelcader's life of him,
which he granted to her tears, upon condition that he should remain for some
time a prisoner: For alb^it he was guilty of high Treason, as well as Aly, for
intending to usurp the Kingdom during his life, yet was there this difference,
that Abdelcader was Abdalla's Brother, and was not his Rival.

But, Madam, to make an end of telling you at once, both the goodness of
Mariama, and our fortune, you shall understand, that in the confusion wherein
all the City of Marocco was this day, when as the Princess Mariama entered into
a Chamber where these three fair Slaves were, and saw them all in tears,
especially Hipolita, who knew well that she was in part cause of all this
disorder: this Princess, I say, seeing them in this estate, had so much
generosity, though she loved them very tenderly, as to deprive her self for
ever of them: It may be also, that the design of taking from the King an object
of passion, which might trouble his rest; from Abdelcader that which had made
him fail in this duty; and from the Princess Lela Mahabid another, which might
make her in some sort forget the rank which she held, carried her to this
resolution. But in conclusion, a little interest, and a great deal of
generosity, made her tell them, that profit was to be made of others
misfortune: so that before the King had leisure to ask for them, she caused
them to be secretly conveyed to the house of a man, who absolutely depended on
her; and having advertised us to repair thither, we continued concealed there
above eight days. She in like sort caused the Mariners and Soldiers, which we
had brought to Marocco, to be delivered; for the ambitious Aly being dead, the
Princess Mariama was as powerful in the State as the King himself.

The day following, Abdalla, seeing the Princess Mariama with a feigned
melancholy in her face, which yet he believed to be true, demanded of her,
whether revenge, which is said to be one of the greatest pleasures of Kings,
did not give her some? My Lord, said she unto him, present misfortunes are
doubtless more sensible then past pleasures; the loss of the Slaves which you
gave me, is cause of more grief to me, then that of Aly has made me feel joy.
So strange a discourse surprised the King extremely; and whereas he desired to
be cleared therein, the Princess Mariama told him, that in the confusion
wherein all things were the day before, whether Aly had caused them to be
carried away by force, or whether we had contributed any thing thereunto, so it
was, that returning in the Evening to her lodging, she had not found them
there, neither could she possibly learn any news of them. I will not repeat
unto you all that Abdalla said in this occasion, although the Princess Mariama
acquainted us with it: But in conclusion, it suffices you should know, that
Abdalla took this adventure as an amorous Prince would do; and after he had
caused search to be made over all the City, except in the place where we were,
which by the care of the Princess was exempted, she had the goodness to come
secretly and bid her dear Slaves farewell, to whom also she gave very rich
gifts: And the night following, having disposed of all things for our
departure, she caused us to be imbarqued in a Merchants Vessel, that set sail
the same night; and whereof the Captain, who was of Palermo, undertook to carry
us whithersoever we would go, in consideration of an excessive sum of money
which she gave him for that purpose.

Now, Madam, before I leave Marocco, I am to tell you, that the Marquis was not
so glad of the liberty which we hoped to enjoy, as for that he should no longer
be exposed to the hazard of being constant. I should have dyed, said he unto
us, had I not escaped from so great a danger; for if I had tarryed longer at
Marocco, I was in jeopardy of changing my humor, in not changing my Mistress:
But in the end, Madam, we had no great leisure to laugh at the Marquis his
agreeable humor, for we had not made two days sail, when as we encountered a
Vessel, by the Turks called a Carmossal, which having set upon ours, that was
but ill provided of things necessary for war, became Master of it,
notwithstanding any resistance we could make; and the Turks, which commanded
this Vessel, took us, and brought us to be sold here at Constantinople, where
our destiny has been such as you have understood.

Isabella thanked Doria for the pains he had taken in recounting this History
unto her. As for me, said Hipolita, I am not contented with my Brother, for
methinks he stood a little too much in examining that which he calls
fantasticalness in my humor. It is not for that you complain, answered Horatio
smiling, but rather because you apprehend, that we do not judge of the greatness
of your affection but by that of your jealousy. For my part, said the Marquis,
I do not complain of Doria; and I have taken more delight in hearing him relate
my love, then I took in it when I was in Marocco. And for so much as regards
me, added Leonida, I am the least satisfied with his relation, seeing I served
but for a pretext to Aly's love. Let us not jest so soon, said Sophronia
interrupting her, for in fine we are still at Constantinople. You have Reason,
answered Isabella sighing, and would it might please Heaven, that I could as
readily procure your departure from thence, and mine own with you, as I can
assure you that you are in safety there; but we must hope, continued she,
re-assuming a more quiet countenance, that the return of Justiniano will cause
ours soon after. Sophronia's humor, being very serious, and consequently more
agreeing, then the rest, with Isabella's melancholy, begot a particular
conversation with her. The Marquis approached to Emilia, and intermixing his
discourse with Hipolita's, Horatio's, Leonida's, Alphonso's, and Doria's, they
entertain^d one another, as persons whom the hope of a future good had made to
forget all the evils past. But at length night coming on, and Isabella
rememb'ring the counsel which the Sultana Asteria had given her, not to incense
the mind of Soliman, she took leave of this dear Troop, and returned to the
old Serraglio; where Asteria had been in much impatience for her return,
fearing lest the Sultan her Father should be displeased, if she did not observe
the order he had given.

The End of the First Book.
The Second Book.
ROxelana in the mean time was not without unquietness, in knowing by her
Spies, that Soliman's friendship to Ibrahim, and the respect which he had to
Isabella, had kept him until then from discovering his love plainly to her that
caused it. For whereas ambition was the only thing that reigned in her heart,
she might well be jealous of the power of Ibrahim, but not of the beauty of
Isabella. She knew that the grand Vizier would never give her the means to
ruin him, nor do any thing against the service of the Grand Signior, were he
not constrained thereunto by some very sensible outrage. She knew also, that
Soliman would never disoblige Ibrahim if some mighty passion did not force him
to it. In fine, the love to Isabella was that, which begat a hope in her heart
of destroying a man, whom she did not hate, but because he was too generous,
and that she would reign alone. And whereas she saw that if Isabella went every
day out of the Serraglio, it might come to pass that Soliman seeing her but
seldom might peradventure change his mind, she resolved, for the preventing
thereof, to complain of the liberty she had, and to let the Sultan understand,
how the Muphti had advertised her, that the people began already to murmur at
it. There needed no further matter to oblige Soliman to a thing, which he
desired far more then she. But whereas the fear of displeasing Isabella was so
much the greater, as his love was the stronger, he could not resolve, not only
to forbid her from going forth, but to see her that day wherein she should
receive this order; neither knew he what person to choose that might deliver
this rude message unto her: At last upon good advisement he sent for the
Sultana Asteria, whom he enjoined, after he had extremely caressed her, so to
order the matter, that Isabella might go but very seldom out of the Serraglio.

My Lord, said Asteria unto him, has thy Highness forgot what thou said to
her yesterday with thine own mouth? No, said the Grand Signior unto her, and
therefore it is why I will not make a prohibition which contravenes the
civilities I have used to her, but I would willingly, that by thy counsel and
address, without any show of my constraining her, she should be carried of her
self to do that which I desire; for the Sultana Queen complains of the liberty
which I give her, the people murmur at it, all the Sultanaes take it ill, and
hate her for it.

My Lord, answered Asteria, after that which thy Highness has said to
Isabella, I doubt that my counsel and speeches will be suspected of her; and
that she will give more credit to thy words, then to all that I can say to her.
I perceive well, said Soliman then to her, that thou love not to carry
displeasing news; but howsoever it concerns thee to please and obey me. I do
not refuse either the one or the other, replied the Sultana with a great deal
of submission, but if I might be permitted to say what I think, I would beseech
thy Highness to consider if there be not a kind of rigor in keeping Isabella
from visiting the only persons which are dear to her ^n Constantinople; and by
a constraint, whereunto she is not accustomed, to make the place of her refuge
become her prison. In truth, my Lord, continued she, the virtue of this
Princess, and the services of Ibrahim, should deserve methinks, that our
Customs should not be so much considered as their Interests. Soliman, not being
able to answer the Sultana Asteria, grew angry with her; you have your Reasons,
said he unto her, and I have mine; but if I had none, I would not for all that
but be obeyed: Go then, and do what I command you, for otherwise you alone
shall be responsable to me for Isabella's actions. Asteria seeing so much anger
in Soliman's eyes, no longer doubted but that this passion was occasioned by
another, so that fearing to hurt Isabella in thinking to serve her, she
besought the Sultan to pardon her, and went away, after she had promised him to
perform his pleasure.

The Sultana Asteria, being extremely afflicted for the commission she had
received, went to Isabella's lodging, who seeing her enter with an
extraordinary melancholy; Is it in your person, or in mine, said she unto her,
that I am unhappy? I could wish, answered Asteria embracing her, that you were
in a condition of having no other grief, but that of the compassion which
others miseries might give you, but Fortune will not treat you so favorably.
Isabella suddenly blushed, and according to the custom of those that love well,
she presently thought of that which was most dear to her, and imagined that
some misfortune was befallen the grand Vizier; so that beholding Asteria with
an extraordinary attention, Is there, said she unto her, any unlucky accident
happened unto Ibrahim? has he been beaten? is he dead, or a prisoner? No,
answered Asteria, there is not any of that arrived; and that which I am to tell
you, is indeed enough to make you murmur, but not enough to possess you with
any extreme grief; and if you discern any melancholy in my face, it is rather a
mark of the part which I take in all that concerns you, then of the greatness
of your misfortune. And then Asteria, not to hold her longer in pain, recounted
unto her all the conversation which she had had with Soliman, and thereupon
advised her to comply so far with him. For truly, said she unto her, either the
Sultan does love you, or he does not; if he does not, and that he desires you
should abide here, to satisfy Roxelana, and the custom, you are not to oppose
his pleasure: and contrarily, if it be true, that he is in passion for you, the
l^ss occasion you shall give him to be carried to some violence, will be the
most advantageous and sure. A Lover in choler (as I conceive) is more to be
feared then another; for whereas choler does most commonly banish away respect
from the Souls of those whom it possesses, one must forbear as long as is
possible from exposing ones self to the hazard of angering an amorous Prince,
who being able to do whatsoever he will, is always in an estate to be feared.
You have reason, generous Asteria, said Isabella unto her, but what will my
friends say, when they shall see that I do not visit them any more, and that I
abandon them? Will they not have cause to think, that the magnificences of the
Serraglio have blinded me? and it may be something yet worse. No, no, said
Asteria, for we will cause them to be advertised of the truth of the matter, or
at leastwise of the pretext which they have made use of to retain you here.
But, added Isabella, what end can I foresee of my misery? The return of
Ibrahim, replied Asteria, will make it cease; and he shall no sooner be at
Constantinople, but the Sultan will no longer have other then just desires, and
you shall recover your liberty. After that these two virtuous persons had
entertained themselves a while, they parted; Asteria promising Isabella, if she
would write to her Friends, to see her Letter conveyed unto them the next
morning, as indeed she failed not to do.

This news strangely surprised all this fair Troop; but whereas the pretext,
whereof Soliman made use, was not without probability, and that Isabella by her
Letter had rendered it more likely unto them, to the end she might keep them
from conceiving any thing to her disadvantage, they believed it to be as it was
represented unto them, without seeking for any other explication thereof;
comforting themselves in some sort with the hope which Isabella gave them of
visiting them sometimes: For to make their separation the easier, though she
could not hear from Ibrahim as yet, she left not for all that to assure them
that he would be back in a little space; and so consequ^ntly they should ere
long be in an estate of going to see their Country again.

This hope failed not to work the effect which Isabella expected from it; all
this company was more jovial and more sociable, and whereas Ibrahim's Palace
was wonderful fair, and that they were served thereby the Grand Signior's order
exceeding magnificently, their exile no doubt was supportable enough; sometimes
they walked in the Garden; sometimes they romed up and down in the Grot, or sat
in the shade of the Grove of Orange Trees, which was hard by; other whiles they
bestowed their time in the Gallery of the Turkish Emperors; and many times also
in the Library, where they met with that which diverted their sorrow, or
contented their curiosity. But one day when as they met all together in
Ibrahim's Cabinet, after they had called to mind all their mishaps, and had
admired by what adventure Fortune had conducted them into a place, where they
had encountered Isabella, passing insensibly from one discourse to another, they
bethought them that they had not been yet acquainted with that which had
arrived to the Marquess. Whereupon Leonida demanded of him why he had not
related it unto them? You have showed your selves so little curious of it,
replied he, that I am resolved not to give you this satisfaction without some
recompense. You have too noble a Soul, said Leonida to him smiling, to be
mercenary; and then again, what can you ask of exiled persons, and such too as
do not enjoy their liberty? To put you yet into more pain, replied the
Marquess, I must tell you, that you alone can pay me in that manner as I
desire; and it is you alone that can oblige me to recount my last adventures.
If you do not explain your self better, answered Leonida, we shall not make up
our match; but whereas the entertainment of the company is exceeding dear to
me, tell me, what recompense do you demand? I desire, said he unto her, that
before I relate that unto you which befell me, you will let us know what
discontent that was which made you quit Genoua to go to Albengua; what moved
you to marry a man whom you did not love, and banish one whom you did not hate:
For to speak freely unto you, it has been imparted unto me at Genoua in such a
manner, as gives me a great deal of curiosity, and makes me desire to know
whether I have been told the truth or no. As for me, said Hipolita, I have
intended a long time since to entreat Leonida she would acquaint me with it;
but Fortune has so cruelly persecuted us, as we have scarce had any leisure
but to feel new miseries, without remembering those which were already past.
Certainly, added Doria, it I durst join my entreaties to those of the Company,
I would request Leonida to grant us this favor. For my part, said Sophronia, I
have not the same curiosity, for I am so fully informed of this History, as I
do not know any thing that has happened to my self better. If the company, said
Leonida to her, will needs know it, I shall make advantage of it if you will
take the pains to relate it unto them; for as for me, I am fully resolved not
to expose my self a second time to the vexation which this relation has been
the cause of to me. Do not reproach my old error unto me, said Alphonso
interrupting her; and to deliver you from this unquietness, and for fear lest I
should find my self too weak to hear a thing without grief which has given me
so much, I will go and walk in the Garden, or entertain my self with a Book.

Alphonso, after he had said this, went without attending Leonida's answer
forth of the Cabinet, and would not return thither again, though the Marquess
called him more then once. His absence did not for all that change Leonida's
opinion, and whatsoever could be said unto her, she would not recount her own
History; but she requested Sophronia to take the trouble of it upon her. This
fair maid, seeing that the whole company desired this complacency of her,
resolved to satisfy them, after she had prayed Leonida, that if she forgot any
thing she would put her in mind of it; and Leonida, having promised her to do
so, she then made the Marquess to swear, that as soon as ever she had finished
her relation, he should begin his: And when as he had assured her that he would
not fail therein, and had told her that he had at leastwise as much desire to
recount his adventures unto her, as she had to know them, Sophroni^ began, and
spoke in this sort.

The History of LEONIDA.
THe Adventures of Leonida have something so extraordinary in them, as they are
to be related in somewhat a particular manner; for to render the recital of
them the more agreeable and intelligible unto you, I am not to say any thing to
you yet of the beginning of her life, of her first Conquests, nor of her
marriage, but only acquaint you with Alphonso's love, which I believe took its
beginning presently upon Justiniano's return, and a year and half after the
death of Leonida's husband. This Conquest without doubt was not disagreeable
unto her; for, as you know, Alphonso has merit, wisdom, and wit; and if after
these, which certainly are the greatest and most essential good things, it is
fit to consider the rest, you are not ignorant that Alphonso is rich enough,
and of a race illustrious enough to touch a heart on the side of interest and
glory, as well as of affection. In fine, whether Leonida were capable of love
or ambition, she found in the person of Alphonso, wherewith to beget these two
passions in her heart, and wherewith to render them excusable. If Leonida were
not present, I would tell you, that whereas she has a great deal of wit, Love
in this encounter was introduced into her Soul rather by Reason, then by sense
and inclination.

But not to stand upon small things, you shall understand that Alphonso, who
you have always seen so assidual in serving her, after he had rendered her all
the testimonies of love, that a worthy person can desire of a man infinitely
passionate, he knew at length from her own mouth, that his vows were not
rejected, and that he was not forbidden to hope. After the day that she had
permitted him to entertain her openly with his passion, it is certain that
Leonida had continually all the complacency for him, which a virtuous woman was
capabl^ of. And whereas you know that Leonida has naturally a gallant wit, and
a very ^ovial humor, sh oftentimes gave him the pleasure to hear her jeer his
Rivals in his presence, and an hundred times made her Conquests serve for his
glory. Alphonso then lived in this sort with more content, then the extreme
love which he bore her seemed to permit; for, as I have heard it said, this
passion seldom leaves any great tranquillity in the Souls of those whom it
possesses.

But for Alphonso, he was the most generous Lover that ever was; his
inclination had not been blind; all the world approved of his choice; he loved
an amiable person, and was beloved of her; she took care not to give him any
cause of jealousy; his very Rivals served for his delight and felicity by the
usage that she gave them; his father did not contradict his affection; Leonida
was of a free condition, and might dispose of her self; yea and to keep him
from being deprived of the pleasure of hoping for the possession of a person
that could render him contented, Leonida, to assure her self yet further of his
love, would not so much as let him make use of his friends for the motioning of
their marriage. In so happy an estate methinks it is hard to imagine what could
trouble his felicity, especially when I shall have told you, that Leonida used
him still as favorably as before, and without any change arriving in her, yet
there arrived a change in him. I well perceive, continued Sophronia, after she
had been a while without speaking, that you cannot divine what it was which
troubled Alphonso's happiness; and certainly I cannot think it strange, seeing
according to my sense this adventure is so extraordinary, as it is impossible
to conjecture it. You shall understand then, that one day Alphonso being gone
to see a kinsman of his, whereas the person beloved is a part of all
conversations, and a man infinitely amorous speaks without choice and judgment
of his Mistress to every one, he came to speak of Leonida to his kinsman,
though to say truth he was not worthy of that honor; for this man is both
malicious and blockish; According then to his humor and stupidity he rudely
asked of Alphonso, whether he believed that he had been the first which ever
had been affected of Leonida?

Now whereas Alphonso had been a long time in the voyage, from whence
Justiniano brought him back, he had understood nothing of what had happened to
Leonida, for being fallen in love with her presently after his return, no body
had been so uncivil as to say any such thing to him. It was not, as you shall
know by the sequel of this History, because that which arrived unto Leonida was
not glorious for her; but because love is a passion that renders the spirit so
sensible and delicate, as it is impossible to hear that the person whom one
loves, should have affection for another, without some sense of gri^f. And
verily Alphonso tried it but too well in this occasion; he believed at first
notwithstanding, that this was an effect of the malice of his kinsman, who
regarding his succession, had perchance a design to do what he could for the
rendering Leonida less amiable: but when as continuing his incivility he had
told him, that one, named Octavio, of the House of the Pallavicins, and who was
dead since, had in times past loved her, and that he had been infinitely loved
of her, he did not believe that this man durst have told him things so
precisely, if they had not been true.

At length Alphonso, having made his visit, retired with some unquietness;
nevertheless, whereas he had not yet lost his Reason, he did not find that he
had any cause to complain of Leonida, for that she had been loved of Octavio,
or for that she had loved him in a time when as he was not known to her. For,
said he, I should be unjust to desire, that the eyes of Leonida should not have
begun to make Conquests before they captivated me; and I should be unreasonable
to desire also that she should have been absolutely insensible of the affection
of a man, who it may be was of more worth then my self. Now whereas Love is
ingenious to torment those which are under his Empire, Alphonso did not
complain of having a Rival, that had not been hated, but for that Leonida had
made a secret of it to him: This unquietness was not for all that very strong,
but you shall understand by the sequel of my discourse, that it carried him to
another, which put him to a great deal of pain.

Alphonso had no sooner the commodity to speak with Leonida in private, but
making show as if it were without design he took occasion to name Octavio; this
name, which had been so dear to Leonida, could not be heard of her without
touching her heart; and her heart could not be moved, without giving some marks
of it in her face: For her Sense preventing her Reason, she blushed and ^^^hed
both at an instant; howbeit desiring to conceal this disorder from Alphonso,
she laid her hand over her eyes, and endeavoring to change discourse, he was
thereby persuaded, that this touched her heart exceeding sensibly; augmented
his curiosity; and made him resolve to testify it to her plainly.

In pursuance of so precipitous a design, Alphonso, without deferring the
execution of it any further, said unto her, I would fain, fair Leonida, be
assured, that after my being dead for your service, my name should be so happy
as to make you blush and sigh, as the blessed Octavio's has done. You should
do better, answered Leonida sighing a second time, to call him unfortunate
Octavio. Whosoever has been loved of you, replied Alphonso, could never be
unhappy, notwithstanding any thing that could arrive to him otherwise. I wish
for all that, said Leonida, that you never make trial of the like felicity:
But, continued she with an altered countenance, why have you spoken to me of
Octavio? Let us leave him to enjoy that rest which he could never find in this
life; let us not trouble ours in troubling his; and let us, I pray you, have so
much regard to him, as to leave his ashes in peace. Please you to pardon me,
said Alphonso then unto her, if without losing the respect which I owe to you,
I dare crave of you, for a mark of your affection, that you will take the pains
to relate exactly unto me, that which Octavio in times past bore unto you, that
which you bore to him and briefly all that besell you till the time of his
death; otherwise you will give me caus^ to complain of you. Leonida would not
at first accord to Alphonso that which he desired of her; for as she knew how
highly her heart had been touched for Octavio, so she know likewise that it
would be impossible for her to remember all their felicities, and all their
misfortunes, without a great deal of unquietness; wherefore she excused her
self from it as much as she could; nevertheless seeing that Alphonso took this
refusal for a wrong, she promised to grant him his desire, so as he would give
her some time; and in this sort many days past away, Alphonso being unable to
make her keep her word with him, But at length, his curiosity being grown the
stronger by Leonida's resistance, he testified unto her one day so seriously,
that he should hold himself disobliged by her, if she continued in the
resolution which she seemed to have, as having appointed him a time to come to
her for that purpose, she resolved to content him. If one had then demanded of
Alphonso why his curiosity was so strong, he could not have told, at leastwise
he has acknowledged so much to Leonida since: For whereas he was persuaded
that she had loved Octavio, both by that which his Kinsman had told him, by
that which he had also learned other-where concerning it, and by the marks
which he had seen of it in her countenance, if in her speech nevertheless she
had disguised the truth, that lying would have given him a great deal of
unquietn^ss; and yet he felt in his heart, that if contrarily she should avouch
unto him, that she had loved him very much, this discourse would not please
him. But at last, carried by a secret motion, which he could not resist, he
went with an extreme impatience to the assignation which Leonida had given him.
He found her more sad then ordinary; for whereas her imagination was filled
with displeasing idea's, that charming and jovial air, which she has usu^lly
in her face, was somewhat changed. After she had caused Alphonso to sit down,
and had told him, that she was going to render him the greatest proof of her
affection that he had ever yet received, she was ready to impart unto him what
her fortune had been, when as Alphonso, before he would give her leisure so to
do, conjured her once again not to omit any part of all that which had arrived
unto her. But he had no need to entreat her thereunto, for Leonida had no
sooner began to speak, but forgetting that she was recounting her History to
her Lover, she suffered herself to be charmed with her own relation; and
showing grief or joy, according as the matters which she related gave her
occasion for, she omitted not any thing of all that happened unto her. She
imparted to him, that Octavio's house being near to hers, she had no soone^
opened her eyes, but she was acquainted with him; and that he had no sooner
beheld her in his tendrest infoncy, but he was pleased with her. That their
Fathers being friends, they had a thousand times seen one another in that
innocent age, wherein decency did not require one yet to live with so great a
restraint; and that then, without knowing what it was to love, they sorbore not
carrying affection to each other. She told him further, that in this age,
wherein feigning and dissimulation have no part, and wherein the inclinations
of the Soul appear such as they are, so great a correspondence was seen betwixt
Octavio's, and hers, as no difference could be found therein. But, said she to
Alphonso sighing, neither he nor I knew, that this sympathy, which so straightly
united our hearts and minds, should disunite us eternally; that this springing
love should one day be the cause of his death, and cost me so many tears; and
without dreaming of any such thing, the pleasure alone of seeing one another
and talking together, took up all our Souls. We knew not as yet for all that,
added she, what those thoughts were which we had one for the other; neither did
we perceive them, till decency would not permit us to see one another so often.
The privation of a good makes us know the greatness of it, and the design which
we had to conceal our affection began to make me suspect th^^ there was
something in it more then good will: I did then all that I could to disengage
my mind from a passion, which I had always heard to be very dangerous; but
whereas it was more ancient in me then Reason, Reason was not strong enough to
chase it out of my Soul; but contrarily it was she which engaged me further in
it, and that speaking to me of Octavio, drew the picture of the worthiest man
that ever was. She told him moreover that, which she felt in her heart, when as
by any reason of honor, or business, he was constrained to be absent from
Genoua; the small delight she took in Assemblies when he was not there; and how
much she enforced her self to seem merry during his absence. She acquainted him
also, how exact Octavio was in following her pleasure in all things; what care
he used to take from her all occasion of suspecting his fidelity; and with what
discretion he still demeaned himself toward her all the time of his serving
her.

But, said Alphonso interrupting her, had you never any of those petty
disorders, which augment love, rather then diminish it? No, no, answered
Leonida, Octavio never gave me cause to complain; besides, our affection had no
need of that artifice to render it the stronger; since it is certain that never
any person loved more perfectly then we. Alphonso would fain have assured
Leonida, that he loved her yet better then Octavio had loved her, but his mind
was so unquiet, as he could scarce speak. And then again, Leonida gave him not
leisure to do it; for she was so attentive in exactly relating all that had
past betwixt Octavio and her, as she never took heed of all the several changes
which her discourse made in his face. She continued then telling him, that
after an indifferent long love, Octavio, having obtained permission of her to
demand her of her parents, believed that his happiness was so sure, as he had
no doubt at all of it; for whereas his Father and hers had always lived as good
friends together, and their fortunes were equal, he could foresee no impediment
in it. But he knew not, said Leonida then looking on Alphonso, that a passion
less noble then that which reigned in his heart opposed his; and that avarice,
which is far more powerful in the minds of old men, then love is in that of
young folks, should destroy his and my hopes, and should finish our love by his
death, for to settle a grief in my soul, which I shall conserve there eternally.

In sequel hereof, Leonida likewise declared to Alphonso, that one named Livio,
of the Family of the Frigozes, a man very rich in the goods of fortune, but
very poor in those of the mind, being touched with her beauty, without any
thought of discovering his affection to her, or gaining her favor, went the
very same day that he fell in love with her, and demanded her of her Father:
prescribing him no other conditions, then that of giving him his daughter; and
that this old man, who knew Livio's wealth, being more mightily touched with
the love of riches, then Livio was with the beauty of Leonida, had promised him
to bestowed her on him, and had engaged his word to him in such sort, as
nothing was able to make him break it. So that Octavio arriving an hour after
that Livio was gone, and making his proposition, he was wonderfully surprised
to learn from Leonida's Father, that he had promised his daughtar, and that it
would be in vain for him to hope he might make him change his resolution.
Octavio could not apprehend, that Leonida could be promised to any one, and she
not know of it; and on the other side, said Leonida to Alphonso, my fidelity
was so well known to him, as he durst not doubt of it. In so deplorable an
estate, continued she, he left my Father, and came and found me out at an Aunts
of mine, who favored our affection, and where I had appointed him to come and
acquaint me with the answer he should receive. But O Heaven I cried she, I did
not foresee that this sentence should be that of Octavio's death, and of the
loss of all the felicity that I attended from it. He came then, but with so
much melancholy in his face, as at first I made no doubt but that he had some
fatal news to impart unto me: When as he had obtained permission of his grief
to speak to me, and that he had acquainted me, that not only I should not be
his, but that I was already another, my affliction was so strong, that albeit
Octavio's was exceeding great, yet was it for him notwithstanding to comfort
me. He told me that our misfortune it may be was not without remedy; and that
if I had as much stedfastness, as he had love, I should vanquish my Fathers
rigor. Alas! said I unto him sighing, I will not bewail the tears which I
shall shed, if they may move his cruelty: but if they prove unprofitable to me,
continued she, what arms shall I make use of? Of those of your constancy, said
the unfortunate Octavio to me. Alas! cried Leonida in making this relation to
Alphonso, how often have I repented me for not believing him I and rather
choosing to obey my Father, then to be faithful to my Lover.

After this transport of affection, she recounted unto him all the resistances
she had made against her Parents pleasure; her grief and despair, when as she
saw that neither her prayers, her tears, nor her reasons could avail; the pain
she was in not to grant Octavio the permission to steal her away, or to rid
himself of his Rival; and for a conclusion, she acquainted him, how the tyranny
of her Father, and the consideration of her honor, having forced her to abandon
Octavio, to marry Livio, she saw her self in so deplorable an estate, as that
which would have made up the bitterest grief of another, was her only
consolation. For, said she to Alphonso, I had no other in this encounter, then
to know that I married a man whom I could never love, no not if time should
cure me of the passion I was in. It was not because I was not resolved for my
own glory to live well with him, but because I had at leastwise this
consolation, that Octavio could not suspect me of infidelity; yea and I hoped
too, that the more pe^vish Livio should be in his humor, and the more cankered
and unpleasing he should be, the more he would shorten my days. Judge then, said
she unto him, if these were the most agreeable thoughts that I had, what the
rest were.

But in the end, said Alphonso unto her, you married Livio? Yes, answered
Leonida with tears; and the unfortunate Octavio, unable to resolve to see me in
the possession of another, departed from Genoua to go and seek for the death
which he found soon after. For although I had done an hundred things beyond
what was fitting, to oppose my self against my Fathers will, yet he believed
with reason, notwithstanding he knew that I loved nothing but him, that seeing
I could not be married without mine own consent, I should never have granted
it, and that I should rather have resolved to dye, then abandon him. In so
reasonable a thought, despair seizing on his soul, he went to the Emperors
Army, and arrived there so unluckily, both for himself, and for me, and so
opportunely for the design which he had, that the next day there was a battle
sought; but before he entered into it, he desired to let me understand, that he
went not so much to expose his life for the Emperor, as for the love of me. In
saying so, Leonida let him see the Letter which Octavio had written unto her;
and whereas I have found it extremely moving, and that it is not long, I think
if I do not remember the words precisely, I shall meet with at leastwise the
true sense of it.

OCTAVIO'S Letter to LEONIDA.
Being unable either to cease from loving you, or to see you in the possession
of another, I am going to seek for death, as the only remedy which I can find
for my grief. And without complaining, or murmuring, I wish that the blood,
which I am going to shed, may not cost you too many tears, and that the end of
my life may not trouble the tranquillity of yours.


When as Leonida had made Alphonso read this doleful Letter, what shall I say
to you more, said she unto him with her eyes full of tears? Octavio, after he
had given this Letter unto a man that served him, with an express charge to
keep it, and deliver it to mine own hand, if he returned not from the danger,
whereunto he was going to expose himself in that deadly battle. Whereupon he
put himself into the foremost Troops, without any other Arms then his Sword, to
the end he might not fail in his design: Yet left he not for all that to sell
his life very d^ar to the Enemy, for he was seen to do wonders. But when he
heard the retreat sounded, because night approached, far from retiring with the
rest, he ran into the midst of a body of Horse, and defending himself no
otherwise but to provoke them the more, and to keep himself from being made a
prisoner, he fell at length, and found the death which he sought for. But
alas, he dyed rather by my hand, then by the Enemies! After this, said she, I
concealed our affection no longer, and I gave so many marks of despair, as my
Father himself repented his having rendted me so unhappy. A while after, Livio
fell sick and dyed, and left me the liberty to weep. Behold Alphonso, said
Leonida unto him, with as much grief as if Octavio had dyed the very same day,
that which you desired to know of me; but never speak to me more of him, I
beseech you; for as you perceive there is a kind of inhumanity in renewing so
sensible an affliction in my heart, and for which I should never be comforted,
had I not found in you some resemblance of the humor and dispossion of the
unfortunate Octavio.

Leonida, having finished her relation, and wiped her eyes, thanked Alphonso
for the sadness which appeared in his countenance; imagining that it was an
effect of the compassion he took of her past misfortunes. But she knew not,
that the same which she believed to be a sense of pity, was one of the most
violent jealousies that ever an amorous spirit was tormented with. For he so
strongly persuaded himself that Leonida could not have the same apprehensions
for him, which she had had for Octavio, as he went away from her, with an
affliction the like whereof was never seen; yet he left her without giving her
any notice thereof: but when he was come home, and had shut himself up alone in
his Chamber, he ran over all that, word for word, which Leonida had told him,
for they had made so powerful in impression in his Soul, as I think there
escaped not so much as one out of his memory. The more he considered the
matter, the more was he confirmed in his jealousy. He remembered, that she had
loved Octavio, out of sympathy, out of acknowledgment, and out of reason; that
their affection began from their infancy, and continued all their life. Now,
said he to himself, Octavio is not dead in the heart of Leonida, he lives there
still in despite of me, and in such a manner as I cannot chase him from thence.
He is not only dead to keep me from being revenged of him, but he is also dead
to reign eternally in her soul. For, added he, quite transported with grief,
unfortunate Alphonso, Leonida loves thee not neither but for the love of him;
thou know it from her own mouth, and thou can not doubt of thy
unhappiness. Ah how wretched I am, continued he, and how Imprudent have I been
in laboring mine own ruin my self I if I had not been curious, I had been the
happiest of men, and I have rendered my self the most unfortunate that ever was.
That which I have seen, that which I have heard; the tears of Leonida, her
sighs, her speeches, and the marks of love and tenderness, which she has
rendered to the memory of Octavio, have not only destroyed my present
pleasures, and all those which I hoped for, but also my pleasures past. I no
longer marvel, continued he, if Leonida ill-intreats my Rivals, it is for the
ashes of Octavio that she has this respect and this fidelity, and not for me.
O blessed Octavio, cried he, how worthy of envy is thy fate, and how unhappy is
mine! This fantastical jealousy got such deep rooting in his heart, as he lost
all rest, and almost his Reason. He wished sometimes that Octavio were still
living, to the end he might be revenged of him; and by and by after in another
quite contrary thought he considered, that if he had been living Leonida had
never loved him, and in this manner he was in some sort glad that he was dead.
Sometimes likewise, he comforted himself for that Leonida had not loved Octavio
so much as to marry him against the will of her Parents; but then when he came
to remember the last marks of affection which Leonida had received from
Octavio, and what resentment she had testified for it in relating it to him, he
entered into despair again. What can I do, said he, that can ever persuade her
that I love her as well as Octavio! When I shall tell her, that she raigns in
my heart; that her will may dispose of mine; that she is absolute Mistress of
my soul; and in conclusion, that I live not but for her alone; with one only
word, she will set Octavio above all that I have said; for telling me that he
dyed to testify his affection to her, is to tell me, that he has incomparably
done more then I; that he raigns always in her mind; and that I can never
pretend to the first place.

Of all the thoughts that afflicted Alphonso, that of his not being loved by
Leonida but because he had some conformity with Octavio, was the most inhumane;
and the opinion which he had, that since this was the cause of his Mistresses
affection, she could not therefore see him without remembering Octavio, troubled
him in such fort, as he continued certain days unable to resolve to visit her.
Nevertheless there were some instants, wherein he condemned his transports; and
demanding of himself what he desired of Leonida in this occasion? he knew not
very well what he would have; but these good intervals lasted so little it
while, as it might have been said that he had no rest at all. If I had a Rival,
said he sometimes, I should spend a part of my anguish in seeking occasion to
hurt him, and to set him at odds with her I loved, and whom he should love; I
should observe their actions, and knowing them, I should make use of them,
either to trouble their designs, or to advance mine, or to cure me of my
passion. But is the case stands, I have a secret Rival in the heart of Leonida,
whom she entertains, I not knowing, nor being able to hinder it: She weeps, she
sighs, even as she is talking with me, for this blessed Phantosm, which she
loves still, and ever will love, since he is no longer in a condition to be
able to do any thing that can displease her. As for me, said he, I am in far
other terms; for I can easily displease her, and I cannot be agreeable unto
her, but because I resemble Octavio. Who ever saw, continued he, such another
thing? I am jealous, and yet I have no Rival; I am beloved, and yet I am not
happy; and through an extravagancy of my destiny, or of my humor, I shall never
be; let Leonida do what she will, it is impossible that ever I should be so.
For say I should marry her, it would always run in my mind, that if by a
miracle Octavio could rise again, she would abandon me for him: Yea and I
believe, added he, that if she could buy his life with my death, she would
consent unto it with joy.

This deadly thought seized so strongly on Alphonso's heart, as there were
certain moments in which he had as much hatred for Leonida, as he was capable
of. For whereas this extraordinary jealousy agitated all his passions, and
principally hate and anger, not finding a nearer object to employ them upon, he
had for her no doubt very different thoughts, and wholly replenished with
violence. Love remained nevertheless still victorious over all the rest, or to
speak more rightly, all those several passions were but effects of that same.

But in the end, after Alphonso had spent some days in the entertainment of his
anguish of mind, without seeing Leonida, the extreme love which he bore her,
carried him to her whether he would or no. He has told her since, that being
gone out of his lodging, with an intent to walk in some place out of the way,
that he might muse by himself better then at home, and exactly run over all the
favors which Leonida had conferred on him, to the end he might compare them
with those which Octavio had received from her; he acquainted her, I say, that
against his purpose, and without being aware of it, his steps conducted him to
her door, where he no sooner was, but without consulting what he was to do, he
knocked there, and understanding that Leonida was within, he went up directly
to her chamber without advertising her of it, though it was not his custom so
to do; for Leonida seldom ever saw him at her house, when she was alone there;
but at this time Alphonso was not in a case regularly to observe good manners.
When as Leonida first saw him, she received him somewhat coldly; for whereas he
had been a good while without sending to her, or enquiring after her, she
thought it was but just to use him so.

As for Alphonso, how disordered soever his mind was, yet durst he not make
show at the beginning of that which he had in his heart; for respect and Reason
had so much power over him, is he could not resolve to discover his suffering
to a person who caused it, until he should be extremely pressed thereunto by
her. After Leonida had received him somewhat coldly, and had observed the
change which jealousy had made in Alphonso's face, the anger wherein she was
in for his neglect turned into unquietness. She was afraid left some mishap had
befallen him; or through some adventure, which was unknown to her, Alphonso
should accuse her unjustly of some defect of affection: In this belief she used
him more favorably; asked of him whether his melancholy was feigned or true;
and urging him to answer her, she forced him to tell her a lie, in such
perplexed and obscure terms, as she doubted not but that he had some unpleasing
thought in his mind. She employed all her address then to discover it by the
several questions she asked him: but seeing she nothing prevailed thereby, and
that the more she demanded of him, the less she was satisfied, she did him the
favor to deal with him as a M stress, and absolutely commanded him to tell her
what that trouble was which he had in his Soul. You have assured me an hundred
times, said she unto him, that I could do any thing with you, and that your
heart was not so much in your own dispose as in mine, wherefore then, if you
have not deceived me, do you not obey me? When as I promised you that which you
say, replied Alphonso, I hoped that I might, if not reign in your heart, at
leastwise not be surmounted there by any body.

Leonida perceiving then, that jealousy was the disease that tormented him,
and knowing that she had given him no reasonable occasion for it, fell a
smiling, and reaching him her hand with that gallantry, which is so natural
unto her, Affict not your self, said this amiable creature, nor fear that I
will be displeased to understand that you are jealous; I know, said she unto
him still smiling, that we fear to lose the good which is extreme dear to us;
that jealousy is an undoubted sign of a strong passion, and of the merit of
the person whom one loves, because if she were not amiable she would have no
Lovers, and consequently she would give no cause of jealousy. And I am the
less offended, continued she, to see you touched with this passion, in regard
it is easy for me to help you. For to speak more seriously to you, added
Leonida, you have no Rivals which can keep me from giving you the pleasure when
you will to hear me termed by them, cruel, inhumane, rigorous, and inexorable.
In fine, said she unto him, you have a malady, whereof you shall no sooner have
acquainted me with the cause, but you shall be cured of it.

I do not think, answered Alphonso, with as much anguish, as Leonida had
gallantry, that it is as easy for you to restore tranqu^llity unto my Soul, as
it was easy for you to deprive me of it: for, continued he, I have no Rivals,
whom you can ill entreat, and yet I am the most jealous that ever was. I do not
understand you, said Leonida to him with more coldness then before; and if you
do not explain your self better, I shall believe that either you have lost your
Reason, or that with a premeditated design you purpose to break off with me:
But take heed Alphonso, of leaving me long in this suspicion, for fear lest,
whereas I am proud and disdainful, I do not prevent you, and it be too late for
you then to have recourse to my goodness.

Alphonso, surprised both with Leonida's discourse, and the manner wherewith
she spoke, resolved at length freely to tell her the cause of his grief. I know
very well, said he unto her, that I am going to speak in vain for my self, and
indeed it is rather out of despair then Reason that I am carried to obey you.
Know then, continued he, that I am jealous, and that I shall be so eternally,
since the Rival that surmounts me in your heart can never dye; for to conceal
the truth from you no longer, the blessed Octavio is the object of my
jealousy. The tears which you shed for his memory are the cause of those which
I shall pour forth all my life time; the sighs which you fetch for him, shall
always make me sigh; and his past felicity shall beget the misery of all the
rest of my days. You have loved him so much, continued he, and you love him so
much still, that I can find no place in your Soul: He much reign there alone,
for indeed you do not suffer me there but only to conserve the memory of him
the better. Ah cruel man! cried Leonida hearing him speak in this sort, is it
possible that you have the inhumanity to open the Tomb of Octavio to persecute
me? and in stead of weeping with me, or at leastwise of bemoaning and
comforting me, you are so audacious as to give me marks of your hatred to a
person, whom I have so much loved, and whose memory is still so dear unto me;
and yet in grateful as you are, said she to him, you owe the affection which I
bear you to that little resemblance you have with Octavio; but as this
unfortunate creature has been the cause of it, so shall he likewise give an
end to it: for in regard of that which you have said to me, I ordain you never
to speak to me, and never to see me more. Why do not you shut your self up then
in Octavio's Tomb, answered Alphonso, since you can love none but him? Reply no
further to me, inhumane that you are, said she to him, and take from my sight
the persecutor of Leonida, and the enemy of Octavio.

Alphonso seeing Leonida in such choler, and not able to give her a good
reason, either for the maintaining of his error, or for the obtaining of his
pardon, went away more jealous then before. Alas, said he to himself, how
sensible she is on that side I what a powerful mark of her love is her choler!
if she had loved me, she would have used me after another manner; she would
have taken pity of my weakness; she would have given me some new proof of her
affection; but she could not disguise her heart; all her thoughts have been for
Octavio, and all her words have been against me. In this opinion Alphonso got
him home, with an intent to obey Leonida exactly, and never to see her again.
As indeed he came no more at her, and that be might avoid meeting with her any
where, he feigned himself sick. Leonida, seeing to what a madness this
ill-grounded jealousy carried him, desired at leastwise to conceal it from the
eyes of the world; and to that effect she advanced a voyage which she was to
make to Albengua, where, as you know, she has some means and affairs. She
departed then from Genoua, so incensed against Alphonso, that she could not so
much as resolve to do him the favor to complain of him by a Letter. Her
departure did not cure Alphonso of his frenzy, but contrarily it augmented it;
for he believed that Leonida did not abandon Genoua, but to bewail Octavio with
the more liberty. This thought for all that was not the most powerful in his
heart; the impossibility of seeing Leonida, redoubled his desire of it, and
love being stronger still then jealousy, he purposed an hundred times to go to
Albengua, to cast himself at Leonida's feet; to crave her pardon; and to obtain
an oblivion of his fault of her. But no sooner did the Phantom of Octavio
present it self to his imagination, no sooner did he call the tears and sighs
of Leonida to remembrance, but he re-entred into his former furies. He made an
hundred impossible wishes, which destroyed one another, and led a very irksom
and melancholic life. During that time he wrote diverse Letters to Leonida,
according to the diverse thoughts wherein he was; but when as she perceived so
great an inequality in his mind, and such marks of an unsettled Reason, she
returned no answer thereunto; and although she loved Alphonso so much, as to be
extremely grieved to lose him, yet could she not imagine how she might cure him
of this fantasy: so that finding no expedient for it, and being very much
incensed against him, she lived with so much anguish, that if Alphonso had
known her most secret thoughts, he would have been healed of his jealousy, and
would have been assured that she did not grieve more for the death of Octavio,
then for the loss of his affection. It was in this sort then that Leonida and
Alphonso lived until that unfortunate day, wherein we were constrained to
forsake Genoua. And I make no doubt but that Alphonso's despair induced him to
follow us, as well as the generosity which he testified to us in this occasion,
in not abandoning us in the sorrow we were in, since he absented himself from a
place where Leonida was not. You know in like manner, what that Tempest was,
which luckily for him drove us to Albengua; neither are you ignorant how the
compassion and generosity of Leonida obliged her to imbarque her self with us:
But doubtless you do not know, what Alphonso's and her thoughts were, when as,
after they had had the goodness to lament our misfortunes, they had the leisure
to think of the terms wherein they stood. For whereas we had scarcely been upon
the Sea without a Tempest, without fear of death, and without extreme sorrow
for the loss we sustained there, they had never talked together in private
during this troublesome Navigation; but when we were at Marocco, and at those
times, wherein we had the liberty to see and speak to one another, Leonida, who
desired to conceal the terms wherein she was with Alphonso, entertaining him
with indifferent things, found that his understanding was as deeply wounded at
Marocco, as it had been at Genoua, with this difference nevertheless, that at
the first time he spoke to her he moved her to anger, and the second time he
moved her to pity. What is the reason, said he to he with tears, that I can
neither continue loving you, nor begin to hate you? and wherefore, since you
are capable of some affection for me, must I not only share it with another,
but I must owe it wholly to him? and without being able, either to change my
passion, or revenge my self, I must eternally be the most wretched of men.

He that imposes a necessity on himself, replied Leonida, cannot complain with
reason, seeing he himself is the cause of the evil that arriveth to him. Ah,
cried Alphonso, that you said true! and that I could dispose of my thoughts!
Yes, Leonida, said he unto her, would I could love you less, to the end I might
love you always, and live happily in sharing your affection with another: But
to endure, that in speaking to me you should always think of Octavio, that
whilst I sigh for love, you should sigh for affliction, and having absolutely
given you my heart, I should have but a piece of yours, is that which I cannot
suffer. But how is it possible, said Leonida interrupting him, unjust and cruel
Alphonso, that a man, who is no longer in an estate to have any affection for
me, can give you jealousy? You do not comprehend, replied he, what is the true
cause of jealousy; the affection Which any one should bear you, would not
displease me; it is of your thoughts that I am jealous, and not of those of
others. I would be willing chat you should be loved, and that you should be
adored, but I would have you love none but me. I should not care to see you
have an hundred Lovers, provided I were alone in your heart; I do not hate my
Rivals in their person, but in yours only; it is you that can increase or
diminish the hatred which I have for them, by the good or bad usage you shall
give them; and whereas you may love Octavio as well, though he is not in being,
as if he were living, you are not to think it strange that I am jealous. In
fine, continued he, you reduce me to those terms, that I had rather you should
not love me at all, so as you would love nothing, then to love me as you do, in
loving Octavio better then me. But Octavio is no longer in being, said Leonida
to him sighing. Yet he is still in your Soul, answered Alphonso, and this sigh
which you fetched testifies it but too much unto me. No, no, Leonida, said he
unto her, that which I suffer is without remedy; one may sometimes make present
mishaps cease, and decline those which may happen unto us in time to come, but
when we are unhappy by the remembrance of that which is past, death alone can
finish our pains: It is not in your power to forbear sighing, shedding of
tears, and to say all, loving of Octavio more then Alphonso, wherefore marvel
not if it be not in your power to cure my mind of the jealousy that possesses
it.

It was much after this sort that the first conversation ended, which Leonida
and Alphonso had together at Marocco. But whereas Leonida affected him, and saw
the estate whereunto this fantastical jealousy reduced him, she opened her
heart to me, and having asked my advice what she should do, I counseled her, I
think, as she desired to be, and as indeed was just. I told her then, that she
was to do all that she could to set his heart at rest! that this
caprichiousness proceeding merely from an excess of love, she was to pardon so
bad an effect, since it came from so noble a cause, and labor to restore his
Reason to him, which she had deprived him of. I agree with you, said she unto
me, that Alphonso is to be eased, but in what manner do you think I may do it?
if he were jealous of the French Marquess, of Doria, or of any other, it would
not be difficult for me to satisfy him. The coldness which I would show to
them, should soon set him at rest; and if there were no other means for it, I
would deprive my self absolutely of their company to preserve it; but as the
case stands I know no remedy for it. It is from my self that Alphonso has
learnt the affection which I have born to Octavio, I cannot unsay it; and if I
should be so base as to swear to him that I have not loved him so much as he
imagines, I should tell a lie to no purpose; it being very certain that he
would give more credit to my tears, then to my latter speeches; and then again,
that is a thing I could never do. Counsel me then, continued she, how I shall
carry my self. I profess unto you, that I was then very much perplexed what
counsel to give her, for I saw no assured means that could cure Alphonso:
Nevertheless after I had mused a little, my opinion was, that the only thing
which she could do was, to endeavor to persuade Alphonso, that she loved him as
much as she had loved Octavio, as indeed, I think I did not oblige her to tell
an untruth.

At first Leonida told me that this would serve to no purpose, but finding
nothing to stand with more reason, she resolved to follow my advice: So that
the first time she could speak with Alphonso in private, his melancholy still
increasing, she demanded of him, whether he were resolved to live long in that
manner? Truly no, answered he, for I do not doubt, but from the misery which I
feel, death will come shortly and deliver me. Is it not possible, said she,
that Alphonso should make use of his Reason in this encounter? I perceive very
well, answered he, that you have some pity of the hurt you have done me, but
know that it is not that which I desire; in the estate wherein Octavio is I
could endure that you should have compassion for him, provided you would have
affection for me; but I could not endure, that you should have love for him,
and have nothing but pity for Alphonso. What change, said she unto him, is
there come to me, since the time that you were contented with my affection?
have I loved Octavio more, or have I loved you lest then I did? in no wise at
all, I swear unto you. Wherefore then since I am not changed for you, are you
changed for me? If I had known my unhappiness sooner, replied he, I should have
been less unhappy; it being certain, that I should not have engaged my self so
straightly in the love of a person, that could never love so much as she had
loved. It is true, said she unto him, that I have loved Octavio as much as I
was able to love in the age wherein I was; and it is true also that his memory
is dear and precious unto me: but who has told you that I have not the same
thoughts for you? I know it from your own mouth, replied he; for in having
assured me that you loved me less then he, you have let me understand that you
have done that for his consideration, which you have never done for mine. You
loved him as soon as ever you opened your eyes, said Alphonso unto her; he was
agreeable unto you as soon as ever you knew him; and your Reason has told you
since, that you would have done out of choice, what you had done out of
inclination; he has had the happiness to please you always, without ever
giving you cause to be displeased; you have sighed for him in diverse occasions;
you have many times bewailed his absence as much, as I could pretend to be
lamented by you, if I had lost my life in your service, and for my last
unhappiness he dyed in speaking to you of love. It may be, if he had lived
longer, you would have repented the tears, which now you shed for him; but as
the case stands, there is a shadow of Octavio remaining, which is in stead of
his person to you, that possesses your soul, and will not suffer you to have
such thoughts for another.

How unjust you are, said Leonida unto him, to speak to me thus! howsoever,
since I am resolved to try whether I can draw your mind out of that disorder,
whereunto, this strange jealousy has carried it, promise me, that if by my
discourse I can let you see, that you have received more testimonies of my
affection, then I have given to the infortunte Octavio, you will then repent
you of your error, restore tranquillity to your soul, and leave mine in rest.
Alphonso, after he had withstood it a while, in saying, that she propounded an
impossible thing to him, and by consequence he was not to answer unto it,
resolved for all that to hear her, and promised her that if she kept her word
with him, he would crave pardon to his fault, and would live better for the
future. After they had made this agreement; tell me, Alphonso, said she unto
him, if I can make it appear to you, that since the day wherein I permitted you
to serve me, you never have had occasion to complain of me; and if I can show
you, that the unhappy Octavio, if he were living, might with justice accuse me
of little affection; would you not have reason then to be contented? That will
not be enough, answered Alphonso, for it may be that you have never given me
just cause to complain, and that you have given Octavio occasion so to do, and
yet for all that I cannot be happy: But that which I desire is, you would let
me know, that you have not done any thing for Octavio, which you would not have
done for me, and that I think will not be easy for you to perform.

I will peradventure show you yet more, replied Leonida, and to begin to cure
you, is it not true, Alphonso, that the original of the affection which I bear
to you, is far more advantageous to you, then that which I have born Octavio?
when I began to wish him well, continued she, I was in an age, wherein
perchance that which I then called love, was none; wherein I counted for great
services petty things, which now I should not regard; and wherein I acted
without knowledge, and without judgment. I, said Alphonso interrupting her, but
not without inclination, which is that which renders affections the stronger
and more durable. I agree with you therein, said she unto him, but howsoever I
had this inclination in an age, wherein at first my reason did not combat with
it, for I had none at that time. That is the cause, said Alphonso, why it is so
will settled in your soul. And that is the cause, replied Leonida, why I do not
know whether it were any whit strong, since I did not make resistance against
it. But as for you Alphonso, when as you began to please me, and that my
inclination carried me to like of your services, I was in an age wherein my
Reason was in a condition to oppose it self against it; as indeed, it did
resist it as much as it could. You had to vanquish in my heart, not only that
wisdom and that modesty, which permits not a woman to engage her self lightly
in affection to a man; but had also the memory of Octavio to surmount, in
forcing me, if one may say so, to commit a greater infidelity against him, then
when as I abandoned him to obey my Father; seeing it is certain that I married
Livio without loving him, and that I could not keep the promise which I had
made to my self, never to love any thing more after the death of Octavio.

This discourse is very subtle, replied Alphonso; but have you not told me that
you did not love me but because I resembled Octavio? I have indeed told you,
answered she, that by this resemblance you comforted me for the loss of
Octavio; but not, that this conformity, which you have with him, was the only
cause of the good will which I bear you. And certes, to speak truly, since I
must retract what I have said with shame, if there had been no other then this
reason. and that my inclination, your services, and your merit, had not
constrained me; I should rather have avoided the sight of you, then sought it:
It was not ye^ so long since I lost Octavio, that I could behold his picture
without tears and sorrow; I should rather then have shunned you with care, then
received you favorably, had I not been forced by a power, which I could not
resist. You make me new wounds, said Alphonso thereupon to her, in seeking to
cure the old; for if it be true that you have this intention, why do you tell
me that the sight alone of one of Octavio's pictures has made you weep? I told
it you, replied she, to let you see, that a man which could comfort me for so
excessive a grief must needs have a great deal of power over my soul.

Alphonso, not able to contradict Leonida, suffered her to continue her
discourse. You perceive very well then, said she unto him, that in the
beginning of our good will I gave you more marks of a strong inclination, then
ever Octavio received of me, seeing when I loved him, I was in an age, wherein
flattery, complacency, and gallantry, do extremely touch the mind. Octavio was
my first conquest, and the first man that told me I had something that was
pleasing in me: and by this reason, it was almost impossible for me not to have
admitted of his affection: But for yours, I accepted of it in such a manner, as
would not permit you to doubt of mine, if you be reasonable. And to pass from
the beginning to the progress of it, tell me, I pray you, what is that I have
done for him as long as he lived? All things, answered Alphonso; and whereas
more marks of affection are given by grief, then by joy, without running over
all the complacencies which you have had for him, I will only say that you h^ve
wept an hundred times for him, and that all the love which I have born you has
not cost you a tear.

It is not time yet to discover my weakness unto you, replied Leonida; and to
answer precisely to that which you say, as long as we lived well together, it
is true that I have not wept, but it was because you were not unhappy; and I
doubt not but if our affection had been thwarted as Octavio's and mine was, I
should have had the same sorrow. And then again you have this advantage over
that unfortunate man, that I have not forsaken you, as I did him; for indeed if
I had known how to love perfectly, I had not married Livio, I had not abandoned
Octavio, I had not been the cause of his death. Therefore it is, answered
Alphonso, that to repair that failing, in not loving Octavio enough, you love
his ashes and his Tomb; you cannot speak of him without tears; you cannot think
of him without sighing; and it may be if I should lose my life, I should not
give you a minute of unquietness. Ah cruel creature I cried Leonida, must I
acknowledge my weakness unto you? Yes, insensible as you are, said she unto him,
I will resolve to do it, to the end I may cure your mind, or have so just an
occasion to complain of you, as absolutely to cease from loving you. It is
true, said she unto him, that I have wept for Octavio; but it is true too, that
spite of the grief, which your capricious humor has possessed me with, I can
assure you, not only that I should dye with affliction, if your death should
happen, but that I cannot call that a life which I have led since thus unjust
passion has troubled my rest in troubling yours. In fine, Alphonso, I have
shed as many tears for the fear alone of losing your good will, though you were
faulty toward me, as ever I shed for Octavio, who dyed for my sake; so that if
I am unjust, it is only to him, and no way to you. It is true, that he has
rendered me all the testimonies of affection that I could attend from him; but
it is true also, that I have not done the same; I abandoned him to marry Livio,
and I have been capable of a second love, which without doubt must be stronger
then the other was, because it has been able to comfort me for the loss I had
sustained: For you, Alphonso, it is not so; you have no occasion to complain of
me, I have done for you all that reasonably I could do; and when I gave you a
mark of my desire to please you, it is come to pass that out of an unheard of
inhumanity, you have made use of the same Arms, which I gave you, to combat me;
my ingenuity has been the cause of your malice; and mine innocence has made
your crime. In conclusion, Alphonso, said she unto him, with a countenance
wherein appeared more grief then choler, you must resolve upon the choice of
two things, either to quit your error, or never to see me more. For, continued
she, I can no longer endure to see you in the disposition you are in; but know,
unjust and cruel as you are, that if you choose the last, you will peradventure
be constrained to have, whether you will or no, ere it be long, more affection
for the ashes of Leonida, then you have had for her her-self.

Alphonso, touched with so obliging a discourse, and not able to resolve to see
Leonida no more, cast himself at her feet, and having not the power, eith^r to
repent him of his error, or to crave pardon for it, or to say any thing that
might show he was not yet cured of it, he gave her so many testimonies of an
extreme love, both by his silence and by his tears, as Leonida being sensibly
touched with compassion, asked of him once again what it was he desired of her?
I know not, answered he, only I know that I can never cease from loving you,
nor ever separate my self from you. Be reasonable then, said she unto him, and
believe that nothing in the world is so dear to me as Alphonso. Have pity of my
weakness, answered he, and if you will have me comfort my self, say not, that
nothing in the world is so dear to you as Alphonso, but say without reserve,
that nothing is so dear to you as Alphonso. I know not, said she unto him,
whether I have ill expressed my self or no, but my intention was such as you
would have my words to be.

I should never have done if I should repeat all Alphonso's questions, and all
Leonida's answers; it shall suffice me then to say, that after an hundred odd
precautions, to assure himself of the love of Leonida against Octavio's
phantosm, whereunto this amiable creature out of her goodness answered
seriously, he returned to Reason, and certain days after craved pardon of her
for his error, and absolutely promised her never to fall into it again. I
believe notwithstanding that he was not so soon rid of it, and though he has
not spoken to Leonida since of it, because it was one of their conditions, yet
he has not for all that left off having many times very odd thoughts. This
dispute and this peace were so secret amongst us, that I was she alone who was
acquainted with it; and that was it which persuaded Horatio and the rest, that
Alphonso's melancholy proceeded from the jealousy he was in of the affection
which Aly seemed to carry to Leonida; but indeed it was that which I have
declared unto you.

The Marquis seeing that Sophronia held her peace, and that Leonida was going
to speak, as if she would have excused Alphonso: It must be acknowledged, said
he, that there is a marvelous diversity amongst men; and that which makes me
most to wonder, is to see by example, that Alphonso, who in all other
encounters has a great deal of wit and discretion, and would in indifferent
matters without doubt think the same things that I do, should fall into in
imagination so far distant from all good sense. I think, answered Leonida
smiling, that in matter of love, it may be said that you are both of you an
object of admiration and wonder the one to the other, but with this glorious
difference for Alphonso, that his fantastical jealousy was not derived but
from an excess of passion; and that your inconstancy proceeds not but from a
defect of love.

If the very excess of Reason, replied the Marquis, comes near to, folly, I
believe that this excess of love is not far from it: and if it be true, that by
the effects one may judge of the cause, acknowledge, fair Leonida, that this
inconstancy, which you call defect of love in me, gave you not so much
unquietness, when I abandoned you for another, as this excess of passion has
been the cause of to you; and confess withal at least, that it were better to
be loved of a man of my humor, then of that of Alphonso. It would be more
advantageous, replied Leonida very roundly, because as long as one should not
be loved but by an inconstant man as you are, one should not be exposed to the
hazard of too much engaging ones self in this affection. And then again,
continued she, there is this difference betwix: you too, that I have cured
Alphonso of his error, and that nothing can cure you of yours. You believe it
to be just, and you find it pleasant, judge then whether your disease be not
incurable?

For my part, said Hipolita, (who according to her humor always took jealousies
part) I cannot condemn Alphonso; nor should I be sorry that a man would render
me this proof of affection. You speak in this sort, said Doria interrupting
her, rather out of temperature, then reason; but whatsoever you can say, I do
not think that Horatio will become jealous out of complacency, and will open
Tombs to find a Rival there. It would be easier for me questionless to enter
into them never to come out again, answered Horatio, then to give this unjust
mark of love, to the person I affect. I believe what you say, replied Hipolita,
it being likely enough, that a man, who could see an hundred Lovers at the feet
of his Mistress without being disquieted at it, would be never a whit moved to
know that she should grieve for a dead man.

As for me, added the Marquis smiling, if by an inversion of all the ages it
might come to pass, that a person whom I should love had been beloved of all
the Heroes of antiquity; that they had all dyed for her, and that the ashes of
the Cesars and the Alexanders had been the object of her tears, and of her
love, I should be less jealous thereof then of the least amongst the living;
and there is not a man, how misshapen soever he could be, that would not more
disquiet me to see him on his knees before my Mistress, then Alexander would in
the state wherein he is, should he reign in her heart, as he reigned over all
the Earth.

I confess, said Sophronia laughing, as well as the rest of the Assembly, that
in this occasion I am of the Marquis his side, for I cannot but follow Reason
wheresoever I meet with it. I perceive, said Leonida then, that all the world
abandons me, and that I have need of Alphonso's assistance for the vanquishing
of so many Enemies. I am generous enough, answered the Marquis, to go and fetch
him my self; and saying so, he went and called Alphonso, who was almost ashamed
to come unto the Company again, making no question but that they had condemned
his jealous humor. And whereas Leonida perceived it, Fear not, said she unto
him, as long as I am on your side, you will have no Enemies which you may not
overcome; and doubt not that the remembrance of an error, which I have
pardoned, can make me angry with you. I believe you to be too just, replied he,
for me to suspect you of any such thing, only I fear that you will be accused
for using too much goodness toward me, and that by this means I should be the
cause of condemning a virtue in you, which makes one to be commended in all the
world besides.

If we engage our selves in making of complements, said Sophronia interrupting
him, the Marquis will not be able to pay me that to day which he ows me, and so
we should spend the time less pleasingly then otherwise we might do if we gave
him audience, for I assure my self that he cannot tell us any thing but what
will delight us. I do not know, answered the Marquis, whether this discourse be
advantageous to me or no, howsoever, since I have promised to relate that unto
you which befell me here in Constantinople, I will not break my word. And then
again, continued he, to speak sincerely unto you, I shall have a share in the
pleasure which I shall give you; it being most cerain, that I am of a humor to
receive more satisfaction by recounting the adventures which have happened unto
me, be they never so happy, then I had at such time as they arived unto me. In
fine, continued he, I comfort my self for mishaps in telling them to others,
and I augment my good fortune in publishing it.

Seeing it is so, said Leonida, haste you to satisfy Sophronia, in satisfying
your self, and be not of the number of those, who make one hope so long for an
indifferent pleasure, as one is not obliged to them for it. All the Company
having added their entreaties to Leonida's discourse, the Marquis acquitted
himself of his promise in this sort.

The History of the too good Slave.
NEver was any so happy in servitude as I, and never did happiness produce an
effect like unto that which I am going to recount unto you. You remember
without doubt, that when we arrived all at Constantinople, and landed at the
Port, there was a man, who rightly imagining by the chains we had on us, that
we were destined to be sold, and finding something in my person that pleased
him, bought me for the price that was demanded of him. This man, who was my
first Master, carried me home to his house: and whereas he was one of the
mightiest men in Constantinople, I was comforted in my misfortune to see, that
at leastwise if I were a Slave, it should be in a place where I should have
companions. I was no sooner come thither, but to testify that he had some
inclination for me, he caused the chains that I had on me to be taken off, to
give me lighter; so that desiring to be acknowledging for this favor, and
render my slavery also more easy, by making myself be beloved of those, who
might ill-intreat me, I became in two hours the best Slave that was in
Constantinople. I did not only that which was ordained me, but I also helped
others to do that which had been commanded them. And whereas it is the custom
of the Turks, as I learned afterward, carefully to observe all their new
Slaves at their first coming, my Master was a witness of all the services which
I rendered him, and seemed to be so satisfied with m^, that all the other Slaves
began already to hate me.

The first day being past over in this sort, the next morning my Master would
needs have two wives that he had to see me; he commanded then that I should go
to their lodging, and whereas I knew not whither they led me, I was so
surprised with their beauty, as I could not forbear testifying a great deal of
joy by my carriage at it. I found them so much the fairer, because for four and
twenty hours before I had seen none but black Slaves; I saluted them then very
civilly, and beheld them at leastwise with as much attention, as they had in
considering me: and without regarding whether my Master took it well or no, and
without remembering that I was a Slave, I thought of nothing but of making show
with low obeysances, as often as I could judge by their behavior that they spoke
of me, that I was as respectful for them, as I was serviceable and diligent for
their husband. But at length he commanded me to withdraw, which presently I
did; true indeed it is, that it was not without turning back my look to the
place where I left two fair women, and truly I felt some pain in separating my
self from them.

I was no sooner gone down, and had done something which had been enjoined me,
but I went with all speed into a back Court, upon which the windows of these
women's chamber opened, out of a hope that I might peradventure see them again:
But by ill fortune my Master was there as well as they; so as having observed
that I had nothing to do there, I cannot tell you whether he suspected the
truth or no, howsoever without having any cause to complain of me, he commanded
me to be conducted the next morning to the Market where Slaves are sold, and
that there they should rid themselves of me at any price whatsoever. I must
confess to you that this change surprised me; nevertheless whereas I comfort my
self easily, as you know, in all things, I resolved for patience.

He that next bought me was a Merchant of Tripoli, whom I served as exactly as
the other: And whereas in these kind of houses the restraint is not so great,
as in those of persons of quality, I had some content to see that in serving my
Mister, I should at leastwise have the satisfaction to meet sometimes with a
wife that he had, and two Greek Slaves that served her, and that certainly did
not shame their Nation. I got their good will the very first day, without being
able to tell you how I did it. If they saw that I had a purpose to go forth,
they went in all haste to open me the door; if I carried any thing, they
presently offered to help me; in conclusion I won their inclination in such
sort, as my Master hated me for it. For when he was withdrawn to his chamber,
his Wife and the Slaves praised me so much, as out of jealousy and
covetousness he resolved to be rid of me. He feared lest his wife would love me
too well, and that his Slaves would agree together with me to rob him.

In this thought, he conducted me himself to the Market; but whereas he was
known to be one of the most avaricious men in the world, it was not very easy
for him to get me another Master: For although he assured them which cheapened
me, that I was the most dextrous, the most serviceable, and most diligent Slave
that ever he had had, yet no body would believe him; because out of the
intention he had to rid himself speedily of me he set me at too cheap a rate.
Certainly, said they who were willing to buy me, this Slave must have some
great defect, which we know not of, seeing the most avaricious man that is
resolves to part with him at so low a price. He is young, he is not unhandsom,
he seems not to be melancholic; so that without doubt he has taken him in
some theft, or else he would never be so forward to sell him.

In this opinion no body bought me the first day, nor on the second neither.
Howbeit my Master, having observed that his Wife and Slaves were very glad to
see me brought home again, he purposed to part with me for less then he had
intended, hoping thereby to be the sooner rid of me. But he considered not,
that out of the opinion the world had of him, the less he should ask for me,
the more he would be troubled to sell me. And verily there was never any
pleasanter thing, then the choler of this covetous wretch when as he could not
resolve to lose his money, and was constrained in the evening to carry back to
his house a man, whom he beheld as his Rival, and yet had no cause to complain
of him. For whereas I was not ignorant, that Slaves in this Country are at
their Masters mercy, the fear of some cross adventure made me very prudent, so
that as long as my Master could see me I did not answer the complacencies of
his Slaves. Wherefore not being able either to sell me, to complain of me, or
to resolve to give me my liberty, because he would not lose but a part of the
money he had given for me, he was in an unquietness which I am not able to
represent unto you.

But at last on the third day a Boluchbassi, who had cheapened me when first he
would have sold me, and who imagined that I could have no other defect then of
being unfaithful, tempted by the good peniworth, resolved to take me into his
service. And to secure himself from the vice whereof he suspected me, he
purposed to employ me in his Garden, until such time as he had made trial of
my fidelity. I was then conducted home to his house, where I no sooner was, but
having g^ven me wherewith to labor the ground I found my self at first somewhat
troubled. Nevertheless whereas I had whilst I was in the Wars helped many
times out of a bravery to cast up Trenches, and raise Forts, I became in two
hours so good a Gardener, as I levelled an Alley better then all they of
Constantinople could have done.

My address having pleased my Master, he brought three Wives that he had,
followed by all their Slaves, to see my work, which they admired; and passing
from the commendation of my work to that of my person, they said too much for
themselves, if they took any pleasure in seeing me. Nevertheless it was not
that alone which made me change my dwelling, but it was for that, my Master
being gone a little way off, and that I saw all these women walking still about
me, without making show of heeding them, and as if it had been to render my
labor the less irksom, I set my self to sing indifferent loud. My voice pleased
them in such sort, as I thought they would never have left me; and when I
perceived the satisfaction they received by it, I did nothing but sing, out of
a hope that at leastwise I should not always be alone in this Garden. But for
fear my Master should think that it was only for his Wives, or for their Slaves
that I sung, I never gave over; so that if I had continued in that manner any
long time, I should, to speak poetically, have dyed like a Swan. My invention
failed not in the expected success, as also it failed not in making me to be
turned away. For I no sooner began to work, but I began to sing; and presently
not only all the Slaves, not only all the Officers of the house, but even my
Masters wives, who were wont to fear the Sun, and to walk but very seldom, came
in all haste to hear me: A Slave could not be sent any whither, but she would
still make it her way to go out at one of the Garden doors; and how pressing
soever the matter was about which she was sent, she would hide her self behind
some hedge to hear me; and in this sort, though I wrought very diligently, yet
left I not incommodating my Master, because I kept all his servants from doing
their duties. This man had so much goodness, as he could not easily resolve to
forbid me from singing; imagining that I had no other design then to drive away
melancholy in doing my work. Howbeit, seeing at length that he could not be
served by his people, and that even his Wives could not be kept in the house,
he absolutely forbad me from it, and I obeyed him without resistance. But this
which he thought to do for his quiet, and to retain me in his service, was that
which troubled him the more, and made me to be turned away. For no sooner did
his Wives and his Slaves know of the prohibition he had made me, but there was
a strange disorder in the house. Both the one and the others murmured alike;
Who ever saw such cruelty, said they, as to forbid a man, laden With irons,
and that does his duty so well, from singing? this tyranny is so excessive, as
is not to be endured, and certainly the like was never heard of. In fine, this
murmuring and this revolt went so far, that this man to be at rest resolved to
sell me away, which he did the next day with a great deal of regret, because I
pleased him extremely.

It was my destiny to be bought by an Arabian Physician; for whereas he had
asked to what employment I had been put in my Masters house, and had been
answered that I was an excellent Gardener, he imagined that I knew some
Simples, and consequently might be useful to him, by reason the Physic of this
Country consists much therein. In effect, he acknowledged that he had never
been served more diligently; and albeit I was very ignorant in all the things
that he made me do, yet my address and confidence supplied that defect. This
Physician had two daughters, who having lost their mother lived alone with him;
so that whilst he was in his visits, I had sometimes the pleasure to see them.
For whereas the women of Constantinople are very curions of their beauty, the
desire they had to gain me, to the end I might give them certain waters for the
face, which their father would not let them have, made them use me very
civilly; and for fear I should be put away, they taught me all tha^ I had to do
the best they could.

I had no sooner made an end of whatsoever the Arabian Physician had commanded
me to do at his going forth, but I went to entertain his daughters at a lattice
window that was very low, and teach them new means to become fair, which I said
I had learnt in Italy; so that when my Master came home, he never found me
amongst his essences: yet he could not complain of me, because whatsoever he
had ordained me to do, was always performed. He imagined then, that since I was
so diligent, he was to give me more employment, for fear lest out of idleness I
should have too much conversation with his daughters; but whereas they were
dextrous, they perceived his design, so as finding that to busy me, besides
necessary things he had left me great store of Grite roots to prepare for the
Baths, which are so frequent in this Country, they made me give them part of
them; so that all three working, the business was quickly dispatched, and we
had time enough besides for conversation: In so much that my Master coming home
in the evening, with an opinion that he should find me very busy, and a belief
that he had met with an excellent expedient to keep me from entertaining his
daughters, he was strangely surprised to see me labor no more then I was wont
to do. Nevertheless he could not resolve to quarrel with me, having never been
so well served as by me.

In this unquietness he took a new resolution, which was to enjoin me to wait
upon him in the streets, and to leave him in my place who was usually to
accompany him. But these maie's were no less witty in this occasion then the
other; they won this Slave with money, and dealt in such sort, as when we came
home, there was nothing done of all that had been ordained him; and this out of
the hope that their father would alter his mind, and not carry me any more
abroad with him. This slight notwithstanding wrought that which they expected
not; for the Physician, seeing that when he carried me abroad with him, none of
his work was done; and that when I stayed at home, his daughters always sent
for me, resolved to sell me. And truly I was not sorry for it, in regard I had
but little knowledge in the mingling of Drugs; and in my ignorance, I could not
find out a better invention, then when as my Master named one to me, which I
knew not, to choose another, which had no ill quality; to the end that at
leastwise if I did no good, I would do no harm.

In going from thence, I was bought by two Janissaries, who having demanded of
me in that corrupted Italian, which every one understands at Constantinople for
the commodity of commerce, whether I could carry their Arms, and keep them
bright? When as I answered them, that I would do it as well as I could, they
agreed of the price, and carried me home with them. And whereas I was better
seen in the use of a Scymitar, then in the knowledge of the virtue of Simples,
the manner wherewith I handled theirs when they came to their house pleased
them in such sort, as I was their well beloved Slave. I looked upon the blade
of it like a man that was not ignorant thereof; I knew of what temper it was,
and by my behavior they judged, that War without doubt had been my Trade.

Now you must understand, that these two Janissaries had each of them a fair
Slave; and that as long as I was with them, though they were both of one
company, yet were they of a different Squadron, so that they were not both upon
the Guard at one and the same day; by which means one of them always remained
at home, as it were the Guardian of the two Slaves. In the mean time I
acquitted my self admirably of the employment had been conferred on me; and
never had their Arms been so well kept, as since the time that I had been in
their service. But if they were contented with me, no less were the two Slaves,
though I contributed nothing thereunto: For by reason of that which I told you
in the beginning, I was never less a Love, then in all these several
encounters, albeit I was never so much beloved. These fair Slaves did not for
all that testify unto me both at once the good will they bore me; and out of a
particular address they those the day wherein the Janizary that was their
M^ster was upon the Guard, so that he which stayed ^^^me very well perceived
the care and complacency which his friends Slave had for me; but ^hereas he was
contented with my service, and saw that I contributed nothing thereunto, he did
not advertise him of it. The same reason which this Soldier had, the other had
also; and by this means I was for some time equally beloved of both the two
Janissaries, and of the two Slaves. It happened at length, that by order of War
these two Janissaries were put into one and the same Squadron, and thereby would
have been constrained to leave me alone with their Slaves, being obliged to go
upon the Guard the same day, had they not bethought themselves of telling one
another that which they knew concerning the good will these Wenches bore me.
Wherefore considering how they were equally interessed in the business, they
disputed a good while betwixt themselves what they were to do. At last, though
they loved me exceedingly, they sold me that very day, not being able to
resolve to leave me alone with their Slaves.

The fantasticalness of my fortune so wrought, that a Musician of this Country,
who taught to play on the only Instrument which they have at Constantinople,
and that holds somewhat of the form of the Lutes of Italy, took me into his
service, and carried me home with him. The next day after my coming thither,
when he was gone abroad, I took one of those Turkish Lutes (for he had many of
them,) and whereas this Instrument has but one string, I thought, that if I
could put more to it, this Harmony it may be would please my Master, and might
obtain my liberty. I took one of those Lutes then secretly, and going to one of
those that makes them, who dwelt hard by this Musicians house, and whom I had
by chance taken notice of as I came thither, I directed him how I would have it
done. At length I made him fit this Lute for seven ranks of strings; and
whereas I had still one of those enamelled Gold rings left, which are worn
rather out of gallantry, then for their value, I gave it him for payment of his
pains. Being returned home, I put strings to this Lute, and beginning to touch
it, I drew to me with my harmony my Masters wife, two sisters that he had, and
three Slaves. So that when he returned, he found me in the midst of all these
women, who harkened to me with a great deal of delight and attention. At first
he was angry, both with them, and with me; but coming to hear me himself, he
pardoned them their curiosity, and hoping to gain good store of money by my
means, he caressed me extraordinarily. He undertook notwithstanding to maintain
against me, that in something their Lutes were more perfect then ours; because,
said he, having but one string they can never be out of tune. This pleasant
reason being nothing hard to be destroyed, I made him easily comprehend, that
my Music was better then his; and the very next day he carried me to all the
houses, whither he used to go; where they had no sooner heard me, but they
would hear him no more. This man being as proud as he was covetous, although I
might have got him a great deal of money, yet could he not resolve to carry me
any more along with him; so that purposing to learn to play as I did, he left
me at home; and mornings and evenings only I took him out Lessons. But I was
not long both his Master and his Slave; for when as he was no less jealous then
proud, knowing that his Wife, his Sisters, and his Slaves, did nothing but
harken to me, out of a capriciousness worthy of him, he resolved to sell me.
Neverthel^ss it was not without a great conflict in his mind; and vanity,
covetousness, and jealousy, gave him no little trouble.

This last passion being the stronger, he sought to rid himself me; and had so
much malice, that to keep me from teaching some other that which he would not
learn of me himself, he went to sell me at the Port, where I was presently
bought by the Captain of a Galley, who was upon going forth to scour the Seas.
I confess that this adventure vexed me; for considering that I left you all at
Constantinople, without knowing whither I went, I was out of quiet above an
hour at least; howbeit I hoped to meet with some good fortune which I did not
foresee; and in this thought I served my new Master with as much care as I
could, yet was I not long with him, for whereas he was avaricious, and had no
need but of one Slave, that could row, he was persuaded that he might sell me
for so much, as he might therewith get two in stead of one; so that all the
endevor which I had used for two days space, to show him the greatest address I
could possibly express, served not but to make me be sold away the sooner, and
to give me a Master of an higher condition then those last I had had; for
whereas the price which he asked for me was great enough, I was no longer
cheapned but by persons of quality. The Cadilesquer then of Natolia became my
Master, and to his house I was carried; but from him I parted a little after
for the like reasons; then was I entertained by the Muphti; and the next day
after I past into the service of the Aga of the Janissaries, where they that
sought for me by the Grand Signior's command found me. Indeed it is true, that
I should not have been long there, for I was to have been sold away again the
very same day.

In conclusion, after I had had for my Master a great man of the Port, a
Merchant of Tripoli, an Arabian Physician, two Janissaries, a Player upon the
Lute, an African Captain of a Galley, the Cadilesquer of Natolia, the Muphti,
and the Aga of the Janissaries; after, I say, I had equally satisfied them all,
Fortune at last restored me to liberty. And truly I was not a little obliged to
her for so far complying with my humor, as not to let me wear the same chains
long; it being most certain that I should have been dead with grief, if she had
used the matter otherwise. For is it credible, contined the Marquis, that a
man, who could not live long under the Empire of one only Mistress, whose
dominion is incomparably more gentle then a Merchant of Tripoli's, could have
lived long under that of an imperious Master? And to say all in a word, it is
easy to be imagined, that if I had still worn but one chain, it would have
seemed very heavy to me, seeing even bracelets of hair would incommodate me if
I should wear them long. Change is the charm of all pleasures, and the ease of
all sorrows. There is not an evil, how little soever it be, that would not
become insupportable to me, if I should always endure it after the same manner;
nor is there any which I should not bear with patience, if it were not always
the same. For in fine, whether it be for the pains of the body, or for the
pains of the mind, one cannot pass from one evil to another, without some
moments of rest. Change has this mavelous in it, that in pain it self,
manger that which we feel, it diverts, it eases, and fortifies us. And of what
humor soever we be, we think not so much of the evil that is arrived to us, but
that we have some joy for that which has left us.

You are too eloquent on this subject, said Leonida interrupting the Marquis,
and if I might be credited herein, both for the interest of public society,
and good manners, you should be prohibited from ever speaking in the behalf of
inconstancy: For whereas you have a great of wit; whereas also you speak as a
man interessed; and as a man that maintains his own cause, you may at length
p^rvert the good thoughts of some. If it be true, added Sophronia, that one
easily persuades others, when as one is mightily persuaded himself, I
acknowledge that by this reason, the Marquis should be the most dangerous Orator
in the world. If I had established my doctrine well, answered he, you should be
constrained to acknowledge, that it is not contrary either to common society, or
the public good. For never has any inconstant man precipitated himself;
never has any inconstant man killed his Rivals, nor ill-intreared his
Mistress; and fire, sword, and poison, are things of no use in nature to him;
but he leaves them to the disposing of all those obstinate Lovers, who always
render themselves unhappy, in following this constancy, which you term the
Queen of all Virtues. We are not to judge always of things, replied Doria, by
the event; and then in this occasion, it is not Constancy that makes Lovers
unhappy, but Fortune, that delights to persecute Virtue; and in this sort, even
unhappiness serves for the glory of which are constant.

For a conclusion, answered the Ma^^uis, I know full well, that if Justiniano
had not been constant, he should not be now absent from his Mistress; he had
not been banished from his Country; he had not been a Slave; he should not be
in Persia, and in jeopardy to dye there. If Isabella had not been constant, she
should not be in the old Serraglio; and if all you that are here had not
followed this goodly virtue, you had not sighed so much as you have done, and
peradventure you should not be at Constantinople. If that be a punishment of
our fidelity, replied Alphonso, you must at leastwise acknowledge, that that
which you call our chastisement, is your recompense, seeing you are here as
well as we. It easily appears, answered the Marquis, that I am not unhappy but
for your sakes; for do not you see how Fortune has made be beloved of all my
Masters, of all their Wives, and of all their Slaves? and to work a prodigy in
favor of me, she has caused them all to turn me away without hating me. I must
confess, said Hipolita, that this adventure is altogether extraordinary, and
that it is not a little strange to imagine, that that which should have made
you use but one chain, has made you change it so often. You know me but ill,
fair Hipolita, answered the Marquis, when you speak to me thus; for I can
always break my chains, but never wear them out.

After this, all this fair Troop ran over the Marquis his adventures again, and
not able to forbear laughing at their imagining him a Slave to two Janissaries,
a Gardener, a Physician, and a Merchant, they figured him such to themselves as
he had been in all those diverse employments which he had had. And he himself
represented them unto them in so diverting a manner, as manger their ancient
miseries, and those wherein they still were, they passed away all that day
without annoy, without care, and without melancholy.

The End of the second Book.
The Third Book.
Whilst this agreeable Company endeavored to forget their present misfortunes,
by remembering those which they had avoided; Isabella was in an extraordinary
melancholy, although she was as yet but in the apprehension of an evil that was
to arrive unto her. Every time that she heard her chamber door open, she always
believed that Soliman was come to discover his un^ust passion to her; and every
time that the Sultana Asteria went from her, it seemed to her that she
abandoned her to the Sultan's violence. There were yet some times wherein she
condemned her own thoughts; and wherein Emilia's speeches gave her some
consolation. These good intervals for all that lasted not long; and how
constant soever Isabella was, she was always nearer to despair then to
tranquillity. On the other side, Soliman was in no less pain; his love, his
virtue, and his irresolution upon that which he was to do, put his Soul into so
great a disorder, as he then merited to be as much lamented, as blamed.

But at length, whereas it is hard to consent to the rendering of ones self
unhappy for another felicity, and to renounce things out of generosity which
one ardently affects, Soliman's Reason being combated by his own desires, by a
violent passion, and by the Artifices of Roxelana, it found it self in the end
so weak, as he absolutely resolved to speak to Isabella of his passion. I know
very well, said he to himself, that this is to betray the friendship which I
have promised to Ibrahim; but I know withal, that it would be the betraying of
my self, and the cause of my death, if I should bereave my self of the hope
which I have of prevailing one day with Isabella.

In this resolution, Soliman went to the Princesses chamber on a time when as
the Sultana Asteria was come from her, and that none but Emilia was with her.
When as first the Princess saw him, she changed color; and Soliman on his
part, who very much respected her, and that still loved Ibrahim, thought to
alter his resolution; and in this sort, fear troubling Isabella, and respect
silencing Soliman, they were a while unable to speak to one another. The Sultan
was he at last that began the Conversation, in craving pardon of Isabella for
the constraint wherein she lived. My Lord, said she unto him, since it concerns
the quiet of thy State, I dare not murmur at it; and though the privation of my
friends be a displeasure sensible enough, I do endure it without complaining of
thy Highness; I do accuse Fortune, and do justify Soliman, who without doubt
will never be but equitable. Would to Heaven, said he unto her, I might be sure
that you would speak thus always! My Lord, replied she, this is a thing which
will absolutely depend on thy Highness; it being most certain that I shall ever
be reasonable, and not be so inconsiderate as to think ought to the
disadvantage of thy Majesty, if I be not constrained thereunto by thy self. I
could have wished, replied Soliman, that without exception you had promised me
never to think amiss of me; for it may be you will learn from mine own mouth
that I am faulty.

Isabella blushed at this discourse, and casting down her eyes without daring to
look any more on Soliman, and being unable to answer him, she was a pretty
while in this incertainty: but on a sudden, Soliman, carried away by his
passion, resolved to discover it unto her. I know full well, said he unto her,
that I am going to destroy my self; that in acquainting you with my thoughts, I
am going to make you hate me; but I would sain have you tell me, added he,
before I confess my crime unto you, whether an error, which is not voluntary,
merits as much chast^s^m^nt, as a pr^m^ditated malice? My Lord, answered
Isabella, all persons that have great Souls like thy Highness can never commit
faults but voluntarily. There is nothing that can ^orce Reason when one will
make use of it; and the most violent passions without doubt are but the pretext
of weak ones, when as they will excuse the bad actions which they do; it being
certain, that it is not impossible to furmount them. I knew well enough, said
Soliman interrupting her, that you would be a rigorous Judge to me; that you
would judge of others by your self, and that you would condemn in another, that
which is not found in you. But, amiable Isabella, continued he, you are unjust
to deal so; seeing it is impossible that ever your Soul should be put to so
difficult a trial, as that is which I have encountered. You have but weak
enemies to sight with, and a great deal of virtue to resist them; your Reason,
in what a occasion soever you find your self, is always on your side; but,
amiable Isabella, in this wherein I am, my Reason is my cruelest enemy. It is
not because she has not opposed all my thoughts as much as she could; and this
is it which puts me out of all hope of vanquishing, having no longer arms to
defend me. For my Reason has been so absolutely surmounted, as it is rather by
her then by my passion, that I am resolved to discover my hurt unto her which
has caused it. Let thy Highness take heed, said Isabella to him then, that in
discovering it thou make it not the worse; and that that which thou believe
would be a remedy for thy grief, be not a means to increase it. That which you
say, answered Soliman, may easily fall out; but, continued he, what would you
have a Prince do, who is no longer Master, either of his heart, of his soul, or
of his will; who se^s his death indubitable, if he conceals the disease
wherewith he is stricken? and who is absolutely resolved to dye, or to move the
person whom he adores with love or pity.

Isabella, knowing not what to answer to a discourse which she understood but
too well for her rest, fetched a great sigh in lifting up her eyes to Heaven,
as it were craving succor from thence; which Soliman having; ob^erv^d; I
perceive, said he unto her, incomparable Isabella, that you have understood me;
that you are not ignorant of the Conquest you have made; and I thank Fortune,
for that she has not compelled me to tell you that I love you, so to make you
know it; for it is certain that I should have been much troubled to execute the
resolution which I had taken for it. But after I have persuaded you, continued
he, without giving her leisure to answer him, that Soliman adores you, suffer
not that, which has accustomed to be beneficial to all Lovers, to be
prejudicial to me. For, added he, I see very well, that the more I shall
persuade you that I love you, the more you will hold your self injured by m^.
But to take away at leastwise the means from you of reproaching me with my
crime, I will acknowledge, divine Isabella, that I know being your Protector, I
ought not to be your Lover; that loving Ibrahim as I do, I ought not to be his
Rival; that respecting you as I ought, I should not use any discourse to you
that offends you; that loving glory, I ought not to endure an affection which
may blemish it; but I know, more then all this, that love never shows it self,
either greater, or more perfect, then when it destroys friendship, forces
Reason, and without considering either honor or glory, carries us to dye, or to
make our selves be beloved of the person whom we adore. This, incomparable
Isabella, is the estate whereunto you have reduced my Soul; but if
notwithstanding I may be permitted to employ Reason for the obliging of you to
pity, remember that you would be unjust in causing the death of a Prince, who
heretofore has saved Ibrahim's life; and that cruelty can never pass for a
virtue. Be then in some sort indulgent to my passion, and at leastwise bemoan
the hurt which you have done me.

Soliman holding his peace, and Isabella being somewhat come to her self again;
Is it possible, said she unto him, that this which I hear is true? and that the
greatest Prince of the Earth should be the weakest amongst men? No, I cannot
think it; and the discourse which thy Highness has used to me, is doubtless a
design to prove my constancy and resolution. But, my Lord, to oblige thee no
longer to continue so dangerous a fiction, know, that if it were true that thy
Highness had for me the violentest affection that ever was heard spoken of, it
should not serve but to hasten my death; it being most certain, that the most
terrible and horriblest torments that can be imagined should never carry me to
be wanting, either to that which I owe to Ibrahim, to my self, or to thy
Highness. No, my Lord, I should never be a Complice of great Soliman's fault;
and for his own interest I ought always oppose my self against him. But,
continued she, it is in some sort an injury to thy Majesty to answer so
precisely to a discourse, whose foundation is not tru^. Would to Heaven,
replied Soliman, both for your content and mine, that it were so! But, amiable
Isabella, it is but too true what I say; and if there be any feigning in my
discourse, it is that I have not said all that I feel. I confess, that I am
faulty toward Heaven; that I am so toward Ibrahim; that I betray the
friendship which I have promised him; that I forget the care of my glory and
honor; and that I betray my self; but in conclusion, being faulty toward all
the world, I am innocent toward you; since it is certain, that a violent love,
to speak reasonably, can never offend the person that has begotten it. And how
constant soever you be for Ibrahim, how rigorous foever you be for me, you
cannot without injustice but take pity of the deplorable estate wherein I am. I
do not demand of you your love as yet, but some compassion; and at least bemoan
me, if you cannot love me.

Great Princes, replied Isabella, ought to be sensible of pity, but they never
ought to put themselves into a condition of being the object of it to others:
Neither will I be drawn to believe that Soliman has a thought so unworthy of
himself. For, my Lord, how can I think that thy Highness will stab a Poignard
into the heart of Ibrahim, after thou have saved his life? if it should be so,
it had better, both for him, for me, and for thy Highness, that he had been
left to languish in his irons, or to dye of melancholy, then to save him for to
kill him the more cruelly. Let thy Majesty consult well with thy self, and thou will find without doubt, that thy heart agrees not with thy mouth; that thy
words betray thy thoughts; and that Ibrahim is yet more powerful in thy Soul,
then the fatal beauty of Isabella. No, said Soliman interrupting her, do not
justify me in this sort; since in the terms wherein I am, I have no other
design, then to let you know, that I am the most faulty of all men, in
persuading you, that I am the most amorous. Ah, my Lord, said she to him
weeping, does not thy Highness consider, that at this very time it may be,
wherein thy Highness uses so strange a discourse unto me, Ibrahim is fitghing
with thine enemies, is hazarding his life for thy service, and shedding his
blood for a Prince, who makes me shed tears, and who without doubt will bring
me to my grave, if his unjust love does continue?

Soliman being moved with so pressing a discourse, stood a while without
answering thereunto; but at length his passion still surmounting his virtue in
this occasion; I know, said he unto her, that Ibrahim's life ought to be dear
unto me; but I know withal that mine ought to be considerable to me: and I am
certain, that what exploits soever he can do in Persia, I have done more yet in
consideration of him. I have fought for him against my self; I have felt my
self in the flame without daring to complain; love and friendship have torn my
heart; and I know no torments so terrible which I have not endured since the
first instant that I saw you, rather then to do any thing against the affection
which I bear him. But being come to the terms, either of dying, or speaking, I
chose the last; and so much the rather, because I do not think but a man, who
could abandon you at Monaco, to come unto me to Constantinople, will easily
enough resolve to quit you, for the saving of a Princes life, to whom he is
indebted for his own. Ah, my Lord I cried Isabella, if Ibrahim be faulty in
this occasion, it is against me, and not against thy Highness, who by this very
fault art yet the more straightly obliged not to commit one against him. For what
does not a man deserve, who rather then he would fail in his word which he had
given thee, resolved to abandon, not only his Country, not only his Friends;
but the only person whom he could love; who was in stead to him of all the
world; and without whom his life had been irksom, and death the term of his
desires? No, my Lord, continued she, flatter not thy self in this occasion;
think better, both of Ibrahim and of Isabella, and be most assured, that as I
am certain he would dye a thousand times rather then abandon me, so should I do
the like, rather then be unfaithful to him. And if by some prodigy, which I
cannot fear should happen, Ibrahim should consent to thy passion; if he himself
should speak to me of thy love, yet let thy Highness know, that I am not
capable of failing by example. I should cease to love Ibrahim, if he ceased to
be generous, but I should love thee never a whit the more; contrarily, I should
regard thee then, both as having outraged me, and as having bereaved me of a
virtuous Lover.

Isabella was going on in her discourse, and Soliman was going to interrupt
her, when as the generous Asteria entered: And whereas the Sultan had still
some respect for Isabella, he would not command the Sultana to withdraw; but
being unable withal in the estate wherein his Soul was to begin an indifferent
Conversation, he went away, leaving Isabella with an affliction, that may be
better imagined then described. He was no sooner departed, but Asteria, who had
observed a great deal of alteration in Isabella's and Soliman's faces, demanded
of her with much impatience and grief, what it was that had caused the trouble
wherein she saw her. Alas! answered the Princess, how have my fears been too
well grounded, and how true have your suspicions been! and then she recounted
unto her what had past betw^^n her and Soliman, with so many testimonies of
resentment, that the Sultana Asteria was exceedingly moved therewith. This
misfortune did not altogether surprise her for all that; because she had
sufficiently observed in diverse occasions, that the Sultan her father was
desperately in love with Isabella; but she had nevertheless conserved some
remainder of hope, that his reason, and the friendship which he bore to
Ibrahim, would surmount his passion, or at leastwise keep him from discovering
it to her. Isabella for her part had thought as much, so that being equally
surprised, one might almost say, that they were equally afflicted: For whereas
the Sultana Asteria was extremely generous, she was grieved not only for
Isabella's interest, whom she very much loved, but also for the Sultan her
Fathers; who by this unjust passion blemished his glory, and did a thing
unworthy of himsef. She feared likewise that this love might have dangerous
consequenc^s; for she was not ignorant to what extremities this passion had
carried the mind of Soliman in diverse occasions; and so being in much
unquietness, she was very incapable of comforting Isabella.

It was in vain for them to seek for some remedy to their misery; it was too
great to find one for it. Emilia propounded nevertheless unto them, the
advertis ng Ibrahim of the outrage was done her; but whereas he was too far off
for them to hope for any succor from him, this advice was but a weak
consolation to Isabella. Howbeit she desired the Sultana Asteria to endevor the
finding out of means to convey a Letter to Ibrahim, which the Sultana promised
her to do; upon condition that she might obtain of her generosity, that he
should be contented with delivering her, without enterprizing to be revenged on
Soliman; for, said the Sultana to her, Were not the Grand Signior my Father,
knowing him as I do, I could not choose but have compassion of the estate
wherein I see him. If he were not generous, he were not to be lamented; but I
am well assured, continued she, that he punishes himself in off riding you;
that the remorse which he has in his Soul torments him as much as his passion;
that at the very same time when as he speaks to you of his unjust passion, he
craves pardon in his heart of the generous Ibrahim; and that he repents at that
very instant wherein he commits the fault. Alas, cried Isabella, how dangerous
is this unprofitable generosity! and how little difference is there betwixt a
man that does ill without knowing it, and another that knows virtue, and is
not able to follow it. Repentance, continued she, that begets no change in the
mind of him that repents, is rather a weakness, then a remorse. But, said she
to Asteria, I desire you to pardon me for not remembering that you are the
daughter of Soliman; and I promise you, if Ibrahim can return before the
Sultan's love has laid me in my grave, and that he can deliver me, to obtain
of him that he shall not think of revenge: and I am very certain, added she,
that what affection soever Ibrahim bears to me, he will be grieved to hear that
which we will write to him, but will not conceive any hatred against Soliman.

After that these three afflicted persons had talked a good while of this
subject; and that Isabella, having written to Ibrahim, had given her Letter to
the Sultana Asteria, she tried with gifts to gain one of the Eunuchs that
served them, to the end he might fly out of the Serraglio, and carry this
Letter to Ibrahim with as much speed as possibly might be: but it fell out,
that after Soliman had been at the Princesses lodging, there had been such an
express Order given, tha^ none should be suffered to go out of the old
Serraglio, as it was impossible for her to execute her design, and that was it
which redoubled her affliction, and that of Emilia and Isabella. But if these
three persons were afflicted, Soliman was not without unquietness; that
constancy which he had noted in Isabella's mind extremely afflicted him, by
making him see an impossibility in his design; yet out of an altogether
extraordinary persecution, that which opposed his love augmented it; and that
stedfastness which he had found in the Soul of the Princess was a new charm,
which rendered her yet more amiable.

Roxelana in the mean time, being advertised of all the Grand Signior's
thoughts, by that Slave whom he had made his Confident, carried him still on by
the means of the same Slave to violent resolutions; but whereas respect never
quits love, but when as fury and despair take up the place of it, Soliman
suffered not himself to be persuaded with facility to employ menaces, where
submissions are ordinarily most powerful. He continued then a long time in
testifying his love to Isabella with high respects, magnificent presents,
frequent visits, with tears, and entreaties: but the more submission he used,
the more constancy Isabella showed, and the more she made it appear that her
virtue was invincible. Nevertheless for all her rigor, and that love cannot
subsist, as they say, without hope, yet Soliman ceased to hope without ceasing
to love; and contrarily his passion becoming more violent, that little reason,
which had always made him retain some fear of displeasing Isabella, being
almost quite banished from his soul, he reso^ved to speak to her once for all,
to see if he could gain her. That which carried him the rather to this extreme
resolution, was the thought he had that it would not peradventure be long
before Ibrahim returned; and that a conqueror or conquered, the love which he
bare to Isabella would make him soon finish this war: for when as Ibrahim went
away with an absolute power to treat of all things, without having new order
from Soliman, he had assured him, that he would come and render him an account
of his voyage himself, without ever sending to him before.

The Sultan, not knowing then at what time Ibrahim would return, and well
foreseeing that his voyage would not be long, if by ill fortune he had not
received his last order, as he began to doubt, meant to try if he could obtain
that by fear, which he could not obtain by love. In the mean time Isabella
lived in so great a melancholy, that all her virtue and constancy were not
strong enough to keep her from wishing, that death would speedily deliver her
out of the deplorable estate wherein she was. She saw her self far from
Ibrahim, without means to hear from him, the place of her refuge become her
prison, the sight of her friends forbidden her, Soliman's persecution daily
redoubling; in fine, she was exposed to most sensible miseries without other
consolation, then that of the Sultana Asteria's, and her dear Kinswomans tears.
Her friends on the other side, were not without unquietness; so long an abode
at Constantinople possessed them with a great deal of grief; and the privation
of the sight of Isabella very much troubled them; but at length, nothing
resting for them but patience to mitigate their displeasure, they comforted
themselves as well as they could with the hope of Ibrahim's return, wherewith
they were still entertained from Isabella; who not able to diminish her own
misfortunes, endeavored at leastwise to flatter those of others with this hope
that she gave them: for the Grand Signior had still permitted her to send unto
them by a Capigibassi, in whom he absolutely confided.

All these illustrious persons being in this deplorable estate, Soliman, thrust
on by despair and his love, went one day to Isabella's lodging, having first
sent a Command to the Sultana Asteria to go to that of Roxelana, for she had
for a pretty while before been seldom absent from the Princess. This command
exceedingly disquieted the Sultana; but not able to do any other then
voluntarily obey a Prince, who had power and right to constrain her thereunto;
she left Isabella with Emilia, without letting her know any thing of the fe^r
she was in, that Soliman had a purpose to use some displeasing discourse to
her, seeing he removed her from her. Scarcely was she gone out of her chamber,
when as Soliman came in to it; and whereas it seemed to her that he had less
civility for her then he was wont; and that his looks gave more signs of
choler, then of love; she was in some joy, hoping that it may be her constancy
had so far provoked him, as to oblige him to turn her out of the Serraglio; but
she soon understood, that this incivility, and this choler was an effect of
his love. I see very well, said he unto her, that my visits do importune you;
that my presence displeases you; that my passion begets your hatred; that my
respects augment your pride; that my prayers render you in^xorable; and that
tears do harden your heart; Wherefore, continued he, I am resolved to take
another course. I have treated you too long as a Mistress, it is just then,
since you will not be so, that I cease to be a Slave: but whereas I cannot
cease to be a Lover, I must tell you once for all, that if by your cruelty I am
reduced to despair, I shall be capable of undoing others in undoing my self.
How, my Lord, said Isabella then to him, can thy Highness persuade me that
which thou say? No, no, continued she, I know thy virtue too well; and it is
as equally impossible for thee to possess me with fear, as with love; thou
may have unjust desires, but I hold thee incapable of a wicked action. Thou
may, I say, have weakness, but not cruelty; and love cannot produce in thee
the effects of hatred. It is not, added she, because I do not wish with all my
heart, both for thy glory, and my content, that either out of choler or hatred
thou could resolve to chase me from thy presence, and never to see me more.

The opinion wh^rein you are, r^plyed Soliman, that the same passion, which
carries me to persecute you, will keep me from hurting you, is that without
doubt which makes you speak with so much confidence; but know, that a Prince,
who sees nothing in his choice, but death or your affection, ought to
enterprise any thing for the avoiding of the one, and obtaining of the other:
It can never be unjust for him to think of his preservation; that ought to be
preferred before all other things. I have friendship for Ibrahim; I have
veneration for you; but I have also some interest in my life. I have done what
I could to procure my content, without troubling yours; but at length, seeing I
cannot do it, and that there is a fate which will not let me live without you,
I must seek out the means for it. Remember then, that he which craves your
affection, can command you; that he which offers you his heart, is not unworthy
your love; that Ibrahim owing his life to me, ougt to render it me in this
occasion; that after so many services, submissions, respects, sighs, and tears,
the anger and spite of being despis^d may seize upon my Soul: and for a
conclusion remember, that revenge is the d^light of incensed Kings; that
Ibrahim is in my Armies; that you have in Constantinople persons which are dear
to you; and that you are in the Serraglio.

It is true, my Lord, replied Isabella, that I cannot be ignorant of all these
things; but I know withal, that thy Highness commands, both in thy Armies, in
Constantinople, and in the Serraglio; and that cons^quently I have no cause to
fear any thing; but contrarily I think that Ibrahim, my friends, and I, are in
more safety in thy Estates, then in our own Country. And then again, my Lord, I
cannot imagine that the remembrance of Ibrahim is utterly defaced out of thy
memory; that a man whom thy Higness has so much loved, and so much obliged,
can be ill-intreated by thee; nor can I believe that Isabella can inspire thee
with such unjust thoughts; no, my Lord, I cannot think it.

Isabella, replied Soliman, has not poss^st me with unreasonable thoughts, I
have nothing but love for her; howbeit I must confess, that her cruelty
possesses me with fury; and that she may carry me to destroy all that I shall
think can ravish her from me; and cons^qu^ntly to do all that I shall believe
can serve my turn concerning her. This being so, answered Isabella, I need not
be threatened in the person of my friends, nor in that of Ibrahim, since on my
only will that absolutely d^p^nds which thy Highness calls rigor, and which I
term an effect of Reason and Virtue. For, my Lord, continued she, were not my
heart, nor my word engaged to Ibrahim; nay, had I as much affection for thy
Highness as I am capable of, yet should I not give thee more testimonies of it
then I have done. Were not my Religion, I say, different from thine, yet in
that I could not be thy wife, I should not be thy Slave, since the heart of
Isabella can never have thoughts contrary to her honor and her glory. The
Slaves of Soliman, replied he, are more then Queens of other Nations; and then
again, to say the truth, to have you command absolutely in my heart and soul,
is not to treat you as a Slave.

Isabella, thinking she was to speak more thoroughly to the Grand Signior, then
as yet she had done, and believing, that when he had no more hope, he would
have no more love, said to him with a more confid^nt voice then before:
Finally, my Lord, all that I can say to thy Highness, is, that if, forgetting
thy usual mildness and generosity, thou could resolve to carry me by fear to
that, which thou could not get by love; and for that effect would persecute
me in the person of Ibrahim, who is dearer then my self, to me I would see him
dye rather then change my resolution. Let thy Highness judge after this, whether
death can fright me, and whether fear has any power over my Soul. Consider
then that though thou have no hope left thee, yet thou have a mean left thee to
be g^nerous; but in fine, added she, let thy love in this occasion suffer it
self to be surmounted, either by reason, or by choler; have hatred, or
friendship for me; be my Protector or my Enemy: let thy Highness not see me but
to comfort me for the absence of Ibrahim, or never see me more. I know,
continued she, that I speak with a great deal of boldness; but, my Lord, since
my complaints, my tears, my prayers, and Reason it self have not been able to
obtain any thing of thee, it seems just unto me to tell thee once for all, that
nothing can change my mind; that neith^r ambition, nor fear, have any power
over my soul; that virtue only raigns there; and that thy Highness forgets
thine own glory to no purpose.

Isabella made this speech with so much firmn^ss, as Soliman not able to be
moved with compassion, suffered himself to be transported with fury; but in
such a manner, as there were not any threatenings which he used not to the
Princess. And for a conclusion, he said unto her as he was going away, if fear
can no whit prevail on your soul, no more shall pity on mine: we shall see in
the end, if you be not changed in eight days, whether your mind will be as
constant as you say; and you shall know, but it may be too late, that Soliman,
when he pleases, can tell how to make himself be obeyed at Constantinople.
After he had said this, he left Isabella, and abandoned her to her grief; which
Emilia saw to be so just, is she could not condemn her; and all that she could
do in this encounter was to weep with her. What a misery is mine! said this
unfortunate Princ^ss, after she had been a while without speaking; who ever
saw, continued she, a like adventure? The greatest and best Prince of the Earth
is become the basest and cruellest amongst men; he pays a generosity with
ingratitude; he betrays the friendship which he has promised; he violates the
law of Nations; my protector is grown to be my Tyrant; and whilst Ibrahim is
venturing his life for his glory, thi^ unjust Prince would make me forget mine;
but what say I? it may be that his cruelty will not rest there; he that can
betray what is most sacred in this world, that harkens not to reason, that no
longer knows virtue, may also be capable of a design to destroy Ibrahim: And of
all this, continued this Princess, Isabella is the cause: she alone is the
source of his misfortunes; she alone gave him encouragement to follow his
g^n^rosity, when as she made him return to Constantinople; for, continued she,
if I had effectually testified that I would not have had him gone; if I had
told him that the chiefest duty carries all the rest; that he was to have
considered nothing but me in that encounter, that one ought not to be generous
to the prejudice of the person beloved; and that in the end I had joined force
to entreaty; he had not returned; I had not been carried away by force; I
should not be at Constantinople; Soliman should not be my persecutor, and we
should not be separated: yet this is not my last fault, added she, I should not
have let him go into Persia, or resolved to have gone along with him my self:
but ala^s! who would not have been deceived therein, and how could I have
b^lieved that which now I see; my heart indeed advertised me that our
separation would be fatal to m^; but I foresaw not the mischief which was to
arrive unto me; it had not been so great, if it could have been foreseen. In
fine, said this illustrious Princess, I am come to that pass, as I can scarce
fear new miseries: I am in fear for my friends, I am in fear for my self, and I
am in fear for Ibrahim. There is a design on my glory, and on the life of the
person that is dearest to me in the world: after this, let Fortune do what she
will, she cannot increase my misery more. The like was never seen in any age;
the unfortunate illustrious persons of Antiquity had at least this advantage,
to be persuaded by the error wherein they lived, that their despair was without
crime; and that they might with glory finish their torments in finishing their
lives: but for me, I am to attend this succor from the pleasure of Heaven, and
from my grief alone; it is true indeed that I feel it so great, as it makes me
hope it will not be long.

Ah, Madam, said Emilia to her then, do not abandon me! and to oblige you
thereunto, remember that your death would be the cause of Ibrahim's. Let us not
call him any more so, said Isabella to her sighing, since that name has been
given him by our Enemies. Remember then, added Emilia, that Justiniano cannot
live without you. But remember you, replied the Princess, that Isabella cannot
live without glory; and that it will be far more advantageous for her to be
lamented by Justiniano, then to be exposed to the violence of a Prince, who can
be no longer moved, neither by my tears, by my prayers, nor by his own
inter^st. Saying thus, she perceived the Sultania Asteria coming in, who seeing
her weep, could not forbear weeping too, though she knew not certainly the
cause of it; and not daring to ask of her what she ailed, nor Isabella able to
tell her, so much was she oppressed with sorrow, they stood a pretty while
without speaking; but at length, the Sultana rightly imagining that Soliman was
the cause of this redoubling of grief, approached to the Princess, and taking
her by the hand: I do not ask, said she unto her, what makes you to weep, but I
ask of you, whether another bodies crime does not set me at odds with you, and
whether you can endure that the daughter of a Prince, who persecutes you, dare
still assure you, that she shares with you in all your sorrows. You may without
doubt, replied Isabella, and your compassion is so much the more generous, by
how much you are the less obliged thereunto; it being certain that you have
more occasion to regard me as the object of your hatred, then Soliman has to
consider me as the object of his love; for if this Prince had not seen me, he
would not be unjust; his violences would not give you unquietness; and your
Soul would not endure the pain that it feels, in condemning the thoughts of a
Father: but generous Sultana, shall we not find a remedy for the curing of
this deadly passion, and to set me in safety against his violence? Soliman's
interest ought to carry you unto it; and since Justiniano is already indebted
to you for his life, make him indebted to you also, if it be possible, for my
glory, which doubl^ss is dearer to him then his own; you have drawn him out of
Irons, draw me out of servitude; and by this noble action tender your self
worthy of immortal renown.

Asteria, not able to endure that Isabella should longer entreat a thing of
her, which she desired as much as she, assured her that she was capable of
undertaking any thing for her service; but that she was afraid all her
endeavors for it would do her no good. Thereupon Emilia and she bent their
minds to seek out some way, whereby they believed they might get out of the
pain wherein they were; they propounded an hundred expedients, whereof the
execution was impossible; and at last, after a vain search they concluded that
no succor could come to them but from Heaven; and in this belief they abandoned
themselves all three to grief; and said so many things, made such moan, and
shed so many tears, that if Soliman had been a Spectator of so sad a
Conversation, he would peradventure have been moved to repentance, but he was
in far other thoughts. It was not because, to render him the more unhappy, he
had not still some instants, wherein a beam of light cleared his mind, and made
him see his fault; but love was ever stronger then all his other apprehensions.
Isabella's resistance, the fear of our illustrious Bassa's return, and the
counsels of that Slave whom Roxelana had seduced, carried him to violence; and
albeit he had sent an Order to Ibrahim a good while before, whereby he forbad
him, upon some pretext that regarded the good of his Empire, from returning to
Constantinople, until he had a n^w commandment from him; yet not being assured
whether he had received it or no, he was always in fear of his return; for he
felt not his Soul so powerfully settled on his crime, that he could resolve, if
the grand Vizier returned before he could obtain Isabella's consent, to tell
him that he would not restore her to him. And for this reason it was, that he
was in such fear he had not received the Order which he had sent him; and
truly, this apprehension was not ill grounded, for he that had this secret
Command was drowned in passing over the river Tigris, before he could get to
Ibrahim; whose fortune had been as happy, as his dear Isabella's was
deplorable. It was not because the absence of a person whom he loved so
passionately, was not extremely sensible to him, nor possessed his heart with the
greatest displeasure that a Lover can be capable of; but the thought he had,
that he was going to fight for the deliverance of Isabella, gave him strength
to support his grief; which became less violent, when as being arrived at the
general Randezvouz, he understood of Vlama, who was come thither, and had
commanded in his absence, that all the Troops, which had been sent for the
fortifying of the Army, were the bravest in the world; and that by the
intellig^nce which they had from the enemy, it seemed that he had a design to
decide the matter by the loss or gain of a battle; how it was advertised that
Tachmas was in person in the Camp; that Deliment was there too; and that by
this means, if the victory inclined to their side, they should be in an estate
of vanquishing all their enemies together. Howbeit that he had a request to
make unto him on the behalf of the Princess Axiamira, whom he had left at
Bitilisa; which was to spare the person of Tachmas, as much as the confusion of
the fight would permit him; and to promise her if the chance of War gave him
the advantage, not to make other use of it then the concluding of a peace
between the two Empires, and the re-entring of her into her Country without all
future fear of Delim^nt's violences.

Ibrahim answered to this discourse with as much generosity, as Vlama had
testified affection in making it to him: and after they had spent some time in
talking of the order they were to observe in this War, they took a resolution
to make a review two days after of the Army, by a general Muster ther^of, to
the end that afterward they might march on courageously against the Enemy. All
the Commanders having received this Order, and having imparted it to their
Soldiers, they thought of nothing else for those two days, but of appearing as
gallant as possibly they could; and those which could not be rich in Clothes,
endeavored at least to have their Arms n^at and bright. At length the morning
being come, wherein Ibrahim had resolved to make a review of his Troops, he
went accompanied with Vlama to an indifferent great Plain; and being placed on
a rising ground, they b^gan to muster before him. The first that appeared were
composed of fourteen thousand Tartars, who by their precipitate ma^ch gave
hope, that they would not be the last at the fight when occasion served.
Fifteen thousand Azapes went next commanded by a Sangiac; and after them as
many Spachis, who being past, made way for a like number of Croatians, which at
last left six thousand Janissaries to be seen, the gallantest and best armed in
all this Empire. All the Infantry having past, the Cavalry followed after;
twelve thousand Archers first appeared; next to them ten thousand Accangis with
Scymitars and Battel-axes; and last of all fifteen thousand Timariots with
Guns. In the end Ibrahim found, that his Foot being threescore and five
thousand, and his Horse thirty and seven thousand, his Army amounted to above
an hundred thousand fighting men. All these Troops being past, the Artillery
appeared, consisting of above an hundred pieces of Ordnance, part of them for
battery, and part for the field, with the greatest train that almost has been
heard spoken of, were it for the abundance of Powder, and Shot, or Waggans for
the carriage of things necessary to furnish the Camp.

This review being ended, and Ibrahim thoroughly contented with it, he no longer
thought of any thing but of hastening his victory or defeature: so that to
advance it the sooner, after he had encamped his Army, and learnt in what place
the Enemy was, he resolved to write unto the Sophy, to the end he might oblige
him to the terminating of this War by a Battle. And to color the matter with
the public interest, though in this occasion it was effectively for the
interest of Isabella, he wrote to him in these terms.

IBRAHIM BASSA, By the Grace of Alla supreme Secretary, and chief Vizier of the
most mighty and most invincible Monarch, Sultan Soliman, his Lieutenant
General, and absolute Governor of the Affairs of his State, throughout the
whole extent of his most flourishing and great Empire.
To TACHMAS SOPHY of Persia.
THe Emperor, whom I serve, having done me the honor absolutely to refer unto
me the managing of the interests, which are between his Highness and your
Majesty; and knowing that all great Princes ought never to make War, but to
give the more sure foundations to Peace; and that they ought to spare the blood
of their Subjects, and keep them from ruin, as much as possibly they may; I
have believed, that without doing ought against the service of the Sultan, or
against the respect which is due to persons of your quality, I may at the
request of the Princess Axiamira, yield to the motion she has made unto me,
not to destroy your people with a long War. And to this effect, if your Majesty
pleases, we will shorten it with a Battle, which may decide the matter, and
render the victorious party Master of a Country replenished with Subjects, and
not of a Desert. But whereas it seems to me that the choice of Arms appertains
to him that is challenged, even amongst equal persons, knowing what I owe to
your Majesty, it is for you to make choice of the day of Battle, and of the
place of sighting; for so as it be equally advantageous, I shall receive it
with joy, since whatsoever shall happen in that day cannot be ignominious to
me: For if I be vanquished, the glory of the Vanquisher will make me to be so
without disgrace; and if the chance of War shall make me happy, nothing will
equal my glory, but the courtesy which I shall have for your Highness, if
Fortune does furnish me with means for it. I shall expect then your Majesty's
pleasure thereupon, with the same respect, as I would have in all other
encounters, the interests of my Master preserved.

IBRAHIM.


After the grand Vizier had finished this Letter, he sent for Vlama to show it
to him, who having approved of it, besought him withal, that he would permit
him to send a Challenge to Deliment, thereby to oblige him to a single Combat
before the Battle, if it happened that Tachmas should resolve to accept of it.
Ibrahim did what he could to divert him from this design, persuading him, in
regard Deliment's birth was so unequal to his, that he should do him too much
honor. But Vlama's great heart, together with the desire of revenging the
Princess Axiamira, and pleasing of Felixana in punishing Deliment, would not
suffer him to be persuaded: So that having obtained that which he demanded, he
went presently to draw up his Challenge, which he wrote in these terms.

ULAMA's Challenge to DELIMENT.
OUt of the fear I am in lest the day of Battle proving fatal unto you I shall
not be able to revenge the Princess Axiamira with mine own hand, I thus send to
offer you the Combat; and though there be some inequality between us, yet will
I appear at the place of Battle, without other advantage then that of having
the right on my side. And whereas valor is the only good quality which is in
you, lose not the occasion which now I present you with to testify it.

ULAMA.


After this Challenge was finished, and that Vlama, to render the civility to
Ibrahim which he had used toward him, had showed it unto him, he gave it to a
Trumpet, who was to conduct a Boluchbassi, unto whom Ibrahim had committed the
Letter which he wrote to the Sophy; and having dismissed them with order
carefully to observe all that should be said to them, and all that they should
see, they parted instantly away, and the next day arrived at the Enemies Camp.
As soon as they were there, they were conducted to the Sophy's Tent, whom they
found environed with the most part of the Commanders of his Army. After that
the Boluchbassi had made a low obeisance to the Sophy, and told him from whom
he came, he presented him with Ibrahim's Letter, which the Sophy read softly
with some change of countenance; Then lifting up his voice after he had read it
over, I am too much obliged to Ibrahim, said he with both an obliging and
generous smile, for the care he tak^s to preserve my Subjects: Yes, yes,
continued he, addressing his speech to the Boluchbassi, I will accept of the
Battle, or to say better, I will go and present it to him; and within this hour
you shall carry him the news of it.

When as the Sophy had given over speaking, the Trumpet advanced, and after a
low obeisance also to him, Which of you, said he, turning himself to all them
that were about Tachmas, is called Deliment? It is I, answered Deliment,
severing himself from the rest: Why then, replied the Trumpet, I present you
here with a Challenge from Vlama. Vlama, cried the Sophy then: Y^s, my Lord,
said Deliment; and if your Majesty will give me leave, I will see that which he
has sent me. The Sophy having permitted him so to do, he opened the Challenge,
and read it aloud, but with so much choler when he came to the two last lines,
as he lost the respect which he owed to the Sophy with his insolency in
threatening Vlama; true indeed it is, that he knew well enough he should not
offend him thereby; for regarding Vlama as his Rival, all that he said against
him could not but please him. At length the Boluchbassi and the Trumpet having
been committed to the guard of those which had conducted them to the Sophy's
Tent, an hour after Tachmas and Deliment's Answer was brought unto them; and
having been conveyed out of the Camp, they returned to Ibrahim, whom they found
alone in his Tent with Vlama. They delivered him the Letter which was directed
to him, and to Vlama Deliment's Answer; and when as they had declared all that
they had observed in the Enemies Camp, they withdrew, and Ibrahim having opened
the Sophy's Letter, saw that it was thus.

SCACH TACHMAS, Great King of Persia, Universal Caliph of the Sect of Aly;
Chief of the Caselbas; Monarch of Parthia, Media, Assiria, and Armenia; the
beloved Son, and just Observer of the Laws of the Prophet Mahomet; Subduer of
Rebels; Expugnator of all the Tyrants of the Orient; Prince of the great City
of Smarcand; the lawful Successor of great Ismael; the invincible Sophy; the
greatest and most redoubted Lord of all the Seas and Lands of the Orient.
To the generous IBRAHIM.
THey which will fight never use long discourses; all that I can say to you for
answer is, that precisely within eight days I will attend you in the great
Plain of Nephates in the head of my Army ranged in Battle array; being
absolutely resolved, for the lessening of your disgrace if you be vanquished,
or for the augmenting of your glory if I be, to fight in person in this Battle;
and to be your Conqueror or your Captive: if it prove to be the last, death
shall soon set me at liberty; and if the other shall happen, be assured that
the esteem which I make of your virtue, of your fidelity to your Master, and of
your courage, shall make you receive more marks of my clemency and courtesy,
then I shall have rendered you of my valor in surmounting you.

TACHMAS.


Ibrahim, having found a great deal of generosity in this Letter, and being
exceeding joyful to see that the War would not last long, obliged Vlama to read
the Answer which Deliment made him.

DELIMENT's Answer to ULAMA's Challenge.
I Accept of the Combat with joy which you offer me; being glad that in the
view of two hundred thousand men the Princess Axiamira may learn by your
defeat, that he whom she terms her Enemy, and that will notwithstanding be
always her Lover, has more courage then he whom she has chosen for her
Protector. For in fine, I hope that right will not side so absolutely with a
rebellious Subject, as to keep the victory from being mine, and me from
punishing with my arm at one instant, both my particular enemy, and the enemy
of the State.

DELIMENT.


This injurious reproach vexed not Vlama so much, as the hope of being able to
punish Deliment gave him joy; so that Ibrahim and he being equally satisfied,
thought of nothing more then preparing themselves for the Battle. Tachmas and
Deliment on their parts, thought no less of it; and during these eight days,
both the Armies were in impatience for the arrival of this Battle, which was to
accumulate them with glory or confusion. And whereas the news of this
particular Combat was spread over all both Camps, a superstition crept in
amongst the Soldiers, which persuaded them that the event of this Combat would
be a presage of that of the Battle; so that each one on either side made vows
for the advantage of his party; but above all the rest Tachmas earnestly wished,
that Deliment might be victorious over Vlama; yet was it not so much for his
conservation and his glory, although he loved him infinitely, as for to have
the satisfaction of seeing Vlama dye, whom he beheld in this occasion, not as a
revolted Subject, but as the Lover of Felixana, and his Rival; and it might be
said, that he had rather Deliment should vanquish him, on condition that he
lost the Battle, then that he should win it without the loss of Vlama: Out of
this thought also was it that he permitted the Combat to Deliment. At length
the sixth day being come, both the two Armies marched to the Plain of Niphates,
and encamped in the sight of one another, to the end that reposing themselves
one whole day they might fight with the more courage. Never was there a
goodlier or gallanter thing seen then these two Camps; nor Peace with all its
abundance, what public feasts soever it has caused, ever showed more state,
th^n War did at that time in these two Armies. For Soliman out of a particular
grace was pleased that Ibrahim should march with the same pomp in this voyage,
as if he had been there in person; that the Officers, which are not accustomed
to serve in it, but when he is there, should accompany him; that those Ensigns,
which are never displayed but in his presence, should be set up; that the
Spachis, who fight not but before him, should be present there; and that the
same pavillions, which he himself used, should be his. And whereas the custom
of the Turks and Persians is to lodge all the Soldiers in Tents, and that
ordinarily they are all very sumptuous, these two Camps showed the goodliest
object that can fall under the eye of man. There was nothing but Cloth of Gold
and Tinsel in all Ibrahim's Pavillions, with Silver Cressents, Penons, and
Streamers on the top of them. The least Tents were painted on the outside with
Arabesque foliage of Gold and Silver, intermixed with different colors; and
those of the very Slaves were of Cotton Cloth of lively colors, and woven
Checquerwise. Ibrahim in the evening, out of a warlike gallantry, sent to tell
the Sophy that he was arrived, and desired to receive his pleasure: whereunto
Tachmas answered, that the next morning at Sunrising he should see him in the
head of his Army. At last this so long expected day being come, scarcely had
the first beams of the Sun begun to gild the tops of those four high mountains
which environ this Plain, but Ibrahim, as well as Tachmas, drawing his Army out
of their Trenches, put it into Battle array; and whereas he followed the order
of the Turks in the greatest part of exterior things, he ranged his Troops into
the form of a Cressent, but with this difference nevertheless, that contrary to
the custom of their Generals of Armies, he would be the foremost; and for that
effect he placed himself between the right horn and the left, in the head of a
Battalian of six thousand Janissaries. He gave the Command of the left to the
Beglierbey of Amasia, and of the right to the Bassa Pialli. He caused part of
his Ordnance to be set in the midst; and to surprise the Enemy the more, the
rest was placed between two Battalions of Foot. He chose four thousand also
from out of his Horse to ride up and down about the Camp for the succoring of
those that were in need. He placed his best Troops in the head and body of the
Battle, leaving the rear-ward to the conduct of the Sangiac of Morea. And
whereas the Persians have more Horse then Foot, he so well disposed of his,
that on what side soever they were assaulted, his Squadrons might make head on
all parts. Order being given then every where, and Ibrahim having gone more
then once from Battalion to Battalion, and from rank to rank, to see that every
one performed his duty, he began at length to speak to his Troops much after
this sort.

IBRAHIM's Oration to his Soldiers.
FEllow Soldiers, It is rather to follow the custom then for necessity that I
come thus to speak to you, seeing sufficiently by your faces that you are
resolved to do well; and that you have not forgotten how these enemies, which
we are going to fight withal, are the very same whom we have heretofore
vanquished; so that without standing on vain discourses, remember only, that
all the design I have in this battle is to vanquish or to dye; that flying is
oftentimes more deadly then fighting; and that a noble death is to be preferred
before an ignominious life. Let us go then, Fellow Soldiers, to seek out the
Victory which is attending to crown us. In fine, I demand but one thing of you,
which is, that you will not lose the sight of me, and to go only so far as I
will lead you.


Ibrahim, having made an end of speaking, and his Soldiers having assured him
that they would follow him, by a joyful shout which they gave all together,
alighted from his horse, and went and put himself in the head of six thousand
Janissaries, whom he had placed between the left horn and the right. And whereas
this action made all them that saw it give a great shout: You see, said he,
Fellow Soldiers, that I have no intent to abandon you, since I d^prive my self
of the means to fly. After this he commanded to march on; and that great body,
composed of so many different parts, began to advance with so regular a motion,
as it might be said, that one spirit made it move.

In the mean time Tachmas, who knew the manner of the Turks fight, had ranged
his Army in battle array much after the same sort, with this difference
nevertheless, that whereas he had more Horse then Foot, behind the battalion
which corresponded to that of the Janissaries, in the head of whom Ibrahim had
set himself, was a squadron of the most courageous Nobility of all his Empire,
in the midst of whom he was. And when as he saw that his Enemies Army moved, he
caused his to set forward, so that these two great bodies advancing equally
came within five hundred paces one of another; and by the manner of their
marching, it had been a very difficult matter to discern to which side the
victory would lead.

When as they were at this distance, Vlama, after he had obtained permission of
Ibrahim for it, severed himself from the Army, and went directly toward the
Enemies with his Scym^tar in his hand; but scarcely was he advanced fifteen
paces, when as Deliment, having also severed himself from his party, came and
encountered him in the same sort; and these two brave Cavaliers joined together
just in the middle of the place of battle. The two Armies made a stand to see
this combat, which was beheld by both parts almost as an infallible prefage of
the victory to that side of them two which should carry it from the other. As
soon as Vlama and Deliment were met, they fell to fighting, either of them
having too great a heart for to stand reproaching and reviling one another. At
first, Deliment fought like a desperate man, and Vlama like one, who without
losing his judgment, or otherwise transported, made it nevertheless
sufficiently appear by the manner of his carriage, that he was resolved either
to vanquish or to dye. Signs of fury were seen in the one, and proofs of an
invincible courage in the other; the first struck with violence, and
inconsiderately; and the last, exposing himself valiantly some times to his
Enemies blows, assaulted him with judgment, and warded with address: But at
length after they had made an hundred passades to no purpose, had tried in vain
to gain the crupper, and had been a long time without hurting one another;
Vlama seeming to be vexed for staying so long from vanquishing or dying,
redoubled his endevors, and pressing his Enemy more vively then before, he had
at length the satisfaction to see his blood first, with a blow of his Scymitar,
which he laid at his shoulder but lighted on his thigh. This first advantage
more augmented Vlama's courage, and redoubled Deliment's rage; for after that
it was impossible to discern the blows they gave each another: Deliment was in
continual action, Vlama, no more then he, lost not a minutes time; and without
eithers recoyling, or taking breath, they fought very near an hour, and yet it
could not be judged to which side the victory inclined. Vlama's Turbant was all
in pieces, he had also received a wound on his left arm, his Scymitar was dyed
with the blood of Deliment, whom he had hurt in two places, when as in an
instant flying violently at him, he discharged so great a blow with his
Scymitar on his neck, that falling from his horse, he extended him dead at his
feet. This fall made all those of Vlama's party to shout for joy, but he
without longer tarrying in that pl^ce, galloped back to Ibrahim, and with as
much tranquillity of spirit, as if he had not fought at all, said to him
smiling, that he came from rough-hewing the victory for him. If I obtain it,
replied the illustrious Bassa, it will be less glorious to me, then that which
you have gotten, since you share it with none, whereas I shall owe the other,
both to your valor, and to that of an hundred thousand men that follow me.

After this, Ibrahim, having observed that Vlama was wounded on the left arm by
the blood which came out of it, would not have had him fought; but Vlama not
consenting thereunto, only caused his arm to be bound up with a piece of
linen cloth of a Turbant; and placing himself by Ibrahim, and all the
Trumpets, Drums, and Attaballes having sounded a charge, they began to march
with those great cries, which all the Oriental Nations make at the beginning of
battles; but yet with this difference, that Ibrahim's Soldiers seemed to be
almost assured of the victory, whereas the others on the contrary seemed to
have no other design in fighting, then to revenge the death of Deliment: It was
not for that he was beloved, but because the Sophy showed so much resentment
for it, as it pass^d even into the hearts of his men. In the end these two
Armies being provoked, the one by the desire of glory, and the other by that of
revenge, they encountered together. And to give yet a further courage to
Ibrahim's forces, it happened that Tachmas, being arrived first in the field,
had seized on an high piece of ground, upon the which he had planted his
Ordnance; but that which he conceived would have been advantageous, proved
unprofitable unto him; for when as the two Armies caused their Cannon to play
on either part, that of the Persians did no hurt to the Turks, because all the
shot passed over their heads in regard it was planted too high. Ibrahim's
Ordnance wrought another effect, and his first discharge lighting just in the
midst of that Sq^adron, where the Sophy was in person, cleared all the ranks,
with the slaughter of a world of men. But when as the Sophy, who lost not his
judgment in this occasion, had commanded those behind to take the place of
them before, Ibrahim on his side, caused two battalions, behind the which were
the rest of his Ordnance, to open, and the Soldiers having accord^ngly divided
themselves to the right hand and to the left, the remainder of his Ordnance
discharged all together through the void space that was between the ranks, and
put his Enemies into so strange a disorder, as the like was never heard of. And
truly it was advantageous to the Persians, that the thickness of the smoke and
dust, which enveloped these two Armies, kept them from seeing the horridness of
this execution, for otherwise peradventure they would not have had so much
heart to fight, as they testified afterward.

At length, Tachmas having formed his battalions anew, for repairing of the
disorder which the great Ordnance had made, and Ibrahim's Soldiers having
reassumed their stations, these two Armies came to cope with one another.
Ibrahim, followed by Vlama, gave first into the battalion, behind the which
was that broken squadron, where the Sophy and Ismael were in person. And it was
there, where out of a prodigious valor he did things, which would not find
belief with posterity, if they were written. He made way through all
opposition, and not contented with carrying fear and terror wheresoever he
went; with defending his own life, and giving death to his Enemies; but took
care also for the conservation of his own party. He saved the Bassa Sinan from
being killed, by discharging a great blow with his Scymitar upon him that was
striking him: now though he performed the Soldier in this encounter, yet left
he not for all that to behave himself like the General of the Army, and to have
an eye to all things. Sometimes he sent to succor those that stood in need;
sometimes he went to them in person, and joining both prudence and valor
together, it might be said, that never two several men exercised them so nobly,
as Ibrahim in his person alone made them to appear in this occasion. And the
course that he held was such, in sending his directions to every part, as it
might also be affi^med, that he was in all the fights that were in the field,
and that he might with reason be termed the soul of his Army. Vlama in like
manner worthily seconded his valor; and all the Janissaries, seeing in the head
of them so courageous a Chieftain, performed their parts so well in this
encounter, that they pierced quite through this battalion, and so absolutely
defeated it, as all that the squadron which was behind it could do, was to set
the person of Tachmas out of danger.

But whilst Ibrahim fought so prosperously, the Beglierbey of Amasia, who
commanded the left wing, had not the like fortune; for finding himself opposed
to the best Soldiers of the Enemies Army, who were commanded by one Basingir, a
man of great consideration with the Persians, his battalion had been broken at
the very first, and the Enemies intermingling amongst them, had killed part of
them, and made the rest to fly, in beating them even to the body of their
battle. Ibrahim, having been advertised of this disorder, left Vlama to
prosecute the victory, which he was already well entered into, and mounting on a
horse, he went galloping, followed only by an hundred Accangis, whom he drew
from their body, toward the place where the greatest disorder was. When he
arrived there, and saw his men basely flying, and suffering themselves to be
killed, scarcely making defense, he went directly to them with his Scymitar in
his hand; but being loath to cover them with shame, in l^tting them see that he
perc^ived their cowardice: You mistake, said he, Fellow Soldiers, your valor
transports you too much, the Enemy is not that way, turn about, and follow me.
This speech filled them with confusion, and this confusion having redoubled
their courage they rallyed themselves about him. But when as notwithstanding he
saw that those words were not sufficient to make them fight valiantly enough,
he went to one of those who carried the Arms of the Empire, and taking the
Ensign out of his hand, he threw it with all his force into the midst of the
Enemies, and turning about to his men; Come, Fellow Soldiers, said he unto
them, we must dye, or recover it. This action gave new strength to the Turks;
for whereas amongst them the greatest disgrace that can arrive to their Troops,
is to let the Enemies with whom they fight take the Arms of the Empire: the
design of recovering this Ensign, which Ibrahim had thrown amongst the Enemies,
infused the desire of glory, and fear of infamy into their souls. At length the
one side purposing to keep it, and the other to regain it, there began so
fierce a sight betwixt them, as it was in this place where the greatest
slaughter was made. Wounds, in stead of weakening those which received them,
seemed to incense their fury. There were men seen covered all over with blood
and hurts, who in falling down dead gave death unto others. They too who had
already lost their lives, served still to make others lose th^irs; for diverse
encountering with this great number of bodies under their feet, stumbled many
tim^s against their wills, and so gave their Enemies the opportunity to run
them through; and of all this infinite company of men that fought in this
place, there was not one which was not dyed, either with his own blood, or that
of his Enemies. But at last after a very long conflict, the very same hand
which had thrown the Turks Ensign to the Persians, wrung it out of the hand of
Basingir, who had seized upon it, by depriving him of his life; and he not
only recovered his own Standart, but he also gained that of the Enemies. This
so noble and brave an action abated the courage of the Persians, and augmented
that of the Turks, so that after this, those which had sled in their turn
pursued the very sam^ adversaries, who had routed them; and Ibrahim went
beating them to the very place where he had left Vlama; who on h^s side had
almost made an end of vanquishing all that had mad^ resistance against him.
Howbeit he remembered in this occasion that he was Tachmas subject, for having
found Ismael enclosed by five or six Turks, who seeing that he would neither
defend, nor render himself, would without doubt have killed him, he drew him
out of their hands, and repr^aching them for standing in that sort upon the
getting of so weak a victory, having so many Enemies yet to fight withal, he
gave him the opportunity to escape to his own party.

In ^he mean time the Bassa Pialli, who commanded the left wing, was still
bickering with one, named Alamut, who commanded the Persians left wing; and
they had fought with so equal an advan^age, as it could not be said to which
side the victory leaned. But the Grand Vizier being her favorite in this
battle, she followed him also in this occasion. His arrival made the face of
things to change; the Persian Horse basely fell off, and a battalion of Foot
was wholly overthrown: the Accangis in this encounter did wonders, the Timariots
likewise performed their duty, and albeit the Persian Cavalry is better then
the Turks, yet this day they proved the weaker.

The Sophy seeing his whole battle broken, a great part of his men dead, and
fear in all the rest, thought no longer but of making a retreat, and putting
his person in safety, that he might not fall into the power of his Enemies; and
to facilitate the means thereof, he commanded six thousand Horse, which were
coasting the Army, to set upon Ibrahim's Reer-guard, who had not yet fought;
thinking thereby to make a diversion, and give him the means to retire with
some order, things being no longer in terms for him to hope that he could keep
the field. But this design succeed^d no better then the rest; for these six
thousand Horse having encountered those, which Ibrahim had commanded to ride up
and down about his Camp, there f^ll out a particular fight betwixt them,
wherein the Persians were also vanquished: So that Tachmas, missing of this
hope too, thought no longer of retreating, but of flying. And whereas of all
apprehensions fear is that which more speedily passes from one heart to
another amongst the Soldi^rs, the Sophy was no sooner seen to think of
retiring, but his Troops were straightway possessed with terror: The Enemy
appeared more redoubtable to them then before, and losing the hope of victory,
they lost the will to fight.

Ibrahim in the mean while omitted no time; and perceiving by the Enemies
countenance, that they were no longer carried by the desire of vanquishing, but
only by that of saving themselves, he redoubled his endevors, and causing all
the Troops of his Army, which had not yet fought, to fall on all together, he
put that of the Enemies into so fearful a disorder, that it was no longer
either figh^ing, retreating, or flying, but to say better, it was all the three
together. For in one place, a battalion was seen to stand firm, and continue
fighting; in another a Squadron that retired without breaking; but almost every
where the Horse and Foot were seen mingled together; the Soldiers abandoning
their Colors, and throwing away their Arms; some yielding themselves to their
Enemies; others killing Horsemen, that they might have their Horses to fly
away with the more speed and safety; the Cannon left without defense; the
baggage exposed to plunder; all the Commanders without any power over their
Soldiers; the most of them not knowing themselves what they would command; in
the end, if the night had not arrived, I believe that not one of the Persians
had been in an estate to fight, and that Tachmas would have fallen into the
power of Ibrahim; but darkness coming on stole him from his victory: For
Tachmas, having rallyed all the Nobless about him that he had left, commanded
four Thousand Horse, and two Thousand Foot, to go and amuse the Enemy, whilst
he retired. And these Troops were they alone, which showed in the conclusion of
this battle, that they merited not their misfortune; for at length, by the
resistance which they made, though it was not long, they gave Tachmas
opportunity to retire into Sultania.

In the mean time Ibrahim, to keep the victory from destroying his Army, after
that he and Vlama had pursued those which sled, as far as daylight would
permit them to distinguish between the Enemies and their own men, forbad his
Soldiers from plundering the Persian Camp, promising to give them the whole
booty of it; and causing every one to repair to his Colors, he passed the
night in the place of battle; absolutely victorious, without being wounded, or
losing above two thousand men; where after the slaughter of twenty thousand
Enemies, of taking their baggage, their Cannon, and their Colors, he might
without fear, and in safety, have remained in the field of his triumph, without
thinking of any thing but of enjoying his victory: Yet did not he so, for after
he had commanded that Vlama should be dressed, who was slightly hurt, he went
himself to place the Guards, to see if all things were as they should be, and
to visit such of the Commanders as were wounded. But in the end, after he was
returned to his dear Vlama, and had refl^cted a while on himself, he in his
heart offered his whole victory to Isabella, as believing it to be rather an
effect of her vows, then of his valor. And the thought which he had that this
happy day might make him obtain her liberty, was the only pleasure that this
famous victory gave him, and the recompense of all his travels.

The End of the Third Book.
The Fourth Book.
Whereas it is not enough to have vanquished, if one does not know how to use
the victory, the Illustrious Bassa knew too well how to make use of the
advantages of fortune, for to neglect his enemy after he had surmounted him. He
was not ignorant that the chance of war is inconstant; that Conquerors may
oftentimes be Slaves to those whom they have put in chains; and that the Crowns
which Victory has set on the head of those whom she favors, are not so well
settled, but that they may be plucked from thence. Out of so just a reasoning,
Ibrahim took as much care to have good order observed in his Army, as if that
of Tachmas had been still in the field, and had not been defeated. He discamped
then the next day, and still advancing into the Enemies Country, without
incountring any obstacle, he carried terror over all the Persian Empire. For
whereas the Sophie; Army had been utterly routed, they which had not followed
him to Sultania, and that had escaped killing in the battle, fled to the next
adjoining Provinces, and by their report wrought that in the minds of those
that heard them, which the Arms of Ibrahim had wrought in them, possessing
their hearts with fear and terror. And whereas it is natural enough for a man
to seek to excuse himself, they made the Army of the Turks far greater than it
was, for the justifying of their flight; they commended the valor of Ibrahim
to cover their own cowardice, and fighting for him in this occasion, they
induced many Towns to render themselves, who otherwise had at leastwise
attended the Canon, and the fight of their Enemy. But whereas the most part of
the Palaces in this Empire are not much fortified, and are commonly his that
keeps the field, Ibrahim being become so absolutely Master of it, as there was
not an enemy appearing, he had no other employment after the battle of
Niphates, than to receive the Deputies of Towns which came to bring him the
keys thereof; and one would have said, considering in what manner things past,
that Ibrahim was rather a lawful King, that rode in progress about his Kingdom
to make himself known to his Subjects, than a Conqueror, which received the
submissions of the people whom he had subdued. In fine, the matter went in that
sort, as in two months space the Grand Vizier restored unto Solimans obedience
all the places which he had formerly conquered, and that had revolted after
Ulamaes defeat, and during the time of his sickness. In the mean while he had
sent to Prince Mahamed and to Axiamira, to assure them that he did not conquer
their Country but only to oblige the Sophy to demand peace; and if it should
be long before he heard from him, he would send to propound it unto him, with
such just conditions, as he could not refuse it. Ulama likewise on his part had
written to the Princess and Felixana, who had not failed to testify unto him
by their Letters a great deal of acknowledgement for the victory which he had
obtained of Deliment. Axiamira was nevertheless much disquieted, to understand
by all them which came from the Camp to Bitilisa, that since Tachmas entered
into Sultania, there had been no news of him: For albeit the Sophy had
entreated her very ill, yet still he was her Father, and the apprehensions of
Nature were yet stronger in her heart, than the remembrance of injuries was
sensible unto her. This unquietness was not particular to her, and though it
was after a different fashion, yet certain it is, that the Grand Vizier was
troubled, for that he could learn nothing of Tachmas; not being able to imagine
what design he should have in shutting himself up in Sultania, and never
appearing since, nor giving any order for setting some forces on foot again.
One morning as he was talking with Ulama about it, and that neither of them
knew what to think of it, one came and told him, that one named Morath, Captain
of a Galley of the Bassa of the Seas Fleet, desired to speak with him. Ibrahim,
who knew the order which this Bassa had had to make some descent into
Mingrelia, thereby to divert the enemies forces, believed that he came to give
him an account thereof, and therefore commanded him to be brought in: Which was
no sooner done, but Morath, after he had saluted him with an high respect, told
him, that having been acquainted by fame with the prosperous success of his
Arms, and that he was in a condition to impose Laws on the vanquished, he was
sent from the Bassa of the Sea to beg a grace of him in favor of Arsalon. This
name equally surprised both Ibrahim and Ulama; for the Grand Vizier remembered
very well that this Arsalon was he who had taken Doria near to Naples; that he
was Father to Alibech, whom Osman the Bassa of the Seas son had married; but he
could not comprehend how they should meet together, and be made friends: Ulama
knew too, by report, that the Satrap Arsalon was become the famousest Pirate of
all the Seas of the Levant; so that both of them provoked by curiosity, pressed
Morath to explain himself more clearly. My Lord, said he to Ibrahim, before I
tell you what Arsalon desires, may you be pleased to let me relate unto you the
sequel of an History, the beginning whereof you are acquainted with, to the
end that by the knowledge you shall have thereof, you may be the more easilier
carried to grant the favor which is desired of your generosity. Ibrahim having
consented thereunto, caused every one to go out of his Tent, except Ulama, and
they two being set, Morath spoke in this sort.

The Sequel of the History of Osman and Alibech.
I Make no doubt, my Lord, but if the generosity of Alibech moved you at such
time, as by your goodness you got the Grand Signior to judge her cause to her
advantage, I make no doubt, I say, but that which I am going to impart unto you
will carry you to serve her. I will not stand to run over her first adventures,
thereby to make you understand the rest, since I hold it impossible that you
should not still remember, that she is the daughter of Arsalon the Pirate, or
to say better, of a Satrap of Persia, whom ill fortune has made a Pirate. And
I do not think you have forgot that this Pirate took Osman prisoner, who in a
few days became desperately in love with the virtuous Alibech, and that she
delivering him, saved her self with him, upon condition that he should marry
her when he came to Constantinople: No more can you be ignorant that the Bassa
of the Sea would never have permitted his son to have kept his word with her,
had not the Grand Signior by his commandment, and by his liberality, forced him
to receive this fair Maid, in whom he found no other defect but poverty. Now
since that, my Lord, I can assure you, that Alibech has not rendered her self
unworthy of the grace you did her, nor of that which yet she attends from your
goodness. She has lived with the Bassa of the Sea in as much obedience to him,
as if she had been his own daughter; and with her submissions and respects has
in such sort acquired his affection, as he loves not his son with more
tenderness. As for Osman, there has never been heard speak of a more violent,
or more durable love than his, and every day too he sees some new grace in his
dear Alibech; for whereas the beauty of her soul is far greater than that of
her face, she has given him so many new marks of her virtue, of her courage,
of her love, and of her generosity, as he should be the ingratefullest of men,
if the affection which he bears her, could enter into comparison with any
other. This person then, being so straightly linked in good will to her
Father-in-Law, and to her husband, could not resolve to abandon them, at such
time as the Bassa of the Sea was constrained to imbark himself for to go and
command the Fleet, which was sent into Mingrelia. And although, out of the fear
they were in lest she should receive some incommoditie, they did all they could
to keep her from it, yet was it impossible for them to prevail with her. No,
no, said she to Osman, I cannot leave you; and seeing I could follow a father
out of obedience, I can better follow an husband out of affection. I am already
inured to the discommodities of the Sea, which no doubt will be sweeter to me,
sharing them with you, than rest would be agreeable unto me, if I should enjoy
it without you. If you fight with advantage, added she, the joy which I shall
have of your victory will redouble yours; and if by misfortune you be
vanquished, which Heaven forsend, my tears shall fight for you, when you no
longer can. In fine, said she further, tempests, war, slavery, yea and death it
self, would be sweeter to me, than a long absence. Alibech having in this sort
touched the heart of Osman, and the Bassa of the Sea being overcome by her
entreaties, she imbarqued her self with her husband, who was Vice Admiral
under his Father. Their Navigation having been prosperous enough, until they
came to Mingrelia, they thought of no hing more than of choosing a place where
they might make a descent, according to the order they had for it: but a
horrible tempest that arose, destroyed all their designs. It was so great, so
long, and so extraordinary, that the whole Fleet was dispersed; so that when it
grew to be calm again, three Vessels were scarce found together: Howbeit so
great was our good fortune, as in four or five days the whole Navy rejoyned,
and albeit most of the ships had something, or other broken, yet we rejoiced to
see them all shattered as they were, after we had believed they were lost. The
two Vessels of Osman, and of the Bassa of the Sea, were only wanting to the
Fleet; but at length that of Osman coming in, made us hope that the Bassa
would return in like manner. After he had been attended some days with an
impatience, which well demonstrated the love which Osman, and the generosity
which Alibech had for him; and after that many Vessels had been sen^ out to
cross up and down the Sea, for to try if they could meet with him, one day as
Osman was looking forth himself to see if he could descry any thing, he
discovered a Vessel: and though it was so far off as he could not discern of
what Nation she was, yet the extreme desire which he had that it might be his
fathers, persuaded him that it was he. In this belief he caused his dear
Alibech to come upon the deck to let her see that which all the rest of his
Vessel saw as well as he; they continued a pretty while in this sort, between
hope and fear, but at length this Vessel approaching by little and little,
destroyed the first, and increased the other; for Osman certainly knew that
this Vessel was a Brigantine, and not that of his father, whose fortune had
been very different from his. The tempest having severed him from his Fleet,
and the storm having mightily bruised his Vessel, he had been so unhappy as to
encounter with a Pirate; who having found him in so deplorable an estate, had
set upon him, or to say better, had taken him, he not being able to make any
resistance. The Bassa of the Sea after this misfortune, was persuaded, that to
be the more gently used, and to get the sooner out of his enemies hands, he was
to tell who he was, to the end that offering a great ransom he might be
restored to his liberty; the rather, for that in this occasion the affairs of
the Empire being much concerned, he should have committed a crime, if he had
concealed his name for the saving of money. But that which he thought would
conduce most to the getting himself out of trouble, gave him the more; for be
pleased to know, that by an encounter altogether prodigious, he that had taken
him was the Pirate Arsalon, father to the virtuous Alibech; who no sooner
understood that this prisoner was the Bassa of the Sea, but he appeared to be
mightily incensed with anger. What, said he unto him, are you the father then
of the Traitor Osman, or to say better, of the Ravisher of my daughter? and
has fortune, who has always persecuted me so cruelly, at last furnished me
with means to be revenged? Speak, said he unto him, but disguise not the truth,
lest I be drawn to make you tell it by force. The Bassa of the Sea surprised
with this discourse, and perceiving very well that this Pirate was Arsalon,
thought nevertheless, since he had said so much already, that the best would be
not to dissemble, and to endeavor by the assurance which he would give him
that Alibech was Osmans wife, and that he had always used her as if she had
been his own daughter, to induce him to use him also with the more humanity. In
this resolution, I acknowledge, said he unto him, that I am the Bassa of the
Sea, that I am the father of Osman, and the father of the ravisher of Alibech;
but withal, you are to acknowledge to me also, that I am the father of your
daughter, seeing she has married my son; and you are consequently to confess,
that since love alone has been the cause of their fault, you ought to pardon
them for it; if so be you have not lost the remembrance, that the very same
passion made you in times past forget all things. I have not lost the
remembrance of it, replied Arsalon, but I remember the punishment too that was
inflicted on me; and if I treat my daughter after the same manner, she will
have no just occasion to complain. If you knew, answered the Bassa of the sea,
what the affection of Osman and Alibech were, it would touch your heart: It is
so great, continued he, that in the voyage, which I have so unhappily
undertaken, she would by no means abandon her husband. Arsalon hearing this
discourse, made him explane it more particularly unto him; and knew that his
daughter was not very far from him: Whereat he testified a great deal of joy,
and beholding the Bassa with a smile full of bitterness; to show you, said he
unto him, that I am generous, and that I will not confound the innocent with
the guilty; I will not use you ill; nay I will not require son, though as my
slave I might do it; but I will only have that which appertains to me, that is
to say, the ungrateful and unnatural Alibech. I do you a good office, said he
unto him, raising his voice; for since she could betray her father, and abandon
him, she would quit you no doubt, and betray you as well as me. The Bassa,
surprised with this discourse and demand, stood a while without answering
thereunto; nevertheless, whereas he is generous, and that the virtue of Alibech
has won his heart, he could by no means agree to what was required of him. No,
said he to Arsalon, I will never be ungrateful to your daughter; she restored
my son to his liberty, and I will lose mine to preserve her that which she
enjoyes. And then again; said he unto him, I am not master of her, she is
Osmans, who commanding the Navy in my absence, is in an estate to refuse her
unto me, if I should be so base as to demand her, which I will never do. We
shall see, said Arsalon then to him, whether you will not change your mind; and
after they had disputed yet a while, he commanded him to be laden with chains,
and told him once again, that he should never have his liberty, and that every
day he would make him try new torments, if he did not write to his son to
oblige him to deliver Alibech into the hands of those whom he would send to him
for that purpose; promising him, that she should be no sooner in his power, but
he would restore him to his liberty. The Bassa in so cross a conjuncture, knew
not what to think, or what to resolve on. He knew by the report of his son,
and of Alibech too, that Arsalon was firm in his resolutions, and of a severe
and cruel inclination. He knew that his absence would prejudice the affairs of
the Empire; yea and he was persuaded, that his son, loving Alibech more than
his life, would never resolve to lose her for the saving of him; he felt a
strange repugnancy in his heart too against the making of this request unto
him; and not knowing what to do in so deplorable a case, he lamented his
misfortune, accused Arsalons cruelty, and without framing any design, endured
the sharpest grief that any soul can be capable of. In the mean time Arsalon,
fearing lest the Bassa of the Seas Fleet should remove further from him, and
that then he should not have Alibech so easily, pressed him to take his last
resolution: but what threatenings soever he could use unto him, he could not
possibly draw him to write to Osman to oblige him to give Alibech for his
ransom. Arsalon did all that he could to shake his resolution; he assured him
of a perpetual slavery; he made him see that his death was indubitable; and
perceiving at last that he no whit prevailed, he chose out one of the most
understanding and resolutest men of his company, and giving him a Brigantine,
he sent him toward a Cape, where he had learnt the Fleet was reassembled; and
having told him he would stay for him at a creek which was not far from thence,
he willed him to search so diligently, that he might find out the Bassa of the
Seas Navy; and having found it, that he should deliver to Osman his son, who
commanded in his absence, the message which he would impart unto him; whereupon
rowning him softly in the ear, he instructed him with his intentions, and
dispatched him instantly away. This man, who was a Persian by Nation, exactly
obeyed him, and was so fortunate, as he sailed directly to the place where the
Bassa of the Seas Fleet were all joined together again. And it was, my Lord,
the very same vessel which Osman discovered at sea, which a far off gave him
so much hope, and which approaching so mightily redoubled his grief, to see
that it was a Brigantine, that the spite to be so deceived, made him resolve
to fight with her: For which effect he commanded two of his vessels to attacque
her; but the Persian who had no design to endanger himself to no purpose,
perceiving the intention of them that were making toward him, struck sail,
hung out a flag of truce, and putting himself into the skiff, with three of his
companions, to testify the more confidence, he went in this sort to encounter
those which were advanced toward him. When he was so near them as he might be
heard, the Persian, to have audience the sooner, required to speak with Osman
from the Bassa of the Sea his father. This name made them all to shout for joy
tha^ heard it; and the word passing strait from Vessel to Vessel, and from
Gally to Gally, the^e was a general rejoicing over all the whole Fleet. In the
mean time Osman having been advertised of it, attended with as much joy as
impatience, him, that brought him news of his father. And whereas he shared all
his bad, and all his hood haps with his dear wife, she was with him at such
time as the Persian was conducted unto him. The sight of this man made the
virtuous Alibech change color, for she presently knew him, as having seen him
with her father, all the time that she lived at sea. This first motion was
quickly seconded with an extreme grief; for when as Osman, out of an impatience
derived from his affection, had demanded of this man where his father was; My
Lord, said he unto him, with a great deal of boldness, he is in a place from
whence you may easily draw him, and to clear the matter unto you, know, that
the chance of War, or rather the equity of Heaven, has made him fall into the
power of the invincible Arsalon. Alas, said Alibech, looking on Osman, what
have I heard! and what a destiny is ours like to be! What, said Osman,
interrupting her, and all amazed, is my father in the hands of Arsalon? Yes, my
Lord, replied the Persian, and it is from him that I come to tell you, that you
shall never see the Bassa your father more, if you do not render him his
daughter: This is the price he has set for his liberty, and it is that which
you ought to pay him. I know that I speak boldly, and that in some sort I
endanger my self; but be-think you that you have a person in the power of
Arsalon, which ought to keep you from entreating me ill. I leave you to judge,
generous Ibrahim, what this proposition effected in the minds of Osman and
Alibech, and what a combat that was, where one must resolve to abandon a
father, or lose a wife; yea a wife, to whom Osman owed his life and liberty:
which made up all his felicity; and which was both his wife and his mistress.
Nature and Love could not be satisfied in this occasion: Osman could not be
acknowledging without being ungrateful; and finding cruelty in both the
parties, he knew not what resolution to take. Osman never reasoned at first for
all that on this adventure, but without sticking a whit at it, he told him that
had spoken to him, how he could not render his wife, neither could he abandon
his father, but he kn^w well enough how to destroy Arsalon. Ah, my Lord, cried
Alibech then, who had done nothing as yet but weep, being scarce able to form a
word; If the Bassa of the sea is your father, Arsalon is mine; and you cannot
hurt him without wronging me. Osman being come again out of this first
transport, and ravished with Alibeches generosity, craved pardon of her: and
this Persian returning to speak, I know, my Lord, said he unto him, that this
choice is hard to be made, wherefore permit me to go back to my vessel, and
let me within a day have your answer; but consult with your reason, remember
that Alibech is the daughter of him that demands her, and that the Bassa of the
Sea is the father of a man that stole her away. If Osman had followed his first
thoughts, he had caused this man to be thrown into the Sea, but fearing lest
such violence should prejudice his father, he chose ^ather to grant his demand.
When he was gone away, and that without other witnesses than his dear Alibech
he might let his grief break forth; Do not think, said he unto her, that I
consult whether I should deliver you into the hands of Arsalon; no, that is not
my thought; but I am considering which way I may deliver my Father: For in
fine, it is equally impossible for me to resolve to love him, and abandon you.
I ow my life to both of you; I ow obedience to my Father, and love to Alibech:
If my death could satisfy you both, I should dye no doubt with joy; but
fortune that delights to pick me out extraordinary miseries, will not let any
thing be able to succor me. The more I consider the matter, the less remedy do
I find for it; which way soever I look upon it, I am still guilty, and still
unhappy. I cannot break my fathers chains without giving them to you; I cannot
end his punishment, but in beginning yours; I cannot restore him his liberty,
but in depriving you of it, nor can save his life, but in putting yours in
jeopardy; and that is it which is absolutely impossible for me to do. But,
added he, if I conserve you, I load my father with irons; I my self fasten the
shackles wherewith he is bound; I am the cause of his captivity, and it may be
of his death; I am a parricide, and I stab a dagger into the heart of him that
gave me life. See generous Alibech, said he unto her, what the choice is which
I can make in so cross an adventure. My Lord, said she unto him, wholly
dissolved into tears, you require a counsel of me which is very hard to be
given; it is not because I fear the rigor of my father so much, as I cannot
resolve without pain to endure it to deliver yours; but, my Lord, it is because
I cannot do it without abandoning you. Yet I must, continued she; for whereas I
am the daughter of Arsalon, it is for me to receive the chastisement of her
fault; and whereas I am in part the cause of his captivity, it is for me also
to deliver him; and it is for me also to dry up the tears which you shed for
him: Suffer me then to go and undo his chains, and wear his irons. Ah! too
generous Alibech, answered Osman, do not offer me a remedy worse than the
disease, and which I cannot accept of: My father is too generous too, continued
he, to endure it; and he would disavow me for his son, if I were capable of
such a baseness. To have such thoughts would be a thing worthy of his great
heart, replied Alibech, but it would also be a thing unworthy both of you, and
of me, if I could suffer you to be cruel to the Bassa your father, and that he
should lose his life by my means. No, Osman, it is that which I can never
endure; and since we cannot live happy together, let us at leastwise die
innocent. Do what you ought for your father; owing him your life, you ow him
all things; sacrifise your wife to deliver him, it is just, and she desires it.
I must, added she, for the love of you, deprive my self of you; and fear not
that I will accuse you of want of affection, whenas you shall consent
thereunto; no, Osman, I should not be glad that your love to me should stifle
the motions of nature in you. Reason must be stronger than all other things;
and he that could abandon his father, might also in some other occasion abandon
his wife. Permit me to do what I ought, and leave the rest to the conduct of
fortune. That would not be just, answered Osman. What will you do then, replied
Alibech? I do not know, answered he; only I know that the estate wherein my
soul is, I can neither be wanting to my father, nor to you; and yet being
unable to save you both, I see that nothing but death can succor me. After
this, Osman fell a musing, then suddenly coming to himself again, he seemed to
take the resolution to go and seek out Arsalon for to fight with him. But
Alibech having apprehended his design, What, my Lord, said she unto him,
casting her self at his feet, could you command your men to shoot at a Vessel
where your father or mine might be killed, and it may be both of them? Could
that so generous heart of yours permit you to dip your hands in my blood or in
yours? Think well, my Lord, of that which you say; and know that I am capable
of taking away mine own life, rather than see you blemish your glory with so
strange an action; whereas then you would not be carried thereunto, but only to
save my life, whenas I should be deprived of it, you would deal in another
manner. It is true, my Lord, that my father is cruel, and inhuman; but
remember, that when the Bassa your father would have banished us from his
house, I left not respecting him; have the same thought for Arsalon: Regard him
rather as a man whom misfortune has bereft of reason, than as one that is
wicked; and to say all, consider him as my father. I do not refuse to deliver
oyurs, but contrarily, I conjure you to permit me to do it, but have also the
goodness to spare mine. Heaven can witness, answered Osman, after he had raised
her up, whether I have any intent to hurt Arsalon; no, Alibech, I will never do
it; but in the disorder wherein my soul is, I say whatsoever my grief suggests
unto me, without giving my reason leisure to examine whether the thing be just,
or whether it be not. In fine, generous Ibrahim, after so long and so sad a
conversation, Osman, not able either to deliver his father, or deprive himself
of his wife, or fight with Arsalon, resolved at least, and made Alibech resolve
so too, to go with all his Fleet, and set himself in the sight of that of
Arsalon; for all the Pirates of the seas of the Levant had a little before
betaken themselves to him, and acknowledged him for their Chieftain. It was
nevertheless after he had promised Alibech, that he would not fight with him;
and that it should be only to endeavor to make him do that by fear which he
could not make him do by reason. All the difficulty of the matter was but to
know precisely where he was; but this obstacle lasted not long: for Osman
having sent for the Persian to come again to him, he talked to him with so much
address, that he learnt the place of his retreat; after which he told this man
in a gentle manner, for fear his father should be ill entreated, that before he
answered directly to the proposition which had been made to him, he would
willingly have a Letter from his father, to the end that being sure he was
living, he might deal with the more certainty. The Persian finding some justice
in Osmans demand, presently left him, with a promise to return him an answer of
it within a few days; but take heed, said he unto him, that you go not away,
for fear lest Arsalon should revenge himself on your father, if you should
deceive him. So Osman having assured him that he would not stir; and this
Persian having set sail, he made his whole Fleet to steer the same course; so
that two days after, at the break of day, the Pirate Arsalon, who could not
oblige the Bassa to write to his son, saw his whole Navy appear. At first his
design was to fight with it, and to that effect, he caused also his Fleet to be
made ready; but when as that of Osman approached, and that enlarging it self, he
could distinctly count all the vessels, whereof it was composed, he found it so
great, and his so small in comparison of it, as seeing that it would have been
temerity and folly in him, to hope for the Victory with so unequal a number,
he took another resolution: And after he had instructed the same Persian whom
he had formerly employed, with his intentions, he sent him back to Osman; who
seeing a vessel loose from Arsalons Fleet, and coming toward him, hoped that
it might be his design had succeeded. Alibech was not of this opinion; and fear
so absolutely oppressed her soul, as there was no place left for hope: And
truly she had reason; for this man was no sooner brought before Osman, but he
made it appear by the confusion which he had in his countenance, that the
message which he was to deliver was fatal. I come hither, my Lord, said he
unto him, to tell you, that if you do not render Alibech, and do attempt to set
upon Arsalon, he will make your father be slain before your eyes; and to
deprive you too of the pleasure of revenge, if he happen to have the worst in
the fight, he will blow up himself, and so steal from your victory. This
strange discourse surprised Osman and Alibech in such sort, as they stood a
good while beholding one another, and not able to speak, but their resentment
suddenly breaking forth, they said all that an extreme grief can make one
think. It is no longer time to consult, said the generous Alibech, our love
would be criminal if it could produce so strange an effect. Suffer me, my dear
Osman, suffer me to go and make trial all alone of my fathers fury; for
provided I can restore you yours, death will not be altogether cruel to me. In
vain you seek for other remedies to your misery; and as things stand, I ow my
self not only to him which has given you life, but I ow my self also to
Arsalon, to the and I may keep him from dipping his hands in innocent blood. As
for me, he may deal with me as he pleases; I am his daughter; I have abandoned
him; I have robbed him of two slaves; and if he can complain of any one, it
must doubtless be of me. Your accusing of your self in this sort, said Osman
then, is to put me in remembrance of the obligations wherein I stand engaged to
you; and it is to say to me also, Do not abandon me. Do not you abandon me,
answered she, but suffer me to abandon you. I cannot, replied Osman. Bot could
you indeed, said Alibech to him, see a dagger in my fathers hand to stab the
heart of yours? For my part, continued she, I would rather dye. Let us die
then, said Osman to her; for I tell you once again, that it is as equally
impossible for me to resolve to lose my father, as to abandon you. In pursuance
of this discourse, Alibech did yet what she could to obtain her husbands
permission that she might go to her father: She joined tears to her prayers,
and albeit that which she desired would destroy her felicity, bereave her of
her liberty, expose her to the fury of her father, and deprive her of her
husband, yet was she so generous, as to omit nothing of whatsoever she thought
was capable of persuading him not to refuse her that she demanded. But seeing
at last that she entreated in vain, and that Osman unable to resolve on any
thing, yet seemed to be resolved not to render her, she purposed to make use of
a kinsman of the Bassa of the sea, whom she had won after the first time that
Arsalons Messenger came thither: And that she might talk with him at liberty,
and without suspicion, I see very well, said she to Osman, that the tears which
I shed to move your heart, do but harden it the more, and that as long as you
see me, you can resolve of nothing, wherefore suffer me to withdraw my self,
and remember, said she unto him, that the life of your father is in question.
After this, she retired into the Captains cabin, whither having sent for the
Bassa of the Seas kinsman, who she knew was very much affected, and greatly
obliged to him, as holding his fortune of him; When he was come, and that she
could speak to him without witnesses, she summoned him to the performance of
the promise he had made her two days before, to do any thing for the
deliverance of the Bassa of the sea, when she should furnish him with means for
it. For rightly foreseeing that Osman would never resolve to remit her into the
hands of Arsalon, though he was very generous, and that he loved his father
exceedingly, this courageous woman had forecast a way how to beguile him. After
then that she had asked of him, who was to serve her in her design, whether he
was resolved for it or no? and that she had told him how all that she would
have of him was, that he would give her the opportunity the night following to
go to Arsalon in the vessel which he commanded. This man, albeit very much
obliged to the Bassa of the Sea, was notwithstanding somewhat unwilling to
consent thereunto. But Alibech adding art to her entreaties, undertook to
persuade that to him, which she did not believe her self. She told him that her
father would let himself be moved with her tears; that without doubt this
generous action would touch him; and that so without exposing her to any great
danger, she should deliver the Bassa of the Sea. This man then suffering
himself to be carried to what she pleased, promised her not to go aboard his
vessel till it was very late, and that the night was far spent, to the end that
stealing away, he might get her into the skiff that was to carry him thither;
which without doubt might be easily enough done, it being credible, that in the
agitation wherein the mind of Osman was, he would not take much heed to things.
The execution of this enterprise proved yet more facile than Alibech had
imagined it, as you shall understand by and by. Osman, not knowing what to do
in so cross an encounter, after that Alibech was withdravvn, fell into a deep
muse, and began to cast in his mind what he might do. He no sooner formed one
thought, but it was destroyed by another; his imagination propounded nothing
unto him which his judgment could approve of; the motions of nature combated
those of love; and without vanquishing one another, Osman was not surmounted
but by his own grief. He saw in every thing cause of despair, and whereas he
had a noble and generous Soul, being unable to take any resolution which was
not criminal, he remained always irresolute. But at last, after he had a long
time debated with himself; after that love and nature had made him think of all
that they could inspire in a like encounter; after that he had sought for an
hundred unprofitable means how to deliver his father, without losing his wife;
no, no, said he to himself, I cannot lose Alibech, but I must lose my self
too. Let us resolve upon it then, and make the Bassa our Father see, that we
do for him all that we can. He has given me life, I am ready to render it to
him again; and I cannot think that Heaven would approve of the delivering of an
innocent to the cruelty of Arsalon; neither do I think too, added he, but his
revenge would be more satisfied with having me in his hands, than with having
Alibech. And albeit he has not demanded me as well as she, it was doubtless
because he believed, that I would render him my wife, rather than render him my
self. But alas cried he, how was he ill informed of my thoughts! As for my
Father, said he, I may not believe that he can complain of me, since I endanger
my self for the love of him. And as for Arsalon, he will in my person find an
object worthy of his wrath; it is I that stole away his daughter from him; it
is I that was the cause of the flight of that generous Slave, from whom he
expected so many things; in fine, I alone am culpable; and if there be any
justice in his cruelty, I alone too shall be punished. He shall deliver my
Father, or at leastwise I shall wear yrons with him; and if rage carries him to
take away my life, I shall howsoever have the satisfaction to dye, without
having abandoned, either my Father, or my wife. I owe my life to my Father, and
I shall render it to him again, in losing it for his sake. I owe my liberty to
the generous Alibech, and charing my self with the same chains which are
prepared for her, I shall have done for her all that the unhappiness of my
destiny permits me to do. Let us go then, added he, let us go to Arsalon,
since it is as equally impossible for me, to abandon my Father, as to lose
Alibech. This design being strongly imprinted in his heart, he drew the
Persian aside, and told him softly, that as soon as night was come he should
have satisfaction of him, and assured him besides, that if he did not render
Alibech to him, he would at leastwise go along with him in his vessel, and
carry his answer himself to Arsalon. This man, being able to do nothing else,
resolved to wait the time he had appointed; in the mean space Osman sent for
one named Mahomet, a man of command, and one that you know has courage and
experience; and having told him that he was going the next night to try if he
could deliver his father, by means of an intelligence which he had with
Arsalons messenger, he willed him, if by misfortune his design should not
succeed, to command the fleer in his absence, and not to fail in taking
special heed to Alibech, and to send her back to Constantinople in a vessel;
but not before he had tarried some days in the view of Arsalons fleet; and
whatsoever should happen not to fight with him. This man, who was prudent,
would feign have been a little better cleared of Osmans design; but whatsoever
he could do, he could not oblige him unto it; and Osman making use of his
absolute power, he could do no other but obey. After this, Osman went to
Alibech, but whereas both of them had each their design, although they had an
hundred things to say to one another, out of the opinion wherein they were,
that they should never meet again, the desire they had to execute their
enterprise made them say little, fearing lest their conversation being too
long, they should not beguile one another, as they purposed to do. So that
after Osman, to deceive Alibech, had told her that he had put off the sending
away of the Persian till the next day, because he would write to Arsalon to
see if he could persuade with him, he left her for to go and make the visit
about his flee^ in a barque, as he used to do every evening, for fear said he,
of some surprise; but indeed it was to go and imbarque himself in the Persians
Brigantine. Alibech ravished with this favorable occasion, counseled him so to
do, and looking on him as he was going out of the Cabin with her eyes full of
tears, she encountered those of Osman, who believing that he should never see
her more, had turned about his face toward her, as it were to give her his
last farewell. After it was night, and that Osman was gone out of his vessel,
he that was to serve Alibech came to her cabin at such time as all her slaves
were already asleep; and by the favor of the dark he got her into the skiff,
that was to carry them to his vessel, as accordingly it did. He was no sooner
abord then, but he set sail; and his Pilot getting clear of the other vessels
as well as he could, steered directly to Arsalons Fleet. Osman, on his side,
being gotten abord of the Persians Brigantine, had taken the same course; so
that when the broad of day began to appear, and that Arsalon, wakened by his
fury, and by the impatience he was in for the return of him he had sent, and
was mounted on the deck, he saw two vessels appear, one on the right hand, and
the other on the left, which as though they had had a purpose to advance
equally, made with full sails toward the place where he was. He knew at first
his Brigantine, but for the other, he could not apprehend who it was. Osman on
the other part, was not a little troubled to perceive, that the vessel which
he savv was one of his; hovvbe it he believed that his dear Alibech hearing of
his departure, had sent some one of the Commanders of his Fleet after him to
retain him; but he was much amazed, whenas these vessels coming near to one
another, he saw Alibech standing on the deck. Whereupon he gave a great
skreek, and little lacked but through a transport for which he could give no
reason he had not cast himself into the Sea to get to her. How unhappy am I
cried he! I parted from my fleet to save Alibech, and my departure alone
delivers her into the hands of her father; and so I came not without doubt but
to be a spectator of her punishment. But if Osman was amazed, no less was
Alibech; for some of her vessel having known Osman, and having told it to her,
she was infinitely afflicted, and believed the same of Osman which he had
believed of her. In the mean time Arsalon, having sent to discover this
vessel, was much surprised to understand, that Alibech came in that, and not
in his Brigantine; which still approaching as well as the other, made him see
Osman on the poop. Now albeit he could not comprehend that which he saw, yet
was he glad to see more in his hands than he had hoped for; and causing the
Bassa of the Sea, laden with chains, to mount upon the deck, Come said he unto
him, give your yrons to this Slave that betrayed me, and to this ungrateful
daughter that abandoned me. The Bassa discerning his Son, was extremely
afflicted; and Osman seeing his Father in that estate, was sensibly touched
therewith. At length these two vessels being come up to Arsalons, and Alibech
and Osman being brought before him, Behold, said he as they were approaching to
him, these worthy objects of my hatred and wrath, whom their treachery had
drawn out of my power, and whom fortune has restored unto me. We are rather an
object of your pity, answered Alibech, who was foremost, and fallen on her knee
when she came near to Arsalon; but, continued she, I came not hither to moove
you to compassion; I believe that your wrath is equitable, and your hatred
just. And seeing I hold it impossible to reenter into your favor, I come to
break his chains who has been in stead of a father to me, ever since I
abandoned you; do not think that Osman has consented to that which I do, it
is a pure effect of mine own will. Alas! cried Osman then, beholding the Bassa
of the Sea, pardon me dear father, if I could not resolve to give my wife for
to save you; but to testify unto you, that I do whatsoever I can, I am come
hither to take your chains upon me, and to obtain your liberty with the loss
of my life. Wherefore, said he to Arsalon, deliver my Father, and put the
chains on me that he wears. I alone am faulty, and I alone am to be punished;
for as for Alibech, all her crime is nothing else but having compassion of
others misfortunes, Arsalon, seeing two persons so near him, by whom he thought
he had been much abused, could not contain his former fury, and commanded that
the Bassa of the Sea should be loosed, and his chains divided betwixt Osman
and Alibech: but the Bassa being touched with the generosity, both of Alibech
and of Osman, would not suffer himself to be set at liberty. I will not quit my
yrons, said he to Arsalon, to charge my children with them; for I believe,
since you have no more feeling of a father for the virtuous Alibech, that I may
be permitted to call her my daughter. Could you remember the time said he to
her, when I forbad you my house, and yet could you resolve to give your liberty
for a man, who once treated you as a slave? My Lord, answered she, it well
appears by what has arrived this day, that you had reason to be unwilling I
should be your sons wife, since that fatal marriage is the cause of your
unhappiness. But, said she, turning her self toward her father, if I dare put
you in mind of that tenderness which you have had for me, I humbly beseech
you, that without regarding either the generosity of the Bassa, or the prayers
of Osman, you will choose me alone for the object of your anger and revenge,
and will set them at liberty. What, said Osman unto her then, can you desire
that we should be separated? Yes, said she unto him, I can; for since we cannot
live happy together, it is best that you should enjoy your liberty, and that I
alone should be unfortunate. Dispute not hereupon, ungrateful child as thou
art, said Arsalon interrupting her, for if thou art mine by the law of nature,
he who is also my slave, and my guilty slave, shall also be the companion of thy
punishment. Alas! my Lord, said she unto him, for I dare not call you father,
of what crime can you accuse Osman? Would you have had him refuse the liberty
which I offered him? Do not justify me, said Osman, interrupting her, I alone
am culpable; it was I that stole you away; it was I tha^ caused the Slave whom
Arsalon loved so much to fly away; in fine, it was I tha^ have done all these
things: so that my father being innocent as well as you, I am to demand justice
for you both; render it unto them then in this occasion, said he to Arsalon,
and let me suffer all imaginable torments; for provided I may see these two
persons set at liberty, I shall dye willingly, and without grief. We will no^
have it with the price of your blood, cried then both the Bassa of the Sea, and
the generous Alibech, and to save you we are even ready to shed ours. Why will
you not have me deliver my Father, said Osman to her then? For that answered
Alibech, as I am the cause of his misfortune, it is just I should be so too of
his liberty. But said she to Arsalon, consult no further hereupon, Osman loves
me to that height, as he will never yield but by violence. And fear not, my
Lord, said she unto him, to give him his liberty, you will punish him enough in
punishing me; and the irons which I shall wear, will be more heavy to him
without doubt than to me. Arsalon not able to forbear from being moved with so
much generosity, and Alibech having incountred his eyes, where she saw (as she
thought) some marks of tenderness, continued her discourse, and redoubled her
prayers. My Lord, said she unto him, I believe that I my self labor mine own
ruin, and that confessing my self guilty, without seeking excuses for my crime,
I render my self unworthy to obtain that which I desire of you: Wherefore,
continued she, permit me for the lessening of my fault to put you in
remembrance of that blessed time, when as the Pirate Arsalon was a Satrape of
Persia; you know, my Lord, that my Mother abandoned her Parents to follow you,
and that then you called that excess of love and generosity in her, which now
you term an horrible crime in me. It is true, that I have followed Osman, but
it was not as a slave, it was as my husband; and let heaven be my witness,
whether in abandoning you, I do not quit a part of my self; and whether I have
not ever since made vows for your preservation. This mighty Fleet which is
ready to set upon me (said Arsalon to her, who yet did not yield) is without
doubt an effect of your prayers and affection. Alas! answered Alibech, if Osman
would have fought with you, he would not have come and put himself into your
hands without Arms. Consider then, my Lord, if there be any sense of pity
resting in you, whether you can with justice resolve the destruction of a man,
who seeing his father in captivity, has notwithstanding had that respect for
you, as not to fight with you because you were mine; you see too that he is not
an unnatural son, since he comes himself to offer you his liberty and his
life to deliver his father. I conjure you then by the memory of the only
person of the world whom you have most dearly loved, and who gave me life, to
surmount your resentment in this occasion; and to vanquish us in generosity;
you may do it my Lord, if you will, and a greater cannot be than to vanquish
ones self. If you regard us as your children, you will easily pardon us; and if
you consider us as your enemies, we are so wretched, and so absolutely
depending on you, that compassion will be of more power in your soul, than the
desire of revenge, it being most certain that a generous spirit cannot resolve
to oppress the feeble. And then again, my Lord, if you consider it well, you
cannot tell how to punish us, in puni^hing us. If you retain the Bassa still a
prisoner, you will do but that which he demands, for he will not have his
liberty, unless his son does enjoy it too. If you load Osman with Irons, you
satisfy the desire he has to testify to his father, that he would do any
thing for him; and if you lay them on me, they will be in stead of a favor to
me, being absolutely resolved to follow the fortune of these unfortunate ones.
What Arsalon! cried the Bassa of the sea then, shall not the generosity of this
woman, which would move a Barbarian, move a father? What my Lord! added Osman,
cannot Alibechs tears obtain her and my fathers liberty? at leastwise yet let
the loss of my life oblige you unto it. During this discourse, and this noble
dispute, where the prize of the victory was the loss of liberty, Arsalon had
his mind filled with diverse thoughts; the desire of revenge, and a will to
pardon, agitated his soul; but in the end, whereas reason and nature were both
of a side, he began to be moved. He could no longer behold his daughter, but
with tears in his eyes; and both Osmans and his fathers generosity possessing
him with confusion, whereas naturally he loved glory, and was not cruel, but
out of an habit and despair, he suddenly changed his thoughts, and embracing
his daughter with tenderness, I am overcome, said he unto her, thy virtue is
stronger than my cruelty. This happy change begot shouts of joy, not only from
the Bassa, not only from Alibech, not only from Osman, but from all those of
the vessel. In the mean time Osman casting himself at the feet of Arsalon, My
Lord, said he unto him, load me with Irons, and join together all the torments
which ever have been invented, I shall give you thanks in enduring them.
Arsalon hearing him speak thus, lifted him up very kindly, and unloosing the
Bassa of the Sea himself, I should not have done a grace to Alibech, said he
unto him, if I had not done it to you too, since your life is hers. In sequel
hereof, my Lord, it is easy to imagine what these three persons and Arsalon
said, who certainly for his part showed such marks of his repentance, and spoke
so many generous, and obliging things, as it was easy to perceive that he had
not always been a Pirate. Now, my Lord, that I may not prolong this relation
any further, you shall understand, that Arsalon not only pardoned his daughter,
promised an inviolable affection to the Bassa of the sea and his son, but
also took the resolution to cease from being a Pirate: For which effect he
obtained the Bassa of the seas permission to dismiss all them that had ranged
themselves under his obedience; who although they were sorry to lose so
courageous a Chieftain, yet were they comforted with the greatness of the booty
which he left them; and embarquing himself in the same vessel whi^^ had
brought Alibech thither, without reserving any part of the riches which he had
gotten; You see, said he, smiling to the Bassa of the sea and his son, how I
render my self at discretion, and how I confide in your generosity. After this,
my Lord, they went to the Fleet, where was so universal a rejoicing, as the
like has never been heard spoken of. In the mean while, whereas a part of the
Galleys and Vessels had been bruised with the tempest, we made to land, that we
might put them in a condition to follow the first design. And it was there,
generous Ibrahim, where we learned that your Victory had no need of our
succor. This good news being made known to Arsalon, who had been acquainted by
Alibech with the obligation wherein she was engaged unto you, he desired the
Bassa of the sea to obtain of you, that if any treaty of peace were to be made
between the Sultan and the Sophy, you would be pleased to take the care of
making his, and getting him the liberty to go and end his days in his country,
from whence love in times past had banished him. I desire this grace of you
then on the behalf of Arsalon, of the Bassa of the sea, of Osman, and of the
virtuous Alibech, who beseeches you that you will be her protection yet a
second time. Morath having given over speaking, left Ibrahim and Ulama so
ravished with his relation, and the generosity of Alibech, as they thought they
should never have done praising her. Ibrahim promised Morath to re-establish
Arsalon; and having sent him back again the next day, because he assured them
that he should find them still abiding in the Port, where he had left them, he
commanded him to bring Arsalon to him with as much speed as possibly he could,
and to assure all those generous persons, that he should never be contented,
till their virtue were worthily acknowledged. And verily it might be said, that
Ibrahim knew what would happen; for scarcely was Morath a days jour^ey from
the Camp, when as he was advertised that there were Deputies from Sultania that
desired to speak with him; he was told also that these deputies were all in
mourning, and seemed to be extremely afflicted. This novelty surprised him, and
whe^eas Ulama was not present at such time as this message was delivered unto
him, he sent for him in all have, and when he was come to his Tent, and the
Deputies likewise, one amongst them, after he had begun his discourse with an
Elogium of Ibrahim, the better to prepare him not to refuse them that which
they purposed to crave of him, acquainted him with all that had past at
Sultania, since the battle of Niphates, wherewith Ulama and he were strangely
surprised: And truly this relation was extraordinary enough, to beget no mean
amazement. For it had fallen out, that after that day which had proved so
glorious to Ibrahim, and so fatal to the Sophy, the death of Deliment, and the
displeasure for having been vanquished, possessed him with so much grief, as he
fell sick at the very same instant. As for the ambitious Perca, she rejoiced in
her heart at the death of Deliment, as a thing which she had long wished for;
the sicknest of Tachmas did not disquiet her, but contrarily she believed, that
the less able he should be to direct, the more power she should have. As for
the stupid Ismael, she did not regard him as any great obstacle to her design,
she was notwithstanding very much vexed, when she understood of him, after the
loss of the battle, that in the heat of the fight Ulama had given him his life
and his liberty, in drawing him out of the hands of a great many soldiers, who
would have either taken or killed him: For albeit she forbad him to publish
this action, yet was so filled with joy for his escape out of that peril, as
it was impossible for her to keep him from telling it to diverse persons, though
it was not out of any acknowledgement. Perca was not ignorant, that Ulama had a
number of secret friends, who watched but for an occasion ^o declare themselves
for his advantage. She knew likewise, that all which were of Mahamedes and
Axiamiraes party, sought but for a pretext to stir; so as she feared that this
action coming to be known, in the estate wherein things were, use might be
made of it for the making of some propositions to Tachmas, which might be
prejudicial unto her, in the design which she had to reign. But this
unfortunate Prince was not long in a condition to think of the affairs of his
Empire; for albeit his Physicians had employed all their skill for the
preservation of his life, yet could they not possibly save him; and the fourth
day after the loss of the battle, death stiffed that passion in his heart,
which had made him do so much injustice. As soon as he had given up his last
breath, Perca, without amusing her self in unprofitable tears, took great car^
to conceal it, until such time as she was assured of the minds of the
principal persons of Sultania; for as for the men of command, so great a
number were slain in the day of battle, as there scarcely rested any
considerable enough, strongly to oppose what she meant to undertake. She caused
the Council then to be assembled in the name of the S^phy, where she and
Ismael appeared in mourning; and whereas she had wit and subtilty, after she
had with feigned tears made the hearts of those that heard h^rpliant, she
acquainted them with the death of the Sophy, ^raved their assistance for the
direction of Ismael, and in conclusion showed them a paper, which indeed s^e
had made Tachmas to sign, without knowing what he did, whereby he declared,
that in case Ismael should prove incapable of reigning, his intent then was
that the Empire should devolve to Perca, not holding them for his lawful
successors, which had cast themselves into the arms of his enemy. All those
things exceedingly astonished those which heard them; the death of Tachmas
afflicted them; the order which he had left did not please; Ismael's
Sovereignty was a thing they could not resolve for; and that of Perca seemed
yet worse to them. They would willingly have called home again Mahamell,
Axiamira, and Ulama; but besid^s that it was not a proposition to be made to
Perca, they were not ignorant that the exiled Princes were no longer in their
own power, but in theirs that protected them; and that consequently, they were
not to go tumultuously and acquaint the enemy with the death of Tachmas, for
fear lest he should make use of this advantage to ruin them; yea, and those
persons too whom he had in his hands, and which were so infinitely dear unto
them. The most of them then resolved, without making any show thereof, to defer
the manifestation of their hatred to Perca, of their contempt of Ismael, and of
their affection to Mahamed, Axiamira, and Vlama, until such time as they had
recovered new forces, to the end they might oppose Perca, and to the end also
that in making some propositions of peace, they might yet be in a condition to
defend themselves, if it were refused. Concealing then their true meaning,
after they had lamented the death of Tachmas, they acknowledged Ismael for
their lawful Prince; saying nevertheless to Perca, that she was to assist him
with her counsel, and that she should reign under the name of Ismael. This
Princess, who thought that the most faithful might be corrupted, and that
particular interest was always preferred before honor and glory, because such
were her true thoughts, believed, that if she enriched all these which were in
this counsel, she should absolutely gain them to her self, and oblige them to
set the crown on her head. To which effect, whenas the Assembly was ready to
break up, she said further, that the Sophy her Father having given all his
treasure unto her, by a testament which he had made in her favor (as indeed it
was true) she did not think that she could better dispose of it, than in
distributing it amongst those, that were capable of aiding Ismael to sustain
the Scepter which he was going to bear. After this, she made them pass, though
they were unwilling to it, into a great room, where she had caused all the
Sophyes riches, and treasure, to be laid; to the end that by the sight of so
tempting an object, their hearts might be overcome with the desire of making
themselves masters of it. They proved notwithstanding more generous than she
imagined; for although they testified a great deal of acknowledgement to her
for her liberality, yet would they not accept of it. In the mean time they
resolved to let no body go out of the City, which might acquaint the enemy
with the death of Tachmas; for being so powerful as he was, it might give him
a mind to come and assault them in Sultania, which otherwise it may be he
would not do. During all these things, every one had their designs; Perca
thought of nothing but of making Ismael to be hated; the friends of Mahamed,
Axiamira, and Vlama, attended with impatience the troops which were to come
unto them from the remote Provinces, to the end they might do that which they
thought would be most requisite; Ismael sought how he might free himself from
the care of affairs. Things having continued some time in this sort, it happened
in the end that the same facility, which she had so much liked in Ismaels
disposition, gave her a great deal of unquietness, for even i^ the like manner
as she had made her self mistress of it, so did others: he was no sooner out of
his sight, but this Prince altered his mind according to the humor of those
that talked with him; and whereas every one was enemy to Perca, as often as she
returned to him, she found him changed; and thought it was not difficult for
her to bring him to her bow again, yet she feared that at some time or other
use would be made of his name to undo her. They, unto whom Ismael had told
that Vlama had saved his life, having reported it to others, all the people
came to know it, and began to murmr far more than before. And whereas in such
like occasions a weak beginning has many times great and long consequences;
Perca going about to punish one of Ulamaes ancient domestical servants, for
something he had said against her, the people mutined in such sort, as they
went and besieged her in her Palace. The servants of Mahamed and Axiamira began
then to discover their true intents, in not opposing as much as they might the
fury of his incensed people, who began to cry in the streets, let the cruel
Perca dye, and long live Mahamed and Axiamira. In the mean time Perca, finding
her self in so great a danger, would have made use of Ismael to reduce this
multitude to their duty, by obliging him to take up arms and show himself to
the people. But Ismael who naturally was cowardly and fearful, seeing the
danger near, little company about him, and hearing from the chamber where he
was that horrible noise which always accompanies sedition, answered her
trembling, that for his part, he had rather yield the Crown to Mahamed, than
to expose himself to the loss of his life. Ah base coward, cried this ambitious
Princess, whosoever is capable of yielding up a Crown, is not worthy to live!
In the mean season, the first gates of the Palace were forced, there wanted no
more but breaking up the rest for to get in, they which guarded them having
abandoned them. In this dreadful estate, Perca taking a dagger, which had been
brought to Ismael out of a belief that he would have armed himself, and seeing
that she could not avoid falling into the power of a people filled with fury,
did yet what she could to get him to show himself. She joined threatenings to
entreaties, and perceiving at last that all which she said was in vain, and
that in an instant she should no longer be mistress of her self, rage so seized
on her soul, as presenting the dagger unto him with an extreme transport;
Choose, said she unto him, either to pierce my heart, or to do what I would
have you. And when as Ismael had told her, that he would not do either the one
or the other, and that she heard a great noise, whereby she knew that the la^t
door was broken open; since thou know not, said she unto him, either how to
reign, or how to obey, I will keep thee at leastwise from dying a shameful
death; saying so she stabbed the dagger into Ismaels heart, who presently fell
down dead, and without further delay struck it into her own bosom, and falling
down upon her brothers body, she ceased to be ambitious in ceasing to live.
These conspirators being entered into the Palace, and having learned from some
of the Princess women the cause of Ismaels death, and likewise that of Perca,
they redoubled their cries, and testified as much joy, as if all their enemies
had been defeated. In the mean time the wisest and the most considerable of
Sultania had begun to oppose the people, although they loved not Perca; but
coming to understand the success of the business, they held it not fit to
incense them, but rather in so strange an accident to make use of their zeal in
favor of Mahamed and Axiamira. After then that they had let them know, how
there was no further need of taking up arms, since the object of their hate
was no longer in an estate to hurt them; after that for the calming of their
fury, they had removed the bodies of Ismael and Perca out of the way; and after
that they had promised speedily to settle a peace for them, and call home their
exiled Princes, every one retired to his own house: and the Council being set,
it was advised, that it was no time any longer to defer the propounding of a
peace; because if the news of this strange accident should be spread over the
Provinces, it might furnish them with a pretext to revolt, and work the utter
subversion of this Empire; and that in fine, it was better to yield something
unto the enemy, than to put in hazard the losing of all. After this, they chose
the most understanding amongst them to be sent as Deputies to Ibrahim, with an
absolute power to treat of all things. The grand Visior, as I have said, having
received them in the presence of Vlama, and they having acquainted him with
this horrible adventure, he that spoke for all the rest, added further, that
knowing his generosity they came to propound a peace unto him, upon reasonable
conditions; and to demand Prince Mahamed, the Princess Axiamira, and Vlama of
him, for the restoring of them to the rank which they ought to hold. That if
so be Soliman was their protector, he was to testify it in this occasion;
that to draw an unjust advantage from these illustrious persons being in his
power, would be the violating of the Law of Nations, and natural equity,
since they were there as those that fled to him for refuge, and not as
prisoners; but to be contented with the glory of vanquishing, and restoring of
those to the Sophies Throne, which might lawfully pretend unto it, was to do a
brave and famous action; that there were more examples found of such as had
conquered Empires, than of such as had rendered up Kingdoms; and that there were
more which knew how to vanquish their Enemies, than surmount their own
ambition. After that this man had said all that he believed was capable to
advance the business which he propounded, Ibrahim answered him, that being
thoroughly informed of all the Sultans intentions, and having power to resolve
on any thing without receiving new directions, he could assure them that they
should have cause to commend him; that his grief was, he could not keep Mahamed
and Axiamira from receiving this peace with tears, since they had so lamentable
an occasion for it; but whereas this affair directly concerned them, they were
to treat with them about it; that in the mean time he held it requisite, that
one of them should return to Sultania, to assure the people that ere long they
should see their lawful Princes again; and that the rest should go to
Bitilisa, to do their duty to Mahamed and Axiamira; that to comfort them for
the grief which so doleful an accident would bring them, Ulama should take the
pains both to conduct them thither, and also to accompany the Prince, Princess,
and Felixana back when they returned. Ulama perceiving that Ibrahim in turning
himself toward him, seemed to demand his consent for that which he had spoken,
assured him that he was very ready to do it. And whereas he was generous, I
doubt not, said he, but the Prince and Axiamira will be sensibly touched with
this loss, since I that am not obliged thereunto by so strict bonds, and that
have seen my self the object of the hatred and persecution of those whom I
bewail, cannot choose but be grieved at the accident which is befallen them.
After that Ulama had given sufficient proof of his generosity by his sorrow,
and that Ibrahim had commended him for so noble a resentment, he gave him
commission to take care of the Deputies of Sultania till the next day, when he
thought it fit they should depart for to go and fetch Mahamed, which
accordingly was executed. Ulama parted with those that were to accompany him,
carrying Letters from Ibrahtm to the Princess; one of the Deputies went to
Sultania, and the Grand Vizier remained with a joy that cannot be expressed; for
whereas he was persuaded that the beginning of his felicity depended on the
happy end of this war, seeing the favorable means which fortune presented him
with to terminate it speedily and with glory, he could not render thanks enough
to heaven for so advantageous a success. And whereas he knew that the people
generally desired peace, he was assured that the treaty of it would be
agreeable to every body; not knowing that Soliman had any other interest in
this war, than that of the glory of his Arms. In this thought it might be said,
that never any Lover absent from his Mistress was so happy as he, whilst he
entertained himself with so sweet a hope. In the mean time Ulama arrived at
Bitilisa, presented the Deputies to Prince Mahamed and the Princess Axiamira,
and delivering Ibrahim's letter to her, and acquainting them with the loss they
had sustained, they being generous instantly forgot all the persecutions they
had suffered, and no longer remembered ought but that Tachmas was their father,
Ismael was their brother, and Perca their sister; in the thought whereof they
were extremely afflicted with their loss. But at length, Ulama having imparted
to them the generous designs of Ibrahim, and how necessary their presence was
to their people for their consolation against so many miseries as they had
endured, they set forth on their way. As for Ulama, the sight of his dear
Felixana comforted him for the loss of his enemies, and the Princes and
Princesses sorrow was to both of them their greatest displeasure. In the end
after they had traveled with as much speed as the accommodation of Axiamira
would permit, they arrived at Ibrahims Camp; who understanding that they were
at hand went to receive them with three thousand of his own quarter; and to
testify the more respect unto them he appeared that day in mourning, and said
so many generous and obliging things unto them, as they were constrained to
acknowledge, that if fortune had done him right, he should have been King of
all the world. When as Ibrahim had conducted them to their Tents, which he had
caused to be prepared for them with a great deal of magnificence, and had
treated Mahamed, as being Sophy of Persia, he said unto him, that he was happy
amidst his unhappiness, in beginning his reign with the end of the war, and in
being able to make the first declaration, which he should publish to his
people, be a Treaty of peace; but that he might not defer this pleasure to
them, and this glory to himself, it behoved him to propound such a one as he
would have. It is not for the vanquished, said Mahamed, to impose a Law on the
vanquishers, but only for them to receive it. He that knows to use a victory
so well, said Axiamira interrupting him, as to speak in this sort to them which
ow their lives and liberty to him, ought alone to make it such as he pleases,
since it is certain that he can do nothing that is unjust. After that these
illustrious persons had rendered all the civilities to one another which their
generosity obliged them unto, they fell to accord upon the Articles of this
peace, which were so advantageous for the two Empires, and so glorious for
Ibrahim, as the people and the soldiers, who will meddle with judging of all
things without knowledge, and out of interest, could find nothing to murmr
at. This Treaty, having been signed by Axiamira, for the supplying of Mahameds
defect, was also signed by Ibrahim, by Ulama, by the Deputies of Sultania, and
by the chiefest of Ibrahims Army. After this, Mahamed, who had always loved
Axiamira exceedingly, desired her that she would share in his power, and having
requested her that she would be his guide, she promised him, that as she had
never had a design to marry, so she would neither think of it, nor abandon him.
And in this manner she satisfied that which she owed to her own inclination,
that which Mahamed desired of her, and that which the memory of Prince Gianger
required of her generosity. Mahamed then asked of Ulama, whether he would not
enjoy the felicity of his reign? And think not, said he unto him, that
succeeding to the Sophy, I will succeed to his passions; I shall be your
Prince, and your Friend, but I shall never be your Rival. Ulama answered to
this discourse with a great deal of generosity; and whereas the love to ones
Country is strong enough in every man's soul; and whereas there was a very
straght union between all these illustrious persons; though Ulama was
exceedingly obliged to the Sultan, and that he loved Ibrahim as much as
himself, yet he resolved to abandon his protector for to follow his lawful
Prince. Things being in this estate, Arsalon arrived luckily for himself,
accompanied with Osman and Alibech; and whereas Ibrahim was presently
advertised thereof, he went and received them, and conducted them to Axiamiraes
Tent, where Mahamed was: and after he had recounted unto them the history of
Arsalon, whereof the beginning was not unknown to them; after he had commended
the generosity of Osman and Alibech, and excused the violence of her father, he
obtained this grace of the new Sophy, who engaged his word to him to restore
him to his former dignity. In the mean time the Articles of the Peace had been
published, both in the Army, and in Sultania, with great signs of rejoicing on
either side; and the hour of separation being come, the Sophy said to Ibrahim,
that owing his Life, his Liberty, and the Crown which he was going to wear,
unto him, he felt himself obliged to tell him, that he should always find him
ready to hazard them for his service: In fine, said he unto him, generous
Ibrahim, I ow unto you not only that which you have done for me, not only the
good which my Empire receives from you, but also that which you have done for
the Princess Axiamira, for Felixana, and for Ulama. Judge after this, if
without being ungrateful I can be meanly acknowledging. And I profess unto
you, added he, in taking his last farewell of him, that the most sensible
sorrow which ever my blindness gave me, is that which I now feel, for that I
cannot see my Protector. Jbrahim going to answer him, was hindered from it by
Axiamira; Defend not your self, said she unto him, with an unjust modesty, and
permit, that now at parting, we may testify unto you, how not finding means to
oblige you, we are not unworthy to be obliged, since we know how to prize your
virtue, and esteem of the rare qualities that are in you. And for my
particular, added she, I hold Soliman to be greater, more mighty, and more
happy in having you for his Subject, than in being Master of so great a number
of Provinces, which make him to be redoubted over all the earth. You so
confound me, Madam, answered Jbrahim, with an high respect, as I cannot answer
you; but know, said he, that into what part of the world soever fortune carries
me, you shall ever have of me a faithful and passionate servant. If one might
be a Subject out of choice, you would have too many, said he unto them, your
virtue would make deserts of all your Neighbors Kingdoms; and this conquest
would be so much the more glorious to you, for that it would not extend to any
but to reasonable persons; for that you would have none but illustrious
subjects; and for that without arms you would disarm all your Enemies. After
many other civilities, Mahamed being mounted alone into a Chariot, and Axiamira
into another with her dear Felixana, who in her particular had rendered thanks
unto Ibrahim for all the happiness of her life; Ulama stayed yet a little while
with him; and though they said little, yet left they not testifying the extreme
affection which they bore to one another; since maugre the interests which were
to separate them, they felt a world of grief. Arsalon in like manner thanked
Ibrahim for the grace he had obtained for him, and for that which he had
formerly done to Alibech; who seeing her father part could not forbear shedding
of tears; Osman did the like; and the Grand Vifier having promised Arsalon to
take care of them, and to protect them as much as he could, this generous
Pirate comforting his daughter, told her, that owing more to her husband than
to him, it was just that she should follow his fortune; and that she had done
enough in getting him the honor and liberty to go and die in his country, to
make it appear she had quitted her self toward him for the life he had given
her. At last all these generous persons being separated, Osman and Alibech
began their journey, and Ibrahim having given them a Convoy to secure them from
the outrage of disbanded Soldiers, which they should happen to meet with,
thought of nothing but of withdrawing his troops out of the enemies country; to
the end that being upon the frontire, he might quit the Army, and go to carry
the news himself of his Victory, and of the Peace to Solimon. He discamped then
the next day with a great deal of order and diligence; howbeit he had the
satisfaction before his going out of Persia to understand, that Mahamed had
been received into the throne of his Fathers with joy; that Ulama had married
Felixana; that Arsalon was received to his dignity; and that after so many
misfortunes those Illustrious persons were happy: For Mahamed and Axiamira
took care to advertise him of it, in sending him so magnificent a Present, as
there was no King in the world but it was worthy of. Axiamira wrote also to
Soliman in the name of the Sophy and of her self, wherein with a great deal of
address she found the means to make the Illustrious Bassaes Elogium. In the
mean time he advanced as much as he could, and they were no sooner in Solimans
Territories, but he committed the conduct of them to the Bassa Piali; and after
he had sent one of his servants certain days before hand to Pera, he took the
same way, followed by some of the Commanders: and wholly filled with hope,
love, and joy, he arrived there when as it was so late in the night, as the
Port was shut, and the Guards set; so that how impatient soever he was to see
Isabella, he was constrained to attend till the next morning, being unwilling
for this time to make use of the privilege which he had.

The Fifth Book.
THe Illustrious Bassa having past the whole night without sleeping, so much
had the hope of seeing Isabella pleasingly entertained him, sent as soon as the
Sun appeared to know whether Soliman would be pleased that he should come wait
upon him, and render him an account of his voyage. The Sultan surprised with a
thing which he had not much apprehended, in regard he thought it not so near,
gave not his answer so speedily. He marvelled at the grand Visiers return,
considering the order which he had sent him, not to come back before he heard
from him, what prosperous success soever he should happen to have; but in fine,
it being no longer time to reason on things past, and being constrained to
answer precisely to that which was demanded of him, his mind was in a great
disorder. The name of Ibrahim, who was so near, possessed him with some
remorse of his fault, but the thought then of losing the Princess, made him
instantly repent him of so good a motion, and wish never to see Ibrahim more,
that he might still retain Isabella, whom he had not seen since that cruel
instant, wherein out of his fear of the Bassaes return he had joined
threatenings to entreaties, and given her but only eight days time to resolve
once for all, whereof six were already past when as the Bassa came back to
Constantinople; and he had been three months away without any news at all of
him, so exactly had the resolution which he had taken for it been executed. But
in fine, how violent soever Solimans love was, yet could he not resolve to see
Ibrahim, and keep Isabella from him: For whereas he had always a strong
disposition in his heart to good, and some thoughts of friendship for the Grand
Vizier, the shame of his crime, the small hope he had of vanquishing Isabella,
and the short time he had to resolve in, made him send Ibrahim word that he
might come presently; and that at his arrival he should find Isabella at his
Palace, whither he was going to return her: This Prince certainly would never
have yielded to this, had he had any hope left of gaining the Princesses heart;
but since the day that he had last spoken with her, and that he had taken great
care to have her narrowly observed, he had learnt, that she was in so great an
affliction, as he was afraid the extremity of her grief would kill her: So that
considering he should commit a crime to no purpose, if he should retain
Jsabella, he was the more easily induced to let her go forth of the Seraglio.
In this thought he would not see her, but sent for the Sultana Asteria, who
was no sooner come to him, but he commanded her to go and tell Jsabella, that
Ibrahim was returned, and that out of an excess of bounty he permitted her to
go out of the Seraglio; but that she should beware of acquainting the Grand
Vizier with ought that he had said unto her, because an extreme-mischief might
thereby arrive both to him, and to her. Asteria went and executed her
commission with a great deal of pleasure; for albeit she loved Isabella very
dearly, yet the desire of her conser^ation was stronger in her soul, than her
own content. The Princess received this news with so excessive a joy, as her
heart was not capable of resenting it sufficiently; Emilia likewise was
infinitely glad of it: At first Jsabella could not believe it; after she had
believed it she gainsayd her self; and she was so accustomed to misfortune, as
she could not think so great a good hap was befallen her. In the mean time the
Chariot, which was to carry her to Jbrahims Palace, being come, she embraced
the Sultana Asteria; promised her that Soliman should have no cause to complain
of he^; gave her thanks for her goodness in protecting her; assured her that
she would never lose the memory of it; and then she got into the Chario^ with
Emilia, and went to Jbrahims Palace to meet with her friends, to whom she gave
a greater and a purer joy, than that which she felt her self, for as she was
going into the Chariot, that Slave, whom Soliman had so often employed to her,
came and told her from him, that in going out of the Seraglio she did not go
out of his power, and that he would not fail to send to know her resolution;
that nevertheless he would to favor her give her yet eight days longer for it.
For as if the Prince had undertaken to be his own enemy, and to punish his own
fault, he scarcely formed a design but he straightway destroyed it; so that he
had no sooner let Isabella know that she should go out of the Seraglio, but he
seemed to repent it, and sent that slave, Roxelanaes confident, with that
message to her: and she was no sooner gone, but his love, and the desire of
seeing her augmented; nevertheless in regard the thing was done, and that
Ibrahim was suddenly to arrive, he changed not his order. In the mean time the
grand Vizier, having made no doubt but that he should easily obtain the
permission which he had desired of Soliman, caused a stately Galliot, which he
knew was in the Arsenal at Pera, to be launched into the water; and it was for
this purpose that he had sent one of his servants certain days before, to the
end he should give order secretly for the having of it in a readiness against
he came. As soon then as he understood the Sultans pleasure he imbarqued
himself, attended by all the Commanders which had accompanied him: and truly
there was never a more magnificent or more agreeable object seen than this
Galliot, especially when Ibrahim was abord it. All that was looked upon was
painted and gilt; the whole Poop was hung with Persian Tapestry, whose ground
was gold; it was covered all over with flaggs and streamers of diverse colors;
all the slaves that rowed were fastened with silver chains, and all of them had
garments of cloth of gold; twelve Trumpeters were on the Coursey clothed in
velvet, whose ground was gold; all the Commanders apparel was imbroidered
with pearls and diamonds; and in the midst of this stately troup stood
Ibrahim alone, though he had six great cushions of cloth of gold at his feet;
He held in his hand a battoun of command, and was so superbly apparelled, as it
was easy to perceive that this petty triumph was an effect of peace, since
riches and abundance were every where seen, and very few marks of war. Ibrahim
had that day on a robe of cloth of silver, imbroidered with gold and diamonds,
intermixed with certain carnation silk twist, which added very much to the
beauty of that habit; His turbant was covered all over with carnation and white
plumes of feathers, set up with jewels of diamonds of an inestimable value; His
Scymitar, and the golden chains whereunto it was fastened, were answerable to
the gorgeousness of his garment: now although silk, silver, gold, pearl, and
diamonds richly appeared there, yet might it be said with truth, that Ibrahim
gave rather a new luster to all those things, than that he recived any from
them. His shape was goodly, well made, and advantageous; his carriage free and
noble; his face ovall; his eyes black, and full of fire and sweetness; his
mouth agreeable; his complexion neither too delicate, nor too gross, neither
too pale, nor too red; but such as Mars is painted, when as he is amorously
represented unto us; His hayr was of chestnut color; and his nose somewhat
aquilin, yet so as it served to give him the better aspect; His physiognomy was
promising and sprightfull; his soul was seen in his eyes, his courage and his
affability appeared equally in them; and without having ought of the beauty of
a woman, he was the goodliest man that ever was beheld. In fine there was seen
in his whole person, a lofty air without pride, a gallanterie without
affectation, a neglectfull handsomness, a freeness without artifice, a civility
without constraint, and something so great and so high therein, as one could not
behold him without judging him worthy to wear a crown. All these natural
graces had a new luster the day wherein Ibrahim entered into Constantineople,
and the hope of seeing Isabella had painted such a joy in his face, as gave him
a certain extraordinary agreeableness. This petty triumph was not without
spectators; for Ibrahims return being known, whereas he was universally
beloved, all the Grandees of the Port, and all the people of Constantinople,
repaired to the Haven, and by the shouts which they gave as soon as the Galliot
approached, they testified their zeal and affection to him. Soliman, more
provoked than by the agitation of his soul, and by an impatience without
reason, than by the good will which he bore to Ibrahim, had also placed himself
upon a Terrace with a Ballustrade of Jasper, which looks to the Sea on that
side; and when every one still continued their shouts of joy, Must all these
people, said he to himself, reproach me with my fault; must the sight of
Ibrahim cause more joy in them than in me? and must he be more beloved of them
than of me, who am obliged thereunto by so many reasons? Yes, said he, Love and
Isabella will have it so, and I cannot hinder it. But at length Ibrahims
Galliot being come so near, as it permitted him to discern Soliman, who was
leaning on the Balustrade, he saluted him with a profound respect, and being
landed, all the people redoubled their shouts. The most considerable approached
to salute him, and they that could not do so, did at the least what they could
to be seen of him. After that this multitude had sufficiently considered him,
whom they acknowledged for their Protector, Ibrahim, followed by all ^he
Grandees, and all the people, went to the Seraglio, where he entered alone; for
Soliman feeling the disorder of his soul, would not give him any but a private
audience. When as he was come into the Sultans chamber, Soliman could not choose
but be somewhat glad, yet was he possessed with confusion at the very same
instant, and received not the Bassa with that freeness, wherewith he was wont
to testify the affection which he bore him. Before time, he would rather have
spoken to him of the grief his absence had been the cause of to him; of the
fear he was in for him; of the health of Isabella; and of the joy he had for
his return; than of affairs of State: but in this encounter, he would needs
have him at the very first render him an account of the War; and although he
had resolved to give Ibrahim no marks of the disorder of his soul, yet could he
not forbear it. In the midst of his relation he asked of him, whether he had
not received a new order which he had sent him? And when as Ibrahim had assured
him that he had not, he seemed to be vexed at it, without telling him what it
was: And at such time as the Grand Vizier had informed him, how advantageous
the peace which he had made in Persia was for him, he could not choose but tell
him things, which might make him judge, that he would have been glad he had not
terminated the War as yet. Howbeit Ibrahim suspected nothing else of it, but
that during his absence Roxlana and Rustan had persuaded him from making a
Peace so soon. This thought gave him some unquietness, nevertheless it
presently diminished; for Soliman perceiving what he had done, disguised his
mind a little better; and out of a sense of jealousy, he began to caress
Ibrahim more, to the end that retaining him the longer with him, he should not
go so soon to see Isabella; it being certain that out of ^n excess of passion,
Solim^n looked no more on the Bassa after his return, but with that
unquietness, which the sight of a favored Rival gives. But at length Ibrahim,
who did not penetrate into the truth of things, seeing that the Sultan still
retained him, and that he had no sooner answered to one question, but
straightway he asked him another; My Lord, said he unto him (with the same
freedom wherewith he was used to talk to him) will thy highness be pleased to
permit me, now that I have given an account of my voyage to my Master, that I
may go and do my duty to my Mistress. Soliman blushed at this discourse, and
desiring to conceal his confusion from the Bassa, he dismissed him sooner than
otherwise he would have done; and remained in so extraordinary an unquietness,
as he thought twenty times to call back Ibrahim, to send and seize upon
Isabella, to secure himself of the one, to cause the other to be brought into
the Seraglio again, and in the end to proceed to the l^st violence. A little
beam of light, and a great deal of confusion, kept him nevertheless from
executing his bad designs; and his soul was never so resolved for evil, as
that he could do it without repugnancy. In the mean time Ibrahim went to his
Palace, where he was expected with a great deal of impatience; but he was
exceedingly surprised, when as he found, Doria, Horatio, Alphonso, and the
French Marquis waiting for him in the Fore-Court. At first he doubted of the
report of his eyes, yea and was a good while hearing his friends talk, before
he could absolutely believe that which he saw to be true. He embraced them all
with as much transport of joy, as he had affection for them; for all those that
had followed him, had out of respect and by his commandment left him at the
first entrance into his Palace. But above all the rest he could not choose but
behold Doria with amazement, and ask of him whether it were true indeed that it
was he? As they were standing there, Ibrahim chancing to cast up his eyes was
yet more amazed, when as he espied on the foot-pace of the Ballustrade that
divided his Court, Isabella coming toward him; accompanied with Sophronia,
Hipolita, Emilia, and Leonida. What enchantment, cried he in advancing toward
Isabella, makes me see so many wonders together? am I at Constantinople, or at
Genoua? and may I believe what I see? You are still in a place, said Isabella,
where you have been extremely wished for, and where vows have been made for
your return. You see, Madam, said he unto her, in kissing her hand which she
had given him, that they have not been in vain, since I can assure you, that my
voyage has been prosperous, and that I am still absolutely yours. After this,
Ibrahim saluted these four beautiful companions of the unfortunate Isabella,
who each of them in their particular made him a complement; and then Ibrahim
having lent the Princess his hand, this fair troop entered into the Palace, and
went to Isabellaes chamber. It was there where these illustrious friends
testified the true thoughts which they had for one another; Ibrahim
nevertheless marvelled to see fewer marks of joy in Isabellaes face, than in
that of all the rest, which had not so much interest in his person:
Notwithstanding whereas he saw that her complexion was a little pale, he
believed that it was an effect of some sickness which she had had; and in this
thought he went on in entertaining his friends with liberty enough of spirit.
He understood confusedly, and in few words, that which had brought them to
Constantinople, but not without grief was he acquainted with the Count of
Lavagnaes and Leonoraes deplorable death. You see, said Isabella to him then
sighing, that there is never any joy so pure for us, but it is mixed with some
bitterness. She said this in such a fashion, as gave him cause to think that
Isabella had some thing which was displeasing in her mind; so that he resolved
as soon as in civility he could speak to her without being heard, not to lose
the occasion for it, which instantly presented it self. For all those persons
were too intelligent, and knew too well how to love, to be ignorant, that after
a long absence it would have been some inhumanity to keep two hearts that loved
one another so perfectly, from communicating their thoughts in private; so that
presently after they were risen from meat, some went into the Cabinet, some
into the Gallery, and Aemilia alone remained in a corner of the chamber with
the French Marquis. In the mean time Isabella was not without unquietness, the
remembrance of what Soliman had said to her possessed all her soul, and the
incertainty wherein she was, whether she should impart it to Jbrahim, or
whether she should not speak to him of it, put her mind upon the wrack. What
shall I do, said she to her self, in so cross an encounter? If I conceal the
truth of that which has befallen me from him, I trespass against our
affection, and it may be put his life and my honor in jeopardy: But if I tell
it to him, continued she, and he cannot forbear testifying somewhat of it, when
as the Sultan has enjoined me not to speak of it, we are undone, and nothing
can save us. If I stay too, added she, till Soliman sends to me for the answer,
which he will have me give him within eight days, what shall I do then? and
what shall I say to Jbrahim? And if I come to the point to be constrained to
acquaint him with his unhappiness and mine, what may he think of my silence?
and what lawful excuse can I make to him for it? But if it should happen too,
that Soliman has repented him, and that he sent not the slave to me, but only
to try my discretion, I should be guilty of all the mischiefs that might follow
thereupon, if by my imprudence and by my inconsideration I should go and
acquaint Jbrahim with a thing which certainly he could never conceal. In this
uncertainty was the Princess, when as Jbrahim remained alone with her; and
whereas this thought made her extremely musing: May I, said he unto her, Madam,
without losing the respect which I owe unto you, complain to you of your self,
in reproaching you for that you have not as much joy for my return, as you had
grief for my departure? If this be a crime, said the Princess, it is true that
I am guilty of it; yet can I assure you, added she, that it is not occasioned
by any defect of affection, but by an habit which I have gotten of melancholy,
I am afflicted more easily than I am comforted; I am more sensible of grief,
than of joy; and in the estate wherein I find my self, there needs more things
by far to content me, than there needs to render me infinitely unhappy. It is
not, continued she, because your return does not give me all the joy that I am
capable of, and even to that height, as without this remedy I am persuaded I
should not have lived long; but in conclusion we are at Constantinople, and
that is no little evil. Jbrahim hearing Isabella speak in this sort, and
observing her eyes and her face, he confirmed himself yet more in the opinion
which he had; so that to be the better cleared therein, I confess, said he unto
her, that we are always nearer to bad fortune, than to good; but you must
confess unto me withal, that until such time as Soliman has refused us the
liberty which I am to ask of him, you have not so much cause to be
melancholic, as you had when I parted for Persia. The event of the war was
doubtful; it might have been long; I might have been beaten; I might have dyed
there; and since none of these has happened, and that I may justly demand my
liberty for a recompense, why do I, Madam, see more signs of grief in your
mind, than when we had all to fear, and nothing to hope for? The Princess not
answering precisely to Jbrahim, began to make him partake her unquietness. He
believed then that he was more unhappy than he thought he was; and suddenly
calling to mind the change which he had noted in Solimans face, he no longer
doubted but that there was something which Isabella d^d not tell him. What
accident, said he unto her, Madam, is befallen us? Has fortune invented some
new torment to persecute us withal? Speak I earnestly beseech you, and
whatsoever it may be, be pleased to let me know it. Jsabella would then have
put him off, with assuring him that she had no new matter to acquaint him with;
but the more she stood off, the more unquietness she gave him: Wherefore he
began to cast in his mind what the mischief might be, which would not be told
him; Has any one, said he unto her, wronged you during my absence? has any
body conspired against your life? has the hate which Roxelana bears me,
carried her to seek the means to hurt you? would she have sacrifised you to her
revenge, as she has sacrifised Prince Mustapha to her rage? would they have
forced you to change your Religion? has Rustan plotted any thing against me?
and (that which would be my last misery, and which I think cannot possibly be)
is Soliman become my Rival, or mine Enemy? The Princess thereupon not able to
retain her tears, put her hand before her eyes to conceal them from Ibrahim.
Ah! Madam, said he unto her then, gently pulling down her arm, do you answer me
with tears? can it be possible, that this Prince should hate me, or love you
too much? leave me not long in pain, and I beseech you, Madam, express your
self more clearly. I would I could draw you out of it, answered the Princess
still weeping, but since I cannot conceal that from you, which I have been
commanded not to let you know, and that my tears have betrayed me, believe what
they have told you, for it is but too true, and save me the labor of using any
longer discourse to you on so strange a subject. What, cried out Jbrahim then,
wholly transported with grief, does Soliman love you! He has told me so,
replied she, and in such a manne^, as makes me look upon death as the only
remedy that is left us to avoid his fury. After this, Jbrahim having in an
instant exactly run over all that the Grand Signior had said to him, no longer
doubted of his unhappiness, and in th^s certainty he said all that a just
resentment could make one say in a like adventure. What, cried he out, this
Prince, who is so great, so generous; who has loved me so tenderly; and who
has seen me ready to dye, because I was absent from the incomparable Isabella,
will he ravish her from me for ever; and stab a dagger into the heart of a man,
that has hazarded his life for his glory, and that had committed this
illustrious person to his protection! after this, said he to Isabella, I will
no longer trust my self; I believe, Madam, that I can betray you; I believe
that I can abandon you; and that I can be your enemy; since the greatest Prince
of the earth has been capable of violating the law of Nations, as well as
natural equity; of betraying the friendship which he had promised me; of
forgetting the services which I have done for him; of despising virtue; of not
harkning to reason; and of blemishing his own glory with an unjust passion.
But, Madam, added he, I am too blame my self, and I am the cause of your
misery: for why should not I fear any thing from a Prince, who had dipped his
hands in the blood of his son for an unjust love? he that had been capable of
so cruel a thought, might easily forget the respect which he owed to your
virtue; and I am not excusable for abandoning you. It is no time to speak of
that which is past, said the Princess unto him, but to think of that which is
to come. Ibrahim was not for all that in an estate to give counsel, for his
mind was filled with so many several thoughts, as he scarcely understood
what Isabella said unto him. He was possessed with grief, anger, and
repentance; hatred and jelousie had also some place in his soul; nevertheless
in the midst of his transports, and although the interest of Isabella prevailed
over all others, yet had he loved Soliman so much, that there were some
instants, wherein without considering Isabella, and without considering
himself, he was afflicted for that this Prince had given this blemish to his
life. But when as he surprised himself in this thought, he repented of it, as
of a crime, and reentred into his former fury. At length, after that Isabella
and he had said all that their grief and affection could suggest, and that the
Princess had related to Ibrahim all that she believed was necessary he should
know, the better to advise on that which they had to do, they found that their
reason was too much troubled, and they themselves too much interessed in the
business in question, for to judge soundly thereof. They resolved then to call
unto this counsel, both their he and she friends; to the end that all of them
together might seek out the means to avoid the mischief that menaced them.
Isabella for that effect willed Emilia to call them, and the French Marquis
taking this employment upon him, brought this fair troup a little after into
the Princess chamber, who with tears in her eyes craved pardon of her deer
friends, for having made a secret to them of a thing, which she would fain have
concealed from her self; and then, having recounted the estate wherein she was
with Soliman, she filled their hearts with grief, both for the interest which
they had in her fortune, and for their own; knowing very well that their
liberty depended on Ibrahim and Isabella, who being at odds themselves with
Soliman, were not like to obtain that for others, which they could not obtain
for themselves. This misery then being common, they all fell to think of what
might be done. Some would have Ibrahim, without testifying any knowledge of
this unjust love, pursue his first design, and demand his liberty of Soliman,
because, said they, it may be that this Prince being ashamed of his fault, and
incensed with Isabellas constancy, will grant him his request, and resolve to
deprive himself of the sight of a man whom he can no longer look upon but with
confusion, and of a person, whom it is impossible for him to conquer. But
Ibrahim opposed this opinion; for whereas he knew Soliman full well, he was
sure that love being once entered into his heart, would never go out of it
again but with violence; and that he could not be capable of repenting, but
when as the crimes which love made him commit, were far greater than his
passion. Then it was propounded, that no resolution should be taken, till the
eight days, which Soliman had given Isabella to make her answer in, were
expired; because the sight of Ibrahim it might be had revived the friendship
which he bore him, and had banished, or dimished the love which he carried to
her. But if Ibrahim was opposite to the first advice that was given, the
Princess said that she would never consent to this second: for in conclusion,
said she, after that which Soliman has spoken to me, there are but two
remidies to be chosen, either death or flight. The last is the best, replied
the Marquis, and if I may be believed, it shall be the only thing we will think
of. This advise having been found the surest and the easiest, there was nothing
more thought of, than of seeking out the means to execute it. It was not
because Ibrahim did not upon the first apprehension of it follow this opinion
with repugnancy, but because he was persuaded, that a Prince, who committed so
great an infidelity against him, could not complain of him with reason for his
going out of his Empire without his consent. In this thought he considered with
the rest, which way they might draw themselves out of captivity; in the end the
resolution was, that Ibrahim, being able to do what he would, should secretly
assure himself of a vessel; and that until it was ready to part, he should
see Soliman as often as possible he could, and take great care to keep him
from suspecting that Isabella had spoken to him of his love to her. The rest of
the day being spent in this sort, the next morning the Grand Vizier having
understood that there was a Christian Vessel which was to set sail the day
ensuing, wrought in such manner as he absolutely assured himself of her; and
without any bodies being aware of it, he caused a great many Christian slaves,
which were newly delivered, to enter into her. After he had taken this order,
he went to see Soliman again, but it was with so much repugnancie, as it fell
out well for him that he did not see him; it being most certain, that whereas
he was not accustomed to disguise his thoughts, it would have been impossible
for him not to have testified somewhat of that which he had in his heart. When
he arrived at the Seraglio, he was told that the Grand Signior was at the
Sultana Queens lodging; and whereas it was the only place in the outward
Seraglio, where Ibrahim entered not, he returned to his Palace; and there as
long as the day lasted, he received the visits of all the Bassaes, Beglerbeis,
and Sangiaes, that were at Constantinople. In the mean time Soliman was not
without unquietness, he would willingly have had Ibrahim always with him, to
keep him from being with Jsabella, and would willingly withal never have seen
him, since he could not do so without being ashamed of his fault; and indeed it
was out of this consideration that he was gone to the Sultanaes lodging, that
he might decline the sight of him. It was not because his mind was quieter in
that place than in another; for he carried his torment in his heart. His love,
Jsabellaes constancy, and Jbrahims return, possessed him with strange thoughts;
and in the disorder wherein his soul was, he made wishes against his own glory,
and would that Jbrahim had been beaten in Persia; that his Army had been
defeated; and that with a lavvafull pretext he could banish him from the Port,
and retain Jsabella. It was not because he knew not that his designs were
unjust, but it was because his passion was instead of reason to him, and made
him deal in this sort. Roxelana on her side was not in a little pain; she saw
Jsabella out of the Seraglio; and albeit the Slave, her confident, had assured
her, that Soliman had not changed his mind for this Princess, yet she feared
that seeing her no longer, and seeing Jbrahim, the love which he bare to
Jsabella would diminish, and that his good will to the Bassa would reassume
new forces. Howbeit she hoped that Jsabella would acquaint the Grand Vizier
with the love that the Sultan bore her; and that thereupon he would do
something which might give him opportunity to ruin him. In this belief an hour
after Jsabella was gone out of the Seraglio she sent to will Rustan that he
should carefully observe all Jbrahims actions by the same Slave which before
times had informed him of the Love that he carried to Jsabella. Rustan obeyed
her so exactly, that what care soever the Grand Vizier took to conceal his
design, yet did he suspect it. First he understood that the Bassa had enquired,
whether there were any Christian vessels in the Port that were to set sail in
a few days, and that he had been told that one was to part the night
follovving; he understood likewise by the Slave which was his confident, that
after all strangers were gone from him, he went into the Princesses chamber,
and that without heeding him he had said to her, that he came from receiving
the last visits of his Courtiers. This man told him also, that the Italian
Slave, in whom the Grand Vizier greatly confided, seemed to be very busy; as
indeed it was he, who had in charge to see that the vessel was made ready to
set sail; and who by Jbrahims order had provided all things necessary for their
departure. Rustan having received this advice, just as it was night, let not
for all that to go to the Seraglio, to advertise Roxelana of it; but whereas it
was an unseasonable hour, he was constrained to give to a Capigibassi a Letter
which he had written in case he could not speak with her. Roxelana had no
sooner received it, but she went her self without further consulting to
acquaint Soliman with what Rustan had certified; and whereas this Prince,
blinded by his passion, sought but for a pretext to complain of Jbrahim, he
hearkened to her with a great deal of impatience, which Roxelana having
observed, she made use of the occasion, and told him, how she had a long time
known that Jbrahim favored the Christians; that without doubt he had some
hidden design, which could not be comprehended; and adding yet more to that
which Rustan had written, she so wrought, that Soliman, to be cleared in the
business, resolved to send to Jbrahims Palace for him. And whereas there was no
body about him whom he judged fit for it, Roxelana having propounded Rustan
unto him, who she said was at the gate of the Seraglio, he consented thereunto;
and having caused him to enter, the Sultan commanded him to go to Jbrahims
Palace, and will him to come presently to him. For Soliman doubted not, if it
were true that he had caused a vessel to be made ready, but that it was for
Jsabella, or for his friends; and that so, which soever it were, he should have
(according to the mind he was in) a just occasion to ruin Jbrahim. But Rustan
was not like to find him at home; for as soon as it was night, he had caused
Jsabella, Sophronia, Hipolita, Leonida, Emilia, with the rest of their troup to
go secretly out of his Palace; and he himself had got out after them thorough a
door of his Garden, which was toward the Port, to embarque himself in that
vessel which he had made to be prepared, and whereof the Captain and the Pilot
were absolutely his, by means of the money which he had caused to be given to
them. Before his departure he had written a Letter to Soliman, and had left it
with one of his servants, with order, that if any one came to ask for him from
the Grand Signior, to deliver it unto him; so that Rustan arriving at his
house, found him not. It was in vain that he enquired after him, and what care
soever he took for it, he could learn no other, than that he was not in his
Palace; that Jsabella, his friends, and her friends, were not there neither;
and that he had left a Letter for the Grand Signior. Rustan having taken it,
sent to the Port to learn whether any vessel had set sail, and then went in
all have to the Sultan, to acquaint him with Jbrahims flight, and present him
with the Letter which he had written to him; for he durst not conceal it,
though gladly he would, because many had seen it delivered to him. My Lord,
said he when he was come unto him, Jbrahim is no longer at Constantinople. This
speech amazed Soliman; but when he knew that Jsabella was out of his power he
felt a redoubling of love, jealousy, anger, hatred, despair, and fury. And
when as Rustan had given him Jbrahims Letter, he broke up the seal with
violence, and not knowing whethe^ he should read or tear it, he stood a pretty
while without speaking; but at length carried by his curiosity, or rather by
his passion, he opened it sighing, and found that it was thus.

Ibrahims Letter to Soliman.
HEaven be my witness, whether J could not more easily resolve to quit my life,
than go out of thy Empire, without taking leave of thy Higbness, were J not
forced thereunto, both by an interest of honor, and by a sense of love. Thou
know too well how exactly J have kept my word with thee, in coming to take
my former chains upon me again, for thee to suspect J would commita fault
lightly. J could in consideration of thy Highness, quit Isabella at Monaco, but
J confess that J could not abandon her at Constantinople. In fine, my Lord, to
excuse my fault, consider what love has made thee do; this passion has made
thee forget the friendship which thou had promised me; it has carried thee
to hate me, it has constrained thee to banish reason from thy soul, and no
longer to remember, that this Ibrahim from whom thou would take away his
life, in taking Isabella from him, is the same who in times past quitted
Isabella for the love of thee, and who would dye with joy for thy service. Thou
see then, my Lord, to what this passion has carried thee, in regard whereof
excuse that which it compels me to do. J do not fly from Soliman, but from the
passion which masters him; and without complaining of him, I accuse the beauty
of Isabella; and J part away the unhappiest man that is, because J cannot do so
without displeasing thy Highness.

Justiniano.


Soliman nothing moved with this Letter, tore it after he had read it; and the
confusion which it brought to his soul, instead of begetting repentance,
augmented his fury the more. Let this ungrateful wretch, said he to Rustan, be
pursued, and let all that is possible be done to return him into my power.
Roxelana entering hereupon into Solimans chamber, from whence she had gone a
little after Rustans departure, and perceiving his mind to be in the terms
wherein she had long desired to have it, provoked his anger yet more; and
propounded unto him the employing of Rustan in the pursuit of Jbrahim: But that
which she thought cunningly to do succeeded not with her; her intention was so
to use the matter, as Rustan should not find Jbrahim: For whereas her interest
was, that he should no longer have power, nor be longer at the Port, she feared
if he should be brought back again, that she should not oblige Soliman to ruin
him uttetly; and so he might return into grace again. Howbeit this design was
not executed; for besides that she could not speak with Rustan in private, the
Grand Signior so absolutely commanded him to bring him back Ibrahim and
Jsabella, or never to return, as she was constrained to let him go without
saying any thing to him. He went then in all have to take a Galley to pursue
him, because he had understood from him whom he had sent to the Port, that a
Christian vessel had set sail by the Grand Visiers order a little before. He
imbarqued himself then with all the speed that possibly he could; and not
doubting but that he took the way of the Archipelago, he made his Pilot hold
the same course. In the mean time Soliman was not without unquietness; the
privation of a good which he ardently desired, made him regard it as a thing
yet more precious; Isabella appeared to him more amiable than ever he had seen
her; yea he believed that it may be he might one day have won her heart; and in
this belief he was infinitely afflicted. He looked upon Jbrahim with hatred,
and this Prince was so unjust, as no longer to remember either his merit, his
courage, or the friendship he had born him; nor to consider him in this
occasion but as his Rival, and as a man who had stolen a person from him, of
whom he was infinitely amorous. In this unjust thought he termed him
ungrateful, he called him ravisher, unfaithful, and perfideous; and thinking
of nothing but how to find out means to ruin him, out of a sense of jealousy
he said, Were I sure that I should never touch the heart of Jsabella, yet I
shall always have this advantage, if they be brought back to me again, that I
can separate them for ever; and I shall at leastwise have this satisfaction,
that if Jsabelln be not mine, she shall never be any bodies else. Whilst
Soliman was incensing his fury and his rage, Jsabella and tha^ dear troup,
which she loved so much, were already thinking of giving thanks to Heaven for
their deliverance. For whereas they had embarked themselves at the beginning
of the night, they believed that when their flight came the next day to be
known, they should be then far enough off from being taken any more: So that
Jsabellaes mind was quiet enough; and the hope of being soon out of the Grand
Signiors power, entertained her so agreeably, as fear had scarcely any place in
her soul. Her friends began also to be no longer afraid of Soliman, and to be
in doubt of nothing but Pirates and Tempests. Doria, Horatio, and Alphonso
prepared themselves for all that might happen with constancy enough; the French
Marquis began already to talk according to his accustomed humor; when as
Justiniano, who was not so well assured of his good fortune, but that he had as
much fear as hope, began to cry out that they were pursued, and that he saw a
Galley which made toward them amain: Indeed he discovered Rustans Galley, even
as they were near to that strait where the two Castles of Sestos and Abydus are
situated, which the Turks at this day call Dardanelli. Justiniano, having seen
this Galley, turned himself to Jsabella, and asked her whether she would not
permit him to dye in defending her? Your death, said she unto him him, I may
not endure; but that excepted, I will consent to any thing rather than to fall
again into the hands of Soliman. After this discourse, Justiniano and his
friends began to prepare themselves for defense; and though he had but few men,
for to carry the business the more secretly he durst bring no more, yet were
they not easy to be vanquished; for as well slaves as Merchants were
sufficiently obliged to fight; and the others had not only their lives and
liberties to defend, but their Sisters and their Mistrisses too. On the other
part Rustan knowing that this vessel was the same which he sought for, and
fearing that the Christian slaves which were in his Galley would not row
speedily enough, he promised them their liberty, if they employed all their
force in this occasion, and that by their means he might stay Ibrahim; so that
carried by this hope, and without inquiring whether those which they would take
were Turks or Christians, they rowed with so much vigor, as in a little time
his Galley was within Cannon shot of Ibrahims Vessel. And to keep him from
flying, he discharged a piece of Ordnance, to advertise them that were of the
Guard in the Castles of Sestos and Abidus, that enemies vessels were in that
place. This device failed not to work the expected effect; for Ibrahim knowing
that there were on both sides of this straight forty pieces of Ordnance planted
even with the water, which without doubt would after this signal discharge
upon him if he attempted to pass, found himself strangely troubled. For of one
side he feared lest he should see Isabella carried away with a Cannon-shot; on
the other, Rustans violence was little less terrible to him; and in this
unquietness he commanded his Pilot to do one thing, and by and by unsayed it
again. Isabella would have had them expose themselves rather to the fury of the
Cannon, than to fight with Rustan; but they were not long in an estate to
choose what they had to do; for this Galley which pursued them having
overtaken them, and spite of their utmost endeavors to the contrary having
grapled her self to them, Ibrahim, followed by his friends, performed such
things in this occasion, as surpassed the valor of the most illustrious
Heroes. He wounded Rustan with his own hand; all those that presented
themselves against him, fell presently dead, either at his feet, or into the
Sea. All Rustans soldiers fled from his encounter, and chose rather to set
upon ten others, than defend themselves from him alone. In the mean time fresh
succor came to Rustan; for they of the two Castles of Sestos and Abidus,
hearing the piece which he had caused to be shot off, came in Frigots with a
great number of soldiers to see what the matter was; and finding a Christian
Vessel set upon by Turks, they never inquired further, but joined with them;
and Ibrahim seeing his enemies redoubled, redoubled his courage too. One would
have said that he had recovered new forces; he past from one place to another
in an instant; he maintained his own men, assaulted his enemies, and fighting
desperately, yet without losing his judgment, he might peradventure have
wearied and vanquished them that assaulted him, had not Rustan, whilst he was
busy in defending himself from fix which fought with him together, bethought
him of a wile, which alone made him victor. He went with some soldiers to the
Captains Cabin, with his Scymitar in his hand, where the Princess and her dear
friends, were more dead than alive, in attending the event of the fight. When
first he entered, Isabella gave a great skriek; but this cruel man, without
harkening to her complaints, drawing her with one hand, and holding his
Scymitar in the other, pulled her to the Cabbin-door, and calling to Ibrahim,
who turned his head that way, Resolve thy self, said he unto him, to render up
thy arms, or if thou do it not, to see the head of her I hold here taken from
her shoulders. This dreadful speech made Ibrahim stop a little, during the
which Jsabella without daunting, prayed him not to yield for to keep her from
death, seeing she desired it. But Jbrahim being about to advance toward
Rustan, and seeing him lift up his arm to strike Isabella, hold said he unto
him, throwing down his arms, and tendering his hands to them that environed him;
spare the life of this person, since I did not fight but to preserve it; set
her free, and make me a slave; and if I may obtain this of thee, I will not
complain of thy cruelty. Alas! cried Jsabella then, the laying of you in irons
is not giving me liberty, nor is the putting your life in the power of your
enemies, the preserving of mine! In the mean time Doria, Alphonso, Horatio, and
the French Marquis were still endeavoring to do their uttermost; but Jbrahim
fearing lest some outrage should be done to Jsabella, cried to them to render
themselves, which they were constrained to do; for Jbrahim fighting no longer,
and being laden with chains by Rustans commandment, they had all the enemies
upon them; so that fight how they could, number prevailed over valor, and
Rustan made himself Master of the Vessel, and of the persons whom he sought
for; and having forced them to pass into his Galley he returned to
Constantinople. These unfortunate ones had yet the consolation to make this
voyage together without being separated; for Rustan, busied about stopping the
blood which he lost at the wound he had received, had not the inhumanity to
keep them from talking together. Jbrahim was likewise as well as Horatio,
Alphonso, Doria, and the French Marquis, laden with chains, which had been
knocked off from some of those slaves, who had been the cause of their taking
by rowing with such speed. Jsabella and her friends, being with them, and not
able to succor them, augmented their torments yet more with the extreme
affliction that appeared in them. Alas! said Jsabella to Jbrahim, if I were
sure that death would be the greatest misery that can arrive unto me in the
place whither we are going, I should easily comfort my self; yea and I should
regard it as an happiness rather than a misfortune: but the cruelty of our
enemies will not stay there; for whereas Soliman knows that I fear neither
torments nor death, he will make me suffer in your person, and that makes up
all my grief. Fear not for me, said Jbrahim unto her, but only think of
preserving your self: Soliman loves you, labor then to move his heart rather
than to incense it, and be confident that death cannot be grievous to me, if I
were assured of your life. No, no, answered Jsabella, this is not the way I
mean to hold, and you would blame me without doubt if I should follow your
counsel: I will die as well as you, and if my prayers can obtain any thing of
Soliman, it shall be that we may die together. Augment not my torments, replied
the Illustrious Bassa, and speak not of your death, if you will not have me
advance mine; live, my dear Jsabella, and let me alone perish. I live, cried
Jsabella? Ah! no, no, Jsabella knows not how to survive her glory, and
Justiniano, which are the only things that can make her life agreeable, and
without the which she will not preserve it. I may, added she, live unhappy,
unfortunate, laden with chains, exiled from my country, without means, and
without liberty; but I cannot live without honor, and without Justiniano; so
that if Soliman will ravish me of my glory, and bereave me of the only person
that I love, I shall not waver between death and life; and I know what co^rse I
am to take. Ah! too generous Isabella, cried Ibrahim then; why have I loved
you, to cause you to fall into so many miseries? Why have I not always been
your enemy, to keep you from having such cruel ones? But what say I, senseless
man, continued he, I merit the torments which I suffer, if I can repent me of
having loved you: No, Madam, I cannot do it; I would that my death might
hinder yours, I would that I might endure all things for you, but I cannot wish
that I could not adore you. That wish would be unjust, replied she, and would
questionless do great wrong to our affection; which is not the cause of our
misfo^tunes; it is two pure, and too innocent, to be punished for a crime: and
the only thing which comforts me in our miseries, is the belief I am in, that
we do not deserve them; and that Heaven sends them to us, rather to try our
virtue, than to correct our faults. But added she, before we are separated (as
without doubt we shall be) promise me, that what artifice soever our enemies
may use to persuade you unto any thing to my disadvantage, you will never
believe it. For hold it for most assured, that Isabella will dye a thousand
times, rather than do any thing unworthy of her virtue, and yours. Let me then
have the satisfaction to hope, that the malice of our persecutors shall make
you believe nothing to my prejudice. Ah! Madam, cried Ibrahim, it is for me to
demand this favor of you; for whereas I have not rendered you so many marks of
my affection, as I have received from your virtue, you may the more easily
doubt of it. But believe, Madam, that I will dye adoring you; and if the loss
of my life may oblige Soliman to restore you to your liberty, as I purpose to
beseech it of him, I shall dye even with pleasure. Let us not separate our
destinies, anfwered the Princess; either let us live together, or let us dye
together. After so sad a discourse, the excess of their affection forced them
to hold their peace; and their displeasure being shut up in their heart, they
felt it more vively than they did, whom as they eased themselves with their
complaints. The unhappiness of the persons which were engaged in their
misfortune afflicted them the more; and they saw all about them so many
occasions of despair, as it might be said, that never was the virtue of a
person put to so hard a trial. Hipolita, Sophronia, Emilia, and Leonida, were
wholly dissolved into tears; Alphonso, Doria, Horatio, and the French Marquis,
were also infinitely afflicted: and if Rustan could have been touched with any
compassion, he had been doubtless with so lamentable an object. But far from
having any humanity for another, he was cruel to himself; for though he were
wounded, yet the desire which he had to destroy Ibrahim, and to finish a thing
which he had so well begun, made him in stead of repayring to his house to look
to his wound, to go directly to the Serraglio as soon as he arrived at
Constantinople, and to behave himself so as if he had not been hurt at all.
Presently upon his landing, he sent to advertise Soliman of his return, and of
the success of his voyage. And whereas this Prince had increased his fury with
his solitariness, he instantly commanded, that Ibrahim and Isabella should be
brought into the Seraglio, and put into several places with a sure guard; and
that all those which had followed them should be put likewise into another
place. Never was so deplorable a thing seen, as the execution of this
commandment; Isabella would not quit Ibrahim, he too would not abandon her; and
though they had well enough foreseen that they should be separated, yet could
they not for all that consent thereunto. Their friends likewise would not leave
them, and if Soliman could have been a spectator of so sad a conversation, he
might peradventure have been moved to pity. But at length Ibrahim and
Isabella, being constrained to resolve for that which they could not avoid,
took their farewell of each other, as persons that were never to see one another
again; and following each other with their eyes as far as they could, they
swore unto themselves to dye loving one another as faithfully as they had
mutually promised. After Rustan had conducted Ibrahim to one quarter of the
Seraglio, caused Isabella to be carried to another, and their friends to a
third, he went to Soliman, whose mind had never been quiet, since he knew the
success of his voyage. For seeing Jbrahim and Jsabella in his hands, he
scarcely knew what resolution to take; for in the estate wherein things were,
he must destroy the Bassa, or render him his Mistress. Regarding him as the
Lover of Jsabella, he desired his death; considering him as a fugitive, he
sound it just; but remembering the affection which he had born him, he had much
ado to resolve to destroy him. What shall I do, said he to himself, with this
ungrateful creature, who after so many favors which he has received from me,
so many honors which I have conferred on him, so many marks which I have
rendered him of my good will, goes out of my Empire without my leave? This
perfidious man, cried he, should have considered methinks, how I had
heretofore broken his chains to share my Empire with him, and how he to whom he
owed his life and his liberty, ought to have obliged him to a more exact
fidelity. But this wretch preferring the possession of a woman before the
greatness wherein I had set him, and my friendship, quits and abandons me; and
not content to steal a person from me whom I love, and without whom I cannot
live, he gets him away it may be with intelligences that he has in my Empire
to make war upon me, and to recover from me that which he says appertains unto
him: But he was never of the Race of the Paleologues; And then, continued he,
if he could persuade me to it, that would be yet a further reason to oblige me
to destroy him. It behooves he should die out of reason of State, as I pretend
he shall die out of reason of Love. If I regard him as a slave, I have power
over his life, since every slave that breaks his irons deserves to lose it. If
I regard him as my subject, he is worthy of death for going out of my Empire
without my consent. If I regard him as a Christian, I cannot hate him enough;
and if I consider him as an Enemy-Prince, it behooves he should die, that the
end of his life may make an end of settling my Throne to my successors. Soliman
having, as it seemed to him, settled his resolution firmly enough, felt some
rest in his mind. Howbeit suddenly some beam of light coming to him again, he
was ashamed of his own thoughts; yet would he not oppose them, but rather
sought how he might fortify them; nevertheless there was one thing that
retained his fury for a while: Suppose, said he, that I resolve to destroy
Jbrahim; that he be already punished for his ingratitude and perfidiousness;
that the end of his life has ended the love which he bears to Jsabella; let us
see after this, whether in thinking to do our self service, we do not hurt our
self: For can she love a Prince, who bereaves her of the person that is dearest
to her in the world? But can she, continued he, love any other than Ibrahim, as
long as he is living? No, no, said he raising his voice, it behooves he should
dye; and I shall always have this consolation, that if she love not me, she
shall at leastwise love nothing in the world. But (cried he again, after he had
continued a while without speaking) he whom I will destroy, is the same Jbrahim
who has done me such important service, and whom I have so much loved;
howbeit, continued he, it is Jsabellaes Lover; it is a fugitive slave; it is a
revolted subject; it is a Prince my enemy; or it may be an impostor. In such
like thoughts as these was the Grand Signior, when as Rustan came to him, who
out of his malice carried him to further violence against Jbrahim, by forging
matters, which he affirmed he had heard him speak against him. Presently
thereupon Roxelana entered, who, making as if she did not know, that there was
any interest of love in the hatred which Soliman bore to Jbrahim, spoke not but
of the good of the State, and of the glory of the Empire. She represented to
Soliman, how mightily he had always protected the Christians in all occasions
that had been presented; as indeed she lied not. But although the most part of
those things were done by Solimans consent in the favor of Jbrahim, yet was
this Prince so unjust, as to hearken to this accusation, as if he had been
acquainted with new crimes. After then that this wicked woman had made him
resolve to put Jbrahim to death, she told him moreover, that if have were not
made to take away his life, the people undoubtedly would rise to save him; for,
said she, out of the design which he h^th had to usurp the Empire, he has
always taken great care to make himself to be beloved of them. Soliman seeing
himself upon the point of absolutely resolving the matter, felt a new combat in
his heart; love, hatred, jealousy, friendship, shame, and glory, did their
last and uttermost endeavor to vanquish one another; but at length virtue was
surmounted in this occasion by the wickedness of Roxalana and Rustan: And
Soliman consented that without further delay he should go and execute this
fatal sentence, which their hatred, rather than he, pronounced against the
illustrious Jbrahim. Away he went with a great deal of speed, for fear lest the
Sultan should alter his mind. Nevertheless not daring wholly to fall in the
usual form, he sent for Jbrahim to come to supper; and this perfidious wretch,
who feared a revolt, kept all that were in the Seraglio from going forth. In
the mean time Jbrahim being set at table as the rest, Rustan in the midst of
the meal presented him with a robe of black velvet, which was an undoubted
mark, that the end of this fatal feast should be the end of his life: For after
this manner is the news of death denounced to persons of quality, that are to
lose their lives in the Seraglio. Jbrahim seeing his ruin certain, received
this robe for all that with a great deal of constancy. And whereas it was
presented to him by Rustan, because no body else would tender him this strange
present; I receive it, said he unto him, without fearing the death which it
presageth, and without being any whit surprised therewith, knowing full well
that it is a dependence of the charge which I have possessed, and that few Grand
Visiers have dyed otherways: But I receive it with grief, because it
blemisheth the glory of a Prince whom I have loved, and for that it is offered
to me by the hand of Rustan. This ceremony much afflicted all them that saw it;
yet did not Ibrahim rise til the time which custom requires in such like
occasions was past; nor forbear talking to some Officers of the Empire, which
were at this fatal supper by Rustans order in the grand Signiors name; for he
feared if they should have gone forth, and acquainted the people, that Ibrahim
was going to be put to death, they would have risen before he had been
executed. And truly this design was not amiss; for whereas Ibrahim was
infinitely beloved, their eyes were all bedewed with tears, and certainly had
they had arms, they would have attempted to succor him, or at leastwise would
have lost themselves with him. Never was there a more deplorable feast than
this same; none that were present at it did eat any thing; they seemed all to
be condemned to death; and Ibrahim only testified by the tranquillity of his
countenance, and by his constancy, that he was in case to comfort the rest.
Four mutes, which were to strangle him, stood before him, with each of them a
black silk bow-string in his hand, which was to serve for that deadly office.
Now though this object possessed all those that considered it, with terror and
pity, Ibrahim seemed no more sensible of fear, than Rustan was of compassion.
This Illustrious Bassa was seen with an admirable tranquillity, and with a
constancy without affectation; he endured his misery without murmuring; he
beheld the tears of others, without shedding any; and if any sign of sadness
appeared in his face, the interest of Isabella alone was the cause of it; and
indeed this thought made him suffer very much. The regret of being separated
from her; the uncertainty of what should become of her after his death, which
was scarcely irksom unto him, but for the grief which Isabella would take at
it, replenished him with heavy thoughts. Whilst he was in this estate; whilst
he attended the time of his execution; and whilst he was preparing to entreat
some of them that were about him, to say something to Soliman for the
preservation of Isabella, the Sultan was not without unquietness; Roxelana, who
had still remained with him, had not only kept his mind from inclining to
compassion, but contrarily had so incensed it, as he many times seemed to be
very impatient, for that he could not receive news of Ibrahims death.
Nevertheless he had no sooner had such a like thought, but straightway he was
of another opinion: He would have a thing, and he would not have it; and in
this incertainty his imagination represented unto him all Jbrahims whole life.
He sought not for all that to remember the friendship which he had born him,
and the marks which he had given him of it, but to hate him the more. This
ungrateful man, said he, could not resolve to comply with a Prince, who would
have given him his daughter in marriage; who would have allied himself to him;
and who, besides yielding up his Throne to him, has done all things for him.
This remembrance wrought a strange effect in Soliman; he suddenly changed
color, and after he had mused a little, as it were to call something to his
memory, he cried out with strange precipitation, to have Rustan fetched back
again, and looking about him, the matter is at an end, said he, wholly
transported with fury; I cannot destroy mine enemy; he must live, since I have
sworn it; let one go with all speed, said he, to some of his attendants, and
revoke the sentence which I have given; but no delay must be made, for
otherwise I shall draw the heavy wrath of heaven upon my head. Roxelana,
surprised with this discourse, would have kept them from obeying the grand
Signior, until she knew from whence this mutation came. But having commanded a
second time, that one should go and do that which he had ordained, she was
compelled to consent unto it. What so sudden a change, said she unto him, is
arrived in thy Highness mind? is it possible that Soliman, whom I have heard an
hundred times say, that repentance is a weakness, whereof he was not capable,
should at length be possessed with it at this present? No, said Soliman to her,
I do not repent, but contrariwise that I may not repent, and that I may keep my
word, I am carried to that which I do. The Sultana having obliged him to
explain himself more clearly, he informed her, how as he was laboring to
remember the obligations wherein Ibrahim was engaged to him, to the end he
might detest his ingratitude so much the more, his memory had represented unto
him, how he would once have given him the Sultana Asteria to wife, and how at
the same time, and on the same day, to secure Ibrahim from the fear which he
seemed to have of the change of his fortune, he had sworn to him by Alla, that
as long as he lived he should not die a violent death. After this, said he to
her, Never ask me what has made me alter my mind: I do not repent, I would
still have Jbrahim destroyed, but being unable to put him to death without
violating violating my Oath; I must no longer think of it; mine Enemy must
live; I must not be revenged; and all this is, because I my self have tied the
hand, which should strike a dagger into his heart.

The Sultana, who was not so scrupulous as Soliman, nor made so exact a
profession of keeping her word, did what she could to persuade him not to keep
his. No, said he unto her, I may not fail in it; and had I promised my Empire
and my Liberty, I should descend from my Throne, and put on the Irons my self
which I was to wear. Ibrahim must live, since I have promised it; I have sworn
by ALLA, and that is to say all that can be said. I should draw down the wrath
of Heaven upon me; and I should do that which I have never done, if I should do
otherwise. I have observed all that ever I have promised in my life, even
without an Oath; having then sworn so solemnly, I may by no means break it. I
should destroy mine enemy, but thereby I should bring one into my heart, that
would persecute me eternally; and repentance, which is a motion unknown to me,
would without doubt find place in my Soul. At length after a long contestation,
Roxelana persuaded Soliman, to take the advice of the Muphti, who she knew was
absolutely hers, as having gotten him the place which he held during Ibrahim's
absence. And albeit Soliman did not think that this man could find out any
thing that would satisfy him, yet he sent for him. When he was come, and that
Roxelana, in propounding the matter unto him, had dexterously signified to him
that she desired the death of Ibrahim; this man, who naturally had wit, malice,
and cunning, was nevertheless sufficiently troubled to answer precisely unto
that which was demanded of him for the contenting of Roxelana. He said then
that this affair was not to be spoken of precipitously; and having required an
hours time to think of it, after he had caused Soliman to repeat unto him the
very same words, which he had before-time used to Ibrahim, he fell deeply a
musing: But he was not long in searching out that which he did not think to
find; My Lord, said he to Soliman, the Prophet, whom we worship, has no doubt
inspired me with that which I am going to tell thy Highness, that thou may be
able to punish him whom thou would destroy. And when as Soliman had asked him
how he thought to perform that which he said, he obliged him to repeat once
more unto him the promise which he had made to Ibrahim. I remember it but too
well, answered the Sultan, and lo the very words which I spoke. Remember (said
I unto him) how I swear unto thee by ALLA, that as long as Soliman lives, thou
shall not dye a violent death. This suffices, replied the Muphti, for, my
Lord, to express my thought to thy Highness; is it not true, that the promise,
which thou have made to Ibrahim, is a thing which cannot secure him but only
during thy life? and is it not certain, that thy Successors should not be
obliged to preserve him? It being so, my Lord, said he unto him, it will not be
hard for me to content thee. For thy Highness having promised Ibrahim, that he
shall not dye a violent death, as long as Soliman lives; if I can make it
appear to thee, that there are every day some hours, wherein Soliman does not
live, it will appear to thee by the same reason, that during the said time
Ibrahim may dye, without breaking of thy Highness word.

The Sultan hearing him speak thus, believed that this man knew not very well
what he would say; but the other nothing daunted, and speaking to him with as
much confidence, as if he had been inspired from Heaven; My Lord, said he unto
him, it is a matter whereof no body is ignorant, that Sleep is called the
brother of Death by all Nations, and in all Languages; and truly it is not
without cause that he is termed so, it being certain, that a man which is
asleep cannot with reason be said to be living, since we see that he is
deprived of all the functions of a reasonable life, which alone is the life of
man: I confess indeed how in that estate he still enjoys the life of plants,
but not that of man, which consists not but in the use of Reason, whereof he is
wholly bereft in that estate. Sleep equals Kings and Shepherds as well as
Death, the stupid and the witty, the happy and the unhappy, good men and bad;
and there is no difference seen between them, but that sleep is a short death,
and death an eternal sleep. Wherefore it being evident, that a man asleep
cannot (to speak reasonably) be said to be living, I conclude from thence, that
thy Highness, without breaking thy word, may take away Ibrahim's life when as
sleep has thoroughly benumbed thy sense and Reason. Roxelana failed not to
approve of this advice, and maintained that he had spoken judiciously. But for
Soliman, he yielded not with so much facility; he made many objections to the
Muphti, whereunto he still answered, with as much cunning as wickedness.

Thus, although this Prince had a very piercing wit in all other things, yet
the desire which he had to make away Ibrahim, persuaded him that the Muphti had
Reason; and that he might put the grand Vizier to death when he was asl^ep.
For, this wicked man said to him, thy Highness has not absolutely promised
him, not to put him to death, but only, that he should not dye a violent death,
as long as Soliman lives, and Soliman shall not live, when as the Bassa shall
dye. This design being concluded, it was resolved, that they should tarry till
night was come for the executing of it. For whereas sleep is not a voluntary
act, they thought it requisite to attend till the time of sleep was come.

In the mean season Ibrahim had been brought back to the place which served him
for a prison, not knowing whether grace would be showed him, or whether his
execution was but deferred. This incertainty was almost as displeasing, as the
assurance of an approaching death had been grievous to him; yet did he not ask
any thing that regarded himself directly, but only enquired after Isabella, who
on her part was not without a world of grief. She had understood, that Ibrahim
had been lead to a place, where oftentimes the grand Visiers had been deprived
of their lives, and that made her to be as much afflicted, as if she had
already seen him breathe out his last. It may be, said she, that now whilst I
am speaking Justiniano is defending himself against his Executioners; it may be
he is yielding up his last breath, and is thinking of me once for all. Ah! if
it be so, cried she, I beseech Heaven at leastwise to spare me the affliction
that I may not hear of his loss, and by my death to keep me from the grief of
lamenting his. Howbeit I fear, said she, that my prayers will not be heard, and
that Soliman's cruelty will let me live to persecute me: But let him arm his
Executioners, let him invent torments, I will complain no more after this
sorrow; he that shall acquaint me with the loss of Justiniaeno, shall render me
insensible to all others. Alas! what say I? added she, it seems in hearing me
speak, that I will conserve my life after he shall be deprived of his; no, no,
Isabella will not survive Justiniano; and that which the rage of Soliman will
not do, grief alone shall execute: Let this unjust Prince do what he will, I
hope, that I shall get out of his power, by getting out of my life; Heaven is
interessed in the prayer which I make unto it; I beg this grace of it to
preserve mine innocence; and if my despair be a fault, I hope it will pardon it
in regard of the greatness of my misfortune, of the purity of my affection, and
of mine own weakness.

In this deplorable estate, Isabella having understood, that Ibrahim had been
brought back to his quarter, hope began again to find some place in her Soul;
and she believed that Soliman having desired to see him, had peradventure been
moved to compassion: Sophronia, Hipolita, Leonida, Emilia, and the rest of
their Troop, which were in another place, had the same hope, hearing what had
past: But the matter went otherwise; for as soon as night was come, Rustan, who
wholly governed this deadly ceremony, went himself a second time to fetch
Ibrahim by the Grand Signior's Command. He led him then into the same Hall,
where formerly he had been; and having left him in the company of four mutes,
which were to strangle him, as soon as Soliman was asleep, he returned to this
Prince, who had at that time no greater a longing then to make away Ibrahim. As
for him, although he did not fear death, and was exceeding peaceable, yet had
his Soul great agitations. Ah, said he to himself, I shall never see Isabella
more I and I shall not only be deprived of her sight, but I shall abandon her
to the violence of a Prince, who I believed had been her Protector: and who it
may be, provoked by her virtue, will take away her life, as well as mine; for
since Soliman can consent to my death, he may well sign hers. Alas, continued
he, to what an estate am I reduced! If I wish that she should live, I make
wishes against her glory; I consent to the exposing of her to the rigor of a
violent and amorous Prince. I cannot wish her her life, without doing her
wrong; and then again, not only I cannot desire her death, but I cannot so much
as think of it, without a despair that is not to be parelled. If this Prince,
who is my Rival, could be her husband, I would make vows against my self, and I
love Isabella so much, as to be willing to save her life with the loss of all
my felicity. But as the case stands, she cannot be his, not only without
infidelity, not only without infamy, but with an horrible crime. Alas! added
he, if it were not so, my loss should not be without comfort; loving me as she
does, she would live without pleasure, but also without shame. She would bewail
my death without other interest then that of conserving my memory; and fear
having no place in her heart, the grief alone of having lost me would wholly
possess her Soul. If I dyed, added he, in defending Isabella; if the loss of my
life could restore her to her liberty, I should be happy, and I should think my
fortune worthy of envy. But I dye to leave her in the power of her enemy; I dye
without serving her, and without d^livering her; nay I dye without bidding her
farewell.

Hereat Ibrahim redoubled his grief, and his mind seeking for new occasions to
torment him, he was taken with a remorse of Conscience for having so long a
time worn a Turkish habit. He was persuaded that the misery whereinto he was
fallen was a punishment for this dissembling. He thought he had been ill
counseled, and though his intention had been pure, and that he had not done it
but out of a design to serve Christendom, to whom it had been very profitable,
and that his faith had never been shaken, yet he believed notwithstanding that
he was faulty. This reflection made him lift up his spirit to Heaven; crave
pardon for his levity; repent him of his misdeeds; and then pray that
Isabella's innocence might not be involved in the chastisement of his crime.

The last thing that yet afflicted Ibrahim was, that in his misfortune he could
not find any that would tell the Sultan that which he had resolved to request
of him in the favor of Isabella, for Rustan had taken order to the contrary. He
had also by the power of Roxelana kept every body from going out of the
Serraglio, after Ibrahim was entered into it; so that although it was known in
Constantinople, that there was some great disorder between Soliman and Ibrahim,
yet the people did not suspect, that the Sultan could hate him with so much
violence; for if they had been of that opinion, loving Ibrahim as they did,
they would without doubt have set fire on the Serraglio, rather then not have
succored him.

In the mean time Rustan being returned to Soliman, whose mind was full of
nothing but deadly thoughts, this Prince, to satisfy that fantastic scruple,
which obliged him not to believe the death of Ibrahim to be unjust, but because
he had promised him, that he should not dye as long as he lived, commanded him
to keep at his beds head, and to be sure not to go to put Ibrahim to death,
till he was fast asleep. After this order given, Soliman laid him down with an
intention (if one may be permitted to speak so) as it were to summon sleep with
silence and quietness. He did what he could to divert his mind from all kind of
objects; to the end that ceasing to think, he might the more easily let himself
be vanquished by this invisible Enemy, who always surmounts those more easily
which resist him, then those which seek him.

The Sultan, being thus recollected within himself, remained a while with so
much tranquillity in appearance, as Rustan believed that he was asleep, and
that he might go and put Ibrahim to death; But he had scarcely made one step,
when as this Prince rising up in his bed, Stay, said he unto him, I am not
asleep; and I will not have thee part from hence, till thou art certain I am
so. Rustan, not daring to contradict the Grand Signior, and fearing to make him
more awake then he was, if he talked longer to him, only promised him not to
offer any more to go out of his chamber, till he was well assured that he could
hear nothing. After this Soliman did yet all that he could to sleep; howbeit he
had no sooner closed his eyes, but his unquietness augmented; he was vexed that
he could not be master of his thoughts, and that that which he did to provoke
sleep, was that which awakened him the more. He turned him on one side, and
then on the other, and yet was not able to find any rest. One might have said
that he met with thorns every where; that the change of place redoubled his
unquietness; and when of purpose he forbore from speaking, and complaining
aloud, his sighs gave Rustan but too many signs that he was not asleep.
Soliman's impatience growing stronger, he thought if he walked a while, that it
may be he should become drowzy with weariness: He got out of his bed then, and
walking sometimes with violence, and sometimes with less precipitation, it
might have been said, that he was the cause of as much unquietness to Rustan,
as he felt himself, to see that he gave him not the means to execute the
desires of the cruel Roxelana. He stood still many times, and then began again
to walk faster then he had done. Afterward he leaned down in one place, and
then in another, scarcely knowing what he did, nor what he would do. When as he
had walked a long time, and that through weariness he had laid himself down
again upon his bed, he found yet less disposition to sleep then before; for his
agitation having dissipated some vapors, which peradventure might have lulled
his Reason, and charmed his displeasure, he no sooner had a mind to close his
eyes, but his imagination represented things yet more lively unto him; And
whereas a long time before he had had none but violent passions, such then too
were all his thoughts. How unhappy am I, said he to himself! I find an
impossibility in all that I desire; the least things are forbidden me; even
sleep, which all my Subjects enjoy, is to me a prohibited good; that which I do
to get it, is that which deprives me of it; and though I change place, yet
still is it all one with me; surely I must be separated from my self, if I will
find the rest which I seek for. In fine, I am more an enemy to my self, then
Ibrahim is, yea and I am more unhappy then he.

After his unquietness had made him change place an hundred times, Rustan,
seeing day approach, would have persuaded him not to amuse himself about this
scruple, and to permit him to go and strangle Ibrahim with his own hands, to
punish him, said he, for the unquietness which he gives thy Highness: But
Soliman spoke unto him with so much fury, as he was constrained to hold his
peace. This cruel motion of Rustan's, struck this Prince with horror, and
whereas it is a way to compassion, leaning on a table, which was near to his
bed, his imagination insensibly presented him with other objects. He saw
Isabella all in tears for the death of Ibrahim; yea it represented to him the
deplorable estate wherein he was; he remembered the time when he was his Slave;
and that glorious day, wherein laden with chains he had saved him his Empire
and his life: And comparing it with that wherein he was then, he could not
choose but be moved at it. After this, the sight of Rustan brought to his memory
all the miseries of his house, and all the violences which he had done by his,
and Roxelana's counsel. The death of Mustapha, that of Sarraida, of her son, of
Gianger, the forcible carrying away of Axiamira, her imprisonment, the War of
Persia, the things which Ibrahim had performed therein, the death of Zelebis,
and many other such like things, which filled his mind with so many deadly
ideas, as the love which he bore to Isabella began to be too weak to dissipate
them. He felt some repugnancy in his heart for that which he did; and his
Reason being suddenly untangled, What do I, said he to himself, senseless that I
am, not to consider, that the impossibility which I find to destroy a disarmed
man, whom I hold in my hands, who is laden with irons, and who is without
defense in the midst of his Executioners, is without doubt a sign that Heaven
protects him. For if it were not so, I had destroyed him ere this; I had not
promised him so long ago that I would not put him to death; I had not remembered
it so precisely; this Artifice, which they have found out for me to be
revenged, had succeed^d; I had slept, and Ibrahim had been dead. But I see
plainly, as I have said, that Heaven guards him, and that it will not let me be
revenged. But alas! said he still to himself, for what crime, for what injury,
for what outrage will I be revenged? No, no, continued he, Ibrahim is not
guilty, and I alone am the offender; for I owe all things to him, and he owes
nothing to me. It is true, that he would have gone out of my Empire without my
leave, but it was to save his Mistress; and this generous man, who might have
overthrown all my State, to secure himself, and to be revenged of the
infidelity which I have used to him, was contented to fly away like a simple
Slave. Let us harken to Reason which speaks to us; let us harken to the voice
of the Prophet who holds our hand; and let us harken no longer to this unjust
love that possesses us.

Here Soliman could not retain his tears, and the love which he bore to
Isabella made him, that he still found some difficulty in resolving to be
deprived of her: But Rustan's endevoring once more to carry him to violence
made him incline wholly to Virtues side. No, no, said he unto him, base as thou
art, I will commit no more crimes by thy counsel; the Prophet, who guards me,
will keep me from dipping my hands in the blood of Ibrahim; and if I am to shed
any, it must be theirs, who blemish my glory with their pernicious counsels.
Rustan, hearing Soliman speak in this manner, thought that he had lost his
Reason; for whereas nothing new had happened, he could not comprehend, how in
so short a time so great a change should arrive unto him. But he knew not, that
they, which have virtuous inclinations, and which are not wicked but by a
violent passion, or the counsel of others, have need but of a moment to carry
them to that which is good. Their Reason is no sooner cleared, but they find a
mighty succor in themselves; and so soon as they have a will to fight, the
victory is certainly theirs. Soliman gave an illustrious example of this verity
in this occasion; it being most sure, that never was there a greater or more
sudden change made, then that which was made in his Soul. He charged Rustan not
to go out of his chamber, and commanded another to go and fetch Ibrahim and
Isabella to him, who little thought what Virtue was doing for their advantage.
This Prince nevertheless had great unquietness still; he seemed uncertain in
his resolutions; and during the agitations of his Soul, he cried out sometimes,
O Heaven! must Ibrahim be destroyed? then suddenly checking himself; but also,
said he, can I resolve to lose Isabella? After this, he sat him down on four
Cushions, and hiding his face with both his hands, leaning on a table, as it
were the better to think of that which he would resolve of, Rustan remained in
strange pain.

In the mean time Ibrahim could not comprehend, for what reason they made him
attend so long for his death. He feared lest some violence should be done to
Isabella; he doubted lest they should be so cruel as to put her to death before
his eyes; and in this pain, death no doubt would have been a remedy unto him,
had not the thought of never seeing Isabella again rendered it more grievous to
him, for that consideration, then for the loss of his life. The disorders of
his Soul for all that appeared not in his face; and one would hardly have
believed in looking on him, that he did think he should dye every minute.
Isabella, on her part, was not without trouble; for having understood, that
they came to fetch Ibrahim, she certainly believed that he was lost, and was
already preparing to follow him, when as they, who had order to go for her,
entered all into her chamber. As soon as she saw them, and that they had told
her how they had order to carry her before Soliman; if it be to put me to death
in his presence, answered she, I will give him thanks: But acquaint me at
leastwise, whether Ibrahim be living, and whether we shall dye together or no.
These men, not knowing Soliman's intentions, durst scarce answer her; only they
assured her that she should see the grand Vizier very suddenly, as indeed they
led her into the Hall where he was, attending the time of his execution. There
were seen about him his Guards weeping, and four Mutes that were to strangle
him, and that having in their hands Bow strings of black silk for that purpose,
seemed also to have some compassion of him.

This doleful object having touched the heart of Isabella, she could not
forbear giving a great skriek: Alas, said she, how do I repent me of my wish!
and how much more supportable had it been for me to dye alone, then to dye with
you? Ibrahim seeing and hearing her speak thus; What, Madam, said he unto her,
will they attempt upon your life? Ah! no, no, continued he, turning him to
those that environed him, it is a thing I shall never endur^: when they shall
meddle with none but me, I will tender my neck to them without resistance; but
if they attempt any thing on this Princess, I protest that I will strangle him
with mine own hands that shall offer any outrage to her. This is not that which
I will have, answered she; defend not my life, if they attempt upon yours,
since they are to be inseparable. I have not wished to live, but only that I
may not see you dye. As they would have continued speaking, they that came for
them told them, that they had nothing else in charge but to carry them before
the Grand Signior. Let us go then, said the Princess to him, let us go my dear
Justiniano; I repent me of my weakness, and since I must dye, provided that I
dye in your presence, I shall be glad that we may dye together: Let us go then
and beg for death of Soliman as a grace. Ah! Madam, cried the illustrious
Bassa, speak not of your death, if you will not have me dye in despair. Let us
go, Madam, let us go rather to beg your liberty of Soliman, and obtain of him
that the loss of my life may be the price of it. I will not have it without
you, answered she, wherefore persist not in wishing to save me.

In the mean time they arrived at Soliman's Chamber, whom they found still
leaning on a Table, and in a posture, that they could not see his face. As soon
as they were there, Ibrahim and Isabella cast themselves at his feet: My Lord,
said the Princess, if I may obtain the grace of thee, that I may dye with
Justiniano, I will not complain of thy Highness; but contrarily I will praise
thy justice. I am guilty, my Lord, and of an horrible crime against thee I have
made thee despise the friendship which thou barest to Justiniano; I have made
thee abandon Reason; I have put a stain on thy life; I have blemished thy
glory; I have troubled thy rest; and I have constrained the greatest Prince of
the Earth to oppose all his inclinations, which carry him to virtue, for to
follow an unjust passion. Thou plainly see, my Lord, that wrath ought to have
a more just foundation in thy soul, then this Love, which afflicts thee, and
persecutes me. Change thy passion in my favor, but in such sort, that as I have
been the object of thy love, so I may be likewise of thy hate. Think of
revenging thy self on the true cause of thy unquietness; think of destroying,
and not of gaining me; the last is impossible, and the other is very easy for
thee. It is not because, if my tears could move thee, I can yet assure thee
that hate should have a place in my soul: For know, my Lord, that even
Justiniano, from whom thou will take away, both his honor, his life, and my
person, which is as dear to him as both the other, yet cannot hate thee. I have
seen it in his eyes, I have known it by his discourse; he complains of fortune;
he accuses that which thy Highness calls beauty in me; he names that weakness,
which another would name injustice; in fine, my Lord, being ready to dye
innocently by thy directions and command, yet am I well assured, that he will
dye without hatred; and that even in dying, he will make vows to obtain of
Heaven an advantageous change for thee. Judge after this, whether thou ought
to refuse me the grace that I may dye, and that he may be saved, since I am
guilty and he is innocent.

My Lord, said Justiniano interrupting her, harken not to the virtuous
Isabella, but to admire the greatness of her courage, and suffer not thy self
to be persuaded to that which she desires of thee. I will not stand to examine
whether I am culpable, or whether I am not, since to be hated of thee, is to be
so; but, my Lord, I will only tell thee, that if the sentence of my death
shall be pronounced by thy mouth, I will not murmur at it. I confess my
weakness to thee, my Lord; I cannot yet believe, but that all that which I have
seen since my return, is an enchantment, and not a truth. For how can it be
imagined, that great Soliman, who has loved me so tenderly, and given me so
glorious marks thereof, can be carried at this present to such unjust designs?
That with the same hand, wherewith he broke my chains, and put the reyns of his
Empire into mine, he can put about my neck the string which is to strangle me.
Does thy Highness no longer remember the thoughts which thou had, at such
time as, seeing me ready to enter into the grave, rather then displease thee
with craving my liberty of thee, thou resolvedst to have the incomparable
Isabella be brought away by force. Was it then, my Lord, out of a design to
ravish her from me, to persecute her, to blemish thy glory, and to take away my
life, in having unjust thoughts for her? Think not, my Lord, of the services I
have done thee, but of those which I purposed to do thee; yet think not of
them, my Lord, for to pardon me, but think of them to save Isabella. Restore
her to her liberty, make not me the cause of her undoing, send her back into
her Country, and after that put me to death here. But grant me at leastwise the
grace to pronounce my sentence unto me; for I confess to thee once more, that I
doubt whether it be possible, that thou should be the same Soliman which has
so dearly loved me.

It is in vain for you to desire, said Isabella, that we should be separated;
that thought is unjust, and does wrong to our affection; it is a motion whereof
I repent me, and whereof you ought to repent you. Beg then of Soliman, that we
may dye, or that we may live together; for provided he will grant us this, I
will attend his sentence, without grief, and without unquietness. You shall
live, said Soliman then to her, discovering his face, which he had all bathed
with tears; you shall live, generous Princess, Ibrahim's virtue has surmounted
me. Approach, said he unto him, and if it be so that thou do not hate me
still, beli^ve for a certain, that the good will which I have born thee is
recovering its place in my Soul: Repentance, which was a motion unknown to me,
chases the love of Isabella from it, therein to re-establish my friendship to
Ibrahim; I feel it coming, my Reason re-assumes its use; I see my injustice and
my violence with confusion; I see the virtue of Isabella, and no longer see her
beauty; she strikes me with admiration, and no longer strikes me with love; I
wish I could imitate her generosity, and no longer desire the possession of
her. In fine, said he to Ibrahim, know, that of all the marks of affection,
that which thou receivest from me at this present, is without doubt the
greatest: and to give no bounds to it, and to make thee see, that knowing my
fault, I will punish it, and to keep my self from falling into it a second
time, I do not only give thee thy life, which I would have unjustly taken from
thee, but I do also give thee thy liberty, as well as that of the incomparable
Isabella.

Oh! my Lord, cried Ibrahim, I hear the voice of Soliman; they which spoke to
me from him have betrayed his true thoughts. No, continued Ibrahim, let us
speak no more of this doleful adventure, but as of a fable; and without
th^nking of that which is past, suffer me only to give thee thanks for thy
clemency. As for me, added Isabella, who eternally remembers benefits, and very
easily forgets injuries; if it be so, that great Soliman has vanquished
himself, I promise thy Highness to make vows as long as I live for thy glory.

Doubt not of that which I say, replied Soliman, and the better to assure you
thereof, I permit you, said he unto her with a voice interrupted with sighs, to
go out of my Empire when you please: I should also be generous enough to share
it with Ibrahim, to whom it appertains more justly then to me, if I could
infuse into the hearts of my subjects the thoughts which are in mine.

During this discourse Rustan was in a strange unquietness; and when as he
believed that Soliman had his mind busied, and did not think of him, he would
have slipped out of the Chamber, to go and advertise Roxelana of that which was
doing: But Soliman perceiving it, Stay, said he unto him, infamous wretch; and
then he commanded him to be turned out of the Serraglio, without permitting him
to speak to any body; and charged him with a great deal of fury never to show
himself more before him. After this, he sent for the virtuous Achmat, and the
Sultana Asteria. It is by these two persons, said he to Ibrahim, that I will be
counseled, to know what way we may take, that Justiniano may cease to be
Ibrahim, without making a noise amongst the people, which might prejudice my
State: For as for my self, continued he sighing, it is so little a while since
my Reason has recovered its place, as I dare not yet rely upon it. Ibrahim,
whom we will call most commonly hereafter Justiniano, answered the Grand
Signior with as much generosity as joy; for whereas he had exceedingly loved
this Prince, how great soever that was which he felt, to see Isabella escaped
from so great a danger, yet was he not a little gl^d also to see in Soliman the
marks of his ancient virtue again.

In the mean time, after that the Sultan had acquainted the sage Achmat, and
the generous Asteria with the business in question, in such terms, as well
declared the repentance of his soul; and after they had commended the
resolution he was in, and mightily confirmed him in the design which he had to
restore Justiniano and Isabella to their liberty; Achmat, who never knew of
Justiniano's disguising till then, counseled, since the matter was so far
advanced, that the people should be made to believe, how the Grand Signior had
put Ibrahim to death, upon some discovery that he had held intelligence with
the Emperor Charles, and favored the Christians in all things; yea and that some
letters too should be forged, which should be said he had been made to confess,
by which means the matter would easily be credited, because it was true that
every one knew, how the illustrious Bassa had always protected the Christians.
He said moreover, that if the business was not carried in that sort, it would
be impossible to find out a plausible pretext to keep the people from
suspecting some trick in the absence of Ibrahim, which might produce dangerous
consequences.

Th^s advice being approved of, yet because Justiniano and Isabella could not
be sent away toward Genoua presently, it was thought requisite to have them
secretly conveyed to Pera, and there to remain concealed with those Greek
Priests, whom Justiniano had so much favored, until such time as a vessel could
be made ready for them. This farewell could not be taken without shedding of a
world of tears; Soliman craved pardon of Justiniano and Isabella, who after
they had an^wered him with tenderness and submission, and assured him that they
would forget what was past, desired him he would be pleased to give their
friends their liberty, which the Sultan having granted them, they were sent for
and conducted along with them to Pera. The Sultana Asteria and Isabella said to
one another all that a most strict friendship could make two generous persons
say in such like encounters. And the prudent Achmat, charging himself with the
conduct of Justiniano and his Mistress, conveyed them with all their Troop
aboard a Barque, which carried them to Pera. Soliman could not for all that see
Isabella part, without following her with his eyes, nor could he see Ibrahim go
away without forgetting Isabella; it being most certain, that never was there a
truer repentance, then that of this great Prince.

In the mean time to make it be believed that Ibrahim was dead, a black
Standart was set up before the gate of his Palace: Achmat, fearing a sedition,
put all the Janissaries into arms, and gave them to understand, that Ibrahim was
a Traitor, that he had gone about to overthrow the Empire, and that his death
had been absolutely necessary for the preservation of the State. He showed them
also certain forged Letters, to give the more credit to that which he said; But
whatsoever he could say, no sooner was the black Standart seen before the gate
of his Palace, but all the people began to murmur; There was nothing but
weeping and crying all over Constantinople.

Those Janissaries that had been the best persuaded, left not for all that to be
exceedingly afflicted; for he was so universally beloved, as there was not any
body which did not lament and commend him. Some said, that Roxelana without
doubt was the cause of this mischief; and that she still remembered, how he had
been the Protector of Prince Mustapha. Some cried out to have at leastwise the
body of their Defender given unto them; others, that his Executioners might be
delivered into their hands; and all of them together agreed in the belief, that
Soliman had lost the force of his Empire, and the support of his State.

During this tumult, Rustan passing through a street, the people, who had
understood by some that had been in the Serraglio, how it was he which had been
made use of for this deadly Ceremony, and that he had put Ibrahim to death,
fell upon him with so many imprecations, and with such fury, as they tore him
in a thousand pieces. From thence they went to his P^lace, to set it on fire;
but at length the prudent Achmat, having appeased this sedition, returned to
the Serraglio, where he found that Heaven had made an end of revenging
Justiniano on his enemies. For Roxelana having understood that he was not dead,
and that Rustan had been torn in pieces by the people, this fierce and proud
spirit, was so sensibly touched with spite for that she could not exercise all
her whole fury, that after she had continued three hours together without
speaking a word, she dyed for very rage and madness; and Justiniano had the
satisfaction to know, that he was lamented of all the world, and that the only
persons which could rejoice at his death had been punished for their injustices.

In the mean time Achmat by Soliman's Command caused the same Christian Vessel
to be made ready, which Justiniano had formerly used to get from
Constantinople; and in one night he sent aboard her all the riches of Ibrahim's
Palace, and a great deal more, which he was constrained to accept of against
his inclination. The Sultan wrote also with his own hand to the illustrious
Bassa, and again assured him of his repentance and affection, whereunto
Justiniano and Isabella answered with a great deal of generosity. The death of
Roxelana touched Soliman less, then it would have done at any other time. For
as he could not but remember that she had been the object of his affection; so
could he not, but much more remember, that she had been the cause of all his
misfortunes, and of all his crimes, and that she would have carried him to put
to death the only man of the world whom most he loved.

This feigned death of Ibrahim was carried with so much address by the prudent
Achmat, that every body believed it to be so; and that is it which has made
Paulus Jovius, and all those which have spoken of the reign of Soliman, to say,
that the grand Vizier perished in that sort; but indeed the matter past as I
have delivered it: For a Greek Caloyer, who had this History from Justiniano's
and Isabella's own mouth, left a relation thereof, which is come even unto us.

In the mean time, three days after the feigned death of Ibrahim, the true
Justiniano, Isabella, Sophronia, Hipolita, Emilia, Leonida, Horatio, Alphonso,
Doria, the French Marquess, and a number of Christian Slaves, whose liberty
Justiniano had obtained, imbarqued themselves one night, and set sail for
Genoua, without fear of other enemies, then the winds and the Seas; but Fortune
had made too much trial of their virtue, for to inflict new disasters on them;
and indeed she was so favorable unto them, that never was there a more
prosperous Navigation heard of.

During this Voyage, th^se illustrious persons had no other entertainment, then
to talk of the dangers which they had avoided. And whereas Justiniano and
Isabella had promised that they would be inseparable in their felicity, as they
had been in their unhappiness; that Horatio and Hipolita had done the like;
that Sophronia and Doria had sworn never to quit one another; and that Alphonso
and Leonida following the others example had taken the same resolution; it fell
out that only the French Marquess and Emilia remained without matching
together, yea and that would never match with any. For one day as this fair
company were talking together in the Captains Cabin, Leonida having demanded
of the French Marquess laughing, what end he propounded to ^^mself in the
affection, which he bore to Emilia? No other, answered ^e, but that of lo^ing
her as long as my inclination shall carry me thereunto. I am of the some mind,
replied Emilia, and I could never without aversion behold a man, who of my
(...) become my Master, or at leastwise mine Equal. O, cried the Marquess, how
(...) for this humor! for to speak freely, and acquaint you with a secret,
which I have never told to a^y body; know, that the true cause of my
inconstancy has been the fear of marriage: I have always been so afraid of
engaging my self therein, as to avoid the occasions of it, I have use^ to
change Mistress often. But if I can obtain of Emilia, that she will not oblige
me to be her ^usband, I will be eternally her Slave. All the company then burst
out a laughing, and belee^ing that their discourse was nothing but sport, every
one fe^l to pressing of Emilia, that s^e would make him become constant, in not
marrying him. Whereupon the Marquess and she made a Satyr against marriage,
wherein on either part they said very pleasant things. and for a conclusion,
that which was believed to be but jesting, proved to be their true thoug^ts;
and they took as much care to promise one another that they would never marry,
as ^e others took to obtain of their Mistresses, that as soon as they should
come to Genoua, the^ would render their fortunes inseparable, as indeed they
did. The wind having been ext^eamly favorable to them, they arrived in a few
days at Monaco; where the Princess was rece^ved of her Subjects with as much
astonishment as joy. The brute of their return being presen^ly got to Genoua,
the chief of the Senate came thither to visit them.

These illustrious persons concealed ^o much of their adventures, as they
thought was not fit to be spoken of; and having been entreated by their
friends, that they would after so many mis^ortunes celebrate the ceremony ^f
their nuptials at Genoua; Isabella yielded thereunto with blushing: for which
effect they parted away the next day, and shortly after the Marriages of
Justiniano and Isabella, of Horatio and Hipolita, of Doria and Sophronia, and
of Alphonso and Leonida, were solemnized with all possible magnificences. The
French Marquess and Emilia promised anew an inviolable friendship to one
another, with an oath that neither of them would ever marry: and during certain
days there were nothing but Balls, running at the Ring, and public Feasts.
After which Justiniano and Isabella being re-entred into the possession of all
that belonged unto them, they were conducted with a great deal of state to
Monaco; where they lived with as much satisfaction, they had had mishaps;
Justiniano esteeming himself more happy in the possession of I^ lla, then if he
had reconquered the Empire of his Fathers. But by a revolution which ^monly
arrives in all things, it is come to pass, that the Principality of Monaco is
return (...) unto a branch of the House of the Grimaldies, which possesses it
at this day, under the protection of Spain; nothing remaining of Justiniano but
the memory of his glorious actions; which certainly are great and famous
enough, to oblige Posterity never to lose the remembrance of THE ILLUSTRIOUS
BASSA.
