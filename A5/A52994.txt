A NEW SONG, ON THE Strange and Wonderful GROANING BOARD.
I.
WHat Fate inspired thee with Groans,
To fill Phanatick Brains?
What is it thou sadly thus bemoans,
In thy Prophetic Strains?
II.
Art thou the Ghost of William Pryn,
Or some Old Politician?
Who long tormented for his Sin,
Laments his sad Condition?
III.
Or must we now believe in thee,
The Old Cheat Transmigration?
And that thou now art come to be
A Call to Reformation?
IV.
The giddy Vulgar to thee run,
Amazed with Fear and Wonder;
Some dare affirm, that hear thee groan,
Thy Noise is petty Thunder.
V.
One says and Swears, you do foretell
A Change in Church and State;
Another says, you like not well
Your Master Stephens Fate.
VI.
Some say, you Groan much like a Whigg,
Or rather like a Ranter;
Some say as loud, and full as big
As Conventicle Canter.
VII.
Some say, you do Petition,
And think you represent
The Woe, and sad Condition
Of Old Rump Parliament.
VIII.
The wisest say, you are a Cheat;
Another Politician
Says, it is a Mystery as great
And true, as Hatfield Vision.
IX.
Some say, it is a New Evidence,
Or Witness of the Plot;
And can Discover many things,
Which are the Lord knows what.
X.
And least you should the Plot Disgrace,
For wanting of a Name,
Narrative Board henceforth we'll place
In Registers of Fame.
London, Printed for T. P. in the Year 1682.
