O MOST mighty Lord God, who art our Castle, and our deliverer, our defender in
whom we trust: save we humbly beseech thee, the Cities now distressed by the
Rebels Forces; give them Courage and Fidelity, bless their Counsels, prosper
their Enterprises, and so supply all their wants, by thine infinite fulness,
that their Assailants may return back with loss and shame, and that they, and
we may therefore praise thy Name, through Jesus Christ our Lord, AMEN.
