THE HISTORY OF DIMAGORAS*

THE HISTORY Of the most Vile DIMAGORAS Who by Treachery and Poison blasted the
incomparable Beauty of Divine PARTHENIA: Inter-woven with the History of
AMORONZO AND CELANIA.

THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
READER,
GRow bigg with expectation, Dimagoras is revived, and lays his old claim to
the Throne of Love; Pride justifies both his Worth and Title; and Treachery
promotes it. In this ambitious rage he either poisons Love, or betrays it;
profanes it in his own affection, or stifles it in that of others: He scorns to
dye in Quarto's that intends to fill Volumes with his mischeifs.

These Leaves are but a Portal to his more capacious Fabric of confusion; A
piece which importunity rather ravished from me, then design intended.

Untimely Births do usually come forth swadled in their own imperfections; such
Issues of the brain, are more liable to defects then those of the body,
wherein, through haste and importunity I am fallen short of expectation; I hope
either thy Candor will remit, or thy more pregnant fancy will supply; Let me be
a Copy, though not a Pattern, and follow, where I cannot lead; but we usually
say, Money is not base unless the Allay exceed the pure; and there may be good
enough in these if there be so much good therein as to make them pass for
current, and though they obtain no praise, yet I hope they will incur no
obloquy: Where defects are not watched, a little virtue may go far: Thine
acceptance may raise my fancy as well as enlarge it, and will as much encourage
(as my promise and resolution binds) me to the prosecution of the History.

A Story but half completed cannot please beyond its proportioned measure; but
when you shall with a pleasing horror read, and seriously perpend the
mischeivous designs of Dimagoras, and with a sad delight ruminate upon the
obstacles of the sacred Loves of Amoronzo and Celania, then I question not but
thy conceit may be thereby doubled, and therein, my recompense.

Farewell.
TO My Honored Friend RICHARD CVLMNE OF CANALEE, In the County of DEVON, Esquire;
SIR,
IF these my small Endeavors may find acceptance, I have the end of my
desires; I confess they are the fruits of some spare hours, designed only for
the benefit of recreation; therefore I hope you will read them for diversions,
not Precepts; only let me advise you, to meditate upon the unworthiness of
Dimagoras with detestation; upon the puissance of Amoronzo with admiration;
upon the hospitality of Kalander with imitation; upon the Virtues of Celania
with affectation: Thus if you can gather any delight from it, I am very well
satisfied, desiring you to pardon what you find amiss, and no to dis-respect it
in being mine* So you shall engage me to be

SIR, Yours to esteem yo^ JO. QUARLES.

THE HISTORY OF Dimagoras, Interwoven with the History OF AMORONZO AND CELANIA.
BOOK I.
WHen Argalus no longer could abide
It Is grief, not news to say, Parthenia died;
Fates sad Decrees are not to be rever'st
both lived, both loved, both died, and that is the worst,
But that which non-plust most that troubled Age,
Was that Dimagoras outlived the rage
Or much incensed Argalus, whose fame
For noble Acts, advanced his honored name
Almost beyond extr'ordinary, and made
Conquest grow customary, yet it is said
That poor perplexed Argalus lay dead
Buried in grief, whilst vile Dimagoras fled
Unprosecuted, and for this respect
Some say Parthenia charged him with neglect;
But it is well known that Authors may incline
To errors, by mistake, and so does mine:
But this suspected matter is best tried
By real hearted Lovers that abide
The like misfortune, for Parthenia's breath
Blasted with grief was fading into death,
And should distressed Argalus then go
From his dear-dying Love, to seek a Foe
He knew not where, alas! he was at strife
Whether to lose Parthenia, or his life;
Suppose he had, to prosecute his rage,
Usurpt a sad and groaning pilgrimage,
And left his dear affections to the care
Of her own thoughts, then crowded with despair,
What then? at his return he might have found
His labor lost, Parthenia under ground*
But I Will desist, and recollect my thoughts,
That Love is only rare, that has no faults.
It Is not my tax to treat upon the dead,
But to pursue Dimagoras that is fled,
We know not where, yet close persuit and time
May bring reward to his unheard of Crime.
My blood-hound Muse shall ransack all about
Till we have found this worst of Villains out,
And then we will give what we can best afford,
A pen often times cuts deeper then a Sword.
Frightn'd with his own fears, Dimagoras flies
He knows not where, and in his flight he cries
He knows not why, and in his cries, he vents
A flood of tears, then deep-mouthed oaths prevent
A further desuge, then a curse succeeds
That host of oaths, and then he thinks his deeds
Are so Authentic, that he needs not fly,
Nor fear, nor swear, nor curse, nor grieve, nor dye;
But having claimed the respite of a pause,
He thus discourst, Dimagoras thy cause
Is just and good, disturb not then thy mind
It Is fit that men, when women prove unkind,
Should be as cruel, it is well known, thy fame
Thy worth, thy honor, might have laid a claim
To her deserts, what though her beauty swelled
Beyond a Venus, what though she excelled
Her Sex in wit, what though her ample parts
Did ravish, nay monopolize the Arts?
Art thou not rich, and great? is not thy Land
Unbounded, nay, and can not thou command
Armies to wait thy pleasure? and will thou
Basely degenerate, and fondly bow
Unto a woman's frowns, 'twas but a deed
Proportioned to her fault, and will thou bleed
These inward drops? come, contemn thy pain
And grief, thou can not act it over again.
Did not her tender hearted Mother grieve
To see thy sorrows, laboring to relieve
Thy sad extreamities, did not her care,
Her skill, her wit, endeavor to prepare
Parthenia's heart, and yet obdurate she
Learned to deny, by importunity:
Her mother often would say, ah who can find
The vast dimensions of a woman's mind,
There Is not a day, an hour, much less a minute,
That brings them not an alteration in it:
They Are like unfixed Stars, that always move,
They hate to day, what they to morrow love*
But if the influence of one single Star,
Can so disorder man to make him jarr
With his own reason, nay, bid sense adieu,
Oh! what will then a Constellation do:
Thus walking, talking, pausing altogether,
His heedless feet brought him he knew not whither
But gazing toward the West, he soon espied
The aged day was grown so heavy-ey'd,
That being almost destitute of Light,
If shrunk away, and bid the world goodnight;
Whilst silent Vesper modestly expressed
A speedy reason for approaching rest,
To which Dimagoras yielding, soon reposed
Upon his Mothers virdent lap, and closed
His slumbring eye lids, whilst the whispering wind
And the conspiring leaves, as it were combined
To grace his slumbers, but his panting breast
Being grown Stranger to accustomed rest,
Denotes an inward conflict; for each part
Seems to disclaim the motions of his heart,
And at the twy-light of his dawning eye
His ears were entertained with a cry
Half drowned in tears, and then a drilling tone
Would seem to be a trebble to each groan,
But at the last, these cries, these groans, increased
Into a voice distinct, and after ceased
Their wordless tones, and being well refined
Into a speech they cried Oh thou unkind
And most accursed Catiffe, do thou live
T'out-brave revenge, or cannot vengeance give
Reward to villainy, or have thou got
A counter-mand to contradict thy lot,
Or are the Gods forgetful, can they see
A vessel laden with impiety
And yet not sink it, or did they create thee
Without a Soul, and so forget to date thee?
Is there no time for punishment; Oh thou
That think thy self secure, and wilt allow
Of no contrition, know the time draws near
When horrid-ill-shap'd Vengeance shall appear
Ugly, beyond it self, and shall express
The lise of horror in a lively dress,
She Is now attiring, and her robes shall be
Flame-colour'd, trimmed with lavish tyranny,
Her hair dishelving from her flaming head
Shall be hot-burning wyre, which shall be spread
Over her spacious shoulders; in her face
Shall be black spots of envy and disgrace,
Her eyes like fatal Comets, shall out flame
Two Firmaments of Brimstone, and thy name
Shall by the dreadful thunder of her tongue
Startle, even Hell it self, and live among
T'infernal Furies, and for ever be
An adding plague unto their misery;
Thy woes shall swell into so large a score
That quick invention shall invent no more.
Even as the weather-glass, which being pressed
By a warm hand, its water cannot rest
But shrinks away, and hides it self, as 'twere
Within it self, yet will at last repair
(The hand removed) into its proper place,
Even such was sad Dimagoras his case,
His Spirits shrunk away being touched with fear,
His fear persu'd with guilt, made him appear
A senseless living statue, yet at length
Receiving some of his declining strength
He raised himself, and with a feeble tone
Began to speak; had not a sudden groan
Prevented th'inundation of his words
He had proceeded, but his grief affords
No speedy utt'rance, therefore he was forced
To walk, and leave the matter undiscours'd.
Thus walking to and fro his trembling breast
Strongly inclined him to a second rest,
But his persuasive fears would not allow
The least refreshment to his willing brow;
At last oppressed with a sudden gail
Of sighs, his wearied feet began to fail,
And in a melancholy valley, there
Reposed Dimagoras, but not his fear,
His fear instructs him that his eyes behold
Strange visions, and his trembling heart grows cold
For as the Sea which cannot be at peace
Upon a sudden, though the tempest cease
Even so Dimagoras, though the former blast
Of his fierce rage was moderately past,
Yet his innated violence was such,
That like the living plant, at every touch
He shrunk into despair, and here we find
The dangerous Issues of a troubled mind:
And thus the flames of his increasing fires
(Blown by the bellows of his own desires)
Consumes his reason, and his former deeds
Present themselves, he raging thus proceeds.
Oh ye immortal Powers, why have ye sent
So much of trouble, and so small content
Into my boiling breast, ah must my life
Become a woeful Laborinth of strife!
Why do I live? since every moment brings
A thousand Serpents, with ten thousand stings
To torture me, and whilst I study why
And what I live for, I despair to dye?
What greater curse than this did ere attend
Mortality, how often must I spend
My sighs, my groans upon the idle air,
And hear no other language but despair,
Despair, and dye Dimagoras, it is a death
Nay worse, to live, go quarrel with thy breath:
Did thou not hear thy most unequaled Fate
Thund'red, nay worse, into thy ears of late.
Yet do thou dare to live, resolve, and dye,
And make the Devil guilty of a Lie.
Do thou observe how yonder spreading tree
Would fain be proud to bear such fruit as thee,
Take courage in thy ruin, haste away,
He feeds a danger most that loves delay,
And he that lives for fear of being dead,
Spins out his grief unto the smallest thread.
What greater torment is then self-grief?
And what more Charity then self-relief?
Triffle no more, it is childish to complain,
And easier far to dye than live in pain.
Courage Dimagoras, come, march toward that place
Of speedy ease with a delightful grace;
Do thou relent, what has a sudden wind
Raised a new tempest in thy stormy mind?
Will thou recede, fie, fie, spur up thy will
To a more certainty, why stand'st thou still?
Let not the dull commands of flesh and blood
Deter thy heart from so approved a good.
Suppose thou sawst a wretch stretchd out at length
Upon the rack, and having spent his strength
In tedious groans, yet would refuse to be
(Though much entreated) set at liberty;
Would thou not style him mad, and say his grief
Was due desert that should deny relief
So freely proffered; Is not now thy case
The very same, thou know thou may displace
Thy Sorrows in a moment, yet thy heart
Combines with fear, and will not let them part;
Resolve, resolve, and let thy speedy breath
Express, it is better dye, than live in death.
Thus said, and thus resolved, he wastes no time,
But with extended arms, attempts to climb
The lofty tree, but ere he could aspire
Unto the height of his too rash desire,
His trembling arms disclaimed their idle hold
And down he fell, and being down, his cold
And much affrightned senses thought it fit
To leave him reason equal to his wit.
There lay new-dropt- Dimagoras, till a Knight
And his enamored Lady put to flight
By adverse fortune, chanced to pass that way
Where dead, (as they supposed) Dimagoras lay,
But Fate Decreed it otherwise; for now
His almost senseless thoughts were pausing how
He came so low, nor could he think or tell
How he climbed up the Tree, nor how he fell,
But turning on his back, his dazzled sight
Seemed to assure him that the armed Knight
Was daring Argalus, and when his eye
Observed the beauteous Lady standing by,
His trembling heart enforced his tongue to say
Oh Argalus, oh wronged Parthenia!
And there he stopped, as if his heart had swore
After Parthenia's name to speak no more,
But yet the pleasure of her name did seem
Like a reviving Cordial to redeem
His senses from captivity, and thus
Outragiously he cried, O Argalus!
Oh most divine Parthenia, here, here, lies
The perfect mirror of all villainies,
'Twas I, 'twas I, conducted by the flame
Of my own lust, and clothed with the shame
Of my own crimes, that did attempt to do
A deed, that none but Hell, advised me to:
'Twas I, 'twas wretched I, that did commence
A wicked suite against thine Innocence!
Ah poor Parthenia, how did I delude
Thy ravished mind, and barbarously intrude
Upon thy privacy, and made thee know
(Instead of bliss expected) perfect woe;
Thy heart conceived that the joyful sum
Of all thy hopes, thy Argalus was come,
But all in vain, for thy deceived Love
Met with a Serpent seeking for a Dove.
Could I restore -- And there his feeble voice
Changed, and recoy'ld into a dreadful noise:
With that the Knight being suddenly amazed
Stood silent for a time, and only gazed
Upon this dreadful object. but at length.
Being bold in courage, he employed his strength
To raise him from the earth, which having done
Bold in a new attempt, he thus begun.
What art thou, say what art thou, that do thus
Unman thy self to be afraid of us
That would be courteous, and redress thy grief
Would thou be capable of our relief;
Let thy dull reason credit what we say,
I am not Argalus, nor I Parthenia
Replied the Lady: At which words he raised
His frenzy head, and for a while he gazed,
And then his lavish tongue began to cry
Oh Argalus, oh blessed Parthenia, why
Why do ye thus torment a Ghost that strayes
It knows not where, these unaccustomed ways
Prove dreadful to me, but me thinks I spy
By those pale looks ye'are Ghosts as well as I:
Oh do but hand me to the Elizian plains
Where ye recide, and lead me from these pains,
These racks, these tortures, oh what torments wait
Upon the ruins of a cursed state,
But stay, me thinks I see -- And there his eyes
Decayed, and seemingly Dimagoras dies:
The courteous Knight perceiving by discourse
It was the strength of passion did divorce
His senses from their faculties, grew sad
To think no means, no medicine could be had
To bring him from his trance, till at the last
His charitable Lady that had past
Much time in trouble, having heard the vain
And strange effusions of his idle brain,
Takes forth a glass, within whose brittle wall
There was enclosed a Spirit could recall
Revolted sense, then with a stretched out hand
She calls her Page, and gives him strict command
To take the glass, and presently convey
Some drops into his mouth, and have away:
The trembling Page with an affrighted look
(Obedient to his Ladies pleasure) took
The proffered glass, and with a fearful speed
Approached Dimagoras and performed the deed,
Which being done, Dimagoras composed
Of nothing less then reason, soon disclosed
His buried eyes, and gazing round about
(Pufft up with rage) his fury thus broke out,
Ye dreadful Tyrants is there all extent,
No diminution of my punishment;
Must I Epitomize your Plagues, did I
To humor you, thus play the fool, and dye
Before my time, I thought in pleasing you
To consummate those plagues which now renew:
I Am licensed by my torments, and I Will chide
Your damned injustice, were not you my guide
That led me hither, did not you advise me
To kill my self, and will ye thus despise me?
Must plagues be my reward, must I be plough'd
And harrow'd with my torments, not allowed
A minutes ease, are these, are the gains
That I was largely promised from my pains?
Oh Hell, and there his well-oath'd tongue let fall
A liberal shower, then he begun to call
Upon Parthenia, oh Parthenia, thou
That I abused on earth, how do thou now
Plague my abuses, oh that I could boast
Of so much comfort, as to see thy Ghost
And ask forgiveness, how content I Would lie
In the dull shades of blind obscurity,
I know, I know, thy patience would engage
Thy Argalus to mittigate his rage:
Alas, my sufferings much out run the power
Of my distracted patience, every hour
Brings every Plague, oh how I am oppressed,
Parthenia's pardon gives Dimagoras rest,
But ah in vain, with that his gazing eye
Staring about did suddenly espy
His former objects which rejoiced him more
Then all his tortures tortured him before:
It was that amorous Pair which only stayed
T'expect the Issue, whilst Dimagoras made
(After obeisance) more then usual speed,
And on his bended knees did thus proceed,
Oh ye immortal Ghosts that do inherit
Th'Elizian plains with a contented spirit,
Deign to behold, and do not frown to see
Your Prostitute upon his bended knee
Craving your pardon, which if I obtain
'Twill prove Physician to a world of pain,
Deny me not, but ah Parthenia move
In my behalf, thy dear, thy dearest Love,
Thy constant Argalus, let him not rest
Till he has granted my enforced request:
At which the Knight, turning his head aside,
To break a long-keept smile; Dimagoras cried
Oh Argalus do not remove those sweet,
Those pleasing looks, but let my sorrows meet
With thy calcining pity, pity take
Though not for mine, yet for Parthenia's sake.
Whereat the Knight (whose ears could not abide
The fierce Artillery of his tongue) replied,
Vain Self-deluder why do thou divest
Thy troubled Spirits of their liberal rest?
Thy actions have informed me, and I can
Declare, thou art no Ghost, nay scarce a man
Forget thy folly, strive to banish hence
Thy idle fancies, and recall thy sense
Into its proper Sphere, and cease to be
Deluded into cruel vanity;
Come hither, take my hand, and you shall find
That I am tangible, and that my mind
Is troubled for thee, view me well, and see
If thou can call to mind my Phisnomie,
Observe this tender Lady, and you will know
Whether she be Parthenia or no;
Nay start not back, approach, such Ghosts will do
No harm at all, especially to you:
At which Dimagoras with a fixed eye
Star'd in her lovely face, and seemed t'espye
Something he knew, but yet his troubled sense
(Much discomposed) could not say from whence
Those Fancies should arise, but yet at length
Having arrived to a little strength
Of long absented reason, he confessed
His shameful folly, whilst he thus expressed:
I am unghosted, and I now behold
What my amazed senses lately told
My heart ye are, and if I do mistake
Pardon I crave for Amoronzo's sake
Rare beauty: and if my request hall seem
Absurd, oh Amoronzo stand between
Your dear Celania's anger, and my breast;
For if she frown Dimagoras lives unblest:
With that, much-pleased Amoronzo took
Dimagoras by the hand, and with a look
As steadfast as his heart, he thus begun;
Unfortunate Dimagoras thou have run
A most preposterous course, for at this time
Thy Land is in an uproar, and the crime
Falls upon thee, the blood that has bin spilt
Cries out aloud, and testifies thy guilt;
Return, return, and let thy warlike hands
Mow down the courage of the Arcadian bands,
Thy absence gives advantage, every hour
Thou stay'st, thou give addition to their power,
Nay wonder not, nor do not stand to grieve
Or shake thy head, but practice to believe
Believe thy friend: And if thy low-ebb'd Fate
Wants those materials that become thy state,
Thou have a friend, a friend, that will impart
The secrt Counsels of a faithful heart,
And if my weak instructions will allow
Advantage to thy will, I Will teach thee how
Thou shall redeem thine honor, let us repair
To more convenience, and ^'le declare:
To which Dimagoras (being now supplied
With an indifferent reason) thus replied;
True Friend, your words distilling from a breast
So full of truth instructs me not to jest
With my own fortune, I confess, the late
And sad disturbance of my inward state
Has made me much incapable to be
A Favorite to my self; but since I see
Your liberal goodness which does truly tend
To my advice, I Will own you as my friend;
And if my future fortunes chance to fall
In balance with my wish, I only shall
Gaze at a distance, with a pleasing view,
And look upon those fortunes through you;
But since extreamities does now require
Action, not words, I Will cease, and we will retire;
But stay, I know not where, for since that day
I lost my self, I never found my way,
But hark, what noise is this that seems t'affright
My new-come sense, come, let us provide for flight;
Flight, oh most horrid, oh most dismal word
That cuts and wounds much deeper then a Sword,
(Replied the Knight) and if I meet with Foes
That dare encounter, I shall dare oppose
Could they command the Cyclop* to impail
And guard them round, I Would dye, or else prevail;
Look here Dimagoras (taking by the hand
His dear Celania, can thou understand
These speaking looks, whose very thoughts advance
The dullest Soul above the reach of chance;
But let us retire, for hark, the noise I hear
Increases more, because it draws more near;
Let Us have to yonder valley, where a while
I Will leave my dear Celania to beguile
The time with Prayers, and if you please, my Lord
Dimagoras, but to favor and afford
Your cheerful company to my divine
And dear Celania, you will much incline
My heart to thank you; and for thee my sweet
And most indulgent Love, could I but meet
With thy consent, how quickly would I fly
Upon my Foes, and bring thee victory,
But ah those silent Streams that trickle down
Thy too too liquid Cheeks do almost drown
My hopes in deep despair, thy tears (my Dear)
Are worse then poysned darts, and do appear
Like Seas (but more outrageous) for the flood
Of thy moist eye is not to be withstood,
And if the sullen world would learn t'invent
A way to kill me, let it but content
To woe thee to a tear, a frown, a cry,
And let me see it, and then, I conquered dye,
Then clear those clouded Skies, and let me see
The Sunshine of a smile, and I will be
More joyful then those Persians which adore
The rising Sun, grant this, I Will ask no more,
Nor can thou grant a greater boon then this,
For ah thy smiles, my Joy, are all my bliss,
Ah do not speak in tears, nor let a glut
Of sighs make sorrow cheap, each sigh does cut
My very intralls, and my wounded heart
Transfixt with briny tears begins to smart;
It Is in thy power t'extenuate my cares,
Cure me with smiles, or kill me with thy tears.
Have ye not seen with what a watery eye
After a shower the Sun begins to prye
Upon the earth, as if his bashful ray
Were grown ashamed to look upon the day,
Even so Celania gazed on the face
Of Amoronzo with a bashful grace,
Before the luster of whose eye there stood
(Ready to be dissolved into a flood)
Some Crystal bubbles which Eclip'st her light,
And sometimes dropped, yet would not rain downright
But at the last* poor Lover, she confines
Her tears, and for a time she spoke by signs,
But when she saw that Amoronzo went
To arm himself, sad Lady, then she sent
Both words, and sighs, and tears, whilst in her arms
She held him fast, and thus begun her charms.
Dear Amoronzo why do thou deceive me,
Pretend to love, and yet intend to leave me,
Oh speak my joy, tell me my high-priz'd Treasure
What have I done to merit thy displeasure?
Alas thy poor Celania never knew
Disloyal flames, and when she proves untrue
To Amoronzo, may she ever be
A Prostitute to lustful villainy;
But ah (my Dearest) say what mean those Arms
Those Symptoms of departure, what Alarms
Has lately frightened thee to these extremes,
It Is too, too true, oh that they were but dreams:
Thou shall not go, oh pity my sad heart,
I Would rather dye, then let my life depart.
The trembling wretch that is thrown into the deep
Unsensible of what he does, will keep
Fast hold of what he takes, as loath to dye,
Ah so does he my Love, and thus do I:
Could thou but spell my sighs and read my tears,
Thou soon would apprehend how many fears
Flow in upon me, for alas I know
Nothing but grief (my Dear) thou shall not go.
Oh that my tears were manacles to bind thee
Unto my Soul, then were I sure to find thee,
Dear do not leave me, but let pity move
Thy hand to kill, or else thy heart to Love,
For be assured there is nothing can delay
My speedy ruin, but thy speedy stay;
But since thy pleasure must be done, not mine,
Dear Amoronzo I must thus -- decline
And so farewell. Thus being almost drowned
In floods of grief, she gently kissed the ground;
With that the almost brokenhearted Lover
Whose dear affections caused him to discover
A world of sorrow, rai^'d her from the ground
And with the Balsom of a kiss made sound
Her bleeding heart, and when he had divorst
R^de Passion from her sense. He thus discourst,
Tell me my dear Celania, why do thou
Intail such sorrows on thy stormy brow,
Believe me Dearest, if I should deny
To love thy virtues, I deserved to dye:
The convertible terms of life and love
Meet both in me, my Joy, and if I prove
Unkind to thee, oh may all Plagues combine
To meet in one, and afterward prove mine;
Do thou not hear how danger does approach
And will, if not prevented, soon encroach
Upon our safeties, therefore, now, my Dear,
Let loose my close-lockt arm, and stay thou here
Till my return, which questionless will be
Crowned with the joy of happy victory,
Sigh not my Dear, believe't, each sigh propounds
Unto my Soul more then a thousand wounds,
Come let this welcome parting kiss express
And seal the assurance of a good success.
Farewell, farewell --
-- Dimagoras all this while
Stood laboring, as it were, to reconcile
Himself to his own thoughts, but wit and art
Were in-sufficient to defend his heart
From servile fear, his very Looks expressed
The dismal horror of a throbbing breast,
Although to him no danger could appear,
He feared, because he know not what to fear,
So he that should have taught Celania's heart
To rest contented, caused his own to smart
And with a trembling hand he smote his breast,
He sighed, nay worse, he sobb'd, and thus expressed.
Shall triffling honor make me to dispose
My life unto the pleasure of my Foes:
Suppose that Amoronzo chance to fall
In this encounter, how should I inthrall
Both life and safety, for when they shall see
Celania accompanied with me,
Their present fury will be sure to light
Upon my head, I Will therefore save by flight
What I shall lose by stay, but if so be
That Amoronzo should return, and see
His dear Celania weeping all alone
And I (supposed her Comforter) am gone,
What then? but I Will not stay, methinks I hear
A thousand Swords now clashing in my ear;
Farewell to Antique honor, it is at life
I aim, I hate this honorable strife,
I Will hasten to yon Cave, and there I Will lie
And hug my self in blessed security.
Dimagoras being gone, there seemed t'arise
A glimmering joy, (which blushed through ecstasies
Of grief and care) In poor Celania's face,
Glad that Dimagoras had left the place:
But this* this short-lived joy did quickly end,
Her thoughts being busied on her absent friend,
Her sad expecting heart begun to grow
Into extremes, her pallid lips let flow
A flood of language: If the Reader please
T'observe the streams, they are most sadly these.
Ah me, and then she sighed, alas, and there
She wept, sad heart, and then she dried that tear
With a suceeding sigh: Oh stormy weather!
She wept, and sighed, she sighed, and wept together,
The senseless rocks at each alternate groan
Did seem to Sympathize, and sadly moan;
My Dear, my Life she cries, my All, nay more,
If more may be, oh how I could adore
Thy empty shadow, but I wish in vain
For that which is impossible to gain,
He Is gone, he is gone, and there she wrang her hands
And tore her hair, whilst on her cheeks there stands
The fruitful Issue of her brim filled eyes,
To Emblemize her real miseries;
She breathed a while, but only to obtain
The more advantage how to grieve again.
Have ye observed a Tempest how it seems
A present calm, yet suddenly redeems
A greater force, and with a sturdy blast
Gives satisfaction for the time that is past:
Even so Celania musters up her fears,
Prologu'd with sighs, and Epilogu'd with tears,
And with full-blasted sorrow she prevails
Against her self, and thus her self assailes.
Her trembling hand tears off her flaxen hair,
And smites her Ivory breast, as if it were
Ordained for that use, and then she vents
In sighs, the grandeur of her discontents,
And then the tides of passion overflow
The banks of reason, she resolves to go
She knows not where, but yet the place seems blessed
Because it entertained so sweet a Guest
As Amoronzo, nay, the senseless ground
Where he had sat, her silent eyes had drowned
In briny floods, at last, her store being spent,
Passion prevailed, and away she went;
She went away, yet at a distant space
She often would stand, and gaze upon the place,
Fuel'd with two extremes, her Soul did burn,
First to depart, and after to return,
If she departed, then her grief would stray
Into a madness that she went aw^y,
And if she staid, sorrow would more ensnare
Her heart, for Amoronzo was not there:
Will it not prove a Paradox to say
Celania stayed, and yet she went away,
She had (poor Lady) when she did depart
Progressive feet, a retrograding heart,
But she is gone, jndg, Reader, how oppressed
Being misfortunes sad, and chiefest Guest,
What hand, what Pen can copy out her woe
That knows not where, nay, hardly how to go;
Is it not pity then to leave her here
In a strange place, where all things do appear
Like sad Conspirators and there conspire
To make encroaching misery entire;
Poor Lady I must leave her, yet I know
Her pardon will pursue me, for I go
To meet her Amoronzo, who is now
Returned with conquest shining on his brow:
But to relate the combat, or each blow
His valor, and the courage of his Foe,
Would prove too tedious, it is enough that we
Find him returned with dear-bought victory.
Accept kind Reader, what is now expressed,
When time shall ripen thou shall taste the rest.
Poor Lover, with what joy his hasty feet
Approached the place with longing hopes to meet
His dear Celania, but his nimble eye
Lightning with flamy looks, could not espy
His hearts chief Object, then his thoughts begin
To be disturbed, and mutiny within,
He now inclines to fear he knows not what,
Sometimes he thinks on this, sometimes on that,
But at the last with a dejected look
He spies her glove, which he most sadly took
And recommended to his lips, and there
Sat down, and bathed it in an amorous tear:
Thou consort of my Soul says he, what place
Is now so blessed to entertain the grace
Of thy delightful presence, oh that I
Were half so blessed to be a Stander by;
Why stay'st thou from me, and do not appear
Thou seemst far off, but yet I hope thou art near;
Wrong not my hopes, let me not be forsook,
For I am almost famished for a look,
Appear, appear, and let no longer stay
Affront my hopes (my Dearest) come away,
Ah must thy longing Amoronzo sit
Clothed with despair* why comst not, what, not yet;
Not yet, art thou asleep? Then dream my Dear,
That thy beloved Amoronzo's here,
He Is here, and laden with as much distress
As either heart can wish, or tongue express;
I Will wait a while, perhaps it is thy will
To steal upon me unawarres, and fill
My thoughts with sudden joy, thou do me wrong
For I expect too soon, thou stay'st too long:
With that, he cast his prying eyes about,
Hoping to find his dear Celania out,
But all in vain, for fortune which did mean
To dwell some time upon this troubled Scene,
Presented him an object, which indeed
Caused not his eyes to weep, but heart to bleed:
The wind, being then in love, did seem to adore,
And play with that Celania had tore
From her distracted head, I mean the fair
And bounteous wealth of her neglected hair,
Which Amoronzo spying, with a mind
Enraged he run, and snatched it from the wind;
Half mad, because quite angry, he begins
To take the wind with multiplied sins.
Thou impious nothing, how durst thou (cries he)
Play with a relic of more sanctity
Then can be uttered, if so be you must
Be sportful, go, and want onwith the dust:
But thus this Lover minding more the pleasure
Of his own fury, lost his new-got treasure;
For angry Boreas in a high disdain
Enforced it from his trembling hand again,
Away it flew, he gazed, and then begun
To start away, resolving to outrun
The winged wind, and for Celania's sake
He almost lost his breath, to win the Stake,
By this approved example we may find,
The wings of Love, are swifer then the wind.
After this first, short conflict, he retreats
Unto his former station, where he seats
His melancholy self, and then his heart
Begins to fall into the second part
Of his first grief, that sorrow, which before
Spoke all by whispers, now begins to roar,
Poor Lover, he despairs, for having found
Her gloves, her hair, her partlet on the ground*
He falls from sighs, to words, from words, to tears
From tears, to groans, and then at last despairs:
Despair, that worst of evils, now sits crowned
Queen regent in his thoughts, his thoughts abound
With several contradictions, nay, the wind
Is constant, if compared to his mind,
Sometimes he thought, for fear, she had bin fled
Into some Cave; and then, he thought her dead:
He looks upon her glove, and in conclusion
He thought himself into a sad confusion.
At last inclining to a serious pause,
He then resolved Dimagoras was the cause,
Then like a fierce Revenger, he persues
His name to death, whilst every thought renews
Revengful thoughts, and with his sharp-edg'd wrath
Wounds him with curses, stabs him with an oath,
Accursed hour (cries he) when first my eyes
Observed that Monster of all villainies,
Could not his former deeds instruct my thoughts
To have a care, could not his latter faults,
Iuduce me to distrust him, well, I Will trace
The world but I Will revenge this foul disgrace.
But ah Celania how can I expect
Thy pardon, that have used thee with neglect,
Unhandsom Fate, if Amoronzo live
Heavens grant it be to practice how to give
A due reward to him whose very name:
Paysons my Soul, and fills my cheeks with shame;
I Will run, and ransack all the world about
Not sparing, Hell it self, to find thee out,
And question not but thy malicious fate
Will still preserve thee to endure my hate;
Good fortune be my guide I Will not delay
Nor lavish time, but presently away:
Where now we will leave him, for Dimagoras cries
To be discovered in his miseries.
It so fell out that the Arcadian King
And all his Nobles, (as a usual thing
For relaxation of their minds) did ride
One day a hunting, when there was espied
A hideous Bear lie lurking in the shade
Watching her prey, but that the Huntsmen made
A near approach, and with a dexterous Art
Did almost wound this Monster to the heart:
The Bear thus wounded makes a speedy flight
Being close persu'd: The Huntsmen with delight
Observed her windings, but half spent, she took
Into a Thicket, and by chance forsook
Her close Persuers, till at last betrayed
By her own blood, the careful Huntsmen made
What speed they could, and forced her to retire
Into a Cave, whilst they forthwith conspire
T'intrape their gain, making where she should pass
A secret Concave mantl'd over with grass,
Stopping all passages, that she must stay
Close penned up in the Cave, or pass that way:
At last she roared as able to affright
The eager Huntsmen from their close delight;
But on a sudden they unstopt the Cave
Expecting by her speedy flight, to have
The end of their desires, to which intent
They watched the place and (more then usual) spent
An hour in patience, and at last surrounded
The Cave, and most confusedly they sounded
Their several Horns, but nothing could express
The lestre semblance of a quick success:
At last the impatient Huntsmen cursed and swore
At their ill fortune, thinking to give over,
But yet resolving first to seek about
Thinking their ill-lookt Prisoner might get out
At some concealed place, but when their eyes
Had satisfied their hearts, they soon devise
A new design, which questionless had caused
Th'effecting of their wills had they not paused,
Or rather started at, a sudden cry
That seemed to be, they know not where, nor why;
At last they hearkening with a stricter ear,
Being almost half astonished, did hear
A dreadful noise, which issued from the Cave
And made th'expecting Huntsmen madly rave
And curse their Fate, forbearing not to swear
It was a man enchaunted to a Bear:
Whilst they were thus discoursing, there appears
A Monster (as they thought) composed of fears,
Who, careless of himself, with speed came running
Out of the Cave, perceiving not the cunning
Of his amazed Foes, but quickly fell
As he supposed, into the jaws of Hell,
Which they perceiving, soon begun to ban,
And vow the Bear was turned into a man;
Yet for the better satisfaction, they
Ran to the Cave, where they observed there lay
The ugly Monster, buried in the flood,
The little Ocean of her reeking blood:
Finding her dead, immediately they went
Unto the King* declaring the event
Of their designs, who forthwith gave command
That they in silence for a time should stand
About the pit, and there expect that night
The future Issue of so strange a sight:
Th'obedient Huntsmen nimble to obey
Their Kings command made present speed away.
And so arriving at the place, they made
Silence their friend, which suddenly betrayed
Sad groans unto their ears, and doleful cries,
Ballast with oaths, and winged with blasphemies:
At last they heard a voice, much more enlarged
And more distinct, which suddenly discharged
It self into these words, unhappy I,
The abstract of unpattern'd villainy,
Why was I born, since all things thus agree
To make completed misery in me?
Or else is life and death late grown at odds,
Which shall torment me most? and are the Gods
Spectators of my woes? must I endure
The Plagues of two such ills, and not procure
The least refreshment? ah Parthenia, now
Thou take revenge at large, but when will thou
Abreviate my Sorrows, that I may
See but the twy-light of one smiling day;
For now I am in Hell, but here I find
No Devil but my self, and yet my mind
And Soul is tortured, nay I see no light
Nor know no darkness, my distracted sight
Possesses me with such a double being
That I am blind in light, in darkness, seeing,
And here I live perplexed with a doubt
How I got in, but harder, to get out:
How happy had I been, if I had stayed
With sad Celania in the pleasing shade,
Perhaps the Gods would then some pity take
If not for mine, for their Celania's sake;
But I, unhappy wretch, nay most unkind
Unto my friend, whose goodness was confined
To my distress, yet basely did I prove
(Prompted by fear) false to Amoronzo's Love
His dear Celania; but alas too late
I here bewail my miserable state.
Now envy, hatred, malice, all contrive
To do your worsts, but keep me not alive,
Alas I cannot grieve for what is past,
As fast as you torment, I Will curse as fast.
The Impatient Huntsmen, having thus endured
Their Kings commands, at length were well assured
The voice was humane, so, they having made
Nearer approach, they thus begun, and said.
What art thou, say what art thou, thus constraines
Our hearts to pity? who is that complains
Of his misfortune? If thou art a Man,
Desire our aid, we will help thee if we can,
Starve not the issue of a good success,
They Are fools that must be courted from distress,
Be free, and answer, let us not long expect,
Favors prove curses when they find neglect:
To which he (hearkening with a willing ear,
Timorous to speak, because afraid to hear)
At last replied: And can the Gods incline
To so much pity? ah this heart of mine
Dares not prove so much traitor to the state
I am now in, as fondly to create
The meanest re^sh of a hope, for me
That am the copy of all misery,
The Current of my woes are too too strong
To be resisted, do me not that wrong
What e're ye are* as to persuade my breast
That I shall ever be so fully blessed,
As to be meanly miserable, no,
My ebb of happiness, must never flow;
But if the pleasing Streams of sweet relief
Should drop upon me, it is beyond belief:
Alas I dare not give so large a scope
To my own thoughts, to credit my own hope;
For it is well known (especially to me)
The ground of hope is possibility:
I Will say no more, he is excused to grieve
That has no faith to hope, nor to believe:
The close Attendants hearing this discourse,
Being fully fraught, and laden with remorse,
Descend the Pit, desiring him to be
Assistant to his own felicity*
But he whose banck-rupt hopes had lately found
The horror of despair, could not propound
The least of comfort to himself, the more
He was persuaded, he the less gave over
His hellish noise --
-- Ye Furies that are sent curse
Cried he, to add unto my punishment,
Draw near and hark with what a grace I Will
And scorn these Plagues which cannot make me worse
Could ye shoot fire and brimstone from your eyes
Into my Soul, oh how I would despise
Such triffling torments, go, and blush to see
Ye are out-divel'd by my misery;
But stay, what strange, what new-created light
Is this that courteth my amazed sight?
What means this sudden change? or does a dream
Possess my brain, can nothing but extreme
Delight or grief assault me, since my Fate
Is so much checquor'd, I Will a while await,
And with a patient quietness expect
Future events, but as for your respects
That stand before me, if good fortune chance
To fall upon me, I Will not fail to advance
The merit of your worth; for though I lie
Locked in the Arms of tyrant misery,
Yet my estate and ample fortunes are
Exuberant to my wish, but I Will forbear
This fond discourse, be serious, tell me then,
Are ye not Devils in the shapes of men?
Pray tell me true? for they that go about
To do me good, must strive to help me out
Of this Infernal place, that so I may
Once more behold the pleasure of a day:
To which they said. Sir if you please to trust
Your safety in our hands, we will be just,
And by a speedy means we will set you free,
From this most sad, and blind captivity;
Follow us then, and you shall quickly know
That we intend your good, pray let us go.
Away they went, and when the welcome light
Had blessed their eyes, they all employed their sight
To gaze upon him, in whose looks they saw
That fear kept all his faculties in aw,
Away they led him to the King, and told
What they had heard, and how he did unfold
The nature of his grief, and that his heart
(For lost Celania's sake) endured a smart
Extremely great, because as he expressed,
He left her weeping woefully distressed:
He mentioned Amoronzo, and his tongue
Declared, 'twas he that did Parthenia wrong,
Which words we plainly hearing thought it* meet,
To bring him to be prostrate at the feet
Of your renowned Majesty, that so
You might by his confession truly know
Where fair Celania (your dear Niece) was fled,
To which intention we have hither led
And here we leave him, joyful that our art
Procured this news to your contr^sted heart;
At which the King with a delightful look
Commands him to him, and when he had took
A strict Survey of his most gashful face,
He knew it was Dimagoras whose disgrace
Made him so odious to the eyes of all
The Standers by, that they begun to spawl
And sp^t upon him, biding him confess
Where lost Celania was, and what distress
He left her in, and then they would incline
To moderation, and with speed, confine
Their present fury, but if he denied
What they required, he should prepare to abide
As many plagues as mischief could invent:
To which Dimagoras gave a free consent,
And said. I saw (I must confess it is true)
Both Amoronzo and Celania too,
But where they were at present did exceed
The power of his knowledge, for the speed
Of his departure, made him not enquire
Of their designs, nor where they would retire;
But Amoronzo fled, I know not why,
Nor to what place, whilst sad Celania's eye
Drenched her discolored cheeks in briny tears,
And with a storm of sighs expressed her fears,
But all in vain, for he, hard-hearted he
Slighted her sad, her groaning misery,
And so he left her (oh my heart did burn)
Without the least engagement to return.
He being gone, my weak endeavors strove
To make her quit the solatory Grove
Wherein he left her, and forbear to vent
Such floods of tears for him that was content
To leave her in distress, but all in vain,
The more I su'd, the less she would retain
The good of my persuasions, but did woe
My present absence, that her grief might flow
Without controlement, so at last I took
Unwilling leave, and presently forsook
The dismal place, and left her close confined
To the strict limits of a troubled mind,
Poor Lady, thus I left her all alone
For ah her looks engaged me to be gone,
And this is all my knowledge can relate
Of her (poor Lady) too too ridged state,
To which the King, with an enraged brow
Replied, if this be all you can allow
Our expectations, you shall be our guest
Till time and torture make you speak the rest;
Haste him away, our leisure shall compose
A plot to make him speak the truth he knows.
Where now we will leave him and transplant our eyes
From his, to more concerning miseries,
I mean our sad Celania, whose distress
May cost you tears to read, me to express.
The end of the first Book.
THE Second Book.
COme sad Melpomene, it is thy part
To teach me to decipher such a heart
As sorrow never knew, nor envious Fate
Could ever dare to boast of, till of late;
Come, give me tears for ink, and ink, for tears;
An iron pen, that may ingrave the fears,
The woes of our Celania: Come, be brief,
A world of tears may drown a world of grief:
And you sad hearted Ladies that have known
Th'extreams of love, let now your tears be shown;
It is, methinks, the least that ye can do,
(For every word) to drop a tear or two.
Sighs, tears, and groans, were ever known to be
Loves proper Method, Cupids Diarie
Confirms this ruth, moreover, he declares
That Lovers hearts are circumscribed with cares;
If any justly can this truth deny,
It Is Cupid's in an error, and not I.
The Streams of Love run swifter than -- but stay
Hark, our Celania groans, my Muse, away.
Bad tidings makes sad hearts, th'unwelcom news
Of her unheard of sufferings cannot choose
But raise a tempest in each tender heart;
For she, poor Lady, felt th'increasing smart
Of Amoronzo's absence, and her breath
Proclaimed his absence was the present death
Of all her comforts, and she wept, as 'twere
By Patent, Sealed with sad and black despair;
'Twas she that taught the Turtle how to morn
For her absented Mate, 'twas she, forlorn,
Distressed Lady, that did first entice
The twatling Echo to the avarice
Of imitation, every groan she spent
Out of the Storehouse of her breast, was sent
Trebbl'd into the world. The Echo took
Such pleasure in her name, that she forsook
Her natural voice, but yet she was to blame
So much to wanton with her amorous name
Had Amoronzo heard it, earth had bin
Too small a circle to contain him in,
Nay, and Celania too, would often cry,
Who dare use Amoronzo's name but I;
And thus this babbling Nymph would still proclaim
And run division on his pleasing name,
As if she had (for poor Celania's sake)
Cried him throughout the world, but could not make
Return of his abode, so by consent
They both agreed to groan in discontent,
Under the shadow of a spreading tree,
Whose drooping branches made it seem to be
A Nursery of grief, Celania placed
Her melancholy life, whose presence graced
The kindness of the place, which now seemed blessed
In entertaining so divine a Guest.
But by and by, there chanced to pass that way
A greedy Lion, roaring for his prey,
Who gazing on Celania, made a stand
(As if her eyes had given counter-mand
To his designs) and star'd upon her face,
Whilst she, whose Innocence gave a grace
To every look, undauntedly expressed
A welcome entertainment to her Guest:
But see what graceful Majesty does lie
Within the circuit of a harmless eye;
The Lion seemed so satisfied, that he
Forgot to hunger, and began to be
As 'twere enamored, and would not commence
His bloody suite against her Innocence,
But fawning on her, seemed to express
An inward sorrow for her sad distress,
Sad Lady, she amazed at the sight
Begun as 'twere to take some sad delight
In her Companion, and would gently clap
His sturdy head which in her tender lap
He softly laid, by which we truly see
The Lion and the Lamb may well agree:
Nor yet could this strange accident remove
Her wandering thoughts from her endeared Love,
But still her tears were sadly subsequent
Unto her sighs: at last away she went,
Leaving (as she supposed) her fawning friend
Locked up in sleep --
She had not paced much ground, but she espied
Two, which in running toward her, had discry'd
The plenty of her beauty, which enforced
Their speedy stay, who staying, thus discoursed.
It Is not to court you Madam, nor to stray
Into vain words enforced us to this stay,
But it is to enjoy our pleasures, therefore do
What our persuasions shall advise you to,
Or else we shall (to shorten our discourse)
What you deny to yield, command by force,
At which the Lady (half distracted) cried
I will not yield, nor can the Gods abide
So much impiety, but they will send
A speedy vengeance, e're ye can befriend
Or satisfy your lusts, the Gods are just,
And hate, although it be well worded lust,
Therefore desist, except ye will proceed
Unto my death, for that is the nobler deed;
Kill me, and welcome, but defile me not,
Lust is a living stain, and death no blot:
To which they both most desperately replied
They that resolve to do cannot abide
The least persuasions, yield, and so deprive
Danger of sad effects, nay do not strive
Nor cry, for know, this dismal place affords
No ears to entertain imploring words,
Yield then without compulsion: Give me leave
Replied Celania, ere ye do bereave
And rob me of my treasure, but to take
A silent leave of what I must forsake,
And then I shall submit unto your lust,
Or yield my self a Sacrifice to dust:
She stepped aside, and cried, Heaven be my shield,
I neither dare, nor can, nor will I yield*
Look up, look up vile Creatures, and behold
A swelling Cloud even ready to unfold
It self in vengeance, for ye may be sure
The Gods will not behold, and yet endure,
Desist, and let your passions be allayed
For they will shield what they themselves have made,
I mean mine innocence, and therefore know
I will be chaste because they made me so,
And they which truly call upon the Gods
In their distress, have more than trebble odds
Against their Foes. --
-- You rather blow the fire
By this discourse, then quench our hot desire
They both replied, come, come, we have done wrong
To our desires in keeping them so long
Without their natural food, nay do not strive,
Let virtue dye, but keep your self alive:
Nay leave those tempting cries, for know, that ear
You call unto, is deaf, and will not hear;
Heaven is a great way off: 'Twill so appear
To you in mercy, but in Judgment, near,
Replied Celania; for I Am sure, and know
The Gods are just in all their actions -- Oh,
And as she cried that Oh, Oh they discry'd
A roaring Lion which did soon divide
Their thoughts from their intents, for they begun
To leave their base beginnings and to run
To save their lives, repenting of their crime,
(Strange alteration in so short a time!)
But she, poor Lady, laden with remorse
Did, whilst her time permitted, thus discourse.
I grieve, said she, to see the state you are in,
Heavens couchant Judgment, finds your rampant sin,
Think not t'avoyd by running what ye'l meet
Your hands are now more useful then your feet:
It Is truth, they both replied, and now we must
Jointly confess the Gods are good and just:
But see ou^ Executioner draws nigh,
And we must yield, for it is in vain to fly;
With that the Lady (being pity struck)
Observe, says she, I Will charm him with a look,
He shall not hurt; for know, the Gods can be
To pity, as to punish equal free;
With that, as if her eyes had sent a charm
Into the Tyrants heart, he did no harm,
But gently laid him at her feet, to show
The humble meekness of a Convert Foe.
Even as the wretch condemned, that finds reprieve
Cannot at present well forget to grieve,
But with a quivering heart, does first display
The colors of his joy; even so did they
(Both timorously joyful) thus proclaim
The goodness of Celania, and their shame.
Admired goodness, that can thus engage
The angry Gods to mitigate their rage
To us, that by just Judgment were decreed
To speedy death, but by free mercy, freed!
For which (most divine Lady) unto you
(After the Gods) we must acknowledge due
The mercy of our lives, for our attempt
We here confess, most justly might exempt
Your heart from pity, but in you, we found
A sovereign Balsom, in our selves a wound,
A deadly wound, which to departing breath
Is far more harsh, more terrible then death,
We see our grim-lookt Martial, how he lies
Subjected at your feet, and dare not rise
To execute that fury which is prone
To him by nature, but does now disowne
Nature it self, converted to fulfill
The gracious pleasure of your virtuous will.
Oh what a sudden alteration's bred!
Here lies a Lion, but his nature's fled!
But Madam, since it is so, that unto you
The worthless tribute of our lives are due,
Command us what you please, and you shall find
Us ready, nay, and winged like the wind
To execute your pleasure, Madam, these
Are only words, command us what you please,
And by our quick obedience you shall see
The true effects of our integrity,
Enjoin us to some penance, that we may
T'expiate our crimes be forced to obey,
For (pardon our boldness Madam) we discry
Hard, and misterious Characters in your eye,
Which we, by your permission, will unfold,
And tell you that which never yet was told:
We Will take the liberty without consent
To say, we know you groan in discontent,
And so does he, that is the daily food
Of your affections, Madam, it is not good
To dwell upon delays; in short, we know
You love even to despair, and that your woe
Is bleeding new. And that it may appear,
Madam, believe, that Amoronzo's here,
I mean in wish, I would not have him nigh,
Except his dear Celania were by,
Whom we suppose you are, or else his tongue
By false description, Madam, did you wrong;
For 'twas our hapless fortunes to be near
Unto his groans, when we did sadly hear
The thunder of his passion (oh hard hap)
And then a sigh would usher in each clap
Like flames or lightning* sometimes he would say,
My Dearest, oh divine Celania!
Here, here, thy tortured Amoronzo lies
Bewitched to death by his own miseries:
Do not believe thy self, if thou should chance
To think me cruel, let thy thoughts advance
To better notions, ah my Dearest, know
The Gods can testify, it is not so,
Heaven knows I love thee -- There he stopped, and then
Even like a Torrent he brake forth again
And thus expressed. --
-- What Love-sick-God has made
An errand from the Heavens, and thus betrayed
My Dearest from me, oh it was unkind
Unkindly done, to leave me here behind
To weep her absence, well, the Gods may frown
But I Will unseile the Heavens, and reach her down;
I cannot breath, for she that is my breath
Is ravished from me, and is now my death,
And there -- oh what, replied Celania, what
If it be death, be sparing, name it not,
Such stories please me not: Then Madam, know
There he left off to speak, but not to flow
In floods of tears, he being thus distressed,
We ran unto him, made it our request
To know the reason of his grief, but he
With a mixed look, replied* do ye not see
Can ye not spell my miserable state
(Far easier to endure, than to relate,)
Perplex me not with questions, but be brief,
And tell me, can you mitigate my grief?
Can ye inform me, where th'indeared Guest
Of my now widdowed, melancholy breast
Makes her abode, if this ye can assure me,
Ye'l prove Physicians, and for ever cure me:
Within the fatal confines of this place
I left her with a Villain, whose disgrace
Black Hell does seem to blush at, nay, and I
(The woeful Author of her tragedy)
Am buried in despair, oh horrid truth
Dimagoras was a Villain from his youth;
But I Will pursue the Traitor, nay unhinge
The Cerbrean gates, and bring him to revenge.
Murder does nonplus Hell, which knows not how
To get provisioary Plagues enough
To punish it, but stay, behold, oh see
These are the grounds of my just misery,
(Showing Celania's Partlet, Gloves, and hair)
Then judge, have I not reason to despair
Says he. Thus having lavishly expended
His profuse rage, he tore his hair, and ended,
And there we left him, Madam, having now
Expressed the truth we know, we further bow
To your commands, believe it, we assure
Our selves, that you do equally endure
The like misfortune, neither do we doubt
By your permission but to find him out,
Or else we will lose our selves in the pursuit,
Then let your Faith increase, and be not mute,
Your silence tells us that you love, and we
By our own confidence resolve it is he,
It Is him you love, then please for his dear sake
To be persuaded, and some pity take
Upon your self, believed, those blushes do
Confirm, what we have told you, must be true,
Nay, and the more t'establish your belief,
We Will tell you what we are --
-- Then know in brief
We are Arcadians, and from thence we came
Being empowered in your Uncles name
(Our royal King) to ransack all about
To see if we could find Celania out;
We had not long pursued, but by a chance
We heard which way, and how you did advance
With Amoronzo, so we soon forsook
Our lazy pace, and suddenly o'retook
Your most renowned Lover, whose report
For feats of Arms, shall spread about the Court
At our return, although it much redown
To our disparagement, to heap renown
Upon a Stranger, and eclipse that glory
Which ought to advance the credit of our story;
If Mars had come in person to oppose
And give encounter to so many Foes
So well appointed, he had quickly known
The Unhappy Fate of being overthrown;
For Amoronzo (much like lightning) flew
About our ears, and in a moment slew
Our stoutest Leaders: Nothing could assuage
Or quench the fire of his consuming rage;
Our lives were only saved, but not by slight,
Or feats of Arms, but by a timely flight,
So that we must confess our lives were due
To Amoronzo first, and now to you,
For which, as duty binds us, we shall be
Faithful to you in this extreamitie,
But Madam, let us crave, before we fall
To our intentions, that you would recall
Those ill opinions of us which do rest
Within the Realm of your disturbed breast*
Believe us then, we did it but to try
And prove the effects of your known Chastity,
And if this be not truth which we declare,
Then may your grim-Attendant cease, and tear
Our perjured hearts: Now Madam, if you please
To walk to more convenience, and ease
Your wearied body, we will forthwith try
Our chiefest skills, to bring a quick supply
Of comfort to you, and we hope to find
A Balsom to refresh your troubled mind:
To which Celania without further oath
(Made confident by knowledge of them both)
Replied -- Extremes of grief and care has made
This alteration in me, and betrayed
The freedom of my Spirit, yet I dare
With confidence assure my self, we are
Relations to my Uncle, whose severe
And more then usual passions, made me fear
The weight of his displeasure, which you know
Falls heavy: Heaven protect me from a Foe
So wrapped in fury, that he is by odd,
Far more implacable than the Gods,
Nor do I think it possible for Art
T'allay the flames of his incensed heart,
And were it in my choice, I Would choose to dye
Rather than feel the lightning of his eye;
Therefore, as I suppose, it is much in vain
To waste your time in laboring to obtain
The renovation of his Love. What thing
Can be more fierce than an incensed King;
This Lion, if compared to him, may be
Esteemed a Lamb, experience let us you see
That he is pitiful; therefore, return
And leave me here alone, that I may burn
In my own flames: Thus let us end this strife,
Who brings me Amoronzo, brings me life:
The noble Knights (for so they were) replied,
Madam, this truth, is not to be denied,
Which you have uttered; but since your distress
As we conceive, requires a quick redress,
Be pleased t'accept those proffers which will tend
To your advantage, Madam, do not spend
More time, in more delays, the homely place
Of my abode, is not above the space
Of half a League, which by our help, you may
Quickly approach to, Madam, let us away,
And be assured that you shall command
As free an entertainment as will stand
With my estate: Celania, heavy-hearted,
Consented slowly, slowly, she departed;
Where now we will leave them for a time, and treat
Upon Dimagoras, who is now complete
In his distress, being business'd in a strife
Whether to kill himself, or lose his life
By condemnation; for it so fell out
That the Lyconians gave a total rout
To the Arcadian Army, and pursued
Their victory, until they had subdued
Their chief Commanders, and at last they sent
Unto the Arcadian King, to know the intent
Of his proceedings, whether he would yield
To their desires, they having won the field;
To which the enraged King sent this reply.
Know ye Lyconians that I much defy
To yield, till death requires, nor is it all
Your strength can make me yield unto your call,
As for your Lord Dimagoras, who is now
My Captive, I will quickly make him bow
To my commands, his head, his head shall be
The Prophecy of future victory
To my recruited Army, therefore know
I am your hearty, your undaunted Foe,
KALANDER.
Having dispatched this Message, he retires
And (as his speed commands him) soon requires
The Assistance of his Council, to advise
Which way to steer iu these extreamities;
Who being met, considering well the speed
Of their occasions, gravely thus proceed:
Most sacred Sir, perpending well the state
You now are in, we boldly thus debate,
And first grave Sir, we humbly do propose
Life for Dimagoras; because your Foes
Being flesht with victory, will quickly be
(If not opposed by potent policy)
Upon your quarters, therefore we will prepare
And make the best advantage of his fear,
We have already, strongly noised about
That you have lately gave a total rout
To the Lyconian Army, and this news
Being posted to his ears, sure cannot choose
But fright him into any thing, it is known
His mungrel disposition dare not own
The least misfortune, therefore we will present
To him (as 'twere by Lanskip) your intent:
We will employ an Agent who shall speak
By circumambitues, and flyly break
The Ice of your desires, by which we will find
Which way the Byas of his tortured mind
Does most incline: Thus having laid the ground
Of our designs, we quickly can propound
What Fabric to erect, fear seldom's clad
With reason to distinguish good from bad;
Therefore, most sacred Sir, if you approve
Of our advice, we quickly will remove
Your now-incroaching Foes; for we will indite
And make Dimagoras sign to what we write,
We therefore wait your pleasure --
-- To which the King
Gravely replied, I fear 'twill prove a thing
Of small effect; Lyconia does afford
But mean respects to him, although their Lord;
Suppose he should command them to retire
A League, or two, they would laugh at his desire,
For they are now in arms, and are made bold
By victory, and what they get, they will hold:
'When Subjects once get head, they bid farewell
'To duty, make it conscience to rebel;
'The sword knows no obedience, for it makes
'Disloyalty a Law, and rudly shakes
'Truths Fundamentals, seldom wanting friends
'To brandish it into sinister ends;
Therefore I well conceive that it is unfit
To act by him that has not power, nor wit;
For though it be State policy, we know
To seem unwise, it is madness, to be so;
For Statesmen must, like watermen still show
Their faces Eastward, when they Westward row:
But to the purpose, it is our only way
To labor, by contrivance, how to play
Our after gain, giving them blots by flight,
Which if they hit, they fall, we stand upright:
You know, I sent for aid, which I expect
Within few days, therefore I Will not neglect
To prosecute my ends; for I intend
If Fate permit, this very night to send
My Carriages before, and when the Sun
Gives them intelligence, I Will seem to run
With these my scattered forces, but I Will leave
This Garrison well manned, for I perceive
That they intend a siege, and to pursue
With their remaining force, which if they do,
I Will fly with speed to the Olympian Plains
And join with those recrutes, which there remains
In expectation of me, if the event
Prove well, thank Heaven, for this is my intent:
As for Dimagoras, I will prepare
An Antidote, he shall not dye with fear,
I Will cure him with a Message, which shall be
Welcome, being ballast with his liberty,
He shall have freedom to enjoy the air
Under a watchful eye lest he despair
And so we lose him; for it is my intent
To make Dimagoras finish the event
Be what it will: It Is policy to have
In such uncertainties, a royal Slave:
Delay breeds danger, let us away, I long
To be in action; Courage makes us strong.
Reader, I crave thy favor to excuse
My quick retreat; for know my timorous Muse
Is not so military to withstand
The dreadful thunderings of a Martial hand;
For she complains that Mars was once before
Discourteous to her, and she will fight no more
Except -- but hark, who calls? Celania, how
Celania call? then Reader turn thy brow
From Mars to Venus, for Mars seldom saves,
Nor gives he any other Crowns then Graves:
We Will leave him for a time, and if there be
Occasion that we must return and see
His well flesht shambles, we will not fear nor run,
It Is better far to see, then feel what is done.
All you whose Virgin-hearts have never known
The painful issues of a Love sick groan,
Draw near; and you, whose barren eyes did never
Let fall a tear, come now, and weep for ever;
And you, whose infant eyes could never prove
Or speak the proper Dialects of Love,
Approach, for here are to be taught in brief,
Your hearts, your eyes, your tongues, the rules of grief,
Here breaths your lively copy, you may see
The exact portraiture of misery;
Observe how every Linament does speak
Its excellency, and attempts to break
More hearts then she has woes, whose dismal cry
Eccho's; alas, I Am griefs Anatomy,
See how she is disected, how each part
Of her much wounded, yet more constant heart.
Lies open to your view, and how each vein
U^rpt by death, lies bleeding to obtain
That boodstone of her Soul, I mean, her dear
Her dearest Amoronzo, who is more near
Unto her Soul, then all the wealth that can
Be apprehended by the thoughts of Man,
It Is he must cure my pains, says she, or I
Must laguish in his absence, pine, and dye:
These were Celania's groans, which had more
And more enlarged, had not the fast locked door
Received a sudden knock, which made her stay
The current of her grief, and haste away
To give an entrance, but her thoughts begin
To mutiny, unwilling to let in
Unwelcome news, so drawing back her hand,
Her trembling hand, she made a sudden stand;
And gazing toward the door, she said, must I
Must I be Porter to my misery;
No, no I will not, yet I will -- but stay,
I dare not, oh I dare not, why? I may
And will, I will; Misfortune do thy worst,
I may be made more blessed, not more accursed:
With that scarce knowing what she did, she run
Unto the door, and hastily begun
To turn the Key, but e're she could fulfill
The senseless pleasure of her captived will,
She heard a voice, a voice, that seemed to bear
(Being made more sad, more terrible by fear)
A dreadful horror, and it seemed to cry
Harken Celania, harken to what I
Shall say, fear not, for know, my Message gives
This comfort, that your Amoronzo lives,
He lives, but I must tell, what is sadly true,
Void of all comforts, but the thoughts of you:
Yet know Celania, it is my business hither
To tell you that you must meet both together.
But where, or when, or how, that must be hid
From both, because I strictly am forbid,
Yet this I Will say; it will be ere the Sun
(Times painful journey-man) has fully run
His three days course; but I must sadly say,
Ye will not know each other, and that day
Will prove unfortunate; for one whose name
Stands now recorded in the rolls of shame,
Will by an accident, betray and bring
You both before the presence of the King:
These things must happen, and you will not do well
T'endeavour a prevention: So farewell.
Who ever saw a trance revived Soul
With what a sad aspect his lips condole
His ridged Fate, that he must live to be
As it were enjoined t'imbrace his misery?
Even so Celania waking from her trance
Craved pity by each look, and did advance
Her drooping head, then for a time she stood
As loath t'acquaint her self with flesh and blood,
But at the last, death. which did seem before
To sojourn in her eyes, did now restore
Life's due prerogatives, but I Will not wrong
The real truth (though rare) to say, her tongue
Was first in motion, for her hands, her eyes
Did seem to descant on her miseries:
It Is more then strange, her sorrows wanting vent
And grown quite lawless, had not tore and rent
Her grapling Soul, each sigh which did depart
Seemed (like a boisterous storm) to tear her heart
Up by the roots, at last, her sighs made way
For words (like Pyoneers) and without stay
She thus proceeded --
-- Since the powers above
Have thus resolved to contradict my Love,
It will prove vain to strive, the Gods will do
What their firm resolutions prompt them to:
Ah must these eyes of mine behold and see
My Amoronzo, and not know it is he,
Impossible! for sure there cannot rise
So great a mist before my feeble eyes:
Lovers are eyed like Lyncius, can discover
Though walled about, their real hearted Lover:
But stay, what should this dark Enigma show
(Strange kind of riddle) see, and yet not know,
Oh miserable happiness! sad Fate!
See, and not know, did ever wit create
A greater mistry, well, I Am sure that I
Shall know him, though it be by Sympathy,
It Is neither time nor Art can so much change
My Amoronzo's looks as to estrange
Or hid him from my knowledge, for my heart
Retains his true effigies, and no art
Can so disguise him, but even like the Sun
(The worlds great eye) that may be overrun
And clothed with Clouds, yet sure it cannot be
Changed in aspect, but we must know it is he;
But were this all, ah then my raging grief
Might in some sort be subject to relief,
But ah my sorrows more and more rebel
Against my Soul, and rings a doleful knell
To all my comforts, nothing can prevent
The rude incursions of my discontent:
Judge Ladies, judge, if ever grief could be
More acted to the life then it is in me,
Observe my Laborinths, and if ye find
The relish of a comfort in my mind,
Judge me to more extremes, if art can show
A way to make a more exuberous woe
Then mine, inflict it on me, let your eyes
Weep me to death, or drown my miseries,
I care not which; oh tell me is it not woe
More then enough, to see, and yet not know
My Amoronzo: here is a flaming rod,
Here Is grie^s full stop, but not her period.
Sad consequence, I see there is no reason
In grief, that loves to tyrannize by treason!
Oh pevish Fate, why do thou thus devise
New ways, new means, new woes to tyrannize!
But Heaven prevent the Traitor, may his death
Betray the treason, or his feeble breath
Want utt'rance to express it, Heaven defend
My Amoronzo from so base an end,
But if it be decreed; The Gods are just
In taking both, we will marry in the dust,
The grave shall swell with mirth, our lofty tomb
Shall be both nuptial bed and dining room,
The worms shall be our Guests, nay, they shall be
Both Mask and Music to our jollitie;
We Will revell in our ashes, lively death
Shall dance for joy, then having taken breath
Shall post away, and thus nights vail being spread,
The Curtains drawn by time, we will shrink to bed:
Rest then my heart, purchase a free content,
Observe with care, and thou shall see the event
Come fluttering on the wings of time, it is near,
It Is near, and will with winged speed appear:
With that (the Rose and Lilly being met)
I mean her hand and cheek, she seemed to let
Her eyelids slumber, but she could command
No pleasing rest; for in her eyes did stand
Grief's watchmen (tears) so in an angry vain
She snatched her Lute, and thus begun to strain
Her Magic voice, I cannot well say whether
She wept, and sung, she sung and wept together.
CELANIA'S Song.
COme gentle Lute, and let us relate
In warbling Notes my ridged Fate,
That these (now senseless) walls and stones
Hearing my well divided groans,
May from their dullness frightened be
Into a sensibilitie,
And hearing, say, I Have reason to bewail
That am both Ocean, Tempest, Ship, and Sail.
2.
I am an Ocean, and my eyes
Send me (like Rivolets) supplies
Only in this, unlike the Main,
I flow, but never ebb again,
My brackish tides cannot return
Nor drown (like that) but always burn:
And thus my sorrows license me to weep,
My eyes (though narrow Seas) are very deep.
3
I am a Tempest, and I know
There seldom comes a calm in woe,
When Boreas harbors in a breast,
It Is fondness then to think on rest,
And needs must they be void of peace,
Whose tempests never, never cease:
Then blame me not when thus my storms arise,
To strive t'allay them with my raining eyes.
4
I am a Ship full fraught with fears
Tossed in the Ocean of my tears,
Rackt in a storm of sighs I run
Upon the Rocks, and am undone;
My Pilot's lost, I know not where,
And I am buried in despair.
Thus am I brought unto deaths fatal brink,
My Pilot being lost I needs must sink.
5
I am a Sail, and every hour
Submits me to the lawless power
Of Boreas, whose most envious breath
Assaults, and tares me unto death.
Needs must he have a stormy mind
That Is subject unto every wind.
Then blame me not that thus my woes bewail,
That am both Ocean, Tempest, Ship, and Sail.
Thus having ended (may I say) her Song
Her tears (like swelling Surges) grew too strong
For her restraint, and fain she would have vented
More vocal grief, hut that her eyes prevented
And drowned her speech, yet she was heard to cry,
Sum all misfortune up, and that am I.
Where now we will leave her pickled in her tears,
Oppressed with sighs, and buried in her fears;
For now the Knight's returned, and in his eye
Dwells the sad Character of misery.
Each look imports misfortune; he enquires
After Celania's welfare, and retires
In private with his Lady, to relate
His fruitless progress, and the unhappy Fate
Of Amoronzo, who as fame assured
Was lost at Sea, after he had endured
A fearful Shipwreck: This unwelcom news
Floated in tears: alas, and who can choose
But lend a drop, poor Lady, who shall keep
Celania company in tears, or weep
Equivolent streams, the Knight, who having paid
The tribute of his eyes, looked up, and said
What Is best to do, which way shall we contrive
T'express this fatal news, and keep alive
Our Guest, Celania; for I Am sure, that breath
That u^^e^s his, proclaims aloud, her death:
Come then, resolve, man's judgment must resign
In these extremes unto the Feminine?
What shalll we do? for if misfortune should
Reveal Celania to the King, it would
Be my destruction, or if I should go
Unto the King, and utter what I know,
He might reward me; but the horrid name
Of Traitor fills me with insulting shame,
I dare not, oh I cannot prove a death
To her whose virtue priviledg'd my breath.
To which the Lady thus replied --
-- it is true
I apprehend what dangers may accrue
By our concealment, yet I Will rather be
A Prostitute to all extreamitie
Then let my name (the jewel of my age)
Bear treasons image, what can more enrage
The Heavens then treason; I could well afford
To curse each letter, of so damned a word;
But since it is thus, if you (my Lord) think fit
To trust this business to a woman's wit,
I shall endeavor both with speed and care
T'extenuate Celania's, and your fear,
And thus I will contrive: First then present
Your self unto her, let no discontent
Dwell on your brow, it is easy to discry
The afflicted hearts distemper by the eye,
Then have a care (my Lord) and let each word
Be bitter sweet, that so you may afford
Equal of both, for if you should declare
His certain death, 'twould fill her with despair,
Or if with too much joy you should relate
The happy tidings of his prosperous Fate,
'Twould so transport her, that no skill nor art
Will moderate the raptures of her heart;
'For it is well known that women's minds are such,
'That they must neither joy, nor grief too much.
But to proceed, you having thus declared
Your doubtful mind, there shall be soon prepared
An ancient Pilgrim, who may by his wise
Discourse, aleviate her miseries:
Our house has bin (my Lord) these three days blessed
In giving entertainment to this Guest
He is a man, except his tongue belie
His heart, judicious in Divinity,
He Is sparing in discourse, yet kind to all,
Gravely facetious, sweetly musical,
Nay, and Celania wished, that she might be
A consort in his pleasing melody,
And he as often (noting her distress)
Has wished her griefs might find a quick redress;
To which intent he told me, if his skill
Might any way be useful to fulfill
Or ^urther her desires, that she should find
A readiness, crowned with a cheerful mind,
If she intended) as he thought) to be
Shrouded within a sacred Nunnerie,
Which in my judgment very well may suit
With her condition, and in time confute
Her powerful adversary, grief, which now
Usurps, and sits in triumph on her brow:
(Poor Lady) when at last this news is spread
That Amoronzo, her life's life is dead
What can she do but dye? 'twould be hard measure
Only who dies for Love, sure dies for pleasure*
But stay, farewell, let us follow our design,
Act you your part (my Lord) I Will warrant mine.
Away they went, the Knight without delay
Composed his countenance, and took his way
To visit sad Celania, who then sat
Disconsolate, as if she had forgot
She lived, till at the last she heard one say
Madam, be pleased to cast your eye this way
Upon your Servant who has thus made bold
T'intrude, unlicenc'd, Madam, please to hold
Your self contented, let not sorrow have
The whole dominion of your thoughts, but save
Some room for Amoronzo --
-- Have ye seen
The Prisoner at the bar striving between
Hope and despair, with what a piercing eye
He views his Judges, fearing to discry
His death, clothed in their looks: Even so did she,
Poor Lady, strive to read her destiny
Regester'd in his looks; stand still she cries,
That I may read my ruin in your eyes,
The Characters are legible, I know
How to spell death it self, and construe woe:
First in your face (my Lord) is to be read
A tragic story: Amoronzo's dead,
He Is dead, my Lord, nor shal't be long before
I Will follow; claspe your book, I Will read no more,
And thus I Will finish life's accursed sum
I come my Amoronzo -- Dear -- I come.
Hold Madam, spare your life, he is not dead
Replied the Lord, you only have misread
And made a false construction in my looks,
Madam, pray read again, or burn the books;
He is not dead, the Fates have now decreed
To make you happy: How! nay then proceed
Replied Celania, will the Gods at last
Take pity on a wretch that is overcast
With black despair, what shall I wish to give
In recompense: Does Amoronzo live?
His name creates new life; for now I find
A new creation in my infant mind;
Oh how grown in comfort, every minute
Brings me a Heaven, and Amoronzo in it;
See where he comes, Love, lend me wings to fly
Into his bosom, come my joy, draw nigh,
Embrace thine own Celania, oh how blessed
Am I, Love never found so sweet a rest.
The Lord (unused to Love sick raptures) knew
Not what to say, but suddenly he flew
Like lightning from her presence, where he met
The Lady and the Pilgrim, who were set
To wait her longed-for coming, that they might
Entice her to some musical delight,
But Fate designed it otherwise, for now
They all complot, and jointly study how
To wean her from her raptures, and at last
The Pilgrim (sadly hearing what was past)
Being filled with pity, took his Lute, and went
Near to her Chamber, where he forthwith sent
His airy Messengers unto her ear
To summon all her senses to appear
Before his melody, at last, she raised
Her drooping head, and after she had gazed
About the room; where is (said she) my Dear,
What, stole away, and left Celania here?
Or was it but a dream? but hark, that hand
Which plays, is his, and sure I understand
Each pleasing touch, but stay, what voice is this,
I Will swear it is an Angels, or else his,
It Is his, and he is mine: I Will rest content
To hear his Song, and then expect the event.
The Pilgrims Song.
1
SAil gentle Soul, the wind blows fair
Despair is buried in despair;
For wind and tide now seem to court
And lead us to our wisht-for port,
The wanton Billows seem in state to dance
To see our safe, our blessed deliverance.
2
The Pilot smiles, the Ship prevails,
The storm submits, the swelling sails
Puffed up with Pride, does seem to run
More then Post-haste to kiss the Sun.
Then cease sad heart, thou need not to bewail,
For thou art neither Tempest, Ship, nor Sail.
The Song thus finished, Celania calls
Her thoughts in question, and she forthwith falls
Into a serious study, well, says she,
I cannot be mistaken, sure it is he,
Or I am not my self, both voice, and hand
Invite my tortured Soul to understand
It must be he, but oh that I could see
That Saint, which gave this voice that liberty;
Impatience hates delay, I must be bold
In spite of modesty; I cannot hold
But must attempt: Ye Fates prove not unkind,
The eye, not ear, must satisfy the mind:
With that, with Eagle-speed (she that before
Could hardly creep) now flies unto the door,
Which being open, suddenly her eye
Surveys each corner, but could not espy
The treasure of her heart, but having found
Her hopes in vain, she fell upon the ground,
Being intranc'd, the Pilgrim that had viewed
Her passion (though unseen himself) pursued
His resolutions, so with speed he takes
His Lute, and with a willing heart he makes
A near approach, and sent unto her ears
(As if he had Epitomized the Spheres)
Such Heav'n-bred strains, that in dispite of death
He re-inforc'd her to her former breath,
This being done, she gently moved her head,
Which was reposed upon too hard a bed.
Oh that my Soul had wings, she cries, that I
Might quit these vain delusions, and fly
To my delight, this world affords no treasure
To me, but base-bred joys, and spurious pleasure;
Oh that I could -- with that a sudden glance
Betrayed the Pilgrim to her eyes, whose chance
It was t'observe her, as the purple dye
Usurpt her cheeks; she blushed, but knew not why,
And yet the more she labored to restrain
Her blushes, still the more she blushed again;
At last, with bashful modesty, she raised
Her feeble self, stood still awhile, and gazed
Upon the Pilgrim, who admired the grace
And majesty united in her face,
Whilst she, did equally admire to see
So much of meekness, clothed in gravitie;
Resolving then, that pity needs must rest
In such a Soul; she thus her thoughts expressed.
Grave Sir, says she, although it disagree
Unto my Sex to take the liberty
Of speech, before required, yet I depend
Upon your liberal goodness to befriend
My errors with a pardon, that I may
Return deserved thanks, and haste away,
To which the Pilgrim --
-- Madam, if your haste
Depend upon my pardon, I shall waste
Some time before I grant it; for I have
An humble favor, which I needs must crave;
My hopes assure me you will not deny
To crown my wishes; Madam pray reply.
To which Celania: Sir, it is not best
To grant, before I know what you request,
Yet my assured confidence is such,
That you will neither ask, I grant, too much;
Therefore propose your will: Then Madam, know
I have observed, nay copied out your woe,
In which (excuse my boldness) I do find
The sad extremes of a tormented mind,
Therefore be pleased to say (for I respect
The cause, there is no judging by the effect)
The reason of your grief, whith once being known
The cure is more then half perfection:
Stand not to ruminate, but be assured
What you relate, shall safely be secured
Within the strong-senc'd bull-wark of my heart,
Not to be taken by the force of Art:
Believe it Madam, and from that belief
Derive to me the reason of your grief:
I am a Pilgrim, treason cannot dwell
More in my breast, than in a Hermits Cell,
My calling makes me bold, and I must say
Your Conscience ought t'inforce you to obey;
Some days have passed since these mine aged eyes
Have truly witnessed your extremities,
And it is my Conscience bids me to require
The reason: Madam, this is my desire;
Or if my Judgment or my Reason fail,
I have a Conscience that will stand my Bail,
Nay weep not Lady, lay aside those fears
I understand your tongue, but not your tears,
Tears are good signs, but words are understood
More in one breath, then tears are in a flood;
I could drop tear for tear, but to what use?
Tears in some sense are only words excuse;
It Is a known truth, that Nature, which affords
An eye for tears, has given tongue for words;
Therefore be pleased as long as I stand by,
To let your tongue be flowing, not your eye.
To which Celania, after she had dried
Her watery eyes, looked up, and thus replied.
Grave Sir excuse me that I must deny
At present, what you claim as courtesy;
For my disordered thoughts cannot invent
As yet away t'express my full intent,
But be assured time shall not lose much sand
Before your heart shall fully understand
The nature of my grief; for I will throw
My life into your hands, and then bestow
It as you please; In the mean time consent
To grant my pardon, and I Will rest content:
And so all peace attend you, may your eyes,
See as much joys, as mine have miseries.
The end of the second Book.
THE Third Book.
POst on, my Muse, for hark, the Readers say
What, is Dimagoras lost, and shrunk away?
Or has the unmindful Author quite forgot
To bring him on the Stage, why comes he not?
Reader he comes, be pleased to prepare
To see him only come to take the air
After his lovesick passion, which indeed
I shall relate; And thus in short proceed:
The King was pleased (but I know not whether
Pity or policy, or both together
Moved him) to give Dimagoras leave to show
Himself abroad, confining him to go
Guarded without regard; which news being brought
Unto his willing ears, he forthwith thought
Himself in Heaven, for after a restraint
Who would not think that man a happy Saint
That brought him news of liberty: But now
I must implore the Reader to allow
Pardon for an omission, which in brief,
Is this: Dimagoras being filled with grief,
Not knowing, and worse doubting, what would be
The issue of his sad captivity;
But still his thoughts (inclining to despair
More then to comfort) often would prepare
An instrument of death; but still his heart
Proved the worst Actor, of the chiefest part,
And would not let him; but he often would cry
Were It not for fear of dying, I could dye;
Oh life! Oh death! said he, why should there be
Between you two, such an Antipathie?
Alas it is nothing but this trifling breath
That makes such diffrence between life and death;
And what is breath? it is nothing but a blast,
A smoke, a vapor, and it cannot last,
Only in me it riots but to spite
And plague me with the still approaching light,
Or elfe succeeding darkness; thus am I
The subject of cursed Fortunes cruelty:
See now the grim-lookt night is come, and all
The worlds inhabitants provide, and fall
To rest; but I (the watchman of the world)
Am like an abject creature, tossed, and hurld
Into obscurity; but yet I Will try
If sleep will lend a visit to mine eye;
With that he threw himself upon his bed,
Reposes his much discomposed head;
But all in vain, the flatterers of sleep,
(I mean short slumbers) would not let him keep
Decorum in his rest, for now, and then
He starts, now speaks, and then lies still again;
Sometimes his voluntary tongue would cry,
Parthenia, ah Parthenia, why, Oh why
Do thou perplex -- and there a sigh would part
His words, and leave him with a throbing heart:
At last he wakes, and yet I cannot say
He waked, because he slept not, for he lay
Charmed in a dream, which soon shall be expressed;
(He that dreams most, still takes the left of rest.)
At first he dreamed, he saw Parthenia stand
Clothed in white, with Laurel in one hand
And Palm in the other, at whose feet she spread
The Palm, and placed the Laurel, on his head;
At which Dimagoras (much delighted) vented
His joy, in tears, and seemingly lamented
His own unworthiness, whilst she stood by,
And with a pitying smile did seem to dry
His blubbered cheecks; but (as he after swore)
The more she wipt his eyes, he cried the more;
At last she seemed to lay her gentle head
Upon his Pillow, and retire to bed;
With that ('it is quickly judged in what delight
He thought to spend each minute of the night)
He went to welcome her with an embrace,
And found a Spirit snugging in her place:
His warm embraces now are turned to cold
And frosty fears; alas he cannot hold
A joint from trembling, for his gashly eye
Being fixed upon that object which lay by,
Did strive to out stare the Devil; but at length
Fancy retreats, and he receives new strength;
So finding it a Dream, he turns, and then
He falls asleep, and sleeping, dreams again,
And dreaming, thought he saw bold Argalus
Smiling upon him, and salute him thus:
My Lord Dimagoras, I am come to tell
A story, which, I Am sure, will please you well:
The Gods have seen your sufferings, and now
Intend to view you with a serene brow;
As for your wrongs to me, I freely do
Forget them, and in that, I pardon you;
I freely pardon, and Parthenia shall
Be my Engagement, that I pardon all
Your vile abuses, nay, her hand shall sign
Your gracious pardon too, as well as mine;
But I must tell you, though the Gods now please,
After an age of grief to send you ease;
yet if your care contrive not to fulfill
Each particle of their commanding will,
Be well assured that Hell himself near knew
A greater fall, then shall befall to you;
And as for plagues and torments, be assured
You shall find such as cannot be endured;
Thus I advise you; but because the intent
Of this, my speech, is charitably bent
I Will show you more, observe, --
-- With that appears
A manly shape, more grave in looks, then years,
Nor did he come alone, for in his hand
He led a Lady, on whose cheeks did stand
A shower of speaking tears, which seemed to say,
Oh miserable, miserable day:
These are those two, says Angalus, which you
Would willingly betray, but if you do,
Expect the plague of plagues, to vex thy heart,
And re-instate thee in eternal smart;
Observe, and weigh my words, and let not fear
Bribe thee to so much baseness, have a care;
And when you see them, seem to see them not,
So shall you purchase a most happy lot;
But one thing more: Before I dis-appear,
I needs must recommend unto your ear
A serious truth, which will be ere this night,
Chased by the approaching morning, takes its flight;
'Twill fo fall out, that your distracted head
Will sall much lower then your lofty bed;
You shall receive a fall, which fall, indeed
Shall cause your heart, as well as head, to bleed;
But at which time, a Damosel shall present
Her self unto you with a good intent
To salve your several hurts, her virgin name
Shall be Lutosa, whose renowned fame
Shall echo through the world; her virtues shall
Precede her Beauty, and her beauty, all:
The wings of fame shall mount her to the skies,
She Is fair, she is rich; and what is best, she is wise;
She Is wise, because she is humble, and she is fair,
Because she is wise, she is rich, because she is heir
Unto Apollo, Venus, Craesus; Nay,
She Is more then second to Parthenia:
This Lady, whose perfections far transcend
Perfection, shall be proud to recommend
Her dear affections to your constant breast,
And so farewell: The event shall speak the rest,
And there he vanished --
-- Now Dimagoras dreams
Of Cupid, Venus, and of all the extremes
Of Love; his over-busie thoughts are now
In consultation, sweetly ploting how
To Pen an amorous Letter; first he writes,
And then blots out, and afterward, indites;
And now his trembling hand begins to hold
The Paper, where loves stories must be told;
He sighs, and then begins; My dearest Dear,
May these my rude unpolished Lines, -- and here
He stops, dislikes, then likes, dislikes again*
Throws by that Paper; then another strain
Must be constrained, and now his matter flows;
He smites his breast, looks up, and to it he goes:
The Letter's finished, now it must be read;
Hark how he sighs, see how he shakes his head,
He reads, and cries, the matter is not good,
The manner's naught, and 'twill be understood
More Complement, then love; yet he is bent
To send it; What is love but Complement?
And now it is sealed, sealed with a bleeding heart
Transfixt, and wounded with an amorous dart:
Away it is sent; Oh how his spirits burn
In expectation of a quick return:
The almost breathless Messenger is now
Returned again, who with a sweating brow
Presents a Letter, which with trembling speed
He took, and kissed; and then began to read;
He reads, then studies, reads again, and then
Cries out, Oh cruel women, wretched men;
These women-Sophisters can make that sense
That Is Present, be the Preterfect-tense,
These she Grammarians often times displace,
And put the Verb before the Nom'native Case;
There Rhetoric kisses and their Logic looks,
Would make an Aristotl burn his Books;
Their smiles are Tropes, and figures, and their words
Are dark Enigma's, every look affords
Large Volumns of discourse; their tears, they are
Who can tell what, my Genious, stop thou there;
Women, like Globes, do always love to be
In motion, still confined to liberty;
In this they differ, That no art can find
The perfect Centure of a woman's mind:
But stay, me thinks this Letter does express
More then an ordinary dubiousness;
Her tongue must be the interpreter, for I
Am unacquainted in loves mystery;
I Will haste unto her, for this cannot be
Her proper Language, no, I know that she
Is more ingenious, yet a woman's heart
Is always wavering, -- There a sudden start
Gave motion to his Limb, yet sleep at length
Did captivate his brain, and gave new strength
Unto his fancy, then his fancy brought
Him to his Lady: Now each forward thought
Corrects the former; so that he could find.
No means t'express the affections of his mind;
Now sighs, and steadfast looks must only prove,
The sad, and powerful Orators of love;
They counter-look each other, for her eye
Still thwarted his, and yet she knew not why;
She blushed because he looked* and he again
Would look, because she blushed, but all in vain,
For on a sudden (starting from his dream)
He wakes, and waking cries, Oh how extreme
Unquiet, are my slumbers, yet I find
The more I slumber, I am more confined
To slumber; but I hope the welcome day
Will come, and chase these falcities away:
Till then, -- and there a slumber did surprise
The yiedling Fort of his besieged eyes;
He had not long engaged himself to sleep
Before an other vision seemed to creep
Into his fancy, which rejoiced his breast
And brought more comfort to him then the rest:
He dreamed he saw Parthenia, in whose face
He read the pleasing Charracters of grace,
He looked upon her, and her Commet-eye
Portended liberal pardon; by and by
(Approaching nearer) she began to break
Her lips; he seemed to hear, and she to speak
To this effect: Know then, that I am come
To tell you that your time of Martyrdom
Is near at hand, nay start not, for I mean
No harm; I Will be an Actor in this Scene:
Mistake me not, you are not like to prove
A Martyr, only in the flames of love;
Be careful, that no envious fate incline
To cross your love, as once it did do mine:
Remember who it was, that to fulfill
The cruel pleasure of his greedy will
Surpised me when my busy thoughts were crowned
With Argalus; Who dragged me on the ground?
Reviled, and kicked me? nay, and what is worse
Poisoned my face, and made my life a curse:
This was the cause which made me to deny
My Argalus, and say, It is not I;
And yet I loved him, but my love was such
I waved it, why? Because I loved him much:
Ah was it fit that Argalus should be
Matched to so much extreme deformity;
Yet in what lovesick terms would he express
How much he loved deformed happiness;
How did he curse the daylight for revealing
So foul a face, the darkness for concealing
The treasure of his heart; Thus night nor day
Could please him, when his dear Parthenia
Denied her Argalus; ah can there be
In man, so unbeliev'd a constancy;
Nor was this all, for when, nor word, nor vow;
Could tempt my stubborn heart once to allow
A grant to his desires, away I stole,
Unknown to any, left him to condole
My unknown absence, for 'twas my intent
To lose my self; I knew not where I went,
Nor what I did; that passion of the mind,
Which make us dumb, as well can make us blind;
But see the will of fortune, I that strayed
I knew not how, nor where, nay never made
The least enquiry, was by well-pleased Fate
Brought to my Aunts, (the Queen of Corinths) Gate,
Where being come, my near relations, made
(After they knew) me welcome, where I stayed
Till time had wrought my cure, which being done
My well composed thoughts began to run
Upon my Argalus, the more each part
Was cured, the more I found, a wounded heart;
At last I sent to see if I could find
(There is no sickness to a lovesick mind)
My Love; but when the Messenger returned
I froze with fear to ask, and yet I burned
With a desire to know; and w^^ (...) blame
Long smothered Love, to break into a flame;
But Fate (which then was courtious) brought about
My wishes, for at last, I found him out:
Nor was I then content; my zealous mind
Began to plot, and try if I could find
A flaw in his affections, but I found
His heart as constant, and his love as sound
As heart could wish; it is true, I laid this plot
To see if Argalus had quite forgot
His Dear Parthenia; but I could espy
(And read within the volumn of his eye)
The affections of his heart; but he at first
Took me for what I was, yet after burst
Into a storm of tears, because his eye
Cheated his thoughts, I told him it was not I;
But that I came t'invite him now to take
A heart on trust, for dead Parthenias sake:
But he refused; yet the more I made
My strong attempt, and resolutely said;
My Lord, you must accept; He shook his head,
And cried, Oh Heavens! and is Parthenia dead?
If she be dead, what heart have I to give?
And how can I receive* that cannot live
To make requital, Earth shall sooner move
Then I will yield unto a second love,
Although I must confess, says he, you are
Parthenia's Image, and might be her heir
In worth, and beauty; but alas, she is fled,
And I am flying; Is Parthenia dead,
Oh then -- with that I flew into his arms,
And so restored him with my woeful charms,
Nay it was long before I could persuade
His heart to credit what my tongue had said;
Yet at the last, loves circumstances proved
That I was once his lost, yet well-belov'd
And true Parthenia; thus by lucky art
My face was cured before, and then, my heart:
Thus after all this turbulent confusion
Fate brought our wishes to a good conclusion,
And you to punishment, which seemed to glory,
In being Author of this Tragic story;
But I forgive you, wishing you to be
A Philalethes, not a falisie:
And now because that you may fully know
That you are pardoned, follow where I go;
Be confident of what I say, and tell
The enquiring world, what has this might befell;
So follow me: Impatient of delay
He rises in his sleep, and hasts away;
And being up, he ransacks all about
To see if he could find Parthenia out;
But she was gone, and yet he blindly gropes
About the Room, being filled with fruitless hopes
At last to find her; but his sleepy pace
Brings him with speed unto the fatal place
Of execution; down the stairs he falls,
And falling wakes, and waking, swears, and bawls
For Justice on Parthenia, whilst he cries,
Revenge, revenge, my swelling injuries
Upon that cursed Hagg; Oh let her be
Confined to Hell for perpetuity;
Oh where am I, cries he, can any tell
Except the Devil; Am I not in Hell;
Or do I dream; yet Dreams do seldom show
Reality; I Am bruised and battered, -- Oh --
My head, my shoulders, nay, and every part
Does now contrive to breed an aching heart;
What Devil tossed me hither, must I be
The Tennis-ball of Hell? Oh tyranny;
What, have they drencht me in the Stigian Lake?
For I am wet, my head, my shoulders ache;
What streams are these, that run, and flow about
My face, and ears* what are my brains beat out?
Oh help, for pity help,; what shall I lie
Brainless, and helpless, and unpitied dye;
What is the world grown deaf? or do I call
Without regard? Oh most accursed fall;
I cannot help my self, it is therefore vain
For me to strive to crawl up stairs again;
Well then, since none will pity, farewell breath,
I Will be content to groan my self to death:
Thus lay Dimagoras, groaning forth a curse,
His cries were terrible, his groans were worse.
The trembling Jailer heard his groans, his cries;
But had as little power to pray, as rise;
He is all fear, no hopes can reconcile
His thoughts to Heaven, his actions are so vile;
He called his sins before him with intent
To add unto them, but not to repent;
Goalers are Hells pawn-brokers, for they take
Forty, per Cent* and do it for pity sake;
Sometimes they will carry (with a dexterous art)
Heaven in their face, the Devil in their heart;
And it is well known, the oppressed prisoners cry,
Is their delight; their groans, their melody:
Reader, consider but a Jailer well,
You Will find him Devil, and his prison, Hell:
But whither run I: must Dimagoras lie
Pickled in blood without a remedy:
The day appears, the Jailer now begins
To stare about him, and forget his sins,
He now starts up; His Wife being grave and wise,
Bids him confess his faith before he rise;
Faith (says the Jailer) what should that thing be?
If I keep faith, in troth 'twill not keep me:
Tell me of faith, Hell bury thee alive;
It Is sweet oppression makes a Jailer thrive:
She speaks again; why, Minion, what do ayle
Says he; Faith will not silver-lace thy tail,
Nor feed your wants: No more; for if you do,
Your Faith shall be your meat, and clothing too;
The name of that bare word will make me fail,
'Twill prove a poison, and break open my Goal;
It Is much like Mercury, because 'twill eat
Through Iron bars, nay, it is a thing will cheat,
The Devil, nay, I tell thee without doubt,
If we keep that, 'twill let our prisoners out;
I fear, I fear, this very word portends
Some mischief unto us, or to our friends:
My dreams were sad this night, me thoughts the great
Lyconian Lord was grown so spruce, and neat,
That all the world admired him, nay, his brain
(Untuned by frenzy) was now tuned again,
And at the last me thonghts I saw him lie
Upon a Couch, and our Lutosa by,
Braiding his hair; he gently seemed to play
And toy wirh her,, but in a civil way;
At last me thoughts I heard a noise, that made
My trembling-unprovided heart afraid;
I started from my sleep, made haste, and went
To rise, but that thy Language did prevent,
And hinder my defign; I thank my Fate
I never heard a word did more abate
My courage, for, indeed, I was inclined
To rise, and run to quarrel with the wind;
But such another word (I Will tell thee true)
Would make me use a prisoner like a Jew:
But now I Will rise, but prithee speak no more,
Nor name that word which once you named before;
But now I think on it, I must haste and go
Unto my Lord Dimagoras, and know
What he intends; the King has gave him leave
To take the air; but yet I can perceive
No great desire he has to leave this place;
My Paradise sure pleases well his grace;
But e're he stirs, I will be sure that he
(Were he my flesh and blood) shall pay his Fee;
I Will have and see what his wise Lordship says,
Good morrow Wife; Pray not a word of faith:
Away he goes; no sooner was he come
Within the door of the scarce-twilight room,
But he espies confusion; for the Bed
Was thrown quite open, and Dimagoras fled:
The Jailer, much affrighted, hasts away
Unto his Wife, and thus began to say;
I am undone, cries he, undone, Good Wife
Be civil to me, quickly take a knife
And cut my throat, Dimagoras is fled,
I shall be hanged, Oh that I now were dead;
Prithee dispatch me, for 'twill be disgrace
To see thy husband hanged before thy face;
Call up my servants quickly, whilst I stay
And see if I can force my self to pray;
Good Wife make haste, be quick; away she flies,
And runs down stairs with lightning in her eyes;
She calls her servants, but they could not hear,
For sleep had barrocado'd every ear;
At last, away she runs, thinking to call
Her Daughter; but she stumbling, caught a fall;
They say that women stumble at a straw;
But this I Am sure was none, because she saw
It was Dimagoras, who begun to cry
Torment me not Parthenia, let me dye,
I am half dead, Oh do me not the wrong
To hinder me, I'have lived too too long
Too long: with that up gets the Goalers wife,
Runs to her husband, husband safe thy life,
Dimagoras, Dimagoras -- and there
She wanting breath, was forced to gape for air;
With that the Jailer, for a little space
Stood still, and she stood staring in his face;
They both were mute; the Jailer thought it vain
To speak to her that could not speak again;
But looking strictly on her, he espies
Her hands, her cloths all bloody, then he cries
Out murder, murder: and by this time, all
The house was up, who hearing him to call,
And cry out murder, came all armed to see
What was the matter; but by this time, she
Had taken breath, and told her husband, that
Dimagoras was not fled, but to say what
The matter was, she knew not; but her haste
Made her to trip, and tumble cross his wast.
The Jailer now looks big, begins to swear
By Hercules, that all things were not fair;
He snatched his sword into his hand, and run
Down stairs, to see the things that had been done,
Where being come (attended with his Guard)
He looked about, but could not see, yet heard
Sad groans, as could by horror be expressed;
(But to find pity in a Goalers breast
Is more then miracle) he hunts about,
Yet could not find (what he expected) out;
He calls his Wife, and says, it is strange that she
Should stumble at a thing, he could not see.
Prepostrous fool, says she, suppose that men,
Should know how often their wives did fall; what then?
By this I see your zealesie appears,
Your horns, good man, are longer then your ears,
Says she; Come follow me, I Will show you where
Your Prisoner lies, lift up your horns, look there,
Look well upon him, judge him if you can
To be a knowing able woman's man;
The Jailer now provides him, to debate
The cause, and reason, of his low estate;
Goes nearer to him, wills him to express
The dismal cause of this unhappiness;
But all in vain, Dimagoras, whose eyes
Were glew'd with blood, could not behold his wise*
And careful Jailer, neither did he find,
Whose voice it was* being, deaf, as well as blind;
With that the Jailer seeing 'twas in vain
To question him, whose fear, more then his pain,
Made him elingued, gave command that he
Should be committed to his bed, and be
Observed with care, whilst he himself, would run
And fetch a Surgeon, which thing being done,
He brings him in, who presently provides
To patch his head, and plaster up his sides;
He washed his head, then takes his Probe, and tries
The deepness of his wounds; Dimagoras cries,
What you mean, ye Hell Hounds, are ye come
To bring me to a second martyrdom;
Torment me not, it is known that I have store
Of plagues already, then what need I more?
Oh that my eyes were open, that I might
But see the day, how blessed a thing is light?
Say, are ye men, or Devils? by and by,
Replied the Surgeon, your observing eye
Shall testify the truth, so by degrees
Unglews his eyelids, and Dimagoras sees,
And knows them all; he being gently dressed,
Tells his misfortune, and so goes to rest;
After some hours of sleep, Dimagoras wakes,
Finding himself at ease, he gently shakes
His slumbers off; and then begins to call
To mind the fate of his unlucky f^ll;
He well remembered that he dreamed he should
Receive a sudden fall, a fall that would
Prove prejudicial, which he found too true;
But mist the Damosel promised to ensue,
And dress his wounds; nay, and he calls to mind
Her name, and cries Lutosa was unkind
Not to appear; but yet he hoped his fate,
Would yet prove kind, it being not too late:
His longing soul now groans, and sighs to see
Some good, after so much of misery;
Alas, says he, has providence forgot
To send thee hither, ah why come thou not
In spite of Fate? be certain I will prove
A constant lover' never to remove
My well-fix't thoughts: Love has a secret art,
I am already wedded in my heart;
I hugg thee in my soul; Oh do not stay
My dear Lutosa, come, Oh come away;
My thoughts, are by thy absence, much increast;
And thus I take up love at interest;
Save these extreme expenses, and command
That I may take it at a better hand;
Oh come: Having so said (half void of hope)
The door being softly moved, did gently open;
In comes a thing, whose worth is best expressed
By saying nothing, Reader, judge the rest;
And yet because truth may be clearly shown,
It was the Goalers daughter, who was known,
And called Lutosa,; this is she, whose beauty,
As it commanded, so it proffered, duty
Unto Dimagoras; Reader, would thou hear
Her Character; be patient, and give ear:
'First, she was natures oversight, and then
'Her fathers darling, and a scorn to men:
'Her mother often would say, she was begot,
'When peevish nature did, she knew not what;
And this is she, ( Dimag'ras dreamed) was fair,
Was rich, was wise, nay, and Apollo's heir;
But let me whisper, and I Will tell thee what,
Believe quite contrary, and she was that:
It Is more then double misery to dwell
Upon a name, whose Character, is Hell;
She was a Goalers daughter; what need more?
The consequence denotes her to be -- W --
Yet good enough for him, whose lep'rous name
Deserves no other Wife, then lasting shame;
She stares upon Dimagoras, who now
Begins to view her with a wrinkled brow;
His faith depending on his flattering dream,
Makes him believe that she is all extreme;
His lovesick thoughts are plotting how to praise
And court her beauty, in an amorous phrase;
He calls her to him, she (not being coy)
Stradles unto him, and begins to toy
And wanton with his hair, entreats, desires,
To dress his wounds, and with much zeal, requires
The reason of his raging grief; whilst he
Is ravished with her affability;
His trembling hand seizes her dirty paw,
Her daring Nose still keeps her mouth in awe,
Or else she bad, (more to complete his bliss)
Crowned his pale lips, with a be-slabbering kiss;
He sighs, and she, as willing to requite
His pains, endeavors with much speed and might
To answer him, but counld not, for she knew
Not how to sigh, but gave a grunt, or two,
Which (to speak truth) did very much content
Dimagoras, who thought that she had rent,
Her heart in pieces; after that, she throws
Her goggle-eyes about, and then bestows
A wide-mouthed smile upon him, which expressed
Ten thousand joys, he thinks himself as blessed
As bliss can make him, and begins to take
Courageous boldness, passionate to make
Humble addresses to her; She begins
TO admire her self, he courts her and she grins,
Grows now a little coy; and will not stay,
But by compulsion; strives to go away,
Because she knows she cannot; Oh what pains
He takes to hold her, whilst she strives and strains
TO unscrew her self; why, let me go, says she,
Or I will tell your incivilitie
Unto my father, who will make you know
What it is to use his virgin Daughter so;
I will be gone, with that Dimagoras vents
A shower of tears, and shows his discontents,
By his too steadfast looks, which made her show
An angry brow, although it were not so:
It Is importunity makes women prove
Insulting tyrants over proffered love:
Dimagoras sues, and begs, whilst she replies,
Away with these your false, fond flateries;
My mother told me, that I must not yield
At first; and they are Cowards quit the field
At the first onset; nay, my mother told me,
Men do not always love me, when they hold me;
She charged me too, when men desired to know
Whether I could affect; at first, say no:
And here she whispered, Oh unhappy I,
It goes against my stomach to deny;
And though I dare not in a present sense
Yet I may love you in the Future Tense;
Then let me go, you shall not be withstood
If you will but keep in the Optative Mood:
Away she trundles, whilst his nimble eye
Pursues her to the last discovery.
The door being shut, and his Lutosa fled,
He then composed his distracted head;
Begins to ruminate, and call to mind
Her several graces, and with what a kind
Aspect she looked upon him, then to say
She had no crime, but that she went away;
But Oh ye powers, cries he, do but befriend
My wishes with success, and quickly send
My soul unto me, for alas I own
Nothing of life, when my Lutosa's gone:
I am a Statue, nay, and what is worse,
Her present absence makes my life a curse;
Ah, where art thou my dearest, do not stay
Too long but come* Oh quickly come away,
Here, here, thy languishing Dimagoras lies
Wounded, with what must cure, thy balmy eyes;
Let thy disquiet heart permit no rest
To crowd into thy heart, till thou have blessed
Thy dearest with a visit: Could thou see
My heart, my dear, Oh thou would pity me.
The door (which seemed to pity) by degrees
Was opened, but alas Dimagoras sees,
Not what he looked for, for it proved to be
The Jailer, and Surgeon, come to see,
And dress his wounds, so after he had done
Departs; And then the Jailer thus begun.
My Lord, I thought it fit to let you know
If you desire to take the air, and go
A mile or two; I shall this afternoon
Be ready to attend you, and as soon
As with convenience your Lordship shall
Give me command, I will attend your call;
To which Dimagoras (after thanks) replied,
Your civil kindness shall not be denied;
Therefore this afternoon, I shall prepare
My self, and willingly enjoy the air;
But being (you know a stranger) must depend
Upon your interest, for I have no friend
To welcome me; Thus having understood
What I intend; do what you shall think good:
To which the Jailer thus replied, My Lord,
Arcadia it a Country does afford
Both courtesy and plenty, it is well known,
That civil entertainmet's always shown,
Especially to strangers; never doubt,
My Lord, we will find good entertainment out:
There is a Knight, not two Leagues from this place
(Whose hospitable goodness gives a grace,
And life to fame) whose seat, is truly, called
The Palace of delight, being fenced, and walled
About with Marble; Art and Nature, were
A long time plotting how to make it rare;
And many curious eyes, have often went
To see, and judge, which was most excellent,
Nature, or Art; but none could justly tell,
Because they both endeavored to excel:
Unto this place, my Lord, if you think fit,
We Will steer our course, but let us not omit
Our oppertunity, my Lord, time flies
Without reclaim, convenience bids rise,
Whilst I, my Lord, will hasten to prepare
Accomodations, this shall be my care.
Away the Jailer went, who being gone,
Dimagoras began to think upon
His dear Lutosa, nothing could proclaim
Him happy, but this crooked piece of shame;
But time draws on, Dimagoras now prepares
To take his Journey, loaded with more cares
Then ever; Now he labors to pretend
An indispose, as hoping to befriend
Himself with an advantage how to speak
With his Lutosa, or his heart must break;
But see how all things seemingly concur
To make complete his happiness in her;
For in she comes, I will not now express
Her comely carriage, or her dirty dress;
Her graceful dopps, no, nor her sheep-like eyes,
It is enough, Dimagoras discries
Nothing but beauty joined with equal parts,
Sufficient to subdue the stontest hearts;
He strokes his Beard, and with a well-pleased look
He stepped unto her, chring'd, and after took
Her by the hand; judge then what follows next,
Not much of consequence from such a Text:
He looked as if his hopeless heart were breaking,
Nor could he speak for sighs, she sigh, for speaking
But at the last, perpending well, how short
The time would be, he treated in this sort:
My dear Lutosa, wonder not, I know
Thy name, for fancy told me it was so;
Moreover, I was warned in a dream
TO adore that beauty which I found extreme:
Then blame me not (because in thee I find
My dream fulfilled) to proffer thee my kind,
And true affections, for by all that is good
I love thee equal with my dearest blood;
The world shall not exclude thee from my arms,
I will defend, and guard thee from all harms;
Oh that I were in Arms, that I might try;
For love gives courage, courage victory:
I Will plough the Ocean, rip up Mountains, make
The knit brow'd-surly-cragged Rocks to quake
At my appearance; nay, if Hell shall dare
To contradict me, he shall feel a share
Of my imposed revenge, there is nothing can
Withstand the attempts of a resolved man;
I am resolved, let all the world conspire
Against me, I will crown my blessed desire
With good effect; If my Lutosa say
It shall be done, it is done, who dare gainsay?
If any dare oppose, let him be shown
To me in Arms; I Will warrant thee mine own:
If Mars should come in person, and propound
But love to thee. I Would make him kiss the ground:
What were Knight Errants, only arrant knaves,
And base Impostors, nay, the very slaves
Of time, and fortune, prating thus, and thus;
And such an other thing was Argalus,
Compared to me; I Am confident that fate
Dares not to make me less then fortunate:
Suppose (my dear affected) thou were now
Enclosed with Bulls, and Bears, dispairing how
To save thy life, and I by chance come by,
And view my Dearest in such misery;
Oh how I Would make those Tyrants fly, and run
Like subject mists before the Princely Sun:
What says my Love, will thou accept a heart
Unconquerable, but by thee, who art
Commandress of my soul; will thou incline
To my request, and tell me thou art mine?
Forget that female custom, do not say
The child of Love, cannot be in one day
Begot, nay bred, and born; for it must be
Encreast, brought forth, by times maturitie;
Believe not these fond falseties, for know
Love is an active, sprightly thing, will grow
Insensible; it is more then petty treason
Against the God of Love, to love by reason:
What reason was there, that there should be seen
So much entire affection between
Vulcan and Venus; Cupids Arrows fly
Not always constant, sometimes low, then high;
For I have known, a Noble Lord, express
Affection to an humble Shepherdess;
How many highborn Kings did often prove
Sad Martyrs* in the common flames of love;
But this (I must confess) discretion must
Not attribute to Love, so much as Lust;
There may be Love, in Lust, but it is wall known
To be a spurious, and a bastard one;
Such Love, like Mother-pearl, does often send forth
A glorious luster, but is little worth:
Or like that foolish fire, which men say
Only mis guids, and leads men from their way,
And then it leaves them* like a sudden blast,
Whose fierce extremes portend it cannot last;
This is a mock-love, only fit to be
The subject of our hatred; thus you see,
My (Dear Lutosa) and may well infer
From hence, that perfect Love can never err;
For notwithstanding love may like the fire,
Whose rapid flames, do often times aspire;
And sometimes wanting fuel to maintain
It Is strength, does seemingly go out again;
Yet, without doubt, the fire is still the same,
The cause being gone, the effect must needs be lame;
Love is the ground of Love, a thing divine,
And truly Noble, such a Love is mine;
My dear Lutosa come, let me infold,
And lock thee in mine Arms, er'e time grows old.
Let not the prime of Love be spent in toys,
At my return I will complete my joys
By sacred Matrimony; speak, my Dear,
And let a speedy, free consent appear,
Though ushered with a blush; it is always known
The Rose does never blush until it is blown;
Reply (my Dearest) time cannot allow
A fitter oppo^tunity then now;
Will thou complete the blessings of my life,
And crown me with the comforts of a Wife;
Speak, speak my Joy, or let thy silence be
The proclamation of our unity;
I must be gone: She stares upon his face,
As if her looks would speak, and for a space
She held him by the hand, with an intent
To speak, but that the Jailer did prevent
Her resolutions; so being heavy hearted,
He sighs, she grunts, he sighs again, and parted:
Away he went, scarce knowing what he did,
And love sick passions are not easily hid:
At last when he had made a near approach,
He spies a Guard stand round about his Coach,
Which unexpected object made him vent
In whispers, his unruly discontent;
He calls the Jailer to him, makes his ear
The privy-Chamber of his new-bred fear;
His fear was so extreme, that every part,
Declared in trembles, his afflicted heart:
The Jailer wonders at this sudden change,
Speaking but softly, said, my Lord, it is strange
To see what alteration's newly bred;
You that but now advanced your stately head
As high as Heaven, do now abuse your birth
Make honor blush, to see you court the earth
With your depending crest; my Lord, advance
Your drooping soul, fear not, nor fate, nor chance
Shall do you wrong, this Guard is to attend,
And wait upon your Honor, to defend
Your noble Person; well, if good success
Proves this a truth, says he, that you express,
Be well assured, that thou shall ever find
A grateful friend; but prithee prove so kind
To tell me truly, is it not intended
That I shall dye, because I am befriended
With such a Guard, I fear it is too too true
But you are loath to tell me, prithee do:
Let these few Angels tutor thee to speak
The speedy truth, or else my heart will break:
With that the Jailer, (Oh the effect of gold,
What Town? What Garrison is that can hold
Against such Batteries?) suddenly replied:
May all the plagues of Hell, my Lord, betide
And fall upon me, may they be encreast
To more then infinite, if in the least
Your death's intended; now, my Lord, be free
In your belief, enjoy your liberty;
As for the Guard, assure your self they are
To wait in honor, till you take the air:
And so my Lord, be pleased to possess
Your Coach, and you shall see their readiness*
To do you honor; so away they went,
Dimagoras being mod'rately content,
Until he came into the Street and spied
Such throngs of people, and how he was eyed
By every one, who looked, but on this score
As he supposed, never to see him more;
Nay that which more confirmed him, was, his ear
(Which then was much attentive) seemed to hear
Some curse and say* Now may the hangman take
And truss the villain for Parthenia's sake:
These words were bitter Corasives; now he
Curses the Goalers infidelity;
He thinks to quit the Coach, but then his thoughts
Presents before him his unequal faults;
Resolves to stay, because he thinks the Rout
Would have no mercy till his Brains were out:
At last seeing himself begin to appear
Without the City, he begins to cheer,
And stroke his Beard, his peaceful heart does now
Begin to sit in triumph on his brow:
'Fear is the senses whirlewind, for it blows
'The minds chief faculties away, and throws
'The reason out of order, judgment must
'Be whirled in to the lofty air, like dust:
Dimagoras can witness this conclusion*
'Folly and fear are parents of confusion:
'And he whose fear exceeds his reason, borrows
'A fair advantage to increase his sorrows;
But now Dimagoras his stormy mind
Grows calm, and quiet; now he is inclined
TO observe the Countries pleasure, which indeed
Does justly claim the privilege to exceed:
She Is natures eldest Daughter, wears the Crown
Of pleasure, plenty, jewel'd with Renown;
And to speak truth, she truly can invite
The strictest eye, to banquet with delight;
But in respect she has been praised before
By better Pens then mine, I Will say no more:
Thus having brought Dimagoras, though with fear
Yet with much safety, out of Town, l'le steer
My course toward his Lutosa, who is now
In labor with her thoughts, complotting how
With most advantage, to declare her mind
Unto her Mother; Fortune proving kind
Just at that instant, brought her Mother in,
Which gave Lutosa courage to begin,
And thus proceed: -- Mother, says she, I must
Commit a secret, to your care, and trust,
Which is as follows: --
-- Our Lyconian Lord
Of late has pleased in passion to afford
Large promises of Love; but Mother, know
Because you bid me, I still answered, No;
But still the more that I denied, the more
He importuned me, and would not give over
His strong requests, swearing by all the powers
Above, before the expense of many hours,
He would; though with the hazard of his life,
Finish his joys, by making me his wife;
Oh how he vowed; And there, with much ado,
She wrings, and squeezes out, a tear or two;
And then she cries, Mother I must confess
I love the man more then I can express:
Oh Mother! how his circling Arms did twine
About my waste, he called me his Divine
And Dear Lutosa, holding fast my hand,
And staring in my face, whilst there did stand
A Pearly shower within his pretty eyes,
As Arguments of his extreamities;
Oh how he wrong my hands, and would not let
Me go, but like an Owl caught in a Net
I fluttered up, and down, but all in vain
The more I strove, the more he would constrain,
And keep me, swearing that he cared not whither
His life, or I went first, or both together;
So dearly does he love me, and I Am sure
His steadfast love will constantly endure,
It will, it will; Oh how my Spirits burn,
I am inflamed, I long for his return;
Mother, 'twil add unto your aged life
A score of years, to see your daughter, wife
Unto a Noble Lord: Ah Daughter, Daughter,
Replied the Mother, mind what follows after;
It Is no such happiness to be his Spouse
That makes (with an intent to break) his vows
Besides, what joy, what pleasure can there be
In this his love's extreme extremity.
Extremes, like bubles, swell, but cannot last,
Nor claim more durance then a sudden blast;
Suppose you were invited as a Guest
To some rich Banquet, or a Marriage Feast,
Tell me, nay quickly tell me, would you eat
By well-cram'd handfulls, such delitious meat,
Or by degrees? Reason, and Nature are
For moderate uses; they that eat to spare,
Spare often to eat; Thus consequence may prove
There is no surfeit like a whole (...);
Moreover, do you think that (...) art
Can make it good to my experienced heart,
That he, vile man, (that never yet was true
To any) will be constant unto you;
Believe it not; but yet, for ought I know,
He being mad, perhaps has made you so;
Only in this, the match is very fit,
Because you truly equal him in wit;
Moreover, call to mind how he abused
Divine Parthenia, nay, and basely used
Our most Renowned Celania, whom I wish
The Gods defend and guard from prejudice:
He is a Traitor to the Laws of Reason,
Begot by murder, and brought forth by treason:
And do you think that he which was content
To'abuse those Beauties which were excellent
Can dote on you, that only have a beauty
Can boast equivolency to your duty.
Which (to speak truth) is nothing; you inherit
Your Fathers baseness, with as base a spirit:
Nature did crowd into the world a curse
When thou were born, and could not make thee worse;
But now you fondly hope to change your life;
You Will be a Lords, and I a Goalers wife;
Your cruel Father, doubtless will be proud
To hear this news, pray tell it him aloud;
With that away she flung, clapps to the door,
Being tired with what she heard, would hear no more,
Where now I Will leave them, for I am to make
What haste, what speed I can, to overtake
Dimagoras in his Journey; but a while
I Will rest, not turn a pleasure to a toil.
The end of the Third Book.
THE Fourth Book.
FLY gentle Pegasus, it now must cost
Us labor, to redeem the time that is lost,
Dimagoras has gone much ground* whilst we
Loyt'ring behind, have lost the liberty
Of hearing his discourse, which, without doubt
Was pleasing; Come let us have to find him out.
My Muse has overtaken him, and now
He Is very busy in observing how
The Country lay, whilst his observing eye
Upon a hills assent, did soon discry
A Stately Palace, which indeed gave more
Content, then all that he had seen before;
It was Kalanders Palace, who indeed
(As 'twas impossible he should exceed
His Fathers virtues) equally expressed
As much of bounty, with a noble breast:
Dimagoras (much contented) makes a stand,
First views the house, and then surveys the Land;
Observes each herd of Cattle, how they browse
And inter-weave themselves amongst the boughs;
Then his obliquor eyes (with living cheer
Banquet themselves) observes the well-fed Deer
Crusted within a wall, that would invite
Mere gluttony unto an appetite:
Then with a more, then half reverted eye
(Being greedy in his looks) he did espy
Hugh flocks of well-fleec'd sheep, whose frisking Lambs
Would (in obedience to their blating Dams,
And their own hunger) often kneel down, and tugg
The swelling bounty of the exuberous dugg;
Nor did his eye alone Monopolize
These several pleasures; for his ears, likewise
Were courted with delight; in this they got
The upper hand, the eyes could see them not;
Yet by the ears direction they could see
The happy Authors of this melody:
It was four Damsels, sitting on the ground
Cussion'd with Hillocks, laboring to confound
Their sorrows in a Ditty; having took
There several seats near to a neighboring Brook,
Whose silver streams, being proud to overflow
Their virdent banks, stood still, as't twere, to show
An admiration, seeming to express
An humble duty to each Shepherdess;
At last (having not Neptunes grant to stay)
They shrunk within their bounds, and danced away:
Dimagoras (though well-pleased) was not content
To hear at distance, craved the free consent
Of his attentive Jailer, to go near
Unto the place, and undiscovered hear
Their Amarous Songs; The Jailer gave consent,
They quit the Coach, and so away they went;
But er'e they could arrive unto the end
Of their desires they were enforced to lend
Their ears to new delights, a voice was sent
Into their souls, to cause a ravishment;
They both amazed, thought, they knew not what
Both wondering what it was they wondered at;
They now employ their eyes to pry about
To see if they could find this Angel out;
At last their heedless paces brought them nigh
Unto a Jes'mine Grove, being thick and high;
Yet was it not so thick, but that the ear
strictly attending, could prevail to hear,
And understand these words, which in regard
They pleased him not, Dimagoras wished unheard.
Feighn would I love, but dare not trust
Because I know the hearts of Men
Glory often times to be unjust,
Therefore I Will love I know not when.
Happy and blessed is she that can
Live without this thing called Man.
Were I like fair Parthenia,
And had an Argalus to woe me,
Experience bids me sadly say
A vile Dimagoras might undo me.
Happy and blessed is she that can
Live without this thing called Man.
I will not love, nor will I hate,
But constant to my vows I Will prove,
I Will be contented in this State,
When men prove just I Will learn to love.
Happy and blessed is she that can
Live without this thing called Man.
Then farewell all those flattering toys
Which some esteem the gr^atest pleasure,
They are but outside painted joys,
Virginity's the best of treasure.
How truly blessed is she that can
Live without this thing called Man.
And here Dimagoras, though he did not care
TO applaud the matter, yet he liked the air;
But his disturbed thoughts were all this while
Boiling with rage to hear himself called vile:
And now he (like a blood-hound) sents about
To see if he can find this party out.
Who sent this pleasing, most displeasing Song
Into his ears; he had not hunted long
Before was represented to his sight
(Which indeed pleased him not) an armed Knight
Who with undaunted courage thus expressed
Himself* What are ye Friends that have transgrest
Our strict-kept Laws; go back, look up, and see
That fair Inscription, read your destiny;
With that Dimagoras lifting up his head,
Observes the Iuscription, stares upon it, and read
To this effect.
Let none presume to pass this way,
But such as do intend to stay,
And give Encounter to a Knight
Who will forthwith come in sight;
Let him that overcomes remain
Till he be overcome again,
Or else if he in several fights
Can conquer two and fifty Knights
He may, at that self same hour
Release Corinda from this Bower;
And to period all his strife,
He is to take her for his Wife;
She is a Princess, whose Renown
Justly deserves to wear the Crown.
Dimagoras having read this dismal story,
Not greatly thirsting after short lived glory,
Looks pale and wan; The Jailer thinks of flying,
Trembles, and almost dies, for fear of dying:
The impatient Knight forthwith imploys his Page
To fetch Accoutrements, whilst with a sage
And well-composed countenance he told
Dimagoras, that good fortune made him bold
In these attempts; for he had often shown
Himself a Conqueror, and over-thrown
Forty six Knights already, and before
We part, says he, I hope to want but four,
As now I do but six, for by that fate
That sent you hither, I Will expire the date
Of both your lives; the world has truly known
Amphialus was never overthrown,
Nor ever was my courage fully tried,
Or matched, except by Argalus, that died
By my unequalled Sword: These thundering words
(Though modestly expressed) proved two edged swords
Unto Dimagoras his heart, who made
(His fear permitting) this reply, and said,
Think not (most worthy Champion) that I fear
Because you are Amphialus, or care
To meet you in a Combat: it is well known
Unto this Knight, that I have overthrown
More then you boast of; Nay, indeed it is true,
Replied the Jailer; Sir, be pleased to view
This powerful Warrant, whose Contents will be
A bar to your intended Victory:
This is the Lord Dimagoras, who is now
My Prisoner, being one that scorns to bow,
Or stoop unto the hardiest Knight that lives;
And this is he to whom that Warrant gives
A privilege to take the air: But when
Dimagoras heard those words, he cried, what then?
Must my concealed, well-known valor, lie
Dorment because I want my liberty;
Accursed Fate, cries he, and there he swore;
The more persuaded, still he raged the more;
The courteous Knight desired him to surcease
His passion, and enjoy a quiet peace;
For know, says he, Honor will not permit
A present Combat; for, my Lord, as yet
You are a Prisoner (as I understand
By this informing Paper in my hand)
Therefore (my Lord) If I should boldly enter
A Combat with you, I should more then venture
My life at once; Suppose (My Lord) that Fate
Should Crown me Conqueror, what is my Estate,
Or Fortunes worth? I must be sure to stand
(For boldly breaking of our Kings Command)
In danger of my life; Nor is this all,
For this (thy Keeper) will be sure to fall
Into the hands of Justice: Therefore now
My Lord be sat sfy'd, unknit your brow;
Go get your Liberty, then fight, and spare not,
For now I dare not fight, because I dare not,
Your Warrant ties my hands; What tongue can tell
My sorrows for this chance: My Lord farewell.
The Knight departs, Dimagoras now would fain
Follow, but that the Jailer does restrain,
And keep him back; when he begun to know
He could not, be the more desires to go;
Oh that I had this cursed villain here,
Says he, that I might make my worth appear
In his disaster! Does he think his Arm
Is able to inflict the least of harm
Upon my body, no, I Would make him feel
The full reward of my chastising steel;
Oh how I Would carbonado every part
Of his imperious, his perfidious heart;
I Would make the wretch revoke his former vows,
Or I would hack his body into mouths
To plead for pity; Oh my Spirits boil
TO obtain the triumph of so sweet a spoil:
Audatious wretch, that told me to my face
That he would bring us both to quick disgrace,
If we encountered him, yet I dare say,
The fool was glad we let him go away;
And so were you, my friend, your looks betrayed
The troubles of your heart, you were afraid:
I must confess, replied the Jailer, I
Hate fighting with a true sincerity,
Except I am enforced, and then I show
No mercy, for I kill at every blow;
And had that proud, and vap'ring Rascal stayed
A little, till my fear had been allayed,
You should have seen with what a dext'rous skill
I would have wrought the Traitor to my will,
Nor do not think my fear did wholly rise
From cowardice, but from a quick surprise:
Man were not Man, except he were inclined
To feel the several passions of the mind,
As love, and fear, which often discontents
The mind with several obvious accidents;
Then blame me not; he is valiant can abide,
When danger tells him that he must be tried;
But now he is gone, Nor will I so much strain
My Valor, as to wish him back again:
But now (my Lord) occasion does invite
After this storm, to take a fresh delight:
Let Us haste away, for now our time draws on,
My Lord, forget your passion, let us be gone;
Away they went into the Coach, and eased
('It Is hard to judge which was the better pleased)
Their trembling limbs, where for a little space
We Will leave them, and return unto the place
From whence they came; I hope the Reader will
Pardon a small digression; whilst my Quill
Steps to Corinda's Bowr, and enquire
Of several passages, and then retire:
First we must know this pleasing Bowr, where.
Corinda was, has for a long time binin
A pleasant reseptacle for all such
Distressed Ladies, that had grieved too much
For their unconstant Lovers; There they find
So many rare diversions of the mind,
That fright'ned Melancholy seems to be
A non-apparent in that Liberty.
Here lived the fair Corinda, who indeed
In Virtue, Riches, Beauty, did exceed
Most of her time, nay, I may boldly say
She did exceed, all, but Celania:
This Lady, who to safeguard her delights
Was still attended with a hundred Knights,
And fifty Damsels, who were still to invent
New Rarities to crown her with content;
And whatsoever pastime seemed to be,
Without the Bowr, she stood unseen, to see:
It so fell out, Dimagoras was espied
(With his plump Jailer walking by his side)
To pass that way, who being known by most
Of all the Knights, they soon began to boast
Of their approaching past-time, which they knew
(If plotted well) would presently ensue;
And knowing that Dimagoras his ear
Was always very courteous to hear
Harmonious strains; they presently made choice
Of one, whose more then ordinary voice
Would tame a Tiger, nay make sorrow glad
Having an Art which Orpheus never had,
She has been often times mistook to be
An Angel in a Damsels Liverie;
And first, this Lady was desired to strain
Her magic voice, that so they might obtain,
And bring him near the Bowr; that so his ear
Might with more ease, and more distinctly hear,
Himself reviled, and scorned; and how his name
Was echoed to the world in lasting shame;
Nay, that which vexed him most, was, in regard
The attentive Jailer, listening, over heard
The same expressions, which indeed enforced
His present fury, whilst he thus discoursed:
From whence proceeds those Philomelian airs
Clothed in such angry words; whose's that dispairs
And will not love, if Argalus should woe them
For fear a vile Dimagoras should undo them?
What Hellish tongue pronounced so damned a word?
It is well known Dimagoras is a Lord,
Of more obliging courtesy; his Arm
Was always ready to defend from harm
Distressed Ladies? If I speak a lie,
Oh may some well-prov'd Knight appear, and try
What I dare act; --
-- At that time did resort
(As if that fortune meant to crown the sport
With good success) a Clown, whose well-known name
Was Clinias, much admired for his Fame,
In being infamous; and this was he
That strove to obtain a glorious Victory
Over Demetas; But in short, the Knights
(Being covetous to feast with new delights
Corinda's eyes) did forthwith send away
For Clinias, who arrived without delay;
And being come, they presently declare
Their minds unto him, bid him to prepare,
And arm himself; for now it must be tried
Whether his well-prov'd valor will abide
A fierce assault: Clinias receives this news
With an astonished breast, begins to muse;
Non plust for want of words, thinks he, should I
Show my self so unworthy to deny
This first Command, I should for ever be
Disrobed of honor, clothed with infamy;
But what care I; What honor can proceed
From blood? besides, I truly hate to bleed:
May he, whose steely brow invented first
This thing called fighting, ever be accursed;
I hate it with my soul; besides, I vowed
The last Encounter (if I was allowed
The favor of a Conquest) I would never
Be valiant more, but live at peace for ever;
The very thoughts of fighting is enough
To kill me; pish; this honor's but a puff;
I Will tell an honorable lie, and say
I Am troubled with an Ague, and this day
'Twill sojorn in my bones, I Will not dissemble,
For I have fear enough to make me tremble,
And they shall see it, which sure will make them cease
Their importunity, and yield me peace:
But haste required an answer, therefore they
Bid him resolve whether he would obey
Corinda's pleasure; Clynias having got
An Ague in his tongue, replied not
So soon as was expected; but at last
(Compounding with his fear) and having past
The trouble of his thoughts, he soon displays
The colors of his heart, looks up* and says,
Think not (you most Renowned Knights) that I
Have studied, by my silence, to deny
The honor you impose for I protest
And swear by sweet Corinda, that my breast
Is ready to defend her; but I find
A weakness in my body (not my mind)
Just at this instant, I am half asleep,
(And there he stopped) I feel a spirit creep
Into my bones; Alas I am all frost:
Oh how I shake, my strength, my limbs, are lost:
Action's the best of cure for this desease
Replied the Knight, Now therefore if you please
To mount your Steed, you will very much endeare
Your self unto Corinda, and appear
The object of our praises, for behold
How near they come, and will, if not controlled,
Attempt the Bowr; with that, sad Clinias, cast
His eyes about, and looking, had at last
Observed it was Dimag'ras, then he cries,
Give me my Horse, my Armor, I despise
This thing called cold, hereafter, I Will proclaim
True valor turns a frost into a flame;
Oh how I Will slice the slaves within this hour,
And bring the villains heads into the Bowr,
And lay them at Corinda's feet, that she
May triumph in my glorious victory:
Now Clinias strives to mount his well-known Steed
On the wrong side, whose, almost cripple, speed
Answers his Riders valor; being placed
Within the Sadle, seemed to make great have:
Away he goes, and meeting with his foes,
He told them, they must labor to oppose
His valor, having wilfully transgrest
In their approach, as was before expressed:
Corinda and the Knights were all this while
Within the Bowr, and could not choose but smile,
To hear, and see, how Clinias did behave
Himself, observing very much his grave
Deportment toward them, for he soon descried
Their servile fear, which made him swel with pride;
But yet he fearing that Dimagoras might,
Being (as 'twere) compelled, presume to fight,
He spoke bigg words; and to advance his fame,
And quell their courage, he usurped the name
Of bold Amphialus, which sadly made
Dimag'ras, more then usually afraid;
But when they saw the Page was near at hand
With Horse and Arms, they all three jointly stand,
Gazing upon each other; Clinias thought
TO excuse the matter, and remit the fault,
Because it was the first; but that proved vain,
For then he feared, when he returned again
Unto the Bowr, Corinda would command
His speedy death; time would not let him stand
To reason longer, neither could he stay,
So he in short, concludes to run away;
Which he had done, had not the Jailer shown
His Warrant to him, which was after known
To be an amorous Ballad, for indeed
Clinias (though looking on it) could not read;
But took it in his hand, and for a while
He seems to read, and now, and then to smile
At the Contents; the Jailer having spied
The wrong end upwards, smiled, being satisfied
Of his transcendent ignorance, declared
What was before related, and prepared
To march away, desiring first to know
Whether that he were satisfied or no:
I dare not now (said Clinias) but reveal
My satisfaction, having hand, and seal
To warrant me, and if you please, you may
Take your own liberty, and have away:
At which Dimagoras (though much pleased) expressed
Much discontent with an enraged Breast;
But at the last his seeming discontent
Gladly abated, and away he went;
And so did Clinias, glad withal his heart
Of such a fair advantage to depart;
And now he thinks each munite is an age
Before his near arrival could engage
Corinda to a thankfulness; for he
Thinks he has more then got a Victory;
At last approaching near the Bowr, a Knight
Came forth unto him, wished him to alight,
And enter in, that so he might possess
The honor due unto his worthiness;
Who having entered, presently was brought
Unto Corindas presence, whilst he thought
Himself in Heaven, and that the time drew near
That his long, promised glory should appear;
Corinda viewing him, was well content
To see his clownish garb, and after sent
The favor of a look, to let him know
(As he supposed) her goodness to bestow
Reward upon his merits; but at last
More, then half ravished Clinias, having past
The bounds of silence, opn'd wide, and said,
Most Oderiferous, most refulgent Maid,
I, thy notorious friend, that stand before thee
Will fight for thee, because I do adore thee;
Tell me, my Pigeon, did thou see how I
Behaved my felf, and made the Rascals fly,
That would have done thee wrong; pish, I can make
An Army fly before me for thy sake;
I Will hop over Walls, and Mountains, nay, I Will dive
Into the Ocean to keep thee alive;
Me thinks the world's too small, for when I come
To fight for thee, I groan for Elbow room;
These narrow Confines almost make me sweart
My self to death, for I am grown so great
That I must stretch the world; I here profess
I will enlarg't, or that shall make me less;
How do thou like me, Wench, come, prithee say
Art thou not blessed, to see this happy day
And me, (thy most Renowned Champion) here
To take thy part, when danger shall appear.
With that a noble Knight, which then stood by
Corinda, made to Clinias this Reply,
And said, Sir Knight, this Lady much does wonder
She saw no lightning, when she heard it thunder;
She saw your pastime, but she heard no blows,
You courted them like friends (she says) not foes;
Moreover, it is her pleasure you should be
Respondent to some questions, which shall be
Forthwith proposed unto you* First you are
With speed, and freedom forthwith to declare
Why you mis-call'd your self, and said your name
Was bold Amphialus, that you had slain
So many Knights; she says this must appear
To be untrue, Amphialus is here,
Now looking on you, and ere you depart
Will take revenge upon your perjured heart:
Clinias takes courage (for it is conceit
Makes all our actions either small or great)
And thus replied; Sir Knight, I do conceive
My self much injured, for you would bereave
And rob me of my honor, when as I
Have dearly bought it of mine enemy;
As for Amphialus, I must confess,
(In the relation of his hardiness)
I did him honor, not appropriate
His name, but sung the glory of his fate;
And this was all; moreover, when I saw
The Kings broad Seal, and Hand, it was a Law
To warrant my forbearance, I protest
My vexed soul was never more oppressed
Then at that present; What is, to a Knight
Of valor, more delightful then a fight?
But being charmed by power, what could I do
More then I did; Sir Knight, I speak to you.
Corinda, and her Ladies (all this while
Being in labor with a hearty smile)
Were now delivered, which truly sent
To Clinias his heart no small content;
For fools love all extremes, because, sometimes
They censure smiles to be the greatest crimes;
But when their apter faiths persuades their breast
That every word's a meritorious jest
(Because it is most nonsense) then they toil
(And he commits a fault that does not smile)
And tugg for jests; But yet in Reasons School
Who laughs because, another is a fool,
'Condems himself; I therefore only shall
'Say Clinias was a fool, and that is all;
'How many great pretenders to the Sword
'(As well as he) could never read a word?
'Yet what a bluster in the world they make;
The Sword's their Pen, their Book, with which they take
Such large accounts, that 'twill at last be known
They have expended more then was their own;
But I must haste Dimagoras now draws near
To his desires, where all things do appear
Delightful to his wish; his greedy eyes
(Being satiated with varieties)
Concealed themselves, that so they might obtain
(When reinvited to observe again)
New strength; but at the last they were descried
('It Is known great persons seldom go uney'd)
By several servants, which did then attend
Upon Kalander, who did forthwith send
(Being then a time of war) to prove, and know
Whether that they were enemies or no;
But when Dimagoras was for certain told
This real truth, his troubled heart grew cold,
Not knowing what the matter was, for he
Thought every bush a fatal enemy:
By which example we may sadly find
The strange effects of a tormented mind,
At last 'twas known Kalander only sent
To know for certain what was the intent
Of their approach, which when Dimagoras knew,
He soon looked up, endeavoring to renew
His former courage, giving that respect
Was due; And after, spoke to this effect:
I well perceive (my friends) says he, ye are
Attendants to this Lord, whose pleasant air,
And stately Palace, makes me bold to be
His Orator, desiring liberty
A while to be his Guest, I Will therefore stay
To wait his favorable answer; Nay
Replied the Servants, you may please, my Lord,
TO approach, we know his goodness will afford
A liberal welcome; it is well known, that he
Is not a niggard of his Courtesy.
Therefore be pleased to approach without delay,
And we will be bold (my Lord) to lead the way;
Away they went; At last they drawing near
Unto the house, Kalander did appear
Nobly attended, which Dimagoras spied,
And soon dis-Coach'd himself, and thus aply'd
Himself unto him; If my unhandsome Fate,
My Lord, says he, makes me unfortunate
In my obtaining favor from your hands
For my presumption, here your servant stands
To wait your will; With that, Kalander stayed
The Current of his Language, and thus said.
My Lord, if your offenses be so great
As you express, it is fit I should retreat
From thoughts of pardon; unto which intent
Walk in my Lord, and take your punishment;
I must assure you that 'twill much exceed
The merit of your crime; My Lord, you need
Have more then usual patience: This discourse
Had all most made Dimagoras divorce
His thoughts, from his intents, his wit affords
No sense to understand Kalanders words;
These are but homely Complements, thinks he,
Is this the effect of his lib'ralitie?
Let what will happen, I am fully bent,
Thinks he to enter, and expect the event;
So being led into a spacious Hall
Whose uniformity might justly call
It self most Excellent, and could supply
The ear with rare delights, as well as the eye,
Where being come, Kalander does address
Himself unto him, with a cheerfulness
Disconsonant to what Dimagoras did
Expect, and with a graceful presence bid
Him freely welcome, which did much repair
His drooping spirits, and decrease his care;
So after mutual Ceremonies past
They both sat down, Dimagoras often cast
His eyes upon the Pictures; but before
His nimble senses could half look them over,
His ears were courted with such melodies
That now he is turned all ears, that was all eyes;
He looked about, but could not apprehend
From whence those Heav'n-bred Raptures should descend
But on a sudden (just before his eyes)
Two folding doors flies open, and he espyes
Variety of objects; Now his ears,
And eyes are grown at variance, and he fears
One sense disturbs another, for the eyes,
And ears are so antartique, that it lies
Not in the power of nature to unite
Or reconcile the ears unto the sight;
Although it is not denied they often are
Assistant to each other; yet I dare
Presume to ask this question; tell me whither
That they can see, and hear, and judge together,
Both at one instant; but it is in part
Answered, because Dimagoras his heart
Did truly wish it lay within his power,
To be or deaf, or blind, for half an hour;
My judgement's satisfied enough to know
Both eyes, and ears, were captivated so,
That 'twas, nay very difficult, to tell
Which object did most please, which most excel:
The first thing represented to his eye,
Was a rare Fountain, whose curiosity
Was known by this Inscription writ thereon,
I AM MADE FOR WONDER NOT DESCRIPTION.
Under whose fl^^^t eyes Dame Flora lay
Nursing her offspring for the Month of May;
Each swelling Hillock gladly seemed to be
Much pleased at their so near deliverie;
Whilst from the Crystal Fountain there did flow
Like April showrs, fresh streams to make them grow
Against the general Midwife of the earth
Should show the world a party-colored birth;
Nor was this all; for there, the lofty Pine,
The Beech, the Cedar, did as 'twere combine
To in wilderness this Fountain; but yet so,
That the refreshing Sun might come, and go
To court her streams, being welcomed by a quire
Of warbling Nightingals, who would retire
Into the Thickets, and at every noat
Ravish the Sun, and make him seem to dote
Upon their harmony, and pry about
(As 'twere) to find these feathered Sirens out,
Whilst Zepherus being favorably kind,
Would with a sober, and refreshing wind
Move back the dangling-boughs, whose leaves concealed
A pleasure not much fit to be revealed;
It was Diana, and her Virgin crew,
Going (as often times they use to do)
To bathe themselves; but being near undrest,
The doors clapped too, and would not let the rest
For modesty be seen, so without stay,
Dimagoras cursed the doors, and went away;
By which it does most perfectly appear
His eye, was better pleased then his ear;
The sight, and music ending both together,
Dimagoras knew not what to think, nor whether
'Twere Art, or Nature that had all this while
With sweet delusions labored to beguile
His ravished sense, neither did he much
Desire to know, for his delights were such,
That he (inspired with an enlivening mirth)
Believed himself in Heaven, and not on earth;
And it had past for current I dare swear
Had he not spied his ill-look'd Jailer there
Kalander all this while sat still, and took
A perfect Character of every look;
And so perceiving that his ravished breast
Inclined him to extremes; he thus expressed.
My Lord, your punishment does now present
It self unto you, in the small extent
Of my abilities to entertain
Your Noble self, and your most worthy Train;
But be assured, my Lord, if wishes could
Creat a real Feast, I quickly would
Wish Cleopatra's dainties to delight,
And bring refreshment to your appetite;
But since my wishes, and my fortunes are
Extremely different, I shall forbear
Further discourse, my Lord, it is my intent
To lead you to your further punishment,
Therefore I crave excuse; My Lord, replied
Dimagoras I will follow, and abide
What you shall please to inflict, because I know
No danger can proceed from such a foe:
At last (discoursing as they went) they came
Into a stately Room, the very same
Wherein disguised Parthenia met her dear,
Her Dearest Argalus, after a year
Of hopeless separation; being brought
Into this Room, Dimagoras forthwith thought
There was variety of Heavens, begins
To think what he did there with all his sins;
He turned his head, and as he looked, he spied
His well-paunch'd Jailer staring by his side;
To whom his ready lips begun t'express;
His new-bred joy for this his happiness,
But being soon prevented by a Train
Of Ladies, was enforced to restrain
His nimble tongue, and forthwith turn the stream
Of his discourse; having so good a Theme,
He thus began:
Most splendent Stars, says he,
Your Beauties give my tongue the Liberty
To call you excellent, I must confess
I want a flood of language to express
Those innate virtues which do truly rest
Discovered by each eye, in every breast;
Therefore my admiration shall supply
My tongues defect: My Lord, you soar too high
In your hyperboles, replied the fair.
And virtuous Ladies, neither do we care
To hear such vain Encomiums; and we can
Presume to slight the flateries of man;
( Dimagoras being charmed, he only took
(Though not to speak) the privilege to look,
And gaze about him; but at last he spied
Parthenias Picture, which he sadly eyed,
And blushed at every look, his eyes expressed
A world of passion warring in his breast,
Which grave Kalander seeing, soon addressed
Himself unto him, whilst he thus expressed
Your tell-tale looks (my honored Lord) declare
That you are struck with death, and that you are
Now drawing on, it is therefore good to be
My Lord, prepared for such a certainty,
Death is a speedy change, were his conclusion
Like his exordium, what a strange confusion
Would fall upon us; but our finite pains
Are crowned at last, with everlasting gains;
But since it is so, that death begins t'appear
Upon your Stage of life, My Lord, draw near
Unto your self, for you will find that death
(Whose entrance gives an exit to your breath)
Will prove a rugged, an intrusive guest;
When he is in earnest, it is in vain to jest;
Therefore, My Lord, since time will not permit
Further convenience, if you think fit
To make my breast the office of your will,
I will be just, my Lord, pray stand not still,
It is a busy time: These words being spoke
With serious gravity, had almost broke
Dimagoras his heart, yet after he
(Consulting with himself) did plainly see
There was no signs of death, although his heart
Indeed was wounded with a sudden dart
Shot from Parthenias image; he replied,
And said, my Lord, those sorrows which abide,
And riot in me, are no signs of death,
But the disturbers of my feeble breath;
However, for your good advice, I do
Return those thanks which reason says is due;
But as for death, my Lord, were it as near
As you suppose, i would neither start, nor fear,
For death is but a period to our strife,
A noble passage to a better life;
But I perceive, my Lord, nature does make
It usual for the wisest to mistake;
To which, well pleased Kalander, smiling said,
My Lord, you are mistaken, and have made
A false construction of my Text, it is true,
I must confess, I said, I thought that you
Were struck with death, which if it be denied,
I Will undergo your censure, and abide
The merit of my crime; to which intent
I will expatiate my self, and vent
The reason of my speech. I did discry
When I observed my Lord, your greedy eye
Survey Parthenias Image, that your blood
Re reated to your heart, and frightened stood
A distance from your cheeks, by which I know
This Image was that death which wrought your woe;
And be assured this Image never yet
Was viewed by any, but they would forget
Their present reason, and would seem to be
In love with that they could but only see:
But if a silent, empty shadow, can
Make such impressions on the heart of man;
What would the substance do? Oh this was she
Whose latter days were filled with misery;
Yet in the flowr of age, she was the flowr
Of all her Sex, nor was it in the power
Of Nature to do more; she must excel
That lived, and died without a Parralel;
This, this was she, that both in life and death,
Left an example to succeeding breath;
This is that fair Parthenia, whose glory,
Encreast into an everlasting story;
This, this was she whose Tragi comic age
Begun with pleasure to conclude in rage:
Walk further on, My Lord, and you shall see
Her clothed in her Robes of misery;
But I must crave excu^e, because indeed
The emblems of her sufferings far exceed
The valor of my patience; And, my Lord,
The Laws of consanguinity afford
A reason for my absence; yet if I
Entreat these Noble Ladies to supply,
And execute my place; I hope 'twill be
Sufficient warrant for my liberty;
And so, my Lord, I Will leave you to behold
The saddest story ever yet was told;
And so they parted. Now Dimagoras grows
Conscious unto himself, because he knows,
Or at the least suspects, and fears the event
Would prove injurious; so away they went:
At last being brought into a stately place
Furnished with Pictures, where each lovely face,
Did seem, as 'twere, ambitiously to strive
In silent terms to plead themselves alive;
But walking further, they did soon discover
Abused Parthenia, and her raging Lover,
Her noble Argalus, whose very look
Expressed so much of terror, that it struck
Dimagoras to the heart; for when his eye
(Although unwilling) saw Parthenia lie
Rackt on a bed of horror; he began,
Oh miserable Lady, wrethed man!
What fury hatched this mischief? and displaced
The Pride of nature; she that once embraced
Perfection in her Beauty, now does lie
Perfect in nothing but deformity;
Alas, alas; And is it even so?
Or is it the Painters Tyranny, to show
His cruel skill? Oh most untimely art,
See how death lodges in each senseless part;
I must be gone, or else my heart will break,
I dare not stay for fear her wrongs should speak:
My Lord, you being unconcerned, may stay,
Replied the Ladies, or else pass this way,
Where shall be represented to your sight
An object of less horror, more delight;
Away they went; Dimagoras all the while
Checked his own thoughts, forgeting not how vile
He had been to Parthenia; but at last
Coming into a Room being over-cast,
And rooft with horror, where his gashly eye
Observed Parthenia, and himself stand by,
Drawn to the life; at which displeasing sight,
His heart grew cold, his thoughts were turned to night,
And lowering with revenge, his tongue let fall
A shower of words, he spoke unto them all,
To this effect:
Ladies, says he, this dismal place retains
More shapes of horror then deserves our pains
In staying in it, and our quick recess
Would make our joys be more, our griefs be less,
Therefore be pleased to let us now retire,
And learn to pity what we now admire;
For now, alas she is dead, let us therefore strive
TO express our griefs that once she was alive
TO endure such misery; it is always known
Extremes are changeable, and seldom own
An hour of certainty; for she whose heart
Boasted it self above the power of art,
Or fate to make her happier, was quite
Bereaved of all; her day being turned to night:
Even as a stately Fabric, which but now
We see insulting with a lofty brow
Over the lesser, which would seem as fair,
And much admired if that were not there;
But if a tempest comes, it fails, and why?
Things most in danger, often stand most high;
Even so the fair Parthenia, which indeed
(I hope I speak offenceless) did exceed
Her Sex in beauty, and had so much store
Of pleasure, that her heart could wish no more;
Her joys were sum'd in Argalus, and he
Comprised in her, and yet we sadly see
Fates sudden change; her beauty soon was thrown
And blasted into ruin, she could own
Nothing but woe: Since thus it was decreed,
Oh blame not him so much that did the deed;
Not blame him, cried the Ladies, may he never
See happy minute, but be cursed for ever,
May plagues, and growing horror dwell about,
His cursed heart, and keep all comfort out;
May all his meat turn scorpions, and his drink
Prove fiery-flames; and let all them that think
Upon his cursed name, cry out, and say,
Most vile Dimagoras, wronged Parthenia:
Draw near, my Lord, said they, behold, and see
This treacherous Monster, whose grand Tyranny
Exceeds, almost belief, behold each part,
How they proclaim the treason of his heart:
Behold his dangling locks, which now appears
Like Serpents circling round about his ears;
Observe his megre looks, his hollow eyes,
The silent Heralds of his tyrannies;
See how his griping hands tares off the fair
And bounteous treasure of her flaxen hair;
See how his fury labors to dispense
His rage upon her youthful innocence;
See how he makes her tender Limbs adore
By sad compulsion, the, now happy floor;
Happy, because Parthenia Oh sad fate!
Did there bewail her miserable state;
Happy, because it keeps* and sadly bears
A Monument of her defused tears;
Alas how poor are all the Indian Mines
Compared to this, to this, which far out shines
A Contenent of Rubies, for there lies
The unvalued treasure of Parthenias eyes;
I mean, her tears, her tears, that truly woe
And beg for pity from her cruel foe,
That most accursed Dimagoras, that stands
Darkening the Sun with his prodigious hands;
See how he clouds her beauty with the veil
Of horrid poison; Nothing can prevail
To stop his fury, which resolves to run,
And spend it self until the dreggs are done;
Observe, my Lord, would not her looks prevent
A petty fury in a bad intent;
But this grand Pluto, who resolves to show
The abstract of his malice, and over throw
The Idol of the world, does make her cries,
Her groans, her tears, her sighs; his melodies:
And thus, my Lord, because I sadly see
You seem to sympathize in misery,
With poor Parthenia, I will turn the stream
Of my discourse, and choose another Theme:
It only now remains to let you know
The punishments of her unequalled foe
The vile Dimagoras, which if you, my Lord,
Will please to walk a little, and afford
A willing ear) I shall in short relate,
And let you know the changes of his fate.
It so fell out, that after this most vile,
And perjured wretch, had triumphed over the spoil
Of poor Parthenia's beauty, that he fled
(Firmly supposing he had murdered
Her body with her beauty) from that place
Into a wood, where he a little space
Pampered his soul with the delightful diet
Of full revenge; Thus in a calm of quiet
He floated for a minute; but at last
His wounds being chil'd with the impetuous blast
Of sharp despair, his conscience, which before
Did hardly grumble, then began to roar;
Fear (which indeed does evermore control
Within the confines of a guilty soul)
Did now begin to riot in each part,
And play the Devil in his treacherous heart:
My Lord, pray mind this story, for indeed
It justly claims the priv'ledge to exceed
All stories of this nature -- Madam, said
Dimagoras, if I humbly might persuade,
And woe you to a silence, I should stand
Ever obliged to your strict command;
For at the present my distracted mind
Is rackt with thoughts, and will not be confined
To any thing that is serious; For of late
I have been dogged with an unlucky fate;
Believe me Madam, I can hardly own
A minutes rest; The story is best known
Unto my self; It burns within my breast,
Those griefs are greatest which are least expressed.
Madam divert your thoughts, me thinks I see
A Cloud, which darkens our felicity,
I mean, your Window, which does even woe
My hand to open it, that I might know
What pleasures are without; Excuse, that I
Madam, am bold, to satisfy my eye;
With that away he went, and having set
The window open, he begun to let
His eye survey each rariety; but he
(The more he saw, the more desired to see)
At last espied the Pilgrim, in whose eye
He read the Characters of gravity;
The serious Pilgrim often times would shed
A tear or two, then sigh, and shake his head;
He whispered to himself, and seemed afraid
Himself, should hear himself, but what he said
Dimagoras could not hear, because indeed
Those Ladies that were with him did proceed
In their discourse, which very much oppressed
His troubled mind; but what they then expressed
I will not now relate, for time invites,
And calls us unto new, though sad delights;
But yet I hope my Reader will suppose
The effect of their discourse; for he that knows
Dimagoras is their subject, well may guess
The event, and save me labor to express.
It so fell out, when the declining Sun
Declared unto the world, that he had run
The extremest of his labor, for that day
That sad Celania chanced to pass that way
Where the deep-thoughted Pilgrim sat, who minded
Nothing but his own mind, and being blinded
With contemplation, did not then discover
The near approach of this distressed Lover;
But like a sluggard, who is loath to rise
Until the Sun entrench upon his eyes:
Even so the Pilgrim, when Celania glanced
Before his eyes; roused up, and soon advanced
His drooping head; but this amazed sight
Could not endureth' approach of so much light;
Which she perceiving, suddenly did shroud
Her beauty underneath a Cypress cloud;
Which when the Pilgrim saw, he soon addressed
Himself unto her, and his thoughts expressed
To this effect --
Most pensive Virgin, if my serious thoughts
Has made me guilty of too many faults
In this my bold attempt, which may indeed
Justly assure you that it did proceed
From your own promise, which I claim as due;
Then pardon him who lives to honor you:
And since I see your virtues have inclined
(If I mistake not) your perplexed mind
To the performance of your promise made
To me, after your sorrows had betrayed,
And brought you to my sight, I crave to know
The reason of your grief; Madam, bestow
Your confidence upon me; for I vow
By these my sacred Weeds, that I will bow
My whole endeavors, to procure your peace,
Though by my own disquiet; therefore cease
Those bashful tears which I perceive distill
Out of the Limbick of your timorous will;
Believe me then, each word that shall depart
Out of your lips, shall drop into my heart,
Which now lies open, with a full intent
To take them in when you shall give them vent;
Therefore uncaptivate those thoughts, which lie
Struggling within your breast for liberty:
To which Celania, after she had made
A short, though seeming pause, looked up, and said:
Grave Sir, since thus your Oratorious skill,
Has made me yield to your inviting will;
I shall in short, though sadly, thus relate
The grandeur of my miserable state,
By which relation, I shall boldly thrust
(With an assurance that you will be just)
My life into your hands: May, Heaven, replied
(The Pilgrim) strike me dumb, when I divide
Your secrets from my heart; I will forbear
To tell them to my self, for fear the air,
Being infected with an envious spite,
Should bring your secrets to untimely light;
Therefore with confidence proceed to show,
And tell the reason of your lavish woe;
At which Celania (all her joys being fled)
Contemning life, because her life was dead,
(I mean her Amoronzo) did express
Her self as follows
Know (grave Sir) this dress
You see me in, is but a sad disguise
To change my person, not my miseries:
I had a Father, whose indulgent care,
And careful indulgency did not spare
For cost to educate me to the best
Advantage of the times: I made request
Upon a time unto him, that I might
(Being of years sufficient) take delight
In what I had acquired, and forthwith show
My self at Court; Ah there began my woe!
But to proceed, My Father to fulfill
The wilful humor of my eager will
Perpending not the danger might arise
(Parents affections often wanting eyes)
From my request, did forthwith give consent
For my departure, So away I went,
Where being come, I forthwith did apply
My self unto the choicest company;
My Birth and Fortune was at last declared
Unto the Court, then every one prepared
To do me homage; for indeed, the Court
(That grand Idolater) did soon report,
And Idolize my worth, which made me look
Above my self, I presently forsook
That glorious thing called Virtue, and became
(Having lost the honor of a virtuous Name)
A perfect Courtier, and I soon forgot
How to be good, because I used it not;
And to speak truth, the Court will scarce allow,
Or give acceptance to a modest brow;
They that come there, must forthwith dis-ingage
Themselves of virtue, learn to court the rage
Of every humor; Courtiers, all men know,
Like Butter-flyes, are only good in show;
Yet I Will not blame them all, because l've seen
Bees amongst flies, The Laurel will be green
In spite of frost, yet every one supposes
A Wilderness yields Nettles more then Roses,
And they that live a perfect Courtiers life
As I have done, change true content, for strife;
Virtue at Court is like a blazing Star
Gazed at for wonder -- But I run too far
In this discourse, I therefore will return
Unto my self (who although green) did burn
In flames of Love, not doubting but to find
A sweet refreshment for my tortured mind;
But all in vain, for my distracted breast
(Being subject unto every thing, but rest)
Was so tormented, that I was enforced
To vent my thoughts, And thus in short discourst
With my own thoughts: Cindana, why do thou
(For that is my name) thus play the fool, and bow
To every passion? tell me, can thou show
A reason for thy love? do thou not know
Extremes are dangerous; Ah cruel he
That flattered me into this misery;
Ah The phrastus! how have thou betrayed --
But here the current of her speech was stayed
By an approaching Lady, who desired
Some secrecy; the Pilgrim soon retired,
And gave them opportunity; but he
Began to muse, and wonder what would be
The sequel of her Story, whilst indeed
She was, her self, unwilling to proceed;
So being glad of this advantage, took
Her leave, and so immediately forsook
The Garden, telling him withal, that she
(Having begun to unfold her misery
Unto his ears) would take another day
To perfect what she then begun to say,
Away she went. The Pilgrims heart affords
Nothing but wonder; her promiscuous words
Torment his soul, because he could not find
(Although he labored with a serious mind)
The aim of her discourse; he therefore broke
His silence into language, and thus spoke
Unto himself: What, are my senses grown
So dull, so stupid, that they cannot own
So much as common reason? sure my brain
Is very empty, or her words are vain;
The time has been when I could understand
Cloudy Enigma's, when I could command
The knottiest intricacies to appear
Before my apprehension, plain, and clear;
But to be baffled by a woman's wit
Is more then peevish nature can forget;
Yet I must needs confess, and say I lie
Under a most ingenious tyranny;
But why was I so curious, as to know,
And hear the reason of her stubborn woe?
What have I gained, but wonder, doubt, and trouble?
Inquisitive hearts are still tormented double;
Her story was so clouded, that the eye
Of my dull sense, cannot at all discry,
Or guess the sequel: First she said, her life
Was wrapped up in each word, which made a strife
Within my thoughts, for fear that they should be
Born into words, and make discovery
Of her disigns; well, may she never rest
Till I have heard, and she has spoke the rest;
And so farewell vain thoughts, my serious mind
Must aim at higher things, farewell, unkind
And cruel Virgin; I will now retire
Into my self, and never more enquire
After thy endless story, for indeed
I fear that thou were fearful to proceed,
Or, at the least, ashamed; The Court, I know
Receives the good, but seldom keeps them so;
But stay, my thoughts, me thinks I did espy
Something within the circuit of her eye
That I have seen before; Me thinks her face
Is radiated with a glorious grace;
But being masked with sorrow, she lies hid
From my remembrance, and I am forbid
To make enquiry, therefore I Will surcease
My present thoughts, and shroud my self in peace;
And thus we will leave them both, and now return
Unto Dimagoras, who begins to burn,
And flame with anger, every word they spoke
Battered his conscience, and had almost broke
His treacherous heart; The Ladies, did indeed
At that time all endeavor to exceed
Their usual passions, every one did throw
A dagger at him, and would often bestow,
The name of Villain on him: Thus his ear
(Although unwilling) was enforced to hear
Himself reviled, but yet he durst not show
His rage in words, for fear that they should know,
Or at the least, mistrust, that it was he,
That was the Author of that villainy,
And they, as being willing still to add
To his belief, would often wish they had
The Traitor there, that they might jointly take
Revenge in part, for wronged Parthenias sake.
Dimagoras being tired, does now prepare
For his return, but scarcely could forbear
To show his anger; Yet at last, he took
His solime leave, returned his thanks, forsook
Kalanders house, being not a little proud
To think that he had passed so great a crowd
Of difficulties; He does now begin
To think what an unpardonable sin
He had committed, in respect he staid
So long from his Lutosa, who had made
A battery in his soul: But here it is best
To take the advantage of a breathing rest;
Therefore (My Muse) retire, we must not play
Too much at first, but beg another day
From our more serious thoughts; till then, desire
The Reader to excuse thee, and retire.
The end of the fourth Book.
