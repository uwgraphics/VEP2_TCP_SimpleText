OLD JEMMY An Excellent New Ballad.
To an Excellent New Tune, called, Young Jemmy:
[1]
OLd Jemmy is a Lad
Right lawfully descended;
No Bastard born nor bred,
Nor for a Whig suspended:
The True and Lawful Heir to the Crown,
By Right of Birth and Laws,
And bravely will maintain his own,
In spite of all his Foes.
[2]
O^d Jemmy is the Top
And Chief amongst the Princes
No Mobile gay Fop,
With Brimigham pretenses:
A Heart and Soul so wondrous great,
And such a conquering Eye,
That every Loyal Lad fears not
In Jemmy's Cause to die.
[3]
Old Jammy is a Prince
Of Noble Resolutions,
Whose Powerful Influence
Can order our Confusions:
But Oh! He fights with such a Grace,
No Force can him withstand;
No God of War but must give place
Where Jemmy leads the Van.
[4]
To Jemmy every Swain
Does pay due Veneration;
And Scotland does maintain
His Title to the Nation.
The Pride of all the Court he stands,
The Patron of his Cause,
The Joy and Hope of all his Friends,
The Terror of his Foes.
[5]
Maliciously they Vote,
To work Old Jemmy's Ruin,
And zealously promote
A Bill for his undoing:
Both Lords and Commons most agree
To pull His Highness down;
But ('spite of all their Policy)
Old Jemmy's Heir to the Crown.
[6]
The Schismatic and Saint,
The Quaker and the Athiest,
Swear by the Covenant,
Old Jemmy is a Papist;
Whilst all the Holy Crew did plot
To pull His Highness down,
Great Albany the Noble Scot
Did raise unto a Crown.
[7]
Great Albany they swear,
He before any other,
Shall be immediate Heir
Unto His Royal Brother,
Who will, in spite of all his Foes,
His Lawful Rights maintain,
And all the Fops that interpose,
Old Jemmy's York again.
[8]
The Whigs and Zealots Plot
To banish him the Nation,
But the Renowned Scot
Has wrought his Restoration.
With high Respects they treat his Grace,
His Royal Cause maintain;
Brave Albany (to Scotland's Praise)
Is Mighty York again.
[9]
Against his envious Fates
The Kirk has taught a Lesson;
A Blessing on the States,
To settle the Succession.
They real were, both Knight and Lord,
And will His Rights maintain;
By Royal Parliament restored,
Old Jemmy's come again.
[10]
And now He Is come again,
In spite of all Pretenders,
Great Albany shall Reign
Amongst the Faiths Defenders.
Let Whig and Brimigham repine;
They show their Teeth in vain;
The Glory of the British Line,
Old Jemmy's come again.
