A SEASONABLE and Necessary WARNING Concerning present DANGERS and DVTIES, From
the COMMISSIONERS Of the GENERAL ASSEMBLY, Unto all the MEMBERS Of this KIRK.

EDINBURGH, Printed by EVAN TYLER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty,
1650.

25. Iunii, 1650. Postmeridiem. A seasonable and necessary Warning concerning
present dangers and duties, from the Commissioners of the General Assembly,
unto all the Members of this Kirk.
IF the eminency of the danger and the necessity of our duty did not constrain
us, we had rather chose to be silent then to emit any public warning to the
land within so few days of the meeting of the General Assembly; but we should
not only run the hazard of just blame from them, but also be conscious to
guiltiness in our selves, if we did not in a time of so great strait, give
warning to the Lords people both of their danger, and of their duty.

The Insolent and strange actings of that prevailing party of Sectaries in
England these years past, in reference to Religion and Government, are so well
known, and have been so often and fully laid open in the former Warnings,
Remonstrances, and Declarations of this Kirk, that we need not now take up much
time in representing the same. Albeit the Reformation of the Church of England,
and the advancing of the work of Uniformity there, in Doctrine, Worship,
Discipline, and Government was the great duty that the Lord called that Land
unto, and which all the people of God in these three Kingdoms did engage
themselves in Covenant to endeavor to the utmost of their power; yet does that
work so much desired and longed for by all the lovers of Sion in these Nations,
and all that concerns Religion, lie in the dust altogether forgotten and
despised by those men, and in stead of the beauty and order that should be in
the house of God, a vast toleration of many gross errors is allowed, whereby
so many and so monstrous blasphemies and strange opinions in Religion have been
broached and are vented in England, as the like has not been heard of almost
in any generation. And though Monarchy and the Power of Parliaments was the
ancient and long continued Government of that Kingdom, yet have those men
usurped above the Parliament whose servants they were, and by open violence
driven away many, and imprisoned some of the Members thereof, and have not
only taken away the house of Lords and destroyed the late King, but also
subverted Monarchy it self, and turned the Foundations upside down, and labor
to wreath the voke of their oppression upon the necks of our brethren in
England, not only in regard of that which concerns their bodies and estates,
but also in regard of that which concerns their souls and consciences, whereof
that Engagement that is now pressed in England is a present and public
testimony, being a sore bondage under which many in that land now groan; whose
case and sufferings for the work of God we desire, not only to remember daily
before the Lord in our prayers and supplications, but in every thing to regard
it as if it were our own, being confident that such as love the truth, and
cleave to the Covenant in these Lands, shall obtain mercy of God to be
faithful in the midst of temptations, and that the Lord will not suffer them
to be tempted above that they are able to bear, but will give unto them the
issue with the tempation.

This party after that they have acted such things in England, and also sore
afflicted and oppressed our brethren in Ireland, now conceiveing that they
cannot be established, and that they cannot eat the fruit of their own devices
without contradiction, as long as the Kirk and Kingdom of Scotland stands in
their way, threaten us with a war, by drawing their Forces Northward, and
sending them in small parties toward the Border, that it may be the less
discerned what they intend to do: And if the Lord in his righteous and wise
dispensation shall suffer them to invade this Land, as it is to be seared, that
the Gangrene of their errors may take hold upon men of ignorant and unstable
minds, who have not received the love of the truth; So may we, if they
prevail, look for confusion and desolation, and that the Pil ars both of
Religion and Government shall be ruined and razed in this, as well as in our
neighbor land. It does therefore in the first place concern all the
Inhabitants in this Nation to draw near to God, and to mourn for their own
iniquities, and for all the ignorance and prophanity and backsliding that is in
the land, and to study to make peace with God in Jesus Christ: The continuance
and increase of many of those sins, for which formerly we seemed to have been
humbled, does doubtless grieve the spirit of God, and may if they be not
speedily and sincerely repented of, and forsaken, provoke him to give us over
to the lust of our adversaries; Our King, our Princes, our Nobles, our Pastors,
teachers, and people have sinned; Let us therefore search and try our ways,
and turn again to the Lord: Let us lift up our heats with our hands to God in
the heavens, that he may spare and save his people, that they be not a prey to
the enemy.

In the next place, As the Parliament of this Kingdom have taken care for
putting the land in a Posture of Defense, so we hope that none shall be so
negligent of their duty, and so insensible of their danger, as not to give
cheerful obedience to the lawful commands of their superiors in those things
that concern the security of Religion, and peace of the Kingdom, and that are
necessary for the defense of the cause and of their native country; but that
every man in his station and calling will willingly and cheerfully acquit
himself in the diligent and faithful performance of all the duties that
relate unto those ends.

It is far from our meaning that any who are tainted with Malignancie and
Disaffection to the work of God, should be allowed or permitted to associate or
join themselves together by parties in Arms, much less do we mean that we
should associate and join with them, or that they should be employed or made
use of, or countenanced or permitted to be in our Armies. The Lord has so far
cleared his mind both by his word and works against these things, that they are
very blind who are not convinced herein; and we have made so solemn public
confession of this sin that relates unto Malignants, and so solemnly engaged
our selves against the same, that they among us, who should again hazard upon
it, should seem to be desperately perverse: It were not only to give great
ground of encouragement to the Sectaries, before whom Malignants have already
so often fled and fallen, but to discourage the hearts, and weaken the hands of
men of Integrity and godliness, who could hardly expect a blessing in the
fellowship of such; nay, it were from the words of our own former Confession
and Engagement unto duties, to proclaim a judgment against the land, till it
were consusumed without remedy. We are therefore bold in the Lords name to
warn the Honorable Estates of Parliament, and all whom it concerns in the
land, that they may be far from such a thing, and that they may take care in
their respective places and Stations, to purge Judicatories, and Committees of
all scandalous and disaffected men, and speedily and effectually to go about
the removing and purging out from the Army all men of a scandalous
conversation, and of questionable integrity and affection in the cause of God,
and that they employ none but such as are of a blameless conversation, and of
approven Integrity in the Lords work: It shall be a shame for any in this land,
to be so faithless and unbeleeving, as because of the scarceness of men to
make use of others, then such as are thus qualified. The Lord has not only
spoken it in his word, and verified it in his works in the days of old, but
has let us see it with our own eyes, that it is all one with him to save with
few or with many, and that a few, whom God will countenance, are more worth
then many against whom he has a controversy.

It needs not be matter of stumbling or terror unto any, that the army of
Sectaries go masked under a vale of seeming holiness, and that their
interprises and defignes have been so long and so often attended with success:
These who know them well, will acknowledge that many of them are loose and
dissolute in their way, and though some of them walk more circumspectly, yet
how can they be accounted truly tender and Godly, who love to walk in the
Immaginations of their own hearts, and in the light of their own fire, and in
the sparks that they have kindled, corrupting the truth of God, approving
errors in themselves, and tolerating them in others; and who having power in
their hands, labor only to establish saftie for themseves, altogether
neglecting those things that concern the Honor of God, and the Kingdom of
his Son Jesus Christ: If any of them have any thing of the seed of God in
them, it cannot but be much blasted with the wind of their own vain
inventions, and choked and keept down with the cares of their corruptions:
These who shall compare their proceedings with the word of God, and the Solemn
League and Covenant, or look to the effects that follows thereupon either to
Religion or government, or to the bodies or souls of men, shall find that
notwithstanding of any pretext, their way is much to be detested and abhorred.
Neither does the Lord spare to execute judgment against seducers and
corrupters of the truth, because they seem not to be subject to personal
out-breakings in their lives; Is it not the ground of the great threatenings
against Antichrist, that he makes many drunk with the cup of his abominations,
which yet for most part are covered with a vail of external devotions? And can
the many antichrists now in England eschew to partake of his plagues, who in so
great a measure partake of his sins.

The success of that party proves not the goodness of their cause, or that
they shall prosper still; The Lord who is wonderful in council, and excellent
in working has been pleased to put the rod of his anger, and the staff of his
indignation in their hand, for executing of his wrath against malignants,
because of the enmity and opposition of that generation unto the cause and
people of God: But if they shall invade this land, and exalt themselves against
the Lords inheritance, and the people that are in Covenant with him, For whose
sake the Lord did clothe them with power for a time, for taking vengeance upon
his enemies, Then shall they stumble and fall, and be broken in pieces: Though
the host of Senachribe did prevail against Samaria, yet did they fall in
Judah, and he did return with shame and was slain with the sword in his own
land. That party has as yet no cause to boast that God has prospered them in
arms against the Covenant, or against a praying people steadfast in the Lords
cause, following his way, and waiting upon him for help and success: All their
encounter have hitherto bin against Malignants; and now the Lord having
performed so much of his work against that generation, who knows but the
Sectaries day may also be coming, and that when the state of the question shall
be changed, God may turn his hand upon them, and bring upon them the judgments
of abroken Covenant, as he has ever don to all that look that way.

We desire that not only others, but the Sectaries themselves may consider,
that when England was very low, and well nigh brought under the feet of the
popish, prelaticall and Malignant party, That this Nation was then much
solicited for their assistance and relief, and even by some of these who have
since that time been very active and isntrumental for the party which now
prevails in that land: The Kirk and Kingdom of Scotland were then so
compassionate of their brethrens condition, that they were willing to join in a
League and Covenant with them, which both Kingdoms even many of those who are
now in the Army did solemnly swear and subscribe: In prosecution of the ends
thereof, this Kingdom did send into England a considerable army, by whose
assistance the power of the Malignant party was broken and brought low, and
the Parliament and army of England put in such a condition, that they needed no
more fear the strength of their enemies. This league and Covenant which was the
foundation of Englands and the Armies deliverance and saftie, the army has
now forgotten and trodden under foot, and walk in all their proceedings no
less contrary thereto, then darkness is unto light: Neither does it satisfy
them to do so in their own land, but they threaten us also with war, for no
other reason, but because we cleave to our duty in these things, to which
England stands no less obliged unto by Covenant before the Lord then we do.
We may confidently assert and profess before the world that the Lords people
in this land are not conscious to themselves of any wrong done to that
prevailing party in England: The engagment in the year. 1648. was no less
abhorred, and testified against by the Kirk of Scotland, and by these that are
now in place and power in the State, and by all the godly in the land, Then it
was by that party themselves; Which did so far convince the House of Commons
That in their letter to the Generell Assembly of this Kirk in the same year,
They profess that they are assured, that these Impions and unwarrantable
actions cannot be done with the approbation and assent of the Religious and
well affected people of the Kingdom of Scotland, and that they do understand,
that there are very few amongst these who were in the engagement against them
that first engaged with them in the Covenant and cause, but such as are
professed enemies to them, how ever they were then content to proceed thereunto
that they might be the better decieve the people of England, And that therefore
they are unwilling to impute such evils to this Nation in General: It is known
how many servent prayers and supplications were powered out in this Land before
the Lord against that engagment, and we think we may without boasting say,
that those prayers had as much influence upon the defeat thereof, as all the
power of that army: And since that time that engagement has been publicly
disavowed, disclaimed and repealed by the Parliament of this Kingdom. Neither
has that party any thing to challenge us concerning Malignants, both Kirk and
State having constantly followed, and being still about their duties against
them, without conniving at, or complying with them in their courses. It is true
that this Kingdom and Kirk have protested and testified against the proceedings
of Sectaries in reference to Religion and Government; Which we could not but
do, unless we had forgotten our duty, and the Christian mutual ties that lie
upon us, not only as sister Churches, but as Covenanted Churches, and so make
our selves partakers of their sins, and exposed our selves to the hazard of
their plagues. We in this Land being therefore conscious to our selves of
nothing but duty; If they shall invade us for following the same, Shall not
GOD look upon it and avenge it?

Whilst we incite men to their duty in the defense of the Kingdom against
invasion, and encourage them in performance of the same, We desire not to be
mistaken, or that any should so far misconstrue our meaning, as though we did
thereby intend to stir up unto, or approve of an invasion of the Kingdom of
England, or an engagement in war against the same. In relation to peace or war
in these Nations, we cannot but very much commend and approve the resolutions
of the Parliament of this Kingdom, expressed in their Letter of the 6th of March
to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and Instructions sent therewith to
their Commissioners 1649. and now again renewed in another Letter to the same
Speaker of the House of Commons, wherein they acknowledge their obligations,
and declare their resolutions to observe the rule of remonstrating first the
breaches of peace, of craving just reparations, of using all fair means, of
giving a preceding warning of three months before any engagement in these
Kingdoms in war, And do hold forth this way of procedour in clearing each
others, and dealing plainly, as agreeable, not only to particular Treaties, and
to the many Ties, Bands, and Declarations past betwixt the Kingdoms, but also
to the Law of GOD, and practice of His people in his word, and to the common
law and practice of heathen nations, much more Christian Covenanted Kingdoms;
And plainly profess their confidence, that the Covenanted GOD of these
Kingdoms, who did take order with these of this Nation, who did unlawfully
engage against England, in the year 1648. does still live and reign, and will
being shame and ruin upon whatsoever party in either of these Nations, that
without a necessary cause and clear calling, and without observance of the
aforesaid rules and order shall offend, and invade the other Nation: In all
which we do agree with them in our judgments and resolutions, and conceive
that the whole Land is bound to tread the same steps, and to walk according to
the same rules.

Albeit we be diligently to take heed of the danger that threatens from
Sectaries, and faithfully to bestir our selves in our places and stations in
the use of all lawful and necessary means for preventing of the same: Yet are
we not to forget, but also with the same diligence and care to take heed of
these dangers and snares that threaten the work and people of GOD from
Malignants. Malignancie though a very evil weed, yet is not plucked up, but
still continues to be one of the raging sins of this Land, it being the snare,
wherewith loose hearts, who cannot endure Christ's yoke are most readily taken.
Hence it is that there be still many of that stamp in all the three kingdoms,
who drawing encouragements to themselves, from the influence they have upon the
Kings Counsels, and hardening themselves in their way, by the proceedings of
Sectaries, do still follow their former designs, and wait for their day, and
would rejoice in the ruin or halting of these, who adhere to the Covenant: And
experience proves that many of these who have seemed to repent of, and abandon
that way, yet do not really shake off that sin, that hangs so fast on, but upon
new temptations fall again upon that same wickedness, and prove worse then of
before; which may be a caution to us not suddenly to trust them. We make no
doubt, but that Malignants will by all means endeavor that there may be room
left for them to undermine the work and people of GOD, and engage the Kingdom
in a new war, upon terms of their devising, destructive to Religion and the
Covenant.

In reference to dangers upon the right hand and upon the left, besides any
duty already represented to us: We conceive it incumbent to us, seriously to
recommend the following particulars to all the Land, especially to these that
are in trust, either in Judicatories or Armies.

1. First to watch and pray that in nothing they be deceived, or come short of
the duty, whereunto the Lord calls them in a time of so many temptations and
great difficulties.

2. Every one would labor not only for the knowledge of the truth, but to have
the power and love thereof engraven on their hearts, that they may from an
inward principle of grace and spiritual life avoid erour, and all the snares
which lead thereunto, and be encouraged to contend earnestly for the Faith,
which GOD has been pleased to deliver to his Kirk in this Land.

3. Not only is open Malignancie to be avoided, but men would watch that
enmity against the work and people of GOD, which ordinarily is the birth of
jealousy and discontent and of familiar conversing with such as are
disaffected to or lukewarm in the cause of GOD, steal not into their hearts,
and gain not upon their affections by degrees; Experience almost of all
backsliding times and persons has proven, that the fellowship of men of a
disaffected or lukewarm temper, blunts the edge of tenderness and zeal, and
steals away the heart, first from honest instruments, and then from the cause
it self: There have been and are still some in the Land, who in a cunning way
of insinuation foment jealousies, and act divisions, whilst they seem to be
friends to the Cause, and by this means do more harm then others by open
violence; These we would mark and avoid them, that we may neither endanger our
selves, nor give offense unto others, nor prejudice the Cause of GOD.

4. We would take diligent heed, that in nothing we recede from the just and
necessary desires of this Kirk and Kingdom, propounded to his Majesty for
securing of Religion and settling the peace of the Kingdom; But that we cleave
closely to our former resolutions in those things: If we remit and grow slack,
and yield in any of them, as it shall increase the hopes and endeavors of
carnal and disaffected men, so shall it provoke GOD against us to leave us to
our selves, till we be plunged in a pit of backsliding.

5. It concerns us to take heed that we do not tread the steps of those, who
carried on the late unlawful engagement against the Kingdom of England in any
thing already condemned by this Kirk and Kingdom, especially to beware of
changing the state of our Cause, or altering the matter of our qua rell, either
by laying aside of GODS interest and tak ng up of man's, or by preferring or
equalling man's interest unto GODS: This were to turn upside down the whole
tenor of our Principles and procedors, and not only to spoil us of all the
comfort we can look for from our Covenant, but also to bring upon our selves
the guilt and reproach of all the sin of those, who carried on that engagement,
so much condemned and born testimony against in this Land.

6. We would beware of losing the advantage of defenders, seeing our strength
most consists in the equity and clearness of the Cause, and the holy and
righteous way in pursuing of the same: It shall be better for us, rather to
endure straits for a time, then by precipitating and making have in the dark,
to rush against the wall, and spoil our selves of that peace and comfort, which
we may have in waiting till GOD go before us.

7. We desire that all the Land may be still pouring out their prayers and
supplications before GOD, that the Kings Majesty may really and wholly abandon
all Malignant principles and Counsels, and join cordially in the Covenant and
Cause of GOD.

8. As all the people of GOD throughout the Land would be careful to discern
of dangers and avoid snares from, and compliances with both Sectaries and
Malignants, so would Ministers be diligent and faithful in pressing of these
duties, and that in a solid and convincing way, and labor to make it appear
that they speak not against the one or the other from passion or interest, but
upon the grounds of divine reason, and from the light and authority of GODS
Word, that so they may make themselves manifest to the consciences of their
hearers, and stop the mouths of gainsayers.

Finally all the inhabitants of the Land would be aware of pride and carnal
confidence, and in a humble way would wait upon the LORD, and tread the steps
of holiness and righteousness, and he who has done great things for us,
shall yet save us.
