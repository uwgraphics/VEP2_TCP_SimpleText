EZEKIEL 34. 6, 10. My sheep wandered thor^w all the mountains, and upon every
high hill: yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none
did search or seek after them.

Therefore thus says the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I
will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the
flock, neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more: for I will deliver
my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.

Inprimis,

THe Popes old Decrees and Decretalls which are very useful for Civilians and
Canonists, who study the Popes old Canon law, and thereby get great wealth, and
likewise they are of singular use for Prelates to teach them church government
after the fashion of Rome and church policy, after the Popes own most holy
manner, how to frame Churchwardens articles to bring in great store of
Presentiments and money to uphold the pomp and state of the Prelates Officers
and Followers.

2. The old book of Canons which for their antiquity are now something stale,
yet they have been of singular use for Chancellors, Registers, Proctors,
Pa^a^ors, Promoters and such like, and the only thing whereby they have got
their livings by citing, presenting, informing, suspending excommunicating and
molesting many of the best ministers and people, until their purses come off
handsomely, which is the final cause of making this book of Canons, which lucky
book has been gainful to Prelatists as ever Purgatory was to the popes
Kitchen.

3. The new book of Canons which for want of wit and skill in the makers (who
were some of them no better then doults) were made clean Kam contrary to
expectation, and something too boisterous and violent, so that at the first
shooting off they recoiled upon the authors and knocked down their makers, and
being neither made of bell metal nor Parliament proof they burst in the
discharging being over charged with Altarwise powder ammunition shot and leaden
et cetrae whereby their metal is marred so that it is held but vain for the
Convocation to mould or cast them anew: yet they are worth their weight of
brown paper at any time for Grocers, Chandlers, Tobacco-shops, and Physicians;
for such patients as have laxes and trotting agues going often to thee stool;
if they have but a new Canon in their hand they may come off more cleanly then
the Convocation did who marred them in the making:

4. The new Canon Oath, or Oath for Prelacy, which Oath was intended for many
singular uses as the sinful sinod knew very well; as, 1. To swear up the
Bishops though the devil himself cannot do it. 2. To swear down all the
honest ministers in England who for refusing this periurious Oath should
presently be deprived of their livings though their wives and children were
beggerd, so that there might be great store of church livings void whereby his
little Grace and the rest of the reverend Fathers might have choice for their
chaplains and prefer their mad kindred cracked Chambermaids light kinsewomen
and younger brother (as Oxford petitioned) and might put in such idol
shepherds dumb dogs and Baal Priests as should be sworn slaves to the Prelates
and they to forswear and periure all the fatbelly Prelatists who should take
this Oath and must swear to take it willingly (though no man in the world would
not rather be free then bound) so that they being become odious to God and good
men might stick faster to the Bishops on whom they depend both for bodies
souls and estates, but this Oath being now cashiered by some critical fellows
of the Temple who have proved wiser then the sinod it will hardly be valied as
it might have been.

5. A numberles number of many hundred thousand weight and an infinite
multitude of yards and else of length and breadth and many millions of fathoms
deep of an et cetra, a most precious thing in the Canon oath a thing of so
great weight, worth, length, breadth deepnesse, thickness and bulk, that it
is beyond all extensions dimensions so that the goodly wise fathers of the late
more than holy sinod (though they put it in with both hands) yet all those
monstrous wise and hugely tearned men themselves never knew either the
quantity, quality, value, worth or weight of this, et cetera, it may be said of
this; that Datur processus in infinitum, it may be divided in semper
divisibilia and expounded in semper exponenda, they and their successors might
from time to time and at all times make of it what they would so that if the
Bishops should lose theier Bishoprics and all but this, this alone were riches
enough for them and theirs for ever, and it is pity but that they should take
them this and be packing.

6. A most rare and super excellent thing called the oath Ex Officio or the
Beneficial oath, for never was auricular confession so useful and gainful to
the iugling priests of Rome as this has bin to Prelates, for that did but
only make woman and people to confess their relapses and maids their
backslidings: and only touched deeds done and the Priests would pardon them
but this Oath makes men to confess their thoughts, for which sometimes the
Bishop will make them pay dear, and if at any time either the Bishop or any of
his shavelings have not their bags crammed by Church Wardens presentiments or
Parrators information, then they send for some minister of honest man whom they
know to be not so desperately wicked, as their injurious maintainers, and tender
him this oath, which if he refuse, to prison he goes if he were as good as George
a Green, and if he take it, he must either forswear and damme himself as the
Bishop does, or else betray himself and confess his most private matters,
words, and the very thoughts of his heart which he poor man chooses rather to
do, and so puts himself in the mouth of the wolf, than to periure and damme
himself, and to go to hell with Bishops, where upon he confessing, the Bishop
suspends, exco^municates, deprives, degrades, imprisons or punishes the poor
man at his pleasure, then he being in this woeful case will be very glad to
speak with some of the Bishops Officers, who will show him so much friendly
honesty as to take a great bribe to speak a small word for him, and so perhaps
meets with the man who for that purpose first caused him to be questioned and
so he seeing his friend, and the Bishop feeling his man's pulses, gives the
poor man some releasement, though he will not quite discharge him, but that
his servants may at other times have some feeling of him, and thus this Oath Ex
Officio has formerly been wondrous beneficial though now it grow something
old and rotten, and begins to stink and putrefie, yet it will pass current in
some countries, as Italy and Spain, and some part of France, but by all means
carry it not into Scotland, for they be such resolute fellows they will put it
in a poke mantle and hang it on blind Balaams Nagge and send it packing to Rome
where is no need of it because there is already great plenty of this and many
such like.

7. A Most profitable and gainful piece of Prelaticall policy, to wit, the
rubric of the Liturgy or Service, for the most wise and politic prelates,
knowing that men are of diverse minds and dispositions, have so framed the
rubric of the service book that it is improbable that all men should like of
it, and almost impossible, that all man should follow it so strickly as the
Bishops inioyn it, and among some good things, taken out of the Bible, they
have mingled some bad things taken out of the Mass book, and then if any
honest minister do but omit by oversight some things least necessary, or pass
by other, some things most offensive or leave out any thing which is most
fabulous, he is to be had before the Bishop either by the Church Warden, who
are sworn to present him, or by the Pararors or some such like who are ready
to inform against him and the Bishop (who takes himself to be the Lord of the
church) perceiving him to be a man of some great conscience (which is an odious
thing to some Bishop to have some care to discharge his duty uprightly, he
hates him and persecutes him and brands him with the nicknames of Puritan
Brownist scismaticke and precise fellow, and never leaves him till he either
make him forsake all conscience and honesty, or else his living and country and
such examples as these there have been many thousands so that this is an
excellent and gainful rubric to the Bishops Officers who while these things
are in agitation have many a good feeling, whom here I leave to feel the
justice of our happy Parliament.

8. Certain things of great antiquity and almost as ancient as the subtilty of
the Serpent; so wit Ceremonies, which though it might be thought that Bishops
might spare them without prejudice to themselves, yet those politic Prelates
(for what reason themselves know best) hold that no Ceremony, no Bishop, and
they are so little in their defense, that before they will loose one corner of
a cap, they will throw the whole Miter off for it, or one end of a Cross, they will
break all the crosier to shivers, or one sleeve of a Surplice, they will burn
their Lawne sleeves, and it is pity but that Bishops and Ceremonies should both
be sent packing to Rome the place of their original.

FINIS.
