A POEM ON His Majesty's Return TO WHITE HALL.
WHEN from his Nest the Royal Eagle flies,
Forced thence by threatening Storms and thundering Skies;
The tender Brood, their Guardian tare away,
To Sacrilegious Hands becomes a Prey.
The dire Effects of Violence we see,
That straight tears down the consecrated Tree.
So when a Monarch from his Seat withdraws,
Empire becomes a Prey to griping Claws,
Of Ravenous Kites and Savage Tigers Jaws.
Then welcome Caesar to thy trembling Realm;
If Pilots in the Storm forsake the Helm,
Prevailing Waves the Ship must soon o're-whelm.
If dangerous Courses in the dark we steered,
Let Us take new Measures when the Skies are cleared:
The Fiends that raised the Tempest now dispersed,
Why should not now our Fortune be reverst?
The guilty Jona's to the Billows give,
But let the Royal Boat and Pilot live:
Far be the Rashness from a private Muse,
Wholly to charge or wholly to excuse.
Who can but wish to have the Tempest cease!
And every Voice must vote for public Peace.
Let Achan fall, the Troubler of the Land;
Let Dagan tumble, but let Caesar stand.
When to the Hive a Factious Drone may steal
Of it is rich Sweets, to rob the Public Weal;
Who only for his lazy Cell purloins,
(Lazy, but active in accursed Designs.)
The Offender duly punished, to the Hive
Safety and Peace may once again arrive:
But if the Royal Be is once oppressed,
Inevitable Fate o're-whelms the rest.
The guiddy Swarm will ruin their own Toil,
And Rabble Bees the Public Treasures spoil.
When Hurricanes the Kaden Vessel shake,
All Hands should join to save the general Stake:
But if the Pilot from the Harbor be forced,
The common Bonds of Safety are divorc't;
By Winds and Waves the shattered Barque is tossed.
One Sailer takes a Plank, and one a Mast,
But gaping Syrges swallow All at last.
Then welcome Caesar to thy Royal Seat,
Let Britains Foes and Britains Fears retreat;
But Britain once again be safe, and Caesar great.
FINIS.
