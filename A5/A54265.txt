A SOLEMN CALL TO True Humiliation.
FAsting, Fasting and Mourning is called for: And the cause why Fasting and
Mourning is called for, is; because of the great and universal Apostasy from
the Life and Power of Godliness that has been, and that still is, in this our
Age. And tho the Apostasy has been great, yet, there are some Nathaniels that
are in sadness, and grieved for it. And unless Purity and Holiness be brought
forth amongst you, all your Preaching, and all your Hearing, is in vain. For, a
perfect, and entire Resignation is called for, and required [by the LORD] of
all, that, this Day, makes mention of His Name.

Thou shall love the LORD thy GOD with all thine Heart, with all thy Soul, with
all thy Might, and with all thy Strength, and thy Neighbor as thy self.


Published for the Weal and Benefit of all Professing Christianity, or that are
the Disciples of JESUS, that Just, and Holy ONE. By One that Mourns for the
Iniquity of the Greatest and Highest Professors, as well as for the Profane.
