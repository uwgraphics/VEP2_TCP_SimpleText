A View of the WORLD; Being A Poem of the Times.
Containing, The Root of Rebellion, the Tree of Sedition, the Leaves of
Contention, and the Fruit of Treason.
^dvising every Good Christian to Obey Governors and Superiors, and not to
Kick at every Occasion; nor to make a Scism and Rent in the Church at every
Scruple, Criticism, and Mistake, but to Live in Peace and Unity; l^st (being
found Impostors before GOD, and Rebels to their KING) their Heads be mounted on
a Pole, as the Fruit of their Treachery and Rebellion.

U^tin a semper exp^cta^ da dies, ^omi^^ d^^ique bea^us ante obitem nemo
Supremaque Funera debet.
Tem ^^a res agiter proximu^ cum paries ardet,
Religio velum est quod tegit omne Scelus.
WAR. BLOODSHED.
VIOLENCE. OPPRESSION.
DESTRUCTION RUIN.
REBELLION-SCISM-SEDITION


THe (...) did Flame, but not Consume,
But th^^ ^ad TREE would waste all (...);
This (...) to Disc^rd, by the (...),
But this brought Peace, for God (...) was chare.
Ambition gave the (...) which did F^^lare,
And made poor (...) to the Grace
Pride (...)
Which bred Cerruption and Mortality:
REBELLION was the Branch that first did spring,
And brought forth TREASON against the A^m^gh^y KING:
It is like Wach Crast, Heinous, and a Sore
Which Amputation only can Restore.
It Is Grief to see (yet no Man does Condole)
A Tra^^^r's Head Erected on a Pole.
G^n^r^h's Grape^ were never half so Sour
As this sad Fruit that is Ripe in half an hour.
Truth is a P^^^l of price which now does lie
Under the (...) of H^p cres^^:
Religion's wrape a Black, and hangs her Head,
As Head were ^l^k, and P^ty were Dead:
It is ^e^ and the Power of E^^reisin,
To disp (...) the Church of Sect and Schism.
False Christ's are many, Faith now Cold is grown;
In here, (...) there, and yet the true's but one.
Here M^l^met's Musty Handeth like a Swine,
Swelled up in Lust, alcho^ he Drinks no Wine.
Turks are but Bruits, their Manners are the same,
They Are dis^^^ced only by the N^ane.
JACK. with his Prick-(...), Preshiters does tickle:
"The (...) ^^^ven is (...) a ( ^ee^icle:
"This is the ^^ay, or (...) Holy Ladder,
"(...) up^ and be (...) the Snake or Adder,
"(...), ^^^hearted, nor be in the least
"(...) the (...) man Beast;
"(...) Reason, Sense, and Law,
"The (...) Scienria Media.
"The (...) was the only Man
"(...) the Truth since ^eresie begin:
"(...) most Mortals did pass by,
"(...) to all Eternity.
"(...) Decreed before the World begin,
"(...) respec^ to the Works of any Man.
"Then comes the QUAKER Preaching "O dear People,
"Fear that Whores House whose Chimney is a Steeple.
"They Are Priests of Baal, Hirelings, always Fleeting,
"But we have silent thoughts; and sweet Dum^^ Meetings.
" Paul was a simple Ignorant Divine,
"In bidding People ear up Bread and Wi^^^
"And all the Aposiles Words were but like ^lakling,
"To vex the World so much with Baby Spr^^^^^,
"Ti^h-taking P^^^t is but an H.retick,
"Though Ab^^^^ pay^^ s^thes to Melthesedick.
"The Bible-Book is but a Lifeless Letter,
"And any Preaching Sister can Write better;
"For (though the Scriptures Sense) the Style is Antic.
"'It Is Old, and Dead, the Apocalyps^ Rom^^^tick.
"No Babylon's without The Man of Sin
"Sits in the heart, and Sodom larks within.
"There Is Gold and Silver, Marble, precious Stone,
"With Souls of Men, and Merchants many a one.
"There Is Purple, Pearl, fine Linen, Silk and Sea^ler,
"With all the Gaudy Dress that sits an Harlet.
"There Is Wine and Oil, fat Beasts, Sheep, Horses, Flywer
"To fill the Cup up of the Scarlet Whore.
"Ah! Sodom, Sodom, Sci^^^ce in the Heart,
"Branching thy Towers and Streets through every part
"Of this my Body, though it be of Clay,
"Pure, Holy, Harmless, Spotless every way.
"Last Night I met a Lovesick Lamb, dear Sister,
"I hugged her in the Dark, and sweetly Kissed her:
"But had our Conflict been seen by the Ungodly,
"Profane, Base, Wicked, they had spoken odly.
"They do not know the Motion that does move
"Us to the Fact, that is not in Lust, but Love.
"Sigh, Cheat, and Lie, work any kind of Sin,
"Do what thou will, and mind the thing within,
"We are the People of God, the rest are Evil,
"Ungodly Goats, and Monsters of the Devil:
"The Holy Words of Thee and Thou, can prove
"That were the Spouse, and only Spotless Dove.
Then Maggleton the Mountebank Divine,
Draws out in Chalk a Querpo Cut or Line,
Wherein all People needs must Walk, or be
Condemned (by him) to all Eternity.
Great, Good, and Just, the World thou made, and thou
Know what it is, and what it will come too:
Without the sight of thy All-seeing Eye,
The smallest Lark, or Sparrow, does not Dye.
Turn all things Lord (even for thine own Sons Blood)
To thine own Glory, and thy Peoples Good.
Let Faith increase, and let thy Gospel Shine,
From East to West, and to Earth's utmost Line.
