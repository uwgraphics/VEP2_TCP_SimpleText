glory of Christ. Yet is this poor woman in Britain, crying, traveling in
birth, pained while she be delivered, because of the Idolatry of the Land, and
our defection and apostasy practiced, countenanced, tolerated in both
Kingdoms. Many graves, many Widows, and the Land turned into a field of blood
are the just fruits of many Altars, of Masse-idolls, of Bread worship, of many
inventions of men, let then: have a name and flourish in the House of the Lord,
and let them be written with the living in Jerusalem who contribute help for
the desired birth of the manchild. Prelacy and Popery wither, as in a Land of
drought, except they be planted beside Rivers of blood; but the Lord shall
build his own Jerusalem.

Your honor may justly challenge this little expression of my obliged respects
to your Lordship. I acknowledge it is little, though it may have some use.

Jmpotency to pay debt lays not upon any the note of unthankfulness, except
it be impotency of good will. If I be not a debtor for will, I am nothing. And
this I owe, and this Church and Nation may divide the sum with me; for which,
wishing to your Lordship all riches of Grace, I stand obliged.

To the Reader.
THere be two happy things (worthy Reader) as Cassian. de incar. lib. 1. c. 4.
Primum est errores penitus non in curr^rc, sec^ndum been repudiare.
one says, The one is not to err, the other is to escape from the power of
error. Times womb brings forth many truths, though truth be not a debtor to
Time, because Time puts new robes on old Truth; But truth is Gods debtor,
and owes her being to him only. It is a great evil under the Sun, and the
sickness of man's vanity, that the name of holy men should be a web to make
garments of for new opinions, but the errors of holy men have no whiteness,
nor holiness from men. And it is a wrong that men's praise should be truths
prejudice, and men's gain, truths loss. Yet I shall heartily desire that men
herein observe the art of deep providence, for the Creator commands darkness
to bring forth her birth of light, and God does so over-aw, with a wise
super-dominion, men's errors, that contrary to natures way, from collision of
opinions, resulteth truth; and disputes, as stricken flint, cast fire for
light, God raising out of the dust and ashes of errors a new living truth. What
mistakes, errors, or heresies have been anent Church government, that vigilant
and never slumbering wisdom of Providence, has thence made to appear the
sound doctrine of Gods Kingdom. So here Satan shapeth, and God seweth, and
makes the garment. Error is but dregs, by the artifice of all compassing
Providence, from whence are distilled strong and cordial waters. And what
Antichrist has conceived for a Hierarchy and humane ceremonies, has put
Christ in his two witnesses in Britain to advocate for the truth and native
simplicity of his own Kingdom.

But I heartily desire not to appear as an adversary to the holy, reverend,
and learned Brethren who are sufferers for the truth, for there be wide marches
betwixt striving, and disputing. Why should we strive? for we be Brethren, the
Sons of one father, the borne Citizens of one mother Jerusalem. To dispute is
not to contend. We strive as we are carnal, we dispute as we are men, we war
from our lusts James 4. 1.
we dispute from diversity of starlight, and daylight. Weakness is not
wickedness, a roving of wit must not be deemed a Rebellion of will, a broken
inginne may part with a dead child, and yet be a Mother of many healthy
children. And while our reverend and dear Brethren, fleeing the coast of
Egypt, and Babylons wicked borders, aim to shore upon truth, wind may deceive
good Sailors, natural land-motions (as when heavy bodies move downward, toward
their own (clay Country) are upon a straight line. But Seamotions of sailing
are not by right lines, but rather by Sea-circles. We often argue and dispute,
as we sail. Where grace and weight of Scripture make motion, we walk, in a
right line, toward God. But where opinion, a messenger only sent to spy the
Land of lies, and truth, usurpeth to conduct us, what marvel then we go about
truth, rather then lodge with Truth. And Christ his Kingdom, Scepter, Glory,
Babylons fall, be the material object of opinions, on both sides; And yet the
word of God has a right lith, that cannot suffer division. In Gods matters
there be not, as in Grammar, the positive and comparative degrees, there are
not here, truth, and more true, and most true. Truth is in an indivisible line,
which has no latitude, and cannot admit of spleeting. And therefore we may
make use of the Philosophers word, amicus Socrates, amicus Plato, sed magis
amica veritas. Though Peter and Paul be our beloved friends, yet the truth is
a dearer friend: The Sons of Babylon make outcries of divisions and
diversity of Religions amongst us, but every opinion is not a new Religion.

But where shall multitude of Gods be had, for multitude of new ways to
Heaven, if one Heaven cannot contain two Gods, how shall all Papists be lodged
after death? what Astronomy shall teach us of millions of Heavens, for
Thomists, Scotists, Franciscans, Dominicans, Sorbonists? etc.

But I leave off, and beg from the Reader candor and ingenuous and fair
dealing, from Formalists, men in the way to Babylon, I may wish this, I cannot
hope it. Farewell.

Yours in the Lord, S. R.

THE Way of the Church of Christ In NEW ENGLAND, Measured by the Golden Reed of
the SANCTUARY. Or,
The way of Churches walking in brotherly equality and independence, or
coordination without subjection of one Church to another, examined and measured
by the Golden Reed of the Sanctuary.
Propositions concerning the supposed visibility and Constitution of
independent Churches, examined.
CHAP. 1. SECT. 1. PROP. 1.
THe Church which Christ in his Gospel has instituted, The way of the
Churches.
and to which he has committed the keys of his Kingdom, the power of binding
and loosing, the Tables and Scales of the Covenant, the Officers and Consures
of his Church, the Administration of all his public worship and Ordinances,
is, coetus fidelium, a company of Believers, meeting in one place, every Lords
day, for the administration of the holy ordinances of God to public
edification. 1 Cor. 14. 23. 1 Because it was a company whereof Peter confessing
and believing was one, and built on a rock, Mat. 16. 18. a Such as unto whom
any offended brother might complain, Mat. 18. 17. 3 Such as is, to cast out
the incestuous* Corinthian, 1 Cor. 5. Which cannot agree to any diocesian,
provincial, or National assembly.

Ans. From these we question.

Quest. 1. If a company of believers and saints builded by faith, upon the rock
Christ, and united in a Church Covenant, be the only instituted visible Church
of the New Testament, to the which Christ has given the keys:

Let these considerations be weighed.

1. Did. The matter of an instituted visible Church is one thing, and the
instituted visible Church is another, as there be ods betwixt stones and
timber, and an house made of stones and timber.

2 Did. It is one thing to govern the actions of the Church and another thing
to govern the Church, the Moderator of any Synod, does govern the actions of
the Synod, but he is not for that a Governor, Ruler, and Pastor of the Synod.
Or, ordering actions, and governing men are diverse things.

3. Did. A thing has first its constituted and accomplished being in matter,
form, efficient and final causes, before it can perform these operations and
actions that flow from that being so constituted, a Church must be a Church,
before any Ministerial Church actions can be performed by it.

4. Did. It is one thing for a company to perform the actions of a Church
mystical and redeemed of Christ, and another thing to perform actions
ministerial of a Church instituted and ministerial.

1. Concl. A company of believers professing the truth is the matter of the
Church, though they be saints by calling and builded on the rock, yet are they
but to the Church instituted, Trelcat. loc. 16. a^t. ^. Tylen. Syntag. disp.
14. de Eccl.
as stones to the house. 2. Because they cannot perform the actions of a
constituted Church, till they be a constituted Church. 3. Our Divines call men
externally called, the matter of the visible Church, so Trelcatius, Tilenu^,
professors dis. 1. These. 19. Profess. leyd. synop pur. Theol. dis. 4. these. 34.

of Leyden; Piscator, Bucanus, so say our brethern.

2. Council. Ordination of Pastors, and election of Officers, administration of
the seals of grace, and acts of Church censures, are holden by Gods Word, and
by all our Divines, actions of a ministerial and an instituted visible Church,
and if so, according to our third distinction.

It is a wonder how a company of Believers united in Church Covenant, cannot
perform all these, for they are Answer to Quest. 2.
united, and so a perfect Church, and yet cannot administrate the Sacraments:
for though they be so united, they may want Pastors, who only can perform
these actions, as this Way of the Church. Chapter Sect, compare with. chap. 2.

Robins. Justify. page 106.

Confess. Separ. art. 37.


Treatise says, and Robinson and the Confession. And it is no less wonder
that Officers and Rulers who are to feed, and govern the Flock, are but only
accidents and not parts, not integrall members of a constituted Church: no
perfect Corporation makes its own integrall parts or members, a perfect
living man does not make his own Hands, Feet, or Eyes, the man is not a
perfect one in all his members, if all the members be not made with him; but
Officers by preaching make Church Members.

3. Concl. The visible Church which Christ instituted in the Gospel is not
formally a company of believers meeting, for public edification, by common and
joint consent, as this Author says. 1. The instituted Church of the New
Testament is an organicall body of diverse members, of eyes, ears, feet,
hands, of Elders governing, and a people governed. 1 Cor. 12. 14, 15. Romans 12.
4, 5, 6. Act. 20. 28.

But a company of believers, meeting for public edification by common consent,
are not formally such a body; for they are a body not Organicall, but all of
one and the same nature, all believers and saints by calling, and are not a
body of Officers governing, and people governed; for they are, as they are a
visible Church, a single uncompounded body, wanting Officers, and are as yet to
choose their Officers: and all thus combined are not Officers, Romans 10. 14. How
shall they preach except they be sent? 1 Cor. 12. 29. Are all Apostles? are all
Prophets? we justly censure the Papists, and amongst them, Bellarmine, who will
scarce admit an essential Church of believers, but acknowledges other three
Churches beside, to wit, a representative Church of their Clergy only,
excluding the Laickes Bell de Eccl. li. 3 cap. 2.
(as they call them) 2 A consistoriall Church of Cardinals. 3. A virtuall
Church, the Pope who has plenitude of all power in himself, against which our
writers Calvin, Beza, Tilenus, Iunius, Bucanus, professors of Leyden,
Whittaker, willet do dispute; so the other extremity can hardly be maintained,
that there is an instituted, visible, ministerial Church to which Christ has
given the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, exercising Church actions, as to
ordain, and make and un-make Officers and Rulers without any officer at all.
The major of our proposition is grantted by our brethren, who cite, 1 Cor. 12.
Romans 12. Acts 20. 28. To prove a single Congregation to be the only visible
Church instituted in the New Testament. Nothing can be said against this, but a
Church of Governors and People governed is an instituted visible Church; but
there is an instituted visible Church before there be Governors, but such an
instituted Church we cannot read of in Gods Word, which does and may exercise
Church acts of government without any Officers at all.

2. That company cannot be the Church ministerial instituted by Christ in the
New Testament, which cannot meet all of them, every Lords day, as the Church
of Corinth did for administration of the holy Ordinances of God, and all his
Ordinances to public edification; for so this Author describes a visible
instituted Church, 1 Cor. 14. 23. But a company of believers meeting for
public edification, by joint and common consent cannot meet for the public
administration of all the Ordinances of God, 1. They cannot administer the
seals of the Covenant being destitute of the Officers, as the Scripture, and
their confession says, 2. They cannot have the power of public edification,
being destitute of Pastors, because the end cannot be attained without the 1
Cor. 11. 23. Mat. 28. 19.

1 Cor. 1. 17. Confess. art. 37.


means appointed of Christ. But Christ for public edification and Church
edification has given Pastors, Teacher^ and other Officers to his Church Ephesians.
4. 11. 1 Timothy 5. 17. I^ is not enough to say, that such a company meeting has
power of Pastoral preaching and administration of the Seals of grace, because
they may ordain and elect Officers, for such public edification, but 1. we
prove, that that which our brethren call the only instituted visible Church of
the New Testament, has not power to administrate all the Ordinances of Christ,
and how then are they a Church? can we call him a perfect living man, who
cannot exercise all the vital actions, which flow from the nature and essence
of a living man? 2. If this be a good reason that such a company should be the
only instituted Church in the New Testament having power of all the Ordinances,
because they may appoint Officers, who have such a power; then any ten
believers, who have never sworn the Church Covenant, meeting in private to
exhort one another is also the only instituted Church ministerial, in the New
Testament, for they have power to make such Officers, and may invest themselves
in right, to all the Ordinances of Christ, by our brothers Doctrine, 3. All the
places cited by the Author, speak of a Church visible made up of, Officers
governing, and people governed and as Mat. 16. Mat 18. cannot exclude Pastors
who bind on Earth, and in heaven, or Pastors who are stewards, and bear the
keys, as hereafter, I shall prove. Also the Church of Corinth did meet for
the administration of the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11. 20. and so were a Church of
Officers and governed people, they met with Paul's spirit, and the authority of
Pastors. 1 Cor. 5. 4. another Church that exercised Discipline, as Collosse
Col. 2. 8. was a Church of Officers and people Col. 4. 17. Philippi consisted
of Saints, Bishops, and Deacons. Phil. 1. 1. 2. Ephesus of a flock, and an
eldership, Acts 20. 28. so the visible ministerial Church that the word of God
speaks of, as all the seven Churches of Asia and their Angels, had in them
Officers to govern, and people governed, and therefore they were not a number
of sole. believers united in a Church Covenant, which in very deed i^ but
stones and timber, not an house builded of God; for in the ministerial Church
of the New Testament, there is e^e^ a relation betwixt the Elders and the
flock: we desire to to see a Copy of our brethrens instituted visible Church,
to the which Elders are neither essential, nor integrall parts, for their
instituted visible Church has its complete being and all its
Church-operations, as binding, loosing, ordeining of Officers, before there be
an Edldership in it, and also when the Eldership is ordained, they are not Eyes
and Ears to the instituted Church, nor watchmen, because it is a body in
essence and operation complete without officers. 2. the officers are not
Governors, for as I trust to prove, they have no act of ministerial authority
of governing; over the people by our brethrens Doctrine, 2. all their governing
is to Rule and moderate the actions of the whole governing Church, which makes
them no ways to be governors, nor over the believers in the Lord, nor
overseers, nor watchmen: as a Preses who moderateth a Judicatorie, a moderator
in a Church-meeting, a Prolocutor in a convocation, is not over the
Judicatorie, Synod, or meeting, or Convocation. 3. The Eldership are called by
them, the adjuncts, the Church, the subject: the subject has its perfect
essence without its accidents and common adjuncts.

2 Quest. Whether or not Christ has committed the Keys of the Quest. 2.
Kingdom of Heaven, to the Church of Believers, which as yet wants all
Officers, Pastors, Doctors, etc.

The Author says, this company of believers and Church which wants Officers,
and (as we have heard) is complete without them, is the corporation to which
Christ has given the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; which deserves our
brotherly censure: for we then ask a Scripture for the Lords giving of the
keys to Pastors and Elders; if the keys be given to Peter, Mat. 16. as a
professing believer, by what Word of God are they given to Peter, as to an
Apostle and Pastor, it would seem the Pastors have not the keys jure Divino;
for by this argument our Divines prove the Bishop not to be an Office of power
and jurisdiction above a Pastor and Presbyter, because the keys were not given
to Peter as to the Archbishop, but as to a Pastor of the Church, and indeed
this would conclude that Pastors are not Officers of authority and power of
jurisdiction, jure Divino.

Hence the question is, if it can be concluded that the keys of of the Kingdom
of Heaven, Mat. 16. Mat. 18. were given to Peter, as he represented all
professing believers, or if they were given for the good of professing
believers, but to Peter as carrying the person of Apostles, Pastors, and
Church-guides?

1. Distinction, There is one question of the power of the keys, and to whom
they are committed, and another of the exercise of them, and touches the
government of the Church, if it be popular and democraticall or not?

2. Did. It is not inconvenient, but necessary that Christ should give to his
Church, gifts, Pastors and Teachers, of the which gifts the Church is not
capable, as a subject as if the Church might exercise the Pastor and Doctors
place: and yet the Church is capable of these gifts, as the object, and end,
because the fruit and effect of these gifts redoundeth to the good of the
Church, see Parker de po^it. Eccl. l. 3. c. 8.
Parker, see the C^hol. Paris. page 8.
Parisian school and Paul Baynes docesart tyrall. 3. q. concl. 3. pa. 83.
Bayner.

3. Distinct. There is a formal ordinary power, and there is a vertuall or
extraordinary power.

1. Concl. Christ Jesus has immediately himself without the intervening power
of the Church or men, appointed offices and Officers in his house, and the
office of a pastor, and Elder is no less immediately From Christ (for men as
Christ's Vicars and Instruments can appoint no new Office in the Church) then
the office of the Apostles, Ephesians. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Mat. 28. 19. The Offices
are all given to the Church immediately, and so absolutely, and so the power of
the keys, is given to the Church the same way. But the Officers, and key
bearers now are given mediatly, and conditionally, by the intervening mediation
of the ruling and ministerial Church, that she shall call such and such, as
have the conditions required to the office by Gods Word, 1. Tim. 3. 12, 3.
Hence we see no reason, why the keys can be said to be given to believers, any
other ways, then that they are given for their good.

2. Concl. I deny not, but there is a power virtuall, not formal in the Church
of believers, to supply the want of ordination of pastors, or some other acts
of the keys simply necessary, hic and nunc; this power is virtuall, not
formal, and extraordinary not ordinary, not official, not properly
authoritative, as in a Church in an Island, where the pastors are dead, or taken
away by pest or otherwise, the people may ordain Pastors or rather do that
which may supply the defect of ordination, as David without immediate
Revelation, from Heaven to direct him, by only the Law of nature, did eat
shewbread; so is the case here, so answer the casuistes and the schoolmen,
that a positive Law may yield in case of necessity, to the good of the Church;

as Theodo. l. 4. ca. 14. c. 24.
Theodoret says; yea, says Voetius, an ordinary ministry might be imposed on
a Laick, or private person by the Church, though the presbytery consent not, in
case of necessity. God ( says Gerson par. 2. Sermon Rhen. dom. 2. postpashat
Gerson) may make an immediate intermission of a calling by Bishops; yea (
says Anton. 3. l. 3. c. 83.
Anton. speaking of necessities Law) The Pope may commit power of
Excommunication, quia est de jure positive, pure Laico and mulieri, to one
mere Laicke, or a woman; though we justify not this, yet it is hence
concluded that God has not tied himself to one set rule of ordinary, positive
Laws: a captive woman (as Socrates says) preached the Gospel to the King and
Queen of Iberranes, and they to the people of the Land.

3. Concl. The Author in the foresaid first proposition, will have no
instituted visible Church, in the New Testament, but a Congregationall or
Parishionall Church, that meets together ordinarily, in one place, for the
hearing of the Word. But we think, as a reasonable man is the first, immediate
and principal subject of aptitude to laugh, and the mediate and secondary
Subjects are, Peter, John and particular men, so that it is the intention of
nature to give these and the like properties, principally and immediately, to
the speci^e, and common nature, and not immediately to this or that man; so are
the blessings of the promises, as to be builded on a Rock; victory over hell,
and such, given principally and immediately to the Catholic and invisible
Church, as to the first and principal subject; and no ways to a visible
Congregation consisting of 30 or 40. professing the Faith of Christ: but only
to them, not as Professors, but to them as they are parts and living members of
the true Catholic Church. For sound professors, though united in a
Church Covenant, are indeed the mystical Church, but not as professors, but as
sound believers, and therefore these of whom Christ speaks, Mat. 16. Are
builded on a Rock, as true believers; but the keys are given not to them, but
for them, and for their good, as professors making Peter's confession, and in
Gods purpose to gather them into Christ. But the Text evinceth that these keys
are given to Peter, as representing the Church-guides especially, though not
excluding believers, giving to them popular consent, and not to Believers, as
united in a company of persons in Church Covenant, excluding the Elders.

1. To that Church are the keys given, which is builded on the rock as a house,
the house of wisdom, Prove. 9. 1. The house of God, 1 Timothy 3. 15. Heb. 3. 4. By
the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, by Doctors and Teachers, whom Christ
has given, for the building of his house, Ephesians. 4. 11. But this house is not a
company of professing believers united by a Church Covenant and destitute of
Pastors and Teachers, but a Church edified by the Word, Seals, and Discipline:
Ergo such a Church is not here understood. The propofition is granted by the
Author. I prove the assumption. The Church of believers combined in
Church Covenant, but wanting their Pastors and Teachers, is not wisdoms house,
nor builded by pastors and Doctors given to edify and gather the body, but
they are only the materials of the house: yea wanting the pastors, they want
Ministerial power, for pastoral preaching and administrating the Seals, and
for that, they want the power of edifying the body of Christ, which is required
in a visible Church Ephesians. 4. 11. Though the building of this Church on the Rock
Christ may well be thought to be the inward building of the Catholic and
invisible Church in the Faith of Christ, yet as it is promised to the Church,
to the which Christ promises the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, it can be no
other beside external and Ministerial building by a public Ministry.

2. Arg. To these are the keys here promised, who are stewards of the mysteries
of God, 1 Cor. 4. 1. And servants of the house by office, 2 Cor. 4. 5. And are
by office to open the doors and behave themselves aright in Gods house, 1 Timothy
3. 16. and to divide to these of the house their portion in due season, Mat.
24. 45. and to cut the word, 2 Timothy 2. 15. But a company of professing
believers joined together in a Church Covenant, and destitute of officers, are
not stewards by office, nor servants over the house, etc.

Ergo, to such a company the keys are not here given.

The proposition especially is to be proved (for the assumption is granted by
our brethren and evidently true) but it is sure by the phrase of Scripture,
Esai. 22. 22. And I will lay upon his shouldier the key of the house of David.

Pareus on the same place. I think, while of late, never interpreter dreamed,
that in the Text, Mat. 16. the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are given to all
believers, but only to the stewards of the house builded upon the Rock.

3. Arg. To these in this Text does Christ give the keys, to whom he gives
warrant, for the actual exercise of the keys, to wit, to bind and loose on
Earth, and so open and shut the doors of the Kingdom. But this warrant and
official authority of binding and loosing, Christ gives to Peter only as
representing Apostles, Teachers and Elders, and not to the Church of believers
convened Covenant-wayes, and destitute of Officers; Ergo, the proportion is
clear in the Text; to the same person, to whom the promises the power or
keys, to the same he promises Official warrant to exercise the special acts
of the keys, but to Peter is the promise of both made 19. and if Christ allude
to the place, Is. 22. 22. Then (I say) these to whom Christ gave the keys, do
by Office represent him who has the keys of David's house and the Government on
his shoulder, And I will give to thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, there
is the power and authority granted; And whatsoever thou shall bind on Earth,
shall be bound in Heaven: there is a warrant, for the exercise of the acts of
the power given also to Peter; Now if the keys be not given to Peter as to a
Pastor; Peter and pastors, by this place, as pastors, neither have the keys,
nor official warrant to preach, and to remit, or retain sins; and if by
this place, they have it not, we desire to see a warrant from Christ, before he
went to heaven, for pastoral preaching Beza. Ministerii Ecclesiastici,
authorit^^ caelestis.
Beza in his marginall notes in this Text, says, here is the Heavenly
authority of the Church Ministry; also binding and loosing is all one, with
opening and shutting Heaven Gates, and with remitting and retaining sins,
Ioh. 20. Papists, I know, deny that the Apostles were made priests judicially
to remit sins before Christ's Resurrection, Ioh, 2. so Tolet comment in Joan.

2. To bind and to loose, are act. s of official power, and of Princes,
Rulers, and Feeders, Ergo they are not given to the Church destitute of Feeders
and Governors. I prove the antecedent. 1. To bind and loose, by all
Interpreters, Augustine, Cyrill, Chrysostom. C^prian, Euthymius, Hyeromi,
Basilus, Ambrose, Sedulius, Primasius, and by our own Calvin, Musculus,
Gualther, Pareus, Beza, Zwinglius, Rolloc, VVhittaker, and the evidence of

Beza, and Calvin comment
Calvin will have them to be words signifying the ^fficiall authority of

3. 37.
is an authoritative act of Princes, Superiors, Governors and Rulers. And so is
lo^sing a judicial and authoritative act of Rulers and Overseers Levit. 14. 7.
Psalm. 102. 20. Jer. 40. 4. Ps. 105. 20. Act. 2. 24. Romans 7. 2. 1 Cor. 7. 27.
Rev. 20. 3. Rev. 9. 15. Job. 12. 18.
as Scripture teaches us. But the Church of believers wanting their Officers,
watchmen, and Overseers, though combined in a Church Covenant, is not a company
of Overseers and Rulers, or judicial and authoritative binders and loosers
exercising power over themselves.

4. Arg. If Christ do not say in this place, nor in Mat. 18. that the keys and
the acts of the keys, to wit, binding and loosing, are given to the Church of
believers, without their Officers; then neither places prove, that the keys
are given to such a Church.

But Christ does not say it; Ergo, the Text cannot bear it: the assumption I
prove. Christ, Mat. 16. 18. speaking of the Church builded on a Rock, says
not, I will give to the Church so builded, the keys; but he turns the speech
to Peter, when he promises the keys V. 19. And I will give to thee, ( Peter,
not to the Church) the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, surely none needs to
teach our Lord to speak. This change of the persons to whom the keys are
promised, wants not a reason. Our brethren say, the promise is made to Peter,
because he gave a confession of Christ in the name of all believers, and
because the keys are given to believers, as the Spouse of Christ, and as his
body united to him: but this author, grants every company of believers,
because they are believers, are not an instituted visible Church, but they must
be a company of believers professing Covenant-wayes Faith in Christ, and
Church Communion. But, 1. then the keys are not given to believers because they
are believers, and the Spouse of Christ, but because they are such professors,
so and so combined in a Church Covenant. But yet I ask, whether true or false
profession be the nearest intervening cause of these, to whom the keys are
given. If a true profession, then. 1. Unbelieving Pastors are not Pastors; for
their profession is not true. And children baptized by them are as
not-baptized, or as baptized by Women, 2. If one shall be excommunicated by
seven (for such Cap. 3. Sect. 1.
a number this Author requires to make a visible Church) even, clave non
errante, and most deservedly, he is not bound in Heaven, and excommunicated, in
foro Dei, before God: for the profession of these seven may be false, and so
the Church acts performed by them, are a non habentibus potestatem, and null,
if they be no Church, 3. We can prove by Scripture Mat. 10. 2. Joh 6. 70. Acts
17. 20. 21.
that Judas though the child of perdition, was a called Apostle. But if a false
profession be sufficient to make persons a true visible Church, the^. 1. The
keys are not given to believers, because they are believers, and united to
Christ, as his body and Spouse, but. 2. This Author says amiss, That the
Church instituted by Christ is a company of believers, and faithful and godly
men, whereof Peter was one; for a company of hypocrites are not such. 2. Our
brethren prove the keys, to be a part of the liberty of the redeemed ones, but
counterfeit professors are not redeemed ones, nor have they that liberty
purchased to them in Christ. 4 It shall follow, that our brethren widely
mistake a supposed difference which they devise, betwixt the Jewish and
Christian Church, to wit, that to make men members of the Jewish Church,
external holiness, as to be borne Jews, was sufficient, and to be
circumcised, and not a bastard, not descended within three or four Generations
of a Moabite, or Ammonite, but that the visible Church of the Gentiles after
Christ must be the bride of Christ, and by true Faith united to him. Whereas
the members of a Christian visible Church are and may be hypocrites, though not
known to be such, as were the members of the Jewish Church. Also Mat. 18 18,
19. Christ changes the persons, v. 17. after he has spoken of the Church v.
17. he shows v. 18. of what Church he speaks, and directs his speech to
these to whom he spoke v. 1. to the Disciples who were Pastors, verily I say
unto you, What soever ye shall bind on Earth, shall be hond in Heaven, and
therefore none can make an argument from, Mat. 16. to wit thus, to as many are
the keys promised, as are builded on the Rock, but all the faithful are
builded on the Rock, Ergo to all the faithful are the keys promised. 1. The
proposition is not in the Text either expressly, or by consequent. 2. The
proposition is false, for the Catholic invisible Church is builded on the
rock, but by our Brethrens confession the keys are not given to the Catholic
invisible Church, but only to such a company of professing believers, as make a
Parishionall Congregation. 4. That Christ speaks to Peter as to one
representing the Apostles, and not as to one representing all believers, is
clear. 1. Because by the confession of our Brethren binding and loosing are
denied to many that make Peter's confession, thou art Jesus the Son of the
living God, as to believing Women and children; and many out of Church. state.
2. If believers as giving Peter's confession, and as builded upon the rock,
Christ, by this place made a ministerial Church, by Christ, and gifted with
the power of the keys, then the Ministry and official power of preaching and
binding and loosing should be made as stable and firm from defection, as the
Church of elect believers, against whom the gates of hell cannot prevail: now
besides that this is most untrue since, visible Churches do fall away, as
these seven Churches in Asia, the Church of Corinth, Ephesus, Galatia,
Thessalonica may prove, when as it is impossible that the elect Believers in
Christ can fall away, it shall also give good warrant to Papists, to make such
use of this place, as they do, that the Church may err in points of
conversation and life, but cannot fall from the rock, nor be overcome by the
powers of Hell in the definition of Articles of Faith. So Gretser de in Augnr
Doctor Luther. p. ^9.

Gregor. de Valent. Hosius in confess. Polmiea.
Cardi. Hosius Joan. de Turre cremat. de Gal. l. 1. ca. 24, 25, 26.
Turrecremata, reason from this place; and the connection must be good, if the
Ministerial power not only be given to the Church as to the Object, that is,
for the good and salvation of the Church, but also to the Church as to the
Subject, who has all the power of the Keys, and may use it also, because they
are believers and builded upon the rock Christ; nothing hinders, but
Ministerial power should be as stable and free from being overcome with the
ports of Hell, as the Christian state of perseverance in grace. Now we see,
these who have Ministerial power, abuse it, and fall from the rock and perish
eternally; which we cannot say of these, who by Faith are builded upon the Rock
Christ Jesus. 3. These to whom Christ gives the Keys, do represent the person
of Christ, and who despises them despises Christ, and he that honors them,
honors Christ, which is evidently spoken of the Ministers of Christ, Matthew
10. 40. And is said here Matthew, 16. 19. Whatsoever then ye shall bind on
Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, etc. Thus Christ binds and loses in
Heaven, when these to whom the Keys are given, bind and loose; and so they are
to be looked unto as co-workers with God. Now Scripture never makes all
believers Ambassadors in Christ's room. Where do we read that the despising
of all believers commanding in Christ's Name, is a despising of Christ, and that
in obeying them, we obey Christ? Nor are all Ambassadors, Pastores, etc. 5.
These to whom the Keys are given do authoritatively forgive and retain sins,
and their acts of forgiveing and retaining are valid in Heaven, according as
the party repents and believes, or according as they remain impenitent, as
our Divines teach against the Papists, in their Doctrine of Sacramental
absolution. But the Church, or company of believers wanting their Officers, by
no Scripture can authoritatively forgive, and retain si^s. Robinson, Smith and
others answer, that believers out of Office may forgive, as Mat. 18. 21. Peter
said, How often shall my brother offend me, and I forgive him? Lu. 17. 3. 4. 2
Cor. 2. 10.

But I answer, the place, 2 Cor. 2. 10. is controverted, and we doubt not, but
of that same nature, with the power of Excommunicating. 1 Cor. 5. 4. But for
private forgiving, it is not the Church-forgiving here meant, because 1. The
private forgiving is a duty of charity commanded in the Law of Nature to all,
even out of Church State, and obliges the Excommunicate, who, though they be
cast out of the Church, are not exempted from the Law, that binds all, Mat.
6. 12. 14, 15. Mat. 5. 44. 45. but the Church-forgiving is an Act of obedience
to a positive Church-Law of Christ, 2. private Christians are to forgive their
Enemies whether they repent, or not, even as Christ forgave those who crucified
him, Col 3. 13. Luke 23. 34. and when the party repents not, this
forgiveness is not ratified in Heaven, yet are we obliged to forgive, and to
commit vengeance to God; but the authoritative forgiveing is a thing that the
Church, is not obliged unto, absoiutely; nor may they, or can they forgive,
except the Offender repent: and if they see that he repents not, they cannot
lawfully forgive; but, being in Gods room, must take vengeance on all
disobedience, and their retaining of sin and forgiveing, is valid in Heaven,
because they are in Gods place. Now any forgiving or retaining of sin but these
two, together with Gods forgiving and retaining, we know not. But Peter's
forgiving his offending brother seventy times seven times, is common to all
private Christians, even out of Church State, and so the instance given is not
to the purpose, 6. To these only are the Keys given, who having Paul's pastoral
spirit, may convene and deliver to Satan, but the Church of believers without
Officers, not having Paul's pastoral spirit which is a spirit official, and
authoritative to preach, excommunicate, and administrate the seals of the
Covenant, may not convene and do this; Ergo, etc. indeed Fran. Johnson art. 5.
in M. Clisions book. p. 29.
Francis Johnson says it is holden now by some of the Separation, that people
out of Office may execute all the works and duties of the ministry, in
Baptism, the Lords Supper, censures, etc. which I think follows from the
grounds of our brethren, to wit, that believers without Office are a complete
Church, having the whole power of the Keys: if administration of the Sacraments
be not a special part of the Keys, and the opening of Heaven and forgiving of
sins, we know not what belongs to the power of binding and loosing; yea this
is not only contrary to Scripture Mat. 18. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 23. 1 Cor. 1. 17.

signifies not the multitude, Pareus, Apostolis dict manisestum est, quicquid
vos Apostoli ligaveritis, ut supra Petro dixerat Christus, Mat. 16. 19.
Parcus also is most clear on this place Calvin com. ib.
Calvin has reason to say, he alludeth to Jewish Synedrie, Joh. Weemes vol. 3.
expos. of the judicial Law. c. 16.
see also VVeems. I^ it needless to cite Iunius, Zanchius, Peter Martyr,
Willet, Whittaker, Tilen, Becan, and all our Divines of the reformed Churches;
for when he has spoken of the Church representative, Mat. 18. 16, 17. and
speaks to these, to whom the Sermon was made, v. 1. at the same time came the
Disciples to Jesus (they were then Apostles in Office and called to preach and
Baptize, though not yet sent to the whole world) saying who is the greatest in
the Kingdom of God? Now to these Christ says, 18. to the Apostles, Verily I
say to you, whatsoever you shall bind on Earth; and this place is to be
expounded by Mat. 16. 19. Where the Keys are given in a more restricted manner
to Peter only, though as representing the whole Apostles and Church-rulers, and
we have better reason to expound this place, Mat. 18. by the place foregoing,
Mat. 16. then they have to expound the place, Mat. 16. by this place, Mat. 18.
because these ^am^ Keys that bind and loose in the one place, remit and
retain finnes, in the other; and we find the keys given to Officers and
Stewards only. And here is no Church, Mat. 18. or yet Mat. 16. without Pastors,
except they say, that Christ Mat. 18. 18. speaks not to the Disciples, but to
the multitude of the Jews, which is a great crossing of the Text. And to say,
that Christ speaks to the Apostles, not as to Apostles, but as to the Church
of believers, is only a bare affertion, and cannot be proved, and all they can
say, hangs upon this one place, and this is the most. The power of binding
and loosing is given to the Church, which is to be obeyed and heard in the
place of God. But this Church, is never in the Word of God ( say they) taken
for a company of Officers, Pastors, and Elders only; it signifies always the
Body of Christ, his Spouse, his Saints by calling, partakers of the most holy
Faith. To which I answer, The body, Spouse of Christ, and Saints by calling, as
they are such, is the invisible Church, and the keys and Seals Way of the
Church of n. E. c. 4. sec. 5.
says this Author) are not to be dispensed to all the faithful as such, but
as they are confederate or joined together in some particular visible Church,
that is, says he) as they are members of a visible Church; Ergo, etc. the body
and Spouse of Christ, as such, is not the Church here meant of, but the visible
Congregation. Now the essence of a visible Church of which Christ speaks
here, is saved in ten, who are only visible professors, and not a Church of
sound Believers, not the true body mystical and Spouse of Christ: and yet, by
this place, the Keys are given to such a Church; now we desire again, a
place, in all Gods Word, for a Church in this sense, and a Body of Christ and
his Spouse in this meaning: for certainly, professors this way confederate, as
professiors, are no more a Church of Christ, redeemed ones, and his Spouse,
then an Assembly of Elders only can be called such a Church of Believers; for
both Churches are, and may be; where no believers are at all, at least for a
time, and even while they exercise this power of Binding and Loosing, and so
the place, Matthew 18. is as much against our brethren, as against us.

And Lastly our Doctrine is acknowledged, by all our Divines, against the
Papists, proving that Mat. 16. the Keys were given to Peter as representing
the Apostles, and his successors in the pastoral charge, not as representing
all believers. Irenaus i^ qui in Ecclesia sunt, Presbyteris obed^ oportet, iis

CHAP. 2. SECT. 2. PROP.
THis Church ( says the Author) does meet together every Lords Day, all of
them, even the whole Church, for administration of the Ordinances of God, to
public edification.

Ans. Two things are here said, 1. That all, even the whole Church, must meet
for administration of the Ordinances of God, that so all and every one of the
Church may be actors and Judges in dispensing of censures, this we take to be
popular government. 2. That there is a necessity of personal presence of all
and every one of the Church* Hence

Quest. 3. Whether or no the multitude of Believers, and the whole people are
to be judges, so, as private Christians out of Office are to exercise judicial
acts of the keys?

For the more easy clearing of the Question, let it be observed.

1. Did. There is a dominion of Government Lordly and Kingly, and this is in
Christ only in relation to his Church and in civil judges, and is no ways in
Church- guides, who are not Lords over the Lords inheritance; there is a
government Ministerial, of service, under Christ, and this is due to
Church-guides.

2. Did. Regal power, being a civil power founded in the Law of nature ( for
the Ants have a King) may well be in the people originally and subjectively, as
in the fountain, nature teaching every community to govern themselves, and to
hold off injuries, if not by themselves, yet by a King, or some selected
Rulers; but power of Church Government being supernatural, and the acts of
Church Government, and of the casting such as offend out of Christ's Kingdom,
being supernatural, neither of them can be originally in the multitude of
professing believers, but must be communicated by Christ to some certain
professing believers, and these are Officers. Therefore to put power and acts
of government in all professors, is a natural way drawn from civil
incorporations. Christ is not ruled by our Laws.

3. Did. The government of Christ's Kingdom is the most free and willing
government on earth; yet it is a government properly so called, for there be in
it authoritative commandments, and Ecclefiasticke coaction, upon the danger of
soul penalties; in regard of the former, all the people by consent and
voluntary agreement have hand in election of Officers, inflicting of censures,
because it concerns them all: but in regard of the latter, the whole people
are not over the whole people; they are not all Kings reigning in Christ's
government over Kings, but are divided into governors and governed; and
therefore the rulers Ecclesiasticke only, by power of office, are in Christ's
room, over the Church, to command, sentence, judge, and judicially to censure.

4. Distinct. The Official power of governing superaddeth to the simple acts
of popular consenting, the official authoritative and coactive power of
Christ's Sceptor in discipline.

That distinction in the sense holden by our brethren Presbytetiall government
examined, p. 23.
that the state of the Church is popular, and the government Aristocraticall in
the hands of the Eldership, is no ways to he holden; nor do the Parisian
Doct. Parisiens. de polit. Eccles. page 10, 11.
Doctors, the authors of this distinction, mind any Church Government to be in
the people.

Our brethren in the answer to the questions sent to them from England,
explain their mind thus: 1. We acknowledge a Presbytery, whose work it is to
teach and rule, and whom the people ought Quest 15.
to obey, and we condemn a mere popular government, such as our writers
condemn in Morellius. They add*

Government merely Aristocraticall, where all authority is in the hands of the
Eldership, excluding the people from intermedling by way of power, we conceive
to be without warrant and injurious to the people, infringing their liberties
in choosing Officers, admitting members, censuring offenders, even Ministers,
Col. 4. 16.

To which doctrine we oppose these conclusions:

1. Concl. Our brethren hold a mere popular government, with Morellius. 1.
Because nothing is left peculiar in government to the Officers which all the
people have not. 2. Because a greater power of Church-Jurisdiction, as I shall
prove, is given to the people then to the guides; for, cursing by
Excommunication of all the Officers, and blessing of them by pardoning their
faults, and admitting of Members and laying on of hands, is the greatest power
that can be given to people. But this and many other acts of jurisdiction the
people have by our brethrens Doctrine. 3. The people is no more obedient to the
Eldership, in teaching, then Indians and Infidels, who are hearers of the word,
and are under an obligation to obey the word; and under the very same
obligation of an Evangelicke offer made to all: The people (say they) are under
the obligation of obedience to Pastoral teaching, under the pain of Church
censures, but so are not Indians, who may be only hearers, but are in no
Church Membership. I answer, Obligation to Church censures from the Pastors, as
Pastors, lies not on the people, by our brethrens doctrine. 1. Because
Pastors, as Pastors, are not the Church builded on the rock, nor the Spouse of
Christ, nor any part thereof; nor any part of the visible Church, to the which
Christ has given the Keys: for the visible Church is a complete Church in
esse, and in operari, in their being and Church actions of a visible Church
without all Pastors of any Officers, as they teach. 2. Because Pastors are
only parts of the visible Church, as believers, and so have the power of the
Keys as believers; and this the believers have, which the Pastors have not;
and so seeing the Pastors as Pastors have not the Keys, nor can they use the
Keys, or excommunicate as parts or members of the visible Church; because, as
Pastors, they are neither parts nor members of the Church, but adjuncts, and
mere accidents of the visible Church, and therefore the people are under no
obligation of obedience to Pastors, as Pastors under pain of Ecclesiasticke
censures, more then Indians or Infidels, who are their hearers.

2. Concl. Christ has given no warrant at all of actual Church government, to
all the whole visible Church. 1. so the places that I cited before Paul's
Presbytery, c. 6. 63. 64.
Iadde the styles of Official dignity given to Officers, because of their
government, are given only to Officers, and never to the people; Ergo, the
people have no power of government; the consequence is sure, those who are
privileged of Christ to govern, ordinarily should be, and duly are
Governors. But the style of Gods is given to Church-guides, Ioh. 10. 33, 36.
Ioh. 20. 21. which title for governing is given to Judges, Psalm. 82. 6. Exodus
21. 6. And his Master shall bring him (...) to the Judges. Now the people are
not Gods, nor are they (...), Heb. 13. 17. over the people in the Lord. Which
word, no doubt, the Apostle borrowed from the Septuagint, so stiling the
Rulers, not because of their place of preaching only, but of governing also,
as Jos. 13. 21. Micah 3. 9. Ezech. 44. 3. Dan. 3. 2. Acts 23. 24. Matthew. 27. 2.
(...) and it is given to the Kings or supreme rulers, 1 Pet. 2. 14. (...), so
it is frivolous, that they say Church Officers are never called (...): For
these words of official power of government are no less powerful, and never
communicated to any but to Church Officers, such as are (...), watchmen, not
only for preaching, but also for government, Phil. 1. 1. 1 Timothy 3. 2. Acts 20.
28. and the people are not (...), Governors, 1 Cor. 12. 28. nor are they
(...), Romans 12. 8. nor obliged to be (...), Rulers, as they are the visible
Church, nor should they be (...), 1 Timothy 5. 17. nor are they to be (...),
Laborers, and over the Saints in the Lord. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12.

2. If all the people as contradistinguished from Officers, are to watch over
one another, and by office to rebuke, censure, excommunicate, ordain, and
exauthorate Officers, then must they in Conscience attend the judging of all
causes, of adultery, fornication, drunkenness, swearing, oppressing,
defrauding one another, as they fall under scandal. Now this is a calling
distinct from their own calling, in respect the holy Ghost allows to the
Elders stipend and maintenance, 1 Timothy 5. 17. yea, and hire as to laborers,
Matthew. 10. 10. as to soldiers, husbandmen, dress^rs of vineyards, feeders of
flocks, 1 Cor. 9. 7, 8. yea, as to the ox that treads out, or thresheth the
corn, verse. 9. and by this all the people are made officers and stipendiaries,
to whom by the Law of God and nature stipend is due: Now this looscth them from
their own proper callings of Merchandise, Trading, Husbandry, Laws, Medicine,
Manufactures, and makes all these callings sinful and unlawful to the Saints
by calling, who are members of a visible Church, according to that 2 Timothy 2. 4.
No man that warreth, int angleth himself with the affairs (or callings) of
this life, which is gross Anabaptisme condemned by Gods Word, 1 Cor. 7. 20,
21. Ephesians. 6. 5. Col. 2. 22. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 11. Now certainly, if actual
government, with the power of the Keys, be committed to all the members of the
visible Church, the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, and Canons of right
government must be written to Timothy and Titus, not as to Pastors, but as to
believers, as the Keys were given in Peter's person, and a warrant to bind and
loose, Matthew 18. Matthew. 16. as representing believers, not as to a Pastor: then
they are to commit the word to faithful men, who are able to teach others, and
to give up their earthly callings, as 2 Timothy 2. 2 3, 4. and to lay hands
suddenly on no man, and not to receive a testimony against an Elder, but before
two or three witnesses, 1 Timothy 5. 22, 19. and to war a good warfare, 1 Timothy 1.
18. And this must needs follow, since Separatists teach, That all the people
are obliged in Conscience to judge, and to be personally present, and that by
their Office and Church-calling, when ever any sentence is given out against
offenders; for, if the Elders be only present and the people absent, the
Elders shall tyrannize Answ. in his Animadvers. page 42, 43.
(says Answorth) over the peoples Consciences; for the people being absent
shall not know if the Eldership have proceeded right, yet must they repute the
excommunicated person as an heathen or a publicane.

3. Arg. That government is not to be admitted which makes men take honor to
themselves, without God calling them thereunto. But the Doctrine of government
in the hands of people is such, ergo; the assumption is proved: 1. By it, all
are Kings, Rulers, and Guides, and all have the most supreme power of the
Keys, as authoritative receiving in of members, and judicial casting out, by
the pastoral spirit of Paul, and all govern over all. 2. Believers are a
ministerial Church, a company of private Christians put in office, and doing
acts of a Ministeries now a Ministry is a peculiar state of eminency that God
calle^h some selected and gifted persons unto that to the which he calle^h not
all professors, as in Israel he chosed, one Tr be H^b. 8. 2. Ez^k. 7. 24. Ezr.
8. 17. Jer. 33. 21. Ezekiel. 44. 11. Jod. 1. 9. Ez^k. 45. 5. Ex. 28. 1. 3. 35. Ex.

to minister to himself, not all the visible Church of Israel, as the
Scripture teaches us. Ministers of the house of God, the Levites, the Lords
Ministers, Ministers of Gods Sanctuary, and the ministry of the Ephesians. 3. 7.
Col. 1. 25. Col. 4. 7. 1 Thest. 3. 2. 1 Timothy 4. 6. Acts 26. 16.
New Testament, is a special emi^ency of office given to some few, and not to
all believers, Ephesians. 4. 12. Colos. 4. 17. 1 Timothy 1. 12. Act. 1. 17. 25.
a matter of work that some, not all believers are put upon, and employed in,
1 Cor. 4. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 4. 1. 2 3. 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20. 2 Cor. 3. 3, 4, 5. Gal.
6. 6.
the act, of the Ministry not common to all, but restricted to the Ministers
of the Church, and not common to the whole visible Church. Now to ordain
Elders, excommunicate, admit members into the Church, are positive acts of a
received ministry, and must flow from an other principle, then that which is
common to all professing believers.

4. Arg. All who have received such a Ministerial state to discharge such
excellent and noble acts, as laying on of hands, receiving of witnesses,
committing the Gospel to faithful men, who are able to teach others, and must
save some by gentle awaiting, and stop the mouths of other Pastors, as 1 Timothy
5. 22. 19. 2 Timothy 2. 2. 2 Timothy 3. 15. Tit. 1. 11.
the Scripture says, these must acquit themselves as approved worke-men to
God, and shall therefore receive a Crown of Glory at the appearance of the
chief Shepherd, and must in a special manner fight the good fight of Faith,
and must be worke-men who need not to be ashamed. But these are not required
of all the Church visible; all are not men of God, and ministerial Soldiers
of Christ, and feeders of the flock, but only such as Timothy, Titus, and
Elders like to Peter, as these 2 Timothy 2. 15 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. 5. 1 Timothy 6. 12 1 Timothy 6. 11. 1 Timothy 6. 13, 14.
Scriptures prove. For the reward of a prophet is not due to all.

5. Arg. That Government is not of God which takes away the ordinary degrees
of members in Christ's body the Church. But government exercised by all the
visible body takes away the deversity of offices, members, places, of Rulers
and ruled, Ergo; I prove the assumption. 1. All have one and alike equal power
of governing, all the members are one in place, and office, all are Eyes, all
Ears, all are hands, according as all have one joint and common interest, and
claim to Christ. One is not an Eye and head in relation to another: for all
are both governors and governed, all the Watchmen, and all the City; all the
flock, and all the feeders, all the House, and all Rulers, Key-bearers,
Stewards, all the children of the house, all the Fathers, Tutors, to bring up,
nu^ture, and correct the children. 2. If the power and use of the Keys result
from this, that the Corporation is the Spouse, Body, Sister of Christ, the
redeemed flock, what should hinder but according as God inequally dispenses
the measure of grace, to some more, to some l^sse, so some should have more,
some less power of the keys, and some exercise more eminent acts of
government, as they be more eminent in grace; some less eminent acts; and if
we grant this, we cannot deny the order of a Hierarchy amongst Pastors. This
connection may be denied happily by our brethren, but there is no reason, if
their arguments be good, they always conclude Church Power from the graces of
the members of the Church.

3. Concl. It is clear then that the state of the Church cannot be called
popular, and the government Aristocraticall, or in the hands of the Elders, as
our brethren mean. 1. Because by our brethren, the government and the most
eminent and authoritative acts thereof are in the hands of the people. Ergo,
both state and government are popular. 2. Because the people are not only to
consent to the censures, and acts of government, but also authoritatively to
judge with coequal power with the Eldership, as they prove from, 1 Cor. 5. 12.
3. Page 10.
The Parisian Doctors, the authors of this distinction acknowledge a visible
monarchy in the Church, and are far from popular government.

Let us hear what our brethren say for the government of the people, and their
judicial power in general.

Quest. 15. Our brethren say, the Colossians are exhorted, Col. 4. 17. to say
to Archippus, Take heed to the Ministry, that thou have received of the Lord,
to fulfill it in all points; Ergo, the people are to censure and rebuke the
Pastors, and therefore they may, and ought to exercise acts authoritative.

Ans. 1. This is an argument off the way with reverence. (...) say to
Archippus, take heed, Ergo, say Judicially and rebuke with all authority, it
is an argument a genere ad speciem affirmative, and a non-consequence, Mat. 18.
17. If he will not hear them, (...) tell the Church; Ergo, exercise an act of
authority over the Church, Ioh. 8. 48. The Jews said unto him. Ergo, they said
it authoritatively, 1 Ioh. 1. 8. If we say, (...), we have no sin; by no
authority can we say we have no sin, Luke 12. 11. Take not thought (...) what
ye shall say Rev. 22. 17. 2. The Fathers, as August. de civ. Det. l. 1. c. 9.
Augustine, Chrysostom. Homil. in Exodus 23.
Chrysostom, Ambros. in Luc. 17.
Ambrose, Hiieronimus in Luc. 18.

Aquinas, Bannes, in 1 33. art. 2.
D. Bannes, Suarez, tom. de fid. spe and charit. d^s. 8. de con.
Suarez, say, correcting of our brother is, ( sublevatio miseriae peccantis.) a
succouring of the misery of a sinner. Cajetan. in 22. q. 33. ar. 1.
Cajetan^ait, actum correctionis elici a prudentia, imperari a misericordia: To
warn or rebuke our brother is an act of prudence commanded by mercy and
compassion. And. Duvallius in 22. tom. poster. tract. de charit. q. 9. art. 2.
And. Duvalius says, it is an act, Non solum juris divini, sed etiam
naturalis; and he cites Lev. 19. Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy heart,
but shall rebuke him; and shall bear one another burdens, and so fulfill the
Law of Christ. And Gregor. de valent. tom. 3. dis. 3. de correc. fra. quest.
10. punct. 2.
Greg. de Valent. says it is a spiritual alms, and actum misericordiae, quo

of the Canon Law. So the Fathers say, Basil in Ps. 14.

Augustine. Vulnus fratr is contemnis, vides cum perire and negligis, pejor es

Excellently Hieronim. Sivide at in corpore carnes putridas, and dicat. An ad

Nazianz. Charitatem potius hic quam potestatem ostendendam. To rebuke is a
work of charity, rather then of power. Calvin in Epist. ad col. c. 4.
Calvin says, Good Ministers stand in need to be admonished. Davenantius com.
ib.
Davenant thinks that Archippus in the absence of Epaphras his colleague was
to supply his absence, and, it is like, was somewhat cold, and therefore needed
to be admonished. But because the Collossians were to exercise an act of mercy
toward their Pastor, which the Law of nature enjoined them, it is a wide
inference, therefore they had Church authority and power over him, to censure,
deprive excommunicate him; so the faithful receives a charge, Hos. 2. 1. Say
ye to your brethren Ammi, and to your sisters Ruhammah. 2. Plead with your
mother, plead; pleading for wheredomes is more then a simple exhorting of
Archippus, yet none can well collect from these words, that those faithful who
kept themselves clean from the common defection, had power of jurisdiction
over their breath en, sisters, and mother, to censure them judicially, and by
authority to un-Church them. And certainly the Apostle, if he had commanded
here the judicial act of Church-jurisaiction to all the Saints of Colosle, men
and women who may admonish Archippus, we we would look he had said, (command,
and charge with all authority Archippus to take heed to his ministry.) Also,
it is much to be doubted, if the duties of rebuking, exhorting, and comforting
one another, be positive acts of Church Membership, which the fellow members of
a visible Congregation owe one to another by virtue of a Church Covenant, or
that the people owe to the Pastor in a Church way, for these (ex hort, teach,
comfort one another) are duties mutual, not restricted to fellow members of a
visible Church, or Parish, but such as we owe to all the members of the
Catholic Church, as we are occasionally in company with them. Yea, and duties
(as our brethren say) that sister Churches owe to sister Churches, and acts of
the Law of nature that we owe to all, as brethren, not as brethren in
Church Membership, Levit. 19. 17. only.

I will here answer: What Robinson says, Robinson justif. separation p 124,
125. 126 167.
By the Keys is meant the Gospel opening a way by Christ and his merits, as
the door into the Kingdom, the power of binding and loosing, opening and
shutting Heaven, is not tied to any Office or Order in the Church, it depends
only upon Christ, who alone properly forgiveth sins, and has the Key of
David, and this Key externally is the Gospel, which, with himself, he gives
to the Church, Isa. 6. 9. Romans 3. 2. Ergo, the Keys are given to all, though
not to be used by all and every one alike, which were gross confusior. The
Keys were not given to Peter as Prince of the Apostles, as Papists say, nor to
Peter as chief Officer of the Church, and so to Prelates; nor to Peter as a
Minister of the Word and Sacraments; but we say, to the conf^ssion of faith,
which Peter made by way of answer to Christ's demand, and therefore to every
faithful man and woman, who have received the like precious faith with Peter,
2 Pet. 1. 1.

Ans. 1. If the Keys be given to as many as the Gospel is given unto, all
have the Keys who are believers, children, women, whether within or without
the Church; for all have obtained alike precious faith. So it is vain to
speak there of a Church builded on the Rock^, or of any ministerial Church.
2. The Keys are not given to the naked Office or Order, distinct from the
spirits working and proving the acts of preaching and discipline to be mighty
through God, 2 Cor. 10 5. to open hearts, Act. 16. 14. for what, or who is
Paul? and who is Apollo, but Ministers by whom ye believed? 1 Cor. 3. 4 5. and
Christ alone works with the Sacraments, and without him great John Baptist
can but baptize with water. Joh. 1. 26. yet all say administration of
Sacraments externally is so tied to the Office, as none can administer them
without warrant, but Pastors, 1 John 5. 25 Math. 26 19. 1 Cor. 1. 17. and
therefore this is weak, to prove that because Christ only has the Keys of
the Word; yea, and of the Sacraments also. that therefore he has not committed
the Keys to certain Officers under him, who are Stewards, and Key-bearers. 3.
The places alleged prove not Is. 6. 9. Christ is given to us, that is, to the
Church, as to the subject; O say it not, but to us the Church, as the object
and end for our salvation. Ergo, the Keys and the Gospel are given to the
Church, yea and to every faithful, that they may, by preaching, open and shut
Heaven. You cannot say so. Also Romans 3. 2. to the Jews were committed the
Oracles and Scriptures, that every one might be a Priest and Prophet, to teach
and sacrifice; it is a shame to say so: but to the Jews, as to the object and
end, that by the Scriptures and faith in these Oracles, they might be saved. 4.
The Keys, that is, the Gospel, is given to all, though not to be used alike
by all and every one; which were gross confusion: that is the same we say, the
Gospel in use is not given alike to all; but to the believers as to the object
and end; to the Officers, as to the subject and proper instrument. And so you
fall into gross confusion while you eschew it.

Robinson, Robinson justif. p. 127.
The Keys be one and the same in efficacy and nature, and depend not upon the
number and excellency of any persons, but upon Christ alone, though the order
and manner of using them be different.

Ans. The Sacraments remain one and the same in nature and efficacy, who ever
be the persons, many or few, excellent or not excellent, in whose hands soever
they be; it follows not therefore, the power of administration of Sacraments
is given to all. 2. We see no difference in the order and manner of using the
keys; if all, even a faithful man or woman either, may also truly and
effectually loose and bind both in heaven and in earth, as all the Ministers
of the world, for those be Rob. lb. page 127.
your words.

Robinson. lb.
These keys in doctrine may be turned also as well upon them, which are
without the Church, as upon them which are within, and their sins either
loosed or bound, Matthew. 28 19. in discipline not so, but only on them that are
within. 1 Cor. 5 13.

Answ. If this distinction were in Gods Word, we would receive it, but seeing
by preaching there is receiving in and casting out, and binding and loosing. I
ask, how these, who were never within, can be judged and cast out by
preaching more then by discipline; may Pastors judge these who are without by
preaching, and not judge those who are without by discipline, and that in a
settled Church?

Robinson. Rob. Ib. 127, 128.
There is an use of the keys public, ministerial, by men in office, by the
whole Church jointly together, or private, by one person severally who is out
of office, and yet the power of the Gospel is still one and the same,
notwithstanding the diverse manner of using it.

Answ. 1. If one alone have the keys spoken of, Matthew. 16. there be keys
Ministerial made by Christ before the house be builded, and have walls, roof,
or door, the keys all take to be metaphorical, and to presuppose a company,
a constituted Church, where some are put in, some put out; these private keys
of women to open and shut heaven upon men, and so to usurp authority over the
man, are no Church-keyes, and if they be not Church-keyes they are not for our
dispute.

Robinson Ib. 128.
If the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven be appropriated to the officers, then
can there be no forgiveness of sins without the officers, and there is no
entrance into heaven but by the door, there is no climbing over any other way,
and without the key the door cannot be opened: Then if there be no officers in
the Church, or if they take away the key of knowledge Mat. 23. 13.
then must the multitude perish eternally.

Answ. Though the keys be appropriated to officers, it follows not, There is
no forgiveness of sins, nor opening of Heaven at all without officers; but
only no Ecclesiastical forgiveness, no Church-opening by a Ministerial
power, but through Ministerial keys; and opening cannot ordinarily be without
officer^. Faith comes by hearing, Ergo, no faith by reading. Baptism saves,
Ergo, no salvation without Baptism, so do Anabaptists reason, as says
Gerard. loc. com. tom. 6. de minist. Eccles. n. 64. page 71.
Gerardus; so reasons Socinus tract de Eccles. page 14.
Socinus, averring, It is a work of charity necessary to salvation, therefore
all may preach; and the same does both the Raccovian^ Catechis. ^ Raccov. 2.
page 1 44.
Catechism and Ostorod. in insi^t. German. cap. 42. p. 437.
Ostorodius say, yea, and Theoph. Nicolaides Theoph. Nicolaides defens. Soc. de
Eccles. cap. 1. page 146.
defending Muncerus the Anabaptist. Though keys be a public ordinary mean
in a constituted Church, it follows not therefore, there is no other way of
opening Heaven. In the Sacraments remission of sins is sealed, and heaven
opened, it follows not therefore, all may administer the Sacraments. 2. What
inference is here? if the keys be appropriated to officers, then people must
perish when officers fail; certainly so says the Lords Spirit: Proved. Prove.
29. 18.
Where there is no vision, the people perish; and this is a fearful soul
judgment, when God removes the Rev. 2. 5.
candlestick* Psalm 74. 9.
and there is no prophet to show how long; Amos 8. 11, 12.
and the people are plagued with a famine of the word of God; yet there be
other means then public ministry.

He adds: Rob. justif. of separation, page 128, 129.
They which may forgive sin and sinners, save souls, gain and turn men to
the Lord, to them are the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven given, by which they
open the door to such as they thus forgive, gain, and save. But all th^se,
such as are no Ministers may do, as Matthew. 18. 15. 2 Corinthians. 2. 5, 7, 8, 9,
10. Acts 8. 14.

Answ. The proposition is false, for all who open the door by exhorting and
gaining souls, as Christians in no Church State may in some cases do, have
not the Church-keyes; for this were to make Church keys without any Church,
and to make keys without house, door, or lock: for the keys are
metaphorically so called, with necessary relation to the Church, the house of
God, and to the stewards of the house; the places alleged are the
controversy it self, and to others of them I shall answer hereafter.

Robinson. Rob. 129.
The twelve Apostles were not called to the office of Apostles, Matthew. 16.
Ergo, they do not as Apostles receive the keys.

Answ. I trust to prove the contrary hereafter. 2. If the Apostles, Matthew. 16.
received not the keys, by no warrant are the keys given to Pastors at all.

Robinson. Robins. 129, 130.
Every servant in the house, no less then Officers have authority; for the
word carries authority with it whither soever it goes, Matthew. 25. 14. and all
have received some good thing or gift for the good of the Church, and all
should watch, but especially the porter.

Answ. What can be hence collected? Ergo, the keys are given to all, and all
are porters, and all should watch as porters; for, the word of exhorting given
to all, is of like authority when a woman or boy speaks it, as when a Prophet
speaks it. But it is not good to help Arminius and Jesuits, who reason for
universal grace given to all and every one from these Parables: Mr. Pemble,
and opposers of Jesuits, in the doctrine of grace, expound this of Pastors. 2.
But let the Parable speak of all; all have authority, because all have the
word, all who privately exhort have the word, have authority objective, and of
divine obligation, as Christians, it is true; Ergo, all have the keys, it
follows not: but all who privately and occasionally exhort, have not
authority official by the calling of God and his Church, and therefore they
have not this, they have not the keys; and the word by public preaching none
have, but usurpers, (save only called Officers) and because they steal the
Word, they steal the Keys also; and because the Sacraments have authority
from God, it follows not therefore that Baptism administrated by women is of
authority.

Robinson Rob. 129, 130.
acknowledges, that Elders and Bishops were ordained to suppress false
doctrine, and lay hands suddenly on no man; but it follows not (says he)
that they are to do this there alone.

Answ. There alone they must lay on hands, that is, with the Presbytery, and in
a judicial way excluding all the people; for people never in the new Testament
laid on hands upon any, to ordain them Elders, nor did they it in the old
Testament.

Robinson. Rob. 133, 134.
The officers, Ephesians 4. 11. are chosen of Christ to watch; so Mark 13. the
porter should watch; Ergo, the rest of the servants should not watch, it
follows not, Officers are to knit together the Saints, and so are all who are
spiritual, Gal. 6. 1. The Officers are to edify, so are all to edify one
another, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11.

Answ. The argument must be thus, These who are to watch, to knit together the
Saints, to edify them, have received the keys, and are Governors, and are
Officers; but all the faithful are to watch, to knit together the Saints,
Ergo; first, the major is false; for if because the Saints may edify, they
shall have joint power and use of the keys with the Officers, they may
administrate the Sacraments. Now, because they may in a Christian way do some
acts of edifying, it follows not that therefore they may do these acts by
power of the keys, and with an Ecclesiastical and Church Power; they may do
the same duty, Ergo, with the same power. A scholar may teach his
school-fellow the same lesson that his Master does teach him; Ergo, he may do
it by the same Magisteriall authority: A wife may cure a disease, Ergo, she
may by the same authority that a Doctor of Physic, approved by the
incorporation of Physicians, cure a disease, it follows not:

Robins. God has indeed set in the body some to be eyes and mouth, and has
not said to all the Church, Go and preach; but, first, they have not their
gifts from the Church. Secondly, you would have the body to starve, if such
hands as Deacons will not feed; and all the body blind, if the eyes of the
watchmen be blind.

Answ. Yet thus much is granted, that gifts give not the keys, nor authority
to use gifts; and so that all believers, though gifted and graced also, have
not power of the keys. 2. It Is certain, that in a constituted Church there be
no hands nor mouths to do and speak by authority, and ex officio, by virtue
of an office, save only Elders and Pastors, and that if they do or speak,
they do it extraordinarily, when Churches hands are lame, and her eyes blind;
or if they do and speak ordinarily, it is from the law of charity in a
private way, not by power of the keys, and as Judges and Officers.

Manuscript. 5 chapter 4 sect.

The Churches, not the Angels of the Churches, are blamed for Way of the Church
of Christ, in n. E.
not executing censures against Balaam, Jezabel, the Nicolaitans. (g) Robinson
says more, 1. These whose works Christ commends, (b) Robinson page 141.
for that dwelling where Satan's throne was, they kept his name and denied not
his faith; these he reproves for suffering the doctrine of Balaam and the
Nicolaitans 13, 14, 15, 16. 2. They which were commended by Christ, for their
works, love, service, faith, patience, increase of works; are reproved for
suffering Jezabel, but these were not the Angels only. 3. These conjunctions
(but) (never the less) say, though they were z^alous in many things, yet they
failed in not being zealous enough against false teachers.

Ans. 1. These connexions prove guiltiness in Angels or Pastors, and one
common fault may be laid upon them all, but hence it follows not; that they
all, abused one and the same power of the Keys, as being all collateral
Judges, no doubt the Angels preached not against Balaam, J^zabel, and the
Nicolaitans doctrine, and yet women dwelt where Satan's throne is, and there
faith and patience was commended, and yet our brethren will not say women are
rebuked, and all the believers, because they did not pastorally preach against
Balaam, and Iezabel; so this argument hurts them as much as our cause. The
Pastors were guilty, because they did not in their place use the Keys; and the
people, because they did not say to Archippus and their Officers, Take heed how
you govern; as Israel was involved in Achans trespass, because they warned
not one another. 2. Seeing the Spirit of God makes mention of Churches in the
plural number, and every one of the seven Churches, of Ephesus, Rev. 2. 7. of
S^yrna, v. 11. of Pergamus 17. of Thyatira 29 of Sardis 3. 6. Philadelphia 13.
Laodicea 22. It is clear, there were more Churches then a single Congregation,
and an independent incorporation in every one of them, and so a Presbytery of
Angels in every one of them behoved to be guilty of this neglect of discipline,
yet not all one and the same way. It is not clear enough, though that the
whole Church in Ephesus was to be rebuked, or that all and every one of the
Elders, whereof there were a good number, (Act. 20. 26. He prayed with them all
they all wept sore,) were guilty of these abuses of the power of the Keys; for
in Sardis there were a few names which had not defiled their garments, yet the
whole body is rebuked.

Manuscript, Chapter 5. Sect. 4.

When the word Congregation is put for the Elders or Judges only, Way of the
Church of chapter in n. E.
it is never understood of them sitting in consistery and judgment there alone
by themselves, and apart from the people, but in the presence of the public
assembly, who also had liberty in such cases to rescue an innocent from unjust
judgment, 1 Samuel 14. 45.

I answer, we urge not a Church assembly of Elders only to exclude the people
from hearing yea and in an orderly way, from speaking, reasoning and disputing
even in our General assembly, but for judicial concluding, we find not that
given to any, but to the Church-guides, Act. 15. 6. Act. 16. 4. 2 It is not a
good argument, the people sat with the Rulers and rescued innocent Jonathan, 1 Samuel 14. Therefore all the people may fit and give judicial sentence or impede
the Elders to sentence any. This I grant, is alleged by Ainsnorth Ainsnorth.
for to give popular government to the people; as also, 1 King 21. 13. and Ier.
26. 11, 12. but 1. a fact of the people is not a Law. 2. It was one fact and
that in an extraordinary case of extreme iniquity in killing innocent Jonathan
a Prince and Leader of the people. 3. in a civil business, and the people
were to be executioners of the sentence of death, and they saw it manifestly
unjust. 4. they were not the common people only, but in thar company were the
Princes of the Tribes and heads, and the King and his family only on the other
side; what will this infer, but that there were no Kings in Israel, who had
power of life and death, nor any judges, as Ainsworth, contrary to Scripture
says, but that the people were joint Judges with the King, and that the people
in the New Testament are co-equall Judges with the Elders, from so poor an
example; and so the Separatists Cons. art. 24. ap 8.
proving from the peoples power of judging in civil causes (which yet is a
wide mistake) and a punishment bodily to be inflicted upon strangers as John
Paget defense of
Paget does learnedly observe; do conclude the peoples power of judging in
Ecclesiastic causes, which concerns only the members Church-gover. chapter 3.
pa. 13. and p 7.
of the visible Church.

Manuscript.

We grant, it is orderly to tell the Elders the offense, that the whole Manus.
ih, chapter 5. Sect. 4.
Church be not frivolously troubled; but it follows not, that the Officers
may judge there alone without consent of the people: he who told his complaint
to the Levite, told it orderly enough to the whole Congregation assembled at
Mizpeh Jud. 20.

Ans. These to whom we are to complain, these and these only, are to be heard,
and obeyed as Judges binding and loosing in Earth and validly in Heaven, Mat.
18. but these are not the multitude, nor one Elder only, but the Church of
Elders. 2. if the Church of Believers be the only subject (as you teach) of the
Keys, and not the Elders, but in so far as they are parts of the believing
Church, then it is more orderly to complain to the multitude who only are
proper Judges, then to Elders who are not properly Judges.

Manuscript.

A second reason why we allow such power to the people in Ib. Chapter 5. Sect. 4.
Church censures, is from the Church of Corinth. 1. He directs the whole
Church of Corinth to whom he writes, to excomunicate the incestuous man.

Ans. He writes to all the faithful, and so to women; the woman is not to
usurp authority over the man, 1 Cor. 14. 34. 1 Timothy 2. 11, 12. but to voice
judicially in Excommunication is an act of Apostolic authority.

Manuscript.

Ib. The whole Church is to be gathered together and to Excommunicate, Ergo not
the Bishop and Elders alone, 3. Paul's spirit was to be with them and Christ's
authority, 4. the whole Church, 2 Cor. 2. did forgive him, 5. nothing is in the
Text that attributes any power to the presbytery apart, or singularly above
the rest, but as the reproof is directed to all, for not mourning, so is the
Commandment of casting out directed to all.

Ans. 1. It is clear that if some were gathered together in the power of
Christ and the spirit of Paul, that is, in the authority that he received over
the Corinthians, for edification, 2. Cor. 10. 8. and Paul's Rod, 1 Cor. 4. 21.
then as many as were convened Church-ways, and mourned not for the same, did
not cast out and authoritatively forgive; seeing women and believing children
did convene with the whole Church, and were not humbled for the sin; and yet
women and believing children cannot be capable of pastoral authority over the
Church, which was given for edification. 2. The power of the Lord Jesus, that
is, the keys of the Kingdom of God were committed to Peter, as to a Pastor,
Mat. 16. and power to bind and retain, to loose and pardon sins, Joh. 20.
20, 21, 22. Which power is given to these who are sent as Ambassadors as the
Father sent Christ, v. 21. which power cannot be given to puffed up women, 3.
Except this be said, the Text must bear that there was not a Presbytery of
Prophets, Governors and Teachers there of all, who had a more eminent act in
excommunicating and Church pardoning, then the women who mourned not, for by
what reason our brethren would have the act of excommunicating an act of the
whole Church convened, including all to whom Paul writes, women and children,
by that same reason we may appropriate it to these only, who are capable of
Paul's pastoral spirit, and authority, according as attributes are appropriated
(by good logic) to their own subjects, else that cannot be expounded 1 Cor.
14. 31. For ye may all prophecy one by one. What? may all that the Apostle
writes unto, 1 Cor. 1. 2. prophecy one by one? even the whole Church, even all
sanctified in Christ Jesus? called to be Saints, and all that in every place
call upon the Lord Jesus? I think our brethren will not say so: so when Paul
says, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. Esteem highly of these that are over you if that command
be directed to the whole Church of the Thessalonians which is in God our
Father, as the Epistle is directed to them all, 1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. then does Paul
command the Elders in Thessalonica to esteem highly of themselves, for their
own works sake: if exhortations be not restricted according to the nature of
the subject in hand we shall mock the Word of God, and make it ridiculous to
all.

Ainsworth says, The putting away of leaven was commanded to all Israel. Ergo,
the putting away of the incestuous person is commanded to them all in Corinth
without exception, and the putting away of the Leper was commanded to all
Israel.

I answer. 1. Proportions are weak probations, 1. every single woman, 2.
privately in her own house, 3. without Churches consent and authority was to
put away Leaven; but it is a poor inference, therefore every woman in Corinth
he^e alone might excommunicate without the Churches authority, and in their
private houses. 2. The Priest only judicially puts away the Leper, Deuteronomy. 17.
13. and the Priests without the peoples consent put out Uzzah their Prince from
the Sanctuary, when he was a Leper. 2. Ch^on. 26. 20.

Manuscript.

Lest this judgment should be restrained to Presbyteries only, he Manuscript,
^b.
magnifieth the judging of the Saints, taking occasion from thence to stretch
their judicature, in some cases, even to the deciding of civil causes, rather
then that they should fly suddenly to Law one against another, before Infidels.

Ans. That upon this Church judging, he takes occasion to magnifiy the judging
of the Saints, I see not, for he passes to a new subject in reprehending their
pleadng, before heathen Judges. 2. Though that cohesion of the Chapters were
granted, yet does he not magnify the Judging, of all the multitude, the Saints
of men and women shall judge the world by assenting to Gods Judging, but all
the Saints, even women, are not Church-Iudges. Also he extends Judging of
civil causes to the most eminent Seniors amongst them v. 5. Is there not a
wiseman amongst you? no, not one who shall be able to judge betwixt his
brethren? and therefore he lays a ground, that far less can all the rest of
men and women be Judges Ecclesiastic to bind and loose validly in Earth and
Heaven, but only the wiser and selected Elders.

I may add what Master Robinson says, that our argument from confession, may
be objected to the Apostles no less then to Separatists, Acts 1. 23. They
presented two; that is, the multitude which were about an hundred and twenty
men and women, and Act 6. 5. And the while multitude presented seven Deacons to
the twelve Apostles, and the twelve Apostles called the multitude, and so spoke
to them and v. 6. prayed and laid hands on the Deacons. Now when the multitude
Acts 1. presented Joseph and Matthias, it behoved them to speak; spoke they
jointly, or all at once? this were confusion, contrary to, 1 Cor. 14. 14. did
the women speak? they must not meddle in Church-maters, v. 34. did children
speak? It is impossible; so Acts 6. did all the twelve Apostles speak at once?
and pray (vocally) at once? did the whole multitude speak when they presented
the seven Deacons? that is confusion; by these and the like, women and children
are utterly excluded from the Church, as no parts of it, Acts 15. 22. The whole
Church sent Messengers to Antioch, 1 Co^. 14. 23. the whole Church comes
together in one, to exercise themselves in praying and prophesying, but
children could not send messengers nor pray, nor prophecy, and women might not
speak in the Church, and therefore women and children must be excluded from
being parts of the Church; if one be excluded, why not another? and so till we
come to the chief of the Congreation.

Ans. This is much for us every way; therefore the 120, Acts 1. and the
multitude, Acts 6. did present the two elect Apostles, and the seven Deacons by
some select persons, and when these select persons spoke, the Church spoke, and
when one Apostle prayed the whole twelve prayed; Ergo, there is a
representative Church which performs Church actions in the name of the
Church, and you will have a representative Church in the New Testament to be a
point (as you say Inf. page 163
) of Judaisme; yet here you are forced to acknowledge it, 2. By all good reason
when Christ, Mat. 18. says if he refuse to hear the Church, that is, the
speaking and commanding Church, let him be as a heathen, he must speak of a
representative Church; for a collective body of all believers even women and
children cannot command, nor soeak in the Church, and it were confusion that
women and children should bind and loose on Earth as Christ does in Heaven, and
when Paul says that the convened Church, 2 Cor. 5. should cast out the
incestuous person, he means not that they should all Judge him by the power
and authority of Christ, and the pastoral spirit of Paul; therefore your
doctrine is false, that as many are Judges in the Judicial acts of
excommunication, as did not mourn for the sin, as were Saints by calling, and
to whom Paul writes, 1 Cor. 2. and as met together for the public worship,
for it is as great confusion for women and children who are true parts of the
Church to be Judges, clothed with Christ's authority, and Paul's Ministerial
spirit, as for women to speak, or for twelve Apostles to pray all at once
vocally in the Church; and the whole Church is said, Acts 15. 22. to send
messengers, and Canons to Antioch to be observed, and yet that whole Church are
but, in the act of governing and decerning, and judicial passing of these
acts, only Apostles and Elders, Acts 15. 2. v. 6. Act 16. 4: Act. 21. 5. (
Ergo) it follows not that we exclude women and children from being parts of
the Church, or that all are excluded except Elders; all are parts of the
mystical, and redeemed Church; officers are only the ministerial Church, and
Mat. 18. Christ speaks only of a ministerial Church in the judicial act of
excommunication; though if you speak of excommunication in all the acts of it,
we do not exclude the whole multitude, Mat. 8. nor 1 Cor. 5. from a popular
consenting to the sentence, and a popular execution of the sentence of
excommunication and therefore though the whole Church convene, yet the whole
Church conveneth not with Paul's ministerial spirit to excommunicate
judicially; either must our brethren here acknowledge a Synocdoche, as well as
we, yea and a representative and select Church in the judicial act of
excommunication, else they must say, that women and children, Ex officio, by a
ministerial spirit do Judge and so speak in the Church, for he who Judges
Ex officio, in the Church, may and must speak and excommunicate in the Church
Ex officio: but more of this hereafter.

CHAP. 3. SECT. 3. QUEST. 4.
WHether or no is there a necessity of the personal presence of the whole
Church in all the acts of Church Censures?

The Author Manuscript. The way of the Church of Chapter in n. E.
gives us ground for this question, whiles as he holds the company of
believers clothed with the whole power of the keys, and these meeting all of
them, even the whole Church to be the only visible instituted Church. And
Ainsworth animad verse. p. 20. 21.
Ainsworth says, with what comfort of heart can the people now excommunicate
him, if they have not heard the proceedings against him? Let wise men Judge, if
this be not spiritual tyranny, that Elders would bring upon the conscience of
men? Also it would seem^ if the people be to execute the sentence of
excommunication, that they cannot in faith repute the excommunicated man, as a
Heathen and a Publican, and eschew his company, except they be assured in
conscience, that he is lawfully cast out: now how shall they have this
assurance? the Elders say, he is lawfully cast out, and the cast out man says,
no, but he is wronged; therefore it would seem that all the people must be
personally present to hear that the process be lawfully deduced against him,
else they punish, upon a blind faith, now the like question is, if Soldiers
can make war, if they be not present at the counsel of war to know the just
reasons of war, which the Prince and States do keep up to themselves, upon
grave considerations. And the same is the question, if the Lictor and
executioner of the Judges sentence be obliged in conscience to know, if the
Judge have proceeded orderly and justly, or if he upon the testimony of the
Judge, may execute the sentence of death.

1. Distinction, There be odds betwixt a free willing people executing the
sentence of the Church, and mere Executioners and Lictors.

2. Did. There is a doubting of conscience speculative, through ignorance of
some circumstance of the fact; and a doubt of conscience practical through
ignorance of something, which one is obliged to know, and so there is also a
speculative and a practical certainty of a thing.

3. Did. There is one certaeinty required in questione Juris, in a question of
Law, and another in questione facti, in question of fact.

4. Did. There is, and may be an ignorance invincible which a man cannot help,
in a question of fact; but Papists and Schoolmen err, who maintain an
invincible ignorance in questione Juris, in a question of Law, and in this they
lay imperfection on Gods Word.

5. Did. There is a moral diligence given for knowledge of a thing which
suffices to make the ignorance excusable, and there is a moral diligence not
sufficient.

6. Did. There is a sentence manifestly unjust as the condemning of Christ by
witnesses, belying one another, and a sentence doubtsomely false.

1. Conclu. The members of the visible Church are not mere Lictors and
Executioners of the sentences of the Elder-ship, 1. Because they are to
observe, warn, watch over the manners of their fellow members and to teach,
exhort, and admonish one another; and are guilty, if they be deficient in that,
2. Because by the Law of charity, as they are brethren under one head Christ,
they are to warn and admonish their Rulers. And by the same reasons the people
of the Jews were not mere executioners, though they were to stone the
condemned Malefactors, yet were they not Judges as Ainsworth says. It is true
Levit. 20. 2. they were to kill him who offered his seed to Moloch; but the
precept is given first to Moses the supreme Magistrate, the accused for
innocent blood stood before the children of Israel, Number. 35. 22. but their
Gnedah signifies the Princes, I^s. 20. 4. The slayer shall declare his cause
before the Elders of that City, 2 Samuel 7. 7. there be Tribes who are feeding or
governing Tribes, or 1 Chronicles. 17. 6. Judges: there is no reason to understand
by the children of Israel or the Congregation, only the common people, when the
word does include a Congregation of Princes, so Number. 8. 11. the Levites are the
children of Isreal's shake-offering Ainsworth animadvers. p. 25.
Ainsworth says the people are put for the Princes, the sins of unjust Judges
are peoples sins, not because they judicially exercise unjust acts, for they
should not judge at all, but because they mourn not for the public sins of
Judges, Eze. 9 9. and because the people love to have it so, Jer. 5. 31.

2. Concl. When the sentence of the Judge is manifestly unjust, the
executioners and Lictors are not to execute it; for Doeg the Edomite sinned in
killing the Lords Priests at the command of Saul, and the footmen of Saul did
religiously refuse that service, 1 Samuel 22. 17. The Soldiers who crucified
Christ, not only as men, but as Licto^s, sinned against a principle of the
Gospel which they were obliged to believe ( Mary's son is the true Messiah)
nor are we to join with a Church excommunicating a man, because he confessed
Christ Job. 9. nor need we consent to these, that the Senate of Venice is
excommunicated by Paul the fifth An. 1607. and Henricus Borbonius King of
Navarre by Sixtus 5. and Elizabeth of England by Pius 5. and Henry the 4. by
Gregory 7. or Hilderland, and Martin Luther by Leo the 10. An. 1520. the Pope
is not the Catholic Church, as many learned Papists, especially, the Parisian
Theologues teach.

3. Concl There is not required the like certainty of conscience practical in
a question of fact, that is required in a question of Law. 1. Because in a
question of Law all ignorance is moral and culpably, evil to any who
undertaketh actions upon conscience of obedience to others; for to all within
the visible Church the word of God is exactly perfect, for faith and manners;
and every on is obliged to know all conclusions of Law that are determinable by
Gods word. 2. Every one in his actions is to do^ out of a plerophorie, and a
full persuasion of heart, that what he does, pleases God, Romans 14. 14. I know
and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of it self. 3. We
are to do nothing but what is lawful, and what in our consciences we are
persuaded is lawful, and are to know what is sin, and what is no sin. All
Soldiers in war, and Lictors, and these who execute the sentence of
excommunication, are to know, what are the just causes of war, and what crimes
by Gods Law deserve death, and what not, as what homicide, sorcery, parricide,
incest, and the like sins deserve by Gods Law, and what not: because every
one is obliged to know morally, what concerns his conscience that he be not
guilty before God; the executioner who beheaded John Baptist sinned, because he
was obliged to know this ( a prophet who rebukes incest in a King, ought not
to be put to death therefore) It was unlawful for the men of Judah to come and
make war with Jeroboam and the ten Tribes, because God forbade that war, 1 Ki.
12. 23, 24.

4. Concl. It is not enough that some say, if the question be negatively just,
then Soldiers and executioners, and people may execute the sentence, that is,
if they see no unlawfulness in the fact, I mean unlaw fullness in materia
juris, in a matter of Law; hence some say, subjects and common Soldiers not
admitted to the secrets of the council of war, may fight lawfully, when there
is this negative justice in the war; but foreign Soldiers who are conduced,
may not do so Regula juris 19. in 6. and 38. in ff. non est sine culpa, qui,
rebus, quae ad ipsum non spectant, se immiscet, cum periculo alterius.
for the Law says he is not free of a fault who intermedleth with matters
which belong not to him, to the hurt of others; so Teaches Suarez, de tripl.
virt dis. 13. de bello sect. 6. n. 8.
Suarez Bannes in 22. q. 40. concl. 1.
D. Bannes An. Duvallius in 22. tract. de charit. art. 3.
Andr. Duvallius, yet the command of the Prince can remove no doubt of
conscience, also that the cause of the war in the matter of Law, so far as it
is agreeable to Gods word is not manifest to executioners, is there culpable
ignorance no less then the ignorance of a sentence manifestly unjust, Ergo,
the practice of these who execute a sentence negatively only just, is not
lawful, I prove the antecedent, beacuse the practical ignorance of what we
do which is not warranted by Gods Word is always culpable, whether the cause
be clear or dark: for no obscurity of Gods Law does excuse our ignorant
practice, when the Word of God can sufficienty resolve us. 2. It is not enough
that our moral actions in their lawfulnes be just negatively; because actions
moral which are beside the Word of God ( praeter dei verbum) to us, who hold
Gods Word perfect in faith and manners, are also, contra dei verbum, against
the Word of God, and so unlawful. 3. Because actions moral having no warrant
but the sole will and Commandment of superiors, are undertaken upon the sole
faith: that what superiors command, if it seem not to us unjust, though it be
in it self unjust, may lawfully be done. Now we condemn this in Schoolmen
and Popish casuistes, that the Commandment of superiors (as says Gregor. de
Valent. Bannes, Suarez, Silvester, Navarre) may take away and remove all
doubting of conscience, and make the action lawful.

practice, so he practically persuade himselse, he does it out of a good mind;
and whereas the Jesuit says, that it is his negligence in not seeking the
truth, he answers, his negligence which is by past, cannot have influence in
his present action, to make it unlawful, because it is past and gone. But I
answer, it is Physically past, but it is morally present, to infect the action
as habitual ignorance, makes the acts of unbelief morally worse or ill. And
to these we may add, that he who does with such a doubt, 1. He sins,
because he does not in faith Romans 14. 23
2. He exposes himself to the hazard of finning, and of joining with an
unjust sentence. 3. It is the corrupt Doctrine of Papists who muzzle up the
people in ignorance, and discharge them to read Gods Word, and so maintain
(because of the obscurity and imperfection of Gods Word which is not able to
determine all questions) that there is an ignorance of many lawful duties
which is invincible, and to be excused, as no ways sinful, and which
vitiateth not our moral actions, so Thomas 12. q. 19. art. 9.

5. Concl. Soldiers, Lictors, Servants, People under the Eldership, are not
mere instruments moved only by superiors, as Schoolmen say. 1. Because they
are moral agents, and are no less to obey in Faith, then superiors are to
command in Faith and they are to obey their Superiors only in the Lord. 2.
They are to give all diligence that they be not accessory to unjust sentences,
lest they partake of other men's sins. What Aquin. 22. q. 19. art. 9.

and And. Duvallius says against this, is not to be stood upon.

6. Concl. But in questione facti, in matters of fact, there is not required
that certainty of conscience. But that we may more clearly understand the
conclusion, a question of fact is taken three ways. 1. For a fact expressly
set down in Gods Word, as that Moses led the people through the wilderness,
that Cain slew his brother Ab^l, these are questions de facto, not questiones
facti, and must be believed as Almain. de potest. Eccle. and Laica. c. 16.
Almaine and Occam. in. 3. q. 3.
Occam say well, with that same certainty by which we believe Gods Word. 2. A
question of fact is taken for a question, the subject whereof is a matter of
fact, but the attribute is a matter of Law, as (if Christ in saying he was the
Son of God did blasphem) if the Lords Priests in giving David shewbread, did
commit Treason against King Saul) there is some question there made circa
factum, about the fact, but it is formally a question of Law. For these
questions may be cleared by Gods Word, and the ignorance of any questions which
may be cleared by Gods Word, is vincible, and culpable, for the Law says Reg.
juris Culpabilis est ignorantia rerum quas scire tenemur.
The ignorance of these things which we are obliged to know is culpable, and
excuses not. But thirdly a question of fact is properly a question ( whether
this Corinthian committed incest or no) ( whether Tittrs committed murder, or
no) and in this there is sometimes invincible ignorance, when all diligence
morally possible is given, to come to the knowledge of the fact. Now we know
here the question of Law must be proved by the Law, all are obliged in
concience to know what sins deserve death and Excommunication. But whether
this man John, Anna, Marie has committed such sins, is a question of fact and
cannot be proved by the Law, or the Word of God, for Reg. juris lex non est de
singularibus, lex non c^rat de particula^^bus.
the L^^ is not anent singulars or particulars, this is proved by sense and the
Testimony of witnesses; and therefore the certainty practical of conscience
here is humane and failible, not Divine and infallible.

Now though Soldiers, Lictors, or People join to the execution of a sentence,
and have their doubtings anent the fidelity of the witnesses, yet when all
diligence morally possible is given to try the matter, they may well be said to
do in Faith, though they have not certainty of Faith concerning the fact,,
because there cannot be certainty of Divine Faith in facts; men's confession,
sense, the Testimony of witnesses cannot breed Divine Faith: yea here the Judge
himself may condemn the innocent, and yet the sentence of the Judge may be
most just because the witnesses are Liars, and the Judge gives out that
sentence in Faith, because Gods Word has commanded him to proceed, secundum
allegata and probata, he must give sentence under Deuteronomy. 19. 15. Mat. 18. 16. ^
Tim 5. 19. Exodus 23. 1.
two or three witnesses; yea, though the Judge saw, with his Eyes, the guilty
commit the fact, yet he cannot by Gods Law condemn him, but upon the testimony
of witnesses* For the wise Lord sees what confusion and tyranny should follow,
if one might be both Index, actor, and t^stis, the Judge, the accuser, and the
witness. And when the Judge gives out a sentence to absolve the guilty and
condemn the innocent, his sentence is judicially and formally just, and
materially and by accident and contrary to his intention only unjust, if the
Judge in that case should say (as Master Weemes observes well) Ioh. Weemes 3.
vel expos. of judicial Larres chapter 17. p. 69.
such a proposition is true when he knows it to be false, and being posed and
urged in conscience, is this an innocent man or no? it he should answer and say
he is not, he should then answer contrary to his knowledge? but as a Judge he
must answer, he is not innocent, because witnesses being with all possible
diligence examined, have condemned him, and it is no inconvenience here to say,
that the Judge has one conscience as a man, and another contrary conscience as
a Judge, in the question of fact; for God has tied his conscience, as a Judge,
to the fidelity of witnesses, known not to be false. I desire the Reader to see
anent this more in Bonavent. 1. q9.

Henricus. Now because Soldiers, Lictors, and people are not Judges, if they
know the fact in Law deserves such and such punishments, where the sentence is
not manifestly false and unjust, but in the matter of Law just, though
erroneous in the matter of fact, all possible diligence being used by the
Judges, they are to execute that sentence upon the testimony of the Judges,
though they be not personally present at the proceedings of the Judges and
Eldership which may be proved many ways. 1. By the confession of our brethren,
i^ any of the Congregation be absent by Sickness, Childbirth pain, Trading
over Sea, imprisonment, the Congregation does justly put away from amongst them
the incestuous Corinthian, and they who are absent are to repute the party
Excommunicate, as a Heathen; as their own practice is at censures in the
weekday, the largest half of the Congregation is absent, yet the absent upon
the testimony of the Church hold valid what is done by the Church. 2. Other
sister Churches who ought not to be present at Church Censures, as our Brethren
teach, are to repute the Excommunicate cast out by a sister Church-independent
(as they say) as an Heathen, because being bound in Heaven: here, is he not
bound in a Church visible, one mile distant from the Church Excommunicating?
yet this is no tyranny of conscience. 3. Women are to execute the sentence and
to eschew the company of the party Excommunicated, yet are they not to be
present ^s Judges to n^^rp authority over the men. This Robnson justi^. of
sepa^at. p. 170.
Robinson grants. 4. This should evert all judicatories of peace and war, so
many thousands, Acts 2. could not be present at every act of censure and that
daily, nor are acts o^ Discipline necessarily tied to the Lord's Day They are (I
grant) acts of Divine worship, but the whole multitude of women and children
are deprived of the liberty that God has given them for six days to the works
of their calling, if they must be personally present, at all the acts of
Discipline, to cognosce of all scandals, and to here and receive Testimonies
against Elders under two or three witnesses, which is the office of Timothy ^
Tim. 5. ^^.
this way the overseeing of the manners of the people, which also our Brethren
lay upon the whole people, takes up the great part of the Pastors office, and
the whole office of ruling Elders. And if we lay upon the people the work and
all the acts of the office, how can we not lay upon them the office it self?
5. All Israel gathered to war, from Dan to Beersheba, could not, by virtue of
duty and obligation, be present personally at the determination of lawful War:
Nay if they were all present, as Judges, as Ains. loc. cit.
Mr. Ainsworth would have them, there be no Governors and Feeders in Israel,
but all the governed are Feeders, and so no Magistrate and Ruler, as
Anabaptists teach here. 1. It were not lawful for one to be King over more
people, then he could in his own personal presence judge, contrary to Gods
Word, that teaches us to obey these who are sent by the supreme Magistrate, as
we obey the King, 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. Ergo, these who are sent by him are lawful
Judges, and yet the King Judges by them, and in them. 2. This error is founded
upon a worse error, to wit, that the supreme Magistrate had no power of life
and death in Israel, without consent of the people, but certainly there are as
specious and plausible reasons, if not more specious, for the peoples
government in all civil matters, then there can be for their Churchpower of
judging in the Church Matters, and government thereof. Yet there is no ground
for it. 1. Because the Rulers only could not be charged, to execute judgment
in the morning, to deliver the oppressed, to execute judgment for the
Fatherless and the Widow, nor can there be a promise made to establish, the
Kings Throne for obeying that Commandment, as (a) Gods Jer. 22. 3, 4, 5. Deuteronomy.
17. 18, 19, 20. 1 Ki. 11. 38. 39. Isa. 1. 22. 23.
Word teaches; if the people have as great, yea, greater power in Judging,
then the Rulers have by this our Brethrens argument. They say all the Believers
at Corinth. 1 Cor. 5. could not be commanded to cast out the incestuous person,
nor could they all be taxed for omitting that duty, if they had not power to
excommunicate. 2. Neither can the Spirit of God complaint that the Judges
builded Zion with blood, and the heads of the house of Jacob, and Princes of
the house of Israel did abhor judgment and pervert equity as the Prophets say,
Micah. 3. 9, 10. 11.
nor could they be condemned as roaring Lions and evening Wolves, as the
Prophet says: for the Judge^ might well be faultlesse, when the poor were
crushed in the Gate, and Judgment turned into Gall and Wormwood, because they
cannot help the matter, the people are the greatest part in caring matters in
judgment. 2. We see Zeph. 3. 3.
David's practice in condemning the Amalckite out of his own confession, not
asking the peoples consent, and in condemning to death 2 Samuel 1. 15
Baanah and Rehab, for killing Ishbosheth. Solomon gave sentence 2 Samuel 4. 8.
12.
against Adoniiah, Ioab, Shimei, without consent of the people, David pardoned
Shimei contrary to the counsel of Zerviahs sons. 3. If from the peoples
witnessing and hearing of judgment in the Gate, we conclude the people were
Judges, with the Rulers, there was never a time, when there was no King in
Israel, and no Judge to put evil doers to shame, but every man did what seemed
good in his own Eyes, contrary to Scripture 1 Ki. 2.
because all are a generation of Kings and Princes no less then the Ruler
himself, as Anabaptists teach. By the Doctrine of Jud. 18. 1. v. 7.
our brethren I deny not but he that gathered sticks on the Sabbath was
brought, Number. 15. 33. to Moses and to Aaron and to all the Congregation, but
the Congregation signifies not the common multitude. For 35. Moses received
the sentence from God and pronounced it, and the Congregation stoned him to
death, And Numb. 27. 1. The Daughters of Zelophehad stood before Moses,
Eleazar, and before the Princes as Judges, and before all the Congregation, as
witnesses, not as Judges: but v. 6. 7. Moses gave out the judicial sentence,
from the Lords mouth. And 1 King. 21. 12. Naboth stood in presence of the
people to be judged, but the Nobles and Princes were his Judges, because v. 8.
Iezabel wrote to the Nobles and Princes that v. 10. they should carry out
Naboth and stone him, to wit, judicially, and v. 11. The Nobles and Princes did
as Iezabel had sent unto them. And Jeremiah cap. 26. pleaded his cause before
the Princes and people, for v. 10. The Princes.

(...)
Set down (judicially) in the entry of the new gate of the Lords House, nothing
can be gathered from the place to prove that the people judged, but because
Jeremiah spoke to the Princes and the people who verse. 24: were in a fury and
rage against Jeremiah, if Ahikam had not saved him from their violence.

CHAP. 4. SECT. 4. QUEST. 5.
WHether there be no national or provincial Church under the New Testament,
but only a parishionall Congregation meeting every Lords day, in one place for
the worship of God?

The Author, in this first proposition denies that there is any National or
provincial Church, at all, under the New Testament, for clearing of the
question observe these.

1. Did. We deny that there is any diocescan, provincial or National Church
under the care of one Diocesan or National Prelate or Bishop, but hence it
follows not, there is no visible instituted Church now, but only a particular
Congregation.

2. Did. We deny any National typical Church, where a whole Nation is tied
to one public worship, in one place, as sacrificing in the Temple.

3. Did. We deny not but the most usual acception of a Church, or visible
meeting is given, as the (...) cont. Tylen. parenes. l. 1. c. 25. sect. 4. and
5.
refutator of Tylenus says, to a convention of people meeting ordinarily to
hear the word and adminstrate the Sacraments Steph. in Thesau.
Stephanus deriveth it from (...). And Cyrill. Hyerosolamita.
Cyrillus (...). As Causab. cont. Baron. 6. 42.
Causabon observes; so these who meet at one Sermon are called Ecclesia, a
Church, and it is called Ecclesia and concio, says the Refutator of Tilen,
Loc. cit.
but this hinders not the Union of more particular Congregations, in their
principal members for Church Government, to be the meeting or Church
representative of these many united Congregations.

4. Did. A Parish Church material, is a Church within such local bounds, the
members whereof dwell contiguously togegether, one bordering on the other, our
Brethren, mean not of such a Church; for as Baynes diocesan trial. q. 1. p.
12.
Pa^^ Baynes says well this God instituted not, because a company of Papists
and Protestants may thus dwell together, as in a Parish, and yet they axe of
contrary Churches, a Parish Church formally is a multitude who meet in manner
or form of a Parish, as if they dwelt near together in a place ordinarily, to
worship God, as the (...) of those who came together to celebrate the Lords
Supper, is called the Church, 1 Cor. 11. 18. For first of all when ye come
together in the Church, I hear that there are divisions amongst you. (...)
what? have ye not houses to eat and drink in? or despise ye the Church of God?

1. Concl. If we shall evince a Church-visible in the Now Testament which is
not a Parishionall Church, we evince this to be false which is maintained by
our Brothren, that there is no visible instituted Church in the New Testament
save only a Parishionall Church, or a single independent Congregation. But
this Church we conceive to have been no Parishionall Church. 1. Because these
who met daily and continued with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread
from house to house, that is, administrating the Sacraments together as our
Brethren say, were a visible Church. But these being first an hundred and
twenty, as Acts 1. and then three thousand added to them, Acts 2. 41. could not
make all one single independent Congregation, whereof all the members had voice
in actual government* Ergo, they were a visible instituted Church, and yet not
a Parishionall Church. The proposition is clear, The Church of Jerusalem was
one visible Church, and did exercise together a visible act of government, in
sending messengers to (...) Acts 15. 22. Then pleased it the Apostles and
Elders and the whole Church (our Brethren say, the whole collective Church Men,
Women, and Children at Jerusalem) to send men of their own company to Antioch
23. And wrote Letters, and some Decrees and Commandments to be observed. Now
the many thousands of the Church of Jerusalem, by no possibility could meet a^
one Parish, in one material house to administrate the Lords Supper: far
less could they be, as is said; Acts 2. 42. all continuing steadfastly in the
Apostles Doctrine and followship (our Brethren say in P^rishionall or
Congregationall fellowship) and in breaking of bread and prayer, nor could they
daily continue in the Temple and break bread from house to house, being all
one Church, or a fixed parishionall meeting in one material house. Now it is
clear, they were (...) even after they exceeded many thousands in number, in
one Parishionall and Congregationall government, as our Brethren would prove
from Acts 15, 22, 23, 24, 25. And Acts 2. 42, 43. Else how could they have all
their goods common, if there be not one visible government amongst them? but
this government could not be of one single Congregation; for all who sold their
goods, and had all things common, could not meet to give voices in Discipline,
a judicatory of so many thousand Judges were impossible and ridiculous.

2. Paul writes to the Galatians, where there were many Parish, Churches, Gal.
1. 2. as our Brethren teach, yet does he write to them, as he does to the
Corinthians: where our Brethren will have one Parish- Church, and writes to
them of uniformity of visible government, that they meet not together to keep
days, Sabbaths, and years Gal. 4. 10. as the Jews did, that they keep not
Jewish and ceremonial meetings, and conventions, Gal. 4. 9. these Churches are
called one lump in danger to be leavened, as Corinth is a Parishionall lump
in hazard to be leavened, as our Brethren teach. Now how could Paul will 1 Cor.
5.
them that the whole lump of all the Churches and Congregations in Galatia, be
not leavened, except he lay down a ground, that they were with united authority
to join in one visible government, against the false Teachers: suppose there
were twenty sundry Kings in Britain, and twenty Kingdoms, could our friends
over Sea write to us as to one National lump, to beware of the Spanish
faction, except they laid down this ground, that all the twenty little
Kingdoms, had some visible union in Government, and might with joint authority
of all the twenty Kingdoms concur to resist the common Enemy?

Here that godly and learned Divine Mr. Baynes says, Communion in government
is not enough to make them one Church, this (says he) Paul Baynes dioces.
trial. q. 1. p. 13. ib. p. 11.
makes them rather one in tertio quodam separabili ( in a third thing which
may be separated) then one Church; Government being a thing that comes to a
Church now constituted, and may be absent, the Church remaning a Church, I
answer this is a good reason against the Prelates Diocese^n Church, which, as
Baynes says well, is such a frame in which many Churches are united with one
head- Church (under one Lord prelate, common Pastor to all the Pastors and
particular Congregations of the Diocese) as part aching of holy things, or at
least in that power of government, which is in the chief, Church, for all the
others within such a circuit. Now the prel^tes frame of a properly so called
Church, under one Pastor being a Creature with a hundred heads, having Church
and pastoral care of a hundred little Congregations and Churches, is a dream,
for we know no such Church fed by a Prelate, nor no such prelaticall Argos to
oversee so many flocks; nor do we contend that the many Congregations united
in a presbyteriall government, do make a mystical visible Church meeting for
all the Ordinances of God. But union of many Congregations in a visible
government is enough to make all these united Churches one visible,
ministerial and governing Church who may meet, not in one collective body,
for the worship of God; yet in one representative body, for government: though
worship may be in such a convened Church also, as we shall hear. The name of
the Church I think is given to such a meeting, Mat. 18. 17. Acts 15. 22.
though more usually in Scripture the Church is a fixed Congregation, convened
for Gods worship: now government is an accident separable, and may go and come
to a mystical Church; but I think it is not so to a Ministerial governing
Church. So the Church of Ephesus is called a Church in the singular number,
Rev. 2. 1. and all the Churches of Asia, Rev. 1. 20. but seven Churches; and
Christ directs seven Epistles to these seven, and writes to Ephesus as to a
Church having one government, v. 2. Thou have tried them which say they are
Apostles and are not, and have found them liars. This was Ecclesiastical
trial by Church Discipline, yet Ephesus contained more particular
Congregations then one. 1. Because Christ speaking to Ephesus only, says, v.
7. He that has an Ear^ to hear let him hear what the spirit says unto the
Churches, in the plural number 2. Because there were a good number of
preaching Elders in Ephesus, Acts 20. 28. 36. 37. and it is incongruous to Gods
dispensation to send a multiude of pastors, to over see ordinarily one single
and independent Congregation. 3. This I have proved from the huge multitudes
converted to the Faith in Ephesus, so huge and populous a City where many Jews
and Greeks dw^l^, and where the Word of God grew so migh^^ly, Acts 19. 17, 18,
19, 20. and Christ writes to every one of the seven Churches as to one, and
yet exhorts seven times in every Epistle, that Churches in the plural number
hear what the spirit says. Now as our Brethren prove that the Churches of
Galatia, so called in the plural number, were many particular Churches, so do
we borrow this argument, to prove that every one of the seven Churches, who are
seven times called Church in the plural number, contained many Congregations
under them, yet does. Christ write to every one of the seven, as having one
visible Government.

2. Concl. A national typical Church^ was the Church of the Jews, we deny.
But a Church national or provincial of Cities, Provinces, and Kingdoms,
having one common government, we think cannot be denied: so Paul Baynes cites
for this, 1 Pet. 1. 1. 1 Pet. 5. 2. Though we take not the Word Church for a my
sticall body, but for a ministerial company. But Acts 1. Matthias was elected
an Apostle by the Church, as our Brethren confess, but not by a particular
Congregation who met every Lord's Day, and in ordinary to partake of all the
holy things of God, the Word and Sacraments. 1. Here were the Apostles, whose
Parish- Church was the whole World, Mat. 28. 19. Go teach all Nations 2. In
this Church were the brethren of Christ from Galilee, Acts 1. 14. and some from
Jerusalem v. 15. 3. No particular Church had power Ecclesiastical, as this
Church had power to choose an Apostle, who was to be a Pastor over the Churches
of the whole World, as our brethren teach, so Paget defense of Church
government Chap. 6.
Mr. Paget says well; These Disciples who waited upon Christ, such as Barsabas
and Matthias, were no members of the Church of Jerusalem, and so what power had
a particular Church to dispose of them, who were no members of their Church? 3.
That which concerns all, must be done by all, and that which concerns the
feeding and governing of the Church of the whole World, must be done by these
who represent the Church of the whole World; but that Matthias should be
chosen, and ordained an Apostle to teach to the whole World, concerned all the
Churches, and not one particular Church (...), Therefore there was here either
no Church (which no man dare say) for ^here is here a company of believers
where there is preaching and Church*government, v. 15. 16. 26. or then there
was here a Congregation which is against sense and Scripture; or there is a
Church Provincial, Natural, or Oecumenick; call it as you please, it is a
visible Church instituted in the New Testament, after the ascension of Christ,
and not a Parishionall Church. Some answer, this was extraordinary and merely
Apostolic, that an Apostle should be ordained, and is no warrant for a
national Church now, when the Churches of Christ are constituted. But I
answer, this distinction of ordinary and extraordinary is wearied and worn to
death with two much employment. 2. Beza, Calvin, Piscator, Tilenus, Whittaker,
Chamier, Pareus, Bucanus, professors of Leyden, Walaeus, Willet, P. Martyr,
Ursinus, etc. and all our Divines, yea Lorin. comment in act.
Lorinus the J^suite, Cajetan com. ^b.
Cajetan, allege this place with good reason to prove, that the ordination and
election of Pastors belongs to the whole Church, and not to one man, Peter,
or any Pope. Yea Robin justi. p. 168, 169.
Robinson and all our Brethren, use this place, to prove, that the Church to
the second coming of Christ has power to ordain, and exanthorate and censure
her officers. 2. We desire a ground for this, that the Ecclesiastical power of
the Church which is ordinary and perpetual to Christ's second coming, should
join as a coll^terall cause in ordination and election of an Apostle* which
ordination is extraordinary, temporary and apostolic; see for this Pet. Martyr

Irenaeus speaks against rectifiers of the Apostles in this Cyprian l. 2.
Epist. 4.
Cyprian says the like, 2 Acts 6. A Church of Hebrews and Graecians, together
with the twelve Apostles is not a particular Ordinary Congregation, and a
governing Church choosing Deacons, therefore they are a national Church;
though the first ordination of Deacons be merely Apostolic, and immediately
from Jesus Christ, yet the ordination of these seven persons was a work of the
Churches power of the keys. Now let our Brethren speak, if this was a
Congregationall Church, that meets ordinarily to the word and Sacraments,
such as they say the Church of Corinth was, 1 Cor. ^1. 18. So say I of the
Church, Acts 15. 22. called Apostles, Elders and Brethren and the whole Church,
this could not be a particular Church; for no particular Congregation has
Ecclesiastical power to prescribe Decrees, and Canons to all the Churches of
the Gentiles, and that this was done by an ordinary Ecclesiastic power that
remains perpetually in a Church, such as this was, is clear, because our
Brethren prove that the whole multitude spoke in this Church from verse. 12.
Then all the multitude kept silence, and therefore the multitude (say our
Brethren) spoke from v. 21. all the Church voyced in these Decrees and Canons,
say they.

3. Sister Churchers keep a visible Church Communion together. 1. They hear
the word, and partake of the Seals of the Covenant, occasionally one with
another. 2. They eschew the same excommunicated heretic, as a common
Church-enemy to all. 3. They exhort, rebuke comfort, and edify one another, as
members of one body visible. 4. If one sister Church fall away, they are to
labor to gain her, and if she will not be gained, as your Author says Way of
the Church of Chin N. E. c. 6. sect. 1.
they tell it to many sister Churches, if she refilse to hear them. they
forsake Communion with her. 1. Here is a visible body of Christ, and his
Spouse, having right to the keys, word and seals of grace. 2. Here is a
visible body exercising visible acts of Church Fellowship one toward another.
Hence here a visible Provincial, and National Church exercising the specific
acts of a Church. Ergo, Here is a Provincial and National Church. For to whom
that agrees which essentially constituteth a Church visible, that must be a
visible Church. You will say, they are not a visible Church because they
cannot, and do not ordinarily all meet in one material house, to hear one
and the same word of God, and to partake of the same Seals of the Covenant
jointly: but I answer 1. This is a begging of the question. 2. They perform
other specific acts of a visible Church, then to meet ordinarily, to partake
jointly, and at once, of the same ordinances. 3. If this be a good reason that
they cannot be a National Church, because they meet not all ordinarily to
hear the some word, and to partake of the same Ordinances, then a local and
visible and ordinary union jointly in the same worship, is the specific
essence of a visible Church; but then there was no visible National Churches
in Judea, for it was impossible that they could all meet in one material
house, to partake of the same worship. 4. These who for sickness and necessary
avocations of their calling, as Navigation, Traffiquing and the like, cannot
ordinarily meet with the congregation to partake jointly with them of these same
Ordinances, loose all membership of the visible Church, which is absurd; for
they are cast out for no fault. 5. This is not essential to a national
Church, that they should ordinarily all jointly meet for the same worship, but
that they be united in one ministerial government, and meet in their chief
members, and therefore our Brethren use an argument, a specie ad gen^s
negative; a provincial or national company of believers cannot perform the
acts of a particular visible Church; Ergo, such a company is not a visible
Church, just as if I would reason thus: A Horse cannot laugh; Ergo, he is not a
living Creature, or it is an argument a negatione unius speciei, ad negationem
alterius, such a company is not such a congregationall Church, Ergo, it is no
visible Church at all; an Ape is not a reasonable Creature. Ergo, it is not an
Ape.

3. Conclu. There ought to be a fellowship of Church communion amongst all the
visible Churches on Earth; Ergo de jure and by Christ his institution there is
an universal or catholic visible Church. I prove the antecedent. 1. Because
there ought to be mutual fellowship of visible Church-duties, as where there
is one internal fellowship, because Ephesians. 4. 4. we are one body, one spirit,
even as we are called in one hope of our calling, v. 5. one Lord, on Father,
one Baptism, v. 6. one God, and Father of all. There also should there be
external fellowship, and Church- fellowship, of exhorting, rebuking,
comforting, and Church-praying, and Church-praising, in the behalf of all the
visible Churches on earth, even for those, whose faces we never saw, Coloss. 2.
1. and when one national Church falls away, the visible Churches of the
Christian world are obliged to rebuke, and to labor to gain such a Church,
and if she will not be gained, to renounce all the foresaid communion with such
an obstinate Nation. 2. As the Apostles had one public care of all the
Churches, and accordingly kept visible fellowship, as they had occasion to
preach, write to them, pray, and praise God for them, so this care as
Apostolic I grant is gone and dead with the Apostles; but the pastoral and
Church-care, and consequently acts of external fellowship are not dead with
the Apostles, but are left in the Church of Christ, for what Church Communion
of visible fellowship members of one particular congregation keep one with
another, that same by due proportion, ought national Churches to keep amongst
themselves. 3. This is clear Act. 1. where particular Churches with the
Apostles did meet, and take care to provide a Pastor and an Apostle, Matthias,
for the whole Christian Church, and why ^ut particular Churches, are hereby
taught to confer all Church Authority that God has given them, for the rest of
the visible Churches; and the Churches conuened in their special members, Acts
15. 12. extended their Church-care, in a Church Communion of Ecclesiastic
canons to all the visible Churches of the Jews and Gentiles. Hence Oecumenick
and general counsels should be jure divino, to the second coming of Christ;
Neither need we stand much on this that our Brethren say, that one Catholic
visible Church is a night dream, because no Church is visible save only a
particular congregation, the external communion whereof in meeting in one
material house ordinarily, and partaking of the same word and Sacraments, does
incur in our senses, whereas a Church communion and visible fellowship with
the whole Christian Churches on Earth is impossible, and no ways visible. But
I answer, if such a part of the Sea, the British Sea be visible, then are all
the Seas on earth visible also, though they cannot all come in one man's senses
at one and the same time; so if this Church particular be visible, then all the
Churches also in their kind are visible. 2. There be acts of Church Communion
external with all the visible Churches on earth, Ergo, the whole Catholic
Church according to these acts is visible. I prove the antecedent, we pray in a
Church Way publicly for all the visible Churches on earth, we praise
Church-wayes publicly for them, we fast and are humbled Church-wayes before
God when they are in trouble, and so ought they to do with us; we by
preaching, writing, and Synodicall constitutions proclaim the common enemy of
all the Churches to be the Antichrist, his doctrine and the doctrine of that
body whereof he is Head to be false and heretical, by writings we call all the
people of God to come out of Bab^l, and we renounce external communion with
Rome, in Doctrine, Discipline, Ceremonies: and Rites, all which are Church-acts
of external communion with the reformed catholic visible Churches, neither to
make a Church visible to us, is it requisi^e that we should see the faces of
all the members of the Catholic visible Church, and be in one material Church
with them at once, partaking of the same visible worship: yea, so the Church of
Judea should not be one visible Church, which our Brethren must deny, for they
had one Priest hood, on Temple, one Covenant of God visibly professed by all;
yet could they not all meet in one material Temple to partake together at
once of all Gods O dinance^. For I partake in external worship with these of
New England, who are baptized according to Christ's institution, without the
sign of the cross, though I never saw their faces. Hence all may see that
Oecumenick councel's are de jure and Christ's lawful Ordinances, though de
facto they be not, through the corruption of our nature; yet such a visible
Church Fellowship in external Church Communion is kept in the whole catholics
Church visible, as may be had, considering the perversity of men, and the
malice of Satan.

It is constantly denied by our brethren, that the Church of the Jews was a
congregationall Church, and of that frame and institution with the Christian
Church: but that it was peculiar and merely in laicall to be a national
Church; yet let me have liberty to offer a necessary distinction here. 1. a
national Church is either when a whole Nation, and all the Congregations and
Synogogues thereof are tied by Divine precept, to some public acts of
typical worship, in one place, Which the Lord has chosen; so all Israel were
to sacrifice at Jerusalem only, and the Priests were to officiate in that
kind, there only, and they to pray toward the Temple, or in the Temple, and
they to present the male children there, as holy to the Lord, Luke 2. 23 etc.
this way indeed the Church of the Jews, in a peculiar manner, was a National
Church; and thus far our brethrens arguments do well conclude, that the
Jewish Church was National in a peculiar manner proper to that Church only.
But a National Church is taken in another sense now, for a people to whom the
Lord has revealed his statutes and his testimonies, Whereas he has not d alt
so with every Nation, Psalm. 147. 19, 20. which Church is also made up of many
Congregations and Synagogues, having one worship and government that does
morally concern them all. Thus the Jewish Church was once National, and that
for a time; God chose them of his free grace, to be a people to himself, Deuteronomy.
7. 7. and Deuteronomy. 32. 8. When the most high divided to the Nations their
inheritance. Jacob was the lot of his inheritance, Amos 3. 2. You only have I
chosen of all the families of the earth. But the Jewish Church was in this
sense but National for a time; Now has God (Act. 11. v. 18.) also granted to
the Gentiles repentance unto life, and called the Gentiles, and made them a
National Church, Hos. 1. 11. 1 Pet. 2. 10, 11. Esaias 54. 1, 2, 3. that is, he
has revealed his testimonies to England, to Scotland, and He has not done so
to every Nation. So if a false Teacher should go through Israel and call
himself the power of God, as Simon Magus did. All the Congreations and
Synagogues in Israel might join together to condemn him; if there were such a
thing as an Arc in Scotland, if it were taken captive as the Prelates kept the
Gospel in bonds, it were a moral duty to all the Congregations, to convene
in their principal Rulers and Pastors to bring again the Ark of God, and by
the power of Discipline to set it free; and if the whole Land were involved in
a National apostacy, they are to meet in their principal members, and this
is moral to Scotland, as to Israel by Ordinances of the Church to renew a
Covenant with God, that his wrath may be turned off the Land. In this sense, we
see it never proved, that it was peculiar to Israel, only to be a National
Church.

Nay, I affirm, that the Jews had their Congregationall Churches, as we have.
For that is a Congregationall Church which meets, (...) in that same place,
for Doctrine and Discipline. But the Jews meet every Sabbath in their
Synagogues, for teaching the people, Gods Law, and for Discipline. Ergo, the
people of the Jews had their Congregationall Churches, as we have. The major
proposition is the doctrine of our brethren, except they say, (as its like they
must) that except they meet to pa^take of all the Ordinances of God, they are
not a Congregationall Church. Yet truly this is but a knot in a Rush, for 1
Cor. 14 meeting for prophesying only, is a Church Convention; and the
forbidding of women to teach in the Church, is an ordering of a Congregationall
worship; and the meeting of the Church for baptising of Infants, is in the mind
of our brethren the formal meeting of a Congregationall Church, though they
should not celebrate the Lords Supper. 2. What Ecclesiastical meetings can the
meeting of Gods people be, in the Synagogues of God, as they are called* Psalm.
74. 8 for hearing the Word, and for exercise of Discipline, if not the Church
meeting in a Congregation? I prove the assumption by parts, and first I take it
to be undeniable, that they did meet for doctrine, Act. 15. 21. For Moses of
old time has in every City them that preach him, being read in the Synag^g^e
every Sabbath day. And Ps. 74. 8, 9. these two are jointly complained of, as a
great desolation in the Church, the burning of Gods Synagogues in the Land. And
v. 8. that there are no Prophets which know how long. And Math. 9. 35. Christ
went about all Cities and Villages teaching in their Synagogues. Luke 4 16. He
went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read, Math. 6. 2.
And when the Sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the Synagogue; and many
hearing him were astonished. Luke 6. 6. And it came to pass, another Sabbath
day, he entered into the Synagogue and taught. John 18. 20. I ever taught in
the Synagogues, and daily in the Temple whither the Jews always resort. Math.
13. 54. And when he was come into his own^ Country, he taught them in their
Synagogue, in as much as they were astonished. And that there was ruling and
government in the Synagogue, is clear, 1, by their Rulers of the Synagogue,
Act. 13. 15. Act. 18. 17. 8. Luke 13. 14. Mark 5. 22. 35. And if this Ruler
had been any save a Moderator, if he had been an unlawful Officer, Christ
would not have acknowledged him, nor would Paul, at the desire of the Rulers of
the Synagogue have preached, as he does, Acts 13. 15, 16. 2. Also, if there was
teaching cisputing, concerning the Law in the Synagogue, there behooved to be
some ordering of these acts of worship; for only approved Prophets were
licensed to preach in their Synagogues, to say nothing that there was beating
in the Synagogues, and therefore there behoved to be Church discipline. Hence
that word of delivering up to the Synagogue. Luke 21. 12. 3. There was the
censure of excommunication, and casting out of the Synagogue, and a cutting off
from the Congregation. Hence that act of casting out of the Synagogue any who
should confess Jesus. John 12. 42. which they executed on the blind man, John
9. 34. It is true, our brethren deny that there was any excommunication in the
Church of the Jews, and they allege, that the cutting off from the people of
God, was a taking away of the life by the Magistrates Sword; or, (as some other
say) Gods immediate hand of judgment upon them. But 1. to be cut off from the
congregation, or from the people of God, is never called simply off-cutting,
and expounded to be destroying, as it is Genes. 9. 11. but expressed by dying
the death: for who will conceive that the Sword of the Magistrate was to cut
off the male child that is not circumcised, who is said to be cut off from the
people of God, Genesis 17. 14. or to cut off by death the parents? I grant the
phrase signifies bodily death. Exodus 31. 14. and for this God sought to kill
Moses. But Divines say it was excommunication, and never Ruler in Israel
executed this sentence: not Moses, nor any Judge that ever we read took away
the life of an infant for the omission of a ceremony. Nor are we to think,
that for eating leavened bread in the time of the Passover, the Magistrate was
to take away the life, as is said. Levit. 7. 20, 21. 2. ^his word, to cut off,
is expounded, 1 Cor. 5. to put away; which was not by death, for he wills
them, 2 Cor. 2. to pardon him, and confirm their love to him. 2. Neither could
Paul rebuke the Corinthians because Gods hand had not miraculously taken him
away, or because the Magistrate had not taken away his life, which was not the
Corinthians fault. 3. I am persuaded, to be cast out of the Synagogue, was not
to be put to death, because Ioh. 9. the blind man after he is cast out of the
Synagogue, Jesus meets with him in the Temple, and he believes and
confesses Christ, and Christ Ioh. 16. distingusheth them clearly, They shall
kill you, and beside that, (...). They shall excommunicate you. But though it
were granted, t^^t the Jewish Church used not excommunication had they no
Ecclesiastical censures before for that? I think it does not follow; for the
excluding of the Leper, that these who touched the dead were legally unclean,
and might not eat the Passover, were censures, but they were not civil; Ergo,
Ecclesiastical they must be, as to be excluded from the Lords Supper is a
mere. Ecclesiastical censure in the Christian Church. Also if Pastors and
Preachers be complained of, that not only at Jerusalem, but every where,
through all the land, they strengthened not the ^^ eased sheep; They did not
bind up the broken, nor bring again the loosed, but with force and cruclty
they did govern, Ezekiel. 34. 4. and if every where, the Prophets did prophecy
falsely, and the Priests bare rule by their means, and the people loved to
have it so. Jer. 5. 31. Then in Synagogues there was Church Government, as at
^erusalem; for where the Lord rebukes any sin, he does recommend the
contrary duty. Now Prophets and Priests are rebuked, tor their ruling with
force and rigor every where, and not at Jerusalem only, for that they were
not compassionate to carry the Lambs in their bosom, as Jesus Christ does,
Esai. 40. 11. their ill government every where must be condemned. 3. Luke 4.
16. Christ, as his custom was, went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day;
Paul and Barnabas were requested, to exhort in the Synagogue, as the order was,
that Prophets at the direction of the Rulers of the Synagogue, if they had any
word of exhortation, they should speak, and consequently their order was that
every one should not speak; Ergo, they had customs and orders of
Church Discipline to the which Christ and his Apostles did submit themselves,
And to tie all Churchgovernment to the Temple of Jerusalem were to say, God had
ordained his people elsewhere to worship him publicly, but without any order,
and that Christ and his Apostles subjected themselves to an unjust order.

I further argue thus. Those Churches be of the same nature, frame, and
essential Constiutions, which agree in the same essentials, and diff^r only in
accidents; but such are the Church of the Jews, and the Christian Churches;
Ergo, what is the frame and essential consti^^tion of the one Church, must be
the frame and essential constitution of the other. Ergo, etc. the major is of
undeniable certainty. I prove the assumption. These which have the same Faith,
and the same external profession of Faith, these have the same frame and
essential constitution, but they and we be such Churches; for we have the same
covenant of grace, Jer. 31. 31. Jer. 32. 39 40. Heb 8. 8, 9 10. Therefore that
same faith, differing only in accidents: their faith did look to Christ to be
incarnate, and our faith to that same very God now manifested in the flesh.
Heb. 13. 8. They were saved by faith, as we are, Heb. 11. Acts 10. 42, 43.
Acts. 11. 16, 17, 18. and consequently, what visible profession of faith does
constitute the one visible Church, does constitute the other. I know, Papists,
Arminians, Socinians do make the Doctrine, and Seals of the Jewish and
Christian Church much different, but against the truth of Scripture.

The only answer that can be made to this, must be, that though the Church of
the Jews wanted not congregations, as our Christian Churches have, yet were
they a national Church of another essential, visible frame, then are the
Christian Churches, because they had positive, typical, and ceremonial and
carnal commandments that they should have one high Priest for the whole
national Church, the Christian Churches have not for that, one visible Monarch
and Pope; they had an Altar, Sacrifices, and diverse pollutions ceremonial,
which made persons incapable of the Passover; but we have no such legal
uncleanness, which can make us incapable of the Seals of the New Testament:
and therefore it was not lawful to separate from the Jewish Church, in which
did sit a typical High Priest, where were Sacrifices, that did adumbrate the
Sacrifice of our great High Priest, and c. not withstanding of scandalous
persons in that Church; because there was but one visible Church, out of which
was to come the Redeemer Christ, according to the flesh, but the Christian
Churches under the New Testament, be of another frame, Christ not being tied to
one Nation, or place, or Congregation: therefore if any one Congregation want
the Ordinances of Christ, we may separate therefrom, to another Mount Sion,
seeing there be so many Mount Sions no^.

Answ. 1. If the Church of the Jews was a visible Church in its essential
constitution different from our visible Churches, because they were under the
Religions tie of so me carnal, ceremonial, and typical mandats and
Ordinances, that we are not under, then do I infer, that the Tribe of Levy
was not one visible Church, in the essential frame, with the rest of the
Tribes, which is absurd, for that Tribe containing the Priests and Levites, was
under the obligatory tie of many typical Commandments proper and peculiar to
them only, as to offer Sacrifices, to wash themselves, when they were to
officiate, to wear linen Ephods, to bear the Arc of the Covenant, now it
was sin for any that were not of the Sons of Aaron, or of another Tribe to
perform these duties; yet, I hope, they made but one national Church with the
rest of the Tribes. Secondly, I infer, that the Christian Church that now is,
cannot be of that same essential frame with the Apostolic Churches, because
the Apostolic Church, so long as the Jewish ceremonies were indifferent, ( in
statu (...)) and mortal, but not mortiferae, deadly, was to practice these
ceremonies, in the case of scandal, 1 Cor. 10. 31, 32, 33. and yet the
Christian Church that now is, can in no sort practice these ceremonies: yea, I
infer that the Eldership of a Congregation does not make one Church of one
and the same essential frame and constitution with the people, because the
Elders be under an obligatory tie to some positive Divine Commandments, such
as are to administer the Seals, Baptism and the Lords Supper, and yet the
multitude of Believeres, in that same congregation, are under no such tie; and
certainly if to be under ceremonial and typical ordinances does institute the
whole Jewish Church in another essential frame different from the Christian
Churches, reason would say that then, if the members of one Church be under
Divine positive commandments, which does in no sort tie other members of the
same Church, that then there be diverse memberships of different essential
frames in one and the same Church, which to me is monstrous; for then, because
a command is given to Abraham to offer his son Isaak to God, and no such
command is given to Sarah, in that case Abraham and Sarah shall not be members
of one and the same visible Church. But the truth is, different positive
commandments of ceremonial and typical ordinances put ^o new essential frame
of a visible Church upon the Jewish Church, which is not on the Christian
Churches. These were only accidental characters and temporary cognizances to
distinguish the Jewish and Christian Churches, while as both agree in one and
the same moral constitution of visible Churches: for first, both had the same
faith, one Lord, one covenant, one Jesus Christ, the same seals of the
covenant in substance, both were visibly to profess the same Religion; the
differences of externals made not them and us different visible Churches, nor
can our brethren say, they made different bodies of Christ, different Spouses,
different royal Generations, as concerning Church-frame. Yet are we not tied
to their high Priest, to their Altars, Sacrifices, Holy days, Sabbaths, new
Moons, etc. no more then any one private Christian in such a congregation, or
a believing woman is tied to preach and baptize; and yet her pastor Archippus,
in that congregation, is tied both to preach and baptize. Secondly, the Jews
were to separate from B thaven, and so are we. Thirdly, they were not to join
with Idolaters in Idol-worship, neither are we.

2 Whereas it is said that it was not lawful to separate from the Jewish
Church, because in it did sit the typical high Priest, and the Messiah was to
be borne in it, and because they were the only Church on earth; but now there
be many particular Churches. All this is a deception, a non causi^ pro causa,
for separation from that Church was not forbidden for any typical or
ceremonial reason, not a shadow of reason can be given from the Word of God
for this: Because there can be no ceremonial argument why there should be
communion betwixt light and darkness, or any concord betwixt Christ and
Belial, or any comparting betwixt the believer and the infidel, or any
agreement of the temple of God with idols, nor any reason typical why Gods
people should go to Gilgal, and to Bethaven, or to be joined with idols, or
why a David should sit with vain persons, or go in to dissemblers, or why he
should offer the drink offerings of these who hasten after a strange god, or
take up their names in his mouth. This is then an unwritten tradition; yea, if
Dagon had been brought into the Temple, as the Assy^ian altar of Damascus was
set up in the holy place, the people ^ught to have separated from Temple and
Sacrifices both, so long as that abomination should stand in the holy place:
Nor can it be proved, that communicating with the Church of Israel as a member
thereof; was typical and necessary to make up visible membership, as
ceremonial holiness is; for to adhere to the Church in a sound worship,
though the fellow-worshippers be scandalous, is a moral duty commanded in the
second Commandment; as to forsake Church Assemblies is a moral breach of that
Commandment, and forbidden to Christians, Hebr. 10. 25. who are under no Law of
Ceremonies. And it is an untruth, that those who were legally clean, and not
ceremonially polluted, were members of the Jewish visible Church, though
otherwise they were most flagitious: For to God they were no more his visible
Israel then Sodom and Gomorrah, Isaiah 1. 10. or the children of Ethiopia,
Amos 9. 7. and are condemned of God, as sinning against the profession of their
visible incorporation in the Israel of God, Jerem. 7. 4, 5, 6, 7. But shall we
name and repute them brethren, whom in conscience we know to be as ignorant and
void of grace, as any Pagan? I answer, That if they profess the truth, though
they walk inordinately, yea, and were excommunicated, Paul wills us to
admonish them as brethren, 2 These. 3. 15. and calls all the visible Church of
Corinth (for he writes to good and bad) amongst whom were many partakers of
the table of devils, pleaders with their brethren before heathen, deniers of
the resurrection, yea those to whom the Gospel was hidden, 2 Cor. 4. brethren
and Saints by calling.

But (say our brethren) to be cast out of the Jewish Church, was to be cast out
of the Commonwealth; as to be a member of the Church, and to be a member of
the state is all one, because the state of the Jews and the Church of the Jews
was all one; and none is said to be cut off from the people, but he was put to
death.

Answ. Surely Esaias 66. verse. 5. these who are cast out by their brethren, and
excommunicated, are not put to death, but men, who after they be cast out, live
till God comfort them and shame their enemies; but he shall appear for your
joy. Secondly, that the state of Gods Israel and the Church be all one, because
the Jewish policy was ruled by the judicial Law, and the judicial Law was no
less divine then the Ceremonial Law, is to me a wonder: For I conceive that
they do differ formally, though those same men, who were members of the state,
were members also of the Church; but, as I conceive, not in one and the same
formal reason; first, because I conceive that the State, by order of nature,
is before the Church, for when the Church was in a family state, God called
Abraham's family, and by calling made it a Church. Secondly, the Kingdom of
Israel and the house of Israel in covenant with God, as Zion and Jerusalem are
thus differenced, That to be a State was common to the Nation of the Jews with
other Nations, and is but a favor of providence; but to be a Church is a
favor of grace, and implies the Lords calling and choosing that Nation to be
his own people of his free grace, Deuteronomy. 7. 7. and the Lords gracious revealing
of his Testimonies to Jacob and Israel, whereas he did not so to every Nation
and State, Psalm. 147. 19 20. but say they, The very state of the Jews was
divine, and ruled by a divine and supernatural policy, as the judicial Law
demonstrateth to us. But I answer, Now you speak not of the state of the
Jews, common with them to all States and Nations; but you speak of such a
state and policy which I grant was Divine, but yet different from the Church;
because the Church, as the Church is ruled by the moral Law and the
Commandments of both Tables, and also by the Ceremonial Law; but the Jewish
State or Common wealth, as such was ruled by the judicial Law only, which
respects only the second Table, and matters of mercy and justice, and not
piety and matters of Religion which concern the first Table; and this is a
vast difference betwixt the state of the Jews and the Church. Thirdly, when
Israel rejected Samuel, and would have a King, conform to other Nations, they
sought that the state and form of governmnent of the Commonwealth should be
changed, and affected conformity with the Nations in their state, by
introducing a Monarchy, whereas they were ruled by Judges before; but in so
doing they changed not the frame of the Church, nor the worship of God, for
they kept the Priesthood, the whole Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial Law
entire, and their profession therein; Ergo, they did nothing which can formally
destroy the being of a visible Church, but they did much change the face of the
state and civil policy, in that they refused God to reign over them, and so
his care in raising up Judges and Saviors out of any Tribe, and brought the
government to a Monarchy, where the Crown by divine right was annexed to the
tribe of Judah. Fourthly, it was possible that the State should remain entire,
if they had a lawful King sitting upon David's throne, and were ruled according
to the Judicial Law: but if they should remain without a Priest and a Law,
and follow after Baal, and change and alter Gods worship, as the ten Tribes
did, and the Kingdom of Judah in the end did, they should so mar and hurt
the being and integrity of a visible Church, as the Lord should say, She is not
my wife, Hosea 2. 2.
neither am I her husband; and yet they might remain in that case a free
Monarchy, and have a State and policy in some better frame; though I grant, de
facto, these two Twins, State and Church, civil Policy and Religion, did die
and live, were sick and diseased, vigorous and healthy together; yet does this
More, that State and Church are different. And further, if that Nation had made
welcome, and with humble obedience believed in, and received the Messiah, and
reformed all, according as Christ taught them, they should have been a
glorious Church, and the beloved Spouse of Christ; but their receiving and
embracing the Messiah should not presently have cured their inthralled state,
seeing now the Scepter was departed from Judah, and a stranger and heathen was
their King; nor was it necessary that that Savior, whose Kingdom is not of
this world, John 18. 36. and came to bestow a spiritual redemption, and not to
reestablish a flourishing earthly Monarchy, and came to loose the works of the
Devil, Heb. 2: 14. and not to spoil Caesar of an earthly Crown, should also
make the Jews a flourishing State, and a free and vigorous Monarchy again:
Ergo, it is most clear that State and Church are two diverse things, if the one
may be restored, and not the other. Fifthly, the King, as the King was the
head of the Commonwealth, and might not meddle with the Priests office, or
perform any Ecclesiastical acts, and therefore was Uzzah smitten of the Lord
with leprosy, because he would burn incense, which belonged to the Priests
only. And the Priest in offering sacrifices for his own sins, and the
sins of the people did represent the Church, not the State. And the things of
the Lord; to wit, Church Matters, and the matters of the King, which were
civil matters of State, are clearly distinguished, 2 Chronicles. 19. 11. which
evidenceth to us, that the Church and State in Israel were two incorporations
formally distinguished. And I see not, but those who do confound them, may
also say, That the Christian State and the Christian Church be all one State,
and that the government of the one must be the government of the other; which
were a confusion of the two Kingdoms. It is true, God has not prescribed
judicials to the Christian State, as he did to the Jewish State, because
shadows are now gone, when the body Christ is come; but Gods determination of
what is morally lawful in civil Laws, is as particular to us as to them; and
the Jewish judicials did no more make the Jewish State the Jewish Church, then
it made Aaron to be Moses. and the Priest to be the King and civil Judge: yea,
and by as good reason Moses as a Judge should be a prophet, and Aaron as a
Prophet should be a Judge; and Aaron as a Priest might put a malefactor to
death, and Moses as a Judge should proph^sie, and as a Prophet should put to
death a malefactor; all which wants all reason and sense: and by that same
reason the State and Commonwealth of the Jews, as a Commonwealth, should
offer sacrifices and prophecy; and the Church of the Jews, as a Church, should
denounce war and punish malefactors, which are things I cannot conceive.

Our brethren, in their answer to the eleventh question, teach, That those who
are sui juris, as masters of families, are to separate To the eleventh
question, page 32, 33. Church Government discussed.
from these Parish-assemblies, where they must live without any lawful
Ordinance of Christ; and to remain there they hold it unlawful for these
reasons: First, we are commanded to observe all whatsoever Christ has
commanded, Matthew. 28. 10. Secondly, the Spouse seeks Christ, and rests not
till she find him in the fullest manner, Cant. 1. 7, 8. and 3. 1, 2, 3. David
lamented when he wanted the full fruition of Gods Ordinances, Psalm. 63. and
42. and 84. although he enjoyed Abiathar the high Priest, and the Ephod with
him, and Gad the Prophet, 1 Samuel 23. 6, 9. 10. 1 Samuel 22. 8. So did Ezra 8. 15,
16. yea and Christ, though he had no need of Sacraments, yet for example, would
be baptized, keep the Passover, etc. Thirdly, no ordinances of Christ may be
spared, all are profitable. Fourthly, he is a proud man, and knows not his
own heart in any measure, who thinks he may be well without any Ordinance of
Christ. Fifthly say they, it is not enough the people may be without sin, if
they want any ordinances through the fault of the superiors, for that is not
their fault who want them, but the superiors sinful neglect, as appeareeth by
the practice of the Apostles, Acts 4. 19. and 5. 29. For if they had neglected
Church-ordinances lb. page 35, 36.
till the Magistrates, who were enemies to the Gospel, had commanded them, it
had been their grievous sin. For if superiors neglect to provide bodily
food, we do not think that any man's conscience would be so scrupulous, but he
would think it lawful by all good means to provide in such a case for
himself, rather then to sit still, and to say, If I perish for hunger, it is
the sin of those who have authority over me, and they must answer for it. Now
any ordinance of Christ is as necessary for the good of the soul, as food is
necessary for temporal life.

Ans. 1. I see not how all these Arguments, taken from moral commandments, do
not oblige son as well as father, servant as master, all are Christ's free
men, son or servant, so as they are to obey what over Christ commands,
Matthew. 18. 10. and with the Spouse to seek Christ in the fullest measure, and
in all his ordinances, and son and servant are to know their own heart, so
as they have need of all Christ's ordinances; and are no more to remain in a
congregation where their souls are samished, because fathers and masters
neglect to remove to other congregations, where their souls may be fed in the
fullest measure; then the Apostles Acts 4. 29. and 5. 29 were to preach no more
in the Name of Jesus, because the Rulers commanded them to preach no more in
his Name. And therefore, with reve^ence of our godly brethren, I think this
distinction of persons free, and sui juris, and of sons and servants, not to
be allowed in this point.

2. It is one thing to remove from one congregation to another, and another
thing to separate from it, as from a false constitute Church, and to renounce
all communion therewith, as if it were the Synagogue of Satan and Antichrist,
as the Separatists do, who refuse to hear any Minister ordained by a Prelate:
now except these arguments conclude separation in this latter sense, as I
think they can never come up halfeway to such a conclusion, I see not what
they prove, nor do they answer the question, etc. concerning standing in
Parish-assemblies in Old England, and if it be lawful to continue in them.
Which question must be expounded by the foregoing, Quest. 10. If you hold that
any of our Parishionall assemblies are true visible Churches, etc. Hence the
11. Question goes thus in its genuine sense; are we not then to separate from
them, as from false Churches? Now neither the Spouse, Cant. 1. 7. c. 3. 1. 2,
3. nor David, Psalm. 63. Psalm. 42. Psalm. 84 nor Ezra. 8. 15, 16. nor Christ, in
these cases when they sought Christ in all his Ordinances in the fullest
measure, were members of false Churches: nor did they seek to Separate from
the Church of Israel, nor is it Christ's command, Mat. 28. 10. to separate from
these Churches, and to renounce all communion with them, because these who sat
in Moses Chair, did neglect many Ordinances of Christ, for when they gave the
false meaning of the Law, they stole away the Law, and so a principal
ordinance of God, and yet Christ (I believe) forbad separation, when he
commanded that they should hear them, Mat. 23.

3. Nor do I judge that because there was but one visible Church, in Israel,
and therefore it was not lawful to separate therefrom, and because under the
New Testament there be many visible Churches, and many Mount Sions, therefore
this abundance does make separation from a true Church, lawful to us, which
was unlawful to the people of the Jews. For separation lawful, is, to not
partake of other men's sins, not to converse bretherly with known flagitious
Men, not to touch any unclean thing, not to have communion with Infidels,
Idols, Belial, etc. Now this is a moral duty obliging Jews and Gentiles, and
of perpetual equity; and to adhere to, and worship God aright, in a true
Church is also a moral branch of the second command, and a seeking of Christ,
and his presence and face in his own Ordinances, and what was simply moral,
and perpetually lawful, the contrary thereof cannot be made lawful, by reason
of the multitude of Congregations.

4. The most that these arguments of our Brethren do prove, is but that it is
lawful to go, and dwell in a Congregation where Christ is worshipped in all
his Ordinances, rather then to remain in that Congregation, where he is not
worshipped in all his Ordinances; and where the Church censures are neglected,
which to us is no separation from the visible Church, but a removal from one
part of the visible Church to another, as he separateth not out of the house,
who removes from the Gallery, to remain and lie and eat in the Chamber of
the same House, because the Gallery is cold and smoaky, and the Chamber not so,
for he has not made a vow never to set his foot in the Gallery. But to our
Brethren to separate or remove from a Congregation, is to be dismembered from
the only visible Church on Earth, for to them there is not any visible Church
on Earth, except a congregation. And our Brethrens mind in all these arguments,
is to prove, that not only it is unlawful to stand in the Parish assemblies of
Old England, because of Popish ceremonies (and we teach separation from these
ceremonies to be lawful, but not from the Churches) but also that it is
necessary, to adjoyne to independent Congregations, as to the only true
visible Churches on Earth, and to none others, except we would sin against
the second Commandment, which I conceive is proved by not one of these
arguments. And to them all I answer, by a denial of the connex proposition. As
this, These who must do all which Christ commands, and seek Christ in all
his necessary Ordinances, though superiors will not do their duties, these
must separate from true visible Churches, where all Christ's Ordinances are not,
and join to independent Congregations, as to the only true visible Churches on
Earth. This proposition I deny. 5. If our Brethrens argument hold sure that we
are to separate from a Church, in which we want some Ordinances of Christ,
through the Officers negligence, because (say they Church government discussed,
answer to quest. 11. page 33.
) The Spouse of Christ will not rest, seeking Her beloved until she find him,
in the fullest manner, Cant. 1. v. 7. and 3. 1, 2. then the Spouse Cant. 1. 7.
and 3. 1, 2. is separating from one Church to another, which the Text will not
bear. 2. I would have our reverend Brethren to see and consider, if this
argument does not prove (if it be nervose and concludent) that one is to
separate from a Congregation, where are all the Ordinances of Christ, as in New
England now they are, so being, he go from a less powerful and less
spiritual Ministry, to another Congregation, where incomparably there is a
more powerful and more spiritual Ministry, for in so doing the separater
should only not rest as the Spouse does, Cant. 1. and 3. seeking his beloved
until he find Him, in the fullest manner. For he is to be found in a fuller
manner, under a more powerful Ministry, and in a less full manner under a
less powerful Ministry. But this separation I think our Brethren would not
allow, being contrary to our Brethrens Church-Oath which tieth the professor to
that congregation, whereof he is a sworn member to remain there. 6. The
design and scope of our reverent Brethrens argument, is that professors ought
to separat from Churches where presbyteriall government is, because in these
Churches, Professors, as they conceive, do not enjoy all the Ordinances of
God. Because they enjoy not the society of a Church consisting of only visible
Saints, and they enjoy not the free use of the censure of excommunication in
such a manner as in their own Churches, and because in them the Seals are
often administered by those Pastors who are Pastors of another Congregation then
their own, and for other causes also, which we think is not sound doctrine.

But we think it no small prejudice (say our Brethren) to the liberty given to
a congregation, in these words, Mat. 18. Tell the Church, if he hear not the
Church, etc. That the power of excommunication should be taken from them, and
given to a Presbyterian, or national Church, and so your Churches want some
ordinances of Christ.

Answ. Far be it from us, to take from the Churches of Christ any power which
Christ has given to them, for we teach that Christ has given to a single
congregation, Mat. 18. a power of excommunication, but how? 1. He has given to
a congregation that's alone in an Island separated from all other visible
Churches a power which they may exercise there alone, and. 2. He has given
that power to a congregation When Christ lays (...) a warrant for the power
of binding and looseing given to all Churches, his wisdom has fitted the
rule, so that it agree to al churches, to a congregation that's alone in a
remote Island, to a Church presbyteriall, or national, as Parker does apply it
to prove the power of Synods.
consociated with other sister congregations, which they may use but not
independently, to the prejudice of the power that Christ has given to other
Churches, for seeing all sister Churches are in danger to be infected with the
leaven of a contu^acious member, no less then that single congreation, whereof
the contumacious resideth as a member, Christ's wisdom, who cares for the
whole, no less then for the part, cannot have denied a power conjunct with
that congregation to save themselves from contag^ons, to all the consociated
Churches, for if they be under the same danger of contagion with the one single
congregation, they must be armed and furnished, by Christ Jesus, with the same
power against the same ill: so the power of excommunication is given to the
congregation, but not to the congregation alone, but to all the congregations
adjacent, so when I say, the God of Nature has given to the hands a power to
defend the body, I say true, and if evil do invade the body, nature does tell
it, and warn the hands to defend the body, but it follows not from this,
etc. if the power of defending the body be given by the God of Nature, to the
hands therefore that same power of defense is not given to the feet also, to
the eye to foresee the ill, to reason, to the will to command that locomotive
power, that is in all the members, to defend the body, and if nature give to
the Feet a power to defend the body, by fleeing, it is not consequence to
infer, O then has nature denied that power to the hands by fighting, so when
Christ gives to the congregation (which in consociated Churches to us is but a
part, a member, a fellowsister of many consociated congregations) he gives
also that same power of excommunicating one common enemy, to all the
consociated Churches, without any prejudice to the power given to that
congregation whereof he is a member, who is to be excommunicated, because a
power is commmon to many members, it is not taken away from any one member.
When a National Church does excommunicate a man who has killed his Father,
and is, in an eminent manner, a public stumbling ^lock to all the
congregations of a whole Nation, it is presum^d that the single congregation,
whereof this parricide is a member, does also join with the national Church
and put in exercise its own power of excommunication, with the national
Church, and therefore that congregation is not spoiled of its power, by the
national Church, which joyneth with the national Church in the use of that
power. And this I think may be thus demonstrated, The power of excomunication
is given by Christ, to a congregation not upon a positive ground, because it is
a visible instituted Church, or as it is a congregation, but this power is
given to it upon this formal ground and reason, because a congregation is a
number of sinful men, who may be scandalized and infected with the company of
a scandalous person; this is so clear that if a congregation were a company of
Angels, which cannot be infected, no such power should be given to them, even
as there was no need that Christ as a member of the Church either of Jews, or
Christians should have a moral power of avoiding the company of Publicans and
sinners, because he might possibly convert them, but they could no ways
pervert, or infect him, with their scandalous and wicked conversation,
therefore is this power given to a congregation, as they are men, who though
frailty of nature, may be If a little body of a congregation, in a remote Isle,
have power from Christ, to cut off a rotten member, l^st it infect the whole
body; shall we doubt but our wise lawgiver has given that same power to a
greater body of many visible congregations, which is under the danger of the
same con^agious infection?
leavened with the bad conversation of the scandalous, who are to be
excommunicated, as is clear, 1 Cor. 5. 6. Your glorying is not good, know ye
not that a little leaven leavneth the whole lump? therefore are we to withdraw
our selves from Drunkards, Fornicators, Extortioners, Idolaters, and are not to
eat and drink with them, v. 10. And from these who walk inordinately, and
are disobedient, 1 Thessalonians. 3. 12, 13, 14. And from Heretics after they be
admonished, lest we be infected with their company, just as nature has given
hands to a man, to desend himself from injuries and violence, and horns to
oxen to hold off violence, so has Christ given the power of excommunication to
his Church, as spiritual armor to ward off, and defend the contagion of
wicked fellowship. Now this reduplication of frail men which may be leavened,
agrees to all men of many consociated congregations, who are in danger to be
infected with the scandalous behavior of one member of a single congregation,
and agrees not to a congregation as such, therefore this power of
excommunication must be given to many confociated congregations, for the Lord
Jesus his salve, must be as large, as the wound, and his mean must be
proportioned to his end. 2. The power of Church ^jection and Church separation
of scandalous persons must be given to those to whom the power of Church
communion, and Church confirming of Christian love to a penitent excommunicate
is given, for contraries are in the same subject, as hot and cold, seeing and
blindness, but the power of Church-communio at the same Lords table, and of
mutual rebuking and exhorting, and receiving to grace after repentance,
agrees to members of many consociated Churches, as is clear, Col. 3. 16. Heb.
10. 23. 2 Cor. 2 6, 7, and not to one congregation only; Ergo, etc. the
assumption is clear, for except we deny communion of Churches, in all Gods
Ordinances, we must grant the truth of it.

2. We say that of our Saviors ( tell the Church) is not to be drawn to such
a narrow circle, as to a Parishionall Church only, the Apostle practice is
against this, for when Paul and Bannabas had no small dissension with the Jews
of a particular Church, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain
others of them, should go and tell the Apostles, Elders and whole Church
National or Oecumemek, Acts 15. 2. v. 22. and complain of those who taught
that, they behoved to be circumcised, Acts 15. 1. and that greater Church v.
22. 23. commanded by their ecclesiastic authority the contrary, and those who
may lay on burdens of commandments as this greather Church does expressly, v.
28. Acts 16. v. 4. chapter 2. v. 25. they may censure and excommunicate the
disobeyers. And Acts 6. 1. the Greek Church complained, Acts 6. of the
Hebrews, to a greater and superior Church of Apostles, and a multitude made up
of both these v. 2. and 5. and they redresed the wrongs done to the Grecian
Widows by appointing Deacons; also though there was no complaint, Acts 1. Yet
was there a defect in the Church, by the death of Judas, and a catholic
visible Church did meet, and help the defect, by chosing Mathias: it is true
the ordination of Matthias the Apostle, was extraordinary, as is clear by Gods
immediate directing of the lots, yet this was ordinary and perpetual, that the
election of Mathias was by the common suff^ages of the whole Church, Acts 1.
26. and if we suppose that the Church had been ignorant of that defect, any one
member knowing the defect, was to tell that catholic Church, whom it concerned
to choose a catholic Officer; we think Antioch had power great enough
intensively to determine the controversy, Acts 15. but it follows not that
the catholic Church v. 22. (let me term it so) had not more power extensively
to determine that same controversy, in behalf of both Antioch, and of all the
particular Churches: subordinate powers are not contrary powers.

CHAP. 5. SECT. 5. PROP. 3. QUEST. 6.
Manuscript.
ALL who would be saved must be added to the Church, as Acts 2. 47. The way of
the Church of Christ in. N. Eng.
If God offer opportunity, Genesis 17. 7. Because every Christian stands in need
of all the Ordinances of Christ, for his Spiritual edification in holy
fellowship with Christ Jesus. Answer: for clearing of this we are to discuss
this question. Whether all, and every true believer must join himself to a
particular visible congregation, which has independently power of the keys
within it self, God offering opportunity, if he would be saved?

1 Did. There is a necessity of joining our selves to a visible Church, but it
is not necessitas medii, but necessitas praecepti, it is not such a necessity,
as all are damned who are not within some visible Church, for Augustine is
approved in this, there be many Wolves within the Church, and many sheep
without; but if God offer opportunity, all are obl^ged by God his Command^ment
of confessing Christ before men, to join themselves to the true visible Church.

2. Did. There is a f^llowship with the visible Church internal, of hidden
believers, in the Romish Babel this is sufficient for salvation, necessitate
medii, but though they want opportunity to join themselves to the Reformed
visible Churches, yet do they sin in the want of a profession of the truth and
in not witnessing against the Antichrist, which is answerable to an adjoining
of themselves to a visible Church, And so those who do not profess the Faith
of the true visible Church, God offering opportunity, deny Christ before men,
and this external fellowship is necessary to all, necessitate praecepti,
though our Lord graciously pardon this as an infirmity in his own, who for
fear of cruel persecution, often dare (...) confess Christ.

3. Did. The question is not whether all ought to join themselves (...)
^isible Church, God offering occasion, but, if all ought by Christ's command, to
join themselves to the Churches independent of their visible Congregations, if
they would be saved? our Brethren (...) it, we deny it.

1. Concl. An adjoining to a visible Church either formally to be a member
thereof, or materially, confessing the Faith of the true visible Church, God
offering occasion, is necessary to all. 1. Because we are to be ready to give a
confession of the ^^pe that is in us, to every one who asks, 1 Pet. 3. 15. 2
Because he who denies Christ before men, him also will Christ deny before
(...) Father, and before the holy Angels, Mat. 10. 33. 3 Yet if some die
without the Church, having Faith in Christ, and want opportunity to confess
him before men, as repenting in the h^u^e of death, their salvation is sure,
and they are within the invisible Church: so is that to be taken, extra
Ecclesiam nulla salus, none can be saved who are every way without the Church,
both visible and invisible; as all perished who were not in Ncahs Arc.

2. Concl. When God offers opportunity, all are obliged to join themselves
to a true visible Church. 1. Because God has promised his presence to the
Churches as his Son walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks, Rev. 2.
2. 2 Because Faith comes by hearing a sent Preacher, Romans 10. 4. 3 Separation
from the true visible Church is condemned, Heb. 10. 24. Iud. v. 19. 1 John. 2.
19. 4. Good men esteem it a rich favor of God to lay hold on the skirt of a
Jew, Zech. 8. 23. and to have any communion, even as a door keeper in Gods
House, and have desired it exceedingly and complained of the want thereof,
Psalm. 84. 10. v. 1, 2. Psalm. 27. 4, Psalm. 42. 1, 2, 3, 4. Psalm. 63. v. 1, 2.

3. Concl. Our brethren, with reverence of their godliness and learning, err,
who hold all to be obliged, as they would be saved, to join to such a visible
congregation of independent jurisdiction, as they conceive to be the only true
Church visible instituted by Christ. That this is their mind is clear by the
first proposition of this Manuscript, and by their answer The 12. question
propounded by the godly and learned Brethren of old England.
to the 12 Question where they say, that all not within their visible
congregation as fixed sworn members thereof, are without the true Church, in
the Apostles meaning, 1 Cor. 5. 12. what have I to do to judge them also that
are without? do not ye judge them that are within? which is a most violent
torturing of the word. For, 1. without are dogs, Rev. 22. so our brethren
expound the one place by the other, then all not fixed members of the
congregationall Church (as they conceive it) of Corinth, are dogs, what? was
there not a Church of Saints on earth at this time, but in one independent
congregation of Corinth? and were all the rest Dogs and Sorcerers? 2. If
judgeing here especially is the censure of Excommunication used according unto
Christ's institution, that the spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord, and
so to be used only toward regenerated persons, then Paul was to intend the
salvation of none by Excommunication, but these who are members of one single
congregation, who are within this visible house of Christ, then all the rest
are without the house and so in the state of damnation. 3. These who are
without here are in a worse case, then if they were judged by the Church, that
their spirit may be saved. So they are left, v. 13. to a severe judgment, even
to the immediate judgment of God, as Cajetan. coment. ib.
Cajetan does well observe; for, says Eras. Sarcer. in loc.
Erasmus Sarcerius, Deus publica and occulta sceler a non sinet impunita, and
Bullinger oomment.
Bullinger makes (as it is clear) an answer to an objection, shall these who
are without, even the wicked Gentiles commit all wickedness without
punishment? The Apostle answers, that, (says he) God shall judge them, Non
impune in vitiorum lacunis se provolvent prophani, sed destinato tempore
commeritas dabunt Deo ultori paenas. And Paraeus v. 13.
Paraeus, number impune ibunt eorum scelera? ^mo Judicem Deum invenient. 4. These
who are within here, are these who are of Christ's family, says P. Martyr. ib.
P. Martyr, and opposite to Gentiles and infidels says Paraeus in ^s. 12.
Paraeus, for all men are divided into two ranks, some domestics, and within
the Church, and to be judged by the Church; and some strangers, without the
covenant, not in Christ, neither in profession, nor truth, as Gentiles, who are
left to the severity of Gods judgment, but our Brethrens Text shall bear that
Paul divides mankind into three rank. 1. Some within, as true members of the
Church. 2. Some without as infidels, and some without as not members of a fixed
congregation, now Believers without, and not members of a fixed congregation,
are not left to the severity of the immediate judgment of God, as these who are
without here, because they are to be rebuked, yea nor was the excommunicated
man, after he should be cast out, left to the immediate judgment of God: but
he was, 1. To remain under the medicine of excommunication, and daily to be
judged, and eschewed as a Heathen, that his spirit may be saved. 2. He was to
be rebuked as a brother 2 T^ess. 3. 15. 3. Paul saying what have I to do to
judge these that are without, God judges them, he means as much, as he will
not acknowledge them, as any ways belonging to Christ; but the believers of
approved piety, because they are not members of a fixed congregation, are not
thus cast off of Paul, he became all things to all men, that he might gain
some, and would never cast off Believers, and say what have I to do with you?
In a word; by those who are without are meant Gentiles, as Ambrosus.

with them Erasmus, and all who ever commented on this place. Lastly, our
Brethren expound these, who are within, to be the Church of Corinth, Saints by
calling, and Saints in Christ Jesus, these to whom he prays grace and peace
unto, and for whom he thanketh God for the grace given to them by Jesus Christ,
1 Cor. 1. 2. 3. Now these thus within must be regenerated, and opposed to all
not within: this way, but without, that is who are not Saints by calling, not
in Christ Jesus, then by these who are without, cannot be understood, all not
fixed members of one visible Congregation, who yet are by true faith in Christ
Jesus; and our Brethren must mean, that Paul, if he were living, would take no
care to judge, and censure us, who believe in Christ, and are members of
provincial and national Churches, and are not members of such an independent
Congregation, as they conceive to be the only instituted visible Church of the
New Testament.

But if they all not without the state of salvation who are not members of such
an independent flock. 1. All the Churches of Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus,
Th^ssalonica, Philippi, Rome, the seven Churches of Asia, who were not such
independent Churches must be in the state of damnation. 2. All are here
obliged, who look for salvation, by Jesus Christ, to join themselves to this
visible independent Church; then all who are not members of such a Church are
in the state of damnation, if (say our brethren) they know this to be the only
true Church, and join not to it. O but ignorance cannot save men from
damnation, for all are obliged to know this so necessary a mean of salvation,
where only are the meane^ of salvation, for then it should excuse Scribes and
Pharisees, that they believed not in Christ, for they knew him not, and if they
had known, they would not have crucisied the Lord of glory. 1 Cor. 2. 9, 10.
Now we judge this to be the revived error of-the Donatists, whose mind was as
Augustine says, haeres. 69. Eccl. siam Christi de ^oto te^rarum or^e (...),
^que ^s Africa Dona^i part remansyle.
Augustine says, that the Church of Christ was only in that part of Africa,
where Donatus was, and Augustine writing to Vincentius Augustine. Epist. 48 ad
Uincent in illa verba, indica, ubi pascis in meridie Viden. solam and solam
illi in Meridie, vos in occidents? says Morton apolog p. 1. c. 31. answers
Bellarmine de Ecclesia mil^^ l. 3. c. 13.
objecteth the same, as Morton answers Bellarmine, and the same say Papists
with Donatists, that out of the Church of Rome there is no salvation. And Field
of the Church 3. book. 28. chapter
Field answers well, ye are to be charged with donatisme, who deny all
Christian societies in the World, ^to be where the Popes feet are not kissed,
to pertain to the true Church of God, and so cast into Hell all the Churches
of Aethiopia, Armenia, Syri^, Graecia, Russia, and so did Optatus ( says
Morton grand imposture chapter 14. 2. challeng p. 342.
Morton, Answer, Donatists you will have the Church only to be where you art,
but in Dacia, Misi^, Thracia, Achaia, etc. where you are not, you will not have
it to be, nor will you have it to be in Graecia, Cappadocia, Egypt, etc. Where
you are not, and in innumerable Istes and Provinces. See how Gerardus refuteth
this Gerard. to. 5. de Ecclesia c. 4. p. 231. 232. nu. 35.
and certainly, if this be the only true visible Christian Church, to which all
who look for salvation by Christ Jesus, must join themselves, there is not in
the Christian World, a true visible Church but with you. 3. I^ all upon hazard
of losing salvation, must join to such a Church, having power of jurisdiction
independently within it self, then must all separate from all the reformed
Churches, where there be provincial and national Churches, now this is also
the error of the Donatists and Anabaptists, against which read what Pa^k^r ^n

learned Parker says and reverend Brightman in Apocal. 3.
Brightman, and Cartwright repl. 1. p. 175.
Cartwright, but of this hereafter. 4. The principal reason given by the
Author, is, The Lord added to the Church Acts 2. such as should be saved, this
is not in the independent visible Congregation, as is proved elsewhere. A
second reason he gives, because every Christian stands in need of the
Ordinances of Christ, for his spiritual edification, in holy fellowship, with
Christ Jesus, or else Christ ordained them in vain, therefore all who would be
saved, must join to a visible independent congregation; hence no Church has
title and due right to the Word and Sacraments, but members of such a
congregation: this is the reason why men of approved piety are denied the
Seals of the covenant, and their children excluded from Baptism and
themselves debarred from the Lords Supper, because they are not members of your
congregation, and members they cannot be, because they find no warrant from
Gods Word, to swear your Church Covenant, and to your Church Government, which
is so far against the Word of God: the Seals of the covenant belong to all
professing Believers, as Gods Word says, Acts 10. 47. Acts 8. 37. Acts 16. 31,
32, 33. 1 Cor. 11. 28. Whether Non distinguendum, ubi lex, ubi legislator non
distinguit.
he be a member of a particular independent Church, or not, God the Lawgiver
makes not this exception, neither should man do it.

Propos. 3. All are entered by covenant into a Church State, Manuscript chapter 1.
sect. 3.
or into a membership of a visible Church.

Answ. Here are we to encounter with a matter much pressed by our reverend
Brethren, called a Church covenant. A Treatise came unto my hand in a
Manuscript of this Subject; In their Apology, and in their answer to the
questions propounded by the Brethren of Old England this is much pressed. I
will first explain the Church Covenant according to our reverend Brethrens
mind. 2: Prove there is no such thing in Gods Word. 3. Answer their Arguments
taken out of the Old Testament. 4. Answer their Arguments from the New
Testament, both in this Treatise here in this Chapter, and hereafter; and also
their arguments in all their Treatises. Hence for the first two, I begin with
this first question.

Whether or not all are to he In-churched or entered Members of a visible
Church by an explicit, and vocal or prof^ssed Covenant?

Our brethrens mind is first to be cleared. 2. The state of the question to be
explained. 3. The truth to be confirmed. In the answers to the questions Quest.
8.
sent to New England they require of all persons come to age, before they be
received members of the Church:

1. A publiqu^ vocal declaration of the manner and soundness of their
conversion, and that either in continued speech (says Apology of the Churches
of New England, c. 3.
the Apology) or in answer to questions propounded by the Elders.

2. They require a public prof^ssion of their faith, concerning the articles
of their religion, the foresaid way also.

3. An express vocal covenanting by oath, to walk in that faith; and to
submit (says the Author) The way of the Church of Christ in New England, chapter
1. sect. 1. prop. 3.
themselves to God, and one to another, in his fear; and to walk in a
professed subjection to all his holy Ordinances, cleaving one to another, as
fellow members of the same body in brotherly love and holy watchfulness unto
mutual edification in Christ Jesus.

4. And a covenanting, not to depart from the said Church, without the consent
thereof.

This Church Covenant (says the Apology) Apology for the Church of N. E. chapter
3.
is the essential or formal cause of a visible Church, as a flock of Saints
is the material cause, and so necessarily of the being of a Church, that
without it none can claim Church Communion; and therefore it is that whereby a
Church is constituted in its integrity, that whereby a fallen Church is again
restored; and that, which being taken away, the Church is dissolved, and
cease to be a Church; and it is that whereby Ministers have power over the
people, and people interest in their Ministers, and one member has interest
and powerover another fellow-member.

The manner of entering in Church State is this:

1. A number of Christians, with a gifted or experienced Elder meet often
together (says this Way of the Church, chap. 1. sect. 2.
Author) about the things of God, and perform some duties of prayer, and
spiritual conference together, till a sufficient company of them be well
satisfied, in the spiritual good estate one of another, and so have approved
themselves to one another consciences, in the sight of God, as living stones,
fit to be said on the Lords spiritual Temple.

2. They having acquainted the Christian Magistrate, and nearest adjoining
Churches, of their purpose of entering into Church Fellowship convene in a day
kept with fasting and praying, and preaching, one b^ing chosen with common
consent of the whole, in name of the rest, stands up, and propounds the
covenant, in the foresaid four Articles above named.

3. All the rest declare their joint consent in this covenant, either by
silence, or word of mouth, or writing,

4. The brethren of other Churches, some specials, in name of the rest, reach
out to them the right hand of fellowship, exhorting them to stand steadfast in
the Lord. Which done, prayers made to God for pardon and acceptance of the
people, a Psalm is sung.

But when a Church is to be gathered together of Infidels, they must be first
converted believers, and so fit materials for Church fellowship, before any of
those things can be done by them.

5. Baptism makes none members of the visible Church.

6. A Church fallen, cannot be accepted of God to Church fellowship, till they
renew their Church covenant. Thus shortly for their mind about the gathering of
a visible Church. Let these distinctions be considered for the right stating of
the question.

1. Distinct. There is a covenant of free grace, betwixt God and sinners,
founded upon the surety Christ Jesus; laid hold on by us, when we believe in
Christ, but a Church Covenant differenced from this is in question, and sub
judice lis est.

2. Distinct. There is a covenant of baptism, made by all, and a covenant
vertuall and implicit renewed, when we are to receive the Lords Supper, but an
explicit positive professed Church covenant, by oa^h in-churching a person, or
a society, to a State-church is now questioned.

3. Distinct. An explicit vocal Covenant whereby we bind our selves to the
first three Articles in a tacit way, by entering in a new relation to such a
Pastor, and to such a Flock, we deny not, as if the thing were unlawful* for
we may swear to perform Gods commandments, observing all things requisite in
a lawful oath. 2. But that such a covenant is required by divine institution,
as the essential form of a Church and Church Membership, as though without
this none were entered members of the visible Churches of the Apostles, nor can
now be entered in Church State, nor can have right unto the seals of the
covenant, we utterly deny.

4. Distinct. We grant a covenant in Baptism which is the seal of our entry
unto the visible Church. 2. That it is requisite that such Heretics, Papists,
Infidels, as be received as members of our visible Church, (from which Papists
have fallen, having received baptism from us) do openly profess subjection
to God, and his Church, in all the Ordinances of God. And that Infidels give a
confession of their faith, before they be baptized. 3. Nor deny we that at the
election of a Pastor, the Pastor and people tie themselves, by reciprocation of
oaths, to each other, the one to fulfill faithfully the ministry that he has
received of the Lord; the other to submit to his ministry in the Lord, but
these reciprocal oaths, make neither of them members of a visible Church, for
they were that before these oaths were taken.

5. Distinct. Any professor removing from one congregation to another, and so
coming under a new relation to such a Church, or such a Ministry, is in a
tacit and vertuall covenant to discharge himself in all the duties of a
member of that Congregation, but this is nothing for a Church Covenant; for
when six are converted in the congregation whereof I am a member, or an
excommunicated person heartily and unfainely repents, there arises a new
relation betwixt those converts and the Church of God; and a tie and obligation
of duties to those persons greater then was before, as being now members of one
mystical and invisible body. Yet cur brethren cannot say, there is requisite,
that the Church renew their Church Covenant toward such, seeing the use of the
Covenant renewed is to restore a fallen Church, or to make a non-Church to be a
Church; and if those six be converted by my knowledge, there resulteth thence
an obligation of a vertuall and tacit covenant betwixt them and me; but there
is no need of an explicit and vocal covenant, to tie us to duties that we are
now obliged to in a stricter manner then we were before; for when one is taken
to be a steward in a great family, there may be a sort of Covenant betwixt that
servant and the Lord of the house, and there resulteth from his office and
charge a tie and obligation, not only to the head of the family, but also to
the children and fellow servants of the house; but there is no need of an
express, vocal, and professed covenant betwixt the new steward and the
children and servants; yea and strangers also, to whom he owes some acts of
steward-duties, though there do result a vertuall covenant. Far less is
there a necessity of an express and vocal covenant before that steward can
have claim to the keys, or be received in office. So when one enters into
covenant with God, and by faith lays hold on the covenant, there resulteth
from that act of taking the Lord to be his God, a covenant-obligation to do
duty to all men, as the covenant of God does oblige him; yea, and to do works
of mercy to his beast ( for a good man will have mercy on the life of his
beast) and he is obliged to a duty by that covenant with God to his children,
which are not yet borne, to servants who are not yet his servants, but shall
hereafter be his servants, to these who are not yet converted to Christ, now it
is true a vertuall and tacit covenant, resulteth toward all these, even toward
the beast, the children not yet borne, etc. when the person first by faith
enters in covenant with God; but none, master of common sense and judgment
will say there is required a vocal and explicit, and professed covenant,
betwixt such an one entered in covenant with God, and his beast, and his
children not yet borne, or that the foresaid tacit and vertuall covenant,
which does but result from the man his covenanting with God is either the
cause, or essence, or formal reason, whereby he is made a formal contracter
and covenanter with God. So, though when I enter a member of such a
congregation, there arises thence an obligation of duty, or a tacit covenant,
tying me in duties to all members present, or which shall be members of that
congregation, though they should come from India; yet in reason it cannot be
said, that there is required an express vocal covenant betwixt me and all,
who shall be fellow members of this congregation; and far less that such a
covenant does make me a member of that congregation, yea because I am already a
member of that congregation; thence arises a tacit covenant toward such and
such duties and persons.

6. I understand not how our brethren do keep Christian and religious
communion, with many professors of approved piety, and that in private
conference, praying together, and publicly praising together, and yet deny to
have any Church Communion with such approved professors, in partaking with them
the seals of the covenant, and censures of the Church, I doubt how they can
comfort the feeble minded, and not also warn and rebuke them, which are called
acts of Church-c^nsure.

Then the question is not, if there be a tacit and vertuall covenant when
persons become members of such a visible congregation. 2. Nor do we question
whether such a Church Covenant may be lawfully sworn. We think it may, though
to swear the last article not to remove from such a congregation without their
consent, I think not lawful, nor is my habitation in such a place a matter of
Church Discipline. 3. But the The state of the question concerning the Church
covenant.
question is, if such a Church Covenant, by Divine or Apostolic warrant, not
only be lawful, but the necessary and Apostolic mean, yea and the
essential form of a visible Church; so as without it persons are not members
of one visible Church, and want all right and title to a Church Membership, to
the seals of grace, and censures of the Church. Our brethren affirm, we deny.

Concl. The former considerations being clear, we hold that such a
Church Covenant is a conceit destitute of all authority of Gods Word, Old or
New Testament, and therefore to be rejected as a way of men's devising,

1. Argum. All will worship laying a band on the Conscience, where God has
laid none, is damnable; but to tie the oath of God to one particular duty
rather then another, so as you cannot, without such an oath, enter into such a
state, nor have title and right to the seals of grace and Gods Ordinances, is
will worship, and that by virtue of a divine Law, and is a binding of the
Conscience where God has not bound it.

The major is undeniable. Papists as Alphonsus a Castr. tit. vota.
Alphonsus a Castro, and Bellarm. de eccles. milit. lib. 4. cap. 9. ^andem
heresin. Lampetianorum Lutherus tenet.
Bellarmin^ lay upon us, that which was the error of Lampetians, that we
condemn all sort of vowe^, ^^ snares to the Consciences of men. But
Bellarmine Bellarm, de Monarch. l. 2. c. 15.
says, that Luther and Ca^^in acknowledge, We think vows of things commanded
of God lawful; the truth is, we teach it to be will worship to a person to vow
single life, where God has not given the gift of continency, because men bind
with an oath that which God has not bound us unto by a command. So Origin.
Nazianzen. Ambrose. Augustinus exponit i^lud, Matthew. 19. 11.
Origin, Gregory, Nazianzen, Ambrose, Augustine say, Those which want the gift
of continency cannot live without wives, and so should not burn. See how
Bellarm. de Monach, lib. 2. cap. 31.
Bellarmine and Maldonat. in Math. 19.
Maldonat contending for will worship, prescribe the contrary. I prove the
assumption; for a Minister to swear the oath of fidelity to his flock, is
lawful; but to tie an oath so to his Ministry, as to say the Apostles teach,
he cannot be a minister who swears not that oath, is to lay a bond on the
Conscience, where God has laid none. That a father swear to perform the
duties of a father, a master the duties of a master toward his servant, is
lawful; but to lay a bond on him, that he is in Conscience, and before God no
father, no master, except he swear to perform those duties, is to lay a bond
on the Conscience where God has laid none. So to swear subjection to such a
Ministry and visible Church, is lawful; but to tie by an Apostolic Law and
practice the oath of God so to such duties, as to make this Church-oath the
essential form of such membership, so as you cannot enter into Church State,
nor have right to the Seals of the Covenant without such an oath, is to bind
where God has not bound; for there is no Law of God, putting upon any
Church-oath such a state, as that it is the essential form of
Church Membership, without the which a man is no Churchmember, and the Church
visible, not swearing this oath is no Church.

3 That way are members to be in-Churched, and to enter into a
Church Fellowship, which way members were entered in the Apostolic Church. But
members were not entered into the Apostolic Church by such a Covenant, but
only they believed, professed belief, and were baptized; when the incestuous
person is re-entred (it is said) only, 2 Cor. 2. he was grieved, and testified
it, and they did forgive him, and confirm their love to him, 7, 8. there is
here no Church Covenant; and Samaria 8. 12. received the Word gladly, believed,
and was baptized; when Saul is converted Acts 9. Simon Magus baptized, Acts 8.
Cornelius and his house baptized, Acts 20. the Church of Ephe^us planted, Acts
19. of Corinth, Acts 18. 8. of Berea, Acts 17. 10. Philippi Acts 16.
Th^ssalonica, Acts 17. of Rom, Acts 28. We hear no expressed vocal Covenant.
So Acts 2. three thousand were added to the visible Church; now they were not
gathered nor in-Churched as you gather: First, they did not meet often together
for prayer and spiritual conference, while they were satisfied in Conscience
of the good estate one of another, and approved to one another Consciences in
the sight of God, as living stones fit to be laid in the Lords spiritual
Temple, as you require; The way of the Churches, Chap. Sect. 2.
because frequent meeting and satisfaction in Conscience of the regeneration
one of another could not be performed by three thousand, all converted and
added to the Church in one day; for before they were non-Converts, and at one
Sermon were pricked in heart that they had slain the Lord of glory, Acts 2.
37. 42. and the same day there were added to them three thousand souls. Our
brethren say, It was about the P^ntecost, when the day was now the longest, and
so they might make short confessions of the soundness of their conversation
before the Apostles, who had such discerning spirits.

Answ. Truly it is a most weak and reasonlesse conjecture for all the three
thousand behoved to be miraculonsly quick of discerning; for they could not
swear mutually one to another those Church-duties, except they had been
satisfied in Conscience of the regeneration of one another. Surely such a
miracle of three thousand extraordinarily gifted with the spirit of discerning
would not have been concealed, though it be sure, Ananias and Saphira, who
deceived the Apostles, were in this number.

Secondly, how could they all celebrate a day of fasting and prayer, and from
the third hour, which is our ninth hour, dupatch the confessions and
evidences of the sound work of conversion of thirty hundred, all baptized and
added to the Church? Capiat qui volet; because this place is used to prove a
Church Covenant, I will here once for all deliver it out of our brethrens
hands: The Author of the Church Covenant Discourse of Church Covenant, fol. 22,
23.
says, There was hazard of excommunication, John 9. 22. and persecution. Acts
5. 3. and therefore the very profession of Christ in such peri^^us times was a
sufficient note of discerning, to such discerning spirits as the Apostles.

Answ. If you mean miraculous power of discerning in the Apostles, that was
not put forth in this company, where were such hypocrites as Ananias and
Saphira. Secondly, this miraculous discerning behoved to be in all the three
thousand, for the satisfaction of their Consciences, of the good estate
spiritual of all of them. And if it be miraculous (as it must be, if done in
the space of six hours, as it was done the same day that they heard Peter,
verse. 41.) then our brethren cannot allege it for ordinary inchurching of
members as they do. Secondly, if it be an ordinary spirit of discerning, then
at one act of profession are members to be received, and so often meeting for
the satisfaction of all their Consciences is not requisite. Thirdly, if
profession for fear of persecution be an infallible sign, then those who are
chased out of England by Prelates, and come to New England, to seek the
Gospel in purity, should be received to the Church, whereas you hold them out
of your societies many years. Fourthly, suffering for a while for the truth is
not much, Judas, Alexander, Demas, did that for a while.

The Apolog. chap. 6.
Apology and discourse of the Church Covenant says, Discourse of the
Church Covenant, fol. 24.
These converts professed their glad receiving of the Word, verse. 37 38. in
saving themselves from that untoward generation, else they had not been
admitted to baptism. But all this made them not members of the Church for they
might havereturned, notwithstanding of this, to Pontus, Asia, Cappadocia, etc.
but they continued steadfastly (...), in the doctrine of the Apostles. Secondly,
they continued in fellowship, this is Church Fellowship; for we cannot say,
That it was exercise of Doctrine and Sacraments, and confound this fellowship
with doctrine, no more then we can confound doctrine and sacraments, which are
distinguished in the Text, and therefore it is a fellowship of holy
Church State, and so notes;

1. A combination in Church State.

2. In gifts inward to edification, and outward in relief of the poor by
worldly goods.

Answ. 1. They could not continue steadfast in the Apostles doctrine and
fellowship before they were added to the Church, for steadfastness in Doctrine,
and saving themselves from the froward generation, could not be but habitual
holiness, not perfected in six hours. Now that same day, verse. 41. in the
which they gladly heard the Word, they were both baptized and added to the
Church; and therefore their steadfast continuing in Church State, can no ways
make them members in Church State. Secondly, though they should have returned
to Pontus and Asia, etc. they returned added to the Church; Church State is no
prison-state, to tie men to such a congregation locally, as you make it.
Thirdly, there is no word of a Church Covenant, except when they were baptized
they made it, and that is no Church Covenant, and that should not be omitted,
seeing it conduces so much, first, to the being of the visible Church, in the
which we must serve God acceptably; Secondly, and is of such consequence to the
end, that the holy things of God be not profaned, as you say. Thirdly, that
the Seals of the Covenant be not made signs of falsehood. Fourthly, we would
not be stricter then God, who received upon six hours profession three
thousand to Church state. Fifthly, the (...) fellowship is no fellowship of
Church Order, which made them members of the visible Church, because the first
day that they heard Peter they were added to the Church, and being added they
continued in this fellowship, and in use of the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer;
as a reasonable soul is that which makes a man discourse, and discoursing is
not the cause of a reasonable soul Beza annot. marg. Act. 2. 43.
Beza calls it fellowship in Christian charity to the poor. And Syrus
interp. ibid.
the Syrian interpreter, (...). Arab. interp. ibid.
The Arablan interpreter says the same. Latin. interp. ibid.
The ancient Latin interpreter, (...).

Fourthly, if Baptism be the Seal of our entry into the Church, as 1 Cor.
12. 13. as Circumcision was the Seal of the members of the Jews visible
Church, then such a Covenant is not a formal reason of our Church Membership,
but the former is true, as I shall prove hereafter; Ergo, so is the latter. The
Proposition stands, because all the baptized are members of the visible
Church before they can swear this Covenant, even when they are Infants.

5. Argu. This Church Covenant is either all one with the Covenant of grace, or
it is a Covenant diverse from the Covenant of grace; but neither ways can it be
the essential form of a visible Church; Ergo,

First, the Covenant of grace cannot be the form of a visible Church, because
then all baptized, and all beleevess should be in Covenant with God, as Church
members of a visible Church, which our brethren deny. If it be a Covenant
diverse from it, it must be of another nature, and lay another obligatory tie,
then either the Covenant of works, or the Covenant of grace, and so must tie
us to other duties then either the Law or Gospel require of us; and so is
beside that Gospel which Paul taught and makes the teacher, though an Angel
Gal. 1. 8. 2 Ep. Joh. 10.
from Heaven, accursed, and not to be received.

The Apology of the Church of new England.
Apology answering this, says, First, We call it a Church Covenant, to
distinguish it from civil Covenants, and also from the Covenant of grace; for
the Eunuch and godly strangers, Isaiah 56. 3. were in the covenant of grace by
faith, and yet complained that they were separated from the Church, and not in
Covenant with Gods visible Church.

Answ. 1. No doubt an excommunicated person, whose spirit is saved in the day
of Christ, may be in the Covenant of grace, and yet cut off from the visible
Church for enormous scandals; but this is no ground to make your
Church Covenant different from the Covenant of grace. A believer in the
Covenant of grace may not do a duty to father, brother, or master; but it is a
weak consequence, that therefore there is a Covenant-oath betwixt brother and
brother, son and father, servant and master, which is commanded by a divine
Law of perpetual equity under both old and new Testament, as you make this
Covenant of the Church to be, which persons must swear, ere they can come
under these relations of brother, son, and servant. The Covenant of grace, and
the whole Evangell, teach us to confess Christ before men, and to walk before
God, and be perfect, and so that we should join our selves to the true visible
Churh. But none can in right reason conclude, that it is a divine Law that
necessitateth me to swear another Covenant then the Covenant of grace, in
relation to those particular duties, or to swear over again the Covenant of
grace, in relation to the duties that I owe to the visible Church, else I am
not a member thereof. And that same Covenant in relation to my father, brother,
and master, else I cannot be a son, brother, or servant; this were to
multiply Covenants according to the multitude of duties that I am obliged unto,
and that by a divine commandment. The word of God Act. 20. 28. (...). 13. 17. 1 Timothy 5. 17. 1 Pet. 5. ^, 4.
lays a tie on Pastors to feed the flock, and the flock to submit, in the
Lord to the Pastors. But God has not, by a new commandment, laid a new tie and
obligation, that Timothy shall not be made a Pastor of a Church at Ephesus, and
a member thereof, nor the Church at Ephesus constituted in a Church State,
having right to all the holy things of God, while, first, they be all persuaded
of one another regeneration; secondly, while all swear those duties in a
Church-oath; thirdly, and all swear that they shall not separate from Church
followship, but by mutual consent.

Hear a reply again to this of the Apol. ^^. 8
Apology; such promises as leave a man in an absolute estate as he was before,
and engage only his act, not his person, these lay no forcing band on any man,
but as every man is tied to keep his lawful promise, are tied: But yet such
promises or covenants as are made according to the Ordinances of God, and do
put upon men a relative estate, they put on them a forcing band to perform
such duties, such as are the promises of marriage betwixt man and wife, master
and servant, magistrate and subject, minister and people, brother and brother
in Church State; these put on men a divine tie, and bind by a divine Ordinance
to perform such duties. But these Scriptures make not these relations, these
places make not every man who can teach, a Pastor to us, except we call him to
be our Pastor; indeed if we call him, we engage our selves in subjection to
him: you might as well say, It is not the c^venanting of a wife to her husband,
or the subject to the magistrate, that gives the husband power over his wife,
and the magistrate power over his subject, but the word of God that gives
power to both, and yet you know well the husband cannot call such an one his
wife, but by covenant made in marriage.

Answ. This is all which with most color of reason can be said. But these
places of Scripture are not brought to prove the Pastors calling to the people,
or their relative case of subjection to him, but only they prove, that the
covenant of grace and whole Gospel lays a tie of many duties upon us, which
obliges us, without coming under the tie of an express, vocal, and public
oath, necessitating us by a divine Law, because in this that I profess the
faith of Christ, and am baptized, I am a member of the visible Church, and have
right to all the holy things and seals of grace, without such an oath, because
the covenant of grace tieth me to a^joyne my self to some particular
congregation, and a called Pastor who has gi^^^, and a calling from the
Church, is a member of the visible Church, before he be called to be your
Pastor, though he be a member of no particular congregation; for you lay down
as an undeniable principle, and the basis of your whole doctrine of independent
government; that there are no visible Churches in the world but a congregation
meeting in one place to worship God, which I have demonstrated to be most
false: for if my hand be visible, my whole body is visible, though with one act
of the eye it cannot be seen; if a part of a meadow be visible, all the meadow,
thought ten miles in breadth and length, is visible: so, though a congregation
only may be actually seen, when it is convened within the sour Angles of a
material house, yet all the congregations on earth make one visible Church,
and have some visible and audible acts of external government cummon to all;
as that all pray, praise, fast, mourn, rejoice, one with another; and are to
rebuke, exhort, comfort one another, and to censure one another, so far as is
possible, and of right and by Law meet in one council, and so by Christ's
institution are that way visible; that a single cong egation is visible which
meets in one house, though many be absent de facto, through sickness
callings, imprisonment, and some through sinful neglect; and therefore you do
not prove, that we are made members of the visible Church, having right to all
the holy things of God, by a Church-oath or covenant as you speak; neither do
we deny but when one does enter a member to such a congregation under the
ministry of A. B. but he comes under a ^ew relative state, by an implicit
and vertuall covenant, to submit to his ministry, yea and A. B. comes under
that same relative state of Pastoral feeding of such an one. But you do not
say, that A. B. enters by a vocal Church Covenant, in a membership of Church
order, and that by a commanded covenant of perpetual equity, laying a new
forcing band upon both the person and the acts of A. B. just as the husband and
the wife come under a marriage covenant. So C. D. sometime excommunicated, now
repents, and is received as a gained brother, in the bosom of the Church;
all the members of the Church come by that under a new relation to C. D. as to
a repenting brother, and they are to love, reverence, exhort, rebuke, comfort
him, by virtue of the covenant of grace, but (I conceive) not by a new Church
covenant entering them as in a Church membership, and Church order toward him.
So a new particular Church is erected, and now counted in amongst the number of
the visible Churches; all the sister Churches are to discharge themselves in
the duties of embracing, loving, exhorting, edifying, rebuking, comforting this
sister Church new elected. But I think our brethren will not say, That all the
sister Churches are to make a new express vocal Church covenant with this
sister Church, and such a Church covenant as makes them all visible Churches,
which have right to all the holy things of God, in and with this new sister
Church; it is the covenant of grace once laid hold on by all these sister
Churches, which tieth them to all Christian duties, both one toward another,
and also toward all Churches to come in. I think there is no necessity of an
express covenant of marriage betwixt this new Church, and all the former
sister Churches, as there is a solemn marriage oath betwixt the Husband and
the Wife, and a solemn covenant betwixt the supreme Magistrate and the King
and his Subjects, when the King is crowned; all we say is this, if for new
relations God laid a bond and compelling tie of conscience, and that of
perpetual equity, whereby we are entered in every new relative state, beside
the bond that Law and Gospel lay on us, to do duties to all men both in
Church and Commonwealth, then when a person is converted unto Christ, and
another made a Lawyer, and another a Pastor, another a Physician, another a
Magistrate, another a learned Philosopher and President of an Academy, another a
skilled Schoolmaster, and so come under new relations many and diverse in the
Church and State, I should not be obliged to love, honor, and reverence them
all by virtue of the fifth Commandment; but I behoved by virtue of a
particular Covenant (I know not how to name it) to come under some new relative
marriage toward all these, else I could not perform duties of love and
reverence to them; and though there be a convenant tacit betwixt a new member
of a congregation, and A. B. the Pastor, and they come under a new relation,
covenant ways (which I grant) is not the point in question, but this new
covenant is that which by necessity of a divine Commandment of perpetual
equity, makes the now adjoyner a member of the visible Church, and gives him
right and claim to the seals of the covenant, so as without this covenant he
is without, and not to be judged by the Church, but left to the judgment of
God, as 1 Cor. 5. 12, 13. one who is without. Thirdly, the Apology for the
Churches of New England, c. 5.
Apology says, and Discouse of a Church covenant, fo. 2.
Author of the Church covenant. The covenant of grace is done in private in a
man's closet, betwixt the Lord and himself, the other in some public
assembly. 2. The covenant of grace is of one christian in particular, the other
of a company jointly, some call the one personal, the other general. Answ.
Though the covenant of grace may be laid hold on in a closet or private
chamber, yet the principal party contracter is God on the one part; and on the
other not a single man, but Christ, Gal. 3. 16. Psalm. 2. 8, 9. Esau 53. 10.
and all his seed, Heb. 8. 8.
yea the Catholic church, Ier. 31. 31. chapter 32. v, 38, 39, 40, 41. I^rem. 50.
5.
all the House of Israel; But our brethrens mind is, that conversion of souls
to Christ is not a Church act, nor a Pastoral act, but a work of charity,
performed by private christians; yet by the Pastoral pains of Peter, three
thousand, Act. 2. were converted; and this is a depressing of public
ministry, and an exalting of popular prophesying, which is the only public
and ordinary mean blessed of God, for conversion. 2. By this all the covenants
sworn in Israel and Judah were not a swearing of the covenant of grace but of
a Church covenant, which we must refute hereafter. 3. We desire an instance or
practice of receiving any into the public assembly, by this Church covenant;
public receiving by baptism we grant in Cornelius, Act. 10. the Eunuch, Act.
8. Lydia, and her house, Act. 16. the Iayler, Act. 16. but we never read of
Saul's Church^covenant, and Church confession, whereby he was publicly received
into Church membership, nor of such private trial of Church members and
therefore we think it to be a devise of men.

6. Arg. If this Church Covenant be the essence and form of a visible Church,
which differenceth betwixt the visible and invisible Church, then there have
been no visible Churches since the Apostles days, nor are there any in the
Christian World, this day, save only in New England and some few other places,
for remove the form and essence of a thing, and you remove the thing it self:
now if this be true, and if Ministers have Ministerial or pastoral power over
people, and the people no relation unto them as to Pastors, except they
mutually enter into this Church Covenant, then are they no Pastors to the
people at all, and so all Baptized in the reformed Churches, where this
covenant was not, are as Pagans and Infidels, and all their Baptism no
Baptism, and all their Church Acts no Church Acts, and they all are to be
Rebaptized.

The Author of the Church Covenant Discourse of the Church Covenant fol. 26,
27, 28.
says, there is a real, implicit, and substantial coming together, and a
substantial professing of faith and agreement, which may preserve the essence
of the Church in England, and other places, though ^hers be not so express and
formal a covenanting, as need were; The eternity of the covenant of God is
such, that it is not the interposition of many corruptions, that may arise in
after time, that can disanull the same, except they wilfully break the
covenant, and reject the offer of the Gospel, which we persuade our selves
England is not come unto, and so the covenant remains which preserves the
essence of the Churches to this day; and he gives this answer from learned
Parker Parker de pol. Eccles. l. 3. c. 16. p. 166. 167.
and he alleges Fox Fox acts and monum. 137.
who out of Gilda, says England received the Gospel in Tiberi^^ his time, and
Joseph of Arimathea was sent from France to England by Philip the Apostle an.
^2.

Answ. I deny not but Tertullian, and Nicephorus both, say, the Gospel then
came to the wildest in Britain, and no doubt be ^^ved to come to Scotland,
when Simon Zelotes cam^ to Britain; but so did the Gospel come to Rome,
Philippi, Corinth, will i^ follow that the covenant is there yet? And 1. If the
not wilful rejecting of the Gospel save the essenc^ of a visible Church in
England (which charity we command in our Brethren) Rome may have share of the
charity also, and there may be a true visible Church there, as yet: and we then
wronged them in separation from them, Because Gods people in Babel, did never
wilfully reject the covenant. 2. Our brethren profess Apology c. 8.
they cannot receive into their Church, the godly persecuted and banished out
of Old England, by Prelates for the truth, unless (says he) they be pleased
to take hold of our Church Covenant. Now not to admit into your Churches, such
as cannot swear your Church covenant, in all one as to acknowledge such not a
true Church, and to separate from them, and so the want of an explicit and
formal Church-covenanting, to you makes professors no Church-visible, and
unworthy of the seals of grace; but reverend Parker P^^ker de polit. 3. c. 6.
says, that there is such a profession of the covenant in England, sic ut
secessionem facere salva conscientia nullus possit, that no man with a safe
conscience can separat therefrom. 3. The ignorants and simple ones amongst the
Papists have not rejected the Gospel obstinately, in respect it was never
revealed to them, yet the simple ignorance of points principally fundamental
makes them a non-Church, and therefore the want of your Church Covenant must
un-Church all the reformed Churches on Earth: It is not much that this Author
says, the primitive Church never did receive children to the communion, nor
any till they made a confession of their Faith. What then? a confession of
their Faith and an evidence of their knowledge, is not your Chuoch-covenant for
by your Church Covenant the parties to be received in the Church must give
testimony of their conversion to the satisfaction of the consciences of all
your Church; The old confirmation of children was not such a thing. 2. The
trial of the knowledge of such, as were of old not yet admitted to the Lords
Supper, is not an inchurching of them, because, if any not that way tried in
the ancient Church, did fall into scan^alcus sins, they were, being come to
years liable to the censures of the Church, which said, certainly the ancients
acknowledged them to be members of that visible Church, but you say expressly,
they are without, and you have not to do to judge them, 1 Cor. 5. 12. And let

rather the repetition of Baptism; so Whitgift p. 59. 4.

7. Argum. A multitude of unwarrantable ways partly goes before, partly
conveyeth this Church Covenant, As. 1. It is a dream that all are converted by
the means of private Christians, without the Ministry of sent Pastors, by
hearing of whom Faith comes, all are made materials and convertes in private
without Pastors; judge if this be Christ's order and way. 2. How it is possible
a Church shall be gathered amongst Infidells? this way Infidells cannot convert
Infidells, and Pastors as Pastors cannot now be sent, by our Brethrens
Doctrine, for Pastors are not Pastors but in relation to a particular
congregation, therefore Pastors as Pastors cannot be sent to Indians. 3. They
must be assured in conscience, at least satisfied in every one another
salvation, and sound conversion: were the Apostles satisfied anent the
conversion of Anainas, Saphira, Simon Magus, Alexander, Hymeneus, Philetus,
Demas and others? 4. By what warrant of the word are private Christians, not in
office, made the ordinary and only converters of Souls to Christ? conversion
comes then ordinarily and solely by unsent Preachers, and private persons
Ministry. 5. What warrant have the sister Churches, of the word, to give the
right hand of fellowship to a new erected Church? for, to give the hand of
fellowship is an authoritative and pastoriall act, as Gal. 2 9. When James,
Cephas, and John perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave unto me
and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that is, says Pareus, Pareus, in
collei^^m apostolorum nos receperunt, dextrit nobiscum ju^ctis, quod intimae
conjunctionis nostrae signum fuit and obsignatio.
they received us to the college of the Apostles, so Bullinger Bullinger ib.
and Beza, a^not.
Beza, now this is to receive them in amongst the number of Churches, as
Pareus, and members of the catholic Church, but Churches being all
independent, and of a like authority, the Sister Churches having no power over
this new erected Church, what authority has Sister Churches, to acknowledge
them as Sister Churches? For 1. They cannot be upon two or three hours ^^ght
of them, hearing none of them speak, satisfied in their consciences of their
Regeneration. 2. By no authority can they receive them as members of the
catholic Church, for this receiving it a Church-act and they have no
Church Power over them. 3. What a meeting is this of diverse Churches for the
receiving of a new Sister Church? It is a Church (I believe) meeting together,
and yet it is not a congregation, and it is an ordinary visible Church, for at
the admitting of all converts to the Church Order, this meeting must be: surely
here our brethren acknowledge that there is a Church, in the New Testament made
up of many congregations, which has power to receive in whole Churches, and
members of Churches unto a Church Fellowship; this is a visible provincial, or
national Church, which they other ways deny.

6. We see no warrant, why one not yet a Pastor or Elder should take on him to
speak to a congregation, though they all consent that he speak, exhort and
pray, we desire a warrant from Gods Word, that such a thing should be; here is
preaching, and Church-preaching, Church-praying and praising, and yet there is
no Pastor nor man called to office, we see not how this will abide the measure
of the Golden-neede, especially in a constituted Church*

7. We desire to see such a Church-action, Acts 2. Where three thousand were
added in one day to the Church.

8. If it be enough that all be silent, and testify their consent to the Church
covenant by silence, how is the Church-Magistrate and these of other Churches
satisfied in conscience of the conversion of all? for all consent to this, the
Magistrate may be a King, and he cannot acknowledge these as a Church, whose
faces he never saw before.

9. They swear to be good stewards of the manifold graces of God, and so to
public prophesying, for converting souls, here be men sworn in a Church Way
to feed the flock, and yet they are not Pastor^.

10. Here are Church-acts and the power of the Keys exercised in preaching,
and praying, and discipline, and yet no stewards nor Officers of the house who
have received the keys to feed.

Quest. 2. Whether it can be proved from the Old Testament, that Christ's
visible Church was gathered, and being fallen, restored to a visible
Church State, by this Church Covenant.

Our Reverend Brethren contend that the Church was ever gathered by this
Church Covenant.

The Author Way of the Churches of Christ in. N. Eng. chapter 1. sect. 1. Prop. 3.
says, that the Lord received Abraham and his children into the Church, by a
covenant, Genesis 17. 7. Then when they violated the covenant, he renewed this
covenant, Exodus 19. 1. 5. whence they were called the Church in the
Wilderness, Acts 7. 38.

Answ. 1. The covenant, Genesis 17. 7. is not a Church Covenant such as you dream
off. 1. That covenant is the covenant of grace, made with all the people of the
Jews, yea, with children of eight days old, v. 7. I will establish my
covenant betwixt me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for
an everlasting covenant, to be a God, to thee, and to thy seed. Your covenant
is not made with infants, for to you infants are not members of the Church
visible, none are in your Church Covenant, but believers, of whose sound
conversion you are satisfied in conscience: 2. This is the everlasting covenant
made with Job, Melchisedech and many Believers; not in Church State, as you
grant, your Church Covenant made with a visible Church, is no everlasting
covenant. 3. Infants can make no confession ere they be receied in a visible
Church. 4. If by this covenant Abraham's house was made a visible Church and all
his children circumcised, then every family in the New Testament professing the
Faith and covenant made with Abraham, and baptized as Abraham's children were
circumcised, are the visible Church, and the place is for us. 5. Abraham and
his house before this, when they were first called out of Egypt, were a Church
of called ones professing the Faith of the Messiah to come Esai. 51. 1. 2, 3.
Josh. 24. 2, 3, 4.
6. The Lord had a Church visible, before the renewing of the covenant at Mount
Sinai, Exodus 19. even in Egypt and when he brought them first out of that Land
of bondage. Jerem. 31. 31, 32. 33 and before this they did celebrate the
Passover, the very night, that they came out of Egypt, Exodus 12. and therefore
it is false, that for that covenant renewed, Exodus 19. They are called the
church in the Wilderness, all the forty years that they were in the
Wilderness, they were the Church in the Wilderness, The apology Apology chapter
3. c. 4. 5.
and Discourse of the Church covenant. fol. 5. 6.
Author of the Church Covenant and Manuscript The way of the Church ib.
allege Deuteronomy. 29. 10. Ye stand all of you this day before the Lord, and c. v.
12. that thou might enter in covenant with the Lord thy God, and the Oath
which the Lord thy God makes with thee, v. 13. That He may establish thee to
day a people to Himself. Hence they argue, That which makes a society a
people to God, to serve Him in all His Ordinances, that is that whereby a
society is constituted in a Church State; but by a covenant, God makes a
society a people to God, to serve Him in all his Ordinances; Ergo. Now that
those were a true visible Church they prove, though the word say they had eyes
and see not, etc. yet they were not in a carnal estate, but only dull and slow
of hearkening, to discern sundry gracious dispensations, which sinful defects
were in the Lords Apostles, Mat 8. 17. dull and slow of Heart, for this was the
Generation which was not excluded out of Canaan, for their unbelief, whose
carcasses fell not in the wilderness, and they were now within the space of a
month or thereabout, to enter into the promised Land, Deuteronomy. 1. 3. and it was
they who entered by Faith, and subdned Kingdoms, and kept their children poor
and constant in Gods worship all the days of Josuah 24. 31. It is true (say
they) Apolog, c. 3.
God entered also into a covenant with their Fathers 40, years before, but not
till he had humbled them to a conscionable (though a legal) fear of His great
Name; and even some of them also (it may be) remembered that they were borne
under the covenant of grace, from the Loins of Abraham, though needful it was
that God should enter with them into a new covenant, and lead them from the Law
to Christ, because they had so long degenerated from the spirit and ways of
Abraham, during their abode in Egypt, Exodus 20. 7, 8.

Answ. This place makes both against the constitution of a visible Church, and
against the Church-Oath framed by cu^ brethren, Therefore once, for all, it
must be vindicated; and 1. I answer, the swearing of a covenant in truth by
sound faith puts person^ in state of membership, with the invisible and true
body of Christ; it is true, but not in the state of a Church as visible, and
therefore the Major of the first syllogism it false, it is one thing to be a
member of the Church as true, and of the people internally in covenant with
God, or a Jew in the Heart; and another thing to be in covenant externally and
a member of the visible-Church, to be borne a Jew and circumcised, and to
profess the doctrine of Moses his Law did formally make persons members of the
Jewish visible Church, though they should never swear this covenant, as many
died in Egypt, and lived and died members of the Jewish Church, and did eat
the Passover, and were circumcised, whose carcasses fell in the Wilderness,
because of their murmuring, these did never swear, neither this covenant,
Deuteronomy. 29. nor the covenant Exodus 19. 2. Here is a people in carnal estate and
cannot be a covenanted, and churched society of Saints, for v. 3. the Lord
objecteth to them habitual hardness. 3. The great temptations that thine eyes
have seen, the signs and these great miracles. 4. Yet the Lord has not given
you an Heart to perceive, and eyes to see and ears to hear (...) to this same
day; this is an habitual blindness, propagated from fathers to sons as Ez^.
2. 3. They and their fathers have rebelled against me (...) even to the body
of this day. Jerem. 25. 3. and Jeremy 3. 25. we have sinned we and our fathers
from our youth to this day. Now this is not the state of the Disciples, Mar. 8.
for Christ is not judging them of their state, as if they were yet carnal, but
of their faithless actions, in some particular: when they wanted bread, they
distrusted the Lord, when I brake the five Loaves amongst many thousands, how
many baskets took ye up? Christ rebukes them, that they were yet hardened,
notwithstanding some great miracles which might have induced them to believe he
would furnish them with bread, But this people was hardened, (I mean not of
them all, but of the greatest part) against all the means of grace, though
Moses, by a Synecdoche, mention only signs, temptations and miracles, yet he
understands and means no less, then they were disobedient to all Gods
dispensation of means, since the time that God first sent Moses to Pharaoh,
and preached the covenant to them, Exodus 4. 3, 4, 5. Exodus 6. 6, 7. and
therefore names he Pharaoh and Egypt with a note of universality, ye have
seen all which the Lord did to Egypt, and to Pharaoh and therefore this is an
universal habitual hardness, and cannot be their infirmity. 3. This is his
expression in the like style, Ez^. 12. 2. Esa. 6. 9. 10. Mat. 13 15.

4. This interpretation of our Brethren does but help Arminians, our Divines
say against it, Iunius anal. Deuteronomy. 29. non dederat vobis co^ ad res visas and

5. The Author of Discourse of the church covenant fol. 5.
the Church Covenant says, they were generally a generation of Believers, but
this covenant is made universally with all, as is clear, it is made with
Israel, Captains, Tribes, Officers, little ones, Wives, children, strangers,
the absents, and these who are not borne, v. 10. 11, 12, 13, 14. Now I ask, if
all these were satisfied in their consciences, of one another salvation, as
our Way of the church chapter 1. sect. 2.
Author requires, in fit materials of a visible Church; It was impossible,
Ergo, this is not the Church Covenant of converted persons, known to the
conscience of Moses, to be converted. 2. Moses says expressly of the same
generation, chapter 31. 20. That when they were come to the holy Land, they would
serve other Gods, and provoke God unto wrath. And of that same generation God
says, v. 21. For I know their imaginations, which they go about even now
before I have brought them unto the Land which I swear; this was (as you say)
about a month before their entry to the holy Land. 27. I know thy rebellion
and thy stiffe-necke (says Moses) behold while I am yet alive, this day, ye
have been rebellious against the Lord, how much more then after my death? were
they all then a generation, who by faith subdued kingdoms? Surely this was but
verified in their holy Judges, like Ioshuab, and some few others; it is true
they did not prosessedly in Ioshuabs days make defection, yet they Were not
all renewed, (as our brethren say) for Ioshuab says** chapter 24. 14. Put away the
strange Gods, which your fathers served in the other side of the flood, and in
Egypt, and serve the Lord. v. 23. Now therefore put away the strange gods,
which are amongst you. And that song of Moses, chapter 32. was made for the
conviction of the present generation. chapter 31. 22, 23, 24, 25. Now in this song
much is said of corrupting themselves, serving idols, forgetting of the rock,
and father who begat them, their sacrificing to devils, and therefore such
were not generally such as subdued Kingdoms by fath, and by faith entered into
Canaan, as ye say. And so also (say we) our Churches under the New Testament,
though consisting of a mixed multitude, are rightly constituted, and true
visible Churches; therefore this covenant is not the formal being and essence
of a Church. And what sort of people were they when the Lord covenanted with
them in Hore^, Exodus 20. A generation who grieved the Lords Spirit, tempted him
in the Wilderness, offered to stem Moses, committed idolatry, would appoint
themselves a Captain to return back to Egypt, lusted in the Wilderness,
distrusted the Lord, and could not enter in through unbelief, and their
carcasses fell in the Wilderness, and three and twenty thousand were slain
for fonnication. And therefore there is no ground that Moses first or last made
a Church covenant only with some selected and choice persons, partakers of the
heavenly calling, heirs annexed with Christ, Kings, and Priests unto God, for
all promiscuously were the materials of this Church; yea those, who were not
borne, and the absents, Deuteronomy. 29. 10. Ye stand this day, all of you before the
Lord your God, your Captains of your Tribes, you Elders, and your Officers,
with all the men of Israel. V. 11. Your little ones, your wives, and the
stranger that is within thy gate, from the h^wer of Wood, to the drawer of
Water. V. 12. That thou should enter into covenant with the Lord thy God,
etc. Now were Moabites and Amonites made members of the Jewish Church, and all
the strangers? then they must enter into the Temple; how then are they
forbidden to enter into the congregation of the Lord, to the tenth generation?
You admitted not to your Church covenant in New England all professors, here
none are excepted; this covenant is made with absents, and those who are not
yet borne; now those who are not personally present, and those who are not yet
come into the world, can make no restipulation of a covenant with God, nor can
be the fellow members of the Church, except you make persons invisible to be
visible members of a visible Church.

6. There is far less ground to say, that because they had degenerated from
the spirit and ways of Abraham, by idolatry, it was fit that God should renew
a covenant with this generation, and so make them a visible Church; for this is
as fitting to say, a sick man in whom there is a living soul, is made a
living man by the entering of a new living soul in his body, for before this
covenant the people was the Church visible in the Wilderness; the renewing of
a covenant may quicken a decaying life of God in some, but it cannot give the
being, and essential form of a visible Church, to that which before was a
visible Church.

7. Papists would be glad that we should put this in print, that there is a
time when God has no visible Church on earth at all, Bellarmin, Stapleton,
Pererius, and others lay this upon us, but unjustly. It would gratify
Arminians as Episcop. disp. 27. thesi, 8, 9, 10.

and Ostorodius, to say that Christ may be a King and head, a husband and
redeemer, and yet have neither subjects, members, spouse, nor redeemed people,
and that it may fall out that Christ have no Church on earth; for the laying
hold on the covenant gives being and life to the Church, as the body of Christ
and his true spouse, as well as it gives being to the visible Church,
according to ou^ brethrens doctrine, and if this covenant cease, there is not a
Church of Christ on earth.

8. We have heard nothing here as yet, but the covenant of grace, and no
Church Covenant. But says the Author of the Church Covenant, (g) Though it be
indeed the covenant of grace, and made principally with God; it follows not
hence, that it is not a covenant of the members amongst themselves, for the
covenant of God tyeth us to duties to our neighbor, and to watchfulness, and
edification one of another, Levit. 19 17. Deuteronomy. 29. 18. the neglect whereof in
the matter of Achan, brought sin on all the congregation, Josh. 7. yea it
tieth us to duties to children not yet borne, who shall after become members of
the Church, when Iehojadah made a covenant betwixt the King and the people; it
was but a branch of the Lords covenant, obliging the King to rule in the Lord,
and the people to obey in God.

Answ. 1. But if particular duties to our brethren bind us by a new
Church Covenant, because Gods covenant commands these duties, then because
Gods covenant commands sobriety toward our selves, and righteous dealing
toward our brethren, there is required a selfe-covenant toward your selves,
for temperance and sobriety toward your selves, as there is required a
Church Covenant to bind you to duties to those who are in Church membership
with you, this no man can say, nor can several duties require several
covenants. 2. It is true when we enter into covenant with God, we swear duties
to all to whom we are obliged, but then we are made members of the visible
Church, before we swear this Church Covenant; and this is, as if Abraham were
made a living man before he have a reasonable soul, and as if Abraham were
Israel his father, before Israel be Abraham his son, for if Abraham be
in-Churched when he did swear the covenant of grace, (as the Author grants)
then he must be a member of a visible Church, while as yet there is not a
visible Church; to which Abraham is tied; I deny not but Israel may swear
obedience to all Gods covenant, and all duties therein, and that he may swear
also in particular, to perform all duties to Abraham his father, in another
oath, but that he cannot enter in the state of relation of sonneship to his
father, while he swear that oath in particular, is a dream which hardly can
be conceived.

3. The peoples finne in not warning Achan was a finne against a duty of the
covenant, exacting obedience of all in brotherhead, though not in a
Church State, Levit. 19. 17. and Job and his friends who were members of no
visible Church, (as you say) did perform this, one to another, Job 4. 3 4. Job
2. 11. Job. 4. 1. 4. The covenant that Jehojadah made betwixt the King and the
people, will prove the lawfullnesse of a covenant to perform Church-duties,
beside the general covenant of grace, which we deny not, but does not prove,
that a covenant to Church-duties is the essential form of Church Membership,
and the only way, by Divine precept, of entering persons in a Church State; for
persons already in Church State may, upon good reasons, swear a covenant to
these duties, yet are they not of new inchurched to that congregation, whereof
they were members before.

Their next principal argument as ( Apology c. 4.
) the Apology says, if a Church Covenant be the essential form of a Church,
as a stock of Saints is the material cause, then the Church Covenant is
necessary to the being of the Church, and it is that whereby Ecclesia integra
constituitur, collapsa restituitur, and quo sublato Ecclesia dissolvitur and
destituitur, that is, it is by this covenant a Church is instituted in its
integrity, and when it is fullen, it is restored to its integrity, and when
this covenant ^eas^th, the Church is no longer a visible Church.

Answ. When a Church falls it is not restored to the state of a visible
Church by circumcision, and yet circumcision is given as a sign of a covenant
betwixt God and his Church, Genesis 17. 11. nor is a Church restored by Baptism,
or Baptizing over again, and yet Baptism is that whereby we are entered
members of the visible Church. 2. When persons fail in omitting Church duties;
I think they fail against your Church-Oath, yea when they fall into any sin
that may be a scandal to others, yea the finne of adultery, yet if they repent
and hear ^he Church, they are not excommunicated, neither do they ^ose the
right of Church Membership and right to the seals of the covenant, nor is it
needful they be restored by renewing a Church Covenant, but we desire to hear
from Gods word proofs of the singular virtues of this Church Covenant. 3.
Discipline is by all Divines thought necessary to the well being of a Church,
but not to the simple being thereof, and for this we apeale to the learned
Parker who denies Parker de polit. l. 1. c. 17.
Discipline to be an essential note of the visible Church, and cites
Cartwright adversus Harrin. sonum.
Cartwright for this, and therefore says that Calvin, Bortrandus de Logues,
Mornaeus, Martyr, Marloratus, Galusius, and Beza omitteth discipline amongst
the notes of the Church.

The apology adds Apology chapter ^.
if the national Church of the Jews was made a national Church by that
covenant, and thereby all the Synagogues had Church Fellowship one with another
in the Temple, then the congregationall Church is made a visible Church by that
covenant. 2. Also the fallen Church of the Jews was restored to a Church State
(say they) by renewing a covenant with the Lord in the days of Asah and
Hezekiah, and these who fell to Judah 2 Chronicles. 9. 25. are commanded not to
stiffen their necks, or (as in the original) to give their hand unto the Lord,
that so they might enter into the sanctuary 2 Chronicles. 30. and 8.

Answ. Is it credible or possible, that all the Synagoues of so many hundred
thousand people, as were in the 12. Tribes were all satisfied in conscience,
anent the regeneration one of another^ and this is required of you to the right
swearing of a Church covenant, else how could they in the Oath join themselves
to all Israel, as to a Generation of Saints? ^^ Israel before this Oath, was
circumcised, and had eaten the Passoyer, and so was a visible Church before,
yea then God had no Church visible before this Oath, which is against Gods
promise made to David, and his seed, Psalm. 89. 28. ^9. Also in Abijahs days
Judah was the true Church of God, 2 Chronicles. 13. 8. And now yet think to
withstand the Kingdom of the Lord in the hands of the sons of David. 10. But
as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken Him. 3. The
inchurching of members is a Church-action, as all the Church casts out, so
all the Church receives in, as you Way of the Church chapter 3. ^ct. 1.
say, but the putting of Judah and the strangers of Israel to this Oath, was by
the Kings authority, who convened them, 2. Chron. 15. 9. And Asah gathered all
Judah, and Benjamin, and the strangers with them, and they were compelled by
the Royal sanction of a civil Law to this covenant, v. 12. and they entered
into covenant, etc.

13. That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel, should be put to
death, whether small or great, man or woman. 4. How were they all in,
conscience satisfied anent the regeneration one of another, 1. Being such a
number of Judah, Benjamin and strangers out of Ephraim, Manasse and Simeon, v.
9. Were. 2. Gathered together and meet but one day? 5. This covenant obliged
young ones, your covenant seeks no Church duties of little ones, for to you
they are not members of a visible Church. 6. The place, 2 Chronicles. 30. 8. (...)
yield to God as servants Juni^^ in annot. prostrati auxilium cjus imploran^es.
Iunius, humbly imploring his help, as the same phrase is Lament. 5. 6. we have
served the Egyptians (...), and the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread,
neither does the Text say in infinitive, that ye may enter into the Sanctuary,
as if a renewed covenant were a necessary preparation, before they could enter
into the Sanctuary; but it is set down as an express Commandment of the King
(...) enter ye into his Sanctuary, and there is not a word of a covenant in
the Text, but only of the peoples keeping the Passover, and though there had
been a covenant (of which the Spirit of God, speaking so much of Iosiah's
zealous Reformation, would not have been silent) it is not to a purpose Judah
was a visible Church, before Hezekiah wrote Letters to them, to ^ome to
Jerusalem; to keep the Passover, as is clear chapter 29. 17. they begun to
sanctify the House, the first day of the first month, and all the
congregation worshipped. 36. And Hezekiah rejoiced at their zeal, and so there
was a visible Church, and the Passover was eaten the 14. day according to the
Law, also in all covenants renewed by the people of the Jews, the matter was
done suddenly, and all convened in a day, when a voluntary preparation, and
evidenced regeneration, could not be evidenced to the satisfaction of the
conscience of all the people; nor can this preparation be called Jewish and
temporary, for it is as moral to all who swear Churches duties one to
another, as the covenant it self, which our brethren say, is of perpetual
equity. And all these may be answered to the covenant, Neh. 10. where there is
no insinuation of Church duties, but in general. 29. Yo walk in Gods Law, and
to observe and ^^e all the Commandments of the Law, and not to marry strange
^vives.

The apology Apolog. ubi supra.
says it is to no purpose that the people. 2 Chro, 15. was a Church before
this covenant, because the place is not alleged to prove that a people are
made a Church by entering into covenant with God, but to prove that a decayed
Church is restored by a covenant, now the Church at this time was corrupted
with idols, sodomy, etc.

Answ. 1. Yet it proves well that this covenant is not the formal cause of a
visible Church; for a visible Church has not its formal being, before it has
its formal cause. 2. The convening of all the people to swear, is an act of
the Church visible, now nothing can have operations, before it have the formal
cause. 3. The Author says, who knows that all the Tribes of Israel were yet
in covenant with God, from the days of their Fathers? Answer; I think that it
is easily known, that they used and exercised many Church actions also, and so
were a Church visible of a promiscuous multitude, and it is know^n that none
were excluded from this covenant, none selected and chosen out as Regenerates,
who only were thought fit to swear this covenant, and so that it is not your
Church Covenant that all were forced to, and commanded under pain^ of death, to
attest.

Our brethren, as first The way of the churches of Christ in New England chapter 3.
sect. 4.
our Author, secondly Apolog. c 5.
the Apology, thirdly the Author of the Church Covenant, repose much on Isai.
56. 3. where the stranger is joined to the Lord, in a personal covenant, for
his own salvation, for so the Text says v. 3. 4. yet are they not joined to
the visible Church, while they lay hold on the covenant, that is, to swear a
Church Covenant, now that they are not members of the visible Church is clear
f^r Deuteronomy. 23. 1, 2, 3. The Moabit, Ammonite, though never so holy, cannot be
members of the visible Church, because they are discharged, to enter into the
congregation of the Lord. 2. They complain^ that they are not of the visible
Church. The Lord has separated me from his people. 3. Adjoining of them to the
visible Church is promised; as a reward of their faith and obedience, v. 8.
even a Name in Gods House, Hence it is clear, persons under the New Testament
have a promise and propbecy th^^ if they be inward^s joined by faith God shall
give them a Name of Church Membership amongst his people, by swearing a
Church-Oath, or if they lay hold on the covenant of the Church.

Ans. 1. There is no churching here of strangers and Eunuchs Author of the
discourse of church covenant. fol. 12.
by Church-Oath, but as Calvin Musculus in comme. Gualther in loc.
Calvin, Musculus, Gualter, Iunius annot.
Iunius, observe, the Eunuch and stranger are comforted that under the Messi^hs
Kingdom, they shall have no cause to complain of their ceremonial separation
from Gods people and the want of some ceremonial privileges of that kind,
because the stranger and Eunuch shall have. v. 5. an everlasting room, and
honor in Gods House, and the Son of the stranger a place in the Catholic
Church v. 6. 7. so being, they believe and obey. But 1. v. 6. to lay hold on my
covenant is not to lay hold on the Church Covenant; give us precept, promise,
practice, or one syllable in Gods Word for this interpretation. 1. v. 4. to
take hold on the covenant is to believe the covenant, and not to swear a
vocal Oath. 2. To lay hold on the covenant, says Musculus ib.
Musculus, is to keep the covenant, and not to depart from it, to live
according to it, Iunius annot
says Iunius) and to rest on God, to do what is Gods will commanded in the
covenant (says) Calvin com.
Calvin, and Gualter.
Gualter) and so all who spoke sense on that place, and never one dreamed of a
Church Covenant before. 3. God says of it ( my covenant) there is no reason
then to call it a Church Covenant here more then Ierom. 31. 32. 33. Psalm. 25.
10. Isai. 55. 3. Ierem. 50. 5. Zach. 2. 11. 4 Laying hold on the covenant is
not an external, professed, vocal, visible and Church embracing of the
covenant, for then the Lord promises to the Eunuch the name of a faithful
visible fellow member, in a congregation, if he shall lay hold on the covenant,
and swear it in the Church assembly, this Church-swearing is not rewarded so,
for how is it proved that a name, even an everlasting name, better then the
names of sons and daughters, is the name of a fellow-member in some obscure
congregation or parish? is this better then the name of a borne Jew, who was
also a member of the visible Church, and if he believed in Christ, had also the
everlasting name of a member of the Jewish Church? Surely there is no ground
for this in Gods Word, the everlasting name must be some spiritual remembrance
and some invisible honor beyond the external honor of being named the son
or daughter of a Jew, and by what warrant also of Gods word is Gods holy
mountain and his house of Prayer. v. 7. which in the New Testament can no more
be literally expounded, then offering of burnt offerings by what warrant is
this called a parochial visible congregation, where visible saints meets in
one material house ordinarily, and in one visible Church Way? The house of
Prayer there, is Joh. 2. expounded of the typical Temple, which spiritually
did typifie Christ's body, as he expounds it himself, Ioh. 2. 18, 19, 20.
dear brethren do no violence to Gods Word.

2. There is no ground that the Eunuch and stranger had no other complaint, but
want of visible membership: for his laying hold on the Lords Sabbaths says the
contrary, and though he should complain of that, it is a small comfort
promised, th^^ he shall be a member of a visible congregation, which membership
many Iudasses and Hypocrites enjoy also. 3. Though there were a visible
Church Membership here promised (as no intepreter that ever yet saw it, but
your selves) yet it should only follow, before heathen, who are come to age,
be Baptized, and so inchurched, they should externally lay hold on a professed
covenant, and so, that they might be members of the invisible Church, before
they be members of the visible Church, which is much for our Baptisme-covenant,
and nothing for your Church Covenant. 4. Church Membership, by your exposition,
Regul. j^ris conditionatum ^ihil ponit, nisi ponatur conditio.
is promised to none, but these, who inwardly by true faith are joined to the
covenant; then all Church-Acts performed by pastors and professors not
converted, though they proceed, clave no^ errante, following Christ his rule
are null, and no bapti^ing, no binding in heaven, for a promise conditional is
no promise (say reason and lawyers) where the condition is not fulfilled.

The Author of the Church Covenant Discourse of the Church covenant art. 1.
cites that of Ez^k. 16. 8. I entered into covenant with thee, and thou
becamest min^, Eze. 20. 37. I will cause you to pass under the rod; here is a
covenant, not of a person, but of the whole House of Israel, v. 30. 39. This
covenant is called a band, and Junius observes well, takes from shepherds,
who went amongst their sheep with a Rod, and selected and poynted out such as
were for the Lords sacrifice, Lev. 26. 31. Ergo, under the New Testament, men
enter not into the Church, hand over head, but they pass under the Rod of due
trial, and then, being ^ound meet, are inchurched.

Answ. He entered into covenant with Jerusalem, dying in her own blood, v. 6.
v. 8. your covenant is made with a people washed and converted. 2. All are
taken in promiscuously in this covenant externally, good and evil, who
prospered to a kingdom, and were renowned amongst the Heathen, v. 13. 14. Your
Church covenant is of persons who pass under the rod of pro^ation, and pass
for sound converts.

The other place is not to a purpose, for God is not speaking of gathering his
people to a visible Church, but as Calvin.
Calvin Pola^. com.
Polanus, Iunius.
Iunius, God is meeting with the peoples wicked conclusion, who said, v. 34.
They were banished and cap^ives mixed amongst the Nations, and so free from
Gods cor^ecting rod, or band of Discipline, and God says, and I will make you
to pass under the Rod (...), and I will bring you under the ^and of my
covenant; The Word is also Psalm. 2. 3. and it is true that (...) signifies a
staff and a rod, Prove. 10. 13. but it signifies also a Kings Scepter, Genesis
49. 10. but the band of the covenant signifies no union of a visible Church,
nor is the Lord in that place promising the mercy of a gathered Church, but by
the contrary, he threatens an evil, as v. 35. And I will bring you unto the
wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face, 36.
Like as I peaded with your Fathers 37. And I will cause you to pass under the
Rod, etc. To select you out from amongst the Heathen, as sheep for sacrificing,
as the next verse. 38. and I will purge out from amongst you the Re^^lls, etc.
This place is violently brought to witness unjustly: And what though God would
have them tried, who were taken under his covenant of protection? it should be
the covenant of grace, and not a Church Covenant, for he means no such thing.

They allege, Jerem. 50. 4. And in those days, and at that time, the
children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, saying
let us be joined to the Lord, in a perpetual covenant, that shall not be
forgotten.

Answ. 1. Israel and Judah together cannot be a parochial congregation; nor 2.
Can Sion be a parish Church; nor 3. is the Church Covenant, from which a man is
loosed, when upon good warrants, and the consent of the congregation, he
removes cut of that Church to another, A perpetual Covenant that shall never
be forgotten; for eternity is proper to the covenant of grace betwixt God and
man, Jerem. 31. 33, 37, 38. Jerem. 32. 40. Isal. 54. 10. Isai. 55. 3. Isai. 59.
21. and there is no covenant betwixt mortal men, who shall d^e, an eternal
covenant.

The Author Discourse of a Churchcovenant, ^ol. 23.
says, There is nothing more plain then Isai. 44. 5. One shall say, I am the
Lords; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall
subscribe with his hand, and surname himself by the name of Israel: These
words are so plain as nothing can be more plain.

Answ. This is a clear place, that under the M^ssiah all people shall profess
themselves in covenant with God, and the children of God and the Church, and
Calvin praelect. ^b.
Calvin cites Psalm. 87. 5. and of Sion it shall be said, This and this man was
borne in her. but this is not plain at all, that these profess themselves
sworn members of a particular Parish; yea, the contrary is most plain, that
they shall call themselves by the name of Jacob and Israel; that is, children
of the whole visible Church, for Jacob and Israel is not restricted to one
particular congregation. Before the peoples captivity, says Musculus, Musculus
com. Isai. 44.
The names of B^^l and idol gods sounded in their mouths, but then they shall
profess the true God, and that they are his people. Now Gods covenant is made
principally, not with one single congregation, not is the blood that seals
the covenant shed for one single congregation; nor are the promises of the
covenant, Yea and Amen is Christ, for one single flock only, and primo and
principaliter, but for the whole Catholic Church, and therefore they shall
name themselves Christians.

The Author adds, Discourse of the Church covenant. f. 9.
Every Church is Christ's married Spouse, united to Christ by covenant, the
violation of marriage is the violation of a covenant; yea, and there is a
marriage betwixt the Church- members, Isa. 62. 5. as a young man marries a
Virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee.

Answ. A marriage betwixt Christ and his Church we grant and betwixt Christ and
every particular soul believing in him, in respect of the love. 2. mutual
interest and claim one to another, Cant. 2. 16. and what holds betwixt
Christ and a Church catholic, or particular, holds also betwixt Christ and
every soul, and to extort a Church covenant betwixt Christ and a particular
soul, who may be and often is a believer, and yet out of Church State, from
the borrowed phrase of marriage, is ^oo violent blooding of comparisons; and
therefore from marriage belonging to the catholic Church principally, how can
a marriage visible be concluded? 2. the sonne^ are the whole Church of the
Gentiles; too large a P^rish incolaeterrae, says Musculus, Musculus.
and excellently Calvin, Calvinus pr^l^ct. ^^^o sic Deus Ecclesia m^^itus est,
ut Ecclesie sue maritet ^^nes p^pulos, qui ad came aggregantur.
Christ so is the husband of his Church, that he marries upon his Church all
people and Nations which are gathered to her, because while the Church wants
children, she is as it were a widow; now this is nothing for a Churchcovenant.
Thirdly, there is a relative obligation of mutual duties of love betwixt
fellow members of a visible Church, and betwixt sons and the mother
congregation; but this is first done in Baptism expressly; secondly, in our
coming to be members of such a congregation, but the person is before a member
of the visible Church.

The Author adds Author of the Churchcovenant.
If dissolving a covenant be that which dissolveth a Church, as Zach. 11. 9.
10. then the making of a covenant is that which constituteth a Church; if
dissipating of stones unbuild the house, then compacting of them together does
build the house; but the breaking of the covenant under the name of breaking of
the two staves, beauty and bands, Z^ch. 11. is the inchurching of the Jews,
Ergo;

Answ. The dissolving and breaking of the covenant of grace, and the removing
of the Candlestick, and the Word of God, Revel. 2. 5. Am^s 8. 11, 12. takes
away the being of a Church, both as a true Church, and as a true visible
Church; and of such a breaking of the covenant does the Lord speak Zach. 11.
v. 9. and I said I will not feed you; that which dies, let it die; and that
which perishes, let it perish, etc. and it takes away the union of
brotherhead amongst the members, verse, 14. so the thing in question is not
hence concluded; for the question is, if a Churchcovenant make a Church as
visible, and the breach of that Church Covenant unmake and dissolve a Church as
visible, and this place proves what makes and unmaketh a Church simply as a
Church, not as visible and under that reduplication.

Quest. 3. Whether by testimonies from the new Testament, and good reasons, a
Church Covenant can be evinced.

Our Author The way of the Churches, chap. 3. sect. 4. prop. 3.
alleges, 2 Cor. 11. 2. I have espoused you to one husband, that I may
present you as a chaste virgin to Christ; so also the Apology, Apology chap.
6.
this was nothing else but the planting of the Church at Corinth; if you say
this Paul did while he converted them to the grace of Christ by his ministry;
if this were true, says he, then should Christ have many thousands, hundreds,
and scores at least of spouses in one Church, which we think inconvenient.
Secondly, it is plain he speaks of the whole Church as of one spouse, and as
it were one chaste Uirgin; which argues, he persuaded them all (as the friend
of the bridegroom) to give up themselves with one accord as one man into one
body, to the fellowship and worship of the Lord Jesus.

Answ. it is a weak cause, that hangs upon the untwisted thread of a
misapplied metaphor. For 1. espoufing into Christ in the Text is opposed to
being deceived and corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ, as Evah was
deceived by the serpent, and opposed to the receiving of another spirit, and
another Gospel; so then to be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ,
and to receive another Gospel, must have this meaning; as Evah was deceived by
the Serpent, so I fear that your simple minds be un-Churched and loosed from
the visible Church of Corinth, and that you forget your covenant, wherein ye
swear to take Christ for your husband, and me for the friend of the
Bridegroom, and that you be remiss in the duties of external discipline; and
Church Fellowship, and in excommunicating scandalous persons, etc. A^ brethren,
let not our Lords word be thus tortured and wrested. 2. He expounds this
espoufing, the presenting of them to Christ in the day of God, as a washed,
redeemed, and saved wife of Christ, and not of their Church continuing in
visible society. Yea, all interpreters, ancient and modern, as Augustine,
Theophylact, Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Cyrillus, Ambrose, Our latter, Calvin,
Bullinger, Beza, Pom^ran, Pellicanus, Sarcerius, Marlorat, Paraphrastes,
Erasmus; and Papists, Aquinas, Haymo: give this sense. Paul as the friend to
the Bridegroom finding the Corinthians despising him, and in love with false
teachers, grew jealous of them for his Lords cause, that though he had
betrothed them to Christ, as a virgin hand fastened by promise to a husband,
left they should be drawn away to other lovers, by the cunning of false
teachers as Evah was led from her Lord, by subtle Satan. 3. Though he speak
of them, as of one body, spouse, virgin, how does it follow that he speaks of
them, as of a ministerial and a parochial body? for the marriage, the
betrothing to Christ, and the acts contrary, the receiving of another spirit,
the corrupting of their simple minds, are acts altogether spiritual,
internal, invisible, and acts of a Church, as a true Church, and the contrary
are acts of a false Church, as false, and not acts of a Church as visible, in a
visible meeting, in a visible external act of marrying, nor is their any
insinuation, that Paul feared the dissolving of the Church oath and visible
order of government. 4. It is not inconvenient, that there be many Spouses, as
in every true believer, there be many single acts of marriage love, and of
believing, and so of taking Christ for their husband and Lord. A visible Church
is the House of God, 1 Timothy 3. 15. the Temple of God, Rev. 3. 12. and yet every
believer is a Temple, 1 Cor. 3. 17. and every one His House; seeing he dwells
in them by says, Ephesians. 3. 17. also if this be a good reason, he speaks of
them all, as of one chaste virgin. Ergo, he speaks of them all, as of one
visible parochial Church. Then brethren, because Christ speaks, Joh. 3. 29.
of the whole Church of the new Testament, as of one bride of himself as the
bridegroom, and of the whole Catholic Church, that Christ has washen and
redeemed, as of one glorious Virgin, Ephesians. 5. 27. and of the one Lambs wife,
Revel. 21. 9, 10. it shall follow that the Catholic church is one visible
Church, and so one Parochial congregation, for you mock at a Catholic visible
Church, (as your Author does) who calls it Way of the Churches of Christ in
new England, chapter 1. sect. 2.
a Chimaera, though without reason. 5. And certainly twenty believers in one
house and so twenty hundred convened in one, yet out of Church State, are a
body married upon Christ in respect of his Spirit, and their faith laying hold
on him, as on their husband; yea, and the Church of Corinth, as Saints by
calling; and considered without the respect of a visible Churchfellowship, is
more properly Christ^ wife, and Christ their husband, then they can be called
Christ's wife, for an external communion of a visible profession, which is
common to them with many repro^ates; yea, there is no ground at all to call a
company, because of their visible profession, Christ's wife, no^ does Gods Word
speak so; the converted by Prophets not in office are most properly his wife;
and these may say, we have betrothed you to Christ; and be not deceived nor
corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ Jesus. Hence that place also is
not for our brethren, 2 Cor. 9. 12. The Apostle thanketh God for the
Corinthians professed subjection to the Gospel, in their liberal contribution.
Then (says the Apology Apology, chapter 11.
) here is a Church covenant; but if this professed subjection be a ground of a
Church Covenant, the Corinthians extended this charity to the poor a^
Jerusalem, as the Churches of Macedonia did also, then many particular
congregations are Church Members in Church Fellowship, with the Church of
Jerusalem; for they professed this subjection to the Gospel toward the
distressed at Jerusalem, and so Corinth exercised Church-acts toward other
Churches then their own; Independencie by this must fall. Secondly, to relieve
the poor is a duty of Christian charity, common to believers in Church State,
or not in Church State, how then can it prove a duty of Church State?

The Apology, chapter 11.
Apology adds, Hebr. 10. The Hebrews are commanded not to forsake the
assembly of themselves together, as the manner of some is; Ergo, they convened
by mutual consent, and so by covenant.

Answ. Do not Infidels and Indians, as you teach The way of the Churches of
Christ in New England, c. 3. sect. 2.
come to your Assemblies to hear the Word, and partake of the prayers and
praises of the Church? But ye will not say, They are to come to those
Assemblies by a Church Covenant. Secondly, what though they intended Assemblies
by consent, and tacit covenant? it will not follow therefore by your Covenant,
which is the formal cause of a visible Church, and this place proves nothing,
2 Cor. 8. 5. The Churches of Macedonia first gave themselves to the Lord, and
then to us, therefore they were In-churched, by way of covenant to our
ministry, so Discourse of the Church covenant, fo. 9.
the discourse; but these Churches gave themselves to God (in that duty of
charity) and then to us, the exhorters to that charity, and the conveyers
thereof to Jerusalem; then the Church of Corinth was married on God, on Paul,
yea and on the Churches of Jerusalem, for the Author makes this mariage-love,
and so Jerusalem is erected a mother Church, and Corinth subjected unto her;
for these who give Alms, as becomes saints, are said to give their heart to
God, and to the poor, as Isai. 53. 10. To draw out their heart to the poor,
and that because of their cheerful and compassionate giving. Our Author The
way of the churches c. 3. sect. 4.
says John Baptist repelled Scribes and Pharisees, and the profane multitude,
from his baptism, Luke 3. 7. Mat. 3. 7. and this was godly zeal, for they
were a generation of Vipers, Luke 3. 7. 8. and therefore they were not meet for
Baptism, which is a Baptism of Repentance, Luke 3. 3. Philip baptized not the
Eunuch while he made profession of faith. These and the like the Author and our
brethren bring to prove, that men are not inchurched but by confession
covenant-wayes, and also to prove that the matter of the Church should be
Saints by calling, hence Apolog. chapter 11.
The Apology cites Justin Martyr Justin Martyr apol.
who says three things were required of such* as were to be received into the

Answ. 1. Ye read not in the word that John Baptist rejected any from his
Baptism, who desired to be baptized, yea by the contrary, Luke 7. 29. It is
said, and all they that heard him, and the Publicans justified God, being
Baptized with the Baptism of John. v. 30. but the Pharisees and Lawyers
rejected the counsel of God, against themselves, being not baptized of John:
then the Pharisees and Lawyers refuse to be Baptized, and Mat. 3. 5. Then went
out unto him, Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the Regions round about
Jerusalem, confessing their sins, but when he saw many of the Pharisees and
Sadduces come to his Baptism, he said unto them. O generation of Vipers, etc.
But that he baptized, them by the same Sermon, is clear, for v. 8. He
exhorts them to Repentance, and v. 9. dehorteth them from a^ hypocritical
profession, v. 10. he threatens judgment to them, and v. 11. says, I did
baptize you with water, that (you) is relative, to these whom he called a
generation of Vipers, and includes them, for there is no ground in the Text to
exclude them, and Luke 3. 7. and he said to the multitude, that came forth to
be Baptized, O generation of Vipers, and c. v. 21. and when Also if you w^ge a
confession of faith before Baptism of all and every one, ourdivines from John
his Baptizing of all Judea, do prove the Baptizing of Infants, you call in
question with Anabaptists, if it be law full to Baptize Infants, and you make a
Church covenant necessarily requisite before Baptism, and so all Baptized must
be members of the visible Church, which you deny.
all the people was baptized, etc. Jesus also was Baptized. It is true, all
that were baptized, and come to age confessed their sins, but they were entered
members of the Christian Church by professing the covenant in baptism, and
their covenant was no Church Covenant, entering them members of a parochial
Church Oath, but entered them members of the whole visible Church, and they
were not tied to such and such Church-acts of prophesying and judicial binding
and loosing; Also could they all be satisfied in conscience of one another
regeneration, for they did not meet frequently together to prayer and
spiritual conference? 2. How could all Jerusalem and all Judea, Ma. 3. 5, 6.
and all the regions round about, and all the people baptized, Luke 3. 21. all
swear a Church Covenant, and give a particular confession of their sins to
the satisfaction of John Baptistes conscience? yea John says expressly of this
visible baptized Church, Mat. 3. 10. 12. that they were some of them fruitles
Trees to be hewn down, and some of them ch^ffe to be burnt with unquenchable
fire, so the materials of this baptized Church are not visible Saints, and
Lawyers hold of the covenant, as our brethren say. 2. The Eunuch coming to
Jerusalem to worship, (which is an act of a Churchmember) was in Church State
before he was baptized, and a Proselite. 3. It is true that you cite out of
Justin Martyr, but you omit a word (...) (says Martyr) a Baptisme-covenant and
professed by the heathen come to age, of which also only and of no other,
Iustine Martyr speaks, we wilingly acknowledge, but by that covenant they
were received unto the catholic visible Church, and not unto a single
independent Church only.

4. These Questions were propounded to the aged before they were baptized, and
reason that heathen be tried, before they be baptized, and in this we agree
with the Synod of Synod. Heideburg. c. 64.

and what Mr. Parker Parker de polit. Ecclesiast. l. 3. c. 16. 9, 4, 5.
says further of this kind may be admitted, if well expounded. 5. Zipperus
helps us, consuetum est, etc. He thinks it an ancient custom in the
primitive Church, that before any were received into the Church they should
give a confession, either themselves, or (says he) Parents and Tutors, and so
he acknowledges that infants in baptism were made members of the Church,
though they could not swear this Church Covenant, nor give evidences of their
conversion, and this is acknowledged by all the reformed Churches, of France,
Germany, Holland, Helvetia, Poland, England, Scotland, etc.

The Apology Apology chapter 6.
cites, Acts 5. 13. And of the rest durst no man join himself to them,
Greece, durst not be glewed to them, a word of marriage covenant, Mat. 19. 5.
and Acts 9. 26. Saul desired to be glewed to them, the former word must note
some voluntrary act of joining to the visible Church, and that different from
the act of conversion, for otherwise it is gross Armimainsme, to say that our
conversion depends upon our daring, or not daring, or that it is suspended
upon an act of our freewill, for it depends upon the omnipotent working of
the grace of God; and Saul Acts 9. 26. though converted, yea and baptized, yet
was he not received into the Churchfellowship, until they were better
satisfied of his spiritual estate, by Barnabas, hence it is an error, that to
be added to the Church is only to be converted to the faith, Ergo, a covenant
is requisite.

Answ. How strong is Gods truth, Brethren, ye make your opinion weak which
hangs upon a grammatication of one borrowed word, None durst join
mariage-way to the Church-visible; Erasmus in paraph.
Erasmus, Beza annot in loc.
Beza say it is a word translated from Trees glewed together, and signifies
neither marriage, nor covenant, and signifies either natural or artificial
or moral conjunction, Acts 8. 29. Philip is bidden join himself to yonder
Chariot, joining of Chariots is neither by marriage, nor covenant, so is the
word, Luke 15. 15. 2. It is not joined to a visible Parish Church, but to the
whole Christian Church out of which Ananias and Saphira were cast. v. 9. 10.
Which made great fear, and made those who were not baptized (says Pomeran.
comment.
Pomeranus) to fear to join to the Church of God, and so it behoved to be the
unbaptized and unconverted, who were feared, v. 12. and they were all with one
accord, in Salomons porch, that is, all the faithful added to the Church, now
opposite to these, he says of the unconverted and not added to the Church. v.
13. and of the ^est, without the Church, durst no man join himself to the
Church: now this cannot be in a visible society, for then Luke should intimate,
that the unconverted might have added themselves to the Church if they durst,
and had not been stricken with the terror of the miraculous killing of Ananias
and Saphira, now this they could not have done (as our Brethren say) hand over
head, they behoved first to be converted, and testified their conversion by a
Church Oath, nay Cajetan Cajetan. com. in loc.
says well, they durst not haunt their company, they sled from them, and from
the Apostle Peter, as from a man slayer, Nor does the holy Ghost (I think)
mean of any Church fellowship, he presupposing that they were unconverted, at
least our Brethren must say this. 3. It is an unlearned reason that they give
to prove, he means not of conversion, for all voluntrary acts supernatural
even of joining to a visible Church and marrying of themselves to Christ, and
his visible Church (as our Brethren say) are acts wrought by the irresistible,
and omnipotent working of Gods grace, no less then our first conversion; and
to think otherwise of our supernatural actions, is gross Arminianisme, for
so all who have written against Arminians as the learned Doctor Twisse,
Amesius, Pareus, Triglandius, have expounded that passage ( It is God who
works in us both to will and to do) so Calvin, Beza, Sibrandus, Pareus,
Ursine, Tilenus, Bucan, make all the operations of saving grace in conversion,
and after conversion, irresistible. And it is known how the Dominicanes,
Alvarez, Estius, Bannes Fran. Cumel, Matthew Rspolis, and many of that side
hold a predeterminateing operation of grace ad modum causoe Physicoe, which
begins before free will, so that no operations supernatural, yea nor
natural are suspended upon the liberty of freewill, and they hold againsti
Pelagianes, and the Jesuits, Snarez, Vasques, Valentia, Becan, Lod. Meratius,
Hyeron. Fasolus, Did. Ruiz; and if you suspend all voluntrary acts upon the
influence of freewill, you follow Pelagians, Jesuits, Socinians, and Arminians
in that point. 4. It is true the Disciples were afraid to admit Saul to their
society, and no wonder, for he had not long since made havoc of the Church;
but. 1. They did not inchurch him by an Oath. 2. They received him upon the
sole testimony of Barnabas v. 27. which order you keep not, refusing communion
to Christians of approved piety, and known so to you, because they cannot
swear your Church covenant. 5. Who they be, who think, to be converted to the
faith, and to be added to the visible Church, to be all one I know not; our
divines never said it. 6. Though all were granted you, they durst not join to
the apostolic visible Church; Ergo, there is a Church covenant, it is a great
consequent.

Now I desire to try your reasons for a Church covenant. It is not (says the
Apology) Apolog. c. 6.
hearty affection that uniteth Church Members in a visible Church, for so
England and Scotland are united, nor. 2. cohabitation, for Papists and
Protestants 1 Arg. from Reason.
may cohabite, and yet they are not of one visible Church, nor 2. Meeting in
one assembly uniteth not persons together, for infidels and Turks. 1 Cor. 14.
may come to Church Assemblies, and hear the word, Ergo, this union must be as
in all Bodies, Cities, Houses, Armies, by Covenant; none is made a Citizen to
have right to the privileges of the City, but by a Covenant, for when one is
received a member of an House or of an Army, or of any incorporation, (...) is
by a Covenant.

Answ. 1. The ennumeration is unsufficient, for the Seal of Baptism and a
profession of the truth, is that which makes one a member of the visible
Church. 1 Cor. 12. 13. for by one spirit, we are all baptized into one body,
and can you deny the covenant, which is sealed in baptism? and by this are all
the Citizens and Domestics inchurched and received into the visible Church,
and when one removes from one congregation to another, he makes a tacit
covenant to serve God in all his Ordinances with that new society, but he is
not thereby made a member of the visible Church; for that he was before: nor
has he right to the Seals, as they are Seals of such a Church, but as they
are Seals of the whole Catholic Church.

The Apostles (says the Apolo ib. ch 6.
apology) did two things when 2 Arg.
they planted Churches 1. They joined them together in a Church covenant. 2.
They constituted Elders in every Church, Acts 14 13. what the Apostles did,
after they converted their hearers, a baptizing, praying for them, laying on of
hands, exhorting, inchurching against persecuters, disputing against
adversaries, miracles* are acts tending to the good of the Church, not acts of
planting a Church.

Answ. 1. The first of these two is in question, we read not of such a
covenant, as our brethren speak of. 2. Converting of Souls after the Church
is constitute, is an adding to the Church, and preaching tends to this; The
Law of the Lord converteth, Psalm. 19. and when the Church is planted, it is not
a perfect house, but stones are fitted and laid upon the corner stone daily. 3.
That the Apostles act of planting is conversion and gathering to a visible body
by a covenant, we deny; for planting is an erecting of Professors and Judges or
Officer, whether they be converted, or not, so they profess the truth.

3. Arg. All Churches (says the discourse Discourse of the church covenant
^^l. 10. 11.
) are confounded, if there be not this Covenant to distinguish them, Smyrna is
not Ephesus or Thyatira, none of them is Laodicea. 2. Every one of them is
rebuked, for their own faults. 3. Faith or cohabitation does not distinguish
them., Ergo, this Church Covenant only does distinguish them.

Answ. Particular congregations differ not in essence and nature, as Church
covenants differ not in nature; only they differ in accidents and number, and
it is folly to seek differences, for Church covenants make not the difference;
for ^ Church covenant ia common to them all. 2. So Peter may be rebuked for his
fault, and John for his, yet Peter and John differ not in nature.

The apology Apology p. 11.
adds, it is not a Covenant simply and is general, that does constitute a
Church, or distinguish it from another, but a Covenant with application, or
appropriation, to these persons, as in marriage all promise these same duties,
yet a Covenant applied to this man, and this woman, makes this man such a
woman^ husband, and no other man.

Answ. If this be all, baptism and professed Faith applied to this man rather
then to this, shall as well distinguish persons and Churches, as Church
covenants, so applied. 2. This is not a good and fit division, so to
appropriate this Pastor to this flock, as he shall be a Pastor to no other
people, but to them, and everteth all communion of Churches and Saints and
denies the use of the Seals in this Congregation from all members of another
congregation whereas; God has made him a pastor in relation to the whole
visible Church on Earth, though his labors be tied to one determinate Church;
So Papists marry the Bishop and his Church, hence they thought it unlawsull for
a Bishop to d mit his Church in any case, for Enaristus Epis^ 2. de Episcopis
^j^ctis sicut vir non debet adul^erare uxorem suam, ita neque episcopus

3. Argu. A free people (says our Author) Way of the church chapter 1. sect. Prop.
3.

Relations, betwixt Parents and Children, Husband and Wife, no Church (says he)

can take charge of a stranger believer coming from another congregation,
unless he give himself, and offer his professed subjection to the Gospel,
also it is a part of the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, that every
one choose ^his own Pastor, Romans 14. 1. we are to receive a weak believer;
Ergo, he is to offer himself to the Church and to their order, by Covenant.

Answ. 1. It is true, the relation of Pastor and free people is founded upon a
tacit Covenant, but this Covenant is made in Baptism, for a pastor is a
pastor to yound children whom ^he received into Covenant, in baptism,
according to that, Acts 20. 28. feed the flock over which the Holy Ghost has
made you overseers, now infants are of these, because he is to feed them as a
pastor loveing Christ his lambs and young ones, no less then the aged. 2.
Because he exercised pastoral acts over young ones, when he baptizeth them,
yet infants are not under a ministry by a Church covenant. 3. The act of
election includes a tacit promise of subjection to the Minister, who is
elected, and the pastors acceptance of the Church-Office includes a tacit
promise to feed that flock, but this is no Church Covenant, which I prove by
one argument unanswerable. The Church Covenant (say our Brethren) is the
formal cause of our Churchmembership, and of a visible Church, as a reasonable
soul is the formal essence of a man, now the covenant that can intervene
betwixt a pastor elected, and a people electing, is a posterior and later by
nature, then a Church Covenant; for a people is a Church, as our brethren
teach) and so constitute in its full power of all Church operations, and so
has its entyre essence, and essential form, before they elect a pastor, as a
man must be a reasonable man, before he can exercise the second operations, or
actus secundos flowing from a reasonable soul. Therefore a Church and Pastor
d^e take charge of a stranger coming to the Congregation though there be no
Church Covenant, betwixt the Pastor and stranger, for the Church covenant is
prior to the coming of this stranger and has already constituted the Church
in its entyre essence and operations, though no stranger come at all, and
though that stranger never covenant to obey the Pastor, and the Pastor never
covenant to take care of that stranger. 4. Whereas it is said, It is a part of
the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, that every one choose his own
Pastor, I see not the truth of this in Scripture; The people has power to
choose, but that is a part of Christian liberty in this sense, I see not: the
Prophets and Apostles exercised pastoral acts over many who made not choice of
their Ministry, yea they preached to them against their will, and Paul
preached as a Pastor to many in Corinth, against their will, and a faithful
Pastor may preach to many, who never made choice of him for their Pastor, and
to whom the word is the savor of death unto death, and to whom he has
vengeance in readiness. 5. There is no liberty purchased to us by Christ, but
such as is regulated by Gods Word, and found reason, a liberty of sole will in
embracing or refusing a Minister, is license, not liberty: now in Christ, we
are called to liberty, not to license, and if some of a congregation wanting
the spirit of discerning upon prejudice, refuse a called pastor, to be their
pastor; yet if the most part of the congregation elect him, he is a pastor to
all, and to those who refused him, as Christ does reign in the word and
Ministry, over hypocrites, in a congregation, who say in their hearts we will
not have this man to reign over us; yet here is a Ministerial charge which a
pastor has lawfully over such, as are not willing to submit to that ministry:
the power of electing a pastor is not infallible; what if they or most of them,
upon sole groundless prejudice, refuse such a man to be their pastor, is he
not their pastor because all consent not? are we to think that Christ
purchased a liberty in his blood of refusing a called pastor? nor can we think
these who taught the doctrine of the Nicolaitans in Pergamus, and these who
held the doctrine of Balaam, or that the woman Jezebel which called her self a
prophetess in Thyatira, and seduced the people of God to commit fornication,
and to eat things sacrificed to Idols, were received in Pergamus and Thyatira
by a Church covenant; nor has it color of truth, that the faithful there
were satisfied in conscience, with the conversion of I^zabel, and such as held
the doctrine of Balaam, and that they consented, and did choose the Angel of
the congregation of Pergamus, and Thyatira (as our brethren speak) for their
pastor, and yet the pastors and Church are rebuked for not executing the
censures of the Church over the followers of Balaam, Revel. 2. 14, 15. and upon
Iezabel the false prophetess; Ergo they are not all such materials of a
visible Church, (as our brethren say) even saints by calling, and a Church does
well take the charge of those, who never offered their professed subjection to
Christ's Ordinances, we are not to think, that these who called themselves
Apostles, and yet were Liars, were visible saints approved in the sight of God
to the consciences of the Church of Ephesus, and that such did offer their
professed subjection to the Angel and Church of Ephesus, as you teach, yet
that Church took care of them, by the censures of the Church, and are
commended therefore, Revel. 2. 2. Thou can not bear them that are evil, and
have tried them, which say they are Apostles, and have found them liers. If a
false teacher shall come to a congregation, and be a hearer for some years,
and at length fall to, and teach pernicious Doctrine, will not the Church
censure him, labor to stop his mouth, yea and excommunicate him, that the
spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord? I think they cannot but exercise
some Church censures, and that the pastors convincing of such a gaine-sayer,
and a stopping of his mouth, is the very pastoral charge, laid upon Titus by
Paul, Tit. 1. 10, 11, 12. as is most clear v: 13. Rebuke them sharply, that
they may be sound in the faith.

Question 3. Whether or not, it be lawful for one, or many Quest. 18. sent

particular Churches, to swear a plate-forme, and prescribed vocal covenant,
called the confession of Faith, of such a Church.

It is a fit place, having spoken so much of a Church covenant, to speak of a
covenant of the faith of a Church; our Brethren being asked, what means have
you to preserve unity and verity.

Answ. 1. We have (say they) Scriptures. 2. The pastors, Epk^ 4. 11. and Gods
promise to lead them in all truth, Ierem. 32. 39. Ier. 16. 13. But this is not
a right Answer, for when we inquire of the means to preserve verity and unity,
we ask for the external means, whereby the Scriptures are kept, from false
glosses; it is true the Scriptures keep themselves from false interpretation:
but the Question is, by what external means do the Scriptures keep
themselves from false glosses?

The answer is not right, the Scriptures keep themselves from false glosse^,
by keeping themselves from false glosse^. Also the Question is by what means
do pastors keep unity amongst themselves. It is not right answered, that
pastors, by pastors, keep ^nity amongst themselves.

But we think a plat-forme (say ^ur Brethren ibid:) of doctrine and discipline,
or a confession of Faith, or doctrine according to godliness, may be made by any
Church or person, but (say they) ^^ plat-forme to be imposed on our selves or
others, as a binding Rule ^f faith, and practice, so that all men must believe
and walk according to that plat-forme, without adding, altering, or omitting,
we doubt whether such be lawful, or convenient. Whence our brethren con^emne
the swearing or subscribing by Oath, of a confession ^mposed or stinted by the
Church. Let these considerations be weighed.

1. Distinction, There is a principal and original and formal ^round of
faith which is the Word of God in the Old or New Testament, this is the only
persit and formal ground of Faith. 2. There is a secondary and material
ground of Faith, which is so far ^ ground of Faith and practice, as it agrees
with the Word ^f God.

2. Distinct. There is a confession which contains fundamentalls only, the
knowledge whereof is simply necessary for salvation, and the simple ignorance
whereof condemns; There is a confession which contains fundamentalls and
non -fundamentalls, which are not simply necessary to be known by all,
necessitate ^^edii.

3. Did. A confession of faith, is to be respected in regard of the matter,
which is Divine Scripture, or according to the style, conception and
in^erpretation, which is in some respect, humane.

4. Distinct. There is a confession of a particular man, what such a person, or
Church believes de facto, as the confession of ^^e Belgic Arminians, and a
confession de jure, what every one ought to believe, as the Nicen Creed, the
Creed of ^thanasi^s.

5. Did. There is a confession of a faith firm and sure, quoad ^ertitudinem
fidei, quoad substantiam articulorum credendo^um, sure in the Articles
believed, and a confession sure, quoad radicationem fidei in subjecto; the
first way all are obliged ^^ believe the Articles contained in the word, But we
see not, how now after the Canon of Scripture is closed, but the certainty of
faith, according to the measure of light more or less, as our Lord more or
less does reveal himself, in a more, or less measure of ligh: does not
grow, wo^, or decrease, according to the certainy of faith, the second way,
hence we say.

1. Conclusion, Only the Word of God is the principal and formal ground of
our Faith, Ephesians. 2. 20, 21, 22. 2 Timothy 3. 16. Luke 14. 25.

2. Concl. A confession of Faith containing all fundamental points, is so
far forth the Word of God, as it agrees with the Word of God, and obliges
as a rule secundary, which we believe with subjection to God, speaking in his
own Word, and to this plat-forme we may lawfullly swear.

1. What ever we are obliged to believe and profess as the saving truth of
God, that we may lawfully swear to profess, believe and practice, that the
bond of faith may be sure: but we are obliged to believe and profess the
national confession of a sound Church; Ergo. The proposition is clear, from
David's and the Saints practice who laid bands on their souls to tie
themselves to that which is lawful, as, Psalm. 119. 106. I have sworn, and will
perform it, that I will keep thy Righteous judgments. The major is the
doctrine of our Dvines, and clear, when they explain the matter of a lawful
Oath as Pareus Urfin. in mand. 3. q^. 102. art. 4.
Pareus 'Bucanus loco 45. quest. 6.
Bucanus Tilen. sint. disp. 42. in tert. pr^c^pt disp. 1 Thessalonians 17.
Tilenus, Profess. Leyd. synop. purior. theolog. disp. 38. These. 5.
Profess Leydens. Calvin in mand. 3.
Calvin, Iunius, Beza, Piscator, Zanchi^, etc. That things lawful, may
lawfully be sworn to GOD, observing other due circumstances. The assumption is
^^deniable.

2. Arg. That whereof we are assured in conscience to be the truth and true
Religion, bringing salvation to men's souls, to that we may tie our selves, by
an Oath, upon the former grounds. But the sound confession of faith, set down
in a platform^ is such, as we may and are to be assured of in conscience, ^ the
truth of God; Ergo, The assumption is proved, because what is Gods Word and
truth, of that we are to be assured of i^ conscience, as Col. 2. 7. Being knit
together in love unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, and
Heb. 6. 11. should keep the full assurance of hope to the end, Col. 2. 2, 3.
Ephesians. 4. 14.

3. If the people of the jews did swear a covenant with God, to keep the
words of the covenant, to do them, Deuteronomy. 29. 9. 10, 11. To seek the Lord God
of Israel with all their heart, and with all their soul, 2 Chronicles. 15. 12. and
if they entered into a curse, and an oath, to walk in the Lords law which was
given by Moses the servant of God, to observe and do all the Commandments of
the Lord, and subscribed and sealed the covenant, with their hands, Nehem. 10.
1. v. 29. Then is it lawful for a Church to swear, and by oath subscribe an
Orthodox confession. But the former is true, as the places alleged clear;
Ergo, so is the latter. That which only may be doubted of, is the connection of
the major proposition, because Israel did swear to nothing but to Moses
written Law, which in matter and form was Gods express written word; but it
will not follow, that we may swear a plat-forme of Divine truth framed and
penned by men; but the connection notwithstanding of this remains sure,
because Israel did swear the Lords covenant, according to the true meaning and
intent of the Holy Ghost, as it is Gods Word, and we also swear a National
covenant, not as it is man's word, or because the Church or Doctors, at the
Churches direction, have set it down in such and such words, such an order or
method, but because it is Gods Word, so that we swear to the sense, and
meaning of the platform of confession, as to the Word of God; now the Word of
God, and sense and meaning of the Word is all one; Gods Law and the true
meaning of the Law are not two different things. When a Jew swears to the
doctrine and covenant of God in the Old Testament, in a Jewish meaning, he
swears not to the Word of God, because the Word of God unsoundly expounded is
not the Word of God; and though the Sadducees and Pharisees swear the five
books of Moses, and the very covenant which Asah and the Kingdom of Iud^h did
swear 2 Chronicles. 15. yet do they not swear the covenant of God, and that same
which Gods people did swear 2 Chronicles. 15. Or if any professing they worship
idols should swear that covenant, alleging the covenant does not forbid idols
to be memorials and objects by which absolute adoration is given to God, we
would not think that they had sworn the covenant of God, but only words of
God falsely expounded, yea and made to be not Gods Word, but a plain lying
invention. Therefore it is all one whether a Church swear a confession, in
express words of Scripture; or a covenant in other words expounding the
Scriptures true meaning and sense according to the language and proper idiom of
the Nation and Church; for we swear not words or a platform as it is such,
but the matter, sense, and meaning of the Scriptures of God set down in that
platform; and it is certain, in Nehemiahs time there was some platform,
either the writings of Moses, or some sound exposition thereof; else I see not
how they could seal it, Nehem. 9. 38. And because of all this, we make a sure
covenant, and write it, and our Princes, Levites and Priests seal unto it. Now
that which was written could not but be a platform either in Scripture only,
according to the meaning of the exacters of the oath, or some interpretation;
else every man writ his own covenant and sealed it, which is not like, for
they all jointly swear this covenant; and the reason of this written, sworn,
and sealed covenant, being moral, as is clear, because of the apostasy of
the whole Church, and judgments upon them, for their apostasy, v. 38. And
because of all this, we make, and write a sure covenant, says the Text (...)
and in toto hoe (vertit Arias Mont.
Arias montanus) nos excidentes fidelitatem Hebraei.
Iudaei excudentes faedus fidele, Iunius annot.
Iunius, pro toto hoc pepigimus constitutionem; now sins, backslidings, and
judgments may be and often are in all the Christian Churches. 2. To swear to
the true religion, the defense and maintenance thereof is a lawful oath; as to
swear to any thing that is lawful, and to lay a new band on our souls to
perform holy duties, where we fear a breach, and find by experience there
has been a breach, is also a duty of moral and perpetual equity; therefore
such a sworn covenant is lawful: I say not from this place, that it is
necessary, that all subscribe with their hands a covenant, because I think
only the Princes, Levites, Priests and heads of families did subscribe the
covenant, Nehem. 9. 38. but Nehem. 10. 28, 29. The whole people, all who had
separated themselves from the Lands sin, and their strange wives, even their
wives, their sons, their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having
understanding. V. 29. They clave to their brethren, their Nobles and entered
into a curse, and into an oath to walk in Gods Law. If it be replied, that
there was in Israel no written covenant drawn up by a man, and put in a man's
style, language, method, and frame, they did swear to keep Moses his Law. I
answer, when we swear a covenant, our faith does not rely upon words,
characters, style of language, or humane method, or any humane respects, but
upon the truth of God, in that platform; and suppose we should swear and
subscribe the Old and New Testament translated into our vulgar Language; we do
not swear to the translation, characters, and humane expression; but to the
matter contained in the translation; and that because Jehovah our Lord has
spoken it in his Word. And if this be a good argument why we cannot swear a
platform, then should none swear a covenant at all, or make any holy vow, but
those who understand the original Languages in Hebrew and Greek; and yet the
characters and imprinting is humane even in the original, so all religious
covenants and oaths should be unlawful.

4. Argum. What a Church or person is to suffer for, or to believe, and obliged
to render account of to every one that asks account of us, that we may
swear, and seal with our hands, because what we are to suffer death for, and
the loss of temporal life, for which we owe a reckoning to God by virtue of
the ^ixt Commandment, that is a matter of truth which we profess before God
and men, and our dying for the truth, is a sort of real oath, that we are
before God professing that truth, is to be preferred to our life.

But we are to suffer (if God call us) even death for the true Religion, Revel.
2. 13. Act. 7. 57, 58. Luke 21. 15 16. Phil. 1. 20, 21. and the truth; and we
are obliged to believe, and to give account thereof before all men, and a
reason of our faith and hope, 1 Pet: ^, 15. Ergo, we may swear it.

Argum. 5. If an oath to the true Religion, and form of wholesome Doctine, be
a special remedy against back^iding, and a mean to keep off false and
heretical doctrine; then is such an oath lawful: but the former is true* Ergo;
The Proposition is clear; Gods people say, Nehem. 9. 38. Because of all this;
that is, because they had done wickedly, and were tempted still to do more,
therefore they write and seal a Covenant; and if false teachers teach,
Circumcision must be if we^ would be saved, then the Church may, according to
Acts 15. condem^e that false doctrine by the Word of God, and set down Canons
which the Churches are to observe; and what they are to observe as warranted by
Gods Word, lays on bands upon the Conscience, and what lays on such a
band, that we may bind our selves, by oath, to perform, it being a special
remedy lawful against backsliding from the truth.

6. Arg. Our brethren have their grounds and reasons against the swearing of
confession common to them, with the Arminians and Socinians, and their
Arguments are all one; for Remonst. in scrip. Synodicis page 81.
Arminians censure the Belgic confession and the Pala^ines Catechism, and
propound thirteen questions against it, as the third question is, An
quaecunque dogmata in confessione and Cat^chisme tractantur talia sunt, ut
cuilibet Christiano ad salutem creditu necessaria sint. And their seventh
question is, If such confessions may be called secundaria fidei norma; a
secundary rule of faith: also all Confessions, say they, Remonst. in presat. ^
Declarat. suam Confessiones co fine editae, non ut authors earum, testatum
facerent quid sit credendum sed quid ipsi crederent.
declare That Confessions serve not to teach what we ought to believe, but what
the Authors of these Confessions did believe. Hence they reject all the
determinations of the Orthodox Councels, condemning the heresies of Arrius,
Eutiches, Macedonius, Apollinaris, Sabelli^, Samosate^us, Pelagius, and all the
Oxthodox Confessions of the reformed Churches. Secondly, also upon these
grounds they allege in their Apology Apolog. Rem^str. fol. 6.
There be few things to be believes, that every sect may be the true Church, so
they believe some few Articles not controverted amongst Christians, such as
these, The there is a God, and that the Word of God is true, etc. Thirdly, they
will not condemn the Macedonians, Arrians, Anti-trinitar^^, Pelagians, or
others, of fundamental herefies. Fourthly, that one Church of Christians may
be made up of Papists, Protestants, Anabaptists, Macedonians, Sabellians, etc.
and all sects so they lead a good life, according to the few Articles
necessary to salvation, may be saved, and all may be saved of any sect or
Religion. Fifthly, that to swear Declarations, Confessions, Canons of Orthodox
Councels, is to take away the liberty of prophesying and growing in the
knowledge of the Word of God, and the praying for grace and light of the holy
Spirit for the right meaning of Gods Word. Sixthly, that Athanasius spoke
amiss, when he said of the Creed, that it was to be believed of every one who
is to be saved, (...), and the same is the doctrine of the Socinians, who do
in all these oppose all Confessions of Faith, and all Orthodox Decisions,
Canons, and determinations of Sinods. So Socinus Respon. and Resp. and Volani
page 2 22.
Socinus rejects all Synods, all Confessions and Decisions even of the Church
universal. So Smalcius refut. lib. de error. Arr. au. 1. c. 1. f. 6.
Smalcius cal^eth it a rejecting of the Word of God. And Nicolaid. in resut.
tract. de Ecclesia c. 9. page 75.
Theol. Nico^aides says, That it is enough to know things absolutely necessary
for salvation; and that the Churches determination cannot remove errors and
heresies.

Our brethens first Argument against a National Covenant ^, Quest. ^8^
If the doctrine contained in your platform of Confession ^warve from the
Scriptures, then the imposing thereof is so far unlawful; if the doctrine be
according to Scripture, the platform is ^eedlesse, the Scripture being
sufficient.

Ans. 1. This is the argument of Arminians, Episcopius says, Episc^pius disp.
32. these. 2.
and expressly Smalcius loc. cit.
Smalcius, Qui vnlt sensum scripturae ab il^s (confessionibus) peti, tacit
deserit scripta Apostolica, and traditiones humanas commendat. And therefore
such decisions are ^ay the Remonst. Apol. f. 29.
Remonstrantes) Pestes Ecclesiarum and regni An^christi, idest, tyrannidis
fulcra and tibicines. Secondly, this Ar^ument may be as well propounded against
the preaching of the Word, all printed Sermons, Commentaries, and
interpretation of Scripture, as against a Confession: For if the doctrine in
Ser^ons be not agreeable to Scripture, then in so far as Ministers commend
and command it to their hearers, it is unlawf^ll; if it be agreeable to the
Scripture, it is needless, the Scriptures (says the Socinian Smalcius) are
sufficient.

Our brethren answer, Preaching is an ordinance of God, but a ^atforme of
confession is not an ordinance of God.

Answ. A platform, as it is conceived, in such a style, me^hod, and
characters, and words, is a humane ordinance, Tali ^rie and ordine, and so is
preaching; but we swear to no plat^orme in that consideration; but a platform
according to the truth contained in it, in which sense only it is sworn unto,
is the Word of God, as are systemes of Divinity, ^ermons printed and Preached,
and so though preaching be an Ordinanced God, as it is, Romans 10. 14. yet
according to the words, expression, dialect method, or doctrine, it is an
humane ordinance; and so the Argument is against preaching as against our
platform.

Our Brethrens second Argument is* The Platform abridgeth Christian liberty,
to try all things, and so though it be some means of unity, yet it is a
dangerous hinderance of some verity, binding men to rest upon their former
apprehensions, and knowledge, without libery to better their judgments.

Ans. 1. This in style of language and truth of words is the very argument of
Arminian^. So in their Remonstrant. apol. Hoc itaque fundamento se^el (...)
j^cto, semper in Ecclesia Christi sarta tecta man^^it libertas ((...) ^andi)
qua sine periculo in formulas islas (^d est fidei co^fessiones) inquirere,
iisque sine periculo contradicere licebit.
Preface, and in their Apol. Remonst. s 7. Theologiae ipsius any ma suffocatur
atque eliditur, ubi decisiones sunt, quibus constanter sirmiterque haerendum
esl.
Apology it self they say. All liberty of prophecing and disputing against the
Orthodox faith is taken away, if men be tied and obliged to decisions and
confessions of Churches, and Synods. Yea to make an end of controversies (says
Episcop. disp. 32. These. 11. li^i ^m sinem facere circa Religionis capita (per
confessones and cavones synodicos) aliter quam persuadendo, est tyrannidem
invehere in Ecclesiam, l. C. Et libertiu^ conscientiarum si non omnino toll^re,
saltem vehementer astringere and ligare.
Episcopius) otherwise then by persuading, is to bring a tyranny into the
Church of Jesus Christ, and wonderfully to bind, if not to take away liberty of
consciences; So in their Apology they say, confessions and decisions of Synods
imposed by Oath, and to be firmly believed ar^ contrary to the prayers of
Saints, where they pray, that God would teach them his starutes, and reveal
his Law and Testimonies ^^ them, and open their Eyes to behold the wonders of
Gods Law. But the truth is, though these of Berea did well to try Paul's
Doctrine, if it was consonant to the Scriptures, or not. Yet Paul's Doctrine was
the determination apostolic of Gods Spirit, to the which they were firmly to
adhere, and their judgments are to be bettered, in graduali revelatione
creditorum, ^^^ revelatione plurium credendorum, in clear revelation of things
revealed. For so the children of God are to grow in grace, and in the knowledge
of our Lord and Savior, 2 Pet. 3. 14. After Christ is once revealed: but not
in believing in a new Christ, or in believing of points contrary to the
confession of faith.

The Argument presupposes the Doctrine of the Arminians, that there be a
number of points in our confession, of which we have no certainty of faith,
that they are Gods truth, but are things controverted, and, being not
fundamental points, may be holden, or we may forsake them, as false, after
better information. Which indeed makes our faith of Gods Word, ^o full
persuasion, but as the learned professors of Leyden Censure declar* profess,
Leyd. in praefa.

Fides ^orari^, vel menstrua stc erit.


say, a faith of an hour, or a month, or a year, which we may ^ast away, the
next year. And this is to deny all confessions and points of truth, with
pretense that the Spirit has revealed new truth: but how are these new
revealed truths (the Revelation whereof we obtain by prayer) rather works of
the spirit of truth; then the former points which we retract? No man by this
can be rooted and built in the faith, of any thing, except in the faith of
things simply fundamental. By which means all points at least many of them
betwixt us and Papists, Arminia^, Macedonians, Sabellians, Arrians,
Anabap^tiste, are matters reconcilable; and either side may be holden, without
hazard of salvation. Neither is this definition of confessions any tyranny.
Because confessions are to be believed, in so far, as they are agreeable to Gods
Word, and lay upon us an obligation secondary only, yet are they not so loose,
as that we may leap from points of faith, and make the doctrine of faith arena
gladiatoria a fencing field for Gamesters and Fencers. The material object of
our faith, and the secondary ground and foundation thereof, may be very well,
and is, Gods Word; primary is preaching, confessions, Creeds, Symbols, which
are not serie and ordine Scripturae: and yet have we certainty of Divine faith
in these things, because the formal object is, because God so says in hi^
Scripture, and we believe these with certainty of Divine Faith, under this
reduplication, because the Lord has spoken these quoad sensum, in true
meaning, though not in illa scrie and ordine; But more of this hereafter.

CHAP. 6. SECT. 6.
Touching Officers and their election.
OUr Author labors to prove that Pastors and Doctors are different Officers,
which we will not much improves, but if the meaning be, that they are
inconsistent, in one man person, we are against him. 1. Because the Apostles
in their own persons, and in feeding the flock, 2 Timothy 3. does both under the
name of Overseers and Bishops, and exercised both, as they could, according as
they did find the auditory. 2. Because the formal objects the informing of
the judgment, and exhorting are not so different, as that they should be
imcompatible, for if God give them gifts both for the Doctors Chair, and the
pastors Pulpit, as he often does, what should hinder but the Church may call
one and the same man, to both the Pastor and the Doctors Chair, as he is able
to, overtake both.

Author. 1. Reas. 1 Cor. 12. 8. To one is given a word of wisdom^ (for
direction of practice,) to another a word of knowledge (for direction of
judgment.) Ans. This proves they be different gifts and Offices, yet not that
they are incompatible in one person, as one may have both gifts given unto him,
as is clear by experience.

2 Reas. Author ib. He speaks of diverse members of the Church, as of
diverse members of the natural body, v. 4. 5. All the members have not one
Office, it is the action of the Tongue to speak, not to see. Ans. The
comparison holds not in all. The eye cannot hear, the ear cannot see, yet
the pastor may both see as pastor, and hear and delate to the Church, as the
Churches ear, the manners of the scandalous.

3. Reas. Author, If the Apostle speak of several exercises of several
gifts, but both coincident to the same person or Church office; why then does
he command the Teacher to wait on teaching, and the Exhorter upon exhorting?
One who has a gift of giveing Alms, and showing mercy, is not commanded to
wait upon Alms giving, unless it be his office, as well as his gift. Ans. It
is not fit that the Doctor should attend the pastoral duties, except he be a
pastor also, and have both gift and office, but having gifts for both, he may
attend both, as the Church calls him to both.

Author. Teaching and exhorting flow from several gifts, and they are seldom
found in one in eminency. Ans. Then where they are found in one in eminency (as
sometimes they are) either has God given a Talent, for no use, which is
against the Wisdom of Gods dispensation, or then he who has gifts for both,
may discharge both, as he may and can through time and strength of body. But
we contend not with our brethren in this, seeing they confess, he that is
gifted for both, may attend both.

CHAP. 7. SECT. 7.
Of Ruling Elders.
WE subscribe willingly to what our Author says, for the Ruling Elders.
office of ruling Elders in the Church.

For Paul, Romans 12. 8. from four principal acts requisite in Christ's house
and body, v. 6, 7, 8. Teaching, Exhorting, Giveing of Alms, R^ling, makes
four ordinary officers, Teachers, Pastors, Deacons and Elders.

Opposite to the office of ruling Elders, object, that by Rulers may be
understood, Governors of Families. Ans. Families as they are such, are not
Churches, but parts of the Church, and clear it is that the Apostle Speaks
of Christ's Body, the Church in that place. 5. As we have many members in one
body, etc.

They Object that Paul speaks of several gifts, not of public Offices in
the Church, for he speaks of all the power and actions, of all the members of
the Body of Christ; now the offices alone are not the body, but all the
multitude of believers.

Ans. This cannot well be answered, by these, who make all the believers
governors, and a generation of Kings and Teachers: because it is expressly
said, v. 4. all members have not the same office. Ergo, they are not all to
attend ruling, and to rule with diligence. 2. (...) is false that he speaks
not of Officers, and public Officer. He who speaks of reigning does indeed
speak of a King, as he who speaks of exhorting which is the specific act of
a pastor, speaks of a pastor. The place, ^1 Cor. 12. 28. 29. Is clear for
Ruling Elders: but some say, that governors are but arhiters, which Paul
bids the Corinthians set up in the Church for decyding of civil
controversies. 2. Cor. 6. that they go not to Law one against another* before
heathen Judges.

Ans. Paul commands to obey Judges, but never to set up a new order of Judges
in their room. 2. These arbitees we^^ not governors to command, but rather
faithful Christians to counsel, and remove controversies, or Christian
reconcilers to hinder them to go to the Law, one with another before infi^^^
judges. 3. The Apostle is speaking here of such Officers as Christ has set in
the Church, as the Church and Kingdom of Christ, but these civil arbitrators,
are no Church Officers, ^^ Tim. 5. 17. The Elders who rule well are worthy of
double honor, etc. This place speaks clear for ruling Elders.

The adversaries say: here are meant Deacons to whom are allowed stipends, for
either here, or elsewhere wages are allowed for Deacons.

Answ. 1. Paul would not speak so honorably of Deacons, as to allow them the
worth of a double honorable reward. Yea Gods Word purteth the Deacons out of
the roll of Rulers and governors in Gods house, as having nothing to do by
Acts 6. v. 2.
their office to labor in the Word and Prayer, but are in Gods wisdom set
lower to attend Tables, nor does the word call them Elders, or (...) in
relation to the Church but only in relation to their own family and house. 2 Timothy 3. 12. their office is an office of mere service of Tables. 2. He is a
laboring Elder worthy of wages, that the Apostle speaks of here, as, v. 18.
The Deaconship being to receive the mercy and charity, which is alms, and not
debt, cannot be such an office as takes up the whole man, so as he must live
upon the Churches charges. 3. Bilson Bilson. de gube^ not. Eccles. c. 0. p. 179.
a man partial in this cause, against the mind of all the ancients (says
Didoclavius Didoclav. in altar Damascen. p. 918.
gives this interpetation. But it is seconded with no warrant of Gods Word,
for Governors and Deacons are made two species of officers, Romans 12. 8. (...)
he who rules with diligence, and he who has mercy with cheerfulness. And
two opposite species are not predicated, the one of the other. And if well
governing, Romans 12. be ^ell teaching and diligent exhorting, all are confounded
in that Text, where the Apostle marshalleth the officers and their several
exercises so accurately.

Nor can he mean here Bishops so old that they are not now ab^e to labor in
the word and doctrine, for then pasto^s for their age and inhability to preach,
should because of their age and infirmity, deserve less honor and reward,
then the younger who are able to labor in the word and doctrine. This is cross
to the sift Commandment, which adds honor and double honor to age, and
gray hairs, being found in the way of righteousness. 2. Against Justice, that
because years and pains in Gods Service, has made them aged, for that they
are to have less honor and reward: whereas they deserve the double; rather
then that the younger should be preferred to them.

Nor. 3. Can the Apostles meaning be, that these who rule well that lead an
exemplarily holy life, are worthy of honor, especially painful preachers.
Because 1. A person is never called a labourer, and worthy of hire, as the Ox
that treads out the Corn, because of holiness of life, especially the
Church ^s not to give stipend to a pastor, for his holy life. 2. Their life
should be exemplarily holy, who did not labor in the word and doctrine, that
is, we have a pastor passing holy in his life, but he cannot preach, or keeps
an ill conscience in his calling, because he is lazy and a loyterer in
preaching. 3. What Word of God, or dialect in the word expresses a holy life,
by well gover^ing, for a holy life is the sanctity of man's conversation be he a
private, or a public man. But to govern well, is the paraphase of a good
Governor and officer, in the Greek tongue or any other Language.

Nor. 4. Can the Apostle understand by laborers in the Word and Doctrine ( as
Bilson Bilson. de gubern. p. 183.
says) such as w^nt thorough the Earth, and made j^urnies, as Apostles and
Evangelists did, to plant visit and confirm Churches, and by these who govern
well, such as labor indeed in the Word and Doctrine, but are fixed to a
certain place.

I answer, Then the well ruling Elders are not laborers in the Word and
Doctrine; for out of Question one of the species of Elders here mentioned, do
not labor in Word and Doctrine at all. But by this interpretation, both labor
in the Word and Doctrine; but the one in a fixed place, the other by Apostolic
journeys through the World. And the object of one of these Offices, to wit, the
Word and Doctrine differenceth the one from the other, whose object must be not
the Word and Doctrine; for word and Doctrine need not to be governed, but the
Church, and persons in Church State need to be governed.

2. There is no warrant of the Word, that to labor in the Word is proper to
the Apostles and Evangelists, journeying through the World, seeing (as
Didoclavius altar. Damascen. p. 921.
Didoclavius observeth^) the same word (...), is ascribed to those who in a
fixed place labor, 1 These. 5. 12, 13. Who labor amongst you. Yea, and it is
taken for any travel of mind or body in the Word. 3. He is not here to deny,
nor can the Apostle deny, but traveling Apostles and Evangelists did govern
well, especially in planting Elders in every Church, and governing the planted
Churches, but he cannot speak of traveling to the wearying of the body: when
the object of traveling is expressed, to wit, ( in Word and Doctrine) which
object is not given to the well ruling Elder.

A more special consideration of Ruling Elders, Deacons, and Widows. 1 Timothy
5. 17.
AFter the Apostle has spoken of Widows, and their service in the Church, he
passes from them to speak of excellenter Officers, to wit, of the ruling and
the teaching Elders. There be many interpretations (say the opposers of ruling
Elders) given upon this place; and therefore it is hard to build a new
Church Officer on a Text so obnoxious to various debates.

Answ. This would be concludent in part, if the nature of the Text were the
native seminary of these various interpretations; but most of these debates
arise from the wits of parties interressed in the question, such as Papists,
Prelates, or deniers of all Church Government. But I provoke to all the
Fathers, especially to Chrysostom and the Greek Fathers, who have expounded
the place, if any ever did deny but this place holds forth two sorts of
Elders, though I grant they vary concerning the Elders, which labor not in the
word and doctrine. And this interpretation, Elders who rule well are worthy of
double honor, especially (...), id est, (...), because, or upon this
consideration and respect, that they labor in the word and doctrine, was never
known till of late. But we desire these five circumstances in the Text to be
considered; for we build not our interpretation on any one, or two, or three of
them, but we desire they may be looked on copulatively; for I confess a
participle being attributum, or quasi attributum, though doubled or multiplied,
does not multiply subjects, because two, six, an hundred attributes may agree
to one subject; and the Scripture and Greek language can well bear this. As
Col. 2. 5. I am present with you in the spirit, ((...)) rejoicing and beholding
your order. One Paul only did both rejoice and behold. And 2 Pet. 3. 11. What
manner of persons ought we to be, (...), looking for and hastening unto the
coming of the day of God. Here is no multiplying of persons. 2. I confess
also, that two articles (...), or (...), do not multiply subjects, or make a
distinction of diverse sorts of persons. As Revel. 2. 1. These things says he,
(...), it is one and the same Jesus who holds the seven Stars in his right
hand, and who walks in the midst of the Golden Candlestickes. But we desire
that the confluence of these five may be looked unto: as 1. there is a genus, a
general attribute, (...), Elders; and this agrees both to well ruling Elders,
and to those which labor in the word and doctrine. 2. There be here two
participles, (...). 3. Two articles, (...). 4. Two species, two kinds of
Elders, under the general attribute of (...). As the one species or kind is,
(...), such Elders as rule well; and the other kind of Elders be (...), such
as labor in the Word, as Pastors; and in Doctrine, as Doct^rs. And fifthly,
which is most considerable, here be two Participles, two Articles, two special
Elders divided and separated (...), by the discretive particle (...). And I
provoke to all the Authors of the Greek Language, Demost^enes, Isocrates,
Aristophanes, Pindarus, etc. to the Septuagint in the Old Testament, to the
whole New Testament for one parallel place, where one and the same subject or
kind is so expressed, except you play foul play to the Text: also that (...)
is a particle of discretion and multiplication of diverse kinds, to me is
clear, ^^ Ti^us 1. verse. 11. There ^^ many unruly and vain talkers, (...),
especially those of the Circumcision, if (...) the particle ( especially) do
not divide two sorts of vain talkers, some vain talkers of the Circumcision,
and some vain talkers not of the Circumcision; then must this particle
conjoyne them, and make no vain talkers, save only these of the circumcision;
and Paul shall say then, there be many unruly and vain talking persons of the
circumcision, but especially those of the circumcision; which nonsense is not
to be ascribed to the spirit of God, so 1 Timothy 4. 10. Who is the Savior of all
men, especially of believers, (...). It (...) do not infer that Christ is
the Savior of some who believe, and in a general sense a Savior of some who
believe not; then must Christ bestow one and the same salvation on all men, and
also on believers, which neither Arminians nor common sense can affirm, 1 Timothy
5. 8. He who provideth not for his olvne, (...), especially for those of his
own house. If it be not required that a believer provide for two sorts, to wit,
these of his family, children and servants in an especial manner; and for
friends also, who are not of his own house; then will Paul have the believer
to provide for none but for his own house, which does belie the Text, which
says, he must provide for all his own, and in a special manner for his own
house; now if he be to provide for them, for this respect because they are of
his own house, then by this Text he is not to provide for his brethren,
sisters, and blood-friends, because they are not of his own as members of his
house, or his own, Gal. 6. 10. Let us do good to all, but especially, (...)
to those who are of the household of faith. Ergo, we are to do good to some who
are of the household of faith, and to some who are not of the household of faith;
except you say the Text does bear only, that we are to do good to none, save
only to those who are of the household of faith, which is nonsense, Phil. 4.
22. All the Saints, (...), salute you, (...) especially those of Caesar's house.
Hence two sorts of Saints saluted the Philippians, some Saints of Caesar's
house, and some not of Caesar's house; this you must say if you will not have
the Text to bear either that no Saints did salute the Philippians, save only
the Saints of Caesar's house, contrary to sense; for the Text says, All the
Saints (here with me at Rome) salute you. Otherways you must say, that the
reason and motive why the Saints saluted the Philippians, was because they were
Saints of Caesar's house, as you say, the special cause and respect why the
well ruling Pastor is worthy of double honor, is because he labors in the
Word and 'Doctrine; for so you expound it. Now this is two ways false, for 1.
this can be no respect and cause why all the Saints saluted the Philippians,
except all the Saints which did salute them were only the Saints of Caesar's
house; and so both the argument should be false, and the conclusion false, for
they were not all of Caesar's house who saluted the Philippians. Nor 2. was this
the reason why they did salute them; for the Saints did salute the Philippians
upon this ground of Christian relation, because they were Saints, and loved one
another in Christ, and not upon this civil and common consideration, because
they were Caesar's Domestickes, and Courtiers with the Emperor. So a Tim. 4.
13. Bring with thee the cloak which I left at Troas, and books, but (...)
especially the parchments. And thus do also the Hebrews speak, Prove. 11. 31.
Retribution shall be made to the just, far more to the wicked. Here be clearly
two sorts of retributions, and two kinds of persons which are recompensed. And
Prove. 17. 7. The (...) Prove. 21. v. 27.
li^s of honor are not seemly for a fool, much less is falsity to a
liberal man, or to a Prince. I know these examples do not every way come home
to our point, but they prove that (...) is to the Hebrews a note of discretion;
as also, ^ Psalm. 31. v. 11. is even as (...) is to the Greeks. It is true,
where a genus and a species, a general and a special under that are set
down, (for as much as genus and species non faci^nt numerism) there is no need
that (...) or the particle ( especially) should be as a note of dicretion or
multiplication. As if ( I should say, a Judge is to be honored, but especially
judging righteously,) I should not infer that there are two sorts of Judges;
but the case is not so here, because two species are expressly set down, to
wit, those who rule well, and those who labor in the Word and Doctrine. And if
I should say, ( a Judge judging righteously for all, is worthy of much honor,
especially he that judges righteously for the Widow and the Orphane) I should
in this hold forth, either two sorts of righteous Judges, or then I should say
no other, but he who judges righteously for a^^, is to be honored, especially
he who judges righteously for these, and these comprehended under this ( all.)
Thirdly, I should in that also say that there be two things, though not two
sorts of judges, worthy of much honor, to wit, the office of a Judge, and his
equal and unpartiall judging are both worthy of double honor. But Paul is not
here allowing honor to the office in abstracto, and in a general notion, but
to the officer in specie and in concreto, who does rule well, and labor in the
word and doctrine.

Object. 2. But Paul does here understand by him that rules well, the civil
Magistrate.
Answ. When Paul is here speaking of the Economy of Gods house, it is not
consonant to the Text, that he would instruct Timothy of the wages due to the
Emperor Nero, and yoice the Emperor in one verse, with the Pastor and the
Doctor laboring in the word and doctrine, and prove from the Law that the
mouth of Nero should not be muzled. Nor does the Word give this word (...), to
Magistrates, but some higher styles, calling them (...), Tit. 3. 1.
Principalities and powers, Romans 13. 1. Secondly, this Text would prove that
double wages were due to Paul above Nero the Emperor, and that Pastors are
more to be honored then Emperors and Kings. Thirdly, the Text speaks clearly
of two parallel species of Bilson de Guber. c. 10. p. 179. Didoclavius Altar.
Damascen. p. 920.
Elders in the Church, but the Magistrate is no parallel line with preaching
Elders.

Object. 3. By those who rule well, are understood Deacons, who take care of
the poor.
Answ. Didoclavius observes, that Deacons are never called Rulers, but
distinguished from them, Romans 12. 8. Secondly, the well ruling here takes up
the half of the Pastors Office, and all that belongs thereunto, except
laboring in the word and doctrine; as to receive accusations against an Elder,
to judge and govern with the Pastor, to visit the sick, to exhort and rebuse
in a judicial way; but to serve Tables, and to take care of the poor only,
is the least and most inferior part of well-governing of Gods house, and is
but a care for their bodies: Whereas to rule well, is an Ecclesiastical
Magistracy, to go in and out before Gods people, to watch for their souls, as
those which must give an account, Hebr. 13. 17. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. The Deacon
cares for the body only, and the Deacon, that Bilson and others would have
with him, is neither in this place, nor in all Gods Word, as we shall hear.

O^. 4. By these who rule well, are understord, Bishops, who for age, cannot
preach yet rule well.
Ans. Surely these who have labored in the Word and Doctrine, and spent their
strength in painful preaching, and now, in old age, rule well, cannot in
reason be thought worthy of less honor and wages, then preaching Elders, but
above them, as emeriti milites are not to be degraded: and if they have never
labored in the Word and Doctrine, they being Bishops, by office, must be dumb
dogs, and worthy of no honor at all. 2. They cannot rule well, as Pastors, and
yet be dumb, and not labor in the word. 3. The Text speaks not of Elders,
aetate, by age, but of Elders, Officio, by office, who labor, as workmen in a
vineyard, v. 18.

Ob. 5. By ruling well he means a holy life, so as he means not only that
Pastors should live holily, but also preach painfully.
Answ. Didoclavius answers, that then all that live holily, should have
stipend, as workmen; and certainly if Paul had spoken nothing of these who
labor in the word and Doctrine, yet the Text does hold forth that these who
rule well, and do not labor in the Word and Doctrine are worthy of honor;
for the comparative here, or superlative degree, does well infer the positive
degree. But 1. Ministers shall be worthy of honor, though they preach not. 2.
The arguments which I brought, to prove, and that undeniably, that there be two
sorts of Elders, in the Text fight against this sense, which infers that
their is but one sort of preaching Elders here, to whom double honor is due,
for two respects, to wit, holiness of life, and painful preaching. 3.
Holiness of life in all Gods Word, is never expressed by well governing, which
is a work of a public Church Officer, as is clear. Romans 12. 8. 1 Thessalonians. 5.
12. 13. holiness of life is common to all private Christians, yea and to
women, who cannot rule, nor rule well.

Ob. 6. The Rulers here ought to have wages, as workmen, but your Elders have
no wages. Ergo, your Elders are not in this Text.
Answ. That is not concluded, which is in question; for the assumption should
be, but your Elders ought to have no wages, and are worthy of no honor,) and
the assumption is only de facto, (they have none) 2. This argument might prove
that a noble man, called to be a Minister, if he should take no stipend, were
not a lawful Minister; and Paul then was no lawful pastor, at Corinth,
because he refused stipend; but stipend is due to both Pastor and Elder, and
in the case of scandal, it is due to neither of them, hic and hunc.

Ob. 7. If there be two sorts of Elders here, there must be two sorts of
Bishops, for Presbyter and Bishop are synonyma, and one and the same, as is
clear, Tit. 1. 6, 7. Acts 20. 17. They are called Elders, and v. 28. Bishops.
But we cannot admit of two sorts of Bishops: some to rule, and some to preach,
that were Antichristian.
Answ. Though there be two sort of Elders here, it does not follow that there
be two sorts of Bishops: and it is not proved because Elder and Bishop are not
proved to be synonyma from the alleged places, genus and species, as a living
Creature and a man are not synonyma, but have different definitions. Gladius
and ensis have the same definitions, as a man and a discoursing creature are
synonyma. An Elder is a general, and a Bishop a sort of Elder, and an Apostle
is an Elder, and so Peter terms himself, 1 Pet. 5. 1. an Elder: ^u^ Divines
say that a preaching Elder, and a Bishop are synonyma, one and the same, and
synonyma non faciunt mum^rum, as Gladius and Ensis: but they never taught that
an Elder in general and a Bishop, are synonyma and the same, nor do the
places, Acts 20. Tit. 1. prove it; for if they be all preaching Elders, to whom
Paul preached at Ephesus, Acts 20. as the Text seems to make them, Acts 20,
28, 29. then the Elders that Paul called for v. 17. are preaching Elders, and
the same with Bishops v. 28. and Tit. 1. Paul wills Titus to ordain Elders,
that is, both preaching and ruling Elders, and there he gives an instance in
preaching Elders, or Bishops, and shows what sort of men Bishops should be.
2. If there be two sorts of Elders, 1 Timothy 5. 17. then should there be two
sorts of Bishops; I distinguish the proposition, then are there two sorts of
preaching Bishops, I deny the proposition in this sense, but if the meaning be,
there be two species of Bishops, or Overseers, one ruling Overseers, and
another preaching Bishops, we shall not contend for the word, if we agree upon
the thing, though I much doubt, if the ruling Elder in the Scripture, come
under the name of Bishop or (...). 3. This objection falls under the stroke
of the arguments proving that there be two sorts of Elders in this Text, and
how they can be answered, I know not.

Ob. 8. That office is not in Scripture, whose Characters, qualities, and notes
are not specified in Scripture, as the Characters of a Deacon are, 1 Timothy 3.
and of a Bishop ibid. But the Characters, qualites and notes of a ruling Elder
are not in the Scripture, Ergo, etc.
Answ. 1. I deny the major proposition; for then, because the Scripture says
not, an Apostle should be blameles, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober,
and thus and thus, and an Evangelist should be thus and thus, and a prophet
should be thus and thus qualified, therefore Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets,
are not in Scripture. It is true these were but temporal offices, yet it is
enough to take off and break the argument, for these temporary ^ffices, must
be no less warranted, by the word, except they be unlawful, then the offices
that are of perpetual indurance. 2. I distinguish the major proposition, That
office is not in Scripture, whose characters are not in Scripture, neither in
one particular place, expressly and (...), it is not true; for baptism: in no
one place is so expressly set down in Scripture, from all its Characters in
particular, as is the Supper of the Lord, which is described, Mat. 26. Luke 22.
Mark. 14. 1 Cor. 11. in the Elements, sacred actions, prayer, consecration,
words of institution, efficient, form, end, gesture, etc. Yet is baptism for
that not excluded from the class and number of Gods ordinances and seals, or,
that office is not in Scripture whose Characters are not in Scripture, nether
in diverse places of Scripture, nor by good consequence, and lawful analogy
with other its fellow offices, that I yield willingy: but now the assumption is
false: for as baptism by analogy is described in many of its Characters, as
prayer, consecration of the Elements, end etc. when the Supper of the Lord is
described, making a just proportion betwixt baptism and the other Sacrament,
and by other places of Scripture, so is the ruling Elder in his characters
described; when the Bishop his fellow-officer is described. 3. The assumption
also is false; for the ruling Elder is described out of this Text. 1.
negatively, that hence is gathered, by strong consequence, as is said, that he
is an Elder who labors not in the Word and Doctrine. 2. He is described
affirmatively, for an office is sufficiently described, when the specific acts
thereof are set down, as a man is described when we say, he is a Creature
who does discourse, and make use of Reason; so is this Elder described, when
we say it is his office to rule well, 1 Timothy 5. 17. he is a (...), and a
government which Christ has (...) instituted in the body, 1 Cor. 12. 28. and
he is Romans 12. 4. an Organ and member of Christ's body, whose office it is to
rule, (...) with diligence, Romans 12, 8.

Ob. 9. But it is but a general, that he rule, we have not these wherein the
particulars of his ruling, consist.
Ans. If this be strong, you have not, 1 Timothy 3. the particulars of the
pastoral teaching, but only the generals, a Bishop must be apt to teach. Yet
in other places we have the particulars, a^ instructing, rebuking, confuting,
convincing; so what ever the Scripture says of the preaching Elders ruling,
that same is says of the ruling Elders ruling, seeing the ruling Elder is the
assistant officer to help the preaching Elder, and both of them with the Doctor
are to rule the House of God.

Ob. 10. But if ruling be the specific and essential note of the ruling
Elder, he cannot be a special officer different from the preaching Elder, for
what is essential to one species cannot agree to another, and what
constituteth one species, does not agree to another.
Answ. This connection may well be denied, and it is said well by one; The
ruling Elder solum regit, does only govern, sed non solus regit, but he does
not govern his alone, but with the Pastor and Doctor. From these things I infer
that as this is not a good consequence, Mat. 26. Luke 22. Mark. 14. the Spirit
of God does set down the Lords Supper in all its materials, and passes over
Baptism in silence, and goes to another subject; Ergo, Baptism is not the
other Sacrament of the New Testament so neither is this a good consequence, (
Paul, 1 Timothy 3. Discribeth the Bishop, and over skippeth the ruling Elder,
passing to the Deacon; Ergo, the ruling Elder is not an Ordinance of God) for
while he describes the Bishop, he teaches what an one, both the Doctor, and
ruling Elder should be, by clear analogy, and it had been superfluous for the
Holy Ghost to say more, then he does. And by this we may answer to what is
tenthly objected, The ruling Elder is omitted in Christ's roll, Ephesians. 4. 11.
Ergo, there is no such officer. Answ. It follows in no sort negatively, from
one particular place of Scripture, Rev. 1. It is said only God has made us
Kings and Priests unto God; Ergo, he has not made us Prophets also, the
contrary is, Esai. 54. 13. Ioh. 6. 45. so because, It is life eternal to know
the Father, and the Son, Joh. 17. Socinians collect; Erge, the holy spirit is
not God, because no mention is made of him, in this place. 2. In this place
Paul ennumerateth offices necessary rather for planting Churches, then for
ruling Churches already constituted and planted: Miracles and Tongues are ad
been esse; Elders and Deacons are not named here, because they are for the
leading on of the Church, and the body already set up in a visible frame, and
therefore reckoned out, Romans 12. 4. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. and consider, I pray you,
how uncertain and lubrick a way it is to pin Gods Spirit, and to fetter him to
any one place in his enumerations, Behold, Romans 12. 8* all the ordinary
officers are expressed, and yet Apostles, Evangelists, Miracles, Tongues are
omitted, all which are ennumerated, 1 Cor. 12 28, 29. yet are specific acts of
Prophets, Teachers omitted, 1 Cor. 12. at lest only spoken of in general
under the notion of hearing, seeing, walking, and Romans 12. they be more
particularly set down. And 1. Tim. 3. Phil. 1. 1. only Bishops and Deacons
are mentioned, and governments, and Elders ruling well ^mitted; and also all
the extraordinary officers are omitted, and yet mentioned, 1 Cor. 12. 18, 29.
and Miracles, Tongues, Deacons, Governments are omitted, Ephesians. 4. 11. and, 1 Timothy 5. 17. Preachers, Rulers, Doctors are expressed, Deacons and extraordinary
officers, Apostles, Evangelists, etc. passed over in silence:

Ob. 11. The Keys are not given to this ruling Elder, Ergo, he is no lawful
officer: the antecedent is proved, the keys of jurisdiction, because they can
operate nothing, but by the Key of knowledge, cannot be given to this new
officer, now the key of knowledge is given only to the preaching Elder.
Ans. All depends upon this false proposition; To these only are the keys of
jurisdiction, and power of binding and loosing given, to whom the keys of
knowledge are given,) for though the one key work nothing without the other,
yet the proposition is not from this made good, for the key of knowledge, and
the power of pastoral preaching is given, uni subjective, non unitati nisi
objective, to one man as to the subject, and to the Church, for her salvation
and good, as for the end and object; and the Pastor being once ordained a
Pastor, may use these Keys, quoad specificationem independently, for he may
preach mercy and wrath, not waiting the Churches suffrages, Et potestas clavium
quoad jurisdictionem data ^st ecclesiae and subjective and objective, and data
est non uni, sed unitati: but the power of the keys, in censures, for binding
and loosing is given to no one mortal man, but to the Church, both as to the
subject, and the object. I mean the Ministerial Church; and not one man
Pastor, Pope, o^ prelate may use the Keys, the Church has them, and can only
validly use them.

Ob. 12. But how is it proved that Ruling Elders are of divine institution?
Ans. God has placed, (...), Ruling Elders in the body, as is said, 1 Cor. 12.
28. and this is, Romans 12. 4. compared with v. 8. an Office that Christ has
appointed, and as these places prove the exhorter or pastor to be of Divine
institution, and the Apostle, Teacher, Prophet, 1 Cor. 12. 28. and the Elder
who labors in the Word and Doctrine, to be an instituted worke-man worthy of
wages, 1 Timothy 5. 17, 18. So must they prove the man who rules well, and with
diligence, to be of divine appointment.

Ob. 13. But the ruling in diligence, Romans 12. 8. and the governments, 1 Cor.
12. 28. are generals, and so cannot constitute a special office, in the body:
for it is against logic, that that which is general, and common to all the
officers, can constitute a species, or a special kind:
Answ. This obliges the opponent, to teach, what is meant by governors,
whether Magistrates, but these be not an office in Christ's Body as is here
said, Romans 12. 4. and 1 Cor. 12. 14, 15. or do they mean masters of families?
but these be parts of heathen societies, as well as of Christian, and a Family
as it is such, is not the Church. 3. Nor can he mean here of Preachers, for
Romans 12. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. the exhorter and the ruler with diligence, the
Teacher, and Prophet, and governments are clearly differenced, as different
organs of the body, Eye, Ear, Hand, Foot, 1 Cor. 12. 14, 15. Romans 12. 4. nor
(4) can they understand Rulers in general: for, a genus, a general does not
exist, or have actual subsistence, but in some determinnate species; as a
living Creature does not subsist but in man, or in some specific nature of
Birds and Beasts: now God is said to place these governments in the body, 1
Cor. 12. 28. even as the Eye, and Ear and Hand are seated in the body, 1 Cor.
12. 16, 17, 18. Now as a general Eye, or an Organ in general is not placed in
the body, but such a determinat Organ, an Eye, an Ear, an Hand, a Foot; so
neither has the wisdom of Christ appointed a governor in general, and left
it to the Churches discretion to specify what this governor shall be, whether
a Prelate, a Pastor, a ruling Elder: but as God has not set Teachers in the
body in general, but he has placed such and such species, Apostles, not
Popes, Evangelists, not Cardinals; so must he have determined such and such
Governors, ruling Elders, rather then a certain Creature named a Diocesan
prelate, an uncouth beast in the holy Scripture.

A very Jesuit, Salmeron, says, by the two Elders he means, Salmeron in 1 Timothy 5. 17. disp. 15. Tom. 15. Ambrosius in 1 Timothy

Chrysostom. hom. 15. Estius, comment. 1 Timothy 5.


1 Timothy 5. 17. ( aperte sermonem esse de presbyteris and Episcopis) of Elders
and Pastors, and with that of Ambrosius, which we all know to be ruling
Elders, who were out of use in the Church, by the negligence, or rather by the
pride of preaching Elders, forte Doctorum d^sidia, aut magis superbia; and we
are not to think, Chrysostom was ignorant of his mother Tongue, and he
finds 1 Timothy 5. 17. two sorts of Elders in this place, and a popish Expositor
Estius, porro manefeste Colligitur ex hac sententia, fuisse, etiam apostolorum
tempore, quosdam in ecclesia presbyteros, qui and been praeessent, and duplici
honor digni essent, nec tamen labotarent in verbo and Doctrina, neque id
hodierni sectarii negant; and all the haeresie that he lays on Calvin, in
this point, is that Calvin makes these laymen; And Estius makes a question
what these Elders were, whether they be the Cardinals, which the pope has, or
the Canonical Elders, which their Bishops use as counselors in grave matters,
or Elders which rule well, and labor not in the Word and Doctrine, such as
were in the Apostles time, or rather such as did help the Bishops in offering
sacrifice, and in administrating the Sacraments; or if they be such as rule the
people, but cannot preach, such as Alipius and Val^rius were in Augustines
time; so Estius knows not what these Elders be, but inclines to make them
elders to the Apostles, in the administration of the Sacraments.

Ob. 14. But Romans 12. 8. the Apostle speaks of diverse gifts, as v. 6. having
then gifts, differing according to the grace, that is given to us, whether
prophecy, let us prophecy, etc. Ergo, the Apostle does not speak of diverse
offices. 2. One and the same man may both teach, and exhort, and therefore
Pastor and Doctor are not here differenced. 3. The Deacons office shall be here
described, by the interjection of the ruling Elder, but the two acts of the
deacon, which is to give with simplicity, and, to show mercy with
cheerfulness, and which is an insolent order, therefore the Apostle does not
here ennumerate diverse offices.
Answ. There is no better consequence in this, to say, he speaks of diverse
gifts; Ergo, he speaks not of diverse offices, then to say, he speaks of
diverse faculties and habilities in the natural body, as of an hability of
seeing, hearing; Ergo, he acknowledges not diverse members with diverse
offices, as the Eye to see, the E^re to hear, yea the contrary is rather a
good consequence; and the Text is clear that he speaks of diverse offices, v.
4. for as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same
office. So we being many, are one body, in Christ, and every one members, one
of another. Yea the Text holds forth these five to us to be distinctly
considered. 1. That the Church is one body organicall, having diverse members.
2. That there be diverse gifts of the spirit in this body, as is clear, Romans
12. v. 3. 4, 5. (3) That there be diverse offices, and places and functions in
this body, which the Apostle excellently divides into two generals according
to the necessities of the members of Christ's body. Now in general this
necessity is two fold, one respecting the soul, and for this, he has
ordained, (...) prophecy, and for the bodily necessity, (...). Ministry and
Service. v. 6. and v. 7. and these two having set down in abstracto, he
comes to divide them, in concreto, according to their several offices and
functions, which

be four in the Text. 1. The Teacher, or Doctor. v. 7. 2. The Exhorter, or
Pastor. v. 8. 3. The ruler, or governing Elder. also ^. 8. 4. The Distributer,
who is to show me ^^ on the poor, or the Deacon also. v. 8.

Then (4) the Apostle does set down the several specific actions and
operations of these offices, and that again

two ways. 1. in general. 1. Prophesying. v. 6. 2. Ministering. v. 7.

2. He sets down the operations and specific actions of the

four offices in particular, as 1. Teaching, in the Doctor. v. 7. 2.
Exhorting, in the pastor. v. 8. 3. Ruling in, the Elder. v. 8. 4. Distributing,
and showing mercy, in the Deacon. v. 8.

Then (5) he sets down the manner and holy qualification of these
operations, and exercises of their offices; and that also two ways. 1. In
general. 2. In the four particulars in

general. 1. In Prophesying; but how? according to the proportion of Faith v.
6. 2. Ministering, and how? By being given or addicted to Ministering v. 7. 2.
He sets them down in four particulars, as 1. The Doctor or Teacher, is to
be in, or given to Teaching. v. 7. 2. The pastor, is to be in Exhorting,
Sedulous and painful. v. 8. 3. The ruling Elder, to rule, (...) with
diligence. v. 8. 4. The Deacon is to distribute, and show mercy, on the Sick,
poor, imprisoned, stranger, distracted, in simplicity, in Cheerfulness. v.
8.

Also though it be true, that one and the same man may both teach and exhort,
and the comparison of the natural body does not in all things hold, for one
member cannot both be the eye to see, and the ear to hear, but both are here
a sort of eye to the Church; yet has Christ made the Pastor and the Doctor
different. (It is needless to dispute, if they differ in nature, and if it be
a confounding of Christ's order, that one be both, when Christ has given gifts
for both to one man) for first, the Word of God does difference them;
secondly, we know that many have gifts to teach, who are but dull and weak to
persuade and work upon the affection, as is observed amongst the Fathers.
Augustine excelled in teaching and disputing, Chryostome in exhorting. Salmeron
observes, that there Thomas Aquinas was Salmeron comment. in Rom 12. v. 8.
eminent in informing the understanding, and Bonaventura excellent for moving
the affections. And many are fitted to work on the affections, as Pastors, who
are not able to teach as Doctors in the Schools. So has Chrysostom and
Theodoret observed upon these words, Romans 12. 7, 8.

Nor does it move me much, that Paul speaks twice in one verse of the Deacon,
it is not unusual to the Spirit of God in diverse Scriptures so to do, as
Prove. 1. Prove. 2. Psalm. 119.

How dangerous it is to affirm, that all the Officers are not set down in
Gods Word, we may be taught by Papists, for Estius Estius com. in 1 Cor. 12.
Idem com. in Ephesians. c. 4. 11. Salmeron in 1 Cor. 12. 28.
gives a reason, why the Apostle setting down, 1 Cor. 12. 28. the Officers in
Gods house, has omitted the Pope; he answers, the Apostle is not here
setting down the degrees of the Hirarchicall Order, for then he should have
set down Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, which be parts of that Order, but only
he sets down some chief members of the Church, endued with rare gifts, and
commenting on Ephesians. 4. he says, The Pope is set down under the name of
Pastors and Doctors, because he sends Pastors and Doctors to all the world;
and this was the reason why the Prelate was reputed a Pastor, and the only
Pastor, because though it was too base for him to preach; yet he preached in
and through poor Presbyters whom he sent. And Salmeron moves the question,
why 1 Cor. 12. 28. the Pope, Cardinals, and Patriarchs are omitted in this
place; and we say, Why are Bishops, Archbishops, Primates, Metropolitans,
Deanes, Archdeacons, Chancellours, Officials, etc. never once mentioned in the
Word of God. But Salmeron answers, 1. They are implicitly set down here,
and under the name of helps, opitulations; Paul has instituted Deans,
Archdeans, and the four lesser orders. And what else do diverse answer, who
teach that government 1 Cor. 12. 28. is but a general; and the Church, in a
prudentiall way, under this may substitute and introduce such and such species
of governments as they shall find convenient, as ruling Elders, ruling
Prelates, and such like. but I would gladly know why the Spirit of God has
particularly set down the last specified Officers, as 1 Cor. 12. 28. Apostles,
under which are no species of Apostles, but only such individual persons,
Matthias, Paul, etc. and has also set down Pastors in specie, Doctors and
Teachers in specie, Ephesians. 4. 11. under which there be only such individual
persons who are Pastors and Teachers, as John, Epaphroditus, Archippus, Thomas,
etc. and there is no room left for the Church to subdivide Pastors or Doctors
into such and such new sp^cies, as Popes, Cardinals, etc. and yet under the
general of governments, many species and new kinds of governments in a
prudentiall way may be brought in. If Christ have set down the particulars of
Pastors, Prophets, Apostles, according to their last specified nature, why has
his wisdom not been as express and particular in all other offices necessary
for feeding and governing the flock of Christ? a Pope, a Prelate, a Cardinal,
an Official, would take as small room in print, and in Christ's Testament, as
Apostle, Doctor, Pastor, though I grant they do take half so much more room
in the State and Parliament.

Of Deacons.
WE conceive, according to Gods Word Acts 6. that Deacons be of divine
institution, because when some poor widows were neglected in the daily
ministration, the Apostles appointed seven men of good report, and full of the
holy Ghost, to take care of Tables and provide for the poor, that the Apostles
might give themselves to the Word and Prayer.

Object. 1. There is not one word of Deacons, Acts 6. not one word of the
poverty of widows, and these seven were but civil curators and tutors of the
widows, and not Church Officers, for any thing that can be collected from Gods
Word.
Answ. The equivalent of a Deacon in name, is Acts 6. there are those who are
not to preach the Word, but are to serve Tables, (...) and some did complain
because their widows were neglected, (...), if widows were neglected through
the want of a daily Deaconry, the Text must insinuate a Deaconry, and a want of
a Table to these widows. Secondly, it is unknown divinity, that the twelve
Apostles in a Church-assembly do institute, and that with solemn prayer, and
imposition of hands, officers merely civil to tutor widows. Thirdly, the
daily ministration was the want of sustenance, as it is said, That certain
women ministered to Christ of their Luke 8. 3.
substance, (...), Acts 20. 34. Yea your selves do know that those hands have
ministered to my necessities. And is it like that the Apostles were civil
curators to widows before this time?

Object. 2. It is evident from the Text that these Deacons were not of divine
institution, but of a mere temporary erection, for the present necessity of
the Church. First, it is said they were appointed, Acts 6. 1. (...). Secondly,
they were erected upon occasion of the multiplying of the disciples. Thirdly,
upon occasion of the poverty of widows, and therefore when there be no poor,
there is no need of Deacons, and so it is but an office of a temporary standing
in the Church.
Answ. These words (in those days) are not so much referred to the institution
of Deacons, as to the order of the history. Secondly, to Satan's malice, who
raised a schism in the Church, when the number of Disciples grew. And thirdly,
are referred to the murmuring of the widows; and they do no more prove that
Deacons are a temporary institution, and brought in, by the Church, in a
prudentiall way for the Chuches present necessity, then the Lords Supper is
concluded to be but a temporary and prudentiall institution of the Church,
because it is said, In the night that Jesus was betrayed, he took bread, etc.
Secondly, the occasion of the multiplying of Disciples and the neglecting of
the widows, does not prove that Deacons are a prudentiall and temporary
institution: for here I distinguish betwixt an occasion and a motive and cause;
diverse Ordinances of God have both these. As the occasion of writing the
Epistle to Philamon, was the flight of Onesmus a fugitive servant from his
master, and his willing mind to return to him again, and upon that occasion
Paul did write to Philamon; but that will not prove that the Epistle to
Philemon is but a prudentiall Letter, and obliging for a time, because the
motive and cause why the holy Ghost would have it written, was, that it should
be a part of Canonical Scripture, obliging to the second coming of Christ.
The like I say of the Epistle to the Galathians, written upon occasion of
seducing Teachers, who had bewitched the Galathians, and made them believe,
they must be circumcised and keep the Law, if they would be justified in
Christ: Yet hence is not proved, that the Epistle to the Galathians is but a
prudentiall Letter, and not of divine and perpetual institution; for the cause
and motive of writing was, that it might be a part of the Canon of faith. So
also the Covenant of Grace and the Gospel was made upon this occasion, by
reason that the first Covenant could not save us, Heb. 8. verse. 7. Romans 8 2. 3.
Gal. 3. 21, 22. is therefore (I pray you) the Covenant of grace but a temporary
and a prudentiall piece? Upon the occasion of the death of Zelophead, who died
in the wilderness without a male-childe, whose name thereby was in danger to
be delete and blotted out of Israel, the Lord makes a general Law through all
Israel, binding till the Messiah his coming, Numb. 27. 8. If a man die and
have no son, then shall you cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter;
this was no prudentiall Law. I might allege infinite Ordinances in Scripture,
the like to this. Yea, most of all the Ordinances of God are occasioned from
our spiritual necessities; are they therefore but humane and prudentiall
Statutes, that are only to endure for a time? I think, no.

Ob. 3. But if the civil Magistrate had been a friend to the Church, Acts 6.
his place had been to care for the poor, for the law of nature obliges him
to take care of the poor, therefore did a woman in the famine at the siege of
Samaria cry, Help O King; and if this were done by Christian Magistrates,
Pastors should be eased thereof, that they might give themselves to the Word
and Prayer, and there should be no need of a divine positive institution of
Deacons for this charge.
Answ. That the godly Magistrate is to take care of the poor, as they are
members of the Common wealth, I could easily grant. But this is not now in
question; but whether, or not, the Church, as it is an Ecclesiastical society,
should not have a treasure of the peoples E^angelike free-will-offering for the
necessity of the Saints, as Heb. 13. 16. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. 2 Cor. 9. 5, 6, 7, 8,
and concequently, whether or not Christ has ordained, not the Pastors, but
some officers besides, to attend this work? We affirm he has provided for
his poor members, even their bodily necessi ies. Secondly, if this be true,
that there should be no Deacon but the Christian Magistrate, then were these
seven Deacons but the Substitutes and Vicars of the Emperor and King. Now
certainly, if Apostolic benediction and laying on of hands, in the wisdom of
God was thought fit for the Vicars and Deputies of the Magistrates, it is like
that beside the coronation of the Roman Emperor, the twelve Apostles ought to
have blessed him with prayer, and separated him by laying on of hands for this
Deaconrie; for what Apostolic calling is necessary, for the temporary
substitute is more necessary, and at least that same way necessary for the
principal. But that civil Magistrates, ex officio, are to be separated for
this Church-office so holden forth to us, 1 Timothy 3. 12. I can hardly believe.
Thirdly, I see not what the Magistrate does in his office, but he does it as
the Minister of God who bears the sword, Romans 13 4. and if he should compel
to give alms, then should alms be a debt, and not an alms and
free-will-offering. It is t^u^, there may intervene some coaction to cause
every man to do his duty, and to force men to give to the poor; but then I
say, that forcing with the sword should not be an act of a separated
Church Officer, who, as such, uses no carnal weapons. Four^^ly, the law of
nature may lead to a supporting of the poor, but that hinders not but God may
ordain it as a Church-duty, and appoint a Church Officer to collect the bounty
of the Sain^^, 1 Cor. 16. 3. 5. I see not how the Apostle, 1 Timothy 3. should not
hold forth his Cannons concerning a Deacon, to the King, if he ex officio be
the Church-treasurer, but the Apostle does match him with the Bishop, Acts 6.
the appointing of the Deacon is not grounded Acts 6. upon the want of a
Christian Magistrate, but on another ground, that the Apostles must attend a
more necessary work, then Tables.

Object. 4. But the occasion of appointing Deacons was to disburden the Pastor,
who was to give himself wholly to preaching and praying; Ergo, at the first the
Apostles and so also Pastors were Deacons; if therefore the poor be fewer then
they were at Jerusalem, Act. 6. where the Church did exceedingly multiply;
this Office of Deaconry was to return to the Pastors, as its prime and native
subject; and therefore is not essentially and primarily an Office separated
from the Pastors Office. And if the poor cease to be at all, the Office
cease also.
Ans. I cannot well deny but it is apparent from Act. 6. 4. that the Apostles
themselves were once those who cared for the poor, but I deny that hence it
follows in the case of fewer poor, that the Office can return to the Pastors
as to the first subject, except you suppose the intervention of a divine
institution to place it again in the Pastors; as the power of judging Israel
was once in Samuel, but upon supposition that Saul was dead, that power cannot
return back to Samuel except you suppose that God by his authority shall
re-deliver and translate it back again to Samuel. For seeing God by positive
institution had turned the power of judging over from Samuel into the person of
Saul, and changed the same into a regal and Kingly power, that same authority
who changed the power must rechange it again, and place it in, and restore it
to its first subject. 2. The fewness of poor; or no poor at all, cannot be
supposed, Joh. 12. 8. for the poor you have always with you. And considering
the afflictions of the Churches, the object of the Deacons giving and showing
mercy, as it is Romans 12. 8. cannot be wanting, as that the Churches fabric be
kept in good frame, the poor, the captives of Christian Churches, the sick,
the wounded, the stranger, the distracted be relieved, yea and the poor Saints
of other Churches, 1 Cor. 16. be supported. 3. Not only because of the
impossibility that Pastors cannot give both themselves to praying and the Word,
and to the serving of Tables; but by reason of the wisdom of Christ in a
positive Law, the Pastor cannot be the Deacon ex officie in any case. For 1.
Christ has made them distinct Offices, upon good grounds, Act. 6. 4. 2. The
Apostle has set down diverse qualifications, for the Bishop, 1 Timothy 3. 1. and
for the Deacon, V. 12, 13. And 3. the Pastor who is to give the whole man to
the preaching of the Gospel, cannot entangle himself with Tables, 1 Timothy 4.
15. 2 Timothy 2. 3, 4, 5. if we should say nothing, that if there were need of
Officers to take care of the poor, when there was such grace and love amongst
the Saints and Apostles able and willing to acquit themselves toward the poor,
and when all things were common Act. 2. 44, 45, 46, 47. Act. 4. 31. 32, 33, 34.
far more now is the Office needful, when the love of many is waxen cold.

Object. 5. But if there were a community of goods, and no man lacked any
thing, Act. 5. 34. there were no poor at all, and so no need of Deacons.
Answ. This is to carpe at the wisdom of God, who appointed seven men to serve
Tables; for justice might say, those who had nothing to give to the public
treasury of the Church, should expect nothing thence, charity would say the
contrary.

Object. 6. Distribution of earthly goods is not such a thing, at requires a
spiritual Office; for money given by a Church Officer has no spiritual
influence on the poores necessity, more then money given by the Magistrate, or
one who has no Church-office.
Answ. I deny the consequence: for then the Priests killing of Bullockes to God
had no more influence, if we speak physically, then a Bullock killed by
another man. Now the Churches bounty and grace, 1 Cor. 16. 3. being a
spiritual offering to God, by virtue of Christ's institution, has more in it
then the common charity of an Heathen, if it were but for this, that the
wisdom of God, in his Ordinance is to be considered; and if we speak
physically, the Word of God has no more influence when spoken by a Pastor in
public, then when spoken by a private man; yet if we look to Gods Ordinance,
the one has more assistance when it is spoken, then the other, caeter is
paribus.

Object. 7. The Office of a Deacon is not mentioned in the Word, and what
should be his charge is scarcely holden forth in Scripture.
Answ. The Scripture says the contrary, 1 Timothy 3. 13. They that have used the
Office of the Deacons well, etc. V. 8. Likewise must the Deacon be grave, Phil.
1. 1. 2. The Scripture holds forth to us, that he must take care that Widows
and the poor be not neglected in the daily ministration, Act. 6. 1. and
therefore must he serve Tables, v. 2. And 3. he must be appointed over this
work, v. 3. and 4. look how far giving and showing mercy, and how far
singleness of heart and cherefulnesse in these things extend, as far must
the office of the Deacon extend, hence all in poverty, want, captivity, bonds,
sickness, are to be helped by him.

Object. 8. But it would seem, that a Deacon has a higher employment then to
distribute goods, and that he is to preach, as Stephen and Philip did: for 1.
they did choose men Act. 6. full of the Holy Ghost; now to be full of the holy
Ghost is a requisite in a preacher, and is not required in a man to distribute
money; yea these who are least esteemed in the Church, 1 Cor. 6. 4. may judge
in things pertaining to this life, Ergo, they may suffice to distribute (...),
things which belong to this life.
Answ. To distribute in a civil and natural way requires not a man full of
the Holy Ghost, but to distribute in simplicity, and with the grace of heavenly
cheerfulness, Romans 12. 8. and with the qualities of a complete Deacon, 1 Timothy
3. 12, 13, 14. requires the holy Ghost, though they may be good Deacons who
are not full of the holy Ghost, but such were chosen, 1. because this was to be
a rule to all 'Deacons to the Worlds end, and the rule should be as straight
and perfect as can be. 2. Because there were choice of such men, as those in
the Apostelike Church, and reason that God be served with the best of his own.
3. The Holy Ghost is required for sanctification, as well as for gifts of
preaching, Luke 1. 15. Matthew. 10. v. 20. 4. Stephen did no more chapter 7. in his
Apology then any witnesses of Christ convened before Rulers may do who are
obliged to be ready always to give an answer to every one who asks them of
the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear, 1 Pet. 3. 15. yea though it
were a woman who yet may not preach, 1 Cor. 14. 34. Philip was an Evangelist.
5. The Apostle, 2 Cor. 6. 4. does sharply check the Corinthians, for going to
Law one with another, before heathen Judges, whereas the smallest amongst them
might have supplied the bench of an heathen Judge in matters of this life, the
loss whereof was nothing comparable to the great scandal they gave. But there
is a greater grace required to the Church-distribution, and the official
regulating of the conscience in a constant office of distribution, then in a
transient and arbitrary act of deciding a matter of money.

Object, 9. 1 Timothy 3. 9. The Deacon must hold the mystery of the faith; Ergo,
he must be able to preach.
Answ. It follows not, for there is a twofold holding of the mystery of
faith: one for the preaching of sound doctrine recommended to Timothy, of this
Paul does not speak; there is another holding of faith for steadfast believers,
and for an holy and blameless conversation; and therefore it is not said
simply, holding the mystory of faith, but, holding the mystery of faith in a
pure conscience. In which sense Christ says to the Church of Pergamus, Rev. 2.
13. Thou hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith. And Paul says of
himself, 2 Timothy 4. 7. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith. He means not, that he kept so much of the knowledge of
the sound doctrine of faith as made him fit for the ministry, and qualified
him to teach, and 1 Timothy 1. 19. holding faith and a good conscience, which is
meant of the grace of saving faith. But that the Deacon is not to preach is,
clear, 1. because Paul clearly differenceth the Deacon from the preaching
Elder, 1 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 12, 13. and requires that the preaching Elder be apt to
teach, but requires not this of the Deacon, and Act. 6. they are made two
Offices not consistent in one man; for if the Deacon must be a Teacher, he must
either be a Teacher as a gifted man, or he must be a Teacher in Office; he
cannot ex officio, by his Office, be a Teacher as a gifted man, for the
authors of that opinion hold that men are Preachers that way as Christians,
and so the Deacon though he were not a Deacon, he might be a teacher in that
sense, though he were only a gifted Christian: Ergo, he cannot be such a
teacher by his Office: but neither can he be an official teacher as a Deacon,
for he who does teach that way must also pray, for the one cannot be granted,
and the other denied; if then the Deacon, ex officio, by his office must pray
and preach; he must pray and preach (...) in season and out of seasor, and give
himself to it. But if he must give himself to praying and preaching by his
office, then by his office he must give over the sorving of Tables, as is said,
Act. 6. 2. and if he must leave Tables by his office, the Deacon by his office
must quit and give up his office, and it shall belong to the Deacon by his
office, to be no Deacon. 2. Whoever by his office may teach, by his office may
administer the Sacraments, for Christ gives one and the same royal Patent and
Commission for both, Matthew. 28 19. 1 Cor. 11. 23. Joh. 4. 1, 2. but this is to
be a Minister by Office, and so a Deacon, as a Deacon, is a Pastor. 3. The
Deacons office is to preach if he be thereto called by the Bishop: hence the
Bishop is the principal and sole Pastor; the Preacher, Elder, and Deacon, none
of them may preach or baptize, except they be called thereunto by the bishop.
Hence judge what a Pastor that man i^, who actu primo, and by office is a
preacher, but cannot nor may not exercise his Office, but by the will of a
mortal man.

Object. 10. The Deacon must be the husband of one wife, ruling his children
and his own house well 1 Timothy 3. 12. Ergo, he must be able to govern the
Church well, no l^sse then the Pastor of whom the same qualification is
required, v. 5. and so the Deacon must be somewhat more then a carer for the
poor.
Answ. The Deacon is never called (...) a Ruler; nor is that same dignity of
ruling the Church put upon the Deacon, v. 12. which is put upon the Pastor, v.
5. Nor are these same words spoken of both. Nor is it said that the Deacon must
rule the House of God; but the meaning is, he who cannot rule his own children
and house shall not be able to rule the Hospital houses of the poor and
sick; and this ruling is nothing but a cari^g for tables, and for the houses
of the poor. Whereas taking care for the house of God is given to the Pastor,
v. 5. but if you give to the Deacon the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, he is
higher then his first institution can bear, Act. 6. where he is expressly
removed from all official meddling with word and prayer, and set to the serving
of Tables.

Object. 11. The Deacon by his Office is to serve Tables, Act. 6. 2. that is,
to administer the Sacraments, at least he is by office to baptize; for Jesus
himself baptized not, but his Disciples, Io^. 4. 2. and Christ sent not Paul
to baptize, but to preach; therefore the dpostles baptized by others, by
Deacons, and by others whose ministry and help they used in baptizing, Ergo,
the Deacons office is not only to care for the poor.
Answ. I yield that the Deacon is to serve at the communion Table, and provide
the Elements, and to carry the Cup at the Table: but that is no ways the
meaning of serving Tables in this place, Acts 6. 2. because the serving of
Tables, here, is such a service, as was a remedy of the Widows neglected in
the daily ministration, for of this neglect they complain v. 1. but they did
not complain that they were neglected of the benefit of the Lords Supper, for
the Apostles do never think that the administration of the Lords Supper is a
burden which they put off themselves as inconsistent with the preaching of the
word and prayer, and which they devolve wholly over to Deacons, Its not so
says the sixth council, and Chrysostom seems to 6. Synod. can 16. invenimus
eos esselocutos (Act. 6 non de viris qui ministrant mysterits, sed de
ministerio quod in usu mensarun^ ad hibebatur, secundum Chrysostom.

Chryost. ^omil. 13. ^ act.


teach the same; and because a Table signifies an Altar, (as Salmeron says)
therefore some papists say that Deacons served at the Altar; and so says
pontificale Romanum oportet diaconum ministrare ad altar, Baptizare, and
praedicare: and Salmeron says, to serve at the altar is essential to the
Deacon, but to preach and baptize agrees to him by commission and of
necessity. 2. The Apostles in the Text, Acts 6. do denude themselves, of
serving of Tables in an official way, or, as serving of Tables was a peculiar
office imposed upon seven men, of honest report, and full of the Holy Ghost,
with apostolic benediction, and laying on of the hands of the Apostles, and
do manifestly make it an office different from their pastoral charge, which
was to give themselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word,
v. 3. 4. for baptizing cannot but include praying and preaching. Mat. 28. 19.
or at least must be necessarily conjoined in one and the same Church Officer;
for where does the word of God hold forth to us such a rare and strange
Creature, who by office is to baptize, but by office is neither to preach nor
pray? now the Text does clearly difference the office of serving Tables, and
the office of continual praying and preaching, as not consistent in one person
v. 3. 4, 5, 6.

Object. 12. Paul, 1 Timothy 3. requires that the Deacon v. 10. should first be
tried, and thereafter use the office, so he be found blameles; Ergo, the Deacon
must be ordained with imposition of hands, as the presbyter, and so must be, by
office, some more eminent person, then one who serves Tables only; for grace
was given to Timothy; by the laying on of hands, 1 Timothy 3. 14. and Chrysostom
observes, that Steven did no miracles; nor did he speak with wisdom, that the
adversaries were not able to resist v. 8. 9. 10. till first he was appointed a
Deacon, by imposition of hands, which evidenceth to us more then a poor office
of giving alms to the poor.
Answ. There is need that Deacons be tried; and it is said, they must be found
(...), blameless in conversation, not (...), apt to teach, which is required
in a Teacher, 1 Timothy 3. 1. for these who are to show mercy with cheerfulnes,
and to give with simplicity, as Deacons must by their office do, Romans 12. 8.
must be of approved and tried blamelesnes, lest they detrand the poor. 2. It
is not said that Deacons were ordained with fasting and prayer, Acts 6. as the
Elders are chosen in every Church, Acts 14. 23. and as hands are laid upon Paul
and Barnabas; Acts 13. v. 3. 4. but simply that the Apostles, Acts 6. 6. prayed
and laid their hands on them. Which seems to me, to be nothing, but a sign
of praying over the Deacons, and no ceremony, or Sacrament conferring on them
the Holy Ghost; And Steven his working of miracles, and speaking with wisdom
irresistible, was but the fruit of that grace and extraordinary measure of the
Holy Ghost, abundantly powered forth on all ranks of persons, in those days,
when the prophecy of Iocl was now taking its accomplishment; Act. 2. 16, 17, 18
19. Iocl. 2. 28. 29. which grace was in Steven before he was ordained a
Deacon, by the laying on of hands. Act. 6. 3, 4, 5. And the Text says not that
Steven did wonders and signs amongst the people by virtue of imposition of
hands, or of his Deaconry, but because he was full of faith and power. v. 8.
else you must make working of miracles a gift bestowed on all those who serve
Tables, and are not to give themselves to continual praying, and the Ministry
of the Word. I think, papists will not say so much of all their priests; and
we can say it of none of our pastors, nor does Chysostome say that Steven, as a
Deacon, and by virtue of the office of a Deacon wrought miracles; but only
that his miracles and disputing was a mere consequent of laying on of hands.
Fa^ther laying on of hands was taken from the cus^ome of blessing amongst the
Jews, Christ laid his hands upon young children and blessed them, yet did he
not, thereby, design them to any office. The fourth council of Carthage
says, Deacons should administer the Sacraments; but times were growing worse
then: and two things in ancient times made the office degenerate. 1. The
l^zinesse of pastors who laid preaching and baptizing on the Deacon. 2. The
Deacons having in their hands aerarium Ecclesiasticum, the Church Treasury, as
the Church became rich, the Deacons were exalted; and then came in their
Archiliaconi, Archdeacons and Deacons, and so some Deacons were above pastors,
whereas Acts 6. in their first institution they were inferior to pastors; this
moved Spalato to tell us of two sorts of Deacons, the apostolic Deacons, which
we assert, and the ecclesiastic Deacons, popi^ and of the newest cut; which we
discla^me.

As concerning the perpetuity of Deacons. I conceive that Deacons must be as
permanent in the Church, as distribution and showing mercy on the poor.

Ob. 13. How do those words Act. 6. v. 7. and the word of God grew, and the
number of Disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, etc. follow upon the
institution of Deacons v. 2, 3 4. 5, 6. if Deacons were not, according to their
primitive institution and Office, ordained to be Preachers of the word, by
whose pains the word grew?
Answ. The cohesion three ways is good. 1. Because the Apostles being
exonerated of serving Tables, and giving themselves to continual praying and
the ministry of the word v. 2. Through the constituting of the seven Deacons
the word thereby did grow (2) Satan stirred up a schism betwixt the Grecians
and Hebrews, which is prejudicial to the growth of the Gospel and Church,
yet the Lord being superabundantly gracious, where Satan is exceedingly
malicious, will have his Gospel and Church to flourish. 3. These words v. 7.
do cohere kindly with the last verse of the foregoing Chapter. v. 41. And
daily in the Temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach
Jesus Christ and Chapter 6. v. 7. And the word of God increased, etc. God blessing
the labors of his persecuted Apostles, and the story of the ordained Deacons
is cast in by Luke upon occasion of the neglected Grecian Widows, and the
growth of the word could not arise from the appointing of such officers who
were not to labor in the word and prayer, but employed about Tables, to the
end that the Apostles might labor in the word and prayer.

Ob. 14. But does not the faithful administration of the Deacons office,
purchase to the Deacon a good degree, that is, does it make him ^^^ter in a
preparatory way to be a Pastor?
Answ. The word of God, 1 Timothy 3. and elsewhere setting down the qualification
and previous dispositions of a Teacher, does no where teach us, that none can
be a minister, but he who is first a Deacon. 2. Didcclavius says, many are
faithful Deacons who are never Teachers, nor apt to be Teachers, and many in
the ancient Church were, of lay men, made Teache^r. Ambrosius heri

grants, many good Deacons can never be Teachers, because of their ignorance.

Hugo Cardinal says, this is only against these, qui subito ascendunt in
pr^lationes, who suddenly ascend to prelacies, Cornelius a lapide says, ut
promereantur altius promoveri in sacerdotia; they are to serve so, as they may
deserve to be promoted to higher places; but this does not infer that none can
be presbyters who have not first been Deacons. As Chrysostom says, we use
not to place a novice in an high place, antequam fidei suae and vitae dederit
doc^m^nta, before he have given proof of his faith, and good conversation.
And Cyprian writing to Antonianus, commends Cornelius that he came not by a
leap and suddenly to be a Bishop, sed per omnia ecclesiastica officia
promotus, being promoted by degrees to all Church-Offices; and Bernard
follows the same meaning. Lyra, merebu^tur quod fiant sacerdotes, acquirunt
altiorem gradum, says Salmeron. Now it is clear that the fathers and papists
could extort no more out of the Text; but that he who uses the office of a
Deacon well, does deserve of the Church, to be promoted to an higher office,
but there is no ground for papists, or others to make the Deacons office a
necessiary degree, without the which none can be a Teacher. Sozomen l. 5. c. 8.

Eusebius says, the care of the poor and the keeping of the Church and the

Ruffinus says, Deacons disputed in Synods; and Athanasius, when he was a
Deacon, helped his Bishop Alexander at the Nicen council; but this came (as I
suppose) because about the fourth century, they were admitted to be scribes in
Synods Ambros. c. 4. ad Ephesians.
Ambrose says at the beginning, Deacons did preach and baptize, but after when
the Church was well furnished with officers, they durst not presume to teach.

Ruffinus says, then the Deacon might distribute the Elements.

I conceive, the place 1 Timothy 5. says, that Widows were in the Apostolic
Church, both poor aged Women, who were to be mantained by the Church, and also
auxiliary helps, for mere service to help the Deacons in these hot Countries.

Ecclesiae oblationibus sustententur, say Salmer. com. in loc.
Salmeron and Estius in loc.
Estius; and Cornelius Cornelius a lapid. com. in loc.
a lapide, says, as ( honor thy Father and thy Mother) does include ( h^norem
sustentationis) that children are to give the honor of maintenance to their
indigent parents, no less then the honor of obedience and reverence, so are
Widows to have this honor. (2) It is said, if any VVidow have children or
nephews, let them learn first to show mercy at home, and to requite their
Parents; Ergo, the children or grand children of these Widows were to
sustain them, and not to burden the Church, with them, and so they were poor
Widows; and this. 3. The Text clearly holds forth, while the Apostle
proves that the children who are able, are to help the Parent being a
desolate Widow; because v. 8. all are to provide for these of their own house,
and to maintain them in their indigence, else they be, in that, worse then
Infidel children, who by natures love, do provide for their poor parents. 3.
This is clear from, v. 16. if any man or woman that believes, has widows,
let them relieve them, and let not the Church be charged, that they may relieve
them that are widows indeed; Ergo, these widows called also, v. 3. widows
indeed, did some way burden the Church with their maintenance, and they were
not to be laid upon the Churches stock, to be maintained thereby, except they
were desolate and without friends.

But some may object, if these widows had a charge, and did any work or
service to the Church, ( as it is clear from the Text, v 9. they did) in
overseeing the poor, and the sick, were not wages due to them, for their
work? for the labourer is worthy of his hire; the Scripture says not, if a
Preacher have a father who is Rich, and may sustain his Son; let not the
Church be burdened with his wages, but on the contrary, the Preacher is to have
his wages for his work, as an hire; ad modum debiti, non ad modum eleemo^ynae;
as a debt, not as an Alms. I answer, the reason is not alike of the preaching
Elder, and of the Widow; for the pastors service requiring the whole man was of
that nature, that it was a work deserving wages, as any worke-man, a dresser
of a Vineyard deserves wages, 1 Cor. 9 7. or a plower, or one that Thresheth
v. 10. Therefore the Preachers wages is so wages that its debt, not alms: but
a Widow of sixty years being weak and infirm, cannot acquit her self, in
such a painful office as does merit poor wages, and therefore the reward of
her labor was both wages and an alms.

Again, that this Widow had some charge or service in the Church, (I mean not
any Ministerial office, for she was not ordained as the Deacon, Acts 6. with
imposition of hands) I prove from the Text. 1. Because this Widow was not to
be chosen to the number or College of Widows, except she had been 60.
Years, this is a positive qualification of a positive service, as if it were
an office; for else what more reason in 60. Years then in 61. or 62. or in 58.
or 59. if she was a mere eleemosynary and an indigent woman? or can
godliness permit us to think that Paul would exclude a Widow of 50. or 54. or
56 Years, from the College of Widows, who were desolate and poor? nor, 2.
Would Paul rebuke the Widow taken into the society of these Widows, because
she married an husband, except she had entered to this service, and had vowed
chastity, nor is marrying the second time which is lawful, Romans 7. 1. 2. a
waxing wanton against Christ and a casting off of the first faith; as the
marrying of these widows is called. v. 11. 12. therefore this Widow, had some
charge and service, in the Church. 3. The word (...) let a Widow be chosen of
such an age, and not younger, and with such moral qualifications, as is
required in the Deacon, etc. does also evidence that it was an election to some
service or charge, as is she be of good report, if she have brought up her
children; if she have lodged strangers; if she have washed the saints feet;
which qualifications not being in a Widow poor and desolate, cannot exclude
her from the Churches alms, and expose her to famishing for want: this also
does Ambrose, Augustine, tract. 58. in Joan. Chrysostomus, Theophylact.
Hieronymus observe on this place; It is not unprobable to me that Phaebe called
a Deacon, or servant of the Church of Cenchrea, was such a Widow, seeing she is
Romans 16. 1. expressly so called: how she came to Rome, if she was a poor
Widow and now 60. years old, I dispute not, seeing Gods Spirit calls her
so. We can easily yield that Widows of sixty years entering to this service
did vow not to marry again; so teach Cyprian. l. 1. epist* ad Pomponium,
Hyeronym. contr. Jovia^. Epihan. 48.

The last Canon of the council of Nice (as Ruffinus l. 1. c. 6. says) denies
Widows to be Church Officers, because they were not ordained with imposition
of hands. Hyeronimus in c. 16. ad Roman. says, Diaconisses in the Oriental
Church had some service in Baptism. Epiphanius l. 3. tom. 2. Here Is. 79. says,
they were in the Church, non ad sacrificandum, sed propter horam Balnci, aut
visitationis -- quando nudatum fuit corpus ^^lieris. Constantine placed them
amongst the Clergy, to govern the Corpse of the dead; but Papists then have no
warrant for their Nuns.

CHAP. 8. SECT. 8.
Of Election of Officers.
HEre the Author teaches, that Election of Officers belongs to the Church
whose officers they are. 2. That the Church of The way of the Churches of
Christ.
believers, being destitute of all officers, may ordain their own officers and
Presbyters, by imposition of hands, in respect that the power of the keys is
given to the Church of believers, Mar. 18.

Answ. Election of Officers (no doubt) belongs to the whole Church, not in
the meaning of our Brethren; but that this may be cleared, whether a Church
without officers, may ordain Elders, there be diverse other questions here to
be agitated; as 1.

Whether the Church be before the Ministry, or the Ministry before the
Churches.

1. Did. There is an ordinary, and an extraordinary Ministry.

2. There is a mystical Church of believers, and a ministerial Church of
Pastors and flock.

3. A Church may be so called by anticipation, as Hos. 12. Jacob served for a
wise; or formally, because it is constituted in its whole being.

4. A Ministry is a Ministry to these, who are not as yet professors, but
only potentially members of the Church.

1. Concl. There is a Church of believers sometime before there be a
ministerial Church. 1. Because a company of believers is a mystical Church,
for which Christ died, Ephesians. 5. 25. And such there may be before there be a
settled Ministry. As there is a house, before there be a Candlestick, because
conversion may be by private means, as by reading and conference; yea a woman
has carried the Gospel to a Land, before there was a Ministry in it. 2. Adam
was first and Evah by order of nature a Church created of God, before there was
a Ministry; So Adams Ministry is founded upon a nature created according to
Gods Image.

2. Concl. A public ordinary Ministry is before a Church of believers. Ephesians.
4. 11. Pastors, Teachers, and a Ministry, are given to the inbringing and
gathering of the Church; (...). That is, edifying, and not only for
confirming, but for the converting of the Body of Christ. Nor is Robinson
Robinson Just. of s^pa^. p. 320.
and his fellows here to be heard, that the word of restoring is the same
which is used, Gal. 6. 1. and so nothing is meant but repairing of Christians
already converted, not the converting of these who are yet unconverted. But I
Answer 1. The Word of restoring does no more import that they were converted
before, then the word of renewing, Ephesians. 4. 23. Romans 12. 2. and the word of
awaking from sleep of sinners, Ep^. 5. 14. does import that these were new
Creatures before, and that they had the life of God, before they be said to be
renewed again and made new, and awaked out of their sleep. And this Pelagian
and popish exposition, is a fair way to elude all the places for the power of
grace; and to help Papists and Arminian^. 2. By this there is, 1. no necessity
of a public Ministry, for the conversion of Souls to Christ, nor is a
Ministry and Pastors, and Teachers given by Jesus Christ, with intention, to
open the eyes of the blind, and to convert souls to God. All the ordinary
ways of conversion of Souls, is by the preaching of men out of office, and
destitute of all calling of the Church to preach, which is a wonder. 3. The
Fathers begetting, by order of nature, are before the children; the pastors are
Fathers, the seed before the plant or birth; the word preached, Romans 10. 14.
is the immortal seed of the new birth, 1 Pet. 1. 23. The Ministry and
ordinary use thereof, is given to the pastors as to Christ's Ambassadors, 2
Cor. 5. 18. 20. Therefore the Ministry is before the Church of believers,
though we will not tie the Lord to these only: yet is this his ordinary
established way: but more of this hereafter.

Robinson objecteth Just of separ. p. 320. 321.
The Apostles and brethren were a Church of God, Acts 2. 25. when as yet no
Pastors or Teachers were appointed in it. How then are the Ministers spoken of
Ephesians. 4. 11. before the Church out of which they were taken? yea the office of
pastors was not heard of in the Church then. Ans. 1. It is clear there were in
that meeting, eleven Apostles called to be pastors; Mat. 10. 1, 2, 3. sent of
God, Mat 29. 19 inspired or the Holy Ghost to open and shut Heaven, Ioh. 20.
21, 22. Before Christ's ascension; and this meeting was after his ascension,
Acts. 1. 15. and here was a governing Church, and without the Apostles, an
Apostle could not be chosen and called by men. And an instance of such a
calling is not in Gods Word. 2. He objecteth. The Apostles themselves, were
first Christians and members of the Church, before they were Ministers.

Answ. Men may be a Church of Christians, and a mystical Church before they
have a Ministry, but they are not a governing Church, having the power of the
keys, so long as they want officers and stewards, who only have warrant
ordinary of Christ to use the keys.

3. He objecteth, God 1 Cor. 12. 28. has set officers in the Church; Ergo, the
Church is before the Officers, as the setting of a Candle in a Candlestick.
presupposes a Candlestick. The Church is the candlestick. Rev. 1. The officers
candles, lights, stars

Answ. God has put and breathed in man a living soul. Ergo, he is a living
man, before the soul be breathed in him: friend your logic is naught. The
Church is the Candlestick, not simply without Candles and Lamps: the Church
ministerial is the Candlestick, and the Ministers the Candles set in the
Church ministerial, as Eyes and Ears are seated, and all the seals are
seated in a living man; Ergo, he is a living man before the senses be seated in
him, it follows in no sort. Because by the candles seating in the Church, the
Church becomes a ministerial and governing Church: It is as you would say
the Lord gives the wife to the husband; Ergo. He is an husband before God give
him the wife.

4. He objecteth. That it is senseles, that a Minister may be sent as a
Minister, to the hidden number not yet called out, which are also his st^ck
potentially, not actually; as Mr. Bernard says, because it is the property of
a good shepherd, to call his own sheep by name. Ioh. 20. also it is a logical
error, that a man may have a^ actual relation to a stock potentially, it is as
if a man were a husband because he may have a wife.

But I answer; he not only may be, but is a pastor to these that are but
potentially members to the invisible Church, though unconverted, except you
say, a man has no relation as a pastor to the flock, to all and every one of a
thousand souls, which are his flock, except they be all truly converted, and
members of the invisible Church, which if you say, I can refute it easily as an
Anabaptisticall falsehood; for if they all profess the truth, and choose him
for their pastor, he is their pastor, but they are a saved flock potentially,
though actually a visible flock having actual relation to him, as to their
pastor.

But. 2. That a good minister know all his flock by name, be requisite, and is
spoken of Christ* Ioh. 10. in relation to the whole Catholic Church, as is
expounded v. 14. yet will it not follow, he is not a pastor nor not a good
pastor, who knows not all his flock at all times. 3. A man is indeed not
properly a pastor, and a Church officer to Indians, who neither are called nor
profess the truth, if he preach to them, though he have not relation to such,
as to a Christian flock, yet he has a relation of a pastor to them in that
case.

Yea I desire our brethren to satisfy me in this even according to their
grounds. A number of Christians is a Church mystical, but they are not a
Church ministerial, while they be conjoined covenant-wayes, and use the keys
in such acts of Church union: Ergo, They are not a Church ministerial before
they be a Church governing: which is all we say; for then they should be a
body seeing and hearing, before they be a body seeing and hearing.

Quest. 2. Whether there be any Church in the Scripture having power of the
keys, yet wanting all Church Officers?

The Question is near to the former, yet needful in this matter to be
discussed. The Question is not, if the name Church be given to a company of
Christians, without relation to their Officers, for the word (...) is given to
a civil meeting. The Hebrews call, sometimes, any meeting of people a Church:
as (...) does sometime signify, Genesis 49. 6. my soul come not thou (...) to
their assembly. So the Rabbines use (...) for a place, where the Congregation
meets. So the Chaldaick and Arabic use (...), for the place where the
worshippers met, from (...) Caldaice and Syriace, Adoravit, because it is a
place of meeting for adoration; and (...) the Congregation from the Arabic
(...) congregavit. Yet speaking of a governing and orderly constituted Church,
you shall never find, such a Church having the name of a Church, but such a
company as has officers, and is spoken of as a house and family, where there
are stewards, keys, doors, bread and other things noting a City-incorporation.

1. Because the keys are given to stewards, who, by* office, bear the keys;
for taking in and casting out, by power of censures, is proper to an ordered
City, where there are governors, and people governed. 2. Because we read not
that the keys are given to a company of single believers, out of office. 3.
We never find in the word of God, any practice, or precept, that a single
company did use the keys, or can use them, wanting all Officers.

Hear what Robinson objecteth, that he may establish a popular government.
Robinson. Just. separ p. 107. 108.
Two or three making Peter's confession, Mat. 16. are a Church. But two or three
may make this confession without officers; Ergo, The proposition is clear, by
the promise made to build the Church upon the Rock of Peter's confession.

Answ. 1. I deny the proposition, and it is not proved: two or three making
Peter's confession are not the Church ministerial, to which Christ gave the
keys; for the keys include pastoral power to preach and baptize, which
Separatists Confess art. 37.
deny to two or three wanting officers, they may be a mystical Church or a
part of the redeemed Church, Ephesians. 3. 25. 26. nor does Christ promise to build
the ministerial Church properly on the rock, but only the Church of believers,
for whom he gave the keys, but to whom he gave no keys. 2. This argument will
hurt our brethren: for two or three not entered in Church State, nor in
Courch-Covenant, without Church State, as well, as without officers, may, and
do often make Peter's confession; yet are they not for that a governing Church,
because they may not happily as yet be united covenant-wayes.

2. He objecteth, If the Apostles appoint Elders in every Church. Acts 14. 23.
If God se^ in the Church Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, 1 Cor 12. 28. Then there
is a Church before Officers, Apostles, Prophets: a Major presupposes there was
a City, before he was Major, a Steward presupposes a family; is not the
Eldership an ordinance of the Church, and called the Elders of the Church? The
Church is not an ordinance of the Elders, or given ^^ the Elders.

Ans. Job. 10. 20. God has granted to Job life; Ergo, Job was a living man
before God had given him life. The Lord breathed in man the breath of life;
Ergo, he was a breathing and a living man, before God breathed that life in
him. God formed man of the dust, Genesis 2. 7. Ergo, he was a man before God
formed him. All these are as good consequences. So Iac^^ served for a wife,
Hos. 12. 12. Ergo, she was his wife before he served for her; it follows not.

2. This proves not there is a governing Church without Officers, but the
contrary, because for that end does the Lord appoint Elders in every Church,
and a ruler in a City, a King in a Kingdom, to govern them, to feed the
flock, Acts 20. 28. Ergo, before there be Officers in a Church, there is no
government in it. And so it is not a governing Church; nor is a City a
governing incorporation without a Major or some other Rulers, nor a Kingdom a
monarchical state without a King. And so the Elders, are the Churches Elders,
as life is the form of a living man. And this argument is much against them
God (say our Brethren) has appointed a Church Covenant, in his Church, will it
follow: Ergo, there is a Church, before a Church Covenant; They cannot say this.

3. These with whom ( says Robinson) God has made a covenant, lb. 108.
to be their God, and to have them his people, and to dwell it them as his
Temple, which have right to the promises of Christ and his presence, are his
Church. But a company of believers without Officers are such; Ergo, The
proposition is Scripture, Genesis 17. 17. Levi. 26. 11, 12. Mat. 18. 17. The
assumption is true, because they may believe, separate themselves from the
world, come out of Babel without Officers, except you say they must go to Rome,
to Jerusalem, and beyond sea, to seek a Church.

Answ. The major is false; for God is in covenant with six believers before
they swear a Church Covenant, and so all the promises are made to them, and
yet by your grant, they are not a Church. Yea all these agree to the invisible
Church, and every single member thereof. 2. Without officers, believers may not
separate themselves from the world, and come out of Babel, by a positive and
authoritative separation, to erect a new Church without pastors, or in an
ordinary way; though as Christians they may separate from Rome, negatively and
touch no unclean things. 3. We send none to Jerusalem and Babylon to seek a
Church yet, but except we fall unto the Tenets of Anabaptists, Socinians and
Arminians: we must send farther then to every house, where three believers
are, to seek such as have warrant from Christ to adminstrate the seals of
grace, except you in casting down Babel, build Jericho, and raise up a Tower
of confusion, and evert the ministerial order that Christ has appointed in
his Church.

4. Then how often (says he) the Officers die, so often the Church dies also;
to remove the candlestick is to dischurch the assembly; but the death of
Officers (which may be in a great persecution) is never said to be a
dischurching of an assembly. And all communion of Saints shall perish, when the
Officers are removed; for Baptism is without the visible Church; Ephesians. 4.

Answ. 1. When the shepherds are removed, the Tents cannot be called the
Shepherds Tents, and persecution often does deface the visible face of a
Ministerial Church, and to remove the candlestick is to remove the ministry,
as to take away eyes, and ears and hands from the body, is to hurt the
integrity of it, and make it lame. 2. All communion Ministerial whereby we are
a body visible, 1 Cor. 10. 16. eating one bread, may well be loosed, when
pastors are removed, whose only it is, by your own confession, to
administrate the Sacraments, except you allow all to administrate the Lords
Supper, and women to Baptize; nor is there a communion in a family betwixt
husband and wife, if you remove husband and wife out of the family, except, you
mean a communion by way of charity, to rebuke, exhort, comfort one another,
which communion is betwixt two independent congregations, who are not in
Church State one to another: but if you mean in Church Communion, take heed
that the keys of every christian family, and the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
be not by this, made all one.

Also it is (says he) unequal dealing to make a profane multitude, Robins.
Just of sepa^. p. 110. 11^
under a diocesian prelate a Church, and to deny, that a company of faithful
believers is a Church. 2. God has not tied his power or presence to any order,
or office of the world, but accepts of them that fear him, and work
Righteousness. 3. A power to enjoy the officers is seated in the body, as an
essential property. 4. The Lord calls the body of the Saints the Church,
excluding the Elders Acts 20. 17. 28. 1 Timothy 3. 15. because the Church is
essentially in the saints, as the matter and subject formed by the covenant,
unto the which the Officers are but adjuncts, not making for the being, but for
the welbeing of the Church, and so the furtherance of their faith and their
service.

Answ. A profane multitude under a diocesian prelate, is not a Church mystical
of redeemed ones, as a company of Believers are, but professing the truth and
consisting of a flock of called Officers, they may well be a Ministerial
Church, which four Believers cannot be. It is true God has not tied his power
and presence to any order or office, as Anabaptists say: and so speaks the
Catech. of Raccovia Catech. Rac. de eccles. chapter p. 301. 302.
and Smalcius Smalcius in refut. thesiii Dr. sra^zii. par. 2. disp. 4 p. 379.
and Nicolaides Nicolai^. in defens. tract. Socinian^ de ministr. missione
contra Miedziboz^um p. 140.
say, there is no necessity of a Ministry, after that the Evangel i^ preached
by the Apostles and confirmed by miracles: and that a Ministry is only
profitable ad been esse, and not necessary; The Arminians teach so, the Remons.
apol. f. 246.
Remonstrantes, praedicationem verbi ad id simpliciter necessariam negant: quid
clarius? So Episcop. disp. 28. These. 11.
Eipscopius, pastoris actio non tam necessaria est quam utilis ad
edificationem, postquam Scriptura omnibus and singulis legenda data est, ut ex
ca suopte Mart discat quisque quantum satis est. But Paul makes it in the
ordinary way, necessary for salvation to believe, Romans 10. 14, 15.
to call on the Name of the Lord, and to hear a Prophet sent; and the presence
and power of God in the Seals of Righteousness, is tied to lawful Pastors, who
only can administrate those Seals, Mat. 28. 19. as to means ordained of God,
not as if God could not save without them, and accept the righteous doers
without them, but see how this man would bear us in hand, that the comfort of
pastoral preaching and the Sacraments cannot be tied to called Ministers,
exccept we call God an accepter of persons, which is denied, Acts 10? I
believed Teachers and Doctors and Elders, had been the Eyes, Ears and Hands,
and so integrall parts of the visible Church, as Christ is the head of the
catholic church. And this man makes integrall parts adjunctes of the church,
thereby declaring Ministers may be well wanted, and that they are passements ad
been esse, and things of order. Never did Anabaptists speak louder against the
Ordinances of Christ; and Socinians and Arminians are obliged to him. Thirdly,
the believers have right to the Officers, and this right is an essential
property of the Church; then also, because believers have right to the Keys,
the Keys are only an adjunct of the visible Church, which our brethren must
deny. 4. Acts 20. 17. 1 Timothy 3. 15. The Church excluding the Officers is (says
Robinson) called the Church, as the Elders of the Church, and Timothy was to
behave himself well in the Church of God. This is answered; they are first a
mystical Church, not a governing Church. Secondly, a man is called a man
excluding his soul, (if your soul were in my souls stead.) Therefore a man
is a thing living, and a reasonable man without his soul: what vanity is here!
Fifthly, if the Church Covenant be the essential form of the Church, it is as
accider tall to the well being of believers, as Officers are; for they are the
light of the world, the salt of the earth, which is more necessary then a
Church Covenant.

And Robinson says p. 112, 113.
further, Two or three have received Christ, and his power and right to all the
means of grace, and Christ and his power are not divided; also the wife has
immediate right to her husbands person and goods for her use.

Answ. Two or three (yea one believer) and these not entered in Church State,
but believing in Christ, have received Christ and his power in all Christian
privileges due to that state: True; They have received Christ and his power in
all ministerial and Church Priviledges, it is false; nor can our brethren
admit of this by their grounds: for then should they have right in their own
person to preach pastorally, and administrate the Sacraments; if Christ and the
pastoral power to such acts cannot be divided, and if they have as immediate
right to use the keys in pastoral acts as the wife has to the husband and
goods.

Also (says he) Just. p. 1^7*
Of the Churches of the Gentiles, some were converted to God by Apostles,
others by private Christians, Acts 8. 12. and 10. 36, 44, 47, 48. and 11. 19,
20, 21. and 13. 1, 12, 48. and 14. 1, 7. Can we in reason thinks, during the
Apostles absence, that the Churches never assembled together for edification in
praying, prophesying, and other ordinances? were not all they converts, who
desired to be admitted to their fellowship? Had they not use of
excommunication? The Apostles came but occasionally to the Churches, where they
appointed Elders, Acts 14. 25. Why did Paul leave Titus at Crete, save only
that men of gifts might be trained up in prophesying?

Answ. All here said is conjecturall, he cannot give us an instance of a Church
exercising Church Power, and destitute of Officers, only he says, Can we
conceive that in the Apostles absence there was no Church meetings for
edification? But were there no Elders and Officers in the Apostolic Church,
but only Apostles? I think there have been Pastors, and when the Apostles
first left the planted Churches, can we conceive that they left new converted
flocks without Pastors? and if without Officers they met for prophesying, can
we conceive that they wanted the Seals of the Covenant? certainly, Sacraments
without Officers are no rules for us to follow. Secondly, of conversion by
private persons, I purpose to speak hereafter; if they preached, it is not
ordinary, nor a rule to us. Thirdly, at Crete there have been Preachers, but
of government without them I see nothing; since Elders Timothy and Titus are
limited in receiving accusation: against Elders, and are forbidden to lay
hands suddenly on any man; I see not how the people without Officers did this.
It is good, that this Church that they give us, is all builded upon
conjectures, and an unwritten Church is an unwritten tradition. If the Apostles
appointed Elders in the Church for this end, to govern; we gather the
contrary of your collections. Ergo, there was no government in the Churches
before there were governors, for the end could not be existing in Gods wisdom
without the means; that watchmen should go about the walls before the City
be walled, and discipline erected, I cannot conceive: without Officers, the
ordinary disciplinators, the City of God can be no governing City.

It is (says he) strange where multitudes are converted; and that where
neither Apostles nor Officers were present, that there were no Churches here;
it is gross to say. That in the Apostles times nothing was begun but by them.

A. There was conversion of multitudes to the Lord; Ergo, there was a
Church Covenant in stating them all in Church State; you cannot say it your
selves. Secondly, it is not gross, but Apostolic, that all new Acts of
government should take their beginning from the Apostles, as the choosing of
Matthias, Acts 1. the ordaining of Deacons, Acts 6. the preaching to the
Gentiles, Acts 10. had their beginning from the Apostles, who founded and
planted Churches.

3. Quest. Whether or not ordination of Elders may be by the Church of
believers wanting all Elders or Officers.

Here these particulars must be discussed; first, from whence is ordination of
Elders from Elders or from the people. Secondly, if election by the people be
all that is requisite in a lawful calling. Thirdly, the argument from the
calling of our reformers must be discussed.

For the first, observe the following considerations:

First, A succession in the Church is necessary ordinarily; extraordinarily,
and in cases of necessity it may be wanting. Secondly, we deny the popish
succession to be a note of the Church, nor do we in any sort contend for it.
First, because a right succession must be a succession to truth of Doctrine,
not personal or total to the chair and naked office. So T^rtul. de praescrip
c. 32.
Tertullian, and falsehood may succeed to truth, sickness to health, as Naz.
orat. 21. (...).
Nazianzen. Yea, as Occam dial. p. 1. l. 4. c 9. and sect 5. c. 3. etc 28. qut
sidem primitus fundavit catholicam, tot^st date pauperes, simplices ill^crator
and rusticos in aedis^^ationem Eccles. orthodoxae.
Occam says, Laymen and Teachers extraordinarily raised up, may succeed to
heretical Pastors.

Secondly, there is succession to the errors of preceding teachers, either

3 Distinct. It is one thing to receive ordination from a P^^lat^ lawfully and
another thing to receive lawful ordination. The former w^ deny; Ministers
si^ne who receive ordination from a Pr^late, as they sin, who receive
baptism from the Romish Church; yet is the ordination lawful and valid,
because Prelacy, though different in nature from the office of a true Pastor,
is consistent in the same subject with the Pastors office.

4. Distinct. Though election by the people may make a minister in some cases,
yet it is not the essential cause of a called Pastor, as a Rose caused to grow
in winter by art is of that same nature with aR^se produced by nature in
summer, though the manner of production be different. So are they both true
Pastors, those who have no call ba^ the peoples election, and those who have
ordination by Pastors.

5. Distinct. The substance and essence of ordination (as we sh^^ after hear)
consists in the appointing of such for the holy ministry by persons in
office. All the corrupt rites added to this by Papists, take not away the
essence and nature of ordination. For the Greek Church, even this day at Rome,
receives ordination by imposition of hands, and not by the reaching a cup and
a platter, and that with the Popes good will. Whereas the Lati^ Church have far
other Ceremonies following the decree of E^ginius the fourth, and the common
way of Rome, approved by Innocent. 4. ca. de Sacram. non iteran. it is.
Innocentius the third, and yet they grant both ways of ordinations lawful;

Scotus. But since Robins. Inst. sapa p 334.
Robinson grants, that the Baptism of the Romish Church is not to be
repeated, ordination of Pastors is of that same nature, and must stand valid
also.

Hence our first conclusion. In cases of necessity, election by the people
only may stand for ordination, where there be no Pastors at all. This is
proved before by us; Ut supra;
first, because God is not necessarily tied to succession of Pastors. Secondly,
because where men are gifted for the work of the ministry, and there be no
Pastors to be had, the giving of the holy Ghost is a sign of a calling of God,
who is not wanting to his own gracious intention, though ordinary means
fail. And see for this that learned Voetius U^et. disp. causa Papatus. l. 2.
sect 2. c. 20. and c. 21. p. 263, 264, 265.
Nor do we think that we are in this straited, as the Papist Iansenius Apud
Uoetium loc. cit.
in that place says, That we must wait for an immediate calling from Heaven,
as also Robinson Just. sepa.
Robinson says.

2. Conclus. Thence may well be deduced that they are lawful Pastors, and need
not a calling revealed, who, in cases of extraordinary necessity, are only
chosen by the people, and not ordained by Pastors; and that Pastors ordained by
Pastors, as such, are Pastors of the same nature; as Matthias called by the
Church, and Paul immediately called from Heaven, had one and the same office by
nature.

3. Conclus, The established and settled order of calling of Pastors, is by
succession of Pastors to Pastors, and Elders by Elders, 1 Timothy 5. 22. Lay hands
suddenly on no man. 2 Timothy 4. 14. Neglect not the gift which was given to thee
by proph^cie, with the laying on of the hands of the Elders. Secondly, the
practice of the Apostles is our safe rule, because at all ordination of
Churchofficers the Apostles and Pastors were actors and ordainers, as Acts 1.
15, 16. Acts 6. 2. 3. Acts. 14. 23. 1 Cor. 3. 6. Tit. 1. 5. and this Robinson
Just. of sepa. p 327.
Robinson grants, because the charge of all the Churches did lie on the
Apostles. As also before the Law, the people did not ordain the Priest hood,
but God ordained the first borne by succession to be teachers and priests; Genesis
21. 9. Gen 25. 31, 32 Number. 3. 12, ^2 Number. 8, 15, 16
and after he chose the Tribe of Levi, without consent of the people, though
the Princes and heads of Tribes said hands upon them. And also God of sundry
other Tribes raised up Prophets, and did immediately call them, they had only
of the people not the calling, bu^^ ^t the least the silent approbation of the
faithful amongst the people. Christ coming in the flesh chose twelve Apostles
not knowing either the governing Church or the people; at length, when the
Apostles established a Church Government, and a Pastor to a certain flock,
they ordained that the ch^sing of the man should be with consen of the people,
and beg^n this in Ma^thias, then the seven Deacons, then Acts 14. 23. Elders
were chosen by lasting up of the peoples hands. But that persons were ordained
Pastors and sanctified, and set apart for the work of the ministry, by the
authority of the sole multititude, and that without all Officers, we never
read. And the laying on of the hands we see not in the New Testament; we shall
be d^si^ous to be informed of this by our dear brethren, and entreat them in
the fear of the Lord to consider of an unwritten calling of a Ministry.
Thirdly, if ordination of Pastors be laid down in the Apostolic Canons to
Officers, as Officers, then is not this a charge that does agree to the people,
especially wanting Officers. But the former is true; Ergo, so is the latter. I
prove the proposition: What is charged upon Officers as Officers cannot be the
charge of the people, because the people are not Officers. I prove the
assumption, because 2 Timothy 2. 1, 2. To commit to faithful men the things of
the Gospel, which Timothy heard Paul preach, is a charge laid on Timothy in
the very terms, that he is verse. 4. not to entangle himself with the affairs
of this life, but to be separated for preaching the Gospel, from all worldly
employment; as a Soldier sworn to hi^ Captain, can attend no other calling,
verse. 5. and as he is to put other Pastors in mind of these things, and to
charge them that they strite not about words; and as he is to be an approved
workman, dividing the word aright, verse. 14. 15. But these are laid upon
Timothy as a Pastor. So 1 Timothy 5. as he shows the honor and reward due to
Elders, so does he charge Timothy not to hear accusations of Elders, but upon
two or three witnesses testimony, which is the part of Church-Iudges; even as
he is to rebuke sin publicly, that others may fear, verse. 19, 20. So
according to that same office, must imposition of hands be conserred upon
Pastors advisedly, verse. 22. As the Apostle commands all believers to lay
hands suddenly on no man. Also Paul would have said, I left a Church of
believers at Crete to appoint Elders in every City; if it be the Churches part,
even though destitute of Elders to appoint Elders over themselves, but by what
po^er Titus was to rebuke sharply the Cretians, that they may be found in the
says, by that power was he left at Crete to appoint Elders in every City; but
this is an official power, Titus 1. 13. due to Bishops, as a part of their
qualification, verse. 9.

4. Argu. The special reason against ordination of Elders, by Elders only, is
weak; and that is, a succession of Pastors must be granted ever since the
Apostles times, which is (say ourbrethren) Popish. This reason is weak, because
a succession of Elders and Pastors, such as we require, is no more popish then
a succession of visible believers; and visible Churches ordaining Pastors, is
popish: but our brethren maintain a succession of believers and visible
prosessors since the Apostles day. Secondly, we deny the necessity of a
succession perpetual, which papists hold. Thirdly, we maintain only a
succession to the true and Apostolic Doctrine: papists hold a visible
Cathedral succession to the chair of Rome, and titular office of Peter.

4. Quest. Whether or not our brethren do prove that the Church of believers
have power to ordain Pastors?

In answering our brethrens reasons; I first return to our Author; secondly, I
obviate what our brethren say in the answer to Quest. 13.
the Questions sent from old England; and thirdly, shall answer Robinsons
arguments.

Our The way of the Churches of Christ in new England, c. 2. sect. 6.
Author says, Believers have power to lay hands on their Officers, because to
them Christ gave the keys; that is, the ministerial power of binding and
loosing, Matthew. 16. 16, 17, 18. and Acts 1. The voices of the people went as
far as any humane suffrages could go, of an hundred and twenty they chose
two. And Acts 14. 23. The Apostles ordained Elders by the lifting up of the
hands of the people. Acts 6. They are directed to look out and choose seven men
to be Deacons. And the ancient Church did so from Cyprians words, Cyprian
epist. 4. l. 4^.
Vlebs vel maxim potestatem habet, vel dign^s sacerdotes eligendi, vel
indignos recusandi.

Answ. The places Math. 16. and 18. give, to some power ministerial to bind
and loose, open and shue, by preaching the Gospel, and administering the
Sacraments, as to stewards the Keys of an house are given: but this power is
given to Elders only, by evidence of the place, and exposition of all Divines.
2. If the ministerial power and the warrantable exercise thereof, be given to
all; then are all Ministers; for the faculty and exercise does denominate the
subject and agent; but that is false by 1 Cor. 4. 1, 2.

Scripture. 2. That all the hundred and twenty did ordain^ Matthias an Apostle,
Act. 1. is not said, they did nominate and present him. 2. they did choose him.
But authoritative separation for the Office was Christ's and his Apostles work.
3. That women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, v. 14. being there, had voice, and
exercised authority in ordaining an Apostle cannot be orderly. Yea the Apostles
names are se^ down, and these words, V. 23. and they appointed two, are
relative to v. 17. these words, For he was numbered with us the Apostles, and to
these V. 21. Wherefore of these men which have companied with us, etc. and to
these v. 22. must one be ordained to be witness with us of his resurrestion,
and they appointed two, that is, the Apostles; and the rest are set down as
witnesses, v. 14. These continued, that is the Apostles, with the women, and
Mary the mother of Jesus, etc. The women and others were only consenters. 3.
Here is no probation, that only a company of believers wanting Pastors are
ordainers of Matthias to the Apostleship, and this is the question. 4. The
place Act. 14. 23. proves that Elders appoint or ordain Elder. with consent,
or lifting up of the hands of the people, which is our very doctrine. 5. Act.
6* The multitude are directed to choose out seven men, as being best acquainted
with them. Yet if Nicholas, the sect master of the fleshly Nicolaitans was one
of them; it is likely they were not satisfied in conscience of the regeneration
of Nicholas, by hearing his spiritual conference and his gift of praying,
which is your way of trying Church Members. But 2. they look out seven men. 2.
They choose the^. But v. 6. The Apostles prayed, and laid their hands on them
(which we call ordination) and not the multitude. 6. Cyprian give^^ election of
Priests to the multitude, but neither Cyprian, nor any of the Fathers give
ordination to them.

Author Sect. 7. If the people have power to elect a King, they have power to
appoint one is their name to put the crown on his head. Ergo, if believers
elect their Officers they may by themselves or some others lay hands on them
and ordain them.

Ans. The case is not alike, the power of electing a King is natural, for Ants
and Locusts have it, Prove 30 25, 16, 27. Therefore a civil Society may choose
and ordain a King. The power of choosing Officers is (...), a supernatural
gift. And because God gives to people one supernatural gift, it is not
consequent that he should give them another, also beside ordination is another
thing, then coronation of a King. Presbyters in the Word have always performed
ordination. Manuscript.


Neither will it hence follow (says the Author) as some object (a) Way of the
Churches of Christ in new England, chapter 1. sect 2.
that because the Church of believers neither make the Office nor authority of
Pastors, that both are immediately from Christ, and that therefore the
believers may not lay hands upon the Officers; nor does it follow, because they
receive ordination from the Church, that therefore they should execute their
Office in the Churches name; or that they should be more or less diligent at
the Churches appointment, or that the Church of believers have a Lordly power
over them, or that the Elders must receive their commission from the Church, as
an Ambassador does from the Prince who sent him, or that the Church in the
defect of Officers may perform all duties proper to Officers, as to administer
the Sacraments. For 1. most of the objections do strike as much against
imposition of hands by Bishops and Presbyters. 2. Though Officers receive the
application of their office and powerly the Church, yet not from the Church;
and if from the Church, yet not from her by any Lordly power and dominion, but
only ministerially as from instruments under Christ, so that they cannot
choose or ordain whom they please, but only him whom they see the Lord has
fitted and prepared for them; nor can they prescribe limits to his Office, nor
give him his Embassage, but only a charge to look to the Ministry that he
has received of the Lord.

Ans. 1. I know none of ours who use such an Argument, that because a Pasters
or Elders Office is from Christ, that therefore the Church cannot ordain him.
For it should prove that the Presbytery cannot ordain him a Pastor, because
his Office is from Christ and not from the Presbytery. It would prove also,
that because the Office of a Judge is from God, that the free States of a
Kingdom could not ordain one to be their King; or that the King could not
depute Judges under him, because the Office of a King and Judge is from God,
and not from men.

2. If Elders have their Ordination to that heavenly Charge from the people, as
from the first principal and only subject of all ministerial power, I see
not how it does not follow, that Elders are the servants of the Church in that
respect; and that though it does not follow, that they come out in the name of
the Church, but in the name of Christ, whose Ambassadors they are, yet it
proves well that they are inferior to the Church of believers. For 1. though
the power of the Keys given to believers in relation to Christ be ministerial,
yet in relation to the Officers whom the Church sends, it is more then
ministeriail, at lest it is very Lordlike. For as much of this ministerial
power is committed to the Church of possibly twenty or forty believers, as to
the Mistress, Lady, Spouse, and independent Queen, and highest dispencer of
all ministerial power; and the Elders, though Ambassadors of Christ, are but
mere accidents or ornaments of the Church, necessary ad been esse only, and
liable to exauthoration at the Churches pleasure; yea, every way the Officers
in jurisdiction are inferior to the Church of believers, by your grounds, and
not over the people of the Lord. For if the Church of believers, as they are
such, be the most supreme governing Church, then the Officers, as Officers,
have no power of government at all, but only so far as they are believers;
now if they be not believers (as it falls out very often) then have they no
power of the Keys at all, and what they do, they do it merely as the
Churches servants, to whom the Keys are not given marriage-waies, or by right
of redemption in Christ's blood: yea, Officers as they are such, are neither the
Spouse, not redeemed Church, yea nor any part, or members of the redeemed
Church. 2. The Church of believers are the ^od, the Officers means leading to
the end, and ordained to gather the Saints; if therefore, as the end, they
shall authoritatively send Officers, they should call and ordain Officers as
the States of a Kingdom, with more then a power ministerial; Yea with a
Kingly power, for all authority should be both formally and eminently in them,
as all Regal or Aristocraticall power is in the States of a Kingdom, as in the
fountain.

But neither do we bring this argument to prove a simple Dominion of the
Church of believers over the Officers, or a power of regulating, limiting, and
ordering the Embassage of Officers, as King and State lay bands upon their
Ambassadors; but we bring it to prove that this doctrine degradeth the
Officers from all power of government above the believers, and puts them in
a state of ministerial authority under these, above whom Jesus Christ has
placed them, contrary to Ier. 1. 10. Ioh. 10. 35, 36. Romans 12. 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12.
17, 18, 28, 29. Ephesians. 4. 11. 2 Cor. 10. 8. 1 These. 5. 1^. Heb. 13. 17. 1 Tsm.

3. The Author says, believers may not administer the Sacraments in the
defect of Pastors, because that, by appointment of Christ, belongs only to
such as by Office are called to preach the Gospel, Math. 28. 29. which is
indeed well said; but I desire to be satisfied in these. 1. These places Math.
28. 29. Mar. 16. 14, 15. Luke 24. 28. being all one with Math. 16. 17. and Joh.
20. 21, 22, 23. The Keys of the Kingdom are given to Church Officers because
of their Office. So the Text is clear, and so the ancients have taught, as
Tertullian, Irenaeus, Origin, Cyrill. Theophylact. Oecum^nius* Clemens
Alexandrin* Justin Martyr, Chrysostom. August. Hilarious, Ambrose, Basil.
Epiphanius, Jerome, Eusebius, Cyprian, Damascen, Beda, Anselme, Bernard. So our
Divines, Calvin, Luther, Beza, Martyr, Iunius, Bullinger, Gualt^r, Daneus,
Ti^enus, Bucanus, Trelcatius, Piscator, Pareus, Tossanus, Polanus,
Decolampadius, Bucer, Hipperius, Viret, Zuinglius, Fennerus, Whittakerus,
Feildus, Reynoldus, Anto. Wallaeus, Profess. Leydens. Magdeburgersis,
Melanthon, Chemnitius, Hemingius, Aretius. Then the Keys be given to
Church Officers, because they are Officers, and Stewards of the Kingdom. And
you will have the Keys to be given to believers as believers, and as the
Spouse of Christ. Now Elders and believers may be opposed, as believers and no
believers, as the Church of the redeemed, and not the Church of the redeemed,
but the accidents only of that Church; as you teach, and as the Spouse of
Christ and his body, and not the Spouse nor his body. I see not by our
brethrens doctrine that Officers as Officers have any right title or warrant to
the Keys, or to any use of them, seeing they are given to believers as
believers, and as Christ's body and Spouse. 2. The place Matthew. 28. 19. is
against you; for you say, that Pastoral preaching and administration of the
Seals are given only to such as are Preachers by office. Now the converting
of infidels and other unbelievers, to make them fit materials of a visible
Church, is not (as you say) the charge proper to Pastors as Pastors, and by
virtue of their Pastoral charge, as baptizing; by this place is their proper
charge, because Pastors as Pastors convert none at all, nor can they as Pastors
exercise any pastoral acts toward the un-converted; the un-converted by your
way are under no Pastoral charge, but converted by Prophets, not in Office;
Pastors as Pastors exercise all pastoral acts toward these only who are
members of a visible Church, as toward these only who have professed by oath
subjection to their ministry, ad are partakers of the precious faith, and are
the sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty. So you teach. So by this
Text, Pastors as Pastors cannot convert infidels, and we desire a warrant from
Gods Word for the pastoral acts in converting soule^; yea, seeing by this
place persons out of office only do convert souls by your doctrine, with all
reason persons out of place should baptize, for teaching and baptizing here,
and by your own doctrine are of a like extent. See to this, and satisfy us in
this point of such consequence as everteth the ministry of the New Testament,
which we believe our brethren intend not, being so direct Anabaptatisme and
Socinianisme, points that, we know, our dear brethren do not love or affect.

The Author adds, He who said to the Apostles, Whose sins ye retain they
are retained, and whose sins ye remit they are remitted, Joh. 20. 23. He also
said to the Church, Whatsoever ye bi^^ on earth shall be bound in Heaven. Math.
18. 18. Which is a Commission of the same power, and to the same ^ffect; and so
the Apostles and the Churches both received the same power immediately from
Christ: and therefore though the Church presented their Officers chosen by
themselves to receive ordination from the Apostles, (...) now when the Apostles
are ceased, and no other successors left in t^^^ room from whom their officers
might receive ordination, but fr^^ the Presbytery of their own Churches;
where such a Presbytery is yet wanting, and is now to be erected, the Church
has full power to give ordination to them themselves, by the imposition of
their hands.

Answ. If the Reverend Author had framed an Argument here, it should have been
thus: Those who have received immediately from God a Commission of the same
power, and to the same effect, by the Text Math. 18. 18. Which the Apostles of
our Lord received by the Text, Joh. 20. 23. These may do what the Apostles did
in ordaining of Elders, seeing they are the successors of the Apostles, where
there be no Elders.

But the Church of believers received the same Commission, Matthew. 18. 18. which
the Apostle did Joh. 20. 23. and where Edders are wanting in the Church, the
Church of believers is their successors. Erge. etc.

First, the assumption is false; for if the Church receive the same Commission
Math. 28. The Apostles received Joh. 20. and you must add Math. 28. 19. for
the same Commission is given to the Apostles, Math. 28. 19. which is given Joh.
20. 23. But the Disciples received Commission, Ioh. 20. and Math. 28. of
Pastoral binding and loosing, and preaching, by virtue of their Office; and to
administer the Sacraments in their own persons, as you grant: therefore the
Church of believers received commission from Christ (where Presbyters are not)
to preach by virtue of an Office, and administer the Sacraments in their own
persons. Ergo, the Church of believers may, where there is no Presbytery,
preach by verue of an Office, and administer the Sacraments. You will happily
say, there is no such necessity of baptizing as of ordination of Ministers, and
baptizing is incommunicable, because we read not that any in the Apostolic
Church baptized, but Pastors. I answer, there is, in an extraordinary necessity
where there are no Presbyters at all, as little necessity of ordination if
there be Presbyters in other Congregations to ordain* And since you never read
that any in the Apostolic Church ordained Pastors, but Pastors only; why,
but we may have recourse to a Presbytery of other Congregations for ordination,
as well as for baptizing; for it is petitio principii, a begging of the
question, to say that baptizing is proper to Pastors, but ordination is not so.
yea but ordination by precept and practice is never given but to Pastors, and
Elders in consociation 1 Tin. 4 14 1 Timothy 5. 22. 2 Timothy 1. 6. 2 Timothy 2. 2, 3.
Tit. 1. 5. Act. 6. 6. Act. 13. 3 Act. 14 23. 2. There is good reason why
Pastors should be successors of the Apostles in the act of ordaining Pastors;
and you grant, where Pastors and Elders are, they succeed to the Apostles in
the acts of ordination; but that all believers men and women should be the
Apostles successors to ordain Pastors, is a rare and unknown case of
Divinity, for 1 Cor. 12. 29. Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? Yea, not long
ago you said that Act. 1. an hundred and twenty, amongst whom there were
women, had all hand in the ordination of Matthias to be an Apostle; so that
believers by you are made the Apostles successors; and more, yea even
co-ordainers, and joynt-layers on of hands with the Apostles. Yea, if believers
received immediately this same Commission from Christ, Math. 18. which the
Apostles received Ioh. 20. Believers are to ordain Pastors no less, when the
Presbytery and Elders are present, then when they are absent; yea, and rather
then the Apostles, because the Church of believers their patent passed the
Seals first, even before the Lords resurrection. 3. It is good you grant that
ordination and election are different, we will make use of it hereafter.

The Author adds, We willingly also acknowledge, where God Ib. sect. 8.
has furnished a Church with a Presbytery, to them it appertains by
imposition of hands to ordain Elders and Deacons chosen by the Church; but if
the Church want a Presbytery, they want a Warrant to repair to other Churches
to receive imposition of hands to their Elders. 1. Because ordination is a
work of Church power, now as Church has power over another, so no Presbytery
has power over another Church then their own; All the Apostles received alike
power, Ioh. 20. 23. 2 The power of the keys is a liberty purchased by Christ's
blood, Math. 28. 8. Phil. 2. 8, 9 10. Therefore it is unlawful for any Church
to put over that power into the hands of another.

Answ. We desire a warrant from Gods Word, where Elders, where they are
present, are to ordain Elders by imposition of hands, and not believers; for
ordination is a work of the Church; Officers are not the Church, nor are they
parts or members of the Church, but only accidents; the Church has its full
being, the power and use of the Keys given to them by Math. 18. though there
be not a Pastor or Officer among them; and if Christ before his resurrection
gave the Keys to believers as to his Spouse, living body, and such as have
Peter's faith Math. 16. Resolve us, we beseech you brethren, in this, how Christ
can give the Keys after his resurrection, Ioh. 20. 23. to the Apostles as
Pastors, and as no believers, not his Spouse, not his body; for Officers, as
Officers, are not the redeemed of God, nor Christ's Spouse. If you say that
Christ, Ioh. 20. gave the Keys to his Disciples as believers, then he gave the
power of baptizing after his resurrection also, by the parallel place Math. 28.
19. to the Apostles as to believers. Hence 1. Christ has never given the Keys
to Officers as Officers. 2. The place Ioh. 20. is but a renewing of the Keys
given to the Church, Math. 16. and Math. 18. and all believers are sent and
called to be Pastors, as the Father sent Christ, and as Christ sent his
Apostles, as our Lord speaks, John 20. 21. This I think all good men will
abhor, though M. Smith says these words, and that power John 20. 21. was
given to Cleo^has and Mary Magdalen. And by your way, Paul (as I think)
without warrant interdicted women of the use of that power, that Christ
purchased by his blood. 3. There is no warrant of the Word to make good, that
Christ gave the Keys to Officers as Officers, by your way, but only to
Officers as to believers; and therefore believers ought rather to ordain
Pastors then the Officers, though there be Officers to ordain. 3. That Pastors
of other Congregations may not ordain Pastors to Congregations, who have no
Pastors of their own. as they may baptize infants to them also, we see no
reason. Yea, and Church power is not a thing that cannot be communicated to
another Church by your Doctrine, for ye grant members of one Congregation may
receive the Lords Supper in another Congregation, except you deny all communion
of sister Churches, for it is a work of Church power to give the Lords Supper
to any, then if you give that Sacrament to members of another Congregation;
consider if the liberty purchased by Christ's Blood be not communicable to other
Churches.

Thirdly, (says he) if one Church repair to another Church for ordination,
they may submit to another Church for censuring of offenders, now how can
Churches censure these that are not members? Is not this a transgression of the
Royal Law of government? Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18.

Answ. The offense being great, and the offender deserving to be cast out of
all the visible congregations round about, yea and to be bound in Earth and
Heaven, the congregation is to have recourse to all the congregations
consociated, when they are convened in one presbytery; that they, being
convened in their principal members, may all cast him out, because it
concerns them all: as if only one congregation do it, they transgesse that
royal Law, Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari debet. 2. The Author
grants, that the Church presented Vbi sup. sect. 7. c. 2.
their officers chosen by them, to receive ordination from the Apostles; Ergo,
The Church did give a way their liberty of ordination, bought by Christ's blood,
to the Apostles, not as to Apostles, but as to pastors: which is against our
Brethrens Doctrine; for except the Apostles be said to ordain Officers, as
Pastors, and not as Apostles, our Brethren shall find none to be the successors
of Apostles in the power of ordination, but only Believers; so Pastors have no
power at all to ordain Pastors, the contrary whereof our Brethren teach.

Now I come to the Brethrens mind in their Questions. It was objected Quest.
21.
How can it be lawful for mere lay and private men to ordain Elders? they
answer, the persons ordaining are the public assembly, and so cannot, in any
congruity of speech, be called mere Laymen.

I answ. Seeing they have no Church office, they can be nothing, but mere
private men; For the unwarrantable action of ordination makes them not public
Officers. As if a Midwife baptize in the name of the Church, she is not a
mere private person.

2. They say, The Church has power from Christ for the greater, to wit, for
Election; Ergo, she has power to do the less, which is ordination; or
ordination depends upon Election, and it is nothing but the putting of a
person in actual possession of that office, whereunto he had right by Election.

Answ. Ordination, by your own grant, is more then Election, for the Apostles
ordained, Acts 6. and must have done the most, and the multitude elected the
seven Deac^ons, Acts 6 2. Ordination is more then the installing of a person
chosen, it is a supernatural act of the Presbytery separating a man to an holy
calling, election is posterior to it, and is but an appropriation of a called
person his Ministry, to such a particular flock.

3. Say they; Ordination may be performed by the Elders, where there be Elders,
1 Timothy 4. 14. yet it is an act of the whole Church, as Quest. 21.
the whole man sees, but by the Eye.

Answ. Though you say, Pastors in the Churches name baptize, yet does it not
follow; Ergo, where Pastors are not, the Church of believers may baptize.

4. They object, when the Church has no Officers, the prime grave m^n perform
ordination; as Nu^. 8, The Israelites laid on Hands on the Levites, that is,
some prime Man laid on hands.

Answ. Israel wanted not Officers. 2. These prime Men are called the
Congregation; Ergo, there is a representative Church.

5. They object; If B lievers may not ordain, it shall follow either that
Officers may minister without ordination, against the Sripture, 1 Timothy 4. 14.
Heb. 6. 1. or, by virtue of ordination received in another Church, they might
minister. Now if this be, we establish an i^d^l^ble character of Papists, but
if being called to another Church, there be need of a new Election, then there
is need of a new ordination, for that depends upon this; Ergo, then
ordination comes by succession, but we see not what authority ordinary
officers have to ordain Pastors to a Church, whereof themselves are not
members.

Answ. 1. That ordination be wanting, where Ministers are wanting, is
extraordinary, and not against, 1 Timothy 4 14. No more then that one not baptized
for want of a Pastor should yet believe in Christ. 2. We see no indeleble
Character, because a Pastor is always a called Pastor; if the man commit
scandals, the Church may call all his character from him, and turn him into a
mere private man. But to renew ordination, when election to another
congregation is renewed, is to speak ignorantly of ordination and election:
for election makes not the man a Minister, nor gives him a calling, but
appropriateth his Ministry to such a flock. But they speak of Election to a
charge as of marriage, which is not well understood, for by marriage a man is
both made a Husband, and a Husband to this Wife only: by election a Pastor is
not made a Pastor, by ordination he is made a Pastor of the Church Universal,
though he be not made an Universal Pastor. 3. The ordination by succession of
Pastors, where Pastors are, you hold your selves. But a popish personal
succession, we disclaim, as well as you do:

The 5. Objection I omit to another time. The 6. 6. Reas. ib.
Objection is; If there be a magistrate before, the succeeding magistrate
receives keys or (word from the preceding magistrate: but if there be none, he
receives them from the people. So here.

Answ. Christ's calling is not ordered according to the pattern of civil
governments, his kingdom is not of this world. People may both ordain and
elect to a civil office, without consent of the preceding Magistrate. But we
read of no officers ordained by the people, only in an ordinary way.

Ordination (say they) is not of such eminency as is conceived, it is not
mentioned in the Apostles first commission, Mat. 28, 19. Mark 16. 15, 16. The
Apostles accounted preaching and praying principal. So Perkins. on Gala.

Answ. So answer Arminians Apol. Remostran. c. 21. ^. 227 missio seu ordinatio

and so does the Socinian Nicola^d. in d^s^tract. de miss. min. c. 1. ^. 144.

to reform, but this is not to take away the necessity of ordination, by
Pastors.

I come now to answer, what Mr. Robinson does add, to what is said for the
ordination of Pastors by Pastors, and not by single Believers, Mr. Robinson
Robins. Ins^i^. p. 325, 326.
says, the question is, whether succession of Pastors be of such absolute
necessity, as that no Minister can in any case be made but by a Minister, and
if they must be ordained by popes, and prelates.

Answ. But we say that this is no question at all, we affirm ordination of
pastors not to be of that absolute necessity, but in an exigence of necessity
the election of the people, and some other thing, may supply the want of it.
Nor do we think a calling from papists no calling, as we shall hear: before
I proceed this must be discussed.

Q. 5. UUhether Election of the people be essential to the calling of a
Minister.

^. Election we are to consider, to whom it belongs of right. 2. The force
and influence thereof to make a Church Officer; but let these considerations
first be pondered.

1. Consid. Election is made either by a people gracious and able to discern,
or by a people rude and ignorant; the former is valid, Jure and facto, the
latter not so.

2. Consid. Election is either comparative or absolute; when Election is
comparative, though people have nothing possibly positively to say against a
person, yet though they reject him and choose one si^ter, the Election is
reasonable.

3. Consid. Peoples Election is not of a person to the Ministry as a VVi^is
choice of a man to be a Husband, but of a Minister; Election does not make a
Minister.

4. Consid. Election is either to be looked to, quoad jus, or, quoad f^ctum. A
people not yet called externally, cannot elect their own Minister, a Synod or
others of charity ( as Reverend Junius Iunius contra Bellarm. de Cl^r. l. 1. c.
7.
says) may choose for them, though, de facto, and in respect of their case,
they cannot choose their own Pastor.

1. Conclus. The people have Gods right to choose, for so the Acts 15. 22. 1
Cor. 16. 3. 1 Cor. 8. 19. Acts 6. 6. Acts 14. 23.
word prescribes. So Tertul. apol. 39.
Tertullian, Cyprian. l. 1. epist. 4. ad soeli. presbyterum.
Eyprian. Non blandiatur sibi plebs, quasi immunis a contagione delicti esse

to say this custom began in the time of the Nicon Council. It was not a
consuetude Cyprian ep. 17
Qu^d ipsum (inquit Cyprianus) videmus de Divina autoritate descender^;
Ignatius ep, ad Philadelph.
Ignatius, It is your part, as the Church of God to choose the Pastor; (...). So
speaks he to the people of Philadelphia; and so speaks Ambros. ^p 32. quae

Ambrose to Valentinian, Omitto, quia jam ipse populus judicavit, Origin Him.
6. ad c. 8. Levit.
Origin: Requiritur ergo in ordinando sacerd te praesentia populi, etc. and his
reason is Scripture, a pastor must be of good report. And Chrysostom. de
sacerdot. l. 3.
Chrysostom says, all elections of pastors are null, (...), without the
conscience of the people. And the Council of Nice did write this to the
Bishops of Alexandria as Theodoret bist. l. 1. c. 9.
Theodoret says, and the first general council of Constantinople wrote the
same to Daemasus, Ambrose, and others, as Theodoret. bist. l. 5. c. 9.
Theodoret also shows Council. Africanum.
The council of Africa is cited by Cyprian producing Scripture, as Acts 1. 23.

Canons say this, Nicolaus papa c. in nomine d. 23.
so Nicolaus the Pope in his Decrees says, the Clergy and people did choose the
pope, Reliquus clerus and populus Romanus ad consensum nova electionis
pontificis a Cardinalibus factae accedant. So Gelasius pap. ad Phil. and Ser.
epist. did. 62.
Gelasius the pope writes to Philippus and Cernuti^^ Bishops, so Stephanus ad
Romanum Did. 62.
archiepiscopum Rav^^natensem, is cited in the gloss to that purpose; in Jvo
Episcop. Carnatensis ep. 3.
the Epistles of Ivo Bishop of Chartres, we being called, by the will of God,
the Cle^gy and people of such a City, and this Pope Ur^^^ practiced upon Ivo.

2. Conclus. But elections in the ancient Church were not by one single
congregation, but by the Bishops of diverse other Churches. In the Council.
Sardicens. ut ha be^ure. 3. did. 65.
council of Sardis, Si unum tantum in provincia contigerit remanere Episcopum,

convocare debet Episcopos vicinae provinciae and peter^ sibi rectorem. In the
Council. Tolet, 12. can. 6. ut citatur cum long did. 63.
council of Toledo it was ordained, that the Bishop of Toledo might choose in
quibustibee Pr^vinciis, in any provinces about Bishops to be his successors,
salvo privilegio unius^njusqu^ provinciae. Cardinals are forbidden to usurp to
choose a Bishop, if the sea vace in the time of a general Council, this was
enacted in the council of Council, Constan. Sess. 24.
Constance and Council. Basil. Sess. 37.
Basil. The Abbot of Panormo says, it was obtained of the council of Carthage
In c. licet de electione did. 2.
to avoyde dissension, that they should transfer their right to the Cardinals.
So Jac. Ahnain de potest. Eccles.
Almain and Ja. Gerson de potest Eccles.
Gerson prove the equity of this by good reasons. That wicked council of
Trent, laboring to exalt the popes chair, did abrogate these good acts to the
offense of many, as the Author Review of the Council of Trent. l 4. c. 1.
of the review of the council of Trent shows; nor should good men stand for
Leo his abrogation of what the council of Basil did in this kind, as may be
seen in that wicked council of Lateran Council. L^teran.
wherein much other wicked power is given to the pope and his Legates by Julius
III. and Paul the III. and Pius the IIII. and Theodoret. l. 5. c. 23.
Theodoret says, all the Bishops of a Province ought to be at the ordination
of a Bishop. The ordination of the worthy, Ambrose, as he Ambros. Epist. 82.
himself says, was confirmed by all the Bishops of the East and West.
Cornelius Bishop of Rome was confirmed by the Bishops of Africa. More of this
may be seen in Zonaras in Con. Laodic. c. 1. and 5.

Theodoret Council. Carthag. an. 418.
the council of Carthage and Petru^ a Navar. de rest. ablator. l. 2. c. 2.
Petrus a Navarre, who all witness ordination of a Bishop was never done in the
ancient Church by one single Congregation, and these destitute of pastors and
Elders. The learned say, that Gregory the VII. or Hildebrand did first exclude
the people from voycing in elections of pastors. Illiricus says only from the
time of Frederick the XI. about the year, 1300 they were excluded from this
power. And though it were true, that the election of Alexander the III. was
made 400 years before that, by the Cardinals only, without the peoples
consent, the Law and Logic both say; from one fact no Law can be concluded.
Yea the election of Gregory the VII. (says Vasquez 3. (...). 3. disp. 144. c.
5. uum. 55.
Vasquez) was five hundred years before that, and like enough that such a
monster and such a seditious head to the Lords anointed to Henry the IIII, as
this Gregory was, could violate Christ's order. Platin. i^ vit. pontis.
Platina says so; yet Bellarmine, Suarez and others grant, in the Apostles
time it was so; b^^ because it was a positive Law (some say) and others that it
was a Church constitution, not a divine Law, the Pope might change it. Yet the
Jesuit Sanctius Sanctius co^. Acts 14. 22.
in his comment proves it from Scripture, Azorius Instit. moral. par. 2. l. ^.

V^squez and others: because. 1. They forbid only disorder and confusion. 2.
That all the multiude, without exceptionosage, gifts, or sexes, should come,
and speak and voice at the election. For in the council of Antioch Council.
Antioch.
it is expressly forbidden that the multitude should be debarred. And we will
not deny but a pastor may be sent to a Church of Infidels that knows nothing
of Christ, without their knowledge, as Ruffinus Histor. l. 10. c. 9.
Ruffinu^ says, that Frumentius was ordained Bishop to the Indians, they
knowing nothing of it, Indis nihil scientibus neque cogitantibus. Epiphanius
writes to John Bishop of Jerusalem, that he had ordained Paulinianus a
presbyter, the people not consenting. Gregorius ordained Augustine Bishop of
England and sent him to them to teach them, Anglis nescientibus. And Gregorius
II. ordained Bonifacius a Bishop to be sent to Germany, Germanis nihil de ear
cogitantibus. And thus Perkins on Gal. 1. 8.
Perkins, if the Gospel should arise in America, where there were no
Ministers, ordination might be wanting. And why not (say I) election also in
another case, if as Peter Martyr on Judge. c. 4. v. 5
Petrus Martyr says well; a woman may be a Preacher of the Gospel; Yea, and a
Turk (says Zanchius com. in, Ephesians. 5.
Zanchius) converted by reading the New Testament, and converting others, may
baptize them whom he converteth, and be baptized where both ordination and
election should be wanting: and this may answer what Robinson Justification of
separ. p. 338, 139, 340.
Robinson says for ordination by the people.

Nor did the people first begin to have hand in election in Tertulliam
Apologe^. c. 30.
Tertullians time, as Bellarmine says, nor yet that the people might love
their Bishops, nor yet by mere custom.

Conclus. III. It is false our Quest. 20.
Brethren say, that the calling of a Minister consists principally and
essentially in election of the people, for the Apostles were essentially
pastors, yet not one of them, except Matthias was chosen by the people. 2. If,
as our Brethren say, the peoples after acceptance may supply the want of
Election at first, as Jacobs after consent to Leah made her his Wife, yet all
the pastoral acts of Word, Sacraments, and censures going before the after
consent shall be null, because he wants that which most principally and
essentially is required in a calling. And all baptized by him must be
rebaptized. And what if the people shall never assent, and it is ordinary that
hypocrites in hearts will never consent to the Ministry of a gracious pastor,
shall his acts of converting, and baptizing be no pastoral acts, and to the
hypocrites no pastoral acts: and shall all be Infidels, who are baptized by
him? The people are not infallible in their choice, and may refuse a man for a
pastor, whom God has called to be a pastor; election makes not one a pastor,
in foro Dei, then he shall be no pastor whom God has made a Pastor, because
people out of ignorance or prejudice consent not to his Ministry. Nor are we
of Dr. Ames judgment, that the calling of a Minister does essentially consist
in the peoples election; for his external calling consists in the presbyters
separation of a man for such a holy calling, as the Holy Ghost speaks. We
find no Church-calling in all Gods Word of sole election of the people, and
therefore it cannot be the essential form of a right calling. All the
arguments of Doctor Ames prove, that election is necessary to appropriate a
made Minister to such a Congregation, but concludes not the poyn.

Qu. 5. From whence had Luther, Calvin, and our blessed Reformers their calling
to the pastoral charge?

This question there is moved because of our Brethren, who think. 1. If
ordination of pastors by pastors, be so necessary for an ordinary calling to
the Ministry, and if Election of people be not sufficient, though they want
pastors and Elders then Luther and our Reformers had no calling, for they were
called by the Pope and his Clergy, for says Robinson Iustif. p. 119.
Robinson when there be no (...) Church Officers on Earth to give ordination,
we must hold with Arrians, and expect new Apostles to give ordination; neither
can a true, pastor go and seek a calling from a false pastor. Hence observe
carefully the following distinctions, to obviate both papists cavillations and
our Brethrens doubts.

1. Distinct. That is. 1. Properly extraordinary, which is immediately from
God, without any other intervening cause; so Moses his calling, when God spoke
to him out of the Bush to go to Pharaoh and command the letting go of his
people, was extraordinary, for, both the matter of the calling, and the persons
designation to the charge was immediately from God Luthers calling this way was
not extraordinary, because he preached no new Gospel, nor by any immediate
calling from God.

2. That is extraordinary which is contrary to the Law of of nature. Neither
the calling of Luther nor of Hus and Wiccliff was extraordinary; for, that any
enlightened of God and members of the Catholic Church should teach, inform,
o^ help their fellow members being seduced, and led by blind guides, is
agreeable to the Law of nature; but according to our Brethrens grounds Luthers
calling here, was not only extraordinary, but unlawful and contrary to a
Divine Law. For now when Apostles are ceased, Luher had no warrant (if our
Brethren say right) no calling of God, to exercise pastoral acts of preaching,
converting souls to Christ, and baptizing through many visible Churches and
congregations, because that is (say they) Apostolic; and no man now can be a
pastor, but in one fixed congregation whereof he is the elected pastor.

3. That is extraordinary, which is beside a Divine positi^^ Law. So that one
should be chosen a pastor in an Island where there be no Elders nor pastors at
all, and that the people only give a calling, is extraordinary, and so it is
not inconvenient tha^ something extroardinary was in our reformers.

4. That is extraordinary, which is against the ordinary corruptions, wicked
and superstitious forms of an ordinary caling: so, in this sense, Luher and
our reformers calling was extraordinary.

2. Did. A calling immediately from God, and a calling from God, some way
extraordinary, are far different. An immediate calling often requires
miracles to confirm it, especially the matter being new, yet not always; John
Baptists calling was immediate, his Sacrament of Baptism beside the positive
order of Gods worship, yet he wrought no miracles, but an extraordinary
calling may be, where there is an immediate and ordinary revelation of Gods
Will, and requires not miracles at all.

3. Did. Though ordinarily in any horologe the higher wheel should move the
lower, yet it is not against ordinary art, that the hotologe be so made as
inferior wheels may move without the motion of the superior. Though by
ordinary dispensation of Gods standing Law, the Church convened in a Synod
should have turned about Hus, Wicliff, Luther, to regular motions in orthodox
Divinity; yet it was not altogether extraordinary, that these men moved the
higher wheels, and labored to reform them. Cyprian urged Reformation,
Aurelius Bishop of Carthage, Augustine and the African Bishops did the like, the
Bishop of Rome ^epining thereat It is somewhat extraordinary that Reformation
should begin at Scholars, and not at principal Masters.

4. Did. A calling may be expressly and formally corrupt, in respect of the
particular intention of the ordainers, and of the particular Church, ex
intention ordinanris and operantis. Thus Luthers calling to be a Monk was a
corrupt calling, and eatenus, and in that respect he could not give a calling
to others. But that some calling may be implicitly and virtually good and
lawful in respect of the intention of the Catholic Church and ex inte^tione
op^ris and ipsius ordinationis, he was called ^o preach the Word of God.

5. Did. Luthers Oath to preach the Gospel did oblige him as a pastor, this
is his calling according to the substance of his Office, and is valid; but his
Oath to preach the Roman Faith intended by the exacters of the Oath was
eatenus, in so far* unlawful, and did not oblige him. Even a Wife married to a
Turk, and swearing to be a helper to her Husband in promoving the worship of
the Mahomet, or being a papist is engaged in an Oath to promote Romish
Religion; if she be converted to the true Faith of Christ, needs not to be
married de novo, but remains a married Wife; but is not obliged by that
unjust Oath to promove these false Religions, though the marriage Oath,
according to the substance of marriage duties, tieth her.

6. Did. A pastor may, and ought to have a pastoral care of the Catholic
Church, as the hand cares for the whole body, and yet neither Luther nor
Zuinglius are universal pastors, as were the Apostles. For they had usurped no
power of Governing and Teaching all Churches: though, I profess, I see no
inconvenience to say that Luther was extraordinarily called by God, to go to
many Churches, to others then to Wittenberg, where he had one particular
charge, yea even through Germany and the Churches of Saxony, and Zuinglius
through the Helvetian and Western Churches, which yet does not make them
essentially Apostles, because. 1. They were not witnesses of Christ's Death, and
Resurrection, which as a new Doctrine to the World, as Apostles, they behoved
to preach, Acts 1. v. 22. They only revealed the old truth borne down by an
universal Apostasy. 2. Because they were not immediately called, nor gifted
with diverse Tongues. And the like I may say of Athanasius, for men in an
extraordinary apostasy to go somewhat farther then to that which a particular
Church calls them to, is not formally apostolic, yet lawful.

7. A calling to the Ministry is either such as wants the essentialls, as
gifts in any messenger, and the Churches consen^, or these who occupy the room
of the Church, the Church consen^ing, such a Minister is to be reputed for no
Minister. Or. 2. An entry to a calling, or a calling, where diverse of the
Apostles requisites are wanting, may be a valid calling, as if one enter as
Caiphas who entered by favor and money, and contrary to the Law was
High Priest but for a year: ^yet was a true High Priest, and prophesied as the
High Priest.

8. If the Church approve by silence, or countenance the Ministry of a man who
opened the Church door to himself, by a silver key, having given the prelate
a bud. The ordinance of God is conferred upon him, and his calling cease not
to be Gods calling, because of the sins of the instruments both taking and
giving.

9. Though Luther was immediately called by Men An. 1508. by the Church of
Wittenberg as may be seen Tom. 9. Wettenber. p. 104.
in his writings as Gerard Gerard. lo^cem. to. 6 de minister. eccles sect. 8 p.
148.
shows, and the Jesuit Becanus Be^an. in opulc de voc. min N T thil. 48. p.
128.
says, he was called and ordained a Presbyter, and so had power to preach and
administer the Sacraments, yet that hinders not that his calling was ^^t from
the Church, whereof he was a member, that is from the Roman Church, and from
God, and that his calling to cast down Babylon was not from the Church of
Rome: and his gifts being extraordinary. 2. His Spirit heroic and
supernaturally courageous, and so extraordinary. 3. His Faith in his Doctrine
great, that he should so be blessed with success in his Ministry
extraordinary, his calling in these considerations may well be called
extraordinary, though not immediate or apostolic.

10. Then we may well acknowledge a middle calling betwixt an ordinary and
every way immediate calling, and an extraordinary and immediate calling, for
the calling of Luther was neither the one, nor the other, in proper sense, but
a middle betwixt two; and yet not an immediate calling. See Saddeel adversus
articul. Burdegal^uses Art. 5^ p. 502.
Sadaecl and Paraeus com. 1 ad Romans
(...).

11. The question, if such a pastor be called lawfully, is a question of Fact
not a question of Law; as this, if such an one be baptized and there be an
invincible ignorance in a question of Fact which excuses. And therefore we
may hear a gifted pastor taken and supposed by the Church, to have the
Churches calling, though indeed he received no calling from the Church, at his
entry.

1. Conelus. To show that our Church was a visible Church before Luther arose,
and that our Reformers were lawfully called o^ God, and h^ Church, is a
question of Fact: and cannot be proved by the Word of God. Because the Word of
God is not a Chronicle of these who were the true Church and truly called to
the Ministry since the Apostles departed this life. 2. Because these must be
proved by Sense, and the Testimony of humane writtings, who can err.

2. C^nclus. Yet may it be gathered from humane writers, that the visible
Church of Protestants this day, has been since the Apostles days. I mean
the determinate persons may be known by humane reasons and signs; as. 1. If
Orthodox Doctors are known to have lived in all ages since the Apostles it is
likely that there was a visible Church, which approved of these Doctors; and if
we teach that same Doctrine in substance, that these Doctors did, then has our
Church, this determinate Church, been since the Apostles time. But Orthodox
Doctors are known to have lived in all ^ges as men of approved learning and
soundness in the Faith; Ergo, our present Church visible has continued since
the Apostles time. The proposition is probable, for these Fathers would not be
so renowned, if the Church about the^ had not approved their Doctri^. It is
probable (I say) because the writters against them have been suppressed, false
Teachers have beeve spoken of and renowned, and true Prophets ill reported of,
Mat. 5. 11, 12. I prove the assumption; for there lived in the first age, John
the Baptist, the Apostles, and Polycarpus, the Scholar of John (as they say)
and Ignatius. And in the 2. age, Justinius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Ireneus,
Melito Sardensis, Theophilus. In the 3. age Tertullian, Cyprian, Dyonisius,
Alexandrin, Methodi^s, Origin; It is likely they opposed purgatory, prayer for
the dead, relics and the Popes supremacy, which in their seed did arise in
this age. In the 4. age were Eusebius Caesariensis, Basilius, Athanasius,
Magnus Gregorius, Nissenus, Nazian. Macarius, Cyrillus Bishop of Jerusalem,
Arnobius, Lactantius, Ep^phanius, Optatus Melivitanus, Hilarious, Ambrose,
Prudentius, Hieronymus, Ammonius, Ephrem, Faeustinus. I think they opposed the
infallibility of counsels, invocation of Saints, and the monastic life
springing up in this age. In the 5. age were Anastasius, Chrysostom,
Augustine, Alexandrinus, Theodoretus, Leo, Socrates, Vigilianus, Cassianus,
Prosper, Elutherius, Marcus eremita, Marius Victorius. We conceive these
opposed the corrupt Doctrine anent freewill, sin original, justification by
works, men's merits. In the 6. age were Fulgentius, Cassiadorus, Fortunatus,
Olympiodorus, Gregorius Mag^^s, Max^ntius; These opposed the heresies of this
age, as the Doctrine of worshipping Images, Indulgences, Satisfactions,
Crossing, Pilgrimages, Service in an unknowen Tongue, Offerings for the dead,
worshipping of Relics of Saints, necessity absolute of Baptism, the making
the Sacrament a Sacrifice for the dead. In the 7. age being a time of Darkness
very few, Isiodorus, and few others, here the holiest opposed the Popes style
and place of being universal Bishop, and the abominable Sacrifice of the
Mass. In the 8. arose Beda, Paulus Diaconus, Joann, Damascen, a superstitious
Monk, Carolus Magus, Albinus; In this age came in Transubstantiation, the
Sacrament of penance, and confirmation. It was an evil time. In the 9. age
were Rabanus, Haymo, Re^igius, Hinaemarus, Pashasius, then extreme unction,
orders, and marriage were made Sacraments. In the 10. age was Theophylact,
Smaragdus, Giselbertus. In the 11. Anselme, Algerus. In the 12. School
Doctors, such as Peter Cluniarensis, Alexander Alensis, Thomas Aquinas, Scotus,
at length Luther and Melanthon came, but from these we build no infallible
argument to prove our Church to be the true Church.

2. The very visible Church that now is, was in the Waldenses. 1. One of their
own writters Raynerus rerum Bohemic. script. p. 222. 223.

co^tra ^^aldenses c. 1.
Petrus Pilichdorffius says, they arose eight hundereth years after Silvester
in the time of Innocentius the 2. In the City of Walden in the borders of
France one arose, who professed voluntary poverty, and because they were
against preaching of the Gospel, he and his followers were excommunicated, but
he is found a lier by popish writters who lived long before Innocentius the 2.
and make mention of them. The articles of John Hus, says Aneas Sylvius hist.

Gretser denies this, that the Faith of such as are called Calvinists agrees
with the articles of Hus; because he will have them grosser Flaccius in

Flaccius says these Waldenses called Leonistae, their Doctrine was spread,

Voetius, and his reason is good. Ignatius, Ireneus, Justin. Martyr, Cl^m.
Alexandr. Tertullian, Cyprian speak not one syllable of popery or popish
articles; also Lucian, Porphyrius, Tryphe^, Cellus, Sosymus, Symmachus, Julian,
mockers of Reiligon would have spoken against transubstantiation, one body in
many thousand places, worshipping of dead bones, the worshipping of a Tree,
Cross, and dumb images, and bread, a Pope who could not err, and they would
have challenged and examined miracles, and I add if they scoffed at the
Doctrine of these called after Waldensis as the confession bears, then were
the Church of Waldenses (though not under that name) in their time. The Jews
objected against the Fathers Tatian, Theophilus, Athenages, Justin, Tertullian,
Alexand. Cy^rian, Chrysostom, Isiodorus, Hispalensis, Iulianus Po^nerius, They
objected all they could devise against the Christian Faith, but not a word of
points of popery now controversed; Ergo, popery has not been in the World
then, an. 188. In the Time of Victor many opposed victors Tyranny: and as

two witnesses. Siconulphus a Prince desiring to have this Popes blessing, came

We all know there was an English Woman-Pope called Ioanna, betwixt Leo the 4.
and Benedictus the 3. Bellarmine, Baronius, Gretser, Lipsius will have it a
fable. Platina a popish writter is more to be believed then they all, for he
affirms it as truth. A great schism arose in the Church because Benedictus
the 3. was chosen Pope without the Emperors consent. The Emperor did hold the
bridle and lead the Horse of Nicolaus the 1. Grets. in exa. mist. pless. c. 39.
Gretser cannot deny this) he defended and maintained Baldvinus, who was
excommunicated by the Bishops of France, because he ravished Iuditha the
daughter of C^rolus Calvus. He pleaded that there was no reason; but the
decretalls of the popes should be received as the Word of God, but because they
were not written in the books of Church-Canons: for by that reason some books
of the old and New Testament are not to be received as Gods Word ( Grets. Ibid.
Grets.) said, these Epistles were equal with Gods Word, and said, they had,
neither these Epistles, nor the Scriptutes authority from the holy Spirit, but
from the Church. That the church was four hundred years ignorant of the
authority of the Scriptures: that he himself was Jehova eternal, and that
Gratianus had inserted it in his distinct. 96. That he was God. Adrian the 2.

Usser, citing the foresaid Authors) justam a^l^^c causam videre p^ssimus,
quam^brem horum majnum pudere nos debcat; we need not think shame of our
forbearers the Waldenses. Whether did Berengarius fear Leo the 9. his unjust
sentence of excommunication: but contrary to Victor the 3. he did stoutly plead
that the E^ements were a figure or sign of the body and blood of Christ, Ar.
1056. And before Nicol^us the 2. in a Synod at Rome before 113. Bishops, for
the space of seven days he pleaded the same cause. So says Albericus
Albericus cass^^ in Chrom. l. 3. c. 33.
Diacon. Cassinens. and Sig^nius de regm Italic. l. 9. Au. 1059.
Carolus Sig^nius. Yea, and he lest behind him in his age multitudes of his
followers, so as Rome was not able to suppress the visible Church ever since
her Cedar branches did spring up to the Clouds.

And we know that the Faith of the Council of Trent, as pressed by Oath
prescribed by Pius 4. and by the command of Gregorius 13. was not in the World
the 10. age, Ambrosius, Catharinus, Martinus, Isengrenius, Contarenus, the
Sorbonists of Paris, and the Doctors of Venice, in many substantial points
contradicted the Church of Rome: yea Thuand. 3. p. 214.
Thuanus Aut^n. de dom. Archi Spalatens. l. 2. sect. 2. c. 2.
and the Bishop of Spalato teach that after the council of Trent the
Reformation spread through the Christian World. In the 12. and 13. ages, the
Doctrine of the Waldenses, of Wicliffe and Berengarius did grow, but few did
write, (says Voetius disp. ca^. papat. l. 3. sect. 2. p. 634.
Voetius,) in these times because of heavy persecution, multitudes in Germany
Austria, Moravia, Silesia Leiden, Collen, Osenbruge, and many other parts
opposed popery.

Now we say there were multitudes professing the Truth, both of Doctors,
Fathers, and witnesses opposing the Roman Church! and what calling the Church
of Rome gave to our reformers must be measured by the best of the Church
consenting to their c^l^i^g: for we are not to think that all professed
popery, but many of the gu des opposed, many were burdened in (...) and yet out
of weakness durst not profess, because of the (...) ^^ea^nesse. 3. They

3. (...) Luther and Zuinolius had their whole calling from the (...) ye^ think
we not that calling no calling, but that it has that which ^ssentially
constituteth a Ministe. 1. C^j phas entered most c^r^n^^ly to the Priesthood,
by the favor of men, and to be High Priest for one year contrary to the Law,
which ordained the high priest to remain for his lifetime. But as Josephus

Bullinger observe, all was done by the will and lust of men; yet Cajaphas was
the high priest and prophesied, which is a specific act of a called Prophet.
John, Ex. 51. 52. It is said, he prophesied as high priest. 2. The Scribes and
T^aisees set in Moses chair, and are to be heard, Mat. 23 1. In so far as they
teach Gods Truth, and yet their entry to their calling was corrupt, if it be
true that diverse say, that Christ, John 10* calls the Scribes and Pharisees.
Thieves and Robbers, because they came not in by the door, but climbed up
another way, but however there was corruption in the way of their coming to
the chair, for they leavened all other the Ordinances of God, and the high
priest was entered a false way, the rest of the Rulers could not come, but in a
corrupt way. But though Augustine Augustinus contra. advers. leg. and pro. l.
3. c. 4. vencrunt a seipsis, non missi.
and Clem. Alex. Strom. 1. Non missi a Deo.
Clemens Alexa^. expound the place, John 20. of such as want a lawful calling;
but then the place cannot agree with Scribes and Pharisees, which seems to
fight with the course of the Text. But our Interpeters Brentius, bumanarum
traditionum doctores.
Brentius Beza in loc.
B^z^ Rolloc. com. ib.
Rollocus, expound the place of these who preach not Christ soundly, and to be
the door and the foundation, but humane Traditions, and yet had a calling; and
the Text says so much, where v. 9. Salvation is promised to every one who
enters in by Christ the door, now salvation is not promised to a man,
because he has a lawful calling to the Ministry; he may have that and yet
b^e a Child of perdition.

3. We are no where forbidden in Gods Word to hear Teachers sent and called,
but only Wolves in sheep skins, void of all calling, and intruders: for
pastors may be antichristian in the manner of the entry, as Cajaphas. 2. In the
matter of their Doctrine Teaching some of men's Traditions, in place of Gods
Word as Scribes and Pharisees. 3. Yea, and brook an antichristian calling, as
prelates do and have done in Brittain^, and yet their Ministry be valid. For
that the calling of a Minister be valid, and his Ministerial acts not null, it
is sufficient that the governing Church give him a calling, either by
themselves, their express call, their silence, or tacit consen^, or their
approbation communicating with him in his Ministry, or by these to whom the
Church resigned her power, or by these who stand in place of the Church; though
prelates invade the place of the Church: yet because first they themselves be
pastors and have power to teach and Baptize as pastors called of Christ. Mat.
18. 19. 2. Because they stand for the Church the Church approving, or some way
by silence consenting (as in the case of Cajaphas entry to the priesthood)
thereunto. these who are baptized of them, are not rebaptized, and these who
are ordained pastors by them are not reordained, but have a calling to the
Ministry and do validly confer a calling upon others. Yea, many of great
learning think that at the beginning of Reformation thousands being under
popery baptized by Midwives and private persons, were never rebaptized, not
that they think such Baptism valid, but where the Sacrament is wanting, ex
invincibili ignorantia facti, out of an invincible ignorance of a fact, such
that way baptized do indeed want the Lords Seal; but we cannot for that say
that they are no better then Infidells and unbaptized Turks and Jews,
because. 1. Their being borne in the visible Church gives a federall
holiness, as all of Jewish parents had a federall right to circumcision, and
were, eatenus, in so far, separated from the womb. 2. Because their profession
of that Covenant whereof Baptism is a seal, separateth them sufficiently from
Infidells, though they want the seal external. But our Divines esteem, and
that justly, baptism administrated by Women, or such as have no calling, to be
no baptism at all; for which let the Reader see Calvin Inst. l. 4. c. 15.

and our Brethren acknowledge that the Church of Rome has true baptism, for
they retain the essential causes of Baptism, even as the vessels of the
Lords house profaned in Babylon may be carried back to the Temple, but if these
vessels were broken and mingled with brass and iron, and cast in another
mould they could not obtain their former place in the Temple. Baptism is a
vessel profaned in Babell, but not broken; but the ministry and priest hood of
Rome is like the new melted and mingled vessel, and essentially degenerated
from the office of pastorship. But I answer, if baptism be valid in Rome so
are the Ministers baptizers, for if the Ministers and priests be essentially no
Ministers, the baptism administrated by the Romish priests is no Ministry,
and all one as administrated by Midwives and private persons, who therefore
cannot administrate the Sacraments validly in the essential causes, because
they are essentially no Ministers. If therefore Robinson will have the Romish
priesthood essentially no ministry, by that same reason he must say, baptism
administrated by Romish priests i^ no baptism, the contrary whereof he
confesses: otherwise he must say baptism administrated, a non habente
potestatem, even by Women and private Men, is valid, and cannot be but esteemed
lawful in the substance of the act. 2. These have a ministry essentially
entyre who have power under Christ to preach the Gospel and administrate the
Sacraments, Matthew 28. 19. The Romish priests have this, and are called to
this by the Church.

But says Robinson. How can England forsake the Church of Rome, and forsake
the ministry, which is in the Church, as in the subject, especially, seeing
you teach that a true ministry makes essentially a true Church?

I answer, England may well separate from Rome everting the fundamental parts
of Faith, and not separate from Romes baptism, or ministry, in so far, as
they be essentially the ordinances of Christ: and I retort this argument; How
can Separatists separate from both us and Rome, and yet retain the baptism in
both our Church and Rome. 2. A ministry true in the essence may make a Church
true (...), in so far; but because of many other substantial corruptions in
Rome, it is a Church which we ought to forsake.

But says Robinson, Robinson Iustif. p. 316.
Apostates in the 10. Tribes leaving the Church which was radically at
Jerusalem, upon their repentance were readmitted to enter into the Temple, into
which no uncircumcised person might enter, but any of the priests following
Idols, were never readmitted to be priests, though they should repent;
Therefore the ministry and baptism are not alike.

I answer, that the true Church was only at Jerusalem radically, as, you say,
would import that the 10. Tribes revolting from David's house ceased to be a
Church, which is false: Israel though all the Land were in Covenant with God,
had circumcision and the Passover, and so were a true visible Church, even when
they did meet in their Synagogues. The Altar, sacrifices, Temple, are not the
essentialls of a visible Church, they were a Church, and did pray toward the
Temple even in Babylon, and were to profess the True God before the heathen,
Ierem. 10. 11. 2. There be typical reasons to hinder men why they cannot be
capable of the priesthood, that did not exclude them from Church state; but
this hinders not but if the seals administated by a Minister be true seals,
then is the Minister thereof catenus, in so far, a true Minister.

He adds Page 317.
a Minister may leave off to be a Minister, and be justly degraded and
excommunicated, but none ever attempted to unbaptize one who was baptized, nor
can he be unbaptized who is baptized.

Answ. That proves a difference betwixt the ministry and Baptism, which is
not the question; but it proves not this to be false, if Romes baptism be
lawful in its essence, so is Romes ministry.

CHAP. 9. SECT. 9.
Of the addition of Members to the Church.
THE Author says, a Church cannot consist of a fewer number Way of the Church
of Christ in, N. E. Cap. 9. Sect. 9.
then seven, since there must be four of them, a Pastor, Doctor, Elder, and a
Deacon.

Ans. And we contend not for number, but four may be a Church of your making,
and in Church Covenant: for it is a wonder, that you require officers who by
your Doctrine, cannot be parts of the Church, seeing you make them accidents of
the Church, and teach that the Church, in its being and operation, is before
any officers be ordained in it: the accidents of a subject, and a subject make
not multiplication, Peter and his learning and whiteness make not two Peter's.
And therefore seeing three believers may be united in your Church Covenant,
they must be a Church: and seeing these four officers, a Pastor, an Elder, a
Doctor, and a Deacon must be chosen by the Church, yea and ordained also (by
your Doctrine) need they must have their ordination and lawful calling from
three, and so these three must be their Church electing them; and a numerous
congregation, we dislike with you.

Author, These who are to be added, are to make known to the Elders their
desire to be added, that they may be tried, if he be found graceles or
scand^lous, he is not to be presented to the Church; if no exception be against
him, he confesses his Faith publicly, and shows the grace of God to his
soul in drawing him out of the State of sin.

Answ. 1. We read not that three thousand added to the Church at one Sermon,
Acts 2. Nor any other that we read of, were in this manner and order added,
and therefore this way we suspect. 2. You require in one to be added that he be
not graceles and scandalous, to be free from scandals is visible and is
required in a visible Church member, but grace is invisible and can be a note
of a member of the invisible Church, but no ways a note of a member of the
visible Church. The Apostles required it not in Simon Magus.

The Author in the same place proceeds to prove that none can be members of
the visible Church, but such as be regenerated so far as the Church can
discern. Hence our,

1. Quest. Whether the members of the visible Church be only visible saints,
sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty, temples of the holy spirit, etc.

1. Distinct. Any who blamelesly professes Christ is Ecclesiastically, in foro
Ecclesiae, a true and valid member of the Church visible, having
Ecclesiastical power valid for that effect: but, except he be a sincere
Believer, he is not morally and in fo^o Dei, a living member of the invisible
Church.

2. Did. That which is unseene is the form and essence of an invisible
Church, and that which is visible must be the essential form of a visible
Church.

3. Did. The invisible Church Catholic is the principal, prime and native
subject of all the privileges of Christians, the covenan^ premises, titles of
Spouse, bride, redeemed Temple of the holy spirit, etc. And the Church visible
as she is such, is no ways such a subject, the non-consideration whereof we
take to be the ground of many errors, in our reverend brethren in this matter,
which also deceived Papists, as our Divines demonstrate.

4. Did. A seen profession is the ground of members admission to the visible
Church. Hence there is a satisfaction of the conscience of the Church in
admitting of members, either in the judgment of charity, or in the judgment
of verity.

5. Did. There is a satisfaction in the judgment of charity positive, when we
see signs which positively assure us that such an one is regenerate: and there
is a satisfaction negative when we know nothing on the contrary which has a
latitude: for I have a negative satisfaction of the regeneration of some, whose
persons or behavior I know neither by sight nor report. This is not sufficient
for the accepting of a Church Membership, therefore somewhat more is required.

6. Did. There be three ranks of men here considerable. 1. Some professedly
and notoriously flagitious and wicked; little charity may exclude these. 2.
Some professedly sanctified and holy, little charity may accept and welcome
such to the visible Church. 3. Some betwixt these two, of whom we have neither
a certainty full and satisfactory to the conscience, that they are regenerate;
nor have we any plerophory or persuasion, that they are in the State of nature.

7. It is no less sin to sadden the heart of a weak one, and to break the
bruised reed, then out of overplus of strong charity, to give the hand to an
Hypocrite, as a true Churchmember.

8. Materially it is all one not to admit members of such a Church to your
Church, as to separate from such a Church, and to Excommunicate such members:
for it is a negative and authoritative leaving of such to Satan, if it be not a
positive Excommunication.

9. There is a visibility of the Church by writing. 2. By Synods which meet
for consultation, as our Brethren teach. 3. By Martyrdom. 4. The seen
profession of many Churches, and these being without the bounds of a
Congregation, it is not Justice to restrict all visibility to one single
Congregation. 10. Visible security, backslyding, over swaying predominants
tolerated may consist with the Church, membership of a visible Church:

1. Conclus. These two be far different, ( Hic vel in hoc satu est Ecclesia
vera) there or in this company there is a true Church. And this ( Haec est
Ecclesia vera) this determinat company of such persons by name is a true
Church) the former is true, where ever God sets up his Candle, there be
their Church Members of Christ's Body either actually or potentially; for as much
as if their be no converts there at all, yet in respect of Gods Decree which
He begins to execute while as He erecteth a Ministry, certainly there
must be some converted there at last. But as concerning the latter proposition,
none can say certainly, such visible persons by name, John, Paul, Anna, Mary,
etc. Are the true Spouse and redeemed of Christ, because, as Divines answer to
Papists, we believe the Church of Christ rather then see it. Yea, the Spouse of
Christ, as the true Spouse, is all glorious within, Psalm. 45. 13. and that
which essentially constituteth a Spouse of Christ, is not visible, but the
hidden man in the heart, 2 Pet. 3. 4. Neither is there any Union of believers
as believers visible. 2. Faith and true grace are not the essence of a visible
Church, as it is visible, because nothing simply invisible can essentially
constitute that which is visible.

2. Con. The invisible and not the visible Church is the principal, prime, and
only proper subject, with whom the covenant of grace is made, to whom all the
promises do belong, and to whom all Titles, Styles, Properties and privileges
of special note, in the Mediator do belong. If our reverend Brethren would be
pleased to see this, they should forsake their Doctrine of a visible
constituted Church, of separation, of popular government, of independency, of
parochi^ll Churches, which they conceive to be the only visible Churches under
the New Testament. 1. The Church, to whom the covenant, and the promises of the
covenant are made, is an Church, and a seed which shall endure as the days of
Heaven. Psalm. 89. 35 36. and such as can no more fall away from being Gods
people in an eternal covenant with him, then their God can alter what he has
spoken, or lic, Psalm. 89 33, 34, 35. They can no more cease from being in Gods
Favor, or be cast off of God, then the ordinances of Heaven can depart from
before God, then Heaven can be measured above, or the foundations of the Earth
searched out beneath. Jerem. 31. 35. 36, 37. Nor the Mountains and Hills can
be removed out of their places. Esa. 54. 10. Or the World can be destroyed,
with the waters of Noah again: Or then God can retract his O^th and promise.
Heb. 6. 18, 19, 20. But the visible Church of (...) or that congregation or
parish (as our Brethren say) of Rome, Corinth, Colosse, Thessalonica, Philippi,
and the seven Churches of Asia, shall not endure as the days of Heaven, yea
they are all this day under horrible defection of Antichistian Idolatry and
Turcisme and Judaisme: if it be said, the faithful and believing of the
visible Churches at Rome, Corinth, Colosse, etc. could no more fall away, then
the house of Israel and seed of David could cease to be Gods people. I answer,
this is to flee to the invisible Church; but the Professors of these visible
Churches as Professors and in Church State might fall away from the Church
profession. If they say, they cannot fall from the sincerity of a true
profession; now yet they are aside, and flee from the visible Professors, and
Churches visibility agreeing to the Church as visible; to the Churches
sincerity and invisible grace of constancy proper to the invisible Church, and
by this meaning, none are the true visible Church, nor members thereof, but
only such as have profession, and withal sincerity of profession; so
Hypocrites, though never so fairly inchurched, have no power of the Keys, of
censures of excommunication, of admitting of Church members, of Baptizing, etc.
All which is very Anabaptisme, that there is no visible Church on Earth, but a
company of truly, and ( in foro Dei) regenerated and converted persons and the
only redeemed of God; and. 2. Our Divines in vain contend with papists anent
the visible Churches failing on Earth, for most certain it is (except we hold
with Arminians, Socinians and Papists the apostasy of Believers) neither the
catholic Church, nor a particular congregation of sincere Believers can fall
into heresies and lose true and saving Faith. But we hold that there is not a
visible Church consisting of only visible professors never so orthodox, but it
may fall into fundamental heresies, and we give instance, in the sometime
orthodox and visible Church of Rome which has fallen from the sound Faith, and
is become B^bel and a whore and mother of fornications. 3. A Church consisting
of seven professors (which our Brethren in this place say, is a visible Church)
may have four or five, yea six hypocrites in it, and yet the essence of a
visible Church, the nature of a Church State, Church Covenant, the power and
use of the keys is (...) in such a Church of seven: for it is certain,
Professon, (...) uniting themselves together in one Church State, are not led
by an infallible and apostolic Spirit, that they cannot err inconstituting a
visible Church: but if they be fallible and obnoxious to error, then in
erecting a Church of seven, five, six, and by the same reason all the seven may
be ( in foro Dei) in Gods Court, yea and (in an ordinary providence now with
relation to the state of man fallen into sin) often are unbelievers and
unconverted persons, and yet a visible Church performing all Church-acts of a
visible profession. Now if our Brethrens grounds hold good, seven unbelievers
are a company in covenant with God, and can no more fall from the covenant and
grace thereof, then God can lie or alter that which is gone out of his mouth.

2. The Church with whom the covenant is made, and to whom the promises of the
covenant are made, is the Spouse of Christ, his mystical body, the Sons and
Daughters of the Lord God Almighty, a royal priesthood, a chosen generation,
Kings and Priests to God: but this is the invisible Church of elect believers,
not the visible Church of visible professors. Therefore the invisible, and not
the visible Church, is the first subject of all the privileges of Christians,
and all the promises of the covenant. The proposition is not doubted. I prove
the assumption; The visible Church as it is such, is a company of professors of
the truth, and connot be, as it is such, the Spouse of Christ and his Body. 1.
Because then Professors, as Professors, should be Christ's redeemed Body, which
is openly false and against the Word of God: for Romans 9. 6. for they are not
all Israel, which are of Israel. 2. Our Brethrens argument is strong to prove,
that the Church of Elders are not the true Church spoken of in the Word; For,
say they, the true Church is a flock that Christ has Redeemed with his Blood,
Acts 20. 28. The Temple of the living God, 1 Cor. 3. But the Church of Elders
is not a flock of redeemed ones, and Temples of the holy Spirit, but in so far
as they believe, and are elected to glory, and not as a flock of Elders, are
they redeemed: so they say, true Elders, as Elders, are not a part of the true
Church, nor the Church to whom Christ gave the keys, Mat. 16. But the Church
making Peter's confession. So say we, the Church of visible professors, as they
are such, are not the redeemed of Christ, and Temples of the holy Spirit, but
in so far as they are Believers and the elect of God. For if our Brethren say,
the Church, as it is a company of visible Professors, is also essentially the
Church of Redeemed ones, then only the Church of visible Professors, and all
the Church of visible Professors are redeemed of God, but this is absurd and
false. Quod convenit (...) convenit (...). Our Brethren acknowledge there may
be an hundred Believers and Temples of the holy Spirit, who are a flock of
redeemed ones, and yet not be a company of visible Professors. 1. Because they
are not united (say they) covenantwayes into a Church-body. 2. (Say they)
because of weakness and for fear of persecution, men may hide their
profession as many do in the Church of Rome, and yet be the redeemed of God,
and be the seven thousand who have not bowed their knees to Baal; and our
Brethren cannot say, that all the visible Church are the flock redeemed of God,
for then should there be no hypocrites in the visible Church. 3. In this our
Brethren maintain one of the ^^ossest points of the Arminian, Popish and
Socinian Doctrine, even that all visible Professors are chosen to glory,
redeemed of God, and the children of the promise, and that in Gods purpose, the
covenant of grace and the promises of the covenant are made to all and every
one in the visible Church, and that God has an intention that Christ shall die
for all and every one of the visible Church, and that he inteneth to save all
and every one of the visible Church. This I prove, for if the covenant and
promises of the covenant, if the styles of Christ's Body, his Love, his Spouse,
his Sister and D^ve, if the revelation of Christ made not by flesh and blood,
but by Christ's Father the ground of that blessed confession of Peter Mat. 16.
17. For which the keys were given to the visible Church, if I say all these be
proper to the visible Church as visible, and due to her as to the first
principal and prime subject, and not to the chosen redeemed and invisible
Church as such, then the promises of the covenant, and all these styles belong
to the visible Church, and God promises and intends a new heart and a new
spirit to all visible Professors as such, and so he intends redemption in
Christ and salvation, and Christ's Righteousness and Forgiveness of sins to
all the visible Church. But our Brethren do not (I hope) think that Gods
intentions, are castles in the Air, and new Islands beyond the Moon, as if his
intentions could be frustrated, and he could miss the white of the scope he
shoots at; for certainly these to whom the covenant, and promises thereof
belong as to the prime and first subject, these are his covenanted people; now
the orthodox and reformed Church holds, that the covenant and promises are
preached to the whole visible Church, but for the elects sake, and that
howsoever externally, the covenant of grace and promises be promulgated to
every one, and all within the lists of the visible Church; yet they belong in
Gods Intention and gracious purpose only to the Elect of God, and his reseemed
ones, to that invisible Body, Spouse, Sister, whereof Christ alone is Lord,
Head, Husband, and Brother, and the first begotten amongst many Brethren. Hence
let me reason thus. The Church whose gathering together, and whose unity of
Faith, knowledge of the Son of God, and growth of the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ, the Lord intends by giving to them for that end, some
to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Pastors and Teachers, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13.
must be the Church to which all the promises of the covenant and privileges do
belong. But the Lord intends the gathering together, the unity of Faith, the
knowledge of the Son of God and growth of the measure of the stature of Christ
only of the invisible Elected and Redeemed Church, not of the visible
professing or consesing Church, nor does the Lord send Pastors and Teachers
up-on a purpose and intention of gathering the visible Church, and visible
Israel, except you fly to the Tents of Arminians. I conceive these arguments
cannot be answered. If any say, that Christ in giving Prophets, Pastors and
Teachers to his Church intends to save the true visible Church of the chosen
and redeemed, in so far as they are chosen and redeemed, now they who answer
thus, come to our hand and forsake the Doctrine of their visible Church, and
say with us, that the Ministry and the keys are given only upon a purpose on
Gods part to save the invisible Church, and that all these promises of the
covenant, the styles of Christ's Spouse, Sister, Fair one, are not proper to
the visible Church, nor any ground or argument to prove that the keys, the
power of excommunication, ordaining of officers are given to the visible
Church, as to the prime and principal subject.

4. The invisible Church; and not the visible Church as it is such, has right
to the Sacraments, because these who have right to the covenant, have right to
the seals of the covenant; and this is Peter's argument to prove the baptizing
of Infants to be lawful, Acts 2. 38, 39. But only the invisible Church has
right to the covenant. For God says only of, and to the invisible Church. and
not of the visible Church in his gracious purpose, Jerem. 32. 38. And I will be
their God, and they shall be my people, Jer. 31. 33. I will put my Law in their
inward parts, 34. They shall all know me (all within the covenant) I will
forgive their iniquity. Now the visible Church as the visible Church is not
within the covenant, therefore the visible Church as the visible Church, and
being no more but the visible Church, has not right to the Seals of the
covenant, but in so far as they are within the covenant, and in so far as God
is their God, and they his pardoned and sanctified people, as it is, Ierem. 31.
33 34.

5. It is known that our Brethren here join with Papists, for Papists
ignorant of the Doctrine of the visible Church, labor to prove that the
visible Church on Earth, the Ministerial, Teaching and Governing Church,
cannot err, but that she conver^ed in a visible Synod, and met in Christ's
Name, has a promise of an infallible assistance. And by what argumunts do they
prove it? You know here Bellarmine, Pererius, Tolet, Stapleton, Bail^^s,
Suarez. Vasquez, Harding, Gretsirus, Costerus, Turrecremata, Salmoron, Locinus,
Cajetan, and an host of them say, because the Church is builded on a Rock, and
against it the Gates of Hell shall not prevail: because Christ says, I have
prayed to the Father that thy Faith fail thee not: because Christ says, I will
send you the holy Spirit, and he shall lead you into all truth. Now our
Divines say, that the invisible Church of Elect believers cannot fall off the
Rock, and cannot fall from saving Faith, and cannot err by falling into
fundamental heresies, but it follows not; Ergo, the visible ministerial and
Teaching Church, either out of a Synod, or convened in a Synod, have an
infallible and Apostolic Spirit to lead them so, as in their determinations
they cannot err. Just so our brethren take all the places for the privileges,
covenant, promises, styles of Sister, Love, Dove, Spouse, mystical Body of
Christ, etc. Which are proper only to the invisible, redeemed, chosen,
sanctified Church of God: and they give all these to their only visible
ministerial and right constituted Church in the New Testament; and say that
this visible church gathered in a church state, because of the foresaid
privileges and styles, has the supreme and independent power and authority
of the keys, above all Teachers and Pastors whatsoever, and that the right
visible church consists only of a Royal generation, Temples of the Holy
Ghost, a people in covenant with God, taught of God, partakers of the Divine
nature, etc. And that all visible churches that meet not in a material House,
in a visible and conspicious Society, as on visible Mount Zion, and not
consisting of such a covenanted, sanctified, and separated people, are a false
church, false in matter, not an ordinance of Christ, but an Idol, an
antichristian device, a Synagogue of Satan void of the power of the Keys.

6. A church in covenant with God, and the Spouse of Christ, and his mystical
Body, and a church which he redeemed with the Blood of God, Acts 20. 28. Ephesians.
5. 25. 26. Col. 1. 18. 1 Cor. 12. 12. Is a church whereof all the members
without exception are taught of God. Jerem. 31. 34. They shall all know me
(says the Lord) from the least, unto the greatest. Esa. 54. 13. All thy
children shall be taught of the Lord. And therefore they all having heard and
learned of the Father, come to Christ, John 6. 45. and therefore have all the
anointing within them which teaches them all things, 1 John 1. 27. And so they
have all Ears to hear. Yea among such a company, Esai. 35. 9. 10. there is no
Lion, no ravenous beast, but the Redeemed and Ransomed of the Lord. But so it
is that no visible congregation on Earth, that are visible Professors of any
competent number, is such a Church whereof all the members are taught of God,
all ransomed and redeemed, and therefore no visible church, as such is a people
or Church in covenant with God. See Rodger. Catechism part. 2. art. 6. p. 176,
177.
Rodgers Catechism.

3. Conclus. A visible profession of the Truth and Doctrine of godliness, is
that which essentially constituteth a visible church, and every member of the
visible church; only our Brethren and we differ much about the nature of this
profession which is required in members added to the Church. Our Brethren will
have none members of the visible Church, but such as are satisfactory to the
consciences of all the visible church, and give evidences so clear, as the
judgment of discerning men can atraine unto, that they are truly regenerated.
We again do teach, that the scandalously wicked are to be cast out of the
Church by excommunication, and these of approved piety are undoubtedly members
of the visible Church, so these of the middle sort are to be acknowledged
members of the Church, though the Church have not a positive certainty of the
judgment of charity, that they are regenerated, so they be known. 1 To be
Baptized. 2. That they be free of gross scandals. 3. And profess that they be
willing hearers of the Doctrine of the Gospel. Such a profession, as gives
evidences to the positive certainty of the judgment of charity, of sound
conversion, is not required to make and constitute a true visible Church.

1. Argu. Israel entered in covenant with God, Deuteronomy. 29. was a true visible
Church, as our Brethren Teach, because that they conceive to be a
Church Covenant, Deuteronomy. 29, but Churches by that Oath were not such, as to the
satisfaction of Moses, and the whole people their consciences gave positive
certainty of sound conversion. Because v. 4. The Lord (says the Text) has not
given you an heart to perceive, nor eyes to see, nor Ears to hear to this
day, Deuteronomy. 31. 27. for I know thy Rebellion and thy stifneck, behell, while I
am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellions against the Lord. ver.
21. Deuteronomy. 32. v. 5. v. 15, 16, 17. Josh. 24. 23.

2. Argu. Christ would not seven times have said. He that has Ears to hear,
let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches, if he had not supposed
that in these seven Churches, there were blind, obdurate, and carnal hearers,
as there were when, Mat. 13. upon occasion of the like hearers, he utters
these same words in substance. Now Christ would have blamed their ill
discerning in admitting such to be the materials of a visible Church, as he
reproves their other faults in government. Neither could Christ reprove these
Churches, for not exercising the Church Censures against liers, false Apostles,
fleshly Nicolaitans, followers of Balaams wicked Doctrine, Jezebed and other
ill doers and seducers, if these had not been Churchmembers, as our Brethren
teach, how can we conceive, that Christ would call these Churches, who were
false in the matter, or give his presence and communion by walking among the
golden candlestickes, and holding the stars, the Ministry, in his right
hand? And if every one of these Churches were approved to the consciences one
of another, that they positively knew they were all of them, a royal
Priesthood, an holy Generation, all taught of God, all sons and daughters of
the Lord God Almighty, how are there such gross scandals put upon them by
Jesus Christ?

3. Argu. Paul clearly teaches, 1 Cor. 5. That the Church of Corinth convened
had the power of the Lord Jesus amongst them, and was a betrothed Bryde
espoused in a Church covenant, even all of the visible Church as one chaste
Virgin to God, as our Brethren prove from the, 1 Cor. 11. 1, 2, 3. Who had
received the Spirit and the Gospel, their minds being knit thereunto, in the
simplicity of Jesus Christ; now if the matter of this betrothed Church was
such, as our Brethren say, then Christ's Power, and Presence and Spirit, were in
these as the Temples of the Holy Ghost, and these were betrothed to Christ
Jesus, and had received the Spirit and were Saints by calling, were justified,
washen, sanctified, who were incestuous, Fornicators, Drunkards, Railers,
carnal, Schismatics, going to the Law one with another before Infidells,
partakers of the Table of Christ and of devils, deniers of the Resurrection,
to whom the Word was the savor of Death, and the Gospel as it is to these,
whom the God of this world, Satan, has blinded. What can be more repugnant to
the truth and to the Gospel of Christ? It cannot be answered, that these in
Corinth who were hypocrites and walked so contrary to the Gospel were not
members of the Church of Corinth. For only the truly converted were such. I
answer. 1. Then Paul writes not to the visible Church and to all whom he does
rebuke, the contrary whereof is clear. 1 Cor. 2. 11. 2 Cor. 3. 22. 1 Cor. 5.
1. 2. 1 Cor. 6. 1. 2. 3. 1 Cor. 11. 17 18 19, 30. 1 Cor. 15. 12. 1 Cor. 10. 21.
1 Cor. 8. and in many other places.

2. Then the visible church was not betrothed to Christ as a chaste Virgin:
contrary to this our Brethren alleged, 1 Cor. 11. 1 2, 3. 3. Not only is
conversion professedly true in the judgment of charity, but also in the
judgment of verity, essential to a visible church as you teach; and so none
can be a member of the visible church, but he who is a member of the invisible
Church, which is Anabaptisme. 4. Three thousand in one day were added to the
visible church, who could not (as I have proved) all be approved to the
conscience one of another, as true converts, Acts 2. Since amongst them were
Ananias and Saphira, and the time was short. 5. If we are to bear one another
burdens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ, and if grace may be beside many and
great sins, as we see in Asa, in Solomon who remained the children of God,
under many out breakings, if the children of God may be the children of God,
and yet some of them habitually proud, passionate, some of them worldly minded,
some talkative and imprudently rash in zeal, some lustful, some slothful,
some ambiticus, yea and if Simon Magus his profession, though false, was
esteemed sufficient, for to give him baptism, the Seal of the covenant, Acts
8. 9. Then it is not required that all the members of the visible church be
such as positively we know (so far as humane knowledge can reach) that they
are converted, yea if this were true, then special commandments would be
given, that as we are to examine and try our selves, 1 Cor. 11. 28. 2 Cor. 13.
5. And to try officers before they be admitted, 1 Timothy 3. 10. 1 Timothy 5 22. and
to try the spirits of Prophets and their Doctrine, 1 John 4. 1. and, 1 Thessalonians.
5. 21. Acts 17. 13. So would God in his Word give a charge, that we try,
examine and judge carefully one another, and that every man labor to be
satisfied in conscience anent the regeneration one of another. But such
commandments we read not of. 6. If many be brought and called into the
visible church, of purpose both on Gods revealed intention in his Word to
convert them, and on the churches part that they may be converted; Then does
not the church confist of these who are professedly converted, but the former
^^ true; Ergo, so is the latter. The proposition is sure, these whom God
purposes to convert by making them Church Members, they are not Church Members
because they are already converted. I prove the assumption, because. 1. The
contrary doctrine, to wit, that none are under a pastors care till they be
first converted, makes to the eversion of the public Ministry, and
gratifieth Arminians and Socinians, as before I observed, because Faith comes
not by hearing of sent pastors, as Gods ordinance is, Romans 10. 14. but by the
contrary, we ask a warrant from the Testament of Christ, that now since the
Apostles are not in the Earth, private men not sent to preach, should be
ordinary Fishers of men, and gatherers of Christ's church and Kingdom. 2. That
Christ has provided no Pastors nor Teachers to watch over the Elect, yet
remaining in the Kingdom of darkness, and that Christ ascending on high, as a
victorious King has not given Pastors and Teachers by office to bring in his
redeemed flock, which he has bought with his blood, Acts 20. 28. 3. It is
against the nature of the visible Kingdom of Christ which is a d^aw-net and an
offici^^, a workehouse of external calling into Christ, even such as are
serving their honor, buying a Farm; and their gain, buying five yoke of
Oxen; and their lusts, having married a Wife. Luke 14. 16, 17 18. 4. It is
against the nature of the Ministry, and Wisdoms maids, sent out to compel
them to come in. Luke 14. 23. Matthew 22. 4, 5, 6. Prove. 9. 2, 3, 4, 5. who are
yet without.

7. If none can be members while they be first converted. 1. The church visible
is made a church visible without the Ministry of the church. 2. These who are
baptized are not by baptism entered in the visible Church contrary to Gods
Word, 1 Cor. 12. 13. and the sound judgment of all Divines. 3. All these who
are baptized. 2. Who write as Doctors for the defense of the Orthodox Faith. 3.
Who seal the Truth with their sufferings and blood. 4. Who keep communion
with visible Churches, in hearing, partaking of the Word and Seals, as
occasion serves, if they be not professedly and notoriously to the consciences
of a particular parish converted to Christ, are no members of the visible
church.

8. All our Brethrens arguments to prove this Doctrine do only prove the
truly regenerate to be members of the invisible Church, and not of the visible
Church. And if the arguments be naught, the conclusion must be naught and
false.

Quest. 2. Whether or no our Brethren prove by valid aguments, the constitution
of the Church visible to be only of visible Saints, of sanctified washen and
justified persons.

Let us begin with our present Author, and with what the (a) Apology says. We
admit all, even Infidells to the hearing of the Word, 1 Cor. 14. 24* 25. Yet we
receive none as members Way of the Churches of Christ in N. E. Chapter 3. Sect.
^^to our Church, but such as ( according to the judgment of charitable
Christians,) may be conceived to be received of God, unto fellowship with
Christ the head of the Church. Our reasons be. 1. From the near relation
betwixt Christ Jesus and the Church, as also betwixt the Church and other
persons of the Trinity. The Lord Jesus is the head of the Church; even of the
visible Church, and the visible Church is the body of Christ Jesus 1 Cor. 12.
and 27.

Answ. To admit as ordinary hearers of the Word and Church Prayers, is a degree
of admission to Church Communion, and they who are baptized, and ordinarily
hear, and profess a willing mind to communicate with the Church in the holy
things of God, they being not scandalously wicked are to be admitted, yea and
are members of the Church visible. ^. Set the first reason in form it is thus;
These only are to be received as Church members who are conceived to be members
of that body whereof Christ is head. But the promisccous multitude of
professors are not conceived to be such, but only the sanctified in Christ
Jesus are such. Or thus, If Christ be the head of the visible Church, then only
such are to be admitted members of the visible Church, as are conceived to be
members of Christ the head, and not the promiscuous multitude of good and bad.
But the former is true; Ergo, so is the latter. 1. If Christ be the head of the
visible Church as visible, it would seem only these who are conceived Members
of CHRIST, should be admitted Members of the visible body. True and in this
meaning let the Major pass; but if Christ be the head of the visible church
not as it is visible, but as it is a body of believers and invisible, then we
see no reason to yield the connection: Because Christ is the Head of True
Believers, therefore none should be admitted members of the Church, but such as
we conceive are Believers, because they are to be admitted to the visible
Church, who are willing to join themselves are baptized and do profess
Christ to be their Head, though we cannot conceive whether they be sound
believers or not; for a profession is sufficient to make them members of the
visible body, though indeed to be sound Believers, makes them members of
Christ's Body invisible. 2. That Christ is the Head of the visible Church, as
visible, i^ not in all the Word of God, he is the Head of the Church catholic
and invisible, by influence of the Life and Spirit of Christ, Ephesians. 1, 22, 23.
Ephesians. 4. 16. Coloss. 1. 18. and in a large sense may be called the Head of the
church-visible, as visible, in regard of the influence of common graces for the
Ministry; government, and use of the keys: but because of such a degree of
Christ's Head-ship, it follows only that these are to be admitted members
under Christ the Head, whom we conceive to be ^t members of the Church, as it
is a Ministerial and a governing society, and for this there is not required
an union with Christ, as head, according to the influence of the life of
Christ, but only an union with Christ, as head, according to the influence of
common gifts, for the governing a Ministerial Church; in which respect, Christ
may be called the Head of Judas the Traitor, and of some other hypocritical
Professors; and also though the promiscuous multitude, that is a multitude of
profane Atheists and scandalous mockers, be not members of Christ, nor are to
be acknowledged as his members, but to be Excommunicated, yet the promiscuous
multitude of Professors, whereof there be Reprobate and Elect, good and bad,
are to be received and acknowledged as members of Christ's visible body, whereof
he is Head in the latter sense. 2. The Argument proceeds upon the false
ground before observed and discovered, that Christ is Head of the Church and
the Spouse, redeemer and Savior of the visible Church, as it is visible, which
is the Arminian Doctrine of universal grace. 3. If these who are conceived to
be members of Christ the Head and sound Believers are to be admitted, why do
you profess that Brethren of approved piety, and so conceived to be Believers
by you, and consequently members of Christ the Head, cannot be members of your
Church, except they swear to your Church government, which you cannot make
good from Gods Word. Now to refuse communion to these who are known to be
members of Christ's body, and to separate from them is all one, and therefore in
this you separate your selves from Christ's Body.

The Author adds. The visible Church is said to be the habitation of God by
the Spirit, Ephesians. 2. 22. to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit of
God to dwell in them, 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17. To he espoused to Christ as a chaste
Virgin. 2 Cor. 11. and sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty. 2 Cor. 6.
18. And are exhorted to be followers of him as dear children, Ephesians. 5. 1. Now
how can the visible Church be the members of the Body and the Spouse of Christ,
and c. Except they be in charitable discerning ( as indeed the Holy Ghost
discribeth them to be) Saints by calling. 1 Cor. 1. 2. and faithful Brethren,
Gal. 1. 2. and that not only in external profession ( for these are too high
styles for hypocrites) but in some measure of sincerity and truth.

Answ. The argument must be thus. These only we are to admit members of the
visible Church, who in the judgment of charity are conceived to be such as
were the members of the visible Church of Corinth and Ephesus.

But only such as are the habitation of God by his Spirit, and the sons and
daughters of the living God, not only in profession, but in some measure of
truth and sincerity, were the members of the visible Church of Corinth and
Ephesus:

Ergo, such only are we to admit to be members of the visible Church.

Now this argument concludes not what is in question; Ergo, only these are to
be admitted members of the visible Church, whom we conceive to be the Spouse of
Christ, and truly regenerated. Now if our conception be erroneous (as it
cannot be infallible) then we may admit these who are not regenerated, to the
Church Membership, if we conceive them to be regenerated; and so our Brethren
say falsely, that the admitted must be Saints and faithful, not only in
profession, but in some measure of sincerity und truth, for these are members
of the invisible Church who are truly and in a measure of sincerity
regenerated, if our conception be not erroneous: yet it is by accident, that
they are admitted de facto, who are not Saints in truth, for the Church may be
deceived, and receive in for members of the Head Christ, hypocrites and such as
are not the Habitation of God by his Spirit, but of Satan; as is clear in
Ananias and Saphira admitted by the Apostles to Church Fellowship, Acts 5. 1.
2. and in Simon Magus, Acts 8. admitted to the Church and baptized by the
Apostolic Church, who was yet in the Gall of bitterness.

But. 1. The assumption is false, for the Apostle admitted to be members of the
Church visible of Corinth and Ephesus, not only Saints by true profession, but
also carnal men, deniers of the Resurrection, partakers of the Tables of
Devils, and in Ephesus false Apostles and Liers, Revel. 2. 3. But Paul
speaks of Corinth according to the best part: for the Epistle and Doctrine of
the covenant is written and preached for the Elects sake and for Believers;
neither is the covenant of grace made with the Reprobate and Unbelievers, nor
do the promises of the covenant, indeed, and in Gods Intention belong to the
visible Church, though the Word be preached to carnal men for their
conviction. 3 This proposition is false ( these only we are to admit to the
visihle Church, whom we conceive to be Saints, and are in the judgment of
charity persuaded they are such) for the Apostles admit all Professors, even
three thousand at one Sermon in one day, Acts 2. and they could not be
persuaded in the judgment of charity, that they were all Saints. 4. This
argument says, that all the visible Church of Ephesus was a Spouse betrothed
to Christ, and Saints by calling, which the Word of God says not. For were all
the carnal in Corinth betrothed as one chaste Virgin to Christ? were these who
called themselves Apostles in Ephesus and tried by Church censures to be Liers,
Revel. 2. 2, 3. betrothed to Christ as a chaste Virgin? were all the visible
Church the sins and daughters of the Lord God Almighty? and that not only in
profession but in some measure of sincerity and truth? It is true, the styles
given to the Church of Corinth are too high to be given to hypocrites, but
these styles are not given to that Church precisely, as visible and as a
professing Church, as you suppose, but as an visible and true Church of
Believers: for a Church of Believers and a Church of Professors of belief are
very different. Paul writing to the Corinthians writes to a visible Church,
but he does not speak always of them as a visible Church, but as of an
invisible, when he calls them Temples of the Holy Ghost, Saints by calling,
etc. he wrote the Epistles to the incestuous man, whom he commands to cast
out of the Church.

We read (says the Author) Acts 2. 43. that the Lord added to the Church such
as should be saved, and how then shall we add to the Church, such as God
adds not; such as have no show of any spiritual work in them to any
spiritual discerning? Ought not the Lords Stewards to be faithful in Gods
House? And to do nothing therein, but as they see God going before them,
receiving whom he receives, and refusing whom he refuses. So upon this ground
Paul wills the Romans to receive a weak brother, because God has received
him, Romans 14. 1, 2, 3.

Answ. Gods acts of special and gracious providence, are not rules of duties
to us; God adds to the Church as it is invisible and Christ's Body, it
follows not therefore we are to add to the Church visible as visible. Gods
adding is invisible by giving Faith and saving grace to some to profess
sincerely, because we see not Faith nor sincerity, therefore Gods adding cannot
be a rule to our adding. God does add a person falling into an open scandal
to the Church invisible, having given him true Faith, but the Church is not to
add him, but to cut him off, if he be obstinate to the Church, and refuse him,
and so this proves nothing, nor is the place, Romans 14. by any, except your
selves, expounded of a receiving into a Church Communion, as is elsewhere
declared. 2. Where there is no show of saving work of conversion; there you
think the Stewards want God going before to receive, but then except God be
seen to go before to regenerate, the Church Stewards cannot follow to adds
such to the Church; but since that same power that casts out of the Church
holds out of the Church, if any after they be received, shall be found to be
not added of God, because they be not regenerated, yet we are not to cast any
out for non-regeneration, even known, except it break out into scandals, and
then the person is not cast out for non-regeneration, for though he were known
to be regenerated, yet for scandals the Church is obliged to cast him out,
because the scandal leaveneth the whole Church, and. 2. The casting out is a
mean to save the spirit in the day of the Lord. But I prove, none are to be
cast out for non-regeneration, where there be no outbreakings into scandalls.
1. Because, de occultis Ecclesia non judicat, non-Regeneration where it is not
backed with public scandalls is a hidden thing, that the Church can neither
judge nor censure. 2. None are to be cast out but for such a scandal, that if
the party deny, should be proved by two witnesses, as Christ's Law provideth,
Mat. 18. 16. 1 Timothy 5. 19. 3. Only public scandalls which offend many, are to
be censured by the Church, 1 Timothy 5. 20. that others may fear. But
non-regeneration breaking out into no scandalls, can neither be proved by
witnesses, if the party deny, nor is it a seen thing which gives public
scandalls, and therefore is not the object of Church censures. For it is
evident though the Stewards see some not regenerated, and so not added by the
Lord to the Church they are to add these same and cannot cast them out. And
yet God goes before them in adding them to the visible Church, when they
profess the truth. 3. God adds such as should be saved to the visible Church
by baptism, because the adjoining to a visible Church is a way to salvation,
but it follows not that all whom God adds to the visible Church are saved
ones, for then the visible Church should consist only of believers, which only
Anabaptists teach. 4. Whereas he says, The Stewards should be faithful, and
should not add except God add, it seems to infer that either all the people
are Stewards, and so Officers contrary to Gods Word, Ephesians. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 12. 29.
or that only officers admit Church Members, which is against our Brethrens
Doctrine, for they teach, that the whole multitude of believers are only to
add and cast out.

3. If Peter's confession (says the Author) be a Rock on which The Way of the
Churches in N. E. Ibid,
the visible Church ( to which only the Keys are given) is built, then to
receive these who can hold forth no such profession is to build without a
foundation.

Answ. This conclusion is against your selves, no less then against us, except
all and every one whom you admit, be builded upon this Rock; if there be
hypocrites in your Church (as you cannot deny it) then you build without a
foundation. 2. By this, Peter before this confession was an un-churched Pastor
built upon no Church-foundation, 3. By this place is not proved that the keys
are given to the Church of Believers, but to the Ministers, for then against no
parochial Church can the gates of Hell prevail. All the Fathers with good
reason, as Augustine, Chrysostom, Cyrill, Tertullian, Hieronim. Nazianzen,
Cyprian, Ambrose, etc. And our Divines against Papists (whom you side with in
this) deny, that Christ means here of the visible Church, such as Rome or
Corinth, but of the catholic and invisible Church.

4. When (says the Author) Christ says, Mat. 22. 12. Friend, how came thou
here not having thy wedding garment, he does intimate a taxing of these, by
whose connivence he came.

Answ. The contrary is in the Text, v. 9. Go ye therefore to the high ways,
and as many as you find, bid. Here is a charge that ministers invite and call
all, and so the Church is a company of externally called, though few of them be
chosen, as v. 14. and their obedience is commended, v. 10. so these servants
went out into the high ways, and gathered together all, as many as they found
both good and bad. This is a praising rather then a taxing, seeing they are
commanded, without trying or selecting only the regenerated, to call in as many
as they find both good and bad. For as many as you find is as good in sense,
as both good and bad, and the latter does expound the former, and when the Lord
commands them to bring in as many as they find, and they find in the
streets both good and bad, therefore they be commanded to bring in both good
and bad. 2. Yea, the very scope of the parable is contrary to this; the scope
is that many are called externally, and so are the visible Church and that by
Gods special command both here, v. 9. 10. and Luke 14. v. 17. v. 21. v. 24.
and yet few are chosen, and of the invisible Church. And Luke 14. several
times the servants or pastors call all (by the Lord of the feasts commandment)
without exception of regenerated or not regenerated.

5. Christ in the parable imputes it to the sleepines and negligence of the
servants, that tares were sown amongst his wheat, Mat. 13. 35, 38, 39. Ergo,
Pastors are to be blamed that there be scandalous persons in the visible Church.

Answ. This does but strengthren Anabaptists who objected the same An^ibaptist.
in coloquio francola^^ns.
It is a fault that a very popish Doctor Aquinas condemns. Theologia
symbolic^ non est argumentativa. For it is not said, while the servants
sleeped, the envious man did s^w his seed, but while men sleeped, which is
spoken (says Pareus com. ib.
Pareus) according to the manner of men, for otherwise Gods providence can
hinder the growing of tares; and Cajetan com.
Cajetan says, here is not accused the negligence of pastors, and certainly
since as Bullinger com.
Bullinger observes well, Christ when he expounds the parable, passes this
part of it, to teach us (as Calvin com. ib.
Calvin says) not to press every part and tittle of a parable, except we
would be (says Bullinger) Christo argutiores, sharper sighted then Christ, and
therefore the Author alleges that by sleeping of men is understood the
negligence of pastors, but that is beside the Text and is not expounded at all
of Christ, but signifies that men cannot see the hollownesse and falsehood of
Hypocrites, till it break out in their actions, no more then the sleeping
husbandman can see when weeds grow up in his F^elds. And if the Lord here
condemn the sleepiness of Pastors, for suffering scandalcus Professors to be
members of the Church, how does the Lord forbid these servants to pluck up the
tares, but to let them grow till Harvest? for he commands the officers to
cast out of the Church and excommunicate the scandalous persons. Yea certainly,
seeing the Field is the Field of the visible church, it makes for us against
our Brethren, that wicked men are growing in the visible church. It is true
that Barow with the Anabaptists Barow discov. of a false Church.
expound the Field to be the Field of the World, mistaking Christ's Words, v.
41. which indeed signify the Field of the visible Kingdom of Christ, because
the World of all mortal men is not the Lords Field, where he sows his
Wheat, but the visible Church only is such a Field. For seeing the Gospel,
the immortal seed of the regenerate, 1 Pet. 1. 23. is not sown through the
whole World of mortal men, Psalm. 147. 19 20. Mat. 10. 5, 6. Acts 16. 6. but
only in the visible Church, the Field must be Christ's Field, or his World of
Church-Professors. And also by this, their exposition falls, for then it is
the sleepines and sloth of Preachers that wicked men are borne in the World of
mortal men, which is absurd.

We are bidden, 2 Timothy 3. 5. Turn away from such as have a form of godliness,
and have denied the power thereof; Ergo, we cannot join The Author objecteth.
Ib.
in Church communion with them.

Answ. It is clear by this argument, to our Brethren, that one and the same
reason holds for turning away, and separation from all persons and Churches,
which are not inchurched by covenant, and constituted of visibly regenerated
persons, and the not admitting Church Members. So our Brethren by this profess
the lawfulness of separation from all Churches, except from their own. 2. No
marvel then Paul will have Timothy to separate from Apostates and from
Resisters of the truth, v. 8. and from proud boasters, blasp^emers, Traitors.
For such are to be excommunicated, as 1 Timothy 6. 3. 5. At l^quitur Paulus (says
Parkerus de polit l. 1. 6. 14. p. 41.
Parkerus) de fundamentali corruptione istius Doctrinae, qu^ est secundum
pi^tatem: but Paul here forbids to exhort the proud and malicious
blasphemers and resisters of the Truth, and not to wait upon them any longer,
whereas otherwise he had said in the end of the preceding Chapter, 24. 25. 26.
Others, who are detained in the snare of Satan, must be waited on, and
instructed with meekness, if God will give them Repentance; Ergo, Tim thy was
as a Pastor to instruct unconverted persons, and to join in communion with
them, but as for desperate enemies and blasphemers, he was not to wait on
them, nor to exhort them with meekness. And if this Text prove any thing it
will conclude against our Brethren, that such as deny the power of godliness,
should not be hearers of the Word, and far less (as our Breathren reason)
members of the visible Church.

Can any (says the Author) judge such persons fit materials for the
constituting and edifying of a Church, who are more fit for The Author ibid.
the ruin and destruction of the Church, such as leave their first love (as
all hypocrites will at length do) they procure the removal of the candlestick.

Answ. The argument must be thus formed. All these whom God intends shall
edify and not ruin the Church, are to be only members of the visible Church:
but all known hypocrites are such; Ergo. The proposition is false, for if we
speak of Gods secret Intention and his decreeing Will; It is not a rule for
the Church to square and to regulate them in the choysing or refusing
Church Members, because God intends in his decreeing will, that many
hypocrites, such as Judas and D^mas, shall be Church Members, and let our
Brethren judge if they be fit materials to edify the Church. If we speak of
Gods revealed will, the proposition also is false; for by our Brethrens
Doctrine, it is Gods revealed will that the Church receive as Church Members
latent hypocrites, such as Simon Magus, Acts 8. who are conceived to be
regenerated, as the church, Acts 8. conceived Simon Magus to be a sound
Believer, as our Brethren say, and yet latent hypocrites, are no less unfit
materials to build the Church, then known hypocrites. 2. We do not think
that hypocrites fallen from their first love, and by scandalous living
declaring themselves to be such should be kept in the Church. But so the
Author alleges, Revel. 2. That the Church of Ephesus falling from her first
love, must be a false constituted Church, in which there were members fitter
to ruin, then to edify the Church. And yet certain it is, Paul, Ephesians. 1. and
Christ, Rev^l. 2. acknowledges the Church of Ephesus to be a true visible
Church.

We pass (says the Author) the types of the Old Testament, which yet are not
without their due weight. Rough stones were not Ibid.
laid in the building of Salomons Temple till they were hewn and prepared
before, 1 King. 6. 7. and behold a greater then Salomen is h^re, the attendance
of the porteres suffering none to enter into the Temple who were unclean (2 Chronicles. 23. 19.) does evidently type forth the watchfulness of the officers of
Christ's Church, to suffer none unclean in estate or in this course of life, to
enter into the fellowship of the Church, which ought to be a communion of
Saints. Their apology says A^olog. c. 9.
though all Israel were admitted to the fellowship of the Ordinances
administrated in the synagegne, yet none unclean were admitted into the
Temple; for Revel. 21. without are dogs, etc. So Master Can and Robinson press
Can. necessit. of separat c. 4. sect. 3. p. 175.
this place.

Answ. In this Type many things are loose and doubtful. 1. We desire a warrant
from the Word, that the Temple was a Type of a visible Congregation, and that
all must be as really holy before they enter into a visible congregation, as
they behoved to be Typically holy, who entered into the Temple of Jerusalem.
The Temple is a Type of Christ's Body, John 2. and of the Church of the New
Testament invisible, which must consist of sanctified ones, but how it is a
Type of the visible Church we see not. For the Lords spiritual building
whereof the Cornerstone and the foundation is Christ* is the Church invisible
built by Faith as lively Stones upon Christ, 1 Pet: 2. 7. Unto you therefore
which believe he is precious, v. 5. ye also as living Stones are built up a
spiritual House. opposite to the disobedient, v. 7. who stumble at the Word,
v. 8. 1 Cor. 3. 9. ye are Gods building, Ephesians. 2. 20, 21, 22. Expressly the
building are these who are built on the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles,
and grow up into an holy Temple in Christ, and are the habitation of God
through his Spirit. This cannot agree to a visible Church, the members whereof
may be (as our Brethren teach from Revel. 2.) Hypocrites who fall from their
first love. Yea also the laying on of stones on the bulding is not the act of
inchurching, or of union to a Church, as it must be, if the comparison prove
the point, but the joining of the stones to the building is the union of these
stones by Faith to Christ, the chief corner stone, as is expounded, 1 Pet. 2.
To whom coming as to a living stone, v. 5. ye also as liveing stones are
built, etc. Yea, and Peter does not build this comfortable Doctrine all upon
the comforts of a Church State in a single congregation; for many of these to
whom he writ, were dispersed and persecuted through Pontus, Asia, and
Cappadocia, etc. And might have, and had an Union with Christ by Faith without
a Church Union in a Parish. 2. Though in this Type were signified a moral
obligation, that all before they be inchurched in a visible Congregation,
should be converted, how is it proved that the Church should receive none to a
visible Congregation till they be converted? for these are far different.
All should be converted, but there is no new Law commanding the Church to
receive none into her fellowship, but the converted. 3. The hewers of stones or
builders of the Temple, must Typifie Pastors in Office, dressing stones for the
spiritual building, our Brethren make them to Typifie private Christians out
of Office, and deny that any Pastors as Pastors do fit and prepare stones to
be laid on the spiritual building. Also none laid stones on that Temple save
only builders by Office, but by our Brethrens Doctrine, only Pastors do not
convert Souls. There were no Stones at all in the Temple of Jerusalem, but
choice and well squared stones, are no members of the visible Church but the
chosen of God?

3. If the Porters typifie the Ministers of visible Churches, first only
Porters hold out the unclean; Ergo, only Pastors should hold out the
scandalous, but you admit the whole Church with equal authority to take in, or
refuse Church Members. 2. If the Temple be a Type of the visible Church, then
no profane person, nor uncircumcised in heart should meet with the visible
Church to hear the Word, for hearing of the word prophanes the holy things of
God. This you cannot say, for infidels may be, as you say, fellow-partners with
the Church, in hearing the word. 3. Robinson holds Robinson (...) ^6.
that Abraham's seed, and so all the Jews were to separate themselves from the
world, that they might be a visible Church to God, but we read not that the
porters were to hold out any wicked person. Yea Jer. 7. professedly they came
to the Temple of the Lord who were thieves, adulterers, and wicked persons. And
so by that neither are the porters of the visible Churches of the New Testament
to hold out unconverted persons because they are unconverted.

Lastly, the place, Revel. 22. 15. For without are dogs, etc. is foully abused
when it is applied to the visible Church, where there may be, and ordinarily
are dogs; yea and liers, Revel. 2. 2. It is true that our divines say, that
it is one and the same church which is both visible and invisible, and that
visibility is an accident of the church, but they then speak of the Catholic
visible Church, but if we speak of a particular visible Church in this, or that
place, all in such a Church as they exist, are either holy or profane, but
neither is holiness, nor prophanes essential to a church visible, as visible.
idolaters, v. 14. Napper, Pareus, Marlorat, expounds it of the Kingdom of
glory, for it is that Kingdom spoken of, Rev. 21. 27. but within that Kingdom
cannot enter any thing that defiles, neither what soever works abomination
or makes a lie, but they which are written in the Lambs book of life, But it
is against all reason and the Lords Word that in the visible Church is nothing
that defiles, that is no sin, but only those who are written in the Lambs
book of life. This is the very doctrine of Anabaptists though we know our dear
brethren hate that Sect, and their Doctrine.

Robinson. The purest Church on Earth may consist of good and bad in Gods Eye,
but the question is about the true and natural members, whereof the Church is
orderly gathered, but as it were fond Philosophy, in the description of Wives
and Children, to make Rebellion a natural property of a child, and Whoredom
of a Wife, so it is as profane Divinity to make ungodly persons the true matter
of the Church, and profaneness a property of the same, because many seeming
Saints creep in.

Answ. If the holiest Church visible on Earth consist of good and bad, before
God, then to be partakers of the Divine nature, Temples of the holy Ghost,
Saints by calling, is not of the essence of a visible Church, nor is it
essential to make one a member of the visible Church, that he be converted. It
is sufficient that he be a professor of the Faith. And it is a poor comparison
to say, that prophannesse cannot be put in the description of a visible Church,
for in the essence of a visible Church as visible, we neither include Holiness
nor Propanenesse, but only a visible company professing the Faith of Christ and
called by the Ministry of the Word, whether they be Believers or Unbelievers
it is all one, neither of the two belongs to the essence of a visible church:
a visible Church is saved in the number of forty, all being converted, or in
40. being all unconverted, so they be externally called by the Ministry of the
Gospel and prosesse the same. And it is as foolish to make holiness the
essence of a child, as to make it of a visible Church, and as vain to make
chastity the essence of a married Wife; for this is not our philosophy, but a
conceit of Mr. Robinson falsely imputed to us.

Robinson. Ibid. 97.
Robinson. All the Churches that ever the Lord planted consisted of good only,
as the Church of the Angels in Heaven and of mankind in Paradise. God has
also these same ends in creating and restoring his Churches, and if it were the
Will of God that persons notoriously wicked should be admitted into the Church,
then should God directly cross himself and his own ends, and should receive
into the visible covenant of grace, such as were out of the visible estate of
grace, and should plant such in his Church for the glory of his Name, as served
for no other use, then to cause his Name to be blasphemed.

Answ. This argument proves that the visible Church is not a visible Church,
except it consist of only holy and gracious persons, without any mixture; and
so not only holiness in profession, but holiness real and before God is
required essentially to a visible Church. Then Pastors, Doctors and Professors,
binding and loosing, clave non errante, are not a visible Church. Yea, this is
down right Anabaptisme that no visible Churches are on Earth, but such as
consist of real Saints only. 2. It is most ignorantly reasoned, that God in
creating Man and Angels good, did not intend that they should fall by his
permission, but that they should continue holy and then God was frustrated of
his end, as Arminians and Socinians Teach. So says Arm. Antip. p. 60.

Socinus, that God intends and purposes many things which never come to
pass. 2. His Decrees fail and are changed. 3. Men may make Gods Decrees of
election fast and sure, or loose and unsure, as they please. 3. Here is much
ignorance that God intends nothing that may be against the glory of obedience
due to him, as Lawgiver; as if sinners and hypocrites being in the Church
because they are dishonorable to God, should cross Gods end, and purpose: so
Tertullian Tertullian contra Marcionem. O ca^es etc. Si Deus bonus and
praescius futuri and potens, cur hominem possus est lahi?
brings in some whom he calls dogs, thus reasoning against providence,
which suffers sin to be in the World so contrary to his Will and goodness:
And who denies but Christ commanded Judas to preach, and that the Apostles
according to Gods Will and Cammandement received Ananias, Saphira, Simon Magus
in the visible Church by baptizing them (for I hope the Apostles sinned not
against Gods revealed Will in admitting them to the visible Church.) And shall
we say that God directly in that crosses himself and his own ends, because
God gathered hypocrites into his Churcch, and yet they dishonor and blaspheme
the Name of God? Whiles Robinson says, Gods maine end in gathering a visible
Church is, that they being separated Robins. p. 98.
from the World, may glorify his Name, he speaks gross Arminianisme, that
God fails in his ends. Lastly, he says that God cannot will that persons
notoriously wicked should be in his visible Church, for then he should cross
himself and his own ends advert ( notoriously) is vainly added, seeing we
teach that notoriously wicked ought to be cast out of the visible Church; as
also if he shall will wicked persons, let alone notoriously wicked, or latent
hypocrites to be in the Church, yea or in this visible World, he should by this
Arminian argument cross himself and his own ends? Do you believe with
Arminians that Gods end is, that Angels and men should have stood in
obedience, and that a Redeemer should never come to save sinners? And that
blasphemy and sin is against Gods purpose and intended end, and that sin
crosses him? but when all is done it is his intention and revealed will that
hypocrites be invited to the visible and preached covenant, and yet he knows
that they are out of the visible, yea and invisible state of grace.

Robinson p. 98.
Robinson. In planting the first Church in the seed of the woman, there were
only Saints without any mixture, now all Churches are of one nature and
essential constitution, and the first is the rule of the rest.

Answ. Though God planted Adam and Eve two restored persons, to be the first
repenting Church; from Gods fact you cannot conclude a visible Church gathered
by men, should be void of all mixture, so as it is no visible Church; if it be
a mixed company of good and bad, this is contrary to his own commandment,
Mat. 22 9. Go and call as many as you find. 2. Gods acts are not rules of
moral duties, his Word and Commandment does regulate us, not his Works. God
hardens Pharaos heart, should Pharao harden for that his own heart? God
forbid.

Robinson. Cajan that evil on was broken off, and cast out of the Church, and
by Moses it is imputed for sin, that the sons of God ^id.
married with the daughters of men; Ergo, it is far more unlawful to contract
with the wicked in a religious covenant of the communion of Saints.

Answ. We grant such as Cain are to be excommunicated, but what then? Ergo,
none can be members of a visible Congregation but such as Abel, we love not
such consequences, a Though God forbade his people to marry with the
Canaanites, yet he forbade not that the Godly and ungodly should come to the
Temple together, and that Noah and cursed Cham should be in one Arc together.
3. Though it be a sin that the wicked should mix themselves with the godly
and come unto the Kings supper without the wedding garment, yet that is not the
question, but if the pastors inviting all to come to the supper do sin, and 2.
If the Church be not a true visible Church, though it consist of good and bad.

Robinson. Circumcision is a seal of the righteousness of Faith, Page 98.
Genesis 17. 10. Romans 4. 11. Now to affirm that the Lord will seal up with the
visible seal of Faith any visibly unrighteous and faithless person, were,
that God should profane his own Ordinance.

Answ. God does by this argument profane his own seal, when a visibly wicked
person is sealed with the seal, as when one visibly unrighteous is sealed, for
the latent hypocrite profaneth the seal of Righteousness, as the open and
visibly unrighteous and faithless person does. Yet it is Gods command that the
latent hypocrite have the seals of Righteousness, since the Church conceives
him to be a sound professor; Ergo, by your Doctrine God commands to profane
his own seals, but this is the wicked reasoning of Arminians, and Socinians.
So Arminians against Perkins, Corvinus against Molin^us, the Arminians at the
synod of Dort would prove an universal grace accompanying the Word and
Sacraments, and they say that Sacraments do not seal remission of sins,
redemption in Christ, and that they be empty and toome ordinances yea and
mocking signs, except all who receive the seals, both elect and repro^ate be
redeemed in Christ, and have grace to believe. But the truth is, God does not
profane his own seals, because he commands that they be received with
Faith: and let us see where any male child, reprobate or elect, borne amongst
the Jews, but he is by Gods Commandment to be circumcised, yet that seal was
an empty ordinance to thousands in Israel. 3. Nor is the seal, a seal of
righteousness, actu secundo, sed actu primo it is a seal of righteousness,
as the Word of God is the power of God to Salvation, not to all, nor of it
self, but by the efficacious grace of God, to every one that believes.

desolation of Sion, did not by the coactive Laws of men Robinson Justif. of

perfect his good Work begun in them, as became him to judge of them all, being
all partakers of the grace of God with him in the confirmation of the Gospel,
and after whom all he longed from the 1 These. 1. 2, 3. and 2 Ep. 2, 3.
very heart root in Christ, and for all whom he gave thanks, always making
mention of them in his prayers, without ceasing remembering their effectual
Faith, diligent love, and patient hope in the Lord Jesus, which did grow in
every one of them.

Answ. Here is much Scripture abused to no good use; 1. that coactive Laws of
Princes be the only way of inchurching people, we never taught; but of this
hereafter. 2. He calls the Kingdom of God which is a draw-net of good and
bad Mat. 13. 47. 48.
a called company invited to the Supper of the Gospel, whereof many are
called, but few are chosen. Mat. 22. 9. 14
which is the field where grow Wheat and Tares Mat. 13. 36, 37, 38.
the Barne-floore wherein is Corn and Chafe. Mat. 3. 12.
He calls (I say) these men good and bad shuffled together in a new monster
or Chimaera. Sin is a monster, but that it should be in the world is not
without the decree of efficacious providence, except we turn Epicures with
Arminians. 3. That all and every one baptized by John Baptist justified God,
and were true converts is more charity, then the verity of the Text Luke 7. can
warrant. 4. And that the visible Church consists only of men chosen out of
the World, as he spoke from Ioh. 15. is a plain contradiction to that ( many
are called, but few chosen out of the World) and serves much for Huberians,
who will have all the visible Church chosen, and for Arminians who make all in
Gods intention separated from the World, and so make election to life eternal,
as universal in the visible Church as the preached Gospel. 5. It is an adding
to the Text, Acts 2. That the visible Church ( all of them) and you say did
communicate in all things with singleness of heart, and were to be saved. For
we have not so much charity to bestow on An^nias, Saphira, and Simon Magus, who
were added to the Church visible: but why call you this the Testimony that the
Holy Ghost gives of all them? where did you read or dream this? The Holy
Ghosts Testimony is true, and what Divinty is it, that all added to the visible
Church shall be saved? deem you with Origin and some others that none are
eternally d^mned? 8. And you say of the visible Church, Acts, 20. 28. All of
them were redeemed by the Blood of God. If Luke had said so, I could have
believed it, but your saying is groundles. All whom they are commanded to
feed, and all who were to be devoured by grievous Wolves, and all the drawn
away Disciples of false Teachers, 29. 30. Are all these redeemed by the Blood
of God? Th^^ Church is an Arminian Chimaera: that all to whom the Gospel is
preached by Feeders and Pastors, must be obliged to believe that Christ by his
Blood redeemed all and every one of them, is Arminianisme. Corvinus contra.

Ostorodius will thank you, for they hold that Christ gave his Blood for all

life for all the World, and especially for the visible Church. 7. That the
Apostle gave thanks to God, for the sound faith of all who professed the
Gosspell at Rome, and were persuaded that God would perfect the work of
salvation in all and every one of the Philippians, is a wicked dream, that
they were all partakers of the grace of the Gospel, and that all the
Thessalonians, without exception had effectual faith, diligent love, and
patient hope. All this is said, without ground of Gods Word: and contrary to
the Word. Were there none, Romans 6. Servants of sin? None who walked after the
flesh? Romans 8 So Romans 14. and Phil. 3. 2. 18. Phil. 2. 21. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 2. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 8 9, 10. None in Philippi whose God was their belly? none who minded

Robinson. ib. p. 104.
Robinson; The Jews were forbidden by God, under the Law to sow their Field
with diverse seeds, and will he sow his own Field with Wheat and Tares? and
Page 103.
the Lords Field is sown with good seed, Mat 13, 24 27, 28. His Vine Noble
Jer. 2. 21.
and all the seed true, his Church Saints and beloved of God Romans 1. 7.
but through the malice of Satan, and negligence of such as keep the field
adulterate seed and abominable persons may be.

Answ. God who is above a law forbids the Father to kill the son, yet may he
command Abraham to kill his son, in positive Laws, such as sowing of seeds,
Gods practice is not a Law to us; I remember Jesuits, especially Suarez,
Didac. Ruiz Molina, Laessius, Lod. Meratius Hiero. Fasolus and their Disciples,
the Arminians, labor to prove that God cannot predeterminate the will of man
to the positive acts that are in sin: For then he should be the author and
cause of sin which he forbids us to do, and he would not do himself, say
they, that which he forbids us. Which is but in the general a weak answer,
for it follows not hence, that he is the author of the malice, because he
praedeterminates the will to the positive act of sinning. For though God in his
working Providence permit wicked men to be in the Church (as you cannot deny
his providence here) yet does it not follow, that he sows wicked men in the
Church. Nor do we say, that it is the Lords appoving and revealed will that
hypocrites should join with his friends at the marriage supper of the Gospel,
they wanting their wedding garment. It is hypocrites sin that they join
themselves to the Church, they being heart Enemies to the truth. And in this
respect God sows them not in the Church. But the question is if the Church
and Pastors sin in receiving such into the bosom of the Church, because they
see not, in conscience, that they are regenerated: That we deny, yea the
servants bid all come whom they find. Mat. 22. 9. and that by the commandment
of God. And in this respect God does not plant his visible Church a noble Vine,
and a Field sown with good seed, yea it is his revealed Will that the Church
and the Servants of God invite all to come to Wisdoms banquet, Prove. 9. 2. 3.
and so all the called externally are not the choice Vines. This you are to
prove, that the visible Church in all its members, or essentially as it is a
visible Church is a choice Vine, and an holy seed. Nor is it the Pastors
negligence that Tares grow in the Lords Field (though it be Satan's malice) yea
the Pastors here are to invite all to come in, and to call externally all to
come to Christ. That they who are invited give not obedience is their own
wickedness, but neither the Churches, nor the Pastors sin.

(a) Robinson. There be amongst you hundreds and thousands (b) Robinson.
Justis. 212.
partakers of the life of God in respect of your persons, but in respect of
your Church Communion, and your Ordinances, you are all alike, because you are
all alike partakers of one set form of worship.

Answ. The Church of the Jews so should be a falsely constituted Church,
because however there were many Believers amongst them, yet all are commanded
to receive one Ministry of Sc^ibes and Pharisees sitting in Moses chair. But
know that the leaven of the external worship (except it evert the foundation)
does not make the Church a falsely constituted Church.

Robinson Justice p. 164.
Robinson, Mr. Smith truly affirms your Church to be a greater Antichristian
Ministry and worship then Rome, as the Temple which sanctifies the gold, and
the altar which sanctifies the offering is greater then the offering: so the
Temple of the New Testament, the Church and people of God, by whose Faith all
the Ordinances of the Church are sanctified, is greater then the Ministry,
worship, or any other Ordinance, and being Idolatrous is a greater Idol.

Answ. This is a new point of Divinity that the Faith of the Ministry or
congregation sanctifies the worship; as the Temple did the gold and the altar
the offering: yea though the Minister were a Judas, and the people latent
hypocrites, the Ordinances of God lose no authority, for all the Ministerial
sanctifying of the Ordinances is from Christ the Instituter, not from the
instruments; and the Donatists did suspend the power of the Ordinances of God,
upon the holiness, or unholinesse of the Instruments. 2. The Ministry in its
substance is not Antichristian, though it be from the Antichrist. For Prelates
giving of a ministry is not to be measured by the particular intention of the
Ordainers, but by the Nature of Gods Ordinances, and the general meaning of
all the Catbolick Church.

Robinson here objecteth, The Law says nemo potest plus juris in alium
transfer, quam ipse habet. Prelates have no calling of God themselves,
therefore they cannot give it to others.

Answ. Prelates reduplicative, as Prelates have no calling, yet as Pastors they
have, and Antichristian prelacy destroys not the essence of a Pastors office
in the subject. They object, as a Prelate he ordains Ministers, and not as a
Pastor. Answ. 1. as a Prelate he usurpeth to give a Ministry, but as a Pastor
he gives it. 2. He invadeth the place of the Church and with consent of the
Church stands for the Church, though he be not the Church, but a simple
Pastor, therefore what Ministry he conferreth, it is the deed and fact of the
Church. 3. They object, No man can give that which he has not. Answ. No man
can give that which he has not, neque virtualiter neque formaliter, true; what
he has in no respect, that he cannot give. What he has in virtue or in some
respect, that he can give. What baptism the heretical Minister has
Ministerially, that he may give validly. Hieron. in diale^ advers. Lucif^rian.
Hieronimus says, the Luciferians admitted Baptism conferred by an Heretic,
but not a Ministry, Anatolus was consecrated by Dioscorus, Faelix by the
Arrians, as Mr. John Ball answer to Can p. 98.

They say Apol. c. 1.
we find it by experience that the refusing of Church Communion has been
blessed of God, to their conversion who were holden cut. Answ. Manass^h his
being bound in fetters was a means of his conversion. David by his afflictions
learned to keep Gods Commandments: did therefore the persecuters of Manasseh or
David right and lawfully?

The Apostles (say they Apol. c. 2.
had commission to Baptize none but Disciples, Mat. 28. 19. Answ. See you doubt
not of a warrant for Baptizing children, who are not Disciples: for then the
Apostles from this place had no warrant to baptize the infants of Believers.

We should (say they Apol c. 9.
open the doors of the Church more wi^^ then God allows, how shall we lay
wittingly and willingly dead stones in the living Temple? If Christ be a Head
of pure Gold, and the Churches golden candlestick, how shall we be allowed to
put in leaden members?

Answ. This argument is against the Lords dispensation, because not without his
providence are hypocrites in the Church. It is not against his Commandment,
for he allows and commands the Church to take in Hypocrites, so they
profess the truth, and so commends that leaden toes and members be added to
Christ the Head of gold. Christ is the Head of the invisible Church properly
and according to the influence of the Life of God, but he is the head of the
visible Church as it is such according to the influence of common gifts, which
may be in Reprobates. And they may be this way in Christ's Body, who are not of
Christ's Body, as Augustine says.

We are (say they) accessory to the profaning of the Lords Ordinances. Answ.
So far as they are notoriously scandalous they are to be cast out of the
Church, and debarred from the Seals.

The Church (say they) shall be pestered with profane and carnal men, and the
blind shall lead the blind, if all be admitted to Church f^llowship.

Answ. The admission or keeping in of all to partake especially of the Lords
Supper, we do not allow. 2. The multitude of carnal men in the Church is an
inconvenience of providence, and resulteth by accident, from the receiving of
Professors to Christ's Body visible; but it is no kindly fruit growing therefrom.

A faithful servant (say they Apol. c. 11.
would admit none into his Lords House, but servicable instruments, therefore
neither may the Stewards of Gods House (which is a spiritual building) admit
any but men of spiritual gifts, living stones, sanctified and meet for the
Lords Work.

Answ. The comparison halteth many ways. 1. All in a Noble man's house, are not
stewards, you make all the Church to be stewards having the power of the Keys
to put in, and out. 2. Members are received into the Church, not only because
they are serviceable, for the masters use, but to be made servicable and to be
polished by the Word of God, and care of Pastors, but servants are taken into
great houses because they are servicable; for if that follow, that they are
made more servicable, it is not the intent of the Lord of the house, or of the
under-stewards. 3. The Economy of Princes houses is no rule for the government
of the house of the King of Kings.

Mr. Coachman Peter Coachman cry of ^ stone sect. 7. p. 16. 17.
while the materials and pillars of the house are rotten, and the house
founded upon Briers, Brambles and rubbish, that is, while wicked men are
members, no Discipline, (...) Reformation, no censures, no Election by the
multitude will do good.

Answ. The connection is naught, the fruit and power of Gods ordinances depend
not upon the conversion or non-conversion of the instruments, the preaching,
Sacraments, censures are of themselves golden and exercisers and dispensers
thereof, following Christ's direction therein are golden, eatenus in so far,
though in respect of their personal estate they be wooden and clay members
void of faith. 2. It is false that the visible Church is founded upon men or
their Faith. God strengthens the bars of his own Sion. And Christ and the
Gospel are the pillars thereof. Nay the Church strandeth not upon Peter and
Paul and the Apostles faith subjective, because the Apostles were holy men and
Believers, but upon the Apostles Faith objective, that is, upon the saving
truth that the Apostles delivered from Christ to the Churches, Ephesians. 20. 21. 1
Cor. 3. 11, 12. Mat. 16, v. 18.

Quest. 3. Whether or no there be a true Church communion with ordinary hearers
of the Word, who cannot be admitted to the Lords Supper, and what union
excommunicated persons who d^ hear the Word have with the visible Church? and
how the preaching of the Gospel is an essential note of the visible Church?

For the clearing of these confiderable points tending much to a fuller
understanding of a true visible Church in its right constitution, let these
considerations make way to what we can say of these points.

1. Did. There is a difference betwixt ordinary and settled bearers of the
Word, and transient and occasional hearers.

2. Did. Public ordinary preaching for the converting of soul^^ is a public
Church- worship. Another set way of ordinary public use of converting souls,
by preachers not in office, we know not.

3. Did. Some be members of the visible Church properly and strictly, such as
are admitted to all the seals of the covenant and holy things of God. Others
are less properly, or in an inferior degree, members of the visible Church,
such as are baptized and are ordinary hearers of the Word, but not admitted to
the Lords Supper, of old the Catechumenoi were such. As there be decr^^s of
Citizens, some having all the privileges of the City and some only right to
some privileges, but not to all. 3. Some have right to all, and are most
properly in the visible Church.

4. Did. Excommunication being medicinal and for edificati^^, cannot cut off
the member close, except we should confound killing and curing.

5. Did. There is a note of a ministerial Church, such as is preaching of the
Word of God, and a note of the visible Church of Believers, and obedience
professed to the Word preached is such a note.

6. Did. Preaching of the Word may well be a note of the Church invisible in
fieri while it is in gathering, because God purposes to convert where the Word
is purely preached. 2. A note of the invisible Church already constituted, in
so far as it is obeyed. And. 3. A note of the Ministerial Church, in respect
where God holds out the Standard of the preached word, there is his ordered
army.

1. Conclusi. To communicate with the Church ordinatily and of set purpose is
an act of external Church communion. 1. Because if the preacher in preaching
edify the Church convened for that effect to receive edification, and if he
convince the I^fidell by preaching and cause him fall down and worship God,
and report that God is in that meeting, then to communicate with the Church in
hearing and preaching is an act of external Church communion. Because an act
of worship terminated and bounded upon the Church is a Church-act. But the
prophet prophesying in public to the Church edifieth the Church and converteth
infidells in causing them to worship and acknowledge Gods presence in a
Church-meeting. As is clear. 1. Cor. 14. 4. He that prophecieth, edifieth the
Church. v. 5. v. 12. seek that you excel to the edifying of the Church. 29.
Yet in the Church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, etc. 23.
If therefore the whole Church be come together into some place and all speak
with tongues, and there come in these that are unlearned and Unbelievers, will
they not say that ye are mad? 24. But if all prophecy and there come in one
that believes not, or one that is unlearned, he is convinced of all, etc. And
that this is a Church-meeting formally, it is clear, because it is said, 34.
let your women keep silence in the Churches, now women out of a
Church-meetings are not commanded silence, for Tit. 2. 4. They are to teach the
younger women: and at home in the house, Prove. 31. 26. She opens her mouth
with wisdom, and the Law of grace is in her lips. Acts 20. 7. and upon the
first day of the week the Disciples came together to break bread, and Paul
preached to them. Had they not then a Church Communion in hearing the Word, as
in the receiving the Sacrament: Our brethren say that eating one bread together
at the Lords Table is properly a Church Communion. For thereby, we may eat one
bread we are one body, for we all partake of one bread 1 Cor. 10. 18. But
heating one word is not a Church Communion, because Infidels and Turks who are
not members of the Church may hear one word, 1 Cor. 14. 24 25. I answer 1. We
speak of a professed and resolved hearing. Turks and Infidels coming in
without purpose to join with the Church, as 1 Cor. 14. 2. 25. are not such
hearers. 2. If this were a good reason, a latent hypocrite eating one bread
with sound believers at the Lords Table, should keep no Church Communion with
the Church, for by our Brethrens Doctrine, a ^ypocrilt is no more in deed and
truth a member of the visible Church then a leg of wood is a member of a living
body.

But we hold that he is a true member of the Church as visible, and that his
binding and loosing with the Church (suppose he be an Elder) is no less valid
in Heaven, when Christ's order is followed, then the binding and loosing of a
believing Elder, and therefore that his eating at the Lords Table is an act of
external Church Communion, and of visible fellowship in a visible body, and
the same is every way strong for a visible Church Fellowship, in hearing the
Word, for that same Christ and fellowship with him, which is sealed in the
Sacrament, is preached in the Word; and as joint communicating of hypocrites
and Believers is an external Church Communion, ought to seal an internal
communion with Christ and his Church, so the joynt-hearing in a professed
adjoining to the visible Church it a compartning visible in a visible worship,
and a prosessing of an union with that same Christ and his Church in the same
word preached. For as the Apostle concludes the unity of the catholic Church
by one Baptism, so does he conclude it from one faith, and one Lord of the
covenant preached to all.

2. The visible Church of called and chosen, and not chosen, is the scope of
the parable, Mat. 22. and Luke 14. 16. 17. etc. Now v. 9. Mat. 21. All are
bidden come to the Supper, and be joynt-hearers of the Word of the Gospel,
though all be not chooses who are externally called. 1. Also if converting of
souls to the Faith of Christ be the most formal and specific act of
edifying, and of laying stones upon the chiese corner stone in the building, 1
Pet. 2. 4. 5. seeing edifying is the end whereof Christ ascending on high,
gifted his visible Church with Pastors and Doctors, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13. Then
hea^ing and joynt-hearing of a sent Pastor, Romans 10. 14. must be formally
external co^worshiping in a visible Church. For our Brethren hold that there
be now no Pastors under the New Testament, but in relation to a particular and
visible congregation. Now if our Brethren say, that pastoral teaching is an
act of a visible Church, hearing of pastoral preaching must also be an act of
Church worship. For they are relata quae se mutuo ponunt and tollunt; yea
members of a visible congregation have no Church-worship except receiving of
the Sacraments and Church censures, if hearing of a pastor be not
Church-worship.

3. Under the New Testament every congregation to our Brethren Mat. 13. The
Church of he^rers is called the visible kingdom, v. 41. Exodus 20. Hear O
Israel Ez. 33 31. they sit before thee (to hear the Word) as my people.
is a visible mount Sion. Now if under the New Testament the people are to
incite one another to public Church worship, and say. Let us go to the
mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob. and he will teach us
his ways, Esa. 2. 3. And if they shall publicly worship and ask the way to
Sion, that they may be joined in covenant to the Lord, Jer. 50. v. 5. Then is
hearing of he doctrine of Gods ways and covenant, a public church-worship,
and the service of the Church or house of the God of Jacob. But the former is
true; Ergo, so is the latter.

4. If it be not Church-worship to hear the Word, a pure and sound preaching
of the Word is no note of the Church, contrary to the Word, and the unanimous
consent of the Reformed Churches.

5. Hearing of the word is a worshipping of God. Ergo, the Church-hearing of the
word must be Church-worship. For all professing by their visible communion in
hearing the Word, one Faith, one Lord, one Hope of glory, and that as one
visible body, must thereby testify they be all joynt-worshippers of Christ and
of one God, whose covenant they preach and hear.

6. Professed hearing separateth a visible member of the church ( in genere
notarum visibilium, in the kind of visible marks) from an Infidel and Turk no
less then the receiving of the Lords Supper does.

7. Professed hearing makes the hearer under a ty of being particularly
rebuked of his sin, but particular pastoral rebuking being done by the power
of the keys presupposes the rebuked to be within; for the Church cannot judge
those who are without.

2. Conclu. Excommunicated persons though they be debarred from the Lords
Supper, and delivered to Satan, and to be accounted as heathen and publicans,
yet are they not altogether and every way cut off from the visible Church. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 14. If any obey not our word by letter, ^arke such an one, (...),
with the note of Excommunication (says Beza. an. in loc.
Beza) and have no fellowship with him, that he may be ashamed, that is, as
Calvin well expounds, exclude him out of the company of the faithful, and
Calvin com. in loc.
excommunicate him. So also Bulling. com. in loc.
Bullingerus Marlorat. in loc.
Marlorat and Iodoc^s vullichius in loc.
Iodoc. Vullichius, v. 15. Yet account him not as an enemy, but admonish him as
a brother. I know Mr. Robinson Robin. 249.
denies this place to be understood of any Excommunicated person, but he
wills the Thessalonians not to countenance, but to show their dislike of idle
persons* and his reasons are. 1. Because if Christ bids account the
excommunicated person as an Heathen and a publican, would Paul thereafter
account him as a brother? 2. Idolaters and Heretics are to be excommunicated,
and will you have such a brotherhood, as brother idolater?

But I answer, 1. We read not in the New Testament, where Christ, or his
Apostles bid break off Christian fellowship with any but there is
excommunication signified. If these words (...), have no fellowship with him,
that he may be ashamed, signify, not to forbear fellowship with him, as a
cast out person, but only to show their dislike of the sin, that he may see it,
and be ashamed: as Robinson says, there is no more punishment to be inflicted
on a contumacious person who will not obey the Apostles words, then is
inflicted for any sin to which contumacy is not added; for we are to show our
dislike of any sin, even the seen infirmities of our Brethren. For Augustine
says, peccatum tuum est, quic quid tibi non displicet, every sin in another is
thine, against which thou show not thy dislike. 2. The Law of nature does
enforce, that Lev, 19. 17. we should generally rebuk our brethren, and so show
our dislike for any sin.

3. Be not mixed in fellowship with such a man, is a public ab^^nence from
communion with him, else it does not shame him. For every showen dislike or
not-communion with another in his sin, is not that which will put public
shame on him, that he may repent, as is intimated here. 2. Christ bids not
account him a Publican, but (...) is a note of similitude. Simile qua simile
non est idem. Every thing like is not the same. So that he may well be
accounted as an Heathen, not being altogether an Heathen, and yet a Brother,
whose salvation and gaining you must intend. Nor is it altogether against the
comparison of Christ, and that gentle waiting on perverse idolaters and
excommunicate persons to admonish them as Brethren. Seeing it becomes us to be
merciful as our Heavenly Father is, 2 Timothy 2 24, 25. Mat. 5. 45. And we must
forgive our offending Brethren seventy seven times, Mat. 18. 22. And therefore
though he were twice excommunicated, he is to be dealt with as a Brother. And
an Idolatrous brother is no worse then a Samaritan neighbor or friend. 2. If
Excommunication be a medicine of the Church toward a sick son, the end
whereof is salvation, that the spirit may be saved in the Lords Day, 1 Cor. 5.
5. that he may learn not to blaspheme, 1 Timothy 1. 12. That be may be gained,
Mat. 18. 15. Ergo, he is not altogether cut off from the Church, for delivering
to Satan is medicinal, not vindictive, as the great Excommunication is which
is called Anathema Maranatha, which we cannot use, but against such, as have
sinned the sin against the Holy Ghrist, and is hardly discerned, and I would
think, such an one as Julian the Apostate should be debarred from the communion
of the word preached. But these who are ordinarily excommunicated for contumacy
and particular faults, and not for universal Apostasy, are not altogether
excluded from all brotherhood of the Church. 3. If the excommunicate person be
excluded from all privileges of Church Fellowship, then also is he excluded
from hearing the word as a sick patient under Church-medicine, for it is a
pastoral, and so to our Brethren a Church-act, that the Shepherd strengthen
the diseased, heal that which is sick, bind up that which is broken, bring
again that which is driven away, seek that which is lost, Ezec. 34. 4. And
feed the flock with knowledge, as a Pastor according to Gods heart and a
Bishop. Jer. 3. 15. Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 2. Jerem. 23. 1, 2, 3 4. Jer. 50. 7.
Esaias 56. 10. Z^ch. 11. 9, 10, 11, 12. It is a Pastoral act to preach with all
authority, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine, 2 Timothy
4. 2. 5. He should as a Pastor teach sound doctrine, exhort, convince the
gainsayers, and silence heretics, Tit. 1. 9. But seeing the excommunicated
person is not excluded from hearing the word, and the Pastor has a Pastoral
care of his soul, and is to intend that his spirit may be saved in the day of
the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 5. he cannot be utterly cut off from all Church Fellowship.
Also this Author The way of the Churches, chapter 1. sect. 1. p^op. 3.
says, that Church Members are to be admonished, and if we do it not, we hate
them in our heart, Levit. 19. 17. and if we warn not an Achan, his sin is the
sin of all Israel. Now if an excommunicated brother remain one, whom we are to
gain, and whose salvation we are to intend, if he be an ordinary coworshipper
in hearing, the object of Pastoral and brotherly teaching and admonishing, he
cannot be wholly excluded from all Church Fellowship. And this also proves
that these be members of the visible Church in some degree of Church-worship,
who yet are deba^red from the ^eale^ of the Covenant. And it cannot be said
that the excommunicated person ought not to rebuke his brother, and not hate
him in his heart, as Levit. 19. 17. Penal excommunication loses not from the
Law of nature. But our brethren make rebuking and mutual exhorting one of
another Church duties of watchfulness; then is the excommunicated in some
degree of Church Membership. Nor can our brethren here reply with good reason.
Indians and Turks may hear the Word as well as the excommunicated person, and
therefore hearing of the word is no note of Church communion.

I answer, the Turk and Indian must hear the word, but at the by, and not
professedly; but the excommunicated person by the^ty of his Covenant made in
baptism, and that relation he has to the Church under whose cure he is, for
the saving of his spirit, and to that Gospel which he professes, is obliged to
the Church Communion of public hearing the Word; yea, and according to his
oath given, to be subject to the ministry of such a man whom he chose for his
Pastor, to give obedience to him in the Lord, however in that one particular
for which he is cast cut, he has failed against all the foresaid obligations.
2. The Church, as a visible Church, exercises no medicinal acts upon Turks or
Heathen persons, and does not repute them as Heathen, but does repute them to
be Heathen. Nor has the Pastors any pastoral charge of Turks and Heathens,
except they would desire to be baptized and profess the faith. But the Church
as the Church exercises medicinal acts of shunning Christian f^ll^wship with
the excommunicated, and that with a continuated intention even when he is
excommunicated, that his spirit may be saved in the day of God, and the Pastor
has a pastoral, and so a ministerial care and obligation of pastoral
teaching, admonishing and persuading him to return to God.

4. Neither do we mean with Suarez to^. 5. ad tert. part. Thom. de censur.
disp. 5. sect. 1. de excom. not. 3.
Suarez and other Schoolmen, that excommunication does not so cut off a member
as it removes not that baptismall character, or that passive power to receive
the Sacraments; or that the prayers of the Church are not offered of direct
intention, for the inwardly humbled and repenting excommunicated person, while
the sentence of absolution be pronounced by the Church, as Soto 4. d. 22. q. 1.
Soto, Adrian de clavibus q. 3. ad 1.
Adrianus, Alanus de sacrif. Miss, l. 2. c. 3.
and Alanus thinks, because forsooth Innocentius 1 1 1. de excom.
Innocentius 111. says, the excommunicated person, though repenting, and doing
what he can to be reconciled to the Church, yet without absolution from the
censure, he is mortuus Ecclesiastice dead Ecclesiastically, and so in Heaven
also. Though Navar. c. 27. n. 18.

Turrecremata, Richard. in 4. d. 18. sect. 7. q. 2.
Richard, Anton. 3. part. tit. 24. c. 76.
Anton. think the penitent excommunicated person is included in the general
desires of the Church in their prayers, because it is not the intention of the
Church to exclude a true and living member of Christ's body from a communion
spiritual with Christ. But our meaning is, that the excommunicated person is
deprived of actual fellowship with Christ in the Seals of the Covenant, as
the Council. Araus. 11. q. 3.
Council of Arausican, A gremio (...) matris Ecclesiae and consortio totius
Christianitatis climina^us. His sin is bound in Heaven, yet so as the salvation
of his spirit is intended by the Church, see for this Augast. in Joa^. tractat.
5. and epist. 77.
Augustine. We understand not a baptismall character, except regeneration and
(...) of sins, which cannot be taken away by excommunication, and therefore a
moral claim to the holy things of God, and that for that time and state is
rather removed, then any internal right to Christ. Therefore some say, in this
he loses rather possessionem quam jus, possession then right. As a Nobleman,
for some offense, of three dwelling houses that he has, is confined to one of
the three, so as he may not remove from that one; yet does he not lose right to
the other two.

5. Our brethrens doctrine is, that none can be judged and excommunicated, but
those who are within the visible Church; 1 Cor. 5. 11, 12,
now none are within to them but such as are supposed to be regenerated and
saints; yea and more, faithful brethren, not only in profession (says our
The way of the Churches, cap. 3. sect. 3.
Author) but also in some measure of sincerity and truth. Hence none are to be
excommunicated and delivered to Satan, but regenerated persons; then it cannot
be the Churches mind, that the excommunicated persons are wholly cut off from
the visible Church, since they being the true matter of the Church, as our
brethren teach, remains therefore a part of Christ's body in covenant with God,
having right to the promises of the Covenant, and so these to whom the keys
are given, by our brethrens grounds, and are regenerated, can only be
excommunicated, and none else can be excommunicated, by their way also, for the
unregenerated are without, and so cannot be cast out.

I know not what Mr. Robinson can mean Robin. justif. of separat. p. 248.
that the Church cannot cast out (as he says) any part or parcel of her true
matter. The Church cannot excommunicate the regenerated, 1. Because (says he)
the true matter of the Church, has the form and essence of the Church, and
the Church cannot cast out her own essence. 2. The Church should deliver to
Satan the true members of Christ's body, which he abhors to write.

But I have learned of Coachman, cry of the stone sect. 4. p. 12.
Mr. Coachman that only the converted are to be excommunicated, because they
have a spirit to be saved in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. The non-converted
are flesh* but truly this is strange, Paul speaks of the incestuous person
according to the judgment of charity, as supposing hi^ to have flesh and
Spirit, as he professes himself to be a member of the Church; but truly this
is weak: for in the same Chapter Paul will have drunkards, railers,
extortioners, idolaters, to be excommunicated. Peter did really excommunicate
Simon Magus excluding him from part and portion in the visible Church. Act. 8.
21. and are such not to be excommunicated because they cannot be cast out, who
were never within? See into what inconveniences our brethren are fallen, while
they agree (I speak with reverence of those godly men) with Anabaptists in the
nature of the visible Church. But truly hypocrites are within the Church, and
when their hypocrisy does break out into grievous scandals, they are to be
cast out of the visible Church; but they cannot indeed be cast out of the
invisible Church, because they were never within the same, but our brethren
still do confound the visible and invisible Church, which in nature August. de
doct. Christi, l. 3. c. 32.

Contra cresoen. l. 2. c. 21.


and essence are opposed by way of contradiction, if Augustine say right,
multae oves extra visiblem Ecclesiam, and multi lupi intra. For the Church
invisible as it is such and essentially, is not the Church visible; and the
Church visible is not essentially invisible. But to return to Robinson, if the
regenerate cannot be excommunicated, they cannot fall into such grievous sins
as incest, murder, and contumacy to the Church, which deserves
excommunication. But this latter none can say but Novatians. Ergo, neither can
the former be said. The major is undeniable, whosoever can, and may commit sins
deserving excommunication, are to be excommunicated, as Christ says, Matthew.
18. 17. 18. and Paul, 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. Now if the converted cannot fall into
grievous sins against the Church, such as contumacy; neither can they fall into
grievous sins against God, 2. By this doctrine no professors are to be
excommunicated at all, for all within the visible Church are either converted
or non-converted; the converted are not to be excommunicated, says Robinson,
because they are the true members of the Church, and of Christ's body; now the
non-converted far less can be excommunicated, because those cannot be cast out
who are not within, as our brethren teach. For they are the false matter of the
Church, and no part of it, yea (and as our Author says,) have no measure of
sincerity and truth; and therefore cannot be members of the Church. Now the
Church (say our brethren) cannot judge those which are without, 1 Cor. 5. 12. 3
This opinion is just the opinion of the Anabaptists, that the true members of
the visible Church are only regenerate persons, and they only have the
essence of the true membership, which is false; they are within the visible
Church, and truly within the net, and a part of the ground called the Kingdom
of God, Matthew. 13. 4. Though they be not members of the invisible Church of
believers and the redeemed in Christ. 4. The Nicolaitans, Iezabel, the false
Apostles, the spreaders of Balaams doctrine, Revel. 2. and those who offend in
Christ's Kingdom are all necessarily either not to be excommunicated at all, or
necessarily they are all unconverted, by Robinsons doctrine, or all converted,
by Mr. Coachmans way. And the Church then shall not bind and loose in Heaven,
but clave errante, except they be all known certainly to be converted who are
excommunicated, or certainly known not to be converted. But this were
ridiculous; the object of excommunication by Christ is one which refuses to
hear the Church, whether he be converted, or not converted. 5. All our Divines
standing for the cerainty of the perseverance of the regenerated, answer
Papists and Arminians alleging for the apostasy of the Saints, the example of
the regenerated who may be excommunicated, that excommunication does never
evince that the person excommunicated is out of the state of grace, but only
that he has fallen into a scandalous external fact, which deserves that he
should be delivered to Satan, and that one may be a member of the visible
Church and converted to God, who is excommunicated. Lastly, Robinsons arguments
do bewray great Ignorance in the doctrine of the true Church; to wit, that
first it should follow, that if the Church excommunicate a converted person, it
should destroy its own essence; for conversion is the essence of the invisible
Church, not of the visible Church, and is not destroyed by excommunication. But
the believer is edified thereby, for he is delivered to Satan for the
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord;
but that he is cut off from the visible Church is no more inconvenient, then to
cut off a rotten apostume of excrescent carnosity of the body, which hurts
the physical integrity of the body, but does not take away any part of the
essence, so as it should not thereafter be a living body. His mixed argument
has a cry, but no force; It should follow that the member of Christ's body
(says he) should be delivered to Satan; which is not inconvenient, for this is
the Ordinance of Christ to save the men's spirit, and to teach him not to
blasph^me, 1 Cor. 5. 5. 2 Timothy 1. 20. It were an inconvenience to deliver a
member of Christ to Satan morally, as 1 Cor. 6. 15. This is a sinful
deliverance, when one is given over to Satan, that Satan may work in him as in
his workhouse, and as in a child of disobedience, Ephesians. 2. 2. a converted
soul cannot thus be delivered to Satan, and this we abhor to write, no less
then Robinson. But to deliver to Satan penally, as to a penal tortuter who
works sorrow and fear in the conscience for sin, to humble the offender,
and to save his spirit in the day of Christ, is neither horror by word nor by
writ, but the Word of God, 1 Cor. 5. 5.

Now to say something of the sorts and nature of excommunication. We
acknowledge not what Navar. Enc^^r. c. 27. n. 13.
Navarrus and G^^g. n. q. 3. c. 1.
Gregory say, That excommunication, whether just or unjust, is to be feared;
for, the curse causl^sly does not fall. The sentence is either given out, a
jure, vel ab homine by the Law, or the persons. Secondly, it is either just or
unjust. Thirdly, and that three ways; Exanimo, good or ill zeal; secondly, Ex
causa, a just or unjust cause; thirdly, Ex ordine, when order of Law is kept.
An unjust sentence is either valid or null. That which is invalid is either
invalid through defect of the good mind of the excommunicators, and this is
not essential to the excommuncations validity. That which is invalid this way
only, ligat, it binds in fo^o exteriore. But that which is u^just through
want of a just cause, it only binds from external communion; but because
Gods Ordinances are to be measured from their own nature, and the general
intention of the Catholic Church, and not from abuses and particular
intentions of such excommunicators; therefore they do not exclude from the
general Church-desires. The fourth Council of Carthage, Council 4. Carthag.
as also Gerson de excom. cons. 4.
Gerson says, an unjust sentence neminem gravare debet; should affright no
man. I see not a warrant for division of excommunication into penal and not
penal excommunication. The ancients made some excommunication not penal, as
the Council. Carthag. 5. c. 10.
fifth Council of Carthage, and Council. Arelatens. 2. c. 19.
Concilium Arelatense. Council. Turraconens. c. 6.
Turraconense, Council. Agathens c. 35.
Concilium Agathense. As if one should culpably absent himself from a Synod,
erat privatus Episcoporum communione; He was for a space excommunicated from
the communion of other Bishops. The Canonists Stephan. Qu. in summa. Bulla 5.
con. provinc. n. 7. q. 18.
infer, that this excommunication was no Churchcensure; and M Antonius de Dom.
Arch. Spalat. de repub. eccles. l. 5 c 9 n. 6, 7.
M. Antonius of Spalato defends them in this. But since Christ for scandals
appointed only public rebuking; or secondly, confessing; or thirdly,
excommunication from the Church, not only of Church guides, but of professing
believers; Mat. 18. 17, 18.
we see not how any are to be excommunicated from the fellowship of the Clergy,
or Church-guides only. For Christ ordained no such excommunication. and
therefore we are to repute this a popish device. Zosimus Z^s. epist. 2.
says Zancbius, Coelcst. cp. 6.
Celestinus, Horm. cp. 45
Hormisda and Pelagius 2. Pelag. 2. cp. 1
did threaten to excommunicate John of Constantinople from the communion of the
Apostolic seat, and of all Bishops. Spalato his argument M. Anton. de dom.
loc. citat. n. 8.
for this sort of excommunication is, 2 Thessalonians 3. 15. which commands
all Thessalonians to forbear any fellowship with such as obeys not the
Apostles doctrine, and does not infinuate any excommunication from the society
of Church-guides only. Nay, such an excommunication is not in Gods Word.
Cajetan Cajet. com. in 2 Thessalonians. 3. 15
calls it excommunicatio claustralis, whereby some were interdicted the
company of some other Church-orders. It is true, that in the ancient Church the
excommunicated person was debarred from coming to the Church to hear divine
Service. And Sylvester appoints three degrees of excommunication; first,
Debarring of the contumacious from entering into the Church; secondly, A
suspending of them from communion with the Church; thirdly, An anathema or
imprecation by cursing them. So the fifth Synod under Symmachus appointed first
that the contumacious should be deprived of the Communion; and if he should not
repent, it was ordained, ^^ anathemate feriatur, that he should be cursed. So
say diverse of the Schoolmen and Casuists, as Solo disp. 22. q. 1. art 4.

Papists acknowledge, no excommunicated person is debarred from hearing the
Word. But it is to be observed carefully, that for the same reasons Papists
think the excommunicated persons should hear Sermons and the Word preached,
that our brethren say, Because preaching is an act of jurisdiction and
authority, but not an act of order; and therefore preaching is not an act of
Church Communion, but common to any who have not received orders, and may be
performed, as the reading of the Word by Deacons, and those who have
Priesthood or power to administrate the Sacraments. And Innocent. 3. verb.

Innocentius the third says, Preaching is proper to Priests, who have received
orders by no divine Law. Leo 1. cp 63 cap. adjicimus ib q. 1.

Suarez says, That Christ in these words, John 21. Feed m^sheep; and Matthew.
28. Preach the Gospel; gave power of jurisdiction, but not of order only: It
is given commonly (says he) to the Clergy to preach, and to Deacons, because
decentius, it is more fi^ly and decently performed by them then by Laics.
Though it be true that two Cardinals, Tol. com. in Joan. 21. an 7.

Navar. sum. 26 c. 11. 163.
Navarrus says, Preaching (soli sacerdotio institutione divina adjuncta est)
is by divine institution proper to the Priesthood. Yet this excluding of them
from coming into the Church, was from coming in to the holy place only where
the Lords Supper was celebrated; and they stood at the Church door where they
might hear the Word, and therefore were called (...) and (...) hearers and
murmurers, as Basil, cp. 3. ad Amph. c. 58.
Bas^lius says, and Field book 3 of the Church. cap. 15.
Field, Excommunication does not wholly (says he) cut off men from the visible
Church, and his reason is good, because they may and often doeretaine, first,
The profession of pure truth; secondly, The character of Baptism; thirdly,
They profess obedience to their Pastors; fourthly, They will not join to any
other communion. And therefore to say with our Author The Way of the Churches
of Christ in N. E. chapter 4. sect. 6.
we dare not, to wit, That though the seed of faith may remain in the
excommunicated person; yet to the society of the faithful joined in a
particular visible Church, they are not knit, but wholly cut off from their
communion. Also, he is delivered unto Satan, and therefore wholly cut off from
the communion of the Church; and so from the seals, he and his seed, as heathen
and heathens seed are. We condemn Novatians, because (as Cyprianl. 4. cp. 2.
Cyprian says) they denied mercy to the repenting excommunicated person, and
because (as Socrates l. 7. c. 25.
Socrates said of them) God only can forgive sins. And we condemn the
Donatists, who would not (as August. contra Donatistas de bapt. lib. 5. cap. 1.
Augustine says) receive into the Churches commmunion again such as had
delivered to persecuters the Bible and other holy things. So we are to condemn
these who are more rigorous toward such as are excommunicated, then Christ is:
for Christ keeps them, as sick children, within his visible Church, and uses
Satan as the Physicians servant who boyleth Herbs and dresseth Drugs for them,
while he by Gods permission, tormente^hthes spirit with the conscience of
sin. As when a child is sick (says worthy Cartwright C t^h.
Cartwright) the Father calls a College of physicians to consult about
medicine, to be given to the child. So i^ the contumacious person under the
medicine of excommunication administered by the Church-presbytery. Now this we
cannot say of heathen and publicans.

that they are not members of the visible Church actu pleno, in a full act,
because they want external communion with the Church, yet actu imperfecto,

nourishment is yet still a member.

Our Divines from Scripture make three degrees of excommunication. 1. A
debarring from the Lords Supper, Mat. 5. 24. but it is not indeed a delivering
to Satan or excommunication: this is called the lesser excommunication. 2. A
delivering to Satan, the greater excommunication. 1 Cor. 5. 3. 4. of this we
speak here especially. 3. Maran-atha in the Syriack an is utter cursing till
Christ's second coming.

3. Conclus. We hold the preaching of the word to be an essentia note of the
visible Church. Our Brethren as Coachman. the cry of a stone sect. 3 p 8.
Mr. Coachman Robinson. Justis. of separat. p. 8.
Robinson The way of the churches Chapter 1. Sect. 2.
our present Author, deny that the profession or preaching of the Word is a
true note of the visible Church. Because, Acts 17, Paul preached to the
scoffing Athenians, who were not for that a visible Church. 2. Papists have
some of Gods Ordinances, and heretics also, as baptism; and the Old and New
Testament as the Philistines had the Ark of God amongst them. 3. The word may
be preached, where Christ is but gathering a Church, and so is a mean of
gathering a Church, and therefore not an essential note of a gathered and
constituted Church. But herein our Brethren say no more against the Reformed
Churches, then Stapleton relect. 1. con. de Eccl. 4. 4. ar. 5. and ib. note ^.

confession: because they think with Socinians, that there is no ministry now
necessary, and so public preaching is not a note of the Church, especially
since every gifted man may preach the Word. Socinus in his tractate De
Ecclesia, and his Catechism of Raccovia, says. Notae evangelicorum nihil
valent; 'Doctrina pura est Ecclesiae natura and essentia quae dat ei esse,
ad^oque signum ejus esse non potest; cum signum ipsum, a re c^jus est signum,
differ oporteat. But the truth is, the preaching of the Word has diverse
relations. 1. As the members of the visible Church are in fi^ri, in the way to
be gathered, the Word preached and believed is a way of gathering a Church,
Romans 10. 14. 1 Cor. 1. 23. 1 Cor. 3. 5. Acts 16. 14. 2. That same word
preached, believed, and outwardly professed is a sign of the visible Church.
For where Gods pastors and shepherds are, there be flocks of redeemed ones,
Cant. 1. 8. John 10. 12, 13, 14. 3 The Word simply preached and professed in a
settled way of a fixed ministry is a note of a ministerial Church; this is
clear from Gods intention, for he sends it of purpose to save his own, as
Romans 10. 14. Acts 20. 28. For a man lights not a Candle in his house for
nothing. So this word preached, as it is Gods Word, is not properly the form
and essence of the Church, but as believed and received, it is the form of the
Church invisible. 2. But to profess this word savingly, est signum Ecclesiae,
non not A, it is a sign, that does not infallibly notify to us that such is
for this time an invisible Church of redeemed ones: for I have not infallible
certainty what one man, or what determinate number of men by name are true
believers, profession may beguile me, as also the invisible Church (as such) is
believed, and not known infallibly by any note or external mark that
incurreth into the senses. Neither is the preaching of the Word a note or
infallible mark of the Church ministerial to all, or in relation to Infidels;
for the Word preached actu primo and ex natura sua, essentially and of its own
nature, is more known and more sensible then the Church: because the preached
word is a Doctrine expounding what the true Church is, and we do not expound
ignotum per ignotius, vel per aeque ignotum. Darkness cannot let us see
darkness, or colors; only light does reveal things. But the word preached in
relation to unbelievers cannot be an infallible note of the Church, for to a
blind man the morning as not a sensible mark that the sun is rising; nor is
smoke to a dead man, a sensible mark of fire, because he has no senses to
discern either. So to the infidel though the word as a sound, or in a
literal evidence be clearer then the Church, and in a confused knowledge he
knows the one better than the other; yet is the true word, in respect of
certain knowledge and spiritual evidence, as dark to him as the Church: for
he has not Ears to hear, nor eyes to see any of the things of God, either
the word preached, or the Church; and therefore the word is both by nature and
to us, and natura and nobis, in respect of distinct knowledge, more known, but
not simply as the word, actu primo, but actu secundo, as it both strikes upon
outward and inward senses and as i^ reveals and discovers the things of
God, according to that, 1 Cor. 14. 24. But if all prophecy, and there come one
who is an unbeliever, and an unlearned, he is convinced of all and judged of
all. v. 25. and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so falling
down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is in you, of a
truth. So here is Gods order how the word preached is a notifying mark
discovering to an unbeliever the true Church. It I would point out one of the
Kings Courtiers by this, that he has a purple cloak and a blew scarf, if the
man to whom I notify the Courtier, do neither know what a purple garment is,
nor what a blew scarf is, the mark shall be no mark to him: yet are these
sufficient marks in their own nature, if we suppose that no other Courtiers
are in that manner apparelled. Therefore I would difference betwixt notam
notificantem and notam notificativam, a note that of its own nature does make
a thing known, or that which actually makes a thing known to some.

The settled professed preaching of the Word is a note of the visible Church
Ministerial, and that there either is, or in Gods own time shall be some
invisible Church of sanctified ones there. 1. Because, Deuteronomy. 4. 6 the hearing
and doing of Gods Word makes the Church of the Jews a renowned and wise
people in the fight of the Nations. 2. The preaching of the Word and
administration of the Sacraments are proper to the Church and distinguish them
from other Nations, Psalm. 147. 19. He shows his word unto Jacob, and to
Israel his statutes and his judgments, 20. He has not dealt so with any
Nation. So Deuteronomy. 17. 29. 30 31 32. The Lords worship is so peculiar to his
Church as it differenceth them from all others. So Esd. 2. 8. 3. Esa. 59. last
verse. 3. The Church is defined, Acts 2. 42. a company of these who profess
truly, and continue in the Apostles doctrine and breaking of bread. 4. The
planting and gathering of Churches is expounded to be teaching and baptizing,
Mat. 28. 19. 20. 5. Christ's sheep hear his voice in his own sent shepherds,
Joh. 10. 27. 28. 6 The Church is a company built upon the Doctrine of the
Prophets and Apostles, Ephesians. 2. 20. 7 The Church is the pillar and ground of
truth, 1 Timothy 3. 15. because the Church teaches, professes, and keeps the
truth. So August. l. de unitat. Eccles. c. 2.
Augustine Tertullian advers. Heret.
Tertullian Hieron. com. in Psalm. 133.
Hierom. Chrysostom. bom. 40. in Mat.
and Chrysostom will have us to seek the true Church by the true Word of God,
and not by men's word. Robins. just. p. 256.
Robinson objecteth first; Profession of the truth made by men of lewd
conversation makes them not the Church; because they deserve to be cast out of
the Church, but by men visibly and externally holy, Mat. 3. 6. Acts 1. 38. Act.
2. 37, 38. 1 Cor. 15. 1. Mat. 10. 40. 41. Acts 8. 12, 13.

Answ. These and many other places do strongly prove our point; and especially,
that the profession of Simon Magus who before God deserved to be cast out of
the Church, Acts 8. is sufficient to make one a member of a visible Church. Yea
but none deserve in foro Ecclesiae, in the Churches Court to becast out, but
such as either confess scandalous sins, or are contumacious, or convicted
judicially of the same before witnesses, otherwise the dearest to Christ, do
legally before God deserve all to be cast out.

Robinson says, The word in the Bible is no note of the true Church, but the
Word believed and obeyed; for Papists have the Bible. And Coachman ^ry of the
stone sect 3. page 8. and p 3.
Mr. Coachman says, the Philistims had the Arc amongst them; and a Jesuit at
a river side baptized with a skoop a thousand Indians; were they for that a
true Church? and Papists, ( says our The way of the Churches chapter 1. sect. 3
Author) have baptism.

Ans. The like is objected by Socinus, Theoph. Nicolaides, Cattch.
Raccoviensis, and by Anabaptists. But first we make not the word and material
Bible, and naked seals the marks of the true invisible Church; we are now
disputing about the marks of a visible Church. 2. We make not the naked
presence of Word and Sacraments true marks of the Church; but a settled
professed erected feeding by shepherds, feeding with knowledge, we make a
mark of the shepherds Tents; which way neither Philistines nor Indians have
the Word of God: and for the Church of Rome; we cannot deny but she retains
so much of the essence of a ministerial Church, as makes baptism
administrated by them to be true baptism, that is, a valid seal, though she
cannot (...) be called a true ministerial Church.

Other two questions here are shortly to be discussed, as belonging to this
purpose; as 1. whether discipline be a mark of the visible Church? Mr.
Robinson Robins. just. of separ. p. 282, 283.
says, the power of censures is simply necessary for the being of the Church,
sundry of our Divines affirm it is. So the Prof. Leyd. in Synop. pur. Theol.
disp. 4. these. 41.
learned Professors of Leyden, and Ursin, Pareus in Catech. Expl. q. 59. art. 6
de Ecces.
Ursin with Pareus. Great Jun. to 1. disp. theol. 44. These. 41 42.
Junius says, it is a note belonging to the Churches order, ad decorum, the
August. confess. art. 7.
Augustine confession leaves it out from amongst the notes, and so does Calvin
Galvin. inst. 4. c. 1. sect. 9.
and Whittakerus Whittak. de Eccl. cont. 2. q. 5. c. 17.
make two notes only, Word and Sacraments. Learned Beza in confess. art. 7.
Beza makes only the preaching of the Word a note, not excluding the other
two. I think Distinctions may help the matter; 1. There is a power of
discipline, and there is a care thereof. True Churches have a power given them
of Christ, and this Robinson proves, and no more; yet the care to exercise the
power may be wanting in a true Church.

2. Distinct. Right discipline is not necessary for the essence of a visible
Church. All our Divines condemn Anabaptists and Pelagians, who plead that
righteous men only, and such societies as have right discipline to be true
Churches. 2. Novatians and Donatists came near to them in this also, as we may
see in August. cont. Don^^ist.
Augustine. So Serve. of the Church book. 1. chapter 18.
Rich. Field, Parker de polit. Eccl. l. 1. c. 17.
Parker, Cartwright advers. haeres. ibid citatur.
Cartwright make it necessary to the wel-being of the Church; 1. Because it is
not indifferent. 2. Because it is commanded in Gods word. 3. Discipline in the
substantial points is immutable. 4. It is necessary in respect of the end. And
all this Parker de Politia l 1. per totum lib^um.
the learned Parker demonstrateth to be true. But it is not necessary simply to
the being of it: as a City may be without walls, a Garden without an hedge.

3. Distinct. The power and right to discipline is a propriety essential to
the Church, and is not removed from it, till God remove the Candlestick, and
the Church cease to be a visible Church; but the exercise may be wanting and
the Church a true visible Church, from which we are not to separate.

4 Discipline is a necessary note and unseparable from a visible Church, whole,
entire, and not lame and imperfect. But ^ Church may retain the essence and
being of a visible Church, and yet have no discipline in actual use, or
little, and though want of discipline do leaven a Church, yet it does not (as
Robinson says) evert the nature thereof, and turn it into Babylon and a den
of Dragons. Robinson will have profaneness and impiety by absolute necessity
rooted out by discipline, but he is too hasty. Nay not by public preaching of
a sent Pastor, through absolute, but only through ordinary and conditional
necessity. You bind the Almighty too hard.

The other question is, if conversion of sinners be an ordinary effect of a
public and sent ministry? Our brethren in their answer to the 32 Questions
sent to them, deny this; but no marvel, seeing all conversion to them is done
without the public ministry by only private Christians, and in this we see
no necessity of a called ministry to convert men to Christ, which is the
doctrine of Socinians and Anabaptists. So Chemnitius part. 2. Locor. de Eccles.
p. 314 Anabaptis^ae dicunt si quis doctrinam Evangelii tr^elligat seve sit
suitor sive sartor (...) faber eam do^ere and concionari d^bere.
Chemnitius, so Gastius de err^ribus Catabaptistarnm, l. 1. c. 15.
Gastius teaches. The Socinian Theol. Nicolaides ^^ act. (...) de Eccles. c.

Theo. Nicolaides, Luther erred, (says he) when he asked from Muncerus his
calling to preach, Muncerus was an Anabaptist. So Ostorodius inst. c. 42.
Ostorodius in his institutions, and Raddetius in notis ad lib. Smigles. p. 32.
Raddetius who objected the same that our brethren do, that the whole
believers be a royal Priesthood. But though we deny not, but some may be
converted by the teaching and private conference of private Christians; yet the
ordinary public way is by the Word preached by a se^^ Pastor, as is clear,
Romans 10. 14. 1 Cor. 3. 5. Acts 9. 10. Acts 10. 5, 6, etc.

CHAP. 10. SECT. 10.
Concerning our order and form in administration of Gods public worship.
THe Author here contendeth for the worship of God in its native simplicity,
without all ceremonies; to which I can oppose nothing, but shall prove the
unlawfulness of humane ceremonies in another Treatise, God-willing.

Of the communion of the visible Catholic Church.
Jesus Christ has now under the N. Testament a Catholic visible Church on
earth (for of that part of the Catholic Church now triumphing in glory; or of
that part which only is a Church of elected Saints, and are not yet formally a
professing Church, but only such in the predestinatiun of God, I spoke not
now) and to this Church universal, visible, has the Lord given a ministry,
and all his Ordinances of Word and Sacrament principally and primarily and to
the ministry and guides of this Catholic visible Church has the Lord
committed the Keys, as to the first subject, and for the visible Church
Catholic, including also the invisible Church; as for the object and end has
he given his ordinances and the power of the keys; And the Ministry and
ordinances are not given to this or this Congregation which meets ordinarily
in one place, principally, 1. The Lord Jesus gave this Ministerial power to
the universal guides of the catholic Church, the Apostles as they did
represent the Presbytery of the whole Catholic visible Church, Ioh. 20. 21. As
my Father sent me, so send I you. 22. And when he had thus said he breathed on
them, and said, receive the Holy Ghost. 23 whosoever sins you remit, they are
remitted; and whosoever sins you retain, they are retained. The Apostles
here receive the keys in name of the whole Catholic Ministerial guides. For
in this the Apostles must stand in the person and room of a single society of
believers united by a Church covenant in one parishonall Church, if our
brethrens grounds stand good; so as a Parishionall Church must be the only
successors of the Apostles, but this no Word of God can warrant. Nor is the
Eldership of a single Congregation that which the Apostles here represented;
except you say to this Eldership, as to the first subject, is this message of
sending, as the Father sent Christ, committed, and to this Eldership within one
Congregation is the power Ministerial of pardoning and retaining sins given;
For I ask, from whence, or from whose hands do the Eldership of a Congregation
receive the keys? from Jesus Christ, say they, but this is no answer, the
Ministry according to its institution is no doubt only from the head of the
body the Church, from Jesus Christ. But I ask now of an ordinary
Church-calling; and I demand from whose hands under Jesus Christ have this
particular Eldership received Ministerial power: they cannot say from
themselves, for they do not make themselves Ministers: they will not say from
a College of Presbyters of many congregations, for they are flatly against all
such presbyteries, and that which they say indeed, the Eldership of a
congregation has their Ministerial power from the people. Well then, the
Apostles when they received the keys they did represent the people: but what
people? not the people of a classical presbytery, of a Province, of a Nation,
of the whole redeemed Church, but of one single congregation; how shall this be
made out of the Text, or out of one Word of God, I see not. 2. Christ ascending
on high, and giving some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some
Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, 12. For the perfecting of the
Saints, (not of Ephesus, far less of one single Congregation only) for the
work of the Ministry (in general) for the edifying of the Body of Christ
(not a congregationall body only) 12. Till we all meet in the unity of the
Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Consider I pray you, that
Christ's intention in giving a Ministry is not for a congregation of forty, or
sixty, or a hundred, as if he intended to impawn all power in that
Congregationall body; but he intended the edifying of his body Catholic, and
the coming of all to the unity of the Faith. A Congregation of sixty cannot be
all Saints, and this power is clearly given to that body, which the Lord is to
make a perfect man, according to the measure of the fullness of the stature of
Christ, this is a mystical man, and the Catholic body of Jesus Christ. Call
it a Congregation and you wrest the Scripture, and vilify the noble and large
end for the which Christ has given a ministry: as ask to what end, and to
what first and principal subject has the Lord given reason and a faculty of
discoursing, is it to Peter, to John, etc. as to the first subject, and for
them as for their good? no, no, it is for and to the race of mankind. The case
is is just so here, 1 Cor. 12. 28. God has placed some in the Church, first
Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, etc. Is the meaning thus? God
has placed in the body of a single Congregation Apostles? Where do you read
that? I believe Apostles have the Catholic visible Church for their Parish;
and is it a Congregationall body, wherein God placed such variety of members,
as Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, Works of miracles, gifts of Healing, Helps,
Governments, etc? So Romans 12. 5. So we being many are one body in Christ, and
every one members of another. Hence he reckons out diverse offices in this
body. Now this is not one Congregation only, but that one Body of Christ
whereof Christ is head, this is the Catholic Church.

2. What power ministerial our Brethren affirm to be given to a
Congregation, they say it is given to them under the notion of a flock of
redeemed ones, of the Spouse, and body of Christ, as they cite for this act,
20. 28. and Col. 1. 18. Ephesians. 1. 22 and under the notion of the City of God, the
Kingdom, house and building of Christ, but so they come to our hand, for this
reduplication, or notion of a flock of redeemed ones, of the body and spouse of
Christ, of the City, Kingdom, House, Building, agree first to the Catholic
Church as is clear, Col. 1. 8. Ephesians. 5. 25 26. 1 Timothy 3. 15. Ephesians. 2. 19, 20, 21,
22. and secondarily only to a Congregation as it is a part of this universal
flock. 3. The whole Catholic Church visible is made one ministerial body
Cant. 6. 4. beautiful as Tirzah, comely as the City of Jerusalem, terrible as
an army with banners. By reason of their order of discipline, and is there
called an organicall body having v. 6 7 8. Eyes, Hair, Teeth Temples, Locks
and having particular Churchs under her, three score Queens, fourscore
concubines, and virgins without number. Yet is it said, v. 9. My Dove, my
undesiled is but one, she is the only one of her Mother. Ainsworth who here may
be more then a witness, says this Ainsworth an. in Cant. 6.
one Church is the daughter of Jerusalem who is above and the mother of us ^ll.
C^ton a witness not inferior says on this place: Cotton in Cant. 6.
The true catholic Church of Christ is the Mother of all reformed Daughters,
and that argument that our Brethren uses to prove a particular Church to be
visible, because of external communion (not in one House, for that is
accidental to visibility, one congregation may meet in three caves of the
Earth, in time of persecution, and yet remain one congregation) holds good
in this catholic church made up of so many organs, as a congregation is
formed. 1. Begetting by the Ministry of the word, daughter-Churches to God, as
they say a congregation does, nor is it enough to say Jerusalem is not one by
external government and order of Discipline, because they cannot meet together
to exercise Discipline, but she is one invisibly, because she has one Faith,
one Lord, one Baptism, one Spirit, one Hope of glory. For the Text says, they
have one and the same Organs, Teeth, Eyes, Hair, Temples, Locks; they are one
Jerusalem, and compact City, one Army terrible by the Sword of of discipline.
2. We do not say, to make them one visible church, that they must have one
visible actual government, in external order: for when of a congregation of
60. their be 30 absent through sickness and the business of a lawful calling,
they are one Church visible, though in one metting you cannot see them all with
one cast of your Eye; and when the church of Jerusalem exceeding in number ten
thousand, did meet in part. from House to House, that is in sundry Houses; yet
continuing in the same doctrine of the Apostles, and in fellowship and in
breaking of bread, and in prayer, Acts 2. 46. 32. our brethren will say, they
are one church. And therefore the power of Discipline, and the exercise of the
Word, Seals, and Discipline in parts, is sufficient to make one visible
catholic Church. 4. To that Church has Christ given, as to the first church,
the ordinances and ministry, which he principally intends to perfect, to
gather, and to bring to the unity of faith in a perfect body by these ordinances
and that Ministry; because the wisdom of Christ has not given his Ministry,
and Ordinances to the catholic Church, intending principally to save them,
except he give them a power in that Ministry to the first subject, which being
put forth in acts may compass that end. But Jesus Christ principally intends,
to perfect to gather, to bring to the unity of faith in a perfect body, by these
ordinances and Ministry, the whole catholic visible church, and secondarily
only this or this particular congregation. Ergo, Christ has given to the whole
catholic Church, as to the first Church, the ordinances and Ministry, and so
in this Mioistery catholic, he ha h given the Keys to this catholic Church
visible as to the first Church.

5. I prove it thus, when ever Chrst gives gifts to a whole, he gives it to
the whole, by order of nature, before he give it to the parts of that whole, as
is clear by induction. He gives Christ a gift to the whole Church, by order of
nature, first to the World, Joh. 3. 16. Then to this or this believer of the
World. So he gives redemption and grace by order of nature first to his Church
in general, Ephesians. 5. 25. Christ dies first for his Church, not this or that
single company, or particular person, first for His sheep, that is, the whole
flock, Joh. 10. v. 11. then for this or this company, or this of this straying
sheep; He came to seek and save, first the lost, Luke 19. 10. then this or
this lost man. He died first to gather together in one, not one man only, ye
not the nation of the Jews only, but to gather together in one, all the
Children of God, which were scattered abroad, Ioh. 11. 25. and he is a
propitiatiou by order of nature. First, for the sins of the whole World, 1
Ioh. 2. 1. and then secondarily, for our sins, so has he given the gifts of
Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers, first to, and for Saints, in common and in
general, and not for this and that Saint, or for this company of Saints at
Ephesus. Now that particular Congregations are parts of the great visible
Church; I prove, and first that they are parts visible of a Presbytery, or a
circuit of Congregations, within the local bounds of a Presbytery. I make good
thus. Those who have one common necessary object of external government in
Church Affairs, those are a whole visible community gifted with power from
Christ to rule in that common and necessary object of government, and this and
this portion of this whole community must be parts of that whole. But those
Congregations within the local bounds of the circuit of a Presbytery have one
common necessary object of external government, in Church affairs; Ergo,
those Congregations in such a circuit must be parts of this whole. The major I
take from our Brethren, who therefore make a particular Congreation to be one
in respect of ordinary meeting, to partake of word, seals, and to transect
matters of jurisdiction, amongst themselves, but this agrees to many
congregations within one circuit, for they meet occasionally one with another
in hearing the word and receiving the seals; and for the assumption I prove it
thus, all those congregations have these particulars of external government in
Church affairs, which they cannot transact within their own Congregations,
but do ex aequo belong to them all. As 1. That they do not give offense one
to another; that one Church do not hold the Doctrine of Balaam to the effence
and scandal of other Churches. 2. That one Congregation make not Acts and
Canons against the Word of God, and against the Acts of another Congregation
agreeable to the Word of God. 3. That one Church admonish, rebuke, comfort,
provoke another to love and to good works, in such and such points; now though
a Congregation make acts and constitutions for governing this, or that member
of the community; yet they do not, nor cannot make acts that oblige the
community and the Church as the Church; the Church as the Church being a part
is to be regulated by the whole, and if there be things that ex aequo concern
all, and do not concern one particular Church more then another, one
particular Congregation cannot govern in these. And by the like reason
particular Churches and classical Presbyteries, and Provincial and National
Churches, are parts of the whole Catholic visible Church.

6. Because Christ has not given the power of Ministry and Ordinances, and
Jurisdiction to the single Congregation as to the first subject upon the ground
that our Brethren speak, to wit, because the single Congregation is that
Spouse to which Christ is referred as an Husband, and that body to which he
carries the relation of an head, communicating life to all the members, Ephesians.
1. 22. Col. 1. 18. nor is it that adequat number of ransomed persons, of
sheep, of lost ones, of fellow-citizens, of spiritual stones, etc. To the
which Christ does carry that adequat and complete relation of a Savior, of a
good Shepherd, of a Seeker of lost ones, of a King and Governor, of the
chief c^^ner-stone. Therefore that visible Church for whose salvation Christ
has given the Ministerial power, must be the larger visible Church, just as
the God of Nature has given to the whole race of sheep, a power to seek their
own food, and because of their simplicity, a power to be ordered and led by the
shepherd, and secondarily this power is given to this or this flock feeding on
Mount Caermel, or elsewhere: so has the God of Grace given a power to the
whole visible Catholic flock to submit themselves, in the Lord, to other
guides, and he has given to the whole company of Shepherds as to the first
subject the power of the Keys, and secondarily the power is given to this or
this visible Church, and company of Pastors.

7. When any scandalous person is delivered to Satan, he is cast out of the
whole Catholic Church; Ergo, he was before his ejection a member of the whole
catholic Church, for hecannot be cast out, who was never within. And when he
is excommunicated, his sins bound, as in Heaven, so on Earth, that is, not only
in that Tract of ground, where a handful of a little Congregation independent
(as they say) of 10 or 20 or an 100 does ordinarily feed, but in all the
visible World where God has a Church. and all both within the little
Congregation where he is, and without, are to repute him as an Heathen and a
Publican. It is true some of our Brethren say, he is excommunicated only out
of that Congregation whereof he is a member antecedenter, because Christ has
given the power of excommunication only 1 Cor. 5. 4. To the congregated
Church, when they are met together to deliver to Satan, and they must do it, in
collegio, in consessu, coram tota Ecclesia, before and in presence of the
Church congregationall, which is to give their consent and has a certain
power of interest in the business, but he is cast out and excommunicated to all
other Churches only consequenter, by consequent, and by virtue of the
communion of Churches: I answer, the plain contrary; he is antecedenter and
formally delivered to Satan, by the power of the catholic visible Church which
is put forth in exercises, and in act before that Church whereof he is a
nearest member. Even as the left hand does cut off a finger of the right hand,
which otherwise should infect the whole body. Now it is not the left hand
only that cutteth off the contagious and infectious finger, but the whole man,
deliberate reason and the will consents it should be done for the
preservation of the whole man; the left hand is a mere instrument, and the
loss of the finger is the loss of the whole body, and the finger is cut off
the right hand not antedenter, and only off the right hand by that power
intrinsecall only in the right hand, but intrinsecall in the whole body; it is
true the contagion should creep through, and infect the right hand, and right
arm first, and therefore incision is made upon the right hand. So if the
Eldership of a Congregation deliver to Satan, it is not done by that power that
is intrinseally only in that Congregation, but by the power intrinsecall in
the whole universal Church, who shall keep communion with him that Eldership
cuts him off as the instrument, or hand of the Church catholic, and the
incision (as it were) is performed there in that meeting (I will not say of the
whole Congregation, that is to be proved) because the contagion shall come
first upon these with whom the delinquent is to keep the nearest fellowship,
and that Excommunication be performed in a meeting I grant, and the place, 1
Cor. 5. 4. says so much, and a meeting of the Church. But that that is a
meeting of the congregation* with favor of the learned, cannot be proved
cogently; though I think excommunication when it is actually performed, it
should be done before the Congregation, but that is for the edification and
nearest and most immediate practice of that Congregation, for the contagion is
nearest to them, but the reason why the presence of the Congregation whereof
the Delinquent is a member is requisite, is not because this Congregation has
the sole intrinsecall power in her self; and because she only does formally
and antecedenter Excommunicate, and the rest of the Churches consequenter, and
by virtue of a communion: for the sister Churches are to debar this
excomunicate person from their communion with Christ in the Seals of the
Covenant, and that by an intrinsecall authoritative, and Church power, where as
if he were not excommunicated, they should have received him to a Communion
with them in the Seals, and that by an intrinsecall authoritative and Church
power, for one man cannot receive another to the Seals of the Covenant with
him; because no one man has a Church authority. If therefore the Church as the
Church is consociated by an intrinsecall Church Power should have admitted him,
if he had not been excommunicated, it is evident that he was a member not
only of the Congregation out of which he is excommunicated, but also of the
whole consociated congregations. 2, The man sins are bound on Earth
antecedenter, to all the consociated Churches. He is now equally incapable of
Church Fellowship in all the consociated Churches, as in that Congregation
whereof he is a member. All without and within that Congregation are to hold
him for no visible Saint; not to eat or drink with him, he is now to all the
visible Churches, in regard of visible communion, no member of that body
whereof Jesus Christ is head, no part of that City, of that building whereof
Christ is the Lord and chief cornerstone. And he is to the sister Churches in
their authoritative and Church-estimation (to speak so) and in relation to
their power of Jurisdiction, in the very same case a member of Satan, that he
is in relation to the authoritative power of Jurisdiction of that Congregation
whereof he was a nearest member; just as the finger cut off is alike separated
from the body, yea the whole body as from the hand; and it is a wonder to me
that Christ gives an intrinsecall power to a Congregation of twenty believers
to cut off a member, for the preservation of that little company of the Lords
Flock, and that he has denied that intrinserall power to the whole, which is
no less in danger to be infected, seeing Christ principally intends in the
giving of a Ministry to the whole Church, especially the gathering of the
whole body; To the full and perfect stature of the age of Christ, in the unity
of Faith, Ephesians. 4. 11. yet he intends the salvation and preservation of the
whole from infection more then the salvation of a part of this whole Body. That
is, as it you would say, the God of Nature has given an intrinsecall power to
five hundred in a City to set guides over themselves and to rule themselves by
wholesome Laws, but he has denied that power to the whole City consisting of
ten thousand; and he has given to the right hand an intrinsecall power to
consent that a finger in the right hand infected with a Gangrene, be cut off,
but he has denied this intrinsecall power to the whole man. I beseech you does
the God of Nature in conferring this power to the right Arm, intend the
preservation of the right Arm only, and its wellbeing, and not rather the
preservation of the whole body? so does not Christ intend that the whole
consociated Churches shall be preserved from infection, and not that particular
Congregation only? Then if Christ's means be congruously fitted for his own
end, he must have given an intrinsecall power to many consociated Churches to
cast out a contagious lump; other ways the consociated Churches are to
exercise the punishment of avoiding the Excommunicated person as an Heathen,
which flows from a power which is no ways in them; what conscience is here?
2. What if the Congregation cast the man out, clave errante, and undeservedly?
shall they, consequenter, as sister Churches, in a brutish fraternity execute a
sentence of a power intrinserall in another Church, and not any of them, or
their guides have any power to discern, whether the censure be justly or
unjustly infflicted? This our Brethren condemn in their own Congregation: for
because the reputing the ejected man an Heathen, is a matter of practice, that
concerns the conscience of every one of the Congregation, therefore must all
the Congregation give their powers and consent; yea do more then consent (say
some) even exercise jurisdiction, or a power not different from it. Some things
are objected against this way.

Ob. 1. The power of the Keys cannot be given to the catholic representative
Church, or catholic Presbytery, as to the first subject to be an ordinary and
constant mean of edification; The exercise whereof, in an ordinary and
constant way, is unpossible; But the exercise of this Ministerial power given
to the catholic visible Presbytery, as to the first subject, in an ordinary
and constant way, is unpossible; Ergo, such a power is not given to the
Catholic representative Church, as to the first subject, to be an ordinary and
constant mean of edification. The proposition is clear, it is uncongruous to
the Wisdom of Jesus Christ that he should give that to be a mean, which
possibly cannot attain the end. The Assumption is as evident; for the
Catholic visible Presbytery cannot meet in an ordinary and constant way.

Answ. 1. By distinguishing the Major proposition; That power of the Keys
remote cannot be given to the catholic presbytery as to the first subject, the
exercise whereof in an ordinary and constant way is impossile physically and ex
natura rei. True, but now the Assumption is false; That nearer power cannot be
given as a mean of edification, the exercise whereof is morally and through
the corruption of men's nature physically impossible. That is false, and denied,
and in either sense the conclusion cannot be true. 2. I grant the whole, and
yet nothing is concluded against us. For the power of the Keys is not given to
the catholic Presbytery as to the first subject, to be a mean of edification
in an ordinary and constant way; but only in an extraordinay and occasional
way, in those things which concern the power of jurisdiction belonging to the
whole Catholic Church. By ( extraordinary) here I mean not that which is
against a particular Law of God, and cannot be done without a Divine
dispensation of providence, but by ( extraordinary) I mean that which is raro
contingens, and does not often fall out; as almost it never falls out that the
universal Church has need to excommunicate a national Church, for all and
every one of a national Church do never fall away from the Faith. Yet a
remote power for Excommunication, is in the Catholic visible Church.

2. It is objected, if the visible catholic Church be the first and principal
subject of all Church Power, then a Presbyteriall Church cannot Excommunicate,
but by a power derived from the catholic visible presbytery, and so the
presbytery should ^^ excommunicate, but by consulting with the Catholic
visible Church, but this latter were impossible and absurd; Ergo, so must the
antecedent be. The counexion is proved thus; for as ^^ things have beat in so
far as they partake of the Fire; because heat is originally in the Fire, as
in the first subject, so all Churches exercising Excommunication must partake
of the power of censures, that is, first and principally in the original
subject, to wit, in the catholic visible Church. And it would seem that none
can use or put forthin acts, the power of the catholic Church visible,
without the conscience of the catholic Church visible.

Answ. This occasioneth me to speak somewhat of the power of the presbyteriall
and catholic Church. Hence I say. 1. With submission to the learned.

First, It is an hard way of arguing, to reason from the power to the several
exercises and diverse acts of the power. Our Brethren hold that all power of
the Keys, and all power Ministerial of preaching, administrating the Seals,
is originally in caetu sidelium, in a Church of Believers: but they cannot say
that therefore the acts of Preaching, administrating of the Sacraments and all
acts of jurisdiction can be exercised by the Believers, because they are the
first subject.

Secondly, the farther that the members, or Churches either Congregationall,
Presbyteriall, or National are removed in local distance, one from another;
the less is the visible and external communion of rebuking, comforting, and
admonishing one another; yet the power and obligation of these duties are not
removed. So though the National Churches be locally distant one from another,
yet their power of exercising duties, and so their power of Jurisdiction, in an
O^cumenicke Council, is not from thence concluded to be null. Yea, National
duties upon occasion are still obligatory^ and communion of men of sundry
Nations is clear to me, Esai. 2. 3. many Nations shall flow unto the
Mountain of the Lords House, Zach. 8. 23. Ten men shall take hold out of all
Languages of the Nations, they even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is
a Jew, saying, we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you. I
do not say, these Nations do meet all in one Synod, but the places do well
prove the power lawful of performing duties, whereas the exercise of them in
one place is not hic and nunc, in ordinary providence, possible. And so this
consequence must be weak; the whole catholic visible Churches in their
principal guides cannot ordinarily, and constantly meet, hic and nunc, for the
exercise of their power; Ergo, they have no such power. For if the power be
exercised in parts, which through occurrences of Providence, and the corruption
of men's nature cannot be exercised in whole, at once; yet its not hence evinced
to be a power not given of Christ for e^ification; for by our Brethrens grant
three thousand are added to the Congregationall Church of Jerusalem, Acts 2.
and to this Church of three thousand, and a hundred and twenty, Christ has
given the ordinary power of the Keys as to the first subject, though through
occurences of providence, and the corruption of man's nature, some of these,
suppose a thousand, through sickness, pest, danger of persecution, and sinful
separating from the assembly of Saints, could not hic and nunc meet in one
house, to exercise jointly all the acts of that power which our Brethren say is
given to them by Christ; they cannot say therefore Christ never gave to this
whole Church consisting of three thousand and a hundred and twenty, any such
power.

Thirdly, there is a great difference betwixt the power given ad esse
simplicter, to the being of a Church, and the power given ad been esse tantum,
only to the well-being. 2. Great difference also there is betwixt ordinary
power to be exercised constantly, and ordinarily, because of nearer
consociation of the Churches, in those things that concern that Church in
particular: suppose a presbyteriall or Congregationall Church, and a power to
be exercised, but more rarely, not ordinarily, because of the less communion
visible, and great local distance of Churches, as it falls out in the whole
visible Church. Now from this.

First, The ordinary power of Jurisdiction because of nearest vicinity, and
contiguity of members is given by Jesus Christ to one Congregation in an Isle.
1. Because that Church is a Church properly so called, though it be not a
perfect and complete Church. I say it is a Church properly so called, Because.
1. It is a little City, and a little Kingdom of Jesus Christ having within it
self power of the Word and Sacraments: and that is a Church and has the
essence of a Church to which agree the essential notes of a visible Church.
Now preaching of the Word and Administration of the Sacraments are essential
notes of a visible Church. But I say it is not a complete and perfect Church in
the latitude of visibility, (for Churches, are less or more visible, according
as they have less or more visible communion) for visible communion
constituteth a visible Church. Now a Congregation in a remote Island has a
less communion visible with other visible Churches, then conscciated visible
Churches have. 2. It is not complete and perfect in its operations, because in
case of doubts of conscience touching government and practice, and dogmaticall
points, it wants the joint authority, and power of Jurisdiction needful for
the well-being of a Church, which it should have, if it were consociated with
many other Congregations: so as we say an hand with five fingers is a
complete hand, but it is not a complete organicall body, but a part of the
organicall body of a man; so is a Congregation a Church wanting nothing of the
being and essence of a Church; yet is it incompleate, because it is a part or
member of a Presbyteriall Church, and not being consociated wants that which
belongs to the well being of a complete visible Church. For visibility of a
Church must have a latitude, because it is an accident or adjunct of an
organicall politic body, which is totum integrale.

Secondly, the ordinary power of ordinary Jurisdiction in a more perfect way,
because of ordinary and perfiter consociation, is given to the Presbyteriall
Church, as to the proper subject in the constant and ordinary exercise of
Discipline, because contignity being the foundation of visible external
government, the Presbyteriell Church of Jerusalem, Ephesus Corinth, Antioch,
and Rome, is a perfect complete consocia^d body. To which the power of
ordination, exauthoration, or deprivation of Pastors, of excommunication in a
constant and ordinary way does belong. For this is a principle of
Church-policy. Every politic body of Christ has power of Church government
within it self. But a Presbyteriall church is such. 2. This is a received
maxim also. Quod tangit omnes. ab omnibus, suo more, tractari debet. What
concerns all, should be agitated by all, according to their degrees of
concernment, but excom nunication of a person, in a consociated Church,
concerns all the consociated Churches in a Presbytery; all are scandalized,
all may be, and are in danger to be leavened with the infectious lump. And
here it is to be observed, that as preaching of the Word is an essential note
of the visible Church, and agreeing to the visible Church, as necessary ad esse
simpliciter, to the very being of a visible Church. For if the word as Preached
and some way promulgated be not in such a society, we cannot call it a visible
Church; so Discipline is a note of the visible Church, and necessary ad been
esse, and it cannot be a Ministerial Church in a good condition exercising
acts of edification, if the wall of Discipline be broken down: and meeting in
one place for Word and Sacraments is but accidental for a Ministerial Church.
If the Word be preached, and the Sacraments administrated in sundry
Congregations, though not in a Presbyteriall Church all convened in all its
members in one place, yet has the Presbyteriall Church the essential note of
a visible Church. Because there is a difference betwixt carrying the colors in
an Army tali modo, as all the Army at once may see the colors, and the
carrying of the colors. Yet the colors are a note visible of such an Army: so
there is a difference betwixt preaching the Word, simpliciter, and preaching
the Word, tali modo; in such a way in one material house only. And therefore
it is necessary that government which concerns many Churches consociated, be
in its exercise hic and nunc, larger then preaching of the Word in its
exercise, hic and nunc: which cannot be done, but to a multitude which
conveneth (...), to the same material place. And we see an act of government,
Acts 15. by confession of our Brethren, belonging to diverse consociated
Churches and performed by them, and yet these cannot ordinarily meet to one
and the same place in all their members for hearing of the Word.

Thirdly, an extraordinary, and remote power of Jurisdiction which is but
rarely and in extraordinary cases to be put forth in acts, is given to the
Catholic visible Presbytery of the whole Catholic visible Church. Because the
Oommunion external and visible is less, where the local distance of visible
Churches is more: and therefore because oecumenicall counsels, being necessary
for the Catholic visible Church, neque ad esse simpliciter, neque ad b^^e
esse, sed ad melius seu optimum esse, neither in respect of the Churches being,
nor in respect of the Churches well-being, ^u^ only in respect of her best and
most spiritual well-being, these counsels are seldom to be had in an
ordinary providence. For the Cresse of Jesus Christ is rather a mark of the
catholic visible Church, then Bellarmine his prospe^ous condition, that he
will have to be one of his fifteen notes of the Church: and since the Church
cannot have her wishes, the want of general counsels is the Catholic
Churches Cross, not her sin; we do not say that God is deficient in means
necessary to his Church, or to some of his own Children; because the Woman
has wings given her of God to stie to the Wilderness to hide her self from
the Dragon, Rev. 12. 14. and so cannot enjoy Gods ordinary presence, in his
Sanctuary. Nor do we say that God has denied a power to his Church in the
Wilderness, to enjoy them in a visible Sanctuary, I mean a moral power, and
jus, a right and interest in that presence, because he interrupteth the
Churches physical power, for a while, in the enjoying of these comforts of a
visible Church Communion, in the Sanctuary.

Fourthly, hence it does not follow, that because the catholic representative
visible Church is the first subject of the power of the Keys, that the power of
Excommunication is derived from the visible Church to a Presbyteriall Church,
or that a Presbyteriall Church cannot excommunicate without consulting with, or
fetching authority from the Catholic visible Church: Because the Catholic
visible Church is a great integrall body of Jesus Christ, and he is the head of
this body; because though the power of seeing by order of nature be first in
the whole man, and then in the Eye, yet the power of seeing in the Eye is not
derived from the rest of the body, from Hands, Legs, Shoulders, Arms, to the
Eye. The light is first in the whole Body of the Sun, as the first and prime
subject of light; yet supposing now the received opinion of Astronomers, that
the body of the Sun does exceed the quantity of the Earth an hundred sixty and
seven times, it does not follow that this or that part of the Sun has no light
intrinsecall in it; but that which is derived from the whole body of the Sun;
for then this or this part of the Sun should have borrowed light derived to it
from another: so the Soul does at one and the same instant, animate, and
quicken the whole organized Body as its first matter and subject, but it does
not follow that the Hand has life derived to it from the whole body: so
because the power of the Keys is also intrinsecall in the Presbytery, as in an
O^cumenicall council: it does not follow, that the power that is intrinsecall
in the presbytery is by derivation, or borrowed and at the second hand, from
the Catholic presbytery of the whole World; far less that the Presbytery
cannot Excommunicate, except it consult with the catholic visible Church. The
power of the Keys, by order of nature, is only in the catholic representative
Church as in the first subject, but in order of time this power is communicated
from the head Christ to all the integrall parts of this great Body according to
the capacity of every part, so as it is intrinsecall in the particular
Eldership of a single Congregation in these points of Discipline, that concern
a Congregation as a Congregation, and it is intrinsecall in the classical
Presbytery as it is such, and it is intrinsecall in the provincial, and
National Synod, in points belonging to them as such.

3. They object; if a single Congregation have not power of Excommunication,
and of entire and complete government within it self, because it is but a part
of a Presbyteriall Church, and so an incomplete Church: by that same reason a
Presbyteriall Church shall be a complete Church, and not have entire and
complete power of Government within it self; because a presbyteriall Church is
a part of a provincial Church, and a provincial Church shall be in the same
case, because it is a part of a National Church, and a National Church, in
that same case; because it is a part of the catholic visible Church, and there
shall be no perfect visible Church on Earth, which has full and entire power
of jurisdiction, save only the caholicke visible Church, which by no
possibility can convene, before her Oecunenick and highest catholic Court, a
National Church, or the Church of great Britain, and upon the testimony of
three witnesses deliver her to Satan, and upon supposall of Repentance receive
her again to the catholic power of that same Court; into fellowship of
Church-union with the great catholic body. For so because this catholic
Church, for many centuries, yea possibly for a million of years, cannot
convene to exercise her authority in a Court (and out of her Court she has
none) the repenting National Church, shall remain in Satan's bands for ever,
by a physical and invincible necessity.

Answ. A single Congregation is a Church, but so as it is a part also and a
member of a Presbyteriall Church, and because of neernesse of communion with
consociated Churches under one Presbytery; it can neither have complete power
of casting out one of its own members, because that member has so strict a
visible Union of membership also with consociated Churches, nor can it exercise
that intrinsecall power that it has as a remote part of Christ's Catholic
body, but the case for ordinary and constant power of ordinary and constant
Jurisdiction is not so in a Presbyteriall, in a provincial, in a National, in
the Catholic visible Body. And therefore it follows not that they are not
complete Bodies, and entire Churches for all ordinary and constant
Jurisdiction; and the reason is clear, because Synods or Synodicall Churches
above a Presbytery to me are not ordinary; not constant Courts, but
extraordinary, and prore nata occasional, having their rise from some
occurrence of providence, as is most clear, by Scripture. The Church of
Ephesus being a Presbyteriall Church, did constantly exercise Discipline, and
try false Prophets, and those which called themselves Jews, but were lievs,
Revel. 2. 2. Whereas that famous Council at Jerusalem was not an ordinary and
constant Court, but extraordinary, that is, occasional (for so I take the
Word, for expressions cause) and had its rise, Acts 15. 1. from a mere
occasion, because some came from Judea and taught the Brethren, except ye be
circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved, And the subject of
this Court was not the constant and ordinary affairs of Discipline, that
belonged to the presbytery of Jerusalem, and Antioch. No, v. 6. the subject was
only an incident controversy raised by false teachers, subverters of souls, v.
24. and therefore it is said, v. 6. The Apostles and Elders, (...), to consider
of this matter; therefore the presbyteriall Church has both Word and
Sacraments dispensed in it distributively through all the Churches, and for the
power of Jurisdiction ordinary intensive, and quoad essentiam Ecclesiae
ministerialis, according to the entire essence of a ministerial Church, it is
as perfect and complete in one single Congregation, as in a provincial, as in a
National, yea as in the Catholic visible Body, whereof Christ is the Head;
only a provincial, national, and the Catholic Church visible, extensive,
according to the power of extension, is a larger and a superior Church, and
though the presbyteriall Church be a part of the Catholic, it is so a part, as
it is a perfect whole Church: as a man is a part of this great all, the World,
yet so, as he is a perfect reasonable Creature, and so a whole man, and a part
of the World: but a Congregation is so a part of the Presbytery, that it has
not a whole, entire, complete intensive power over its own members to
excommunicate them, because its members are for contiguity and necessity of
near visible communion, parts that cannot avoid daily edifying or scandalizing
of consociated Churches, and therefore the consociated churches trust have a
power over the members of a Congregation. But our Brethren will say; Contiguity
of local cohabitation does not in be a visible Church, but only the voluntary
agreement of Professors who do, ex pacto, and by covenant tacit or express,
make up a conseciation: for a Papist and a Protestant may cohabit in one house.

Answ. That is true, but contiguity is such a necessary foundation of external
visible Church fellowship in one presbytery, as without that contiguity, I see
not how, jure Divino, there can be either a Congregationall Church, or any
other Church: for, sure I am, Christ has not ordained me to be a member of a
Congregation in America, or of a presbyteriall Church in Geneva. And that such
persons and no more be members of a Congregation, is not juris Divini, yet
without a contiguity less or more they cannot be members of a Congregation,
nor is this single Congregation a limb of this presbyteriall Church, jure
Divine; only this in abstracto is jus Divinum, that there be a Congregation of
a convenient number, and a presbytery of such as may meet conveniently in
their guides. But to return, the Brethren do deny that God gave a power of
Jurisdiction to the Catholic visible Court of the O^cumenick Church. And why?
because a general council cannot excommunicate, nor relax from
Excommunication a national Church, But I answer, 1. It is by accident, and not
through want of innate and intrinsecall power, that the Court of a Catholic
council cannot in an ordinary and constant way, exercise the power that Christ
has given to her, as the presbyteriall church does; and the exigence of
providence makes it so, because it falls out by the blessing of God, that
Zion must say, as it is, Esai. 49. 20. The place is too straight for me, give
place to me that I may dwell. And because she inlargeth the place of her Tent,
and stretches forth the curtains of her habitation, and lengthneth her cords,
and breaks forth on the right hand, and on the left, and her seed inheriteth
the Gentiles, Esai. 54. 2 3. and because from the rising of the Sun, to the
going d^^ne thereof, his Name is great amongst the Gentiles, and in every place
incense is offered to him, Mal. 1. 11. yet have general counsels condemned
Heretics, as Nestorians, Macedonians, Eutyches and others; and I see nothing
to prove that a general council has no power to excommunicate a National
Church. If the Lord should be pleased to give the Christian Churches a general
council this day, they might lawfully, in a juridicall way, declare the
faction of Romish pretended catholics, to be mystical Babylon, a cage of
unclean Birds, which is excommunication in the essence and substance of the
Act; nor is there need of a legal and juridicall citation of national
Churches, or a citation of witnesses to prove Romish Heresies, and perfidious
and detestable obstinacy: for their writings, and deeds, are so notorious, that
the senses of men may as infallibly prove the fact, as we know there is such a
City in the world as Rome, and C^n^tantinople; as for the instance that a
catholic council cannot ordinarily be had, to relax a repenting national
Church: I answer, the same inconvenience will follow, if we suppose an ordinary
case, the Church congregationall (as our Brethren suppose) of Jerusalem, Acts.
2. consisting of three thousand and a hundred and twenty, having excommunicated
Ananias, Saphira, and others, who yet by the grace of God, should truly
repent; in the mean time, the Sword of the Roman Emperor intervening
scatters this Church, that they cannot convene in a spiritual Court, to
relax them (and out of Court they have no authority of Jurisdiction) here were
an invincible necessity of their remaining in Satansbonds, in foro externo
ecclesiae. But what then? This is to limit God, as Papists do in binding and
tying salvation of Infants to the outward sign of external baptism; as if
God, in soro caeli, in his own Court could not absolve penitent sinners,
because the Church will not, which is more ordinary, through men's corruption,
or cannot absolve, through the necessity of exigence of divine providence: and
the more catholic that crosses be, as war^, the universal and catholic
cruelty, and treachery of the church of M^lignants against the true catholic
Church of Christ, the more easily are the Juridicall and Court-operations,
actions and proceedings of the catholic universal Church impedited. And
therefore this of our Saviors, tell the Church, is necessarily to be applied
to all Churches and Courts of Christ, even to a catholic council, though
Christ gave instances in an offended Brother, who is to tell the Church, But I
am sure, ( tell the church) is not to be restricted to a vocal and personal
complaining of one brother against another, in the face of a single
Congregation. For if the offense be committed before the Sun at noonday in the
seeing and hearing of the church, either congregationall, or presbyteriall, as
some may, and one do by word and writ openly blaspheme God: in this case
Christ's affirmative command, tell the church, does not in conscience oblige one
man to come and deal with the delinquent in private, and then (if he repent
not) before witnesses, and then to tell the church, so as one sins if he
tell not the church; for here Gods providence disposing of the notoriousnesse
and publicknes of the scandal does tell the church; and yet, I hope, our
Brethren could not deny, but this Text does w^^^^ that such a public offender
who scandalizeth many Churches should be excommunicated by this place, Mat. 18.
from which I gather the weakness of what is said for the independency of
churches from, Mat. 18.

Ob. 1. Here we cannot understand the Church universal. 1. Because he would
not say where two or three are gathered in my Name, I will be in the midst of
them, for two or three cannot represent all the Churches comprehended under the
catholic visible Body of Jesus Christ.
Ans. This is an argument from the less to the more. If I be present (would
our Savior say) where two or three, though they be but two or three: I will
far rather be present in the assemblies of the Church. Nor can the words stand
according to the letter strictly, according to our Brethrens mind, that two
should be a Church; for there should be Pastors and Elders, and Christian
witnesses, two at least, and the accused Brother here. 2. two or three, and
brother and brother are not to be taken as singular men only, but as two or
thee men, or Churches, who as they Abulensis ^u loc. etiam si non si^t (...).
may be offended. 1 Cor. 10 32. so may they give scandal and offense; so may
three, four, of consociated Congregations give the offense, and that
publicly; what? has Christ provided no remedy against scandals in his whole
Kingdom, but only for scandals fallen out in the single persons of a small
Congregation consisting of ten, 20 100. or 200. only when these little
congregations offend sister Congregations, they are left to the immediate
judgment of God? This is wonderful.

Ob. 2. The christian magistrate as a nursing father is to punish those who
offend, and has power to command Churches to confess offenses done to sister
Churches, and command Church censures, as excommunication, to be used, and
Christ's power to be put forth in practice, according to the will of Jesus
Christ.
Answ. Yet does it follow that the Apostolic Churches, and the succeeding
Churches to them under the ten bloody persecutions, when Magistrates were
enemies to Christ, and his church, that the Churches wanted spiritual means
to gain fallen and scandalous churches. 2. Christ has provided an
Ecclesiastical power to remove scandalls betwixt church and church; for the
Magistrates power is civil and put forth by the Sword, and by carnal weapons.
Christ's (...) in this, Mat. 18. 19. s to remove scandalls, and gain soales v.
15 for hear thee, thou o^st gained thy Brothe. The Sword of the Magistrate is
not ordained to gain so^les to Repentance. That (...) who cares for the part
of a visible church, does he not far rather care in a spiritual way, for the
whole? 3. What can the Magistrate command here? the Eldership of a Congregation
turn^^ Here^icks and scandalous to sister Churches and infecteth then. To^
Magistrate commadeth that Church censures be used (...) them as you say, who
should use them? not a sister Church (...) is offended. She has no power; not
the Eldership themselves offending. Christ never ordained that a church should
excommunicate her self; not the people; Who gave them power? And the major
part of them turns scandalous. Also Christ nere has left n^re ne^y. but let
them grow till Harvest, so say A^abaptists.

Ob. 3. Christ here speaks for a present and constant removing of scand (...)
Brother and Brother of one congregation. A cathalick (...) of the whole visible
Church is far off, and cannot be (...).
Answ. That he speaks of a present and constant remedy only, and of no remedy
against the scandal of whole Churches, is de^ed. He speaks of all remedies
to gain any offenders, persons or churches.

Ob. 4. Then should an universal council of the whole world be absolutely
necessary, if in some cases we must tell the whole catholickchurch
Ans. Neither does that follow general councels are neither necessary to the
being, nor to the well-being, but only to the best being of the catholic
church, and if the catholic church enjoyed its best-being to which it has
jus, and due right, that is, a perfect Reformation in doctrine and discipline,
then should general council be necessary for the keeping of this best being.
And this rule of Discipline given by Christ supposes a particular Congregation
right constituted (say our Brethren) else this rule cannot be necessarily kept.
So say we, that it may necessarily be kept in the catholic church, it
supposes the catholic church to be reformed; but Christ's church must sail
with a second wind, when she cannot have a first.

Ob. 5. Refusing communion with sister Churches in case of scand^ll is as
effectual a way for edification, as authoritative excommunication of
congregations by Presbyteries.
Answ. Excommunication of Congregations is a possible, not an ordinary
supposition; but our grounds proceed, when the members of one sister-church
offends another, if there be no presbyteriall power superi^r to both, that
may take order with them, then has not Christ, in the ordinary supposition of
ill administration of the Eldership of a particular Congregation, provided an
ecclesiastic way to remove scandalls out of His Kingdom. 2. non-communion is
no more then I may do to a brother who offends me. 2. it is not so
efficacious as a binding and loosing ratified in Heaven. 3. It has not that
special promise of Christ's church presence walking in the midst of the Golden
candle-sticks. 4. It is a secret condemning of the Wisdom of Christ in the
institution of excommunication, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 4. that some may learn not to blaspheme, 1 Timothy 1. 20. as if
excommunication which is a public authoritative mean were superfluous, if a
private and brotherly non-communion be sufficient, and as efficacious a mean
of edification, as Christ's mean.

Ob. 6. Either must you complain to a presbyteriall, provincial, and
national Church, before you complain to that congregation of which the
'Delinquent is a member, or after that you have complained to that
congregation; if the former be said, then you cannot tell the presbytery, or
superior Courts, but in case of obstinacy; for if you can gain a Brother, or a
Church in a private way, you are not to bring him to a more publickeshame, that
is contrary to Christ's order, v. 15. If he hear thee, thou have gained thy
brother. And if you tell it the Presbytery and the superior Courts, after you
have told it to the Church, whereof he is a member, then you make four steps,
in your reclaiming your brother, where Christ has made but three.
Ans. Christ's order according to the number of steps are three, when the fault
is private, scandalls of many Congregations cannot be private, and in public
scandalls we cannot go but to that church which the offense does immediately
concern; and if you make four steps or five according to your grounds, I see
no transgression; if 1. You admonish the offender. 2. Before two. 3. Before the
half of the Elders. 4. Before all the Elders, and. 5. If you be willing that
the Elders bring it to the hearing of the Congregation the number of three
precisely are not of positive Divine institution, they are only set down by
Christ to show we are to labor to gain our brother in private, before we
publish his shame to the Church; and if he commit the offense before two, I
think you need not tell him your self alone, but before two, and yet the
offense is private, if three only be privy to it; seeing it is not yet come to
the Church. 3. I much doubt if no faults be punishable by excommunication, but
only obstinacy: I think the (...) of incest, parricide and the like deserves
excommunication, though no contumacy be supervenient to such crimes.

Ob. 7. The Church spoken of, Mat. 18. is all one with the House of God, and
the House of Prayer, where two or three agree to pray for onething. v. 19. and
the place where worshipping is, and word and Sa^raments, that society in which
stewards give a portion of the trea^^ of life to every child of the House, Mat.
24. 45, 1 Cor. 4. 1. 2. (...) public Rebukes are tendered to these who sin
publicly, before all, that others may fear, 1 Timothy 5. 20. (...): this must be
in the Churches hearing and before the Congregation meet for the Word and
Sacraments, for these ordinances of God work for the edifying both of the
party reproved and before all the Congregation, which shall hear and fear;
and they work upon the Heart, as the Word of God does: now a presbyteriall
Church convened in some Elders of diverse Congregations, for Church censures and
exercise of jurisdiction, is not such a House of God, where are the Word,
Sacraments and public rebukes in the hearing of the Congregation; for the
Congregations of all the presbytery being 20. or 30. cannot meet in one Church.
Answ. That only a Congregation and not the catholic Church is the House of
God, I judge, the Word of God cannot teach; as Esai. 56. 5. To them will I give
a name within my House. What a name? to be a member of a single Congregation?
No, but of a whole visible Church, opposed to the condition of Eu^uches and
strangers, v. 4. that were not of the people of God. Cant. 1. 17 Ainsworth an.
in can. 3.

Cotton expo. on Cant. 3. 4.

Alst. in loc. quod ^rat veluti conclave Ecclesi^ Catholicae.


The beams of our House are cedars, this is the catholic Church and Spouse of
Christ, Cant. 3 4. I would not let Him go, till I brought Him to my Mothers
House, not a Congregation, but Jerusalem, (says Ainsworth) the Mother of us
all, Cotton, the Catholic Church; Alstedius, Jerusalem, Heb. 3. 2. as Moses
was faithful in all his House. Not a single congregation. 2. This Church here
is formally a Ministerial Church meeting to bind and loose, and excommunicate.
Nor is there need to expound it of an House of praying congregationally, but
rather 2. 19. of ligatory and authoritative prayers of the Presbytery. 3. Nor
is rebuking in a Congregation for the edifying of the hearers, any thing but
the execution of the judicial sentence of a Presbyteriall Church, which we
grant may be done in the congregation, whereof the Delinquent is a member, and
yet the Church here shall not signify a congregation convened for the Word and
S^crame^ts, except you say, all the people must necessarily be present, yea and
authoritative actors to bind and loose, as this Church is expressly called, v.
18. for if the place speak, 1 Timothy 5. 20. of concionall rebuking; then it
proves nothing, that is done by Timothy as a Pastor, virtute potest at is
ordinis, and not by the Presbytery, as an act of jurisdiction which is done by
the Church, not by one man, if it be meant of juridicall rebuking that is done
in a Court, where all the congregation are not present; or if it be done before
the congregation in Name of the Presbytery, what is done before the Church
(...) before many is not done by those many, as if they were the Church, which
our Savior bids us tell, and sure nothing i^ here against us.

Ob. 8. The Word Church is never used in the New Testament, for the Presbytery;
and if it signify a Representative Church; the meaning of this, the Angel of
the Church of Pergamus might be the Angel of the Church of Pergamus; for the
Representative Church is the Eldership of that Church.
Answ. This being the first time that Christ spoke of the Church (which the
Hebrews or Jews who knew his language, behoved to understand) he could not
mean any thing but a representative Church, not the common multitude; and
though it were taken other ways in all Scriptures beside, here it must have
this meaning; because he speakth of a court. If he heart not the Church etc, 2
Of a company who binds and loses on Earth. 3. Whose sentence is ^atified in
Heaven. 4. Binding and loosing are words of highest royal judicial authority
in Scripture, Psalm. 105. 20. The King sent and loosed him. 21. He made him Lord
over his House, v. 22. to bind his Princes at his pleasure, Psalm. 148. 8. To
bind their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of Iron. v. 9. To
execute upon them the judgment written, Mat. 22. 13. Take him and bind him;
Paul's being in bands, is to be under the Judges power, Acts 12 6. Peter was
bound with two chains; So the Captain of the Guard, J^r. 40. 4. and now be
hold I loose thee this day from thy chains. 2. The representative Church is
not called the Elders of the representative Church, nor the Angel of the
representative Church, but of the collective Church: and therefore there is no
Angel of a Church, of a Church here.

Ob. 9. From the Church here spoken of, their is no appeal, because the
sentence is ratified in Heaven. 2. It inflicteth the highest punishment, the
censure of excommunication, and a higher judicature can do no more. 3. Their
is no reason to appeal to a higher judicature, because the inferior may err,
because all above a Congregation are Courts which may err: for Presbyteries,
Provincial, National, the universal council of the Catholic Church may
err. So Mr. Mather.
Answ. This is no reason why we may not appeal from a M. Mather and Mr.
Tom^on in Ans. to Mr. He^le. c. 2. p. 13. 14.
Congregation, because the sentence is ratified in Heaven, because the sentence
of an inferior Judge proceeding rightly is ratified in Heaven; yet we may
appeal from him: to appeal is but upon fears of ill administration to desert
a lower Court, and go to a higher Court, so when we fear a counsel and advice
given by a sister Church to be not according to the Word of God, which yet is
according to the Word of God, upon the supposall of that fear we decline that
counsel, and take another. Neither are we to appeal, de jure, from a just
sentence in a presbytery. Illud possumus quod jure possumus. What the inferior
Sanedrim of Israel did justly, was ratified in Heaven: yet by Gods Law there
might be an appeal from it to the highest Sanedrim. 2. Nor is this a good
reason that we may not appeal from a Judicature which may inflict the highest
censure; for inferior Judicatures in Israel had power of life and death, yet
might man appeal from them. 3. The cause of appeals is not because inferior
Judicature^ may err, for so we might appeal from all judicatures, even from
a general council, for it may err. But the true cause is. 1. Because rarius
errant, they do not so frequently err. 2. They are not so inclined and
disposed to err, for many Eyes see more then one, and many Eyes do more
seldom miscarry in not taking up the right object then one. 3. Because we
conceive more equality and less partiality in higher Courts.

Ob. 10. You grant that a single Congregation in an Island has power
intrinsecall of Excommunication within it self; Ergo, the inconvenient which
you put on independent Congregations, shall follow in the case of a remote
congregation, Christ has not then provided sufficiently for that Church in
that case.
Answ. It follows only; Ergo, Christ has not provided so sufficiently for
that Church as for others in a consociation, which is nothing against us. For
woe to him that is alone, and two are better then one.

Ob. 11. If the Church here be a representative Church, the^ it has power from
those whom they represent, but they represent the people, and so the power is
first in the people, and the people must be the first visible Church, not the
presbytery, not a general council. I prove the major, because the power the
representer has that must be first in the represented.
Answ. A representer stands for another either objectively or subjectively.
What ever represents another objectively, that is, does such a business for
another, or in remejus, for his behalf and good, though he some way represent
that other, yet has he not his power from that which he represents; as the
Eye objectively in seeing, and the Ear in hearing represents the body, for
the Eye sees for the whole body, the Ear hears for the whole body. But the
eye has not its visi^e, or seeing faculty from the body, nor the Ear the
hearing faculty from the body. Now the Presbytery does represent the people
only objectively, that is, for the good and salvation of the people, and so
the Elders have not all their power of ruling from the people, but from Jesus
Christ. That which represents another subjectively has indeed its power from
that which it represents, as he who carries the person and room of a King
as an Ambassador, does fetch his power from the King, and that power is more
principally in the King. But now the Assumption is false, because the Eldership
does not represent the people, in their power of Jurisdiction, subjectively, as
standing in the place of the people, but as the Ambassadors of Christ, and as
stewards they have both the Keys from Christ, not from the people, and do
actually use the Keys, in his Name and authority, not in the peoples name and
authority. Hence is easily answered that Delegatus seu deputatus non potest
facere delegatum; one delegate cannot transfer his power to another delegate,
that would bring a progress infinite in government; for one deligate standing
in the room of others, sibjectively cannot transfer his whole power to
another, its true; he cannot transfer his power in part and according to some
singular acts, it is false: for Acts 15. 25. It is said by the council, It
seemed good unto us with one accord, to send chosen men to you, with Paul and
Silar. Paul and Silas and these chosen men, suppose six or ten are in this
Embassage, are but the deputies and Messengers of the council, and yet they
do agree to make Paul their deputy, and mouth to speak for them all, seeing
order requires that six at once should not speak, in this case Paul speaking
the mind of all the rest, in this singular act, he is a deputy of Deputies,
and he represents the whole six, who were Messengers of the Church sent with
the Epistle, and these six were Deputies and Messengers of the council, but as
these six Messengers sent by the council could not lay their whole power on
another to carry the Epistle to the Church of Antioch, and bestow their labors
elsewhere, nor could one of these six deligates, being chosen as deligate to
speak for the rest, put that power of speaking the mind of the whole six off
himself to another; in which sense, one deligate cannot make another, one
Messenger cannot send another; so the Presbyteriall or classical Court
convened as the deligates of the whole Congregations under them, or rather
deligates for them, then of them, decerning that one of a Congregation should
be excommunicated, may deligate one in that Congregation to pronounce the
sentence, and this one pronouncing the sentence as the deligate, and Messenger
of the Church is a deligate and a deputy of deligates, and deputies, in one
particular act; and this our Brethren in their own Church-sentences pronounced
by one Elder, must also say.

Object. 12. That nearest Church to whom we delate the offense of one single
offender, is a single Congregation, else we must over-leap this Church, and
tell the Presbytery, contrary to Christ's direction; but if he hear not that
very Church to whom we tell the business, he is excommunicated by that nearest
Church, as the words bear; Ergo, that nearest Church being single
congregations, may excommunicate, and so it is the first Church, and the
Presbyterial Church is not the first Church.
Ans. That nearest Church to whom we delate the offense of the delinquent;
first, in the case of wilful obstinacy; secondly, in the case of consociation
of Churches (whom the obstinacy concerns) is not a congregationall Church,
having power of Jurisdiction entirely and completely, to whom we must tell the
offense, which is the subject of excommuncation. The whole ministerial Church
is that particular Church, together with the Presbytery; and my reason is,
there is a Church, Acts 2. consisting of one and thirty hundred and twenty, all
called one Church. Now it is said of this Church that they continued, verse. 42.
steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread,
and prayer; but where did they meet? verse. 46. not only in the Temple, but
daily from house to house. This whole number has had v. 42. one
Church Fellowship, one Word, one Supper of the Lord; but in one meeting at
once? No, but they met from house to house, that is, in any private house, as
the phrase is here, (...), and Acts 20. 20. (...). Now it is clear there were
Congregations and Churches, when Word and Sacraments were in private houses at
Jerusalem, and from house to house in Ephesus; but I hope these were but parts
of the Church at Jerusalem and Ephesus, and that they could not meet all in one
house. If one therefore complain of a scandalous person to the Church of
Ephesus convened in a house, possibly in an upper Chamber, or elsewhere, this
is a meeting that continues in prayer and breaking of bread, and so has power
of Church Censures to admonish and rebuke, which things belong to that single
Congregation or Church in a private house; but it has not power to censure
those that offend the consociated Congregations that meet also (...), in
houses, that is, to excommunicate; and therefore he must complain to the
Elders of Ephesus, ^o^ we are not to think that the false Jews who were
censured by the Apostles of Ephesus, Rev^^. 2. 2. did only infest houses, or
one Congregation meet in a house, or that one House-Church, or
House-Congregation of Ephesus, did try and censure those that called themselves
Jews, Revel. 2, 2 but Christ gives the praise of this to the whole Church of
Ephesus, who had the power of censures. But it may be said, Ascandalous person
may infect two Congregations of two neighboring Presbyteries, he dwelling
near the borders of both: Ergo, if he be to be excommunicated, not by a
Congregation only, but by the Presbytery, because ^e may leaven many
consociated Churches; this man is not to be excommunicated, except you tell two
Presbyteriall Churches, and so a whole Province; and if he dwell in the borders
of two Nations, betwixt England and Scotland, he may leaven two parts of two
National Churches; and if the matter concerns both the National Churches, a
higher Church then a Presbytery, to wit a Church made up of two Presbyteries,
yea, of parts of two Presbyteries of two Nations, must by divine institution be
that Church complete and entire to which we must complain, and which has the
power of excommunication. Answ. It is certain, as the local limits of a
Congregation and the number is not properly of divine institution, only a
convenient number there must be to make up a Congregation; and suppose a man do
dwell in the borders of two Congregations, where he is equally distant from the
place of meeting of these two Congregations, it is not of divine institution
whether he be a member of the one or the other; yet where his parents did
willingly associate themselves to such a Congregation, or he himself did
associate himself, and where he received Baptism, he has now a relation to
that Church as a member thereof, and that Pastor is his Pastor, not any other,
as the Elders of the Church of Ephesus (suppose it were one single
Congregation) and the Angel of Ephesus is not the Angel of Thyatira; the
Angel of Pergamus is not to be called the Angel of Sard^s. So i^ the matter
in a Presbytery, or two Presbyteries of two distinct Nations (I mean now a
classical Presbytery) therefore these do make Presbyteries, 1. A convenient
number of Churches may be governed by one College, or society of Elders. 2.
Having ordinary conversing one with another. 3. Voluntarily upon these two
grounds combining themselves in one society; and upon these three the
supervenient institution of Christ is grounded. And therefore though it be
true, that one dwelling in the borders of two Congregations, of two classical
Presbyteries of two Nations, may equally infect other, and so ex natura rei,
and in reality of truth he may leaven both; yet the God of order having made
him a combined member now by institution of one Presbyteriall Church, not of
the other, he is to be excommunicated by the one, not by the other: For though
local distinction of Congregations and Presbyteries be not of divine
institution; yet supposing consideration be had to, first, a competent number
which may be edified; secondly, to ordinary conversing; thirdly, to voluntary
combination, either formal, as at the first molding of Congregations and
Presbyteries, or tacit and vertuall combination, as in after tracts of time.
Gods institution makes a relation of a particular membership of this man, so
to this Congregation or Presbytery; as that now upon their foresaid
suppositions, though he may leaven the neighboring Presbyteries or
Congregations, no less then those whereof he is a member, yet may he be
censured by those and none others now, in respect of Christ's ordinance applied
to this Presbyteriall Church in this place, and in this Nation, and not in this.

Object. 13. If the Congregation may admonish and rebuke, then may they
excommunicate, for you may not distinguish where the Law of God distinguishes
not: for there is no reason why this or this exercise of jurisdiction should be
given them, and not the exercise of all.
Answ. The Law clearly differenceth, Matthew. 18. I may rebuke and convince my
brother with the consent of three witnesses, which is some degree of
Church-censure, especially if a Pastor rebuke before three, yet may not a
Pastor excommunicate; the Church does that. 2. We acknowledge that a
Congregation may exercise all jurisdiction in re propria; but excommunication,
where Churches are consociated, is not a thing that is proper to a
Congregation, but concerns many.

Obj. 14. We do not think that the Church, Math. 18. 16. is the community its
alone, nor the Elders there alone; but the Elders in presence of the community.
For even Act. 15. when the Apostles and Elders did give out decrees, they did
it before the Church of Jerusalem, and in their presence, V. 22. Then pleased
it the Apostles, Elders, and whole Church, to send chosen men to Antioch. For
show us a warrant in the Word, where the Elders there alone did exercise
jurisdiction, the people not being convened, and where such a company of Elders
there alone is called a Church. The Judges in Israel judged in the gates before
the people; the Elders judged in, or, before the Church, as the eye sees
united to the head, not separated from it.
Answ. Nor do we exclude these from hearing the Elders exercise jurisdiction,
if the matter concern them; but we ask if the whole people of Israel were
obliged by virtue of Divine Institution to be present in the gates of the City
when the Judges did sit there, and judge, as our brethren therein say; by a
Divine Institution the people are to be present, and to consent; yea and have
an honor above consenting, (say they) so as, if the people be not there to
have their share of excommunication in their way, then is Christ's order
violated, because the Church cannot be said to excommunicate and bind and loose
on Earth; whereas the Elders only, without the people, do only bind and loose,
and excommunicate; and the Elders (say they) without the people are not the
Church, nor can be called the Church, and so the acts of the Elders, judging,
and separated from the people are null, because not acts of the Church; seeing
the alone Elders are not the Church; and by this reason the Judges could not
judge in Israel, except all Israel had been present to consent, for all Israel
are bidden to execute judgment in the morning, both the Rulers and people. 2.
All the thousands in Jerusalem which made up many Congregations, Isa. 1. 10.
16, 17
were not, nor could they, and the whole Congreations of A^tioch, Syria, and
Silicia, who were all concerned in conscience no less then Jerusalem, be
present, and that by obligation of a Divine Institution: and therefore that
Church, and that whole Church, Act. 15. 22. can be no other then the whole
representative Church. And so we say, both here and Act. 15. the Church
representative exercises jurisdiction without the people; if people were
present, it was by virtue of no Divine Institution: so as if they had not been
present the decrees could not have been called the decrees of the Church: and
certainly the comparison of the eye which sees not but as united to the body,
if it be strictly urged, may well prove that the Elders, if the people be not
present, even all and every one whom it concerns, c^^ no more exercise
jurisdiction, or decerne that a scandalous person can be excommunicated, then
an eye can see when it is plucked out of the head.

Object. 15. Divines bring an argument from Math. 18. by ^^^logy and proportion
from particular congregations, to prove Na^i^nall and general Synods of the
whole Christian world. Ergo, they suppose that a particular Church is the
measure and pattern, and first Church which has power of excommunication,
Answ. Parker, and some few enclining to our brethrens mind do so, but Divines
understand by a Church a Presbyteriall Church, which they make the measure and
pattern of Assemblies.

Object. 16 Here is a particular Church, because here is an offended brother
who is a member thereof. This particular Church has Elders, this particular
Church is a whole Church, 1 Cor. 14. if the whole Church come together. Jam. 5.
Send for the Elders of the Church. It cannot be, that the sick^ person is to
send for the Elders of a Presbyteriall Church that are so far removed from
the sick man.
Answ. An hand with five fingers is a whole hand, but not a whole body; a
Congregation is a whole Church in its own kind, whole for those things that
concern it self, but not whole and complete for all jurisdiction. If James
should bid, send for all the Elders, this consequence should have some color.

Object. 17. A Presbyteriall Church can be an offending Church, but this, Math.
18. is for an offending brother, if thy brother sin against thee, etc.
Answ. Christ gives an instance only in an offending brother, but the
doctrine is for the curing of an offending Church also, for all persons to be
gained, Thou have gained thy brother. We are to gain Churches even as we are
not to offend Churches, 1 Cor. 10. 32.

Object. 18* There are no Church Censures meant here, Christ's scope is to
resolve a case of conscience, how far we are to go on with an offending
brother before we behave our selves to him as to an heather. ^, It is said, if
thy brother sin against thee, Ergo, it is a private offense, not a public
Church-scandall, that deserves excommunication.
Answ. Christ's purpose is to show how we may gain to repentance an offending
brother, Thou have gained thy brother. And he will have us use both public
and private means to gain him. 2. It is such a sin as must be told to the
Church, when obstinacy to the Church is added, and therefore at length it is a
public scandal and so deserves excommunication.

Ob. 2. Reprove him, that is, convince him, but is it not reproving to be
brought before the Church? must I reprove every one who offends me, even the
King? it is a man's glory to pass by an offense; and Solomon for bids us to
over-heare our servant cursing us.
Answ. God has made every man his brothers keeper, and we are not to suffer
sin in our brother, but in any case to rebuke him, Lev. 19, 17. the King is not
every man's brother whom he is to use familiarly, as the brother meant of here;
though Kings should be rebuked by their Nobles, and by Pastors. 2. We are to
pass over offenses, that is, to forgive those that sin against us, and not to
be too curious to know who reproacheth us, as Salomons meaning is to be taken,
and to be willing to forgive, and yet to labor to gain our brother by
rebukes; one act of love fights not with another.

Ob. 3. Tell the Church, is not meant of a Christian Church, but he speaks of
a thing present, but there was no Christian Church as yet.
Answ. It follows not, it is a rule especially for time to come, though
Christ speak after this manner, as if it were a thing present.

Ob. 4. It is not much that the word, Church, signifies only in this place a
company of godly men, witnesses of the man's offense; for (...) signifies only
once, Joh. 3. the wind. 2. Christ spoke in the Syriak and Gnedah, Psalm. 22.
Gnedah a company, or many Bulls have comp^ss^d m^, 1 San. 19. a company of
Prophets, Gnedah. The meaning is, if he be not convinced by the testimony of
two, rebuke him before many.
Answ. It is not like, that seeing in the Chapter preceding he s^ake of the
Church, as of a company to whom the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven were given,
and that here he speaking of a Church which has authoritative power to bind
and loose, that Christ has any such ^nsolent meaning of the word Church, as
only to note many Christians. 2. The Syriak is not the Original, but the
Greek.

Ob. 5. The witnesses sp^ken of here are not witnesses of the offenses, but of
the reproof, and therefore there is nothing here of a judicial proc^s.
Answ. Yea, but these witnesses are witnesses both of the reproote, and of that
obstinacy, for the which the man's sins are bound in Heaven.

Ob. 6. Let him be to thee as an Heathen. He says not, let him be to the C^urt
as an Heathen, and therefore here is no shadow of any Court.
Ans. It is an ordinary hebraisme, when the second person is put for the third,
especially in Laws, as, Thou shall not send him away empty. Also, Thine eye
shall not spare him. Also, Then shall out away evil out of Israel. And
therefore here is a real Court, it the context be considered. Christ speaks
so, Let him be to thee as an Heathen; in opposition to that which he was called
to be, for his obstinacy; to wit, a brother, if thy brother offend. And how
weak is this? Let him be to thee as an Heathen. Ergo, He should not be to the
Church as an Heathen. The contrary consequence is most necessary, if he be to
thee as an Heathen, because he is now convinced of obstinacy before two
brethren, and before all the Church. Ergo, these two brethren and the whole
Church are to count him as an Heathen, for the offended brother has gone along
all the way in the unanimous judgment, and a consort of mind, with both the
witnesses and the Church; Ergo, this obstinate man is the same to the Church
that he is to the offended brother, that is, he is to both as an Heathen and a
Publican, and both are to abstain from eating or brotherly conve si^g with
him, as the Jews would not familiarly converse with the heathen, and as Paul
commands 1 Cor. 5. 10, 11. that with an excommunicated man, we are not to
eat.

Ob. 7. Whatsoever you bind on earth, is in good sense, that he who offends
any little one that believes, his sin is bound in Heaven, as the friends of
Job c. 42. were not accepted of God, till they made their peace first with Job,
yet Job had no power of the Keys over his friends, and an offering is not
accepted, while first the offerer be reconciled to his broth^r, and so his
sins are bound in Heaven, and yet one brother has not a jurisdiction over
another.
Answ. Binding and loosing in this, Chap. 18. must be the same with binding and
loosing, Chap. 16. 19. but expressly their binding and loosing is by the Church.
power of the Keys, and is all one with that authoritative power of remitting
and retaining sins (...). 20. 21, 22 23. and in Scripture the keys, and
binding, and loosing, are never ascribed but to Stewards, Officers, Princes,
and Judges, who have power of jurisdiction, as I have proved already; and
therefore that which is spoken of Jobs friends, and of the offerer not
reconciled to his brother, Come not up to the point, for Jobs friends do not
bind on earth, and the offended brother is a more private man destitute of the
keys, and of all power of j^risdiction.

It is first objected by our reverend brethren, The extent of the power of
jurisdiction in the Elders of a classical Presbytery must be proved by Gods
Word, which cannot be.

For if many classical Elders have power over many Congregations, possibly
twenty or thirty Churches, then they bear the relation of Elders to these
thirty Congregations, and they must all be Elders of these Churches, as the
Scripture says, the Elders of Ephesus, the Angel of the Church of Pergamus,
the Angel of the Church of Thyatira; now this cannot be: for then, First,
Deacons must be Deacons of many Congregations, and Deacons might meet in one
College to dispose of the Treasury of these thirty, and yet these thirty
Churches should not be consulted with, nor could they all convene in one to
give their consent and judgment concerning their Treasury. Now though Deacons
be inferior to Pastors, yet are they no l^sse Officers in their own sphere,
having power, then the Pastors; and Paul writing to the Church of Philippi,
writes to the Deacons as to the Bishops, insi^uating that Deacons are Deacons
in relation to that Church, no less then Pastors.

Answ. I deny the Proposition, to wit, If many Elders be one Presbytery ruling
many Congregations, then do they bear the relation of Elders to these many
Congregations, as proper Pastors to every Congregation, of, or within that
Presbyteriall Church: nor do they bear that relation of watchmen and proper
Pastors to every one of these Congregations, that a Pastor of a particular
Congregation bears to his particular flock, that is to be ^oved. It is true
they are called the Elders of the presbyteriall Church of Ephesus, the College
of the Angels of the Church of Pergamus; but this is a general and different
relation from that which each Pastor, does carry to his own flock in those
respects. 1. The Presbytery are Elders to the classical Church (...) ^^; not
in things proper to each Congregation but in things common to all, or in that
which is the proper object of government, to wit, those things which rather
concern the consociation, and combination of those thirty Churches then the
thirty consociated, and combined Churches in particular. 2. The Presbytery does
rather take care of the reg^lation of the acts of governing in all these
Churches, then the governed Churches: for they are to heed to the Pastors
ordained, and to lay h^nds suddenly on no man, to commit the Word to faithful
m^n, to see that Pastors preach sound Doctrine, and exercise Discipline
according to the rule, but they do not feed as special Pastors the
particular flocks, but every one is to feed his own flock over the which the
Holy Ghost has set him, Acts 20, 28. 3 The Elders of the classical presbytery
are Elders to all these Churches, as the Elders themselves are, in Collegio
Presbyteriali, in the College of Presbyters and properly as they are in the
Court, but not separatim, and oct of Court, so this and this Archippus is not
an Elder, or Pastor to all these Congregations, so as he has to answer to God
and to watch for the Souls of them all, but he has a charge of them only in
Collegio; and if he do any thing, as a classical Elder, as if he lay hands
on a Pastor ordained to be the Pastor of such a Congregation, he does it as
the hand and instrument and deligate of the Presbytery, or if he pronounce the
sentence of excommunication in a Congregation, he is virtualiter in Collegio,
when he does that act, in respect he does it as the deligate of the Presbytery.
And this our Brethren may see in their own particular Eldership of their
independent flock, if an Elder occasionally rebuke any of the flock, never
convened before the Church, he does not in that exercise an act of Church
Jurisdiction, because he is not now in a Court, and when he is not in the
Court he cannot excommun^cate, Yet ^iting in Court he does, in Collegio, with
the rest of the Eldership exercise Church Jurisdiction. And separatim, and not
joined in the Court they cannot exercise Church Jurisdiction. 2. The presbytery
has a Church-Relation to all these 30. Churches not taken distributively, but
collectively as all those are united in one Church classical under one
external and visible government, even as the Elders of an independent Church
are not Elders of their single Congregation, being separated from their Court,
and extra coll^gium Presbyteriale, in the notion of the relation of a
Church-Jurisdiction, for they are Elders by reason of Church Jurisdiction only
in their Court. 3. Classical Elders in the Court have power of Jurisdiction in
relation to this presbyteriall, or classiciall Church, but they have not
properly an ordinary power of order to preach to them all and every one, and to
administrate the Sacraments to them. The Elders of a particular Congregation,
have power of order and power of Jurisdiction without the Court, but they have
not power of Church jurisdiction, but in the Court; for there is a difference
betwixt a power of jurisdiction which Elders have as Watchmen, and a power of
Church-Jurisdiction which Elders have not but in foro Ecclesiae, in the Court
of Church-Jurisdiction. So the great Sanedrim bear rule over all the Tribes of
Israel. But this Judge of the Tribe of Dan a member of the Sanedrim is not a
Judge of the Tribe of Benjamin, or a Judge to a thousand of that Tribe, as the
Captain of that thousand. 2. I distinguish the proposition, if the Elders of
the Presbytery be Elders of the Presbyteriall Church, then are they Elders in
relation to the many Congregations in that Church, if they be Elders in these
common affairs which concern government in general, then are they Elders in
feeding, by the word of knowledge, and in governing in all the particulars
which concern the government of each Congregation. That I deny, for their
oversight in governing in things belonging to all the consociated Churches,
does not make them Elders of all those particular Congregations. 3. Deacons in
some cases are also Deacons in relation to all the particular Churches in some
reserved cases: if all the Deacons of Macedonia, Corinth and other Churches,
should meet in one and take course for supplying the distressed Saines at
Jerusalem, what inconvenient were in this?

Ob. 2. If Presbyteriall Elders be Elders to mary Congregations in a general
Relation, what sort of Elders are they? are they Elders ruling, or are they
Elders teaching? it is unpossible that they can be Elders teaching, to so many
Congregations; for teaching is a personal and incommunicable act, that m^n
cannot commit to any others, they must perform it in their own persons, a^^
cannot commit it to others, if they be Ruling Elders only, and not teaching
Elders, this is against the Scripture; for the exten: of teaching and the
extent of ruling are commexsurable in the Word, and of alike extersion, Acts
20. 28. These same who are to feed the fl^ck at Eph^sue, are to govern and
rul^, and they are to feed the whole fl^ck^, not a part of it; so the Text
says, Take heed to the whole fl^cke, then they are not to govern all in a
presbytery, and to feed with teaching the Word, one particular Congregation
only; so 1 Pe^. 5. 2. feed the flock of God which is amongst you, not with
knowledge only, but be adds their duty of governing: Taking the oversight
thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, etc. So H^b. 13. 7. Remember them
that have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the Word of God; Ergo,
these same who have the rule over the flock, and govern, du also speak the
Word of the Lord and teach, v. 17. obey them that have the rule over you and
submit to them, for they watch for your souls as these who must give account;
Ergo, these same who govern, do also as Pastors watch for the flock, as those
that are to give an account; but the governing classical Presbytery do rule,
but it is unpossible that they can give an account for all the Congregations of
a classical Presbytery, for they cannot watch over them all, except every one
of these must have many Eyes: Nor can they be both ruling and teaching
Officers, for then they should have two Offices, if one man be both a Physician
and a Chyrurgion to two several companies, he must have two Offices in
relation to two charges which he has to those two companies, if he practice
physic to the one company, and chyrurgery to the other, this is against the
order that Paul Col. 2. rejoiced to behold. Therefore the classical Elders
cannot be Rulers having the oversight of the whole c^^ssicall Church, and yet
every one of them must be a (...) and teaching pastor only to the single
Congregation over which (...).

Answ. As Grandfathers and fathers do bear a relation to these same Children
diverse ways, both are fathers and may tutor and provide for the children, but
both are not begetting ^athers, so also do the classical Elders and the
Elders of particular Congregations, bear diverse relations to the flocks. the
question then is what sort of Elders are the Presbyteriall Elders to the
Presbyteriall Church? I distinguish Church, I distinguish Elders. They are
Elders classical only to the classical Church collectively taken, and they
have an authoritative care over this Church. But they are proper Elders to the
classical Church taken distributively, that is, this man is an Elder to this
part, or member of the Presbytery, to wit, to this Congregation. And another
man to this Congregation as the Elders; in the Court and Aslembly at Jerusalem,
Acts 15. they are Elders in relation to the whole Churches of Antioch, Syria,
and Silicia, and the Gentiles collectively taken in those dogmaticall points,
with the confession of our Brethren, and these same Elders were in special
manner Elders to the Congregations of Antioch, Syria and Silicia, and other
Churches taken distributively; so also the Elders of many consociated, and
Neighboring Churches are special watchmen over their own fl^cks, by teaching
and ruling, according to our Brethrens grounds, and also they have a Brotherly
care over all the consociated Church, to Council, ^dmonrth, Comfort; seeing
every man is his Brothers keeper, by a Divine Law, and the care is like as is
it were authoritative, only, by our Brethrens way, it wants the relation of
authority; vet does it not follow that Elders this way have two Offices. but
only that they perform two acts of one and the same Office; also a Pastor of
an independent flock, who writcth ^ B^^ke for the instruction of
Sister-Churches as he preache^^ those same Sermons that are in the printed
B^oke to his own people and flock, has two Relations, one to his own flock
whom he preaches unto. as a Pastor, another as an instructor of other
Churches by his writings, yet for that he has not two Offices, as one who is
a 'Physitian and a Chyrurgion to two sundry companies. if any say, he writteth
not Books as a Pastor, by virtue of his Office, but as a gifted man by power
of fraternity, let me deny the truth of the distinction, for this is to beg
what is in question; For to teach the Churches by writing should proceed from
the authoritative power of a Pastor, as a Pastor; and by that same official
power that he teaches his own flock viva voce, by vocal preaching, as a
Doctor he teaches other Churches by writing. But it was asked, whether are
the classical Elders ruling Elders, or Teaching Elders to the classical
Church?

Answ. They are both, and they are neither, in diverse considerations, they be
teaching Elders in all the Congregations, distributively taken, they are Rulers
in all collectively taken, they are Teachers (...), in some reserved acts,
resolving synodically some cases of conscience and dogmaticall points upon
occasion, but they be not the constant Teachers to watch for the Souls of all.
3. The places, Acts 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 2. Heb. 137. 17. prove that those that
rule in common many Churches should be Teachers of these same Churches
distributively, and all the Eldership at Ephesus should rule the whole Churches
amongst them. And there should no Pastor be a sole Ruler and not a Teacher, as
the Prelate is; nor is there a Pastor who is a sole Teacher, and it is very
true he who is a ruling Pastor is also a Teaching Pastor, but not to that same
flock always. Neither is this true, that because power of jurisdiction is
founded upon power of order, therefore teaching should be every way
commensurable with ruling; for 1. The Eldership convened in Court, and only
formaliter in foro Ecclesiae, in this Court has Church Power of Jurisdiction,
in a Congregation, and in this Court they govern, but the Eldership in this
Court neither does preach, nor can preach. 2. The power of ruling is in the
ruling Elder, but not the power of teaching, and the power of teaching
publicly is in the un^fficed Prophet, as our Brethren teach, and yet in him
there is no power of ruling.

Ob. 3. It is strange that to excommunicate agrees to the ruleing Elder in a
classical Presbytery, which he may do in many Congregations, and so he may
perform his principal acts over thirty or forty Congregations; and yet the
Pastor may not perform his principal act of teaching in many Congregations,
by virtue of his office, but only in one congregation, by this frame of a
classical Church.
Answ. The ruling Elder does only in some common cases with the presbytery
perform his special acts, but all the ordinary acts of the spiritual
Jurisdiction the ruling Elder performs in that Congregation whereof he is an
Elder, nor is this an inconvenient; but preaching which is given to unofficed
men by our Brethren, should not be called the principal part of a Pastors
charge.

Ob. 4. It is unreasonable that a Prelate or a Pope should rule me, and not
teach me, and we condemned this in Prelates that they would only rule, and not
teach: But the classical presbytery does fall in that same fault, for they
govern the whole classical Church, but they do not teach the whole
classical Church; It is dreadful for a man to watch for the souls of one
single Congregation, as being under necessity to give an accempt; Ergo, far
more dreadful it is to watch also for a whole tract of thirty or forty
Churches, the Apostle will have Him who watches for one flock to entangle
himself with no other employments. How then shall he take the burden of
thirty, or forty Flocks?
Answ. It is unreasonable that Prelate and Pope should rule me, and so many
hundred Churches 1. as the sole and proper Pastors, and all under them be but
suffragans and deputed Pastors, doing by borrowed authority from Pope and
Prelate. 2. That their sole Office should be to command feeders as Pastors of
pastors, and not to feed with knowledge the flock, that is most true; but the
classical presbyters are neither principal nor proper pastors of the whole
classical Churches collectively, nor are two or three pastors under them as
deputies. 3. Nor is their Office to rule only, not to feed with knowledge
also. 2. The pastors of independent flocks are obliged by brotherly
association, to be Vine-Keepers, Governors, fellow-Counsellers to forty
sister- Churches, for they acknowledge Ass^^tion of (...) ^. 19.
that Churches cannot subsist in good government without the help of Synods;
Now if we distinguish onerousn^sse, care, and labor of B^therly watching over
one another, and oner^u^n^sse, care, and labor, by way of Jurisdiction, the
former is as great in foro Dei, in the Court of Conscience as the latter, and
so ou^ Brethren make Governing without Teaching, as well as we do; They in a
Brotherly way, we in a way of Jurisdiction. I prove that their way is as
dreadful and labo^ous in the ^oynt of conscience, and in a way of giving
account to God, as our way. For 1. A divine command that we be our Brethrens
keepers, and we watch over one another commands onerousnesse, and care in
Brotherly governing to them, as to us. 2. We make the ground and foundation of
governing a Classical Church that band of Love and Union of the members of one
Body of Christ, and this band of Lovely and Brotherly consociation of many
Congregations commands, and ti^th us to do no more in Governing and i^
Helping, and promoting the edification of sister- Churches, then if we had no
further warrant to prom^te edification, then the alone relation of Brotherly
consociation, for the only and very reason why the Wisdom of our Lawgiver
Christ has put a special Commandment on consociated Churches to make one
Presbytery, and to govern one Classical Church, in these common points that
concern the whole Classical Church, in the point of sound Doctrine and
lawful and Ministerial Jurisdiction, is the necessity that Members of one
Body have of Broth^rly Help, Light, Direction, Comfort one of another. Which
point I desire carefully to be observed: for we see no ground to make the
powers of a Congregation, of a presbytery, of a Province. of a National
Church, powers formally and essentially different, they differ only in more or
less extension, as the adjunct or genuine property of one and the same great
visible Body, which is one integrall part; That same. 1. Covenant of God. 2.
That same Lord 3. That same Spirit. 4. That same Faith and Baptism. 5. That
same power of the Keys in Nature and Essence belongs to all; only the power
must be more or less, as the Body is more or less, as there is more of that
vis loc^motiva, the power of moving in the Hand then i^ one Finger, and in the
whole Arm then in the Hand only, and in the whole body then in the Hand. And
I clear it in this, a man is a gifted Preacher in a Congregation in an Island,
there is none other gifted of GOD to Preach the Gospel but he only. I would
think, as a Brother he were under as great an Obligation of care, and
laborious onerousnesse of conscience to bestow his Talent for the gaining of
Souls by preaching, though he were not called to be their Pastor, and that
by virtue of his Brotherly relation to the people, as if he were called to be
their Pastor. I desire to know what the naked relation of Authority, or
Jurisdiction adds to his care and onerousnesse in point of laboring by
preaching the Gospel. Indeed now being called, his care is Pastoral and more
authoritative. But if according to the measure of the Talent, every one is to
proportion his pains to gain more Talents to his Lord, and if the relation of
a Pastor add no degrees of gifts to His Talent, as we may suppose, I think
his onerousnesse in laboring was as great before he was a Pastor as after:
but I speak not this, to say that in a constituted Church there is no calling
required other then gifts. Nor do I speak this to say, that a calling is not
a new motive why a man should employ his gifts for the honor of the Giver; But
only to show that CHRIST has united powers of Jurisdiction in Congregations,
in Presbyteries, in Churches of Provinces and Nations; that so, not only gifts
might conduce to help and promove edification, but also united powers of
Jurisdiction which are also gifts of God, and though some may say that a
calling to an Office lays on M^n a more special Obligation, to make account
for Souls, then gifts only (which in some sense, I could also yield) yet
seeing we think the relation of the Eldership to a whole Classical Church is
not founded upon an Office different from the Offices of Pastors and Elders
which they have, and are clothed with in relation to their particular
Congregations, but only authoritative acts of the same Office, and that for
the common promoving of edification in the whole Classical Church, grounded in
the depth of his Wisdom who has seven Eyes, upon a Brotherly Consociation, in
which they must either edify one another, and occasionally partake of these
same holy things, or then scandaliz^ and leaven one another, with their
public transgressions; we cannot see how presbyteriall Elders are more to
give account for the Souls of the whole Classical Church in Scriptures sense,
Hebrews 13. 17. then consociated pastors and Elders of consociated Churches
are to give an account to GOD for sister Churches, over which they are to
watch, and whose Souls they are to keep, and so far as they are Brethren
must make a reckoning to GOD for them. And how can the presbytery be more said
to entangle themselves, in governing the Classical Church in some things, with
things not proper to their calling, seeing consociated Churches, in a Brotherly
way, do meddle with those same things, though not in a way of Jurisdiction? For
helping the Classical Church by way of Fraternity is not unproper to a
Christian calling of Brethren, and the joining of power of Jurisdiction; I
mean of power lesser to another power greater, to help the Classical Church,
upon the same ground of Fraternity, cannot be unproper to the calling of a
College of presbyters.

Objecti. 5. The power of Presbyteries takes away the power of a Congregation,
therefore it cannot be lawful. The antecedent is thus confirmed. 1. Because
if the Presbytery ordain^ one to be Excommunicated, whom the Elders of a
Congregation in conscience think ought not to be Excommunicated, the man,
Jure Divino, must be Excommunicated, and the power of the Congregation, which
Christ has given to them is null. And the exercise thereof impeded by a greater
power. 2. the voices of two Elders of a Congregation, which are now sitting in
the greater and classical Presbytery, are swallowed up by the greater number
of Elders, of thirty or forty Congregations met in one great presbytery; Ergo,
the power of the Congregation is not helped by the presbytery, but close taken
away.

Answ. The Argument does presuppose that which is against GODS Law, to wit. 1.
That there is a contradiction of Voices, betwixt the Elders of a Cong egation,
and of the greater presbytery; which should not be, for Brethren even of
Galathia, which contained many Congregations, as our Brethren confess, should
all mind and speak, and agree in one thing that belongs to Church
Discipline, as is clear, Gala. 1. 8. Gala. 5. 10 v. 15. Gala. 6. 1. 2. 2. The
Argument supposes that the greater presbytery is wrong in their voycing, that
such a man should be excommunicated, and the two Elders of the Congregationall
Church is right, and has the best part in judging that the same man ought not
to be Excommunicated. But Christ has given no power to any Church to err, and
that power which in this case the presbytery exercises is not of Christ; and
de jure, the power of the greater presbytery in this case ought to be
swallowed up of the two Voices of the Elders of the Congregation. But suppose
that the Elders of one Congregation, and the whole meeting all agree in the
truth of GOD, as they all do Acts 15. will you say that Peter, Paul, and James
their power is null, and taken from them; and their three voices are swallowed
up in that great convention, because to their power and voices are added, in
this dogmaticall determination (which you grant even now to many consociated
Churches) the power and voices of the rest of the Apostles and Elders; yea and
as some say, of the whole Church. Acts 15. 2, v. 6. 25. Acts 16. 4. Acts 21.
18. 25? I believe addition of lawful power does not annull lawful power, but
corroborate and strengthen it. So this shall fall upon your own Eldership of
your independent Congregation. Suppose ^en Pastors, Elders and Doctors in one
of your Congregations, whereas sometime there were but three, and these three
had the sole power of Jurisdiction and exercise of the Keys, you cannot say
that the accession of six Elders to three, has made null the power of three,
and swallowed up their voices; for if their power and voices were against the
truth, it is fit they should be swallowed up: if they were for CHRIST, they are
strengthened, by the accession of lawful power and more voices, and neither
annulled nor swallowed up.

Object. 6. The Church at the first, for example, when it was but a hundredth
and twenty, had the full entire power within it self: Ergo, it should be in a
worse case by the multiplication of Churches, if now that power be given to
Presbyteries.
Ans. It is a conjecture, that the whole Christian Church Acts 1. was only an
hundredth and twenty. I think there were more, though these only convened at
the ordination of Matthias, for there were above five hundred Brethren at once
which saw CHRIST after his Resurrection, 1 Cor. 15. 6. and these, I Judge,
belonged to the Christian Church also. 2. It is constantly denied that addition
of lawful power to lawful power does arnull, or put in a worse condition the
prexistent power; it does help it, but not make it worse: and twenty Churches
adding their good and Christian counsels, and comforts to two Churches do not
annull, or hurt or swallow up either the power of good counseling in these two
Churches or their good counsels, but do much confirm, and strengthen them.

Object. 7. It is absurd that there should be a Church in a Church, and two
distinct kind of Churches, or a power above a power, a Jurisdiction above a
Jurisdiction, a State above a State, as Master and Servant, and Father and
Son, so there is here a governing and a commanding Classical Presbytery, and
a governed and commanded Classical Church, and in a political consideration
formally different: now where there be two different States, there be two
different names, Titles, and Adjuncts, as 1 Cor. 12. 28. GOD has set some in
the Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets. So it is said, Genesis 1. GOD
made two distinct Lights, a greater Light to serve the Day, and a lesser Light
to rule the Night. But the Scripture makes no mention of greater or lesser
Presbyteries, we have the name of Presbytery but twice in the New Testament,
and in matter they differ not, for these same Elders are the matter of both: in
form they differ not, for the same combination and union is in all: they differ
not in operations, for the superior has no operations but such as the inferior
can exercise, for because a Pastor exhort^th a Pastor comsorteth, we do not
make two kinds of Pastors, if we cannot find a distinction betwixt presbyter
and Presbyter, how can w^e (...) a distinction betwixt Presbytery and
Presbytery? Has the Wisdom of Christ left these Thrones in such a confusion,
as by Scripture they cannot be known, by Name, Title, Nature, Operations? And
if there be a power above a power, we have to a^end to a Nation and so to
subdite a whole Nation, and their consciences to this Government, and we are to
put a Kingdom within a Kingdom.

Answ. A Church-Congregationall within a Church-Classicall is no more
inconventent, then a part in the whole, an Hand in the Body, and that is a
lesser body in a greater, and our Brethren call the people a Church, and the
Elders the Elders of the Church, and what is this but a Church in a Church? 2.
A power above a power, is not absurd, ex^ept it be a Church Power, so above a
Church Power, as the Superior power be privative and destructive to the
inferior, as the Popes power distroyeth the power of the Church Universal, and
the prelates power destroys the power of the (...) where of he is pretended
Pastor. But the power of the presbytery is A^xiliarte, and cumulative to help
the Congregation, not privative and destructive to destroy the power of
congregations.

Secondly, a power above a power in the Church cannot be denied by our
Brethren: for 1. In the Eldership of a ^^^gle Congregation, the Eldership in
the Court has a power of Jurisdiction above a power of order, which one single
Minister has, to preach the Word and administrate the Sacraments; for they may
regulate the Pastor and censure him, if he preach heretical Doctrine: is not
this a power above a power? yea two Elders in the Court have a power of
Jurisdiction to govern with the whole prebsytery, but the power of the whole
presbytery is above the power of a part. But to com^ nearer; The Apostles and
Elders at Jerusalem met in a Synod have a power, in dogmaticall points over the
Church at Antioch, and others: and our Brethren say that the Church at Antioch
might have in their inferior Synod determined these same points which the
Synod determined at Jerusalem; here is power above power.

Thirdly, we do not see how they be two, or diverse indicatures formally and
specisically different in nature and operations, for they differ only in more
or less extension of power, as the reasons do prove, as the power of
government in one City or Borough, does not differ formally from the power of
the whole Cities and Boroughs, incorporated and combined in one common
Judicature, and the power of two or three, or four Colleges, does not differ
from the power of the whole combination of Colleges combined in the comm on
Judicature of the Universities: so here the powers of the inferior Judicatures
do differ from the Superior only in degree, and in number of members of the
Judicatures; the policy divine is one and the same, though the Superior can
exercise acts of Jurisdiction different from the Acts of the inferior in an
ordinary way; such as are ordination of Pastors and excommunication, where many
Churches are consociated; though, where this consociation is not, Ordination
and Excommunication may be done by one single Congregation: also to argue from
the not distinction of Names, Titles and Adjuncts of the Iudicatures is but a
weak Argument, because Congregationall, and presbyterian, provincial and a
national Church-Body make all one body, and the inferior is but a part and
member of the Superior, and thefore it was not needful that as Apostles and
Prophets, and the Sun the greater light by name and Office is distinguished
from the Moon Genesis 1. the lesser light, that Congregation and Presbyter should
be distinguished by Names and Office and Titles in the Scripture; for a Prophet
is not formally a part of an Apostle, but an Officer formally different from
him, and the Moon is not a part of the Sun, as a Congregation is a part of the
Classical Church: so Mat. 18. the Scripture distinguishes not the people and
Elders in the word (Ecclesia) Church, as our Brethren will have then both meant
in that place, Mat. 18. Teil the Church. Now we say as they do to us in the
like, we are not to distinguish where the Law does not distinguish. But the
Scripture says, Mat. 18. The Church that the offended has recourse unto, is
that Church which must be obeyed as a Judicature and spiritual Court, but the
people is neither a Judicature, nor any part thereof. And 2. Of that Church
Christ does speak that does actually bind on Earth and loose on Earth, and
that by the power of the Keys, but the people neither as a part of the Court
does actually bind and loose on Earth by power of the Keys. 3. Christ speaks
of that Court, and of that Church which does exercise Church Power on Earth,
under the title of binding and loosing; but we find not a Church in the face
and presence of the people binding and loosing under the name of the Church, in
the Word of God. Shall we use such an insolent signification of the word
Church, as the Word of God does not use? and Lastly, I say of these of Corinth
gathered together convened together in the Name of the Lord Jesus, with the
Ministerial spirit of Paul and with the power of the Lord Jesus; these cannot
be the Church excommunicating before the people. The Text destinguisheth not
the Court of Elders who has the power of Jurisdiction from the people, and all
these to whom he writes, and who were puffed up and mourned not for the
scandal, have no such power of Jurisdiction: nor can the Text bear that the
Elders set up a Court before the Eyes of all the people, and delivered such a
man to Satan, so as this is called the head of Elders and people, as our
Brethren teach, and here they distinguish where the Scripture distinguishes
not.

Fourthly, if the Scripture give to us Thrones really different, though names
and titles cannot be found, more then we find expressly and in words; two
Sacraments, three Persons and one God, Christ Jesus in two Natures, and one
Person, then have we what we seek: but we have these different in the things
themselves, as Acts 2. 46. we have a Church meeting in an House, for Word and
Sacraments, as Acts 20. 8. and a Congregation in Corinth meeting in an House, 1
Cor. 11. 20. 1 Cor. 14. 23. and consequently here must be some power in this
meeting to order the worship of God: this single meeting is to rebuke those
that sin openly, and to hinder Women to preach in the Congregation; and to
forbid, by the power of the Keys, that two speak at once; because God is the
God of order; to borbid Doctrine that edifieth not, and speaking Gods Word in
an unknowen Tongue, etc. 2. There is an Eldership (...) in every City in
Ephesus, in Jerusalem who met for Jurisdiction, Acts 21. 18. who laid hands on
Timothy, 1 Timothy 14. 14. in Antioch, Acts 13. 1. 3. There is a meeting of a
provincial Church in Galathia; where there are many Churches, as may be
gathered from Acts 5. 9. 10. who were to purge out the scandalous and false
Teachers who leavened all others, and who were Gal. 6. 1. to restore with the
spirit of meekness any fallen Brother; and 4. There a map and pattern of a
general Synod warranting both a national Church-meeting, and an O^cumenick
council. And the like may be gathered from that Synod, Acts 1. and Acts 6.
where these universal guides of the whole Christian World, to wit, the
Apostles were, and did exercise Jurisdiction, by ordaining of Officers; and
though instances of these could not be given in Scripture, there is a moral
ground and warrant for it 1. Because joint power of Jurisdiction are surer and
better, then a lesser and dispersed power. For if the Keys be given to the
Church visible, not to this or this little Church, as meetting in a private
House, Acts 2. 46. Acts 20. 8. The division or union of this power, the
extension of it must be squared by the rule of most convenient edification, and
it cannot stand with edification if it be given to one Congregation only: The
God of nature for conserving humane societies, has given the power of
government originally, not to one, but to a multitude; for one only is not in
danger to be wronged and oppressed in a society; but a society is in this
danger, therefore has God given this power to a multitude: and a multitude is
the formal object of policy and government, and cannot but be d^ssolved, where
Laws and Government are not; So the God of Grace must have given a power of
government to a society and multitude of little Churches: for a multitude of
Congregations is a multitude, and therefore this society and consociation
cannot subsist, except Christ have provided a supernatural government for it.
It is not reasonable, that some say, a moral institution is not an
institution; for Magistracy is both moral, and a Divine institution; that God
have a certain day for his service is both moral, and also a Divine
institution: all institutions are not merely positive, as some suppose, such as
is, that the last day of the week be the Sabbath, that Bread and Wine be signs
of Christ's Body br^ken, and his Blood shed for us. So supposing that Christ
have a visible Church, it is moral that she have power of government also, in
so far as she is a Church. Yea power of government, upon this supposition,
is natural, or rather con natural; so by the same ground upon supposall that
Christ have, in a Nation, a multitude of consociated Churches, who for vicinity
may either edify, encourage, comfort and provoke ^re another to love and good
works, they submitting themselves to the Laws of Christ's policy, or may
scandalize one another (as many consociated Churches in Galathia were bent to
bite, dev^ure and consume one another, Gal. 5. 15.) it is moral, yea and
con-naturall that they be under a Divine policy external. Nor is it more
agreeable to the Wisdom of Christ that a multitude of consociated Churches in
one Land should be left to the Laws of nature, and Christian brotherhood, and
be loosed from all Laws of external policy, then that the just Lord who
intends the conservation of humane societies should leave every man to the
Law of nature, and not give them a power to set up a Magistracy, and to appoint
humane and civil Laws whereby they may be conserved. And I think we should
all say, if God had appointed every great Family* yea or every twenty Families
in the World to be independent, within it self and subordinate to no civil
law, to no power, to no Magistracy without that independent little
incorporation, that God had not then appointed a power of civil Policy, and
civil Laws for the conservation of mankind; and the reason should be clear,
because in one Shire, Country, Province and Nation there should be a
multitude, to wit, ten hundred, ten thousand independent Kingdoms subject to
no Laws, nor civil policy, but immediately subordinate to GOD in the Law of
nature, and when these ten thousand should rise up and with the Sword devour
one another, and one society independent should wrong another, the only remedy
should be to complain to God, and renounce civil communion with such
Societies; that is, traffic not with them, (do not take or give, borrow or
lend, buy or sell with them) but it is unlawful to use any coercive power of
natural, or civil reparation to compel them to do duty, or execute mercy
and Judgment one toward another: now seeing grace destroys not nature,
neither can there be a policy independent which does contradict this maxim of
natural policy, acknowledged by all, in all policies, civil, natural,
supernatural, God intending the conservation of societies both in Church and
State has subjected all Societies, and Multitudes to Laws of external
policy: but so it is, a Multitude of little Congregations is a Multitude; and a
Society. Then it must follow, that government of independent little bodies,
under no coactive power of Church censures, must want all divine institution
and so be will worship.

For these it shall be easy to answer the obloquies of some, saying, that a
national Church under the New Testament is Judaisme. Hence say they, a
national Religion, a national Oath or Covenant, is like a World-Church, a
Church, a huge body as big as the Earth: and so, if some Augustus should subdue
the whole World to himself with the Sword, He might compel the World to
be all of one Church, of one Religion.

Answ. The term Nationall-Church is not in the Word of God, but I pray you in
what sense can the Iewish-Church be called a Nationall-Church? I conceive not,
because of the typical and ceremonial observances that put a Church-frame on
the whole Nation: for if so, then the name of a National Church or a national
Religion cannot, by envy it self, be put in the reformed Churches, or on
Church of Scotland which has suffered so much for Jewish and Romish
Ceremonies. But if the Jews were a Nationall-Church, because they were a holy
Nation in profession, and God called the Nation, and made (...), a Church
externally called to grace and glory and the whole Nation commensurable, and of
equal extent then all Christian Nations professing the true Faith, and the
Gentiles, as well as the Jews; Then the believing Jews of Pontus, Asia,
Cappadocia, and Bythinia (as Augustine, Eusebius, Oecumenius, Athanasius do
think that Peter wrote to the Jews) yea and the Gentiles, (as many
interpreters with Lorinus, Thomas, Lyra and others think) are yet 1 Pet. 2. 9.
an holy Nation, and so a National Church; and there is no more reason to
scoff at a National Church in this sense, then to mock the holy Spirit which
makes but one Church in all the World, Cant. 6. 9. as Cotton, Ainsworth, and
other favorable witnesses to our Brethren, confess; And if the Gentiles shall
come to the light of the Jewish Church, and Kings to the brightness of of
their rising, Esai. 60. 3. if the abundance of the Sea shall be converted to
the Jews true Faith and Religion; And the forces of the Gentiles shall come to
them, verse. 5. and if all flesh shall see the revealed glory of the Lord, Esai.
40. 5. and the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the Seas
are filled with Water. It is most agreeable to the Lords Word that there, is
and shall be a Church through the whole World; you may nickname it as you
please, and call it a VVorld-Religion, a VVorld-Church. As if the lost and
blinded World, Ioh. 2. 16, 17. 1 John 5. 19. 2 Corin, 4. 4. were all one with
the Loved, Redeemed, Pardoned and Reconciled World, Ioh. 3. 16. Ioh. 1. 29. 2
Cor. 5. 19. as if we confounded these two Worlds, and the Religion of these
two Worlds. And if this World could meet in its principal lights, neither
should an universal council, nor an Oath of the whole Representative Church
be unlawful, but enough of this before. And what if the World be subdued to
the World, and a World of Nations come in, and submit to Christ's Scepter, and
royal power in his external government: are the opposers such strangers in
the Scriptures, as to doubt of this? Read then Esai. 60. 4. 5. c. 60. 11, 12,
13, 14, 15: v. 4. 5, 6 7. Psalm. 2. 8, 9. Psalm. 72. 8. 9. 10. Esai. 54. 3. Esai.
49. 1. Esai. 45. 22. 23. Psalm. 110: 1, 2, 3, 4 5. and many other places, and
there is a Kingdom in a Kingdom. Christ's Kingdom and his Church lodging in a
Worldly Kingdom, and Christ spiritually in his power triumphing over the
World, and subduing Nations to his Gospel.

Object. 8. If Classical Presbyters be not Elders in ^elation to the
classical Church, and so to all the Congregations in it, ye must forsake all
these places, where it is said, the Elders of Jerusalem, the Elders of Ephesus,
the Angels of the seven Churches, which is absurd; if they be Elders to all
these Churches, then 1. All those people in those Churches must submit their
consciences to them and their Ministry, as to a lawful ordinance of God. 2.
All the people of those Churches must have voice in election of them all. 3.
All these people owe to the^s maintenance and double honor. 1 Timothy 5. 17. for
if the Oxes mouth must not be muzl^d, but he must be fed by me and my corn, he
must tread my corn, and labor for me. These Churches cannot all meet in one,
to ordain, and choose all these Ministers, and to submit to their Ministry.
Answ. The Elders are Elders of Ephesus and Elders of Jerusalem, not because
every Elder has a special, pastoral charge over every Church distributively
taken, for it was unpossible that one Congregation of all the converts in
Jerusalem extending to so many thousands, could all bear the relation of a
Church to one man as their proper Elder, who should personally reside in all,
and every one of those Congregations to watch for their souls, to preach to
all and every Congregation (...), in season and out of season. But they are in
cumulo called Elders of Ephesus, in that sense that Kings are called the Kings
of the Nations not because every King was King of every Nation, for the King of
Edom was not the King of Babylon; and the King of Babel was not the King of
Assyria, yet amongst them they did all fill up that name to be called the Kings
of the Nations, so were the Elders of Jerusalem in cumulo, collectively taken,
Elders of all the Churches of Jerusalem collectively taken; and as it follows
not that the King of Edom, because he is one of the Kings of the Nations, is
elected to the Crown of Caldea, by the Voices of the States and Nobles of
Caldea; so is it not a good consequence, such a number are called the Elders of
the Church of Jerusalem, therefore the Elder of one Congregation at the
Eastern Gate at Jerusalem, is also an Elder of a Congregation of the Western
Gate. Nor does it follow that these two Congregations should submit their
consciences to one and the same Elder as to their proper Pastor; to whose
Ministry they owe consent in Election, Obedience in submitting to his
Doctrine, and mainetenance for his labors; all these are due to him, who is
their own proper Pastor: the as Caldeans owe not Honor, Allegiance, Tribute
to the King of Edom, though the Kingdom of Caldea be one of the Kingdoms of
the Nations, and the King of Edom one of the Kings of the Nations. But if
indeed all the Kings of the Nations did meet in one Court, and in that Court
govern the Nations with common Royal authority, and counsel in those things
which concern all the Kingdoms in common; then all the Nations were obliged
to obey them in that Court, as they govern in that Court, but no farther: and
when the people do consent to the power of that common Court ^^citly, they
consent that every one of these shall be chosen King of such and such a
Kingdom; and promise also tracitly Obedience, and Subjection to every one of
the Kings of the Nations, not simply as they are Kings in relation to such a
Kingdom, but only as they are members of that Court; so the Congregations
acknowledging and consenting to the classical Presbytery, do tracitly choose
and consent to the common charge and care that every Pastor has, as he is a
Member of that common Court which does concern them all, therefore all these
consequences are null.

Object. 9. But when the Presbytery does excommunicate in a particular
Congregation by a delegate, they may with as good reason, preach by a delegate,
as exercise Jurisdiction by a delegate; the one is as personal and
incommunicable, as the ^^^r.
Answ. It is certain there be great odds; for the acts of jurisdiction
performed by speaking in the Name of Jesus Christ, do come from a College and
Court, and because it were great confusion that a whole Court should speak,
therefore of necessity such acts must be done by a delegate. Indeed the
Juridicall acts of the whole juridicall proceeding of decerning the man to be
excommunicated cannot be done by one man only, it would be most conveniently
done by the whole Senate, or at least by a select number against which the
accused party has no exception, and is willing to be judged by; but the acts
of order, as Preaching flowing from the power of order, can be performed only
by the Pastor in his own person, and not by a deputy. Except that a Synodicall
teaching, which comes from the power of Jurisdiction may be sent in writ by
Messengers and Deputies to the Churches, Acts 15. 25. Acts 16. 4.

Object. 10. A Pastor is not a Pastor, but in relation to his own Church, or
Congregation. Therefore he cannot do Pastoral Acts of either Order, or
Jurisdiction in a Presbytery.
Answ. How a Pastor is a Pastor in relation to all the World deserves
discussing.

First, Some have neither power of Order nor Jurisdiction in any place, as
private persons.

Secondly, some have both power of Order and Jurisdiction through all the
World, as the Apostles who might teach and administrate the Sacraments, and
Excommunicate as Apostles, in every Church.

Thirdly, some have power of Order, and Jurisdiction in a certain determinate
place, as Pastors in their own particular Congregations.

Fourthly, some have power of Order in relation to all the World, as Pastors
of a Congregation, who are Pastors validly Preaching and Administrating the
Sacraments, but orderly and lawfully Preaching, where they have a calling of
those, who can call to the occasional exercise of their calling hic and nunc.
In this meaning a Pastor of one flock is a Pastor, in regard of power of Order
to all the World. Because though his pastoral teaching be restrained by the
Church in ordinary, only to this Congregation, yet has he a pastoral power
to preach to all the World, in in an occasional way, both by Word and Writ,
yet does not this power being but the half of his Ministerial power,
denominate him a Pastor to all the World, as the Apostles were; and the same
way has he power to administrate the Sacraments, and this way may our
Brethren see that power of order to be a Minister or Pastor is given by the
Presbytery, so as if the man were deprived clave non errante, he now has lost
his pastoral relation to both the Catholic Church, and that Congregation,
whereof he is a Pastor. So as he is now a private man, in relation not only
to that Congregation whereof he was a Pastor, but also in relation to the
whole visible Church; now no particular Congregation has power to denude him
of this relation, that he had to the whole catholic Church. But a Pastor of a
flock is a Pastor in respect of power of Jurisdiction, not over all the World,
to excommunicate in every Presbytery, with the Presbytery, he is only capable
by virtue of his power of order, to exercise power of Jurisdiction, where he
shall come, upon suposall of a call, if he be chosen a Pastor there, or be
called to be a Commissioner in the higher, or highest Courts of the Church
catholic, but other ways he has no power of Jurisdiction, but in that Court
whereof he is a member; that is, in the Eldership of a Congregation, and in the
Classical Presbytery: for he is so a member of a Congregation, as he is also
a member of the Classical Presbytery, and therefore though he be not a Pastor
one way in this Classical Court, I mean in respect of power of order, yet is
he a Pastor, (...), in watching over that Church, in respect of power of
Jurisdiction.

Our Brethrens ground then is weak when they say. A Pastor cannot give the
Seals to those of another Congregation, because he has no Ministerial power
over those of another Congregation; if they mean power of Jurisdiction, it is
true, he has no Jurisdiction over those of another Congregation: but if they
mean, he has no power of order over them, that is, for what ever be the
Churches part in this, it is certain the Pastor does administrate the Seals
by power of order, and not by power of Jurisdiction, and the Church as the
Church has not any power of order, for she is not called to any pastoral
dignity, though we should grant that, which yet can never be proved, that
she is invested with a Ministerial power.

Object, 11. If the Church, which you suppse to be presbyteriall, to wit, the
Church of Corinth, did excommunicate, or was commanded to excommunicate the
incestu^us person, before the Congregation convened and met in one, then must
your classical Church exercise all other acts of Jurisdiction, before all the
Congregationall Churches of the Classical Presbytery meet in one.
But this latter is as unpossible, as absurd; For how shall thirty or forty
Congregations meet all, in one place, for all the several acts of
Jurisdiction? Also you confess that many Congregations cannot meet in one
place: that the proposition may be made good; We suppose these grounds of the
Presbyteriall frame of Churches: 1. That the presbyteriall Church of Corinth,
not the Congregation had the only power of excommunication. 2. That this man
was to be excommunicated in presence, and so with the consent of the whole
multitude, for so the Text says, 1 Cor. 5. 4. (...). When you are gathered
together. 3. Excommunication is the highest act of Jurisdiction in the Church,
being the binding of the sinner in Heaven and Earth, if therefore this highest
act of Jurisdiction must be performed before all the Church congregated in
one, then must all acts of Jurisdiction be performed also in presence of the
congregated Church; for it concerns their edification, and is a matter of
conscience to then: all. 4. The reason why we think sit he should be
excommunicated before, or in presence of that Congregation whereof he is a
member, is because it concerns them, and he is a member of this
Congregation, But by your grounds, the whole Presbyteriall or classical Church
should be present, which were unpossible; for he is to you a Member of the
whole Classical Church, and the power of excommunication is in the whole
classical Church, and they ought to be present by the same reason, that the
Congregation, whereof he is a nearest member, is present.

Answ. 1. There be many things in this argument to be corrected, as 1. That the
Church of Corinth conve^ed in the whole multitude whom it concerned, for (...),
does not prove it; for the same Word is spoken of the meeting of the Apostles
and Elders, who met in a Synod with authority, Acts 15. 6. the word (...) is
attributed to the multitude, Acts 21. v. 22. and to the Church of Believers, 1
Cor. 11. 20. and 1 Cor. 14. 23. therefore the one word (...) seems to be no
cogent Argument. 2. The word (...), which is not here in all this Chapter, or
(...) is used in the New Testament, and by the seventy Interpreters, whose
translation Christ and his Apostles do frequently follow in the New Testament,
use the words for any meeting of good or ill, of civil or Ecclesiastical
persons. As I might instance is a great many places of the Old and New
Testament; then what is it, I pray you, which restricteth the signification of
these words to signify a civil, rather then an Ecclesiastical meeting?
certainly the actions which the company does when they are met, and the end for
which they meet. I give an instance in Acts 19. 41. the word (...) (the like I
say of (...)) signifies not the Church of Christ, and why? it is a reason that
cannot be controlled. They were assembled for to raise a tumult against Paul
which was no Church-action, and so no Church end is here. So v. 39. But if you
enquire any thing in other matters, it shall be determined (...) in a lawful
assembly; surely the end of such an assembly in Ephesus, where this man was
Town-Clark in the meeting, could be. no Church-businesse, Hence we are led to
know what (...), an Assembly or Church signifies here not the Church of
Christ, so Psalm. 22. 16. the Assembly of the wicked has enclosed me (...)
Merighem the seventy Interpreters turn it (...), and T^rtullian follows
them, the persons congregated, the actions and end for which they convenc lead
us to this, that the Word signifies not a Church of Christ. So we may see,
Psalm. 26. 5. the Congregation of Elders cannot be a true Church, 2. 1 Cor. 11.
18. for first when you come together to the Church, (...), I hear there are
divisions amongst you. The place must signify the Church of Believers, because
the end of their meeting was the Supper of the Lord, or their communion, v. 20.
as the Text clears, and 1 Cor. 14. 23. when the whole Church comes
together, that was for prophesying and hearing of the Word, as the Text is
evident, v. 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25 26, 27. and therefore here the word (...)
must signify the Church of Pastors preaching, and people hearing the Word,
praying and praising God. So in the third place when (...), the Church is
convened to bind and loose, and to excommunicate, as Mat. 18. 17. 18. 19. there
is no necessity that the Word Church, should include those who have no power of
the keys, and cannot by power of the Keys bind and loose. And therefore from
the naked and mere Grammar of the word (...), no argument can be drawn to
prove that (...) Matthew. 18. 17. must signify that same which it does signify,
1 Corin. 1. 1. 1 Corin. 11. 18. 1 Corin. 14. 23. for the word actu primo, and
originally, signifies any meeting, but the persons who are Congregated and the
end for which they meet leads us to the meaning and Grammatical sense of
the word, in that place. Now Matthew. 18. the Ecclesia, a Church Congregated
there is such as binds and loses in Heaven and Earth, and congregated for
that use: therefore I see not how the circumstances of the place helping us to
the Grammatical sense of the word here, as in all other places, does not
enforce us to say in this place Mat. 18. the word Ecclesia, Church, must
signify only those who have power to bind and loose, that is, only the
Elders, and not the people. So to come to the place, 1 Cor. 5.

Those who come under the name of (...), congregated together, must be
expounded by the persons Office, and the end of their meeting, now the persons
Office is Ministerial, he will have them congregated by Paul's Ministerial
spirit, and in the name and with the power of the Lord Jesus, this is the power
of the Keys, which he who has David's Keys Esai. 22. 22. on his Shoulders,
Revel. 3. 7. gives to his own Officers, Matthew. 16. 19. and these persons
cannot be all that he writes unto v. 1. all that were p^ffed up, and mourned
not at the offense given by the incestuous (...), to Jesus Christ's holy Nam^
and Church, all who are to forbear eating and drinking with excommunicated
persons, verse. 11. all who were in danger to be leavened, verse 6. all who were
to keep the Feast in sincerity, not with the old Leaven of wickedness and
malice: for these directly were the whole multitude of Believers, Men, Women,
and Children, who (I am sure) were not capable of the Keys and the
Ministerial power of Paul. 2. The end wherefore these (...) who were convened,
did meet and convene, was, verse. 5. (...). to deliver the man to Satan, they
were not convened to celebrate the Lords Supper, as the Church is convened, 1
Cor. 11. 18. nor for hearing the Word of Prophecy, or Preaching, as 1 Cor. 14.
23, 24. And whether you construe the Words (...) with the Power of the Lord
Jesus, with the Verb (...), to deliver to Satan, or with the Participle (...)
congregated in the Name and Power of CHRIST, all is one; the multitude of
common Believers, of Men, Women, and Children, are neither capable of the
power, nor of the exercise of that power to deliver to Satan. And therefore
this meeting together, by no Grammar does lead us to say that the sentence was
to be pronounced in face and presence of the multitude convened, verse. 21.
Giving, but not granting that the Church of Corinth, in all its members, must
be convened. Though I hold it not necessary by this place, yet it follows
not that all other acts of Jurisdiction must be exercised in face of the whole
Congregation: for there is a special reason of the pronouncing of the
sentence, which is not in other acts: the pronouncing of the sentence,
concerns more the nearest Congregation of which the Delinquent is a member,
in relation of nearest and daily Communion, it concerns also other
Congregations of the Classical Church, of which also the Delinquent is a
member, but not so immediately and nearly, because (as I said before) the more
universal the Church visible is, the external visible Communion is l^sse;
even as when the number of a Family is cut off, by the Sword of the Magistrate,
the matter first and more intimately and more nearly concerns the Family
whereof he is a Member, yet it does also concern the Commonwealth, of which
also he is a Member. A Finger of the right Hand is infected with a contagious
Gangren, it is to be cut off; yet the cutting-off concerns more nearly the
right Hand, then it does the left Hand, and the whole Body. For the contagion
should first overspread the right Hand and Arm, and Shoulder, before it
infect the left Hand, and the whole Body; though it do not a little concern
the whole Body also. So though actual Excommunication concern all the
Churches of the Presbytery: yet it does more nearly concern the Congregation
whereof he is a Member. 2. The pronouncing of the sentence being edificative,
it is a fit mean to work upon others, but calling and trying of witnesses,
and Juridicall decerning of a Man to be Excommunicated, requiring secrecies,
yea and some scandals, and circumstances of Adultery, Incest, Pestiality,
requiring a modest covering of them, from Virgins, young Men, Children and the
multitude, we have no warrant of GOD, that they should be tried before the
whole multitude, nor are acts of Jurisdiction for their excellency, to be
brought forth before the people but for their neerenesse of concernment, and
use of edification.

Object. 12. The people are to consent, yea they must have a power, and some
thing more than a consent in Excommunication; Ergo, they are all to be
present. The antecedent is proved, 1. Because they were not puffed up, they did
not keep the Feast, they did not dostaine from eating with the incestuous
person, only by consent. 2. Others not of that Church did excommunicate by
consent. 3. It is said, v. 12, do ye not judge them that are within?
Answ. If you will have them to excommunicate the same way, that they do other
duties, you may say they excommunicate the same way that Pastors and Elders
do, and if they Judge, verse. 12. as the Elders do, either all the people are
Judges, and where are then all the governed, if all be governors? or then he
speaks in this Chapter to the Churches-Iudges only. 2. There be degrees of
consent, these of other Churches have a tacit and remote consent, the people
of the Congregation are to hear, and know the cause, and deal in private with
the offender, and to mourn, and pray for him.

Object. 13. The highest and double honor is due to him who labors in the
word, 1 Timothy 5. 17. but if the Presbyteriall Church be the highest Church, it
shall not have the double honor, for it is only the governing Church.
Answ. Highest honor is due in suo genere, to both. And this is, as if you
should compare obedience and honor, that I owe to my Father with that which I
owe to my Grandfather, 2. Paul, 1 Timothy 5. 17. compares Elders of diverse
sorts together; as the Ruling and Teaching Elder, here you compare Pastors to
be honored in respect of one act, with themselves to be honored in respect
of another act; and this might prove, I am to give more honor to my Pastor for
preaching in the Pulpit, then for ruling in the Church-Senate.

Object. 14. The Congregation is the highest Church, for it has all the
Ordinances, Word, Sacraments, Jurisdiction; Ergo, there is not any
Presbyteriall Church higher which has only disciplinary power.
Answ. There is a double highness, one of Christian Dignity. 2. Another, of
Church-prehemenency, or of Ecclesiastical authority: indeed the Congregation,
the former way, is highest, the company of Believers is the Spouse and ransomed
Bride of Christ. But the Eldership has the Ecclesiastical eminency; as the
Kings heir and Son is above his Master and Teacher one way, yet the Teacher
(as the Teacher by the fifth Commandment) is above the Kings Son as the
Teacher is above him who is taught; And so is the Case here.

Object. 15. The Arguments for a Classical, or Presbyteriall Church do much
side with Prelacy; for you make many Lords ruling and not teaching.
Answ. Let all judge whether the independent power of three Elders accountable
to none, in a Church Way, but to Jesus Christ only, as you make your little
Kingdoms on Earth, be nearer to the Popes Monarchy, and especially when there
is but one Pastor in the Congregation, then the subordinate Government of
fourscore, or an hundred Elders^ sure I am, three Neighbors are nearer to one
Monarch, then three hundred. 2. One Monarchical Society is as tyrannical
Antichristianism as one Monarchical Pastor. 3. If we made many ruling and
dominering Lords, you should say something; but we make many servants endued
only with Ministerial power, only to teach and rule, and to be accomptable
to the Church; your Eldership in this agrees with the Pope, that though they
deliver many Souls to Satan, yet no Man on Earth can, in a Church Way, say,
What do you?

ACT. XV.
A Pattern of a juridicall Synod.
THat the Apostles in that famous Synod, Act. 15. did not go on by the
assistance of an immediately inspired spirit and by Apostolic authority, but
only, as Elders, and the Doctors and Teachers assisted with an ordinary
spirit, to me is evident from the course of the context.

1. Because Act. 15. when a controversy arise in the Church ^^ Antiochia,
Epiphanius haer. 26. al^^s 28
Epiphanius says, as also Hieronymus Epist. 89.
Hieronymus, by C^^mbus, and others, touching the keeping of Moses his Law,
especially the Ceremonies, except they would be losers in the bu^nesse of
their salvation, Paul could not go as sent by Ami^h to submit that Doctrine,
which he received not from flesh and blood, but by the revelation of Jesus
Christ, Gal. 1. 12. to the determination of a Synod of Apostles and Elders for
who would think that the immediately inspiring spirit i^ P^ul, would submit
himself, and his Doctrine to the immediately inspiring spirit in Paul, Peter,
Apostles, and Elders, therefore Paul and Birnabas, come as sent to Jerusalem,
not ^^ Apostles, or as immediately inspired, but as ordinary teach^^. Therefore
says Diodatus, au in Act. 15.
Diodatus, Not because these two A^ (...) were every wayequall to the rest in
the light and conduct (...) Spirit, and in Apostolical authority, Gal. 2. 6.
8. had any (...) instruction, or of confirmation, but only to give the weak
(...), who had more confidence in Peter and James, and in the Church at
Jerusalem, and to stop false doctors mouths, and to esta^^^^, by common votes,
a general order in the Church. Hence when a controversy arises in the
Apostolic Church, and the Controversy is betwixt an Apostle as Paul was, and
others, and both sides allege Scripture, as here both did, out of all
controversy, there is no reason, that the Apostle Paul, who was now a party
should judge it: and when a single Congregation in the like case is on two
sides, about the like question, nature, reason and Law cry that neither can be
judge, and therefore a Synod is the divine and Apostolic remedy which must
condemn the wrong side, as subverters of souls, as here they do, v. 24. And
the Apostle when he will speak and determine as an Apostle, he takes it on
him in another manner, as Gal. 5. 2. Behold I Paul say unto you, that if you
be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing; he speaks now as an
immediately inspired penman and organ infallible of the holy Ghost: but it were
absurd to send the immediately inspired organ of the holy Ghost as such, to
ask counsel and seek resolution from the immediately inspired organs of the
holy Ghost. 2. The rise of controversies in a Church is not Apostolic, nor
temporary or extraordinary, but to ordinary we have the Scriptures indeed to
consult with, so had the Churches, whose souls were notwithstanding subverted,
v. 24. and this assembly does determine the controversy by Scripture, v. 14.
Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, etc. v. 15.
And to this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written, etc. But because
Scriptures may be alleged by both sides, as it was here, and we have not the
Apostles now alive to consult withal, can Jesus Christ have left any other
external and Church-remedy, when many Churches are perverted, as here was the
cases of the Churches of the Gentiles, v. 23. in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia,
then that Teachers and Elders be sent to a Synod to determine the question
according to the Word of God?

2. Here also is a Synod and a determination of the Church of Antioch, v. 2.
(...), They determined to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem: I prove that it
was a Church determination, for Chap. 14. 26. Paul and Barnabas come to
Antioch; v. 24. And when they were come, (...), having gathered together the
Church of Antioch, they rehearsed all that God had done by them, and how he
had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles, (28. And there they abode a
long time with the disciples) Chap. 15. 1. And certain m^n which came down
from Judea, taught the brethren, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of
Moses, ye c^^^^ be saved; hence v. 2. when there was much debate about the
question, and it could not be determined there, (...), they made a
Church-ordinance to send Paul and Barnabas as Church-messengers, o^
Church-Commissioners to the Synod, and (...) relates to (...) the gathered
together Church, Chap. 14. v. 27. and it is ^eare, ^. 3. (...), being sent on
their way by the Church, to (...) of Antiach: Ergo, this was an authoritative
Church sending, and not an Apostolic journey performed by Paul as an Apostle,
but as a messenger of the Church at Antioch, and as a messenger Paul returns
with Barnabas and gives a due rec^oning and account of his commission to the
Church of Antioch, who sent him, v. 30. So when they, ( Paul and Barnabas
having received the determination of the Synod) when they were dismissed, they
came to Antioch, (...), which words are relative to Chap. 14. 27. having
gathered together the Church, and to Chap. 15. 3. being sent on their way by
the Church, so here having gathered the whole Church, the multitude, they
delivered the Epistle of the Synod, and read it in the hearing of all the
multitude, for it concerned the practice of all whereas it was (...) the Church
which sent them, Cb. 14. 27. Chapter 15. 2. 3. So here we have a subordination of
Churches and Church-Synod, for the Synod or Presbytery of Antioch, called the
Church con^eened, Chapter 14. 27. and the Church ordaining and enacting that Paul
and Barnabas shall be sent as Commissioners to Jerusalem, is subordinate to the
greater Synod of Apostles and Elders at Jerusalem, which says to me that
controversies in an interior Church-meeting are to be referred to an higher
meeting con^^ting of more.

3. The (...), this dissension and disputation between Paul and B^rnabas, and
some of the believing Jews who taught the brethren they behoved to be
circumcised, was a Church-entroversie; Paul and Barnabas did hold the negative,
and defended the Church of the brethren from embracing such wicked opinions;
and when Antioch could not determine the question, Paul and Barnabas had
recourse to a Synod, as ordinary Shepherds, who when they could not persuade
the ^rethren of the falsehood of the doctrine, went to seek help against
subverters of souls, (as they are called, v. 24.) at the established
judicatures and ecclesiasticail meetings; for when Paul's preaching cannot
prevail, though it was canonical, he descends to that course which
ordinary Pastors by the light of nature should do, to seek help from a
College of Church-guides; Ergo, Paul did not this merely as an Apostle.

4. Verse. 6. The Apostles and Elders came together in an assembly, (...), to
consider of this matter This Synodicall consideration upon the Apostles part,
was either Apostolic, or it was Ecclesiastic. It was not Apostelick, because
the Apostles had Apostolically considered of it before, Paul had determined v.
2. against these subverters, that they should not be circumcised, nor was it a
thing that they had not fully considered before, for to determine this was not
so deep a mystery as the mystery of the Gospel; now he says of the Gospel,
(...). 1. 13. I received it not of men, neither was I taught it, but by the
revelation of Jesus Christ, v. 16. When it ples'ed God to reveal his son to
me that I should preach him among the ^eathen, I conferred not with flesh and
blood, neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were Apostles before me,
etc. then far less did he confer with Apostles and Elders, as touching
the ceremonies of Moses his Law. If any say, this was an Ecclesiastic meeting,
according to the matter, Apostolic, but according to the form, Ecclesiastic,
in respect the Apostles and Elders meet to consider how this might be
represented to the Churches as a necessary duty in this case of scandal; This
is all we crave, and the decree is formally ecclesiastic, and so the Apostles
gave out the decree in an ecclesiastical way, and this consideration
Synodicall is an ecclesiastical discussion of a controversy which concerned
the present practice of the Churches, and it not being Apostolic must obliege
many Churches convened in their principal guides, otherwise we agree that the
matter of every ecclesiastical decree, be a Scripturall truth, or then
warranted by the evident light of nature.

5. The manner of the Apostles proceeding in this council holds forth to us
that it was not Apostolic, because they proceed by way of communication of
counsels. 1. What light could Elders add to the Apostles as Apostles, but the
Elders as well as the Apostles, convened to consider about this matter, and
Act. 21. 18. 25. All the Elders of Jerusalem with James take on them these acts
as well as the Apostles, and they are the decrees of the Elders no less then
of the Apostles, Act. 16. ^. 4. a derivation of the immediate impi^ing Spirit
to ^^^ Elders, and by them as fellow members of the Synod to the Apostles, and
a derivation of this immediate Apostolic spirit, by the Apostles to the Elders
to make them also infallible, is unknown to Scripture; for one Prophet did not
immediately inspire another, and one Apostle did not immediately inspire another,
we read not in the Word of any such thing, and therefore it is said, Act. 15.
7. (...), And when there had been much disputing Peter s^^d up. All who
interpret this place say, even Papists not ex^pted, as Salmero com.in (...)
Salmeron, L^^mus ^. Lorinus, Cornelius a lapt. Cornelius a lapide, and others
on the place, that when there is not consultation and disputing on both sides
to find out the truth, but an absolute authority used by commanding, the
proceeding of the counceil is rash (says Salmeron;) now the Prophets were
immediately inspired, without any consultation with men in delivering Gods will,
and they saw the visions of God, as it is said. And the Word of the Lord came
to Jeremiah, to Ezechiel, to Hosea, etc. and be said, etc. yea when a
prophetical spirit came upon Ba^^m, Number. 24. be seeing the visions of God,
he prophesied directly contrary to his own carnal mind, and to his
consultation with Bal^^k: now it is clear that the Apostles, what they spoke,
by the breathings and inspirations of that immediately inspiring Spirit is no
less cannonick Scripture, then the prophecies of the immediately inspired
Prophets, who saw the visions of God, and therefore 2 Pet. 1. 16, 17, 18, the
voice that the Apostles heard from heaven, This is my beloved Sonn^ in whom I
am well pleased, is made equal with the word of proph^cie and prophetical
Scripture, which the holy men of God spale, ^ they were moved by the holy
Ghost, v. 19, 20, 21. and 2 Pet. 3. 16. Paul's Epistles are put in the class
with other Scriptures, v. 15, 16. now all Scripture, 2 Timothy 3. 16. is given by
divine inspiration, and 2 Peter 3. 2. puteth the words of the Prophets and
Apostles in the same place of divine authority, 2 Pet. 3. 2. That ye be
mindful of the words which were spoken before, by the holy Prophets, and of
the commandments of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior, whence to me
this synodicall consultation is not Apostolical, but such as is obligatory of
the Churches to the end of the world, and a pattern of a general Synod.

6. This assembly is led by the holy Spirit, as is clear, v. 25. 28. but this
is not the holy Spirit immediately inspiring the Apostles as Apostles, but that
ordinary Synodicall spirit (to borrow that expression) that is promised to all
the faithful pastors and rulers of the Church to the end of the world: because
the immediately inspiring spirit coming on Prophets and Apostles in an
immediate inspiration, did necessitate the Prophets and Apostles to acquiesce,
and prophecy, and to do and speak whatsoever this spirit inspired them to
do, and to speak: but this spirit spoken of, v. 28. does not so, but leaves
the assembly to a greater liberty, because the assembly does not acquiesce to
that which Peter says from Gods Word, v. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. nor does the
Assembly acquiesce to what Barnabas and Paul says, v. 12. but only to that
which James says, v. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. but especially to his conclusion
which he draws from the Law of nature, not to give scandal, and from the
Scriptures cited by himself, and by Peter, v. 19, 20. Wherefore my sentence
is, says James, etc. and this clearly is the sentence of James as a member of
the Synod, v. 19. (...), which is an expression clearly insinuating that the
judgment of James, though it was not contrary to that which Peter, Paul, and
Barnabas had spoken, yet that is was somewhat diverse from them, and more
particular, and the very mind of the holy Ghost which the whole Synod followed;
and therefore though Peter and Paul spoke truth, yet did they not speak that
truth, which did compose the controversy, and this is to me an argument that
they all spoke, as members of the Synod, and not as Apostles.

7. The immediately inspired Apostolic Spirit, though it may discourse and
infer a conclusion from such and such premises, as Paul does, Romans 3. 28.
and he proves from the Scripture, Romans 4. 4. 5. 6. that we are justified by
says without works, and 1 Timothy 5. 17. 18. and Act. 9. 22. Act. 24. 14. 17.
and so does Christ reason and argument from Scripture, Matthew. 22. 31. Luke 24.
25, 26, 27. and so have both the Prophets and Apostles argued, yet the
immediately inspired Spirit of God in arguing does not take help by disputing
one with another. and yet does not obtain the conclusion in hand, but here
Pe^^^ and Paul argue from Scripture, and they prove indeed a true conclusion
that the Gentiles should not keep Moses his Law, as they would be saved, yet
they did not remove the question, nor satisfic the consciences of the Churches,
in their present practice, for if James had not said more, then the Churches
had not been sufficiently directed in their practice by the Synod, and for all
that Peter and Paul said, the Churches might have ea^^n meats offered to
Idols, and blood, and things strangled, which at that time had been a sin
against the Law of nature, and a great stumbling block, and a scandalizing of
the Jews. Except therefore we say that the Apostles intending as Apostles to
determine a controversy in the Church, they did not determine it, which is an
injury to that immediately inspiring spirit that led the Apostles in penning
Scripture, we must say that Peter, Paul, and James here spoke as members of an
eccle^iasticall Synod, for the Churches after-imitation.

8. If the Apostles here as Apostles give out this decree, then it would seem
that as Apostles, by virtue of the immediately inspiring spirit, they sent
messengers to the Churches, for one spirit directs all, and by this Text, we
should have no warrant from the Apostles practice, to send messengers to
satisfy the consciences of the Churches, when they should be troubled with
such questions: now all our Divines and reason does evince that a Synod may by
this Text send messengers to resolve doubting Churches, in points dogmaticall;
for what the Apostles do as Apostles, by that power by which they writ
canonick Scripture, in that we have no warrant to imitate them.

9. I propounded another argument before, which prevails much with me; The
Elders of an ordinary Presbytery and Churches, such as conveened at this Synod
cannot be collateral actors with the immediately inspired Apostles for the
penning of Canonick Scripture, but in this Synod not only Elders, but the
whole Church, as our reverend brethren teach, were actors in penning this
decre, Act. 15. 28. Ergo, this decree is Synodicall, not Apostolic. I have
heard some of our reverend brethren say, all were not actors in the decree,
pari gradu authoritatis, with a like degree: and equal authority, every one
according to their place did concur in forming this decree. I answer, it
cannot be said that all in their own degree saw the visions of God, and all
in their own degree were immediately inspired to be penmen of Canonick
Scripture, for Paul in penning this, The cloak that I left at Troas bring with
thee, and the Parchmen^s, was no less immediately inspired of God, then were
the Prophets, who saw the visions of God, and then when he penned the, 1 Timothy
1. 15. That Jesus Christ came into the world to s^^^ sinners; except we flee
to a Popish distinction which Duvallius and Jesuits hold, that all and every
part, tota Scriptura, and totum Scripturae, is not given by divine inspiration,
because (say they) the Apostles spoke and wrote some things in the New
Testament as immediately inspired by God, as did the Prophets, but they spoke
and wrote other things (...) necessary, with an inferior and Apostolic or
Synodica^^ spirit, which the Pe^e and Church may decree in Synods to ^ee
received with the like faith and subjection of conscience, as if the Apostles
had written them. 2. You must say there was two holy (...) the penning of the
decree, one immediately inspiring the Apostles, another inferior assisting the
Elders; or at (...) diverse and most different acts of that same ho^y (...) way
inspiring the Apostles, and in a fallible way, inspiring the Elders. But with
your leave, Act. 21. 24. The ordinary I^es^ytery at Jerusalem, by that same
Synodicall spirit, by which they or^aine Paul to purify himself, do ascribe
to themselves this decree, v. 25. 3. We desire a warrant from Gods Word, of
commixion of immediately inspired Apostles as immediately inspired with Elders,
assisted with an ordinary spirit, for the p^^ning of Scripture.

10. We think the Presbytery of Jerusalem as an ordinary Presbytery, Act. 21.
18. and contradivided from the Church of Jrusalem, v. 22. The multitude must
needs come together, for they hear that thou art come, did ordain Paul to
purify himself, and it is clear Paul otherwise would not have purified
himself, and therefore he did not by the immediately inspired spirit purify
himself, and obey their decree, which was grounded upon the Law of nature, not
to scandalize weak believers, v. ^0, 21. and bt this same holy spirit did Paul
with other of the Apostles write this decree, as is clear v. 25.

11. If the Apostles did all in this Synod as immediately inspired by God, then
should the Synod have followed the determination of any one Apostle, of Peter
and Paul, as well as of (...), for the immediately inspiring spirit is alike
perfect in all ^^s determinations, but it is said expressly, v. 22. (...), etc.
Then it seemed good to the Apostles, etc. and so to (...), and Peter, and Paul,
to follow the sentence of James, (...) the rest of the Apostles; now if James
spoke as an immediately inspired Apostle, and not by virtue of that Synodicall
Spirit given to all faithful Pastors conveened in a lawful Synod, then should
James have acquiesced to what Peter and Paul aid, and not to what he said
himself, and Peter should have acquiesced to what he said, and Paul to what
he said, ^^ every inspired writer is to obey what the immediately inspiring
Spirit says, and then there was no reason why the Synod should rather
acquiesce to what Peter and Paul said who spoke of no abstinence from blood and
things strangled, then to what James said, Ergo, by the Apostles consequence,
v. 24. ( we gave ^^ such commandment, that you must be circumcised, Ergo, you
should not be circumcised) so this consequence is good, Peter and Paul
speaking as Apostles gave no commandment in this Synod to abtaine from blood,
Ergo, by the like consequence the Synod was not to command n^ abstinence from
blood, which consequence is absurd, Ergo, they command not here as Apostles, 2.
The Synod should have been left in the midst to doubt, whether shall we follow
Paul and Peter, who speak and command n^ abstinence from blood and things
strangled, o^ shall we follow James, who commands to abstain from blood and
things (...), for all here command as immediately inspired Apostles, and what
the Apostles judge lawful and command as Apostles, that must the Churches
follow, and what they command not, that by an immediately inspiring Spirit they
command not, as is clear, v. 24. and that also must the Churches not follow,
therefore I think we must say they did not here speak as Apostles.

12. These words, v. 24. Some who pervert your souls say, you must be
circumcised, and keep the Law, to whom we gave no such commandment) do
clearly hold forth what the Apostles as Apostles command in Gods worship that
the Churches must do, what the Apostles as Apostles command not, in Gods
worship, that the Churches must not do whence they teach, 1. That an
Apostolic commandment of any one Apostle without any Synod might have
determined the question, to what use then does a Synod conduce? Ergo, certainly
either the Synod was convened for no use, which is contrary to Gods Word, Act.
25. 2. 6. Act. 16. 4. 5. it served to resolve the controversy and edify the
Churches, Act. 16. 4. They delivered them the decrees, etc. 5. And so the
Churches were established in the says, and increased in number daily, or then
the Synodicall commandment, and so the Synodicall spirit spoken of v. 28. must
be some other thing then the Apostolical commandment, and the immediately
inspiring spirit. 2. The Apostles gave no positive commandment to keep Moses
his Law as Apostles, nay nor to keep any part of it, they did not as Apostles
forbid, before this Synod, that the Gentiles should abstain from blood, and
things strangled, which were Mosaicall Laws before this Synod, yet now they
give a commandment to keep some Mosaicall Laws, in the case of scandal;
hence we must either judge that now as Apostles they command in positive
commandments the keeping of Moses his Law, contrary to what they say, for
their not commanding to keep Moses his Law is a commanding not to keep it,
(observe this) or then their commandment here is but synodicall and so far
binding as the case of scandal stands in vigor, which certainly a Synod may
command, and one Church may injoyne, by way of counsel, to another, for
otherwise as Apostles forbidding scandal, which is spiritual homicide, they
forbid also eating of blood, in that case when it stood indifferent. 3. The
Apostles saying, To whom we gave no such commandment, they clearly insinuate
that their commandment as Apostles de jure, should have ended the
controversy, but now for the edification and after-example of the Churches
they took a Synodicall way.

13. The way of the Apostles speaking seems to me Synodicall, and not given
out with that divine and Apostolical authority, that the Apostles may use in
commanding: it is true, they use lovely and swasory exhortations in their
writing, but this is a (...) a decree, not an exhortation, now James says, 1^.
(...), and (...) is set down as his private opinion, with reverence to what
Peter and Paul says, and v. 7. Peter when many had disputed and spoken before
him, stands up and speaks, and v. 12. Barnabas and Paul, after the
multitude is ^^nt does speak, which to me is a Synodicall order, and the
whole Synod, v. 28. say, It seemed good to us.

They answer. 1. Consociated Churches have some power in determining of
dogmaticall points, but this is no power of jurisdictim.

The seventh Proposition to which almost all the Elders of New England agreed,
says; The Synod bath no Church Power, but the cause enimeth with the Church.
Corpus cum causa, the Church-body, and the cause which concerns the
Church-body, do remain together, and therefore quaestio defertur ad Synodum,
causa manet penes eccleiam, the question is brought to the Synod, the cause
remains with the Church. Another Manuscript of Godly and learned Divines I
saw, which says; That the ministerial power of applying of the rules of the
word and Canons to persons and things from time to time, as the occasions of
the Church shall require, pertains to, and may be exercised by each
particular Church, without any necessary dependence on other Churches, yet in
difficill cases we ought (say they) to consult with, and seek advise from
presbyteries and ministers of (...) Churches, and give so much authority to a
concurrence of judgments as shall, and ought to be an obligation to us, not to
depart from any such resolutions, as they shall make upon any consideration but
where in conscience, and hence our peace with God is apparently concerned.

Answ. I perceive, 1. That our brethren cannot endure that a Synod should be
called a Church; but 1. I verily think that when Paul and Barnabas, Act. 15.
1, 2. had much dissension with those who taught, you must be circumcised after
the manner of Moses, that the Church of Antioch resolved to tell the Church,
that is the Synod, while as they fall upon this remedy, v. 2. They determined
that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them, (...) go up to Jerusalem
unto the Apostles and Elders, about this question, that is, that the Church of
Antioch, (when the subver^ers of souls would not hear their brethren of
Antioch) did tell the Synod convened at Jerusalem, that is, according to our
^viours order, Ma^^^. 18. 17. they did tell the Church: and my reason is, if
the Church at Antioch could not satisfy the con^c^en^es of some who said, you
must be circumcised, else you cann^x in saved, they could not, nor had they
power, in that cast not to go on, but were obliged to tell the Synod, that is,
the Church, whom it concerned as well as Antioch: for if they had sent the
matter to the Synod as a question, not as a cause proper to the Synod, or
Church; then when the Synod had resolved the question, the cause should have
returned to the Church of Antioch, and been determined at Antioch, as in the
proper court, if that hold true, the question is deserred to the Synod, the
cause remains with the body, the Church; but the cause returned never to the
Church of Antioch, but both question and cause was determined by the
Synodicall-Church, Act. 15 v. 22. 23, 24. and the determination of both
question and cause ended in the Synod, as in a proper court, and is imposed as
a commandment and a Synodicall Canon, to be observed both by Antioch, v. 25,
26, 27, 28, 29. and other Churches, Act. 16. 4, 5. Ergo, either the Church of
Antioch lost their right, and yet kept Christ's order, Matthew. 18. 15, 16, 17. or
the question and cause in this case belongs to a Synod. 2. It is said
expressly, ^. 22. It pleased t^ Apostles, Elders, and the whole Church to send
chosen men of their own company to Antioch, etc. What Church was this? the
whole Church of ^^leevers, or the fiaternitie at Jerusalem; (say our brethren)
but with leave of their godliness and learning no, say ^. 1. What reason that
the Church of all believers men and women of Jerusalem, should de jure, have
been present to give either consent or surfrage there: because it concerned
then practice and conscience, but I say it concerned as much, if not more, the
conscience and practice of the Church of Antioch, if not more, for the cause
was theirs (say our brethen) and cause ad corpus (say they) quaestio ad
synodum, and it concerned as much the practice and conscience of all the
Churches, who were to observe these decrees, Act 16. 4. 5 Act. 21. 25. yet they
were not present. If the multitude of ^^leevers of Jerusalem was present,
because they were (...) to the Synod, whereas Antioch and other (...) were nor
off, were not present, but in their commissioners, then I say the Church ^^ the
multitude of Jerusalem, whose commidic^^^s were here (...); I say the multitude
was present ^uely de (...) not (...) nor was there more law for their presence,
then ^or all other Churches, who also in conscience were obliged to obey the
counsels determinations: but I, dear a warrant that the fact of the Synod,
such as was sending of the decrees and Commissioners with the decrees to
Antioch, should be ^^^^ibed to the multitude of believers at Jerusalem, who by
no Law of God were present at the Synod, and by no Law of God (...) more
consent then the Church of Antioch, and were present (...) (...), and by
accident, because they dwelt in the (...) where the Synod did sit, therefore
say I, the (...) Church in the whole Synod. 2. By what Law can Jerusalem a
sister Church have influence or consent de jure, in sending binding Acts, as
these were, as is clear, v. 28. Chapter 16. 4, 5. Chapter 21. 25. to the Church of
Antioch? for this is an authoritative sending of messengers, and the Canons to
the Church of Antioch, as is evident, v. 2 2. 3. It is utterly denied that the
Church of Jerusalem, I mean the multitude of believers, could meet all at one
Synod. 4. The word (...), v. 12. which is said to hold their peace, is referred
to the Apostles and Elders met Synodically, v. 6. and is not the multitude of
believers. 5. Where are these who are called Elders, not Apostles, they are
ever distinguished from the Apostles, as Act. 15. 2. v. 6. v. 22. Act. 16. 4.
Act. 21. 18. 25. ^are is no reason that they were all Elders of Jerusalem, for
(...) can Elders of one sister Church impose Laws, burdens, ^28 and (...)
decrees, Chapter 16. 4. upon sister Churches? or h^w can they pen canonical
Scripture jointly with the Apostles? Some of our brethren say so much of those
degrees, that they obliged formally the Churches as Scriptures do oblige: the
learned Junius says well, that the Apostles did nothing as Apostles where
there was an ordinary and established Eldery^^ in the Church; therefore those
Elders behoved to be the (...) of Antioch, for Act. 17. v. 2. (...)
Commissioners were (...) from Antioch then Paul and (...). I think also the
Churches of Cyria and (...) (...) there, as well as Antioch, and de jure, (...)
should have been there; The case was theirs every way the same with the Church
of Antioch, and their souls subverted, v. 24. 6. Those who are named v. 22.
Apostles, Elders, and the whole Church are called v. 25. Apostles, and Elders,
and Brethren, and elsewhere always Apostles and Elders (Elders including
brethren, or the whole Church, v. 22. of some chosen men, and brethren) as Act.
13. 2. v. 6. Chapter 16. 4. Act. 21. 18. 25.

2. I desire to try what truth is here, that this Synod but power and
authority in points dogmaticall, but no Church Power (says the seventh
proposition of the reverend and godly Brethren of New England) and no power of
jurisdiction, but the Church of Antioch had Church Power and power of
jurisdiction to determine this cause and censure the contraveeners, as our
Brethren say. But I assume, this Synod took this Church Power off their hand,
and with the joint power of their own Commissioners sent from Antioch, v. 2.
v. 22. 23. determined both cause and controversy, and it never returned to any
Church-Court at Antioch, as is clear, v. 25, 26, 27, 28. Ergo, this Synod had
a Church Power. 2. A power and authority dogmaticall to determine in matters
of doctrine is a Church Power proper to a Church, as is granted by our
brethren, and as we prove from, Act. 20. 29. This is a part of the oversight
committed to the Eldership of Ephesus, to take heed to men rising amongst
themselves speaking perverse things, that is, teaching false doctrine; and if
they watch over them, as members of their Church (for they were v. 30. men of
their own) they were to censure them. 2. If Pergamus be rebuked, Re^el. 2.
14. 15. and threatened with the removing of their Candlestick, because they had
amongst them those who held the doctrine of Balaam, and the doctrine of the
Nicolaitans, hated by Christ himself, and did not use the power of
jurisdiction against them* then that Church which has power dogmaticall to
judge of doctrine, has power also of jurisdiction to censure those who hold
the false doctrine of Balaam, and v. 20. Christ says to Thyatira.
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, (...) because thou suff^^^
that woman Jesabel, which calls herself a Prophetess, to teach and to
sedu^e my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrif^^d to
Idols. Hence I argue, what Church has power to try the false doctrine of
Jesabel, and is blamed for not censuring her, but permits her to teach and
to seduce the servants of God, has also power of jurisdiction against her
false doctrine: this poposition I take to be evident in those two Churches of
Pergamus and Thyatira. I assume: but this Synod, Act. 15. has authority and
power to condemn the false doctrine taught by subverters of souls, teaching a
necessity of circumcision, in the Churches of Syria, Cilicia, Antioch, etc.
Act. 15. verse. 23, 24. Therefore this Synod has power of jurisdiction.

3. Every society which has power to lay on burdens as here this Synod has,
v. 28. and to send decrees to be observed by the Churches, as Act. 16. 4. and
to send and conclude, that they observe no such thing, and that they observe
such and such things, Act. 21. 25. by the power of the holy Ghost, conveened in
an Assembly, 25. and judging according to Gods Word, as ^. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
etc. these have power of juridiction to censure the contraveners: but this
Synod is such a society, Ergo, it has this power. The Proposition is, Matthew.
18. 18. If he refuse to hear the Church, let him be to thee as a heathen and
a publican; nothing can be answered here, but because this Synod commands
only in a brotherly way, but by no Church Power, therefore they have no power
of jurisdiction. But with reverence of these learned men, this is, petitio
principii, to beg what is in question; for the words are clear, a brotherly
counsel and advise is no command, no (...), no decree which we must observe,
and by the observing whereof the Churches are established in the faith, as is
said of these decrees, Act. 16. 4, 5. To give a brotherly counsel, such as
Abigail gave to David, and a little maid gave to Namaan, is not a burden laid
on by the commander; but it is said of this decree, v. 28. (...), It seemed
good to the holy Ghost to lay no other burden on you.

Also we do not say that power of jurisdiction is in provincial or national
Synods as in the Churches, who have power to excommunicate; for 1. this power
of jurisdiction in Synods is cumulative, not privative; 2. It is in the Synod
quoad actus imperatos, potius quam act us elicitos, according to commanded
rather then to elicit acts, for the Synod by an ecclesiastical power added to
that intrinsecall power of jurisdiction in Churches, does command the Churches
to use their power of jurisdiction rather then use it actually her self. Let
me also make use of two propositions agreed upon in a Synod at New England.
Their 3. proposition. The fraternity have an authoritative concurrence with
the Preshyteny, in judicial Acts. 4. Proposition. The fraternity in an
Organicall body, actu subordinate, id est, per modum obedientiae, in
subordination by way of obedience to the Presbytery in such judicial Acts, 2
Cor. 10. 6. Now if here the whole Church of Jerusalem, as they say from v. 22.
was present, and joined their authoritative concurrence to these decrees, there
was here in this Synod an Organicall body of eyes, ears, and other members,
that is, of Apostles, Teachers, Elders and people, and so a formed Church by
our brethrens doctrine, ^^gs, Paul and Barnabas, v. 2. being sent to this Synod
by the Church of Antioch to complain, were sent to tell the formed and
organicall Churches, as it is Matthew. 18 19 which is a good argument, if not
(...), as Aristotle says, yet (...) 2. If the Brethren here concur as giving
obedience to the Elders, and the Apostles do here determine as Apostles and
Elders, then the brothren in this Organicall body do concur to the forming
of these decrees by way of obedience to the Elders ^ Presbyters, and by the
same reason the Elders concur by way of obedience to the Apostles, for as the
Elders as Elders and above the fraternity, so the Apostles as Apostles are
above the Elders: but then I much wonder how the acts are called the decrees of
the Apostles and Elders jointly, Act. 16. 4. and how the Elders of Jerusalem
do ascribe those decrees to themselves, Act. 21. 25. and how all the assembly
speak as assisted by the holy Ghost, Act. 15. 28. Shall we distinguish where
the Scripture does not only not distinguish, but does clearly hold forth
quality and an identitie?

But some object, that the holy Ghost, v. 28. is the immediately instiring
Apostolic Spirit^ and so the Apostles must here concur in giving out those
decrees as Apostles, not as ordinary Elders. 1. Is Peter and Paul allege
Scripture and testimonies of Gods Spirit in this Syned, as Elders, not as
Apostles, then they reason in the Synod as falli^^ men, and men who may err,
but that is impossible; for if they (...) Scripture, as men who may err, the
Scripture which they al^^dge (...) be fallible.

Answ. Though the Apostles here reason as Elders, not as Ap^st^^s, I see no
inconvenience to say they were men who might ^re, though as led with the holy
Ghost, they could not err in this Syned following the conduct of the holy
Ghost, as is said, ^. 28. though the holy Ghost there be only the ordinary
holy Ghost given to all the Pastors of Christ assembled in Gods name and the
authority of Jesus Christ, yet in this Act and as led by this Spirit, they
were not fallible, neither men who could err: for I see not how ordinary
believers as led in such and such Acts by the holy Ghost, and under that
reduplication can err, for they err as men in whom there is flesh and a body
of corruption, and therefore, though both Apostles and Elders, modaliter, might
err, as Logic says; Aposta^^s err are est possible, yet de facto, in this
they could not err, being led by the holy Ghost, v. 28. and the necessity of
their not erring is not absolute, but necessary by consequent, because the
Spirit of God led them, as v. 28. But the reason is must, weak, if they might
err, Ergo, the Scripture they allege might be fallible: for though heretics
allege Scripture, and abuse it, and make it to be no Scripture, but their
own fancy, while as they allege it to establish blasphemous conclusions, yet
does it no way follow that Scripture can be fallible, or obnoxious to error,
but only that abused and a^^ applved Scripture is not Scripture.

Object. 2. If ever the Apostles were led by an infallible spirit, (...) to be
in a matter like this, which so much concerned the (...) and consciences of all
the Christian Churches amongst the Gen(...): E^go, in this Synod they could not
be led by a fallible spirit, but ^^ an infallible, and so by an Apostolic
Spirit.
Answ. I conceive the spirit which led both Apostles and Elders in this Synod,
was an infallible Spirit, but Ergo, an immediately inspiring and Apostolic
Spirit, it follows not; yea the holy Ghost of which Luke does speak, v. 28.
as the president and leader of this first mould of all Synods, and so the most
perfect Synod, is never fallible, no not in the meanest believer, and it were
blasphemy to say the holy Ghost in any can be obnoxious to error; and I
think de facto, neither Apostles nor Elders could err in this Synod, because,
de fact^, they followed the conduct of the holy Ghost, without any byas in
judgment; but it follows not, 1. that the men could not err, because the
holy Ghost leading the men could not err, as we answer Papists who produce
this same argument to prove that general counsels, and so the Church must be
infallible. 2. It follows not, Ergo, this holy Ghost was that immediately
inspiring and Apostolic Spirit leading both Apostles and Elders, which is the
question now in hand.

Object. 3. This is a pattern of all lawful Synods, then may all lawful
Synods say; It seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to us: if therefore the men
might err, the leader, to wit, the holy Ghost might err, which is absurd.
Answ. It follows only that all lawful Synods should so proceed, as they
may say, It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us, and there is a wide
difference betwixt Law and Fact, all are lawful Synods conveened in the name
and authority of Christ, and so by warrant of the holy Ghost speaking in his
Word; but it follows not (as Papists infer, and this argument proves) that
therefore all which de facto, those lawfully assembled Synods do and conclude,
that they are the doings and conclusions of the holy Ghost, and that in them
all, they may say, It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us. 2. The
consequence is false and blasphemous, that if all lawfully conveened Synods may
not say, It seemed good to the holy Ghost and us, that therefore the holy Ghost
is fallible, and may err, but only that men in the Synod following their own
Ghost, and spirit, can say no more but, it seemed good to our Ghost and spirit,
and cannot say, it seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us: for an ordinary
Pastor lawfully called and preaching sound doctrine in the power and assistance
of Gods spirit does speak in that act from the holy Ghost, and yet because in
other acts, wherein with Nathan and Samuel he may speak with his own spirit,
see with his own eyes and light, it follows not that he is infallible, or
that the holy Ghost is infallible.

Object 4 Is the Apostles did not conclude in this Synod, what they (...) an Ap
s^a ^^k spirit, it shall follow that the holy Ghost (...) 15. 28. is not that
same holy Ghost of which Peter (...), 2 Pet. 1. 21. But holy men of God spoke
as they were moved (...) Ghost, and if so, that holy Ghost which spoke in the
Pro(...) not also speak in the Apostles.
Answ. I see no necessity of two holy Ghosts, 1 Cor. 12. 4. Now (...)
^^^^ersities of gifts, but the same Spirit, there be diverse acts of the same
holy Ghost, and I willingly contend that the Synodicall acts of Apostles and
Elders in this Synod, though coming from the holy Ghost assisting them as
Elders in an ordinary Synod, v. 28. are different from the acts of that same
holy Ghost as immediately inspiring the Prophets and Apostles in prophesying and
penning canonick Scripture; and yet there be not two holy Ghosts, for Paul did
not believe in Christ by that same spirit which immediately inspired him and the
rest of the Apostles and Prophets to write canonick Scripture. ^ mean it is
not the same operation of the Spirit, because Paul by the holy Ghost given to
all the faithful as Christians, and not given to them as canonical writers,
or as Apostles or immediately inspired Prophets does believe in Christ, love
Christ, contend for the prise of the high calling of God, as is clear Romans ^.
37, 38, 39. 1 Cor. 2. 12. 16. Phil. 3. 13. 14. 1 Cor. 9. 25. Yea Paul believes
not in Christ as an Apostle, but as a Christian, and yet he believes by the
grace of the holy Ghost; but ^^ follows not that the same spirit which
immediately inspired the Prophets does not immediately inspire Paul as an
Apostle, and all the rest of the Apostles.

Object. 5. These decrees, Act. 16. 4. are called the decrees of the Apostles
and Elders, but if the Apostles in giving out these decrees gave (...) as
ordinary Elders, not as Apostles, then the sense of the words, Act. 16. 4.
should be, that they were the decrees of the Elders and of the Elders, which
is absued.
Answ. It follows only that they are the decrees of the Apostles who in that
give them out as Elders, and as a part of the ordinary established Elders of
Jerusalem.

Whence if Christ promise the holy Spirit to lead his Apostles in all truth,
he promises also the holy Spirit to all their successors, Pastors, Teachers
and Elders, not only conveened in a Congregationall-Church, but also in a
Synod, as he makes good his promise here, Act. 15. 28. and whereas the holy
Ghost commands in a Synod of Apostles and Elders who are lawfully conveened,
by our brethrens confession, and speaks authoritatively Gods Word by the holy
Ghost, Act. 15. 28. they cannot speak it as a counsel and brotherly advise
only, for that a brother may do to another, a woman to a woman, Abigail to
David, a maid to Naaman: we desire a warrant from Gods Word, where an
instituted society of Pastors and Elders conveened from sundry Churches, and
in that Court formally consociated and decreeing by the holy Ghost, as Act. 15.
28. against such and such heresies, shall be no other then a counsel and
advise, and no Church-commandement, nor binding decree backed with this power:
He that despises you, speaking by the holy Ghost, the Word of God, despises
me, and whether doctrines, or canons concerning doctrine, coming from a
lawful Court, conveened in Christ's name, have no ecclesiastical power of
spiritual jurisdiction to get obedience to their lawful decrees; for if every
one of the suffrages of Elders be but a private counsel having only
authority objective from the intrinsecall lawfulness of the thing, and no
authority official from the Pastors, because Pastors, then the whole
conclusion of the Synod shall amount to no higher rate and sum then to a
mere advise and counsel. If it be said, that when they are all united in a
Synod, and speaking as assembled, Act. 15. 25. and speaking thus Assembled by
the holy Ghost, v. 28. the authority is more then a counsel, yet not a power
of Church-jurisdiction. Then 1. give us a warrant in Gods Word, for this
distinction. 2. We ask whether this authority being contemned, the persons
or Churches contemnibg it, be under any Church-censure, or not; if they be
under a Church-censure, what is this but that the Synod has power of censure,
and so power of jurisdiction? if you say non-communion is a sufficient censure.
But I pray you spare me to examine this; 1. If the sentence of non-Communion
be a sentence of (...). it must proceed from a judicature that has a (...) of
jurisdiction, but give me leave to say as all Church-(...) have and must have
warrant in Gods Word, so must (...), such as non-communion, for the ordinary
Church punishments, such as public rebu^ing have warrant in the Word, as in 1 Timothy 5. 20. and excommunication, 1 Cor. 5. 4. (...) 1^. and the great Anathema
Maranatha, 1 Cor. 16. 22. and forbearing to eat and drink with scandalous
persons, 1 Cor. 5. 10, 11. withdrawing from his company, 2 Th^s. 3. 14. and I
pray you where has the Word taught us of such a bastard (...)-ensure, or if
you will not allow it that name, a censure indicted by the Church or Churches,
as is non-communion. May our brethren without Christ's warrant shape any
punishment equivalent to excommunication without Gods Word? (...) they may as
well without the Word mould us such a censure as excommunication: if they say,
separation warrenth this censure of non-communion. But 2. By what Law of God
can an equal give out a sentence of non-communion a(...) an equal, an equal
cannot as an equal punish, when a Christian denies followship to another
because he is excommunicated, he does not punish as an equal, for the
punisher in this case denying fellowship to the excommunicated does (...) an
equal, but as having authority from the Church, who has given this
commandment in the very sentence of communication. 1 Cor. 5. 4. compared with
v. 10, 11. Separation under a great controversy, and denied in many cases ^^
the way of those who are more rigid therein, even by our (...).

2. Christ, Matthew. 18. 15, 16. will not have any brother, who (...) but private
authority and no Church-authoritie over a bro^^^^ (...) non habet potestatem)
to presently renounce (...) give up all communion with his brother, though he
be (...) before two or three witnesses, and inflict on him the sentence of
non-communion, while he first tell the Church, and non-communion is inflicted
on no man as if he were a heathen

(...) (to speak no thing of delivering to Satan) while he ^^ conveened and
judicially sentenced before the Church; (...) our brethrens sentence of
non-communion is in inflicted by an equal Church upon a ^^ster Church in a
mere p^^^^ way, and by no Church-proces.

4. Non-communion, if it be warranted by the law of ^^ture, as communion of
equals is, yet should we not be refused of the like favor, when we plead
that the Law of nature pleads for combination and communion of joint
authorities of s^s^er-Churches, in one presbytery: for if non-communion of
Churches be of the law of nature, so must communion of Churches, and
authoritative communion, and authoritative and judicial non-communion, by
natures law must be as warrantable upon the same grounds.

They 6. Object. ^ the Apostles, were in this Synod as ordinary Elders th^n,
The Synod might have censured, and in case of obs^inacie excommunicated the
Apostles which were admirable.
Answ. For re^ukeing of Apostles we have against Papists a memorable warrant
in Paul, Gal. 2. withstanding Peter to ^ce face, and Peter his giving an
account, Act. 11 1, 2, 3. to the Church of Jerusalem of his going in to the
Gentiles, which Parker acknowledges against Papists and Prelates to be a note
of Peter's subjection to the Church. Papists say it was Peter's humility; other
Papists say Peter gave but such a brotherly account to the Church, such as one
brother is obliged to give to another: also all our Divines, and those Papists
who contend that the Pope is inferior to universal councels. doc with good
warrant allege that by Matthew. 18. Peter is subjected to the Church Censures,
if he sin against his brother, and therefore we doubt not, but the Church
has, jus, law to excommunicate the Apostles, in case of obstinacy, and would
have used this power i^ Judas had lived now when the power of excommunication
was in vigor; but we say withal, de facto, the su^position was unpossible in
respect that continued and habitual obstinacy, and flagitious and at^ocious
scandals deserving excommunication, were inconsistent with that measure of the
holy Spirit bestowed upon those Catholic Organs and vessels of mercy: but this
exempteth the Apostles from act all excommunication, de facto, but is our
brethren ex^^pt them, a jure, from the Law, they transform the Apostles into
Popes, above all Law, which we cannot do, Apostolic eminency does (...)
neither Peter nor Paul to be above either the (...) the (...) Law, or the
positive Laws gi(...) One does wittily say on these (...) Matthew. 8. 15. The
Pope is either a (...) if he be a brother offending, (...) complain of him
to the Church, (...) be no brother, there is an end (...) his father, and never
after this (...)

(...) in a Synod as Apostles, does not (...) in Apostolic acts could not use
Sy(...) others; 1. Because Daniel, 9. 2. (...) understood by books the number(...)
Lord came to Jeremiah the (...) Paul. 1 Cor. 1. 1. and Timothi(...) and (...),
1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. and 3. The (...), and yet ^ oph^ts and Apostles were immedi(...)
which they ^^ote and spoke.

Answ. 1. Daniel ^^d the Prophecy of Jeremiah, and the Pro(...) the books of
Moses, and the Apostles read the old Testament, (...) and Paul read ^eathen
Poets, and cites them, Act. 17. (...). Ti^. 1. 12. and makes them Scripture.

2. But the question is now, if as Prophets and immediately in^^^ Prophets and
Apostles they did so consult with Scripture which they read, as they made any
thing canoni^k Scripture upon (...) medium, and formal reason, because they
did read it, (...) it out of books, and not because the immediate i^^piration
of the holy Ghost taught them, what they should (...) canonick Scripture.
Suppone a sentence of a ^eathen (...) suppone this, that Paul left his cloak
at Tro^s, not the ^^^wledge of sense, not natural reason, not experience, none
^^ these can be a formal medium, a formal mean to make scripture but as, (
thus says Jehovah in his word) is the formal reason why the Church believes
the Scripture to be the Word ^^ God, so the formal reason that makes Prophets
and Apostles to put down any truth, as that which is formally canonical
scripture, whether it be a supernatural truth, as, the (...) was made flesh,
or a moral truth, as, Children obey your (...), or a natural truth, as The
Ox knows his owner, or an experienced truth, as make not friendship with an
angry (...) a truth of heathen morality, as, me are the offspring of God, or
a truth of sense, Paul lest his clo^ke at T^oas, I say the (...), formal
reason that makes it divine and Scripturall truth is the immediate inspiration
of God, therefore though (...) learned by books that the captivity should
endure seventi. years, yet his light by reading made it not formally
Scripture, but Daniels putting it in the Canon by the immediate acti^r,
impulsion, and inspiration of the holy Spirit; and though Matthew did read in
Esaiah, A Virgin shall conceive and beared Son, yet Matthew makes it not a
part of the New Testament, because Esaiah said it, but because the holy Ghost
did imdiatly suggest it to him, as a divine truth: for a holy man might draw
out of the Old and New Testament a Chapter of orthodox truths, all in Scripture
words, and believe them to be Gods truth, yet that Chapter should not formally
be the Scriptur. of God, because though the Author did write it by the light
of faith, yet the Prophetical and Apostolical spirit did not suggest it and
inspire it to the author. I know some School^. Papists have a distinction here.
They say there be some sepernaturall truths in Scriptures, as predictions of
things that tall out by the mediation of contingent causes, and the
supernatural mysteries of the Gospel, as that Achab shall be killed in the
wars, the Messiah shall be borne, etc. Christ came to (...) sinners, and those
were written by the immediately inspiring Spirit: others were but historical
and natural truths of fact, as that Paul wrought miracles, that he left his
cleake at Troas, and these latter are written by an inferior spirit, the
assisting, not the immediately inspiring Spirit, and by this latter spirit (say
they) much of Scripture was written; and from this assisting Spirit comes the
traditions of the Church (say they) and the decrees of Popes and counsels; and
this holy Spirit though infallible, may and does use disputation,
consultations, counsels of Doctors, reading; but we answer that what
counsels determine by an assisting spirit is not Scripture, nor yet ^m-ply
infallible, nor does Daniel advise with Jeremialis writing what he shall put
down as Scripture, nor Paul with Sos^h^^^^, with Timothy and Silvamus, what
he shall write as Canonick Scripture in his Epistles, for then as the decrees
of the coun(...) at Jerusalem are called the decrees of the Apostles and Elders
and this decree which comes from the Apostles and Elders assem^led with one
accord, and speaking with joint suffrages from the holy Ghost, v. 7, 8 9, 10,
etc. v. 28. as collateral authors of the decree, is the conclusion of Apostles
and Elders; so also should the proph^cie of Daniel, at least the first two
verses of the ninth chapter, be a part of Daniel, and a part of Jeremi^hs
prophecy, and Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians should be the Epistle of Paul
and S^sthe^es, and his Epistles to the Colossians, and Thessah^ian^, the
Epistles of Paul, of Timothy, of Silvanus, whereas Sosthenes, Timothy, Silvanus
were not immediately inspired collateral writers of these Epistles with Paul,
but only joyners with him in the salutation.

The erring and scandalous Churches are in a hard condition, if they cannot be
edified by the power of jurisdiction in presbyteries.

Object. But it never or seldom in a century falls out, that a Church is to
be excommunicated, and Christ has provided Laws for things only that fall
out ordinarily.
Answ. It is true, we see not how an whole Church can be formally convented,
accused, excommunicated, as one or two brethren may be, in respect all are
seldom or never deserted of God to fall into an atrocious scandal, and wilful
obstinacy, yet this freeth them not from the Law: as suppose in a Congregation
of a thousand, if five hundredth be involved in libertinisme, are they freed,
because they are a multitude, from Christ's Law? or from some positive
punishment by analogy answering to excommunication? 2. The Eldership of a
Congregation being three only, does not seldom scandalously offend, and are
they under no power under heaven? The people may withdraw from them says the
Synod of New England, what then? so may I withdraw from any who walks
inordinately, 2. These. 3. 14. 15. (3) It is not well said that Christ gives no
Laws for sins that seldom fall out. What say you of Anathema Maranatha, 1
Cor. 16. 22. to be used against an Apostate from the faith, and against such
as fall into the sin against the holy Ghost? I think visible professors
capable both of the ^nne and the censure, yet I think it falls seldom out,
it fell seldom but that an Apostle was to be rebuked, ha^ Paul then no law to
rebuke Peter. Gal. 2.

Object. 2. A Synod or presbytery may pr^nounce the d^^dfull sentence of
non-communion against persons and Churches (...).
Answ. But I ask, where is the power, and institution from Christ, that one
private man, as he may counsel his brother, so he may by our brethrens
grounds, pronounce this sentence.

Object. 3. One private man may not do it, to a whole Church, ^^ a classical
Presbytery and a Synod has more authority over him, then he has over them.
Answ. One private man may rebuke another, yea be may plead with his mother
the whole Church, that he lives in, for her whoredoms, Hos. 2. 2. But if he
justly plead and his mother will not hear, may he not separate? Our brethren
of New England, I think, shall be his warrant to separate; for their sixth
Synodicall proposition says, the fraternity, and people are to separate from
the Eldership, after they refuse wholesome counsel. Now what Scripture
warranteth twenty to withdraw and separate, shall also warrant ten, and five,
and one, for no reason that if twenty be careless of their salvation in the
duty of separation, and shall not separate, that one man shall not separate;
because a multitude does evil, I am not to do evil with them.

Object. 4. But a Synod or a classical presbytery has more (...) and
authority, then one private man, or one single Congregation. 1. Because they
are a company of Elders, to whom, as to the Priests of the Lord, whose lips
should preserve knowledge, the ^^yes of knowledge, and consequently a power and
Synodicall authority is given, though they have no power of jurisdiction. 2.
Because as a private man's power is inferior to a Pastors, so is the power of
classical and Synodioall meeting of Elders above a man, or a single
congregation; and a Synod, in dogmaticall power, arises so higher then these,
^^ divine institution does fall upon it.
Answ. The power of order and the key of knowledge does elevate a Pastor, whose
lips does preserve knowledge, above a private Christian, yea as I conceive
above a multitude of believers; but I would know if a Synods dogmaticall power
be above the power of single congregations; I think it is not, by our
brethrens ^enents, for they say expressly Church. government. Answ. to qu. 14.
page 43, 44.
that every particular (...), jus, to decide dogmaticall points, and this ^ight
the Church of Antioch had, Act. 15. and labored to end that (...) in her
self, which shows that they had right and ^ we, but they had not ability,
and therefore in that case, they (...), light and advise from other Churches,
and they say lb Answ. ^^ q. 18. page 64 So Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson against
Mr. Herlo, c. 2.
The c^niociation of Churches into classes and Synods, we (...) to be
lawful, and in some cases necessary; as namely in things (...) not peculiar to
one Church, but common to all. And likewise when a Church is not able to end
any matter, that concerns only themselves, the^ they are to seek advise and
counsel from neighbor Churches: hence the power of Synods is only by way of
counsel and advise, and a Pastors advise is but an advise, and he gives not
his advise, virtute (...), as he is a Pastor, for then his advise should be
pastoral and auth^^itative, and proceeding from the power of order, though not
from the power of jurisdiction; he only gives his advise as a gifted and
enlightened man, and so, to my poor knowledge, two hundredth, five hundredth holy
and learned Pastors determining in a Synod any dogmaticall point, they sit all
there not as in a court, not as Pastors, for then their Decrees should have
pastoral authority, and some power formally ministerial to determine, yea
and to sway, in a ministerial way, by power of the keys of knowledge, all the
inferior Churches, whom the decree concerns, even as the Eldership of
Perg^mus, which to our brethren is a congregationall Church, does decree by the
dogmaticall power of the keys of knowledge that the doctrine of Balaam is a
false doctrine, therefore they sit there as gifted Christians, and so have no
Church Power more then a private brother or sister of the Congregation has
toward, or over another: for though a multitude of counselling and advising
friends be safer and more effectual to give light, then a counselling friend,
yet are they but a multitude of counselling friends, and the result of all
counselling and advising men does never rise higher then a counsel and advise,
and can never amount to the nature of a command: as twenty sch^^^-fellowes,
suppose as ^udent and wise as the twenty masters of an Universitie, if these
twenty schoole-fellowes give their advise and counsel (...) a weighty
business that concerns the practice and obedience of all the students, the
result of their counsel and advise can never be more then an advise, and
cannot amount to the same determination of the twenty masters of the
Universitie, the result of whose determination is a sovereign commandment and
an authoritative and judicial decree and statute to all the whole Universitie.
2. Whereas these Godly brethren say the power of Synods in things which belong
to particular Churches is but a counsel and advise, they should have told
their mind, whether or no the Synod has more then advise and counsel in
things that are not peculiar to one Church, but common to all the Churches in
that bounds, for it would seem that a Synod is a college of commanders in
dogmaticall points, that do equally concern all Churches (this should have
beenespoken to) though in those things which are peculiar to each particular
Church, they be but a college of friendly advisers and counselors.

2. If a Synod be but a society of counselors, they have no more any
authoritative power to pronounce the sentence of non-communion, against any
single Congregation or private man, then a private man or a single Congregation
has authoritative power to pronounce that sentence against them: but 3. You
make the Synodicall power so above the power of private Christians in
counselling, as that this Synodicall power is of divine institution, as you
say, but let me ask what to do? to counsel and advise only? then that power
of counselling in Abigail to David, in one brother or sister to another brother
and sister is of divine institution, warranted by the Law of nature, Levit. 19.
18. by the Law of charity, by the communion of Saints, Col. 3. 15. 1 These. 5.
14. Heb. 3. 13. Heb. 10. 24. Mal. 3. 16. Zach. 8. 21, 22, 23. for there is a
divine institution, for one brother to counsel and teach another. But if our
brethren give a positive power to a Synod, to advise and counsel, which
private Christians have not, then this Synodicall power shall not be different
from the power of private Christians gradually only, as a lesser power to
advise differs from a greater power, but specifically and in nature. And
indeed some of our brethren teach so, though I doubt if their brethren will
return them thanks; for this way, which to me is doubtsome. For then the
members of the Synod at Jerusalem, seem to me, to be more then counselors,
and there must be a positive institution by our brethrens grounds to warrant a
power Synodicall sentially different from a Church Power, and essentially above
it: for we teach that because a congregation is a part of a classical Church,
and a classical Church a part of a provincial Church, that this power in
Congregations, Presbyteries, and Synods differ only gradually, in more or
less extention, and by the way.

Whereas some derive all Church Power from a single congregation to
presbyteries and classes, ascendendo, by ascending, Church Power in the Church
intrinsecally, and not by other ascending or descending derived to any one part
by another.
others derive it from presbyteries to a Congregation, descendendo, yea and
some from the Catholic visible Church to national assemblies, and from
national assemblies to provincial Synods, and from Synods to Presbyteries,
from Presbyteries to Congregations; I, with reverence of the learneder, do
here conceive, that there is no such cursory derivation to be dreamed of; but
because the Catholic visible Church is the great organicall body whereof
Christ Jesus God blessed for ever is head and King, and it is to^um integrale,
therefore there is no derivation either by climbing up stairs, or going down,
but Jesus Christ has communicated his power to this great political body, and
all its parts immediately; to a Congregation he has given, by an immediate flux
from himself, a political Church power intrinsecally in it, derived from none
but immediately from Jesus Christ, and the object of this power is those things
that concern a Congregation; and that same head and Lord has given immediately
an intrinsecall power to the Presbytery, in things that are purely classical,
and that without either the intervening derivation of either a Congregation
that is inferior to the Presbytery, by ascending, or without any derivative
flux of a Synodicall, national or Catholic visible Church, by descending; and
the like immediately conveyed power political comes from this glorious head
to a Synodicall, or national, or the Catholic visible Church, and the reason
is, the very nature of the visible Church which is totum integrale, a great
integrall entire body, now we know that life comes to the thighs immediately
from the soul, neither by derivation from the feet and legs, by way of
ascending, nor yet from the arms, brea^s, and shoulders, by descending. I deny
not but here there may be in other considerations, some order; as, if you ask
which is t^^ first Church; I answer with these distinctions of primatus,
firstnesse.

1. The first Church, by way of constitution, is a congregation, Constitution
and Intention.
in the family of Adam and E^^.

2. The first Church, by way of divine intention, is the Catholic Church.

Hence secondly, The first Church, by generation, or the order of generation,
and so the less perfect, is a Congregation, and here is an ascension still from
the part to the whole, from a Congregation to a Presbytery, from thence to a
provincial Church, from thence to a national, from thence to the Catholic
Church.

And the first Church by way of perfection, is that Catholic Queen Generation
and Perfection.
and Spouse which Christ is to present to the Father, without sp^^ or wrinkle,
and all parts are for this perfect whole, all the ministry, ordinances, the
dispensation of the work of redemption, Christ, his death, resurrection,
intercession, etc. are for this as the end, the perfectum totum, Ephesians. 5. 25,
26. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 13. 1 Cor. 15. 23, 24.

Hence thirdly, if we regard the order of operation; The Congregation Exercise
of power, and power it self.
is primum movens, and primum operans, for all the motions of the
Catholick-Church begins at the inferior wheels and at the lower spikes, if
a general council be to inact any thing, motions must begin at the single
Congregation at Antioch, at Jerusalem, and from thence ascend to a Preshytery,
and from thence a national Church is to send their Commissioners to act in a
Catholic council, though if we look to the power it self, it is
intrinsecally in the whole and in every part of the Catholic Church.

The fourth distinction considerable here is, that we are to regard either,

1. The order of nature, Or 1. The order of the inhesion of this power. or 2.
The order of time. Or 2. Of the real derivation of (...) power.

If we respect the order of nature, the power, by order of nature, is given by
Christ immediately, first to the whole Catholic Church, as is proved before at
length, and by this order of nat^^ ^ inhereth first in the whole Catholic
Church, as man's organized entire whole body is, by natures order, the first
adequat and principal subject of life and the reasonable soul, not this ^^
this part, but in regard of order of time, or real derivation of (...), this
whole power is immediately conferred by Jesus Christ on the whole Catholic
visible Church, and to every part of it, and any real derivation of power from
one part of the Catholic Church to another by ascension or descension is not
to be dreamed of here. As Commissioners of cities and shires have from those
cities and shires who choosed them a virtuall power Parliamentary, yet is it
not formally a power Parliamentary while the Parliament receive them as formal
members, and then, by Law of the State, there falls on them a formally
parliamentall power: so Commissioners have from their Churches which sent them,
only a virtuall or radical power, but they have never a formally Synodicall
power, by virtue of a divine institution, while they be convened in Christ's
name Syn dically. It is true, the members of a general council derive their
virtuall power to voice, and conclude from the na^^^n^ll Church that sent them
to the council, but give me leave, this is but a derived power of membership
making them fit to be incorporated in a Synod, but being once incorporated,
they have by their power of order, and by Christ's immediate institution, a
power immediately given by Christ, in whose ^ames they conveene, to voice and
conclude as a formal coun^^^, and to say, It seemed good to the holy Ghost and
to us; they cannot say, (...) good to the Churches that sent us.

The 5. distinction is, that the power is considered either ^exercised
ordinarily, or 2. occasionally. In regard of the ^^mer ordinary power is seated
collaterally in the Congregation and Presbytery, in each according to its
proportion of power, but because the power is compleater in the Presby^^, which
is a complete body, and less completely in the Congregation, which is less
complete, it is more principally seated in the Presbytery; in regard of the
latter Synods are the first subject of the occasional Church Power, in things
which ^e in common belong to many Presbyteries, or to a national- Church. But
to return, if the Synodicall power be different in essence and nature and not
gradually only, from the counsel and advise of Christians, then, first, it is
not a determination that binds, by way of counsel and brotherly advise
only, but under some higher consideration, which is as like a Church-relation
of Church Power, as any thing can be, seeing here be Pastors acting as
Pastors; 2. formally gathered in a council; 3. speaking Gods Word; 4. by the
holy Ghost. But this shall be against the Church Government of New England.
Quest. 18. page 64. 65.
2. If it be essentially different from an advise and council and warranted
by divine institution, why do not our brethen give us Scripture for it? for if
they give us Act. 15. then can they not say that the Apostles in this Synod did
determine and voice as Apostles by an Apostolic, and immediately inspiring
Spirit, for the spirit Synodicall is a spirit imitable and a rule of pertually
enduring morality in all Synods, and must lead us, for an Apostolic spirit
is not now in the world.

3. As they require a positive divine institution, for the frame of a
Presbyteriall Church in power above a Congregation, and will not be satisfied
with the light of nature, which upon the supposall of a spiritual government
instituted by Christ in a Congregation which is a part, may clearly, by the
hand, lead us to the enlarging of that same spiritual government in the whole,
that is, to a number of consociated Churches which are all interessed, as one
common society in a common government, so they must make out, for their Synod
endued with dogmaticall power a positive divine institution.

4. We desire a warrant from the Word why a college of Pastors determining by
the Word of God as Pastors having power of order and acting in a college
according to that power, should not be a formal and ordinary great Presbytery.

5. How can they, by our brethrens determination, exercise such pastoral acts
out of their own Congregations toward those Churches to which they have no
pastoral relation, virtute potestatis ordinis?

6. How can the wisdom of Christ, (who provideth that his servants be not
despised, but that despisers in a Church way should be censured, 1 Timothy 1. 19,
20.) cloth his messengers in a Synod with a power dogmaticall and deny all
power of i^^^diction to them, upon the supposall that their determinations be
rejected? I fear there be something under this, that none are to be censured
or delivered to Satan for heterodox opinions, except they err in points
fundamental.

But farther it may be made good that a power dogmaticall is not different in
nature from a power of jurisdiction, for we read not of any society that has
power to meet to make Laws and decrees, which have not power also to back
their decrees with punishments: if the Jewish Synedry might meet to declare
judicially what was Gods Law, in point of conscience, and what not, and to tie
men to it, they had power to conveene and make Laws, far more may they
punish contraveners of the Law, for a nomothetick power in a society which is
the greater power and is in the fountain, must presuppose in the society the
less power, which is to punish, and the power of punishing is in the inferior
judicature, so a nomothetick power ministerial cannot want a power of
censuring. It is true, a single Pastor may ministerially give out commandments
in the authority of Christ, but he cannot his alone censure or excommunicate
the contraveners of those commandments, but it follows well in an assembly
he has power to censure and excommunicate, now here Pastors and Elders are in
an assembly.

It is objected; Pastors in a Synod have no jurisdiction as Pasters; for what
they do as Pastors that they may do there alone, and on; of a Synod: but they
do not, nor cannot determine and give out Canons there alone, and they cannot
there alone determine juridically; therefore they do not wholly and poorly as
Pastors in relation to those Churches, give out these decrees, yet do they not
give out the decrees as privite men wholly, but in some pastor all relation,
for Pastors as Pastors have something peculiar to them in all Churches whither
they come to preach so as a special blessing follows on their labors,
though they be not Pastors in relation to all the Churches they come to, even
as a Sermon on the Lords day is instamped with a more special blessing b^^^use
of Gods institution imprinted on the day, then a Sermon preached in another day.

Answ. This argument is much for us, it is proper to acts of jurisdiction
ecclesiastical that they cannot be exercised by one only, but must be
exercised by a society, now a Pastor as a Pastor his alone without any
collaterally joined with him exercises his pastoral acts of preaching and of
administrating the Sacraments, but those who give out those decrees, cannot
give them out Synodically, but in a Synod and Court-wayes as forensicall
decrees, and so in a juridicall way, and because Pastors, whither so ever they
come, do remain Pastors. 1. The Apostles are not in this Synod as Apostles,
Secondly, nor yet as gifted Christians to give their counsel and advise; nor,
thirdly (as this answerer grants) merely as Pastors, then it must follow
that, fourthly, they are here as such pastors conveened Synodically, by divine
institution, and that this is the pattern of a Synod.

Object. 2. But there is no censuring of persons for scandalls in this meeting,
because there is nothing here but a doctrinall declaration of the falsehood of
their opinion who taught a necessity of circumcision; and that all is done by
way of doctrine and by power of the Keys of knowledge, not of jurisdiction, is
clear from the end of this meeting, Act. 5. 2. Paul and Barnabas were sent
from the Church of Antioc^ unto Jerusalem unto the Apostles and Elders, (...),
concerning this question, and v. 6. the Apostles and Elders came together to
consider, (...), of this matter, consideration of Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson
against Mr. Herle, c. 1. p. 8.
questions being the end of the Synod is a thing belonging to doctrinal power
merely, so Mr. Mather.
Answ. 1. It is false that there is no censuring of persons here, for to say
nothing that Peter accuses those of the wrong side as personally present at
the Synod, either being summoned or coming thither by appeal, v. 10. Now
therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the Discip'es, etc.
which reproof coming from one man only, cannot be called a Synodicall
reproof; It is more then evident that the public Synodicall censure of rebuke
is put upon those who held and urged the necessity of circumcision, and why
not excommunication also in case of obstinacy? for the Synodicall censure of a
public Synodicall rebuke is only gradually different, not specifically from
excommunication and both must proceed from one and the same power? Now the
Synodicall censure is evident in the Text, v. 24. certain went out from us,
(so it is clear they pretended they were in this point followers of the
Apostles) and Lorinus thinks that some deemed them schismatics.

2. They have troubled you with words; Lorinus cites the Sy(...) (...)
vedalacachum, they have terrified you, as if your salvation were not sure,
except you keep Moses his Law of ceremonies and the moral Law. 3. (...),
destraying by false arguments your souls, it is a word contrary to building up
in sound knowledge (as Aristotle takes Aristot. 5. (...). text 31.
the word) saying that you must be circumcised and keep the Law. 4. They
abused the name of the Apostles as having an Apostolic commandment, and so a
divine warrant for their false doctrine, and therefore are they refuted as
liars, (...), whence it is clear they did labor to prove a necessity of
circumcision not only from the old Testament and an express divine Law, but
also from the authority of the Apostles, which was manifestly false; out of
which I argue thus. If the Apostles do not only in a doctrinall way refute a
false doctrine in this Synod, but also in a Church Way, and by a juridicall
power rebuke and Synodically charge the authors, as sub^erters of souls, and
liars, then they do not only use a mere doctrinall power in this Synod, but
also a juridicall power: but the former is true: Ergo, so is the latter. 2.
Observe two things in these obtruders of circumcision. First, the error of
their judgment. It is more then apparent, that they had a heterodox and
erroneous opinion of God and his worship, and the way of salvation, as is
clear, Act. 15. 1. And certain men which came down from Judea, taught the
brethren, (and said) except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye
cannot be saved. This doctrine is clearly refuted both by Peter v. 10. That
yoke of the Law we disclaim, there is a way of salvation without that yoke,
v. 11. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we shall be
saved as they, and it is synodically refuted, v. 24. we gave no such
commandment, it is not the mind of us the Apostles of the Lord that you keep
Moses Law, as you hope to be saved; there was for this error in their
judgment required a doctrinall or dogmaticall power, and this the Synod used.
2. Besides this erroneous opinion in their judgment, there was another fault
and scandal that the Synod was to censure, to wit, their obtruding of their
false way upon the souls and consciences of the Churches, as verse. 1 They
taught the brethren this false doctrine. 2. That they wilfully and obstinately
did hold this opinion, and raised a Schism in the Courch, v. 2. wherefore Paul
and Barnabas had no small (...), dissension, (the word signifies sedition
which was raised by those who held that erroneous opinion) and great
disputation with them. 3. They laid a yoke upon the brethren, v. 10. and v. 7.
They made great disputation against the Apostles, and v. 24. They troubled the
brethren and perverted their souls. This was not simply an heterodox opinion
which is the material part of a heresy, but had something of the formal part
of an heresy, to wit, some degrees of pertinacie, of brutish and blind zeal,
even to the troubling and perverting of the souls of the Churches, while as
they would make disciples to themselves, and lead away souls from the
simplicity of the Gospel; now the Synod does not help this latter simply, in
a Synodicall way, by a dogmaticall and doctrinall power, but by an authority
Synodicall, and therefore they authoritatively rebuke them, as subverters of
souls; and whereas these teachers laid on an unjust yoke to keep Moses his
Law upon the Churches, v. 10. the Synod by their ecclesiastical and juridicall
authority does free the Churches of that yoke, and they say in their decree.
v. 28. It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us, (not to lay the yoke of
Moses his Law on you, as those who trouble you have done) to lay upon you no
greater burden, then these necessary things, etc. now if there had been
nothing to do but to resolve the question, if this had been the total and
adequat end of the Synod, in a mere doctrinall way to resolve the question,
Whether must we be circumcised, and keep the Law moral and ceremonial of
Moses, upon necessity of salvation, as the argument of our brethren
contendeth; Peter, v. 10. 11. made a clear issue of the question, We are saved
by the grace of God, both ^^nes and Gentiles, and it is to tempt God to lay the
yoke of the Law of Moses upon the brethren; the resolving of that question is
the end of the Synod, but not the adequat end, for here that, not only the
doctrinall power was to be used, but beside that, 1. the schism was to be
removed, and the authority of the Synod to be used against the wilfulness
and obstinacy of those obtruders of circumcision, in rebuking them as
perverters of souls. 2. For the scandal which might have been taken if the
Gentiles should have eaten blood and things strangled, and meats offered to
idols, and therefore the Apostles and Elders behoved, as a conveened Synod to
forbid a grievous scandal and a spiritual homicide against the Law of nature,
to wit, that the Gentiles for fear of scandalizing weak. believers amongst
the Jews, should abstain from the practice of some things at this time
merely indifferent in their nature, though not indifferent in their use, such
as were to eat things offered to idols, things strangled and blood: and
whereas our brethren, 3. Object, If the Apostles did any thing more then might
have been done by private Pastors out of a Synod, it was merely Apostolical,
and the Elders did but assent to the Apostles Apostolical determination; and
every one did here, Apostles, Elders, and Brethren, more suo, Apostles as
Apostles, Elders and Brethren as Elders and Brethren, after their manner as
consenters to the Apostles, but other ways it is a begging of the question,
for to say the Apostles and Elders, rebuked Synodically the obtruders of
circumcision, its but said, because one Pastor might have rebuked those
obtruders; for the specification of actions must not be taken from their
efficient causes, but from their formal objects, therefore this is no good
consequence, the Synod rebuked those obtruders, Ergo, the Synod rebuked them as
a Synod, and by a power of jurisdiction, it follows not, for Paul, Gal. 2.
rebuked Peter; Ergo, Paul had a power of jurisdiction over Peter. I think your
selves will deny this consequence.

I Answer, 1. These two answers are contradictory, and shows that our
brethren are not true to their own principles, for sometime they say the
Apostles gave out this decree as Apostles, and sometime there is nothing here
done by a mere doctrinall power, such as Paul had over Peter, or one single
Pastor has over another, now it is sure that Paul had no Apostolic, power
over Peter, and that one Pastor have not Apostolic power over another. 2. When
our brethren say here that the Apostles as Apostles by an infallible spirit
gave out this Decree, they do in this help the Papists, as Bellarmine,
Becanus, Gr^^rut, and in particular the Jesuit Lorinus com. in loc.
Lorinus, who says, decr^um authenticum cujus inspirator spiritus sanct^, and
so says Cornelius a Lap. in loc.
Cornelius a lapide, visi^m est nob is inspiratis and decretis a Spiritu
sanctus, therefore says he the council cannot err, and so Salmeron in loc.
Salmeron and Cajetan in loc.
Cajetan say, and expressly Stapleton in Antidot. Apost. inc. 15. v. 28. actor.
Apost.
Stapleton says this Apostosack definition flowed from the instinct of the
holy Ghost; observandum (says Stapleton) quanta habenda sit ecclesiae
definienth authorit^s; hence our brether here must yield either that all Synods
are infallible, as Papists say, this Synod the pattern of all Synods being
concluded by an Apostolic spirit could not err, and so neither can counsels
err, or they must with Socinians and Arminians say there is no warrant for
Synods here at all. And certainly though we judge our brethren as far from
Popery and Socinianisme, as they think we detest Antichristian Presbytery,
yet if this Synod be concluded by an Apostolic spirit, it is no warrant to
be imitated by the Churches, and we have no ground hence, for lawful Synods.
Whittakerus, Calvin, Beza, Luther, and all our Divines do all allege this
place as a pregnant ground not of Apostolic, but of ordinary and constant
Synods to the end of the world; and Diodatus in in ann. on the place. ac. 15.
28.
Diodatus, good to the holy Ghost) because they did treat of ecclesiastical
reders concerning the quietness and order of the Church, wherein ecclesiastical
authority has place, the Assembly used this term, it seemed good to us,
which is not used, neither in articles of faith, nor in the commandments which
merely concerned the conscience: and to show that authority was with holy
reason and wisdom, there is added, and to the holy Ghost, who guided the
Apostles in these outward things also, 1. Cer. 7. 25. 40.

2. If our brethren mean that the Elders and brethren were in this Apostolic
and immediately inspired Synodicall determination, not as collateral penners of
Scriptures joined with the Apostles, but only as consenters and as consenters
by power of an ordinary holy Ghost working consent in them, more suo, according
to their capacity as ordinary Elders. 1. They yet more help the Papists
because they must say only Apostles, and so only their successors; the
Prelates had definitive voices in this Synod, the Presbyters and Brethren did
no more then Papists and Prelates say Presbyters did in general counsels of
old, and therefore the Presbyter is to subscribe, Ego, A. N. Presbyter
consentiens subseribo, whereas the Prelate subscribed (say they) Ego, A. B.
Episcopus definiens subscribo; we crave a warrant in Gods Word to make an
Apostle or a Prelate a Synodicall definer, having a definitive voice, and the
Elder Brother, or Presbyter to have a consultative voice, for here all the
multitude (if there was a multitude present) do make Synodicall decrees by
consulting and consenting, yea all the nation may come to a national Synod,
and both reason, dispute, and consent, because matters of doctrine and
government of the Church concerns all, therefore all have an interest of
presence, and all have an interest of reasoning; and 3. by consequent all have
an interest of consenting; yea of protesting on the contrary, if the Synod
determine any thing against the Word of God. If they say there is a threeford
consent in this Synod, 1. an Apostolical, 2. a second Synodicall agreeing to
Elders as Elders, and a third, that of the people, or a popular; What a mixed
Synod shall this be? but 1. then as the Epistle to the Tlxssalonians is called
the Epistle of Paul, not the Epistle of Silvanus and Timotheus, though Silvanus
and Timotheus did consent, so these (dogmata) or decrees should not be called
the decrees of the Apostles and Elders, as they are called, Act. 16. 4. Act.
15. 6. Act. 21. 25. but only the decrees of the Apostles; seeing the Elders
did only consent, and had no definitive influence in making the decree, by
this doctrine, as Silvanus and Timotheus were not joint penmen of Scripture
with Paul.

3. When as it is said the specification of actions must not be taken from the
efficient cause, but from the formal object, and all that a done in this Synod
might have been done by a single Pastor.
I answer, we do not fetch the specification of this rebuke and of these
decrees from the efficient causes, but from the formal object, for an Apostle
might his alone have rebuked these obtruders of circumcision, and made this
decree materialiter, for Paul did, more his alone then this, when he wrote the
E^istle to the Romans, but yet one Pastor could not have Synodically rebuked,
and given out a decree formally Synodicall, laying an Ecclesiastical tie on
more Churches then one, there is great ods to do one and the same action
formally, and to do the same action materially, and I believe though actions
have not, by good logic, their total specification from their efficient
cause, yet that ordinances of God as lawful have their specification from the
efficient causes in part our brethren cannot deny. For what made the difference
betwixt Aaron his fire offered to the Lord, and Nadab and Abihu their strange
and unlawful fire, that they offered to the Lord, but that the on fire had God
for its author, the other had men, and the like I say of Gods feasts, and the
feasts devised by Jeroboam, else if a woman preach and administrate the Lords
Supper in the Church, that preaching and sacrament administrated by her should
not have a different specification and essence, if we speak morally or
Theologically, from that same very preaching and celebration of the Supper
performed in the Church by a lawful Pastor; it is (as I conceive) of the
essence of an action Synodicall (I say not its total essence) that it cannot
be performed by one in a Church Way, and with an ecclesiastical tie, but it
must be performed by many, else it is not a Synodicall action, and it is true
that Paul, Romans 14. and 1 Cor. 8. 10. has in substance the same Canon
forbidding scandal, which is forbidden in this Canon prohibiting eating of
meats offered to Idols, and blood, in the case of scandal; but (I pray you)
is there not difference betwixt the one prohibition and the other? yea there
is, for, Romans 14. 1 Cor. 8. 10. it has undenyably Apostolic authority, here
it has only Synodicall. 2. There it is a commandment of God, here it is a
Canon of the Church. 3. There it comes from one man, here from a college of
Apostles and Elders conveened, and yet materially it is the same prohibition.

Object. 4. The Acts of this Synod are finaliter acts of government, because
they are rules conducing for the governing of the Church, but formaliter, they
are acts of dogmaticall power, and not formally acts of jurisdiction, for there
is no rebuking of subverters of souls inordine to excommunication, no penal
power is exercised here, sub poona, under the pain of excommunication, and
therefore there an here no formal acts of government.
Answ. 1. The acts of Church Government finaliter, that is, government, because
to prescribe rules and directive Laws (for they are not properly Laws which
the Church prescribes, Christ is the only Lawgiver) are formal acts of
governing, and one power does not make Laws for governing the Church, and
another power different in nature punish the contraveners. And what power
disposes and orders, the means do also dispose and order the end; Canons
of the Church tending to the edification of the Church are means tending to
the government of the Church, and I appeal to the judgment of our reverend
brethren, if we suppose that one single Congregation should do all that this
Synod does, if they would not call it a formal governing of that particular
Congregation: for example, in the Church of Pergamus, one arises and teaches
the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, suppose that fornication is indifferent is the
eating of blood, and is no sin; the Angels of the Church of Pergamus preach
against this doctrine, in private, they deal by force of arguments from
Scripture, that it is a wicked doctrine, and destructive to holiness, as Paul
and Barnab as disputes, Act. 15. 1. 2. with the obtruders of a necessity of
Circumcision, yet they prevail not, now suppose this independent Church
following the Apostle Paul's way, think good to convene a Synod or a
parishionall assembly to determine Synodically that this is a wicked doctrine,
and shall in their decree call the holders of this doctrine subverters of
souls, and forbid fornication in their Synod, now supposing Pergamus to be a
single Church in a remote Island consociated with no neighboring Churches, who
could in reason deny that this Synodicall power so inacting were a power
formally governing the Church of. Pergamus? it is true, some of our brethren
say, that it is even to us a received tenent that the power that disposes of
the means of governing does not for that govern in respect that we teach that
the classical presbytery does decree and in act, and the Congregation does
execute these Decreed, but I pray you does this prove that the power ordering
the means of governing is no formal act of governing? yea the contrary is
true, because the Congregation executing the acts of the classical presbytery,
as subordinat in that act to the classical presbytery, and by their authority,
therefore while they give out these acts or Canons, do formally govern, that
Congregation executing their acts, in this particular.

Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson against Mr. Herle, c. 1. p. 9. teach that there is
a power of clearing truth dogmatically, and that (...)(...), ultimately, where
the controversy is ended, but they will have this ultimate power not in a
Synod only, but also in a Congregation. But 1. they seem to make this
dogmaticall power a Church Power, and the exercise thereof formally an act of
Church Government, and so it must be Church Power and Church Government in the
Synod, as well as in the Congregation. 2. The last period and conclusion of the
controversy cannot be both in the Congregation, de jure, by right only, and
in the Synod by right only, for two last powers cannot be properly in two
subordinate judicatures, for if Antioch appeal to a Synod, as they doc, Act.
15. 2. then Antioch is not the sole, last and ultimate and final judge; and 3.
If the controversy concern many Churches, as this does, Act. 15. 2. 23. 24. I
see not how a Congregation, except they transgress their line, can finally
determine it.

And here while as our brethren do all edge that a Synod has a power to
decree, and make laws, but has no power at all to execute these Laws or to
punish the contraveners, but power of punishing is all in the single
Congregation. ^. They tie all governing power to a punishing power, as if there
were no other ways to govern, but upon supposall of scandalls, whereas all
Scripture and polliticians make a power of giving Laws formally a governing
power. 2. When one society and Synod makes the Laws, and another must
execute them and punish the contraveners, the single Congregation that
punishes, is more subjected by a truly prelaticall bondage, then if the
Lawmakers had only the power of punishing the contraveners, at they only
have the power of making the Laws. I take not here Laws for Laws properly so
called, but for ministerial directories having ecclesiastical authority: and
here in effect, our brethren lay truly a prelaticall bondage on the Churches
of Christ, for they teach that a Synod may make a Law by a pastoral power, and
that this Synod is an ordinance of Christ by Act. 15. and that as Prelates did,
they send those Synodic^ll decrees to be obeyed and put in execution by the
Churches, and ordain the contraveners to be punished by the Churches, and
here is a power above a power, and mandates for government sent by the Synod to
the Churches to be obeyed, and a Synod governing by Churches, this they call
prelaticall in us.

But 3. there is no penal power here (say they) and nothing decerved to be
obeyed, sub paena, under the pain of excommunication, therefore no power of
jurisdiction. But this consequence is justly denied, for no politician, no
reason in the world can say that all power of jurisdiction is included in the
power of excommunication. What? has the Church a Church Power to threaten, and
no Church Power to pardon the penltent? I think if the Church as the Church,
Matthew. 18. receive a power from Christ to bind in heaven and earth, does not
Christ in that same patent give to her also a power to loose in earth and
heaven? and when he says, if be refuse to bear the Church, let him be to
thee ^ aube^hen and publican; does he not give to the Church a power to
command? if he command to hear and obey the Church, he must give a power of
jurisdiction to the Church to command, and a power to command not penal only,
but promissorie also, to loose and absolve upon condition of prosessed
repentance. Now suppose the Church make a Law, that theresurrection of the dead
is a truth of God to be believed, and professed, upon occasion that in the
Congregation Hymeneus and Alexander den yeth that Article, in that very
Commandment doctrinall the Church does govern the whole Congregation, and
exercises a power of formal governing, though in their act they say nothing
of the censure of excommunication, to those who shall deny that Article of the
resurrection, for (I hope) a simple sanction makes a Law, though no penalty
be expressed in it, and though there had been in the Decree, Act 15. 28. an
express punishment, this should, to our brethren prove no power of
jurisdiction exercised by many, for this which is said, Gal. 1. 8. Though we
or an Angel from heaven preach unto you (another Gospel) then that which we
have preached let him be accursed, and that 1 Cor. 9. 16. Woe unto me if I
preach not the Gospel, and many other threatenings in Scripture, though a
punishment be annexed expressly, cease not to be merely doctrinall, and are
not threatenings importing formally any power of Church-jurisdiction, and
therefore though mention should have been made of a censure, if there be not
here a Synod. 2. Having power and authority from Christ. 3. Commanding by the
holy Ghost, (as these indeed are all here) the name of censure should prove no
power of jurisdiction.

Object. 5. The laying on of the yoke spoken of, v. 28. is a meer^, doctrinall
yoke, and it imports no more a poner of jurisdiction, then we can conclude
that the obtruders of circumcision bad a power of jurisdiction, because they
are said to lay on a yoke also, and to tempt God in so doing, verse. 10.
Answ. I retort this reason, for we can then no more conclude that the Apostles
by an Apostolic authority laid on this yoke, then we can conclude that the
obtruders of circumcision did lay on this yoke, because they are said to lay
on a yoke and to tempt God, v. 10. It is a most unequal reasoning to argue
against a just Synodicall power from a sinful and unjust power, for these
obtruders of circumcision had no lawful power at all to lay a yoke on the
Disciples, but sinned and tempted God in laying on that yoke, but it is not
denied by our brethren, but the Apostles and Elders had a lawful power to lay
on a yoke in this Synod, only it is controverted whether it be a mere
dogmaticall or doctrinall power, or if it be a power of jurisdiction, nay the
obtruders of circumcision by neither of these two powers laid on a yoke upon
the Dsciples.

Object. 6. These decrees which did no other ways bind the Church of
Jerusalem, then they did bind all the Churches of the world, cannot be decrees
of power of jurisdiction over the Church of Jerusalem, and over the Church of
Antioch. But these decrees did no otherwise bind the Church of Jerusalem, then
they did bind all the Churches of the world, for the decrees of Apostles and
Elders at Jerusalem, Act. 6. 4, 5. were sent to all the Churches of the world
to be observed, and seeing they could not as Synodicall Canons obliege all the
Churches of the world, by an ecclesiastical tie, because all the Churches of
the world sent not Commissioners, and all the Churches of the world couldnot be
represented in this Synod, but only the Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch; yea
we see not that this Synod is any more then the Church of Antioch seeking
counsel from the sister Church at Jerusalem; as one Church may advise another
Church that is weaker in knowledge, in a matter of such difficulty, because
the Apostles were at Jerusalem, and that (...). 1. The whole Canons are
ascribed to the Church of Jerusalem only, to the Apostles, Elders and the
whole Church, Act. 15. 22. and Act. 15. 22. and Act. 16. 4, 5. and Act. 21. 25.
the Elders of Jerusalem take this act or canon to themselves. 2. It cannot be
proven that the Churches of Syria and Cilicia had any commissioners he^^, far
less had all the Churches of the Gentiles, who yet are commanded to keep
those decrees by commissioners there, C. 15. 19. Act. 21. 25. Act. 16. 4, 5. 3.
It cannot be proven that Antioch sent Elders to this meeting, but only
Commissioners, Act. 15. 2.

Answ. This answer is much contradicent to what our brethren other ways hold,
for if it be a pattern of a sister Church, giving advise and counsel to
another, this is imitable to the worlds end, and if the Canon come from the
Apostles as Apostles it is not imitable.

2. That one sister Church can lay burdens on another, and give out (...),
decrees to be kept is unwarrantable; now (...) as they are called by all that
understands Greek, are not friendly advises of brethren; the Seventie
Interpreters use the word, Daniel 6. 26. to express a Law made by Darius, Luke
uses the word, c. 2. 1. says a decree (...) came from Augustus Caesar to tax
all the World. 2. It is a graver business then we can think of, to believe
that these who only give advise and counsel, and must conveene in a Synod, as
Apostles and Elders do here, v. 23. (2) that they can say as it is v. 28. It
seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us to lay no other burden on you then
t^^se necessary things, for a counsel or advise can never amount to the burden
imposed by the holy Ghost speaking in a Synod: 2. It is denied that this decree
obliged the Church of Jerusalem no other way then it obliged all the Churches
of all the world, for here be three sorts of Churches, and three sorts of
Churches are under a tie by this Synod; first, Jerusalem, secondly, Antioch,
Syria and Cilicia, thirdly, universally all the Churches of the Gentiles. The
Church of Jerusalem have formal commissioners, here under an ecclesiastical
tie as concerning the faith of the things contained in the decree, that it is
lawful for the Gentiles to abstain from things offered to idols, from things
strangled, and from blood; and they were simply under a tie both of the seventh
Commandment, and by the fifth Commandment, to abstain from fornication,
because the Synod had forbidden it. 2. They were under a tie by due proportion,
not to keep the Law of Moses and not to be circumcised by any necessity of a
Divine Law, but only by permission to use these ceremonies for fear of
scandal. 3. They are tied by proportion also to give no offense in things
indifferent. 4. Not to reject the Gentiles whom the Lord had called to his
heavenly kingdom, as well as the Jews. 2. These Churches of the Gentiles who
never heard of the Synod, and so were not obliged to be there in their
Commissioners or not tied at all by this Decree, by virtue of any
ecclesiastical tie, but are only tied by the Law of Nature, not to abuse
their liberty in the use of things in their own nature indifferent, and so
this is false that the Church of Jerusalem was tied no other way by these acts
then all Churches of the world, for some of the Churches of the world were not
tied at all, by any ecclesiastical bond, but only for the necessity of the
Law of Nature. 3. Jerusalem, Antioch, Syria and Cilicia were tied by an
ecclesiastical tie, because Jerusalem and the Churches of Antioch had here
Commissioners, for Antioch sent Paul and Barnabas with certain other of them,
(...), this must relate to Pastors and Elders, if Syria and Cilicia had no
Commissioners here, as certainly they were obliged to send Commissioners, as
well as Antioch, seeing their case was one with Antioch, v. 23. and they could
not but hear of this Apostolic remedy to remove the scandal of false
Doctrine, and therefore their Commissioners were either here, or then they were
obliged to be here, and here we have the true essence of a Synod, to wit, a
meeting of the Churches of Antioch and Jerusalem at Jerusalem to determine of
this question. But that the Church of Jerusalem did not determine all the
business in a Presbyteriall way, and that others had hand in it, is clear. 1.
Because Paul and Barnabas and others with them are expressly sent from Antioch
to Jerusalem as Commissioners and Elders, and here they reason and voice, as is
clear, chapter 15. v. 12. v. 22. v. 28. chapter 16. 4. chapter 21. 25, 26. and the Acts
and Decrees are ascribed to all the Apostles and Elders who were present at the
council, chapter 14. 4. chapter 15. v. 22. v. 12. and amongst these were Paul and
Barnabas, with certain others sent from Anti^b, Act. 15. 2. and the Elders of
Jerusalem, Act. 21. 25. with the Apostles, Act. 16. 4. (2.) the reasons
alleged are false, for Act. 16. 4. Act. 15. 22. Act. 21. 25. the Acts and
Synodicall Decrees are not ascribed to Elders of Jerusalem only, but to the
Apostles who were not Elders at Jerusalem, and to the Elders in Jerusalem, Act.
16. 4. not of Jerusalem. 3. It is no matter though it cannot be proven that
the Churches of Syria and Cilicis had no Commissioners there, for first, the
contrary cannot be proven; secondly, they ought to have had Commissioners
here; thirdly, the Acts are sent to them conjunctly with Antioch, and
messengers to report the mind and sense of the Assembly as to Antioch, v. 23.
(4.) It is but a groundless conceit to say that Paul and Barnabas came to the
Synod as Commissio^^^s, or as servants to receive information, not as Elders to
give their decisive voices, because Paul carried himself in the assembly as
Peter and James who were Elders in the assembly, and they being Apostles, the
decrees are ascribed to the Apostles without any distinction, Act. 15. 28. Act.
16. 4. And if Paul and Barnabas, and Silas a Prophet of the Church at Antioch,
Act. 15. v. 32. with Judas, v. 27. also a Prophet, had been only
Commissioners and servants of the Church at Antioch, and not Elders and members
of the Assembly, how could they have voices in the Church or Congregation of
Jerusalem? for the messengers of one Congregation has not place to voice in
another Congregation. 2. It is said expressly, It seemed good to the Apostles
and Elders, with the whole Church to send chosen men of their own, with Paul
and Barnabas, namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men, (leading
men) amongst the Brethren; now I desire to be resolved in two; 1. how Judas
and Silas were men of their own company (...), certainly (...) must relate to
the Assembly, to wit, to Elders and Apostles, by all good Grammar, and how are
they called (...), Captains and leading men amongst the Brethren, which
brethren are certainly these mentioned in the same verse, Apostles, Elders, and
the whole Church, and these mentioned in the next verse, 23. Apostles, Elders
and Brethren, that is, chosen men of this Assembly; now it is evident that
Judas and Silas were no part of Elders of the Church of Jerusalem, but Prophets
at Antiab, v. 32. and members of that Presbytery spoken of Act. 13. 1, 2. and
Act. 15. v. 35. And what power then had the Assembly to send them, and
especially what power had the Eldership or presbytery of Jerusalem to send men
(...), of their own company who were not men of their own company? therefore
they were called chosen men (...) of their own company, and leading men (...)
of the Brethren, because they were members of the Assembly, and of that
council gathered together with one accord, v. 25. and not because they were
naked messengers of the Church of Antioch, but Elders, Prophets, v. 32. and
members of the Assembly, v. 22. 23. And when as it is said Act. 16. 4. Act. 21.
28. These decrees are ascribed to the Elders in Jerusalem. I answer they are
not called the Elders of the Church of Jerusalem, as Revel. 2. 1. To the Angel
of the Church of Ephesus, v. 8. To the Angel of the Church of Smyrna, and v.
12. of the Church of Pergamus, and v. 18. and Act. 20. 17. but the Eders which
were at Jerusalem assembled: and this does no more prove that all these Elders
were only the Elders of the Church at Jerusalem, then it proves that the
Apostles were the Apostles of the Church at Jerusalem which no man can say: yea
by the phrase of Scripture used in other places, it is clear they were not the
Elders of the Church of Jerusalem; and for Act. 21. 25. The Elders of the
Church of Jerusalem takes those Decrees upon them, not as if they made the
whole Synod, but because they were a considerable part of the Synod, for it is
clear from the story, Act. 15. that the Apostles and others were members of
that assembly, and therefore, that v. 25. We have written and concluded, etc.
must be expounded, we as a part of the Synod, have written, etc. and it is a
Synecdoche, and the pronoune (...) (we) includes no Apostle but James,
whereas Peter, Paul, Barnabas, Judas, Sil^s and others Elders and Brethren were
members of the Synod, yea and (as our Brethren say, though to me it is not
probable) the whole Church of Jerusalem from v. 22. c. 15.

Object. 7. They take away the scandal in a doctrinall way only, declaring
that they ought to abstain from things scandalous.
Answ. The very delivering to Satan may thus be called doctrinall, because it
is a Declaration that the man's sins are retained in heaven, yet it is an
authoritative declaration, and if it be mere doctrinall, one Pastor and one
Prophet might have done all which this venerable college of Apostles and
Elders disputed, reasoned, and concluded Synodically. A mere doctrinall power
lays not on burdens and Decrees. Herodian calls such (...)
senatusconsult^in, and Bude^^s a man excellently skillful in the Greek
language says the like Budens co^me^t. l^ng. (...).

C. l. n^m and demostbenes ss. delegis.


of it, and so does the civil Law make it a statute of the Senate.

Object. 8. The reason why Patel could not, though he was an Apostle,
determine this at Antioch, was not because he wanted Apostolic authority,
but because his Apostolic power was more questionable, he not having seen
Christ in the flesh, nor being a witness of the life, death and resurrection
of Christ, then the authority of James and Peter who were eyewitnesses of
Christ's life, doctrine, and sufferings, and saw him visibly ascend to heaven,
and the believers doubted if he was an Apostle, and the Synod was convened to
have theresolution of the Apostles, and so it was merely Apostolical.
Ans. Though I grant there beesome truth in this, that Paul's Apostolic calling
was now more question (...), then the rest of the Apostles; and I easily yield
that these who disputed with him could not rest upon his authority; yet I deny
that hence we can infer no Synod: for if the Apostles had convened in Synod
to satisfy those who doubted of Paul's authority as an Apostle; then they
would have reterred the matter to James and Peter, who to these believers were
undoubtedly the Apostles of the Lord: but if the Apostles had had no intent,
but to end the controversy in a mere Apostolic way, and not intended a
Synodicall and an ^clesiasticall and perpetual remedy in such cases of
controversies, in particular Churches; I shall not believe that the Apostles
when they were to determine by a superior, an Apostolic and infallible light,
they would have joined with them the Elders, as Act. 15. 16. to consider of the
question, and that the Church of Au^ioch doubting if Paul was an Apostle, would
have decreed to seek a resolution from Elders, and that in an Apostolic way,
for they sent to the Elders at Jerusalem for a resolution as well as to the
Apostles, Act. 15. 2. and judge ye if the Apostles being to determine
infallibly as Apostles, would join the falliblo and inferior light of Elders,
v. 6. and Brethren, v. 22. if tlloy had not had a mind to determine the
question in a Synodicall way.

Object. 9. But it is not clear that in this act they either censure persons,
or do any thing in order to Church-censure, but only exercise a naked
doctrinall power.
Answ. A doctrinall power was in a higher measure in the Apostles, then in all
the Elders of the world, who were all but fallible men, and James and Peter to
these believers, who moved the question, were undenyably Apostles, and what
doctrinall power could they seek in the Elders to whose determination, by
intention both of Antioch, chapter 15. 2. and by the Apostles intention, v. 6. the
question is referred as well as to the Apostles? if the matter was not to be
ended by a formal Synod. 2. Nor can they deny a power of jurisdiction though
there were no persons rebuked and censured in this Synod; for the object of a
juridicall power is not only persons, but things of order, decency,
circumstances, questions of doctrine, as is clear, Re^el. 1. 14. 15. and
officers to be ordained, Act. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 Timothy 5. 22. 2 Timothy 2. 2, 3. (3.)
Our brethren cannot deny but the sentence of non-Communion is a censure, and a
great one, yea and of kindred and blood most near to excommunication, and that
if any Churches should have ref^^sed those Canons, by this Canon the Churches
might have pronounced the sentence of non-communion against them, and to
pronounce this sentence is an act of government as properly so called, as to
pronounce the sentence of excommunication, for it is the formal half of the
sentence of excommunication.

Object. 10. It seems that Apostles here determine as Apostles, for they
condenme the obtruders of circumcision, because they taught these things
without any Apostolic, Commandment, v. 24. They teach that you must be
circumcised and keep the Law, to whom, we, (the Apostles) gave no such
commandment.
Answ. This is no more a good argument to prove that the obtruders of
circumcision did teach false doctrine, and were not condemned by the Apostles
and Elders Synodically, then if one should say, this is not a Synodicall decree
of the Church, because it is proven and made good by the Word of God, for
Synodicall decrees exclude not Gods word, though they be not formally
Scripture; for in some part of the Epistle the Apostles may well speak of
themselves as distinguished from Elders and as Apostles, and yet the assembly
is an ordinary Synod and not an Apostolic meeting, for if we should argue
thus, the whole Church, men and women, v. 22. sent messengers to Antioch, as
the Church, and not as Apostles, our brethren would think it a weak
consequence to infer, Ergo, this was nothing but a Congregational, not an
Apostolical meeting. Yet our brethren contend that the whole Church and single
Congregation of Jerusalem did concur in this meeting as consenters, and
having power also, though not of jurisdiction; but I wonder why our brethren
should so contend that there was no power of censuring put forth in this
Assembly, seeing one of their special answers, whereby they would prove that
this it not a pattern of an ordinary Synod, and such a Synod as we contend
for, having power of jurisdiction is, that this was an ordinary meeting of the
Elders and Church of Jerusalem, giving counsel and advise with the Apostles to
the Church of Antioch, but I am sure the business of not scandalizing did as
much concern the Church of Jerusalem, and therefore in the Synod they ought to
put forth power of jurisdiction, if any of their members, hearing that the
Apostles contended that the ceremonial Law did not lay a tie on the conscience
of either Jew or Gentile, in foro dei, before Gods court, as the places cited
by James prove, v. 15, 16, 17. (and Peter says expressly that God now puts
no difference betwixt Jews and Gentiles, v. 9. but (...) are saved through the
grace of our Lord Jesus, v. 11.) should ab ^aine from blood, to the offense of
the weaker, should not this Congregation all Church condemn such, in ordine ad
censuram, in order to excommunication? yea the Eldership and Congregation of
Jerusalem here convened as our brethren say, should have failed in this first
Synod, and also the Apostles with them, if they neglected to exercise
juridicall power over their own Congregation in the case of scandal, and a
scandal as possible to them to fall in as the Gentiles, and therefore either
this assembly consisting of Apostles and of the particular Church of Jerusalem
erred, which we cannot say, or then they did exercise power in order to
excommunication toward their own Church, and so there is some juridicall
power put forth in this meeting.

Object. 11. Though the Apostles in this Synod proceed by way of disputing and
borrow light one from another, it follows not th^^ they go not on here as
Apostles, yea though Peter and Paul d^e not say all the truth, nor fall upon
that which is the conclusion of the Assembly, as I ames does, it does not
hinder but they are led in all these Synodicull deba^e^ by the infallible and
Apostolic spirit, because some things are revealed to one Evangelist and to
one Prophet, which is not revealed to another; John the Divine saw visions and
heavenly mysteries which none of the rest of the Apostles saw, nor could write
in their writings and Canonical Epistles, yet it does not hence follow that
James, Peter, Jude and Paul in their canonical writings and Epistles were not
immediately inspired. It is enough to make the Apostles in their writings
infallible Apostles and immediately inspired, if that which they write be the
infallible truth and canonick Scripture, though every Apostle write not all
canonick truth; now what the Apostles sets down in this Synod is Scripture,
and the object of our faith, and written for our instruction; so something was
revealed to James which was not revealed to Peter and Paul in this dispute, but
it follows not, Ergo, what Peter and Paul spoke, they spoke it not by
immediate revelation, and what they spoke is not Scripture.

Answ. 1. The strength of my argument is close mistaken, for I did not argue
simply from the Apostles borrowing light one from another, to prove they act
not here as Apostles but as Elders, neither did I argue simply from this, James
says more then Peter does, Ergo, Peter is not immediately inspired in what he
says: for I grant the Apostles borrow ^ight from the Prophets, and their
writings, one says and writes what another says not, and cannot write, and
yet all are immediately inspired, in what they write. But I argued thus; when
ever the Apostles are consulted with to resolve a question as Apostles and do
conveen^ Synodically and intend to resorve the question if the Apostles in that
case, or any one of them come short of the resolution, and do not see the
conclusion they intend to see, but in so sarre as they are helped on by another
in a way of disputation, in that they do not act as Apostles, but the case is
so here; 1. all were consulted with, Act. 15. 2. (2) all intended to resolve
the question, and did meet together for that end to resolve it fully, v. 6. (3)
yet diverse of the Apostles, as Peter, Paul and Barnabas see not the resolution
fully that they aimed at, but determine the question imperfectly, and so, as if
James had been absent, or if he had seen no more in resolving the question,
then Paul and Barnabas and Peter said, which was only that the Law of Moses
was not to be kept by either Jew or Gentile, upon the Necessity of salvation,
but that both Jews and Gentiles are saved by the grace of Jesus Christ; if
James (I say) had seen no more then this, the consciences of both sides had
not been satisfied, and the question not resolved, but the Jews should have
gone on in a total abstinence from all ceremonies, which because of the
indifference of the ceremonies, was then dangerously scandalous, and spiritual
homicide, and the Gentiles should freely have eaten blood, meats offered to
idols, and things strangled, which also was scandalous in a high measure to the
weak Jews, and so the matter should have been worse after this Synod, and
the controversy hotter, the fire bolder, and the scandal more dangerous then
it was before the Synod, which I cannot believe that the Apostles as Apostles
could have done; So we know Nathan to have spoken as a man, and not as a
Prophet, when being consulted with by David anent the building of the Temple,
and purposing and intending fully to resolve the question, yet resolved it
amiss and quite contrary to the mind of God; now what the penmen of holy
Scripture intended to write as Scripture, that they fully wrote and no more,
and what they wrote not, that they intended not to write, but leave it to
others of the penmen of the holy Ghost, because the immediately inspiring holy
Ghost consulted with and intending to resolve such a canonick truth, cannot
miss in his blessed intention. And also the Elders at Jerusalem were consulted
with to resolve the question as well as the Apostles, as is clear Act. 15. 2.
Now if the Church of Antiech had been minded to refer the resolution to the
Apostles as infallibles Apostle, they would never have referred it to the
Elders, whom they knew could err as well as themselves, nor would the Elders
have joined as fellow-disputers with the Apostles as Apostles, as they expressly
do, v. 6. for that is as you would say, some country men of ordinary spirit
destitute of all prophetical light concurred with Esaiah to see the visions of
God; And it is as if David as king counsel at God, whether the men of Keilah
would deliver him up to Saul, had consulted with God and with Abiathar, and
some four or five Elders of Keilah void of all prophetical spirit, whether
the men of Keilah should deliver him up to Saul, or no: for these Elders of
Jerusalem and Antioch and other brethren were as void of an Apostolic spirit
as the Elders of Keilah were of a Prophetical spirit. It were a vain action
for the Elders to join themselves as joynt-disputers and fellow-resolvers of
the controversy with the Apostles, for the fellow-resolvers were to seek
resolution at the Apostles, who could as Apostles infallibly resolve them.

2. What the Apostles set down is Scripture, and is the object of our faith,
and written for our instruction, Ergo, the Apostles did give it forth in the
Synod as Scripture, it follows not: I may preach Scripture, and that which is
the object of faith, and written for our instruction, Ergo, I preach it as an
Apostle by an Apostolic spirit, it follows not; for so if the Elders had
spoken Scripture which is written for our instruction, the Elders should have
spoken it by an Apostolic spirit, which is manifestly false; and so if the
Elders of Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. should have proven in their Presbytery that the
incestuous person should be delivered to Satan, from Matthew. 18. they should
have spoken that in the presbytery by an Apostolic Spirit: all which are
manifestly false. The holy Ghost by Luke did make it Scripture formally, but
that the Apostles spoke it as Scripture by an Apostolic spirit, because it is
the object of our faith that Luke did insert it in the Canonical history, is
no more hence proven then one might infer that Gamaliel by the immediate
inspiration of the Spirit spoke the oration that he utters to the council
of Priests and Pharisees, Act. 5. 34, 35. and c. for that is formally made
Scripture by Luke his inserting of it in the Register of Scripture; yea the
words of Satan, Matthew. 4. by that reason behoved to be spoken by divine and
immediate inspiration: but the truth is, we are not to take what Peter
speaks from the Prophet Amos, Act. 15. v. 16. to be Scripture, because Amos
spoke it in the Old Testament, but because Luke by immediate inspiration says
that Peter uttered these words from the Prophet Amos. Immediate inspiration
makes any saying Scripture, and not the Apostles historical relating of it
out of the writings of the Prophets, though the sayings of the Prophets as they
are registered in the books of Old Testament be formally Scripture, yet as
cited by the Apostles they d^e not become Scripture, except these saying, be
cited, tali modo, that is, by the influence of the immediately inspiring holy
Ghost, which influence only makes formally any saying to be Scripture.

Object. 12. If the Apostles did not in a Synod, with the Elders dispute and
voice as Apostles, it should follow that as Apostles, they did plant Churches,
but after the Churches were planted they ceased to be Apostles, and did all as
ordinary Elders, which is most incongr^o^s, for then should they descend from
an infallible to a fallible spirit.
Answ. The Apostles did only use their Apostolic power, when there was need
of it; as God works not miracles, but in some necessitating exigence of
second causes: and what they could do by an ordinary power, when the Churches
were once constituted, they did not attempt to do by their Apostolic power;
and though their Apostolic power was in them as a habit, yet the exercise
thereof was rather under the dominion of an extraordinary and immediate rapt
and influence of God, then under the mastery of their own freewill. I would
ask why the Church of Antioch, no doubt most lawfully, Act. 15. 2. did send to
seek resolution at the fallible spirit of Elders, and also (as our brethren
teach) at the infallible spirit of the Apostles? and why did they not from
their infallible and Apostolic spirit seek out and choose seven men to be
Deacons, but remitted to the fallible spirit of the multitude who are not
infallible or Apostolic in their choice, both the nomination and election of
these seven men; but the Apostles did much honor the Churches of Christ in
cooperating with them, and in doing most things with their consent, that by
example they might interdict dominion, and assert a ministerial power, and
make Christ most Monarch-like in the government of his spiritual Kingdom: nor
did they put off, or interdict themselves, nor forfeit their Apostolic power,
after Churches were constituted, but used their Apostolic power at the
Commandment of that great King exalted Jesus Christ, whose Catholic
Ambassadors they were, as God immediately moved them.

Object. 13. Paul exercised the power of the Keys of knowledge upon
Barbarians, and might have preached to Indians, and did pres^h to the scefling
Athenians. Ergo, he might exercise power of jurisdiction over them, and judge
those who are without, it is no consequence, and against the word of God, 1
Cor. 5. 12. Yea Paul by this power dogmaticall rebuked the Athenians, Act. 17.
22. I perceive that in Mr. Mather against Mr. Herle, c. 4 p. 43, 44.
all things ye are too superstitious, yet Paul had no power to excommunicate
the Athenians. Mr. Mather.
Answ. I deny not, but there is great odds betwixt a concionall rebukin^, by
way of preaching, which may be, and is always performed by one, and a
juridicall rebuking by a power juridicall of the Keys, which is performed
only by a Church-s^ci^tie: now it cannot be denied but the rebuking of men,
because they subverted souls, v. 24. is not a mere concionall rebuking, which
may be performed by one; 1. it is a rebuking, v. 24. (2) it is a rebuking
performed by many, by a whole Synod, v. 6. v. 22. (3) It is performed by a
political society and body having a dogmaticall power to judge and determine
in a doct^inall way, as our brethren say, and consequently as we say, having a
juridicall power, v. 25. It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one
accord, to send chosen men unto you, etc. which is undenyably a political
body, an assembled company, as v. 6. met about a question which concerns the
Churches of Christ, as is clear, v. 2. v. 6. v. 23. c. 16. 4, 5. c. 21. 25.
compared with v. 22. hence a business of doctrine which troubles the Churches
of Antioch, c, 15. 2. and of Jerusalem, v. 5, 6, 7, 8. and Syria and Cilicia,
v. 23, 24. must be a Church-businesse in respect of the subject. 2. The
question is a Church-question in the matter of practice, it cono^rneth the
consciences of the Churches in the point of taking and giving offense, in a
Church-societie as this does, v. 19. That ye trouble not them which amongst
the Gentiles are turned unto God, and v. 28, 29. compared with 1 Cor. 10. 24,
25, 26, 27, and c. Romans 14. 14, 15. this was a Church-^candall or public
offense, as touching the matter, materia qu^nt. (2) The form and manner of
deciding the controversy was a public Church Way by the Word of God, Act. 15.
so (...) proves, v. 7, 8. 9. and James, v. 15, 16, etc. makes good. (4) The
efficient causes and agents in the question, are 1. Church-(...), v. 6.
Apostles and Elders. 2. Church Officers conveened Church-wayes in a Church-body
or society, v. 6. c. 15. and The Apostles and Elders came together (in a
Synod, (...), a word which cur brethren acknowledges does, 1 Cor. 5. 4. note a
formal Church-assembly) to consider of this matter, and ^, 25. It seemed good
to us being assembled with one accord, (...), and the very word Church is not
wanting though with reverence of others, it seems not to be the multitude,
seeing the word (...), being so general, must have its signification from the
action and end, for which the meeting is intended, as before I said) as is
clear, v. 22. It pleased the Apostles, Elders, and whole Church. 5. The action
they perform, when they are met in a political body, is to decide a
Church-controversie, that troubled many Churches, Act. 15. 2. v. 23, 24. (6)
The end is the peace and edifying of the Churches, as that the Churches of the
Gentiles be not troubled with needless ceremonies, as James says, v. 19. and
the good of the Churches, v. 29. from which if you keep your selves, ye shall
do well, c. 16. 4. And ^s they went through the cities they delivered them the
Decrees to (...), v. 5. so were the Churches established in the faith. Consider
(...) is the happy end and fruit of this Synod; The establish^^^ of the
Churches. Therefore have our brethren without reason (I speak with reverence
of their learning and godlinese) denied the word Church to be given to a
Synod, or a meeting of Elders, which to me is clear, Act. 15. v. 6. The (...)
sending is the Eldership of Antioch; the Church recei^^^, v. 4. is the
Eldership at Jerusalem, and cannot conveniently be exponed of the whole and
numerous thousands that ^^e^ed at Jerusalem; the rebuking cannot then be
merely ^ ^^^inall by the power of the keys of knowledge which is exercised by
one, nor are the Apostles and Elders here considered as merely Preachers and
Teachers in the Act of teacher, for why then should they not be formally a
Church and a Church-assembly, as our Brethren say, if they be an assembly
meeting for preaching the Word? for the exercise of the keys of Knowledge in
the hearing of a multitnde is essentially an act of preaching the Word.

Object. 14. This Synod declares only in a doctrinall way what is necessary,
what is scandalous, the same way, that Paul does, Romans 14. 14, 15. i Cor. 8. 1
Cor. 10.
Answ. This Synod and Paul declare one and the same thing, Ergo, with one and
the same authority, it follows not; Paul writes, 1 Cor. 5. that the
incestuous man should be excommunicated, and this he wrote as canonical
Scripture, by the immediate inspiration, of the holy Spirit, if then the Church
of Corinth should have excommunicated him, shall it follow that they gave out
the sentence of excomunication by the immediate inspiration of the holy Spirit?
I think not, their Churches sentence had been given out by a mere
ecclesiastical authority, according to the which Churches of Christ to the
worlds end does excommunicate, following the Church of Corinth as a pattern.

Obj. 15. Though these obtruders of ceremonies did pervent so^ks, v. 24. yet
the Synod does not summond them before them, nor excommuncite them, but remit
them to the particular Churches to whom it properly belonged to censure, and
not to any Synod, or superior Judicature.
Answ. There was no need to summon them, for these subverters of souls were
personally present at the Synod, and rebuked in the face of the Synod as
perverters of souls, v. 24. for if they were not present; 1. to whom does
Peter speak, v. 10. Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke on the
neck of the disciples, etc. the Apostles and Elders did not impose the yoke
of Moses Law upon the believing disciples, nor any other, save only the
obtruders of circumcision. 2. Who were they in the Synod who made much
disputing? v. 7. note the Apostles, not any save these obtruders. Ergo, they
were personally present at the Synod, nor needed they to excommunicate them,
for I judge that they acquiesced to the determination of James, which was the
sentence of the Synod, and the great dispute spoken of, v. 7. ceased, v. 13.
and the conclusion is agreed upon, 22. (...) then it seemed good to the
Apostles, Elders and whole Church, and there was reason why these obtruders
should acquiesce, so that there was no need of further censure, for there was
satisfactiou in part given to both siddes. The question was, whether or no are
believers now to keep the Law and the ceremonies of Moses his Law? It was
answered by the Synod, by a distinction which favored, in part, both sides, 1.
There is no necessity that the believing Gentiles who are saved by grace as
well as the Jews be troubled to keep all the ceremonies, and this satisfied
the Apostles who taught that the Gentiles were now made one people with the
Jews, and both are freed in conscience from Moses his yoke, the other part of
the distinction it was this, yet there be some ceremonial commandments, as
not to eat things offered to Idols, blood, and things strangled, (for
fornication is of another nature, and abstinence therefrom is of perpetual
necessity, 1 Cor. 6. 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. Col. 3. 5.) these must be
avoided, for scandals sake, by all the Jews, but especially by the Gentiles,
lest the weak Jews, who take these to be divine commandments yet in force,
take offense, and this was satisfactorie to the obtruders, and we hear no
more of their disputing, and there is an end of the controversy by the blessed
labors of a lawful Synod. 3. I could easily yield that there is no necessity
of the elicit acts of many parts of government, such, as excommunication,
ordination, admitting of heathens professing the faith to Church Membership, in
Synods provincial, national or oecumenicall, but that Synods in the case of
neglect of presbyteriall-Churches, command these particular Churches whom it
concerns, to do their duty, and in this sense the Synod, Act. 15. is to
remit the censure of excommunication to the presbytery of Antioch and
Jerusalem, in the case of the obstinacy of these obtruders of circumcision,
but so some power of government is due to the Synod, as prescribing of Laws
and Canons for presbyteries and Congregations.

Object. 16. Therefore was the Synagogue of the Jews no complete Church,
because all the ordinances of God cannot be performed in the Synagogue, and
therefore were the Jews commanded only at Jerus salem and in no other place
to keep the passover, and to offer offerings and sacrifices, which were
ordinary worship, Deuteronomy. 12. but there is not any worship or sacred ordinance,
(says that Ames Medul. Theolo. lib. 1. c. 38. chapter 37. lib. 1. 39. these 26.
worthy Divine Dr. Ames) of preaching, praying, Sacraments, and c. prescribed,
which is not to be observed in every Congregation of the New Testament: Nor is
there any ordinary minister appointed who is not given to some one Assembly of
this kind. So also A modest and brotherly answer to Mr. Herle, c. 2. p. 12. 13.
Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson, teachers in New England. Others say because there
was a representative worship of sacrificing of all the 12. Tribes at Jerusalem,
therefore all the Synagogues were dependent Churches, and Jerusalem was the
supreme and bighest Church, but there is no representative worship in the New
Testament, and therefore no need of Synods, as higher Churches.

Answ. Surely the aforesaid reverend Brethren of New England have these words,
Ib. c. 1. page 8.
But it seems to us that the power (of a Synod) is not proporly a power and
exercise of government and jurisdiction, but a power of doctrine, and so a
Synod is rather a ^aching then a governing Church; from which I infer; 1.
That out Brethren cannot deny a power of governing to a Synod, but it is not so
proper governing, as excommunication and ordination performed in their
Congregations, but (say I) it is more properly governing, as to make Laws and
rules of governing, is a more noble, eminent and higher act of governing (as is
evident in the King and his Parliament) then the execution of these Laws and
rules. 2. Our brethren incline to make a Synod a teaching Church; but I infer
that Synodicall teaching by giving out decrees tying many Churches, as our
Brethren of Church Government of New England, Answer to q. 14. page 43, 44.
New England, and the forenamed Mr Mather and Mr. Thomson Answer to Mr. Herle,
c. 4 page 40, 41, sig.
authors teach, is an ordinance of Christ that can be performed in no single
Congregation on earth, for a doctrinall Canon of one Congregation can lay no
ecclesiastical tie upon many Churches. Ergo, by this reason our Congregations
shall be dependent, as were the Jewish Synagogues. 3. With favor of these
learned men it is a begging of the question to make Jerusalem the supreme
Church, and the Synagogues dependent Churches, because it was lawful only at
Jerusalem to sacrifice, for I hold that Jerusalem was a dependent Church no
less then the smallest Synagogue in all the tribes, for in a Catholic meeting
of all Judah for renewing a Covenant with God, Jerusalem was but a sister
Church, with all of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, Manasseh, who 2 Chronicles. 15. 9. 10.
11, 12. made up one great Church which did swear that Covenant. Ordinances do
not formally make Churches visible, nor diverse ordinances diverse Churches;
profession of the truth formally constituteth a visible Church, and Church
union in ordinances and government, and this was alike in the Synagogues and in
Jerusalem. It was a thing merely typical that at Jerusalem only, and in the
Temple only should there be offerings and sacrifices, because in Christ
God-man, all our worship and service and prayers are accepted of the Father,
but (I pray you) did this instampe Jerusalem with any note of Church-supremacy
above the meanest Synagogue in all Israel and Judah? I see it not, all the
Synagogues and all the land were members of the national Church, and every one
a member of his own Synagogue, the persons processing the truth and dwelling
at Jerusalem had no supremacy over the Synagogues, because they did inhabit
that typical place, but the Priests and Levites were indeed servants to all
the land, in offering sacrifices, and in governing in the Synedry either the
greater, or the less, but these professors who did constitute the visible
Church at Jerusalem had no Church supremacy at all for their relation to the
Temple, their cohabitation or bodily contiguitie was no Church-relation then or
now; and that these of the Synagogues behooved to worship in some solemn acts
only at Jerusalem, did no more give supremacy to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
to be a Church over them, then the Synagogues could claim supremacy over the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, for the inhabitants of Jerusalem were tied to worship
there, and in no other place, and to stand to the determinntion of the great
Synodrie without appeal, because there was not a Catholic visible Church in
the world but the Church of the Jews; and this argument with as great force of
reason might conclude that all the cities and incorporations of England are in
government dependent and subordinate to London and the suburbs, because they
are subordinate to the honorable Houses of Parliament, if we should suppone
that Westminster by a standing Law of the Kingdom were the unal^erable seat
where the Parliament can fit, and in no other place, which yet could prove
nothing, seeing London and the suburbs are in their government no less
subordinate to the Parliament, then the meanest village and town in England,
and therefore I see no ground, because some representative worship was tied to
Jerusalem, to give Jerusalem a Church-supremacie, 2. because one Congregation
does pray for another that is under pestilence and diseases, and praises God
for the deliverance from these evils which also is a sort of representative
worship (every Church and person partaking of a Christian priesthood to offer
up prayers and praises one for another) it will not (as I conceive) prove that
one Congregation has Church-supremacie, and power of jurisdiction over
another. Because 1. all Israel was alike circumcised; 2. all alike the called
people of God, in covenant with God; 3. all had claim to the Altar,
Sacrifices, Temple, Arc, etc. 4. All alike professed their subjection to God,
to Priests and Prophets in these same ordinances, whether typical, or
judicial, or moral, therefore every Synagogue alike at Jerusalem, at Dan or
Bersheba, were alike Congregationall Churches, without dependence one upon
another, and all depended upon the whole national Church, and on the Synodries
supreme, subordinate, and the Synagogue-government according to their
subordinations respectively; and I see no national Church in Israel peculiar
to them, or typical, more then there is a national Church in Scotland or
England, though God put some distinguishing typical notes upon their
government, yet it never made either the invisible or visible Church of the
Jews to differ in nature and essence from the Christian Churches.

Object. 17. From the power of jurisdiction, in a Synod, you may infer a
power of jurisdiction, in a national Church, and a power of jurisdiction in
the whole Christian world, and we know not any Political Church Catholic and
visible in Scripture, and if then were any such Church Catholic, then might
they conveene and sweart a Catholick-covenant for uniformitie of doctrine,
worship, and government of the Church, as we have done in Britain, and this
Catholic Church might impose it, upon a national Church, even by that same
Law of proportion, by which the national Church may impose it on particular
Churches which are parts of the National Church.
Answ. I see not how the consequence holds every way good, that as we
infer from a juridicall power in a presbytery, the same power juridicall in a
Synod, and the same in a national Assembly, that therefore we may infer the
same juridicall power in an Oecumenick council: and the reasons of the
disparitie I take to be these; 1. The farther remote in local distance of
place that Churches be, (as it falls out in the Catholic visible Church)
the danger of scandalizing one another, by visible communion, and so the
opportunity of edifying one another is the less, and so the communion visible
is the less, and consequently the power of jurisdiction is the less. 2. An
universal and oecumenick council of all the visible Churches on earth, is an
act of the visible Church which supposes all the visible Churches on earth to
be in that moral perfection of soundness of faith, of concord and unity,
that some one Congregation or classical presbytery of Elders according to Gods
heart may be in, which moral perfection perhaps is not de facto attainable,
(though it be not physically impossible) in this life, except we suppose the
heavenly days of Christ's visible reign on earth a thousand years, when yet
there shall be no Temple nor external ministry, of which state I cannot now
dispute, and therefore I conceive these sixteen hundred years there never was
an integrall and perfect oecumenick council of all the Churches on earth, and
therefore if we should dispute of the juridicall power of such a Catholic
assembly whether it may impose an oecumenick and Catholic oath on a national
Church against their will, and excommunicate a national Church, is but a
needless and a Ch^mericall dispute, and it includes two contradictory
suppositions. 1. That all the Churches on earth are of one sound faith,
worship, doctrine and Church Government, and yet one national Church is
supposed to be heterodox, scandalous, and obstinate, so that that whole
national Church must be constrained to take a lawful oath and must be
excommunicated; such an hypothesis is not possible where the Gospel is
preached, for even the whole Romish Church in all its members deserves not
excommunication, in respect we are sure God has thousands in the bosom of
that Church; who believe in Christ, and do not defend popery with obstinacy,
and such an hypothesis is contradicent to the supposition of the soundness of
faith and unity of all Christian Churches on earth, and therefore I plainly
deny that Christ has given the like power of jurisdiction to the Catholic
visible Church, that he has given to a national Church, over a provincial
Church or Synod, and to a Synod over a classical Presbytery; yea I much doubt
if a Catholic council can formally excommunicate a national Church, though
such a council may use a power analogicall like to the power of
excommunication.

Object. 18. But you cannot demonstrate from Gods Word, that there is such a
thing in the New Testament, as a Catholic visible Church.
Answ. I said something of this before, but I conceive the subject of the 1
Cor. 12. is a Catholic, visible Church, But, 1. we do not understand a
political body with ordinary visible government from one man who makes
himself the vicar of Christ, the Pope, whose members are Cardinals, Bishops,
and c. and such like. But the Catholic body mystical of Jesus Christ, and
that as visible: and 1. that the Apostle is to be understood of an universal,
not of a Congregationall and particular politic Church that meets in one
place, is clear; 1. he speaks of that Church wherein are diversities of
gifts for the good of the whole Catholic body, as miracles, the gift of
prophecy, the gift of interpretation, the gift of healing, etc. of whom he
says, v. 5, 6. there is the same spirit, and the same God, who works all in
all, the particular Congregation is not such an all in all. 2. He speaks of
such a Church as takes in all baptized into one spirit, but this is the whole
visible Church, not one single Congregation only. 3. He speaks of such a
Church as takes in all, both Jews and Gentiles, making them one body, v. 13.
and that takes in all the world. 4. He speaks of such a Church as has an
adequat and full relation to Christ, from which this Church is denominated
Christ mystical, all the believers meeting in one mystical body of Christ, as
lines in one center, v. 12. now a single Congregation has not a foot to fill
this measure. 5. He speaks of such a body as has need of the help one of
another, as the head has need of the feet, v. 15, 16, 17. those of a single
Congregation have need of those, who are eyes and ears without the
congregation. 6. He speaks of such a body, as is not to separate in their
members, one from another, to make a schism in the body. v. 25. but a single
Congregation ought not to separate from the rest of the great body made up of
many sister Churches. 7. He speaks of such a body, the members whereof must
care one for another, and suffer one with another, v. 26. now single
Congregations are such members of this great body, as must mourn with these
that mourn and rejoice with these that rejoice, therefore one single
Congregation cannot be this whole body, but its part only. 8. He speaks of
such a body in which God has set, v. 28. Apostles, Prophets, Teachers,
mi^^cles, etc. now Christ has not wedged in Apostles the Catholic Pastors of
the whole world, to one single Congregation, nor has he confined such a
multitude of officers ordinary and extraordinary to one single Congregation.
And that he speaks here of a Catholic visible Church is clear; 1. He
speaks of such a body, to which is given the manifestation of the spirit to
profit withal, v. 7. this must be a visible policy. 2. He speaks of a
political and organicall body, having eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc. which
must be a visible ministry. 3. He speaks of a body capable of the seals,
such as Baptism, v. 13. We all are baptized by one spirit into one body, this
must be a visible baptized body; discerned by the visible character of
baptism from all societies of Jews, Pagans, and others who profess not
Christ Jesus. 4. He speaks of such a body as stands in need of the help
one of another, as the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of the, v.
21. this evidently cries that he supposes a visible and external policy in
this body. 5. He speaks of a body so tempered of God, as that there should
be no schism in the body, nor separation from it, v. 25. now this cannot be
a separation from the invisible body of Christ, for so hypocrites which are
members of this visible body, and are often officers, as eyes and ears, yea
Pastors, and Teachers remaining in the body without any schism or separation,
are yet separatists from the invisible body of Christ, and no more parts of
that body, then a wooden leg or arm is a member of a living man. 6. He
speaks of that body which is to express its care in praying, praising,
mourning and rejoicing with the rest of the members as they are in a good or
adverse condition of prosperity or adversity, v. 23, 26. and this must be a
visible Church praying or praising God. 7. He speaks of such a Church as the
fellow members may see and know by their senses, to suffer, and be in a hard
condition, or to rejoice, as v. 25. 26. and this is more then apparently clear
to be a visible Church. 8. He speaks of such a Church as God has furnished
with several officers, in several orders visibly known to be different
officers, as v. 28. Now God has set some in the Church, first Apostles,
secondarily Prophets, thirdly teachers, these be parts and most eminent and
considerable organs of a visible Church. And the like I might prove by diverse
of these arguments of that body political of which the Apostle speaks, Romans
12. 3, 4, 5, 6. to the end of the Chapter. These special exceptions there be
against this. 1. That the Church, 1 Cor. 12. is the invisible and mystical
body of Christ, because it is a body baptized by one spirit. 2. A body called
Christ, that is Christ mystical. Answ. It is true that this visible body has
also an inward and spiritual baptizing, answerable to the external and
outward baptizing, and so according to that internal and mystical union it is
an invisible body, as these reasons prove: but the question is, if the Apostle
speak of the body of Christ in that notion, we deny that, for he speaks
plainly here of the Church, as it is a political, organicall and visible body.

Object. 2. If one should say, God has placed in the commonwealth Emperors,
Kings, Dukes, Princes and Rulers, as the eyes and ears of the Commonwealth, it
should no ways follow that all the Commonwealths in the earth are one visible
civil body having a government, so though it he said God has placed in the
spiritual Commonwealths of the Church Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, etc. it
follows not that the Church is all one spiritual, politic visible body, it
follows only that the Lord has placed in the Church Apostles, Prophets,
Teachers indefinitly, that is, that these may be in any one single
Congregation, as it is said, James 2. 2. If there come into your Assembly, or
Synagogue, a man with a gold Ring, etc. now this will not prove that all the
dispersed Jews, to whom James wrote, were all but one Congregation.
Answ. 1. It is true, if any should say, God has placed in the Commonwealth
Emperors, Kings, Dukes, Princes, it should not follow that Commonwealths are
one body, even Jews, Gentiles, Barbarians, Americans, because there is not
this external union of visible Communion in the Commonwealths of the earth,
as there is in the Churches; but if one should say, God has placed Emperors,
Kings, Dukes, Princes in the Commonwealths, as in one organicall body, having
one head who has given influence to so many Orgins of head feet, hands, eyes,
ears, etc. as the Apostle speaks of this body of the Church, he should then
say all the Commonwealths of the world made but one body, but this indefinite
speech must, by good logic, have the virtue either of an universal or a
particular proposition, as if I say (The Church has seated in it Apostles,
Prophets, Teachers, etc.) you mean either the Cathlick visible Church, or the
particular Congregation, or 3. some Church betwixt these two: our brethren
cannot say they mean of a middle Church, for then they grant (contrary to
their own principles) a political visible Church, beside a Congregation; if
they say the first, we have what we crave; if they say that the Congregation
has seated in it Apostles, Prophets, they fall in the former absurdity, for
God has placed Apostles, in the whole Christian world.

Object. 3. When the Apostle says, v. 21. The head cannot say to the feet, I
have no need of you; either must we acknowledge here that ^ee means the head
of a Congregation, to wit a Pastor, or a Doctor, and so he speaks here of a
Congregation; or if he speak of the Catholic Church, then Estius his
argument may stand in force to (...) the Pope to be the head of the Church;
for Estius exponing these needs (The head cannot say to the feet, I have no
need of you) by the head of the Catholic Church (says he) you either
understand Christ the principal head, or then, some mortal man, the Pope, who
is a ministerial head; the former you cannot say, because Christ being God,
and also man perfectly happy, he may say to all the members of his Church
great and small, yea to the very Angels, I have no need of you; for he can
sanctify and govern his Church without the ^^d, the Sacraments, or any
ministers, therefore the head which (...) in need of the feet, must be the
ministerial head the Pope, (...) stands in need of the feet for the
governing of the body in a ministerial way.

I answer, there is no reason for a Popish argument to leave the truth, for
this argument shall no less militate against cur brethren, then against us,
because it shall prove that there is a ministerial head and Pope in every
Congregation, which is no less absurd then to make a Catholic head over all
the visible Catholic Church. Secondly, as for the argument it is easily
answered, for the Apostle here uses a comparison from the natural body, and
there is no ground to press every to^, lith and sinew of a comparison; and we
deny that the word (head) here does signify literally either Pastor or Bishop,
for the eye also being that which watches and sees for the whole body should
also signify the Pastor, but the intent of the Spirit of God is, that the most
eminent members which are as the eyes and the head, whether their eminency be
excellency of saving grace, called, gratia gratum faciens, or excellency of
gifts, called, gratia gratis data, they have need of the gifts and graces of
others inferiors and of meaner parts, and there is neither ministerial head,
nor ministerial feet, nor ministerial eyes in the Text.

Object. 4. To every visible Church there should be a Paster to feed and rule
that Church, if then there be here a Catholic visible Church, there is should
also be a Catholic visible Pastor, and that is a Pope.
Answ. That to every Church meeting (...) into one place, for Word and
Sacraments, there should be one Pastor only and a supreme one, I deny; there
may be more Pastors then one, but that to every Catholic Church there should
be one head most eminent, that is far rather to be denied, for this is so
great a flock that there be a necessity of multitude of Pastors and watchmen
to attend so Catholic a flock.

Object. 19. You teach that the government of consociated Churches is warranted
by the light of nature, which if it be true, surely this light of nature being
common to us, in civil, as in ecclesiastical ca^ses, then by natures light
every city governed with rulers within it self, is suberdinate to a Class of
many cities, and that Class to a national meeting of all the cities, and the
nation must in its government be subordinate to a Catholic or ^ecumenick
civil court, and Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson, answ. to Mr. Herle, c. 2. p. 16
and p. 20.
this same way may appeals ascend in civil courts; and because by the same
light of nature (says Mr. Mather, and Mr. Thomson) there must be some final
and supreme judgment of controversies le^t ^ppeaks should be spun out in
infinitum, it must be proved that this sup^em (...) lies not in a
Congregation.

Answ. 1. Appeals being warranted by the moral counsel which Je^hro gave to
Moses, in which there is nothing typical or ^remoniall, but a pattern that
all Commonwealths on earth, without any danger of Judaizing may fellow, cannot
but be (as Whittaker has observed) natural, and supposing that God has
given warrant in his word, for Monarchies, which are known by Gods appointment
to be independent, as also the government of all free and unconquered States
are, it does follow by the light of nature, that appeals in all states are
natural, and that God has appointed that the supremacy should lie within the
bounds of every free Monarchy or State, so that there can be no appeal to
any oecumenicall or Catholic civil Court, for that is against the independent
power that God has given to States; but in the Church it is far otherwise,
for God has appointed no visible Monarchy in his Church, nor no such
independencie of policy within an congregation classical, provincial or
national Church and therefore though appeals be warranted both in Church and
State, by the light of nature, yet appeals to exotic and foreign judicatures
is not warranted by any such light, but rather contrary thereunto.

2. Church-appeales, though warranted by the light of nature, yet it is
supposed they be rational, and grounded on good reason, as that either the
matter belong not to the congregation, or then it be certain or morally
presumed the Congregation will be partial and unjust, or the business be
difficill and intricate, and if appeals be grcundlesse and unjust, neither
Christ, nor natures light does warrant them, yea in such a case the supremacy,
from which no man can lawfully appeal, lies sometime in the Congregation,
sometime in the classical presbytery, so as it is unlawful to appeal, for
illud tantumpossumus quod jure possumus, and neither Christ nor natures light
does warrant us to unjust appeals, or to any thing against equity and reason:
but that supremacy of power should be in a Congregation without any power of
appealing, I think our brethren cannot teach; for when the Church of Antioch
cannot judge a matter concerning the necessity of keeping Moses his Law, or
any difficill dogmaticall point, they by natures direction, Act. 15. 2. decree
to send Pau', Barnabas and others to Jerusalem to the Apostles and Elders, as
to a higher judicature, that their truth may be determined, and this they did
without any positive law that we can imagine: for Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson
Answer to Mr. Herle c. 4 p. 42.
Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson, as also Church Government and Church Covenant of
New England, Answ. to quest. 14. p. 44.
the Author of the Church government of New England teach that the Church of
Antioch had, jus, power to judge and determine the controversy, but because of
the difficulty had not light ^o judge thereof; Ergo they must acknowledge
appeals by natures light warrantable as well as we, for suppose we, that a
Congregation inclines to this (that Arminianisme is the sound doctrine of
grace opposite to Stoicisme) one man is cited before the Congregation for
holding the contrary, he knows all the Congregation in those points to be
Pelagians, would not our brethren say, that this man so unjustly accused for
holding the truth against the enemies of grace may appeal to a Synod? I think
they must teach this by their grounds, though by the way I think the brethren
err in this to teach that Antioch had power to determine the controversy,
Act. 15. in this case; 1. when the Churches of Syria and Cilicia, to their
knowledge, were troubled with the like question, as v. 24. may clear; 2. when
as the party against the truth was so prevalent within the Church of Antioch,
Act. 15. 2. as that they opposed the Apostle Pau', and Barnabas, also in this
case I doubt much if they had power to determine a question, that so much
concerned all the Churches, for that was proper to a Synod of many Churches. 2.
When the greatest part of a Church, as Antioch, is against the truth, as is
clear, Act. 15. 2. I believe in that they lose their jus, their right to
determine ea^enus, in so far, for Christ has given no ecclesiastical right
and power to determine against the truth, but only for the truth, and
therefore in this, appeals must be necessary. Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson
against Herle, c. 2. p. 17. 18. say we do much Judaizein that we multiply
appeals upon appeals, from the Congregation to a Class, then to a Synod,
then to a national assembly, then to an ^eckmenick council, and this way,
while the world indureth, causes are never determined, and Synods cannot
always be had, even as in Jerusalem the supreme judicature was far remote
from all proselytes, as from the Eunuch of Aethiopia, Act. 8. and from the
remotest parts of the holy Land; But God has provided better for us, in the
New Testament, where every Congregation, which is at hand, may decide the
controversy.

Answ. 1. The speediness of ending controversies in a congregation, is badly
compensed with the suddenness and temerity of delivering men to Satan, upon
the decision of three Elders, without so much as asking advise of any classes
of Elders, and with deciding questions deep and grave, that concerns many
Churches, which is a putting a private sickle in a common and public harvest.
2. All appeals without just warrant from Christ's will, we condemn, as the
abuse of appeals to a court, which is known shall never be. 3. Antiochs
appeal to a Synod two hundredth miles distant (as our brethren say) in so
weighty a question, was no Judaizing, but that which Paul and the Apostles was
guilty of, as well as we. 4. Matters concerning many Churches must be
handled by many.

The Doctrine of the Presbyteriall Churches of Jerusalem, Corinth, Ephesus,
Antioch, vindicated.
We are convinced from the numerous multitude of believers, and the multitude
of Pastors at this famous and mother Church of the Christians at Jerusalem, to
believe the frame and mould was presbyteriall, and that it cannot be so much
as imagined or dreamed that it was molded to the pattern of one single
Congregation which could all meet (...) into one place.

The frame of an independent single Congregation is such as no more do meet
ordinarily in one house, then may conveniently be edified, in partaking of one
Word, and one breaking of bread, that is, one Table at the Supper of the Lord;
nor can we imagine that the first mould of a Christian visible Church was so
inconvenient as that it crossed edification and conversion, which is the
formal effect of a Church-meeting: Now the multitude was such as could not,
neither morally; nor physically, meet in one house. For at one Table many
thousands and multiplied thousands could not mere and therefore consider their
number; they were, Act. 1. a hundredth and twenty met in one place, but I shall
not be of the opinion that this was all, seeing, 1 Cor. 15. 6. Christ after
his resurrection was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve, after that he was
seen of above five hundredth brethren; then in one day at one Sermon about
three thousand souls, Act. 2. 42. and chapter 4. 4. though they were apprehended
who preached the Gospel, yet many of them which heard the Word believed, and
the number of the men was about five thousand. I deny not but worthy Calvin
says, id potius de tota ecclesia, quam de nova accessione intelligendum, this
was the whole number including the three thousand that were converted, c. 2.
but first he says, Potius, he inclines rather to this opinion: but secondly
the Text says of those which heard the word, it would seem to me, at the
second Sermon of Peter, and Augustine,: rac 39. in Joan.

Lyranus, Cajetan. in loc.
Cajetanus; but we shall not contend about the matter, nor yet whether the word
(...) includes women, which it often does in the Greek, as (...) and (...) in
Demosthenes does also; yet the wisdom of God in the Apostles cannot admit us
to imagine that five thousand could ordinarily meet to the Word, Sacraments,
and government in one house, and after this many thousands were added to this
Church.

1. Our brethren say, it is one thing to say that they could not meet in one
place by reason of extrinsecall impediments of persecution, and through want of
a capacious and large room, and another thing to say, that it was unpossible
that they could be one Congregation, and meet in one place, for though we
prove they could not meet because of persecution, we do not prove that they
were so numerous that they could not conveniently meet in one place.

Answ. Though it be evident that the Apostles were persecuted, cast in prison,
and beaten, Act. 4. 3. c. 5. 18. 26. 33. 40. it is as evident that they had
Assemblies, and Churches meetings, Act. 2. 37. 41. 46. c. 4. 1, 2, 3. c. 5. 10.
v. 25. now the question then is not if they could not meet, for extrinsecall
impediments of persecution; for both our brethren and we agree in this, that
they had their Church Assemblies for Word and Sacraments, then the question is
upon the supposall of Church assembles, which the persecution of the Jews then
fearing the people was not able to hinder, c. 5. 26, whether or no was the
Church at Jerusalem of such a competent number, only as that they could meet
not occasionally only to hear a Sermon, but in an ordinary Church-meeting to
hear the Word, and communicate in the breaking of bread, and seals of the
Covenant; and though the want of a capacious house be also an extrinsecall
impediment why they could not meet, yet that they wanted such a capacious house
as the Temple, will prove nothing, but it cannot be said that they wanted a
capacious house for the ordinary meeting of a Congregation, the ordinary and
genuine use whereof is to be edified by the Word and Sacraments, and that an
ordinary house could contain such a number of thousands and multitudes as can
be edified in a Congregationall way, is denied.

2. Our brethren say; that they did not eat the Supper in private houses, for
the breaking of bread, Act. 2. 46. was common bread, and they had the use of
the Temple, and taught in the Temple, for the Senate of the Jews durst not
extend their malice to the highest, Act. 5. 26. for they feared the people, and
Act. 4. 21. So when they had s^^^her threatened them, they let them go, finding
nothing how they might punish them because of the people; for all men glorified
God, for that which was done, so the people favoring the Apostles, they made
use of their liberty to the full, and bad their public meetings for Word and
Sacraments in the Temple, and did meet in private houses, Act. 20. 20. in a
private way, not in a Church way, So Act. 2. 47. They had favor with all the
people.

Answ. It is said these believers, v, 44. were (...) in one place, and those
who, v. 46. did eat bread (...) from house to house, met then being in one
place, and (eating of bread from house to house) must be exponed as we do,
distributively, that is, divided in small Assemblies, for the argument that we
bring militateth against the eating of their common meat in houses, all being
in one private house; were three thousand in ^ne place, (...), all at one
banquet, and that daily? 2. It is true, diverse expone the breaking of bread, v.
46. not of the Supper of the Lords yet of the banquets of love where there was
an assembly of many; but v. 42. It is clear these three thousand did receive
the Supper of the Lord together, and it is so true that the Syriack has it in
his exposition thus (...) un^isht an^hephin bavau but luthi u^aktsa^a
deu^ha^rskia, it is memorable, says Lorinus, that he retains the name of
Eucharistia, it Lerinus com in ac. 2. 42.
is rendered, Et communica^ant in oratione and fractione Eucharistia, yea and
Lutherus Sermon. de Eucharistia.
Lutherus and Calvin, Inst^t. l. 4 c. 17.
Calvin both expound it so, and as Lorinus, ib.
Lorinus, Cajetan. com. ib.
Cajetanus, Corneli. a Lapide.
Cornelius a Lapide, they be all spiritual exercises named here. But how can
we imagine that many thousands could in one meeting communicate at one Table
in the Lords Supper, and that ordinarily? 1. What voice could reach to so many
thousands, as they did grow unto? 2. What Table could suffice to a Congregation
of so many thousands added to the Church, for the supper is a Table ordinance,
and requires Table communion, Table gestures, which the Apostles could not so
soon remove and change into an Altar, that all might conveniently hear and
be edified. 3. Can we believe, that seeing Congregationall meetings of fewer,
and that in private houses, was less obnoxious to the indignation of
authority, then meeting in the Temple, as is most evident, Act. 4. 1, 2. and
seeing the Apostles had liberty to meet, Act. 5. 26. that they would draw the
first mould of the Christian visible Church, after the pattern of a convention
most unfit, yea unpossible, for attaining the intended end, to w^t,
edification, especially not being compelled thereunto, by an extrinsecall
necessity. Our brethren say, three thousand, five thousand might all
communicate in one place, though not at one time, successively, as it is in
many numerous Congregations; But I answer 1. after they were five thousand, chapter
4. I dare say, taking in the hundredth and twenty, the five hundredth brethren
that all saw Christ at once, 1 Cor. 15. 6. and the fruit of the preaching of
the other ten Apostles, all now present at Jerusalem, when the (...) the Spirit
on all flesh, joe. 2. 28, 29. (...) 15, 16, 17. was now to take effect at this
time, there were (...) thousand, but after there all it is said, Act. 6. 1. The
(...) were multiplied, v. 7. And the Word of God (...), (...), The (...)
Disciples grew exceedingly, and (...) a great (...) the Priests were obedient
to the faith; how many of the people were then obedient to the faith? could all
these make on: Congregation to eat at one Table? But 2. when they are put to
this shift, to say, that they did communicate suc(...) Table, and (which must
be) not all in one day, then (...) brethren grant there was not here such a
Congregation as is, 1 Cor. 11. 20 When you come together therefore into one
(...) eat the Lords Supper, 23. Wherefore my brethren (...) together to eat,
(...), tarry one for another; when (...) come to eat at the love feasts,
especially at the Lords Supper, says Di^datus; if every one of the
Congregation be to wait on while another come, then in the Apostolic Church
all the Congregation came together to the Lords Supper to one place and at one
time, and this is not the Congregation where of he speaks, 1 Cor. 14. 23. if
therefore the whole Church come together to the same place, and all speak with
tongues, (...) in th^se that are unlearned and unbeleovers, will they (...)
mad? Hence all the Congegration come together to one place, at one time, and
the place was so that heathen and unbeleevers might come into their worship of
the Congregation, but our brethren make the meeting of this Congregation such
as they were not to s^ay one for another, (...) all at one time, but
successively, and so as the whole Congregation could not come to one place at
once, but by (...) and quarters, and fractions and divided parts, now one
(...), or two thousand, then another two thousand the next day, for the
Apostles then celebrating the supper at night and after Supper, 1 C^r. 11. 21.
few thousands should be able to communicate after Supper. 2. There was no
necessity, that these wise master builders should divide the Church, and the
first visible Church in so many parts, and this successive communion does
clearly prove our point, that there were many Congregations, for every
successive fraction being a competent convention of believers having the Word
and Sacraments, and so power of jurisdiction not to admit all promiscuously to
the Lords Table, is to our brethren a complete Church, for to it indeed agrees
the essential Characters of a visible instituted Church, for there is here a
ministry, the Word and Sacraments, and some power of jurisdiction within it
self, and so what lacks this successive fraction of an entire Congregation?

But what ground for so needless a conjecture, that the Apostolic Church did
celebrate the Lords Supper in the Temple, never in private houses? The contrary
is, Act. 20. 7. And upon the first day of the week the Disciples came together
to break bread, Paul preached unto them, v. 8. And there were many lights in
an upper Chamber, where they were conveened, so the Text is clear, the first
day of the week, 1 Cor. 16. 1. was the day of the Christians public worship,
and Augustine. ^ Epist. 86.
Augustine, Calvin, in loc.
Calvin, Luther. Sermon. de Eucharist.
Lu^her, Melancthon. lib de usu Sacrament.
Melancthon, Bullinger, Diodatus. ^nnot. in loc.
Diodatus; and so Lorinus in loc.
Lorinus and Sancks.
Sanchius say this was the Lords Supper, who can imagine that the Apostles did
bring so many thousand Christians after Supper to the Temple, to celebrate a
new Evangelick feast, and that immediately after Peter's first Sermon, Act. 2.
42? 1. Before the Apostles had informed the Jews, that all their typical and
ceremonial feasts were now abolished, yea while they stood in vigor, and the
Apostles themselves kept them in a great part? was this like the Spirit of the
Gospel, which did bear with Moses his ceremonies for forty years?

2. The Apostles, Act. 4. 1. are indicted before the Synedry, that they taught,
in the Temple, Jesus Christ: if they had with so many thousands, gone to the
Temple with a new extraordinary ceremonial ordinance as a new Sacrament, so
contrary in humane reason, to all the sacred Feasts, Sacrifices, and
ceremonies, should not this with the first have been put in their indictment,
that they were shouldering Moses out of the Temple? yet are they only accused
for teaching the people; yea Christ the Lawgiver, who preached the Gospel
daily in the Temple, would not take the last Supper to the Temple, but
celebrated it in a private Chamber; and Paul being accused always as an enemy
to Moses and the Temple, his enemies the Jews who watched him heedfully, could
never put on him, that he celebrated a Sacrament in the Temple: as for
Baptism it being a sort of washing, (whereof the Pharisees used many, Matthew.
15. Mark. 7.) it was performed often sub di^ in rivers, never in the Temple;
we desire any author, father, (Ocecumenius doubts only) Doctor, Divine,
Protestant, or Papist, late or old, who said the Apostles celebrated the Supper
in the Temple.

3. Our brethren say all, These did conve^ne (...), for Act. 4. 31. When they
had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together, (...), Act.
2. 46. and they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking
bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness.

Answ. The place, Act. 4. 31. says not, that all the five thousand believers
were in that one place, which was shaken, for v. 21. that when the Apostles
were let go by the Priests and Captains of the Temple they returned to their
own company (...), to their own, but no circumstance in the Text does infer
that they came back to the whole five thousand, but only to some few of the
first believers, that were converted before the first Sermon of Peter was made,
cap. 2, they returned, Lyra and Hugo Cardinalis, to their own company, ad
domesticos suos, and so says Lorinus, who cites the Syriack (...) hachaiehin
ad fratres suos. Salmeron, ad suos ^apostolos, sive condiscipulos and
domesticos fidei, and (...) does not signify the whole Church, but friends and
domestics, as, Mark. 5. 19. Go home to thy own house and show thy friends,
Luke, (...) compared with, Luke 8. 39. and Gal. 6. 10, (...), and 1 Timothy 5. 8.
therefore the place says that the five thousand were gathered together in this
one place which was shaken. 2. Giving and not granting that they were all
conveened to prayer, it does not follow that they did meet ordinarily in one
place, for partaking of Word and Sacraments, as one Congregation, for ^oe might
conveene to prayer and hearing the Word, then could meet ordinarily in a
Congregationall-way. Neither will any Text enforce us to expone (...),
collectively, but distributively, as we say, all the Congregations in Scotland
met, (...), in one, every Lords day, that is, every one of the Congregations is
in one place, but the sense is not that all the Congregations collectively are
in one place. And we may justly ask what this place was which was shaken, it
is not like that it was the Temple, that which should have been more
prodigious like, and presaged a ruin to the Temple, would not have been
concealo^ by the holy Ghost, for it would have more terrified the Jews, and
the Temple is never called (...) sine adjecto, without some other thing to make
it be known to be the holy place, if it was a private house, give us leave
to say it could not contain five thousand to hear prayer, far less a more
numerous multitude.

We re^it it to the judgment of the wise, if the Apostles were so lazy to
propagate the Gospel, that where twelve of them were present undoubtedly, Act.
4. 23 31. Act. 6. 2. and (as many of the learned think, the seventie
Disciples) that eleven Apostles did hear the Word only, and one did speak to
one Congregation only, which consisted of so many thousands, for to the five
thousand, if there were no more, c. 5. 14. mere believers were added to the
Lord, multitudes both of men and women, who could not conveniently hear? This
I think not imaginable; for 1. now the harvest was large, thousands were to
be converted. 2. The Spirit was now powered upon all flesh. 3. Christ, when he
sent the tw^lve but to Jude^, he sent them two and two, and would have every
man at work, and the Apostles went out in twoes, Act. 13. Paul and B^rna^as
and sometimes but one Peter was sent to the Jews, Paul to the Gentiles, and
the world divided amongst them, 1. of other officers Timothy is sent to
Ephesus, Titus to Crete, that so they might the more swiftly spread the Gospel
to all the world. What wisdom could we imagine would lead the twelve
Apostles to speak to one single Congregation met in one place, at one time?
the rest, to wit the eleven and the seventic Disciples being silent? for in the
Church the God of order will have one to speak at once, 1 Cor. 14. 31.

But our reverend brethren seeing and considering well that the Church at
Jerusalem could not all meet in one Congregationall way, and that they were a
Christian Church, and so behoo^ed to be a Presbyteriall Church, they do
therefore betake themselves to another Answer, for they say that this Church at
(...) an extraordinary constituted Church, and 1. wanted an Eldership, and
presbytery, as Christian Churches have now: 2. the government was merely
Apostolical: 3. the constitution was somewhat Jewish, rather then Christian,
for their service was mixed with legal ordinances and Jewish observances for
many years, and therefore cannot be a pattern of the Christian visible
Church which we now seek.

To which I answer. 1. Because our brethren consider that the Church of
Jerusalem will not be their independent Congregation, before we obtain it,
for us, as a mould of a presb^t^riall Church, they had rather quit their part
of it, and permit the Jews to have it, for us both, but we are content that
their Congregations in some good sense be given to them, and not to Jews. 2.
There is no reason, but the Church of Jerusalem be a Christian Church; 1. The
external profession of a visible Church makes it a visible Christian Church,
but this Church professes faith in Christ already come in the flesh and the
Sacraments of the New Testament, baptism, and the Sacramental breaking of
bread, Act. 22. 41, 42. we desire to know how saving faith in a multitude
constituteh an invisible Church, and the external and blameless profession of
that same saving faith does not contitute a visible Church also? and how this
is not a Christian visible Church not differing in essence and nature from the
(...) Churches that now are, to which the essential note of a visible Church
agrees, to wit the preaching or profession of the sound faith: if it be
called an Apostolic and so an extraordinary Christian Church because the
Apostles does govern ^it, that is not enough, if the Apostles govern it,
according to the rule of the word framing the visible Churches of the New
Testament, this way the Church of Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. shall be an Apostolic
and so an extraordinary Church, which our brethren cannot say. But we desire
to know wherein the frame of this first pattern Christian Church at Jerusalem
is so extraordinary, that it cannot be a rule to us to draw the mould of our
Churches according to it, for if the Apostles make it a pattern of an ordinary
Christian Church in Word and Sacraments, to say it was extraordinary in the
government, except you show that that government was different from the rule
that now is in government, is petitio principii, to beg what is in question,
for these same keys both of knowledge and jurisdiction that by your grant,
were given to the Church, Matthew. 18. 15, 16, 17. were given to the Apostles,
Matthew. 16, 17, 18. and Joh. 20. 21. If you say it is extraordinary, because as
yet they had not Deacons, for the Apostles did as yet serve tables, where as
afterward Act. 6. that was given to the Deacons by office, and so they had not
Elders, nor Doctors, nor Pastors as we now have, but the Apostles were both
Pastors, Ruling Elders, Doctors, and Deacons, and they were the only governing
Eldership, and this was extraordinary that they had no Eldership, and so they
were for that same cause no presbyteriall Church, whence it follows that you
cannot make this Church which had no presbytery, a pattern of a presbyteriall
Church.

But I answer, this will not take off the argument, if we shall prove that
after they were more then could meet in one Congregation, and so after they
were so numerous that they were more Congregations then one, they had one common
government, and 1. we say though the Apostles had power to govern all the
Churches of the world, and so many Congregations, yet if they did rule many
Congregations as Elders, and not as Apostles, we prove our point. Now we say
where baptism and the Lords Supper was, there behoved to be some government,
else the Apostles admitted promiscuously to baptism and the Lords Supper any
the most scandalous and profane, which we cannot think of the Apostles: it
is true say you, they admitted not all, but according to the rule of right
government, but this right government was extraordinary, in that it was not in
a settled Eldership of a Congregation, which was obliged to reside and
personally to watch over that determinate flock, and no other flock, but it was
in the hands of the Apostles, who might go through all the world to preach the
Gospel, and were not tied to any particular flock: and so from this neither
can you draw your classical Eldership, nor we our Congregationall Eldership.

But I answer, yet the question is begged, for though it be unlawful for a
settled Eldership not to reside where their charge is, yet the question is now
of a government in the hands of those who are obliged to reside and give
personal attendance to the flock, and the government in the hands of the
Apostles, who were not obliged to personal attendance over this and this
particular flock, which they did govern; were governments so different in
nature, as the one is a pattern to us, not the other, and the one follows
rules different in nature and spirit from the other; for though it were granted
that the Apostles did govern many Congregations as Apostles, not as Elders,
yet there was no extraordinary reason why these many Congregations should be
called one Church, and the believers added to them, said to be added to the
Church, as it is said, Act. 2. 47. And the Lord added to the Church daily such
as should be saved, except this Church be one entire body governed and ruled
according to Christ's Laws. 2. There be seven Descons chosen to this Church,
Act. 6. and Deacons are officers of the Church of Philippi which our brethren
calls Phil. 1. 1. a Congregationall Church, and Pnebe was a Deaconisse (say
they) of the Church of Cenchrea, Romans 16. 1. and if they had Deacons, they
could not want Elders, who are as necessary. 3. This Church could not be so
extraordinary as that it cannot be a pattern to us of the constant government
of Churches by Elders, which we call Aristocraticall, seeing it is brought as
a pattern of the Churches government by the voices of the people, which is
called by Divines, in some respect, democraticall, and this place is alleged
by our brethren, and by all Protestant Divines against Bishops and Papists to
prove that the people have some hand in government, to wit, in election of
officers, and so the words are clear, Act. 6. 5. And this saying pleased the
whole multitude, and they choosed Steven, etc. so this multitude did not make
one Congregationall Church, but it was a company of the multiplied disciples,
both of Grecians and Hebrews, as is clearly related to these spoken of, v. 1.
c. 6. Now Hebrews and Grccians were directly one Church having one government,
and seven Deacons, common to both, now that could not be a single independent
Congregation, as is already proved. 4. If the con^titution of this Church at
Jerusalem be sewish, because of some Jewish observations, and so no pattern
of the frame of ordinary visible Churches Christian; I say 1. this is no good
argument, seeing the Christian visible Church, and the Jewish visible Church is
of that same frame and constitution, having that same faith, s^all grant,
except Papists, Socinians and Armini^ns, and so that same profession of that
same faith. 2. If this were a good reason, then all the Churches of the
Gentiles which are commanded for a time, in the case of scandal, to observe
some Jewish Laws, to abstain from eating meats offered to Id^ls, and from
blood, and from things strangled, Act. 15. 29. Act. 16. 4. shall be also
Churches in their constitution Jewish, and so no pattern to us; and the Church
of Rome and of Corinth shall be Jewish also, and no pattern to us, because in
case of scandal they are to abstain from meats forbidden in the Law of Moses,
Romans 14. 1 Cor. 8. c. 10. but this our brethren cannot teach. 5. Though
Apostles did govern all these Congregations, yet we are not to thinke^ that
seeing there were such abundance of gifted men in this Church, on which the
Spirit, according to Joels prophecy, was powered in so large a measure, that
they did not appoint Elders who did personally watch over the converted flock,
especially seeing Apostles use never this Apostolical and extraordinary power,
but in case of necessity, where ordinary helps are wanting, else this answer
might clude all reasons drawn from the first molded Churches which were
planted by the Apostles and watered by their helpers. But I have heard some
say, that multitude of Pastors at Jerusalem does not prove that the Apostles
were idle, if they did all attend me Congregation, because they had work
enough in the Synagogues (...) convert the unconverted Jews, all the twelve
did not labor in preaching to the one single new converted Congregation.

Answ. But if you lay down our brethrens supposition, that the Apostles had no
public meetings for the Word and Sacraments of the Christian Church, but the
Temple, and that they ceased not daily in the Temple, and from house to house
to teach and preach Christ, as is said, Act. 5. 42. then consider that they
preached not daily in the Synagogues, but in the Temple and i^ houses, and
their first conquest of five thousand was above three Congregations, beside
those who daily came In: and c^r^ainly it the first was but one Congregation,
yet one of the twelve preached to that Congregation, the other eleven b^hoor^d
to have a Congregation also. 6. Our brethren acknowledge the Church of
Jerusalem to be one Church, for it is called, even before the dispersion, one
Church in the singular number, Act. 2. 47. And the Lord added to the Church
daily. (...) as should be saved, Act. 5. 11. Great fear came upon all the
Church, and Act. 8 1. A^ that time there was a great persecution (...) Church.
2. They grant before the disportion that it had a government, but they deny
this government to be presbyterial, thy s^y it was Apostolic and
extraordinary, and that it had not in Eldership, nor read we of any Elders
till after the dispersion, Act. 8 1. When their number was diminished, so as it
is clear they (...) meet in one Congregation. 3. You must prove this
government be one if you prove a Presbyteriall Church at Jerusalem. 4. (...)
must prove diverse formed and organicall and several Con^^^nions at Jerusalem,
if you prove such presbyteriall Churches as (...) have in Scotland; but I pray
you, The Apostles (you say) (...) the Church of Jerusalem as Apostles, and so
as extraordinary Elders, not as an ordinary Eldership and Presbytery, but give
me leave to say this is a mere shift. 1. What reason to call the Apostles
governing of the Church extraordinary, more then their preaching the Word and
their administration of the Sacraments is extraordinary? and if Word and
Sacraments do prove that this was the first visible Church and a type and
pattern to all visible Churches, why should its government be extraordinary?
2. Why should the government be extraordinary, because the Apostles did
govern it, in respect they were extraordinary officers, and should not the
government be by the Apostles; and exercised by them as a common ordinary
presbytery, seeing this Church in its goods, was governed by seven ordinary and
constant Chu^ch-officers, the seven Deacons? Act. 6. and seeing the people did
exercise an act of ordination (say our brethren) but an act of popular election
(say we) which cannot be denynyed to be a politic act of diverse Churches,
Hebrews and Grecians choosing their own ordinary officers in relation to
which they made one governed Church, under one common government, which is not
congregationall; because not of one Congregation, but of more Congregations
conveened in their principal members (for they could not all meet in one, as
we have proved) Ergo, it must be presbyteriall. And that this government is
one to me is evident, because these seven Deacons were officers in ordinary to
them all. 3. We see not how we need to prove that the several Congregations
were several formed, fixed and organicall bodies; 1. Because it shall be hard
to our brethren to prove a Parishionall Church in its local circuit in the
Apostolic Church, and when Churches were molded and framed first in local
circuits of parishes, I will not undertake to determine. 2. Ten Congregations
in a great City, though not molded locally and formally in ten little
distinct Churches organicall, yet if sixteen or twenty Elders in common feed
them all, with Word, Seals and common government, they differ not in nature
from ten formed and fixed Congregations, and the government is as truly
Aristocraticall, and presbyteriall, as if every one of them had their own
fixed Eldership out of these sixteen Elders, for fixing of this or this Elder
to this or this Congregation is but accidental to the nature of an organicall
Church; if ten little Cities have ten magistrates who rules them all in
common, they are ten perfect political incorporations and societies, no less
then if to every one of these ten were a fixed magistrate, to this or this
city; Because the King and State might accuse them all for any misgovernment
or act of unjustice done by the whole ten conveened in one judicature to judge
themall; for what unjustice is done by the major part is to be imputed to the
whole college, in so far as the whole college has hand in it. 2. The
formal acts of a political Congregation not fixed are one and the same in
nature and essence with the formal Church-acts of a fixed Congregation; For 1.
the Word and Sacraments are one and the same: 2. their acts of government, in
rebuking, accusing, and joint consenting to deliver to Satan an incestuous man
are one and the same, whether the Congregation be fixed, or not fixed; show us
a difference.

But it is said, they are different in a political or in a
Churchconsideration, 1. Because this determinate Congregation is to subject
their consciences in the Lord, to this fixed Eldership whom they have called
and chosen to be their Elders, and not to the ministry of any others, as 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. Know them that labor amongst you, (...), (not those who are over
others,) and that are over you, (...), and are over you in the Lord, not over
others, (...) and adm^nish you, not others: and 2. The Pastors are to feed such
a flock over which the holy Ghost has set them, Acts 20. 28. and they are to
feed the flock amongst them, 1 Pet. 5. 2. not any other, (...), therefore
Pastors are fixed by the holy Ghost to a fixed congregation. 3. Pastors are not
rebuked by the Spirit of God, for remiss exercise of jurisdiction and
Church Power, but over their own fixed Congregation, not because they do not
exercise their power over other Congregations over which they are not, and for
whose souls they do not watch, as is evident in the several rebukes tendered
by Christ to every Angel or Eldership of the seven Churches in Asia, Revel. 2.
c. 3. where every Angel and Church is rebuked for their own omissions toward
their own fixed and particular flocks.

Answ. The places do not come up, to prove fixed Congregations in the Apostles
times; for 1. we deny that the Church of Thessalonica was one single fixed
Congregation, or the Church of Ephesus either, and far less can the Churches
of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bythinia, to which Peter writes, and
whose Elders, 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. he exhorts to feed the flock of God, be one
fixed Congregation, nor do they prove that fixed Congregations were, though I
think it not unprobable that when Phebe, Romans 16. 1. is called a Deac^nisse of
the Church, which is at Cenchrea, that there were fixed Congregations at that
time, but many things not without apparent strength of much probability may
be said by the learned, on the contrary. 2. The Eldership of Ephesus I dare
not call the Eldership of one Congregation, far less of one fixed
Congregation, and they are all commanded to feed the flock over which the holy
Ghost had set them, and no other Church that is most true. But how do our
brethren infer a fixed Congregation at Ephesus from thence? far less I
think can they in far that the formal Church-acts of a fixed, and a not
fixed Congregation are different in nature; and therefore, if we can show that
in the Apostolic Churches they had many Congregations though not fixed, under
one common Eldership, which did feed them in common with Word, Sacraments and
Discipline, as is clearly proved, then have we a pattern of a Presbyteriall
Church. 3. The Elders of Ephesus and these Elders, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. had all
of them a burden of the souls amongst them, and over which the holy Ghost had
set them, and they had not a burden and charge in particular of others as
watching in particular for the souls of others: but how fixed Congregations
are hence inferred I see not, for I may have with other six Pastors, a
Pastoral burden and charge to watch for three Congregations, according to my
talent and strength, though I be not a fixed pastor to all the three
collectively, or to any fixed one distributively, so as all the omissions of my
six fellow-labourors shall be laid to my charge, in the Court of the Judge and
Lord of all, if I do what I am able: which I demonstrate thus. 1. That moral
obligation of conscience which did obliege the Apostles as Pastors of the
Christian world which was to be converted, is not temporary but perpetual and
moral and did obliege the Apostles as Christians. Therefore this moral,
obligation did lie upon the Apostles to feed the Catholic fiocke of the whole
Christian world over which the holy Ghost had set them, just as the Elders of
Ephesus, Act. 20. 28. are commanded to feed the whole flock of God which is at
Ephesus: now I ask if every single Apostle is to make a reckoning to God for
the souls of all the Christian world? 2. If Peter must be answerable to God,
because Paul by negligence should incur the woe of not preaching the Gospel,
1 Cor. 9. 16? (3.) If upon this moral ground of an obligation lying on the
Apostles to feed the Catholic flock of the whole world, amongst which they
were, for the most part, by special commandment of Christ, to preach to all
nations, Matthew. 28. 19. to every creature, Mark. 16. v. 15. If (I say) the
Apostles be tied to plant Churches in such determinate quarters and fixed
kingdoms of the habitable world, and if the dividing of the world into twelve
several parts, and large parishes to the twelve Apostles, be juris divini, of
divine institution? I believe this can hardly be proved by Gods Word. 2. Where
there be six Elders in a Congregation supposed to be independent, every one
of the six are obliged in their place to feed the whole flock, over which the
holy Ghost has set them, and that by the commandment of God, Act. 20. 28. 29.
1 Pet. 5. 1. as our brethren teach, but I hope by these places no humane logic
would infer, nor could our brethren collect, that, 1. every one of these six
should, by divine institution, be set over each of them the sixth determinate
and sixth part of that Congregation. 2. That every one of the sixth were not to
give a reckoning for the whole Congregation, and did not watch for the whole
Congregation according to his Talent. 3. That one might not be accused, even
one Archippus possibly at Colosse, Col. 4. 17* for his own particular neglect
to the whole flock, though others were also joined with Archippus who fulfilled
their part of their ministry, Col. 2. v. 5. yea and we justly ask if all the
Elders of Thyatira were guilty of remiss discipline against the false
Prophetess Jezabell, and if all the Church of Sardis did become sleepie, and
secure, and had a name that they were living, and yet were dead, though the
Eldership under the name of the Angel of the Church, be indefinitely rebuked,
Revel. 2. 20. c. 3. 1, 2, 3. 4. yea it is like to me that seeing the Lord
Jesus commends the one for love, service, faith, patience, Revel. 2. 19. and
the other, that c. 3. 4 they had a few names that had not defiled their
garments, that only those who were guilty, were rebuked, I believe, and
therefore this is to be proved that Elders are not rebuked, but for their
remiss watching over an unfixed Congregation, the places to me, do not prove
it.

Now whereas our brethren say, that they read of no Eldership before the
dispersion of the Church at Jerusalem, Act. 8. 1. and therefore of no
presbyteriall government, and after the dispersion, the number was so
diminished as they might all meet in one Congregation, because it is said, Act.
8. 1. They were all scattered abroad through^^^ the regions of Judea and
Samaria except the Apostles. It is easily answered.

1. To what effect should the twelve Apostles not also have followed their
scattered flocks, and to what end did twelve Apostles stay at Jerusalem to
preach to one single handful, that might all conveniently meet in one house,
and a private house, for I think the persecution could as easily put them from
public meetings in the Temple and Synagogues, as it could scatter them all to
so few a number as one congregation? was the the harvest so great, and the
Apostolic laborers so sparing in reaping, as eleven should be hearers in one
Congregation? and one speak only at once?

2. Our brethren may know that we prove a Presbyterlall government before the
dispersion. 3. If our brethren elide the force of our argument from multitude
of believers at Jerusalem, to prove a presbyteriall Church, they must prove
that this dispersion did so dissolve the Church as that three thousand, Act. 2.
and some added daily, v. 47. and five thousand, Act. 4. 4. and believers more
added, multitudes both of men and women, Act. 5. 14. and Jerusalem was filled
with the doctrine of the Apostles, c. 5. 28. and yet the number of the
Disciples multiplied, c. 6. 1. and the Word of God increased, and the number of
the Disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the
Priests were obedient to the faith, they must (I say) prove (for affirmanti
incumbit probatio) that all this number and all these thousands by the
dispersion, Act. 8. 1. came to one thousand and to a handful of a single
Congregation.

3. I see no necessity that these (all) be the whole body of the Church, I
grant Diod^tus says so, and Ba^on. An. 1.
Baronius conjectureth that there were fifteen thousand killed at this first
persecution, Dorotheus l de vit. and mor. prophet. and Apostol.
but Dorotheus says there were but two thousand killed, and (c) Salmeron says
of Dorotheus his relation, Quae si vera sunt, profecta magna fuit persecutio,
if it be true, the persecution was indeed great, and we cannot but think,
seeing the spirit of God says (b) Salme ron, com. in Ac. 8.
this was a great persecution, but the Church was greatly diminished: but let
us see if the Text will bear that so many thousands (for I judge at this time
that the Church has been above ten thousands) were partly killed, partly
scattered, so that the Church of Jerusalem came to one single Congregation
which might meet ordinarily for Word and Sacran^ents in one private house,
where the tewelve Apostles came to them: for my part I cannot see it in the
Text, only the persecution was great. 2. All were scattered except the
Apostles. 3. Act. 26. Paul says of himself at this time, 10. Many of the
Saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the high
Priests, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. 11. And
I punished them often in every Synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme, and
being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them to strange Cities; all
which says many were imprisoned. 2. Some scattered, but the Text says not
that thousands were put to death, and it is not like that the holy Ghost who
sets down the other sort of persecution and the death of Steven, would have
been silent of the killing of thousands. 3. Whereas it is said, they were all
scattered except the Apostles, I see no ground of the Text to say that by
((...)) all scattered, he understands, all the Disciples as Lyran. an. in
loc.
Lyranus says, so says Eus^bius l. 2 histo. Eccle. c 1.
Eusebius, though Sanctius com ib.
Sanctius says he means of the 70. Disciples. And my reasons are, 1. The
Text says, v. 3. Saul entering into every house, ^aling men and women
committed them to prison, as you may read, Act. 26. 10, 11. Ergo, all and every
one without exception of any, save the Apostles, were not scattered. 2. Amongst
so many thousands of men and women, many for age, weakness and sickness, and
having young Answ to q. 29. and 2.
children, and women with child were not able to flee, therefore ((...)) cannot
be taken according to the letter every way. 3. Paul after this dispersion,
Act. 26. 11. punished them in every Synagogne. What? punished he Jews? no
Christians; Ergo, after the dispersion there were Christians left in Synagogues
at Jerusalem which were not dispersed. 4. The Text says that the scattered
abroad were Preachers, and as I prove elsewhere here after, extraordinary
Prophets, and therefore all were scattered except the Apostles, seems to
imply that especially the whole teachers were scattered, except the Apostles;
and Chrysostom. in lcc.
Chrysostom, Athanasi. ^ Sermon. de sem.
Athanasius, Nyssenus or at de S. Stephano.
Nissenus observes that God out of this persecution took occasion to spread
the Gospel, by sending scattered Preachers to all the regions about, so
Lorinus in certum an omnino omnes (dispersi) an soli antiquores discipuli.
Lorinus, Sanctius ib.
Sanctius, Cor. a Lapide, ib.
Cornelius a Lapide, say they were not all sattered, and Cajeta. in lo.
Cajetan exponeth these (all) only of those upon whom the holy Ghost
descended. 4. Though this Church should come to one Congregation now, this is
but by accident, and from extrinsecall causes of persecution and scattering,
but we have proved at the first founding of this Church Apostolic the Church
of Jerusalem called one Church, the first draught and pattern of the visible
Christian Church was such as could contain many Congregations, and could not
all meet in one. 5. There is no ground to say that Apostles after this
dispersion erected an ordinary Eldership in Jerusalem, whereas before there was
an extraordinary, because the Apostles was present with them, and you read of
no Elders while after the dispersion, because 1. you read not of the
institution of ordinary Elders in the Church of Jerusalem after the
dispersion, more then before, and so you are here upon conjectures. 2. There is
no ground to say that the Apostles changed the government of the first pattern
of the Christian Churches from extraordinary to ordinary. 3. Nor is there
ground that the government of the first samplar of Instituted Churches of the
New Testament, should rather be extraordinary, then that first ordering of
the Word and Sacraments should be extraordinary, seeing the Apostles the first
founders of instituted Churches under the New Testament, had as ordinary matter
to institute an ordinary presbytery and government, having believers in such
abundance, upon whom, by the laying on of hands, they might give the Holy
Ghost, as they had ordinary matter, to wit, a warrant, and command from Christ,
to preach and administer the Sacraments. 4. The Apostles abode many years at
Jerusalem, after there was an erected Eldership, Act. 15. 2. 22. Act. 16. 4.
Act. 21. 18, 19, 20. Gal. 1. 18 After three years I went up to Jerusalem to
see Peter, Gal. 2. 1. Then foureture years after, I went up again to
Jerusalem, etc. 9. And when James, Cephas, and John who seemed to be pillars,
perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the
right hands fellowship. 5. Though we should give, and not grant that this
dispersion did bring the Church of Jerusalem to so low an ebb as to make it
but one single Congregation, yet after the dispersion, all the Churches, Act.
9. 3. had peace, and were edified, and multiplied, and so the Church of
Jerusalem also was multiplied, if all France be multiplied, Paris which is a
part of France must be multiplied, and if there were many thousands of the
Jews that did believe, Act. 21. 20. though these many were for a great part
come up to the feast at Pentecost, as some think, yet may we well think a
huge number of these thousands were of the Church of Jerusalem: it is said, v.
21. They are informed of thee that thou teach all the Jews which are
amongst the Gentiles to forsak Moses, these belike were the Jews at Jerusalem
who heard that Paul was come to Jerusalem, and Act. 12. 24. The Word of God
grew and multiplied; it is the same phrase that is used, Act. 6. v. 7. to
express the multiplying of the Church, by the multiplying of the Word, for
there is no other multiplication of the Word but in the hearts of numbers who
receive the Word in faith.

Our brethren object; 1. Though there be Elders at Jerusalem, Act. 15. 2. v.
4. and Act. 21. 18. yet that does not prove an Eldership o^ a formal
presbytery, even a presbytery of a classical Church does not prove that these
Classical Elders are Elders of a Classical Church.

Answ. Our brethren should give to us the measure which they take to
themselves, for they prove from that which the Scripture, Act. 20. 28. do name
the Elders of the Church of Ephesus that there was an Eldership at Ephesus,
which governed all the people of Ephesus; and from Bishops and Deacons at
Philippi, Phil. 1. 1. that there was an Eldership in that Church; and from the
Angel of the Church of Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyrtira, etc. that there was a
college of Elders or a Presbytery in those Churches: for if those Churches had
elders in them, though they were in their meaning Elders of a particular
Congregation, and so an Eldership and a presbytery, they must give us the
favor of the like consequence, in many of those Churches, they had Elders;
Ergo, they had a presbyteriall or classical Eldership, and the word (...) is
as seldom in Scripture to our brethren to prove their Congregationall
Eldership, as it is to us to prove our Presbyteriall or classical Eldership,
and in this, jam sumns ergo pares; and one government, and combination
voluntary under one Congregationall presbytery shall be as hardly proven, as
one government, and one voluntary combination of many Congregations, and where
the multitude is so numerous, as that they cannot meet in one, it is unpossible
to prove that so many thousands did all agree, and that according to Christ's
institution, to meet ordinarily in one for doctrine and discipline, whereas the
meeting in one of so many thousands is most inconvenient. 2. An Eldership does
prove there is a relation of those that make up the Eldership to all the Church
distributively to which they have the relation of Elders, but does not prove
that the Eldership is an Eldership in a Church-relation to any one single
person, and that that single person has a reciprocal Church relation to that
Eldership; so here the classical Eldership carries a relation to a classical
Church, and a classical Church does retort and reflect a reciprocal relation
to the Eldership, but it does not follow that every Congregation of the
Classical Church does reflect a reciprocal relation of a Church classical to
either the classical Eldership, or to any one Elder of the classical
presbytery.

2. They affirm, that there was no presbyteriall government exercised by the
Apostles in the Church of Jerusalem; for they say, for the substance of the Act
(it is true) The Apostles did govern as Elders, that is, their Acts of
government were not different from the Acts of government of ordinary Elders:
but the Apostles did not govern under this formal reduplication as ordinary
Elders, but as Apostles, because as Apostles they were Elders both in the
Church of Jerusalem, and in all Churches of the world: but this proves not an
ordinary Eldership, Titus at Crete did but the ordinary Acts of an ordinary
Elder at Crete in appointing Elders in every city, yet this proves not that
there is in the successors of Titus an ordinary Episcopal government, for
because of the extent of the Apostles power to all Churches on earth, you may
from this prove as well an Episcopal power as a presbyteriall power in an
Eldership over many Congregations; and before you prove a presbyteriall power
you must prove an extent and an ordinary extent of an Eldership over many
Congregations, which you shall never prove from the extent of the Apostles
power, which was universal and alike in all Churches.

I answer, if our brethren had formed their arguments in a syllogism, I could
more easily have answered, but I will do it for them. Those who did rule with
an universal extent of power of government in all Churches, these did rule as
Apostolic rulers, and not as ordinary presbyters, in the ruling and governing
the Church of Jerusalem: but the Apostles before the dispersion did rule thus,
Ergo, the Apostles before the dispersion did rule as Apostles, not as ordinary
presbyters. The proposition they make good, because if those who rule with an
universal extent of power, do it not as Apostles, they have then prelates to
succeed them as ordinary officers in their extent of power and extent of
pastoral care over many Churches.

But I answer by granting the major, and the probation of it in the connex
proposition, because those who rule with an universal extent of power do it
as Apostles, but I deny the assumption that the twelve Apostles did rule the
Church of Jerusalem with an universal extent of power over all Churches; for
it is true, the Apostles who did govern the Church of Jerusalem had an
universal power over all Churches, but that they did rule the Church of
Jerusalem as having this universal power, and by virtue of this universal and
Apostolical power, I utterly deny, and I deny it with the reduplication, and
except our brethren prove that the Apostles did govern the Church of Jerusalem
as having this Apostolic power, and under this reduplication, they do not
prove that they ruled as Apostles, which is the conclusion to be proven. Now
that I may give a solid reason of this, we are to consider, what Apostles do
as Apostles and what as ordinary Elders, as take along this rule with you, what
Apostles do as Apostles; every one of the Apostles his alone may do, as quod
convenit (...), conv^nit (...), What ever agrees to an Apostle as ^^ Apostle,
agrees to all Apostles, as because Apostles may work miracles, any one
Apostle may work a miracle, so Peter his alone, extra collegium, when he is
not with the twelve, he may work a miracle, his alone he may speak with
tongues, and his alone he may preach and baptize through all the world, and
therefore Peter as an Apostle, not as an ordinary Elder does raise the dead,
speak with tongues, preach and baptize in all nations without any calling of
the people or without consent of the presbytery; but what the Apostles do as
ordinary presbyters, and as a classical College that by cannot do in that
relation, but in collegie: as the eye does not see but as fixed in the head, so
when the Apostles do any thing in collegio, not without the suffrages of a
college, that they must do as ordinary Elders; for example, Paul if he
delivered Hymeneus and Alexander his alone to Satan, 1 Timothy 1. 20. as many
think he did, then he did that as an Apostle; but suppose he had been
present at Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. to obey his own Epistle and direction that he
gave to excommunicate the incestuous man, he should with the Eldership of
Corinth delivered him to Satan as an Elder, not as an Apostle; yea in a
presbyteriall way Paul could not have delivered him to Satan without the
concurring joint suffrages of the Eldership of Corinth. So because Act. 6. 1.
2. 3. the whole twelve do call together the multitude, the whole twelve do
that as ordinary Elders, which I prove, for if they had conveened them as
Apostles, by that transcendent Apostolic power by which they preach and
baptize in all the Churches and by which they raise the dead, Peter his alone
might have conveened them; so they ordain Elders by imposition of hands, as an
ordinary Eldership now does, all the twelve do it in a Court, whereas if they
had put on these seven men to be Deacons upon the people by virtue of their
Apostolic calling, they should not have convened the people, nor sought the
free consent of the people; for any one Apostle his alone, as Peter might, by
the transcendent power of an Apostle have ordained those seven men to be
Deacons, but then he should clearly have done it not in an ordinary Church
way, so now the Apostles must, Act. 6. govern as ordinary Elders, also what
the Apostles do by the interveening help of ordinary perpetually established
means, that they do not as Apostles but as ordinary Elders, as they work not
miracles by advise and consent of the multitude, because they do it as
Apostles, but here the twelve do all by the interveening help of the ordinary
and perpetually established free voices of the multitude. 1. Because the twelve
Apostles conveene. The Apostles did nothing in vain, and without warrant, any
one of the twelve might have instituted the office, then that all the twelve
conveene it must be to give a pattern of an ordinary Eldership; for you never
find all the twelve meet to do with joint Forces an Apostolic work, they
never met all twelve to pen a portion of Scripture, twelve of them, nor a
college of them never met to raise the dead, to work a miracle, to speak
with tongues, because these be works above nature, and one is no less an
instrument of omnipotency to work a miracle, then 12. or 20. therefore we
must say that these twelve conveened as ordinary Elders to be a pattern of a
presbytery. 2. The complaint is made by the Grecians to the court, not to one
Apostle, for the whole twelve does r^dresse the matter. 3. Tht college has a
common hand in this government for the poor, as their words clear. 2. It is
no reason that we should leave the Word of God, and serve Tables. 4. They put
on the people what is their due, to look out and nominate to them seven men,
as Apostles they should have chosen the men. 5. They do put off themselves the
charge of Deaconrie, and the daily care, as v. 1. Ergo they were before daily
constant Deacons, and why not Elders also? 6. They will do nothing with out
the free voices of people, and give to the people the ordinary election, this
day, and to Christ's second coming, due to them, Ergo, the Apostles stoop
beneath the sphere of Apostolic power and condescend to popular power, and so
must here be as ordinary Elders, not as Apostles. 7. They do ordain seven
men to be constant officers. 2. From this it is easy to deny that we may as
well infer Prelates to be the lawful successors of T^us whose power was
universal in every Church of Crete, as to in^erre a presbyteriall power,
because Titus his alone (...) an (...) appointed Elders; and we cannot infer
a Monarchi^ in the Church, from some extraordinary acts of the the first
planters of Churches, because we infer from the Aristocraticall and ordinary
power of the Apostles an Aristocraticall power of presbyteries now in the
Church, shall we hence infer a Monarchy? 3. If the Acts of government
performed here, Act. 6. by the Apostles, be extraordinary and Apostolic, they
are not imitable by us, but all Divines teach that from Act. 6. the ordinary
presbytery may according to this very pattern ordain Deacons and Elders.

The reverend brethren object. The Apostles did ordain a new office here, to
wit, an office of Deacons, as all our Divi^^s prove from the place, but the
Apostles as ordinary Elders in an ordinary College presbyteriall cannot
appoint a new Office in the Church, for the presbyteries now also by that same
presbyteriall power might also appoint a new office in Gods house which is
absurd.

Answ. I grant that the Apostles as Apostles perform some Acts of government
in this place, and that they appoint a new office of Deacons here, but that is
neither the question, nor against our cause, but I desire the opponents to make
good that the Apostles did appoint this new office in a Church Way, as they
ordain these seven men to the office, and that, in collegio. I ask did the
Apostles, 1. Crave the concurrence of the conveened multitude, and their free
voices shall we appoint this new office, men and brethren, or shall we for
bear? 2. Did they voice the matter in a college amongst themselves, as they
do Act. 15. and do they say amongst themselves in the presbytery Apostolic,
have we warrant from Christ to appoint a new office of Deacons? What is your
mind Peter, what is your sentence, James, Matthias, etc? now this is to proceed
formally, in collegio, this they did not, nor could they do in appointing the
office, for they were immediately inspired by the Spirit to appoint new offices,
but in ordaining the officers, in concreto, that is, in ordaining the men,
Steven, Philip, etc. they proceed after a presbyteriall way, every way as an
ordinary presbytery does.

Object. But they ordain Elders here upon this Apostolic ^round, because they
were Apostles and Pastors to all the world, etc. if the ground was Apostolic,
the action was formally Apostolic.
Answ. We must distinguish betwixt ordination comparative and absolute:
ordination comparative is in relation to the place, if the question be, upon
what ground do the Apostles ordain in all the world; I answer because they
are Apostles, and every where, Ergo, they may ordain every where; but as for
absolute ordination, here in Jerusalem, if the question bewhy they did ordain
Stephen, Philip, etc. tali modo, by conveening the Church; I answer, because
the Apostles were Elders. But our brethren say, Then the Apostles in this act
laid down their infallible Apostolic spirit. I answer, they laid down the
ininfallible spirit, which they had as Apostles, and took them to ^ fallible
spirit, but they did not operate and govern in this Act, from this infallible
spirit, but from an ordinary spirit, else you must say, 1. when the Apostles
did eat and drink, they laid down an infallible and Apostolic spirit, and
took an ordinary and fallible spirit, for they did not eat and drink by
immediate inspiration and as Apostles, but as men; 2. because they were
Apostles where ever they came, it shall follow by this that they did all by
this Apostolic spirit; as if the question be upon what ground, Did the
Apostles every where baptize, pray pasi^a^^y, exhort as Pastors, govern in
Corinth, deliver the incestuous man to Satan at Corinth? If you answer, because
they were Apostles, then I say because they were Apostles always, and in every
place, they never used the ordinary power of the keys given to them, as common
to them and all Pastors to the end of the world, Matthew. 18. 18. Matthew. 16. 19.
John 20. 23. and so they could not do any thing as ordinary Pastors, or
ordinary Elders. 2. Christ gave to the Apostles an ordinary power which they
could never put forth in Acts 3. we have no warrant from the Apostles
preaching, baptizing, exhorting, governing, retaining and remitting sins,
excommunicating, rebuking, to preach, baptize, exhort, govern, retain and
remit sins, excommunicate and rebuke, because the Apostles, in Acts
Apostolic and extraordinary, are no more to be imitated by us, then we are
to imitate them in speaking with diverse tongues, and raising the dead.

Hence upon these grounds we are certainly induced to believe that the
Apostles did here ordain, not as Apostles, but as ordinary Elders; 1. Because
in these Acts the Apostles are imitable, but in what they do as Apostles they
are not imitable.

2. What ever rules of the Word does regulate the ordinary classical
presbytery, the Apostles go along in all these acts here condescending to
these rules, such as the meeting of the presbytery, the twelve do meet. 2. They
tacitly acknowledge a neglect of the daily ministration to the widows which
is an act of misgovernment of the Deaconrie, which is an ordinary office of the
presbytery, and therefore they desire of the Church to be freed of this
office. 3. They refer the nomination and election of the seven men to the
people. 4. They ordain seven constant and perpetual officers, as the
presbytery does, Ergo, they do not ordain by their transcendent power, as
Apostles.

3. From this place our brethren prove their Congregationall presbytery, which
they would not do, if the Apostles did here manage aff^ires as extraordinary
officers. 4. This colle^ium of Apostles do nothing in all this, which by
confession of both sides may not be done, and to the end of the world is not
done in the transacting of the like business, by the ordinary presbytery. 4.
What the Apostles do as Apostles agrees only to Apostles, and can be done by
none but Apostles, or by Evangelists, having their power, by special
warrantable commission from them, as what a man does as a man, what a Pastor
does as a Pastor, a Deacon as a Deacon, a Prophet as a Prophet, can be done by
none but by a man only, a Pastor only, a Deacon only, except whereas one
Act, as to teach, agrees both to a Pastor and a Doctor, which yet have their
own differences, but all here done the Apostles might have done, if we
suppose, they had not been Apostles. 5. If as Apostles they ordain, any one
of the twelve Apostles should completely and entirely ordain all the seven,
and so the seven Deacons should have been twelve times ordained at this time,
which needles multiplication of Apostolic actions were useless, served not
for edification, and is not grounded in the Word, for the whole twelve, in
collegio, do ordain, and what any one Apostle does as an Apostle by the
amplitude of a transcendent power, every Apostle does it completely, and wholly
his alone, as without help of another Apostle, Peter works a miracle,
especially any one Apostle as Paul his alone might ordain Timothy an
Evangelist. 6. If they did here act as Apostles, any one Apostle might have
ordained the Deacons in an ordinary way, as here; but that we cannot conceive,
for then one and the same action should have been ordinary, and not ordinary,
for one man cannot be a Church or a society to do the ordinary Acts of an
ordinary society, for it should be extraordinary to one to act that which is
the formal Act of many as many, and should involve a contradiction, except it
were an Act which cannot be performed by many, as when one Paster speaks for
many, for a whole Church; but that is ordinary and necessary, because a
multitude as a multitude cannot speak, without confusion in a continuated
discourse, for that all the people say one word (Amen) is not a multitude as a
multitude using one continuated speech.

Object. 1. If the Apostles did not all their Ministerial acts as Apostles,
they did not fulfill their commission given to them, as to Apostles, Matthew. 28.
Go and teach all Nations.
Answ. The consequence is naught, if they had not done all things, which by
virtue of their Apostolical Office they were commanded to do, they had not
then fulfilled their commission given to them by Christ. That is true, but now
the assumption is false, they were under no commandment of Christ to do all
their Ministerial Acts as Apostles, prove that they did neither Preach, nor
Baptize as Apostles; but only as Apostles they did preach infallibly. 2. In all
places of the world, as Catholic Pastors. 3. With the gift of Tongues. 4.
Working of Miracles, which by divine institution were annexed to their
preaching, but their preaching according to the substance of the act was
ordinary.

Object. 2. The Apostles went to Jerusalem by revelation, as Paul did, Gal. 1.
Ergo, all their acts that they did there, they did them by immediate revelation.
Answ. The consequence is null, Paul went by revelation up to Jerusalem, and
there Gal. 2. he rebuked Peter, as an Apostle? no, as a Brother, for then Paul
should have exercised Apostolic Authority over Peter, which is popish.

Object. 3. If the Apostles did act as Presbyters here, they did wrong the
particular Churches, and took their Liberty from them, in exercising ordinary
Ministerial acts there, which are proper to that Church.
Answ. It follows upon the denied principles of an independent Congregation
only, for a Church without Elders has no Presbyteriall power, and therefore
such a power can not be taken from it, you cannot take from a Church, that
which by Law it has not. If the Acts of the government in the Apostles, are
according to the substance of the Acts all one with the Acts of government, in
the ordinary presbytery; Ergo, say I, those Acts come not from an Apostolical
and extraordinary power, even as the Apostles preaching and baptizing are not
different in nature and essence, from the Acts of preaching and baptizing in
ordinary Pastors, though they had power to preach and baptize every where, and
we only where we have an ordinary calling of the Church, and from the
Apostles preaching and baptizing every where, we may infer, it is lawful
for the ordinary Elders their successors to preach and baptize in some place,
why may we not infer because the Apostles, in collegio, in one presbytery did
ordain ordinary officers, that we have thence a pattern for an ordinary
presbytery?

Object. 4. If there were no institution for preaching and baptizing, but only
the Apostles naked practice, we were not warrantably to preach and baptize from
the sole and naked example of the Apostles.
Answ. Show us an institution for preaching and baptizing then, for that which
we allege is an institution, Matthew. 28. 19, 20. Mark. 14. v. 15. to you is a
commandment given to the Apostles as Apostles, as you said, in the 1.
objection proponed by you, and therefore we have no more warrant to preach and
baptize from the Apostles example, then we have to work miracles, and because
by the same reason of yours, Christ's command to his Apostles to preach before
his death, Matthew. 10. is not ordinary presbyteriall preaching, but conjoined
also with the power of casting out devils, Matthew. 10. 1, 2, 3. it must also
upon the same ground be a Commandment given to the Apostles not as ordinary
Pastors, but as Apostles, if we compare Matthew. 10. 1, 2, 3. with Mark. 16. 15,
16, 17, 18. If you flee to John Baptist his practice of baptism, 1. you are
farther off then you were; 2. What warrant more that John Baptist his practice
should warrant preaching and baptizing, if it want an institution, then the
Apostles preaching and baptizing when it is separated from an institution? 2.
This argument pincheth you as much as us, for a thousand times in your books,
a warrant for our ordinary Elders to preach and baptize is fetched from the
sole practice of the Apostles. 3. By this the argument for the Christian
Salbath, from the Apostles observing that day, shall also fall. 4. This also
shall make us loose in fundamentalls of Church government which are grounded
upon the Apostles practice. 5. The Apostles had no Apostolic and extraordinary
ground which moved them to preach and baptize, according to the substance of
the Acts, for they did preach and baptize upon these moral and perpetual
motives and grounds which do obliege ordinary Elders to preach and baptize
even to Christ's second coming, Ergo, their very practice, not considered with
the institution, is our pattern and rule.

It is as evident that there was a Presbyteriall Church at Jerusalem after the
dispersion, seeing the dispersion, as we have proved did not re^rench them to
one Congregation, because our Brethren do conclude from a company of Elders of
the Church of Ephesus, Acts 20. of Jerusalem, from the Angel of the Church of
pergamus, of Thyatira a formal ordinary Presbytery of Ephesus, of Jerusalem,
of Thyatira. Let us have the favor of the same argument, upon the supposall of
many Congregations which the word does warrant, and upon the supposall that it
is called one Church always, as Acts 2. 47. The Lord added to the Church, Acts
5. 11. fear came upon all the Church, Acts 8. 1. there arose a great
persecution against the Church, Acts 12. 1. Herod stretched forth his hand to
vex certain of the Church, v. 5. prayer was made without ceasing of the Church
unto God. Acts 15. 4. and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received
of the Church, and of the Apostles and Elders, Acts. 21. 15. Paul went up to
Jerusalem, and v. 18. The day following Paul went in with us, into James, and
all the Elders were present. Here be Elders of the Church of Jerusalem, and
Jerusalem is named one Church frequently, and always before and after the
dispersion; it is called a Church in the singular number, not only in relation
to persecuters, but also in relation to government, and because they were a
political society to which there were many added Acts 2. 47. and which has
Elders Acts 15. 4. Acts 21. 15. 18. And a Church-union in a constituted body
hearing the Word and receiving the Sacraments, as this Church did, Acts 2. 42.
is not a Church but in regard of Church-policy, and Church Government. They
reply, That enemies do persecute the Church, Acts 8. 1. Acts 12. 1. Acts 8. 3.
Saul made havoc of the Church, that is, of the faithful of the Church, for
Saul had no regard in his persecution, to a Church in their government, or
Church- combination, therefore the enemies are said to persecute the Church
materially.

I answer, this objection I took off before. But 2. Principally the enemies
persecuted the Church under the notion of Peaceable plea. c. 7. ad. ob. 1. page
81.
^ Society political holding forth in a visible Church-profession their faith
in Christ, and that by hearing, receiving the Seals, and subjecting themselves
in a visible way obvious to the Eye of all, to the government of the Christian
Church, Yea the enemies had no better character to discern them to be Saints,
and so worthy of their malice, then Church-characters of a Church-profession.
But 2. Whereas the Holy Ghost gives the name of one Church, to the Church of
Jerusalem, all constantly speaking of it both as a Church, and in relation to
persecuters, and that every way in that notion, as our Brethren say, that the
Scripture speaks of their own Corgregationall Church, we have the same
reason to call it one Church, because of one government; for the question is
not now if it be many Congregations, but it it be one Church.

Object. 2. They are called the Elders at Jerusalem, not the Elders of the
Church of Jerusalem; Ergo, from this it is not concluded that they were one
Church.
Answ. Acts 16. 4. they are called Apostles and Elders in, or at Jerusalem Acts
16. 4. for another cause, these were Elders from other Churches, from Antioch
no less, then Elders of Jerusalem, they only sat in Synod at Jerusalem. 2.
All Jerusalem was not converted to the Christian Faith, and therefore they may
well be termed Elders at Jerusalem, as the Church at Ephesus, at, or in
Thyatira. 3. I deny that the Scripture speaks any other ways of the Elders
of the Church of Jerusalem, then of the Elders of other Churches.

2. Those Elders ought to meet for the governing of the Church of Jerusalem,
for this was their duty; Ergo, they were one Presbytery. 2. They did meet Acts
15. 14. to receive Paul and Barnabas, and to hear what God had done by them
for their edification; and Acts 21. Paul goes to Jerusalem and is received v.
15. by the Brethren, but the next day, v. 18. The day following Paul went in
with us unto James and all the Elders were present; and there the Elders do
presbyterially act for the removing of a Church-scandall, v. 21. The believing
Jews were informed that Paul taught all the Jews which were amongst the
Gentiles to forsake Moses. This was a public scandal. 2. The offended
multitude were to convene, v. 22. as plaintiffs. 3. The Eldership ordains
Paul to remove the scandal by satisfying the offended, by purifying himself
after the manner of the Jews, and it is clear Paul should not have satisfied
the scandalized Jews, except James and the Elders had enjoined him so to do.
4. This the very course of a presbytery, yea, our Brethrens doctrine, which a
Congregationall presbytery would, and does take with any other person who does
give offense, yea though it be taken and not given, if the way of remedy be
lawful and expedient, as this presbytery conceived Paul's purifying of himself
to be, and if any scandalizing person should be disobedient to the voice of a
Congregationall eldership, such as our Brethren believe the Eldership of
Jerusalem to be; they would say they are to censure him, and therefore if Paul
should have been disobedient to this, he should have incurred a censure; It is
true Lorinus says that Chrysostom and Oecumenius will have this to be a
Counsel, not a Synod, to command Paul, and they Lorinus Diodatus, in loc.
deny any Juridicall power here, but v. 18. (...), to me it is, They were
gathered together: Diodatus calls them The college of the governors of the
Church, Beda Beda.
says there were four Synods and he makes the Synod Acts 1. at the choosing
of Matthias the first, the second at the choosing of Deacons Acts 6. the third
Acts 15. and this the fourth, Acts 21. 2. The Text seems to me to say it,
for as Acts 15. there was course taken for the Gentiles that they should
abstain from blood, lest they should either scandalize, or be scandalized; so
the Eldership here takes course that the infirm Jews be not scandalized, as
is clear, v. 25. As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written, etc.
and to me they seem to do both Synodically, some think that this fact of the
Elders and Paul was not lawful: but how ever, though it was not a general
council, a presbytery I take it to be taking course to remove a scandal from
the weak Jews in this place, as they had by a Synodicall power removed it
from the Gentiles, Act. 15. Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson in their modest and
brotherly answer to Mr. Charles Herle, c. 1. p. 6.


It is objected by Master Mather, that if a Church in an Island by Divine
institution, and so this first founded congregation at Jerusalem which did
meet in Salomons porch, had once an entire power of Jurisdiction within it
self, though in an extraordinary case. 1. The case is ordinary, as in the
Dominion of Wales, there is scarce a congregation to be found within twenty or
thirty miles. 2. Suppose the case were extraordinary and rare, may they violate
the ordinary rules of Christ? for so some may think and say, that though
according to ordinary Rules, Baptisms and the Lords Supper must be dispensed
only by men and by Ministers, yet in the want of these, the one may be
dispensed by a Woman, or Midwife, and both of them by such as are no Ministers.

Answ. We think a Ministry and Discipline more necessary to a Congregation in
a remote Island, or to the Church of Jerusalem before they increase to such a
number as cannot meet for their numerous multitude in one Congregation, then
the Sacraments, when there be no Ministers to dispense them. 1. That the Church
be so in the Island its alone, may possibly be extraordinary, but that in such
a case they have the Word preached and entire power of Discipline whole and
entire within themselves to excommunicate scandalous persons is not
extraordinay, when there be no consociated Churches, whom excommunication
concerns, that are in danger to be scandalized, for it flows connaturally
from a Church to which agrees the essence of a Church, to exercise
Jurisdiction over all its own members, if there be no more consociated with
that Church, that is by accident and an extraordinary exigence of Gods
providence. As a master of a Family is to do his duty to educate his children
in the fear of God; but if God take all his children from him by death, he
does not transgress the ordinary rule of educating his children in the fear
of God, when he has none. This argument supposes that a Congregation has no
power of excommunication at all either complete or incomplete, as the Midwife
has no power to Baptize at all either complete or incomplete: neither does a
Congregation transgress any rule of Christ at all when it exercises entire
power of censures within it self, whereas there be no consociated Churches to
share with it in that power. A Congregation is capable of entire Jurisdiction,
because it is a Church; But a woman in no case is capable of administrating
Baptism, or the Lords Supper, except she were extraordinarily and immediately
inspired to be a prophetess, but for the exercise of entire power of
Jurisdicton by a Congregation in a r^mote Island, I hope, it has no such need
of immediate inspiration. 2. There is no such moral necessity of the
Sacraments, as there is of the Ministry of the word and consequently of some
use of the Keys, where a scandalous person may infect the Lords flock. For
where vision cease the people perish, but it is never said, where Baptism
cease the people perish, and therefore uncalled Ministers in case of
necessity, without ordination or calling from a presbytery may preach, and take
on them the holy Ministry and exercise power of Jurisdiction, because the
necessity of the Souls of a Congregation, in a remote Island requires so, but
I hope no necessity in any the most extraordinary case requires that a Midwife
may Baptize, or that a private man remaining a private man may celebrate the
Lords Supper to the Church without any calling from the Church.

But Mr. Mather, if the power of Jurisdiction flow immediately and Mr. Mather,
and Mr. Thomson 1^. p. 4 5:
necessarily from the essence of a Church, and a congregation be essentially a
Church, then this power agrees to all Churches, whether consociated, or not
consociated, and without respect of what neighbors they have, whether many, or
few, whether any, or none. 2. A congregation its alone cannot have sole power
of jurisdiction, and then be deprived of it, when God sends neighbor
Churches; for then neighboring Churches which are given for help, should be
given for loss, the contrary whereof Ames Ames Medull. Theol. l. 1. c. 39.
sect. 37.
says. Nor do Synods (says he) constitute a new form of a Church.

Answ. Power of Jurisdiction flows from the essence of a congregation in an
Island; Ergo, a total and complete power of jurisdiction, flows from the
essence of a Church or congregation consociated; it follows no ways, so a
pastor of a Congregation has as a pastor power to rebuke sin, and to
administrate the Sacraments, Ergo, when three pastors are added to help him, he
has the sole power of rebuking sin, and the sole and entire power to
administrate the Sacraments, and none of these three pastors has power with
him, it follows not; and because these three pastors are added to help him
and their pastoral power added to him is cumulative and auxiliary, but not
privative or destructive of his pastoral power, therefore the first pastor
suffers loss by the addition of these three to him: who will say this? our
Brethren do conceive the power of Congregations, in its kind and essence, to be
Monarchical, so as if any power from consociated Congregations be added
thereunto, the Congregations power Monarchical is d minished; and the essence
of it changed. 2. Complete and entire power to rule both the Congregation and
the Members of consociated Churches in so far as they do keep communion with
that Congregation, and may either edify, or scandalize them, flows not
immediately and necessarily from the essence of every Congregation even in
remote Islands not consociated with others, that we never said. 3. A power to
govern well, and according to the rule of the word added to another power to
govern well and according to the word, is an auxiliary power and no way
destrective of that power, to which it is added, indeed a power to govern
well, added to a power of male administration in a Congregation is distructive
of that power, and reason it should be so, because Christ never gave any such
power of male administration to a Congregation; but a power of right governing,
added to a power of right governing is neither destructive thereof, nor does it
constitute a new form of a Church, or a Church- power, but only enlarge the
pr^existent form to extend it self farther, for the edification of more souls.

But (says Mr. Mather) if it be against the light of nature that the adverse
party be the sole judge which must be, if the s^le Mr. Mather, and Mr. Thomson
ib. p. 5.
power of Jurisdiction be in the Congregation (as we grant in an extraordinary
case, when a Congregation is in an Island its alone) and so it shall be lawful
for a single Congregation to do that which is against all equity and the very
light of nature, it must then follow that it is not against the light of nature
that a Congregation (though consociated with other Congregations) have entire
jurisdiction within it self.

Answ. None of us do teach that it is against the light of nature that the
adverse party be the judge, it might fall out in a general council lawfully
convened, from which there is no provocation, yea and in a national council,
(for all councels may err) the adverse party may judge, as it was a lawful
council according to a Church-constitution that condemned Christ of blisphemy,
and they were also his enemies; but we teach that it is not congruous to the
wisdom of Christ, nor to the light of nature, that Christ should have
appointed all the ordinary Churchcourts, so many thousand congregations, who
may rather err then extraordinary and higher Synods, to be the only ordinary
judges in their own cause; Nor does any thing more follow from this argument,
that when there is one congregation its alone in an Island destitute of the
help of consociated Churches (which is a defect of an extraordinary providence
of Christ in that one singular exigence) that that congregation shall be both
judge and party in its own cause, if we suppose that one Micaiah shall contend
for the truth, and all the rest of the Prophets and people of that congregation
to be against the truth, and to judge and condemn one man, who seeks the
Lord in truth.

It is a wonder to me that Thessalonica was but one single congregation, all
hearing one Word, partakers of one Lords Supper at one Table; yet the Apostle
ascribes to them that which is a note to worthy Baynes of the numerous
multitude of the Church of Jerusalem, from whence went the Word of God to all M
Mather and Thomson c. 3. p. 33, 35.
the world, 1 These. 1. 8. For from you sounded out the Word of the Lord, not
only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to Godward
is spread abroad. I deny not what Mr. Mather and Thomson say, but 5000 may meet
to hear the word, and many thousands were gathered together Luke 12. to hear
Christ; but these reverend brethren do leave out, 1. The inconvenience of
thronging so all at once; for, they trod one upon another. 2. Christ preached
not to all those thousand at once, for it is expressly said, v. 1. He began to
say to his Disciples. So Christ refusing to preach to such a disorderly
confluence of people, who could not hear, and his doctrine being all for his
Disciples, the very Sermon being preached to his Disciples only, Matthew. 10. 2,
3, 4, etc. and the Parable of the rich man v. 22. he applies to his Disciples,
Then he said to his Disciples, therefore I say unto you, take no thought for
your life, etc. It evidenceth to me that Christ condemns a numerous multitude
in one congregation to hear at once. And whereas Chrysostom says, 5000
persons did hear his voice, at once, in one congregation, by means of
Scaffolds and Galleries; and Mr. Mather is willing to yield eight thousand an
hundred and twenty were all assembled in one place to Chrysostom on Math. 24.

M. Mather. c. 2 page 34.


hear the Word, and that all the multitude of converts at Jerusalem were
together in Salomons porch, Act. 5. 12. I grant three thousand could hear one
at once; but alas, this is a great uncertainty for independent congregations.
But 1. this is to be proved that eight thousand (Mr. Mather has not added many
other multitudes mentioned, Act. 5. 14. Act. 6. 1. v. 7. and elsewhere) did
meet daily in the Temple. 2. Daily and ordinarily from house to house. 3. To
celebrate the Lords Supper daily in the Temple and in every private house
(there were need of many Scaffolds and Galleries) to sit at one Table. 4. To
make one judicature, and have more then power of consenting in Church.
censures, as our brethren prove the whole Church of believers had, from Matthew.
18. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 4. Act. 15. 22. 1 Cor. 14. 23. for my part I think such a
miraculous Church cannot be the first mould of independent Churches to be
established congregations meeting in one place, for to be edified by word,
seals and censures. Yea Mr. Mather will have the whole convening as one
independent congregation Act. 6. 2, 3, 4. and the many myriades or thousands of
believing Jews, Act. 21. 21, 22, 23. to meet as one congregation. Certainly
the Apostles practice must be our rule, and then five hundred or a thousand
being so far beneath ten or eight thousand, may well seem a number for
fewness not competent; and what shall we then think of seven only, or ten?
Now let it be considered, if Rome being granted to be one Church, and in which
to me there was a congregation and Church in the very family of Aquila and
Priscilla, Romans 16. v. 5. and whose faith was spread through all the world,
Romans 1. 8. so as famous writers say the half of the City believed, if they be
but one single congregation meeting all in one place? ard to me it is clear,
there was a single congregation in the very house of Aquila and Priscilla, Act.
18. 1, 2, 3 4. v. 26 27, 28. and that Paul preached when he was there daily,
beside his disputing in the Synagogue; when he was at Rome there was a Church
at his house, Romans 16. 5. So Diodati says on the place, That the Church at
Aquila his house was the assembly of believers, who assembled themselves in
their house; for there were diverse small assemblies in one and the self same
City, 1 Cor. 16. 19. Col. 4. 15. Greet the Church that is at their house. Col.
1. 15. Salute Nymphus, and the Church at his house. Where Paul speaks of
believers only in a house, he gives them not the name of a Church, as To. 16.
10. Salute them that are of Aristobulus household. V. 11. Greet them that are of
the household of Narcissus. Phil. 4. 22. All the Saints salute you, especially
those that are of Caesar's house. I desire to know a reason of the difference of
this Grammar, if there were no constituted Church in the house of Aquila and
Priscilla, why in one Chapter the Apostle should change the phrase? and I
desire know what reason we have to go from the literal meaning of the word,
that is, a Church at Aquila his house, as well as a Church at C^rinth. For
whereas some say that Romans 1. 6. he saluteth not all of the house of Narcissus,
but only v. 11. those which are is the Lord; 1. this exception is not brought
concerning the house of Aristobulus, v. 10. 2 This exception confirms what I
say, because where there is not a Church and an institured Society and
political Church-meeting in the house of any of the Saint, there they are
called believers of such a house, and not a Church at such a house. 3. This
phrase (...) used Romans 16. 5. 1 Cor. 16. 19. Col. 4. 19. Phile. 2. must be the
same with the Saints assemblea for the Word and Sacraments. Act. 5. 42. in the
Temple, (...) from house to house daily, and it must be allope with Act. 2. 46.
Where they continued daily in the Temple with one accord, (...), and breaking
bread from house to house; and all one with the assembly of Disciples Act 20.
7. where they assembled for the Word and Sacrament of the Supper, especially
seeing as the learned acknowledge, the Christians could not have Temples or
houses built for the public assemblies of the Saints as Rome and Corinth, but
they met in private houses; which seeing it cannot be denied, then were there
at Rome two Churches at least; one at the house of Aquila and Priscilla, 1 Cor.
16. 15. and another also pertaining to the rest of the Saints at Rome.

And this says, that if there had been but one single Congregation at Rome,
whereas one family had a Church, c. 165. and so many illustrious families
received the faith of Christ, it is like their faith could not have been
published through all the world, Romans 1. 8. if the Christian faith had not had
a greater prevalency in comparison of the false God^ then worshipped at Rome,
then to be in one poor single meeting.

And for the Church of Corinth, I humbly conceive they could not be one single
congregation, if these four circumstances be considered: 1. The multitude of
believers there. 2. The multitude of Teacher^. 3. The diversity of Tongues. 4.
A Presbyteriall meeting of Prophets, 1 Cor. 14. For the first, Act. 18. 9. Many
of the Corinthians believed, and were baptized. Now if we shall believe that
the Apostolic Church conjoined preaching and baptizing, the Word and the
Sacraments; and that the Apostles baptized none but those to whom they
preached, I conceive it cannot be denied but there were diverse assemblies for
the Word and the Sacrament; for Paul, 1 Cor. 14. 15. Baptized n^ne but Crispus
and Gaius, and the household of Stephanus; it many were baptized, other Pastors,
not Paul baptized them, 1 Cor. 1. 14, 15, 16. and so they were baptized in
other assemblies, then in those in which Paul baptized. 2. It is clear that to
comfort Paul whose spirit could not but be heavy, as you may gather from Romans
7. 2, 3. because he was Act. 18. 6, 7. resisted so in his ministry by the
blasphemies of the Jews rejecting the Gospel, that he shook his raiment on
them, and said, your blood be upon your own heads, I am clean; from
henceforth I will go to the Gentiles; The Lord says unto him in a vision, 9.
Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace, 10. For I am with thee, and
no man shall set on thee, for I have much people in this City. 11. And he
continued there a year and six months, teaching the Word amongst them. Now
let this in equity be considered, if the gaining of one single congregation
which meet for the Word, Sacraments, 1 Cor. 11. 20, 21, 22. 1 Cor. 14. 19. and
also to acts of Church Censures 1 Cor. 5. 4. as our brethren teach, which could
not exceed one thousand conveniently in a settled and daily meeting, had first
been much people; secondly, much, in comparison of thousands of the Jews who
rejected the Lord Jesus, as may be gathered from comparing Act. 18. 5, 6. and
Act. 13. 43, 46, 47. with Act. 21. ^0. where it is said, many thousands of the
Jews believed, for the greatest part of the Jews rejected Christ, as is
clear 1 Thessalonians. 2. 14. 15. 16. and so many more thousands behoved to reject
Christ then believed? Now what comfort could Paul have had in this, that many
thousands of the Jews rejected the Gospel, and yet all the much people that
God had in Corinth were but fo^soot^ to the number of one complete Assembly of
a single Congregation, which did meet in a private House, for the celebration
of the Lords Supper? For Piscator with all our Divines, 1 Cor. 14 teach that
their were no capacious Temples in Corinth, where they did meet for Gods
worship. 2. Judge if one single Congregation (for the Congregations planted by
the Apostles behoved to be competent, and convenient for edification, that all
might hear and all partake of one bread, 1 Cor. 10. 16. and one Table of the
Lord, v. 21.) could necessitate Paul to stay at Corinth a year and six
months, when as Paul by one Sermon made in a certain man's House named Justus
did bring many to believe and be Baptized, Acts 18 7. 8. And these many might
conveniently make a Congregation beside the much people that God had there, v.
10. not yet called, but yet they were, as interpreters say, the Lords people,
by Gods decree of predestination. 2. The multitude of Teachers proves that
their were more Congregation then one; for 1. It is incongruous to the Wisdom
of Christ to raise up many reapers, where the harvest is narrow, many builders
for one congregationall House. 2. It is contrary to Christ's practice, who sent
not twelve Pastors to one place, but sent them out two by two, that all might
find work: now can we think, that where God had much people, as Acts 18. 10.
that he would have hundreths of Prophets to be hearers and one at once to speak
to one single Congregation? to what end gave the Lord a Talent to such a huge
multitude of prophets? that they might be oftener hearers, then they could be
in actual prophesying? It is not like. 3. Whereas it is said, 1 Cor. 14. 31.
you may all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted,
Di^datus says, ye may all prophecy, namely by course and in diverse or
several Assemblies. And Estius says the same, to wit, that these Prophets
were to prophecy in diverse assemblies; and for this it is that he says, v:
34. let your women (...) keep silence (...), in the Churches; Ergo, he
supposes there were more Congregations then one at Corinth; Nor is there
reason to say with some, he speaks of Churches in the plural number, because
he made mention of all the Churches of the Saints in the verse going before,
for 1. He says, your Wom^n, let them be silent: now if he had not meant that
there were many Congregations at Corinth, he would not have forbidden it in
their Women, but of all Women, and it is known there was a great abuse of
spiritual gifts in Corinth, so as women did prophecy in the assemblies, and
this the Apostle forbids in their Churches in the pl^^ all number. And I
pray you what room or place was there for such a multitude of Prophets to
edify the Churches in one private House? for there were no Temples where they
might meet at Corinth. 4. If Kenchrea be comprehended under the Church of
Corinth in this Epistle, and the Apostle writing to the Corinthians wrote also
to this Church called Romans 16. 1. The Church at Kenchrea, then have we more
Congregations then one at Corinth. Now the learned teach that Kenchrea was a
Seaport or Harbor of the Corinthians, Origin, prefa. in (...).
Origin says it was a place near to Corinth. Off the Aegean Sea one the East,
and as Strabo. l. 18.
Strabo says, ad sinum Saronicum, as Lechea was the other port. See Plinius
not. Hist. l. 4. c. 4.
Plinius. And the multitude of Teachers (I humbly conceive) which did preach at
Korinth may be gathered from 1 Cor. 1. 5. 1 Cor. 4. 6. 15. 1 Cor. 1. 12, 13. 1
Cor. 3. 4, 5. 1 Cor. 14. where there are multitudes of these who were all
gifted to edify others, as those who spoke with Tongues, wrought miracles, had
the gift of healing. And so many Prophets that Paul says, v. 31. for ye may
all prophecy, that all may lear^e, and all may be comforted, if these (all) who
were to learn, and to be comforted be the much people which God had in this
City Acts 18. 9. and this (all) to be instructed and comforted, I have no
farther to say. And 3. I can hardly believe that the end why God sent the gift
of diverse tongues amongst them was to e^ifie one single Congregation: for it
is true that our Brethren say, that 1 Corinthia^s verse. 22. 14. Tongues are for
a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not. But that which
they hence collect is most groundless, to wit, that therefore the gift of
Tongues, according to its genuine end and intention is only a miracle for the
gaining of Heathen to the Faith, and not intended to edify the Church and
people of a strange Language, after they are brought in to the Church, and
therefore there is no ground for people of diverse congregations to be
instructed by strange Tongues.

Ans. The whole current of Divines answer, (as also Estius observes on the
place) Tongues are given especially for infidels, ut novitate mirac^li
convertantur, that by the newness of the miracle they may be converted, though
also Tongues serve to instruct these who believe, and consequently; say I, that
the Churches of diverse Tongues may be edified. And let me add that strange
Tongues were a mixed miracle. I say mixed, because both they were given to be a
miraculous sign to assure Heathen, that the sending down of the Holy Ghost
was a miraculous fruit of Christ's Ascension to Heaven; who promised that when
he was ascended to the Father, he would send the other comforter, as is clear
Acts 2, 89, 10, 11 12. and also it was so a miracle that Paul proves that it
is fruitless and wants the natural and genuine end of speech and an humane
voice in the Church, if it edify not, as 1. Tongues edify not the Church,
except you speak to these who know the Language, or except there be an
Interpreter, for other ways the speaker with Tongues shall be as a Barbarian to
these to whom ^e speaks, and they as Barbarians to him 1 Cor. 14. 6. 7. 8 9,
10, 11. 2 He that speaks with Tongues is to pray that he may interpret, v.
13. That he may edify the Church. 3. He that speaks with Tongues, if he be
not understood, is fruitless and useless to others, because the hearers can
neither say amen to his preaching, nor to his praying, v. 14. 15, 16, 17. (4)
except a man teach others, his gift of Tongues teaches not the Church, v. 18,
19 10. (5) strange Tongues in the Church when the hearers understand not, are a
judgment of God rather then an edifying of the Church, v. 21. and c. hence it
is more then evident, that the edifying end, why the Lord had raised up these
in the Church of Corinth, (which was now a planted and watered Church, 1 Cor.
1. 1. chapter 3 5, 6, 7. and a building, the foundation whereof was laid, v. 10.
11, 12, etc.) was that the Church might be edified. And so the gift of Tongues,
as touching its edifying use and end, was fruitless, and of no effect; yea as
we teach against Papists, unlawful in Gods public worship, except there had
been diverse assemblies and Congregations, which understood these Tongues. Nor
can it be said, that all in Corinth understood Greek. And therefore these of
diverse Tongues might be understood by all: for 1. This lays a ground that
there was no Tongue a strange Tongue, but the Greek Tongue. 2. That all
speaking with strange Tongues was well understood, whereas the Apostle says
the contrary, v. 10. 11, 12. v. 16. v. 23. That many spoke with Tongues in that
Church, and yet the hearers could not say amen to them, nor be edified by their
preaching or praying, v. 19. if then strange Tongues were gifts of God given to
that planted Church to edify these who believed, and to edify the Church, as
well as to gain heathen, there must needs be diverse Congregations at Corinth,
and therefore I cannot but think that weak which Mr. Mather; and Mr. Thomson
say; But the Mr. Mather, Mr. Thomson answ. t^ Mr. H^. l^ c. 5. ^. ^7.
place, 1 Cor. 14. 23. That speaks of the whole Church coming together to
one place does unavaydably prove, that Corinth had their meetings, and not by
way of distribution into several congregations, but altogether in one
congregation: and it is plain, that though they had variety of Teachers and
Prophets. yet they all used to c^^^e together to one place.

I answ. 1. The place, 1 Cor. 14. 23. if the whole Church come together, etc.
does evince the contrary, for the Apostle does there reason ab absurdo, from a
great incongruity; it were incongruous (says he) and ridiculous that the whole
Church of Corinth, and all their gifted men speaking with diverse Tongues (so
that they could not be understood by Infidells) should all convene in one
place, and speak with diverse Tongues, for the unlearned and the unbelievers
would say they were mad; therefore he presupposes that the whole Church
should not all come to one place, but that they should so come to one place v.
24. in diverse assemblies, and all prophecy in a Tongue known to the
Infidells, as the unbeliever being convinced and judged of all the Prophers. he
might fall down on his face, and worship God, and say, God is in you of a
truth. 2. The whole Church is not the whole, much people of Corinth that
believed, that did ordinarily meet in one place; the Text says no such thing,
and that is to be proved and not taken as granted, and so the consequence is
most avoydable; for 1. You must say that at any one Assembly, all the Prophets
and Teachers of Corinth did prophecy, for the Text says, v. 24. He is
convinced of all, he is judged of all. Whereas the consequence should be
absurd, it should be a longesome and we^^^ some meeting; for Interpreters say
they meet in diverse Assemblies, and the Text says expressly, v. 29. That at
one meeting they prophesied, but two or three: now if two only prophesied in
one Congregation at one Assembly, as this Text will warrant clearly, then how
does this whole Church consisting of all the Believers of Corinth, a^ is
supposed by our Brethren, convince the infidel, so as it may bear this sense,
v. 24. He is convinced of all, he is judged of all? can two Prophets be all
Prophets? And how does it be^re this v. 24. But if all prophecy, etc? surely,
for my part, I think it must unavoydably be said, that they all prophesied
distributively and in several Congregations. And it is very probable to me,
that as women prophesied, so many prophesied at once, and that the Apostle
corrects their abuse, when he will have them to prophecy by course, v. 27.
And that too numerous a multitude did prophecy in one Assembly, and therefore
the Apostle reducing this Church to order, retrencheth the number v. 29. to two
or three, and so this which he says v. 31. for you may all prophecy one by
one, etc. must unavoydably be understood distributively in diverse Congregations
and Assemblies, and so must we take the words where it is said, v. 24. all the
Prophets convince, all judge, distributively; and the whole Church v. 23. by
this cannot bear this sense, that the whole Church of Corinth comprehending
the the whole Prophets. Teachers, and ^elievers, did all collectively meet in
one single Assembly. And that the much people which the Lord had at Corinth,
Acts 18. 9. was one society partaking of one Table of the Lord, in one private
house, and all in one consistory judging and censuring and excommunicating.

Lastly, I think (with reverence of the learneder) that these Prophets were a
College of Teaching Prophets whose gifts were employed in edifying several
Congregations; only some, say they, were Prophets extrordinarily inspired. 2.
They were not Prophets of the Church of Corinth, and therefore are not any
pattern of a Presbytery, but I answer. 1. Though they were Prophets
extraordinarily inspired, yet do they prove well some ordinary acts of a
Presbytery, and that 2. They were Prophets of that same Church of Corinth, I
conceive; For they do here Prophecy according to the analogy of Faith, and that
they have common with Prophets now adays. 2. They are by these same rules
regulated that our Pastors are now. 3. They exercise these same acts of
Jurisdiction which Pastors do now exercise. 1. They are to prophecy in a known
Tongue, v. 19. 20, 21, 22* and that the edification and comfort of the Church,
^. 31. even as P^stors now adays, only the internal principle, to wit, the
insused gift of prophesying made them extraordinary Prophets, in fi^ri, as our
Prophets become Prophets by ordinary industry and studies, in furi: but in
facto esse, and according to the substance of the acts of prophesying, these
extraordinary Prophets, and our ordinary Prophets and Pastors differ not in
specie and nature. As the Eyes put in the man borne blind Ioh. 9. and these
Eyes which we suppose he was capable of from his mothers womb, and the Wine
miraculously made out of water by Jesus Christ, Ioh. 2. and the Wines that grew
in Judea, according to their manner of production and in fieri differed, but in
facto esse they were of the same nature. Hence you see in the Text these
Prophets are every way regulated as ordinary prophets, and as the Prophets of
the Church of Corinth. 1 Because it is acknowledged by all Interpreters that
the scope of the Chapter is to prescribe what is order and decency in the
public worship in the Church of Corinth; as the last verse says, v. 40. let
all things be done decently and in order, and consequently how these Prophets
should edify the Church of Corinth, v. 4. 12 16, 17. (^) That these Prophets
should not speak in public the language of Barbar^an, v. 11, 12. to the which
the hearer could not say Amen, v. 16. and this way are our ordinary Prophets
regulated, except that Papists will but say service in Latin, (3) A direction
is put on the Prophets, on these who speak with Tongues, that they be not
children in understanding, and that they be, in malice, as children, but as
concerning understanding, men, v. 20. which agrees well to Prophets as they
are ordinary Pastors. (4) What more ordinary, then the coming together of the
whole Church for prophesying, v. 23. 24. and convincing of unbelievers? a^ 25.
(5) the Prophets are to be limited to a way of speaking to edification, as he
who speaks with Tongues, who must speak by an Interpreter, or then be silent
in the Church, v. 27. 28. (6) These Prophets, a^ our ordinary Prophets, must
speak orderly, and that but one at once, to eschew confusion, v. 29. (7) What
they speak is to be judged and put under censure, for the whole College must
judge, v. 29. 8. (8) And as the women are here put under a rule, when to speak,
and when to be silent, v. 34. 35. So are these prophets, all which, and diverse
other rules do regulate our ordinary Prophets, which clearly says to me,
that this is a pattern of a College of ordinary Prophets under that same
policy and rules of policy as the ordinary College of Pastors at Corinth, and
3. To this College agrees a power dogmaticall of judging, and censuring the
Doctrine of the Prophets delivered, 29. let the Prophets speak two or three,
and let the other judge. This is not a power of judging that every Christian
has. For (...) says Piscator, does relate to the Prophets who are to judge;
But (as I take it) a prophetical judging, which may, by good anology, warrant
the juridicall power of a presbytery to judge and examine these who preach the
word, that there creep not in false Teachers into the Church.

And for Ephesus. The huge number of Believers and yet making one Church, Rev.
2. 2. says that Ephesus was a presbyteriall Church as many circumstances
evince, Acts 19. for. 1. Paul established twelve men Prophets who spoke with
Tongues, and prophesied. To what end did Paul set up twelve Laborers at
Epheseus, with diverse languages, but to establish diverse Assemblies? did they
all meet daily in one house with Paul to hear him, and turned silent Prophets
themselves, when they were indeed with the gift of Tongues to speak to the
edification of Assemblies of diverse tongues? It is not credible. 2. And v. 10.
Paul continued here for the space of two years, (and was this for one
competent number, who did all meet in one private house? how can this be
credible?) 3. All that dwelt in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both
Jews and Greeks, then in great Ephesus there behoved to be more then one
Congregation. 4. The great miracles done by Paul. v. 11. 12. to admiration of
all, and to procure the imitation of false Prophets. 5. The name of the Lord
Jesus was magnified by the Jews and Greeks that dwelt at Ephesus. 6. There
behoved to be a great work of God, when great Ephesus turned to the faith. It
is, 1. Remarkable that Christ the wisdom of the father directed his Apostles
to the most famous Cities, to cast out their nets, for conquering of souls to
Christ, as in Indea they came to Samaria, and to great Jerusalem; in Syria to
Antiochia, in Grecia to Corinth, in Italy to Rome, in Asia the less to
Ephesus; now the Scripture is clear the Apostles, that ever we read, planted
but one Church, as is clear in one City in Jerusalem, in Antiochia, in
Corinth, in Rome, in Ephesus: and observe, the basis and prime principle of our
Brethrens independent Churches does all ly upon this mere conjecture, that the
Lords Grace did restrict and limit the fruits of the triumphing Gospel, in the
hands of the Apostles the conquerors of the World to Jesus Christ, that they
planted but in the greatest Cities they came to (and they appointed Elders in
every City) only one poor single Congregation, as a pattern of all
independent Churches, and this consisted of no more then could meet
conveniently in one House for Word, Sacraments, one Lords Table, and one
Ecclesiastical Church- court for censures. Certainly this Church being a
pattern to all instituted Churches, could not exceed the number of a thousand
men, or two thousand Believers, and this is a greater number by some hundreds,
I am sure, then can make a competent Church-meeting, and I hope no man could
say we erred, if we should now make eight or ten thousand one Congregation in
ordinary, as our Mr. Mather and Mr. Thomson against Herle. c. 3. p. 34.
Brethren say the first Congregationall Church of Jerusalem wa^. B^t. 2. This
City was the mother City and flower of Asia. 2. It was noble, because of
Diana's Temple, the length whereof was four hundred and twenty five foot, the
breadth two hundred and twenty foot, the pillars were an hundred and twenty
seven, the height of every pillar was sixty foot. Amongst which there were
thirty pillars most curiously carded. Others say they were an hundred and
thirty seven pillars made by several Kings, the Temple was built by all Asia
for the space of two hundred and twenty, (some say) forty years. It was
enlarged by Alexander; And thither came all Asia the less to the Temple of
great Diana. For they had no other Religion, here dwelt the proconsull of Asia,
as says Philostratus l. 8. in vit. Apollonii.
Philostratus, It abounded with arts and Sciences, Philosophers and Orators,
Chrysostom. in praesa. ad Ephesians.
Chrysostom says that in it were Pythagaras, Parmenides, Zeno, Democritus, it
was compassed with excellent Cities, and noble for Asiatick commodities, see
Plinius l. 36 c. 14:
Plinius, and Alexander ab Alexandro. l. 3. c. 20.
Alexander Neopolitanus, Igna ^i Epist. 14.
Ignatius highly commendth it from the purity of the Gospel. All this I relate
not as an unpertient digression, but to show that the Gospel behoved to be
more mighty here; then that Paul set up but one single Congregation and an
Eldership congregationall only, Acts 20. 28. v. 36. 37. Especially consider
what Beasts Paul fought with at Ephesus, for here were many Jews who opposed
him. 2. All the multitude, by the instigation of Demetrius, avowing that their
Diana was the goddess not only of Ephesus but of all Asia; yet God made the
word so mightily to prevail, for v. 10. Paul remaining there by the space of
two years, all that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and
Greeks. I ask how it could stand with Paul's universal commission to preach to
Jew and Gentiles, 1 Cor. 9. 20. 21. as an Apostle, to ^em^ine near three years
at Ephesus for one single congregation, and the erecting of one Congregationall
presbytery? 3. We see how zealously mad they have been on their Religion, when
they had such a curious Temple for Diana. And 4. Demetrius and the crafts had
their living by making silver shrines to Diana. And 5. What power of the
Gospel it behoved to be, which made their learned men who used curious arts,
to submit to the Gospel and bring their Books and burn them before all men?
and the sums of these Books extended to a great sum of money, the common people
ordinarily follow the learned and the wise of the City and Land; This could not
have been done except the far greater part of the City had submitted to the
Gospel, for when they were well near ready to tear Paul in pieces, they
behoved to be wounderfully tamed, when many Believed, and came and confessed
and showed their deeds, v. 18. Baynes com. on 1. chapter Ephesians. says, Ephesus was
a City sogiven to riot that it banished Hermodor. Upon no other consideration,
but because he was an honest sober man; And also Paul 1 Cor. 16. says, v. 9.
for a great door and effectual is open to me at Ephesus, This was, as all
Interpreters Protestant and popish say, uno ore, a large harvest. Upon these
considerations, I leave to our reverend Brethren their judgment: if Mr.
Mather, and Mr. Mr. Mather, ans. to Mr. Herle. c. 3. p. 38, 39.
Thomson say right, we do not think they were more in number at Ephesus, then
in Corinth and Jerusalem, where the Christians met all in one place.

Likewise Samaria a numerous City was one Church, for that it is said of them,
Acts 8, 5, 6. They heard Philip, v. 14. Samaria received the Word, it was a
public visible Churchreceiving of the word; and v. 12. They believed and were
Baptized both men and women. Where a multitude no better then Heathen as
Samaria was, receive the Seal of the Covenant, to wit Baptism, they must
receive it in a Church Way, except we think that promiscuously all come to age
were received to the Seals, and when Peter and John came to Samaria to help
Philip in the work, it cannot be that they all went to one House, and to one
single Assembly to preach the Word;

The Church of Antiochia must be a Presbyteriall Church, a^ it is Acts 11. v.
19. 20. for the multitude of Believers may be collected from These who were
scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Steven -- 20 -- when
they were come to Antioch, spaks unto the Grecians preaching the Lord Jesus.
21. and the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed and
turned to the Lord. This is not like to be one Congregation, seeing they are,
1. much people. 2. many scattered preachers. 3. And the Hand of the Lord
accompained their labors 2. v. 23. when Barnabas, sent by the Church of
Ierusasalem, came and saw the Grace of God, he exhorted them all, That with
purpose of heart they would cleave to the Lord, and upon Barnabas his
preaching, v. 24. -- much people was added to the Lord. Here is a second
accession made to the Church of Antioch. (3) v. 25. Then departed Barnabas to
Tarsus to seek Saul. 26. And when he had found him, he brought him to
Antioch. And it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with
the Church, and taught much people (here is a third accession;) And such a huge
multiplication, that the Church of Antioch gives a denomination of
Christianity to all the Christian Churches of the World. All which says, it
cannot be one poor single Congregation, for there was at least, if not more
then one Congregation at Antioch, when tidings came to Jerusalem that the Lord
had a Church at Antioch, before they sent Barnabas to these Churches, v. 22.
and what might this Church grow to when much people was added to the Lord, by
the labors of Barnabas? v. 24. And how was it increased when Barnabas and Paul
after that taught the Word to much people a whole year? v. 26. It grew after
that a great Church, so that Chrysostom. homil. 3. ^^ popul. Antioch.
Chrysostom commends Antioch for the prime Church. And Oecumenius in loc.
Oecumenius says, for this cause there was a Patriarch appointed at Antioch,
which certainly says thus much, that it was a more numerous Church then one
single Congregation, and Cyril. Catech. 7.
Cyrillus so extolled the Church of Antioch, because the Disciples were first
named Christians there, that he says, this was the new name that Esaiah said
the Mouth of the Lord Esai, 62. v. 2
should name, and so does Hilarious l. ^. de Trinitats.
Hilarious expound the Text; which, seeing it is clearly the new glory of the
Church of the Gentiles, adjoined to the Church of the Jews, it cannot arise
from a handful of a single Congregation, in the mind of these Fathers, and
though we love not with some antiquity to make Antioch the first Church before
Rome; yet seeing it was of old before Rome, we may hence collect that that
Church which was patriarchall, was not Congregationall, and therefore I make no
use hereof, Volaterranus l. 5. c. 23.
Volaterranus who says of old the Patriarch of Antioch had under him 14.
Metropolitans, 53. Bishops, and 366 Temples, only it is like that Antiquity
has believed that there was a great number of Believers in this Church at
first. Now to These, which to me prove it was more then one Congregation, we
may add that there was, Chapter 13. 1. in the Church that was at Antioch, certain
Prophets and Teachers, as they are reckoned out; These at Antioch Ministered to
the Lord, in public prayers (says Beza in loc.
Beza) and preaching, and (says Diodatus an.
Diodatus) in administration also of the Sacraments, and other parts of the
Evangelick Ministry Oecumenius in loc.
Oecumenius (...). Now I would know what all these Prophets and Doctors, beside
Paul and Barnabas who preached a whole year at Antioch, did, in peaching to
one single Congregation? and also it is said, Acts 15. 35. Paul and Barnabas
continued at Antioch, Teaching and preaching the Word of Lord (...), with also
many others. Certainly here is a College of preaching Pastors, who also did
lay hands on Paul and Barnabas, Acts 13. v. 3. which all could not be busied in
Teaching one single Congregation at Antioch.

Mr. Mather says that the whole multitude of the Church of Antioch were
gathered together Acts 14. 27. and Acts 15. 30, 31. Mr. Mather, against Herle
c. ^op. 50.
to hear the Epistle read which was sent from the Synod. Therefore this Church
was no more then might meet in one place.

Answ. I answer, the place Acts 14. 27. is the representative Church, for they
met for a point of Discipline, at least for a matter that concerned all the
Churches, to wit, to know how God had opened the door of faith to the
Gentiles, then must the many thousands of Men and Women, which made up the
Church at Jerusalem, Acts 2. 42. Acts 4. 4. Acts 5. 14. Acts 6. 1. v. 7. Acts
21. v. 22. be many Congregations; now any Man may judge, how unpossible it was
for the many thousands of the Church of Jerusalem to meet as one Congregation,
for the Lords Supper and matters of Discipline, and it is known that the many
thousands of the believing Jews convened to the feast did not make one Church,
Acts 21. 20. 21, 22. for our Brethren say, that was an extraordinary confluence
of many people from all ^udea came to the feast of Pentecost. And this, many
learned Protestant Divines answer to that place. But 2. I do believe that the
assembling of the multitude at Antioch, c. 15. v. 30. which says Judas and
Silas gathered to^ether the multitude, and delivered the Epistle, and Acts 11.
26. and Barnabas and Paul their assembling with the Church a year, must be
taken distributively. And that there were more assemblings of the multitude and
Church at Antioch then one, for Silas, Paul, Barnabas abode a good space at
Antioch and taught the Word of the Lord with many others, Acts 15. 34 35. and
therefore there is no ground or warrant, to say, that the Epistle was read to
all that meeting in one day, and at one meeting, and as little warrant there is
to say that Barnabas and Paul assembled themselves, Acts 11. 26. with one and
the same single Church-assembly consisting of all the Christians at Antioch, in
one house, and in one day, the space of the whole year in which they abode at
Antioch, nor shall I believe that Paul and Barnabas and many other Teachers at
Antioch, Acts 15. 35. Acts 11. 20, 26. Acts 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. assembled all in
one material house at one single Church-convention: but it suteth not with the
wisdom of Christ who sent his Disciples out, two by two, for the hastening of
the work, Mat. 10. That they did all, even the many prophets at Antioch, Acts
15. 35. Acts 13. 1. 2. only bestow their labors upon one single Congregation.
And the word Church, and (Synagogue) both are taken distributively in the
Scripture, and must of necessity be taken so. And so must we take the word,
Exodus 12. 6. and so Ainsworth an. in Exo. 12.
Ainsworth reads it, and the (lamb) shall be kept by you, until the
fourteenth day of this month, and the whole Church of the congregation of
Israel shall kill it. between the two evenings, and immolabunt eum (...) Arias
Montan Exo. 12. 6.
Arias Montanus turns it, omnis cetus catus Synagogae Israel. Now the Word
(...) in that place must be taken distributively. For all the children of
Israel collectively did not meet to slay the Lamb; for the Text says, v. 3.
it was to be slain in the House, that is, (says Ainsworth,
Ainsworth) as the Greek translateth, Houses. And here v. 3. (...) according
to the House of their Fathers. The word (House) here must be taken
distributively for Rivet. com. in Ex. 12.
Rivetus with great reason inclines to think that the Passover was not a
Sacrifice properly so called. And truly to me the Lord does determine the
question, Jer. 7. 22. for I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in
the day that I brought them out of the Land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings
and sacrifice, for 2 Chro. 30, v. 2. 17. there is no necessity to expound the
place of these convivall Lambs of the Passover, but of other Sacrifices
offered at this time, see Lyran in. 2. Par. c. 30.
Lyran, and Caset. ib.
Cajetanus. And also Corcel. a lap. com in loc. v. 6.
Cornelius a lapide says on the words (because he can find no ground for the
Moss in the place) hinc pate^ universos sacerdotes non immolasse hos agnos
paschales in Templo, uti sentit Claudius Saints, 1. Repet. Eucharist. c. 7.
Abulensis in Exodus 16. and ex eo Serrarius in Josu. 5. 9. 22. and it is
certain every Master of the Family did slay his own Lamb, and Diodatus on
Exodus 12.
Diodatus on these words (in every House) to show the communion of the Church,
in the enjoying of Christ and his benefi^s. And the 70. Inter.
seventy Interpreters render the place, Exo. 12. 6. (...); and Chald. para.
the Chaldee paraphrast, etc. (...) immolabunt eum omnis Ecclesia filiorum
Israel. Hieron.
Hieron. immolabit eum universa multitudo filiorum Israel. However, there were
neither Priests nor Temple as yet in Israel, when they came out of Egypt. And
therefore every head of a Family did slay the Lamb, and so the Church of the
Congregation distributively taken slew the Lamb, every one by himself; and so
is the word (Synagogue) taken where its every way a Congregationall assembly;
as Mat. 13. 54. And when he was come to His own Country, He taught them in
their Synagogue (...), The word (Synagogue) must be taken distributively. For
he did not teach in one single Synagogue only in his own Country, but in many
Synagogues, one after another, in diverse places, and at diverse times; as it is
expounded, Luke 4. 44. and He was preacking, (...), in the Sgnagogues of
Galilee, in the plural number, Mat. 9. 35. He went about all Towns and
Villages teaching in their Synagogues, etc. Joh. 18. 54. I ever taught in the
Synagogues, and daily in the Temple whither the Jews always refort. And
therefore (Synagogue) Mat. 13. 54. in the singular number must be expounded
distributively, for many Synagogues in diverse places and diverse times, and so
do I think the word (Church) and muluitude Acts 11. 26. Acts 5. 30. must be
taken distributively; and so the word Church is taken. 1 Cor. 14. 19. Yet in
the Church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may
teach others, then ten thousand words in an unknowen Tongue. Paul (I hope)
desired not to speak in a known tongue to edify in one single Congregation
of Corinth only, but in all the Churches where he taught, and 1 Cor. 14 35. It
is a shame for a Woman to speak in the Church: the word Church cannot be in
that place restricted to the one single Congregation, supposed to meet all in
one house at one time in Corinth, because it is a shame for a Woman to preach
in all the Churches of the World, as is clear, 1 Timothy 2, 11, 12. and Exodus 12.
47. all the Church, ((...)) of Israel shall do it, that is, they shall eat
the Lamb in their Houses, and shall not break a bone thereof, so the 70.
Interpreters render it, (...), The Chaldee paraphrast, Omnis caetus Israel
faciet illud. It were easy to b^ing infinite instances out of the Word of God
70. Interpreters Chaldee para.
to make good that a collective, noun such as (...), and (...), a Church, is
taken distributively. So James 2. 2. if toere came unto your assembly, (...), a
man with a gold Ring, etc. Except the word (assembly) or, Church, be taken
distributively and not collectively, it shall follow that all the dispersed
Jews, to whom James does write, have one single place of Church-assembly, as
Heb. 10. 25. not forsaking (...), the assembly of your selves together, a^ the
manner of some is; but can any infer from this place, more then from Acts 11.
26. Acts. 15. 35. that all the whole Hebrews, to whom that Apostle does write
had one ((...)) single Church-meeting, and one Congregation, in the which they
did all meet for worship? I think not: or will it follow that there were none
amongst all these Jews who did separate from any Church-assemblie, except
only from the Church-assembly of a single Congregation, because the Apostle
mentions only one single Church-meeting? I think not, and therefore the
Apostles mentioning of one assembling of the Church, acts 11. 26. and of one
multitude, in the singular number, acts 15. 30. can never prove that there was
but one single Congregation at Antioch. Therefore there be great ^dds betwixt
meeting in a Church, and meeting in the Church.

Also Tit. 1. 5. for this cause was Titus left at Creet, that he might appaynt
Elders (...), in every City, if (...) be not all one with (...), Acts 14. 23.
acts 16. 4. 5. That is, if ordaining of Elders of every City, be not as good,
as ordaining of Elders in every Church, then must there be but in all, and
every City, where ever the Apostles or Evangelists planted Churches, but one
single Congregation, and not any more then could meet in a single Congregation;
which is a conjecture, and much contrary to these times when the Gospel
admirably grew in the World. And it must follow that every City had but such a
competent number as met in one place; and if this hold, as an uncertain thing,
in great Cities, then must we say an Eldership in a City, and an Eldership of
many Congregations were the first planted apostolic Churches, and so rules to
us also. And look what frame of Churches the Apostles did institute in Cities,
that same they behoved to institute in Villages also, for places cannot change
the frame of any institution of Christ. 2. The communion of Saints and
Church-edification is as requisite for Villages, as for Cities.

Arguments removed, which Mr. Richard Mather, and Mr. William Thomson Pastors
in New England, in their answer to Mr. Charles Herle, do bring, so far as they
make against the authors former Treatises, and a scanning of some Synodicall
propositions of the Churches of N. England.

MR. Mather, Mr. Thomson, c. 1. 9. Governing power is only in the Elders, 1
Cor. 12. 28. Romans 12. 8. Heb. 13. 17. the people has no power but rather a
liberty or privilege, which when it is exercised about Ordination, Deposition,
Excommunication, is of the whole communiter, or in general, but not of all and
every member in particular; Women for their Sex, children for want of
discr^tion are d^barred.

Answ. If there be no governing power in Women, nor any act at all in
excommunication. You loose many arguments that you bring, 1 Cor. 5. to prove
that all have hand in excommunication. 1. Because Paul writes to all. 2. All
were to mourn. 3. All ware to forbear the company of the excommunicated men.
Then belike Paul writes not to all Saints at Corinth, not to Women, and Women
were not to mourn for the scandal; nor to forbear his company. 2. The
privilege being a part of liberty purchased by Christ's Body, it must be due to
Women, for the liberty wherewith Christ has made Women free cannot be taken
away by any Law of God from their Sex, except in Christ Jesus there be
difference betwixt Jew and Gentile, male and female; nor is it removed because
i^ i^ a power or authority, for the authors say it is no power, but a
privilege. 3. What privilege the people have in ordination to confer a
Ministry which they neither have formally, nor vertually, I know not. But I
do willingly say something here of the peoples power; The first Synodicall
proposition of New England, is.

1. Propos. The fraternity is the first Subject of all Ministerial power,
radicaliter, idest (...) per modum collationis, some say suppletive, non
habitualiter, non actualit ^r, non formaliter.

That is, (if I conceive it right) The people void of all Officers have a
vertuall power to confer a Ministry on their Officers though they have not
this power in themselves. I could in some sense yield that Believers not
Angels, are capable of the Ministerial power to exercise it formally, but
that Believers do, or can, by any way of causative influence, make
Church Officers, I see not: they may design a man qualified to bean Officer to
the Office, and that is all. But say they, people wanting, or being naked and
without all Officers has not formally or habitually any power in them, this
latter part Igrant, and the

2. Proposition I grant, to wit.

That the presbytery is the first subject of all presbyteriall power
habitually, and formally. But I do not see how it stands with the third
proposition; which is

3. The fraternity or the people without the Officers, and without Women or
children, have an authoritative concurrence with the presbytery, in judicial
acts.

Because if the Brethren have an half Ministerial power with the Officers in
acts of Jurisdiction and Excommunication, Deposition, and Censures, I see not
how there is not a Ministerial power formally and habitually, at least in
part, in the Brethren; and so contrary to the third proposition, the Prasbytery
is not the first subject of all Prebyteriall power, for the brethren are
sharers with the Elders in this power. 2. We desire to see it made good by Gods
Word, that the brethren have a joint power of Jurisdiction with the Elders, for
the Table gives them a brotherly public power not by way of Charity, but a
politic Church power, in many eminent acts, especially in those eight; and
that constantly,

1. In the admission. 1. In Sending Messengers to the Churches. 2. In the
excommunication of members. 2. 2. In interpretation of Scripture. 3. In the
calling. 3. In a judicial determination of controversies of Religion in a
synod. 4. And Deposition of Ministers. 4. In a power of disposing of things
indifferent.

I cannot see any judicial power, or any farther then a charitative yielding
by way of a loving and brotherly consent, that the Scripture gives to
brethren. 3. How this can be denied to be a power of jurisdiction and
governing; and an actual Ministerial using of the Keys of the Kingdom by
those who ex officio, by place, and calling are no Officers, I believe is not
easily understood. 4. The letter that I saw says, that that learned and godly
Divine Mr. Cotton and some others think, that the Church as it is an
Organicall Body made up of Elders, and people is the first subject of all
Ecclesiastical power, and they divide it into a power of authority, and a
power of liberty, whereof the power of authority belongs to the Elders or
Eldership, and the power of liberty to the Fraternity, or Brethren that are not
Officers; and therefore these reverend brethren deny any authoritative
concurrence to the brethren, and they think that the Church as it is an
homogeneall body, that is, a company destitute of Officers, cannot formally
ordain, excommunicate, or censure the Elders, though in case of obstinacy they
may do that which is equivalent, and so separate from them.

The 4. Proposition is;

The fraternity or Brethren in an Organicall Body, or in a ^^med and
established Church consisting of Officers and people, act and use their
authority, subordinate per modum obedi nt^ae, subordinately, and by way of due
obedience to the Elders, 2 C^r. 10. 6.

But I desire a word of Christ's Testament for this, where we a^de that
collateral Judges acting as Judges do act by way of obedience and subjection
one to another: for if the brethren, 1 Cor. 5. convened in Court with the
Elders to deliver the incestuous man to Satan, do act in that Court as giving
obedience to the Elders, I see not how they concur authoritatively is sharers
with them of that same Ministerial power: if it be said, brethren though they
act as Judges in excommunicating, yet they remain brethren and a part of the
flock, and so in all their moral acts of authoritative concurring with the
Elders, they are under the pastoral care of these who watch for Souls, and so
they judge and act even in the Court as under subjection to their watchmen, who
must give an account for their Souls; I answer, so the Elders in their acts of
the most supreme Ministerial authority and acting in a Church. court, leave
not off to be brethren and a part of the flock of Christ, and so in subjection
one to another; for six Elders watch for the Soul of one, and one also for the
Souls of six, and so if this were a good reason the Elders should act with
subordination of obedience to Elders. As the people act with subordination to
the Elders. 2. The place cited for this 2 Cor. 10. 6. where it is said, that
the Preachers have in readiness to revenge all disobedience, must infer that
they are to revenge, by the word which is mighty through God to cast down
strong holds, as is said there, v. 4. 5. even disobedience of Elders ruling
unjustly and abusing the Keys, no less then disobedience of the people. And I
see not how brethen acting in a Church-Court jointly with Elders, how in that
they put on the relation of the flock, and the part governed in the very act of
exercising acts of governing, for otherwise one Pastor in the act of preaching
in the Name of Jesus Christ, and so in authority above these to whom he
preaches, does preach subordinate, and as in subjection to the whole
organicall and formed Church, who has power to censure him, if he preach
erroneous Doctrine. 3. I see not how the third Proposition does stand, to wit,
that the brethren, share with the Elders in authoritative acts of the Keys,
and yet they ^ct (according to the. 4. Proposition) as under the Eldership by
way of subjection and obedience to them. Except this be that which our brethren
mean, that the people of a single Congregation exercise acts of Jurisdiction
by way of dependence, so as they may be censured by the Elders if they err,
but the Elders if they err, are every way Popes, and so independent; that
there is no Church Power on Earth above them, that in a Church Way may censure
them, or call them to an account. 4. The Table of New England divides the
actual exercise of the power in a Charitative power by way of Love and
Charity, and a politic or Church-exercise, the politic exercise again is
either brotherly, fraternall, or Presbyteriall,

and the presbyteriall exercise is either 1. Teaching. or, 2. Governing.

And Teaching is either by way of Office, or Administrating the Sacraments.

The Presbyteriall exercise of the Keys is independentElders, in the power of
governing, sed respect^ apotelesmatis s^u complementi censurae, in respect of
the effect, or a complete act of governing, the Elders Rule and Act with
dependence upon

the people, in these four cases 1. In excommunication. 2. In judging. 3. In
sentencing the aocused. 4. In election or (...), in calling of a Minister.

So that the Elders there alone without the people, can exercise none of these
acts completely, without the people so hear the Elders depend upon the people
in their actual governing, and the Fraternity or Brethren depend on the Elders
by way of subjection, or obedience to them.

Yet give me leave, the letter informs me that it is said by many learned and
godly men in New England, that if their policy should make the government of
the Church popular, they should give up the cause. But I conceive the
government to be popular, though the people only be not governors, for
Mor^llius never taught any such thing; now this government makes Elders and
people to govern the Church jointly with mutual dependence one upon another,
which certainly makes the brethren in the Lord, as well as the Elders; for if
the Elders be not these only which watch for the peoples Souls as these which
must give an account Heb. 13. 17, 18. and they be not only (...) over the
people in the Lord, as is said 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. 13. Then the brethren must be
taken in with them a^ joint governors, as is said Propos. 3. Which certainly
must confound the Scripturall order established by God betwixt the Pastors and
the Flock, the Watchmen, and the City, the shep^eards and the flock, these who
are to obey, and these who are over them in the Lord.

The 5. and 6. Proposition is, The Brethren may not excommunicate an Elder but
mediante concilio, by the intervening sentence of the Elders; is, but the
brethren may separate and withdraw from the Presbyteris, after they refuse
sound advise.

Answ. 1. This is much contrary to that which they ordinarily teach, to wit,
that people destitute of Officers may ordain and excommunicate their Officers.
2. By this learning the Souls of Elders are in an hard case, for when they do
all scandalously (...), there is no Ecclesiastical mean of edifying them, for
there is no Church on Earth to excomunicate Elders when they ^^re. Separation
from them is an unwarrantable way, except they be excommunicated. 3. In the
case of the Elderships incorrigible scandalls, the power of excommunication
retireth into the brethren. yet it was never formally in the brethren, nor can
they exercise this power, but mediante Presbyteri^, that is, they cannot
excommunicate the Eldership, but by the Judicial sentence of the Eldership,
and so the power is but a shadow.

Mr. Mather, Mr. Thomson, cap. 2. page 16, 17. though some have appealed, as
Luther and Cranmer from the Pope to a general council. Yet not from a
Congreation to a general council.

Answ. In matters doctrinall, some as Luther and others have justly appealed
from a Congregation, to a general council, though Luther and Cranmer did it
not; though verily I profess I cannot see what power of Jurisdiction to
censure scandalls can be in a general council, there may be some merely
Doctrinall power, if such a council could be had, and that is all.

M. Mather, Mr. Thomson, c. 2. page: 20. if Churches be dependent on Synods,
because the light of nature teaches a communion and assistance in government,
by the same reason Churches must end in a Monarchy on Earth.

Answ. I see this said, without any probation. Churches depend on many above
them for unity; but what consequence is this; Ergo, they depend upon one
visible Monarch. It is an unjust consequence.

Mr. Mather, Mr. Thomson, c. 2, page 26. The Graecians and Hebrews made not
two Churches, but one Congregation, they called the multitude of Disciples
together, v. 2.

Answ. That the chief of both Grecians and Hebrews were convened in one to
give their consent to the admission of their Officers the Deacons, I conceive;
but that all the thousands of the Church of Jerusalem were here, as in one
ordinary Congregation I judge unpossible.

Mr. Mather, c. 3. page 27. 28. If your argument be good, if thy Brother offend
and refuse to submit tell the Church, because Christ's Remedy must be as large
as the Disease: then if a National Church offend, you are to complain to a
higher Church above a National Church; and because offenses may arise betwixt
Christians and Indians, you may complain of an Indian to the Church.

Ans. Because ordinary communion fails, when you got higher then a National
Church, and Christ's way suppoleth an ordinary Communion, as is clear. If thy
Brother offend, etc. Therefore I deny that this remedy is needful in any
Church above a National Church. 2. Christ's remedy is a Church. remedy for
Offenses amongst brethren, and Members of the visible Church. And Indians are
no Members of the Church, and so being without, they cannot be judged, 1 Co.
5. 12.

We say that if the Magistrate be an enemy to Religion, may not the Church
without him convene and renew a Covenant with God? Mr. Mather, and Mr. Thomson
answer, c. 3. page 29. if the supreme Magistrate be an enemy to Religion, it
is not like, but most or many of the people will be of the same mind. Regis ad
exemplum -- as it is in France, and Spain, and was in the days of Queen
Mary, and then the Believers in the Land will not be able to bear the name of
the Land or Nation, but of a small part thereof; nor can it be well conceived
how they should assemble in a National Synod, for that, or any other purpose,
when the Magistrate is a professed Enemy, nor does God require it at their
hands.

Answ. This is a weak answer: the Christians under Ner^ were not like their
Prince, and its not like but sincere Christians will be sincere Christians and
profess truth. even when the Magistrate is an enemy. And 2. If your meaning
be, it cannot be conceived how they should assemble in a National assembly
when the Magistrate is an Enemy; because it is not safe for fear of
persecution. Then you say nothing to the argument, because the argument is
drawn from a duty, a Nation professing the Gospel after many backslidings are
obliged to convene in a National Synod, and are to renew their Covenant with
the Lord, and your answer is from an ill of affliction: and if you mean that
because the Princes power is against their Synodicall convening, this is
nothing against the power of the Synods that CHRIST has given to His Church;
But if your meaning be that it is not lawful to them to convene in a National
Synod to renew a Covenant with GOD against the supreme Magistrates will, I
hope you mind no such things; for so do Malignants The. Fuller, truth
maintained page 26 27, 28.
Now allege that we never read of any Reformation of Religion in Scripture
warranted, but where the Prince did contribute his authority, because he only
is to reform, and he only rebuked for the standing of the high places, but
he may soon be answered.

1. Both Israel and Judah were so bent to backsliding, that we read not that
ever the people made any real Reformation of Religion, Josiah, Hezekiah and
Asa did it for them. But what an argument is this: Judah did never, for the
most of the Land, seek the Lord God of their Fathers with all their heart;
Ergo, the seeking of the Lord God with all the heart is an unwritten tradition?

2. Princes are obliged to remove high places; But are they obliged with their
own Hands to break all the Images? No, I think if they remove the high
places by the Hands of their Subjects, or command their Subjects to remove
them, they do full well. But I see not this consequence. Ergo, Princes only
are obliged to remove the high places, it follows not.

3. If it be the Princes part to command his Subjects this duty of Reformation
and removal of the high places, then they may perform their duty without the
Prince.

4. There is a twofold Reformation, one an heart-Reformation. Sure this is not
the Princes only. All the Land may repent without the King. There is another,
an outward Reformation. And that is twofold, either Negative, or Positive^
Negative is to refrain from ill, and the unlawful and superstitious manner of
worshipping GOD, as in new Offices not warranted by his Word, Antichristian
Ceremonies, and a Masse-Booke, etc. Certainly all the Land are to abstain from
sin, though the King command not: now all the Reformation for the most part
in both Kingdoms is in obstinence from superstitious superadditions that
defiled the worship of GOD, and to this there is no necessity of the
Magistrates authority, more then we need^ the Kings warrant, to put an
Obligation upon Gods Negative Commandments. All that is Positive is the
swearing of a lawful Covenant to observe and stand by the faith and true
Religion of the Land, but I see no more a necessity that a King warrant the
lawful Vow of twenty thousand, then the Lawful Vow of one Man, seeing it is a
lawful profession of CHRIST before Men commanded in the third Commandment.
And to the observance of that Law of God, which God and Conscience hic and nunc
do oblige us, there is no addition of a Kingly authority by necessity of a
Divine Law required to make it valid, no more then if all the Kingdom at such
a solemn day of humiliation, should all in every several Church swear to
Reformation of life.

5. The Apostles and Christ positively did reform Religion, and the Church
without and contrary to the mind of civil authority, nor is it enough to say
the Apostles were Apostles, but we are not Apostles, for upon this moral
ground, Acts 5. 29. We ought rather to obey GOD than man,) they reformed
contrary to the Magistrates mind. And we do but contend for that very same
Faith, Jud. 3. which was once delivered to the Saints. So to Reform is to
seek the old way, and to walks in it, Jeremy 6. 16. to turn to the LORD with
all the heart, Jeremy 1. and for this cause, Jeremy 3. 10. Judah is said not to
veturue to the LORD with her whole heart, but fainedly, because when a zealous
King reformed, them they returned not with all their heart. Whence Reformation
of Religion must be the peoples duty, no less then the Kings; and I believe
such a divine precept carrying the new sense of our Malignant Divines should
be black policy, not sound Divinity, if any Ierimiah or Prophet should say;
amend your ways and turn to the LORD with all your heart, and put away your
Idols and your strange Gods, providing the King will go before you, and
command you so to do. Hence I say that is a poor Court-argument of Parasites
for Kings. We never read of any Reformation of Religion in Israel and Judah
but when holy and zealous Kings commanded the Reformation; Ergo, the
Reformation begun in Scotland without the consent of the Supreme Magistrate,
and a Reformation now prosecuted in England against the Kings will is
unlawful. To which. I desire the Malignant Divines to receive these answers
for Justifying the zeal of both Kingdoms in their Reformation.

1. It is a question, if they question not the Reformation according to the
substance of the action, that is, if they are not offended that the Queens
Mass, the popery of Prelates and Divines under their wings, and their
Arminianisme, and Socinianisme should be abolished, or if they condemn not the
Doctrine, but question only the manner of abolishing such Heterodox stuff. If
the former be said, i^ is known, never Malignant, Prelate or other had grace,
by Word, or Writing, to entreat his Majesty for a Reformation, and this is
enough for the former. If they mean the latter, they be very like the
Pharisees, who when they durst not question the Doctrine and Miracles of
Christ, they only questioned the manner of doing. And said by what authority
do thou these? But because they are joined to the Papists side, and fight
under their banner; It is most evident it galleth their stomachs, that Popery,
Atminianisine, and Socinianisme are cried down; else the manner of doing a
good work, and such a necessary work as Reformation, would not have offended
them so highly, as to move them to kill the people of GOD; an error in the
circumstances of a good work is very venial to Papists and Arminians.

2. Let them give to us, since they argue from a practice, a warrant of any
such practice, where a whole Land went on in a Negative Reformation without the
Prince Ergo, Negative precepts, by this logic, shall lay no divine obligation
on us, except it be the Kings will to forbid that which GOD forbids, then
suppose Episcopacy and the Ceremonies were the Idol of the Mass established
by a standing Law, it should be unlawful for the Kingdoms to forbear and
abstain from Idolatry, except the Kings Law forbid Idolatry. What were this
else but to say, we are obliged to obey Christ's will, but not except with a
Reservation of the Kings will?

3. This is an argument Negative, from one particular in Scripture, and
therefore not concludent. For it is thus, Reformation without the King wants
a practice in the Sc^ipture; Ergo, it is unlawful, it follows not, except it
want Precept, Promise and Practice, for the argument Negative from Scripture is
only undeniable in this sense; And in this sense only pressed by our Divines
against Papists. And therefore it is like this argument, Purgatory is not
commanded in this Chapter, Idolatry is not forbi^den in this Commandment,
Ergo, neither Purgatory, nor Idolatry is forbidden in Gods Word. So let the
adversaries give me a practice in the Word of God, where a Brother kept this
order of Christ's three Steps, Mat. 18.

First, to reprove an offender alone.

Secondly, before two or three witnesses.

Thirdly, in case of obstinacy, to tell the Church; and to these add, that the
man was by the Church to be reputed as an heathen and a Publican. And I hope,
because such a practice we do not read, yet it follows not that it is
unlawful. So where read you a Man forgiving his Brother seventy seven times:
Ergo, it is unlawful to forgive him seventy and seven times? Where read you
that Christ and His Apostles, and the Christian Church in the New Testament
raised War and Armies either to defend or offend, but I hope Anabaptists have
not hence ground to infer, then must all Wars be unlawful to Christians,
for we can produce warrantable precepts, where we want practice.

Fourthly, where it is said, Kings only are rebuked for not removing high
places, and Kings only are commended, because they are removed, therefore none
should reform but Kings. This follows no ways, but only Kings by Royal
authority should reform; but it follows not; Ergo, the people without the
King are not obliged to reform themselves in their manner, for I am sure, that
the people should all universally resolve and agree, never to sacrifice in the
high places and accordingly to practice: And to sacrifice only in the place
which the Lord had chosen to place His Name there, at GODS express Law
commanded, Deuteronomy 13. 23. Deuteronomy 12. 14. 18. Deuteronomy 16. 2. 7.
11. 15. Deuteronomy. 31. 11. had been a removal of the high places and a warrantable
Reformation, though the King should have, by a standing Law, commanded that
they should sacrifice in the high places, for the people are rebuked, because 2
Kings 17. 11. They burnt Incense in all the high places, 2 Chronicles 33. 17.
Hosea 4. 13. and, a Chronicles 20. 33. the reason why the high places were not
taken away, is: For as yet the people had not prepared their Hearts unto the
GOD of their Fathers. If then not Sacrificing in the high places was the
peoples duty, they were to remove the high places, in their place; and so far
to reform without the KING, yea suppose the KING command the contrary, the
people ought to obey GOD, and the Parliament may by GODS Law abolish
Episcopacy, popish Ceremonics, and the popish Service though the KING consent
not, upon this ground that those he the high places of England, for the which
the Wrath of the Lord is kindled against the Land.

Fifthly, the adversaries may read, 2 Chronicles 15. 9. That the Strangers out
of Ephraim, and Manasseh and Simeon gathered themselves together to Asa without
the consent of their KING, and did enter in a Covenant to seek the Lord God of
their Fathers.

Sixthly, the Pastors of the Land are obliged to preach all necessary truth,
without the KING, and accordingly are to practice what they preach; now
Reformation is a most necessary truth, they are then to reform themselves and
Religion without the KING: for the Word of GOD, not the KINGS will is the
Pastors rule in preaching, and he is to separate the precious from the vile,
that he may be as Gods Mouth, Jeremy 15. 19. and Ezekiel 2. 7. Thou shall
speak my words unto them, that was the Doctrine of Reformation, not the KINGS
words, verse. 8. But, thou son of man, hear what I say to thee; yea Pastors
are to preach against Kings and their sins, 1 Kings 13. 1. 2. 3. Jer. 1. 18.
Ier. 26. 10, 11, 12.

Seventhly, if no Reformation can be without the KING, 1. People are not to
turn to the Lord, and repent them of the evil of their doings, and to prevent
the Babylonish captivity, or a worse judgment, except the KING will, and all
Religion and. 2. Church-worship must be resolved ultimately on the KINGS will
and pleasure: for if it be not the KINGS pleasure to reform, the people must
continue still where they were, and Scotland who contrary to the will and heart
of authority at our first Reformation put away the Mass and Popery, and
established Religion in sincerity, is greatly to be condemned. Luther had
authority against him, and the powers of the World, it was one point of
Reformation that John Baptist took up, against the Law of the Land to preach
against Herod's sin; for if Popery be in a Land, to leave Popery is a great
degree of Reformation, and if the people, without the Prince, may go on in the
greatest step of Reformation, why not also in the lesser? except you say the
people without the King, are not to abstain from the grossest Idolatry under
the Sun, which is to worship and adore the work of the Bakers hands.

Mr. Mather, Mr. Thomson. The name Church, 1 Cor. 14. 4, 5. 35. 26, 27. 28. is
plainly given to that company that did assemble and come together for
performance of spiritual duties, and for the exercise of spiritual gifts, as
Acts 14. C. 3. page 32.
27. Acts 11. 26. 15. 4. 22. 30. 1 Cor. 11. 18. 20 22. 23. 3. Ioh. 6. which
places do abundantly show that a company gathered together to one place is
called by the name Church, as Cenc^rea, Romans 16. 1. which could not contain
many Congregations, being but the prot of Corinth.

Answ. We seek no more, if it be called a Church which conveneth for
performance of spiritual duties: as some of your places do well prove; Ergo,
no assembly should have the name of Church, but such as assemble for Word and
Sacraments; this now you cannot affirm, and it follows not, the Church
spoken of Matthew 18. is not assembled to Word and Sacraments, But to bind and
loose on Earth. The meeting, 1 Cor. 5. 4. is not for Word and Sacraments, but
to deliver to Satan, for ought we can read, the word Church, Acts 14. 27. is
not an Assembly for Word and Sacraments; but to hear how God had opened the
doors of Faith to the Gentiles, and whether this was preaching of the Word and
receiving the Sacraments, or rather a matter that concerned the Apostles and
Elders that they might not think hard to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, I
leave to the judicious Reader; and if to be received of the Church, Acts 15. 4.
be a matter of word and Sacraments, let all judge. And if to lend a decree of a
Synod, Acts 15. 22. be the act of a Church assembled for word and Sacraments,
let the World judge: and therefore all these places do strongly confirm a
Presbytery assembled for acts of Jurisdiction, and matters that belong to many
Churches, as is most clear, Acts 14. 27. Acts 15. 4. Acts 15. 22. and seeing
we find the name (Church) given to a meeting assembled only for discipline
or things that concern many Churches, for any thing we can read or observe
from the word: as Acts 14. 27. Acts 15. 4 22. 30. Matthew 18. 17. and also the
word Church given to a meeting assembled for the word, 1 Cor. 14. 1 Cor. 11.
18. 20, 22, 23. Romans 16. 1. and not for acts of Jurisdiction for ought that we
can collect from the word. I beseech you, Brethren, why do we contend? if the
word Church, be a meeting of persons assembled to one place, for spiritual
duties, sometimes for word and Sacraments only, sometimes for acts of
Jurisdiction only, then is the word Church, by our brethrens argument taken
both for the Congregation, and for the Elders of one, or of diverse Churches;
and so we have our intent. And we desire our brethren to prove (which they
must prove, if they oppose our principles) that the word (Church) is never
taken for the Eldership only, in all the Word of God, but these places prove
the contrary, as I have shown. 2. Whereas our brethren say; a company gathered
into one place (which is nothing else but a Congregation) are called by the
name of a Church. I answer 1. Such a company is only called by the name of a
Church, as I have proved; for a company meeting for discipline only, Matthew
18. 17 1 Cor. 5. 4. is a Church also. 2. It is false that a company gathered in
one place are nothing else but a Congregation. As you take the word
(Congregation) for to you (Congregation) is an assembly of men and Women
meeting for word and Sacrament with the Elders of the Church, I appeal to the
judgment of our reverend brethren; If the Church, Mat. 18. 17. assembled to
bind and loose, if the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 4. (though the Text speak nothing of
the word (Church) assembled to deliver to Satan. If the Church assembled, Acts
14. 27. Acts 15. 2. to hear things which concerned the Apostles, and many
Churches, rather then one; If the multitude convened, Acts 15. 30. to hear the
decree of the Synod read, and if the Church of Apostles and Elders from Antiosh
and Jerusalem. Acts 15. 22. be a Congregation or a Congregationall Church
assembled for word and Sacraments, as the word Church is taken, Acts 11. 26. 1
Cor. 11 20, 22, 33.

Mr. Mather, and Mr. Thomson, Number. 8. 10. The children of Cap. 3. page ^^.
Ordination.
Israel which were not the Church of Officers laid on hands on the Levites,
therefore when a Church has no Elders the people may confer ordination, and
it is not to be tied to the Presbytery only. Hence other of our Brethren say,
ordination is but accidental to a Ministers calling, and may be wanting, if
the people shall choose, in the defect of Elders.

Answ. Here two points are to be discussed shortly. 1. If Ordination belong to
the People. 2. If Ordination to a certain stick be necessary, for certainly
the people do not call but to a certain flock. To the first I say; There is
not a place in all the Word of God where the people confer ordination to the
Pastors of the New Testament. Therefore our brethren flee to the Old Testament
to prove it from the Levites who received imposition of hands from the children
of Israel; but our brethren hold, that the calling of the Levites and of the
Pastors of the New Testament are different, as the Officers and Churches of the
Jewish and Christian Church are different. 2. Our brethren grant page 49. That
it wants all example in the New Testament that the people lay on hands. 3.
These who laid on hands on the Levite, Number. 8. were Elders and (our brethren
say,) It is like they were, but. 1. They did it not as Elders. 2. But as
representing the people, not as Elders civil, for that belonged to Aaron and
his sons, Levit. 8. else it will follow that where the Church Page 46.
has no Magistrate to lay on hands, the Church may do it. Nor did they lay on
hands as Ecclesiastical Elders, because what these which laid on hands did,
they did as from the Congregation for 1. These Levites were taken in stead of
the first borne of Israel and not in stead of the first borne of the Elders
only, Number. 3 40, 41. 2. They were presented to the Lord, as an offering of the
children of Israel, not of the Elders only. 3. When the multitude brought an
oblation, the Elders put their hands on the head of the sacrifice Levit. 4. 15.
in stead of all the multitude.

Answ. These who laid on hands, did it as a work peculiar to the Elders,
because the Elders were a part of the first borne, who by Office were Elders,
and in whose stead the Levites were assumed, Number. 3. 40. 41. else the Church of
Israel being a constituted Church before this time, wanted Officers, which is
against all truth. 2. We grant the Magistrates laid not on hands, but they who
laid on hands did it as Ecclesiastical Elders. And the reasons against this
conclude not. 1. The first reason concludes not because these who laid on
hands were the first borne, who by Office were Church men. 2. The other two
reasons prove nothing, for because these who laid on hands, did lay on hands as
representing the whole Congregation, alas it does no ways conclude that they
laid not on hands as it is a works peculiar to them as Elders, for the Priest
offered sacrifice first for his own sins, and then for the peoples, Heb. 7.
27. and so did represent the people. But, I hope, it follows not that
therefore the Priest did not sacrifice as a Priest, and by virtue of a peculiar
Office, but only as a principal member of the Congregation. 3. What if there
be no Elders in a single Congregation, as our brethren suppose there were no
Elders in Office in Israel to lay hands on the Levites? it will not follow
therefore, the people are to lay on hands, except there were no Elders in all
the Land or National Church to lay on hands. And though I think imposition of
hands not so essential perhaps as a Minister can be no Minister without it,
yet I think not so of Ordination (for these to me are as different as the
authoritative calling of a Minster, and a rite annexed to that calling) because
none can be a Minister in a constituted Church, but one which is called of God
as was Aaron. But you will say, in a Church, in an Island one may be a Pastor
without any ordination, if the people elect him, and there be no Elders to
ordain.

I answer, it is true: but so many Pastors send a Pastor to be a Pastor to a
Congregation, though that Congregation never choose him, as possibly they be
for the most part Popish, or unwilling, yet both Cases are extraordinary and
the Church not constituted and established.

M. Mather, if the people may elect Officers, then in some cases they may
ordain them! also, because ordination is less then I^ 46, 47.
election, and depends, upon it as a necessary antecedent, and it is nothing
but a^ consummation of election, or the admission of a person into the
possession of that Office, whereto he had right before by election. If then a
single Congregation may elect, which is the greater, they may ordain which is
the lesser.

Answ. Ordination is the more, and election the less; for ordination is an act
authoritative of the Presbytery, 1 Timothy 4. 14. and, for ought I see, the
authors might argue thus, the people may ordain; Ergo, they may preach and
baptize, for all the three are presbyteriall acts given to men in office. 2.
Some doubt if I said rightly in my former Treatise, that ordination is prior to
election, because ordination is that whereby a Minister is made a Minister, and
election that whereby he who is a Minister first by order of nature, is made
the Minister of such a fl^ck. I will not contend with any of either sides for
order. But when I said so, I took the word (election) for the peoples actual
receiving and their complete taking him for their Minister, after he is now
ordained a Minister this is his installing in his Office. And my reason is;
because the peoples naming of such a man to be their pastor does stand with
his never being their pastor; he being unwilling to be their pastor, and the
presbytery thinking it unfit he be the pastor of such a people. 2. The people
elect him as a pastor to be their pastor, they do not elect him as a gifted
man. And whereas some say. Acts 6. 3. 4, 5. Election of seven men to be Deacons
goes before ordination and imposition of hands, v. 6.

Answ. Election of the people goes before ordination in the relation of Luke,
true; Ergo, election is prior by order of nature, it follows not. But Acts 1.
Ordination of Matthias (God casting the lot upon him, verse. 25.) is prior to
the peoples electing of him, for the peoples appoynting of two, verse. 23.
cannot be their election; for they were to elect one, but I submit to the
learneder my thoughts in this. As also my tearming Paphnutius neither Bishop
nor Elder at the Council of Nice, which I did not as denying him to be a
Bishop, but because he was called to that Council of Nice where as before he
had been deprived, but was restored by Constantine, though in the estimation
of these who contended for the single life of Priests, whose corruptions
Paphnutius opposed, he was in an Ecclesiastical sense neither Bishop nor
Presbyter but deprived from both. But let the righteous rebuke me, and it
shall be as Oil to my Head. 3. It cannot be that election of the people is
the whole calling of a man to the Ministry, and Ordination only a supplement
and an consummatory rite, or a benedictory sign which may be spared. 1.
Because by the imposition of the bands of the Presbytery, Timothy was made a
Minister, 1 Timothy 4. 14. Paul and Silas separatted to preach to the Gentiles,
Acts 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. the Deacons ordained, Acts 6. 6. and this is enjoined with
the right manner of acting it to Timothy, 1 Timothy 5. 22. 2 Timothy 2. 2. as a
Ministerial act. 2. A Ministerial caling stands in an authoritative
sending, Romans 10. 15. and I see not well how the people themselves do send a
Minister to themselves. (3) The people have not either formally, or by any
grant of CHRIST, vertually, the Keys committed to them, how then can they give
the Keys to pastors? 4. People may as the Sheep of CHRIST, Ioh. 10. decern
His Voice, and so have a power of Election of their own pastors, nor does this
make good which our Brethren say.

Mr. Mather says, that because they are all taught of God, C. 5. page 51.
Esa. 54. 13. and they knew Christ's 'Doctrine, Joh: 7. therefore they may judge
of a Ministers fitness, for it is plain that there it a twofold knowledge;
one of Christians, Esal. 54. 13. not denied to Women and believing Children,
who cannot lay on hands nor ordain Ministers, as the presbytery does, 1
Timothy 4. 14. Acts 6. 6. Acts 13. 1 2. 3. 1 Timothy 5. 22. 2 Timothy 2. 2. but
for trying of Ministers if they be the sons of the Prophets and must be apt
to teach, 1 Timothy 3. 1, 2. able to convince subtle Heretics and gainsayers
and to put them to silence, Titus 1. 10. 11. there must be in a constituted
Church a College of pastors and prophets to try the prophets, with a
presbyteriall Cognizance.

But here some object. If Election be absolutely in the h^^ds of the people,
then is the peoples will, because will, the absolute determiner who shall be
the Pastor to such a flock; but people certainly may err, therefore the
Presbytery must be the last determiner in election; And people have only a
rational consent, and if their consent be irrational, the Presbyter must
choose for them.

I answer shortly in these propositions.

1 Pro. Neither is the People infallible in choosing, nor the Presbytery
infallible in regulating the peoples choice, yet is power of regulating the
choice, the presbyteries due, nor power of election to be denied to Gods people.

2. Pro. You must suppose the Church a settled and an established Church of
sound professors, for if the Congregation or presbytery, either of them be, for
the most part, popish, Arminian or unsound in the Faith, in so far has Christ
given neither power to the one, or other.

3. Prop. When it is acknowledged by both people and presbytery, that of two or
three men, any one is qualified for the place, then the man is absolutely to
be referred to the peoples choice, and though the people give no reason why
they choose this man, rather then any of the other two, yet i^ the Peoples
choice reasonable, for no doubt Acts. 6. there were more men then these seven
of good report and full of the Holy Ghost, and fit to be Deacons, therefore the
multitudes choice of these seven, and their nomination of them to be Apostles
rather then the nomination of any other men is rational and approved by the
twelve Apostles, though they give no reason; Yea, though Nicolas be the
S^ctmaster of the Nicolaitans (as the learned think) yet the election is
Ecclesiastically lawful and needs not that a reason be given to the Apostles.

4. Prop. We never read that in the Apostles-Church a man was obt^uded upon the
people against their will. And therefore Election by the people in the
Apostolic Church, as Acts 1. 26. Acts 6. 2, 3, 4. Revel. 2. 12. Acts 20. 28.
must be our rule, any election without the peoples consent must be no Election,
for if it please not the whole multitude, as Acts 6. 5. it is not a choice.

5. Prop. We must distinguish Election and Regulation of the Election.

2. There is a Regulation of the Election, positive; and a Regulation negative.
Hence the presbyteries power consists only in a negative regulation of the
peoples choice, not in a positive; For example, Election is an elicit act of
the people, and their birthright and privilege that Christ has given to them,
and it cannot be taken from them; if there be any Election, it must be made by
the people, the presbytery even in case of the peoples aberration cannot usurp
the act of Election; because the Apostles, who yet had the gift of discerning
spirits, in a greater measure then the multitude, remit the choice of the seven
Deacons to the multitude; Ergo, the presbytery should do the same; yet may the
presbytery negatively reggulate the Election, and if the people out of the
humor of itching ears choose an unfit man, in that case the presbytery may
declare the Election irregular and null; as suppose the multitude, Acts 6 had
chosen such a man, or all the seven men, like Simon Magus, the twelve Apostles
by their Ministerial power might have impeded that Election, or rather
nomination as irregular, and put them to choose other seven men; but the
Apostles could not have chosen for them other seven, for then Election should
have bin taken out of the peoples hands; Hence that distinction of elicit and
imperate acts, even as the understanding commands and directs the will to
such and such elicit. actions, and regulateth the will therein, and yet the
understanding can neither nill, nor will, and the King may punish pastors who
preach Heretical doct in and vitiate the Sacrament; but the King can neither
preach the word himself, nor administate the Sacraments; so the presbytery may
regulate negatively and hinderth Election of an unfit man, but the presbytery
cannot do, as the P^elate did who would name a man to the people, and desire
their consent (but consent is not all, the presbytery and neighbor
Congregations have consent, but no elective liberty given them by Christ) but
if the people refused their consent, he Prelate without more a do, chose and
ordained the man, and so he was obtruded on the people without any Election at
all.

Ordination of an ordinary pastor is always to a certain flock, Act. 20. 28. 1
Pet. 5. 1. Rev. 2. 1. yet here must we distinguished dedication to Christ's
service by the office. 2. The exercise of the office, in the former respect the
pastor is a pastor every where, and may be sent as a Pastor to plant Churches,
but ratione finis. He is primario principally to feed this flock, and
secundario and ratione med^i, secondarily, while he feeds this flock, he
feeds the Church universal.

Mr. Mather, if people may not m^dle with ordination, because it Ib. c. 59.
is proper to Timothy and Titus, this may prove that they were Bishops who did
ordain Elders there alone, which ministers may not do there; for these
Epistles are not written to them, as Bishops alone, nor as Elders alone, but as
to a mixed state, including the people.

Answ. Some parcells of these Epistles are written to Timothy and Titus as
Evangelists, such as none may now do but they only, ^^ 2 Timothy 4. 4. 1 Tit. 1.
3. Tim. 1. 5. and some other things which they gave in charge to Elders. 2.
Some things are written to them as Christians, as 1 Timothy 1. 19. Tit. 3. 3. and
finaliter or objectively all is written for the Churches good; but (3) the
builk of the Epistle is written to them as Elders, and is a rule of perpetual
government, and especially, 1 Timothy 1. 22. 2. Tim. 2. 2. for these and the like
they were to do with the presbytery, as is clear, 1 Timothy 1. 14.

Object. The Congregations of Jerusalem were not fixed in their members and
officers, only the Apostles preached to them (if they were many congregations,
which is possible) in a circular way, now one Apostle to this assembly, then
another. But in regard not one Paster could say (this is my flock, not this)
nor any flock could say (Peter is our Pastor, not Andrew.) Therefore there was
no Church State in any of these congregations as where there is not a head of a
Family and members, there is not a Family, and so you prove not Jerusalem a
presbyteriall Church over many fixed and formed Churches, as they are in
Scotland, and if the Apostles were pastors in a circular and fluid way to many
congregations, every one was a pastor to many congregations and so elected by
many congregations: which is absurd.

Ans. 1. Fixed or not fixed cannot vary the essence of the government. 1. The
Priests, Levites, and Prophets teaching in the wilderness from place to place,
and the people by war scattered to sundry Tribes, does not make these meetings
not to be under the government of the great Sanedrim, more then if the meeting
made a fixed Synagogue, diverse members and dverso heads in one Family
occasioned by death, and pestilence, diverse Soldiers and new Commanders in a
Regiment, diverse Inhabitants, yea and weekly altered rulers and watchmen in a
City, does not infer that that family, Regiment, and City is not under one
government of the City, one of the whole army, and one parliamentary law of the
whole kingdom; no more then if all were fixed in members and heads. 2.
Churches their persecution may have both members and teachers removed to a
corner, and altered, yet they remain the same single Congregation having the
same government. 3. Officiating in the same word, seals, censures, by Peter,
to day, and by Andrew, to morrow, though members also be changed, is of the
same species and nature, even to the worlds and, if we suppose the Church of
Jerusalem to be one Congregation enduring a pattern these sixteen hundred
years, members and officers must be often altered, yet it is one Congregation
in specie, and one single Church in nature, though not in number, and the
government not altered, through the fluidity and alteration of members and
officers, as it is the same Parliament now which was in the reign of King
James, though head and members be altered; fluidity and alteration of rulers
and members must be, by reason of mortality accidental to all incorporations,
and yet their government for all that does remain the same in nature, if these
same Laws, and Government in nature by these Laws remain.

CHAP. 4. SECT. 5.
Why we do not admit the Members of the Churches of Old England to The way of
Churches of Christ in New England.
the Seals of the Covenant.
Quest. I. Whether the Seals of the Covenant can be denied to professors of
approved piety, because they are not members of a particular visible Church, in
the New Testament.

Our Brethren deny any Church Communion, and the seals of the Covenant,
Baptism, to the children of Believers, the Lords Supper to believers
themselves, who come to them from Old England, because they be not members of
the particular Congregation to which they come, and because there is no
visible, Church in the New Testament, but one particular Parish, and all who
are without a particular Parish, are without the visible Church, and so are not
capable of either Church censures, or the Seals of the Covenant, because (...)
have right to the seals of the Covenant, but only this visible Church.

We hold all who profess faith in Christ, to be members of the visible Church,
though they be not members of a visible Congregation, and that the seals of
the Covenant should not be denied to them. And for more full clearing of the
question, let these considerations be observed.

First, Did. All believers, as believers, in foro Dei, before God have right
to the seals of the Covenant, these to whom the Covenant and body of the
Charter belongs, to these the seal belongs, but in foro Ecclesiastico, and
in an orderly Church Way, the seals are not to be conferred by the Church upon
persons because they believe, but because they profess their believing:
therefore the Apostles never baptized Pagans, but upon profession of their
faith.

Second Did. Faith in Christ truly gives right to the seals of the
Covenant, and in Gods intention and decree, called voluntas beneplaciti, they
belong only to the invisible Church, but the orderly way ^f the Churches
giving the seals, is, because such a society is a professing or visible
Church, and orderly giving of the seals according to Gods approving will,
called, voluntas signi and revelata, belongs to the visible Church.

Third Did. The Church may orderly and lawfully give the seals of the
Covenant to those to whom the Covenant and promises of grace does not belong in
Gods decree of election.

Fourth Did. The Church may lawfully add to the Church visible, such as God
adds not to the Church invisible, as they may add Simon Magus, and the
Church may lawfully cast out of the visible Church, such as Christ has not
cast out of the invisible Church, as the Church may excommunicate regenerate
persons for scandalous sins.

Fifth Did. Then the regenerate excommunicated have right to the seals of the
Covenant, as they have to the Covenant, and yet the Church does lawfully
debar them, hic and nunc, in such a scandalous case, from the seals of the
Covenant.

We hold that those who are not members of a particular Congregation, may
lawfully be admitted to the seals of the Covenant.

First, Because those to whom the promises are made, and profess the Covenant,
these should be baptized. But men of approved piety are such, though they be
not members of a particular Parish. The proposition is Peter's argument, Act. 2.
38.

Secondly, Those who are not Members of a particular Church may be visible
professors, and so members of a visible Church, Ergo, the seals of the
Covenant belongs to them.

Thirdly, The contrary opinion has no warrant in Gods Word.

Fourthly, The Apostles required no more of those whom they baptized, but
profession of belief, as Act. 10. 47. Can any forbid water that these should
not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, as well as we? Act. 8. 37.
If thou beleevest with all thy heart, thou may he baptized: no more is
sought of the Jailer, Act. 16. 31. 34.

The Author says: To admit to the Seals of the Covenant, is The way of the
Churches of New England, Chap. 4. Sect 5.
not an act of Christian liberty, that every Christian may dispense to whom he
pleases, but an act of Church power given to the Ministers, to dispense to
those over whom the Holy Ghost has made them overseers; but we have no
Ministerial power over those of another Congregation, and who are not members
of a particular Congregation.

Answ. First, To dispense the Seals to whom we please, as if men's pleasure
were a rule, were licentiousness, not Christian Liberty. There may be a
communion of benefits, where there is no communion of punishment: Beneficia
sunt amplianda.

Secondly, It is false that Pastors have no Ministerial power over those who
are not of their Congregation; for if so, all communion of Churches should
fall, for Letters of recommendation from other Churches, whereof they are
Members, cannot make Pastors of New England to have a Ministerial power over
those of another Congregation, as set over them, by the Holy Ghost, as they are
set over their own Parish, to whom they be only Pastors, having Ministerial
power, by a Church Covenant, and the peoples Ordination, as our Brethren teach.

2. Manuser. Those over whom (says our Author) we have no power of censure,
over those we have no power to dispense the communion. Now if we should censure
any such for drunkenness, or other scandals, who are not of our Congregation,
it should be a non habente potestatem, an act done by those who have no power.

Answ. The major proposition by your own Doctrine, is clearly false, for you
say your Chap. 6. Sect. 1.
self, Strangers sojourning with us, members of other Churches, known not to
be scandalous, are admitted to the Lords Supper; yet can you not excommunicate
strangers, sojourning for a time, falling in scandals. For,

First, to you they are without, how then can you judge them? as you say.

Secondly, You have by the holy Ghost no ministerial power over them, as over
your own flock, as you expone, Act. 20. 28.

Thirdly, You look aside at excommunication, for those of other Churches
consociated in a class, we do lawfully excommunicate and censure; for
excommunication is not a cutting off of a person from one single Parishionall
Church only, as you imagine, but a cutting off of a person from all the
visible Churches consociated: first, because he is delivered to Satan, and his
sin is bound in heaven, in relation to all the faster Churches, and is so to be
esteemed, and not in reference to the one single Congregation, whereof he is a
member. Secondly, all are to be humbled and mourn for his fall, and to consent
he be cut off, and not one single Congregation only. Thirdly, all consociated
Churches shall be leavened, by keeping Church Fellowship with such a lump.
Fourthly, all are to repute him as a Heathen, and a Publican. Fifthly, all are
to admonish him as a Brother, 2 Thessalon. 3. 15. Sixthly, all are to forgive
him, and receive him in Church Communion, if he shall repent, and occasionally
to edify him as a brother.

The Seals of righteousness of faith Manuser. ibid. 2.
says the Author) are not seals to the faithful as such, but as they are
joined together and consederate in some visible Church, none but in a visible
Church may dispense the seals, in the O^d Testament, none were partakers
either of the Passover, or of Circumcision, unless they were either
Israelites borne, or proselytes in the Church of Israel. We read not that Job
and his friends, though righteous through faith, were circumcised, nor would
they have omitted to speak of Circumcision, as of a pertinent evidence of the
corruption of man's nature, of which they speak much; the Sacraments (says
this same Author lb. Sect. 6.
are not given to the invisible Church, nor to the members thereof as such, but
to the visible particular Churches of Christ, and to the members thereof;
therefore the seals are not to be givento those, who are of no particular
visible Church?

Answ. 1. The Seals of the Covenant are principally given to the invisible
Church, as the Covenant it self in Gods decree of election is especially made
with the elect, and such as shall never fall away, as is clear, Jer. 31. 37.
Jer. 32. 40. Esaias 54 10. Heb. 8. 9. 10. and the invisible Church as such, as a
number of believers have only right before God to both Covenant and seals,
yea and consequently are only Christ's body and Spouse, and redeemed Saints,
and so only have all the power of the keys, and the ministerial power of
dispensing the Seals, and by our brethrens doctrine, the visible Church not as
visible, but as the true body, Spouse, and Bride of Christ, and so as the
invisible company of the redeemed ones have the Seals, and Covenant, and so
all Ministerial power of Christ is given unto them. 2. It is true the orderly
and Ecclesiasticke way of dispensing the Seals, is that they be dispensed
only to the visible Church, but this visible Church is not one parish, but all
professing the faith of Christ, though they be not joined in one visible parish
by one Church oath, as the Author means: for the Saints in Scripture, as
Cornelius, the Eunuch, the Jailer, did profess and visibly evidence their
faith, and so that they were capable of the Seals by desiring to be saved, and
saying, What shall we do to be saved, by trembling at the Word of God, by
asking the meaning of the Word of God, which expressions are in many not
in-churched to particular Congregations, not did the Apostles ask if they were
members of one parish before they baptized them, but if they believed in
Christ. 3. Whether Job, his friends, Melchisedeck, Lot, and others the like
were circumcised, we need not dispute, but that they were not circumcised,
because they were not in a visible Church estate with Abraham, is a question
and uncertain, and therefore not sure to be a foundation of new opinions in
Church Government; but though it were granted, it follows not, because none
were circumeised but Abraham's seed, and all, and only Abraham's seed were
circumcised, therefore none are to be baptized but those who are members of one
particular Congregation: Alas this is a weak^ consequence, rather it follows
all borne of Jews were circumcised, Ergo all borne of Christian parents are to
be baptized; and we see not but sacrificing was restricted to the visible
Church, no less then Circumcision, yet Job sacrificed to God, Job 1. and Chap.
42.

The Author adds The difference here is. The circumcised in Israel might
rightly keep the Passover amongst themselves, because the whole nation of
Israel made but one Church, and the officers and ministers of any one Synagogue
and the Priests and Levites were ministers in ^^mmune of the whole house of
Israel, in proportion whereunto they that are baptized in any particular Church
may in like manner require the Lords Supper, if there be no other impediment,
in regard of their unfitness, to examine themselves, which is a thing
requisite, to receive the Lords Supper, more then was required to receive the
Passover. But now because the Churches of the new Testament are of another
constitution, then the national Church of all Israel, baptism in one Church
does not give a man right to the Lords Supper in another, unless the Officers
of the one Church were Officers of all (as in Israel they ^er^) or unless that
one Church and the Officers thereof did recommend their right and power to
another.

Answ. 1. It is true, in the one Church of Israel there was something typical,
that is not in our Churches, as one Temple, ^^e high Priest, one place of
sacrificing, one Priesthood, one A^ke, etc. but this was peculiar to Israel, as
such a specifice Church, and typi^ied also the external visible unity of the
whole visible Church of the new Testament in professing one Lord, one Faith,
one Baptism, one external communion, and government external, de jure: but
this agreed not to the Church of Israel properly as a Church; for as a Church
of a nation they might convene and assemble themselves in one national
Assembly to reform Religion, to renew a national Covenant, to turn away a
national judgment, to make national acts, that they should seek the Lord
God of Israel, and put away strange wives, Deuteronomy. 29. 2 Chronicles. 15. 12, 13.
Nehem. 10. and this is moral, yea natural to a number of Churches united in
one nation, and no ways typical. 2. The proportion betwixt Israel and a
parishionall Church is questioned, the Author beggeth what is in question, for
it is evident that in Gods Word there is a visible Church of many
Congregations, associated in many visible acts of government. 3. If the Church
of Israel and the Churches of the New Testament be of different constitutions,
as Anabaptists, Arminians and Socinians teaches, we shall try. I affirm that
the Constitution in matter and form was one with the Christian visible Church.
1. Our brethren bring arguments from the constitution of the Church of the
Jews, that for matter they were a holy people, a royal generation, for form
they were united in one Church State Covenantwayes, as they prove from Deuteronomy.
29. 2. Separation from sin and the wicked world, but not from the worship of
God, was commanded to them, Psalm. 26. 5, 6. Esaias 52. 11. 2 Cor. 6. 7. Levit.
26. 11, 12. Communion with the wicked was forbidden to Israel, 2 Chronicles. 19. 2.
2 Chronicles. 30. 6. but communion in worship both in the Synagogue and Temple was
commanded to them. 3. That God required not moral preparation in them for
eating the Passover, as he does in us, before we eat the Lords Supper, I
conceive to be an untruth. 1. Because not to profane the holy things of God,
and not to take Gods Law in their mouth and to hate to be reformed, Psalm. 50.
16. not to sacrifice with bloody hands, Esa. 1. 11, 12, etc. Psalm. 50. 8, 9,
10. Esa 66. 1. was moral, and did bind and oblige the Jews as they do us,
and 2 Chronicles. 30. 6. The posts are sent to gather the people to the Passover,
charging them to turn to the Lord God of their fathers, not to be like their
fathers; and it is clear by Hezekiab^ prayer, ver. 18, 19. Good Lord pardon
him that prepares his heart to seek the Lord God of his fathers, though he be
not cleansed according to the purification of the Sanctuary, verse. 20. And the
Lord hearkened, and healed the people. Ergo, there was required a preparation
of the heart for the right eating of the Passover, besides the typical and
ceremonial preparation. Yea God counted the ceremonial preparation void of
the moral preparation, but abomination, as Esa. 66. 1. Esa. 58. 3, 4, 5, 6.
and Josiahs Passover is commended from this, 2 Kings 23. 22 (as Junius well
observes) that none did with such care and zeal, as Josiah did prepare the
Pr^es^s, the people and himself for the passover, in removing all Id^latry
and abominati^n, and in renewing their Covenant and resoluti^n, verse. 3. To
walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandments with all their heart, and
with all their soul. 4. The unclean and uncircumcised in heart were no more
members of the true and invisible Church of the Jews, and of Christ's mystical
body, his Spouse, his royal generation, then Sodom and Gomorrah, Esa. 1 10.
then the Ethiopians, Amos, 9. 7. then Ammon and Moah, J^r. 9 25, 26. as in the
New Testament, and the true invisible Church amongst them, as amongst us were
Kings and Priests unto God, Exodus 19. 5. 9. Psalm. 149. 1. as we are, 1 Pet. 2.
9, 10. Rev. 1. 5. 5. Amongst them no man could invade the Priests office, or
run unsent, no more then under the New Testament, Heb. 5. 4. 1 Timothy 4. 22.
though they were to rebuke one another, Levit. 19. and they had sacrifices for
sins of ignorance, Levit. 4. 27. 2. The place seems not to want difficulty,
how many sacrifices would men offer, how often, yea while they were going home
from Jerusalem (which was a long Journey to many) they might fall in these
sins of ignorance, and as Paget.
Master Paget notes there was no dispensation for this Law, yet when Abraham
traveled three days to Mount Moriah from Beersheba in the South, and some of
the Tribes Northward, would be als far distant, it would be seven days
journey to many; therefore the Text is, if be sin (...) in ignorance, or
through ignorance, that is, merely of ignorance, as when a man in drunkenness
killed a man, he shall offer a trespass offering for it, the Jews call it in
their Language (...) timgnol, magnal, for (...) megnal signifies Pallium, if
he sinned with a cloak (...)
casten over his eyes, and Weemes ^. par. c. 14. page 68.
Weemes said the sins were done of ignorance, not ignorantly, or the word in
the Hebrew, is vel notificatum fuerit ei peccatum ejus, when the conscience is
wakened and convinced, and he can find no rest, let him offer sacrifices. And
a third step was excommunication and casting out of the Synagogue after the
captivity, which are the very degrees of our Church censure. They answer,
Israel had civil Robinson Iustific. page 202, 203.
government which we have not. I answer, Deuteronomy. 17. 9. He that will not hearken
to the Priest (that stands before the Lord to minister) or unto the Judge,
even that man shall dye. He says not, He that hearkeneth not unto the People.
2. They say they could not in Israel forgive one another sins, as we do in
the New Testament.

Answ. It is a divine Law in the Old Testament, they were to forgive even their
enemies, Prove. 20. 22. etc. Robinson (...) P. 202, 203.
Robinson says, No Church has the absolute promise of the Lords visible
present, which that Church then had, till the coming of Christ, Genesis 47. 10.
and 17. 7. Exodus 19. 43, 44. It was simply necessary that the Messiah should be
borne in the true Church. 3. In their deepest apost asy God showed them some
signs of his presence, by raising up some godly King, Priest, or Prophet.

Answ. That they had Prerogatives above us is clear, Romans 3. 1, 2, 3. Romans 9.
4. and that in other respects, far more excellent, we have Prerogatives
above them, is as clear, 2 Cer. 3. 7, 8, 9. Matthew. 13. 16, 17. So one
Christian Church have Prerogatives above another, but the essential
constitution of the Church of the Jews, and ours is one. 1. They were a ro^a^d
Priesthood, a People holy to the Lord, the Covenant made with them, as with
us. 2. To them one little Leaven, leavened the whole lump. 3. Separation from
sin and Idolatrous worship was commanded them, as it is us. 4. Amongst them,
none who hated to be reformed, were to take the Law of God in their mouth. But
to return to our Author, it is a false ground that one that is Baptized in one
Church, has not right to the Lords Supper in all Churches, for if he be
Baptized to Christ's death, he is Baptized to all Churches. And 2. professedly
in Covenant with God in all Churches, and so has right to the seals of the
Covenant in all Churches, for Gods Covenant is not principally and first made
with a Parishionall Congregation, but with the Catholic and universal Church
coming under the name of Israel and Judah; and secondarily with a Parishionall
Congregation. Is a believer a member of Christ's body in one Congregation and
not in all Congregations? Has he the keys as a member of Christ's body, and a
dwelling house for the holy Spirit in one Congregation, and loses them and the
holy Spirit both when he goes to another Congregation?

Manuscript, Those who come from England to us are under public Manus^^ ^.
ibid.
scandals and reproach. It is an offense that they come to us, as members of no
particular Church visible, (for they leave that relatiin where they left their
habitation) but of one National Church, whereof Christ has given us no
pattern in the New Testament, and in (...) he has appointed no National
worship to be performed.

Answ. It is admirable that leaving a Parishionall Church in England, they
leave not the true visible Church, so all the Parishionall Churches in England
must be separated from, as ^^om no Churches; yet in that Church, many of you
had your Baptism, your conversion to Christ, your calling to the Mini^e^^. 2.
How can it be an offense to be Members of no independent Churches in England,
whereas no such may be had there? 3. Is it a fault to be members of a National
Church? see if Act. 1. Act. 6. Act. 15. there be not a Church-meeting, and
public exercise of praying, discussing of matters by the Word, choosing of
officers, refuting of false Doctrine? This is worship, and it is not the
worship of a particular Church, but there be no true Churches but yours, and
all are in offenses and scandalls, who are not members of your Churches; this
August lib. 2. c. 5, 6, 7. vos ergo, qua^e sacreliga separatione pacis vin^ulum
d^s^^^^pitis?
Augustine lays to Donatists, this Pareus com. in Matthew. 18.
Pareus lays upon Au^baptists, that they taught, they only were the true
Church. I conceive our dear Brethren are not of this mind.

Manuscript, It is a public offense, that though they were Baptized in some
Parish Church in England (says the Author) upon some Covenant and stipulation
of Parents, or Godfathers, which also was without warrant, yet they come to
the Lords Table, without any public profession of their faith or repentance?

Answ. To say nothing of Godfathers, who are civil witnesses, that the
Parents shall take care to educate the child, in the true Faith, we see no
public profession by a Church-oath, (as you mean) in the Church of Corinth,
but only that every man was to try himself, and then to eat, nor in the
Apostles Church at all, if you debar them from the Lords Supper, who are not
inchurched by your Oath, all the reformed Churches on Earth did never worthily
eat and drink the Lords body and blood. It is (says he) a public offense,
that in the Parish Manuscr.
Communion (which not Communion of spirits, but cohabitation begets) they
partake with all ignorant and scandalous persons, not excluding drunkards,
profane swearers, whereby it comes to pass that not a little leavin, but a
great measure of leavin does deeply leavin the whole lump.

Answ. This tolleration of drunkards and swearers in the Lords Church, and at
his Table, infecteth and is apt to leavin all, with their evil conversation,
but does not leavin the worship to the fellow-worshippers, nor is the sin of
private persons, yea nor of our Ministers, who has not power to help it, (but
it is the fault of the Church) except you make no separation from a Church
where a scandalous person is tolerated (for suffering more or sewer does not
vary the spece) to be a sin publickely to be repented, before any can be
members of your Church, which is prodigious to us.

Fourthly, It is a public offense (says the Author) that they have
worshipped God, according to the precepts of men, etc.

Answ. This is the crime of conformity which I wish were publickely repented,
by all which has defiled themselves with submitting to a Antichristian
government, and the Will Worship of men, yet does not this make Ministers no
Ministers, so as they must receive Ordination to the Ministry of new. Peter's
fall took not away his Apostleship, nor Jonah^ flying from God, nor David's
adultery made them not leave off to be Prophets.

Other arguments that I find in Papers from New England are these: First, There
is not a Church (say they) under the New Testament, but a Congregationall
Church, so it will follow, that as City privileges belong only to the
Citizens and their children, so baptism and the Lords Supper, being Church
privileges, belong only to the Members of particular Churches, and their
seed; and that seeing sigillum sequitur donum, to apply them to any other, is
to abuse them. As the scale of an Incorporation is abused, when it is added to
confirm a gift to one who is not a Free man of that Incorporation, he being
incapable thereof.

Answ. First, The case is not here, as in earthly Cities, a man who is a free
Citizen in one borough is not for that a free Citizen of all the Burroughes
and Cities on earth; nor is he who is civilly excommunicated and cast out of
his City privileges in one City, cast out of his City privileges in all other
Cities, whereof he is a free member: and the reason is, there is not one common
owner, and Lord of all the Cities on earth, who can give, or take away, in a
Law-way, City privileges; but the case is far otherwise in the privileges
of visible Churches, for he who is a member of one visible Congregation, is by
his baptism, and sincere profession, and his professed standing in Covenant
with God, a Member of all visible Congregations on earth, as he is baptized in
all Congregations on earth; and if he be excommunicated out of a single
Congregation, he is excommunicated out of all, and loses right to the Scale of
the Lords Supper, in all visible Congregations, as his sins are bound in
heaven to all also, for that one common head and Savior, who gives him right
to the Seals of Christ's body and blood in one, gives him right to these
Seals in all. For we worthily communicate with Christ in his body and blood,
(...) his body was broken, and his blood shed for one single visible
Congregation, but as broken and shed for the whole (...) universal. But this
form of reasoning utterly abolisheth all Communion of Churches, nor can a
member of one Noble Church be capable of the Seals of grace in another visible
Church, because he is not a Member of that visible Church, no more then one is
capable of the Privileges of Paris, who is only a Citizen of London, and not
a Citizen of Paris. If it be said, one who is a member of a visible Church, may
receive the Seals in another Congregation, if he be recommended by Letters, as
a sound Professor, to that other Congregation. I Answer, Recommendatory Letters
can never give a Church-right to the Church Priviledges of the Seals of the
Covenant, they do but only notify, manifest, and declare the Church-right,
which the man had before. Ergo, either he cannot in any sort be capable of the
Seals of the Covenant in another Congregation, then his own, whereof he is an
inchurched Member, which destroys all communion of sister Churches, or if he
be capable of the Seals in another Congregation, he was capable and h^d a
Church-right, in himself, before he received reconime^^a^ory Letters: yea,
these whom we recommend by Letters as ^it to partake of the Sacraments in
another Congregation, ^^ presuppose they have Church-right to the Seals in
another Congregation visible, then in their own, whereof they are members;
except our testimony be false. Ergo, before our recommendatory Letters, the
person of approved piety was a member of all the visible Churches about, hoc
ipso, and by that same reason, that he is a member of one visible Congregation;
yea Peter clearly insinuates that all who have received the Holy Ghost, are
to be baptized, Act. 8. 47. as Philip, Act. 8. 37. and That if the Eunuch
believed, be might be baptized. So that Faith, to speak properly, does give us
right to the Seals, and to speak accurately, a visible profession of faith
does not give a man right to the seals of grace, but only it does notify and
d clare to the Church, that the man has right to the seals because he
believes, and that the Church may lawfully give to him the seals, and that
profession is a condition required in the right receivers of the seals in an
Ecclesiastical way; but faith gives the right to these seals, and because
the faith of the believer goes with the believer, when he goes to another
visible congregation then his own, that faith gives him right to the seals
in all places, and in all Congregations: for faith gives right to receive
Christ Sacramentally, not in one Congregation only, but in all, and a visible
profession does, as a condition notify this faith, and Church-right in all
Congregations. Ergo, the man has right in all Congregations, as he has right
in a parishionall Church. But our Brethren reply, Peter might baptize
Cornelius, though he was no member of a visible Congregation, because the
Apostles being ^fficers in all Churches, might dispense the Seals in all
Churches: but Ministers now are pastors only of the determina^e flock, over
which the holy Ghost has set them, therefore they have not City Seals at
their power to dispense to any other then to Citizens.

Answ. Peter his argument to Baptize is not from a temporal reason, that
endures for a while, but from a moral argument of perpetual equity and
necessity, till Christ's second coming. He that believes and has received
the holy Ghost is to be baptized. But many out of Church State, and who are not
members of a particular Congregation, have received the Holy Ghost, and do
believe, being Christians of approved piety; we are to add no restrictions,
or exceptions where God adds none. Non est distinguendum, ubi lex non
distinguit. They that believe should receive the seals, but not except they be
in-Churched and members of a particular Congregation. The proposition is Gods
Word, but the restriction or exception is not Gods Word. 2. The Apostles,
though they were universal Pastors of the world, yet teach us by word and
practice, who are to be admitted to the seals, even to the supper, those who
do try and examine themselves, and that to the end of the world.

2. Our brethren say, It is probable that Cornelius was in Churchstate, and the
Eunuch coming to Jerusalem to worship, argues he was a proselyte, and a
member of the Jewish Church not yet dissolved; Lydia and the jailer were
members of the Church of Philippi, which Church communicated with Paul at the
beginning of the Gospel, Psalm. 4. 15. at least it is probable, that Lidia was a
member of the Church of the Jews.

Answ. It is hard to build a new Church government contrary to the doctrine of
the reformed Churches upon probabilities. 2. If Cornelius, Lydia and others
were members of the Jewish Church, it was not a good consequence by our
brethrens doctrine to make them members of a Christian Congregation, without
in-churching of them by your Church-oath, for you make the constitution of the
Jewish Church, and ours different; yea and as you teach, all circumcised were
members of the Jewish Church, and had right to their Passover, but all
circumcised are not meet to be members of a Christian Church, for many
circumcised were Idolaters, murderers, profane mo^ke^s of God, Esaias 1. 13,
14, 15, 16. Jer. 10. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Ezekiel, 10. 6. 17. 18, 9. And though the
Church of Philippi was one of the (...) Church (...) communicated with Paul,
yet was there no Christian Church of Elders and people there, when Lydia was
converted, for Acts 16. 13. in the place where prayer was wont to be made on
the Sabbath day, none heard Paul preach, but some women, Ergo there could not
be a Christian Church there; and it is certain the jailer before was a
persecutor, and no member of a Christian Church.

They say Abraham and his seed were not circumcised, till God called him into
Church Covenant, and so into Church State, and there is the same reason and use
of baptism, as of circumcision. If the argument taken for baptizing of infants
be good, why may we not inserre a necessity of Church Membership, before
baptism, as of Church membership before circumcision? So the Apology says.
It cannot be proved that Apology cap. 11.
baptism was imposed upon all believers, as such, no more then it can be
proved that circumcision was imposed upon all believers as such; and Baptism
is no more now necessary to a believer, whose calling or another strong hand of
Gods providence will not suffer to live in Church fellowship with Gods people,
then circumcision was necessary to Melchisede^k, Job or others, whom the hand
of God detained from Church Fellowship, with the posterity of Abraham; yea
circumcision and the Passover, seeing they were administrated in private
houses, might more conveniently be administrated to persons not in
Church State, nor Baptism and the Lords Supper can be administrated so, in
respect they are seals given to a Church body in an assembly, 1 Cor. 10. 17.
and 12. 13.

Answ. Abraham, Sarah, and the Souls they had gotten in Charran, were in
Church State, obeyed God, built an Altar Genesis 12. 2, 3, 4. before the Church
Covenant, which you speak of, Chap. 17. and it is denied that that supposed
oath of the Covenant made them a Church: So we see no necessity of
Church Membership, to one single Congregation, before either circumcision or
baptism; for baptism is a seal of our entry into the visible Church, as I
shall prove. 2. We say not that baptism is imposed on all who believes, as
they are such, for God saves diverse believers, who are not baptized, but Gods
will, the supreme I aw-giver, here is to be looked into, God would have no
circumcision from Adam to Abraham, and would himself have the people want
circumcision in the Wilderness forty years, and would have it administrated
in private houses, it being a bloody and painful Sacrament, but we have an
express Commandment of God to baptize all ordinarily of the visible Church;
yet not because they are members of one single Congregation, but because they
believe and testify themselves to be members of the visible Church in
general: we deny that the want of membership in a particular Congregation, is
that strong band that should hinder baptism or the seals of the Covenant. God
has appointed no lawful calling, such as traffiquing by Seas and ^equent
traveling ordinary to transient members of the visible Church, to be
inconsistent with the lawful partaking of the ordinances of grace, and seals
of the Covenant; for only those who do not try and examine themselves, and are
profanely scandalous are excluded, as swine, from the holy things of God, and
from the Lords Supper, not men, because they are necessarily busied in a
lawful calling, and must ordinarily travel to far countries, and so cannot
be members of a single parish. 1. This is a physical impediment and not a
sin, nor a moral impediment, excluding any from the Seals of grace, yea and
an unwritten tradition. 2. I speak against that difference which the author
makes, betwixt the seals of grace in the Old Testament, and the seals of
grace in the New Testament, for there were Physical and civil defects in the
Old Testament, which by a divine Law, made some incapable of the Passover, as
if any were Lepers, bastards, borne Moabites and Ammonites, or typically
unclean, or had touched the dead, they could not eat the Passover, though
otherwise they did believe in Christ to come, and were morally clean, but by
the contrary under the New Testament, there be no Physical or ceremonial
defects, no callings, no civil relations, but only moral defects, and
sinful scandals, which does exclude men from the Seals of grace, except you
bring in ceremonies in the New Testament, of your own devising, for all
Nations, so they believe in Christ, Jew, or Gentile, Barbarian, or Scythian,
bond or free, male or female, are to be baptized, Matthew. 28. 19. God is no
accepter of (...), or Nations, or callings, Act. 10. 34, 35. compare this with
ver. 46, 47. and Gal. 3. 27. For as many of you as have been baptized unto
Christ, have put on Christ, v. 28. There is neither Jew nor G^^ek there is
neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for (...) all me in
Christ Jesus, so Gal. 6. 15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision^ waileth
any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

I must then say, it is boldness in men to say, that there is a lawful
calling in the New Testament, which our Brethren are pleased to call the strong
hand of God, which makes persons who are new creatures, and baptized unto
Christ, incapable of the seals of grace. Dear Brethren, yield to the clear
and evident truth of God. And for this cause, the seals of the New Testament
must be more necessary in this respect, then were the Seals in the Old
Testament. Our Brethren say, All circumcised might eat the Passover (though I
doubt much of it) and might enter into the Temple, if they were not legally
unclean, but all baptized may not ca^e the Lords Supper; and all baptized,
though excommunicated, may enter into the congregation for the public
worship, hearing the word, praying, praising, etc. But all circumcised, might
not enter into the congregation. The places 1 Cor. 10. 17. and 12. 13. prove
not, that the Seals of grace are administrated to a Church body, of a
particular congregation only, as they are such; for these seals are common to
all the visible Churches on earth. We many are one body, it is not to be
exponed, We many are of one Parishionall Congregation, and only are one body;
but We many of all the visible Churches on Earth, are one body in Christ. This
you must say, except you deny all visible communion of sister Churches.

The Object. They who are not capable of Church censures, are not capable of
Church Privileges. But those that are not within the Church covenant of a
particular congregation, are not capable of Church censure. The proposition
being evident, the assumption is proved, 1 Cor. 5. 12. What have I to do to
judge those who are without, that is, without the communion of a particular
congregation, So Amesius, de consc. l. 4. c. 24. quest. 1. resp. ad.

Answ. First, I answered before, the major is false, by your own doctrine,
those of another Congregation cannot be censured, but by their own
congregation, yet by Letters of recommendation, they may receive the Lords
Supper in another Congregation. Also strangers of approved piety, may be
capable of Church rebukes, which are Church censures.

Secondly, The place, 1 Cor. 5. 12. is manifestly abused, for by those who are
without, are meant only the Insidels and Heathens who are without the whole
visible Church, and not those of approved piety, who are baptized and profess
the truth sincerely: for Peter Martyr, Beza, Calvin, Marlorat, Pareus,
Zwinglius, so also Haymo, Aquinas, expone it with us; which is clear, first,
by the phrase of speaking (What have I to do?) being a note of estrangement,
as, Joh. 2. 4. Woman what have I to do with thee? and 2 Samuel 16. 10. David
said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zerviah? now Paul and the
faithful at Corinth are not estranged from those of approved piety of other
Congregations, he took care to edify and rebuke them, and so are all the
Saints to edify, censure, and rebuke one another. Morton Ap^log. part 1 ^.
477. 478. f^r is sunt generaliter omnes, qui non dederunt sua nomina Christo:
Aug, tom. 1, ser^. 6, non tollo idola Ethnicorun, quia non habe^ in illos
potestate^ habe^ autem cum fuerin^ facti Christiani:


Thirdly, (...), always those who are without, are taken in an ill part, in
the Word of God, as Mark. 4. 11. Those who are without, are the blinded and
hardened, and Rev. 22. 15. for without are dogs, our Brethren expone it of the
visible Church. Now not to be in Membership of such a particular congregation,
is not a sin, nor a just ground of Paul's estrangement of his Ministerial power
from them, it may be caused by persecution when the flock are scattered by
Wolves.

Fourthly, Those who are here without, (...), are left by Paul to the immediate
judgment of God, and not to be judged of the Church, ver. 13. But them that
are without God judges. Now those who are members of another congregation then
the Church of Corinth, or members of no particular congregation, and yet of
approved piety, are not left to the immediate judgment of God, because they
are without. The banished servants of God, who suffer for the Truth, or
transient members, who because their calling is ordinarily traffiquing, and so
not consistent with a membership in a settled congregation, are they (I say)
without, not to be edified by the censures of the Church, but left to the
immediate judgment of God? this is contrary to Gods Word, and an insolent
interpretation, and I find i^ not in your place of Amesius.

They reason from inconveniences, Hence (say they) Church Apol. chapter 5.
assemblies shall be confused meetings, if all out of Church membership ^e
admitted.

Answ. If by confused meetings you mean, meetings of sound believers and
hypocrites, then Christ's Kingdom compared to a draw-net, wherein are good and
bad, are confused meetings and unlawful; which none can say but Anabaptists.
But if you mean meetings of these of your own Congregation and strangers of
approved piety, these are not confused meetings, but you beg what is in
question, and utterly abolish all Communion of Churches.

They add, the Church shall endanger the propbaning of the Seals, and want a
special means whereby their grace and piety shall be dis^erned, Apology.
if without respect of their Church estate, men be admitted to the seals; for
their own testimony is not enough: also how can they be of approved piety, who
against light refuse to profess subjection to the Gospel, by an orderly
joining themselves with some approved Church when they have opportunity? seeing
Church Fellowship is an action of piety required in the second Commandment,
and this mean of trial has been so blessed that many approved men have
been after trial found light to others, and to their own consciences.

Answ. Means of discovering sincerity or hypocrisy would be warranted by Gods
word, and means of eschewing the profaning of the Seals also. Simon Magus
was not so tried, yea when Peter found him in the gall of bitterness, we sinde
not that he cast him out of the visible Church in respect his sin was not
that publicly scandalous, as to offend the whole Church. 2. We grant that
strangers are not rashly to be admitted to the Seals, but you prove them not
to be of approved piety, because they will not swear your Church-oath, and
your discipline, as the only true way, and in so doing, you say they refuse
Church Fellowship commanded in the second Commandment; but this is to be
proved, and not to be nakedly averred by you; they believe, and can give
evidences of their belief, and so should by the word of God be admitted to the
Seals. Act. 10. 47. Act. 8. 37. Act. 16. 14, 15. ver. 31, 32, 33. 1 Cor. 11.
38. you deny them the Seals, as i^ they were dogs and unworthy prophaners of
the Seals only, because they cannot swear to your Church Government, which
you cannot prove from the word of God. 3. You deny them to be of approved piety
who will not join to an approved Church, you mean your own only. But you
add if they have opportunity, but what if they want opportunity, then the
strong hand of God deharreth them, and their seed from the Seals of Grace; now
if any be to traffic by Seas, and to travel to far Countries in a lawful
calling, he is legally unclean and incapable of the Seals to himself or his
seed; for he cannot in Conscience and through necessity of his lawful calling
swear your Church-oath, for he must swear to observe the manners of his
fellow members, to edify them by exhortation, consolation, rebuking, to join
himself in an eternal Covenant to that visible Church, yea never to remove
thence, except the Congregation consent: so your oath obliges him to all
these, now this is impossible because of his lawful calling, and because he
cannot be a Churchmember for ever: while he traffiqueth in his lawful
calling, the comfort of the Lords supper is denied to him, and Baptism to all
his seed, and that by a strong hand of providence without any fault in him:
show us a warrant from the Law and the Testimony, where any are to be debarred
from the Seals of the Covenant, and that ordinarily, (where sickness and some
other Physical impediments does not occur) where there is no moral
unworthiness or guiltiness in the persons debarred: Will you debar all from
Church-comforts, the presence of Christ in his Church, the comfort of his
walking, beside the Candlestickes, and his influence in the word Preached, the
power of the keys, the rebukes of the Saints, their exhortation and private
comforting of sinners, the comforts of the Ordinances of Baptism, and the
supper of the Lord, because a strong hand of providence in a lawful calling
does perpetually debar them? 4. You say your trying of Church Members is a
mean blessed of God, to try many men's sincerity.

I answer, Unlawful means, as the persecution of Tyrants, may have this
success, what then? is it a lawful mean? 2. I would Gods name were here
spared; it is not a mean blessed of God, it chaseth away many from the net of
the Gospel, and the Pastoral care of the Shepherds, and is not a conquering
way to gain Souls.

John Alasto (say they) in the days of Edward the sixth, would Apol. 7.
bapize none, but such as were members of that Church: and therefore p^^paned
this question to the Fathers, (Are these infants that you (...), the seed of
this our Church, that they may lawfully be Baplized?)

Answ. John Alasto had reason because of some present abuse, some indifferent
Atheists, infidels in heart, refused to join to either Churches, either
Protestant or Papists, and sought Baptismeto their children in either Churches,
as they might have it, and therefore was that question proponed to the Fathers,
but it proves not your point. Alasto excluded the Children of Atheists, who
would join to no Church, as his words cited bear. Ergo approved Christians
and their seed are to be excluded from the Seals of the Covenant. How weak
is your reasoning?

If the Rechabites (say they) the Posterity of Jethro, shall live in the ^idst
of the Commonwealth of Israel, and some of them prove true beleeters, as
Jonadab the son of Rechab. yet if they shall refuse to take bold of the
Covenant of Israel, and to become Pr^selytes, it is no sin for Israel to
withold the Passover from them, and circumcision from their Children?

Answ. You might have proved your point a nearer way, many legally unclean,
and yet sound believers, because of leprosy, for no sin were debarred from
the Seals amongst the Jews: but have you any law to debar any from the
Seals of the Covenant of grace under the New Testament, and that ordinarily
for no sin? 2. Calvin comment. in Jer. 35. 1, 2, 3 4.

Willet think it the lawful Vow of the Nazarites, commanded Numb. 6. What
then? If by Gods Law of the Nazarites, they abstained from wine, and the
Passover? God is above his own Law, Ergo, you may debar men from the Seals
under the New Testament for no sin; it does not follow. 3. How prove ye,
they abstained from the Passover? being so divine a Law, might not their Vow
suffer an exception for a greater Law in eating the Passover? I think it
might, for in case of necessity they came and dwelt at Jerusalem, for fear of
the Army of the Chaldeans, Jer. 35. 11. and yet their vow was to dwell in
Tents. From these arises,

Quest. I. If Pastors may perform Ministerial Acts in any other Congregation
than their own.

This is answered unto, by a Manuscript, If you take a Ministerial act
improperly, when a Minister does exercise his gift of praying and preaching,
being required so to do, so he may exercise some Ministerial acts, but this
he does not by virtue of any calling, but only by his gifts and occasionally:
but if you mean by a Ministerial act, an act of authority and power in
dispensing of Gods Ordinances, as a Minister does perform to the Church
whereunto he is called to be a Minister, then we deny that he can so perform
any Ministerial act, to any other Church, than his own.

Hence though he may preach to another congregation, yet may he not administer
the Sacraments to an other then to his own.

Answ. First, We hold that by a calling or ordination he is made a Pastor, by
election he is restricted to be Ordinarily the Pastor of his flock.

Secondly, A Pastor is a Pastor of the Catholic Church, but he is not a
Catholic Pastor of the Catholic Church, as were the Apostles.

Thirdly, The Reformed Churches may send Pastors to the Acosta d^ saint. (...),
l. 5. c. 17.
Indians, for that which Acosta says of Jesuits, we may with better reason
say it of our selves: That Pasiors are as Soldiers, and some soldiers are to
keep order, and remain in a certain place, others run up and don ne in all
places; So some are affixed to a Congregation, to feed them, others may be sent
to those people, who have not heard of the Gospel. Which sending is ordinary
and lawful, in respect of Pastors sending, and the Pastors who are sent,
because in Pastors, even after the Apostles be dead, there remains a general
Pastoral care for all the Churches of Christ. Thus sending is not ordinary,
but extraordinary, in respect of those to whom the Pastors are sent, yet is it
a Pastoral sending.

This opinion of our Prethren, is against the care of Christ, who has left no
Pastoral care on earth by this way, now since the Apostles dyed, to spread the
Gospel to those Nations who have not heard of the name of Christ; but a
Pastoral care for the Churches, is not proper to Apostles only, but only
such a Pastoral care by special direction from Christ immediately to Preach
to all. 2. Backed with the gift of tongues and of miracles; and this
essentially differenceth the Apostle from the ordinary Pastor; but the former
Pastoral care to Preach the Gospel to all Nations, and to convert, is common
both to the Apostle and Pastor.

2. Our Brethren distinguish betwixt office and the calling, and they say that
the office extends no further then the call, and by (...) he is only a
Pastor of this determinate flock. But if he be a Pastor essentially in
relation to none, but to his own Congregation from which he has all his
calling, as is supposed, by that same reason a Christian, is a Baptized
Christian to none but in relation to that particular Church in whose society he
is admitted, and he does partake of Christ's body and blood in the Lords Supper
in relation to no visible professors on earth, but only to the Parish Church
whereof he is a Member, 1 Cor. 10. 17. for they expone that only of a
Parishionall Communion within one single independent Congregation. And he must
be a Heathen, or as a Pagan in all Congregations on earth, but in his own, yea
and he is a visible professor of the Covenant of grace, which is one in
substance, (as they say) with the Church Covenant, and has claim to Christ
and all his Ordinances in no Congregation save in his own. I prove the
consequence, for by Baptism the Baptized person is incorporated in Christ's
visible Church. 1 Cor. 12. 13. If this be true when one removes from one
Congregation to another, he must be rebaptized and incorporated a visible
member of a body visible with them. And I see not how one can be in-churched to
another Congregation, and made one body therewith, while he eat of one bread
with them, as they expone, 1 Cor. 10. 17. if he be not also a member of all
visible Churches on earth.

3. If a Pastor can exercise no Pastoral acts toward any Congregation, save
toward his own, then a Pastor as a Pastor cannot pray for the whole visible
Churches of God: but the latter is absurd: Ergo, so is the former. I prove the
major, The praying for the whole visible Churches is a Pastoral Act, due to a
Pastor as a Pastor. 1. Because every visible Church is obliged as it is a
Church to pray for all the visible Churches on earth: for as a Christian is
obliged to pray for all Churches visible; so far more is a Church: now a
visible Church does not pray but by the Pastor, who is the mouth of the People
to God; and that this is a Pastoral duty due to a Pastor, I think is said
Isa. 62. 6. I have set watchmen on thy Tower, O Jerusalem, which shall never
hold their peace day nor night. Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep no
silence till he establish, and t^ll ^^ make Jerusalem the praise of the whole
earth. Also Pastors as Pastors are to pray for the King, though the King be no
member of that Congregation, whereof they be Pastors. 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. every
Pastor as a Pastor is to Preach against the sins of the Land, else how can
the People mourn for these sins? Ergo, the Pastor does exercise Pastoral
acts upon all the visible Churches on earth, upon the King, and upon the whole
Land, to which he is not a Pastor by special election.

4. If a Pastor be obliged to Preach in season and out of season, and that as
a Pastor, and because he is a Pastor. 2 Timothy 4. 2. Ergo he is to Preach as a
Pastor in any Congregation where he shall be desired.

They answer, He may Preach the word in another Congregation, not by virtue of
a calling or office, but by virtue of his gifts.

I answer, First, if he Preach by virtue of a gift only, he Preaches in that
case, not as sent of God, and so int^udeth himself, and runs unsent, and a
mere gift to be a King or a Magistrate, makes not a Magistrate, as Master
Robinson just if. of separ. page 290.
Master Robinson grants. Ergo one cannot warrantably exercise a Pastoral act
by virtue of a mere gift. 2. He may in another Congregation preach with
Pastoral authority, and use the keys by binding and loosing sins, according
as hearers do repent and harden their nockes against the Gospel. Ergo, he may
preach as a Pastor to another Congregation. 3. There shall be no Communion
betwixt Sister Churches in Pastoral acts as Pastoral, which is absurd, the
Communion shall only be of Pastoral acts as Christian acts, but in no sort
betwixt them as Pastoral acts.

5. The Scriptures for this opinion are weak, Ergo the opinion it self is
weak, I prove the antecedent. Act. 20. 28. feed the flock, over which the
holy Ghost has made you overseers. etc. there is no ground to feed even by
Preaching, or by virtue of a gift, these flocks over which the holy Ghost has
not set you: Obey them that are over you in the Lord, Heb. 13. 17. and c. there
is no warrant to submit to other Pastors that are not over you in the Lord,
though they command by virtue of a gift, not by virtue of an office or calling:
these be loose consequences.

6. All reciprocation of mutual duties amongst sister Churches, whereby they
exhort, rebuke, comfort one another, must be unlawful, for these be Church
acts, and this Author says, The office extends no further then the calling,
but there is no calling of Church Membership betwixt sister-Churches, and
therefore all these duties are not acts of the Communion of Churches, as they
are such Churches or incorporations in a Church State, but only duties of
Churches as they are Saints, but communion of Churches as Churches in the act
of Church-dispensing of the Word and Seals reciprocally one to another, is not
in the Word of God, as this opinion will infer, which is a weighty absurd.

7. The Authors of this opinion hold, That if the Congregation, for no fault,
reject the Pastor, whom they once called and elected Answer to quest 25 of old
England.
to ^e their Pastor, though in so doing they sin, and reject God in rejecting
him, yet they take nomen and esse, the name and nature of a pastor from him,
yet (say they) he still remains a Minister of Christ, till he accept a call
from another Congregation.

Hence 1. such a one is a Pastor, and yet the people have taken If the
Congregation take name and nature from any called Pastor, and that without any
all deserving in him, their censure works clave er^ante, et ex opere operato;
the Lord must make valid in heaven, an unjust censure inflicted by his Church
on Earth.
name and nature of a Pastor from him, as they gave him name and nature: Ergo,
he is either a Pastor without a calling, which is absurd, or he remains a
person in relation to another flock, who never choosed him, nor gave him any
calling. 2. To add by the way, if he be capable of a calling to another
Church, Ergo, for the time he is no Minister, else they must say, he may be a
Minister capable of two callings, to two sundry Ministeries, which yet makes
him a Pastor not in relation to one single congregation only.

It is true, they object that the Apostles, Matthew. 18. were commanded to preach
to all Nations, but Pastors are not so now, but are commanded to feed the
flock over which God has appointed them, Act. 20. 28. but it is as true the
Apostles were commanded to preach to all Nations, in opposition to the charge
that the Prophets of old were to speak to the people of Israel only, and the
Apostles Matthew. 10. forbidden to preach to the Samaritans and Gentiles; and it
is as true that Gods Spirit limited the Apostles to Preach to Macedonia, not to
Bithynia; now because this particular direction for places is wanting in the
Church, it is certain that a man is yet a Pastor in office in relation to as
many as Gods hand of providence shall send him unto, though he be chosen by a
people to feed ordinarily one determinate flock, and though he be not an
extraordinary and immediately inspired planter of Churches, or the first
planter, as were the Apostles, yet is he a Pastor in relation to all. And if
this be not said, 1. It were simply unlawful for Pastors now to plant
Churches, and spread the Gospel to those nations, who have not heard it,
because all Pastors now are ordinary, and none are immediately inspired
Apostles: but it is certain what the Apostles did, by an extraordinary gift,
as such immediately called pastors, it is unlawful for ordinary Pastors to
attempt to do, as to attempt to speak with tongues, and to plant Churches by
speaking with tongues and confirming it with miracles, is unlawful. Papists,
as Bellarmine, Suarez, Acosta, ascribe this to the Pope and his Apostles. Our
Divines answer that the Apostles that way have no successors; But what the
Apostles did by an ordinary pastoral gift, as to preach the word, administrate
the Sacraments, to erect and plant Churches by ordinary gifts, where the
Pastors can speak to the Churches by an ordinary gift in their own language,
they are obliged both within and without the Congregation, to preach as
Pastors, because where God gives gifts pastoral to pastors, he commands
them to exercise these gifts, else they dig their Lords talent in the earth:
but God gives to Pastors pastoral gifts to preach to others then their own
Congregation, and to administrate the seals to them also, and to plant
Churches. Ergo, it is presumed that the Church does give authority and an
external ministerial calling to the exercise of these gifts. 2. It is an
unwarrantable point of Divinity that the Apostles and the Pastors succeeding
to them do differ essentially in this, that Apostles might preach as Pastors
to more Congregations then one, and might plant Churches, but pastors
succeeding to them may not as Pastors preach to more Congregations then their
own, and may not plan^ Churches, for then planting of Churches now were
utterly unlawful, because it is certain there be no Apostles on earth, and it
is not lawful for a Pastor, yea nor it is lawful for any other gifted person
to do that which is essential to an Apostle and agrees to an Apostle as to
an Apostle. It is then unlawful for our brethren, seeing they be not Apostles,
to plant Churches in India.

Nor is that comparison to be regarded much; A Magistrate or an Alderman of a
City may not lawfully exercise his office of Magistracy in another City
whereof he is not a Mayor, and therefore a Pastor cannot preach, ex officio, as
a Pastor in another Congregation, whereof he is not a Pastor, nor can he
exercise discipline in another Congregation then his own, seeing another
Congregation has not by voluntary agreement, oath or paction submitted
themselves to his ministry, nor chosen him for their Pastor.

For I answer, the comparison halteth and does not prove the point, for by one
and the same act the city has chosen such a man both for to be a Magistrate,
and to be their Magistrate, and have given him thereby authority over
themselves only, so he cannot exercise the office of a Magistrate over another
City who has not chosen him to be their Mayor or ruler. But the flock does
not both call such a man, in one and the same act to be a pastor, and to be
their pastor, but he is made by the laying on of the hands of the Elders, a
Pastor, and a Pastor in relation to all to whom God in his providence shall
send him to speak, the Congregation by election does give him no authority
pastoral, but only appropriate his pastoral authority to themselves in
particular; and when they refuse him again and cast him off, they take not
pastoral authority from him, for they cannot take away that which they cannot
give; he remains a Pastor though they cast him off, as a College of
Physicians do promote a man to be a Doctor of Physic to cure diseases, a
town calls him to be their Physician, he may yet exercise acts of his
calling, and ex officio, as a Doctor, upon other cities and inhabitants of the
country; and when the city who choosed him for their physician does cast him
off, they take not from him the office of doctorship which the College of
Physicians conferred upon him, for they cannot take from him that which they
cannot give to him. Yea if any of another flock shall come and hear the word,
the Pastor offers all in one pastoral sacrifice to God in prayer, though
there be many of another Congregation in the Church hearing; yea strangers
believers communicate with him at the same Table, yet is he not their Pastor.
If a Pastor of a Congregation die or be sick, shall the children of believers,
yea shall converted Pagans being desirous to be baptized be defrauded of the
comfort of Baptism, and of the Lords Supper, for no fault in them, but only
because their Pastor is dead, may not the Congregation by their desires and
requests appropriate the office of Pastors of another Congregation in some
particular acts to their necessity? yea is not their receiving of his ministry
in that act (when their Pastor is dead) a calling warranting him to officiate,
hie and nunc? even as the desires and choice of his own flock electing him to
be their constant Pastor, gave him a calling to be their Pastor constantly, and
in all the ordinary acts of his calling? yea and it is sure as the holy Ghost
set him over his own floeke in ordinary, because they choosed him to be their
Pastor, so that same holy Ghost set him over this other Congregation, in this
act, to preach and administrate the sacraments to them, in this exigence of the
death of their Pastor; for God who rules officers and disposes of them in his
house, disposes of particular Acts of his own officers, and he is sent as a
pastor from God to speak to the stanger hic and nunc, and to work his heart
to the love of Christ, and that as a Pastor no less then to his own flock,
except we destroy communion of gifts, and of Pastoral gifts, Paul by the holy
Ghost was made the Apostle of the Gentiles, Peter of the Jews, Gal. 2. 8. yet
Peter as an Apostle preached to, and baptized the uncircumcised Gentiles, Act.
10. 11. and Paul exercised his office of an Apostle upon the Jews also, both
by preaching and baptizing, as the history of the Acts, chap. 16. chap. 17. and
other places may clear, Romans 1. so that the contrary doctrine is a new
conceit, not of God, and against the pastoral care of bringing in souls to
Christ.

Quest. II. Whether or no children be received into the visible Church by
Baptism.

In this Chapter the Author will not have persons of approved piety and
baptized to be within the visible Church, and Apology for the Churches of New
England against the exceptions of Ric: Bernard. cap. 8.
the Author of the Apology says, We do not believe that children are
received within the visible Church by baptism, for if they be not in Christ's
Church, before they be baptized, what has a Minister to do to baptize them
who are not of the Church? and if they be within the Church before baptism,
how shall they be received in the Church by baptism? if you say, they may be
received, that is, declared by baptism to have been received into the Church
by the Covenant of their fathers: We demand into which Church? not into our
own Church, for their parents were never members of a Church, and we cannot
put the seal of God upon a falsehood? not into the Church from whence their
fathers came, for we know not whether their fathers were casten out of the
Church, or not.

Some considerations are here to be set down.

1. Baptism is not that whereby we are entered into Christ's mystical and
invisible body as such, for it is presupposed we be members of Christ's body,
and our sins pardoned already, before baptism come to be a seal of sins
pardoned, but baptism is a seal of our entry in Christ's visible body, as
swearing to the Colors is that which enters a Soldier to be a member of such
an Army, whereas before his oath, he was only a heart friend to the army and
cause.

2. Baptism as it is such is a seal, and a seal as a seal adds no new
lands or goods to the man to whom the Charter and seal is given, but only does
legally confirm him in the right of such lands given to the man by the Prince
or State, yet this hinders not but baptism is a real, legal seal, legally
confirming the man in his actual and visible profession of Christ, remission
of sins, regeneration, so as though before baptism he was a member of
Christ's body, yet quoad nos, he is not a member of Christ's body visible, until
he be made such by baptism.

3. This question touches the controversy anent the efficiencie, working and
operation of the Sacraments, of which I give a taste shortly.

Sacraments are considered as Sacraments, in abstracto, in genere sign^rum; the
reprobate do receive holy Seals and Sacraments, else they could not be said
to profane the holy things of God, and so they may be Sacraments and work no
grace either by themselves or from God, all operation from, or about the
Sacrament then must be accidental to a Sacrament.

2. Sacraments are considered in concreto, according to all which they include
in their use, to wit, as they consist of the sign, the thing signified, the
institution of God, and the promise of grace, and in this meaning
Altisiodorens. lib. 4. sim. tract. 3. in Princip.
Altisiodorensis (as I conceive) makes the Sacraments not efficient causes of
grace, yet material causes containing grace, uti vas medicinam, so the
Scripture says, Baptism saves, as the Physicians glass cures the disease,
and Gul. Paris. ract. de sacram. in Genesis cap. 1. Sacramenta habent vim
impe^^a^or^a^ gratiae, ratione or ationum minist^^ et Ecclesiae.
Guliel. Parisiens. said not ill, that the Sacraments have a power to obtain
grace by faith and prayer, that is, being used in faith and sincere calling
upon God, they obtain grace; so to speak accurately this is all about the
Sacrament, rather then from the Sacrament: to which sense Du^and. 4. d. 1. art.
2. c 7.
Durandus, Occam. in 4. quaest. 1.
Occam Gab. Biel. 4 d. 1 ar. 2 c. 7.
Gabriel Biel Aliacensis in 4. q. 1. art. 1. con^l. 3.
Aliacensis do deny the Sacraments to be Physical instruments producing grace
in a Physical way, (though Papists cry out against our Divines for teaching
so) only they say, God at the presence of the Sacrament produces grace of his
mere free will, ad praesentiam Sacramenti operatur deus gratiam ex sola libera
sua voluntate. And for this cause Greg. de Valent. de offic. Sacr. c. 1. 2.
Gregorius de Valentia says these Schoolmen nihil amplius tribuere
Sacramentis, quam haeretici tribuunt, give no more to the Sacraments then
heretics give; yet Vasquez in 3. Thom. tom. 2. dis. 132. c. 4.
Vasquez, and a Jesult professor at Rome Joan de Lugo de Sacram. dis. 4 sect.
4. and sect. 5.
Joan. de Lugo teach that the Sacraments are moral causes of grace, but not
physical. It is gross that Henricus quodli. 4. q. 37.
Henricus says, that God creates grace, per tactum Sacramentorum, by the
touch of the Sacraments, as Christ cured the Leper by the touch of his hand:
for Sacraments are not miracles, as Papists say, Physic works upon a man's
body when he sleeps, so do Sacraments justify and work grace, ex opere
operat^, though the faith of the Sacrament-Receiver do work nothing at all.

4. Sacraments are considered. 1. As holy signs. 2. As Religious seals. 3. As
instruments by which faith works. 4. As means used by, us out of conscience
of obedience to Christ's commandment who has willed us to use them.

Sacraments as signs are objective and moral causes, exciting the mind as the
word does in a moral way, they represent Christ and him crucified, and this
Sacraments have commune with the word. The Sacrament is a visible word teaching
us. 2. Sacraments have the consideration of (...) and non (...) tantum, they be
seals, and not teaching and representing signs only: this way also they have
no real or physical action in them or from them; for a seal of a Prince and
State, as it is such, conferreth not an acre or rigge of land, but it is a
legal Declaration that those lands written in the body of the Charter, do
duly belong to the Person to whom the Charter is given. But Romonst. in Apol
ca. 23. in caena non obsipnatur pe^catorum re^nissi^, sed tantum ^^nsequente^
una cum Christ^ morte, cujus effectus illa obsignatio est, illam ^lim
obsignatam fuisse comme moratur ac praedicatur.
Arminians do here err, as Episcop. dis. 29. these. 8.
Episcopius, and also, Socinus de officio ^omini Christ's cap 4.
Socinus, and Smalcius disp. 9. contra ^rautzium page 199. fabulae sunt aliquam
esse internam eff^caciam in baptism.
Smalcius, who teach that the Sacraments be nothing but external rites and
declarative signs, scadowing out Christ, and the benefits of his death to us,
because they find a moral objective working in the Word of God, but a
substantial and Physical working betwixt us and Christ's body (they say) is
ridiculous, but they would remember that this is an insufficient enumeration,
the seal of a Kings Charter has besides a moral action on the mind, by
bringing to the mind such lands given to such a man, and so the seals, works
upon the witnesses, or any who reads the Charter as well as upon the owner of
the Charter: I say beside this the seal has some real action, I grant not in
it, but about it, and beside it; for it seals that such lands are really and
in effect given by the Prince and State, the action is about the seal, not in
or from the seal: When a General of an Army delivers the keys of a Castle
to a Keeper thereof, he says [I deliver the house to you] when he delivers
the Keys only Physically, and not the stones, walls or timber of the house,
by a Physical action or Physical touch, contactu Physico, yet in delivering
the keys, he does really deliver to him the Castle, but in a legal and moral
way.

Arminians and Socinians may see here that there is neither an action by way of
naked representation and teaching, for the Sacrament is a teaching sign to the
beholders who receive it not, nor is it a Physical action, as if Christ's
Physical body in a Physical way were given; yet it is an action real, and
moral: so the Sacraments are signs exhibitive and not naked signs. Our
brethren do side with Arminians and Socinians, who so often teach that
Sacraments make nothing to be what they were not, but only declare things to
be what they are. It is true, the formal effect of a Sacrament is to seal and
confirm; to seal and confirm is but a legal strengthening of a right, and
not the adding of any new thing. Yet in this the Sacrament differs from a
seal. 1. That to a civil seal there is not required the believing and faith
of the owner of the Charter, to make the seal effectual; for whether the Lord
of the lands believe that his seal does confirm him in the lands, or not, the
seal of it self by the Law of the Prince and State makes good his right to
the lands: but Sacraments do not work ex opere operato, as civil seals do
work, even as Physic works upon the body, without the faith of the mind,
though the man be sleeping. Hence the third consideration of a Sacrament as an
instrument, Faith, in and through the Sacrament being wakened and stirred up
lays hold upon Christ his death and benefits, and for this cause there is a
real exhibition of the thing signified, and the Sacrament is an exhibitive
seal.

4. The Sacrament in the use is considered as we use it in obedience to God,
who says in the Lords Supper, Do this in remembrance of me, and in this it
differs from a civil seal also. The Prince does not confer a seal to
confirm a man in his land upon condition, that he will make use of it,
otherwise it shall be to him as no seal. But God has given the scale of
grace upon condition that we make use thereof in Faith, else the Sacrament is
blanke and null. Therefore if you believe, and not otherwise, the Sacrament of
the Supper seals and confirms you in this, that Christ is given already,
and is in the present given to be nourishment to your soul to life eternal;
and so often as you eat, the certioration and assurance grows, and the faith
is increased, and a further degree of a communion with Christ confirmed; but it
is not so in civil seals, though ye repeat and reiterate the same seal of
lands, ten thousand times, it never adds one aker more to the in heritance,
because the repetition of a civil seal is not commanded under the promise of
addition of new lands, nor is it commanded, as obedience to the owner of the
Charter, that he should make use of the seal; but from the using in faith,
the Sacrament, we receive increase of Grace, and a Sacramental Grace.

Hence Baptism is a seal of our incorporation in Christ's visible Church, 1
Cor. 12. 13. For by one spirit we be all baptized into one body, whether we be
Jew or Gentile, or whether we be bound or free, Act. 2. 41. Then they that
received the word were baptized, and the same day there were added unto them
three thousand souls, so Matthew. 28. 19. the taught Disciples are to be
baptized in his name, Act. 8. 38. Philip was this way received in the Christian
Church, and Cornelius, Act. 10. 47. and Lidia, Act. 16. 15. and the Jailer,
verse. 23. 2. That which distinguishes by a visible note the Church as visible
from the invisible Church, and from other visible societies, and seals our
visible union with Christ's body, that is, the seal of our entry in the visible
Church, but baptism is such, Ergo. 3. What circumcision was to the Church of
the Jews, that baptism is to the Christian Church, because, in re
significata, in the thing signified and inward substance of the Sacrament, they
were both one, Col. 2. 11. 12. Phil. 3. 3. But circumcision was a seal of the
Jewish entry in the visible Church, Genesis 17. 13. It being the Covenant of God
in the flesh, and the uncircumcised being commanded to be cut off from Gods
people, v. 14. 4. This is according to the Scriptures and the doctrine of the
fathers, Augustine, Cyrill, Basilius, Tertullian, Hieronymus, Theophylact,
Theodoret, Ambrose, Cyprian who constantly so teach; so do our Divines Calvin

Raynoldus, Willetus, and the professors of Leyden (...).

Our Brethren say, it is the opinion of the Answer to 32 qwest. of Old England.
Anabaptists, that the Church is made by baptism, and Papists have the same
conceit, and therefore place their Font at the Church door to signify men's
entry into the Church by baptism; but we believe not that baptism does make
men members of the Church, nor to be administrated to them who are without the
Church, as the way to bring them in, but to them that are within the Church, as
a seal to confirm the Covenant of Grace to them.

Answ. 1. Anabaptists deny that any ought to be baptized while thy come to age,
and while they believe and be regenerated: and they say not far from your
selves in this, who teach it to be absurd, to put a blanke seal upon a
falsehood, and so you presuppone all to be regenerated, and truly within the
Covenant before they can be sealed to be within the Covenant by baptism; and
yet you do not think all Infants of believing parents to be regenerated and
truly within the Covenant, then is the seal blanck. Also you say, baptism is
not to be administrated to those who are without, but only to those who are
within the Church, you mean not within the Church by profession, for Infants
have no profession, and you say the Sacrament cannot be put on a blanke or a
falsehood, Ergo, you think all that are baptized ought to be within the Church
really, and not in profession ouely; Ergo they must all come to age and believe
before they can be baptized. 2. We say not that baptism makes a Church
mystical, and the true and lively body and Spouse of Christ, but that it is a
seal confirming us of our entry in the visible Church. 3. The placing of the
Font at the Church door as a mystical sign of our entry in the Church is an
Antichristian ceremony of men's devising, which we disclaim. 4. If Infants
baptized must be within the Church, before they can be baptized, how deny you
to receive them to the Lords Supper when they come to age, while they be
again, by your Church-oath, received within the Church? then are they both
within the Church, because they are baptized, and without the Church, because
they are not received in by your Church-oath again. 5. If baptism be a seal
of grace to confirm the Covenant of grace to those who are within the Church,
that is, only a single Congregation, (for you deny that there be any visible
Churches in the New Testament save these only) then are persons baptized
persons, and confirmed in the Covenant of grace only within a single
Congregation. I would know if baptism should not then be repeated and
reiterated in every ones person, as they come to a new Congregation; for they
are confirmed in the Covenant of grace, by baptism only in one single
Congregation, as you teach.

Their second and third reason is, Quest. 4. ibid.
Baptism and all ordinances are privileges given to the Church, so it makes
not the Church, but the Church is before baptism and all ordinances; the use
also of baptism is to be a seal of the Covenant, now a seal is not to make a
thing which was not, but to confirm a thing which was.

Answ. 1. The Church is indeed the Church mystical and the invisible body of
Christ before baptism, but this proves not but baptism is a seal of our
entry in the visible Church, for if this be a good argument, your
Church Covenant, which to you is an ordinance of God, falls to the grrund;
for persons are the true Churches of Christ before all the ordinances of
Christ; Ergo, by your Church Covenant men do not become Christ's visible
Church. 2. The argument has no feet, for the ordinance of preaching the Word
is a privilege of the Church and ordinance of God, yet is not the Church
before the preaching of the Word; for birth is not before the seed, but the
seed before the birth; the preaching of the Word is the seed of the Church, 1
Pet. 1. 23. and a mean of gathering the Church, Romans 10. 14. and it is also a
privilege of the Church, for he deals not so with every nation to send his
Gospel to them, Psalm. 147. 19, 20. 3. When you say that a Seal does not make
a thing that was not, but confirm a thing that was; while you would seem to
refute Papists, who vainly teach that Sacraments do confe^re grace ex opere
op^rato, by the deed done; yet do you make the Sacrament but a naked sign,
and take part with Arminians and Socinians, whose very arguments in express
words you use; for Socinus, Per baptismum non confirmatur ^ides (uti dicunt
Evangelia) cum per baptismum non quidem obsignetur, sed tantum adu^nbre^ur
peccato^um ^emissio^ ad obsignationem e^^n requi^^tur rei pr^batis and
d^cumentum aliqu^d, ^ujusm^ li nihil praestat ceremonia, and r^^us iste.
quantumvis sacer, quod ad pe^^ato^um (...) a^^tnet, sed tantum ill^m ve^^is i^n
exp sita ablutione sua adu^nbrat and quodam^^d^ del^^a^.
Socinius goes before you in this argument, and so does Smalcius dis. 9. cont.
Frantz (...). 2^9.
Smalcius follow him. (...) and sealing there is required the trying of the
thing, and some ^^^hing or document; but that ceremony (a baptisime) and that
rite, though it be ^^ly, does nothing to the remission of sins, but it does
only shadow out, and as it (...) deline^ue and point forth remission of sins
by the washing of water ^xp^ned in the Word of God. You say, Sacraments (...)
make a thing that was not, but confirm a thing that was before; you can have
no other meaning then to deny all cansalitie and all real exhibition of grace
in the Sacraments: for if a Sacrament make not a thing that was not before, or
if God give not, and really produce, confer and exhibit grace, and a
stronger measure of faith, and assurance of remission of sins, at the due and
right use of the Sacrament, the Sacrament is a naked sign, and not an
exhibitive Seal. But if Christ give and in the present exhibit as surely
remission of sins, as the infant is washen with water, as our Divines, and
the Catech^s. Palate.
Palatinate Catechize teaches, yea and Confess^an. 33, 34.
the confession thereof, and Synod Derd^a^^^. 5. sect. 17. Deus usu Sacra^^nti
poll^^^tis seu p^omiss^s ^pus gra^^ preducit ad sinem et persic^.
the Synod of Dort teaches, then by the Sacrament of Baptism, a thing is made
that which it was not. It is true a civil seal, as I said before, adds no
new lands to the owner of the Charter, but if Christ by his Seals rightly and
in faith used, do not only confirm grace and pardon, but also really
exhibit and give grace and pardon in a further degree, and a new measure of
assurance to the conscience which there was not before, you go not a streas
breadth from Arminians and Socinians, especially seeing Episcopius dis. 21.
T^es. 1, 2.
Episcopius, ^en icus Welsingius de ^ffi^. ^om. Christ page 12. Remessi^
pe^^a^^wn n^n ^^signa^^, sed significatu^.
Henricus Welsingius says that remission of finnes is not sealed by baptism,
but signified only, and Remenst. Apol. ca. 23. page 249 Tantu^ significat
professionem (...) and ejusdem cul^us quo Christo cum d^^^^, adhaerent and
solemn^ter testantur.
the Remonstrants in their Apology while they expone our Communion with Christ
in the Lords Supper, and will reject a Physical union of our souls with the
Physical substance of Christ's body, which we also reject, they say that
communion signifies only a profession of one and the same worship, whereby
Christians sol^mnly testify that they adhere to Christ as to ^^ partaker of
the Table of devils and of devils themselves, 1 Cor. 10. 18 20. is a testimony
of a communion with the Devils: but the Word of God says more, Gal. 3. 17. As
many of you as are baptized, have put on Christ, So Romans 6. 3. Therefore we are
buried with ^im by baptism unto his death, that like as Christ was raised up
from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life, Ephesians. 5. 26. That he might sanctify and cleanse his Church
with the washing of water by the word, T it. 3. 5. and 1 Pet. 3. 21. The like
figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us, etc. all this is more
then a naked signification, otherwise Manna saved Israel, and the water of the
rock did wash them from their sins, and the sacrifice of bulls and goats
did cleanse from sin, and open heaven to sinners. Therefore by baptism and
the Lords Supper something is made what it was not before, as by partaking of
the Table of Devils, the partaker is really made a partaker with the devil,
and an Idolater; and his Idolatry that he committed before was not only
confirmed and signified to be what it was before. And in this civil Seals and
Sacraments differ, as I observed before.

Argu. 4. God (say they) had a Church when there was neither baptism nor
circumcision, yea baptism has been administrated and Answ to the 4. q Arg. 3
4.
no Church Members made thereby, and men have been made members of Christ and
not then baptized; and John and Christ's Disciples baptized, Matthew. 3. 6. John
4. 1. but neither Christ nor John made new Churches, they all living and dying
members of the Jewish Church of which they were before, and if any of them
after became members of Christian Churches, they were not then baptized when
they were so admitted, having been baptized before.

Answ. We teach not that baptism constituteth the Church simply, as the
Church, but that it is a seal of a visible membership, and all baptized by
John Baptist, and the Disciples of Christ, were thereby entered in a visible
profession that they believed in Christ already come, and so were made members
and citizens by that public symbol and seal, that they were members of the
Christian Church, though as yet it received not that name of a Christian
Church, and they were members both of the Jewish and Christian Church: For
these are not contrary incorporations, and they needed not to be baptized
again when they were added to the Christian Church, for they were never added
to the visible Christian Church; nor needed they to be added, seeing they were
members of that Church before.

Argu. 5. These inconveniences (say they) should follow. 1. Baptism should be
administrate by such as are not ministers at all; for who should baptize them
who are converted without the Church? extraordinary officers are ceased and
ordinary are limited only to their own f^^ks: also the Church is before the
ministers, for the Church has power to choose ministers; now if baptism make
the Church, then must ^^n be baptized before there be ministers to baptize them.

Answ. You see to what absurdities your own grounds drive you, for if none can
baptize but these of a fixed Congregation, and if they can baptize none but
their own Congregation, none as a sent Pastor whose feet is pleasant on the
mountains, can preach and beget faith in a company of unbeleevers, not in a
Church State, which is a limiting of the wise God, who by Pastors as Pastors
can beget faith in men without a parishionall Church, which is contrary to Gods
Word, Romans 10. 14. 2. It is false that the Church ministerial, which only can
baptize, is before the officers, for they should then be before themselves,
which is absurd, nor is there such necessity of baptism, as that those who
are no ministers should baptize.

2. Inconvenient. It should follow that Papists should be members of the
Church, for they have baptism so far right, as that it cannot be repeated.

Answ. If your Church Covenant be that which essentially constituteth a
Churchmember, then Papists, Atheists, and Hypocrites may be Church Members
also by this reason, because they may swear your Church-oath. Hypocrites
doubtless do it. And this argument is as much for the Anabaptists as against
us, for it should prove that none should be baptized but members of the true
Church and sound believers: now by baptism none a^e made members of the true
Church except where baptism is received by true faith, which is more, nor can
be done by a Papist; nor is it inconvenient to say that Papists as baptized
and under that reduplication are members of the visible Church, though as
baptized thus and thus, they be not members of the true visible Church,
professing the sound faith.

Also (say they) baptism may remain where as Church Membership is dissolved,
as in the case of excommunication, Matthew. 18. 17. or of voluntary and unjust
departure, 1 Job. 2. 19. Jude 19. Heb. 10. 25. in which case such Schismatics
are no members of the visible Church, as Am^s ^as. C^^se. l. 5. c. 12. 1. 4.
Am^sius says: and if the Church be dissolved, the Church membership cease,
for, Relata se mutuo ponunt and tollunt.

Answ. This is against your selves, and does as well prove that baptism is not
a seal of the covenant of grace, for an excommunicate person may remain
externally without the covenant to the visible Church, when baptism remains
a seal, and may be a seal of a grace or privilege, which is interrupted or
removed in act, but remains in habit: as to be the eldest son of a King,
may be a seal of the sons hei^eship, and yet he may for a fault be
disherited and cast out of his place. The Church and Church Membership are
Relata secundum es^, not secundum dici only, or relata (...): but baptism and
Church Membership are not so perfect relatives, but baptism does remain and
the Church Membership may be dissolved: as the Burgess ticket whereby a man
has right to all the city privileges may remain, when the man for some
crime committed against the city has lost all his city privileges and is
not now a free citizen, in which case his Burgess ticket seals nothing to
him: so baptism seals not actual membership in case of excommunication, yet
remains baptism valid in the acts of sealing other things. As for
Schismatickes who only for Schism are out of the Church, and do hold no
erroneous point of doctrine, and are not yet convinced, they are yet members of
the visible Church, as Morton Apologia de no^is R^cl. ca. 2. ^at. 1. page 7.
Morton says from Gerson, as also Doct. Glorianus lib. de schismat. page 181.
Glorianus; but he who is casten out as a Schismaticke, is in the same case
with an excommunicate person.

Lastly, baptism is not a privilege of a particular visible Church only; nor
does the place of 1 Cor. 12. verse. 13. mean of the visible parishionall Church
of Corinth, but of the whole visible Church of Jew and Gentile, bond and free,
as the words do bear.

Quest. III. In what cases it is lawful to separate from a Church.

In this discourse three things must be discussed, 1. With what Church
retaining the doctrine of fundamentalls, we are to remain. 2. Whether our
separation from Rome be not warrantable. 3. Whether we may lawfully separate
from true Churches, for the sins of the Churches. 1 Cor. 3. 11. Another
foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid, Jesus Christ. Hence Jesus
Christ is the foundation of faith real or personal, and the knowledge of
Christ is the dogmaticall foundation of faith, Upon this foundation some build
gold, that is, good doctriae: some hay and stubble, that is, as Calvin com.
ibid.
Calvin faith, curious doctrine, Pareus com. ibid.
Pareus, vain and frivolous doctrine. We are to distinguish betwixt articles
of faith, or res fidei, matters of faith, and fundamental points of faith.
Matters of faith I reduce to three. 1. Fundamental points. 2.
Supra-fundamentalia, superstructions ^^illed upon fundamentalls. 3.
Circa-fundamentalia, things about ma^ers of Faith; for praeter fundamentalia,
things indifferent and besides the foundation in matters of Religion, and
moral carriage, I acknowledge none; fundamentalls are the vital and noble
parts or the soul of Divinity. The ignorance of fundamentalls condemns,
which is to be understood two ways. 1. The Ignorance of fundamentalls, such as
are supernatural fundamentalls, condemns all within the visible Church as a
sin; but it does not formally condemn those who are without the visible
Church, Job. 15. 22. It only makes those who are without the Church
incurable, but does not formally condemn them: as medicine not known, and so
not refused, makes sick men incurable, as a loss, but does not kill them as
a sin. 2. Superstructures, which by consequence, arise from fundamentalls,
are fundamentalls by consequent and secondarily; as the second rank of stones
that are immediately laid upon the foundation, are a foundation in respect of
the higher parts of the wall, and therefore are materially fundamental: and
the ignorance of these virtually condemn, and the denying of such, by
consequence is a denying of the foundation.

Things about the foundation, circa fundamentalia, are all things revealed in
the word of God, as all Histories, Miracles, Chronol^gie, things anent Orion,
the Pleiades, the North stars, Job 38. 31. 32. That Paul left his cloakc at
Troas. The knowledge of these is considered three ways. 1. As necessary, by
necessity of a mean, necessitate medii, and the knowledge; so is not
necessary to salvation, many are in glory (I doubt not) who lived in the
visible Church, and yet knew never that Sampson killed a Lion; but the
knowledge of all these is necessary, necessitate praecepti, because all in the
visible Church are obliged to know these things, therefore the ignorance of
these only does not actually condemn, but virtually and by demerit lead to
condemnation. 2. This knowledge is considered as commanded in the excellency
thereof, and so error and bad opinions about these are sinfully ill, though in
the regenerate, by accident, such errors condemn not, where the foundation is
holden. 3. The knowledge of these is considered as commanded and enjoined to us
with the submission of faith; for the authority of God the Speaker, and the
malicious opposing of these is a fundamental error, not formally, but by
evident consequent, for though the matter of these errors be not fundamental,
yet the malicious opposing of these is a fundamental error against this
principle [What ever God says is true;] but God says there were eight souls
in the Arc of Noah. Hence because the historiall things of Scripture and
things about the foundation, as that Paul purified himself with the Jews,
Act. 21. that Paul rebuked Peter, Gal. 2. is no less true, because God has so
spoken in his Word, then this fundamental point [Jesus Christ came into the
world to save sinners] it is clear that the specifice and essential form of
a fundamental article is not taken from the authority of God speaking in the
Word, (seeing Gods authority is one and the same in all that he speaks) but
from the influence that the knowledge of an article has to unite us to God in
Christ, and bring us to salvation. And secondly, it will follow that this [Thou
shall not by the use of things indifferent kill him for whom Christ died] and
the like be no less fundamental, by evident consequent, in respect it is
spoken by Gods own authority, then articles of our faith, Thirdly, it follows
that formalists ignorantly divide matters of Gods worship, into matters of
Faith, or points fundamental, and things indifferent, as if many Scripturall
truths were not to be found in Gods Word, such as the miracles of Moses, and
Elias, the journeyes of Paul, which are neither matters fundamental, nor yet
things indifferent. Fourthly, many things may be fundamental, by consequent,
to one who can read the Word, and hears it read, which is not by consequent
fundamental to a rude and ignorant man.

The knowledge of points fundamental is necessary. 1. To obtain salvation. 2.
To keep communion with a true Church; for we are to separate from a Church
subverting the foundation and laying another foundation. Fundamentalls are
restricted by many to the Creed of Athanasius, and Nazian. 52.
Gregorius (a) S^^^. Athanas.
Nazimzen, and Cyrill. (...). Ca^^ch. 4. sy^^b.
Cyrillus of Jerusalem, to the Apostles Creed; (as it is called) others reduce
all fundamentalls to the famous Creeds of Ni^e, of Constantinople, of Ephesus,
of Chalced^n; Estius. l. d^st. 25. s 2. ad^^tam ^^cte Instituen^^^^.
Estius restricteth fundamentalls to things necessary for the well ordering of
our life; Davenin^. de pa^e E^^l. ^ act. page 28.
Davenantius says better, That such are fundamental, the knowledge whereof is
simply necessary to salvation, i^ ignorance whereof does condemn. Doctor
Potter calls them P^ime and capital doctrines of our Religion, or of that
faith which essentially constituteth a true Church, and a true Christian; which
is good, but that he contradivideth from these things not fundamental, which
may be disputed on either side, and cannot D^ci. P^tt^, Charity mistaken, cap.
8, 9. sect. 7. page 216.
be determined by the Word of God, and must lie under a [non liquet] is his
error. Yet he may know that Bell. de Eccle. l. 3. c. 14 s. 5. Multa sum de fide
quae non sunt necessaria ad salutem
Bellarmine says right many things are of faith, (and clear in Scripture, as
historical relations) which are not fundamental. Camero. de Eccl. page 272,
273.
Camero, and a greater Divine then Camero Beza volu. opusc. 2. de notis Eccl.
page 141.
Dom. Beza reduces all fundamentalls to things which necessarily belongs to
faith and obedience: and Calvin. instit. lib. 2. cap. 16. 18.
great Calvin retrincheth fundamentalls within the Apostles Creed: Occam dial.
page 1. lib. 5. cap. 28. Semper ^^unt aliqu^ Catholici qui in vera fide (de
necessari^ ad salutem) explicit permanebunt.
Occam will have the militant (Catholic) Church always explicitly or
expressly beleevings things necessary to salvation: and our Divines teach that
the Catholic Church cannot err in fundamentalls: they mean with pertinacie
and obstinacy. 2. In all fundamentalls. 3. Totally and finally. But we are
not to believe Papists, who say things are fundamental, materially in
themselves, as all points necessary to be believed, but things are not
formally fundamental, but such things only as the Church d^fineth to be
fundamental. But 1. the foundation of our Faith is Gods Word, and Gods Word is
necessary to be believed to salvation, whether the Church define it or no: to
abstain from Idolatry is necessary to be believed, though Aaron and the Church
of Israel say the contrary, neither does Gods Word borrow authority from men.
2. If the Church may make points to be fundamental by their definition,
whereas before they were not fundamental, then may the Church make articles of
faith; Sure I am Paipsts, as Gerson, Occam, Almaine, Suarez, yea and a very
Bellarmine is against this. Yea and by that same reason they may make
fundamental points to be no fundamental points, and they may turn the
Apostles Creed into no faith at all, for ejusdem est potestos creare and
annihilare. 3. There cannot be a greater power in the Church, to define
Articles of faith, then is in God himself; but the very authority of God does
not define a matter to be an article of faith, except the necessity of the
matter so require, for God has determined in his word, that Paul left his
cloak at Treas, but that Paul left his cloak at Troas, is not (I hope) an
article of faith, or a fundamental point of salvation. 4. What can the Church
do, (says Vincentius Lyrinens advers. (...). 32. Denique quid unquam
concilioium d^cretis e^is^ est (Ecclesia) nisi ut quod an^^a simpli^^^e^ ^^e
l^^^tar, (...) idem posted diligentius ^^d^etur.
Vincentius Lyrinens.) but declare that that is to be believed, which before in
it self was to be believed: and Bellar de ^^ne auto^. l. 2. c. 12 Can^^lia
cu^ desin^unt non (...)u (...) ^sse in^allib^l^. ve^tatis, sed declarant
Bellarmine says, Counsels makes nothing to be of infallible verity, and so
does Scotus in I ^l 1^. q. t.
Scotus say, Verity before heresies (erat de fide) was a matter of faith,
though it was not declared to be so by the Church: Determinatio non facit
vertatem, says O^cam, The Churches determination makes no truth. 3. The
evidence of knowledge of fundamentals is gravely to be considered. Hence these
distinctions.

1. One may believe that Christ is the Son of God by a Divine faith, as Peter
does, Matthew. 16. 17. and yet doubt of the necessary consequences fundamental.
Ergo, Christ must be delivered into the hands of sinners, and be crucified,
as the same Peter doubted of this: for as one may fall in a grievous sin,
though regenerated, and fail in act, and yet remain in grace, in habitu, the
seed of God remaining in him; so may Peter and the Apostles doubt of a
fundamental point of Christ's rising from the dead, John 20. v 8, 9. in an act
of weakness, and yet have saving faith in Christ, as it is like many of of
the Saints at Corinth denied an article of their Faith, the rising again of
the dead: one act of unbeleefe makes not an infidel.

2. Did. A simple Papist and a Lutheran not well educated does believe upon
the same former ground, that Christ is true man, and has an habitual faith of
this article, that Jesus Christ is truly the Son of David, and yet holds
transubstantiation, or consubstantiati^, that Christ's body is in many sundry
places in heaven, and earth, on this side of the Sea, and beyond Sea, yet the
conn^xion betwixt Christ's humanity and this monster of transubstantiation not
being possible, all the error may be merely philosophic, that the extention
of quantitative parts without or beyond part, is not the essence of a
quantitative body; while as the rude man believes firmly that Christ is true
man, and so believes contradictory things by good consequence; therefore the
quality of the conscience of the believer is to be looked into, since
fundamental heresy is essentially in the mind, and pertinacy and
selfe-conviction does inseparably follow it. 1. There is a conscience simply
doubting of fundamental points, this may be with a habit of sound faith. 2. A
scrupulous conscience which from light grounds is brangled about some
fundamental points, and this is often in sound believers, who may and do
believe, but with a scruple. 3. A conscience believing opinions and
conjecturing and guessing, as in Atheists, this is damnable; but where
obstinacy is, as defending with pertinacie transubstantiation, and that it is
lawful to adore bread, this pertinacious defending of Idolatry does infer
necessarily, that the faith of the article of Christ's humanity is but false
and counterfeit, and not saving.

3. Did. There is a certitude of adherence formal, and a certitude of
adherence virtuall. A certitude of adherence formal is, when one does adhere
firmly to the faith of fundamentalls. A certitude of adherence virtuall is,
when with the formal adherence to some fundamental points, there is an
ignorance of other fundamental points, and yet withal a gracious disposition
and habit to believe other fundamentalls, when they shall be clearly revealed
out of the word, so Luke 24. Christ exponed the resurrection, and the articles
of Christ's sufferings and glorification, verse. 25, 26, 27. to the Disciples who
doubted of these before, and yet had saving faith of other fundamental points,
Matthew. 16. 17. 18.

4. Hence there be two sorts of fundamentalls, some principally and chiefly so
called, even the elements and beginning of the doctrine of Christ, as Credenda,
things to be believed in the Creed, the object of our faith; and p^tenda,
things that we ask of God, expressed in the Lords Prayer, the object of our
hope specially. 2. Agenda, things to be done, contained in the decalogue, the
object of our love to God and our brethren; Others are so secundarily
fundamental, or less fundamentalls, as deduced from these; yea there be some
artcles of the Creed principally fundamental, these all are explicitly to be
believed, noted by Vigilius Martyr. l. 2. c. 4
Vigilius Martyr, and Pareus in Prolegomen. in comment. in Hos. 4.
Pareus: as that Christ died and rose again, etc. Other Articles are but modi
articulorum fundamentalium, and expositions and evident determinations of
clear articles: As Christ's incarnation, and taking on our flesh is explained
by this, conceived of the holy Ghost, and borne of the Virgin Mary; the death
and suffering of Christ is exponed by subordinate articles, as that he suffered
under Pontius Pilate, was crucisied, etc. and these lesser fundamentalls are to
be believed, necessitate praecepti, because God commands them, but happily
non necessitate medii. It is possible many be in glory who believe not
explicitly, but only in the disposition of the mind, (as some are baptized,
in voto, in their desire only) these lesser fundamentalls, it is enough they
have the faith of non-repugnancy, or negative adherence to these, so as they
would not deny them, if they had been proponed to them in a distinct and
clear way.

5. The faith of fundamentalls is implicit three ways. 1. In respect of the
degree of believing. 2. In respect of the object. 3. In respect of the subject,
or our adherence to things believed. In respect of degrees the faith is
implicit and weak three ways, as Calvin may teach. 1. Because we are
ignorant of some less fundamentalls. 2. Because we see in a mirror and
imperfectly. 3. In respect of believing upon a false ground, as for miracles.
In respect of the object, the certainty is most sure, as sure as that God
cannot lie.

In respect of our adherence of understanding and affections; in this respect
the knowledge of fundamentalls must be certain. 1. By a negative certitude
which excludes doubting, and so Pastor and people must have a certitude of
fundamentalls, as Romans 14, 5. Col. 1. 9. Heb. 5. 12. but for a positive
certitude there is not that measure required in a teacher that is in a
scholar, for all the body cannot be an eye, 1 Cor. 12. 17. yet is a Christian
certitude and fullness of persuasion required even of all Christians, Colos. 2.
2. Colos. 3. 16. highest and greatest in its kind, though many may be saved
with less, yet a distinct knowledge of fundamentalls in all is not necessary
by a necessity of the means, necessitate medii, as Beza and Doctor Ames Peza
Vol 1. opul p 141.

Amesius de c^ust^. l. 4. c. 2. q 3.

Becanus 2. part de V^tu^i. Theolog. c. 2. q. 3.

Estius l. 3. d. 25 q. 2.

Suarez de Trip. disp. virt. Theolo. 13. sect 8.

Thomas 22. q 2. art. 5.


teach.

There is a faith of fundamentalls implicit in respect of the will and
affections which Papists make a wide faith, as the J^u^e Becanus think to
believe these two fundamentalls, 1. That there is a God. 2. That this God has
a providence con^^^ning men's salvation, though other particulars be not known.
Or implicit faith is, says Estius, when any is ready to believe what the
Church shall teach; which faith (Suarez says) though it include ignorance, yet
keeps men from the danger of errors, because it does submit the mind to the
nearest rule of teaching, to wit, to the Church; the knowledge of fundamentalls
in this sense does not save, but condemn. Thomas says better then he.

6. Did. They are not alike who believe fundamental here^ies. 2. And who
defend them. 3. And who teach them, and obtrude them upon the consciences of
others. For the first, many believe fundamental errors who are ignorant of
them, and do think that they firmly adhere to Christian Religion, O^cam
terms such, haereticos nescientes, ignorant heretics, as O^cam dialog. p.
7. l. 4. c. 3. ^^ac. ^ Moratius de fide did. 24. sect. 4 n. 7. 8.
the Marcionites, and the Manicheans, and these the Church should tolerate
while they be instructed. It is true the Jesuit Meratius says, When many
things are proposed to the understanding for one and the same formal reason,
to wit, for divine authority, the understanding cannot embrace one but it must
embrace all, nor ^^ject one, but it must reject all, which is true of a formal
malicious rejecting; the Manichean believes nothing because God says it, and
has faith sound and saving in nothing, but it is not true of an actual or
virtuall contempt, in one or two fundamentalls, because believers out of
weakness, ignorance, and through strength of tentation may doubt of one
fundamental, as the Disciples doubted of the resurrection, Joh. 20. 9. and yet
in habit believe all other fundamentalls, but the Church is to correct such as
profess fundamental heresies, and to cast out of the Church seducers and
deceivers.

7. Did. It is one thing to hate a fundamental point, as that [Christ is
consubstantiall with the Father] as the Arians do, and another thing, by
consequence to subvert a fundamental point, as Papists by consequence deny
Christ to be true man, while they hold the wonder of Transubstantiation, yet
do not they hate this conclusion formally [that Christ is true man.]

8. Did. Though it were true which Doctor Christo. Potter says, If we put by
the Points wherein Christians differ one from another, Doctor Potter Charity
mistaken, c. 8. s. 7. page 235.
and gather into one body the rest of the articles, wherein they all gnerallaly
agree, we should find in these propositions, which without all controversy
are universally received in the whole Christian world, so much truth is
contained, as being joined with holy obedience may be sufficient io bring a man
to everlasting salvation. I say, though this were true, yet will it not follow
that these few fundamentalls received by all Christians, Papists, Lutherans,
Arians, Verstians, Sabellians, Maccdonians, Nestorians, Eutychanes, Socinians,
Anabaptists, Treithitae, Antitrinitarii (for all these be Christians and
validely baptized) do essentially constitute a true Church, and a true
Religion. Because all Christians agree that the old and New Testament is the
truth and Word of God, and the whole faith of Christian Religion is to be
found in the Old Testament, acknowledged both by Jews and Christians; for that
is not the Word of God indeed in the Old Testament, which the Jews say is the
Word of God in the Old Testament. Yea the old and new Testament, and these few
unc^n^^averted points received universally by all Christians are not Gods Word,
as all these Christians expone them, but the dreams and fancies of the Jews
saying, that the old Testament teaches that Christ the Messiah is not yet come
in the flesh, the Treithitae say there be three Gods, yet are the Treithitae
Christians in the sense of Doctor Potter: so that one principal as that There
is one God, and Christ is God and man, and God is noely to be adored, not one
of these are uncontraverted, in respect every society of Sectaries have
contrary expositions upon these common fundamentalls, and so contrary
Religions. Who doubts but all Christians will subscribe and swear with us
Protestants the Apostolic Creed but will it follow that all Christians are of
one true Religion, and do believe the same fundamentalls? now these
fundamentalls are the object of faith according as they signify things. To us
and to the Treithitae this first Article (I believe in God) as I conceive does
not signify one and the same thing; now join this (I believe in God) with
holy obedience as we expone it, and as the Treithitae expone it, it could
never be a step to everlasting salvation; for it should have this meaning, (I
believe there is one only true God, and that there be also three Gods) and what
kind of obedience joined with a faith made up of contradictions, can be
availeable to salvation? 3. One general Catechize and confession of faith made
up of the commonly received and agreed upon fundamentalls, would not make us
nearer peace, though all Christians should swear and subscribe this common
Christian Catechize, no more then if they should swear and subscribe the old
and new Testament, as all Christians will do, and this day does.

9. Disl. Though the knowledge of fundamentalls be necessary to salvation, yet
it cannot easily be defined, what measure of knowledge of fundamentalls, and
what determinate number of fundamentalls does constitute a true visible Church,
and Voetiu. de^p. cans. Papa^s^.
a sound believer, as the learned Voetius says.

Hence 1. They are saved, who soundly believe all fundamentalls materially,
though they cannot distinctly know them, under the reduplication of
fundamentalls, nor define what are fundamentalls, what not.

2. Though a Church retain the fundamentalls, yet if we beforced to avow and
believe as truth, doctrines everting the foundation of faith, against the
article of one God; if we must worship as many Gods as there be hosties, if
Christ's Kingly, Priestly, and Prophetical office be overturned, as we were
forced in Popery to do, we are to separate from the Church in that case.

It is not true that Master Robinson says, This distinction of fundamentalls
and non-fundamentals in injurious to growing in Robinson lust ^s^. page 362.
grace, whereas we should be led on to perfection, as if it were sufficient for
a house, that the foundation were laid.

Answ. It follows not, for the knowledge of fundamentalls is only, that we
may know what is a necessary mean of salvation, without which none can be
saved, notwithstanding, he who grows not, and is not led on to perfection,
never laid hold on the foundation Christ; nor are we hence taught to seek no
more, but so much knowledge of fundamentals, as may bring as to heaven, that is
an abuse of this Doctrine. 2. Robinson faith fundamental truths are holden
and professed by as vile heretics as ever were since Christ's days, a company
of excommunicates may hold, teach and defend fundamental truths, yet are they
not a true Church of God?

Answ. Papists hold fundamentalls, and so do Jews hold all the old Testament
and Papists hold both new and old, but we know they so hold fundamentalls, that
by their doctrine they overturne them; and though there be fundamentalls
taught in the Popish Church, which may save if they were believed, yet they are
not a true and ministerial Church simply, because, though they teach, that
there is one God, they teach also there is a thousand Gods whom they adore, and
though they teach, there is one Mediator, yet do they substitute infinite
Mediators with and besides Christ, so that the truth is, not a formal,
ministerial and visible active external calling is in the Church of Rome, as
it is a visible Church, in the which we can safely remain, though
fundamentalls be safe in Rome, and the books of the old and new Testament be
there, yet are they not there ministerially as in a mother whose breasts we can
suck; for fundamental points falsely exponed, cease to be fundamental
points, yea as they be ministerially in Rome, they be destructive of the
foundation, though there be some ministerial acts valid in that Church, for
the which the Church of Rome is called a true Church, (...), in some respect,
according to something essential to the true Church, yet never sine adjecto,
as if it were a true Church, where we can worship God. Fundamentalls are safe
in Rome materially in themselves, so as some may be saved who believe these
fundamentalls; but fundamentalls are not safe in Rome, Ecclesiastice,
Ministeraliter, Pastoraliter, in a Church way, so as by believing these from
their chaires so exponed, they can be saved who do believe them. 2. Out of
which we may have the doctrine of faith and salvation as from a visible mother,
whose daughters we are. Some say the fundamentalls amongst Lutherans are
exponed in such a way as the foundation is everted? I answer, There is a
twofold eversion of the foundation. 1. One Theological, Moral and
Ecclesiastic, as the doctrine of the Council of Trent, which is in a
ministerial way, with professed obstinacy against the fundamental truths
rightly exponed, and such an eversion of the foundation makes the Popish
Church no Church truly visible, whose breasts we can suck. But for
Lutheranes, their subversion of the foundation by philosophic consequences
without professed hatred to the fundamentalls, and that not in an
Ecclesiasticke and Ministerial way, does not so evert the fundamentalls, as
that they be no visible Church. The learned Pareus shows that there be no
difference Pareus in Jere. c. 12, 13, 14, etc.
betwixt us and Lutherans in heads absolutely necessary to salvation, the
dissension is in one point only anent the Lords Supper, not in the whole
doctrine thereof, but in a part thereof, not necessary for salvation. There
were divisions between Paul and Ba^nabas, betwixt Cyprim an African Bishop,
and Stephanus Bishop of Rome, anent baptism of heretics, which Cyprian
rejected as no baptism; betwixt Basilius Magnus and Eusebius Ce^ariensis,
because Basilius stood for the Emperor Va^ns his power in Church matters; so
was there dissension betwixt Augustine and Hier^nimus anent the ceremonies of
the Jews, which Hyeronymus thought might be retained to gain the Jews; so
there was also betwixt Epiphanius and Chrysostom anent the books of Orig^n.
The Orthodox believers agreed with the Novations against the Arrians anent the
(...); the consubstantialitie of Christ; and though excommunicate persons
defend and hold all fundamentalls sound, and so may be materially a true
Church, yet because their profession is no profession, but adenying of the
power of godliness, they cannot be formally a visible Church, but are for
scandalls casten out of the visible Church.

But (says Robinson) most of England are ignorant of the first rudiments and
foundation of Religion, and therefore cannot be a Robinson Justifi. page 362.
Church.

Answ. Such are materially not the visible Church and have not a profession,
and are to be taught, and if they wilfully remain in that darkness are to be
cast out.

But (says he) the bare profession of fundamentalls makes not a Page 363, 364.
Church; they must be a company of faithful people, and if they must not be
truly faithful, then they must be falsely faithful; for God requires true
and ready obedience in his word, according to which we must define Churches,
and not according to casual things.

Answ. This is a special ground that deceives the Separatists, their
ignorance (I mean) of the visible Church, for the visible Church consists
essentially neither of such as be truly faithful, nor of such as must be
falsely faithful; for the ignorant man sees not that the visible Church
includes neither faith, nor unbelief in its essence or definition. It is
true, to the end that professors may be members of the invisible Church, they
must be believers, and must believe, except they would be condemned eternally;
but to make them members of the visible Church neither believing nor
unbeleeving is essential, but only a profession ecclesiastically in tear,
that is not scandalous and visibly and apparently lewd and flagitious, such as
was the profession of Simon Magus, when he was baptized with the rest of the
visible Church, Act. 8. And God indeed requires of us true worship and ready
obedience, as he says, but not that a visible Church should be defined by true
and sincere obedience: for essentials only are taken in a definition, and
casual corruptions are only accidental to Churches, and fall out through men's
faults, and therefore should not be in the definition either of a visible or an
invisible Church; nor should ready and sincere obedience which is a thing
invisible to men's eyes, be put in the definition of a visible Church, for it is
accidental to a visible Church, and nothing invisible can be essential to
that which essentially is visible; the visible Church is essentially visible.
Anent separation from Rome we hold these Propositions.

1. Profession consistetly not only in a public ministerial avowing of the
truth, but also in writing, suffering for the truth, and death-bed-confessions
of the truth; These worthy men in their own bowels, as Occam, Petrarcha,
Gerson, Mirandula, these who in their death bed renewed confidence in merits,
Saints, Images, were the true Church, and the other side the false Church, all
the Churches of Asia excommunicated by Victor, as Bellarmine de ve^ bo Dei lib.
3. cap 6.
Bellarmine says and Binnius; Binnius tom. 1. conc^l. fell. 133.
Pope Stephen then and his Council denying communion to Cyprian and fourscore
of Bishops must be the Separatists, and Cyprians and his adherents the true
Church. 2. In this division we are united to the true Apostolic, to the
ancient Church, to the true ancient Church of Rome, which opposed the Apostate
Church of Rome, but an immediate and personal adherence to, and union with the
ancient Church is not essential to a visible Church.

God Orthodox is preached, and the Sacraments duly administered, we think
unlawful; and the place for separation mainely I would have vindicated, 2 Cor.
6. 14. Be ye not unequally yoaked together with unbeleevers, etc. Robinson will
have this strong for their separation, and says. 1. It is true, he finds
fault with the believing Corinthians, communicating with the unbeleeters in the
Idol feasts, but with all it must be considered, that the Apostle up in this
particular occasion delive^eth a general doctrine, as from ^^^^^tion, 1 Cor.
5. to forbid commingling with fornicators, with (...) persons, with Idolaters,
etc. and as he forbids partaking with the wicked in their evils, yet then
therein did he forbid all religious communion with them, since their very
prayers, and other Sacrifices are their evils, wherein whilst the godly does
communicate with them, what do they else but acknowledge their common right
and interest in the holy things with them?

Answ. 1. It is good that Robinson with the interpreters does acknowledge, that
Paul forbids communicating with unbeleevers a^ Idol feasts, as the place
will command us to separate from the Mass Service, and therein let it be that
he infers a general; Ergo, you are to separate from all the worship of the
Gentiles Idols, and are not to be mixed with them in their service, which they
give to their false gods: but this is not the general which includes
separation from a Church, in the service of a true God, the service being
lawful, and only evil to some worshippers and by accident, because they eat
to themselves damnation, but not damnation to others.

2. But he forbids (says he) all partaking with the wicked in their evils.
I distinguish their evils in their evils, of their personal sins in not
worshipping the true God in faith, sincerity and holy zeal, that I deny, and
it is to be proved, Christ himself and the Apostles eated the Passover, and
worshipped God with one whom Christ had said had a devil, and should betray
the Son of man, and was an unclean man, Job. 13. 11, 12. 18. He forbids
all partaking with the wicked in their evils, that is, in the unlawful and
Idol-worship, or in their superstitions and will worship; that is true, but
nothing against us, or for your separation. If it be said, Judas was neither
convicted of his Traitory to Christ, nor was he known to the Apostles by name
to be the man, for some of them suspected themselves, and not Judas to be
Traitor: but you communicate with such as be professed and avowed Traitors, and
persons known to be scandalous, and so you acknowledge you have a common right
in these holy things, with these persons.

Answ. 1. Christ showed to the Disciples that they were an unclean society,
and that one had a devil, and therefore though they knew not the man by name
who had the devil, they knew the society to have a devil, and to be
unclean, for that one man his cause, and so neither Christ nor his Disciples
should have taken part with the evils, and the Prayers and sacrifices of the
wicked, for in so doing they acknowledge that they have commune right and
interest in the holy things of God, with some who have a devil, and with an
unclean society; but you cannot condemn Christ and the Disciples
communicating at that Supper.

2. Though the scandalous person be not convicted of the scandal, that does
make the scandal more grievous and heinous to the scandalous person, in that
he dare remain in a sin, though he be convicted of his guiltiness by the
Church, but it does not make the persons scandal to be no scandal, and no
uncleanness at all; for magis and minus non variant speciem, more or less of
sin does not vary the nature of sin: now if Paul will the Corinthians to meet
together to eat the Lords body, as he does, 1 Cor. 11. and know that there
be amongst them carnal men, such as go to Law with their brethren before
Infidels, such as deny the resurrection, such as come drunk to the Lords
Supper, though they be not convicted of these sins by the Church, yet if
they be known to others, as Paul does declare them in that Epistle, they must
pollute the Lords Table before the Church convict them, no less then after the
Church has convicted them, though the pollution may be more and greater after
Church-conviction, then before, yet Paul wills all the Corimbians to
acknowledge their communion with the sins of the non-convicted, and with
their abominable and wicked sacrifices and prayers, which none can teach or
believe of the Apostle led by an infallible spirit, and therefore to
communicate with them, is not to take part of their evils.

3. He says at last, They who communicate at the same Table with scandalous
persons, what do they else but acknowledge their commune right and interest in
the holy things of God, with such scandalous persons? And this is that which
Master Coa^hman says, This banquet Robert Coachman, The cry of the S^o^e,
sect. 4. page 10. 1^.
of the Lords Supper, is the nearest fellowship that the Saints have in this
world; what lying signs and dec^avable demoust^ations d^e these make who
communicate they care not where, nor with whom, but think if they examine
themselves, it is well enough, forgetting that it is an act of communion? for
if we sever the word Sacrament from communion, we put out Gods term and put
in our own.

But I answer. 1. These who are baptized by one spirit unto one body, as all
the visible Churches are, 1 Cor. 12. 13. and professedly hear one Word
preached, do thereby acknowledge they have one communion, right and interest
in these holy things, to wit, in a communion with Christ in remission of
sins, and regeneration sealed in baptism, and in one common Savior, and
common faith preached in the Gospel; and is this communion unlawful, and this
fellowship a lying sign, because all baptized, and all hearing one Gospel,
and that in an avowed profession, are not known to be regenerated? Then should
no Infants be baptized, except they know all in the visible Congregation
baptized with them to be regenerated also, for it is certain that we have a
communion most inteare and visible with all who are baptized.

2. It is no inconvenient to profess that we are all one visible body in the
Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 10. 17. though we be not one invisible, true, and
mystical, and redeemed body of Christ, as it is said, 1 Cor. 10. 2. That all
were baptized unto Moses in the cloud, and in the Sent, v. 3. and that all did
eat the same spiritual meat, v. 4. and that all did drink the same
spiritual drink, the rock Christ, yet did they not sin in this, and
partake with the wicked in their ^ills, to wit in their wicked prayers and
sacrifices, because it is said, v. 3. God was not pleased with many of them in
the Wilderness, because, v. 6. They lusted after evil things, and many of
them were Idolaters, Epicures, fornicators, tempters of Christ, and mumurers,
and there sell of them in one day twenty three thousand, v. 7. 89, 10, 11. And
upon the same ground Paul says in the same place, v. 16, 17. that we many
(speaking of the Corinthians) are all (...) ^read, and one body, and yet v. 21.
many of these were parta^ers of the Table and cup of the devils: and in the
next Chapter, many came drunk to the Lords Table, many did eat and drink
their own damnation, and were stricken therefore of God with sickness and
death, v. 18, 19, 20. 29, 30, etc. and yet v. 33. Paul charg^th them to come
together to the Lords Supper, so far is he from a shadow of separation. The
Sacrament is a seal of their unity of one body, and is a Seal of their
communion with Christ, v. 16. but all who receive the sign, have not a
communion with Christ, nor are they all sealed, as one body mystical of
Christ, only they are in profession by eating one bread, declared to be one
body, and do become one body visible, and no question many make the Sacrament
to themselves a lying sign, and a blaneke ordinance. But first, this is not
the sin of such as do communicate with those, who receive the blaneke seal,
and make the Sacrament to themselves a lying seal and damnation; for they are
commanded to exaamine themselves, and so to eat, but they are not commanded to
examine their fellow-communicants, and they are to judge themselves, but not to
judge their fellow-communicants.

Master Coachman. How can any godly man consent, or say Amen Master Coachmans
cry of the stone. Sect. 4 page 11.
(says be) to such an holy action, when it is jointly done, by such, as for
the most part, are the enemies of God?

Answer 1. This makes against the man, and the Churches of New England, for
they admit constantly to the hearing of the word, and so to the prayers of the
Church, those who are not received members of the visible Church: how can any
godly man say Amen to the action of hearing the word, when it is jointly done
by Gods enemies? I prove the Antecedent, the unity of faith hearing one word of
faith preached, Ephesians. 4. 5. makes a visible body in profession, even as the
joint partaking of one bread, and one cup in the Lords Supper, makes one body,
by obsignation or sealing, 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.

2. Division of hearts in hearing, while some follow Paul, some Apollo, some
Cephas, makes a schism and division in Christ's body, 1 Cor. 13. Ergo, in
hearing one and the same word preached, there is a visible Church-union, for
all division of that kind presupposes a union, and unity in a visible
incorporation.

3. 1 Cor. 14. 26. When ye come together (as one Church body) every one of you
has a Psalm, has a Doctrine, verse. 4. He that prophecieth edifiesh the
Church, verse. 31. so ye may all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and
all may be comforted, 35, it is shame for a woman to speak in the Church.
Therefore the Saints meet together in one Church to be edified, and comforted
by doctrine and hearing of the word, do all jointly perform an action of
hearing and learning of the word of God, and are in that one Church, and one
visible body, and called one Church, verse 4. 5. that the Church may receive
edifying, verse 12. Seek that ye may excel (by prophesying) to the edifying
of the Church, verse. 23. If therefore the whole Church come together, unto some
place, etc. verse. 28. if there be not an interpreter, let him keep silence in
the Church, verse 34, 35. And these who understand, are all to say, Amen, to
that which is prophesied, verse 16, 17. And yet that action of hearing and
saying Amen to the word preached, and to the prayers of the Church, is done by
many unregenerated, who are yet in the state of enmity with God, as our
Brethren grant, in that they do admit all to be a Church, and one Church
hearing the word preached.

2. But how can they say Amen, (says he) to a holy action done (...) Gods
enemies?

I answer, 1. This objection is no less against Paul and the word of God, then
against us; for many enemies to God, whose hearts are rockie, thorny and stony
ground, do hear the (...) of God, and that by Gods commandment, Matthew. 13.
verse. 2. 3, 4, 5. and c. The deaf and the blind are commanded to hear, Esai.
42. 18. Esai. 28. 9, 10. and these whom God has covered with a spirit of
slumber, are to hear the words of the sealed book, Isai. 29. 9. 10, 11. even
those who stumble at the word, and fall, and are broken, Esai. 8. 14. 15, 16. 1
Pet. 2. v. 8. What godly man can say, Amen, to such a holy action, as is
performed by Gods enemies?

2. The godly say Amen to actions of Gods worship two ways, 1. As it is the
ordinance of God enjoined, and commanded, to the wicked and hypocrites, no
less then to the godly, and we are to countenance their communicating, as we
do their hearing of the word, and to join with them both, in our real and
personal presence, and say Amen with them, as the Disciples gave their
personal Amen, and their countenance and presence to a holy action at the last
Supper, with one of their number, whom they knew to have a Devil, and to be a
traitor, and dipped their hand in the dish with this man, after Christ had
warned them, that there was such an one: but this is but to say Amen to the
external worship, which is lawful, according to the substance of the act.

2. The godly may be throught to say Amen to the actions of worship performed
by the enemies of God, by approving, allowing, and commending the manner of
their performing the holy actions of Gods worship, that is, they may be thought
to approve the manner of their hearing and receiving the Sacraments, that is,
when they approve their performing of those holy actions without faith, and
with wicked hearts and hands, and when they allow that they eats their own
damnation, thus no godly man can say Amen to holy actions performed by Gods
enemies, nor is our external communicating with them, a saying Amen to the
wicked manner of receiving the seals, this is most unreasonable, and cannot be
proved by Gods word.

But Robinson will prove that in this place, 2 Cor. 6. the Lord forbids
communion not only with evil works of wicked Just if page 265.
men, but with their persons, and that he commands a separation, not only
real, but personal.

1. Because (says he) the Scripture has reference to the yoaking of the
unbeleevers in marriage, as the occasion of spiritual idolatrous mixture,
which he reproves; now this joining was not in an evil, or unlawful thing,
but with the wicked and unlawful persons.

Answer, If the man had formed a syllogism it should be a crooked proportion,
if Paul allude to the marriage with insides, then as we are not to join with
Pagans in lawful marriage, so neither with scand ^^ous Christians in lawful
worship. This connection is gratis said, and we deny it; But as we are not to
marry with Pagans, so not to sit in their Idoll-Temple, and to be present in
their Idoll-worship, else we were not to admit them, or their personal
presence to the hearing of the word, contrary to your selves and to 1 Cor. 14.
24, 25. So if because we are not to marry with them, we are not to be
personally present with them, at the receiving of the Sacrament, neither at the
hearing of the word, nor are we to be baptized, because Sim^n Magus, and many
Hypocrites are baptized. 3. Local separation from Idoll-worship, in the
Idoll-Temple, we teach as well as Robinson, but what then? he commands local
and personal separation from all the professors of the truth, in the lawful
worship of God, this we deny to follow.

2. The very terms says Robinson) believers, unbeleevers, light, darkness,
Christ, Belial, do import opposition not of things only, but of persons also,
for things sake, so the faithful are called Cor. 5. ^1
righteousness, Matt. 5. 14
light, and the ungody Sphes. 58.
darkness, and so not only their works, but their persons are called.

Answer. 1. We deny not opposition of persons, and separation local from
persons in Idoll-worship, at an Idoll-Table, but hence is not concluded
personal separation from wicked men in the lawful worship of God. 2. This is
for us, we are to separate from the persons; because the worship is unlawful,
and Idoll-worship, and therefore the contrary rather follows, i^ the worship
were lawful, we would not separate, for remove the cause and the effect shall
cease.

3. The Apostle (says he) forbids all unlawful communion in the place, but
there is an unlawful communion of the faithful with the wicked in things
lawful, as with the excommunicated, idolatrous, (...), or my other flagitious
person in the Sacraments, prayers, and other religious exercises, and the Jews
were to separate themselves, (...) from the manners of the He^then, but even
from their ^ers^s, ^zr. 19. 1. 2. and 10. 2, 3. Nehem. 9. 10. 28 30. And Paul
(...) the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 5. for having fellowship, not only in ^^ persons
in^est, but with the incestuous person, whom therefore they (...) ^urge out,
and to put away from amongst themselves, verse 5. ^. 13.

Answer, It is true, there is an unlawful communion of the faithful that is
overseers and guides of the Church, to whom God has committed the keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven, with excommunicated persons, in that they retain one
worthy to be excommunicated in the bosom of the Church: but communion with the
Church in the holy things of God, is not hence concluded to be unlawful,
because the guides of the people communicate with that Church where the
excommunicated person is suffered, it is the sin of the Church-guides, that
an excommunicated person is not cast out, and that he is suffered to
communicate at the Lords Table, and to profane ^, in not discerning the Lords
body, but it is not the sin of either guides or the people, to communicate at
one Table with the excommunicated person, or him that deserves to be
excommunicated; for not casting out is one thing, and to communicate with the
excommunicated in the true visible Church is another thing; the former is a
sin, not to use the power that Christ has given, but to communicate with the
excommunicated person, is not a sin, but a remembering of the Lords death at
Christ's commandment; for one sin makes not another sin to be lawful, or
to be no sin; to deliver one unto Satan is to debar one from the Lords
Supper, and to repute him as a Publican, and to judge him not worthy of the
communion in the holy things of God, with the Church; but this is not to repute
the Church or guides or members as Publicans and Heathens, and as not worthy of
Church Communion with the man who is cast out: we see the Church of Corinth
rebuked, for not excommunicating the incestuous man, but not forbidden to come
and eat the Lords Supper with him, and these who came and did eat their own
condemnation^ 1 Cor. 11. yea they are commanded to come to the public meeting:
Ergo, it is one thing not to excommunicate the scandalous, a sin, and another
thing to communicate with the scandalous, which is not a sin directly, nor
forbidden at all. Though Paul have an allusion to the Lords separating of the
Jews from all other people, yet it follows not that we are to separate from
the wicked men and unrenewed, professing the truth that way; first, because
there was a typical separation in marriage with Canaanites; if the Jews
should marry with the Canaanites, the marriage was null, and the Moabites and
Ammonites ought not to enter in the Temple.

2. The Jews are to separate from the manners of Heathen, and from the persons
of strange wives, yea and to put their wives of the Canaanites after they had
married them, away from them, in token of their repentanee, because the
marriage was not only unlawful, but null, as is clear, Ezra. 9. 1, 2, 3.
N^hem. 9. 1, 2. And this was a peculiar Law binding the holy seed, but does not
infer the like separation of Christians, for 1 Cor. 7. 11, 12. it is not
lawful for a Christian to put away a Pagan wife, or for the believing wife to
forsake the Pagan husband, and therefore that Jewish separation cannot infer
a separation from the persons and worship of unbeleevers; and it is true that
Paul commands, to cast out the incestuous person, and to separate him from
the Church, but it follows not, therefore the Church was to separate from the
public worship because he was not cast out.

4. Says Robinson, the Apostle inj^yneth such a separation, at upon which a
people is to be esteemed Gods people, the Temple of the living God, and may
challenge his promise to be their God, and to dwell amongst them, and to walk
there; and as for the Temple, the stone^ and timber thereof, were separated
from all the trees of the Forest, and set together in comely order; and he has
reference to the separating of the Jews from all other people, as appears,
Levit. 23, 24, 26. 11, 12. And this must be the condition of the Israel of God,
to the worlds end.

Answ. There is a separation from Idol-worship here, such as is proper to the
people in Covenant with God, de jure, the visible Church should separate from
Idols and the profane world in their Idol-worship, and sinful conversation.
Ergo they should separate from the worship of God; What sewing is here? this is
nothing for separation from the true Church, or true worship, for the sins of
worshippers. Hear what interpreters say, as Gual^her com. in loc.

Divines accord in this, that separation from Idolatry and the Idoll-tables of
the Gentiles is here commanded, and that because the Church of God in the New
Testament, is no less a people in covenant with God, to whom the promises do
belong, and the presence of God working in them, then the people of the Jews
were of old: But it follows not hence that one part of the Israel of God
under the New Testament should separate from the other. What weakness is this?
he alludeth to Isreal's separation from the Nations, which was personal;
therefore we are in person to separate from the true Church for their personal
sins, when the worship is right.

But Robinson (...). page 266, 267.
Robinson says, Papists, Atheists, Idolaters, Anabaptists, and many more, do
worship Jesus, from whose societies notwithstanding you profess separation. 2.
The Ismaelites and Edomites do worship the true God, though not after a true
manner, and yet the Israelites were a people separated from them, an Edomite
might not bear any public office among the Jews to the third generation: yea
Israel was commanded to separate from Israel, for a usurpation of the
ministry, Number. 16. and upon Jeroboam his defection in the ministry, worship
and new devised holy days, 2 Chronicles. 11. 13, 14, 15. 1 King. 12. 28, 29, 30,
31, 32.

Answ. 1. Papists, Anabaptists, Idolaters, are disavowed by us, and from them
we separate, because though they profess the true God as Edom did, yet they
closely do evert the fundamentals; neither we, nor the reformed Churches, in
words or by consequence do evert the fundamentals, and necessary points of
salvation, and if the Church of Corinth was not to be separated from, nor
Thyatira, where the resurrection was denied, and false doctrine maintained, you
have no reason to parallel us with Papists, Atheists, Anabaptists.

2. No Covenant is made with the one true God, and the Edomites and Ismaelites,
but the promises are made to us, and to our children, and to as many as the
Lord shall call, by the true Gospel preached, Act. 2. 39.

Robinson. The Apostles (says he) disjoyneth righteousness and
unrighteousness, light and darkness, as far asunder, as believers ^ag. 271.
and unbeleevers, as the Temple of God and Idols, in which former also the
union betwixt Christ and Belial, is as monstreus as in the latter: also all
unbeleevers are led by the devil, and cannot be the marter of the true Church,
and that some persons led by the devil and some not should be the marter of
the true Church is unknown to Scripture.

Answ. 1. In the Text, 2 Cor. 6. Righteousness and unrighteousness, light and
darkness are as far asunder as the temple of God and Idols, and as Israel
and Edom. I answer in respect of the object material of false worship, they
cannot morally be united, that is true, believers at Corinth worshipping the
true God in Christ, cannot be united with such, as in Idols temples are at one
and the same Idol worship: and as to marry Christ and Belial, light and
darkness, is a monster, so it is no less morally monstrous, that the true
worshippers of God in Corinth, who give themselves out for the servants of God,
should be joined in any Society with the service of dumb Idols; and thus
far Israel and Edom, a servant of God and an Idolater, must separate and part
companies, but in respect of the persons they may be united in one visible
corporation and Church; else you may say by this argument, because faith in the
eleven Apostles and unbeleefe in Judas, are as contrary as light and
darkness, Christ and Belial, and as Isreal's true worship and Edoms false
worship, and because the righteousness, light and faith of the Apostolic
Church. Act. 8. and the unrighteousness, darkness and unbeleefe of Simon
Magus are contrary to others (as they are as contrary as light and darkness)
that therefore the eleven Disciples and Judas made not one visible Church and
the Apostolic Church, and Simon Magus and others in the gall of bitterness
with him, though baptized and joined to the Church, did not make up one visible
Church; now since you acknowledge no visible Church, but there be in it beside
unbeleevers, though not seen, there is no visible Church of your own, wherein
this monstrous combination of light and darkness is not. And so all your
Churches are false in their constitution, if there may not be a union of the
persons of men led by God, and regenerated, and of Hypocrites led by Satan, and
unregenerated; and these meeting to one and the same true worship, as Judas and
the eleven did eat one and the same passover.

The Scripture (says Robinson) denounces the same judgment Page 272.
of God, Ezech. 18. upon him that defiles his neighbors wife as to him who
lifts his eyes to the mountains and the Idols thereof, and murderers are
excluded out of the heavenly Jerusalem as well as Idolaters, and Matthew. 28. We
are to esteem every obstinate offender as a heathen and a Publican, and Paul
charge the Corinthians to avoid F^rnicators, etc. 1 Cor. 5. as well as
Idolaters, so all carnal men are Idolaters, making their belly their God: and
the Apostle to Titus calls profane persons unbeleevers or infidels; Ergo,
we should walk toward the one, as toward the other, that is, separate from
them both.

Answ. 1. It is true, God denounces judgment against lewd and unknown
hypocrites, as against worshippers of the Gods of the Zidonians, as your places
prove, Ezekiel. 18. Rev. 22. but your Logic is poor and blind, that you will
separate from the true Church, in which there be secret hypocrites, and so
from your own Churches, as you would separate from the Church of the
Zidonians, who worship professedly Baa^, and deny Jehovah to be God, you make
arguments without head or foot.

2. Murderers are excluded out of heaven, and haters of their brethren, who
are murderers from life eternal, 1 John 3. 15. as Idolaters, what then? Ergo,
ye will exclude them out of the visible Church, and separate from them. It is
good that you come out with Anabaptists to make these only of your visible
Church, who shall reign in glory with Christ, and these only, and all without
your visible Church to be firebrands of Hell, as Revel. 22. 15.

3. We are 1 Cor. 5. to avoid Fornicators, no less then Idolaters, true. Ergo,
we are to separate from the Church, where there be Fornicators, seeing they
make the Church to be false in its constitution, as we are to separate from a
society of heathen Idolaters who worship a false God: do you love such
consequences? men not forsaken of mother wit would say, I must separate from
Aaron, and the whole Church of Israel, in the act of adoring the golden Calfe,
which is indeed a separation from the false worship of the Church, but not
separate from the Church; but would you hence infer, because God punishes
fornication no less then Idolatry, that I am to separate from the Church, and
all their persons and society in the very true worship of God, because some
few persons there be fornicators and carnal? Surely then Paul did not his
duty, who commanded communion with the Church of Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. wherein
there were carnal men, and deniers of the resurrection, and such as for gain
went to the Law, with their brethren, and that before Infidels; yea because all
sin in the demerit thereof (except you devise venials) exclude men out of the
new Jerusalem, we must separate from all Churches on earth, for there be none
so clean, but there be some sin in it, which excludes out of the new
Jerusalem, as Idolatry does, though there be degrees of sin. But some
ignorant ones say the place, 1 Cor. 5. 11. is to be expounded of eating at the
Communion Table, or if it be of familiar eating and drinking, of civil
conversing, then much more are we not to communicate with them at the Lords
Table. But not to eat with such a one, is not to keep entire fellowship with
him, as the phrase notes, Psalm. 4. 9. He that eat of my bread has lift up his
b^ele against me. Joh. 13. 18. Psalm. 55 13. So does Chrysostom, The^phylact
us, Oecumenius expound this place, Bullinger, contub^^nium and interiorem
convictum prohibet; So Calvin, Peter Martyr, B^za, Piscator, Pareus; So Erasmus
and Aquinas, Haymo, Gagneius. Nor is all eating whatsoever with Heathen persons
forbidden, Paul practiced the contrary, Act. 13. 14. 5. 6. Act. 14. 8. 9. Act.
17. 16, 17. Act. 27. 34, 35, 36. Act. 28. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 10. 27.

2. The wife is not to separate, a toro and mensa, from the excommunicated
husband, nor the son from the excommunicated father, no positive Law can
cancel the Law of nature, nor can hence be concluded that it is unlawful to
keep any Church communion with these, or to separate from the communion,
though they be at the Table. 1. Because such eat damnation to themselves, not
to others. 2. Because no private person can separate, for the Churches sin,
if the man be not convicted; And lastly, here is to be observed, that if the
Church be not in its right constitution, that is, as Mr. Robinson Page 273.
teaches us, if it be not a people in whose hearts the Lord ^^th written his
covenant, we are to separate from it; so as if one be found to be a
non-converted, though not scandalous, he must be excommunicated for
non-conversion, never breaking out in scandalls, a thing contrary to the Word
of God, as I have proved already.

Mr. Robinson objecteth, Act. 2. 40. Save your self from this untoward
generation. Ans. That is, from the malicious Jews who deny Page 267.
Christ to be the Messiah. But what is this to separate from the true Church,
professing Christ?

But Robinson says, You deny visibly God, and his Son Christ. Answ. 1. Such
as are thus scandalous are to be cast out.

2. If the Church neglect to cast them out, we are not to cast out and
excommunicate the Church by separating from them, no more then the godly
forsook the Church of the Jews, where there were many scandalous persons.

3. There be great odds betwixt a froward generation professedly denying
Christ to be come in the flesh, as the Jews, Act. 2. (and from such a Church
we are to separate totally;) and betwixt a Church where there be many wicked
persons, who in their life and conversation deny Christ, and yet do believe
soundly or orthodoxly the fundamental points of salvation, and hold in
profession the orthodox faith: for though we are to separate from the bad
conversation of such a generation, yet are we not to separate from the
Church-worship, and Church-societie of such a generation: therefore Paul might
well break off communion with the Church of the Jews, whereof he was once a
member, because after Christ's death, ascension, and the Gospel was preached,
it now became a fundamental point of salvation, simply necessary to be
believed by all (That the Son of Mary was the Messiah) which because the
Jews maliciously denied, they left off to be a Church; but a scandalous life
in many of the professors, is not for that any ground to separate from the
visible Church, professing such fundamental points.

Robinson says from Job. 17. 6. 7. 9. Where the Church is said to (...). of
separation. page 269.
be given to Christ, and chosen out of the world, it is clear that the true
visible Church is gathered, by separation from the world.

But I answer, to be given to Christ and chosen out of the world is meant only
of the elect and invisible Church. But Arminians, Pelagians, and old
Anabaptists expound it of the visible Church, that they may make Judas, whom
they allege was chosen out of the world, no less then Peter, an example of
their universal election, and of the small apostasy, of the truly elected and
regenerated. And you have to side with you in this the Apostate Pet^^s Bert^u^

refuting the Arminians in the conference at Hage: and this you expressly say
with Arminians and Socinians. 1. Because, (as you say) Judas was one of them,
whom the Father had given to Christ out of the world, whom alone of all them so
given to him, he has losed; Ergo, Christ speaks of a visible donation.

Answ. The Antecedent is false, Joh. 6. 37. All that the Father had given me,
comes unto me, and him that comes unto me I will in no ways cast out, v.
39. And this is the Fathers will which ^^th sent me, that of all which he has
given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. But
Judas was cast out and losed, and is not raised up at the last day, as one
which comes, that is, believes in Christ.

2. This is the very exception of the Arminians, and Amesius answers, quae
Scriptura manifesto est judicio Iudam non it a Christo datum and commendatum
fuisse a Patre ut ^aeteros.

Christ (says Robinson) speaks of such persons as the world hated, because
they were not of the world, Job. 15. 14. But the wicked world (...) not hate
men, as they are elected before God, and invisibly or inwardly separated, ^ut
as they are outwardly separated, whether they be inwardly so or not.

Answ. 1. Invisible election and the contrary spirit that the children of God
are led by, which is most unlike to the spirit that leads the world, is the
true ground and cause why the world does hate them; and this choosing out of
the world, is seen and made visible by the fruits of the spirit to the wicked
world, but the consequence is nothing, he speaks of election that is visible
or made visible, yet not as visible for often Paul t^^rmeth the visible
Churches, Saints, Temples, of the holy Spirit, the sons and daughters of the
living God, and when he terms them such, he speaks to, and of a visible
Church, yet not as visible, because to be the temple of the holy Spirit, and a
son and daughter of the living God, is a thing formally, and properly
invisible: for faith and the spirit of adoptien are not things visible or
obvious to the senses, but Separatis^s are often deceived with this, he
speaks to the visible Saints, Ergo, he speaks to them as visible Saints,
this is the vain collection of ignorant Anabaptists; Paul writes to the
visible Church, but every privilege that he does ascribe to them does not
agree to them, as they are visible. He says to the visible Church of
Colossians, chapter 3. v. 3. your life is hid with Christ in God, an unvisible life
cannot agree to the Colossians, as they are a visible Church, so separation
from the world made manifest and visible is the cause why the world hates the
children of God, yet that separation is formally invisible and not seen to the
eye of men, for it is an action of God to choose men out of the world, and no
eye mortal can see his actions, as they be such. And therefore except Robinson
prove that this choosing out of the world is common to elect and reprobate, and
to be seen in Peter and Judas, he brings nothing against us to prove his
point, but he plainly contradicts his own tenants; for in his first reason,
he will have the true Church separated from the world, as Judas the traitor was
separated from the world, which we grant that is separation in show, and in
profession, and so makes his visible Church to be made up of traitors and
hypocrites, who cannot be the Spouse of Christ, nor a part of Christ his
mystical body, and his redeemed flock. Now he still harpeth on this, that
the visible Church rightly constitute is the Spouse of Christ, the redeemed of
God, the mystical body of Christ, and so he contradicts himself, and says
with us that there be no visible separation from the world, essential to such
a Church as they dream of, to wit, of called Saints, Temples of the holy
Spirit, etc. and therefore never one of that side understood to this day the
nature of a true visible Church, though they talk and write much of it; for
the truth is, the essence and definition of a Church agreeeth not equally to a
true Church and a visible Church, yea a visible Church as it is visible is not
formally a true Church, but the redeemed Church only is the true Church.

Lastly, He speaks (says he) of such a choosing out of the world as he does
of sending unto the world, v. 18. Which sending as it was visible and
external, so was the selection and separation spoken of.

Answ. The choosing out of the world is not opposed to sending unto the world,
for sending unto the world is an Apostolic sending common to Judas with the
rest, whereby they were sent to preach the Gospel to the world, of chosen and
unchosen, of elect and reprobate, but to be chosen out of the world, and given
to Christ, is proper to the elect only, who are chosen out of the loosed and
reprobate world.

2. It is also false that the sending of the Apostles is altogether visible,
for the gifting of them with the holy Spirit is a great part of sending the
Apostles, as our brethren say, a gifted man is a sent Prophet; but the Lord his
gifting of the Apostle is not visible.

You cannot (says Robinson) be partaker of the Lords Table and of devils.
Ergo, we must separate from the ungodly. Page 77^^


Answ. The Table of Idols is that Table of devils and of false worship kindly
in respect of the object that we must separate from, but a scandalous person
at the Lords Supper partaketh of the Table of devils by accident, in respect
the person being out of Christ eats damnation to himself, but it is not per
se and kindly, the Table of devils to others, and therefore I must not separate
from it; The Supper was to Judas the devils Table, because Satan entered in him
with a sup, to cause him to betray the Lord; and Christ told before, one of
them twelve had a devil, and so to one of the twelve the Supper was the devils
Table, yet could not the Disciples separate therefrom.

Further he objecteth, Paul condemned the Church of Corinth as kn^^ed lump,
and as contrary to the right constitution, finding so many aberrations and
defections from that state, wherein they were gathered unto a Church; who dare
open so profane a mouth as to affirm, that this faithful labourer would
plant the Lords v^neyard with such impes, or gather unto the Church flagitious
persons, drunkards, i^^es^tous persons, or such as denied the resurrection?

Answ. 1. Paul never insinuates in one letter, that these wicked persons,
marred the constitution and matter of the visible Church, but only that they
marred the constitution of the invisible Church, that being bought with a
price, they should give their bodies to harlotry, and that in denying the
resurrection they denied the Scriptures, and turned Epicures, who said, Let us
^a^e and drink, for to morrow we shall die; but there is nothing to insinuate
separation from the Church, as false in the constitution.

2. Paul does not plant wicked men as impes in the Lords Vineyard, they plant
themselves in the room of true members of the Church invisible, and as the
redeemed of God, when they are not so indeed, and this sort of planting is
given improperly to the pastors. But if you understand by planting, the casting
out of the draw-net of the word of the kingdom preached, and the inviting of
as many to come in as the Pastors do find, Matthew. 22. 9. 10. even good and
bad; this way it is the mouth of truth, and not a profane mouth, that Pastors
invite professors to come in, and be members of the visible Church, though
their act of inviting have no kindly influence in the hypocrisy of their
profession who are invited. To profess the truth is good and laudable, and to
deny it before men, damnable, and to invite men to this profession of the
truth, is good and laudable also. And wisdom sends out her maidens, and by
them inviteth simple ones and fools to profess the truth, and to come to the
visible Church, Prove. 9. 4. Prove. 1. 20, 21. but Pastors do not plant
drunkards, and flagitious persons in the visible Church, but the Apostolic
Church calling to her communion Simon Magus, Act. 8. but does not plant them as
hypocrites, but as external professors. Coachman Cry of the stone. page 5.


Mr. Coachman says, It is no wrong to leave the carnal multitude, as it was no
hurt to Jehosaphat, when Elisha in his presence protested against Joram, as
one, betwixt whom and God he would not intercede.

Answ. Put case Jehosaphat be a Church visible worshipping God aright, you
wrong his society, if you leave the shepherds tents, where Christ feeds
amongst the Lilies till the day break, because there be foxes in these tents
and wicked persons. Is it not (says he) sweeter to converse with the Godly,
then with the ungodly? Is not the presence of faithful Christians sweeter,
when one comes to power out his prayers, and offer his oblation, then the
society of carnal men?

Answ. This will prove it is lawful to separate from Pharisees preaching the
truth in Moses his chair, the contrary whereof you were, Sect. 4. Page 10.
because it is sweeter to hear the word with the Godly, then with the ungodly.

We have not found (says Coachman) the honorable name of Christians or godly
men given to liars, swearers, etc. no comfort, no privileges belong to them in
that state, it belongs not unto them, but unto us to build the house of the
Lord, Ezra 4. 3.

Answer. Yea, God bestows the privileges of external calling unto good and
bad, even to those who prefer their lusts to Christ, Matthew. 22. 9. Luke 14.
17, 18, 19.

2. The place of Ezra is corrupted, for those were the open adversaries of
Judah and Benjamin, v. 1. and were not the Church at all.

3. Only Pastors are public and authoritative builders of the Church, not
private Christians.

The wicked (says he) have the things of this life above the godly, Ergo they
should not be invested in the highest prerogatives above the godly: also it is
a presumption to say to any carnal man, This is the body of the Lord, that was
given for thee.

Answer. It is the cry of a stone to reason thus, this argument is as much
against Gods providence as against us, for God sends to Capernaum and
Bethsaida, the privilege of Christ's presence, in preaching the Gospel, and
working miracles, yet they are an unworthy people.

2. Pastors of the separation give the body of Christ to lurking Hypocrites,
are they not herein presumptuous also?

They object, To live in the want of any of Gods ordinances is not lawful, as
Matthew. 28. 20. 2 Chronicles. 30. 8. Cant. 1. 7. 8. so says Robinson. A man is not
only bound in his place to admonish Iustif. p. 201.
his neighbor, but also to see his place be such, as be may admonish his
brother; a calling absolutely tying a man to the breach of any of Gods
Commandments, is unlawful and to be forsaken.

Answ. Seeing affirmative precepts tie not ad semper, and Christian prudence is
to direct us here; there be some in Church communion whom we cannot without
palpable inconveniences rebuke: The Ministers of New England in their answer to
the n^ question, say, such as are not free (servants or sons) may stay in
paroch Assemblies in Old England, so as they partake of no corruptions, and
live not in the want of any ordinances (they mean wanting the Lords Supper)
through their default; now to separate from the Lords Supper, because of the
wickedness of the fellow-worshippers is their default, which is against
Robinson, yet we see not how masters or fathers should separate from Christ's
true Church more then servants or sons.

2. Not to admonish, in some cases, is not a breach of a Commandment, nor
living besides scandalous persons in a Church, or for any to abstain from the
seals because such be in the Church, except we would go out of the world, for
Robinson presses always personal separation, no less then Church separation.

Robinson. There is the same proportion of one member sinning, of a few, of
many, of a whole Church: now if one brother sin and will not be reclaimed, he
is no longer to be reputed a brother, but a heathen: Ergo, so are we to deal
with a Church though there be a different order, the multitude of sinners do
no ways extenuate the sin.

Answ. 1. Then may a whole Church by this reason be excommunicated, which our
brethren deny.

2. There is the same proportion to be kept when one sins, and when a whole
Church sins, but by observing due order; one may admonish a private brother,
but not any one, or many private persons, may admonish and proceed after our
Saviors order, against a whole Church in a Church way, in respect they are
still inferior to a whole Church: sister Churches and Synods are to keep this
order with one particular Church, that is incorrigible, for private persons
have relation of brotherhood to private persons, and the relation is private,
and Churches have Church relation to Churches, and the relation is public; Nor
are whole Churches to be excommunicated, while God first remove the
Candlestick, as we see in Rome, and the seven Churches in Asia.

2. It is considerable, 1. If the whole Church be obstinate and incorrigible,
or some few, or the most part.

2. If the sins be against the worship of God, as idolatry, or sins of a
wicked conversation, the worship of God remaining pure, and sound, at least in
professed fundamentals.

3. If the idolatry be essential idolatry, as the adoring of the work of men's
hands, or only idolatry by participation, as Popish ceremonies, the Surplice,
and Cross, being as means of worship, but not adored, and so being Idols by
participation; as Amesius his fresh suite against Ceremonics.
Amesius and 10. Ball his Answer to M. Cann. par. 2. page 23.
M. Ball do well distinguish, and before them, so does the learned Reynold de
Idololatria lib. 2. cap. 2.
Reynold, and Bilson of Chri. Ar. Subject. part 4. page 321, 322.
Bilson make use of the distinction.

4. All lenity must be used against a Church, if not more lenity, then we use
in proceeding against single persons.

5. Diverse degrees of separation are to be considered: hence these
considerations,

1. There is a separation Negative, or a non-union, and a separation Positive.
Though a Church of Schismatics retaining the sound faith, yet separating from
other, be deserted by any, it is a Negative separation from ^ true Church, and
laudable: as the faithful, in Augustins time, did well in separating from the
Donatists, for with them they were never one, in that faction, though they
separated not from the true faith holden by Donatists, but kept a Positive
union with them; so do all the faithful well to separate from the Churches of
the Separatists.

2. If the whole and most part of the Church turn idolatrous, and worship
Idols, (which is essential idolatry) we are to separate from that Church: the
Levites and the two Tribes did well, as Ball lo^ ci^,
Mr. Ball says, to make a separation from Jero^oams Calves; and the godly
laudably, 2 King. 16. 11. did not separate from the Israel, and Church of God,
because the Altar of Damascus was set up, and because of the high places.
Things dedicated unto Idols, as Lutheran Images, may be called, and are called
1 Cor. 10. 34. idolatry, yet are they idolatry by participation, and so the Cup
of Devils, 1 Cor. 10. Paul does not command separation from the Church of
Corinth, and the Table of the Lord there.

3. Consideration. There is a separation from the Church in the most part, or
from the Church in the least and best part. In Achabs time Israel, and the
Church thereof, for the most part, worshipped Baal; Elias, Micaja^, Obadiah,
and other godly separated from the Church of Israel in the most part: Jeremiah
wished to have a Cottage in the Wilderness (no doubt a godly wish) that he
might separate from the Church all then for the most part corrupted, yet
remained they a part of the visible Church and a part in the visible Church,
and therefore did he not separate from the Church according to the least and
best part thereof; The godly in England who refused the Popish ceremonies, and
Antichristian Bishops, did well not to separate from the visible Church in
England, and yet they separated from the mainest and worst part, which cannot
be denied to be a ministerial Church.

4. Considerat. If a Church be incorrigible in a wicked conversation, and yet
retain the true faith of Christ, it is presumed God has there some to be
saved, and that where Christ's ordinances be, there also where Christ's
ordinances be, there also Christ's Church presence is; And therefore I doubt
much if the Church should be separated from, for the case is not here as with
one simple person, for it is clear, all are not involved in that incorrigible
obstinacy, and that is yet a true visible communion, in which we are to
remain, for there is some union with the head Christ, where the faith is kept
sound, and that visibly; though a private brother remaining sound in the faith,
yet being scandalous and obstinately flagitious be to be cast off, as an
Heathen, yet are we not to deal so with an orthodox Church, where most part
are scandalous.

5. Considerat. I see not, but we may separate from the Lords Supper, where
bread is adored, and from baptism where the sign of the Cross is added to
Christ's ordinances, and yet are we not separated from the Church, for we
professedly hear the word, and visibly allow truth of the doctrine maintained
by that Church, which do pollute the Sacraments, and we are ready to seal it
with our blood, and it is an act of visible profession of a Church, to suffer
for the doctrine mentioned by that Church.

6. We may well hold that Ambros. commen. in Luc. Lib. 6. cap. 1. Signa est
ecclesia quae fidem respuat, nec Apostolicae praedicationis fundamenta
possideat, ne qua^labe^ perfidiae possit aspergere, deserenda est.
Ambrose says well, that a Church wanting the foundation of the Apostles, is
to be forsaken.

7. There is a forced separation through Tyranny from personal communion, and
a voluntary separation; David was forced to leave Israel, and was cast out of
the Inheritance of the Lord; the former is not our sin, and our separation
from Rome has something of the former, the latter would be wisely considered.

8. There may be causes of non-union with a Church, which are not sufficient
causes of separation: Paul would not separate from the Church of the Jews,
though they rejected Christ, till they openly blasphemed, Act. 13. 44, 45, 46.
Act. 18. 16. And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, Paul shook his
^ayment and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads, I am clean,
from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles. There is a lawful separation, and
yet before the Jews came to this, there was no just cause, why any should have
joined to the Church of the Jews, who denied the Messiah, and persecuted his
Servants, Act. 4. Act. 5. seeing there was a cleaner Church, to which Converts
might join themselves, Act. 2. 40, 41 42.

9. There is no just cause to leave a less clean Church (if it be a true
Church) and to go to a purer and cleaner, though one who is a Member of no
Church, have liberty of election, to join to that Church, which he conceives
to be purest and cleanest.

10. When the greatest part of a Church makes defection from the Truth, the
lesser part remaining sound, the greatest part is the Church of Separatists,
though the maniest and greatest part in the actual exercise of Discipline be
the Church; yet in the case of right Discipline, the best though sewest, is the
Church; for truth is like life, that retireth from the maniest members unto the
heart, and there remains in its fountain, in case of danger.

CHAP. 4. SECT. 6.
The way of the Churches of Christ in New England.
IN this Section the Reverend Author disputes against the Baptizing of Infants
of unbeleeving, or excommunicated neareit The way of the Churches of Christ in
New England.

Chap. 4. Sect. 6.


Parents, of which I have spoken in my former Treatise: Only here I vindicate,
our Doctrine. And first the Author is pressed with this, the excommunicated
persons want indeed the free passage of life, and virtue of the Spirit of
Jesus, till they be tuitched with repentance, yet they are not wholly cut off
from the society of the faithful, because the seed of faith remains in them,
and that knitteth them in a bond of conjunction with Christ. The Author
answers, It is true, such excommunicates, as are truly faithful, remain in
Covenant with God, because the seed of faith remains in them, yet to the
society of the faithful joined in a particular visible Church, they are not
knit, but wholly cut off from their communion, for it is not the seed of faith,
nor faith it self, that knitteth a man to this, or that particular Church, but
a holy profession of the Faith, which when a man has violated by a grievous
sin, and is delivered to Satan, he is now, not as a dead palsie-member, cut
off from the body, though be may remain a member of the invisible Church of
the first borne, yet he has neither part, nor portion, nor fellowship in the
particular visible Church of Christ Jesus, but is as an heathen and a publican:
now Sacraments are not given to the invisible Church, nor the members thereof,
as such, but to the visible particular Churches of Jesus Christ, and therefore
we dare no more baptize his child, than the child of an heathen.

I Answer, First, if Faith remain in some excommunicated person, (as you
grant) it must be seen in a profession, for though for some particular
scandal, the man be excommunicated, yet is he not cut off (as we now suppone)
for universal apostasy from the truth to Gentilisine, or Judaisme, for then
he should be cursed with the great excommunication, 1 Cor. 16. v. 22. and so
though he be to the Church as a heathen, in that act, yet is he not to the
visible Church an heathen, but a brother, and to be admonished as a brother, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 15. and the Church is to use excommunication as a medicine, with
intention to save his Spirit in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. 1 Timothy 1.
20. an excommunicated apostate is not so: now if he retain faith to the
Churches decerning, he retains the profession of Faith, and in so far a
visible membership, with the Church in the Covenant; Ergo, for that professed
Faith, by our brethrens grant, his child should be baptized, and so is not
wholly cut off, but is as a dead palsy member of the Church, and so as a
member, though in a deliquie, and Lethargy.

2. You say to the faithful of a particular Church, the excommunicate is
wholly cut off: What do you mean? if his sins be bound in heaven, (as they
are, if he justly be excommunicated) is he not also cut off, to all the visible
Churches on earth^ are not all the Churches to repute him as a publican and a
heathen? I believe they are, but you deny in this all visible communion of
Chur^hes.

3. You say, it is not the seed of Faith that knitteth a man to a particular
visible Church, but an holy profession. But in the excommunicate person, (if
the seed of faith remain as you grant) this faith must be seen, by you, in a
holy profession, else to you, he has no seed of faith; and if his profession
of faith remain entire, though it be violated in the particular obstinate,
remaining in one scandal, for the which he is excommunicated, you have no
reason to say, that to the particular Church, he is wholly cut off, since his
profession remains.

4. You say, It is not the seed of faith, nor faith it self that knitteth a
man to this or that particular visible Church, but a holy profession of faith.
Then I say, one may be knit to a particular visible Church, and a true member
thereof, though he want both the seed of Faith, and Faith it self. I prove the
connection. A man is a perfect and true member of a Church, though he want that
which does not knit him to the Church, this is undeniable: But without the seed
of Faith or Faith it self, (as you say) he is knit to the true Church: Ergo.
But this is contrary to your Doctrine, who require, chap. 3. sect. 3. that none
must be admitted members of a visible Church, but those who are Christ his
body, the habitation of God by the Spirit, the Temples of the Holy Ghost, etc.
And that no^ only by external^ profession, but in some measure of sincerity
and Truth. Now consider my Reverend Brethren, if there be a measure of
sincerity and Truth, where there is neither the seed of Faith, nor Faith it
self: and surely by this you cast down and mar the constitution of your
visible Church, when you exclude from the members thereof, the seed of Faith,
and Faith it self; and you come to our hand, and teach, that the seed of
Faith, and Faith it self, is accidental to a visible Church as visible, which
we also teach: and so there is no measure of truth and sincerity required to
the essential constitution of a visible Church.

5. But I would gladly learn how you contra-distinguish these two, Faith, and
a holy profession of Faith? Do you imagine that there can be a holy profession
knitting a man to the visible Church, where there be neither the seed of Faith,
nor Faith it self? It is Arminian holiness, which is destitute of Faith, but
if you mean by a holy profession, a profession conceived to be holy, though it
be not so indeed, then you do yet badly contradivide a holy profession from
faith, for before any can be knit as a member to the visible Church, you are to
conceive him to be a Saint, a Believer, and so to have both the seed of Faith,
and Faith it self, though indeed he have neither of the two, and so Faith is
as well that which knitteth a man as a member to the visible Church, as
holiness.

6. If he remain a member of the universal Church of the first borne, is he
therefore so as a heathen, and so that you dare no more receive him to the
Supper, nor his seed to baptism, nor you dare receive a heathen, and his seed
to the Seals of the Covenant? is a heathen a member of the invisible Church of
the first borne? but the excommunicated you presume is such a one.

7. What warrant have you for this Doctrine, That the Sacraments are not given
to the invisible Church, as it is such, but to the visible? Certainly, God
ordains the Sacraments to the believers as believers, and because they are
within the Covenant, and their interest in the Covenant, is the only true
right of interest to the Seals of the Covenant, profession does but declare
who believe and who believe not, and consequently, who have right to the Seals
of the Covenant, and who not, but profession does not make right, but declares
who have right.

The Author subjoyneth, Christ gives no due right unto baptism to the child,
but by the Fathers right unto the Covenant and communion of the Church, so by
taking away right unto the Covenant and Communion of the Church from the
Father, he takes away the childrens right also, the personal sin of the
parent in this case is not a mere private personal sin, but the sin of a
public person of his family: for as his profession of his faith at his
receiving unto the Church, was as the profession of a public person receiving
him and his children, who could make no profession but by his mouth unto the
Church, so his violation of his profession by a scandalous cri^^, was as a
public violation thereof for himself and his seed, who stand or fall before
the Church in his name and his person.

Answ. 1. It is true, Christ gives right to baptism to the child, by the
Fathers right. I distinguish that, by the nearest father only I deny, by the
right of fathers in general, true; but then it will follow, that no infant is
to be debarred from baptism for the sins of his nearest parents, for if
these who are descended of Abraham and David, many generations upward from
them, were within the Covenant, and so had right to circumcision, for the
Covenant made with David and Abraham, and the nearest fathers sin is not the
cause of taking away the right to the Covenant from the child, and right to the
Church Communion.

2. I much doubt if the child have right to the seals of the Covenant, for the
faith of the father, and so I deny that he loses right to the seals of the
Covenant for the fathers scandalous crime, which is a violation of the
Covenant. I do reverence grave and learned divines, who speak so;
Oecolampadius in Epist.
Oecolampadius, and Zuinglius lib. 2. page 301, 302.
Zuinglius say that Insants are sanctified by their parents faith; but I
conceive they take the word faith objectively, for the doctrine of faith
profeffed by the father, and not subjectively. But I think that great Divine
Beza quaest. and ^esp lib 126. Nequaqu^n tamen facile dixc^^m, quempiam aliena
fide servari, nequis hoc peri^de accipiat, ac si d x^rim, parentum fidem
imputari infantibus, quasi aliena side credentibus; quod quidem non minus
falsum and absurdum fuerit, quam si dixerim, quempiam posse aliena anima
vivere, aut alterius sapientia sapere.
Beza says well, that no man is saved by another man's faith, nor can the
parents faith be imputed to the children, which is no less absurd, nor to say
that one man lives by the soul and life of another man, and that he is wise
by the wisdom of another man: how then are Infants within the Covenant for
their parents?

I answer, for the faith of their fathers, that is, for the Covenant of their
fathers they have right to baptism, for that I will be thy God, and the God of
thy seed, Galat. 3. 8. comprehends all the believing Gentiles. And for this
cause the children of Papists and excommunicate protestants which are borne
within our visible Church are baptized, if their forefathers have been found
in the faith; and I think the reason is given by Doct. Morton his appeal,
lib. 4. cap. 6. sect. 1. page 464.
Doctor Morton, who says, The children of all Papists, Anabaptists, or other
Heretics, are to be distinguished from the children of Turks and Pagans,
because the Parents of Papists and Anabaptists have once been dedicated to
Christ in baptism, and the child (says he) has only interest in that part
of the Covenant, which is sound and Catholic, while as the parents themselves
stand guilty of heresy, which by their own proper and actual consent, they
have added unto the Church.

And I think the Scripture says here with us, that the nearest parents be not
the only conveyers and propagators of federall holiness to the posterity,
Psalm. 106. 35. They were mingled with the heathen and learned their works, 36.
and they served their Idols, etc. 44. Nevertheless he regarded their
affliction, 45. and he remembered, for them, his covenant. What Covenant? His
Covenant made with Abraham, and yet their nearest fathers sinned, v. 6. We have
sinned and our fathers, v. 7. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt,
they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies, but provoked him at the Sea,
even at the red Sea, v. 8. Nevertheless be saved them for his names sake. His
name was the glory of the Covenant made with Abraham, by which his name and
truth, by promise was engaged, Esa. 63. 10. But they rebelled and vexed his
holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought
against them, v. 11. Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people,
saying, Where is he that led them, and brought them out of the red Sea? So also
Esaias 51. 1, 2, 3. and most evidently, Ezekiel. 20. 8. They rebelled against me,
etc. But I wrought for my names sake, that it should not be polluted before the
heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made my self known unto them,
in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

Now this name is to be expounded his Covenant, Jerem. 31. 32. which he made
with them, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, which Covenant is
extended unto the Christian Church, Heb. 8. 8. 9, 10. Now if God gave right
unto the sons of the Jews, I mean federall right, to temporal deliverance,
and the means of grace, for the Covenant made with Abraham, though their
nearest parents rebelled against the Lord, that same Covenant in all the
privileges thereof indureth yet, yea and is made to all the Gentiles, ^al. 3.
8. Heb. 8. 8, 9, 10. for it is the covenant national made with the whole race,
not with the sons upon the condition of the nearest parents says, as is
clear after Christ's ascension unto heaven, Act. 2. 39. For the promise is to
you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even to as many as
the Lord our God shall call. Now it is clear that their fathers killed the
Prophets, Matthew. 23. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. they were a wicked generation
under blood, v. 37.

2. It is clear that these externally, and in a federall and Church profession
have right ecclesiastic to the Covenant, to whom the external calling of the
preached Gospel does belong, while he says the promise (of the Covenant) is
made to as many as the Lord our God shall call, so the called nation, though
the nearest parents have killed the Prophets, and rejected the calling of God,
Matthew. 23. 33. 34. 37. is the nation which have external and Church-right to
the promises and Covenant, and Romans 11. 28. As concerning the Gospel they are
enemies for your sake, but as touching the election they are beloved for the
fathers sake: now their nearest fathers maliciously opposed the Gospel,
therefore it must be for the election of the holy nation, in which respect, the
nation of the Jews, v. 16. was a holy seed, and a holy root, and the children
were also the holy branches, holy with the holiness of the Covenant; and
Joshua had no reason to circumcise the people at Gilgal, for the holiness of
their nearest parents, whose earcasses fell in the wilderness, yet he
circumcised them, to take away the reproach of his people; now this reproach
was uncircumcision in the flesh, the reproach of the Philistims, (so Goliath is
called an uncircumcised Philistim) and of all the nations without the Covenant
of God: yea by this there were no reason to circumcise the sons of Achab and
Jezabel, whose nearest parents were slaves to Idolatry, and who were bloody
persecutors of the Prophets; nor was there reason to circumcise Jeroboams
son, in whom there was some good, for both father and mother were wicked
Apostates: and very often, by this doctrine, should the people of the Jews
leave off to be the visible Church, and so the promise of the Covenant should
fail in the line from Abraham to David, and from David to Christ; even so often
as the nearest parents did evil in the sight of the Lord; and many times
should God have cast off his people whom be foreknew; contrary to that which
Paul says, Romans 11. 1, 2, 3. To these I add, if the infants of the Christian
Church have only right to baptism, through the faith of the nearest parents
only, then is this to be conceived either to be true and saving faith, in the
nearest parents, or only faith in profession: if you say the former, then 1.
The seed of the excommunicated parents, in whom is faith, or the seed thereof
is to be baptized, the contrary, of which you affirm.

2. Then the seed and Infants of no Parents, but of such only as are members of
the invisible Church of the first borne, are to be baptized, the contrary
whereof you teach, while you say, The Sacraments are not given to the invisible
Church, and the members thereof, but to the visible particular Churches.

3. The Infants of the unbeleeving parents, though members of the visible
Church, have no right to baptism, and the Covenant, though they be the elect
of God, and borne within the visible Church, which is admirable to us, now it
is known that Hypocrites and unbeleeving parents have often such a luster of a
green and fairelike profession, as that they go for visible members of the
Church, so as their children are by Christ's warrant and right baptized. I come
to the other point, if the faith of nearest parents, only true in profession
and show before men, give right to their Infants to be sealed with the seals
of the Covenant: Then 1. apparent and bypocriticall faith conferreth true right
to the seals to Infants, and there is not required (as the author says Chap.
3. Sect. 3.) that the members of the visible Church be the called of God, the
sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty, not only in external Chap. 3.
Sect. 3.
profession, but also in some measure of sincerity and truth.

2. God has warranted his Church to put his seal upon a falsehood, and to
confer the seals upon Infants, for the external profession of faith, where
there is no faith at all, this your writers think inconvenient and absurd.

Also it is objected by us, that excommunicates children are in no better case
by this doctrine, then the children of Turks and Infidels.

The Author answers. We willingly (says he) put a difference; excommunicates
are nearer to helps, and means of salvation and conversion, then Turks, 1
Cor. 5. 5. because excommunication it self is a mean that the spirit may be
saved: and Turks are nearer then Apostates, who turn enemies to the truth,
for better never have known the way of truth, then to turn back. But in this
they agree, they are all of them as Heathen, Matthew. 18. and therefore neither
parents nor children have right to the seals.

Answ. This is not an answer, for the Infants of excommunicates, though they be
the seed of ancestors, as grandfathers, who were true believers, yet as infants
and dying in Infancy, are no less without the Covenant, and excluded from the
seals thereof, by you then the Infants of Turks.

2. The Infants of nearest parents in the Jewish Church, though wicked, were
not excluded from circumcision, nor were they in the case of the Infants of the
profane heathen; and the same covenant made to the Jews and their seed, is
made to us, and to our seed, Gal. 3. 8. Heb. 8. 9. 10. Romans 11. 27. 28. Act. 2.
38, 39. We also affirm, that the Lord extends the mercy of the Covenant to a
thousand generations, and therefore the line 2. Commandment, Exodus 20.
of the covenant-mercy is not broken off, for the unbeleefe of the nearest
parents. Our Author answers.

Is the extension of Gods mercy to a thousand generations be a sufficient
ground to extend baptism to the Children of excommunicates in the right of
their ancestors, it may suffice as well to the children of Turks and Insidels,
and Apostates, for it is not above sixty and six generations from Noah to
Christ, as is plain in the Genealogy, Luke 3. 13. and there have not passed
as many more generations from Christ's time Answers to the 32. questions sent
from Old England to New England.
to the Turks, and Infidels of the present age. And all will not amount (say
they in their answers) to the sum of two hundred generations. The true
meaning is, that God out of his abundant and rich mercy may and does extend
thoughts of redeeming and converting mercy and grace unto thousand generations,
but he never allows his Church any warrant to receive unto their Covenant and
communion the children of godly parents, who lived a thousand years ago, much
less a thousand generations; nay rather the Text is plain, 1 Cor. 7. 14. that
the holiness of the children depends upon the next immediate parents, to wit,
upon such faith as denominateth them believers in opposition to Pagans and
Infidels, and that holiness to the children is called federall, which
receives them unto the Covenant and seals thereof.

Answ. 1. We stand not on the number of a thousand precisely, nor does the holy
Ghost intend that, for as it is usual in Scripture, a 1 Samuel 1. 8.

Revel. 1. 4.

Psalm. 12. 6.

Prove. 24. 16. 25.

Esaias 4. 1.

Psalm. 3. 6.

definite number is put for an indefinite: Wrath follows the Ammonite and
Moabite to the tenth generation, Deuteronomy. 23. 2, 3. and the Edomite and Egyptian
though cursed, enters into the Congregation of the Lord, the third
generation, v. 7. 8. The Lord here walks in a latitude, yet so as the mercy
of the Covenant is extended to more generations, a thousand for four, beyond
the anger of God to the generation of the wicked; nor does the Authors
consequence stand good, that then we had right and warrant to baptize the
children of Turks, Pagans and Indians, (as for one single Apostate, I account
him as one single excommunicate Christian in this point) because the Lords
comparison of proportion holds in generations of the same kind, and is
restricted to the generations within the visible Church, shows mercy unto
thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments, which must be
extended to professed love of a nation that is federally holy. Now Turks and
Indians are neither lovers of God, nor in profession, through federall
holiness such; and it is most pregnant against such as confine and imprison
the mercy of the Covenant toward poor Infants, to their next immediate
parents, and by the Authors interpretation, the thousand generations to which
God extends mercy, is confined to one, because if the wicked two, the father
and mother be violaters of the Covenant, though nine hundredth foregoing
generations have been lovers of God, yet the Covenant mercy is interrupted to
the innocent Infants, (in this innocent) and they are translated over to the
class and roll of the children of Turks and Pagans under the curse and wrath
of God for hundredth of generations. The Lord in this having a respect to that
people whom he brought out of the Land of Egypt, in whom he fulfilled this
promise of showing mercy to many generations, though their nearest parents were
grievers of his holy Spirit, and rebellers against him: for Abraham, Isaac and
Jacobs sake, cannot be so narrow and pinched in mercy to the posterity, as to
reduce a thousand generations to one, as this Author would have him to do.

2. It is a hungry extention of mercy, as the Author exponeth it, to Gods
extending of thoughts, of redeeming and converting to a thousand generations,
which he has to Turks; for these thoughts of redeeming are from the free and
absolute decree of election to glory, but this is an express promise of
extending the mercy of the Covenant to a thousand generations, and such as the
Lord by necessity of his veracitie and faithfulness of covenant, cannot
contraveene.

3. The place 1 Cor. 7. is corrupted contrary to the Apostles intent, which is
to resolve a case of conscience, whether the believing wife married on a Pagan
husband, or a believing husband married on a Pagan wife should divorce and
separate, because the seed would seem by Gods Law to be unclean, Para 9. 2.
Paul answers, if one be holy and profess the faith, the (...) is holy, v.
14. whereas if both father and mother were Pagans and heathen, the seed should
be unholy, and void of federall holiness, then were the children unclean.
But the consequence is frivolous, if both be Pagans, and Heathen, and
unbeleevers (for so the Author does well expound the unbeleeving husband) then
the seed is unclean and void of federall holiness. But it follows not:
Ergo, if both the Christian Parents be excommunicated, and be scandalous and
wicked, they are not members of a parishionall visible Church, then are the
children unclean and void of all federall holiness, and have no right to the
seals of the covenant. We deny this connection, for there be great odds betwixt
the children of Turks, and children of excommunicated and scandalous parents.
The children of Turks and Heathen are not to be baptized, but the children of
excommunicates, are as Turks and Heathen; Ergo, the children of excommunicates
are not to be baptized. The Syllogism is vicious in its sorme; 2. It fails
in its matter, for children of excommunicates, because of the Covenant made
with their ancestors, are in Covenant with God, and the children of Turks are
not so.

The Author adds, The wickedness of the parents does not (...) the election
or redemption, or the Faith of the child: (...) a Bastard is reckoned in the
Catalogue of believers, He^^^nes 11. 32. Yet a bastard was not admitted to come
unto (...) Congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation, Deuteronom. ^3. 2.

Answ. It is true, the want of baptism is no hazard to the salvation of the
child, nor do we urge that the infants of excommunicates, should be baptized,
because we think baptism necessary, necessitate medii, as Papists do, but
neither we nor Papists, nor any except Anabaptists, and the late Belgi^^e
Arminians and Socinians, as Episcopius disp. priv. 29.

Socinus deny baptism to be necessary in respect of Gods Commandment; and
indeed if you urge the constitution of a visible Church, as you do of members
called of God, and Saints, not only in external profession, but also in some
measure of sincerity and truth, as you do expressly say (e) in this Treatise,
we see not how you can hold that Infants can be baptized at all while they come
to age, and can give tokens to the Church of their faith, and conversion to
God, for if they believe not, you put Gods seal upon a blanke, which you
think absurd.

In the closing of this Section, the Author reasons against Godfathers,
which are to us of civil use, and no part of baptism: He alleges, he
knows not any ground at all to allow a The way of the Churches of Christ in
New England, Chap. 3. Sect. 3.
faithful man liberty to entitle another man his child, to baptism, only
upon a pretense of a promise, to have an eye to his education, unless the
child be either borne in his house or resigned to him, to be brought up in his
house as his own.

I Answer, 1. The Infants of believing Fathers absent in other Lands, upon
their lawful callings, are by this holden from the Seal of the Covenant, as
if they were the Children of Pagans, for no fault in the Parents.

2. A promise of education in the Christian faith is here made a sufficient
ground for baptizing an Infant, whereas always before the Author contendeth
for an holy profession of faith in both, or at the least in one of the nearest
parents, but we know that a friend may undertake the Christian education of the
child of an excommunicate person, who is to you as the child of a Pagan, we
think, upon such a promise, you could not baptize the child of a Turk: Ergo,
excommunicated persons and Turks are not alike, as you say.

offense.

Answ. What if a member of your Church do ^how himself in private, to some
brethren, to be a non-regenerated person, and so indeed not a member of the
visible Church, by your doctrine, he should be excommunicated for
non-regeneration, which is against Christ's way, Matthew. 18. who will have such
sins as, if denied, may be proved by two witnesses, only to be censurable by
the Church, else you shall retain such an one, and admit him to profane the
Table of the Lord.

In this first and second Section I have nothing to examine but what has been
handled already, especially the Peoples power in Church-affaires has been
fully discussed; only the Author will have the preaching of the word, a
worship not pecu^iar to the Church, but commune to those who are not in the
Church State at all, and that ordinarily in respect that Indians and Heathens
may come and hear the Word, 1 Cor. 14. but this proves not but that preaching
of the word is proper and peculiar to the Church: but there is another mystery
here, as from the first chapter, second Section, then preaching of the word is
to be performed by gifted persons, yea ordinary preaching for the conversion of
Souls, before there be any Pastors in the Church to Preach. Hence is that.

Quest. I. Whether conversion of souls to Christ, be ordinarily the proper
fruit and effect of the word preached by a sent Pastor; or if it be the (...)
and effect of the word preached by Pastors not as Pastors, but as (...) to
preach, and so of all persons not in office, yet gifted to preach?

The Churches of New England in their Answers to the thirty two Questions, sent
by the Ministers of Old- England, Answer Quaest. 29.
by certain Theses, which I set down and examine.

1. The conversion of sinners follows not always the preaching of every one
that is in lawful office of the Ministry.

2. When conversion does follow, it does not follow from the preaching of a
Pastor, or by virtue of his office, but by the blessing of God.

Answ. 1. The former reason is most weak, conversion follows not always upon
Christ's preaching, and the Apostles their preaching did not always produce
conversion: but I pray you because they were not efficacious means of
conversion, does it follow, Therefore they were not ordinary means? I think
not.

2. The second is as weak, Conversion follows not upon the preaching of a
Pastor by virtue of his office, but by the blessing of God. What? Ergo,
Pastoral preaching is not an ordinary mean of conversion? neither does
conversion follow upon preaching, by virtue of the gift, no more then by virtue
of the office, but by the blessing of God: Ergo, neither is preaching of a
gifted man, the ordinary mean of conversion, as you teach, nor are the
Sacraments by this reason, ordinary means to seal up our communion with
Christ, and the graces of the Covenant, for Sacraments are efficacious means
only by the blessing of God, and not by virtue of the office; We do not hold
that the office has influence, either in the word preached, or in the Souls
of people, but it follows not that the Pastoral preaching of these who are
sent, Romans 10. 14. Esa. 40. 9. and that with Pastoral authority, are not the
means appointed of God for conversion, but here they confound means, actu
primo, lawful and ordinary, with means efficacious, and, in actu secundo,
blessed with success from the Lord.

This we acknowledge (say they) that sound conversion of sinners, argues that
the instruments of such conversion were sent of God, Romans 10. 14, 15. Jer. 23.
32. yet we dare not say that Gods word is not effectual to conversion, unless
the man that speaks it be a Minister, that is, a Church Officer, the contrary
being evident, Joh. 4. 10. Act. 8. 4. Matthew. 11. 19, 21. 1 Cor. 7. 16. and to
say so, mere to limit the Spirit of God, where he has not limited himself. 1
Cor. 12. 11. 1 Cor. 1. 27. 29.

Answ. 1. Sending Romans 10. 14. is an official and authoritative sending, not
only a bare gifting and habilitating of the man sent, for it is such a
sending, as the sending of Prophets, whose feet were pleasant upon the
mountains, and the watchmen who lift up their voice, Esa. 52. 7, 8. Nah. 1.
15. and this is not a naked gifting, but besides they were commanded by God to
speak, and so had authority: now though private Christians be instruments of
conversion, yet it follows no ways, that they are preachers sent of God, in
the sense that the Scripture speaks, Romans 10. 14. 15. and far less in the
sense that is spoken, Jer. 23. 32. for it is said these who prophecy lies in
Gods name, and were not sent, shall profit the people nothing; now the sending
denied to be in these false teachers, is not only want of gifts, but want of
an authoritative command of God to preach, as is clear, v. 21. I have not sent
these Prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken unto them, yet they
prophesied. When it is said, The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, to Ezekiel,
etc. the meaning is not that Jeremiah was gifted only, but beside (...), an
hability to prophecy, the Lord gave him (...), authority by a special
Commandment, saying, Go speak, Lo I have sent thee, etc. Now this immediate
Commandment from God himself speaking from heaven, or in a vi^on, is not in
the Churches of the New Testament, yet God speaks by the Elders and
Presbytery to Pastors now, 1 Timothy 4. 14. 1 Timothy 5. 22. Tit. 1. 9. 10. except
you I say with Arminians and Socinians, there is no need now of the Churches
sending, all gifted may preach the Gospel, without any Church-call.

3. This consequence is loose, conversion of sinners argues that the
instruments were sent of God; Ergo, the Preaching of Pastors ^^ Pastors is not
the ordinary mean of conversion.

Lastly, We deny not but private Christians may be instruments of conversion,
but the places which afterward shall be examined, prove not the point, that
Pastoral preaching, in a constitute Church, is not the ordinary mean, but
your Doctrine is that Pastors as Pastors do only confirm those in the faith,
who are already converted, but that they convert none at all, as Pastors, but
that the only ordinary means of conversion, and of planting of men in formal
state of Church Membership are men gifted to preach, and not Pastors by office;
Sending (say they) sometimes imports but an act of Gods providence, whereby
men are gifted, and permitted to do such a thing, though they be not commanded
of God, nor do in obedience to God, but for sinisterous ends, so God sent the
King of Assyria, Esaias 10. 6. 2 King. 24. 2. So they that preached of envy,
Phil. 1. 15. are sent: So Balaam was sent. 2. Some are sent who beside gifts
and permission, have also a sincere mind to employ their gifts, God by his
Spirit stirring them up, 1 John 7. 18. 3. Those are sent of God, who have both
gifts, permission, and a sincere mind to employ their gifts, and withal a
lawful calling to the office: if men want a lawful calling to that office of
the ministry, and are not sent of God the third way, yet may they preach and
convert souls, as sent of God, the first and second way.

Answ. 1. There should have been places of Scripture to prove that Balaam and
the enviers of Paul, Phil. 1. 15. who preached Christ of envy, were sent the
first way: for Balaam prophesied of the Star of Jacob, as one lawfully sent
and a called Prophet, as all other Prophets, (though he was not a gracious
man) for Numb. 24. 2. Balaam saw the visions of God, and the Spirit of God came
upon him. 4. He saw the visions of the Almighty, and fell in a trance: and
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel had no other calling as Prophets, though in zeal and
simplicity of prophesying, they differed from Balaam: and Paul would never
have rejoiced that these teachers preached Christ, Phil. 1. 15. if they had
without all calling of God preached Christ; doubtless they had a calling of
the Church to preach, except you think that none have a calling, as called
pastors, but those who are converted.

3. By this distinction you hold that men may be ordinary Preachers gifted, and
so sent of God to preach, and may and do convert souls, though they have no
calling of the Church; which unsound doctrine the Arminians and Socinians hold
this day: for they teach,

1. That all gifted persons may preach the Gospel, and convers souls.

2. That all who are gifted to preach, are sent and lawfully called to preach,
though the Church do not call them.

3. That now since the Gospel is sufficiently revealed, and the Apostles are
dead, there is required no calling of the Church, to make one a Lawful
minis^er: And your Arguments they have, and you have their Arguments to evert
all ministry and order of calling of pastors; so teach the Arminians, and so
Episcopius; disp. 26. these. 4. 5. Necessitatem missionis jam cessare dicendum

Quest. II. Whether or not all gifted persons may preach the Word of God
publicly, and ordinarily, for the gathering in of souls to Christ, though
they be destitute of all official authority, or Church calling to that
ministry?

Our brethren hold all gifted persons not in office may ordinarily preach
publicly; So teach Mr. Robinson in a Treatise entitled The peoples ple t for
prophesying, the Arguments of which book I shall shortly discuss. Hence these
considerations.

1. Distinct. There is one power of public preaching in a Church not
constitute, and another in a Church constitute; gifted persons in extraordinary
cases, where a Church is not planted, may publicly preach, but the case is
otherwise in a Church constituted.

2. Distinct. Pastors not only as gifted men, but as Pastors are ^illed of
God, for the conversion of souls, and the visible Church is Christ's visible
kingdom, and visible society, to make persons members of the invisible Church
of the first borne.

3. Did. Public preaching, as it is the ordinary mean of saving such as
believe, is proper and peculiar to the Church, both subjectively, as being
only in the Church, and objectively as being only exercised on the Church
members, perse, but upon P^gans by accident.

4. Did. There is a call to an habitual and ordinary prophe^ying, here is
required not only a calling by gifts, but also a collation of authority to
the office, either immediately by God, or mediately by the Church, and there is
a call to some particular or occasional acts of exhorting, as the Martyrs and
Stephen are called to give consession of their faith, and a King in battle, to
exhort his army, or a Prince his Subjects to piety, and to this latter there is
no other call required, but the place and profession of the exhorter, though
he be not by office a Pastor.

5. Did. There is a formal calling of the Church, as the laying on of the
hands of the Elders, and a virtuall and interpretative calling or tacit
approbation of the Church, when learned men of eminent gifts, not in office, do
write Commentaries, Sermons on Canonick Scriptures, and tractates resuting
heresies; to this the tacit approbation of the Church is required, but these
have not ordinary pastoral care, nor are they the ordinary converters of
souls to Christ, as the pretended Prophets of Separatists are.

6. Did. Gifted Christians may occasionally admonish, warn, rebuke and exhort
one another; 1. privately; 2. without any Pastoral care of souls as they are
a Church, but only as they occasionally converse with them; 3. Excommuni
officio charitatis, by the Law of nature, charity tying one member to help
another; 4. Not authoritatively by special office; but all authority here is
from the word occasionally spoken. The Pastor is to preach, 1. Publicly; 2. To
the Church as the Church. 3. With a pastoral obligation to all alike, whether
he converse daily with them or not. 4. Not only by the tie of common Charity,
but by a virtue of a special office. 5. With authority both objective from the
word, and official from his charge. 6. And is obli^ged to separate himself
for this charge allanerly, as a watchman who must give an account in a special
manner to Jesus Christ.

Our brethren hold that the ordinary and established way in the Church of
Christ to the end of the world, is that all that are converted are made fit
materials for the visible Church by private Christians, as gifted of God to
preach publicly, and to gather a true Church to Christ. 2. That none
unconverted, as they are such, are under any pastoral care of Christ's
officers. 3. That Pastors as Pastors, do convert none, but only confirm
those who are already converted; and that if Pastors shall convert any to
Christ, it is by accident, as we say, with Aristotle, Musicus curat aegrotum, a
Musician cures a sick man, which he does no ways as a musician: for Pastors
do convert as gifted persons, and not as Pastors, and conversion of souls is
no proper Church-worke, but accidental to Pastors.

But that none can take on him lawfully to preach the Word publicly, in the
established and ordinarily approved way of Christ for the conversion of souls,
but he who is not only gifted, but also called thereunto by God and his Church,
I prove.

1. Argum. If faith come ordinarily by hearing a Pastor sent of God, and such
Pastors as are called messengers with good news, and watchmen not only
gifted, but also instructed with authority of office, then are not gifted
persons, because gifted, called of God to be ordinary converters of souls. But
the former is true, Romans 10. 14. for they are (...), and of these the Prophet
says, Isa. 52. 8. Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice. And it is thus
confirmed, That Gospel which is the power of (...)
God and the wisdom of God to those who are saved, is the Gospel preached by
such as are sent both to preach and baptize: but (...)
the Gospel preached by gifted men, only out of office, is not the Gospel
preached by those who are sent both to preach and to baptize: Ergo, the Gospel
preached by only gifted persons void of all office, is not the power and
wisdom of God to those who are saved. The assumption is granted, for gifted men
out of office may not lawfully baptize. I prove the proposition, 1 Cor. 1. 23.
but we preach Christ, etc. That this [wee] is to be understood of those who
are sent both to preach and baptize, is clear, verse. 17. But Christ sent me
not to baptize, but to preach, that is, he sent me not to baptize principally,
Ergo, in one and the same Patent from heaven, Paul was warranted to preach, and
to baptize, as one commission is given, Matthew. 28. 19. to teach all Nations,
and to baptize, yea it is (...) then it is such a preaching as must be backed
with the sealing by baptism; also if he had meant that preaching was not
peculiar to Apostles and other successors, he should have said. But yet preach
Christ crucified, etc. for Separatists do teach, with Socinians, that there was
a multitude of unofficed Prophets at Corinth.

Robinson, as if he had learned in Socinus his school, says to Robinson, the
peoples pea for the exercise of prophesying against Mr. Yates, Arg. 2. page 6.
this, But for the word sending which he so much urges, it must be known,
that all who teach lawfully are sent by Christ, in respect of their personal
gifts and graces, so ordinary officers are not sent by those who appoint them
to minister, as was the extraordinary Apostles sent by Christ who appointed
them. Sending imports a passes of the sent from the sender to another, and
so the Apostles were sent by Christ to preach the Gospel to the Jews and
Gentiles, and so are not Pastors sent by the Church (which calls them) unto
others, but to minister unto her self, after the exercise of public ministry
is ended, the Church do publicly exhort and require, as the Rulers do Paul
and Barnabas, Act 13. 14. that if they have any word of exhortation, they would
say on.

Answ. Surely Mr. Yates, and we both have much for us to urge the necessity
of sending, except men would run unsent, and so be guilty of intrusion, for
so does the Scripture, Exodus 28. 1. Take to thee Aaron thy brother, etc. Numb.
1. 49. Thou shall appoint the Levits over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and
over all the vessels, and all that belongs thereunto: so says Hezekiah to
the Levites, The Lord has chosen you to stand before him, and to minister unto
him: Esaias 6. 8. And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send,
and who shall go for me? 9. and he said, go and say to this people, Jerem.
1. 4. And the Word of the Lord came unto me, saying, v. 5. Hos. 1. 1. and the
Word of the Lord came to me, Heb. 1. 1. Joh. 1. 6. There was a man sent of God,
Luke 3. 2. Matthew. 10. 5. Those twelve Jesus sent forth, Isa. 48. 16. Isa. 61.
1. Heb. 5. 4. Joh. 20. 21. Matthew. 28. 19. Mark 16. 15. Romans 11. 1. Romans 1. 1.
Gal. 1. 1. Act. 14. 13. Paul and Barnabas ordained Elders in every Church, 1 Timothy 4. 14. 1 Timothy 5. 22. 2 ^im. 2. 2, 3. Tit. 1. 9, 10. If you urge not
sending, you go from the Scriptures.

2. He says all who lawfully teach are sent of God in respect of personal
gifts. But 1. where does the holy Ghost speak so in the Scripture? All then
who have gifts to be Kings and Magistrates are sent of God to the throne and
bench? what bloody confusions would hence fellow? Yea if they have gifts to be
Kings and do not all fly to the throne, they resist the calling of God, and
sin in so doing, as Jonah did, and hide their Lords Talent. 2. Women in whose
lips is the Law of grace, Prove. 31. 26. and who are to teach the younger
women, Tit. 2. 3. 4. are so sent of God to preach; O but (say they) they are
forbidden to preach. I answer, true, then (to be gifted to preach:) is not all
one with this (to be sent to preach) for to be sent to preach of God, is to
be commanded to preach. If then women be sent in respect of gifts, they are
commanded to preach, and that by God, and yet Gods Word forbids them to
preach; Ergo, that same will of God revealed does command and forbid one and
the same thing, which is absurd. Ergo, to be gifted is not to be sent to
preach. 3. You here clearly side with Arminians and So^inians, for Episcopius
Episcop. disp. 26. 4 5.
requires no more to preaching, but that the man be idoneous and apt to
teach. And Theophil. Nicolaides tract. demissiono minist. cap. 10. cap. 88.
Theoph Nocolaides, that there be in him an holy life and aptitudo ad docendum
alios, aptitude to teach others. 4. Arminians and Socinians teach that the
sending, Romans 10. 14. and other places are meant of extraordinary sending which
is now ceased, since the Apostles are dead. So (c) Episcopius Remonstr. in
confess. cap. 21. sect. 2. 4.
and Arminians in their confession. Socinus tract. de ecclesia cap. 1. page 140.
Socinus Ostorodiut Inst. cap 42. Raddecius in not. Simgle^ii page 5. ipse
textus doce^ de solis apostoli^ sermonem esse.
Ostorodius expound the place, Romans 10. 14. Paulum de suo duntaxat tempore
loqui, and so there is no need of sending now: and Robinson sympathizing with
them, says, Ordinary officers are not sent now by the Church, as the Apostles
were then sent of Christ; but the professors of Leyden Profes. Leyd. eens.
confess. cap. 2. sect. 2. 3.
refuting the Arminians, say there is a necessity of sending now as there was
then, and Calvinus Comment. in Romans 10.
Calvin, Beza ann^^. de ministerio vel ordinariovel extraordinary debet
intelligi.
Beza, Pareus de ordinaria etiam vocatione debet intelligi.
Paraeus accord to this, that Paul speaks of ordinary calling. 4. The Word of
God differenceth the giving of gifts to the ministry, and the giving of
authority, and sending authoritative by a lawful calling, the one being
collatio (...), the other (...), as Matthew. 10. 1. Then he called the twelve,
and gave them power, and v. 5. their sending and gifting by authority is
clear, these twelve he sent out: So Jer. 1. 5. I have separated thee, etc.
this is calling and sending, and v. 9. Then the Lord put forth his hand and
touched my mouth, this is a giving of gifts, and Isa. 1. 1. Isaiah is gifted
when he saw the visions of God, but Chap. 6. 7. he is sent and receives
authority to go, beside that v. 8, 9. and Job. 20. when Christ breathed upon
the Disciples, he gives them the gifts of the holy Spirit, but when he says,
Go and teach, and as my father sent me, so send I you, he gives them
authority and sends them: yea though Prophets did prophecy true things that
should come to pass, yet were they false Prophets, De^t. 13. 1, 2. because the
Lord sent them not. And for the place, Romans 10, 14. cited from Isa. 52. though
Prophets hearing Isaiah and Jeremiah prophecy of the peoples return from
Babylon, should prophecy the same that Isaiah and Jeremiah had prophesied, yet
not being sent of God, they should have been false Prophets: and after the
Spirit is entered unto Ezecbiel, chapter 2. 2. and so he is gifted, yet is there
another sending, v. 3. then said the Lord unto me, etc. And might (I pray you)
Baruch have preached all his Master Jeremiahs Prophecies? But I think that
should not have made him a Prophet: yea and Christ in whom was all fullness of
gifts and grace, Job. 1. 16. Col. 2. 9. yet took not on him to be a Priest of
the New Testament till he was called of God, as Aaron, Heb. 5. 4, 5. Job. 1.
18. and Calvin, Musculus, Gualter, expone the Prophets and Pastors, prophesying
peace, Isa. 52. to be the Prophets, who not only were gifted to preach, but
sent with special authority, to prophecy the peoples deliverance out of
Babylon. And lastly, by this also have the gifted Prophets a calling of God, to
administrate the Sacraments, because, if to be gifted, be to be sent of God,
certainly they are gifted to administrate the Sacraments no less then to
preach, and so Arminiani in Apolog. cap. 25. fol. 246.

Quid obstat cur in casu necessitatis non potest ^ fideli aliquo, infa^s aqua
ting^^ out inter ^deles cana Domini non celebrari posse^?


says the Arminians, with their Socinians, as Socinus tr^c. de eccles. page 15.
Socinus and Smalcius disp de minist. sect. 7.
Smalcius, If they say, Christ requires a particular Minister to the
Sacraments, but not so to the word: I answer, to pastoral preaching he
requires also a peculiar minister, as our brethren teach, from Act. 20. 28. 1
Pet. 5 4. 5. but to teaching by virtue of a gift any gifted man is sufficient:
the same distinction may as well hold that there is a pastoral administration
of the Sacraments and a common administration of them by virtue of a gift, yea
and Gerardus tom. 6. loco comm. de ministerio ecclesiastico. c. 3. sect. 1. n.
67. page 74.
Gerardus observes well, that to the calling of the ministry belongs the
administration of the Sacraments, as a special part thereof, 1 Cor. 12. 29.
Ephesians. 4. 11. Jam. 3. 1. 7. yea and if ministers be stewards, 1 Cor. 4. 12.
are they not dispensators of the Sacraments, by their office, as of the Word?

5. Robinson gives for shame a sort of calling to the unofficed Prophets, to
wit, that the Church requires them, if they have a word of exhortation, to
speak on, as Act. 13. But 1. not his Church, but the rulers required Paul and
Barnabas to speak. 2. The Rulers knew them to be Apostles and Pastors by
office, for there were Prophets there, Chap. 14. 1. but the Apostles would have
none to preach, as Pastors by office, but such as are proved, and authorized by
the Elders, 1 Timothy 3. 10. chapter 4. 14. 1 Timothy 5. 22. 2 Timothy 2. 2, 3. 3. This
calling of the Church is only for orders cause in the constitute Church, but a
thing not necessary by divine institution, and so the Socinians. So Smalcius
Smalcius in refut. these. Franzii par. 2. disp. 4. page 377. Non negamus ex is it
a consuctu^^ine primitivae ecclesiae Apost^licae consequii ^llud etiam nunc
fieri posse -- sed hoc est in questione, an ejusm^di constitutio sit prorsus
necessaria ad constituendum verbi dei ministerium.
teach us that the Churches sending and calling in the Apostolic Church was a
custom, (...) decorum arbitramur (says Smalcius) u^ id observaretur; and and
so says Andr. Raddecius in notis ad lib. Smiglecii page 3.
Andr. Raddecius, and the Remonst. in Apolog. cap. 21. sol. 227. missionem esse
necessariam concedimus necessitate ordinis and decori.
Arminians have also the same distinction: But this place approves not that
every by person (so to speak) might preach in the Jews Synagogues.

2. Argum. If Christ ascending on high led captivity captive, and gave gifts
unto men, some to be Apostles and some Pastors and Doctors, and that for the
gathering of Christ's body, and if some, not all are Prophets, 1 Cor. 12. 29.
then has God appointed Pastors in office to be the ordinary gatherers of
souls in to Jesus Christ, and if this be not said, when he ascended on high,
he made all private Christians de jure, preachers to edify publicly the
whole Church, and if any be not gifted, it is their own fault, for they are
obliged to be such.

3. Argum. He who Matthew. 10. 42. contradistinguisheth the prophet and the
righteous man, as different persons, and having different rewards, he does not
acknowledge a righteous man to be a Prophet, hoc ipso, because he is a
righteous man. But Christ does contradistinguish them, v. 41. He that receives
a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward, and he
that receives a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a
righteous man's reward; Ergo, Christ acknowledges them to differ. Now if a
righteous man, hoc ipso, because he is a righteous man, and a member of the
Church, should exercise these same specifice acts with a Prophet, that is, if
he should publicly preach to convert souls, he should by this place be a
Prophet, and the reward of a Prophet should be given to the receiver of the
righteous man, yea and more then the reward of a Prophet, in respect he is both
a righteous man, and a Prophet.

4. To all Prophets a special promise of Gods assistance and presence is made
in the word, as Jerem. 1. 18, 19. Matthew. 28. 20 Luke 21. Verse 14. 15. Act. 9.
Verse 17. But to these who are not prophets by office, there is no such promise
in the word; Ergo,

5. All that are sent of God as ordinary converters of souls from the kingdom
of darkness to the kingdom of Jesus Christ, must seek out fit words, as the
Preacher did, Eccles. 12. 11. 12. he must convince and judge the hearer, and
make manifest the secrets of the heart, as 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25. he must cut the
word aright, as a Timothy, 2 Timothy 2 15. he must give every one of the house
meat in due season, Matthew. 24. 46. he must know and try the ways of the
people, Jerem. 11. 18. When he sees the sword coming, he must warn the
wicked to turn from his evil way, Ezech. 3. 18, 19. He must watch for
souls, as one who is to give an account, Heb. 13. 17. He must exhort the
people to be reconciled to God, and this he must pray and request in Christ's
stead, 2 Cor. 5. 20. And he must give himself wholly to reading, 1 Timothy 4.
15, 16. And not entangle himself with any (...) calling, 2 Timothy 2. 4. All
these cannot be done by Prophets not in office. And all these are duties of
Pastors in office, and to ty private Christians, who are commanded to attend
their own callings were unreasonable, and repugnant to the Word of God. The
proposition is clear; no man can preach, but he who must give himself to
reading, and must watch and speak to the present case of the hearers; but
especially such Preachers as are the only ordinary converters of souls to
Christ, must give warning that the unrighteous die not in his sin: now to say
that all these were duties incumbent to merchants, artificers, fashioners,
carpenters, cloathiers, were to mock the word of God, and to say, these and
these only were the gatherers of a Church, and Kingdom to Christ, were
unknown Divinity.

6. All Prophets are set down in Christ's roll of lawful officers. 2. The
rules and canons for the right exercise of their ministry is set down,
especially seeing these pretended prophets are presumed to be the greatest part
of the visible Church. 3. The only ordinary gainers of souls to Christ's
kingdom and visible Church, even to the second coming of Jesus Christ. 4.
Seeing the Lord does so often complain of idle Pastors, of dumb dogs, by
whose sleeping, souls are losed. Now this Argument for the proposition seems
most reasonable. In the old Testament Priests, Levites, Prophets; and all the
edifying officers are set down there, and so are the officers and canons anent
their government set down in the New Testament, Ephesians. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 12. 28. 1 Timothy 3. 2 Timothy 2. Act. 2. 17, 18. Io^l 2. 28. Act. 20. 28. But no such things
are written in the old or new Testament of gifted Prophets not in office.

7. All lawful officers have power authoritatively from Jesus Christ to remit
and to retain sins, by the preaching of the Word. But Preachers out of
office have no such power, Ergo, Preachers out of office, are not lawful
Preachers.

The proposition is, Ioh. 20. 21. The assumption is evident, for where are they
sent as the Father sent his Son Christ? and that promise is made only to the
Apostles, and to their successors, Prophets without office are not the
successors of the Apostles.

Robinson Peoples plea, Arg. 1. page 2, 3.
Robinson says, the commission there given is peculiar to the Apostles only,
and confirmed by the miraculous inbreathing of the holy Ghost, and by them to
be dispensed principally to unbeleevers, of all which nothing is common to
ordinary officers, but else where, this power is given to the whole Church,
Matthew. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 2 Cor. 6. 6. Yea to every faithful brother, Matthew.
16. 18. Chapter 18. 15. Luke 17. 3. This is that which Anabaptists teaches (as
Chemnitius loc. com. part. 3. cap. de Eccles. page 314.
Chemnitius says) and the very doctrine of Ostorodius in Instit. cap. 42. page
438.
Ostorodius, Nicolaides in defens. tract. Socini de ecclesia and ministerio,
cap. 1. page 146.
Nicolaides, Socinus tract. de eccles page 14.
Socinus, but except the miraculous inbreathing of the holy Ghost, there is
nothing here peculiar to the Apostles only: for the loosing and retaining of
sin, is nothing but binding and loosing of the sins, and this is nothing
but the forgiving and retaining of sin by the preaching of the word, and
censures of the Church, and that binding and loosing, Matthew. 16. is not given
to the whole Church of believers, for the Text says no such thing, but power
of the keys is given to Peter, that is, to the Churchguides the successors of
Peter. 2. Authoritative power of forgiving of sin, is not Matthew. 18. said to
be ratified in heaven, but only when the Church does bind and loose; and
forgiving, Luke 17. is betwixt sister and sister, who have not power to bind
and loose in heaven.

8. All Prophets are either ordinary or extraordinary, as is clear in Gods
Word; extraordinary now are not in the Church, and the ordinary Prophets now
are not gifted to preach the Word, except as Timothy, from their youth they
have been trained up in the Scriptures, and have learning, sciences, knowledge
of the tongues, if he would be a man able to teach others, 2 Timothy 2. 3. 1 Timothy
3. he must meditate, read, and give himself wholly to these things, 1 Timothy
3. 15, 16. and so must leave his calling contrary to the Apostle his
commandment, 1 Cor. 7. 20, 21, 22. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 11. Ephesians. 4. 28. but if he
have a gift for public preaching, he is to separate himself for it, seeing a
gift is a token of Gods separation.

Quest. III. Whether the Arguments of Mr. Robinson for the p^ophecying Peoples
plea for prophesying, page 34.
of private persons, not in office, do strongly conclude?

I shall set them down in order and discuss them. If a Bishop must be apt to
teach, then he must be tried before he be^ admitted to the office. Ergo, while
be is o^t of office he must prophecy.

Answ. This Argument concludes not the Question, for by as good reason the
sons of the Prophets or young Prophets, who behoved to exercise their gift,
as 1 Samuel 10. 5. 2 King. 2. 7. 2 King. 4. 1. 1 King. 20. 35. before they be
fully received as Prophets, must be prophets and officers not in office
differing from Prophets in office, even as their lay Prophets are different
from Pastors, but an apprentise of a trade is not a different tradesman from
the master to whom he serves as apprentise, but he is only different from him
in degree. But their Lay-Prophets are tradesmen, not sons of the Prophets,
not aiming at the pastoral charge, but ordinary officers for converting of
souls, and do differ from Pastors, as those who are non-Pastors, differ from
Pastors.

Robinson. If the Lords gifting of Eldad and Medad, Numb. 11. 29. with the
spirit of prophesying, inabling them to prophecy, and made them extraordinary
Prophets, why should not by due proportion an ordinary gift inabling a man to
an ordinary prophecy, serve also to make him an ordinary Prophet? Now Moses in
wishing that all the people were Prophets, wishes as well the use, as
possession of the gift.

Answ. The Jews say that Eldad and Medad were of the 70. Elders, upon whom was
powered part of that spirit of prophecy, that was on Moses, and they say they
were written in the 70. papers, but not elected, because they drew the papers
(...) a part and not (...) Senex, but it is not like Joshu^ would have envied
if they had been now Judges, or that Moses would have likened them unto the
people. However, prophets they were. But both the Antecedent is false, and the
consequence nulle, for if you mean by the Lords gifting of Eldad and Medad, a
naked and a bare revealing to them of the visions of God, without an impulsive
commandment from God, setting them on action to prophecy, (this impulsion is
an authoritative sending and calling,) the antecedent is false, for that
gifting of them only made them able, but not formally authorized Prophets: but
if the gifting of them did include both the gift and the command of God, to use
the gift, as certainly it did, now the consequence is null, for the naked
giving of an ordinary gift, except God by himself, and now by the authority of
his Church, command the use of the gift, no gifted man, because gifted, is by
and by a Prophet, but he must have a commandment ecclesiasticke now to preach,
as Eldad and Medad had impulsive commandment to prophecy; and if any be gifted
by an ordinary way as Eldad and Medad was extraordinarily, then they are to be
thrusted out to the pastoral calling, and none but a fleshly man will envy
them.

Robinson, 2 Chronicles. 17. 7. Jehos^aphat sent his Princes to preach or teach in
the cities of Judah, and with them the Levites, so the 70. Interpreters, so
Pagnine, so Ierom, and the English translation: Ergo, Princes are Prophets not
in office, who may teach.

Answ. 1. Doctor Alexander Colveill my reverent colleague, and as learned, so
well experienced in the Hebrew, says that (...) is here taken for (...) and

read; And he sent the Princes, as Buxtorfius notes, Thesaur. l. 1. e. 12. and
this Chaldaisme is to be seen in these books of the Chronicles written after
the Captivity, as 2 Chronicles. 5. 13. (...) that they might praise Jehovah, and
Chap. 32. 17. (...) he writ letters also, to rail on the Lord, and so the
parallel place, 2 King. 19. 4. (...) and the place, as the Doctor cites, is
well exponed by R. Solomon Iarc^i in his Commentary (...) that is, it was
proper to the Priests and Levites (...) to teach and instruct, as it is
written, Deuteronomy. 24. 28. according to all that the Priests and Levites shall teach

Elisha shall cure him. Pilat scourged Jesus, but Livius says, the Judge said
to a burrio, i. Lictor, colliga manus: so Deuteronomy. 31. 22. Moses therefore writ
this song the same day, and taught it, v. 19. (...) teach them this song, and
put it in their mouth. It was impossible that Moses in his own person, could
teach the people, and put this song in their mouth, therefore he behooved to
teach them by the Priests and Levites, as 24. 25.

2. The Hebrews may read so, but he sent to his princes, for the letter (...)
is a note of the accusative case, of the dative, of the genitive, or of the
accusative case with a certain motion as (...) to David, or of David. Valet
Haebraeis (inquit Schindlerus) ad, in, vel (...) super, and it notes a motion
to a thing, Genesis 2. 22. and aedificavit, he made the rib in a woman (...) Iud.
8. 27. and Gideon made it in an Ephod (...) 2 Samuel 4. They anointed David
(...) to be King. Then it must be read, he sent to the Princes, Benchail,
etc. to teach in the Cities of Judah, v. 8. and with them he sent Levites, v.
9. and they taught in Judah: there is not the least signification in the Text
that the Princes taught.

Robinson. Princes and Judges are to open and expone the Law by which they
govern, else they govern with tyranny.

Answ. Judges are to convince the thief and the murderer, 1. In a coactive
way, not in an ecclesiastic way. 2. As these sins are troublesonie and
hurtful to the State and Commonwealth. 3 That others may fear to hurt the
State by the like sins, not that the malefactors may be converted to God, and
their souls may be saved; but your lay-Prophets simpliciter, not in ordine ad
paenam, are the only ordinary converters of souls.

Robinson. There is an excellent Sermon (says he) of Iel oshaphats to the
Judges, 2 Chronicles. 19. 6. and to the Levites, 9. 10. and a divine prayer, 8. 20.
and Hezekiah has an excellent Sermon to the Priests and Levites, in the very
Temple, 2 Chronicles. 29. 4, 5. And Nehemiah taught the people the Law of the Lord:
Kings are Shepherds and feeders, not only by government, but also by
instruction.

Answ. 1. These Sermons of Iehoshaphat and Hezekiah were first in time of
extraordinary defections, when the Priests (whose it were to teach the people)
were corrupted and turned dumb dogs.

2. They were Sermons of Prophetical instinct and divine impulsions, as the
very style of them clears, and therefore cannot warrant Christian Princes to
be ordinary Prophets, except you make the King a national Pastor over
Pastors, and two thousand Congregations; for if, as Prince, he be their
Pastor, he is equally Pastor and teacher to all these Congregations, and he
must be as Prince, obliged to be a Prophet to convert all: How exclude they a
Pastor of Pastors and a diocesian prelate, who introduce a national Pastor?
Yea how deny we a Pope, if the King carry both the swords, both of the spirit
as a Prophet, and that ordinarily, by his calling to feed souls, and the
civil sword to take vengeance upon evil doers? for whosoever preaches the
word of God as a Prophet, has the keys of the Kingdom of heaven committed
unto him, to bind and loose, to remit and retain sins on earth, and in
heaven, for the preached Gospel is the keys of the kingdom, as is the power
of Church censures. Then must the Kings have both keys of Church and State,
and what hinders but they admit the King as King, and a national Pastor, to
be the head of the Church under Christ. 3. Consider the King as a Christian and
gifted with learning, he is parens patriae, and public nurse father of the
Church, and may occasionally upon some extraordinary exigent, at the meeting of
the States, or when his armies are going out to battle, make use of the Word
of God, to exhort them to general duties of Religion, and Justice, and to be
prepared for meeting with eternity and judgment; and this he does as a
Christian father, his subjects being his children: but what is this to infer
that the King as King is a Prophet, and an ordinary feeder of souls ex
officio, by office, and that by knowledge and instruction, as Robinson says,
and an ordinary converter of souls, and such a Prophet as does preach in the
Church ordinarily, to the edifying of the Church, and conviction and conversion
of Infidels, and gathering of a people to God, as they say of their Prophets
out of office, 1 Cor. 14. 4, 5. 12. 23, 24, 25. 31. And upon the same ground a
King who has the spirit of adoption, may publicly pray, as Jeboshaphat did
for the Lord of hosts his presence, to go out with his Armies against the
enemies of the Gospel, but a speciei positione ad generis positionem male
sequitur, he may be the peoples mouth to God in such an exigence, and he may
give a word of exhortation anent duties general of good subjects; Ergo, he is
an ordinary Prophet, for the ordinary preaching of the Gospel to all his
Subjects; it is a loose and vain collection.

Lastly, Nehemiah a Prince taught the people, says he.

I answer, Nehemiah was a Prophet and Author of Canonick Scripture, as was
Solomon, and therefore his teaching proves not the point, Nehem. 1. v. 1. Nor
can I find where Nebemiah preached or prophesied to the people at all, but
that Ezra the Scribe, Nehem. 8. and the Levites, Chap. 8. (...) 9. (which
Robinson cites without warrant) did instruct and ^each the people.

Robinson. And if it were not (says he) the received order in Page 38, 39.
Israel of old for men out of office to speak and teach in public, how did
Scribes, Pharisees and Lawyers teach publicly among the Jews, of whom yet
many were not Levites, or Churchmen, but indifferently of any tribe? Phil. 3.
5. and how was Jesus admitted to dispute in the Temple with the Doctors, Luke
2. 46. and to preach in the Synagogues, Matthew. 9. 35. Luke 4. 16, 17. and how
were Paul and Barnabas desired, if they had any word of exhortation, to say on?
Act. 13. 14. 15. For the rulers acknowledged Christ and Paul for no
extraordinary Praphets, but only admitted them to the use of their gifts.

Answ. 1. It is great ignorance, if you think Scribes, Pharisees and
expounders of the Law were not Prophets, because they were not of the Tribe of
Levi, for Priests behooved only to be of the Tribe of Levi, but Prophets, as
Jeremiah and others, were extraordinarily raised up of God out of any tribe, as
Calvin well observes, and all versed in Scripture, and that they were teachers
in office is clear, Matthew. 23. 2. They Calvin praelect. in Ierem. 1. 1.
sit in Moses his chair, v. 13. 14. etc. and the office of teaching, though
abused, is also ascribed by Christ, to the expounders of the Law, Luke 11. 46.
and what is said of Pharisees in taking away the key of knowledge, is said of
them, v. 52.

2. Christ's asking of questions, and that when he was 12. years of age, all
wondering at his learning, Luke 2. 42. was no act of prophesying: and granting
it had been the practice of the Jewish Church to admit a child of twelve
years to preach in the Temple, and to admit hand over head, tradesmen, and all
to prophecy in the Temple, it is an Argument from their corrupt practice, a
facto ad jus, and no more a rule for the preaching of fashioners, cloathiers,
mariners, in the Temple, then the Jews their taking up stones in the Temple to
stone Christ: and it is known that Christ did not publicly prophecy in the
Synagogues till he was baptized (as all the learned think) and while his name
and fame spread abroad, that a great Prophet was arisen, Luke 3. 21, 22, 23.
Luke 4. 14, 15, 16. Yea and the Pharisees knew him to be a teacher sent of God,
Ioh. 3. 2. And all the people took him to be a Prophet, and therefore the
rulers feared to apprehend him, and his doctrine and miracles got him the name
of a Prophet sent of God, and Paul and Barnabas were known to be teachers in
office, else the rulers would not have desired a word of exhortation, for they
did not invite strangers promiscuously to prophecy, and this you only say,
but do not prove, and is more for us nor against us.

Robinson alleges a place out of Jeremiah, 50. 3. 4. where it Page 39.
is said, That Israel and Judah in a spiritual conference shall encourage ^^^
another (as Calvin says) to repentance, and to join themselves to the true
Church; which is nothing for public prophesying, for thus much private
Christians, yea all that fear God, women not excepted, may do in Christian
conference, as is clear, Zach. 8. 21. Mal. 3. 16. Psalm. 42. 4. Esa. 2. 1, 2,
3. Heb. 3. 13. Heb. 10. 23, 24, 25.

The fourth place which he brings is, Matthew. 10. v. 1. ^. 6. Christ sent out
the twelve Disciples to preach the Kingdom of Robinson, page 39 40.
^eaven to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, but they were not Apostles
or Preachers in office, till his resurrection, but only Apostles elect as you
say, the major elect; For 1. they received not commission till after Christ's
resurrection, Ioh. 20. 22. 23. Matthew. 28. 19, 20. 2. The least in the kingdom
of God is greater then John Baptist, for the Christian Church began not
properly till his resurrection, and the Apostles being members of the Church of
the New Testament, they could not be Apostles in office, before Christ's death,
except an adjunct be before the subject, and an officer before the
incorporation, whereof he is an officer. 3. They were ignorant of many
mysteries of Christ, his death, resurrection, nature of his Kingdom, Matthew.
20. etc. which was unbeseeming Apostolic dignity, to the which the highest
degree if infallible revelation was requisite. 4. How did they return, as
non-residents to remain with Christ till his death? 5. Ephesians. 4. 11. Christ
till he ascended on high, and not till then, gave some to be Apostles, etc.
Hence it must follow that the Disciples were Prophets not in office, and so did
preach all this time.

Answer.

1. I answer these frivolous reasons. 2. I prove they were Apostles, or at
least Prophets in office, before Christ's death and resurrection.

And 1. They received not ample and largest commission to go and preach to all
nations, before Christ's resurrection, Matthew. 28. 19. that is true, but what
then? Therefore they received no commission as Pastors in office to preach to
Israel, not to the Gentiles or Samaritans, it no ways follows; yea the
contrary, a calling to a Pastoral charge they had, Matthew. 10. 5. These twelve
did Jesus send out, and commanded them saying, Go, etc. And these directions
and canons which concern watchmen, 1 Timothy 3. are fully set down, Matthew. 10.
when they receive both gifts, v. 1. and authority and a calling, v. 5. and
special instructions, v. 7, 8, 9, 10. how they should discharge and acquit
themselves in their ministry, the like whereof is never given to lay-Prophets
(I must crave leave to use this word.) To the 2. I answer, That it is false
that Christ died and lived a member of the Jewish Church only, he received the
Sacrament of baptism as a member of the Christian Church, as he was
circumcised and kept the Law of Moses, to testify he was a member of Jewish
Church; and it became him to be a member of both Churches, who was to make of
two one people, Ephesians. 2. 15. And it is false that the Apostles were adjuncts
of the Christian Church; as Apostles invested in their full Apostolic dignity,
to preach to all the world, they were parts and members, not adjuncts of the
Catholic visible Church of Christians: when Pastors are called adjuncts of the
visible Church, it is clear that they are made but accidents of the visible
Church, and so that the Ministry is not simply necessary to the visible
Church, which is the wicked doctrine of Remonst. in confess. cap. 22. sect. 1.

page 118.
and the Anabaptists taught the same, as says Gastius de cata-Baptistarum
erroribus lib. 1. page 35.
Gasti^s, But though the Apostles, as invested with full Apostolic authority,
be members of the Christian Church, and the New Jerusalem be founded upon
their doctrine, Ephesians. 2. 20. Revel. 21. 14. yet this hinders not, but as
called Apostles and officers, limited to preach to losed Israel only, Matthew.
10. 5, 6, 7. they were members of the Jewish Church, and called Apostles. To
the 3. I answer, ignorance of fundamental points not fully proposed and
revealed, if there be a gracious disposition of saving faith, to believe these
when they shall be revealed, such was as in the Lords Disciples, Matthew. 16. 16,
17. Luke 12. 32. Luke 22. 28, 29. may well stand with the dignity of young,
and as yet limited Apostles, Matthew. 10. 5, 6, 7. who had not yet received the
holy Ghost, in that measure, Act. 1. 8, 9. that was requisite for Apostles, in
their full Apostolic charge, and made infallible penmen of Canonick
Scriptures, sent to preach to all the world. To the 4. I answer, They were not
non-residents, because they returned to reside with Christ after they had
casten out devils, Ioh. 4. 1, 2. (which your lay-Prophets by your own
confession cannot lawfully do) not to be idle, but to learn more, and to be
eye and care witnesses of the doctrine, life, death, resurrection and ascension
to glory of Christ, It is a vain thing to say that teachers of all Israel,
remaining in Israel were nonresidents, that is, Pastors not attending their
charge.
2 Pet. 1. 16, 17, 18. 1 John 1. 1, 2, 3. Matthew. 26. 37, 38, 39. Luke 24. 50,
51, 52. Joh. 20. 19, 20. Act. 4. 20. which was necessary, that they might
preach these things to the world. Nor is a Pastor in his study attending,
reading, as 1 Timothy 3. 15, 16. though he be not, then teaching, a non-resident.
To the 5. I say, when Christ ascended unto heaven, Ephesians. 4. 11. He gave some
to be Apostles, etc. but that gifting of Apostles is not to restrict the
institution of Apostles, to the precise time of his ascension: for you grant
that after the Lords resurrection, and before his ascension they were ordained
Apostles, Matthew. 28. 19. Joh. 20. 23. but the full sending of the holy Spirit
to Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers, is ascribed to his ascension as
a special fruit of his ascension, Act. 1. 8, 9. Joh. 16. v. 7, 8, 9. and
therefore is their sending called an effect of the holy Spirit. For the second
point, Giving and not granting that the Apostles were not Apostles, till after
the resurrection, yet will it not follow, that they were lay-Prophets, or
Prophets out of office, for they might have been Pastors in office, though not
Apostles in office, for there were beside these, others in the Jewish Church,
else where were Scribes, Pharisees, Lawyers, Doctors, all sitters in Moses his
chair? They were not Apostles sure; what were they then? all teachers out of
office? No; If then I prove that the Apostles were teachers in office, though
it were granted that they were not Apostles (as in the fullness and plenitude
thereof they were not) till Christ arose from the dead, I prove as much as
takes this argument for lay-prophets out of their hands. But that they were
not nonofficed teachers, but called Apostles or Pastors, I prove.

1. Argum. Judas was chosen one of the twelve and an Apostle, Ergo, far more
were the rest. I prove the Antecedent, 1. Act. 20. Let another take his (...),
his charge, 2. v. 17. He took part with us (say they) in this (...), in this
ministry. 3. Matthias v. 25. was chosen in that place and Apostleship from
which Judas fell. Now Lay-Prophets have no official Episcopacie, no Ministry,
nor can any chosen in their place said to be chosen to an Apostleship, Ioh. 6.
7. Have not I chosen you twelve? this choosing was to an Embassage; says
Cyrill, Augustine, Euthymius, and all our Divines with them.

2. Matthew. 10. 2. These are the names of the twelve Apostles* v. 5. he send
them, What power he gives to them in respect of all the world to remit and
retain sins, Job. 20. that he gives to them toward the house of Israel, v.
11, 12, 13. under the name of offered peace, (Magis and minus non variant
speciem) Mark. 13. 14. Mark. 3. 14. he ordained twelve, (...), he made twelve
to be with him, which he might send to preach, Luke 9. 1. and he called the
twelve, and (...), be sent them, he took them from their fishing, and made
them fishers of men; and Matthew. 10. 10. he calls them workmen worthy of
their hire: private Prophets are not gifted, nor sent, nor taken from their
callings, nor are they workmen deserving stipend, for that is due to Prophets
by office, 1 Cor. 9. 13. 14. Gal. 6. 6. 1 Timothy 5. 17.

3. Those who have power to dispense the seals of grace, and to baptize, are
not private or unofficed Prophets, but sent of God and in office, as Matthew. 28.
19. 1 Cor. 1. 17. and Iustific. page
Robinson grants this, and so do Separatists teach Confess. of Separatists,
Art. 21.
. But the Disciples of Christ, before his resurrection, baptized, Ioh. 4. 2.

4. Those who were witnesses of the life, miracles, doctrine of Christ, and
preached the same, and confirmed it by miracles, were pastors.

5. Those who were twelve selected men chosen, Luke 6. 13. named Apostles,
Mark. 9. 35. Mark. 10. 32. Luke 8. 1. to whom the keys of the kingdom were
given, Matthew. 18. 17, 18, 19. Matthew. 16. 19. are not unofficed men.

6. This is a Popish opinion, and to be suspected, for Papists to advance Peter
to a Popedom, will have him no Apostle, while after the resurrection, for
Bellarmin. desacr. ord. lib. 1. cap. 9.
Bellarmine says, Imposition of hands is essential to holy orders, and that
the Apostle ordained no Presbyters while Christ was risen, and made the
Apostles and gave them the holy Spirit: Council. Trident. Sess. 23. cap. 4.
The Council of Trent hinteth at the same opinion; Bellarmine says the
Apostles were made Priests, at the last Supper, to sacrifice Christ's body, but
not Presbyters till after that, when they received the holy Ghost; and Hosius
in confess. Polonica tit. 50.

Peoples plea, page 42, 43.
Robinson cites Luke 8. 39. Christ bids the dispossessed man g^shew what
great things the Lord had done for him, and he went and preached it; now
miracles are a part of the Gospel, and written that we should believe, Joh. 20.
30. and they prove that Jesus is the Son of God. Ergo, This man being no
Prophet, preached the Gospel.

Answ. 1. This will not conclude the Question. 1. One man published one single
miracle wrought upon himself, which is a part of the Gospel only. 2. And upon
a particular occasion did show what things the Lord had done for him. 3. He is
commanded to publish it to his friends, and domestics only, Matthew. 5. 19. Go
to thy house, (...) to thine own friends, and show them what the Lord has
done for thee. Hence from this narrow antecedent a vaste and broad conclusion
is drawn; Ergo, it is lawful, because this man published one particular of
the Gospel, for any gifted man to preach the whole Gospel, because one man did
it upon a miraculous occasion to his friends; Ergo, all gifted men may
prophecy the whole Gospel to all the Churches ordinarily, it is a vain
consequence. 2. Because he published one particular, upon a particular
exigence, therefore any gifted man may ordinarily, and weekly and daily Preach
for the conversion of souls. 3. Because he published one miracle to his
friends in a private way, therefore any gifted man may preach the whole Gospel
in public, to all the Church, truly here is a weak reason.

2. It is most like that this man was an intruding Prophet, like the
Separatists Prophets, for he requested that he might be with Jesus, and be
made a Disciple to preach the Gospel, as Calvin, Marlorat, Bullinger expone
it; but Jesus suffered him not. Now if Christ had commanded him to be a
Prophet, as Robinson will have him, he should have granted what he sought.

Lastly, the man did more then Christ commanded, for Mark. 9. 20. He published
it in Decapolis throughout all the city, whereas Christ had limited the
publishing thereof to his friends and house only.

Robinson says, Luke 10. The Seventie Disciples preached, and yet Page 44.
they were men out of office.

I answer. 1. The Seventie Disciples were Pastors in office. 1. Satan by their
ministry fell from heaven as lightning, v. 19. Christ says, Behold I give you
power to tread upon serpents, Luke 10. 1. After these things the Lord apponted
other Seventie, and sent them out; here is a clear calling, they confirm
their doctrine by miracles, and casting out of devils, as the twelve Apostles.
2. Christ sent out, (...), also other Seventie, Ergo, as he gave a calling to
the Twelve, so he did to these Seventie, and the same pa^^orall commission is
given to them. Behold, I send you etc. Luke 10. 3, 4, 5, 6.

3. The Seventie are called workmen, sent out to the Lords harvest, Luke 10. 2.
and the same is said of Shepherds in office, Matthew. 8. 36, 37, 38. to whom
wages are due, as to Pastors in Office, 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14. Gal. 6. 6. 1 Timothy 5.
17.

3. It is said by Christ of these Seventie, He that hears you hears me, he
that despises you despises me. Ergo, they were Ambassadors in Christ's stead,
as Pastors in office are, 2 Cor. 5. 20.

The Samaritane woman (says Robinson) Job. 4. 28. Preached, Page 44, 45, 46.
and many of the Samaritans believed because of her, v. 39. and without
preaching of the word of God, none can believe, Romans 10. 14, 15. If a woman may
teach without the Church, then may a man teach in the Church.

Answ. 1. A woman may teach. 2. In a non-constituted Church, where there is no
salvation, and they worship they know not what, Joh. 4. 22. 3. A woman may
occasionally declare one point of the Gospel, that Mary's Son is Christ; but
hence it follows not, Therefore, 1 a man, 2 in a constituted Church, 3 may
ordinarily preach the whole Gospel to the Church in public: a weak sparre
for so vast a roof.

2. He abuses the place, Romans 10. 14. and would hence prove that a woman or
any gifted teacher, is a sent Preacher by whom faith ordinarily comes; for
otherwise who dare deny but faith comes by reading? and just as the
Catechize of Raecovia exponeth the place, Romans 10. 14. to evert the necessity
of a sent ministry, so does Robinson expone the place.

Robinson, Act. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. Act. 11. 20, 21. All the Churches Page 46, 47,
48, 49.
were scattered abroad, except the Apostles, and those who were scattered,
preached every where the Gospel, Ergo, Disciples out of office may lawfully
preach the Gospel.

Answ. Whether these of the scattered Church, who preached, were the Seventie
Disciples, as learned Divines think, I dispute not; But that they were
Prophets out of office, the Text says not. But that they were extraordinarily
gifted Prophets who preached, I conceive the text does insinuate, for it is
said, Act. 11. 21. The hand of the Lord was with them, the very word which is,
Ezekiel. 3. 14. The hand of the Lord was strong with me.

2. In a scattered and dissolved Church, gifted persons may prophecy, Ergo, in
a constituted Church gifted persons are the ordinary and only Ministers of
conversion, though they be never called to the office, it does no ways follow.

Robinson says, it is not reasonable to think that they were all extraordinary
Prophets, and that if they were immediately inspired, there had been no need
of so speedy sending of Barnabas from Jerusalem to Antioch with supply, though
he were a man full of the holy Ghost, for ^^ were such Prophets as well as ^ee,
Ephesians. 2. 20. and 3. 5.

Answ. We do not affirm, that all and every one of the Church, even women
and children were extraordinarily gifted, but whether their gift was ordinary
or extraordinary, the Text does not say that they were Prophets out of office,
and the Law of disputing says, Affirmanti incumbit probatio; the hand of God
was with them, as it uses to be with Prophets.

2. They traveled as far as Phenice, Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word
of the Lord, this is that which the Apostolic planters of Churches did, as
Master builders, laying the foundation Calvin Com. in Act. 11 21.
of Churches, and Calvin calls them Ministers, planters of the Gospel. Nor is
it like that Prophets not in office, would so travel and preach the Gospel to
the Gentile ^s and Calvin says, singulari Dei impulsu hoc factum, and that
many were turned unto the Lord. 2. Barnabas saw the grace of God in them. 3.
And exhorted them that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord,
Ergo, there was grace and a profession visible of cleaving to the Lord, before
Barnabas came, and so a founded Church; and if it had been done by gifted
Christians of ordinary gifts, and wanting the spirit of Prophecy, the work had
been the more illustrious, and it would not have been concealed, yea and help
in so great an harvest by Barnabas an Apostolic man, was very needful, the
number being so great of those who were converted to the faith, seeing the
great Apostles sought help, and Paul took Titus and Timothy with him often,
for helping the work of the Lord.

The next Scripture (says Robinson) is 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11. As every man has
received the gift, so let him minister as good stewards of Page 49.
the manifold graces of God; if any man speak, let him speak as the oracles
of God.

Answ. This says with us, for private Christians are not stewards; who gave
them the keys? Yea 1 Cor. 4. 1. it is a word of office, and it is not given to
Ministers not in office, as Beza observes well; he sets down one general,
that the Ministers be ready to distribute, and then two species. 1 Preaching
Ministers, that they speak the Oracles of God. 2. Serving Ministers, Elders
and Deacons, that they minister out of the ability that God gives them; and
the place is against private Prophets.

Robinson alleges, Revel. 11. 3. I will give power to my two witnesses, and
they shall prophecy a thousand two hundredth and sixty days, clothed in
sackcloth. The Clergy men are not only witnesses against the Antichrist. In
the Antichrists reign, no Church officer, a^ an^ officer, witnesses against
him, but all for him, as both having their authority from him, and binding
themselves to submit their doctrine to his censure. The persons indeed that
were officers, even Mass Priests, Monks, and Friars, witnessed some of them
against him, but so did not their office, something was extraordinary, I
acknowledge, in respect of the then prevailing order, and in respect of their
degree of gifts and graces, but no extraordinary and miraculous gift of
prophesying: and Brightman exponeth the two witnesses to be the holy
Scriptures and assemblies of the faithful.

Answ. The two witnesses (says Iunius annot. in locum Apocalypse.
Junius) are the Ministers, for number, few, and for place, contemptible, so
says Couper; Cooper on Revel. 10.
and Pareus comment in Apocalypse. cap. 10.
Paraeus induces many paires of witnesses, as in Bohemia, John Hus, and Jerome
of Prague, An. 1415, 1416. in Saxony, Luther and Melancthon; in Argentine
Bucer and Cariton; in Helvetia, Zwinglius and Oecolampadius; in France, Farell,
and Calvin, and these were Pastors in office. We need not stand upon the number
of two, but because two is the least and fewest number, the witnesses were two.
But first there is no reason to fetter and restrict the Text, to witnesses and
Martyrs out of office, excluding the Ministers and Prophets in office, and to
infer thence that gifted persons in a constitute Church are the ordinary
Ministers of conversion. 1. These two witnesses did prophecy in the midst of
Popish Babylon, where God had no visible Church. They did upon a particular
exigence, being called thereunto as the Martyrs of Christ, to give a witness
for Christ against Antichrist, and they sealed the truth with their blood: but
the consequence is null, a Martyr at the stake, though no Pastor, may give a
confession of his faith, to the persecutors, as Stephen did. Therefore a gifted
person not in office, may ordinarily preach in the Church. I would not buy such
logic with a rotten nut. 3. Many women were witnesses and Martyrs, and gave a
testimony against Antichrist; Ergo women may preach in the Church: what vanity
is this?

2. Also if those witnesses had an extraordinary measure of gifts and graces to
bear witness to the truth, it follows not; Ergo, Christians gifted with an
ordinary measure of the Spirit are ordinary Prophets for the conversion of
souls.

2. Though these witnesses were only unofficed Prophets, yet the prophesying
ascribed to them, after they arose from the dead, will not infer that
unofficed Prophets are ordinarily to preach, for the rising again of slain
Prophets is not to be exponed of the raising again of the persons of unofficed
Prophets to preach, but it is to be exponed of the rising again of the buried
Gospel; which in the ministry of faithful Pastors and in other new Martyrs,
Pastors and others arose again from the dead, with the Spirit and power of
these Martyrs, and that buried truth, that was in former times persecuted by
Antichrist did now revive again to the wondering of Babylon; for the intent of
the Spirit is to show that the Gospel, and true Church, slain and buried,
shall arise again within a short time, as three days and a half.

4. It is vain that he says none of the Clergy witnessed and prophesied
against Antichrist; he is not versed in the Churches history who teaches so,
for Monks and Friars were Ministers, (though their office unlawful) and as
Ministers of Christ. Luther, Melancthon, and thousands other gave testimony
against Antichrist.

Robinson adds, Revel. 14. 6. Where an Angel flies in the midst Page 52, 53.
of heaven, that is, in the visible Church, having the everlasting Gospel to
preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kindred. That
is, God raised men in the midst of popery, not miraculously inspired (for you
can show me no such) who preached the Gospel, not by virtue of an office; The
office of a Friar, Monk, or Mass^-Priest, is no ministry of Christ's
appointment; and when they gave their clearest testimony, they were almost all
excluded out of Rome, and so in respect of their personal gifts and graces,
they were Angels of God, in respect of their office, they were Angels of
Antichrist.

Answ. 1. There is no reason to reject the interpretation of Iunius annot. in
cap. 14.
Junius, that this Angel was a type of the servants of God, who opposed Popery
after the times of Bonifacius the eight, as Cassiodorus the Italian, Arnoldus
de villa nova, Occam, Dantes, Petrarcha, Ioann^s de Rupe the Franciscan,
Wickliff; And Pareus Paraeus in locum.
refers the type to Wickliffe, Marsilius Patavinus, Petrarcha; Our country man
Napper Comment. on the Revel. chapter 14.
Napper exponeth it of Luther, Melancthon, and Calvin in the seventh age, Anno
1541, and it is false that they were all excommunicated, and though the
accident of their office, to be a Monk, a Friar, was Antichristian, yet the
ministry it self was of Christ, and by it they did preach against Antichrist,
as they did validely baptize, for I hope they did not baptize as unofficed
Prophets. Lastly, this Angel did not preach in the visible Church, but in the
midst of Popery, and therefore does not prove it is lawful in a true visible
constituted Church, for gifted Prophets out of office, to be ordinary
Preachers.

Robinson much urges the place, 1 Cor. 14. 1 Because the Apostle speaks of
the manifestation of the gifts and graces common to all, Par. 54. 55.
as well brethren as ministers, ordinary as extraordinary. 2. He speaks of
the fruits common to all, edification, exhortation, and comfort, compared with,
1 Thessalonians. 5. 11. 14. and of that which at all times remains amongst the
Christians, to wit, love.

Answ. The cohesion of this Chapter with the former is clear, charity should
be followed, because so excellent. Therefore cover gifts, which are most
conducing to love and edification, and that is to prophecy; he proves
excellency of prophesying above others, and teaches in this Chapter the right
ordering of public Church meeting.

Now Robinsons Argument is this, if it stand good, As many as may love one
another, and may edify, exhort and comfort one another, may express their
love by public prophesying, for edification in love: but all Christians, even
such as are not in Church State, nor officers, are to love one another, to
edify, exhort and comfort one another. Ergo.

The proposition is most false; women are obliged to love one another, and to
exhort and edify one another, Prove. 31. 26. Til. 2. 3. yet can they not
prophecy in the Church, 1 Cor. 14. 34, 35. yea excommunicated persons are not
loosed from the duties of love and mutual rebuking in private, if they may be
exhorted as brethren, 1 Thessalonians. 3. 15. They may exhort and rebuke others, Levit.
19. 17. which the law of nature requires, yea Peter as a Pastor out of love to
Christ is to preach, Ioh. 21. 15. 16, 17. But therefore private Christians are
not obliged to Pastoral preaching, and administration of the Seals, which are
expressions of the love of Christ, yet to administer Sacraments is an act of
edification, is therefore every act of edification and love common to all,
because to love, and in some private way, to edify all, is incumbent as a
duty to all? nay a King out of love of Christ, should govern Gods people, a
Captain fight Gods battles, a Sea man sail, and a Professor teach in the
Schools; will it follow, because to love one another is common, that all
private men may be Kings, may kill men in battle, and that the Plowman should
sail and invade the Mariners calling? this were Anabaptisticall confusion of
places and callings, and should evert states, places, charges and callings, and
overturne Church and State, and make the Church an old Chaos; the God of order
has not so ordered callings and places. But (says the man) if the end, which
is edification and comfort, continues, therefore the gift of prophesying
continues.

Answ. 1. Prophesying continues, who takes it out of the world? It continues
in such, as God has set in the Church for that end and use, 1 Cor. 12. 29. but
not in all, and every Plowman, who in his place is obliged to edify.

2. The Argument is also weak, that continues, the end whereof continues,
forso circumcision, passover, sacrificing, the end of all which was edifying,
should continue in the Church: Mr. Yates answered to him, extraordinary gifts,
as strange tongues, miracles, are for edification, yet they continue not. Mr.
Robinson answers to him, strange tongues and the office of the Ministry do
not properly edify, but the use of strange tongues.

I answer, there does much weakness here appear, love in Mr. Robinsons breast
does not edify, nor his habit of prophesying, but the acts of expressions of
love, and the use of prophesying, edifieth, and for that cause we may well say
that the office does edify

There being (says Robinson) no other means to edify, exhort, and Page 97.
comfort, left in the Church, but propbecying, Paul argues from the common
grace of love, as well upon brethren as officers, to ordinary, as to
extraordinary, and at all times prophesying, that all out of office may
prophecy to the worlds end, if they have gifts.

Answ. Is there no means to edify, exhort, and comfort, but prophesying? and
that prophesying public in the Church and pastoral? that is denied, what say
you of private and domestic exhorting, praying, praising, reading, and
Christian conference, Coloss. 3. 16. Mal. 3. 16. Zach. 8. 21. are not they
singular means of edifying? has Christ left no means of edifying, exhorting,
and comforting, but the public prophesying of Clothiers, Mariners, Fashioners?
2. Faith comes by hearing of a sent minister, Romans 10. 14. It pleased God by
preaching, of sent Pastors, 1 Cor. 1. 17. 21. to save those who believe.

Robinson. 2 Argu. v. 31. You may all prophecy, that all may learn, that all
may be comforted; be speaks of prophesying of all, as largely as of learning
of all, according to the received rule of exponing the notes of universalitie.

Answ. Women, ungifted brethren, infidels in the Church, by his own grant, may
learn, but they may not prophecy in the Church, Ergo, many more are to learn
then may prophecy: and the one (All) is narrower then the other, for all are
not Prophets, 1 Cor 12. 29. therefore all may not prophecy in one and the same
verse, 1 Cor. 11. v. 32. and Isa. 53. v. 6. the notes of universalitie, (...)
and (...) (we all) are taken diverse ways; yea one and the same word applied
to diverse subjects is taken diverse ways, as 1 Samuel 12. 18. And the people
greatly feared the Lord and Samuel; and my son (says the Wise man) sear the
Lord and the King. Prove. 24. 21.

Mr. Yates said well, all ought to have the gift of hearing, but not of
prophesying. Robinson answers, every particular person is not bound to have
the gift of prophesying, but if he speak to purpose, he must say, that no
ordinary brethren out of office ought to have the gift of praphesie, which if
it be true, then ought none to strive for fitness to become officers, neither
were that reproof just, Heb. 5. 11.

Answ. He speaks to purpose, to destroy your Argument, which you destroy your
self, while as you grant, many may learn who may not prophecy. 2. He may
say truly, no ordinary brethren out of office, but purposed to remain
artificers, are to strive for fitness to the office of ministry; but many out
of office may have the gift of prophesying, who are not Prophets; and you
grant, I think, many are gifted to be Kings, who neither are Kings, nor may
lawfully exercise acts of royal majesty, without treason both to God and
their King: For the place, Heb. 5. 11. the Apostle rebukes the Hebrews, both
officers and people as dull of hearing, whereas they ought to be teachers of
others, (...), that is, (as you expone it) Prophets out of office, who ought to
prophecy publicly to the edifying of the Church. But take home this Argument
thus. Those whom the Apostle rebukes as dull of hearing, who ought to be
teachers and unofficed Prophets, are obliged to be indeed such Prophets; for a
rebuke is for the omission of a moral duty which we are obliged to do, or
for the committing the contrary, but he rebukes teachers in office, women,
children, and ungifted brethren as dull as hearing, for that they ought to be
Prophets and were not, Ergo, all, even teachers in office, women, children and
ungifted brethren ought to be Prophets not in office. Now the conclusion is
absurd and against your self, for you say, Page 58. every particular person in
the Church is not bound to have the gift of prophesying, women are not bound I
am sure, yet are women rebuked for being dull of hearing, and for that they
ought to be teachers of others, and were not.

2. Hence it is clear that you corrupt the word of God, and to be teachers, in
that place, is to be such, as so abounds in the knowledge of God, as to
teach, rebuke, admonish, and comfort mutually one another in a private way, not
to preach publicly in the Church, for the ordinary conversion of souls, for
which sort of Prophets you do contend.

Robinson adds. The Apostle cannot mean extraordinary Prophets, 1 Cor. 14.
there could not be such a number of extraordinary Prophets, now when
extraordinary Prophets were beginning to cease in the Church.

Answ. 1. When the Church of Corinth abounded in every thing, in all knowledge,
and utterance, and came behind in no gift, 1 Cor. 1. 5. 7. and so much grace
was given them in Jesus Christ, v. 4. It is clear there were abundance of
Prophets even then in Corinth.

2. It is not to purpose for lay-Prophets whether they were ordinary or
extraordinary Prophets. They were Prophets as the Spirit of God calls them, 1
Cor. 12. 29. set in the Church as officers, even as Apostles, and Governors,
and Teachers, who are officers. And there is no reason that you should impose
significations on words, at your own pleasure, without warrant of the Word.
Now show us in all the old, or new Testament, when the word Prophet signifies
a naked gifted man out of office, in the Lords house, for you have as good
warrant for you to say there were lay-Apostles, lay-Teachers, lay-Governors,
who were gifted persons not in office, as you have for lay-Prophets.

3. Multitude of Prophets may consist with the time, when Seers and foretellers
of things revealed in visions were beginnings to cease, even as the gifts of
the holy Ghost given abundantly at the Pentecost, Act. 2. 17. 18. Joel 2. 28.
did consist with the time when things concerning Christ must now have an end,
Luke 22. 37. Luke 24. 44. page 59. and 63.


Robinsons 3. Argument is. The Apostle in forbidding women to prophecy in the
Church, licenceth men. 1. The Apostle in, and for the work, opposes the men
to the women, Sex to Sex, and in forbidding women, he must license men, when
the holy Ghost opposes faith and works in the cause of justification and
denies that we are justified by works, is not then the consequence good, we
are justified by faith? 2. If in prohibiting women he gave not liberty to men,
where were the prerogative of men above women, which is the only ground upon
which he builds the prohibition? 3. Ver. 34. 35. Women are not permitted to
speak in the Church, yet may they speak to their husbands at home; now if the
husbands might not speak in the Church more then the women, what reason can be
rendered of the Apostle his so speaking? 4. The Apostle in the whole Chapter,
takes order that some should prophecy in the Church, and debarring women
therefrom, he must either admit men, or then we have a third sort of Persons to
prophecy, who are neither men, nor women.

Answ. Here is a great noise of Arguments for just nothing, and a fair
sophisme, concluding that secundum quid, which should be concluded (...); for
we deny not but some men in office are permitted, yea and commanded to
prophecy in public; and we grant that Sex and Sex are opposed, but the
opposition made by Robinson is creeple and throwne-backed, for all and every
one of mankind are not permitted to prophecy, as all and every woman is
forbidden to prophecy or teach in the Church; by the Laws of France a woman
may not sit on the Throne and sway the Scepter; but friend, can you say then
the Laws of France does license any Frenchman whatsoever he be to sit on the
throne and be King? Mr. Robinson proves men are licensed to preach, Sed
indefinita propositio in materia contingente ^quipollet particulari, but he
knows all men are not licenced to prophecy in public, for ungifted men are
not sent of God, and we say, neither all gifted tradesmen, never called by the
Church, nor educated in Schools, or sent of God to preach in the Church. This
he covers and proves never, only he sets down four armies of Arguments
to prove, I know not what, to prove forsooth that men may prophecy in public,
and not women, but who denies that? And the similitude of faith and works
crooketh here, for saving faith is opposed to all good works whatsoever, both
in kind and individualls, for we are neither justified by good works in
specie, nor by any one good work in individuo, but though all women be
debarred from teaching in the Church, yet are not all men licensed to teach in
the Church, but only those (say we) who are called of God, as was Aaron. 2. I
would bandy the Argument thus; It is not permitted to women to administer the
Sacraments, Ergo, It is permitted for any man, though not a Prophet by office,
to administer the Sacraments. The Antecedent is Paul's, the consequence is
yours; and so all these four Arguments prove not what is in question, to with
that; Ergo, a gifted person not in office may preach publicly.

Mr. Robinson adds, In restrayning women he shows his meaning to be of
ordinary, not of extraordinary Prophets, because women Page 59.
immediately and extraordinarily inspired, might speak without restraint, Exodus
15. 20. Jud. 4. 24. Luke 2. 36. Act. 2. 17, 18.

Answ. Robinson cannot show that the same kind of prophesying in women, v. 34.
is taxed by Paul, which is regulated in men, v. 26, 27, 28. and therefore that
connection is denied, he restrains women from ordinary prophesying in the
temple, Ergo he speaks of the ordinary prophesying of men; for, 1. he
compares prophesying with tongues, extraordinary with extraordinary, and he
desires them to covet to prophecy, ordinary he cannot mean, for in all the
Word you find not private professors are commanded to desire to be ordinary
Prophets, for so God should command them to pray, that they might leave their
callings and stations, contrary to 1 Cor. 7. 20. and give themselves to study
sciences and tongues: for if the holy Ghost command the means, he must command
the end, and if he command the end, he must command the means. But v. 34. he
sets down a new canon about women who took on them to prophecy publicly,
and he inhibiteth so much as ordinary prophesying, yea so much as speaking in
the Church; and I deny not but Irenaus adversus Hares. lib. 2 cap. 57.
Irenaeus, Fusebius, bistoria eccles l. 5. cap. 7. Tertullian. Cyrill.
Chrysostom. Theophylact. Robinson, page 66, 67.
Eusebius, yea and Tertullian, Cyrill, Chrysostom, Theophylactus, with warrant
teach, that always women extraordinarily inspired may prophecy, for in that
God immediately exalts them above men. But for ordinary prophesying in
public, it is of moral equity, and perpetual, that the women should not
teach, for Adam was first formed; this Paul brings as a moral argument
against women's preaching.

His fourth Argument is from 29 and 32. verses. Let the Prophets speak two or
three, and let the rest judge. The Apostle cannot (says Robinson) speak of
extraordinary Prophets, for they cannot err, but are infallible; but the
Prophets here spoken of are not infallible, because they are to be censured,
and their doctrine judged by the Prophets: now if such could err, our faith
were not immediately builded upon the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles.

Answ. This is before examined by me, the consequence is null, for the holy
Spirit (says Pareus) did not dite all things which the Prophets spoke, they
might have mixed in some thing Par^us com. ibi.
of their own. Paul's presbytery, chap. 16. page 251, 252. page 69. 70.


Robinson says, that Paul could not have said, (if any think himself to be a
Prophet, etc. let such an one acknowledge that the thing I wrote are the
commandments of the Lord) if these had been extraordinary Prophets, they
should have known Paul's writings undoubtedly to have been the Canonick word
of God, and could not have been ignorant thereof.

Answ. This presupponeth that these extraordinary Prophets might have been
ignorant, that the Apostles commandments was the commandments of the Lord,
which is not absurd, for Nathan and Samuel were ignorant of Gods will in some
points, for Prophets see and know sometimes as men, and sometimes as Prophets,
in the former they may err, in the latter they are infallible.

He subjoyneth. The word of God came it to you, or came it from you? if the
word of God came after a sort to the Corinthians, and not from them, then were
they not immediately and extraordinarily inspired, whereas indeed the Word of
God came from the Apostles.

Answ. This proves not the point, for he condemns the arrogancy of some
immediately inspired Prophets, Came the word of God from you? that is, are ye
above the Apostle to whom the word of God was committed, that it may be
preached to all the world, that it might come from the Apostles to others? Or
came it to you only, as to the only Apostolic teachers, that you need no
admonition? but hence it follows not, but they were extraordinarily inspired
Prophets, for Peter might be rebuked, though an Apostle and a chief one.
Neither is it any imputation to Paul, or to any who has received the Spirit in
measure, to be censured. It is true, Canonick doctrine, as it is such, cannot
be censured, but the teachers thereof, though infallible, even Paul, Act. 17.
10, 11. and every spirit is to be tried, whether they be of God or no, 1 John
3. 1. yea to say that the Church cannot be builded upon the foundation of the
Prophets and Apostles (as Mr. Robinson says, page 68.) if these Prophets
extraordinary can err, or can be subject to the censure and judgment of the
Church, is the very argument of Papists; for they say, that the Word of God
borrows authority quoad nos, in respect of us, from the Church, and is to be
believed, because Peter, Paul, the Prophets and Apostles, the then present
Church, say it is the Word of God. So Stapleton apud Whittaker. de sac. Script.
Authorit. l. 3. c. 3. arg. 3. sect. Bellarmine, Valentinian Gretserus.
Stapleton (as Whittakerne teaches) that Christ was the Son of God,
depends to our faith upon the testimony of John Baptist. See Bellarmine,
Gregorius de Valent. Gretser; So three famous commentators say, Transenius
harmon. c. 36.
Jansenius, Cajetan com. in loan. 5. in hoc ab ho^nine non accipio.
Cardinalis Cajetan, and Toletus in. Ioh. 5. tom. 1.
Cardinalis Toletus. But our Divines answer, that the Word of God is true in it
self, and the authentic ground of our faith, not because the Prophets and
Apostles say it is the word of God, not because Paul or an Angel from heaven
says it is so, Gal. 1. 8. for even the Prophets and Apostles were but men, and
so their testimony not infallible, but because God himself says so. See for
this Rivetus tom. 1. contrav. trac. 1. q. 6.

Whittakerus, Bucer in Joan. 5. de testimonio Baptistae.
Bucerus, Calvinus in art. 17. v. 10, 11.
Calvinus, yea and the Fathers most expressly say, that the Prophets and
Apostles are not the foundation of our faith, nor their word, because they were
infallible, but Gods word, by their mouths and pen. So Theapl^y^. in a^t 1^

Occam, and Gerson de infallibilitat Papae, consid. 12
Gerson do roundly acknowledge that their Popes word is not the foundation of
faith, quia Papa potest hereti^ari, because the Pope may err. What? because
Samuel was deceived in calling Eliah the Lords anointed, are not his books a
part of canonick doctrine, whereupon our faith is builded?

Lastly says Robinson. Page 70. 71.
Robinson, Pastors must preach and pray before they he put in office,
otherwise they cannot be tr^ed, if they be apt to teach, as they must be, 1 Timothy 3. 2. Tit. 1. 9. It is decreed that all may preach, Synod of England.
Ministers, Teachers, Elders, Deacons, and if there beam, ex ipsa plebe, any of
the common people, who would employ their gift for the good of the Church, and
it is practiced in the Colleges, where all must preach, though they were never
Priests.

Answ. 1. It is lawful, that these aiming at the office; 2. Brought up in
humane sciences; 3. Called by the Church preach, by way of trial, before they
be admitted to the office: but hence it cannot be concluded, that tradesmen and
artificersvoyd of learning and ignorant of the Scriptures should preach, not
for try all, or as aiming at the office of the Ministry, but as ordinary
ministers of the conversion of souls to the faith, and that without any
calling of the Church either to the office, or to the degree preparatorie to
the office.

2. All gifted should preach, yea and in England ought to be put in office,
where there is a reading ministry which Christ never ordained to be in his
house, and this the harmony of confession and Synods teach, and no more. It is
a fault that in Colleges all do preach, whether Christ has called them, or
not; such unsent runners Mr. Robinson cannot approve. Ambrosius com. in 4 Ephesians.
ut ^resecret plebs and multiplicaretur, omnibus inter initia concessum est and
Exangelizare, and Baptiza^e.
Ambrose says at the beginning it was granted that all should preach, and
baptize, that the Church might grow; and Origenin Number. hom. 11. cap. 8.
Origin said the same. But otherwise Hieronymus comment. in Matthew. in prcaemi^.
Hieronymus says, it is praesumptio temeritatis, a rash presumption for any to
preach, who are not sent; and Theophylact. in art. 20.
Theophylact calls them false Prophets; Augustine. contr. Faustum, lib. 16. c.
12.
Augustine will have them all to come before Christ, and so to be thieves and
robbers who comes not sent, Sicut Moses and Prophet^, as Moses and the
Prophets were sent. Coachman.
Coachman says, if preaching be tied to the ministry, and that order, there
shall neither be faith nor grace in a Church where there is no ministry.

Answ. It follows not, for faith may come by reading, by conference, and you
expone, Romans 10. 14. As Arminians and Socinians do. 2. We as Ambassadors pray
you in Christ's stead to be reconciled, 2 Cor. 5. 20. Ephesians. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 12.
29. Are all Prophets? Ergo, would you say no reconciliation in a land without
apostolic Ambassadors? It follows not, ex negatione unius medii, for then
there should be no grace, nor salvation, where there be none of your
lay-Preachers.

Coachman. Knowledge, judgment, utterance, with gravitie, authority, power,
makes a man a Minister, whether he be in office or not; Preaching is
accidental to the office, and no part of the office, but only an ornament or
appendix of it, a Minister is in full office of the order of Priesthood, though
he never preach; an office makes not a Preacher, it makes him only such a
peoples Preacher, when they have chosen him, he preaches by virtue of his
gift, not by virtue of his office.

Answ. 1. Here are Socinian mysteries revealed, Gerard. loc. com. tom. 6. de
Minister. eccles. c. 3. sect. 1. n. 70 page 78, 79.
Gerardus says, by this mean the Heretics called Pepuziani permitted, in
the primitive Church, to women, the Ministry of the Sacraments. And upon this
ground the Socinians and Anabaptists proceeded, that except a man would dig
his Talent in the earth, he may preach, though he have not a calling of the
Church; so does Mr. Coachman make talents, as judgment and utterance, enough
to constitute one a Minister, whether he be called to the office, or not. And
Gerardus sets down a good answer of Luthe^us tom. 2. Com. in Ps. 8. fol 96
lat. tradidi^ quidem Dominus talenta servis. sed non ^^si ^^catis. expecta
igitur and ^u donec vocc^ is, intereane amb^^s.
Luther to the Argument. God gives talents, but to those whom he calls,
therefore gifted men should in the use of their calling attend and accept the
calling of God. It may be the Church perversely set, denies a calling to one
who is gifted. Then I say, let him use his talent in private. God reapeth not
where he does not sow.

2. This is a wild saying, A man is a Minister whether he be in office or not.
A ministry is essentially an office, or a place that the Lord has called a
man unto, else define what an officer is, and how can he expone that, Romans 10.
14. how can they preach except they he sent? if as our Divines do? then none
are sent, but such as are called to the office, and this is against him, if as
S^ini^ns say, all gifted men are sent of God to preach, then gifts essentially
constituteth a sent man, and what is a sent man, ^ut a man called to the office?

3. Preaching is accidental to the office of a man that makes court and the
world his conscience, it is true indeed, but that preaching is accidental to
the office of a Pastor, is Popish and Prelaticall; for what is essential to
the office? to administer the Sacrament and consecrate the body of Christ? Well
said for the Popish cause. Fugeni^ de-(...).
Pope Eugenius in his decree and the council of Florentine teach us, that the
essential form of the office of the Priests is in these words, receive power
to offer a sacrifice in the Church, for the living and the dead: for says

is strange, if a watchman as as a watchman, and by office, should not preach
and give warning, Ezekiel. 3. 17, 18. if an Ambassador, as an Ambassador, in
Christ's stead should not pray the people to be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5. 20.

Chap. 5. Sect. 3.
The way of Church judging in New England.
WE do not (says the Author) carry matters either by an overruling power of
the presbytery, nor by the consent of Manuscript. The way of the Churches of
Christ in New England.
the major part of the Church, but by the general and joint consent of all the
members of the Church, and we are of one accord as the Church of Christ should
be, Act. 2. If any disassent out of ignorance, we labor to bring him to our
mind, by sound information. 2. If by pride be disassent, the liberty of his
voice is taken from him. If, 3. the matter be difficill, we seek advice of
sister Churches.

Answ. Unity is much to be desired in the Church with verity, but your way we
understand not.

Nor do we in our Synods carry matters by the major and maniest voices,
because they are maniest, nor because they are the the voice of men, but
because the thing concluded is agreeable to the word of God: but what if the
Church be divided, and the people (upon whose voices principally the conclusion
of the Church depends) go against both the truth and the Elders?

They answer, These are miserable mistakes, either to think that the people or
Elders must needs disassent, or that except they all consent, In the Answ. 10
32. quest. 9. 15.
there can be no rule?

I answer, it is a miserable necessity, through the corruption of our nature,
not a mistake; for Simon Magus, and forty like to him, in a Church consisting
of threescore, must dissent from twenty, whose hearts are straight in the
truth: You have no refuge here, but let the maniest carry the matter to a
mischief, and the other twenty must separate, and make a new Church presently.

Again say I, what if the Church differ? They answer, That ought not to be,
nor will it be, if the Church will lay aside corrupt Answ. to the 15. quest.
judgment and affections, and if they attend the rule, and depend upon Christ,
considering the promises made to the Church, Jer. 32. 39. Zech. 3. 9. Matthew. 1.
10. But if such a thing fall out, as not often it does, if the Elders and major
part consent, and one disassent; it is either of corrupt affection, and pride,
and so he Ioseth his voice, or of weakness, and then he is to submit his
judgment to the Church.

Answ. But to begin at your last, if one out of weakness disassent, he is to
submit his judgment to the Church. But I say, what if forty out of weakness
disassent from twenty, may not that whole Church as well submit to a Synod, as
Act. 15. as one must submit his judgment to a Church? the conscience of one
should no more be fettered, then the consciences of a whole Church.

3. I grant the maniest should have Scripture, but what if they say the
Scripture, yea and the Apostles are with them, when there is no such thing, as
the case was Act. 15. 20. the wrong side alleged Scripture and the Apostles
commandment, when the Apostles gave no such commandment, should you not take
Gods remedy to appeal to a Synod, as the Apostolic Church does? Act. 15. 6.

They answer, in our Churches hitherto, the major part, yea all mind one thing,
as Romans 15. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 10. Act. 1. 14. I answer, 1. that is because they are
in Church Government all one, and a conspiracy in error, is but seeming unity.
But 2. I say, good men as Paul and Barnabas will differ. But 3. what if all be
wrong of three parts, as 1 Cor. 1. 12. Some said, I am of Paul, some, I am of
Apollo, some, I am of Christ; all the three were wrong, in that case, does not
a Synod by the word of God determine the matter best? certainly, though Synods
may err, yet are they of themselves Christ's lawful way to preserve verity
and charity and unity. But our brethren answer us, divisions ought not to be,
and they will not but all agree in the truth, if the Church will lay aside
corrupt judgment, and depend on Christ, Answ. to quest. 15.
considering the promises made to the Church, Jer. 32. Ephesians. 3. 9. Matthew. 18
20. Let me answer, there is much more charity in this answer, then verity. 1.
They ought not to disassent from truth: true, but what then? the remedy is not
given except you return to a Synod; the division, Act. 15. ought not to be;
the house should not be fired: true, but the question is how shall water be had
to quench it, for many things are, which ought not to be. 2. (Neither will
divisions be,) that is false, 1 Cor. 1. 12. 3. As heresies must be, so scandals
must be, our author says (they will not be; they will not be) (say the
brethren) if the Church lay aside corrupt judgment, and affection, and attend
upon the rule, and depend on Christ. I answer. There is but vanity, and no
solidity (I crave pardon) in this answer, it is the vain answer of Arminius in
the case of the Saints perseverance. The regenerate (say they) cannot fall away
if they be not inlaking to Gods grace, and if they in holy fear take heed to
their ways, so says Ar^in. in declar sen. p. 57
Arminius in his Declaration; and in his Armin. ant^perkins. page 224. qua^nd^u
am^r Det in ipso^u^n cord^bus vigebit, imped^en. ui ne ^ccedant ^ D^o.
answer to Perkins: so also Remonst^an. confess. c. 18. Sect. 6. 7.
say the Arminians in their confession, and Episcopius disp. 27. chapter 9.
Episcopius. But what is this, but regenerate persons shall persevere, upon
condition that they shall persevere? for not to be inlaking to the grace of
God, is to cooperate to the grace of God, or with the grace of God, and to
cooperate with the grace of God is very perseverance it self; for says the
Socinus de just^^. ^^l. 10. quod si a^ hac obedientia deficiamus, etc.
the wicked Socinus, and Smalcius (...) 7 in Joan. fol. 78.
Smalcius, and so say our brethren, all shall agree in the truth, if they lay
aside corrupt judgment. And what is that, if they lay aside corrupt judgment?
that is, if they agree with the truth, and assent to the Word of God. But so it
is, that the best regenerate, even Barnabas, a man full of the holy Ghost, Act.
11. does not lay aside corrupt judgment. But our brethren proves they will
law aside corrupt judgment; but how? you allege the Papists abused
Scriptures, Ier. 32. God promises to put his Spirit and fear in his Church,
that they shall not depart from the Lord. True (say I) they shall not depart
from God, providing they lay aside corrupt judgment, as you teach us. But do
you not teach us by your answer to elude these pregnant places, which
unanswerably prove the necessity of the perseverance of the regenerated? But 2.
what though God promise to put his fear in the heart of the regenerate? this
promise is not made to the visible Church conveened in a Synod, as it is such,
nor will it prove that a Synod shall all agree in the truth, and that the whole
Church shall lay aside corrupt judgment, except you serve your selves with
these and the like places, as Papists, and by name as Bellarmine, G^etserus,
Snarez, Bucanus, Stapleton, Gregorius de Valentia do serve themselves with
them, and the like, to prove that Councels are in fallible. What is said in the
fourth Section anent the power of the people in Church-govern^^^^ is already
examined, only in the closure thereof, they seem to give something peculiar
to the Elders, which the people have not, which I discuss in the ensuing
question.

Quest. VIII. What peculiar auhority is in the Eldership, for the which they
are over the people, in the Lord, according to the doctrine of our brethren?

We hold that Christ has given a superiority to Pastors and Overseers in his
House, whereby they are, by office, government, and power of the keys, above
the people. But 1. this authority is limited, and conditional, not absolute,
as if they may do what they please. 2. It is a power ministerial, not a
Dominion; for as mere Servants and Ambassadors of Christ, they do but
declare the will and commandment of the King of Kings. 3. When this authority
is not exercised by the precise rule and prescript of the Law of God, it is not
valid, but null, and of no force. 4. They are so above the people, as 1. they
are their Servants, for Christ's sake, 2 Cor. 4. 5. yea we are their servants
servants: not as if the people had a dominion over the Pastors, or as if they
had their authority from the people, they have it immediately from Christ, but
because all their service is for the good, and the salvation of the people. 5.
They have so superiority, as they are subject to the Prophets to be judged, and
censured by the Church representative of Pastors, Doctors and Elders.

It will be found that our brethren give no authority or superiority to the
Eldership above the people. In their answers to the 32. questions. We
acknowledge (say they) a Presbytery, Answ to 32. quest. q. 15.
whose work it is, to teach and rule, and whom the people ought to obey, and
condemn a mere popular government, such as our writers condemn in Morellius.

Answ. So say our brethren in their Doctrine, we acknowledge that the people,
and gifted men not in office, should teach, and all the faithful is the
governing Church, to which Christ has committed the keys, and power of
ordination, and highest Church censures, even excmmunication, and that the
Elders should obey the Church of believers. Ergo, in teaching and ^uling you
acknowledge no Presbytery. 2. Seeing you ordain the Elders to be ordained by
the imposition of the peoples hands, to be elected, called, censured,
excommunicated, exauthorited, show us why the people are not the Rulers, (...),
and the Elders ruled. 3. The key of knowledge is a chief part of the keys,
and these keys by which sins are remitted and retained, and men bound or
loosed on earth and heaven: and seeing Morellius, Anabaptists, and your selves
teach that these keys were given to the whole Church of believers, how do you
think that people are not in teaching, Overseers as properly as the Elders,
and that your government is merely popular, as Morellius taught? to say
nothing that when you deny your government to be merely popular, you do not
deny, but it is popular; for a government merely popular admits of public
men to rule for the people, and we never read of a government in Athens,
Lacedemonia, or any where, in the which all the people did actually judge,
rule, and command, and so was merely popular.

But the Word of God gives a real superiority to the Pastors and Church
guides over the people in the Lord, as Jer. 1. 10. So I have set thee this day
over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and
to destroy, and to throw down, to build and to plant, here is a real authority
given to Jeremiah, only by his office of his prophesying, without any power of
the seals or sacrificing, or judging, or governing, which was the part of the
Tribe of Levi, of which Tribe Jeremiah was not, Matthew. 10. v. 40. He who
receives you, receives me, Luke 10. 16. He that hears you, hears me, he
that despises you, despises me, and he that despises me, despises him that
sent me, John 13. 20. 2 Cor. 10. 8. For though I should boast something of the
authority which the Lord has given us for edisication, and not for your
destruction, I should not be ashamed, 1 Cor. 4. 1. Let a man so account of us,
as of the Ministers of Christ, and of the Stewards of the mysteries of God,
John 20. 23. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted, and whose sins
ye retain, they are retained, 2 Cor. 5. 18. And he has given to us the word
of reconciliation, 20. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, 1 Cor. 12. 28.
And God has set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, etc.
Ephesians. 4. 11. And he gave some Apostles, etc. 1 These. 5. 12. And we beseech you
brethren to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and
admonish you, Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit
your selves, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give an account,
Acts 20. 28. Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the flock over
which the Lord has made you Overseers, to feed the Church of God, which he
has purchased with his own blood, 1 Pet. 5. 2. Feed the flock of God, which
is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, etc. 1 Timothy 3.
2. A Bishop then must be blameless, etc. 4. One that rules well his own
house, etc. 1 Timothy 5. 17. Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of
double honor, v. 21. 28. 2 Timothy 2. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Tit. 1. 9, 10, 11.
2. The Lord in his house, puts a difference betwixt the Feeders, and the
flock, the Governors, and the governed; those who are over the people in the
Lord, and those who are under them in the Lord; the Overseers and Watchmen, and
the City over which they watch; the Stewards, and the family; therefore there
must be a peculiar authority in those who are Elders. 3. The flock is to obey,
hear, follow, in the Lord, to have the Elders in high estimation, to submit to
their doctrine, to receive them as Christ; Ergo, some authority they must have.
4. The Lord has given to them an oversight, Act. 20. 28. and has committed
to them a ministry, 2 Cor. 5. 15. has put them in his work and ministry, 1 Timothy 1. 12. 5. God will seek an account of the blood of the lost at their
hand, Ezech. 3. 20. Heb. 13. 17. and God gives a reward for the discharge of
their office, 1 Pet. 5. 4. 2 Timothy 4 8 Matthew. 24. v. 45. 46. Ergo, they must
have a place of authority over the people, which the people have not. 6. The
proportion betwixt the priesthood in the Old Testament, and the ministry of
reconciliation which is more excellent and glorious, 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8. requires
the same. Now the Lord in a peculiar manner choosed the Tribe of Levi, Deuteronomy.
33. 8, 9. Esaias 52. 11. Number. 3. 12. v. 45. chapter 8. v. 6. Separate the Levites to
me, chapter 18. 23. Josh. 3. 3. 1 Chronicles. 15. 2. Josh. 14. 3. 8. But let our Author
speak what peculiar authority, or what singular acts of authority are due to
the Elders above the people. The Church (says he) exercises several acts of
authority over the Elders. 1. In calling and electing them to office, and
ordaining them in defect of the Presbytery.

I answer. 1. Calling and electing are not to be confounded; electing is no act
of authority; but that the people calls and ordains the Elders, wants
example in the word of God, and therefore the Author adds, that the people
ordains the Elders in defect of their Presbytery, that is, where there is no
Presbytery; then in case of extraordinary necessity, and where the Church is
not constituted, they are to ordain the Elders, but in a Constitute Church,
the power of ordination is in the Presbytery; Ergo, ordinarily the people do
not exercise this authority over the Elders.

2. The Church of believers, says the Author, sends forth the Elders for the
public service of the Church; as the whole Church of Jerusalem sent forth
chosen Ministers, with letters of instruction to Antioch, and to other
Churches, Act. 15. 22. Now the Ambassador is not greater then he that sent
him, but usually inferior, Joh. 13. 16.

Answ. 1. I deny not, but a Church of believers in the least Congregation is
greater then any Pastor, or number of Pastors, as they are such; for the
Pastors are servants for the Church, and means for the end, and less and
inferior in respect of Christian dignity, but this is not the point, we do
not now dispute of Christian dignity, one redeemed soul in that respect is of
more worth then a thousand Pastors as they are but mere Pastors, but because
the Church sends the Elders, the Elders are a part, and a great part of the
visible Church, which also send themselves; but it proves not the Peoples
Church authority, as they are contradistinguished from Elders to be superior
and above the authority of Elders; for here the comparison must not be betwixt
one or two Elders, and the Church including all the people and the rest of the
Elders, but the comparison is betwixt spece and spece, the office and dignity
and authority of the Elders as Elders, and the people as people; and the
Church of Jerusalem was not a Parishionall, but a Presbyteriall Church,
consisting of many Elders, and Congregations: now we deny not two Elders to be
inferior in authority to the whole College of Elders and people, and so there
is no authority of the people above the Elders, from this proved.

2. Morton Grand Imposture. Sect 5. Page 47.
Morton answers Papists in the like argument, that sending proves only that
those who are sent, are not superiors to those who sent them, for the Father
sent his Son into the world.

3. (Says the Author) if an Elder or a whole Eldership err, the Church may
call him, or them to account, and in case of obstinacy excommunicate them: for
it is not reason that Elders should want the medicine of excommunication to
save their souls, if they stand in need thereof, more then other. As Peter
gave an account, Act. 11. to the Church of Jerusalem of his going in to the
uncircumoised.

Answ. 1. If a warrant or example from the word, that one single company of
sole believers wanting Elders, did in a Church way censure any one Pastor, or a
whole Eldership, and that the Church of Jerusalem consisting only of believers
without Elders, called Peter before them judicially to give an account of going
in to the uncircumcised, is a dream: and though Peter should have given
satisfaction to a number of sole believers, to remove the scandal, it proves
not that they had authority over Peter, for one private offender is obliged to
give an account, and a satisfaction to another private brother, whom he has
offended, Matthew. 18. 15. yet has not a brother Church authority over one
another, to excommunicate him, as our brethren say, that a company of only
private believers may excommunicate all the Elders of the Congregation. 2. It
follows not that Elders should want the medicine of excommunication, when
they stand in need thereof, because the people may not excommunicate them, for
there be others who of office should excommunicate; and also the want of a
mean of salvation, as the want of baptism, where such are wanting, as have
the only Church power, to administer such means, does not condemn men.

On the other side, (says the Author) the Elders have rule over the Church,
and that in sundry Acts, as 1. in calling together the Church upon any weighty
occasion, Act. 6. 2.

Answ. 1. This power of conveening the multitude, cannot be the power of
governing Gods house spoken of, 2 Timothy 3, 4, 5. Tit. 1. 5. to obey those who
watch for our souls, Heb. 13. 17. cannot be to conveene to a Church meeting
at their commandment. 2. To conveen the Church meeting or Synods, is an action
of the whole Church, for Christ has given power to his own Church an
ecclesiastic power to conveen her own Courts, and this can no more be a
peculiar act of authority, agreeing only to the Elders, or to a Pastor, then
the act of excommunication, for it is given to all the faithful by your own
grounds, 1 Cor. 5. 4. 1 Cor. 11. 18 1 Cor. 14. 23. how then is it a peculiar
act of auhoritie in the Elders? 1. The Elders, if they be to be accused and
censured, are they to conveen the Judicatory, as the Consul did conveen the
Senate, and to summon themselves? also if they have any power to conveen the
Church, it is but delegated, for orders sake, to them, by the Church; Ergo,
this authority is principally and first in the Church, and so it is no
authority peculiar to the Elders; also, if it be but a thing of mere order,
it is not an act of jurisdiction over the Church; a Moderator who conveeneth
the Synod, or a Consul who conveenth the Senate, have not in that, jurisdiction
or authority over the Synod or Senate, and may the Elders hinder, I pray you,
the conveening of the Church? I think not.

3. This is but a Popish argument, Pope Julius the third, in his Bull takes
this upon him, to conveene Counsels. The Ar^ 1547. 9. Sess. of Trent. April.
21. An. 1548.
Cardinal de Monte President for the Pope gave leave by a special Bull from
the Pope to the Council of Trent to advise about the translating of the
Council from Trent to Bonony. And Bellar. l. 1. de council. c. 12.
Good Bellarmine and Harding 4. Article of Peter's suprema^^e as ^^well says.
Harding, as Jewel teaches us, make this a part of the transcendent power and
authority of the Pope over the Church, to conveen the Church Catholic; and if
it be an act of authority over the Church to conveene the Church, far more
must it be in the Pope to conveene the Catholic Church.

Lastly, this power in Elders should be made good by the Word of God.

Secondly, (says he) their authority over the Church is in opening the doors
of speech and silence to any of the Assembly, Act. 13. 13. unless it be where
the Elders themselves lie under offense or suspicion, then the offended party
may begin with them, Act. 11. 2. Yet with due reverence observed, as to their
years, so to their place, 1 Timothy 5. 3.

Answ. If to speak first in a Church meeting, prove that the Elders have
authority over the Church; then one Elder has authority over all the rest of
the Elders, and must be a little Pope, or a great Prelate, for two or four
Elders cannot all speak first. We seek now an act of authority due to Elders
or Pastors, as they are such, and above the people; if you make this an act of
authority, you then give us in every Church-meeting and Synod a Pastor of
Pastors, and an Elder of Elders, and a Pope. 2. If this be an act of authority
over the Church, then have Papists well proven that Peter has an authority and
power over all the Church, for Suarez t^. detripl^^. vitr. disp. 10. de sam

Whittakerus, and Gerson t^. 4. in propos ut^^^. ad ^^ter scbisma.
Gerson says, as also Lyranus in (...).
Lyran, and Carthusian in locum.
Carthusian, It is like that James spoke first as President of the Council. 3.
The Author leaves this act of authority, as weak, and says, that the
offended party may speak first. Ergo (say I) to speak first is not an
authoritative act of Pastors as Pastors agreeing to them, by virtue of their
office, seeing this act is communicated to those who are out of office. Ergo,
they have not shown as yet any Pastoral act of office due to the Elders as
Elders; and if it were most convenient that Elders should first speak, our
brethren will not say that it is due to them by their office, but for their age
and gifts, and so they say nothing.

Thirdly, (says the Author) Elders have rule over the Church in preaching the
word, and they have power to teach and exhort, to charge and command, to
reprove and rebuke with all authority, 1 Timothy 5. 7. and 6. 17. 2 These. 3. 6.

Answ. It can not be denied, but Elders, that is, preaching Elders or Pastors,
have authority over the people in preaching and rebuking with all authority;
but 1. I ask at our brethren, by what authority of the Scripture is pastoral
binding and loosing an authoritative act of the preaching Elder only? for the
concionall or preaching power of remitting and retaining sins, Joh. 20. 21.
is all one with the power of the keys, Matthew. 16. and that is given (says our
brethren) to the whole Church, and by these texts are not restricted to Pastors
as they expone them. 2. Our brethren allege there is a twofold power of
preaching in Pastors, one by virtue of their gift, another by virtue of their
office. By the first Pastors do preach to Infidels, Turks, and unconverted
ones; now this preaching is not proper to Pastors as Pastors, nor is it any
authority peculiar to Pastors over all the flock, for all gifted persons (as
our brethren teach) may preach, and so the gifted ones amongst the people have
authority over the Pastors in this meaning, as well as the Pastors have over
them, and so the difference of rulers and ruled, of feeders and the fed, is
taken away. Now for the power of Pastoral teaching, the Pastors have authority
over the Church, but that is over the invisible Church of believers, and
regenerated persons, for Pastors as Pastors do not convert Souls, and so they
preach to the unconverted not as Pastors, or with any Pastoral care: for they
teach that Pastors, Doctors, and Church Officers are given, Ephesians. 4. 11. only
for confirming of those who are already converted, not for converting of
Souls, and by this means, 1. Pastors do not preach the Law, for the humbling
of unconverted sinners, they do not as Pastors, or by virtue of the office
open the eyes of the blind, nor are they Ministers by whom men believe, 1 Cor.
3. 5. nor are they Fathers who begot men in Christ Jesus, through the Gospel,
as 1 Cor. 4. 25. Nor do they pray men in Christ's stead to be reconciled unto
God, as 2 Cor. 5. 20. Which is strange and uncouth Doctrine of our brethren,
for all these acts ministerial are performed upon non-converts, who are not
properly members of Christ's mystical body, nor of the spouse of Christ, nor
members of the visible Church, nor the Sons and Daughters of the Lord God
Almighty, nor have some measure of sincerity and truth, as this author Chap. 3.
Sect. 3. requires of members of the visible Church, and these are not under
any pastoral care, really and in very deed, who are yet unconverted to the
faith, therefore the Pastor, if he convert any by his preaching, he does it by
virtue of his gift, not as a Pastor or by virtue of his office, as they teach
in their answer to the 32. questions, and so as Pastors they have no authority
over the unconverted within the visible Church; and this authoritative act of
Elders over the people, falls to the ground, by their principles.

3. This authoritative preaching does not yet make over to the Elders
authoritative power above, or over the people, such as we now seek. For 1. By
this ruling Elders who do not preach and labor not in the Word and doctrine, 1 Timothy 7. 17. by office, have not this power; Ergo, yet you give no peculiar
authority to the whole Eldership over the people. 2. The Spirit of God
requires an authority of overseeing and governing to be in Pastors beside the
authoritative power of preaching; for besides that a Bishop should be ^apt to
teach, 1 Timothy 3. 2. he must also, v. 4, 5, 6. be one, who can both govern his
own house, and also the Church of God, and not only must he not neglect the
gift of prophesying, 1 Timothy 4. 14. but also he must know, 1 Timothy 3. 13. how to
behave himself in the Church of God, and must be circumspect in receiving
accusations against an Elder, and lay hands suddenly on no man, and not be
partaker of other men's sins, 1 Timothy 5. 19. 22. he must not only be an
approven workman, to divide the Word aright, 1 Timothey 2. 15. and preach in
season and out of season, 2 Timothy 4. 2. but also must commit the Word to
faithful men who are able to teach others, 2 Timothy 2. 2. All which are singular
points of authoritative power of government different from authoritative power
of teaching. And so Titus must not only have the oversight by sound doctrine
to exhort and convince the gainesayers, Tit. 1. 9. but he has power in
governing to order the things of discipline, and to appoint Elders in every
city, Tit. 1. 9. Act. 4. 23. yea there is an oversight in watching for souls,
in governing no less then in teaching, H^b. 13. 17. Now this Author shows us
nothing, that is a peculiar authoritative power in ruling, governing and a
disciplinary overseeing of souls, which the Word gives to Elders, as they are
Elders, and called Governors of Gods people, as yet, yea all the people are
governors, rulers and overseers in government by them, no less then the Elders.

4. The Author says, Elders have rule over the Church in dispensing all the
censures of the Church, (unless it be in their own cause) for though they
take the consent of the Church in dispensing a censure, yet they set on the
censures with great authority, in the name of the Lord; yea it is no small
power, that they put forth in directing the Church, what censures are due
according to the word: as, though the Judge dispense no sentence, but according
to the verdict of the Jury, yet his authority is great both in directing the
Jury to give their verdict according to the Law, and in pronouncing the
sentence with power and terror; the like d^e the Elders in dispensing Church
censures.

Answ. This dispensing of Church censures has two branches. 1. A directing of
the Church in the quality of the censures. 2. A binding of the censures upon
them, or in executing the censures of the Church. For the former, if it be a
pastoral direction, it is all one with preaching of the Word, and is not an
act of authority by way of governing, but by way of pastoral teaching. But, 1.
We would have a word from God, giving this power of the keys peculiarly to
the Pastors, for if you give the keys to all the Church of believers, as
believers, and because they are Christ's Spouse, his mystical body, the
habitation of his Spirit by faith, then with your good leave, there be neither
keys, nor any power of the keys given to the Pastors as Pastors, and in
respect of their office, but only as they are a part of Christ's body; now as
Pastors or Elders, they are neither believers, nor the bride, nor a part of the
bride, but at best the friends of the Bridegroom, Joh. 3. 29. especially
seeing the Church as the Church, and as using actually the keys, does censure
and judicially prescribe the quality and quantity of the censure, as they are
directed, Matthew. 18. 1 Cor. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. yea and the Church judicially, and
authoritatively pronounces the sentence, and manner of the censure on the
sentence: for example, of ten collateral and coequall Judges, if two of these
ten be skilled Juristes, and shall direct the rest in the quality of the
punishment to be inflicted upon a malefactor, that direction comes from
them, not as Judges over the rest, nor by any peculiar power that they have
above the rest, seeing all the ten are equally and jointly Judges of a like
power, but that direction comes from them as skilled Jurists: So here, though
the Elders direct the Church anent, the quality of the censure, they do not
this by an authority above the Church, seeing the Church with them have
received the Keys; yea they principally as the Spouse of Christ, and his
mystical body, have received the keys, and the Pastoes and Elders as such
have the keys, not but as they are believers and a part of the mystical body,
but as they are Pastors and Elders they have not received the keys at all, by
our brethrens doctrine; yea as Elders or officers they are not parts of the
Church, but only adjuncts and ornaments thereof. For the second, to wit, the
execution of the censures of the Church, if they do it as Pastors, and by
virtue of their office execute the sentence of the Church as Pastors, they are
mere servants of the Church, not collateral Judges, with the Church, and are
not as the Judge who does direct the Jury: for the Jury does only cognosce of
the fact, but has no judicial power to pronounce the sentence or discern the
quality of the punishment, nor can the Jury at all discern any punishment.
But the Judge cognosceth both of the Law, and the fact, and authoritatively
pronounces sentence; but the Elders have no authoritative power in directing
the people to pronounce, or not pronounce the sentence; or what sentence to
pronounce, or what censure to inflict; for if they have this authoritative
power, then we seek Scripture to warrant this power. 2. The Elders must then
have the keys in a more emminent manner then the people or Church of
believers; so all be but blanke and empty titles given to Elders hitherto.

Fifthly, says the Author, The Elders have power to dismiss the people or
Church, and that with a blessing, Numb. 6. 23. to 26. which is an act of
seperioritie, Heb. 7. 7.

An. This is but an empty title also. For, 1. The Pastoronly, and one
dismisseth Doctor, Elders, Deacons, and the whole Congregation; and so one is a
Pastor of Pastors, and an Arch-Elder of Elders has authority, by this, over
his fellow Elders, and candismisse them, therefore there is nothing peculiar in
an official power, here to the whole presbytery, above the people. 2. A
majority or superiority is one thing, and a power of jurisdiction is another.
Blessing of the Church at their dismission is nothing, but a prayer of the
whole Church (the Minister being mouth) who blesses all, and is no act of
superiority of jurisdiction, or power of the keys, of which we now dispute.
And you cannot think that to obey those who are over you in the Lord, and
submit to them, as it is, Heb. 13. 17. is nothing but to receive a dismissory
blessing from the Pastor. And I much doubt, if the Priests blessing of the
people, Numb. 6. was moral, and if it was not typical, he not taking in
himself, but as a type of Christ, pronouncing the whole visible Church
blessed, sorypifying Christ our Priest, in whom all the nations of the earth
are blessed, Gal. 38. 14. And do not the people pay the Pastor home in his own
coin, for you make the Church of believers to ordain their own Elders, and
to lay hands upon them and bless them, so you teach. 3. Nor is dismissing of
the Church an act of authority, or of official power, for your preaching and
unofficed professors may dismiss, as well as they may publicly pray and
preach. 2. A dismission is agreed upon by the Church, before hand, and flows
from the nature of all public meetings. 3. Ejusdem est potestatis congregare
and dimittere caetum congregatum; you know to conveene Christ's Courts
authoritatively is due to no man on earth; the Church has an intrinsecall
power of herself to conveene (being the Court of the Lord Jesus) and so also
to dissolve, and this is the usurped power that the Antichrist takes to
himself to conveene the general counsels; as Bellar. l. 1. de conc. c. 12.
Bellarmin, Suarez de tripl. tra. Theo. disp. sect. 3.
Suarez, Pighius l. 6. c. 18.
Pighius, and Cajetan, de ^uthorit. Pap. ^. 16.
Cajetanus teach us.

Sixthly, our Author says; In case of Apostasy of the Church, or other
notorious scandals, or obstinacy thereof, their Elders have power to denounce
the judgment of God against the Church, and withdraw themselves from it; As
upon the Idolatry of the Israeli^es, Moses took the Tabernacle and pitched it
without the camp, Exodus 33. And Paul with Barnabas rejected the Jews for their
blasphemy, and turned to the Gentiles, Act. 13. 45, 46.

Answ. Here be two diverse things sewed together to make up one thing: 1. to
denounce the judgment of God is one thing, 2. to separate from the Church is
another thing; the former is an act of authority, being rightly taken, the
latter is an act of no authority. But for the first, to denounce judgment on
a visible Church, and that with a separation, is ^ nothing but an act of
Pastoral teaching, and so no act of official power of governing in the Elders
above the Church, is brought in all these six, and so yet the difference
betwixt the feeders and the fed, the shepherds and flock, the watchman and
the Also your unofficed Prophets may as well denounce judgment against an Apo
sta^ Church, as they may publicly preach mercy in the Gospel, and s^ this is
no official act of authority.
city, or the people who are to submit and obey these who are over them in the
Lord, who rule well, is close everted, and all the Churches are turned masters,
feeders, governors, rulers; for Elders have no official authority by our
brethrens doctrine, which is not in the Church of believers. 2. To denounce
judgment to an Idolatrous and obstinate Church, who by their Apostasy do
declare themselves, not to be Christ's body, is a Pastoral act of Pastors
exercised on those who now leave off to be Churches, and this is to play the
Pastors to that which is not a flock, and as unlawful as for a husband to
exercise the actions of a husband to one who is not his wife. 3. To separate
from an obstinate Church is by you thought lawful to all private Christians,
who would not defile themselves with the pollutions of the Church, how then do
you make it an authoritative act of ruling Pastors? 4. For Pastors to remove
the Gospel, and preach no more to an obstinate Church, is not, nor can it, in
reason, be, that wherein we are to submit and obey those, who are over us in
the Lord. My reason is, we are to be agents, at least, for most part, in
submitting and yielding our selves to those who in teaching and governing are
over us in the Lord, because they watch for our souls. But in their separating
from us and removal of the Gospel, we are mere patients and cannot be
agents. 5. Moses his removal of the Tabernacle, and Paul his turning from the
Jews, was by another spirits warrant, then Pastors now a days can dare to
remove themselves, and their Ministry from a visible Church, for Paul turned
from the Jews for their universal Apostasy, blasphemy, and opposing of the
maine and principal foundation of the Christian faith, to wit, that Christ
Jesus came in the world, died for sinners, rose again, and ascended to heaven,
etc. The 4. case, to wit, of any particular scandal, or scandals and of
obstinacy therein, cannot be the like ground for Elders to separate from a
Church and never preach the Gospel again to them.

CHAP. 6. SECT. 1.
Of communion of sister Churches amongst themselves.
I Here be seven ways, says the Author, by which we leepe the communion of
Saints in diverse Churches. 1. By way of The way of the Churches of Christ in
New England.
participation. 2. Of recommendation. 3. Of consultation. 4. Of Congregation.
5. Of contribution. 6. Of admonition. 7. Of propagation, or multiplication of
Churches. It is allowed by the consent of our Churches, that when the members
of any other Churches are occasioned to rest with us on the Lords day, when the
Supper comes to be administered, and neither the persons themselves, nor the
Church they came from, under any public offense, they be by us admitted to
the participation of the Lords Supper: for we look at the Lords Supper, not
only as a seal of our communion with the Lord Jesus, but also of our
communion with his members, and that not only with the members of our own
Churches, but of all the Churches of the Saints; and this is the first way of
communion with other Churches, to wit, by participation.

Answ. 1. We heartily embrace the doctrine of the communion of Saints, but many
things are here which are incompatible with your doctrine; as first communion
of Churches, which you call a branch of the communion of Saints, cannot consist
with your doctrine, for a Church by you is relative only, to the Eldership of
a Church, as sons are relative to Fathers, but a Son is not relative to a
brother, so neither is a Parishionall Church properly a Church in relation to a
neighbor Church; for a Church has no Church State, no Church Priviledges, no
Church-worship, in relation to a sister-Church; therefore you should say, the
Communion of Christians of sister-Churches, not the Communion of Churches, for
no Church by your doctrine has any Church State; or Church-worship in relation
to any, but to its own members.

2. This enumeration is defective, you make a Communion of Churches in the
members of sister Churches, in the Lords Supper, though the members of
neighbor Churches be not inchurched in Church State, by oath, as a member of
that Church, where he partaketh the Lords Supper; and why should not the Child
of believing parents in the death or absence of the Pastors of neighbor
Churches have communion with you in baptism also? for this communion in
baptizing, you deny to any but those who are members of that Church, wherein
they receive baptism.

3. if you admit communion of Churches in some things, to wit, in the Lords
Supper, how can you deny communion of Churches in other holy things of God? for
you admit no communion of Churches in the power of the keys, as in mutual
counselling, warning, rebuking, binding and loosing, for Christ has left no
common power of the keys in many visible Churches, who are united together in
an Island or Nation, or Continent, by which these acts of communion should be
regulated, and in case of neglect and abuse, censured according to Gods Word as
you say, for you deny all authoritative power in Synods, let me be resolved,
dear brethren, in this, how Christ has put whole Churches and their souls in
worse case then members of your independent Congregations are, for the keys of
the kingdom of heaven in binding and loosing, in excommunicating, that the
spirit may be saved in (...) day of the Lord, the removing of scandalls out of
sister parishionall kingdoms of Christ, the gaining of sister Churches from
heresies and scandalls, as brethren are to be gained, Matthew. 18. 15. 1 Cor. 5.
5. 1 Timothy 1. 30. by censures, the keeping of the holy things of God from
profanation, authoritative rebuking, warning, that others may fear, and that
the rebuked may be ashamed, and all these means of salvation are denied to
your particular Congregations, as if they were Angels and Popes, who cannot be
lacking in duties, and yet all these are granted to members of any one
particular Church, how has the care and wisdom of Christ denied these means
to many united Churches, and yet you acknowledge that sister Churches have
communion amongst themselves, and that seven ways, in visible acts of
external communion?

I believe this one argument, though there were no more, does strongly conclude
the lawfulness of Synods, and by consequent, the Law of nature would say, if
Christ's wisdom provide ways to regulate the public actions of the members of
a particular Church, that they may be edified and builded up in the most holy
faith, far more has he taken care for many Churches united in a visible
communion seven ways, that Lord that cares for the part, must far rather
care for the whole body.

4. You say members of other Churches are admitted to the Lords Supper amongst
you, by consent of your Churches, but what consent do you mean? is the
consent authoritative, by power of the keys? 1. This consent authoritative is
either concluded in a Synod of many Churches, and so you acknowledge the
authoritative power of Synods, if it be done and agreed upon in every
particular Church by them alone* then I ask, seeing to administer the Lords
Supper to any, and so to make in your Church meeting, that it shall be
administered to any, is (as you teach) an act of ministerial power over those,
to whom you administer the Seal, chap. 4. Sect. 5. Now how do you exercise
acts of ministerial power, or conclude ecclesiastically to exercise these acts
in your parishional meeting toward those over whom you have no ministerial
power? for members of neighbor Churches are under no ministerial power in
your particular Church, as you teach in the same place, as you can exercise no
power of the keys when some are absent, that is tyranny upon the conscience,
says Answorth page 42. 43. in his Animadver.
Answorth, who will have none censured, or excommunicated, except the whole
congregation be present: also he who of another Church communicates with you,
1. Has no faith of the lawful calling, and choosing your Ministers, for he
neither could nor ought to be present thereat. 2. He knows not but he may be
leavened by a scandalous lump, which leaveneth the whole Church, and is
enough, as you say (chap. 4. Sect.) to hold any from communicating in the
Seals with any Church. Now these and many other things he must take in trust
from you, which Answorth thinks tyranny of conscience; neither can a letter
of recommendation make one of another congregation, capable of Seals with you;
for to dispone is to alienate and give away the ministerial power of the
Seals to another Church. Now this power (say you, chap. 5. Sect. 4.) is a part
of the liberty wherewith Christ has made you free, and so you cannot dispone
it to another Church, except you bring your self in bondage, contrary to Gal.
5. 1.

5. Mr. Best. Best. the Churches plea. page
and your Chap. 4. Ser. 5.
self, bold that a Pastor can exercise no pastoral act, but over his own
flock, and you say that the Scripture says so, Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 2.
Ergo, either to administer the Lords Supper, is no pastoral Act, and may be
done by non-Pastors, (as Arminians and Socinians destroying the necessity of a
ministry, do aver) or then a Minister cannot administer the Lords Supper to
any but his own flock: see you to this.

6. If the sister Church lie under any offense, you will not admit any of their
members to the Lords Supper, though these members be of approven piety; and
why? What a separation is this? What if these members do not consent to that
offense, as some of the godly in Corinth might be humbled and mourn, that the
Church did not cast out the incestuous person, shall they be debarred by you
from the seals, because they separate not from that infected lump? the Apostle
allows communicating, (so that every one examine himself, 1 Cor. 11. 21.
30.) with drunken persons, and where many were stricken of God, with death, and
diverse diseases, as eating and drinking their own damnation.

7. You look at the Lords Supper, as a seal of communion with all the
Churches of the Saints. What communion mean you? invisible? no. You deny that
the seals are given to the invisible Church, and the members thereof, but to
the visible Church, as you say; Chap. 4. Sect. 6.
If you mean a visible communion of all the visible Churches of the Saints,
why then brother do you call the universal visible Church a Chimera, or a
dream, as you say? Chap. 1. Ser. 2.
and if all the visible Churches have a visible communion, it is to deny
Christ's wisdom and care of his Church, to deny the lawfulness of a Oecumenick
and general council of all the Churches of the Saints. We recommend (says
the Author) Brethren for a time to other Churches, as Paul recommended Phoebe
to Manuscript. 6.
the Church of Rome, Romans 16. 1. 2. or we give letters dismissorie to such as
are for ever to reside in another congregation; but members are not to remove
from their congregation, but upon just and weighty reasons made known and
allowed by the whole Church, for we look at our Church Covenant, as an
everlasting Covenant, Jerem. 50. v. 5. And therefore though it may be resigned,
and translated from one Church to another, (as Gods hand shall direct) yet it
is not to be violated, and rejected by us; if members cut off themselves by
excommunication, it is their own fault; if any upon light reasons be
importunately desirous to remove, the Church is to use indulgence, as not
willing to make the Church of God a prison, but often the hand of God in
poverty and scandal follows such, and drives them to return: when a person
recommended by letters comes to another congregation, the Church by lifting
up their hands, or by silence receive him; if he ^e altogether unknown, and
doubted of, because the Church may err, be is not received till due trial be
taken of him.

Answ. We see not how letters of recommendation, most lawful, as we judge, and
necessary, can resign ministerial power, a liberty bought with Christ's blood,
(as you say) to any other Church, for we think all the visible Churches are one
Catholic visible Church, and should have a visible communion, and so that
there is no resignation of ministerial power in these letters, but they are
declaratory of the Christian behavior of the dismissed Christian. We ask if
dimissory letters be authoritative, and done by the Church as the Church, and
how can a Church usurp authority (by your way) over a sister Church to
recommend a sojourner to a Church state and Church liberties, and seals of the
Covenant? one Church has no authority over another. If these letters be
merely private, and merely declaratory, to manifest and declare the
sojourners Christian behavior only then he had power and right without these
letters, or any act of resignation, or giving away ministerial power, to be a
Churchmember, of the visible Church to the which he goes. Ergo, he was a
member of the visible Church, to which he goes before the dimissory letters
were written; and the letters do resign no right, but only notify and
declare the sojourners preexistent right, and so there is a visible Church and
a visible communion of all congregations on earth, and most be an external
power and authority in all, for Synods. Let our brethren see to this.

3. The person to remove must be dismissed and loosed by the consent of the
whole congregation It is true, none should remove from one congregation to
another without God go before them, nor can they change countries without Gods
warranting (...), Gen 12. 1. chap. 45. 4. but that such removal is a matter of
Church Discipline, and must be done by a ministerial power, is unwar^anted by
any word of God.
(it convenience permit) else he is not exonered of his Church-oath made to
that congregation; What if convenience do not permit? then is he loosed from
an oath without consent of the Church, which did by oath receive him. I think
eju^dem p^testatis est (as the Law says) ligare and solvere, that Church power
which binds must loose.

4. If the Church Covenant be an everlasting Covenant, as Jer. 50. 5. tying the
man to the membership of that particular congregation for ever; I see not how
the Church can use indulgenees, and Pope-like dispensations against the oath of
God, to break it upon light and frivolous reasons; for if God punish Covenant
breaking, so also should the Church, and can by no indulgence be accessory to
the breach of Gods oath, there is too great a smell of Popery, Arminianisme,
and Socinianisine in this way, in my weak judgment. But if the man be not
sworn a member of that particular Church by his oath, he is sworn a member of
the visible Church universal, which our brethren cannot well say. Neither is
any Covenant called an everlasting Covenant in the Scripture, but the Covenant
of grace, Jer. 31. 33. c. 32. 40. Isa. 54. 9, 10. and that is made with the
invisible Catholic Church of believers, as is the Covenant, Jer. 50. 5. and
not a Covenant with one visible congregation, and what warrant has the Church
to dispense with the breach of such an everlasting Covenant?

5. The testimony of other Churches, if it be a warrant to you, in faith, to
receive into the Church such a one as a Saint, and a Temple of the holy Spirit,
how should it not also be a warrant to you, to cast out and excommunicate also?

6. The person coming from another Church, if of approven piety, is received,
by lifting up of the hands, or silence of the Church, as you say, 1. Have we a
warrant from Gods word, for such a new inchurching? 2. Why is he not received
by a Church oath? as a Minister transplanted to another Church, must have
ordination and election of new, for to you there is alike reason. 3. If there
be no need of a new Church oath to make him a member of that visible
Congregation, seeing now he is loosed from the former, you in^inuate his former
Church-oath did make him a member of a visible Church, and so ^e that is a
visible member in a Church, is a visible member of all, and so there must be a
visible Church-Catholike, if there be a Catholic visible membership in any one
member, and so you destroy what you build.

Manuscr. 16. A third way of Communion with other Churches (says the Author)
is by seeking their help and presence. 1. In admitting of members. 2. In case
of differences of judgments. 3. In matters dark and doubtsome.

Answ. We seek a warrant from the word for this, for Elders are present at the
admission, and choosing of officers, as prime agents by authority, not by way
of naked counsel and advise. Act. 1. 13. c. 6. 26. c. 14. 23. Act. 13. 3. 1 Timothy 1. 13.

Manuscr. The fourth way, (says he) is by gathering many Churches, or their
messengers in a Synod, to examine and discuss either corrupt opinions, or
suspicious practices. Here 1. the Magistrate is acquaint with our Assembly, he
being a nourishing Father of the Church. 2. They meet in Christ's name. 3. The
Elders declare their judgment in order, and the reasons thereof. 4. All may
speak till the truth either be cleared, and all either convinced or satisfied,
as Act. 15. 7. 5. If things be not fully cleared, and if it seem that the
nature of them admit farther disquisition, yea and difference of judgments,
without disunion of affections, or prejudice of salvation, each man is left to
his Christian liberty, and if any be otherwise minded, God shall reveal the
same thing to him.

Answ. This Section being closed, I have here two considerable points to be
discussed; the one anent the power of Synods: the other anent the power of the
civil Magistrates.

Quest. I. Whether or not Synods have authority, by divine right, to obleige
the Churches to obedience, in things lawful and expedient?

For the fuller clearing of this grave question, I would have these
considerations weighed by the godly reader.

Consider. 1. Canons of Counsels may be thought to ^ye as authoritative
Commandments, or as advises and friendly counsels.

2. An advise or counsel does obleige and tie both for the intrinsecall
lawfulness of the counsel, it being for matter Gods word, and also for the
authority of the friends counselling, because the first Commandment enjoyneth
obedience to all our betters, not only inplace, and official relation, as to
Kings, Fathers, Pastors, etc. but also to all above us in age, gifts,
knowledge, experience.

3. Hence there is a superiority of dominion, or jurisdiction, and a
superiority of reverence, and endowments: the former is the narrower,
inadequate, and straiter subject of the fifth Commandment, and both are
considerable objects, in this Commandment.

4. All who as friends, equals, brethren, and endued with more grace,
experience and light, do advise and counsel good, are superiors in so far,
but it is a superiority of reverence, not of jurisdiction: for by this they who
are aged, and may counsel what is lawful, have not power to censure or
excommunicate those who follow not their counsel. Yet if David had rejected
the counsel of Abigail, dissuading him from passionate revenge, he had in that
despised God, unlessethe Prince or the High Priest had given that counsel by
way of command, though there be degrees of Latitude in despising the one,
rather then the other.

5. There is a difference betwixt hability to judge, and right or power to
judge: a Presbyteriall Church may have right, jus, and ecclesiastical Law to
judge of a point, to the judging whereof, they want hability, and therefore de
facto, it belongs to a higher Synod, where more learned men are, though de
jure the Presbytery may judge it.

6. Though government of the Church by Synods, be Gods positive Law, yet upon
the laid down ground, Christ has given the keys and power of Government to
every visible Church, the Government of united Churches by Synods, is a branch
of the Law of nature.

7. Synods are necessary for the well-being of the Church, and still are in the
visible Church in more, or less degrees, for the authority of Synods
consisting of fix only, differs not in nature and essence, from a general
council of the whole Catholic visible Church. Magis et minus non variant
speciem. And therefore if Synods be warranted by the word of God, (as no
question they are) there is no need to prove by particular places of the word,
the lawfulness of every one of these, a sessionall meeting of the Eldership of
a single Congregation. 2. A Presbytery, or meeting of the Elders, or Pastors
and Doctors of more Congregations. 3. A Provincial Synod of the Presbyteries
of a whole province. 4. The National Assembly, or meeting of the Elders of the
whole Nation. 5. The general and Occumenick Council of Pastors, Doctors, and
Elders of the whole Catholic Church visible; for all these differ not in
essence, but degrees, and what word of God, as Matthew. 18. 16, 17. proves the
lawfulness of one, is for the lawfulness of all the five sorts of Synods.

8. Grant the consociation of authorities in sundry Churches, and you cannot
deny the authority of Synods above particular Churches.

9. Consociation of Churches to give advise and counsel, is not Consociation
of Churches as Churches, but only consociation of Christian professors, who
are obleiged to teach, admonish, and rebuke one another.

10. There is a right of dominion, and a right of jurisdiction, as we shall

Hence our first conclusion, a general council is a Congregation of Pastors,
Doctors, and Elders, or others, met in the name and authority of Jesus Christ,
out of all Churches, to determine according to the word of God, all
controversies in faith, Churchgovernment, or manners, no faithful person, who
desires, being excluded from reasoning and speaking. Neither is the
definition of Fac de Almain de p^testa. eccles. et lav. c. 15. est congregatio
authoritate legitime facta, ad aliquem locu^ ex omni statu Hierarchico, nulla
persona fideli perente audir^ exclusa, ad nactandum ea quae concernunt publicam
ecclesiae utilitatem et ipsius mares.
A^m^in, and Ge^s^n de p^test. eccles.
Gerson much different from this, save that they think that counsels are
lawfully conveened, if such and such only, as are of the Hierarchike order be
members thereof, which we think Antichristian. 2. As also the Pope president
here, we disclaim. Yet does Almain confess that a general council may be
conveened without the Pope in three cases. 1. when the Pope is dead, either
departing this life, or civilly dead, being excommunicated. for any crime of
heresy: for the Apostolic Sea has vaiked often two years together.

2. When the Pope is averse and opposes reformation. 3. When time and place
has been assigned for the next general, council, as was done in the
council of Basil; and the Papists grant that, Matthew. 18. Tell the Church, is a
warrant for a general council. 1. Because it is a mean for the saving of the
spirits of all men, even Pastors and Apostles in the day of the Lord. 2.
Because Apostles, though in prophesying and writing canonick Scripture, when
they were inspired, could not err, yet otherwise they might err; and if Peter
should have remained obstinate in his Judaizing, Gal. 2. and resused to hear
Paul or the Church, he was to be excommunicated. 3. By the Church, Matthew. 18.
(says Schola Pa^s^r^ de poust. Eccles. page 17.
the School of Paris) cannot be understood, the Prelates of the Church only,
because Christ did speak to Peter; and says Almain and Gerson, Peter cannot
be both an ac^user, a witness, and a Judge. 4. There is a power of the keys
to bind and loose, given immediately by Christ to all the rulers of the
Catholic or universal Church visible; Ergo, the exercise of this power,
though it be sometimes (physice) impossible, because of the corruption of man's
nature, there being bloody wars in Christendom, yet it is morally lawful,
for many things may be inconvenient, through man's wickedness, and so hic and
nunc not expedient, which are morally lawful.

2. Conclusion; Every particular Pastor has a power, though unproper, of
dominion and authority, even out of a Synod, about the Acts of preaching and
determining truth; according to the word of God, as Jer. 1. 10. See, I have
this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, etc. 1 Timothy 6. 17.
Charge them that are rich that they be not high minded, etc. 2 Timothy 4. 1. I
charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick
and the dead, etc. So any Pastor has power of dominion and authority over a
Synod, and Paul as a Pastor might preach, even before the council at Jerusalem
passed their Synodicall determination, Act. 15. that circumcision was not
necessary, and that to obstaine from things strangled, from blood and
fornication was necessary and lawful, yea and in preaching truth the Pastor is
subject to no Synod. But the Pastor has not full power of jurisdiction about
his acts of preaching necessary truth. 1. Because the Church may for just
causes deprive him from preaching. 2. Because he cannot use the censure of
excommunication against those who refuse to receive his true and necessary
doctrine, without the Church join her power of jurisdiction with him. 3. He,
his alone, cannot in a Synod determine ecclesiastically, and in an
authoritative Church power, that same truth which as a Pastor he determined,
and with the power of pastoral dominion he pressed upon the consciences of
the Church, yea of the whole Synod, because one man is not the Church, or
Synod; and James his alone, Act. 15. v. 15. could but say, Wherefore my
sentence is that ye trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned
unto God, though this was the very word of God, which James as a Pastor, even
as an ordinary Pastor might have preached in the name of God; yet is it not A
Pastor may propone James the Apostles mind, aneut fornication, blood, etc. Act.
15. permodum consilii, as a counsel to some other Pastor, but it has the power
of a Synodicall decree not from James, though an Apostle, but from the joint
voices of the Synod; and it is not like that James as an Apostle said,
Wherefore my sentence is, etc. as an Apostle he should have said as Paul does,
what I received of the Lord, that I delivered unto you, etc.
the decree of the Church, which the Churches is to keep, Act. 16. 4. while it
be determined by the Church. An example we may have possible not unlike to
this. A man has a power of dominion over his own proper lands and goods to
use them in God, for his own use, but the supreme magistrate and Parliament
has a dominion of jurisdiction in a judicial sentence over those same lands
to forfeit them for crimes committed against King and State: or this may clear
it, Samuel has a power immediately from God, to anoint David King, and in
this he is not subject to the suffrages of the tribes of Israel, he has a
power of dominion here; but suppose we that Samuel live till Gods time, when
all Israel shall crown David King at Hebron, Samuel as a part of the Assembly
of Israel, his alone, without the suffrages of Israel, could not make him King
at Hebron. Hence we may see how weak the assertion of our brethren is, who
Answer to 32. questions ad qu^st. 18.
say, That Synods should have power to bind the Churches (say they) we see
not; Bellarmine de council. lib. 1. c. 18. Est tantum (inquiunt) inquisitie
quaedam and dictae sententiae ministratoria et limitata, ita ut tantum valeat
decretum concilii quantum valeat ejus raise.
Bellarmine indeed holds so. But orthodox writers hold that the sentence of
councels is but a certain inquisition of the truth, and a ministerial and
limited sentence, so that the decree of a council is of as great force as the
reason thereof, so says Amesius and Iunius animadversan Bellarm. lib. 1. de
concilae. 18.
Junius. But certainly this is a mere mistake of our brethren, as if they were
not orthodox writers, but conspirers against the truth with Bellarmine, who
hold the authority of Synods. The essential end (to speak so) of Synods is
unity, and the eschewing of schism; and we doubt not, but Peter, Paul, James
had in their Sermons, and doctrine determined that same verity, to wit, that
the Law of Moses and ceremonies was a yoke not to be laid upon the Christian
Churches, yet it was not a decree for unities sake, and fuller authority
binding the Churches to observe these, as Act. 16. 4. while it was determined
in a Synod, Act. 5. 24. 25.

But truly we hold nothing in this common with Jesuits and Papists, for we
condemn not that in Bellarmine, that he holds that lawful Synods (for of
such we dispute with him) do bind the Churches to obedience in God, to their
decrees, not because they say it, but because they say it authoritatively from
Gods Word; authority of Synods no orthodox writers deny, authority official
as the representative Church of Christ they have, He that hears you hears
me, he that despises you despises me; Where two or three are gathered
together (in a Synod, say our Divines) I will be amongst them. But authority
objective they have not, so as what they say, because they say it, therefore
the very matter, object and thing said by them, is no less the Word of God,
then if the Prophets and Apostles by divine inspiration had said it; at least
it is not infallibly true, because they say it, for that we disclaim, and it
is that authority of Synods, which Bellarmine and Papists hold, Counsels
(says Bellarm. de council. authorit. lib. 2. c. 12. Concilia and Scripturae
sunt ut raque infallibilis ^^rttatis.
Bellarmine) and Scripture are both infallible, and Rhemists in art. 15. 8. 10.
the Jesuits of Rhemes, and Lorinus co^^ent. in Act. 15.
Lorinus the Jesuit said counsels are infallible, the holy Spirit is there
present; Grati^n. dis. 19. in Canon.
Gratian said, all the decretall Epistles of Popes, and did. 20 can decretale^.
the Canons of the Counsels are of equal authority with the Scriptures: and
their Gregorius 1. Epist. 24.
Gregorius said he received with the same reverence and authority the four
general Counsels, and the four Evangelist^; it is certain (says Suarez de
tripl. virtut. disp. 5. sect. 7. men. 6. ce^^issimum est cencilium genera^e, in
quo ^aes^ns adest pontifex, esse infallibilem regulam fidei.
Suarez) that a Council is an infallible rule of faith, and Turre^^^m. su^n.
de Ecclesi. lib. 3.
Turrecremata says the same: It is certain (says Bailius Catechis. trac. 2.
q. ^. concilia nobis in di^ficultatibus sunt instar ora^ulorum.
Bailius) Counsels are ^^ the Oracles of God to us in difficulties, so says
Ca^etan. t^ac. de author. Pontis c. 9.
Cajetanus, (...) i^ Canus de loc. com. l. 5. c 5.
Canus, and (...) de ^alent, tom. 1. disp q. 1. de objecto fi^^: p^^ct 7.
Gregorius de Valentia; we hold the authority of Councels, but ascribe to
them as much power over the conscience, as there is reason in them from Gods
Word, and no more.

But 2. This is a weak reason, councels have no power to command obedience,
because their Canons and Decrees are of no more force, then they have reason
from Gods Word. For 1. Friends, brethren, equals, by that have no warrant to
rebuke, because their rebukes have but as much force, as they have reason from
the word of God, for the reason is alike in both; lawful Pastors cannot
command obedience in the Lord, your independent Congregations cannot command
that which binds the Church to obedience, because the word or a commandment
of a Pastor, or your independent Church is only a commandment ministerial
and limited, and has as much force as there is reason in it, from the Word of
God; yea the Church of Corin^h has not then the power of the Lord Jesus to
excommunicate the incestuous person, nor the Church of Thyatira, to cast out
and condemn Jezabell the false prophetess; nor do these commandments of the
Synod, or Church assembly have any power to bind the Churches to obedience,
because these commandments and decrees of censure are but ministerial and
limited, and in so far only of force, as they have reason from the Word of
God, as you say.

3. Conclusion: There is an authoritative power in Synods, whereby they may and
do command in the Lord the visible Churches, in their bounds; the whole
Churches are subject to the ordinance and decree of the Church, Act. 1. where
with common consent of a Synodicall meeting, Matthias is ordained an Apostle;
Ergo, all the Churches are to take him for an Apostle. This argument cannot be
repelled, because the Apostles by their extraordinary power did choose
Matthias. Because, 1. they themselves cite this place to prove the peoples
power ordinary, which is to endure to Christ's second coming, in calling and
electing their own officers and Elders. 2. Almain Almain de potest. eccles. et
civ.
a Papist alleges the place with good reason, to prove that a general
council is above Peter or the Pope, because Peter would not choose Matthias
without consent of the Apostles and Church. 3. If this was extraordinary that
Matthias was chosen, why then is the vow and consent of the Church sought? for
there is nothing extraordinary and Apostolic flowing from an Apostolic
spirit, which is concluded or done by the spirit ordinary of the Church of
believers. So also Act. 6. If the Apostles did not by the ordinary and
Synodicall power of ordinary Pastors choose seven Deacons, how do they first
require that the Churches of Grecians and Hebrews should seek out seven men?
v. 3. and did ordain them with the common consent of the whole multitude, v.
5. Act. 15. A Synod of more Churches give decrees which obliege the Churches, v.
28. chapter 16. v. 4. Ergo, Synods have authority over the Churches. Those who say
this Synod is not a pattern for after Synods, say far aside; for their
reason is, this was 1. An Apostolic Synod; 2. the holy Ghost was here; 3. the
thing determined was canonick Scripture. But this is a way to clude all the
promises made to Pastors in the word, when as they are first made to Apostles:
this promise, Behold I am with you to the and of the world, and this, I will
send you the other Comforter, who (...) lead you in all truth, cannot be made
to faithful Pastors, and the Christian Church, that now is, for it is certain
Christ is otherwise present with his Apostles, then with his Pastors after
them. And that he gave them a tongue and a spirit when they were before the
councels and rulers, as to Apostolic men, as Act. 4. 8. 9, 10. Act. 5. 29. as
Christ promised, Matthew. 10. 19. 20. Luke 21. 13, 14, 15. for they were full of
the holy Ghost before rulers, but by our brethrens doctrine, it shall follow
none of these promises belong to Pastors now adays in the like, because no
pastors now are Apostles. Surely this were to fetter and imprison many glorious
promises within the pale of the only Apostolic Church; and because Christ
ascending to heaven sent down the Apostolic spirit to his Apostles to write
and preach canonick Scripture, it shall follow he fulfilleth that promise, John
16. 13. to none now adays, because none have the Apostolic spirit in the
manner and measure that the Apostles had. Yea further it is canonick Scripture
that the Apostles at the last supper did show forth the Lords death till be
come again; therefore it shall follow that we have no warrant to show forth
the Lords death till he come again. 2. But that the Apostles in an
ecclesiastic way did determine in the Synod for our imitation, and not in an
Apostolic way, is clear by many evidences in the text, as Act. 15. 2. Paul
and Barnabas were sent commissioners to the Apostles and Elders about this
question: Paul as an Apostle needed not be sent to know more of the matter then
he knew, as an Apostle; for as an Apostle he knew the whole mystery of the
Gospel, Gal. 1. 16. 17. Ephesians. 3. 4, 5. Ergo, he was sent to the Synod as a
Pastor, and that as an ordinary Pastor. 2. They came together, v. 6. to
consider of this business, but as Apostles they needed not the help of a
Synod. Ergo, they came together as ordinary Pastors for the Churches after
imitation. 3. There was much debating and disputing, v. 7. about the matter. 4.
They set down their minds and sentences in order, one after another, as Peter
first, v. 7. 8. then Barnabas and Paul, v. 12. then James, v. 13. and to James
his sentence the whole Council agrees, v. 22. Now what the Apostles, as
Apostles and from an infallible Spirit do, they do it not by seeking light and
help one from another. 5. The Decree of the Council is a thing that Apostles,
Elders, and Brethren, and the whole Church resolves after much dispute, v. 22.
But all these, especially brethren, and the whole believers, as our Brethren
say, do not join themselves with the Apostles, either to write canonick
Scripture, or to give their consent to the writing of it, therefore they do
consent by a synodall authority, for the after imitation of the Churches.

Also there be reasons of moment for Synods; and 1. if according to the Law of
nature, and nations, no man can be a Judge in his own cause, then are
appeals from the Eldership of one congregation, when they are a party to the
accused person, natural, and from a Session to the Presbyteries and Synods of
many more Elders. But the former is reason, nature, Law of Nations. Ergo, so is
the latter. 1. It is best reason which has most of Scripture. Paul and
Barnabas, Act. 15. 1. 2. had no small disputation with those who said
circumcision was necessary; finding their parties could not be Judges. They
appeal to a general council at Jerusalem, where were the Apostles and
Elders; The Church of the Grecians and the Church of the Hebrews strive,
neither of them can judge other, and both appeal to a higher judicatory, to
the twelve Apostles, and their own Churches meeting with them, and there is
the matter determined a^ent helping the poor by Deacons; if the Judge do
wrong, and one particular congregation shall oppress one sincere and sound
believer, what remedy has the care of Christ provided for this? that the
oppressors may be edisied by Church censures, and the oppressed freed, and
delivered by remedy of discipline of Christ, whose it is to judge the poor of
the people, and to save the children of the needy, Ps. 72. 4. Now it is known
that Diotrephes does sometime excommunicate, 3. Epist. Joh 9. 10 (...). 21. 41.
and the evil se^vant rules all, Hieronymus co^, Lucif. and ^n Gal. 5.
Hieronymus says Arrians ruled all in the days of Constantius and Valens:

Picus Mirandula complain, there was in their time, no says, no truth, no
Religion, no discipline, no modesty; but all sold offices, Churches, dignities,
and benefices, and that ambitious Popes spill all, the Clergy entered by
Simony, ruled by Simony, the holy place corrupted. At which times all the godly
were crying for a free general council, as a remedy against the corruption of
inferior judicatories. Sa^ano^ala reputed a Prophet, counseled Charles the
eighth of France, to reform the Church, as he would return from Italy, with
honor, as says Philippus de Comin. l. 8. c. 2.
Philip de Comines. Gerson de coxil. unius obedient.
Gerson pleads for the necessity of a general Council. Genebra^d. Chron. l.
8. an. 991. page 554.
Genebrard says, for an hundred and fifty years, Popes, to the number of
fifty, had made defection, from the faith and godliness of their Ancestors.
Aventinus annal. Boior. l. 4 page 322.
Aventinus makes the same complaint, and Almain. in question. vesperti.
Almain also, that Prelates were more eaten up with the zeal of money, then the
zeal of Gods house. Is there not need then of a general Council? Hence came
also appeals from the Pope. The Emperor Lodovicus Bavarus (says German.
Chron. l. 4. page 227.
the German Chronicle) appealed from Pope John 22. misinformed to a general
Council, and the Pope better informed, and the crime was, because he had taken
the title of Emperor before he was confirmed by the Pope, for which he was
excommunicated. Sigismond Duke of Austria appealed from Pope Pius the second,
to the next succeeding Pope, and a general Council under him, for the Pope
excommunicated Sigismond, because he kept back Cardinal Cusan from the
Bishopric of Brixen within his Dominion; for the Bishopric was given to him,
by a commendam, by the Pope: See Aene is Silvius Epist. 14.
Aeneas Silvius. Philip the fourth appealed from wicked Boniface the eighth, to
the Sea Apostolic then vacant, and to a future Council; so Platina in
Bonifac. 8.
Platina relates. The University of Paris appealed from Leo the tenth, who
wickedly condemned the Council of Basil, to a future Council, as you find
it in the treatise called Fasciculus rerum expetendarum.
Fasciculus, etc. The Archbishop of Cullen excommunicated by Paul the third,
appealed to a lawful Council in Germany, because the Pope stood accused of
heresy and idolatry, as Sleidan com. l. 18.
Sleidan says. The Can. 23. q. 3. ne quis in propria causa judicet. See also
how great Romanists have made Councels a terror to wicked Popes and vicious
Prelates, as Fanormitan decretal. d. elec. signif. Cusan. concord. l. 2. c. 3.
c. 5. c. 10. c. 13. Ocoam. dialog. pa^. 3 chapter 3. c. 13 Almain. vesp. question.
gloss of the Canon Law says, the Pope cannot be Judge in his own cause; and
we all know how justly Luther appealed from Leo the tenth, to a general
Council: all which says that the like is warranted by the Law of nature,
where a particular Eldership and congregation is accused of scandals, that
superior Synods there must be to discuss such causes. And the good use of
councels you may see in one: The Council of Constance, Sess. 11. art. 67.
condemned John 23. because he taught there was no life eternal, Neque^aliam,
post hanc, vitam; pertinaciter credidit animam hominis cum corpore mori, and
extingui, ad instar animalium brutorum, dixitque mortuum semel esse etiam in
novissimo die minime resurrecturum. The necessity of Assemblies when common
enemies trouble the Church, prove that Christ has instituted Synods. And 1.
our present Author reasons from the Churches necessity, Synods may conveene
to examine (says he) either corrupt opinions or suspicious practices; and
cites for this the Council of Jerusalem, Act. 15. Now this council did
authoritatively command, Act. 15. 28. Act. 16. 4. Act. 20. 19. and not give
advise or counsel only. 2. If by the Law of nature, and by virtue of the
communion of Saints, Churches conveened, may give advise; then say I, as
communion of counsels and advises is lawful, so by the Law of nature communion
of authoritative power is lawful. As after the eye (says Almain de authorit.
eccles. cap. ult. prop 2.
Almain) sees the danger of the body, it should give warning to the rest of
the members to use their power. And this power (says he) denunciative, or by
way of charity, though not authoritative, is in private persons for the
conveening of a Council. As after (says Almain Almain ibid. propos. 4. Si
enim ligata fores dextera manus, aut ad mutum imaginationis pertinaciter nolles
vacare defensient co^poris, apud simstram tune defendendi corpus tota residebit
authoritas. E^si una pars provincia, inimicis volentibus earn destruere, nollet
suceu^rere, quis dubitat reliquam partem, quamvis sit minor numero, pro tunc
habere authoritatem totam provinciam defendend^, etc.
in the same place) any is instructed by a skilled Physician of that which is
necessary, for the health and safety of the whole body, he is obliged to use
that necessary mean, not now by virtue of the precept, or rather counsel and
advise of the Physician, but by virtue of the precept and authoritative power
of the Law of nature, for the safety of his body: yea further (says he) if the
right band were fettered with chanizees, or should refuse pertinaciously at the
nodde of the imagination to defend the body, then the whole power of defending
the body, should remain in the left hand. And certainly this is most natural,
if a foreign enemy should invade a whole Land, or any part of a Land, the
whole Land by the Law of nature were obliged with joint authority and power to
resist that common enemy. Now seeing a number of consociated sister Churches
make one visible Church body, having visible communion together, as the Author
grants in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is (says he) a seal of
the communion of all the Churches of the Saints, and in other external Chap.
6. Sect. 1. Bellarm. de Pontif. Romans l. 2. c. 27. says the Council of
Chalcedon, is of no force. Azorius instit. moral. to. 2. l. 5. c. 12. A lawful
Council going a nail breadth from the instruction of the Pope, may err.
acts of Church communion, as hearing the Word, exhorting, rebuking, comforting
one another, then are all these visible Churches with united authority and
Church power, as Churches, and not as Christians only, to conveen and condemn
a common heretic infecting all or any part of that visible Church body; and if
any one Church or Congregation under the pretense of plenitude of independencie
of government within themselves, should refuse to join with the whole, yet the
authoritative power of Synodicall judging and condemning such a heretic, does
reside by the Law of nature, in the rest of the body. If there be a communion
of gifts, there is also a communion of authority. And if a nation have
intrinsecally authoritative power under a Prince to repel a common enemy, for
the safety of the whole, then has a visible body of many Churches in joining
one external communion of sisterly consociation, under one Christ, one Church,
power to repel a scandalous heretic, who is a common enemy to the whole
Churches visible.

This Argument is grounded upon the necessity of Synods; our brethren are
forced to acknowledge their necessity, by way of counselling, and advising,
but Synods as Synods to be necessary, they think popish. The best popish
council we read of, is that of Basil, where it was ordained that Concilium
Constant. sess. 39.
a general council should be holden within five years next following, the
next council within seven years, and always after that, every ten years; and
in the Concilium Basil. sess 11. and sess. 11.
council of Basil the Pope is discharged to transgress that time of
convocating a council. Now the counsels as counsels are no popish devices,
but rather hated by right down, and well died Papists, as is clear by Gersons
complaint Gerson de eccles. potest. consid 10.
who says omission of general counsels is the Churches plugue; a lover of
reformation Fran Za barell tract. de schism.
Franc. Zabarell says, wicked P^pes neglecting general counsels, have undone
the Church. The learned Review of the counsel of Trent, l. 5. c. 6. by a
French Papist.
author of the review of the council of Trent says gravely, It is but a
theating of Christ^ndome above board, to leave the judgment of the necessity
of general counsels to the Popes will. and no marvel then Popes decline
counsels; for the council of Pisan (as Bellarmiu. de council. l. 1. c. ^.
Bellarmine grants) was convocated against Julius the second that wicked man,
and therefore was rejected by Julian the second in the council of Concilium
Lateran. sess. 2. and 3.
Lateran, yet this council and all the decrees thereof was approven and
confirmed by Alexander the first, who was accounted lawful Pope; and (b)
Platina (a) Platina in G^egorio. 12.
faith, this council was approved, and that in it Gregory 12. and Benet 13.
were deprived of their papal dignity, all nations assenting, except neither
Spain, the King of Scotland, And because counsels are against Papists and
Popes, therefore they have taken the sting out of counsels, as Ge^a^dus
prove^^, to 6. page 611.
and Earl of Arminac, who followed Pope Benet: and for approbation of the
counsels of Pise, Constance, and Basil, which censured Popes and deprived
them, and subjected them to a general council, let any man read the Review of
the council of Trent, l. 4. ^. 7.
Review of the Council of Trent, and Bellarmine is therein fully consuted.
Also general counsels have condemned the doctrine of the Church of Rome, for
which they think them not necessary, as the council of Frankford, says
Bellarmin. de council. (...).
Bellarmine, and Basil and Constance are not approved in all, because they
favor not the Roman Churches doctrine and the Popes supremacy above Counsels;
yea and general counsels cannot be simply necessary (says he Bellarmin.
16. c. 10. quemadmodum (...) annis illis 300. ecclesia sine conciliis
generalibus incolwnis mansi^, sice^iam potu^sse^ aliis C C C. and ^ursus aliis
DC. atque aliis mill permanere.
because the Catholic Church remained safe, the first three hundredth years
after Christ, without general counsels, and might have remained safe other
three hundredth years, and so a thousand years, and faults may be amended by
the Laws of Popes, and by provincial counsels (says he;) and their
Costerus Costerus in Enchir^d. de Pon^if page 135.
says, the Pope him self without counsels has condemned many heresies, and
this is a shorter and more compendious way, then by counsels, for it is hard
and laborious to conveene counsels, therefore the Churches salvation does not
depend upon them, says Bellarmin. de Pontif. R m. l. 1. c. 9.
Bellarmine, yea it is in vain (says the Jesuit pererius com. in Exo. 19.
disp. 2. n. 14.
Pererius) to do that by many, which may as conveniently be done by fewer, he
means councels may be wanted. Our brethren rejecting counsels, and their
necessity at all, in this sideth with Papists. Though Calvin. instit. l. 4. c.
9. sect. 13.
Calvin says, Nullum esse nec melius, nec certius remedium, that there is no
better, nor surer remedy to find out the truth, then a Synod of true Pastors.
And Arminians and Socinians think that Synods are neither necessary, nor
profitable; for as our brethren here give no authority to Synods, but to
counsel and advise: the very same is taught by a grand Arminian Episcopius
disp. 32. these 4.
Episcopius, who says, Synods are not profitable, for the establishing the
truth, or rooting out of errors and heresies, but only to advise, sist,
examine, and by reasons and arguments to persuade, and therefore are not
profitable, either for the being, or for the well being of the Church. Synodici
conventus nec ad ^esse, nec ad been esse ecclesiae absolute necessarii sunt; ad
veritatis divinae stabilimentum, and hereseon, errorumque averruns itionem vel
exstirpationem, eo tantum casu utiles esse statuimus, si ad deliberandum,
ventilandum, examinandum, and rationibus argumentisque persuadendum
congregentur; litium finem facere, circa religionis capita, aliter quam
persuadendo, est tyrannidem in ecclesiam invehere, and libertatem
conscientiarum, si non omnino tollere, saltem vehementer astringere and ligare.
To and controversies in the Church any otherwise, then by persuading, is to
bring in a tyranny in the Church of Christ, and to hurt, if not altogether to
evert the liberty of consciences of men. And the Arminians in their Apology
Remonst. in Apol. c. 25. fol. 289.
teach us that a decision or a determination of a Synod obliges not those who
were not present at the making of that decision. And so have I shown from
Answorth Animadver. page 20. Remon. 16. Decisi^nem factam in Synodo non leviter
habendam, quin and merito inclinare animos nostros ad acriorem decisionis
factae considerationem, sed ut ea cuiquam pros^ribat aut diffentientem cogat ad
assensum aut obsequium, ratio non permi^tis.
Answorth, and our brethrens doctrine that they teach, people cannot assent,
without tyranny of consciences, to the decrees of the Elders, at the making
whereof they were not present, and present, consenters. 2. A Synods decision
does incline the mind to consider of the decision, but does not compel
authoritatively to consent and obey. 3. This is violence to the conscience. 4.
To setch expositions of the word from confessions of faith, or decrees of
counsels is dangerous; and this is the doctrine of Socinians: for Theoph.
Nicolaid. in refu. trac. de eccl. c. 9. f. 79. Hac ratione Synodica errores aut
controversias non ^olli, sed tantum vim inferri conscientiis nostris.
Theophil. Nicolaides says, the Church in a Synod cannot decide controversies,
because she may err, neither can she take them away, for that were to do
violence to men's consciences: and Smalcius in refut. lib. de errorih^. Arrian.
1. c. 1. fol. 6.
Smalcius says, this were (tacit) quietly to leave the writings of the
Apostles, and commend humane traditions. So our brethren give nothing, but a
power of counselling and moral persuading to Synods, and no authority to
command, because (say they Answer to the 8. quest. so the Papists. Pighius lib.
6. c. 10. de eccles. Hierarch. calls general counsels, Constantini Magni
inventum, a devise of Constantine without any warrant of the word of God; and
John Weemes of Craghton denies counsels to be necessary by any commandment
of God, de regis primatu, l 1. c. 7. page 74. Cleme^s the seventh said,
Counsels are dangerous, if the Popes power be called in question.
in their answers to the 32. questions) Synods may err, and their decrees have
no more force then they fetch reason from Gods Word; and truly our brethren
with Socinians and Arminians here do fall in many foul errors. For, 1. all
preaching of the Word, and all power of authority of Pastors commanding in the
name of the Lord, faith and obedience, is only moral and to persuade, and not
authoritative to command, because Pastors may as well err in preaching, as the
Church may err in Synods. 2. Because what Pastors preach has no more force
over the conscience, then they have warrant to speak from the Word of God, as
is clear, Ezekiel. 3. 7. Gal. 1. 9. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. 2. All confessions of faith
that are set down by lawful Synods are null. 3. Liberty of prophesying, and
a Cassandrian license of believing in things controverted, any thing in this or
on that side, is lawful. 4. A perpetual doubting of conscience, except in two
or three points fundamental, that all Christians believe, yea and all
heretics, is brought in in the Church. 5. The Lords working with the word
preached, is but by way of moral persuasion. 6. But our Divines hold the
authority of Synods, and of Pastors preaching the Word from the Scriptures:
Matthew. 18. 17. Matthew. 28. 19. Joh. 20. 25. Act. 15. 28. 29. 1 Cor. 7. 25. 35
and 14. 29. 32, 33. Gal. 6. 16. Coloss. 2. 7. 8.
but I find both our brethren and Arminians do misken the authority of the
Church, and of Pastors in both Preaching and Synods, for they think to set up
the authority of Synods, is to cast down the authority of the Scriptures,
because things to be distinguished are confounded; for we deny that Synods or
Pastors have peremptory, absolute, and illimited authority, and power to
determine as they please in Sermons and Synods, their Power is limited
according to the Word of God, and their word is only to be believed, in so
far as it is agreeable to the Word of God; but hence it follows not, that
Pastors and Synods have no power and authority at all to determine, but only
to counsel, advise and persuade; for private Christians, our equals and
inferiors, have power to counsel, persuade, and advise in a private way by
teaching, Col. 3. 16.
admonishing, 1 These. 5. 11. 12. Heb. 3. 13.
exhorting, I. evit. 19. 17.
rebuking, Mal. 3. 16.
conference.

They build upon the reproving of events of counsels by Nazienzen ad Procopium
epist. 55. alias 42. Ego, si vera scribere oporiet, ita am^no affectus sum, ut
omnia ^piscoporum concilia fugiam, quoniam nulli^s concilii fine us (...)
faustuinque vidi.
Nazianzen, which is not against their authority and true fullness, and he
speaks of the counsels of his time, and it is not to be denied but
Panormitan de electr^ne, C. significast^.
Panormitan says well, dictum unius privati est praeferendum dicto papae, si
ille moveretur melioribus rationibus veteris and novi Testamenti; and Augustine
contra Do^^tist. l. 2. c. 3. priora concilia a pos^erioribus cor^^gi
Augustine says, latter counsels may correct older counsels; and Petrus de
Petrus de Monte in Monarchia Council. terti^. nu. 1.
Monte under Eugenius complained that there was no godly and learned Bishops in
his time, to determine truth in a Synod, when Doctors, Professors, Bishops, and
all have sworn obedience to the Pope, to their Occumenick counsels, and to
the wicked decrees of the council of Trent, as the Bull of Pius the fourth
requires.

But before I say any thing of the second question anent the magistrates power,
I shall close the other ways of communion of sister Churches.

CHAP. 6. SECT. 5.
Three other ways of communion of sister Churches.
A Fifth way of communion (says the author) is by helping and contributing to
sister Churches, Prophets, and Teachers, when Manuscrip.
they are in scarstie, as Act. 11. 29. Romans 15. 25. 26.

Ans. This way of communion we acknowledge, but we see not how this communion
can stand, without the authority of Synods; if Churches be not united in one
visible body, they cannot authoritatively send help of teachers one to
another; and this is a direct acknowledgement of a visible union of more
Churches in one visible body; for the Church of Jerusalem authoritatively sent
Pastors, Paul and Barnabas, as Pastors to the Gentiles, you will have them sent
as gifted men, and that they are not Pastors while they be ordained, and
chosen by these Churches to which they go.

A sixth way of communion (says he) is by admonition; if a sister Church or
any member thereof be scandalous, we are then to send Elders to warn them to
call Archippus or any other Elder, to take beed to do their duty; if the
Elders or Church be remiss in consuring, we are to take the help of two or
three Churches more; if yet that Church ^eare not, we are to tell a
Congregation of Churches together; or if the offense be weighty, we are to
withdraw the right hand of fellowship from such a Church, and to forbear all
such sort of exercise of mutual brotherly communion with them, which all the
Churches of Christ are to walk in, one toward another.

Answ. You acknowledge that same order which Christ commands, Matthew. 18. to
gain a brother, is to be kept in the gaining of scandalous Churches. But 1.
What warrant have you of the two first steps of Christ's order against
scandalous Churches, and to omit the third judicial and authoritative way,
when sister Churches turn obstinate? Christ's order for gaining the scandalous
is as necessary in the third, as in the former two. 2. Why do you allow the
third in a sort? for if the sister Church will not be admonished, you will
have her rebuked, before more sister Churches, that are conveened, that is,
before a Synod; is it because you think there is more authority in a Synod,
then in one sister Church? then you think there is authority in a Synod; for
by good Logic, we may infer the positive degree from the comparative, and
there is no other reason why the matter should come before a Synod, for all in
a Synod wants authority and power to censure, as you think, yet to complain
to a Synod is an acknowledgement of the authority of a Synod, as Christ's order
says, Matthew. 18. 17. If he neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church.

3. What is the withdrawing of brotherly communion from obstinate sister
Churches, but as Amesius, l. 4. c. ^. n. 26. de conscient.
Amesius says well, excommunication by proportion and analogy? Ergo, say I,
in this a Synod has a Synodicall authority over the Churches within the
bounds of the Synod by proportion, for who can inflict a punishment of a Church
censure, by proportion answerable to excommunication, but a Church, or a
Synodicall meeting, which has the power of the Church by proportion? Amesius
would prove that a particular Church cannot be excommunicated, because a
Church cannot be cast out of communion with it self, for then she should be
cast out of herself. But this argument with reverence of so learned and godly
a man, proves only that a particular Church cannot excommunicate herself,
which I grant, but it concludes not, but a particular obstinate Church may be
excommunicated out of the society of all sister Churches, who meeting in a
Synod in the name of Jesus Christ have power to save the spirits of sister
Churches in the day of the Lord, and are to edify them by counsel and
rebuking, as the Author grants, and why not by an authoritative declaring
that they will have no communion with such an obstinate sister or rather
daughter Church?

We have never, says the Author, been put to the utmost extent Manuscript.
of this duty, the Lord hitherto preventing by his grace, yet it is our duty.
The Church, Cant. 8. took care not only for her own members, but also for
her little sister, that had no breasts, and would have taken care, if having
breasts they had been distempered with corrupt milk: if the Apostles had a
care of all the Churches, 1 Cor. 8. 11. is that spirit of grace and love dead
with them? ought not all the Churches to care for sister Churches, if not,
virtute officii, by virtue of an office, yet intuitu charitatis, for charities
sake?

Answ. That you have never been put to these duties to the utmost, will never
prove that the government is of God, for Corinth, Ephesus, Pergamus, Thyatira,
which were glorious Churches by your own confession, were put to a necessity
of the utmost extent of these duties; yea it proves your government to be
rather so much the worse, because Christ's government is opposed by secret
enemies in the Church.

2. You make the spirit of love in a pastoral care over other Churches to be
dead, because none have any pastoral care over any other Churches, but the
particular Congregation over which they are Pastors, and pastoral love to
unconverted ones, as pastoral, you utterly deny.

The last way of communion (says the Author) is by propagation or
multiplication, which is, as the Apostles had immediate calling from Manuscript.
God to travel through the world, and to plant Churches, so have particular
Churches given to them immediately from Christ, the fullness of measure of
grace, which the enlargement and establishment of Christ's kingdom does
require, that is, when the Bee-hive a parishionall congregation is surcharged,
they have power to send forth their members, to enter, by Covenant, in
Church State amongst themselves, and may commend to them such able gifted
Ministers, as they think may be Ministers in that young Church.

Answ. 1. This way of enlarging Christ's kingdom is defective. 1. It shows
the way of enlarging the number of invisible Churches, and multitudes of
converts into new incorporations, but does show no way how to plant souls who
were non-converts, and branches of the wild olive in Christ Jesus, and to make
new visible Churches; but it is certain that the Apostles as Apostles, and as
Pastors, by virtue of their office converted obstinate sinners to the faith of
Christ, and planted them in a visible Church, consisting of professors of the
faith, partly converted, partly not converted; but the pastors by your doctrine
have no power as Pastors, or by any Pastoral authority, to plant the Gospel
where it has never been, that pastoral spirit is dead with the Apostles; and
in this, contrary to all reason and sense, and contrary to the Scriptures, you
make private Christians the successors of the Apostles to plant Churches, and
to convert souls, and to make them fit materials for the visible Church of
regenerate persons; for Pastors as Pastors, and visible Churches as visible
Churches do nothing at all to the multiplying of Churches, seeing Pastors and
visible Churches as they are such, by your doctrine, are but nurses to give
suck to those who are already converted, but not fathers to convert them; for
private Christians, or pastors as Christians gifted to prophecy, not as
Pastors, do multiply Churches, and convert men to Christ, as you teach, now
we all know that nurses as nurses do not propagate, or by generation multiply
people in the Commonwealth, that fathers and mothers only can do; your
Churches have no ministerial breasts, but to give suck to babes who are
already borne: but we see by your doctrine no ministerial power of Pastors or
Churches to send forth members to enter in a Church covenant, or to enter in a
new Church relation of a daughter, or a sister visible Church; if they send a
number to be a new Church, your Pastors or visible Church did not multiply
them, it is presumed they were converts, before they were members of the
visible Church, which now sends them out; and if they be multiplied in the
bosom of your visible Church and converted, they were not truly members of
that visible Church before their conversion, and also that they were not
converted by any public ministry, but by private Christians gifted to
prophecy, who are the only successors of the Apostles to plant visible
Churches: but what pastoral authority have you to send them forth to be a
new visible Church? none at all? they have as believers power to remove from
you, and because of multiplication, to make themselves a new Church, and this
ministerial power of making themselves a new Church they have not from you,
but from their fathers who converted them, so that you make a visible Church
within a visible Church, but not a Church begotten or borne of a visible
Church, as a child of the mother; and we desire a word of God, either precept,
promise, or practice of such a Church multiplication, man's word is not enough.

2. We hold that the sending of the Apostles to all the world was not in it
self, that which essentially distinguishes the Apostle from the now ordinary
Pastor, who is fixed to a single Congregation, but the gift of tongues to
preach to all the world upon the Lords intention to send the Gospel to all
nations, that as many as were chosen to life, might believe, was that which
essentially differenceth the Apostle from the ordinary pastor, together with a
special revelation of God, to go to such and such people, to Macedonia, and
not yet to Bythinia. And now seeing these two are taken away, the ordinary
Pastors which now are, have as Pastors a sufficient calling to preach the
Gospel to all nations, to whom by Gods providence they shall come, and can
understand their language, whether of their own Congregation or not. Neither
is a Pastor tied as a Pastor by Gods Word, to one only Congregation, for then
it should be unlawful for a Pastor as a Pastor to plant a new Church; but
shall it be lawful for private Christians to plant new Churches, who are not
the Apostles successors, and yet it shall be unlawful for Pastors, who are
the undoubted successors of the Apostles, to plant new Churches? I would think
that admirable doctrine, for so you give to private Christians that which you
make essential to the Apostles, and you deny it to the undoubted successors of
the Apostles, to wit, to Pastors. But we hold a lawful Pastor is a Pastor in
relation to all the world, with this distinction, he is by Christ's appointment
and the Churches a Pastor to all congregations, to plant and water, and preach,
but by special designation of Gods providence, and the Churches appointment
designed and set apart for such a determinate flock, just as the Apostles in
general were made Pastors to all the world, Matthew. 28 19. Go teach all
nations, but by special revelation and Apostolic appointment, Peter was
appointed the Apostle of the Jews, Paul of the Gentiles, Gal. 2. 9. yet Paul
was a Pastor in relation to the Jews, and Peter also in relation to the
Gentiles: so by special revelation, Act. 16. they are forbidden to preach the
word in Bythinia, and commanded to preach it elsewhere; and for this cause,
pious antiquity, as Morton Morton Apol. par. 2. c. 14. page 422.
observes, called some learned fathers Pastors of the World, Russinus l 2.
^ist. c. 26.
Athanasius is saluted Pontifex maximus, as Russinus says, and Origin magister
ecclesi^rum, master of the Churches, so Hieronymus de loc. hele^o.
Hieronymus, and Cyprian totius orbis praeses, Cyp^ian the Bishop of all the
world, yea and Pope, so Nazianz. Seimon. de Cypriano.
Nazianz. Hilarious is called by Augustine l. 1. contr. Julian.
Augustine insignis ecclesiae doctor, a renowned teacher of the Church, and
Nazianz. Epist. 10. ad Basilium.
Nazianzenus calls Basilius the light of the word, and Damasc. de fid.
orthod. l. 4. c. 17.
Damascenus the light of the whole world, and Theodoret. hist. l. 5. c. 32.
Theodoret says Chrysostom is called totius orbis terrarum doctor, the Doctor
and teacher of the whole world: all which titles says evidently that
antiquity believed never a Pastor, or Bishop, not to be a Pastor only in
relation to the one single Congregation, whereof he is Pastor, but a Pastor in
relation to the whole visible Church, though by designation of the Church his
ministry be appropriated to one particular Church. Thus it is clear that our
brethren deny all communion of Churches, while they confine a visible Church to
one only single and independent Congregation, subjected in its visible
government to Christ Jesus immediately, and to no universal visible Church or
Synod on earth.

Quest. II. Whether the Magistrate has power to compel persons to a Church
profession?

Anent Magistrates sundry things are questioned to make presbyteriall
government odious. And first our brethren complain that our Churches are
constitute by the authority of the Magistrate, Robinson iustific. of separat.
page 374.
Robinson says, it was a presumptuous enterprise, that people were haled
against their will into covenant with God, to swear obedience to the
protestant Faith, being a profane multitude, living before in gross idolatry,
and that by the authority of the supreme magistrate, for the commandment of
the magistrate (say they) can make no members of the visible Church, or of
Christ's body, because it is a voluntary act of obedience to Christ, that men
adjoyne themselves to the visible Church; Ergo, none can be compelled thereunto
by the authority of the Magistrate; faith may be counseled, it cannot be
compelled. For the clearing of this question, these considerations are to be
weighed.

1. The Magistrate may compel to the means, and external acts of worship,
and to desisting from external false worship of the false God, or of the true
God worshipped in a false way, he cannot compel to internal acts of faith,
love, and such like, as having no power over the conscience.

2. There is one consideration of a Heathen or Pagan nation which never
received Christianity, and the true faith, and another consideration of a
nation baptized and professing Christ.

3. A Magistrate may compel a heathen nation to the negative reverence of
Christ in a indirect way, and that with the sword, though he cannot compel to
the positive worshipping of him: if a Christian Prince subdue a Pagan nation,
he cannot force them with the Sword to a positive receiving of the doctrine of
the Gospel, but if it be a nation expressly blaspheming Christ, as the
nation of the Jews now do, he may compel them to an abstinence from a
professed blaspheming of Christ, because he is to use the sword against
blasphemy.

4. The weapons of the Church as the Church are not carnal, but spiritual and
mighty through God.

5. The compelling power of the Magistrate is terminated upon external worship
as abstracted from either hypocrisy or sincerity in worship,

6. Though no man resist the Magistrate in a matter of religion, except in a
hypocritical way, save only he who thinks he has reason (...), and is led
by the judgment and indictment of conscience to resist, ^et is not the in
litement of conscience, but only the Word of God ^et rule of man's obedience,
or resisting in actions, purposes and conversation.

1. Conclusion. Fire and sword, or war, or the coactive power of a magistrate
is not Gods way of planting the Gospel in a heathen nation, which never heard
of the Gospel before. 1. Because the Apostles were commanded, by teaching the
Gospel to all nations, Matthew. 28. 19, 20. Mark. 16. 15. Act. 7. 8. and not by
war, to spread the Gospel. 2. Because Christ's Kingdom is not of this world,
for then his servants would fight for him, Joh. 18. 36. nor are the weapons of
our warfare carnal, 2 Cor. 10. 4. nor is Christ's sword any other thing, then
the Word of God, Rev. 19. 15. Gal. 6. 17. And in this meaning, and with
relation to the internal acts of sound believing, have the learned taught us,
that, religio suaderi potest, cogi non potest: if these be the constitutions
of Clemens in constitut. (...).
Clemens, let it go for a truth in this sense, that God has given liberty of
will to men, not punishing them with temporal death, but calls them to give
an account of ^^eir doings, in the life to come: which yet cannot be
universally true, except that the Author with Anabaptists take away the power
of the civil magistrate; and Athanasius.
Athanasius meaned with us, when he cites that, If any will come after me,
let him take up his cross; to prove that the will cannot be compelled; and
that of Lactantius Inst it. l. 5. c. 19.
Lactantius is approved by all, defendenda tamen religioest, non occidendo, sed
moriendo, non saevitia, sed sapientia, non s^^lere, sed fide; illa enim malorum
sunt, baec bonorum; and necesse est bonum in religione versari, non malum: Nam
si sanguine, si tormentis, si malo religionem defendere velis, jam non
defendetur illa, fed polluetur, and violabitur. Nihil est tam voluntarium quam
religio, in qua si animus sacrificantis est eversus, jam sublata, jam nulla
est: all which tends to this, that religion is like freewill, and free will
like a Virgin which cannot be ravished. Let that of Tertul.
Tertullian stand, Lex nostra non se vindicat ultore gladio^ Procopius in Arca.
histor.
Procopius says that Justinian was blamed, because he compelled the
Samaritans to embrace the Christian faith.

2. Conclusion. A Christian Prince subduing a heathen Nation, may compel them
to desist from a negative dis^onouring of Christ, and from an external false
worship. Dan. 3. 29. Therefore I make a Decree, that every People, Nation, and
Language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Sadrach and
Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dung^ill. 2.
The Magistrate bears not the sword for nothing, or invaine, for he is the
minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on those who do evil, Romans 13.
4. Therefore he should be Gods Minister to execute wrath on those who dishonor
Christ. Nor must we approve of that of Tiberius, Ta^itus in Tiberio, De^rum in
^u^iae D^^s curae sant.
that Gods take care of wrongs dene to themselves: and that of the Emperor
Alexander, l. 2. God. de ^eb. Ged. juris juran^ts contempia religio satis De^ ^
ultorem habet.
it is sufficient that the breach of an oath has God to be the revenger. Yet
the Emperor In Lege nemo Codice de Pagan.
Constantine commanded all the Churches of the Pagan Gods to be closed up, and
Ambr^sius Epist. 30.
Ambrose and Augustine. Epist. 48.
Augustine both commended the fact; and Ferdinand King of Spain, commanded all
the Jews, who would not turn Christians, to remove out of Spain.

3. Conclus. Where a Nation has embraced the faith, and sworn thereunto in
Baptism, it is lawful for the Magistrate to compel them to profess that
truth to the which they have sworn in Baptism. 1. Because the Magistrate is a
keeper of both Tables of the Law. Ergo, he may take care that these who are
baptized, and sworn to be followers of Christ, should profess what they have
sworn to profess. 2. Because the Magistrate may compel, ad actus imperatos,
non ad actus elicitos, commanded and external acts of worship, though he have
no power over the conscience to command the elicit acts of will and mind. 3. He
may command to use the means of Religion, though he cannot force Religion it
self: and this Jehoshaphat, Ezechiah, Asa, and Josiah, and other good Kings
commanded, and in that are set forth to all Princes as patterns of zeal. 4.
The most pungent argument of our brethren in the contrary is of no weight,
because (say they) for one to adjoyn himself to the visible Church in a
profession of the faith, it is a supernatural work of Grace, and must be
voluntary, else the Magistrate should compel men to hypocrisy, yea and he
should, says Gregorius de Valentia to. 3. disp. 1. punc. 6. q. 10. de
infidelita te arg. 4.
Gregorius de Valentia, following Cajetanus, indirectly concur to sacrilege,
to profane the holy things of God; and fear of punishment makes an action
against the will, secundum quid, in some respect, and for the point of
supernaturality of professing, D^^andus 4. santen. d. 4. q. 6. (...). 1.
Durandus handles it. Now (I say) that this is of no weight, because (as
Suarez, de (...) disp. 18. sect 2. n. 5.
Suarez. says) one may be compelled to hear the Word, who yet cannot be
compelled to believe; so (say I) to make such a profession, as may constitute
any one a member of the visible Church, is no supernatural act, though there
be a moral obligation tying the professors to the supernatural sincerity of
the act, yet there is no essential obligation, as touching the essence of a
visible member tying him thereunto, and therefore the Magistrate may compel
thereunto, and so Antonius 2. p. 111. 12 c. 2.
Antonius following Gregorius 7. Epist. 30.
Gregorius do teach that an indirect compulsion to the faith is lawful; and
the compelling power of the Magistrate is terminated upon the profession, not
upon the hypocrisy of the profession; else it were as good an argument to
prove that the Magistrate by the sword cannot compel subjects to ab^taine from
murder, sorcery, perjury; because many in an hypocritical and servile manner,
for fear of the Magistrates wrath, not for fear of God, do abstain from
these ils, nor is their abstinence from worshipping idols, a thing of it self,
as the Magistrate commands it, supernatural. Neither would men by the
Covenant of the Lord, which King Asa did cause the people to swear, to wit,
that they should seek the Lord God of their fathers, 2 Chronicles. 15. 12. be
compelled, so as their seeking of God, should not be willingly performed. 5.
This opinion is the way to Arminian liberty of conscience, that men in a
Christian Commonwealth, may be of any Religion, and the Magistrate is to
behold men as an indifferent spectator, not caring what religion they be of,
whether they be Papists, Jews, Pagans, Anabaptists, Socinians, Macedonians,
etc. which should infer, that the Magistrate were no nurse-father of the true
Church, nor yet a preserver of Religion, if men might be of any Religion.
Neither is this the way (as says Robinson justif. of separa. page 224.
Robinson) to the Papists implicit faith, when men believes, as the Church
believes, though they know not what it is: nor is it a compelling of men (as
he says) to blasphemy, and apparent wickedness, because the Magistrate is not
to compel to profession of the truth immediately, and without any foregoing
information of the mind; for the Church is to teach and instruct in all the
external acts of worship, before the Magistrate does compel to these acts;
yea and the same Robinson. justif. page 373.
Robinson acknowledges that Jehoshaphat made compulsive laws about Religion.
Ergo, if he should execute these Laws, he should compel to some acts of
Religion, and should compel to hypocrisy, as the same Mr. Robinson argues
against us.

4. Conclus. It is one thing to command acts of divine worship, under the pain
of civil punishment, and another thing to punish, or inflict civil
punishment, when these commandments are transgressed, Christian Princes may
do both. And that they do the latter by Gods commandment and warrant is
clear, in that Jehu destroyed all the house of Ahab for Idolatry, and killed
Baals Priests. Good Josiah killed the Priests of 2 King. 10.
the high places, and burnt their bones upon the Altar. Elias, when the
Magistrate would not do his duty, in an extraordinary way, killed Baals
Priests; and if the Magistrate also in the New Testament have the sword given
to him of God, for the punishing of evil doers, as Romans 13. 4, 5. that same
Law must now also have force, though in the use of the sword sundry heretics
are here to be distinguished, as 1. seducing heretics, drawing others away,
from the worship of the true God to idolatry, such are not to be pitied by the
Magistrate, as Deuteronomy. 13. 5, 6, 7. Zach. 13. 4, 5, 6. whereas seduced, and
drawn away souls, for simple heresy, cannot be put to death. 2. Heretics
falling away in many particulars from the faith to Popery, or other heretical
ways, are more severely to be punished, then those who are heretics in one or
two fundamental points only. And those who are universal Apostates, and fall
from the Christian faith to Judaisme and Paganism, deserve no less then
death. 3. Selfe-condemned heretics, after sufficient information, and
malicious opposers of the truth, deserve harder dealing, then simply seduced
heretics. 4. All who believe blasphemies to be truth, and hold them, are not
to be reckoned amongst formal blasphemers, whose malice carries them on to
rail upon the unspotted ways of God. 5. No heretics having false opinions of
God, such as Antinomians and Libertines, who think that the regenerate cannot
sin, or that the worshipping of a creature is not idolatry, can be innocent,
as if ^^^mply acts of the judgment and mind not conform to Gods will revealed
in his word were not sins, (as Arminians teach) whereas all the faculties of
the soul are under Gods Law. 2. Hardly does the mind conceive false thoughts
of God, or his worship, but there be wicked crookes in the will and affections
inclining thereunto the mind, and smoking the mind with will-guiltinesse.

6. Except God was too rigorous and cruel in the Old Testament (God avert such
blasphemous thoughts) what ever punishment even to blood and death was
inflicted upon heretics, seducing Prophets, Idolaters, Apostates, these same
stand yet in the plentitude of moral obligation against such as offend in the
New Testament, if the Magistrate bear the Lords sword, as he does in the New
Testament, Romans 13. 4, 5.

Beza says, had no Scripture to say, because Christ is a meek Savior, all
corporal punishment inflicted upon heretics in the Old Testament, is turned
over in spiritual punishment; only our brethren who deny that the Magistrate
can compel any to an external profession of the Gospel, do herein follow
Arminians and Socinians. So the Remonst. in confess. c. 24. Sect. 9. qui

the Catechize of Raccovia teach farther, that the Magistrate may punish by

murderer, because the Commandment of our meek Savior, does not permit to
take away any man's life; now it is certain meek Jesus, while he was on
earth, did neither fine nor imprison, more then put to death. 3. So^inians
teach that all wars under the new Testament are unlawful; for says

Cyprian says to Demetrius that he was greater then his Gods, because he
revenged the wrongs done to his Gods, and that it was a shame for him to hope
for help from the Gods which he behooved to defend.

Answ. This proves that the false Gods of Demetrius were but false Gods,
because they were not able to revenge the wrongs done to themselves, as the
true God, who made the heaven and the earth, can do, but nothing against the
punishing of the Heretics, for then it should follow, that blasphemy against
the holy Ghost, and no sins should be punished, for all sins are injuries
done to God, and therefore neither Magistrates, nor parents, nor doctors, yea
nor the Church should use any rod, either corporal or spiritual, against
subjects, children, or scandalous persons, because God can revenge his own
quarrel; yea excommunication is a revenging of a wrong done to God. 2. They
object the Apostles way was to watch against Heretics, Act. 20. 29. 31. and
Romans 16. 17. to es^hew them, 2 Timothy 2. 25. the servant of the Lord must be
gentle.

Answ. This is objected by (...).

where the Magistrate is armed with authority, he ought to inflict bodily
punishment upon the seducing heretics, so it he done as Augustine cp^st. 47.

object that it is contrary to the meek spirit of Christ in the New Testament,
that any should be punished for heresy, and that it is proper to enemies of
the truth, and Antichrist so to do, as their (...). histori. l. 12. c. 4
practice declare. Nestorius being made Archbishop of Constantinople, said to
the Emperor, I will give thee heaven O Emperor, if thou with free the earth
of heretics; Dioscorus compelled, with armed soldiers, the Bishops to
subseribe to the heresy of Entyches; Eud^xius the Arrian obliged Valens the
Arrian Emperor to root out (...) orthodox professors. The Turk in his Alcoran
commands to kill all who obey not his law.

Answ. The sword is expressly given by God, Romans 13. to Christian Magistrates,
and this is not against the meekness of Christ, no more nor to deliver to
Satan, or to curse and excommunicate Apostats with that great curse called
Anath^ina Maranatha, 1 Cor. 16. 22. And though Heretics and Mahomet teach that
Heretics, as also they teach that manslayers, adulterers, paricides should die
the death, it follows not that we are not to teach the same. Fourthly, The
parable of letting the Tares grow, while the day of judgment is alleged. It
is true Chrysostom. ^om. 47. in Matthew. 13.
Chrysostom says that many innocent persons are killed in the rooting out the
tares by bloody wars; Chrysolog. sermon. 79.
Chrysologus says, Neither Matthew the publican, nor Paul should have been

Erasmus diaboli, the children of the devil, and Theophylact adds, Zizania
sunt h^reses, vel malae cogitationes, and Gerardus perverteth Theophylact, for
he extends the tares not only to Heretics, but also to wicked men, to
Matthew who was a publican, but not a Heretic properly. And first the field is
the world of the visible Church, where the seed of the Word is sown, and it
must be meaned of all scandalous persons in Christ's visible kingdom, so all
shall be spared, and there shall neither be use of the Magistrates sword, nor
of the Church discipline in the Church, as Anabaptists expone the place. 2.
There should Deus non per^ittit haeretico be llis consumi similiter neque
propter mal^s cogitatienes vult Deus exscindi hominem: si Mattheus excisus
esset ex hac vita, cum esset zizanium, simul etiam excisum esset fr^nent^n quod
postea ex ipso erat oriturum.
not so much as rebukes and threatenings been used, but wicked men should be
permitted to grow, while the day of judgment, that the Angels root them out.
Now it is known that the power of the word preached has rooted out some
tares, because it has converted them. 3. Heretics are not all things which
offend; the incestuous Corinthian offended also. 2. Only Heretics are not
such as work iniquity, there be others also in the visible Church, as our
brethren expone, Revel. 22. 15. nor are only heretics to be cast out in the
furnace of fire, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 3. Nor
are only the good wheat those who are orthodox and opposite to heretics, who
shall shine as the Sun in the kingdom of their father, p. 42. 43. except we
would say that all sound in the faith and holding no heretical doctrine shall
shine in the firmament as the Sun. 4. The casting out of Heretics out of the
visible Church by excommunication is a rooting of them out of the field of the
visible Church; Let more of this be seen and considered in those who have
written thereof, as in G^rardus, loc. cit. Beza de puniend. Haeret. Bellarm. de

APPENDIX.
A further consideration of compelling, or tolerating, those of contrary
Religions and Sects in the Church.
We still hold (as is already said) that Christian Magistrates cannot compel
Pagans to embrace the Christian faith. Nor can the Church in a Church Way
compel Pagans or Jews coming to remain amongst us Christians, because
Pagans are to be gathered to a Church, by the preaching of the Word, and by
that way that the Apostles planted Churches, which was by the sword of the
Spirit only, as Matthew. 28. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 2. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6. But the
argument which the Tannerus, 22. ^ 10 7 87.
Jesuit Tannerus, and other Papists bring for it, I judge most weak, for they
will not have them compelled to the faith, because, 1. faith is a voluntary and
free act, 2. because it is a supernatural work of God, and so they are not
under the stroke of the Magistrates sword; for freewill in supernatural acts
is alike uncogible and free from all external violence, in both those who are
baptized professors within the bosom of the visible Church, and in Pagans; and
the truth is, neither the Magistrate nor the Church can censine opinions, even
erroneous in fundamental points, as they are opinions; for no society, no
humane authority can either judge of, or punish the internal acts of the
mind, because as such they are indeed offensive to God, but not offensive or
scandalous to either Church or Commonwealth, and so without the Sphere of all
humane coercive power: nor is Titus, Tit. 1. To rebuke gainesiyers, v. 9. that
they may be sound in the faith, v. 13. but in so far as that faith is
visible, and as it comes out of perverse mouths, which must be stopped, v.
11. Also punishments either civil or ecclesiastical do no other ways work
upon the mind and heart, but by a moral and swasory influence, for it is a
palpable contradiction, that freewil can physically be compelled, and therefore
here (says Phil. Gamachaeus com. in 12. q. 10. c. 3. Non hic opus gladio
imperatoris, sed hamo piscatoris.
Philip Gamacheus) there is no need of an Emperors sword, but of a Fishers
Angle. Let it go then, which is taught as a truth, (a) Quicunque et l.
haeretic^. et l. Manichei God. de haeretic. as Tertullian in Scorpiac. c. 2.
haeetict compelli debent, non alli ci, et duritia vincenda, non suadenda; which
says, that heretics are otherwise to be dealt with then those who never
embraced the Christian faith.
in this point, by Covar^uvias in regula peccat. p. 2. sect. 10
Covarruvias, (e) Gregori. de Valent. Gamacheus loc. cit.
Gamacheus, Tannerus in 22. q. 10. art. 8 Dub. 1.
Tannerus, Malderus de virtut. Theolog. q. 10. art. 8.
Malderus, that Princes have neither from the Law of nature, or from any divine
Law, a coercive power over the faith of Pagans; nor is Scotus in a. did. 4.
Scotus in this to be heard, that the same divine law obliegeth all Princes,
and the Churches, that did lie upon Israel to destroy the Cansanites.

Yet may it be lawful in some cases indirectly to force them, in their false
worship, (as Molina de just. et jure tract. 2. disp. 116.
Molina says against Alphons a Castro de puni^i. baeretic. l. 2. c. 14.
Alphonsus a Castro) if they kill their innocent children to their false Gods,
because it is lawful to defend the innocent; neither is that to be regarded,
as a sufficient reason that these Infants do not consent, that they should be
defended, because as Malderus loc. cit.
Malderus says it is lawful to hinder a man, who is willing to kill himself,
from unjust violence against his own li^. 2. It is lawful as says Coninck.

Cajetanus, to compel Pagans to desist from violent impeding of Pastors to
preach the Gospel to some amongst them, who are willing to hear, because in
that they are injurious to the salvation of those, who are appointed to be
saved, and do manifestly hinder the Gospels progress, which the Church is (so
far as is in her power) to propagate, even as her prayer is, let thy kingdom
come. (d) Greg. de Valent. in 22. q. 10. art. 80. punct 6


2. Nor do we think that Princes may compel Pagans, who are under their
dominions, to the faith, without foregoing information of their conscience, or
that simply they may compel them to embrace the faith; except that here
Princes have greater liberty, indirectly to force them, because they being now
living (as we suppose) in a visible Church, they may infect the Church, and
therefore here should be an indirect hindering of the exercise of their false
religion, in so far as it is infectious to the Church of God, ne pars sincera
trahatur: for to this by a certain proportion the power of excommunication
given to the Church by Christ, may lead us, 1 Cor. 5. 6. and if we must live
by Laws, and not by examples, Extravan. Paul's IIII. decret. l 7. (...). de de
Iudae^s.
Paul the fourth his suffering of the Jews Synagogues at Rome, and their
ancient feasts, which faith Malderus in 12 q. 10. de insidel. cap. 31.

to Christians it is a falling from Christ, and his grace; nor is Cap. qui
sincera. et cap. de Iudaeis did. 45.
Rome who tolerateth Jewith religion, nor the Codt. de Iudaeis.
edict of Honorius and Theodosius our warrant.

3. Nor can we believe, that no other sins, in opinion, concerning God, his
nature, attributes, worship and Church Discipline, (except only such as are
against those points, which are called fundamental, and the received
principles of Christianity) should be censurable by the Church, or punishable
by the Magistrate.

1. Because Jesus Christ, Mat. 18. ordains that every sin against our
brother, or a Church, 1 Cor. 10. 31, 32. in which the delinquent shall
continue, with obstinate refusal to hear the Church, should be censured with
excommunication.

But there be diverse opinions concerning God, his nature, attributes, worship
and Church Discipline, which are not against points fundamental, which being
professed are sins against our brother and the Churches. Ergo, many opinions
not against points fundamental, if professed, are censurable by the Church,
and punishable by the Magistrate. I prove the proposition, because Christ,
Matthew* 18. makes no distinction and exception of any sin, but says
universally, v. 15. (...), if thy brother trespass against thee, etc. and we
can make no exception against an indefinit and Catholic statute, and ordinance
of Jesus Christ. I prove the assumption: because there be many scandalous
points of Arminianisme, Pelagianisme, of Poperic anent Church government,
traditions, the power and ^fficacie of grace, circumci^ion, forbidding of
marriages, and of meats, which are doctrines of devils, coming from such, as
have consciences burnt with an hot Iron, 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2, 3. many points of
Anabaptisme, Antinomianisme, Socinianisme, and of diverse other sects are not
points fundamental, because many (no doubt) are glorified, who lived and
believed in Christ and died ^gnorant of either opinions, either on the one side
or the other, and yet being professed, preached and maintained, especially
wilfully and obstinately, do wonderfully scandalize our brethren and the
Churches. Nor can I say that such as believe that marriage of Churchmen is
unlawful, and defend it, as many holy and learned men in Popery did, and died
in that error, if otherwise they believe in Christ, and the like I say of
Chastising the body, and abstaining from such and such meats, which yet are
doctrines of devils, and offensive to our brethren, 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2, 3. can be
points fundamental, so as the holding of these must be inconsistent with
saving faith. Some do yet maintain that circumcision is lawful, and yet
believe all points fundamental; shall we say, that such are damned? and we
read, Gal. 5. 2. Beh^ld I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing.

2. Opinions in points not fundamental, are either sins forbidden by Gods
Law, or they are not sins; the latter can by no reason be asserted, because
God has in his word determined all controversies not fundamental, as well as
fundamental, therefore it is necessary, necessitate praecepti, by virtue of a
divine precept, that ^ee believe that to be true, what God says in his Word,
therefore the not believing of it must be a sin and a transgression of a
Divine Law. 2. If it be no sin, it must be because the mind is under no Law
of God, except in so far as the mind is ruled and led by the dominion of
free will; but this is Pelagianisme and Arminianisme, and Papists and Pelagians
will needs examine the inclinations, powers, and motions of the soul, which
go before the wills consent, or arise in us without the wills consent, from
all subjection to a Law, that so original sin may be no sin, because (as
P^^agius said) it is not voluntary, and concupiscence, when the will joyneth no
consent to it, is no sin; yea so the unbeleefe and ignorance of fundamental
points, as they remain in the mind, shall be no sin. 3. If this be no
sin, we are not to pray for illumination, to see either the truth on the one
side, nor on the other; and what actions we do according to these opinions,
in things not fundamental, we do them not with any certainty of faith, or
any plerophorie, but blindly, or doubtingly, and so sinfully, which is expressly
condemned, Romans 14. 13. and is expressly against that full assurance of faith,
that we are to have in those very actions, which in their own nature are
indifferent, as is evident, Romans 14. 14. I know and am persuaded by the Lord
Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of it self, ^. 5. Let every one be
fully persuaded in his own mind. 4. If they be not sins, then are none to
be rebuked for these opinions, no more then they are to be excommunicated for
them, and though any err in points not fundamental, they are not to be
rebuked, yea nor to be convinced of them by the light of the word. (2.) If
they be sins, then when they are publicly prosested, they must scandalize
our brother, but there be no sins which scandalize our brother, but they are
susceptible and in capacity to be committed with obstinacy; Every sin sub
ratione scandali, is the subject of Church-censure; Yea I^m. 16. 17. Every one
is to be avoided, who causes divisions, and (...) es contrary to the doctrine
which the Church has learned of the Apostles, and every one who walks
disorderly, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 11. and (...) not the commandment of the Apostles, is
to be excommunicated, (...) he be ashamed, v. 14. but opinions contrary to
the Apostles doctrine in non-fundamentalls, are not fundamentalls, and if they
be professed, cause divisions and offenses contrary to the Apostolik doctrine,
for many non-fundamentalls are the Apostles doctrine.

3. What ever tends to the subversion of fundamentalls, tende^^^^ (...) to
the subversion of faith, and so does much truly scandaliz^an^ bring on
damnation, that Christ has ordained to be removed out of the Church by
Church Censures: but erroneous opinions, in points not fundamental, and in
superstructures, being professed and instilled in the ears and simple minds
of others, tend to the subversion of fundamentalls, as having connection, by
just consequent, with fundamentalls, and do scandalize and bring on doubtings
about the foundation, and so bring damnation. Ergo, erroneous opinions, in
points not fundamental, must be removed out of the Church by Church Censures.
The proposition is clear, he that falls in a public scandalous sin is to
be delivered to Satan, both for his own sake, that he be not damned himself,
but that 1 Cor. 5. 5. to the destruction of the flesh, the spirit may be saved
in the day of the Lord; and so also for others, because a little Leaven
leaveneth the whole lump, v. 6. The assumption is proved by daily experience,
for corruption in Discipline and Government in the Church of Rome, brought on
corruption in Doctrine, and the same did we find in the Churches of Scotland
and England.

4. Fundamentalls are no other thing, then that which the Apostle calls, Heb.
6. 12. (...), the first principles of the oracles of God, and chapter 6. 1. (...),
the Doctrine of the Principles of Christ, which are laid as foundations, as ib.
(...), not laying the foundation again, etc. Then non-fundamentalls must be
such superstructures as are not the first Principles of the Oracles of God, and
are not the Doctrine of the Principles of Christ. But the Apostle will not have
us to fluctuate and doubt as Skeptickes, in a Py^rhonian Vacillation and
Uncertainty, in these, which he calls the superstructures. 1. As is evident
by his words: 11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
but you are dull of hearing. 12. For when, for the time, ye ought to be
teachers, ye have need that one teach you again, which be the first
Principles of the Oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk,
and not of strong food. 13. For every one that uses milk is unskilful in the
word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 14. But strong meat belongs to
them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use, have their senses
exercised to discern both good and evil. Chap. 6. 1. Therefore leaving the
doctrine of the beginning of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying
again the foundation of repentance from dead works, etc. Whence it is more
then evidently apparent to any intelligent mind.

1. That when he says, they ought to be teachers of others, he cannot be
thought to mean that they should teach fundamentalls only to others, because
he would have them to be capable of the food of such as are stronger, and have
their senses exercised to discern good and ill, and will have them carried on
to perction: now fundamentalls are expressly the food of babes which b^^
need of milk, c. 6. v. 12. and not the food of the stronger; if then they
ought to teach superstructures, and non-fundamentalls to others, they cannot
teach and exhort privately, (for of such he speaks) these things whereof they
have no certainty of faith, and which they believe with a reserve, as ready to
reject them to morrow, upon second thoughts, for what we teach to others, those
(as I conceive) we are obliged to speak, because we believe. Psalm. 116. 10. 2
Cor. 4. 13. and those we are to persuade, because we know (not with a reserve,
but with certainty of faith) the terror of the Lord, 2 Cor. 5. 11. If it be
said, teachers now are not obliged to know all that they teach now to be
divine truths, with such a certainty of faith, as Prophets and Apostles, who
were led by an infallible Spirit: for our private exhorting, our public
Sermons come not from a Spirit, as infallible as that Spirit which spoke and
wrote canonick Scripture, for we may err in exhorting, in Preaching, in
writing, but the penmen of canonick Scripture were infallible. I answer, the
penmen of Scripture when they did speak and write Scripture, were infallible.
and de jure, and de facto, they could neither err actually, and by Gods word
they were obliged not to err, and in that they were freer from error, then we
are, who now succeed them to preach and write; but what God has revealed in
his word, whether they be fundamentalls or superstructures, does obliege us to
belief and certainty of faith, no less then it obliegeth the Penmen of
Scripture; and our certainty of saving faith, is as infallible as the faith of
the Prophets and Apostles, except with Papists we say no man can be assured
that he is in the state of grace. If therefore we be obliged to believe all
revealed superstructures, though not fundamental, as the Prophets and Apostles
were, we sin scandalously (when obstinacy is added to ignorance) if we
believe them with such a reserve as is contrary to faith, and because there is
no ignorance of those who teach others, but it is capable of ob^tinacie, and
consequently it is capable of Church censure, Matthew. 18. 17. I grant the weak
and unlearned, though ignorant of their Christian liberty, in that interim, and
case when many things are indifferent, as the case was, Romans 14. though they be
instructed by Paul sufficiently, that nothing is unclean, and that they err
in that, out of an erring consciences light, or rather darkness, they abstain
from such and such meats as Gods law has now made lawful to both Jew and
Gentile, yet are they not to be censured, nor troubled with thorny
disputations, but if these weak ones, 1. persist in their error, and 2. teach
it to others and mislead them, they knowing that they believe these errors with
a reserve, are (as I conceive) false teachers, and censurable by the Church and
State, and not weak, but obstinate.

2. We are not to be dull of hearing, but are to be fully instructed, und
certainly persuaded so of superstructures, which are not the first principles
of the Oracles of God, as that we are to teach others. Ergo, a Pyrrbonian
fluctuation in these, is damnable. How then can it be a principle, next to Gods
word, most to be followed, not to make our present judgment and practice, in
matters not fundamental, a binding Law to us for the future? 2. The Apostle
ought not to rebuke them for being dull of hearing of those things, whereof
either sides may be believed, in a necessary case of syncretisme and
pacification, without any hazard of punishment or Church Censures; for what is
a necessary principle, and to be holden and enacted, as the most sacred Law of
all others, next unto the Word of God, the matter of that principle being
unknown, and neither sides understood, received, or believed, cannot put on
any the rebuke of dull hearing: For example, if the point of Presbyteriall
government of the Church, or of independencie of single congregations, be a
point not to be received, with such certainty of faith and assurance, but we
are to reject either, or both, when we shall receive new light, that they are
false and contrary to the rule of holy Scripture; and again, if we are to
reject the opinion contradicent to these former points of Presbyteriall
government and independent congregations, for there is by this opinion, the
same reason of the contradicent, as of the formerly affirmed opinions; I see
not how I may not be dull of hearing, yea how I may not simply be ignorant of
both and not sin against God. 3. Those superstructures which are not
fundamental, are the strong persons food, as the knowledge of principles
fundamental is the food of babes, verse. 12, 13. Then I must be persuaded of
the truth of them, else they cannot feed my soul with knowledge, because
knowledge of Pyrrhonian fluctuation, which is conjecturall, and may be no less
false then true, and which I must so believe for truth, as possible the tide of
a contrary light may carry me to believe the just contrary as truth, can never
be the strong food of such as are skilled in the word of righteousness. 4. The
knowledge of these superstructures or non-fundamentals belongs to those who
are of full age, and have their senses exercised to discern both good and ill,
verse. 14. and which are carried on to perfection, c. 6. v. 1. having now left
the fundamentals, as food to babes and unskilled, c. 5. v. 12. But I heartily
crave to learn, what perfection doewe arive unto? and what increase of fuller
age, what experience of more spiritual knowledge, perfecting the spiritual
senses, do I attain, to know certain truths, which to me may be no less
rotten conclusions, and mere forgeries of men's brains, then divine truths?
Hence if this Arminian liberty of prophesying, and this perpetual fluctuation
of men always learning, and never coming to the knowledge of the truth; be
contrary to growing in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 2
Pet. 3. 18. and contrary to that which is called, 1 Cor. 1. 5. all knowledge,
and to the abundance of knowledge, which in the last days, is to fill the
earth, as the sea is filled with waters; so that when I have once over-sailed
that point of the coast of the knowledge of fundamental articles, I am now in
a Sea of four contrary winds, and four contrary tides at once, and I know
nothing for truth, but its contradicent may be, yea, and to me is as true, (I
say) if this fluctuation of knowledge be contrary to growing in knowledge, it
must be rejected as a Chimera, and the dream of men's heads.

5. Let us take one point not fundamental, to wit this, (Every congregation
has absolute power of Church government within it self, without subjection to
Classes, Presbyteries, and Synods) You are so persuaded of the truth of this,
that your present judgment and practice is no binding Law to you, for the
morrow; but you leave room in your judgment to believe, to morrow, the
contradicent, when new light shall appear. Well then to morrow, this
non-fundamentall, and this contradicent is now to you true, (No congregation
has absolute power of Church Government within it self, but has its power in
dependence upon, and with subjection unto Classes, Presbyteries, and Synods.)
Well, to morrow is come, and this you believe now to be Gods truth, yet so, as
your present judgment, and practice is no binding Law to you, for the second
morrow, but you leave room for light, which shall appear the second morrow;
well, in the second morrow, new light appears and convinces you, that the
contradicent is true, and you recurre in a circle, to believe your first
proposition again is true, to wit, the contradicent of your second days
proposition, and now to you this is true, as it was once, (Every congregation
has absolute power of Church Government within it self, without subjection to
classes, Presbyteries, and Synods:) Now, on the third morrow, a new light
appearing, you are to believe the contradicent; and because all circular
motions are in credit to be deemed eternal, and your mind is always obliged
to stoop and fall down before new light, and the conscience is to render her
self captive to every emergent truth: what can you here say but there is no
end of fluctuations and doubtings? But you say, Gods spirit, the revealer of
all truth, does not fluctuate, though I change, God Jebovah changes not, he
can reveal no contradictory truths, for one of them must be a lie, and he is
the Lord who cannot lie.

Answ. Then I say, these non-fundamentals are in themselves and intrinsecally
certain, and if God reveal them in his Word, he must reveal them under the
notion of things certain, and we are to believe them as certain truths,
having intrinsecall necessity in themselves from the authority of God the
revealer, therefore I am not to believe them with a fluctuation of mind to
casheere the truth of them, to morrow, and the next, and the third morrow.

But you say, I do believe non-fundamentals as they are revealed, now they are
not revealed to me in the word, in that measure and degree of clearness and
evidence of light, that fundamental points of faith are revealed, therefore I
may lawfully believe these non-fundamentals, which are less evidently
revealed, with a reserve, that, upon the supposall, I see I had an error of
judgment in taking them to be truths, whereas now I see them to be untruths, I
do renounce them; but because fundamentals are clearly revealed, I am to
believe them, without any reserve at all.

Answ. The degrees of revelation and proposals of truths to our minds, less or
more, evident, or less evident, so they be revealed by God, in a sufficient
measure of evidence, they free us from obligation of faith, in tanto, non in
toto, as is clear, John 15. 22. If I had not come to them, they should not
have had sin, the sin of unbelief, and in such a measure; yet if God reveal
these non-fundamentals, though not so perspicuously as he reveals
fundamentals, we are obliged to know them and believe them with certainty of
faith, and upon this formal reason, because Jehovah speaks them in his word,
no less then we are obliged to know and believe fundamentals: for our dullness
and blindness of mind does not license us to believe what God reveals to us in
his Word with an (...) and a fluctuation of mind, no more then the natural man
is licenced to believe the fundamentals of the Gospel with doubting, because
they come in under the capacity of his understanding, as foolishness, 1 Cor.
2. 14. But, say you, upon supposall that our darkened hearts do not see these
non-fundamentals clearly, we are obliged to take their meaning and sense, with
a reserve, and so to receive and entertain the truths of these
non-fundamentals, as we leave room, upon supposall of our misapprehensions, to
retract our judgment, and to believe the contrary of what we once believed,
and this bindereth not but that we are simply and absolutely obliged to believe
the non-fundamentalls.

Answ, If we be simply and absolutely obliged to believe non-fundamentals,
though they be not so clearly revealed to us as the fundamentals, as no doubt
we are, then do we contrary to the moral obligation of a divine precept, and
so sin in believing, with a doubting and hesitation, of that which God has
revealed in his word: and when we believe Gods truth with a reserve to retract
our judgment, when a clear light shall make naked to us our error, that
revealed error, if revealed to be an error, by the Lord speaking in his word,
does clearly evince that God never revealed, nor meant to reveal in his Word,
the former truth that was believed with a reserve, for God cannot reveal
things contradictory, and out of the mouth of the Lord comes no untruth:
therefore God in these non-fundamentals reveals to us but one thing to be
believed, and that absolutely without all reserves, for God can no more shine
with a new light, to delare the contradicent of what he has once revealed as
truth, then he candeny himself, or lie; which to assert were high blasphemy:
and if the first truth of the non-fundamentall do only appear truth to our
understanding, and be no such thing, but in it self an untruth, then does the
God of truth reveal no such thing. 2. Upon supposall that we see not the truth
of these non-fundamentals clearly, we are neither to believe with a reserve,
nor to believe them absolutely, nor yet are we to suspend our belief, because
I conceive all the three to be sinful, and we are never obliged to sin, but
we are obliged to know and believe simply without all reserve, having laid away
our dark and confused conscience, and are to know clearly and believe firmly
that God speaks this, not this in his Word; nor, because I do fluctuate
about the truth of these non-fundamentals, am I obliged to follow in
non-fundamentals the endictment of a fluctuating conscience, seeing holding the
plenitude and plenary perfection of Gods Word, the Lord has no less
manifested his will, in setting down superstructures and non-fundamentals, in
his Word, then he has revealed his mind to us in fundamentals.

But our Brethren prove that we may tolerate one another in diverse and
contrary opinions about non-fundamentals, from Phil. 3. 15. Let us therefore,
as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise
minded, God shall reveal this unto you. 16. Nevertheless, whereunto we have
already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
Now there is nothing more opposite to this rule, then the practices of some,
who will exclude and allow communion in nothing, where there is difference in
anything. The labors of Davenant and others in this needful case of
syncretisme and pacification in those times are very seasonable.

I answer, I distinguish three things that may be judged the object of
syncretisme or mutual toleration. 1. Fundamentalia, fundamental points. 2.
Supra and circa fundamentalia, things that are builded on the foundation or
superstructures, or things about the foundation, as many positive and
historical things that cannot result by good consequence off, or from the
foundation, as that there were eight souls in Noah's Arc, and some rituals of
Gods institution in the Sacrament of the Supper and Baptism, etc. 3. Praeter
fundamentalia, things merely physical, not moral, having no influence in
Gods worship at all; as such a day for meeting of an Assembly of the Church,
Wednesday rather then Thursday; a cloak when you pray in private, rather then
a gown; these have, or contribute of themselves no moral influence to the
action, as in what corner of your Chamber you pray in private, these are
merely indifferent, and tolerance in these I would commend. It is true, there
is a strict connection often betwixt the physical and the moral circumstances,
so as the physical circumstance does put on, by some necessity, a moral
habitude and respect, and then the physical circumstance becomes moral, as
in what corner of your Chamber you pray, it is merely physical and
indifferent, but if that corner that you pray in, cast you obvious to the eyes
of those who are walking in the streets, that they may see and hear your
private prayers, then the place puts on the moral respect of a savor of
some Pharisaicall ostentation, that you pray to be seen of men; and so the
circumstance now is moral, and is to be regulated by the Word, whereas the
circumstance that is merely physical is not, as it is such, in any capacity
to receive scripturall regulation, nothing is required but a physical
convenience for the action. Now for fundamental superstructures, for things
about the foundation, in so far as they have warrant in the Word, to me they
oblige to faith and practices, in so far as the Lord intimates to us in his
Word, either expressly, or by good consequence, that they are lawful. Now I
may add to these, that there be some things adjacent, circumvenient,
circumstantiall to these fundamentals, superstructions, and others that I
named, wherein mutual tolerance is commendable; Nor do we think any Church
Reformation so perfect as that reformers have not left it in some capacity more
or less of receiving increase and latitude of Reformation; but truly I do
not see the consequence, that therefore in all points not fundamental the
conscience must be of that compliable latitude of Kid-leather to take in, and
let out, so as none of these superstructures or non-fundamentals are to be
believed but with a reserve, that you take them to day as Gods truths, and are
in capacity to believe their contradicents to be Gods truth to morrow.

And for the place, Phil. 3. 14. 15. The sense given by Zanchius pleases me.
We that are reputed perfect, let us all think and mind this truth that I write,
to contend for the price of the high-calling of God; and if any mind any other
thing contrary to, or diverse from my doctrine, God in his own time shall
reveal it to him. Zanchius says, Deus id quoque revelabit suo tempore, nempe
an falsum Zanch. com. in Phil. 3.
sit vel verum. God shall reveal it to him in his own time, whether it be
true or false: to which part I do not subscribe; that God shall reveal to any
other minded then Paul, whether his doctrine be true or false, for that may
infer a possibility that Paul taught in this point, or in the matter of
ceremonies, something false: but the meaning is, God shall make him know by the
revelation of truth, that what I have taught is true; and he adds as
Zanchius, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, S^lmeron, yea our own Calvine, Marlorat,
and others, upon this condition, that they walk with us in peace and concord,
according to the (...) the Gospel: and that these words are a condition, I
believe, because Christ says, John 7. 17. If any man will do his will, he
shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my
self. But I see nothing here that reaches the conclusion that we deny; it
will bear this indeed, if any man be otherwise minded, and think that Paul
has not delivered sound doctrine, either concerning our pressing forward
toward the prise of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ, or concerning
ceremonies; that is, if any man believe untruths contrary to Paul's doctrine,
let him believe these untruths, leaving room to Gods light, to bow down under
truths feet, when God shall reveal that Paul's doctrine is true, and that his
thoughts diverse from Paul's doctrine was misapprehensions and errors; but
there is nothing here, that if any believe true non-fundamentals, he is to
believe them with a reserve, that if God, with a new light, shall appear, to
discover these truths to be untruths, he shall change his mind. Now the
supposition is vain, and as unpossible, as to say, God can contradict and
belie his own truth, nor is there any word of toleration of Sects in the text.
Yea, but (say they) Paul professes to walk according to the rule to which
they (...) all attained, with those who are contrary minded. Ergo, we are to
tolerate and to keep peaceable communion with those who are contrary minded in
opinions, and disagree from us.

Answ. Mark, I pray you, that Paul does not say he will walk with them, and
keep communion with them simply; but only, 1. while God shall reveal their
error, and by his light make them see that Paul's doctrine is true. 2. So in
other things, they be of one mind with Paul, as perfect men should be: and so
I think Paul does indeed condemn separation and breach of love for diversity
of opinions in some things; and we doubt not, but if the servant of the Lord
should with gentleness instruct malicious opposers of the truth, and wait on
them to see, if God, peradventure, will give them repentance, to the
acknowledgment of the truth, 2 Timothy 2. 24, 25. far rather should Paul walk
with those that are perfect according to the same rule, though they be of
another mind; but it follows not that those who are of another mind from
Paul, should, 1 obstinately continue in that mind, after that God has by
writings and dispute convinced them of their error. 2. It follows not that
their ob^tinate continuance in their error should always be tolerated, and
never censured, especially if it be such an error as causes divisions and
offenses, Romans 16. 17. for then such should be avoided, says Paul, in that
same place. 3. It follows not that we are to believe no superstructures or
non-fundamentals, but with a reserve: it is observable that Paul speaks here
of those who believe errors and doctrines contrary to Paul's doctrine; Now
consider then the force of the argument, those who believe errors contrary to
Paul's doctrine, have no certainty of faith, that what they believe is true, and
therefore must believe with a reserve, leaving room to new light; therefore
those who believe any true superstructures and any non-fundamentals, have also
no certainty of faith, but must believe with a reserve, that when light shall
appear, they shall believe the contradicent of what they now believe, there is
no force in this connection. It is just like the question betwixt us and the
Papists, whether a man can be certain with any divine and infallible certainty
that he is in the state of grace and salvation. Papists say hypocrites believe
that they are in the state of grace, and yet they have no certainty thereof,
Ergo, (say they) the regenerate believing that they are in the state of grace,
can have no certainty. This is a very ill consequence, for a sleeping man is
not certain whether he be dreaming or waking. Ergo, a waking man knows not
whether he be waking, or not. So a distracted man has no certainty that he is
as wise as seven men who can render a reason; therefore a man sober in his wits
knows not that he is in his sober wits: these be poor and loose
consequences. It is true, when we believe some alterable circumstances of some
things rather about, then in doctrine and discipline, which are disputable, and
to us both sides have great probability, we have not certainty of faith, and
possible here in our opinions learned and holy men; yea and whole Churches may
look beside their book, and be deceived; and these we take not to be the
subject of a sworn confession of faith, and here we grant a [non liquet] on
both sides, and do allow some grain weights of reserve to persons and
Churches, to retract in those things: but hence it is badly concluded that we
believe these non-fundamentals of discipline, for which we have certainty of
evidence from Gods Word, with a reserve, and with a loosnesse of assent and
credulity to believe the contrary to morrow; for so the same argument should
militate against the certainty of faith in some fundamentals: for a person, yea
any particular Church may err in denying the resurrection of the dead, as some
did in the Church of Corinth; and Christ's Disciples, though true believers,
doubted of his rising from the dead, John 20. 9. Peter and the disciples
doubted of Christ dying for the losed world, Mat. 16. 21, 22. Luke 24. 25, 26.
and because any true believer may fall in that temptation and weakness, as to
deny all the articles of faith, taken divisively, for they may deny this or
this article fundamental, (though I do not think a regenerated person can
deny the whole systeme and body of fundamentals collectively) it shall follow
by this argument that regenerated persons and particular Churches are to
believe some fundamentals with a reserve, and keeping room for light to
believe the contrary, and so if this argument be good, we have no certainty of
faith in believing any one fundamental article its alone. Nor can Nathan or
Samuel have certainty of faith in believing their own prophecies flowing from
the immediate inspiration of the Spirit; but they are to believe them with a
capacity to receive the faith of the contradicent prophecies, because Nathan
had no certainty of faith in commanding David to build the Temple; and Samuel
had as little certainty in pronouncing Eliah to be the Lords anointed.

Another doubt against this is, That if any, out of weakness and mere
tenderness of conscience, deny some superstructures, which are indeed
scripturall truths, they are not to be counted heretics, because out of
weakness, not out of obstinacy they err, nor to be censured with
excommunication or censures of Church or Magistrate, and therefore in these we
are to believe truths, with a reserve, and to tolerate the contrary minded, if
they agree with us in fundamentals.

Answ. That this may be answered, 1. The object of these opinions would be
distinguished. 2. The persons, weak or strong. 3. The manner of refusing
instruction, or of admitting light, of mere weakness, or of obstinacy. For
the first, if the matter be faultlesse or light, as eating meats or not eating
meats, in time when they are merely indifferent, and the person weak and
scarce capable of disputation, he is to be tolerated, and not received into
knotty and thorny disputations, about things indifferent: for so Paul Romans 14.
is to be understood, when he will not have the weak taken in (...): so Michael
strove with the Angel disputing, (...): if the matter concern an institution
of Christ, and our necessary practice in a Church, and the party be not weak.
It is a question what makes obstinacy, and what tenderness and weakness,
Turrecrema. qui paratus est tenere contrarium, li. 4 sum. de eccle. p. 2. c. 17.
Turrecremata says, he who is ready to yield to light, is not obstinate,
Scotus ignorantia crassa, 4 d. 22. ar. 3.
Scotus, gross ignorance, Canus l. 12. de loc. c. 12. affectata ignoran. facit
pertinacem.
Canus says, affected ignorance makes obstinacy, Malderus crassa ignorantia
relinquit ho^ninem paratum obedire ecclesia idecque non exclude^et objectum
formale fidei. de virtut. Theol. in 22. de haeres. q. 11. ad 2. men 1. 4.
Malderus says that gross ignorance may leave a man ready to yield to the
information of the Church, A Cost^o de punitio hare^. li. 1. c. 9.
Alphonsus a Castro says better, he is obstinate who 1. defends an opinion
against the Scripture, or, says he, (which is his error) against the
definition of a general Council, or of the Pope. 2. Who being admonished does
not amend. 3. Who seeks not resolution from the learned, with a purpose to
render himself truths captive. 4. Who swears that he shall adhere to the
end, to that opinion. By the light and knowledge of the holder of the opinion,
it may be collected whether he seeks truth, and is ready to yield himself
and his understanding thereunto: and except the point be fundamental, it can
hardly be judged heresy: if the point may be holden without any scandal, or
breach of peace, much tolerance is required where error seems to be a
temptation to holy men, but final tolerance, and unlimitted, where the party
is of great knowledge, and has sway in the minds of many, to prevail to draw
others after him, is harder.

Object. But he that serves God in these is acceptable to God, Romans 14. 18.
and if a man judge some doctrine to be error, though it be no error, yet to
him that so judges it is error; if he suffer death for that he judges
truth, he suffers for righteousness, being truth in his judgment, and
therefore liberty of conscience is to be given to all sects; Christ would not
forbid a man that preached in his name, to preach, though he did not follow
him, Mark. 9. 38. Luke 9. 50. The best way to hinder Sects is to re^ute them by
the Scriptures, and not to set decrees of Synods to others, because that is
done already by Christ and his Apostles; for Gods judgment shall still be on
you, while you establish Christ's Jubilee, and freedom of consciences, Luke 4.
18.

Answ. Let none think that these be the words of our brethren, but of a
certain Anabaptist, and of Arminians and Socinians who object the same; for
Paul, Romans 14. 18. he that serves God, (...), is to be understood (as the
context teaches us) that is, that they relate the words going before, v. 17.
he who serves God in righteousness, in peace, in joy of the holy Ghost, the
meaning is not that he is acceptable who serves God in following the
indictment of his light and conscience, because it is his conscience, for then
some should please God in sinning against God. But it is a point worthy our
consideration, what tie and obligation an erroneous conscience lays on men:
hence with correction these considerations.

1. The true cause why an erring conscience obliegeth to abstinence from the
fact in the case of error and misrepresentation of conscience, is, 1. Because
conscience is the nearest divine principle of our moral actions, and stands
in the room of God, and therefore he who does any thing against the very
erroneous ditement of conscience, is hence convinced to have a perverse will to
sin against the majesty of God, because he who should believe usury to be
theft, (though we should suppose with Calvin and other great Divines usurie to
be in some cases lawful) should yet take usury, has a the^teous will in
that, and does steal. 2. Because the oblieging Law of God is not applied to
our actions at all, but by the interveening actual use of our conscience; see
Pirerius com in Romans 14 v. 14 disp. 2.
Pirerius.

2. Consideration In the question, whether an erroneous conscience does obliege
a man, or no. It is taken for a thing out of controversy, yea that this is no
question at all, Whether or no does an erroneous conscience so bind, that we
can do nothing against the standing enditement of an erring conscience: for
the Scripture is clear in this, Romans 14. 14. I know and am persuaded by the
Lord Jesus, that there is nothing (of meat-kind now under the Gospel) unclean
(or unlawful to eat) of it self, but to him that esteems any thing to be
unclean, (in the light of his il-informed and erroneous conscience) to him (so
thinking) it is unclean, that is, to this man now under the actual darkness
and error of an ill-informed conscience it is not lawful to eat, but he must
abstain from eating, not simply from eating, but from eating, ^^li modo: So
all who have commented on the place, Calvin, Beza, Par^us, Rollocus, etc. and
of the Fathers, all who either commented on, or handled the text occasionally,
as Theodoret, Chrysostom, Basilius, Augustine, Cyprian, Ambrose, Origin,
Anselm, all the Popish writers, Lyra, Hugo Cardinalis, Aquinas, Toletus,
Pirerius, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, etc. yea Adrianus quolib. 2. punct. 3 ad.
5.
Adrianus, Vasquez in 22. q. 19. ar. 5, 6. disp. 59. c. 2.
Vasquez, Pezantius ib. disp. 2.
Pezantius, say it is manifestly against the Scripture, and heretical to say,
it is no sin to do contrary to the commandment or prohibition of an erring
conscience.

3. Hence the conscience carries to the agent from God a twofold obligation
most considerable here; 1. one from the action it self to be done, or not
done; and this comes wholly from the oblieging Law of God, and not from the
conscience: there is another obligation that consists not in the action, and
comes not from the action, but in the manner of doing, and this obligation
comes from conscience it self, and that is that we do nothing, in such a
manner, that is against the light or indictment of our conscience: for this is
an imbred Rose and Flower of divinifie and majesty that grows kindly out of
conscience according to that high place of some sort of royalty, that it has
to be something of God, a little breast-God, a little Deputy and Judge not to
be contemned; so when a proconsull brings to me a forged commandment from
my Sovereign and Prince, I may receive it with non-obedience, if I know it to
be a forgery, but I am not to despise and put any note of disgrace upon the
proconsull, be cause he is in respect of his office the deputy of my
Sovereign, though in this particular mandat, he does prevaricate, and not
represent the sovereign power and Prince, whose deputy otherwise he is, by
virtue of his office; so is this the deputed royalty of conscience, that it
standing to me, bic and nunc, as representing a message from God, though it
represent it falsely, that I can do nothing in the contrary, that deputry and
message standing actually in vigor.

4. I desire that these two obligations of conscience be carefully kept in
mind; hence I say, that conscience carrying the former obligation of Gods Law,
from which formally the action has its lawfulness, and in an eccentrick and
irregular discrepance from which, it has its unlawfulness, it does not
obliege me to the action, because it is conscience simply; for when it
offers an action to me as lawful, which in very deed, and a part rei, in
it self is unlawful, I am not obliged to that unlawful action: for as God
has given to no ruler made of clay, any royal power to be a tyrant and to
destroy, where as his office is as a father to save and govern; so has not
God given to conscience any power to obliege me to sins; yea and conscience
remains conscience, when it represents forged and illegal mandates under
the notion of things good, even when men love to go to hell by reason, yet in
that false representation conscience is not Gods deputy; therefore though if a
man judge some doctrines to be errors, though they be in themselves truths,
to him that so judges they are errors, yet are these truths not to be
rejected simpliciter and absolutely, by him who judges so, any they are to be
rejected (...), in some respect as they come in under the notion and garments
of errors; and also, if any suffer death for an error which in conscience he
conceives to be truth, that error is to him truth. Distinguo: it is to him
truth, that is; he conceives and dreameth that it is truth; that is most true:
but to him it is truth, that is, it ought to be believed by him as truth, and
practiced as lawful; that is most false: for it ought to be rejected both in
point of belief, and in point of practice, and the erroneous opinion thereof
should be rejected, and therefore if he receive it as truth, and profess it,
and die for it, he dies not for righteousness sake, but he dies for
error, and for the dreams of his own head, and so is not blessed as one who
dveth for righteousness; for this vain reason says, 1. that it is no sin
for the mind to believe a lie, to be a divine truth: and it is righteousness
upon the belief, whereby I believe a lie to be a truth, to suffer for a lie
under the notion of a truth. Both these are false: the former is false, for the
mind is under Gods oblieging Law to conceive aright of all divine truths, as
all the faculties of the soul are under a Law.

2. The latter is false, for to believe lies as divine truths, and suffer for
them, because the erring conscience says they are divine truths, is not
righteousness, but sinful credulity, and blind zeal. 1. Because we are not
to believe what our conscience dictateth as truth, under this formal
reduplication, because our conscience thus does dictate, and says it is truth,
but because Gods spirit says to our conscience, it is a divine truth; not
because our own spirit and our own dreaming and mis^ed conscience says so.
This is the controversy betwixt us and Papists, anent the authority of Gods
Word, but with a little change, for our conscience or the testimony of our
conscience as such, is no more the formal object of our faith, and the formal
medium and reason why with a divine faith I believe a divine truth to be a
divine truth, then the testimony of the Church or the Pope is the formal
reason of my faith; so An ^baptists make a Pope and an infallible spirit of
their own conscience: but the whole formal obligation tying me to receive
this, and this point as a divine truth, is because God has revealed it in his
Word; the consciences representing of it is but a necessary condition of my
believing, but not the formal object of my believing: the conscience is the
cause why I believe it, tali modo, after a rational way, and by the evidence
of practical reason, but it is not the formal cause why I believe it
simpliciter; for Papists, Arrians, Macedonians, and the most detestable
Heretics have consciences representing to them fundamental truths, as lies
and untruths, and have died for these lies, did they suffer for righteousness
for that? and yet to their judgment that which they suffered for was truth.
All the legal obligation is here from Gods Law, not from our conscience.
Arminians, Socinians, Anabaptists imagine that our conscience is the nearest
rule of our actions, which is most false; our present judgment is never a
binding Law to us for the time to come, no not when we believe fundamentalls;
Gods Word, because it is Gods Word, is a binding Law only; our judgment is
regula regulata, and not regula regulans, to be led, and not a leading or
binding Law to us; for conscience, because conscience, is no more a Pope to us,
then the dictates of the Bishop of Rome speaking out of his chair, can
captivate the conscience of any man; and Malderus Malderus (...). T^co^. q. 19
art. 5 9. disp. 84.
holds that our opinion is a Law, according to Ambros. l. de paradis. c. 8.
Ambrose, and he corrects himself, and says our opinion or conscience (non
tam legem esse, quam legis quaddam praeconium, promulgationem, insinuationem)
is not so much the Law of God, as the promulgation of Gods Law: but he adds,
(which makes the business as bad) and says, promulgatio legis recte dicitur
obligare; but the truth is, the promulgation of the Law does not obliege, for
who can say that the Law has an oblieging power from the Herald his act of
proclaiming, reading or declaring the Law? the promulgation of the Law is an
approximation of it to the understanding of the people, but the Law of man has
its oblieging power from the honesty of the matter of the Law, and it has its
obligation to punishment not from the Herald, but from the authority of the
Lawgiver. And our conscience does only promulgate Gods oblie^ing Law, but it
lays not on us the oblieging power, except we speak of an oblieging power
in the manner of receiving and believing the Law of God, that is, (as I said)
that we receive not as a truth what God proposes as an untruth, or that we
receive not as a lie, what God proposes as spoken by himself, for that is to
receive truths against the light of our conscience. And when Ambrose calls
our opinion an obliging Law, he speaks (as Augustine often does) of the Law
of nature, which is that habitual opinion natural that we have of right and
wrong, or of the ^aw written in our heart. I would not here distinguish betwixt
(recta ratio) right reason, and (vera ratio) true reason, for some make right
reason the nearest rule of our actions, so as the action is lawful, it our
conscience persuade to it, though the action swa^ve and decline from Gods Law,
For to me reason is never right which is not true and agreeable to Gods Law.
It is objected, if one shall believe it is lawful to kill a protestant King,
because it is good service in God, to kill a heretic; (as there be good store
of consciences of this metal amongst the nation of Jesui^es) if he kill him
not be sins against God, because be sins against the light of his
conscience by the sinful omitting of good service to God, and if be kill him
(...) sins also in committing murder, both against the sixth Commandment,
and also against the fist, which commands to honor Kings* out of which it
must follow that either an erring conscience, because it is conscience,
obliegeth us to do that, which because we do it, in obedience to an erring
consceence, now leaves off to be sin to the actor under this condition of
conscience; or then that there may be such a perplexity wherein a man by way
of contradiction, whether he do such ^n all, or do it not, is necessitated
by Gods providence to sin, which absurdity shall make God the author of sin.

Answ. There is no necessity by way of contradiction, that a man thus
perplexed must sin, whether he do or not do such anaction: for I give
easily a third case different from both, for such a perplexed Jesuit is
neither obliged to kill the Prince, nor yet to abstain from killing in such a
perplexed manner; but he is obliged not to kill the Lords anointed, tali
modo: he is obliged to abstinence, but not to abstinence tali modo, such a
way, for he is obliged to lay aside his erroneous and heretical conscience,
and so to abstain from killing with a well informed conscience: for no man is
brought under a lawful perplexity to sin, but men may bring themselves
under sinful perplexities of conscience, which is not to be fathered upon the
holy Lord, who hates sin with a perfect hatred.

I answer to the places, Mark. 9. 30. and Luke 9. they be manifestly corrupted,
for the man who cast out devils in Christ's name, and followed not Christ, was
not a man who followed the light of an erroneous conscience, who thought it
service to God to cast out devils in Christ's name, and not to follow Christ;
for he was not obliged to follow Christ as the Disciples followed him, except
he had had the same command to follow Christ that the Apostles had, which we
read not of; nay it is most like if it had been the error of his conscience
not to follow Christ, then should Christ have rebuked it, but Christ did not
rebuke it in the man, but directly insinuates, v. 40. that the man was with
Christ, and a spiritual follower of Christ, though he did not in such a
bodily way follow Christ, as did Judas and the eleven; and it was the fault of
the Disciples to tie all the duties of a Disciple, casting out devils in
Christ's name, to a bodily following of Christ, which was their pride.

3. It is a good way, to refute sects, and erroneous opinions by Scriptures,
and so is it a good way to convince an incestuous man of the heinousness of
his sin by Scriptures, and to convince Hymeneus and Alexander of their
blasphemous opinions by Scripture, for Scripture lays open the vildnesse of
sins and here^es: but it does not follow, therefore it is not also a good way
to deliver incestuous persons, and blasphemets to Satan, that the spirit may
be saved in the day of the Lord, and that they may learn not to blaspheme, 1
Cor. 5. 5. 1 Timothy 1. 5. Preaching of the Word is one mean to bear down sects
and erroneous opinions, but it takes not away, but establishes
Church Discipline as another mean, and the one is subordinate to the other: if
Matthew. 18. an offending brother can be convinced and brought to repentance by
the power of the Word (as all rebukes must be from the Word) it is good, but
if he remain obstinate in his offense, Christ will have the man
excommunicated, and esteemed a Heatben and a Public^n.

4. It is a vain thing to say that God has refuted all here^^s in the Word,
and therefore there is no need of Synods to refute them, and to make
determinations on the contrary, for it was certain that the Word of God had
refuted the necessity of circum^ision and of observing Moses his Law, as
Peter, James, Paul, Act. 15. do strongly prove from the Word of God and the
word of God condemned the eating of things strang^^^, and of things sacrificed
to Idols in the case of scandal; therefore none of sound judgment will
infer that the determination of a Synod, such as is Act. 15. 22. is not
necessary; yea because the books of Moses condemned the Sadduces in their
Epicurith opinion of denying the resurrection of the dead, I hope it is not for
that superfluous for Christ out of Moses his writings to determine and prove,
Matthew. 22. that the dead must ^i^c again; you may by as good reason say,
nothing should be determined in preaching, nor in writings, because all these
are already determined in the Word, by the Lord, his Prophets and Apostles:
this shall close evert all ministry, (as S^inians do) especially now after
the cannon of the Scripture is closed, for they use the same very arguments
against the necessity of a ministry, because now the Gospel is fully
revealed, there is no necessity of a sent ministry, as was in the Apostles
time: so teach Andr. Raddeccius in ne^s ad l^brun Smiplec^^ page 3. and in
defens. tract de ^^ sfi. page 140.

Smalcius, and R^mons^r. in Ap lo^ ^ 21. s l 226. 2 7. and 246 and Fpis^^p^us
disp 28. these. n.
the Arminians.

And lastly, it is a vild abusing of Scripture to say that the accept th^e
year of the Lord, of which Christ speaks, Luke 4. 18, 1^. is that Jubilee
year of liberty of conscience to all sects of Papists, Arminians, Socinians,
Anabaptists, etc. 1. Because a liberty of heretical and blasphemous opinions
of God, his nature, worship, and Word, cannot be the acceptable year of the
Lord which Christ as Mediator came to proclaim, Esa. 61 2. 5. for that is
license, not liberty; Christ's acceptable year, Fsiy 61. is the spiritual
Jubilee of remission of sins, and eternal redemption proffered in the
Gospel, and really bestowed upon the meek, the broken hearted, the captives,
the prisoners, the mourne^s in Zi^n, and those whom Christ is sent to comfort,
and to clothe with the garments of praise; but he is not sent to comfort
Macedonians, Sabellians, papists, Socinians, etc. because they are Sectaries,
and do adhere to their rotten and false grounds of divinity; for then
liberty of conscience should have been a mercy purchased by Christ's death,
and Arius should obtain by Christ's death a power to be an Arian, and to deny
the divinity of Jesus Christ. 2. In the Hebrew (...) ultio, a revenging, is an
allusion to (...) naeham, consolatus est, for this year was to the believers
Nechama, or consolation, and to unbeleevers Nekama, a revenge or a vengeance,
which cannot sort with sectaries. 3. The acceptable year is as Paul expounds
it, 2 Cor. 6. 2. the acceptable time of the Gospel, and the day of salvation,
and as Hugo Cardinalis com. in Esa 6.
Hugo Cardinalis expounds it well, the time of the fullness of grace under
the Gospel, and that which is called, Esaias 49. 8. the day of salvation, (...)
ratson, the day of good will; and so Beda in locum.

and the Jesuit Salmeron and Gloss. ordin. annum placabilem, id est, fidem and

Glossa Ordinaria expounds it faith and salvation, Procopius in ^arnationis

damnatio^^s Roman^s.
Hieronymus expounds the day of vengeance opposite thereunto, to be the day
of damnation; and Lyra, annus dominicae passionis in quo placa^^s est gene^i
(...).
Lyra the year of Christ's suffering, in which Christ is pleased with mankind.

Quest. III. Whether the Jesuited Lysimachus Nicanor, and the Author of the
Survey of Discipline, does with good reason impute ^^ the Church Government of
the reformed Churches, the eversion of the (...) Magistrates power ^n matters
ecclesiastical?

There came to the light of day, a night-peece of darkness, Anno 1640. A
Pamphlet by one Lysimachus Nicanor, acting the person of a ^esuite, but better
resembling ^ is nature, against our blessed Reformation, imputing to us Treason
to Kings, as the Popish author of the Survey had led the poor man: Survey of
discipl. c. 2^ 23
both of these, as Jesuits, do rail against Calvin, Beza, and the
Geneva-discipline, as Becanus, Suarez, Uasquez, Bellarmine, Gre^serus, and
other their Doctors and teachers do lead them. That I may add to what I have
said before, I desire the reader to eye and consider these distinctions.

1. Far^us com in Romans c. 13. dub. 5. in appendic ad fol. arg resp. 1.
Paraeus teaches that there is a double Church Power, one internal and
proper, as to preach, hind, and loose, to administrate the Sacraments, etc.
This is not in the Prince: and there is another improper and external, which
is exercised about Church Matters, and Church Officers: and this distinction is
grounded upon that saying of Constantine the Emperor to the Bishops, as
Puschius l 4 c. 24. de ^ita Constantin^, ^es istis episcopi in ecclesia, ego
extra ecclesiam seu ^emplum a deo s^^n constitutus.
Eusebius relates it.

2. An external power about matters ecclesiasticke is threefold.

1. A power of order and jurisdiction about the external, or rather in the
external acts of the Church, which are visible and incurreth in the (...), as
to preach, baptize, and these, (as says that learned and Gul Apollo (...).
Vedelium de Episco. constan. c 2. nu. 2.
worthy preacher at Middleburgh, Guliel. Apollonii) do properly pertain to
the spiritual and proper Church Government, and without controversy do not
belong to the Prince.

2. A power external about Church Matters, which is objective, in respect of
the object, sacred or ecclesiastic, but improperly, and by a (...) enely
ecclesiasticke, and essentially and in it self politic, such as we hold to be
the Magistrates power in causing Churchmen do their duty in preaching sound
doctrine, and administrating the Sacraments, ^cording to Christ's institution,
and punishing heretics and false teachers.

3. Some have devised a mixed power ecclesiastic, (as Henric. Salcobrigiens.
p. 121.
Salcobrigiensis) whereby the Prince is the head of the Church, and has a
nomotheticke, and legislative power, in things ecclesiastical: and this is not
only objective in respect of the object ecclesiastical, but also subjective
in respect of the subject, ecclesiastical, in respect that the Prince by
virtue of his civil office, as a King may ordain Prelates, and make Laws in
Church Matters.

Distinction. 3. There is a twofold power in a King, one in a King as a King,
this is alike in all, and ordinary, regal, coactive; whether the King be a
Heathen, a Turk, or a sound believing Christian. There is another power in a
King, as such a King, either a King and a Prophet also, or as a Prophetical
King: and this extraordinary power was in Solomon and David, to write Canonicke
Scripture, and to prophecy, and is not properly a Kingly power: or there is in
a King as such a King, even as a Christian believing King, an other power
ordinary indeed, but it is not a new regal power, but potestas executiva, a
power or a gracious hability to execute the Kingly power that he had before as
a King; so Christianity adds no new Kingly power to a King, but only adds
a Christian power to use, enlarge, and dilate the Kingly power, that he had
before.

Distinction 4. The Magistrate as a Magistrate is a politic head and ruler of
the Commonwealth, but as a Christian he is a member of the Church.

5. The Kings power as King in things ecclesiasticke, is not servi^e and
merely executive, as the Churches servant, to put their decrees in execution,
but it is regal, princely and supreme.

6. The object of the Kings power is not simply a peaceable life, and external
peace of humane societies, but also honesty and godliness, but to be procured
by a civil, politic, regal and coactive way, by the Sword of the secular
arm, as the object of the Church power is honesty and godliness to be
procured by a ministerial, ecclesiastical, and spiritual power, without any
forcing of men by external power.

7. The end of Kingly power, de jure, by Gods right and divine Law,
exintentione Dei approbativa, is godliness, but the end of Kingly power
according to its essence, and de facto, is a quiet life, though it attain not
Godliness, as it does not attain that end, nor can it attain it, amongst
Pagans, and yet there is a Kingly power in its essence, whole and entire
amongst Pagans, where there is no godliness, or Christian Religion.

8. There is in Heathen Kings a regal and Kingly power to establish Christian
Religion and add regal sanctions to Christian Synods, though there neither
is, nor can be, during the state of Heathen Paganism, any Christian Religion
there; this power is essentially and actu primo, regal, yet as concerning
execution, it is vertuall only.

9. There is a difference betwixt a royal command under the pain of (...)
punishment, with a royal power to punish the contraveners (...)
ecclesiasticke, and a nomotbeticke power to make Church Laws; (...) has the
former power, but not the latter.

10. If the royal power be of that transcendent and eminent greatness, as to
make Laws in all things, belonging to Church (...), and so as Camero.
praelect. 10. 1. p. 370. 372.
Camero must be heard, saying, that the ^ing is the supreme ruler, and
Churchmen be as servants, and instruments under him, and do all in the
external government of the Church by virtue of the Kings supreme authority,
the King is not much honored by this; for they must say that the King in the
Physician gives dregs to the sick, in the Plowman labors the earth, in
the fashioner seweth and s^a^eth garments, whereas Paraeus Paraeus com. in Romans
13. in append. ad du^. 5. P^arogn^t. 6.
who without reason also gives to the Prince a nomothetick power in
Church-matte^s, does except some things that the Prince cannot do, sometimes
for want of right and law, other sometimes for want of knowledge, sometimes
because it is against the dignity of his Majesty, as in sordid and base arts.

11. The power of governing the Church of the Jews, though it was ordinarily
in the Priesthood, the Sons of Aaron, whose ^ippes did preserve, ex officio,
knowledge, Mal. 2. yet as the Prophets were raised up by God, extraordinarily
to teach, they (...) by that same extraordinary power did govern, and
therefore though the Kings of Israel were not Priests, yet without doubt some
of them were Prophets, and as Prophets they did prophecy, and as Prophets
determine many things of Government, by that same extraordinary power by which
some of them, to wit David, and Solomon, did prophecy, and pen Ca^ ni^k
Scripture.

12. There is one consideration of abuses and heresies manifestly re(...) to
Gods word, and another of those things that are ordinar^(...). In the former
there is no need of the Churches ministerial power of condemning them, and
therefore Ezechias, Jos^as, Asa, ^^osaphat, did manifestly by the light of
nature, and Gods word (...) abuses, and Idolatry in Gods worship without the
Churches (...), seeing the Church representative was guilty of these cor(...)
us themselves; but in the latter, seeing the Kings place is to com(...) and
compel by external force and bodily punishments, and it is the Churches part
to teach, inserme, bind, and loose, therefore the King can make no Church
Canons.

Hence our first conclusion. The Christian Magistrate as a Christian is a
member of the Church, but as a Magistrate he is not formally a member or part
of the Church.

1. Because he is neither a Pastor, Doctor, Elder, nor Deacon, as is clear to
any, for these offices were complete in the Church without the Magistrate,
Ephesians. 1. 11. else Christ ascending to heaven should have given Kings, for the
edifying of his body; Neither is he as a Magistrate a part of the company of
believers. 1. Because then all Magistrates as Magistrates should be professors
of the faith, which is known to be false. 2. Because the Magistrate, as such,
is the head of an external politic civil society, not of Christ's body.

2. The Magistrate as a Magistrate wants such things as essentially
constituteth a member of the Church, as a Magistrate only he has neither
baptism, profession, nor faith, because then heathen Magistrates should not
be Magistrates, the contrary whereof the Word of God says, Jeremiah in Gods
name commanded to obey the King of Babylon, and Paul commanded to pray for
Kings and heathen Magistrates, 1 Timothy 2. 1. Hence let us have leave to deny
these, (He who is the Churches nurs-father, is the Churches father, and a part
of the family.) 2. (Whose office it is to cause all in the visible Church to
profess the truth, obey God, and keep his Commandments, he is a member of
the Church.) 3. (He who is a keeper and preserver of Law and Gospel by his
office, he is by his office a member of the Church.) For the first: he is a
father metaphorically, and does by an external coactive power, and by the
sword nourish the Church, and therefore is not the Church, nor a part of the
Church, ex officio, by his office, as the nurs-father is not the child, nor a
part of the child, whereof he is nurse-father; and this, and both the other
two are to be denied, because the Magistrate does neither nurse the Church,
nor cause the Church do their duty, nor desend the Law and Gospel by any
power that is intrinsecally Church Power, but by the sword, and coactive power,
which in no sort belongs to Christ's kingdom as a part thereof, either as it
is internal, and invisible, or external or visible, which is not of this
world, Joh. 1^. 36.

3. By no word of God can Salc^b^ig. pap 121.
Salcobrigiensis, and (...) p (...). 1. c 8.
Weemes prove, that the Magistrate as the Magistrate is a mixed persen, and his
power a mixed power, partly civil, partly ecclesiastic, for ^^ the ruler
comes in amongst the ordinary Church Officers, ^ m. 12. Ephesians. 4. 11. 1 Timothy
2. 2. which the Word of God does ^^ver insinuate, and he should no less watch
for souls, as ^^e who is to give an account to God, then other
Church Officers, Heb. 13. 17. for the Magistrates office may be performed by
himself alone, he himself alone may use the sword in all things, which he
does as a Magistrate, as is clear, Romans 13. 1. and 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14 the King
judging his alone, and the Kings deputy sent by him judging his alone is to
be obeyed, but no Church power, mixed or pure, and unmixt is committed to any
one man, but to many, as to the Church, Matthew. 18. 17. 1 Cer. 5. 2. 3 4. 2 Cor.
2. 6

4. The Magistrate as the Magistrate has a civil dominion ever the body,
goods and lives of men. 2. And has the sword to compel men to do their
duties. 3. And compels to external obedience, and leads men on to
godliness and to eternal life, by external pomp, force and the terrors of
bodily and external punishment, and his warfare is carnal, a^ the Dan 3. 29

Dan. 6. 26, 27.

Luke 22. 24. 29

Rem 13 4.

1 Pet. 2 13, 14. etc.

1 Timothy 2. 2.


Scripture does prove; but the Church, and members of the Church as they are
such, have no majoritie of dominion, 1 Pet. 5. 3, 4. Luke 22. 24. 25. over the
body, and goods, and blood of men. 2. They have not the sword, nor power of the
sword, Joh. 18. 36. John 8. 11. Luke 12. 13. 14. 2 Cor. 10. 4. 3. The Church as
the Church deals by the word of admonisting, teaching, rebuking,
excommunicating, praying and requesting, as the Col. 2. 16.

^ These. 5. 11, 12.

l ^v 19. 17.

Matthew 18. 15. 16, 17.

1 Cor. 5. 2, 3, 4.

1 Timothy 1. 20.

1 Timothy 5. 20.

2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.

2 Cor. 10. 14.


Scripture clears: therefore the power of the Church and the power of the
magistrate must dister in spece and nature.

5. If the Magistrate be a chief member of the Church, as a Magistrate with
mixed power to make Church-Lawes, then is the Church not perfect in its being,
and operations, to obtain the end convenient to the Church as the Church, so
long as it wants the Magistrate, because it should be made defective, and
not able to exercise all its operations for the edification of Christ's body,
and gathering of the Saints, Ephesians. 4. 11. without this principal member,
especially seeing the Magistrate is alleged to be a member, or integrall
part of the Church, such as the head or eyes, otherwise without this, or that
professor, a Church may be perfect, as an army may be perfect, without this or
that common Soldier, but wanting a Leader it should not be perfect. But so it
is that the Church is and was perfect in its being, and operations, without the
civil Magistrate; the Church of Corinth where the Magistrate was a heathen,
and a Pagan, 1 Cor. 6. 1, 2, 3. is yet a Church sanctified in Christ Jesus,
called to be Saints, 1 Cor. 1. 2 graced, v. 4. enriched by Christ in all
utterance and knowledge, v. 5. coming behind in no gift, v. 7. with power of
excommunication which attaineth its proper end, the saving of the spirit in the
day of the Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 5. 4. A perfect body of Christ, 1 Cor. 12. able
to edify the whole body, 1 Cor. 14. 12. 25, 26, 27. having power of the seals
of the Covenant, 1 Cor. 11. 20, 21, 22, 23. So was there a perfect Church-Synod
without the civil Magistrate, Act. 1. Act. 6. Act. 15. and all for the saving
of the redeemed Church is laid upon the Eldership of Ephesus, Act. 20. 28, 29,
30, 31. without the Magistrate.

6. If the King be a mixed person endued with Church power to make canons, and
because anointed with holy oil, capable of jurisdiction ecclesiastical, as
some say, then as he is a King by birth, so is he also borne with an
ecclesiastical power to exercise spiritual jurisdiction: but Paul says, all
ecclesiastical power that he had, was given of God, not borne with him; he
was made, not borne a Minister, Col. 2. 25. the power to edify was given him,
2 Cor. 10. 8.

2. Conclusion. We cannot by the Word of God acknowledge that difference,
betwixt the Magistrate, and the Christian Magistrate, that the Magistrate as a
Magistrate has a kingly power to rule over men as men, and the Christian
Magistrate has a Christian kingly power to rule over men as they are
Christians. Because by one and the same kingly power the King rules over men
as men, and men as Christian men, commanding by the sword and kingly power that
Pastors preach sound doctrine, administrate the Sacraments aright, that all the
Church profess Christ, and abstain from blasphemy, and Idolatry. He is the
minister of God for good, Romans 13. Ergo, he is the Minister of God for all
good, for a Christian good, and is a King compelling to a Christian good: Also
though the King were not a Christian magistrate, yet has he a Kingly power to
command men as Christians, and it is by accident, that he cannot in that state
actually command Christian duties, and service to Christ, because he will not,
and cannot command these duties remaining ignorant of Christ, even as a King
ignorant of necessary civil duties cannot command them, not because he
wants kingly power to command these civil things, for undeniably he is a
Judge in all civil things, but because he has not knowledge of them. 3.
Christianity makes him not a King over Christians as Christians, for then he
could not be their King, and were not a King over Christians, so long as he
wants Christianity, which is false, for the Christians acknowledged heathen
Emperors as their Kings; the people of God were to obey Nebuchadnezzar,
Darius, Cyrus, and other beathen Kings. Paul will have obedience and subjection
due to every power, Romans 13. 1, 2. 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. 1 Pet. 2. 7. 18. 4. It
makes way to the popish dethroning of Kings when they turn heretics, and
leave off to be members of the Christian Church, which we abhor. 5. A King
is parens patriae, the father of the Commonwealth. Now Christianity adds no
new fatherly power to a father over his children, for a heathen father is as
essentially a father, as a Christian Father, and a heathen commander in war,
a heathen husband, a heathen master, a heathen doctor or teacher, are all as
essentially commanders, husbands, etc. in relation to their soul diers, wives,
servants, and scholars, as are the Christian commander, the Christian husband,
the Christian master, and Christian Doctor, in relation to Christian soldiers,
Christian wives, etc. and no man can say that Christianity gives a new
husbandright to the husband, once a heathen, over his wife, that he had not
before.

3. Conclusion. The King is not debarred as King from the inspection,
oversight, and care of ecclesiastical affairs, but the end of the Kingly
power, is not only external peace, but also godliness, 1 Timothy 2. 2. And in
the intrinsecall end of magistracy as magistracy, is not only natural
happiness, and a quiet of life; as M. Anton. de domi. Archie. Spala^ens. l. 6.
c. 3. n. 4, 5, 6. seq.
Spalat^, and after him that learned author Gulielm. Apollon. de jure magist^a.
in sacr. pa^. ^. c. 4 and 5.
Apollonius says, but also godliness that we may lead a quiet and a
peaceable life, in all godliness and b^nes^ie; Ergo, in all that may conduce
to life eternal, he is a King by office, but in a coactive and regal way.

2. The ruler is (Romans 13. 4) The minister of God to thee for good, v. 3. Do
that which is good, and thou shall have praise of the Ruler: then look how
far good and well doing, which is praiseworthy extends, as far does the
intrinsecall end of magistracy reach; but this good, and welldoing which the
magistrate as the magistrate procures, is not only a natural happiness, and
the quiet life of a civil society, but also the good and well doing of
Christians as Christians, to wit, public praying, praising, preaching, hearing
of the word, religious administration and receiving of the Sacraments, all
which the King as King is to procure; for what ever good external Pastors as
Pastors do procure, that same also, but in a civil and coactive way, is the
King as the King to procure, and therefore his end as King is godliness, and
eternal life, but he is busied about this end, after a far other and more
carnal way then the pastor, the weapons of whose warfare are not carnal. 3.
That the Kings end intrinsecall, as King, is more then external and natural
peace, is clear, because ill doing against which he as the Minister of God, is
to execute vengeance, and wrath, Romans 13. 3, 4. is not only that which is
contrary to external quietness of the commonwealth, and the natural
happiness of civil societies, but also that which is contrary to the
happiness supernatural of the Church as believers in the way to life
eternal, for he is to take vengeance upon blasphemy, idolatry, professed
unbeleefe, neglect of religious administration of the seals, and the eating
and drinking damnation at the Lords Table, which are ills not formally contrary
to external quietness, but which are directly scandalls, and moral ills
hindering men as members of the Church in their journey to life eternal; for
though men should never fall o^ sin against the external quietness of the
natural happiness of the members of a commonwealth, yet the magistrate as the
magistrate is to execute vengeance upon all external ill-doing, as blasphemy,
adoring of idols. 4. The magistrate as the magistrate, in the zeal of God, is
to set himself against sins, as dishonorable to God, and his glory, seeing
the judgment that he executes, is not man's, but the Lords, 2 Chronicles. 1^. 6.
and he is a little God in the room of God, yea God ^^tteth judging in, and
through him, Psalm. 82. v. 1. and therefore his end is not only to punish
sins, as they trouble the external peace of the commonwealth, but all
external sins, that may wound the honor of God, and against which the
magistrate, as he is such, is to be armed and clothed with zeal. 5. Those who
with Spalato teach that life eternal is not the end of the magistrate, as a
magistrate, but only the extrinsecall end of the magistrate, or the end of the
person who is the magistrate, must foulely err; so it is not, in their
meaning, the end of the office or kingly art to maintain religion and pi^tie,
but this is the end of the person clothed with the office, and so they deny
that God has destined the kingly office to help men as Christians to heaven,
and to promove Christ's kingdom mediatory, and they must be forced to say, God
has ordained magistracy to help men as men, or as they have a life common to
them with the beasts, and not to help them as Christian men, to ^^ie from the
wrath to come, and obtain life eternal, which certainly is against the honor
of magistracy, Esa. 49. 2^. Revel. 21. 16. Psalm. 2. 10, 11, 12.

Psalm. 71. v. 10, 11, 12.


which of its own nature is destined for the promoving of religion, else the
magistrate as the magistrate is not a nurs-father in the Church, nor to bring
his glory to the new Jerusalem, nor to kiss the Son, nor to exalt the throne
of Jesus Christ, contrary to the Word of God. 6. Yea they were only to promove
the Church as a society of men, and to set up the throne of justice for the
second table of the Law, and not a throne for piety, and for the first table
of the Law, which is observed by August. con^r. liter. Petilian. l. 3. c. 92

differ in the objects, the Magistrates powers (say they) object is things
earthly, and the external man; the power of the Church is things spiritual,
and the inner man.

I answer, these two powers differ in the objects no question, I mean in the
formal objects, not in the material, for the magistrate as a magistrate is a
nurs-father, and keeper, and avenger of both Tables of the Law, and has a
coactive power about hearing the word, administration of the Sacraments,
Idolatry, blasphemy, and the right serving of God in Jesus Christ, and these
things are not res terrenae, earthly things, or things of this life, but
spiritual things. Yea the affairs of Jehovah and the Kings matters, 2 Chronicles.
19. 11. says Amesius, Ames. de Conscien. l. 5. c. 25.
are not so different, non it a disparata sunt, as that the care and knowledge
of the things of God, belongs not to the King, sed it a distinguuntur, ut in
modo procurandi, rex politice suas parts agat, and sacerdos ecclesiastice
suas; the objects of the magistrates power, and of the Churches power may be
materially and are one and the same, but the King works in a coactive and
kingly way, and the Church in an ecclesiastic and spiritual way.

For do not both the King as King, and the Church as the Amesius Medul. Theol.

Church, command and forbid one and the same thing? does not the King command
the right worship of God, and forbid Idolatry, and the Blasphemy of God? and
does not the Church in their Synodical Canons command and forbid one and these
some things? yea certainly, but the King does command and forbid by a kingly
and coactive power, under the pain of bo^^lv punishment, as incarceration,
exile, proscription, or death, according to the quality of the fact. And the
Church commands also the right worship of God, and forbids Blasphemy and
Idolatry, but by a spiritual and ecclesiastic power, and under the pain of
spiritual and ecclesiastical censures, as open rebuke, suspension, and
excommunication; and they differ not so in their ends, as some teach, so as the
end of the Church powes should be the communion of Saints, and the edifying of
the body of the Church, which I grant is true, and the end of the Ruler should
be only preservation of peace, and the external tranquillity of the
Commonwealth: yea (I say from the Word of God) that external peace is too
narrow an end, and it does belong to the second Table, the Kings end as
Nurse-father and his a like care is to preserve the first Table, and as a
Nurse-father, to see that the childrens milk be good and wholesome, though the
milk come not from his own breasts; and so his power has a kingly relation
to all the Word of God, and not to external peace and natural happiness
only. And the King as the King, his end is edification and spiritual good of
souls also, but always by a kingly power, and in a coactive way, by the
sword, whereas the Church, are in their care of edifying souls, to use no such
carnal weapons in their warfare, 2 Cor. 10. 4. For which cause Martyr. loc.

the Professors of Leyden say that Ministers deal with consciences of men,
Quoniam Spiritus Sanctus (inquit Martyr) vim suam adjungit cum praedicationibus
orthodoxis, the holy Spirit conjoyneth the power and influence of grace with
sound preaching; and the Magistrate does only exercise external discipline.
And Parker reasoning against Whitgift and (...), proves well that the Church
visible, though external, yet is Christ's spiritual Kingdom, and that Church
discipline is a part of Christ's spiritual Kingdom, and that the external
government of Christ by discipline, is spiritual every way, according to the
efficient, 1 Cor. 12. 1. according to the end, spiritual ^dification, Ephesians.
4. 12. according to the matter, the Word and Sacraments, 2 Cor. 10. 3, 4.
according to the form of working, by the evidence of the Spirit, 2 Cor. 2. 4.
13. And this is the cause (I conceive) why great Divines have said the object
of the Magistrates power as a Magistrate is the external man, and earthly
things, because he does not in such a spiritual way of working, take care of
the two Tables of the Law, as the Pastor does; and yet the spiritual good and
edification of the Church in the right preaching of the Word, the Sacraments,
and pure discipline is his end. It is true, whether the blasphemer profess
repentance, or not, the Magistrate is to punish, yea and to take his life, if
he in seducing of many, have prevailed, but yet his end is edification, even in
taking away the life; for he is to put away evil, that all Israel may fear,
and do so no more: but this edification is procured by the sword, and by a
coactive power, and so the Church power and the kingly power differ in their
formal objects, and their formal ends. But Anthon. de Dom. Arch^epis^^.
Spalatens. l 6. c. 3. 9. 10.
Spalato speaks ignorantly of Kings. Who says, as the internal and proper
end of the Art of painting, the Art of sailing, etc. is not life eternal, but
only to paint well, according to the precepts of Art, and to bring men safe to
their harborie, though the persons who are painters and sailers may direct
works of their Art to life eternal: so (says he) the end of the kingly Art is
not life eternal, but only the external peace of the Common*wealth; hence
infers he, that there is no subordinatim betwixt the power of the
Magistrate, and the power of the Church, but that they are both so immediate
under God, as the Church cannot in a Church way regulate the King, as a King,
but only as he is a christian man; the Church may rebuke the King, while as he
abuses his kingly power to the destruction of souls, and that the Church
power, as such, is not subordinate to the kingly power, only the King may
correct with the sword the Pastors, not as Churchmen and Pas^ors, but as men
who are his subjects. But, 1. whereas it is certain the King in respect of
politic power is the immediate Vicegerent of God, and above any subject in his
Dominions, so does the Bishop, make the Shoemaker, the Painter, the
master-fashioner immediate unto God and censurable by none, as they are
Artificers, even as the King is censurable by none as King, and so the King is
dishonored, who by office is the Lords anointed, and a little God on earth,
Psalm. 82. v. 1. (2) The intrinsecall end of kingly power is no more the
advancing of godliness, and the promoving of the Kings daughter toward life
eternal, by the sincere milk of the Word, as the Lords Vicegerent, and
Nurse-Father of the Church, then the Painter as a Painter, or a Seaman as a
Seaman is to advance godliness: for this man's intrinsecall and is only a
safe harbor and shore to temporal lives, not the harbor of salvation to
souls; and his end is only a fair Image of Art in Paper or Clay, not the
Image of the second Adam; and by this the King as King is interdicted of any
Church business, or care of souls to be fed by the Word or Sacraments, to
keep them clean; if he look to any of these, as an end, that is not the eye
or intention of the King as King, but of the King as a godly Christian, (says
Spalato:) hence to care for the spiritual good of the Church, and the
promoving of the Gospel is as accidental, as to say, an excellent Painter,
such as Ap^ies, intends in his painting life eternal: so the King, by this,
looks to the Law of God, to Religion and the eternal happiness of the
Church, by guess, by accident, and as King, has neither chair nor room in
Christian Synods, nor a seat in the Church. 3. If the meaning be, that the King
as King, that is rightly exercisng the office of a King, is subordinate to no
Church power, that is, he cannot be justly and deservedly rebuked by Pastors,
that is most true, but nothing to any purpose; for so the Pastor as a Pastor,
Jeremiah as he does truly and in the name of the Lord exercise the prophetical
office, cannot be deservedly censured, nor punished either by the
Church-synodrie, or the King and Princes of the Land: but thus way all members
of the Church, an I any one single believer, doing his duty, should be as
immediate, and independent, and highest next on earth to Christ as the King,
and his three Estates of the Honorable Parliament are in civil matters, and
as an Occumenick Council, or in our brethrens meaning, independent
Congregation, which is against reason. But if the meaning be, the acts of a
King as aberring from justice, not as a King, but as a frail man, may be
censured and rebuked deservedly by Pastors in a Church way; this way also, the
Pastor as a Pastor is not subject to the Church, but only as a frail man, and
so nothing is said to the purpose in this more then the in the former. But if
the meaning be thirdly, that which only makes good sense, that the acts of
the King abstracted from good or bad, or as kingly, or not moral, nor acts of
justice or injustice, more then the acts of Painting, of sailing, of making of
Shoes, and thus the King is not subject to the Church power, nor is his
intrinsecall end as King, justice, and godliness and preservation of Religion,
the man speaks nonsense, and wonders; for the King as a King is a moral
agent, and not infallible in his Laws or administration. Ergo, as a King he is
under the Scepter of the King of Saints in discipline, and in the keys of the
Kingdom of God, and so the kingly office is subordinate to the power of Christ
in his Ministers and Church discipline, and by that same reason, the power and
offices of Ministers as they are moral agents and obnoxious to sin, to false
doctrine, blasphemy, idolatry, idleness and sleepiness in feeding the flock,
are under the coactive power of the supreme Governor; and he does as King use
the sword against them: hence it is clear that both the kingly power is
subordinate to Church Power, and that the subordination is mutual, that also
the Church Power is subordinate to the kingly power, and that both also in
their kind are supreme; the kingly power is the highest and most supreme, and
under no higher coactive power: I mean the kingly as kingly conjoined with the
collateral power of Parliaments, where the Realm is so governed, and the
Church Power is the highest in the kind of Ecclesiastical power. Joan. Major
Parisien. lib. 4. sent. did. 24. q. 3.
Joan. Major says well, that they are not subordinate, that is, not one of
them is above another, that I grant, but that which he and Spalato says,
neutri in alteram est imperium, that neither of the two has a commandment
over another, that we deny, yet are they powers in office and nature different,
for they differ in their objects. 2. Use and end. 3. And their manner of
specific operations, and the Kings power is not ecclesiastic.

Others say that there was a perfect civil policy, having no need of the
Church power, anent the perfect civil government amongst the Heathen, and in
Christian Commonwealths, the civil power of it self and of its own nature
can do nothing, for the attaining of eternal happiness, except we would go
to the tents of Pelagians, whither Papists do lead us, while as they teach
that the natural end of civil power, of its own nature and intrinsecally is
ordained to eternal happiness. But the civil power of it self does confer
nothing, whereby the spiritual power of the Church has intrinsecally, and
properly, and formally its dignity, power, strength, and proper virtue; and
does produce its own proper effect and end, because, as says Sp^l^tens de
^ep. eccles. l. 6. ^. 3. n. 17.
Spalato, the civil Magistrates end is of another republike different from the
Church, he is head of the Commonwealth, and civil body: see Guli^l n.
Apollonius pastor (...) Magist. par. 1. c 3. page 5^, 53.
Apollonius.

But I answer, there is a Policy civil without the Ecclesiastical Policy, and
the King is essentially a King, though neither he be a Christian himself, nor
his subjects Christians; and to the essence of a King, and to the essence of a
civil government, Christianity and a Church Power is not required, yet has
the King as King essentially a right and civil coactive power to promove
Christian Religion, and the edification of Christ's body, though he be a
Heathen; the want of Christianity does not take away his kingly right, only it
binds up and restrains the exercise thereof; but though he be a King
essentially, and actu primo, while he wants Christianity, and so is a perfect
Magistrate, quoad esse, and the State that he rules over, a perfect civil
body, quoad esse, in respect of essence and being, yet is he not a perfect
Magistrate, quoad (...) operari, neither he nor his civil State and body are
perfect in operations. And it follows not that the King as King can doc
nothing about the obtaining of life eternal, for as a King he has a perfect
right, and kingly power to do, and being a Christian he actually exercises
that power, as a Nurse-father of the Church, to see that the Kings daughter be
fed with wholesome milk, to see that the first and second Table be kept, and
that men serve Christ, and have the seals of the Covenant in purity, under the
pain of suffering the weight of his royal sword; and I wonder that this
should be called nothing for the obtaining of eternal happiness, seeing it is a
way to eternal happiness to be thus fed under a Christian King as a King. But
(say they) it is Pelagianism that the Kings power compelling the Nurses to let
out their breasts to the Kings daughter, that she may suck the sincere milk
of the Word, should be a mean of eternal happiness. I answer, and it is also
Pelagianisme to say, that the planting of Paul, and watering of Apollos, and
the ministerial power and pains of Ministers, without the grace of God, can
produce or effectuate supernatural happiness, and it is false that the kingly
power of it self does confer nothing whereby the spiritual and ecclesiastical
power has intrinsecally and formally dignity, and power, and its proper
effect; for it is true, the kingly power makes not the ecclesiastical power,
but it sets it on work, in a coactive way, for the edifying of Christ's
body, and does causatively edify. Lastly, whereas it is said the King as King
is over the civil body and the Commonwealth, which is a body different in
nature from the Christian body or Church; I say, that is false, for the King as
King rules over men, as men, and also as Christian men, causing them to keep
both the Tables of Law. But 3. (say they) the office of a King is not a mean
sanctified of God for a supernatural good, because it is amongst the Gentiles.
I answer, this is no consequence, for that office of it self is sanctified and
ordained of God, for keeping of both Tables of the Law, and that it works not
this, in its own kind, is not from the nature of the kingly office, but from
the sinful disposition of the Gentiles; so the Word is the savor of death to
some, through their default. Ergo, it is not a mean sanctified for that end;
it follows not. But 4. the office of the King of it self and its own power
does not govern or subdue the inward man, for immediately and of its own
power it cannot bind the conscience, but only by the interveening mediation of
the Word of God. Ergo, of it self it intends not to produce a supernatural
and eternal good. Answ. Nor can the office of a Minister of it self, and in
its own power, produce a supernatural good, but only by the authority of the
Word, Esa. 8. 20. Jer. 23. v. 22. Tit. 1. 9. 10. is it therefore no office
sanctified for a supernatural end? But 5. they reason, a supernatural good,
and life eternal, are effects flowing from the mediatory office of Christ,
bestowed upon the Church: but the kingly power flows not from the Mediator
Christ, but from God as Creator, who bestows lawful Kings and Magistrates
upon many Nations, who know nothing of a Savior.

I answer, When I consider the point more exactly, I see not how Kings, who
reign by the wisdom of God Jesus Christ, Prove. 8. 14. 15. have not their
kingly power from Christ, who has all power given to him in Heaven and in
Earth, Matthew. 28. 18. for they are Nurse-fathers of the Church as Kings, Esa.
49. 15. they are to kiss the Son, and exalt his Throne, as Kings, Psalm. 2.
11. they bring presents and kingly gifts to Christ as Kings, Psalm. 72. v. 10.
11. and they serve Christ not only as men, but also as Kings, as Augustine
says: August Epist ad Ro^^faccom. 50.
therefore are they ordained, as means, by Christ the Mediator, to promote his
kingly Throne. Some of our Divines will have the kingly power to come from God
as Creator, in respect God gives Kings, who are his Vicegerents, to those who
are not redeemed, and to Nations who never heard of Christ; and others hold
that the kingly power flows from Christ-Mediator, in respect he accomplisheth
his purposes of saving of his redeemed people, by Kings authority, and by the
influence of their kingly government, procures a feeding ministry and by
their princely tutory, the edification of his body the Church, which possibly
both aim at truth. See Survey of discipline. c. 23
the groundless carping at Cartwright, Calvin, Beza, and others, by that sharp
toothed envier of truth the Author of the Survey of holy discipline: of this
hereafter more.

4. Conclusion. The King as King has not a nomothetick, or legislative power
to make Laws in matters ecclesiastic, in a constitute Church, nor has he a
definitive sentence, as a Judge.

1. All power of teaching publicly the Church or the Churches of Christ, is
given to those who are sent and called of God for that effect: but Magistrates
as Magistrates are not sent nor called of God to the public teaching of the
Church. Ergo. The proposition is clear from the like, Romans 10. 14. How shall
they preach, except they be sent? Ergo, how shall they publicly and
synodically teach, except they be sent? Heb. 5. 4. No man takes this honor
upon him, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron, etc. Ergo, if none be a
Priest to offer a Sacrifice without Gods calling, neither can he exercise the
other part of the Priesthood, to teach synodically, and to give out ((...))
decrees, Acts 16. 4. that obliges the Churches ecclesiastically, but he who is
called.

2. Who so has nomothetick power to define and make Laws in matters
ecclesiastic, have only a ministerial power to expone Christ's will in his
Testament, under pain of Church Censures, and has no coactive power of the
sword to command these Laws enacted, and to injoyne them on the Churches. But
only Churchmen, who are formally members of the Church, as Pastors, Doctors,
Elders, and others sent by the Church have this ministerial power; without the
coactive power of the sword, and what ever the Magistrate as the Magistrate,
commands, he commands it, in things ecclesiastic necessary and expedient,
under bodily punishment; I add this, because threatening of bodily punishment,
is not essential to Laws in general, because some Laws are seconded only
with rewards, as the Judge offers by law a reward to any, who shall bring
unto him the head of a Boar, or of some notorious robber. Ergo, etc. The
proposition is clear; the learned Iunius C^nt. 3. l. 1. c. 20. not. 12.
Junius gives to the Magistrate with our Divines, an interpretation of
Scripture, as a Judge; which concerns his own practice, they are
interpreters, pro communi vocationis modo, in a Christian way, as private men,
but they have no power of ecclesiastic interpretation. 2. Gul. Apolon. de jure
Magistr. par. 2. c. 4 page 257.
Gul. Apollonius says, the Prince as a Christian, has an office to exhort the
Svnod, by word or Epistle, as Constantius did the Fathers of the Nicen
Council; and his Legates exhorted the Council of Chalcedon, ut Deo rationem
reddituri. See Ruffinus Eister. eccles l 1 c. ^.
Ruffinus Act. conc. Clalced. act. 2
and the acts of the Council of Chalcedon. 3. The Magistrate has a power
judicial, as a Magistrate, in so far as his own practice is concerned, to
expone the things defined, but this expotition he uses, non instruendo
synodice, non docendo ecclesiastice, sed docendo seu potius mandando cum certa
relatione ad paenam a brachio seculari insligendam contemptoribus, not in an
ecclesiastical way teaching and instructing synodically, but teaching or
rather commanding with a certain relation to civil punishment, to be
inflicted upon the contemners; as he teaches, what is just, or unjust in his
civil Laws, not directly to inform the mind, but to correct bad manners, and
this makes the object of kingly power about Churches matters, and the object
of ecclesiastical power, formal objects different.

3. Those who have a nomothetick power to define in Synods, are sent by the
Church to Synods with authoritative commission and power for that effect,
representing the Church which sent them, as all who are sent with any embassage
do represent those who sent them. But Magistrates as Magistrates, are not sent
to represent those who sent them with authoritation commission of the Church.
Ergo, they have no such power ^^d^ine in Synods. I prove the proposition from
the Apostles practice: Paul and Barnabas were sent as chosen men by the Church
(...) Antioch, Acts 15. 2. 3. Acts 15. 6. the Apostles and Elders came from the
Church to consider of this matter, Acts 21. 18. Acts 22. 17. (...) 2 Cor. 8 17,
18. if the Apostle with the Church sent Titus (...) Brother, whose praise is in
the Gospel, as chosen of the Churches, to travel with us, v. 19, in gathering
the charity of the Saints, for the poor at Jerusalem, then by the like, those
who are sent to declare the minds of the Churches, are also clothed with the
authority of the Churches, who sent them; but Magistrates a^ such, are not
sent, but are there with the sword of Commonwealth, and not with the mind of
the Church, as Magistrates, except they be also Christians.

4. The Apostolic Synods, is to us a perfect pattern of Synods. but persons
defining in them are Apostles and Elders, Acts 16. 4. Acts 15. 6. the Church,
Matthew. 18. 18. defines, and 1 Cor. 5. 4. those who are conveened in the name
of the Lord jesus, and the Apostles pastoral spirit, those who are over us in
the Lord, and watch for our souls, 1 These. 5. 14. Heb. 13. 17. but in these
Synods there are no Magistrates, yea there was at C^rinth a Heathen Magistrate,
1 Cor. 6. 1. and in the Apostolic Church a persecutor, Acts 22. 1, 2, 3. etc.
And the Magistrate as the Magistrate, is not a member of the Church, and is
neither Pastor, Elder, nor Doctor, nor a professor of the Gospel, except he be
more then a Magistrate.

5. No Ecclesiastical power, or acts formally Ecclesiastical, are competent
to one who is not an Ecclesiastical person, or not a member of the Church, but
a civil person; but a power to define in Synods, and the exercise of acts
Ecclesiastical and matters Ecclesiastical, are due to Ecclesiastical
persons, and to the Church. Ergo, they are not competent to the civil Judge.
The proposition is evident by differences betwixt Ecclesiastical persons and
civil Magistrates, which might be more accurately set down by others, then by
me. But they differ, 1. that the Churches power is spiritual, the Magistrates
causatively, effectively or objectively spiritual, but not intrinsecally and
formally spiritual, because he may command by the power of the sword
spiritual acts of preaching, administrating the Sacraments purely, of defining
necessary truths in Synods, and forbid the contrary, but he cannot formally
himself exercise these acts. 2. The Churchmen are members of the Church, the
Magistrate as such is a politic Father and Tutor of the Church, but not
formally, as he is such a member of the Church. 3. The power of the Magistrate
is carnal, and corporal, and coactive upon the bodies; for which cause,
Tylenus, Daneus and others say, the external man is the object of his power,
the power of the Church is spiritual, not carnal, not coactive, not bounded
upon the body; the Church has neither power of heading or hanging, but only
they may use the sword of the Spirit, exhortations, rebukes, censures,
excommunication. 4. Edification to be procured by the Word and Sacraments and
Church Censures, is the end of Church Power, but edification to be procured by
the sword, is the end of the civil Magistrate. 5. The Magistrate judges not
what is true and false to be believed simply, as teaching, instructing, and
informing the conscience, but only what is true and false to be believed or
professed in relation to his sword and bodily punishment, or civil rewards. 6.
The Magistrates judgment is kingly, supreme, peremptory, and highest on
earth, from which we are to provoke in no sort, except in appealing to God; the
Churches judgment is ministerial, conditional, limited by the Word of God.
7. The Magistrates power is over all, Heathen and Christian, over men as men,
and over men as Christians, and agrees to Heathen and Christian Magistrates
alike; the Church power agrees only to members of the Church, and is only
over members of the Church as they are such. 8. What ever causes the Magistrate
handles, as hurtful to the Commonwealth, and contrary to the Law of God, in
a politic and civil way, these same the Churches handles as they promote
edification; or if they be sins, the Church cognosceth of them, sub ratique
scandali, as they are Church scandals. 9. The civil power is above the
Churchmen as they are Churchmen, and members of a Christian Commonwealth,
and the Church power is above the Magistrate as he is a member of the Church
and to be edified to salvation, or censured for scandals, Matthew. 18. 17. 2
This. 15. 13. 1 Timothy 5. 20. and therefore there is both a mutual subordination
betwixt the honors, and also because both are highest and most supreme in their
^ind, they are also coordinate, and two parallel supreme powers on earth: as
the Church has no politic power at all, so has the Church no politic power
above the King, but he is the only supreme power on earth immediate under God;
so the King has no power formally and intrinsecally ecclesiastical over
either the Church, or any member of the Church, but the Churches power is
supreme under Christ the King and head of the Church. 10. The Churches power
may be without the Magistrate, and is complete both in being and operation, as
Acts 1. 1. and Acts 15. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. without it, yet it is
helped much by the Magistrates power, which is cumulative, to ad help to the
Church, and not privative, to take away any right or privilege from the
Church, for then the Church should be in worse case and greater bondage, under
a Christian King, then if there were no King to defend the Church at al, if the
Kings power were privative; and it is true the Churches own power is
cumulative, and not privative, because the Church has no power to take nothing
from it self; but the King is to add his royal ^^ield to the Bride of
Christ, out of zeal to the honor of the Bridegroom, for a politic promoving
of godliness, which the Church as such wants. But the kingly power though it
may be, and is, in Heathen Nations perfect in its being without the Church
power, yet is it not perfect in its operations, as is said. 11. The Church
power is to go before, and to define, prescribe and teach first, and the
civil power to add a civil sanction thereunto, as an accumulative and
auxiliary supplement. 12. The Magistrate has no power properly to define
controversies, yet has he the power of the judgment and discretion, and also
may with a coactive power cognosce in a politic way of Church matters in
reference to the use of the sword, but the Church as the Church has a
ministerial power (...), to define controversies according to the Word of God.
13. Every one helps another to obtain their own ends, but hey cannot be
contrary one to another formally, yet do these differences prove, that the
Magistrate, as such, cannot detine in a Synod, what is truly to be believed and
practiced by members of the Church, what not. And also godly Princes have
refused this. Hosius Cordubensis writes to Constantius the Arrian Emperor,
which words Athanasius commends. Desine, desine, quaeso, and memineris te
mortalem esse, reformida di^m judi^ii, neque te immisecas eco'esiasticis, nec
nobis in hoc genere praecipe, se^e^ potius a nobis disce: tibi autem d^us

Ambrosius epist. 14. ut alii. 33. ad Marcellinam sororem, dicit, se

Distin. 96. C. satis evidenter, illicitum est imperatorihus ecchsiasti ^ s^

Constantius would not take on him to judge the Arrian cause, but conveened a
Council, and commanded them to judge according to the word: So says Eusebius
de vita Constant. l. 3. c. 10. ad Theodor. l. 5. c. 9. Neither can it be said
that Constantine judged with the Synod as Emperor, as some affirm, for though
it be true, yet he judged not in the Synod as Emperor, but as Episcoporum
conservus as he names himself, and as Eusebius says, de vita Constant. l. 3.
c. 16. ipse tanquam unus e vestro numero, non recusabam. Now Constantine as
Emperor was not a fellow servants with Pastors or one of the number, but above
them, as the anointed of the Lord; but he judges with them, as one of their
number, as a Christian having one faith, one baptism, one Lord, with them; and
so as a member of the Church, and so says he in that same place, Literarum
divinitus inspiratarum testimonio res in quaestionem adductas dissolvamus. And
let this be our first distinction.

Emperors of old defined in Synods, as Christian members Distinct. 1.
of the Church, not as Emperors, for as Emperors they be politic heads of
the men of the Church. Gerardus Tom. 6. de Gerardus.
Magist. polit. n. 175. page 586, 587. who gives also a nomotheticke power to
Magistrates in matters ecclesiastical, furnishes us with an argument here,
because the Magistrate is a principal member of the Church, and all the
members of the Church are to judge and try the spirits, and to try all things,
now this proves well as a member of the Church, and so as a Christian he may
judge, and that in a mere ecclesiastic way, as Pastors and Elders does, as
private Christians may do, being called thereunto by the Church, though the
ground be weak, for the Kingly power makes not New, Tiberius and other
Emperors, members of the Church, only grace, faith, and communion with
Christ, makes Kings members of the invisible Church, and baptism and
profession of the faith, and not any earthly Prerogative of Scepter, or Crown,
makes them members of the visible Church.

Our second distinction from Fathers, is, that Emperors have a Kingly power
politic to confirm, and add their civil sanction Distinct. 2.
to Church constitutions, but they have no power formally ecclesiasticke to
define and make Church-lawes. So Augustine ad Bonisac. Commit. circa epist. 50.
Quia vero etiam Rex est ser vit, Leges justa praecipientes, and contraria
prohibentes, conventente rigore sanciend^, sicut servivit Rex Ninivitatum,
universam civitatem ad placandum dominum compellendo.
Augustine: as a man the King serves the Lord, vivendo fideliter, by living
the life of a sound believer, and as a King he serves the Lord, by adding the
convenient vigor of a civil sanction to just Laws -- as the King of Ninive
did, by compelling the men of Ninive to pacify God. And when Gaudentius the
Donatist objected that the Emperor could not take course with the Schism made
in the Church by their separation, because God has laid upon Prophets, not
upon Kings, the Preaching of the word: Augustine August. l. 2. co^r. epist.
Gaudentii. c. 26. quamdiu vos non tenetis ecclesia^, quam praenunciaverunt
Piscatores, Apestoli plantaverunt, tam diu reges qui eam tenent, rectissime ad
s^am curam indicant per^nere, ne ^os adversus eum rebelletis impune.
answers, not that Kings may either preach, or define controversies in the
Church, but that, sinco Donatists separate from the Church, it should be the
care of Kings to see, that none rebel against the Church of Christ. Hence I
reason thus, no Synods ecclesiastical can meddle with the blood and temporal
lives of men, nor can they forbid the belief and profession of heresies and
erroneous doctrine, or scandalls against pure discipline under the pain of
bodily punishment, as banishment, imprisonment, heading or hanging. But
Emperors and Kings, either in a Synod or out of a Synod, may lawfully forbid
such things, and that by a Kingly power, therefore if Emperors in Synods make
any Laws of this kind, they are not Synodicall, nor ecclesiastical Laws,
nor do they make such Laws, jointly with the Church-Synod, as some teach, nor
by any ecclesiastic power, for coactive power, and ecclesiastical power,
cannot be joined together as one power, to make one and the same
ecclesiastical laws. Let any judge then if the ancient Laws of some
Emperors were any other things, but civil and politic sanctions of
Church-constitutions. And judge of this Law, which some call the
ecclesiastical determination of Imperat Constitut. ^.
Heraclius the Emperor by the consent of Pope John, he ordained that there is
n^ ^ther one nor two operations in Christ. Heraclius a Monothelite commanded
this under the pain of civil punishment, as is certain. But had Pope John as
collateral Judge with the Emperor in this, that same coactive power that the
Emperor had? I think none can say it. So In c^dice l. leg ^unctus populu^. c.
le s^m. Trinit.
three Emperors commanded all people to hold the doctrine of the Trinity, and
that those who hold not this be heretics. This is but a civil sanction of a
Church Law. So C^d^ce leg. 4. Synod Chaicedenensis de ^^de Christiana justa
cap^sitinnes a (...) a ^^ ^^d (...), per nost^a decreta statuta sunt.
Martianus commands that the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon be
established, and that no man dispute or call in question these decrees. This is
clearly the Emperors civil ratification of Church-lawes: and Justinian.
Novell. 123. c. 32.
Justinianus forbids any public service to be in the Church by laics
only, in the absence of the Clergy, and Novell. 137. c. 6.
commands the Bishops not to muttter in to themselves, but to speak in the
administration of the Sacraments with a clear and distinct voice. If Emperors
did proceed any further, as some say that Theodosius deposed the Nestorian
Bishops, though indeed he only L. 3. de s^^^. tr^n.
commanded them to be deposed, their deeds are not Laws, a facto ad jus non
valet consequentia. Papists here are in two extremities. For 1. they will not
have Princes to meddle with Church-affaires, whereas by office they are
Nursfathers in the Church. Charles the fifth is rebuked by Paul the third,
because he conveened counsels for composing of dissentions in the Church, and
he compares him to Uzzah, who touched the Arc without warrant, as we may see
Wolsius tom. 2 lect. moral. page 539.
Wolsius. 2. Stapleton, Bellarmine, Bellarmin. l 3. de la^cis c. 17.
and Papists will have them to be brutish Servants, to execute whatsoever the
Pope and Counsels shall decree, good or bad, without examination also; as
Suarez in opuscul. l. 3. de P^^mat. Sum^^ Pontif c. 22.
Suarez, the Council of Paris, their D^s^^on. 96. si (...).
Law says, and D^st. 22. inc. Qu^ties 24. q. 1.
Innocentius the first, and In cap^^e qu^ di^^et.
Gregory the seventh do teach: Making Kings in their judgment slaves to the
Pope and 'his determinations, and to have no light but from their vertuall
Church, as the Moon has all her light from the Sun.

Our third distinction is, that the Magistrate as Magistrate, and a preserver
of public peace, may do some thing, when a Schism and dissension is among
the Churchmen in a Synod. 1. In this case he may punish perturbers of peace,
as Augustine answers August. cont. epist. Gauden. l. ^. c. 26.
Gaudentius the Donatist, and the separaters from the Church, in which case the
Magistrate indirectly condemns one of the parties, which the Church has
condemned: but there be many other cases of dissension in this case; therefore
when the Magistrate finds the Synod divided in two parties equally; or three,
i^ the corrupt part prevail; or four, in the case of the Churches aberration
in one particular fact: or five, if there be an universal apostasy of the
whole representative Church: or six, an universal defection of both the
representative and essential Church: all these being too casual and of too
frequent occurrence, one and the same answer cannot be given, and here be
sundry subalterne distinctions considerable.

Hence our fifth Conclusion: when there is an equal rupture in the body,
nothing extraordinary would be attempted, if ordinary ways can be had: if Saul
the ordinary Magistrate had at Gods Commandment killed Hagag, Samuel the
Prophet should not have drawn his Sword, and therefore in this case the
Magistrate would first seek help from other Churches, as that Apollonius de
jure Magist. ^oc. cit page 206.
learned Apollonius says. But if that cannot be conveniently had, as in a
national Church it may fall out, then the Magistrate as a preserver of peace
and truth, may command the sincerer part to conveene in a Synod, and do their
duty, as the good Kings of the people of God did: 2 Chronicles. 15. Asa gathered
together a people who entered in Covenant to seek the Lord God with all their
heart, and laid an obligation of punishment to death on the rest, v. 12, 13.
and Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 23. 4. he laid charge on Hilkiah the High Priest,
and the Priests of the second order, whom he knew to be better affected to the
work, to bring out the Vessels made for Baal; which proves that the King
should put the sincerest to do that, which in common belongs to the whole,
in which case of the erring of the most part of the Church, the Prince
indirectly condemns the erring part of the Synod, because it is his place to
forbid and to punish with the sword, the transgressors of Gods Law. But because
his power is accumulative, not privative, under that pretense he has not
power to hinder the sincerer part to meet and determine according to the Word
of God.

6. Conclusion. In the case of the prevailing of the corrupt part of the
Church, or in the fourth case of the aberration of the Church in one
particular, the King has a regal power to punish the Canonists, if they shall
decree in their Synod Popery, and heretical doctrine, and so give to the Bride
of Christ noisome and deadly milk; the Prince as nursefather may punish the
Canonists. 1. Because he is a keeper of both Tables of the Law, and has a
royal power to inflict bodily punishment upon all sins, even committed, in
foro exteriore ecclesiae, as the King may punish false teachers. 2. Because the
Magistrates power is auxiliary and accumulative, as a tutor and nur^efather,
who has law to help the Pupil, and to add to the inheriritance, but has no
Law nor power to take away any part of the inheritance from the Pupil; Ergo,
as a nursefather, he is to help the Church of Christ, against the wicked
Canons of the representative Church. If any object, then the King as King has
power to rescind and annull the ecclesiastical Canons; the contrary whereof
that learned author of Altar Damascenum Didoclavius dad. Caldern ^^d in altars
Damas^cnode commentatus ^egi^s, pa. 29, 30.
does prove.

I answer, that learned and worthy author proves that the Prince cannot annull
the Church-Canons, and that the council of Trent thought shame that the Pope
should absolve any condemned by the Church-Canons; and certainly the same
power that makes Canons should dissolve them; but the Kings power cannot make
Church-Canons, for it is a part of the ministerial calling to make Canons, and
therefore he cannot annull and dissolve Canons: but some greater Kingly power
is due to the King in the case of the Churches aberring, then in the case of
the Churches right administration; and as our Divines do justly give to the
Prince an extraordinary Kingly power in the case of universal apostasy of the
Church, as Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah, and other worthy reformers in the
Church of the ^ewes, did warrantably use their Kingly power, when the
Churchmen were corrupted and negligent in their duty; so in a particular case
of a particular error of the Synod, the King as King, may use his Kingly power
in this fact, that is, secundum quid extraordinary, for the King is obliged
as King to add his accumulative power of a civil sanction to all just and
n^cessary Church constitutions, and it the Canon or Church constitution be
wicked and popish, he is obliged to deny his civil sanction, and not that
only, (for he that is not with Christ is against him) but he is to employ
his kingly power against such Canons, and so is to deliver the Church of God in
that, and in denying his accumulative power to unjust Canons, he adds his
kingly power accumulative to the true Church, in saving them from these unjust
Canons.

2. Also it may be objected, If the King by a regal and coactive power may
annull and rescind unjust Canons, he may by this coactive power make Canons,
for it is that same power to make and unmake Canons.

I answer, if he may annull unjust Canons, that is, liberate his subjects from
civil punishment to be inflicted for refusing obedience to such Canons, and
for bid the practice of wicked Church constitutions under the pain of the
sword; It will not follow, that therefore he may make Canons, but only that
he may add his civil sanction to just Canons. 2. Neither can the King
properly annull the Canon, but only deny to add his civil authority for the
execution of such Canons.

But thirdly, it is objected, that the King bath a judgment that such Canons
are wicked and superstition; the Church-mens judgment at the assembly of
Glascow, Edenbrough, an. 1638, 1639. is that such Canons are lawful,
edificative, and necessary, then is the King obliged as King to deny his royal
sanction, and who shall be Judge in the matter?

If you say the Word of God, it satisfyeth not, because both the King, and the
Synod, alleges the Word of God, as norm ^ judicandi, a rule of judging, but
the rule of judging is not formally the Judge, but we uske who shall be the
visible ministerial and vocal Judge under Christ, speaking in his own
Testament, for the King is a Politic and civil Judge, and the Church an
Ecclesiastical Judge.

I answer, this same is the question betwixt us and Papists anent the Judge of
controversies, whether the Judge be a Synod or the Scriptures; and we answer
by a distinction, the Scripture is norm i judicandi. 2. Christ, the peremptory
and infallible Judge speaking in his own Word. 3. A Synod lawfully conveened,
is a limited, ministerial, and bounded visible Judge, and to be believed in
so far as they follow Christ the peremptory and supreme Judge speaking in his
own Word. But we deny that there is on earth any peremptory and in fallible
visible Judge. But to come yet nearer; if the King have sworn to that same
religion which the Church does profess, and so acknowledge and profess the
reformed religion of that Church, he must then acknowledge the lawful
officers of that Church to be his ordinary teachers, and the lawful ministers
of the Church, and that they are both in a Synod, and out of the Synod, to
preach, and to be ministerial definers of things contraverted, and that they
shall first determine in an ecclesiastical way according to Gods Word, and he
as King is to command them to determine according to Gods Word, under the pain
of civil punishment, and the Kings civil and coactive way of judging is
posterior and ratificator^e of the right and oxthodox ecclesiastical
determination, and Junius says that the Magistrates judging politic,
presupposes the Church judging ecclesiastical, going before; and Calvinus
inst^^. l. 4. c. 11. sect. 15.
Calvin Amesius to n. 2 in Bellarm. (...) at. c. 6. n. ^.
and Amesius are clear that in this case the Church is to cognosce of he own
ecclesiastical affairs. Ambrose writes to the Emperor Valentinian, that none
should judge of this cause which is ecclesiastical as one said, but a
Churchman, qui nec munere sit impar, ne^jure dissimilis. Gelasius the Pope
inveigheth against Anastasius the Emperor, because he confounded these two,
civil and ecclesiastical causes. But if the Emperor or King profess not the
religion of the land, and repute it false, and if the religion be indeed
heretical, then the Church is not constitute, and the case extraordinary; but
the truth is, neither the Kings judgment, as a certain rule to the
representative Church, nor the representative Churches judgment a rule to the
King, but the Word of God the infallible rule to both. Judgment may crook,
truth cannot bow, it stands still unmovable like God the father of truth;
but in this case if both err, ex cellently says Junius ar^ and. in ^ellarm.
de council. l 1. c. 12. (...). 18. Desiciente conjunctione Magist (...) aliquid
ecclesia extra ordine^n sace^^, q^^d ordina^ie non potest, and ^^ntra
desiciente ecclesia a suo officio, potest magi^^^atus (...) ordinein procurare,
ut ecclesia ad (...), ^d enim juris communis est, extraordinar^is mai^s remedia
eti am extra ordinem adhiberi posse.
Junius, the Magistrate erring the Church may do something extraordinarily, and
the Church erring the Magistrate may do something also in an extraordinary way,
as common equity and mutual law requires that friends with mutual tongues
bicke the wounds of friends. Also fourthly, some say, they who make the King
the head of the Church, acknowledge that the King does not judge, except the
matter be first defined in the Scriptures, and in the general counsels, yet
they give a primacie spiritual in matters ecclesiastical to the King, and
therefore if the King as King may forbid the inacting of wicked Canons, he
determines them to be wicked, before the Synod have passed their judgment of
them.

I answer, that learned Calderwood in (...) Damas^en^, page 20.
Calderwood says indeed, the pretended Lords of high Commission have an act
for them under Elizabeth stat. ^. ^. ^.
Queen Elizabeth for this effect, but it is made for the fashion, for all
errors and heresies are condemned in Scripture, but not only should there be
a virtuall and tacit determination of matters ecclesiastic, which is
undeniably in Scripture, and may be in general counsels also, but also a
formal Synodicall determination in particular must go before the Princes
determination in a constitute Church. The Prince may before the Synods
determination exhort to the determination of what he conceives is Gods will
in his Word, but he cannot judicially and by a Kingly power determine in an
orderly way, what is to be defined in a Synod, except he infringe the
Churches liberties, and judicially prelimit under the pain of civil
punishments, the free voices of the members of the Synod, which is indeed, an
abuse of the authority of a nurs-father.

But fifthly, it may be objected that he may, in a thing that is manifestly
evident by the Word of God to be necessary truth, command by the power of the
sword, that the Synod decree that, or this particular, so clear in the Word,
the contrary whereof being Synodically determined, he may punish by the sword,
and so he may judicially predetermine some things before the S^nod pass their
Synodicall act thereon, and if he may predetermine judicially one thing, he
may predetermine all things.

I answer: what the King may judicially determine and pun^^h with the sword,
that he cannot judicially predetermine and command in any order that he
pleases, but in a constitute Church, whereof he is a member and to be
taught, he is to determine judicially in an orderly way, as a nurs-father.

But sixthly, it may be objected, that if the King have a judicial power by
the sword to annull unjust acts, then has he a power to (...) them, though
he abuse that power in making them, as unjust, and then has he a power to
interpret Church acts, and to defend them; (...) Law Lib. 22. si (...) ^. de
leg^^^s princ^p.
says, it is not same power to make Laws, and to d^^^nd them, and interpret
them: see Paraeus. Comment. in R ^^. 13. dull. 5. mappend p^^. 8. arg. 2.
Paraeus.

I answer, the proposition is not universally necessary, except only in civil
matters, in the which, as the Prince who is absolute has supreme authority to
defend, and interpret civil laws, so has he power to make them; for if the
Magistrate has a supreme judicial power to interpret Church-Lawes, he is a
minister of the Gospel in that case, and may by that same reason administer
the Sacraments, so the argument is a just begging of the question. 2. Though
the King have power in case of the Church aberration (which is somewhat
extraordinary) it follows not therefore, in ordinary, he has a nomothetick
power to make Church-Lawes.

Also seventhly, it may be objected, if the King in case of the Churches
aberration, may by the sword rescind Church-Lawes, then may he make a Law to
rescind them: but those who a^firme that the King has a sort of primacie and
headship over the Church, say not that the King has any power formally
ecclesiastical to make Laws, as Ministers in a Synod do, but only that he
has a power to command any form of external worship, under the pain of
bodily punishment, they say not that the King may preach, administrate the
Sacraments, or excommunicate or inflict any Church Censures.

I answer, the transcendent power of Princesand their commissioners is not well
known, for the authors (says Calderwood (...). Da^nas. page 36. Lance^.
Andreas.
Calderwood) agree not among themselves; but it is true in words, the author
Tortur. torti. 95. dicimus regem gubernare ecclesiastica, sed non ecclesiastice.
est Tortura torti, the Bishop of Eli denies in words (if you have strong
faith to believe him) all spiritual headship over the Church, to the King, and
Burbilius in vindic. Tortu a tc^ti. pa. 55. non dicit (Ep. sc. Eliensis)
primatum spiritualem, sed primatum quoad spiritualia, de be ^i regibus omni
jure.
Burbillus also. But Hen. Salcobrigiensis in Becano. baculo page 140.
Henric. Salcobrigiensis calls the King primatem ecclesiae Anglicanae, the
Primate of the Church of England and ^ges oleo sacro uncti, capaces sunt
jurisdictionis spiritualis, because they are anointed with holy oil,
therefore are they capable of spiritual jurisdiction; also may (says he Page
creat propria autoritate, by his own authority, create Bishops and d^prive
them. See what Calderwood in altar. damas page 14, 15, 16. and seq.
Calderwood has said, and excerped out of the writings of these men; the King
as King, 1. convocateth Synods; 2. defines ecclesiastical canons; 3. gives
to them the power of an ecclesiastical Law; 4. executes Church Canons; 5.
appoints commissioners, who in the Kings authority and name, may try
heresies and errors in doctrine, punish nonconformitie to Popish ceremonies,
may confine, imprison, banish Ministers; 6. descerne excommunication and all
Church censures, and use both the swords; 7. relax from the power and censures
of all ecclesiastic Laws, give dispensations, annull the censures of the
Church, upon causes known to them, give dispensations against Canons, unite or
separate Parish Churches, or diocesan Churches; and by a mixed power partly
coactive and civil, partly of jurisdiction and spiritual, the King may do in
foro externo, in the external court of Church discipline, all and every act of
discipline, except he cannot preach, baptize, or excommunicate.

And whereas Cartwright says, when a lawful Minister shall agree upon an
unlawful thing, the Prince ought to stay it; and if Church ministers show
themselves obstinate, and will not be advised by the Prince, they prove
themselves to be an unlawful Ministry, and such as the Prince is to punish
with the sword. O but, says he Survey of discipl c. 23. pa. 262, 263.
the author of the Survey, how shall the Prince help the matter? shall be
compel them to conveene in a Synod, and retract their mind? but they will not
do this. 2. By what authority shall the Prince do this? even by
extraordinary authority, even by the same right that David did eat of the
Shewbread, if by ordinary authority the Prince would do it, yet do you
resist that authority also.

Answ. Though the Prince had not external force to compel Churchmen to
decree in their Synods things equal, holy, ju^, and necessary, yet it
follows not that the King as King has not Gods right, and lawful power to
command and injoyne them to do their duty; force and Law differ much, as
moral and physical power differ much. 2. If they decree things good, lawful
and necessary, the Prince has a power given him of God to ratify, confirm,
and approve these by his civil sanction, but he has no power ordinary to
infringe, or evert what they have decreed. 3. And if the Church be altogether
uncorrigible and apostate, then we say as follows.

7. Conclution. When the representative Church is universally apostaticall,
then may the Prince use the help of the Church essential of found believers,
for a reformation, and if they also be apostatick, (which cannot be, except
the Lord utterly have removed his candlestick) we see not what he can do,
but hear witness against them, but if there be any secret seeker of God, in
whose persons the essence of a true Church is conserved. The King by a royal
power, and the Law of charity is obliged to reform the land, as the godly
Kings, with a blessed success have hitherto done, Asa, J^siah, Jehoshaphat,
(...), in which case the power of reformation, and of performing many acts, of
due belonging to the Church officers, are warrantably performed by the King as
in a diseased body, in an extraordinary manner power recurreth from the members
to the ^^^^tick head and Christian Prince, who both, as a King, (...) ^^, in an
authoritative way is obliged to do more then ord^^^y, and as a Christian
member of the Church, in a charitative and common way, is to care for the whole
body.

8. Conclusion. The influence of the Princes regal power in making
constitutions is neither solitary, as if the Prince his (...) could do it; nor
is it 2. collateral, as if the Prince and Church with joint concurrence of
diverse powers did it; nor is 3. as some flatterers have said, so eminently
spiritual as the consultation and counsel of Pastors, for light only has
influence in Churches Canons, but the Princes power has only the power to
design, so as the Canon has from the Prince the power of a Law in respect of
us. The Kings influence in Church Canons (as we think) is as a Christian
antecedent, to exhort that the Lord Jesus be served; 2. concomitant, as a
member of the Church to give a joint suffrage with the Synod; 3. consequent, as
a King to add his regal sanction to that which is decreed by the Church
according to Gods Word, or otherwise to punish what is done amiss.

Now that the Prince as a solitary cause, his alone defines Church matters and
without the Church, and that by his ordinary Kingly power, wants all warrant
of the Word of God. 2. The King might have given out that constitution, Act.
15. It seems good to the holy Ghost, and to us, which in reason is due to the
ministerial function, for these are called Act. 16. 4. the decrees of the
Apostles and Elders, not the decrees of the King or Emperor, either by Law or
fact. 3. Christ ascending to heaven gave officers requisite for the gathering
of his Church, and the edification of the body of Christ, but amongst these in
no place we find the King. 4. If this be true, heathen Kings have right to
make Church-Canons, though they be not able, and be not members of the
Christian Church, and so without, and not to be judged by the Church, nor in
any case censured, Matthew. 18. 17. 1. Cor. 5. 11. and this directly is a King
Pope, who gives Laws by a Kingly power to the Church, and yet cannot be
judged by the Church. Burhillus and Thomson acknowledge that a Heathen King is
primat and head of the Church; and must he not then have power aciu primo, to
make Laws, and to feed the flock by external government? But Lancel.
Andreas, Biship of Ely Episco. Fliens. Tortur. terti page 39. in Ethnico e^st
tera potestas temporalis, idque sinc ordine ad potestatem ecclesiasticam. item
Rex quivis own de Ethnico Christianus fit, non perdit terrenum ju^, sed

Tortura torti says that a heathen King has a temporal Kingly power, without
any relation to a Church power, and when he is made of a Heathen King a
Christian King, be acquireth a new power. But the question is, if this new
power be a new kingly power, or if it be a power Christian to use rightly his
former kingly power; if the first be true; then 1. as learned Voetius Voetius
de potest. ecclesi. tract.
and good reason says, he was not a King before he was a Christian, for the
essence of the Kingly power stands in an indivisible point, and the essence
of things admit not of degrees. 2. Then should he be crowned over again, and
called of God to be a Christian King, and so he was not a King before, which
is against Scripture; for Nebuc^adnezzar was to be obeyed, and prayed for as
King by the people of God, at Jeremiahs express commandment. 3. So a pagan
husband becoming a Christian should by that same reason acquire a new
husband-right over his wife; contrary to the 1 Cor. 7. 13, 14, 15. the
Captains, or Masters, who of heathens become Christians, should obtain a new
right and power over their Soldiers and Servants, and they should come under a
new oath and promise to their Captains and Masters. 4. If the heathen King
have only temporal Kingly power, he had no power as King to take care that
God were worshipped according to the dictates of the Law of nature, and Law of
nations, and had power to punish, perjury, Sodomie, parricid, as sins against
the Law of nature, and the heathen King should not by office and Kingly
obligation be obliged to be a keeper and a defender of the tables of the Law
of nature, which is against all sense. But if the power which a heathen King
becoming a Christian King acquireth, be only a Christian power to use for
Christ the Kingly power that he had while he was a heathen King, then a
heathen King, jure regali, by a regal right is the head of the Church, though
he be a Woolfe and a Leopard set over the redeemed flock of Christ; yea
though he be the great Turk, he is a Pastor called of God and the Church,
though for his moralls, he be a Woolfe and a hireling, yet by office and Law,
he is a feeder of the flock. Talis est aliquis, qualem ius offi^ii requirit.
And certainly it is impossible that a heathen King can be a member of the true
Church, he wanting both faith and profession, which do essentially constitute
a Church Membership: if it be said he is ex officio, by his office a member,
that is nothing else but he ought to be a member of the Church, so all
mankind are members of the Church, for they are obliged to obey Christ, and
submit to him upon the supposall of the revealed Gospel, and the heathen King
is no otherwise a member by the obligation regal that lays upon him as King;
yea when the Gospel is preached, and the heathen King converted to the faith,
he is not a member of the Christian Church, as a King, but as a converted
professor, and so Christianity makes him not a Kingly head of the Church, but
what essentially constituteth him a King, that also constituteth him a
Christian King; Christianity is an accidental thing undoubtedly to the office
of a King.

2. They do no less err, who make the King and the Church officers
collateral Judges in Church matters, so as with joint and co^quall influence
they should be Canon makers. 1. Because perfect Synods are and have been in
the Apostolic Church without any influence collateral of Christian
Magistrates, as being against their will and mind, who were Rulers of the
people, as Acts 1. 14, 15. Acts 2. 46, 47. Acts 4. 1, 2. Acts 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Acts 15. 6, 7, 8. etc. 2. What the Church decrees in the name of Christ,
stands valid and ratified in Heaven and Earth, Matthew. 18. 17, 18. Joh. 20.
21, 22. whether the Magistrate assent to it or not, so that he has not a
negative voice in it by any ecclesiastic power, for Christ says not, What ye
bind on earth, in my name, shall be bound in Heaven, except the Magistrate
deny, as a collateral Judge, his suffrage; Now if he be a collateral Judge by
divine institution, no Church act should be valid in Christ's Court without him,
as excommunication not in the name of Christ, or performed by those who are not
the Church, but only in civil offices, is not excommunication; also what ever
the Magistrate does, as the Magistrate, he does it by the power of the sword.
Ergo, if he take vengeance on the ill doer, as his office is, Romans 13. 3. 4.
his acts are ratified in Heaven, though the Church as collateral Judges say
not Amen thereunto. 3. The coactive power of the King, and the Ecclesiastical
power of the Church, differ as carnal and spiritual, spiritual and not
spiritual, of this world, and not of this world, and are not mixed by the Word
often, as Joh. 18. 36. 2 Cor. 10. 3, 4. 2 Timothy 2. 4. and therefore it in one and
the same Church constitution, the King and the Church be joint and coequall
Judges and joint definers, the constitution must both be enjoined under the
pain of bodily punishment, which the Church, whose weapons are not carnal,
cannot command, and under the pain of Church censures, as suspension, rebukes,
and excommunication the King must command. Now the Canon should neither be an
Ecclesiastical, nor yet a civil Canon, but mixed, for the Canon makers
injoyneth with powers and pains which are not due unto them, nor in their
power. Now to make a Law (says (...). F^l(...). ^ ^. 53.
Field) is to prescribe ^ ^aw under the pain, which the Lawmakers has power
to inflict: but neither has the Church the power of the sword, 2 Cor. 10. 3,
4. Joh. 18. 36. nor has the King, by Gods ^aw, the power of excommunication.
See (...) 22.
Calderwood. And one and the same Law should be backed both by a carnal and
worldly power, and not by a worldly and carnal power. 3. The King as King must
have a mixed power, half kingly, ^^^ half ecclesiastic, and by the same
reason, the Church must have a mixed power, partly Ecclesiastical and partly
civil, and this were to confound the two kingdoms, the kingdom of this
world, and the spiritual kingdom of Christ, which is not of this world, Joh.
18. 36. condemned by Anselm^ (...) Matthew. 26.
Anselm^, and Hilarious ^^ntra (...) b^pist 40
Hilarious, and Bernard b^p^st. ad Fu^en.
Bernard, and (...)
Augustine. Put if they say, that every one has their influence partialitate
causae, non eff^cii, according to the nature of causes, then is not one and the
same Church constitution from both King and Church. See ^ 325. 3. 6.
Apollonius. But the Kings Canon is civil, the Churches Ecclesiastical, and
every one of them without another, perfect in their one kind. See G^^son. Bucer
de (...). page 9^.
what the learned Gerson, Bucer, and Amesius in (...). de 1^. 2. ^. 1.
Amesius says, further to add light to this point.

Those who maintain a third, that the Church Canons has all the power of
being Church Laws from the King, and all Ecclesiastical and oblieging
authority from him, and that they have only some help of consulting power
from the Church, are grosser Divines. See ^^an Weem^s de (...). de (...) 7 page
88. 89. seq.
Joan. Weemes, for so the King is the only Canon maker, and the Churchmen
gives advice only, as The Kings (...) for the Service B^ok of (...)land, A^.
1636.
the Kings Proclamation speaks, having taken (...) counsel of our Clergy, we
command such a worship, and ^. and so the Canon runs, it seems good to the
holy Ghost and the King as the Canon speaks, Acts 15. 2. the King is made an
Ecclesiastical and ministerial Pr^acher to expone publicly the Scriptures to
the Church of God, for all lawful Church Canons are but Ecclesiastical
expositions of Gods Word, and so the Emperors and Christian Kings are the
only lawful Canon makers and definers in Oecumenick Councels, and Bishops,
and Pastors, and Doctors have all a mere power of advising and counselling,
which certainly all Christians on earth sound in the faith, except women,
have. O whither are all the tomes of the Councels Oecumenick, national, and
provincial, evanished unto? 3. Kings justly by this are made Popes, and more
then Popes, for Kings only have a definitive voice in counsels, whereas
Papists give a definitive voice to all the lawful members of the council, no
less then to the Pope. We (...). Daplex (...) est, un^ (...) and. (...) in
(...), alia (...) s^u imperialis in senatu, illa pastorum, haec p^incipis est.
Weemes has a distinction to save the Kings invading the Church-mens place,
while as he gives to Pastors a ministerial interpretation of Scripture in
the Pulpit, and to the King a decretive and imperial power of interpreting
Scripture in the Senate. But 1. there is no exposition of the word at all
imperial, but only ministerial by the Word of God, except that imperial
interpretation, that the Pope usurpeth over the consciences of men, and this is
as Bancroft s^^na^ Pauli cruce^. 1589. p 1. 70
Bancroft said, that the King had all the honors, dignities and preheminencies
of the Pope, as Calderwood in altar. Damas. page 4.
Calderwood observes, and yet Edward the sixth, and Edward the eighth would
neither of them take so much on them. What difference betwixt a Sermon made by
the King in the Senate, and the Pastor in the Pulpit? It is that same word of
God preached; only the Kings is imperial, and so must be in his own as King,
the Pastors ministerial, in the name of Christ; the distance is too great. The
administration of the Sacraments may be imperial due to the King also, as a
pastoral administration is due to the Pastors 4. In the government of Church
there is nothing set down of the King, but of Pastors, to feed the flock,
Act. 20. 28, 29. to edify the body of Christ, Ephesians. 4. 11. to rule the house
of God, 1 Timothy 3. 2, 3, 4. 16. to feed the sheep and Lambs of Christ, John
21. 14, 15, 16. and always this is given to Pastors and Elders. I know that
Kings are nurs-fathers, to feed, edify, and watch over the Church,
causatively, by causing others so to do; but this will not content the
formalists, except the King command and prescribe the external worship of God.

Tooker, Bancroft, Whitegift, La^celot Andreas, Salcobrigiensis have a maine
distinction here: That Pastors and Elders rule the Church, as it is an
invisible body, by the preaching of the word and administration of the
Sa^raments, and of this government the foresaid places speak: but as the
Church is a politic visible body, the government thereof is committed to the
King. Bancroft page 48.
Bancroft said all the external government of the Church is earthly, and
W^i^e^gyft and Bancroft two gross Divines made for the court, say the
external government of the Church, because external, is ^^spi^^tuall, and not
a thing belonging to Christ's external kingdom, (^aith Bil^^n:) but this is, 1
false, 2. Popish, 3. Anabaptisticall, 4. ^yrannicall.

False, 1. Because external and vocal preaching, and a visible administration
of the Sacrament in such an orderly way, as Christ has instituted, is an
external ruling of Church members according to the ^aw of Christ as King, an
external ordaining of the worship, is an external ordering of the worshippers
according to the acts of worship thus ordered, as sense teaches us: but the
external ordaining of the worship, to preach, this, not this, to celebrate in
both kinds, by prayer and the words of institution, and not in one kind only,
is an external ordering of Gods worship: therefore as Kings cannot
administrate the Sacraments, nor preach, so neither can they have the external
government of the Church in their ^ands. 2. The feeding of the flock by
Pastors set over the Church by the holy Ghost, Act. 20. 28. includes the
censuring by discipline, even the grievous Woolves entering in, not sparing the
flock, but drawing disciples after them, verse. 29, 30, 31. and therefore
Pastors as Pastors are to watch, and to try those who say they are Apostles
(...) not, but do lie, R^vel. 2. 2. by discipline; so this external ^e^ding
is external governing committed to Pastors, whereas inward governing is indeed
proper to Christ the head of the Church. 3. What? do not the Epistles to
Timothy contain comman dements about external government to be kept
invi^^able by Timothy, not as a King I hope, but as a Pastor, even (...) the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Timothy 6. 14. and this takes away that
poor shif^, that the external government of the Church, as ^ page 65. and 304.
Tookerus says, was in the Apostles hands, so long as persecuting Magistrates
were over the Church. but now, when the Magistrates are Christians, the case is
changed, but the government of all su^^ as Timothy is, must be visible,
external, and obvious to men, as 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. ^. 16. 1 Timothy 5. 9. 1 Timothy 5. 19, 20, 21, 22. 2 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 Timothy 3 5. all which
must be kept until the coming of Christ, 1 Timothy 5. 21. 1 Timothy 6. 13. 2 Timothy
4. 1, 2. 4. If external government were in the Kings power, then were it his
part to rebuke publicly, to excommunicate, and to lay on hands upon the
Timothies of the Church; all which are denied by the formalists, and are
undoubtedly the Churches part, as the Church, Matthew. 18. 17, 18. 1 Timothy 5. 19,
20, 21, 22, 1 Timothy 3. 14. 1 Timothy 1. 20. 1 Cor. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. 5. Parker. de
polit. eccl. l 1. c. 7.
Parker proves well that the keys are Christ as Kings ruling in word and
discipline.

2. This is popish, for so does the Papists teach, as Stapleton de princip
doctrinal. l. 6. c 16
Stapleton and Becanus 10. 5. Opise cont. Spalat. l. 1. de repub. christi. c. 4.
Becanus, that the Pope, quo ad externum infiuxum, according to external
influence of visible government is head of the Church, and Christ according to
the internal influence of the spirit is the head of the invisible body of
Christ, and here the King is installed in that external government, out of
which our Divines by Scriptures have extruded the Pope, which is a notable
dishonor done to Kings; and as Parkerus de politeia eccles. l. 1. c. 6.
Parkerus observes. Raynold. collat. cum Hartio. c 1. divis. 2.
Joan. Raynoldus answers that, from two offices of the head, which is to give
life and influence of motion to the members, and also to guide and moderate the
actions external of the body, we cannot make two heads; and because the King
has some civil government about the Church, we cannot make two heads over
the Church, Christ one, and the King another under him.

3. This is Anabaptisticall; for because the visible government of the Church
is external, we are not to cut off all necessity of the ministry to feed
and rule with ecclesiastical authority, and because the Prince is gifted and a
Christian, to give all to him, for a calling there must be from God, for the
King to govern the Church of Christ by Laws, and prescribing external
worship therein, for Christ has left, Ephesians. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 1 Timothy 3. men to
be feeders and governors of his Church by office, whose it is to be
answerable for souls, Heb. 13. 18.

4. It is tyrannical, because it puts power into the Magistrates hand, to
take from the Church, that inbred and in^rinsecall power of external and
visible government over her self and members, which all civil incorporations
by instinct of nature have, and the Magistrate, as such, not being a member of
the Church has a headship, even being a heathen Magistrate, over the redeemed
body of Christ. 2. By this reason, the Lord Jesus as King has no Pastors in
his name to use the ^^ves of his kingdom, by binding and loosing; for
discipline being an external thing (say they) is not a part of Christ's kingly
power, but the King as Christ's civil vicar has this power: but I say all acts
of Christ as he is efficacious by the Gospel to gain souls, are acts of
Christ as powerful by the Scepter of his Word, and those who are his
instruments to exercise these acts are subordined to him as King of the Church,
but Churchmen by an external ecclesiastical power delivering to Satan, and
externally and visibly casting out of the Church, that the spirit may be saved
in the day of the Lord, are instruments subordined to Christ, who is
efficacious to save spirits by excommunication, and to gain souls by rebukes.
Greg. Magnus in Psalm pen^tent.
Gregorius Magnus says, those to whom Christ has given the Keys of his
kingdom, by these he judges, and why is this word the word of his kingdom?
the Scepter of his kingdom? the sword that comes out of his mouth, by which
he governs his subjects, and subdueth nations, so called? but because
Christ's kingly power is with those, whom he has made dispensators of his Word.

9. Conclusion. Nor has the King power of ordaining Pastors, or depriving
them, or of excommunication. 1. All these are acts of spiritual and
ecclesiastical power, 1 Timothy 3. 14. 1 Timothy 5. 22. Act. 6. 6. Act. 13. 3. Act.
14. 23. Tit. 1. 5, 6. and flow from the power of the keys, given by Christ to
his Apostles and their successors, Matthew. 28. 18, 19, 20. Mark. 16. 14, 15, 16.
Joh. 20. 21, 22, 23. Hence I argue, to whom Christ has given out his power, as
King of the Church, Matthew. 28. 18, 19. power of the keys, Matthew. 18. 18.
Matthew. 16. 19. and a commandment to lay hands, and ordain qualified men, for
the ministry, and those who by the holy Ghosts direction practiced that power
by ordaining of Elders, these only have right to ordain Elders, and their
successors after them: but Apostles and their successors only are those to
whom Christ gave that power, and who exercised that power, as the places prove.

2. Ordination and election both in the primitive Church of the Apostles was
done by the Church, and consent of the multitude, Act. 1. Act. 6. 2, 3, 4. 5,
6, etc. but the civil Magistrate is neither the Church, nor the multitude.

3. Ordination is an act formally of an ecclesiastical power, but the
Magistrate as the Magistrate, has no ecclesiastical power; Ergo, he cannot
exercise an act of ecclesiastical power.

4. If ordination were an act of Kingly power, due to the King as King; then 1.
The Apostles and Elders usurped in the Apostolic Church the office and throne
of the King, and that behoved to be in them an extraordinary and temporary
power, but we never find rules tying to the end of the world, given to
Timothies and Elders of the Church anent the regulating of extraordinary and
temporary power, that were against the wisdom of God to command Timothy to
commit the Word to faithful men, who are able to teach others, as 2 Timothy 2. 2.
and to set down the qualification of Pastors, Elders, Doctors, and Deacons to
Timothy, as a Church man, with a charge to keep such commandments unviolable
to Christ's second appearing; if Timothy and his successors in the holy ministry
were to be denuded of that power, by the incoming of Christian Magistrates. 2.
The King by the laying on of his hands, should appoint Elders in every city,
and the spirits of the Prophets should be subject to the King, not to the
Prophets, as the word says, 1 Cor. 14. 32.

5. Those who have a Church power to ordain and deprive Pastors, must by
office try the doctrine, and be able to (...) sayers, and to find out the
Foxes in their heretical ways, and to rebuke them sharply, that they may be
sound in the faith: but this by office is required of Pastors, and not of the
King, as is evident, 1 Timothy 3. 2. 2 Timothy 2. 2^. Tit. 1. 9, 10, 11. It is not
enough to say, it is sufficient that the King try the abilities of such as are
to be ordained, and the bontgates of heretical spirits to be deprived, by
Pastors and Church men, their counsel and ministry, and upon their testimony
the King is to ordain, and make, or exauthorate, and unmake Pastors; because
1. so were the King a servant by office, to that which Church men shall by
office determine, which they condemn in our doctrine, which we hold in a
right and sound meaning. 2. He who by office is to admit to an office, and
deprive from an office, must also by office, be obliged to be such as can try
what the office requires of due to be performed by the officer; nor is it
enough which some say, that the ignorance of the King in civil things takes
not away his legal power to judge in civil things, and by that same reason,
his ignorance in Church matters takes not away his power to judge in
ecclesiastical matters, for I do not reason from gifts and knowledge that is
in the King simply, but from gifts which ^x^fficio, by virtue of his Kingly
office is required in him. It is ^^ue as King he is obliged to read
continually in the book of the Law of God* Deuteronomy. 17. and to know what is truth,
what here^ie, in so fa^re as he commands that Pastors preach sound doctrine,
and that as a Judge he is to punish heresy. Some say he is to have the
knowledge of private discretion, as a Christian, that he punish not blindly. I
think he is to know judicially as a King, 1. Because he has a regal and
judicial knowledge of civil things, even of the major proposition and not of
the assumption and fact only. Ergo, seeing he is by that same kingly power to
judge of treason, against the Crown and the civil State, by which he is to
judge of heresy, and to punish heresy, it would seem as King he is to
cognosce in both, by a kingly power, both what is Law, and what is fact. 2.
Because the judgment of private discretion, common to all Christians, is due
to the King as a Christian, not as a King: but the cognition that the King is
to take of heresy and blasphemy, whether it be heresy or blasphemy, that the
Church ^^^^eth heresy and blasphemy, is due to the King as King, because he
is a civil Judge therein, and if the Church should call Christ's doctrine
blasphemy, Caesar and his deputy Pontius Pilat, as Judges civil, are to judge
it truth. Neither would I ^^i^^^ly here contend; for whether the Kings
knowledge of herese in the major proposition be judicial, or the knowledge of
discretion only, as some say, we agree in this against Papist^, that the King
is not a blind servant to the Church, to punish what the Church calls
heresy, without any examination or trial* but though the Kings knowledge of
heresy in the proposition and in Law, be judicial and kingly, yet because
he is to cognosce only in so far as he is to compel and punish with the
sword, not by instructing and teaching. It would not hence follow that he is
to make Church constitutions as King, but only that he may punish those who
makes wicked constitutions, because the Canon maker is a ministerial teacher,
the King as King may command that he teach truth, and he may punish
heretical teaching, but as King he is not a teacher, either in Synod or
Senate, in Pulpit or on the Throne; now if the King by office ordain Pastors,
and deprive them, by office he is to know who are able to teach others, and
must be able also to stop the mouths of the adversaries, and to rebuke them
sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, and this is required in Titus,
Chapter 1. 5 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. as a Pastor, and as an ordainer of other Pastors;
therefore that which is required of a Pastor by his office, must also be
required to be in the King by his office.

6. It is admirable that they give to Kings power to deprive ministers, but
with these distinctions. 1. He may not discharge them to preach and administer
the Sacraments, but to preach and administer the Sacraments in his kingdom, or
dominions, because the King has a dominion of places. 2. He may discharge the
exercise of the ministry; but he cannot take away the power of order given by
the Church. 3. He may deprive (say some) by a coactive and civil degradation,
because the supreme magistrate may confer all honors in the Christian
commonwealth, Ergo, he may take them away again, but he cannot deprive by a
canonical and ecclesiastical degradation. 4. He may caus^tively deprive,
that is, compel the Church to deprive one whom he judges to be an heretic,
and if the Church refuse, he may then in case of the Churches erring, and
negligence, as King deprive himself.

But I answer, the King as King has dominion civil of places and times, as
places and times, but not of places as sacred in use, and of times as sacred
and religious: for his power in Church matters being accumulative, not
privative, he cannot take away a house dedicated to Gods service, no more then
he can take away maintenance allotted by public authority, upon Hospitalls,
Schools, Doctors and Pastors. God has here a sort of propriety of houses and
goods as men have. Places as sacred abused are subject to regal power, he may
inhibit conventions of heretics. 2. The Apostles might preach in the Temple,
though civil authority forbid them. 3. Kings are as much Lords of places as
sacred and public, as they have a dominion of civil places, in respect the
King may be coactive power hinder that false and heretical doctrine be
preached, either in public, or private places, for this he ought to do as a
preserver of both tables and a bear of the Sword for the good of Religion; and
if they may command pure doctrine to be preached, and sound discipline to be
exercised, they may command the same to be done in public places.

The second distinction is not to purpose. 1. To discharge the exercise of a
ministry (says Alta^ Da(...) page 23. 24.
Calderwood) is a degree of suspension, and suspension is an ecclesiastical
degree to the censures of excommunication, and therefore the King may as well
excommunicate, and remit and retain sins, (which undoubtedly agrees to the
Apostles,) as he can suspend. 2. As for taking away the power of order, it is
a doubt to formalists, if the Church can do that at all, seeing they hold
Sacraments administered by ministers justly deprived to be valid; Ergo, they
must acknowledge an indeleble character in Pastors, which neither King nor
Church can take away. If then the King deprive from the exercise, he must
simpliciter deprive, by their grounds it is weak that they say, the King may
deprive from the exercise of a ministry within his own dominions; for (says
Calderwood Alta^ Damas^ page 2^.
they all know well that the King has not power to deprive men from the
exercise of the holy ministry, in either foreign Kingdoms. For the third way
of deprivation, it has a double meaning also. 1. If the meaning be, that as
the King by a regal and coactive power may take away all honors, either
civil or ecclesiastical, as he gives all honors, then this way of
depriving Ministers cannot be given to the King, for the King may give and
take away civil honors, for reasonable causes, according to the Laws. But in
ecclesiastical honors there be three things. 1. The appointing of the honor
of the office to be an Ambassador of Christ. 2. To give the true foundation
and real ground of a Church honor, that is, gifts and gracious abilities for
the calling, neither of these two do come either from King or Church, or from
mortal men, but only from Jesus Christ, who ascending on high gave gifts unto
men, and appoints both office, and gives grace for to discharge the office.
Yea since moral philosophy makes honor to be praemium (...), a reward of
virtue; the King does not give that which is the soundation of honor civil,
for civil virtue is a grace of God but in Church honor there is a third, to
wit, a de^^^nation of a qualified man, for the sacred office of the ministry,
and an ordination by the imposition of hands used in the Apostolic Church,
Act. 6. 6. Act. 13. 3. Act. 14 23. 1 Timothy 4 14. 1 Timothy 5.22 Whether imposition
of hands be essential to ordination, or not, I disput not, it is apostolic
by practice, yet there is something ecclesiastical, as praying of Pastors, and
an ecclesiastical designation of men, or the committing of the Gospel to
faithful men, who are able to teach others, 2 Timothy 2. 2. 1 Timothy 5. 22. No
Scripture can warrant that the King ordain Pastors by public praving, by
laying on of hands, or ecclesiastical blessing, or by such an ordination, as
is given to Timothy, and the Elders of the Church, Acts 13. 3. Acts 14. 23.
Tit. 1. 5,6. 7,8 9. 1 Timothy 4. 14. 1 Timothy 5. 22. 2 Timothy 2. 2. If any say the
King has a public and regal power in ordaining of Ministers, and so in
d^priving them, or a mixed power, partly regal, partly ecclesiastical, as he
is a mixed person, and the Church has their way of purely and unmixt
ecclesiastical calling or ordaining of Ministers, or the Church and the
Magistrate both does elect and choose the man, yet so that he is not elected
without the consent of the King or Magistrate in the Kings room.

I answer, many things are here to be replied. 1. That the King who may be
borne an heir to an earthly Kingdom, is also borne and by nature a mixed
person, and half a Minister of the Gospel, is against Gods word; ministers in
whole, or in part, are made so of God, not so borne by nature: in Aaron^
Priestha^d men by birth came to a sacred office, but that is done away now in
Christ. 2. With as good reason may the King preach and administer the
Sacraments, as a mixed person, as he may ordain, by ecclesiastical blessing,
imposition of hands, ecclesiastical designation any person to the Ministry,
that same auth nity of Christ which said to Timoth, Lay hands suddenly (...)
man, said also to him, 2 Timothy 2. 15. Study to be approved unto (...), a
workman that needs not to be ashamed, dividing the word right; that is, both
ordaining of Ministers, and pastoral preaching of the Word, or pastoral acts
flowing from an ecclesiastical power. How then can the one be given to the
King by virtue of that same mixed power? especially seeing baptizing it directly
called 1 C^r. 1. 17. a less principal work of the ministry then preaching.
It it be said, as ordination is performed by the King, is not an
ecclesiastical action, but civil, or mixed, partly civil, partly
ecclesiastical.

I answer: by that reason, if the King should preach and administrate the
Sacraments, these actions should not be called ecclesiastical actions, and
Uzzah's touching the Arc, should not be called an action by office incumbent
to the Levites only; and it might be said, the person being civil, the actions
are civil. And Uzziah's burning of incense upon the Altar of incense, was not
a Priestly act, but an act of a mixed power, he 2 Ch^on. 26. 10, 17.
was partly a King, and partly a Priest, who did perform the action, but he
was a Priest by sinful usurpation in that action, as we know. 2. This answer
is a begging also of the question.

2. Whereas it is said that the Church ordainech Pastors, and the King also,
but diverse ways: the one by a regal power, the other by me el^siasticall
power.

I answer: this is spoken to make the people, ad saciendum populum, for ejusdem
potestatis est, (says the Law) constituere and desti^^ere, it is the same
power to ordain and to destroy. The High Commission by the Kings authority
does deprive Ministers, without so much as the knowledge of the Church. If then
the King as King may deprive ministers without the notice of the Church, then
may the King as King also ordain Pastors without the notice of the Church. For
the action of the instruments as such, is more principally the actions of the
principal cause. 3 Election of a Pastor is far different from ordination of
a Pastor: the whole multitude as Christians have voices in the election of a
Pastor, and so has the King or his Magistrate, as a part and member of the
Church, but this gives no negative voice to the Magistrate in election, but
ordination is not done by all the multitude, it is a work of authority done
only by the Church Officers. 4. The coactive and civil degradation, must have
also correspondent thereunto a coactive and civil ordination of Pastors. Now I
ask what is a coactive ordination. If it be the Kings royal and civil
authority, commanding that the Church officers ordain Pastors at Christ's
commandment; This we deny not, they fight with a shadow or a night ghost; not
against us, who contend for this. But if they mean a coactive degradation by
the Sword, in banishing, imprisoning, yea and for just causes, punishing
Ministers to death with the Sword, this indirect deprivation we do not deny.
But so the King depriveth a man from being a Minister, when he is beheaded, or
hanged, or banished for civil crimes, no other ways, but as he depriveth a
man from being a Fashioner, a Sai^^r, a Plower, a Soldier, or a Father to his
own barnes, a husband to his own wife, for when the man is beheaded or
hanged, by the sword of the Magistrate, he is d^prived from being a fashioner,
a sailer, a father, a husband: and Solomen did not other way deprive Abiathar
from the Priesthood, then indirectly by consining him for treason at Anathoth,
so as he could not exercise the Priests office at Jerusalem. So after Junius de

Muketus, a man for the times, denies that the Prince can take away that

acknowledges Wedelius the same. That reasonlesse liar Lysimach Nicanor in
this* and in other things, has no reason to say, we borrow Jesuits doctrine
to answer this argument, for Becanus ^n ^pi^s^ul. 10. 2. de (...). ^^g. l. 3.

the Jesuit Becanus is not ^nacquainted with Jesuits doctrine against the
power of Kings, yet he answers that Solomen as King had no power over
Abiathar for treason, or any other crime, and therefore following Bellarmine
and Gretserus says, that Solomon did this by an extraordinary prophetical
instinct, yet Abulensis q 38. and 31.
Abulensis a great textuall Papist, and (...) ^4
B^naventura a learned Schooleman says this p^oveth that the King is above the
Priest, and that Priests in the Old Testament were not eximed from the civil
Judges sword and power: this is very doubtsome to (...) c. 2^ n. 2.
Suarez who ^aith, that it was a temp^rall civil punishment of exi^e, and that
^^^siti^n from the exercise of the Priests office followed upon the other. But
we need not this answer, for Solomon's sentence contains in t^rminis, a mere
civil punishment; and these words 1 King. 27. S. Solomon thrust out Abiathar
from being Priest to the Lord, seem not to be words of the Kings sentence of
banishment, but are relative to the fulfilling of the Lords word, and a
consequent of divine justice relative to the prophecy against Elies house.
Though verily I see no inconvenience to say that Solomon did indeed deprive him
from the Priesthood by an extraordinary instinct of the Spirit, as he was led
of God to build the Temple. 1. Because the text says, so Solomon thrust out
Abiathar from being Priest to the Lord, and ver. 35. and Zadok the Priest did
the King put in the room of Abiathar, which is a direct deprivation from the
Priesthood: but I contend not here.

But that the King causatively may deprive, that is, command the Church to cast
out heretics, and to commit the Gospel to faithful men, who are able to
teach others, 2 Timothy 2. 2. we confess: as for the power of convocating of
Synods, some think that the King may convocate Synods as men, but as Church
men they have power, if the Magistrate be averse, to convocate themselves, see
Junius (...). 4. l. 1. c. 12. a^t. 4.
Junius who insinuates this distin^tion. But certainly though the Kingly
dignity be thought merely civil, yet let this be thought on; it may be
thought that the Kings power is divine three ways. 1. Effectually, and so we
think that the Kingly power is an Ordinance of God lawful, jure divine; many
Papists say the contrary, but we think with Gods word, it is of divine
institution, as is clear, Psalm. 2. 11. Prove. 8. 14. 15. Romans 13. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6. Matthew. 22. 21. 1 P^t. 2. 17, 18. Eccles. 9. 20. Prove. 25. 2. Prove. 20. 2.

2 The Kings power may be thought divine, formally, and so as divine is opposed
to civil, it is a humane ordinance, and not formally divine or
ecclesiastical, nor subjectively.

3. It may be thought divine and ecclesiastic, objectively and finaliter. The
end intrinsecall being a spiritual good, and so the King has power to
conveene Synods not only as they are men, and his Subjects, but also as they
be such subjects and Christian men, and members of Synods; as the King may
command the minister of the Gospel both as a man, yea and as a Preacher in the
Pulpit, to preach ^ound doctrine and to give wholesome and good milk to the
Church, and this is formally an act of a nurie-father, such as the King is by
his Kingly office: and this way also does the King send members to the Synod,
and moderate, and preside in Synods, actu imp^rato* n^n elicito: actu objective
ecclesiastico; non intrinsece, non formaliter, non subjective eccles^astico.
The King rules by the Sword, and commands the Synods to meet, orders
politically and civilly the members and meeting, and as King cooperateth, but
by a civil and regal influence, with the Synod, for the same very end that
the Synod intends, to wit, the establishing of truth, unity, and the
edification of Christs-body. But this power of the Kings to conveene Synods, is
positive, not negative, auxiliary and by addition, not by way of impedition or
privation. For the Church of her self, has from Christ her head and Lord,
power of conveening without the King, beside his knowledge or against his will,
if he be averse, as is clear Matthew. 18. 17, 18. if they be conveened in his
name he is with them; not upon condition that the Prince give them power. And
Joh. 20. 19. there is a Church-meeting without the Rulers, and a Church-meeting
for praying, preaching, and discipline, Act. 1. 13, 14. etc. without the
Magistrate, and Act. 15. 1, 2. and when the Magistrate is an enemy to the
Church. 2. Where Christ commands his disciples to preach and baptize, Matthew.
28. 19, 20. and with all faith in the exercise of their ministry, they shall be
persecuted by rulers, as Matthew. 10. 17, 18, 19. Luke 21. 12, 13, 14. He does by
necessary consequence command Church-meetings, and Synods, even when the
Magistrate forbids, and this is practiced, 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. where
the Magistrate is an heathen, chap. 6. 1, 2, 3. 3. It should follow that Christ
cannot have a true visible Church, and ministry on earth, except the Magistrate
countenance his Church, which is both against experience, and Christ's Kingly
power, who reigns in the midst of his enemies, Psalm. 110. 2. And what
glorious Cour^bes had Christ in Asia, with power of doctrine and discipline,
and ^o with all Church-meetings, Rev. 2. chap. 3. where Tyrants did slay the
witnesses of Christ, Rev. 2. 13. and certainly by what power Kings allead^e
that Synods may not meet, for the exercise of discipline and good order in Gods
house, by that same power they may say there should be no Church meeting for
the hearing of the word and receiving the Sacraments, without their authority.
For Church Synods for doctrine differ not, in spece, and nature, from Synods
for discipline, all be one and the same acts under Christ as King and head of
his Church, for which see Spalato de repub eccles l. 5 c. 5 ^. 88* 8.

polit. to. 6. n. 171. page 5 ^^.
Gerardus says that Moses gave Laws both to the People and Priests, Exodus 20.
Lev. 8. Number. 3.

I answer, if this be a good argument, the Magistrate his alone without advise
of the Church may impose Laws, yea and institute new Laws, and dite Canonical
Scripture also, as did Moses, Deuteronomy. 5. Exodus 20. but it is certain that Moses
gave these Laws, not as a Magistrate, but as a Prophet of God, who spoke with
God face to face, and it is more for us, then for our adversaries.

David also brought the Ark to its place, at Gods special direction, the
Levites carrying it by Gods Law, though they failed in that sinful omission, 2 Samuel 6. but 1 David did convocate the chosen of Israel, even thirty thousand,
to reduce the Ark to its place, and so the Levites and Churchmen, and did it
not as King his alone, as 1 Chronicles. 13. he did it. And Junius 1 Chronicles. 13. 1.
Junius says (and the text is clear) that he did it by the counsel of an
Assembly and the whole Church, and that a King may do that in Gods worship, in
case of the negligence of the Church, that is warranted by Gods word, is but
his duty. Now Jesuits answer not to any purpose in this, for Becanus in (...).
de (...) 5. n 30 (...).
Becanus, and Suarez (...). 25. n. 12.
Suarez answer nothing to David's placing of the Arc in its place, only they
say all the people conveved the Arc and danced before it, as well as David,
but it is not hence proved, that all the people are heads of the Church, as
they say the King is: and Lysimachus the Jesuit sees in this that we a^^ee
not with his friends the Jesuits.

Solomon builded the Temple, and dedicated it to Gods service, but this is no
ground to make the King a Lawgiver in the Church. 1. Because none can deny but
Solomon did all this, as a Prophet, by special revelation: for 1. if Solomon
might not build an house to the Lord, but by special revelation, that he
should be the man, and not David his father, 2 Samuel 7. 6. 13. far more could
he not as an ordinary King, build that typical house, which had a resemblance
of Christ, and heaven it self, especially seeing the signification of the Holy
of holiest in the Sanctuary is expressly given to the holy Spirit, Heb. 9. 7,
8. and the Temple was a type of Christ, Joh. 2. 20, 21. and they may say Kings
by an ordinary power as Kings might pen Canonick Scripture, as well as they
could build a typical Temple like Solomon's. God filled that Temple with his
glory, and heard prayers made in that temple and toward that Temple. I think
Kings as Kings cannot now build such Temples; therefore Solomon by a
Prophetical instinct built that house. Jesuits give no answer to this, for
Suarez opused. 3. (...). 25 n. 1^.
Suarez says Kings may build Churches to God; because of it self it is an act
of Religion which requires riches for the building thereof, and for the
dedication it includes two, 1. By some religious action to consecrate a house
to God; and this way only the Priests by sacrificing dedicated the Temple, and
God by filling of it with his presence, dedicated it to himself. 2. It
includes an offering and giving of an house to Gods service.

I answer: by this Solomon as a private man builded the Temple, and dedicated
it to God, and not as either King or Prophet; but this is a vain answer, for
no private man could have builded an house to God, with such typical relations
to Christ, and to the Church of the New Testament, except he had been
immediately inspired by the holy Ghost. Becanus de prima^^ reg^o l. 3. ob. 4.
pa. 73.
Becanus says three sorts of men were actors here, 1. Solomon, 2. The Priests,
3. The people: Solomon prayed and gave thanks, the Priest^ ^arried the Arc,
the Tabernacle, the holy vessels, and sacriji ^s, the (...) present, rejoiced
and gave thank^s to God: there is nothing (...) Solomon's headship; Solomon
dedicated a Temple to God, what, it will no more follow, he was the head of
the Church for that, (...) ^ffered stones and timber to God, then the wom^n can
^ee (...) of the Church, who offered to God g^^d, purple, (...) budd^^ Temple
to God, many Mer^han^s ^ubild Temple^ upon their (...) God, and pray to God to
accept these Temples; (...) in England (...) Temples to God, they are not for
that head of the Church.

Answ. 1. This is another Temple then Temples builded daily; 1. Because it was
will worship for David to build this Temple, and service to God for Solomon a
King of peace, and a type of our King of wisdom Christ, to build this Temple
and for no other; any Merchant may build a common house to Gods service,
without a special word of promise, which word Solomon behoved to have, or then
he could not build this house. 1. To dedicate an house to God typical of
Christ; 2. Filled with the cloud of Gods presence, where God said, he would
dwell in this house; 3. With such ornaments as the Holy of holiest in it; 4. In
which God said he would hear prayers; whereas now in all places he hears
prayers, Joh. 4. 21. 1 Timoth^ 2. 8. this is another positive worship then that
a merchant build a house for Gods daily service, which has no relative
holiness in it, but only is holy in the use, and to dedicate a house in these
terms is more then an ordinary dedication to Gods service, and their Prelates
in England, who dedicated Temples to God, cannot answer this reply of the
Jesuits, nor can the new Jesuit Lysimachus Nican^r their brother answer the
Jesuit herein; we say from warrant of Gods Word, that Solomon did all this,
by a prophetical instinct, by the which also he prophesied, and did write the
book of the Pro^^rbs, Ecclesiastes, and Solomon's Song; else Jesuits may say
that these books do no more prove Solomon to be a Prophet, then the tomes
written by Becanus and Suarez, does prove that they were divinely inspired
Prophets.

Obj. David also prepared materials for the Temple, 1 Chronicles. 22. 2. and
dicided the Levites in certain ranks and orders, 1 Chronicles. 23. 4.
Answ. 2 Chronicles. 8. 13. for so had David the man of God commanded, the man of
God is the Prophet of God, not the King of Israel as King, 2 Chronicles. 29. 25. and
he set the Levites in the house of God with Cymba's and psalteries and ^arpes
according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the Kings Seer, and N^uh^n
the Prophet, for so was the commandment of the Lord by his Prophets; they may
prove then God the Prophet is the head of the Church, and has power to make
Church-Lawes. But it is a great mistake. H^^^^iah, David, Solomon, commanded
the people and the ^evites to do their duties according to Gods Word. Ergo,
Kings may make Church-constitutions by a mixed power, it follows in no so^^;
we deny not but the King may command in Gods worship, what is already of
clear and evident divine institution, but that he may obtrude it, as a thing
to be observed, by all Church men, and urge it, as a constitution come from
authority, to b^e observed under the pain of ecclesiastical censures, we
deny: now this formalists teach, that he may command in the external
government, as a Church constitution to be in his royal name executed, by
Church men with Church censures, though the Church never heard of it before.

It is true that Jehoshaph ^t, 2 Chronicles. 19 8, 9, 10, 11. set of the Levites and
Priests, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the
Lord, and for controversies -- and charged them, to do in the fear of the
Lord, v. 11. and behold Amariah the chie^e Priest (says he) is over you in
all the matters of the Lord* and Zebadiah the son of Ismael, the ruler of the
house of Judah, for all the Kings matters; also the Levites shall be officers
before you; deal c^^ra^iously, and the Lord shall be with the good. Hence
does T^oker and other court parasites infer, 1. That the King constituting
Levites, and Priests in a City, must be head of the Church, and 2. That
Jehoshaph at having constitute two Vicars and D^puties under him, one in Church
matters, to wit, Amariah, another in civil matters, to wit, Zebadiah,
therefore has the King a jurisdiction and headship in both Church and State.

Answer 1. The institution of Priests is one thing, and the calling of the
persons to the Office another* the former was Gods due, who himself chused the
tribe of Levi, and this the King did not. But it is another thing to constitute
Priests and Levites, who were instituted and called of God, to serve in such a
place at Jerusalem, rather then in any other place; this is but to apply a
person, who is jure divine, by Gods right in office, to such places and times.
This is not a point of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, for placing and timing
Preachers belongs to the people calling them, and in the time of Apostasy, as
this was, Jehoshaphat sent Levites to teach, and commanded them to do their
duty; but that the High Priest is the Kings Deputy or Vicar, as if the King
offered sacrifices to God, as the principal and Church head, or by the
Ministry and service of Amariah, as his instrument, deputy and servant, is most
idly, and untruely spoken. Yet will I not use the argument of Be^anus the
Jesuit, who says, If Amariah was the Kings Vicar, then may the King by
himself sacrifice, for what ever the Vicar o^ deputy may d^e, that may the
person above him, who gives him power, d^e without the Vicar. The Kings royal
commandment is formally terminated upon the quality and manner of
Ecclesiastical acts, that they be done according to Gods Law, rather then
upon the acts according to their substance.

It Note.
is one thing for Ministers to Preach sound Doctrine, and administrate the
Sacraments in obedience, and at the Kings commandment, which we acknowledge a
truth, and another thing for Ministers to Preach in the name and authority of
royal Majesty, as having a calling from him: this latter is false: as the King
may do an act of justice, at the direction of a Minister, commanding him in
Gods name to execute judgment impartially: yet the King does not an act of
justice in the name and authority of the Church. And that is true which Be^anus
says, What the instrument does, the principal cause may do, where the Vicar
or Deputy, and the principal substitut^r of the Vicar are both civil persons,
or are both Ecclesiastical persons, for in a large and unproper sense, the
nurse is a sort of deputy under the nurse father, the Father may take care that
the nurse give milk, and wholesome milk to his child, yet cannot the Father
give milk himself. The King may take care, actu imperato, as one intending, in
a Kingly way, that Christ's body be edifyed, that the Priests and Prophets feed
with knowledge, the Church and sister of Christ, and so are the Priests under
the King, and at his command to feed, and to feed with wholesome food the
flock, and in obedience to the King all are to do their duty, and his care is
universal over all, and his end universal. That which is the end of Pastors,
Doctors, Elders, Deacons, Lawyers, Judges, etc. is, in an universal intention,
the Kings end, even Gods honor, by p^^curing in a regal way, that all do their
duty in keeping the two Tables of the Law, and so is he the great politic
wheel moving by his royal motions, all the under wheels toward that same end:
yet cannot the King without sin, and being like a Bird wandering from her
nest, do that which is properly Pastoral, so that the Office is not
subordinate to him, but immediately from God, yet are the operations of the
Office, and to Preach tali modo, diligently sound Doctrine subordinate to him,
but in a general and universal way, as he is a kingly mover of all, to keep
the two Tables of the Law. Neither did the King (as Suarez l. 3. de prima.
Pontif. c. 25 n. 7.
Suarez says) one and the same way appoint both the High Priest and the civil
Judge. And Cajetan comment. 2. paic. 19. v. 11. supren^a duo capita judicio^um
decernit.
Cajetan says, he decerneth the two chief heads of Church and Commonwealth,
but he appointed not both, for God appointed Amariah, to be High Priest, and
not the King, but here is nothing to prove the Kings headship.

Asa reformed the Church and renewed the Covenant; Ezekia^ reformed Religion
also, and brake in pieces the Brazen Serpent, and all these in the case of
universal apostasy, and the corruption of the Priesthood did reform the
Lords house, break in pieces graven Images, but all this gives to them no
mixed Ecclesiastical power of making Canons, of ordaining and depriving Pastors.

Whereas some object, That the care both of temporal good, and spiritual
good, belongs to the Magistrate, therefore, he must have a power to make
Church Laws. See Paraeus comment. ad Ro^. 13. dub. 5.
Pareus. For his care cannot be supreme, if he must rule at the nod and beck
of Churchmen.

I Answer, the connection is weak: he who has the care of both the temporal
and spiritual good of the people, he has a nomothetick power to procure both
these two goods, it follows no way, for then might he have a power in his
own person to Preach, and administrate the Sacraments, this power procures the
spiritual good, but such as is the care, such is the power, the care is
politic and civil, Ergo, the power to procure the spiritual good, must be
politic and civil.

2. Neither is the King to do all at the nod and direction of the Priesthood,
blindly and without examination. That is the blind doctrine of Papists, we
hold that he has a regal power to examine, if the Decrees of the Church be
just, Orthodox, and tend to edification, For he is the Minister of God, for
good, and to take vengeance on evil doing. And there is no just obligation to
sin, he is not obliged to punish with the sword, well-doing, but evil
doing, and the Church can oblige the Magistrate to do nothing, but that which
in case there were no Church Law, and in case of the Churches erring, he
should do.

2. They object, He to whom every soul is subject, he has a power to make
Church Laws, about all good: but all and every soul, without exception of
Apostles, or Churchmen, is subject to the civil Magistrate. Ergo. The
proposition is proved from the Law of relatives, for he to (...) we are
subject, he may give Laws unto us, for our g^^d. See Paraeus loc. citat.
Pareus.

Answ. He to whom we are subject, may give any Laws, or command any manner of
way, for our good. I deny the proposition in that sense; for then he might in
the Pulpit preach the Commandments of God, for our good. He might give Laws
under the pain of excommunication. It is enough that he may give Laws by
sanction and civil enacting of Church Laws, and pressing us by the power of
the Sword, to do our duty, for the attaining of a spiritual good. He to whom
we are subject, he may give Laws, that is press, in a coactive way, obedience
to Laws, that is most true, but it proves not a nomothetick power in the King.

3. They object, What ever agrees to the Kingly power concerning the good of
Subjects, by the Law of Nations, that does far more agrees Kings by the Law
of God. For the Law of God does not desir (...) ^e Law of Nations. But by the
law of Nations, a care (...) Religion belong th to the King, for Religion by
the Law of nature is ind^^ed and brought in by the Law of Nations. As Cicero ^
Tus^ul. nulla tam fera. tam (...) nis unq^am natio fu^, quam non unbue^it
religio ^^r^n.
Cicero says. And therefore to a Christian Kingly power, the care of Religion
must be due.

Answer: we grant all, for a care in a civil and politic way belongs to the
Christian Prince, but a care by any mean whatsoever, by Preaching, or by
making Church Canons, is not hence proved by no light of nature, or Law of
Nations, in an ecclesiastical care of Religion due to the Christian Prince,
but only in a politic and civil way.

4. All believers, even private men, may judge of Religion, not only by a
judgment of apprehension, but also of discretion, to try what Object.
Religion is true, and to be holden, and what is false, and to be rejected.
Ergo, far more may the Christian Magistrate definitively judge of Religion,
so he do it by convenient means, such as are sound and holy Divines, and the
rule of Gods word. The consequence is proved, because the faithful Prince has
supreme power, which is n^mothetick, and a power to make Laws.

Answer: it is true, all private believers may try the Spirits, whether they be
of God or not: but hence we may as well conclude, therefore Princes may preach
and administer the Sacraments, as therefore the Prince may define matters
ecclesiastical. For a eivill coactive power gives to no man an
ecclesiastical power, except he be called thereunto, as Aaron was. 2. The
means alleged are the judgment of holy and pious Divines, and the word of
God, but Moses whom they allege for a pattern of a civil ruler, who had a
nomothetick power in Church matters, used not the advice of Divines, nor the
rule of the written word, but as a Prophet immediately inspired of God, gave
Laws to Gods people, and prescribed a Law to Aaren, and to the Priesthood.
Now if rulers have such a power of defining Laws, they need not follow the
rule of Gods word. But how shall they prove that Moses gave the Law to the
people and the Priesthood, as a King, and not as the Prophet of God, inspired
immediately of God? For if Moses his Law came from the ordinary power of Kings,
as it is such, then comes Moses Law from a Spirit which may err, for the
ordinary Spirit to Kings, is not infallible, but with reverence to Kings,
obnoxious to erring. God save our King.

5. It is a Princes part by office to defend Religion, and to banish false
Religion, and to root out blasphemies and heresies. Ergo, he ought Object.
to know and judge by his office of all these. But if he be to use the sword at
the nodde only of the Church, without knowledge or judgment, he is the
executioner and lictor of the Church, not a civil Judge.

Answ. In a Church right constitute, we are to suppone, that the Laws of
Synods are necessary and edificative, and that the Magistrate is obliged by his
office to add his sanction to them not by an unfolded faith, and as blind; but
he is to try them, not only by the judgment of discretion, as a Christian,
(for so all Christians are to try them) but also (saving the judgment of some
Learned) by a judicial cognition, as he tries civil crimes, which he is to
punish: but his judicial cognition is only in relation to his practice, as a
Judge, to authorize these Laws, with his coactive power, not to determine
truth in an ecclesiastical way, under the pain of Church censures. Neither
do I believe, that the Magistrate is not subordinate to the Kingdom of
Christ, as mediator, but subordinate to God as Creator only. Though some
Divines teach, that there should have been Kings and supreme Powers in the
world, though man had never fallen in sin, and a Savior had never been in
the World, and so that Kings are warranted by the Law of nature, and Nations,
and not by any Law evangelick and mediatory: yet we think with reverence, this
argument not strong, for generation and creation and multiplication of mankind
should have been in the World, though never a sinner nor a Savior thould have
been in the world, yet are creation, generation and multiplication of mankind,
by our divines, Junius, Trekatius, Gomaras, Calvin, Beza, Melancthon, Polanus,
Rollocus, and many others, and with warrant of the word of God, made means
subordinate to the execution of the decree of prede^tination to Glory, which
decree is executed in Christ, as the mean and meritorious cause of salvation
purchased in his blood. What heathen Magistrates as Magistrates know not Christ
the Mediator; Ergo, they are not means subordinate to Christ's Mediatory
Kingdom. It follows not. For by Christ the wisdom of God, Kings do
reign, though many of them know him not. As they are created by Christ, as the
second person of the Trinity, though they know not the second person of the
Trinity. It is their sin that they know him not.

2. It is objected. The Magistrate is not given to the Church under the New
Testament, by the calling of Christ, as an exalted Savior, as all the gifts
instituted for the government of the mediatory Kingdom are instituted for that
end, Ephesians. 4. 11. but it is instituted by God, as governer of the World,
rewarding good and ill, Romans 13. 1.

6. Answ. Neither is creation a gift of Christ as exalted mediator, therefore
it is not a mean leading to the possession of that life purchased by the
mediators blood, it follows not. For the Magistracy is a nurse-father of the
redeemed spouse of Christ with the sincere milk of the word. I mean a formal
mean procuring, by a coactive power, that the Church shall be fed, and it
procures not only the Churches peace, which respects the second Table of
the Law, but also godliness, which respects the first Table of the Law, 1 Timothy 2. 2. and Ephesians. 4. 11. there be reckoned down only officers, which
actibus elicitis, by formal elicit acts, procures the intended end of Christ's
mediatory Kingdom. Not all the offices which procures edification any way.
Such as is in civil Governors, who are to see that the body of Christ be
nourished, and grow in godliness, for that is an essential and specific act
of the Churches nurs-father.

3. It is objected. Magistracy compels men to the observance of Gods Law,
Deuteronomy. 17. and does not immediately, of it self, by spiritual gifts of the
evangell, produ^e its effects. But all the mediatory Kingdom of Christ and the
Government thereof, of its self and its own nature, produces the saving
effects of the evangel^, by virtue of its institution, as faith, repentance,
and salvation.

Answ. A Magistracy as a Magistracy, of it self concurreth, but in a coactive
way, for producing of peace, honesty, and godliness, and serves to
edification: but I grant, not in such a spiritual way, as a Church-ministry,
therefore it is not a mean subservient to the end of Christ's mediatory
Kingdom. It follows not. It is not a spiritual mean. Ergo, it is not a
mean. The consequence is null, and it is false, that all the means of Christ's
mediatory Kingdom are of their own nature spiritual, for that is to beg
the question, for the Magistrate procures that the Church be fed, he punishes
blasphemers, that others may fear, and so abstain, and so be edified, though
the way be coactive, yet is it a way and mean appointed of God, as the
nurse-father is a mean for the child's nourishing, though the nurse-breasts be
a more subordinate mean, immediate mean.

4. It is objected. The Magistrate is not the Lords Ambassador and minister in
name of the Mediator Christ, as the Minister is, but it is extron ^call to the
government of Christ's Mediatory Kingdom, and (...) help only to those
things, which concern the external man.

Answ. He who is called God, and so is the vicegerent of God, is Gods
Ambassador politic commanding in Gods name, but in another way then a
preaching Ambassador commands: and though Christ as Mediator, may attain to
his end without the King, as many were edified in the Apostolic Church where
the civil Magistrate contributed no help, and was rather an enemy to the
kingdom of Christ, and so Magistracy may be called accidental to Christ's
mediatory government: but if this be a good argument to prove that Magistracy
is not subordinate to Christ's mediatory kingdom, then Oecumenicall and
provincial Synods consisting only of Church men shall be no means
subordinate to Christ's kingdom, because Christ's kingdom may subsist in one
Congregation, without a provincial assembly, and circumcision is no mean
subordinate to that kingdom in the Jewish Church, because that mediatory
kingdom substisted forty years in the Jewish Church in the Wilderness
without circumcision; yea and Apostles and Evangelists are no means
subordinate to that kingdom, because Christ's mediatory kingdom subsisteth now
without these officers. 2. Neither is it true that magistracy conferreth no
help to this kingdom, but in these things which concern the external man,
for in a politic and coactive way, the Magistracy takes care by
commandments, that the Church be fed with the pure Word of God; only this
proves that magistracy, and Church ministry have two different objects, and
the way of proceeding of these two states, the one carnal and with the sword,
Joh. 18. 36. Romans 13. 3, 4. the other spiritual, to the manifestarion of the
truth to the conscience, 2 Cor. 4. 1, 2. Psalm. 110. 1. 2. Es^y 11. 4. Heb. 4.
12. which we grant to be true.

5. It is objected, Christ himself performed all the parts of his mediatory
kingdom, and all the functions thereof, in his own person, and by his
disciples, while he was on earth; but he refused all civil Magistracy, and
did inhibit his disciples thereof, because it is not contained under the
administration of his mediatory office, as subordinate thereunto.

Answ. Christ refused magistracy, not because it is not subordinate to
edification, which is the end of Christ's mediatory kingdom, but because it is
not compatible with his spiritual kingdom, in one and the same person, and
therefore this is a caption, a non causa pro causa, in one and the same person
and subject; the civil and the Ecclesiastical power are inconsistent and
incompatible, that is true. Ergo, in the kind of lawful means these two
powers are unconsistent and uncompatible. I deny it to follow, for both royal
power and Church power concur for the producing of one and the same end, to
wit, edification and obedience to both Tables of the Law, but after different
ways, carnal and spiritual. Note.
I think it most considerable that though the Prince may by a coactive way,
command that same which a Church Synod may command in an ecclesiastical way,
yet differs these same powers in their formal objects, because the King
commands that which is good, religious, decent in Gods worship as a thing
already taught and determined judicially, either expressly in Gods Word, or
then by a pastoral or Synodicall determination, and that not by way of
teaching, informing the mind, exponing the Scripture, or by pastoral dealing
with the conscience, as oblieging to a Church Liturgy, and ceremonies, as one
who intends formal edification and faith, repentance, and obedience to God;
but the King commands that which is good and extra, as it is already taught,
and expounded, and as it is an imperated act of external worship, or mercy and
justice done by a coactive power.

Hence the Magistrates power is not to edify formally, but to procure that
edification may be. 2. The Magistrates power is Lordly, the Churches power is
only ministerial. 3. The Magistrates power may be in one, to wit, in the
King, the Churches power of the keys is in the Church. 4. They differ in
formal objects, as has been said.

Now to obviate what the Jesuit Lysimachus Nicanor says, we are no ways of
Papists mind in the matter of the Magistrates power, for Papists, 1. exclude
Kings and Emperors from any meddling with Church matters. Charles the fifth was
upbraided by Paul the third, the Pope of Rome, because he did, as became a
Prince, ordain meetings, conferences, and assemblies for composing of
differences in Churches matters, not giving the power of conveening counsels,
only to the Pope, Later ^ Pauli 3. ad Carol. 5. imperatorem. apud Wolsium tom.
^. Lect. memor. page 5^9.
comparing his fact to the attempt of Uzzah, who put his hand to the Ark, and
to C^rah, Dathan and Abirams conspiracy against Moses; yea and Nicol. 1 in
Epist. ad Mi^ha. Impera. C. ul^ na^n did 96.
Nicolaus the first in his Epistle to Michael the Emperor, denies that
Emperors are to be present in Synods, except in general Synods, where both
Church men and laics are present: we teach that the Magistrate is as the
hand, the ministry as the eyes, and both are to concur for the spiritual
good of the body of Christ.

2. Papists will have the Magistrates so to defend the faith, as they have not
power to judge, not as Christians with the judgment of descretion what is
right, or wrong, but they must, as blind servants, execute what Prelates
decree, yea and see (non pr^priis (says Henric. Blyssemius tract. de Eccles p.
37.
Henr. Blyssemius) sed alienis Episcoporum ac p^aelatorum suorum oculis videre)
not with their own eyes, but with the eyes of their Prelates, yea and the
Magistrate should not read the Scripture, (say Papists and Nican^rs brethren
the Jesuits) expressly contrary to Gods Word, Deuteronomy. 17. 17. He shall read in
the book of the Law, all the days of his life, Joshua 1. 8. but only believe
as the Church believes, and this is blind obedience that they require of
Princes; this faith or obedience we think abominable in all men, as in
Princes.

Of old, Popes and Prelates were subject to Kings and Emperors, as we teach
from the Word of God, Romans 13. 1. and 1. we teach against the Jesuit
Lysimachus Nicanor, that his Prelates should not invade the King and civil
Magistrates sword, and be civil Judges, as Popes and Prelates are; against
which writes Tertullian de idol. c. 8. Christus gloriam seculi and sibi and
sais alienam esse judicavit.
Tertullian, Origin homil. 12. in Matthew.

Augustinus; The Survey of discipline, cap. 23. page 280, 281.
author of the Survey says, that if every Eldership be the tribunal seat of
Christ, what appellation can be made there from to either provincial or
general council? and he means, that there can be no appellation to the
King, seeing the Presbytery in Churches causes is as immediately subject to
Jesus Christ, and the highest Judicature on earth, as the King is Gods
immediate vicegerent on earth, nearest to Jesus Christ, in civil causes.

I answer: the cause that is merely ecclesiastical, as the formal act of
preaching and ecclesiastical determining of truth in Pulpits, and the
determining the truth in Church assemblies, in an ecclesiastical way in
Synods, and the excommunicating of a scandalous person, are immediately subject
to Jesus Christ, speaking in his own perfect Testament: and these causes lie
not at the feet of Princes to be determined by them, as Kings, but in a
constitute Church they are to be determined by the ordinary Church assemblies,
and in this place there is no appeal from the Presbytery to a King; but it
follows not, that there can be no appellation from a Presbytery to a
provincial, or to a national assembly; 1. Because though every Presbytery be
the tribunal seat of Christ, yet it is but a part of the tribunal seat of
Christ, and such a part as may easily err, and therefore appellation may be
made from the weaker, and the part more inclined to err, to the stronger and
maniest, or the whole, who may more hardlier err: and that is not denied by
this author, who dare not deny, but they may appeal from a Bishop who does, and
may misleade souls, and empty purses, to a Metropolitan, and an Archbishop,
who is as dexterous and happy in emptying of poor men's purses, and destroying
souls, if not large better, as a petty Lord Prelate, from whom he appealed;
yet is the one Lord Prelate the Vicar of Christ, as well as the other, by
formalists books. And, 2. If the cause be proper to the Presbytery, they have
just right to judge it, as well as the provincial assembly has, but possibly
not such knowledge, and if the party complain that he is wronged, or may be
wronged, he may well appeal to a larger part of Christ's tribunal, less
obnoxious to erring, which is no wrong done to the Presbytery. This man
labors to make a division amongst our Divines, because we know not whether
to make our Pastors, Doctors, and Elders immediate(...) to Christ, as Priests,
because then they are Priests of the New Testament, or ^ubject to Christ, as
King, and then all our officers shall (...) Kings, under Christ, and the
Christian M^gistrate shall be so thrust out of his kingdom and chair. And the
ignorant railer makes much ado in this matter, but the truth is stronger then
this Popish scribler; for 1. as Christ is a Priest having a body to offer for
the sins of the people, and a real Sacrifice, our Divines deny that Christ
has any substitute and demie Priests under him, or master Priests to offer
sacrifices real to God: if this Author put any Priests under Christ in this
meaning, he is upon an unbloody Masse-sacrifice, much good do it him; if

are to bless God that these Officers, Pastors, Doctors, Elders and Deacons
are expressly in the Word of God, and that this railers officers, to wit,
Bishops, Archbishops, Metropolitans, Primats, Deanes, Archdeanes, officials,
etc. are in no place of Christ's testament, only they are in the Popes Mass
book: now if the man offend, because they are subordinate to Christ as King,
he must make his Primates, his Metropolitans, his Diocesan Lords, his Deans,
Officials, and such wild Officers, Emperors, Kings, Dukes and Lord Treasurers
under Christ, for some room these creatures must have, else they must be put
out at the Church doors, and if a man be injured by the Primate, to whom shall
he appeal, but to some above him, a Cardinal? and if that creature be a
Christ, who cannot do wrong, well and good it is, we rest, but if he be a
man like the rest of the world, surely poor folk must appeal to his high
holiness the Pope. 2. Deacons are not men of ecclesiastic authority in our
account, but are to serve tables, Acts 6. 3. nor are our officers little Kings
under Christ, (for the man cannot hold of the sent of a Lord Bishop) but mere
ministers and servants, and the Ambassadors of the King of Kings, who have no
power to make laws, as if they were little Kings, but are to propound Christ's
laws; he is ignorant of Christ's kingdom, for the officers of the New
Testament are under Christ as their King; Ergo, they are under him as little
deputy Kings to make Laws, as Judges earthly are under those whose kingdom
is of this world, Joh. 18. 36. the man is both beside his book, and his wit,
to infer this; Christ has no Popes nor visible substitute Kings under him, but
under him are mere servants and heralds.

4. We are far from holding, that one Church man such as the Pope may
excommunicate Kings; Gregorius the second excommunicated the Emperor Leo, and
Gregorius the seventh, alias wicked Hildebrand, excommunicated Henry the
fourth; Christ has committed the power of excommunication to the whole Church,
1 Cor. 5. 4. Matthew. 18. 17, 18. and therefore Lysimachus Nicanor cannot but
side with Papists in laying this power upon one Prelate, as the Kings
substitute, or rather the Popes Vicar.

5. We do not teach that the Pope or any Church man may dethrone Kings, and
alienate their crowns to others. Gregory the first in a certain decree says,
Kings and Judges, who contr^veneth the constitution of the Sea of Rome, are to
be deprived of her honor; Gregory the second having excommunicated the
Emperor Leo, discharged the Italians to pay him tribute, and that because Leo
was against the worshipping of Images; See Haiminsfieldius (...)
Haiminsfieldius, and Arniseus de (...).

of the kingdom of Italy, per sanctissimum diabolum, by a most holy devil:

kingdom, and procured that Pipinus the father of Charles the great, should be
created King, so says Baleus, 16.
Baleus also.

Let the third transferred the Empire from the Grecians to the Romans, and by
the hand of Pope Leo (says Sigebertus) Charles was crowned; See for this (...)
Shardius in (...). Go^stad par. 4. page 296.
Shardius. Gregorius the fifth being the brother germane of Otbo the Emperor,
made a Law that the Emperor should be chosen by seven Princes electors, which
fact weakened the majesty of the Empire, which went before by inheritance,
hence An. 1350. Charles the fourth, that his son might succeed him in the
Empire, laid in pledge the free Cities of the Empire, in the hands of the
Prince electors, which to this day are not redeemed. So did the Pope shake the
Empire, at his own will. Gregory the third began, and Leo the third finished
the devise of erecting a new Empire in the West, and weakened the power of the
Emperor of Constantinople.

Gregorius the seventh, alias graceless Hildebrand, deprived Henry the fourth,
and created another in his place, as Sleidan peri^d. 5. c 8.

Constan^^^^ gave to the Popes of Rome freedom and immunity from the imperial
Laws, and that he gave to the Pope the territories of Rome, and the City of
Rome the Seat of the Empire to be Peter the fishers patrimony, and this (say
they) Constantine gave to Silvester, which is the Patrimony of the Crown, and
the very Empire it self given to Peter, we teach no such Kingly power given to
Churchmen, and judge this donation to be a forged lie, invented by Papists,
because they are their own witnesses of this donation. For Hieronymus Pa^^us
in (...) qui (...) pract^^^^ ^^c^llariae Ap (...).
Hieronymus Pa^^^us Cath^lanus, a Lawyer, and Chamberlain to Pope Alexand^r

nothing of this donation, as neither Eusebius, nor Hieronymus, nor Augustine,
nor A^brase, nor Basilius, nor Chrysostom, nor Ammianus, nor Histeri^ T^ip
^^tita, nor Pope Damasus in his Chronicle, nor Beda, nor Oros^us, it is but a
dream, yet it is certain that three hundredth veares after Constantine the
Emperors kept Rome, and the Towns of Italy, by their presidents and

writes to Lotharius the Emperor, that they will keep the Emperors Laws for
ever, and that they are liars who say the contrary. Arcadius made a Law, that
if a Priest were found to be seditious and troubling the public peace, he
should be banished an hundred miles from that place. But how far Popes have
surpassed bounds in these; see their blasphemies. As they say Clement. Pastor

that to the Pope is given all power in heaven and in earth.

that a Jesuit stabbe or poison a King, when he turns enemy to the Roman

CHAP. 7. SECT. 1.
Of the way of Reformation of the Congregations of England. The way of the
Churches of Christ in New England.

IN the first article, the Author acknowledges the Church of England was once
rightly, and orderly gathered, either by Apostles ^^ apostolic men, whether
Philip, or Joseph of Arimathea, or Simon Zelotes, as we may read in Fox, etc.
Sothat all the work now, is not to make them Churches which were none before,
but to reduce and restore them to their primitive institution.

Answ. Though the Churches of England were planted by the Apostles, yet since
Popery universally afterward prevailed, in both England and Scotland, as Beda
and Nicephorus and ancient histories witness, we think by our brethrens
grounds England losed the very essence of a true Church. So that there be need
of the constituting of a new Church, and not of simple restitution to the first
restitution. 1. Because the Congregations wants the essential constitution
of right visible Churches, as you say. 2. Because you receive none coming from
the Church of New England, to the seals of the Covenant, because they are
members of no visible Church.

Sect. 2. Certain propositions tending to Reformation.
In the third or fourth Proposition the Author condemns Laics Patronages.

2. Dedicating of Lands to the Ministry; to these add what the Ministers of
New England say Answer to the 26. Question.
in their answer to the thirty two Questions sent to them from Old-England,
where they condemn stinted maintenance. Though the right of Church Patronages
were derived from Romulus, it is not for that of noble blood. ^or Dionys.
Halicarnass. l. 2 antiquit. optiene cuiquam ex ^ulgo data, ut que^n vellent
sibi pa^^onu^n el^ge^ent
Dionysius Halicarnasseus says Romulus instituted Patronages, when he had
divided the people in noble and ignoble, called, Patricii and Plebeii. But this
Patronage was civil, and when servants and underlings were hardly used, it
has a ground in nature, that they choose Patrons to defend them, therefore he
who gave liberty to a a servant, amongst the Romans was called a Patron, and
Terentius in Eunu^ho^e mi^^ Patronum cupie. I ^a^.
he who defended the cause of the accused, as Valla says, was called a Patron.
If it be said that the servant was the proper goods, and part of the Masters
patrimony, because he might sell his servant, and therefore there could be no
Law given to prove men may limit the dominion of the master over the servant.

I answer; the servant was a part of his masters patrimony, but a part thereof
for sin, not as his Ox or his Ass, is a part of his patrimony; therefore by
the Law of nature, whereby the weaker imploreth help of the stronger, as the
Lamb seeks help from the mother, and the young Eagle from the old, the
slave might well have liberty to choose a Patron, and this is a ground that
the Magistrate the Churches nurs-father by office should plead the Churches
cause, as her Patron, and every one in power is to defend the Church in her
liberties and patrimony; and therefore in the Apostles time, when holiness and
the power of Religion did flourish, and was in court, there was not need of any
positive, civil or Church Law, for a Patron to the Church, every believer in
power is obliged to defend the Church: but when men became Vulturs and
ravenous birds to pluck from the Church what was given them, the Council of
Millian Concilium Melevitanu^n ^n. 402.
in the year of God 402. wherein some say Augustine was president, under
Honorius and Arcadius, some holy and powerful men were sought from the
Emperor to defend the Church in her patrimony, and rights against the power
and craft of avaritious men, and they were called Patrons, and the same was
desired Concilium Car^bagin. 5. c. 9. an. 420.
in the first Council of Carthage, but with the Bishops advice, cum provisione
Episcoporum. Hence it is clear, patronages from their original were not
Church privileges, and Bishops being a part of the Church, could not be the
Patrons, quia nemo sibi ipsi potest esse patronus, and for this cause that
learned Hosp^nian de orig. te^nplo. to. 4. de orig. honor. eccles. c. 6.
thinks this was the original of Church Patronages, but the Patrons have
been chosen with consent of the Church; hence they were not as our Patronages
are now, which goes 1. by birth, 2. and are a part of a man's patrimony, and
civil thing, that the Patron has right unto, under the Kings great Seal; but
as a Minister is not a Minister by birth, neither was a Patron a Patron by
birth: and from this we may collect, that the Patrons right was but a branch
of the Magistrates right, and accumulative, not primitive, and that he could
take nothing from the Church, and (...) less might the Patron forestall the
free election of the people, by tying them and their free suff^ages to a
determinate man, whom he presented; and it is not unlike which A^entinus in
(...). 6. a^al.
A^entinus (...), when Bishops gave themselves only to the Word of God, to
preaching and writing books in defense of the truth, the Emperor took care
that they should be furnished with food and ^aiment, and therefore gave them a
p^tronus quem (...) patronum curatoremque vocabant, whom they called a patron;
and here observe the Bishop of old was the client, and the son and Pupil,
now he must be the Patron and Tutor, and therefore in time of Popery,
Antichristian Prelates would be Patrons both to themselves and to the Churches.

But this seems not to be the original of patronages, because this ground
is common to all Churches, but not all, but only some certain Churches have
patronages, therefore their ground seems rather to be that some religious
and pious persons founded Churches, and dotted, and mortified to them
benefices, and the Church by the Law of gratitude did give a Pat^onage over
these founded Churches to the first foundators and their heirs, so as they
should have power to nominate and present a Pastor to the Church. But there
were two notable wrongs in this; for 1. If the fundator have all the Lands and
Rents in those bounds, where the Church was erected, he is obliged to erect a
Church, and furnish a ^^pend, both by the Law of nature and so by Gods Law
also. Ergo, the Church owe to him no gift of patronage for that, nor is he to
keep that patronage in his hand, when he erecteth a Church; but and if he
being Lord heritor of all the Lands and Rents, both erecteth a Church, and
dotteth a stipend, sub modum eleemosynae, non sub modum debiti, by way of
alms, not by way of debt, then is there no gratuitie of honor, nor reward of
Patronage due to him, for alms as alms has no real or bodily reward to be
given by those on whom the alms is bestowed, but only the blessings of the
poor, Joh 31. 20. it being a debt paid to God, he does requite it. And
Fdvar. Dido. lav. in (...). p. 591.
Calderword says, no wise man would think that the Church men should allure
men to found Churches, and to works of Piety, by giving them the right of
presenting a man to the change: and also he would call it Simonie, not piety
or religion, if one should refuse to do a good work to the Church, except
upon so deare^t rate, and so hard a condition as to acquire to himself po^er
over the Church of God.

Though the ^ight of presenting a man to benefice were a mere temporal thing,
yet because it removes the liberty of a free election of the fittest pastor,
as Origin. (...) 6. in Levit. is eligendus ex omni populo qui praestantior, qui
doct^^, qui sanctier.
Origin says, it cannot be lawful, but it is not a temporal or civil
right, but a spiritual right, though we should grant that the people have a
free voice in choosing, and that the patron were obliged to present to the
benefice, the man only whom the people has freely chosen, and whom the
Elders, by imposition of hands, have ordained. 1. Because the Pastors has
right to the benefice, as the workman is worthy of his hire, and he has a
divine right thereunto by Gods Law, 1 Cor. 9. 8, 9. and c. Gal. 6 6. Matthew. 10.
10. Ergo, if the patron give any right to the Pastor to the benefice, it must
be a spiritual right. If it be said, he may give him a civil right before
men, that according to the Laws of the Commonwealth, he may legally brook and
enjoy the benefice; this is but a shift, for the civil right before men is
essentially founded upon the Law of God, that says, the workman is worthy of
his hire: and it is that fame right really that the Word of God speaks of:
now by no Word of God, has the Patron a power to put the Preacher in that
case, that he shall be worthy of his wages, for he being called, chosen as
Pastor, he has this spiritual right not of one, but of the whole Church. 2.
It is true, Papists seem to be divided in judgments in this, whether the
right of patronage be a temporal or a spiritual power; for some Canonists as
we may see Abb. decius and
in Abb. decius, Rubi. in c. Quanto de jud. and in d. ca. de (...).
and Rubio, and the Gloss Glossa in c. piae menus 16. q. 7.
says it is partly temporal, partly spiritual. Others say it is a spiritual
power, as Anton de Butr. and
Anton. de Butr. and Andr. Barbat. in d. c. Quando.
Andr. Barbat. and F^ancis. Suarez (...) and Statu (...) 4 de (...) 8 ^ 5.
Suarez, and whereas Papists do teach that the Church may lawfully give a
right of presenting to Church benefices, even to those who are not Church men,
the power must be ecclesiastical and spiritual, and cannot be temporal;
also Suarez says, that the right of patronage may be the matter of Sim^ny,
when it is ^^ld for m^ney. Ergo, they think it an holy and spiritual power.
It is true Man. An (...) Spalate^ de (...). 3. page 9^9.
the Bishop of Spalato calls it a temporal power, which is in the hand of
the Prince, but there is neither reason nor Law, why it can be called a
temporal power due to a man, seeing the patron has (amongst us) a power to
present, and name one man, whom he conceives to be qualified, for we find the
nomination of a list, or the seeking out of men fit for the holy ministry, some
times ascribed to the Church, as Act. 1 23. Then they appointed two, Joseph
called Barsabas, who was surnam d Jus^us, and Matthias, which words may well
be referred to the eleven Apostles, and so they nominated men, or to the
Church of believers, and so though it be not an authoritative action, it is an
ecclesiastical action, and belongs to the Church as the Church, and so to no
Patron: and the looking out of seven men to be presented as fit to be ordained
Deacons, is expressly given to the Church of believers, Act. 6. 3. Wherefore
Brethren, look ye out amongst you, (...), seven men of honest report; and
sometimes the Apostles do nominate men for the ministry, but never does the
holy Ghost mention a Patron. But if the thing it self (say they) he
necessary, then is the office not unlawful.

But it is most necessary that some one or more eminent and powerful men,
should have power to see that the Church goods be not delapidated.

Answ. It is a part of the Magistrates office, with his accumulative power,
whereby he sees that every one do their duty, to take care that vulturs and
sacrilegious devourers of Church livings be punished; and the Church
themselves are to censure all guilty of Simony or delapidation of the rents of
the Church, as may be gathered by due analogy from Peter's punishing with
death, the sacrilege of Ananias and Saphira, and the Simony of Simon Magus. 2.
The ancient Church ^ooke care of dividing of the Church rent very carefully in
four parts; one was given to the Pastor, who was not to employ ^ents of the
Church upon Horses and Coaches, and conquering Baronies and Lordships to their
sons, as our idle belleys were in custom to do, but the Bishop was to
entertain Hospitalls, and to feed the poor, to take care of bridges, rep^ring
of Churches, so as A^brosius l. ^. epist. ^^. epist. ^^. (...), quod pa^peru ^^
^ ^ est.
Ambrose says, what ever is the Biships, it is the poores; a second part was
given to the Elders and Deacons; a third part was for the repairing of
Churches, and a fourth part for Hospitalls, for poor and strangers; this
distribution with some other order, is made, if we believe Papists, Sy^ol 3.
(...) 1. c 4.
in a Synod at Rome under Silvester the first, though Socrates, Theodoret,
Sozomen, and others well versed in antiquity speak nothing of this Synod, but
you may see this clear in Synod. Braca^ens. ^ c. 25.
Synodo Bracarensi, in ^Span Anal. ^o. 289
Aventinus, in Gregorus (...).
Gregorius, so there is no need of a Patron, nor was there any in the
Apostolic Church. Deacons were to take care for tables, and the goods of the
poor, no reason that men seem more careful for the good of the Church then
Jesus Christ. 3. Though there be a necessity that the Church be defended in
her liberties, yet is there no reason, an office should be made thereof; as the
Canonists make it an office, with a sort of stipend; And therefore to make a
Patron they require not only the founding of a Church, but also the building
of the house, upon his own charges, and the dotation of a mainten^nce for the
Church, (...).
and for this cause the Patrou has a burial place in the Church; and if he
or his children become poor, they are to be entertained of the Church rents;
and therefore they call it jus ^uti'e, a gainefull power. 2. It is jus
b^norifioum, he has power to nominate and present a man to the benefice of
the vaiking Church. 3. It is jus onerosum, because he is obliged to defend
the Church; see the^ C^^decernimus (...). 9. 7.

eccle^^asticall to take care of his Church, for no power over the Church was
ever given to builders of Synagogues, and therefore a calling by the Patron is
no more Christ's way, then a calling by the Prelate and his Chaplain. 2. Nor
would the Church receive the ministers from Christ Jer. 2. 5. and the laying on
of the hands of the Elders, 1 Timothy 4. 14. 2 Timothy 2. 2. but by the authority of
the Patron, who does nominate the man, and may charge the Presbytery, by Law
to admit him minister of such a flock. Nor is it enough to say that the Patron
does present to such a benefit only, and does leave all the ecclesiastical
part to the Church, and the officers thereof, for this would say something, if
the Patron were tied to the Churches free choice, whereas the contrary is true,
that the Church is tied to the Patrons free election of the man, but this is
nothing, because the Patron being but one man only, and so the Church can have
no lawful propriety, right and dominion over the rents of the Church, for
Christ is only Lord and proprieter, and just titular of all rents dotted for
the maintenance of the ministry, and under Christ, when the place vaiketh, the
rents recurre to the Church, as the proper proprieter under Christ: as the
goods of Ananias and Saphira are the goods of the Church, after they had given
them in to the public treasury of the Church; Ergo, the Patron can give no
right to any person to be presented and ordained, for no man can give to
another that title and right which he has not in himself. If it be said,
he may give in the Churches name, as the Churches Patron, those goods which
are mortified to the Church, well, then is the Patron in the act of presenting
the representative Church, and has the Churches power; Ergo, he is but the
Churches servant in that, and to do at the Churches will, and the Church is
the first presenter, this is a new representative Church, that we have not
heard of.

2. This is against the nature of the Patrons office, whose it is, when he
foundeth and builds a Church, to reserve the right of patronage to himself,
and never to give that right to the Church; Ergo, by his own authority, and
not in the Churches name, he gives title to the benefice, to the Pastor of
Minister.

3. The Church has not power to alien ate and dispose to one particular man,
those goods which are given to God, and to his Church, so as that one has
power in Law to dispose those goods to any, without the Churches consent, as
the Patron may do. The Church may dispose and give power to one man to do
certain actions in the Churches name, but yet so as the Church retains power
to regulate that her delegate, or commissioner in these acts, and to correct
him, in case of aberration; but the Church has no power over the Patron as
Patron to limit him in the exercise of his power, for the right of Patronage is
his by birth, he may sell it for money to another; to a Papist, to an
excommunicate person, to a Jew, or an enemy of the Church, as he may sell his
lands and houses, and has a civil right thereunto under his Majesty's great
Seal; therefore the patron does here, proprio suo jure, by his own proper
right, present and give title and Law to the Church benesice, and does not
present in name of Church, or as having from the Church a power.

3. What ever takes away an ordinance of Christ, that is not lawful: but the
power of Patrons takes away the ordinance of Christ, and the free election of
the People, because the people have power to choose out of many one fittest,
and most qualified, for the office; as is clear, Act. 6. 3. Act. 1. v. last.
Act. 14. 23. because the man chosen should be one of a thousand, as A^^^
da^nas. page 332.
Didoclavius or Calderwood says in that learned Treatise, called Altar
Damascenum. Nor can it be said (says that learned Author) that the Church may
transfer her right of presenting to a Patron, for that is in effect to
transfer her power of election, but that (says he). the particular Church
cannot do except by the decrce of a gener all assembly, neither can that right
be transferred over to a general assembly, especially a perpetual and
hereditary right, because (as says Cartwright 2. reply, ^ part. page 226.
Cartwright) it is a part of that liberty, which is purchased by Christ's
blood, which the Church can no m^re alienate and dispose, then she can
transfer or dispose to another her inheritance of the kingdom of God, to the
which this liberty is annexed: thus he.

4. The discerning of the spirits, and the knowing of the voice of Christ
speaking in his called servants, is laid upon the flock of Christ, whose it is
to elect, but not upon the Patron, which may be a Heathen, and a Publican, and
as such is no member of the Church.

5. Every humane ordinance not warranted by Christ's Tostament, and abused to
sacrilege, rapine, delapidation of Church-rents, and Simoniacal pactions with
the intrants into the holy ministry, is to be abolished, and is unlawful:
but the right of patronages is such as experiences teaches to many and
lamentable. The proposition is above cleared.

6. That calling in part or in whole, which gives no ground of faith, and
assurance of a lawful calling to the Ministers entry to that holy charge,
cannot belawfull; but the calling to the ministry by the good will and consent
of the Patron as Patron, is such. Ergo. The proposition is clear, every
lawful mean and way of entry unto that calling is warranted by a word of
promise, or precept, or practice; the calling by the patrons consent, has
neither word of promise, or precept, or practice in the Word; and stays not
the conscience of the man of God, that he did not run unsent: but a man is
never a whit the more staid in his conscience, that he is presented by a
Patron, to the tithes, and parsonage and vicarage of such a Congregation. It is
but a cold comfort to his soul, that the Patron called him.

7. What ever privilege by the Law of nature all incorporations have to choose
their own rulers and officers, this Christ must have provided in an eminent
manner to the Church: but all cities, societies, incorporations and kingdoms
have power to choose their own rulers, officers, and members, as is clear by
an induction of all free colleges, societies, cities and republics. Ergo,
this cannot be laid upon a Patron; see for this also Amesius, de c^nscient. l.
4. c. 25 q 5. n. 23, 24.
Amesius, Gul. Ap l(...). in sac a sect. 2 c. 1. page 61, 162.

agentes. Uhille Canon ut a palatio mittatur is, qu^ sutu^ us est Epis^opus:
Ath^nasius, Where is that Canon in the Word, that the sent Minister of Christ,
is sent from the Court, or the Princes Pala^e?

As concerning the other two, this author condemns Lands dedicated to the
ministry, because the New Testament speaks nothing of such Lands.

Answ. This speaks against Glebes of Ministers, but the New Testament
speaks not of Manses or houses, or of moneys for Ministers; yet a wage we
know is due, Matthew. 10. 10. 1 Cor. 9. 8, 9, 10. Gal. 6. 6. and the Levites were
not to be distracted from the most necessary work of the Tabe^^acle, and
service of God, more then Ministers, yet they had Lands and Towns assigned of
God to them; though the less dis^ract^ous the wages be, the better, and the
more convenient they are, 2 Timothy 2. 3. 4. 5. As for the tithes we think
quotta decimarum, or a sufficient maintenance, of tithes, or what else may
conduce for food and raiment, of divine right, Matthew. 10. 16. 1 Cor. 9. 8, 9.
tithes formally as tithes are not necessary, so the Ministers be provided, and
a stipend be allowed to them, not as an alms, but as a debt, Luke 10. 7. But
the stinting of maintenance for Ministers the author condemns, because when
Constantine gave large rents to the Church, it proved the lane of the Church.

But I answer, stinting makes not this, but excess, for mountains of rents
may be stinted, no less then mole-hills.

In the first proposition Pastors are to be chosen of new, in England, though
they have been Pastors before, and that by the imposition of the hands of some
gracious and godly Christians.

Answ. Such an ordination wants all warrant in the Word of God. 2. Why are
they ordained over again, who were once ordained already? belike you count
them not Ministers, and baptism administered by them, no baptism, though these
same gracious Christians have been baptized by such, and so England has no
Church visible at all, and no ministry; see what you lay upon Luther and some
of our first reformers, who had their external calling from Antichristian
Prelates, the same very thing which Papists lay upon them. 3. If there be
called Pastors in England to lay on hands on Ministers, why are not they to
impose hands on such as you judge to be no ministers? because possibly the
Prelates laid hands upon them, seeing you grant Chap. 5. Sect. 9. where there
are Presbyters to lay on hands, it is convenient that ordination should be
performed by them. I confess I am not much for the honoring of the Prelates
foul fingers, yet can they not be called no Pastors, no more then in right
we can say, Caiaphas was no High Priest.

Proposition 6. He wills Pastors, and Doctors, and Elders to be put in the
^^^me of Parsons and Vicars.

Answ. If the offices of Parson and Vicar be set up, it is reason they be
abolished, but for the names there is not much necessity of contending, though
in such cases it be safer to speak with the Scripture, then with Papists: the
Vicar General is indeed the Bishops delegat, and a creature to be banished
out of the house of God, of whose unprofitable place and style, see that
learned writer Alta^ da^^^. par. 458.
D^^id Calderwood, who finds him to be made of the metal of the Popes
service, base Copper not Gold. (...)
and the Popish parson is as the Vicar; Firewood for Antichrists Caldron.

In the 12. and 13. Propositions, it is said, that it is necessary (...)
Preachers countenanced from King, and State, were sent to (...) to
congregations generally ignorant, and profane, and till they (...) measure of
gracious reformation, as they can testify their faith and repentance, it were
meet they should never renew their C^^^nant made in baptism, nor yet have the
Seals of the Covenant con^^^ed upon them, but till then they shall lament
after the Lord, as the (...) did when the Arc had been long absent, 1 Samuel 7.
2.

Answ. In these Propositions most of all the Congregations of England, except
some few following the way of independencie of Church government, though they
be baptized and profess the truth, are brought just to the state of Turks
and Indians willing to hear the Word, or of excommunicated persons, for they
and their seed are to want the Scales, their children Bapti^me, themselves the
Lords Supper. But 1. how can the (...) in ordinary rebukes, and excommunication
from the S^al^ be exercised upon these who are without, and no Church as yet?
for while they swear the Covenant, they are not Churches. 2. It is said, godly
Preachers must be sent to them, (...) they (...) reformed; but why not godly
Pastors? because th^ugh these preachers preach unto them, yet exercise they no
Pastoral care over them, because they are not yet a visible Church and flock,
and therefore have no more Pastors to care for their souls, then Turks and
Indians, and Preachers have (...) a Pastoral relation to these, though
baptized, and (...) Christ, then to Indians, Jews or Turks, as our brethren
teach, and a pattern of such flocks is not hard in the word, where ordinarily
the word is preached to a number of people baptized, and yet baptism denied to
all their seed, and the Lords Supper to themselves. 3. It is the same Covenant
the author speaks of here with the Church Covenant that (...) and Judah made
with God, and which they say essentially constituteth a Church, and hinteth at
the Covenant of the Church of Scotland, sworn and subscribed by many thousands
ign^rant and profane, and who never came to such a measure of gracious
reformation, as they can testify their faith and repentance; yet did this
nation right in putting all to swear and enter into a Covenant with God, for
Israel, Deuteronomy. 29. where there was many who had not eyes to see, ears to hear,
and a heart to understand, v. 3. 4. and where there were many rebellious and
stiff-hearted, Deuteronomy. 31. 27. entered all of them into Covenant with God,
Captains, Elders, Officers, all the men of Israel, Deuteronomy. 29. v. 10. Little
ones, wives, children, hewers of wood, etc. all which attained not to such a
measure of gracious reformation. 2 Chronicles. 15. 9. all Judah and Benjamin, and
the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon, entered
into a Covenant with God; who after such Apostasy could not all have attained
to that measure of gracious reformation, as to testify their faith and
repentance by prayer, conference, experiences of Gods ways in their heart and
confession, and yet the Author says Chap. 1. Sect. 1.
that there is no color to conceive this way of entering into Church estate by
Covenant, to be peculiar to the pedagogue of the Old Testament. 4. Isreal's
lamenting after the Lord, 1 Samuel 7. 2. was not the repentance of a people, who
was not a Church visible, but was only a people to be prepared for a Church
State, and not fit to receive circumcision and the passoever; as you conceive
of the ignorant and profane in England, which to you are no visible Churches;
for Israel at this time was a true visible Church. The rest of the propositions
tending to reformation not discussed elsewhere, I acknowledge to be gracious
and holy counsels, meet for a reformation. The Lord build his own Temple in
that Land, and fill it with the cloud of his glory.

FINIS.
