ON THE Relief of VIENNA, A HYMN for the True-Protestants.
I.
Renowned be Christian Arms,
The Turkish Whigs be damned,
And lousy Holwel in their Head,
Who our blue Saints has shamm'd.
II.
These are your precious Rogues!
Rather than not Rebel
Against their Lawful Prince, and God,
They Will join the Devil of Hell.
III.
These are your True-blue-men,
Who Persecution cry,
When They, with Julian their old Friend,
The Christian God defy!
IV.
But He has found an Arm
To do the Royal Work,
And vindicate Himself, against
True-Protestant and Turk.
V.
'Twas a true Christian Prince
That made 'em know His pleasure,
And taught the Villains what is due
Both to their GOD and CAESAR.
VI.
God bless our good King CHARLES,
And JAMES, His own dear Brother;
And may They Both live long, live long,
To Succor one another.
VII.
God bless the King of Poland too,
And every Christian KING;
The Name is Sacred; Hang the Dogs
Who do not love the Thing.
Printed for C. W. Anno Domini 1683.
