A PASTORAL.
Tomalin, Welcome Great Man! But stay, I hear
Some of my fellow-Swains draw near,
With them I Will mingle Joys, and We
(With Shepherds Art, and Melody)
Will join to sing his Praise, and make
The neighboring Woods and Groves partake.
What makes you now so dull? behold, the Sun
Is halfway up the Hill of Heaven run.
Is this a time to lagg, when all the Plain
Does echo with the God-like Shepherds name?
The Brisk, the Noble Damon's, who does cheer
Each Shepherds heart, and glad our Hemisphere.

Willie, Oh Tomalin! you cannot believe
With what glad heart I did receive
The happy News No sound did ever
Unto my ravished ears more welcome bear:
The bravest Youth that ever took
Into his hand a Spear or Crook.
Oh, with what Pride (methinks) I see,
What Noble God-like Gallantry,
He walks, and traces o'r the Plain,
While every wondering Rural Swain
With willing heart does homage pay,
And at his feet their humble Offerings lay.

Hobbinol, All this, my Tomalin, is true;
But what is the cause Him hither drew?
Was it to show His comely Grace,
Or Noble Form, or Manly Face;
Or how to dance it o'r the Lays,
On Summer-nights and Holy Days;
Or with his Oaten-pipe and Quill,
With artful Swains to try his Skill?
No; 'Twas the charming SYLVIA drew the Swain,
The Crown and Glory of the Plain,
Like Roses blushing, and more fair
Than Down of Swans, or Lillies are:
Great Natures best! more brisk and gay
Than bright Aurora, or the Day.
Had Paris seen Her, without doubt
Sh'ad merited the Golden Fruit,
And those fair Goddesses had been
But Dowdies to our Rural Queen.

Tomalin, No Shepherdess was ever yet
Like Her so Nobly Good and Great;
No Beauty but to her would yield,
She is the Goddess of the Field:
How many Garlands have I seen
Presented Her upon the Green!
And with what awful Fear and Love
Each Swain who most should serve her strove!
No Madrigal or Sonnet ever
Was sung, but still in Praise of Her,
Nor Oaten-pipe was ever made,
But to delight her in the Shade;
All that the Shepherds Wit or Skill
Could do, was done to please her still.

Willie, This is a happy day indeed!
Let Us leave our Flocks alone to feed,
And join our homely Rural Lays,
To welcome HIM, and sing HER praise.

Hobbinol, Happy! In truth you well may say
It is the happiest happy day;
We shall not only have a Swain
To Rule, and to secure the Plain,
One that is skilled in every Art,
Can use the Crook as well as Dart,
Will clear our Folds from Wolves and Thieves,
That killed our Lambs, and stole our Beeves:
But Sylvia too will have no less
Than perfect Joy and Happiness;
How pleased She looks; how Sweet and Grave,
To see so Great a Man Her Slave:
Oh! what must we expect and find
From such a Noble Pair, and so combined!

Tomalin, Behold, the Dam'sels all appear,
Each one a Garland too does bear,
To dress the Fields more fine and gay,
And make this Shepherds Holy Day.

Willie, They never more reason had than now,
Since Sylvia does to Cupid bow;
Each one may now go choose her Mate,
And so submit to Love and Fate.

Tomalin, And now we are all together met,
Beneath this shady Grove let us sit,
Adorned in harmless Shepherds Weed,
And tune each Oaten-pipe and Reed,
And with our Songs and Roundelays
To sing the Noble Damon's Praise;
Sylvia shall be our Theme, and then
To both we'll play, of both we'll sing again;
To both we'll wish a happy Fate,
And both their happy Joys Congratulate.

Hobbinol, Come bring our Instruments before us,
And let each honest Heart
And artful Hand now bear a part,
To make a joyful Chorus:
Auspitious Pan! look down, and be
Propitious to our Harmony;
Assist each Oaten-pipe and Quill,
And teach us Thy diviner Skill,
That we in Rural Sonnets may set forth
The Praise of DAMON, and Fair SYLVIAS Worth.

SONG.
Tomalin, I.
YE Powers that influence Chaste Loves,
And You that rule o'r Meads and Groves,
Look down, and see,
And let this Pair
As happy be,
As She Is most Good, most excellently Fair.

Willie, II.
Never before in Albions Plain
Appeared so brisk, so gay a Swain;
So Princely brave,
His look does awe
Each Rural Slave,
Whose every Word to every Swain's a Law.

Hob. III.
Sylvia, the Goddess of the Groves,
That reigns in all our Hearts and Loves,
To Her this day
We celebrate,
And sing and play,
To wish Her joy in Her now happy Fate.

CHORUS. May all the Joys that Heaven can give light here,
Blessed with a God-like Fathers tender Care,
Under the Wings of Mighty PAN, may You
All His, and your Great Fathers Foes subdue,
That all the World may see what You and Heaven can do.

SONG.
Tom. Your Flocks shall all increase,

Will. And you shall live in Peace;

Hob. Your Sheep shall never stray;

Will. Your Lambs

Hob. The Wolf shall never slay;

Will. Their Dams

Tom. Shall always fruitful be;

Will. Each Swain

Tom. Shall Offerings bring to Thee;

Will. The Plain,

All. And never-dying loud-mouthed Fame,
Shall still resound with Noble Damon's Name.

Tom. Sylvia shall be,
Thou Mighty Man, to Thee
A Blessing,

Hob. Possessing
More Charms
In Her Arms
Than ever blessed Swain before.

Will. Every Field
Still shall yield
Somewhat more,
To Thy Store.

All. Whole Nature shall conspire
To fulfill
Thy great Will,
And more Noble Desire.

Tom. In this great Union, We
Expect not only Happiness,
But that in future Ages it should bless,
And send down Joys to our Posterity.

Willie. Never may you want a Son,
To grace the fertile Albion Plain;
How wonderfully blessed would be each Swain,
To pay their Homage at His Rural Throne.

CHORUS by All. May every thing assist your Love;
May all the Powers that rule above
Conspire together how to bless,
And give You everlasting Happiness.

Hobbinol, 'Twas well performed; but before we sleep
Let Us careful be to fold our Sheep:
Then practice o'r our Rural Lays
We sung to day in DAMON'S Praise.

Willie, Agreed, my Hobbinol, we will,
And every day increase our Skill;
And every year, more brisk and gay,
Welcome this happy Pair, this Shepherds Holy Day.

FINIS:
