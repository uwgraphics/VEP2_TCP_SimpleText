sort; and yet of great usefulness for all to understand that are willing to be
Scholars.

Being Only a rude Essay, by a Lover of Learning, who intends (God permitting,
and the Inhabitants of England accepting) not only to make this more complete,
but also to prepare by degrees such helps for Learning so far as concerns
English, that none shall have cause more to complain for want of it: but the
Slothful, and wilfully Ignorant.

With Allowance.

How to use this Book.
LEt all the Scholars, or those that have got one of those Books to use, stand
in a row, then let the lowermost stand forth, and ask the next above him the
first question in this Book; and let the other give the answer in his own Book;
then let the same person ask the same question of the next above, and let him
answer without Book, if he can answer, let the first person ask the next
question in the Book, and let the answer be given in the Book, and then let the
third above answer without Book. If the third cannot answer, ask the next above
till some body can; and so do till three questions are asked and answered, both
within Book and without, and where the last question is answered, let the
person asking take his place just below, in the like manner, or some other, let
the next lowermost; and so all oppose each other for their places once a day,
more or less, as the teacher thinks meet.
