A DIALOGUE Between the FLAG OF St. MARTIN's Steeple, AND THE Standard AT THE
TOWER.

LONDON, Printed by D.E. and fold by A. Baldwin, near the Oxford Arms in
Warwick Lane. MDCXCVIII.

TO THE Right Honorable JOHN Lord JEFFERYES, Baron of WEM, etc.
MY LORD,
THE Noble Character you are Master of, And the kind Reception your Lordship
has been pleased to give to Things of this Nature has emboldened me to make
this Present to Your Lordship. And the Your Lordship's Hours are general
Employed in more serious Exercise yet the Perusal of so Trifling a Pamphlet,
may so soften your more severe Studies, as it may be counted a Diversion, if it
cannot have the Name of a Pleasure. My Lord, since the Corruption of the Age
has been such, as to render Things Animate ill employers of their Reason, it is
but just that the Things which are Inanimate, should serve as so many
Instructions to 'em; and to give Beasts, and Things void of Speech, the use of
their Tongue, cannot be counted as Harm, since to take it from Man, who makes
so ill use of it, would ^arry the appearance of Justice with it. The two Flags
which ^rave Your Lordship's Acceptance, ^ontend for Religion and Loyalty, and I
cannot but think I have done Justice to that of the Court, in making it prevail
in the Dispute, since the Church's has so far made a Forfeit of Both, as to
have no very good Plea to Either. But, my Lord, there needs no giving your
Lordship a light into my Design, who will but too soon (for its Author) give
Your Judgment of it. All I have to do, is, to ask Your Lordship's Acceptance,
and that You would be pleased to pardon the Deficiencies of,

My Lord, Your Lordship's Most Obedient Servant. W. P.

A DIALOGUE Between the FLAG of St. Martin's Steeple, AND THE STANDARD at the
TOWER.
SInce Beasts, Fish, and Birds
Now Discourse, and use Words,
And Steeples, and Spires fall a Preaching;
There Is a way, without doubt,
For a Standard and Clout,
To show likewise their Talent of Speech in.
St. Martin's Flag. DEar Brother Flag,
You have heard of the Drag --
Half a word is enough to the Wise;
But Lord, how Grasshopper
Looked to Monster so proper,
And of such a terrible Size!
I, faith that same Beast,
Though I once was your Jest,
And the Subject of Mirth and your Laughter,
With His Talons and Nails
Has quite turned the Scales,
And I Am now made a Man for hereafter.
The Church, Boy, the Church!
Both Steeple and Porch,
Is allowed for a Place that is good:
And Egad Sir, when Majors,
Went to Halls to say Prayers,
It was almost as much as it could.
I must needs tell you now,
Without Flattery or Bow,
I Am as good as your self for the future,
Though you bear a great Name,
Our Flags are the same,
And our Qualities also should suit here.

Standard. VAin, Silly, poor Rag,
Show his Majesty's Flag,
The Respect which is due to his Place,
Nor dare to intrude
With Discourses so rude,
And with Words so presumptuous and base.
Dog, look where I stand,
And the City command,
From the King's Royal Tower and Palace.
Whilst to humor the People,
You are placed on the Steeple,
Though you would done as much good on the G --
One would think 'twas enough
For the Parson to Huff,
And force Tithes and Respect from the Crowd;
Because he looks Great,
And takes on him some State,
Must the poor Parish-Clout too be proud?

St. Mar. Flag. A Clout Sir! for shame,
Use a decenter Name,
Since I stand on a place that is divine,
Though I cost not so many
A Pound, and fair Penny,
Yet my Clout's a Flag as well as thine.
Both Collectors, and Wardens
Have contributed Farthings,
To make me look Great as I do:
And I think I say right,
If with Main and Might,
I have done as much good full as you.
In short, though your Streamer
May powerful seem here,
'Cause with Ditches and Guns so surrounded,
I have known Sir, a time,
When my Bell-Ferrys Chime
Has those Guns, and those Ditches confounded:
When your Huffers and Dingers
Were afraid of my Ringers,
Though commanded by stout Sir Ned Hales:
And those you called Vermin,
My Porters and Carmen,
Made your Lace-coated Hero's turn Tails.

Standard. YEs, my Friend, that is certain,
Thou deserve a great part in
The Blessings this Nation has bought:
But methought it looked odly,
To see Clergy so godly,
Dissent from the Doctrines they taught.
How Pulpit and Desk,
With serious Burlesque,
Laid forth the Prerogative Royal!
And with Bell, Book, and Candle,
Cursed those who dared handle
A Text, which should offer Denial!
But when Right Divino
Grappl'd at the Church Rhino,
And the Tythe-Pigs were like to be seized;
Then St. Martin's and Bow,
Turn their Yes, Yes, to No,
And their Hearers might do as they pleased.
Prithee where is the Great doing
To help Save from Ruin
A people the Church had quite Crazed?
How so mightily just
To lay part of the Dust,
Which the Wind of your Pulpits had raised?
But now keep your distance,
I want no Assistance
From such Raga Muffins, it is certain,
Had Tower Flag had that Lion
In those times, as I on,
Let me tell you, a Fart for St. Martin.

St. Martin's Flag. YOu are much in the Wrong,
To use a foul Tongue,
To a Church where a Prelate did Teach in:
Though the Parson's speak ill,
Yet the good Bishops still,
Have an Excellent way in their preaching.
Consider, though you are
Counted Best, and the Truer,
That holy Things will be the Finest:
And it is but in vain
For a Thing that is Profane
To pretend to Cope with the Divinest.
Your Silk does indeed
My Calicoe exceed,
Yet Sir, though you stand on the Tower:
I am fixed on a Place,
Which teaches more Grace,
And should have more Honor and power.
To the King you belong,
And I do you no wrong,
If I say that my Master is greater:
And I am in a Station,
(Notwithstanding your Passion)
More great, and exceedingly better.
Though I stand like a Fool here,
My Master as Ruler,
Your Sovereign Lord does preserve;
And though he is a King,
It Is no uncivil thing,
If I say, that your King does him serve.

Standard. I Must own Sir, it is true,
Give all Folks their due,
That the place which you stand on is holy;
But for you to lay claim,
To be counted the same,
It looks both like Madness and Folly.
Because Bishop and Priest
The Steeple has blessed,
Must a Flag of those Blessings partake?
And because it is seated
On a Place Consecrated,
Be holy for that Place's sake?
By my Troth, Sir, you are out,
In looking so Stout,
And fancying you are e're a jot better,
Because you are so near
House of Goodness and Prayer,
Must it is Goodness belong to your Seat here?
No, my Friend, you are mistaken
In such merry making,
And are very much out of the Road;
I Have a much better Plea,
And the Proverb for me
Says, Near the Church, is far from God.

St. Martin's Flag. HOw? A Court Standard dare*
With a Church to compare,
And pretend to Religion, and Virtue?
'Twould be very fine Sport,
To see Goodness at Court,
Or Divinity there have a Party.
Your Flag is too fine
For Matters Divine,
Or to deal in Religious Cares;
Lord! How Man with Laced Coat,
Would be reckoned to dote,
Should that Coat of his be at Prayers!

St. Mar. Fl. THat my Men in great Places,
And my Coats daubed with Laces,
Don't pay much Respect to the Church,
Is because your Black-Coats,
So often change their Notes,
And leave those whom they guide in the Lurch.
But what is this Discourse
To a Flag of my Force?
Prithee what did thou e're that was Good,
Besides gather the Mob
To break Windows and Rob,
E're since on that Place thou have stood?
Has that Flag of thine
Been so Loyal as mine,
(For that is a Subject's Chief Glory)
Or such glad Tidings shown
To Suburbs and Town,
As my Standard which Streams now before ye?

Stand. YEs, I think, Sir, much more,
To the best of my Power,
I was always beforehand with you:
Neither Victory nor Rout,
But I was hung out,
For the Joyful Spectators to view.
I was ready and willing,
When Men Iniskilling
Had one single Rapparee seized.
Strait my Zeal to disclose,
And tell what cursed Blows,
Those Champions could give if they pleased.
With my Flag o^ my Staff
How I Would twitter and laugh,
To think that our Side was the Winner.
And that we had got
The unmerciful Sot,
And safely Secured the damned Sinner.
Whilst yours all this while,
Would not give one poor Smile;
So far was your Standard from Laughter:
Nor had, on my Soul,
Any Flag on your Pole,
Or showed any Joy for the Matter.

Stand. PRithee, what of all this,
Where Have I done amiss
Because I took on me due State?
And as 'twas my place,
Would never debase
My Standard, in Matters not great?
One poor silly Thief
To his Ruin and Grief,
May be Triumph enough for your Clout;
But Thousands must die
Before such as I,
Will vouchsafe to Rejoice or hang out.
Wherefore, make no Denial,
But that I am most Loyal,
Since I never yet have given that Offense,
And never did show
Such Rejoicing as you,
At the Birth, Sir, of you know what Prince.

St. Mar. Fl. A Good Reason why Sir,
Because at that Time, I Sir,
Was in Being, which then you were not:
Had you then had your Birth,
You Would have showed as much Mirth,
As the rest of us Flags, for a Pot.
The Flag whom you succeed,
Did as all of us did,
And kept as great pother, and Fluttered:
But had not the Church,
Been afraid of Court Birch,
St. Martins had plaguily Muttered.
For to put such damned Slights
In our Freedoms and Rights,
As a spurious Welsh Heir, was a hard Case.
'Slife, Sir, if I durst,
I had never been the first;
But I mightily love a whole Carcass.
However I Have since,
Atton'd for that Prince,
And have been more Zealous and Hearty;
For another guessed Cause,
Our Lives, and our Laws,
And another guessed Monarch and Party.

Stand. PRithee, what have you done,
For such Crimes to Atone,
Or recover your Primitive Fame?
If your Flag did not dare,
Your Sermons and Prayer,
Might never have made use of his Name.

St. Mar. Fl. DOne? By all that is holy,
I admire at your Folly;
Sure, your Reason, and Eyes too, are blind:
As if my Deserts,
And Love for True Hearts,
Were Virtues too bright for thy Mind.
Why, Man, did not I
Let my Colors fly,
As soon as the News came to Town,
That Russel had beat,
And sunk the French Fleet,
And with Powder and Ball, knocked 'em down?
I am likewise as sure,
That no sooner Namur,
Had Surrendered to His Majesty's Troops,
But, Egad, Sir, I strove,
To show my Zeal and my Love,
And caused many Halloo's and Whoops.
In the mean while, you chose
To defer your fine Shows,
Till the News was Confirmed by Express.
And then, Sir, you drew
Your Flag out, it is true,
And in Troth, Friend, how could you do less?

Stand. FAith, Sir, I Am too Just,
To take News so on Trust,
As your unadvised Rag has been wont;
Great Folks in my Station,
Ought to use Meditation,
And first to consider upon it.
But to Joy for a Peace
Before Wars did cease,
And let lose your poor Flag for a Truce;
What else was it thought,
But a Business of Naught,
It looked so much like an Abuse?

St. Mar. Fl. THat was nothing but Zeal
For the good Commonweal;
And though the Peace was not then Signed,
Yet I knew that it must,
And what the Clergy mistrust,
Must always fall out as Divined.
My good Dr. L --
Vowed he would lay a Tester;
And to each Overseer declared,
That Peace was as sure,
As he had Soul's Cure,
And he bad me deny't if I dared.
Now, how could I refuse
To Report so good News,
Confirmed by my Teacher and Pastor?
Or a Servant as I,
Dare make a Reply,
To so Knowing and Learned a Master?

Stand. BUt you saw, Friend, at last
Your Belief went too fast,
And your positive Parson had Erred:
Pray, where had been the Harm,
If you would never took Alarm,
And your Joys for some time had deferred?
Our Flags then had joined
To combat the Wind,
And made a most faithful Report
Of the Joys and Increase,
Which should flow from the Peace,
And the Church been as true as the Court.
But I find it is in vain
To attempt to restrain
The Pride of your Soul at this time;
Or to think the Church Flag
So addicted to Brag,
Should impute to the Church any Crime.
Wherefore, Sir, Adieu,
Neither Honest nor True,
But always by Interest guided;
Whom Preferment alone,
Makes adhere to the Throne,
And from all but the Great ones divided.
Since Pride will not let you know
The Respect which you owe,
I reser't to another Dispute,
Though, if you would laid Claim
To Sense, or to Shame,
By my Soul, Sir, you would long since been mute.

FINIS.
