Christian Reader,
BEing desired to peruse and give our opinion of ^e resol^tions in thi^ Letter
now presented to ^y view: We must confess, they appeared t^ ^ery precious;
For we have seldom seen acuteness, profoundnesse, and godliness, so
eminently, equ^lly, and happilly matched. There are in Christ, School diverse
forms, elementaries, and men of exercise^ wits The Scholar proposing these
cases was no Puny, and he was happy in meeting with a teacher so able for
resolution. Therefore, who ever reads and ^eeds, will not re^ent of his labor.
But the mo^e kn^wing the Reader is, and the more experienced in the Ways of
Christ, the more delight may ^e take in, and the more p^fit may he reap by
these pious and profound resolutions. So we are

^0.

Q. What is God?
A. God only knows himself, no man can so know him and live: Yet he has
manifested himself unto us in his backparts, according to our manner or measure
of knowing things: and we need know no more than these, that we may live. 1 Timothy 6. ^6. Exodus 33. 19. 23.

Q. What are Gods back-parts?
A. They are two, First, His sufficiency. Psalm. 36. 9. Secondly, His
Efficiency. Romans 4. 21

Q. What is Gods sufficiency?
A. It is his perfect fullness of all good, whereby he is allsufficient for us
in himself. Psalm 16. 1^. Gen 17. 1.

Q. Wherein stands and appears Gods sufficiency?
A. First, In his Essence. Psalm. 68. 19.

Secondly, In his subsistence or persons. 2 Samuel 7. 20, 25.

Q. What is Gods Essence?
A. Whereby he is that absolute first being. Rev. 1. 8. Isa. 44. 6. Exodus 3. 14.

Q. Can you sufficiently conceive of the Glory of this one most pure Essence,
by one act of Faith?
A. No, and therefore the Lord has manifested it unto us by diverse attributes,
Deuteronomy. 29. 29. Exodus 34. 6, 7.

Q. What are Gods attributes?
A. That one most pure Essence diversely apprehended of us, as it is diversely
made known unto us. 1 John 4. 16. Isa. 43. 25.

Q. How many kinds of attributes are there?
A. There are two sorts of them.

First, Some showing what God is.

Secondly, Some showing who God is.

Q. By what attr^butes know you what God is?
A. By these. God is a Spirit living of himself. Joh. 4. 24. Joh. 5. 26.

Q. By what attributes do you understand who God is?
A. By his Essential properties, which show to us: First, How great a God he
is. Psalm. 77. 13.

Secondly, What a manner of God he is. Mat. 6. 17.

Q. What attributes show how great a God he is?
A. First, His infiniteness, whereby he is without all limits of Essence. 2.
Chr. 2. 5, 6.

Secondly, His Eternity, whereby he is without all limits of beginning,
succession, or end of Time. Psalm. 102. 25, 26, 27. 1 Timothy 1. 17.

Q. What are those attributes which show what a manner of God he is?
A. His qualities whereby he acts with, are of two sorts.

First, His Faculties, whereby he is able to act. Esa. 60. 16. and 63. 1.

Secondly, His Virtues of those Faculties, whereby he is prompt and ready to
act. Psalm. 86. 5.

Q. What are his faculties?
A. First, His Understanding, whereby he understands together, and at once
all truth. Heb 4. 13. Act. 15* ^8.

Secondly, His Will, whereby he purely wills all good. Psalm. 119. 68.

Q. What are the virtues of those Faculties?
A. First, They a^e Intellectual, the virtues of his understanding, as Wisdom,
knowledge, and the rest.

Secondly, (...), the virtue of his Will, as Love, Holiness, Mercy. In the
acting o^ both which, consists Gods happiness.

Thus much have you seen of Gods sufficiency, in regard of his Essence. Now
follows his subsistence.

Q. What are his subsistences or persons?
A. That one most pure Essence with its Relative properties.

Q. What are those Relative properties?
A. They are three.

First, To beget.

Secondly, To be begotten.

Thirdly, To proceed from both.

Q. How many persons learn you from hence to be in God?
A. Three.

First, the first, is the Father, the first Person in order, begetting the Son.
Psalm. 2. 7.

Secondly, The Son, the second Person, begotten of the Father Joh. 3. 6. Heb.
1. 3.

Thirdly, The Spirit, the third Person, proceeding from them both. Joh. 15. 26.

Q. Are these three Persons three distinct Gods?
A. No, For they are that one pure Essence, and therefore but one God. Ioh. 1.
1. Romans 9. 5. 1 Cor. 6. 16. 1 Cor. 2. 10.

Q. If every Person be God, how can they be distinct. Persons, and not distinct
Gods?
A. Yes, Because one and the same thing may have many Relative properties, and
respects of being, which in the Godhead makes distinct Persons. As one and the
same man, may be a Father in one respect, a Master in another respect, and a
Scholar in aenother respect.

Q. If these three Persons be but one God, what follows from hence?
A. That all the three Persons are Coequal, Coeternall, subsisting in, not
separating from each other, and therefore delighting in each ^ther, glorifying
each other. Prove. 8. 30.

Thus much concerning God.
Now concerning the works of God.
Q. Thus much concerning Gods sufficiency, What i^ his efficiency?
A. Whereby he works all things, and all in all things. Romans 11. 36. Esa. 45.
7.

Q. What of God shines forth, and are you to behold in his Efficiency?
A. Two things.

First, Gods Omnipotency, in respect of his Essence.

Secondly, the cooperation and distinct manner of working of the three
Persons. Romans 1. 20. John 5. 17.

Q. What is Gods Omnipotency?
A. It is his Almighty power, whereby he is able to bring to pass all that he
does will, or what ever he can will or decree. 2 Chronicles. 20. 6. Phil. 3. 21.
Mat. 3. 9. Psalm. ^15. 7.

Q. What is Gods Decree?
A. It is his Eternal and determinate purpose, concerning the effecting of all
things by his mighty power, according to his counsel. Ephesians. 1. 11.

Q. What attributes or glory of God appear in his Decree?
A. First, His Constancy, whereby his Decree remains unchangeable. Number. ^3. 19.

Secondly, His Truth, whereby he delivers nothing but what he has decreed.
Jer. 10. 10.

Thirdly, His Faithfulness, whereby he effects what ever he decrees
according thereunto. Esa. 46. 10.

Q. What is Gods Counsel?
A His deliberation as it were, for the best effecting of every thing according
to his Wisdom. Act. 4. 24. Psalm. 40. 24.

Q What is Gods Wisdom?
A. It is the Idaea or perfect platform of all things in the mind of God, which
either can be known, or shall be done, according to the good pleasure of his
will. Heb. ^1. 3. Prove. 8. 12, 13.

Q. What is the good pleasure of Gods will?
A. It is the most free Act of his Will, whereby he wills himself directly,
as the greatest good, and all other things for himself, according to his good
pleasure. Mat. 11. 25. Prove. 16. 4.

Q. What learn you from hence?
A. That Gods good pleasure is the first and best cause of all things. Psalm.
115. 3. Psalm. 33. 8, 9, 10, 11.

Q What is the Co-operations of the three Persons in Gods Efficiency?
A. Whereby they work the same thing together unseparably. Joh. 5. 17, 19. and
16. 13, 14.

Q. If they work the same thing together, How is it that some works are
attributed to God the Father, as Creation; some to the Son, as Redemption; some
to the holy Spirit, as application?
A. This is not because the same work is not common to all the three Persons,
but because that work is principally attributed in Scripture to that person
whose distinct manner of working appears chiefly in the work.

Q. What is God the Fathers distinct manner of working?
A. His working is from himself by the Son, and to the holy Ghost, Psalm. 33. 6.
Joh. 1. 3, and hence the beginning, and so the Creation of all things is
attributed to him.

Q. What is God the Sons manner of working?
A. His working is from the Father, by the Holy Ghost, Ioh. 14. 16. and hence
the dispensation of all things, and so Redemption, is attributed unto him.

Q. What is the holy Gosts manner of working?
A. His working is from the Father and the Son, Joh. 14. ^6. and hence the
consummation of all things, and so application, is attributed unto him.

Q. Wherein does Gods efficiency or working appear?
A. In two things.

First, In his creation of the world.

Secondly, In his providence over the world. Esa. 37. 16.

Q. What is his creation?
A. It is Gods efficiency, whereby he made the whole world of nothing,
originally exceeding good. Psalm. 33. 9. Genesis 1. 31.

Q. Did the Lord make the world in an instant?
A. No, but by parts, in the space of six days, described at large by Moses.
Genesis 1.

Q. When did the Lord make the third heaven, with the Angels their inhabitants?
A. In the first day, in the first beginning of it. Genesis 1. 1. Job 38. 6, 7.

Q. What is the creation of the third heaven?
A. Whereby he made it to be the heaven of heaveas, a most glorious place,
replenished with all pleasure which belongs to eternal happiness, wherein his
Majesty is seen face to face, and therefore called the habitation of God. 2
Chr. 2. 5, 6. Psalm. ^6. 11. Psalm. 63. 15.

Q. What is the creation of the Angels?
A. Whereby he created an innumerable number of them, in holiness, to be
ministering spirits, with most accutenesse of understanding, liberty of will,
great strength, and speedy in motion, to celebrate his praises, and execute his
commands, specially to the heirs of salvation. Heb. 11. 22. Joh. 8. 44. Heb. 1.
14. 2 Samuel 14. 20. Jude 6. 2 Pet. 2. 11. Esa. 6. 2. Psalm. 130. 20.

Q. When did God create man?
A. The sixth day. Genesis 1. 27.

Q. How did God create man?
A. He made him a reasonable creature, consisting of body, and an immortal
Soul, in the Image of God. Genesis 2. 7. Genesis 1. 28.

Q. What is the Image of God wherein he was made?
A. That hability of man to resemble God, and wherein he was like unto God, in
wisdom, holiness, righteousness, both in his nature, and in his government of
himself and all creatures. Col. 3. 10. Ephesians. 4. 24. Genesis 1. 26.

Q. What became of man being thus made?
A. He was placed in the Garden of Eden, as in his Princely Court, to live unto
God, together with the wom^n which God gave him. Genesis 2. 15.

Thus much of Gods Creation.
Q. What is his Providence?
A. Whereby he provideth for his creatures being made, even to the least
circumstance. Psalm. 145. 16. Proverbs 16. 33.

Q. How is Gods Providence distinguished?
A. It is either, first, Ordinary, and mediate, whereby he provideth for his
creatures by ordinary and usual means, Hos. 2. 22.

Secondly, Extraordinary and immediate, whereby he provides for his creatures
by miracles, or immediately by himself, Psalm. ^6. 4 Dan. 3. 17.

Q. Wherein is his Providence seen?
A. First, in Conversation, whereby he upholdeth things in their being and
power of working, Act. 17. 28. Psalm. 104. 29, 30. Nehem. 9. 6.

Secondly, in Gubernation, whereby he guides, directs and brings all creatures
to their ends, Psalm. 29 10. Psalm. 33. 11.

Q. Does God govern all creatures alike?
A. No, but some he governs by a common providence, and others by a special
providence, to wit, Angels and Men, to an eternal estate of happiness in
pleasing him, or of misery in displeasing ^im, Deuteronomy. 30. 15, 16.

Q. What of Gods Providence appears in his special government of man?
A. Two things.

1. Man's Apostasy or fall. 2. His Recovery or rising again.
Q. Concerning man's fall, what are you to observe therein?
A. Two things.

1. His transgression in eating the forbidden fruit, Genesis 2. 17. 2. The
propagation of this unto all Adams posterity.
Q. Was this so great a sin to eat of the forbidden fruit?
A. Yes, exceeding great, this Tree being a Sacrament of the Covenant; also he
had a special charge not to eat of it: and in it the whole man did strike
against the whole Law, even when God had so highly advanced him.

Q. What are the causes of this transgression?
A. The blameless cause was the Law of God. Romans 5. 13. And hence as the Law
did it, so God did it, holily, justly, and blamelesly. Romans 7. 10, 1^, 12.

Q. What are the blameable causes?
A. Two principally

1. The devil abusing the Serpent to deceive the women, Genesis 3. 1. 2. Man
himself, in abusing his own free will, in receiving the temptations which he
might have resisted, Ephesians. 7. 29.
Q. What is the Devil?
A. That great number of apostate and rebellious Angels, which through pride
and blasphemy against God, and malice against man, became liars and murderers
of man, by bringing him into that sin, Luke 11. 18. 1 Timothy 3. 6. 1 John 3. 12.
John 8. 44.

Q. What are the effects and fruits of this transgression?
A. They are two.

1. Guilt, whereby they are tied to undergo due punishment for the fault, Romans
3 19. 2. Punishment, which is the just anger of God upon them for the filth of
sin, Romans 1. 18.
Q. What are the particular punishments insllcted on the causes of this sin?
A. Besides the fearful punishment of the devils, mentioned Jude 6. and that of
the Serpent and the Woman, Genesis 3. 14, 16. the punishment of man was first, Sin
Original and Actual; Secondly, death. Genesis 5. 5.

Q. What is sin?
A. The transgression of Gods Law, John 3. 4.

Q. What is Original and Actual sin?
A. First, Original sin is the contrariety of the whole nature of man to the
Law of God, whereby it being averse from all good, is inclined to all evil,
Eccles. 8. 11. Genesis 6. 5. Romans 6. 20.

Secondly, Actual sin is the continual jarring of the actions of man from the
Law of God, by reason of Original sin, and so man has no free will to any
spiritual good, Esa. 65. 2, 3. James 1. 14, 15. Esa. 1. 11.

Q. What death is that God inflicts on man for sin?
A. A double death.

1. The first death of the body, together with the beginnings of it in this
world, as grief, shame, losses, sicknesses, Deuteronomy. 28. 21, 22, 25. 2. The second
death of the soul, which is the eternal separation and ejection of the soul
after death, and soul and body after judgment, from God, into everlasting
torments in hell.
Q Is there no beginning of this death, as there is of the other in this life?
A. Yes, at first, security and hardness of heart, which cannot feel sin its
greatest evil.

2. Terrors of conscience, Heb. 2: 15.

3. Bondage of Satan, Ephesians. 2. 2.

4. The curse of God in all blessings, whereby they are fitted for destruction,
Romans 9. 22.

Q. What of Gods Attributes shine forth here?
1. His holiness, whereby he being pure from all sin, cannot away with the
least sin in the best of his creatures, Heb. 1. 13.

2. His Justice, whereby he being most just in himself, cannot but punish man
for sin, as well as reward him for well doing, 2 These. 1. 6.

3. His Patience, whereby he uses pity, patience, and bounty, to his
creatures offending, Romans 2. 3.

Q. Is this sin, and the punishment of it derived to all men's postetity?
A. Yes, John 3. 3. Ephesians. 2. 3.

Q. How is it propagated?
A. By the imputaiion of Adams sin unto us, and so the punishment must needs
follow upon it, Romans 5. 13.

Q. Why should Adams sin be imputed to all his posterity?
A. Because we were in him as the members in the head, as children in his
loins, as debtors in their surety, as branches in their roots, it being just,
that as if he standing, all had stood, by imputation of his righteousness, so
he falling, all should fall, by the imputation of his sin.

Q. Thus have you seen man's apostasy from God, What is his recovery?
A. It is the return of man to the favor of God again, merely out of favor,
and the exceeding riches of his free grace, Ephesians. 2. 12, 13. Romans 5. 8.

Q. How are we brought into favor, and what are the parts of this recovery?
A. Two ways.

First, by Redemption, 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20,

Secondly, by Application hereof, Tit. 3. 6.

Q. What is Redemption?
A. The satisfaction made, or the price paid, to the justice of God for the
life and deliverance of man out of the captivity of sin, Satan, and death, by a
Redeemer, according to the Covenant made between him and the Father, 1 Cor. 6.
20. Luke 1. 74. Esa. 55. 10, 11.

Q. Who is this Redeemer?
A. Jesus Christ, God and Man, Matthew. 1. 23. John 1. 14. Col. 2. 19.

Q. Why is he God-Man?
A. That so he might be a fit Mediator, to transact all businesses between God
and man, in the execution of his three Offices whereunto he was anointed of the
Father, 1 Timothy 2. 5. Esa. 42. 12.

Q. What are those three Offices of Christ?
1. His Prophetical Office, whereby he does reveal the will of the Father,
Act. 3. 22. Col. 2. 3.

2. His Priestly Office, whereby he makes full atonement with the Father for
us, Col. 1. 20.

3. His Kingly Office, whereby he governs his people whom he had taught and
reconciled, subduing their enemies, and procuring their eternal peace, Psalm. 2.
6. Esa. 9. 6.

Q. How has Christ Jesus made satisfaction?
A. By his humiliation, whereby he was made subject throughout his whole life
and death, to the strict Justice of God, to perform what ever the same might
require for the redemption of man, Gal. 4. 4, 5.

Q. What did Gods Justice require of man?
A. 1. Death, for the breach of the Law, and that Christ tasted, in his bitter
sufferings, both of body and Soul, by being made sin, and so abolishing sin;
and this is called his Passive Obedience, Heb. 2. 9. Ephesians. 1. 7. 2 Cor. 5. 21.
Gal. 3. 13.

2. Perfect Obedience, in fulfilling the Law perfectly, both in his Nature and
Actions, for the procuring and meriting of life; and this is called his Active
Obedience, Heb. 7. 26.

Q. What follows Christ's Humiliation?
A. His Exaltation, which is his glorious victory, and open Triumph over all
his and our enemies, sin, Satan, and death, in the several degrees of it, Luke
24. 26. Phil. 2. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 15. 5, 7.

Q. What is the first degree of Christ's Exaltation?
A. His Resurrection the third day, whereby his Soul and body by the power of
the Godhead, were brought together again, and so rose again from death,
appearing to his Disciples for the space of forty days, 1 Cor. 15. 4. Joh. 2.
19. Act. 1. 3.

Q. What is the second degree of Christ's Exaltation?
A. His Ascension into Heaven, which was the going up of the Manhood into the
third Heaven, by the power of the Godhead, from Mount Olivet, in the sight of
his Disciples, Acts 1. 11, 12.

Q. What is the third degree of his exaltation?
A. His sitting at the right hand of God, whereby he being advanced to the
fullness of all glory, in both natures, governs and rules all things
together with the Father, as Lord over all, for the good of his people, Mark
16. 9. Psalm. 110. 1. 1 Cor. 15. 25. Ephesians. 1. 20, 21, 22. 1 Pet. 3. 22.

Q. What is the fourth and last degree of his exaltation?
A. His return to judgment, which is his seconid coming into this world with
great glory and Majesty to judge the quick and the dead, to the confusion of
all them that would not have him rule over them, and to the unspeakable good of
his people, Mat. 19. 28. 2 Timothy 4. 1. Act. 17. 31. 2 These. 1. 7, 8, 9.

Q. Thus much of Redemption, the first part of his Recovery. What is
application?
A. Whereby the Spirit by the Word and Ministry thereof, makes all that which
Christ as Mediator has done for the Church, efficacious to the Church as her
own, John 16. 14. Titus 3. 5, 6, 7. John 10. 16. Romans 10. 14, 17. Ephesians. 5. 25,
26.

Q. What is the Church?
A. The number of Gods Elect, Heb. 12. 23. John 17. 9, 10, 11. John 10. 16.
Ephesians. 1. 22, 23.

Q. How does the Spirit make application to the Church?
A. 1. By union of the Soul to Christ, Phil. 3. 9, 10.

By Communion of the benefits of Christ to the Soul.

Q. What is this Union?
A. Whereby the Lord joining the Soul to Christ, makes it one spirit with
Christ, and so gives it possession of Christ, and right unto all the benefits
and blessings of Christ, 1 Cor. 6. 17. John 17. 21. Romans 8. 32. 1 John 5. 12.

Q. How does the Spirit make this Union?
A. Two ways.

1. By cutting off the Soul from the old Adam, or the wild Olive Tree; in the
work of preparation, Romans 11. 23, 24. 2. By putting or ingrasting the Soul into
the second Adam, Christ Jesus, by the work of vocation, Acts 26. 18.
Q. What are the Parts of the Preparation of the Soul so Christ?
A. They are two.

1. Contrition, whereby the Spirit immediately cuts off the Soul from its
security in sin, by making it to mourn for it, and separating the Soul from it,
as the greatest evil, Isa. 61. 1, 3. Jer. 4. 3. 4. Mat. 11. 20, 28. 2.
Humiliation, whereby the Spirit cuts the Soul off from self-confidence in any
good it has or does. Especially, by making it to feel its want, and
unworthiness of Christ, and ^nce submits to be disposed of as God pleases,
Phil. 3. 7, 8. ^ke 16. 9. Luke 15. 17, 18, 19.
Q. Wh^t a^e the parts of Vocation of the Soul to Christ?
A. 1. The Lords call and invitation of the Soul to come to Christ, in the
Revelation, and offer of Christ and his rich Grace, 2 Cor. 5. 10.

2. The receiving of Christ, or the coming of the whole Soul out of it self
unto Christ, for Christ by virtue of that resistable power of the Spirit in the
call, and this is Faith, Jer. 3. 32. John 6. 44, 45. John 10. 16. Esa. 55. 5.

Q. Thus much of our Union. What is the communion of Christ's benefits unto the
Soul?
A. Whereby the Soul possessed with Christ, and right'unto him, has by the
same Spirit fruition of him, and all his benefits, John 4. 10. 14.

Q. What is the first of those benefits we do enjoy from Christ?
A. Justification, which is the Gracious Sentence of God the Father, whereby
for the satisfaction of Christ apprehended by Faith, and imputed to the
faithful, he absolves them from the guilt and condemnation of all sins, and
accepts them as perfectly righteous to eternal life, Romans 3. 24, 25. Romans 4.
6, 7, 8. Romans 8. 33, 34.

Q. What difference is there between Justification, and Sanctification?
A. Justification is by Christ's Righteousness inherent in Christ only*
Sanctification is by a righteousness from Christ inherent in our selves, 2 Cor.
5. 21. Phil. 3. 9.

2. Justification is perfected at once, and admits of no degrees, because it is
by Christ his perfect righteousness: sanctification is imperfect, being begun in
this life, Rev. 12. 1. Phi. 3. 11.

Q. What is the second benefit next in order to Justification, which the
faithful receive from Christ?
A. Reconciliation, whereby a Christian justified is actually reconciled, and
at peace with God, Romans 5. 1. John 2. 12. and hence follows his peace with all
creatures.

Q. What is the third benefit next unto Reconciliation?
A. Adoption, whereby the Lord accounts the faithful his Sons, c^owns them
with privileges of Sons, and gives them the Spirit of Adoption, the same spirit
which is in his only begotten Son, 1 John 3. 2. Romans 8. 11. 14, 15, 16, 17.

Q. What is the fourth benefit next to Adoption?
A. Sancification, whereby the Sons of God are renewed in the whole man, unto
the Image of their heavenly Father in Christ Jesus, by Mortification, or their
daily dying to sin by virtue of Christ's death: and by Vivification their daily
rising to newness of life, by Christ's resurrection, 1 These. 5. 23. Ephesians. 4. 24.
Jer. 31. 32. Romans 6. 7, 8.

Q. What follows from this Mortification and Vivification?
A. A continual war and combat between the renewed part assisted by Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, and the unrenewed part assisted by Satan and this evil
world, Romans 7. 21, 22, 23.

Q. What is the fifth and last benefit next unto Sanctification?
A. Glorification, which has two degrees. The one in this life, and the other
in the world to come.

Q. What is the first degree of Glorification in this life?
A. Lively expectation of Glory, from the assurance and shedding abroad Gods
love in our hearts, working joy unspeakable, Rom 5. 2, 5. Titus 2. 13.

Q. What is the second degree in the world to come?
A. Full frution of Glory, whereby being made complete and perfect in
Holiness, and Happiness, we enjoy all that good eye has not seen, nor ear
has heard, in our Immediate and Eternal Communion with God in Christ, Heb.
12. 23. 1 Cor. 15. 23.

Thus much of the first part, of living to God by Faith in God.
Q. What is the second part, viz. our Observance?
A. It is the duty that is to be performed to God of us, through the power of
his Holy Spirit, working in us by Faith according to the Will of God, Ephesians. 6.
6, 7. Psalm. 139. 24. Romans 6. 1. Luke 1. 74.

Q. Wherein consists our observance of God?
A. It is either Moral, or Ceremonial.

Q. Wherein consists our Moral observance of God?
A. In two things.

1. In suffering his will, whereby a Believer for the sake of Christ, chooses
rather to suffer any misery, than to commit the least sin, Heb. 11. 26. Acts
21. 13. 2. In doing his will, whereby a Believer in sense of Christ's love,
performs universal obedience to the Law of God, Romans 7. 22. 1 John. 5. 3.
Luke 1. 6. Phil. 3. 12.
Q. Is there any use of the Law to a Christian?
A. Although it be abolished to a Christian in Christ, as a Covenant of life;
(for so Adam and his posterity are still under it) yet it remains as a rule of
life, when he is in Christ, and to prepare the heart for Christ, Romans 6. 14,
15. Man. ^. 17, 18, 19, 20. Ezech. 10. 11. Romans 9.

Q. Why is not a Christian so under the Law as a Covenant of life, so as if he
breaks it by the least sin he shall die for it?
A. Because Jesus Christ has kept it perfectly for him, Romans 8. 3, 4. Romans 5.
20, 21.

Q. Can any man keep the Law perfectly in this life?
A. No, for the unregenerate wanting the Spirit of Life, cannot perfect an act
of life in obedience to it. The regenerate having the Spirit but in part,
perform it only imperfectly, Romans 8. 7. Rom 7. 21.

Q. What befal^ the unregenerate upon their disobedience unto it?
A. The eternal curse of God for the least sin, and the increase of Gods fierce
and fearful secret wrath as they increase, in sin, Gal. 3. 10. Romans 2 5.

Q. What befalls the regenerate after their breach of the Law, and imperfect
obedience unto it?
A. The Lord may threaten and correct them, but his loving kindness (in
covering their sins in their best duties by Christ, and accepting their meanest
services so far as they are quickened by his Spirit) is never taken from them,
Psalm 89. 31, 32, 33. Zach. 3 1. to 8. Isa. 56. 7. Romans 7. 20.

Q. What is that imperfect obedience of Believers which is accepted?
A. When they observe the will of Christ, as that therein

1. They confess and lament their sins, 1 John 1. 9. Romans 7. 24.

2. They desire mercy in the blood of Christ, and more of his Spirit, Phil. 39,
10, 11.

3. They return him the praise of the least ability to do his will, Psalm. 50.
23. 1 Cor. 15. 10.

Q. How is the Law, or ten Commandments divided?
A. Into two Tables. The first, showing our duty to God immediately, in the
four first Commandments. The second, our duty to man, in the six last
Commandments.

Q. What rules are you to observe to understand the Moral Law?
A. These.

1. That in whatsoever Commandment any duty is enjoined, there the contrary sin
is forbidden: and where any sin is forbidden, there the contrary duty is
commanded.

2. That the Law is spiritual, and hence requires not only outward, but inward
and spiritual obedience.

3. Where any gross sin is forbidden, there all the signs, degrees, means, and
provocations to that sin are forbidden also, and are in Gods account that sin.
And so where any duty is commanded, there all the signs, means, and
provocations to that duty are commanded also.

4. That the Law is perfect, and therefore, there is no sin in all the
Scripture, but is forbidden in it; nor no duty required (if moral) but it is
commanded in it.

Thus much of our moral observance of God.
Q. What is our ceremonial observance?
A. The celebration of the two Sacraments, Baptism and the Lords Supper.

Q What is a Sacrament?
A. It is an holy ceremony wherein external sensible things by the appointment
of Christ are separate from common use, to signify, exhibit and seal to us
that assurance of eternal life by Christ Jesus, according to the covenant of
his grace, Genesis 17. 9, 10.

Q. Which are the Sacraments?
A. They are two, Baptism and the Lord Supper.

Q. What is the external sensible part of Baptism?
A. Water, John 3. 23.

Q. What is the inward and spiritual part of Baptism, signified, exhibited,
and sealed thereby?
A. Christ's Righteousness and his Spirit,

1. Washing away our sin, and so delivering us spom death.

2. Presenting us clear before the Father, and so restoring us again to life,
Romans 4. 1 Cor. 2. 11. Mat. 3. 11.

Q. What follows from hence?
A. 1. That it is a Sacrament of our new birth and ingrafting into Christ, John
3. 5.

2. That as we are perfectly justified at once, and being newborn once, shall
never dye again. Hence this Seal is to be Administered but once.

Q. What is the external and sensible part of the Lords Supper?
A. Bread and Wine, with the Sacramental actions about the same.

Q What is the inward and spiritual part of it, signified, sealed, and
exhibited thereby?
A. The body and blood of Christ crucified, offered and given to nourish and
strengthen believers, renewing their faith unto eternal life, 1 Cor. 11. 24.
John 6. 54, 55.

Q. What follows from hence?
A. 1. That it is the Sacrament of our growth in Christ, being newborn,
because it is food given to nourish us, having received life.

2. That therefore it is to be administered and received often that we may grow.

3. That children and fools, and wicked, ought not to partake of the Sacrament,
because they cannot examine themselves, and so renew their Faith, 1 Cor. 11. 28.

Q. Ought not the Sacrament to be administered to carnal people, if they have
been baptized?
A. No, because such as are not within the Covenant, have no right to the seal
of the Covenant.

Q. Where are Believers, who have right unto this Sacrament, to seek fruition
from it?
A. Because it ought not to be administered privately, (as the Papists would)
hence Gods people are to seek to enjoy their right to it in some particular
visible Church, in joining with them, as fellow members of the same body, 1
Cor. 11. 20, 22. 1 Chronicles. 10. 17. Acts 2. 42.

Q What Members ought every particular visible Church to consist of?
A. Christ being head of every particular Church, and it his body, hence none
are to be members of the Church, but such as are members of Christ by faith, 1
Cor. 1. 2. 1 These. 1.

Q. But do not Hypocrites, and no true Members of Christ creep in?
A. Yes, but if they could have been known to be such, they ought to be kept
out, and when they are known, they are orderly to be cast out, Mat. 25. 1. 2 Timothy 3. 5. Rev. 2. 20. Tit. 3. 20.

Q. Are these Members bound only to cleave to Christ their head by Faith?
A. Yes, and to one another also by brotherly love, which they are bound to
strengthen and confirm (as well as their faith) by a solemn Covenant, Ephesians. 4.
15, 16. Col. 1. 4. Jer. 50. 4. Isa. 56. 45. Zach. 11. 14. Zeph. 3. 9. Psalm.
119. 106.

Q. What benefits are there by joining thus to a particular Church?
A: 1. Hereby they come to be under the special Governmen^ of Christ in his
Church, and the Officers thereof. Isa. 30. 20.

2. Hereby they have the promise of special bless^ng, and on their children
also. Psalm. 133. 3. Exodus 20. 6.

3. Herein they have the promise of Gods special presence.

1. Reveuling unto them his Will, Psalm. 27. 4. Psalm. 63. 2, 3.

2. Protecting them, Isa. 44. 6.

3. Hea^ing all their Prayers, Deuteronomy. 4. 7. Mat. 18. 19.

Q. Are there not some who never find these benefits?
A. Yes, Because many knowing not how to make use of Gods Ordinances, not
feeling a need of Gods presence only in them, their sin also b^inding, and
partly hardening their hearts, and polluting Gods h^se, they then become worse
when they have best means, Mat. 11. 23. ser. 17. 5, 6. Heb. 6. 8. 1 Samuel 5. 8,
9. Eze. 14. 4. 1 King. 8. 21.

Q. What are the miseries of those who carelessly, and wilfully despise, and so
refuse to join to Gods Church?
A. Besides the loss of Gods presence in the fellowship of his people, it is a
fearful sign (continuing so) God never intends to save their soals, Acts 2. 47.
Isa. 60. 12. Rev. 2. 23, 24.

Q. What therefore ought people chiefly to labor for, and to hold forth unto
the Church, that so they may be joined to it?
A. A threefold work.

1. Of Humiliation, under their misery, death, and sin, as their greatest evil,
Act. 2. 37. Mat. 3. 6. 2. Of Vocation, or their drawing to Christ, out of this
misery, as to their greatest, and only good, Acts ^. 38, 41. 3. Of new
Obedience, how they have walked in Christ since called, Act. 9. 26, 27. Mat. 3.
8.
FINIS.
