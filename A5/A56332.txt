A Declaration of the Grievances of the Kingdom, delivered in Parliament, by
John Pym ESQUIER.

dispatch, nor more difficulties to encounter; therefore we have reason to take
all advantages of order and address, and hereby we shall not only do our
own work, but dispose and enable our selves for the better satisfaction of
His Majesty's desire of supply. The grievances being removed, our affections
will carry us with speed and cheerfulness, to give His Majesty that which
may be sufficient both for his honor and support. Those that in first place
shall endeavor to redress the grievances, will be found not to hinder, but to
be the furtherers of his Majesty's service: he that takes away weights, does
as much advantage motion, as he that adds wings.

Diverse pieces of this maine work have bin already propounded, Great works are
first to be considered in the model.
his endeavor should be to present to the House a model of the whole. In the
Creation God made the world according to that Idea or form, which was eternally
preexistent in the divine mind. Moses was commanded to frame the Tabernacle
after the pattern showed him in the Mount. Those actions are seldom well
perfected in the execution, which are not first well molded in the design and
proposition.

He said, he would labor to contract those manifold affairs both of the
Church and State, which did so earnestly require the wisdom A double method
compounded of grievances and cures.
and faithfulness of this House, into a double method of grievances and cures:
and because there wanted not some who pretended, that these things wherewith
the Commonwealth is now grieved, are much for the advantage of the King, and
that the redress of them will be to His Majesty's great disadvantage and loss

doubted not but to make it appear, that in discovering the present great
distempers and disorders, and procuring remedy for them, we should be no less
serviceable to his Majesty, who has summoned us to this great Council, than
useful to those whom we do here represent: for the better effecting whereof,

he was to speak, so far as his duty and faithfulness would allow. It is a
great Prerogative to the K. and a great honor attributed to him in a Maxim of
our Law, that he can do no wrong, he is the fountain of Justice, and if there
be any injustice in the execution of his Commands, the Law casts it upon the
Ministers, and frees the King. Activity, life, and vigor, are conveied into
the sublunary creatures, by the influence of Heaven: but the malignity and
distemper, the cause of so many Epidemicall diseases, do proceed from the noy
some vapors of the earth, or some ill affected qualities of the air, without
any infection or alteration of those pure, celestial and incorruptible bodies.
In the like manner (he said) the authority, the power and countenance of
Princes may concur in the actions of evil men, without partaking in the
injustice and obliquitie of them. Hurtful projects presented to the King under
plausible notions.
These matters whereof we complain, have bin presented to his Majesty, either
under the pretense of Royal Prerogatives, which he is bound to maintain, or
of public good, which is the most honorable object of Regal wisdom. But the
covetous and ambitious designs of others, have interposed betwixt his Royal
intentions, and the happiness of his people, making those things pernicious and
hurtful, which his Majesty apprehended as just, and profitable.

He said, the things which he was to propound, were of a various A promise of

consideration, In handling of which, as he would be bold to use the liberty of
the place and relation wherein he stood, so he would be careful to express
that Modesty and humility, which might be expected by those, of whose actions
he was to speak. And if his judgment; Submission to reformation,
or his tongue should slip into a particular mistake, he would not think it
so great a shame, to fail by his own weakness, as he should esteem it an
honor and advantage, to be corrected by the wisdom of that house, to which he
submitted himself, with this protestation, that he desired no reformation so
much as to reform himself.

are laid upon the soul. The next great liberty, is Justice, whereby Justice.

of the kingdom, the highest Court: this is enabled by the Legislative and
Conciliary power, to prevent evils to come; by the Judiciary power, to
suppress and remove evils present. If you consider these three great liberties
in the order of dignity, this last is inferior to the other two, as means
are inferour to the end; but if you consider them in the order of necessity,
and use, this may justly claim the The order propounded in handling these
three great liberties.
first place, in our case, because the end cannot be obtained without the
means: if we do not preserve this, we cannot long hope to enjoy either of the
other. Therefore (he said) being to speak of those grievances which lie upon
the kingdom, he would observe this order.

1. To mention those, which were against the privilege of Parliaments. 2.
Those which were prejudicial to the Religion established in the Kingdom. 3.
Those which did interrupt the justice of the Realm, in the liberty of our
persons, and propriety of our estates.
The privileges of Parliament were not given for the ornament The necessity
and importance of the privilege of Parliament.
or advantage of those, who are the members of Parliament, they have a real
use and efficacy, toward that which is the end of Parliaments: we are free
from suits, that we may the more entirely addict our selves, to the public
services: we have therefore liberty of speech, that our Counsels may not be
corrupted with fear, or our judgments perverted with self respects: those
three great faculties and functions of Parliament, the Legislative, Judiciary,
and Consiliary power, can not be well exercised without such privileges as
these. The wisdom of our Laws, the faithfulness of our Counsels, the
righteousness of our judgments can hardly be kept pure and untainted, if they
proceed from distracted and restrained minds.

It is a good Rule of the Moral Philosopher, Et non laedas mentem
gubernatricem omnium actionum: These powers of Parliament are to the body
politic as the rational faculties of the soul, to a man* That which keeps
all the parts of the Commonwealth in frame* and temper, ought to be most
carefully preserved in that freedom vigor, and activity, which belongs to it
self. Our predecessors in this house, have ever bin most careful in the first
place, to settle and secure their privileges: and (he said) he hoped that we
having had greater breaches made upon us than heretofore, would be no less
tender of them, and forward in seeking reparation for that which is past, and
prevention of the like for the time to come.

Then he propounded diverse particular points wherein the Privilege Particular
breaches of privilege. 1 Restraint of speech. 2 Interdict of questions
of Parliament had bin broken.

First, in restraiaing the members of the House from speaking.

Secondly, in forbidding the Speaker to put any Question.

These two were practiced the last day of the last Parliament (and, as was
alleged, by his Majesty's command) and both of them trench upon the very life
and being of Parliaments, for if such a restraining power as this should take
root, and be admitted, it will be impossible for us to bring any resolution to
perfection in such matters as shall displease those about the King.

Thirdly, by imprisoning diverse Members of the House for matters Imprisonment

done in Parliament.

Fourthly, by indictments, informations, and judgments in ordinary and
inferior courts, for speeches and proceedings in Parliaments

Fifthly, the disgraceful order of the Kings Bench, whereby some members of
this House were enjoined to put in security of the good behavior, and for
refusal thereof, they were continued in prison, diverse years, without any
particular allegation against them: one of them was freed by death, others not
dismissed till his Majesty had declared his intention, to summon this
Parliament. And this he noted, not only as a breach of privilege, but as a
violation of the common justice of the Kingdom.

Sixthly by the sudden and abrupt dissolution of Parliaments, contrary Abrupt
dissolutions of Parliament.
to the Law and custom. It has bin often declared in Parliaments, that the
Parliament should not be dissolved, till the petitions be answered This (he
said) was a great grievance, because it does prevent the redress of other
grievances. It were a hard case, that a private man should be put to death
without being heard: As this representative body of the Commons, receives a
being by the summons, so it receives a civil death by the dissolution. Is it
not a much more heavy doom, by which we lose our being, and have this civil
death inflicted on us, in displeasure, and not to be allowed time and liberty
to answer for our selves? that we should not only dye, but have this mark of
infamy laid upon us, to be made Intestabiles, disabled to make our wills, to
dispose of our business, as this House has always used to do, before
Adjournments or dissolutions? yet this, has often bin our case, we have not
bin permitted to power out our last sighs and groans, into the bosom of our
dear Sovereign; the words of dying men are full of piercing affections: If we
might be heard to speak, no doubt we should so fully express our love, and
faith fulness to our Prince, as might take off the false suggestions and
aspersions of others: at least we should in our humble supplications, recommend
some such things to him in the name of his people as would make for his honor,
and the public good of his Kingdom.

Thus he concluded the first sort of grievances, being such as were Grievances
concerning Religion.
against the privilege of Parliament, and passed on to the next, concerning
Religion: all which he conveyed under the four heads.

1 The first, was the great encouragement given to popery, of Encouragement of
popery. Suspension of Laws.
which he produced these particular evidences.

1 A suspension of all Laws against Papists, whereby they enjoy a free, and
almost public exercise of that Religion, and those good Statutes which were
made for restraint of Idolatry, and superstition, are now a ground of security
to them, in the practice of both, being used to no other end, but to get money
into the Kings purse: which as it is clearly against the intentions of the
Law, so it is full of mischief to the Kingdom.

By this means a dangerous party is cherished, and increased, who are ready to
close with any opportunity of disturbing the peace and safety of the State.
Yet (he said) he did not desire any new laws against popery, or any rigorous
courses in the execution of those already in force; he was far from seeking the
ruin of their persons or estates, only he wished they might be kept in such
a condition, as should restrain them from doing hurt.

It may be objected, there are moderate and discreet men amongst There can be
no security from papists.

the Kingdom, as well as we. These (he said) were not to be considered
according to their own disposition, but according to but In their disability.
the nature of the body, whereof they are parties. The Planets have several
and particular motions of their own, yet they are all rapt and transported
into a contrary course, by the superior Orb which comprehends them all. The
Principles of Popery are such, as are incompatible with any other RELIGION:
there may be a suspension of violence, for some by respects, but the ultimate
end, even of that moderation, is, that they may with more advantage extirpate
that which is opposite to them. Laws will not restrain them, oaths will not,
the Pope can dispense with both these, and where there is occasion, his command
will act them, to the disturbance of the Realm, against their own private
disposition, yea, against their own reason and judgment to obey him, to whom
they have (especially the Jesuiticall party) absolutely and entirely obliged
themselves, not only in spiritual matters, but in temporal, as they are in
order ad Spiritualia. H. the 3d. and H. the 4th. of France, were no Protestants
themselves, yet were murdered, because they tolerated the Protestants, by
which and many other presidents it appears, that the King, that the Kingdom
can have no security but in their weakness and disabilitie to do hurt.

2 A 2d. encouragement is, their admission into places of power Admission into
places of power.
and trust in the Commonwealth, whereby they get many dependants and
adherents, not only of their own, but even of such as make profession to be
protestants.

3 A third, their freedom of resorting to London, and the Court, Free resort
to London and the court
whereby they have opportunity, not only of Communicating their Counsels, and
designs one to another, but of diving into his Majesty's Counsels, by the
frequent access of those who are active men, amongst them, to the tables and
company of great men, and under subtle pretenses and disguises, they want not
means of cherishing their own projects, and of endeavoring to mould and
biasse the public affairs to the great advantage of that party.

4 A 4th, that as they have a Congregation of Cardinals at Rome, to consider of
the aptest ways and means of establishing the Popes authority and Religion in
England: so they have a Nuncio here, to act and dispose that party to the
execution of those Counsels, and by the assistance of such cunning and
Jesuiticall spirits as swarm in this town, to order and manage all actions,
and events, to the furtherance of that maine end.

2 The second grievance in Religion, was from those manifold innovations lately
introduced into several parts of the Kingdom, all Innovations in matters of
Religion
inclining to Popery, and disposing and sitting men to entertain it: the
particulars are these. Maintenance of popish tenets.


1 Diverse of the chiefest points of Religion in difference betwixt us and the
Papists have bin publicly defended in licensed Books, in Sermons, in
University acts and disputations.

2 Diverse Popish Ceremonies have bin not only practiced, but Practice of
popish ceremonies.
countenanced, yea little less than enjoined, as Altars, Images, Crucifixes,
bowings, and other gestures and observances, which put upon our Churches a
shape and face of popery. He compared this to the dry bones in Ezekiel, first
they came together, then the sinews and the flesh came upon them, after this
the skin covered them, and then breath and life was put into them: so (he said)
after these men had molded us into an outward form and visage of popery, they
would more boldly endeavor to breath into us the spirit and life of popery.

3 The third grievance, was the countenancing and preferring those men, who
were most forward in setting up such Innovations, the Preferment of men
popishly inclined. Discouragment of true professors* Inlargment of differences
among our selves.
particulars were so well known, that they needed not to be named.

4 The fourth was, the discouragement of those who were known to be most
conscionable, and faithful professors of the truth: some of the ways of
effecting this, he observed to be these.

1. The courses taken to enforce and enlarge those unhappy differences, for
matters of small moment, which have bin amongst our selves, and to raise up new
occasions of further division, whereby many have bin induced to forsake the
land, not seeing the end of those voluntary and humane Injunctions in things
appertaining to Gods worship: whereas those who are indeed lovers of Religion,
and of the Churches of God, would seek to make up those breaches, and to unite
us more entirely against the common enemy.

2 The over rigid prosecution of those who are scrupulous in using Over-rigid
prosecution of the scrupulous for things indifferent.
some things enjoined, which are held by those who enjoin them, to be in
themselves indifferent. It has bin ever the desire of this House, expressed in
many Parliaments in Q. Elizabeth's time and since, that such might be tenderly
used. It was one of our petitions delivered at Oxford to his Majesty that now
is: but what little moderation it has produced, is not unknown to us all, any
other vice almost Unjust punishments for matters not by law. Reading the Book.
The Table set Altarwise. Coming to the railes Preaching upon the Lords day.
Varying from the catechism. Abuse of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
may be better endured in a Minister than Inconformitie.

3 The unjust punishments, and vexations of sundry persons for matters
required, without any warrant of Law: as

For not reading the book concerning recreation on the Lords day. For not
removing the Communion Table to be set Altarwise at the East end of the
Chancell.

For not coming up to the Railes to receive the Sacrament.

For preaching the Lords day in the afternoon.

For Catechizing in any other words and manner than in the precise words of the
short catechism in the Common Prayer book.

The fifth and last grievance concerning Religion, was the incroachment and
abuse of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction: the particulars mentioned are these.

1 Fining and imprisoning in cases not allowed by Law.

2 Their challenging their jurisdiction to be appropriate to their In fining
and imprisoning Claiming jurisdiction to be Iure Divino. Articles of the
Visitations.
order, which they allege to be jure Divino.

3 The contriving and publishing of new articles, upon which they enforce the
Churchwardens to take oaths, and to make inquiries and presentiments, as if
such articles had the force of Canons: and this, he said, was an effect of
great presumption and boldness, not only in the Bishops, but in their
Archdeacons, Officials and Chancellors, taking upon themselves a kind of
Synodall authority: and the Injunctions of this kind, might well partake in
name with that part of the common Law, which is called the Extravagants.

Having dispatched these several points, he proceeded to the third Grievances
concerning the liberty of persons and estates.
part of grievances, being such as are against the common justice of the Realm,
in the liberties of our persons, and propriety of our estates, of which (he
said) he had many to propound: In doing whereof, he would rather observe the
order of time, wherein they were acted, than of consequence: but when he
should come to the cure, he should then persuade the House to begin with
those, who were of most importance, as being now in execution, and very much
pressing and exhausting the Commonwealth.

He began with the Tonnage and poundage, and other impositions Tonnage and
Poundage impositions
not warranted by Law: and because these burdens had long lain upon us, and the
principles which produced them, are the same from whence diverse others are
derived, he thought it necessary to premise a short narrative, and relation of
the grounds and proceedings of the power of imposing herein pracised. It was

contract which he made Acknowledged by the Conqueror. Sometimes broken by
other Kings but never denied. Those breaches repaired by succeeding Parliaments.

in the Laws which he published.

This has never bin denied to any of our Kings, though broken and interrupted
by some of them, especially by K. John, and Hen. 3. then again confirmed by
Mag. Chart. and other succeeding laws: yet not so well settled, but that it was
sometime attempted by the two succeeding Edwards, in whose times the subjects
were very sensible of all the breaches made upon the common liberty, and by
the opportunity of frequent Parliaments, pursued them with fresh complaints,
and for the most part, found redress, and procured the right of the subject to
be fortified by new Statutes.

He observed that those Kings, even in the Acts whereby they did Some mixture

break the Law, did really affirm the subjects liberty, and disclaim that
right of imposing, which is now chale^ged, for they did usually procure the
Merchants consent, to such taxes as were laid, thereby to put a color of
justice upon their proceeding, and ordinarily they were limited to a short
time, and then propounded to the ratification of the Parliament, where they
were cancelled or confirmed, as the necessity and state of the Kingdom did
require.

But for the most part, such charges upon merchandise, were taken The grant by

lesser proportion, as was requisite for supply of the public occasions, 6 or

in the power of Parliament, that they At first variously limited in respect of

practice between Ed. 3 and Q Mary

for that use. Afterward they were granted to the King for life, and so
continued for diverse descents, yet still as a gift and grant of the Commons.

Betwixt the time of Ed. the third, and Q. Mary, never Prince (that he could
remember) offered to demand any imposition, but by grant in Parliament: Q. Mary

upon Nicholsons project, there was a further addition of charge, but still upon

In Q. Eliz. time, one or two little impositions crept in, the general Bates

prosperity of her reign overshadowing small errors and innovations: one of
these was upon Currants, by occasion of the Merchants complaints, that the
Venetians had laid a charge upon the English cloth, that so we might be even
with them, and force them the sooner to take it off: this being demanded by K.
James, was denied The judgment therein for the King.
by one Bates a Merchant, and upon a suit in the Exchequer, was adjudged for
the King.

The manner of which judgment was thus: There were then but three Judges, in
that Court, all differing from one another in the grounds of their sentences.
The first was of opinion, the King might impose upon such commodities as were
foreign, and superfluous Resulting from different opinions of the Judges.
as Currants were, but not upon such as were native, and to be transported, or
necessary, and to be imported for the use of the kingdom. The second Judge was
of opinion, he might impose upon all foreign Merchandise, whether superfluous
or no, but not upon native. The third, that for as much as the King had the
custody of the Ports and the guard of the Seas, and that he might open and shut
up the ports as he pleased, he had a prerogative to impose upon all
Merchandise, both exported and imported.

This single, distracted and divided judgment, is the foundation of The only

upon all commodities outward and inward, not limited to a certain time, and

first, impositions in fee simple, that were followed with complaints, and
preserved by breaches of Parliaments
ever heard of in this kingdom. This judgment, and the right of imposing
thereupon assumed was a question in septimo and duodecimo of that King, and was
the cause of the breach of both those Parliaments, In 18. and 21. Jacobi, it
was declined by this House, that they might preserve the favor of the K. for
the dispatch of some other great businesses, upon which they were more especially
attentive.

proposition on the Kings part, for renewing the bill of Tonnage and Poundage,
but so moderate was that Parliament, that they thought rather to confirm the
impositions already set by a law to be made, than to abolish them by a
judgment in Parliament, but that and diverse ensuing Parliaments have been
unhappily broken, before that endeavor could be accomplished, only at the last
meeting, a Remonstrance was made concerning the liberty of the Subject, in this
point, and it has always been expressed to be the meaning of the House, and so
it was (as he said) his own meaning in the proposition now made, to settle
and restore the right according to law, and not to diminish the Kings profit,
but to establish it by a free grant in Parliament. New burdens since the last
Parliaments.

are all taken by Prerogative, without any grant in Parliament, or authority of
law, as we conceive, from whence diverse inconveniences and mischiefs are
produced.

1. The danger of the president, that a judgment in one Court, The Kingdom

hindered, the commodities of our own, grows extremely abased, and those
imported much inhaunsed, all which lies not upon the Merchant alone, but upon
the generality of the subject, and by this means the stock of the Kingdom is
much diminisht, our exportation being less profitable, and our importation
more chargeable. And if the wars and troubles in the neighbor parts had not
brought almost the whole stream of Trade into this Kingdom, we should have
found many more prejudicial effects of these impositions, long before this
time, than yet we have done; especially they To the American plantations

have been insupportable to the poor plantations, whither many of his
Majesty's subjects have been transported, in diverse parts of the Continent, and
Islands of America, being a design tending to the honor of the Kingdom, and
the enlargement of his Majesty's dominions: The adventurers in this noble
work, have for the most part, no other support but Tobacco, upon which, such a
heavy rate is set, that the King receives twice as much, as the true value of
the commodity to the owner.

5 Whereas these great burdens have caused diverse Merchants Impositions upon
trade intercoursory.
to apply themselves to a way of traffic abroad by transporting goods from
one Country to another, without bringing them home into England. It has been
lately endeavored to set an Imposition upon this trade: so as the King will
have a duty out of those commodities which never came within his dominions, to
the great discouragement of such active and industrious men.

The next general head of Civil grievances, was enforcing men Compositions
for Knighthood
to compound for Knighthood, which though it may seem past, because it is
diverse years since it was used, yet upon the same grounds the King may renew
it, as often as he pleases, for the composition looks backward, and the
offense continuing, is subject to a new fine. The state of that business, he
laid down thus.

Heretofore when the services due by tenure, were taken in kind The Original
ground of the charg
it were fit there should be some way of trial, and approbation of those, that
were bound to such services. Therefore it was ordained, that such as were to do
Knights service, after they came of age, and had possession of their lands, and
should be made Knights, that is, publicly declared, to be fit for that
service, diverse ceremonies and solemnities were in use for this purpose; and if
by the parties neglect this was not done, he was punishable by Fine: there
being in those times an ordinary and open way to get Knighthood, for those who
were borne to it.

Although the use of this has for diverse ages been discontinued, yet there
have past very few Kings, under whom there has not bin An old grievance in the
kind,
a general Summons, requiring those who had lands of such value as the Law
prescribes, to appear at the Coronation, or some other great solemnity, and to
be Knighted, and yet nothing intended but New in the manner and excess,
the getting of some small fines: so as this grievance is not altogether new in
the kind, though it be new in the manner, and in the excess of it, and that in
diverse respects.

1 First, It has been extended beyond all intention of and color of law, not
only Inne-holders, but likewise Lease-holders, Copyholders, Merchants and

yet distresses infinite were made out against them; and issues increased and
multiplied, and no way open to discharge those issues, by plea or otherwise,

this, were diverse popish Recusants, men of estate and quality, such as in
likelihood did not only aim at their private gain, but that by this open

ways of Parliament men more thoroughly obstructed. Amongst the infinite

has a judgment past for it, yet in truth it is thereby aggravated, if it be
considered, that Aggravated not supported by the Judgment. Which is not
grounded upon any law custom president or authority of law books.
that judgment is founded upon the naked opinion of some judges, without any

forbidden to build, other after great trouble and vexation, have been forced to

to a new question as before, for it is agreed by all, that the King cannot
license a common Nuisance: and although indeed these are not such, yet it is a
matter of very ill consequence, that under that name they should be compounded
for, and may in ill times be made a president for the Kings of this Realm to
claim a power of licencing such things as are Nusances indeed.

by Letters from the Council Table, and sometimes (such has been the boldness
and presumption of some men) by the order of the Lord Lievtenants, or deputy
Leivtenant alone.

This is a growing evil still multiplying and increasing from a few
particulars to many, from small sums to great: it began A growing evil. Coat

for this it has some countenance, from the use in Q Eliz. time, when the Lords
of the Council did often desire the deputy Lievtenants to procure so much money
to be laid out in the Country as the service did require, with a promise to pay
it again in London; for which purpose there was a constant warrant in the
Exchequer. This (he said) was the practice in her time, and in a great part of
K James, and the payments so certain, as it was little otherwise, than taking
up money upon bills of exhange; at this day they follow these presidents, in the
manner of the demand (for it is with a promise of a repayment) but not in the
certainty and readiness of satisfaction.

The first particular brought into a tax (as he thought) was the Muster masters

Muster Masters wages, at which many repined, but being for small sums, it
began to be generally digested: yet in the last Parliament, this House was
sensible of it, and to avoid the danger of the president that the Subjects
should be forced to make any payments without consent in Parliament, they
thought upon a Bill that may be a rule to the Lieutenants what to demand, and
to the People what to pay. But the hopes of this Bill were dashed in the
dissolution of that Parliament. Now of late diverse other particulars are
growing into practice, which make the grievance much more heavy: those
mentioned were these.

is to be taken by all those of the Kings Counsel, in which amongst other
things it is expressed, that they should for no cause forbear to do right, to
all the Kings people, and if such an oath be not now taken, he wished it might

might give strength and countenance to Monopolies, as it has not been used
till now of late, so it cannot be apprehended without the just grief of the
honest subject, and encouragement of those who are ill affected.

to set a face of right upon these things, which are unlawful in their own
nature: a face of public good, upon such as are pernicious in Applied the

would say no more but this, that when he saw him at his Bar, in the most
humble dejected posture, The offense of D. Mannering.

corrupt the Kings Conscience, and as much as in them lies, to deprive the
people of that Royal protection, to which his Majesty is bound by the
fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and his own personal Oath.

The thirteenth: The long intermission of the Parliaments, contrary The

from whence these grievances issued, were as hurtful to the King, as to the

be betwixt the King and His People, in matters of grace and supply.

They have need of him by His general pardon, to be secured from projectors,
and informers, to be freed from obsolete Laws, from the subtle devices of
such as seek to restrain the Prerogative to their own private advantage, and
the public hurt; and he has need of them for counsel and support, in great
and extraordinary occasions. This mutual intercourse would so weane the
affections and interests of His Subjects, into his actions and designs, that
their wealth and their persons would be his, his own estate would be managed
to most advantage, and public undertakings would be prosecuted at the charge
and adventure of the Subject: The Victorious attempts in Queen ELIZABETH'S time
upon Portugal, Spain, and the Indies, were for the greatest part, made upon
the poor Subjects purses, and not upon the Queens, though the Honor and
profit of the success, did most accrue to her.

disadvantage his treaties and alliances.

3 The apprehension of the favor and encouragement given to By weakening his

Popery, has much weakened his Majesty's party beyond the Sea, and impared that
advantage which Queen Elizabeth and His Royal Father has heretofore made, of
being heads of the Protestant union.

subjects to leave the kingdom.
the Land, whereby not only their persons, and their posterity, but their
wealth, and their industry are lost to this Kingdom, much to the demolishing
of His Majesty's Customs and Subsidies. Amongst other inconveniences, this was
especially to be observed, that diverse Clothiers driven out of the Country,
had set up the manufacture of Cloth beyond the Seas, whereby this State is like
to suffer much by abatement of the price of Woolls, and by want of employment
for the poor, both which likewise tend to his Majesty's particular loss.

5 It puts the King upon unproper ways of supply, which being By unproper
ways of supply.
not warranted by Law, are much more burdensome to the subject, than
advantageous to his Majesty. In France not long since, upon a survey of the
Kings Revenue, it was found that two parts in three, never came to the Kings
purse, but were diverted to the profit of the officers or Ministers of the
Crown, and it was thought a very good service and reformation, to reduce two
parts to the King, leaving still a third part to the Instruments as were
employed about getting it in. It may well be doubted, that the King may have
the like or worse success in England: which appears already in some
particulars.

The King has reserved upon this Monopoly of Wines, 30 thousand Pound Rent a
year, the Vintner paies 40. Shillings a Tun, which comes to Ninty thousand
pounds: the price upon the Subject by retaile, is increased Two pence a Quart,
which comes to Eight pound a Tun, and for 45000. Tun brought in yearly,
amounts to 3. hundred 60. thousand pounds, which is 3. hundred and 30. thousand
pounds loss to the Kingdom, above the Kings Rent; other Monopolies, as that
of Soape, have been very chargeable to the kingdom, and brought very little
Treasure into his Majesty's Coffers.

The Law provides for that revenue of the Crown; which is Natural and proper,
that it may be safely collected, and brought to Account, but this illegal
Revenue, being without any such provision, is left to hazard, and much
uncertainty, either not to be retained, or not duly accounted of.

they be left uncertain: whether they shall reap the benefit of their own
pains, and hazard those who are brought into the Condition of slaves, will
easily grow to a slavish disposition, who having nothing to lose, do commonly
show more boldness in disturbing, than in defending a kingdom.

7 These irregular Courses do give opportunity to ill Instruments By
introducing ill Instruments into the Kings service.
to insinuate themselves into the Kings service, for we cannot but observe,
that if a man be officious in furthering their inordinate burdens of Ship
money, Monopolies, and the like: it varnisheth over all other faults, and makes
him fit both for Employment and preferment: So that out of their offices, they
are furnished for vast expenses, purchases, Buildings; and the King loses often
more in desperate debts at their deaths, than he got by them all their lives,
whether this were not lately verified in a Western man, much employed while he
lived, he leaves to the Knowledge of those who were acquainted with his Course,
and he doubted not but others might be found in the like case.

Those that are affected to Popery, to profaneness, and to superstitious
innovations, in matters of Religion. All kind of Spies and intelligencers have
means to be countenanced and trusted if they will be but zealous in these
kind of services, which how much it detracts from His Majesty, in honor, in
profit and prosperity of public affairs, lies open to every man's
apprehension: and from these reasons or some of them, he thought it proceeded
that through the whole course of the English story it might be observed, that
those Kings who had bin most respectfull of the Laws, had bin most eminent in
greatness, in Glory and success, both at home and abroad; and that others,
who thought to subsist by the violation of them, did often fall into a state of
weakness, poverty, and Infortunitie.

8 The differences and discontents betwixt his Majesty, and the By diverting
the KINGS thoughts from diverse great and hopeful enterprises.
people at home, have in all likelihood diverted his Royal thoughts and
Counsels from those great opportunities which he might have, not only to
weaken the House of Austria, to restore the Palatinate, but to gain to himself
a higher pitch of power and greatness, than any of his Ancestors.

It is not unknown how weak, how distracted, how discontented the Spanish
Colonies are in the West Indies. There are now in those parts in New England,
Virginia, and the Caribe-Islands, and in the Barmudos, at least 60000 able
persons of this Nation, many of them well armed, and their bodies seasoned to
that Climate, which with a very small charge might be set down in some
advantageous parts of these pleasant, rich and fruitful Countries, and easily
make his Majesty Master of all that treasure, which not only foments the war,
but is the great support of Popery in all parts of Christendom.

9 Lastly, Those courses are apt to produce such distempers in the By producing

state, as may not be settled without great charge and loss, by which means
more may be consumed in a few months than shall be gotten by such ways in
many years.

Having past through the two first general Branches, he was now come to the
third, wherein he was to set down the ways of healing The ways of remedying
their grievances.
and removing those grievances, which consisted of two maine Branches, first in
declaring the Law where it was doubtful: The second in better provision for
the execution of Law, where it is clear: But (he said) because he had already
spent much time, and began to find some confusion in his Memory, he would refer
the particulars to another opportunity, and for the present only move that,
which was general to all, and would give weight and advantage to all the
particular ways of redress; that is, that we should speedily desire a
Conference with the Lords, and acquaint them with the Miserable condition
wherein we find the Church and State, and as we have already resolved to join
in a religious seeking of God, in a day of fast and humiliation, so to entreat
them to concur with us, in a Parliamentary course, of petitioning the King as
there should be occasion, and in searching out the causes and remedies of
these many insupportable grievances under which we lie, that so by the united
wisdom and authority of both Houses, such courses may be taken, as (through
Gods blessing) may advance the honor and greatness of His Majesty, and
restore and establish the peace and prosperity of the Kingdom.

This (he said) We might undertake with comfort and hope of success: for
though there be a darkness upon the Land, a thick and palpable darkness,
like that of Egypt; yet as in that, the Sun had not lost his light, nor the
Egyptians their sight, the interruption was only in the Medium, so with us
there is still (God be thanked) light in the Sun, Wisdom and Justice in His
Majesty to dispell this darkness, and in us there remains a visuall faculty,
whereby we are enabled to apprehend, and moved to desire light, and when we
shall be blessed in the enjoying of it, we shall thereby be incited to return
His Majesty such thanks, as may make it shine more clearly in the world, to
His own glory, and in the hearts of his people, to their joy and contentment.

FINIS.
