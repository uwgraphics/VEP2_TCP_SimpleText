A New Scotch Ballad: CALLED BOTHWEL-BRIDGE: OR, Hamilton's HERO.
To the Tune of Fortune my Foe.
1.
WHen valiant Bucklugh charged his Foes,
And put the Rebel Scots to fight,
Full many a Gallant Squire arose
And rushed into the Fight.
2.
From sturdy Mars they all did spring,
And by the Dint of Spur and Switch
Could make their Steeds to kick and fling,
And leap over Enemy like Ditch.
3.
But lo! amidst this furious Train
Of matchless Wights, appeared one
With Courage and with Prowess main
As ever yet was shown.
4.
Of Visage dark as day of Doom,
Most pitifully rent and tore,
Shows him a Warrier in the Womb
That Wounds received e're he was bore,
5.
His Breast all Steel, of Temper tuff,
And Falstaff's Belly decked with Charms,
With Brandon's Head, all clad in Buff,
Secure from Scottish Arms.
6.
Full six Foot deep in Stature he,
A goodly sight for to behold,
Of Parentage and Pedigree
Most wondrous to unfold.
7.
Not generous Whore, of better kind,
Nor Stallion stout, of Mettle higher
Than is the fierce undaunted mind
Of this our lofty Squire.
8.
But, that you may believe, his Race
Was such as we dare brag on,
Know to St. George he Kinsman was,
and Son and Heir to the Dragon.
9.
From that bold Knight he Valor gained,
And from the Venom of this Sire
The gift of swelling he obtained,
And eke of spitting Fire.
10.
At two Months Age, from Mothers Paps,
He sucked out Bullets 'stead of Milk;
Which rolling in his Warlike Chaps
They turned as soft as Silk.
11.
With this rank Food he fed some years
Till he so strong a Stomach got,
That he could swallow down whole Spears*
And mumble Canon-shot.
12.
Did he but hear those Furies roar
He Would rush into the heat of Battle,
And bowze Combustion from the Bore
As 'twere from mouth of Sucking-bottle.
13.
No Armor needful was in fight,
Nor cared he for the Powerful shield;
He valued Courage not a Doit
To man him in the dreadful Field.
14.
For let the whiffling Bullets stray,
It Is no matter whether thick or thinner,
His only business was to pray
They Would shoot him down his Dinner.
15.
THus dyetted, against Scottish Loon,
He proudly troopt by Monmouth's side,
Accouter'd with a Knife and Spoon
Which all their Arms defied.
16.
But as the Duke right manfully
Marched on his stubborn Foes to meet,
He all besh -- the Shot which he
So likely was to eat.
17.
Behind his Grace he tamely slunk,
(Supposed) from Wounds his Breech to keep:
And at each thundering Volley shrunk
Like Hog-Louse in a Heap.
18.
Most pittiously he there did shrugg,
And cursed a thousand times damned Mars,
Then popt down head to save each Lugg
And worshipped Royal A --
19.
Full sore he stunk whilst helter skelter,
He heard the Ammunition skim,
For still as he would seek new shelter
Fear, like Gun-stick, scow'rd him.
20.
Yet did our Hero 'scape the Brunt,
Through Ghostly Skill to disappear,
For, like a Duck, he dived in the Front,
And rose again in the Rear.
21.
Where, safe as a Surgeon in the Hold,
With Sweard sharp set for cruel Blow
He huff'd and puffed, looked big and bold,
And stroak'd the Soil where Beard should grow.
22.
Then with his trusty Whynnyard he,
All man, Sir, slashing through the Air,
Cried, like the Tailor to the Tree,
Here I could have you, Sir, -- and there --
23.
Thus did he brandishing proceed,
Till the desperate Warlike Minion
Made the individual Attoms bleed,
And peeled them like an Onion.
24.
This without pity too to spare
Those which he breathed, as if he meant
Revenge on the Philosopher
That says, Our World is accident.
25.
His waiting Genius, eke also
With world of pains, and muckle do,
From Scabbard Salted, as I trow,
A pickled Weapon drew.
26.
To Lord and Master true he stuck,
And ventured full as hard as he;
For 'twas the way to meet good luck,
And be from dangers free.
27.
The lusty Loon came on behind,
And in his mighty Cloak-bag caught
That Courage blown away by the VVind,
With which the Esquire should have fought.
28.
The sprightly Wallet 'gan to jump,
Possessed with these Almighty Charms,
And, bidding long-farewell to Rump,
Was in a moment up in Arms.
29.
The noble Champion bravely then
Began to smile and take good cheer,
'Twas time to lay about him when
Portmanteau turned a Volunteer.
30.
Martch on, my Darlings then, quoth he;
For lo! the Battel's at a stand,
And it is ordained that only we
Should tame this uncouth Land.
31.
This said, into a Body they
With Marshall Skill drew up their Force,
Consisting, as you heard me say,
Of Cloak-bag and two Horse.
32.
But ah! alack, and weel-a-day!
The Canny Duke (God bless his Grace)
E're these three Wights could reach their prey,
Had laid it dead upon the place.
33.
The Squire, all Fury, took it ill,
For sorely he began to maunder,
And 'cause he left no Foes to kill
Wept out like Alexander.
34.
Yet when he ceased to sob and frown,
Quoth he, What though the Kerns are slain?
To save my Honor and Renown
I Will kill them over again.
35.
With that his Punnyard forth he draws,
(Thus Death himself proved mortal too)
For napping in a dead man's Jaws
He ran him through and through.
36.
This was his Zeal and Loyalty,
And fear of being Credit-shamm'd,
He garr'd each Treacherous Scot twice dee*
In hopes he might be double damned.
37.
Thus too St. George he has overcome,
And stabbed the mighty Hero's Fame,
Honor he leaves him not a Crum,
All Is due to -- 's Name.
38.
He now as England's Champion raigns;
It Is he alone is born to rule,
To bind the Qarrelsome in Chains,
And call a Giant Fool.
FINIS.
