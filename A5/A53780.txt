By Order from Mr Vice Chancellor.
THese are to give notice, that whereas Thomas Dye and John Fosset, have
without License from Me, and in contempt of the Chancellor, Masters and
Scholars of this University (to whom the Ordering and Governing of all Carriers
of what kind soever, Trading to or with the University and City of Oxford, does
of Right belong) presumed to set up a Coach to Travail from hence to London:
These are to require all Scholars, Privileged Persons and Members of this
University, not to Travail in the said Coach set up by Thomas Dye and John
Fosset, nor to send Letters or any Goods whatsoever by the aforesaid Coach.

P. MEWS Vice-Chan.
Oxford Feb. 22. 1671.
