MUNDORUM EXPLICATIO OR, The Explanation of an Hieroglyphical FIGURE: Wherein
are couched the Mysteries of the External, Internal, and Eternal Worlds,
showing the true progress of a Soul from the Court of Babylon to the City of
Jerusalem; from the Adamical fallen state to the Regenerate and Angelical.

Being A Sacred POEM, written by S. P. Armig.

Through Faith we understand that the Worlds ((...)) were framed by the Word of
God, so that things that are seen, were not made of things that do appear, Heb.

Created Heir of all things, by whom he made the Worlds, Heb. 1. 2. O homo, quid

INTO THE SACRED TREASURY OF THE IMACULATE LAMB OF GOD THE HOLY JESUS: KING OF
ALL THE WORLDS AND MAN'S REDEEMER THE MOST UNWORTHY OF HIS SERVANTS HUMBLY
PROSTRATE IN ALL HUMILITY BEGS LEAVE TO CAST THIS HIS SMALL MITE.

THE PREFACE.
CHRISTIAN Religion is summed up in these two words: LOVE God with all thy
Heart, and thy Neighbor as thy self. Here indeed lies contracted the whole LAW
of God, and of Nature. There are not many Volumns of Acts and Statutes to be
observed, nor need man's memory be much burdened with the number of Doctrines
and Commands: They are few and Natural; easy and plain. They are all
contracted into one word LOVE: and what more natural appetite is there then
that? Vhat is Natural is easy, what easy, is plain. Man in his primarie state
and Condition was created with this appetite Love, as the means whereby he
might enjoy the felicity he was created to; He naturally loved God his Creator,
and Fountain from whence he sprung; as it is still natural for all Creatures
to Love their Original, which is their Natural appetite not depraved. Now God
requires no more of man, but that he follow that first institution and appetite
of true Nature for which he was Created, which was to Love God, and that since
his fellow Creatures were multiplied, that that natural appetite of Love should
also be branc^ed forth to them, as a part of Man's self: so that the one has
relation to our souls enjoyment, the other to our living rightly; that is
Godly, soberly, righteously. But Man being created a free Agent, whilst in
Paradise, this natural appetite grew weak, and through his dis^^dience became
depraved, and fell to lower Objects, which as a Curse inherently sticks on all
his posterity, so that Man is apt to Love the base and terrene things of this
world better than his Creator, and the more sublime of the other World. This is
the reason Man disobeys God, and hurts himself; for the strongest Love causes
the strickest obedience; so that did we love God, we should obey him, and did
we truly love our selves, we should not sin against our Neighbor, for what
ever injury we do to him, the Law of (...), giv^s him a retaliating power to do
to us; though the strict Rules of the Go^^^l an^ of C^ri^^inity teaches better.
Now (...) to Lov^ and serve God is the end of all Religion: what need there be
so many Disputes, and alterations concerning the m^an^s of ^o ^hip, and forms
of Religion? whilst man busies himself in those outward Quarrels, and
D^fferences he looses the substance and ma^row of his Religion, and instead of
a f^^ling Love of God finds only a moral No^ion of Him. Aw^y then with the
Names of sects, of Churches, and more Holy and separate Congregations of Men,
and let all p^esse after this Love of God, and Charity to our Neighbor, to do
to Him as we would have him do to us, and to live with a good Conscience under
those Laws, and forms, as our superiors by the special Providence of God are
permitted to impo^e upon us, which we ought to do if such L^wes and Forms are
no ways a hinderance to th^s Command of Loving God; It is in e^d that
di^^utative and wrangling Spirit which has lately seized on this part of the
World, that ^as dampt Man's Love to God, and Ch^^ity toward his Neighbor;
every one imposing on the l^berty and Conscience of another what a^p^ars Truth
to himself. They forget to write this on the Table of their memories ab alio
expectes alteri quod feceris, for did they, they would Con^^der, that Man's
Conscience is not to b^ forced, the worship of God ought to be free: and that
there is an unchangeable and Eternal Law wrote by the (...) of God in the Heart
of every man by which he shall receive his Condemnation if (...); by which the
Heathens are inexc^sable, and must b^ brought to Judgment. Christ the Savior
of mankind ca^e not into the World to abrogate this Law, but to confirm it, to
make it m^re excellent, and to polish it by his Pr^cepts and Doctrine, whereby
it might become more easy, and more to the Capacity of man. Therefore to live
according to the Rules an^ Pr^c^pts of Christ, and to be a true Chris^ian, is
to Live according to the Rules of Nature sublime^, by the Doctrine of Jesus.
But the Devil that sub^le Enemy of mankind has ev^r made the way of a Christian
to seem so hard, and ^o repugnant to the Laws of Nature that it has almost
affright^d flesh and blood to enter upon it, when indeed it is the most genuine
and natural ^ath that can be ^rod, both to the satisfaction of the Soul, and
Body. Indeed to Nature d^praved, from its first institution and purity, (...)
with the vicious enormities of hellish (...), and of that dark Sphere, the way
of a Christian must seem hard, and intolerable, and in that regard strait is
the Way, and ^^rrow is the Gate that lea^s to Life Eternal. Through the cunning
instigation of the Devil, Man being in the state of fallen or depraved Nature,
and finding the outward World, with all its pleasurable baits and alluren^ents
so gr^eable and corre^^ondent to this depraved Nature, and to his senses, he is
content to live ^herein, and superficially to worship God un^er a few Notions,
and (...), about which he much troubles hi^^elf, when indeed h^ ought to
worship God in Spirit and in ^r^th, which is to L^ve him with the whole Heart,
and to obey him entirely; therefore he must put off this whole Nature and be
cloat^ed an^w, which is the (...) and narrow way of C^rcumcision, and then,
that Light or Eternal Law written in his Heart will direct him to live holily
before God, and uprightly toward men. Man being a sensible Creature, as well
as rational, is in both capacities depraved and fallen; This world and the
things thereof falling under the senses, whereby they are busied, and the Soul
hinder^d from more internal Contemplations, is indeed the great Engine whereby
the Devil captivates so many, that they have not time to consider the nature of
their souls, or the state of other worlds. They have some slight and
sup^rficial Notions, and Ideas of them, which they receive from the dictates of
others, and with which they content themselves, and rest satisfie^, never
understanding the deep mysteries contained in themselves. Did man search the
profundity of himself, he would find a great mystery, and then ^his
Hieglyphical Figure would not seem so great a Paradox as I question not but it
will do to some. There are some things in it which will seem st^a^ge and new,
and which does not quadrate wholly with what is generally received: but since
there is no difference in any fundamental p^rt of our faith in Christ Jesus,
all may read it though of different opinions without offense. CHRIST the great
Exemplar of Holiness and of Cobriety, is here set out to be the Pattern of all
Christians to walk after, and though it is not to be expected that any can
arrive to so sublime a pitch which ^e in being both God and man arrived at, yet
Man may attain to that degree of perfection in this Life as to walk uprigh^ly,
holily, and devoutly before God, and justly and blamelesly before men. Religion
is not a m^e^ notional knowledge of God, but a practical fe^ling of him, non
magna Ioquimur sed vi^i^ur, ^t us live well rat^er than talk well, for
knowledge without practice will but increase our cond^mnation in that great
day, and will but witness against us to our prejudice. Nor can Ignorance be an
excuse to any since God has given and Understanding and Capacity as a tall^nt
to every m^n, to know and do enough for his own salvation, and which ought to
be improved more or l^sse according to the value of his Tallent, and not
sluggi^hly to be cast aside in a Napkin, or laid out in f^volous, and
unprofitable Things; The great helps Christians have above others, for that
improvement, will call for a greater ^ncrease of their Tallents, and greater
will their condemnation be for their neglects. It is therefore out of that
consideration and not ou^ of any fantastic desire and itch of writing) that I
have p^nn'd this following discourse, being the explanation of an
Hierogliphical Figure of the Worlds, which came into my hands, another being
the Author: That I might not stifle that internal motion which prompted me to
it, though it was done without intention of making it public: But having
p^ssed the test of better Judgments than my own and approv^d, I have sent it
forth, in that rude dr^ss as it fell from my hasty Pen, without other Ornaments
and flatteries of Rheto^ick, and Lang age, than what was natural and becoming,
(...) more secret parts from rude and profa^e eyes. If that my good intention
of awakening others to look after those Worlds most still ignore, and blindly
grope after, and seriously to consider the immortality of their souls, and of
the Eternal fel^cities or everlasting Torments, they hereafter m^st enjoy, take
effect, I shall think my self happy, if not, I have done my duty, and my peace
will be my Reward.

AN ENCOMIUM On I. B. and his Interperer I. Sparrow Esquire wrote in Latin, and
thus rendered into English.
GReat Saint! tho I not in the Rubric see*
Thy Name; in verse I may remember Thee.
By whom we profit it is good to own;
By thee I must confess I much have known.
Of God, Heaven, Nature; we the secrets know
By thy choice works; they mystic Wonders show.
Thy Works do show the way to Paradise,
To the blessed Kingdoms of Aeternal ^oys:
The Sons of Wisdom only read thee right;
By Day the Wise read thee; the unwise by Night.
Treasures and Gemms are opened to their mind
Whilst these an Abyss of thick d^^knesse find:
Nor let them blame thee for the faults their own,
It Is their dark minds see not when plainly shown.
^^oud Man, and Covetous Sophist vain, take heed,
^ost thou the sacred Works of Behman read?
(...) World^ing, you
The (...) too?
The outside of the Book yo^ only see;
N^^ B^h^^n's m^nd, nor sacred Mystery:
Over (...) hang p^^chy Va^les, what there
You see, to you ou^ (...).
B^^ when yo^ w^se, and (...) read; his mind
A (...), and Ligh^ you find.
For you, the p^tchy (...) ay,
(...)
God's Spi^it's the Key; the (...) ins^^ration's showed:
D^v^ne he was in humane Science rude.
The s^cred Flame within his Breast did shine
When that H^ penned such mysteries Divine.
'Twas God himself who d^d his Hand direct
Who do^^ the Infant, and the wise respect.
God was his Master, it was he alone
That made to him such mystic Wonders known;
And the ^^cana's of the Wo^lds did ^he^
Bo^^ of the Light, the Dark, and this World too.
To Him the mystic Tongue of Nature's given,
Tha^, and the true Cabal ^s showed from Heaven.
Tha mystic Tongue was Known in Paradise,
And He like A^am Knew those mysteries.
W^thin the Center of his Breast divine
(...) the Sun of Righteousness did shine.
When that he wrote his ch^^st B^east used to be
Filled with the Spirit of the Deity.
F^e biting Cr^tick, and evil ton^ues, that Prate
'Gain^t Behman, and his Works Calumniate.
Woe to B^as^^emers; To the ^^ting Tongue
W^o to the Sa^^ts and all good men do wrong.
Beca^s^ a simple Laick, shall he be
(May Not God choose whom he please) contemned by thee
Do not his Works for new-Coyn'd Words d^sp^se,
May Not God, who all words made, new Words devise?
Will Wise men Gemms in earthen Platters scorn?
Or Wisdom' cause her Robes are old, and torn?
Bark on ^ll Tongues, that Him bespa^ter so,
Yet (...) ^alm under its ^eight shall grow.
His ^alm shall flouri^^ and it (...) may,
(...)
Show n^g^t to ill Men, and to goo^ Men Day.
To ho^y Men with their (...) l^ght,
They show the ^ay to (...), and Heaven aright.
I warn the scoff^r (...)
Thou Behman's (...)no more.
Now holy Soul these (...)
Which at thy shrine is offered by my Love.
And though these perish may, thy N^me shall be
A living Monument, as well as thee.
In Heaven thou liv'st, for ever there: But here
Whilst the World lasts, thou in thy works shin'st clear.
Great Saint we thus si^g forth out thanks below,
Which are just debt^, for what thou did bestow.
And learned Sparrow we thy praises too
Will sing; Rewards too small for what is due.
The gifts of Glory, and of Praise we owe:
The English Behman does thy T^ophies show.
Whilst English men that great Saints praise declare,
Thy Name shall joined with Hi^ receive a share:
The Time shall come when h^s great Name shall rise,
Thy Glory also shall ascend the Skies.
Thou made him English speak: or else what Good
Had his works done us if not understood?
To Germany they beneficial prove
Alone; till we enjoyed them by thy Love.
Their German-Robes thou took'st from them, that we
Their Beauties, might in English Ga^ments see.
Thus has thy Love a vast ^^ch T^easure showen,
And made what was exotic now our own.
What thanks? What praise? o^e we (...) Love so great?
What cost can recompense your pains and sweat?
But yet go on; don't Virtues Race decline;
Finish in spite of B^hman's foes, and thine
What yet remains of his choice works, that they
By thee t^anslated speak our Language may.
If we reward you not, as is your due,
A better hand shall give a Crown to you:
Not Palms, nor Laurels, but of more renown
Of Light Aeternal Christ will give a Crown.
Pium est agnoscere per quem profecisti.

INVOCATIO.
KIng and Creator of all Worlds that be!
Who wast from, and art to Aeternity,
I humbly beg; that with thy Spirit Divine,
Thou would wrap up this grovling Muse of mine,
Beyond the limits of an Earthly strain,
Beyond the dictates of my weaker brain,
Beyond my poor Conceptions; that she may
Sing, quickened by t^y own diviner Ray.
Vouchsafe to grant, O Sempeternal King I
Whilst I thy self, and thy great Wonders sing,
A Beam of Light unto my Pen: Inspire
Me with the Heats of the Seraphic Quire,
That Cherub-like, with everlasting Lays
Thy Wonders sing, and Carol forth thy Praise
I cheerly may: Help then! without thy aid
O Lord! my words are wind, my Numbers fade
Shall, sooner than the Morning dew before
The scorching Sun, which gone, is seen no more.
Be thou propitious Lord! for unto thee
My self and Numbers dedicated be.
INVITATIO.
DRaw near you humble ones, and truly wise,
Cast on this Figure your enlightened eyes,
Where every World does its Arcana's show:
Unless gross darkness shall encompass you;
Without explaining here you may behold
The sacred Secrets that the Worlds enfold;
But if that holy Ray of Light you want,
You may in darkness sit, and ignorant,
Despise the Knowledge of the Truth divine.
Rich Pearls unfitting for the snouts of swine
Are, and unless God with a powerful Gale
Of Love, shall draw aside the obscuring Vail,
Their puzling brains dulled with the Earth below,
May still ignore those things we plainly show.
But you whose hearts concentred are in Love,
Whose eyes withdrawn from Earth, are fixed above,
Whose minds placed on Celestial Objects, free
From mortal cares, and carnal pleasures be;
And you who rancour have dis^el'd your breasts,
Who shun all fruitless, and most vain Contests
I here invite: accept my homely fare,
And freely grant your pardon where I err:
I look for kindness from the learned, and wise,
But scorn from those that Carp, and Criticize.
The Hierogl^phick see: my Muse alone
Travels in Numbers for to make it known.
PROAEMIUM.
ISing no Hero's douty gests in wars,
(...)
With glozing praises: Nor unto the Skies
Advance some common Justice in a King,
Nor the dread fury of the Wars I sing:
Nor with bewitching Lays (...)
The Sacred, the base toys of wanton Love.
Nor praise the Courtly beauties of the times,
With Wine-inspired, and lascivious Rhithmes.
With M^rs or Ven^s does my Muse co^^oyn^
(...)
I Sing (filled with E^bean ^age) the way
To Heaven above, and everlasting Joy;
The vanity of cursed Earth beneath,
Where we poor helpless Mortals live and breath;
The Eternal horrors of the larger Sphere,
Where great Beelzebub and his Princes are:
The constant Joys, and everlasting Bliss
Of the light World; or blessed Paradise:
The holy Myst'ries of the Worlds above
The lasting pleasures of the Spears of Love:
These are the holy subjects of my Song;
Which does the quavers of a sweeter Tongue
Then mine deserve: But yet accept my Will,
Which better would; had I had better Skill.
The Hieroglyphical FIGURE Of the WORLDS.

THE EXPLANATION OF AN Hieroglyphical Figure, SHOWING THE MYSTERIES OF THE
External, Internal and Eternal WORLDS.
The first Part.
SAd and deplorable's the state of man,
Whose day's a vapor, and whose life's a span;
Whose years a bubble, and whose bliss is pain,
Whose joys are trouble, and whose hopes are vain,
Should there indeed no other Worlds but this
Terrestrial be, in which he dwelling is.
Vain were the hopes of just and righteous men,
Than they none were more miserable then;
For who indeed more miserable seem,
More wretched and despised, forlorn then them:
Earth's fat, and bounty often is withheld,
Often they are denied the riches of the field:
A life here poor, and needy often they have,
And often return a^flicted to the grave:
Whilst the unjust, and wicked man the while
Flows with his Honey, Butter, Milk and Oil,
Whilst that his Wine Press gusheth forth a stream
Of purple juice to feed, and fatten him:
Whilst bounteous earth does plenty him afford;
Whilst filled with pleasures, both of bed and board,
Unpunisht, he afflicts the just, and poor,
And empty turns the beggar from his door,
Grindeth the face of needy men: Commits
Murders and Whoredoms, yet triumphing sits
Till he returns to the greedy grave,
And yet is seen no punishment to have.
Sure this most plainly other Worlds does show
To be, where each of these shall have his due,
God's always equal, ever just we see
His acts in number, weight and measure be.
Dives in plenty, Lazarus in pain,
(Yet God is just) shall in this world remain:
A world of pain there for the rich man is,
For Lazarus another full of bliss.
Let Atheists scoff, and seeing these things, declare
Profanely that no other worlds there are:
Let them cry pish, and mock them to their face,
Who threat them judgment in another place:
Let them accursed cry; May we live but here
In pleasures; God nor your vain Hell we fear:
See we not all men to the grave return,
Their dusty ashes gathered in their urn,
Their flesh consume, their harder bones to rot,
Their fames and names both perished and forgot,
Who like the beasts unto the earth do go,
Their souls int' air dissolved, are seen no more:
Deceit the mother of this folly is,
To think there is any other world but this,
For Sophisters to tie men to their Law,
Them with Religion, and a God did aw,
And with invented worlds hereafter; where
They answer should for what they had done here:
Where good and just men should in pleasures dwell,
The wicked be perplexed with torments fell.
Let Atheists argue thus; Let them alone,
For at the last the worst will be their own,
When to their sorrow, and eternal pain
They find the notion of a God's not vain,
When they shall find, when they this world forego,
Another world of torment, pain and woe:
I mean not therefore with them to dispute,
Nor strive with arguments for to confute
Their cursed Tenants; for the stourest does
Often times when scared; in's heart misdoubt the truth
Of what he holds; who by his conscience awed,
Is forced to confess there is a God.
Who boldly dares deny the same in light,
The same again does doubt, the same at night, M^ntiuntur qui dicunt se non
sentire esse Dium, nam etse tibi affirmant interdiu, noctu tamen and sibi
dubitant. Sen.

When fearful darkness reigns over the world,
And fear and horror in each corner's hurld.
When dreadful lightnings through the world do fly
When roaring thunders rattle in the sky,
When blustering storms do rend the stoutest oaks,
When mighty mountains rend with thunder strokes,
When the great Moles of the earth does quake,
When roaring seas with dreadful murmurs speak
The Almighty's power; the Atheist struck with fear,
Crying aloud for help, runs here and there,
And will he, nill he, then his thoughts do fly
For hepl to, and think there is a Deity;
Like that poor Godling who ran under board, Claudius.

And cried, I am no God, when thunders roared.
^f then these wretches doubtful are sometimes,
^o obstinate me thinks they in their crimes
Should not be: for it that it doubtful were,
This way more safe, than that it is to err;
For to believe there is a God, and him
To fear, no damagement can bring to them,
No hurt at all; when on the other side
They'n dangerous seas of Death eternal ride;
For if a God there be (as we well know
There is) into damnation's pit they throw
Themselves: so whilst their wisdom they would express;
They damn themselves by their own foolishness.
But, that there is a God we need not prove,
When all things show his matchless Power, and Love;
For wheresoever we shall cast our eye,
Sure tokens of a mighty God we spy:
The glorious Splendour of the Lamp of Day,
The Mistress of the Night's resplendant Ray.
The silver Spangles of the azure Sky,
The winged folk which in the air do fly,
The spangle-coated fishes of the Sea,
The Brutes, the herbs, the flowr'rs, and every tree,
Do daily tell us, that they being had,
And life, and growth, from an immortal God:
For who but diligently notes them,
Must needs (as GALEN did) confess the same.
The form, and being of this world does prove,
The mighty power of the great IEHOVE,
And that a Deity there is: For why
It Is plain it was not from Aeternity,
The constant changes of all things below,
The same to wise men do most clearly show;
Its alteration, its Catastrophe
Declares; but what is from Aeternity
No end can have. The world beginning had,
Which was from Chance, from Nature, or from God:
From CHANCE it was not; what a jumbled thing,
And foul misshapen Monster Chance would bring
Forth, could but she a world produce? but this
Of harmony and true agreement is
So full that Atheists convinced proclaimed
Have, that not chance but God the world has framed.
For who considers but the Harmony
Of those bright fires shining in the sky,
The order, marriage, and the sweet consent
With one another of each Element:
The secret virtues of all things that grow,
The hidden Sympathy of things below,
And Earth's most admirable form; will not
Himself exhibit to be such a sot,
Nor will be filled with so much ignorance,
As to averr the world was made by CHANCE.
Nor yet by NATURE was the world created,
For if that she had thus the world instated,
All things obedient would have been to her,
And past her bounds, and rules not dared to stir,
But all do know how that sometimes the Creature,
Passes the limits, and the bounds of Nature
Miraculously, as when the golden Sun
Ecclipsed is, in the full of the Moon:
As when the Sun; when Christ our Savior died;
His face did in a Mask of darkness hide,
As all the world well knew; for then between
The Moon and him full half the Heaven was seen:
So that it was impossible the cause
Of this Eclipse should come from Nature's Laws,
Nor yet can those who Nature God will make
For every thing a Natural reason speak:
NATURE nor CHANCE therefore this world could frame,
A God therefore it follows made the same:
A GOD therefore there is: The Devil too,
And acts of evil spirits plainly show
The same; the world can testify to this
That Spirits apparitions no fable is.
But chiefly men (although they God deny)
Themselves are forced a God to justify:
How else can they such an Idea frame
Of the great God, as to deny the same?
For who can an Idea frame of what
No being has? whose species is not?
We an Idea frame may of a face
Of man, or beast, which living never was;
But men, and beasts there are, or else we frame
Could not any Idea's of the same:
So man may false Ideas frame of God,
But were there none, he no Ideas sho^'d;
So man of God does an Idea frame,
Whilst he about goes to deny the same,
And so is forced indeed for to confess
What Is mouth denies with so much wickedness.
Nature has with an Adamantine pen
Insculped deeply into the hearts of men,
That there is a God: although she could not show,
Nor dictate to them the true God to know:
And on their consciences she by her Law
Has of a Deity imposed an aw:
For there is no Nation, though they brutish be,
But have a Notion of a Deity;
Some thing or other for a God adore
They do; which certainly was past the power
Of humane policy for to imprint,
And over the whole world, through all ages hint.
Conscience does prove a Deity likewise,
Which in the face still of the wicked ^^es,
And though his actions never so secret be,
Yet he is afraid there is an eye does see;
An eye which points, and does distinguish still,
Betwixt (the several acts of) good and ill.
Lastly the soul of man, which shall for aye
In night Eternal, or eternal day
Dwell; which immortal is, (for were it not so,
Corruption would take hold upon it too
As well as on its case: but all know this,
The immortal soul in age the stronger is;
The nearer that the body's to the grave,
The more advantages the soul will have:
And so diseases which the case control,
Cannot corrupt, nor yet infect the soul.
S^ always mark whilst from the Body we
By contemplation on deep abstracted be,
The ^oal does better show her complement;
But much more when she is from the body rent:
As also by her la^ge capacity,
And by her utter independency
On the outer case: for leaving that sometimes,
Without that she transcurs the earthly climes,
And visits places; and them far more clear
Beholds than if she in the body were:
This history will justify, but we
Will strive for to avoid prolixity.
If the soul's mortal, what does make her love
(...) despising mortal things to sore above,
And never tire? like unto like does go:
Which makes her thus despise all things below:
And to the Center, out of which she came,
S^ll upwards tend with an immortal flame.)
I say the soul does prove a God to be
The cause of her: or else it follows she
I^ of her self the cause; then should we know
All things that are more clearly than we do;
Knowledge nor understanding should we want,
Nor of our selves, nor parts be ignorant,
Of which we are; our parent then should not
Be ignorant of what they have begot:
But how the cause and the effect can be
All one, as yet I have not eyes to see.
But to conclude what further proof indeed
Of God, than his great Providence does need?
His providence in every thing? but yet
In plaguing those who him denied, and it
Especially? for such struck with his rod,
Have by their deaths made known there is a God.
PHERECIDES was eaten up with lice;
LUCIAN by's dogs devoured in a trice:
DIAGORUS from ATHENS banished,
A talent promised them who brought his head:
An arrow split the heart of JULIAN:
An ulcer killed scoffing APPION:
MACHIAVEL in prison rotted: and
HERMANUS felt the fire, and God's just hand:
^t would be endless to recount them all:
^ut as they did may every ATHEIST fall!
Seeing that there a God immortal is,
(...) follows then there are more Worlds than this;
For God's not seen here in this Orb below,
But as he does himself in's Creatures show:
Indeed he dwells here, and every where,
Nor can he be confined to a Sphere,
But yet there is a world, a glorious place,
Where brightned souls behold him face to face, 1 Cor. 13 12.

Where he is seen clothed with Eternal Day,
Where vails and shadows all are taken away:
Where Saints behold him in great glory stand,
Not veiled as here, nor at the second hand.
Who so believes the sacred Scripture, must
Acknowledge needs that our assertion's just,
For that to take all scruples from us says,
God not one World, Heb. 11. 3.
but Worlds created has.
I Will here not usher in with museful strains,
The exuberant fancies of some witty brains,
Who make the Moon a World to be, and who
Make Worlds of all the stars of Heaven too:
Let such themselves and others to delude
With brain-built worlds, and worlds infinitude,
I Will not contest; GOD may do what he please;
But here I treat not of such Worlds as these,
For I confess I do believe there is four,
And never was, and never shall be more:
Three of these Worlds are infinite, but this
Gross World both visible, and finite is.
It matters not unto Salvation,
Whether there be a thousand Worlds, or one,
Such Worlds as this I mean: but it is meet
That we should know those Worlds of which I treat,
For to be ignorant of these, is to
Ignore the blisses that we ought to know:
How vain is Man for fancied worlds to hunt,
And of himself be wholly ignorant!
These Worlds of which we treat no fancies be,
For to deny them is plain Blasphemy,
And of them to be ignorant, no less
Then to be ignorant of Happiness:
These Worlds not disputable are, for we
Do by experience know such Worlds there be:
Therefore no longer will I prologize,
But clearly set them forth before your eyes*
Pray cast your eye upon the Figure, and
The order see in which the Worlds do stand:
See here four Globes, So stand the Worlds, but yet
Not in this order, as you see these set:
But to man's sense these figures do I guess,
Their place and order best of all express.
Though once be higher than another placed,
We call that highest, which is inner most:
Who can at one expose to perfect view
Whole and complete, Shell, Skin, and Kernel too?
As in an Egg you see the outer shell,
In that the white, in the white the yolk does dwell:
As in an Onion first the outer skin,
Then several others folded are within
Its strict enfolding, which do press upon
The heart, or center of the Onion,
As several Circles one within another
Drawn, some are farther, some more near than the other
Unto the Center: So these Worlds display
Unto your understandings best you may.
So are they placed: The Center of them all
We highest; the Circumference lowest call:
So see in Man his outward case does hide
A noble Soul; Which does more inward bide.
This outward World is as the crust, or shell,
In which the other Light, and Dark Wo^lds dwell.
This outward World, is the Circumference,
And farthest from the Center; Life from whence
It does receive: for from the inward this
Produced was Most plain, the punction is
Before the circle; and the Yolke before
The white or shell. But then you^l say this more
Contains than those Worlds that brought it forth;
So this is greater than what gave it birth:
Those suffer no dimention can, nor lie
So comprehended: As the Sun the Sky
Contains you see; his rays and influence
Howbe't no bounds can close, they are so immense.
As God's in heaven we say; yet every where;
So the inward worlds in this world closed are:
Life flows to the finger from the heart:
Man's soul's in man, and yet in every part.
Alas* How blinded are the souls of men,
Whilst here enclosed in their fleshly pen,
Whilst here in prison fettered fast they lie,
Whilst they all things judge by their outward eye,
They see this earth wherein they live, and so
That there is an earthly world they surely know:
Now other worlds some do believe there are,
The natures of these worlds, or how, or where
They be, most men ignore: for of the same,
They several fancies in their heads do frame.
For speak of heaven, strait way they cast their eyes
Toward the blew seas of the Crystal skies,
Beyond the same a most Majestic Court,
Whose bliss does pass the bounds of all report,
Where all the Saints in brightness like the Sun,
Seated on Thrones; where every one a Crown
Possessing, praise, and Hallelujahs sing,
To God who there sits on the Throne as King,
They think there is; and that their souls must fly
Through the Welkin to it when they dye.
But speak of Hell, strait way their thoughts do go
Unto the Center of the earth below,
Where they in their imaginations frame,
A Realm of Sulphur, Darkness, Fume and Flame,
Where great BEELZEBUB as a King commands
The smooky Devils* and sulphurian bands.
Mistake me not, I do not here deny,
Nor Hell's, nor Heavens true locality;
But here in reference to those I speak,
Who carnally both hell and heaven do seek,
And who know nothing, nor of Heaven nor Hell,
But by report, as they hear others tell;
Accounting it impossible to know,
Or Hell, or Heaven, while they dwell below*
Such of themselves be wholly ignorant,
And the true sight of Hell or Heaven they want;
How they two several Principles be, and
How different, they do not understand:
How they in one another dwell, and yet
A gulf eternal how betwixt them set.
Tho Summit of their knowledge is to know
The nature of terrestrial things below,
They are content, the other worlds should rest
Till they of this by death are dispossessed;
But all such may miss of the blessed sphere,
Who know it not, nor be assured often here.
Therefore we first will with this world begin,
Best known to man, this which he dwells in:
From whence we step by step, at last ascend,
Shall, to the Eternal world, the farthest end;
Man must from this the lowest world get up
By the Internal worlds, unto the top
And summit of his joys: the way shall be
Shown in this book with perspicuity.
But man a while my purpose here supplants,
The chiefest of the earths inhabitants;
Of whom a word, for he is the principal,
And should be Prince, and King, and Lord of all.
The Microcosm, little world, or Man,
Contains all the outward great world can;
Is it not strange, and wonderful that such
A little thing as Man, should hold so much?
Man is a wonder, and Gods image divine,
(If truly Man) within his breast does shine.
It is not head, arms, body, members fair,
That makes Man; he rather may compare
Himself unto some beast in painted dress,
Except the inward do him Man express.
What difference is there 'twixt a man and beast,
(None sure at all, or little to be guest)
If It wan't for Reason, and an immortal spark,
Which hides it self within his hollow Ark?
This makes him Man, and like a man to act,
Which gone, he is like a beast in show and fact.
A man has sense, he eats, he drinks, he sleeps,
Wallows in pleasure, seldom measure keeps,
Subject to hunger, thirst, to heat, and cold,
Sickness, Diseases, and converts to th'Mould
Of which he is framed; and like to other creatures,
There perishes his beauteous forms, and features:
All this the Beast does; then we thus may say
The fairest Beast is made upright of clay.
Men that we see within the great Creation,
Lie wallowing in all abomination,
In filthy Lusts, contagious pleasures foul,
As if they never, never had a soul,
Are not such Beasts? yea perfect Beasts, or worse,
For Beasts (most commonly) follow natures course,
Their beastial actions, acting in sobriety,
When men fulfill their Lusts in all Impiety,
Acting most beastly in all foul inormity,
And worser then the brutes, in their deformity:
That were it not for this their outward The flesh.
case
In PLUTO'S Court they would usurp a place;
For when the outward body does consume,
In Hell such take their Hell-prepared room,
Their souls there having some such shape, or hue
Of beasts, whose actions they inclined to,
Assuming there some hideous form, or feature,
Rarely resembling their deformed Nature.
Thus may you see within this outward place,
We Are either Men, or Beasts: when here our race
Is run, we shall to the Tartarean den
Go if we beasts are, but to Heaven if Men.
Man was a Man created, and a King,
And Lord, and Ruler over every thing,
But now that state h'as lost, for which he groans,
Having gained dunghils,, for his Crowns, and Thrones.
Now of a King he is a servant made,
Who once immortal, now to Death betrayed:
Therefore behold him pourtrai'd to thine eye,
See where himself, his Crown and Scepter lie,
The Lamb the Type of Innocence too,
(Which LUCIFER with ADAM overthrew)
Under the great and massy Globe of Earth,
As if deprived both of Life, and breath.
This is the fallen state of Man, who must
His Crown not unregarded in the Dust
Permit to lie, but, what sum ever it cost,
Strive for to gain the Scepter that he lost;
And tho he now lies slain deprived of all,
Crushed with the weight of this terrestrial ball;
Yet shall this fallen Man at last arise,
And over his now lost Kingdoms Regalize.
O man with joy expect this blisseful day,
Rouse up thy self, enquicken'd with the ray
Of life divine: Shake off this clogging Earth,
And strongly press after another birth:
For that attained once, thou shall be then,
As once thou wast, a Lord, and King again.
In the Hieroglyphic see the lowest Globe,
Which represents this vast terrestrial Orb,
This World wherein we Live, this outward Earth,
Where we poor mortals draw a fading breath,
Where Souls immortal in a mortal case,
As in an Ergastule remain a space:
Which World's a mighty Prodigy; and those
Who it consider, in its Mazes lose
Themselves; for every thing perspicuously
The power shows of Heavens High Majesty.
How admirable is her Form, and Nature!
How beautiful, and well composed each Creature!
How full of beauty, and of Loveliness!
How sweetly, brave is she in Nature's dress!
So that the eyes of man do dote upon her,
And Highest Trophies raise unto her honor.
How various and delightful are her climes!
Some smiling later, some bedress'd betimes;
Some wearing all the year a liv'ry green,
Some diversely with painted mantles seen,
While others dressed in mantles made of snows,
Themselves (as'twere) in silver garbs expose.
How variously delightful dressed is
Each clime, and Country with a native bliss!
How variously through every Region are
Her happy riches, and her costly ware,
Her helps and her commodities for Man,
Her treasures, and her pleasures too, which can
Delight her heart; spread by a bountio^s hand,
And all exposed unto his command.
Aspiring mountains here their heads do show,
Their pleasant dales, empal'd with woods below:
Here the row the midst of them, the silver streams
Run trickling over the stony pearly gems:
Here pleasant Hills adorned with lofty pines,
With Oaks and Cedars; there the Elms and Vines
Sweetly embracing all the Hillocks side
Toward the East, fill with their branches wide.
Here stand the Laurels, with a verdant hue,
Here spreading Beaches, lofty Ashes too;
There by the Brooks grow brittle alder stems,
Willows and Sallows love the silver streams.
A thousand other trees here make a Grove,
Where the sad Tuttle murmuring wooes his love,
Where the sweet Nightingalls compose their lays,
Where other Songsters sing on several sptayes.
Praising their great Creator with their Notes.
Proceeding from their pretty warbling throtes.
Hard by are Meads in ammelled with flowers,
Covered with grass sprung from Zephyrian showers,
Where seems to be an everlasting spring,
Where Grasshoppers in their shrill notes do sing;
Where feed the branched stag, the fair horned Ox,
The clambring Goats, the silver fleeced flocks,
The fair spread Mare, and the courageous horse,
Who kicks the rocks down with his heel's strong force.
Among the woods the several beasts of prey,
The roaring hests of their strong Prince obey:
The fowl Jove's mighty Bird does rule: Within
The Crystal river several fishes swim,
And all these for the use of man were made
Good; who often times converts them into bad.
About the Earth the liquid Ocean beats,
Scareing his sister with his boistrous Threats,
Athough she knows JEHOVAHS word is gone,
That she shall never drowned be ag'en,
Within whose liquid depths such wonders are,
As with the Earths or heavens may compare.
But round this Globe, with a vast azure bent,
Is bended round the starry Firmament,
Wherein the twinkling Lamps beday the nights,
Where are fixed, wandering, less and bigger lights:
There Cyath^a rules Mistress of the night,
With the clear splendour of her borrowed light;
The Sun day's King, and Lord of all the rest,
The clearest, hottest, brightest, and the best,
B^gilds the day, and with a glorious splendour
His daily service does to mortals tender.
Thus has the great Creator full of Love,
His wondrous blessings poured from above
Upon this world; that on this earthly stage,
Man comfort take might in this pilgrimage,
And not abuse them as most men have done,
And souls and bodies by them overthrown.
But if that now such outward bliss remains
After the change of Adams faulty stains,
What was the beauty and the comeliness,
The splendour and incomparable dress
The Earth had when she from her Maker first
Came? e're that she was by his mouth accursed?
E're that she had put on inglorious weeds?
And cherished accursed and banefull seeds?
Should I lanch out into this endless main,
My shallow Barque could n're return again;
Such seas of water, and of wonder too
Appear, and show themselves unto my view:
My eyes no objects on this earth do meet,
But they my globes do with their wonders greet,
For not the smallest fly, nor creeping Ant,
Do wonders, and what is admirable want:
So that I am amazed, and must cry,
Great is the power of his Majesty!
Great are the wonders that this Globe does hold,
So great that they are not able to be told,
Therefore expect not at my hands, that I
Should open here Dame natures Mystery;
Or that the nature of all things below
I here should in this Epique Poem show;
Or that I here the mighty wonders tell,
That in this Orb terrestrial do dwell:
This were an endless task; would Ages tire,
Not Books of Worlds, but Worlds of Books require.
This would: for not the heat-born gnat, (in truth)
Or worm, but often deserve a Poem does.
A glorious study it is to study Nature,
To read the great JEHOVAH in the Creature,
To meditate his mighty wonders here,
And Trophies to his Name thereby to rear:
The great Creator made all things that be,
For profit, pleasure, and commodity
Of man alone, therefore His holy Name
He ought to praise, and thank him for the same.
Let some therefore dive to Earth's Center, and
The secrets of her bowels understand,
Let them her seal'd-up doors unbarr, and there
Her rusty Treasures brighten, and reclear:
Let such dive down into her depths below,
And the Arcana's of her Min'rals know;
Let them the row every Room, and Chamber run,
And know the virtues of her central Sun,
Which with its Heat, pierceing the row every room,
Gives life to seeds, sown in her vaster womb.
Let such behold her hidden Palaces,
Where sealed up lie hid her Mysteries,
There let them Tin, Ir'n, or pine, Stibium, Brass,
Virmilion, Merc'ry, Lead, and Coperasse,
Copper, Letrargyre, Marble, Salt, and Iet,
View; and let them break up her Cabinet,
Where they with curious prying eyes, behold
May all her Mines of Silver, Steel, and Gold,
Her choice of Rubies, Saphires, Calcedones,
Her Topaz, Opals, Emeraulds, Diamond's,
Her Carbuncles, her Amythists, her store
Of Turques, Crystals, and a thousand more:
Let them the virtues of the Lodestone see,
And all the Earths that Medcinable be:
Let them their secrets daily meditate,
Through them God's name, and wonders predicate.
Let others on her superficies walk,
And through all her vegitables stalk:
Into Earths dainty garden-plats let them
Come and search out the virtues of each stem;
Let them the secrets of all simples know,
The virtues of all herbs, and flowers that grow:
Let them consider flowers fragrancies,
Their checquer work^, and dainty diapres,
The Violets, the Roses and the Lilies;
The Pansies, Marigolds, and Daffodillies;
The admired Lotos: secret virtues given
To herbs and shrubs by the free hand of heaven.
Let Mugwort, Saffron, Burnet, Piony*
Swines-bread, St. John's Wort, and Succory,
Madder, Angelica, and Bittany,
Lunaria, Hellebore, and Dittany,
With thousands more, whose virtues wonderf^l
Men into admiration justly pul^,
Considered be: Then that which makes us bread,
And grain of all sorts be considered.
Then let them walk unto the spacious groves,
And see the Male-Palms, woo their female Loves,
View there the Peruanan Brasil, how
It peopled does like to a Village show:
See there the Oak, the Maple, Ash and Vine,
The Elm, the Larch, the Cedar and the Pine,
The Indian Cocos, which supplies the lack
Alone both of the belly and the back,
The Corck, the Osier, Alder, Willow, Holm,
The Poplars, Beaches, Yews against a storm
Good for a shelter; and consider these,
The Natures and the Uses of the trees.
Then to the fragrant Orchards go, and there,
The Apple, Plum, the Cherry and the Pear,
The Apricock, the Oring, Quince and Beach,
The Limon, Feald-beard, Walnut that does reach
It Is head to Heaven almost, the Olive, Date,
The Baulm, and Spice-trees, which are good to eat,
See (and admire the Hand of Providence)
Their Wonders, virtues, and their excellence.
Let others also view Earth's numerous guests,
And daily weigh the natures of the Beasts,
The Mysteries of Animals they may
And their hid virtues to the World display.
Let them traverse the Hercanian Woods, and there
The shaggy Lion, and the cruel Bear,
The Elephant, Rinocerot, the Bore,
The Camel, Bull, Horse, Ass, a thousand more
Behold: and in black Chus his scorched plains
Draw out the Serpents from the sandy draines:
Consider there the Basilisk they may,
Who through his eyes his poison does conveigh,
The scaly Dragon, spiteful Viper, the
Aspick, and Adder, and Tarantule,
Which pu^s the stung into a Capering fit;
Then call for Music that is the cure of it:
D^ynas, and Dispas, Scorpion, and Eft
Who tho but small, to kill can make a shift:
The Horned Cerastes, and the Crocadile
Who daily stuffs his mighty paunch in Nile.
And let them the Cam^lions various hue,
With worms, and flies, Bees, other insects too
Consider well, and let them then proclaim
The virtues, and the Wonders of the same.
Again let others with industr'ous bent,
View, and review the other Element:
Peer into Rocks, and on the Mountains Top,
See mighty Rivers infant springs burst up:
And let them weigh (while others range the Woods)
The several virtues of the Crystal floods.
Let some behold the Cateracts of Nile,
Others the source of Tanais the while,
Some rapid Tigris, others Euphrates,
Ganges, and Plate, great Rivers rather Seas.
Tagus, and Rhyne, and Rhone, and Tiber too,
Arn, S^in, and Po, Ister, and (...) view,
Our silver ^^is, which upon the main
(...) born, smells, purges, and grows sweet again.
The Effects and Operations then Recount
Of the day cold, and the Night-scalding fount:
Of Athamas whose cold, and Crystal Flood,
Gives living flames unto the drenched Wood.
Or Silarus, or the Ciconian streams
That wood convert to solid stone it seems.
Or the Arcadian Well, of which who drinks,
All other waters, yea wine loathsome thinks,
Also Lincestus who drink much of it,
Do reel like Drunkards in a drunken fit.
A thousand more scarce credible: and then
The medicinable waters good for men:
The Bathes of Bathe; Bangers in Gascony,
And Bajae famous once in Italy.
Then to their Fish-boat, with their tackle try
To draw from Brooks the Silver-coated fry,
The speckled Trour, the Barbel, Tench, and Ele,
The dainty Salmon, Cherin, Lampry, Seile,
And any more: Then hoist into the Seas,
Where great variety their minds may please;
Where they as many several wonders view
May, as in the Earth, and airy Regions too.
The Row NEPTUNE'S wa^'ry Regions let them go,
To THETIS Coral-garnish'd Court below.
There let them view the shrubs, the Trees, the Pearls,
The Sirens, Mearmaids, Tritons with their shells,
And all the Fishes that do daily sport
Themselves within great NEPTUNE'S liquid Court.
There they may Philanthropic Dolphins see,
The Whirle-Pool Whales, the terror of the Sea
Leviathans; the Sturgions, Amia's,
The Cuttles, Tunnys, Prawnes, and Remora's,
The Pearl-Fish, Oysters, Sargus, Cantharus,
The Mullet, Herring, Uranoscopus:
With many more, which in that Region swarm,
Of sund'ry sizes, qualities, and Form.
There they the qualities of the Sea to know
May strive; how it does daily ebb, and flow,
Its virtues, properties, how like a Lover
The Earth embraces, and yet flows not over:
And seeing these A^cana's of the flood;
May preach the wonders, praise the Name of God.
Also let others winged the row the air,
Propitiously their noble courses steer,
And let their constant minds be daily bent,
Upon the wonders of that Element:
There they may ransack every cave and house,
That does belong to boistrous Aeolus.
The several Regions of the air they may,
With Hails, and Snows, and Rains, and Frosts display,
With Dews and Comets, Exhalations, Thunder,
Mists, Blasts and F^mes, and Lightnings full of wonder.
They too consider may when they are there
The winged people of the moving air:
Up to the Eagles Eyrie may they run,
And see the Eaglets face, the dazzling Sun,
Scorning to wink, for by this certain sign,
Fowls Prince knows that her brood is genuine.
Thence to the Arabian spicy woods they have
May, and behold the Phaenix in her nest,
The Whilst her spicy bed begins to burn,
And her consumes in her fragrant urn;
Straight way the ashes in her dainty Tomb
Take life, and so the grave becomes the womb
Of a new Phaenix, from whose ashes rise
Another Phaenix shall when e're she dies.
The unkind Estridge on the Arabian plain,
Beating her plumes against the wind in vain,
Who cannot mount as other fowl, that fly
Within the liquid bosom of the sky;
Behold; and see Queen Juno's stately Bird,
Her train extending high at every gird:
The brustling Turkey, and the crested Cock,
The Huswife's watch, the sturdy Plow-mans clock.
Then see the Crane, the Stork, the Pelican,
The Cormorant, the Hern, and silver Swan,
The Halcyon, the bird of Paradise,
That never touches ground until she dies,
The Griffin, Faulcon, Laner, Marlin, Kite,
The Swift, and Swallow that renews the sight
Of her blind yo^ng with Selandine: the Pie,
The Lark and Finch, and many more that fly
Within the Air's fair region: Here they may
The secret virtues of them all display.
And seeing here the wonders of the Lord,
His Name and Praises trumpet may abroad.
Lastly, le^ others free from earthly cares,
God b'ye bid to the earth, and view the stars.
Where with fair pinions fluttering along,
The Azure dwelling of that numerous throng,
They may behold the Roods, and several Inns,
Of the sev'n Planets, and the twice six signs.
There they the Coach may of the day's bright Prince
Follow, and view's course, and circumference;
His flaming and swift steeds quotidian rac^,
His twelve fair lodgings in his annual space:
How he the seasons of the year creates,
How now the days length, now the nights length bateth.
There they fair PHEBE, horned now, ever long
Filling her Orb with light grow fair, and young
Again, may see; her diverse aspects, and How when at full eclipsed understand:
How nimbly tripping in a swift carere,
The heavenly Zodiac twelve times in a year
She passes. Thence to Mercuries sphere they go
May, and behold his annual motion too,
Who waiting on the Chariot of the Sun,
Spends almost twelve-moneths ever his race is run.
Thence mounting higher they behold the fair,
And splendid Veaus, now the evening star,
Someti^^s again, with most resplendant rays,
And matchless beauty sh' ushers in the days.
Thence still ascending viewing Phoebus sphere,
They may behold him measure out the year;
And how he does years several seasons cause,
Spring at's approach, Winter when back he draws;
Summer and Autumn, when his jorneys made
The Row Cancer, and when with the Virgin laid.
Thence to the angry God of War they go
May, and behold his sphere, and journey too,
Which ever he't finished the row the Houses has,
Three Summers, and as many Winters pass.
Then to the Sphere of Jupiter they wenn
May, and behold his Chariot of Tinn,
Which twerling the row the Zodiac, does run
Four trines of years ^'r't does to Pisces come.
Thence they to leaden Saturn may advance
Whose coursers slowly thirty years do prance,
Ever they can draw their heavy Car about,
And see the place from whence they first set out.
And thence to the eight Sphere; whose mighty bent
Contains the Host of the blew Firmament,
Whose vaster circuit, ever it turns about
(Tho'swift) almost sev'n thousand years wears out.
Heaven's glittering Zone next then they may behold,
Fringed with Silver, and embos'd with Gold,
Wherein twice six most glorious Figures stand,
Exactly wrought by an Almighty Hand:
March his brave Ram, and Apri^'s Bull that brings
Upon his horns the garland of the springs:
The embracing Twins; The Crab that first does show
Fair Sommer's presence with a swetty brow:
Then rampant Leo, who with burning breath
Scorcheth the Planes, and green Woods withers.
The Virgin next who smiling does appear
To crown the Plow-man's Hopes for all the year.
The Balance then beaming with splendor bright
The aequidistance weighs of Day, and Night.
The Scorpion, C^ntau^e, Kid, and Skinker shine,
The Fishes too, a wet and Winter sign.
Turning their heads then to the Artic pole,
They may behold the m^nstrous Dragon roll,
^ith his starry tail, the Wain man; there
(...) Crown, the Harp, the Eagle, and the Spear
The Snake, the Swan, and flying Pegasus;
And^omeda, and her dear P^rseus,
Casiop^ia, and the Dolphin, and
Medusa's Head, and Cepheus do stand.
Then to the Antartic turn they may, and view
Where the (...) dog star, and Orion too,
The Whale, the Whelpe, the Hare, the Hulke, and the
Raven, Wolf, Fowl, the Boule and Hydra be:
The Crown, the Fish, and other stars beside,
Most plainly by Astronomers descri'd.
There also may they with a mind intense
Consider all the Twincklers influence
On th'Orb below, and how they often change
Men's minds, and manners, in a manner strange.
How pleasant meeting in conjunction smile;
How frowning opposite another while:
Heaven is God's Book, the Stars are letters that
Himself so fair with his own finger wrote;
Wise Men can read them; ignorants indeed
Do 'count them Ciphers, 'cause they cannot read:
Wise Men alone do rule the stars, but they
(...) cause both Man, and Beast their Laws obey:
Who vieweth thus the Arcana's of the Sky,
Glory may give to Heaven's High Majesty,
But let us not unmindful be of Man,
Who harbors Wonders in his outer frame;
Tho Worlds he hold, That to the outer Sphere
Does answer, therefore to be mentioned here.
Let therefore some anatomize him, and
His Body's inner parts well understand.
There let them see the purple springlets draine
From Life's true Center through every vein:
The spungy Lungs, the bellows of the Breast,
The stomach Cook by whom the food is dres't;
The which prepared, by the Misentric's sent
Unto the Liver for its nourishment,
Where, in a short space all the juicy flood
Died, is converted into Crimson blood,
From whence, as Rivers from the Fountains Head's,
It by the veins the row all the Body spreads.
Descending lower let them view at leisure,
The Guts fine labyrinth the Bellie's Treasure.
But ever they thus dissect him, let them see
His comely features, and Limbs symmetry,
See the fair capital of this structure, stand
On a Cylindric pillar to command
The rest: H^s spacious Front the Throne of Aw,
And Maje^^y: His eyes that homage draw
From other creatures, like two Twinklers bright
Sparkling, and streaming with clear Rays of Light,
S^and placed under two fair arc's of Hair;
These with two lidds from harm defended are,
That with a double guard of slender pikes,
Keeps off the offensives that the Eye dislikes.
See then the Conduits of the Head: likewise
Two blushing Mounts that in his Face arise;
The Ruby portals of a pearly gate,
The Mill and grinder of the body's meat.
The Tongue words former, and the maz^y Ear
Through which he does the formed voices hear.
His Hands the body's Purveyors, his Knees,
His Legs, and Feet the Basis unto these;
For ties the sinue, ligaments the Nerve,
And bones for Beams, do in this building serve.
But most of all, who will not admire at
H^s speech, the nimble Tongue's uncessant chat?
Words they are wonders, in the Head created,
Then by the tell-tale Tongue a loud related.
His Wit, and Memory are admirable,
For to recount whose Wonders none are able.
Mechanics, and the Mathamatics too,
And almost all things in the World, do show
The mighty wonders of Man's pregnant Brain:
The Muses, and Apollo's wits it drain
Would, should they go about but to recount
The same: indeed they Number do surmount.
But whosoe'r Contemplates Man, may see
The matchless Wisdom of Heaven's Majesty.
Th^se are the Seas of endless Wonders, where
God's admirable power does appear,
For who-soe'r into these depths does go,
Shall the Creator's Wonders see, and know,
Into which Seas infinitude I fear
So slender' vessel as mine own to steer:
Nor am I suffered now (to swell my verse)
These things (although Arcana's) to rehearse:
Nor yet Geography's fair Lists to enter,
Fair E^ROP'S limits, or great ASIA'S Center,
To speak of, or to tell what bounds do close
Scorched AFRICA, AMERICA, what Seas.
To say what River, Mountain, Lake, or Ground,
Or Seas, do such, and such a Country bound.
To tell each soil's abundant fruitfulness,
Its diverse properties, and various dress:
To say where grows the sweetest Grain, and where
Best wine; what Lands best Hemp, and cordage bear:
What Country Timber, Cattle, Silk, and Lead
Yields; Where most Mines are, where best Horses bred:
The Countries temp'raments; the peoples manners,
Religion, Laws, Rites, Customs, Habits, Honors.
These things I leave to others to rehearse,
They come not here in compass of my Verse,
For should I lanch into so vast a Main,
My slender Barque could never return again;
Although indeed all these be Wonders great,
They are not those of which I mean to treat.
Filled with a fire that now inflames my Soul,
That with strong ardors, in my Breast does roll,
That fill's me with a sacred rage, and bears
Me from the Earthly into mystic Spears,
I write; Know therefore this World twofold is,
Filled with a curse, and yet retains a bliss;
Full of deformity, and ugliness.
Though washed over with an outward dress;
And yet there is a part that does indue,
The Robe of happiness, and beauty too.
In one part stand great BABEL'S lofty Towers,
SODOM'S profane, and AEGYPT'S wicked Bowers,
Where LUCIFER triumphs, and reigns as King,
In's Throne of Evil, and his Court of Sin;
Sorrow, and Care, Labor, and Toil, and Swet,
Trouble, vexation, round about him set.
Here SATURN'S Lord, (though it is by usurpation)
Here he commits spoil, and devastation;
Here his great Princes, with their Hellish art,
His Stygian Vice-Royes, govern each a part,
Who here mal^gning mortals happiness,
Do cause them one another to distress.
Here bloody wars, the stained Campaine spread
With mangled Limbs, and Bodies butchered:
Here is the Crystal, turned to Crimson flood,
Distained with the gore of humane blood:
Here thousand Orphans, thousand Widows stray,
Here thousand Captives chained are led away.
Here Famine rages, here contagions spread,
That scarce the Living can intert the Dead:
Here sicknesses, and all diseases are,
Here miseries, unhappiness, and care.
Here also all the sins in order range,
Provoking all Men ^or to take their swinge:
Here avarice, here cruelty, and here
Lusts, murders, rapines, drunkenness appear,
Here Riot, Luxuries, and wantonness,
Here also pinching, scraping, and excess,
Deceit and cheating have their Residence
Within the vast Realms of this mighty Prince;
Within the circuit of great BABYLON,
Where mighty LUCIFER has pitched his throne:
Where like a Prince (and like a Lion stout
For's prey) he w^lks his Country round about.
In the other part of this great Universe
(Which masked to mortals yet true beauty wears)
JERUSALEM, and blessed S^ON stand,
With famo^s Ed^^, and the Holy Land,
Fair Paradise; felicites blessed site,
Where pleasure, and unwearied delight
Where Plenty, Peace, where Justice, Righteousness,
Where Truth, Love, Piety, and Happiness
Dwell sweetly linked, There still a springing green,
And constant verdure, sans decay is seen.
No Winters blasts, no stormy Rages there,
No wars, nor cruel Discords once appear:
No vices Vipers brood, no blood, nor murder,
No cheats, deceits, no Rapines, nor disorder,
No Lusts, nor avarice, nor base impiety,
No cursing Men, blaspheming of the Deity,
No Oaths, nor Rancor, no injustice, nor
Ambition, Envy; Stimula's to war,
Can there approach: here only dwells community,
Peace, Meekness, Love, Truth, Wisdom, Joy, and Unity.
Here King of this part sacred Jesus sits,
Who to his Viceroys also parts commits,
The holy^ Angels; under whose command
They with impartial Justice rule the Land,
And for the good of mortals still expose,
Their vigor to the Rigor of our Foes,
Our Stygian foes, who, were it not for them,
From the Earth would quickly root the mortal stemm.
All that both good, and blessed does appear,
All that is delightful, or contentful here,
All that is beautiful, or does delight
With hurtlesse pleasures, both our heart, and sight,
Proceeds from the Happy Influence
Of this part of the world: Likewise from thence
Proceeds our health (mortals chief wealth) content,
Bliss, Joy, peace, concord, and true Blandishment.
All that both Evil, and accursed is,
All that is ugly, and all bane to Bliss,
All that is hurtful, poison, sickness, death,
All discords, wars, infections, jarrs beneath,
On the other side comes from the Influence
Of that part, where enthroned sits Hel's black Prince.
Now were That gone, this Earth an Hell would be,
And were not This here we 't an Heaven should see:
So that this Eart'hs a medly, checkered still
With black, and white, composed of Good, and Ill.
The darker part, where Satan rules, does here
Perspicuously to mortal eyes appear
Th'rowout the world; and blessed Paradise
Obscured by clouds, is hid from mortal eyes,
And as it were triumphed upon, and fled
From the Earth, and thence for ever banished.
What said I, hence for ever banished? No,
I must recant, and if I did say so,
For ^illed now with a prophetie Rage,
My Life, and all that is dear to me engage
I dare, I will; that Sathan's tumbling down,
And shall bereft be both of Rule, and Crown.
Ever long; this Earth so long the Stage of Hell,
Love's blessed influence ever long shall feel:
Cher^ Saints, and tremble all you wicked crew,
A Day of bliss, of sorrow, be to you
It shall. Chere Hearts Night's sable blacks are gone,
And fait Aurora now begins to dawn:
Turn to the East your long-expecting eyes,
And see this Sun in his bright luster rise;
His Kingdom then no longer shall be hid,
Nor under clouds of darknesses abide,
None then shall say, where is this Kingdom, where
This Paradise? for then it shall appear
In all its luster the row the Earth, and then
Jesus alone shall reign the King of Men.
Nothing but Peace, and Righteousness shall flow,
With Joy, and Bliss, and all content below:
Then shall IEHOVAH'S gracious will be done
On Earth, as now in Heaven by every one.
For this end was the Earth created: shall
The end not be (for which God made this ball)
Effected then? for hitherto we see,
The Devil King was of this Globe, not he:
But now he shall be King alone, with shame
^ell banished Earth: I A TRUE PROPHET AM.
But now my thinks your words assault mine ear,
Where Is Paradise? desirously you quaere.
In what by-corner of the Earth it stands?
Whether in Peru? or by ^anges sands?
Whether it under the Aatartic lies?
Or where the Riphean snowy Mountains rise?
In what place lies this blessed part, which is
The Realm of Joys, and the state of Bliss?
We know that once (five thousand years ago)
It was where rapid Euphrates does flow:
But where it ever since has hid its head,
Into what Kingdom, or what Country fled
We do not know. I Will tell you then where lies
The happy Regions of blessed Pa^adise.
To find this place, you need not cut the seas,
You need not travel to clear Euphrates;
You need not pass the Arabian sands; nor go
Over the craggy Alps uneven brow:
Nor visit TEMPES fragrant bosom, nor
The Atlantides, nor other Regions; for
Though round the world you go; search every C^eek,
And every Land, and every corner seek
Of this great Universe, your labor lost
May be, and you reap pains for all your cost.
Know then that it in every Land does lie,
But yet the place none but the Wise can 'spy:
Vails double died in pitch are thrown thereon,
And yet it is as naked as the Sun.
The Row out the world it is, and seems to be
Fast linked unto the other part of the
Great World; but yet an endless Gulf remains,
Between this Land of Bliss, and that of stains.
Rivers they are not, that do bound this Land,
Nor massive Mountains, that do justing stand:
Nor Woods, nor Heaths, nor Planes, nor Hills, nor Seas,
Nor Groves, nor Vales, nor Piles, nor Pales, nor Trees
This place from the other part of Earth divide:
Nor yet does it in Caves, or Valleys hide
It self; nor does between the Mountains lie,
Whose craggy tops aspiring touch the sky:
It Is wall is fire, which bounds it round about,
Which keeps the wicked, and unrighteous out:
It Is Ianitor, or Centinal does stand,
Armed with a flaming weapon in his hand;
But (without clouding it) it in a word;
A mighty Cherub only has for guard.
As Day dwells in the shadows of the Night,
As darkness does involve the splendid Light,
As the bright flame lies hidden in the coal,
So lurking lies this holy place in all
The Universe: So lies Jerusalem
And SION clouded are with Babylon,
But yet the Gulf 'twixt them's as great, I say;
As betwixt Light, and Darkness, Night, and Day:
For tho, in one another hid they be,
They yet together cannot stand you see;
For when the Darkness spreads its wings, the Light
Flies: So bright Day does chase away the Night.
When Night comes she involves the shining Day;
When Day comes it hides Night within it is Ray.
Thus dwell the The first Principle. The second Principle.
Principles in one another,
Thus Hell, and Heaven blended are together,
Thus is the Good part of the Earth hid in
The Evil part, the spacious Realm of sin.
Then wonder not if I to you relate
That while you dwell in Babylonish state,
In midst of Babel, and her wickedness,
Priding your self in all her whorish dress,
Your next near neighbor (in the world's account)
May dwell upon thrice sacred SION'S Mount,
And in blessed Paradise: for tho he may
In Night seem, He in Night has found the Day.
He plows, he sows, he reaps the Earth; so you
The Gleab do plow, sow, reap, and husband too,
But yet your aim, and end, and his infers
He is God's Stuart, you are Lucifers:
From several principles you act, and he
Is in the second, in the first you be;
He dwells in EDEN, and JERUSALEM,
But you in Egypt, and in Babylon.
Thrice happy is the Man, that thus has found
In midst of Babel this thrice hallowed ground.
The purest Crystal, nor the whitest snow,
Nor candid'st Lilies, fairest flowers that grow,
Nor splendid Phoebus, nor the nitid air,
Nor shining Phoebe half so bright, nor fair,
Nor half so pure, nor immaculate
Are as the Soul of this great World: yet that
Before Man fell, less pure, and divine
Than Man was, and under his feet did shine.
But since he joined with it, and by it fell,
He gave admittance also unto Hell,
And its Magia to infect it, so
That man by it is often made subject to
Hel's Prince, and Law: for whilst he in this Room
Of flesh remains, he is easily overcome
By the World's spirit: Satan wholly bent
To mischief Man, makes it his instrument,
So that, what is pure of it self ^e still
Distaines, and so converteth Good to Ill.
Heaven also for the good of man does use
The same; for by the same he does diffuse
External blessings, Wisdom, Wit, and Wealth,
Riches, and Honors, Plenty, Pleasures, Health;
But this more plainly shall explained be
Where we speak of the Good, and Evil Tree. See Page

I do admire that man should ignorant
Be of this great World's Soul; so greatly want
The true sight often, being so nearly he
To it is fastened by a Sympathy:
For's outward body comes from that womb,
That very LIMYS, whence this Earth did come:
Being that by the same such strange things brought
May be to pass, such mighty wonders wrought;
Such miracles of Nature shown: For by
The same he may do wonders, Prophecy,
Be by infusion Learned in Tongues, and Arts,
And thousand others which this Sp'rit imparts,
In so much that amazed Man has thought,
The Devil only such great things had wrought.
For not the Devil as most men suppose,
But this world's Seal those Oracles enclose
Did of the Heathen; So the Sybills, So
The D^uids did what came to pass foreknow:
And to those Priests filled with Prophetic rage,
By the same Sp'rit did future things presage.
So famous actions, done by Ganges strand,
The same day known in the Ausonian Land
Were, and might well be, by this Sp'rit made known,
As what on all parts of our body's done
We at the instant know; this world's Soul so
What Is done in any part of the Earth does know,
And so impart the same to Mortals may;
And Wonders, which I mention not, display:
And all this by Man's close conjunction
With this great Spirit (not the Devils)'s done.
Yet I confess that oftentimes the Devil,
That great Imposter, Father of all evil,
Has had his Oracles, and Prophets too,
That he thereby might his dark Magic show,
From whence much ill produced was: So that all
Count him the Father of what is M^gical.
Now to this World's great Spirit there belong
Of Spirits an innumerable throng,
Which only to this outer world pertain,
With it created, and shall dye again
When it is dissolved: These nothin have to do
With those black Spirits that are subject to
Hell's horrid Prince; and different from those
Whom the Prince of the lighter Orb has chose
To be's peculiar servants. These control
Does (being its Instruments) the great World's Soul.
Of these, some in the fiery Element
Inhabit; some within the azure bent
Among the stars: And others daily sport
Within the flameing Rooms of Vulcan's Court:
Such are within Vesuvius's sulp'ry womb,
And great Enseladus's fiery 'tomb:
Such in flame-belching Propochampech sport;
Such cause the noyses in Mount Heclesort;
Where flakes of fire, and black stinking smoke,
The Country round for many Leagues do choke;
Where hammers noise, and Cyclop's strokes like thunder,
Till all that dare, go hear the same with wonder.
Others there be, which do their nests prepare,
Within the ^epid bosom of the Air:
These are swift Curriers who with news can go,
And things transport from Ganges, unto PO:
These are those airy birds that soon can bear, Ecl. 10. 20.

Your whispered Treason unto Cesar's ear,
These, these are those mustered by higher hands,
That in the aire's clear Region show their bands.
Where skirmishing in battel's order, show
Wars future evils, and events to you:
Such Germany, and our dear Albion has
Seen just before dire wars have come to pass*
Some dwell within the caves of Aeolus:
Some likewise dwell in dropping Auster's house:
Some ride upon the back of Taurus; some
From Western Seas with sweet Favoni^^ come:
Some on the wings of blustering Bor^as ride;
And some sweet Zepher's fragrant blasts bestride.
Others love Neptun^'s Courts, and Th^t^'s Lap:
Others themselves in Crystal Rivers wrap,
Such was that Triton, who met Caesar on
The sedg^-fring'd Bank of rapid Rubicon:
And bravely sounding h^s recurved shell
Presaged good Fortune: which to Caesar fell.
Others in Fountains have their habitations;
Others in Lakes, sporting in inundations:
Some love the River, some a stinking Pool.
Some clear-spring'd Iord^n; some Asphales foul;
Some stinking Lakes, which as Maeotis love;
Some likewise never from Avernus move.
So some the lesser Rivers, some the Great
Do choose (some wander) for a constant seat.
Some to the Earth belong, and these abound
In numbers great, or on, or under ground.
The subterran, within their hidden den,
Hide treasures from, sometimes disclose, to Men:
Sometimes such move the Treasures that they hide,
Sometimes by these are Mines, to Men denied.
Sometimes great treasures they disclose; anon
To dirt convert them, or thence steal ag'en.
Others: which on the Earth do dwell, some Love
The Rocks, and Caves, and some the shady Grove;
Some Woods, and Trees: some stones, some fields, some Planes,
Some Vales, some Hills, some Marshes, Meadows, Draines.
Some in Islandian He^la love to lie,
Others in Hechelberg to roar, and cry.
Some one place, some another Love, but all
Are frequent almost throughout all the Ball.
Some love for to converse with men, but some
More solitary rather'd have their Room.
Some also love among the dead to be,
Churchyards and Tombs do best with such agree:
I do not mean those shapes of Men that walk
About Churchyards, or bloody feilds do stalk,
For these are the astral bodies of dead men,
Which to the earthy fain would join again,
But these dissolving, those are forced to die,
And to the Chaos whence they came to fly.
Now some of Spirits.
these have bodies, others none,
Some borrow shapes, some shapes have of their own,
Some are great Lords, and Princes, others are
Servants to them: some peace, and others war
Do cause: some govern Cities, Countries large,
Some have a greater, some a lesser charge.
Some they are often, some they are seldom seen:
Some merely mortal, at a certain time
Die as the Beasts, and to their Ether go;
Some 'bide so long shall as the world shall do;
Who then shall, with the soul of this great world,
Into the womb from whence they came de hurled.
By these Arcanas deep are often made known
To men, and secrets of this world are shown:
Farther they search not, for their skill does lie
In knowing solely this worlds Mystery.
There lies their Essence. But the Devils can
The dark world's secrets and the Outer's scan:
And so the Angels know their own, and this
World; 'cause their Essence in them hidden is.
But man composed of all the worlds may know
The things of this, the light, and dark world too.
A thousand Myst'rys here disclosed might be
Fetched from these knowing spirits treasury;
And would man dive into their depths, he there
Sold find great secrets, and Arcana's rare
Concerning (only) this great world: But I
Do man advise a lof'tier flight to fly,
And not into this out-world's Magic quaere;
For noble Man's not born a subject here,
But this world's spirit to command, and so
Should from a higher Magic all things know.
Magic is threefold: this world's natural,
Sacred the light, dark, diabolical:
Great is the Magic of this world, but yet
Greater the dark, the light more great than it.
When this worlds secrets, Man knows from the light,
He knows the Magic of this wo^ld aright,
But otherwise he deals preposterous,
Lets go a Jewel; does a bauble choose.
As it unlawful is for man, for to
Investigate the dark world's Magic; so
He leave this lower Magic should, and strive
To gain what it through Adam did deprive
Him of; for 'twas the Magic of this orb
Which clothed Adam in his fleshly garb.
Let man therefore wisely investigate
The ancient Glory of his pristi^e state,
And through the Magic of the light worlds see
This world's Arcana's, and grand Mystery.
The Heathen that advantage had not, as
Through mercy now the holy Christian has,
For Christ our Savior has thrown down the Wall
Which wrath erected had through Adams fall,
Which bard us from the secrets of that place,
Illuminated by our Saviors face,
And gives free leave unto the Holy-wise,
Adams lost Magic now to reagnize:
Through which, true-man may able be to know
The internal Worlds, and this worlds secrets too.
This is the true and safest way to see
Into the Magic of this world, and be
Acquainted with all its Arcana's, for
Through ignorance great danger else incur
You may. Satan that great Impostor, that
Does for to mischief Man all times await,
With higher Magic can deceive you soon,
And by the world's sp'rit can procure your ruin.
Since he (through Adams fall) within this Sphere
Has got a place, he does so dominere,
That to his will he bows this Magic, and
Makes this worlds spirits follow his command;
So that all mischief that these Spirits do
The Man, the Devil does enforce them to.
One skilled in the dark-Magic can do more
Then he who is skilled in this World's, but before
Them both is he who in the Light-^o^ld's skilled:
By him the plottings of the Devil's spil'd,
He cannot deceived be, Concerning Magic, see farther page
to his does bow
This World's deep Magic, and the Devil's too.
He then this World's whole Host of Spirits, and
The dark World's too, shall have at his command,
Inferiors bow unto Superiors shall:
This out World's Spirits passive lie to all
Both Dark* and Light Magicians, so that they
Sometime the dark, sometime the Light obey.
Let Christians therefore the true Magic gain,
And nothing hidden from them shall remain:
Then without danger to deceived be
By Hell the myst'ries of this World they will see.
For this end Jesus (at whose mighty Name
All evil spirits bow their Heads for shame,
And fear) beholding Sath^^n's Subtleties,
How he by this World's Spirits, injuries
To Man did do; has them restrained, so
That they appear not as they are wont to do.
To him they bowed, where e're he came their heads,
And ever since where his bright Gospel spreads
They Are not so frequent; for the glorious Rays
Of it, with splendour does them much amaze.
In ^ormer time the Heathen swallowed were
More into the Spirit of this outer Sphere,
Then men are now (and yet more wickedness
Abounds now in the World, I do confess,
Because Hell's Center now is opened more
Within this World, than ever it was before,
Because the wrath of God's more irritated,
Because through Light our sins are aggravated)
Therefore these Spirits were more frequent then:
Appeared to, and conversed more with Men.
Men now more near conjoyn to Hell; therefore
They Men frequent not as they did before:
Not now by Vice-Roy^s, but now Hell commands
In person, and in the^ Hearts Center stands.
The Devil like a subtle Captain deals,
Who from's Foe's actions still advantage steals,
And strives to make his Foe's brave Policies,
Prove helps to him, to himself injuries:
Satan perceiving the high hand of Heaven,
For to restrain the power it had given
To Spirits, and that now they in this Sphere
Did not, as they did formerly appear,
He strait suggests to Man that there are none,
And so to think a vain opinion
Makes him believe it is: Through which sad Evil
He might induced be to believe no Devil,
And so no Hell, nor Heaven; for by this mean
He hopes Atheism to bring in again,
That he Men's souls might get: But who believe
This great Impostor, do themselves deceive.
Laugh not at Fairies, Pigmies, Gnomies, Sylfes,
M^losinae, Sylvestres, Sirens, Elfes,
At Lemures, Neuferan^, Diamae,
At Nymphs, Penates, Durdal^s, Und^nae,
For name them what you will, or as you please
Baptize them, there such Spirits are as these.
As likewise Planetary Spirits, and
Such as do Places, and the Winds command:
With thousand other mundane Spirits, that
God did, when he did this great World create,
But, who their Power, and Mysteries would know,
May to Agrippa, and Trithemius go.
But ah, how many scoff at Spirits, and
Deride the things they do not understand!
For more then ever Hell in this Prevails,
That Truth's are 'counted old-Wives idle Tales.
You self-conceited, who so slyly jere,
It Is happy for you Spirits disappear:
That God (for to convince you) don't affright
You, with the horrors of Aeternal Night,
With those black ^hades sprung from the Stygi^^ Sphere,
Which are (though unseen by you) conversant here.
You ignorants it is a sign you know
Scarce what belongs unto this world below,
Much less to those which from your blinder eye,
In vails of Pitch, and night enfolded lie.
Had I the Key that could your eyes unloc,
Had I the art to pull those Curtains back,
Or rub those scales off, which before them be,
You Truth, and Hell's black swarms at once should see:
You Would startle then into belief, and cry
W^'l never more that Spirits are deny.
Beside the numberless spiritual throng
Which do unto this outer world belong,
Within the Region of this world there are
Vast troops which come from the internal sphere,
Both from the dark Tartarean Center, and
From that Orb where does Loves great Prince command.
Being this world of good and bad's composed,
Spirits both good and bad are here disclosed,
For as these seek the hurt of man, so those
Their virtue to their venom do oppose.
Innumerable are the Sulph^y swarms
Hell belches forth to cause poor mortal harms,
Vast teter Troops continually from thence
Are sent to fight the battles of their Prince,
Who ranging through out the world contrive,
How they may man of bliss and rest deprive.
Go count the motes that in the Sunshine fly,
Go count the sands that on the shore do lie,
Go count the rol^ing billows of the sea,
Go count the stars that in the heavens be,
Number me those, and thou perhaps may tell
The Legions which do hither come from Hell:
Scarce is a place throughout this world so wide,
But where ten Millions of these spirits 'bide.
But now to match these evil spirits, come
There do as many, from the sacred womb
Of the Light-world; which sacred spirits do
Equal their numbers, and their powers too:
So that the world divided is betwixt
Them both, and of them good, and bad is mixed:
These seek to spill, kill, hurt and destroy man;
Those comfort, please, ease, help him all they can.
Nay gaze not round so with thine outer eye,
As if thou mean to give this truth the lie,
And 'cause thou blinded can not spirits see,
TO affirm, and boldly ^wear that none there ^e:
You Linccus tell me can thou see the wind?
If not, a spirit how that is more refined?
Winds blasts thou feel, if not made of steel,
So spirits dire effects I Am sure most feel,
Although they ignorant may be from whence
Proceeds their felt (tho unseen) influence.
Nay spread not so thine hands, and arms abroad
Thinking to feel, and catch them, 'cause I said
They every where did stand; forbear, forbear,
Open thine hand, and see how much of air
Thou ho^dst; spirits can pass thy body through,
Lie in thy bosom, yet not felt by you.
Nay gape not so, not snap at every blast,
As if thou spirits had a mind to taste,
For they into thy mouth themselves can put,
Its ruby gates, and strong porcullis shut.
Nor snuff the wind, as if thou meanest to smell
Them out, if near thee by the stink of hell,
To find them out thou surely now do think,
By their sulphurious smell, and Stygian stink.
They can deceive thee with the sweeter air,
Or fume themselves in thy perfumed hair:
But hell, and all its stinks lie round about
Thee, yet thou senseless can not smeel them out,
Nay prick not up thy ears to hear the noises
They make in going, nor to hear the voices
Of those that talk: they softly whisper, so
That thou not hear them can; on wool they go;
They talk can by thee, (yet thou never the near)
And never move the air unto thine ear.
We by our outer senses understand
Nothing, but what is composed of matter, and
Form, and what is corporal, and what
Not of a simple essence is, but that
Which of a mixture does partake I wis:
Each Spirit of a simple nature is; Para^el.

And therefore not to our outer senses subject,
Except connexed to some outer object,
Where there is Matter, Form, or co^po^eity:
(Which not in Spirits, nor the sacred Deity
Are simply) Spirits to our outer eye
And the other senses then do subject lie.
Mistake me not, that Spirits bodies have
I Will not deny: but these I do believe
Spiritual, and incorporeal are,
And of their Nature^ very much do share:
These also to our outward senses be
Not Subject. As I said the Deity
No form That is simply of it self, for as the Soul is not of matter, Form,
etc. yet it has a body wherein its Image is exhibited: So Spirits are not of
Matter, Form, etc. yet they have Bodies which are distinct from them, but not
as our gross bodies, subject to our outward senses, but to our inward: For had
they not bodies they could not be visible to our internal eyes which pierce
into their Kingdoms and habitations, which bodies, are of a very like nature to
themselves.

Now as the good Angels and Spirits have Bodies, wherein they are sensible of
all the blessings of the Eternal Sphere: So the evil Angels and Spirits ^ave in
which they are sensible, of the wrath and fiery property of the dark World:
For, without bodies there could be no sensibility, etc.

Their Bodies likewise are of a spiritual substance made out of Sulphur,
Mercury, and (...), in the inward ground of Eternal Nature the bodies both of
Angels and Devils being of the same Matter, but that those are Harmoniz'd by
the property of the Light or second Principles, these (...) by that of the dark
or first' P^inciple.


nor matter has: a body tho
It has, for Christ God's Body is we know.
Spirits not made of matter simply too,
Do bodies tho spiritual indue
Unto our inner senses they thereby,
Tho not to our outer senses ^i. e. may be seen, felt, heard, smelt, etc.
subject ly.
They therefore who acquainted are, with the
Internal Worlds, and their grand mystery,
Whose senses are unlock^d by that hand,
Which does all senses, and all World^s command,
Can Spirits see, and with Lincean eyes
Behold their Bodies, features, shapes, and guise:
Can also touch them, and their Bodies feel:
Can also taste them: and their scents can smell*
The Sulph'ry stinks, which from dark Spirits rise,
The sweet perfumes from those of Paradise:
Can also hear the Angels sacred Songs,
The dark Worlds Cursings belched from fiery Tongues.
These are Arcana's, which I Will not rehearse,
Cause scoffers breathes shall not betaint my Verse:
Whose these things see, see with enlightened eyes:
A word's enough unto the truly-Wise.
But go, unbelieving Thomas's, who swear
You will believe not that there Spirits are,
Except them with your outer eye you see,
Except they subject to your senses be;
Who scoff at the internal senses, See page
and
Deride as whimsies what you understand
Not: Spirits can (such Sadduces to fear)
In outer Bodies and groffe shapes appear:
So that your Ear, your Nose, your Hand, your Eye,
May them both (plainly) hear, smell, feel, and spy.
No forms there be within great Tellus womb,
But Spirits (freely may and) can assume:
And Spirits never come in shapes that fright:
The Evil cannot assume the shapes of Light.
Some starry Halos still attends the Good;
Some dark unbrattic shade the Stygian brood:
Good Spirits still in humane shapes appear,
In star-like Lights, or brightnesses more clear
Than tho third Orb's fair, and resplendant Queen;
Seldom in any other bodies seen:
The dark Orb's Spirits take an Humane garb,
Or any other shape within this Orb;
There is no creature among the numerous swarm,
But they into its likeness can transform
Themselves, and all such shapes assume, and use,
The which the Earth does any way produce;
However most times they assume the feature
Or of some ra^'nous, or some ugly creature.
But let good Spirits how they please appear,
Or in what'ever form, or figure here
Be manifest, a magic still attends
That does distinguish them from Hellish Fiends,
They bring good news, are messengers of joy,
They clear from fear, from sadness, and annoy
The Seers hearts by their sweet presence, and
Do make them what they are soon understand.
But those dark Fiends of the Tant^^ean Den,
How ever disguised strike horror into Men
By some hid Magic's secret influence
At the first sight: it is easy then from whence
They come to know; for tho, a sudden fear
The good may cause when they to men appear
Who'r unacquainted with them; recompense
That fear they do with a sweet influence
Which from their presence flows immediately,
Which them does ravish with its suavity.
Ask not what Tailor fits their fine array?
Or makes those clothes, or gowns so fit which they
Appear in often? or of what stuff they are made?
Who dons their garments? How they are arrayed?
They are self-Taylors, and self-helpers too,
And in a moment can all shapes indue.
Have they a mind for to be seen, they call
The Elements (who subject to their thrall
Do lie) unto their help: and then, of these
They form what Bodies (for themselves) they please,
But so composed that in a moment they
Can them dissolve, and soon disperse away.
Th'apt-to^ be-formed air, does matter yield
Fit for all shapes: for often I have beheld
The hanging clouds sometimes a Horse to frame,
Then to a Lion, or a Dog the same
Convert, and so vicessively, to make
A thousand Forms, a thousand shapes to take.
So most times Spirits (when here seen) ^do shroud
Themselves within some gross, and airy cloud,
Which they transform can to what shapes they please,
And then disperse them into air with ease:
For air condensed will admit we know,
Color, and Form, witness the clouds, and Bow.
Both Good, and Bad, the Elements can take
And of them for themselves fit bodies make,
The nimble Fire, the moistful Water, and
The Earth do subject lie to their command.
Dead bodies they can doubtless enter (that
Can them possess when in a living state)
And ever they are rotten agitate them so
That they about (as if alive) may go.
Mouth, Arms, Legs, Tallons, and such members they
(Their force, and powers better to display)
Assume of a gross substance: with their Hands
At once they fell a thousand armed Bands,
With their sharp tallons pierce the flesh, and beat
To dust the top of Taurus with their Feet.
With Swords, and such like instruments they slay,
Beat, strike, and wound, and fiercely chase away
Mortals sometimes: But doubtless they may these
Things do w'thout Arms, or members if they please.
But whenever Spirits Bodies here
Assume, and to our outer Eye appear,
They put on such as may convenient be,
And with their inner Bodies best agree,
For look what shapes their inner Bodies have,
Such shapes, (if visibly appear) they crave:
I cannot better represent it than
Thus: Let a waxen Picture of a Man
Be made complete, exactly like, and fit
And Hollow, let the Man then into it
Be put, the Picture's like the Man, but he
In it enclosed close you cannot see:
So Spirits when they 'ppear unto our eye
Their bodies cloth with visibility;
So that the outer forms the, assimulate
In all things answer their internal state,
But that those shapes our outer eyes may see,
These seen may only by our inner be.
But how should I this Volumn swell if that
I mention should what Histories relate!
Concerning those stupendous acts (which made
Men wonder much) of spirits good, and bad,
The title of which would swell too high for me,
And ask more she^ts than in this book shall be.
So that I wonder much that men should grow
S' incredulous; think there is no Spirit, though,
Plenty of actions their beliefs might gain,
As not to judge the Melancholic brain,
Or fantasy to be the Father that
Did Acts of Spirits Good, and bad create.
So palpable they are that who denies
Them, may as well Histories Verities
Question in all things else. Perversity
Sticks not to give the Sun it self the Lie.
What were those spirits that Eubatis house
In Corinth haunted? What was that did use
For to disturb Pausanias his rest?
Or that who Nero did so much molest?
Or that which Otto terrified? Or those
That used to sport about the shady brows
Of the sad grave of cursed Coligula?
What was that air and pestilential Ray,
Which from Apollo's Fane at Babylon
Flew the row the Earth, which was no sooner gone
From whence (it seems) it had been lock^^ up,
But all the World drank Plague's infernal Cup
And what were those so often appeared unto
Lancastrian, and Warbosian witches too?
What spirit Job tormented! What was he
Caused Sarah Raguels, Daughters misery, Io^ 1. Tobit 7.

Forcing her Grooms by Hymen crowned at noon,
To pass the Ferry-boat of Charon soon?
I should want time to write. and you to read
Should I but mention every horrid deed
Of evil Spirits, which in History
Is noted: who shall doubt this verity?
But one I Will here recite, Niderius Nidor. lib. ult. Formic.

His Pen the same made known has unto us.
Upon the Confines of Bohemia lies
A Stygian Vale, where shady Mountains rise
^urden'd with aged trees, whose bushy heads
Fill th'under-lying Vale with horrid shades,
Denying Phoebus in the brightest Day
Leave amply there for to project his Ray.
Here every Night after that Sol was gone
To court Queen Thetis in the Ocean,
And that the horrid shaddows of the Night
With pitchy Vailes had mu^^led up the Light;
Hell and its Princes mustered their Forces,
Their bands of Footmen, and their Troops of Horses,
And in disport to Exercise, and play,
Their Stygian Troops, imbattel'd in array,
They did divide, meeting with strange effort
Pel-mell they joined, and skirmish'd thus in sport.
^he Mountains echoed, and the Valleys rung
With the strange noises of this Stygian throng,
The air re-ratled with their Canons noise,
Their armours clashing, and the horrid voice
Of fighting, roaring, howling, hissing Fiends,
Like to the loud-mouth Thunder, when it rends
The tallest Cedars, and the strongest Rocks
With unresistible, and deadly knocks.
Here flakes of fire, here curled Clouds of Fume,
With Sulphur mixed, and other stinks did come
From out the Vale, as if that Aetna there
Had spet his fiery entrals in the air,
And by and by they such a yell would send
As if at once they Heaven, and Earth would rend:
Pompey and Caesar on the fatal Plain
Of Pharsalia, or great Tamerlaine,
And Ba^azet, great Alexander, and
Darius who all Asia did command
Met with less clamor* and less noise of arms
Then made these Devils with infernal Charms:
Through the gentle air these ^lamours fly
Which gave Alarums to the dwellers by,
The fearful ran away, the stoutest dare
Not go to see what fighting Foes these were:
Until at last two stout, and hardy Knights
Ala^um'd with these noyses several Nights,
Accounting it disgrace for them who were
The Sons of Mars for to admit of Fear,
Resolved to go into the Vale, and see
Who those noctarnal Combatants might be.
The night appointed armed, and mounted they
Dauntlesse, and stout, together take their way,
Fair Phaebe tripping the row the azure skies,
Favored with smiles of light their enterprise,
And on the Rode her silver beams does shed,
Which to this Close, and haunted Valley led:
By whose fair beams of Light discry they might
Two Armies battail'd, and prepared to fight
Their Troops well marshaled, pressed, and ready bent,
And Colors streaming in each Regiment,
The Foot prepared, the Horsemen mounted, and
The Artillery fitted, and in order stand:
Here Drumms were beat, here Fifes were played upon,
Here the shril-sounding Trumpets strongly blown
Tantara go, and other music, that
Men pressed to blood, and rage does animate.
This seen, the heart of one strong fear subdues,
And farther on to go he does refuse,
I'ave seen enough (said he) nor is it good
To match with Friends for feeble Flesh, and Blood,
Let Us now retire, while that we may, from these
Fiends, and not dally with such Prodigi^s.
Coward stay thou (the other strait replies)
I^le try their metal ever I go: Then hies
Upon the gallop to these Armies, but
He in the midst is by a Champion met;
They draw their Weapons, stoutly fight, but he
Strait loses both his head, and Victory.
The other less Foolhardy flies; relate
He does next day, this Champions desperate Fate,
The People thither go by heaps: The dead
Body they find, some furlongs from his Head,
But neither print of men's feet, nor of Horses
Nor any sign of all these warlike Forces
Were to be seen: Such stories Histories
Afford in plenty. And let this suffice.
Nor are the sacred Acts of Spirits good,
Inferior or less frequent than the Bad,
^or they do mortals help as often still,
As those black Fiends appear to do them ill.
Does not the sacred Writ most clearly shine
In every place with Angels Acts divine?
What were those Sacred Nuncio's that came, Genesis 18.

And eat, and drank, and Talked with Abraham?
They eat, and drank, not that they needed it,
For unto nothing soon resolved their m^at.
And who were those who Lot protected, Genesis 19.
from
The Sulph'ry flames which did on Sod^m come?
That the Egyptians firstborn slew? Exodus 12. 29.
and that
Which did Senac'hrib's Host exterminate?
That which with Manoa commun'd, 2 Kings 19.
and he
Which Daniel helped in his extremity?
Which talked with Esdras? Judges 13.
and those five that fought
In golden arms for Macha^eus stout? Dan. 6. 22.

And what was he who Mary visited? 2 Esd. 4.

And he who Peter from his prison led? 2 Mac. 10. 30.

Full every where are holy Histories,
Of holy Acts of Angels like to these, Luke 1.

Who by the Mandate of their masters Will Acts 12.

Attend the good of Fragil mortal still:
This one I Will cite, to them who more would know
The Ecclesiastic Histories will show.
When Christianism's fair, Marull.
and sacred Light
Contested with the foul, Spalat. lib. 1. cap. 8.
and cursed Night
Of Paganism; Then the raging Fiends,
Brought many Saints unto most cruel ends,
And then the holy Angels of the Lord,
Bestirred themselves to propagate his Word,
And in the Christians great extremities,
Applied choice comforts to their Miseries:
So that with hearts undaunted evermore,
The Rage, and fury of Hel's Prince they bore.
Among the rest stout LAURENTINUS, and
His valiant brother PERGENTINUS stand
As Champions stout, and bid defiance to
Hell: their pernicious and immortal Foe.
Their holy Tongues fiered with Zeal decry
The Heathens Idol, and Idolatry:
Their holy charms enchain the Peoples hearts,
And Sathaa's wounded by the sacred darts
Shot from their pious mouths; and fearing now
To be o're-come voweth their overthrow.
TIBURTIUS then Areciam's Lord is bent
To be (the Prince of STYX) his Instrument:
He these seeks to dissuade, but all in vain*
They scorn his hony'd words, and sugared train,
The more TIBURTIUS lauds his Jupiter,
The more he up their holy zeal does stir.
Enraged he as Satan did command
Caused them with cruel cords for to be bound,
And then with batts for to be beaten ^ore,
Till their white backs were covered with gore.
But mark an Angel with a steely wand
And frowning brows does by these Martyrs stand
Unseen, he strikes their Executioners,
Which blow its dyre effects full soon infers;
For strait their arms, who beat these Martyrs so,
Are now not able for to strike a blow,
Dried up they are like sticks; their sinnews shrunk
And dryth has up their strength, and vigor drunk:
Cruel Tiberius then to prison hales
These Brothers: (Hell now claps on all his Sails;
Blown with the blasts of Rage, fell mischiefs barque
Seeks to o'rewhelm the Christian's new-built Ark)
There as it were within the jaws of Hell,
Where horrid Night, and Stygian stinks did dwell,
Where mire, and filthy dirt, and stinking dung
Bespread the floor, and the black wall's behung:
There are the Brothers, noble Brothers put,
And there from food, as well as Light are shut.
But stay Tiburtius, it is not thou can keep
Food from these Martyrs: Christ will feed his sheep:
And tho ten thousand Iron bars behem,
He in the foulest hole will feast with them.
A sacred Angel now Hel's Rage withstands,
And notwithstanding his severe Commands,
Brings every day food to these close shut up:
With which they bountifully dine, and sup.
In vain Tiburtius every day enquires
Which of the constant brothers first expires,
In vain he waits (and still in vain he may)
To hear the cruel cutthroat keepers say
That they were starved to death: He waits in vain,
Raging therefore he now will have them slain.
This cruel Monster, and right Stygian Heir
Does now a walk of burning Coals prepare;
And (cruel) forces these two Saints to stalk
With naked feet upon this fiery walk:
The glowing Coals (charged by the Angel so)
Kiss their sweet feet unhurt as they do go,
Fast locking up their burning quality
As splendant Gemms under their feet do lie.
But all this will not serve their turns; for now
Unto JOVE'S Image they are bid to bow,
Instead of Jove to Jesus strait they cry,
When one of his blessed Chore does thither fly,
Touching the Idol with his sacred hand,
Prodigiously converts the same to sand,
The brass resolved to dust falls on the ground,
Whilst Heathen Iesu's blessed Name re^ound.
Such were the acts of holy Angels, then
Frequent, tho now so seldom seen by men.
And what is the reason that these Sons of Light
Seem as it were now to eschew our sight?
Why don't they now appear as they were wont
To do, in former ages? and why don't
They show their kind familiarity
But hide themselves in veiled obscurity?
Some think the sins of Men the cause; See p.
and sure
Angels love to converse with none but pure
Men like themselves: and though this may not be
The only Cause of their obscurity
Unto our outer eye, yet sure I am,
Man's inner converse hindered by the same
Is, for while Men lie plunged in the mire
Of sin, they cannot behold these sparks of fire.
Others suppose the Church confirmed now,
Has no such need as heretofore for to
Be strengthened, therefore Angels don't appear,
And therefore miracles now ceased are.
Others do think (and sure their reason's good)
Since God himself put on our flesh and Blood, Mr. Lawrence Communion and war
with Angels. page 16.

And since that Iesu's blessed Humanity
For ay inthroned is in Heaven on high,
That Mortals should Spiritualized be,
And him by Faith, in Truth, and Spirit see.
For the Internal World's now opened are,
And Spiritual Treasures more then ever they were,
So that Man now converse with Angels may
In a more Spiritual, and nearer way,
For Angels tho they don't appear, do Love
Men as they did, and round him daily move,
For to defend him from all hurt, and Harm,
With Magic vigor of their powerful arm.
They willing are still to converse with Men
Who lay aside the letting Vailes of Sin.
But what is the reason seeing Spirits have
Such power here, that the Ill do not bereave
Man of his Life? and with their shapes affright
Him from his Reason, Wits, and Senses quite?
Why don't they haunt Man with continual terror?
And show themselves in t^eir dread shapes of horror?
Why don't they muster all the Winds? and tear
The Rocks a^^^nder? and the Mountains bear
Un^o some City pashing with the stones
Both Towers, and Walls, Houses, and Men at once?
Why don't they move the Raging Seas, and make
At once a Kingdom, or a Land, a Lake?
And since a power to slaughter men they have
Why don't they sweep whole Towns into the grave?
Being they are to mischief always bent,
Why make they Man to be their Instrument?
The Devil Man's subtle and crafty foe
Charges his slaves, (...)
that they th^mselves do show
T^ none, but such whom he'^ assured are
(...), and bound (...) his Iron snare:
For he is afraid if he should men affright
With the black shadows of the dismal Night,
And should in's horrid shapes be seen, that they
(Since Men in fear, are then most apt to pray
For help to God) should through a sense of fear
On goodness think, and from their sins forbear:
And lest that many, who no Hell believe
Now; he by this means should re-undeceive
Beside the shame, of their foul blot, and stain
From often appearing does them much restrain,
For they do know Man knows their fall, and strait
They hang their heads if he the same relate.
Therefore they are much enraged if any spy
Them will they, nil they, with an inner eye.
But chiefly this restrains them: Well they know
Their ministry, and what they are to do
Spiritual is, and that they need not come
In shapes, nor Corporeity assume.
They are to tempt Man unto Sin, and they
That very well can do a better way
Than to be seen, into the fancy press
They do and there suggest all wickedness.
Sleeping, and waking, Night, and Day, they do
Disturb the fancy, and the senses too.
So that they will not appear unto the eye
Except they think they an advantage spy.
But why Man's Life they do not take away
Nor all the order of the World destroy
Is this: IEHOVA whose black slaves they be
Holds in his Hand their chains extremity,
So that like Bandoggs they may bark, and grin,
But cannot hurt unless he lose the chain:
Which loosed (for sins correction) strait they rome
And upon man with rage, and fury come.
Likewise we must not think the Angels idle,
But that they still their rage, and fury bridle,
Opposing still the rigor of their arms,
Against the venom of their spells, and charms:
So that with wisdom, and with might they can
Avert their plots, and stratagems from Man.
But I suppose, did God give Satan leave,
He would not Men, as most suppose, deprive
Of Life (tho I confess his furious spite
Effect much harm, and desolation might)
For what good would it do for him to Crown
At once the whole World with a Martyrdom?
For what good would it do him to destroy
Man? for himself by it he would more annoy:
It Is not this Life of Man he seeks, but the
Soul's company with him Aeternally:
Therefore he would have Men in prosperity,
And's loath to see them in Adversity.
In eas^, and pleasure Men to sin are subject,
Disease stirs up to a Caelestial object.
If Satan should Man's hand so agitate
That he should burst in twain the thread of Fate
Of any one: answer shall he the fact
If that his will concurred not with the act?
Then Daemonaicks must be guilty too
Of whatsoever they in their fits do do.
Satan knows well enough what ever ill in
Their minds he puts, imputed sha'n't for sin
Be unto them, unless their will they shall
Conjoyn thereto. This sin we rightly call.
Therefore he tempts, well knowing that he can
Not hurt: for Man himself must murder Man.
H^rt from himself does flow; (...)
but cunning he
Makes Man betray himself to misery.
But if that any persecute he would
His Rage, and spite would be against the Good,
Whom he should think were past his reach, or those
Who naked should themselves to him expose,
Hoping thereby to make them sin, or that
They should grow through oppression desperate.
But God who bounds the Seas, does Hell command,
And binds the Devils with the self-same Hand.
Man as the Sages not untruly said
Peculiar Genii has both good and bad:
Each good Man has an Angel guardian, Mat. 13. 10.

And evil Demon has each evil Man
For to attend upon him; one does still
Egg Man to Good, the other unto ill.
As does a careful Nurse attend the child
She suckles, lest by harm it be beguiled,
Or hurt, and as she joys to see it grow
In strength, and all perfections; even so
The Angel tu^ular attends his Ward,
And daily it does from all evil guard:
He joys to see his charge to grow apace
In Heaven's perfections, and the strength of Grace:
He guards his charge from ills, and does undo
Hel's plots, and snares, and stops his fury too.
And were it not for such an Angel's guard,
To shun Hel's snares, a Saint would find it hard.
What owe we then unto Heaven's Love, that sends
So good a Nurse that Man so frankly tends?
So evil Men, ill Demons wait upon,
Who joy to see them in Hel's Races run,
They have their several charges too, and they
Also upon their charge attend always:
Each seeks his charge to hale to TOPHET, even
As the good Angel to bring his to Heaven.
Sometimes these Genii bodies take, and then
Themselves they do exhibit unto men:
For Bishop Bruno heard a voice cry thus;
No Bishop! I am thy ev'l Genius,
E're long I Will fetch thee: and e're long indeed
A Roof fell down upon his cursed head. Plutarch:

So Marcus Br^tus his ev'l Genius spied
(Whose Fate presaged) the night before he died Vit:

Cassius Parmensis saw a Daemoa that
With horrid looks presaged his evil Fate,
Who being asked what he was? he thus
Replied; I am thy evil Genius.
Good Men likewise have their own Genii seen
And with them also conversant have been.
B^din relates a story of a Man
Who was directed by his Guardian
Angel, at all times, who forewarned him still
(That he prevent it might) of any ill
That threat'ned him: or if he did not well
He by some sign him of it still would tell:
And every morning (such his holy care
Was) him awaked, and stirred him up to prayer;
And every night he in a dream did show
Those accidents that should next day ensue:
So that he was fore-armed still, and thus
Preserved till Death by his good Genius.
One Jacob Behre, In vita Behm.
a very pious Man
By prayer obtained an Angel Guardian.
Which both himself, and's Wife saw every Night
About their Bed, like to a shining Light.
Such is God's Love, and such the Angels care,
That we as children, they as Nurses are.
I do believe that there are many now
That by the guidance of their Angels go,
Steer as they do direct; are guided by
And have converse with their own Genii.
And tho, men may not often see their own
Genii; and though themselves they have not shown
Often; unseen they act and do direct
Our actions, and us from Hel's harms protect.
They do inspire us, and as God commands,
Sometimes they help, sometimes withold their Hands.
Good Angels help good men, the evil still
Entice, and draw them to the pits of ill.
Most men are by Good, or 'ill Genii led,
In all their actions, tho they are undescry'd:
Therefore behold within the Globe I paint
An Angel Guardian waiting on a Saint:
An evil Demon, which another leads,
Who in the paths of sin, and Tart'rus treads.
But the deep Magic of each mystic Sphere
We shall (below at full) describe, See p. and p.
not here.
We here proceed shall (tho in homely garb)
To show the Myst'ries of this outer Orb.
(...) This Wo^ld from the inward Worlds its being gat,
And of their natures does participate.
The curse with blessings, good with bad does blend.
Both Centres hither do their forces send:
This is the stage on which both act, it is here
Their influence, and power does appear:
This is the field, in which these powers do band,
And strive which of them may Man's heart command.
This is the receptacle, here below
For Heaven and Hell their Wonders both to show:
So that here is as 'twere conjoined in one
Both Sodom, Egypt, and Jerusalem.
The Devil, crafty in his hellish art,
Rejoiced much to see this World produced
From two more inward beings, now he used
His utmost skill, and it stood him upon,
This World's, and Adam's soul in union
For to conjoyn, For well he thereby knew
A place of pleasure should to him accrue.
Infernal Spirits find some ease, They Would rather enter the herd than return to
the fiery Center.

The herd of Swine they would rather enter, than
Return into their smoaky hole again:
Leaving their fiery Center, they as 'twere
Come forth of prison for to take the air:
Here they disport themselves; and closely lurk
With eagerness to do their fathers work,
Which is to draw the immortal Souls of men,
For to inhabit their Sulphurious den.
The Devils tremble when they think upon
This outward Fakrick's dissolution,
For then more strictly shall they wrapped be
In their own Center to Aeternity.
This wily Serpent all his craft did use,
His poison the row this Earth for to diffuse^
Which he no way effect could: The fall,
b' Adam's lapse
Only a way is made; He him intraps,
Assaults his free will, does expose to view
This World's rare beauties when 'twas formed new:
Shows him the tree forbid, whose dangling fruit
So pleasing, with a new made creature suit
He well knew would: This was the only gate*
By which he hoped to overthrow him at.
He knew be^orehad the sad consequence
Of Adam's ^all: Therefore he strives from whence
He wa^ created to attract him; and
Thereby to lessen him of his Command.
Adam was King, sole Prince, and Lord of all
The Earth, but lost it by his fatal fall.
Satan knew, he millions of Souls should gain
By this means, to increase his hellish train;
And hoped (it may be) for to conquer all
That should produced be on this earthly Ball,
If Adam should not fall, (i. e)
he likewise knew,
He in this World should nothing have to do,
But should be banished quite, which is the The first Principle overcome, the
second, or Paradise, through all.

Is promised, for which the Angels wait;
To see Hel's power banished, He^v'n's alone
To have with this World's Spirit union:
Then shall the curse be fled, and Paradise
To flourish here we shall see with our eyes.
But Adam's fatal lapse, from what, to what,
In bri^f my slender Muse shall now relate.

what Images there Spiritual
Were, he gave them substance corporeal,
And by his Fiat this great Machine made
Of naught: and in such form and order laid
This huge vast Mol^s, (or live creature, some
So have affirmed, I'n this a Skeptic am)
That there no disagreeing seeds appeared,
All was by order, weight, and measure reared.
Heaven, Earth, Air, Seas, Fire, Water, Land, and all
Beasts, Fishes, Serpents, Birds, the which this Ball
I^ hab^ted, they so created were
That they partak'd of each internal Sphere:
And though those Kingdoms ever disagree,
Were in the World in complete harmony,
So had the great Creator ordered it,
And them so in their place, and order set,
That there was no disunion, for that seed
Of disagreement conquered was, and hid:
The lighter World was Master, the other did
Obey as servant, and all things were good.
To what served this the brutish Animal
God's mighty Wonders in their earthly Ball
Contemplate could not: God Almighty then
In his own holy likeness formed Man;
His shape it may be somewhat like to this
We now do bear: But his pure Body was
Composed of Sulphur, Mercury, and Sal,
Out of the inward ground spiritual. See p.

Its nature was, as all things then create,
Most pure, and good, and in a perfect state.
Into this new-made Form God breathed then
The breath of Life, Genesis 2. 7.
which gave a Soul to Man,
Which Soul Eternal is; so framed by God
That from three Kingdoms it its being had:
Three Essences do it compose; so made
That it may stand, or be to hell betrayed:
Or like an empty Vacuum, which is
Capable to be filled with Woe, or Bliss:
For what the Soul cleaves most unto when she
Puts off this case, she to Aeternity
Enjoys. Nor is she God as some do deem,
But 's expressed Word, or Breath to me does seem:
Or a shot Ray from that diviner Sun,
Who is in all things, and is yet but One.
Adam thus made, perfect, and good, by God
In Paradise is placed, a blessed abode:
Then was the golden age indeed, Earth gave
Nor Weeds, nor Thorns, but clothed in liv'ry brave
Had a perpetual spring; continual green
In every place, on every tree was seen:
No dainty Flower, which art makes now to flourish,
But then the Earth did naturally nourish.
A constant verdure it retained, and then
With thousand flowers spotted was the green:
Each tree at one time bore both fruit, and flower;
Each herb to heal, but not to hurt had power.
No sharpness in the fruit, no naughty smell,
The worst fruit then, our best now, did excel:
No hurtful herb, no poisonous Root grew there,
Of 'ts own accord the Earth all things did bear,
No Summer's parching heat, nor Winter's cold
There was: one temperature did all infold.
Boreas broke not his Hyperborea^ den,
Nor did wet Auster, or that Eurus wen
From theirs: A pleasing Zepher only kissed
The waving trees: No cloud nor foggy mist
Caused from the Earth's ill vapors; she had none:
No Sea-got cloud arose between the Sun
And the pregnant Earth; no sudden storms of Rain:
No snow, no hail, nor thundering was there then.
Tempestuous Orion threatened not the Seas;
Nor showed the time to sail the Pleiades.
Saturn had then no naughty influence,
A fructifying power came from thence:
The Planets not in opposition moved:
The Heavens, the Earth, the Earth the Heavens loved:
Heaven sent no storms Earth's beauties to deface,
Earth with dull mists dimmed not Heavens brighter face:
No starr there was that had ill influence,
All Rays were blessed that were projected thence.
All things in perfect Harmony agreed:
In Heaven, nor Earth, was there discording seed.
The Lion, with the Lamb did play, the Bear
Robbed not the Bees; nor sheep the Wolf did fear.
The crested Cock undauntedly stood by
The Fox, as then devoy'd of sublety:
The Toad no venom had; nor poisonous sting
The Scorpion: Nor did then the Birds great King
Feed on the rest: nor did the Falcon prey
Upon the Dove: nor Fishes in the Sea
Did feed the Cormorant: the lesser fry
Fed not the greater, nor was enmity
Then found in Birds, in Fishes, or in Beast:
LOVE all conjoined, in Love all still did feast.
ADAM is Lord, and King: each animal
Comes at his beck, and does obey his call;
All bow their lofty heads if he comes near,
The Heart, nor timorous Hare his presence fear,
The shaggy Lion, Bear, the Bull, the Bore,
Couch at his feet, him as their God adore.
He wanted not then, as we now do want,
Help from the Beasts, nor physic from the plant,
Meat from the Fowls, and Fishes: nor had he
So gross a Body to be fed, as we.
Upon the tree of Life he only fed;
No vapors then arose to dull his head;
No sleep ever closed his watchful eyes; nor knew
He want of it; no hunger did accrue.
His soul like ours was not i. e. Laboring under an imperfect sight.
parturient,
He saw the row all things, knew what all things meant:
Gave names to all the Creatures, and did frame
Them, as their natures so he gave their Name.
Nor did he want the Camel, nor the Horse
To carry him, he in himself had force
Enough to move his Body, and to bear
It where he list, over Sea, or the row the Air.
No water could his Body drown, nor fire
Consume; nor subject was it to Death's dread ire.
It then immortal was imperishable;
Corporeal, and yet unalterable
He such a Body had as Christ had on
After his glorious Resurrection.
In this state ADAM stood; but God foresaw
The woe that he soon on himself would draw:
Therefore he thus forewarns him: New made Soul!
Work of my Hands, in whom no pheeces foul
Remain! a second Deity! O thou
For ay may live! Thou art immortal now;
Thou art an Angel, and I thee prefer
For to possess the Throne of LUCIFER.
For this end did I thee Create, that the
Voy'd Throne of LUCIFER, possessed might be:
Thou shall enjoy, and if thou stand'st upright,
The Eternal mansions of never fading Light.
Look to thy self therefore, for thou may guess
LUCIFER envy will thy happiness;
He Will strive to overthrow thee, and to gain
Thee to the mansions of ^^ernal pain.
You Are now in Paradise, thy soul does move
In my bright Kingdom of Aeternal Love.
Now take thy choice; I thee a free will give;

Instead of Light, an Ang^l thou will be

Thou see now what thou ought to do; stand fast,
But forty days will thy temptation last,

ADAM'S now left alone in Paradise
Unto the mortal Principle his eyes
He turns: For he has no desire to prove
The wrathful Kingdom; He Is quite out of Love
With it; abhorrs it, turns his eyes away,
And lets them on this lower Orb to stray.
With it he is capt^vated, and his Lust,
Puts after it; he it desires to taste.
Or thus more properly: These Kingdoms three
In equal Concord placed in Adam be.
Nor the dark World, nor this low Orb, to prove
Should he desire; but that Orb of Love;
In that alone should his desire have gone,
With that, not these for to have union.
But his desire soon awakened
The humane property; unmaried
He quickly was from the second Principle
When once from it unto the third he fell*
His Body changed is; or the other this
More base indues: Strange Metamorphosis!
What was before diaphanous, and clear,
Not now transparent; muddy does appear:
What was like air, is now like Earth; what light
Now Is heavy; and for an unbounded sight,
Each object intervening hinders:
For an immortal, now a mortal breath
He draws: His Body which before could fly
Clogged now is with a load of flesh, does lie
Fixed to this Orb: his quicker pace now is gone,
He tries to fly but he can scarcely run:
He tries the Waters, at the Rivers brinks,
Pass as before he could not, now he sinks
Unto the bottom: that same Element
Small aid for to support his body lent.
Adam's amazed, and in the Crystal Glass
Of Waters, he beholds his limbs, and Face,
He feels his hair, his nose, his teeth, his flesh,
Then views, then feels, then views himself afresh.
Then tries to use his nimble feet; the Reeds
In running cut his naked legs, he bleeds;
He feels the smart, he wonders more at this,
And strangeth at his Metamorphosis.
With this gross body, he a lesser sight
Gains; he has lost the immense, and heaven'ly Light
He had before. A smaller intellect
And understanding now he has: Direct
Himself he cannot; he finds his body's case
Like heavy shakels pin him to the place:
Anon dull (i. e.) His lotsing (or sleeping to) the heavn'ly Image, by being
awakened to the earthly.
sleep sits on his eyes, and he
The Row out his body feels a Lethargy;
Extended on the verdant grass he lies
And foundly sleeps with fast closed eyes.
God sees this lapse, he pitys him; he saw
His heavenly Image from his sight withdraw:
ADAM his knowledge lost, and power too:
Help now himself he cannot; this did accrue
By's lapse; but had he stood in Paradise
His blessed estate, had then been on this wise.
God's Image then he should have born for aye
But not as now, obscured with clogs of clay;
The heavenly part should the row the outward shine;
Free as the air; his meat, and drink divine;
Nor as we eat, should he have eaten then,
Magically, yet with mouth, lips, and tongue,
But not into the body, there is no vent
And nothing could turn into Excrement.
No need should he have had of carnal food,
The Beasts, nor Fowls could do him little good;
But God forese'ing he would lapse from this blessed state.
Did therefore them for's future helps create.
And yet he should have had his senses free,
In higher measure, and full purity.
Nor should he have continued alone,
(Such members as we have now he had none
To propogate) he magically, as
The Sun's bright beams the waters surface pass
Does, without pain, so should he have brought forth
In Paradise. By a Caelestial birth,
He should in God's blessed Image more have got,
Aeternal all, none subject to Fate's Lot.
He should both Father be, and Mother then,
For Male, and Female God created Man:
Both Man, and Woman, Wife, and Virgin he
Together was, in State of purity.
God saw that he, in this new lapsed state;
Had lost the power now to propogate;
Deterred by that vail of flesh: so would
He have continued still; nor ever could
From's loins an issue spring. God just and true,
T'whom future things are present, all fore-knew,
Therefore that VENUS, or that power he had
In him, before to propagate, he clad
In flesh like him; and of his life, and being
Framed his EVE: both in all things agreeing.
Man once was whole-man, but now broke alas!
Is but the half of what at first ^e was:
Such members then, as we have now they gat,
Fit, (as the Beast does) for to propogate.
ADAM awakes, and views his new made EVE,
He knows she is part of's self; does to her cleave,
And upon her his sole desire does cast,
With her he joys, in her he takes repast.
In Paradise as yet they were, for sin
Actually had yet not entered in,
Nor was the vanity awaked as yet,
God's blessed Image in their souls was set,
Though much obscured: In great felicity
And Joy they lived, not knowing vanity,
Nor Good, nor Evil; Could they so have stood
They had been blessed, for their state was good.
Their pronity unto a farther Fall
God saw, therefore he thus to them does Call.
Great Protoplast! and Prince of Paradise!
Take heed thou losest not these happy Joys
Once more I thee forewarn: already thy
Imagination in Earth's property
Did work: thou see what thou thereby have lost,
Thy Earthly Body did a better cost,
Of one, thou now art twain; the Habiliments
A Body made up of the Elements,
Which yet no jar does know; nor cold, nor heat
Thy exposed flesh the temperate air does threat.
My Heavenly power yet does penetrate,
And cloth thy Body in this naked state,
Nor know thou good, or ill: In Harmony
Thou art; nor is awaked Hel's property
As yet: therefore if thou would stand for aye,
Obey what I command; mark what I say.
See thou the happy pleasures of this place?
What verdant Groves, This is meant of the second Principle, where Adam should
constantly feed, and where there is always a coatinual variety, and full plenty
of that Heavenly meat which entises the soul, and which is freely given:
and flowring Trees do grace
This blessed Soul? how many Trees do suit
Thy dainty pallat, with their happy fruit?
How many thousands here, in order set
Fit for thy food do court thy lips to eat?
Here, here is choice, nor will their sweetness cloy
Thy stomach, nor their acritude annoy
Thy taste; their substance is Ambrosia, and
Their Liquor Nectar: Zeph^rs to thy hand
Do blow the laden bows; spare not to eat
Thou can not su^fet with this pleasing Meat.
Nor need thou to lay up store, nor fear
To want; Continually these Trees do bear;
The Fruit renews as fast as thou can pull;
All here is good, yet thou thy choice may cull.
See but what store there is, enough for thee,
And thousands more. Amongst these Trees, one Tree,
And but one This is the Tree of good, and evil, which is the spirit of this
World, in which the Devil had shed his ^ssence, though it was not manifested,
nor should have been, but by Adam's putting his mind into it, and transgressing
the Command of God: then the Devils Tincture prevailed, and the Curse blended
with the Blessing, and so Paradise was lost. * (i. e.) They shall utterly (dye
to, or) lose the Hav'nly Image: or be so obscured as is now in us through
Adam's Transgression, that unless by Christ, it had been impossible to recover
it again.
Tree will I deba^ thee from,
Near that I charge thee, that you never come;
See where it stands surrounded with the rest,
Placed in the Garden's Center: See it is dressed
Not like the other Trees, from the other thou
May easily know it, by each leaf and bow.
Nor think that I would bar thee from this Tree,
Did not I know it would prove Death to thee,
Should thou but eat thereon. You Are ignorant
Oft's nature, and what liquor virulent
Its fruit contains. Therefore I say beware,
Shun thou the thought of it, and do not dare
To taste of it? Let not the Devil entice
Thee unto it, for if thou do thou *dy'st;
Tho^ Paradise shall loose, and thou shall see
The World endu'd with fatal misery:
The curse shall spring the row out the Earth, and thou
In pleasure shall no longer live, as now;
But shall with pain, and labor, cold, and heat,
Sorrow, and care, and trouble get thy meat.
Look to thy self, let not the Devil thee
Provoke, to eat on this See more of this Tree. page
forbidden Tree
For if thou do, thou will it soon repent,
For breaking this my just Commandment.
The Devil like a Gamester, who has lain
All that he has at stake, and is undone
If that he lose: or like some General
Encamped before some rich, strong City Wall,
In whose subversion he is assured to gain
A mass of Treasure, and eternal Fame,
Does play his part, and uses all his skill
To win the Game, and conquer Adam's Will,
He fears if Eve the new-made World increase
Should with some pretty Babe in Paradise
Ever that the Wrath awak'ned was, he should
Miscarry in his great design, nor could
He then so easily have drawn from good,
Their brighter souls, when they so long had stood.
A Captain who some Castle thinks to take
By stratagem, an hundred plots does make
In's brain, resolves on this, and then on that,
Then likes this, then likes another plot:
Anon he spies some danger, or defect
In that; his thoughts some other thing Erect,
And then to work he sets his busy brain,
Until his thoughts have perfected the train:
Which well disgested, unto work he goes,
Undauntedly resolves to win or lose;
So subtle Satan after many wiles,
Thus our first Parents cunningly beguiles.
Amongst the other Beasts that did resort
As humble servants unto ADAM'S Court,
There was a Serpent whose fine speekled hide,
And pretty features with rare colors died,
Had gained EVE'S Love, and who it may be had
Entwined about her naked neck, and played
With her white hands; or favored in her lap:
This Satan thought was best her to entrap.
Into this Beast he (i. e) He awakens the first Principle in it (which was in
all connexed with the second or good, but in equal harmony and agreement)
sh^dding his Essence in the very creation of it from whence it had its
subtilty, though i^ it self it was good. S^e Behm. Mist. Magnum, page 89. 90.
goes, and still does lie
About the Tree forbid: Eve's longing eye
Full often salutes that fatal Tree; desire
She does to taste the fruit, approaching nigher
The subtle Serpent frisking on the Tree
She spies: The shadow cannot hurt, thinks she.
Nearer she goes; thinking on God's Command
She fears for to proceed, then makes a stand,
But still the more she thought she was forbid,
The more she longs, the more desire she did.
(The same we still retain, for even thus
We most desire what is forbid to us)
She steps a little forward; then retires
Then moves again: tempted by her desires
She does the Tree approach. God's stricter Law
Affright's her; she is about for to withdraw:
Satan s^'ing her the place about to leave,
Thus through the Serpent tempts our Grandame Eve.
Great Mistress of this World, our gracious Queen,
Commandresse of this mighty Orb terrene,
Why so unwilling to approach this Tree,
Which I the best judge in this Grove to be?
Me thinks you seemed to dread the shade thereof
When you unwilling to approach, aloof
Stood looking on it: As yet you seem to fear
The very shade; as if some hurt dwelt here.
Tell, what is in it that can displease you thus?
Eve answers then: The Lord commanded us
To please our tastes, with the variety
Of all those fruits which in this Garden be,
Only this Tree alone he bard us from
And charged us never near its shade should come.
For Death is harbou^'d in this Tree, our last
And fatal day is come should we but taste
This tempting fruit: Great pity it is so fair
And lovely Apples should such poison bear.
The subtle Serpent that he might beguile
The better, answered with a forced smile.
Pleasures are hardly left, when that our sense
Confirmed by reason, and experience,
Find them both good, and just: I am too wise,
This Tree in truth has opened mine eyes,
For to beguiled be; Think you to 'fright
Me, with your Bug-bears from my chief delight?
No, you would drive me from my happiness
That you this fair Tree might alone possess.
Say what you will, this Tree nor fruit I fear,
I by experience know no hurt dwells here;
And you know that; Nor I said Eve, nor do
I now dissemble, I the truth to you
Declared have; God charged us not come nigh,
Nor taste this Tree; did we, we sure should dye.
The subtle Serpent thus reanswereth:
And speak you Truth? what this Tree bring you Death?
God charged you thus? And told you you should dye
Did you but taste thereof? I now know why
He made you this believe: Lend me your ear,
I Will banish soon from you this vainer fear,
And let you know that in this Grove there is none
So beautiful, and Good, as is this one.
All what I have, this subtlety, this wit
I must acknowledge that I owe to it,
Which by frequenting of this better Tree,
Has been I know not how inspired in me.
You see more wit, and subtilty I have
Then all the Beasts beside; This Tree this gave;
Which does increase, and whilst I here remain
More wit, and knowledge every day I gain.
Reflect a little; This like the Devil exhibited the forbidden Tree in a most
exquisite dress: for Eve thought it good, and pleasing, with a vain hope of
becoming as God, or else she had never chosen it.
let your eyes but trace
Each Tree that grows in this Celestial place,
Consider all their beauties: look ag'in
And see if any like to this is seen.
Though all are full of Beauty, verdant, fair,
May yet there any with this Tree compare?
This Tree is Mistress of the rest, and Queen
Of this same Grove, none has such verdant green;
See how she in the midst is placed, each tree
Encompasse her, and as her servants ^e,
Bow their proud tops unto her lofty spire;
See how she mounteth than the rest far higher,
And threatens with her waveing tops (well near
Unto the clouds) the rest who shrink for fear
Their humble heads. See what a length extends
Her interwoven Arms, which still befriend
The under-growing grass with pleasing shades:
Look what soft moss her mighty bole invades,
Like to a mantle of green plush, these be
Like Ornaments unto her Majesty,
As Queen of all the rest. Consider, and
Think if that he who this severe Command
Gave unto you, so would his works disgrace
By placing poison in the happiest place:
All things he made are Good; where are your Eyes?
Think you that ill can be in Paradise?
Can this choice Tree so great an ill contain?
Pish! don't believed, for all such thoughts are vain.
No, no, I Will tell you why he did forbid
You to come near this Tree; such virtue's hid
Within its golden Fruit, should you but taste,
You Would be for ever happy, ever blessed;
No longer then in stupid Ignorance
Should you enchained be; then happy glance
From brighter Light, would in your Souls arise:
See then would your blind Soul; and dimmer eyes
Made bright, discern betwixt all good, and ill,
T^anscendant knowledge then your brains would fill,
You should be wise, and like the Gods; this knew
They well, should happen (if you eat) to you:
Therefore they did prohibit you this Tree,
L^st you by eating like themselves should be.
Thus should you dye, fear not such scare-crows now;
See how the glit'ring Fruit does lade each bow:
Look how they are painted with Vermilion dye
Like golden stars set in a verdant Sky,
Or like the blushing Roses, which are seen
New peeping forth through a verdant Screen.
Look how the Apples blush, see how they stand,
See how the boughs, bow down to kiss thine hand;
All Is at thy choice: which on this fair-spread Tree.
(Come tell me Eve!) most liked is by thee?
See here is a fine one, this? or this best likes
Thee? do but look what many pretty strikes
Of red, and yellow paint; here is one that skipps
Unto thy mouth: here thine own Cherry lips
Are answered; thy softer skin thou may
Here find; but there is a mellow one whose taste
So 'T^s p^oba^le that Eve chose Concupiscence which is a fruit of the
forbidden Tr^e, See the f^uits, p. But in whatsoever it was, the eating was but
the breaking off their wills, from the ^ill of Go^ by disob^dience, thereby
aw^k^^ing keeping the wrathful or first Principle of Death, which diffused it
self by this means on the whole world
sweet -- delicious that 'twil ravish quite
Thy looser senses with extreme delight;
Thou have such choice thou know not which to choose:
Come take this on my word, try what accrews
By this: here take it, prithee ea^, and try
If thou a Goddess art not by, and by.
Tempted by these fine words, and that fair Fruit,
Fear holds her Hands, desire prompts her to it,
At last she takes the sugared bait, does eat,
Finds it for the present very pleasing meat,
Now on its pleasing hue her looks she cast,
Then with her tongue the sweeter Liquor taste
She does: mean time her husband passing by
The place she thus attempts. Look here what I
Have got (said she) so fair an Apple, yet
Thou never saw: it is passing pleasing meat,
Melts in my mouth; I wondered much that we
So strictly were forbid this pleasing Tree:
As mortals here we shall not make abode,
I shall a Goddess be, and thou a God;
We shall be wise as they: here eat thou this
I first have proved: me thinks it pleasing is.
Adam invited thus receives the fruit,
And without long delay falls rashly to it.
He that has drunk the juice of Aconite,
Or the lethiferous Henbane, strait his sp'right
Over fired, or too much cooled, a punction feels,
With grievous smarting rage, his body reels,
His eyes grow dim, his senses stupid; stand
The blood does in his Face, nor Feet, nor Hand
Can he scarce wagg; the World turns round: his Head
Grows dizzy, by and by his spirits fled
From his swelled Carcass, dead they leave him: so
These guilty couple 'gan to feel their woe;
Strait operates the Fruit, a shivering cold
Upon their naked Carcasses takes hold,
A sudden tremour shakes their Limbs; their Eyes
Close on a sudden, and dark mists arise,
Mix't with thick vapors before their sight; they found
Themselves amazed: Cast in a kind of stound
The light they had they loose. Some drunken sot
O^'e charged with Wine or Bear, till h' has forgot
To use his reason, a strong drowsinesse
His fume-farc'd Brain, and weakened eyes possess;
Whilst that he is drenched in Lith, and sleeps fast
His fellows for a punishment do cast:
Agreed; they thence him to a Wood do bear,
Pull off his clothes, and naked leave him there
Fast sleeping on the grass: When sleep, the Fume
That did molest his drunken B^ain over come
Had; he awakes, and his unclosing eyes
Rubbs with his hand; he is about to rise
When that he feels himself a cold; he sees
Before his eyes the Skies, and wavering Trees;
Finds that he has no clothes; gets on his feet
And ev'^' object with'amaz'd eyes does greet;
Amazed he stands, wonders how he came there,
Looks still about, views round, and every where,
For to resolve him none he spies; does go
Doubts wh'r he dreams, or is awaked or no:
Now on the ground, now to the skies are hurld
His eyes: Like one dropped from another World
He stands, and knows not what to say, or do:
Just so do stand, and act these guilty two.
They are amazed, they scarcely know the place,
All things do seem now with another Face:
Gods Image shrinks into a cloud, the light
Of that bright Sun obscured is from their sight,
But by and by the Wrath's awakened,
And now they see their eyes are opened:
They know they are naked, see their beastial Form,
They are ashamed of it, they know the harm
They'ave done unto themselves: both Good, and Ill
Indeed they know, that Shun, but this thy will.
Satan rejoices at his victory,
His poison does diffuse immediately
Through their Bodies: now they' ave fading breath,
Bodies to sickness subject, The first Principle was now awakened in them: and
the second or the Image of God was wholly disappeared tho not utterly extinct,
as it is not till Man come to the perfection (or rather imperfection) of being
in highest union with the dark Wo^ld, as is showed, p.
and to Death:
Now they Sol's heat do feel, now Hyems cold*
Which to keep off themselves in leaves they'nfould.
Now have the stars a power over them:
A death they pick may now from every stemm:
The Beasts no longer them obey, if nigh
They come, they dread them, and away they fly.
Fowls use their wings to shun them: Sorrow, Fear,
Anguish, and Trouble, Heaviness, and Care,
Anxiety, Tears, Sighs, and Passions they
Are subject to: Their Bodies made of clay
To all distempers now. This they brought forth
By feeding on the Principle of Wrath.
God does no longer unto them appear
Now as a Father, but a Judge severe:
They tremble at his Voice: behind the Trees
They think themselves from his all-piercing Eyes
To hide. He sees them, and amidst their fears
He thundereth these words into their ears.
You guilty Souls where are you? have you thus
Transgrest? See now how you are like to us!
Ah foolish Adam that were thus befooled
When I before to thee the danger told!
Art thou a God? or thou a goddess Eve?
See how the Serpent did you both deceive!
Now ye are like the Beasts: This banefull fruit
From which I charged you so, has brought you to it.
Thou Eve, with Grief, Pain, Sorrow, Trouble, Care,
And great discomfort, shall thy children bear;
Subject to Adam: and thou Adam get
Thy food shall with hard labor, toil, and sweat.
Cursed is the Earth for this thy folly. Stay
Here thou no longer must: Hence, pack away,
Thou'st lost the pleasures of blessed Paradise,
They are obscured from thy blinded eyes:
Nor may's thou e're return: Purgatory, or the refining or purifying Fire: see
where it stands, page
A flaming Sword
Placed in a Cherubs hand the door does guard.
Thou have endued now mortality;
Go and enjoy this World in misery.
Thus spoke God's Justice; then his Mercy brake
A deeper silence and Adam or the Image of God as he was first created:
him thus bespake.
Where art thou Adam? is that Face of thine
Muffled in Clouds that was so like to mine?
Where art thou? lost! O sad! my Wrath does say
Thou should in this sad case remain for aye.
But Love will mercy show. In Enmity
The Serpent's, and the Woman's seed shall be:
This Love, in mercy to you, will infuse
He shall thy heel, but thou his head shall bruise.
The Gate of Life is shut; lost's thy blessed state,
But Time shall come when it recuperate
Shall be: the Gates of Death broke down, and one
What thou have lost recover shall again.
From Paradise they go, Christ promised, or the opening of the second Principle.
or Paradise
Rather The loss of Paradise was from the Curse, the Curse is nothing, but
Paradise or the second Principle withdrawn or obscured, by the first and third
Principle: it held then, all the four El^ments as it were in Captivity, and in
humanity, but now they bury the second Principle under them,
departs from them: their blinded eyes
Cannot pierce into the holy Element,
Which in this World, as in a prison pent,
Remains. Like to a Tree whose springing sap
Causes the Tree grow green, when to the top
It does ascend; but when unto the root
It goes; how bears the Tree of leaves, and fruit?
There it lies buried, and the Tree seems dead
Till its remounting all begreens her head.
So did the World appear, lost was its grace,
A darker Vail now hid its brighter Face:
Far greater difference this change d^d bring
Then 'twixt cold Winter, and the pleasant Spring.
Or like a burning Torch, which being sat
In The midst of some great Room does dissipate
The darker shades: which by and by immured
In some dark Lanthorn, all the Room's obscured,
And scarce a Ray of brighter Light is seen:
So is the World to what it once has been.
The Devil's That is the first Principle then, brake loose and domineered over
the second in the third (when before the second wholly re^gned and held captive
the first) which proceeded from Adam's lapse, for thereby the Devil gained
power to infuse his virulent Tincture: It Is true, the World partaking of both
Principles at the Creation, the first remained there, but so captivated as it
did not appear: but as a spark raked up in the Ashes: which was blown into a
Flame by Adam's fall which awakened the wrath fire Principle; or as all
passions rest in Man, which are no disturbance to him if they are not awakened
but useful: so the first Principle was useful being in subjection to the
second, and gave a strength and consisting power to the third.
poison is diffused the row all
Things that compose, or circundate this ball.
Both good, and bad together blend: in some
Things more of Good: in others more does come
Of Bad: the Rose has more of Paradise
Then faetid Hemlock, Pinkes, than Margs, or Crise:
The Lamb then Tigers; Apple Trees than Yew:
The Doves than Hawks: Nightshade has less than Rue.
The Devil chose those creatures that were armed
With Teeth, Horns, tallons, claws, that others harmed
By them might be; for had he chose the Dove,
Or Lamb, could they like Hawk, or Lion prove?
Discording Seeds now grow in every thing;
Confusion through all the Earth does spring.
Wrath's Principle does penetrate this Ball,
And what abo^t it is coporeal:
Both good, and ill together mixed are:
All things created, of them have a share.
This ill lay hid before: We poison may
Into our Bodies safely take; allay
The same with other good ingredients
In such, and such a quantity: It rents
The Body else if it superabound:
So this great Orb in pristine state was found.
Or as in Man all Passions hidden lie,
Which none, if not awakened, can descry;
Nor do they hurt him: But awaken those,
The Mind and Body both they discompose.
So dormant lay the wrathful Principle,
As sparks of fire, in ashes wrapped, until
By Adam's fall it was awaked, the same
Hid spark, by Sathan's blown into a flame.
The Planets now forego their wonted Love,
Contrary'ng do in opposition move:
The (...) Aspects; the starry Orbs immense,
Do now receive a naughty influence;
Such to the Earth they give. The Heaven, and she
Now seem to be at deadly enmity:
From her thick vapors, and bad stinks arise,
Which as her darts she sends against the skies.
Sol sucks her moisture forth, with vehement heat
Her parched sides, as with his scourges, beat
He does: And Heaven her flowring Corn, with round
Ice-bullets forces to the very ground.
Syderial blasts, Mildew, and storms he sends;
Then from his window agil ligh^'ning wends:
When that enough he with his Summer scourges
Has beaten her, comes Winter; then with surges
He does bedrench her Face: Contracting cold
Robs her of all her Beauties: very old
She seems, when snows hang dangling on her head:
Chaps which for heat did, now for cold do spread.
Then storms of Rain, and blustering Winds do make
Her Brooks overflow, her Trees, and Mountains quake.
Thus they oppose each other, now the Seas
Beat with the Wind, do threat the very Skies:
Sometimes excurring from his wonted place,
With brinish floods does wash his Sister's Face.
Now Love is lost; no longer unity
But wrath, and hatred among the Creatures be:
The Lamb now fears the Wolf: The Lion tears
The Kid for food: Bees robbed are now by Bears;
They stings receive: The tusked Bore the Cow
Assaults: The tender Dear, and Hares are now
Slain by the Dogs: The mighty Elephant,
Serpents, and the Rhinoceroth supplant:
The harmless yields to those of greater power;
All filled with Ire, each other do devour.
Serpents now stings receive, strong poison Toads,
Reptils, with Reptils, Plants with Plants at odds
Are now: Now death-Hemlock, and Woolf's-Bain hold,
With too much heat this, that with too much cold
Does kill: Now Briars, Nettles, Thorns, and Weeds,
With hurtful Plants, the Earth accursed breeds.
Now Whales eat other Fish: Trout Dace devoures:
Minnows the Perch: The Pike the Rivers scoures:
To catch the smaller Fry: Eeles Gudgions eat;
And them the Herns; Fish now for Fowl are meat:
They too on each another prey: The Kite
On tender Chickens; Hawks on Sparrows light.
Thus Enmity arose; thus wrath, and strife;
And thus each Creature seeks each others life.
And all, or most se^k humane blood to spill,
Because that Man was cause of all their ill. For had not Man fell the
Creatures had remained in love and unity as they were created, but when the
first Principle of wrath was awakened, and diffused it self through out the
world, it also was diffused through out them.
*
All this did spring from the first Principle,
Which opened strait when our first Parents fell:
And thus the World from its first happy state,
To this, we now do see it in, was brought.
But now the Time's at hand, all long to see,
This World again a Paradise shall be:
The Wrath shall be dethroned, the Lamb shall Reign
In purity; when Christ appears again:
O have thy coming Lord! This blessed Day
Let us behold! Lord Jesus have away!
Wrath's mighty Monarch se'ing how he had wrought,
And the whole Orb under his power brought
By Adam's lapse, rejoiced much; and straight
He does his Kingdom's Princes convocate,
With the whole Host of Hell: to whom he thus
Speaks. Princely vassals! Who is like to us?
What power can contend with us? I see
The Light World's strength cannot match our Policy.
This Day brave Princes have I subject made
A World, and Man too by our guiles betrayed.
I need not tell, what you already know,
That I to Love am an Eternal Foe;
So he to Me; or that continual Jarr^
Betwixt us rise, and everlasting wars.
Our Kingdoms opposite you know, Contend
For mastership, which strife shall never end:
We differ in all things, nor shall a Truce
A minutes quietude from Arms produce:
We are as strong as they: I scorn to bow
To him, for I a way have gained how
For to increase our strength: You Kingdoms, and
Whole Worlds shall have now under your Command;
So many vassals shall this Kingdom stuff,
Were not so vast, 'twould scarce be large enough
For to contain them: you great Princes now
I will advise you what you are to do.
The World, and Man which I have gained, I see
By strength, and cunning must preserved be*
You know aspiring Here is meant those fallen Angels, that with Lucifer their
Captain fell into the wrath, and ever since were the chief Princes thereof. See
their fall, page
Princes! you and I
Left Heaven for prying into the unity,
Because we scorned but for to be above
(For why should mighty Wrath give place to) Love?
We left those Orbs, and did them all despise,
And did this mighty Kingdom colonize
Because we would be free; here we Command,
Are Kings; there servants, did obedient stand;
We are grown mighty, and our powers we will try
To make all World's bow to our Majesty,
Our fires Love's Waters shall consume: we will see
Who shall be greatest either I or he.
A World betwixt us not long since was made,
Wrath's essence there as well as Love's was shed.
Ours made Rocks, stones, flints, Mines of Iron, and Lead:
His Rivers, Trees, Air, Gold, and Silver bred:
In ordering (i. e.) The first Princip. which is not simply evil, but as it is
in opposition to the good.
them, there was an higher hand,
Which to conjunction did them both Command,
And strange such opposites should mixed be
In every thing in equal Harmony:
But that The two Essences of the first and second Principles.
Usurper got the upper ground;
And under his our Essence strictly bound,
So that he Lord was, ours a slave, and thus
He thought for aye, to Lord it over us.
O how I raged! O how the fire flew
From my bright eyes; how I shook Hell you knew
Full well, Love, or the second Principle.
But yet no way there was that I
For to release our essence could espy,
I a sworn Foe to Harmony did great
At Heart, to see our essence bound; and fret
Did to behold my mortal Foe to sport
Himself on Earth, and call it his own Court.
Making a Paradise of it; whilst there
I for to set a foot did scarcely dare:
O how I longed for a confusion, and
To have my Essence like to his Command;
To vex me more, and to increase his bliss,
He made a Man for to enjoy all this;
By what I thought would hurt me most of all
Gained I have the Rule of Earth's fair Ball:
No way our Essence to release was left
But by the fall of Man; always to sift
I then began: In Paradise there stood
A Tree, was partly evil, partly good;
This was to Man prohibited; Love knew
If he should eat thereof, what would ensue;
For by that means alone our Essence might
Released be; Loves Essence put to flight.
I then bestir'd my self, and by my guiles
Made them to eat thereof, who poor exiles
Do now repent their fact: their Joy, and Bliss,
And every thing on earth subverted is.
Our essence now does every where appear
And like it self begins to domineer;
Now we will command the Earth; Love's essence scoff:
For I intend you shall be Lords thereof.
Are not we mighty now? who like to us?
Hah! who can match us, when we can do thus?
Our Foe who thought in Earth to captivate
Us, imprisoned is: thus altered is our state!
But let us now provide for the Future: Gain
We may a Kingdom better than maintain
It being got. Our Foe has footing there
Still, who will strive for to regain his share,
And beat us back again; the which he can
Never do, but by redeeming fallen Man.
About him all our strife will be; for Love
Still loves this Man all Creatures else above;
For him I know his Forces he will engage,
Therefore the World must be the fighting stage
For our two Powers: He Would not let us have one
Would Man obey him, or with him Conjoyn.
But we will deal well enough: his Paradise
Now cannot be seen; we will set before Man's eyes
The Earth's vain pleasures, which shall captivate
Him to us; rob him of his future state:
For present Indeed this is the thing if rightly considered the gains Hell so
many M^n: the present and pleasant condition without reflection of hereafter.
Pleasures far more pleasing are
Than those hereafter promised few know where.
We Will have a thousand ways (experience
Shall make you masters in our Arts Commence)
For to beguile poor Man: we will do it tho
We nothing gain by it, to rob our Foe
Of his delights: But Man is mighty great
Without him our Kingdom cannot be complete,
Which is exceeding vast, you know it wants
To fill each corner such inhabitants.
Who most men gain shall, I with Love do vie,
Nor can he Man's Soul Correct more than I.
He without Man cannot his Wonders show,
Nor I without him what my power can do:
Therefore when one you gained have to your lore,
He Will sooner gain to you a thousand more.
But all of you mark this: No Soul does come
In flesh: no Babe springs from its Mothers womb,
But that my Foe a little spark does place
The which he calls his Image, or his Grace,
Within the Center of its Soul. This then
You must endeavor to root out of Men,
And in its place, place mine, for that once gone
He Is perfect with us, and is sure our own.
But if extinguish it you cannot; I say
Smother't with the World's pleasures what you may,
And be you sure it never begins to glow,
For if it does the better gains our Foe.
I know you will be circumspect; therefore
To such free Agents, need I say no more,
But go, and do your work; maintain our might
Within the World, against Love's power fight:
My aid you shall not want.

The Prince of Love, of Light, of Peace, of Truth,
Beholds poor Man, and his sad state with Ruth:
And tho Man's guilt brought down this sad distress,
He Love immense does still to him express:
And lest that mighty Wrath his Soul devour,
He will protect him with his mighty Power.
Heaven's brighter Bands he therefore Convocates,
And thus his Royal Will to them relates.
Blessed Princes of this lighter World! and ye
Vast Troops indu'd with immortality!
Know; Man for whom a Paradise we made,
By his own folly is to Wrath betrayed.
He has deserted us: this happy Realm
Has lost; now misery does overwhelm
Him; and our Image in obscurity
Does buried by the World's gross Spirit lie.
Wrath's Principle has poisoned the Earth,
Spoiled Paradise with his infectious Breath:
He now triumphs. But what lose we? it is Man
That suffers most for his own folly, then
Shall we desert him? leave him to his Foe?
Strict Justice might, but Love cannot do so^
Can fire cool? or can cold Water burn?
No more can I from this my nature turn:
Nor his neglect, nor his strange follies move
May me to Wrath. O no! I still am Love.
My nature cannot change: I pity have;
I must, I will endeavor Man to save.
So long as he my Image does retain,
Although obscured; ^le seek him to regain
To me, and that immortal spark divine,
Shall like the Sun in its fair splendour shine.
Can I the Principle of Wrath dethrone
Out of his heart, and th'out Worlds, he is my own.
Wrath's Principle although he triumphs now,
One day again shall to our Powers bow:
The Earth a Paradise shall be, and then
All things shall turn to Harmony again:
My Foe shall then be captivate: Man shall
Most happy live upon the outward Ball.
Six A thousand years are as one day in the computation of God: so that
probably this may come to pass in the age of the world 7000. Which will be
completed in the year of Christ 2051. which is 394. years hence: so Christ's
cocoming into the world in flesh will be about the midst between man's Creation,
and his restoration into that Paradisical state he had lost: Then it is like
the Sabbath of rest shall be until the con^lagration of the world. But we may
not determine any thing concerning this, for it may be sooner, for Christ
promised that the d^yes should be shortened for the Elects sake. The time none
knows, but all expect. Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.

Guard thou his health; divert the fatal knife,
And keep off all attempts against his life.

For what if one should with a sword, in Wrath

From some high Rock? What? should I guilty be,
Unless that I with my free will had gone,
And voluntary sought destruction?
Sinn's not without assent: Nor lies it in
B'ing tempted, but in yielding lies the sin.
^s God so hard to punish us, think you,
For sin if we no otherwise can do?
Have we no power to will the good? O fad!
If God should punish if we will the bad.
And yet you see most wills seem captivate
To ill: in this we are like an Infant, that
Chooses some baubl^ when a Jewel too
With it exposed, was to his choice and view:
He Is not constrained, he choose may which he will:
So we through ignorance often choose the ill.
Man's will is free. Both Words strive with their might,
For this their powers so eagerly do fight.

In this there are degrees: coaction may
Befall me, when my Will another way
Propends: like one who to the place does go
Where he must executed be: ye know,
Without his will his body would not move,
And yet that thing he wills he does not love:
His will's yet free, that cannot be forced: refuse
He cannot Death, yet it he does not choose.
So often times to Man it may befall,
That he may do what he not wills at all.
M^n wills not wholly ill, until that he

Thus Hell prevailed until the Prince of Love

He gave to Hell; who tues that fatal blow:
For since that time Loves banners were displayed
Th'rowout the O^b; Hells strength and force decayed.
Whilst thus these powers for man contend, and be
In sharpest Wars; upon the mortal tree
Man lives, his food which to his palate suits
Best, are its various and delicious fruits.
This is the Tree of Good and Evil: for
The Fruits themselves though good, nor evil are,
Yet (as the Plannet Mercury) incline
To either, as they are to whom they join.
It Is not the grosser part that feeds thereon,
But it is the soul, the highest part of man.
The flesh has fleshly food; the soul likewise
Feeds, but on choice and more varieties.
This Tree is good for To us mortals, nor is it the forb^dden tree to us, only
the evil part thereof which st^^deth in the wrath of God, and in the first
principle. But Adam was in Paradise without this mo^al terrestrial body, and
was not to have put his imagination into the earthly nature at all, nor to have
desired after the fruits of this Tree, but to have known all things in that
principle in which be stood, and to have held both this and the first in
subjection under him: This now cannot be performed by us wholly, so long as
these bodies remain, for we cannot maintain our bodies without the fruit of
this Tree, now is the fruit evil of it self, but may serve us for the better
glorification of the Al^^^ghty.
food; such choice of fruits
It has, that it conveniently suits
With every soul; so large and fairly spread
That with its branches East, and West are wed.
These then the fruits are. Here hangs natural Wit,
And Judgment, which humane affairs does fit.
Here a propriety in goods, and Lands,
Self Interest; Love to relations hangs
On this Bow; here an innate doing right
P^nds; here hangs Riches, you' unto the sight
Appears the lovely fruit of Beauty; there
Spo^ts to refresh the mind, and Body are.
Here Honou^s hang, and high promotions;
Plenty of Goods, and great possessions.
Here dangles Pleasures, here Morality,
Good Carriage, Parts, and civil honesty.
Degrees of State, whence Kings, and Lords arise,
Earls, Barrons, Knights, Gentry, Nobilities:
Here Power, and Authority; and here
This Bow innate Concupiscence does bear.
On the other side all manual Arts, and Trades,
In clusters hang, among the greener shades,
Here you may find both Grammar, Rhetoric,
With Logic, optics, and A^tl^etic:
Music, Physics, Metaphysics too,
With Geometry hang dangling in your view;
Astronomy, and Geography there,
Astr^logie, and Surgery appear.
Here natural Magic; and Theology,
Accompan'ed with antique Poetry;
Here Chimistry, Ethics, oeconomicks,
Phisosophy all sorts, and Politics,
With many more do grow. This is the food
Which Man's Soul eats, and finds it very good.
If that you well revolve these in your mind.
Nor Good, nor Bad them in themselves you will find;
Yet may to^poyson be converted, or
Made wholesome nourishment convenient for
Man's soaring Soul. Here the two opposite
Worlds forces often meet, and strongly fight.
Both would his Cooks be, both desire to carve,
Both willingly would at his Table serve,
That they their Tinctures might infuse; for meats
Do operate much in his Soul that eats,
For Beauty (which a pleasant harmony
Of Blood, and humors is, just symmetry
Of all the parts) no evil is: nor is it
A sin to have it, or a sin to mist't:
Yet Satan this to poison may convert,
If through it he should elate the heart;
Make those that it possess, make it nothing worth
By spending precious Time to set it forth.
Satan endeavors through it to cause
Pride, and to make them greedy of applause,
To dress it forth with highest vanities:
To make adorers with their wanton eyes:
Then Lust creeps in, with other sins; and thus
Beauty though good is evil made to us.
Loves Forces strive if thou have Beauty, to
Make it most wholesome, and good food for you:
He Would make thee Chaste, and strive his Grace to set,
As Jewels in so fair a Cabinet.
Virtue shines brightest in a beauteous frame,
That graceth Beauty: Beauty to the same
Adds splendour. Often the Beauty of the Soul
Is disregarded in a Face that is foul.
Therefore if thou art beautiful, thou art
More fit to serve God with a purer heart;
For is it not fit that he who Beauty gave,
Before all others should thy Beauty have?
Thus pleads Love, who'd make it good; and thus
It may be made both Good, and ill to us.
To ill the Devil would convert thy Wit,
And understanding, by employing it
In vanities, or some ill Arts, or by
Converting it to guile, or subtilty.
Loves power would draw it unto goodness, and
His sacred Mysteries to understand
Cause, by converting it to Wisdom; so
Wit may our Friend be, or may be our Foe.
All Arts and Sciences may be abused,
Made Good if rightly, Bad if wrongly used.
So natural knowledge us indammage may,
But do great good if it we well employ.
So whilst that we inspect Astrology,
Or the stars motions by Astronomy
View; we may there Gods Wonders contemplate,
Which may to Earth our eager Love abate:
Whilst we in Natural Magic look, and see
The various Wonders that there hidden be.
We may with greater ardour praise his Name,
Who out of nothing, thus all things did frame.
Thus it redound may to God's glory: But
It by temptation we do solely put
Our minds therein, or greater things neglect
For them, or to the stars an indirect
Power ascribe; or natural Magic pass
To necromancy, or Hells arts, alas!
How are we lost! thus recreat^ons
May help the mind; or prove temptations
To greater ills. Thus Logic may be bent
For to maintain Errors by Argument,
And Syllogisms, when the Truth it should
Alone maintain: Thus bad it proves: Thus good.
So Rhetoric with all its figures may
A false cause to Truth's prejudice display.
What may do greater good, than may the Tongue?
And yet what is there that does greater wrong?
So Eloquence which should to heaven invite,
By Satan's means does unto Hell excite.
How good a fruit's divine Theology!
Yet it by Satan may corrupted be:
How many Errors, Schisms, Heresies,
Strange Fancies, Whimsies, horrid Blasphemies
Has sprung from those who thus have studied, by
Our Adversarie's subtle ingeny
Caused! Music Satan does impoyson too,
And makes more hurt, than good by it accrue
To most; for those, whose minds he does possesle,
It stirs to Lust, provokes to wantonness:
Allures to riot, and to vanity^
Thus is it the fruit made of the evil Tree.
When that it should (so minds to Heaven erect
Do find it) unto happiness direct
Our fleeting thoughts, and by those warbling measures
Ravish our souls from earth, to Heavens pleasures:
Make us to enter contemplation
Of those sweet voices, which before the Throne
Sing evermore with Halalujahs; raise
Our duller spirits; and make us sing with praise
Heaven's mercies to us; and above the poles
Divinely carry our harmonious souls;
Where in a kind of ecstasy, a bliss
Not to be spoke they find. Thus good it is.
And now my heart glows with a sacred fire,
Just is my zeal, nor sinful is my ire,
Against those vitiators who in these our times
Make Poesy hateful, by their wanton rithmes;
Who feel no sacred, glowing heats; who prize
No flames, but what come from their Mistress' eyes.
Leave off you looser rithmers, cease your pains,
For shame, and trouble shall be all your gains.
Abuse no longer what in times of old
God has himself made use of to unfold
His sacred Mysteries, nor let it be
Made by you thus fruit of the evil Tree.
Luxurious wits who feed on Poetry
Are thus by subtle Satan drawn awry,
Whilst they the cream of wit do spend, to grace
With Eulogies some disproportioned face.
Let these low lines you witty ones excite
Your ready quills, on some such theme to write,
Then shall mine cede to yours: not while you err
And mortal beauties do to heaven prefer
The end of Poesy is the praise of God,
Used to that end it is exceeding good.
The food of man's soul thus described you see,
The fruits are of the the good and evil Tree,
Which may be made, or good, or bad or so
Bring Man to bliss, or everlasting woe.
Therefore take heed to Satan's subtle train,
That by these fruits thy soul he may not gain,
For here he shows his cunning, and his skill,
To make thee, only feed upon the ill.
Heaven's forces strive, and if thou will obey,
This Tree shall be the Tree of good, and joy:
And since we must upon it feed we should
Eschew the Evil, and accept the Good.
The subtle Serpent, our sworn foe, with his
Vast Troops, do use to keep us from our bliss
A thousand ways: a thousand stratagems
And tricks he ha^^: he round about behemms
Our yielding (...); and (...) about he sets
To catch us ^^st, his strong, and wide spread nets:
Hel's Troops like Ants do never idle stand.
But mov^ about Earth's mighty Moles, and
All ways to gain the So^l of Man to t^y;
Which got they straight send to Hel's Treasury.
Sometimes he this makes use of, sometimes that,
This serves for this that for another Plot.
Sometimes the Stars, and their ^ad in^luence
As instru^ents he uses: and from whence
He often assaults poor Man. MARS stirs to wrath,
And blood, S^^T^R to Ava^ice, and sloth:
MERC'RIE to Theft: Ambition JUPITER,
VENUS to Lust, and the cold MOON, to err.
His ways innumerable are, and mount
Unto infinity; the stars you count
May first, or sands that on the shore do lie.
He Will suit all Humors: By their humors try
To work for his advantage. To excess
Of feeding this man, that to drunkenness,
He does provoke. Leads this to Pride; to Lust
Another: this to doing things unjust
To lying, Theft, Ad^ltery, Perjury,
And to all manner of iniquity.
But meets he with a studious Man, or one
Who has got conquest over his passion,
Unto gross sins he does not tempt them, he
Their strength does know; therefore with policy
His shape he changes, and with subtle guile
Corrupts their knowledge; and with errors vile
Their Brains does fill: if in Theology
Their study be; their errors are more high.
A prying mind finds he in men of Parts,
He subtlely draws them to his blacker Arts,
Where with most strange delusions them delude
And thus himself in every one intrude
He will; and suting to their inclination
With cunning Art, unseen work their destruction.
But sees (...) some who in earnest be
To leav^ the World, who would their Spirits free
From his sad bondage, bid this Earth adieu,
And wo^ld with Heaven a stricter league renew:
Uprightly walk, and very closely press
To find that Gate that leads to happiness,
Out of this Earth; thus cunningly be deals,
So soon as he their working pulses feels.
A mighty Circle before the gate he draws,
The which scarce touched is with Heaven's Rays:
Those then who pres^e toward this Gate, anon

For so it is they in a Circle run,
Blinded, and groping, wanting heat, and Sun.
A little Light, as at a crevice flows

Words, Literal sense, Disputes, and Cavilment,

Self-gathering in a more righteous Band.
With these they sport themselves, who (like that fire

Alas! though some do almost touch it, yet
Through blindness they can have no power to see it.
The way's not Sects, nor forms of pleasing sense,
But Truth, and Life, to Christ obedience.
Tho Satan tempts all men unto sin,
And does desire they should inhabit in

He trys* as by this worlds law pleasures, yet
He Would rather man should like a Prince be set
Then like a slave in his great Kingdom; there
Both high and low degrees of places are:
They nearer to, or farther from his Throne
Are set, as they with him have union.
Those whom this worlds low pleasures catch, or those
Who by Lust, Lying, Wrath, or Envy goes
To this dark world; are kind of underlings,
And are like Subjects to Hells greater Kings.
But those who to greater perfection
Arrive, and who have stricter union
With Hell; and those who knew his M^gic's might
Advan^'d are, and their states are higher pight.
These do become P^inces in Wrath, and these
He loves most; for they his nature please,
Are one with him; these do his Wonders show
And make his mighty power known below.
These are his Agents, Saints, beloved ones,
Are more than servants: these become his Sona.

Elder Brother show
His Magic first shall on this Earth below.
Therefore it first I will describe, and tell,
The Power, Nature, Might, and Pomp of Hell.
Mundus tenebros^s vel tartareus.
SUppose the mighty Prince of darkness would
Himself incarnate, vail with with fleshly Hood
His Stygian Face; to show the power, and might
Of the vast Kingdom of Aeternal Night,
Upon this Earth: He finds a man propense
From genial stars to ill; a mind immense
After abstruser prying; piercing Wit
Grave look and studious; such a Man is fit
For this his high design. First then he strait
Causes his Princes on his elbow wait,
With all Hel's agents, who in clusters press
TO imbue his Soul with deep died wickedness,
By their infernal Magic; they convert
The mortal Tree's fruit to the Evil part.
He feeds on ill, the which his Soul does stain;
His freer will unto themselves they gain:
And by degrees, his senses please, that he
Desires they should his Companions be.
They promise then if he will obedient
Be; with what power, and Regiment
They will indue him, His high mind does come,
And Hel's disciple does at last become.
Some Angel then Hel's mighty Prince assigns
To wait on him; he good converse declines:
The Demons laugh to see him captivate,
And sco^f the Angels of the other state.
Seeing that he obedient is, they now
Cause him unto Hel's Image for to bow:
And as the ^^^nce of Heaven commands his
A way to gain, the same, to shun Heavens bliss
Hel's Prince commands. He from the World abstract
Must be, lest that his deeper thoughts detract
From that high work he does intend him for:
He fastings, vig^^s, does command him; nor
Less prayers than the other World requires,
Washings, and Ceremoies he desires
And also that he should be Celebate,
Thus like an Ape he God does imitate
In all his biddings, th'better to beguile
Man, with his high deceits, and cunning vile.
He spares him in gross sins, it may be too,
Lest they with pinguitude his Soul imbue,
And make's less apt to search those hidden arts,
Which Hell to his obedient ones imparts.
But if he in them Master will Commence,
He must attain it by obedience
To whatsoever Hell commands; for he
Must gain the Will, then act by sympathy.
He now it may be for some years has served
This Principle, nor from his Laws has swerved
But still obedient been: nor his desire
Thereto does slack, implete with hellish fire.
His serving D^emon still attending too,
With Stygian vigor does his heart imbue:
Pleases his fancy with some stranger art,
Hels sacramental Mys^eries impart
He does; till at the last he does bequeath
To him the fruits of the black Tree of Death.
Rough hairy Satyrs with their cloven feet
And staring eyes if that a stranger meet
Should all alone in some dark Wood and night,
How pitifully would they him affright ^
Or any other ill-shap'd monster, yet
A f^equent sight no wonder would beger*
And should such Satyrs often be with him,
No whit at all affrightful would they seem.
So those dark Spirits apparitions might,
Man's weaker senses at the first affright.
But after some familiarity
No fear at all would be; especially
To those whose natures, as their natures be,
In a strict league with Hell; and would be such
Did not their Souls in a fleshed body couch.
Toads are not venomous to Toads; nor is
The Lion truculent to those of his
Kind; nor are Monsters frightful unto theirs:
Satyrs to Satyrs, not are Bears to Bears:
So Man whose Soul's drenched in the Stygian pool;
Thinks not Hel's worst deformed spiri^s soul.
And this they know, or else I do suppose
They Would not so bo^dly their strange shap^s disclose.
Hel's mighty Prince sees now his servant ^it
To see his Kingdoms pomp: he does commit
The charge thereof to some great Prince, who goes
To him, and thus his message does disclose.
Hel's mighty Monarch, Prince of Acher^n;
Great Duke of Styx, Primate of Phlegiton,
Of Lethe Earl, great Lord of Cocy^^^,
of deep Avernus, Orcus, E^ebus,
And of the whole dark world; best part of this
Gained by his forces, and now joined to his;
My sovereign Liege, has sent me unto you
His faithful servant, with his leave to show
Our Kingdom's glory, whereby you may see
That you do serve no petty Majesty.
Our high and mighty Prince, has had regard
To all your services, he now reward
Will your fidelity: he Crowns, and thrones
As well as LOVE has for his faithful ones.
A Throne, and Crown he has prepared for thee,
And of our Kingdom thou a Peer shall be,
When thou this Body shall put off, and set
Thy Soul at liberty, which now does let
Perfect enjoyment: In the mean time tho,
This favour's granted, that I thee may show
Our pomp, and Glory: art thou willing* say!
To whom Hel's servant thus without delay.
Great Prince and servant to our sovereign King.
What joyful news is this that you do bring!
I scarce contain my Soul. What? shall I see
The glory of his Stygian Majesty
Ever I depart this World? this favor would
More strictly bind me his, and if I could
Be more his than I am: what in this Ball
I have, I willing am to part withal
To purchase this: Love's great inticements, I
Abhor, and do spontaneously deny.
Come let us go, I burn with strong desire,
For to be in, and see this Orb of Fire.
Hel's Nuncio thus speaks. Valiant heart, delay
I will not: thou thy hearts desire enjoy
Shall; and when thou hither returnest, then
Thou shall be Hel's highest Magitian;
Such gifts we will bestow: and thou shall see
Before thou back returnst, what Gifts they be.
Your staff is needless: nor your Horse-you need,
For I am able to make greater speed,
For whilst that you can ride a League, as soon
I can be mounted higher than the Moon:
I can transport your Corpse, no need of that
There is, at this time; for our Journey's not
So great; only make fast your Closer door
That none may enter to disturb you: for
Your Body here shall lie: Then shall you see,
How nimble Spirits without Bodies be.
You miss it shall not for you will think you bear
It still, but feel it lighter than the Air.
Alas! that is a prison to the Soul,
She free from that, is then without control;
Nor could that bear indeed, what you will feel
Be'ing made of flesh, nay were it made of steel
It could not, 'twould consumed be: your sp'rit
Can bear the punctions of eternal Night,
Being in union with us, and may pass
Into our Kingdom; for your Nature as
Ours is, your senses will be open too,
You Will think you see, feel, hear, as now you do.
But why do I forestal you thus? Delay
I will no longer: Come I Will lead the way.
This spied: his hand upon his eyes he lay's,
To which Ethaean stupor he conveighs;
Down falls his Carcasle like a Trunck bereft
Of Life; no sense is in his Body left:
His Spirit's fled, and by Hel's Fiend is brought
Into that Kingdom, swi^ter than a Thought.
Thus then he felt himself. He was like one
Who in his sleep sees some strange Vision.
And dreams himself awake; but yet does find
Some kind of misty A^oms, which do blind
His sight from a clear view. He thus at first
Did find himself, until he farther thrust
Was from's attractive Corpse: He nimbly than
And with a clearer sight to mount began.
Thus then his Jornal was. Nor Moon, nor Sun,
Nor any other Star upon him shon;
But yet not quite of Light devoy'd, he had
Such as wherewith a misty ev'ning's clad,
A kind of twylight: Earth, nor raging Seas,
Nor any thing but misty air he sees.
A circling Cloud darker then pitch appears,
Vast, and of huge extent; aloft it rears
In forms of Cliffs, and pointed Rocks. The Sp'rite
Thus speaks: these pitchy, cloudy mounts in sight,

walled.
This is the Entry. Here involved lies
Continual Light, none there a Ray espies
Of any Light: part of this Rock God threw
In It Egypt, when that thicker darkness flew
The Row out the Land; our dearest servants he
With our own weapons plagues continually.
It Is not so dark within the pale: now this
Is caused by Antiperistasis:
And that cold Region which ingendreth hail,
And thunder (which when Icy clouds assail
Each other's made) becomes so violent
From two contraries, which from both sides sent,
Causes its forces shrink together; so
More violent, pent in less room they grow.
This darkness then flies from that Light within,
And from the Light Wo^ld's shine; so lies between,
Shrouding together, pressing close, and thick,
Fast cleaving, closely does together stick.
These palpable dark clouds they enter; where
He does a thousand shrecks, and howlings hear,
Cursings, Blasphemings, swearing, murmuring voyc^^,
Bellowing, with a thousand ugly noyses;
But horrid darkness so encompas'd him
That who these noyses made could not be seen;
Besides an ugly filthy stink he simelt,
An horrid taste clove to his tongue; he felt
The dark clouds press upon him. The Row they pass
And with swift steps leave this abhorred place.
B'ing past his truchman thus. What you did hear
Caused was by Spirits that inhabit there,
Who spo^ting were together: Teter haggs
In the outward World feed these with shri^'led baggs,
The which they suck, There dwell the Incubi,
And Succubi; deformed Spirits lie
By millions there; those who desire to feed
On humane morsels; such who shed their seed
Into old Haggs: I^ regard that th^^ ^orld being outermost is also lowermost.
See page
and these are those which they
Call down to their assistance; these obey
To ^e^er charms, ointments, persumes, and these
Appear to them in various shapes; and please
Them with their antic Tricks: make hoggs to dance
On hinder feet, platters to skip, and prance,
With such like sports; make Cows, and Cattle languish,
And mortal men strike too with pain, and anguish:
And these old haggs command, unless they are
By the other World resisted, then they dare
Not do it. These are our slaves, we them command,
And when we need them on our ^rrands send.
In these the old Haggs delight, for often they
(Such power they have) their Bodies do conveigh
From place, to place; and often meet theirsp'rights,
Their Bodies left: where fed with gross delights,
They back return: These are our Prince's slaves
Who bring him many Souls, when that the graves
Their Bodies take: But often times these do fly,
And tear in pieces as in sportful play
Those whom they served, when that their date is out^
Now we are Princes, and alas but flout
Those powting Witches, when with charms they think
To call us downt' obey their drei^y wink.
No, we stir not, but when our mighty Prince
Imposes his Commands; then wend we hence
Into the World. When that you do return
These Sp'rites you heard shall all obey your charm;
Nay we; and if our Prince that power gives,
But yet that power has no man that lives:
For to call down, an Angel of his Throne,
He first with him must have high union.
Still on they pass? upon the right hand^stood
Oblivious Lethe, 'bout whose s^ow-pac'd flood
Lay many sleepy Sp'rit^, whose office was,
From that place to the outer World to pass,
With Pitchers full of that same Water; by
Which, they brought Souls into a Lethargy;
And kind of stupor, lest the s^ark of Love,
Whose nature's ag^l' should with Life remove
Their Syncopy to goodness. On the other side
About dark Erebus, as many 'bide.
There did, who those Erebean waves did bear
Into the Earth; which they to Souls did share
With liberal dole: the which no sooner taken,
But darkness, and obscurity remain
There dos upon their souls, which does remove
The glowing spark of the bright Light of Love.
Further they pass, until or last they come
Unto the joylesse extremes of Acheron:
Here he beheld many a naked soul
Drenched in those waves by Spirits black, and foul,
Their Faces sad, and heavy, melancholic;
(Nor were those Spirits there so brisk, and frollick
As those in other places, which it seems
Caused by the operation of these streams
Was) formed like Death; Despair sat in their eyes,
And every moment caused new miseries.
Others apace did thence that water bear
Into the Earth, which caused sad despair,
To souls that ^ast thereof. Who pass this stream
Their Bodies dead, none may their souls redeem.
Over that stream they pass; when that he hears
Sad Lamentations, for the Vale of Tears
They entered had: sliding along the Vale
Cocytus ran; upon whose banks did wail
With lamentations sad, whole troops of Souls,
A stream of Tears into the River rouls
From their sad eyes: Before their faces hung
Tabl^ts of bra^^e, where all that they had done
In their lifetime was wrote, which now renewed
Their sorrow. This Spectacle being viewed
They fur^ er pass, where scummy Orcus ran
W^^h ^aetid waves from the cold Stygian
Lake: about whose most horrid banks he spied
All sorts of evil Beasts: The Stygian guide
Thus spoke:
S^cst thou those mighty Herds, these are
The Souls of Men, who did these natures bear
When they were on the Earth. Yond' herd of Swine
Were greedy Gluttons, who with Beer, and Wine
And all the dainties that the Earth did yield
Four times a day their greedy paunches filled:
Their belly was their God, such natures then
They had, which here they have and shall retain.
Yond' herd of Goats were lustful persons: those
Grim Currs were such who ever would oppose
Love's Reign, and Kingdom, snappish, greedy: and
Such as were lawless Lords: that grim-look'd band
Of Lions: Those rough Bears were such, who still
Dispoyl'd their Neighbors: such who rob, and pill
With subtilty, those wilely Foxes were:
Such as were envious speckled Toads now are:
The Avaritious Tigers, Monsters, Dogs; too long
'Twill be for to rehearse that numerous throng,
But crawling worms, Vipers, all ugly Creatures
Are such who once exactly bore their natures
In h^mane shapes, which now these forms retain
And in this guise for ever shall remain.
This said they pass along: Their way they take
Directly now unto the Stygian Lake.
The Pool appears in sight, an horrid stink
Invades his nostrils, ever he gains the brink,
Like f^etid sut mixed with sulphurian fumes:
The slow-pac't Wat^^ moves with Icy scumms,
Upon its surface; than the brumal snow
Far colde^ it is: upon its banks did grow
Taxi with sable leaves: darker than ink
Or blackest pitch the water was, the brink
Died was with sable hew: the froery scum
Left black impressions on the bank: a fume
More dark than Night in curling clouds arose:
The strongest poison that on Earth's Orbs grows
Is not by the tenth part so strong as that
Cold-icy stream: thousand of Souls there sat
Shivering for cold, when strait a Troop appears
Of h^rrid Devils, with long flagging Ears
Down to their shoulders, saucer eyes, and lips
Of mighty magnitude, like souced tripes
Hung lower than their chins: their snaky hairs
Hung over their cornuted fronts: like Bears
Their feet, and arms were; their cruented paws
Were armed with bristles, and advanced claws:
With these they gripe those naked Souls, then on
Their shoulders hoyst them, and away they run.
Come let us follow: these the torments are
The damned for ever, and for ever bear,
In this same place, thus said the guiding Fiend:
With hasty steps, as fast as they, they wend,
When presently they are arrived upon
The burning Banks of fiery Pl^geton.
In here they souse them: Cries, and shrecks they make,
But hard-heart Devils can no pity take:
Over, and over here they plunge them, then
To cold-stream'd Styx they bear them back again,
And thus by turns these torments, with delight
They give, without a moment of respite.
Swi^^er than Tygris, or ^anub^^, this
Tartarean River runs, far hotter is
Than boiling Liquor; here it bubbles, Fumes
Which turn to Flame, flow from its Sulph'ry wombs:
The banks are licked by Living flames, from out^
Of gapeing chincks both fire, and brimstone spout.
This seen they further pass; not far from this
Was Tartarus, within his huge Abyss,^
He looked and saw nothing but horrid, dark,
Obnigrous clouds: heard Wolves, and Dogs to bark.
Lions, and Tigers roar; men shreech, and wail,
Others Blaspheme, and others Curse, and rail
Against Heaven, a strange confused noise: He smelt
Most horrid stinks: and cold damp vapors felt.
Srait ways huge fires appeared below, whereby
He might the Souls tormented there descry:
All sorts of torments that you can devise
With all the plagues, and all the Miseries
You can imagine he inflicted saw,
Upon those miserable Souls below.
Some torn with wheels, some with hot Tongs, their tongues
Pulled out; and some with scalding flames their Lungs
Washed were, and others in the fire hung
From whence they into f^ozen Rivers flung
Were by and by: and others whip't with steel:
Others on Gridirons brent, whilst others feel
The smart of Salt, and Vin^ger, which laid
Is on their tender flesh, be'ing newly flead:
With diverse other sorts of torments: then
From this deep pit of Hell they farther wen.
Now far they were not gone from Tartarus
When in this sort spoke Hel's mystag^gus.
Whilst we proceed to our Kingdoms Center, where
Our mighty King his Court does keep, declare
I will, our Kingdom's first original,
When we came first into this ^^ery Ball;
For do not think that ignorant we be
Of our beginning, and high pedigree,
Or that we have no memory of what
We once enjoyed: no more then Souls forget
What they in Earth have done, when they come here,
For all their deeds Eternal forms do b^ar
Which here remain; and which torments them more
Than in cold Styx for to be plunged over:
Ah! Could but Souls in Lethe drenched be,
How little would they feel of misery!
But this a favor is which now I show,
And should be granted unto none but you.
Know then there is a God, and this although
We tremble at it, we assur'dly know;
Yet that there is none we of^entimes suggest
Unto the misbelieving Atheist.

It Is not against this Power that we ^ear,
And rend, and fight, and so opposing are,

In Wrath, and bitterness, and natural
It is for us to fight against that Ball.
As fire cannot but tend upwards, so cannot we
But to that Orb perpetual Enmity
Bear: That to us has an Antipathy.
Think not that God in Wrath did us create,
Or that for damned Souls he made this state,
For to torment them in: He did not Will
That there a Hell should be: or any ill.
Thus then it came. God from Aeternity
Did generate two Principles, which be
Contrary to each other. God alone
Cannot (but by these Principles) be known.
These generate he did Aeternally,
Both in, and by himself, a mystery
Not to be comprehended. Neither tho

Ranters fell into that erroneous notion of all things proceeding from God,
as well the evil as the good, and that they served him in all manner of
wickedness and sins, as well as in uprightness and Love, seeing he was the
Author of all. Indeed they ferv'd the first Principle, and unl^sse they repent
may therein serve to Aeternity.
Root from whence they flow:
This Principle in which we make abode
Is called the first: An ang'^y, zealous God
And full of Wrath, Vengeance, and Ire, here
To mortal Men, and us he does appear.
In the other Principle of Love, and Light,
To men he does appear quite opposite:
The nature of our The first Principle described.
Principle is this,
It full of raging, anxious prickling is,
An harsh, sour, tart, fell, ^ager essence, and
Of bitterness, and stinging full; we stand
In this. The other Principle is quite
An other nature, to this opposite,
We know no more of that: this I can tell
That accidentally is the For Hell is the privation of Heaven, and were there
no joy, ease, and pleasure, there could be ^now^ no sorrow, pain, and T^rment:
Should the second Principle shed ^t self through out the first, that would also
become Heaven, so the absence of that, causes Hell.
cause of Hell.
Proceeding still they now were come upon
The entrance to Hel's inmost Region;
A vast huge Globe of sad dark glowing Fire
He saw, and in it thousand Devils, nigher
He fears to go: which seen thus said the Fiend,
What now? afraid? what is the matter Friend;
You do forget you have no body on
Your Spirit's here, and Spirits cannot burn.
With this you must be clothed; in this we dwell,
And so must you: This is the fire of Hell.
Which never can go out: don't you admire
What fuel it is maintains so great a fire?
Come, ever we farther go I will explain
Its cause, and nature in a word, or twain.
This Principle of Wrath; of which I spoke
Even now, God ne'^ intended to awake,
For it recluded was; he did not will
It should be open, nor that so much ill
Should happen. Now before your lower Sphere
Had birth, or being, we created were:
Our mighty Prince, King Lucifer was then
Created of such stuff, as Souls of Men
Created are, and we his servants true,
Caelestial Forms, at that time did indue.
Our Prince more bright, than your light-giving Sun
In glorious Rays of Heavn'ly Light out-shon
All other Angels, sat upon the Throne
Of God, and like a God himself did reign.
Out of both Principles composed we were,
As Man's Soul is; and other Angels are:
The first recluded was, and we were made ^
In The second, there we should for aye have stayed:
But our brave Prince (I must commend him for it)
Did bravely Lord it in a Kingly sort
Over the heart of God; that meekness scorned,
Did higher fly, and his high Spirit turned
Into the fiery property; that Rage
And fiery flash which Love could not assuage
He there begat. We as our Master did,
Raged as he; and so defiance bid
To Love, and Meekness, and those Angels that
With no aspiring Spirits kept their state.
Thus we deserted with our Prince that Throne
Of Light, and Love, and gained this fiery one,
Where we are potent, and with that strong might
Against Mic^^^^ our adversary fight.
Now those bright Rays which our brave Prince had on
Before with courage high he lef^ that Throne,
As scorning to adorn his Princely grace
With ought that did belong unto that place,
He left behind; The ^all of Lucifer with his Angels.
with that fine form which he
There had: now in the fiery property
We other forms have got, which we can change
Into all sorts of shapes, and Figures strange.
In that great r^ge, and burning of the Wrath,
This fire you see we live in then h^rst forth,
Which from our selves proceeds, and which is made
By that strong enmity which does invade
Us, against the ^^verse Orb of Light: and know
This Fire does from bitter harssinesse grow;
As when you rub your f^int upon a wheel
Which turns round, and is composed of Steel,
You see from bitter grating Fires proceed,
So our harsh grating Spirits Fire breed,
Which is the same you see; This is the pain
That we, and all the damned in remain,
For all those torments that I showed you were
But Images, the better to declare
The nature of this one, and yet alas
This does all them a thousand times surpass.
Spirits alas! though sensible, cannot feel
Material Fire, or jerkes from whips of Steel;
Nor water-torments; it is an aching smart,
Most cruel, sour, eager, fierce, and tart,
Astringent, cold, attracting, harsh desire
Which breeds a piercing, prickling, stinging fire;
Which turns to rage, and enmity, and that
Stirs up the prickling, if it grows flat,
So feeds with fuel: like a turning wheel
It still runs round: These are the pains we feel.
Suppose that one who has a strong desire,
Which burns in him, and he is all on fire
For to ascend a Mountain made of Glass,
The which he knows impossible: alas!
He yet to do it strives; and yet despairs,
He has no hope, and yet desires, nor dares
To think he can; yet trys, he sees it is vain
Yet he desires, and yet he cannot refrain:
Again he tries, he cannot set his feet
But down he slides; this anguish does bege^,
That rage, and fury; then desire again
Renews the anguish, Anguish rage, that pain
Begets, and thus himself his torment breeds:
So here our torment from our selves proceeds,
The which Eternal is. The damned Crew
And we our torments daily thus renew,
A strong desire we do here retain
(The which is mixed with Anguish, Grief, and pain)
After the Heart of God, not that we would
Possess it, or dwell in it if we could,
We cannot have such a thought; for we no less
Than enmity eternally possess
Against what we desirer^ we still despair,
We cannot hope, yet still desiring are,
And what does breed in us the greater woe,
Is 'cause that to Aeternity we know.
It so continue must: anguish, and smart,
A stinging, prickling, akeing, sour, tart,
And horrid Grief torments us, then again
Desire breeds Anguish, Anguish breeds our pain;
And thus (though 't cannot be expressed) we feel
Aeternal Wrath, like to a turning Wheel
Which ever moves: And this to you I tell
The damned feel: These are the pains of Hell.
Our Prince, and we after the World was made,
Burned with a strong desire to invade
That new-made Orb; the which we could not do
Until our Cunning Adam overthrew:
Then we our Forces sent. What myriads we
Have gained to us your eyes shall witness be.
For it is our nature to gain what we can,
We love the noble Company of Man,
If not, why should we labor so? we were
Created of the substance your souls are,
And you like us may if you will become,
Here Is entertainment, and enough of room.
You see how well I love you, that I dare
Hel's pains and secrets, freely thus declare,
You may be sure that I would never do thus,
Did I not you esteem as one of us.
And you would confirmed be ever you return;
When that yo'ar entered where that fire does burn,
You Will understand what it is: you then in part
As we do, Wrath and enmity exert
Will against the Orb of Love. Nor what I tell
Think strange; would you of our own Principle
Have us be ignorant? or not to know
From whence we came? how enmity did grow
Betwix'd the second Principle, and us?
Forg t our former seats? you would make us thus
Like to you Mortals* who by sickness what
Before, or Age in Youth, they 'ave don forget.
We know mo^e then you think we do, alltho
We it to Mortals very seldom show;
Come let us stay no longer, you shall see
Hel's pomp, and 's mighty Stygian Majesty.
This said, they both together go: No flame
Or lighter blaze, from that dark fire came,
But 'twas like a dark-glowing coal, or like
A d'outed Candle, with a glowing week.
Here entered, now he feels an enmity
Against Love's Kingdom, and the Deity:
He sees the Devils, smells Sulphurian stinks,
Hears them blaspheme; himself a Devil thinks*
Does as they do. Thousands at first do meet
Him in most horrid shapes, with cloven feet,
With Dragons tails, and looks: hard scaly hides
Long-tusked teeth, jaws gaping far, and wide,
These usher them along: He also saw
Millions of Souls, who in such shapes did draw
Hel's faetid ay^ (a blast whereof would choke
The earthly Globe) their mouths spa^ fire, and smoke,
Their faces black as ink, cornuted some,
And very few retained an humane form;
And those that did were bunch-back'd, crooked, lamed,
One eyed, deformed, and more ugly seemed
Than those with other shapes; but now he met
The greater Princes in their order set.
Who'd think that Hell should there retain the Form
Of every thing that does this World adorn?
Why not? if Heaven the purer forms of these
Things uncorrupted bear; the Species
Impu^e, and corrupted, may not Hell
With as much reason think you hold as well?
Yea sure the Devils cloth themselves in all
Shapes may: excepting the Angelical;
As Angels cannot take a Devils hew,
So cannot Devils Angels shapes indue;
Both may an humane form; for sure he that
A soul can, may a body ag^^^te.
Thus then in brief the show of Hell was: when
With this fell rabble in that fiery den,
A while he marched had; A troop he met
Of many millions in their order set
Under their several Princes: on each side
Making a lane, they do themselves divide.
Some they were mounted upon Elephants,
Some upon Camels; and some vast Giants
Stood on their feet, whose heads like waving Trees
To shrubs: did shadow those that to their Knees
Scarce reached. Some others in their Char^^^ were;
And prauncing steeds do other Captains bear.
Some upon Wolves, some upon Asses ^ide,
Some Lions, Tigers, Whales, and Bears bestride:
All sorts of Instruments, they bear. Some horn
Their shining fronts, like yellow brass adorn.
Some heads like Dragons, some like Mast^^^^ bear:
With hispid mantles of dark pitchy hair.
Some hide their (...) hides: others are in
^ Dragons scaly Coa^: a Lions skin^
Others ind^e; (...) from their mouths a stink

Spew: some spit Toads, and Spiders, others flakes
O^ ^ire; and some instead of Hair have ^nakes
Dangling about their ^ares, and twisting round
Their necks, depend their tails unto the ground.
Such kind of Forms all bear. He still does (...)
Through this mighty T^^op: conducted was
By all the chief, until at last he came
Where seats a kind of Theater did frame.
At the upper end great Lucifer he saw,
(Whose ^ro^n keeps the Ta^arean troops in a^e)
S^t^on an Ebon Throne, more black than Jet,
And round about him Hel's great Princes set,
According to their ra^^ks. Great Lucis^r
A s^ble Crown upon his head did bear,
One hand a S^^pter held, the other bore
A hissing Snake, upon his back he wore
Nothing but griesly hair, more black than Night,
Under his s^percilious brow a Light
Like (...) coils came from his saucer eyes:
His rugged cheeks Like (...) Rocks did rise,
With dented Valleys: every time he spoke

Which intermixed were with flakes of fire.
His breast beset with ^air as stiff^ as wire,

(...)
His Banner broke in twain: hard by was^een

The potent Princes, every one a Throne
Possessed: Balzebub, Satan, Asmodel,
Miriri, Mammon, Ast'roth, Beli^,
With thousands more Commanding D^^m^ns, who
In strange, and various shapes appeared in view.
On's left hand sat Prince Pride, in's face Disd^^^

Finer than all the rest he was, one hand

The other held. Next him sat Envy, who
Did garments spec^'d with swelling ^oads indue:
A meagre Face h^ had, and hollow Eyes,
Lean jaws, thin neck, and spin^y arms, and thighs:

A cross his shoulders with live Snakes was tied:
A Lions foce he had. Next goati^h Lust
Sat in a Throne all overspread with dust,
A stinking smell he-had, the skins of Goats
Were tied about him in the stead of Co^ts:
The down of Sparrows want of hair supplied
Upon his scalp; his eyes on every side
Still rolled about. Tun-belly'd Drunken^esse
Sat next; his ugly shape a Tongue express
Cannot: nor's horrid brother Gluttony,
With thousands more, whom the man's (...) des^ry
Did in their Pomp: Amazed almost to see
So many Princes, 'bout Hel's Majesty
He nearer drew; when the great Prince of Hell
Shaking his drie^y locks these words did yell
Forth from his pi^chy mouth; black smoke, and flame
From's cursed throat with his words together came.
Welcome my Son unto these glowing parts,
I have considered thy great deserts,
For which I did permit that thou might see,
My Kingdom's Glory, and my Majesty.
Here is a Throne, and here a Crown lies by
For thee, when it shall be thy destiny
To leave the prison of thy Soul: I do
In the mean ti^^ any power confirm on you;
Thou shall my great Mag^tian be, and show
Strange uncoth Wonders in the Orb below.
Hau -- Let this blast imbue thy fetid Soul,
Accep^ may power, and let none control
Thy might, and force. Go to the Tree of Death*
Eat of the fruit, and so confirm my Breath:
Choose what thou please, there is choice, nay all
If thou can use them in the earthly Ball,
For our great Glory. Our great Mysteries
When thou have earen, thou will better prize:
When thou shall be confirmed: Love the^ shall fly,
None in thy Heart shall ever reign but ^.
This said, he nodded to the Prince that brought
Him thither, who conceived his Princes thought:
Doing obeys^nce both withdrew: and strait
Toward the Tree of Death they ambulate.
A narrow Vale they enter, where, nor Tree
Nor spire of grass, or any herb he see
Co^ld: on each side huge cloudy Rocks mount up.
Which hanging over almost kiss a top.
A thick, dark shadow, on the ground they cast;
From hollow crannies comes a ^aetid blast,
Which amongst the windings frames a murmuring voice,
And getting out (...) horrid hissing noise
Does make: Tho^ow the midst a pitchy stream
(The which from Styx and other Rivers came)
Runs; this they follow till they saw it shoot
Its sooty waters, at the very Root
Of the mortiferous Tree; in there it fell
Conveighing thither all the dregs of Hell.
By which that Tree is nourished: He now
Lifts up his eyes, and that strange Tree does view.
The trunck more hard than solid steel, for mo^^e,
With filthy spawn of Toads enclosed was,
Poison of Asps instead of shining gu^,
Through the bark from every limb did come.
Thrice fifty Cubi^^ scarce could close about
Its mighty bole: one every limb stretched out
Hung crawling Vipers, sucking with delight
The juice of Henbane, and of Aconite
From off the leaves, which gave a filt^y stink,
And were more black than Pitch, or blackest ink.
An horrid blast arising from the ground.
Concusse the leaves, which make a dryery sound
In their forced Kissing: Bitterer then soo^
Mixed with Gall, and Wormwood'd juice, the fruit
Was, which thick sparsed here, and there did grow,
In sundry^ co^ours on each sable bow.
A while he views this Tree: Hel's horrid Fiend
From's smoaky throat at last these wo^ds does send.
See thou this stately Tree, those Fruits I wis
Are our Ambrosi^; and our Nect^r is
That humid ^^yce you see; no other (...)
But what grows here our Prince esteems good.
No Winter with its nipping frosts bereaves
This lurid Tree of these his fable leaves:
Nor leaves, nor bl^ssoms adds the spring unto't:
Nor yellow Autumn robs it o^ its Fruit,
It thus continues as it is, and tho
We daily feed thereon it does not grow
Barren of ^ruit, for tho we cul apace
Others supply straitway their vacant place,
And should we off the Fruit we see now pull
Next moment renders it again as full.
We need not fear but h^re is choice enough
For every Prince has here his several bough.
Yon' fair spread arm whose fruit so rarely died,
Spec't like the Peacock's tail, yields food for Pride.
Yon Snake-betwisted bow, To^d-specled fruit
Does best the slaver^ng Chaps of Envy suit.
Yon' sire-coloured ^ome loves mighty (...)
Lust thinks that je^^y Apple better worth.
Yon' mighty Limb which b^^reth Apples thrice
As big as all the (...), Loves Av^^ice;
Yon' juicy Fruit which liquor does express
Through the skin loves beastly Drunkenness.
And those two thick fruit-pressed limbs close by,
Belongs to wantonness, and gluttony.
On that feeds sloth, and that arm which you there
Behold does serve the Table of despair.
Yon' strange-shap'd Fruit, which on that bow you ^ee,
Is sucked upon by foul-mouthed Perjury:
It Is endless to name all: Rare Fruit beside
All these, we have upon the other side.
Step hither, look! here^s gallant Fruit indeed;
Here it is, and if you please, that you shall feed;
These are the Fruits will open your dimmer eyes,
Will make you subtle, and exceeding wise.
These* these will show the virtue of this Tree;
And I will tell you what those Apples be.

Poring on books, enduring cold, and pain

The juice of this fine fruit did Herod lick,
When he a God was styled for's Rhetoric.
And that round apple, which hangs dangling there,
Will make you be a cunning Sophister.
You apple which is so variegate,
Will make you cunning in mechanics strait.
This Apple here which hangs so fair to view,

What Quadrats, D^ag^amms, Isoce'les

These show its Nature. But yon with a Star

And on the next they fed, when they in verse
Their Oracles ^id u^ually rehearse.
But you five Apples which I show you now,
And which do triumph on the upper bough,
Shall be thy food: See here I Will reach them down,
Make much of them, for now they are thine own,
Well may thou prize them, Heaven nor Earth such fruit
Can give, which may so well thy nature suit.
These with thee take, and feed upon below:
But first to thee I will their virtues show.
This purple colored one more cold than Ice,
Or Riphae an snow, extinguish in a trice
Will that Scintilla Love has placed in thee:
Then shall thou wholly from his chains be free.
Floods of temptations, nor whole streams of sin,
Nor pleasures, which the World may draw you in,
Are strong enough to dout that little spark,
Which closely gloweth in thy hollow ark.
Well may they cloak it that it may not flame,
But it is this fruit that must put out the same.
This next although more black than pitch it be,
Will firmly glue together Hell, and thee:
A thousand chains shall sooner break, than this
Resolve thee, of so strong a nature it is.
With all Hel's Peers, and our great Prince you will
By it hold highest Correspondence still.
By this third, snaky-colour'd one, below
Thou shall most strange-amazing Wonders do.
The Eternal flames which wend above the sky,
Unto the Earth thou may call by and by:
The Hyperborean sconce thou may command,
To aestuate the Sea to Mountains; and
May at thy bidding Taurus rend in twain:
Or Atlas fling into the Western main.
This reddish one bespotted thus with jet,
The locked gates of thy senses open will set;
Your quicker eyes although on Earth you stand
Shall pierce the Center of our darker Land:
Then shall you see us when you please, and know
How that your Prince, and we your Brothers do:
Our shriller voices shall assault your ear:
Your nose shall smell the sulphur of our Sphere:
And our hot breaths, feel blowing in your face;
Our Kingdom's dainties taste in every place,
Banquet and deeply drink with us: so you
May be on Earth, and in our Kingdom too.
By this last teter one, all evil Sprites
That b'longs to Hell, to please you with delights
You when you please may call, nay if you will
Ten thousand Legions shall attend you still.
All that belongs toth' Necromancy Art,
And Conjuration 'twill to you impart;
That at your beck from hence you may adjure.
The blackest Fiend to be your servitour.
Iannes and Iambres, Simon and Faustus eat
(Tho not to fill them) of this precious meat.
See now what power you are endued with,
By these rare fruits plucked from the Tree of Death:
The gold of In'd, nor Peru, not the Seas
Rich Treasure purchase may such Fruits as these,
The fabuliz'd Hesperian fruit of old,
Were dirt to these, although they were of Gold.
Come now thou great Magitian thou shall go
Unto the Body, which remains below;
Our Pomp, and Power, thou have seen, and I
To you our Kingdom's nature did descry:
You need no conduct hither now, for when
You please, you my come visit us again.
This said: he strait his body reassumes,
And thus Hel's great Magitian becomes.
My Muse returned from the darker Sphere,
Her garments rank of Sulphur smell I fear,
Which may offend: with those strange sights, which late
She saw affrighted, now shel'd titubate
Should she proceed: Like one which newly come
From long restraint in some dark Dungion
Cannot endure the splendid Light, nor dares
Sol's beams behold, so with my Muse it fares,
Who newly flown out of the house of Night
Dares not as yet describe the Orb of Light,
Till that in Jordan, she has bathed her eyes.
And Virgin Limbs, that she may brighter rise,
New modulizing of his Harp again,
To sing Heaven's Blisses in a higher strain.
The end of the first Part.
THE EXPLANATION OF AN Hieroglyphical Figure, SHOWING THE MYSTERIES OF THE
External, Internal, and Eternal WORLDS.
The second Part.
LOng may thou Phoebus pull my tender (...),
Ever I will my exalted notes for ^ear:
My Muse belongs not to thy mite^'d Hill,
Nor to thy teachings dos she owe her skill:
She from the double-top't (...),
Unto the flow'r-spread Hills of Paradise,
And there inspired by the Angels notes,
Her self, and Music to their King devotes,
Who with the verdant Wreath of Love, not Bays,
Crowns the choice accents of her tender lays.
Great Prince of LOVE! dain but to touch my tongu^
With some small coal from off thy Altar flung:
Inspire my Soul; ah let my words bespeak
Thy Glory! the row them Hearts* assunder break
Gla^'d over with steel: Here highest Complement
It Is to become thy happy instrument.
O so intrance me that in Raptures, I
May sing the glory of thy Majesty.
The misty horrors of Eternal Night
I'ave shown; the far surpassing joys of Light
Let Us visit now; a sight of much more worth.
May then my teeming Muse with ease bring forth
An happy issue! May my Numbers show
The way to Heaven from this Earth below!
How deare's Man's Soul unto the Prince of Light!
Who all does to his blessed Home invite,
Where all the pleasures, and blessed joys of Hea'vn,
To crowned Saints by his own hand are given.
Who would not Heaven acquire, if it only were
TO avoid the terrors of the darker Spheat?
Where howling Devils spitting fire, and flame,
In Wrath, and fury against bright Hea^'n blasphe^e;
Where naught but Sulphur, Fire, and brimstone hurld
About, gives light unto that impious World:
Where pains Eternal in dark cares below,
With ugly Devils thou must undergo.
But what allurements has blessed Heaven to give
To Souls that Chastely, and divinely Live!
What Joys! what pleasures! what true happiness
Do those blessed Souls in Paradise possess!
One single grain whereof more value holds
Than all the pleasures that this World enfolds:
Ah! these are mixed with sorrows, those have none,
Those are Aeternal, these are quickly gone.
When that Earth's vainer Pleasures I behold,
To Heaven's they seem like dung, to mounts of Gold:
Or like a pibble to rich Diadems
Beset with Diamonds, and more costly gem^^.
Ah let me woo you from this Sphere to move
Unto that glorious Orb of Light, and Love:
What tho, the way be thither somewhat strait?
The end ten thousand times will Compen^at^
All Labor: It Is unwilling minds alone
Find so much trouble, others they find none.
Thine Eyes turn to the Hieroglyphic, see
On the right hand the Orb, of Majesty,
Of Light, of Love: this Paradise is called
Which is with flameing Sword's of Cherubs walled:
Which none can enter but those flames must pass,
Which cleanse the soul: This manifested was
Once in the Earth; and here another Day
Its Royal Beauties shall again display.
It has a being, and the Heavenly wise
Upon his Earth, yet fire in Paradise;
Where they like Angels (tho in flesh they move)
Enjoy the pleasures of Eternal Love.
Here is the second Principle; here is
The Orb of Light, of Love, of Heavenly bliss:
Here is the Sun to New Jerusalem,
Which is the Light of it, the brighter gemm
Whereof it is composed; this is the Day
Which the row the Eternal Mansions display
Does its Caelestial Light: Heaven's Christ's Humanity.
King he is
As are the Saints, and Angels clothed with The second Principle, which is the
Life and light of Paradise,
this:
Long'st thou to dwell in this Caelestial place?
The way I Will show (helped by the Spirit of Grace)
Which if thou follow'st certainly arrive
Thou will, where Christ as King does Reign, and Live.
That we may show more plain unt^ your eyes
This milky way that leads to Paradise,
We will suppose (as in the darker Sphere
We did, so now we will exhibit here
One as) a Pattern, by whose footsteps y^
May view the way unto A^ternity.
An Angel's task it is; an Angel shall
Conduct him therefore to the highest (...).
And to that highest Pitch (tho reached by few)
That on this Earth may be attained to.
One then who does in Truth desire to leave
This mortal World, and to the immortal cleave,
Desires Heaven unfaignedly; but yet
Knows not which way his seeking face to ^et.
Like one who lost upon a wild Heath, ^ees
A hundred ways, and yet among all these
He knows not which to choose, nor whether they
May bring him home, or cause him farther stray.
Now this he treads, but by and by retreads
The same again, when that he sees it ^eads
Him false; now this he tries, now that, but when
He sees them false retreads them back again.

O man! Thy winged (...) have sped
Before the Throne of Grace: Heaven's Majesty
Has sent me to thee on his Embasie;
Heaven's King has made thee a free Deniso^
Of the Caelestial Jerusalem,
Where all wear Crown. Therefore prepare to go,
And I the way that thither leads will show.
Narrow, and strait at first appear it will*
And flesh will such asperities take ill*
It will both tedious, and unpleasing seem
To flesh, but yet a Will resolved will deem
It nothing; for the way to Heaven is
After some time both full of Joy, and Bliss.
Such happiness deserves some pains: yet set
Great price on what you do with danger yet.
This Earth alone does make the way seem hard.
Therefore resolve this first to disregard,
If thou resolved art come; procrastinate
Not now thy Time, next day may be too late.
The then resolved cries out: I Will not defer
The Time I Am ready sacred Messenger!
Under the Covert of his downy Wing
He takes him up, and the row the air does fling,
Unto a Valley which high Rocks surround,
Here he discharges him upon the ground.
A pleasant Tempe did it seem to be;
Here grew the Olive, and the Cedar Tree,
The shady Beach, under whose Canopy
Banks cushen'd with the verdant grass did lie,
Adorned with flowers, and sweeter herbs: he though^
The first flight him to Paradise had brought.
But thus the Angel cries: You now are in
The natural condition of sin:
This place the World does represent, and these
Fine things you see its Fonder vanities.
From hence a way you must find out, which found,
Proceed be sure, and do not lose your ground.
Nor make a stay: I at your greatest need
Unseen will help you; now I hence must speed.
This sai'd fanning the gentle air, his flight
He takes, and quickly passes out of sight
The left alone, a while the place does view,
But by and by upon a Bank he threw
Himself supinely; in the grass does creep,
And ever he was aware falls fast asleep. Natural states of man is sin.

Whilst thus he sleeps a troop of. Fa^^ies come,
Which round him dance triumphingly, while some
Anoint his eyes with Poppy-Juice? and other
With Soperiferous fumes his nosethrills smother,
And out of Bottles some pour down his throat
Somniferous liquor, from black L^th^ brought.
Long may thou sleep! Long may thou sleep! they cry,
And never wake out of this Lethargy.
But now the Time is come that all these Charms
Must be dissolved, raped out of Satan's arms
His Soul must be. A mighty clap of Thunder
As if the* Heaven's and Earth were rent assunder,
He hears, affrighted up he heaves his head,
And as if newly risen from the dead
He looks about, rubbing his scarce-op'd eyes,
When in a flash of lightning from the skies
An Angel with an angry Countenance
Descends: his hasty steps he does advance
Unto this supine Soul: one hand a goad
Held, in the other a sharp-scourging Rod.
With a loud voice I CONSCIENCE am cries he Conviction.

Who must awake thee from this Lethargy:
The pointed Goad into his flesh he ^lirks,
Whilst with the other hand he soundly jerks
His naked Breast. This sleepy Soul at first
Scarce feels the stripes: he then does farther thrust
The pricking Acus of his torturing Goad,
And with his Scourge lays on a heavier load,
Till that the blood from's flesh begins to spin,
And still the Angel cries awake from sin.
Thoroughly awaked he now begins to feel
The torturing anguish of the pricking Steel,
He now cries out; Acts 2. 37.
What shall I do? Oh! I
Cannot bear this pain! and up he starts to fly:
But round about a Mist as dark as Night
Fills all the place, only a little Light
About the Angel shines, by which he sees
His sad condition, and his miseries.
But up he starts and in the dark does run
Here up and down, but yet he cannot shun
The Angels strokes, who where some ever he goes
Renews his torments with reitterate blows.
And now all is former sins take shapes, and do
Where ever he goes appear unto his view;
Against his face they fly: Tormented, he
Cries: LORD from this sad HELL deliver me.
Whilst thus tormented up and down he flies,
At length a little shining Light he spies
On his right hand; to that he runs, and there
He finds a passage from this Valley: where
When he had entered, by that Light he saw
His former sins tied on both sides the way
In black, and ugly shapes; he loathes them now,
And fain would shun their sight could he tell how.
Amazed he stands: What did by bosom dain
Cries he; such ugly shapes to entertain!
Where were my eyes, that their deformity
And blacker shapes I could no sooner see!
O wretch that I did ever these commit!
Hel's sharpest torments I deserve for it.
O I am in the Wrath of God! my eyes
Pour forth your tears: How did Apostarize
My Soul? Horror of Cons^ience.
In this deplorable estate^
Expect no Mercy but Gods deepest Hate.
Oh with what anger the severer Judge
Beholds me now! I cannot go nor budge;
Where shall I fly? O! which way shall I run?
Or where can I God's sharper Justice shun?
I will not go back: Nor can I further go,
And in this place I am as loath to stay.
Drove to these straits what shall I do? too weak
Frail flesh, and blood, and frequent sins bespeak
Me, to perform those things the Law requi^es.
O sad condition! O tormenting fires
Of Wrath! O which way? which way shall I turn?
Hel's scorching flames within my bosom burn!
He thus perplexed a little farther goes,
When that a Silver torrent does oppose
His hasty steps. No other way there was
If he will proceed but the row those streams to pass.
Must I no farther go! (cries he) Constrain
Me not O B^ook! for to return again,
No rather here I Will dye: (upon the brink
Thereof the lets his feeble body sink)
Here shall my brinish tears increase your tide,
And shall as fast as your dull waters glide.
My eyes shall be your springs: you need not fear
A want of waters whilst that I am here.
If cold your streams with frosty fetters chain,
My warmer sighs them soon shall melt again.
Eyes open your sluices! Cataracts of Tears
Fall down: Repentance.
preserved you have these many years
Your sullen waters, against this time of need
For to bewail my sad estate. O speed
Into this gentle River; furrows make
Upon my cheeks, where you your Currents take.
Ah! Sins it is ye that cause these Tears to flow,
Ye only are the cause of all my woe.
It Is ye who brought me to this sad estate,
I now repent me, tho I fear too late.
My blubbered eyes now turn from you, I will,
I hate you all, and fly you. Eyes your fill
Now take of Tears: increase this River so
That Is streams may bigger than his Channel grow.
Whilst he for's former sins a Ransom pays
In Pearly Tears, and'spanting Heart does raise
Within his Breast, a tempest with his sighs,
A Man he in the gliding River 'spies
When to the Wast the greedy waters had
Devoured, his upper part was meanly clad
With a rough jacket made of Camels hair,
Which with a leathern Zone, upon his bare,
And tender skin was girt: By this he knew
'Twas John the Baptist, the Brook Jordan too.
Whilst with his vest the sporting waters played,
Two Crimson leaves disclosing, thus he said.
Art thou a Pilgrim to the holy Land,
In which the New Jerusalem does stand?
This then is the Way, no other way there is,
But the row this River to Eternal Bliss:
Here in these waters must thou oftentimes
Thy Body lave from all thy former crimes:
Here wash thy Soul, from all the stains of sin,
If thou intendest Heaven's high Race to win:
This Baptism by me thou first must prove
Ever thou attainest that of Fire, and Love;
This does prepare thee for the other; this
Will cool that Fire which now raging is
Within thy Bosom, for thy former sin;
Here thou wilt ^ind Peace, and Rest: Step quickly in.
His lips scarce closed were when the penitent
Leaped in, and gladly to the Baptist went,
Who there immerg'd him in the Crystal Tide
A many times, when on the other side
(Which melting Crystal in round bulla's fall
From's hair, and garments) placing him, he all
Alone there leaves him: But within his mind
He far less trouble, and more ease does find.
As if disloaded from a heavy weight
Of gives, and fetters which he bore of late
He feels himself; and like a Porter now
Discharged of what his back did underbow,
Himself does stretch for ease. But by, and by
A winged Post down from the Sky does fly, Pardon of sin.

In's Hand a sealed Parchment: this he does
To him present; the outside a while he view'th,
But opening it these words he written finds.
We whose right Hand at pleasure all things binds
And loses both in Heaven, and Earth: Great King
Of all the Worlds; who unto Hell can fling
All Mortals, and thence raise again; We do
For our Son's sake who fupplicates for you,
Remit, and Pardon all those sins to thee,
Thou have committed against our Majesty,
And ou^ most dear Son: Granted from ABOVE,
Sent by Belief; and sealed by gracious LOVE.
Down on his knees he falls, his eyes directs
To Heaven, and both his clasped Hands erects
On high: Dear Savior! (cries he out) O how
My prostrate Soul does to thy Mercy bow!
Lord! what am I that thou should supplicate
For me, poor worm? and from my sad estate
Into a Bliss not thought on ravish me?
O Jesus! Thy Love is immense I see.
O how I feel the blessed Effects of thy
Blessed Mediation! To thy wounds I fly;
Those sacred wounds, from which a Crimson tide
Of Sanctifying, healing Blood did glide,
By which thou have appeased the Wrath of God,
From me averted his chastizing Rod;
And gained this Pardon for my sins. Oh! how
I over my soul do feel it gliding now!
How sweet it is! my melting Soul now could
Dissolve; and Die a thousand Deaths it would
For thee my Savior. That I ever sinned
It me repents, against so sure a Friend.
Oh now I see how I resisted have
Against those motions that desired to save
Me from my sins: how sensible I am
Of my defaults! and now how full of shame
Am I! but thou have pardoned all. On fire
My heart is now; to dye I long: Require
Now what thou will, I ready am, and will
What ever it be, tho never so hard fulfill.
Ah Monsters, sins, on you my eyes I wink:
Oh! how I loath you when I on you think;
I now abhor you, and as monsters do,
Lest ye devour my Soul, shun all of you.
But Christ has pardoned what I did commit,
Now Eyes pour forth your Tears of Joy for it;
Break up new springs, and from your watery Cel,
Rivers, and Seas of joyful tears expel.
These are not bitter like your other cries,
If He prized them, he these will better prize.
Those flowed from Grief, but these from Joy do flow,
By (...) returns of Love these greater grow.
These not from sin, but from blessed Ioy^s do spring,
Though signs of ^rief, yet gales of Comfort bring.
When barren grow of lympid Tears my eyes,
Their want O breast supply with gro^ns, and sighs,
Caused y the drawing in of what I long
For: P^a^ses ever sit upon my tongue.
All my Soul's faculties to him still move,
Who so immensly has, and does thee Love.
Whilst thus he chaunts upon his bended knees
The song of Praise: he at a distance sees
T^o striving with an equal pace to gain
The place where he was: Wings the one sustain,
With which she cuts the gentle air, her feet
Scarce touched the Earth: the other with garments light
As ay^: painted with Anchors, was ador^^d
And's swiftly ran, and both os if they scorned
To be out-vy'd by Eurus swimming came
Unto the place where he was; Crimson shame
Perched on his che^ks, when he perceived they were
Two Heavenly Nymphs, and that they both did share
Their free embraces 'bout his neck. The Dames,
Perceiving it, discovered their Na^es.
We are two Sisters FAITH, and HOPE they cried,
Who from the Imperial Towr's are sent to guide,
And to support thee in this way, should thou
Selfly adventure here without us two
Thou 't quickly languish: Hope will thy desire
Nurse up, and keep thee that thou may not tires.
Faith will support thee, and by her thou taste
Shall Heaven's Joys, before thou them enjoyst.
Under both arms they take him up, and so
Fast linked together, in the way they go.
Swif^ (...) seems to loiter in the air,
A new-shot dait, nor swifter wind compare
May with their pace: He by those Nymphs so born
That scarce his feet upon the Earth does spurn.
The ruder way they left behind* and now
Enter a kind of Paradise they do:
Continual verdure still adorns the place,
Which called was they told him GOD'S FREE GRACE.
The Sun a lively splendour there did show,
Warming with gentle heat: sweet flowers did grow
On both sides as they went; the grassy floor
With a Smaragdine Carpet covered over
Did court their eyes, and in its lively green
The sparsed flowers like pretty stars were seen.
All sorts of the best Autumnal Fruits did sue
With their o're-loaded-bending arms unto
His Hand to cull their profer'd store: delight
And plenty both unto the Feast invite.
Since here he entered a new vigor seas'd
Upon his Heart, he feels it strangely eased.
New streams of gentle oil fall down upon
His Soul, he longs now after union
With Christ his Savior; his still warbling tongue
Sings Praise; and Halelujah is his Song.
Now from those everlasting streams of Love
Which on his Soul do flow: he thus does move
His lips, and tongve, creating in the air
Such vocal sounds as these. What may compare
O God! with thy free Grace? The Sun the Light,
Nor springs their streams, nor the aerial bright
Aura's their cool refrigera's so free
Do give, as thou this liberal Grace to me.
Not my deserts, but thine own Love, does cause
These streams of Comforts, and these gales of Joys:
These beams of Grace, of Grace so freely given,
Purcha'st by LOVE, by Love sent down from Heaven.
These may obedience to thy Laws require,
Obedient to be is my desire:
It is my meat, for it is Obedience can,
Conveigh the Nectar of the Gods to Man.
O how I Am rapt, my eyes perstring'd before
Did Christ.
thee beyond the fleeting Clouds adore!
At what a distance did I comprehend
Thee sitting at thy Father's dexter-Hand,
But now I see (those eyes too thou have given)
That thou have da^ed from the highest Heaven
For to descend, and my poor worthless heart
(...) Glorious Temple to Convert.
Now need I not to da^t my weaker eyes
Against the hol^^^ of the vaster Skies:
Now need I not seek to the deeps below,
Now need I not beyond the Mountains go
To find thee out; it is enough if I
Thee in my inward Temple seated 'spy.
Ah there thou art; Thy Beams of Light, and Love.
Thy streams of Glory do thy presence prove:
Thy gales of Comfort, Peace, and Joy, show clear,
That it is Thee, and I he alone dwells there.
A Malefactor when condemned to dye
Having no other Hopes, immediately
Before his execution a Reprieve
Comes from the Judge: How joyfully receive
The welcome news he does; when he does know
His (...) he to the Judge his Son does owe:
Who not his pardon only gains, but feasts
Him at a Banquet with his noble guests.
How hearty then are his acknowledgements!
How strongly to his Service his intents
Are fixed* how he to every one does praise
His Mercy, and his Bounty; and always
Obedient, and officious is glad
If he occasions has to serve him, sad
If he has none: but by degrees (these heats
By Time, and Pleasures vanquished) he forgets
The dangers past, and what he ows to him
That saved his life; at least the sense of them
Is not so fresh, nor his desire as
Strong for to serve him as at first it was.
So our Caelestial Pilgrim for a while
With th'apprehension of his Savior's smile
Ravished, chaunts forth his praises, and with Joy
Poures forth his Soul, which feels no annoy:
And whilst that lively apprehension lasts
How over-sweet his f^eer Bounty tastes!
In this delightful way our Pilgrim now
On each side held by Faith, and Hope, does go:
With so much ease, and pleasure moves he, that
He thinks that he to Paradise is got
Already; little dreams the Rocks that he
Must pass before he there instated be.
All things for to enjoy he seems, and says
He union has with Christ; and that by Faith
He Heaven possesses, that the work is done;
Before that it in Truth is scarce begun.
His present Joys, and sweeter frame of spirit,
Makes him suppose he does all things inherit,
Thinks himself safe; and carried thus at ease
Betwixt two Nymphs, the way does greatly please,
So that by little, and by little, he
About his heart feels a stupidity,
His eyes are heavy, and his senses dul'd
With ease, ever he is aware to sleep he is lulled.
And whilst he sleeps he dreams he travels on,
With that swift pace with which he first begun.
This drowsy nap not lasting long he 'wakes,
Rubbing his eyes, his lither limbs he shakes,
And looks about, his sees himself alone,
And those two Nymphs which him supported gone:
The place of pleasure's vanished too; and now
Dark clouds, and sadness hang on every bough.
New troubles now arise, a deadness he
Sees all about, more in his Soul does see.
But not unmindfull of his journey, still
He would proceed; but when he forward will,
Instead thereof he backward steps, or else
Upon one side: he knows not what he ailes,
Nor how to help himself.
Anon he 'spies
A Troop of fluttering Imps, into his eyes
Some fly, and others perch upon his tongue,
Some pierce into his brains, while oth^^s clung
Unto his Fingers end. This Troop they call
The Troop of shadows merely notional.
His eyes more dark with Notions see the Hull
And nothing else: His busy brains now full
Of these pert impes, do set his tongue on wheels,
Which tyring, straight his fingers itch he feels
For to be venting of these Notions, that
His over-busie working brains begat.
And now he talks of Christ; his blood, his death
His Life, and his Ascension, and does
Wander into the heights, mysterious
He others, and himself beguileth thus.
Our Pilgrim having slipped into this path,
And having lost the Sisters Hope, and Faith.
Begins to wander, and to rome about,
When on a sudden from a Bower slipped out
A comely Dame, who thus bespeaks him, Know
My name's Misapprehension. Sir you go
Along with me, and I Will bring you where
A many of your fellow Pilgrims are.
He taken with Her beauty, and her speech,
Without delay his Hand to her does reach,
Strait they passed the row the Bower of Deceit,
Into a place where many sat, their Their Affections.
feet
By the World's Sp'rit chained to their chaires, which she
Told him were called Seats of Security.
Before his eyes each had a picture placed,
That represented all their Voyage past,
By whom stood False-Persuasion wite his cheat,
That their Regeneration was complete,
And that if they never shirred from that place
They Would done enough: They could not fall from Grace.
Charmed by Persuation he is about to seat
Himself in those bird-limed Chaires; his feet
They are about to shackle, when his fair
Tutelar Angel beat the gentle air
With his displayed Wings, his radient brows
His glorious presence to our Pilgrim shows.
Betwixt a frown, and smile, his Wings he shook
About his eyes, and thence all Notions struck:
The Scene straight vanished, and the comely Dame
Misapprehension, slunk away for shame.
What Pageant's this? (cried he) how came to stray
Into this Fal^e, from Heaven's direct^r Way?
Would thou have been insna^ed thus? Is this
The New Jerusalem? or Paradise?
Di^st thou not taste H^av'n's sweet Ambrosia,
Whilst thou continuedst in its righter Way?
How came tho^ thence? how did thou lose that Path?
Where are thy Virgin-guides true Hope, and Faith?
Do thou not see the cheat thou were about
To enter? art thou willing to go out
From this deadness of Spirit? and proceed
In that true Path where thou must die indeed?
His Knees strait kissed the Earth; his words with sigh^
Were intermixed, ^is tears ^an from his eyes:
IN ave erred indeed I must confess: but how
I hither came I do not rightly know.
I thought I had to Paradise attained;
So great the pleasure was, the which I gained
Whilst in that Path I did my voyage make,
That 't lulled to steep; and whilst I slept, forsake
Me Hop^, and Faith both did; sure whilst I slept
Ou^ of that Path, into this way I crept.
How willing am I to retrive the way
I trod before, would Heaven its Light display
To help me hence: To beg can I begin
Who was so lately pardoned for my sin?
O Heaven I beg would if I dare to do it,
My crime, and my unworthiness strikes mute
My Fault'ring Tongue; yet if it be thy Will
O Lord! from begging, shame my lips sha'n't still:
Show me the way, and with thy Light direct
My steps, and though a thousand Mounts obstruct
My progress, I (if strengthened by thy Grace)
The Row all will press unto thy holy place.
Though I am weak, yet I am willing, Lord!
Thou can, and if thou please help afford.
Prostrate upon the ground he falls, his cries
With true contrition winged, mount the skies;
Hea'vn hears, and pity takes: Immediately
From thence des^ending he does GRACE espy;
With her a troop of heavenly Nymphs, whose Rays
With their bright luster his weak eyes amaze:
Sol shows less glory, when he heaves his head
Dressed with Roses from his Eastern bed,
Than this great Queen: her eyes more beamings than
He, when he mounteth the Meridian,
(...) chiefest splendour gives; than Cynthia
When at the full she makes a second Day
More ^air she is: And she that troop of hers
Surpassed as Cynthia all the lesser stars.
Her garments far more white than Riphaean snow
Hid a more candid skin, her lips did show
Nothing but sweetness, and when ever she spoke
Ten thousand chains fell from her tongue, which take
All Souls that hear her captive; never yet
Our Pilgrim's eyes so sweet a sight had met.
Those glorious beams which shon about her Face
Perstring'd his weaker eyes, and made him place
Them at her feet; which she perceiving drew
Over those dazzling beams a Vail, that view
Her he the better might: Two Rosy leaves
Expanding (by the which her breath receives
More than a Roseal sweet perfume, as it
Passes those Portals) she these words did fit
Unto's attentive ears. No sooner move
Can Man, Petitions to the Prince of Love,
But they are granted; and sometimes are sealed
Before his tardy tongue has them revealed.
Nothing but Love, mercy, and pity he
Is unto all, and can no other be.
Part of himself I am, and ever stand
Pressed for these Embassies at his right hand;
To none will he at any time deny
(If they sincerely ask) my Company:
I Queen am of that place of such delight,
Whose heavenly Beauty recreates the sight
Of all that enter there, and now I come
To let you see unto Jerusalem
The heavenly, the true Way: such guides I Will leave
That if you will follow none can you deceive
With false illusions, nor draw aside,
But be you sure to follow still your Guide.
Although you able are to comprehend
The whole World in a thought; yet if you bend
Your whole Imagination to conceive
The Glory of Jerusalem; bereave
The Earth, the Seas, the Skies of all, what e're
May glorious, or beautiful appear,
And with them frame a glory, all shall seem
Unto the glory of Jerusalem
But as a grain of dust, to mighty Gemms,
Or as a Candle to the Sun's bright beams.
That I may give thee some small glimpse of that
Most glorious House, I have a Picture brought
With me of it; and that I may invite
Thee with its beauty to attain't, a sight
Thou shall have of 't.
Vision.
APOCALYPSIS then
She called, a Nymph that is much desired of Men.
Her tresses hung like waves of gold upon
Her shoulders; her transparent garments shon
With far more lustrous beauty than a gemm
Diaphanous; Earth's Beauties were in them
With Heaven's intermixed: a curious Hand
Had here the Sea, and there the stable Land,
With Groves, and Rivers, Gardens, Founts, and Springs
With all Earth's pleasures, and all living things
Expressed: The Sun, the Moon, and Stars he might
With all the Beauty of the Heaven's delight,
Fully behold, wrought with Stones highly prized:
The Heavens, and Earth were there Epitomized.
So that she shon like the bright Evening Star,
Or Phoebus mounted in his high-noon Carr.
A Crystal Key with which the inward sight
She did unlock, her left hand held; her right
A scroul of Paper: This GRACE did unfold,
That he might there Jerusalem behold.
His greedy eyes fixed on the Scroul did wait
When her blessed hands would open the picture; straight^
VVayes the unfolding it, more dazzling beams
Than could proceed o^t of a mass of g^mms
Flew thence, and like the agill Lightning struck
His eyes, perst^ng'd them, and his Body shook.
Prostrate he fell not being able to
Bear all those Beauties which together Flew
From thence. This splendour is too great, he cries
For to be looked upon by mortal eyes:
Heaven's Eaglets only can behold this Sun
And without striking blind their eyes, upon
It gaze; How will it perform thy word to me?
Unless thou giv'st new eyes I cannot see.
If that a shadow of its glory does
Perstring thine eyes (says Grace) and 'maze thee thus,
What will the full fruition of it do,
When in its h^ghest luster it by you
Shall be beheld? An Alabaster box
Her snowy Hands with a cold Key unlocks,
From whence she drew a Sovereign eye salve, made
Of Purity; upon his eyes she laid
The same, and bid him boldly view the Light,
For that pure Salve from hurt would guard his sight.
At her Command his baulmed eyes he now
Erec'ts, and does that glorious splendour view,
Which does proceed from the bright radiant gemm
Of which is made the new Jerusalem.
A glorious City there he saw: the Pen
Nor Heavenly Tongues of Angels, nor of Men
Can it express; or half its Glory tell;
Its beauties, other beauties all excel,
More than the brightest gemm, dark glass, or far
More than Gold dirt; or Sol the meanest star.
Raped in a kind of ecstasy he moves
In that bright splendour, round the City roves
He with his eyes, taken with so much bliss
His Soul out of his body wrapped is
Himself among the Thorns he sees, and there
Views, what his tongue to utter does not dare.
O glorious Beauty! (cries he out) one gra^^
Of thee will more than recompense all pain,
And trouble that we on the Eard endure,
For to possess thee. O bless't Light immure
My Soul for ever here, where reigns true Bliss,
Where is true Joy, and where true pleasure is.
Adieu vain Earth, and all thy foolish pleasure,
Worser than Dung compared to this Treasure,
And Joys I find. Ah what are Crowns to thee
Least particle of true Felicity!
Lighter than chaff, of less esteem they are
Than dung, if they with heaven's bright Crowns compare.
O how I Am rapt! O how I now esteem
The glorious Vision of Jerusalem!
Grace smiling at his Rapture, warbled forth
These words. This sight of such esteem, and worth
Is, that to very few it granted is
The favor to behold this sight of Bliss.
Amongst those very few thou see thou art,
For ever then record it on thine heart,
And let this Beauteous sight attract thee (...)
That thou astray may not hereafter go.
Nor think that thou already art in Bliss,
This but a sight (and at a distance is)
Of fut^re happiness, which gain you may
If you persever in the stricter way.
But if backslide, and in your sins remain,
This Heavenly City you shall never attain.
How vain the choysest of Earth's pleasures are*
If with the least of these, you them compare!
Let this consideration beget
A fire of constant sacred Love to it,
So that thou may with greater ease press on,
Till thou the harder way have overcome:
For if thou do heaven's Beauties contemplate,
Earth's, in compa^ison to them thou wilt hate.
Whilst to this sight thine Eyes are married,
The way thou se'st not that does thither lead,
Its glorious Beams o'te-shadow it, but I
By vailing them exhibit to thine eye
The way that leads unto this City will
A thick mist strait does her command fulfill,
Which like a Vail hid those illustrous Beams,
And now the way portrayed he sees: it seems
To lie here over Rocks, the row Valleys there:
Here dark black Caves, there Seas of Blood appear;
Here precipices thick, here thorns, here steep
And stony places, there strong Watchmen keep
The passages: a thousand dangers show
Themselves along the way that he must go,
If he to Salem will attain: His eye
About he cast, no other way espy
He could, so that necessity compells
He that ways must, when there is no way else.
Nor Rocks, not precipices, nor (cries he)
Sanguineous Seas, now shall discourage me,
Since I have seen those Beauties, which do Court
My Soul; for which all dangers seem a sport
Will: for it is fitting that Aeternitie
With fleshe's hazard should attained be.
Come I Am resolved, and ready am to tread
This narrow Path which does to Sion lead:
I Will leave this World, and for my future good
Fly over Rocks, swim through Seas of blood.
This said, APOCALYPSIS then withdrew,
And GRACE her hand did to the Pilgrim show,
A hearty Kiss on which he straight inferred:
Unto the path from which he lately erred
She him conducted, where stood HOPE, and FAITH,
Who ran to him as soon as in the Path
He came: To whom themselves the' excused thus;
For your deviating pray blame not us:
'Twas your own fault; for whilst we with you kept
We know not how into a sleep you slipped;
So heavy then you were we thought you dead,
And hating dead men's company, we fled:
For always we do use to be so bold,
To fly from Pilgrims if they lose their hold.
Our tender wing cannot bear from Earth, Men that
Fall fast asleep, or are inanimate.
GRACE from her Chore a trine of Virgins chose,
Whom duty on their knees before her throws
And fixing their bright eyes upon her face,
The' expect with Joy the Precepts of her Grace.
Strait ways she with a beck commands them,
To guide the Pilgrim to JERUSALEM:
And constantly to 'bide with him, until
He had attained sacred Sio^'s Hill:
Her feet, and the Earth thrice kissed they bow, and rise,
Themselves presenting before the Pilgrim's eyes:
The first was Truth.
Alethia, whose fair face,
And all her body, shon like Crystal Glass:
Diaphanous her garments were, upon
Her shoulders hung a mantle like the Sun,
F^inged with Gold, before with Azure tied,
And two great Saphirs upon either side;
Which by reflection darted all about
Such Beams that almost had the Sun put out.
The next was trusty Watchfulness.
Vigilantia
In whose bright Orbs was seen a constant Day:
Sprightly she was: her watchful eyes she cast
About, lest danger might unseen be placed
In any corner. In a vestment clad
She was, in which more eyes than Argos had
Were wrought: here white, black, gray, green, purple, sky^
Colored Siric composed a lively eye:
Carnation, white, and yellow here, and there
With artificial turnings framed an ear.
A Pearly Coacha in her hand she held,
Whose blast soft slumbers from her eyes expelled,
Humility came last; where in the books
Of her dejected, yet well-pleased looks,
In blushing Characters might modesty
Be plainly read: Wool clothed Humility:
A stoll of Frize she had, under her Paps
A Leathern girdle did her garments clapse.
A sacred Cross with both her hands she held,
Fast to her breast; on which her lips still dwel'd:
And though her face with lowliness was dressed,
Her eyes an humble loveliness expressed:
No shining Rays indeed adorned her head,
But her bright eyes as great a luster spread.
After our Pilgrim had all three embraced,
GRACE them about him, in this order placed.
Before went Alethia, whose bright Ray
Exhibited unto his eyes the Way.
To his right hand Humility combined
Was: Vigilantia to his left: behind
Went Faith, and Hope, who always ready were
At need on both sides, or before to appear,
Proceed (said GRACE) in greatest dangers still,
And when you need have, I assist you will.
O^r Pilgrim thus accompan'ed, with Joy
Enters a narrow, and obstructive Way,
At every step some rugged stone does greet
With har^h Salutes, his bare and tender feet:
The more he hasts the more he titubates,
The fa^ther he proceeds the greater straits.
But generous Humility befriends
Him, with a Staff, to him her Cross she lends:
On this he leans; goes now with more delight,
For when he stumbles, it keeps him upright.
Without the Cross it folly is to tread,
The path which to immortal Crowns does lead,
Great opposition all the way he goes
Both from his outward, and his inward foes
He finds: but does maugre their forces come
Unto the Gate of Circumcision.
A narrow Gate it was, on both sides were
Hooks, Sickles, Sythes, and Lances that would tear
The fleshly hide of all that entered by it:
Over the portal this appeared in sight.
O SOUL LET NOT THESE WEAPONS THEE AFRIGHT,
FLESH ONLY SUFFER MUST WHICH THEE RESTRAINES.
THESE WILL BUT BREAK THY PRISON, GIVE THEE LIGHT,
AND CUT IN TWO THY ADAMANTINE CHAINS:
NO OTHER WAY THERE IS BUT THIS, AND THOU
OR NOT AT ALL, OR NAKED MUST GO TH'ROUGH.
What will not a desperate Rabble do, when: they
See Death its Banners before their eyes display?
Extremity will make the Cowards fight,
And of ^ surpass the force of greater might.
So now the Flesh, the (...) and Devil view
Their utter ruin if he enters the row
This Circumcising Gate. Nile's Catatracts
Never from the Mountains fell with greater cracks,
And violence, than they upon him ^ush,
Whose strong encounter did him almost brush
Unto the Earth: But holding fast the Cross,
He got upright, and had but little loss.
They altogether him assault again,
Over, and over: But (as in the main
A sturdy Rock beats back the b^llows, and
Immovable spite of their rage does stand)
Undauntedly our Pilgrim holding fast
Unto the Cross: Them to the Earth does cast.
But subtle Satan skilled in Wars, well knew
That stratagems more than plain force could do:
He saw it was a Folly to assault
Resolved Man, unless his will revolt.
Therefore to bribe her Earth her Riches brought,
And sent them to her by disguised Thought.
A pack of Pleasures at her feet she flung,
Another full of Honors: and a long
Sack full of Riches: gallant Or^^ments,
Buts full of wine, and choysest meats, presents
More costly promised to the Senses, and
The Passi^^ns would they deal but underhand
To stop the Pilgrims voyage: If he do
Pass the row that Gate, ye all shall perish too
She cried. At last she does persuade the Will,
The Senses, and the Passions to rebel.
^ntestine foes are fa^ more dangerous,
Though but a few: than far more numerous
Who openly their Banners do display:
Forth' others ever we are aware betray
Us to our Deaths. False will persuades him now
For to consult before he passes the row
The Gate in sight: And as a Friend does call
Thought to the Council, who straight rips up all
The fancied dangers he must pass, if he
Pass the row that Gate where was Austerity;
And where he must Earth's Pleasures quite forsake,
And over Rocks, and Seas a voyage take,
Which few besides himself went in; when that
At 's Body's dissolution a Cut
Far shorter he might make: The Senses then
To rus^le in their discontent began,
Accusing him that they who were his Friends
He did intend to bring to cruel ends.
The Passions then flow high, and Anger straight
Told him he did intend to innovate
Strange Laws amongst them; and their Liberty
Should utterly be lost, and if that he
Proceeded in that Way: and Flesh who was
Their Friend was threatened most if he did pass.
The Pilgrim thus befet, pale Fear, and Doubt
With open wings came fluttering about
His Ears: and now he staggers: TRUTH ^e sees
Waits for him at the Gate. Down on his knees
He falls, and cries for help: These chains Lord break
The Spirit's willing though the Flesh be weak.
A tender Infant's City never Mother called
With more maternal speed (that what it ailed
She might know; doubt^ng each Stone in the Way
It Is ^ender legs might to a fall betray)
Then GRACE new summoned by the Pilgrims Cry,
Hasted down from her Throne of Majesty.
Her Beauty made his adversaries start,
The Will shrunk back and shw'd a fainter heart.
GRACE though she could have with one single dart
The stubborn Will pierced the row her Steely heart.
Laid by her threatening Weapons, and did show
The suavity she ever used to do:
And smiling, thus unto the Will she spoke,
What is the reason that you would forsake
The Pilgrim to his Bliss? Shall pleasures? sense?
And Passions strong conspiracy from thence
Detain you? it is the World and Satan that
Hat^ circumvented you into this Plot.
All what they prom^se are mere shaddows, know
That all things ^e so that are here below.
Why fear this Gate? This will indeed conduct
You to a higher Sphere; your Way obstruct
Back to the Dunghill Earth: what then? if here
You pleasures find, much more in that bright Sphere
You shall unto Eternity enjoy;
And there where is an everlasting Day
You shall reside, enthroned in (...) shall be
One with that Will which first created thee.
Shall Earth to Heaven be preferred? below
How full of ugl^nesse do all things show
To eyes which heaven's Beauties see; dung never
Did unto Jewels half so vile appear.
Will thou not then forsake this world, and pass
Through this Gate unto this blessed place?
Let my entreats of Love prevail so far,
When for your happiness they spoken are:
Be not a Captive to the world, but be
One unto Heaven, and that is to be free.
A thousand Rays fled from her eyes, as fast
As from her mouth flew Word, with which they past
Into her Heart, wherewith such melting Love
Like soft oil mixed with W^ne about they move:
Down falls the will, and by her looks does show
That now she is willing the row the Gate to go.
The Will thus gained the Pilgrim values not
The Senses, not the Passions, weaker plot:
By her he 'd tame them whenever they
Shall dare to appear for to obstruct his Way.
Now Faith, and Hope anew their plumes do ^ear,
And from him with their Wings brush Doubt and Fear.
No longer now the World, nor Satan can
Withold him: their entreats, and Threats in vain
Are? now he is resolved, and though they fling
Themselves upon his neck, and 'bout him cling,
He passes on, and the row the Gate does press.
Those Hooks, and Sythes his heavy load redress:
One pulls off Satan by the heels: The Sp'rite
Of the Great World another ^ook does light.
All grosser sins, and vainer pleasures, by
A Sithe cut off, jumbled together lie
Upon the ground: a I an^e the flesh rips up:
And noughty thoughts cu^ from the head do drop
Unto the Earth: Flesh feels the worser smart
Which pierced is unto the very Heart.
Past through he views himself, extuberancies
Which obvious were are all cut off he sees,
But smaller wenns stack closer to his skin,
And other hidden Griefs lay close within,
Which hooks, nor Sythes had yet cut off, but these,
A ha^der task, pared must be by degrees.
For now he knows Mortality he must
Loose ere he sees Jerusalem the blessed.
No sooner past this narrow Gate, but they
Enter an asper, and a narrow W^y;
At first nor Trees, nor grass he found, nor did
See any place for to repose his Head;
Both sides with Rocks were walled, Asperity
The one side paved, the other Poverty
The way of SELF-DENIAL this they called,
The Walk of Trial, where Obedience dwell'd.
The Stygian Proteus, varies shapes, more than
The cloudy Pictures in the Sky; a Man
There you may see, and by and by the same
A Lion, Horse, and then a Bear become.
So he who at the Circumcising Gate^
In shape of Grosser sins pulled off of late,
More Spiritual^z'd becomes, like Anicus grows
More strong by's falls; whilst to the Earth one throws
Him in one shape, he rises up anon
Clothed in another and as strong again.
Like P^ lius therefore with him we must Cope,
With chains of Persev^rance bind him up.
Or else like Hercules this Anteus Crowd
To Death, betwixt the Arms of Fortitude.
We must not think but he will tempt us still,
Until we come unto that sacred Hill
Where we may say: Satan avoid, and know
A Deity commands thee to bow.
Then otherwise he shall not dare to do,
Us then shall Angels minister unto.
Long in this path our Pilgrim had not gone,
But on a sudden he is set upon
By a great Satyr; Lust^
on his back he wore
The bristly Jacket of a new-slain Bore.
His sleeves were hispid Goat Skins; and upon
His Crest a great bunch of Satyrion,
Orchis, and Southernwood instead of plumes
Waved: All his garments stunk of strong perfumes:
The juice of Ash his Face besmeared, his hair
With Nutmegs powdered was: his right hand bare
A Shield in which was pourtrai'd Pasipha*
Faustina, Messalina, Hellena.
I who have made the mightiest Monarchs bow,
Must I fight with so small a Pigmy now?
I Will stop thy farther passage: cries he out:
The first blow of this fair-fac'd Sword shall do it.
Straight this sallacious Monster from his side
A Weapon drew, whose strength he often had tried.
At him he ran with it: But from the Sword
His head the Pilgrim with the Cross to guard
Did think, when straight the Sword conver^ted to
A naked Nymph, who in that shameless hew
Yet full of a fictitious Beauty, flung
Her Ivory arms about his Neck, and clung
Close to his Body, wrestling all the while
To trip him up, yet in his face did smile.
In the mean time the Satyr with his claws,
Endeavored to open his closed jaws,
Having a poisonous Filtre in his hand
The which he meant to make him swallow, and
Fescinan Songs singing with Goatish breath
The Pilgrim h' almost stifled had to Death.
Great danger was he in both Faith and Hope
Strove till they weary were: The Will did Cope
Being now resolved most strenuously, and now
Her armed courage did to purpose show.
But in his greatest danger, almost spent
With this certation GRACE assistance sent.
A Nymph does (one of her bright Train) appear
Whom purple Wings of chasest Turtles bear
From the polluting Earth. Chas^i^y.
More white than snows
Her garments were, a Lillied Crown her brows
Precing'd; her neck a chain of Saphirs, and
No spots had ever her pure garments stained.
In her sweet eyes Rare Modesty kept Court,
Alternate blushes on her Cheeks did sport,
S^lence sat on her Tongue, and Beauty spread
A lovely splendour, all about her Head.
Of all the Nymphs the Pilgrim yet had seen,
This in his eyes for Beauty seemed the Queen.
Hearts could not choose but do her homage, not
If Heaven Love, refrain from loving her?
Day never came forth out of the Eastern Gate
With so bright face, or so immaculate.
A Shield one hand did bear, where you might see
Joseph, Diana, and Penelope,
Susa^na, and the Apostles Maid, who bare
The World's Redeemer, and Him pourtrai'd there.
Green Lettice sugared with Continence
Upon a snow-white plate of Abstinence,
Sharpened with Labo^^r; in her other hand
She brought, and did close by the Pilgrim stand.
As fair Aurora with the brush of Light
Strikes down the Cobwebs of the ^ordid Night
From off the face of Heaven every morn,
The Light which did this Nymphs bright face adorn,
Struck from the Pilgrim those black clouds of Lust,
And to the Earth both Nymph, and Satyr thrust,
Who getting up together slunk away
From her, as Night steals from the approaching Day.
Then of the Salad to the Pilgrim she
Gave, who inamou^'d was immediately
Of her rare Beauty: straight his arms he throws
About her neck, and till she had his brows
Impaled, with her white Crown of Lilies, kept
Her prisoner; which b'ing done the air she swept
With Wings, that did a purity bestow
Upon the ambient air where she did go.
Scarce had he finished an hymn of praise
Unto that potent King of Victories:
But that an other opposite he saw
Whose face seemed both the Heaven, Pride.
and Earth to awe.
Upon a Steed he mounted was, whose hoofs
Disdain the Earth, the air he proudly snuffs;
And being rained in, from's champing chaps
Of milky suds a frothy River drops.
The Rider far more proud, had on his head
The Helm of Insolence, which was bespread
With the fine train of the Iunonian Bird?
The Belt of Arrogance his sides did gird,
At which Ambition hung, the weapon that
Had often laid many mighty Princes flat.
His looks spoke full disdain, scorn clothed his brows,
And haughtiness his high-rear'd forehead shows.
Big language dwelt upon his tongue, the Lance
Of Power he in his right hand did advance.
A Scarf of God besieged his arm; the East
Had lent its Jewels to adorn his breast.
He scorned to speak, but with his lofty eyes,
From whence a flash of scornful Lightning flies,
Which scard the Pilgrim, but affrighted he
For safeguard runs behind Humility.
She with the Cross as this proud Foe came on
With blows reitterated beat him down:
The Pilgrim then his glory, and his pomp,
And's Lance of Power under his feet did stamp:
And so bemaul'd him with his Cross, that he
Feared no more this doughty Enemy.
Cyclopian darts now rend the tumid Rocks, Wrath.

A horrid rore against their intrails knocks;
Where in the windings, with a new rebound
It sends forth more than a Stentorian sound.
The humble Valley quivers: Earth seems now
To totter, and to be unstable too.
The amazed Pilgrim fears, he thinks that Hell
Could hardly have created such a Yell.
The Sire of this he sees; a Polypheme
Who did with Clouds of smoke the Heavens dim,
A walking Tower from whose nosethrils came
A scalding Whirlwind; from his eyes a flame.
His right hand bore a Pine; his left a Shield,
Where flaming Aetna in a sable field
Was portrayed; On his lofty crest he wore
A scaly Dragon, on his breast he bore
A Tun of Iron: the neighboring Rocks he down
Kicked, that he might to walk have elbow-room.
He opes his mouth the Postern Gate of Hell
And these words bellows with a rending Yell.
Where goes this Dwarf? did never hear of me?
My name is w^ath, my left hand Cruel^y;
My right is Power, to which all Hell below
Obeys: with which these Rocks like Balls I throw.
And what art thou? poor Pigmee! if I list
To atoms I can crush thee with my fist.
Do thou know what thou do? we did this Way
Prohibit Men: how dare thou disobey?
Thou have awak'ned me, and now my power
Thy Soul, and thee together shall devour.
It Is time to make thee tremble, for if thus
Thou do proceed, thou wilt Triumph over us.
A score of Canons which with Sulphur strout,
When they their flaming intrails vomit out,
Scarce make a sound like that the Cyclops made
To periodize his speech, when this h' had said.
Now thinks the Pilgrim, I am dead; who may
Defend me? or this Monster's wrath allay?
He had no sooner thought, Meekness.
but from the Skies
A Nymph descending to his succor hies.
Smoother than Crystal was her Skin, more fine
And soft than childrens: or the Ser^an twine
With which she clothed was; Her badge a Lamb
Was, and like such a candid one she came.
Her eyes spoke Innocence, her lovely looks
Of Comity, and Gentleness the books
Were: in her hand she held a glass of oil
Which like a Zeilan Ruby shun the while:
The Glass was Mercy; the Oil our Saviors blood:
Approac^ing near, she by the Pilgrim stood.
This P^ophylac^^c Oil alone, Cries she
Can keep you from this Giants tyranny:
It Is he that did the Lamb of Life deprive,
But from that Death spr^ng this preservative,
Whereby you may spite of this furious one,
Pass on, and shun him, and by this alone.
The Pilgrim straight the Glass of M^rcy took
And drunk the sacred oil, fear then forsook
And blessed Joy, and Courage took the field
Humility was his A^acian Shield;
Meekness gave him her Vail, and now the Wrath
And all his menace were little worth:
For all his Thunders fly too high to hit
Him, who does under Meeknesse' umbra sit.
What ever wound the Cyclops gave, was by
That blood he drank recur'd immediately.
Thus he passed on whilst that the Wrath in vain
The air beat, but could not the Conquest gain.
A little farther a strange Hag he met
Whose mouth spat clouds of smoke as black as jet, Env^.

Her nose the chimney for her Hellish breath
An Aetna seemed, her eyes, sunk in like Death
Two glaring Ovens were; her shriv'led cheeks
Sunk like two Valleys, and as black as Styx.
Her tauny Breasts like falling Mountains hung.
Two mighty Serpents 'bout her middle clung,
Two in her hands she brought, and from her head
A thousaud Aspe^ her Back and shoulders spread:
She did with scaly Wings of Dragons fly,
The one Det^action, the other Jealousy.
Hasty she came, and from her mouth flew fumes
Like smoke which from a Brewer's Furnace comes.
Ten Paces yet she lack't, when that a dart
From an unseen hand struck through her hellish heart:
Down fell this Tisiphone, her black fumes fled,
and she in her own gore lay buried.
The Pilgrim cast his eyes behind, to know
From whose brave Hand she had received this blow:
W^ere he beheld a Virgin, at whose Feet
All other Graces had took up their seat, Charity.

And she as Queen of all the rest up stood
As a tall Ced^r among the underwood.
Both Hope, and Faith before her humbled were,
And did not scorn part of her Train to bare,
A Garland crowned her Brows, her Golden tresse
Tied up, through a laun Caul its Beams did press,
Which Rays about her sacred Visage spread,
So that always both Light, and Heat she had.
Her garments loose about her were; a flame
Of harmless (...) seemed to issue from the same,
And of so bright, and gentle Nature, that
To be burnt by it, it a desire begat.
Her hand the Bow held, whereby she had slain
The foul Hag Envy, and dissolved her train.
A Quiver hung, by a A scarf.
Mitella tied
(Poudred with Opalls, and with azure died)
Under her left arm, where her arrows lay
Which nothing could excepting Envy slay,
Or suc^ like evil Beasts, she always would
Freely all others ills repay with Good.
Kind unto all, never provoked, and still
Loves all, 2 Cor. 13.
bears all things, and can think no ill.
An En^^gn then, where she her self displayed
Sa^, she unto the Pilgrim gave, and said,
Let this your Standard be, to friend, and foe
This glorious Flag displayed ever show.
For who wants this, let him have what he will,
The best and chiefest thing he wants still.
For this blessed Boon, when he his thanks had paid,
A farther progress in the Way he made.
Still stony 'twas, obstructing blocks still lay
At every turn, so that the tedious Way
Seems every step more troublesome to grow,
And when the end shall be, he does not know.
But least he tire, Dame Patience Patience.
whom he met
To bear him up her helping hand does set,
Stooping she went under the pressing weight
Of Crosses which upon her shoulders sat.
And yet she does not murmur; if you will
Lay more, she will bear the same with Patience still.
Her feet were gal'd with Travel, not an oh!
Or wry-distorted lip escapes her tho,
Perched on her arm a gnawing Vulture stood,
Yet she but smiled to see her Crimson blood
Run circling thence; her fair-spread forehead, where
Nor rag^ nor frowns did ever dare to appear,
Was Crowned with Rocket: in her eyes serene
Skies, in her Face perpetual calmes were seen.
Three leaves she from her Crown plucks, baulmed with
The sovereign Medicine of her constant breath,
She to the Pilgrim gav't; this Antidote
He takes, Impatience is strait forgot,
And though the Way does rugged still remain,
He with a quiet Soul endures the Pain.
And now unto this rugged way inured,
It seems not difficult to be endured,
Pleasure from labor grows; more Joy he has,
And more it grows the farther he does pass.
Rocks seem but pibbles, Pibbles scruples show,
These could at first; those cannot hinder now:
For whatsoever opposes in his Way
He it with the humble Earth does equal lay.
What sharp at first seemed, now seems sweet, Joy grows
The farther in this rugged way he goes:
Which is so pleasing, and such Comfort brings,
That thus its sweetness in this Hymn he sings.
The world.
Adonian Gardens I despise,,
These rugged Rocks more please mine eyes,
The way of self-denial and mo^nification.
This ruder path which leads to
Jerusalem, surpasses you.
The Cross.
These Thorns, and bushes have more power
To comfort than your Iuly-flower:
The pleasures of the world.
Your Pinks, and Roses bow their heads,
Unto these rough, and stony beds.
This walk of flints sha'n't come behind
Your smooth-rowl'd ones of sifted sand.
Poor Walks! you please the Sense; The Mind,
And Soul of Man here pleasures find
The Waters which from Rocks spring here,
I to your Marble Founts pr^fer:
And Nymphs I have, which more do please
Than your Caerule Naiades.
Fair Groves of Pines, fair Beaches spread
Like Canopies to ward my head;
Christalline brooks, sweet Meadows, find
Green Arbours of sweet Eglantine:
Walks where the Roses sweetly smell,
Couches of Musk, and Camomill;
And what some'r you yield, I find
In the content of mine own mind.
My soul was pleased once with you,
But I do find the difference now;
You to my sense did pleasure yield,
But here with Ioys my soul is filled.
I by experience now must own
This Cross is better than your Crown.
O blessed Cross by thee a Crown I^gain!
O blessed Way I here find Joys in pain!
And now this narrow Path, this Rocky Way
Is entertained with delight, and Joy,
Pleasures, and high content he finds in this,
And Bliss receives in the Way to Bliss:
Nor Stone, nor Rock now in his Way does sit,
But he or moves it, or crawles over it:
And what somever Vigilantia spies
That may annoy him he o'rcomes or flies.
But yet the Tempter will not leave but tries
And makes use of all his policies,
And like Vertumnus puts on every shape
Rather than Man his cursed gripes should escape.
Our Pilgrim now before his watchful eyes,
A glittering Mountain in the Way espies;
A Cross it spread, and just as he must pass
Both sides the Way by it obstructed was,
He must take notice often, for like the Sun
It with a bright ref^lgent Beauty shon.
Indeed there lay the glories of the East,
The Earth's choice Beauties there his eyes did feast:
Decan had Diamonds sent, and Guine gold,
Peru its silver; Pegu thither rould
Its Rubies; Pearl, and (...) sent the Seas,
Tanian Emraulds; Byrils Euphrates.
Onyxes, Opals, Ind, and Arabie
Iaspers, and Saphyrs, Cyprus, Cyane:
What ever was counted precious there was found,
And with exuberance the Mountains Crowned.
Next Riches, Honors lay, by heaps were seen
The Robes of State, with Purple, Crimson, green,
And Tyrian Scarlet, lyn'd; Promotions
To every Gown, and every Cap belongs;
Gay pomp lay next, where bombycinian twine
The labor of self-pris'ning worms did shine,
Tincted in various colors cut in shapes,
And fitted for the various minds in Apes.
Here Pride his wardrobe had, and Lust his shop,
Where Musk, and Ambergris lay horded up:
Pleasures, and Earth's delights lay also there,
The Palat's pleasures rarest Cates appear;
The Brain's delight Books, mounted too on high,
And what somever objects please his eye:
And what delight the Earth affords, and what
Earth's sons could wish, were blended here, and that
With plenty, made a massy Mount, and spread
A cross the P^lgrim's path, To Heaven its head
It reared up; and for a while amazed
The busy Pilgrim, who upon it gazed.
But whilst his eyes read Lectures of delight,
The Mountain seems to travel with a sp'rite,
And opening at last its gaping womb,
A twy-fac'd Hag does from its intrai^'s come: Deceit.

Her right hand held a Magic Wand, with which,
She pointed to the Mountain, and her speech
Directed to the gazing Pilgrim thus.
O Pilgrim; Whither travel'st thou? Where does
These Riches grow? the Honors? Pleasures? Pomps?
(On which he that this vile Way travels stompes)
Where are they but upon this Earth? Behold!
These ^emms, this Silver, and this sulpid Gold,
These Pleasures, Hono^rs, S^lken garments, and
These Ca^es, that all attend upon thine hand,
Are not these rare? and wo^ld they not invite
A Prince's eye? and sur^et with d^light
All their Spectators? Where do think there may
Be ^ound, than these afford, a greater Joy?
Is ^t not pity such things should be lost,
That of the best, and highest pleasures boast?
Is It not a crime for ^o desert such Gemms?
Is Not he a Fool that such things disesteems?
V^ew but their luster, there is no other need
To speak, that does their wo^th and value plead.
Why speak I thus to thee? Do not thou know?
All these things thou about to leave art now:
This (...) Way leads from the Earth where dwell
These Rarities you see, and does excel
What ever you may hope to have; ^ools that
Leave what is certain for they know not what!
And thou art one; thou do already find
An asper-way: know thou what is behind?
Had Heaven desired Pilgrims, not the worst
Way, but the best he would have showed first.
Pray view their Beauties once again; ar'n't you
Quite ravished with their luster? Tell me true.
Nay, why such frowns? are you displeased then?
You do mistake me, hear me once again,
You think I Would have you Heaven desert for these,
It seems you w'ont: But hear me if you please:
I Will but propound a question unto you;
Why may not you have these and Heaven too?
You are a Saint; what then? Is God unjust?
Then wicked men alone Earth's Riches must
Enjoy? Shall God open his Cabinet
Of nature, and his choicest Riches set
Before the Wicked that Blaspheme his Name,
And only them? At least the Saints the same
Privilege may enjoy. Nature does pout
To hear you thus make her a prostitu^e^
She that has made the Saints her only heirs,
The wicked share not, what they have's not theirs:
The Saints it is: They rob the Saints: I moan
To see your folly. Cheated from your own!
Nay worse! To think them hurtful ills, and make
That bad which God made good, and for your sake.
Would God, o^'s Handmaid Nature, such bright gemms
Created have^ and with so glorious beams
Of Light, and Beauty given them, for to be
Temptations to his Saints, Heavens Progeny?
Or rather was it not, ^to ty^ifie
By these the luster they shall bear on high?
The end of their Creation then for them's;
They then despise God's Gifts who do his Gemms.
Is the intellect of Man (by which a Man
We only from the Bruits distinguish can)
A wicked thing? if wicked I have done,
And those that think so, surely they have none. See these objections^
answered, page
If good, then good it must produce; this Lace^
Of Gold, this Gown, these hoods, this brodered case,
It did find out; the Honors, Arts, and what
You see, at first invented was by that;
And more it daily does invent. If these
From good proceed, why they the Saints displease?
Why rather did not God make Man a Beast,
When by his understanding he is oppressed?
And why does it still use invention,
If It only be for his destruction?
Review these glitterin^ things: what harm does there
That you despise them thus, in them appear?
They Are neither Wolves, nor Bears; nor will they bite,
That you stand's if you scared were a^ their sight.
Here take your choice, choose what you will; you may
Take Gemms, take ^ewels, then keep on your Way:
These are not heavy, put them on and see
How like an Angel then a Saint will be.
Bright Alethia all this while stood by, Truth^

Her Beauties hiding from the Pilgrim's eye:
But now displaying of her splendid beams^
Veiled all the brightness of the Mount, and Gemms;
Like (...) T^ta^ stepping from a cloud
Wherein he did but now his Beauties shroud.
Her beams by faced D^ceit de^ect, and showed
Her double-tongue from whence s^' her venom spewed.
But to our Pilgrim from her sacred tongue
Where Hibla dwel't, these admonitions sprung.
See thou this Hag, this Pharmacentria?
Who with her charms seeks to oppose thy way
To Bliss, and to felicity, indeed
Throughout the World her crafty Magic's spread,
And dressed like me the Worlds vast stage she walks,
Feigning my voice, and gestures when she talks,
By her I often have been abused, and she
By simple hearts admitted is for me:
An innocent Lamb they judge her by her skin,
But she a ravening Wolf is found within.
My words she with her lies does mix, that so
Blended, none may the one from the other know;
This is the Hag that would your Journey let,
By this vain mount o^ Dust, which here is set^
And what is the World? its Riches? Honors? Pleasures^
Compared to one grain of Heaven's better Treasures?
There Is no comparison that is fit enough,
The one AEternal, th'o^her mortal stuff.
No joys, no pleasures, but they mixed are,
A grain of them, an ounce of Grief, and Care.
And as for Riches vainer than the rest
They be, by them your trouble is increast:
Honors, and Pleasures, Riches in excess
Had you, Death spoileth all your happiness.
They are fine things indeed for grovelling Souls,
Who dare not rear their Thoughts above the Poles,
But those that once a taste of Heaven have had,
Thinks these things vain, and their desires mad,
This World, and what it does afford esteem
The Packthread to bind up the purchased Gemm. M^t. 6. 33.

They Heaven seek first, and then the World is given,
But Crab-like Men Earth first, then seek for Heaven.
Defy Deccit then, let her Hag-ship know
Thou scornest all her Treasures here below,
And that thou bear such a noble mind
To 'count them chaff that flies before the Wind,
And at thy feet Earth's honored Crowns to spread,
Whilst to the Heaven's thou rear'st thy lofty head.
Heaven's Road's first paved with Pain, at last with Bliss:
Hel's last with Pain, at first with Pleasures is
Ah! sly Dece^t that Heaven, and Earth would join,
When they were severed by a Hand divine,
For who has Earth must Heaven forego, Mat. 19. 24.
and who
Heaven will enjoy, Earth must not cover too.
Can he be worthy of Heavens happiness,
That will not Earth leave that he may't possess. Mat. 10. 37.

Nor is All-mighty God unjust, in that
Earth's dross he to the Saints prohibits. What^
Does he not know what is best? He gives this Law
Because he knows how apt the World's to draw
Their minds from their Great God: Nor does the stain
In Nature's Beauties, nor in Earth remain:
But in Man's own depraved mind, it is he
That turns what is pure, into impurity.
Man's Intellect not evil is, it is true
God did it Good create, but yet there is few
But do abuse his Gifts; for whilst that they
Such useless things invent, they should display
Their understandings in the highest Sphere,
Far from the reach of Earth; Behold they there
Should the bright Eye of his Divinity:
And would they fall from that Sublimity,
Nature his Book they should have read, abound
His mighty Wonders there they would have found.
But (...) spreading his most subtle trains
With subtilty, and Craft has filled the brains
Of Man; so that his Wit is bu^ied still,
In leaving Good, to find out Toys, and Ill.
Therefore the Saints may well displeased be
With what ^' invents for useless vanity.
Beastly Deceit! though Man's Invention,
Prove oft-times means to his Destruction,
The Fault's not God's, but wicked thine, the Devil,
And's self; God made The In^ And tellect*
it very Good, you evil;
And he must it reduce again ever he
Enjoy can the bright Crowns of Purity.
Nor are Saints cheated from their own; what can
In all the Earth be rightly claimed by Man?
Is not it all the Lords? may not he then
As it shall please him, give it unto Men?
Do wicked men possess the Earth, their gain
Of that at last shall but augment their pain.
What if it be the Saints by right? shall they
If God requires to leave it not obey?
He does, Luke 14. 33.
and knows what he does, they must
Forsake that dross, and unto Heaven thrust;
All must be left for Heaven, Hearts must be loo^'d
From Earth, therefore Deceit has you abused,
To make you think it is your right to wear
Earth's Beauties on your back, or to appear
So glorious: Thou would appear to me
More Luci^er, than Angel for to be.
How prodigal Deceit is of her store!
But thou this Mount despise must, and be poor,
Desie Earth's Riches: 'Till from Heavens blessed done
Thou do receive them, then they are thine own.
When Heaven adorns thee with Earth's pride, then thou
Shall like an Angel truly shine below,
Thou then shall honor God, and every gemm
Shall glory but to touch thy Garments hem:
All what thou do here in thy passage meet
To stop thy way; shall tumble at thy feet:
No power have they then to hurt: And thou
Regard them shall no more than dunghills now.
'Till then thou leave them must, and follow the
Most rare Example of Humility.
With that she from her sacred Bosom drew
A Picture, and repos^d it to the view
Of the Caelestial Traveller, where one
The best skill in the Graphic Art had shown:
The Pencil guided by some hand divine,
Had there trick't out the fruitful Palestine,
Had showed Iu^aea, and Jerusalem,
The famous Temple, Iordan's Crystal stream,
All G^l^ee, the Hamlet Nazareth,
And Bethlehem, where God in flesh had Birth.
His Life, his Miracles, his Death, and where
He ^uried was, was rarely portrayed there.
Be^old (said Alathia) here is the story
Of the great King of Meekness, and of Glory,
Who clothed himself with mortal flesh, and blood,
And shed the same to do poor sinners good.
This is the Pattern of Humility
View this fair Copy, thou the ectype be:
Consider the immensity of Love,
Past the poor reach of Man, and far above
His most capacious thoughts to Comprehend
The depth of it, which to the very end
Of AEternity does reach, Immensity
Of Love, and Oceans of Humility.
With pious reverence turn here thine eye,
Thy Savior view in's Infant Majesty,
See how Heaven smileth in his eyes, what Grace
Already beameth in his sacred Face!
Those Rays divine though vaild with flesh, and blood,
Break through their Closure, and make bright their Cloud.
O depth of Meekness! O great Caesar's fling
Your Crowns, and stately Robes aside: The King
Of great Olymp^s, and of all the Earth,
Humility does ^each you by his birth.
See where he lies, his high-roof'd Chamber is
A despicable Stable; look how this
Poor Crib supplies a Cradle's place; you see
No gilded Cradle; here no Couches be.
This Hay (grown soft by's sacred touch, does own
A happiness) serves for a bed of Down.
The Crib's hard side a pillow is, alas!
His Chamber-fellows are the Ox, and Ass.
Darkness surrounds the Earth, and whilst it is hur^d
Through Hearts as well as Eyes, into the World,
The Sun of Righteousness does come, it is he
That Day, and Light, and Sun to all must be.
His Winter too, snow hangs on every bough,
Tearts had their Ice, their ^nows, and Winter too,
But in the midst of Hyems is the King
Born that to Hearts, and to the World's the Spring.
See Where his Mother the blessed Virgin on
Her bended knees does wait upon her Son.
Naught but Humility can here be seen,
In all the World's great King, and Earth's blessed Queen.
See where the Virgin Mother (...) about
His sacred limbs, a clean, but homely clout:
You see no Tyrian-ti^cted mantle there,
Shining with Gold, no useless Vailes appear,
Brode^'d with Lace; a piece of homespun cloth,
Is Va^l, is Mantle, Rug, and Blanket both.
For lack of better A^as, see where spreads
Upon the walls, busy Arachne's threads:
See with what pains that careful Animal,
With her best art labors to hang the Wall.
Naught but Humility can here be seen,
In all the World's great King, and Earth's chaste Queen.
Although this birth with so much lowliness
Accompan'ed, simplicity express,
And of small value seem to ambitious Earth,
Heavens Choresters rejoicing at his birth
S^ng this Antiphona: Salvation is
Come unto Man by this blessed Genesis!
Whilst others answer with a high-tun'd voice,
Rejoyc O Earth! both E^^^h and Heaven rejoice!
Salvation now is come to you below,
At Jesu's Name all hea^ts and knees shall bow!
Whilst thus his great Name the Caelestial Quire
R^sound, his mystic Birth they all admire,
AE^ernity before, nor ever shall
Again, a Wonder see so mystical.
The AEternal God takes humane flesh, and blood,
And all what Man has, sin excepting had.
O Wonder! wonderful indeed it is;
The greatest Wonder^ ^ ever told was this.
His and was to redeem fallen man, but you
May see his Life to be ex^^plar too.
O ^io^s lowliness! See where he stands
To be Baptized by John's less worthy Hands;
See how the Crystal Streams his Limbs do kiss,
From whence they take a far more purer Bliss.
And if that any stains they have, from thence
The sacred touch of his blessed flesh does rince
Them clean; see how part of those gentle Streams,
Loath to depart are changed to Crystal Gemms,
Which from his skin receive their luster, they
Melt into Tears when that they glide away.
You see no glaring Gold, no gaudy Lace
Upon his back, no Pedlars shops embrace
His Holy wast; one seamlesse Coat supplies
(To hide his Beauties from prophaner eyes)
All Ornaments. O single Poverty!
The Winged inhabitants of air, they be
Not destitute of Nests, the Foxes they
Have Dens, but he whereon his Head to lay Luke 9. 58.

Has not a place; Heaven and Earth's great Lord,
Earth don't the favor of a Home afford.
Now view his Court, they like himself are clad, Matthew chapter 10. v. 9, 10.

Two coats, two scrips, two pair of shoos forbad
They were; poor Fisher men, such chose he, they
Happy forsake the World, themselves deny
All things: The sinners, and the Publicans
Are oftentimes made his Companions.
The Supercilious Scribe, and Pharisee,
Scorn him, and he his blessed Company
Denies to them, their Pride, and wickedness,
Are opposite to 's Worth, and lowliness.
See here the mirror of Humility,
See where he humbly on his knees does lie,
And though he Lord be, yet ^e thinks it meet
For our example, to wash clean the Feet
Of his Disciples, the slaves office thus
He takes, who is Lord over the World, and us.
See where he does his Body break: O that
You had but eyes to see the blessed meat
He gives under those Elements of Bread,
And Wine: His Body and his Blood is shed
Thereby into their Souls; though from your eye
It Is hid, he gives his blessed Humanity.
They on his Body feed, and I must tell
You, here he wrought a mighty Miracle.
All those who truly do receive this sood,
Do feed upon his Body, and his Blood,
Not by a notion? really they do,
A Sacramen^ indeed; yet known to few.
The mirro^r of all Pa^ience see: he that
The Angels thought a Happiness to wait
Upon, and at whose Call ten Legions would,
His foes have into thousand pieces pulled,
Is bound, and fettered; see what Majesty
Reigns in his eyes mixed with Humility.
See with what meekness he does turn his cheek,
Whilst it the wicked multitude do strike:
See how he bears their buffets; where they spit
Upon his Face, ^ see how he bears it
Speaks not a word, but rather pitties them,
Who slay their own Souls in their mu^thering him.
See where they mock him, how they press the blood
With a Thorn'd-Crown from out his sacred Head:
See how they scourge him here, the Crimson stream
Blushing to see their Rage reproves them.
See how the whole Worlds sins are on him thrown,
A spotless Lamb, who guilty is of none:
But see their wickedness increased, lo here
He 's Crucified; see how the cursed Spear^
Pierces his blessed side, O sacred spring!
Which does Health, Life, and to all Salvation bring.
Will they accept of it, this stream does run
Not for a few to sip, but every one
Here drench his lips may, without price all may
Drink of this stream, which from his side does flow:
See how it runs, how plentiful; the Blood
Flows through the whole World, and becomes a flood.
Christ died for all; that Dogma is untrue
Which says he died but for a very few:
And those elected (partially) by God
Before or Time, or Man had their abode.
O st^ange! Shall God to Life some few Elect,
And all the Wo^ld besides (O hard!) reject?
Thus says the wicked then: If God has chose
Me unto Life, I cannot Salvation lose,
Let me live how I will: If good I be
If I Am rejected I no Heaven shall see.
I Will take my swing in wickedness, for I
As God decreed has, shall or Live, or dye.
It Is true God from Eternity foresaw
Who should be damned, and saved, but that no Law
On such imposed: then this Election
In Time is, does Conditionally run,
That they persever in Obedience,
And Faith, if not they then may fall from thence.
So all Elected are, not one debarred
From Life; who otherwise do think, a hard
And cruel master of the Lord make, rather
Than a most merciful, and Loving Father.
As God conditionally Elected All,
In the same manner was our Saviors fall
For every one: nor must it follow then
Because he died for all, therefore all men
Must saved be, it Conditionally is.
Suppose there were a Well so full of Bliss,
That all Diseases it would remedy,
And that it free for every one did lie,
It is employed, though 't be for every one
That it is for those that come, and those alone,
Effectually: It Is just that they who will
Not thither come keep their Diseases still.
Nor does God's Will depend on man's in this,
Because God Wills it so, God's Will it is.
This is that Living spring, whilst man remains,
This still shall flow to wash his fouler stains,
Without this he cannot be pure, nor come
Where Christ is to the new Jerusalem.
O blessed spring! Water of Life! here we
The highest words without Hyperbole
May use; O it is the blessed Nectar of
The holy Angels, and blessed Saints above.
His flesh is there Ambrosia; it is by this
We may attain an Apo^heosis.
By this blessed food all heavenly Souls are fed,
And through the Earth it does its Bounties spread:
Think it not strange, if those may feed on it too
Who live in India, and that never knew,
Or heard of this blessed Iesu's dying day,
Circumscribe not his flesh, and Blood I say,
No one without it can be saved: See p.
O damn
Not all that never heard that he died for them.
This Blood's a Living s^ring; poor souls impute
This to themselves, and yet themselves pollute
With beastly sins: His Blood has washed us clean
Cry they, and so continue in their sin.
O sad presumption! whilst they crucify
Christ in their Hearts, by's Blood we are saved to Cry!
I say His Blood's a Living spring, and your
Soul feed on's flesh must, drink his Blood most pure,
If that Salvation you intend to have,
It Is that believe me that alone must save!
What this his flesh, and Blood is, partly you
Do know the same, and shall more clearly too,
The farther in this way you go, it is that
That every pious Soul does animate.
It is a Sacrament tongues cannot express,
It Is Life, it is Virtue, Power, Holiness,
By it all things subsist, it penetrates
All things, all quickens, all things animates.
The Angels food, the same Humanity
That sits at God's right Hand, the same that the
Jews crucified, that 'rose again, and is
O^^ Propitiation it is the same it is this.
Thou see here his Life, and nothing there
Did in it without a mystery appear.
He bound was, spit upon, whipped, crucified,
Pierced with a Sphere thorough his sacred side.
Here Contemplate, all is That it signifies some great myst^rie: not but that
it was really acted and done upon the Earth and on the flesh of Jesus our
Savior.
mysterious, and
Man may by it his vast Love understand.
See here, where he gives up the Ghost, here thou
Upon the Wings of Contemplation now
May ride: O sacred Death! See where the Sun
Obscured is; how Rocks do rend in twain:
See how the Graves are opened; see where the dead
Arise: O this, this is the Day they did
So long expect; which often in days of old
The Prophets by their Prophesies foretold.
Now trembles Hell, now all the Devils quake,
Now suffers Luci^er, now Hell does shake:
For now the Light shuts up Hel's Center; now
The mighty Wrath of God is broken too;
Christ underwent it, and for mortal man
Through the envious Wrath made now a Path again.
He pierced the Principle of Wrath, and there
Love, Wrath, and Light all reconciled were.
O sacred Sacrament! these mysteries
Are hid, and strange to more prophaner eyes:
But I will more declare; attend and be
An Auditor unto no one but me:
I in the Scriptures dwell, there find you may
What I declare as clear, as is the Day.
When Adam fell in Paradise, O then
He 'wak'd the Wrath of God against all men
That should succeed, the Wrath then potent grew
And like a wall barred up the way unto
Blessed Paradise, all men excluded were,
And 'twas impossible to enter there.
This Adam saw too late; then was the seed
The blessed seed of the Woman promised,
Which should by being bruised in the Heel
Of Death, break Wrath's strong head, and make him feel
His mighty power: This Adam saw, and all
The Patriarchs, and Prophets, that (...)
This should; in this they all rejo^^d: thus saw
With joy old Abraham this blessed Day. John 8. 56.

The Zeal, and Justice of Jehovah, and
In which no man (but Christ alone) could stand
So Moses could not into Canaan bring

With joy, and with him enter Paradise,
Where they in Heaven remain. In Heaven he is,

And Heaven there is, and yet not the row the Skies.
T^^s Path ^ill lead thee th^^^er, thou shall know,

This is the Day all Saints do long to see.
Keep safe this Picture, and be sure that thou

These things which here are offered by Deceit
Are worth a grain of Dust, compared unto
Those Riches that in Paradise do grow.
Kick down Dec^it, and all her toys despise;
Follow thou Me I Will show thee Paradise.
Thus Alat^ia ends, the while his eyes,
The Pilgrim to the perfect Pattern ties,
On it they dwell; where they such sweetness found
That to a meditation so profound
And deep as may be, they his soul attract;
That Life so spotless, and so pure to act
He now desires, Christ now his Pattern is;
And in his steps he seeks after Bliss.
Whilst thus his busy eyes (...) to, and f^o,
On that which Ala^^^a did bestow
Upon him; all the circumambient air
Began to glow, and seemed all on fire.
The Pilgrim 'gan to feel the glowing heat
His Cheeks grew red, his Face, and Temples sweat,
About he looks, to see from whence it came,
When that he spies a Chariot all on flame
Which two swift Coursers drew, their flaming breath
Threatening to all that should oppose them Death.
With a Iehuan pace on wheels of speed
Down the next Rock Horses, and Chariot slide,
And up another ran, e'n to the top
Before hot Zelus could 's swift Coursers stop. Zeal.

Doubling their sturdy necks he back again
Inforces them, with much ado refrain
At last he did his furious Steeds, and from
His Chariot did unto the Pilgrim come.
His Robes were flames of fire, powdered with Hearts
Winged with flames, struck th'rough with flaming Darts,
His eyes a piercing ardor sent, his Hand
Bore both a steeled Lance, and flaming brand^
The Pilgrim he accosts, and easily got
With him to mount his flaming Chariot.
Now glows his heart, and now a Champion
For God he is, with sury he upon
Deceit does set; against the Mountain flings
His Spear, tramples upon her siner things,
Scatters her Gold, and silver; does despise
Her Honors, Dainties, Pleasures, Braveries.
Under his feet he tramples that at last
His flaming Brand amongst them all he cast,
The fire takes hold consuming them to naught,
The Mount it to a heap of ashes brought.
What? cries the Pilgrim, shall a mount of dust
To stop my passage unto Heaven, thrust
It self between me, and my God? so shall
This brand what ever opposes cause to fall.
Naught stand 'tween me and Heaven shall, if it do,
This Spear, this Brand, this hand shall make it ^ow.
The World, and all things I Will forsake, and I
Father and Mother also will deny,
And hate them too, Luke 14. 26.
if they opposers be,
And stand betwixt blessed Paradise, and me.
Heaven 's in my eye, its Beauties are my prize:
Heaven 's a Reward for him that Earth denies.
My Way I am resolved to make Good,
Although I stand up to the chin in blood,
A fire agitates my Limbs, and now
Both World and all things Zeal shall make to bow.
This said, he hurries up and down the Way,
His furious Steeds, cannot stand still, nor stay,
What ever appears the hot-spur'd Pilgrim now
Without examination makes to bow:
The furious Steeds over the Mountains fly,
Feeling the Reins loose on their necks to lie,
And ready to praecipitate their Guide,
Down the steep ridges of the Rocks they slide,
Sometimes they are in the Way, sometimes they are out,
Some^imes they backward run, sometimes about,
And over the Rocks, their heady co^^se they take:
Th'rough fire, and water they their voyage make.
The next Way that appears he takes; and what
He thinks is Good, others must bow to that.
This furious Course makes him to lose the Way,
And up and down at every turn to stray:
What ever he sees under his Censure comes;
As well in Iudg^m^^ts, as in Zeal he fumes.
But whilst with Zeal he runs up, and down,
A Matron met him, Prudence.
on whose awful frown
Sat a most comely Gravity, Serene,
And free from tempests, her clear face was seen:
Her eyes something of Majesty did bear,
And over hearts did sweetly domineer:
Her face enough of Beauty had; and she
In all her make bore a just symmetrie.
Her clothes were grave, and decent, neither were
They cut to all modes, nor yet singular.
Her pace was grave, in every thing she did,
A Dove, and Serpent, Mat. 10. 16.
seemed to be hid.
Her right hand bore a Dove, her left did hold
A Serpent, which i^s tail about her rolled.
Meeting the Pilgrim from his hands she took
The slack'ned reins, and thus her mind she broke.
S^^y zeal-sparr'd P^lgrim! if thou safe wilt be
Thou must commit the Reins of Zeal to me:
In this rough pa^^, and 'tween the Mountains, let
Me be your guide, least that you danger meet.
Zeal drives so fast, that he will quickly crr;
Unless my Dove, and Serpent draw the Carr.
Those who without me go, become forlorn,
Lose the right Path, prove to the World a scorn:
Cast Pearls before the snowts of Swine; and feed
The ravenous Dogs, with holy Childrens bread^
Dangers incur, which they might fairly shun,
Do what they by and by wish were undone.
Admit of me and I will be your guide,
I know which Way, how, where, and when to ride:
^rust me and I will bear you in my arms,
Untouched through the Multitude of Harms.
That Majesty which beamed in her Face
Constrained the Pilgrim to consent; a place
Upon his right hand for her he provides,
And now he soberly, and softly rides:
Prudence is joined with Ze^l: nor does this want
Its former hea^, but less extravagant,
By that is made. He who will rightly move,
Must first conjoyn the Serpent and the Dove.
Now safely goes our heavenly Traveller
Nor from this blessed (though rugged) path does err,
Nothing appears that may obstruct his^ Way,
But it he even with the Earth does lay.
Dame Vigilantia all about does seek
For ^s foes; which found Zeal does their powers break:
Conquers them quite, and by their fall does raise
Trophies of Honor, and immortal praise.
By halves God will not have his work be done:
Nor must those faulter who this Race do run.
Clean must the house be swept to find the groat:
All must be sold before the Pearl be bought.
No Delilah must shave thy Locks: but she
Must be overcome lest that she conquer thee.
Though thus far thou art gone, as yet there may
Some Delilah be left for to betray
Thee to thy foe; let Vigilantia find
Her out, then let Zeal all her powers bind,
And cast her from thee; whatsome'r it be
Thou 'rt loath to part with, Delilah's to thee:
But when she conquered is, faster thou '^t move,
On wings of speed, unto the Gates of Love.
Thus Vigilantia to our Pilgrim brought
His Del^lah, the which he little thought
For to have parted with; and must she dye
Cries he, who did within my bosom lie?
Yes, answered Zeal, God will with none dispense,
Slain on the Altar of Obedience
She must be ever we farther pass: she slain
He posteth forward without stop amain:
With full Carere he runs, and full of Joy
Leaves behind him all the rugged Way.
He enters now a place where all about
Light like the Sun, from bright Clouds issues ou^.
By this clear Light he now begins to see,
What hurtful rebels all the Passions be,
And how the Senses hurt; irregular
Affections also how they hurtful are.
Therefore he these now takes to task: and first
The Rebel Passions that oppose him durst
He conquereth; these now his slaves become
Who had so often Lorded over him.
He will not kill them quite^ because they may
Be useful to him, whilst they him obey^
Not merely Stoical; in order he
Keeps them: He 's Lord, and they his servants be.
Then all the Senses he does Regulate,
And their excursions wisely moderate:
Makes them to know that he is their Lord, and they
Are forced now his pleasure to obey.
Carnal affections stoop: These Crucify
He does, lest they should draw his mind awry.
Where he God's Image sees most, he there
Does his affections (as in justice) share.
By this same Light he also sees that he
Can in the Earth own no propriety;
All that he has he offers to the Lord
He 's but a Steward, and must nothing hoard
Contrary to his Master's Will; but here
P^udence directs him how his Goods to share:
Else subtle Satan would step in the while,
And with his tricks would him of all beguile.
By this Light also he espies his flesh
To be a Case made up of Earthly trash,
A prison to his Soul; now he espies,
Another Body in that Body lies:
The inward man, which as the outward dies,
Lives, gathers strength, and does in triumph rise.
This Body now he longs to attain,
And by the death of all things it to gain.
Now every motion opposite must die:
Flesh, and its Members he does crucify,
All things are sacrificed by Diligence
Upon the Altar of Obedience^.
The fleshly body every hour dies,
The sp'ritual does as fast in triumph rise.
He 's now diswedded from the World; He knows
He 's not to be now at his own dispose,
Therefore his Body, Soul, and spirit he,
Does consecrate to Heavens high Majesty.
All that he has to Heaven he offers, and
All he retains comes from its bounteous Hand.
Now joys surround him, Comfort is the Way,
Nor Night is seen, all is a mystic Day,
The Sun of Righteousness his brighter Beams
Displays, and th'rough his Heart his sweetest streams
Of brightness run: his spiritual foes stand off,
And dare not venture for a Counter-buff:
They tremble now, ^hastity^
and fear the world's grand tie
Will be assunder burst by Chastity;
For she appears unto the Pilgrim now,
Who to her feet his humble Head does bow^
Her eyes gave ^lames, as pure as those which lie
Beyond the blew Seas of the azu^e Sky:
Her countenance a brighter Light did grace,
Than that which ^hine^h in Diana's Face.
But when her virgin Lips she opened,
The incircling air with purity was spread;
Thither their Purple Wings the Turtles move,
To draw the ay^ in, of the purest Love.
The joining Corals happy Kisses break
She did: and thus did to the Pilgrim speak.
Hail happy Pilgrim! who thus far art from
Earth's durty soil, and foul pollutions come,
Not far thou art from the blessed City, but
Before thou thither come it is requisite,
That thee, and I should join; therefore receive
From me the Bounties that I daily give.
Unless thou with my Mantle covered be,
Thou never shall the heavenly Salem see.
Polluted eyes, polluted hearts, and hands,
Must not come there: Heaven will admit no stains.
Flesh must not enter Heaven; nor can you come
Clothed with that into the secret Room,
Where the grand Mysteries are revealed, by
Heaven's gracious Prince, the Son of Majesty.
The fleshes quickly-vanish'd pleasures foul
With spots the clothing of the purest Soul,
Spread clouds before her eyes, so that she may
Not see the brightness of the purest day:
And hang a Vail between her ^elmed eyes,
And the blessed Ark of sacred Mysteries.
It Is I that must make white the Soul, and that
Dark Cloud before her dull eyes dissipate:
It Is I must draw aside this Vail; it is I
That lead the Way to Heavens great Mystery:
Christ does all this by me; it is I that am
Sent for to woo the Soul from flesh to him.
I speak not now to those that are below,
But unto such who would desire to know
The highest secrets; who'd dull Earth forsake,
And would a lo^ty flight to Heaven make:
Who would converse with Angels, who would hear,
The Heavenly Music of the inner Sphere.
Who would the fruits of Paradise enjoy:
To such I speak; such must make me their Way.
The holy Angels who immortal be
Are clothed with the Robes of Puri^y,
Pure Chastity does crown their brows, now these
A ^pure, chaste Soul, and unpolluted ^ees,
With such they love for to Conve^se; but give
Their backs to such as do not chastely Live;
They cannot endure for to come near to those:
Chaste Souls they Love, their Love from likeness grows.
But it is not good that man should be alone
Without a Spouse; I have provided one
For thee therefore, therefore the flesh forsake,
And this into thy arms, and bosom take.
Lo here a draught of that blessed Face I spread,
To whom in time thou shall be married:
It is Sophia, she shall be thy Bride,
The Spouse of Christ, and all the Saints beside.
A Virgin she Eternal is, and I
From her blessed Gift receive all purity.
From her Arabia does her sweets receive^
She to the Lillies does their Candor give;
It Is she the Roses with those blushes dies:
The S^n his splendour (...) from her eyes:
The Silver Rivers do their Crystal owe
To her, from her their purity does flow:
^Tis she that does the Earth with beauties deck
^'th' Spring: and loads with fruit, and sheaves her neck
In The Autumn: she adorns the Trees with Leaves;
From her the Tulip all her gay receives,
All the rare Beauties that the World do grace,
Are the reflected shadows of her Face,
They fade away, but hers do never fade:
What is AEternal cannot be decaid
By Time: she still is young no wrinkles dare
Upon her everlasting brows appear.
The variegated Cloud-reflected bow,
Which does so many lovely colors show;
Earth's Gold, and Silver, and each brighter Gemm,
Do but adorn her Garments lowest hemm.
Her beauties are Caelestial, mortal eyes
Cannot see her; who beholds her beauty dies.
But thou the Picture of thy Spouse shall see,
Whom thou enjoy shall to AEternity.
She on his shoulders then her mantle throws,
Whiter than Lilies, or the Alpin snows,
Embrodered with Pu^ity, and round
About with Modesty, and Silence bound:
APOCALYPSIS, who did on her wait
She called, and bid her show the Image strait
Of high Sophia the unspotted Bride,
An azure Volumn her bright Hands untied,
And then unrouling it, the Pilgrim sees
Sophia's bright, and blessed Essigies.
Go now and travel all Earth's Countries over,
From Eastern Ind, to the (...) ^^ore,
Pick up the cream of Beauties, and from thence
(Adding those past) extract a quintessence:
Let now conspire in one Alchimechus,
Apelles, Zeux is, and Pha^^hasius,
Let their best skill be by their Pencils known,
And let the mirror of their Art be shown,
In the composure of a beauteous Face
That may all others living quite d^^grace.
And let their Brothers with Poetic skill
Surpass their Pencils with their better Quill,
Let them with Ink their Wonders show, (who make
Bright Heaven a luster from that blackness take)
In setting forth a Beauty, when all is done,
As rotten-shining Wood unto the Sun,
His Glorious splendour: so their works will be
To that rare piece our Pilgrim here did so^.
I dare not venture here for to depaint,
The Beauties of that Face; the World's too scant
To yield materials, and I words should want,
How can her all-surpassing Form be penned,
When her Idea none can comprehend?
The soul that sees her, feels her, and her worth
Is better felt than can be spoken forth.
The fulvid Gold which is esteemed so rare,
But the reflection of her golden Hair
Is; All the Silver did its brightness get,
And silveriz'd was when it touched her feet.
The Crystal Rivers were like Ink, she gave
Them clearness when she did her finger lave
In their dark streams: A drop fell from her Hand,
Which being gave to the clear C^ystals; and
The oriental Pearls. She looked upon the Sun
And ever since she with that splendour shon.
She glanced her eye upon the Night's fair Queen,
She caught that glance, ever since she fair has been.
A spark flew from her Heavn'ly eye, it seems
Tellus snatched that which essence gave to Gemms.
The air permitted was to kiss her Hand,
Who ever since its sweetness has ^etain'd.
Over the Globe stood black triumphing Death,
Till she but tasted of her sacred breath,
Prolific strait she was, and from her womb
Oceans of Herds, of Trees, of Herbs did come.
By it still all things live: The Pink, the Rose
And each sweet Flower that on Tellus grows,
Receive from her their odoriferous Fumes,
Which emanation from her Body comes.
Some of her Beauty down she flung below
Which all things caught that now do Beauty show.
Roses and Rubies which do rarely shine,
Are but umbrella 's to her lips divine:
Those Seas of Claret in the azure Skies
Seen, when bright Sol down in the Ocean lies,
Or Tyrian blushes, if you them compare
To what buds in her cheeks mere deadness are:
As far below the Beauty and the Bliss
Seen there, as Earth to the highest Heaven is.
How can a Pen, or Pencil then depaint
Her; without whom all things do beauty want!
Her own hand 'twas that thus her self did limn,
And by APOCALYPSIS sent it him.
On this attracting Face our Pilgrim throws
His eyes, his Soul through those windows goes,
With so much joy that all her ^aculties
Intentively assembled in his eyes,
All other pa^ts left destitute; in this
Capital City Oculipolis
The So^l and all her train are seated; by
That Beauty drawn into an Ex^asie.
Whil^t greedily with gazing eyes he ^eeds
Upon the Beauties of that Face, there speeds
Do^n from the Poles, a Heavenly Bow-man, who
The ^umid Ether all the Way he show
Warmed with a gentle heat: His Silver Wings
The Row the calm aequor of the air he swings.
A pleasant spring upon his Face did bud,
His head was shadowed with a golden Wood:
In either Cheek the Roses white and red,
Scarlet and snows symmetrically spread^
His eyes two pleasant stars, whose a^^ects were
More pleasing than Venus or Jupiter.
A chain of Saphyrs bound his Ivory neck^
A snowy Mantle which gold Stars did deck
Hung on his shoulders, and enclosed his wast,
A gilded Quiver at his back tied fast
Was; one hand with a silver Bow was filled,
He under the other arm a prisner held.
Chastity's Cupid 'twas, who went to fetch
At her Command the Spurious C^pria^ wretch:
And catching him dealing his wanton da^ts,
On spor^ful youths, and Courtly Ladies hearts.
He hither brought him by Commandment
Of 's Mistress, to give him his punishment:
Being he was her chiefest foe, and had
His bainful poisons on her Virgins shed.
^he, daigning not on him her eyes to cast,
Bid her chaste Cupid slash his want^n wast.
Binding his Hands (that often had prisners made)
With his own Sca^^ he to a Tree him tied:
Robbing a (...) of its boughs, a Rod
He ^^de^ and soundly whipped this wanton God.
He flayed his back, and with his wanron blood
Died all the grass in 'Crimson where he stood.
Then broke his bow, and arrows; His fine Quiver
And Crown of Roses flung into the River.
This done he let him loose: since which disgrace
He never was seen to come anear this place.
Lost in the Face which he did contemplate
O^r P^lgrim was, nor would he extricate
Himself and if he could: He never did prize
enough before, the blessing of his eyes;
Ravished he was; but blessed CHASTITY
Spoke to her CUPID with her speaking eye;
He understood the Dialect; and drew
A Golden arrow from his Quiver: Blew
The Feathers were, the point was living flame,
This notch'd in 's silver Bow, he took his aim
Like a good Archer of the Pilgrim's heart,
And th'rough the same he shot the flaming dart.
A gentle Fire, and sweetly glowing heat
The Pilgrim feels; his quicker pulses beat;
The Row his Limbs the living flames do spread,
With pleasures joined not to be uttered.
No blood ran from the Wound, he feels no smart,
Although the shaft had cleft in two his Heart:
Those flames made Wounds of Joy: healed those of pain,
Dispel'd all ills, did Life, and Health retain.
A constant ardor now burns in his Breast,
Being with the immortal fire of Love possessed:
And wholly swallowed up in them, he fryes
In pleasing Flames: becomes Heavens Sacrifice.
He lives in Flames; but they are chaste flames of bliss:
He is in Love: but with SOPHIA it is.
Is not it madness to indulge a Foe?
Do men cry when they from their prisons go?
Do men love chains, and fetters to suppress
Their eager flight unto their Happiness?
Yea, sure they do all this, who here do move
In chains of flesh: and do such prisons love.
The freeborn soul, were it not chained below,
Above the Stars its nimble Fires would throw.
See all the World at once, and swiftly run
About the Heavens, and clearer than the Sun.
Had not the Pilgrim had a fleshly case,
He longer might have seen SOPHIA'S Face:
Alas! our Souls enchain'd to Dust, and Nigh^,
Cannot behold the splendors of that Light
Too strong for flesh, and blood; Whose flames will be
To flesh, as love proved once to Semele.
Our eyes without apparent hurt cannot gaze
Against the Sun: Nor can those heavenly Rays
Of high Beatitude the Soul see here
Married to flesh, long, 'cause that cannot bear
The Soul's high flight, but that she suffers, so
She holds the Soul, lest she should from her go.
Apocalypsis well man's frailty knew,
Therefore she blessed Sophia's Face withdrew,
And veiled it from the Pilgrim's eyes: To whom
Thus Chastity; whose words flew in perfume.
Is not one glimpse of thy Caelestial Bride
More glorious than all the World beside?
Did ever taste in those dull stream^ of Bliss
The World affords, a pleasure like to this
Thou have received by a Vision? then
How far more great will it be! how ample! when
Thou full fruition shall enjoy! and be
Blessed with her Blisses to AEternity!
When that thy Soul, clothed with immortal Day,
Has shaken off these shackling Robes of clay!
In Vailes she now is forced to appear,
'Cause Flesh c^nnot her ample Beauty bear.
See that she only Mistress of thy Heart
Remain; for she 'l not be content with part:
Thou must not share it 'tween Mortality
and Her, she 'l bear no such indignity.
If ever Mistress Hearts entire deserved,
If ever to be punctually served,
It Is she: see then (although thou can not merit
One grain of what thou shall by her inherit)
That thou prove faithful to her Love, and she,
Hers, with Heavens Kingdom, will return to thee.
Down bows the Pilgrim to the ground his Breast,
And in these Words his constancy expressed.
I know my frailty, and my weakness, and
That I alone, and of my self can stand
Not one poor moment: By the help of Grace
Supported: First the Sun shall change his Face
And glorious splendour into pitchy Night;
Flames first shall cease for to ascend upright:
The brinish Seas shall over Atlas flow,
The Vine and Olive in Asphaltes grow.
First Sol shall rise out of the Western main,
And in the Iapon Sea his flaming Wain
At evening drench: December shall be May:
And Trees in June shall sheets of snows d'splay:
Noon shall be Night; Nature inverted be,
Before I yield unto Inconstancy.
Before I leave her whom my Soul has chose,
And her forgetting, to another close.
Those ardent flames which now surround my Heart,
Will so dispose me that I never shall start
From her to whom whilst in this flesh I breath
I do my Life, Heart, Acts, thoughts all bequeath.
O noble Resolution! which does move
From those bright flames of Zeal, and ardent Love!
Hell trembles when he hears the inspired tongue
Of valiant Souls resolved, to speak such strong
Hel-battering Words, such sounds do quickly go,
Both to the Angels, and the Devils too;
Piercing both Worlds, sound quickly in their ears,
Fill those with Joy, these with disturbing Fears.
If the dull flames of the Idalian brat,
In tired Souls most strangely operate;
Making them bow unto their Idol-toy
That from her presence they receive no Joy:
And 'count the pleasures of a Crown less bli^^e,
Than those they gain when they her Lips do kiss:
If they so strangely Man can alter, so
As for to make him all the World forego,
For this one Idol, never feeling ease
Longer then while he does his Mistress please.
Does she but frown, Hell, nor AEternal Night
In their worst shapes could scarce so much affright
The trembling Lover; for her wrinkled brow
More terrible than does Avernus show.
It Is not her power he fears: But yet he can
Not disobey; Love's a Magician.
If by his power men dare to undertake
The hardest things, and nothing of them make,
If for their Loves their Lives they will venture, and
Be proud to spill their blood at their Command;
Dye if they bid them, if such Love can cause
So great obedience to his giddy Laws:
If by his hidden, and abstrucer Art,
Knowledge he does to ignorants impart,
Make Clowns prove Eloquent, nay Po^ts too:
If thus, and much more this blind-God can do,
What shall that Love do, unto which this seems
As the worst Pibbles to the best of Gemms?
That Love divine whose fires immortal be?
Whose constant Pleasures never changes see?
That Love immense which fills to the brim
Capacious Souls? where may whole Oceans swim
Of Joys divine, unutterable? then
Shall not this draw Obed^ence from Men?
Shall not this sweeten whatsoever may seem
Bitter? make easy what is hard to them?
Fear can do much, but Love much more can do:
Fear false obedience gives: Love just and true.
Heaven's Pilgrim now with these diviner flames
Possessed, h' alone to please Sophia aims;
Love regulates him, now it is not for fear,
That he to her such reverence does bear^
From Love it is his Obedience springs, and that
The slavish fears of Hell does terminate.
Now all things easy are; no Seas can stop,
Nor Mountains: those he swims, and these climbs up.
Now in his breast a strong attraction he
Feels draw'ng him up to Heaven continually.
Now constant ardors burn within his Breast,
And flames of Love give rest in his unrest^
He feels most blessed Enthean heats surprise
His soul, which make 't a living sacrifice.
A pleasing Tincture the row his Body flows,
And like a Flower in Paradise he grows.
All sorrows now are banished down to Hell;
He nothing does but Joys, and Raptures feel.
The Seraphims indite some sacred Song,
Which they decant by his Hymniferous Tongue;
And modulating too those heavenly Lays
His Harp, an Angel by his Fingets plays.
Under the Covert of the Angels Wings,
By Love inspired, aloud this Song he sings.
Go Gnedian Idols spend your darts,
On all Luxurious, pruriant Hearts!
A nobler shaft has pierced mine,
Which flames with Fires more divine.
You may now shoot but shoot in vain
Such ^ha^ts my Heart shoots back again.
My eyes your Venom cannot receive,
Heaven's Queen a Remedy did give.
Her Beauty dwells in my eyes,
I therefore you, and yours despise.
Fair Ladies all your Beauties spare,
For in my eyes they sullied are,
I Styx see in a Hellens Face
Now I have seen a Deitesse.
You Cyprian Lovers now no more
Your beauteous Images adore!
Cease now your fond Idolatry,
Speak no more Lovers blasphemy:
Fling in the Fire your wanton Lays,
Which blushes in chaste Cheeks do raise:
Cease your Encomiums, your bliss
Mere mortal dust, and ashes is:
A wrinckled Baucis all the while
The glory wears of your high Style:
Let fairer Souls a Godesse please,
Whilst Bacca's join with Thyrsites.
Had you but seen my heavenly Bride,
Youl'd count all beauties dung beside,
And cease to idolize a Face
Where white, and red 's the chiefest Grace.
But my blessed Bride SOPHIA, is
Both Queen of Beauty and of Bliss.
Her Face shines clearer than the Sun,
In his bright Chariot at Noon.
Her Crystalline eyes are the glass,
In which themselves the Angels dress:
The Beams that comes from her eyes
Give Light to Heaven, and Paradise.
Her ears the Seats of Judgments are,
Immortal Fortitude her hair;
Her Brows of highest Majesty:
High Wisdom in her mouth does lie.
It Is by her words the Angels Live,
Her Breath does Life immortal give:
The beaming glory in her cheeks,
With splendour Heavens high Palace strike^.
A Diadem her brows do tie
Of Bliss and Immortality.
Her sacred breasts the Fountains be
Of Joy, and true Felicity;
Amb^osia does thence proceed
The Heav'ly Manna, Angels bread;
Water of Life blessed Nectar streams
Thence, clearer than the Crystal ge^ms,
In which as through Heaven it slips
The Angels drench their Rosy Lips.
Her arms, the Angels do enfold;
Her Hands immortal Blessings hold:
Upon her knees does Pity sit,
And Goodness clothes her Legs, and F^^t.
Her Garments are of Light divine,
Which brighter than the Sun do shine:
The blew, and starry Carpet's spread
For her blessed Feet upon to tread,
Whose blessed touches pur^^ie
The Body of the Crystal Sky.
Such is my Bride, and now who dare
With my Bride's beauty theirs compare?
Sacred SOPHIA! it is in thee
I place all my Felicity:
Blessed with thy sight; all things below
Do very much deformed show.
I cast my eyes to thee above:
Ah I am even sick of Love! cant.

Comfort me with thy fruit divine!
Stay me with Flagons of thy Wine!
Ah let me banquet now with thee,
And spread thy Banners over me!
Thou art the Rose of Shar^n, thou
A Lily in the Vale does grow;
Thou a^t more fair than is the Sun;
Thy Garments smell of Lebanon.
My eyes unto thy Face I move:
Ah I am overcome with Love!
That Fire of Love which flows about
My heart, whole Seas cannot put out.
Not the black fear of dreadful Hell,
To be obedient does compel:
Nor now those torments to eschew
Enforces me to follow you,
It is from thee, and not from thence,
That springs my obedience.
It Is Love of thee, not Fear of Hell,
Which me to serve thee does compel.
It Is not Heavens blessed Joys that move,
Or do entice me to this Love;
It is not Heavens high Crown, that draws,
It Is Love alone a stronger cause.
Not Heavens high Blessings I regard,
I Love thee not for a Reward;
Fling me to Hell, and if you will,
Yet will I Love SOPHIA still.
These flames which kindle in my brea^^
Shall never out until I rest
Within thy bosom, and there be
Enclosed to AEternity.
Thus chaunts SOPHIA'S Lover; whilst his (...)
Is warbling forth this Love-inspired Song^
Love agitates with flames his noble breast,
And spreads there a most delicious feast:
The C^ystal Water turns to blushing Wine:
There banquets PSYCHE, and her Love divine:
Their meat is M^nn^, their Wine Nectar is,
Their Banquets Love, and everlasting Bliss,
Hell never 'frighted him so fast to Heaven,
Nor ever had Heaven such attractions given,
As Love gives now; he every day a year
Supposes till he does inhabit where
His blessed SOPHIA is: Nothing can move
Him backward now, be'ing drawn by force of Love.
Forwards he runs, and to his Love he pray'th,
That she would make a trial of his ^a^th:
All difficulties past account he does
As nothing, and as things mere frivolous,
Not to be counted hard, so high's his Zeal,
His Faith he longs with his Heart-blood to seal.
And now he thinks he A^^as could remove,
And nothing 'counts impossible with LOVE.
Satan indeed this noble Champion
In these Love-furies dares not set upon,
He stands a loof; The Pilgrim hasts a pace
To gain the end of this Heaven ^winning Race.
He be'ing Heaven's Favorite, and that he may
Be even lost, and swallowed in a Sea
Of divine Pleasures, and ^xcessive Bliss,
APOCALYPSIS she Commissioned is
To open his Senses with her Crystal Key,
That he aforehand may in Heaven be:
By Sophia.
her assistance she performed it straight,
And opened his inner senses five-fold gate.
No sooner had APOCALYPSIS bright
Fingers unlocked the Ga^es of 's inner sight,
But he the internal World beholds, and there
Myriads of Angels in their proper Sphere:
The Light World sees: whose chiefest rarities
Display themselves before his inner eyes.
Tempean pleasures co^rt his eyes; the Bliss
Of Edenean garden^ present is.
All Paradise, and whatsoever there
Grow'th, does before his inner sight appear.
The Angels in their glorious Robes of Light,
Compassed with splendant Rays appear in sight,
And things in Heaven unutterable, he
In highest pleasure, and content does see.
The thick gate of his inner ear un^a^^'d
No sooner was but he the voices heard
Of the Angelical Core, whose sweeter Lays
From dunghill Earth, to Heaven his Soul does raise.
The harmonious sound of Harps his ears does fill,
Proceeding from the blessed S^onian Hill,
Which does his soul with such sweet pleasure smite,
That she is overwhelmed with the delight.
Earth's duller Music, or that of the Spears,
^o this would be discordant in his ears:
If they men's souls cheer with their melody,
How more exceeding shall Heavens Harmony!
The inner AEthmoides being opened wide,
Whole clouds of Musk strait th'rough the passage slide,
Paradysaical Odors; the Perfumes,
Which from the Body of our Savior comes,
Press in: sweet Ambergris; perfuming Mirth,
Which fills the inner World does enter there.
Pinks, Violets, Roses are less odorate
Than these sweet Odors which assault the Gate.
The Gust unlocked; the dews of Sion Hill,
And Paradise upon his Tongue distill.
The Heavenly Manna, the Caelestial Cates
Of Bliss, more sweet than Honey fare he eats.
Nectar glides th'rough his Lips, where more sweets reign,
Than the Hymetian Honey-dews contain.
Haphe unlocked, the heavenly touch of Love.
Like gentle fire over his heart does move:
The Anoynted's Hand which does distempers heal,
Upon him laid, he sensibly does feel.
The Tincture which does from Christ's Body flow,
With great delight he feels on his to grow:
Thus he in his five senses ravished is:
He sees, hears, smells, tas^eth, and touches Bli^^e.
Ravished with the excess of his delight,
In Seas of pleasures he 's immerged quite,
His soul drinks in the sweets; too much upon
These Cates, feeds his Imagination.
But whilst he banquets at his fuller feast,
His Angel to him from the Heavens preit.
Taking Sophia's servant by the Hand
His mind by these he let him understand.
Blessed Pilgrim, and Sophia's servant, thou
Must not rest here, but farther still must go:
These are but streams, and Rivulets of Bliss,
Sophia she the only Fountain is.
Here thou may bath thy self, but can not swim
Until thou come to the Fountains brim:
There are vast Oceans, there thou may remain,
These are but easements for your griefs, and pain:
These are but objects at a distance, these
Are but refreshments, and to give you ease,
To make thy Way the sweeter, till thou art
Hid in the Closet of Sophia's Heart.
Take not thou then too much complacency
In these, which only but the Conducts be
To greater happiness; and do but show
The tithe of Bliss, which thou art going to.
Press on therefore; 'count every thing but ^elf
To the enjoyment of Sophia's self.
Roused by his Angel thus, the Pilgrim hies,
And toward the perfect mark he faster flies.
But far he had not gone before he meets
An adversary, who upon him sets,
VERTUMNUS 'twas, less constant than the Wind, Imagination or fancy.

In every shape seeks to disturb the mind.
A slye Ulysses, cunning to deceive,
Leading to error if you him believe.
His clothes were of all sorts of Feathers made;
With Windiness, and swiftness under-laid.
About his wast hung certain Looking-glasses
Which represented strange disguised faces,
Upon his left arm certain Pictures hung:
In which those things, which to the World belong
Were pictured, there Beauty was displayed
There Castles, Forts, Rivers, and Seas were made:
There Cities, Towns, Countries, Villages,
Wars, Battails, Peace, and such like things as these:
What ever Imagination's Pencil could
Express, in lively figures there were showed.
On his right arm Caelestial Pictures hung,
And whatsomever did to Heaven belong
There portrayed was: There Angels, Seraphims,
There Thrones, there Saints, and fie^y Cherubims^
There Paradise, there Light, Stars, Suns were seen,
And all Caelestial Forms, and Bodies drawn.
Accouter'd thus, he meets our Pilgrim, and
To stop his passage stretched out his left hand;
This sight was not like to his other foes,
No valor this, but shifts, and cunning knows:
He is no Champion but o'recomes by guile,
And ever his foe thinks on him gives the foil.
Like to the wicked Pontic Bithiae, that
Children, and Beasts with their looks facinate,
He does bewitch; skilled in Cyrcean arts,
From every Picture he his charms imparts:
And whilst they strangely draw our Pilgrim's eyes,
He in the mean time makes of him a prize.
Our Pilgrim meeting this fine fellow, thought
The Weaponlesse could have no mischief wrought.
He takes great pleasure to behold the charms
Which dangling hung at both his feathered arms;
Those Pictures yield content, his wandering mind
Treads in those Mazes, and no end can find:
Thus he delays his Journey, and this let,
His hasty Voyage makes him forget.
But his good Angel putting him in mind
Of's Journey, bid him this Deceiver bind;
For that he was a Foe, and sought to keep
Him back, by causing him awake, to sleep.
On him he set, but a hard task he found:
This Proteus would not be so quickly bound;
Stoutly they wrestle; but if on his arms
He cast his eyes, ^e's taken with those charms:
He varies shapes, and do he what he can,
No sooner bound but he is loosed again.
A Champion who has often won the field,
By Custom knows not how, at last to yield:
Each Conquest adds new Life, and courage to
His animated Soul; and makes him do
More than can be hoped for: Our Pilgrim so
Often Victor, now will not faint-hearted grow.
Here Faith assists him; and Perseverance
Upon his Foes arms does Ir'n chains advance.
At last they bind his left arm, when his right
He stretched out before the Pilgrim's sight:
Those heavenly Pictures now he dotes upon,
And brave Chimera's in his thoughts do run:
They Are all Caelestial, cries he, who can choose?
But on such heavenly Subjects always muse?
These are but shadows, says his Angel, thou
Unto the very substance must press to:
And therefore first of all thou must overcome
(...) IMAGINATION:
The Pilgrim seeing that he stopped his Way,
And longing still SOPHIA to enjoy,
After much struggling, flung him on the ground,
And with Perseverances chains him bound.
This Adversary being cast, he bent
His course to Paradise, and forward went.
Not far from thence his has^y steps did move
Under the shadow of a silent Grove:
The place was sacred to a Deity,
Who with still silence would adored be.
No babbling Echo in that Grove did dwell:
No whistling Blackbi^d, no sweet Nightingal,
No Bird at all came near those sacred boughs;
The grass, nor bleating Sheep, nor mowing Cows
Did feed; no living Creature did that blessed
Place enter, to disturb its quiet rest.
No ^^bble, chiding-Brook ran murmering there,
No Wind to move those silent Leaves did dare:
About the middle of this silent place,
P^tch'd on a mossie Hill a Couch there was;
To this the Pilgrim went, and gently hurled
Himself on it; As if another World
He entered had, he found himself; a rest
Seized on his working mind; both bad, and best^
Thoughts banished were; disturbing fancy, or
Imagination did not there discur.
Asleep he was not, nor yet did he dream:
Alive he was, but yet he dead did seem.
His mind worked not on this, nor that: but he
Raped was into a heavenly Lethargy.
This is the Silent passive state in which
God with his Finger Souls does often touch:
This is the sleep of Jacob, this the Trance
Of Paul, when he did to the Heavens advance:
This is the state, in which the Soul's blessed tie
Sees God (beyond Thoughts) Intellectually.
This is the st^te in which SOPHIA will
Souls (emptied thus) with her blessed Spirit fill.
Then is the Soul made fit for to receive
Those Bounties, which Heavens blessed Hand does give.
For whilst thoughts do her empty vessels fill,
Receive she cannot Heavens higher Bounties well.
A Cup filled to the brim can hold no more:
Nor stomach^ meat desire, if full before.
Then is the Soul fit to be wrought upon,
And to receive Heavens seal's impression.
What in this state she does or hear, or see,
Must needs be true; she cannot deceived be.
Unutterable were those Sweets, which here
Our Pilgrim felt; before his eyes appear
The Beauties of the inner Worlds, and on
His Soul divine irradiation
Is poured: and now his soul with Constant eye
Beholds true glances of AEternity.
Pens are too weak for to express the Bliss
Which in this silent state enjoyed is.
Thunders, and Whir^winds are not Heavens choice;
He softly whispers in a silent Voice.
The Souls ears then are eyes; what Heaven then shows
The Soul both hears, sees, ^eels, and truly knows.
Deep is the sight when that no thoughts control,
For Heaven then gives eyes to the passive Soul,
Past reach of Reason then she flies, and there
With a new Light sees demonstration clear.
But on our Pilgrim passes, and (to ease
Himself) often rests in such blessed Groves as these,
Which thick stood in the Way, there quiet rest
From working thoughts his passive Soul possessed.
And now unto this World he bids adieu,
The inner World appears in his view.
No new relations he receives, who from
Spiritual ties, and Heavens kind hand does come.
Those who do travel in the Way with him,
By Heavens Venture are his Brethren.
And Sisters, tied by a nearer Bond
Than ever Earth, or Nature yet had don'd.
They are his Brothers, be they rich or poor,
Who in their Hearts his (i. e. Gods.)
Father's Image bear.
Those are his Fathers, and his Mothers that
Into Regeneration begot
His Soul: Nature's Children do never to their
Parents, the Love which Heavens to theirs do bear.
Though he Loves all, yet there is degrees in Love,
Some are more near, and some do farther move:
As in the building of an House you see,
Some stones do touch, while others farther be:
Some are more near, some keep a distance, yet
All to the Structure are exceeding fit.
So Spirits joined are, in that divine
And heavn'ly building they do thus Combine.
Some they are nearer knit than others, thus
John unto Christ the most beloved was.
Here Spirits signatur'd alike conjoyn,
And in a mystic union combine:
Here Spirits be espoused, and here they see
That they meet helps unto each other be,
Some cannot receive from every vessel though
Their thirsty souls drink what from others flow.
One gives, another he receives, and he
Gives to another, here is the harmony.
Saints thus combined, are like a Tower, that
Unshaken stands against the Devils shot:
He fears such unions, therefore all his Art,
And cunning, he still uses, them to thwart.
O blessed union! whom God thus does join,
Let no man venture for to discombine.
This does produce a Love implete with Bliss,
Which far above natural affection is.
No Man but he that has 't the Virtue knows
Of this Love which from pure union flows.
Words cannot expressed, that heart which feels it does
Know certainly that here I speak a Truth.
The highest love of Friendship, which does shine
So bright 's the Image of this Love divine:
The Stars alone that does concatinate,
Nature, and Grace bind fast this firmer state.
He who this Love Possesses would rejoice
(And with great joy 'count it an happy choice)
To dye, and suffer torments for his Brother,
And loose his blood with joy to free another.
In this state two are one: one cannot smart
Feel, but it thrilleth th'rough the other's heart.
One cannot be sad, but by a Sympathy
The other's sinking Soul does almost dye.
Joy never bloometh in the Face of one,
But gladness in the other's eyes does shine.
Although ^eas, and a thousand Leagues do part
Their Bodies, yet by sympathetic Art
Their Spirits meet, Col. 2. 5.
and kiss, and do declare
At the same moment, how each other fare,
In the black lines, writ by each others hand^
A flowing Fire of constant Love thy find;
No sooner can their eyes be placed on them,
But th'rough them to their hearts, a flaming stream
Of sweetest Fire runs: and every Line
Unto that Fire, does new fuel join.
O blessed Love which from true Union flows!
Thy sweetness none, but those that taste thee knows!
Base Earthly Lust, and wanton Love's alloy
Is all but d^o^^e: and counterfeited joy.
Is mixed with them, hut here true sweetness is
True Joy, and an unutterable Bliss.
Our Pilgrim tasted this felicity,
Whereby he found all earthly Harmony
Below this sweetness* Sweets Affection
But far more sweet is heavenly Union.
In Bodies joining is Earth's Lovers bl^sse:
In Souls uniting Heavens true Lovers is.
Most justly did the Holy Spirit Call
The Serpent the most subtle Beast of all:
And though in subtilty he does excel,
His envy runs with it parallel:
This sets abroach that; this desires the ill;
That Is the Instrument for to perform it still:
And where he cannot do what he would to Man,
He 'l show his Teeth, and do what ever he can.
Think you our Pilgrim, though so far he be
Gone, past the reach of his fell Subtilty?
No Hell must show his envy still, and to
The very last try what his power can do.
When he had tried all Stratagems in vain,
The Pilgrim's union with the Saints to strain,
To burst that League, which breaks the Leagues of Hell,
And their united Forces often repel:
To spoil that marriage of Spirits, from
Whose happy juncture sacred Powers do come,
Which overthrow those Legions of the
Great Prince of Hell, and all Impiety:
To break that true-Loves Knot, which only can
Bind fast the hands of this fierce foe to Man.
When he in vain to hinder this had tried,
And saw our Pilgrim by an happy Guide
Had it attained; he seeks some other Way
In midst of all his Sweets him to betray.
His envious eye beholds the Pilgrim's Soul
Often to carouse it in Loves sacred Boul,
Where she whole streams of Nectar gulped down,
Sweeter than Honey, or the Honeycomb.
Down to his Stygian Kingdom goes the Foe,
And there assembles all his Cooks below;
Makes them to cull the fairest Fruit the Tree
Of ills does bear: First then Complacency,
Then Covetousness, then Pride, then S^lfishnesse,
Envy, and Jealousy, and such as these
He takes: and by a cunning Chemistry
Draws out their blackness, and deformity;
Extracts their bitterness, and makes them fair,
Refined like Crystal, and as pure as air;
But yet the poison still was left behind,
Which stronger grew the more they were refined;
From these a juice he drew, most fair, and clear,
And up he mounteth to the Pilgrim's Sphere.
Sculking behind a cloud this Serpent lay,
And for an opportunity did stay
To poison him: and VIGILANTIA did
No sooner turn her back, and step aside,
But to the Boul he stepped (for she alas!
The noble Pilgrim's chief Pincerna was)
And in he poured that Hellish juice; among
Heavens blessed Nectar mixing that poison strong.
The unawary Pilgrim by and by the Cup
Takes, and in 's Nectar drinks Hell's poison up.
Anon the several poisons 'gin to work;
Whilst Satan laughing in his sleeve, does lurk
Unseen, to see the sport: Oh! how he smiled
At the conceit of Man's being thus beguiled.
The Pilgrim did not feel that he was ill.
Or that Hel's poison did his Nectar spill:
But now it 'gan to work, he did not cast
His eyes unto the Fountain but embraced
Too much the streams: Too much Complacency
He took, in the fruition of those high
Gifts of the Spirit; too much dotes upon
Visions, Voices, Spirits union,
He fears to lose them, and cannot resign
To Heaven his Nectar, or his gifts divine.
Now to himself all Spirits he would engrosse,
He Covets gifts, and 'counts no greater cross
Than for to lose them; thus does Co^etousnesse
Spring in his Soul in its refined dress.
Pride started up, and though spiritualized,
A curious clothing for his Soul devised,
Wherein he prides himself; he 's not content
Except that others know he 's eminent
In all the Gifts and graces of the Spirit;
He loves to be sought after for his merit:
Clothed with Heavens Pride of gifts, and graces, he
Aspires, and would accounted something be.
Next Selfishnesse did operate, and that
Self-Int'rest, and Propriety begat
In Spirits, Gifts, and Graces: This does seem
For to belong to him, and none but him.
Then Envy worked, and he is not content
To see another be more eminent
In Visions, Raptures, or the like; or that
Others enjoy them, and he go without.
Then Jealousy spread through every vein,
Its virulent poison fuming in his Brain;
He every one suspects, and jealous is
Left others rob him of what he Calls his.
He fears to lose a Spirit; that another
His gifts or Graces shining Light should smother:
He jealous is lost his Lights be out-shon,
Or that another's should eclipse his own.
This Hell's refining poison spreading through
His Breast, ever he aware was brought him to:
And thus the noble Stone was almost spoiled,
When for it the Pilgrim had long stoutly tovl'd,
That eye whose Rays pierce the Earth's Center, and
Sees to the bottom of the Stygian strand:
Which spite of Night; and Hell's calliginous
Mantle, beholds what ever Satan does:
That Eye which every secret thought betrays,
And to its self, hid actions open lays,
That Eye behel'd the spite of Hell, and saw
Upon the Pilgrim's heart his poison gnaw.
Nothing so soon as the objects of the eye,
Pity attracts for others misery:
The ear so soon does not affect the Heart
With generous pity as the Optic part:
He that 's all Eye, and every thing does see,
Can he w'hout pity view man's misery?
No, he 's all pity, and his Bowels roll
At every pang of an afflicted Soul.
Poison in the Pilgrim's Breast no sooner flows,
But he his pity, and his mercy shows.
His Angel-guardian is Commissioned strait
To show to him, the Stygian Prince 's hate:
And against that poison which so strongly wrough^
In 's breast, to offer him an Antidote.
Glad of the message, down the Angel flies,
Whilst sparkling Joy beamed from his sacred eyes;
Glad to do service to Heavens Servitour,
He shows himself clad with refulgent air.
In 's hand he brought a Crystal Glass which ^^ll'd
Was with pure Light, from Heavens Alimbeck stilled:
This he unto the Pilgrim gave, and bid
Him drink it up; The which he strait ways did.
No sooner had he gulp'd it down, but he
Beheld his Error, and Hell's treachery:
He saw the infestous poison, though 'twas clear,
By this draught now his eyes far purer are,
And can behold all its impurities,
Which had caused all irregularities.
This draught the Vail pulled off, and he espies,
Where Hell's strong poison in Heavens Nectar lies,
So had he seen a noxious Serpent dwell
In The green grass, and Toads in a Crystal Well.
Startled at this sight: seal my eyes again
He cries, or else from me this poison drain.
It Is better I were blind, and could not see,
Then to behold an helpless misery.
It is a double pain hard haps to bear,
And seeing them remediless to fear:
An unseen harm less d^ead does cause? I pray
Or take my eyes or this foul Ill away.
It is thy self, the Angel does reply,
That to thy self must give the remedy:
There is a pill will do it: I Will show it thee,
If thou will take it freely follow me.
The willing Pilgrim soon consents, they go
Strait forward without turning in Heavens Way.
Now far they had not gone, ever they came to
A pleasant Green, whose lust^ous verdant hew
Cheered the Pilgrim's Sp'rite; and in the midst
Thereof, he saw, a flaming Altar placed:
And coming nearer fairly wrote upon
The sides he saw TRUE RESIGNATION:
'Twas to this Altar that blessed Abraham
(The Angel said) to offer Isaac came,
And here it is, and in th^se flames divine,
And on this Altar thou must offer thine:
Here what somever thou do dearly prize,
To Heaven must prove a pleasing sacrifice.
It Is true, thou did pleasures, and sins once bring
Unto the Fire: A fairer offering
Now must the Oblation be: As Earth by you
Was offered up; so offer Heaven too.
Not only Earth's, but Heavens fair gifts divine,
Thou on this Altar, must to God resign.
Amongst those Flames (which were Aetherial)
The Angel put his hand, and culled a coal;
A Carbuncle set in a Ring of Gold
Glowed as the Coal between his fingers hold.
Lo here a Pill (says he) that does contain
An Antidote, against that deadly Bain
Thou have drunk down: in this one Pill there are
The Lemnian Earth, and precious Bezoar,
Treacle, and Metridate locked up: This pure
Pill will effect not an Ac^sian Cure:
Not all the drugs of A^sculapius
Or Galen can do half so much as this.
The joyful Pilgrim takes the flaming Pill;
Which from his mouth down to his heart did thrill;
No sooner was it ^in his Breast, but straight
He Hel's soul Poison did Evacuate.
That glowing Pill fired from his heart's fast hold,
And utterly destroyed Hel's bainful Cold.
Thus by the Heavenly Therap^utick, he
Receives by Heat for cold a Remedy.
Now bas^el'd Satan, with an hideous roar
To Hell flies vexed, more than he joy'd before.
Shall Servants grumble to repay their Lord
His own? or not be willing to afford
Him back, what he lends them? Shall Stewards grieve,
When their Lords at their hands their own receive?
Why then does man so often shrug, and pine,
When God bids him his lendings to resign?
A careful Father that has sent unto
His Son some sums honestly to employ.
Is it not requisite he should be still
Exactly subject to his Fathers Will?
And that the money back be paid again
With willingness if he require the same?
Or should not that Depositum still be
At his dispose without an injury?
Now if the Father should behold his Son
Squander his Coin, in evil courses run:
Lose his Estate in Games! or be unfit
To manage (for which end he gave him) it;
Does he do wrong unto his Child, if then
He summons back his ill-us'd Love again?
Then grumble not O Man! if Heaven shall
What he has lent (if thou abuse't) recall.
Thou nothing have; why make thou then such moan
When God does call for nothing but his own?
Is it not better that thou willingly
Thy self, and thine to Heavens high Will should tie?
When that thou know none contradict it can?
Yet such the frowardness of wilful Man
Is, that although he knows God's Will be done
Must, yet will he contrary to it run:
Such is his stubbornness; and thus he 'l shew't,
To contradict God had he power to do it.
God will his Will effect: This pleases Heaven
Though, that Man's will should with his Will be even:
That our wills should will nothing, but what he
Would have: That his Command ours subject be.
His will is the Day Star, the fairest Guide,
Who follows it can never turn aside.
That sanctified Pill of glowing fire
Which did unto our Pilgrim's breast retire,
P^rg'd forth Hell's venom, and what ever might
Unto Heavens sacred Will prove opposite.
He now is willing, what ever he does prize,
To God in those bright flames to sacrifice.
His clothes pu^ off; and naked, (only clad
With true subjection to the will of God,
His Priestly Ephod) he gives to the flame
What ever Heaven had freely given him.
Those lustrous flames he with Ambrosia fed,
And all his Manna on the Altar spread:
His Oil, and Honey in the fire fryes,
And his choice Nectar proves a Sacrifice.
Ah there he parts with all Heavn'ns gifts divine,
And them again does unto Heaven resign.
Visions, and Raptures in the flames he flings,
His unions, and all those bubbling springs
Of choysest Wine, his holy Gifts, his Powers,
And Rapting Heats upon the flames he showers.
His dainty Hymas, and Soul-bewrapting lays,
And Heaven and all, he to those flames betrays.
He does himself of all his pride disrobe,
Leaving himself as poor as naked Job;
His Heart, and will at last he there bequeaths
And all his Riches to those flames he gives;
And now having nothing left, with a profound
Submission, his Lips do kifle the ground,
While the sweet Fumes of this blessed Libament
Are from the Altar to Heavens nosethrils sent.
Abel's sweet offerings never more pleasing were
To God, than these our Pilgrim offered here.
Nor did to Heaven a sweeter savor spring
From the burnt flesh of Noa^'s offering.
Nor Abraham's Ram was more accepted; nor
Smelt sweeter Aron's Frankincense, and Myr^h.
The spotless Lamb the offering for Peace
Was not a gentler offering than these:
North' Oil, and Meal the offering of meat:
Nor Salom^n's whole He catombs more great.
Nor did all Aaron's offerings but show
What Christ for us did; and what we must do.
Heaven did not Aaron's offerings prefer
To what our Pilgrim freely offered here:
Nor was he more a Priest than he, who had
All sacrificed to the Living God.
Christ was a Prophet, Priest, and King: so we
By him made Prophets, Priests, and Kings shall be.
Our Pilgrim having offered all: upon
The sounding Altar of his warbling Tongue,
At last he offers Heaven this precious Song,
Whose Airs like Mir^h, and Incense smelled strong:
His Heart flew with his words: with open Ears
Heaven, from such Tones the speaking Music hears.
Whole Hecatombs of sins have I
upon thine Altar laid
Sin, Flesh, the world by me did dye,
By me their Death they had.
I sacrificed them all to thee
O King of Kings! O God!
Their savor to thy Throne did fly,
And to thy blessed abode.
I am a Priest become, for thou
Have made me one, and I
My Mitre to thy Throne do b^w,
And to thy Majesty.
Here in true Resignation
I offer unto thee:
My Ephod's true subjection,
My Girdle Purity.
Upon that Altar I have laid
All that I have, and now
I have my self quite naked made,
Unto thy Throne I bow.
Those rich Attires which thine own hand
Had decked me withal,
I have pulled off at thy Command,
And burnt them at thy Call.
More dear than my best Blood they were,
Yet without grudg I give
Them all into this blessed Fire,
That I might naked live.
My self I truly now resign,
My will is not mine own;
My Heart, my works, my words are thine,
Self now is fled, and gone.
Accept my Sacrifice O Lord!
But I can nothing Crave,
My will is thine, my word, thy Word,
I truly nothing have.
I passive am, my will is stain
Under thine Altar, I
In true subjection do remain,
And dying daily dye
Deny me Heaven, if it please thee
I cannot now repine;
For I subject now unto thee,
My will is thoroughly thine.
Confine me to the deepest Hell,
Enchain me there for aye,
If it please thee I Will think it well,
And willingly will stay.
Whilst on the Earth I dwell if thou
All miseries do give,
I gently under them will ^ow;
Contentedly will live.
And if thou strik'st me blind or lame,
Or deaf, or dumb, yet still,
So long as from thy hand it came
I entertain it will.
Let all the World with scoffs deride
Me, blast my better Name:
Or set me up with praises pride,
I still will be the same.
Command me what thou will, I am
how ready to obey,
Nor Reputation, or shame,
When thou bidst go shall stay.
And if thou bid^st I Will cut my hair,
I will the madman play,
My hinder parts I will make bare; Ezekiel.^.

What ever thou bid'st obey.
I th'rough the World will naked go.
And th'rough the Flames I Will run;
If thou command'st it shall be so,
Thy Will it shall be done.
If thou command'st me to the Rack,
I there will passive be,
And when my very heart strings crack,
With Joy I Will yield to thee.
If thou Command me to speak,
I boldly then will do 't,
Nor fear of Death shall silent make*
Nor cause me to be mute.
In harder things than these, I Can
Subject unto thy will,
For now my own is th'roughly slain,
I ready, thine fulfill.
For now I can remain Content
Without that glorious Blisle,
Which once thy goodness to me sent,
Since that thy will it is.
Those Visions, Raptures, Prophesies,
Those Gifts, and Graces all
Those Hymns, those Ardors, Harmon^es
Can render at thy Call.
All Unions with Spirits, I
Without can gladly go:
Can be content Continually
Not that sweet Bliss to Know.
I without Envy now can see
Thy Gifts, and Graces given
To others: and content to be
In Hell, whilst they are in Heaven.
I am not Jealous, nor do doubt
That others will rob me:
I am Content to be without,
Whilst others filled be.
I am Content that others live
In all thy Gifts divine:
Whilst I my self am in the Grave,
And to thy Will resign.
Do what thou please Lord with me,
For I am truly slain:
I being subject unto thee,
At thy dispose remain.
This is the state which Reason's foolish Schools
Do nominate the Paradise of Fools,
Because their high adored Deity
Reason,'s cast down, and on the Earth must lie.
When the holy Ark enters the Temple, then
Dagon must fall, and break his Neck; so when
Wisdom divine its Beauties does display
Upon our Souls, Reason much pack away:
That is too shallow, for to Comprehend
Those things which WISDOM'S Wisdom does Command;
It Is a false Judge, and cannot truly see
Beyond the dark Clouds of Mo^tality.
The first degree in wisdom's sacred School, Paul's Ep^stle to (...) Corinth. 1
co^. (...) 18.

Is to be Wise, by first becoming Fool:
Fool to the Earthly Reason, in Divine
Wisdom, a Wise man by subjection shine.
Mistake me not; I Will not have you put out
The Souls bright Eye, and so become a Bruit*
I Would not have Reason banished from Men;
Mere Animals indeed they would be then;
But that our Reason pass not those Bounds given
To terminate it, by the Hand of Heaven.
But that our Reason should its weakness own.
Confess that Heavens Arcana's are unknown
To her; That her weak eyes cannot gaze upon
The glorious splendour of bright wisdom's Sun;
And not to dare with a proud scrutiny
To search Heavens secrets with her pur-blind eye.
Our eyes are Lights unto our steps: but shoot
Their Balls against the Sun, he 'l put them out:
Reason's our Guide below; but when she flees
Against wisdom's Sun she loses both her eyes.
Reason's illuminate, and soar's on high
When wisdom lends unto her an eye:
Then, her eye passes to the highest Sphere,
Searches the deeps, and sees Wonders there:
But before Reason can this eye attain,
She must acknowledge that her own are vain.
This Lesson now Heavens Pilgrim learned, and He
Subjects his Reason to Divinity.
He knows he must be born a new, and then
He knows he must become a Child again.
With such Heavens Kingdom is implete: you know
Children are Innocent, and harmless too.
They Are pretty Lambs, poor Tenderlings, their eyes
The seats of Innocence, of Smiles the prize.
They have no wills; you may do what you list
To them: they are not able to resist.
But if you h^rt them the defense you have,
Their Tong^^s are, which with cries for pity crave.
Set them down here they cannot stir, or go
Till you remove them; they no evil know.
The Devil cannot hurt them: they defy
With pretty Innocence, his subtilty.
They know no guile, they know no evil, nor
Sin. They made fit for Heavens Mansions are.
The (...) ^o such who gain the Child-like state, M^^. ^8 6.

(...) has already read their woeful fate:
Th^se who offend such Babes had better be,
(...) with a Millstone, cast into the Sea.
They are his Care, his tender Lambs, who these
Offend, do highly Christ himself displease.
O^r tru^-resign'd, and child like Pilgrim now,
His, to (...)'s highest will does bow:
But whilst he at his Altar prostrate lies,
His Angel speaking thus, Commands him rise.
Arise thrice happy Pilgrim! Let us still
Proceed, for that (I Am sure) is Heavens Will:
Thou almost fitted art, for to behold
Those glories, which by Tongues cannot be told.
Th^^ce bowed the Pilgrim, not to him, but God:
And on they went in Heavens illustrious Road.
But by, and by, two flying Coursers brought
Thither, at the Angels beck a Chariot:
Into (...) they went; no sooner seated they
Were, but the row the Air the Coursers Wings make way:
Earth 's left behind, and now they launched are
Into the calm Sea of the gentle Air.
The Angels Pilot, guide, and Charoteer,
Who upward drives, and from the Earth does steer.
A place there is not viewed by mortal eyes,
Which 'twixt four Worlds just in the middle lies:
Thither the Angel took his Course, and on
A rising Hill, to Land his Chariot came.
Alighting there, they mount unto the top,
Where was an antique Cross erected up.
After the Pilgrim round had viewed the place,
And with his eyes su'd to know where he was,
The Ang^l then his long-kept silence brake,
And this unto the holy Pilgrim spoke.
This Hill on which thou stand'st does lie between
The four great Worlds; from hence all may be seen:
Cast down thine ^ye, that which thou se^st below,
Is the outward World, from which we came but now:
Where yo^' dark mist is, upon thy lest Hand,
The Devils dark internal World does stand:
Where yon bright Light on thy right hand does shine,
Is the Light World, or Paradise divine:
Over thy head from whence that glory springs,
The Mansion is of the great King of Kings.
The Aeternal World: and thither it is, I know
Thou pressest, and desi^ous art to go.
Th'rough Paradise the way does thither lie,
Which ever thou cann'st attain thou here must dye.
Here thou must crucified be, for that
Through Hell thou must pass ever thou can come at
Blessed Paradise: and dangerous it is
To pass th'rough Hell before you Death do kiss.
Death will disrobe thee of whatever may
In Hell's dark Kingdom thy brave progress stay.
Thou must to all things crucified be,
And no impediment retain with thee.
For if thou bear any thing, on which
Wrath's mighty King his iron claws may pitch,
He will torment thee, and enforced by pain
Thou to this Cross return must back again.
Thou can not pass his Kingdom, until thou
Thy Head to blessed Death, do freely bow:
For by this Death thou gain'st thy Savior's blood,
Which through Hell thy passage will make good:
Wrath's King may threaten then, but dare not d^
For 's ears, the least of injuries to you.
But if thou ventur'st the row his Kingdom, and
No^ Crucified here, thou can not stand.
Thou se'st the Way, now if thou can embrace
A happy (...), here is the Cross, and place.
Ch^^st made Death easy; fear not then to dye,
But let this Mount, be thy Mount CALVARY.
This said the Angel bid the place adieu,
And the row the smooth air in the Chariot flew,
Leaving the Pilgrim to encounter Death,
And to gain Life, by yield^ng mortal breath.
The Pilgrim being left alone, unto
The Cross^ he ran, and his sweet lips did glue
Unto its hard sides; from his mouth there came
Blessings, and hearty k^^^es mixed with them.
About its sides his grasping arms did twine,
Enclosing it as Elmes the t^nder Vine.
Blessed instrument by Death of Life, cried he,
Man's gain, Hel's pain loss to Mortality,
The zeal of Heaven; the blessed s^oyl of sin,
The Key that shuts Hell out, and lets Heaven in:
The Way to glory; and of Crowns the gain;
The Bar to Death, and everlasting pain:
To Death, but it is of Flesh, and Sin the Way:
The Road to Life, and everlasting Joy.
Come Death; come Death, I now prepared am
To Dye, Come nail me to this Cross: O come,
Come strike me with thy killing Dart! for I
To give the Ghost up of mortality,
Of Flesh, of Sin do long: Come here is my Heart
Prepared to receive thy killing Dart.
Thou shall slay me, but when I yield my breath
I Victor am: for my last foe is Death. (...). 15. 26.

DEATH then appeared: though terrible he seem
To others does, he pleasing showed to him.
'Twas not the common Deafh, that takes away
The little breath, we in this world enjoy.
T was not that heap of Bones that frightful Death,
Which digs men's graves, and robs them of their breath:
That slays whole thousands every Day, and feasts
His fleshlesse Carcass both on Men, and Beasts.
No 'twas another Death, which yet would seem
To some more terrible, and sierce than him.
This Death's both foe, and Friend, a foe to all
The sinful Man; Friend to the Spiritual.
This kills the sinful Man, but durifies
The outward; slays that, this rectifies.
The sinful Man trembled to see the ^ace
Of Death, and his vile execution place.
O how he strugled, but it was in vain,
The Pilgrim scorned him longer to retain:
His willing arms he gave to Death, who straight
Both Feet, and Hands with Nails did perforate,
And fixed them to the Cross: and there, upon
That Tree to true mortification
He did attain; the Flesh, the World, and Sin
Was slain: all which so long alive had been.
This dying Swan, now drawing near his end,
In such sweet notes his latest breath did spend.
Vain world adieu
No more on you
I Will cast my dying eyes:
This sacred cross
Than all your dross
To me 's a greater prize.
Vain Flesh be gone,
No longer on
Your Beauties will I dote:
The World, and you
I bid adieu
To sail in Death's safe boat.
Too long I 'ave been
Alive to Sin
But now upon the Cross,
That life I Will leave,
And Death receive
Yet gain Life, by Life's loss.
I have o'rethrone
Temptation,
And often given the soil
But now I Will quell
The Root of Hell,
And 's nest in my breast spoil.
By me has sia
Resisted been
But now its root I will,
Though, by the strise,
I lose my life
For growing ever spill.
My Feet are nayld,
(Affections quail'd)
Unto this Cross: my Hands
(My active Life)
Now cease strife)
Are bound with iron bands.
Refined things
May take their wings:
And speed to others now,
I passive am
And dead become,
To live I know not how.
My Face grows pale,
My Spirits fail,
My dying breath does fly,
Have Death, I pray,
Take life away,
For I do long to dye.
Death at these words struck th'rough his tender heart,
And Life, and death at one stroke did impart:
Rivers of sinful blood ran down from his side;
The sinful Nature groaned th^ice and died:
Flesh left the stroke, and was enforced to yield, Heb. 12. 4. Paul to the
Romans, Romans 6. 9. Rev. 20. 6.

And to triumphing Death bequeath the Field:
Thus he to Blood resisted: and did share
In this first Death; nor does he others fear
Now he has tasted this; By this who fall,
Fear not the Eternal, nor the Natural.
A pleasing Victim on the Cross he lay;
Heavens Sacrifice, and Death's most blessed prey.
Go Hell and tempt him now with sugard Pills,
Thrice gild, thrice dulcifie your bitter ills,
Use all your Art, use all your Eloquence,
Conjoyn your Words, and your false Excellence,
Go all conspire in one him to deceive,
See if he 'l either hear you, or believe
Your subtle prating: Strength, and policy
Together knit with all your subtilty,
And see if either will admission gain:
Away all your endeavors are in vain,
Do not not you see he is dead? think you that he
Then with your subtilties will moved be?
Go spread a Table, and set on the Board
The choysest vyands fruitful Earths afford;
A thousand Cups with all her pleasures fill,
Tempt him, and see if eat or drink he will.
Away vain Idiots, you have lost your prize:
Hell, and the World's cousen'd when Man thus dies.
O blessed Death that seals our eyes, our ea^,
Our mouth that they nor taste, nor see, nor hear
Can, what Hell gives, or shows, or speaks to us:
Thrice happy Man whom this blessed Death frees thus.
A dead Man's wholly passive, what you list
You may do to him, he cannot resist:
So here our Pilgrim dead upon the Cross,
At the disposal of his Father was,
And truly mortified he hangs on
The Cross, until the ^ngel takes him down.
The Heavenly Nuncio with Peace's Olive bough,
And with victorious Palms, and Laurels, flew
From the Aetherial Court; a wreath he brought
Which cannot be by Earth's Gold and Silver bought:
It was a Branch of purest Gold, which he
Commissionated, pulled from Life's fair Tree,
To make a Garland for the Pilgrim's Head,
And happily to crown with Life, the Dead.
One Hand bore this; as precious a thing
And 's Sacred he in 's other Hand did bring;
A garment 'twas of Scarlet died in grain,
Whose Tyrian blushes, Virgins blushes stain;
The Pinks, and Roses as he passed by,
Hung down their heads; to see a better dye
Blushed for shame; but growing pale with spite,
They (being outvy'd) themselves disrobed quite.
This Garment tincted was in that blessed Blood,
That Crimson spring, that deep died Scarlet flood,
Which flowed from Iesu's sacred side, when he
Died, that the sinful World might saved be.
The Ermin-lined Purple which does lie
Solely upon the back of Majesty,
Though covered over with Avacan Gemms,
To this rich Robe a simple Garment seems.
Man, though he 's clothed, is naked without this;
With this clothed, though he 's naked, clothed is.
Unto the Crosse's foot the Angel came,
And with his lovely eyes considers him;
He sees the Pilgrim dead: the sinful man,
Flesh, and its Members crucified, and slain:
No gashly sight this was; Death not enhance
Did, those fresh glories of his countenance:
This Death although h' had made him freely bleed,
Wrapped not his Body in his sheets of Lead:
His eyes were sweetly closed, his cheeks did look
Like those of the departing Feavour-struck:
A dying Fire seemed there to lie,
Which able was to court the nicest eye.
From thence the helpful Angel takes him down,
And with the Golden wreath of Life does Crown
His pious Temples: on his Head he pours
Out of transparent Viols crystal showers,
Pure water taken from the Fount of Bliss,
Which every Limb from head to foot does kiss,
Which cleanses every Limb, and part: And so
The Stone's deep black converted is to snow.
Stripped naked of his former rags, upon
His back he puts the bloody Garment on:
A Noble color, White is turned to red,
The Work's now almost thoroughly finished.
Thus clothed, and dressed, to Life the Pilgrim came
Another Man, and yet the very same.
He looked as if he were new born again;
His eyes saw now what he had never seen.
His wandering Orbs on every thing do pass,
As if enquiring in what place he was
He saw a Region, which his eyes never did
Before behold; The Region was hid
Before, but now lay open to his view.
His speaking eyes the willing Angel drew
For to declare what place it was: He brake
Silence, and thus unto the Pilgrim spoke.
Locus Purgatorius inter Mundos.
OAvarice! for Gold, and Silver's prize,
The golden Truth, thou 'ast turned to drossy Lies!
Best things corrupted prove the worst of all:
By Rome's false Limbo, does true LIMBO fall. Optima corruption est pessima.

The Christian Churches first blessed Founders sure,
Their Streams delated from the Fountain pure:
Heaven put that breath into their mouths, which they
Inspired thus, to others did conveigh.
The holy Ghost upon them breathed, nor was
Their Words corrupted by an humane gloss.
Then flourished Truth, and all our Hyerarchie
Rejoy^'d so pure a Church on Earth to see.
No pitchy clouds of error then did press
'Twixt their eyes, and the Sun of Righteousness;
The Truth shon then as clear, as does the Sun
Mounted in 's golden Chariot, at noon.
(Christ's Church sees clearly still where ever it be
Scattered, through others; and the Head is he)
But envious Satan, when he saw Truth so
Extremely spread, and over the World to grow;
He sewed his Tares of Errors, and did blind
With clouds of darkness, Man's true eye, the Mind.
These faster than the true Wheat grew; this crop
Of evil weeds, did soon the Wheat o're-top.
Darkness grew on apace; anon the Day
Could not its Light but here and there display,
Th'rough the small cranies of dark clouds: then 'twas
Pride, and Ambition in Rome's Church took place:
Then crept in all those Ceremonies; then
The Truth gave place unto the wiles of Men.
Then Avarice, with her hooked Talons made
Such Laws, which turned Religion to a Trade,
And for the Love of Money did disguise
Fair Truth, and clothed her with a pack of Lies.
Something of precious Truth; something of Day,
Under disguise; under the clouds there lay.
Your Silver ISIS about Chelsy's not,
The same, as where his bubling springs do put
First forth their Crystal Heads near Thorlton, for
Churne's, wondrushe's, and Cherwell's waters there
And Tame's, Coln's, Brents, with his clear streams do run:
So on the other side he entertain
Does Ock, Lad, K^nn^t, Surrie's Rivers too,
Whose severe Waters with his mingle do:
Yet with these may at Ch^lsy run the same
Pure waters, which from his clear sp^ing-head came.
So pure Religion's streams, by this time had
With many of Hel's Stygian stream lets spread,
Which were polluted with their Waters, yet
Amongst them Truth's pure Crystal streams did ^^i^,
But so bemudded that they scarce were seen
But by those clear eyes who did dive for them.
The snowy flower is mixed with the Bran:
The chaff with Wheat; one sift the other fa^
We must: not ^^ing them both away, and make
The ^ne useless for us, for the other's sako.
We must beware when that the Tares we cull;
Lest we with them the wheat up also pull.
Fifteen Cent'ries, and two decades of years,
After Christ's death, from Isleben appears
A Light by which Rome's muddy streams were seen,
By which the Truth men strove to c^ll between
Error's black clouds; But Zeal them so possessed,
They her rejected, 'cause by Rome's hands dressed.
So fearful were they of a Romish dress,
That Truth they 'ad rather leave, than her possess
In that false Habit; many Truth's despised
Were thus, because by Rome they were disguised.
Among the rest, and not the least, this place,
This Region which thou now behold'st, one was:
And 'cause Rome's fopperies had obscured the Light
Of it, forsooth they it discarded quite:
And by the ears it from existence whorry,
For fear of entertaining Purgatory.
The Truth of it now testify thou may
To others, now thy self thou seen it have.
It is not such thou see as Rome does fain,
For the all-corrupting Gold, and Silver's gain.
This is the middle Region, and does hide
It self between four Worlds, on every side
They bound this place. Would thou know who those be
Who yonder up and down you wandering see?
They are departed Souls, who had begun
The holy Race to Sion's Hill to run:
Who had Hel's broad Rode left, and who in this
Heavens Path, some progress made had toward Bliss;
But ever their Natures purified were,
Ever they attained had to that happy Sphere,
Which unto Paradise immediate leads,
Pa^ca assunder cut their vital thread:
Their parted souls then to this Region flew,
Where they must perfect what they had to do,
Where they 'till purified must remain,
Ever they to Paradise admittance gain.
Th'rough Hel's deep Center must the Soul first pass,
And th'rough a Sea of Fire to that of Glass,
Th'rough the first Principle (as thou anon
Shall see) Now if the Soul's not clothed upon
With Christ's sanguinous Robe, the second and
Most holy Principle, she cannot stand,
But there is captivate, or beaten back
Unto the Cross, to endure the holy Rack,
By putting off the first, that so she may
With the second Principle her self array:
Then may the pass, and not before; Those who
In flesh this holy Robe do not indue,
But dying hold by Faith 's strong clue: are brought
Hither, to finish what remains unwrought.
The Way to Heaven is not so easy, as
By poor beguiled Man imagined was:
Straight is that Ga^e, and narrow is that Way, Mat. 7. 14.

Which Mortals does conduct to perfect Day:
He that to press the row this straight Gate would se^k,
Must fling the World, and flesh from off his neck,
They cannot enter Heaven with him; nor can
Some Notions prove a Savior unto Man:
The Work must somewhere finished be; if on
The Earth, to Heaven they go: if not 'till done
It fully be they here remain: But those
Wend straight to Hell, who Hel's highway had chose.
Man calls God merciful, yet makes the same
God, the third part of all mankind to damn.
Hard-hearted Man! do thou not know there is
An armed Cherub before the Gate of Bliss?
Do thou not know that Paradise is kept,
By Arms unwearied, Eyes that never slept?
By a bright flaming Fauchon, which enough
Of terror strikes to keep the wicked off?
Or tell me Man! have thou yet never heard
That Imperfection cannot pass this Guard?
Nor flesh, nor blood can enter Heaven, nor can
Ever come there the least imperfect man. ^ Cor. 15. 50.

No Imperfections enter Paradise.
If Man's not perfect then before he dies,
(A some by no means grant) where shall he then
Be perfect made, but in this Region?
It Is true, degrees ^ere in perfection are:
None thoroughly perfect still he comes, where
Mortality of immortality
Is swal owed up: where he beholds the Eye,
And Face of God without a Screen: to this
None can attain whilst in the flesh he is.
How few are there that to a perfect State
Arrive, before Death Life does terminate!
To such a State I mean, in which they may
To Paradise go, and make here no stay,
When their Souls fly their Bodies: Souls must clear
Be purged on Earth, from what they drunk in there.
It is not Notions that the Work must do,
It must be real, and done thoroughly too:
This Work not in the Head, but Heart does lie,
That Is most regarded by the all-seeing Eye:
If they with Christ are truly risen, they
When Dye, pass by this purging Region may.
But tell me Man! what shall those Pilgrim's do,
Who in Heavens Way have gone, but come not to
Be dead, and risen with our Lord, when by
The Way they lose their mortal Life, and dye?
They are not fit for Paradise: What then?
Must they be hurled to the Stygian Den?
Must they be damned? with God's great Mercy rather
Does it not stand, to bring their Spirits hither?
Where they may finish, what they had begun; And stay

And to the end of Sion's Race may run?
Do say it is by Christ's Blood they are purged? we know it:
But do thou know what time he 'l take to do it? Donec, longa dies, profecto
temporis Orb concretam exemit labem, purumque reliquit Aethereum sensum, atque
aurai simplicis ignem. Virg.

It Is he that does it here; it is by his Blood,
And in this place that they are purified.
It was dear Pilgrim Man's stupidity,
That me enforced to this Apostrophe.
But now* I Will tell thee more: This is the place
Which by Christ's Sermon once made happy was,
When he to those who perished in the flood
Repentance preached; and made 1 P^t. 46
predictions good.
'Twas to the dead departed souls that he,
Bestov'd his blessed! bounteous Charity
After his own death, when he had in one
By an Hypostatical Union, 1 P^t. 3^ 19, 19.

His humane Soul, and Deity conjoined,
And not in No^h's time, as Zach. 9. 11, 12. Esaias 61. 1. Mat. 12. 22. Nor in
this world, nor in the world to come, shall they have pardon.
some divined.
To Spirits, not to Men in flesh he spoke, Scaliger.

And did their Prison, then a Temple make.
I would a question ask of peevish man,
Who does to Death, those you call Heathen damn,
Se'ing God all-mighty did with those souls bear,
Who before the flood would not his servant hear.
But perished by the Waters, and did them
Not to an everlasting Death Condemn,
But to this Region brought their souls, where they
Their Ransom might with true Repentance pay:
Whither the Gentiles, (who but 'bate their name
Do in morality most Christians shame)
Who before Christ's time lived by Nature's Law,
And conscientious unto what they saw;
Who had indu'd a moral Honesty,
Studious of that, and all Sobriety,
Seeing that their Nature's dim taper had
Only to walk by, though their Light was bad
They walked as well, as that could guide; and though
They wanted that bright Sun, which we do know,
They God in some part knew: whether these be
Condemned to Hell for all Aeternity?
Or whether God his Mercy has not shown
To them, and brought them to this Region?
Where they by Christ might saved be, se'ing none
Are saved but by blessed Him alone?
Seeing the Lord's more merciful, than to
Require of them, more than they ever knew:
Being Transgression's not without a Law;
And none damned for breach of what he never saw;
This I would ask Man, but I think that he
Sarcasmes would return, not answer me,
Let not the World presume, nor yet surmise,
Because the Heathens works they equalize
That they shall hith '^ attain: God has an higher
And brighter Light gi'n to the World; Require
He therefore now does at the Hands of Men,
Far greater things, than he expected then.
Man's Talent's greater now: the Stars upon
The Heathens only, now on Men the Sun
Does clearle shine: Who falls for want of sight
God pitty'd; but will not now men have Light.
But let us proceed for I have stayed too long
To speak of what the World does count a Song.
The Pilgrim hearing this, his eyes withdrew,
And bid the Spirits E^ga^lule adieu
Now hand in hand they went, but straight they were
Come to the entrance of another Sphere.
The place seemed like a grave; 'twas where such dead
As he was, used to be buried.
The Pilgrim looked in, but in the place
Nothing but a most horrid darkness was,
Which equaliz'd the pitchy clouds, which fume
At black Avernus from Hel's horrid womb.
'Twas Taen^^us or the entrance into Hell,
Or from the third, to the first Principle.
But thus the Angel to the P^lgrim said;
This is the grave in which no man was laid
Before the mighty Son of God; 'twas here
His sacred Virgin Limbs first laid were:
Here was he buried, here must also thou
Into this Grave, as he did, enter too.
I Will be thy Guide, fear not, thy Coat will keep
Off all the vapors of the internal deep
From hurting thee. This said, they both into
That Cave of darksome Night together go.
Fancy not Reader, that our Pilgrim crept
Into some Cave, or down some Cavern stepped:
Or that the Worlds by outward distance are
Disjoined: they are contingent every where,
And yet there is a Gulf between: but this
The entrance is into that dark A^ysse,
A sinking down from the third Principle
Toward the Center of the deepest Hell.
The darkest pitchy Night that ever was,
Her sa^ses could not to this horrid place
Compare: This is the Fountain (when she lacks)
Whence she expromes her jetty deep-dy'd blacks.
Here it is she dips her inky Mantles; Here
In soot, or pitch she dies, what she does wear:
Hence she those black Screens has, which from our sights
Often times do hide Heaven's little twinkling Lights.
But the happy Pilgrim, and the Angel here
In spite of all Hel's pitch their Way see clear.
No Carbuncle, whose fiery Rays does Night
Chase from his presence, ever gave such Light,
As that Purpurean Garment he had on,
Which like ten thousand joined Rubine's shon;
And those bright Rays which from the Angels Face
Calligenous Night did from their presence chase.
Backward she flew, as they approached, and ^ell
Just at the Feet of the great Prince of Hell.
But as they onward went, a pointed Ray
Beamed near the place, where all the Devils lay:
Hell started back, and all the damned Crew
Under dark inky waves together flew.
Nothing mo^e terrible is to their sight,
Than the least beaming, or a Ray of Light.
Great PLUTO trembled, and his Throne did shake,
He feared least Christ another Voyage make
Might th'rough his Kingdom, to and pains to pains,
C^oser Confinement, and more chains to chains.
But having drunk a draught of Stygian Nectar,
He ^wrod^ grows: Am not I Hell's PROTECTOR?
(...) he, Did not I dare at once to fly
Against Heaven's own Face, and all his Hierarchy?
Do I so many Legions Command?
And do I here sneaking, and trembling stand?
And dare not venture to see who these be,
That dare to venture on my Hell, and me?
That dare in Hostile manner thus invade
My Realm, and Captivate with Light my shade?
I Will see who it is: If 't be not him I fear
So much, my looks shall hence all others scare.
With that an hideous rore he gave, and from
All parts of Hell Legions of Devils come,
These hellish Troops follow their Princely Lord,
Clothed with the darkest pitch Hell could afford;
Each had a shield lined with ten thousand shades*
To keep off Light; when it their eyes invades.
Yet not secure, each mus^les up his sight,
With Tartarus's black Lawnes, and furrs of Night.
These met the Pilgrim, but no sooner had
His eyes, and garment their blessed Beamings shed
Upon these Troops, but they fall back, and rend
Hel's strong Foundations, with the cries they send
From their black throats: Rage issued from their eyes,
And from their mouths and tongues fell Blasphemies.
They knew that bloody Dye, that Robe was feared,
The sight of it Dis, and his Troops thus scared.
O who can paint the noise of Hell, the roar
Great Satan gave the neighbor Pillars tore.
Ten hundred thousand rattling chains did clink,
Th'rough the place flew a Sulphurian stink,
Thinking the Pilgrim with the stinch to choke:
From their mouths flew Volumns, and clouds of smoke.
This sight amazed our Traveller, the smell
Of Sulphur, Brimstone, and of Nitre fell
Out of those clouds; and all the stinking fume
Fly'ng th'rough the place, did to his nosethrils come.
His ears with curses, and with Blasphemy
Were filled; the clouds which all about did fly
Pressed th'rough his lips, and touching there his tongue,
With bitter horrid acritude it stung.
Strange pricking atoms, which did touch his skin
Invisibly annoyed him with their sting:
Whole streams of venom rouled at his feet,
Which mighty Pluto from his mouth had spit.
But all this while with hideous roars, and cries,
All the black Troops of Hell before him flies,
Rattling their chains, and to avoid his sight,
Wrapping themselves in smoaky clouds of Night.
But ^el's insernal m^ghty Prince, once more
His flying Troops stops with an hideous roar,
And Sak^ng his dire snaky Locks he cried:
Y^a migh^y Sons, and I great Prince of Pride,
Why flee we thus? By my great Iron Rod,
My Head, and Throne, it is not the Son of God
Who loaded these Imperial Hands with chains,
And whose great Power m' imperial might restraines.
This is some puny Saint, some counte^feit,
Whom Zeal has hither brought with hasty feet
To pass our Kingdom, unto Paradise;
M^ thinks we should not daunted thus agnize
Hi^ power: Ah! were not for that cursed Coat
He wears, how soon l'd cut his Saintships throat.
But seeing it is not Christ himself, I vow
I (...) to any of his Train to bow.
He cannot hurt us, let us show him then,
That we have power to drive him back ag'en.
Let Us 'sright him if we can: Torment alas!
To see our Foes th'rough our own Realm to pass,
Spite of our teeths! I am resolved to try't
With him, and though I ^al I Will show my spite,
This said his rallied Troops their Horns do whet
Upon a Rock of Adamant; and set
Their stoutest courage up: great LUCIFER
A beam of Iron in his hand does bear,
His eyes like Lamps were; from his nosethrils flew
Black clouds of smoke, his Whale-like mouth did spew
I ^ames like a Furnace; and an hundred shoales
Of melting bullets, and red glowing coals.
His Iron Mace against a Rock he struck,
And a great Lake of fire, and brimstone took
^^s rise from thence, which spreading all about,
Up to the knees he wadeth hurtlesse th'rough't.
Thus he appears, and thinks by this to 'fray
The unmoved Travell^^ out of his Way;
^ut that blessed Robe in which he was bewrap'd,
The Pilgrim dauntlesse, and in safety kept.
The hellish lightning from his Head was beat
Back, by the golden Bays that compassed it:
And maugre Hell, and all its power could do,
Victoriously, unstop'd he passed th'rough:
For Hell still dazeled at the Light he bore
Flung down his fires, and ^led as on^e before.
There was no Guilt for Hell to fasten on;
For if there had, Hell had the Conquest won:
And if there had, the Cherub's flaming Sword
To Paradise no passage would afford.
For now he saw the passage filled with flame,
Which from a supercilious Angel came. See more page 7 2.

A mighty Sword he held, from whence a stream
Of flaming Fire th'rough the place did beam:
Into 't our Pilgrim went, and bravely bold,
Walked th'rough the midst; and like seven times tried Gold
Shon brighter than those flames. Untouched his hair
Was, and the garment which his shoulders bare.
To him bowed down the Angel-Centinal,
And gave free passage to the brazen Wall.
Now was his heart amazed, when he saw
The separation placed by Heaven's hard Law;
'Twixt man, and Paradise: on heaps there was
A mountanous ruin of the sellid'st Brass,
Which like huge Mountains heaped together, and
As Monuments lay of some mighty Hand.
For part of that great Wall (which was so high
That its proud top our Pilgrim with his eye
Could not attain) it was; now down, a Gap
It left; which never could be mended up.
After the Pilgrim all amazed had viewed
That Sconce of Brass, he to the Angel su'd,
To let him know by what Hand built it was,
And what strength had broke down that league-thick Brass.
The Angel who such favors never denied
To him, after a little pause replied.
You stand amazed at these ruins; I
As much amazed at Man's impiety
Do stand: for this immense and mighty breach
To thankless man Aeternal Love does preach:
And yet ungrateful He, abase the Power
Does of his only and great Savior.
I tremble now I think how some men dare
Speak slightly of him, who is Heavens own heir.
How some men dare, O horrid! to deny
His Godhead: fearful! fearful Blasphemy!
How some Men dare to say blessed Jesus did
Do nothing for them, when h' at Salem died.
Would all such now were here to see the Power,
He had, and how he was a Savior,
To all that ever saved were. Would Heaven
Had me to trumpet This Commission given,
Th'rough all the quarters of the World IN d sound
This act; the effect of Love, and Strength profound.
Would now the Winds th'rough every Land might blow
My words, that all, what I tell thee might know*
That so they might never hear blessed Iesu's Name,
But their proud Hearts, and Knees bow at the same.
Consider well this brazen Wall; your eyes
Are too too weak unto the top to rise:
How thick it is! Behold how vast! What one
Could ever climb over it, or break it down?
Could all the World, and if they hither came
With Catapults, or Tower-shaking Rams?
Or their vast Bombards, damage this great Wall?
Or a thousand shot make any sign at all?
How vain would all their strength be! Jesus then
As more Love, so more strength had than all Men:
'Twas his own Hand, and his own Hand alone,
That made this breach, that pulled this Brass-wall down.
Pilgrim attend! The Protoplast once did
On Earth behold that Realm, which now lies hid,
That Realm to which we press, blessed Paradise,
Adam beheld on Earth with virgin Eyes.
The first, and second Principles did lie
Conjoined to the third, in Harmony.
These were disjoined by Adam's wretched sin,
And Harmony stepped out, and discord in.
A sensual ^ast it was by which he lost
That place, which Iesu's dearest Blood has cost,
For to redeem again for us, God's Wrath
And Justice be'ing awaked against them both.
Both Adam, and his Eve; He them cast out
From thence, then walled it, with this Wall about.
The Guardian Cherubim be placed then, Genesis 3. 24.

With a versatile Sword to keep out Men.
O how the Devil rejoiced to see this Ba^
To Bliss: Mine own (he cried) all Mortals are:
None can break this I Am sure; none now shall see,
Nor into Paradise admitted be.
Was it not sure enough? what Man could pass
Through this Fire, and over this Wall of Brass?
And thus was Man excluded Paradise,
But less obscure, and trulier thus it is:
After that Unity had broken been,
And Discord introduced by the sin
Of Adam; strait the second Principle,
Drew from the Third, and in its Ether fell:
To its own Center fled; the World bereft
Often, was as well as Ad^m naked left.
Then the first Principle of Wrath was seen,
Which strait the third, and second stepped between;
Th'rough which till Christ no man could ever pass:
This is the Cherub, and the wall of Brass.
This is the flaming Sword, which turns about,
To keep of Paradise all Mortals out.
And thus excluded they had ever been,
If Christ had not in Mercy entrance given.
In fullness then of Time, down from above,
To take an humane Soul came mighty LOVE,
The second Person in the Trinity,
(O sacred! and thrice sacred Mystery!)
To make a way for poor excluded Man,
Th'rough Hell to Heaven, for this end he came.
This none but mighty He could do, and this
Had ^e not done, Man never had tasted Bliss.
When he therefore the Cup of Wrath had drunk
Upon the Cross, and into Death was sunk
Into these deeps he came, and that Way too,
By which from earth we hither came but now.
The common Road to Hell this is not, still
None this Way go, but against Sathan's will.
This is the private path th'rough Hell, to Heaven,
By Christ to those who his steps follow, given.
This is the Path, by his blessed death made Good,
Gained with pain, purchased with so much blood.
This is the Path which Hell still strives to hide,
Least Mortals by 't to Paradise should slide.
This is the Path which shows Christ's Power: It is
The Path which leads from miseries, to Bliss.
A spacious Road leads unto Pluto's Court,
On the left hand; where Mortals much resort;
Paved with pleasures, and external Bliss,
With Riches, honors, and such baits it is.
This Road brings to a Gate of Aebony,
Whose lofty portals, mounted are on high,
Whose wide-leav'd Gates by Pluto's strict command
Both Night, and Day, for ever open stand.
So wide they are, a World at once may in
Get, but a m^te cannot return ag'in. Noctes atque dies patet atria Janua Di^i^.

Such is the Hospitality of Hell,
Gratis all Men may there, for ever dwell.
This is the Gehenna; this the Lions Den
From whence there can be no Redemption.
This Road Christ's sheep do shun, for that Way is
The way to Torment, not the Path to Bliss.
'Till Christ this Way made, there no other was;
Therefore when first he came into this place,
Hell was amazed; and its foundation shook
Its mighty Pi^lars all assunder broke.
Great LUCIFER fell from his Aebon Seat,
And 's neck subjected unto Iesu's feet.
The trembling Devils roared, and with a Yell
Upon their faces before Jesus fell,
Then with ten thousand chains of Adamant
He loaded them: and them of Room did scant,
Ty'ng them move strictly to their Center, and
Enforcing them to yield to his Command.
He broke the Power Hell had over Man,
That by his might he might triumph ag'en.
His eyes tormented Hell; his very breath,
Assunder broke the cruel jaws of Death.
The damned yelled, and his sacred Sight
That cursed crew put int' an horrid fright.
Then he the Dev'ls restrained, so that they could
Not hurt those who this path trod if they would.
Then th'rough the Cherub's flaming Sword he went
Unhurt; to whom his Head the Angel bent
Down to his Feet: the flaming Fire no power
Had the least hair of his Head to devour.
Scarce was there any thing that Jesus did
For Man's Salvation but 'twas typifi'd
Long ever he came in flesh; and all before
Of Note; some shadow of this Substance bore:
And it was fit that Heaven's high Majesty,
Should into Earth by Prod^ums ushered be.
How did the Priestly Ceremonies too,
His Office, and his Acts exactly show.
How did the Prophets prophecy of Him:
How was his acts praeacted ever he came,
But all in shadows; He the Substance was,
And they all vanished, when he came in place,
So did the brazen Serpent, show that he
For Soul, and Body should Physician be.
So did the Scapegoat to the Jews declare,
That he theirs, and the whole Worlds Sins should bear.
So Joshua, who to Canaan led the Jews,
That Christ his lead shall to his Kingdom shows.
So Dav^d, who Readiness fury did remove,
Shows that Christ should Wrath overcome by Love.
So Isaac offered did typifie
That offered Jesus for the World should dye.
So Jonas buried in the Whale did tell
The World, that Christ descend should into Hell,
And that he should arise again. And so
Were Shadrach, Mesheck, and Abednego.
When in the seaven-times heated Furnace they
W'thout hurt or singing of their hair did stay,
A Type of Iesu's walking th'rough this flame
Of Wrath; th'rough which helped by his Power we came*
So Sampson's strength did Iesu's typifie;
Who at his feet bowed Hel's great Majesty:
And when on his broad shoulders he did lay
Strong Gaza in the Heb. signifies Strength.
Gaza's Gates, and bear them quite away,
Of Christ's great power, and mighty strength He was
A Type, who bore away these Gates of Brass,
When Hell thought to imprison him: Alone
He by his strength pulled this Brass Fortress down.
For when that he came near, he put his Hand,
Unto this Wall which as a Bar did stand.
Between the World, and Paradise: straight shook
Its strong Foundations when his hold he took
On it; strait trembled every part, and down
To Iesu's feet fell his high-crested Crown.
Then was this breach made which you see, and then*
A way was made to Paradise ag'en,
Which had so long denied been, to all
The progeny of Adam, since his fall.
O glorious! yea thrice glorious happy Breach!
By which fallen Man again to Heaven may reach!
O Noble Work! O mighty strength of the
Blessed Son of God's glorious Humanity!
'Twas his Humanity this work did do,
Or else no passage here had been for you,
Nor for an' humane Soul. O David's Stemm!
O Jesus who died at Jerusalem!
Can any Man speak such fell Blasphemy
To say that all that is saved, not 's saved by thee?
Dear Pilgrim 'twas none but that Christ alone,
That for Man has wrought this Salvation:
But 'count it not a vain Tautologie
If I once more relate it unto thee:
Thus in a word it was. The blessed Love,
Upon the Wrath its gentle self did move:
Both Principles were reconciled: In one
Were joined, in an happy union
The first and second Principles; arise
Immediately from them did Paradise.
Thus Wrath, and Love by Christ we reconciled.
Who brought forth Paradise, an happy child,
Unto which place thou now shall go; and th'rough
This happy breach, which Christ has made for you.
Mundus Luminosus, vel Paradisiacus.
HEre lacks an Angel's Tongue to Trumpet forth,
In his best Lays, blessed Paradise's worth;
That by those sweet strains he a taste might give
To you, what pleasures there for ever Live.
Here lacks a Tasso, or a Bartas, or
A Spencer's Muse, a Quarles, or Silvester:
Or some such Laureate: But since their skill
Is wanting to my Pen, accept my Will:
For though my Muse cannot reach their lofty vein,
Child-like the Truth speaks in a stammering strain.
Thus far sh' has waded, and she th'rough must go,
Although the style is for the Theme too low.
The horrid Mansion of Aeternal Night
Our Pilgrim now forsakes; the blessed Light
Of Paradise his eyes salutes; the smell
Of Arabie, drives back the sent of Hell.
Through that breach made by the Hand of Love,
Still by the Angel guided he does move,
And mounting up from that infernal pit,
Upon the skirts of Paradise does sit.
O blessed rise! no foes he now may fear,
For over Hell, and Death he 's Conqueror.
This Resurrection is the first, and He
That rises thus may ever happy be. Rev. 20. 6.

Our Pilgrim's nosethrils which Hel's horrid stink
Of Sulphur had drunk, Odors now do drink
Of Paradise; now from Aelysium
Clouds of perfumes, and rapting smells do come.
But whilst upon the very verge they stayed,
The Angel unlocked his Ruby Lips and said.
O newborn Pilgrim, thou the Grave have seen,
Thou know now what it is to be born again.
This is the happy, and the blessed state,
Where thou may say thou art Regenerate.
Thou art a child become, and now must learn
Those Lessons which thy eyes did never discern.
Whilst in the World, and in thy sins thou were.
Christ is thy Master, thou his Scholar art.
But in one moment thou shall profit more
Now, than in all thy Life thou did before.
Thou here shall gain more in an hour, than all
The Scholars in their great Lycaeums shall.
No vain Disputes shall studied be, by thee,
But God, and Nature shall thy study be:
To such as thee, he gives leave to go
Among his Treasures, and his secrets know.
There 's not a Leaf, there 's not a spire of Grass,
There 's not a clod of Earth, nor Tree, but has
A Tongue to speak, which does Arcana's show;
But the ignorant does not their Lauguage know.
Nor can they know the clothing they have on,
Till they wash in the Fountain of the Sun,
Over which the Golden Apples hang, but this
By a never sleeping Dragon, watched is.
Defiled persons never can come to 't:
Polluted hands can never tuck those fruit.
To thee, and such as thee these things are shown:
Who live in Paradise unseen, unknown.
But let me warn thee Pilgrim, that thou may
Not of that Tree, as once did Adam taste,
Lest thou do lose those Blessings which the Lord,
If thou fal'st not, will unto thee afford:
Those secret blessings which we do not dare
For fear of curses to the World deelare.
The Tri^une God has generated from
Aeternity, in 's own Aeternal Womb
Two Principles (so called because they be
The out-spoken Word of the great Deity,
So their PRINCIPIUM is (else they have none)
Their breathing out, or manifestation)
The Dark, and Light: That we call First, and This,
The holy Light World, and the Second is.
God in the First is known a Judge severe,
Angry, and Jealous, Wrathful and Austere;
But in the Second he does solely move
In Light, in Meekness, gentleness and Love:
The First gives being to the Dark-world, and
The Light does in the Second's Essence stand.
Nor can First Principle.
that be called Evil: Harmonize
The Second with 't, and it makes Paradise:
For it is as 'twere the Life of it; its seat,
And office there, is as in Man the heat
Or Spirit, which his body quickens, and
Makes the joints so nimbly move, and Bend;
But let this be w'thout its due Temprament,
Unharmoniz'd; and the other humors spent,
How soon it Rages, and to f^^e does turn,
And with intolerable Fevers burn
Distempered Man: So the first Principle
If separate, and that the Second quell
Does not its acritude; it then is like
Nay, it is the Fire which does the damned strike.
In discord In the inward ground of Nature, from whence our outward Sulphur,
Salt and Mercury, as also other external things proceed, according to the
opinion of that highly illuminated Man J. B.

Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury,
Is Hell: but Paradise in Harmony.
For this end therefore did the mighty Lord
Them Generate, that they might still accord,
And Harmoniz'd, might make this Paradise, In which should spring Aeternal
Loves, and Joys.
Thus did the Tri-une God himself display
In making of this place this Orb of Day;
For here the Spirit's influence does flow,
And the great Wonders of the Godhead show.
God willed not Hell then for the damned crew
(Although their Fate Aeternally he knew)
Nor the black Devils did he so Create.
In the first Principle, or Wrathful state
No one he made: But a transcendant bright,
And mighty Prince; He in the Orb of Light
Or second Principle, Great LUCIFER
Created; here also created were
All other Angels: But he on the Throne
Sat as a King, with great Dominion.
To him we ^ll did Homage do, and he
Ruled the Princes of each Hierarchy.
And this was Heaven, the Aeternal mansion
Of God, where stands blessed Iesu's Throne.
Now here, and in this Principle of Light
He only should have shown the Power, and might
Of Love in Paradise; which then was, and
Where the External World does now, did stand.
But this great Prince of Light now Hel's great King
Into that dismal Realm himself did bring;
For in the fires mighty strength he flew,
Scorning the Second Principle; subdue
The same he would; into the First therefore
He and his following Angels hurled were,
Where they in Anguish, and the Fier's might
Between the third, and second have their site:
Where they for ever must endure with those
Souls, who with that same Principle do close.
Thus Hell did come to be: But we who stood
Enjoy unutterable Sweets; the Food
Immortal eat, the Heart of God, for that
For ever sealed to us our blessed State.
But now when Lucifer in Pride did rove,
The first and second Principles did move,
From whence a Third then came; the First did then
To operate upon it strait begin,
And like it self by its attracting force
It Rocks and stones did form; its bitter source,
The whole mass into such stuff would have brought,
But that the second Principle then wrought,
And harmonizing of the First begat
A watery fluid substance, on which sat
And moved the blessed Spirit, and from that
He Heavens did create, and separate
From the subsiding Earth: The upper Sea
He from the lower did divide: That Is the
Material Water, did divide from those
Which being gave to them, from whence arose
All that on Earth does spring: It Is truly said
God made from Water all that ever was made.
And yet we cannot it Water call: but yet
Nothing can better be compared to it.
The lower waters Congregate: The Earth
Then to all Plants gave an apparent birth*
Thence Essence visible became, for these
Stood in their forms in blessed Paradise,
As the Idea's of what ever was
Or shall upon this Earthly Globe take place.
Thus is the World Aeternal, and shall be
Never dissolved to a nullity:
For the great God will never annihilate
The least thing that he ever did create,
But yet the substance perish shall, but the
Forms shall remain unto Aeternity:
Some in one Principle, some in the other,
When all things shall return to their first mother.
On the fourth Day, after the Third-Dayes even
The Sun, the Moon, and all the Lights of Heaven
Created were; the first Day's flitting Light
Now fixed was, and in the Sun took site.
The Heaven impregnates then the female Earth,
And first her Seas to Fish, and Fowl gave birth.
As Soon as God his mighty FIAT spoke:
Then from the Earth all living Creatures brake,
Made by the same Hand that the Earth had made,
And from the Earth's own Mother being had;
And yet the Earth was their own Mother too,
They from her Mother, in her womb indue
Four Elements, which when the FIAT was
Spoke, Essence into living Forms did pass.
And thus the World, and all things God had made,
Was Good, and in 't no evil being had.
But the bright Throne from whence the Prince of H^ll
(As I have told you) into darkness fell
Stood empty still, and to supply his place
There not one Angel 'counted worthy was.
Therefore conspire the Holy Trinity
To make an Image of the Deity.
This Man we call; to whom a Soul was given
The perfect Image of the God of Heaven,
He was ordained (for God did him prefer)
^or to poss^ss the Throne of ^uciser,
Had he but stood. Of Earth this man was made,
But not of such on which you Mortals tread,
It is an Earth which may in secret 'bide
Under the covering of your fleshly hide:
It Is such an Earth that Stone can penetrate,
It Is such an Earth as has in Heaven a seat:
It Is such an Earth as Man's blessed Savior
Put on, when he rose from the Grave in Power:
As clear as c^ystal, and a^ thin as air,
As bright as Venus, or the Morning Star.
From the same Mother of your Earth it came,
In which there harmonized does remain
The quintessence of the four Elements,
In which there are no disagreeing rents:
Such was the Body of the first made Man,
Such clothing his ennobled Soul had on.
In this the Soul the Image of our God
By the Holy Spirit breathed in abode.
His Soul (as you'rs are) was created from
Three Principles, and from three Worlds did come:
Of all she did partake, and seemed to be
Conjoined Rays, or one Beam made out of Three.
Man being thus created our great King,
The Lord of all things, him to Earth did bring:
Unto the new-made World; and there his God
In Aeden bid him to make his abode.
Then in that place this inner World so gay,
Its everlasting Beauties did display,
This place to which thou now art come, did there
With all its lovely Beauties then appear,
In this did Adam live, this is the place
Which ever since was called Paradise.
God had appointed this Felicity,
In Aeden only at that time to be,
Because he knew that Adam there would fall*
Which made him not to spread it over all
The new made World: If ^dam had brought forth
In innocence then over all the Earth.
Had this World opened been, and which one day
Th'rough all the whole Globe shall it self display.
Aeden was not the Paradise, for there
All sorts of Beasts, and other Creatures were;
Satan had power to enter there, but in
Blessed Paradise he, nor the Beasts were seen.
Adam alone did dwell in Paradise,
In Aed^n; Aeden held this World of Joys;
Here Adam dwelt, and happy had he stood,
For neither evil, nor the munda^e good
Should he have known; for whilst he here abode
He should have pressed after the Heart of God:
His mind to the Aeternal World alone
Should have, and not unto the dark World flown,
Nor to the earthly Orb: He should indeed
The Wonders of the Light World have displayed.
But down a precipice himself he hurled;
After the Soul of the terrest^ial Wo^ld
He longed, which was the Tree forbid, and when
He tasted the material fruit, he then
Was captived by the Spirit of that Orb,
And was endued with a fleshly garb.
And had his Soul not lived in that suit,
He had been m^tamo^phiz'd to a Brute.
Thus Adam fell, thus Paradise and all
His issue feel the effects of his sad fall.
Thus Adam lost that Body which he had
Before he with his fleshly one was clad:
And so's Soul was, as all the Souls of Men
Imprisoned are within a fleshly Den.
To gain that Body then Man's work should be,
Which Adam lost by the forbidden Tree,
The which must cloth the Soul when she does fly
The Tabernacle of Mortality;
If not she naked goes to Hell, and there
Does some black, horrid, ater garment wear.
Thus our King Jesus when he triumphed had
Over Hell, and Death his humane Soul he clad
With that b^ig^t ^ody, the (...);
Which co^ld ^ppear al^ho the doo^s were fast
Among his Loved Disc^ples. In this place
He (...) days after his rising was.
Her^ in th^s O^b he stayed, t^ll he did move
Into the bosom of (...) Love:
T^ll his ^s^^nsion d^y, till he on high
(...) into Heaven's Aeternal Glory fly.
T^en (...) Humanity he in the Th^one
That (...) di^ once pos^^ss ^at down,
And there he (...) at God's right H^nd, and makes
At^on^ment for his dear Beloveds sakes.
O bl^ss^d Jesus! were it not for thee
Not ^ne poor mo^tal ever could saved be.
^ha^ (...) lost, thou have regained, and now
The Wo^ld waits when thou thy great Power wilt show,
When (...) in Glory wilt come from the skies,
An^ (...) ^^nve^^ into a Paradise.
D^ar (...) I decl^re these things to thee,
That tho^ fore (...), also fore-^rm'd might be:
Fo^t (...) thou ca^'st not here, as Adam did
(...) to mo^tality, ye^ here forbid
Tho^ (...) to join unto the ^o^ld's great Sp'right:
For t^o^gh tho^ cann'st no^ to Eternal Night
Fa^^ back; y^^ thou that Body may n't indue
Which otherw^se may gr^nted be t^ you.
Yo^ may not pass into the uppe^ Sph^ar,
To (...) the ^lories, and the Won^e^s there,
If that you should upon the O^b below
Offe^ your Will, and thirsty mind to throw,
Till (...) shall flesh put off, Your mind and will
After (...) press forward still
(...), for there (...) fix^tion, and ^here
In ^l^^y all the (...) new Bodies wear.
(...) the ^l^asure of that love
Which (...) time thy fleshly cloath^s remove
W^ll, and that tho^ may never garments want,
Unto thy Soul a ^lorious Body grant.
(...) thy mind upon (...) set
That thou in brightness to her Court may get:
She question^ess whilst thou art here, will spread
Her B^unti^s, and shower down upon thy Head
Her everlasting Graces; naught denied
Shall be by her, who is designed thy Bride.
But now surveigh thou shall with thy own eyes,
The splendid Beauties of our PARADISE.
PARADYSUS.
THis said he gave a Hand of blushing snow
Into the Pilgrim's; hand in hand they go,
In^o a Labyrinth of rapting sweets,
Where Joy in an Ecstatic Rapture greets
His welcomed Soul; where his amazed eyes
Saluted are with such vatieties
Of all deligh^ful Objects, that he knows
Not how for to Contemplate all he throws
His Orbs upon. So pleasing was that Book
That on which side he knew not first to look.
Wit^ cursory eyes at first them all he viewed,
And then his sight a second time renewed.
The air was there serene, no clouds did dare
Upon his Caerule Marble Front appear;
Ten tho^sand smiles lay wrapped in that blew,
Which heats, nor colds, nor such strange changes knew*
One Temp' rament, the which no storms assail,
Nor winds disturb; a cool Zeph^rian gale
Only salutes, was in that place; a still
Crystalline Dew, such as from Hermon Hill
Descends, fell on the Herbs, and Trees that there
^n green, silver, and golden Robes appear.
Such silver clouds as made a Chariot
For Jesus when he from Mount Olivet
Flew to the Habitation of his Father,
^id here, and there with lustrous splendour gather,
Their Cynthean beams dispersing up and down,
^n Circles, brighter than Ariadn's Crown.
The Aeternal Heaven's glorious beamings shon
Upon that Orb; an everlasting Sun
To it they were, which never 'rose nor set,
Nor changes here of Night and Day permit.
'Twas always Day, 'twas always Noon, it was
There always Sun shine in that springing place.
All the Idea's of what we behold
Upon this Orb, shon there in purest gold,
In greater claritude, and brightness far
Than the Night's Goddess, or the evening Star.
O the sweet Joys our Pilgrim's swelling Heart
Ready to burst, did to his eyes impart!
The Lively Rays that darted were from them
Told that his Soul now bathed In Joye's sweet Stream.
A verdant Meadow first did cheer his eyes,
With several colored gay varieties;
Amongst the green were sparsed here and there,
Gold-tincted Flowers: Purple, silvered, fair
Blew, Yellow, Orange, Lilied white, and red,
With thousand Colors else the Earth be spread.
So rare a show they made, so great delight
They gave that our Pilgrim ravished quite.
Alas our Rose though here she seem a Queen,
To Death her self would blush, had she but seen
How far the meanest Dasie here surpast,
And how her best blush by it was disgraced.
Had but our Lilly been compared to those
Which there grew, she for shame her maiden snows
In melting tears would on the Earth have shed,
And sorrowful hung down her shamed Head.
Alas brisk Pink, or sell, or Blush compare,
But to the meanest of the flowers there,
Thou would be forced to yield the Palm to them,
And seem, as do to thee base Dasies seem.
Our sprightly Green-grass green, compared unto
That Grasse's luster bears a yellow Hew,
And as much difference, or more is seen,
Than is 'twixt Autumn's yellow, and Springs green.
The Gold-strip'd Tulips which do court our eyes
In the first Spring, with rare varieties,
Are b^t the shadows of those flowers which Grace
The Grass-green footstool of that happy place.
The Angel pressing hard the Pilgrim's Hand,
Se'st thou (sai'd He) how still these flnowers do stand?
With what varieties they are indu'd?
How Beauty by each other is renewed?
How comely all in order placed, do praise
Their great Creator with their unheard Lays?
Just so the Saints do dwell, in this blessed Sphere,
In such varieties, and Love appear.
No dissonant murmurs from their mouths proceed,
Nor does their difference, a difference breed:
For where would all their Beauties be, if they
Should not in various works themselves display?
All several beauties have, and yet they be
Though several Beauties, One, in Harmony.
But th'rough that place where Heavenly Flora had
The Earth Caelestial, with her beauties clad;
Where so many thousand painted Stars were seen,
For ever fixed in a sky of Green,
Run a soft River of dissolyed Pearl,
Whose waves did into Crystal Ringlets 'twerle,
Without the help of blasts, for none came there
But what from Angels mouths emitted were.
The Fount from whence this Crystal River came,
The Throne of God is, and the spotless Lamb;
From thence those streams which does this River feed,
As clear as Crystal, soft as Wool proceed;
From the upper Region unto this they flow,
Uniting Heaven above, to Heaven below.
Down Crystal Rocks, the Crystal Waters glide,
And pearly streams, over pearly Pibbles slide,
Creating by their falls so pleasing noyses,
That they for Bases serve to Angels voices.
On each side of the green-fring'd banks there grows,
The candid Lily, and the blushing Rose,
Fairer than ever the Earthly Valley bore;
Pestum, nor Sharon ever such sweets once wore.
The bleeding Hyacinths, and fond Narcisses,
Hung over the bank, whose Heads the water kisses*
Leaving her Pearls: for to renew their youth,
The precious Tokens of her moister Mouth.
Chaplets of Violets crowned the River's brink,
Whose ^^embl^ng blew heads of the Waters drink,
And for each sip, their purple mouths receive,
They in ^eq^ital their perfumes to give.
Into the C^ystal st^eam the Angel goes,
And liquid P^a^ls upon our Pilg^im throws;
In Li^es blessed Waters, in this Living stream,
Where (...) on Waves ride he baptized him:
Where (...) kisses to^ch'd his skin, thus he
Knew what with Wa^er 'twas baptized to be
His Ruby Lips dren^h'd in the C^ystal waves
The blessed Water he with joy ^eceives:
He (...) drinks, and now he will thirst no more,
After Earth's Riches, or her golden Over;
Her honors, pleasures, Gold, nor Silver, nor
A thous^nd Ea^thly Diadems compare
May with the least drop of this blessed stream:
No, they are dung to it, they Gold to them.
When out he came those Living Waves had thrown,
He saw, his youth and purile days again
Upon his back; his harder skin grew (...),
And his dimn'd ^yes obstructing scales had dof't.
His feebled joints, and leather nerves grew strong,
He went in old but now he comes out young,
He needs no Physic, this h^d all made good.
H^s Health restored, as well as youth renew^d.
Such v^rtue has this stream, which when he knew,
His head he humbly did to Jesus bow:
His Lips in praises blessed his holy Name,
Who him had counted wo^thy of the same.
But on each side the River, smiling stood
A Grove of La^^els, and of t^ller Wood;
Whose bl^ssed branches seemed their heads to shake*
Unto the (...) tones the waters make.
All T^ees that we upon our Earth can spy
Grew there, in their essential purity;
The best of ours to the worst of them,
Would as the Hawthern to the Cherry seem,
Or as the Bramble to the precious (...),
Or as terrestrial Trees, to Trees div^ne.
No evil Tree, nor quality was there,
Divine (and yet s^bstantial) they were.
When near our Pilgrim came, he cast his eyes
Upon these flourishing Trees of P^rad^se.
An Emrauld green upon their Leaves did dwell,
Which never from their happy Branches fell:
Some edged with silver, some were stripped with Gold,
And Pearls instead of berries Bays did hold.
No Tree was barren, not a fruitless bough,
All sorts of fruit in purity there grew;
Sweet blossoms mingled with the riper fruit:
At once the Trees ware May's and August's sui^.
A Crystal dew fell from the E^ernal sky,
Which on the Leaves like Eastern Pearls did lie:
A threefold suit the verdant ^ranches wore;
For Pearls, fruit, flowers they together hoar:
And when they moved, were by Angelic breath
A showe^ of Pearl they sent the heavenly Earth.
But whilst ou^ Pilgrim pleased with this sight
Gazed on these Groves, a gale did gently smite
The laded bows; from whose soft pressing them
More than Arabian Diapasma's came:
For every leaf as well as flower, and fruit
Such odor yields, as we have none like to 't.
Arabian gales which kiss the Spiceful Trees.
Breath Hircish odors if compared to these.
This gale of sweets did least the P^lgrim's smell,
And makes amends for those foul blasts in Hell.
Led by his blessed Guardian, he Th'rough
Those verdant, and thrice sacred Groves does go;
The boughs as he past by a whispering make,
And seem his welcom^ in their tongue to speak.
The Path with a green Velvet Carpet spread
Was; kissing Palms and Laurels ore his head
Arched a continual Bowr; a pleasant sound
More sweet than Philomelan strains, ran round
The blessed Wood, for on the tender sprays
Ten thousand Birds chaunt out continual Lays.
But near the River stood a stately Tree,
Who Queen and Mistress seemed there to be,
The rest her servants, for they all stood there
At a meet distance, ^or to honor her.
This was the sacred Tree of Life, upon
Whose boughs twelve sorts of fruit immortal hung.
Spread was her arms, and lofty was her Head
Each golden bran^h her neighbor seemed to wed,
And in an happy Conspiration, made
Upon the grass a very pleasing shade.
This was the Queen of Trees, the groves which there
So flourished, by her immortal were,
To her all Trees that in that place did grow,
Their verdure, beauty, and their Life did owe.
Strait, and superb was her blessed Bole; each bough
Was dressed in green, in gold, and silver too:
A radiant luster from whose Leaves did rise
Which glittered through the groves of Paradise,
Memphean Balsom, nor their Mummie, can*
So soon give ease unto dis^ressed Man,
Or from destruction preserve so long,
As one blessed Leaf which on those branches hung.
No desperate Disease, no mortal Wound,
There is, ^ev. 21.
but for them strait a cure may found
Be in the least piece of a Leaf pulled from
This sacred, and Salutiferous stem^,
The Panacea for all griefs; could men
But it attain: the dead should Live ag'en.
Alcinous's fruits, and the Hesperian,
Apples of Gold, though ten times better than
They were, are dung and dross if they compare
With the immortal Fruit these branches bare.
The fertile branches were for ever full,
Although ten times a day the Angels pull
The Fruit from every branch should, yet strait way
As full again they would their arms display.
To gather there would not decrease the store,
The more you gather, they increase the more.
So did Zarcphath's Widows meal, and oil,
The more they eat, the more increase the while.
Here 'twas the Pilgrim in an ecstasy
Fell, when the Tree of Life his eyes did see,
No longer was he able to keep in
His narrow heart the joys which there did spring,
Ravished with the excess of the profound
Content, and Bliss he fell unto the ground:
His Soul then to his eyes was flown, and left
All other parts had of her powers bereft.
His eyes were fixed upon that blessed Tree,
And thorough them his hungry Soul did flee;
They both so fast tied to the blessed Fruit
Were that he saw not those who now salute
Him did; he minded not their soft advance
Until the Angel pulled him from his trance.
See here (and as he spoke he raised him up)
The Heavenly Dryads, a Nymphean Troop
Of the caelestial Graces, hither come
To bid thee welcome are, unto their home.
This is their habitation, though they are
Pleased sometimes to see the lower Sphere,
Being thither sent, that they might helpful be
To heavenly Pilgrim's, as they were to thee.
At these words then the Pilgrim cast his eyes,
Upon these blessed Nymphs of Paradise,
But their bright luster so perstring'd his Orbs,
That he could searce behold their Queen-like garbs.
Their Beauties here at full they did display,
For here 'twas lawful in this Orb of Day,
Where they did fear no ravishment, that might
Accrue to them by their rare Beauties fight.
Should mortals so in Earth their beauties spy,
They would be subject to Idolatry.
Hel's Stygian Hags, when they on Earth appear,
Fictitious Bea^^ies on their Faces wear;
And all arts use, lest mortal eyes should see
Their horrid genui^e deformity.
But Paradises Nymphs dark Vailes do wear,
Because that Mortals cannot their Beauties bear,
So that on Earth, Hel's Haggs more fair do seem
With their false looks to blinded Man then them.
So Lust, and Pride, so H^res^^, and so
Craft, G^^le, and (...) more fair do show
To blinded mortals than Humility
Truth, simpleness, and downright Honesty.
But could Man see them in their proper Sphere,
He ever after would judge rightly here.
Those have their faces dipped in pitch, for hair
Ten thousand hissing, crawling Snakes they wear:
But these, whose beauties last, and never grow old,
Shine brighter than the Sun, in Robes of Gold,
Crowns on their Heads, for every one is there
A Queen though servant in the lower Sphere.
So they appeared now to our Pilgrim's eyes,
Clothed in the colors of blessed Parad^^^;
Resplendant Ha^o's round their faces sp^ead,
A Crown of gold, emboss't with Pearls the Head
Of every Nymph adorned; their Hair upon
Their shoulders like the beams of Phoebus shon.
Mo^e diamond sparkles in their eyes were seen,
Than has the third Orbs fair, and glittering Queen.
White, and red Roses in their cheeks did grow,
Ten thousand t^mes surpassing those below:
Smoother, and ^edder than the Coral were
Their Lips; their breath sweete^ than spiced air.
Most of them all below the Pilgrim had
Acquainted been with; but now they were clad
In Paradisaical Robes, now they did show
W'thout Vailes their beauties, them he scarcely knew.
But whilst his wandering Light, encountered theirs,
(...) in the head before the rest appears,
And in the name of all, salutes him (...).
Ha^ ^appy Pilgrim! Welcome unto us,
VVelcome to us thou art, I to this pl^ce
Thee welcome, in the Name of every GRACE.
This is our Region, here is the place where we
Do dwell; these Groves our habitations be:
No flattery's here, no (...), vain
D^scordial wel^omes: I did (...)
You know, believe me, as you 'ave ever done,
We do rejoy^e that we may wa^e upon
You in this Orb: therefore once more I shall
Thrice welcome bid you in the Name of all.
With this she bowed, then clipped the P^lgrim's neck,
And sealed a kiss of welcome on his cheek.
To whom the Pilgrim smiling thus replied,
Dear Truth I never started yet aside
From what thou did command, I did believe
You still; who'ld think that you would me deceive?
You nor my Guardian here (^ blame you both)
Concerning this place told me all the Truth;
Thou^h what you spoke is true, that is not enough:
For what things find I you n^'r told me of?
Accuse us not replied Truth again,
I hope you are no^ such a Tyrant grown
For to require us, that we should declare
Those things to you which past our reaches are.
It Is not the Tongues of Angels that the joys
And pleasures can declare of Paradise:
And as it was beyond our power to show,
So past our reach to comprehend them too.
Then blame us not dear Pilgrim if we be
Beyond, and better than our Word to thee.
With this the affresh embrace, but then came up
To clip him too, all the nymphean Troop.
Round him they run, and it a great while was
E're his embraces to them all could pass.
There Wisdom clipped him, Innocence hung
Upon his arm; whilst Peace, and Meekness wrung
His fingers: Faith, and Zeal held fast his Hand,
Light, Joy, Hope, Life together round him stand:
Uprightness, and the fair Nymph CHASTITY*
Obedience, LOVE, and pure Virginity,
Embrace him too, so Lowliness, and she
Nymphs-Courage, and swee^-look'd Humility
Did their devoyrs: Then Resignation,
And Prophecy with others to him run,
All do him hug; he does as much desire
The free embraces of this Virgin Q^^re.
As long, as ardent their embraces were
Nor could these outward signs their joys declare,
As fael laid upon the rising flames
A while depresses; but in higher stream^.
It causes strait the depressed flames to rise;
So Love increases by what satisfies.
After their eyes had their tongues place supplied
A while, that charming Organ they untied.
And sprightly Joy, the first of all must know,
Whether that place would not a Taedium grow?
For every man his native Country best
(Said she) esteems, though he should daily feast
In highest pleasures in another, yet
His native home, though homely cannot forget.
Can Paradise make you forget the Earth
A place so hugged by man, your place of birth?
The Pilgrim smiling to the quaerent then,
Sweetly, and nimbly thus returned ag'en.
Terrestrial things to those which heavenly are,
No^ Earth, to Paradise must we compare.
Such difference is betwixt Earth's joys, and them
As is betwixt Aeternity, and Time.
Were I in Egypt, or in Palestine
With all delights; it may be I as mine
Own native Albion (though there poor and mean
I still should dwell) should not so well like them.
But now I Am come upon this blessed shore
I can long after Albi^n, no more
Than those who in the highest Heavens be
Can wish, or long the lower Orb to see.
So far transcendent are these joys, that I
Account the whole World worthless vanity.
But your own Argument shall speak for me,
And prove that this place can no Taedium be.
Man loves his native Country best: And where
Is that I pray you, if it be not here?
He is a Pilgrim in the Orb below,
His Soul from higher Spears came down we know*
Therefore so restless is she there, to come
From her low prison, to her native home.
Then can I of this Country weary be,
The genuine place of my Nativity?
For Sin Man's banished, let him ^anish Sin,
And to his home he may return again,
No, think not Nymphs, that I can weary be,
Of Paradise, and your blessed Company.
But whilst this fair Corona stood, about,
(Discoursing sweetly with) our Pilgrim, out
Of a bright silver Cloud, an Angel ^^ept,
Whose flaming Wings the spiced Ether swept:
So Lightning breaks from the unparted Clouds:
So ^ol himself from's nightly Robes unshrouds:
But he did swifter then the Lightning run,
And showed more glories then the Earthly Sun.
His flaming Wings him swifter than a thought
From the imperial skies among them brought.
Unto him bowed the Graces all, and the
Guardian veiled both his Wings, and bowed, his knee.
The Pilgrim also would have bowed, but that
Excess of lustrous Glories struck him flat
Unto the Earth; for Mortal eyes could bear
Not half those Beauties he about him ware.
His Wings seemed flames of Fire, or burnished Gold;
His Garments which down from his shoulders rould
Unto his feet, composed of pure Light,
Thinner than air, than Ph^bus far more bright.
Unutterably bright the splendrous Sun
Was, that in's eyes and Lovely Visage shun:
Volumns of streaming Gold hung on his neck,
A Crown of tadiant Stars his front did deck:
Meadows of Violets, Woods of Roses know
No such perfumes, which in his breath did flow,
But above all such Heavenly Majesty,
And Power commanding sparkled in his eye,
That had a World of Mortals seen his face,
As dead they must have fallen in the place.
But this Throne-Angel for the Pilgrim's sake,
A Cloak of silver Clouds flung on his back,
To hide his radiant Beams, which yet did flow
Th'rough it, and made it like the Iris show:
Such pleasing Tinctures to that Cloak they gave,
That though less dazzling, yet it showed as brave.
Repressing to his face's radiant flood
He showed in beauty like to flesh, and blood:
But Nature yet with her diviner art,
In her best piece^, of his face came short.
The Angel then stretched out his snowy right
Hand (s^ow for softness and for perfect white)
To the Pilgrim, and lifting him up he brake
Silence, and thus in Heavenly Accents spoke.
The Immortal Prince of Glories, who of this
Fair Orb is King, and of the Thrones of Bliss,
At whose dispose ten thousand Crowns do lie
Of Glories, Bliss, and Immortality;
From whose free bounty we those Beams receive
Which such irradiant lustrous brightness give.
About whose Throne ten Millions such as I
Stand ready, on his Embassies to fly;
Has sent me to thee, mighty Saint! that so
Thou's Will, and pleasure from my mouth might know:
He has Commissionated me, that thou
Might taste his matchless Love, and Bounties now.
Therefore a Nuncius from the highest Sphere
I come, to thee this happy news to bear.
It is his Will, and pleasure now to prove
Himself indeed the matchless King of Love.
Thou precious art in his immortal Eyes,
And Heaven it self he counts too small a prize
For thee; therefore to bright SOPHIA he
Intends that thou in Heaven espoused shall be.
For this end therefore am I hither pressed
To celebrate this Heavenly marriage Feast.
Down fell the Pilgrim on his humble knees,
And bowing thrice his head re-echo'd these.
If Heavens servants so perstringe the sight
Of mortals, who can see the Fount of Light?
What Beauties does the King immortal wear!
When that his servants such high Luster bear!
If that one beaming of a Star's so bright,
What is the Sun the Ocean of Light?
But what am I! that Heavens immortal King
Should notice take on me, so vile a thing!
That from his Palace the b^ight Court of Day,
He should send down, a high (...)
Whom I 'm more fi^ to serve, such news to bear
That mortal Man could never better hear?
O I Am unworthy of the Dignity,
But yet I da^e not Heaven's high Gifts deny,
Since it is his pleasure that it should be so
To him I passive bow my Head full low;
Who can deny the blessed Gifts of Heaven
When Crowns, and Thrones, and bliss Aeternal's given?
O Lord thou know what is hest for me,
Since thou 'lt exalt me, I Will exalted be!
As thou my joys O Lord do higher frame,
So greater strength grant me to praise thy Name.
More would the Pilgrim there have said, but that
The Angel raised him up to Celebrate
Love's glorious Banquet; which blessed Banquet was
The Confarreation 'twixt him and his Spouse.
Under the Covert of Life's blessed Tree,
Upon the Leek-green grass this Company
Sat down; each blade its top does bow to them,
Each flower seeks to kiss their garments hemm.
There 'twas as if the flowers conspired had
To starr the place; or with their bravery clad
This little spot above the rest; for here
M^y's Iune's, and Augusts flowers together were.
An hundred teeming Springs seemed here their flowers
To have brought forth helped by the Midwife-showers.
Their bowing Heads which did in clusters (...),
Their gallant tufts to purple Cushions fit:
Heaven's Paranymphus first sat down, and the^
The Pilgrim, and his Loving Guardian:
The Paradysical Bevy in a Ring
Upon the inviting flowers themselves did fling
Making a circle, in whose midst was seen
A round spot covered with Smaragdine green,
Which Carpet garnished was with flowers, which (...)
Into true True Loves Knots conspired were:
A thousand Crystal drops of dew, the grass
Lading, did silver; Gemm, and P^^^l the place.
More pleasing Objects far our Pilgrim's sight
To feast, and Banquet to the full invite;
A Troop of Heavenly Dapifers they were,
Surcharged with Chargers who the Feast infer;
And with Caelestial art the Dishes placed,
The Pilgrim they with their attendance grace'd.
The Pilgrim's greedy eyes now on the meat
They brought, now on the bringers ravished eat,
Sometimes to that, sometimes to these he tossed
Them, and them in Beauties Meandres lost:
By's feeding eyes his Soul took her first taste
Of the rare Sweets of this delicious Feast,
Where the five Senses altogether dine,
And filled are at once with meat divine.
These were a Chore of Angels of that Sphere,
Who in their brightest Robes to day appear
To grace Love's Banquet; and themselves they clad
With all the glories the Aelisium had.
Yellow Electrum hung upon their hair,
Whose aubourn threads conspired int' Circles were,
Amongst whose gold-Rings silver spangles lay,
Whose Star-like twinkling made a kind of day,
And raised an Halos round about their Heads,
Which Cynthian lustres gave to those bright threads:
Whose golden Woods (whilst the Zephyrian shocks
Ruffle the Volumns of their Amber-locks)
Yield such a fragor, that all Arabie
With all her sweets cannot reach the tenth degree.
Chaplets of Roses, mixed with Lillies, fair
And purple Violets, bound their gold^n Hair:
Under whose blushing shades the Day did rise
From the bright beamings of their sparkling eyes.
But in their cheeks Roses, and Lillies be
Wedded together in just Harmony:
And 'cause the Lily reigned in their hands,
In their sweet Lips the Rose as Mistress stands.
Upon their Fronts dwelt the all-charming Graces,
An everlasting Hebe in their Faces:
Their youth, and beauty strove, but by their strife,
As friends, not foes they gave each other Life.
But the fair Robes with which they then were clad,
Of Paradises silver Clouds were made,
Garnished with diverse colors: less the bow
O^ fair Thaumant is to the World does show:
And far less Beauties does it give, than those
Which sweetly triumphed in their splendid clothes.
In these fair Mazes lost our Pilgrim was,
And to draw thence his eyes no power he has.
But whilst in Beauties Labyrinth his eyes
Do tread, melodious sounds his ears surprise,
Which prove a cliew to lead him from his gaze,
And out of that into another Maze;
His Soul but now did issue at his eye,
Out of both eyes, and ears she now does fly.
For the Angel having taken their Cue, by pairs
The Hymenaeum sung in sweetest airs:
The Waters, Groves, and birds do all agree,
Ecchoing their Melos to their Symphonie.
The sweet Symplones with the Angels join,
Marying their voices in a Tune divine
They sing this Hillulim: mortals below
Did never such sweet Harmonious Voices know.
The schreeking Spears were silent at that time,
And by their music learned a better Chime.
THE EPITHALAMIUM.
AFter sad Winter springs the Spring,
The Day thrusts, out the Night,
Storm past the pretty Birds do sing,
The Skies their musfling Mantles fling
Away, and cheer Earth with their sight.
After the floating Ship has past
A thousand dangers, she
Through the surging Waves, at last
Does Anchor in the Haven cast,
And there rests in Security.
So after an hard Pilgrimage
The Row Earth, and Hell, there is
Joys that the Travelers engage
For to forget their Earthly stage,
And evermore remain in Bliss.
This is the Day the Sun does rise,
The cheering Morn appears,
And Light springs from SOPHIA'S eyes,
Which blesses all our Paradise,
And joys unto this marriage bears,
This is the Time of Joys, and Praise,
True Laud therefore be given
To Him, who is the Light of Days,
Who to himself the Soul does raise,
And Earth despised, Wed to Heaven.
SOPHIA is the Queen of Love,
Her Joys Aeternal be:
Blessed Souls within her bosom move,
For ever taste the Bliss above,
Enjoying all Felicity.
This is the marriage of the Lamb,
The Lamb of Purity,
Who from the highest Heavens came,
Brought forth Aeternity in Time,
That Souls this Wedding day might see.
Fears are for ever wiped away,
Sighs from their Breasts are fled,
And happy evermore are they,
Who can attain this marriage Day,
And are unto SOPHIA Wed.
All happiness attends on thee,
No sorrows shall annoy
Sophia's Arms thy Comforts be,
Her Breast thy true Felicity,
And in her eyes rests all thy joy.
Blessed be this Day! thrice blessed is,
This hour, this marriage Feast,
For thou shall Live in Paradise,
In everlasting Joys and Bliss,
And be by thy Love ever blessed.
Praise to SOPHIA then we give,
And Hallalujah's sing:
By whom we in this Sphere do Live,
Who Souls from Earth to Heaven reprieve.
And deignes them to her home to bring.
Let Hallalujah's be our Song!
O may Sophia deigne!
With her all-quick'ning Breath among
Us, now to cast her odors strong,
And on us her spic'd shewers rain.
Hallalujah's to the blessed Name
For evermore we sing.
May it our warbling Tongues inflame^
O thou who did this marriage frame,
Accept these offerings that we bring.
Hallalujah, Hallalujah!
Hallalujah we cry,
Hallalujah, Hallalujah!
Our Tongues for ever warble may,
Thus unto all Aeternity!
Their Heavenly voices charmed the Pilgrim's ea^es,
With such like Songs, and animated airs:
But now they double their sweet melody,
And wrap him int' an higher ecstasy:
For every one takes his caelestial Lyre,
And runs divisions on the silver wire,
Gently their fingers chime the speaking Chords,
To which they marry Symphonizing words:
The Babe that sprung from this Conjunction,
Was Ravishment, and Admiration.
Earth's sweetest voices to their voices are,
Like the hoa^se squeeking of a new-made Car.
(...), and Orpheu's skill surpast was here,
So was the charming music of the Sphere;
Each whispering accent on its mounting wings,
To Paradise's highest summet brings
The Pilgrim'^ Soul; to Heaven's high Thrones she ran
Raised by the measures of their IASIAN.
Their Lydian strains his Heart exhilerate,
And with divinest Joys it animate.
But whether pleased him most their Tongues, o^ Lyres
He doubts; both charm him, and he both admires.
Their Tongues, and Fingers sweetly there do vie,
Epods the one, the other Melody
Bring to contend; but being sweetly joined
An happy Concord in their strife they find.
For whilst their Scarlet Tongues in quavering Notes
A sweet concent breath from their sounding Throats,
And trembling strings their nimble fingers shake,
And a Symphosiac Diapason make.
Both gently strike the circumambi^nt Air,
And sweetly kiss, and feast the Pilgrim's Ear:
Beauty his ^yes, his Ears their music feed,
And out of both, by both's Soul's ravished.
Whilst thus divinely learned measures they
Upon their Timb^els, and their Harps do play.
And whilst their prayse-tipt Tongues the ecchoing
Groves, with divinest accents make to ring;
Clouds of Perfumes, and sweetest Spices come
From their mouths hollow aromatic room:
These spice the air: musk ambergris and Mirrh,
In one breath sweetly mixed together were.
A gentle Z^pher mustered in a trice
Together, all the sweets of Paradise,
(For unto every Tree, and flower he flew
Kissing them sweetly, all their fragors drew
Into's inodorated mouth) and there
With sweet Ambrosiac Odors filled the fire.
Not all the Spices of Arabia,
Aloes, nor C^sha, nor st^ong Spi^kaard may,
With all the sweet Perfumes the Earth does bear
With these so redolent blessed sweets compare.
Nor Cloves, nor Cinnamon's sweet fragrancies,
Nor Liban's Cedars may compare to these.
Perfumes of Roses, Pinks, and Violets
Of sweetest Flowers, and of choysest sets.
Of Lilies, Oringes, and every thing
In Paradise, with every blast took wing,
And sweetly joined take without offense,
The Ivory portals of his smelling sense:
This fresh assault of Odors strongly pressed
To ravishment, the Pilgrim's smelling feast.
But now the costly dishes that were there
As'k him why they so long neglected were;
Their Beauties promised that they there should meet
More ravishments than he had tasted yet.
Upon them all his doubtful eyes he cast,
Musing on which he should begin to taste.
Each with a several beauty courts his sight,
And all to taste with equal force invite:
But whilst he mused, a Cup filled to the brim
The Angel took, and sipt, and gave it him:
'Twas sprightful NECTAR such as Saints above,
And all the angellic Chore to drink does Love.
Unto the brim the spark ing Liquor skips,
And blushing deeper than the Pilgrim's Lips,
Invites them to the Boul; they straitways join,
And down he takes that Boul of Heavenly Wine.
Nor Spain, nor Greece, nor hundred-City'd Creet
Could ever boast of Liquor half so sweet.
A golden Patin with Ambrosia,
His beauties next did to his eyes display:
On it he feed^: Madera sugars are
Sut both in taste, and hew if you compare
Them, to the Ambrosi^c meat: a thousand sweets
At every taste, his softer pallat meets.
The bread of Life stood in the second place,
Whiter than snow, upon a golden Vase.
Then Heavenly Manna in a silver plate,
With littering Beauties did invite to eat;
Like to the silver dewy drops in May,
Congealed a little in the plate it lay,
But so delicious was the taste of it,
That he was ravished at every bit.
This is the Angels food, their daily Bread,
By which for ever, they in Heaven are fed.
Milk, Honey, Oil divinely mixed were there
To nourish, Comfort, and the Spirits cheer:
'Twas Virgin's Milk, and Virgin Honey too,
Not fabl'd Iun^'s had so fair an hew,
Which pa^'d Galaxia: Nor Palestine
Ever flowed with Milk, and Honey so divine.
The Muses birds from every flower do bear
Gall, if their Mel you unto this compare:
Nor ever did the Haemetian Mountain hold
Such dulcified streams of liquid Gold.
Mincrva's Liquor bears a sooty foyl,
If once compared with this caelestial Oil.
Full Bouls of Heavenly Ne^^ar crown the board;
Cups full of Milk of the Ae^ernal Word
Scaturiant stand, whose purer White out-goes
The fairest Lillies, or the Alpine snows.
The Cups to smile with liquid silver seem;
Or Pearls dissolved; or Cl^opatra's gemm:
But they more rich, and costly Treasures hold,
(...) either liquid Silver, Pearl, or Gold.
(...) Sugar, nor the Honey founts of Creet,
(...), could a mess make half so sweet,
(...) that (...) Milk; for there
(...) sweets commixed were.
(...) crystal Phials, (...) with the
(...), and of Purity
(...); whose Crystal Liquor shon
(...) all the silver of the Moon.
(...) Water of Aet^rnal Life,
(...) Fire's most happy Wife)
Taken from that source, whose crystallized streams
Pearl Life's fair Trees, Roots with their matchless gemm.
The Springs of Bethlehem, which did David please,
No better were than Mirah's unto these:
The limpid Jordan though so clear he seem,
To these shows, as Asphaltes shows to him:
Sampson's strange Spring with which he quenched his thirst,
Nor Mose's stream which from the Rock did burst,
Could march these Ever-living Streams, one drop
Of these it was that made those Springs burst up:
One drop of these fair Waves it is gives unto
All Rivers, all the Crystal they indue.
Neighbors to these Cups of Obryziam Gold,
More precious than that of Ophir, hold
Dew, far more sweet than that which does distill,
From the sweet flowers upon HERMON Till.
From mystic SION'S sweetest flowers: this,
By Angels hands fresh daily gathered is;
And all the Graces which did grace the Feast,
These twice blessed Dews had by their Labor blessed:
For from fair Paradise's Trees, and flowers,
They had shook these (more than Argolic) showers:
From off the trembling Leaves, they shook the drops
Of purest Crystal into golden Cups,
Where a thousand crowded Pearls into one rold,
Showed like a fair one clasped in ductil Gold.
Deeply of these, the happy Pilgrim sips,
And drenches often his Nectarized Lips:
All mortal Waters this Azanium
Did loathsome, and di^tastful make to him;
And far more truly may this phrased be,
Than the Italians Chris^i Lachrimae.
His Tears, nor Blood were wanting there, for in
Most sumptuous Craters did that Liquor swim,
Whose taste, and color did by far excel
The sweet, and deep-dy'd Cretian Muscadel:
That sacred drink he also freely sips,
Which adds more Scarlet to his blushing Lips.
Besides all these upon the board did crowd,
Of Paradise's Fruit a multitude;
Whose sweetest looks, as well the eyes delight,
As their deliciousness the appetite.
No Salga^a's, nor yet Preserves express
Can half the tithe of their deliciousness;
Nothing of Earthly acritude was there,
Nothing of sharp, or bitter did appear,
(...) were delicious, and did sweetly vye
For to delight, with their variety.
All to excel the Pilgrim thought: His taste
Still gave the style of sweetest to the last,
Till he another tasted had; When it
With sweet delight made him the last forget:
So till he almost filled Was he guest
The last he tasted, still to be the best,
But then at last he could not but confess
His judgment lost in their deliciousness.
Would that the Earth had colors that could suit
For to express the beauty of the Fruit:
Scarce can that Bow, seen in the clouded air,
Its Opals with the shades of these compare,
Nor the three-squar'd Glasses varieties,
(Which does at once both please and hurt the eyes
With the reflection) can represent,
The shade of Paradise's Complement.
Man may by these some faint reflections frame,
But his Idea's cannot come near the same;
And those who have it seen do say they cannot,
Express the beauty of the meanest Plant.
Our slick, and scarlet Cherties nothing were,
Could they with blushes make themselves more fair;
Should they stand by the fruit of Paradise.
They would be robbed of all their braveries.
The Honey-^weet, and Purple grape would grow
Bitter, and lose her Purple garments too;
Our yellow Apples with their painted cheeks,
Would pale their yellow, and their golden streeks:
All Iune's, and August's gallant braveries,
One single Fruit our Pilgrim ^at ou^vies.
Sweet Thymiamu's and Arabian Spice,
^welt in the sacred Fruit of P^^adise*
So that at once those sacred Fruits did feast,
Three Senses, both the eye, the smell, the taste:
Between which three his Judgment was so tossed
That he was dubious, which was feasted most.
The sacred Graces which this feast did Crown,
Had there a Heavenly Banquet of their own,
Such food it was on which they daily fed;
And this before the Pilgrim too they spread.
'Twas fruit of Life's fair Tree, which they from thence
Had taken for their daily sustenance.
Their smiling Ioy's, and secred Peace's fruit,
With Hope's, and Faith's together sweetly suit:
There were the apples of blessed Chastity,
The daily Food of sweet Simplicity;
The Fruit of Love, and that which Innocence
Did daily feed on: That which Patience
Most Loved; and that so satisfying meat,
Which Meekness, and blessed Temperance did eat;
Brotherly Kindness, Single-mindednesse,
And many more which there his eyes did bless.
The Lovely Fruit with such sweet charms did greet
His fixed eyes, that he fell soon to eat
On every Dish; so pleasing was the Food,
The more he eat of it, the more he could:
Its sweetness could not cloy, and every bit
Gave satisfaction, and desire of it
Increased at once; in every bit there lay
Life-Honey, Manna, and Ambrosio.
But now four trines of blessed Angels bring
The second course of this sweet Banquet in;
Each one between his Snow-white Hands did hold
A Dish, whose metal purer was than Gold
Seav'n times tried over; the quintessence of that
Would be less pure and immaculate:
They were all framed of Gemms of Paradise,
Whose Sun-like Lustres did pers^tinge the eyes.
Not Epicurean Feasts, nor the profuse
Symposiums of wa^ton Syracuse,
Nor Sybaritic, nor all Asia's fare,
Might with what in those Dishes lay compare:
No, if all Lands, and Seas conspired were,
To feast a Monarch with their choysest cheer,
And should they bring the Hefperian golden Fruit,
Or rob Alcinou's Orchard 'twould not do 't:
Kings may command Earth's Dainties to their board,
But such as these, nor Earth, nor Seas afford.
Apples they were though not of ^assy Gold,
Yet far more rich, and fair for to behold;
Their full-blown Beauties did attract the eye,
Chearing the Spirits with their bravery,
For Gold, and Silver, and the blushing Queen
Of Flowers, lay involved of Beds of green:
The verdant Leaves espoused to the Fruits,
Gave them green Mantles to their Pinky Suits;
So all the dainties of sweet smiling May,
With Autumn's fair exuberances lay.
But whilst the Pilgrim's eyes content does take
In their fair looks: thus to him the Angel spoke
Immediately the Birds surcease their noise,
To hear the sweeter music of his Voice.
Now shall thou by experience confess,
The Way to Wisdom is the row foolishness,
At least by that which so the World does Call,
Who miscall all things ever since the fall.
Thou have by all a Fool accounted been,
Who superficiously thy paths have seen;
What greater foolishness can be to them,
Than all the World, and its Sweets to contemn?
Who leaves the World's High Ways though never so wise,
Still subject to Fools Category Lies:
But it O Pilgrim! granted is to thee,
That Heaven 's Archimagus thou shall be.
See thou those Lovesy Fruits, whose Rosy dye,
And hew, their Complements show to thy eye,
But when their inward virtues thou shall know,
Thou 'lt say one's worth exceeds all Earth's below.
These lovely Fruits which are before thee spread,
For thy sake from Life's Tree was gathered,
Jesus commanded that it so should be
For to express his mighty Love to thee.
And this excess of Love bespeaks, for why
But very few did ever feed so high.
But our great King now in these latter days,
Some to the highest pitch of Power will raise,
To match those Mortals who in Hell beneath
Feed on the Magic Fruit of the Tree of Death:
And as Hel's Powers increase so theirs shall rise,
Who feed on Life's blessed Fruit, in Paradise.
For once before Christ's great appearing Day
Shall be; both Kingdoms shall their might display
On the Terrestrial Orb: The Dragon shall
Sore to the skies to have the greater fall.
This is a special favor to thee shown,
For tho, that many to this place have flown,
And that the long Arm of Humility
Has reached them many Fruits of Life's fair Tree,
Yet these fair fruits they never tasted; they
Could only with their eyes feed on their gay.
Many may unto Paradise attain,
And other Fruit of Life's blessed Tree may gain,
And yet may not permitted be to taste
These blessed Fruits, which thou so freely may.
God's gifts they are, and his Arcana's be;
The very choice of all his Treasury.
All fitted are not for so deep a Feast,
Christ the sole Giver knows for whom it is best.
The Tree of Life has diverse sorts of Fruit,
Which with all tempers, and conditions suit;
All that may be for Man's own happiness
All that come here may eat; but these oppress
Peculiarly above the rest, the might,
Glory, and strength of the great Prince of Light.
The Tree of Life mounts up her towering Head,
Unto the Aeternal World, from hence does spread
Her laden Arms, and on her upper bough
These Theamagical twelve fruits do grow;
From thence these Angels brought them: what they are
And what their Virtues, I Will to thee declare.
O Man! Can Time contain Aeternity?
Or can it comprehend the Deity?
Can God grow old, or feeble? Time, or age
Immortal Srength, to languishment engage?
Is God's all-powerful Arm now weaker grown,
Than in those Ages which are past, and flown?
That thou thus boldly (O degenerate!)
That Miracles are ceased, do praedicate?
E're since the World did from a Chaos spring,
Upon its Theater, God still did bring
His acts of Wonder; spreading them abroad
As Witnesses to all there was a God:
All ages of the World can testify
Those matchless Wonders of the Dcity,
But why less frequent in these later times,
Is cause of Mortals unbelieving Crimes,
Faith now is wanting; whosoever has
That, may do Wonders: with a grain of Faith
Rocks may be moved: the Seas divided, and
Earth's floted over, the Ocean made dry Land.
Man's unbelief, and much unworthiness,
Has caused exuberant Miracles to cease,
But yet these later days so barren grown
Are not, but they true miracles have shown:
The Romish Church (although Priests oft^n fain
Some; through the cursed thirst of rotten gain)
True miracles has seen. O Man! despise
Not all; because some Priests have forged Lies:
For nothing is to thee more dangerous
Than to say, what God does Beelzebub does.
But to that pass men now adays are grown
That they no miracles at all will own,
But if ought pass beyond their apprehension,
They strait cry out it is black Hel's invention;
As if the Immortal King to Hell had given
The glorious Wonder-working Power of Heaven,
Or had resigned to him his right, or swore
Never to show his Arm of Wonders more.
Long shall not Man retain these thoughts, for why
As Lightning breaks th'rough the Crystal Sky,
So shall miraculous Wonders have a birth;
And with new Light illuminate the Earth;
And show that Heaven's Mag^tians can do
More than Beelzebub, or his Mag^ too.
For those who eat shall on these fruits you see,
Shall only God's true sacred Magi be;
And these shall make them so: thou shall be one,
Their several virtues therefore shall be shown.
See thou that Dish? Gifts of the Tree of Life.
those fruits in Scarlet died?
Who seem to brave it in Pomona's pride: Gift of Tongues.

Such is their virtue that they far excel
In giving Eloquence the Clarean Well.
Hermes himself less Eloquent shall be
Than those, whose Tongues these tip with swavity.
These tasted, strait the Tongue-ty'd sweetly speaks,
And all impediments assunder breaks:
Tongues stammering strings are scru'd to Heavenly strains,
The blattering Mouth the highest Measures gains:
They to the Eater straitwayes do dispense
The divine accents of true Eloquence.
Rhetoric Honey through their Lips do speed
And such are termed Golden-mouthed indeed.
Their virtue 's tied not to one Tongue alone,
It the true Grammar of all Tongues makes known,
And in a Moment the unlearned'st Man,
Can teach the deepest Characters to scan,
And make him speak all Languages that are,
More smoothly than his own vernacular.
To Mose's Mouth, the fluent A^^on, this
Fruit granted was, for the Isachians Bliss:
This sacred Fruits high Virtue, did imbue
A many of the holy Prophets too,
Whereby in charming Notes they did diffuse
God's sacred Word unto the stubborn Jews.
The holy Spirit when in cloven flame
He on the Heads of the Apostles came,
Touched their Tongues with this Fruits sacred juice,
And of all Tougues they straitwayes had the use:
Such is the virtue of this matchless Fruit,
Unless by those that are adjoining to 't.
But mark that next Dish, Of R^^son.
where green Leaves enclose
Fruit which in scarle^ Robes out-braves the Rose:
So fulgent Rubies court, and charm the eye,
When with clear Smuragds they invelop'd lie;
The Pestum flower peeps the row her infant Skreen,
With paler bl^^hes, wrapped with duller green.
The jayce of these impregnates strait the Brain,
Not with discourses Kicksie, nor with vain
Disputes: true Logic art it does diffuse,
And teaches Syllogisms how to use
For Heaven's own interest: True Dilemma's too
Can by infusion to the Taster show.
This does the understanding purge; the eye
Of The So^l, the Mind from Motes do purify:
This Reason does illuminate, and shows
How the true Dialectic Art to use:
Reason's corruptions, spots, and fallacies
This purges out: and gives it purer eyes.
This giv^th Arms unto Truth's Champions, and
Inables them in Dispute's Wars to stand.
This unto Paul was borne by some of us,
When He with Beasts battail'd at Ephesus:
By this at Athens, to the School he flew,
And the Epicures, and Stoics overthrew
With solid Arguments. This means did show
His persecutors how to overthrow:
The Jewish Rabbis, Gentile Doctors, Mute
At last were made: against him was no dispute.
That third Dish where in Seas of Beauties wallow
The slick-skin fruits; Of wisdom.
bestrip't with Red, and Yellow;
Screening their Virtues, in a double fold,
Of Crimson, Satin, and of yellow Gold:
The ground is Gold, upon whose face is spread
A thousand striplets of a grain-dy'd Red.
That Dish contains fruit of unvalued prize,
Whose sacred virtue makes man truly wise.
That Magic makes, and true Phi^^^hers,
That ^isdo^, and true Knowledge still infers.
Those Fruits unlock the fast-shut Cabinet
Of Nature, and her Treasures open set:
Nature's true ^ewels rol'd in pitch do lie,
Not to (...) by an Heavenly Eye
And such an one these give: an Eye that looks
Upon, and reads her most mysterious Books.
An Eye that through Neptune's Region goes,
And all things in his brinish Kingdom knows,
An Eye that walks through all the Mines,
An Eye that to Earth's solid Center shines:
An Eye which does perspicuously see,
What virtues, in all Vegitables be;
That the true Nature of all things that grow,
From the tall Cedar, to the shrub, does know:
An Eye that from the Earth to Heaven does rise,
And rangeth th'rough the myst'ries of the Skies:
That views the stations of the Wanderers,
That sees the mansion of the Northern Bears:
That knows the nature of those glittering Fires,
That reads their Lectures: and Heaven's Hand admires;
That knows their good, and evil influence,
They on the World, and Mortals do dispense;
That knows the causes of all natural things,
Seas, and Earth's motions, and the Winds swift wing^;
The streaming Metours, and the blazing Stars,
The hairy Comets sad predicts of Wars;
That truly sees, and knows all the parts
Of The Ptolomic, and Eucledean Arts.
These sacred Fruits besides all these disclose
Nature's hid Magic, which the unwise oppose,
The Ancients wisdom, whereby they could do
Things wonderful, yet natural, and true;
Not juggling tricks: nor by ill Spirits might,
But by Dame Nature's just, and sacred Light;
Almost extinct now in the World; unknown
'Cause men have sought praestigiae of their own,
And following airy Notions caught the shade,
Whilst the true substance did their hands evade.
Such are the Virtues of these Fruits divine,
Which with such matchless lustrous Beauties shines.
Of these the Father of the Faithful eat,
Sucking true Wisdom from the blessed meat,
And those who lived nine Ages to descry
The Planets dances i^ the azure Sky.
Great Solomon that mighty Magus had
His Wisdom and his Rnowledge from this food,
This sacred Fruit was lovely to his eyes,
For he this more than 's Crown, or Gold did prize.
He wisely said, For all things there a Time
Was; did but Mortals on the Earthly clime
Exactly know the same, they would not err
So often, and toys to precious Gemms prefer:
Of Wisdom it no Mean part is to know,
The means not only but the Time to do:
For what these blessed Fruits so freely give,
Men in all A ges after deeply dive,
Nor is 't unlawful for them to do so,
Did they true Time take, and right Ways to go;
Else all is vanity: For what is all this
If Man should know 't, and yet ignore his Bliss?
On this the King pitched his Mind's clear eye,
When he cried out, all things are vanity.
What are these Jewels, though they Jewels be,
If Man's not sure of Aeternity?
These are no means to gain the Heavenly Race,
These are but Crowns for those that gain the space.
They are unwise who first do seek those Arts,
Before that they have circumcised their Hearts:
For what they gain before is vanity,
What afterward our King does sanctify.
What men acquire, they usually abuse it,
What Heaven himself gives, he shows how to use it.
Let Man therefore the Time observe, and see
To gain Heaven first: these but additions be.
The World's eye who in twice twelve hours, Of Heal^ng.
and four,
The mighty Moles of the Earth views over.
In all her choysest Hort-yards cannot see
Fruits, half so fair, and precious as these be
Which in that neighbor Dish inchant the eye
With painted Robes, and fulvid bravery.
Those are Panchresta's for all ills of Man,
And who shall taste them shall Physician
Be to himself and others; these impart
Both Esculapius his, and Chiron's Art.
As the Heraclian Stone draws iron, and
To rubbed Steel imparts the same Command;
So these with perfect Health do Man imbue,
And to others make him Health's Physician too.
Simples from his Hand ^a'ne more virtues hold,
Than Bezoar or dissolved Pearl or Gold:
His touch, or Breath, or Word, or healing Eye,
May Physical Medicaments supply,
The Taster gains from these Fruits alone,
The healing virtue, and the med'cinal Stone.
Raphi^l this j^yce among the Fishes Gall did scruse,
Which Tobit to heal his Fathers sight did use.
Part of this Fruit was mixed with that Perfume,
Which did the evil Spirit overcome.
King Hezekia's Figs which healed his sore,
This Fruits blessed Liquor in their intrails bore.
By this Aelia's Life bestowed upon
The widow of Zarepta's stone-dead Son.
By this Elish^ did repress Life's flight,
And raised the Son, of the good Shu^amite:
Some of this juice he mingled with the Meal
Which did the Prop^ets poisoned Po^tage heal,
This in the crystal streams of Jordan lay,
When they washed Na'man's Leprosy away:
This mixed was with the Salt, which cured, the so
Unwholesome Springs of pleasant Ierico.
This to the h^mm of our King's garment drop^,
When by its touch the bloody issue stopped:
This in his healing Spittle hidden lay,
When that he an Opthalmic made of clay;
Which eyes restored to the born-blind; and
This in his Breath made whole the withered Hand.
Great Jesus our thrice blessed King did feed
On all these Fruits which are before thee sp^ead,
When he did flesh indue; But He that Food
Liked best, which most was for poor Mortals good,
Therefore he this used much; for through his Breath
Diffusing it; to Life he raised from Death:
He toth' Blind, Lame, Deaf, Dumb, Dead, power did give,
To see, to walk, to Hear, to speak, to Live.
To the (...) Pool once every year,
One of my Brothers of this Fruit did bear,
Whose virtue to those Waters virtue gave
The sad afflicted from their pains to save.
Legs to a Cripple through this vi^tue Paul
At (...) gave; Cured Eutichus his fall:
Healed himself; cured a possessed Maid:
Made Vipers hurtless: cured where is hand's were laid:
So the Disciples all; by this alone
Became Physicians unto every one.
That next Dish (pressed with its exuberance Of Prop^esie.

Of matchless Treasures, which their heaps advance
Above the low sides of the Pattin) seems
The chiefest Archive of Caelestial gemms.
How thrust it is, that it can scarcely hold
Those silver apples in its purest Gold.
Preachers upon this sacred food should feed,
This makes Divines, to be divine indeed:
This keeps the Eaters Mouth from speaking wrong,
Gives sacred Truth a dwelling in his Tongue;
So chimes that Member that she utters, what
^o pass in after ag^s shall be brought,
Makes Her so swift in Her predicting chime,
That she out-flyes the swiftest wings of Time;
By anti-Chronicles of things not done
Forestals the ages of the World to come:
Making his Linc^ous eyes to see so far
Things yet to come (like God) as if they were.
This to the Eater gives the golden Key
Which does unlock the Letter's mystery, (...)

Which does unseal the most mysterious Wells;
Which does reveal Gemms hid in Parables.
This does unfold the mysteries of the Night, O^ Dreams.

Visions appearing to the internal sight;
When the eyes double-guarded por^a's be
Fast locked up with Morpheu's Leaden Key:
When Night over half the World in silence reigns,
Then noted Dreams Court undisturbed Brains.
These Fruits give oil which oynt the Tongue, (...)
and make,
(...) fervent, daily speak
To Heaven: and render Essences so strong
That in stout ardo^s move the heated Tongue,
And with such fervo^r call on Heaven, that she
Even forces him with importunity:
Such flagitations don't with Heaven dissute,
When they rise from the virtue of this Fruit.
The Patriarch JACOB of this fruit did taste,
Before he gave unto his Sons, his last
Prophetic Blessings; wherein he relates
In Hieroglyphics all their future fates.
This fruit of Na^oh all the Prophe^s fed,
When Readiness fierce Nuncio's also prophesied:
And Saul, this (though unseen) when pressing through
His Lips, was also made a Prophet too.
This all those eat who to the Jews foretold
That Mortals should their God in flesh behold,
This gave them spiritual eyes to see, before
He came; that Jesus whom we all adore.
This Fruit was rolled, in Ezekiels Role,
This fruit was squeezed into Esdra's Bole,
This in the Leaves lay of John's Book, which He
Eat, with the promise He should Prophecy.
This Fruit Christ his Disciples granted too,
Whereby his words profunditly they knew.
Joseph, and Dan^el also of it eat,
When of Kings Dreams interpreters they sat.
El^sha eat of this when he by Prayer
Stopped up the watery Fountains of the air:
When he again by fervent prayer's power,
Cheered the dry Earth with a continual shower:
When he from Heaven with like fervent cries
Fetched Fire to consume the Sacrifice:
When he from Heaven Caelestial Flames twice drew,
The which two Captains, and their fifties slew.
Such is the virtue of that fruit you see,
A Gemm more rich than all Mortality.
But view the next Dish: Of Poetry.
Did a greater prize
(And less than Heaven it self) ever bless thine eyes?
Could Aretusa's tempting fruit more please
Spectator's eyes, with greater gay than these?
Do^ golden (...) rising from the main,
The gray-ey'd Morn with deeper Scarlet stain,
Th^^ the which blu^hes on their cheeks? or may
H^s ^^ams gild with a better Gold the Day?
What ^harmes upon their cheeks do lie! but see
Th^^^ ^qual measures raise the^r suavity;
How sweet a method in their make was seen!
See how their Gold, is chequered with green!
How passing sweet their outward beauties shine!
Nor are their inner beauties less divine.
Too long I cannot on these Eulogize;
Nor too much p^ayse their heavenly suavities.
He^v'n's Choristers when they begin their Songs
Of praise; with this Fruit's juice do oil their Tongue^:
The sacred S^riphs when they tune the Keys
Of their shril Tongues, for everlasting praise,
And Hallelu^ah's of this Fruit they eat*
Which does their prayse-^ip'd Tongues on fire set,
Whilst Sion's Harpers strike their trembling Chords,
Marying their Airs unto their quavering Words.
All of us Love this Fruit, for it inspires
Our Songs; inflames our Tongues with Heavenly Fires;
Th^s Fruit it is which makes a P^et shine
And makes his Numbers, and himself divine:
This Fire inkindles in his noble breast,
Which makes him Loves lascivious lays detest:
Sup^-caelestial are his harbored Fires,
His lays are tuned to the Angels Lyres:
(...) divine, and spiritual Songs do bear
(...) Soul unto the highest Sphere;
(...) P^^^mes, and rapting Hymn's high Keys,
F^o^ g^aver Epods up do often raise
His So^l; then with (...) fury, He
Makes Dis to tremble at his melo^y.
In this ^^uit's juice his lip^ he drenches, this
His (...), and Hippocren^ i^,
One (...) of this sweet juice can make him do,
More than (...) Mu^es, and Apo^^o too.
The King^^ H^^per eat this blessed Food,
When (...) Spirit he so sweetly chewed;
By this inspired he wrote those Heavenly Lays,
Those Hymns of Joys, and those Psalms of praise.
This made the ma^ty^'d Fathers often sing.
When scorching Flames their burning arms did fling
About their naked flesh; whilst fur^ous kisses
Sent their rejoicing Souls to lasting Blisses.
That neighbor Patt^n which transparent seems, O^ discer^ing of spiri^s.

Does also hold inestimable Gemms;
They apples are, although unto our sight,
Each one appears a big-swell'd Ma^garite;
The Persic gulf, not yet the Eastern Seas,
Did ever Unions yield so fair as these:
Not all the Children of the Cheripo's
Could half the value match of one of those
Fair radiant Globes: whose lustrous beamings forth.
Sufficiently do testify their worth.
These to the Eater give a Beam of Light,
A more than Lynx's ^ye, a piercing sight,
Which through the feigned Cloaks of Spirits can
See their true shapes, although they false put on.
Though Hel's ^rince should his swarthy hide paint over
With Virgin Beauties; though such wings he wore
As I have on: Should he Angellic clothes
Put on, his visage paint with purest snows;
His Snakes to Amber Curles convert; his brow
His Horns pulled in with pollish'd Ivory strew:
His jagged Teeth in order set, and from
His horrid Mouth breath nothing but Perfume,
His knotty tail tie round about his wast,
And over that ten snowy Mantles cast;
Pare all his claws: hide his deformity,
And uglines^e, with borrowed brave^y:
And strive his utmost, egged by cunning h^te,
Our speech, as well as clothes to imitate;
Yet will this Fruit discover his deceit,
Lay open the Monster, and make known his cheat.
The Eyes it gives cannot deceived be,
They the row false paintings and adornme^^s see,
Discern Impostors who usurp our room,
Des^ry Wol^^^ which in borrowed Sheepskins com^:
See Sathan's blackness th'rough his painted skin;
See the row his Angels shape a Devil within.
Those eyes it gives, are acuous, and divine,
And know false borrowed shapes, from genuine.
O how should Mortals for this fruit entreat!
Which frees them from the S^ygi^n monsters cheat,
Which shows his fuco's, and his subtilties,
Heretic Errors, and prestigious Lies,
Which though he comes in an Angels dress,
Betrays him to his genuine ugliness:
For want of this, good souls have been misled,
And into ills l^y false shapes ravished;
Those snares do most entangle which he uses,
When Mo^tals he under our shapes abuses.
By this blessed Paul the imposture's shape espied,
Although of Christ, and him he test^fy'd,
And having seen him he to Hell betrayed
Him, Acts 16.
and delivered the Divining Maid.
By this the Infant Church had eyes to s^e,
Jesus from Idols, Truth from Heresy;
The cunning tricks, and wondrous subtilties,
Satan still used to blind the Heathens eyes.
This then discovered his impostrous che^ts,
Made known fair Truth, and his most foul deceits.
The next though palenesse in their che^ks appear, Of union and Communion with
holy spirits depa^ted.

Less Lovely, nor of lesser virtues are:
How sweetly kissing in the Di^h they lie!
These are the Apples of true unity:
This precious Fruit bears Adamantine glue
Can chain a thousand Hearts as well as two.
With tru^-Love Links fast in a Knot together:
That Hell, nor all his Ramms shall break the tether.
'Twixt Spirits this frames a true unity,
And binds with bands of best Community;
An hundred Hearts it can so fastly bind,
That they shall seem but all one Heart, and mind.
This can do more: for the dread stroke of Fate
By this Friends hears linked cannot separate.
It ties immortal gives, though Death can slay
The Carcass, yet cannot take these ties away,
For spite of Death (their Souls together still
Being joined) they visit one another will.
By this the Saints a sweet Communion have,
With those who long since past the silent Grave.
For Death, to a Communion spiritual,
To such is no impediment at all.
Those out of Bodies with perspicuous eyes
Can see Hel's plots, and cruel subtilties;
And to their Friends they often permitted are,
Those precipies timely to declare.
By this the Patriarchs, the Apostles, the
Blessed Saints, and all the Martyred Fathers, be
Alive to this Day, and by this alone,
Man may with them still have Communion:
Thus Friends divided by the Hand of Fate,
By this alone are made inseperate,
For this gives ties that cannot broken be,
By the weak Hand of frail Mortality.
All the Apostles of this Fruit did taste,
Which linked their Hearts so fast.
By this Communion with each other, they
Kept, though they over the Earthly World did stray
Apart; and those who did survive the rest,
Communion kept with those whose Deaths were blessed
By martyrdom; which Courage stout did give
To know the Bliss in which their souls did live.
Thus blessed Dyonsius Arcopagita, i^ Ep^st. ad Tim.
Denis, joined in unity,
After their Deaths did Paul, and Peter see,
Crowned with glorious Crowns of sacred Light,
Arrayed with Ro^es of more than snowy white.
By this Fruit thus they after Death, with one
Another held a strict Communion.
That golden Pattin which stands next to this, Of Union and Commun^o^ with holy
A^g^^s.

Of Fruits with brightness clothed the Arca is:
Heave'n's brightest Tapers in the Skies do blaze
With lesser Luster; and less sparkling Rays,
Than these: whose beamings and illustrous shine,
Preach their own^ Beauties, and their Worth divine.
We much desire that man should seed on this
Illustrous Fruit; for by this Fruit he is
Acquainted with us: by this Fruit alone,
We have with Him, and He has union
With us: by this our several Hierarchies
Our Beauty* splendour, and Attires he sees.
To Man by this illustrous Fruit alone
Our Care; and kind Philanthropie is known.
Here (could our Heavenly Joys permit us grieve)
I could Threnoda's sing, 'cause Men deceive
Themselves; to think its any's Fault but their
Own, that we do not now so often appear
As we have done in former Ages; No
The fault's not Ours but theirs we do not so.
The Reason why so often we do not press
From Heaven to Earth is Man's unworthiness.
What else can Mortals think that it should be?
Cannot we be clothed with visibility
With as much ease, This is the opinion of some: of others: See P. 49. 50.
as then, think they? or now
Grown old with Time, do also lasie grow?
Think they the space 'twixt Earth, and Heaven more
Large, and wide drawn than in times before?
Or do they think our Love diminished?
Or that they of our helps now have no need?
Or do they on our Maker lay the blame?
That he to former Ages than to them
More Love did show? think they him partial, that
We did on those, and not on them do wait?
Or do they think our King has more to do
In Heaven for us, that he cannot spare us now?
What is it that peevish Mo^tals think? what e're
They think, it is their sins that keep us here,
Sealed from their eyes; which hide this blessed Fruit,
So that they know not which way to come to 't:
For could they eat of it, Here is (...) and sig^^*
they often would
With ^leasure us familiarly behold.
In Ages past when we so frequent were
With Men, and did in Humane shapes appear;
Simplicity, and Innocence reign
Did amon^ M^n, they knew not how to gain
By lying Miracles: their Natures all-
Most like to ouers were Angelical:
But after Satan broached his vanities
Which men sucked in; he under our disguise
Of them deceived; so his delicious food
They fed upon supposing it was good:
So as their sins increased we disappeared;
Whilst Satan of his Conquests Trophies reared,
Which he by feigning Angels shapes did gain:
Whereby we did to Man obscure remain.
This now continues, so man thought at last,
Our dispensat'on of Appearing past:
And now he boldly if we do appear
As we were wont, averrs we Devils are.
But blinded he is ignorant that this
Fruit, God's most sacred Fruit, and blessing is,
Which still is free as ever it was for Man,
Were he but worthy to obtain the same.
Of this fruit 'twas those holy Men did taste,
With whom we had, in all the ages past
Communion: for who do eat of it
We are for them, and they for us made fit:
We then to such shall not as strangers be,
But much frequent each others company.
That Royal Fruit which in that Dish does lie,
Whose very looks with Wonders, Gifts of Miracles,
maze the eye,
In beauty, and in virtue shall give way
To none, which fed thy blessed eyes to day,
See but what charms are spread upon their cheek,
Their hew, and make, their wondrous virtue speaks.
This fruit indeed a faithless Faith expels,
And gives one of working Miracles.
The Eater shall nothing too hard suppose
To be effected by him: for by those
Mountains may be removed, Seas made a Plain,
And all the Champain floated with the Main.
All living Creatures, and inanimate
Obey his Word, who of this Fruit have eat:
He miracles shall truly do, although
Beelzebub's servants will not own them so,
Or if they do, with belching Mouths outright
They cry, they are done by their own Master's might;
When by this Fruit they are down, which you behold,
As also were true miracles of old.
By this great Moses Power had to divide
The blushing Seas: by this was Jordan dried
Twice by Elisha's Mantle: The Command
Of Joshua still enforced the Sun to stand.
By this Fruit also great Amozides
Repel'd the Days great Giant ten degrees.
Of this Fruit also blessed Jesus eat,
When he so many Wonders did Complete,
That many Volumns cannot comprehend
The tithe of them: his Wonders have no end.
By this the blessed Apostles did effect
Their Miracles: Wonders with Wonders backed.
Great Thaumaturgus when the Word he spoke,
By this Fruits Virtue dried up a Lake.
By this the latter ^ges not a few
Have Wonders done; Eusebius. Eccles. Hist. lib. 7. c. 25.
and Wonders more shall do:
For time draws nigh wherein this Fruit shall then,
Not such a stranger be to Mortal Men.
The next Dish holds five glorious Apples, that
Man's five internal Senses animate, Gifts of seeing.

The first whose beauties are so excellent
That plunge Spectators into ravishment,
Unlocks the crystal pyla's of the eye,
Permitting it Heaven's Beauties to descry.
By that the inner eye has often a sight
In sacred Visions of Aeternal Light
Of this blessed place, and of the Throne of bliss,
Where our great King's immortal Splendour is.
By that we may be seen; by that the eyes
Behold the inner-VVorld's varieties:
And all the Spirits that created be,
In all the World's perspicuously see:
By this Elisha's servant's eyes unbarr'd
Were, when he saw his Master's fiery guard:
John's, Iame's, and Peter's when the on Tabor saw
Elias, Christ; the Giver of the Law.
The second that in yellow Ornaments,
Does ravish with a thousand blandishments, Of Hearing

Continually a golden Key does bear
Which opes the Portals of the inner ear.
Through which the Sounds of Paradise do go,
And the caelestial Harpers music flow:
The Row which the inner World's sweet Harmony,
And all the Angels mystic voices fly.
By this young Samuel's tender ears were bored:
When he the voice heard of our Sovereign Lord.
And divine Ioha's, when he did hear the voice,
Like to the rushing of enraged Seas.
The third which does the Indian Nard excel,
Or all the spice of Arabie in smell, Of smeling.

The inner smelling Sence's gates does wide
Set open; the row which Caelestial Odors slide;
The Row which the sweet Perfume of Paradise,
To cheer the Brain and Spirits sweetly flies.
The fourth whose sweetness Honey far exceeds,
With dews of Paradise the Eater feeds;
By that the Manna of Jerusalem, Of tasting.

To taste is often granted unto him,
By that his tongue on food divine does taste,
And's inner Palate on Heaven's sweets does feast.
The last whose slicknesse far exceeds the silk, Of touching.

Whose snowy whiteness far the purest milk,
Gives to the Eater sensibility
Of the Contactions of Divinity.
By it he feels those pleasant thrillings, which
His Soul with the extremest Joys enrich;
Those burning tinctures of the deepest Love
Which round his Heart with matchless pleasures move.
Of these three last the holy Saints did feed,
Be'ing granted to them in the time of need,
When persecution's mouth with all its power,
Sought them with cruel torments to devour,
Those then were Cordials to support the Hearts,
Against persecution's cruel Flames, and Darts,
The lowest Dish which does conclude the Feast,
Though it comes last, Gifts of divine Magic.
yet is it not the least;
The Fruit it holds is of such price, and Worth,
That it will lose much by my setting forth:
Not all the Rhetoric an Angel has,
Sufficient is, this precious Fruit to praise.
This is the Fruit that makes Mortal Man
To be Iehovah's great Magitian,
Art- Magic this does to the Eater show,
And him with Heavenly Sapience imbue:
Those Arts it gives are Sacred; and by this
A true Philosopher the Eater is.
In former Days this Fruit has frequent been
With Mortals, though it now is scarcely seen
Upon the Earth; for faithless they do call
All Geocy, that is supernatural:
As if that God in Earth resigned his Right
Had unto Hell, or that his glorious Might
Were to be tied, unto the poor dimention
Of shallow Man's more shallow comprehension.
This Art indeed to Man is scarcely known,
For at his back he has the Substance thrown
For to embrace mere shadows, or what is worse
Arts which upon their Students pull a Curse.
What Is all the Knowledge that the World affords,
But empty shadows, vain, and windy Words?
This Art deserves the Name of Art alone,
Although to Man it be so little known;
In which are Depths, unfathomable, Seas
Where greatest Wits may swim, and if they please,
In which is something more than Notions; and
Things that with the sublimest Wits may stand.
Great Miracles this Magic-Art affords,
Not caused by joining superstitious words,
But in the true Name of Jehovah all
Wonders are done, if truly magical.
But what is the Reason that this Art is lost, The abuse of Magic, and how the
divine Magic comes to be lost.

And with it all true Sapience almost
Now in this latter, but yet wicked Times?
It Is Man who has obscured it with his crimes;
And subtle Satan by his cunning: who
The Name of wisdom makes a Bugbear too.
Since Simon spoiled the Name of Magus, all
Hell's Necromancers they Magitians call:
A Name of Glory once, though now the same
Is by the World used as a Brand of shame.
What makes the World suppose, that there can be
No VVonder done but by Necromancy?
No action that is metaphysical
But men suppose it Diabollical?
What makes them that they do themselves deceive?
And that there is Magic that is divine believe
Will not? it is cause the worldly Wise have sought
To find it out and have effected naught.
How many are there who have sought to find
This sacred Fruit! yet they have proved blind,
And by the Devils subtle tricks have been
Turned from the Path, when they were rightly in.
Some they two dozen years have sat, or more,
(And were as wise then as they were before)
Reading (so long until they could not see)
The moldy Volumns of Antiquity:
Toying amongst that antiquated ware
To find the Stone of the Philosopher.
But such because they sought, and sought in vain,
With Lies maliciously the Truth arraign;
And 'cause they missed have their Aim, thy cry
There Is no such thing: a mere deceit; A ly.
Such great Ablep^ie does in others brain
Lie, that they cannot see, though it be plain,
Before their eyes: and though it couched be
In mystic, and yet plain Philosophy.
True Books they have, but yet their blinking mind,
Among those Truths cannot the true way find,
No Philosophic VVritings, but they pore
Upon them, read, and turn them over, and over:
Plato they over and over so often turn
'Till with their Thummings he is in pieces worn.
And so they also with their fumbling fists,
Mouze all to pieces twenty Tresmegists.
Then Plotinus so often is turned over,
And sullied, that they can read no more.
At last, their Patience being worn threadbare,
With Aristotle they contented are;
And on his Metaphysics grovelling lie
Or soar no higher than the starry Sky:
Having in him once mounted a degree
Philosophers in fashion then they be:
Then these are wise men: why? because they know
The natural causes of some things below.
Not thus content they wrangling Sophists turn,
And at true wise men, and true Wisdom spurn.
But others with an Apetite canine
Fall to the Egyptian mystery divine
Couched in their Hieroglyphics: but such bones
They find to pick; that wearied; for the nonce
They cry, these painted pictures of deceit
Were only made Philosophers to cheat;
That under them no mysteries do lie,
Of Learning, nor yet of Divinity:
Thus vainest Fools do still calumniate,
Those sacred Relics which they cannot come at;
Barking against them, in an angry tune,
Like churlish Currs that bait the fair-fac'd Morn.
Another sort (as wise as all the rest)
Their wits with the Arabian wise men feast,
And all the modern Wise men, where with pains
And diligence, they strive to crack their Brains.
Geber so often marked with their nails is spil'd,
And Lully with black interlines is filled.
Arnold, and Riply with an hundred more,
Are with notes in the margent scribled over.
From these now having gained a Theory,
They practice for the stone in Alchimie;
And having vapour'd all their Coin in smoke
Their good Opinion of the Stone revoke,
Of whom some cry to others that they should
No longer be with vain Opinions fooled.
For by experience woefully they find
There Is no such Stone: And why? because they are blind.
But others of them (who more spiteful are)
Because that they themselves deceived were,
Turn base Impostures, and the simple cheat
By many a juggling, and prestigious feat.
Thus by imposture full of filthy shame,
They bring on Chymic Arts an odious Name.
Others of them do full as bad, or worse,
Cheating men's Wits as these do cheat their Purse,
For these desiring for to get a Name,
(No matter how, so they can purchase Fame)
Would fain be thought for to have gained the Stone
Which they forsooth will give to every one
Out of their charity, but lest profane
Men, and unworthy should this purchase gain,
They must write in an aenigmatic style,
Where they with simple sopperies beguile
Their studious Readers; and in mystic guise
Without control invent a thousand Lies.
Then imitating some Philosophers,
Who might have Truths divine couched under theirs,
They talk of Dragons, black, and green, and Red,
Of mystic Virgins being brought to Bed,
Of maidens Milk of Caput Mortuums,
Of black turned white; then when the blessing comes
Their admonitions unto secrecy,
Wish such like stuff and simple soppery:
Where Men may sooner find a Mine of Gold
Than in such Books a line of sense behold,
Which being seen the World cries on them shame,
And 'cause of them all mystic Writings blame:
Thus by impostures tricks, and Knaveries,
The Truth's entangled with obscurities.
But others thinking these choice Fruits to gain,
With tedious lucubrations, and pain
Have courted Princely Plolomie to show
Them, in what place among the Stars they grow.
Then into Haly greedily they pry,
And search the shining Records of the Sky,
Visit the Poles; and all the Planets, and
Those Volumns penned by the Almightie's Hand;
But missing there the thing they sought for, they
Out of vexation fling their Books away;
Or else turn Prophets, and prognosticate,
Of Winds, Rains, snows, Subjects, and Rul^rs fate:
Who broaching ignorantly gross mistakes
Make the Art evil spok'n of for their sakes.
Others there are which for this Fruit do seek
In the Meanders of Arithmetic,
Into those deep Arcana's down they dive
In Number's grave burying themselves alive,
Those speak by Figures, and by nodds least they,
Breaking their silence should themselves betray:
What mystic Monad, perfect Quadrats, Trines,
What double Numbers, and unlucky Signs
Of odd conjoined Figures, and the like
They have! which in 't amaze the unlearned strike:
But some whose patience worn out with their Book,
Into Pythag'r as can no longer look;
(Whose suppositious pamphlets in his Name
Which bring to that Philosopher great shame)
Cry out all is Deceit that Numbers be,
And all the Art but mystic Knavery.
And thus the World by witness testifies
Against the Truth hid in all mysteries.
Others notorious in their Notarie
Art, juggle with as simple Foppery,
Thinking this noble Magic may be took,
From the Loins of some suppositious Book
Of Apollonius, or of Solomon
Which these blind Dotards, dote too much upon.
These superstitious make a wondrous do
With mystic Names of God, and words, not true,
Merely invented with full sounds to awe
The Ignorant, with superstition's Law.
But when they see themselves beguiled by
This pious-fac'd-deceitful Theurgy,
They to the World with open mouth proclaim,
Their own Ablepsie, ignorance, and shame;
Whereby the sacred Hebrew mysteries
In Names too deep for them the blind despise.
Another sort of Men there is, who do
Long earnestly to be Magitians too,
Tritemiu's and Agrippa's Books they get,
By which each Note, and Character they set
In their due place; their Crosses, Lamens, and
Their Pentacles must all in order stand,
Their Tapors, Swords, and consecrated Oil,
With other stuff (the easier to beguile
Themselves) they fit; assaulting by and by
The Camp of Devils with their Geocy.
How easily to them does the Devil yield,
And let them for his gain to win the Field,
Being commanded for a while, that he,
At last a Tyrant over their Souls might be!
But some repenting timely did impart
Hel's cunning, and the Follies of that Art,
By which the World so fearful grew, and fell
To think all natural Magic came from Hell,
So Paracelsus, nor Agrippa, nor
More skilled in natural Magic could prefer
Its Wonders to the World, but for their pains
They branded were for Hel's Magitians.
But others whom Hel's wretched Prince can gain,
With a black union their dear Souls to stain,
Dive to the botton of Hel's Arts, and there
Indeed great dark- Magitians appear:
These Necromancers freely he indues
With Wonder-working Power, his Kingdom shows
To them: and triumphs greatly that he can,
Make known his Power by the arm of Man.
These can do Wonders, and the World amaze:
Such might on Man, mighty Beelzebub ^ays:
Such was great Iannes, such was Mambres, or
Black Elymas, the wicked Sorcerer:
And such was Simon, who often backed a Cloud
And the row the Air rode in his Chariot proud.
These Men the World with such great fear infected,
That mysteries divine became suspected,
Science was lost, and Ceremonies all,
Accounted were, or Diabollical,
Or superstitious, and the very Name
Of Magic tainted, odious became.
Thus divine Magic was obscured; and
Men will not believe, that Heaven's all-mighty Hand
Can by his proper instrument disclose
His mighty Power, Hel's Magi to oppose,
And that great Man, by Heaven enabled, show
Can, as great Wonders as all Hell can do.
But if such should appear the World would strait
Them, Hel's black Necromancers nominate,
Call us black Devils, or base Incubies
If they but hear that Man our Faces sees:
Thus you may see how Men themselves do cheat,
With Fear, and the opinion of Deceit.
Thus Truth, and the true magic that is divine,
Wrapped over with pitch, alone does inly shine:
And is a Jewel locked up from the World
That so much Dirt, and mire at it has hurled.
But don't you wonder what the reason is
That all (or most) men of their aim do miss?
And that this sacred Magic still in spite
Of all their searchings, Why so many have lost their labor in the search of
the Stone.
is obscured in Night?
Labor all things o're-comes you think, and they
Investigated it have Night, and Day;
With toil, and sweat, pains indifagitable
And all the forces that their wits were able
To muster, for This searched have, and yet
The knowledge of this Magic cannot get.
The Fault's their own; for they wrong ways have took
And the true Road to Bliss, and it forsook.
Their selfish wit, and wisdom this have wrought,
And from fair Truth's to errors paths have brought
Them; 'Cause they saw the way that to it led
Simple, and plain, therefore the same they fled:
They this forgot: TRUTH does all coverings flee:
That to be Wise, is first a Fool to be.
Money, no^ Wit may be the purchasers
Of it; Obedience chiefly this infers.
This Magic's sacred, holy, and Divine,
By God himself hid from the World's dull eyne:
Does Man then think that all his witless wit,
And prying's able to discover it?
Unless God with his Finger shew't himself,
In vain they wast their wits, their Time, their Pelf.
This then is one cause why so many fail,
Because they do to their own wits intail
The knowledge of it: for they never doubt
But by their Wisdom for to find it out.
But this Pearl God has hidden from the eyes
(In ten-fold pitch) of all such VVorldly-wise,
And sooner may they crack their troubled Brain,
Than one poor glimpse of this deep mystery gain:
God does it to a seav'n-sold Chest commit,
And Prayer is one holy Key of it.
Another Reason why this Pearl they miss
Because they slight the sacred Scriptures, is;
Trusting more to the Heathens Scriptures, than
Those which contain all happiness for Man,
As if (because their vain Philosophy
They cannot in that blessed Writ descry)
The true Philosophy that is divine,
Therein with sacred Luster did not shine:
But those will find, who pierce the mystery
A Philosophic, high divinity.
The way to Bliss, and to this Magic, there
Unsealed to eyes enlightn'd will appear.
Man's Heart's deceitful, full of subtle wiles,
Both others, and himself he often beguiles,
His Heart's corrupt, for though he seeks for Bliss
A foul Colluvies at the bottom is:
God this beholds, and whatsoever he seems
To man, he sees his close intents and Aims.
Many investigate this Pearl: But why?
Some some selfish aims close in their Hearts do lie;
But such must know, all self must laid aside
Be, or they else shall ever be denied.
FAME, and Renown infuse some short-lived hear,
Which causes some upon this Work to set;
Poor blast of Air which shuffles Man to Pride!
That Man expect should to be satisfied!
That God should yield to him, and not deny
His Lust, and Humors vain to satisfy!
He who has aims besides God's glory, shall
If clime unto this Art, but gain a Fall.
How many (...) the P^ilo^ophers Stone
(Part of this A^t, and but the meanest One)
Out of mere Avarice, and hope of gain;
Hoping it will be their God Aeschylane.
These are the Spurs, wherewith themselves they rouse
When they th'rough Pains their dulled Spirits lo^se,
But such at last, when their Spurs dulled are,
Tire, and yield up themselves unto despair;
Who have no better Spurs than these, the mire
They must go the row their lazy jades shall tire:
But the true seekers of the noble Stone,
Have golden Spurs to spurious such unknown.
These be the Reasons why so many miss
The STON^; and their investigated Bliss.
To thee dear Pilgrim need I not to show
The way to Magic; The way to gain the divine M^g^c.
it is the Way which you
Have come, and there is no other Path which guides
To this Caelestial Art of Arts besides.
It Is not the selfish Wise man this can gain,
It Is not the Covetous shall this attain,
It Is not the thirsty after Glory, shall
Be able once to touch this Magical
And happy Fruit; from such it is safely kept
By an huge Dragon, whose eyes never slept;
Those who this Fruit will gain must first outright
O're-come this Dragon in a single Fight.
O man thou must Regenerated be
Before thine eyes this happy Fruit can see,
For none but Children gain this Diadem;
Children of Love: it is preserved for them;
Ch^ldren of Innocence; who washed are
In bl^st Regeneration's Lavar fair.
This happy Fruit by the free Hand of Heaven,
To such Regenerated Babes is given:
By which from Babes to an exalted pitch
They '^ raised, and so become Men wise, and Rich;
Rich in those Treasures, whose most simple Gemm,
The World does, and its richest Riches shame.
Th^s gift is Free, and yet it must be sought,
Yet by true Resignation it is bought.
God gives a portion small at first, but so
As it Man uses, shall his Talent grow.
But never let Man hope for this estate
'Til 's heart is pure, and Regenerate;
You know great Riches, and high Honors are
The Devil's strongest, unresisted snare,
By which oft-times he Souls does overthrow,
Who pious were, ever they those B^^ts did know:
Think you that God th^n int' Man's hands will put
So sharp a Weapon his own Throat to Cut?
Think you he will to him the Stone disclose,
'Til how to use it for his good he knows?
Nor knows Man how to use it 'till that he,
(First truly Dead) Regenerated be:
Then let all, who this Art investigate;
In Soul and Body be regenerate:
Then if they ask, they shall receive the prize:
If Knock the sealed Door assunder flies:
If seek, they find: if pray, they are heard: Thus I
Have showed the true way to Felicity,
The way whereby this Fruit may be attained:
Whereby the much desired STONE is gained.
He then who pure is, What a divine M^gitian is.
and Regenerate
And blessed so, that he may freely eat
Of this beatifying Fruit, he then
Becomes Heaven's SOPHUS, or Magitian.
O those blessed Bonds which fast together tie,
God, and the Soul, Man and the Deity!
Nothing 's impossible for him to do,
Who this blessed state, and pitch attained has to,
For if to him, to God it must be so;
His Will is God's, they are no longer two:
He wills nothing but by Heaven's own Will:
Then what shall dare not his Command fulfill?
He now is Sovereign over the World, and all
Things, that therein are shall obey his Call.
For by this Art of divine Magic, he
May shroud him in invisibility:
Walk on the Clouds: stand in a flame of Fire;
And the row the walls, if doors be shut retire:
May walk upon the s^^liest Seas, while they
Smoothing their rugged Fronts his feet obey.
To him diseases bow their eager heads,
And at his touch they leave their nasty beds
And fly to Hell, from whence they came; for by
His touch, and Word restored is Purity.
Of Vegitables the true use he knows;
The poison in each herb away he throws,
And perfect Chemist by Spagyric Art,
Hell from Heaven's Essence, Dross from Gold can part.
Both A^^mals, and Minerals also,
He not by guess, but perfectly does know:
As Man may in a Mirror see his Face,
So he their virtues through their outward Case.
No thing's unknown to him, all Arts that be,
Unmasked are, and he views their Verity.
Metals he may transmu^e: the Stone by which
They are exalted to the^r highest pitch
Of persectnesse he has: which will unfold
The way to change all Metals into Gold.
Not only Bodies are at his Command
But all created Spirits also stand
To do his Will: The sneeking Devils are
If he Commands enforced to appear
With louting Heads, and trailing Tails, and eyes
Dejected, to behold themselves made prize:
To see that Man, whom they triumphed upon,
Now to have Rule and be a Lord over them.
O they had rather to the darkest place
Of Hell run, than behold their own disgrace,
For if he comes where they be, they run
Into the lowest darkness headlong down;
For they his eyes as much now hate to see,
As the bright splendour of Aeternity;
For they behold him with that glory clad,
As once themselves before they lapsed had.
All Earthly Spirits also pressed do stand
Ready to do, what he shall them Command:
Those in the Fire yield a joint consent
To wait upon him in their Element.
Those in the Water, and the deepest Sea
All his Commands are ready to obey.
Those in the Air, and Astral Regions too,
Their constant service at his beck do show.
The holy Angels also do rejoice,
And pleasure Him who is the Highest's choice:
Thus all conspire to be his servants, and
With speed obey what he shall them Command,
Besides all these to him permitted it is,
To enter Gods own Treasury of Bliss,
In which he does Arcana's deep behold,
Not fit unto the World for to be told;
The great Archaeus of all things that be,
He does in every World and Astra see.
Divinely taught; divinely learned indeed,
He Heaven's Ca^al, and mysteries does read.
And thus is Heaven's Magitian a King
Upon the Earth, to whom all Creatures bring
Their homage due unto that Image, that
In him appears, of the Incorporat,
And increated Deity: And thus
Man is coequal with (nay more than) us.
What Adam lost he gains by this new Birth,
And is new-Crowned King, and God on Earth.
And such a Godlike King was Adam: Those skilled in divine Magic.
All
So should have been but for his fatal Fall:
But few, and very few attain to this
Great Pearl of Wisdom; Fruit of matchless Bliss,
Now in these latter days: But Mortals may
E're long behold, the mighty lustrous Ray
Of this fair Fruit; which I may call the Best,
For in it is contained all the rest.
Heaven's great Magitian mighty Moses had
Upon this Fruit by God's donation fed,
When ^e those Wonders in the Name of God
Did do in Egypt with his Magic Rod:
That Rod which to a S^rpent changed was,
And which again into a Rod did pass,
By this Fruit he God's MAGUS did become,
Performing Wonders in his mighty Name:
By this on Pha^oh, and all Egypt too,
He sev'n fold Plagues, and seav'n-fold Wonders threw.
By this the Seas he parts, which Crystal wa^ls
Become: the Israclites by this with Qualos,
And Manna bright he feeds; By this a knock
Opens the Springlets in the solid Rock.
By this he Gold makes potabl^; his face
With royal Rays, by this incircled was.
Mos^'s successor by this Magic too,
The strong-built walls of Ierico o'rethrew.
By it Gidion.
Ierubaal did overthrow
The Midians mighty Host without a blow.
Jesus with Heavenly Magic also fed
Four thousand people with sev'n Loaves of bread:
By it he fasted forty days; he by
The same did with invisibility
Adorn himself, and among a Multitude
Of foes, unseen he passed the row the Crowd.
By it he walked on the Seas, and yet
His soles the brinish Waters did not wet:
By it although the Doors fast locked were,
He could when ever it pleased him appear.
So Paul by the Caelestial Magi^'s might,
Deprived the Sorcerer Elymas of sight.
So Peter when Hel's Magus S^mon flew,
Through the Air, him from the Clouds he threw
Unto the Earth, by Heaven's true Magi^'s Skill,
Which Fall did both his Life, and Magic spill*
For Hel's dark Magic unto Heaven's must yield;
Nor dar^s that come, when this is in the Field.
With great-attention all this while attended
The Pilgrim, 'till the Angel thus had ended:
But rav^sh'd with the Knowledge of that Fruit
(Leave (...) given) he wi^h joy fell to 't:
Fell to that Feast which was more excellent
Than twenty thousand out-worlds Complement,
That Feast which by Heaven's proper Hand was dressed,
That Feast which by Heaven's sacred Breath was blessed:
That sacred ^^nquet which instal'd the man
Heaven's divine, and Arch-Magitian.
O with what pleasure, and delight he eat
On that Caelestial, and thrice sacred meat!
But yet with humble reverence he fed,
Bowing to Jesus for those gifts his Head,
Confessing still his own unworthiness,
Of that Felicity He did express.
But seeing Jesus by the Angel had
Granted him leave to eat, he freely fed.
Whilst thus the Pilgrim with a full content
Of ^oy, and Blis^e, and highest ravishment
Feeds on those blessed Fruits, an Angel from
The Aeternal Throne does to the Banquet come:
The presence of this unexpected Guest,
Star^l'd the Pilgrim, and rejoiced the rest.
Such Crowns of Glory sat upon his Head,
Such beams of Light about his Garments spread,
Such Heavenly Splendour flashed from his Eye,
That made him seem Heaven's fair Aepitomy.
With a fair speed he came, whilst the sweet air
Waved the soft streamlets of his golden Hair,
And ruffling his white Gown rubbed flame-tip'd darts
Against the tender Wounds of bleeding Hearts:
For his fair Garment powdered was all over
With flaming Arrows whose sharp points still bore
Themselves against fresh bleeding Hearts; the Wind
At every puff seemed cruel, and unkind,
For those by clashing seemed to wound indeed,
And these afresh to be inflamed and bleed.
These were the Ensigns of the Sacred'st Love,
At whose Command this Messenger did move.
But in his right Hand, all of shining Gold
Thick set with Rubies, he a Cup did hold;
Immortal Amaranthu^'s made up
Into a Purple Garland, Crowned the Cup.
But in the Mazure's golden Concave lay,
Of Wine of Love divine a blushing Sea;
A deep drought of that Heavenly Nectar which
Is broached for those who gain the highest pitch.
The Purple streams which fruitful Tmolus yields,
The exuberant Vines which crown the Massic Fields,
The Purple Grapes that on the R^ene do grow,
The scarlet Liquor that in Creet does flow;
Spains sprightly Nectar, Greece's pleasant wine,
Should they compared be to this divine
Ambrosiac Liquor, all of them would prove
But Gall, and Wormwood to this Wine of LOVE.
Approaching those who feasting were, on the
Choice Fruits excerp'd from Life's thrice sacred Tree,
The Angel on the Pilgrim pitched his Eye,
In which was placed a Throne of swavity,
And reaching to him that Wine-filled Boul,
From ^s fluent Tongue these melting words did roll.
Take here (said he) a Cup of sacred Wine,
Squeezed from the Grapes which grew on Iesu's Vine,
That Vine which spreads her spacious Branches even
Over all the fair walls of the Court of Heaven.
This is the new Wine which our Hearts does cheer,
Which brings gladness, and expels fear,
This is Lov^'s sacred Wine in it does move
The very Spirit of the King of Love,
Which is not flitting but for ever fixed,
For he himself is with this Liquor mixed.
Our royal King himself, commanded me
For to present this Present unto thee.
This said: the Pilgrim three times bowed, and
The Goblet took out of the Angels Hand,
And putting to his Ruby Lips the Cup,
With ravishment he drunk the Liquor up.
Not all the Honey streams of Hybla may,
Such gusts of sweetness to a Tongue display,
As what the Pilgrim tasted in that Boul,
As the Heav'n-nectarized Wine did roll
Into the Breast; He never yet did meet
With any Wine so ravishingly sweet;
So that the pleasure did beguile his draught,
For ever he was aware he deeply quafft:
The Boul was big, but had it bigger been
He would the bottom questionless have seen,
For here he knew he might drink in excess,
And without sin drink unto drunkenness,
For who can blame those holy Saints (this Odd
Expression pardon) who are drunk with God.
No sooner had the Pilgrim drunk of this;
But Living Flames of everlasting Bliss
Surround his Heart, whose clipings without measure
Yield Raptures, and unutterable pleasure.
The Wine's quick Spirits move in every part,
And corner of his Head, his Breast, and Heart,
And piercing the row each Limb, do cause them move
In sweet Tr^pudiations of Love.
Up starts he all inflamed (with that Flame
Which drove from David's breast Love stifling shame,
When he in an ecstatic Rapture danced
Before the Ark of God, as it advanced
The Row all the Streets of fair Jerusalem)
Taking the Graces all, he danced with them,
The holy Dance of Love: Nor can expressed
Be, that sweet prickling Joy reigned in his Breast.
His sense of feeling feasted to the hight,
And (as the rest were) swallowed in delight.
Unusual Gestures forced him to rear,
That he the better Love's excess might bear;
For Nature 's weak, and strives to Congregate
Those Spirits, which extreme Joys dissipate,
For Her own safety; lest by flying out
Too much, she should be quite left destitute.
Thus Flesh, and Blood, the Soul's Cross always is,
Depriving Her of Joys, of Sweets, of Bliss.
Not all the Joys and Pleasures the Dull World
On the most sensual Mortals ever has hurled;
Not all the Fleshes various pleasures, nor
Foul Cyprian delights themselves compare
May, with the smallest part of that delight,
And pleasue, which the Saints poor Souls ^^cite.
Vain are the World's Joy momentany too,
Heaven's everlasting, undefiled, and true.
O what Tongue able is to tell the pleasure
The Pilgrim felt! Not all the Earthly Treasure
Can purchase such delight; for the true God
Himself descended in a flaming flood,
Of Love, upon his Soul: Iesu's divine
And sacred Body, couched in the Wine
It self in pieces brake upon his Soul;
The sacred Spirit too, without control
Descending, filled all his Soul about,
With Rays of Light, and Love which naught could d' out.
Whole streams of Love upon his Soul was poured,
Festatic pleasures through the same were showred,
Seas of delight; unutterably sweet
Love-Extasies, his Soul together greet,
So that he was quite overcome of Love,
And did not know which way himself to move:
Intoxicated, and o'returned quite
He was, with Love's exuberant delight:
The burning T^ncture of the Heart of God,
Rol'd over his Soul a most delightful Flood,
Which him transported into Rapts divine,
So that he seemed like one made drunk with Wine.
In this strong heat of his exultancy,
He on the green grass swift about did fly,
With all those Graces, who composed a Ring,
And dancing round, this Hymn with joy they sing.
Hymn.
SAcred Flames of LOVE divine!
In our breasts untainted shine!
Feed upon our Souls! and let
Them unto the stake be set!
O Blessed Fires quickly come!
We 're prepared for Martyrdom!
Blessed is the Soul that dies
Unto LOVE a Sacrifice.
Blessed JESUS from thine Eye
There thrice sacred Flames did fly,
Which now burn without control
On the Tinder of our Soul,
Blessed Fires! O consume
What Is prepared for Martyrdom!
Happy is the Soul that dies,
Sacred LOVE'S true Sacrifice!
The Aetherial Flames that are
Couched in the Welkin fair,
Those that Crown the radiant Sun,
Those which beautify the Moon,
Are less fair than those which Come
For to Crown our Martyrdom.
Blessed is the Soul that dies,
LOVE'S unspotted Sacrifice!
O how raging! yet how sweet!
Are those burning Flames which greet
Our dry Souls, with scalding Kisses,
Pains dispensing, with our Blisses,
But such pains we wish to Come,
That give Crowns of Martyrdom:
Happy is the Soul that dies
Purest LOVE'S pure Sacrifice!
O our Souls are all on Fire!
We consume in our desire,
We desire what we possess,
Waters but our Fires increase,
Those bright Fires, which are Come,
To Crown Souls with Martyrdom.
O thrice blessed Soul that dies,
Purest LOVE'S blessed Sacrifice.
O what lingering Death is this!
Bliss inviteth us to Bliss;
By these tastes of Love we be
More enamored of the Sea
Of Abyssal Love, whence Come
Flames, to crown our Martyrdom:
Blessed is the Soul that dies,
LOVE'S most willing Sacrifice!
O what kind of pain is this!
Which is sweeter than all Bliss!
O it is pain intolerable,
Pleasure yet unutterable.
Such are the blessed Flames which come
TO Crown us with Love's Martyrdom.
Happy is the Soul that dies
Thus LOVE'S Living Sacrifice^
O we cry we cannot bear,
Love's hot flames which domineer
In our Breasts, and yet had we
Damned to Hell far rather be,
Than to lose these Flames which come
To Crown us with Martyrdom.
Blessed is that Soul that dies
Thus LOVE'S daily Sacrifice.
Fierce was the flame, and strong the happy heat,
Which on the Pilgrim's chafed Soul did beat:
Quick beat the pulses of his Noble breast,
High was the Tide of LOVE, which still encreast
Its scalding waves, so that he thought he should
Have lost his Life in that delicious Flood,
Such were Love's Ardors, he could scarce forbear
His fettering flesh, his free Soul's chains, to tear:
How often he mounted nimbly from the ground,
As if his Soul some passage thence had found:
How was he grieved to see he leaped in vain,
To see his Body bring her down again!
O how he wished that his Soul might be,
Now from the shackling gives of Flesh set free,
That she might spread her spacious wings, and fly,
The Row the wide Welkin of Aeternity,
Unto the illustrous Throne of Christ, and there
Among the Crowned Saints new clothed appear:
But chiefly that she without Letts might move
In the va^t Ocean of Aeternal LOVE.
For whilst that Flesh her freedom did restrain,
The more her pleasures was, the more her pain,
To be denied her Liberty, that she
Engulphed was not in that endless Sea:
Streams could not now content her; the Abyss
Of Love alone, must now complete her Bliss.
O happy Souls which in such Flames do move
And frying, thus LOVE'S blessed Martyrs prove.
But whilst Love's Noble Flames heat every part
Of 's Breast, and make a Bonfire of his Heart,
This blessed Pilgrim lifted up his eyes
Unto the glorious East of Paradise;
Where Worlds of glory rising from the place
Amazing Splendour hurled on his Face
And though it were all Day in Paradise,
A Sun, and greater Day began to rise.
A Light he saw, which springing from the East
All Paradise's lustrous braveries blessed,
Adding new glories to those Beauties, that
One would have thought could not have been more great.
The Rosie-cheek'd Aurora did embright
The glorious womb of Day with no such Light;
The Cynthian Goddess from the Orb did throw
No such bright Rays upon the World below:
Nor yet the flaming Giant of the Day,
Such streams and beams of Light did ever display:
Ten thousand Suns, ten thousand times more bright
Than ours, would not have paralelled this Light:
Needs must it dazzling be; what mortal eye
Can view the Splendors of Aeternity?
The Angels, and the Graces all, when they
Behold it clap their downy Wings for ^Joy,
And with due reverence thrice three times did bow
Their Heads, and kissed the flowery Pavement too.
As brighter Titan dims the lesser Stars,
So did this Light devour, that light of theirs.
As for the Pilgrim, on the ground he lay
Obstupified with that glorious Day;
But yet (with all the advantage he could make)
Of that illustrous sight a view did take.
A crowd of Clouds begilded with the Beams
Of the Aeternal Sun; whose radiant gleames
Had pierced the row them (so a small thin Cloud
I often have seen, when Sol himself did shroud
His face behind it from my eyes, grow clear,
And tincted the row, a various color were)
Appeared far brighter than our Sun below,
Dressed with more paintings than the Iris bow.
This Mask of Clouds was the Auro^a too
The Sun of Glory that close after flew;
But pitching in the midst of Paradise,
This bright (but yet a) Vail assunder flies,
And gave free leave for every Eagle eye
To see the bright Sun of Aeternity:
It was the Sun of Righteousness, who there
Did in his glorious Ornaments appear.
The Tongues of Men, nor Angels can unfold
That Glory which the Pilgrim did behold.
A stately Throne, more clear than Crystal glass,
Burnished with Heavenly Gold, erected was,
On which sat down Glories immortal King,
From whom all Happiness, and Blisses spring.
O glorious sight! who 'le not confounded be,
To see such Splendour, and such Majesty?
Upon his Head a starry fourfold Crown
Irradiating sat, from whence flowed down,
Fair, and soft Volumns of the purest snow,
Which spread upon his sacred back full low.
A fount of Light which filled all Paradise,
With Sun-like brightness flowed from his eyes.
His Paps were girded with a Golden Zone,
Of more than Cynthian luster was his Gown,
In 's Hand the Scepter, wherewith he did sway
The Worlds in Righteousness, and Justice lay.
But O the unutterable Majesty,
And Loveliness that in his Looks did lie!
A World of Wonders, and a ^on^rous Grace
Were to be spied in his sacred Face.
A Light more bright than tho^sand Suns, about
His Throne did flow from whence it issued out.
Behind was seen great Satan overthrown,
Death, Hell, the Wo^ld, and all things trodden down,
Under the glorious Lamb, who once was slain,
But now in triumph does for ay remain
Death's, and Hel's darts were broke, over whom he stood
Encompassed with an illustrous flood
Of Light ineffable, displaying there
His Conquest, written in a Banner fair;
The blessed Cross in Heaven's bright Ensign shon,
With streaming Gold, far brighter than the Sun?
So what was once contemptible and base,
Now stands in Glory in the highest place.
There also seen were those, who had put on
Their new Bodies, and gained their royal Crown,
And Scepter, whom great Jesus did instal,
Princes, and Kings, and mighty Lords of all,
Sharing his Royal Sc^pter, and his Crown
(Such is his matchless Love) with every One.
Thrice bowed the Ang^ls, thrice the Graces, and
Took up their places then* on either hand,
Awaiting when they should Commanded be
To any Office, by his Majesty.
The amazed Pilgrim as yet prostrate lay,
Too weak to view the Godhead's glorious Ray,
But the same Light which his weak eyes annoys,
His Soul filled with incomparable ^oyes,
And still the flames of ardent LOVE did roll
Upon the Altar of his sacred Soul.
But by and by his Guardian Angel Came,
(By Jesus first b'ing bid to do the same)
Who raised him up, and spread his downy Wing,
Before his feeble sight, and so did bring
Him to the Throne of Jesus at whose Seat
He fell, and ravished kissed his sacred Feet.
The immortal King^strait took him from the place,
And honored Him with a divine Embrace,
Sealed all the Joys, the Pleasures, Blisses, sweets,
Upon his ravished Soul, an Angel meets
With, in his blessed station: O high
Exalted Pleasures of Aeternity!
The Pilgrim then to Jesus would have Cried
((...) that the Rapt his Tongue had chained, and tied)
That he unworthy was of all that Bliss,
Those favors, and that matchless Love of his:
And (...) he would have had his Tongue confess,
His constant frailty, and unworthiness:
His Heart confessed it but his Tongue was mute,
For Joys, and Pleasures would not let him do 't;
For that Embrace unto his Soul did move,
Enflaming more, and more the Fire of Love,
Whose heats at last unto that hight did come,
That he received there a Martyrdom.
Such matchless pleasures now enjoyed this Saint
That neither mine, nor Angels Pens depaint
Can: nor Man think who never felt the same,
Who never into Love's Arms, and bosom came:
But such they were, and of such price to Him,
That thou^and Worlds should not have purcha'st them.
Nay such they were, he would be content to gain
Such Pleasures, with ten thousand years of pain.
Therefore O Man! be wise: and let not this
World's pleasures rob thee of Aeternal Bliss!
Muse breath a while, and give me leave to pray,
That I a Pilgrim too, may once enjoy
Such happiness, and high exalted Bliss,
Such Pleasure, Rapture, and such Joy as this,
Then shall thou sing, touched with Caelestial Fire
Of LOVE Divine, in sacred Notes, much higher
Than these low strains: Thy Lively measures then
Shall quicken up the drowsy Hearts of Men
From their Lethargic sleep: True Joy, and glee
Shall sweetly Couched in thy Number^ be.
True Joy's, true Peace's, Rest's, and Blisses King!
I Will sigh, and mourn 'til thou say rise, and sing:
'Till thou say rise, and sing, I Will Sigh, and Mourn:
By me the Cross (not yet the Crown) is worn.
Lord when thou please Crown my Soul; that I
In Joy may Sing thy Praise Aeternally!
The end of the Second Part.
THE EXPLANATION OF AN Hieroglyphical Figure, SHOWING THE MYSTERIES OF THE
External, Internal, and Eternal WORLDS.
The third Part.
ONce more my sacred Muse does take her flight,
And on the top of glorious SION light:
Where she beholds those glorious wonders, which
For ever the Aeternal World enrich:
Those Wonders, and those Miracles of Grace,
Which beautify, and splendorize the place:
Those Wonders that are past her Skill to show,
Which if she could, it were not fit to do,
For there such glorious Wonders may be read,
As are not lawful to be uttered:
But what she may, and what she Can express,
She shows unto you in a homely dress,
Accept I pray, this Offering she brings:
For Rapt with Wonders, all amazed she sings.
O Thou Aeternal Everlasting Day!
Illuminate my darker Soul I pray!
O let her eyes be fixed upon thee,
Thou King of Glories and of Majesty!
Grant that she may behold those Wonders, that
The Aeternal World, thy blessed Seat, decorate.
O now inspire me with a Power divine,
Put Life into my Numbers, sacred Trin^!
That whilst Heaven's beauteous Glories, here I sing
Unto your Throne I Souls may ravished bring;
That whilst my own, w^apt in these Hea^s does see
Heaven's Splendour, and thy glorious Beauty, she
May be united to the Lord! so close
That nor the World, nor Hell the tie may loose;
That while to others thus I sing, I may
O Lord! not be my self a Castaway.
Ho! Mo^us cease to Carp; Ho! Zoilus Cease
Your scoffs, and taunts; Ho! Critics hold your peace,
And say not now I Miracles rehearse,
Beyond the lof^y Limits of a Verse,
Say not I write my Brainsick-Whimsies, Lies,
Or Fables, or I merely Po^tize:
Ye are the Swine who grunting in the mire
Would spoil the music of the sacred Quire,
But for your dissonance, and grunt'ling noise,
The World might often hear a Se^^ph's voice:
Piggs think their whining best; the jetting Crows
Themselves the fairest of Heaven's Fowls suppose:
The Owls, and Cuccows, think their Notes to be
(...) sweet as Philomel's sweet harmony.
So you suppose your Canting best; and then
Like snarling Currs, do Carp, and snap at Men.
You 're Swine indeed whose dull eyes still below
Behold the earth, and hunt, and scent your trough;
Your necks are too too short to view the Sky,
How come you then to judge of things so high;
Because some Wind-fals on the ground you see,
Think you no fairer Fruit hangs on the Tree?
Swine cannot look up; it is a Man alone
Not slothful Beasts can pull the fair Fruit down.
Buzzards are blinded by Sol's glorious Rays:
Eagles unhurt against his splendour gaze.
Here then are Pearls, but unto wise Men such,
But wrapped in pitch least Swine such gemms should touch.
Pearls must not naked be exposed to Swine,
(So said that mouth that wholly was divine)
Least that they trample, and despise the same,
And Him, who so unwisely offered them.
Therefore a wise Man cautiously shrouds
Gemms of great value in obscurer Clouds:
And in the Pitch of Words those Pearls divine
Hides, from the eyes of such perverting Swine,
Which in their spendrous beauties otherwise,
Should Vail-less be exposed to their eyes.
But now me thinks I hear them Carp, and say
How come you thus Heaven's beauties to display?
And the Arcana's of the Aeternal Sphere,
When you your self never arrived there?
If you should tell us that you were; we cry
We are assured that it is a lie,
For none to Heaven ever can attain,
Whilst his kept-Soul does in his Corpse remain;
For when the Body's dead, the Soul then flies
To Heaven (and not before) above the Sky.
To such whose Breasts are with such thoughts implete,
I shall (and in a word) this Answer ^it.
Paul was alive and yet to Heaven he flew,
Where he such wondrous mysteries did view,
That as they were unutterable, so
They were not fit ^or to be told below.
The Patriarch Aenoch walked with God? and there
Is Heaven doubtless, where he does appear
In Love, and Glory: so Aelias went
To Heaven before his mortal Spirits were spent.
But such whose thoughts are thus; do heaven tie
Unto a place above the star^y Sky,
Such don't believe the Scriptures, which declare
That also they within Man seated are:
Indeed the Aeternal Heavens are boundless, they
In Man, and out of Man themselves display.
I say they 're boundless; for the God of Bliss
Is boundles, and they are where e're he is.
Nay Heaven (though strange it seem) is too in Hell:
And there does (as L^ght does in darkness) dwell:
As Night cannot Day, as Darkness cannot the Light,
So cannot Hell ever comprehend the bright
Aeternal Heaven: as't cannot excluded be,
So not included by Demensity.
Did Man himself but truly thoroughly know,
He Would find all Wo^lds that are, within Him flow:
Man's a deep study: and who M^n does see
Truly, and thoroughly knows all Worlds that be.
It Is very true if Heaven only were
Beyond the blew Seas of the starry Sphere,
Our Souls enchain'd below could never come
Thither, till they had left their fleshly home,
For that our Elemental Bodies are
Too heavy, to be carried so far.
But Aenoch walked with God on Earth, and so
May Man on Earth be, and see Heaven too.
O thou that gazeth on the Olympic Court,
Fancying beyond it the Majestic Port,
And Restful Haven of departed Souls,
Whose breadth extends unto either Poles,
Where mighty Mansions for the Saints do lie
Spread over the vast, and starry Canopye:
Carnal Conceits of splendid Palaces!
(...) grossly Brain-deluded Images!
Did thou but know the Nature of a Soul
Such fancyful Idea's thou would control:
For nothing is more near than Heaven to thee,
Were thou not blind; had thou but eyes to see.
The deeper into thy self do go,
The nearer thou still Heaven approachest to.
For what is indeed a Souls departure hence,
But motion from the Circumference
Unto the Center, let it Center where
It will, or in the Light, or darker Sphere?
Had thou a Po^er granted thee to fly
Ten thousand t^mes as far beyond the Sky
As it is to 't; as far from Heaven thou
Might be (God's Seat I mean) as thou art now.
Heaven is spiritual (yet real too)
So that our outward carnal Eyes cannot view
Its Seat: The Soul which is a Spirit may,
Yea whilst it is prisoner in this house of Clay:]
Though I confess this Clayie Vail is such,
That intervening it does hinder much
These outward eyes can nothing view but what
Is gross, material, and Corporate:
Rather more tru^y they do nothing view,
(No more than the Perspective we look through
Is said to see, for it is the eye, so) it is
The Soul, and nothing else that views, and sees.
What sees the Body, when the Soul is fled?
The Organ still remains the same, though dead,
Yet it no visive Power has, for why
The Soul once gone, of no use is the eye.
So likewise it is (as plainly it appears)
The Soul that feels, that smells, that tastes, that hears.
But now the Soul without a Body may
Nor see, nor hear, touch, taste, or smell I say:
Mistake me not I pray? I mean not now
This Flesh, and Blood; this gross out-garment though
For this indeed is as it were a foul
Garment, unto the Body of the Soul:
Which is its prison; and the fruit (which all
Men bear) of Adam's fell, and fatal Fall:
For this Imagination did indue
This Body, when he put his mind into
This extern Principle; which once shall be
Int 's Ether swallowed to Aeternity.
Suppose you had a Robe of Lead made fit
Unto your Body, and that put in it;
Your Face, and Hands, all parts covered over,
Against your eyes thick Glasses: as before
You could not see; how dim the World would show?
How heavily should you then move, and go?
Could you so nimbly scud across the Plain?
Or sprightly swim within the silver Main
As you before did? should a wedg of Steel
Fall hard upon you, should you not it feel?
And should your glass eyes stopped be with clay,
You could not then behold one glimpse of Day.
But should you freed be from that Prison, then
How fair, and clear would all things show again?
Just so it is with the Soul: a heavy foul
Garment, unto the Body of the Soul
This fleshly Case is: whilst it foully decks
It, The Soul.
she does labor under its defects,
And must be subject unto them; then she
If that the eyes be d'outed cannot see
The outward World; let any part of this
Organic Body be but ought amiss,
She is afflicted with it; by this tie
Of flesh she thus endures misery.
But the Soul's Body is another thing,
Which in, and through this fleshly Case does spring,
Not to be seen with fleshly eyes; so you
May see the Sun, but not that Body view
Which gives it splendour; so you view the flame,
But not that Body which Lives in the same.
For the true Elements they are not seen
By eyes Corporeal; it is an outer Screen
You view: the Body of the Soul likewise,
From the unmixed Element does rise.
This is the Body that to Heaven does fly,
Who gains this Body, gains the Mystery;
For through it he Heaven may view, though he
In his corporeal Clayie House still be;
Who fixes this may there for ever dwell,
For he those Wonders views that Worlds excel.
It Is in this Body that the Soul does see
The immortal Glories of Aeternity.
It Is plain that all, or most great Visions, that
The sacred Scriptures to us do nominate,
Not with the outer were beheld, but by
The Heav'n-beholding, and internal eye.
What outward Eye can see a Sp'rit, unless
He does himself int' form, and matter press?
What outer eye is able, then to see
The Form, or glory of Heaven's Majesty?
An Angel's fain to vail his splendid beams
With some gross matter, when himself it seems
He will discover to the extern eye of Man,
What extern Eye can see the Heaven's glories then?
With what eye did Elisha's Man behold
The fiery Host that did them safe enfold?
With what Eye was it that Eze^iel spied
That glorious Vision by clear Chebar's side?
With what Eye did he see Jerusalem
When he in Chald^ captive did remain?
With what Eye was it that great Daniel saw
Himself (though then at Shushan) at Aelai?
By what sight saw he (when sleep sealed his eyes)
The great Creator in the Aeternal Skies?
And how could Steven with his outer eye
See Jesus sitting in the Aemperial Sky
At God's right Hand? You know the glorious Sun
Which round this Orb in twice twelve hours does run,
By three times fifty, and sixteen degrees
Exceeds the World: But who that Planet sees
Deems him but small: How far beyond that Star,
As they account the Emperial Heaven's are
You may imagine, when the space they 'count
'Twixt Earth, and the eighth Heaven, to surmount
Sev'nteen hundred millions of Miles and more,
How vast a distance did Steven's eye therefore
Behold our Savior? But that eye by which
He say, no bounds to it can distance pitch.
Paul's eyes were closed; with what eye saw He
The Glory then of Heaven's bright Majesty?
Peter entranced was; with what eye Beheld
He then, the sheet with clean, and unclean filled?
And lastly with what Eye, and with what Ear,
did divine John in Patmos see, and hear?
If thus the Eye may Heaven see* also
The Body of that Eye may thither go.
It is not strange to them therefore that are
Acquainted, with true notions of that Sphere
Wherein I^hov^h, and the Angels be,
That Man on Earth the Aeternal Heaven's may see:
For such do know how Souls abstracted may
Be, from their House of impediting clay,
And that whilst in their Bodies they remain,
May Heaven (by Faith not only) here attain;
And be conversant in the highest Sphere,
Abstracted from the World though they dwell here.
But least (because I here so stiffly plead)
You should suppose I have been there indeed;
I will confess (as 'counting it great shame
To be accounted better than I am)
That I not worthy have accounted been;
O no I cleans'd am not am enough from Sin)
I am a Pilgrim and do thither wen,
Strong is my Faith I shall come there: Amen!
Assured I am, although a very few
Att^in (whilst here on Earth) this Court unto,
That here on Earth it may attained be,
Though Flesh, and Blood impeed its clarity.
But you that ask me how I come to know
Those things of Heaven which I here do show?
Since (as I do confess) I have not been
There, nor those myst'ries that I speak of seen.
Pray tell me also then how you come by
Your knowledge of a Heaven beyond the sky?
Were you e're there; Yet confidently you
Discribe the place, affirm your notion true*
You Will tell the Joys of everlasting Bliss
Describe the Glory that in Heaven is;
And will you then (if you did never see
The place you speak of) angry be with me,
For doing what your selves do daily do?
You say it is UP to Heaven; and that is true:
And is it not also INTO Heaven? you will grant
That God's the Center of all things: and shall not
The Center which is inmost highest be;
Or Up, or In it is all one to me:
But this I know that Heaven (and also Hell
Though separate) in every place do dwell.
Although (as I confess) I have not been
In Heaven, nor there its spendid glories seen,
Yet I account it grace enough to be
The Praec^ of his heavenly Majesty:
I may the Candle hold, and light the way
Into the place of everlasting Day:
I may the Mercury be to guide aright
Caelestial Pilgrims, with my glimmering sight;
We may see right unto the Mountain's top,
And point the way whilst we are getting up,
Unto our fellow-Travellers, that they
(if faster go they can) may see the Way:
We Joy if by our means aright they move;
Those that see more may thank us for our Love.
That upper Globe which you see pourtrai'd there,
Does represent the high Eternal Sphere,
This is the highest Noblest, brightest, best,
The Glory, Life, and Center of the rest,
The place of mighty Wonders, the divine
Seat of the sacred everlasting Trine:
The habitation of the blessed Saints,
Where glorious Angels spread their heavenly Tents:
Where stands Mount Sion, and the glorious Lamb,
Where is SOPHIA, and Jerusalem.
This is the everlasting place of rest,
The Heaven, the habitation of the blessed:
This Man may find in the deep Center, and
How this through all devolveth understand.
Here is the spacious glassie Sea; and the
Crystalline Earth, the Air of Purity,
The purest fire; which conjoined in one,
The matter is of the Caelestial Throne
Of Everlasting Joys: This place it is
The Empyreum, and the Seat of Bliss:
GOD out of Nature Comprehended may
Not be; a Nothing so to us I say
He seems, but as he Himself does show
In the Eternal Forms of Nature, so
We apprehend him can; The Father then
Has from Eternity begot the Son;
This Birth's the Heart of God, which ever was,
And though begot yet 't no beginning has;
From whence proceeds the sacred Spirit, who
From both begotten is Eternal too.
All three distinct in Person, yet but One
Aeternal GOD in a strict Union.
This is the Mystery of the sacred Trine,
Which in this everlasting Orb does shine,
But now the The first Principle.
Father with a strong desire,
Thirsts for the The second Principle.
Son, from whence springs up a Fire,
Which Fire not reaching God's most sacred Heart,
Is full of Anguish, Bitterness, and Tart.
This is the Fire that inkindleth Hell,
Where all the damned, and the Devils dwell;
But the same Fire, when that sacred LOVE
Or Second Principle.
Heart of God, it self to it does move
Strait blazeth forth, into a meek and Bright
Joy, and desire of Aeternal Light?
This is the Light of Heaven, and pleasant Joy,
In which all Bliss is, not the least annoy.
And thus O Reader! if thou are not blind,
Heaven's Bliss and Joy, Hel's pain, and torment find
Thou will to come from one deep Root; and even
Perceive the true cause both of Hell, and Heaven.
And thus thou see how they together dwell,
Hell hid in Heaven; Heaven in the midst of Hell;
And yet so great a Gulf between, that they
In Hell behold not the least glimp^e of Day;
Nor they in Heaven feel the least of woe,
Their separation's thus Eternal too.
Though Similies are too too base to show
This Mystery of Mysteries of Mysteries to you,
But that our weak, and duller eyes may see
More clear by them think on this Simile.
Take thou a lighted Tapor, put it out,
The week thou 'lt see with Fire glow thr'owour,
From whence a stinking vapor, and a Fume
Displeasing to thy nosethrils fills the room,
The stinking glowing weik gives little light,
And the Fire far does differ from a bright
And burning Tapor; Light the same, and then
Thou Wilt see the former darkness fled again;
Thou Wilt see a blaze which from the weik does rise,
With a bright splendid Glory before thine eyes,
Which Blaze without the Fire could not be made,
The Fire's without that blaze a deady shade;
The Heat, and Light distinct and several be,
Though jointly they do in the blaze agree,
Nor can the (...) without the I mean in the Tapor, for otherwise it were
false, for heat may be without Light, and Light without Heat contrary to the
opinion of the Peripateticks, learnedly proved by Sir Christopher Heyden,
Heat have being,
But jointly in (...) agreeing
They make that Glory, brighter than the Gold,
Which in a lighted Ta^or we behold;
But Heaven's splendr^^^ Light does not contain
Such scorching heat as (...) such L^gh^^ remain.
The Application's very (...): It Is ^ven
Thus 'twixt the Fire of ^ell, and Light of Heaven.
For the first Principle alone makes Hell,
But Heaven, when the Second in it does dwell;
The first is to the second even as
The Fire which makes the glowing weik to blaze,
From whence proceeds the Light, the Joy, the Bliss
That in the high Aeternal Heaven is.
Here in this Sphere those mighty Wonders be,
Which (...) the sporting of the Deity,
Themselves dis^lay: Wonders indeed they are
Which do exceed Man's comprehension far.
Here'tis that God himself to himself displays,
From whence the sense arises up in ^oys.
A thousand thousand things for aye arise,
AEternal Waters, and Eternal S^ies:
Hence Parad^^e, and the internal Orbs,
Do cloth themselves in their illustrous Garbs;
Should all the Stars for Counters serve, they were
Too few, to number all the Wonders here.
Whilst I am wrapped in meditating them,
I am amazed, amazement stops my Pen.
Here Loves, and Glories do unite in one:
Here is that three-times sacred Union
'Twixt God and Man: betwixt the Deity
And the immaculate Humanity;
From whence the Lillies, and the Wonders grow,
From whence the Joys of Love, and Bliss do flow,
This is the marriage of the sacred Lamb:
The Soul returns here from whence it came,
With the additions of Aeternal Bliss:
SOPHIA to the Soul united is,
The Soul to Her, the virgin Body here:
Such are the Joys, and Blisses of this Sphere.
Man of all Worlds is an Aepitomy,
And with all Worlds that are he does agree,
Ah why should the outward Captivate him so,
As he the rest should not so truly know!
That ah p^epostrous! the outward World should have
Most rule in Him, and all the rest in slave,
Or hide them from his eyes, so deeply, that
He thinks those Worlds, and He are separate.
The outer Case of Flesh does represent
The outer world, in which the others vent
Themselves: the internal worlds themselves do spread
About the Heart; the Eternal in the Head.
So are they placed in Man, and so they be
In the inner ground, as all the Wise do see.
All outer pleasures of the World do stretch
Themselves but to the Flesh, and do but reach
The outer senses: Carnal pleasures flow
In lower Regions, and are left below.
The internal worlds are opened in the Breast,
There Paradise, and all its Joys expressed
Are; there likewise the darker Worlds harsh source
It self in Anguish, and in pain does force.
The sense of feeling lies in that part,
And Paradise does open in the Heart.
But what from this Eternal Sphere is shown,
Within the Center of the Head's made known:
For there the eye, and ear are manifest,
To which all sights and heavenly sounds expressed
Are: all the Wonders of this higher Sphere
When they are shown are manifested there.
This is a Mist'ry unto those that know
No other Worlds but this out- world below.
But to our Pilgrim let us now return;
Whose progress shall to those who will not spurn
The Truth, make known some Myst'ries of this Sphere
Which may be shown; but those that thus appear,
For scorners sakes a little veiled must be,
And yet our Vailes are made of Tiffany;
So that an Eye not altogether blind
The sense, and meaning of our words may find.
Our happy Pilgrim, who in Paradise
In Bliss, and pleasure in Love's bosom lies,
Feeling those pleasures that do scorn annoy,
And breathing in the Fire of purest Joy,
Does Heaven already as it were possess,
Seated in Bliss, and crowned with Happiness.
But Love's immortal Prince does now relate
To him the glory of an higher state,
He being fitted by the Prince of Love
For this ascension, now must farther Move.
O here it lies not in the Will of Man,
For one step selfly forward move he can
Not; here it must be Jesus he alone
Conveighs the Soul to this Caelestial Throne: John 15. I am the Door.

Who whilst it is wholly passive, swiftly whurl'd
Is, in Love's Coach into the Eternal World.
The silver Clouds of Paradise do meet
In a Conjunction, and at Iesu's feet
Conspire; who with the Pilgrim back, those clear
Clouds, mounting thence into The Eternal Sphere.
But e're the Pilgrim went the Graces all
Approaching him into his Lap let fall
Their Royal bounties all desiring He
TO accept those small Presents would pleased be:
For by their virtue he his subjects might
Rule (seated in his Royal Throne) aright.
FAITH gave her golden Shield beset with Gemnis,
Whose sight Hel's mighty Monarch fears it seems,
As much as Mortals did that Buckler dread
On which was portrayed cursed Medusa's Head;
For when so e're he spies that glorious Shield,
Screeching and howling he deserts the Field.
A golden Anchor he received from HOPE,
Which not the force of Hell could ever pull up,
When once 'twas fixed; upon the Billows ride
He safely could, and all Hel's storms abide
Without the least of Danger, and by this
In midst of Storms, h' in mist of safety is.
ZEAL brought a Sword whose hilt with glittering Gold
Shan; from whose two-edged blade flames sprightly rold;
The Stygian Princes flesh no Weapon but
This terrible two-edged Sword can cut:
This is the Sword of the blessed Spirit, and
Hell for his furies can its force withstand.
A Royal Miter profer'd PIETY,
Which Crowned the Pilgrim's royal brows on high,
The Helmet of Salvation it was,
O'relaid with Gold, and framed of solid Brass,
Which all Hel's Thunderbolts could never pierce,
Nor all his shafts, though they were never so fierce.
COURAGE a Breast Plate gave of solid Steel,
Through which he Hel's black Arrows could not feel,
Of Righteousness it was, whose shining glass
Retorted Hel's black shafts into his face,
So that the more he seeks to wound his foes
The more by's own shafts shall his damage grow.
True JOY a Royal Robe presented, where
All Paradise's flowers embossed were,
Love framed the stuff, and Innocence wrought
Into true True-Love-Knots all that Joy brought.
This Robe could not defiled be with sin:
If Hell flings Dirt on it, it falls off ag'en.
An upright Staff UPRIGHTNESS gave for guide,
A golden pair of Comp^sses beside,
By which all Actions measured ought to be,
Beyond whose bounds his steps ought not to flee;
Whilst by that Staff and Compasses he goes,
Hell nor the World did dare his Way oppose.
TRUTH she presented him the sacred Writ,
In which he might behold all things that fit
Were to be done, and what to be eschew'd.
HUMILITY a Van to sift the Proud
Actions, and Thoughts; to sift the Chaff and the
Cockle, from the bright Wheat of Purity.
OBEDIENCE a silvet wheel presented,
By which all adverse Thoughts, to be tormented
Were, and all Actions that did Rebels prove
Unto the Laws, and Crown of sacred Love:
By which close-grinding Wheel, the flowr was taken
From the enclosure of the fruitless Bran.
But RESIG^ATION gave a golden Cross,
In which contained was not one grain of dross,
Love's glorious badge, where all Opposers died,
And where all humane Wills were crucified:
A Cross on which who hung, were mounted even
From Death to Life; from Earth to highest Heaven.
(...) WISDOM gave a pair of Balances,
Whose Scales the impartial Hand of Justice weighs;
Whereby He able was to weigh aright,
And the true Gold to know from what was light.
All something gave, to whom his thanks b'ing pai'd,
To the highest Sphere Love's Coach its voyage made.
Swifter than Eagles in a full Career,
They mounted up into the Aeternal Sphere:
Such was their speed, such was their sudden flight,
As it deprived Him of the Act of sight.
So that he scarcely could denote, or tell
What in that sudden wrapped to him befel^.
His Soul enflamed with the purest Love,
Did in Aliah's fiery Chariot move,
Cutting their way through that unseen Sky
Which fast together all the Worlds does tie,
Which is the Medium, whereby Souls do go
Unto the highest Orb, from Orbs below:
This Waye's the Ladder whereby Angels move,
From lower Spears, unto the Spears above.
This ^ adde^'s basis fastly fixed is here*
Whose top does mount into the highest Sphere,
This is the Path of Souls, and who finds this,
Has found the way unto the Highest Bliss:
But he that finds this, Jacob's Mo^s oeuli c^b^l.
sleep must find,
Or else he seeks in vain, and grasps the Wind;
Caelestial VENUS with a glittering Ray
And beam of Light immortal, points the Way
Unto the entrance of the Aeternal Orb,
Which 'gan to glitter now with fires Superb;
Whose lustrous Splendors the ^aint Pilgrim drove
Into a stupor 'tween the Arms of Love;
Who there annoynting with a Salve his eyes,
Entered that Orb, and bid him see, and rise
Within the Circle of the Aeternal Sphere.
Three Orbs of glory, and three worlds appear,
Three several Mansions, outer, inner, inmost,
Answering to Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
To Light, to Life, and to Eternal Love:
Myriads of Angels about which do move.
Our holy Pilgrim having entered now
Into the Eternal World, himself does bow
Under the Ensign of that glorious Cross,
Which in its glory there advanced was.
A Silence unexpressable was there,
Nothing but stillness in that sacred Sphere,
For all that Orb, where now our Pilgrim went
Encircl'd was with the One Element.
Here he beheld the bright and sparkling Eye
Of Providence, and of Aeternity.
Here He beholds those Wonders I confess
My Tongue and Pen too weak are to express,
And here he feeds upon those fruits that grow
Upon the Tree of Life's superbest bough.
Here He becomes a true Magitian,
Here He becomes in Jesus Christ a Man.
Here now his eyes are so illuminate,
That they through all things that are penetrate.
Here he in Silence waits upon that Eye
Which sparkles in this Still-Aeternity.
Words cannot speak this Bliss: nor I declare
Can more; or if I could I should not dare.
But now the goodness of a matchless Love,
Commands the Pilgrim once again to move,
Who mounting higher comes to that abode
Which ever E^chos with the Name of God:
The second Orb of the Aeternal World
This is; arrived here his eyes he hurld
On every side: on every side he saw
Those beams of Light, and everlasting Day*
Which darted down from New Jerusalem,
With Life, Light, Glory did that Orb behemm.
Here he beholds the glorious Lambs abode,
Here he beholds the sacred Heart of God,
Here he beholds thrice blessed EMANUEL,
Here he beholds where all the Angels dwell,
Thousands of thousands sees he there to bide,
Placed in their orders upon either side,
And though that some higher than others were,
In this respect, they all were equal there,
In that they all were full there was no want,
Though some had more than some, yet none did scant;
So smaller vessels filled till they run over,
Cannot complain if they can hold no more,
Against another vessel, though he may
Contain, it may be thrice as much, as they:
When all are filled to the very brim,
All are content, and all alike do seem.
Thus largest Souls shall have the largest share,
Of Glory, yet all full; no want is there:
Love's measured, but by their Capacity,
All are implete, and all but full can be.
There Hallalu jah's sounds in his ears.
There sacred Songs of praise, and Joy he hears;
There all the pleasure of Aeternal Bliss,
In hight of Glory, still triumphant is:
Words are too weak: And these Arcana's shall
Be known to none; Til GOD himself reveal.
Great is his Love, and great his Wonders be,
Those shall confess them, that this Orb shall see.
But O the Bliss Eternal that does move
In constant streams, down from the Heart of Love
Upon the Pilgrim's Soul: so strong the blisses
Are, of Love's flaming, and berapting Kisses
That down he falls before the sacred Lamb,
Pressed with the impresses of Love's sacred flame.
His heart's inflamed, and full of Love divine,
His Face with radiant beams of Light does shine,
His Soul ^ndued with a Life Supernal
Ca^n't dye; for all his ^oys are now Eternal.
O(...) are wanting here for to express
The t^^usandth part of such an happiness.
But one flight more, but one step more there is
For to Complete our Pilgrim's Joy, and Bliss:
Here he awaiteth for the Spirit his guide,
That as ascended, so he glorified
Might be; his eye now fixed is on thy Throne,
Awaiting for that mystic Union,
Which as with Wonder, so with Joy, delight
And everlasting pleasure fill it might.
The time is come, and now by gracious Love
He does into Sanctum Sanctorum move,
Into the holiest now of holiest, he
Admitted is, where dwells the Deity
In Light immortal, where the blessed abode
Is of the sacred Trine, the Triune GOD.
There in immortal Glory, great IEHOVE,
There blessed JESUS, and the sacred DOVE
Conjoined in one, make up the blessed TRINE,
A mystery as sacred, as divine.
Behold the Pilgrim now is come in view Rev. 12. 16, 17, etc.

Of the third Orb Jerusalem the New,
With all her glories glittering in that Sphere
Bride-like adorned does to his eyes appear.
Glories of glories does adorn the place,
The Wal's like Jasper or the Crystal Glass;
Four square the City is, on every side
Equal: the length, the breadth, the height divide
Int' equal parts. Both great and high the Wall
Is, of this sacred and Caelestial
JERUSALEM; Her twelve Foundations
Are laid with twice six several precious Stones.
The first is JASPER; as transparent as
The glorious Morning; or the crystal Glass, Augustine in Civitate De.

Glorious Saint PETER'S great, and glorious Name
Deeply insculpted is upon the same.
The second SAPHIR, which does court the eye
With all the beauties of the Azure Sky:
On which engraven is the name of PAU^*
The second beauty of this Heavenly Wall.
The third a CHALCEDONY, which does show
Like flames above, and glowing coals below;
Engraven deep the name of JOHN divine
On it, does with glorious splendour shine.
The fourth an EMRAULD whose Caelestial
And verdant glories beautify the Wall:
There Zebedean JAMES his glorious Name
With equal Luster beautifies the same.
The fifth's a SARDONIAE, whose blushing dies,
The Wall as Phoebus does the Morning skies:
Alphean JAMES'S Name is graven here,
And with a wondrous Luster does appear.
The sixth a SARDIUS is: which does imbue
The sacred Wall with more than scarlet hew;
Blessed Saint ANDRE^'S holy name does own
A splendid place upon that blushing Stone.
The seav'nth a CRYSOLITE whose Croseam beams
Paint all the side with thousand golden streams,
Saint MATTHEW'S Name most glorious to behold
Shines there engraved, and wrapped in purest Gold.
The eighth a BERIL of a glorious hew,
Which paints the Wall at once both green, and blew:
The name of SIMON does it self display
There graven deep; which shall remain for aye.
The ninth a TOPAZ, which with Lustrous Rays
And verdant streams, its beauty there displays.
Saint BARTHOLOME^'S blessed name does also stand
Engraven there by an Almighty Hand.
The tenth a CRYSOPRASUS, which is seen
To paint the Wall at once with Gold, and green.
Shining in Heavenly Luster THOMAS his
Illust'rous Name on it engraven is.
The Eleventh is a HYACINTH, whose flame
The golden splendour of the Sun does shame.
With blessed Saint PHILLIP'S name engraved thereon,
Which glowing there seems written in the Sun.
The twelfth an AMETHIST, whose blushing shine
Out-braves the Rosy hew of Cretian Wine,
VVhereon the glorious name of blessed JUDE,
By God engraved in triumph there is showed.
Her everlasting Gates were three times four,
One entire Pearl does serve for every door,
On which in most resplendent Glory dwell
The names of the twelve Tribes of Israel.
The dainty streets pure Crystal does enfold,
And the whole City is of massy Gold,
But yet transparent as the brightest Gemm
Unto Spectators blessed eyes does seem.
Through the middle does Life's River flow,
Upon whose banks the Tree of Life does grow.
The glorious Splendour of the blessed Lamb
Is Sun, and Moon unto JERUSALEM:
The Glory of the Lord does always sit
There to embrighten, and o're-shadow it:
Night's banished thence; the Lamb's resplendant Ray
Indues it with an everlasting Day.
The Lamb the only stately Temple is
Of this great City of everlasting Bliss.
O here remains the everliving Word!
O here remains the Glory of the Lord!
Lo there the Lamb upon mount Sion's top
Triumphant stands with all his Virgin Troop:
There all the Elders with their glorious Crowns,
To Judge the world sit in their splendid Thrones.
Lo there the everlasting SON of GOD
Clothed with immortal Rays, makes his abode.
Lo there the blessed Saints, and Angels be
Clothed with Robes of Immortality,
Whose glittering brows are Crowned with Diadems
Chased with e'rlasting, and Caelestial Gemms.
Here Glory, Praise, and Hallalujah's be
Sung to the LAMB to all A^ternity.
Here is the Book of Life, the Heavenly Stone,
The glorified Mame, the immortal Th^one
Of Bliss, and everlasting Joys: And here
The new, and glorified Bodies are.
This is the secret Sacred Place; this is
The glorious Kingdom of everlasting Bliss:
This is the Mansion House, and the abode
Of JESUS, and of all the Sons of GOD:
O here is the Rock of Wonders, and here is
The hidden Treasure of Aeternal Bliss.
O here the Saints, and Angels shall for aye,
The blessed Name of GOD resound with Joy:
Joy everlasting, and a Joy that can
Not comprehended be by sensual Man.
Whilst thus with Joy implete, and Wonder too
Our happy Pilgrim does intently view
The glorious beauties of this sacred place;
He Is now disrobed of his poluted Case,
For no defilement, or polution
Can enter into new JERUSALEM.
A Body clear as Crystal, Light as Air,
Where the true Elements all mixed were
In a just harmony, he now indues,
His other body now no f^ces shows,
But swallowed up by a blessed Union
Is made more bright, and glorious than the Sun.
Arrayed thus the Aeternal Gate of Bliss
Straitway unto our Pilgrim opened is,
Through which he enters, to that sacred place
Where without Vails he sees GOD face to face.
Wonders of Wonders there he sees; which none
Beholds, til they (as he) approach the Throne,
That Throne of Glory, and Aeternal Bliss,
Where our thrice happy Pilgrim seated is.
Thus ends his Journey, here for ever blessed
He does implete with Joys, and Blisses rest.
And here I too should end, I do confess
With admiration of his happiness,
And with Addresses to Heaven's Majesty
That my poor Soul at last enthroned might be,
And that she might for ever blessed move,
In Joys, and Blisses in the Sphere of LOVE;
But that my thinks I see your noting eye
That Clouded Glory over this Orb does spy,
And speaking in its silent Language, now
The meaning of it me commands to show.
That represents GOD past the reach of Creature,
Beyond the Forms of the Eternal Nature;
GOD in himself: GOD in the Abstract; where
We may say what He is not; but we dare
Not say here what He is: for neither He
Can Good, or evil, or Light, or Darkness be,
Nor this, nor that here in this place; nor Can
Nor ought to be searched into by Man
Here as a Nothing He to us does seem,
Nor Can Man further knowledge have on ^im.
Nor Man, or Angel a Commission has
To dive into this abstruce secret Place,
Therefore thine eyes withdraw, and be Content
To know GOD as He will, nor represent
Thou to thy mind, or in thy fantasy
An Image of the glorious Deity;
For never ought we Heaven's high Majesty
To Form or Figure whatsoever tie:
Therefore O man destroy all Images
Of God, that in thy fantasy shall rise,
This is the increated ENS of God,
And an immense unfathomable flood,
Where lest we loose our selves we shall withdraw,
Into this secret place no man ever saw.
Therefore O Reader I admonish thee
That thou no farther search what God may be,
For if thou do, distracted in the end,
Thou will confess, Man cannot GOD comprehend.
Withdraw thy Thoughts then, cease thouhere to pry
Into the secrets of the Deity;
GOD will not here be known; but yet he is,
And will be known, upon the Throne of bliss.
He will be known in NATURE increate,
His Wonders there Man ought to meditate.
Where He the Arcana's of Heaven's Majesty,
With eyes of Truth, and with true eyes may see.
O Reader therefore to the Orb ^f Love
Your eyes, and meditations now remove,
Where thou by constant Prayer may obtain
A sight of what here under Clouds remain,
And with clear eyes must see those things of worth,
Which by my Pen are darkly shadowed forth:
But yet accept my Labor and my Pains;
My Heart examine, not my duller strains
For if they any shall with Light befriend
I joy: for that of Writing is
THE END.
Deo soli Gloria Qui Nobis haec otia fecit.
