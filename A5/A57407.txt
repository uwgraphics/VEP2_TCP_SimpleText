Robin Hood and the Tanner.
Or, Robin Hood met with his Match: A merry and pleasant S^ng. Relating the
gallant and fierce Combat between Arthur Bland, a Tanner of Nottingham, and
Robin Hood the greeaest Archer in England.
Tune is, Robin Hood and the Stranger.

IN Nottingham there lives a jolly Tanner,
with a hey down down a down down,
his name is Arthur a Bland,
There is never a Squire in Nottingham-shire,
dare bid bold Arthur to stand.
With a long Pike-staff upon his shoulder,
with a hey, etc.
so well he can clear his way,
By two and by three he makes them to flee,
for he has no list to stay.
As he went forth on a Summers morning,
with a hey, etc.
in the Forest of merry Sherwood,
To view the red Deer that range here and there,
there met he with bold Robin Hood.
As soon as bold Robin he did him espy,
with a hey, etc
he thought some sport he would make,
Therefore out of hand he bid him to stand,
and thus to him he did speak.
Why, what art thou, thou bold fellow,
with a hey, etc.
that ranges so boldly here,
Insooth to be brief, thou look like a Thief,
that comes to steal the Kings Deer.
If thou be a Keeper in this Forest,
with a hey, etc.
the King puts me in trust,
To look to his Deer that range here and there,
therefore stay thee I must,
If thou be a keeper in this Forest,
with a hey, etc.
and have such a great command,
Then thou must have more partakers in store,
before thou make me to stand.
Nay, I have no more partakers in store,
with a hey, etc.
nor any that I do need.
But I have a Staff of another Oak-graff,
I know it will do the deed:
For thy sword and thy bow I care not a straw,
with a hey, etc.
nor all thy Arrows to boot,
If thou get a knock upon the bare scop,
thou can as well shite as shoot,
Speak cleanly, speak cleanly, said jolly Robin,
with a hey, etc.
and give better terms to me.
Else I Will thee correct for thy neglect,
and make thee more mannerly.
Marry gip with a winnion, quoth. Arthur a Bland,
with a hey, etc.
art thou such a goodly man?
I care not a fig for thy looking so big,
mend thou thy self where thou can.
Then Robin Hood he unbuckled his belt,
with a hey, etc.
and threw it upon the ground,
Says, I have a staff of another Oak graff,
that is both strong and sound
But let me measure, said jolly Robin,
with a hey, etc.
since thou will not yield to mine.
For I have a staff of another Oak-graff,
not half a foot longer than thine.
But let me measure, said jolly Robin,
with a hey, etc.
before we begin our fray,
For I Will not have mine no longer than thine,
for (...) will be counted foul play.
I pass not for length, bold Arthur replied,
with a hey, etc.
my staff is of Oak so free,
Eight foot and a half, it will knock down a Calf,
and I hope it will knock down thee.
Then Robin Hood could no longer forbear,
with a hey, etc.
he gave him such a knock,
Quickly and soon, the blood came down,
before it was ten a Clock.
Then Arthur soon recovered himself,
with a hey, etc.
and gave him such a knock on the crown,
That from every hair of bold Robins head
the blood came trickling down.
Then Robin Hood raved like a wild Boar,
with a hey, etc.
as soon as he saw his own blood,
Then Bland was in have, he laid on so fast
as though he had been stacking of wood.
And about, and about, and about they went,
with a hey, etc.
like two wild Boars in a chase,
Striving to aim each other to maim,
Leg, arm, or any place.
And knock for knock they lustily dealt,
with a hey, etc.
which held two hours and more,
That all the wood rang at every bang,
they plied their work so sore.
Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood,
with a hey, etc.
and let our Quarrel fall,
For here we may thrash our bones to mash,
and get no Coin at all:
And in the Forest of merry Sherwood,
with a hey, etc.
hereafter thou shall be free,
Gra-mercy for naught, my freedom I Have bought,
I may thank my good staff, and not thee.
What tradesman art thou, said jolly Robin,
with a hey, etc.
good fellow I prithee me show,
And also me tell, in what place thou do dwell,
for both these fain would I know.
I am a Tanner, bold Arthur replied,
with a hey, etc.
in Nottingham long have I wrought,
And if thou come there, I vow and do swear,
I will tann thy hide for naught:
God-a-mercy good fellow, said jolly Robin,
with a hey, etc.
since thou art so kind to me,
And if thou will tann my Hide for naught,
I will do as much for thee.
But if thou will forsake thy Tanners Trade,
with a hey, etc.
and live in the green woods with me,
My name is Robin Hood, I swear by the wood,
I will give thee both gold and fee:
If thou be Robin Hood, bold Arthur replied,
with a hey, etc.
as I think well thou art,
Then here is my hand, my name's Arthur Bland
we two will never part.
But tell me, O tell me, where is little John?
with a hey, etc.
of him fain would I hear,
For we are Allied by the Mothers side,
and he is my Kinsman near.
Then Robin Hood blew on his bugle horn,
with a hey, etc.
he blew both loud and shrill,
And quickly anon, appeared little John,
come tripping over the Hill.
O what is the matter, then said little John,
with a hey, etc.
Master I pray you me tell,
Why do you stand with your staff in your hand,
I fear all is not well,
O man I do stand, and he makes me to stand,
with a hey, etc.
the Tanner that stands thee beside,
He is a bonny blade, and master of his trade,
for soundly he has tanned my hide,
He is to be commended, then said little John,
with a hey, etc.
if such a feat he can do.
If he be so stout, we will have a bout,
and he shall tan my hide too.
Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood
with a hey, etc.
for as I do understand,
He is a Yeoman good, and of thy own blood,
for his name is Arthur a Bland.
Then little John threw his staff away,
with a hey, etc.
and as far as he could it sling,
And ran out of hand to Arthur a Bland,
and about his neck did cling.
With loving respect there was no neglect,
with a hey, etc.
they was neither nice nor coy,
Each other did face with a lovely grace,
and both did weep for joy.
Then Robin Hood took them both by the hand,
with a hey, etc.
and Danced about the Oak-tree,
For three merry men, and three merry men,
and three merry men we be.
And ever hereafter as long as we live,
with a hey, etc.
we three will be all as one,
The wood shall ring, and the old wife sing,
of Robin Hood, Arthur and John.
FINIS.
