A FULL VIEW OF THE Doctrines and Practices OF THE Ancient Church Relating to
the EUCHARIST.

Wholly different from those of The Present ROMAN CHURCH, And inconsistent with
the Belief of TRANSUBSTANTIATION.

BEING A sufficient Confutation of Consensus Veterum, Nubes Testium, and other
Late Collections of the Fathers, pretending the contrary.

Rectum est Index sui and Obliqui. LONDON, Printed for Richard Chiswell at the
Rose and Crown in St. Paul's Churchyard. MDCLXXXVIII.

A PREFACE to the READER.
THAT which is here offered to thy Perusal, was occasioned by some late
Pamphlets Succession of Church and Sacraments. Consensus Veterum. Nubes Testium.
, that appeared, much about the same time, in Print, pretending by a Heap of
Testimonies from the Fathers to prove, as in some other Doctrines, so
particularly in that of the Corporal Presence and Transubstantiation, That the
Ancient Church, and the present Roman, are at a good Agreement.

It is very hard for Us to believe this, and scarce credible that they
themselves did so, when we see so much Unsincerity in their Allegations; such
Deceit and contrived disguising the Sense of the Fathers, in their
Translations; such late, uncertain, and supposititious Writings cited by them,
under the Venerable Names of Ancient Authors: When the way that Procrustes
took, of stretching Limbs, or chopping them off, to make all agree to his Bed
who were to be laid in it, is used to make the Ancient and the Present Church
to agree, a Consent thus procured can occasion but a short and a sorry Triumph.
Yet those Performances have been cried up, and they are looked upon as
Storehouses and Repositories, whence any Champion of theirs who enters the
Lists, may be furnished from the Fathers, either with what is necessary for his
own Defense, or the assailing of an Adversary. The Representer, since that,
made great use of them, in a brisk Attaque he made upon the Dublin Letter, though
the Success, I believe, did not answer his Expectation. The Convert of Putney's
Performance (who in his Consensus Veterum made the largest Show of Fathers on
behalf of Transubstantiation) has had a particular Consideration given it, by
his worthy Answerer Veteres Vindicati.
: And so all the other Testimonies in the rest of them, that are of any seeming
strength and moment, have received Answers to them from other Hands;
particularly from the Learned Author of The Doctrine of the Trinity and
Transubstantiation compared, Part 1.

If any thing, after all, seems to be wanting on our Part, it is this; That as
our Adversaries have made a Show of Fathers (for I can give it no better name)
pretended to countenance their Doctrines of the Corporal Presence and
Transubstantiation; so we also ought to have our Collection of Testimonies from
the Ancients, made faithfully and impartially, wherein their true Sense in
these Matters may be clearly seen and viewed, and thereby their Dissent from
this Church appear plainly, in those things that either constitute this
Doctrine, or are necessary Consequents of it. And this is that which I have
undertaken in the following Papers; wherein as the Usefulness of the Design has
encouraged me to take some Pains, so I shall think them well bestowed, if the
Reader will bring an honest and unprejudiced Mind to the Perusal of them, and
suffer himself to be determined in his Opinions concerning this Controversy,
according to the Evidence of Truth here offered for his Conviction. If the
Differences (which the annexed Contents of the Chapters give an Account of) are
of such a Nature, and stand at such a wide Distance, that it is impossible ever
to bring Transubstantiation to shake Hands with them as Friends; and if the two
Churches, the Ancient and the Present Roman, are really divided and
disagreeing, as I pretend to have demonstrated, in those Points, it will then I
hope hereafter be ridiculous, to talk confidently of a Consent of Fathers, and
of a Cloud of Witnesses on their Side.

But if I am herein mistaken, I am so little tender of my Reputation, compared
with Truth, that I heartily desire to be confuted and made a Convert; for I am
conscious to my self of no false Fathers I have cited for true ones; of no
disguising or perverting their Sense, by an Ill Translation of their Words;
(which I have therefore set down in their own Language) of no imposing upon the
Reader a Sense of my own making, contrary to what I believe that they intended.

I have but one Request more to make to the unknown Author of a Book entitled,
Reason and Authority, etc. who mentioning the Defense of the Dublin Letter Page
119.
(for which I have some reason to be concerned) says, That the Authorities of
the Fathers there urged are, as he conceives, in the Sense of them, either
mistaken or misapplied, and that he shall endeavor to reconcile them to other
Expressions of the Fathers, and to (that which he calls) the Catholic Doctrine
of Transubstantiation. I humbly desire, when he is about this Reconciling Work,
and his Hand is in, that he would go on to reconcile also the Differences urged
in the following Papers. Which if he shall do to any purpose, I promise to
return the Complements he has passed upon that Defender with Interest, and to
alter my present Opinion of him, upon his Performances in that Book.

Farewell.
THE CONTENTS OF THE CHAPTERS.
BEING A Summary of the DIFFERENCES betwixt the FAITH and PRACTICES of the Two
Churches.
CHAP. I. The First Difference. The Roman Church asserts perpetual Miracles in
the Eucharist: The Ancient Church owns none but those of God's Grace, working
Changes in us, not in the Substance of the Elements. Page 1 CHAP. II. The
Second Difference. They differ in determining what that Thing is which Christ
calls My Body; which the Ancient Church says is Bread, but the Roman Church
denies it. Page 7 CHAP. III. The Third Difference. The Roman Church believes,
That Accidents subsist in the Eucharist without any Subject: This the Fathers
deny. Page 12 CHAP. IV, The Fourth Difference. The Roman Church uses the Word
Species, to signify those self-subsisting Accidents: the Fathers never take
Species in this Sense. Page 16 CHAP. V. The Fifth Difference. The Fathers
differ from this Church about the Properties of Bodies; as, 1. They assert,
That every organized Body, even that of Christ, is visible and palpable. Page
21 2. That every Body possesses a Place, and is commensurate to it, and cannot
be in more Places than one, nor be entire in one Part, nor exist after the
manner of a Spirit. All which Transubstantiation denies. Page 22 3. That it is
impossible for one to dwell in himself, or partake of ones self; this inferring
Penetration of Dimensions, and that a greater Body may be contained in a
lesser; which the Fathers deny. Page 29
CHAP. VI. The Sixth Difference. The Roman Church teaches us to disbelieve the
Report of our Senses, which tell us, That Bread and Wine remain in the
Eucharist: The Fathers urge this Evidence, even with relation to Christ's true
Body. Page 31 Object. The Fathers call upon us not to believe our Senses in the
Case of the Eucharist. Answ. 1. The Fathers appeal to our Senses in this Case.
Page 39 2. They call upon Men not to regard their Information, in Matters
wherein none question the Truth of their Information. ibid. 3. The true Reason
why the Fathers call us off from listening to our Senses, is, to make us regard
and attend to things beyond their Information. Page 40
A Place of S. Cyril of Jerusalem, and another of S. Chrysostom, explained.
Page 42
CHAP. VII. The Seventh Difference. When the Fathers call the Eucharist
Christ's Body and Blood, the Roman Church understands it of Christ's Natural
Body; but the Fathers mean it commonly of the Bread and Wine. Several
Observables from the Fathers, to explain and prove this; as, 1 Obs. They tell
us of their studiously concealing the Mysteries from some Persons. Page 44 2
Obs. The Fathers, in their manner of speaking concerning Christ's Body, point
at another thing than his Natural Body. Page 46 3 Obs. They speak of Christ's
Body with Terms of Restriction and Diminution. Page 48 4 Obs. They give us
Reasons why it is called Christ's Body, (which none do for calling things by
their Proper Names) from its Resemblance and Representation. Page 49 5 Obs.
What they call Christ's Body, they say is without Life or Sense. Page 51 6 Obs.
They speak of Divisions and Parts of it, not to be affirmed of his Natural
Body. Page 52 7 Obs. They speak of making Christ's Body, differently from the
Sense of the Roman Church. Page 54 They affirm, 1. That whatsoever is made, was
not before it was made. Page 55 2. That Bread is made his Body, and that it is
made of Bread and Wine Page 55, 56 They call it sometimes Mystical Bread,
sometimes Christ's Mystical Body. Page 57 8 Obs. They speak of Christ's Body as
sanctified and sacrificed in the Eucharist, which is only true of his Typical
Body. Page 58 The Natural Body of Christ cannot be sanctified nor sacrificed
properly. Page 59
CHAP. VIII. The Eighth Difference. When the Fathers mention a Change and
Conversion in the Eucharist, the Roman Church understands such a Change as
abolishes the Substance of Bread and Wine: The Fathers never understand it so.
Page 62 Several Assertions of the Fathers to explain this. 1 Assert. They
distinguish between the Conversion of a thing, and its abolishing. ibid. 2
Assert. When they speak of a Conversion into what was before, they suppose an
Accession and Augmentation of that into which the Change is made. Page 63 3
Assert. The Fathers use the same Terms of Conversion, Passing into, Becoming
another thing, etc. in other Cases besides that of the Eucharist, wherein all
confess no Change of Substances is made. Page 65 Some Axioms of the Fathers to
this purpose. ibid. Their Instances of such Changes given, in Nature, in
Regeneration, in Christ's Incarnation, our Resurrection, in Baptism, wherein
the Change, however expressed, can be only in Qualities. Page 65, 66, 67 4
Assert. The Fathers, by a Change in the Eucharist, mean either a Change into a
Sacrament, or that of Efficacy and Virtue, by infusing and adding Grace. Page
69, 70 5 Assert. They express as fully, and in the same mann^r, our substantial
Change into Christ's Body, as of the Bread into Christ's Body. Page 72
CHAP. IX. The Ninth Difference. The Roman Church asserts a substantial
Presence of Christ's Natural Body in the Eucharist, which the Fathers deny.
Page 74 Several Positions of the Fathers to this purpose. 1 Pos. The Fathers
look upon Christ's Body as absent from Earth since his Ascension; though in
another sense he is present still. ibid. 2 Pos. They distinguish the presence
of Christ's Body from the Sacrament of it, which they make to be a memorial of
him as gone away. Page 77, 78 3 Pos. Whatsoever presence of Christ the Fathers
speak of in the Eucharist, they acknowledge the same in Baptism, and as fully.
Page 79, 80 They speak of those Waters as turned into Blood, of our being
Baptized in Blood, and yet neither they, nor any else, dreamed of
Transubstantiation. Page 82 4 Pos. They so consider the presence of Christ's
Body in the Eucharist, as can no way agree to his glorified Body. Page 83 5
Pos. According to them, the Presence of Christ's Body to us now, is a presence
to our Faith, a presence of Union, Efficacy and Grace. Page 85 What foul play
the Romanists have used with an Author that denied this. Page 90 An Account of
a late Learned Dissertation concerning Christ's Body and Blood, occasioned by a
doubt proposed to S. Austin. Page 91
CHAP. X. The Tenth Difference. The Fathers assert positively, that the
substance of Bread and Wine remain after Consecration, which the R. Church
denies. Page 93 Proved by their asserting, that Christ offered the same
oblation with Melchisedek. Page 101 Fraction in the Eucharist can only agree to
the Bread. Page 103
CHAP. XI. The Eleventh Difference. The Fathers make the Bread and Wine to be
the Sacrament, Sign, Figure, Type, Antitype, Image, etc. of Christ's Body and
Blood, which Transubstantiation contradicts. Page 105 Instances of the
particulars. Their calling it a Sacrament. ibid. Signs. 106. Types. 107.
Antitypes. ibid. A Figure. 108. Image. 110. Further Remarks of the Fathers
confirming the Argument, as 1 Remark. They say an Image, Figure, etc. cannot be
the thing it self. Page 111 2 Rem. That an Image, Type, etc. must visibly
demonstrate that, of which it is an Image, Type, etc. Page 112 3 Rem. They make
the Elements to be the Signs, Symbols, etc. of Christ as absent. Page 113 Some
Passages out of the old Liturgy in Bertram's time. Page 114 The Doctrine of the
Christians of St. Thomas in the East Indies, confirming the same. Page 115
CHAP. XII. The Twelfth Difference. The Fathers assert that Christ's Body is not
eaten Corporally and Carnally, but only spiritually. Whereas the Romans Church
teaches a Corporal Eating of Christ's Body. Page 116 Berengarius's Recantation
supposes this in the most literal sense. ibid. Though this sense was opposed
afterward. 117. Yet all Romans agree that Christ's Natural Body is taken into
ours. 118. How long they assert it makes its stay there. ibid. Horrid Cases how
resolved. 119. What the Fathers call understanding things Carnally. 120. That
they opposed the literal and carnal eating of Christ's Body. Page 121, 122,
123. Considerations proving they did not so understand it. 1 Consid. They say
we partake of Christ's Body in Baptism, which can be only spiritually. Page 125
2 Consid. They distinguish eating Christ's true Body from the Sacramental. Page
126 3 Consid. They assert, that the Fathers under the Old Test. did eat the
same spiritual meat with us, because they ate it by Faith. Page 127 4 Consid.
They represent Christ's Body as dead, and that so it must be taken: Ergo
spiritually. Page 128 Two remarkable sayings of S. Austin to prove all this.
Page 130
CHAP. XIII. The Thirteenth Difference. The Fathers assert, that the Faithful
only eat Christ's Body and drink his Blood, not the wicked: the To. Church
extends it to both. Page 131 The Church of Rome will have not only the wicked
but bruit Creatures to eat it. Page 132 The Cautions of the Mass suppose this.
ibid. The Fathers will not allow the wicked to partake of Christ's Body. Page
133 Two remarkable Testimonies of St. Austin. Page 136
CHAP. XIV. The Fourteenth Difference. The different practices and usages of
the two Churches, argue their different opinions about the Eucharist. Page 137
Eight Instances of their differing practices given. 1 Instance. The Ancient
Church excluded Catechumens Penitents, etc. from being present at the
Mysteries, enjoining all present to communicate. ibid. In the To. Chapter any may
be Spectators, though none receive but the Priest. Page 139 2 Inst. The old
practice was to give the Communion in both kinds. Page 140 Transubstantiation
made this practice cease. 141. New devices for security against profaning
Christ's Blood. Page 142 No reason why the Fathers have not been as cautious in
this as the To. Church, but their different belief. Page 143 3 Inst. The
Elevation of the Host that all may adore it, the Roman practice. Page 145 This
not used in the first Ages at all; when used afterward, not for Adoration.
Page 145, 146 4. Inst. The Romans Church allows not the people to receive the
Sacrament with their Hands, but all is put by the Priest into their Mouths,
contrary to the Ancient Practice. Page 147 5 Inst. The Anc. Church used Glass
Cups for the Wine; which would be criminal now. Page 148 6 Inst. They mixed of
old the Consecr. Wine with Ink, which would now be abhorred. Page 149 7 Inst.
In the Reservation of the Eucharist: Three differences herein considered. 1
Difference. The Anc. Church took no care to reserve what was not received in
the Eucharist: but the To. Church reserves all. 151, etc. 2 Differ. What had
been publicly received, the Anc. Church allowed liberty to reserve privately.
156. The present Chapter in no case allows such private reservation. 157. 3.
Differ. They put what was so reserved to such uses of old, as the To. Church
would think profane. Page 157, 158, etc. 8 Inst. The infinite sollicitous
caution to prevent accidents in the administration of the Sacrament; their
frights and strange expiations when they happen, all unknown, and strangers to
the Ancient Church. 160, etc. Which is proved positively, from the continued
practice of Communicating Infants, till Transubstantiation abolished it. Page
165 This still a practice in the Eastern Churches, that submit not to the Roman
Church. Page 167
CHAP. XV. The Fifteenth Difference. About their Prayers in two particulars. 1.
That the old Prayers in the Canon of the Mass, agree not with the Faith of the
now To. Church. Page 168 2. That their New Prayers to the Sacrament have no
Example in the Anc. Church. Page 175
CHAP. XVI. The Sixteenth Difference. That our ancient Saxon Church differed
from the present Romans Church in the Article of the corporal presence. Page 182,
etc. The Saxon Easter-Sermon produced as a Testimony against them. Page 183,
184, etc. Two Epistles of Elfric the Abbot, declare against that Doctrine. Page
187, 188. A Remarkable Testimony also of Rabanus Archbishop of Mentz alleged.
Page 189
CHAP. XVII. The Conclusion of the whole. Showing, that Heathens and Jews
reproached not the Ancient Christians about the Eucharist. 191.
Transubstantiation occasioned new Calumnies from both. 194. The Jew's
Conversion seems to be hopeless, whilst this is believed by them to be the
common Faith of Christians. 195. That the Jews have better explained Christ's
words of Institution; agreed better with the Ancient Church in understanding
the Sacrament in a figurative sense; and have confuted Transubstantiation by
unanswerable Arguments, proved by Instances, from p. 196. to the end.
Faults Escaped.

CHAP. I. The First Difference. The Church of Rome is forced to assert a
continued Series of Miracles to justify her Doctrine of Transubstantiation.
But the Fathers never mention any Miracles in the Eucharist, save only the
Effects of God's powerful Grace, working great Changes in us, and advancing the
Elements in the use of them thereunto, without changing their Nature and
Substance.
TO give the Reader a View of what Wonders are to be believed, according to
what the Trent Council has decreed concerning Transubstantiation, we need go no
further than to the Trent Catechism Ad Parccho^s, part. 2. number. 25.
, which tells us, there are three most wonderful things, which the Catholic
Faith without any doubting, believes and confesses are effected in this
Sacrament, by the Words of Consecration.

1. That the true Body of Christ, that same Body which was born of the Virgin,
and sits at the Right Hand of the Father, is contained in this Sacrament.

2. That no Substance of the Elements remains in it, though nothing may seem more
strange and remote from our Senses.

3. What is easily collected from both, That the Accidents, which are seen with
our Eyes, or are perceived by our other Senses, are without any Subject (in
which they subsist) in a strange manner, not to be explained. So that all the
Accidents of Bread and Wine may be seen, which yet inhere in no Substance, but
subsist by themselves, since the Substance of the Bread and Wine are so changed
into the very Body and Blood of our Lord, that the Substance of Bread and Wine
cease wholly to be.

But others of the Romish Writers have made a larger and more particular
Enumeration of the Miracles wrought in the Eucharist, which no Created Power
can effect, but God's Omnipotency alone. I Will give them in the Words of the
Jesuit Pererius In Joan. c. 6. Disp. 16. number. 48.
, who reckons these Nine distinct Miracles.

1. The same Christ remaining in Heaven, not departing thence, and without any
local mutation, is really and corporally in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

2. Nor is he thus there only in one consecrated Host, but is together in all
Hosts consecrated throughout the whole Earth.

3. Though the Body of Christ in the Sacrament has all its Quantity and Color,
and other sensible Qualities; yet as it is in the Sacrament, it is neither
there visibly nor quantitatively Quantum ad situm, and extensionem ejus ad
locum.
as to its situs, and extension unto Place.

4. Though the Body of Christ be in it self greater than a Consecrated Host, yet
according to the (Esse) Being it has there, it is whole in that Host; nor only
whole in the whole consecrated Host, but also whole in every part thereof.

5. If those Accidents of the Consecrated Host be corrupted, and it should
happen that of them Worms or any other Animal be generated, there is a great
Miracle in their Generation: For either the Materia prima is created anew, out
of which the substantial Form of those Animals is produced, as many Divines now
think; or, according to S. Thomas, which seems to be a greater Miracle, The
Quantity that was of the Consecrated Host, supplies the place of the Materia
prima, and in it is produced the substantial Form of those Animals which are
generated from thence.

6. The very Conversion of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Christ,
which is properly called by Divines Transubstantiation, is a great Miracle; for
such a Transmutation is found in no other thing, and is besides all the Order
and Course of Nature, and can be made by no Created Power, but by God's
Omnipotency alone.

7. The Manner by which such Transubstantiation is made, is not without a
Miracle; for it is made by the Words of Consecration, pronounced rightly, and,
as it ought, by a Priest. Therefore, as naturally supposing the last
disposition in Matter to produce the Form of Fire, the Form of Fire is
infallibly produced in that Matter: So the Words of Consecration being
pronounced by the Priest, Christ himself is infallibly in that Consecrated Host.

8. After Consecration, the whole Substance of Bread and Wine ceasing to be,
yet their Accidents do not cease, but remain: Neither do they remain inhering
in any other Subject, but (per se existunt) exist by themselves, which is truly
besides and above the Nature of Accidents, whose esse (as the Schools say) is
inesse, because they can neither be produced nor remain naturally without a
Subject.

9. Lastly, Those Accidents of the Consecrated Host, though without the Substance
of Bread and Wine, yet have the same natural Virtue which Bread and Wine had
before Consecration; viz. the Virtue of nourishing, increasing, and
strengthening the Body of the Person that receives it; when yet Nutrition is
made by conversion of the Substance of the Food into the Substance of the
Living Creature.

By reason of which Miracles (he says) the Church sings thus in the Hymn for
Corpus-Christi day.

Quod non capis, Quod non vides,
Animosa firmat fides, praeter rerum ordinem:
Etsi sensus deficit,
Ad firmandum cor sincerum
Sola fides sufficit:
Praestat fides supplementum sensuum defectui.
That is, What never yet was understood,
Nor ever seen by any Creature,
A confident Belief makes good,
Though cross to all the Laws of Nature.
Though Sense will not be brought t'allow it,
A Heart sincere may be secure,
And, waving all its Scruples, sure,
Since Faith alone's enough to do it;
For Faith supplies the Senses want,
And makes good Measure, where that is scant.


As for the Fathers, they are so far from consenting to this heap of Miracles
in the Eucharist, that we have reason to think, as to some of them, they never
entered into their thoughts, nor never troubled themselves about them; and, for
the most of them, though they are direct Consequences of Transubstantiation, yet
they are opposed and contradicted by the Fathers, as shall be shown in
Particulars afterward: Here it shall suffice to say in general, That the
Fathers give us this as a Character of the old Heretics, to urge God's
Omnipotency to countenance and give a color to their Figments and absurd
Opinions. Thus Gr. Nazianzen says of the Apollinarians, (...). Orat. 51.
That being pressed with these Reasonings, they fly to this, That to God it is
possible. And Tertullian, when Praxeas also urged God's Omnipotency, gives this
excellent Contr. Praxeam, c. 10. Si tam abrupte in praesumptionibus nostris hac
sententia utamur, quidvis de Deo confingere poterimus; quasi fecerit, quia
facere potuerit. Non autem quia omnia potest facere, ideo credendum est illum
fecisse, etiam quod non fecerit; sed an fecerit, requirendum.
Answer to him. If we may so abruptly use this Sentence, ( viz. That to God all
things are easy) in our Presumptions, we may then feign any thing we please of
God; as if he had done a thing, because he was able to do it. But because (God)
can do all things, we are not to believe he has done that which he has not
done; but we are to inquire, whether he has done it or no.

Thus Gr. Nyssen Gr. Nyssen in Hexaemeron. (...).
asserts, That the Will of God is the Measure of his Power. And Clemens of
Alexandria Stromat. l. 4. prope finem. (...).
, That God who is Omnipotent, will effect nothing that is absurd. And Origin L.
5. contr. Cel^. (...).
, When we say, That God can do all things, we know how to understand all
things, not of such things as cannot exist, and are unintelligible.

Obj. If any object, That the Fathers often bring in Instances of Gods
miraculous Power (as St. Ambrose does in the Red Sea and the River Jordan, and
in the miraculous Conception of our Savior, etc.) to create Faith in Men as to
the great Change that is wrought in the Eucharist.

Ans. I answer, True indeed: But then it is to be remembered, (what shall
hereafter be more fully declared) that the Change there is not terminated upon
the Substance of the Elements, nor is God's Power shown upon them, to alter
their Nature from what they were before, so as to destroy them; but it is an
addition of Grace to their Nature, and an advancement of them to produce
wonderful Effects upon us in the use of them. So that now the Element of Water
in Baptism is no more a common thing, but is employed by God to wash away our
Sins, to cleanse our Souls, and to regenerate and renew us: And in the
Eucharist the Bread and Wine, which in themselves are the Food of our Bodies,
are advanced to be a Means to communicate the Body and Blood of Christ to us,
for the nourishing and refreshing our Souls, and to make us Partakers of the
saving Effects of his Death and Passion; which are only Miracles of God's
Grace. And the Fathers urge the forementioned Miracles in Nature, to assure us
of these Wonders of Divine Grace. And this they do not only in the case of the
Eucharist, but of Baptism also; where yet none assert any Conversion of the
Substance of Water into any other thing. Thus S. Ambrose De in qui initiantur,
c. 9. ad finem. Si ergo superveniens Spiritus S. in Virginem conceptionem
operatus esf, and generationis munus implevit: Non utique dubitandum est, quod
superveniens in fontem, vel super eum qui baptismum consequitur, veritatem
regenerationis operetur.
: Mary conceived by the Holy Ghost, without the intervention of any Man, as S.
Matthew tells us; She was found with Child of the Holy Ghost. If then the Holy
Spirit coming upon the Virgin made her to conceive, etc. we need not question
but that the same Spirit coming upon the Water of Baptism, or on him that is
baptized, does produce true Regeneration. And P. Leo Mag. De Nativit. Dom. Ser.
4. Christus dedit aquae, quod dedit-Matri: Virtus enim Altissimi and obumbratio
Spiritus S. quae fecit ut Maria pareret Salvatorem, eadem facit ut regeneret
unda credentem.
Christ gave to the Water, what he gave to his Mother; for the Power of the
most High, and the Overshadowing of the H. Spirit, which caused Mary to bring
forth our Savior, the same causes the Water to regenerate a Believer.
Excepting therefore these Wonders of God's Grace, the Fathers knew no other
Miracles in the Sacraments; and these Wonders are common to both the
Sacraments, and not peculiar to one of them only.

This even Card. Cajetan In 3. part. q. 75. art. 1. Non est disputandum de
divina potentia, ubi de Sacramentis tractatur. Ibid. art. 2. Stultum est ponere
in hoc argumento, quicquid Deus potest facere.
was so sensible of, that he tells us, We must not dispute concerning God's
Power when we treat of Sacraments. And again, It is a fcolish thing to assert
in this Argument, whatsoever God can do.

He was not ignorant of what S. Austin had said long before Lib. 3. de Trin. c.
10. Quia haec hominibus nota sunt, quia per homines fiunt, honorem tanquam
religiosa possunt habere, stuporem tanquam mira non possunt.
, who speaking of Signs taken to signify other things, and instancing in the
Bread taken and consumed in the Sacrament, adds, But because these things are
known to men, as being made by men, they may have Honor given them for their
relation to Religion; but cannot raise Astonishment, as Miracles or Wonders.
Which he could never have said, if he had believed the Wonders and Miracles of
Transubstantiation.

I Will conclude this Head with another Saying of his Lib. 3. cont. Julian. c. 3.
Haec sunt sententiarum portenta vestrarum, haec inopinata mysteria Dogmatum
novorum, haec paradoxa Pelagianorum haereticorum mirabiliora quam Stoicorum
Philosophorum. -- Mira sunt quae dicitis, nova sunt quae dicitis, falsa sunt
quae dicitis. Mira stupemus, nova cavemus, falsa convincimus.
, which may be as well applied to the absurd Paradoxes and Miracles which the
Roman Church advances in this Case of the Eucharist, as ever it was to those he
there confutes about Baptism. These are the Prodigies of your Opinions; these
are the uncouth Mysteries of New Dogma's; these are the Paradoxes of Pelagian
Heretics, more wonderful than those of the Stoic Philosophers. -- The things
you say are Wonderful, the things you say are New, the things you say are
False. We are amazed at your Wonders, we are cautious against your Novelties,
and we confute your Falsities.

But this Difference being more general, we go on to more particular ones.

CHAP. II. The Second Difference. The Church of Rome differs from the Fathers,
in determining what that thing is which Christ calls MY BODY.
THE Trent Catechism Ad Paroch part. 2.37.. Haec vero. Si panis substantia
remaneret, nullo modo dici videretur, Hoc est Corpus meum.
, though it does not determine what the word [THIS] refers to, (only telling us,
that it must demonstrate the whole Substance of the thing present) yet it
expressly denies, that it refers to the Substance of Bread; for it adds, If the
Substance of Bread remained, it seems no way possible to be said that, THIS IS
MY BODY. So Bellarmine confesses De Euchar. l. 1. c. 1. sec. Nonus.
, that this Proposition, This Bread is my Body, must be taken figuratively,
that the Bread is the Body of Christ by way of signification, or else it is
plainly absurd and impossible. And he acknowledges Ib. lib. 2. cap. 9..
Observandum.
, that this Proposition, The Wine is the Lord's Blood, teaches, that Wine is
Blood by similitude and likeness. And elsewhere Lib. 3. cap. 19.
, It cannot be a true Proposition, in which the Subject is supposed to be
Bread, and the Predicate the Body of Christ; for Bread and Christ's Body are
res diversissimae, things most different. And a little after, If we might
affirm disparata de disparatis, different things of one another, you might as
well affirm and say, that something is nothing, and nothing something; that
Light is Darkness, and Darkness Light; that Christ is Belial, and Belial
Christ; neither does our Faith oblige us to defend those things that evidently
imply a Contradiction.

So also Vasquez Disp. 180. cap. 9. n. 91. Si pronomen; Hoc in illis verbis
demonstraret panem, fatemur etiam fore, ut nulla conversio virtute illorum
^^eri possit, quia panis, de quo enunciatur, manner debet.
, If the Pronoun [THIS] in Christ's Words pointed at the Bread, then we confess
it would follow, that no Conversion could be made by virtue of these Words,
because the Bread, of which it is affirmed (sc. that it is Christ's Body) ought
to remain.

Now that which the present Roman Church dare not affirm, because if it be
taken properly, it is untrue, absurd, impossible, as implying a Contradiction,
we shall now show that the Fathers plainly affirm it, who yet could not be
ignorant of this Absurdity. From whence it necessarily follows, that they took
the whole words [THIS IS MY BODY] figuratively, as the Protestants do, since
they cannot be taken otherwise, if Bread be affirmed to be Christ's Body, as
the Romanists confess. Now that the Fathers affirmed that Bread is Christ's
Body, is certain by these following Testimonies.

S. Irenaeus Adv. Haeres. l. 5. c. 2. (...).
. Our Lord confessed the Cup which is of the Creature to be his Blood; and the
Bread which is of the Creature, he confirmed it to be his Body.

Clement of Alexandria Paedag. lib. 2. c. 2. (...).
. Our Lord blessed the Wine, saying, Take, drink, this is my Blood, the Blood
of the Grape. For the Holy River of Gladness (so he calls the Wine) does
allegorically signify the Word ( i. e. the Blood of the Word) shed for many
for the remission of Sins.

Tertullian Adv. Judaeos, c. 21. Panem corpus suum appellans.
. Calling Bread his Body. Speaking of Christ.

And against Marcion Idem adv. Marcion. lib. 3. cap. 19. Panem corpus suum
appellans, ut and hinc eum intelligas corporis sui figuram pani dedisse, etc.
he says the same; Calling Bread his Body, that thou may know that he gave to
Bread the Figure of his Body, etc.

And in the next Book Lib. 4. advers. Marc. c. 40. Acceptum panem and
distributum Discipulis, corpus suum illum fecit, Hoc est corpus meum dicendo,
id est, figura corporis mei.
. The Bread that he took and distributed to his Disciples, he made it his Body,
saying, This is my Body, that is, the Figure of my Body.

S. Cyprian Epist. 76. ad Magnum. Quando Dominus corpus suum panem vocat de
multorum granorum adunatione congestum, etc.
, When our Lord called the Bread, which is made up of many united Grains, his
Body, etc.

Tatianus Syrus Harmon. in Bibl. Patrum, 1624. Tom. 7. Accepto pane, deinde
vini calice, corpus esse suum ac sanguinem testatus, etc.
. Christ taking the Bread, and after that the Cup of Wine, testified that they
were his Body and Blood, etc.

Origin Hom. 35. in Matthew. Pa^^ isce quem Dominus corpus suum esse fatetur.
. That Bread which our Lord confessed to be his Body.

Eusebius Demonstr. Evang. lib. 8. (...).
. Christ appointed them (or delivered to them) to make use of Bread for a
Symbol of his Body.

Cyril of Jerusalem Catech. Mystag. 4. (...);
. When Christ affirms, and says of the Bread, This is my Body, who will dare to
doubt further of it?

S. Jerome Epist, ad Hedibiam, Nos audiamus panem quem fregit Dominus, deditque
discipulis suis, esse corpus Salvatoris, etc.
. Let us hear, that the Bread which our Lord brake and gave to his Disciples,
is the Body of our Savior. Which he explains further elsewhere Comm. in 26.
Matt. Quomodo in praefiguratione ejus Melchisedek -- pan^m and vinum offerens
fecerat, ipse quoque veritatem sui corporis and sanguinis repraesentaret.
, That as Melchisedek prefiguring him had done, when he offered Bread and Wine,
so he also represented the Truth of his Body and Blood.

S. Chrysostom In 1 Cor. Hom. 24. (...).
. What is the Bread? The Body of Christ. What do they become that receive it?
The Body of Christ. Not many Bodies, but one Body.

S. Austin Sermon. ad recens. baptizat. apud Fulgentium, Bedam, etc. Quod fides
vestra postulat instruenda, Panis est corpus Christi, Calix sanguis Christi.
What your Faith is to be instructed in, is, That the Bread is the Body of
Christ, and the Cup the Blood of Christ.

And elsewhere Contr. Adimantum, c. 12. Non dubitavit Dominus dicere, Hoc est
corpus meum, cum daret signum corporis sui.
Our Lord doubted not to affirm, This is my Body, when he gave the Sign of his
Body.

Gaudentius In Exodus tract. 2. Cum panem consecratum and vinum discipulis suis
porrigeret Dominus, sic ait, Hoc est corpus meam.
. When our Lord reached the Consecrated Bread and Wine to his Disciples, he
said thus, This is my Body.

Cyril of Alexandria In J^an. 20.26, 27. (...), etc.
. Christ, when he had broken the Bread, as it is written, distributed it,
saying, This is my Body.

Theophilus Antioch. Com. in Matthew. 26.
, or the Author under his Name upon the Gospels, soeaks just S. Cyprian's
Language. When Jesus said, This is my Body, he called the Bread his Body, which
is made up of many Grains, by which he would represent the People, etc.

Theodoret In Dialog. 1. (...), etc.
. In the delivery of the Mysteries, he called the Bread his Body, and that
which is mixed (Wine and Water in the Cup) Blood. -- And afterward, He
honored the visible Symbols with the appellation of his Body and Blood, etc.

Facundus Hermian. In Defens. 3. capit. lib. 9. c. ult. Ipse Dominus benedictum
panem and calicem quem discipulis tradidit, corpus and sanguinem suum vocavit.
. Our Lord himself called the Blessed Bread and Cup which he delivered to the
Disciples, his Body and Blood.

Maxentius Dialog. 2. c. 13. Sed and panis ille quem universa Ecclesia in
memoriam Dominicae passionis participat, corpus ejus.
speaking of the Church, that is called Christ's Body, adds, Also the Bread
which the whole Church partakes of, in memory of the Lord's Passion, is his
Body.

Isidore of Sevil Originum lib. 6. cap. 19. Hoc, eo jubente, corpus Christi and
sanguinem dicimus, quod dum fit ex fructibus terrae, sanctificatur and fit
Sacramentum, operante invisibiliter Spiritu Dei.
says, We call this, by his Command, the Body and Blood of Christ, which being
made of the Fruits of the Earth, is sanctified and made a Sacrament, by the
invisible Operation of the Spirit of God.

Bid Comm. in Marc. 14. -- Quia panis corpus confirmat, vinum vero sanguinem
operatur in carne, hic ad corpus Christi mystice, illud refertur ad sanguinem.
. Christ said to his Disciples, This is my Body, etc. because Bread strengthens
the Body, and Wine produces Blood in the Flesh; This relates mystically to
Christ's Body, and That to his Blood.

The Seventh General Council at Constantinople Extat in Conc. Nicen. 2. Art. 6.
(...).
, after reciting the Words of the Institution, This is my Body, after his
taking, and blessing, and breaking it, adds, Behold the Image of his
Life-giving Body made preciously and honorably. And afterward, It pleased him
that the Bread of the Sacrament, being the true Figure of his natural Flesh,
should be made a Divine Body, being sanctified by the coming of the Holy Ghost
upon it, etc.

Druthmarus Comm. in Matthew. 26. Hoc est corpus meum; id est, in Sacramento --
Quia inter omnes vitae alimonias cibus panis and vinum valent ad confirmandam
and recreandam nostram infirmitatem, recte per haec duo mysterium sui
Sacramenti confirmare placuit. Vinum namque and laetificat and sanguinem auget;
and idcirco non inconvenienter sanguis Christi per hoc figuratur, quoniam
quicquid nobis ab ipso venit laetificat laetitia vera, and anget omne bonum
nostrum.
. This is my Body, that is to say, in a Sacrament -- Because among all things
that are the Food of Life, Bread and Wine serve to strengthen and refresh our
Weaknesses, it is with great Reason that he would in these two things establish
the Mystery of his Sacrament. For Wine both chears us and increases Blood, and
therefore very fitly the Blood of Christ is figured by it; because whatsoever
comes to us from him, chears us with true Joy, and increases all Good in us.

Rabanus Maurus Comm. in Matthew. 26. Quia panis confirmat corpus, ideo corpus
ille Christi congruenter nuncupatur, vinum autem quia sanguinem operatur in
carne, ideo ad sanguinem Christi refertur.
explaining the Words of Institution, says, Because Bread strengthens the Body,
therefore it is fitly called the Body of Christ; and Wine, because it produces
Blood in our Flesh, is therefore referred to the Blood of Christ.

In the Aethiopick Churches Ludolphi Aethiop. Hist. l. 3. c. 5 n. 56. Hic panis
est corpus meum.
they use this Phrase, (which the Church of Rome is so shy of) This Bread is my
Body.

Bertram De Corp. and Sang. Dom. page 40. late Eng. and Lat. Translation. Non
putamus ullum fidelium dubitare, panem illum fuisse corpus Christi effectum,
quod Discipulis donans dicit, Hoc est corpus meum, etc.
. I am confident, no Christian doubts, but that Bread was made the Body of
Christ, which he gave to his Discples, saying, This is my Body, etc. And he
there shows, that this is made by the same change, whereby the Manna and the
Water of the Rock in the Wilderness were turned into his Body and Blood.

To conclude this Head; It is plain, that there is a general Consent of Fathers
on the Protestant Side in this Particular, That the Bread and Wine are Christ's
Body and Blood. And it is the more remarkable, because they give us this Sense,
when they are explaining Christ's Words, and in their Commentaries upon the
Gospels where the Words of Institution are recorded.

CHAP. III. The Third Difference. The Church of Rome believes, That Accidents
in the Eucharist subsist without a Subject; but the Fathers say the contrary,
That Accidents cannot subsist without a Subject, and yet never except the
Eucharist.
THe Catechism of the Trent Council Ad Parochos, part. 2. de Euchar. n. 25.
says, That the Accidents which are either seen with cur Eyes, or perceived by
our other Senses, are without any Subject, by a wonderful manner, and such as
cannot be explained. They grant that we may see all the Accidents of Bread and
Wine, but that they inhere in no Substance, but sustain themselves. -- And
afterward Ibid. n. 44.. Tertium restat.
discourse thus: The Species of Bread and Wine subsist in this Sacrament,
without any Subject in which they are: For since the Body and Blood of Christ
is truly in this Sacrament, so that no Substance of Bread and Wine remains,
because those Accidents cannot be inherent in the Body and Blood of Christ, it
remains, that the Accidents sustain themselves, above all Order of Nature,
being upheld by nothing else besides. And this (they say) was the perpetual
constant Doctrine of the Catholic Church.

How false this Assertion is, we shall now show from the Testimonies of the
Fathers.

Irenaeus Lib. 2. c. 14. Non potest intelligi aqua sine humectatione, neque
ignis sine calore, neque lapis sine duritia. Unita enim sunt invicem haec;
alterum ab altero separari non potest, sed semper coexistere.
. We cannot understand Water without Moisture, nor Fire without Heat, nor a
Stone without Hardness. For these are united one to another, one cannot be
separated from the other, but must always coexist.

Athanasius Orat. 5. contra Arianos. (...).
, (or the Author against the Arians in his Works) asserts, That every Quality
is in a Substance.

Isidore Peleusiota Lib. 2. Epist 72. (...).
says, That Quality cannot be without Substance.

Methedius Apud Photium Codic. 232. (...).
. Quality cannot be separated, as to its Subsistence, from Matter. And a little
before he says, This is the most impossible of all things.

S. Basil Epist 43. (...).
If by your reasoning you can distinguish Figure from a Body, yet Nature admits
no such Difference, but one must be understood in conjunction with the other.

Greg. Nazianzen Orat. 37. (...).
proves the Holy Ghost not to be a Quality, because then it must be in a
Subject. For, says he, either it does subsist by it self, or is of the same
kind with those which are called Accidents, which are in another.

This would be ill reasoning, if Transubstantiation were true; for the Holy
Ghost might be a Quality, and yet be in no Subject, as well as the Color and
Taste of Bread may be in the Eucharist, without Bread or any other Substance in
which it is.

Gr. Nyssen De Opificio Homin. c. 24. (...).
affirms, That as that is not a Body to which Color, and Figure, and
Solidness, and Space, and Heaviness, and other Properties are wanting; so, as
he adds, where those aforesaid do concur, they produce a Bodily Subsistence.

S. Austin Soliloq. lib. 2. c. 12. Monstruosum enim and a veritate alienissimum
est, ut id quod non esset, nisi in ipso (sc. subjecto) esset, etiam, cum ipsum
non fuerit, posse esse.
. It is monstrous, and at the furthest distance from Truth, that what would not
be at all unless it were in a Subject, yet should be able to exist when the
Subject ceases to be. This is a Saying with a witness to confute
Transubstantiation, where there is the Appearance and Figure, Taste and Weight
of Bread, and yet no Substance of Bread is there. Again he says Ibid. cap 13.
Omne quod in subjecto est, si semper manet, ipsum etiam subjectum maneat semper
necesse est.
, Every thing that is in a Subject, and always remains, it is necessary that
the Subject also should always remain.

Again De Immortal. Anim. cap. 5. Mutato subjecto, omne quod in subjecto est
necessario mutari. Et cap. 8. Quod per se non est, si deseratur ab eo per quod
est, profecto non erit.
elsewhere. When the Subject is changed, every thing that is in the Subject is
necessarily changed. And again: That which exists not by it self, if it be
forsaken of that by which it exists, undoubtedly will not be at all.

Also in another place Epist. 57. ad Dardanum. Toll ipsa corpora qualitatibus
corporum, non erit ubi sint, and ideo necesse est ut non sint.
. Take away Bodies from their Qualities, and there will nothing remain where
(those Qualities) should be; and therefore it follows necessarily, that they
will not be at all.

Cyril of Alexandria In Joan. lib. 4. cap. 1. (...).
teaches the same copiously. He calls it Madness to affirm, That the Essence of
the Son consists in Subjection to the Father. For, says he, how can Subjection
be conceived to subsist by it self, without existing in any thing else? And
afterward: If there be no Subject, and nothing praeexists in which those
things are wont to be done, how can they exist by themselves, which are
understood and defined in the Order of Accidents?

And elsewhere he says Thesaur. assert. 31. (...).
, To be Unbegotten, is predicated of the Divine Essence, as inseparable from
it; just as Color is always predicated of every Body.

And in another place Ibid. assert. 16. (...), etc.
disputing about the Eternity of the Son, and how proceeding from the Father he
is not separated from him, he instances in Accidents that are inseparable from
their Subjects. We see, says he, Heat inseparably proceeding from Fire; but it
is the Fruit of the very Essence of Fire, proceeding inseparably from it; (...)
as also Splendour is the Fruit of Light. For Light cannot subsist without
Splendour, nor Fire without Heat; For what is begotten of them, does always
adhere to such Substances.

Again, in his Dialogues De Trinitate, Dial. 2. p. 451. (...).
of the Trinity, he asks, Whether Black and White, if they be not in their
Subjects, can subsist of themselves? And the Answer is, They cannot.

Claud. Mamertus De Statu Animae, l. 3. c. 3. In rebus corporeis subjectum est
corpus, and color corporis in subjecto: In incorporeis animus and disciplina,
quae i^a sibi nexa sunt, ut nec sine color corpus, nec sine disciplina
rationalis sit animus -- Utrum nam probare valeamus manner quod in subjecto
est, ipso intereunte subjecto?
. In corporeal things, the Body is the Subject, and the Color of the Body in
the Subject: In incorporeal matters, the Soul and Discipline are Instances;
which are so connected, that the Body cannot be without Color, nor the
Rational Soul without Discipline -- Can we ever prove, that what is in the
Subject abides, when the Subject it self perishes?

Isidore Hispal. Originum lib. 2. cap. 26. Quantitas, qualitas, and situs, sine
subjecto esse non possunt.
. Quantity, Quality, and Situation, can none of 'em be without a Subject.

Bertram Contra Graec. l. 2. c. 7. in Tom. 2. Spicilegii D. Acherii.
proves against the Greeks, That the Holy Ghost was not in Jesus Christ as in
his Subject; because, says he, the Holy Ghost is not an Accident that cannot
subsist without its Subject.

These Testimonies of the Fathers may suffice to show how they differ from the
Church of Rome, in this Point, of Accidents being without a Subject, which to
them is so necessary a Doctrine, that Transubstantiation cannot be believed
without it; and if the Fathers had believed Transubstantiation, it is
incredible that they should deny this Doctrine, without so much as once
excepting the Case of the Eucharist: None can imagine how their Memory and
Reflection should be so short, especially when (as we have heard) they form
their Arguments to prove the Eternity of the Son of God, and the Personality of
the Holy Ghost, from the inseparability of Accidents from their Subject. Nay,
one of them says Orat. 5. contra Arianos, inter Athanasii Opera.
, That if God himself had Accidents, they would exist in his Substance.

When therefore P. Innocent De Mist. Missae, l. 4. c. 11. Est enim hic color
and sapor and quantitas and qualitas, cum nihil alterutro sit coloratum aut
sapidum, quantum aut quale.
asserts, That in the Eucharist there is Color and Taste, and Quantity and
Quality, and yet nothing colored or tasteful, nothing of which Quantity or
Quality are Affections: This is plainly to confound the Nature of all things,
and to turn Accidents into Substances. So that if, for instance, the Host
should fall into the Mire, and contract Dirt and Filth, this Filth sticks in
nothing, or else Accidents are the Subject of it; for it is confessed on all
hands, That Christ's Body cannot be soiled or made filthy. Not to insist upon
the Nonsense of his Assertion, which is just as if one should talk of an
Eclipse without either Sun or Moon, or of an Horses Lameness without a Leg,
concerning which only Lameness can be affirmed.

CHAP. IV. The Fourth Difference. The Church of Rome has brought in the Word
SPECIES, to signify those Accidents without any Subject: But the Fathers never
take it in this Sense.
I Need only refer the Reader, for the first part of this Assertion, to the
Thirteenth Session of the Council of Trent, Can^n 2. and 3. where the Word
Species is so used: And to what we heard before out of their Catechism, of the
Species of Bread and Wine subsisting without any Subject in which they are.
Every one knows this is their Customary Word, to express Appearances of things
by, when nothing real is under them to support them

But now we shall see this to be a strange and foreign usage of this Word,
which the Fathers know nothing of in their Sense; but in stead of denoting
Accidents (by the Word Species) which are in no Subject, they use it commonly
for the Substance, the Nature, the Matter of a thing, the Subject it self that
appears: Not for Appearances without a Subject.

S. Ambrose often uses this Word Species, but never in the Sense of the
Romanists: For which take these Instances.

S. Ambrose says Sermon. 21. Dominum rogatum ad Nuptias aquae substantiam in vini
speciem commutasse.
, That at the Marriage (of Cana) our Lord being requested, did change the
Substance of Water into the Species of Wine. That is, not into the Appearance
of Wine, but into real Wine that he changed it.

And in another place Sermon. 22. Speciem magis necessariam Nuptiis praestitit.
, He provided for the Marriage a more necessary Species: i. e. Wine, more
agreeable to a Marriage Feast than Water.

In another Book Officior. lib. 2. cap. 28. Hic numerus captivorum, hic ordo
praestantior est quam species poculorum.
, speaking of Holy Vessels which he broke for the Redemption of Captives, he
says, This Number and Order of Captives far excels the Species of Cups. i.e.
all sorts of them.

Again elsewhere De iis qui initiant. cap. 9. Gravior est ferri species quam
aquarum liquor.
. The Species of Iron is heavier than the Liquor of Water: i. e. the Substance
of Iron.

S. Austin In Joan. tract. 11. Omnes in Moyse baptizati sunt in nube and in
mari. Si ergo figura maris tantum valuit, species baptismi quantum valebit?
. They were all baptized into Moses in the Cloud and in the Sea. If therefore
the Figure of the Sea availed so much, how much will the Species of Baptism
avail?

In another place Sermon. ad Infantes. Ut sit species visibilis panis, multa
grana in unum consperguntur.
. To make the visible Species of Bread, many Grains are mixed together into one.

Again Lib. 3. de Trinit. cap. 4. Quod cum per manus hominum ad illam visibilem
speciem perducitur, non sanctificatur ut sit tam magnum Sacramentum, nisi
operante invisibiliter Spiritu Dei, etc.
, speaking of the Bread in the Sacrament, he says, When by Men's Hands it is
brought to that visible Species ( i. e. to the Substance of Bread) it is not
sanctified so as to become so great a Sacrament, without the invisible
Operation of the Spirit of God.

So elsewhere In Joan. tract. 26. Omnes eundem spiritualem potum biberunt;
aliud illi, aliud nos; sed specie visibili quidem, tamen hoc idem significante
virtute spirituali.
. They all drank of the same spiritual Drink; they one thing, and we another;
but though another as to the visible Species, yet as to the Spiritual Virtue
signifying this same thing. Where the Visible Species, it is plain, denotes
Water to the Jews, and Wine to us, not the Accidents only.

And in another Tractate Tract. 45. in Joan. Videte, fide manente, signa
variata. Ibi petra Christus, nobis Christus quod in altari Dei ponitur; and
illi pro magno Sacramento ejusdem Christi biberunt aquam profluentem de petra,
nos quid bibamus norunt fideles: si speciem visibilem intendas, aliud est, si
intelligibilem significationem, eundem potum spiritualem biberunt.
to the same sense, speaking of the Jews. Behold the Signs are varied, Faith
remaining the same. To them the Rock was Christ; to us, that which is placed on
the Altar is Christ: They drank the Water flowing from the Rock, for a great
Sacrament of the same Christ; what we drink, the Faithful know. If you regard
the Visible Species, it is another thing; but if the intelligible
Signification, they drank the same spiritual Drink.

And so in another Book Lib. 3. de Trinit. cap. 10. Cum autem suscipitur,
aliquando in Angelo demonstratur, aliquando in ea Specie quae non est quod
Angelus, quamvis per Angelum disposita ministretur.
, speaking of things assumed to signify matters to us, he says, When it is
assumed, sometimes it is shown in an Angel, sometimes in that Species which is
not what an Angel is, though it is ordered and disposed by an Angel's Ministry.
And his next Instance of such things is, ipsum Corpus, a Body it self.

So Gaudentius In Exodus tract. 2. Recte etiam vini specie tum sanguis ejus
exprimitur, quia cum ipse in Evangelio dicit, Ego sum Vitis vera, satis
declarat sanguinem suum esse omne vinum quod in figura passionis ejus offertur.
. Also by the Species of Wine his Blood is then rightly expressed; for when he
says in the Gospel, I am the true Vine, he fully declares, That all the Wine
that is offered for a Figure of his Passion, is his Blood.

Arnobius jun. In Psalm. 104. Succurrit, non solum cis speciem frumenti, sed and
vini and olei administrans.
. Our Lord succors them, not only by affording them the Species of Corn, but
also of Wine and Oil. Where the Word Species, to be sure, relates to the
Substance and the thing it self, not to the Accidents of Corn, and Wine, and
Oil.

Sedulius Lib. 2. Operis Paschal.
speaking of the Offerings of the Wise Men that came to Christ, says, Ipsae
etiam ut possent Species ostendere Christum;
Aurea nascenti fuderunt munera Regi,
Thura dedere Deo, Myrrham tribuere Sepulcher.


That is, They point to Christ even by the Gifts they bring;
Gold they present unto him as a King,
Incense as God, Myrrh for his Burying.


The things they present are, you see, his Species.

Salvian's words are plain Lib. 1. de Gub. Dei. p. 21. Edit. Baluz. Add
medicatas aquas veldatas vel immutatas, Speciem servantes, Naturam relinquentes.
. Add, says he, those healed Waters either given or changed, which preserved
their Species, and relinquished their Nature. Here Species is taken for the
Substance remaining, and Nature for the Qualities of the Water that were
changed.

Walafridus Strabo De Rebus Eccles. cap. 16. Corporis and sanguinis sui
Sacramenta panis and vini substantia Discipulis tradidit -- Nihil ergo
congruentius his Speciebus ad significandam capitis and membrorum unitatem,
potuit inveniri.
showing how Christ in the Last Supper delivered to his Disciples the
Sacraments of his Body and Blood in the Substance of Bread and Wine, adds,
Nothing more agreeable than these Species could be found, to signify the Unity
of the Head and Members.

Rupertus Abbas De Offic. lib. 2. cap. 9. In illum in quo fides non est,
praeter visibiles Species panis and vini, nihil de Sacrificio pervenit.
. Nothing of the Sacrifice enters into him that has no Faith, besides the
visible Species of Bread and Wine. No one ever thought, but that the Wicked
partak'd as much of the outward Elements as the Faithful; but he says a little
before, That when the Priest distributes the Sacrifice to be eaten by the
Faithful, the Bread and Wine is consumed and passes away. Therefore by the
visible Species he means the Bread and Wine, which the Wicked only partake of.

It has been largely proved by Salmasius Simplicius Verinus de Transubst. p.
230, etc.
, That in the Civil Law and the Theodosian Code, the word Species is used for
things there spoke of; as, Species annonariae, for all sorts of Corn; Species
publicae, for Goods brought to the several Ports; Species vini, frumenti, olei,
for Wine, Corn, and Oil; and not the Accidents of them.

It is not to be expected that any thing should be cited out of Greek Authors,
whose this Word is not; and yet it is observable, That even among them the Word
(...), that answers to the Latin Word Species, is taken in the Sense of the
Latin Fathers, and not in that of the present Church of Rome. To give only two
Instances.

The Author under the Name of Dionysius the Areopagite Eccles. Hierarch. cap.
3. (...).
, speaking of Christ's Incarnation, uses the Phrase of Assuming our Species;
which his Scoliast, Maximus, thus explains; (...), that is, (...)
When he had assumed our Species or Nature; not merely an Appearance of our
Nature.

Theophylact In Marc. 14. (...).
. Because, says he, Bread and Wine are things familiar to us, and we could not
endure, but should abhor to see Flesh and Blood set before us; therefore
Christ, the Lover of Men, condescending to us, preserves the Species of Bread
and Wine, (that is, the Elements themselves) but he changes them into the
Vritue of his Flesh and Blood.

To conclude this Head, Bertram Lib. de Corp. and Sang. Christi. Secundum
Speciem visibilem, secundum visibilem Creaturam, and secundum creaturarum
substantiam.
, following the Sense of the Ancients, uses these Phrases indifferently;
according to the visible Species, and according to the visible Creature, or
according to the Substance of the Creatures. Which are Modes of Speech which
the present Roman Church will not allow of in the Eucharist: For they tell us
their plain Belief, what Species are, in a Sequence on Corpus-Christi day,
which explains it thus: Sub diversis Speciebus,
Signis tantum, and non rebus,
Latent res eximiae.


Admirable things lie hid under the different Species, which are only Signs,
and not Things.

CHAP. V. The Fifth Difference. The Fathers differ from the Roman Church, in
their Assertions about the Nature and Properties of Bodies.
EVery one knows what the Sentiments of the Roman Church are herein, and what
they must necessarily assert believing Transubstantiation: That a Body that is
Organical, as Christ's is, may be invisible and impalpable; commensurate to no
Space: That it may possess one Place, so as to be in more at the same time:
That it may be entire in one Part and in one Point, and may exist after the
manner of a Spirit.

See Bellarmine de Eucharist. lib. 1. cap. 2. reg. 3. and lib. 3. c. 7.

The Council of Trent says Sess. 13. cap. 3. Totus Christus and integer sub
specie panis, and sub qualibet ejus speciei part existit.
, Whole and entire Christ is in the Eucharist, under the Species of Bread, and
under every part of the Species of Bread.

I shall now show, That the Fathers assert quite contrary to all these Maxims
of the Roman Church, giving us a different Account of the Nature and Properties
of Bodies; and in the Particulars forenamed, make no difference betwixt
Christ's Body and ours.

1 Assertion. They assert, That every Organized Body, not excepting the Body of
Christ, is visible and palpable.
Tertullian De Resurrect. c. 35. Corpus hominis non aliud intelligam quam --
quod videtur, quod tenetur.
. I understand nothing by the Body of a Man, etc. but what is seen and felt.

Methodius Apud Photium Cod. 234. (...).
. God is Incorporeal, and therefore Invisible.

Eustathius Antioch. De Engastrimytho. (...).
. If he was Invisible, without doubt he was Incorporeal. Speaking of Samuel
raised at Endor.

Didymus Caten. in Joan. 4.24. (...).
. If a thing be Invisible, it presently follows, that it is Incorporeal.

Greg. Nazianzen Orat. 34. (...); -- (...); -- (...).
. If God be a Body, what kind of Body, and how? -- an impalpable and invisible
one? -- This is not the Nature of Bodies. And he cries out, ((...)) O strange
License! to imagine thus.

Greg. Nyssen De Opific. hom. cap. 24. (...), etc.
says, That is not a Body, that wants Color, Figure, Solidness, Space, Weight,
and the rest of its Attributes.

S. Austin De Verb. Domini, Ser. 60. Semper quidem Divinitate nobiscum est, sed
nisi corporaliter abiret a nobis, semper ejus corpus carnaliter videremus.
, speaking of our Lord, says, He is always with us by his Divinity; but if he
were not corporally absent from us, we should always carnally see his Body.

Ephrem Antioch. Apud Photium, Cod. 229. (...).
. No Man of any sense can say, That the Nature of that which is palpable and
impalpable, of that which is visible and that which is invisible, is the same.
Although the Valentinians in Eulogius Ibid. Cod. 230. (...).
say, That the Nature of that which is visible, and that which is invisible, is
the same. And so did the Manichees. Ibid.

Vigilius Lib. 4. contr. Eutych. Necesse erit ut caro, sicut and verbum; si
unius cum co est naturae, increata sit and invisibilis, etc. Sed carnem his
conditionibus subjacere impossible est.
, speaking of the Lord's Body, says, It is necessary the Flesh, as well as the
Word, if they be of one Nature, be uncreated and invisible -- But it is
impossible that Flesh should be the Subject of such Conditions.

Titus Bostrensis Contr. M^nich. l. 2. Omne quod sub aspectum cadit, cum sit
corpus, natura oppositum est inaspectabili and incorporeo, etc.
. Every thing that falls under our Sight, seeing it is a Body, is in Nature
opposite to that which is invisible and incorporeal.

Damascen De Fide Orth. lib. 1. c. 4. (...) -- (...);
. How can that be a Body, etc, which is impalpable and invisible?

Gregory the Great Moral. lib. 14. c. 33. Erit itaque subtilis, quia and
incorruptibilis; erit palpabilis, quia non amittet essentiam veracis naturae.
, speaking of a glorified Body, says, It will therefore be a subtle Body,
because it will be incorruptible; and it will be palpable, because it shall not
lose the Essence of its true Nature.

Cyril of Alex. in his Explication of the third Anathema of the Ephesine
Council Tom. 3 Council. Labbe. p. 817. (...).
. He is not a Stranger to that Body which he has united to himself, which we
say is capable to be felt, and to be seen.

In fine, The Church of Rome makes Christ's Body invisible though it be present;
the Fathers never make it so, but because it is absent.

So Ammonius Eaten. in Joan. 16.10. (...).
. He was taken up into Heaven, and became invisible unto Men.

And the Author imperfecti Operis in Matthaeum Homil. 53. Si sit praesens, non
creditur, sed videtur; cum autem absens fuerit, non videtur, sed creditur, dum
timetur.
. When he is present, he is not believed, but seen; but when he is absent, he
is not seen, but believed, whilst he is feared.

2 Assertion. The Fathers assert, That every Body is quantum, and as it ahs
Quantity, possesses a Place or Space, and is commensurate to it: That a Body
cannot be in more than one Place, nor be entire in one Part, nor exist after
the manner of a Spirit. All which are false, if Transubstantiation be true.
S. Basil Contr. Eunom. l. 2. (...).
makes that to be incorporeal, whose Essence cannot be divided three ways (or
has not three Dimensions).

Greg. Nyssen De Opific. Hom. c. 24. (...).
says, That if you take Quantity, Solidness, and other Properties from the
Subject, the whole Nature of the Body is dissolved, etc.

S. Austin says so much upon this Argument, that I must only mention some few
Testimonies out of a great Heap that might be collected.

He says Lib. 4. de Orig. Animae, c. 11. Corpus est quicquid majoribus and
minoribus suis partibus, majora and minora spatia locorum continentibus,
constat.
, A Body is that which consists of greater and lesser Parts, containing greater
and lesser Spaces of Place.

Again Epist. 3. ad Volusian. Quorum nullum potest esse ubique totum, quoniam
per innumerabiles parts aliud alibi habeat necesse est: and quantumcumque sit
corpus seu quantulumcunque corpusculum loci occupet spatium, eundemque locum
sic impleat, ut in nulla ejus part sit totum. -- Non sic Deus dicitur implere
mundum, velut aqua, velut aer, ut minore sui part minorem mundi impleat
partem, and majore majorem. Novit ubique totus esse, and nullo contineri loco.
, distinguishing Bodies into gross and subtle ones, he says, Both are Bodies,
none of which can be every where whole and entire, because by reason of its
innumerable Parts, it must have another Place elsewhere; and how great or
little soever a Body is, it possesses a Space of Place, and so fills that
Place, that it is not whole in any part of it. And a little after: God is not
thus said to fill the World, in the same manner as Water or Air does, so that
by a lesser part of himself he fills a lesser part of the World, and by a
greater part a greater. So that, according to him, none but God and Spirits can
have such an Existence.

So in his Epistle to Euodius Epist. 101. Nullum esse quantulumcunque
corpusculum, quod non pro suo modo loci occupet spatium; nec in eo quod occupat
ubique sit totum, sed minus sit in part quam in toto.
. There is no Body so little, which after its manner does not possess a local
Space; neither is it whole every where in that Space it possesses, but less in
a part of that Space than in the whole.

And again Contra Epist. Manichaei, cap. 16. Nec omnino potest esse aliquod
corpus sive coeleste, sive terrestre, sive aereum, sive humidum, quod non minus
sit in part quam in toto, neque ullo modo possit in loco hujus partis habere
aliam partem, sed aliud hic, aliud alibi per spatia quaelibet locorum distantia
and dividua, etc.
. There can be no Body, either Celestial or Terrestrial, Aereal or Aqueous,
that is not less in a part than in the whole; nor can it any ways have another
part in the place of this part, but must have one here, another elsewhere,
throughout the several distant and divided Spaces of Place, etc.

But the Nature of the Soul is not found to be extended to the Spaces of Place
by any Bulkiness. Animae vero natura nullo modo invenitur locorum spatiis
aliqua mole distendi.


He says the same in another Epistle Ad Dardanum Epist. 57. Spatia locorum
toll corporibus, nusquam erunt; and quia nusquam erunt, nec erunt.
, and adds, Take away local Extent from Bodies, and they will be no where; and
if they are no where, they will not be at all.

In the same Epistle, speaking of the Divine Persons, that nothing hinders why
they may not be every where simul, argues thus: For they are not Bodies, Non
enim corpora sunt, quorum amplior sit in tribus quam in singulis magnitudo, nec
loca suis molibus tenent, ut distantibus spatiis simul esse non possint.
whose Magnitude is larger in Three than in One; nor do they possess Places by
their Bulk, so as not to be able to be in distant Spaces at once, (which is the
Nature, he acknowledges, of Bodies).

He says also of Christ, Ubique totum praesentem esse non dubites tanquam Deum,
and in eodem Templo Dei esse tanquam inhabitantem Deum, and in loco aliquo
coeli, propter very corporis modum.
We are not to doubt that whole Christ is every where present as God, and is in
the same Temple of God, as an inhabiting Deity, and in one certain place of
Heaven, by reason of the Nature of his true Body.

Elsewhere De Civit. Dei, l. 22. c. 29. Deus totus in coelo est, totus in
terra, non alternis temporibus sed utrumque simul, quod nulla natura corporalis
potest.
. God is whole in Heaven, and whole on Earth; not at different times
successively, but both together; which no Corporeal Nature is capable of.

Again Epist. 6. ad Italicam. Omne quod oculis corporeis conspici potest, in
loco aliquo sit necesse est, neque ubique sit totum, sed minore sui part
minorem locum occupet, and majore majorem.
. Every thing that may be seen with Bodily Eyes, must of necessity be in some
Place; nor can it be whole every where, but must possess a lesser Place by a
lesser Part of it self, and a greater Place by a greater Part.

He repeats almost the same, in his Twenty eighth Epistle.

And in another Book Cont. Epist. Manichaei, c. 16. Aeris parts suos quoque
implent locos, nec fieri potest ut aer quo impletur haec domus, simul secum in
eadem domo habere possit etiam illum aerem quem vicini habent.
. The Parts of Air also fill their Places; nor is it possible that the Air that
fills this House, should together with it have the Air that is in a Neighbor's
House.

Again elsewhere De Immort. Animae, c. 16. Moles omnis quae occupat locum, non
est in singulis suis partibus tota, sed in omnibus, quare aliqua pars ejus
alibi est, and alibi alia.
. Every thing of Bulk that possesses a Place, is not whole in its single Parts,
but whole in all its Parts; therefore one Part of it is in this Place, and
another in another.

In another Tract Tract. 31. in Joan. Homo secundum corpus in loco est, and de
loco migrat, and cum ad alium locum venerit, in eo loco unde venit non est:
Deus autem implet omnia and ubique totus est, non secundum spatia tenetur
locis. Erat tamen Christus secundum visibilem carnem in terra, secundum
invifibilem Majestatem in coelo and in terra.
. Man, as to his Body, is in a Place, and passes from one Place to another; and
when he comes to another Place, he is no longer in that Place from whence he
came. But God fills all things, and is every where whole, not confined to
Places according to Spaces. Christ, according to his visible Flesh, was on
Earth; according to his invisible Majesty, in Heaven and Earth.

To name but two or three more out of S. Austin, who seems to speak
Prophetically De Unit. Eccles. c. 10. His dictis mox ascendit in coelum,
praemunire voluit aures nostras adversus eos, qui procedentibus temporibus
exsurrecturos esse praedixerat, and dicturos, Ecce hic Christus, ecce illic.
Quibus nec crederemus admonuit. Nec ulla nobis excusatio est, si crediderimus
contra vocem Pastoris nostri tam claram, tam apertam, tam manifestam, etc.
. Having said thus, he ascended into Heaven, and would precaution us against
those that he foretold would arise in succeeding Ages, and say, Lo here is
Christ, or lo there; whom he warned us not to believe: And we shall have no
Excuse if we shall believe them against this so clear, open, and manifest Voice
of our Pastor, etc.

And in his Book against Faustus Lib. 20. cap. 11. Secundum praesentiam
corporalem simul and in Sole, and in Luna, and in Cruce esse non posset.
, he says, That Christ, according to his Corporal Presence, cannot be at the
same time in the Sun, and in the Moon, and on the Cross.

Lastly, in another Tract Tract. 30. in Joan. Sursum est Dominus, sed etiam hic
est veritas Dominus. Corpus enim Domini in quo resurrexit uno loco esse oportet
( the Printed Copies absurdly read potest) veritas ejus ubique diffusa est.
. Our Lord is above, yet also Truth the Lord is here: For the Body of our Lord
in which he arose, must be in one Place; his Truth is diffused every where.

Neither do the rest of the Fathers differ from his Doctrine, but give their
full Consent to it.

Anastasius Nicaenus In Collect. adv. Severianos in Bibl. Patr. Tom. 4.
Impossible est cogitare corpus sine loco, and sine aliis extra quae esse non
potest, etc.
. It is impossible to imagine a Body without a Place, and other things without
which it cannot be, etc.

Didymus Alexandr. De Spiritu S. lib. 1. Ipse Spiritus S. si unus de creaturis
esset, saltem circumscriptam haberet substantiam, sicut universae quae factae
sunt -- Spiritus autem, cum in pluribus sit, non habet substantiam
circumscriptam.
proves the Holy Ghost to be God, because he is in more Places than one. The
Holy Ghost himself, if he were one of the Creatures, would at least have a
circumscribed (or bounded) Substance, as all things have that are made -- But
the Holy Spirit, seeing he is in more than one, has not a bounded Substance.
And afterward he says, That the Holy Ghost was present with the Apostles, though
dispersed to the ends of the Earth; and adds, Angelica virtus ab hoc prorsus
aliena.
The Power of Angels is altogether a Stranger to this.

Theodoret In Genes. qu. 3. (...).
makes this a Consequence from Angels being of a determinate Substance, That
then they require a Place to be in: For only the Divinity, says he, as being
undetermined, is not in a Place. And elsewhere Dialog. 2. (...).
, speaking of Christ's Body after the Resurrection, he says, Still it is a
Body, having its former Circumscription.

Cyril of Alexandria De S. Trinit. Dial. 2.
, disputing against those that thought the Son was begotten of the Substance of
the Father, by a division of his Substance, (...)
says, If the Divine Nature did admit of Section and Division, then you
conceive of it as a Body; and if so, then it must be in a Place, and in
Magnitude and Quantity; and if endued with Quantity, it could not avoid being
circumscribed.

Fulgentius Ad Trasimund. lib. 2. c. 7. Quod aliquo circumscribitur fine,
necesse est ut loco teneatur aut tempore.
also. That which is circumscribed by any End (or Bound), must be contained in
a Place, or in Time.

And again Ib. c. 18. Si verum est corpus Christi, loco utique oportet
contineri. ( The printed Copies read potest contineri, without Sense.)
, speaking of Christ's Body: If the Body of Christ be a true one, it must be
contained in a Place.

S. Greg. Nazianzen (...). Orat. 34.
makes it impossible for one Body to be in diverse.

So does Damascen De Fide Orth. l. 1. c. 4.
make it impossible that one Body should pass through another, unless there be
(...), that which divides, and that which is divided.

Claud. Mamertus De Statu Animae, l. 2. c. 3. Nihil illocale corporeum: omne
illocale incorporeum quoque est.
. Nothing illocal is corporeal: every thing illocal is also incorporeal.

And again Ibid. lib. 1. c. 18. Hinc patet omne corpus totum simul tangi non
posse, nec in uno loco esse quamlibet minimum totum posse. -- Illic non habet
inferiora sua ubi habet superiora sua, nec illic dextra ubi sinistra, nec
anteriora illic ubi posteriora.
. It is plain, that no Body can be touched wholly together, nor can the least
Whole you can imagine, be in one Place, (that is, in one Point.) And he
instances in a Grain of Poppy, or the least part of it, That it has not its
lower Parts there where it has its upper Parts, nor its righthand Parts there
where its left hand Parts are, nor its Parts before there where it has its
Parts behind.

S. Hilary In Psalm. 124. Spiritus namque est omnia penetrans and continens. Non
enim secundum nos corporalis est, ut cum alicubi adsit, absit aliunde, etc.
speaking of Christ as God, says, He is a Spirit penetrating and containing all
things. For according to us he is not corporeal, so that when he is present in
one Place, he should be absent from another, etc.

And elsewhere Lib. 8. de Trinitate. Homo, aut aliquid ei simile, cum alicubi
erit, tum alibi non erit; quia illud quod est illic continetur ubi fuerit,
infirma ad id natura ejus, ut ubique sit, qui insistens alicubi sit.
. A Man, or any thing like him, when he is in a Place any where, cannot then be
elsewhere; because that which is there, is contained where it is; and he that
is placed any where, his Nature is incapable to be every where.

So also Nazianzen Orat. 51. (...).
. A Vessel of the capacity of one Measure, will not contain two Measures; nor
the Place that will hold one Body, can receive two or more Bodies into it.

Again Paulo post. (...).
a little after. This is the Nature of Intellectual Beings, that incorporeally
and indivisibly they mingle with one another, and with Bodies.

And elsewhere Orat. 37. (...).
he proves the Deity of the Holy Ghost, because he penetrates all intellectual,
pure, and most subtle Spirits (as the Angels, and also Apostles and Prophets)
at the same time, when they are not in the same places, but dispersed
severally; which shows, that the Holy Spirit is uncircumscribed.

S. Basil uses the same Argument De Spir. S. cap. 14. (...), etc.
to prove the same. Every one of the other Powers we believe to be in a
circumscribed Place; for the Angel that was present to Cornelius, was not in
the same place that he was in when he was present to Philip; nor the Angel that
talked with Zacharias at the Atar, did at the same time fulfill his Station in
Heaven. But the Spirit, we believe, could at the same time act both in Abaccuk,
and in Daniel when he was in Babylon, etc. For the Spirit of the Lord filled
the Universe. Which is an ill Argument, (...)
if Christ's Body could be in more Places at the same time.

Arnobius Lib. 6. contra Gentes. In simulachris Dii habitant, singuline in
singulis toti, an partiliter atque in membra divisi? Nam neque unus Deus in
compluribus potis est uno tempore inesse simulachris, neque rursus in parts
sectione interveniente divisus. Constituamus enim december millia simulachrorum
toto esse in orb Vulcani: nunquid esse ut dixi, december omnibus in millibus
potis est unus uno in tempore? Non opinor. Qua causa? Quia quae sunt privata
singulariaque natura multa fieri nequeunt, simplicitatis suae integritate
servata. -- Si hoc fuerit sumptum, posse unum in omnibus eodem tempore
permanere, aut Deorum unusquisque dicendus ita ipsum semet ab ipso se dividere,
ut and ipse sit and alter, non aliquo discrimine separatus, sed and ipse idem
and alius; quod quoniam recusar and respuit aspernaturque natura, aut innumeros
dicendum est confitendumque esse Vulcanos, si in cunctis volumus eum degere
atque inesse simulachris, aut crit in nullo, quia esse divisus natura
prohibetur in plurimis.
disputing against the Heathens, who said that their Gods did inhabit their
Statues, whom yet they believed to be finite and bounded, urges them thus. The
Gods that inhabit in Statues, are they single Gods that are in single Statues
whole, or divided into several parts? For one God (finite as theirs were)
cannot be in many Statues at the same time, nor again exist divided into Parts,
by being cut asunder. For let us suppose that there are ten thousand Statues of
Vulcan all the World over: can one at one time be in all those ten thousand
Statues? I think not. If you ask, Why so? Even because those things that are of
a particular and singular Nature, cannot be made many, retaining the entireness
of their simplicity. Again: -- If this be supposed, that one Deity can dwell in
them all at one time, then you must either say of every God, that he can divide
himself from himself, so as to be the same, and another too, not separated by
any difference, but that he shall be the very same, and yet another; which
because Nature refuses and rejects, you must say and confess, That there are
innumerable Vulcans, if we will suppose him to be and to dwell in all his
Statues; or else that he is in none of them, because Nature prohibits his
division among many. All this would be very ill Reasoning, if he believed that
which the Church of Rome does, That all this which he disputes against, is done
in the Eucharist.

S. Ambrose Lib. de Spir. S. c. 7. Cum omnis creatura certis suae naturae sit
circumscripta limitibus, etc. quomodo quis audeat creaturam appellare Spiritum
S. qui non habeat circumscriptam determinatamque virtutem? quia and in omnibus
and ubique semper est, quod utique Divinitatis and Dominationis est proprium.
-- De quo hoc Angelo Scriptura dicit? de qua Dominatione? de qua Potestate?
Cujus invenimus Angeli virtutem per plurimos effe diffusam? -- Quis ergo
dubitet quin divinum sit, quod infunditur simul pluribus nec videtur; corporeum
autem quod videtur a singulis and tenetur?
. Since every Creature is bounded within certain Limits of its Nature, etc. how
dare any one call the Holy Ghost a Creature, who has not a limited and
determined Virtue? For he is always in all things, and in all places, which is
the Property of the Divinity, and of Supreme Rule.

And afterward mentioning that place of the Psalmist, Whither shall I go from
thy Spirit? he adds, Of what Angel does the Scripture say thus? of what
Principality? of what Power? What Angel's Virtue do we find diffused among
many? -- Who can doubt then that to be Divine, that is at once infused into
more, and is not seen; and that to be Corporeal, which is seen of every one,
and held by them?

No^^a^ian Lib. de Trinitate. Si homo tantummodo Christus, quomodo adest ubique
invocaturis? cum haec non hominis natura est sed Dei, ut adesse in omni loco
possit.
also proves the Deity of Christ, by his Presence in every place. If Christ be
only Man, how is be every where present with those that call upon him? seeing
this is not the Nature of Man, but of God, to be present in every place.

Author Quaest. ad Antioch. Quaest. 26. (...).
denies that Angels can be present in many places at once, and adds, That it is
God's Property only to be found in two places, and in the whole World at the
same moment of time.

In consequence of this Doctrine of theirs about Bodies, the Fathers in the
last place assert,

3 Assertion. That is it impossible for one to dwell in himself, or to partake
of, and have ones own Body in himself; because whatsoever contains, must be
greater than that which is contained in it; and there would be a Penetration of
Dimensions, which they deny.
Cyril of Alex. De Trin. Dialog. 6. (...).
lays it down as a Rule, that Nothing can partake of it self.

And elsewhere Ibid. Dial. 5. and 7. (...).
. Seeing nothing can partake of it self, but this is with relation to another,
it is altogether necessary to affirm, That that which partakes should be
different in nature from that which is partaked of.

And again Idem in Joan. lib. 2. c. 1. (...).
he says, That to partake of ones self, is absurd so much as to imagine it.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 10. in Joan. citat. a Theodoret. Dial. 2. (...) -- (...).
says, He that dwells in the Tabernacle, and the Tabernacle it self, are not
the same; but one thing dwells in another thing; for nothing dwells in it self.

Gelasius Caesarien. Citat. a Theodoret. Dial. 1. (...).
. The Word was made Flesh, not being it self changed, but dwelling in us. The
Tabernacle is one thing, and the Word is another; the Temple is one thing, and
God that dwells in it another.

See also the like Saying in Methodius, cited by Photius his Bibliotheca. Cod.
234. page 920. ult. Edit.

In a word, the Fathers oppose all Penetration of Dimensions in Bodies, and say
Author. Libr. cui tit. Celebres Opiniones de Anima, c. 10. (...).
, That it is impossible for one Body to penetrate another Body.

And the same Author says Ibid. cap. ult. Sic dici posset in milii grano coelum
contineri.
, That if this were possible, you might then say, That Heaven it self might be
contained in a Grain of Millet.

The Fathers argue against Marcion, upon this Rule, That whatsoever contains
another thing, is greater than that which is contained in it.

So does Epiphanius Haeres. 42. sec. 7. (...).
. So does Tertullian Contr. Marcion. l. 1. c. 15.
. Irenaeus Adv. Haer. l. 2. c. 1.
has the same Rule, and laughs at Marcion's God upon that account.

Greg. Nyssen De Vita Mosis.
proves that the Deity has no Bounds, by this Argument, That otherwise what
contains would be greater than the Deity contained therein.

Theophylus Antioch. Ad Autolycum, l. 2. (...).
says, This is the Property of the Almighty and True God, not only to be every
where, but to inspect and hear all things. Neither is he contained in a Place,
for else the containing Place would be greater than himself; for that which
contains, is greater than that which is contained in it.

I will conclude this Chapter with the remarkable Words of Fulgentius De Fide
ad Petr. c. 3. Unaquaeque res ita permaner, sicut a Deo accepit ut esset, alia
quidem sic, alia autem sic. Neque enim sic datum est corporibus ut sint, sicut
spiritus acceperunt, etc.
. Every thing so remains, as it has received of God that it should be, one on
this manner, and another on that. For it is not given to Bodies to exist after
such a manner as is granted unto Spirits, etc.

CHAP. VI. The Sixth Difference. The Church of Rome ( suitably to the strange
Doctrine it teaches about Christ's Body and Blood) teaches us not to believe
the Report our Senses make, That the Substance of Bread and Wine remain in the
Sacrament; but to pass a contrary Judgment to what they inform us herein. But
the Fathers teach the contrary, That we may securely rely upon the Evidence of
our Senses, as to any Body, even as to the true Body of Christ.
THat the Church of Rome would not have us in this Matter to attend to the
Evidence of Sense, is needless to prove, since nothing is more common than to
hear them call upon us to distrust them, and to believe against their Report.
Thus the Trent Catechism Ad Paroch. de Euchar. part. 2. number. 25. -- Nullam
Elementorum substantiam remanere, quamvis nihil magis a sensibus alienum and
remotum videri possit.
teaches us to believe, That no Substance of the Elements remains in the
Eucharist, though nothing seems more strange and remote from our Senses than
this. And again Ib. n. 46. Corpus and sanguinem Domini ita sumimus, ut tamen
quod vere sit, sensibus percipi non potest.
, We so receive the Body and Blood of Christ, that yet we cannot perceive by
our Senses that it is truly so.

As for the Fathers, they are Strangers to this Doctrine, nor did they betray
the Christian Cause in this manner, by taking away all Certainty from the
Testimony of our Senses. They, on the contrary, proved the Truth of Christ's
Body against the Valentinians, the Marcionites, and other Heretics, by this
Argument, which the Church of Rome rejects; they made their Appeals frequently
(as S. John had done before them) to what had been seen with Men's Eyes, to what
their Ears had heard, and their Hands had handled, without any suspicion of
their being deceived.

Thus Irenaeus Lib. 3. adv. Haeres. c. 20. Hoc autem and illis occurrit, qui
dicunt eum putative passum: Si enim non vere passus est, nulla gratia ei, cum
nulla fuerit passio. Et nos cum incipiemus vere pati, seducens videbitur,
adhortans nos vapulare and alteram praebere maxillam, si ipse illud non prior
in veritate passus est. Et quemadmodum illos seduxit, ut videretur ipse hoc
quod non erat, and nos. seducit adhortans perferre ea quae ipse non pertulit.
. This meets with them who say, That Christ suffered only seemingly. For if he
did not truly suffer, no Thanks are due to him, when there was no Passion. And
when he shall begin truly to suffer, he will seem a Seducer, when he exhorts us
to suffer Stripes, and to turn the other Cheek, if he first did not suffer this
in truth. And as he seduced them, in seeming to be that which he was not; so he
seduces us, whilst he exhorts us to suffer the things which he did not suffer.

Again Id. lib. 5. cap. 1. citante Theodoreto, Dial. 2. (...).
. These things were not done seemingly only, but in reality of truth; for if he
appeared to be a Man when he was not so, he neither did remain the Spirit of
God, which he truly was, since a Spirit is invisible, nor was there any Truth
in him; for he was not that which he appeared to be. He thought it, you see,
absurdity enough to say, That Christ appeared what he was not. But what
absurdity can this be to them that say, it is constantly so in the Sacrament,
where that appears so and so, which is not so, as the Bread and Wine, according
to them, does?

Again Id. lib. 5. cap. 7. Quomodo igitur Christus in carnis substantia
resurrexit and ostendit discipulis figuram clavorum and apertionem lateris;
haec autem sunt indicia carnis ejus quae surrexit a mortuis; sic and nos,
inquit, suscitabit per virtutem suam.
. As Christ therefore rose again in the Substance of our Flesh, and showed to
his Disciples the Print of the Nails and the Opening of his Side, and these are
Indications of his Flesh which arose from the Dead; so also, he says, he will
raise us up by his Power.

Tertullian also argues thus against Marcion De carne Christi, c. 5. Maluit,
creed, nasci, quam aliqua ex part mentiri, and quidem in semetipsum; ut carnem
gestaret sine ossibus duram, sine musculis solidam, sine sanguine cruentam,
sine tunica vestitam, sine fame esurientem, sine dentibus edentem, sine lingua
loquentem, ut phantasma auribus fuerit sermo ejus per imaginem vocis.
. Believe it, he chose rather to be born (which Marcion thought absurd) than in
any respect to lie, and that against himself; so as to carry Flesh about him
hard without Bones, solid without Muscles, bloody without Blood, clothed
without a Garment, craving Food without Hunger, eating without Teeth, speaking
without a Tongue, so that his Speech was a Phantasm to Men's Ears by the Image
only of a Voice. Then he instances in Christ's showing his Hands and Feet to
his Disciples after his Resurrection: Behold, says he, it is I my self; for a
Spirit has not Flesh and Bones. But, as he goes on, Ecce fallit and decipit and
circumvenit omnium oculos, omnium sensus, omnium accessus and contactus. Ergo
jam Christum non de coelo defer debueras, sed de aliquo circulatorio coetu,
etc.
according to Marcion's Interpretation, Behold, he cozens, and deceives, and
circumvents all Men's Eyes, all Men's Senses, all their Approaches and Touches.
Thou therefore should not have brought down Christ from Heaven, but from some
Society of Juglers, etc.

Again Idem. adv. Marcion. l. 3. c. 8. Jam nunc cum mendacium deprehenditur
Christi caro; sequitur ut and omnia quae per carnem Christi gesta sunt,
mendacio gesta sunt, congressus, contactus, convictus, ipsae quoque virtutes.
Ibid. An credam ei de interiore substantiae, qui sit de exteriore frustratus?
Quomodo verax habebitur in occulto, qui fallax repertus in aperto?
. Now when the Flesh of Christ is found to be a Falsity, it follows also, That
all the things done by the Flesh of Christ, are falsely acted; such as his
meeting Persons, his touching them, his Conversation, and even his Miracles
themselves, etc.

And when Marcion had instanced in the Appearances of Angels to Abraham and to
Lot, like Men, meeting with them, and eating, and doing that they were
commanded, Tertullian answers Ibid. c 9. Scito, nec illud concedi tibi, ut
putativa fuerit in Angelis caro, sed verae and solidae substantiae humanae.
, Know that this is not granted neither, that those Angels had only seeming
Flesh, but of a true, solid, humane Substance.

He adds afterward Ibid. c. 10. Sufficit mihi hoc definire, quod Deo congruit,
veritatem scilicet illius rci, quam tribus testibus sensibus objecit, visui,
tactui, auditui.
, It suffices me to define that, which is agreeable to God, viz. the truth of
that thing, which he has made the Object of three Senses that testify it, viz.
Sight, Touch, and Hearing.

And again Ibid. c. 11. Jam Deum tuum honoras fallaciae titulo, si aliud se
esse sciebat, quam quod homines fecerat opinari.
, Thou now honor thy God with the Title of Fallaciousness, if he knew
himself to be another thing, than what he made Men to believe he was.

And in his next Book against Marcion Lib. 4. c. 18. Illius peccatricis feminae
argumentum eo pertinebit, ut cum pedes Domini osculis figeret, lacrymis
inundaret, crinibas detergeret, unguento perduceret, solidi corporis veritatem,
non phantasma inane tractaverit.
. The Argument of the Woman that was a Sinner belongs to this, to prove that
when she kissed our Lord's Feet, watered them with her Tears, wiped them with
her Hairs, and anointed them, she then handled the Truth of a solid Body, and
not an empty Phantome.

Again, in the last Chapter Ibid. c. 43. Cur autem inspectui eorum manus and
pedes suos offert, quae membra ex offibus constant, si ossa non habebat? Cur
adjecit, and scitote quod ego sum, quem scilicet corporeum retro noverant?
. Why does he offer to their inspection his Hands and his Feet, which are
Members consisting of Bones, if he had no Bones? Why did he add, and know that
it is I my self, to wit, whom they had known before to have had a Body?

May not we ask, agreeably to this Reasoning of Tertullian, Why does Christ
offer to our sight the Accidents of Bread and Wine, if there be no Bread and
Wine remaining in the Eucharist; especially when what we see, we knew to be
Bread and Wine before?

But the most remarkable Testimony of Tertullian's is in his Book de Anima De
Anima, cap. 17.
, where on set purpose he opposes the Academicks, that would not have Men give
credit to their Senses. He urges-against them, Nulla sensuum frustratio causa
caret, quod si causae fallunt sensus, and per sensus opiniones, jam nec in
sensibus consituenda fallacia est, qui causas sequuntur, nec in opinionibus qui
sensibus diriguntur sequentibus causas -- Quid agis, Academia procacissima?
Totum vitae statum evertis, omnem naturae ordinem turbas, ipsius Dei
providentiam excoecas, qui cunctis operibus suis intelligendis, incolendis,
dispensandis, fruendisque fallaces and mendaces Dominos praefecerit sensus, etc.
That there is no Abuse of the Senses but has a Cause of it; and if those
Causes deceive the Senses, and our Opinions by them, the Fallacy is not to be
charged upon our Senses, that follow those Causes; nor upon our Opinions, that
are directed by our Senses, which follow those Causes. -- And aftewards he
cries out, O thou malapert Academy, what do thou do? (in charging Deceit upon
the Senses) Thou overturnest the whole State of Life, thou disturbest all the
Order of Nature, thou blindest the Providence of God himself, who (according to
thee) has set lying and deceitful Senses as Lords over all his Works, for to
understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, etc.

-- It is no ways lawful and fit to call those Senses in question, -- Non
licet, non licet nobis in dubium sensus istos devocare, ne and in Christo de
fide eorum deliberetur; ne forte dicatur, quod falso Satanam prospectarit de
coelo praecipitatum; aut falso vocem Patris audierit de ipso testificatam; aut
deceptus sit cum Petri socrum tetigit, aut alium postea unguenti spiritum
senserit, quod in sepulturam suam acceptavit; alium post a vini saporem, quod
in sanguinis sui memoriam consecravit. -- Atqui ne in Apostolis quidem ejus
ludificata natura est. Fidelis fuit and visus and auditus in monte; fidelis and
gustus vini illius, licet aquae ante, in nuptiis Galilaeae; fidelis and tactus
exinde creduli Thomae.
lest we should doubt of their Credit even in Christ himself; lest it should be
said, that he falsely saw Satan thrown down from Heaven, or falsely heard his
Fathers Voice testifying concerning him, or was deceived when he touched Peter
's Wives Mother, or perceived afterward a different Scent of the Ointment
which he accepted for his Burial, and afterward a different Taste of the Wine
which he consecrated in memory of his Blood. -- Neither was Nature abused in
his Apostles. Faithful was their Sight and Hearing in the Mount; faithful and
true was the Taste of that Wine which was Water before, at the Marriage in
Galilee; faithful was Thomas 's Touch, who thereupon believed.

Recite John 's Testimony: Recita Johannis testatimem: Quod vidimus, inquit,
quod audivimus, oculis nostris vidimus, and manus nostrae contrectaverunt de
sermon vitae. Falsa utique testatio, si oculorum and aurium and manuum sensus
natura mentitur.
That which we have seen, says he, which we have heard, which we have seen with
our Eyes, and our Hands have handled of the Word of Life. This is all a false
Testification, if the Nature of the Sense of our Eyes, and Ears, and Hands is a
Lie and a Cheat.

And in the next Chapter Cap. 18. Videtur intellectus duce uti sensu, and
auctore and principali fundamento, nec sine illo veritates posse contingi.
. The Understanding seems to use Sense as a Leader, an Author, and principal
Foundation; neither can Truths be laid hold of without it.

S. Austin teaches the same De vera Relig. cap. 33. Ne ipsi quidem oculi
fallunt; non enim renunciare possunt animo nisi affectionem suam. -- Si quis
remum frangi in aqua opinatur, and cum inde aufertur integrari, non habet malum
internuncium, sed malus est judex. Nam ille pro natura sua non potuit aliter in
aqua sentire, nec aliter debuit. Si enim aliud est aer, aliud aqua, justum est
ut aliter in aere, aliter in aqua sentiatur. Quare oculus recte videt; ad hoc
enim factus est ut tantum videat: sed animus perverse judicat, etc.
Doctrine. Our Eyes do not deceive us, for they can only report to the Mind how
they are affected. -- If one thinks that an Oar is broken in the Water, and
when it is taken out of the Water made whole again, he has not a Bad Reporter,
but he is an ill Judge. For the Eye, according to its Nature, neither could nor
ought to perceive it otherwise while in the Water; For if the Air is a
different Medium from Water, it must perceive it one ways in the Air, and
another ways in Water. Therefore the Eye sees rightly; for it was made only to
see: But the Mind judges amiss, etc.

So also S. Hillary In Psalm. 137. Tollit stultissimam eorum temeritatem, qui
frustrato falsoque corpore Dominum in carne visum esse contendunt; ut eum Pater
ementita veritate in habitu falsae carnis ostenderit; non recordantes post
resurrectionem corporis spiritum se videre credentibus Apostolis dictum esse,
Quid conturbati, etc. videte manus and pedes meos, quoniam ipse ego sum,
palpate and videte, quoniam spiritus carnem and ossa non habet, sicut me
videtis habere.
He takes away their foolish Rashness, who contend that our Lord was seen in
the Flesh in a deceitful and false Body; that the Father feigning Truth, showed
him in the habit of false Flesh, (as the Romanists make Christ's Body to be
shown in habitu falsi panis) not remembering what was said after his
Resurrection to the Apostles that thought they saw a Spirit; Why are ye
troubled, etc. Behold my Hands and my Feet, that it is I my self; for a Spirit
has not Flesh and Bones, as ye see me have.

Epiphanius Here Is. 42.
is very large in arguing the Truth of Christ's Body, from what was sensibly
done to his Body; and if he argues truly, then what is sensibly done to the
Bread in the Eucharist, proves the Truth of Bread remaining, and not only the
Appearance of it.

He asks Marcion Ibid. Refut. 4. (...).
, How could he be taken and crucified, if, according to thy saying, he could
not be handled? -- For thou can not define him to be a Phantome, whom thou
confessest to fall under the Touch.

Again Ibid. Refut. 10. and 11. (...).
he argues, That Christ had a true Body, because he went into the Pharisee's
House and sat down. That which sits down, is a bulky Body.

And when the Woman washed his Feet with her Tears, (...)
he adds, Not the Feet of a Phantome. And kissed them, perceiving his Body by
her Touch. And, What Feet did she kiss, but the Feet made up of Flesh and
Bones, and other Parts?

So again Ibid. Refut. 14. (...).
, the Woman that touched Christ and was healed, she did not touch Air, but
something Humane that might be touched.

Again Ib. Refut. 16. (...).
. An Imaginary thing, or Wind, or a Spirit or Phantome, admits neither of
Burial nor a Resurrection. But why may not a Phantome as well be buried and
raised, as Accidents be broken and distributed, when no Bread remains?

Again, he observes Refut. 65.
from that of his kneeling down and praying, That all this was done (...),
because his Disciples saw him, and he was found to his Disciples under their
Touch. (...)


So also concerning Christ's Crucifixion, he observes Ibid. Refut. 71.
, That the piercing his Hands and Feet with Nails, and handling of them to do
it, could not be (...), an imagination or show. But if the Church of Rome say
true, he is out; for it is only (...) and a Phantome, when I chew and fasten my
Teeth in the Host, there being no Substance that I bite.

He afterward Ibid. Refut. 77. (...).
challenges Marcion from that Expression, He was known in breaking of Bread.
How, says he, was this breaking of Bread performed? was it by a Phantome, or
from a Body (...).
bulky, and really acting it?

Here I may well observe, That if the very breaking of Bread, argues a true
Body that did perform that thing; how much more forcible is our Question to the
Romanists, What means the mention of Bread broken in the Eucharist, (as Christ
is said to break Bread) if nothing be broken at all but only in show and
appearance?

Epiphanius also elsewhere Haeres. 64. sec. 36. (...).
says, when Christ showed to them Moses and Elias in the Mount, He did not
present an Image or a Phantome, as intending to deceive his Apostles; but
showed what they were really.

Athanasius Orat. 2. de Ascen. Christi.
says, Christ did both eat Meat, and permitted his Body to be touched by his
Disciples, that not only their Eyes, but also their Fingers might be brought in
for Witnesses of the Truth; (...)
so removing all suspicion of a Phantome or Ghostly Appearance.

S. Chrysostom De Resurrect. Hom. 9. Lat. Paris. 1588. Tom. 3. page 775. Non
est meum meos ludificare phantasmate; vanam imaginem visus si timet, veritatem
corporis manus and digitus exploret. Potest fortasse aliqua oculos caligo
decipere, palpatio corporalis verum corpus agnoscat.
brings in Christ saying thus. It is not my way to mock or abuse mine with a
false appearance. If the Sight is afraid of a vain Image, the Hands and Fingers
may find out the Truth of my Body. Perhaps some Mist may deceive the Eyes; but
a corporal Touch owns a Body.

Also elsewhere Hom. 29. in Joan. (...).
, speaking of Seeing and Hearing, he says, By these Senses we learn all things
exactly, and seem Teachers worthy of credit, concerning such things which we
receive by our Sight or Hearing, seeing we neither feign, nor speak falsely.

But lest any one should pretend, that the Eucharist is a Mystery, and that in
such things our Senses may impose on us, and deceive us, it is very remarkable
how this Father distinguishes betwixt them.

He tells us Hom. 13. in Ep. ad Ephesians. (...).
wherein Deception does consist, viz. when a thing does not appear to be what
it is, but appears to be what it is not. But he makes a Mystery to be another
thing Hom. 7. in 1 ad Cor. (...), etc.
, viz. when we see not what we believe, but see one thing, and believe another
thing: For this, says he, is the Nature of our Mysteries.

S. Austin Sermon. de Temp. 161. Cujus prasentiam agnoscat oculus, attrectet
manus, digitus perscrutetur. -- Si forte diceremus Thomae oculos fuisse
deceptos, at non possemus dicere manus frustratas; in resurrectionis enim
manifestatione de aspectu ambigi potest, de tactu non potest dubitari.
makes the concurrent Testimony of Sense, especially that of Feeling, to give
sufficient assurance to us. Thus he says. There is no cause to doubt of
Christ's Resurrection, whose presence the Eye does own, the Hand handles, and
the Fingers examine. -- If we perhaps should say, That Thomas his Eyes were
deceived, yet we cannot say so of his Hands; for in clearing the Resurrection,
doubt may be made of the Sight, but no doubt can be made of Feeling.

Again elsewhere Contra Faustum, l. 14. c. 10. Qui nisi Daemones, quibus amica
fallacia est, istis persuaderent, Quod Christus fallaciter passus, fallaciter
mortuus sit, fallaciter cicatrices ostenderit?
. Who but Devils, that are Friends to Cozenage, could persuade them, that
Christ deceived Men, when he suffered, when he died, and when he showed his
Scars?

Again Ibid. l. 29. c. 2. Illud est quod Magiae simile dicimini asserere, quod
passionem mortemque ejus specie tenus factam and fallaciter dicitis adumbratam,
ut mori videretur, qui non moriebatur. Ex quo fit, ut ejus quoque
resurrectionem umbraticam, imaginariam fallacemque dicatis: Neque enim ejus,
qui non vere mortuus est, vera esse resurrectio potest: ita fit, ut and
cicatrices discipulis dubitantibus falsas ostenderit, nec Thomas veritate
confirmatus, sed fallacia deceptus clamaret, Dominus meus, and Deus meus, etc.
. This, which is like Magic, ye are said to assert, That Christ's Passion and
Death was only in appearance, and in a deceitful Shadow; so that he seemed to
die, when he did not die. Whence it follows, that you must assert also his
Resurrection to be in show, imaginary, and fallacious. For he cannot be truly
raised, who did not truly die: And if so, then he showed false Scars to his
doubting Disciples; neither did Thomas cry out, My Lord and my God, because he
was confirmed in the Truth, but because he was deceived by a Cheat.

Suitably to which, he asserts in another place Lib. 83. Quaestion. Quaest. 14.
Si phantasma fuit corpus Christi, fefellit Christus: and si fallit, veritas non
est. Est autem veritas Christus; non igitur phantasma fuit corpus ejus.
, If the Body of Christ was a Phantome, Christ deceived us; and if he deceive
us, he is not the Truth. But Christ is the Truth; therefore the Body of Christ
was not a Fantastical Body.

Now against all these plain Testimonies, I know only one Objection can be
made, which we are to consider, viz. Objection. That some of the Fathers call
upon us not to believe our Senses, nor to regard their Information; and that
particularly they do so in the Case of the Eucharist.

To this Objection, I shall give these satisfactory Answers.

Ans. 1. It is certain, that the Fathers appeal to our Senses even in the
matter of the Eucharist. We have seen Instances before, particularly in
Tertullian; to which let me add one remarkable Testimony out of S. Austin Sermon.
ad recen. Baptizat. apud Fulgentium, Bedam, etc. Hoc quod videtis in altari
Deietiam transacta nocte vidistis: sed quid esset, quid sibi vellet, quam
magnae rei Sacramentum contineret nondum audistis. Quod ergo videtis, panis est
and calix, quod vobis etiam oculi: vestri renunciant, etc.
. This which you see upon God's Altar, you were shown last night; but you have
not yet heard what it is, what it means, and of how great a Thing it is a
Sacrament. That which you see, is Bread and the Cup; thus much your own Eyes
inform you, etc. He appeals to their Eyes, you see, as to the Elements before
them, and suppose, that when they tell them there is Bread and a Cup, they were
not deceived. But then he informs them of that which their Senses could not be
judge of, because not an Object of them, which was understood by the Bread and
the Cup, as we shall hear afterward.

Ans 2. The Fathers call upon Men not to regard the Information of their
Senses, in matters wherein yet none questions the truth and certainty of their
Information. Therefore this is no Argument to question the Truth of what our
Senses inform us of in the Eucharist, because they would not have us to regard
them.

Thus Cyril of Jerusalem Catech. Mystag. 3. (...).
, speaking of holy Chrism. Take heed you do not think, says he, this to be mere
simple Ointment. Sense indeed reaches no further than that; but then comparing
Chrism with the Eucharist, (which is not to be looked upon as common Bread
after Consecration) he adds, (...), etc.
We are to look upon this Holy Ointment not as bare and common Ointment, after
Consecration; but as the Grace of Christ, etc.

So also he says of Baptism Idem Catech. Illum. 3. (...), etc.
, Come not to the Font as to simple and mere Water, but to the Spiritual Grace
that is given together with the Water. And a little after, Being, says he, about
to descend into the Water, do not attend to the simpleness of the Water. And
yet, for all this, he never intended to deny it to be true Water.

Gelasius Cyzic. Diatypos. c. 4. (...).
. We are not to consider our Baptism with sensitive, but with Intellectual
Eyes.

Or, as S. Austin says Sermon. 2. in Append. Sermon. 40. a Sirmondo Editor. Non
debetis aquas illas oculis aestimare, sed mente.
, You ought not to make an Estimate of those Waters with your Eyes, but with
your Mind.

Thus also S. Ambrose De his qui initiantur, c. 3. Quod vidisti aquas utique,
sed non solas, Levitas illic ministrantes, summum Sacerdotem interrogantem and
consecrantem. Primo omnium docuit te Apostolus, non ea contemplanda nobis quae
videntur, sed quae non videntur, etc. Non ergo solis corporis tui oculis
credas. Magis videtur quod non videtur, quia istud temporale, illud aeternum
aspicitur, quod oculis non comprehenditur, animo autem and mente cernitur.
, speaking of Baptism. As to what thou have seen, to wit, the Waters, and not
those alone, but Levites there ministering, and the Bishop asking Questions and
Consecrating: First of all, the Apostle has taught thee, That we are not to
look upon the things that are seen, but on the things that are not seen, etc.
Do not therefore only believe thy bodily Eyes: That is rather seen, which is
not seen; because that is Temporal, this is Eternal, which is not comprehended
by our Eyes, but is seen by our Mind and Understanding.

S. Chrysostom In Joan. Hom. 24. (...).
, speaking also of Baptism, thus breaks out. Let us believe God's Affirmation,
for this is more faithful than our Sight; for our Sight often is deceived, that
is impossible to fall to the Ground.

It is so frequent an Expression of S. Chrysostom, That God's Word is more to
be credited than our Eyes, that he applies it not only to the Sacraments, but
even to the Case of Alms giving: For thus he says Hom. 89. in Matthew. (...).
; Let us be so affected when we give Alms to the Poor, as if we gave them to
Christ himself: For his Words are more sure than our Sight. Therefore when thou
see a poor Man, remember the Words whereby Christ signified, that he himself
is fed. For though what is seen is not Christ, yet under this shape he receives
thy Alms, and asks it.

Ans. 3. The Fathers in the matter of Signs and Sacraments therefore call upon
us not to listen to our Senses, and credit them, because, in such Cases, they
would have us to consider things beyond and above their information; such as
relate to their Use and Efficacy; these being spiritual things signified by
what is visible, wherein they place the Mystery, and which Sense can neither
discover nor judge of.

S. Austin has a Rule De Doctr. Christ. l. 2. c. 1. De signis disserens, hoc
dico, ne quis in eis attendat quod sunt, sed potius quod signa sunt, id est,
quod significant. Signum est enim res, praeter speciem quam ingerit sensibus,
aliud aliquid ex se faciens in cogitationem. venire.
in this Case. I say this, treating of Signs; in which none ought to attend to
what they are, but rather that they are Signs, that is, that they signify. For
a Sign is a thing, which, besides what appears affecting the Senses, does of it
self make somewhat else to come into our thoughts.

So also Origin In Joan. tom. 18. ad finem. (...).
describes a Sign to be a Note of another thing besides that which the Sense
gives testimony to.

But none has so fully declared this Matter, and answered the former Objection,
as S. Chrysostom, in the place forecited, whose Words deserve to be set down
at large In 1 Cor. Hom. 7. Edit. Savil. Tom. 3. p. 280. (...).
. Where treating of Baptism, the Eucharist, and other Mysteries, after he has
told us (as we heard before) what a Mystery is, viz. When we do not merely
believe what we see, but see one thing and believe another, he goes on thus.

I and an Infidel are diversely affected with them. I hear that Christ was
crucified, I presently admire his Benignity: He hears the same, and he counts
it Infirmity. I hear that he was made a Servant, and I admire his Care: He,
when he hears the same, counts it Infamy. And so he goes on with his Death and
Resurrection, and the different Judgment is made of them, and proceeds to speak
of the Sacraments. (...), etc.
The Infidel hearing of the Laver (of Baptism) esteems it simply Water; but I
do not look merely upon what I see, but regard the cleansing of the Soul by the
Spirit. He thinks that my Body only is washed; but I believe that my Soul is
made clean and holy; I reckon the Burial, Resurrection, Sanctification,
Righteousness, Redemption, Adoption of Sons, the Inheritance, the Kingdom of
Heaven, the Supply of the Spirit. For, I do not judge of the things that appear
by my Sight, (...)
but by the Eyes of my Mind. I hear of the Body of Christ. I understand what is
said, one way; an Infidel, another. Which he further illustrates admirably
thus. As Children looking upon Books, know not the Power of Letters, understand
not what they look upon; nay, even to a grown Man that is unlearned, it will be
the same, when a Man of Skill will find out much hidden Virtue, Lives, and
Histories contained therein. And if one of no skill receive a Letter, he will
judge it only to be Paper and Ink; but he that has Skill hears an absent Person
speak, (...)
and discourses with him, and speaks what he pleases to him again by his
Letters. Just thus it is in a Mystery; Unbelievers hearing, seem not to hear;
but the Believers, being taught Skill by the Spirit, perceive the Power of the
hidden things.

This Discourse of S. Chrysostom's explains a Place of S. Cyril of Jerusalem
Catech. 4. Mystag. (...), etc.
, and teaches us how to understand it; where speaking of the Eucharist, he
says, Do not consider it as bare Bread and Wine; for it is the Body and Blood
of Christ, according to our Lord's Affirmation. And although Sense suggests this
to thee, let Faith confirm thee. Do not judge of the Matter by thy Taste; but
by Faith be undoubtedly persuaded, that thou art honored with the Body and
Blood of Christ. (...)


And afterward: Being fully persuaded, that the visible Bread is not Bread,
though the Taste perceive it such, but the Body of Christ; and the visible Wine
is not Wine, though the Taste would have it so, but the Blood of Christ.

All which must be only understood of the Sacramental Relation that the Bread
and Wine have to the Body and Blood of Christ, which the Sense of Tasting
acquaints us nothing at all with, and therefore is not a fit Judge of this; but
we are to believe, and not doubt of its Truth.

It will also help us to understand another Place of S. Chrysostom, ( Homil.
83. in Matthew.) where he bids us, (...), etc.
Believe God every where, without contradicting him, though what he says seems
contrary to our Reasonings, and to our Eyes; but let his Word prevail above our
Reasonings and our Eyes. Let us do the same in the Mysteries, not fixing our
Eyes only upon the things set before us, (...), etc.
but let us hold fast his Words: For his Word cannot deceive us; but our Sense
easily may: That can never fall to the ground; but this often fails. Since
therefore the Word says, (...)
This is my Body, let us be persuaded of it and believe it, and look upon it
with intellectual Eyes: For Christ has given us nothing sensible, but in
sensible things all things intelligible. Thus in Baptism, by what is sensibly
done, there is the Gift of Water; but what is perfected, is intelligible, viz.
our Regeneration and Renovation.

If the Reader does but remember that Baptism is as much concerned in this
Discourse of S. Chrysostom, as the Eucharist; and that we are as much required
not to trust our Eyes, that may deceive us, but to trust the Word of God in the
one case as well as the other; it will not give the least countenance to the
Absurdities of Transubstantiation.

And as for those Words of his, That Christ delivered nothing sensible to us,
they must be understood with an abatement, That we are not to be intent and to
fix our Thoughts merely upon what we see; for else it is certain, that there is
something sensible delivered in the Eucharist, else there would be no Sign nor
no Sacrament; and that Father would contradict himself, who in the very next
Words tells us, That by sensible things he has delivered intelligible (that is,
spiritual) things to us; for which he brings what is bestowed upon us in
Baptism as a Proof.

CHAP. VII. The Seventh Difference. When the Fathers call the Eucharist
Christ's Body and Blood, the Roman Church understands it of Christ's natural
Body given there. But the Fathers do not so; but understand it most commonly of
the Elements of Bread and Wine, even when they call them the Body of Christ,
and give us the reasons why they so call them.
INeed not tell you, how the Romish Writers catch at every place of the
Fathers, where they meet with the mention of Christ's Body and Blood: all their
Citations are full of little else but Testimonies of this kind.

But if they had a mind to understand their sense, and did not merely listen to
the sound of their words, they would quickly see them interpret themselves, so
that there could be no mistake, nor countenance given hereby to
Transubstantiation, or any presence of Christ but what is spiritual. Which by a
few Observations out of them will appear.

1. Observe. The Fathers give us warning of it, and tell us, That they
studiously conceal and hide the Mysteries from some persons, both out of the
Church, and in it. Therefore their mere expressions concerning it, are not
sufficient to inform us of their meaning.

Thus Cyril of Jerusalem Catech. Illum. 6. page 149. Edit. 4. Paris. 1608.
(...), etc.
tells us, That we do not speak openly of the mysteries among the Catechumens,
but often speak many things covertly, that the faithful that are acquainted
with the matter, may understand it, and they that are unacquainted may not be
hurt.

S. Austin In Psalm. 103. Quid est quod occultum est, and non publicum in
Ecclesia^ Sacramentum Baptismi, Sacramentum Eucharistiae. Opera nostra bona
vident and Pagani, Sacramenta vero occultantur illis.
in like manner. What is it that is hidden and not public in the Church? The
Sacrament of Baptism, and the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The very Pagans see
our good works, but the Sacraments are hid from them.

S. Chrysostom In 1 Cor. 15. Hom. 40.
(upon those words, why are they then Baptized for the dead) says, I have a
mind to speak it openly, but I dare not, (...)
because of them that are not initiated. (...)
For they make our Exposition more difficult, compelling us either not to speak
plainly, or to declare to them things that ought to be concealed.

Upon this account they concealed what was apt to be despised (whether they did
well or no in this I shall not here question) scarce vouchsafing to name the
visible Elements, but mentioning them with more glorious Titles, such as could
not be disregarded. Thus they called Baptism by the name of (...),
illumination; and they called the Eucharist, the Sacrifice, quod norunt
fideles, which the faithful know, (thus concealing it) or the Sacrifice of the
Body and Blood of Christ. They call the Lords Table an Altar, and the Ministers
Priests, though all these are to be understood in a figurative and improper sense.

Thus S. Austin says De verb. Dom. Sermon. 53. Pene quidem Sacramentum omnes
corpus ejus dicunt.
, Almost all call the Sacrament the Body of Christ. Which very phrase shows,
that the Sacrament is not in substance Christ's natural Body. For who would
phrase it so, almost all call it, in giving a proper name to a thing? ex. gr.
would any say, that almost all call a House a House, or a Man a Man? but to
say, that almost all call Kings Gods, tells you, that however for certain
Reasons, Kings are called Gods, yet they are not really and properly so.

The same Father De Trinit. l. 3. c. 4. -- Sed illud tantum quod ex fructibus
terrae acceptum and prece mystica consecratum, rite sumimus ad salutem
spiritualem, etc.
speaking of several things, whereby Christ may be signified and set forth,
either by words written, or spoken, etc. he says, We do not call these the Body
and Blood of Christ, but that only, which being taken from the fruits of the
earth, is rightly received by us to our spiritual health, etc.

If the other things had been called so, any one would have understood it must
be improperly so called, and so must this too, as his following words tell us,
Non sanctificatur ut sit tam magnum Sacramentum, nisi operante invisibiliter
Spiritu Dei.
that even this is not sanctified to become so great a Sacrament, but by the
invisible operation of the Spirit of God.

So Isidore of Sevil Orig. Lib. 6. cap. 19. Eo (sc. Christo) jubente, corpus
Christi and sanguinem dicimus, quod dum fit ex fructibus terrae, sanctificatur,
and fit Sacramentum, operante invisibiliter Spiritu Dei.
gives the same account, By the command of Christ, we call the Body and Blood
of Christ, that which being made of the fruits of the earth, is sanctified and
made a Sacrament by the invisible operation of the spirit of God.

2. Observe. The Fathers oft-times in their very manner of speaking concerning
the Body and Blood of Christ, point at another thing than his Natural Body; so
that we need no Commentary upon their words to explain them, for they carry at
first hearing our sense and meaning in them, and not that of the Romanists. To
give a few instances.

S. Cyprian Epist. 63. ad Caecilium. Cum dicat Christus, ego sum vitis vera,
sanguis Christi non aqua est utique sed vinum -- Quomodo nec Corpus Domini
potest esse farina sola, aut aqua sola, nisi utrumque adunatum fuerit and
copulatum, and panis unius compagine folldatum.
discoursing against those that Consecated and drank only Water in the
Sacrament, says, When Christ says, I am the true Vine, the Blood of Christ it is
plain is not Water but Wine. -- So neither can the Lords Body be flour alone,
or water alone, unless both of them be united, and coupled and kneaded tegether
into one Loaf.

Where no Body can doubt of S. Cyprian's meaning, that by Christ's Body he
understands not his natural Body, but the Sacrament of it.

And so the Council of Carthage, Pandect. Canon. p. 565. (...).
decreed against the Armenians (who made use of Wine only in the Eucharist)
That nothing shall be offered, but the Body and Blood of Christ, as the Lord
himself delivered it, (the phrase carries its sense in the face of it, if they
had said no more, but they add) that is, Bread and Wine mixed with Water.

What can be more plain than that of Theodoret Dialog. 1. (...), etc.
, when he says, That our Savior changed the names, and on his Body he put the
name of the sign (or symbol) and on the sign the name of his Body? A little
before he shows how. You know, says he, that God called his Body Bread, and
elsewhere he called his flesh Wheat ((...)), except a Corn of Wheat fall to the
Earth and die, Matthew. 12. But in the delivery of the mysteries, he called Bread
his Body, and that which is mixed ((...)) Blood. Is it not clear, that neither
in one case, nor the other, these sayings are to be understood properly, but
figuratively? Especially when Theodoret, before all I now have cited, makes
this comparison. As after Consecration, Ib. (...).
we call the mystical fruit of the Vine the Lords blood; so he (Jacob) called
the Blood of the true Vine, the Blood of the Grape. Both the one and the other
must be figuratively understood.

When S. Cyprian in the forecited Epistle Epist. 63. Hoc quis veretur, ne per
saporem vini redoleat sanguinem Christi.
says, that some might make it an Objection, that by partaking of the Communion
early in the Morning, they might be discovered to the Heathen Persecutors by
the smell of the Wine, he expresses it thus, One fears this, lest by tasting
Wine he should smell of Christ's Blood.

S. Jerome has such another saying, which cannot well be mistaken to express
any other sense but ours, when speaking of Virgins Epist. ad Eustochium.
Ebrietati sacrilegium copulantes aiunt, absit ut ego me abstineam a sanguine
Christi.
that were reproved for drinking Wine to excess, he says, they made this
excuse, (joining sucrilege to their drunkenness) and said God forbid that I
should abstain from the Blood of Christ.

Either they said nothing to the purpose, or they took that which they called
the Blood of Christ, for Wine properly.

Thus also S. Chrysostom Epist. 1. ad Innocent. (...).
speaking of the rudeness of the Soldiers in the Church, says, that in the
tumult, the most holy Blood of Christ was shed upon the Soldiers Cleths. Which
could be nothing but Sacramental Wine.

Leo the Great, speaking of the Manichees, that for fear of the Laws came to
the Communion of the Catholics, and directing how to discover them, he says
Sermon. 4. de Quadrages. Ita in Sacramentorum communione se temperant, ut
interdum tutius lateant; Ore indigno Christi Corpus accipiunt, sanguinem autem
redemptionis nostrae haurire omnino declinant.
, They so behave themselves in the Communion of the Sacraments, that they may
sometime be more safely concealed; with an unworthy mouth they take the Body of
Christ, but altogether decline drinking the Blood of our redemption.

In the sense both of Leo and the Manichees, the Body and Blood here must be
taken figuratively; for such bad men as they, in the sense of the Ancients,
could not eat, or any way receive Christ's Body in a proper sense, but being
understood of the Type of it, viz. of the Sacramental Bread, that they would
receive; but not the Type of his Blood; viz. the Wine, because, as S. Austin De
Here Is. 46. Vinum non bibunt, dicentes fell esse principum tenebrarum.
observes, they drink no Wine, saying, it is the Gall of the Prince of
darkness. They had no more prejudice against the Blood than the Body of Christ,
only they took it to be Wine, which they abhorred.

3. Observe. The Fathers speak of Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist, with
such terms of restriction and diminution, which plainly tell us, that they
understood it not of his substantial and natural Body, but in a figurative
sense. Thus Origin Contr. Celsum l 8. p. 399. Edit. Cantabr. (...).
says, That Bread in the Eucharist is made by Prayer a certain holy Body.

And S. Austin In Psalm. 33. conc. 2. Accepit in manus quod norunt fideles and
ipse se portabat quodammodo, cum diceret hoc est Corpus meum.
, Christ took in his hands what the faithful understand, and after a sort,
carried himself when he said, This is my Body.

Bid In Psalm. 33. Christus quodammodo ferebatur in manibus suis.
upon the same Psalm, has the same term of restriction, Christ after a sort,
was carried in his own hands.

S. Austin elsewhere Epist. 23. ad Bonifac. Secundum quendam modum Sacramentum
Corporis Christi, Corpus Christi est; Sacramentum sanguinis Christ's, sanguis
Christi est.
, In a certain sense, the Sacrament of the Body of Christ is Christ's Body; and
the Sacrament of the Blood of Christ, is Christ's Blood. Just as at Easter we
say, this day Christ rose, because it is a memorial of it.

S. Chrysostom Epist. ad Caesarium. Dignus habitus est Dominici Corporis
appellatione.
says of the Consecrated Bread, That it has no longer the name of Bread (though
the nature of it remains) but is counted worthy to be called the Lord's Body.

Theoderet in like manner Dialog. 1. (...).
, He honored the visible Symbols with the appellation of (...) Body and Blood.

Facundus Hermian. In defens. 3. capit. l. 9. -- Non quod proprie Corpus cjus
sit panis, and poculum sanguis, etc.
is most express. We call, says he, the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, which
is in the Consecrated Bread and Cup, his Body and Blood; not that properly the
Bread is his Body, and the Cup his Blood, etc.

So also is S. Chrysostom In Gal. 5.17. Vol. 3. Savil. p. 755.
in another place; where he shows, that the word Flesh; is not always taken for
the (...), the nature and substance of the Body (which is the only proper
sense) and he gives other instances which are improper; (...)
as that flesh signifies a depraved will. (...)
And adds two other improper senses, in these words. By the name of Flesh, the
Scripture is wont also to call the mysteries; he adds also, that it calls the
Church so, when it calls it the Body of Christ.

The very phrase of being wont to call, shows, that of which it is affirmed to
be improperly so called, as the phrase of being thought worthy of the name (as
we heard before) argues the name not properly to agree to it.

4. Observe. The Fathers, knowing, that the Eucharist was not in a proper sense
Christ's Body, give us several reasons why it is called his Body. But no body
uses to give a reason why he calls a thing by its proper name. I shall not name
all the reasons here, but reserve some to another place; when we consider the
Sacrament, as a Sign, Figure, Type, Memorial, etc.

1. One reason they give is from its likeness and resemblance, either in
respect of what it consists of, or from the likeness of its effects.

S. Austin's saying is remarkable Epist. 23. Si Sacramenta quandam
similitudinem earum rerum non haberent quarum Sacramenta sunt, omnino
Sacramenta non essent. Ex hac autem similitudine plerunque etiam ip^arum rerum
nomina accipiunt.
, If the Sacraments had not a resemblance of those things of which they are
Sacraments, they would not be Sacraments at all: But from this resemblance they
take commonly the name even of the things themselves which they resemble.

Bid also gives In Cap. 6. Epist. ad Roman. Lib. 4. cap. 4. Forte dicis,
speciem sanguinis non video. Sed habet similitudinem. Sicut enim mortis
similitudinem sumpsisti, ita etiam similitudinem pretiosi sanguinis bibis, etc.
the same reason in his Commentary on the Romans.

The Author of the Book of Sacraments under S. Ambrose his name, speaks thus.
Thou may say perhaps, I do not see the substance of Blood. Well, but it has
its likeness. For as thou have received the likeness of his death, so thou
drinkest the likeness of his precious Blood.

S. Cyprian Epist. 76. ad Magnum. Quando Dominus Corpus suum panem vocat, de
multorum granorum adunatione congestum, populum nostrum quem portabat indicat
adunatum: and quando sanguinem suum vinum appellat de botris atque acinis
plurimis expressum atque in unum coactum, gregem item nostrum significat
commixtione adunatae multitudinis copulatam.
. When Christ called Bread, made up of many united grains of Corn, his Body, he
showed the unity of Christian people whom he bore; and when he called Wine
pressed out of many Grapes, and put together his Blood, he signified also the
uniting of a multitude of the Christian flock together.

So Rabanus Maurus De Instit. Cleric. c. 31. Propterea Dominus noster Corpus
and sanguinem suum in eis rebus commendavit, quae ad unum aliquid rediguntur ex
multis five granis five acinis, and Sanctorum Charitatis unitatem significaret.
. Therefore our Lord commended his Body and Blood in those things, which
consisting of many Grains or Grapes, are brought together into one, whereby he
might signify the unity of the Charity of Saints.

Others again from the likeness of its effects.

Thus Isidore of Sevil De Offic. Eccles. l. 1. cap. 18. Panis quia confirmat
Corpus, ideo Corpus Christi nuncupatur; vinum autem quia sanguinem operatur in
carne, ideo ad sanguinem Christi refertur.
. Bread, because it strengthens the Body, is therefore called the Body of
Christ; and Wine, because it produces Blood in the Flesh, is therefore referred
to the Blood of Christ.

The same reason is also given by Rabanus Maurus, in his Commentary upon the 26
Chap. of S. Matthew.

2 Reason. Another reason, why they call the Eucharist Christ's Body, is,
because it supplies the place, is instead of it, is its representative, its
pledge and pawn.

Tertullian Lib. 6. de Orat. Corpus ejus in pane censetur, Hoc est corpus meum.
. His Body is reputed to be in the Bread, This is my Body.

S. Austin Tract. 45. in Joan. Videte, fide manente, signa variata. Ibi Petra
Christus, nobis Christus quod in altari Dei ponitur.
. See how the signs are varied, Faith remaining the same. There (in the
Wilderness) the rock was Christ, to us that which is placed on Gods Altar is
Christ.

Again elsewhere more fully De Civit. Dei, l. 18. c. 48. Quodammodo omnia
significantia videntur rerum quas significant sustinere personas, sicut dictum
est ab Apostolo, Petra erat Christus, quoniam Petra illa de qua hoc dictum est,
significabat utique Christum.
. All things intended to signify, seem in a sort to sustain the persons of
those things which they signify, as the Apostle says, The Rock was Christ,
because that Rock of which this is spoken, did signify Christ.

Cyril of Jerusalem Catech. Mystag. 4. -- (...), etc.
says, Wherefore with all assurance, let us receive it ( viz. The Bread and
Wine) as the Body and Blood of Christ; for in the type of Bread his Body is
given thee, and in the type of Wine his Blood.

Proclus of Constantinople Orat. 18. -- (...).
. Instead of the Manger let us venerate the Altar; instead of the Infant let us
embrace the Bread that is blessed by the Infant, ( viz. Christ.)

Victor Antiochen. In Marc. 14. Citante Bulingero adv. Casaub.

(...).

(...).


When the Lord said, this is my Body, this is my Blood, it was fit that they
who set forth the Bread, should, after giving of thanks, reckon it to be his
Body, and partake of it, and account the Cup to be instead of his Blood.

The Author of the Commentaries attributed to S. Jerome In 1 Cor. 11. Ultimam
nobis commemorationem five memoriam dereliquit, quemadmodum si quis peregre
proficiscens, aliquod pignus ei quem diligit derelinquat, ut quotiescunque
illud viderit, possit ejus beneficia and amicitias memorare.
. Christ left to us his last remembrance, just as if a person taking a Journey
from home, should leave some pledge to one whom he loves, that as often as he
looked upon it, he might call to mind his kindnesses and friendships.

So also Amalarius De Offic. Eccles. l. 3. c. 25. Edit. Hittorpii, p. 425.
Christus, inclinato capite, emisit spiritum. Sacerdos inclinat se, and hoc quod
vice Christi immolatum est, deo Patri commendat.
. Christ bowing his head gave up the Ghost. The Priest bows himself, and
commends to God the Father this which is offered as a Sacrifice in the place of
Christ.

5. Observe. That although, for the Reasons given, the Fathers call the Sacrament
Christ's Body, yet they plainly say, that what is distributed in the Eucharist
is without any life or sense, which cannot be said of Christ's natural Body.

Epiphanius In Anchorat.

(...). -- (...) etc.

-- (...).


. We see what our Savior took in his hands (viz. Bread) and having given
thanks said, This is mine, and that; and yet we see, that it is not equal to it
nor like it, not to the incarnate Image, not to the invisible Deity, not to the
Lineaments of members; for this (the Bread) is of a round form, and insensible
as to any power.

Theophilus of Alexandria Epist. Paschal. 2. Non recogitat a juas in Baptismate
mysticas adventu Sp. Sancticonsecrari, panemque Dominicum, quo Salvatoris
Corpus ostenditur, and quen, frangimus in Sanctificationen, nostri, and S.
calicem, quae in mensa Ecclesiae collocantur, and utique inanima sunt, per
invocationem and adventum Spiritus S. sanctificari.
, discoursing against Origin, who did not believe that the H. Ghost did operate
upon things inanimate, says, He (Origin) does not remember, that the mystical
waters in Baptism are consecrated by the coming of the H. Ghost, and that the
Lords Bread, whereby the Body of our Savior is shown, and which we break for
our sanctification, and the H. Cup, which are all placed upon the Table of the
Church, and are indeed without life, yet are Sanctified by the Invocation and
advent of the H. Ghost.

S. Jerome Epist. ad Theoph. Alex. Ut discant qui ignorant cruditi testimoniis
Scripturarum, qua debeant veneratione Sancta suscipere and Altaris servitio
deservire; sacrosque calices and sancta velamina, and caetera quae ad cultum
pertinent Dominicae Passionis, non quasi inanima and sensu carentia
Sanctimoniam non habere, sed ex consortio corporis and sanguinis Domini, eadem
qua Corpus ejus and Sanguis Majestate veneranda.
commending the foresaid work, and admiring at the profit the Churches would
reap thereby, says, They they who are ignorant, being instructed by
Scripture-Testimonies, may learn, with what veneration they ought to meddle
with holy things, and serve at the Altar; and that the H. Chalices and H.
Veils, and the rest of the things that appertain to the Celebration of our
Lord's Passion, are not to be looked upon as having no sanctity, as being
without life and sense, but by reason that they accompany the Body and Blood of
our Lord, are to be venerated with the same majestic regard, that his Body and
Blood is.

6. Observe. That the Fathers speak of Divisions and parts of the Eucharist,
which cannot be truly said of the natural Body of Christ, which the Romans Church
confesses to be impassible, but only of the Sacramental Bread and Wine.

Cyprian Lib. de Lapsis. Quidam alius and ipse maculatus, sacrificio a
Sacerdote celebrato, partem cum caeteris ausus est latenter accipere, sanctum
Domini edere and contrectare non potuit.
. Another who was also defiled, the Sacrifice being Celebrated by the Priest,
was so bold, as privily to take a part of it with others, but he could not eat
and handle the Holy (Body) of the Lord.

Clemens Alexandr. Strom. l. 1. -- (...).
. When the Bishop, according to custom had divided the Eucharist, they suffered
every one of the people to take a portion of it.

Origin Hom. 13. in Exodum. Cum suscipitis Corpus Domini, cum omni cautela and
veneratione servatis, ne ex eo parum quid decidat, ne consecratimuneris aliquid
dilabatur, etc.
(if they be his genuine words) says, When ye receive the Lords Body, ye keep
it with all caution and veneration, lest any little portion of it should fall
down, lest any thing of the consecrated gift should slip down to the ground,
etc.

S. Basil Epist. 289. ad Caesariam.
showing, that they that have received the Communion in the Church may reserve
it, and Communicate themselves at home with their own hand, and that the
practice was thus in Alexandria and Egypt; adds, that when the Priest has
distributed the Sacrifice, he that receives it whole, (...)
and takes daily a part of that which was so given him, ought to believe that
he rightly receives it. -- It is the same in virtue, whether a person receive a
single part from the Priest, or many parts together.

S. Ambrose agrees with it, Epist. 1. ad Justum. Etsi parum sumas, etsi
plurimum haurias, eadem perfecta est omnibus mensura redemptionis.
speaking of the Blood of Christ. Whether thou take, says he, a little, or
drinkest a larger draught, there is the same perfect measure of redemption to
all.

So also S. Austin Epist. 59. ad Paulin. -- Ad. distribuendum comminuitur.
speaking of that upon the Lords Table which is blessed and sanctified, (which
is Bread) he says of it, that it is broken into little parts to be distributed.
Which cannot be said of Christ's proper Body.

And elsewhere Epist. 86. ad Casulanum. De agni immaculati corpore partem sumere.
his phrase concerning communicating is, to take a part from the body of the
immaculate Lamb.

Also in another place, he says De Verb. dom. sermon. 33. In accipiendo novimus
quid cogitemus, Modicum accipimus and in cord saginamur.
, In receiving we know what we think. We receive a little portion, and are
fatted at heart.

Cyril of Alexandria In Joan. 6.57. (...).
says, The least part of the Consecrated Bread (which he calls the Eulogy)
mingles the whole Body into it self, and fills it with its own energy, and thus
both Christ is in us, and we again are in him.

Eusebius Eccles. Hist. l. 6. c. 36. -- (...).
tells the story of the Presbyter, that when Serapion was a dying, sent him, by
a Boy, a little bit of the Eucharist.

And Prosper Dimidium temporis. c. 6. -- Brevem portiunculam Corporis Dominici.
has a like story of a possessed Woman, that received a short and small portion
of our Lords Body.

And P. Pius I, in an Epistle attributed to him (and made use of by Bellarmine
De Euchar. l. 2. cap. 5. Si quid de sanguine Domini stillaverit in terram.
) speaks of some of the Blood of Christ dropping and distilling on the ground,
and directs what is to be done in that case.

7. Observe. The Fathers speak of making the Body of Christ in the Eucharist, in
a sense quite different from that of the Romanists.

S. Jerome frequently uses the phrase of making Christ's Body, and speaking of
the Presbyters that succeeded to the Apostles, in one Epistle Epist. 1. ad
Heliodor. Qui Christi Corpus Sacro ore conficiunt.
he says, they make the Body of Christ with their Holy Mouth.

And in another Epistle Ad Evagrium. Ad quorum preces Christi Corpus sanguisque
conficitur.
says of them, That upon their Prayers the Body and Blood of Christ is made.

Also in a third Epistle Ad Fabiolam. Sequester Dei and hominum, and carnes
agni sacro ore conficiens.
he describes a Priest to be one that mediates betwixt God and Men, and one
that makes the flesh of the Lamb with his holy mouth.

Here now they of the Church of Rome take care to advance the Priesthood, though
even with words of Blasphemy. One cries out Stella Clericorum. Qui creavit me
sine me, creatur mediante me.
, He that created me without me, is created by my means.

So also Biel In Canon. Missae, Lect. 4. Qui creavit me (si fas est dicere)
dedit mihi creare se, and qui creavit me sine me, creatur mediante me.
. He that created me (if I may be bold to say it) has given me power to create
himself, and he that created me without me, is created by my means.

Biel also (in the same Lecture) makes a comparison between the Priests and the
Bl. Virgin, and makes them to carry it from her in this matter.

She by pronouncing eight words, Illa prolatis octo verbulis, Ecce Ancilla
Domini, fiat mihi secundum Verbum tuum, semel concepit Dei filium and mundi
Redemptorem. Isti a Domino consecrati, quinque Verbis eundem Dei Virginisque
filium advocant quotidie corporaliter. Attendite, O Sacerdotes, in quo gradu
and dignitate sitis constituti.
Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, etc. Conceived once the Son of God and the
Redeemer of the World. They (viz. the Priests) being consecrated by the Lord,
by speaking five words, do call the same Son of God, and the Virgin, bodily
before them every day. And then cries out. Consider, O Priests, in what high
degree and dignity you are placed.

But now the Fathers they sufficiently explain themselves, that this of making
Christ's Body, cannot be understood of the natural and proper Body of Christ. For

First, They lay it down as a Rule, that whatsoever is made, was not before it
was made.

Thus Athenagoras De resurrect. (...).
says, That which is already is not made, but that which is not.

Tertullian in like manner says Lib. contr. Hermog. cap. 19. Nihil quod fieri
habet sine initio est, quin initium sit illi dum incipit fieri.
Nothing that has a fieri, is without a beginning, but it begins to be while it
begins to be made.

Athanasius Contr. Arian. Orat. 3. (...).
It is the property of Creatures and works, that they are said to exist out of
non-entities, and not to be before they are made.

Greg. Nyssen Contr. Eunom. l. 9. (...).
. If he made it, he made that which was not at all.

S. Hilary De Trin. l. 12. Omne quod fit, antequam fiat non fuit.
. Every thing that is made, was not before it was made.

S. Ambrose De Incarn. l. 3. Quod fit incipit.
. That which is made begins to be.

S. Austin De moribus Manich. c. 7. Facere enim est quod omnino non erat.
. To make is true of that which was not at all.

Cyril Alexand. Thesaur. Assert. 20. (...).
. It cannot be, that what already exists, should be brought into being, but
what does not exist.

Vigilius also Lib. 3. cont. Eutychen. Fieri, ejus soleat esse proprium, qui
nunquam ante substiterat.
. To be made, is the usual property of him, who never subsisted before.

Cassianus also Lib. 7. de incarn. c. 2. Quae orta jam fuerint, redire in id
rursum non queant ut nova creatione generentur.
. Things already sprung up, cannot return into that state; that they should be
generated by a new creation.

These sayings do very ill accord with the Doctrine of the Roman Church
Catechis. ad Paroch. de Eucharist. n. 39. Sine ulla Domini nostri mutatione;
neque enim Christus aut generatur, aut mutatur, aut augescit.
, which teaches, that the Conversion in the Eucharist is made, without any
change in our Lord; for neither is Christ generated, or is changed, or
increased.

Secondly, They so speak of making Christ's Body, that it cannot be understood
of any other than his typical and mystical Body. For the Fathers say, That
Bread is made his Body.

Tertullian Cont. Ma^c. l. 4. c. 40. Acceptum panem and distributum discipulis,
Corpus suum illum fecit, hoc est Corpus meum dicendo.
. Christ when he had taken Bread, and distributed it to his Disciples, made it
his Body, saying, This is my Body.

Eusebius Demonst. Evang. lib. 8. (...).
. Christ commanded his Disciples (speaking of the Symbols of the Divine
Economy delivered to them, i. e. Bread and Wine) to make the image of his Body.

Cyril of Jerus. Catech. Mystag. 1. (...).
. When the Invocation is over, the Bread is made the Body of Christ, and the
Wine the Blood of Christ.

Greg. Nyssen Orat. in Christi Baptisma. (...).
says, At first the Bread is common Bread, but after the mystery has
consecrated it, it is called and is made the Body of Christ.

S. Austin Sermon. de diversis, 87. Non omnis panis, sed accipiens benedictionem
Christi, fit Corpus Christi.

Canon Miss. Quam oblationem tu Deus in omnibus, quaesumus, benedictam,
adscriptam, ratam, rationabilem, acceptamque facere digneris, ut nobis Corpus
and sanguis fiat dilectissimi tui filii Domini nostri J. Christi, etc.


. Not all Bread, but only that which receives Christ's blessing, is made the
Body of Christ.

Canon of the Mass. Which Oblation, O Almighty God, we beseech thee vouchsafe
to make blessed, allowable, firm, rational, and acceptable, that it may be made
to us the Body and Blood of thy most dear Son our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.

Also the Fathers say still more expressly, that the Body and Blood of Christ,
is made of Bread and Wine.

Thus the Author of the Book of Sacraments under S. Ambrose's name Lib. 4. de
Sacram. c. 4. Tu forte dicis, meus panis est usitatus: sed panis iste panis est
ante verba Sacramentorum, ubi accesserit consecratio de pane fit caro Christi.
. Perhaps thou will say, My Bread is usual Bread: but though that Bread be Bread
before the Sacramental words, yet upon Consecration, of Bread is made the Flesh
of Christ.

Gaudentius In Exodus trac. 2. Ipse naturarum Creator and Dominus, qui producit
de terra panem, de pane rursus, qui po^est and promisit, efficit proprium
corpus, and qui de aqua vinum fecit, and de vino sanguinem suum.
. The Creator and Lord of nature himself, who produces Bread out of the Earth,
of Bread again (seeing he is oble, and has promised it) he makes his own Body;
and he that of Water made Wine, made also of Wine his Blood.

Now all this can be meant of nothing else, but what we heard out of Eusebius
before, of the Image of his Body, which he commanded his Disciples to make.

S. Jerome also explains it of the Sacramental Bread and Wine, upon those words
of the Prophet In Jerem. 31.12. De quo conficitur panis Domini, and sanguinis
ejus impletur typus, and benedictio Sanctificationis ostenditur.
, They shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord, for Wheat, and for Wine
and Oil. He adds, Of which the Lords Bread is made, and the type of his Blood
is fulfilled, and the blessing of sanctification is shown.

And in another place In cap. 9. Zachar. De hoc tritico efficitur ille panis
qui de Coelo descendit and confortat cor hominis.
Of this Wheat the Bread that descended from Heaven is made, and which
strengthens the heart of man. Which must be understood of the Bread received in
the Eucharist.

So Tertullian Antea citat. Corpus suum illum (sc. panem) fecit, hoc est Corpus
meum dicendo, id est, Figura Corporis mei.
explains himself. He made Bread his Body, saying, This is my Body, That is,
the Figure of my Body.

And Leo Magn. Epist. 88. Nec licet Presbyteris nisi eo (sc. Episcopo) jubente,
Sacramentum Corporis and sanguinis Christi conficere.
. Neither may the Presbyters, without the Bishops Command, make the Sacrament
of the Body and Blood of Christ.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 29. in Genes. (...).
speaking of Wine, says, By this the matter of the good things for our
Salvation is perfected. Where by those good things, he plainly means the Wine
in the Eucharist.

It is also very observable, that the Fathers sometimes call this the mystical
Bread and Wine, and sometimes the mystical Body and Blood of Christ.

Thus S. Austin Contr. Faust. l. 20. c. 13. Noster panis and calix certa
consecratione, mysticus fit nobis, non nascitur.
says, Our Bread and Cup is made mystical to us, by a certain consecration, and
does not grow so.

S. Chrysostom De r^surrect. mort. Hom. 33. (...).
thus. The mystical Body and Blood is not made without the grace of the spirit.

When S. Ambrose Lib de iis qui initiant. c. 9. Hoc quod conficimus Corpus ex
Virgin est.

Sacramentum illud quod accipis sermon^ Christi conficitur.

Vera utique caro Christi quae crucifixa est, quae sepulta est. Vere ergo
car^is illius Sacramentum est.


had said, This Body which we make is of the Virgin. He explains this phrase by
another before it, viz. That Sacrament which thou receivest is made by the Word
of Christ. And also by another saying of his that follows. It was true Flesh of
Christ that was Crucified and buried; it is therefore truly the Sacrament of
his Flesh. Where you see he distinguishes these two, the Flesh of Christ
Crucified, and that in the Sacrament, which is only mystically so.

Hesychius In Levit. lib. 6. -- Corpore mystico non vescetur.
speaking of Jews, Pagans, and Heretics, says, that the Soul in Society with
them may not eat of the mystical Body, that is, of the Eucharist.

And elsewhere Id. ibid. lib. 2. Christus bibens ipse, and Apostolis bibere
dans sanguinem intelligibilem.
speaking of the Cup in the Sacrament, uses this phrase, Christ drinking
himself and giving to the Apostles the intelligible Blood to drink. Where
intelligible Blood is the mystical Blood in the Eucharist, according to his
constant use of that word.

Procopius of Gaza In Esa. cap. 3.
upon those words of the Prophet, of Gods taking away the Staff of Bread and
stay of Water; and telling us, that Christ's Flesh is meat indeed, and his Blood
drink indeed, which they that have not, have not the strength of Bread and
Water; he adds, there is another enlivening Bread also taken from the Jews,
(...)
etc. where he means the Eucharist, distinguishing it from Christ's proper Flesh
and Blood.

S. Ambrose De benedict. Patriarch. c. 9. Hunc panem dedit (Jesus) Apostolis,
ut dividerent populo credentium, hodieque dat nobis eum, quem ipse quotidie
sacerdos consecrat suis verbis. Hic panis factus est esca Sanctorum. Possumus
and ipsum Dominum accipere, qui carnem suam nobis dedit, sicut ipse ait, Ego
sum panis vitae.
makes the same distinction, where speaking of the Benediction of Asser, that
his Bread was fat, etc. and that Asser signifies riches; he adds, Jesus gave
this Bread to the Apostles, that they should divide it among believing people,
and he now gives it to us, being that which the Priest daily Consecrates with
his words. This Bread is made the food of Saints. We may also understand
thereby the Lord himself, who gave his Flesh to us, as he says, I am the Bread
of Life.

What can be more clear, than that he distinguishes here between the
Eucharistical Bread (which he calls the Saints food) and Christ himself the
Bread of Life?

8. Observe. The Fathers speak of Christ's Body sanctified and sacrificed in the
Eucharist; which cannot be understood of any thing, but his representative and
Typical Body.

S. Austin Epist. 59. Quod in Domini mensa est -- -- benedicirur and
sanctificatur.
speaking of that which is upon the Lords Table (which the Church of Rome will
have to be Christ's Natural Body) says, that it is blessed and sanctified.

And Gaudentius In Exodus tract. 19. Per singulas Ecclesiarum domos in mysterio
panis and vini reficit immolatus, vivificat creditus, consecrantes sanctificat
consecratus.
, speaking of Christ, whom he compares to the Paschal Lamb, says, Through all
the Houses of the Churches, in the mystery of Bread and Wine, being sacrificed
he refreshes, being believed on he quickens, being consecrated he sanctifies
them that consecrate.

This can be only true in representation, which is said of Christ's being
sacrificed and sanctified (or consecrated) by us; for the proper and natural
Body of Christ can neither be sanctified in a proper sense, nor sacrificed by
us, as I shall now show.

1. Not sanctified properly.
For this in the sense of the Fathers, is Dedication to God; and though we may
dedicate our selves to God, yet not the Son of God to him.

Origin In Levit. hom. 11. Sanctificare aliquid, hoc est, vovere Deo.
. To sanctify a thing, that is, to v^w it to God.

Cyril Alexandr. Com. in Esaiam. Edit. gr. lat. p. 178. (...).
. That which is said to be sanctified does not partake of all holiness, but it
rather signifies that which is devoted to God in honor of him. Now Christ is
certainly partaker of all Holiness.

Jobius Apud Photium, cod. 222. (...).
. We say a place, or Bread, or Wine is sanctified, which are set apart for God,
and are not put to any common use.

Hesychius In Levit. l. 7. Quod sanctificatur and offertur, eo quod offertur
Sanctificari incipit, ergo prius non erat sanctum.
. That which is sanctified and offered, because it is offered it begins to be
sanctified, therefore that it was not holy before. This cannot be affirmed of
Christ's proper Body, which was never other than holy, but may of the Typical
Bread which was common before.

2. Not sacrificed properly.
Therefore Gaudentius In Exodus tract. 19. Labores Passionis, etc. in figura
corporis and sanguinis offerimus.
in the forecited Tract, says, We offer the Labors, etc. Of the Passion, in
the Figure of the Body and Blood.

S. Austin Epist. 23. ad Bonifac. Nonne semel immolatus est Christus in seipso,
and tamen in Sacramento omni die populis immolatur?
. Was not Christ offered once in himself, and yet every day in the Sacrament he
is offered for the people?

He opposes, you see these two, to be Sacrificed in himself, (and that is but
once) and to be offered in the Sacrament, and that may be every day.

Also elsewhere In Psalm. 21. Praefat. in secundam expos. Quotiens Pascha
celebratur, nunquid totiens Christus moritur? Sed tamen anniversaria
recordatio, quafi repraesentat quod olim factum est, and sic nos facit moneri
tanquam videamus in cruce pendentem Dominum.
. Does Christ die so often as Easter is celebrated? Yet this Anniversary
remembrance, does as it were represent what was done of old, and so admonishes
us as if we saw our Lord hanging on the Cross.

And in the second Exposition it self, he says In secunda expos. Psalm. 21.
Coenam suam dedit, Passionem suam dedit.
. He gave us his Supper, and he gave us his Passion, viz. By representation.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 83. in Matthew. (...).
says the same; The mystery ( viz. the Eucharist) is the Passion and the Cross.

Which he explains thus elsewhere Hom. 17. in Epist. ad Hebr. (...).
. We always offer the same Sacrifice, or rather make a remembrance of (his)
Sacrifice.

So Eulogius of Alexandria Apud Photium cod. 280. (...).
, speaking of the tremendous mystery of Christ's Body, says, It is not the
offering of different Sacrifices, but the remembrance of that one Sacrifice
once offered.

Theodoret also fully In Epist. ad Hebr. 8.4. (...).
tells us, That it is manifest to those that are skilled in divine matters,
that we do not offer any other Sacrifice, but make a remembrance of that one
saving one.

S. Austin's words are also remarkable De civit. Dei, l. 17. cap. 5. in fine.
Manducare panem in N. Testamento est Sacrificium Christianorum.
To eat Bread in the N. Testament is the Sacrifice of Christians.

Eusebius Demonstr. Evan. l. 1. c. 10. (...).
speaking of Christ's Sacrifice offered for our Salvation, adds. He commanded
us to offer to God continually the remembrance instead of the Sacrifice. What
can be more plain?

S. Ambrose says De Offic. l. 1. cap. 48.
that Christ is offered here, but it is (in imagine) in an image, and he
opposes this to his offering himself (in veritate) in truth.

S. Austin Quaestion 83. quaest. 61 Ipse etiam Sacerdos noster qui seipsum
obtulit holocaustum pro peccatis nostris, and ejus Sacrificii similitudinem
celebrandam in suae Passionis memoriam commendavit.
says, Our Priest who offered himself an holocaust for our sins, also commended
the similitude of his Sacrifice to be celebrated in memory of his passion.

And elsewhere Contr. Faustum, l. 20. c. 21. Hujus Sacrificii caro and sanguis
-- Post ascensum Christi per Sacramentum memoriae celebratur.
. The Flesh and Blood of this Sacrifice -- after Christ's Ascension, is
celebrated by the Sacrament of remembrance.

Lastly, Fulgentius De fide ad Petrum, c. 16. Sacrificium panis and vini.
calls the Sacrifice, which the H. Catholic Church ceases not to offer through
the whole World, the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine; and says, that in this
Sacrifice, -- Gratiarum actio atque commemoratio est carnis Christi quam pro
nobis obtulit.
there is a thanksgiving and a commemcration of the Flesh of Christ which he
offered for us.

For want of apprehending things thus, they of the Church of Rome are tempted
to utter words bordering upon Blasphemy; and with Corn. a Lapide, Comm. in Heb.
7. v. 7. Add Sacerdotem quatenus gerit personam Christi Sacrificantis, quodam
modo majorem esse Christo ipso sacrificato. In omni enim Sacrificio sacerdos
major est sua victima quam offert.
to make their Sacrificing Priest greater than Christ the Sacrifice.

CHAP. VIII. The Eighth Difference. The Church of Rome in all Sayings of the
Fathers-that mention a Change and Conversion in the Eucharist, understand it of
such a Change as abolishes the Substance of Bread and Wine, the Accidents only
remaining: But the Fathers never use these Phrases in this Sense.
IT is acknowledged by us, That the Fathers speak frequently of a Change of the
Bread and Wine, and their passing into, and being converted into Christ's Body
and Blood. It is needless therefore to cite their Testimonies to this purpose;
but I shall evidently prove, that they do not understand this Change and
Conversion in the Sense of Transubstantiation.

To give some Order to their Testimonies, I shall not cite them in a heap, but
as Proofs of several Assertions of theirs, which overthrow the Change by
Transubstantiation.

1 Assertion. The Fathers make a difference betwixt the Change or Conversion of
a Thing, and its Abolition. When they affirm the one, they at the same time
deny the other. But Transubstantiation supposes the Elements, as to the Matter
and Substance of them, to perish and to be destroyed, when they are said to be
changed.

You cannot well imagine that the Fathers, if they thought of Miracles wrought
in the Sacrament, yet should ever dream of any such as had no agreement with
all the Miracles that God ever wrought before. They well knew, (and our
Adversaries do not deny it) that in all other Supernatural Changes, there was
only the introducing of a new Form, the Materia substrata (the common Matter)
remaining. So it was when Moses's Rod was turned into a Serpent, when the
Waters were turned into Blood, Lot's Wife into a Pillar of Salt, the Wine in
Cana of Galilee changed into Water; in all these, neither the old Matter was
lost, nor new Matter created. The Fathers therefore laugh at any such Change
where the Things changed utterly perish.

Tertullian De Resurrect. Carn. c. 55. Quasi demutari, sit in totum and de
pristino perire.
charges it as a great Absurdity against the Marcionites, that, according to
them, To be changed, was to perish whelly, and as to what they were before.

He has many smart Sayings against them, for denying the same Bodies to appear
and rise at the Resurrection; and urges that of 1 Cor. 15. showing that there
will be a Change, not a Destruction of our Flesh. For, says he, Aliud est
demutatio, aliud perditio. Peribit autem demutata, si non ipsa permanserit in
demutatione quae exhibita fuerit in resurrectione.
A Change is one thing, and Destruction is another. But it will perish in the
Change, if that Flesh do not remain in the Change which shall be exhibited at
the Resurrection.

-- As therefore that which is destreyed, -- Quomodo ergo quod perditum est,
mutatum non est, ita quod mutatum est perditum non est. Perisse enim, est in
totum non esse quod fuerit; mutatum esse, aliter esse est. Sed porro dum aliter
est, id ipsum potest esse; habet enim esse quod non perit; mutationem enim
passum est, non perditionem.
is not changed; so that which is changed, is not destroyed. For, to perish, is
wholly not to be what it had been; but to be changed, is to be otherwise than
it was. Moreover, by being otherwise, the thing may still be; for it has a
Being which perishes not; for it only suffered a Change, not a Destruction.

Gelasius De duabus Naturis.
also disputing against the Eutychians, who thought that the Humanity was
converted into the Divinity, so that nothing of the other remained, (just as
with them the Bread is converted into Christ's Body, Nec videatur glorificata
nostra conditio unione Deitatis, sed potius esse consumpta, si non eadem
subsistit in gloria, sed sola existente Deitate, humanitas illic esse jam
destitit, etc.
nothing of its Substance remaining) says thus: Neither does our Condition by
the Union of the Deity seem to be glorified, but rather to be consumed, if it
does not subsist the same in Glory, but the Deity existing alone, the Humanity
now ceases to be there, etc.

-- By this way, -- Per hoc non sublimata, sed abolita potius invenitur.
it will not be found to be sublimated, but abolished.

The thing is so clear against Transubstantiation, that Scotus In 4. did. 11.
art. 1. sec. ad propositum. Dico proprie loquendo, quod transubstantiatio non
est mutatio.
confesses it. I say, properly speaking, That Transubstantiation is not a
Change.

2 Assertion. When the Fathers speak of converting a thing into another thing
that was before, they suppose an Accession and an Augmentation made to that,
into which the Conversion is made. Just as it is in Nourishment of our Bodies,
the Food converted into them, makes an Increase of them.

Cyril. of Alexandr. Epist. 1. ad Succensum.
arguing against those Heretics who thought the glorified Body of Christ was
converted into his Divinity, he says, Thus we derogate from the Divinity, (...).

(...).


as if it were made, and as receiving something into it self, which is not
proper to its Nature. And he makes this Conversion to be impossible upon this
account.

Gelasius De duabus Naturis. -- Accesserit, accreveritque Deitati.
uses the same Phrases, of Accession and Increase to the Deity, and that by the
transfusion of the Humanity added to it, -- transfusione humanitatis adjectae
velut aucta videatur.
the Divinity would seem to be increased.

Thus the later Greeks thought it was in Christ's Body, into which the Bread
was changed.

Damascen Epist. ad Zachariam, and in Hom. de Corp. and Sang. Domini.
, speaking of the Body of Christ which we partake of: I declare, says he, it
cannot be said, -- (...).
there are two Bodies of Jesus Christ, there being but one alone. For, as the
Child, as soon as it is born, is complete, but receives his growth from eating
and drinking; and though he grows thereby, yet cannot be said to have two Bodies,
but only one; so, by greater reason, the Bread and Wine, by the Descent of the
Holy Spirit, are made one only Body, and not two, by the Augmentation of the
Body of Christ.

Theophylact In cap. 6. Joan.
expresses it thus: The Bread is changed ((...)) into the Flesh of Christ by
the ineffable Words, (...)
the mystical Benediction, and coming of the Holy Spirit upon it. No Man ought
to be troubled in being obliged to believe that Bread becomes Flesh: For when
our Lord was conversant in Flesh, and received his Nourishment from Bread, this
Bread he did eat was changed into his Body, being made like to his holy Flesh,
(...)
and contributed to augment and sustain it after a humane manner: And thus now
is the Bread changed into our Lord's Flesh.

See more Testimonies of the following Greeks in Monsieur Claude's Catholic
Doctrine of the Eucharist, in answer to Monsieur Arnaud, Lib. 3. cap. 13. page
228, 229. in Fol.

3 Assertion, (and the most remarkable) is this. The Fathers use the same Terms
of passing into, being changed, converted, becoming another thing, etc. in
other Cases besides the Eucharist, wherein all agree there is no Change of
Substances made. Therefore there is no Argument can be drawn from such
Expressions in favor of Transubstantiation, no not when the Word Nature or
Substance is expressed in the Change.

Tertullian De Resur. Carn c. 55. Si transfigurationem and conversionem in
transi^um substantiae cujusque defendis, ergo and Saul in alium virum conversus
de corpore suo excessit, etc.
has dashed this out of countenance, when he says to Marcion, If thou defendest
a Transfiguration and Conversion as far as the passing of the Substance of a
thing into another, then Saul, who was turned into another Man, went out of his
Body, etc.

-- Again, It Is possible to be changed, says he, Ibid. Ita and in
resurrectionis eventum mutari, converti, reformari licebit, cum salute
substantiae.
to be converted and reformed into what shall happen at the Resurrection, and
yet the Substance be preserved.

But this will more fully appear, by the Axioms the Fathers lay down, and by
the Instances they give.

Their Axioms are such as these.

Cyril. of Alexandr. Thesaur. Assert. 20. (...).
. For a thing to be made, does not always signify a change of Nature.

Cyril. of Jerus. Catech. Mystag. 5. (...).
. Whatsoever the Holy Spirit touches, that is always sanctified and changed.

S. Jerome In cap. 43. Ezekiel. Per ignem Spiritus sancti omnia quae cogitamus,
loquimur ac facimus in spiritualem substantiam convertuntur.
. By the Fire of the Holy Spirit, all that we think, speak, and act, are
changed into a Spiritual Substance.

If these Sayings be strictly scanned, they will amount to no more than a
producing new Virtues and Qualities, which were not before.

Their Instances also show the same.

1. Of Miraculous Changes in Nature.
S. Ambrose In Hexem. l. 3. c. 2. Discant naturam posse converti, quando petra
aquas fluxit, and ferrum aquae supernatavit.
. Let them learn, that Nature may be converted, when the Rock flowed out
Waters, and Iron swam above Water.

Again Lib. de iis qui initiant. c. 9. Nonne claret naturam vel maritimorum
fluctuum vel fluvialis cursus esse mutatam? -- Misit Moses lignum in aquam and
amaritudinem suam aquarum natura deposuit. -- Mifit etiam Elisaeus lignum in
aquam, and ferrum natavit; utique and hoc praeter naturam factum esse
cognoscimus.
, speaking of Changes in the Red Sea and Jordan, when the Waters stood on an
heap; Is it not clear, says he, that the Nature of the Sea-waves and the Rivers
Current was changed? -- Moses threw Wood into the Water, and the Nature of the
Waters lost its Bitterness. -- Elisha also threw Wood into the Water, and Iron
swam; and this we know was done besides Nature.

Epiphanius Haeres. 64. (...).
says, The Hand of Moses was changed into Snow.

S. Chrysostom In Psalm. 10. (...).
(speaking of the Babylonian Furnace) says, The Elements forgetting their
proper Nature, were changed to become profitable to them; and the very Beasts
were no longer Beasts, nor the Furnace a Furnace.

2. Of the Change by the Fall.
S. Austin says In Psalm. 68. Conc. 1. Per iniquitatem homo lapsus est a
substanta in qua factus est.
, By Sin Man fell from the Substance in which he was made.

3. Of the Change by Regeneration.
Gr. Nyssen In Cantic. Hom. 1. (...).
says, That by the Discipline of Christ Men are changed into a Nature that is
more Divine.

And again In Cantic. Hom. 9. (...).
. Having divested themselves of Flesh and Blood, and being changed into a
Spiritual Nature.

Macarius Hom. 44. (...).
says, Our Souls must be altered and changed from their present Condition, into
another Condition, and into a Divine Nature.

Cyril of Alexandria De S. Trin. Dial. 3. (...).
speaks of Regeneration as that which transmutes and changes us into the Son of
God.

4. Of the Change in the Incarnation of Christ, and the Resurrection.
Gr. Nyssen Contr. Eunom. l. 2. (...).
, speaking of Christ, whom he calls our First Fruits, says, That by his mixing
with God, he is changed into a Divine Nature.

And again Ibid. l. 5. (...).
he uses this Phrase of Christ's Flesh, That this is also changed into the
Deity.

Chrysologus Sermon. 45 Deus in hominem convertitur.
of the Incarnation; God is changed into Man.

The Author under the Name of Eusebius Emissenus Hom. de Pasch. 3. Quid est
Virga in Serpentem? Deus in hominem commutatus.
asks, What is the Rod turned into a Serpent? He answers, God changed into Man.

Tertullian Demutati in atomo crimus in Angelicam substantiam. Contr. Marc. l.
3. c. ult.
, speaking of the Resurrection; We shall be changed in a moment into an
Angelical Substance.

S. Hilary's In Psalm. 138. Demutatio terrenorum corporum in spiritualem
aethereamque naturam.
Phrase of it is, A Change of Earthly Bodies into a Spiritual and Ethereal
Nature.

Macarius Hom. 34. (...).
speaking of the Saints; They are all changed into a Divine Nature.

Chrysologus Sermon. 45. Veniat, veniat ut carnem reparet, animam innovet, ipsam
naturam in coelestem commutet substantiam.
, speaking of Christ; Let him come, let him come, to repair our Flesh, make our
Souls new, change our Nature into a Celestial Substance.

Cyril of Alexand. says Orat. in Resurr. Christi. (...).
At the Resurrection there will be another kind of Life, and a Change of our
very Nature.

S. Austin Sermon. 12. de 40. a Sirmond. Edit. Caro mortalis convertitur in
corpus Angeli. -- Ille qui potens fuit mutare aquam in vinum, potens est mutare
foenum in aurum, and de carne facere Angelum. Si de sordibus fecit hominem, de
homine non faciet Angelum?
says, Our mertal Fesh is converted into the Body of an Angel. -- He that could
change Water into Wine, is able to change Hay (so he calls our Bodies that are
Grass) into Gold, and of Flesh make an Angel. If he made of Filth a Man, can he
not make of Man an Angel?

And elsewhere Cont. Adimant. c. 12. Cum induerit incorruptionem and
immortalitatem, jam non caro and sanguis erit, sed in corpus coeleste mutabitur.
, speaking of our Bodies; When it shall put on Incorruption and Immortality,
now it will be no longer Flesh and Blood, but be changed into a celestial Body.

Cassian. De Incarn. l. 3. c. 3. Natura carnis in spiritualem est translata
substantiam.
(speaking of Christ's Flesh after the Resurrection;) The Nature of his Flesh
is changed into a spiritual Substance.

5. Of the Change in Baptism.
S. Chrysostom In Acta, Hom. 23. (...).
. Verily the Power of Baptism is great, etc. it does not suffer Men to be any
longer Men.

Nazianzen Ocat. 40. (...).
. I am changed into Christ in Baptism.

Cyril of Alexandr. In Joan. 3.5. (...).
. By the energy of the Spirit the sensible Water is changed into a kind of
divine and unspeakable Power.

Again Idem Epist. ad Letorum. (...).
, That they are transelemented by Regeneration, through the Grace of the Laver
of Baptism.

S. Austin Cont. Crescon. lib. 4. c. 54. Uno die tria, alio quinque millia
credentium in suum corpus conversa suscepit.
, speaking of Baptized Converts to Christianity. It received on one day Three,
on another Five thousand Believers converted into his Body.

Again In Joan. tract. 11. Unde rubet Baptismus nisi sanguine Christi
consecratus?
elsewhere he asks, How comes Baptism to be red, but by being consecrated with
the Blood of Christ?

Leo the Great Scrm. 14. de Passione. Susceptus a Christo, and Christum
suscipiens, non idem est post Lavacrum qui ante baptismum feit, sed corpus
regenerati sit caro crucifixi; haec commutatio dextrae est excelsi, etc.
. He that is received by Christ, and receives Christ, is not the same Man after
as before Baptism; but the Body of the Regenerate Person becomes the Flesh of
Christ crucified; this is a Change by the Right hand of the most High, etc.

And again De Nativ. Dom. Sermon. 4. Christus dedit aquae quod dedit matri:
virtus enim altissimi and obumbratio Spiritus S. quae fecit ut Maria pareret
Salvatorem, eadem facit ut regeneret unda credentem.
. Christ gave to the Water, what he gave to his Mother: For the Virtue of the
most High, and the Overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, which made Mary to bring
forth a Savior, the same makes the Water to regenerate a Believer.

[Where we may also note by the way, That the mention of God's Omnipotence in
the Case of Sacraments, does not infer a substantial Change made there, since
it does not do it in Baptism; and yet the Omnipotency of God is seen in working
Changes there.]

Zeno Verenens. Ad Neoph. post Baptism. Sermon. 2. Aqua nostra suscipit mortuos
and evomit vivos, ex animalibus veros homines factos, ex hominious in Angelos
transituros.
. Our Water receives the Dead and vomits forth the Living, being made true Men
of mere Animals, such as are to pass from being Men into Angels, etc. He says
this of Baptism, which is not like common Water, which receives the Living to
the bottom, and vomits forth the Dead.

Author sub nomine Eusebii Emisseni Hom. 2. de Epiphan. Mutantur subito aquae,
homines postmodum mu^aturae.
. The Waters are suddenly changed, which are afterward to change Men, viz.
that are baptized in them.

Again Id. Hom. 3. de Epiph. Homo per aquam baptismi, licet a foris idem esse
videatur intus tamen alter efficitur -- persona non contingitur, and natura
mutatur.
. A Man by the Water of Baptism, though outwardly he seems the same, yet inwardly
he is made another Man. -- The Person is not touched, and Nature is changed.

Again Idem Hom. 5. de Pasch. In exteriore nihil additum est, and totum in
interiore mutatum est. -- In illam primae originis dignitatem nativo candore
mutatur, ac per aquam Baptismi, vel per ignem Spiritus S. aeterni illius panis
corpus efficitur.
. Nothing is added to what is outward, and he is wholly changed in what is
inward. -- He is changed by a native Whiteness into the Dignity of his first
Original; and by the Water of Baptism, or by the Fire of the Holy Spirit, is
made the Body of that eternal Bread.

4 Assertion. The Change in the Eucharist which the Fathers so often mention,
is either a Change into a Sacrament, or a Change of Efficacy and Virtue, by
infusion and addition of Grace.

What can be plainer (as to the first) than that of Isidore of Sevil De Offic.
Eccles. l. 1. c. 18. Haec duo sent visibilia, sanctificata autem per Spiritum
S. in Sacramentum divini corporis transeunt.
? Speaking of the Bread and Wine, he says, These two are visible; but being
sanctified by the Holy Spirit, they pass into a Sacrament of his divine Body.

As for the Change of Virtue and Efficacy, take these following Testimonies,
among many others.

Theodot us Epitom. ad fin. Operum Clem. Alex. (...).
. The Bread and Oil are sanctified by the Power of the Name, not being the same
they were according to appearance when taken, but are changed powerfully into a
Spiritual Virtue. The like he says of the Water in Baptism, That it not only
retains the less (that is, the Substance of Water) but also has Sanctification
added to it.

Epiphanius also In Compendio de Fide Eccles. (...).
speaks the same. Here in Christ the virtue of Bread and force of Water are
strengthened; not that the Bread is thus powerful to us, but the Virtue of the
Bread (which Christ puts into it). For Bread is indeed an Aliment, but there is
in it a Virtue to enliven us.

Cyril of Alexandr. Apud Victor. Antioch. Com. MS. in Marc. 14. (...).
. God condescending to our Infirmities, indues the Oblations set before us with
a Virtue of Life, and changes them into the Efficacy of his Flesh.

And in the forecited place of his Comment upon John In Joan. 6.57.
he says, The least particle of the Eucharist mixing it self with our whole
Body, (...)
fills it with its own Efficacy, etc.

Theodoret Dialog. 1.
tells those that partake of the Divine Mysteries, That they must not consider
the Nature of the Things seen, but upon the change of Names, (...)
believe the change made by Grace. And he adds, That Christ honored the
visible Symbols with the Name of his Body and Blood, -- (...).
not changing the Nature (or Substance) of them, but adding Grace to Nature.

Theophylact In cap 14. Marc. (...).
also says the same; Our Lord preserves the Substance ((...), the same with
(...) in Theodoret) of Bread and Wine, but changes them into the Virtue of his
Flesh and Blood.

Greg. Nyssen Orat. in Bapt. Christi.
, speaking of the Privileges which Consecration advances things to, instances
first in the Water of Baptism, and the great and mavelous Efficacy thereof;
and proceeds to that of an Altar, which is at first but a common Stone, but
after Dedication becomes an Holy Altar, which the Priests only touch with
Veneration: And then adds the Instance of the Eucharist, (...)
which at first is common Bread, but after the Mystery has consecrated it, it
is called and becomes the Body of Christ. So the mystical Oil, and so the Wine
before the Benediction, are things of little worth; but after the
Sanctification of the Spirit, each of them operates excellently.

So Ammonius Catena in Joan. 3.5. (...).

-- Ibid. (...).


says, The sensible Water is transelemented into a Divine Virtue (for the
Fathers make Changes in Baptism as well as the Eucharist) and sanctifies those
in whom it is. Nay, he affirms, That the Water differs only from the Spirit in
our manner of Conception, for it is the same in Energy.

Cyril of Jerusalem Catech. Mystag. 1. (...).
calling the Flesh and Bread in the Feast of Idols defiled, by the Invocation
of impure Devils, he illustrates it thus. As the Bread and Wine of the
Eucharist, before the Invocation of the adored Trinity, (...)
is bare Bread and Wine; but after Invocation, the Bread is made the Body of
Christ, (...)
and the Wine the Blood of Christ; so also in the same manner those Meats of
the Pomp of Satan, in their own Nature being simple things, yet by the
Invocation of Devils they become impure.

That Is the Change here, That those Meats are in Quality (not in Substance)
made impure; and so (if the Comparison hold) the Change in the other is, That
they are Hallowed Bread and Wine, in Use and Efficacy different from what they
were before.

The Author under Cyprian's Name De Vnct. Chrysmat. Inest Veritas signo, and
Spiritus Sacramento.
, speaking of Chrysin, says, Truth is in the Sign, and the Spirit in the
Sacrament.

Thus S. Ambrose De iis qui init. c. 9. in fine
understands the Body of Christ for that Divine Substance and Presence of the
Spirit (which is the (...) and (...) of Christ's Body). In illo Sacramento
Christus est, quia corpus est Christi. Non ergo corporalis esca, sed spiritalis
est. Corpus enim Dei corpus est Spiritale. Corpus Christi, corpus est divini
Spiritus, quia Spiritus Christi (sc. est.)
Christ is in that Sacrament, because it is the Body of Christ. It is not
therefore Corporeal but Spiritual Food: For the Body of God is a Spiritual
Body. The Body of Christ is the Body of the Divine Spirit (not his natural
Body) because it is the Spirit of Christ.

Here Corpus Dei is Corpus Spiritale, that is, Substantia Spiritalis, and
Spiritus.

The Author under his Name De Sacram. lib. 4. cap. 4. Quomodo potest qui panis
est, corpus esse Christi? Consecratione. -- Ergo ut tibi respondeam, Non erat
corpus Christi ante consecrationem; sed post consecrationem, dico tibi, quod
corpus est Christi. Ipse dixit, and factum est; ipse mandavit, and creatum est.
Tu ipse eras vetus creatura; posteaquam consecratus es nova creatura esse
coepisti, etc.
. How can that which is Bread be the Body of Christ? By Consecration. -- To
answer thee therefore, It was not the Body of Christ before Consecration; but
after Consecration, I tell thee, it is the Body of Christ. He said it, and it
was done; he commanded, and it was created. Thou thy self wast an old Creature;
but after thou wast consecrated, thou beganst to be a new Creature, etc.

So that, according to this Author, as in Regeneration by Baptism Man changes
his Nature, so does the Consecrated Bread in the Eucharist change its Nature.
Therefore it is no substantial Change, because the other confessedly is not so.

Druthmarus Comm. in Matthew. 26.
, speaking of a Person taking a long Journey, and leaving a Pledge behind him
to remember him by, -- Ita Deus praecipit agi a nobis, transferens
spiritualiter panem in corpus, vinum in sanguinem, ut per haec duo memoremus
quae fecit pro nobis de corpore suo, etc.
he adds, Thus also God has commanded us to do, spiritually changing the Bread
into his Body, and the Wine into his Blood, that by these two things we may
remember what he has done for us with his Body and Blood, etc.

5 Assertion. The Fathers express in the same manner, and as fully, our
substantial Change into Christ's Body, as of the Bread into Christ's Body. Yet
none will from such Expressions assert the former; and there is the same reason
not to do the latter.

Gr. Nyssen Orat. Catech. cap. 37. (...).
. As a little Leaven, according to the Apostle, likens the whole Mass to it
self; so the Body (of Christ) put to death by God, coming into our Body, does
change and convert the whole into it self.

And again, -- (...).
a little after. His immortal Body being in him that receives it, changes the
whole into its own Nature.

Cryil of Alexandria In Joan. lib. 4. cap. 3.
says, He that receives me by a participation of my Flesh, shall have Life in
himself, -- (...).
being wholly transelemented into me.

P. Leo Magn. De Not. Dom. Sermon. 10. Christi caro de utero virginis sumpta, nos
sumus.
. We are the Flesh of Christ, taken from the Womb of the Virgin.

And elsewhere Id. de Passion. Sermon. 14. Non aliud agit Participatio corporis
and sanguinis Christi, quam ut in id quod sumimus transeamus. -- Ipsum per
omnia spiritu and carne gestemus.
. The Participation of the Body and Blood of Christ intends nothing else but
that we should pass into that which we receive. -- That we may carry him in all
things both in Spirit and Flesh. (Not as Bellarmine and others pervert the
Sense, reading gustemus.)

Again, in another place Epist. 23. In illa mystica distributione spiritualis
alimoniae, hoc impertitur, hoc sumitur, ut accipientes virtutem coelestis cibi
in carnem ipsius, quia caro noitra factus est, transeamus.
. In that mystical Distribution of Spiritual Food, this is bestowed on us, this
is taken, that receiving the Virtue of the Celestial Meat, we should pass into
his Flesh, who was made our Flesh.

See more Testimonies to this sense inthe Chapter following, Position 3.

CHAP. IX. The Ninth Difference. The Fathers differ from the Church of Rome, in
their Belief of Christ's Presence in the Eucharist. The Church of Rome asserts
the substantial Presence of Christ's Natural Body there; but the Fathers deny
it.
THe former is the Assertion of the Roman Church in the Trent Council, in which
an Anathema is pronounced Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. cap. 6. Can. 1.
against such as deny, That in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist is contained
truly, really, and Substantially the Body and Blood of Christ, -- but shall
say, That he is in it only as in a Sign, or Figure, or Virtue. And the
Catechism ad Parochos Part. 2. de Eucharist. n. 25.
says, That the True Body of our Lord Christ, the same that was born of the
Virgin, and sits in the Heavens at the Right Hand of the Father, is contained
in this Sacrament.

I will now show, that the Fathers advance such Positions as plainly contradict
this Doctrine.

1 Position. The Fathers ever since Christ's departure and Ascension into
Heaven, look upon his Body as absent from Earth, though in another sense he is
still present.
All those Testimonies before produced under the Fifth Difference, concerning
Bodies being commensurate to Space, and not being in more places than one, and
saying this of Christ's Body as well as of other Bodies, are a Proof of this
Position; but besides those, I will here add some further direct Proofs of it.

S. Ambrose thus Com. in Luc. 24. Ascend nobis, ut te sequamur mentibus, quem
oculis videre non possumus, etc.

-- Ergo non supra terram, nec in terra, nec secundum carnem quaerere te
debemus, si volumus invenire. Nunc enim secundum carnem non novimus Christum.

-- Maria quia quaerebat in terra, tangere non potuit; Stephanus tetigit, quia
quasivit in coelo. Stephanus inter Judaeos vidit absentem.


. Ascend (speaking to Christ) that we may follow thee with our Minds, whom we
cannot see with our Eyes. S. Paul has taught us how we should follow thee, and
where we may find thee. Seek those things that are above, where Christ sits,
etc. -- Therefore we ought not to seek thee upon Earth, nor in the Earth, nor
according to the Flesh, if we would find thee. -- Mary could not touch him,
because she sought him on Earth: Stephen touched him, because he sought him in
Heaven. Stephen among the Jews saw him absent.

S. Austin is so copious in this Argument, and his Testimonies so many, that a
good Choice of them is only necessary. Thus he says Sermon. 140. de Tempore. Ideo
Dominus noster absentavit se corpore ab omni Ecclesia, and ascendit in coelum,
ut fides aedificetur: si enim non nosti nisi quod vides, ubi est fides?
. Therefore our Lord absented himself from every Church, and ascended into
Heaven, that our Faith may be edified; for if thou know nothing but what
thou see, where is Faith?

Again Sermon. 60. de Verb. Dom. Semper quidem Divinitate nobiscum est, sed nisi
corporaliter abiret a nobis, semper ejus corpus carnaliter videremus, and
nunquam spiritualiter crederemus.
. Christ is always with us by his Divinity; but unless he were corporally
absent from us, we should always carndly see his Body, and should never
spiritually believe.

This is a clear Testimony, that Christ is absent as to his Natural Body; and
that if it were not so, he would be visible to us still.

Again Tract. 50. in Joannem. Loquebatur de praesentia corporis sui: nam
secundum Majestatem suam, secundum Providentiam, secundum ineffabilem and
invisibilem Gratiam, impletur quod ab eo dictum est, Ecce ego vobiscum omnibus
diebus, etc. Secundum carnem vero quam assumpsit, secundum id quod de Virgin
natus est, etc. non semper habebitis me vobiscum.
, expounding those words, The Poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not
always; He spoke this, says he, concerning the Presence of his Body: For
according to his Majesty, according to his Providence, according to his
unspeakable and invisible Grace, that is fulfilled which he said, Behold I am
always with you, etc. But according to the Flesh which he assumed, according to
what was born of the Virgin, etc. (directly contrary to the Trent Catechism) ye
shall not have me always with you.

And in another place Sermon. 120. de diversis. Secundum praesentiam
pulchritudinis and divinitatis suae semper cum patre est; secundum praesentiam
corporalem jam supra coelos ad dextram patris est; secundum praesentiam vero
fidei in omnibus Christianis est.
. According to the beautiful Presence of his Divinity, he is always with the
Father; according to his corporal Presence he is now above the Heavens, at the
right hand of the Father (he forgot to add, and in the Holy Sacrament) but
according to the Presence of Faith, so he is in all Christians.

What can be more plain than another Saying of his Sermon. 74. de diversis.
Credimus in eum jam sedentem ad dextram patris; sed tamen quamdiu sumus in
corpore peregrinamur ab co; nec cum dubitantibus, vel negantibus and
dicentibus, Vbi est Deus tuus, valemus oftendere.
? We believe on him who sits now at the right hand of the Father; but yet
whilst we are in the Body, we are absent as in a strange Country from him; nor
can we show him to those that doubt, to those that deny him, and say, Where is
thy God?

If S. Austin had believed, as the Roman Church does, the Corporal Presence of
Christ in the Eucharist, he could have pointed to him upon the Altar, if any
had asked, Where is thy God?

Cyril of Alexandria In Joan. 9.5. (...).
says, Though Christ be absent from the World as to his Flesh, yet he is present
to those that are in him, and to the whole Universe, by his Divine and
Ineffable Nature; neither is he absent from any Creature, nor distant from any,
but is every where present to all, and fills the whole Universe.

And elsewhere In Joan. 17.12.
, speaking of the Disciples, who thought it a great loss to them, that being
taken up to Heaven, he would now be absent according to his Flesh; he says,
They ought not only to have respected and looked to his Fleshly Presence, (...)
but to have understood, that though he was separated from their Society
according to the Flesh, nor could be seen by their bodily Eyes, yet that he was
present and assistant always by the Power of his Divinity.

Fulgentius Ad Trasimund. l. 2. c. 17. Unus idemque secundum humanam
substantiam, absens coelo cum esset in terra, and derelinquens terram cum
ascendisset in coelum. Secundum Divinam vero immensamque substantiam nec coelum
dimittens, cum de coelo descendir, nec terram deserens cum ad coelum ascendit.
. One and the same (Christ) according to his Humane Substance, was absent from
Heaven when he was upon Earth, and left Earth when he ascended up to Heaven;
but according to his Divine and Immense Substance, neither left Heaven when he
descended from Heaven, nor forsook Earth when he ascended into Heaven.

Again Id. ibid. c. 18. Quomodo corporaliter ascendit in coelum, and in suis
fidelibus praedicatur effe in terra, si non est in illo divinitatis immensitas
quae coelum implere possit and terram?
. How did he corporally ascend into Heaven, and yet is said to be in the
Faithful on Earth, unless the Immensity of the Divinity be in him, which can
fill Heaven and Earth? Yes, a Romanist would have told him of another way, That
even his Body could be present in Heaven and Earth, after the manner of a
Spirit.

Vigilius Taps. Contr. Eutych. l. 1. Hoc crat ire ad patrem and recedere a
nobis, auferre de mundo naturam quam susceperat a nobis. -- Nam vide miraculum,
vide utriusque proprietatis mysterium, Dei filius secundum humanitutem suam
recessit a nobis, secundum divinitatem suam ait nobis, Ecce vobiscum sum
omnious diebus, etc. -- Quos reliquit and a quibus decessit humanitate sua, non
reliquit nec deseruit divinitate sua.
. This was to go to the Father and recede from us, to take from the World the
Nature that he had taken from us. -- For see the Miracle, see the Mystery of
both (Natures) distinct (not a Word of the Mystery of a Body being in more
places than one); The Son of God according to his Humanity departed from us;
according to his Divinity he says to us, Behold I am with you always, etc. --
Those whom he left and departed from by his Humanity, he did not leave nor
forsake by his Divinity.

Again Id. ibid. l. 4. Quando in terra fuit, non erat utique in coelo, and nunc
quia in coelo est non est utique in terra, etc. -- Quia verbum ubique est, caro
autem ejus ubique non est, apparet unum eundemque Christum utriusque esse
naturae, and esse quidem ubique secundum naturam divinitatis suae, and loco
contineri secundum naturam humanitatis suae.

-- Haec est Fides and Confessio Catholica, quam Apostoli tradiderunt, Martyrs
roborarunt, and Fideles nunc usque custodiunt.


. When Christ was on Earth, he was not in Heaven; and now because he is in
Heaven, he surely is not on Earth, etc. -- Because the Word is every where, but
his Flesh is not every where, it appears plainly, that one and the same Christ
is of both Natures, and that he is every where according to the Nature of his
Divinity, and contained in a Place according to the Nature of his Humanity
(which would be a bad Argument, if his Body were in Heaven and in the Eucharist
at the same time). And then he concludes, This is the Catholic Faith and
Confession, which the Apostles delivered, the Martyrs confirmed, and the
Faithful now still keep and preserve.

Leo Magn. Sermon. 2. de Ascens. Dom. Christus coram. Discipulis elevatus in
coelum, corporalis praesentiae modum fecit.
. Christ being raised up to Heaven in sight of his Disciples, he put an end to
his bodily Presence. (So he explains it, that he was to remain at the
Right Hand of his Father, till he should come again to judge the Quick and
Dead.)

Bid Com. in Marc. 13. Christus ad Patrem post resurrectionem victor
ascendens, Ecclesiam corporaliter reliquit, quam tamen nunquam divinae
praesidio praesentiae destituit, manens in illa omnibus diebus usque ad
consummationem seculi.
. Christ ascending after his Resurrection into Heaven as a Conqueror, left the
Church as to his bodily Presence, which yet he never left destitute of the
security of his Divine Presence, remaining in the Church always to the end of
the World.

This may abundantly suffice to prove the First Position.

2 Position. The Fathers distinguish the Presence of Christ's Body from the
Sacrament of it, which they make to be a Memorial and Pledge of Christ, as gone
away and absent.
S. Chrysostom In 1 Cor. 11.29.
, expounding those words, He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and
drinks judgment; and asking how that Table, which is the Cause of so many
good things, (...)
and flows with Life, should be made Cordemnation to any, resolves it thus;
That this happens not from its own Nature, (...)
but from the Purpose of him that approaches this Table. For, says he, as
Christ's Presence, which brought those great and unspeakable Blessings to us,
did condemn those the more that did not receive it; so also the Mysteries-make
way for greater Punishments to these that unworhily partake of them. A
remarkable Testimony, because we see he distinguishes the Presence of Christ,
from the Sacrament of it; compares the one with the other, and because of the
Relation that the Mysteries have to Christ, and that both are intended to
convey great Blessings, therefore they both, when unworthily treated, occasion
greater Punishments.

S. Austin Contr. Faust. l. 20. c. 21. Hujus sacrificii caro and sanguis ante
adventum Christi per victimas similitudinum promittebatur, in passione Christi
per ipsam veritatem reddebatur, post ascensum Christi per Sacramentum memoriae
celebratur.
. The Flesh and Blood of this Sacrifice, before Christ's coming, was promised
by Victims of Resemblance, in the Passion of Christ it was exhibited in the
Truth it self; after Christ's Ascension it is celebrated by the Sacrament of
Remembrance. Where you see, the Sacrament of Remembrance is opposed to the
Exhibition of the Truth.

Author Comm. in Epistolas Pauli (inter Hieronymi Opera) In 1 Cor. 11. Hoc est,
benedicens etiam passurus, ultimam nobis commemorationem five memoriam
dereliquit. Quemadmodum si quis peregre proficiscens, aliquod pignus ei quem
diligit derelinquat, ut quotiescunque illud viderit, possit ejus beneficia and
amicitias memorari; quod ille si perfect dilexit, sine ingenti desiderio non
possit videre, vel fletu.
, upon those words, He took Bread, and after he had given thanks, he brake it:
That is, says he, blessing us even when he was about to suffer, he left his
last Memorial with us. Just as if one traveling into another Country, should
leave a Pledge with him whom he loved, that whenever he looked upon it, he
might call to mind his Favors and Friendship; which such a Person, if he
perfectly loved him, could not behold without a great passion or weeping.

It will be very hard to reconcile this Pledge of Absence with such a constant
Presence of his Body as the Church of Rome teaches, even there where we are
required to look upon that Pledge, and remember our absent Friend. Sedulius has
the same Exposition of the Place, almost in the same words.

Primasius also confirms it In 1 Cor. 11.
, upon those words, The same night that our Lord was betrayed, he took Bread.
He left, says he, Ultimam nobis commemorationem reliquit. -- Salvator Deus
exemplum dedit, ut quotiescunque hoc facimus, in mente habeamus, quod Christus
pro nobis omnibus mortuus est. Ideo nobis dicitur Corpus Christi, ut cum hoc
recordati fuerimus, non simus ingrati gratiae ejus: quemadmodum si quis moriens
relinquat ei quem diligit aliquod pignus, quod ille post mortem ejus,
quandocunque viderit, nunquid potest lacrymas continere, si eum perfect
dilexerit?
, upon those words, The same night that our Lord was betrayed, he took Bread.
He left, says he, to us his last Memorial. -- God our Savior gave us an
Example, that as often as we do this, we may call to mind that Christ has died
for us all. Therefore we call it Christ's Body, that when we remember this, we
may not be unthankful for his Grace. As if one that was a dying should leave
some Pledge to one whom he loved, which he, after his death, when ever he
looked upon, could not contain his Tears, if he perfectly loved him.

Bid In Proverb. lib. 1. c. 3. Sicut in medio Paradisi, lignum vitae positum
testatur Moses, ita per Sapientiam Dei, viz. Christi, vivificatur Ecclesia,
cujus and nunc Sacramentis carnis and sanguinis pignus vitae accipit, and in
futuro praesenti beatificabitur aspectu.
has also given us the same Account. As, says he, Moses witnesses that the Tree
of Life was placed in the midst of Paradise, so by the Wisdom of God, to wit,
of Christ, the Church has Life given it, in whose Sacraments of his Flesh and
Blood she now receives the Pledge of Life, and hereafter shall be made happy in
a present Sight of him. Where you see he distinguishes this Pledge from his
present Aspect hereafter.

Gaudentius In Exodus tract. 2. Vere illud est haereditarium munus Testamenti
ejus novi, quodquod nobis ea nocte qua tradebatur crucifigendus, tanquam pignus
suae praesentiae dereliquit Hoc illud est viaticum nostri itineris, quo in hac
via vitae alimur ac nutrimur, donec ad ipsum pergamus de hoc seculo recedentes.
calls the Eucharist that hereditary Gift of his New Testament, which on the
night that he was delivered to be crucified, he left with us as a Pledge of his
Presence. This is the Prevision of our Journey, by which we are fed and
nourished in this way of Life, till removing from this World, we go to him.

Still we see it is a Pledge of Absence.

3 Position. Whatsoever Presence of Christ the Fathers speak of in the
Eucharist, they acknowledge the same in Baptism, and in as full Expressions. So
that if we will follow the Fathers, we may as well assert a Substantial
Presence of Christ's Body in Baptism, as in the Eucharist. But this on all
hands is denied.
Gaudentius Tract. 2. in Exodus in fine. -- Quem Sacramentis suis inesse
credimus.
in the Place last cited, speaking of our Lord Jesus, says, We believe him to
be in his Sacraments. He had spoke of both Sacraments before, and his words may
well be understood of both. I am sure other Fathers give their full consent to
it.

S. Basil De Baptism. lib. 1. cap. 2. (...).
speaking of the Excellency of Christ's Baptism, and the supereminent Glory of
it, says, That Christ the Son of God has determined it, That one greater than
the Temple, and greater than Solomon is here.

So Gr. Nazianzen Orat. 40. (...).
. Behold, one greater than the Temple is here, to them that perfectly consider.

S. Ambrose Apol. David. c. 12. Christ, in tuis te invenio Sacramentis.
, speaking of Baptism, says, O Christ, I find thee in thy Sacraments.

And again De his qui initiant. c. 2. Creed illic esse Divinitatis praesentiam.
. Believe that there is the Presence of the Divinity.

So afterward Ibid. cap. 5. Creed adesse Dominum Jesum invocatum precibus
Sacerdotum.
. Believe that the Lord Jesus is present, being invoked by the Prayers of the
Priests.

S. Austin In Joan. tract. 50. Habes Christum in praesenti per fidem, in
praesenti per signum Christi, in praesenti per baptismatis Sacramentum, in
praesenti per altaris cibum and potum.
, upon those words, The poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not
always; discourses thus concerning having Christ now. Now thou have Christ by
Faith, now thou have him by the Sign of Christ, now by the Sacrament of
Baptism, now by the Meat and Drink of the Altar.

Here you see he makes no difference of having Christ at present these several
ways he mentions.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 51. in Matthew. Lat. Graec. Savil. Hom. 50. page 322. (...),
etc.
. As when thou art baptized, it is not he ( viz. the Priest) that baptizes
thee, but it is God that holds thy Head by his invisible Power, and neither
Angel, nor Archangel, nor any other, dare approach and touch thee, etc.

The same Father Id. Epist. ad Colos. Hom. 6. (...).
thus speaks of one to be baptized, Thou shall presently embrace our Lord
himself, be mingled with his Body, be incorporated into that Body which is
seated above, whither the Devil cannot approach.

So the Author of the Commentaries upon S. Mark Inter Opera Chrysostom. Hom. 14.
Vos qui accepturi estis Baptismum, primum tenete pedes Salvatoris, lavate
lachrymis, crine tergite, etc.
speaks to those that are to be baptized, as if Christ were present. You that
are to receive Baptism, first lay fast hold on the Feet of your Savior, wash
them with your Tears, wipe them with your Hair, etc.

Marcus the Hermit De Baptism. (...).
speaking of a baptized Person, says, Upon his Baptism he has Christ lying hid
in him.

S. Chrysostom again In Gal. 3. v. 27. (...).
. If Christ be the Son of God, and thou have put him on ( viz. in Baptism)
having the Son in thy self, and being made like to him, thou art brought into
one Kindred and Nature.

Again elsewhere In Ephesians. 5. v. 30. (...).
, speaking of Christ's partaking of our Flesh and Blood, he says, He
communicated with us, not we with him: How then are we of his Flesh and of his
Bones? He means this; That as he was begotten by the Holy Ghost without the
concurrence of Man, so are we regenerate in Baptism. -- (...).
-- As therefore the Son of God was of our Nature, so are we also of his
Substance; and as he had us in himself, so also we have him in our selves. And
all this is by Baptism.

Cyril of Alexandr. Tom. 6. in Collectan. (...).
says of the Soul, That it is conjoined perfectly to Christ by holy Baptism.
And though every one knows that Union supposes Presence and Nearness, yet this is
never made an Argument that Christ is present corporally in Baptism. No more
can such like Phrases, used by him concerning the Eucharist, be urged as a
Proof of it.

S. Hilary Lib. 8. de Trinit. Nos vere Verbum cibo Dominico sumimus, quomodo
non naturaliter manner in nobis existimandus est? etc. -- Nos sub Mysterio vere
carnem corporis sui sumimus, and per hoc unum erimus, quia Pater in illo est
and ille in nobis. -- Ut cum ille in Patre per naturam Divinitatis esset, nos
contra in eo per corporalem Nativitatem, and ille rursum in nobis per
Sacramentorum inesse mysterium crederetur.
speaks many things of our real Union with Christ in the Sacrament of the
Eucharist. We truly receive the Word in the Lord's Food; how is he not then to
be thought naturally to dwell in us? -- We under the Mystery do truly take the
Flesh of his Body, and thereby shall be one, because the Father is in him, and
be in us. -- So that since he was in the Father by the Nature of the Divinity,
we on the contrary in him by Corporal Nativity, and he might be believed again
to be in us by the Mystery of the Sacraments.

But then it is observable, that he does not say these great things only of the
Eucharist, that by partaking of it we have a natural Union with Christ; but he
says we have the same by Faith, by Regeneration, and by Baptism Ibid. Quomodo
non naturalem in his intelligis unitatem, qui per naturam unius fidei unum
sunt? -- Cessat in his assensus unitas, qui unum sunt in ejusdem regeneratione
naturae. -- Quid hic animorum concordia faciet cum per id unum sint, quod uno
Christo per naturam unius Baptismi induantur?
. How do thou not understand a natural Unity in those, who are one by the
nature of one Faith? -- Again, The Unity of Consent has no place in those, who
are one in the Regeneration of the same Nature. -- Again, What should Agreement
of Wills do here, when they are one by this, that they are clothed with one
Christ, by the Nature of one Baptism?

I Will add but one Testimony more, out of Fulgentius De Bapt. Aethiop. cap. ult.
Nec cuiquam aliquatenus ambigendum est, tunc unumquemque fidelium corporis
sanguinisque Dominici participem fieri quando in Baptismate membrum Christi
efficitur.
; but it is very home. Neither need any one at all doubt, that then every
Believer is made Partaker of our Lord's Body and Blood, when he is made a
Member of Christ in Baptism.

And yet even this does not infer a Substantial Presence of Christ in Baptism.

To make this Position still more full and cogent, let me add, That the Fathers
so speak of the Waters of Baptism, as if they were turned into Blood, and we
dyed in that Blood, and baptized in Blood; and yet all these neither prove the
Presence of Christ's natural Body, nor Transubstantiation there.

To name a few Testimonies.

S. Jerome In Esa. 1. Baptizemini in sanguine meo per lavacrum regenerationis.
upon those words, Wash ye, make ye clean, says, Be ye baptized in my Blood by
the Laver of Regeneration.

Again Baptizatus est in sanguine agni quem legebat. In Esa. 43.
he says of the Eunuch, He was baptized in the Blood of the Lamb whom he read
of in the Prophet.

So S. Austin In Joan. tract. 11. Unde rubet Baptismus, nisi sanguine Christi
consecratus?
. Whence comes Baptism to be red, but because it is consecrated with Christ's
Blood?

Prosper De Promiss part. 2. Baptismo sanguine Christi tinguntur.
. They are dyed in the Blood of Christ in Baptism.

S. Chrysostom Catech. ad illuminand. (...).
speaking to those that were to receive Baptism. You shall be clothed with the
Purple Garment dyed in the Lord's Blood.

Julius Firmicus De Error. Prof. Relig. c. 28. Quaere fontes ingenuos, quaere
puros liquores, ut illic te post multas maculas cum Spiritu S. Christi sanguis
incandidet.
. Seek for the Noble Fountains, enquire for the pure Waters, that there, after
thy many Stains, the Blood of Christ with the Holy Spirit may make thee White.

Caesarius Hom. 5. Paschal. Ingreditur anima vitales undas, velut rubras
sanguine Christi consecratas.
, or the Author of the Paschal Homily. The Soul enters the Waters of Life, that
are red as it were, being consecrated by the Blood of Christ.

Isidore of Sevil In Exodus c. 19. Quid Mare rubrum, nisi Baptismum Christi
sanguine consecratum?
. What is the Red Sea, but Baptism consecrated by the Blood of Christ?

And again De vocat. Gent. c. 23. Verus Israel ingreditur Mare rubrum,
baptismum scilicet Christi cruore signatum.
. The true Israel enters the Red Sea, to wit, Baptism, signed with the Blood of
Christ.

And Primasius In 1 Cor. 10. Mare rubrum significat Baptismum Christi sanguine
decoratum.
. The Red Sea signifies Baptism, graced with the Blood of Christ.

4. Position. The Fathers so consider the Presence of Christ's Body in the
Eucharist, as can no way agree to the Presence of his natural and glorified
Body there.
The Fathers (as I have before proved, see Chap. 7. Observe. 4. Reason 2.) look
upon the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist as the Representative Body of Christ;
and thus Christ's Body is indeed present by that which is its Proxy or Pledge:
But this Presence in a proper sense is Absence, and does suppose it.

I shall therefore here only insist upon one Consideration of Christ's Body
there, which can only agree to his Representative Body, but not to the Natural
and Glorified Body of Christ. Viz.

The Presence of Christ's Body in the Eucharist, which the Fathers speak of, is
of his Body as crucified, and slain, and dead. Now this cannot agree to his
Natural Body, which, by our Adversaries Confession is impassible and
invulnerable now it is glorified, and cannot admit any separation of Parts,
which Crucifixion does suppose, nor die any more. It is plain by the words of
Institution, that the Body of Christ there spoken of, is his broken Body, such
as Crucifixon caused, and his Blood is considered as shed and poured out of his
Veins, and separated from his Body, which our Adversaries that speak of his
Presence in the Sacrament do not believe.

But the Fathers did believe this, and say so; for which at the present, in
stead of all, I need cite only S. Chrysostom Hom. 21. in Act. (...).
, whose Phrase for the Eucharist is, While this Death is perfected, this
tremendous Sacrifice, these ineffable Mysteries.

Again Homil. de Prodit. Judae. (...).
. Christ lies before us slain.

In another place In Epist. ad Ephesians. Hom. 3. (...).
. While the Sacrifice is brought forth, and Christ the Lord's Sheep is slain.

And elsewhere Ad. Popul. Antioch. hom. 15. -- (...).
. What do thou, O Man? Thou swearest upon the Holy Table, and there thou
killest thy Brother, where Christ lies slain.

Again Lib. 3. de Sacerdotio. (...), etc.
he expresses it thus rhetorically: When thou see the Lord slain and lying,
and the Priest standing by the Sacrifice and praying, and all the People
purple-dyed in that precious Blood, etc.

Again in another place In Coemeter. appel. (...), etc.
, speaking of the Priest standing before the Holy Table, etc. he adds, When
thou see the Sheep (viz. Christ). slain and divided, etc.

So also elsewhere De Poenit. in Encoen. (...), etc. (...);
. O wonderful! The Mystical Table being prepared, the Lamb of God slain for
thee, etc. his Blood emptied into the Cup out of his immaculate Side, for thy
Purification, do thou not fear?

This slaying and dividing the Body of Christ, this emptying the Blood out of
his Veins, he speaks of, cannot be understood of any thing, but of his
Representative Body.

Neither can another Saying of his have any other sense Hom. 51. in Matthew.
(...) -- (...).
; where telling us how Christ has given us leave to be filled with his holy
Flesh, he adds, He has proposed himself before us slain. So that if we eat his
Flesh, it must be his dead Body; for so he is set before us to be eaten: But
that is impossible.

But all this is easily understood in our way, or rather as he himself has
explained it, when he says Hom. 83. in Matthew. (...).
, The Mystery is the Passion and Cross of Christ.

With which agrees that of S. Austin In Psalm. 21. Coenam suam dedit, passionem
suam dedit.
. He gave his Supper, he gave his Passion.

Or, as he says in another place Super Evang. lib. 2. qu. 38. -- Tamen
passiones Domini in Sacramentis corporis and sanguinis ejus suavitate lambunt
devotissima.
, comparing the Gentiles to those Dogs that licked Lazarus's Sores; Yet, says
he, they lick the Passions of our Lord in the Sacraments of his Body and Blood
with a devout Sweetness.

The Reader will meet with further Testimonies to this purpose afterward,
under the Head of Eating Christ's Body and drinking his Blood, which, according
to the Fathers, is to be done mystically and spiritually (considered as slain),
and therefore his Presence must be such too: For his Body is present just as it
is eaten.

The Sum of all is this, That according to the Fathers, Christ is considered in
the Sacrament as dead and slain, and therefore can be only present there
typically and by representation: For so Card. Perron himself confesses De locis
Augustine. cap. 3. Sacramentum non est realiter corpus Christi in actuali
occisi, mortui and inanimati statu constitutum, nec ea ratione illud continet,
sed eatenus tantum repraesentat, etc.
, The Sacrament is not really the Body of Christ, put in the actual state of
one slain, dead, and without Life; nor does it contain it so, but in that
respect does only represent it.

5 Position. That according to the Fathers, the Presence of Christ's Body to us
now, is a Presence to our Faith and Minds, a Presence of Union, of Efficacy and
Grace.
This is S. Austin's constant Doctrine. I have cited a place out of him before,
where reckoning up the several Presences of Christ Sermon. 120. de diversis.
, the Presence of his Divinity, so he is with his Father; his Corporal
Presence, so, he says, -- Secundum praesentiam corporalem jam supra coelos ad
dextram patris est.
he is now above the Heavens, at the Right Hand of the Father; and he knows but
one more, -- Secundum vero praesentiam fidei in omnibus Christianis est.
, which is the Presence of Faith, by which he is in all Christians.

Thus also elsewhere Sermon. 12. de diversis. In coelo quidem Christus est, sed
etiam in cord credentium.
. Christ is in Heaven, but he is also in the Hearts of Believers.

And again In Evang. Joan. tract. 50. -- Audeant and teneant. Respondet, Quem
tenebo? absentem? Quomodo in coelum manum mittam, ut ibi sedentem teneam? Fidem
mitte, and tenuisti: parents tui tenuerunt carnem, tu tene cord, quoniam
Christus absens etiam praesens est, nisi praesens esset a nobis teneri non
posset, etc. -- Corpus enim suum intulit coelo, majestatem non abstulit mundo.
, exhorting the Jews to hear and take hold on Christ, he brings one in asking,
Whom shall I lay hold of? one that is absent? etc. He answers, Send forth thy
Faith, and thou have hold of him. Thy Fathers laid hold of him in his Flesh, do
thou hold him in thy Heart, because Christ who is absent, is also present; for
if he were not present, he could not be held by us. But still all is to be done
by Faith, for the Reason he gives; He brought his Body into Heaven, but his
Majesty ( i. e. his Divinity) was not withdrawn from the World.

And afterward Ibid. prope finem. Secundum praesentiam majestatis semper
habemus Christum: secundum praesentiam carnis recte dictum est discipulis, Me
autem non semper habebitis. Habuit illum Ecclesia secundum praesentiam carnis
paucis diebus: modo fide tenet, oculis non videt.
. According to the Presence of his Majesty, we always have Christ; according to
the Presence of his Flesh, it was rightly said to his Disciples, Me ye have not
always. The Church had him a few days according to his Fleshly Presence; now it
holds him by Faith, and sees him not.

So again In Ev. Joan. tract. 106. Non recte intelliguntur -- nisi hi quos in
se credentes servare jam coeperat praesentia corporali, and quos relicturus
fuerat absentia corporali, ut eos cum patre servaret praesentia spiritali.
, speaking of those whom he kept when he was with them, he says, These Words
can be rightly understood of none but those who believing on him, were begun to
be kept by him by his Corporal Presence, and whom he was about to leave by his
Bodily Absence, that he might keep them, together with his Father, by his
Spiritual Presence.

Lastly, S. Austin says Expos. in Epist. Joan. tract. 1. Dominus consolans nos
qui ipsum jam in coelo sedentem manu contrectare non possumus, sed fide
contingere, ait illi, Quia vidisti and credidisti, beati qui non viderunt and
credunt.
, Our Lord comforting us, who now that he sits in Heaven cannot handle him, but
only touch him by Faith, says to Thomas, Because thou have seen, thou have
believed; blessed are they that have not seen and believe.

S. Cyril of Alexandria agrees perfectly with this Doctrine In Joan. 13.33.
(...), etc.
, and knows no other Presence of Christ now, but what is Spiritual and Divine,
since he ascended to the Father, and left the World. For they that judge
aright, and are of a confirmed Faith, must be persuaded, that though Christ he
absent from us in the Flesh, having undertaken a long Journey to God and the
Father, that yet he compasses all things by his Divine Power, and is present to
them that love him, etc.

And again Ibid. in v. 36. (...).
. It seemed to them intolerable, to be separated from Christ, though he was
always present with them by the Power and Efficacy of the Spirit.

Elsewhere In Joan. 14.27. (...).
he lays it down as a Rule, That Christ's Spirit dwelling in the Saints,
supplies the Presence and Power of Christ in his absence.

And many more Places I might name out of him.

Their Sense is well expressed in that short Saying of the Author under S.
Cyprian's De Vnct. Chrysmat. Inest veritas signo, and Spiritus Sacramento.
Name, which I Will again repeat. Truth is in the Sign, and the Spirit in the
Sacrament.

S. Ambrose De Spir. Sanct. l. 1. c. 10. prope finem.
knows of no other Presence of Christ now, but what makes the Father to be
present with him too, and that is the Presence of the Spirit and of Grace. His
Words are very remarkable. The Spirit then so comes, Sic ergo venit Spiritus,
quemadmodum venit Pater: dixit enim Filius, Ego and Pater veniemus and
mansionem apud eum faciemus. Nunquid corporaliter Pater venit? Sic ergo
Spiritus venit, in quo cum venit, and Patris and Filii plena praesentia est. --
Paulo post, Probavimus igitur unam praesentiam esse, unam gratiam esse, Patris,
Filii, and Spiritus Sancti, quae tam coelestis and divina est, ut pro ea
gratias agat Patri Filius, etc.
as the Father comes: For the Son said, I and my Father will come, and make our
abode with him. What? does the Father come corporally? (And the same may be
asked too of the Son, by what follows.) The Spirit so comes, as that in him
when he comes is the full Presence of the Father and the Son. -- A little
after, We have therefore proved, that there is one Presence, and that there is
one Grace (which explains what the Presence is) of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, which is so Celestial and Divine, that the Son gives thanks to the
Father for it, etc.

Bid Hom. aest. de temp. feria 6. Pasch.
observing how many times Christ appeared to his Disciples after his
Resurrection, says, Hac ergo frequentia corporalis suae manifestationis
ostendere vosuit Dominus, ut diximus, in omni loco, se bonorum desideriis
divinitus esse praesentem. Apparuit namque ad monumentum lugentibus, aderit and
nobis absentiae ejus recordatione salubriter contristatis. Apparuit in
fractione panis his, qui se peregrinum esse putantes ad hospitium vocaverunt,
aderit and nobis cum peregrinis and pauperibus quaecunque possumus bona
libenter impendimus. Aderit and nobis in fractione panis, cum Sacramenta
corporis ejus, videlicet panis vivi, casta and simplici conscientia sumimus.
He designed to show by these frequent Appearances, that he would be
spiritually or divinely present in all Places at the Desire of the Faithful. He
appeared to the Women that wept at the Sepulcher; he will be likewise present
with us, when we grieve at the remembrance of his absence. He appeared, whilst
they broke Bread, to those who, taking him for a Stranger, gave him
entertainment; he will be likewise with us whilst we liberally receive the Poor
and Strangers: He will be likewise with us in the Fraction of Bread, when we
receive the Sacraments of his Body, which is the Living Bread, with a pure and
chaste Heart.

All this speaks only the Presence of his Divinity, and no other.

For, as Alcuinus In Joan. lib. 6. cap. 35. Et idem ipse Christus and homo and
Deus. Ergo ibat per id quod homo erat, and manebat per id quod Deus erat. Ibat
per id quod in uno loco erat, and manebat per id quod ubique Deus erat.
says, The same Christ who is Man, is likewise God; he left them as to his
Manhood, but remained with them as to his Godhead. He went away, with reference
to that, by which he is but in one place, (N. B.) yet tarried with them by his
Divinity, which is every where.

All Liturgies, when the Eucharist is celebrated, call aloud, (...), Sursum
corda, Lift up your Hearts. The meaning of which we are told by S. Austin De
bono Persev. l. 2. c. 13. Quod ergo in Sacramentis fidelium dicitur, ut sursum
corda habeamus ad Dominum, munus est Domini -- ut ascendat and quae sursum sunt
sapiat, ubi Christus est in dextra Dei sedens, non quae super terram, etc.
. What therefore is said in the Sacraments of the Faithful, that we should lift
up our Hearts to the Lord, it is a Gift of the Lord. And he explains it, That
by the Divine Aid the Soul is helped to ascend, and set its Affections upon
things above, where Christ is sitting at God's right Hand, and not upon things
on the Earth.

S. Jerome's Words Ad Hedybiam qu. 2. Ascendamus cum Domino coenaculum magnum
stratum and mundatum, and accipiamus ab eo sursum calicem N. Testamenti, ibique
cum eo Pascha celebrantes inebriemur ab eo vino sobrietatis.
are very emphatical. Let us, with our Lord, ascend the great upper Room
prepared and made clean, and receive from him above the Cup of the New
Testament, and there celebrating the Passover with him, be inebriated by him
with the Wine of Sobriety.

All you see is above, and our Presence too with him there.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 24. in 1 Cor. 10.
speaking how we ought to approach to the tremendous Sacrifice with Concord and
ardent Charity, says, From thence we become Eagles, and so fly to Heaven it
self: For, where the Carcass is, thither will the Eagles come. (...). -- (...).
He calls his Body the Carcass, because of his Death; and he calls them Eagles,
showing, that he who comes to this Body ought to be sublime, and have nothing
common with Earth, nor be drawn downward and creep, but continually fly upward,
and look to the Sun of Righteousness, and to have the Eye of his Mind
quick-sighted: For this is a Table for Eagles, not for Jackdaws.

Gr. Nazianzen Orat. 28. contr. Maxim.
speaking of his Adversaries, says, Will they drive me from the Altars? I know
another Altar, (...)
whose Types the things now seen are, upon which no Ax has been lift up, no
Iron Tool or other Instrument has been heard; but is wholly a Work of the Mind,
(...). --
and an Ascent by Contemplation. Before this will I present my self, on this
will I offer acceptable things, Sacrifice, (...)
Oblation, and Holocausts, so much more excellent than the things now offered,
as Truth excels a Shadow.

If Christ's Body were corporally present, it is not conceivable, what better
Oblation than that we could present, no more than of what other Oblation this
should be only a Type and Shadow.

Oecumenius In Heb. 10. v. 22. (...).
upon those words, Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of
Faith, says thus: Seeing there remains nothing visible, neither the Temple,
that is Heaven, nor the High Priest, that is Christ, nor the Sacrifice, that is
his Body; it remains that we have need of Faith.

I showed before, that the Fathers never make Christ's Body invisible, but only
from its distance and absence: And so it must be understood here, that he and
his Body, the Priest and the Sacrifice are invisible, being both in Heaven, at
that distance which makes Heaven it self and its Inhabitants invisible to us;
and therefore he recommends Faith, which can only make them present to us.

Author imperfecti Operis in Matthaeum Hom. 11. Si ergo vasa sanctificata, ad
privatos usus transfer sic periculosum est, in quibus non est verum corpus
Christi, sed mysterium corporis ejus continetur; quanto magis vasa corporis
nostri, quae sibi Deus ad habitaculum praeparavit, non debemus locum dare
Diabolo agendi in eis quod vult.
, (among the Works of Chrysostom in Latin) has this Saying: If therefore it be
so dangerous a thing, to turn the Sanctified Vessels to private Uses, in which
is not the true Body of Christ, but only the Mystery of his Body is contained
therein; how much more as to the Vessels of our Body, which God has prepared
for himself to dwell in, we ought not to give place to the Devil to act in them
what he pleases.

One may trust an Adversary as to his Opinion of what makes against him; These
Words were looked upon as so considerable an Objection, that an Attempt to
corrupt them was practiced long ago. The Learned Archbishop Usher (in the
Preface of his Answer to the Jesuit's Challenge) has observed, That those words
[ in quibus non est verum corpus Christi, sed mysterium corporis ejus
continetur] were left out wholly, in an Edition at Antwerp, 1537. and at Paris,
1543. and in another at Paris, apud Audoenum Parvum, 1557. Dr. James (in his
Corruption of True Fathers, p. 53.) says, Those words are found in all the
ancient Copies at Oxford, as Archbishop Usher says they were extant in the
ancienter Editions, as in 1487. And I my self have seen one Paris Edition, even
in the Year 1536. (apud Claud. Chevallonium) where those words are extant. So
that I conclude, That the Antwerp Edition first mentioned ( apud Joan.
Steelfium, 1537.) was the first that made the Alteration. But then I further
observe, That in the large Paris Edition in Latin of S. Chrysostom, 1588.
which I have by me, those words are inferted indeed in the Text, but enclosed
within two Brakets, with this Note in the Margin, [Haec in quibusdam
exemplaribus desunt,] which is very fine work, when they themselves had omitted
them in the forenamed Prints.

They have played the same Prank with the same Author, in another of his
Homilies, ( viz. Hom. 19.) whose Words were not favorable to the Real Presence
of Christ's Body in the Eucharist. The words are these.

Perhaps thou will object, Sed forte dices, quomodo dicere illum possum, non
esse Christianum, quem video Christum confitentem, altar habentem, Sacrificium
panis and vini offerentem, baptizantem, etc.
How can I say that he is not a Christian, whom I see confessing Christ, having
an Altar, offering the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine, baptizing, etc.

In the Paris Edition apud Audoenum Parvum, An. 1557. as Dr. James Notes, those
words, [Sacrificium panis and vini] are changed into these, [Sacrificium
corporis and sanguinis Christi.] The Paris Edition of 1588. (before mentioned)
though it had more Conscience than to insert this Change into the Text, yet so
far complied with the Cheat, as to put in the Margin [alias, Sacrificium
corporis and sanguinis Christi.]

If this Trade had gone on successfully, they might have had in time a Consent
of Fathers on their side; but it can never be without it.

I will conclude this Particular with one Observation more, of what the Reader
may find at large discoursed of, in a late Learned Dissertation of Monsieur
Allix Dissert. de Sanguine D. N. Jesu Christi ad Epist. 146. S. Augustini.
Utrum nunc corpus Domini ossa and sanguinem habeat.
, upon occasion of an Epistle of S. Austin to Consentius, who enquired of him,
Whether now the Body of Christ has Bones and Blood? The very reading of that
146th Epistle of S. Austin, wherein he plainly, in his Answer to that Question,
betrays his doubting of it, as well as in other of his Works; his
distinguishing betwixt Christ's having a true Body after his Resurrection, and
his having Flesh and Blood; the Testimonies there of other of the Ancients,
especially of Origin and his Followers, that seem plainly to make both the
glorified Body of Christ, and also of Believers, to be of another Composition
than that of proper Flesh and Blood; these, I say, are a Demonstration, that
the Ancient Fathers did not believe any Presence of true Flesh and Blood to be
now in the Eucharist.

Neither do I think the Answer given to this Dissertation by Monsieur Boileau,
Dean of Sens Disquisit. Theolog. de Sangu. Corporis Christi post resurrectionem.
, to be a satisfactory one in this Particular. For though I should grant (which
yet I see not sufficiently cleared by him) that generally the Fathers, and S.
Austin also, did believe, that Christ had a Body, after the Resurrection, of
the same Substance, though differing in Qualities, from what he had before; yet
there are Three things that he has by no means said any thing material to, in
his Answer.

1. That he has given no Account of S. Austin's studious declining to determine
any thing in particular about the Blood of Christ, when he had never so fair an
occasion to do it; but waves this always, even where he seems, as he does in
his Retractations, to determine for his having palpable Flesh and Bones.

2. Why S. Austin should ever at all doubt or hesitate about this Matter of
Christ's Blood after his Resurrection, is unconceivable, if he, with the rest
of the Fathers, had such a constant Belief of its Presence in the Eucharist, as
the Romanists affirm.

3. That though the Fathers use the Argument of the Eucharist to prove the Truth
of Christ's Body, yet none ever urged Origin or his Followers with an Argument
from thence, to confute their Opinions, differing from the pretended common
Sentiments about the Body and Blood of Christ, by what lay so plainly before
them, of his Body and Blood being in the Eucharist, if they had believed it.
But I refer the Reader to Monsieur Allix his Dissertation, before-named,
wherein he may find abundant Satisfaction in these Matters; and also will see
how sadly the Romanists are put to it, to answer the Difficulties about the
Blood of Christ, which they pretend to show in so many Churches, and is
produced in such Quantities, that may well cause a new Doubt, Whether if his
Resurrection-Body have any Blood in it, we must not suppose it to be of a new
Creation, since what was in his Body when he died, cannot suffice to furnish
more Blood, if so much, as their Vials and Glasses are filled withal.

CHAP. X. The Tenth Difference. The Fathers assert positively, that the
substance of the Elements remain after Consecration; that Bread and Wine are
taken, eaten and drunk in the Sacrament: which all that believe
Transubstantiation must deny.
WE have seen before that the Fathers say plainly, that it was Bread which
Christ called his Body, when he blessed it. Now we shall see, that the Fathers
are as positive, that after Consecration, and the change made by it, yet still
the Bread and Wine remains.

I begin with that famous Testimony of S. Chrysostom against the
Apollinarians; produced first by P. Martyr; by some of our Adversaries charged
upon him as his Forgery, because it was so full against them; by others shifted
off to another John of Constantinople, and denied to be S. Chrysostom's; but
vindicated for his, See Append. to the Defense of the Exposition of the
Doctrine of the Church of England, p. 142, 143, etc.
by the Learned Bigotius, who had transcribed it out of the Florentine Library
of S. Mark's Monastery, and prepared it for the Press, in his Edition of
Palladius; then suppressed by some Doctors of the Sorbonne, and the printed
leaves taken out of the Book; but now lately recovered and published to their
shame^ A passage of which (the subject of this great contest) I shall here set
down.

Christ is both God and Man: God, Deus and homo Christus: Deus propter
impassibilitatem, Homo propter Passionem. Unus Filius, unus Dominus, idem ipse
proculdubus unitarum naturarum unam dominationem, unam potestatem possidens,
etiamsi non consubstantiales existunt, and unaquaeque in commixtam proprietatis
conservat agnitionem, propter hec quod inconfusa sunt, [duo] dico. Sicut enim
antequam sanctificetur Panis, Panem nominamus, divina autem illum Sanctificante
gratia, mediante sacerdote, liberatus est quidem appellatione panis, dignus
autem habitus est dominici corporis appellatione, etiamsi natura panis in ipso
permansit, and non duo corpora, sed unum corpus filii praedicatur. Sic and hic
Divina (...), id est, inundante corporis natura, unum filium, unam personam,
utraque haec fecerunt. Agnoscondum tamen inconfusam and indivisibilem rationem,
non in una solum natura, sed in dimbus perfectis.
for that he is impassible, Man for that he suffered. One Son, one Lord, he the
same without doubt, having one Dominion, one power of two united natures: not
that these (natures) are consubstantial, seeing each of them does retain
without confusion its own properties, and being two are inconfused in him. For
as (in the Eucharist) before the Bread is consecrated, we call it Bread, but
when the grace of God by the Priest has consecrated it, it has no longer the
name of Bread, but is counted worthy to be called the Lords Body, although the
nature of Bread remains in it, and we do not say there are two Bodies, but one
Body of the Son. So here, the divine nature being joined to the (humane) Body,
they both together make one Son, one Person; but yet they must be acknowledged
to remain without confusion, and after an indivisible manner, not in one nature
only, but in two perfect natures.

Another remarkable Testimony, is in Theodoret's Dialogues; some part of which
I hope the Reader will not think it tedious to be inserted here, since by
observing the thread of his Discourse, he will see his undoubted sense to be,
that the substance of the Bread and Wine remain in the Eucharist, and the
change is by addition not annihilation; and I will add his Greek where it is
needful.

Orthodoxus. Erannistes. I know it. Orth. Elsewhere also he calls his Flesh
Wheat. Eran. I know that also. Unless a Corn of Wheat fall into the ground and
die, etc. Orth. But in the delivery of the mysteries, he called the Bread his
Body, and that which is mixed (viz. Wine and Water in the Cup) Blood. Eran. He
did so call them. Orth. But that which is his Body by nature ((...)) is also to
be called his Body, and his Blood (viz. by nature) Blood. Eran. It is
confessed. Orth. (...)
But our Savior changed the names, and on his Body he imposed the name of the
symbol (or sign) and on the symbol he put the name of his body; And so having
called himself a Vine, he called the Symbol Blood. Eran. Very right. But I have
a mind to know the reason of this change of names. Orth. The scope is manifest
to those that are initiated in Divine things. (...)
For he would have those that participate the divine mysteries, not to attend
to the nature of those things that are seen, but upon the changing of the
names, to believe the change that is made by grace. For he that called his
Body, that is so by nature, Wheat and Bread, (...)
and again termed himself a Vine, he honored the visible Symbols with the
appellation of his Body and Blood, not altering nature, but to nature adding
grace.

Proceed we now to the next Dialogue.

Orth. Eran. Of the Lords Body and Blood. Orth. Of his Body truly or not truly
such? Era. Of that which is truly (his Body). Orth. Very right. For there must
be an original of an Image ((...)) for Painters imitate nature, and draw the
Images of visible things. Era. True. Orth. (...)
If then the divine mysteries are Antitypes of a true Body, then the Lords Body
is a true Body still, not changed into the nature of the Deity, but filled with
Divine Glory. Era. You have seasonably brought in the Discourse of the Divine
Mysteries; for thereby I will show that the Lords Body is changed into another
Nature. Answer therefore my Question. Orth. I will. Era. What call you the Gift
that is offered before the Priests Invocation? Orth. I may not openly declare
it, for perhaps some here present may not be initiated. Era. Answer then
Aenigmatically. Orth. I call it the food that is made of a certain grain. Era.
How call you the other Symbol? Orth. By a common name that signifies a kind of
drink. Era. But how do you call it after Consecration? Orth. The Body of
Christ, and the Blood of Christ. Era. And do you believe you partake the Body
and Blood of Christ? Orth. Yes, I believe it. Era. As then the Symbols of
Christ's Body and Blood are one thing before the Priests Invocation, but after
the Invocation, are changed and become another thing; so the Lords Body, after
his Assumption, is changed into a Divine Essence. Orth. (...)
You are caught in a Net of your own weaving. For after sanctification, the
mystical Symbols do not depart from their own nature; for they remain still in
their former substance, and figure and form, and may be seen and touched just
as before. But they are understood to be that which they are made, and are
believed and venerated, as being those things they are believed to be.

How shamefully Mr. Sclater has attempted to pervert these last words of
Theodoret, he has been told sufficiently by his Answerer.

The next Testimony is of Gelasius De dua^bus naturis in Christo. Certe
Sacramenta quae sumimus, corporis and sanguinis Christi, divina res est,
propter quod and per eadem divinae efficimur consortes naturae; and tamen esse
non definit substantia vel natura panis and vini; and certe Imago and
similitudo corporis and sanguinis Christi in action mysteriorum celebrantur.
Satis ergo nobis evidenter ostenditur, hoc nobis in ipso Christo Domino
sentiendum, quod in ejus imagine profitemur, celebramus and sumimus; ut sicut
in hanc, sc. in Divinam transeunt Spiritu S. perficiente substantiam,
permanente ramen in suae proprietate naturae, sic illud ipsum mysterium
principale, cujus nobis efficientiam Virtutemque veraciter repraesentant, ex
quibus constat proprie permanentibus, unum Christum, quia integrum verumque
permanere.
Bishop of Rome. The Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Christ which we take,
are surely a divine thing; for which reason we become by them partakers of the
Divine nature; and yet the substance or nature of Bread and Wine does not cease
to be; and indeed the Image and likeness of the Body and Blood of Christ are
celebrated in the action of the mysteries: therefore it appears plainly enough
to us, that we ought to think that of our Lord, which we profess and celebrate
and receive in his image; that as they ( viz. the Elements) pass into that
Divine substance, the H. Spirit effecting it, their nature still remaining in
its own property; so that principal mystery whose efficiency and virtue these
(the Elements) truly represent to us, remains one entire and true Christ; those
things of which he is compounded ( viz. the two natures) remaining in their
properties.

Ephrem Antiochenus Apud Photii Biblioth. cod. 229. (...).
treating of the two Natures (which he calls palpable and impalpable, visible
and invisible) united in Christ, adds, Thus the Body of Christ which is
received by the faithful, does not depart from its sensible substance, and yet
remains unseparated from the intellectual grace. So Baptism becoming wholly
spiritual and one, it preserves its own sensible substance, I mean Water, and
does not lose what it is made to be.

Our Adversaries, to testify the respect they have for the Fathers, when they
do not speak as they would have them, they try to make them speak so as no Body
shall understand their true sense. And as the Putney Convert did by Theodoret,
so the Jesuit Andr. Schottus (not for want of skill, but honesty) has dealt
with this of Ephrem, making it, by his translation, obscure, or rather
unintelligible nonsense. For the first words [(...)] he translates [sensibilis
essentiae non cognoscitur, it is not known of a sensible nature,] and the other
expression about Baptism [(...)] he turns it thus. [Hocque substantiae
sensibilis proprium est per aquam, inquam, servat. And this is the property of
sensible substance, it keeps, I say, by Water.] A good Man cannot take more
pains to find out Truth than this Man does that it may be lost.

The next Testimony, is of Facundus, Lib. 9. defens. 3. capit. cap. 5.
Sacramentum adoptionis suscipere dignatus est Christus, and quando circumcisus
est and quando baptizatus est: and potest Sacramentum adoptionis adoptio
nuncupari, sicut Sacramentum corporis and sanguinis ejus quod est in pane and
poculo consecrato, corpus ejus and sanguinem dicimus; non quod proprie corpus
ejus sit panis, and poculum sanguis, sed quod in se mysterium corporis
sanguinisque contineant. Hinc and ipse Dominus benedictum panem and calicem,
quem discipulis tradidit, corpus and sanguinem suum vocavit.
the African Bishop. Christ vouchsafed to receive the Sacrament of Adoption,
both when he was Circumcised and when he was Baptized: and the Sacrament of
Adoption may be called Adoption, just as we call the Sacrament of the Body and
Blood of Christ, which is in the Consecrated Bread and Cup, his Body and Blood.
Not that properly Bread is his Body, and the Cup his Blood, but because they
contain in them the mystery of his Body and Blood. Hence it is, that our Lord
himself called the Bread and Cup he blessed, and gave to his Disciples, his
Body and Blood.

Nothing can be more positive than these five Testimonies, that the Bread and
Wine remain in their substance after Consecration. And I cannot but here add
the remarkable Confession of an Adversary, concerning two of them.

For thus Card. Alan De Euchar. Sacram. l. 1. c. 35. De duobus, Gelasio and
Theodoreto, facile mihi persuadeo, eos solos esse ex omni Antiquitate, qui
inclinaverunt in communem postea multorum errorem, ut ita defenderent veram
conversionem panis, ut materiam Elementi, sicut in caeteris naturalibus
transmutationibus fieri videbant, relictam esse concederent, etc.
says, Concerning these two, Gelasius and Theodoret, I readily persuade my
self, that they are the only persons in all Antiquity (though I have already
produced three more of their mind) who inclined to that, which was afterward a
common error, so to defend the true Conversion of Bread, that they granted the
matter of the Element to remain, as they saw it did in all other natural
transmutations.

But we will try whether the rest of the Fathers did not also speak the same
thing.

Justin Martyr Dial. cum Tryph. (...).
speaking of the oblation of fine Flour for those that were cleansed from
Leprosy, says, It was a type of the Bread of the Eucharist, which our Lord J.
Christ commanded us to make in memory of his passion. What we make (as was
showed, cap. 8. observe. 7.) can be only Bread, not Christ's Body in a proper
sense.

Again Apol. 2. (...) --
telling us of the Bishops praying and giving thanks over the Elements, he
adds, that the Deacons give to every one present leave to take of the Bread and
Wine of the Eucharist.

That this was his sense appears further, by another Character he gives of it
in the same place, (...)
when he calls it Food by which our Flesh and Blood by a change are nourished.

What he says in another place Dial. cum Tryph. p. 345. Edit. Paris. 1615.
(...).
of Christians remembering their Lords Passion by their dry and wet food, can
agree only to Bread and Wine, which therefore must be supposed to remain.

S. Irenaeus L. 5. adv. haeres. c. 2. Ex quibus augetur and consistit carnis
nostrae substantia.
asserts with Justin, that the Bread and Cup of the Eucharist is that, by which
the substance of our Flesh is nourished and consists.

In another place Ibid. l. 4. c. 34. Carnem quae a corpore Domini and sanguine
alitur.

Quemadmodum qui est a terra panis, percipiens invocationem Domini, jam non
communis panis est, sed Eucharistia ex duabus rebus constans, terrena and
coelesti, etc.


he not only says, that our Flesh is nourished by the Body and Blood of our
Lord, but adds, As the Bread that is from the Earth, perceiving the Lords
Invocation, is not now common Bread, but the Eucharist, consisting of two
things, an Earthly and an Heavenly, etc. Though not common Bread, yet Bread
still, because else it would consist only of one thing, viz. Christ's Body, and
no earthly thing besides.

Origin Comm. in Matthew. 15. v. 15. p. 254. Edit. Huet. -- (...).
. If every thing that enters into the mouth gees into the Belly and is cast
into the draught, then also the food that is sanctified by the word of God and
Prayer, as to the material part of it (which can be nothing but Bread) goes
into the Belly, etc. but in respect of the Prayer that is superadded -- it
becomes profitable, etc. (...)
Nor is it the matter of the Bread, but the word that is said over it that
profits him that eats it not unworthily of the Lord.

Cyprian Epist. ad Caecilium, l. 2. Ep. 3. alias 63. Invenimus calicem mixtum
fuisse quem Dominus obtulit, and vinum fuisse quod sanguinem suum dixit.
. We have found that it was a mixed Cup which our Lord offered, and that it was
Wine which he called his Blood.

Macarius Homil. 27. (...).
In the Church is offered Bread and Wine, the Antitype of his Flesh and Blood,
and they that are partakers of the visible Bread, do spiritually eat the Flesh
of the Lord.

Epiphanius In Compend. fidei. (...).
in a place I before cited, speaking of the Eucharist, says, that the Bread is
food, but the virtue that is in it, is for begetting Life. It does not cease to
be food, though the quickening power is all from the grace and spirit of God in
it.

S Ambrose De Benedict. Patriarch. c. 9. Hunc panem dedit Apostolis, ut
dividerent populo credentium, hodieque dat nobis eum, quum ipse quotidie
sacerdos consecrat suis verbis. Hic panis factus est esca Sanctorum.
speaking of the Benediction of Assure, Her Bread is fat, etc. says, Christ gave
this Bread to the Apostles, to divide it among believing people, and now he
gives it to us, whenas the Priest daily Consecrates with his words. This Bread
is made to be the food of Saints.

S. Austin L. 3. de Trin. c. 4. Corpus Christi and sanguinem dicimus illud
tantum, quod ex frugibus terrae acceptum and prece mystica consecratum, rite
sumimus ad salutem spiritualem in memoriam pro nobis Dominicae Passionis; quod
cum per manus hominum ad illam visibilem speciem perducitur, non sanctificatur
ut sit tam magnum Sacramentum nisi operante invisibiliter Spiritu Dei.
. We only call that the Body and Blood of Christ, which being taken from the
fruits of the Earth, and Consecrated by mystical Prayer, we rightly receive to
our spiritual health in memory of our Lords Passion. Which, when it is by the
hands of men brought to that visible substance, is not sanctified to become so
great a Sacrament, unless the spirit of God invisibly operate.

Again Idem Ibid. c. 10. Panis ad hoc factus in accipiendo Sacramento
consumitur.
. Bread made for this purpose is consumed in receiving the Sacrament. But it is
neither received nor consumed till it be Consecrated, nor then but when eaten.

And again elsewhere Sermon. 9. de diverse. cap. 7. Eucharistia panis noster
quotidianus est; sed sic accipiamus illum, ut non solum ventre sed and mente
reficiamur.
The Eucharist is our daily Bread; but let us so receive it, that we may not
only have refreshment for our bellies, but for our minds.

Upon this account it is, that looking upon the Sacrament as a refreshing food
to our Bodies (as S. Austin here speaks) the Ancients believed, that by
partaking of the Eucharist, they Broke their Fasts; this appears beyond all
question in what Tertullian Lib. de Orat. c. 14. ad finem. Stationum diebus non
putant plerique sacrificiorum orationibus interveniendum, quod statio solvenda
sit accepto corpore Dominico.
says; who in resolving a doubt that troubled some minds, what they should do,
when it happened that by a private vow they undertook a strict Fast (which
obliged them not to take any refreshment till Evening) and this fell out upon a
station day (which was usually Wednesdays and Fridays) when the Fast was ended
at three a Clock by receiving the Communion. Most think, says he, that on the
station days they ought not to be present at the Prayers of the Sacrifices
(when the Eucharist was administered) because the Fast was broken upon receiving
the Lords Body. Tertullian excepts not against this reason, but grants it, and
finds out such an expedient as would be counted ridiculous in the Roman Church
(where this of the Sacraments breaking the Fast is not believed) which is, to
be present, and to take the Sacrament, and reserve it to be eaten at night.

By receiving the Lords Body, Accepto corpore Dominico and reservato, ucrumque
salvum est, and participatio Sacrificii and executio officii.
says he, and reserving it, both is salved, both the partaking of the Sacrifice
( i. e. of the Eucharist given at three a Clock) and the execution of their
duty (he means of fasting till Evening, according to their Vow, and eating the
Sacrament then, and not before.) But to proceed with our Testimonies.

Hesychius In Levit. l. 2. c. 8. Propterea carnes cum panibus comedi
praecipiens, ut nos intelligeremus illud ab eo mysterium dici, quod simul panis
and caro est, sicut Corpus Christi panis vivi qui de Coelo descendit.
. God therefore commanded Flesh to be eaten with Bread, that we might
understand, that that mystery ( viz. the Eucharist) was spoken of by him, which
is both Bread and Flesh, as the Body of Christ the living Bread that descended
from Heaven. It can be only Bread and Flesh in our way, for in that of
Transubstantiation it is only Flesh and no Bread.

S. Austin Lib. cont. Donatist. c. 6. De ipso pane and de ipsa Dominica manu,
and Judas Partem and Petrus accepit; and tamen quae Societas, quae consonantia,
quae pars Petri cum Juda?
. Of the very Bread Judas and Peter both took a part, and yet what Society,
what agreement, what part has Peter with Judas?

Again Id Tract. in Joan. 26. Patres manducaverunt spiritualem utique eandem (
escam) nam corporalem alteram, quia illi Manna, nos aliud -- and omnes eundem
potum spiritualem biberunt, aliud illi, aliud nos, sed specie visibili quidem,
tamen hoc idem significante virtute spirituali.
. The Fathers did eat the same spiritual meat with us, but the corporal was
different, they did eat Manna, we another thing (he means Bread) -- and they
all drank the same spiritual drink, they one thing, we another, another as to
the visible substance, but in spiritual virtue signifying the same thing.

And again elsewhere Id. Tract. 45. in Joan. Videte ergo, fide manente, signa
variata. Ibi Petra Christus, nobis Christus quod in Altari ponitur; and illi
pro magno Sacramento ejusdem Christi biberunt aquam profluentem de Petra, nos
quid bibamus norunt fideles. Si speciem visibilem intendas aliud est, si
intelligibilem significationem eundem potum spiritualem biberunt.
. Behold while Faith remains the same, the signs are varied. There (in the
Wilderness) the Rock was Christ, to us that which is placed on the Altar ( viz.
Bread) is Christ; And they drank the Water that flowed from the Rock for a
great Sacrament of the same Christ, what we drink the faithful know, ( viz.
Wine) if you regard the visible substance it is another thing, if the spiritual
signification they drank the same spiritual drink.

Again in another place Tract. 26. in Joan. Nam and nos hodie accepimus
visibilem cibum; sed aliud est Sacramentum, aliud est virtus Sacramenti.
. We have received to day the visible food; but the Sacrament is one thing, and
the virtue of the Sacrament is another.

That which he calls here cibus visibilis (the visible food) a little after S.
Austin calls it visibile Sacramentum (a visible Sacrament) where he
distinguishes this again from the Virtus Sacramenti (the Virtue of the
Sacrament) so that the visible food, and the visible Sacrament, with him are
the same.

I have already produced the Testimonies ( vid. chap. 8. Observe. 5.) where the
Fathers make what is distributed in the Eucharist to be without Life or sense;
which can be true of nothing else but of the Bread and Wine. So that unless we
make them distribute what they had not consecrated, the Bread and Wine must
remain after Consecration.

The same is also evidently proved from another common assertion of the
Fathers, that Christ offered the same oblation with Melchisedek.

S. Cyprian Lib. 2. Epist. 3. Quis magis sacerdos Dei summi, quam Dominus
noster Jesus Christus, qui Sacrificium Deo Patri obtulit and obtulit hoc idem
quod Mechisedec obtulerat, id est panem and vinum, suum scilicet corpus and
sanguinem?
. Who was more a Priest of the most High God, than our Lord Jesus Christ, who
offered a Sacrifice to God the Father, and offered this same that Melchisedeck
had offered, that is Bread and Wine, to wit his Body and Blood? Which indeed
the Wine and Bread was by representation, but if you understand this of proper
Flesh and Blood offered in the Eucharist, then it is not the same oblation with
that of Melchisedeck.

Isidere Peleusiota Lib. 1. Epist. 431. ad Pallad. (...).
. Melchisedeck performed his sacred Office in Bread and Wine, by which he
foresignified the type of the divine mysteries.

Eusebius Lib. 5. Them. Evang. c. 3. (...) (Melchisedeck) (...), etc.

-- (...).


. For as he (Melchisedeck) being a Priest of the Gentiles never seems to have
made use of Bodily Sacrifices, but blessed Abraham only in Bread and Wine.
After the same manner also, first our Lord and Savior himself, then all the
Priests that derive from him, performing in all Nations their spiritual
function according to the Ecclesiastical Sanctions, by Bread and Wine do
express the mysteries of his Body and saving Blood, Melchisedeck having
foreseen these things by a divine spirit, and having used before these images
of future things.

S. Jerome Epist. ad Evagrium. Melchisedec pane and vino simplici puroque
sacrificio, Christi dedicaverit Sacramentum.
. Melchisedeck by Bread and Wine, which is a simple and a pure Sacrifice, did
dedicate Christ's Sacrament.

S. Austin Epist. 95. Melchisedec prolato Sacramento coenae Dominicae novit
aeternum ejus sacerdotium figurare.
. Melchisedeck, bringing forth the Sacrament of the Lords Supper (i. e. Bread
and Wine) knew how to figure Christ's Eternal Priesthood.

Again L. 17. de civit. Dei, c. 17. -- Ex eo quod jam nusquam est Sacerdotium
and Sacrificium secundum ordinem Aaron, and ubique offertur sub sacerdote
Christo, quod protulit Melchisedec quando benedixit Abraham.
upon those words, Thou art a Priest for ever, etc. He adds, Since now there is
no where any Priesthood or Sacrifice, according to the Order of Aaron; and that
is every where offered under Christ the Priest, which Melchisedeck brought
forth when he blessed Abraham.

In many other places S. Austin says the same.

Arnobius In Psalm. 109. Christus per mysterium panis and vini factus est
sacerdos in a ternum.
. Christ by the mystery of Bread and Wine, is made a Priest for over.

S. Chrysostom Comment. in Psalm. 110. vel 109. -- (...).
. Why did he say, a Priest after the Order of Melchisedeck? Even because of the
mysteries, because he also brought out Bread and Wine to Abraham.

Isidore of Sevil In Genesin cap. 12. Non secundum Aaron pecudum Victimas, sed
oblationem panis and vini, id est, corporis and sanguinis ejus Sacramentum in
Sacrificium offeramus.
. Let us not offer the Victims of Beasts according to Aaron, but let us offer
in Sacrifice the oblation of Bread and Wine, that is the Sacrament of Christ's
Body and Blood.

Bid Hom. de 55. in Vigil. S. Jo. Bapt. Redemptor noster ideo sacerdos esse
dicitur secundum Ordinem Melchisedec, quia, ablatis victimis legalibus, idem
sacrificii genus in mysterium sui corporis and sanguinis in N. Testamento
offerendum instituit.
. Our Redeemer is therefore called a Priest, after the Order of Melchisedeck,
because taking away the legal Sacrifices, he instituted the same kind of
Sacrifice ( viz. Bread and Wine) should be offered under the N. Testament, for
the mystery of his Body and Blood.

What the Scriptures acquaint us with, that after the Blessing of the Bread,
Christ brake it and gave it to his Disciples, is also insisted on by the
Fathers as done in the Eucharist, in order to the distributing of it to the
receivers.

But Bellarmine says expressly L. 1. de Missa, c. 27. Nostra fractio non fit ad
distribuendum, sed ad certum mysterium significandum.
. That our breaking is not made for distribution, but to signify a certain
mystery. Therefore in the Roman Church, that which they give in the Sacrament
to the people is whole, and not broken off from any other thing. Wherein they
differ from the Fathers, for their Eucharist was what the Apostles call
breaking of Bread, Act. 2 46. and the Jesuit Lorinus upon that place observes,
that it was the manner of the Primitive Church, Lorinus in Act. 2. v. 46. Panem
unum conficere, atque illum consecratum in tot parts frangere, quot erant
communicantes, sicut and Christus in coena fecit.
to make one Loaf, and when they had consecrated it, to break it into so many
parts as there were Communicants, as Christ also did in his Supper. And thus as
it is 1 Cor. 10.17. There is one Bread, etc. and we being many are one Body,
for we all partake of one Bread.

This Fraction, though the Fathers express it as if it were done to the proper
Body of Christ, yet they mean it only of the Bread that represents it: and
therefore that must remain, for there is nothing else to be broken.

When therefore S. Chrysostom Hom. 24. in 1 Cor. Tom. 3. Edit. Savil. p. 397.
(...).
says, that upon the Cross a Bone of him was not broken, but what Christ did
not suffer upon the Cross, that he suffers in the oblation for thy sake, and
suffers himself to be broken, that he may fill us all. This cannot be meant of
any thing but what represents his Body torn and rent, viz. Bread.

So S. Austin Epist. 59. -- Et ad distribuendum comminuitur.
speaks of that upon the Lords Table, which is blessed and sanctified, and
broke in small pieces to be distributed. Which can be only Bread.

And this elsewhere Epist. 86. -- Sicut frangitur in Sacramento Corporis
Christi.
he expresses more plainly. Paul, says he, broke Bread that night, as it is
broken in the Sacrament of the Body of Christ.

Again August. apud Bedam in 1 Cor. 11. Manducemus Christum; vivit manducatus,
quia surrexit occisus: nec quando manducamus, parts de illo facimus, and
quidem in Sacramento id fit; and norunt fideles quemadmodum manducent carnem
Christi, unusquisque accipit partem, etc.
S. Austin thus exhorts. Let us eat Christ; he lives though eaten, for he arose
though slain. Neither when we eat him, do we make parts of him; so indeed we do
in the Sacrament, and the faithful know how they eat the Flesh of Christ
(there.) Every one takes a part, etc.

This is a very remarkable Testimony, because of the distinction he makes
between Christ's proper Body, and that in the Eucharist, affirming quite
different things of them, as this of taking and eating a part, which is only
true of the Bread. For as for the true Body of Christ, we are informed by
another,

Chrysologus Sermon. 159. Non potest Christus edi and dividi. Integer a
credentibus sumitur, integer in ore cordis recipitur.
. Christ cannot be eaten and divided. He is taken whole of Believers, he is
received whole in the mouth of the heart.

I will conclude this Chapter with the sayings of three great persons among the
Fathers, who positively assert what I have been proving, that the Bread and
Wine remain in the Eucharist.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 83. in Matthew. (...).
. Who says expressly, When our Lord delivered the mysteries, he delivered Wine.

S. Austin De Civ Dei, lib. 17. cap. 5. Manducare panem, est in N. Testamento
sacrificium Christianorum.
. To eat Bread, is the Sacrifice of Christians in the N. Testament.

Fulgentius De fide ad Petrum, cap. 19. Christo nunc, id est, tempore N.
Testamenti, cum Patre and Spiritu Sancto, cum quibus una est illi Divinitas,
Sacrificium panis and vini in fide and charitate Sancta Ecclesia Catholica per
universum orbem terrae offerre non cessat.
. Now; that is, in the time of the N. Testament, the Holy Catholic Church,
throughout the whole Earth, does not cease to offer in Faith and Charity, the
Sacrifice of Bread and Wine to Christ, with the Father and H. Spirit, who have
one Divinity together with him.

CHAP. XI. The Eleventh Difference. The Fathers make the Bread and Wine to be
the Sacrament, Sign, Figure, Type, Antitype, Image, etc. of Christ's Body and
Blood. They of the Church of Rome, make either the Accidents subsisting without
a Subject, or the Body of Christ latent under those Accidents, to be the
Sacrament, Sign, Figure, etc. and not the substance of Bread and Wine, which
they say is abolished. Therefore they have no Sacrament such as the Fathers
assert.
I Might give in here a very large Collection out of the Fathers, calling the
Bread and Wine by all those names above mentioned; but to avoid tediousness, I
shall only select some few of them (enough to prove the Truth of what I have
asserted) under the several heads.

S. Ambrose De iis qui initiant. c. 9. Vera utique caro Christi, quae crucifixa
est, quae sepulta est, vere ergo carnis illius est Sacramentum.
. It is the true Flesh of Christ that was buried; therefore it ( viz. the
Eucharist) is truly the Sacrament of his flesh.

S. Austin Sermon. ad recen. Batis. Quomodo est panis corpus ejus, and calix, vel
quod habet calix, sanguis ejus? Ista, fratres, ideo dicuntur Sacramenta, quia
in iis aliud videtur, aliud intelligitur.
. How is the Bread his Body, and the Cup, or what the Cup contains, his Blood?
These, Brethren, are therefore called Sacraments, because in them we see one
thing, and understand another.

Again In Psalm. 68. conc. 1. Cum veniret Dominus ad coenam, qua commendavit
Sacramentum corporis and sanguinis sui.
. When the Lord came to the Supper, wherein he commended the Sacrament of his
Body and Blood.

Facundus Defens 3. capit. l. 9. Christi fideles Sacramentum corporis and
sanguinis ejus accipientes, corpus and sanguinem Christi recte dicuntur
accipere. -- non quod proprie corpus ejus sit panis and poculum sanguis, sed
quod in se mysterium corporis sanguinisque contineant.
. Christ's faithful ones, receiving the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, are
rightly said to receive his Body and Blood. And he had said before, Not that
the Bread is properly his Body, and the Cup his Blood, but because they contain
in them the mystery of his Body and Blood.

Isidore De Offic. Eccles. l. 1. c. 18. Haec duo sunt visibilia, sanctificata
autem per Spiritum Sanctum in Sacramentum Divini Corporis transeunt.
speaking of the Bread and Wine, says, These two are visible, but being
sancrified by the Holy Spirit they pass into a Sacrament of his Divine Body.

They call them also Symbols.

Origin Comm. in Matthew. 15. (...).
. Having discoursed (as we hear^ before) of the Eucharist, concludes thus. Thu
much may suffice concerning the Typical and symbo lical Body. And distinguishes
it from the word that was made Flesh, which he calls true food.

Eusebius Them. Evang. l. 1. cap. 10. (...), etc.
. Having received a command to celebrate the memory of this Sacrifice upon the
Table, by the Symbols of his Body and saving Blood, according to the Ordinances
of the N. Testament.

Theodoret Comm. in 1 Cor. 13. (...).
, not only in the large Testimony produced out of him in the last Chapter,
calls the Bread and Wine the Symbols of Christ's Body and Blood, but says thus
elsewhere. In the most H. Baptism we see a type of the resurrection, then we
shall see the resurrection it self. Now we see the Symbols of the Lords Body,
there we shall see the Lord himself.

They call them Signs.

S. Austin Contr. Adimant. c. 12. Non dubitavit Dominus dicere hoc est corpus
meum, cum daret signum corporis sui.
. Our Lord did not doubt to say, This is my Body, when he gave the sign of his
Body.

S. Ambrose De iis qui init. c. 9. Ante benedictionem verborum Coelestium alia
species nominatur, post Consecrationem Corpus Christi significatur.
of the Bread. Before the Benediction of the Heavenly words, another species is
named, after the Consecration the Body of Christ is signified.

S. Cyprian Nec potest videri sanguis ejus quo redempti and vivificati sumus,
esse in calice, quum vinum desit calici, quo Christi sanguis ostenditur. Epist.
ad Caecilium.
. Neither can the Blood of Christ, whereby we are redeemed and quickened, be
seen to be in the Cup, when Wine is wanting in the Cup, whereby the Blood of
Christ is shown. Speaking against those that used only Water.

Tertullian -- L. 1. adv. Marcion. Nec panem reprobavit, quo ipsum Corpus suum
reptaesentat.
. Neither did he reject Bread, whereby he represents his own Body.

S. Jerome In Matthew. 26. -- Ut quomodo in praefiguratione ejus Melchisedec
summi Dei sacerdos panem and vinum offerens fecerat, ipse quoque veritatem sui
corporis and sanguinis repraesentarer^
. Christ, says he, took Bread that comforts man's heart, and proceeded to the
true Sacrament of the Passover, That like as Melchisedeck the Priest of the
High God had done, when he offered Bread and Wine, so he also might represent
the truth of his Body and Blood.

It Is a very trifling objection that our Adversaries make both to this and the
former Testimony in Tertullian, that the word repraesentare (to represent)
signifies very often to exhibit a thing, and make it present; for though it
should be granted, it would not help their cause, since they both say, that it
is Bread that represents his Body, which therefore must remain, since that
which is not cannot act any thing: but then I add, that though in some Cases to
represent is to exhibit, yet never in the Case of Sacraments and Signs, for
their Essence consists in signification, therefore their representation as
Signs, must be to denote and show rather something absent which they represent,
than to make it present.

They call them also Types.

Cyril of Jerus. Catech. Mystag. 4. -- (...).
He bids us receive the Bread and Wine with all certainty, as the Body and
Blood of Christ: for in the Type of the Bread his Body is given to thee, and in
the type of Wine his Blood.

Greg. Nazianzen In Pasch. Orat. 43. Ed. Basil. Gr. (...).
We. shall receive the Passover now in a Type still, though more clear than that
of the old Law (for the legal Passover, I am beld to say it, was an obscure
Type of a Type) but within a while we shall receive it more perfect and more
pure.

S. Jerome In Jerem. 31.
upon those words of Jerem. 31. They shall flow unto the goodness of the Lord,
for Wheat, and Wine and Oil, adds, -- De quo conficitur panis Domini, and
sanguinis ejus impletur typus, and benedictio sanctificationis ostenditur.
Of which is made the Lords Bread, and the Type of his Blood is filled, and the
Blessing of Sanctification is shown.

Theodoret Dialog. 3. -- (...).
calls the Eucharist, The venerable and saving Type of Christ's Body.

Another name is Antitypes, signifying the same with the former.

Author Constitutionum Lib. 5. cap. 13. -- (...).
under the name of Clemens Roman. Christ delivered to us the mysteries which
are antitypes of his precious Body and Blood.

Again Lib. 7. c. 26.
O our Father, we give thee thanks for the precious Blood of Jesus Christ shed
for us, -- (...).
and for his precious Body of which we celebrate these Antitypes.

Eustathius of Antioch In Proverb. 9. citat. in Cenc. Nic. 2. Act. 6. (...).
, expounding those words, Eat my Bread, and Drink the Wine that I have mingled,
says, He speaks these things, by Bread and Wine preaching the Antitypes of
Christ's Bodily Members.

Macarius Homil. 27. (...).
. In the Church is offered Bread and Wine, the Antitype of Christ's Flesh and
Blood.

Greg. Nazianzen Orat. 11.
telling the story how his Sister Gorgonia was Cured of a desperate Malady,
(...), etc.
by applying the Sacrament mixed with tears to her Body, he expresses it thus.
Whatsoever of the Antitypes of the precious Body and Blood of Christ her hand
had treasured up, etc.

Cyril of Jerus. Catech. Mystag. 5. (...).
. When they taste, they are not required to taste Bread and Wine (i. e. not these
alone) but the Antitype of Christ's Body and Blood.

Theodoret (as we heard before Dialog. 2. (...).
) calls the Divine Mysteries, the Antitypes of the True Body of Christ.

And in another place Recapit. in fine Dialog. 3. -- (...).
he says, If the Lords Flesh be changed into the Nature of the Divinity,
wherefore do they receive the Antitypes of his Body, for the Type is
superfluous (you see Type and Antitype signify the same) when the Truth is
taken away.

Theodotus of Antioch Citante Bulingero adv. Casaub. p. 166.
says, As the King himself and his Image are not two Kings, neither are these
two Bodies, viz. The Body of Christ personally existing in the Heavens, and the
Bread, the Antitype of it, which is delivered in the Church by the Priests to
the Faithful.

They call it a Figure.

Tertullian Lib. 3. adv. Maricion. Tanem corpus suum appellans, ut hinc etiam
intelligas corporis sui figuram pani dedisse.
. Calling Bread his Body, that thou may thence understand, that he gave to
the Bread the Figure of his Body.

Again Lib. 4. adv. Marcion. c. 40. Acceptum panem and distributum discipulis,
corpus suum illum fecit, hoc est corpus meum, dicendo, id est, figura corporis
mei.
. The Bread which he took and distributed to his Disciples, he made it his
Body, saying, This is my Body, that is, the Figure of my Body.

Ephrem Syrus Tract. de not. dei curiose non scrutanda. Diligenter intuere,
quomodo in manibus panem accipiens, benedixit and fregit in figuram immaculati
corporis sui, calicemque in figuram pretiosi sanguinis sui benedixit deditque
discipulis suis.
. Diligently consider, how Christ taking Bread in his hands, blessed and brake
it, for a figure of his immaculate Body, and also blessed and gave the Cup to
his Disciples, for a figure of his precious Blood.

S. Austin In Psalm. 3. Adhibuit (Judam) ad convivium, in quo corporis and
sanguinis sui figuram discipulis commendavit and tradidit.
. He admitted Judas to the Banquet, in which he commended and delivered to his
Disciples the figure of his Body and Blood.

Bid In Psalm. 3. Nec a Sacratissima coena, in qua figuram Sacrosancti corporis
sanguinisque suis discipulis tradidit, ipsum (sc. Judam) exclusit.
also says the same, Neither did Christ exclude Judas from the most holy
Supper, in which he delivered to his Disciples the figure of his most holy Body
and Blood.

And elsewhere In Luc. 22. Pro agni carne vel sanguine suae carnis sanguinisque
Sacramentum in panis and vini figura substituens, ipsum se esle monstraret, cui
juravit Dominus, Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum Ordinem Melchisedec.
, Christ instead of the Flesh or Blood of a Lamb, substituting the Sacrament in
the Figure of Bread and Wine, showed that it was he, to whom the Lord swear,
Thou art a Priest for ever after the O^^^ of Melchisedeck.

The words of the Ambrosian Office are very remarkable, as they are set down by
the Author of the Book of Sacraments under his name, where he asks this
Question.

Lib. 4. de Sacram. c. 5. in initio. Vis scire quia verbis coelestibus
consecratur? Accipe quae sint verba. Dicit sacerdos, Fac nobis, inquit, hanc
oblationem ascriptam, rationabilem, acceptabilem, quod est Figura corporis and
sanguinis Domini nostri Jesu Christi, etc.
Would thou know that the Eucharist is Consecrated by Heavenly words? Hear
then what the words are. The Priest says, Make this oblation to us allowable,
rational, acceptable, which is the Figure of the Body and Blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ, etc.

This Prayer thus expressed in this Office, signifies more than all that can be
cited against us out of these Books; and indeed they were too plain to be
continued, when Transubstantiation was believed in the Roman Church, and
therefore in the present Canon of the Mass they are changed, and instead of
Figura Corporis, they now read, Fiat nobis Corpus, etc.

Lastly, The Fathers call the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, the Image of
Christ's Body.

Eusebius Lib. 8. Demon. Evang.
. Christ, says he, delivered to his Disciples the Symbols of his Divine
Economy, -- (...).
requiring them to make an Image of his Body.

Gelasius Tract. de duabus Naturis. Certe Imago and Similitudo corporis and
sanguinis Christi in action mysteriorum celebrantur. Satis ergo nobis
evidenter ostenditur, hoc nobis in ipso Christo Domino sentiendum, quod in ejus
imagine profitemur, celebramus and sumimus, etc.
. Surely the Image and similitude of the Body and Blood of Christ are
celebrated in the action of the mysteries. It is evidently therefore shown to
us, that we must think of our Lord Christ the same, which we profess, celebrate
and take in his Image, etc.

Procopius of Gaza Comm. in 49 Genes.
expounding these words spoken (...) Juda, His Eyes shall be red with Wine, and
his Teeth (...) Milk (Genesis 49.12.) he applies it to the Eucharis^ (...)
gladness which is obtained by the (...) first tasted, and had his Disciples
take and (...) Milk may signify the purity (...) food, (...)
for he gave the ^^^ge of his (...) his Disciples, no longer requiring the
bl^^dy (...) of the Law, and by the white teeth be denoted the purity of the
Bready by which y^^ are nourished.

Author Dialog. adv. Marcionitas inter opera Originis Dialog. 3. -- (...).
. If Christ, as the Marcionists say, was without Flesh and without Blood, of
what Flesh, or of what Body or Blood did he give the Images, and commanded his
Disciples to make a remembrance of him by?

Synodus Constantinop. an. 754. In Council. Nicen. 2. Act. 6. -- (...).

-- (...).

-- (...).


. The Fathers there call the Eucharist, the true Image of Christ, and say
afterward -- Christ commanded us to offer an Image, a chosen matter, to wit,
the substance of Bread, not having an humane Figure, lest Idolatry should be
introduced.

And again. It pleased him, that the Bread of the Eucharist, being the true
Image of his natural Flesh should be made a Divine Body, being sanctified by
the coming of the Holy Ghest, the Priest which makes the oblation intervening
to make it holy, which before was common.

He that would have more Testimonies of this kind, may consult Monsieur
Blondel, in his Esclaircissements sur l' Eucharistie, cap. 4. prop. 8.

The Fathers also make two or three Remarks, which add further strength to this
Argument.

First Remark. They not only make Bread and Wine to be the Image, Type, Figure,
etc. of Christ's Body Crucified; but they also assert, that an Image, Figure,
etc. cannot be the thing it self, of which it is an Image and Figure.

Tertullian Cont. Marcion. l. 2, c. 9. Imago veritati non usquequaque
adaequabitur, aliud enim est secundum veritatem esse, aliud ipsam veritatem
esse.
. The Image cannot be every ways adequate to the Truth; for it is one thing to
be according to Truth, another to be the Truth it self.

Athanasius Contr. Hypocr. Milet. (...).
That which is like to another is not that thing it self to which it is like.

Hilary De Synodis. Neque enim sibi ipsi quisquam imago est.
. Neither is any one an Image of himself.

S. Ambrose De fide l. 1. cap. 4. Nemo potest sibi ipsi imago fuisse.
. None can ever have been an Image of Himself.

Gr. Nyssen De anima and resurrect. (...).
. An Image would be no longer such if it were altogether the same with that of
which it is an Image.

S. Austin De Trinit. l. 7. c. 1. Quid absurdius quam Imaginem ad se dici?
. What can be more absurd, than to be called an Image with respect to ones self.

Gaudentius In Exodus tract. 2. Figura non est veritas, sed imitatio veritatis.
. A Figure is not the Truth, but an imitation of the Truth.

Theodoret In Dan. l. 2. c. 2. (...).
. An Image has the Figures and lines, not the things themselves.

Cyril of Alexand. In Amos. cap. 6. (...).
. A Type is not the Truth, but rather imports the similitude of the Truth.

Bertram De corp. and sang. Domini. Pignus and Imago alterius rei sunt, id est,
non ad se, sed ad aliud aspiciuu^
. A pledge and an Image are of another thing; that is, they do not look to
themselves, but to something else.

This Epiphanius the Deacon In Council. Nic. 2. Act. 6.
in the second Council of Nice confesses, and therefore is fain to deny, that
the Eucharist is the Image or Antitype of Christ's Body; (...)
For, says he, If (the Eucharist) be an Image of his Body, it cannot be the
Divine Body it self.

Damascen also De Orth. fide l. 4. c. 14.
who was one of the first Innovators in the matter of the Eucharist, denies,
that the Bread and Wine are a Type or Figure of Christ's Body and Blood, but the
very Body and Blood it self; and that when the Ancients call them (...)
Antitypes, they mean it is so before Consecration of the Elements not after,
which I have abundantly showed, by foregoing Testimonies in this Chapter, to be
false, and it is confessed by some of the Roman Authors themselves.

In a word, the Fathers make a sign to be inferior, and to fall short of the
thing signified; thus

S. Chrysostem Hom. 8. in Epist. ad Roman. (...).
says, It is inferior to it, and so much the more, as a sign is below the
thing of which it is a sign.

So also S. Jerome (as we heard before) puts the Body and Blood of Christ in
the Eucharist, in the same rank as to veneration with holy Chalices, Veils, and
other things that relate to the Passion of our Lord

2 Remark. The Fathers assert, that an Image and Type must visibly demonstrate
that of which it is an Image.

Origin Hom. 1. in Genes. Qui viderit imaginem alicujus, videt eum cujus imago
est.
. He that sees the Image of a person, sees him of whom it is an Image.

Marcellus Anchyr. apud Eusebium Lib. 1. cont. Marcel. c. 4. (...).
. Images are demonstrative of those of whom they are Images, so that by them he
that is absent seems to appear.

Greg. Nyssen In Cant. Hom. 15. (...).
. The Original is plainly seen in the likeness of it.

Hilary De Synodis. Eum cujus Imago est, necesse est ut imago demonstret.
. It is necessary that an Image should demonstrate him of whom it is an Image.

Which plainly confutes those men's fancies in the Church of Rome Bellarm. de
Euchar. l. 2. cap. 15.
, who make Christ invisibly present in the Eucharist, to be the sign of himself
visibly suffering upon the Cross.

For as Greg. Nyssen Lib. 1. cont. Eunom. (...);
says. How can a man form an Idea of a visible thing from an Invisible?

And Tertullian laughs at it as ridiculous, when he says, Lib. de carne Christi
c. 11. Nemo ostendere volens hominem, cassidem ant personam introducit.
No one that intends to show a man, brings in a Helmet, or a Vizard. Which, we
know, hide him from our sight.

Irenaeus L. 2. adv. haeres. c. 40. Typus secundum materiam and substantiam
aliquoties a veritate diversus est. Secundum autem habitum and lineamentum
debet servare similitudinem, and similiter ostendere per praesentia, ea quae
non sunt praesentia.
says, A Type is often different from the Truth, according to the matter and
substance of the Type, but according to the habit and lineaments, it ought to
keep likeness, and likewise by things present, show those things that are not
present.

3. Remark. The Fathers plainly make the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, to be
Signs and Symbols of Christ as absent.

S. Ambrose L. 1. de Offic. cap. 48. Hic umbra, hic Imago, illic veritas. Umbra
in Lege, imago in Evangelio, veritas in Coelestibus.
. Here is the shadow, here the Image, there (viz. in Heaven) is the Truth. The
shadow is in the Law, the Image in the Gospel, the Truth in Heaven.

Again In Psalm 38. Ascend ergo, homo, in coelum, and videbis illa quorum
umbra hic erat vel Imago.
. Ascend, O Man, into Heaven, and thou shall see those things, of which there
was here only a shadow or Image.

Maximus In cap. 1. Hierarch. Eccles. (...).
the Interpreter of the Spurious Dionysius, speaking of the Bread and Wine
which he calls Holy Gifts, says, They are Symbols of things above that are more
true.

So again In Cap. 3. (...).
elsewhere he says, The things of the Old Law were a shadow, those of the New
Testament were an Image, but the state of the World to come is the Truth.

Theodoret In 1 Cor. 11.26. (...).
. After his coming there will be no more need of Symbols (or Signs) when the
Body it self appears.

I refer the Reader to the Testimonies produced before ( Chap. 10. Position 2.)
out of S. Austin, Sedulius, Primasius, Bid, etc.

I will conclude this Chapter with a passage or two out of the Prayers after
the Sacrament in the Old Liturgy, used in Bertram's time V. Bertram de corp.
and sang. Christi prope finem. p. 112. Edit. ult. Lat. Engl.
.

We who have now received the Pledge of Eternal Life, most humbly beseech thee
to grant, Ut quod in imagine contingimus Sacramenti, manifesta participatione
sumamus.
That we may be manifestly made partakers of that which we here receive in the
Image of the Sacrament.

And thus afterward Ibid. p. 114. Perficiant in nobis quaesumus, Domine, tua
Sacramenta quod continent; ut quae nunc specie gerimus, rerum veritate capiamus.
in another Prayer. Let thy Sacraments work in us, 'O Lord, we beseech thee,
those things which they contain, that we may really be partakers of those
things which now we celebrate in a Figure.

Bertram Comments upon these Prayers, in such passages as these. Whence it
appears, says he, that this Body and Blood of Christ are the Pledge and Image
of something to come, which is now only represented, but shall hereafter be
plainly exhibited. -- therefore it is one thing which is now celebrated, and
another which shall hereafter be manifested. And afterward (p. 115.) The
Prayer says, that these things are celebrated in a Figure, not in Truth, that
is, by way of similitude (or representation) not the manifestation of the thing
it self. Now the Figure and the Truth are very different things: Therefore the
Body and Blood of Christ, which is celebrated in the Church, differs from the
Body and Blood of Christ which is glorified since the Resurrection, etc.

We see how vast a difference there is between the mystery of Christ's Body and
Blood which the faithful now receive in the Church, P. 117.
and that Body which was born of the Virgin Mary, which suffered, rose again,
ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. For this
Body which we celebrate in our way (to happiness) must be spiritually received;
for Faith believes somewhat that it sees not; and it spiritually feeds the
Soul, makes glad the heart, and confers Eternal Life and Incorruption, if we
attend not to that which feeds the Body, which is chewed with our teeth, and
ground in pieces, but to that which is spiritually received by Faith. But now
that Body in which Christ suffered and rose again, was his own proper Body
which he assumed of the Virgin, which might be seen and felt after his
Refurrection, etc.

It is very observable, and a great confirmation of what has been said in this
Chapter, That the Ancient Christians of S. Thomas, inhabiting the Mountains of
Malabar in the East Indies, agree with the Ancient Church in denying our
Saviors Corporal Presence in the Sacrament of the Eucharist; as appears from
their Public Offices, and other Books, mentioned in a Synod which was
celebrated amongst them by Dom Aleixo de Menezes Archbishop of Goa, in the Year
1599.

In the fourteenth Decree of the third Action of the said Synod, in which most
of their Church Offices and other Books are Condemned, for containing Doctrines
contrary to the Roman Faith, there is particular notice taken of their
contradicting the Roman Faith in the point of Transubstantiation.

1. The Book of Timothy the Patriarch is condemned, for asserting through three
Chapters, that the true Body of Christ our Lord is not in the Sacrament of the
Altar, but only the Figure of his Body.

2. The Book of Homilies is condemned, which teaches, that the H. Eucharist is
only the Image of Christ, as the Image of a Man is distinguished from a real
Man; and that the Body of Christ is not there, but in Heaven.

3. The Book of the Exposition of the Gospels is condemned, which teaches,
that the Eucharist is only the Image of the Body of Christ, and that his Body
is in Heaven at the right Hand of the Father, and not upon Earth.

4. Their Breviary, which they call Iludre and Gaza, is condemned; which
teaches, that the most H. Sacrament of the Eucharist is not the true Body of
Christ.

Lastly, The Office of the Burial of Priests is condemned, where it is said,
that the most H. Sacrament of the Altar, is no more but the virtue of Christ,
and not his true Body and Blood.

This Synod was Printed in the University of Conimbra, with the Licenses of the
Inquisition and Ordinary in the Year 1606. and is in the Possession of a
Learned Person, who gave me this account out of it.

CHAP. XII. The Twelfth Difference. The Fathers assert, That Christ's Body is
not eaten corporally and carnally, but only spiritually. But the Church of Rome
teaches a Corporal Eating, a Descent of Christ's Natural Body into ours, and
understands the Eating of Christ's Body literally and carnally.
IF the Church of Rome declares its own Faith, when it imposes the Profession
of it upon another, and makes one abjure the contrary under pain of Anathema;
then I am sure it was once with a witness for the eating of Christ's Body in
the most literal and proper Sense; when An. Dom. 1059. Pope Nicholas II. and
the General Council of Lateran, prescribed a Profession of it to Berengarius,
made him swear it, and anathematize the contrary, as it is set down by Lanfrank
De Eucharist. Sacram. adv. Berengar.
; which because the Nubes Testium (though it has set down two other. Forms) durst
not give us, I will therefore here transcribe out of him.

I Berengarius, Ego Berengarius indignus Diaconus Ecclesiae S. Mauritii
Andegavensis, cognoscens veram Catholicam and Apostolicam Fidem, anathematizo
omnem Haeresin, praecipue eam de qua hactenus infamatus sum; quae astruere
conatur panem and vinum quae in altari ponuntur, post consecrationem solummodo
Sacramentum, and non verum corpus and sanguinem Dom. nostri Jesu Christi esse;
nec posse sensualiter, nisi in solo Sacramento, manibus Sacerdotum tractari,
vel frangi, aut fidelium dentibus atteri. Consentio autem S. Romanae Ecclesiae
and Apostolicae sedi, and ore and cord profiteor de Sacramentis Dominicae
mensae, eam fidem tenere, quam Dominus and Venerabilis Papa Nicholaus and haee
S. Synodus authoritate Evangelica and Apostolica tenendam tradidit, mihique
sirmavit: scilicet, Panem and vinum quae in altari ponuntur post
consecrationem, non solum Sacramentum, sed etiam verum corpus D. N. J. Christi
esse, and sensualiter non solum Sacramento, sed in veritate manibus Sacerdotum
tractari, frangi and fidelium dentibus atteri, jurans per S. and homousion
Trinitatem, and per haec sacrosancta Christi Evangelia. Eos vero qui contra
hanc fidem venerint cum dogmatibus and sectatoribus suis aeterno anathemate
dignos esse pronuncio, etc.
unworthy Deacon, etc. knowing the true Catholic and Apostolic Faith, do
anathematize all Heresy, especially that for which I have hitherto been
defamed; which endeavors to maintain, that the Bread and Wine placed on the
Altar, after Consecration, are only a Sacrament (or Sign), and not the true
Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ; and cannot, save only in the Sign, be
handled or broken by the Priest's Hands, or be ground by the Teeth of the
Faithful. But I agree with the Holy Roman Church, and the Apostolic Seat, and
do with my Mouth, and from my Heart profess, That I hold the same Faith
concerning the Sacraments of the Lords Table, which our Lord and Venerable Pope
Nicholas and this Holy Synod, by Evangelical and Apostolical Authority, has
delivered to me to hold, and confirmed to me, viz. That the Bread and Wine
which are placed on the Altar, after Consecration, are not only a Sacrament,
but also the true Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, and is sensibly, not only in
the Sign and Sacrament, but in truth, handled and broken by the Priests Hands,
and ground by the Teeth of the Faithful: Swearing this by the Holy and
Co-essential Trinity, and by the most Holy Gospels of Christ. And as for those
that oppose this Faith, I judge them, with their Opinions and Followers, worthy
of an eternal Anathema, etc.

This we may look upon as the Belief of that Church then, and this to be the
manner of eating the Body of Christ: since, as Bellarmine well obferves De
Sacr-Euchar. l. 3. c. 21. Nec coguntur ulli abjurare and anathematizare
sententias dubias, sed eas tantum quae damnantur ab Ecclesia, tanquam haereses
exploratae.
, None are compelled to abjure and anathematize dubious Opinions, but only such
as are condemned by the Church as known Heresies.

But however Infallible this Pope and that General Council were, this way of
eating Christ's Body, by tearing it with the Teeth, was quickly opposed, (as a
late Learned Preface to the Determination of Joh. Parisiensis shows at large.)

Peter Lombard could not digest it Sentent. lib. 4. did. 12, Fractio and
parts quae ibi videntur fieri, in Sacramento fiunt, i. e. in visibili specie.
Ideoque illa Berengarii verba ita distinguenda sunt, ut sensualiter, non modo
in Sacramento, sed in veritate dicatur corpus Christi tractari manibus
Sacerdotum: Frangi vero and atteri dentibus, vere quidem sed in Sacramento
tantum.
. For though the Pope and Council defined, That both the handling, and also the
breaking and tearing with the Teeth of Christ's Body, were not only in the Sign
and Sacrament, but in Truth performed; he makes a distinction, and in express
words (cited in the Margin) says, That Christ's Body is handled indeed, not
only in Sacrament, but in Truth; but that it is broken and torn with the Teeth
truly indeed, but yet only in Sacrament. That is, in the visible Species, as he
before explains that Phrase. Directly contrary to Berengarius's Recantation.

The words also of Job. Semeca, the Author of the Gloss upon the Canon Law
Gloss. apud Gratian. de Consecr. Did. 2. c Ego Berengarius. Nisi sane
intelligas verba Berengarii in majorem incides Haeresin quam ipse habuit; and
ideo omnia referas ad species ipsas; nam de Christi corpore parts non facimus.
, are very bold against it. Unless you understand the words of Berengarius in a
sound sense, (and there can be no other, the words are so plain, but what must
contradict it) you will fall into a greater Heresy than he was guilty of; and
therefore you must refer all to the Species, (that is directly contrary to the
Pope and Council) for we do not make Parts of Christ's Body.

In fine, all the great Writers, especially the Jesuits, have forsaken this
Definition, as not to be maintained, and this Eating in the most proper sense
is wholly discarded; and we are told De Sacr. Euchar. l. 1. c. 11. Ad rationem
manducationis, non est necessaria attritio, sed satis est sumptio, and
transmissio ab ore ad stomachum per instrumenta humana and naturalia, i. e.
linguam and palatum.
by Bellarmine, That grinding with the Teeth is not necessarily required to
Eating; but it suffices that it be taken in, and transmitted from the Mouth
into the Stomach by humane and natural Instruments, viz. the Tongue and Palate.

This way, in plainer terms, is swallowing the Body of Christ without chewing.
And indeed without this Descent of it into the Body, there could no Account be
given of that Prayer in the Roman Missal Corpus tuum, Domine, quod sumpsi, and
sanguis quem potavi, adhaereat visceribus meis.
: Lord, let thy Body which I have taken, and thy Blood which I have drunk,
cleave unto my Entrals.

They have also determined how long this Sacred Body makes its stay there.
Aquinas (whom they all now follow) says In 3. part. quaest. 76 art. 6. ad 3.
Corpus Christi remanet in hoc Sacramento, quousque species sacramentales
manent. Quibus cessantibus desinit esse corpus Christi sub eis.
, The Body of Christ remains in this Sacrament, so long as the Sacramental
Species remain: When they cease to be, the Body of Christ ceases to be under
them.

Thus also Domin. Soto In 4. did. 12. qu. 1. art. 3. Est indubie tenendum quod
corpus (sc. Christi) descendit in stomachum. -- Cum digestio fiat in stomacho
illic desinunt esse species, atque adeo corpus, quare non descendit in ventrem.
. We ought undoubtedly to hold, That Christ's Body descends into the Stomach.
-- Since Digestion is made in the Stomach, there the Species cease to be, and
so also Christ's Body, and therefore will not descend into the Draught.

But now comes a scurvy Case, that will force out the whole Truth. Suppose, by
reason of any Disease, the Species should descend further than the Stomach; as
in a Flux, when there is no Digestion of the Species, nor time to do it in the
Stomach, but they are presently carried downward whole, or else brought up
immediately, as in case of sudden Vomiting. This also is resolved by the same
Principles. So the last-named Author Soto ibid. Sed si ob aliquem morbum
species descenderent, consequenter and ipsum corpus descenderet and
emitteretur. Pudor enim non debet esse in causa negandi veritatem.
. If by reason of any Disease the Species should descend, (into the Draught, he
means) the Body also it self would descend and be sent forth. For Shame ought
not to be a Reason for denying the Truth.

To which S. Antoninus Part. 3. tit. 13. cap. 6. sect. 3. Igitur corpus Christi
and sanguis tamdiu manet in ventre and stomacho vel vomitu and quocunque alibi,
quamdiu species manent, sicut substantia conversa mansisset. Et si species
incorruptae evomuntur, vel egrediuntur, est ibi vere corpus Christi.
agrees, (citing Paludanus in the case.) Therefore the Body and Blood of Christ
remains so long in the Belly and Stomach, or Vomit, or any where else, as the
Species remain, just as the converted Substance (viz. Bread and Wine) would
have remained. And if the Species are vomited up whole, or go forth (downwards)
there is truly the Body of Christ.

And he tells us of S. Hugo Cluniac. how he commended one Goderanus, who (by a
strange fervor) swallowed down the Particles of an Host, which a Leper had
vomited up with vile Spittle, saying, That S. Laurence his Gridiron was more
tolerable.

If these Consequences seem horrid and detestable to the Reader, the Doctrine,
from which they necessarily flow, ought to be looked upon much more so.

But now, to return to the Fathers, and their Sense of Eating the Body of
Christ.

It is evident to any that will impartially consult their Writings, that they
were perfect Strangers to all these Cases that are thus currently resolved in
the Roman Church.

That Christ's Natural Body should enter into ours, is too gross and carnal a
Thought, to be attributed to them; and fits only the Imaginations of a Carnal
Church, and of those Capernaites, who in the Sixth of S. John ask, How can this
Man give us his Flesh to eat?

Christ tells them, That the Words he spoke to them were Spirit and Life. And
so the Fathers always understood the eating of Christ's Body and drinking his
Blood, not in a literal and proper, but in a figurative and spiritual Sense; as
I shall now prove from their Writings. Wherein it may not be amiss to take
notice, first, What their Sense is about understanding things carnally and
spiritually.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 46. in Joan. (...).
asking this Question, What is it to think (or understand) carnally? He
answers, Simply to look upon the things proposed, and to think of no more. --
But we ought to view all Mysteries with our inward Eyes: for this is
spiritually to view them.

S. Austin De Doctr. Christ. l. 3. c. 5. Cum figurate dictum sic accipitur,
tanquam proprie dictum sit, carnaliter sapitur.
gives the same account. We have a carnal Taste, when we take that which is
figuratively spoken, as if it were properly spoken.

And elsewhere Sermon. 44. de diversis. Omnis figurata and allegorica lectio
vellocutio, aliud videtur sonare carnaliter, aliud insinuare spiritualiter.
. Every figurative and allegorical Reading or Speech, seems to sound one thing
carnally, and to insinuate another thing spiritually.

S. Austin De Doctr. Christ l. 3. c. 16. Si praecepriva est locutio, aut
flagitium aut facinus yetans, aut beneficentiam jubens, non est figurata. Si
autem flagitium aut facinus videtur jubere, aut utilitatem aut beneficentiam
vetare, figurata est. Nisi manducaveritis carnem filii hominis, etc. facinus
vel flagitium videtur jubere: Figura ergo est, praecipiens passioni Domini esse
communicandum, and suaviter atque utiliter in memoria condendum, quod caro ejus
pronobis crucifixa and vulnerata est.
further gives a Rule when to understand a thing literally, and when to
understand it figuratively and spiritually. If the Speech be by way of command,
either forbidding a Crime or heinous Wickedness, or bidding a beneficial or
good thing to be done, it is not figurative: But if it seems to command a Crime
or heinous Wickedness, or forbid an useful and beneficial thing, it is
figurative. And then he gives the Example of his Rule, in those words of
Christ, Except ye eat the Flesh and drink the Blood of the Son of Man, ye have
no Life in you. Now this, says he, seems to command a Crime or horrid thing;
therefore it is a Figure, commanding us to communicate in the Passion of our
Lord, and sweetly and profitably to treasure up in our Memory, that his Flesh
was crucified and wounded for us.

Origin said the very same before him Hom. 7. in Levitic. non solum in Veteri
Testamento occidens Litera deprehenditur, est and in N. Testamento Litera quae
occidit cum qui non spiritualiter quae dicuntur adverterit. Si enim secundum
literam sequaris hoc ipsum quod dictum est, Nisi manducaveritis carnem meam,
and biberitis sanguinem meum, occidit haec litera.
, and gives the same Instance. Not only in the Old Testament is found the
killing Letter; there is also in the New Testament a Letter that kills him who
does not spiritually consider what is said. For if thou follow this according
to the Letter which was said, Unless ye eat my Flesh and drink my Blood, this
Letter kills.

And in another place In Joan. Tom. 10. (...), etc. -- (...).
. We are not to eat the Flesh of the Lamb, as the Slaves of the Letter do, etc.
To which he opposes those who receive the Spirituals of the Word.

Such as those whom S. Austin mentions In Joan. tract. 26. Quia visibilem cibum
spiritaliter intellexerunt, spiritaliter esurierunt, spiritaliter gustaverunt,
ut spiritaliter satiarentur.
, who pleased God and died not ( i. e. eternally). Because they understood the
visible Food (Manna) spiritually, they hungered spiritually, they tasted
spiritually, that they might spiritually be satisfied.

Or, as he expresses it a little after Ibid. Qui manducat intus non foris, qui
manducat in cord, non qui premit dente.
, He that eats inwardly, not outwardly; that eats in his Heart, not he that
presses it with his Teeth. And therefore elsewhere Sermon. 33. de Verb. Dom.
Nolite parare fauces, sed cor.
exhorts them, Do not prepare your Jaws, but your Heart.

This is what Clemens Alexandr. Strom. l. 1. (...).
requires, when he says, That Christ, when he broke the Bread, set it before
them, that we may eat it rationally, i. e. spiritually.

So S. Austin again De Verb. Apost. Sermon. 2. Tunc vita unicuique erit corpus
and sanguis Christi, si quod in sacramento visibiliter sumitur, in ipsa
veritate spiritualiter manducetur, spiritualiter bibatur.
. The Body and Blood of Christ will then be Life to every one, if what is
visibly taken in the Sacrament, be in truth spiritually eaten and spiritually
drunk. Where he makes this to be eating in Truth, and the other but Sacramental.

So Macarius Homil. 27.
having called the Bread and Wine the Antitype of Christ's Flesh and Blood, he
adds, -- (...).
They which are Partakers of the visible Bread, do spiritually eat the Flesh of
the Lord. He should rather have said orally, according to the Doctrine of our
Adversaries.

S. Athanasius Tract. in illud Evang. Quicunque dixerit verbum contra filium
hominis.
expounding those words, What if ye see the Son of Man ascending where be was
before? It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh profits nothing, etc.
adds, -- (...).
He affirmed both of himself, the Flesh and Spirit, and made a difference
betwixt the Spirit and the Flesh, that not only believing that of him which was
visible, but what was invisible, they might learn, that those things which he
spoke were not carnal, but spiritual. -- (...);
For to how many could his Body have sufficed for Meat, that it should be made
the Food of the whole World? But therefore he mentions the Son of Man's
Ascension into Heaven, that he might draw them from this corporal Conceit, --
(...).
and hereafter might learn, that the Flesh he spoke of was celestial Meat from
above, and spiritual Nourishment to be given by him, etc.

It will suffice all the World, if we follow Tertullian's De Resurr. c. 37.
Quia and sermo caro erat factus, proinde in causam vitae appetendus, and
devorandus auditu, and ruminandus intellectu, and fide digerendus.
Advice. Since the Word was made Flesh, he is to be longed for that we may
live, to be devoured by Hearing; to be chewed by Understanding, and digested by
Faith.

It is an excellent Comment on this, which Euebius gives us Lib. 3. Eccl.
Theol. c. 12. (...). -- (...).
upon those words of John 6. The Flesh profits nothing, etc. Do not imagine
that I speak of that Flesh I am encompassed withal, as if you must eat that;
nor think that I command you to drink sensible and corporeal Blood: But know,
that the very Words that I have spoken to you are Spirit and Life. So that
these very Words and Speeches of his, are his Flesh and Blood; whereof whosoever is
always Partaker, being nourished as it were with beavenly Bread, shall be a
Partaker of heavenly Life. -- Let not the hasty hearing of those things by me,
-- (...).
of Flesh and Blood, trouble you; for things senfibly heard profit nothing, but
it is the Spirit that quickneth them that can spiritually hear them.

S. Basil (...).
says the same. There is an intellectual Mouth of the inward Man, whereby he is
nourished who receives the Word of Life, which is the Bread that descended from
Heaven:

Facundus Hermian. Lib. 12. Defens. 3. capit. c. 1.
takes this of eating Christ's Flesh to be a Mystery, and that S. Peter when he
answered, Lord, whither should we go? thou have the Words of Eternal Life, did
not then understnad it. For, says he, Quod si mysterium intellexisset, hoc
potius diceret, Domine, cur abeamus non est, cum credamus nos corporis and
sanguinis tui fide salvandos.
if he had understood the Mystery, he should rather have said, Lord, there is
no reason we should go away, fince we believe we shall be saved by Faith in thy
Body and Blood. He means his Death and Passion, which is his Sense of eating
Christ's Body and Blood.

Theodorus Heracleot. Catena in Joan. 6.54, 55.
refers this eating Christ's Flesh to the sincere embracing the Economy of his
Incarnation. These, says he, -- (...).
upon the reasoning of their Minds, by assenting to it, as it were tasting the
Doctrine, do rationally (or spiritually) eat his Flesh, and by Faith partake of
his Blood.

S. Chrysostom Hom. 46. in Joan. (...), etc.
upon those words, It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh profits
nothing, reckons up some of those carnal Doubts that profit nothing; as, It is
a carnal thing, says he, to doubt how Christ descended from Heaven, and to
imagine him to be the Son of Joseph, and how he can give us his Flesh to eat.
All these are carnal, which ought to be mystically and spiritually understood.

Cyril of Jerusalem Catech. Mystag. 4.
says, That the Jews, for want of understanding spiritually Christ's words,
(...)
imagined that Christ exhorted them to devour his Flesh; which is hard to be
distinguished from the Roman Churches Oral Manducation.

This carnal Fancy might well make them shrink, and cry out, This is a hard
Saying, who can hear it? For, as S. Austin Cont. advers. Legis l. 2. c. 9.
Horribilius videatur humanam carnem manducare quam perimere, and humanum
sanguinem potare quam fundere.
well observes, It seems more horrible to eat Humane Flesh, than to kill it;
and to drink Man's Blood, than to shed it.

Origen's Prolog. in Cantic. Est materialis hujus hominis, qui and exterior
appellatur, cibus potusque naturae suae cognatus, corporeus iste, sc. and
terrenus. Similiter autem and spiritualis hominis ipsius, qui and interior
dicitur, est proprius cibus, ut panis ille vivus qui de caelo descendit, etc.
-- Rerum vero proprietas unicuique discreta servatur, and corruptibili
corruptibilia praebentur, incorruptibili vero incorruptibilia proponuntur.
words (for I see no good reason to question they are his) are enough to
convince effectually all such carnal Jews and Christians. There is a Meat and
Drink for this material and outward Man, as we call him, agreeable to his
Nature, viz. this corporeal and earthly Food. There is likewise a proper Food
for the spiritual, or, as we call it, inward Man, as that living Bread that
came down from Heaven, etc. -- But the Property of things is reserved to each
distinct, and corruptible things are given to that which is corruptible, and
incorruptible things are proposed to that which is incorruptible.

Greg. Nyssen Hom. 1. in Cantie. (...), etc.
also well expresses it thus. There is an Analogy betwixt the Motions and
Operations of the Soul and the Senses of the Body, etc.

-- Wine and Milk are judged of by the Taste; -- (...).
but these being intellectual, the Power of the Soul that apprehends them must
be altogether intellectual.

S. Chrysostom Homil. 26. in Matthew. -- (...).
said well, That Christ gave himself to us for a spiritual Feast and Banquet.

And Procopius Gazaeus Comment. in Exodus Coelestis seu divinus Agnus animarum
solet esse cibus.
. The Celestial and Divine Lamb is wont to be the Food of Souls.

S. Austin Tract. 1. in Epist. Joan. -- Ipsum jam in coelo sedentem manu
contrectare non possumus, sed fide contingere.
indeed tells us, We cannot handle him who now sits in Heaven; yet, says he, we
may touch him by our Faith.

For, as he says elsewhere Tract. 26. in Evang. Joan. Non ad Christum ambulando
currimus, sed credeudo: nec motu corporis, sed voluntate cordis accedimus. --
Sic se tangi voluit, sic tangitur ab eis a quibus been tangitur, ascendens ad
patrem, manens cum patre, aequalis patri.
, We run to Christ, not by walking, but by believing; nor do we approach him by
the Motion of our Bodies, but by the Will of our Hearts.

And afterward. -- Thus he would be touched, and thus he is touched by all
that rightly touch him, ascending to the Father, remaining with the Father,
equal to the Fath. r.

And in the next Tractate Idem Tract. 27. in Joan. Quid est hoc? Hinc solvit
illud quod non noverant -- Illi enim putabant eum erogaturum corpus suum, ille
autem dixit, se ascensurum in coelum, utique integrum. Cum videritis filium
hominis ascendentem ubi crat prius, certe vel tunc videbitis quia non co modo
quo putatis erogat corpus suum, certe vel tunc intelligetis, quia gratia ejus
non consumitur morsibus.
upon those words, What if ye see the Son of Man ascend, etc. What does this
mean? He hence resolves that which they did not know -- For they imagined, that
he would bestow his Body upon them; and he told them, that he would ascend into
Heaven entire and whole. When you shall see the Son of Man ascending where he
was before, then surely you will see, that be does not bestow his. Body after
that manner you think he does: Surely you will then at least understand, that
his Grace is not consumed by bites (of the Teeth)

Gelasius Contr. Eutych. l. 4. Credere in filium Dei, hoc est videre, hoc est
audire, hoc est odorari, hoc est gustare, hoc est contrectare eum.
therefore said well: To believe on the Son of God, this is to see him, this is
to bear him, this is to smell, this is to taste him, and this is to handle him.

These Testimonies, one would think, are sufficient to tell us the Sense of the
Fathers in this Matter; yet, with the Reader's leave, I will add a few
Considerations more, to put it out of all doubt.

1 Consideration. It appears there is no necessity to understand eating and
drinking Christ's Body in the Eucharist, of his natural Body received into
ours; because the Fathers say, We eat and drink, and partake of Christ's Body
and Blood in Baptism, which, by the confession of all, can be done only
spiritually there.
Thus Cyril of Alexandria In Joah. 9.6.
says, The Gentiles could not have shaken off their Blindness, and contemplated
the Divine and H. Light, that is, attained the Knowledge of the Holy and
Consubstantial Trinity, -- (...).
unless by Holy-Baptism they had been made Partakers of his Holy Flesh, and
washed away the blackness of their Sin, and shak'd off the Devil's Power.

And elsewhere Glaphyr. in Exodus lib. 2. (...).
speaking of the Eunuch: He by his Question, says he, showed, that he was
Partaker of the Spiritual Lamb; for he was presently thought worthy of Baptism.

Fulgentius De Bapt. Aethiop. in fine. Nisi manducaveritis carnem filii
hominis, and biberitis ejus sauguinem, non habebitis vitam in vobis. Quod
quisquis non solum secundum veritatis mysteria, sed secundum mysterii
veritatem, considerare poterit, in ipso Lavacro S. Regenerationis hoc fieri
providebit.
. Unless ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye shall have
no Life in you. Which whosoever can consider, not only according to the Mystery
of Truth ( viz. in the Sacraments) but according to the Truth of the Mystery,
will see that this is done in the Laver of Holy Regeneration.

And again Ibid. Nec cuiquam esse aliquatenus ambigendum, tu^^ unumquemque
fidelium corporis sanguinisque participem fieri, quando in baptismate membrum
corporis Christi efficitur.
. Neither need any one in the least doubt, that every Believer is then made
Partaker of Christ's Body and Blood, when he is made in Baptism a Member of
Christ's Body.

Therefore S. Basil In Esa. 3.
says, That the Lord takes away Christ from those who having put him on by
Baptism, -- (...).
by sinning afterward trample upon his Body, and count the Blood of the
Covenant an unholy thing.

2 Consideration. The Fathers, with reference to Eating and Drinking,
distinguish Christ's True Body from his Sacramental one; which they could not
do, if Christ's True and Natural Body and Blood were eat and drunk in a proper
sense in the Sacrament.
S. Chrysostom In 1 Cor. c. 11. v. 29. (...), etc. (...).
expounding those words, He that eats and drinks unworthily, etc. says, As
Christ's Presence, which brought those great and unspeakable Blessings to us,
did condemn those the more that did not receive it; so also the Mysteries make
way for greater Punishments to those that unworthily partake of them.

S. Austin Contr. Faustum l. 20. c. 21. Hujus sacrificii caro and sanguis, etc.
-- in passione Christi per ipsam veritatem reddebatur, post ascensum Christi
per Sacramentum memoriae celebratur.
(whose words I have given Chap. 10. Posit. 2.) makes the Flesh and Blood of
Christ to be exhibited in the Truth at his Passion, and in the Sacrament only
the Memory of it to be celebrated.

Bid In Psalm. 21: -- Intelligent in pane and vino visibiliter sibi proposito
aliud invisibile, scilicet corpus and sanguinem verum Domini, qui verus cibus
and potus sunt, quo non venture distenditur, sed men's saginatur.
upon those words, The Poor shall eat and be satisfied, says, By this Bread and
Wine, which are visibly offered to them, they will understand another invisible
thing, viz. the true Body and Blood of our Lord, which are really Meat and
Drink, not such as fills the Belly, but which nourishes the Mind.

And in another place In Esdram lib. 2. cap. 8. immolatio. Paschae gloriam
insinuet resurrectionis, cum omnes electi carne agni immaculati, id est, Dei
and Domini nostri, non amplius in Sacramento credentes, sed in reipsa ac
verirate videntes, reficiuntur.
speaking of the Passover. The Immolation of this Passover represents the Glory
of our Resurrection, when all the Elect shall eat together the Flesh of the
Immaculate Lamb, I mean of him who is our God and Lord, no more in Sacrament as
Believers, but in the thing it self, and in Truth, as Spectators.

Neither is that of Isidore of Sevil De Officiis Eccles. l. 1 c. 15.
to be passed over, who mentions this Prayer in the Liturgy of his Time; -- Ut
oblatio quae Domino offertur sanctificata per spiritum sanctum, corpori and
sanguini Christi conformetur (not confirmetur, as the last Colen Edition
absurdly has printed it, An. 1617.)
That the Oblation which is offered to God, being sanctified by the Holy
Spirit, may be conformed to the Body and Blood of Christ. Which very Phrase
shows a difference betwixt what we receive in the Eucharist, and the true Body
and Blood of Christ: Else it would not be Conformity, but Identity, as Monsieur
Claude has well observed.

3 Consideration. They say, That the Fathers under the Old Testament did eat
the same spiritual Meat with us; and give this as the Reason why it is
spiritual Meat, Because it is not eaten corporally, but by Faith. Therefore
both they and we must eat the same Meat only spiritually, not corporally.
S. Austin has said so much in this Argument, that I need go no further. And I
might insist upon many Passages I have upon other occasions named before; as
that in his Treatise upon S. John's Gospel Tract. 45. in Ev. Joan. Videte, fide
manente, signa variata. Ibi petra Christus, nobis Christus quod in altari Dei
ponitur. Et illi pro magno Sacramento ejusdem Christi. biberunt aquam
profluentem de petra, nos quid bibamus norunt fideles. Si speciem visibilem
intendas aliud est; si intelligibilem significationem eundem potum spiritualem
biberunt.
, where explaining that of the same spiritual Drink the Fathers drank, he has
such Expressions as these. See the Signs are varied, Faith remaining the same.
There the Rock was Christ (in Sign); to us that which is laid on the Altar is
Christ; and they drank of the Water that flowed from the Rock, for a great
Sacrament of the same Christ; what we drink, the Faithful know. If you regard
the visible Species or Nature, it is another thing; if the spiritual or
intelligible Signification, they drank the same spiritual Drink.

In another place Idem in Psalm. 77. Idem in mysterio cibus and potus illorum
qui noster, sed significatione idem non specie. Quia idem ipse Christus illis
in petra figuratus, nobis in ^^^ne manifestatus est.
. Their Meat and Drink was the same with ours in Mystery; not in Substance (or
Species) the same, but in Signification. Because the same Christ who was
figured to them in the Rock, is manifested to us in the Flesh.

To add but one place more, which fully comprehends the whole sense of the
Argument De Vtilit. Penitentiae, cap. 1.
: Where S. Austin explaining the same words, of our Fathers eating the same
spiritual Meat, etc. he discourses thus.

The Apostle says, Apostolus dicit, Patres nostros, non patres infidelium, non
patres impiorum manducantes and morientes, sed patres nostros, patres fidelium,
spiritalem cibum manducasse, and ideo cundem. -- Erant enim ibi quibus plus
Christus in cord quam Manna in ore sapiebat. Quicunque in Manna Christum
intellexerunt, cundem quem nos cibum spiritalem manducaverunt. -- Sic etiam
eundem potum, Petra enim erat Christus. Eundem ergo potum quem nos, sed
spiritalem, id est, qui fide capiebatur, non qui corpore hauriebatur. -- Eundem
ergo cibum sed intelligentibus and credentibus; non intelligentibus autem,
illud solum Manna, illa sola aqua, etc.
That our Fathers, not the Fathers of Unbelievers, not the Fathers of the
Wicked, that did eat and die; but our Fathers, the Fathers of the Faithful, did
eat spiritual Meat, and therefore the same. -- For there were such there, to
whom Christ was more tasteful in their Heart, than Manna in their Mouth. --
Whosoever understood Christ in the Manna, did eat the same spiritual Meat we
do. -- So also the same Drink, For the Rock was Christ. Therefore they drank
the same Drink we do, but spiritual Drink, that is, Drink which was received by
Faith, not what was swallowed down by the Body. -- They ate therefore the same
Meat, the same to those that understand and believe; but to them that do not
understand, it was only that Manna, only that Water, etc. Here you see, S.
Austin calls that Spiritual Drink which Faith receives, not which the Body
takes down. And thus whether Christ be come, or be to come, it is all one (as he
says a little after, Venturus and venit diversa verba sunt sed idem Christus)
because Faith can apprehend what shall be, as well as what is. But if our
Eating be Christ's natural Body swallowed down our Bodies, then their Meat and
ours were not the same. For Christ could not be thus their Meat, because then
he had not taken Flesh upon him; therefore those old Fathers could not take it
down in the oral Sense.

4 Consideration. The Body and Blood are to be eaten and drunk, and to be
received, as they are represented and set before us in the Sacrament. But there
the Body of Christ (according to the Fathers as well as the Scriptures) is set
before us as broken and dead, and his Blood as poured out of his Veins.
Therefore it can be eaten and drunk by us only figuratively and spiritually.
If the Reader look back to Chap. 10. Posit. 4. he will find a great many
Testimonies, especially out of S. Chrysostom, to prove that the Fathers
considered Christ's Body in the Sacrament as slain and dead, and his Blood
poured out of his Veins, and separated from his Body: And how S. Chrysostom,
at the same time when he tells us that Christ has given us leave to be filled
with his Holy Flesh Hom. 51. in Matthew. -- (...) -- (...).
, he has proposed and set himself before us as slain.

This I shall now give a further account of, seeing the Fathers speak nothing
more plainly and fully than this.

S. Austin In Psalm. 100. Nos de cruce Domini pascimur; quia corpus ipsius
manducamus.
not only tells us in general, That we are fed from our Lord's Cross, because
we eat his Body; but more expressly says Sermon. 9. de 40. edit. a Sirmondo. --
Qui se pro nobis in mensa crucis obtulit sacrificium Deo Patri, donans
Ecclesiae suae Catholicae vitale convivium, corpore suo nos videlicet satians,
and inebrians sanguine.
, That Christ offered himself a Sacrifice for us to God the Father, on the
Table of the Cross, giving to his Catholic Church a vital Banquet, viz. by
satiating us with his Body, and inebriating us with his Blood. But all this, by
looking upon him on the Table of the Cross, sacrificed and slain.

This made Gr. Nyssen Orat. 1. in Resurr. Dom. (...).
say, That the Body of the Victim (speaking of Christ) is not fit for eating,
if it be alive.

And S. Cyprian Lib. 2. Ep. 3. Nec nos sanguinem Christi possemus bibere, nisi
prius calcatus fuisset and pressus.
. Neither should we be able to drink the Blood of Christ, unless it were first
trodden and pressed. Alluding to Grapes in a Wine Press; and that Christ's
Blood must be out of his Veins when we drink it, and so considered by us.

But none of the Ancients has given a fuller Account of this than Hesychius
Com. in Lev. l. 1. -- Carnem ejus, quae ad comedendum inepta erat ante
passionem -- aptam cibo post passionem fecit. Si enim non fuisset crucifixus,
sacrificium corporis ejus minime comederemus. Comedimus autem nunc cibum,
sumentes ejus memoriam passionis.
, who says, That Christ made his Flesh fit to be eaten after his Passion, which
was not fit to be eaten before his Passion: For if he had not been crucified,
we could by no means eat the Sacrifice of his Body. But now we eat Food,
receiving the Memory of his Passion.

And again Ib. l. 2. Sartaginem, Domini crucem, -- accipi oportet, quae etiam
superimpositam Dominicam carnem, esibilem hominibus reddidit. Nisi enim
superimposita fuisset cruci, nos corpus Christi nequaquam mystice percepissemus.
, he compares the Cross to a Gridiron, which when our Lord's Flesh is put upon
it, makes it fit to be Food of Men: For unless it had been laid thus upon the
Cross, we could in no wise mystically have received Christ's Body.

And because this Food, which is thus mystically to be eaten, could not be fit
Food for us, unless Christ was crucified and slain; therefore in several places
he speaks of Christ as slaying himself in the Eucharist (which cannot be
understood properly) before he was slain upon the Cross. says Ib. l. 1.
Praeveniens, seipsum in caena Apostolorum immolavit, quod sciunt qui
mysteriorum virtutem percipiune.
, Christ, by way of anticipation, slew (or sacrificed) himself in the Supper of
the Apostles, which they know that perceive the Virtue of the Mysteries.

Again Ib. l. 2. Prius figuratam ovem cum Apostolis caenans Dominus postea suum
obtulit sacrificium, and secundo sicut ovem scipsum occidit.
. Our Lord first supping upon the figurative Lamb with the Apostles, did
afterward offer his Sacrifice, and a second time, as a Lamb, slew himself.

And now after all these Testimonies and Considerations, which, put together,
demonstratively conclude against any eating of Christ's Body, or drinking his
Blood, but what is spiritual and figurative; I Will put an end to this Chapter
with two remarkable Sayings of S. Austin.

The first is upon the 98 Psalm In Ps. 98.
, where he confutes those who, when our Savior spoke of eating his Flesh, and
drinking his Blood, were offended at this, as an hard Saying; and then
expounding that which Christ added, The words I speak are Spirit and Life, he
makes our Lord speak thus to them: Spiritualiter intelligite quod locutus sum.
Non hoc corpus quod videtis manducaturi estis and bibituri illum sanguinem quem
fusuri sunt qui me crucifigent. Sacramentum aliquod vobis commendavi,
spiritualiter intellectum vivificabit vos; and si necesse est illud visibiliter
celebrari, oportet tamen invisibiliter intelligi.
Understand spiritually what I have spoken. You are not to eat this Body which
you see, nor to drink that Blood which they shall shed that will crucify me. I
have commended a certain Sacrament to you, which if spiritually understood,
will give Life to you; and if it be necessary this Sacrament should be visibly
celebrated, yet it must be invisibly ( i. e. spiritually) understood by you. No
Protestant could choose Words to express his Mind more fully by, in this Matter.

His other Saying is against the Manichees, who fansied a latent Christ in the
Fruits of Trees, and Ears of Corn, and professed to eat him that was passible
with their Mouths. S. Austin thus sarcastically derides them Contr. Faustum l.
20. c. 11. Ore aperto expectatis quis inferat Christum, tanquam optimae
sepulturae, faucibus vestris.
: Ye expect with open Mouth, who should bring in Christ into your Jaws, as the
best Sepulcher for him.

If S. Austin had been for Oral Manducation of Christ's Body in the Eucharist,
he could not have had the confidence to have objected this, as a Reproach to
the Manichees, which might so easily have been returned with shame upon himself.

I conclude therefore, that the Trent Fathers, when they called the Sacramental
and Oral Manducation, real eating, to distinguish it from the spiritual eating;
and made that Canon Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 8. Si quis dixerit Christum in
Eucharistia exhibitum, spiritualiter tantum manducari, and non etiam
sacramentaliter ac realiter, anathema sit.
, If any shall say, That Christ exhibited in the Eucharist, is only spiritually
eaten, and not also sacramentally and really, let him be Anathema: that herein
they were so far from designing to testify their Consent with the Fathers
(who, as you have heard, generally say the contrary) that they seem rather to
have had a Conspiracy against them.

CHAP. XIII. The Thirteenth Difference. The Fathers assert, That the Faithful
only eat Christ's Body, and drink his Blood in the Eucharist, not the wicked.
Whereas they of the present Roman Church extend it to both.
THIS Assertion, being a necessary consequence of the foregoing one, will make
my work the shorter for its proof.

What the Church of Rome holds in this matter, cannot be questioned. The Trent
Catechism speaking of such a Person that makes no distinction betwixt the
Sacrament and other common food, expresses it thus Catechis. ad Paroch. Part.
2. n. 27. -- Qui impure sumens corpus Domini, quod in Eucharistia occulte later
--
. -- Who impurely taking the Body of the Lord, which lies hid in the Eucharist
-- there it is hid, they mean, under the species, and the wicked take it.

Therefore Dom. Soto (who was one of the Council of Trent) says In 4. did. 12.
qu. 1. art. 3. -- Est indubie tenendum quod corpus (sc. Christi) descendit in
Stomachum, etiamsi ab iniquo sumatur.
; We must undoubtedly hold, that the Body of Christ descends into the stomach,
though a wicked man takes it.

So Aquinas Part. 3. quaest. 80. art. 3. conclus. Cum corpus Christi in
Sacramento semper permaneat, donec species Sacramentales corrumpantur, etiam
injustos homines Christi corpus manducare consequitur.
. Seeing the Body of Christ always remains in the Sacrament, till the
Sacramental Species are corrupted, it follows, that even wicked men do eat the
Body of Christ.

Alensis Part. 4. Qu. 11. memb. 2. art. 2. sec. 2.
taking notice of the opinion of some that thought that as soon as the Body of
Christ was touched by a Sinners lips, -- Illud sentire erroneum est and
manifest contra sanctos: and ideo communiter tenetur quod in hoc non est
differentia inter justum and injustum, quia uterque ipsum verum corpus Christi
sumit in Sacramento, etc. -- Unde concedendum, quod mali sumunt rem Sacramenti,
quod est corpus Christi verum, quod natum est de Virgin, etc.
it withdrew it self, says, This is an error, and manifestly against the
Saints; and therefore it is held commonly, that in this there is no difference
betwixt the just and unjust, for both of them receive the very Body of Christ
in the Sacrament.

And a little after. It must be granted, that the wicked receive the thing
which the Sacrament is a sign of, which is Christ's true Body, born of the
Virgin, etc.

This ought not to seem a strange Doctrine to be held by those, who say that
brute Creatures may devour Christ's Body. Which is the current opinion.

So Aquinas Loc. citat. ad Tertium. Dicendum, quod etiamsi mus vel canis
hostiam consecratam manducet, substantia corporis Christi non definit esse sub
speciebus, quamdiu species illae manent.
. We must say, that although a Mouse or a Dog should eat a consecated Host, yet
the substance of Christ's Body does not cease to be under the species, so long
as the species remain.

Alensis Ibid. sec. 1. loco citat. Si canis vel porcus deglutiret hostiam
consecratam integram, non video quare vel quomodo Corpus Domini non simul cum
specie trajiceretur in ventrem canis vel porci.
is as positive and more plain. If a Dog or a Hog should swallow a whole
consecrated Host, I see not why nor how the Body of our Lord would not,
together with the Species, be conveyed into the Belly of that Dog or Hog.

It is also remarkable, that among three Articles which P. Gregory XI. an.
1371. prohibited to be taught See Pref. to the determ. of Jo. Paris. p. 32. Si
hostia consecrata a mure corrodatur, seu a bruto sumitur, quod remanentibus
speciebus, sub iis definit esse Corpus Christi, and redit substantia Panis.
under pain of Excommunication (which was also repeated by P. Clement VI.) one
of them was this. If a Consecrated Host should be gnawed by a Mouse, or taken
by a Brute, that then the species remaining, the Body of Christ ceases to be
under them, and the substance of the Bread returns.

This he would not let pass for good Divinity.

Nor can it at this Day, when this is one of the Cautions to be observed in the
Celebrating of the Mass.

De Defect. Missae, sec. 10. n. 5. ante Missal. Roman. Si post confecrationem
ceciderit musca, aut aliquid ejusmodi, and fiat nausea Sacerdoti, extrahat eam
and lavet cum vino, finita Missa comburat, and combustio ac lotio hujusmodi in
Sacrarium projiciatur. Si autem non fuerit nausea, nec ullum periculum timeat,
sumat cum sanguine.
That if a Fly, or any such animal fall into. the Chalice after Consecration,
if the Priest nauseats it, then he must take it out and wash it with Wine, and
burn it when Mass is ended, and the ashes and the wash be thrown into the H.
Repository. But if he do not nauseate to swallow it, nor fears any danger, let
him take it down with the Blood.

What is all this for, but to tell us, that they look upon it still to be
Christ's Blood, and that its better it should be in the Belly of a Priest than
of a Brute?

So also they give us another Case. Ibid. n. 14. Si Sacerdos evomat
Eucharistiam, si species integrae appareant, reverenter sumantur, nisi nausea
fiat: tunc enim species consecratae caute separentur, and in aliquo loco sacro
reponantur, donec corrumpantur, etc.
If a Priest should vomit up the Eucharist, and the species appear entire, they
must be taken down reverently, unless nauseated; but in that case the
Consecrated Species must be cautiously separated, and put in some H. Place,
till they are corrupted, etc.

But I beg the Readers Pardon for presenting him with such nauseous stuff; God
grant that they who thus unworthily represent their Savior, may have grace to
repent, that the thoughts of their hearts may be forgiven them.

As for the Fathers, if by their plain words we can understand their sense,
they assert, that only the Faithful, and not the wicked, eat the Body of
Christ, and drink his Blood in a proper sense

S. Jerome In Oseam c. 8. -- Cujus caro cibus credentium est.
calls the Flesh of Christ the food of Believers.

And Isidore of Sevil In Genes. c. 31. -- Caro ejus qui est esca Sanctorum.
Quam si quis manducaverit, non morietur in aeternum.
that it is the meat of the Saints. And he adds (which makes it their food, and
of none else) which if any one eat, he shall not die eternally. They therefore
often call it the Bread of Life, and Life it self.

S. Ambrose In Psalm. 118. Sermon. 18. Hic est panis vitae: qui manducat vitam
mori non potest; quomodo enim morietur, cui cibus vita est?
. This is the Bread of Life: he that eats Life cannot die; for how should he
die whose Food is Life?

S. Austin says the same Sermon. de verb. Evangel. apud Bedam in 1 Cor. 10.
Quando Christus manducatur; vita manducatur -- quando manducatur reficit.
. When Christ is eaten, Life is eaten. -- When he is eaten he refreshes.

Again in another place Sermon. 44. de Diversis. Filii Ecclesiae habent a rore
coeli and fertilitate terrae, etc.

-- a fertilitate terrae omnia visibilia Sacramenta. Visibile enim Sacramentum
ad terram pertinet. Haec omnia communia habent in Ecclesia boni and mali. Nam
and ipsi habent, and participant Sacramentis, and quod norunt fideles a tritico
and vino.


distinguishing the Portion of Saints and Sinners, he makes the true Sons of
the Church to partake both of the Dew of Heaven, and the fatness of the Earth.
This fatness of the Earth he explains to be all visible Sacraments, for they
pertain to the Earth. All these, he says, the good and bad in the Church have
in common. For the bad have and partake of the Sacraments, and what the
Faithful know made of Bread-Corn, and Wine.

If then the visible Sacrament, and that which has its original from Earth, be
all that evil men partake of, to be sure they have nothing to do with Christ,
the Heavenly Bread, or his Body, which (to use his Phrase) does not pertain to
Earth at all, but is a Divine Food.

Which none has more admirably and fully spoke to than Origin In Matthew. c. 15.
v. 15. p. 253. Ed. Huet. (...).
. Who having said a great deal about Christ's Typical and Symbolical Body (which
S. Austin called before the visible Sacrament) he goes on thus. Many things
also might be said concerning that word which was made Flesh, and the true
Food, which whosoever eats shall surely live for ever, no wicked Man being
capable of eating it. For if it were possible, that a wicked man, continuing
such, should eat him that was made Flesh, seeing he is the Word, and the living
Bread, it would not have been written, That whosoever eats this Bread shall
live for ever.

This is that which Macarius Homil. 14.
discourses of so largely and piously. Telling us, that as a great rich Man,
having both Servants and Sons, gives one sort of meat to the Servants, -- (...)
-- (...) --
and another to the Sons that he begot, who being Heirs to their Father, do eat
with him. -- So, says he, Christ the true Lord, himself created all, and
nourishes the evil and unthankful; but the Children begotten by him, who are
partakers of his grace, and in whom the Lord is formed; -- (...), etc.
he feeds them with a peculiar refection, and Food, and Meat and Drink, above
and besides other men, and gives himself to them that have Conversation with
their Father, as the Lord says, He that eats my Flesh, and drinks my Blood,
abides in me, and I in him, and shall not see death.

With whom S. Jerome In c. 66. Esaiae. Dum non sunt sancti corpore and spiritu,
nec comedunt carnem Jesu, neque bibunt sanguinem ejus, de quo ipse loquitur;
Qui comedit carnem meam and bibit sanguinem meum, habet vitam aeternam.
agrees, speaking of voluptuous men; Not being holy in Body and Spirit, they
neither eat the Flesh of Jesus, nor drink his Blood; concerning which he says;
He that eats my Flesh, and drinks my Blood, has Eternal Life.

S. Austin also Contra Donatist. post collat. c. 6. De ipso pane and de ipsa
Dominica manu, and Judas partem and Petrus accepit.
says. Of that Bread, and from our Lords own Hand, both Judas and Peter took a
part.

But then he Tract. 59. in Joan. Evang. Illi manducabant Panem Dominum, ille
Panem Domini contra Dominum, illi vitam, ille poenam.
makes the distinction himself, that Judas received only the Bread of the Lord,
when the other Disciples received the Bread that was the Lord. Which is
directly contrary to Transubstantiation; for according to that, even such a one
as Judas, must eat the Lord, and no Bread, when this Father says, that he ate
the Bread and no Lord.

Neither is S. Austin singular in this Phrase of the Bread of the Lord, to
signify the real substance of that Element that is eaten in the Sacrament, and
not the proper Body of Christ.

For so S. Jerome uses it In Jerem. c. 31. Confluent ad bona Domini super
frumento, de quo conficitur Panis. Domini.
. When he speaks of Corn, of which the Bread of the Lord is made.

It is also very observable, that as the Council of Trent (as we heard before)
makes eating Christ Sacramentally and really to be the same, and spiritual
eating to be of another sort, not real, but one would think, rather imaginary.
On the quite contrary, the Fathers distinguish the sacramental eating from the
real, and make the spiritual and real eating to be the same; and they will
grant that a bad Man may eat Christ Sacramentally (that is, in sign) but not
really; for so none but the faithful can do it.

For thus S. Austin Sermon. 2. de verb. Apost. Tunc autem hoc erit, id est, Vita
unicuique erit Corpus and sanguis Christi, si, quod in Sacramento visibiliter
sumitur, in ipsa veritate spiritualiter manducetur, spiritualiter bibatur.
. Then will this be, that is, the Body and Blood of Christ will be Life to
every one, if that which is visibly taken in the Sacrament, be in the Truth it
self spiritually eaten, and spiritually drank.

Which in another place Tract. 26. in Joan. Quod pertinet ad virtutem
Sacramenti, non quod pertinet ad visibile Sacramentum.
he expresses by the visible Sacrament, and the virtue of the Sacrament.

Again most expressly De Civit. Dei. l. 21. c. 25. Ipse dicens, qui mandacat
carnem meam and bibit sanguinem meum in me manet and ego in eo, ostendit quid
sit, non Sacramento. tenus, sed revera Corpus Christi manducare and sanguinem
ejus bibere.
. Christ saying, He that eats my Flesh and drinks my Blood, dwells in me,
and I in him, shows what it is, not sacramentally, but really and in truth, to
eat Christ's Body, and drink his Blood.

And therefore in the same Chapter Ibid. Neque enim isti dicendi sunt manducare
Corpus Christi, quoniam nec in membris computandi sunt Christi.
speaking of wicked men, he says. Neither can they be said to eat the Body of
Christ, since they are not to be accounted Christ's Members.

S. Austin again distinguishes the Sacramentum rei (the Sacrament of the thing)
from the res Sacramenti, the thing of which it is a Sacrament. Tract. 26. in
Joan. Hujus rei Sacramentum -- in Dominica Mensa praeparatur and de Dominica
Mensa sumitur, quibusdam ad vitam; quibusdam ad exitium. Res vero ipsa cujus
and Sacramentum est, omni homini ad vitam, nulli ad exitium quicunque ejus
particeps fuerit.
The Sacrament of this thing -- is prepared on the Lords Table, and received
from the Lords Table, to some to Life, and to others to destruction. But the
thing it self of which it is a Sacrament, is for Life to every one that
partakes of it, and to none for destruction.

For as S. Chrysostom Catena in Joh. 6.49. (...).
phrases it, He that receives this Bread, will be above dying?

I will conclude this Chapter with two remarkable places of St. Austin.

The first is cited by Prosper Lib. Sentent. ex August. sententia (mihi) 341.
vel 339. Escam vitae accipit and aeternitatis poculum bibit, qui in Christo
manet and cujus Christus habitator est. Nam qui discordat a Christo, nec carnem
ejus manducat, nec sanguinem bibit; etiamsi tantae rei Sacramentum ad judicium
suae praesumptionis quotidie indifferenter accipiat.
who has gathered S. Austin's Sentences. He receives the food of life, and
drinks the Cup of Eternity, who abides in Christ, and in whom Christ inhabits.
For he that disagrees with Christ, neither eats his Flesh nor drinks his Blood;
although he takes indifferently every day the Sacrament of so great a thing to
the Condemnation of his presumption.

The other place is, upon the sixth Chapter of S. John Tract. 27. in Joan. in
initio. Exposuit (Christus) modum attributionis hujus and doni sui, quomodo
daret carnem suam manducare, dicens, Qui manducat carnem meam, and bibit
sanguinem meum, in me manet and ego in illo. Signum quia manducat and bibit,
hoc est, si manet and manetur, si habitat and inhabitatur, si haeret ut non
deseratur.
. Christ, says he, expounded the manner of his assignment and gift, how he gave
his Flesh to eat, saying, He that eats my Flesh and drinks my Blood,
dwells in me and I in him. The sign that he eats and drinks is this, if
he abides in Christ and Christ in him, if he dwells in him and is inhabited by
him, if he cleaves to him so as not to be forsaken by him.

And he concludes with this Exhortation Ibid. prope finem. Hoc ergo totum ad
hoc nobis valeat, dilectissimi, ut carnem Christi and sanguinem Christi non
edamus tantum in Sacramento, quod and multi mali; sed usque ad Spiritus
participationem manducemus and bibamus, ut in Domini corpore tanquam membra
maneamus, ut ejus spiritu vegetemur, etc.
. Let all that has been said, Beloved, prevail thus far with us, that we may
not eat Christ's Flesh and Blood in Sacrament (or sign) only, but may eat and
drink as far as to the participation of the Spirit, that we may remain as
Members in our Lords Body, that we may be enlivened by his spirit, etc.

CHAP. XIV. The Fourteenth Difference. Several Vsages and Practices of the
Fathers relating to the Eucharist, declare, That they did not believe
Transubstantiation, or the Presence of Christ's Natural Body there; whose
contrary practices or forbearance of them, in the Roman Church, are the
Consequences of that belief. As also some things the present Roman Church
practices, because they believe Transubstantiation, and the Corporal Presence,
and dare not neglect to practice, so believing; which yet the Ancient Church
did forbear the practice of, not knowing any obligation thereto; which plainly
argues their different Sentiments about the Eucharist in those Points.
IT is possible this Argument may have as good an effect to open Men's Eyes, as
any I have urged before, though, I think, I have urged very cogent ones. For though
some Men have a Faculty eternally to wrangle about the Words and Sayings of
others, and to shift off an Argument of that kind, yet they cannot so easily
get rid of an Objection from Matter of Fact, and a plain Practice. I shall
therefore try, by several Instances of Usages and Forbearances, in the cases
abovenamed, whether we may not see as clearly as if we had a Window into their
Breasts, that the Ancient Church, and the present Church of Rome, were of
different Minds and Opinions in this Matter.

1. Instance.

It was a part of the Discipline of the Ancient Church, to exclude the
uninitiated, (Catechumens) the Energumeni, (acted by evil Spirits) and
Penitents, from being present at the Mysteries, and to enjoin all that were
present to communicate.

It is so known a Case, that the Deacons in the Churches cried aloud to bid
such depart, as I before named, when they went to the Prayers of the Mass,
(which was so called from this dismission of Catechumens, Penitents, etc.) that
I shall not stay to prove it. (See the Constitutions attributed to Clemens, l.
8. cap. 6, 7, 9, 12. and S. Chrysostom, Hom. 3. in Ep. ad Ephesians.)

By the same Laws of the Church, those that remained, after the exclusion of
the rest, were all to communicate; whom the Author of the Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy, under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite Hurarch. Eccles. c. 3.
(...).
calls, Persons worthy to behold the Divine Mysteries, and to communicate.

For this (because it is not so universally acknowledged as the former) I shall
refer the Reader to the Second Canon of the Council of Antioch Can. 2. Council.
Antioch. -- (...), etc.
, which says, That they which enter into the Church of God, and hear the Holy
Scriptures, and do not communicate in Prayers with the People, or turn away
from receiving the Eucharist through any disorderliness, are to be cast out of
the Church, till they confess their Sin and repent, etc.

Which is the same in sense with that Canon Canon. Apostol. 9. (...).
which is very ancient, (though not Apostolical, as it pretends) That all the
Faithful that enter, and hear the Scriptures, and do not continue at Prayer,
and also at the Holy Communion, are to be separated, as those that bring
disorder into the Church.

S. Chrysostom discharges a great deal of his Zeal as well as Eloquence,
against those Persons that were present at the Eucharist, and did not
communicate Chrysostom. Hom. 3. in Ep. ad Ephesians. (...). --
In vain, he tells them, does the Priest stand at the Altar when none
participates; in vain is the daily Sacrifice. -- He minds them, that the Crier
had said indeed, -- (...).
That those that were in penitence (or penance) should depart -- but thou, says
he, art not of that number, but of those that may participate (i.e. -- (...) --
not being hindered by any Church Censures as Penitents were) and regardest it
not. -- (...); -- (...).
He says, That the King at the Marriage-Supper, did not ask, Why did thou sit
down? but why did thou enter? And adds, That whosoever (being present) does
not receive the Mysteries, stands there too boldly and impudently. The rest is
well worthy the reading in that Homily.

Gregory the Great also tells us, Dialog. l. 2. cap. 23. Si quis non
communicate, det locum.
it was the custom in his Time, for a Deacon to cry aloud, If any do not
Communicate, let him depart. There must be no Spectators, that is, unless they
were Communicants. For as Justin Martyr Apolog. 2. Of (...).
acquaints us, it was the usage of his Time, That the the Deacons reach to
every one present of the consecrated Bread, and Wine, and Water, that they may
communicate.

If we now look upon the practice of the Roman Church, we shall find all quite
contrary. There they may have as many Spectators as please to come, when there
is but one alone that receives the Eucharist, I mean the Priest. Any one that
knew nothing of the Matter, would conclude, when he saw their Masses, that they
came thither about another Business ordinarily, than to eat and drink in
remembrance of their Savior; which was the only use that the Ancients
understood of it. They considered it as a Sacrament, by Institution designed to
represent Christ's Passion and Crucifixion; these consider the presence of his
Glorified Body and his Divinity there, and are taken up with adoration more
than any thing else. That they will not abate, every day you are present, when
the Host is shown for that end: But as for the other, the receiving of the
Eucharist, they are satisfied if it be done but once a Year. The Ancients
looked upon it as an Invitation to a Table, where the Sacrament was to be their
Meal; but here you are called to look upon the King present, and sitting in
state; and chiefly to take care that, upon the Sign given, all may fall down
together and worship him.

S. Chrysostom Loc. citat. (...);
calls it, a contumely against him that invites one to Feast, to be present and
not to partake of it; and asks, Whether it had not been better for such a one
to have been absent?

But the Council of Trent was of another mind, and their Opinion is Conc. Trid.
Sess. 22. c. 6. Non propterea Missas illas in quibus solus sacerdos
Sacramentaliter communicate, ut privatas and illicitas damnare, sed probare,
atque adeo commendare.
, That those Masses in which the Priest communicates sacramentally alone, are
not to be condemned as private and unlawful, but to be approved and commended.

And not content with this, they thunder out an Anathema Ibid. Can. 8. Si quis
dixerit Missas, in quibus solus sacerdos Sacramentaliter communicate, illicitas
esse adeoque abrogandas, anathema sit.
against those that say, (and let S. Chrysostom look to himself) that such
Masses are unlawful and to be abrogated.

At these Masses the Novices and Catechumens may be present, and no Deacon
cries out to them to withdraw; for though indeed they may not eat, yet they may
worship: And the Penitents that were excluded, while their Penance lasted, from
so much as seeing the Sacrament in the Ancient Church; in this Church, the
oftener they come for this purpose, the more welcome; and by direction, when
public Penance has been enjoined, the Holy Altar has been the place chosen
before which to perform it; as their Annals Annal. Japon. ad An. 1579.
tells us of one Sangunus, a noted Courtier in Japan, that for the expiation of
a Crime, came and fell down at the Altar, in the Church of the Royal City, and
there before the Holy Sacrament, clawed his Back with Scourges so long, as one
of the Seven Penitential Psalms was recited.

These Practices, though so contrary to one another, are yet natural enough, and
well-suited to the Principles of each Church; but then, it is plain, their
Principles and Opinions concerning the Sacrament, were widely different; and
that such things were never practiced of old, was not because Christians then
wanted their Devotion, but their Faith.

2. Instance.

A second practice of the Christian Church of old, was, giving the Communion in
both kinds; the Cup, that is, as well as the Bread; though now, by a Law of the
Roman Church, (in the Council of Constance and Trent) abolished.

That the ancient Practice was to deliver it in both Kinds, has been often
proved by Learned Men on our side, and particularly by an excellent late
Dicourse against the Bishop of Meaux Discourse of the Communion in one kind, in
Answer to the Bishop of Meaux 's Treatise.
upon this Subject; and has been also acknowledged by the Learned Men of the
Roman Communion, such as Cassander, Wicelius, Petavius, etc. Which makes it
needless to insist further upon the proof of it.

We are sure it continued thus even to the Age when Transubstantion was
established by the Lateran Council, since we find a whole Army of Charles King
of Sicily, (as the Historian Apud Du Chisn. Tom. 5. Hist. Franc. p. 840.
citante Dallaeo, de cultib. Latin. lib. 5. c. 12. Cum exercitus esset in
procinctu, Decanum Meldensem, associatis sibi Monachis, corpus and sanguinem
Christiregiis militibus dedisse.
tells us) just before they went to the Fight against Manfred, Ann. 1265. (or
1266, as other Historians will have it) all received the Body and Blood of
Christ. Aquinas agrees, That it was the ancient Custom of the Church, That all
that communicated of the Body, communicated also of the Blood In Joan. 6.
Propter periculum effusionis.
But for to prevent spilling the Blood, he says, in some Churches the practice
is, that the Priest alone communicates in the Blood, and the rest in the Body
of Christ.

We see then about what time this grand Sacrilege, as P. Gelasius calls it
Speaking of some Persons that taking the Body, abstained from the Cup of the
Holy Blood, says, Aut integra Sacramenta percipiant, aut ab integris arceantur,
quia divisio unius ejusdemque mysterii sine grandi Sacrilegio non potest
pervenire. Apud Gratian. decrit. 3. part. 2. did.
of dividing one and the same Mystery, made a more public entry into the
Church; it was, when Transubstantiation had been newly made an Article of
Faith; and it was very natural, that this practice should, within a while, by
easy steps, be a Consequent of that. For Transubstantiation makes Christ's
Flesh and Blood (the same which he took of the Virgin, and which he had when he
was crucified) to be actually and corporally present in the Eucharist, and that
in a glorified State, to which Divine Adoration is due; this is apt to beget a
profound Veneration, and a mighty Concern, lest any thing contumelious should
happen to that which Men justly account so very precious. Now it being certain,
that the Blood which is under the Species of Wine, is subject to those
Casualties, by reason of its fluidity, which the other Species is not so liable
to; and that in the glorified State, the Body and Blood are inseparable; and
therefore that one Species (viz. that of the Bread) contains under it both the
Body and Blood together; what could be more agreeable to such Sentiments as
these, than that Men should willingly part with their Right, in a Matter
wherein they seem not to be much wronged (being only deprived of a few
Accidents of Wine, when the Blood was secured to them) to secure the Honor of
their Savior. It is true indeed, that the Stream of the contrary Custom, made
it difficult to remove that at once, notwithstanding this danger of effusion of
the Blood, which they had been wont in all preceding Ages to receive; therefore
the Wits of Men being set on work by a new Transubstantiating Doctrine, found
out some new Devices, practiced first in the Cells of the Monks; but
afterward, about the time of Berengarius, brought into the Churches to secure
that dreadful Danger, and yet not deprive the People of communicating in the
Blood of Christ.

One was the Device of Intinction, or steeping the Bread in the Wine, and thus
receiving both at once, which as Card. Cusanus informs us Epist. 3. ad Bohem.
Non parva altercatio in principio mutationis illius prioris -- tamen
universalis Ecclesia, quia ita tempori congruebat, populum cum intincto pane
communicare permisit.
though it went not down without great contention at the first change from the
old Practice, yet the Universal Church, complying with the Times, permitted it.

But it was not long it was thus suffered, for by a Decree of Pope Urban 2. in
the Council of Clermont, and by an enforcement of it by his Successor P.
Paschal 2. (whose Epistle to Pontius Abbot of Cluny concerning this Matter,
Baronius has given us Baronius Append. ad Tem. 12. ad An. 1118.
) this practice was abrogated.

A second Device also, about the same time, was brought into play, Of sucking
the Consecrated Wine through little Pipes or Canes (called Pugillares) like
Quills; concerning which Cassander (de communione sub utraque) gives us an
account, and that some of them were to be seen in his Time. And indeed, this
seems to be a sufficient security to the danger of Effusion, and also prevents
that great Offense of any drops of Blood sticking to the Beards of People when
they drank out of the Cup: and yet even this would not satisfy, nor any thing
else be a sufficient Caution against the profanation of the Blood, but only
debarring the People wholly of it. Yet this way is still used by the Pope
himself, (and I think he has the sole privilege to do it) who in that which is
called the Missa Papalis, when he himself celebrates and communicates, he sucks
part of the Blood through a golden Quill Cum pontifex Corpus Christi sumpserit,
Episcopus Cardinalis porrigit ti calamum, quem Papa ponit in Calice in manibus
Diaconi existente, and Sanguinis partem sugit. Sacrarum Cerimon. lib. 2. cap.
de Missa Majori, Papa personaliter celebrante.
.

But neither does he always thus communicate, for their Book of Sacred
Ceremonies acquaints us, Ibid. cap. Si Papa in nocte Nativitatis personaliter
celebrat, Non sugit sangainem cum calamo, sed more communi.
That when He celebrates personally on the Night of the Nativity of our Lord,
that all things are observed, that are described in the Papal Mass, except that
he communicates at the Altar alone, and not in his eminent and high Seat, and
does not suck the Blood with a Quill, but takes it after the common manner.

But now, after all, what account can we give of the Ancient Fathers? they
apprehended it necessary to receive in both Kinds in all their Public
Communions, and so they practiced. Must we not then accuse them, either of
great Dullness, or Indevotion? either that they wanted Sagacity, in not
apprehending the imminent danger they in their way exposed the Blood of Christ
to; or that they were guilty of a strange carelessness and indifferency, in not
preventing it by any of those Methods which the Roman Church has found out to
do it? Truly, for my part, I am inclined to have as great, if not a greater
opinion of them, in both respects, (especially for their Devotion) than I can
have of the Roman Church; and I am the more persuaded hereto, because the
Apostles themselves must come in to the side of the Ancient Church, their
practice being the same: not to insist upon the Deference that ought to be paid
to that Holy Spirit that we are sure acted them; who if there had been any such
real danger of profanation, by receiving in both kinds, or ever was likely to
be any such, would not have failed to have given directions to them how they
should avoid it; and we cannot think the Apostles would not have set down those
Directions to us in some of their Writings. But they have not done it; no not
the Zealous St. Paul, who yet says so much to the careless Corinthians about
this Argument, and tells them, that they came together, not for the better, but
the worse; charges them with unworthy receiving, and being thereby guilty of
the Body and Blood of the Lord, (1 Cor. 11.) and that for this cause many were
weak and sick among them, and were judged of the Lord for their prophanations,
etc. But this is none of the Charges against them, nor does he direct them to
any of the wise Methods of the Roman Church for preventing this Danger; though he
says, What he received of the Lord he delivered to them.

There is nothing then remains, but that we assign the true Cause of this
different Practice; which can be none other, but the Roman Churches innovating
in their Faith about the Sacrament, and altering so their Opinions about the
Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist, that they require a different
Conduct for their Devotion; so that neither the Practice of the Primitive
Fathers, nor the Rules of the Apostles, will suit and agree with their
Persuasions and Apprehensions. But now the Faith of the Ancient Church in this
Matter was such, as neither requires nor can admit of any Alteration like what
the Church of Rome has made in communicating the People only in one Kind. For,
as I have before proved, they looked upon this Sacrament, not as an actual
Exhibition and Presentation of the Natural and Glorified Body of our Savior,
which they believed to be absent and contained in the Heavens, but as a
Representation of his Crucified Body, where his Blood was separated from his
Body, and poured out of his Veins; and that not only the Elements, but the
Sacramental Actions of breaking the Bread, and pouring out the Wine, and our
eating and drinking were instituted to show forth this painful Death of our
Lord, and the shedding of his most precious Blood for the Remission of Sins.

By the presence of his glorified Body there, (as the Roman Church believes)
this cannot be done, no breaking, nor no parts to be made of that, nor no
separation of Blood, as out of the Body. But all can be done in the
Representative Body of Christ, which is the Eucharist, all the Ends of the
Institution can be there fully effected, and the Sacrifice on the Cross, in
this Image of it, made present to our Faith, and to our Minds, and set livelily
before us; and by the Effects of this upon our Hearts, while we partake of the
Elements, through the powerful Grace of God's Holy Spirit, we may be prepared
to receive all the Blessed Fruits and Benefits of his Passion.

According to these Persuasions, it is plain, there can be no abatement of
communicating in the Cup; because, without that, there is no representation of
a Crucified Body; for the distinct partaking of the Blood, (not as supposed to
be contained and received in the other Species) is that which alone shows (as I
said before) the separation that was then made of his Body and Blood.

3. Instance.

Another Practice of the Roman Church differing from the Ancient, is, The
Elevation of the Eucharist, that all present may at once adore it. For thus the
Missal Ritus celebr. Missam cap. 8. Dicit, hoc est enim Corpus meum, Quibus
prolatis, celebrans Hostiam tenens inter pollices and indices -- genuflexus eam
adorat. Tunc se erigens, quantum commode potest, elevat in altum Hostiam, and
intentis in eam oculis (quod in Elevatione Calicis facit) populo reverenter
ostendit adorandam.
directs, That when the Priest comes to the words of Consecration, and has
said, This is my Body; then holding the Host, (as he is directed) he kneels
down and adores it. Then raising himself as high as he is able, he lifts up the
Host on high, and fixing his Eyes upon it, (which he does also in the Elevation
of the Cup) he shows the Host reverently to the People to be adored.

This is the present Practice; which the Council of Trent Sess. 13. c. 5.
Nullus dubitandi locus relinquitur, quin omnes Christi fideles pro more in
Ecclesia Catholica semper recepto, latriae cultum qui vero Deo debetur, huic
sanctissimo Sacramento in veneratione adhibeant.
endeavors to countenance, by telling us, That there is no doubt but that all
Christians, according to the Custom always received in the Catholic Church,
ought to give the Worship of Latria (which is supreme Worship) to the most Holy
Sacrament in their worship of it.

By which Sacrament (as their best Interpreters explain it) is meant, Totum
visibile Sacramentum, all that is visible there, (together with Christ) and is
one entire Object, consisting of Christ and the Species, and must be together
adored. But whatsoever, besides Christ who is invisible, is visible there, call
it what you please, is a Creature; and I am sure the Ancient Church never
practiced the adoration of any such; and it is strange impudence to talk of the
Custom of the Catholic Church in this Matter. Neither can it be shown, by any
good Testimonies of the Ancients, that this their Elevation, in order to
Adoration, was ever used by them: No not so much as any Elevation for any
purpose, is mentioned by those Fathers, who on set purpose have given an
account of the Rites of communicating in the first Ages of the Church, neither
by Justin Martyr, nor the Author of the Constitutions called Apostolical; nor
Cyril of Jerusalem, nor the pretended Denis the Areopagite, or any other before
the Sixth Century.

A dilligent Searcher of Antiquity, tells us Dallaeus de relig. cult. object.
l. 2. c. 5.
, That he cannot find, among all the Interpreters of Ecclesiastical Offices in
the Latin Church, the mention of any sort of Elevation before the Eleventh
Century, (that is, the Age of Innovation in the Faith about the Eucharist).

As for the Greeks of later date, in them we may meet indeed with an Elevation
of the Eucharist, but for quite other purposes than Adoration. One of the Ends
of their Elevation, is mentioned by Germanus Patriarch of Constantinople In
Tom. 2. Bibl. Pat. Gr. Lat. -- (...).
, which was, to represent Christ lifted up upon the Cross, and his Death upon
it, and the Resurrection it self.

Another reason they give is, by the showing of this Food of the Saints, to
invite and call them to partake of it. Which Nic. Cabasilas gives a full
account of In Expos. Liturg. apud Bibl. Pat. Gr. Lat. Tom. 2. (...).
, saying, That after the Friest has been partaker of the sanctified Things, he
turns to the People, and showing them the Holy Things, ( i. e. the Bread and
Wine) calls those that are willing to communicate. Or, as he still more fully
explains it, The Life-giving Bread being received (by the Priest) and shown, he
calls those that are likely to receive it worthily, saying, Holy Things are for
the Holy (...).
. Behold the Bread of Life which ye see. Run therefore you that are to partake
of it; but it is not for all, but for him that is Holy, etc.

It is certain then, that the Roman Practice (when for Adoration they elevate
and show the Host) is an Innovation; and that it proceeded from the Novel
Doctrines then set on foot in the church, is highly probable; not only because
they commenced about the same time; but also because their practice suits so
exactly with, and springs so freely from those Doctrines, it being so natural,
when such a glorious Body as our Savior's is believed to be made present where
it was not before, to be wholly taken up with thoughts of Adoration and Worship
above any thing else; as it is notoriously true in this Church, where the main
End of the Eucharist, viz: communicating in the Body and Blood of Christ is
strangely neglected; and they are more concerned, in carrying the Sacrament in
Processions, in praying to it before their Altars, in preparing splendid
Tabernacles where it may repose, decking and adorning the places of its
Residence, and the like, than in engaging Men to receive it; which was the main
thing the Ancient Church designed, that they might worthily partake of it; and
when this was not designed, their way was wholly to conceal it.

4. Instance.

Another Practice of the Roman Church, different from that of the Ancient
Church, is, that now the Communicants Hands are unimployed in receiving the
Eucharist; and all is put by the Priest into their mouths.

Their Hands indeed may bear a part in their Adoration and showing some Signs
of that, but otherwise they are useless. For now since Christ's Body is
believed to lie hid under the Species of Bread and Wine, that is thought too
sacred to be touched by the Hands of any, but the Priests. We may therefore
conclude fairly, that if the Fathers had not this care to forbid this touching
by the Peoples Hands, they had not this Faith of the Roman Church, that the
Natural Body of Christ is in the Eucharist: since if this had been their
Opinion, in all probability their practice would have been the same, Since that
they had an equal concern for their Savior's Honor, cannot well be doubted of.

Now that they gave the Sacrament into the Peoples Hands, for the space of
eight hundred Years or more, is clear by their Testimonies. Of which I Will
mention only three or four out of an hundred that might be given.

Clemens of Alexandria Stromat. lib. 1. (...).
says, That when the Priests have divided the Eucharist, they permit every one
of the People to take a portion of it.

Tertullian Lib. de Idol. Cap. 7. -- Eas manus admovere Corpori Domini, quae
Daemoniis corpora conferunt.
reproaches the Christian Statuaries, That they reached those hands to the
Lord's Body, which had made Bodies for Devils.

St. Ambrose Apud Theodoret. Hist. Ecclesiast. Lib. 5. c. 19. -- (...);
Story is a known one, how he repelled Theodosius from the Holy Table, after
the slaughter he had made at Thessalonica, with these words; How will thou
extend thy hands, yet dropping with the Blood of an unjust slaughter? How with
those hands will thou receive the Lord's most Holy Body?

He that will consult Cyril of Jerusalem's 5th Mystagogical Catechism, will
find him there directing the Communicant how to order his Hands and Fingers in
taking the Sacrament into them. Which a Roman Master of the Ceremonies would
not have said a word about, being only concerned about the Mouth.

That this manner of receiving was used in the 9th Century, appears by the
Capitulary of Carolus Mag. Capit. Car. M. Lib. 7. Placuit ut omnes qui Sacram
acceperint Eucharistam, and non fumpserint, ut sacrilegi repellantur.
who ordered, That all that received the Eucharist ( acceperint, that is, into
their Hands) and did not take it ( sumpserint, that is, into their Mouths)
should be kept back as sacrilegious Persons. If they had received it by their
Mouths only, this distinction could not have been made.

5. Instance.

Another Practice, very unagreeable with the belief of Transubstantiation, is
this, That the Ancient Church was not afraid to administer the Eucharistical
Wine in Glass Vessels and Cups: though now it would be a great Crime in the
Church of Rome to do so.

For that Ancient Practice, I might urge that of Tertullian Lib. de pudicit. c.
7, and 10. Procedant ipsae picturae calicum vestrorum, si vel in illis
perlucebit interpretatio pecudis illius, utrumne Christiano an Ethnico
peccatori de restitutione conliniet.

Cap. 10. -- At ego ejus Pastoris. Scripturas haurio, qui non potest frangi.


, who reflecting upon the Church's Indulgence to Sinners, mentions the Picture
of the Shepherd carrying the Lost Sheep on his Back, drawn on the Chalices,
which might be seen by all, being pellucid.

To which he opposes, afterward, the Scriptures of that Shepherd that could
not be broken.

As also that of St. Jerome Epist. 4. ad Rusticum. Nihil illo ditius, qui Corpus
Domini canistro vimineo, sanguinem portat in vitro.
, where speaking of S. Exuperius, he says, Nothing is richer than he who
carries the Lord's Body in a wicker Basket, and his Blood in a Glass.

But it is needless to add more Testimonies, because the thing is confessed by
Baronius Notis ad Martyrol. Romans in August. 7.

A temporibus Apostolorum vitreus Calix in usu fuisse videtur.


, in his Notes upon the Acts of S. Donatus, who confesses, That Glass Chalices
seem to have been in use from the Times of the Apostles. And says a great deal
more than I have mentioned, to confirm it.

And that this Custom continued long in the Church, may be concluded from
hence, That Baronius can find no earlier prohibition of it, than that of the
Council of Rhemes, which he says was held in the Days of Charles the Great. I
have nothing to do with the Commendation he adds of this Prohibition, (being
concerned only in the Matter of Fact) saying, That it was very laudable; but I
do not think it was so merely for his Reason, [ob periculum quod immineret
materiae fragili] because of the imminent danger in such brittle Matter. For if
the Custom was as ancient as the Apostles, how came they to want that quick
Sense the Roman Church now has to prevent that Danger? But we may be certain,
that they, and the Church after them, that used such Glasses, had not the
present Persuasions of this Church, about a hidden Deity, and the latent
glorified Flesh and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist, else they would have had
both the Discretion and Devotion to have provided him a better place of
reception.

Now they have done it in the Canon Law Can. ut Calix. did. 1. de Consecrat.

-- De aere aut aurichalco non fiat Calix, quia ob vini virtutem aeruginem
parit, quae vomitum provocat. Nullus autem de ligneo, aut vitreo calice
praesumat missam cantare.


, enjoining, that the Cup and Patent be, if not of Gold, at least of Silver,
(allowing only Pewter in case of great Poverty) but in no wise the Cup must be
of Brass or Copper, the virtue of the Wine causing a rust that procures
Vomiting, (which yet one would think the Blood of Christ, where there is no
Wine, should not cause) but over a Wooden or a Glass Cup, none may presume to
say Mass. All is very agreeable to their several Persuasions.

6. Instance.

To this let me add another Instance, more difficult still to be reconciled
with the belief of Transubstantiation, viz. The mixing the Blood of Christ with
Ink, for writing things of moment. So I call the consecrated Wine, according to
the usual Language of the Fathers, giving it the name of Christ's Blood; but
it is not possible to believe that they who thus used it, thought it to be so,
any otherwise than by representation: since you can hardly think of a higher
profanation, by any mixture, than this, of blending the true Blood of Christ
with Ink, unless I except the case of mixing it with Poison, for the
destruction of Persons; and thus P. Victor 2. and P. Victor 3. and Henry 7.
Emperor, all died by receiving Poison in the Sacrament, as is attested by
numerous and credible Historians.

Taking it therefore for granted, that no Body will have the confidence to
assert, that they who thus mixed it with Ink, did believe Transubstantiation, I
shall now set down three remarkable Instances of a Pope, a General Council, and
a King, that thus used it.

The first is of Pope Theodorus, who as Theophanes (whose words Baronius Ad an.
D. 648. Sec. 14.
has given us) relates, when Pyrrhus the Monothelite departed from Rome, and
was come to Ravenna, and returned like a Dog to his Vomit; and when this was
found out, P. Theodorus Calling a full Congregation of the Church, came to the
Sepulcher of the Head of the Apostles, and asking for the Divine Cup, he
dropped some of the Life-giving Blood into the Ink; and so, with his own hand,
made the deposition of excommunicated Pyrrhus. Thus Theophanes.

The next Instance, is, the doing of the same in the Condemnation and
Deposition of Photius Patriarch of Constantinople, by the Fathers of the 4th
Council of Constantinople (which the Romanists call the 8th General Council)
which is thus related by Nicetas in the Life of Ignatius Apud. Council. Labbe.
Tom. 8. page 1231. (...).
. The Bishops subscribed his Deposition, not with bare Ink, but, which may make
one tremble (as I have heard it attested by those that knew it) dipping the Pen
in the very Blood of our Savior; thus they condemned and exauthoriz'd Photius,
and with him, all that had been ordained by him. All this was Anno. Dom. 869.

The last Example is, of a Peace or Agreement struck up between Charles the
Bald, and Bernard count of Barcelona, in in the same Age, related by Odo
Aribert; (whose Fragment Baluzius has given us) Notis ad Agobardum, p. 129.
who tells us, That Agreement at Toulouse, was confirmed and signed between the
King and the Count, Sanguine Eucharistico, with the Blood of the Eucharist.
Though notwithstanding this Charles stabbed Bernard with his own hand.

7. Instance.

The next Instance shall be, The different Practices of the Ancient Church and
the Present Roman, with reference to the Reservation of the Eucharist, after
the Communion was ended, and what they did with the Remains not received.

Concerning which, for methods sake, I shall refer all to three remarkable
differences.

1. Difference.] What was not received in the Eucharist by the Communicants,
the Ancient Church took no care to reserve it; But the new Roman Church
reserves all publicly that is unreceived, and puts little of it to any uses
that are Sacramental.

I will not say that there was no reservation of the Remains, after the
Eucharist was over, of what had been consecrated, and not received, even before
the Innovations took place, which were introduced by the Roman Church, because
there may perhaps be some Instances given of communicating the Sick out of such
Remains; and among the Greeks there was also communicating, ex
praesanctificatis, of what had been consecrated before; but these, I say, were
but later Customs of the 6th and 7th Centuries, and both before and after the
contrary Custom did prevail; and where these Reservations were, they employed
them to the ends of the Sacrament, for to be eaten and not to be adored.

But as to the most Ancient Custom of the Church, it is truly given by the
Author of the Commentary upon S. Paul's Epistles, among S. Jerome's Works Tom.
9. Edit. Froben. in 1 Cor. 11. In Ecclesia convenientes suas separatim
offerebant, and post communionem quaecunque eis de sacrificiis superfuissent,
illic in Ecclesia communem coenam comedentes pariter consumebant.
. Who on those words of S. Paul (1 Cor. 11.) This is not to eat the Lord's
Supper, etc. says thus, Meeting in the Church, they separately made their
Oblations, and after the Communion, whatsoever remained of the Sacrifices there
in the Church, eating a common Supper, they consumed them together.

But when these common Meals ceased, and this way of consumption with them; The
Ancient Church had other ways to do it. Witness the Practice mentioned by
Hesychius Lib. 2. in Levit. cap. 8. Quod nunc videmus in Ecclesia sensibiliter
fieri, ignique tradi quaecunque remanere contigerit inconsumpta.
, who explaining that place of the Law, which required, That whatsoever of the
Flesh and Bread remained, should be burnt with Fire; adds, which we see also
now sensibly done in the Church; that whatsoever happens to remain (of the
Eucharist) unconsumed, is burnt.

Evagerius Histor. Lib. 4. c. 36. (...) -- (...) -- (...).
mentions another different usage, but with the same effect, at Constantinople,
where, he says, It was an old Custom, that when a great deal of the Holy Parts
of the Immaculate Body of Christ our God remained, they sent for some Youths
that went to School, of an unripe Age, who eat them up.

Nicephorus Callistus says, That this continued so to his Time, and that he
himself had been one of those Youths that ate up those Particles Lib. 17. Hist.
c. 25.
.

Neither was this a Practice of the Eastern Church only, but also of the
Western, as appears by a Canon of a Synod of Mascon Council. Matiscon. Can. 6.
apud Tom. 5. Conc. Labb. p. 982. Quaecunque reliquiae Sacrificiorum, post
peractam Missam in Sacrario supersederint, quarta and sexta feria innocents,
ab illo cujus interest, ad Ecclesiam adducantur and indicto eis jejunio easdem
reliquias conspersas vino percipiant.
, An. 505. Whatsoever Relics of the Sacrifices shall remain in the Repository
after Mass is ended, on Wednesdays and Fridays the Officer shall bring little
Children to Church, and appointing them to Fast, they shall receive the said
Remains sprinkled with a little Wine.

If Transubstantiation had been their Belief, these had been lewd Prophanations
of the Lord's Body.

The Roman Church therefore having this Belief, have ordered Matters quite
otherwise, all is reserved that remains; the Pretense I know is, that they may
have the Sacrament always in readiness to communicate the Sick withal; but they
have been often told, that this is altogether needless, when the Priests with
their portable Altars, have leave, upon less Occasions, to celebrate Mass
privately; and when so many hundred Masses in the great Churches are daily
celebrated, how easily may the Sacrament immediately (without being reserved)
be conveyed from one of their Altars to such sick Persons.

But whatsoever is pretended, they intend other things more suitable to that
Presence, which they suppose to be there included; stately Tabernacles they
prepare upon the Altars for his repose, with lighted Torches burning Day and
Night before it; they come thither, even out of the Times of the Assemblies to
make their Prostrations; for so Card. Bellarmine De cultu Sanct. l. 3. c. 4. S.
Quinta ratio.

Quia in Templis ordinary praeter Dei praesentiam, quae est ubique, est etiam
praesentia Mediatoris Christi corporaliter in Eucharista, quae certe auget spem
and fiduciam orantis.


, among the Encouragements to make private Prayers in Temples, gives this as
one Reason, because ordinarily in them, besides the Presence of God which is
every where, there is also the Presence of Christ our Mediator corporally in
the Eucharist, which increases the Hope and Trust of him that prays.

This is a new way of increasing Faith and Hope, which the Ancients were not
acquainted with; they waited indeed at the Altar for that end, when the
Eucharist was administered, and the evident representation and setting forth of
Christ before their Eyes as crucified, was very proper to increase their Faith
and Hope: And there in a Sacramental Sense, while they thus received, in the
Phrase of Optatus Lib. 6. adv. Donatist. Quid vos offenderat Christus, cujus
illic per certa momenta corpus and sanguis habitabat?
, the Body and Blood of Christ did inhabit for certain Moments. But these
certain Moments will not do the Business of this Church, which requires a more
constant and fixed Residence. They do not think their very Temples holy and
venerable enough without it; for among the things that make a Temple so, and
moreover endue it with a kind of a Divine Virtue, the forenamed Cardinal Ibid.
cap. 5. sec. Tertio probatur.
reckons the presence of the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. So that it seems
by their Opinions and Practice, the reserved parts of the Sacrament, are as
necessary as those that are received.

Especially if you remember that these reserved Parts are designed, not only to
receive their Adorations, when they come to say their Prayers before it in the
Churches, but also when it travels abroad, as it does upon many occasions, when
none have occasion to receive it, nor think of saying their Prayers, being
engaged in the Streets about their Secular Affairs; yet even there, when they
happen to meet the Eucharist going in a solemn Procession, they must kneel and
adore it. We know also that there is a peculiar Feast instituted (though of a
late Date, An. 1264.) on Corpus-Christi Day, on which, with the greatest pomp
and state imaginable, it is carried about the Streets and public Places to be
seen and worshipped. Not to mention some extraordinary contingences, such as
the breaking out of a great Fire suddenly, occasioning the drawing it out of
its Retirement, to oppose against and stop its fury.

Besides, the Pope himself has often need of the reserved Host, not to Take and
eat (according to the Institution) but to take along with him when he, in his
Pontificals, rides to any Church, or takes a Journey to a City, this always
accompanies him; and the Book of Sacred Ceremonies, will give you an account of
the Horse, and the color of it, upon which it is set, with the Bell about his
Neck, and the pompous Train, the Canopy carried over it, and lighted Torches
before it, etc.

Let me only add farther, That in that case which is pretended to be the great
occasion for the reservation of the Eucharist, I mean, to be in readiness for
sick Persons, yet even here the Procession, and the Pomp, and the Magnificence
in the conveying it to such Places, and the Receiving the Adorations of all it
meets, seems to be as much designed, as the communicating those sick Persons;
which they will be contented as soon to let alone, as to abate those attending
Ceremonies.

The Ancient Church had very homely practices; they used and suffered, in cases
of great necessity, things that this Church would account incongruous if not
profane. Such as that which Dionysius of Alexandria Apud Eusebius. Hist. Eccles.
l. 6. c. 44.
relates concerning old Serapion, who when he lay a-dying, sent a young
Grandchild of his to call one of the Presbyters of Alexandria to give him the
Sacrament: Who by reason of Ilness, not being able to go along with him, he
made no more ado, but took a little portion of the Eucharist, and gave it into
the Youth's Hand, and directed him to moisten it, and so to infuse it into his
Mouth; which he did, and immediately upon the swallowing it, the old Man
expired: I Question, whether the Gentlemen of the Roman Church will allow this
to be a true Communion; but I believe, with their persuasions, they would not
follow it for a World.

We may more than guess so, by a remarkable Story Nic. Trigautius tells us of
what was resolved upon by the skilful Jesuits, in a Case exactly like the
former Nic. Trigautii exped apud Sinas, l. 5. c. 7. p. 503. Neque domi loco
convenienti celebrari poterat, neque pro majestate per vicos deferri:
solabantur igitur illum socii necessaria peccatorum confessione perfunctum,
posse sine viatico, quod legitime impeditus minime susciperet, coelestem
gloriam introire.
, at Pekin in China; One Fabius who had been converted and baptized, being
above Eighty Years old, fell sick to Death; and having been confessed of his
Sins, with great earnestness, desired to receive the Sacrament for his
Viaticum; but there being no convenient place at his House to celebrate it in,
nor liberty to carry it through the Streets in Pomp and requisite State, they
comforted him with the consideration of his having made confession of his Sins,
which was necessary; and told him that he might, without taking the Sacrament,
when he was lawfully hindered, go to Heaven; and so they left him. These
admirable Casuists, you see, determine against communicating the dying Person,
when it could not be performed with the majestic Ceremonies they desired.

The Priest of Alexandria, and the Fathers in China, differ very widely in
their Practice, and you may be sure their Persuasions in this matter were as
different; the Man himself indeed, he tells us, found a way to get the
Communion at last, by throwing himself into their House, but it was not till
they had made a little Procession within doors; till the Tapestry was spread on
the Floors, and the Tapers lighted, nothing could be done.

In a word, to persuade People of the necessity of these Pomps and Solemnities
in conveying the Sacrament to the Sick, they produce several Miracles See the
School of the Eucharist, Title, Asses and Mares, etc.
, how when the Priests have carried the Eucharist through Fields without
attendance, Troops of Asses and Mares have run to supply this defect, and
having first fallen down on their Knees to worship the Deity he carried, they
have accompanied him to the Place, waited at the sick Man's Door till all was
over, and then marched back again in good order with him; God showing, by these
respects paid to it by Beasts, what he expected much more from Men.

2. Difference, relates to what was received in the Eucharist; wherein we also
see a plain disagreement in the usages of the Primitive, and the present Roman
Church. Which is this; The Ancient Church allowed great Liberty privately to
reserve what had been publicly received in the Eucharist: Which would be now a
great Crime in the Roman Church; so far from being allowed.

It is undeniable, that anciently this was allowed, (whether they did well or
ill in it is not at all the question, but concerning the Matter of Fact.) S.
Basil Epist. 289.
thinks that the Custom took its rise from Times of Persecution, when
Christians were forced to flee into Deserts, and live in solitude, having not
the presence of a Priest to communicate-them, they had the Sacrament reserved
by them, and communicated themselves. But he says (even when this Reason
ceased) this became afterward an inveterate Custom. And in Alexandria and
Egypt, the Laics commonly had the Sacrament by them in their own Houses Ibid.
(...). -- (...), etc.
; and, he says expressly, this which they so reserved (...), with all liberty
(as his Phrase is) was a Particle received from the Priest's Hand in the Church.

So Nazianzen Orat. 11. (...), etc.
says of his Sister Gorgonia; Whatsoever of the Antitypes of the precious Body
and Blood of Christ her Hand had treasured up, etc.

Which very phrase intimates, that at several times she had reserved and made a
collection of the Consecrated Elements.

Tertullian supposes it a common practice in his time, when he says Lib. 2. ad
Vxor. Non sciet maritus quid secreto ante omnem cibum gustes, etc.
, Thy Husband will not know what it is thou tastest secretly before all other
Meat, etc.

It is true indeed that in the Councils of Saragosa and Toledo in Spain, this
was prohibited in the 4th Century, upon occasion of the Priscillianists, who
did receive the communion as others did, and reserved it, and so could not be
discovered, though they never took it; against whom Learned Men think those
Councils made those Canons, which anathematized those that received, but did
not take it down, but reserved it. However the foresaid Custom still prevailed
in other Places, as might be shown, if it were needful, as far as the 11th
Century. As for the present Church this is wholly a Stranger to them; they will
have no Remains kept any where but upon the public Altars, where no Hand must
touch them but the Priest's. The Council of Trent Sess. 25. cap. 10.
will not allow the Sanctimoniales, the very Nuns in their Quires, or in any
places within their Cloister (intra chorum vel septa Monasterii) to keep it by
them, but only in publica Ecclesia, notwithstanding any former Grants and
Privileges. And a Great Man Petavius de Poenit. l. 1. c. 7. Si quis nunc Laicus
simile quid auderet, is apud nos censeretur gravi poena expiandi criminis reus,
veluti sanctissimi Sacramenti profanus temerator.
speaking of the former Usages, says, If any Layman now should dare to do so,
he would be accounted guilty of a Crime to be expiated by a grievous
punishment, as a profane Violator of the most Holy Sacrament.

But if it be so great a Crime with them to reserve it when they have received
it; What will they say to the next Difference I shall now mention?

3. Difference. That among the Ancients, what was so privately reserved, was
put to such uses as the present Roman Church must abhor, because they are
direct Affronts to the belief of Transubstantiation, and the corporal Presence.

It appears by S. Cyprian, (libr. de Lapsis) that the very Women in his Time
had liberty to take the Eucharist home with them, and dispose of it as they
pleased; and the Woman he there speaks of, that locked it up in her Chest, had
not the Roman Opinion of a Latent Deity, which such usage ill agrees with, or
rather affronts.

Neither had Cyril of Jerusalem Catech. Mystag. 5. (...).
their Persuasions, when he advises his Communicant, whilst his Lips were wet
and dewy, with what he had drank in the Cup, with his Hands to touch his Eyes
and Forehead, and the rest of the Organs of his Senses for their Sanctification.

But what Gorgonia, Nazianzen's Sister, did with the Remains of the Antitypes
of Christ's Body and Blood, exceeds it; when as he reports of her, to her
commendation Orat. 11. (...), etc.
, she mixed them with her Tears, and anointed her whole Body with it, for the
recovery out of a grievous Disease.

A like Story to which, S. Austin gives us Lib. 3. secundi op. adv. Jul. Neque
hoc permisisse religiosam matrem suam, sed id effecisse ex Eucharistiae
cataplasmate.
of the Mother of one Acatius, who was born with closed Eyes, which a Physician
advised should be opened with an Instrument of Iron; but she refused, and cured
him with a Cataplasm, or Plaster made of the Eucharist.

In honor to our Savior, we find a Woman anointing his Body; but to make his
Body an Ointment for hers, or to make it into a Medicine, is but course usage
of it, and such as none would adventure upon that was persuaded it was a
deified Body.

The old Custom which Eusebius mentions Lib. 5. Hist. Eccles. c. 24. (...).
of fending the Sacrament from one Bishop to another, as a Token of Peace and
Communion, seems to argue but little good Manners, (with the Church of Rome's
Opinions concerning it); for though God sent his Son on a blessed Errand and
Embassy, it look too saucy for us to send him on ours.

What Indecencies would this Church justly fear the Body of Christ would be
subject to, if there were that permission that was granted of old to carry the
Eucharist along with them in their Voyages at Sea? Yet this P. Gregory the
Great tells us was practiced by Maximianus and his Commpanions retuining from
Constantinople to Rome; and being in a Tempest in the Adriatic Sea Dial. l. 3.
c. 36. -- Sibimet pacem dedisse, corpus and sanguinem Redemptoris accepisse;
Deo se singulos commendantes.
They Blood of their Redeemer, recommending every one himself to God.

But that which S. Ambrose informs us Orat. de obitu fratris.
Priusquamperfectioribus esset initiatus mysteriis, in naufragio constitutus --
ne vacuus mysterii exiret e vita, quos initiatos esse cognoverat, ab his
Divinum illud fidelium sacramentum poposcit -- ligari fecit in orario, and
orarium involvit in collo, atque ita se dejecit in mare.
of his Brother Satyrus, was still more bold; Who being Shipwrack'd at Sea, and
not yet having been baptized, lest he should die without the Mystery, he begged
of some of those that were baptized, to let him have that Divine Sacrament of
the Faithful, (the Custom then being to have it reserved about them) which they
granting, he put it up in his Handkerchief which he then tied about his Neck,
and so threw himself into the Sea.

Whatsoever Conceits Satyrus might have when he borrowed it, yet those that
bestowed it, could never think fit (with the foresaid belief) to deliver it
into the Hands of one not yet a perfect Christian, nor to be tied about his
Neck in a cloth that I suppose was no Corporal (as they call it) to be exposed
to the dashing of Sea-waves, like a Bladder or a Cork to keep him from drowning.

But there is a more irreconcilable Practice of the Ancients with the present
Belief, with which I shall end this Particular about reservation of the
Sacrament. It is the Custom of burying the reserved parts of it with their dead
Bodies. The Author of the Life of S. Basil Vita Basil. c. 6. (...).
, tells us, That he kept a Particle of the Eucharist to be buried with him; and
left it so to be by his last Will.

St. Gregory Dialog. l. 2. c. 24. -- Quibus vir Dei manu sua protenus
communionem Dominici corporis dedit, dicers, Ite atque hoc Dominicum corpus
super pectus ejus ponite, and fic sepulturae eum tradite. Quod dum factum
fuisser, susceptum corpus ejus terra tenuit, nec ultra projecit.
tells a strange Story of Youth that was a Monk, who going out of S. Benet's
Monastery without his Benediction, suddenly was found dead; and being buried,
the next day was forced out of his Grave, and a second Time was found so after
Burial: Whereupon, says he, they ran weeping to S. Benet, praying him to bestow
his Blessing upon him. To whom that Man of God gave the Communion of the Lord's
Body, saying, Go and lay this Body of our Lord upon his Breast, and so bury
him. They did so, and then he kept in his Grave, and the Earth threw him out no
more.

I know that there are several Canons of Councils, made against this Practice,
(as the 20th Canon of the Council of Carthage, and the 83 Canon of the 6th
General Council at Constantinople in Trullo); upon which last Canon, Zonaras
observes, (...), etc. That it was an ancient Custom to deliver the Lord's Body
to Dead Bodies.

But then methinks it is very observable, that the reason why the Fathers
prohibit it, is not such a one as would be given in the Roman Church, from the
horrible Profanation and contumely in thus using the Lord's Body (as it would
be if it were truly and properly there, and no Bread remaining): But their
Reason is from hence, Because it is written, Take and eat; But dead Carcases
can neither take nor eat.

But notwithstanding all these Prohibitions, the old Custom continued
afterward; for those that write the Lives of Saints, and tell us of the
translating of their Bodies from one place to another, inform us that they have
found pieces of the Eucharist uncorrupted lying in their Grave: As Surius
Surius vit. Othmar. ad Nev. 16. Eas venerabiliter assumens sacro corpori
apposuit.
tells us in the Life of Othmarus, That when he came to be translated some
Years after he was buried, they found under his Head, and about his Breast,
little pieces of Bread, which were with much reverence laid by his Body again.

The like does Amalarius Di div. Offic. l. 4. c. 41. Oblata super pectus
Sanctum posita, vestimento Sacerdotali indutum, etc.
report, (citing Bid for it) that the same was practiced when S. Cutberd was
buried, his Head bound with a Napkin, the Eucharist laid upon his Holy Breast,
with his Sacerdotal Habit upon him, etc.

It is little less than a Demonstration, that they that thus treated the
Sacrament, did not believe it contained a hidden Deity under the species of
Bread and Wine; for sure they would not then have thus used the Lord of Life
and Glory, to imprison him, as it were, and suffer him to lie buried with the
putrid Carcases of the Dead.

8. Instance.

The last Instance of differing Practices in the two Churches, shall be, In
their over-sollicitousness to prevent any Accidents that might happen in the
Administration of the Eucharist; their Frights when any such thing does happen,
and the Expiations required for negligence to purge such Crimes; such as we
have no footsteps of in any of those cases, in the Ancient Church.

As to the first of those Cases, I have somewhat prevented my self, in what I
before have shown, of their Devices of Intinction, sucking the Sacrament
through Pipes; and, which is worst of all (out of this abundant caution)
denying the People the Cup. Here therefore I shall mention other Cautions, such
as those which tend to prevent any Fragments falling off from the Bread of the
Eucharist, that no Crumbs may have any dishonor done to them, by being left
unregarded, but either may be received or reserved.

To this end, they have altered the Ancient Custom of providing common Bread,
such as is of ordinary use, for the Sacrament, and required that it be
unleavened, because this is less apt to break into Crumbs, and cleaves better
together in its Parts. And though they do not say that there is no Sacrament
where leavened Bread is used, yet the Missal De defectibus, c. 3. n. 3.
Conficiens graviter peccat.
affirms, That he that consecrates in this, does grievously Sin; and herein
they have raised (since the days that Transubstantiation was forming into a
Doctrine of Faith) and maintained a great Controversy with the Greek Church,
which does not use their Azyms, no more than the Anclent Church did. They have
also invented, about the same Time, and still use, those little round Wafers
(as they are commonly called) which is that which they consecrate for the Bread
of the Sacrament, and take care hereby to prevent breaking into Crumbs; for
they never break them for distribution, but put them whole into the
Communicants Mouths; whereas the Ancient Practice was, to provide one whole
Loaf of Substantial Bread, and to divide this into parts, and break it for to
be distributed among them all. But these Hostiolae, little Hosts, are brought
to such a tenuity, that they are the next door to what they call species,
having scarce any substance, and deserve not properly the name of Bread, as a
learned Man Vossius in These. Theol. Disp. 19. de S. Coenae Syusb.
has shown. The very Missal ( Loc. citat. n. 7.) supposes, that they may easily
disappear, and that a Wind may carry them away, for that is one of the cases it
mentions, (aut vento, aut miraculo, vel ab aliquo animali accepta.)

It is easy to show, that all this caution to prevent falling Crumbs, is
perfect nonsense, according to their principles, since the True Body of Christ
cannot be broken or crumbled into Bits, which is the only substance remaining;
the rest, which they call Species, being Mathematical Lines and Colors only,
and no matter under them; a whole World of them can never make up a Crumb of
Bread, or any Fragment. And yet these are they about which such superabundant
Caution is used; which are mentioned in the Missal.

To name a few. When the Priest that celebrates does communicate himself, it is
then only that he breaks the Host into three parts, one of which he puts into
the Cup; and after he has taken the other two which are upon the Patin, he is
directed Missal. Ron. ritus celtor. Missam, c. 10. Sect. 4.
to take the Patin, to view the Corporal, (or Cloth spread under it) to gather
up the Fragments with the Patin, if there be any on it, and with his Thumb and
Forefinger of his right Hand, to wipe the Patin carefully over the Chalice,
and also his Fingers, lest any Fragments remain on them.

Then for the Hosts that are reserved to another time, after the Priest has
taken them off from the Corporal, and put them into the Vessel appointed for
them, he is directed to mind carefully Ibid. Sect. 15.
, lest any Fragment, the lest imaginable, remain upon the Corporal; and if
there be any, carefully to put them into the Chalice.

When he has taken the Cup, with the 3d Particle of the Host put into it Ibid.
Sect. 5.
, he must purify himfelf, drinking some wine poured into the Cup by the
Minister that attends; then with Wine and Water must wash his Thumbs and
Fore-fingers over the Cup, and must wipe them with the Burificatory; then he
must drink off the Oblation (wherein he washed) and wipe his Mouth and the
Chalice with the Purificatory.

Suchlike also are the Cautions given when the People have communicated Ibid.
Sect. 6.
. If the Hosts were laid upon the Corporal, the Priest wipes it (or sweeps it)
with the Patin; and if there were any Fragments on it, he puts them into the
Chalice. The Minister also holding in his right Hand a Vessel with Wine and
Water in it, and in his left a little Napkin (Mappulam), does reach the
Purification (to wash their Mouths) to them, a little after the Priest, and the
little Napkin to wipe their Mouths.

The Communicants also are directed See the Romans Ritual, de S. Eucharist.
, after receiving, not presently to go out of the Church, or talk, or look
about carelessly; nor to spit, nor read aloud Prayers out of a Book, left the
Species of the Sacrament should fall out of their Mouths.

All this is preventing Care: But now when Accidents do happen, they seem, by
their ordering Matters, to be in a frightful Concern; and strange things are to
be done, if possible, to make an honorable amends.

In the last Chapter I have given the Reader some Instances of those strange
Things, and will here only add two Cases which the Roman Missal provides for.

The first is, If a Consecrated Host, or any part of it, should fall to the
Ground, the direction is Missal. Ram. de defect. Misae, c. 10. Sect. 15.
, That it be reverently taken up, and the place where it fell must be cleansed,
and a little scraped away, and such dust or scrapings must be put in the Holy
Repository. If it fell without the Corporal upon the Napkin (Mappam) or any
ways upon any Linen Cloth, such Napkin, or Linen, must be carefully washed, and
that Water poured out into the Holy Repository.

The second Case is, When by negligence Ibid. c. 10. Sect. 12.
any thing of the Blood is Spilt. If it fell upon the Earth, or upon a Board,
it must be licked up with the Tongue, and the place scraped sufficiently, and
such scraping be burnt, and the Ashes laid up in the Repository. But if it fell
upon the Altar-stone, the Priest must sup up the Drop, and the place be well
washed, and that water cast into the Repository. If it fell upon the
Altar-Cloths, and the Drop sunk as far as the second or third Cloth, those
Cloths must be thrice washed where the Drop fell, putting the Cup underneath to
receive the Water, and that Water thrown into the foresaid place. And so it
directs to such washing when it falls upon the Corporal alone, or the Priest's
Garments, etc.

I cannot but here annex also the Constitution which the Reader may find in the
Appendix to the History of the Church of Peterburgh, Page 344. (being the first
of two there set down) directing what is to be done, when any negligence
happens about the Lord's Body and Blood, and how to expiate the Crime.

When there is so great negligence about the Lord's Body and Blood, that it
happens to fall downward, or into any place where it cannot be fully perceived,
whether it fell, and whether any of it came to the Ground; Let the Matter be
discovered as soon as may be to the Abbot or Prior, who taking some of the
Friars with him, let him come to the place where this has happened; And if the
Body shall have fallen, or the Blood have been spilt upon Stone, or Earth, or
Wood, or Mat, or Tapestry, or such like, let the dust of the Earth be gathered,
part of that Stone be scraped, part of that Wood, Mat, Tapestry, or the like,
be cut away and cast into the Holy Repository. But if the place where it is
thought chiefly to have fallen, let there be the like gathering, Scraping,
cutting away, and casting into the Holy Repository. Then they by whose
negligence this has happened in the next Chapter shall humbly declare their
Fault, and on their naked Bodies receive Judgment (judicium nudi suscipiant)
and Penance be enjoined them, either of Fasting, or Whipping, or Rehearsing so
many Psalms, or such like. Which Persons going back to their places, from their
Punishment (de judicio) all the priests then present shall rise up, and with
all devotion offer themselves to receive Punishment. Then he that holds the
Chapter, shall detain seven of them, which he pleases to choose, to receive the
Judgment (of whipping) and command the rest to go away. The Chapter being
ended, all prostrating themselves together, shall say seven Penitential Psalms
in the Monastery, beginning to sing them as they go out from the Chapter. Then
shall follow after the Psalms, the Pater Noster, with these Chapters and
Collects. Let thy Mercy, O Lord, be upon us. Remember not our Iniquities. The
Lord be with you. Let us pray. Hear, O Lord, our Prayers, and Spare the Sins of
those that confess themselves to thee; that they whose guilty Consciences do
accuse them, thy merciful Pardon may absolve them. Or that other Collect. O
God, whose property is always to have Mercy; or such other collect for Sirs.

But if the Blood fell upon the Corporal, or upon any clean Cloth, and it be
certain whether it fell, let that part of the Cloth be washed in some Chalice,
and the first Water it was washed in be drunk off by the Friars; the other two
washings be cast into the Repository. The said Fault must be discovered in the
first Chapter, but they alone, by whose negligence this has happened, shall
receive the foresaid Discipline, but all the Friars shall say over in the
Monastery all the seven Psalms, with the Chapters and Collects, as was said
before. If that day, the short one for the Dead shall be read in the Chapter,
let them first sing my words going into the Church: After that the seven
Psalms, as aforesaid. But if in any other manner a lighter negligence shall
happen relating to this Sacrament, the Friar, by whose Fault it happened, shall
be punished with a lighter Revenge at the discretion of the Abbot or Prior.

Thus I have given a sufficient Specimen of the strange Caution and Fears the
Roman Church are under, lest any thing should happen, even to the very least
Particle or Drop of the Sacrament, that is dishonorable: And indeed, their
Caution is very agreeable to their Persuasions, as I have before often hinted.

But now if we turn our Eyes upon the Ancient Church, though we cannot question,
either their Devotion or reverent Behavior in all Acts of Religious Worship,
and particularly in this great One; yet there is not to be found any such
scrupulosities about minute things; nor such frightful apprehensions in the
case of unforeseen Accidents, nor such Expiations as we have before heard of.
They did not forbear to use the Common Bread (as I said before) though it might
be more liable to crumble; they took their Share from one Common Loaf; they
received the Wine without intinction, or sucking it through Pipes, etc. Which
are all later Inventions, since the Faith was innovated concerning the
Eucharist.

But because this is only a Negative Argument, I will therefore add a Positive
one, to demonstrate that the Ancients were far from these Scrupulosities; and
also that they came into the Church with Transubstantiation, and not before;
viz. The Practice of Communicating Infants. It is not my Business here to
prove, that this was the common Usage in the Church, from the Times of S.
Cyprian at least, even to later Ages, which has been done effectually by others
See Mr. Chillingworth 's Additional Treatises, in 4 to.
, and is acknowledged by our Adversaries.

Maldonate Comm. in Joan. 6.53.
the Jesuit owns, that it continued in the Church for six hundred Years.

And Card. Perron De loc. August. c. 10.
grants, That the Primitive Church gave the Eucharist to Infants as soon as
they were baptized: And that Charles the Great, and Lewis the Pious, both
testify that this Custom remained in the West in their Age, that is, in the 9th
Century in which they lived. But it went down lower, even to two Ages after
Charles the Great. For that Epistle of P. Paschal 2. (which I mentioned in
another Chapter) given us by Baronius, at the end of his last Tome, ( Ad Ann.
1118. when that Pope died) wherein he forbids Intinction of the Bread in the
Wine, and requires that the Bread and Wine should be taken separately; gives us
also this exception, ( praeter in parvulis ac omnino infirmis qui panem
absorbere non possunt) that it may be allowed to little Children, and those
extremely weak, that cannot get down the Bread: Which had been a needless
provision for them, if Infants had not then received the Sacrament.

This being then a certain and confessed thing, that Infants received the
Eucharist, I refer it to the Conscience of any Romanist, whether he can think
the Ancients had any of their aforesaid Fears, and nice Scrupulosities, about
the Accidents that might happen to the consecrated Elements, which in that
Practice could not be prevented; it being impossible, where sucking Children
receive either Bread or Wine, to hinder the happening of something which the
Church of Rome will call highly dishonorable to the Sacrament. For to instance
in a Case which S. Cyprian Lib. de Lapsis.
mentions, of a Christian little Girl, that by her Nurses Wickedness had
received polluted Bread in an Idol's Temple, and afterward was brought by the
Mother, knowing nothing, into the Church to receive the Communion. He relates
how the Child, when its turn came to receive the Cup, turned away its Face,
shut its Lips, and refused the Cup. But the Deacon Ibid. Perstitit Diaconus,
and reluctanti licet de Sacramento Calicis insudit. Tunc sequitur singultus and
vomitus; in Corpore atque ore violato Eucharistia permanere non potuit.
persisted, and though it strove against it, did infuse into it of the
Sacrament of the Cup. Then followed sighing and vomiting; the Eucharist could
not remain in a Body and Mouth that had been profaned.

How would a Romanist start at the thoughts of pouring the Sacrament, as this
Deacon did (who sure was a Zuinglian) into the Mouth of a struggling Child? But
here is no mention of any concern about that, or what happened upon it; from
whence it is natural to conclude, that the Ancients in this common Case having
none of this Church's Scruples and Fears, that they had none of their Faith;
for they must have had more Caution, if they had had their Opinion about the
Eucharist.

It is also very observable, to confirm what I have said, that though we can
trace the Custom of Communicating Infants, as far as to the Age when the
Transubstantiating Doctrine was set on foot, and ready to be formed into an
Article of Faith; yet here we are at a full stop, and can go no further, for
this begat such Scruples and Fears, that made this quickly give place and
vanish, which had so many Hazards attending it, and we hear no more of it since
that in the Latin Church; but other great Churches, that have not made This an
Article of their Faith, still retain the old Custom (though they err therein)
of Communicating Infants. As the Greek Churches, the Muscovites, Armenians,
Habassins, Jacobites, etc. concerning which see Dallee de Cultib. Latin. l. 5.
c. 4. Thomas a Jesu de Convers. gentium, l. 7. c. 5. and c. 18. Ludolfi Histor.
Aethiop. l. 3. c. 6. Sect. 37, 38. Histor. Jacobitarum, Oxon. cap. 9. See also
Father Simons Critical History of Religions, concerning the Georgians, cap. 5.
p. 67, 71. Nestorians, p. 101. Cophties, p. 114. Armenians, c. 12. p. 128.

CHAP. XV. The Fifteenth Difference. The Old Prayers in the Canon of the Mass
concerning the Sacrament, agree not with the present Faith of the Roman Church:
And their New Prayers to the Sacrament have no countenance from the Ancient
Church.
IT is to no purpose to enquire, who was the Author of the Canon of the Mass,
when Wallafridus Strabo De reb. Ecclesiast. cap. 22. Quis primus ordinaverit
nobis ignotum est.

Auctum tamen fuisse, non semel sed saepius ex partibus additis intelligimus.


(who lived in the middle of the 9th Century) tells us, It was a thing to him
unknown. Seeing also he adds, That it had been enlarged, not only once but
often; it is as vain to ask after its Age.

The same also the Abbot Berno Berno Ab. Augiens. de rebus ad Missam spectant.
c. 1. Attamen ipsum Canonem non unus solus composuit totum, sed per tempora
aliud alius interposuit vel adjecit.
says, It was not one Man that composed the Canon all of it, but at several
times another interposed and added another thing.

And as they added, so also I doubt not but they altered many things, as we may
guess by that remarkable Difference, betwixt what the Author of the Book of
Sacraments, under the name of S. Ambrose Lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 5. Fac nobis
hanc Oblationem adscriptam, rationabilem, acceptabilem, Quod est Figura
corporis and sanguinis Domini nostri Jesu Christi.

Quam Oblationem tu Deus in omnibus quaefumus benedictam, adscriptam, etc.
facere digneris, Vt nobis corpus and sanguis fiat dilectissimi tui Filii D. N.
J. Christi.


, cites as the Prayer in his Time, and what we now find in it. (speaking of the
Oblation) it was, then, Make this Oblation to us allowable, rational,
acceptable, Which is the Figure of the Body and Blood of Christ our Lord: Which
now is turned into this Prayer, That the Oblation may be made to us the Body
and Blood of thy dear Son our Lord.

But yet to take the Canon as now it is, we shall find the Prayers of it, not
capable of being reconciled with the present Faith of the Roman Church, and
with Transubstantiation.

To give some Instances.

Thus they pray in the Canon, immediately after the words of Consecration. Can.
M^ss. Unde and memores, Domine, nos servi tui, sed and plebs tua sancta ejusde^
Christi Filii tui D.N. tam beatae passionis, necnon and ab inferis

Panem sanctum vitae aeternae, and Calicem salutis perpetuae.

Supra quae propitio ac sereno vultu respicere digneris: and accepta habere,
sicuti accepta habere dignatus e^ munera pueri tui justi Abel, and sacrificium

Supplices te rogamus, omnipotens Deus, jube haec perferri per manus sancti
Angeli tui in sublime Altar tuum, in conspectu Majestatis tuae, ut quotquot ex
hac altaris participatione Sacrosanctum Filii tui corpus and sanguinem
sumpserimus, omni benedictione coelesti and gratia repleamur. Per eundem J.
Christum D. N.

Nobis quoque peccatoribus -- partem aliquam and societatem donare digneris cum
tuis sanctis Apostolis -- intra quorum nos consortium, non estimator meriti sed
veniae, quaesumus, largitor adinitte. Per Christum D. N.

Per quem haec omnia, Domine, semper bona creas, sanctificas, vivificas,
benedicis and prastas nobis.




Wherefore we, O Lord, thy Servants, and yet thy Holy People, being mindful, as
well of the Blessed Passion, as also of the Resurrection from the Dead, and of
the glorious Ascension into Heaven, of the same thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ;
do offer to thy most excellent Majesty, out of thy own Donations and Gifts, a
pure Sacrifice, an Immaculate Sacrifice, the Holy Bread of Eternal Life, and
the Cup of Everlasting Salvation.

Upon which (Gifts) vouchsafe to look, with a propitious and serene Aspect: and
to accept them, as thou did vouchsafe to accept the Gifts of thy Child, the
Righteous Abel, and the Sacrifice of our Patriarch Abraham; and the Holy
Sacrifice, the immaculate Hostie, which thy High Priest Melchisedeck did offer
to thee.

Almighty God, we humbly beseech thee, command these things to be carried by
the Hands of thy Holy Angel to thy High Altar, before thy Majesty, that as many
of us, as by this partaking of the Altar, have received the most holy Body and
Blood of thy Son, may be filled with all Heavenly Benediction and Grace, by the
same Jesus Christ our Lord.

Vouchsafe also to bestow on us Sinners -- some part and society with thy Holy
Apostles, etc. -- into whose society we entreat thee to admit us, not weighing
our Merit, but bestowing Pardon on us. Through Christ our Lord.

By whom, O Lord, thou do always create, sanctify, quicken, bless, and bestow
on us all these good things.

Immediately after all have communicated, this follows. What we have taken with
our Mouth, Quod ore sumpsimus, Domine, pura mente capiamus: and de munere
temporali fiat nobis remedium sempiternum.
O Lord, may we receive with a pure Heart: and of a temporal Gift, may it be
made to us an Eternal Remedy.

While the Priest is washing his Thumbs and Fore-fingers over the Cup, with
Wine and Water, and wiping of them, he is bid to say; Corpus tuum, Domine, quod
sumpsi, and sanguis quem potavi, adhereat visceribus meis: and praesta ut in me
non remaneat scelerum macula, quem pura and sancta refecerunt Sacramenta.

Qui vivis, etc.


Let thy Body, O Lord, which I have taken, and thy Blood which I have drunk,
cleave to my Entrals, and grant that the stain of my Crimes may not remain in
me, whom pure and Holy Sacraments have refreshed.

Who live, etc.

All these Prayers I have cited, the Reader must remember are after
Consecration; upon which immediately, according to the present Faith of the
Roman Church, the Substance of Bread and Wine is destroyed, and nothing but the
Species and Shadows of them remain; and now Christ, instead of them, becomes
present there in his Body, and Soul, and Divinity. This is their Faith. But it
is impossible to reconcile this to those foregoing Prayers. For at the
beginning of the Canon, they pray, Supplices rogamus ac petimus uti accepta
habeas and benedicas, haec dona, haec munera, haec sancta sacrificia illibata.
That God would accept and bless these Donations and Gifts, these holy
undefiled Sacrifices; that is, the Oblations of Bread and Wine, which are no
more than so, till the words of Consecration.

After this (as you heard) they pray, That this Oblation may be made to us, the
Body and Blood of thy dear Son Jesus Christ. Which do not imply a change of
Substances; for those words (fiat nobis) be made to us, may very well consist
with the Oblations remaining in Substance what they were before, only beging
the Communication of the Virtue and Efficacy of Christ's Passion to themselves.

And that this is the sense of the Canon, appears by those words after
Consecration, when they say, We offer to thy Majesty a pure Sacrifice of thy
Donations and Gifts. Which words plainly suppose, that they are in Nature what
they were, God's Creatures still, not the appearance and shadow of them only.
But they call them now the Bread of Eternal Life, and the Cup of Salvation;
because, after they are blessed and made Sacraments, they are not now to be
looked upon as bodily Food, but as the Food of our Souls, as representing that
Body of Christ, and his Passion, which is the Bread of Etern^^ Life.

If they had understood nothing to remain now after consecration, but Christ's
Natural Body, they would not have called this thy Gifts in the Plural Number,
but expressed it in the Singular, thy Gift. Neither can they refer to the
remaining Accidents, because they are no real Things, and rather tell us what
God has taken away, (the whole Substance of them) than what he has given.

But then what follows, puts it out of all doubt Supra quae propitio ac sereno
vultu respicere digneris.
; Upon which (still in the Plural) look propitiously. If it had been, Look upon
us propitiously for the sake of Christ, it had been well enough. Or, to desire
of God to look upon these things propitiously which they offer; if they mean
(as he that made the Prayer did) that God would accept this Oblation of Bread
and Wine, as he did of Abel and Melchisedeck, (which latter was indeed Bread
and Wine) this had been very proper. But to make that which we offer to be
Christ himself, (as they that believe Transubstantiation must expound it) and
to desire God to look propitiously and benignly upon him, when there can be no
fear that he should ever be unacceptable to his Father, nor none can be so
foolish as to think that Christ stands in need of our recommendation to God for
acceptance, this sense can never be agreeable to the Prayer. Therefore the most
Ancient of all the spurious Liturgies, I mean, that attributed to Clemens in
his Constitutions Lib. 8. c. 12. (...) -- (...) etc.
, has given us the true sense of it; We offer to thee this Bread and this Cup
-- and we beseech thee to look favorably upon these Gifts set before thee, O
God, who stand in need of nothing; and be well pleased with them for the
honor of thy Christ, etc.

Would it not run finely, to pray that God would be well pleased with Christ,
for the honor of his Christ?

But besides the Petition, that God would look propitiously upon them, it
follows in the Canon, That God would accept them, as he did the Gifts of Abel,
and Abraham, and Melchisedeck. How unagreeable is this (if Christ himself be
understood here) to make the Comparison for acceptance, betwixt a Lamb and a
Calf, or Bread and Wine, and Christ the Son of God, with whom he was always
highly pleased.

But then what follows still entangles Matters more in the Church of Rome's
Sense. The Prayer, That God would command these things to be carried by the
hands of his Holy Angel to the High Altar above. For how can the Body of Christ
be carried by Angels to Heaven, which never left it since his Ascension, but is
always there? Besides the High Altar above, in the Sense of the Ancients, is
Christ himself. And Remigius of Auxerre tells us De celebrat. Missae in Bibl.
Pat. 2dae Edit. Tom. 6. p. 1164.

In Coelo rapitur ministerio Angelorum consociandum corpori Christi.


, That S. Gregory's Opinion of the Sacrament was, That it was snatched into
Heaven by Angels, to be joined to the Body of Christ there. But then in the
sense of Transubstantiation, what absurd stuff is here to pray, that Christ's
Body may be joined to his own Body? So that there can be no sense in the
Prayer, but ours, to understand it of the Elements offered devoutly, first at
this Altar below, which by being blessed become Christ's Representative Body,
and obtain acceptance above through his Intercession there And thus it is fully
explained, by the Author of the Constitutions Lib. 8. c. 13. in initio. (...).
; Let us entreat God, through his Christ, for the Gift offered to the Lord God,
that the good God, by the mediation of his Christ, would receive it to his
Celestial Altar, for a sweet smelling Savor.

To put the Matter further out of all doubt, it is observable, that the
Liturgies that go under the name of S. James, and S. Mark, do both of them
mention the acceptance of the Gifts of Abel and Abraham, and the admitting them
to the Celestial Altar, before the reciting the words of the Institution, or
Consecration, (as the Roman Church calls them, by which they say the Change is
made). That the Liturgy of S. Chrysostom prays, That God would receive the
Oblations proposed to his Supercelestial Altar, almost in the same words, both
before and after Consecration; and that he looked upon them to be the same in
substance that they were before, plainly appears by an expression after all,
where he prays (...).
, That the Lord would make an equal division of the proposed Gifts to every one
for good, according to every Man's particular need. Which cannot be understood
of Christ's proper Body, (but of the consecrated Bread and Wine) which cannot
admit of shares or Portions, equal or unequal.

Lastly, That S. Basil's Liturgy also, before the Consecration, prays, That the
Oblations may be carried unto the supercelestial Altar, and be accepted as the
Gifts of Abel, Noah, Abraham, etc. And to show that even after the words of
Institution, he did not believe them to be other things than they were before,
he still calls them the Antitypes (...), etc.
of the Body and Blood of Christ; and prays, That the Spirit may come upon us
and upon the Gifts proposed, to bless and sanctify them, and to make this Bread
the venerable Body of our Lord God and Savior Jesus Christ, and this Cup his
Blood, the Spirit working the change.

And afterward the Priest prays (...).
, That by reason of his Sins, he would not divert the Grace of his Holy Spirit
from the proposed Gifts. A needless fear, if the Gifts were already Christ's
Body, that the Spirit should be hindered from coming upon that, where all the
Fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, by any Man's Sins.

The next Passage of the Canon increases still the difficulty to them that
believe Transubstantiation. When it says, Through Jesus Christ our Lord, by
whom, O Lord, thou do always create, sanctify, quicken, bless and bestow all
these good things on us. If there be no good thing remaining in the Eucharist
besides Christ, when these words are said, What Sense or Truth is there in
them? Can Christ, or his Body that already exists, be created anew, and be
always created? Can that be always sanctified, that was never common? Or, is he
to be raised and quickened anew daily, that once being so raised, can die no
more? etc. But that which makes the Absurdity of this Interpretation the
greater, is, that they say that all this is done to Christ by Christ himself;
as if God by Christ did create Christ; and by Christ, did bless, and quicken,
and sanctify Christ; which none but he that is forsaken of common Sense can
affirm.

The old Interpreters of the Canon made other work of it, and supposed that the
Creatures offered to God, remained Creatures still; for thus the forecited
Remigius In Bibl. Patr. Tom. 6. p. 1165. Per Christum Deus Pater haec omnia non
solum in exordio creavit condendo, sed etiam semper creat praeparando and
reparando: bona, quia omnia a Deo creata valde bona: creata and suis
conspectibus oblata sanctificat, ut quae erant simplex creatura, fiant
Sacramenta: vivificat, ut sint mysteria vitae: Benedicit, quia omni
benedictione coelesti and gratia accumulat. Praestat nobis, per eundem secum
sanctificantem, qui de corpore suo and sanguine suo nobis tam salubrem dedit
refectionem.
comments upon them. God the Father not only in the beginning, created all
these things by Christ, but also always creates them, by preparing and
repairing them. Good, because all things created by Good are very good. He
sanctifies those things so created and offered in his sight, when the things
that were a simple Creature, are made Sacraments: he quickens them, so that
they become Mysteries of Life: He blesses them, because he heaps all Celestial
Benediction and Grace on them. He bestows them on us, by the same Christ
sanctifying them with him, who has given to us so wholesome a repast from his
Body and Blood.

What can be also more plain than the words of the next Prayer I mentioned,
That what we have taken with our Mouth, may of a Temporal Gift be made an
Eternal Remedy? Did ever any one call Christ a Temporal Gift, in distinction
from an Eternal Remedy? Is it not certain that the Oblata, the things offered,
are the Temporal Gift, which by our due receiving them, become eternally
beneficial to us?

The last Prayer also, which begs, That the Body and Blood of Christ may cleave
to their Bowels or Entrals, cannot be interpreted of his proper and natural
Body; since, as the Romanists confess, this Body can neither touch us, nor be
touched by us, as it exists in the Sacrament, much less can cleave or stick to
our Bodies. But the representative Body of Christ may; and he that made this
Petition first, seems to tell us his own Sense, (though no very wise one) that he
would not have this Holy Food to pass through him, as other Meats did (and
which many of the Ancients thought this also did) but might remain and be
consumed (as S. Chrysostom's phrase is) with the Substance of his Body.

Thus I think I have demonstrated sufficiently the first thing I asserted at
the beginning of this Chapter, That the old Prayers in the Canon of the Mass,
concerning the Sacrament, agree not with the present Faith of the Roman Church.

I proceed now to show the other thing, That their New Prayers and Devotions to
the Sacrament, have no countenance from the Ancient Church.

I told the Reader before of their New Festival, which the Missal calls the
Feast and Solemnity of the Body of Christ. They have suited all things
answerably to it; New Prayers, New Hymns; and their allowed Books of Devotion,
have an Office of the Blessed Sacrament, for one day of the Week, and a New
Litany, etc. Which I shall give now some account of, and though all of them are
not direct Prayers to it, yet they are such strains concerning it, and in such
a new Style, as has no old Example. Missal, Romans in Solemn. corporis Christi.

Oration.

Deus qui nobis sub Sacramento mirabili passionis tuae memoriamreliquisti:
tribue, quaesumus, ita nos corporis and sanguinis tui sacra Mysteria venerari,
ut redemptionis tuae fructum in nobis jugiter sentiamus. Qui vivis, etc.




Thus translated in the Manual of Godly Prayers.

O God, which under the Admirable Sacrament, have left unto us the Memory of
thy Passion: grant, we beseech thee, that we may so worship the Sacred
Mysteries of thy Body and Blood, that continually we may feel in us the fruit
of thy Redemption.

Who live, etc.

I believe the Ancient Church never thus prayed, that by the worship of the
Sacred Mysteries, they might feel the Fruit of Christ's Redemption; but that
they might so receive the Sacred Mysteries, etc. for they laid the stress upon
worthy receiving, as this Church does upon worshipping.

In an Office of the Venerable Sacrament, printed at Colen, 1591. they are
still more particular.
Ibid. p. 72. ad completor. Deus qui gloriosum corporis and sanguinis tui
mysterium nobiscum manner voluisti: praesta, quaesumus, ita nos corporalem
praesentiam tuam venerari in terris, ut ejus visione gaudere mereamur in coelis.

Ibid. p. 44. ad primam. Deus qui in passionis tuae memoriam panem and vinum in
corpus and sanguinem tuum mirabiliter transmurasti; concede propitius, ut qui
in venerabili Sacramento tuam praesentiam corporalem credimus, ad contemplandam
speciem tuae celsitudinis perducamur. Qui vivis, etc.

O God, who would have the glorious Mystery of thy Body and Blood to remain
with us; grant, we pray thee, that we may so worship thy corporal Presence on
Earth, that we may be worthy to enjoy the Vision of it in Heaven. Who live,
etc.

Qui vivis, etc.

Again thus;

O God, who in memory of thy Passion did wonderfully change Bread and Wine
into thy Body and Blood; mercifully grant, that we who believe thy Corporal
Presence in the Venerable Sacrament, may be brought to the beholding of the
appearance of thy Highness.

Who live, etc.

Whatsoever the Son of God said, I believe.
Nothing is truer than this Word of Truth.
The Deity only on the Cross was hid,
Here the Humanity also is concealed:
But both believing and confess^ng both,
I ask what the Repenting Thief desired.
I do not see, as Thomas did, thy Wounds,
Yet I acknowledge thee to be my God.
O make me still more to believe in thee,
On thee to place my Hope, and thee to love.
O thou Memorial of my dying Lord,

Grant that my Soul on thee may ever live,
And thou to it may always sweetly taste, etc.

Nulla rei fit scissura,

Being taught by holy Lessons, we consecrate
Bread and Wine for a saving Host.
It Is a Maxim to Christians, that Bread is
changed into Flesh, and Wine into Blood.
What thou do not comprehend, or see, a
strong Faith confirms it, besides the order
of Nature.
Precious Things lie hid under different Species,
which are Signs only, not Things.
The Flesh is Meat, and the Blood Drink, yet
Christ remains whole under each Kind.
Uncut, unbroken, undivided, he is received
whole by him that takes him.
When a thousand take him, one takes as
much as they; nor is he consumed in
taking.
The Good and Bad both take him, but their
Lot is unequal in Life and Death.
He is Death to the Bad, and Life to the Good;
behold an unlike end of a like taking.
When the Sacrament is broken,
Be not staggered, but remember,
There is as much in a Particle
As the whole covers.
Here is no division of the thing,
Only a breaking of the Sign;
Whereby neither the State nor Stature of
the thing signified is diminished, etc.

Thus translated in the Manual of Godly Prayers.

At his last Supper made by Night,
He with his Brethren takes his Seat,
And having kept the Ancient rite
Using the Laws prescribed Meat;
His twelve Disciples does invite,
From his own Hands himself to eat.
The Word made Flesh, to words imparts
Such strength, that Bread his Flesh is made,
He Wine into his Blood converts;
And if our Sense here fail and fade,
To satisfy Religious Hearts,
Faith only can the Truth persuade.
Then to this Sacrament so high,
Low reverence let us now direct,
Old Rites must yield in dignity
To this, with such great Graces decked:
And Faith will all those Wants supply,
Wherein the Senses feel defect, etc.
In another Hymn of Th. Aquinas, which begins, Verbum supernum prodiens, they
pray thus to the Sacrament.

O salutaris Hostia,

Bella premunt hostilia,
Da robur, fer auxilium.
O saving Host, that openest Heaven's Door,
The Arms of our Foes, do us enclose:
Thy strength we need; O help with speed,
We humbly thee implore.
There was published at Paris, with the app^obration of three Doctors of the
Faculty there, An. 1669. a little Book in French, called, Practique pour Adorer
le tres Saint Sacrament de l' Autel: Or, A Form for the Adoration of the most
Holy Sacrament of the Altar. Which begins thus: Praised and adored be the most
Holy Sacrament of the Altar.

And then adds;

Whosoever shall say these Holy Words, [Praised be the most Holy Sacrament of
the Altar] shall gain an hundred days of Indulgences; and he that does
reverence, hearing them repeated, as much. He that, being confessed and
communicated, shall say the abovesaid words, shall gain a Plenary Indulgence;
and the first five times that he shall say them, after his having been
Confessed and Communicated, he shall deliver five of his Friends-souls, whom he
pleases, out of Purgatory.

Then follows the Form for honoring the Holy Sacrament, consisting of two
Prayers, as follows, (which I shall set down in Latin and English, because I
find them in the Hours of Sarum, Fol. 66. and in the S. Litaniae variae, p. 44.
printed at Colen, 1643. The first of them has this Rubric before it in the
Hours of Salisbury. Our Holy Father the Pope, John xxii. has granted to all
them that devoutly say this Prayer after the Elevation of our Lord Jesu Christ,
three thousand days of Pardon for deadly Sins).

Anima Christi sanctifica me.
Corpus Christi salva me.
Sanguis Christi inebria me.
Aqua lateris Christi lava me.
(Hor. Sar. Splendour vultus Christi illumina me.)
Passio Christi conforta me.
(H. Sar. Sudor vultus Christi virtuosissime sana me.)
O bone Jesu exaudi me.
Intra vulnera tua absconde me.
Ne permittas me separari a ce.
Ab host maligno defend me.
In hora mortis meae voca me,
Et jube me venire ad te;
Ut cum sanctis tuis laudem te
In saecula soeculorum. Amen.
Soul of Christ, sanctify me.
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water of Christ's Side, wash me.
Passion of Christ, comfort me.
O good Jesus hear me.
Within thy Wounds hide me.
Suffer me not to be separated from thee.
From the malicious Enemy defend me.
In the Hour of my Death call me,
And command me to come to thee,
That with thy Saints I may praise thee,
For evermore. Amen.

After this, the French Form adds what follows.

These two good Prayers were found in the Sepulcher of our Lord Jesus Christ in
Jerusalem; and whosoever carries them about him with Devotion, and in Honor of
our Lord Jesus Christ, shall be delivered from the Devil, and from sudden
Death, and shall not die of an ill Death. He shall be preserved from
Pestilence, and all infectious Diseases. No Sorcerer, nor Sorcery, shall be
able to hurt him or her, that has these two good Prayers about them. The Fire
from Heaven shall not fall upon the House where these Prayers are rehearsed
with devotion. A Woman with Child, saying them devoutly, shall be brought to
Bed, without any danger of her own, or her Child's Death. Lightnings and
Thunders shall not fall upon the Houses where these Prayers are rehearsed with
Devotion. Such a one shall not die without Confession, and God will give him
Grace to repent of his Sins. Now I will add a Specimen of Litanies of the
Sacrament.

This is enough to show into what strains of Devotion the present Roman Church
now runs, since Transubstantiation is an Article of its Faith. I deny not that
these Prayers are very natural if that Doctrine were true; and I would fain
have a good Reason assigned, why, if this Doctrine was believed of old, this
was not the way of the Primitive Devotion: If they affirm that it was, it lies
upon them to produce the evidence. But then let me tell them beforehand, that
we will not be shamm'd off with a Rhetorical Prosopopoeia of an Author, under
the name of S. Denis the Areopagite (which has been the only thing I have seen
alleged, and as often answered) whose Authority neither cannot be considerable
to us, who remember that he was first produced and shown to the World by
Heretics, and rejected by the Orthodox.

CHAP. XVI. The Sixteenth Difference. Our Ancient Roman-Saxon Church differred
from the present Roman Church, in the Article of Transubstantiation and
Corporal Presence.
THis is the Last Difference I shall mention, though not the least; but a very
material consirmation of what I have been all along proving, That there is no
consen^ ^f the Ancient Church with the present Roman Church, in their Faith and
Opinions about the Eucharist; when we shall find, that even our own Old English
Church, that had received most of its Instructions in Christianity from the
Roman, and in many other things agreed with what it now professes, yet in this
widely differed from it.

This plainly argues one of these two things, either that the then Roman
Church, had not the Opinions of the present Church in these Matters and so did
not propagate them to us; (which cannot be said, when we remember the busy
Disputes about these Matters in the 9th Century, though they were not yet come to
a determination); or else, that when the Roman Church warped, and generally
espoused a New Doctrine which the Ancient Fathers were strangers to, we still
kept our Ground, and did not suffer our selves to be perverted, but held to the
Ancient Belief.

This is the Truth of our Case, as appears by a noble Remain of an Easter
Sermon (about 700 Years old) in the Saxon Tongue, among other Catholic
Homilies that were to be read yearly in the Church, It was produced in the last
Age in the Saxon with a Translation in our English Tongue; (printed by John
Day) it was fince put, with the same Translation, by Mr. Fox into his
Martyrology Vol. 2. p. 380. last Edition.
, and has been set forth with a Latin Translation by the Learned Abr. Whelock,
in his Saxon Edition of Bede's Ecclesiastical History, p. 462. printed at
Cambridg 1644. out of which I shall transcribe as much as will serve to prove
our Assertion, softning the harshness of the Phrases of the last Age, and
expressing the sense in words more easily understood.

The Easter Sermon begins thus:

MEN Beloved, you have been often discoursed to, concerning our Savior's
Resurrection, how he, after his Passion on this Day, rose powerfully from the
Dead. Now we shall, by God's Grace explain something to you about the Holy
Eucharist, which this day we are bound to frequent, and instruct your
understanding about this Mystery, both according to the Old and New Testament,
that no doubting may disturb you concerning this Life-giving Banquet. -- The
Sermon goes on with an account of the Jewish Passover, and the Application of
those things to the Eucharist, which I omit;

-- Christ, before his suffering, consecrated Bread, P. 469.
and distributed it to his Disciples, saying thus, Eat this Bread, it is my
Body, and do this in remembrance of me: Also he Consecrated Wine in a Cup, and
said, Drink ye all of this, This is my Blood which is shed for many for the
Remission of Sins. The Apostles did, as Christ commanded, they consecrated
Bread and Wine for the Eucharist. And to his memory also afterward every one of
their Successors, and all Christ's Priests, According to Christ's Command, by
the Apostolical Benediction, did consecrate Bread and Wine in his Name. Now Men
have often disputed, P. 470.
and do it still, How that Bread which is prepared of Corn, and is baked by the
heat of Fire, can be changed into Christ's Body; and how that Wine which is
pressed out of many Grapes, by any blessing of it, can be changed into our
Lord's Blood? Now to such Men, I answer, that some things are spoken of Christ
by signification, some others by a known thing: It is a true thing, and known,
that Christ was born of a Virgin, and voluntarily suffered Death, and was
buried, and this Day rose from the Dead. He is called Bread, and a Lamb, and a
Lion, and otherwise, by signification. He is called Bread, because he is our
Life, and the Life of Angels. He is called a Lamb, for his Innocence. A Lion,
for his Strength, whereby he overcame the strong Devil. Yet notwithstanding,
according to true Nature, Christ is neither Bread, nor a Lamb, nor a Lion.
Wherefore then is that Holy Eucharist called Christ's Body, or his Blood, if it
be not truly what it is called? Truly the Bread and Wine, which are consecrated
by the Mass of the Priests, show one thing outwardly to Men's Senses, and
another thing they declare inwardly to believing Minds. Outwardly, Bread and
Wine are seen both in appearance, and in taste; yet they are truly after
Consecration Christ's Body and Blood, by a Spiritual Sacrament. An Heathen
Child is Baptized, yet he alters not his outward shape, though he be changed
within. He is brought to the Font full of Sin through Adam's Disobedience, but
he is washed from all his Sins inwardly, though he has not changed his outward
Shape. So also that Holy Font-Water, which is called the Wellspring of Life,
is like in Nature (in specie) to other Waters, and is subject to corruption;
but the Power of the Holy Ghost, by the Priest's Blessing, comes upon that
corruptible Water; and after that, it can wash both Body and Soul from all
Sins, P. 471.
by spiritual Power. We see now in this one Creature two things: that, whereby,
according to true Nature, it is corruptible Water, and that whereby, according
to the Spiritual Mystery, it has a saving Power. So also, if we look upon that
Holy Eucharist according to a corporeal Sense, then we see that it is a
Creature corruptible and changeable; but if we own a spiritual Power there,
then we understand that Life is in it, and that it confers Immortality on those
that taste it by Faith. There is a great difference betwixt the insible Virtue
(and Power) of this Holy Eucharist, and the visible appearance of its proper
Nature. By its Nature it is corruptible Bread, and corruptible Wine; and by the
Virtue of the Divine Word, it is truly the Body and Blood of Christ; yet not
corporally so, but spiritually. There is much differencce betwixt that Body
which Christ suffered in, and that Body which is consecrated for the Eucharist.
The Body that Chrivt suffered in, was Born of the Flesh of Mary, with Blood and
Bones, with Skin and Nerves; animated by a rational Spirit in humane Members:
but his Spiritual Body, which we call the Eucharist, is collected from many
grains of Corn, without Blood and Bone, without Member or Soul: wherefore there
is nothing in it to be understood Corporeally, but all is to be understood
Spiritually. Whatsoever is in that Eucharist which restores Life to us, this is
from Spiritual Virtue, and from Invisible Operation. Therefore that Holy
Eucharist is called a Sacrament, because one thing is there seen, and another
thing understood: that which is there seen has a bodily Nature, that which we
understand in it has a spiritual Virtue. The Body of Christ, that suffered
Death, P. 472.
and rose from the Dead, henceforth dies no more, but is eternal and
impassible. That Eucharist is Temporary, not Eternal; it is corruptible, and
capable of division into minute Parts; it is chewed with the Teeth, and sent
into the draught: yet it will be true, that according to spiritual Virtue, it
is whole in every part: Many receive that Holy Body, yet according to the
spiritual Mystery, it will be whole in every part. Though some receive a lesser
part of it, yet there will not be more virtue in the greater part than in the
lesser, because it will be whole in all Men according to the invisible virtue.
This Sacrament is a Pledge, and a Type; the Body of Christ is the Truth: We keep
this Pledge Sacramentally, till we come to the Truth it self; and then is the
Pledge at an end. It is indeed, as we said before, Christ's Body and his Blood,
but not Corporally, but Spiritually. Do not dispute, how this can be effected,
but believe it firmly, that so it is. Here follow some idle Visions, which that
credulous Age were fond of, but are nothing to the purpose, and therefore I
omit them.

-- Paul the Apostle speaks of the old Israelites writing thus in his Epistle
to the Faithful. P. 473.
All our Forefathers were baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea; and all ate
the same spiritual Meat, and all drank the same spiritual Drink, for they drank
of that spiritual Rock, and that Rock was Christ. That Rock, from whence the
Water then flowed, was not Christ in a Corporal Sense, but it signified Christ,
who declared thus to the Faithful, Whosoever thirsts, let him come to me and
drink, and from his belly shall flow living Water. This he said of the Holy
Ghost, which they that Believed on him, should receive. The Apostle Paul said,
that the People of Israel ate the same spiritual Meat, and drank the same
Spiritual Drink, because the heavenly Food that fed them for forty Years, and
that Water that flowed from the Rock, signified Christ's Body and Blood, which
are now daily offered in the Church of God. It was the same which we offer to
day, not corporally, but spiritually. We told you before, that Christ
consecrated Bread and Wine for the Eucharist before his Passion, and said, This
is my Body, and my Blood: he had not yet suffered, and yet he changed, by his
invisible Power, that Bread into his Body, and that Wine into his Blood; as he
did before in the Wilderness, before he was born Man, when he turned the
heavenly Food into his Flesh, and that Water flowing from the Rock into his
Blood. P. 474.
Many Persons ate of the Heavenly Food in the Desert, and drank of the
Spiritual Drink, and yet, as Christ said, are dead. Christ meant not that Death
which no Man can avoid, but he understood eternal Death, which several of that
People, for their Unbelief, had deserved. Moses and Aaron, and several others
of the People that pleased God, ate that heavenly Bread, and did not die that
everlasting Death, though they died the common Death. They saw that the heavenly
Food was visible and Corruptible; but they understood that visible thing
spiritually, and they tasted it spiritually. Jesus said, Whosoever eats my Flesh,
and drinks my Blood, has Eternal Life: He did not command them to eat that
Body which he had assumed, nor to drink that Blood which he shed for us; but by
that Speech, he meant the Holy Eucharist, which is Spiritually his Body, and
his Blood; and whosoever tastes this, with a believing Heart, shall have that
Eternal Life. Under the old Law, the Faithful offered diverse Sacrifices to God,
which had a future signification of the Body of Christ, which he has offered
in Sacrifice to his heavenly Father for our Sins. This Eucharist which is now
consecrated at God's Altar, is a Commemoration of the Body of Christ which he
offered for us, and of his Blood which he shed for us: As he himself commanded,
Do this in remembrance of me. Christ once suffered by himself; but yet his
Passion by the Sacrament of this Holy Eucharist, is daily renewed at the Holy
Mass. Wherefore the Holy Mass is profitable very much both for the Living, and
also for the Dead, as it has been often declared, etc.

The rest of the Sermon being of a moral and allegorical Nature, I omit.

Besides this Sermon in Public, we have also two other Remains of Elfrike the
Abbot in the Saxon Tongue Published at the end of the foresaid Sermon, printed
by John Day. Also in the Notes on Bid 's Eccl. Hist. p. 332, 333, 334.
, which speak the very same Sense, and deserve to be inserted as far as they
concern this Argument of the Eucharist, and the change made in it.

The first is an Epistle to Wulffine Bishop of Shyrburn, in which is this
Passage.

-- The Eucharist is not the Body of Christ corporally, but spiritually: not
the Body in which he suffered, but that Body when he consecrated Bread and Wine
for the Eucharist, the night before his Passion, and said of the Bread he
Blessed, This is my Body; and again of the Wine he blessed, This is my Blood,
which is shed for many for the Remission of Sins. Now then understand, that the
Lord, who was able to change that Bread before his Passion into his Body, and
that Wine into his Blood, Spiritually; that the same (Lord) by the Hands of the
Priests, daily consecrates Bread and Wine for his Spiritual Body, and for his
Spiritual Blood. The second, an Epistle of Elfricke to Wulfstane Archbishop of
York, in which, among other things (against too long reserving the Eucharist,)
he says thus:

Christ himself consecrated the Eucharist before his Passion; Vid. p. 334.
Hist. Eccles. Sax. Lat. Bedae.
he blessed Bread, and brake it, saying thus to his Apostles, Eat this Bread,
it is my Body: and again he blessed the Cup, filled with Wine, and spoke thus
to them, Drink ye all of this, it is my Blood of the New Testament, which is
shed for many for the Remission of Sins. Our Lord, who consecrated the
Eucharist before his Passion, and said; that Bread was his Body, and Wine truly
his Blood, he also daily consecrates, by the Priests hands, Bread for his Body,
and Wine for his Blood, in a Spiritual Mystery, as we read in Books. [Yet
notwithstanding that Lively Bread is not the same Body in which Christ
suffered, nor that Holy Wine the Blood of our Savior (which was shed for us)
in bodily thing (or sense, in re corporali) but in a Spiritual sense (in
ratione Spirituali.) That Bread indeed was his Body, and also that Wine his
Blood, just as that heavenly Bread which we call Manna (which fed God's People
forty Years) viz. was his Body, and that clear. Water was his Blood that then
flowed from the Rock in the Wilderness.] As Paul writes in his Epistle, They
all ate the same spiritual Meat and drank the same spiritual Drink, etc. The
Apostle that says, what you have heard, They all ate etc. he does not say,
corporally, but spiritually. Christ was not as yet born, nor his Blood shed:
then it was the People of Israel did eat that Spiritual Meat, and drank of that
Rock; neither was that Rock Christ Corporeally though he spoke so. The Sacraments
of the Old Law were the same, and did spiritually signify that Sacrament (or
Eucharist) of our Savior's Body, which we now consecrate.

This Last Epistle Elfricke wrote first in the Latin Tongue to Wulfstane,
containing, though not word for word, yet the whole Sense of the English Epistle;
and that Paragraph of it which I have enclosed between two Brackets, was looked
upon as so disagreeable to the present Faith of the Roman Church, that some had
rased them out of the Worcester Book; but the same Latin Epistle being found in
Exceter Church, it was restored.

I was once about to have added some Citations here out of Bertram's Book, (de
corpore and sanguine Domini) out of which many passages in the Saxon Sermon
foregoing, were taken. But they are so many, that I must have transcribed, and
the Book it self is small, and so well worth the reading, especially with the
late Translation of it into English, and a Learned Historical Dissertation
before it, giving a large account of the Difference betwixt his Opinion, and
that of Transubstantiation (printed An 1686) that I shall rather refer the
Reader to it, where he may abundantly satisfy himself.

Instead of it, I will only add one Testimony more out of Rabanus Archbishop
of Mentz, in an Epistle to Heribaldus Epist. ad Herib. c. 33. de Eucharist.
. Which we are beholden to the Learned Baluzius for giving it us entire, (in
Appendice ad Reginonem, p. 516.) a Passage having been rased out of the
Manuscript, out of which it was first published. Thus he says;

As for the Question you put, Quod autem interrogastis, utrum Eucharistia
postquam consumitur and in secessum emittitur, more aliorum ciborum, iterum
redeat in naturam pristinam quam habuerat, antequam in Altari consecraretur,
superflua est hujusmodi Quaestio, cum ipse Salvator dixerit in Evangelio, Omne
quod intrat in os, in ventrem vadit, and in secessum emittitur. Sacramentum
Corporis and Sanguinis ex rebus visibilibus and corporalibus conficitur, sed
invisibilem tam corporis quam animae efficut sanctificationem, Quae est enim
ratio, ut hoc quod stomacho digeritur, and in secessum emittitur, iterum in
statum pristinum redeat, cum nullus hoc unquam fieri asscruerit? Nam quidam
nuper de ipso Sacramento corporis and sanguinis Domini non rite sentientes
dixerunt, hoc ipsum corpus and sanguinem Domini quod de Maria Virgin natum
est, and in quo ipse Dominus passus est in Cruce, and resurrexit de sepulchro,
[Idem. esse quod sumitur de altari] cui errori quantum potuimus, ad Egilonem
Abbatem scribent^s, de corpore ipso quid vere credendum sit, aperuimus.
Whether the Eucharist, after it is consumed and sent into the Draught as other
Meats are, does return again into its former Nature, which it had before it was
consecrated on the Altar; This Question is superfluous, when our Savior
himself has said in the Gospel, Every thing that enters into the Mouth, goes
into the Belly, and is cast out into the Draught. The Sacrament of the Body and
Blood, is made up of things Visible and Corporeal, but effects the Invisible
Sanctification both of Body and Soul. And what reason is there, that what is
digested in the Stomach, and sent into the Draught, should return into its
pristine State, seeing none has ever asserted that this was done? Some indeed
of late, not thinking rightly of the Sacrament of our Lord's Body and Blood
have said (which are the very words of Paschasius, whom he opposes) that the
very Body and Blood of our Lord, which was born of the Virgin Mary, and in
which our Lord suffered on the Cross, and rose again out of the Grave, [is the
same that is taken from the Altar]; which Error we having opposed as we were
able, writing to the Abbot Egilo, and declared what ought truly to be believed
concerning the Body it self.

That which he calls here an Error, is an Article now of the Romish Faith,
which some Zealous Monk meeting withal, and not enduring it should be condemned
as an Error, that the same Body which was born of the Virgin, etc. is the same
that we receive at the Altar, scraped out those words which I have enclosed
between the Brackets; and we may securely trust our Adversaries in this Matter,
who have skill enough to know what Assertions make for them, and what against
them.

CHAP. XVII. The CONCLUSION. That the Doctrine of Transubstantiation has given
a new occasion to the Enemies of Christian Religion to blaspheme. It is so
great a stumbling block to the Jews, that their Conversion is hopeless, whilst
this is believed by them to be the Common Faith of Christians. That though the
Church of Rome will not hearken to us, yet they may be provoked to emulation by
the Jews themselves, who have given a better account of Christ's Words of
Institution, and more agreeable to the Fathers, than this Church has; and
raised unanswerable Objections against its Doctrine.
HAving considered, in the foregoing Chapters, the Sense of the Ancient Church
about Matters relating to the Eucharist, and Transubstantiation, from their own
Writings; and found that their Assertions are inconsistent with the Belief of
the present Roman Church; and that their Practices are not to be reconciled
thereunto. Having also made an Enquiry into the Ancient forms of Devotion,
relating to the Eucharist, remaining still in this Church, and found them to
speak a Language, which has a Sense agreeing indeed with that of the Ancients,
but no Sense at all, when the Doctrine of Transubstantiation is supposed, and
those Prayers to be interpreted by it, etc.

I shall now, for a Conclusion, take a view also of the principal Enemies of
the Christian Faith; which will afford a convincing Evidence, that the Roman
Doctrine is Novel, and a stranger to the Ancient Christians.

It is sufficiently known, that the Adversaries of Christianity took all the
occasions possible, and whatsoever gave them any color to reproach the Faith
and Worship of Christians, and to make their Names odious. Nothing that looked
strange and absurd in either, escaped, being taken notice of by such as Celsus
and Porphyry, Lucian and Julian, among the Heathens, and such as Trypho among
the Jews. They curiously examined and surveyed what they taught and practiced,
and whatsoever they thought to be foolish and incredible, they, with all their
wit and cunning, endeavored to expose it. So, they did with the Doctrines of
the Trinity, the Eternal Generation of the Son of God, his Incarnation, his
Crucifixion especially, and our Resurrection. Neither were they less praying
into the Christian Mysteries and Worship, which they could not be ignorant of,
there being so many Deserters and Apostates in those Times of Persecution, who
were well acquainted with them; and by threatenings and fear of torment if there
were any thing secret were likely to betray them. Not to insist upon this, that
the great Traducer of Christians, I mean Julian, was himself once initiated in
their Mysteries, and so could not be Ignorant of what any of them were; and has
in particular laughed at their Baptism, that Christians should fansy a purgation
thereby from Great Crimes.

Yet, after all this, they took no occasion from the Eucharist to traduce them;
tho, if Christians then had given that adoration to it, that is now paid in the
Roman Church, and if they had declared, either for a Corporal Presence, or an
oral Manducation of him that was their God, they had the fruitfullest Subject
in the World given them, both to turn off all the Objections of the Christians
against themselves, for worshipping senseless and inanimate things; and also to
lay the most plausible Charge of folly and madness against them, which their
great Orator Cicero, l. 3. de Not. Deorum. Ecquem tam amentem esse putas, qui
illud quo vescatur, Deum credat esse?
had pronounced, before Christianity was a Religion in the World. Can any Man
be supposed so mad, to believe that to be a God which he eats?

A Learned Romanist Rigaltius notis ad Tertal. lib. 2. c. 5. ad Vxorem. Se id
facere in Eucharisticis suis testarentur.
affirms, of the Ancient Christians, That they did testify their eating the
Flesh, and drinking the Blood of their Lord God in their Discourses of the
Eucharist. Which is true indeed, taking this eating and drinking in the
Sacramental Sense we do; and so their Adversaries must needs understand their
meaning. Otherwise (without a Miracle to hinder it) what he acknowledges in the
same place, could never be true, Ibid. Observandum vero, inter tot probra and
convitia accusantium Christianos impietatis, eo quod neque aras haberent neque
sacrificarent, interque tot fratrum perfidorum transfugia, non extitisse qui
Christianos criminarentur, quod Dei ac Domini sui carnes ederent, sanguinem
potarent.
That among so many Reproaches of those that accused Christians of Impiety, for
not having Altars nor Sacrifices, and among so many false Brethren that were
Turn-coats, yet there were none that made this an Accusation against them, that
they are the Flesh of their God and Lord, and drank his Blood.

We have this ingenuous confession of Bellarmine himself De Eucharist. l. 2. c.
12. Vere stulti haberi possemus, si absque Verbo Dei crederemus veram Christi
carnem ore corporali manducari.
, That we might be accounted truly Fools, if without the Word of God, we
believed the true Flesh of Christ to be eaten with the Mouth of our Bodies. But
whether with or without the Word of God they believed such a corporal eating of
Christ's Flesh, had been all one to the Heathens, if they knew that this was
their Belief, and it would rather have strengthened their Reproach, if they knew
that they were bound thus to believe. But then what he adds is very remarkable,
Nam id semper infideles stultissimum paradoxum aestimarunt, ut notum est de
Averroe and aliis.
That Insidels always counted this a most foolish Paradox, as appears from
Averroes and others. I believe indeed, that they must always count this a
foolish Paradox, which Averroes charged Christians withal, in that known Saying
of his Se Sectam Christiana deteriorem aut ineptiorem nullam reperire, quam qui
sequuntur, ii quem colunt Deum dentibus ipsi suis discerpunt ac devorant.
. That he found no Sect worse, or more foolish, than the Christians, who tear
with their Teeth, and devour that God whom they worship. But why was not this
cast always in the Teeth of Christians, if this was always their professed
Doctrine? Was Celsus, or Julian, or Lucian, less sagacious, or less malicious
than Averroes, that not a word of this foolish Paradox was ever so much as
hinted by them to the reproach of Christians then?

But the Cardinal has instanced the most unluckily in the World, in naming only
Averroes for this Calumny, when all acknowledge that this Philosopher, and P.
Innocent 3. (who established Transubstantiation) lived in the same Age; and
some very learned Men prove, from the Arabian Accounts, that those two were
Contemporaries. And as for his [and aliis] others, I should be glad to see any
named, that urged what Averroes did to the Christians reproach, before the days
of Berengarius.

After that indeed, we can meet with a Follower of Mahomet; who (as a Learned
Man Hottinger in Eucharistia dejexja. Sect. 14. p. 220. Ahmed bin Edris ita
scribit, verba autem Isa (fic Arabes Christum vocant) super quo pax, Qui edit
carnem meam and bibit sanguinem, etc. Christiani literaliter intelligunt. Atque
sic Christiani atrociores sunt in Christum quam Judaei. Illi enim Christum
occisum reliquerunt; hi carnem ejus edunt and sangumem bibunt, quod ipso test
experientia, truculentius est.
gives us his words) says thus, Those words of Christ, He that eats my Flesh,
and drinks my Blood, he is in me, and I in him, etc. Christians understand
them literally, and so Christians are more cruel against Christ, than Jews; for
they left Christ when they had slain him, but these eat his Flesh, and drink
his Blood, which as experience testifies, is more savage.

After the Roman Church's declaring for Transubstantiation, (though not before)
we meet with the Oppositions of Jews, testifying their abhorrency Ibid. Joseph.
Albo de Ikkarim, lib. 3. cap. 25.

Nam panis est corpus Dei ipsorum. Aiunt enim corpus Jesu quod est in Coelis,
venire in Altar and vestiri pane and vino, post pronunciata verba, Hoc enim
est Corpus meum, a sacrificulo, qualiscunque ille demum fuerit, sive pius sive
impius, and omnia fieri Corpus unum cum corpore Messiae, etc.

-- Repugnant hic omnia Intelligibilibus primis, and ipsis etiam sensibus.


of a Doctrine, which talks of a Sacrifice, and makes Bread to be the Body of
their God, (which he means in the sense of Transubstantiation, by being turned
into it, and clothed with its Accidents) whose Body that is in Heaven, comes
upon the Altar; and upon the pronouncing these words, For this is my Body, by
the Priest, whether good or wicked is all one, all things are made one Body
with the Body of the Messiah, etc. -- Which things are all repugnant to the
first Principles of Reason, and to our very Senses themselves. As he afterward
shows in several Instances.

And now we are told, that it is a common Bye-word to reproach a Christian by
among the Turks, to call him Mange Dieu.

All these took their rise plainly from Transubstantiation, and not from the
Faith of the Ancient Church: For if one of it Theodoret. Interrog. 55. in Genes.

(...).


may speak for the rest, the Old Christians agreed in the Abhorrence, and
called it, the extremest stupidity to worship that which is eaten.

And again; Id. qu. 11. in Levit.

(...);




How can any one of a sound Mind, call that a God, which being offered to the
True God, is after wards eaten by him?

But now, after all, the saddest Consideration is, that the Prejudices are so
great against this, (and another Twin-Doctrine of the Roman Church, about the
worship of Images) that a perpetual Stumbling Block seems to be laid before the
Jews; and it may be looked upon as the (...), that which will always hinder and
obstruct their Conversion, whilst it is believed by them to be the common Sense
and Faith of Christians; and they have too great a Temptation to believe so,
when they have seen this Church, which has got the most worldly Power into its
hands, persecuting not only Jews, but Heretics (as they call all other
Christians that deny this Doctrine) to the Death for gainsaying it; and when
that Work will cease, God only knows. The Jews can never be supposed to get
over this hard Chapter, whilst they who call themselves the only Catholic
Christians, hold such things about the Body of Christ, (and remember that it is
about a Body) which as the forenamed Jos. Albo Ibid. Ista talia sunt quae men's
non potest concipere, neque os eloqui, neque auris audire.
speaks, No Man's Mind can conceive, nor Tongue utter, nor any Ear can hear. He
means, by reason of their absurdity.

So that the Case of the Jews, and their Conversion, seems to be hopeless and
desperate, according to all humane guesses, till there be a change wrought (not
in the substance of the Bread and Wine this Church dreams of, but) in the
Romanist's Belief. And though this also may seem, upon many accounts, to be as
hopeless as the former, yet, for a Conclusion, I will try, whether, as once the
Great Apostle thought it a wise method ( Romans 11.14.) by the Example of the
Gentiles, (...), to provoke the Jews to Emulation; so it may not be as proper,
to propose the Example of the Jews themselves to the Romanists, to provoke
their Emulation, whom they may see better explaining (as blind as they are)
Christ's words of Institution; and agreeing better with the Ancient Church in
the matter of the Eucharist, than themselves; and raising such Arguments and
Objections against the Transubstantiating Doctrine, as can never, to any
purpose, be answered.

The Instances of this are very remarkable, in a Book called Fortalitium Fidei
contra Judeos, etc. printed An. 1494. but written, as the Author himself tells
us ( fol. 61.) in the Year 1458. where he gives us the Arguments of a Jew
against Transubstantiation; some of which I shall out of him faithfully
translate.

The Jew Vid. l. 3. consid. 6. sol. 130 impossibl. 10.
begins with Christ's words of Institution, and shows, that they cannot be
interpreted otherwise than figuratively, and significatively, as the Fathers,
we have heard, have asserted.

1. Vos Christiani dicitis, etc. Ye Christians say in that Sacrament (of the
Eucharist) there is really the Body and Blood of Christ. This is impossible.
Because when your Christ, showing the Bread, said, This is my Body, he spoke
significatively, and not really; as if he had said, this is the Sign or Figure
of my Body. After which way of speaking, Paul said, 1 Cor. 10. The Rock was
Christ; that is, a Figure of Christ. And it appears evidently, that this was
the Intention of your Christ, because when he had discoursed about the eating
his Body, and drinking his Blood, to lay the offense that rose upon it among
the Disciples, he says, as it were, expounding himself, The words that I have
spoken to you are Spirit and Life: denoting, that what he had said, was to be
understood, not according to the Letter, but according to the Spiritual Sense.
And when Christ said, This is my Body, holding Bread in his Hands, he meant,
that that Bread was his Body (in potentia propinqua) in a near possibility,
viz. after he had eaten it, for then it would be turned into his. Body, or into
his Flesh; and so likewise the Wine. And after this manner we Jews do, on the
day of Unleavened Bread; for we take unleavened Bread in memory of that time,
when our Fathers were brought out of the Land of Egypt, and were not permitted
to stay so long there, as whilst the Bread might be leavened, that was the
Bread of the Passover; and we say; This is the Bread which our Fathers ate,
though that be not present, since it is past and gone; and so this unleavened
Bread, minds us of the Bread of Egypt, and this Bread is not that; so is that
Bread of which the Sacrifice of the Altar is made. It is sufficient for
Christians to say, that it is in memory of that Bread of Christ, though this
Bread be not that. And because it was impossible that one Bit of his Flesh
should be preserved in memory of him, he commanded, that that Bread should be
made, and that Wine, which was his Flesh and Blood in the next remove to come
into act; as we Jews do, (and Christ borrowed his Phrases and the Elements from
their Supper) at the Passover with the unleavened Bread, as we said before.
When therefore your Christ at the Table took Bread, and the Cup, and gave them
to his Disciples, he did not bid them believe that the Bread and Wine were
turned into his Body and Blood, but that as often as they did that, they should
do it in remembrance of him, viz. in memory of that past Bread: and if you
Christians did understand it so, no impossibility would follow; but to say the
contrary, as you assert, is to say an impossible thing, and against the
intention of your Christ, as we have showed.

This is what the Jew urges with great reason. But the Catholic Author makes a
poor Answer to it, and has nothing to say, in effect, but this, That the
Tradition of the Catholic Church concerning this Sacrament is true. viz. That
in this Sacrament there is really, and not by way of Signification, the True
Body and True Blood of Christ.

2. Whereas the Roman Church flies to Miracles in this case of
Transubstantiation, the Jew encounters that next of all, thus.

You Christians say that the Body and Blood of Christ is in the Sacrament of
the Altar by a Miracle; Ibid. 11. Impossib. p. 131.
this I prove to be impossible. Because if there were any Miracle in the case,
it would appear to the Eye; as when Moses turned the Rod into a Serpent; that
was performed evidently to the Eye, though Men knew not how it was done. So
also in the case of the Ark of the Covenant of Old, mighty Miracles were
wrought; and those not only sensible Miracles, but also public, and apparent
to all the People; (insomuch that Infidels were terrifyed at the very report of
such Miracles) Men seeing before their Eyes the Divine Power brightly shining
in Reverence of the Ark of his Covenant, as appears in his Dividing the Waters
of Jordan, while the People of Israel passed over dry-shod, the Waters on one
side swelling like a Mountain, and on the other flowing down as far as the dead
Sea, till the Priests with the Ark went over the Chanel of Jordan, and then
Jordan returned to its wonted course. But the Kings of the Amorites and
Canaanites hearing of so great and public a Miracle, were so confounded with
the terror of God, that no Spirit remained in them ( Josu. c. 4. and 5.) and so
I might instance in many other Evident Miracles, which to avoid tediousness, I
omit. And yet in that Ark, neither God nor Christ was really contained, but
only the Tables of Stone containing the Precepts of the Decalogue, and the Pot
of Manna, etc. ( Exodus 16.) and the Rod of Aaron that flourished in the House
of Levi ( Numb. 17.) If therefore by the Ark (that carried only the foresaid
Bodies that were inanimate, how sacred soever they were) God wrought in Honor
of it such evident far-spreading and public Miracles, how much more powerfully
should they have been wrought by him, if it were true, that in your Sacrament
of the Altar the true God or Christ were really contained, whom you affirm that
he ought to be worshipped and venerated infinitely above all. Since therefore
no such thing does appear there to the Eye, it follows that it is impossible
for any Miracle to be done there, since this is against the Nature of a
Miracle.

The answer to this is so weak, and so the rest, are generally such an
unintelligible School-jargon, that I shall not tire, the Reader with them. But
shall go on with the Jew.

3. Ibid. 12. Impossib. fol. 132.
You Christians do assert, that the true Body of Christ begins to be on the
Altar. This seems to be impossible; For a thing begins to be where it was not
before, two ways. Either by Local Motion, or by the conversion of another thing
into it; as appears in Fire, which begins to be any where, either because it is
kindled there anew, or is brought thither de novo.

But it is manifest, that the true Body of Christ was not always on the Altar;
because the Christians assert, that Christ ascended in his Body to Heaven. It
seems also impossible to be said, that any thing here is converted anew into
Christ's Body; because nothing seems convertible into that which existed
before; since that into which another thing is turned, by such a change, begins
to exist. Now it is manifest, that Christ's Body did praeexist, seeing it was
conceived in the Womb of Mary. It seems therefore impossible, that it should
begin to be on the Altar anew, by the Conversion of another thing into it.

In like manner, neither by a change of Place, because every thing that is
locally moved, does so begin to be in one place, that it ceases to be in that
other in which it was before. We must therefore say, that when Christ begins to
be on this Altar on which the Sacrament is performed, he ceases to be in Heaven
whither he ascended. It is also plain, that this Sacrament is in like manner
celebrated on diverse Altars. Therefore it is impossible that the Body of Christ
should begin to be there by a Local Motion.

4. You Christians affirm, Ibid. 13. Imposs. fol. 134.
that your Christ is whole in the Sacrament, under the Species of Bread and
Wine. This I prove thus to be impossible. Because never are the Parts of any
Body contained in diverse Places, the Body it self remaining whole. But now it
is manifest, that in this Sacrament the Bread and Wine are asunder in separate
Places. If therefore the Flesh of Christ be under the Species of Bread, and his
Blood under the Species of Wine, it seems to follow, that Christ does not
remain whole, but that always when this Sacrament is celebrated, his Blood is
separated from his Body.

5. Ibid. 14. Imposs. fol. eod.
You Christians say, that in that little Host, the Body of Christ is contained.
This I prove to be impossible. Because it is impossible that a greater Body
should be included in the place of a lesser Body. But it is manifest, that the
True Body of Christ is of a greater Quantity than the Bread that is offered on
the Altar. Therefore it seems impossible, that the true Body of Christ should
be whole and entire there, where the Bread seems to be. But if the whole be not
there, but only some part of it, then the foresaid Inconvenience returns, that
always when this Sacrament is performed, the Body of Christ is Differenced (or
separated) by Parts.

I will only here set down what the Catholic Author replies to this (after the
unintelligible distinctions of the Schools) and seems most to trust to, even
such wise Similitudes as these, that the Soul is greater than the Body, and yet
is contained within it; that a great Mountain is contained in the little Apple
of the Eye; and the greatest Bodies in a little Looking-glass, and great
Virtues in little precious Stones, and in the Little Body of the Pope great
Authority, etc.

6. Ibid. 15. Imposs. fol. 135.
The Jew says, you Christians affirm that your Christ is in like manner on more
Altars where Masses are celebrated. This seems to be impossible, because it is
impossible for one Body to exist in more places than one. But it is plain that
this Sacrament is celebrated in more Places. Therefore it seems impossible that
the Body of Christ should be truly contained in this Sacrament. Unless perhaps
any should say, that according to one part of it, it is here, and according to
another Part elsewhere. But from thence it would again follow, that by the
Celebration of this Sacrament the Body of Christ is divided into Parts; when
yet the Quantity of the Body of Christ seems not to suffice for the dividing so
many Particles out of it, as there are Places in which this Sacrament is
performed.

7. You Christians say, that after Consecration, Ibid. 16. Imposs. fol. 136.
all the Accidents of Bread and Wine are manifestly perceived in this
Sacrament, viz. the Color, Taste, Smell, Figure, Quantity and Weight. About
which you cannot be deceived, because Sense is not deceived about its proper
Objects. Now these Accidents, as you assert, cannot be in the Body of Christ as
in their Subject. -- Nor can they subsist by themselves, seeing the Nature and
Essence of an Accident is to be in another thing (7. Metaphys.) For Accidents
seeing they are Forms, cannot be individuated but by their Subject; and if the
Subject were taken away, would be universal Forms. It remains therefore that
these Accidents are in their determinate Subjects, viz. In the substance of
Bread and Wine. Wherefore there is there the substance of Bread and Wine, and
not the substance of Christ's Body; for it seems impossible that two Bodies
should be together, (in one place.)

8. The Jews say, Ibid. 17. Imposs. fol. 137.
It is certain that if that Wine in your Sacrament were taken in great
Quantity, that it would heat (the Body) and intoxicate, as before it was a
Sacrament: and also that the Bread would strengthen and nourish. It seems also,
that if it be kept long and carelessly, it will corrupt; and it may be eaten of
Mice; the Bread and Wine also may be burnt and turned into Vapors; all which
cannot agree to the Body of Christ, seeing your Faith declares it to be
impassible. It seems therefore impossible, that the Body of Christ should be
contained substantially in this Sacrament.

9. The Jew says, Ibid. 18. Imposs. fol. 137.
That you Christians break that Sacrament into Parts; Therefore it is
impossible that the Body of Christ should be there. The Consequence is thus
proved: Because, that Fraction which does sensibly appear, cannot be without a
Subject. For it seems to be absurd to say, That the Subject of this Fraction is
Christ's Body. Therefore it is impossible Christ's Body should be there, but
only the Substance of Bread and Wine.

There is a great deal more of what the Jews say against this Doctrine, in that
Author: but this is enough, for the purposes I before mentioned (and so I leave
it to the Consciences of those concerned) to show, that even the Jews have
better explained the words whereby Christ instituted this Sacrament, than the
Romanists have, by making it a Figure of Christ's Body, and not the Body it
self, spoken more agreeably to the Faith of the Ancient Church, that did so;
and have confuted the Errors of this Church, by Maxims consonant to the Sense
and Reason of all Mankind. Which God grant they may be sensible of, who have
so manifestly swerved from them all, that so their Words may never rise up in
Judgment against them.
