The Merits of the Election of RICHARD WILLIAMS Esquire Burgess of Parliament for
the Borough of New Radnor, appointed to be heard on Wednesday the Third of
April, upon the Petition of WILLIAM PROBERT Esquire.
THE Borough of New Radnor, by the Charter bearing date 20o Julii, An. 4o Eliz.
is Incorporated by the Name of Bailiff, Alderdermen, and Burgesses, who are
empowered to send a Burgess to Parliament: And accordingly Richard Williams Esquire
was, by the unanimous Votes, and loud Acclamations of all the Burgesses of the
Shire-Town of Radnor, and the Burgesses of the out Boroughs then present, which
were above 300, duly elected and returned to serve for the last Convention,
there being not any Poll demanded, nor any Opposition made, your present
Petitioner, Mr. Probert, himself voting for Mr. Williams. Yet notwithstanding
the fairness of the said Election, the said Mr. Probert being desirous to give
Mr. Williams an unnecessary trouble in the said Election, has in his Petition
to the Honorable House of Commons, most falsely and malicious suggested, that
he was elected by the Burgesses of the out Boroughs.
