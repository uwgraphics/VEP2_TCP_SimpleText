My wife will be my Master. Or, The Married-man's Complaint against his unruly
Wife.
The Tune is, A Tailor is a man.


AS I was walking forth of late,
I heard a Man complaining,
^ith that I drew me near to him,
(...) know the cause and meaning
(...) this his sorrow, pain and grief,
^^ich bred him such disaster.
^^^s, quoth he, what shall I do,
^y wife will be my Master.
^^t if ever I am a Widower,
^^d another wife do marry,
(...) ^ean to keep her poor and bare,
and the purse I mean to carry.
^f I should give her forty pound,
within her apron ^^lding,
(...) longer then she is telling out,
her tongue would never leave scolding,
(...) Eso^s Dog barkt at the Moon,
^^^king for to distaste her,
(...) does my wife scold without cause,
and strives to be my Master;
(...) if ever, etc.
Were I so strong as Hercules,
or wiser then Apollo,
Or had I Icarus wings to fly,
my wife would after follow.
Or should I live as many years,
as ever did King Nestor,
Yet I do greatly stand in fear,
my wife would be my Master.
But if ever, etc.
I know no cause nor reason why,
that she with me should jangle,
I never gave her cause at all,
to make her with me wrangle;
I please her still in what I may,
and do no jot distaste her,
Yet she does strive both night and day,
always to be my Master,
But if ever I am a Widdower,
and another wife do marry.
I mean to keep her poor and bare,
and the purse I mean to carry.
My wife is my, etc.





I Every morning make a fire,
all which is done to ease her,
I get a Nutmeg, make a toast,
in hope therewith to please her;
Of a cup of nappy ale and spice,
of which she is first taster,
And yet this cros-grain'd queen will scold
and strive to be my master.
But if ever, etc.
I wash the dishes, wash the house,
I dress her wholesome diet,
I humor her in every thing,
because I would be quiet:
Of every several dish of meat,
she will surely be first taster,
And I am glad to pick the bones,
she is so much my master:
But if ever, etc.
Sometimes she will sit while day gives light
in company with good fellows,
In Taverns and in bowsing kens,
or in some pimping Alehouse;
and when she comes home drunk at night,
though I do not distaste her,
She Will fling she will throw, she will scratch and bite
and strive to be my Master.
But if ever, etc.
Her bed I make both soft and fine,
and put on shoos completely,
Her shoos and stockings I pull off,
and lay her down most neatly:
I cover her and keep her warm,
for fear I should distaste her,
I hug her kindly in my arms,
yet still she will be my master:
But if ever, etc.
And when I am with her in bed,
she does not use me well sir,
She Will wring my nose, and pull my ears,
a pitiful case to tell sir:
And when I am with her in bed,
not meaning to molest her,
She Will kick me out at the beds feet,
and so become my master:
But if ever, etc.
And thus you hear how cruelly
my wife does still abuse me;
At bed at board, at noon and night,
she always does misuse me:
But if I were a lusty Man,
and able for to bast her,
Then would I surely use some means,
that she should not be my master.
But if ever, etc.
You Batchelors that sweethearts have,
when as you are a VVooing,
Be sure you look before you leap,
for fear of your undoing:
The after wit is not the best,
and he that weds in have s;ir,
May like to me bewail his case,
if his wife do prove his Master:
But if ever, etc.
You Married Men that have good wives
I wish you deal well by them,
For they more precious are then gold,
if once you come to try them:
A good wife makes a husband glad,
then let him not distaste her,
But a scold will make a Man run mad,
if once she proves his Master,
But if ever, etc.
