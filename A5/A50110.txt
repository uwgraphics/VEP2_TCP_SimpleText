COme and assist my trembling Den,
while I endeavor to explain
The bloody minds of cruel men,
That will no wickedness refrain,
But bloody Humors to fulfill.
Innocent blood they daily spill.
Now my sad story I Will begin,
The like I think you never did hear,
How that Renowned Squire Thin
Was murtherd it does plain appear;
Their bloody minds for to fulfill,
This squire most horridly they kill.
On Sunday last this Gentleman
Clear of all Scandals o^ Reproach,
At several places he had been
With Noble Monmouth in his Coach,
This worthy person thought no ill,
Whilst Villians sought his blood to spill
And thus they passed the Streets along
Till seven or eight a Clock at night,
and then great Monmouth would be gone
In whom so much he did delight,
Poor soul he little thoug^t of ill,
while villains sought his blood to spi^^


His Grace he was no sooner gone,
But this sad accident befell,
By Villain(...)e was set upon
Near to a place that's call d Pell-mell,
Their ^^ellish minds they did fulfill
and there his precious blood did spill.
Up to his Coach these Villaies ride,
As by his ^ervants it is said,
Wit^ Weapons which the^ did provide
Whilst ^e poor soul was not afraid,
For harmless souls never fear no ill.
while villains seek their blood to spill
Meeting with him as they desired,
Their Hellish courage then grew hot,
Into his Coach at him they fired,
And into his belly him they shot,
And so like Villains him they killed,
and his most precious blood they spilled.
Away like Villains then they fled,
With horror doubtless in their mind,
This worthy soul three quarters dead,
Bleeding in the Coach they left behind:
Now had the Villains got their will
That sought his precious blood to spill
When these unwelcome tidings came
To Noble Monmouths wondering ear,
His courage which none ever could tame
Did on a sudden plain appear,
He strait pursued those that did spill
His precious blood that thought no ill
This Noble Hero did all night
Pursue these murthere rs all in vain,
Till ^ol with his resplendant light
Did to our sight return again,
But could not find those that did kill
That harmless soul as thought no ill
But Heaven did presently find out
What lovely Monmouth could not do,
I was well he was the Coach gone out,
Or he might have been murdered too.
I fear that they who this squire killd
Poor Jameys blood would seign ^^a^e spilled
These Villains they were seiz^d at last,
And brought before his Majesty,
This horrid thing they then confessed
Now Prisoners they in Newgate^^e,
And be conde^^ned no doubt they will,
that squire Thin's sweet blood and spill
