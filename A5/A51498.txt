TO Sir Theodore Janssen.
SIR,
THOUGH I make bold to Prefix your Name to this hasty Product of a Loyal Muse; I
do not presume to Impose it on your Generous Nature in the formal way of a
Dedication. I do it chiefly to acknowledge Obligations which my Poetical
Circumstances will not suffer me to return as I Wish. Too Happy, if I be not
thought one of those designing Debtors who come to own a Debt to have an
opportunity of Enlarging it. Your Zeal for his Majesty and the Public good has
justly distinguished you among the best and most useful of his Subjects; and as
it has biased you to think Favorably of the following Pieces in Manuscript, I
hope it will incline you to Honor them with your kind Acceptance now they
appear in Print. Had I been the Master of Leisure sufficient to have undertaken
a Poem more worthy this great Occasion, I would then have been Proud of
Devoting it to your Patronage. But as these Lines are, I wholly leave them to
their Fate; nor am I without Hopes of redeeming the Esteem of the Ingenious, by
something more valuable on this or some such Noble Theme. It Is what I am most
Ambitious of Attempting and what* I might doubtless compass, could I but Cloth
in Robes of Poetry some of those admirable Ideas which you have sometimes
Communicated to me on that great Subject. But Rich and set Dresses are
expensive and not so soon nor easily put on. Thus I must be content to let my
Muse appear in a loose Deshabille; perhaps, as well as other Females, she will be
liked never the worse for it, chiefly when Graced with her Singing and Dancing
Attendants. It Is for their sakes she goes a Revelling; and after all, if she
helps but to set 'em off on the Stage and make 'em Please, she may be said to
have done what the most topping Muse often endeavors in vain. So hard it is to
be Merry and Wise, if I may use the Expression. Those who know me well are
sensible that it is not for want of good Will that I give not now something of
more Moment; and others may consider that Poetry has its Curses, as well as
Blessings. Poets like Misers starve themselves for the meager satisfaction of
leaving behind them what may Divert others, the one Toyling for the bare Fame
of Wit, and the other for the Reputation of Wealth; where both should be put to
a better use. We should study to reconcile those two Benefits; and in that
follow your Prudent Example. But few can be so happy as to be Masters of your
moderation in a flourishing Youth, and a Plentiful Fortune, or blessed like you
with a sprightly Wit guided by a solid Wisdom, at once to use and Improve it.
You ever were a Friend to Ingenious Recreations, but your Application to
important Affairs, is always Predominant over the allurement of Pleasure when
it interferes with them. Even many of the Moments which you have retrieved from
your own private Concerns, have been devoted to Discoveries useful to the
Public; while I have been condemned to Drudge on Laborious Trifles, and Till
the barren Fields of Poetry for the precarious hopes of a slender Crop. Yet
give me leave, Sir, to do my self the Justice of putting you and others in mind
that my Application to this ungrateful Study was at First the Fruits of an
involuntary Idleness; being Deprived of a handsome Patrimony in France before
the War, and since that of the small Correspondence I had there, which is now
wholly lost. Thus I am Doomed to Write on, having nothing to trust to below but
my Pen, and the reviving Smiles of some generous Noblemen, among whom I make
bold with all due Veneration to mention the Great Mr. Montague; that vast and
most Happy Genius, whose profound Sagacity, Indefatigable Care, and Admirable
Conduct, have been so highly instrumental in Reforming the Coin, and restoring
the Credit of the Nation: Sudden and amazing Wonders, which being effected in
War, defeated the Hopes of the King's Enemies at home and abroad, and mightily
conduced to the Establishment of this glorious Peace. While the Muses are blessed
with such Patrons, we have reasonable Hopes of sharing the sweets of that
Universal Good, and of being more effectually inspired to sing the Praises of
those, to whom the World owes such mighty Blessings. As for my Humble Muse,
it is what she most earnestly desires, the rather since it may enable me to give
you some more Authentic Marks of the deep Respect, with which I subscribe my
self,

SIR, Your most Humble Servant, P. MOTTEUX

A PANEGYRICAL POEM ON His MAJESTY. As a PROLOGUE to this Interlude
Spoken by Mr. Hodgson.
WHEN Britain welcomes her Returning Lord,
For Peace, for Freedom, for Himself Restored:
Our Joy's should, like our Blessings, be extreme,
And Praise should wanton in its boundless Theme:
The King has found so many Ways to Bless,
What Muse can even her private Debt express?
Let joyful Throngs then sing their Gain's Increase,
Since Britain's Soul on War engendered Peace;
Peace given the World her Parent to Adorn,
Got in his Camp, and in his Palace Born.
Let others sing how He his Thunder hurled,
And proved, like Jove, the Umpire of the World;
How, even opposing Foes, his Fame advance,
France shook the Globe, but William humbl'd France:
How wondering Kings from distant Empires came,
And found the Hero greater than his Fame;
Even when remote, like the Sun's active Ball,
Seeing, enlivening, and Controuling all;
King over Kings, by their free Choice assigned,
Lord of his Fate, yet Master of his Mind;
By wise Delays, even Master of his Foes,
Yet to the World's Command, preferring its Repose.
In Wonder lost, the Muses humble Train,
Wished but to sing how by his Toils they gain:
But how can Words our grateful Thoughts display?
Or what are Thoughts, such Blessings to repay?
Born to give Liberty to each Degree;
He even the Stage from Slav'ry's Yoke did free.
In an expensive War, with wondering Eyes,
The Muses saw New Theaters arise.
Wit from the Generous, large Supplies received,
And even the Play'rs, nay, even the Poets lived:
Nor did the Sound of War disturb our Sports,
While he, for hard Campains, disclaimed the Ease of Courts.
Oh! Now our Rest and Freedom are ensur'd,
May he enjoy the Pleasures he secured!
Taught by the Virtuous Ruler of our Isle,
The Stage, Reformed, has learnt a Chaster Style.
Even with the Pious, 'twill at last be famed,
For Virtue cherisht, and for Vice reclaimed:
Such Deeds in Peace, will prove the Monarch's Care,
Who, Boldly Wise, reformed the Coin in War.
Britain, it self a World, was first designed
To free the Greater, then adorn Mankind:
Ease (Freedom's best Attendant) here will raise
In heightened Souls, the Noble Lust of Praise.
Royal Academies shall grace the Age,
And many Dorsets Patronize the Stage.
To William's Court, all Noble Arts will run;
The Muses move still Westward like the Sun.
His Fame by them, and They by him shall live,
He who gave Peace, will every Blessing give.

EUROPE's REVELS, AN INTERLUDE.
Performed at the Theater in Little Lincolns-Inn-Fields, at the King's Return
after the Conclusion of the Peace.
Set to Music by Mr. John Eccles.
After a Warlike Symphony, an Alarm with Trumpets and Drums. Enter an English
Officer. ARm, Britons! hark! how from afar
Alarming Drums and Trumpets call to War.
" France, whose exerted Powers decrease, The Lines that are thus marked (")
are left out in the Singing lest the Performance should be too long.
"Collects them for a last Effort;
"But when she cannot fright, will court
"And bribe us into Peace.

Enter Britons. Officer. See how all the Brave assemble!
How they hurry
All to Glory!
William Thunders, Armies tremble.
Death or Conquest is the Cry.
Now we sally,
Now they fly;
Now they rally,
Charge, and dye.
Cannons roaring,
Squadrons pouring;
Shouting,
Routing,
We pursue 'em,
We Subdue 'em.
Rage and Horror, Groans and Fear,
Blood and Slaughter every where.

The Chorus with all the Instruments repeat the foregoing Lines from See how
all the Brave, etc. Enter a Lady at the Close of the Chorus, and the Martial
Music immediately changes, at her first Word, into softer Notes, with
accompaniments of Flutes Peace! Peace! Peace tunes the World: Harmonious Peace
Bids War and Discord cease.

Thus does it Heaven and William please,
William whom nothing can oppose,
Who can like Neptune calm the Seas,
And bless, like Jove, his very Foes.
Advance, happy Nations, to praise him, advance,
From Britain, from Spain, from Belgia, from France;
Sing William, and Peace, sing, revel, and dance.

Enter many People of several Nations: Among them a Spaniard, and a Spanish
Woman with Castanets; then a Dutch Boor and Boorin, a French Valet and
Waiting Woman, and an English Clown and his Wife dance after their Country
Fashion. After the four Nations have danced severally, the English Clown speaks
to the rest. Eng. Clo. Hold Neighbors; since our Country has set you all a
Dancing, you shall eene dance after our Country Fashion: As for my Brother Hans
the Dutchman, his Hopping, (Dancing I should have said) agrees well enough
with mine; As well, I cot, as the Fiddle and the Dancing Bear.


Dutchm. Yaw varacktick Broeder.


Most of the rest is omitted. Eng. Clo. But this Outlandish Spaniard; And you,
Master Monsieur, don't foot it a whit like unto us; why, you wriggle and frisk
about like the Hobby Horse in a Morris; but that is no wonder, for they say the
very Dogs, Heaven bless us! dance in your Country. Then there is he there
bristles like one of our Turkeys; stalks about like a Boy on a pair of Stilts,
and snaps his Fingers like Roger our Barber, or like the Puppet in the
Recreation of the orld.


Eng. Woe. Come Husband we will e'ne change Partners; let me alone for teaching
one of the Gentlefolks.


Eng. Clo. Odszooks, you're in woundy haste to be doing with Gentlefolks, goody
Nimble-hips: These Wives are always plaguey ready to change Partners, and shake
their Tails with Strangers: Well no matter, there is the French Monsieur, go
bestir your Stumps together: Let Jack Spaniard take Hans the Dutch-mans Vroe;
And let her be sure to put him in when he is out: Come Master Signior, As my
Dame says, We Will change Wives; Odszooks, that is all the Fashion with us now
adays; were not for changing now and then, there would not be half the Dancing
that there is among us -- Hey-day! I fancy this same Spaniard is like most
other folks, he does not care any Body should dance with his Wife; But he is for
dancing with every body's Wife but his own. Od's niggs, it is all a Case; for
once it shall be as I say: Come Cuckolds all arow. -- Play me an English
Horn-pipe.


A French Officer makes his Adresses to an English Lady. Fr. Off. Madame, me
be, de tout Mon Coeur,
Your very humble Serviteur.
Begar me wish to have de Peace,
Only to come embrace your Knees.
Your Roy Guillaume is brave en Diable;
Me saw him take Namur dat's impregnable.
'We all looked on, for we had den
'But hundra twenty tousan Men.
Your Soldier can do Wonders too*
And love to Fight as we to Dance*
But had day all been such as you,
Begar, dey would have Conquer France.

E. Lad. Still the same I find you are,
Skilled alike in Love and War.
Gallantry in both you show,
But a little Falsehood too;
And with Strong deluding Art,
Win a Fort, or bribe a Heart;
Though it is like Inconstant Men,
But to give 'em up again.

French Of. We be like all de Vorld indeed,
And give up vat we cannot keep;
But if me get Possession here,
Me never give you up, Begar.

Struggles with her. Eng. Lady. Forbear, forbear!


Er. Of. Ma Chere! My Dear!


Engl. L. It Is all in vain.


Fr. Off. Is It all in vain?


Eng. L. It Is all in vain.


Fr. Off. Is It all in vain? Jer'nie! me then -- -
me, -- Begar, me go home again.

Both. Adieu, adieu, go home again.

To him a French Woman. 'Oh! Vat do I see?
'Will dis Ingrat still vanton be,
'And to gain oders Ruin me?

E. Lad. 'Let roving Thoughts and wandering cease,
'And sigh no more for Foreign Charms:
'At Home enjoy the sweets of Peace,
'In your fond faithful Consorts Arms.

All three repeat the last four Lines An English Officer to the English Lady.
He. 'Now, my Dear the War is over,
'And I can be wholly thine.
'Come be kind: Yield to your Lover,
'And no Flame shall last like mine.

She. 'Hold, Sir Bully! who'd surrender
'When the Siege is hardly laid?
''Tis not every bold Pretender,
'Whose first Summons is obeyed.

He. ''Tis our way now to be daring,
'And at once to come and take;
'Pressing, storming, without caring,
'What Resistance you can make.

She. 'Feeble Towns may thus be taken,
'Chiefly when surpised or sold;
'Then they are plundered, and forsaken;
'But I can defend my Hold.

He. 'You'll be used as ill, if early
'On good Terms you do not yield.

She. 'I'm ashamed to beat a Parley, Bashfully.
'But you're Master of the Field.

He. 'You shall be well treated; fear not:
'Let the Fortress be resigned.

She. 'Oh! Your Servant, Sir, I dare not,
''Till the Articles are Signed.

Both. 'Come, it is just it should be so,
'Since, like Foes, all Lovers deal:
'Here's my Hand, now let us go,
'And within we'll Sign and Seal.

Exeunt. A CLOWN.
'Come Neighbors, now there is Peace let us Sing:
'Troth I love those that love the King.
'To see his Liege, I came alone,
'And left the Parson with my Joane.
*Jog Joggy, jog on; drive, drive on the Wagon:
'Go Gaffer, jog on, go, get us a Flaggon.
2.
'Our Landlords thought the Taxes deep;
'But we must Sow e're we can Reap.
'What Clown can grudge his Money now?
'Odsnigs, not I; and so, God speed the Plow.
'Jog, Joggy, jog on; drive, drive on the Wagon,
'Go, Gaffer, jog on; go get us a Flaggon.
Enter an Irish Rapparee. 1.
Hub, ub ub, booh
Dish cannot be true:
The War does cease,
But there is no Peace.
I know, and find
It Is Sealed and Signed,
But will not believe it is true.
Hubub, ub, booh.
2.
A hohne! a hohne!
Poor Teague's undone.
I dare not be
A Raparee:
I never shall see,
Magrawmacree, His Mistress.
Nor my more dear Garon.
A hohne! a hohne.
3.
Away, away!
I must huzzah:
'Twill hide my Fears,
And save my Ears;
The Mob appears.
Here Is to Nassau,
Dear Joys it is Usquebaugh.
Huzzah! Huzzah!
A Country Lass.
Come Girls, let us be merry; the War's at an end;
We all shall get Husbands: The times now will mend:
There Is I and our Mary,
Black Susan and Sarah,
Were Woundily Weary,
With living Unwed;
In a woeful quandary,
How we should do to tarry.
None asked me to Marry,
Or part with my Maidenhead.
Our best Lads to the Wars went so fast,
And the rest were most of them such Loobies,
E Cod, I feared we at last
Must have suiter'd the Lubberly Boobies.
Enter a Soldier, who runs and kisses her. Dear Joany,
My Honey.
What have thou forgot me? O -- How the Wench Stares!
I Am Thomas the Thresher, just come from the Wars.
I Am still thy Swee^-heart; and by Cannons and Mortars,
I Will take thee by Storm; and I Will beat up thy Quarters.
He. By Cannons and Mortars,
I Will beat up thy Quarters.

She. Hold, Thomas! you may not
Nay, Thomas you sha' not.

She. Go, I hate you, I vow;
You look, and you talk like a Gentleman now:
Come, off with this Geer,
And d'on the Reparel, that once you did wear.
Go, I hate you, I vow.
You look, and you talk like a Gentleman now.

He. Well since the War's over, my Brav'ry shall down.
Off goes the brave Soldier, on goes the plain Clown.

He pulls off his Red Coat, Throws down his Arms and his Wig, and appears, in a
Moment, dressed like a Country Fellow; she leers on him all the while; and then
at last runs and kisses him. She. Oh now* how I like thee! Oh now I Am thy own!
Thou art Handsomer now,
And finer, I vow,
Than all the spruce Gentry and Boars in our Town.

Both Merrily. Thus now we agree.
Let all do like me, She, Like thee.
To keep their Necks free.
Leave threshing of Jackets, and get 'em all Wives;
Then thresh in their Barns, with a thump, thump, thump;
Then thresh in their Barns, and lead all merry Lives.
Enter a Young Savoyard with a Rareeshow. O Rareeshow! brave Show*

Sings the Savoyard's Ditty, and Exit. Twelve Grenadeers rejoice for the King's
Return, and exercise at the sound of the Hautbois and other Instruments. The
Grand Chorus.
Rejoice, rejoice, the World has Rest,
William returns, and all are blessed.
He comes, he comes, the best of Kings;
More welcome than the Peace he brings.
Run to meet him,
Haste to greet him.
In lofty Notes sound William's Praise!
Sing gentle Peace in softest Lays!
Hail! Ye great Blessings of Mankind!
Glorious William! gentle Peace!
Live and reign for ever joined.

The End of the Interlude.
Words for a single Song on the Kings Return. Designed for a Private
Performance.
Come, let us revel, drink, and sing,
We have a Peace, we have our King,
Now, Britain, you are a happy Nation.
Thy Lord, whose Toyls the World have freed,
That like a Chaos disagreed,
May rest, and view his new Creation.
There Is nothing left for thee to do,
But to thy self, thy self be true,
And joyful homage pay him.
You Are loved, admird, and feared abroad;
Rebellion's quelled, and Faction's awed:
Command the World while you obey him!
See! Britain's happy Sons rejoyee!
Now Heaven and Peace confirm our Choice.
We Are happy all,
The great, the Small,
The Old, the Young,
The Weak, the Strong,
The Poor who wants,
The Rich who grants,
The Saint who cants,
The Rake who rants,
The thoughtless Squire, the thinking Wit,
The trusted Beau, the trusting Cit;
The Clown, the Lawyer, the Tarpawlin,
And every Sect, and every Calling.
All think of new Blessings, new Plenty will reign,
The Richer will save, and the poorer will gain.
The Toper in Claret will find all his Wants,
And the Clown in right Nants,
Will whip off his Noggin;
The Matron her cold Tea will sip,
The Saylor his Punch and his Flip,
And the Bawd her flaming Snapdragon.
Thus all hearts are eased,
And new Joys on us call;
For his own private Good each of us is pleased,
And the King for the good of us all.
FINIS.
