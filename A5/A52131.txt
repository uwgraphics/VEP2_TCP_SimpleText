To Balance your Leidger in order to transport into New Books. Observe;

Balanced your Books.

Note, The Account of Stock in your New Leidger, will be the exact Transcript
of the Account of Balance in your Old; the order only inverted; Viz. The
Accounts on the Debtor side of Balance (being Debitors to you) must therefore
be Copyed on the Credit side of your New Account of Stock. And the Accounts on
the Credit side of Balance (to whom you are indebted) must (for the same
reason) be entered on the Debtor side thereof.
