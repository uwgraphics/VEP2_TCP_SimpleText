An Extract of the Registers of the Resolutions of the High and Mighty Lords,
the States General of the United Provinces, of the Netherlands.
Thursday the 14th. October. 1688.
AFter having heard the Report of the Sieurs de Heeckeren, and the other
Deputies of their Lordships for Foreign Affairs, who in order to the
performing their Resolution of the 11th of this Month, have seen and examined
the Memorial of which the Marquis d'Albeville, Envoy Extraordinary of His
Majesty of Great Britain, had presented unto them the 8th of the last Month,
and on the 6th of this instant, mentioned more at large in the Acts of the said
Day, and having thereupon maturely deliberated, their Lordships have thought
sit, and resolved to return in Answer to the said Marquis d'Albeville, That
their Lordships having seen the Declaration, which the French Ambassador had
made them as well by Word of Mouth, as in Writing in a Public Audience, the
9th of September last, That His Most Christian Majesty had the strictest
Engagements of Friendship and Alliance with His Majesty of Great Britain, as
is expressed in the said Declaration, their Lordships do believe they have
reason to demand a more plain and clear Explanation of the matter in Terms more
agreeable and civil. And since it has pleased His Majesty of Great Britain,
most seriously to disclaim them, (as prejudicial to this State) they do
declare, That they neither have had, nor have any Intention to enter into a War
with His Majesty, or with the English Nation, for whom they have the most dear
Regard; and that there is no People with whom they more heartily desire to live
in a cordial and sincere Friendship with, than with His Majesty and the said
Nation. That with the greatest Regret they have seen and observed, how those
who envy such their Happiness, have endeavored to excite in His Majesty great
Discontents toward this State, and to give him public Marks of it, such their
Malice; because they see, to their great Grief, the Discontents which the
irregular Conduct of some Men have given to the Nation, as well in regard of
the Reformed Religion, as of the Liberty and Security of the Nation. That their
Lordships do wish nothing more than to see the said Discontents sincerely and
absolutely taken away, the Reformed Religion maintained and established, and
the Liberty of the Nation preserved; to the end that His Majesty and the
Nation, may thus re-enter into a good Understanding and Confidence in each
another, and that they do Sincerely and in Truth protest, That they have no
other End or Design, than the desired Quiet of His Majesty's Kingdoms, and his
Powerful Cooperating with them for the Preservation of the Peace of Nimeguen,
and the Treaties which have since followed.

FINIS.
