A New Scotch Whim.

I.
DEel faw mine Ey'ne
If ever Ise ken
Syke a Parcel of Loons in a Nation.
Since the Lord of the Boyn
Does Covet mere Coin,
They repent of their geud Abdication.
For the Loons of the Kirk
Do now find their Work
Is a muckle too big for their Purses;
And the War that is begun
by the geud valiant Son,
Will be Crowned with a Trophee of Curses.
II.
What a Deelish stir
We make with War,
To confoond our Estates for Ambition,
With a crafty Pretense
Of conquering France,
To drill out the Coin of our Nation.
'Twas a muckle thing
To exchange our King,
Lubber-Loons have got weel by the Barter;
For our geud valiant Prince
Takes the faw Loon of France
As the stoot bonny Scot teuk the Tartar.
Edinburgh: Printed in the Year, 1693.
