Captain General of all His Majesty's Forces by Sea or Land, for that Kingdom.

THE DECLARATION OF HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES Marquis of Montrosse, Earl of
Kincairn, Lord Greme, Baron of Mont-Dieu, Lieutenant Governor of Scotland, and
Captain General of all His Majesty's Forces by Sea or Land for that Kingdom.
HOwever the Justice of His Majesty's cause, the wickedness of those Rebels,
and my own Integrity, are all of them so clear and evident, that to do any
thing which in the least measure may seem to descend to a dispute, or to hold
such enemies as a considerable party, may rather be interpreted as an act both
of public injustice to his sacred Majesty, and private injury to my self,
then of Duty, or Equity: Yet the further to confirm the world in a truth so
generally known, and acknowledged, the more to encourage those who will Engage
with me, and the more powerfully to disabuse those, who have hitherto
unwillingly been involved, and out of their simplicity inveigled in those
desperate courses* I do in the name of his most sacred Majesty, and by virtue
of the po^^^, and authority by Him granted to me DECLARE.

THat howbeit there has been (and still is) a most Horrid, and Infamous
faction of Rebels, in the Kingdom of Scotland, who as at first they did hatch
a most groundless Rebellion against his Majesty of ever glorious memory, so
when his Majesty had granted them (by their own confession) even all their
violent and most injust demands, they were notwithstanding so far from being
satisfied therewith, that (being themselves unable to find any further
pretenses) they did perjuriously solicit a party in the Kingdom of England
to begin there, where shame or necessity had forced them to break off. And
when the English (being, by much, less wicked) would often have been contented
with his Majesty's extraordinary Concessions, for as then many did not intend
those desperate lengths (which the fa^all success of a Rebellious war, and
the cruel craf^i^esse of some m^licious, hollow-hearted men did thereafter
drive them unto) these notable J^gglers, (to add oil to the fire, and to keep
green wounds still raw) did intrude themselves into their counsels, till they
had brought: affairs into a condition past all cure. And not contented to act
this their so b^oudie a Tragedi^ in the fox skin alone, or as it were behind
the hangings, (which indeed could never have compassed all their wicked ends)
when they had received all Imaginable satisfaction at home (wi^nesse their very
own public Acts of Parliament, wherein they confess that His Late M^j^sty
parted a contented King from a contented people.) They pull off the (...), and
appea^e in that of a Lion, or rather a Wolf, a beast, as far less Generou^,
so far more Cruel. For when they found their Rebell-brood, which they had
begot in Eng^and, begin to lessen, and that his Majesty's party appeared to
have by much the better, They, (not only contrary to the duty of Subjects,
but also contrary to all Faith, Covenants, Oaths, Attestations, to which they
had so often invoked God, his Angels, and all the world as witness,) did
enter the Kingdom^ of England with a strong Army, did persecute their own
Prince in a foreign Country, did assist strange Rebels against their native
King, and all those who continued in their Loyalty to his Majesty in that
Kingdom; which traiterous p^oceedings of theirs, the whole world does know,
was the only cause which stopped the course of his Majesty's victories, and of
bringing that unnatural war to such a conclusion, as all good men could have
wished.

And not ashamed of all this (which even many of their own party do blush to
own) when his late Majesty reduced (by God knows how many Treacheri^s) to
think upon courses of greatest extremity for his safety, was pleased (of his
invincible goodness, and natural inclination toward his own native people,
notwithstanding all their former Treasons and Rebellions) to commit himself to
the protection of that Ignoble, and Ungrateful faction, hoping that whom his
Greatness, and their own duty could not oblige, His misery at least, and an
act of so great Trust, and Confidence, might move to pity, and Compassion:
They, contrary to all Faith, and pactions, Duty of Subjects, Laws of
Hospitality, Nature, Nations Divine, or Humane, an action so barbarous, (which
as it never had any president that it may follow, so we hope it will never be
followed by any subsequent imitation) most infamousl^, and beyond all possible
expressions of Baseness, to the blush of Christians, and the abomination of
all mankind) sold their Sovereign to their merciless fellow-Rebells, and
fellow-Traitors, to be by them Murdered. For it is more then too too evident
by the frequent, and secret intercourses both before, and at the time of that
horrid, never enough detested parricide, and by their mutual correspondence,
and familiarity since, that the Rebellious factions in both Nations did
unanimously conspire and plot the Destruction of His late Gracious Majesty, now
a glorious Martyr: nor is it a small aggravation (if any circumstance can
aggravate so bloody a deed) that his late Majesty justly jealous of their more
then Punick faiths, did resolve first to engage them to his protection before
he would put himself into their hands; of which by a long Treaty and many
intercourses he received all manner of Assurance. This indeed they are so much
ashamed of, that they would gladly cover it with some frivolous excuses; yet
the secret guilt of their own consciences, and the Public knowledge the World
has of so undeniable a Truth, shuts up even their most im^udent mouths in
silence.

And so little are these God^ie* and Religious men touched with any sense of
what mischieves they have already done, that they begin afresh with his
Majesty Our now Gracious Sovereign upon the same score, where they left with
his Father of ever blessed memory. They Declare him indeed to be their King,
but with such conditions, and provisoes, as Robb him of all right and power.
For while they pretend to give him a little, which he must accept of as from
them, they spoil him of all that power and authority, which the Law of God, of
Nature, and of the Land, has invested him with, by so long continued descent
from his famous predecessors: They press him to join with those, who by a
sacrilegious Covenant have confederated all his Dominions in Rebellion, and
laid all Royal power in the Dust, which in effect were nothing better then
that he himself should asperse with infamy the sacred memory of his ever
glorious Father, that he should with his own hands destroy himself, and ruin
all such, who have still been loyal to him in his thr^e Kingdoms. These are
the men, who first entering England solicited those of their faction to rise in
that desperate Rebellion (as a prolouge to the ensuing Tragedy which they
meant to act) These are they who were the chief, and maine instruments of all
the Battaills, slaughters, and bloody occasions within that or their own
Kingdom; These are they who sold their Sovereign, to a bloody and infamous
death; yea these are they, who still digg in his Grave, and who are more
pernitiously hatching the destruction of his present Majesty, by the same bare,
old, antiquated treacheries, then ever they did that of his most excellent, and
most innocent Father.

NOtwithstanding all which because the greatest part of the People of the
Kingdom of Scotland, has been hitherto ignorantly misguided to follow their
Leaders, not knowing the pernicious ends their wicked Counsels did drive at,
which they had wrapped up in specious coverings; but have now most of them (by
Gods mercy) their eyes opened, and their hearts inflamed to return (at least
in their desires) to their due obedience toward their most Gracious
Sovereign: And because even in the worst times there never ^anted a loyal
party of men of all sorts, and conditions, who still gave evident
Demonstrations of their unwearied loyallty and fidelity, their sincere duties
and affections to their dread Sovereign, His Majesty even in contemplation of
those righteous ones is moved with a tender passion of all such, who now at
last, have a true remorse, and do seriously repent them of their former
Error^, and wickedness.

His gracious Majesty therefore, out of a Fatherly affection to all his
people, and subjects, especially those of the Kingdom of Scotland, is not
only willing, and ready to pardon all, and every one (^xcepting such who upon
clear evidences shall be found guilty of that most damnable parricide on the
person of his Dear Father) who upon the sight or knowledge of this Our
Declaration, do immediately, or with the first possible opportunity, abandon
those Rebels, and rise, and join with us, and our Fo^c^s, in this present
service. But also promises in the word of a Prince, (which he desires all men
to be most assuredly persuaded of) that so soon as God shall be pleased to
enable him, he will with the advice, and consent of the lawful, and ordinary
supreme, Judicatories in that Kingdom, ratify and confirm whatever has been
done by his Royal Father, in order to their peace. Nor does his Majesty requi^e
or demand any more of them but that they would return to their dutyfull
obedience, and afford him their faithful Service to revenge that horrid
murder of his Royal Father, to reestabli^h himself in his just power and
Government, and to procure their own perpetual peace and happiness.

Wherefore, what ever true Scotch-man there is, who has any sense of his duty
left him toward God, his King, Country, Friends, Wife, Children, or Houses,
or would change (now at last) the Tyranny, violence, or oppression of those
Reb^lls, with the mild, and innocent Government of their just Prince, or
revenge the horrid and execrable murder of their sacred King, redeem their
Nation from infamy, and themselves from slavery, restore the present, and
oblige all ages to come. Let them as Christians, Subjects, Patriots, Friends,
Husbands, and Fathers, join th^mselves forthwith with us, in this present
service which is so full of Conscience, Duty, Honor, and all just interests.
And let no man so much fear, or apprehend things future, and uncertain, as
abhor those present evils, under which they groan, since no calamities can
match, much less outstrip, that vile and unjust servitude, which now oppresses
them. For however at the first blush the enterprise may seem hard, and full of
many and great difficulties, yet let not Christians and men of courage doubt of
Gods Justice, and that perpetual care wherewith he watches over Princes, or
their own resolutions, or the fortunes of those with whom they are joined, and
by whom they are Commanded. But let them resolve with Joab to play the men for
their people, and the Cities of their God. And let the Lord do what seems
him good wherein whatever shall befall them, they may, at least be assured of
CRASTINUS his recompense, that Dead, or a Live, the World will owe and pay them
deserved thanks.

MONTROSSE.

THe Declaration of the Scotts in answer to this of Montrosse, being very long,
and much of it, tending only to justify their proceedings while their Army
was in England, being that with which they have often vexed the Press before,
and which for the most part has received such Answers as were never replied
unto; I have thought fit to save the reading of that which is not to the
present purpose, to Extract out of their large Declaration only those Passages
that look at the person of Montrosse: this being intended, only to show the
world what Opinion they profess to have of each other.

EXTRACTS OUT OF A DECLARATION of the Committee of Estates of the Parliament of
Scotland, In Vindication of their proceedings from the aspersions of a
scandalous Pamphlet, published by that excommunicate Traitor, James Grahame,
under the title of a Declaration of James Marquis of Montrosse, etc. Printed
1649.
IT may seem strange to such as know the state of affairs in this Kingdom,
that we should think it worth the while to answer the slanders and groundless
reproaches of that viperous brood of Satan, James Grahame, whom the Estates of
Parliament have long since declared traitor, the Church has delivered into the
hands of the devil, and the Nation does generally detest and abhor. Since we
know there has been and will be in all ages a wicked rabble of godless men,
who make it their work to follow the righteous cause with aspersions and
calumnies, and it is an endless labor to answer every voice that speaks
against the truth; and seeing also at length the innocence of our cause, the
integrity of our hearts, and the candor of our actions will prevail over the
malicious tongues of our adversaries, yet because our silence may be subject to
misconstruction, and some of the weaker sort may be inveagled by the bold
assertions and railing accusations of this impudent Braggard, presenting
himself to the view of the world, clothed with his Majesty's Authority as
Lieutenant Governor and Captain General of this Kingdom: We shall shortly
answer what is said against us, take off the ma^ke which he has put on, and
expose him to public view in his own apparel.

This excommunicate Traitor in the first place, charge his own Nation with
hatching a Rebellion in this Kingdom, then with the promoting the like in
England, and lastly, with the sale and murder of their native King, and
robbing his Son of all right; horrid crimes indeed, if true: But, etc.

(...) 4.
His l^st and main forgeries against us, are, that his late Majesty being
red^cted to think on extreme courses, did engage us by a Treaty, and having
got all manner of assurance from us, did cast himself in the hands of our Army
which was sent into England for assistance of the two Houses of Parliament
against the Popish, Prelaticall and Malignant party; And that we, contrary to
all faith, p^ction and duty, sold our Sovereign, and afterward complotted his
destruction, and now begin upon the same score with the Son, d^claring him King
with provisoes, and robing him of all right while we would seem to give some
unto him, and are more perniciously hatching the destruction of his present
Majesty then ever we did his sacred Fathers.

What a strange contexture of multiplied lies does this malicious man heap
together? In all this, there is not one word true, save one, that his Majesty
was redacted to think on extreme courses, and that makes against him; for Sir
Thomas Fairfax, having defeated the Kings forces in the fields, suddenly
resolves to block up Oxford, where the King was in person, thinking that the
shortest way to put an end to their troubles, wherewith his Majesty being
surprised, privately escapes with two or three from Oxford, etc.

And that it is a malicious wicked device and manifest untruth, that we sold
our King; we abhor the very thought of it as sincerely as we do abhominate
the treacherous actions of that perfidious Traitor James Grahame, who, as a
child of the Devil, hates to speak truth.

wretched man, that we complotted his late Majesty's destruction, and have
Declared his Son King with provisoes, robbing him of all right, and are more
perniciously hatching the destruction of his present Majesty then ever we did
his royal Fathers. We say no person on earth has contributed more toward his
Majesty's ruin then James Grahame himself.

In the beginning of our troubles, the Lord having put it into the hearts of
his people of this Land to renew their national Covenant formerly taken by
King James, in the year 1580. That dissembling Hypocrite James Grahame, then
Earl of Montrosse, did with tears in his eyes, and both his hands lifted up
to Heaven swear the words of that Covenant unto the Lord, in the public
Assembly of his people; but being a man of a mean and desperate fortune, and
not meeting with that esteem and reward which be in his vanity, proposed to
himself, at the first pacification he began to hearken to the promises of the
Court, and to study a faction within; and hold correspondence with the adverse
pa^ty without the Kingdom, and by false information, to d^v^de his Maje^ty
from his people. ^is base and treacherous practices were dive^se times
discovered, and himself made ashamed, yet would he not give over until at
length he was made prisoner in the Castle of Edinburgh, and afterward brought
to his Trial before the Committee, for trial of plotters and incendiaries,
appointed by his Majesty, and the estates of Parliament, where he was found
guilty of perjury and treachery, and had he then received his due punishment
according to justice, he had not troubled the World since; but such was the
mercy and favor of his Majesty, and the Estates of Parliament, as he was
pardoned, and no further Censure inflicted upon him, but that his Majesty
declared and caused it to be inserted in the records of Parliament, that he
should be incapable of any office or place, in the Court or Common wealth, and
not have access to his Majesty's person; yet not long after his enlargement,
contrary to his own promise and the Articles of the large Treaty betwixt his
Majesty and this Kingdom, he repaired to his Majesty in England, and obtained
a Commission for invading his native Country, which shortly thereafter he did
attempt upon the South borders, and was repulsed, but rather then fail in his
designs, he choosed to join himself with that Barbarous crew of Popish Irish
Rebels, which invaded this Kingdom upon the North, with whose assistance (
and of some unnatural Countrymen, void of all Religion and humanity) taking
advantage of the qui^tnesse and security of this Kingdom, when their Armies
were abroad in England and Ireland, he did cruelly destroy with the Sword
diverse thousands of his own Countrymen, spoiled many of their goods, burned
Houses and Corns, ravished Women, murdered old and young, killed Ministers,
complied with Papists, countenanced Idolaters, and despised the Worship of God;
for which abominable Crimes, and his Rebellion and Treason, as he was
excommunicated by the Church, so he was declared Traitor by the Estates of
Parliament, his Coat of Arms torn, and his Estate forefaulted: But for all
this, he is not weary of committing wickedness, and therefore would return into
this Kingdom to over-act all his former transgressions and abominations. But
if he shall come, we trust in God it is that he may be brought to a shameful
death, and cursed end, and here receive from the hand of justice his deserved
punishment, where he has murdered so many of the Lords people, and
Julian-like has made Apostasy from that cause and Covenant to which he was so
Solemnly Engaged by Oath and Subscription.

To gain supplies abroad and assistance at home, this vain m^^ does publish
this his Declaration under the name and Title of Lieutenant Governor and
Captain General for his Majesty of the Kingdom of Scotland. Upon what bare
pretenses he did formerly obtain a Commission from his late Majesty to invade
this Kingdom, we shall not now descant, bu^ we are very sure that there was
scarce any act his Made could have done that was more destructive to his own
interest or more displeasing to this K^ngedom^, it being expressly contrary to
the ties and bands betwixt King and people; and here we may justly retort upon
James Grahame, that he does begin with the Son upon the same score that he left
with the Father, for whither he has really obtained such a Commision from his
Majesty, or does only abuse his name, certainly he is not capable of doing his
Majesty greater dis-service then is held forth in that Declaration. The King
received our Commissions in Holland, and the Parliaments Letter, and treated
with them, he denied that he had given any Commission to James Grahame, or any
other, to invade this Kingdom, and promised a further answer to our desires,
by an Express from himself which is never yet come unto us. The strain and
scope of the Declaration makes the whole N^tion, the party whom his Majesty
gives Commission to invade and destroy, for it condemns all the proceedings of
the Kingdom: even at the very first beginning of these troubles, as the
Rebellion of an horrid and infamous faction of Rebels, at first causlesly
ha^ched against his late Majesty of glorious memory, notwithstanding they were
approved by his Majesty in the year 1639. at the Treaty at Berwick, wherein
James Grahame himself was an actor and consenter. It condemns all the
proceedings of this Kingdom in the year 1640. notwithstanding his Majesty is
obliged in the large Treaty (which is ratified in the Parliament of both
Kingdoms) for himself and his successors by his promise in verbo Principis,
never to come in the contrary thereof, nor any thing therein contained, but to
hold the same firm and stable in all points, and that he shall cause it to be
truly observed by all his Majesty's Leidges, according to the tenor and
intent thereof for now and ever, these are the very words of the Treaty. And
now what can be imagined to be a security to the Subjects of this Kingdom, if
that which their King is solmnly engaged unto by promise, for himself and his
successors, in verbo Principis, and confirmed in the Parliaments of both
Kingdoms, shall not only be questioned, but their desires agreed unto by his
Majesty declared to be violent and most unjust. And all this is not enough to
quarrel Treaties and Established laws, and to accuse the whole Nation, but
they are by this Declaration accounted more wicked then any in England, or
I^^l^nd, this miserable miscreant is better pleased with the Sectaries or the
Irish Rebels, then with his native Country, wherein he declares his Apostasy
to be of such a stamp, as he can sooner reconcile with all the World, the^ with
the cause and Covenant, which he did once swear to maintain and defend. If he
may but sit and judge all those in the Kingdom, who have kept the Oath of God,
and made conscience of their Covenant, shall be found accessory to the murder
and ruin of the King, and all those who have perjured themselves, and made
apostasy from the cause and Covenant, as he has done, shall be justified as
the only righteous persons of the Nation, as he is pleased to style them in
his Declaration. Neither is this the height of his insolency and ambition, but
in the Frontispeice of that Pamphlet he is exalted to be Governor of Scotland,
as if it were a Province or Conquered Nation, a title which our Ancestors would
never endure in the person of any but the King, and we trust in God it shall
never take place in this nor any subsequent Generation. Is it not a sad and
lamentable thing, that when his Majesty has lost possession of the Kingdom of
England, is in little better condition for Ireland, and only Scotland is
desirous to embrace him, upon grant of their just desires, there should yet be
such Counselors about his Majesty, as would advise him no other ways to come
to his Throne in Scotland, but by Conquest, and before the Conquest be made, to
declare the Governor, and to choose that Governor, such a one as is more
generally hated by many degrees, then any person of the Nation. What greater
provocations can be given then these? Or what design worse then this, can be
set on Foot to make his Majesty and his people irreconcilable? but we know
that no bounds can be set to the wickedness of this malicious man, who had
rather see both King and Kingdom utterly ruined, then that his own designs
should fail, and therefore we are very unwilling to think that these things
are done with his Majesty's knowledge and approbation, but rather that his
Majesty's Name is abused in that pretended Declaration, or if there has been
any Commission granted unto him, that it has been surreptitiously purchased
from his Majesty; in which opinion we desire to rest, and shall patiently wait
for his Majesty's Answer to our desires now again presented to his Majesty in
the Isle of Jersey.

These things being duly weighed and considered by foreign Princes and States,
we trust that since we have never done any injury or wrong to them, but have
rather been ready to perform all friendly duties in our power, as we have had
occasion and opportunity, and seeing we only desire to enjoy our Religion and
Liberties under his Majesty, according to the word of God, and the Laws and
Constitutions of this Ki^k and Kingdom, and are most willing, upon just
satisfaction given to our desires presented to his Majesty, and published to
the world in Print, not only to receive his Majesty, and submit to his
Government; but also to contribute our best endeavoure by all lawful and
necessary means according to the Covenant, and the duty of faithful Subjects,
that his Majesty may be restored to the peaceable possession of the Government
of his other Kingdoms; they will be mindful of that Common Rule of Justice
known by the light of nature, and confirmed by our Savior Christ, Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do so to them. And therefore as they
would expect from us in the like case, we do expect from them that they will
neither contribute men nor moneys, nor any other and or assistance to a
declared Traitor, who is neither seeking his Majesty's honor and happiness,
nor the good of his native Country, but merely to satisfy his own lusts and
ambitious ends, and designs.

But in a special manner we do expect from all Protestant Princes and States,
that they will remember what is said to Jehosapht for assisting Achab. Should
thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath
upon thee from before the Lord. And that as they desire to keep the Communion
of Saints, they will forbear to give him either countenance or assistance, but
look upon him as a person justly excluded from civil society for his
Treasonable practices, and excommunicated from the Church of Christ, for his
a^^minable transgressions.

If he shall come into this Kingdom, we are confiden^ that all those in whom
the sense of the fear of God, duty to the King, and affections to their native
Country, is not utterly decayed and extinguished, will heartily and
unanimously join to resist and oppose him, and to use their best endeavors,
that he may be brought to condign and exemplary punishment.

But if there shall be any found in the land so foolish, base, and treacherous,
as to hearken to the vain promises, and empty professions of that scandalous,
wicked, and infamous Pamphlet, published under the name of a Declaration of his
Excellency James Marquess of Monrosse; Lieutenant Governor, and Captain
General for his Majesty of the Kingdom of Scotland, (which in detestation
thereof, we have caused burn publicly at the Cross of Edinburgh, by the
hand of the Common Hangman) and shall aid or assist the said James Grahame, in
his wicked designs against Religion, King, and Kingdom. We do hereby
declare all such as shall join or concur with him or his adherents in arms,
to be guilty of High Treason, and to be punished and proceeded against as the
Parliament or their Committees, shall think fit; And do further discharge all
persons of whatsoever quality or degree, to join with them in any Oath, Band,
or Association whatsoever, or to assist or supply them and their adherents, or
any of them with Men, Money, Arms, Ammunition, Victual, Counsel, or
Intelligence, or to keep any sort of correspondence public or private with
them, or any ways to aid or countenance them, or any of them, under the pain
of being esteemed as Rebels, and proceeded against as the Parliament or their
Committees shall think fit; and this we declare to be instead of all Letters
of intercommoning. And Power and War and is hereby given to all good Subjects
within the Kingdom, to rise in Arms for opposing and suppressing all such as
shall join in Rebellion, as they shall be called and required thereunto by the
Lord General, Lieutenant General, or any others having authority for that
effect. And for the encouragement of al^ such as shall suffer in opposing or
suppressing them, We do further declare, that not only the losses and
sufferings of such as shall be active in the cause against them, shall be taken
in special consideration, and repaired out of the Estates of such as shall
join in Rebellion, as aforesaid; but their service shall be rewarded,
according as they shall be found to deserve; And we do ordain these presents
to be printed and published at the Market Cross of Edinburgh, and other
ordinary places of publication needful.

A. JONSTON. Clericus Registri.

EDINBURGH, 2. January 165^. Antemeridiem. The Declaration and Warning of the
Commission of the General Assembly unto all the Members of this Kirk and
Kingdom, In answer to a paper, entitled and reputed The Declaration of James
Grahame.
ALbeit the carriage of those who are engaged in the work of Reformation in
this Land has been from ^he beginning so agreeable to the rule of the Word of
God, and of sound reason, and so eminently owned and blessed by the Lord in all
the tenor and proc^dour thereof, as may sufficiently refute all the calumnies
of enemies, and strengthen his people against all their slanders and attempts
for undoing of the same; Yet least our silence in this day of blasphemy and
rebuke should be construed either as a neglect of our duty, or as weakness
through the sense of the guilt, to wipe off the aspersions that are vented to
the world in the name of that excommunicate and forfeited Traitor James
Grahame, we have resolved till there may be opportunity for a larger
Declaration, shortly to touch the revilings contained in that paper, and to
declare unto men their duty in reference to such purposes and desires as are
holden forth therein.

In the first place the instruments of the work of Reformation are charged as
an horrid and infamous faction of rebels, who did hatch a rebellion against
his late Majesty: But to say nothing that that wretched man was accessorie
unto the laying of the foundation of that blessed work, which now in the
blindness of his mind, and hardness of his heart, as being given up of God,
as Pharaoh was, he calls rebellion. This is no other then the common calumny
that has been cast upon the servants of God from the beginning of the world in
all their endeavors and attempts for Reformation of Religion: Was it rebellion
to stand to our defense, when in stead of an answer to all the earnest and
reiterated supplications and desires of this Land against the corruptions of
doctrine, worship, discipline, and government, we were invaded with an Army
both by Sea and Land, that a yoke might be wreathed about our necks by
oppression and violence? Not only had we the Lords Word, and the practice of
the reformed Churches abroad, and of our own Church at home in the days of
our Fathers to justify us in this, but also the King himself, who upon
information did retract the Declaration set forth against u^, and grant what we
had desired.

N^xt it is charge upon this Nation, that they did solicit a party in the
Kingdom of England to begin where they had left off, and that finding their
rebel brood there beginning to lessen, They did, contrary to all Faith,
Covenants, Oaths, etc. enter with a strong Army the Kingdom of England,
persecute their Prince in a foreign Nation, and assist a company of strangers
rebels against their native King, etc. What was the grounds and first rise of
the war betwixt the King and the Parliament of England, needs not now to be
repeated, being so well known every where; But this Nat^on were so far from
fomenting of the same, that for a long time they did mediate a peace; and so
continued, until England by their earnest invitation, did for the preservation
and Reformation of Religion, the honor and happiness of the King, the peace
and good of these Kingdome^, crave their assistance against the Popish,
Prelaticall and Malignant party then in Arms, who were like to have destroyed
all: For which end, when they had entered in a solemn League and Covenant with
that Nation, as they did oblige themselves for the defense and preservation of
his Majesty's Person and just Greatness and Authority in the defense and
preservation of Religion, so they did never desist to solici^ his Majesty for
satisfaction to the just desires of both Kingdoms, and were always, upon his
Majesty's granting of the same, willing to admit him to the exercise of his
Royal Power.

Thirdly, It is alleged, that after all manner of assurances given to his
Majesty before his coming to the Scottish Army, notwithstanding of
assurances, he was sold unto the English: But we are confident that albeit all
the generation of Malignants of the three Kingdoms have now for three years
together filled this and the Nations abroad with the noise of such things, that
yet to this day never any of them did, nor could bring any evidence of such
assurance given, or such bargain made by this Kingdom; nay such assurances
were always refused, and when the King did cast himself upon the Scottish
Army, this Kingdom was so far from making any sale of him, that they did not
condescend to leave him wit^ his Subject in England, until sufficient surety
was given by both Houses of Parliament, concerning the safety and preservation
of his Majesty's Person. It is ^reat malice to say, that because the Scottish
Army, about the time of al^ Majes^ies living at New Castle, did receive some
part of those arrears due unto them for their painful and faithful service in
England, that therefore this Kingdom did ^ell their King; The arrears which
were then received were due before the King came unto our Army, and in all
probability had been more timously and cheerfully paid if he had not come
thither at all.

Fourthly, They are slandered as complotters of the Kings destruction by secre^
intercourses both before, in the time, and since his Majesty's horrid murder:
If those things be evident, why were not the proofs brought forth and produced
before the world for convincing the authors and abetters thereof, and gaining
credit to the cause of those that make so bold alleagance? The public
endeavors and Testimonies of this Kirk and Kingdom against the taking of his
Majesty's life, do sufficiently refute all such secret and private whisperings.

Lastly, they are charged as robbers of the King, who now is of all right,
because of their declaring him King with provisoes: But are these provisoes or
conditions any other then such as have been in the time of his predecessors,
and whereunto by the Laws and constitutions of this Kingdom he is obliged,
and without which, Religion, and the peace of the Kingdom cannot be secured.

These, and the like slanders are made a ground of invitation unto the people
of this Land to abandon the cause, and work of Reformation, and to rise in
Arms against the Parliament and Kingdom, and join themselves with such
Forces as that Monster of men, and his accomplices shall make use of for invading
of this land; to which he labors to persuade a promise of pardon for what is
past, and of his Majesty's resolution to be ever ready to ratify, so soon as
it shall please God to put it in his power, according to the advice of the
supreme Judicatories of this Kingdom, all what has been done by his Royal
Father, in order to our peace. Though we should be silent and say nothing, we
are persuaded that there be none in the Land who has any regard to truth or
righteousness, or in whom any sponk of the love of the Lords work, or of this
Country does resid^, but as they abhominate and abhor the very name of that
excommunicate wretch, and think these lies worthy of no other entertainment
then is to be allowed to the devises of the Father o^ lies, unto whose hands he
is delivered; so we are confident that they will d^^est and avoid all such
desperate and wicked designs, attempted whither by him or by any other. Shall
men, after so many solemn vows and promises before the Lord, and his hand
lifted up so high in making plain before them, the way wherein they should
walk, be so blind and base, as to be charmed into a most godless course
against Religion and the blood of the Lords people by the offer of a pardon,
where there has been no transgression but a following of duty? Or shall any be
cheated into delusion by a flourish of most ambiguous words of his Majesty's
resolution to be ever ready to ratify, so soon as it shall please God to put
him in his power according to the advice of the supreme Judicatories of this
Kingdom, all what has been done by his royal Father in order to our peace?
To say nothing, that the League and Covenant and the Union betwixt the
Kingdoms, and the whole work of Uniformity, is here cut off at one clap,
though yet we trust that these things will be dearer to all the Lords people in
the Land, then their Estates or lives: The words are so empty and doubtful, as
may suffer any interpretation men list to put upon them, and may consist with
the utter undoing of all that has been done in this Land for asserting the
purity of Religion, and the liberty of the Subject.

His Majesty must first be put in power, before he engage himself to do any
thing at all, and when in power, no obligation upon him, unless the supreme
Judicatories of the Kingdom shall so advise; neither is it determined what
these judicatories are, whither his Majesty shall be obliged to follow the advice, and which is more strange, Religion is not so much as named in all the
concession, but all is wrapped under the notion of these things which the King
his royal Father granted in order to our peace: which may be so expounded as
to take in things Civil only that concern the peace of the Kingdom, or at
the best, insinuates the motive of all that his Majesty granted concerning
Religion to this Kingdom, to have been only a desire of peace, and not any
thing in Religion it self, and so draws along with it a secret reflection
upon the National Covenant, and all the work of God relating thereto, and
concludes them alterable as the change may produce peace or War.

We think we need not desire any man to consider what could be the case of
Religion, and of all that love is in this Land, if it were in the power of that
persidious and proud Atheist, to model the supreme Judicatories of the
Kingdom according to his mind: he who has so far forgotten his Covenant and
Oath, in which he enterd in so public and solemn a way, as to call all that is
contained therein, and has flowed there from violent and most unjust desires,
and the work of Reformation, from the beginning Rebellion, will not spare the
overturning and destroying thereof, and the bringing back this poor Nation to
the licking up of the vomit of prelacy, the ceremonies and the Service Book,
for making way to a fuller compliance with the Church of Rome: which we have
the more cause to fear, for that the free exercise and full liberty of Popish
Religion is granted by his Majesty to those bloody Rebels in Ireland. To us it
is above question, that as the alteration of Religion, and the establishing of
an arbitrary and i^ limited power for bringing the same about, was the design
from the beginning, so that the same is still promoted by the Popish,
Prelaticall, and Malignant party, and shall (if they prevail) be the fruit of
their works.

Therefore, as the Servants of the living God, we warn and obtest all the
Lords people throughout the Land, that as they would not draw on themselves the
wrath of the most high God, by breach of Covenant and gross backsl^dings, that
they do not hearken to any such calumni^s and slanders; nor suffer themselves
by the power thereof to be drawn from their steadfastness, or to give any
connivance, let be countenance or assistance unto any who shall invade this
Kingdom, or raise War therein, under pretense of Commission from his Majesty,
and putting him in the exercise of his Royal power before satisfaction had
from him, to the just and necessary desires of this Kirk and Kingdom,
concerning Religion and the Covenant. The late General Assembly, in their
Declaration, did by many grave and undeniable reasons, demonstrate the
unlawfullnesse and sinfullnesse of any such attempt; and it shall be now
seasonable for any man, who doubts to make use of these things for satisfying
his Judgment, and convincing him in the point of conscience, that he may not
dash himself against the rock of the Lords power, which shall certainly break
in pieces all those that oppose themselves to his work, and lead forth with the
workers of iniquity, all those that turn aside to their crooked ways.

Albeit, the avenging hand of the most high, has pursued and followed with
vengeance, many of those who assisted that unnatural man in the shedding of
the blood of his Country, and that many of them have tasted of the bitter
fruits both of civil and ecclesiastic censures, and that a temptation to so
great a wickedness from such a one as James Grahame, seem to be so gross as
may scarre most of the Malignant party themselves, who yet continue in
opposition to the work of God, let be those who have humbled themselves for
their former complyances with evil courses, or have kept their integrity
without swarving; yet it shall be the wisdom of all within the Land, to guard
their hearts by prayer and supplication, and to arm themselves with the
strength of the Lord against defection. Experience has proven throughout all
the tract of the word of God, that many has fallen off from day to day, and
that new trialls have produced new discoveries of the hollownesse of the hearts
of some, concerning whom many did promise to themselves better things; none can
be steadfast in the Covenant, but those, whose hearts are right with God: we
wish therefore every man to search and try his ways, and as to repent of all
his former provocations, so in the strength of the Mediator Jesus Christ, to
study to walk with God, and to order his conversation aright; then may we be
confident that the Lord shall establish us, and that no Weapon that is formed
against us shall prosper, and that every Tongue that rises against us in
Judgment we shall condemn.

HE that shall look back but a few years, and shall consider what these two
parties have done to and suffered by each other. And shall withal observe the
present Style and Language exchanged between them, will easily believe the
controversy such, the animosity so high, and the feu'd so deadly, as nothing
but the extirpation of one party is like to end and put it out

Unless that happy time were now ready to bless the world, when the Wolf
shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard lie down with the Kid; when none
shall any more hurt or destroy in all the holy Mountain of God, and the Earth
become full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the Sea.

But as it is, Montrosse is come into Scotland An incense Enemy, to the now
governing party there, engaged against them by his own Declaration, from
which he cannot recede with honor and reputation, to take up with less than
full satisfaction, were to plead guilty to all their accusation.

And he comes also provoked by this Declaration of theirs, wherein they have
represented him ( to the utmost power of Language) for such, as if they can
hereafter take hands with him, there will be little reason to doubt, but ( if
Interest should require it) they can also make an agreement with Hell it self;
for on this side THAT twill be hard to find any that may bear all those
Titles and Attributions they have bestowed upon him.

This Man comes amongst them to head a numerous discontented faction there. He
comes Armed with the ple^ipotency of full Commissions from their King, of
Generalissimo both by Sea and Land; signalized with Marks of his special
favor, in sending him lately from Jersey a little before his going thence the
Order of the Garter, besides those Caresses in his late Letter to him published
to the world.

How little the governing party in Scotland has gained upon their King, by
all their addresses to him this year past both in Holland and at Jersey, is
evident in his Letter to the Committee of Estates, sent by Libbertoun, which
has been also published.

The greatest hope left them of him, is, that his Mother (who meets him at
Beauv^is in his journey to Breda) will instill into him some of her Maxims and
Principles, that may divert him from Montrosse, and incline him to close with
them; which if she should effect in four days, (which he is determined to
stay there) or in eight, for so long it seems she would have the Conference
hold for his be^ter instruction, (if their purses will bear it) it would be
something strange, considering his known inclination to Montrosse, and perfect
hatred of the other.

If she do prevail, he is like to prove a blessed Instrument to promote or
settle the Reformation of Religion they so solemnly hold out, when he shall be
wrought to it by his Mother, and act upon her Principles, whose Religion is
believed to be as far from theirs, as theirs from the Sectaries.

It is a Riddle that the Queen his Mother should wish well to Presbytery. A
little time will show us the effects of her Counsels.

If she prevail with him to desert Montrosse, whom he has so entrusted,
empowered, Caressed, and dignified, what assurance can he give the Scotts, that
he will not also desert them, when his or his Mothers Interest shall require
it, and he shall have power to do it.

If he does continue to carry on his designs by Montrosse, are not they in a
sine condition the mean time, to suffer themselves to be rocked asleep by a
Treaty, till Montrosse shall be able to march all over Scotland?

But if it were but possible by some State Magic to charm the enmity
between Montrosse and the Scots, so as notwithstanding all the engagements,
and provocations of these Declarations, they should yet unite in one, to settle
their King, both among themselves, and also in these pretensions to England and
Ireland; were it not rare juggling? and were they not a fine parcel of men for
any people of this Nation to hold correspondency and Cabals withal? and to
hope by them to be delivered, from the Images of their grievances drawn and
multiplied in their fancies, by their causeless discontents.

Have they not had experience of their former coming into this Nation for ALL
OUR GOODS, and can any man believe after such juggling among themselves, they
are ever like to keep faith with any others?

If the the Conference at Beauvais, nor the Treaty at Breda, work neitheir of
these rare effects, but that the King of Scotland, follow his own natural
inclination to pursue his Interests, by Montrosse, Scotland will have work
enough to do and cause them though (perhaps) not time enough repent them, that
ever they espoused that quarrel which is like to prove so funest to their
POOR Kingdom.

This is Licensed to be Printed by Matthew Simmons, together with the
Declaration of Montrosse.

GUALTER FROST.
