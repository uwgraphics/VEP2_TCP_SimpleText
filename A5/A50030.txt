THE EPISTLE DIRECTORY, TO M. G. M. IN GRACIOUS Street in London.
Dear and loving friend, I received about ten days agon your letter of the
9. of this present: wherein you demand and solicit again the thing, that I so
flatly denied you, at my late being in your chamber: I mean to put in writing
the relation which then I made unto you, of the speech had this last Christmas
in my presence, between my right worshipful good friend and patron, and his
guest the old Lawyer, of some matters in our state and country. And for that
you ^presse me very seriously at this instant, both by request and many
reasons, to yield to your desire herein, and not only this, but also to give my
consent for the publishing of the same, by such secret means as you assure me
you can there find out: I have thought good to confer the whole matter with the
parties themselves, whom principally it concerns (who at the receipt of your
letter were not far from me:) And albeit at the first I found them averse and
nothing inclined to grant your demand: yet after upon consideration of your
reasons, and assurance of secrecy (especially for that there is nothing in the
same contained, repugnant to charity or to our bounden duty toward our most
gracious Princes or Country, but rather for the special good of them both,
and for the fore-warning of some dangers imminent to the same) they have
referred over the matter to me, yet with this Proviso, that they will know
nothing, nor yet yield consent to the publishing hereof, for fear of some
future flourish of the ragged Staff to come hereafter about their ears, if
their names should break forth: which (I trust) you will provide, shall never
happen, both for their security, and for your own. And with this I will end,
assuring you that within these five or six days, you shall receive the whole
in writing by another way and secret means, neither shall the bearer suspect
what he carries: whereof also I thought good to premonish you. And this shall
suffice for this time.

THE PREFACE OF THE CONFERENCE.
NOt long before the last Christmasse, Scholar.
I was requested by a letter from a very worshipful and grave Gentleman, whose
son was then my pupil in Cambridge, to repair with my said Scholar to a
certain house of his near London, and there to pass over the Holy Days in
^is company: The occ^si^n o^ h^s (...) and ^e^t^ng.
for that it was determined that in Hillary term following, his said son
should be placed in some Inn of Chancery, to follow the study of the
Common Law, and so to leave the University. This request was grateful unto me
in respect of the time, as also of the matter, but especially of the company.
For that, as I love much the young Gentelman, my pupil, for his towardlines in
religion, learning, and virtue: so much more I do reverence his Father, for
the riper possession of the same orn^ments, and for his great wisdom,
experience, and grave judgment in affairs of the world that do occur: but
namely touching our own Country, wherein truly I do not remember to have heard
any man in my life, discourse more substantially, indifferently, and with less
passion, more love and fidelity, then I have heard him. Which was the cause
that I took singular delight to be in his company, and refused no occasion to
enjoy the same. Which also he perceiving, dealt more openly and confidently
with me, then with many other of his friends, as by the relation following may
well appear.

The persons and place of this conference.
When I came to the foresaid House by London, I found there among other friends,
an ancient man that professed the law, and was come from London to keep his
Christmas in that place, with whom at diverse former times I had been well
acquainted, for that he haunted much the company of the said Gentleman my
friend, and was much trusted and used by him in matters of his profession, and
not a little beloved also for his good conversation, notwithstanding some
difference in religion between us. For albeit, this Lawyer was inclined to be a
Papist, yet was it with such moderation and reservation of his duty toward his
Prince and Country and proceedings of the same: as he seemed always to give
full satisfaction in this point to us that were of contrary opinion.

Neither did he let to protest oftentimes with great affection, A temperate
Pa^ist.
that as he had many friends and kinsfolk of contrary religion to himself: so
did he love them nevertheless for their different conscience, but leaving that
to God, was desirous to do them any friendship or service that he could, with
all affection, zeal, and fidelity. Neither was he wilful or obstinate in his
opinion, and much less reproachful in speech (as many of them be) but was
content to hear whatsoever we should say to the contrary (as often we did:)
and to read any book also that we delivered him, for his instruction.

Which temperate behavior, induced this Gentleman and me, to affect the more
his company, and to discourse as freely wi^h him in all occurrents, as if he
had been of our own religion.

THE ENTRANCE TO THE MATTER.
ONe d^y then of the Christmasse, we three r^tiring our selves after dinner,
into a large Gallery, for our recreation, (as often we were ^ccustomed to do,
when other went to car^s a and other^s pastimes:) this Lawyer by chance had in
his hand a little book, then newly set forth, containing A defense of the
public justice done of l^te in England, The book of Iust^ce.
upon diverse Priests and other Papists for treason: Which book, the Lawyer had
read to himself a little before, and was now putting it up into his po^ket;
But the Gentl^man my friend, who had read over the same once or twice in my
company before, would needs take the same into his hand again, and asked the
Lawyer his ju^gement upon the book.

The L^wyer answered: Law^er.
That it was evil penn^d in h^s op^nion to prove the guiltines of some persons
therein named in p^rticul^r, as also to persw^de in general, that the P^pistes
both abroad and at home, who meddle so earnes^ly wi^h def^nce and increase of
their religion (for these a^e not all, said he) do co^s^quently w^sh and
l^bo^r some change in the state: but yet whe^h^r so far forth, and in so
deep a degree of prop^r treason, as here in this book both in general and
particular (...) presumed and enforced, that (quo^h he) is some what hard (I
ween) for you or me (in respect of some other difference between us) to judge
or disce^ne with indifferency.

Gentleman.
Nay truly s^id the Gentleman, for my p^rt I think not so, for that reason is
reason in what religion soever. And for my self, I may protest, that I bear
the honest Papist (if there be any) no malice for his deceived conscience,
whe^of among others your self can be a witness: The Papists practices against
the state.
maty h^s Practices against the state, I cannot in any wise digest: and much
l^sse may the Commonwealth bear the same (whereof we all depend,) being a
sin of all other, the most heinous, and least pardonable. And therefore seeing
in this, you grant the Papist both in general ^broad, and at home, and in
particular such as are condemned, execu^ed and named in this book to be
guilty: how can you insinuate (as you do) that there is more presumed or
enfor^ed upon them by this book, then there is just cause so to do?

Lawyer.
Good Sir, said the other, I stand not here to examine the doings of my
superiors, or to d^fend the guilty, but wish heartily rather their pu^ishment
that have deserved the ^ame. Only this I say, for ^xplication of my former
speech: that men of a diff^rent relig^on from ^he state wherein they live, Two
sorts of dealing against the s^ate.
may be said to deal against the same state in two sorts: the one, by dealing
for the increase of their said different religion, which is alw^ies either
directly, Directly.
or indirectly against the state, (D^ectly) when the said religion contains
a^y point or article directly impugning the said ^a^e, (as perhaps you will say
that the Roman Religion does against the present state of England in the po^nt
of Suprem^cy: Indirectly.
) and (Indirectly) for that every different religion divides in a sort and
draws from the state, in that there is no man who in his heart would not wish
to have the chief Governor and state ^o be of his relig^on, if he could: and
conseq^ently misliketh the other in resp^ct of that: and in this kind, not only
those whom you call busy Papists in England, but also those whom we call hot
Puritans among you, (whose difference from the state especially in matters of
government is very well known) may be called all traitors, in mine opinion:
for that every one of these indeed, do labor indirectly, (if not more) against
the state, in how much soever each one end^avoureth to increase his part or
faction that ^^si^eth a Governor of his own religion.

And in this case also, The state of all Subjects is a state of different
religion.
are the Protestants in France and Flanders under Catholic Princes: the
Calvinists (as they are called;) under the Duke of Saxony, who is a Lutheran:
the Lutherans under Casimere, that favors C^lvinists: the Grecians and other
Christians under the Emperor of Constantinople, under the Sophy, under the
great Chame of Tarra^y, and under other Princes that agr^e not with them in
religion. All which Subjects do wish (no doubt) in their hearts, that they had
a Prince and state of their own religion, instead of that which now governs
them: and cons^quently in this first sense, they may be called all tr^y^ors,
and every act they do for adva^^ement of their said diffe^ent ^eligion
(dividing between the state and them) tends to treason: which their Princes
supposing, do sometimes make diverse of their acts treasonable or pun^shable for
treason. The second kind of treason.
Bu^ yet so long as they b^eake ^ot forth unto the second kind of treason which
contains some actual attemp^ or treaty against the life of the Prince, or
state, by rebellion or o^he^wise: We do not properly condemn them for
traitors, though they do some acts of their religion made treason by the
Prince his laws, who is of a different faith.

The application of the former example.
And so to apply this to my purpos^: I think, Sir, in good sooth, that in the
first kind of treason, as well the zealous P^pist, as also the Puritans in
England, may well be called and proved traitors; but in the second sort
(whereof we speak properly at this time) it cannot be so precisely answered,
for that there may be both guilty and guilties in each religion. And as I
cannot excuse all P^ritans in this point, so you cannot condemn all Papists,
as long as you take me and some other to be as we are.

Gentleman.
I grant your distinction of treasons to be true, (said the Gentleman,) as also
your application thereof to the Papists and Puritans (as you call them,) not to
want reason, if there be any of them that mislike the present state (as perhaps
there be:) al^eit for my part, I think these two kinds of treasons, which you
have put down, be rather diverse degrees then diverse kinds: wherein I will refer
me to the judgment of our Cambridge friend here present, whose skill is more
in logical distinctions. But yet my reason is this, that indeed the one is but
a step or degree to the other, not differing in nature, but rather in time,
ability or opportunity. For if (as in your former examples you have showed) the
Grecians under the Turk, and other Christians under other Princes of a
different religion, and as also the Papists and Puritans (as you ^earme them)
in England (for now this word shall pass between us for distinction sake,)
have such alienation of mind from their present regiment, and do covet so much
a governor and state of their own religion: Two degrees of treason.
then no doubt but they are also resolved to imply their forces for
accomplishing and bringing to pass their desires, if they had opportunity: and
so being now in the first degree or kind of treason, do want but occasion or
ability, to break into the second.

True Sir, said the Lawyer, Lawyer.
if there be no other cause or circumstance that may withhold them.

And what cause or circumstance may stay them I pray you (said the Gentleman)
when they shall have ability and opportunity to do a thing which they so much
desire? Gentleman.


Diverse causes (quoth the Lawyer) but especially and above all other (if it be
at home in their own Country) the fear of servitude under foreign nations,
Lawyer.
may restrain them from such attempts: as we see in Germany that both
Catholics and Protestants would join together, against any stranger that
should offer danger to their liberty. And so they did against Charles the
fifth. And in France not long ago, albeit the Protestants were up in arms
against their King, and could have been content, by the help of us in England,
to have put him down, and placed another of their own religion: yet when they
saw us once seized of New haven, France.
and so like to proceed to the recovery of some part of our states on that side
the Sea: they quickly joined with their ow^e Catholics again to ^xpell us.

In Flanders l^kewise, Flanders.
though Monsieur were called thither by the Protestants, especially for defense
of their religion, against the Spaniard: yet we see how dainty diverse chief
pro^^stants of Antwerp, Gaunt* and Bruges were, in admitting him, and how quick
in expelling, so soon as he put them in the least fear of subjection to the
Fren^h.

And as for Port^g^ll, Portugal.
^ h^ve heard some of ^he chiefest Catholics among them say, in this late
contention about their Kingdom: that rather then they would suffer the
Castilian to come in upon them, they would be content to admit whatsoever aids
of a contrary religion to themselves, and to adventure whatsoever alteration in
religion or other inconvenience might bef^ll them ^y that means rather then
endanger their subj^ction to their ambitious neighbor.

The old hatred of East Grecians toward the West Latins.
The like is reported in diverse histories of the Grecians at this day, who do
hate so much ^he name and dominion of the Latins: as they had rather to endure
all the miseries which da^ly they suffer under the Turk for their religion and
othe^wise: then by calling for aid from the West to hazard the subjection to
the said L^tines. So that by these examples you see, that fear and horror of
external subjection may s^ay men in states, and consequently also both Pap^sts
and Puritans in the state of England, from p^ssi^g to the second kind or degree
of treason, albeit they were never so deep in the first, and had both ability,
time, will, and opportunity for the other.

Scholar.
Here I presumed to interrupt their Speech, and said: that this seemed to me
most clear, and that now I understoo^ what the Lawyer meant before, when he
affirmed, that albeit the most part of Papists in general might be said to
deal against the state of England at this day, in that they deal so earnestly
for the maintenance and increase of their religion, and so to incur some kind
of treason: yet (perhap^) not so far-forth nor in so deep a degree of proper
treason ^s in this book is presumed or enforced: Not all Papists prope^ly
traitors.
though for my part (said I) I do not see that the book presumes or inforceth
all Papists in general to be properly traitors, but only such as in
particular are therein named, or that are by law attainted, condemned or
executed: and what will you say (quoth I) to those in particular?

Surely (quoth he) I must say of these, Lawyer.
much after the manner which I sp^ke before: that some here named in this book
are openly known to have been in the second degree or kind of treason: as
Weslme^land, Nor^on, Sanders, The Priests and Seminaries that were executed.
and the like. But diverse others (namely the Priests and Seminaries that of
late have suf^ered,) by so much as I could see delivered and pleaded at their
arraignements, or heard protested by them at their deaths, or gathered by
reason and discourse of my self, (for that no foreign Prince or wise
councellor would ever commit so great matters of state to such instruments:) I
cannot (I s^y) but think, that to the wise of our state, that had the doing of
this business, the first degree of treason (wherein no doubt they were) was
sufficient to d^spatch and make them away: especially in such suspicious times
as these are: to the end that being hanged for the first, they should never be
in danger to fall into the second, nor yet to draw other men to the same: which
pe^haps was most of all misdoubted.

After the Lawyer had sp^ken this, Gentleman.
I held my peace, to hear what the Gentle man would answer: who walked up and
down two whole turns in the Gallery without yielding a^y word again: and then
staying upon the sudden, cast his eyes sadly upon us both, and said:

My masters howsoever this be which indeed appertains not to us to judge or
discus, but rather to persuade our selves, that the state has reason to do as
it does, and that it must oftentimes as well prevent inconveniences, ^s remedy
the same when they are happened: yet for my own part I must confess unto you,
that upon some considerat^ons which use to come unto my mind, I take no s^all
grief of these differences among us (which you term of diverse and different
religions) for which we are driven of necessity to use discipline toward
diverse, who possibly otherwise would be no great malefactors. The
considerations.
I know the cause of this diff^rence is grounded upon a principle not easy to
cure, which is the judgment and conscience of a man, whereunto obeys at
length his will and affection, whatsoever for a time he may otherwise ^issemble
outwardly. I rememb^r your speech b^f^re of the doubtful and dangerous
inclination of such as live discontented in a State of a different religion,
especially, when either in deed, or in their own conceit, they are hardly
dealt withal, and where every man's particular punishment is taken to reach to
the cause of the whole.

I am not ignorant how that misery procures amity, Misery moves mercy.
and the opinion of calamity moves affection of mercy and compassion, even
toward the wicked: the better fortune always is subject to envy, and he that
suffers, is thought to have the better cause; my experience of the diverse
reigns and proceedings of King Edward, Queen Mary, and of this our most
gracious Sovereign has caught me not a little, touching the s^quell of these
affairs. A good w^sh.
And finally (my good friend^) I must tell you plain (quoth he, and this he
spoke with great asseveration) that I could wish with all my heart, that either
these differences were not among us at all, or else that they were so
temperatly on al parts pursued, as the common state of our country, the blessed
reign of her Majesty, and the common cause of true religion were not
endangered thereby. But now: and there he brake off, and turn^^ a^^e.

The L^wyer seeing him hold his peace and depart, Lawyer.
he stepped after him, and taking him by the gown, said merrily; Sir, all men
are not of your complexion, some ^re of quicker and more st^rri^g Spirits, and
do l^ve to fish in water that is troubled, for that they ^oe part^cipate the
Blackmoores humor, The nature and practice of the Gu^n^ans.
that dw^ll in Guinea (whereof I suppose you h^ve heard and seen also some in
this Land) whose ex^rcise at home is (as some write) the one to hunt, catch,
and sell the other, and alway^s ^he stronger to make money of the weak^r for
the time. But now if in E^gland we should live in peace and unity of the state,
as they do in Germ^ny, notwithstanding their differences of Religion, and that
the on^ sh^ul^ not prey upon the other: the^ sh^ul^ the great ^aulcons f^r the
F^eld (I mean the favorites of the time) fail whereon to f^ed, which were an
inconvenienc^ as you kn^w.

Truly Si^ said the G^ntleman, Gentleman.
I th^nke you rove nearer the ma^ke then you wee^e: for if I be not deceived;
the v^^y ground of much of th^se broiles wh^re^f we talk, is but a very p^^y:
not in the minds of the Pr^nc^ or State (whose in^entions no doubt be most j^st
and holy) b^t in the greedy imagi^^tion and su^t^le con^^t of him, who at this
pr^s^nt in r^sp^ct of o^r sinn^s, is p^rmitted by God, to tyran^ize both Prince
and State: and being himself of no religion, feeds notwithstandi^g upon our
differenc^s in ^^ligion, to the fatting of ^ims^lfe and ruin of ^he R^alm. The
T^rant of English sta^e.
For whereas ^y the common d^sti^ct^on now r^ceived in speech, th^re are three
no^^ble differences of religion in the L^nd, ^he two extremes, Three (...) in
E^g^and.
whereof are the Pap^st and ^he Paritan, and the religious Prot^stant o^taining
the mean: this fellow being neither, makes his gain of all: and as he
s^ek^^h a Kingdom by the one extreme, and sp^ile by the other^ so he uses
the authority of the third, to comp^sse the first two, and the cou^ter-mine of
ea^h one, to the overthrow of all thr^e.

(...).
To this I answered: In good sooth Sir, I see now where you are: you are fallen
into the common place of all our ordin^ry ta^ke and confe^^nce in the
Universi^y: The ^ule of ^e^ce^te^.
for I know that you mean my Lord of Le^^^ster, who is the subject of all
pleas^nt discourses at this d^y ^hroughou^ the R^^lme.

Gentl^man.
Not so pleasant as pitiful, answered the Gentl^m^n, if all m^tt^rs and
circums^an^es were well consi^ered, exc^pt any man t^ke pleasure to jest at o^r
own miseries, which are like to be greater by his in^qu^^y (^f God ave^t ^t
not) then by all the ^i^kedn^ss^ ^f England besides: he being the man that by
all prob^bili^y, is like to be the b^ne and f^tall d^stiny of o^r ^tat^, with
the eversion of ^rue r^l^g^on, whereof by indir^ct means, he (...) th^^ the
Lan^ d^^h nour^sh.

Lawy^^.
Now (...) (q^^th the L^wy^^) if you say the (...) for ^he Pro^estants opinion
of him, wh^t shall I (...) for his m^rits toward the Pap^st^* who for as m^^h
^s I c^n perceive, do (...) the^s^l^^s l^^tle b^holding un^o him, albe^^ f^r
h^s ^aine he was some year; their secret fri^n^ ag^i^^t you: until by his
friends he was p^rswa^ed, (...) Lord N^^ths p^^^cy.
and chiefly by the Lord North by way of poli^y, as the said Lord bos^eth, in
hope of g^^ater g^^^e, t^ step ov^r to the Puritans, against us both, whom
notwithstanding it is prob^ble, that he loves as much, as he does the rest.

You know the Bear^s love, said the Gentleman, which is all for his own panch,
Gentleman.
and so this Bearwhelp, turns all to his own commodity, and for greedin^sse
thereof, will overturn all if he be not stopped or muzl^d in time.

And su^ely unto me it is a strange speculation, whereof I cannot pick out the
reason (but only that I do attribute it to Gods punishment for our sins)
that in so wise and vigilant a State as ours is, A strange speculation.
and in a Country ^o well acqu^in^ed and beaten with such dange^s; a man of
such a Spirit a^ he is known to be, of so extr^me ambition, pr^de, falsh^^d
and t^^ch^ry* so borne, so b^ed up, so n^zled in treason from his infancy,
descended of a tribe of traitors, and fl^sh^d in conspiracy against the Roy^ll
blood of King Henry's children in his t^nd^r y^er^s, and ex^rc^s^d ^ver since
in drifts against the same, by the bloo^ and ru^ne of di^^rs others: a man so
well known to bear s^^r^t in (...) against her Majesty, for causes
irreconcil^able, and most dradly rancour against the bent and w^s^st
Co^nc^llours of her H^ghn^sse: that such a o^e (I say so h^^^full) to God and
man, an^ so mark^^ble to the simplest Subject o^ thi^ Land, by the pu^lique
^nsignes of hi^ ^yrannous purpose, should b^ (...) so many ye^res without
ch^^k^, to aspire to tyranny by most manifest w^yes, and to p^^ss^sse him^e^f^
(as now h^ has do^^) (...) Cour^, Cou^c^ll and Cou^^r^y, w^^hout (...): so
that nothing want^^h to him but only h^s pleas^re, and the d^y already
con^eived in his mind to dispose as h^ li^t, both of Prince, Crown, Realm an^
R^ligi^n.

It ^s much truly (quoth I) that you s^y, and it ministr^^h not a little
m^rvaile unto m^^y, S^h^l^r.
whereof your Worship is no^ the first, nor yet the (...) person of account
which I have heard discourse and complain. The Queens Majesty's most excellent
good nature.
But what shall I say hereunto? there is no man that ascribes not this unto
the si^gular benignity and most bountiful good nature of her Majesty, who
measuring other men by her own Heroical and Princely sincerity; cannot easily
suspect a man so much bounden to her grace, as he is, nor remove her confidence
from the place, where she has heaped so infinite benefits.

Gentleman.
No doubt (said the Gentleman) but this gracious and sweet disposition of her
Majesty is the true original c^use thereof: which Princely disposition, as in
her highness it deserves all rare commendation, so lies the same open to
many dangers oftentimes, when so ben^gne a nature meets with ingrate and
amb^ti^us persons: which observation perhaps, c^us^d her M^jesties most noble
Grandfather and Father (two renowned w^se Princ^s) to withdraw sometime upon
the sudden, their great favor from certain S^bjects of high estate. And her
Majesty may e^sily use her own excellent wisdom and memory, to rec^ll to
mind the manifold examples of perilous haps fallen t^ diverse Princes, by too
much confidence in obliged proditours: with whom the name of a Kingdom, and
one hours reig^e, weyeth more, then all the duty, obligation, honesty, Fears
that subject: have of my Lord of Leicester
or nature in the world. Would God her M^j^sty could see the continual fears
that be in he^ faithful Subjects hearts, whiles that man is about her noble
person, so well able and l^k^ly (^f the Lord avert it not) to be the calamity
of her Pri^ely blood and name.

The talk w^ll never out of many mouths an^ minds, Sir Francis Wal^ingham.
that diver^ ancient m^n of this Re^lme and once a wise Gentleman now a
Counc^llour had with a certain friend of his, concerning the presage and deep
impression, which her M^jesties Father had of the house of Sir John Du^^ey, to
be the rain in time of his Maj^sties royal house and blood, which thing was
^^ke to have been fulfilled soon after (as all the world knows) upon the
death of King Edward, by the said Dudley, this man's Father: who at one blow,
procured to disp^tch from a possession from the Crown, all three children of
the said noble King. And yet in the midst of th^se bloody practices against
her Majesty that now is and her sister (wherein also this fellows hand was so
far, as for his age he could thrust the same) within sixteen days before King
Edwards death (he knowing belike that the King should dye) wrote most
flattering letters to the Lady Mary (as I have heard by them who then were with
her) prom^sing all loyalty and true service to her, after the decease of her
brother, Deep dis^imul^tion.
with no l^sse pa^nted words, then this man now does use to Queen Elizabeth.

So deal^ he ^hen with the most dear ch^ldren of his good King and Master, by
whom he had b^ene no l^sse exalted and trusted, then this man is by her
M^j^sty. And so de^ply d^ssembled he then when he had in h^nd the plot to
d^stroy them both. And wh^t then (alas) may not we fear and doubt of thi^ his
son, who in outrageous ambition and desire of reign, is not inf^riour to his
Father or to any o^h^r aspiring spirit in the world, bu^ far more i^s^lent,
c^u^ll* vindi^ative, ^xpert, pote^t, subtle, fi^e and sox I ^e the ^ever he
was? ^ like w^ll the good motion propounded by the foresaid Gentleman to his
fr^end at the same time, (...)
and do assure my self ^t would be most pleasant to the Realm, and
profit^ble to her Majesty, to wit, that this man's actions might be called
publiqu^ly to trial, and liberty given to good subjects to say what they kn^w
against the same, as it was permitted in the first year of Kin^ Henry the eight
against his Grandfather, and in the first of Queen Mary against his Father:
Edmund Dudley
and then I would not doubt, but if these two his Ancestors were found worthy
to lose their heads for treason; Robert Dudley.
this man would not be found unworthy to make the third in kindred, whose
treacheries do far s^^passe them both.

Lawyer.
After the Gentleman h^d sa^d this, ^he Lawy^r stood still, somewhat smiling to
himself, and looking round about him, as though he had bin h^lfe afraid, and
then s^id; My masters, do you read over or study the Statutes that come forth?
have you not heard of the provi^o mad^ in the last Parliament for punishment of
those who speak so broad of such m^n as my Lord of Leic^st^r is?

Gentleman.
Yes, said the Gentleman, I h^ve he^rd how that my Lord of Leic^ster was very
careful and dil^gent at that time to have such a Law to pass against talk^rs:
The Law against talking.
hoping (b^lik^) that his L. under that general restr^i^t might ^ye the more
qui^^ly in harbor from the tempest of men^ to^^^s, which ^a^^ed busily at that

was there no man so simple in ^he R^alm, which descried not this viz^rd at the

and would h^ve stopped mane devises and plots within the Realm: whereas now by
this breach with France, we stand alone as me seems without any great uni^ion
or friendship abroad, and our differences at home grow more vehement and sharp
then ev^r before. Upon which two heads, as also upon infinite other causes,
purpos^s, ^r^f^s and pretenses, there do ensue daily more deep, dangerous and
desperate practices, ev^ry man using either the commod^ty or necessity of the
time and state for his own purpose, ^specially now when all men presume that

marriage) is not like to leave unto the Realm, that precious jewel so much
and long desired of all English h^arts, I mean the Roy^ll heirs of her ^wne

(said the oth^^) truly in my opinion you should have used another word to

by the other.

And for the first th^ee Suitors, he drove them away, Leicesters devices to

by protesting and swe^ring that himself was contracted unto her Majesty,
whereof her highness was sufficiently advertised by Cardin^ll Ch^t^lian in the
first tre^ty for France, and the Cardinal soon after pu^ished (as is thought)
by this man with p^y^on. But yet this speech he g^ve out then, every where
among his friends both strangers and others, that he, forsooth, was assu^ed to
her Majesty, and consequently that all other Princes must give over their
suits, for him. Whereunto notwithstanding, when the Sw^den would hardly give
care, this man conferred wi^h his Privado to make a most unseemly and ^islo^al
proof thereof, for the othe^s satisfaction, which thing I am enforced by duty to
pass over with silence, for honor to the parties who are touched therein: as
also I am to conceal^ his said fil^hy P^ivado, though worthy otherwise for his
dishonesty to be displ^yed to the world: but my Lord himself, I am sure, does
well remember b^th the man and the matter. And albeit there was no wise man at
that time who knowing ^y Lord suspected not the f^ls^hood, and h^s arrogant
^ffirmation touching ^his contract with her Majesty, yet some both ab^oad and
at home might doubt thereof perhaps: Leicester convinced himself of impudency.

and maintained by many for diverse years; yet did the wiser sort make no
account thereof, seeing it came only from himself, and in his own b^h^lfe.
Neither was it credible, that her Majesty who refused so noble Knights and
Princes, as Europe h^th not the like, The baseness of Le^cesters ancestors.
would make choice of so mean a peer as Robin Dudley is, noble only in two

force touching matters of marriage w^thin the Realm.

Oh (said the Gentl^man laughing) you mean for that he procured the poisoning
of her husband in his journ^y from Ireland. Gentleman.
You must think that D^ctor Dale will dispense in that matt^r, Doctor Dale.

or so, I leave it to b^ tried hereafter, between my young Lord of ^enbighe, and
Master Philip Sidney, whom the same most concerns: for that it is lik^ to
deprive him of a goodly inheritance, if it take place (as some will say that in
no reason it can) not only in r^spect of the precedent adultery and murder
between the parties; but also for that my Lord was contracted at least, The

to another Lady before, that yet l^veth, whereof Master Edw^^d Dia^ and M^ster
Edmond Tiney, both Court^ers, can be witnesses, and consumated the same
contract by generation of children. But th^s (as I said) must be left to be
tried hereafter by them who shall have most interest in the case. Only for the
present I must advertise you, that you may not take hold so exactly of all my
L. doings in w^mens affairs, neither touching their marriages, neither yet
their h^sbands.

For first his Lordship has a special fortu^e, that when he d^sireth any
woman's favor, then wh^t person so ev^r stands in his way, has the lu^k to
dye quickly for the finishing of his desire. As for ^xample, The death of
Leicesters first Lady and wife.
when his Lordship was in full hope to marry her Majesty, and his own wife
stood in his light, as he supposed; he did but send her aside to the house of
his servant Forster of Cumner by Oxford, where shortly after she had the chance
to fall from a pair of st^ires, and so to break her neck, but yet without
hurting of her hood that stood upon her head. But Sir Ri^hard Varney, Sir
Richard Varney.
who by commandment rema^ned with her that day alone, with one man only, and
h^d sent away perfor^e all her S^rvants from her, to a Market two miles of, h^
(I s^y) wi^h his man can t^ll how she died, which man being taken afterward for
a felony in the mar^hes of Wales, and offering to publish the manner of the
said murder, was made away privily in the pr^son: and S^r Richar^ himself dying
ab^ut the same time in London, cried pitio^sly and b^a^phemed God, and said to
a Gentleman of worship of mine acqu^intance, not long before his death, that
all the devils in hell did tear him in pieces. The wife also of Bal^ Buttle^

g^ve out the whole fact a litt^e b^fo^e her death B^t to return unto my
purpose, this was my Lords good fortun to have his wife dye, at that time when
it was like to turn most to his profit.

Long after this he f^ll in love with the Lady Sheffi^ld, whom I signified
before, and then also had he the same fortune to have her husband dye quickly
with an extreme rheum in his head (as it was given out) but as others s^y, of
an artificial ca^^rre that stopped his breath. The like good chance had he in
the death of my Lord of Essex (as I have said before) and that ^t a time most
fortunate for hi^ purpose; The suspicious death of the Lord Sheffield.
for when he was coming home from Ireland, with intent to revenge himself upon
my Lord of Leycester, for begetting his wife with ^hilde in his abs^nce (the
child was a dau^hter, and brought up by the Lady Shandoies, W. Knooles his
wif^:) my Lord of Ley hearing thereof, want^d not a friend or two to accomp^ny
the D^puty, as among other, a couple of the Earls own servants, The poisoning
of the Earl of Essex.
Crompton (if I miss not his name) yeoman of his bottles, and Ll^i ^his
Secretary, entertained afterw^rd by my Lord of Lei^ester: and so he dyed in the
way of an extreme flux, caused by an Italian R^^ipe, as all his friends are
well assured; the m^ker whe^^of was a Chy^urgeon (as is bel^eved) that th^n was
newly come to my Lord from Italy: a cunning man, The sh^f^ing of a ch^lde in

and s^re in operation, with whom if the g^od Lady had been sooner acquainted
and ^sed his help, she should not have needed to sitten so pensive at home and
fearful of her husbands former return out of the same Countr^y, but might
have spared the young child in her b^lly, which she was enforced to make away
(cruelly and unnaturally) for clearing the house against the good man's arrival.

Neith^r must you m^rvaile though all these died d^vers manners of outward
diseases, for this is the excellen^y of the I^^lian art, for which this
Chyru^gian and Doctor Iulio were entertained so carefully, The diver^ operation

a man also no^ a little studied (as he seems) in his art: for I heard him
once my self in public Act in Oxford, and that in presence of my Lord of
Leic^ster, (if I be not deceived) maintain, that poison might so be temp^red
and given as i^ should not appe^re presently, and yet should kill the p^rty
af^erward at what time should be appointed. Which a^gument belike pleased well
his Lo^dship, and th^^efore was chosen to be discussed in his audience, if I be
not deceived of h^s being that d^y present. So, though one dye of a flux, and
a^o^her of a catarr^, yet ^his imp^r^eth ^^ttle to the matter, but shew^th
rath^r the great cunning and skill of the Ar^ific^r.

Death of Cardinal Chatilian.
So Cardinal Chatilian (a^ I h^ve sai^ before) having accused my Lord of
Leicester to the Q^eens Majesty, and after that, p^ssi^g from Lon^on toward
France about the marriage, died by the way at Canterbury of a burning fever:
and so proved Doctor Bay^ie^ asser^ion ^rue, that poison may be given to kill
at a day.

Sch^l^r.
At this the Lawyer cast up his eyes to heaven, and I stood somewhat musing and
thinking of that which had been spoken of the Earl of Essex, whose case
indeed moved me more then all the rest, for that he was ^ very noble.
Gentleman, a great advancer of true Religion, a P^tron to many Preachers an^
Students, and toward me and some of my friends in p^r^icular, he had b^ene in
some things very ben^ficiall: and therefore I said that it grieved me extremely
to hear or think of so unworthy a death contrived by such means to so worthy
a Peer. And so much the more, for that it was my chance, to come to the
understanding of diverse particulars concerning that thing, both from one Lea an
Irishman, Lea. Honnie^.
Robin ^onnies, and others, that were present at Pentereis the Merchants house
in Dublin upon the Key, where the murder was committed. The matter was wrought
especially by Crompton yeoman of the bottels, by the procurement of Lloyd as
you have noted before, and there was poisoned at the same time, and with the
same cup (a^ given of courtesy by the Earl) one Mistress Al^s Draykot, a
goodly Gentlewoman, Mistress Draykot poisoned with the Earl of Ess^x
whom the Earl affectioned much, who departing thence toward her own house,
(which was 18. miles off, the foresaid Lea accompanying her, and waiting upon
her) she began to fall sick very grievously* upon the way, and continued with
increase of paine^ and excessive torments, by vomiting, until she died, which
was the Sunday before the Earls death, ensuing the Friday after; and when she
was dead, her body was swollen unto a monstrous bigness and deformity, whereof
the good Earl hearing the day following* lamented the case greatly, and said
in the presence of his Servants, Ah poor Alice, the cup was not prepared for
thee, albeit it were thy hard destiny to taste thereof.

Young Honnies also, whose father is Master of the ch^ldren of her M^jesties
chapel, being at that time Page to the said Earl, and accustomed to take the
taste of his drink (though since entert^ined also among other by my Lord of
Leicester, for better covering of matter) by his taste that he then took of
the compound cup, (though in very small-quantity, as you know the fashion is:)
yet was he like to have lost his life, but escaped in the end (being young) with
the loss only of his hair; which the Earl perceiving, and taking compassion
of the youth, called for a cup of drink a little before his death, The Earl
of Essex speech to his Page Robin Honnie^.
and drunk to Honnies, saying, I drink to thee my Robin, and be not afraid,
for thi^ is a better cup of drink then that whereof thou tookest the taste
when we were both poisoned, and whereby thou have lost thy hair and I must
lose my life. This has young Honnies reported openly in diverse places, and
before diverse Gentlemen of worship si^hence his coming into England; and the
foresaid Lea I^ishman, at his passage this way toward France, after he had
been present at the forenamed Mistress Drayk^ts death, with some other of the
Ea^les servants, have and do most constantly report the same, where they may
do it without the terror of my Lord of Leicesters revenge. Wh^refore in this
matter there is no doubt at all, though most extreme vile and intolerable
indignity, that such a man should be so openly murdered without punishment.
What Nobleman within the Realm may be safe, if this be suffered? or what
worthy personage will adventure his life in her Majesty's service, if this
shall be his reward? But, Sir, I pray you pardon me, for I am somewhat perhaps
too vehement in the case of this my Patron and noble Peer of our Realm. And
therefore I beseech you to go forward in your talk whereas you left.

Gen^leman.
I was recounting unto you others (said the Gentleman) made away by my Lord of
Leic^ster with like art, and the next in order I think was Sir Nicelas
Throgmarton, Death of Sir Nicholas Throgmarton.
who was a man whom my Lord of Leicester used a great while (as all the World
knows) to overthwart and cross the doings of my Lord Treasurer then Sir
William Cicill, Sir William Cicill now Lord Treasurer.
a man specially misliked always of Leicester, both in respect of his old
Master the Duke of Somerset, as also for that his great wisdom, zeal and
singular fidelity to the Realm, was like to hinder much this man's designments;
wherefore understanding after a certain time that these two Knights were
secretly made friends, and that Sir Nicholas was l^ke to detect his doings (as
he imagined) which might turn to some prejudice of his purposes: (having
conceived also a s^cret grudge and grief against him, for that he had written
to her Majesty at his being Ambassador in France, that he heard reported at
Duke Memorances table, that the Queen of England had a meaning to marry her
Hors^keeper) he invited the said Sir Nicholas to a supper at his house in
London, and at supper time departed to the Court, being called for, as he said,
upon the sudden by her Majesty, and so perforce would needs have Sir Nicholas
to sit and occupy his Lordships place, and therein to be served as he was: and
soon after by a surfeit there taken, he died of a strange and incurable vomit.
But the day before his death, he declared to a dear friend of his, The
poisoning of Sir Nicholas in a salet.
all the circumstance and cause of his disease, which he affirmed plainly to be
of poison, given him in a Salet at supper, inveying most earnestly against the
Earls cru^lty and bloody disposition, affirming him to be the wickedest, most
perilous, and pe^fidious man under heaven. But what availed this, when he had
now received the bait?

This then is to show the man's good fortune, in seeing them dead, whom for
causes he would not have to live. And for his art of poisoning, it is such now,
and tea^heth so far, as he holds all his foes in England and elsewhere, as
also a good many of his friends in fear thereof, and if it were known how many
he h^th dispatched or assaulted that way, it would be marvailous to the
posterity. The late Eale of Sussex wanted not a scruple for many years before
his death, The Lord Chamberlin.
of some dram received, that made him incurable. And unto that noble Gentleman
Monsieur Simiers, Monsieur Simiers
it was discovered by great providence of God, that his life was to be
attempted by that art, and that not taking place (as it did not through his
own good circumspection,) it was concluded that the same should be ass^ulted
by violence, whereof I shall have occasion to say more hereafter.

It ha^h been told me also by some of the servants of the late Lady Lenox, who
was also of the blood Royal by Scotland, The poisoning of the Lady Lenox.
as all men know, and consequently l^ttle liked by Leicester; that a little
before her death or si^knesse, my Lord took the pains to come and visit her
with extraordinary kindness, at her house at Hackney, bestowing long
discourses with her in private: but as soon as he was departed, the good Lady
fell into such a fl^x, as by no means could be slayed so long as she had life
in her body; whereupon both she her self, and all such as were near about
her, saw her disease and ending day, were fully of opinion, that my Lord had
procured her dispatch at his being there. Whereof let the women that served her
be examined, as also Fowler that then had the chief doings in her aff^i^es,
and since has been entertained by my Lord of Leicester. Ma^et also, a
stranger borne, tbat then was about her, a sober and zealous man in religion,
and otherwise well qualified, can say somewhat in this point (as I think) if
he were demanded. So that this art and exercise of poisoning, is much more
perfect with my Lord then praying, and he seems to take more pleasure therein.

Now for the second point, which I named, touching marriages and contracts with
Women: you must not marvel though his Lordship be somewhat diverse, Leicesters
most variable dealing with women in contract^ and marriages.
variable and inconstant with himself, for that according to his profit or
pleasure, and as his lust and liking shall vary (wherein by the judgment of
all men, he surpasses, not only Sard^napa^us and Nero, ^ut even Heliog^batus
himself:) so his Lordsh^p also changes W^ves and Minions, by killing the one,
denying the other, using the third for a time, and he fawning upon the fourth.
And for this c^use he has his terms and pretenses (I warrant you) of
Contracts, Precontracts, Postcontracts, Protracts and Retracts; as for example:
after he had killed his first w^fe, and so broken that contract, Contracts.
then forsooth would he needs make himself Husband to the Queens Majesty, and
so defeat all other Princes by virtue of his precontract. Precontracts.
But after th^s, his lust comp^lling to another place, Postcontracts.
he would needs make a postcontract with the Lady Sheffi^ld, and so he did,
begetting two children upon her, the one a boy called Robin Sheffi^ld now
living, some time brought up at Newington; and the other a daughter, borne (as
is known) at Dudley Castle. But yet after, his concupiscence changed again
(as it never stays) he resolved to make a retract of this postcon^r^ct,
Retract.
(th^ugh ^t were as surely done (as I have said) as bed and Bible could make
the same) and to make a certain new protract, Protract.
(which is a continuation of using her for a time) with the widow of Essex: but
yet to stop the mou^hes of out-criars, and to bury the Synagogue with some
honor, Leicesters two testaments.
(for these two wives of Leicester were merrily and wittily called his old and
new Testaments, by a person of great excellency within the Realm) he was
content to assign to the former a thousand pounds in money with other petty
consideratio^s, (the pittifullest abused that ^ver was poor Lady) and so
betake his lims to the latter, which latter notwithstanding, he so uses (as we
see) now confessing, now forswearing, now dissembling the marriage; as he will
always yet ke^p^ a void place for a new surcontract with any other, when
occasion shall require.

Now by my truth sir (quoth I) I never heard nor read the like to this in my
life; Scholar.
yet have I read much in my time, of the carnal^ty and licenciousnesse of
diverse outrageous persons, in this kind of sin, as namely these whom you have
mentioned before; especially the Emperor Heliogabalu^ who passed all other,
Varius Heliogabalus, and his most infamous death.
and was called Varius, of the varity of filth which he used in this kind of
carnality or carnal beastliness: whose death was, that being at length odious
to all men, and so slain by his own Soldiers, was drawn through the City upon
the ground l^ke a dog, and cast into the common privy, with this Epitaph; Hic
projectus est indomitae and rabide libidinis catulus. An Epitaph.
Here is thrown in the Whelpe of unruly and raging lust: which Epitaph may also
one day chance to serve my Lord of Leicester (whom you call the Bearewhelp) if
he go forward as he has begun, and dye as he deserves.

But, good sir, what a compassion is this, that among us Christians, and namely
in so well governed and religious a Commonwealth as ours is, A pitiful
permission.
such a riot should be permitted upon men's wives, in a subject? whereas we read
that among the very Heathens, less offenses then these, in the same kind,
were extremely pun^shed in Princes themselves, and that not only in the person
delinquent alone, but also by extirpation of the whole family for his sake, The
ex^erpation of the Tarquinions.

Anno Dom. 959.


as appears in the example of the Tarquinians among the Romans. And here also
in our own Realm, we have registered in Chronicle, how that one King Edwin
above six hundred years past, was deprived of his Kingdom, for much less
scandalous facts then these.

I remember well the story (quoth the Gentleman) and thereby do easily make
conjecture, Gentleman.
what difference there is betwixt those times of old, and our days now: seeing
then, a crowned Prince could not pass unpunished with one or two outrageous
acts, whereas now a subject raised up but yesterday from the meaner sort, The
intolerable l^cenciousnes of Leicesters carnality.
rangeth at his pleasure in all licenciousnesse, and that with security, void
of fear both of God and man. No man's wife can be free from him, whom his fiery
lust likes to abuse, nor their husbands able to resist nor save from his
violence, if they show dislike, or will not yield their consent to his doings.
And if I should discover in particular how many good husbands he had plagued in
this nature, and for such delights, it were intolerable; for his concupiscence
and violence do run jointly together, as in furious beasts we see they are
accustomed. Neither holds he any rule in his lust besides only the motion
and suggestion of his own sensuality; kindred, affinity or any other b^nd of
consanguinity; religion, honor or honesty takes no place in his outrageous
appetite: what he best likes, that he takes as lawful for the time. So that
kinswoman, allie, friends wife or daughter, or whatsoever female sort besides
does please his eye: (I leave out of purpose, and for honor sake, terms of
kindred more near) that must yield to his desire.

The keeping of the Mother with two or three of her daughters at once or
successively, is no more with him, then the eating of an Hen and her chicken
together. There are not (by report) two noble women about her Majesty (I speak
upon some account of them that know much) whom he has not solicited by potent
ways: neither contented with this place of honor, he has descended to seek
pasture among the waiti^g Gentlewomen of her Maj^sties great chamber, offering
more for their allurement, Money well spent
then I think Lais did commonly tak^ in Corinth, if three hundredth pounds for
a night, will make up the sum; or if not, yet will he make it up otherwise:
having reported himself (so little shame he has) that he offered to another
of higher place, an 100 pound lands by the year, with as many jewels as most
women under her Majesty used in England; Anne Vauisour.
which was no mean bait to one that used traffic in such merchandise; she
being but the leavings of anoth^r man before him, whereof my Lord is nothing
squemish, for satisfying of his lust, but can be content (as they s^y) to
gather up crumbs when he is hungry, even in the very Landry it self, or other
place of baser quality.

And albeit the Lord of his great mercy, to do him good, The punishments of
God upon Leicester to do him good.
no doubt, if he were revokeable, has laid his hand upon him, in some
chastisement in this world, by giving him a broken belly on both sides of his
bowels, whereby misery and putrefaction is threatened to him daily: and to his
young Son, by the widow of Essex (being Filius peccati) such a strange
calamity of the falling sickness in his infancy, The children of adulterers
shall be consumed, and the seed of a wicked bed shall be rooted out, says God,
Sap. 3.
as well may be a witness of the Parents sin and wickedness, and of both
their wasted natures in iniquity: yet is this man nothing amended thereby, but
according to the custom of all old adulterers, is more libidinous at this day
then ever before, more given to procure love in others by conjuring, sorcery,
and other such means. And albeit for himself, both age, and nature spent, do
somewhat tame him from the act, yet wants he not will, as appears by the
Italian ointment, procured not many years p^st by his Chyrurgion or Mountibanke
of that Country, Leicesters ointment.
whereby (as they say) he is able to move his flesh at all times, for keeking
of his credit, howsoever his inability be otherwise for performance: as also
one of his Physicians reported to an Earl of this Land, that his Lordship had
a bottle for his bed-head, Leicesters bottle
of ten pounds the Pint to the same effect. But my Masters whether are we
fallen, unadvisedly? I am ashamed to have made mention of so base filthiness.

Not without good cause (quoth I) but that we are here alone, and no man
hears us. Scholar.
Wherefore I pray you let us return whereas we left: and when you named my
Lord of Leicesters Daughter borne of the Lady Sh^ffield in Dudley Castle, there
came into my head a pretty story concerning that affair: which now I will
recount (though somewhat out of order) thereby to draw you from the further
stirring of this unsavory puddle and foul dunghill, whereunto we are sl^pped,
by following my Lord somewhat too far in his paths and actions.

Wherefore to tell you the tale as it fell out: I gr^w acquainted three months
past with a certain Minister, that now is dead, and was the same man that was
used in Dudley Castle, for complement of some sacred ceremonies at the birth of
my Lord of Leicesters daughter in that place: and the matter was so ordained, A
pretty device.
by the wily wit of him that had sowed the seed, that for the better covering
of the harvest and secret delivery of the Lady Sheffield, the good wife of the
Castle also (whereby Leicesters appointed gossips might without other suspicion
have access to the place) should feign her self to be with child, and after
long and sore travel, God wot, to be delivered of a cushion (as she was
indeed) and a little after a fair coffin was buried with a bundell of clouts,
in show of a child; and the Minister caused to use all accustomed prayers and
ceremonies for the solemn interring thereof: An act of atheism
for which thing afterward, before his death, he had great grief and remorse
of conscience, with no small detestation of the most irreligious device of my
Lord of Leicester in such a case.

Here the Lawyer began to laugh a pace both at the device and at the Minister;
Lawyer.
and said, now truly if my Lords contracts hold no better, but has so many
infirmities, with subtilties, and byplaces besides: I would be loath that he
were married to my daughter, as mean as she is.

But yet (quoth the Gentleman) I had rather of the two be his wife, Gentleman.
for the time, then his guest: especially if the Italian Chyrurgian or
Physician be at hand.

True it is (said the Lawyer) for he does no^ poison his wives, Lawyer.
whereof I somewhat mervaile, especially his first wife; I muse why he chose
rather to make her away by open violence, then by some Italian confortive.

Gentleman.
Hereof (said the Gentleman) may be diver^ reasons alleged. First, The first
reason why Leicester slew his wife by violence, rather then by poison.
that he was not at that time so skillful in those Italian wares, nor had about
him so fit Physicians and Chyrurgions for the purpose: nor yet in truth do I
think that his mind was so settled then in mischief, as it has been
sithence. For you know, that men are not desperate the first day, but do enter
into wickedness by degrees, and with some doubt or staggering of conscience at
the beginning. And so he at that time might be desirous to have his wife made
away, for that she let him in his designements, but yet not so stony-h^rted
as to appoint out the particular manner of her death, but rather to leave that
to the discretion of the murderer.

Secondly, The second reason.
it is not also unlike that he prescribed unto Sir Richard Varney at his going
thither, that he should first attempt to kill her by poison, and if that took
not place, then by any other way to dispatch her howsoever. This I prove by the
report of old Doctor Bailey, who then lived in Oxford (another manner of man
then he who now lives about my Lord of the same name) and was Professor of
the Physic Lecture in the same University. Doctor Bailey the elder.
This learned grave man reported for most certain, that there was a practice
in Cumner among the conspiratours, to have poisoned the poo^e Lady a little
before she was killed, which was attempted in this oder.

They seeing the good Lady sad and heavy (as one that well knew by her other
handling that her death was not far off) began to perswde her, that her disease
was abundance of melancholy and other humors, and therefore would needs
counsel her to take some potion, which she absolutely refusing to do, as
suspecting still the worst; they sent one day, (unwares to her) for Doctor
Bailey, and desired him to persuade her to take some little potion at his hands,
A practice for poisoning the Lady Dudley.
and they would send to fetch the same at Oxford upon his prescription, meaning
to have added also somewhat of their own for her comfort, as the Doctor upon
just causes suspected, seeing their great importunity, and ^he small need which
the good Lady had of Physic; and therefore he flatly denied their request,
misdoubting (as he after reported) lest if they had poisoned her under the name
of his Potion. he might after have been hanged for a color of their sin.
Marry the said Doctor remained w^ll assured that this way t^king no place, she
should not long escape violence, as after ensued. And ^he thing was so beaten
into the heads of the principal men of the University of Oxford, by these and
other means: as for that she was found murdered (as all men said) by the
Crowners inquest, and for that she being hastily and obscurely buried at Cumner
(which was condemned above, as not advisedly done) my good Lord, to make plain
to the world the great love he bare to her in her life, and what a grief the
loss of so virtuous a Lady was to his tender heart, would needs have her taken
up again and reburied in the University Church at Oxford, with great pomp and
solemnity: that Doctor Babington my Lords Chaplain, Doct. Babington
making the public funeral Sermon at her second burial, tript once or twice
in his speech by recommending to their memories that virtuous Lady so pitifully
murdered, instead of so pitifully slain.

A third reason.
A third cause of this manner of the Ladies death, may be the disposition of my
Lords nature; which is bold and violent where it fears no resistance (as all
cowardly natures are by kind) and where any difficulty or danger appears,
there, more ready to attempt all by art, subtilty, treason and treachery. And
so for that he doub^ed no great resistance in the poor Lady to withstand the
hands of them which should offer to break her neck: he durst the bolder attempt
the same openly.

But in the men whom he poisoned, for that they were such valiant Knights, the
most part of them, as he durst as soon have eaten his scabard, as draw his
sword in public against them: he was enforced (as all wretched irefull and
dastardly crea^ures are) to supplant them by fraud, and by other men's hands. As
also at other times, he has sought to do unto diverse other noble and valiant
personages, when he was afraid to meet them in the field, as a Knight should
have done.

His treacheries toward the noble late Earl of Sussex in their many breaches,
is notorious ^o all England. As also the bloody practices against diverse others.

But as among many none were more odious and misliked of all men, then those
against Monsieur Simiers, a stranger and Ambassador; whom first he practiced
to have poisoned (as has bin touched before) and when that device took not
place, The intended murder of Monsieur Simiers by sundry means.
then he appointed that Robin Tider his man) as after upon his Ale-bench he
confessed) should have slain him at the Blackfriars at Greenwich as he went
for^h at the garden gate; but missing also that purpose, for that he found the
Gentleman better provided and guarded then he expected, he dealt with certain
Flushi^ers and other Pirates to sink him at Sea, with the English Gentlemen
his favorers, that accompanied him at his return into France. And though they
missed of this practice also, (as not daring to set upon him for fear of some
of her Majesty's ships, who to break off this designment attended by special
commandment, to waft him over in safety) yet the foresaid English Gentlemen
were holden four hours in chase at their coming back, as Master Rawley well
knows, being then present, and two of the chasers, nam^d Clark and Harris,
confessed afterward the whole designment.

The intended murder of the Earl of Ormond
The Earl of Ormond in likewise has often declared, and will avouch it to my
Lord of Leicesters face, whenever he shall be called to the same, that at
such time as this man had a quarrel with him, and thereby was likely to be
enforced to the field (which he trembled to think of) he first sought by all
means to get him made away by secret murder, offering five hundred pounds for
the doing thereof. And secondly, when that device took no place, he appointed
with him the field, but secretly suborning his servant William Killigre to lie
in the way where Ormond should pass, William Killegre
and so to massacre him with a caliver, before he came to the place appointed.
Which murder, though it took no effect, for that the matter was taken up,
before the day of meeting: yet was Killigre placed afterward in her Majesty's
privy Chamber by Leicester, for showing his ready mind to do for his Master
so faithful a service.

Scholar.
So faithful a service (quoth I) truly, in my opinion, it was but an unfit
preferment, for so facinorous a fact. And as I would be loath tha^ many of his
Italians, or other of that art, should come nigh about her Majesty's kitchen;
so, much less would I, that many such his bloody Champions, should be placed
by him in her Highness chamber. Albeit for this Gentleman in particular, it
may be, that with change of his place in service, he has changed also his
mind and affection, and received better instruction in the fear of the Lord.

But yet in general, I must needs say, that it cannot be but prejudicial and
exceeding dangerous unto our noble Prince and Realm, that any one man
whatsoever (especially such a one as the world takes this man to be) should
grow to so absolute authority and commandry in the Court, as to place about the
Princes person (the head, the heart, Preoccupation of her Majesty's person.
the life of the land) whatsoever people likes him best, and that now upon
their deserts toward the Prince, but toward himself; whose fidelity being
more obliged to their advancer, then to their sovereign, do serve for
watchmen about the same, for the profit of him, by whose appointment they were
placed. Who by their means casting indeed but nets and chains, and invisible
bands about that person, whom most of all he pretends to serve, he shuts
up his Prince in a prison most sure, though sweet and senseless.

Neither is this art of aspiring new or strange unto any man that is
experienced in affair^s of former time; An ordinary way of aspiring by
preoccupation of the Princes person.
for that it has been from the beginning of all government a trodden path of
all aspirers. In the stories both sacred and profane, foraine and domestical
of all Nations, Kingdoms, Countries and States, you shall read, that such as
meant to mount above others, and to govern all at their own discretion; did
lay this for the first ground and principle of their purpose; A comparison.
to possess themselves of all such as were in place about the principal; even
as he who intending to hold a great City at his own disposition, dares not
make open war against the same; gets secretly into his hands or at his
devotion, all the Towns, Villages, Castles, Fortresses, bulwarks, Rampires,
Waters, Ways, Ports and Passages, about the same, and so without drawing any
sword against the said City, he brings the same into bondage to abide his
will and pleasure.

This did all these in the Roman Empire, who rose from subjects to be great
Princes, and to put down Emperors. This did all those in France and other
Kingdoms, who at sundry times have tyrannized their Princes. And in our own
Country the examples are manifest of Vortiger, Harold, Henry of Lancaster,
Richard of Warwick, Richard of Gloucester, John of Northumberland, and diverse
others, who by this mean specially, have pulled down their lawful
Sovereigns.

And to speak only a word or two of the last, for that he was this man's
Father; does not all England know, The way of aspiring in Duke Dudley.
that he first overthrew the good Duke of Somerset, by drawing to his devotion
the very servants and friends of the said Duke? And afte^ward did not he
possess himself of the Kings own person, and brought him to the end which is
known, and before that, to the most shameful disheriting of his own royal
Sisters: and all this, by possessing first the principal men, that were in
authority about him?

Wherefore sir, if my Lord of Leicester have the same plot in his head (as most
men think) and that he means one day to give the same push at the Crown by
the House of Huntington, against all the race and line of King Henry the
seventh in general, which his Father gave before him, by pretense of the House
of Suffolk, against the Children of King Henry the eight in particular; he
wants not reason to follow the same means and platform of planting special
persons for his purpose about the Prince, for surely his fathers plot lacked no
witty device or preparation, but only that God overthrew it at the instant:
(as happily he may do this man's) also notwithstanding any diligence that
humane wisdom can use to the contrary.

To this said the Gentleman: Gentleman.
that my Lord of Leycester has a purpose to shoot one day at the Diadem by the
title of Huntington, is not a thing obscure in it self, and it shall be more
plainly proved hereafter. But now will I show unto you for your instruction,
how well this man has followed his fathers platform (or rather passed the
same) in possessing himsel^e of all her Majesty's servants, friends, and
forces, to serve his turn at that time for execution, and in the mean space
for preparation.

First, in the privy Chamber, Leycesters power in the privy Chamber.
next unto her Majesty's person, the most part are his own creatures (as he
calls them) that is, such as acknowledge their being in that place, from him:
and the rest he so over-ruleth, either by flattery or fear, as none may dare
but to serve his turn. As his reign is so absolute in this place, (as also in
all other parts of the Court) as nothing can pass but by his admission,
nothing can be said, done, or signified, whereof he is not particularly
advertised: no bill, no supplication, no complaint, no suit, no speech, can
p^sse from any man to the Princess (except it be from one of the Council) but
by his good liking: or if there do, he being admonished thereof (as presently
he shall,) the party delinquent is sure after to abide the smart thereof.
Whereby he holds as it were a lock upon the ears of his Prince, and the
tongues of all her Majest^es servants, so surely chained to his girdle, as no
man dares to speak any one thing that may offend him, though it be never so
true or behovefull for her Majesty to know.

As well appeared in the late marriage with Dame Essex, Leycester married at
Waenstead: when her Majesty was at M. Stoners Houf Doctor Culpeper Physician
Minister.
which albeit it was celebrated twice: first at Killingworth, and secondly at
Waenstead (in the presence of the Earl of Warwick, Lord No^th, Sir Francis
Knooles, and others) and this exactly known to the whole Court, with the very
day, the place, the witnesses, and the Minister that married them together: yet
no man durst open his mouth to make her Majesty privy thereunto, until Monsieur
Simiers disclosed the same, (and thereby incurred his high displeasure) nor yet
in many days after for fear of Lycester. Which is a subjection most
dishonorable and dangerous to any Prince living, to stand at the devotion of
his subject, what to hear or not to hear of things that pass within his own
Realm.

No suit can pass but by Leycester.
And hereof it follows that no suit can prevail in Court, be it never so
mean, except he first be made acquainted there with, and receive not only the
thanks, but also be admitted unto a great part of the gain and commodity
thereof. Read Polidore in the 7. year of King Richard 1. and you shall find
this proceeding of certain about that K. to be put as a great cause of his
overthrow.
Which, as it is a great injury to the suter: so is it a far more greater to
the bounty, honor and security of the Prince, by whose liberality this man
feeds only, and fortifieth himself, depriving his sovereign of all grace,
thanks and good will for the same. For which cause also he gives out
ordinarily, to every suter, that her Majesty is nigh and persimoniou^ of her
self, and very difficile to grant any suit, were it not only upon his
incessant solicitation. Whereby he fills his own purse the more, and emptieth
the hearts of such as receive benefit, from due thanks to their Princes for
the suit obtained.

Hereof also ensues, that no man may be preferred in Court (be he otherwise
never so well a deserving servant to her Majesty) except he be one of
Leycesters faction or followers: none can be advanced, except he be liked and
preferred by him: none receive grace, No preferments but by Leycester to
Leycest^ians.
except he stand in his good favor, no one may live in coun^enance, or quiet
of life, excep^ he take it, use it, acknowledge it from him, so as all the
favors, graces, dignities, riches and rewards, which her Majesty bestows, or
the Realm can yield, must serv^ to purchase this man private friends, and
favorers, only to advance his party, and to fortify his faction. Which
faction if by these means it be great, (so as indeed it is:) you may not
marvile, seeing the riches and wealth, of so worthy a Common weal, do serve
him but for a price to buy the same.

Which thing himself well knowing, frames his spirit of proceeding
accordingly. And first, Leycesters anger and insolency.
upon confidence thereof, is become so insolent and impotent of his Ire that no
man may bear the same, how justly or inj^stly soever it be conceived: for
albeit he begin to h^te a man upon bare surmises only (as commonly it falls
out, ambition being alway^s the mother of suspicion) yet he presecuteth the
same with such implacable cruelty, as there is no long abiding for the party in
^h^t place. As mi^ht be showed by the examples of many whom he has chased
from the Court, upon his only displeasure, without other cause, being known to
be otherwise, zealous Protestant. As Sir Jerome B^wes, Mr. Geo^ge Scot, and
others that we could name.

To ^h^s insolency is also joined (as by nature it follows) m^st absolute and
peremptory de^ling in all things whereof it pleases him to dispose, Leycesters
peremptory dealing.
without respect either of reason, order, due, right, subordination, custom,
convenience, or the like: whereof notwithstanding Princes themselves are wont
to have regard in disposition of their matters: as for example, among the
servants of the Queens M^jesti^s household, it is an ancient and most
commendable order and custom, that when a place of higher room falls void,
he that by succession is next, and has made proof of his worthiness in an
inferior place, should rise and possess the same, (except it be for some
extraordinary cause) to the end that no man unexperienced or unt^yed, should be
placed in the higher rooms the first day, to the prejudice of others, and
disservice of the Prince.

Breaking of order in her Majesty's household.
Which most reasonable custom this man contemning and breaking at his pleasure,
thrusts into higher rooms any person whatsoever, so he like his inclination,
or feel his reward: albeit he neither be fit for the purpose, nor have been
so much as Clarke in any in^^^iour office before.

The like he uses out of the Court, in all other places where matters should
pass by order, Leycesters violat^ng of all order in the Country abroad.
election, or degree: as in the Universities, in election of Sch^lars, and
Heads of houses, in Ecclesiastical persons, for dignities in Church, in
Officers, Magistrates, Stew^rds of lands, Sheriffs and knights of Shires, in
Burgesses of the Parliament, in Commissi^ners, Judges, Justices of the peace,
(whereof many in every shire must wear his livery) and all other the like:
where this man's will must stand for reason, and his letters for absolute laws,
neither is there any man, magistrate, or communer in the Realm, who dares not
sooner deny their petition of her Majesty's letters, upon just causes (for that
her highness is content after to be satisfied with reason) then to resist the
commandment of this man's letters, who will admit no excuse or satisfaction,
but only the execution of his said commandment, be it right or wrong.

To this answered the Lawyer, Now verily, sir, Lawyer.
you paint unto me a strange pattern of a perfect Potentate in the Court:
belike that stranger, who calls our State in his printed book Leycestren sem
Rempublicam, a Leycestrian Commonwealth, A Leycestrian Commonwealth
or the Commonwealth of my Lord of Leycester, knows much of these matters.
But to hold, si^, still within the Court: I assure you that by considerations,
which you have laid down, I do begin now to perceive that his party must
needs be very great and strong within the said Court, seeing that he has so
many ways and means to increase, enrich, and encourage the same, and so
strong abilities to tread dow^e his enemies. The common speech of many wants
not reason, I perceive, which calls him the heart and life of the Court.

They which call him the heart (said the Gentleman) upon a little occasion more,
Gentleman. Leycester called the heart and life of the Count.
would call him also the head: and then I marvel what should be left for her
Majesty, when they take from her both life, heart, and headship in her own
Realm? But the truth is, that he has the Court at this day in almost the same
case as his father had it in King Edwards d^y^s, by the same device, (the Lord
forbid that ever it come fully to the same state, for then we know what ensued
to the principal:) and if you will h^ve an evident demonstration of this man's
power and fav^ur in that place, call you but to mind the times when her
Majesty upon most just and urgent occ^sions, did withdraw but a little her
wonted favor and countenance tow^rds him: did not all the Court as it were,
mutiny presently? did not every man hang the lip? A demonstration of
Leyceste^s tyranny in the Court.
except a few, who afterward paid sweetly for their mirth; were there not every
day new devices sought out, that some should be on their knees to her Majesty,
some should weep and put finger in their eyes: other should find our certain
covert manner of threatening: other reasons and persuasions of love: other of
profit: other of honor: other of n^^essity: and all to get him recalled back
to favor again? And had her Majesty any rest permitted unto her, until she
had yielded and granted to the same?

Consider then (I pray you) that if at that time, in his disgrace, he had his
faction so fast assured to himself: what has he now in his prosperity, after
so many years of fortification? wherein by all reason he has not been
negligent, Leycester provideth never to come in the Q^e^nes danger again.
seeing that in policy the first point of good fortification is, to make that
fort impregnable, which once has been in danger to be lost. Whereof you have an
example in Ri^har^ Duke of York, in the time of K. Henry the sixth, who being
once in the Kings hands by his own submission, and dismissed again (when for
his des^rts, he should have suffered) provided after, the King should never be
able to overreach him the second time, or have him in his power to do him
hurt, but m^de himself strong enough to pull down the other wi^h extirpation
of his family. Anno Regni 3^.


And this of the Court, household and Chamber of her Majesty. But now if we
shall pass from Count to Council, we shall find him no less fortified but
rather more: Ley^esters puissance in the privy Council.
for albeit the providence of God has bin such, that in this most honorable
assembly, there has not wanted some two or three of the wisest, grav^st, and
most experienced in our state, that have seen and marked this man's perilous
proceedings from the beginning, (whereof notwithstanding two are now deceased,
L, Keeper. L. Chamberlain.
and their place^ supplied to Leyce^ters good liking:) yet (alas) the wisdom of
these worthy men, has discovered always more, then their authorities were
able to redress: (the others great power and violence considered) and for the
residue of that bench and table, though I doubt not but there be diverse, who do
in heart detest his doing^ (as there were also, no doubt among the Councillors
of King Edward, who misliketh this man's fathers attempts, though not so hardy
as to contrary the same:) yet for most part of the Council present, they are
known to be so affected in particular, the one for that he is to him a Brother,
the other a Father, the other a Kinsman, the other an allie, the other a fast
obliged friend, the other a fellow or follower in faction, as none will stand
in the breach against him: none dare resist or encounter his designeme^t: but
every man yielding rather to the force of his flow, permits him to pierce,
and pass at his pleasure in whatsoever his will is once settled to obtain.

And hereof (were I not stayed for respect of some whom I may not name) I could
allege strange examples, not so much in affairs belonging to subjects and to
private men, Matters wherein the Council are enforced to wink at Leycester.
as (were the cause of Snowden forest, Denbigh of Kil^ingworth, of his fair
P^stures foully procured by Southam, of the Archb^sh. of Canterbury, of the L.
Ba^kley, of Sir John Throgmarton, of M. Rob^nson and the like;) wherein those of
the Council that disliked his doings, least d^red to oppose themselves to the
same, but also in things that appertain directly to the Crown and dignity, to
the State and Commonweal, and to the safety and continuance thereof. It is not
secure for any one Councellor, or other of authority, to take notice of my
Lords errors or misdeeds, but with extreme peril of their own ruin.

Leycesters intelligence with the rebellion in Ireland.
As for example: in the beginning of the rebellion in Ireland, when my Lord of
Leycester was in some disgrace, and consequently, as he im^gined, but in
frail state at home, he thought it not unexpedient, for his better assurance,
to hold some intelligence also that way, for all events, and so he did: whereof
there was so good evidence and testimony found, upon one of the first of
account, that was there slain, (as honorable personages of their knowledge
have assured me) as would have been sufficient, to touch the life of any
subject in the land, or in any state Christian, but only my Lord of Leycester,
who is a subject without subj^ction.

For what think you? durst any man take notice hereof, or avouch that he had
seen thus much? durst he that took it in Ireland, deliver the same where
especially he should have done? or they who received it in England, for it
came to great hands, use it to the benefit of their Princess and Country? No
surely: for if it had been but only suspected that they had seen such a
thing, it would have been as dangerous unto them as it was to Action to have
seen Diana and her maidens naked: Acteons case now come in England.
whose case is so common now in England as nothing more, and so do the
examples of diverse well declare: whose unfortunate knowledge of too many
secrers brought them quickly to unfortunate ends.

Salvatour slain in his bed.
For we hear of one Salvatour a stranger, long used in great mysteries of base
affairs and dishonest actions, who afterward (upon what demerit I know not)
sustained a hard fortune, for being late with my Lord in his study, well near
until midnight, (if I be righ^ly informed) went home to his chamber, and the
next morning was found slain in his bed. We hear also of one Dough^y,
Doughty hanged by Drake.
hanged in haste by Captain Drake upon the Sea, and that by order, as is
thought, before his departure out of England, for that he was over privy to the
secrets of this good Earl.

There was also this last Summer past, The story of Gates hanged at Tiborne.
one Gates hanged at Tiborne, umong others, for robbing of Carriers, which
Gates had been lately Cl^rke of my Lords kitching, and had laid out much money
of his own, as he said, for my Lords provision, being also otherwise in so
great favor and grace with my Lord, as no man living was thought to be more
privy of his secrets then this man, whereupon also it is to be thought, that
he presumed the rather to commit this robbery, (for to such things does my
Lords good favor most extend,) and being apprehended, and in danger for the
same, he made his recourse to his Honor for protection, as the fashion is, and
that he might he borne out, as diverse of less merit had been by his
Lordship, in more heinous causes before him.

The good Earl answered his servant and dear Privado courteously, and assured
him for his life, howsoever for outer show and complement the form of Law
might pass against him. But Gates seeing himself condemned, and nothing now
between his head and the halter, but the word of the Magistrate which might
come in an instant, when it would be too late to send to his Lord: remembering
also the small assurance of his said Lords word by his former dealings toward
other men, whereof this man was too much privy, he thought good to solicit
his case also by some other of his friends, though not so puissant as his Lord
and M^ster, who dealing indeed, both diligently and effectually in his affair,
found the matter more difficult a great deal then either he or they had
imagined: for that my Lord of Leycester was not only not his favourer, but a
great hastener of his death under hand; and that with such care, diligence,
vehemence, and irresistible means, (having the Law also on his side) that
there was no hope at all of escaping: which thing when Gates heard of, he
easily believed for the experience he had of his masters good nature, and said,
that he always mistrusted the same, considering how much his Lordship was in
debt to him, and he made privy to his Lordships foul secrets, which secrets
he would there presently have uttered in the face of all the world, but that
he feared torments or speedy death, with some extraordinary cruelty, if he
should so have done, and therefore he disclosed the same only to a Gentleman
of worship, whom he trusted specially, whose name I may not utter for some
causes, (but it begins with H.) and I am in hope ere it be long, by means
of a friend of mine, to have a fight of that discourse and report of Gates,
which hitherto I have not seen nor ever spoke I with the Gentleman that
keeps it, though I be well assured that the whole matter passed in substance
as I have here recounted it.

Whereunto I answered, that in good faith it were pity that this relation
should be lost, Scholar. This relation of Gates may serve hereafter for an
addition in the second edi^^on of this book.
for that it is very like, that many rare things be declared therein, seeing
it is done by a man so privy to ^he affairs themselves, wherein also he had
been used an instrument. I will have it (quoth the Gentleman) or else my
friends shall fail me, howbeit nor so soon as I would, for that he is in the
West Country that should procure it for me, and will not return for certain
months, but after I shall see him again, I will not leave him until he
procure it for me, as he has promised: well (quoth I) but what is become of
that evidence found in Ireland under my Lords hand, which no man dare pursue,
avouch, or behold.

Truly (said the Gentleman) I am informed that it lies safely reserved in good
custody, Gentleman.
to be brought forth and avouched whenever it shall please God so to dispose
of her Majesty's heart, as to lend an indifferent ear, as well to his
accusers, as to himself, in judgment.

Neither must you think that this is strange, nor that the things are few
which are in such sort reserved in deck for the time to come, The deck
reserved for Leycester.
even among great personages, and of high calling, for seeing the present state
of his power to be such, and the tempest of his tyranny to be so strong and
boisterous, as no man may stand in the rage thereof, without peril, for that
even from her Majesty her self, in the lenity of her Princely nature, he
extorteth what he designeth, either by fraud, flattery, false information,
Leycesters puissan^ violence with the Prince her self.
request, pretense, or violent importunity, to the over-bearing of all, whom
he means to oppress: No marvel then though many even of the best and
faithfullest Subjects of the Land, do yield to the present time, and do keep
silence in some matters, that otherwise they would take it for duty to utter.

And in this kind it is not long sithence a worshipful and wise friend of mine
told me a testimony in secret, from ^he mouth of as noble and grave a
Counselor as England has enjoyed these many hundred years: I mean the late
Lord Chamberlain, The Earl of Sussex his speech of the Earl of Leycester.
with whom my said friend being alone at his house in London, not twenty days
before his death, co^f^rred somewhat familiarly about these and like matters,
as with a true father of his Country and Commonwealth: and after many
complaints in the behalf of diverse, who had opened their griefs unto
Councillors, and saw that no notice would be taken thereof, the said Nobleman,
turning himself somewhat about from the water, (for he sat near his pond
side, where h^e beheld the taking of a Pike or Carpe) said to my friend, It is
no marvel, sir, for who dares intermeddle himself in my Lords affairs? I
will tell you (quoth he) in confidence between you and me, ^here is a^ wise a
man and as grave, and as faithful a Counselor as England breeds, The Lord
Burghley.
(meaning thereby the Lord Treasurer) who has as much of h^s keeping of
Leycesters own handwriting, as is sufficient to hang him, if eith^r he durst
present ^^e same to her Majesty, or her Majesty do ju^^ice when it should be
presented. But indeed (quoth he) the time permits neither of them both, and
therefore it is in vain for any man to struggle with him.

These were that Noblemans words, whereby you may consider whether my Lord of
L^ycester be strong this day in Council or no: and whether his fortification
be sufficient in that place.

But now if out of the Council, we will turn but our eye in the Country
abroad, Leycester^ power in the country abroad.
we shall find as good fortification also there, as we have perused already in
Court and Council: and shall well perceive that this man's plot is no fond or
indiscreet plot, but excellent well grounded, and such as in all proportions
has his due correspondence.

Consider then the chief and principal parts of this land for martial
affairs, for use and commodity of armor, for strength, for opportunity, for
liberty of the people, as dwelling farthest off from the presence and aspect of
their Prince, such parts (I say) as are fittest for sudden enterprises, without
danger of interception: as are the North, the West, the Countries of Wales, the
Islands round about the land, and sundry other places within the same: are they
not all at this day at his disposition? are they not all (by his procurement)
in the only hands of his friends and allies? or of such, as by other matches
have the same complot and purpose with him?

In York is president the man that of all other is fittest for that place,
that is, York Earl of Huntington.
his nearest in affinity, his dearest in friendship, the head of his faction,
and open competitor of the Scepter. Barwick. The Lord Hun^den.
In Barwicke is a Captain, his wives uncle, most assured to himself and
Huntington, as one who at convenient time may as much advance their
designements, as any one man in England.

In Wales the chief authority from the Prince is in his own brother i^ law:
Wales. Sir Hen^y Sidney The Earl of Pembrooke.
but among the people, of natural affection, is in the Earl of Pembrooke, who
both by marriage of his sisters daughter is made his ally, and by dependence is
known to be wholly at his disposition.

The West part of England is under Bedford, The West. Earl of Bedford.
a man wholly devoted to his and the Puritans faction.

In Ireland was governor of late the principal instrument appointed for their
purposes: The Lord Gray.
both in respect of his heat and affection toward their designements, as also
of some secret coffeehouse which he has toward her Majesty and the state
present for certain har^ Her Majesty (^s he says) for striking of Master
Fortesene, calling him lame wretch: that grieved him so, (for that he was hurt
in her service at Lies) as he said, he would live to be revenged.
speeches and ingrate recompenses, as he pretends: but indeed for that he is
known to be of nature fyrie, and impatient of stay, from seeing that
Commonwealth on foot, which the next competitours for their gain have painted
out to him and such others, more pleasant then the Terrestrial Paradise it
self.

This then is the Hector, this is the Ajax appointed for the enterprise, when
the time shall come. This must be (forsooth) another R^c^ard of Warwick, to
gain the Crown for Henry the ninth of the House of York: as the other
Richard did put down Henry the sixth of the House of Lancaster, and placed
Edward the fourth, from whom Huntington deriveth his title therefore this man
is necessarily to be entertained from time to time (as we see now he is) in
some charge and martial action, to the end his experience, power, and credit
may grow the more, and he be able at the time to have soldiers at his
commandment. And for the former charge which held of late in Ireland, as this
man had not been called away, but for execution of some other secret purpose,
In Scotland, or elsewhere, against the next inheritors, or present possessor.
for advancement of their designements: so be well assured that for the time
to come, it is to be furnished again with a sure and fast friend to L^ycester
and to that faction.

trusty servant ^y the death of Captain H^rs^y, Sir Edward Horsey.

but ye^ the matter is supplied by the succession of another, no less assured
unto him then the former, or rather more, through the band of affinity by his
wife. The two Islands of Gersey and Gernsey are in the possession of two friends
and most obliged dependents. Sir Amias Paulet Sir Thomas Layton.
The one, by reason he is exceedingly addicted to the Puritan proceedings: the
other, as now being joined unto him by the marriage of mistress B^sse, his wives
sister, both daughters to Sir Francis, or (at least) to my Lady Knooles, and so
become a rival, companion and brother, who was before (though trusty) yet but
his servant.

And these are the chief Keys, Fortresses, and Bulwarks, within, without and
about the Realm, which my Lord of Leycester possessing, (as he does) he may
be assured of the body within: where notwithstanding (as has been showed) he
wants no due preparation for strength: having at his disposition (besides all
aids and other helps specified before) her Majesty's horse, Her Majesty's
stable, her armor, munition, and artillery The Tower.
and stables, by interest of his own office: her Armor, Artillery, and
Munition, by the office of his brother the Earl of Warwick. The Tower of
London and treasure therein, by the dependence of Sir Owin Hopton his sworn
servant, as ready to rescue and furnish him with the whole, if occasion served,
as one of his predecessors was, to receive his Father in King Edwards day^s,
for the like effect, against her Majesty and her Sister.

And in the City of London it self, London. Sir Rowland Heyward, etc. Mad
Fleetwood, Gentleman.
what this man at a pinch could do, by the help of some of the principal
men, and chief Leaders, and (as it were) Commanders of ^he Commons there, and
by the bestirring of Flee^wood his mad Recorder, and other such his
instruments: as also in all other Towns, Ports, and Cities of importance, by
such of his own setting up, as he has placed there to serve his
designements, and Justices of peace, with other, that in most Shires do wear
his livery, and are at his appointment: the simplest man within the Realm does
consider.

Whereunto if you (...) now his own forces and furniture which he h^th in
Killingworth Castle, and o^he^ places, as also the forces of Huntington in
particular, with their friends, followers, allies and comparten^rs, you shall
find that they are not behi^de in their preparations.

Scholar. My Lord of Huntingtons preparation at Ashby.
For my Lord of Hunting^ons forwardness in the cause (said I) there is no man,
I think, which makes doubt: m^r^y for ^is private forces, albeit they may be
very goo^, for any thing I ^oe know to the contrary, (especially at his house
within five and twenty miles of Killingworth, where one told me some years
past, tha^ he had furniture ready for five thousand men:) yet do ^ not think
but they are far^^ ^^f^riour to my Lord of Leycester, who is taken to have
exc^ssive store, and that in diverse plac^s. Killingworth Castle.
And as for the Castle last mentioned by you, there are men of good
intelligence, and of no small judgment, who ^eport that in the same he has to
furnish ten thousand good soldiers, of all things nec^ssa^y both for horse and
man, besides all other mu^ition, armor, and artillery, (whereof great store
was brought thither under pretense of triumph, when her Majesty was there, and
never as yet carried back again) and besides the great abund^nce of ready
coin there (as is said) sufficient for any great exploit to be done within
the Realm.

And I know that the estimation of this place was such, among diverse, many
years ago: as when at a time her Majesty l^y dangerously sick, and like to
dye, at Hampton Court, a certain Gentleman of the Court came unto my Lord of
Huntington, Ralph Lane.
and told him, that for so much as he took his Lord to be next in succession
after her Majesty, he would offer him a mean of great help for compassing of
his purpose, after the decease of her Maje^^y which was, The offer and
acceptance of Killingworth Castle.
the possession of Killingworth Castle (for at that time these two Earls were
not yet very friends, nor confederate together) and that being had, he showed
to the Earl the great furniture and wealth which the^eby he should possess
for pursuit of his purpose.

The prop^si^ion was well liked, and the matter esteemed of great importance,
and consequently received wi^h many thanks. But yet afterward her Majesty by
the good prov^dence of God, recovering again, let^ed the execution of the
bargain: and my Lord of Huntington having occasion to join amity with
Ley^ester, had more respect to his own commodity, then to his friends
security, (as commonly in such persons and cases it falls out) and so
discovered the whole device unto him, who forgot not after, from time to time,
to plague the deviser by secret means, until he had brought him to that poor
esta^e, as all the world sees: though many men be ^ot acquainted with the true
cause of this his disgrace and bad fortune.

To this answered the Lawyer: Lawyer.
I^ good faith (Gentlemen) you open great mysteries unto me, which either I
knew not, or considered not so particularly before; and no marvel, for that my
profession and exercise of Law, restrains me from much company keeping* and
when I happen to be among some that could tell me much herein, I dare not
either ask, or hear if any of himself begin to talk, lest afterward ^he
speech coming to light, I be f^tched over the coals (as the proverb is) for
the same, under pretense of another thing. But you (who are not suspected for
religion) have mu^^ great^r privilege in such matters, both to ^eare and
speak ag^ine, which men of mine estate dare not doe^ Only this I knew before,
The prerogative of my Lord of Leycester.
that throu^hout all England my Lord of Leycester is taken for Dominus fac
totum: whose excellency above oth^^^ i^ infin^te, whose authority is ab^olu^e,
whose co^^^ndment is dreadful, whose disl^ke is d^ng^ro^^, and whose f^vour is
omnipotent.

And for his will, though it be seldom Law, yet alwaye^ is his power above
law^^ an^ therefore w^e Lawyers in all cases brought unto us, have as great
r^g^rd to his inclination, as Astronomers have to the Pl^net dominant, or as
Seamen have to the North Pole.

For as they that fail, do direct their course according to the situation and
dir^ction of that starr^ which guides them at ^he Pole: and as Astronomers who

the Planet dominant, or bearing rule for ^he time: so we do guide our Clients
ba^ke, an^ do prognosticate what is like to ensue of his cause, by the asp^ct
and inclination of my Lord of L^ycester. And for that reason, as soon as ^ver
we hear a case proposed, o^r custom is to ask, what part my Lord of
L^y^^ster is l^ke to favor in ^he matter, (for in all m^tt^rs l^ghtly of a^y
^^portance he has a part) or what may be gathered of his in^linati^^ therein:
and according to that we give a guess, more or less, what end will ensue But
this (^y Masters) is from the purpose: and therefore returning to you^ former
speech aga^^e, I do say, that alb^6it I was not privy before to the particul^r
p^ov^sions of my Lord and hi^ fr^ends, in such and such places: yet seeing him
ac^ompted Lord General over all the whole Realm, and to have at his
commandment all these several commodities and forces pertaini^g to her
Majesty which you have mentioned before, and so many more as be in the Realm,
and not mentioned by y^u (for in fine he has al:) I could not but account him
(as he is) a potent Prince of our State, for all furniture needful to defense
or offense, or rather the only Monarch of our Nobility, wh^ h^th sufficient
n^edfull to plunge his Prince, if he should be discontented, especially for
his abundance of money, (which, by the wise, Leycesters furniture in money.
is termed the Sinews of Martial actions) wherein by all men's judgments,
he is better furn^shed at this day, then ever any subject of our land, either
ha^h been heretofore, or lightly may be hereafter, both for banks without the
Realm, and stuffed coffers within. Insomuch that being my self in the last
Parliament, when the matter was moved for the grant of a Subsidy, after that,
one for her Majesty had given very good re^sons, why her Highness was in want
of money, and consequently needed the assistance of her faithful subjects
therein, another that sat next me, of good account, said in mine ear
secretly, these reasons I do well allow, The saying of a Knight of the Shire
touching Leycesters money
and am contented to give my part in money: but yet for her Majesty's need, I
could make answer as one answered once the Emperor Tiberius in the like case
and cause, Abunde ei pecuniam fore, si a liberto suo in so^ietatem recipi^tur;
that her Majesty should have Money enough, if one of her servants would
vouchsafe to make her Highness partaker with him; meaning thereby my Lord of
Leycester, whose treasure must needs in one respect be greater then that of her
Majesty; for that he lay^th up wha^soever he gets, and his expenses he
casts upon the purse of his Princess.

For that (said the Gentleman) whether he do or no, it imports little to the
matter: Gentleman,
seeing both that which he spends, and that he hordeth, is truly and
prop^rly his Princes Treasure: and seeing he has so many and d^vers w^yes of

You h^ve said much sir, Lawye^.
(q^oth ^h^ Lawyer) and such matter as touches nearly b^th her Majesty and the
Commonwealth: and yet in my conscience if I were to plead at ^he bar for my
Lord, I could not tell which of all these members to deny. But for that which
you mention in the last part, of h^s gaining by her M^jesties favor, both at
home and ab^oad: Leycesters home gain by he^ Ma^esties fa^our.
Touching his home-gaine, it is evident, seeing all that he has is gotten
only by the opinion of her. Majesty's favor toward him, and many men do
repair unto him with fat presents, rather for that ^hey suppose he may by his
favor do them hurt, if he feel not their reward, then for that they hope he
will labor any thing in their affairs.

You remember (I doubt not) the story of him that offered his Prince a great
yearly rent, A pretty story.
to have but this favor only, that he might come every day in open audience,
and say in his ear, God save your Majesty, assuring himself, that by the
opinion of confidence and secret favor, which hereby the people would conceive
to be in the Prince toward him, he should easily get up his rent again double
told. Wherefore my Lord of Leycester receiving daily from her Majesty greater
tokens of grace and favor then this, and himself being no evil Merchant, to
make his own bargain for the best of his commodities, cannot but gain
exceedingly at home by his favor.

And for his lucre abroad upon the same cause, I leave to other men to conceive
what it may b^, Leycesters foreign gain by her Majesty's favor.
sithence the beginning of her Majesty's reign, the times whereof and
condition of all Christendom has been such, as all the Princes and
Potenta^es round about us, have been constrained at one time or other, to sue
to her Highness for aid, grace, or favor: in all which suits, men use not to
forget (as you know) the parties most able by their c^ed^t, to further or let
the same.

In particular only this I can say, that I have heard of sundry Frenchmen,
that at such time as the treaty was between France and England, for the
re-delivery of Callis unto us again, in the first year of her Majesty's
reign that now is, when the Frenchmen were in great distress and mis^ry, and
King Phi^ip refused absolutely to make peace with them, except Callis were
restored to England (whither for that purpose he had now delivered the French
hostages:) the Frenchmen do report (I say) that my Lord of Leycester stood
them in g^e^t stead at that necessity, Leycesters bribe for betraying of Callis.
for his reward, (which you may well imagine was not small, for a thing of such
importance) and became a suitor, that peace might be con^luded, with the
release of Callis to the French^ which was one of the most impi^us facts (to
say the truth,) that ever could be devised against his Commonwealth.

A small m^tter in him (said the Gentleman) for in this he did no more,
Gentleman.
but as Christ said of the J^wes: that they filled up the measure of their
Fa^hers sins. And so if you read the story of King Edwards time, you shall
find it most evident, that this man's f^ther before him, Leycesters father sold
Bullo^gne.
sold Bullo^g^e ^o the French by like treachery. For it was d^livered up upon
composit^on, without necessity or reason, the five and twentie^h of April, in
^he fourth year of King Edward the sixth, when he (I mea^^ Duke Dudley) had now
put in the Tower the Lord Protector, Earls of Arundel and Southhampton p^t out
of the Council by D. Dudley.
and thrust out of the Counsel whom he listed, as nam^ly, the Earl^s of
A^undel and South^mpton, and so invaded the whole government himse^fe, to sell,
spoil, or dispose at his pleasure. Wherefore this is but natural to my Lord
of Leycester by descent, to make merch^ndise of the S^a^e, for his Grandfather
Edmund also was such a kind of Copesman.

An evil race of Merchants for the Commonwealth (quoth the L^wyer) but yet,
Sir, Lawyer.
I pray you (said he) expound unto me somewh^t more at large, the nature of
these licenses which you named, as also the changing of lands with her Majesty,
if you can set it down any plainer: for they seem to be things of exc^ssive
gain: especially his way of gaining by offending her Majesty, or by her
Highness off^^ce toward him, for it seems to be a device above all skill or
reason.

Leycesters gain by falling out with her Majesty
Not so (quoth the Gentleman) for yo^ know that every falling out must have an
atonement ag^ine, whereof he being su^e by the many and puissant means of
his fr^ends in Court, as I have showed before, who shall not g^ive her Majesty
rest until it be done: then for this a^^onement, and in perf^ct reconciliation
on her M^j^sties part she must g^ant my Lord some su^^ or other, which he will
have alwaye^ ready p^ovided for that purpose, and this suit shall he well ^ble
to reward his friends, that labored for his ^eco^cilement, and leave also a
good remainder for himself. And this is now so ordinary a practice with him,
as all the Real^e obs^rv^th the same, and disdaineth that her Majesty should
be so unworthily ab^sed. For if her H^ghnesse fall not out with him as often
as he desire^h to gain this way, then he picketh some quarrel or other, to
show himself discontented with her, so that one way or other, this gainful
reconciliation must be made, and that often for his commod^ty. The like art he
exercises in inviting her Majesty to his banquets, and to his ho^ses, where if
she come, she must grant him in suits, ten times so much as the charges of
all amount unto: so that Robi^ plays the Broker in all hi^ aff^ires, and
makes the uttermost p^nny of her Majesty every way.

Gentleman.
Now for his change of lands, I think I have been reasonable plain before:
yet for your fuller satisfaction, you shall understand his further dealing
therein, to be in this sort. Besides the good lands, and of ancient possession
to the Crown, procured at her Majesty's hand, and used as before was declared:
he uses the same trick for his worst lands, that he possesses any way,
whether ^hey come to him, by extort means and plai^e oppression, or through
maintenance and broken titles or by consenage of simple Gentlemen, to make him
their heir, or by what h^rd title or unhonest means so ever, Leycesters
fraudulent change of lands wi^h her Majesty whereby he has notably endammaged

(for he practizeth store of such and thinks little of the reckoning:) after
he had tried them likew^se to the uttermost touch, and letten them out to such
as shall gain but little ^y the bargain: then goes he and changes the same
with her Majesty for the best lands he can pick out of the Crown, to the end
that hereby he may both e^force her Majesty to the defense of his b^d titles,
and himself fill his coff^rs with the fines and utt^rmost commodity of both
the lands.

to be transported out of this land, which might have been an undoing to the
Merchant ^ubject, if they had not redeemed the same with great sums of money:
so that it redounded to great damage of all occupied about that kind of
commodity After that he had the grant for carrying over of barrel staves and
of some other such like wares. Then procured he a Monopoly, for bringi^g in
of sweet wines, oils, curran^s and the like: the gain whereof is inestimable.
He h^d also the forfeit of all wine that was to be drawn above the old ordinary
price, with license to give authority to sell above that price: wherein C^ptaine
Horsey was his instrument, by which means it is incredible what treasure and
yearly rent was gathered of the Vintners throughout the land.

were all dec^^ed (as often I have heard diverse Merchants affirm.) And his
license of alienation of lands, which (as in part I have opened before) serves
him not only to excessive gain, but also for an extreme scourge, wherewith
to plague wh^m he pleases in the R^ealm. For seeing that without this licenc^,

a^ ^e were ^ston^shed, and th^n sai^; Ve^ily I have not he^^^ so ma^y and so
app^rant things, or so odious, of any m^n that ^ver lived in our Common wealth.
And I marva^le much of my Lord of Leycester, Edmund Dudley.
that h^^ Grand^^thers fortune does not move him much, who lost his head in the
beginning of King Henry ^he eigh^s days, for much less and f^wer offenses, i^
the same kind, committed in the time of K^^g Henry the seventh: for he was
thought to be the inventour of these pooli^gs and molestations, wherewith the
people were burdened, in the latter days of ^he said King. And yet had he
great pretense of reason to alleged for himself: in that these exactions were
made to the Kings use, and not to his, (albeit no doubt) but his own gain was
also there. M^ster Stow writes in his Cronicle, that in the time of h^s
imprisonment in the Tower, Edmund Dudleis book written in the Tower.
he wrote a not^ble book, entitled The tree of Common wealth, which book the
said Stow says, that he has delivered to my Lord of Leycester many years
agone. And if the said book be so notable as Master Stow affirms: I marvile
that his Lord in so many years, does not publish the sam^, for the glory of
his ancestors?

It may be (said the Gentleman) that the secrets there in contained, be such,
Gentleman.
as it seems good to my Lord, to use them only himself, and to gather the
fruit of the tree into his own house alone. For if the tree of the
Commonwealth in Edmund Dudlis book, be the Prince and his race: and the fruits
to be gathered from that tree, be riches, honors, dignities, and preferments:
then no doubt, but as the writer Edmund was cunning therein: so have his two
followers, John and Robert, well studied and practiced the same, or rather
have, exceeded and far p^ssed the author himself. The one of them gathering
so eagerly, and with such vehemence, as he was like to have broken down the
maine bough^s for greediness: the other yet plucking and heaping so fast to
himself and his friends, as it is and may be, most jus^ly doubted, that when
they have cropped all they can, from the tree left them by their father Edmund
(I mean the race of King Henry the seventh) then will they pluck up the Stem
it self by the roots, as unprofitable: The supplanting of the race of Henry
the 7. The inserting of Huntington.
and pitch in his p^ace another Tru^ke that is the line of Huntington) that may
b^gin to feed a new, with fresh fruits again, and so for a time content their
appetites, until of gatherers, they may become trees, (which is their final
purpose) to feed themselves at their own discretion.

And howsoever this be, it cannot be denied, Edmund D^dleies brood more cunning
then himself.
but that Edm. Dudlis brood, have learned by this book, and by other means to
be more c^nning gatherers, then ever their first progenitor was that made the
book. First for that he made profession to gather to his Prince (though
wickedly) and these men make demonstration, that they have gathered for
themselves: and that with much more iniquity. Secondly, for that E^mund Dudley
though he got himself near about the tree, yet was he content to stand on
the ground, and to serv^ himself from the tree, as commodity was offered: but
his children not e^teeming that ^afe g^th^ring, will needs mount aloft upon the
tree, to pull, croppe, and rifl^ at their pleasure. Northumberland and
Leycester with their Prince will not be roled.
And as in the second poi^t the Son John Dudley was more subt^le, then Edmund
the Father: so in a third point, the Nephey Robert Dudley is more crafty then
^hey both. For that, he seeing the evil success of those two that went
before him, he has provided together so much in convenient time, and to make
himself therewith so fat and strong, (wherein the other two failed) as he will
never be in danger more, to be called to any account for the same.

In good faith Sir (quoth the Lawyer) I thank you heartily, Lawyer.
for this pleas^^t discourse upon Edmund Dudleis tree of Commonwealth. And by
your opinion, my Lord of Leycester is the most learned of all his kindred, and
a very cunning Logitio^er indeed, that can draw for himself so commo^iou^
conclusion, out of the perilous prem^ss^s of his progenitors.

No marvail (quoth the Gentleman) for that his L. is Master of Art in Oxford,
Gentl^man.
and Chancelour besides of the same University, where he h^th store (as you
kn^w) of many fine wits and good Logitioners at his commandment: Leycester
Master of Art, and a cunning Logitioner.
and wh^re he learneth not only the rules and art of cunning gathering: but for
the very practice (as I h^ve touched before) seeing there is no one College,
or other thing of commodi^y w^thin that place, where hence h^ has ^o p^^led,
whatsoever was possibly to be g^thered, e^^her by art or viol^nce.

Tou^hing Oxford (sai^ I) for that I am an U^ivers^ty man my self, Scholar.
and have both experience of C^mbridg^, and good acquaintance with diverse
students of ^^e other university. I can tell you eno^gh, bu^ (...) fine all

is cancelled almost all h^pe of good in th^^ Universi^y: and by his
p^^t^ct^on, it is v^ry lik^ soon to come to d^str^ct^o^. And su^^ly if there
were no other thing, The Lord Treas^rer.
to declar^ the od^es and diff^r^nce betwixt him and our Ch^^ce^l^ur, (whom he
cannot bear, for ^^at ev^^y way h^ s^eth ^im, to p^sse him in ^ll honor an^
virtue) it were sufficient to behold the pr^sent state of the two Universities,
wh^reof they are heads and governors.

For our own, I will not s^y much, Ca^bridge.
lest I might pe^haps seem parti^ll: but let the thing speak for it self.
Consider the fruit of the Garden, and thereby you may judge of the G^rdiners
diligence. Look upon the Bishoprics, Pasto^ships, and Pulpits of England, and
see whence principally they have rec^ived their furniture for advancement of
the Gospel. And o^ the contrary side, look upon the Sem^naries of Papistry a^
Rome and Rhems, upon the Colleges of Jesuists, and other companies of Papists
beyond the seas, and see where-hence they are, e^pecially, fraught.

The Priests and Jesuists here executed within the land, and other that remain
either in pr^son, or abroad in corners: are they not all (in a manner) of that
Universi^y? I speak not to the disgrace of any good that remain there, or that
have issued out th^nce into the Lords Viney^rd: but for the most part there, of
^hi^ ^ur time, have they not either gone beyond ^he seas, or left their places
for coffeehouse in Religion, or else become Serving^en, or followed the bare
name of Law or Physic, without greatly profiting therein, or fur^hering ^he
service of Gods Church, or their Commonwealth?

And wherehence (I pray you) ensues all this, but by reason that the chief
Governor thereof is an Atheist himself, The disorders of Oxford by the
wickedness of their Chancellor
and uses the place only for gain and spoil? for herehence ^t comme^h, that
all good order and discipline is dissolved in that place, the fervor of study
extinguished: the public Lectures abandoned (I mean of the more part:) the
Tavernes and Ordinary tables frequented: the apparel of Students grown
monstrous: and the statutes and good ordinance both of the University and of
every College and Hall in private, br^ken and infri^ged ^t my Lords good
pleas^re, without respect e^th^r of oath, custom, or reason to the contrary.
The heads and Officers are put in and out at his only discretion: and the
Scholars places either told, or d^sp^sed by his letters, or by these of his
servants and followers: nothing can be had th^re, now, without present mon^y:
it is as common buying and selling of places in that University, as of horses
in Smithfield: whereby the good and virtuous are kept out, and companions
thrust in, fit to serve his Lord afterward, in all affairs that shall occur.

Leases.
And as for leases of Farms, Woods, Pastures, Personages, Benefices, or the
like, which belong any way to any part of the University, to let or bestow,
these, his Lord and his Servants have so fleeced, shorn, and scraped already,
that there remains little to feed upon hereafter: albeit he want not still
his (...) and intelligences in the place, to advert^se him from time to ^i^e,
when a^y new little morsel is off^red. Leycesters instrumen^s.
An^ the principal instruments which for this purpose h^ has h^d there before
^his, h^v^ been two Physicians, Bay^y and Culpiper, both kn^wne Papists a
little while ago, but now j^st of G^lens religion, and so much the fitter for
my Lords humor: for his Lordship does always covet, to be furnished with
certain chosen men about (...), for ^ivers affairs: as th^se two Galen^sts in
the Universi^y: De^ and A^^en (two A^heists) for figuring and conjuring: Iu^io
the Italian, and Lopa^ the Jew, for po^soning, and for the art of destroying
children in women's bellies: Verneis for mu^dering: Digbies for At Di^^ies house
in Warwick shi^e dame Lettice (...), and some oth^^ such pieces of pleasure.
Bauds: and the like in occupations which his Lordship exercises.

Wherefore to return to the speech where we began: most ^leare it is, that my
Lord of L^yceste^ has means to g^ine and g^ther also by the University, as
w^l a^ by the country abroad. Wherein (as I am told) he bears h^mselfe so
absolute a Lord, as if he were their King, and not their Chanc^llour. Nay far
more then if he were the general and p^rticular founder of all the Colleges
and other houses of the University; no man daring to contrary o^ interrupt the
leas^ word or signification of his will, but with h^s extreme danger: which i^
a proceeding more fit for Phal^ris the tyrant, or some Governor in T^r^ary,
then for a Chancellor of a learned Universi^y.

To this answ^red the Lawyer, Lawye^,
for my Lords wrath toward such as will no^ stand to his judgment and opinion,
I can m^ self be a sufficient witness, who having had oft^n occasion to deal
for composition of m^tters betwixt his Lordship and others, h^ve seen by
experience, that always they have sped be^^, w^o stood least in conten^ion
with him, whatsoever their cause were. For as a great and violent river, the
more it is stopped or contraried, ^he more it rises and swells big, and in
the end, dej^cteth with more force the thing that made r^sistance: so his

and accustomed now to have his will in all things, cannot bear to be cross^d
or resisted by any man, though it were in his own necessa^y defense.

Hereof I have seen ex^mples in the causes of Snowden forest in Wales, of
Denbighe, of Killingworth, of Drayton, and others: where the pa^^ies that had
^nterest, or thought themselves wronged, had been happy if they ^ad yielded at
the first to h^s Lordships pl^asure, without further question: for ^hen had
they escaped much trouble, ch^rges, displeasure, and vexation, when by
^esistance they incurred, to their great ruin, (and Poor men resisting

loss of life to some) and in the end were feign to submit themselves un^o his
will, wi^h far worse conditions then in the beginning were offered unto them:
which thing wa^ pitiful indeed to b^hold, but yet s^^h is my Lord
disposition.

A noble disposition (quoth the Gentleman,) that I must give him my ^oat, if
he dem^nd the ^ame, and that quickly ^lso, for fear lest i^ I stagger or m^ke
doubt ther^of, he compel me to yield both coat and doublet, in penance of my
stay. I have read of some such Tyrants abroad in the world: marry their end was
always according to their life, as it is very like that it will be also in
this man, for that there is small hope of his amendment, and God passes not
over commonly such matters unpunished in this life, as well as in the life to
come.

But I pray you si^, s^^ing mention is now made of the former opp^essi^ns, so
much talked of throughout the realm, tha^ you will take the pains to explain
the subst^nce thereof un^o me; for albeit in general, every m^n does know ^he
same, and in heart do detest the tyranny th^reof; yet we abroad in the
Country, do do^ understand it so well and distinctly as you that be Lawyers,
who have seen and understood ^he whole process of the same.

The case of K^llingworth and D^nbigh (said the Lawyer) are much alike in
matter and manner of proceeding, Lawyer.
though different in time, place and importance. The Lordship of Denbigh and
^eicesters oppression used therein.
F^r that the Lordsh^p in D^nbigh in Northw^les, being given unto him by her
Majesty a great while ago, at the beginning of his rising, (which is a
L^rdship of singular great importance in that Countr^y, having (as I have
heard) well near 200. worshipful G^ntlemen freeholders to the same:) the
tenants of the place, considering the pr^sen^ state of things, and having
learned the hungry disposition of the^r new Lord; made a common purse of a
th^usand pou^ds, to present him withal, at his first entran^e: which though he
received (as he r^fuseth noth^ng;) yet accounted he the sum of small effect for
satisf^ction of his appeti^e; and therefore applied h^mselfe, not only to m^ke
the ut^ermost that he could by Leases, and such like ways of commodity; but
also he would needs enforce the F^eehol^ers to raise their old rent of the
Lo^dship, from two hundredth and fif^y pounds a year, or thereabouts (at which
rate he had receiv^d the same in gif^ from her Majesty,) unto e^ght or nine
hundre^h pounds by the year, For that he had found out (forsooth) an old
record, (as he said) whereby he could prove, that in ancient time long past,
that Lordship had yielded so much old rent: and therefore he would now enforce
the present tenants, to mak^ up so much again upon their lands, which they
thought was against all reason for them to do: but my Lord perforce, would
have i^ so, and in the end compelled them to yield to his will, to the
impoverishing of all the whole Country about.

The Manor of Killingworth, and Leycesters oppression there.
The like proceeding he used with the tenants about K^llingworth, where he
received the said Lordsh^p and Castle from the Prince, in gift of twenty four
pounds yearly rent or thereabout, has made it now better then five hundredth
by year: by an old record also, found by great fortune in the hole of a wall,
as is given out (for he ha^h singular good luck always in finding out records
for his purpose) by virtue whereof, he has taken from the tenants round about,
their Lands, Woods, Pastures and Commons, to make himself Pa^kes, Chaces, and
other commodities therewith, to the subversion of many a good family, which was
maintained ^here, before this devourer set foot in that Country.

But the matter of Snowden Forest, does pass all the rest, The cause of
Snowden forest most pitiful.
both for cunning and cruelty: the tragedy whereof was this, he had learned by
h^s intelligencers abroad (whereof he had great store in every part of the
Realm) that there was a goodly ancient Forest in Nor^h wales, which has
almost infinite borderers about the same: for it lies in the midst of the
Country, beginning at the hills of Snowden (whereof it has his name) in
Carnarvanshire, and rea^heth every way toward diverse other shires. When my
Lord heard of th^s, he entered presently into the conceit of a singular great
pr^y: going to her Majesty, signified that her highness was often times
abused, by the incroaching of such as dwelt upon her Forests, which was
ne^essary to be restrained; and therefore beseeched her Majesty to bestow upon
him ^he ^ncrochments only, which he should be able to find out upon the Forest
of Snowden, which was granted.

And thereupon he chose out Commissioners fit for the p^rpose, and sent them
into Wales, with the like Commission as a certain Emperor was wont to give
his Majestrates, when they departed from him to govern, as Suetonius writes,
An old tyrannical Commission
Scitis quid velim, and quibus opus habeo. You know what I would have, and wh^t
I have need of. Which recommendation, these Commissioners taking to hear^,
omitted no diligence in execution of the same; and so going into Wales, by such
means as they used, of setting one man to accuse another; brought quickly all
the Country round about in three or four shires, within the compass of
Forest ground; and so entered upon the same, for my Lord of Leic^sters.
Whereupon, when the people were am^zed, and expected what order my Lord
himself would take therein: his Lord was so far off from refusing any part of
that, which hi^ Commissioners had presented and offered him: as he would yet
fur^her stretch the Forest b^yond the Sea, into the Isle of Anglesey, A
rediculou^ demonstration of excessive avaries
and make that also within his compass and bounder.

Which when the Common^lty saw, and that they profited nothing by their
compla^ning and cry^ng out of this tyranny: they appointed to send some
certain number of themselves, to London, to m^ke supplication to the Prince:
and so they did; choosing out for that purpose a dozen G^ntlemen, and many more
of the Commons of the Country of Llin, to deal for the whole. Who com^ng to
London, and exhibiting a most humble suppli^ation to her Majesty for redress
of their oppression: received an answer, by the procurement of my Lord of
Leycester, that they should have justice, if the commonalty would return home
to their houses, and the Gentlemen remain there, to solicit the cause. Which
as soon as they had yielded unto, the Gentlemen were all taken and cast into
prison, and there kept for a great space, and afterward were sent down to
Ludlow, (as the place most eminent of all these Countries) there to wear
papers of perjury, and receive other punishments of infamy. for their
complaining: which punishments notwithstanding, afterward upon great suit of
the parties and their friends, were turned into great fines of money, which
they were constrained to pay, and yet besides to agree also with my Lord of
Leycester for their own lands, A singular oppression.
acknowledging the same to be his, and so to buy it of him again.

Whereby not only these private Gentlemen, but all the whole Country
thereabout, was and is (in a manner) utterly undone. And the participation of
this injury, reaches so far and wide, and is so general in these parts, as
you shall scarce find a man that comes from that coast, who feels no^ the
smart thereof; being either impoverished, beggered or ruinated thereby.

Leycester extremely hated in Wales.
Whereby I assure you that the hatred of all th^^ Country, is so universal and
vehement against my Lord; as I think never thing created by God was so odious
to that Nation, as the very name o^ my Lord of Leic^ster is. Which his Lordship
well knowing, I doubt not, but that he will take hee^ how he go thither to
dwell, or send thither his posterity.

Gentleman.
For his posterity (quoth the Gentleman) I suppose he has little cause to be
solicitour; for that God himself takes care commonly, that goods and honors
so gotten and maintained, as hi^ be, shall never trouble the third heir. Marry
for himself, I confess (the matter standing as you s^y) that he has reason
to forbear that Country, and to leave off his building begun at Denbigh, The
end of tyrants.
as I hear say he has done: for that the universal hatred of a people, is a
perilous matter; and if I were in his Lordships case, I should often think of
the end of Nero; who after all his glory, Nero,
upon fury of the people was adjudged to have his head thrust into a Pilo^y,
and so to be beaten to death with rods and thongs.

Or rather I should fear the success of Vitellius the third Emp^ror after
Nero, Vitellius.
who for his wickedness and oppression of the people, was taken by them at
length, when fortune began to fa^^e^h him, and led out of his Palace naked,
with hooks of Iron fastened in his flesh, and so dr^wn through the City with
infamy, wh^re, lo^en in the streets with filth and ordure cast upon him, and a
pri^k put under his chin, to the end he should not lo^ke down or hide hi^
f^ce, was brought to the bank of Tyber, and there, after many hundred wounds
received, was cast into the river. So implacable a thing is the fur^ur of a
mu^titude, when it is once stirred, and has place of reve^ge. And so heavy is
the hand of God upon tyrants ^n this world, when it pleases his divine Majesty
to take revenge of the same.

I have read in Lean^er, in his description of Italy, how that in Spoleto (if I
be not d^ceived) the chief City of the Country of Umbria, A most terrible
revenge taken upon a tyrant.
there was a strange tyrant; who in the time of his prosperity, contemned all
men, and forbear to injury no man that came within his claws; esteeming himself
sure enough for ever being called to render account in this life, and for the
next he cared little. But God upon the sudden turned upside-downe the wheel of
his felicity, and cast him into the peoples hands; who took him, and bound his
naked body upon a planke, in the M^rket place, with a fire and iron tongues by
him: and then made proclamation, that seeing this man was not otherwise able to
make satisfaction, for the public injuries that he had done; every private
person annoyed by him, should come in order, and with the hot-burning tongues
there ready, should take of his flesh so much, as was correspondent to the
injury received, as indeed they did until the miserable man gave up the ghost,
and after too: as this author writes.

But to the purpose: seeing my Lord cares little for such examples, and is
become so hardy now, as he makes no account to injury and oppress whole
Countries and Commonalties together; Leycesters oppression of particular men.
it shall be bootlesse to speak of his proceedings toward particular men, who
have not so great strength to resist, as a multitude h^th. And yet I can assure
you, that there are so many and so pitiful things published daily of his
tyranny in this kind; as do move great compossion toward the party that do
suffer, and horror against him who shameth not daily to offer such injury.

As for example: whose heart would not bleed to hear the case before mentioned
of M^ster Robinson of Staffordshire; Master Robinson
a proper young Gentleman, and well given both in religion and other virtues;
whose Father died at Newhaven, in her M^j^sties service, under this man's
brother the Earl^ of Warwick; and recommended at his death this his eldest Son,
to the special protection of Leicester and his Brother, whose servant also this
Robinson has bin, from his youth upward, and spent the most of his living in
his service. Yet notwithstanding all this, when Robinsons Lands were entangled
with a certain Londoner, upon interest for^s former maintenance in their
service, whose title my Lord of Leicester (though craftily, yet not covertly)
under Ferris his cloak, had gotten to himself: he ceased not to pursue the
poor Gentleman even to imprisonment, arraignment, and sentence of death, for
greediness of the said living; together with the vexation of his brother in
law Master Harcourt, and all other his friends, upon pretense, forsooth, Master
Harcourt.
that there was a man slain by Robinsons party, in defense of his own
possession against Leicesters intruders, that would by violence break into the
same.

What shall I speak of others, whereof there would be no end? as of his
dealing with M^ster Richard Lee, M. Richr^d Lee.
for his Manor of Hooknorton (if I fail not in the name: Ludowick Gr^vel
) with Master Ludowick Grivell, by seeking to bereave him of all his l^ving at
once, if the drift had taken place? George Witney.
with George Witney, in the behalf of Sir Henry Le^gh, for enforcing him to
forgo the Controlership at Woodstock, which he holds by Patent from King
Hen^y the seventh? with my Lord Barkley* lord Barkley.
whom he enforced to yield up his lands to h^s brother Warwick, which his
ancestors had held quietly for almost two hundre^h years together?

What shall I say of his intolerable tyranny upon the last Ar^hbishop of
Canterbury, Archb^shop of Canterbury.
f^r D^ctor Iulio his s^ke, and that in so foul a matte^? Upon Sir John
Th^o^ma^ton, Sir John Throgmatton.
whom he brought pitifully to his grave before his time, by continual
vexations, for a piece of faithful service done by him to his Country, and to
all the line of King Henry, against this man's Father, in King Edward and Queen
Mary's days? Upon diverse of the Lanes, Lane.
for one man's sake of that name before mentioned, that offered to take Killing
worth-Castle? upon some of the Giffords, Gifford.
and other for Throgmartons sake? (for that is also his Lords disposition, for
one man's cause whom he brooketh not, to plague a whole generation, that any way
pertains, or is allied to the same:) his endless persecuting of Sir Drew
Drew^y, Sir Drew Drewry
and many other Courtiers, both men and women? All these (I say) and many
others, who daily suffer injuries, rapines and oppr^ssions at his hands,
throughout the Realm, what should it avail to name them in th^s place? seeing
neither his Lord cares any thing for the same, neither the parties agrieved
are like to attain any least release of affliction thereby, but rather ^ouble
oppression for their complaining.

The presentstate of my Lord of Leycester.
Wher^fore to return again whereas we began; you see by this little, who, and how
great, and what manner of m^n, my Lord of Leycester is this day, in the state
of England. You see, and may gather, in some part, by that which has bin
spoken, his wealth, his strength, his cunning, his disposition. His wealth is
excessive in all kind of riches for a private man, Leicesters wealth
and must needs be much more, then any body lightly can imagine, for the
infinite ways he has had of gain, so many ye^res together. Leycest. strength
His strength and power is absolute and irresistible, as has been showed both
in Chamber, Court, Council and Country. His cunning in plotting and fortifying
the same, Leycest cunning
both by force and fraud, by Mines and countermines, by trenches, bulwarke^,
flaukers and rampires* by friends, enemies, alsies, servants, creatures, and
dependents, or any other that may serve his turn; is very rare and singular.
His disposition to cruelty, murder, treason and tyranny: Leycesters disposition.
and by all these to supreme Sovereignty over other, is most evident and
clear. And then judge you whether her Majesty that now reigns (whose life
and prosperity, the Lord in mercy long preserve,) have not just cause to fear,
in respect of these things only; if there were no other particulars to prove
his aspiring intent besides?

No doubt (quoth the Lawyer) but these are great matters, Lawyer.
in the question of such a cause as is a Crown And we have seen by example,
that the least of these four, which you have here named, or rather some little
branch contained in any of them, has bin sufficient to found just suspicion,
Causes of just fear for her Majesty.
distrust or jealousy, in the heads of most wise Princes, toward the
proceedings of more assured subjects, then my Lord of Leycester, in reason may
be presumed to be. For that* the safety of a state and Prince, stands not
only in the readiness and hability of resisting open attempts, when they
shall fall out; but also (and that much more as Statists write) in a certain
provident watchfulness, of preventing all possibilities and likelihoods of
danger of suppression, for that no Prince commonly, will put himself to the
curt^sie of another man) be he never so obliged) whether he shall retain his
Crown or no: seeing the cause of a Kingdom, acknowledges neither kindred,
duty, faith, friendship, nor society.

I know not whether I do expound or declare my self well or no; but my meaning
is, that whereas every Prince has two points of ^ssurance from his subject; the
one, in that he is faithful, and lacks will to annoy his Sovereign; the
other, for that he is weak and wants ability to do the same: A point of
necessary policy for a Prince.
the first is always of more importance then the second, and consequently more
to be eyed and observed in policy: for that our will may be changed at our
pleasure, but not our ability.

Considering then upon that which has been said and specified before, how
that my Lord of Leicester has possessed himself of all the strength, powers
and sinews of the Realm, has drawn all to his own direction, and has made
his party so strong, as it seems not resistable: you have great reason to
say, that her Majesty may justly conceive some doubt, for that if his will were
according to his power, most assured it is, that her Majesty were not in safety.

Scholar.
Say not so, good sir, (quoth I) for in such a case truly, I would repose little
upon his will, which is so many ways apparent, to be most insatiable of
ambition. Rather would I think that as yet his ability serves not, either for
time, place, force, or some other circumstance: then that any part of good will
should want in him; seeing that not only his desire of sovereignty, but also
his intent and attempt to aspire to the same, is sufficiently declared (in my
conceit) by the very particulars of his power and plots already set down.
Which if you please to have the patience, to hear a Scholars argument, I will
prove by a principle of our Philosophy.

A philosophical argument to prove Leycesters intent of sovereignty.
For if it be true which Aristotle says, there is no agent so simple in the
world, which works not for some final end, (as the bird builds not her
nest but to dwell and hatch her young ones therein:) and not only this, but
also that the same agent, does always frame his work according to the
proportion of his intended end: (as when the Fox or Badger makes a wide earth
or den, it is a sign that he means to draw thither great store of prey:)
then must we also in reason think, that so wise and politic an agent, as is
my Lord of Leicester for himself, wants not his end in these plottings and
preparations of his; I mean an end proportionable in greatness to his
preparations. Which end can be no less nor meaner then supreme Sovereignty,
seeing his provision and furniture do tend that way, and are in every point
fully correspondent to the same.

What means his so diligent besieging of the Princes person? The preparation^
of Leycest^r declare his intended end.
his taking up the w^yes and passages about her? his insolency in Court? his
singularity in the Council? his violent preparation of strength abroad? his
enriching of his accomplices? the banding of his faction, with the abundance of
friends every where? what do these things signify (I say) and so many other,
as you have well noted and mentioned before; but only his intent and purpose
of Supremacy? What did the same things portend in times past in his Father, but
even that which now they portend in the Son? Or how should we think, that
the Son has another meaning in the very same actions, then had his Father
before him, whose steps he follows.

I remember I have heard oftentimes of diverse a^cient and grave men in
Cambridge, How the Duke of Northumberland dissembled his end.
how that in King Edwards days the Duke of Northumberland this man's Father,
was generally suspected of all men, to mean indeed as afterward he showed,
especially when he had once joined with the house of Suffolk, and made himself
a principal of that faction by marriage. But yet for that he was potent, and
protested every where, and by all occasions his great love, duty, and special
care, above all others, that he bare towar^s his Prince and Country; no m^n
durst accuse him openly, until it was too l^te to withstand his power, (as
commonly it falle^h out in such affairs) and the like is evident in my Lord of
Leycesters actions now (albeit to her Majesty, I doubt not, but that he will
pretend and protest, as his Father did to her Brother) especially now after his
open association with the faction of Hu^tington; which no less impugneth under
this man's protection, the whole line of Henry the seventh for right of the
Crown, then the house of Suff^lke did under his Father the p^rticul^r progeny
of King Henry the eight.

Gentleman.
Nay rather much more (quoth the Gentleman) for that I do not read in King
Edwards reign, (when the matter was in plotting no^withstanding) that the
house of Suffolk^ durst ever make open claim to the next succ^ssion. The
boldness of the titlers of Clarence.
But now the house of Hast^ngs is b^come so confident, upon the strength and
favor of their fautors, as they dare both plot, practice and pretend, all at
once, and f^ar not to set out their title, in every place where they come.

Lawyer.
And do they not fear the statute (said the Lawyer) so rigorous in this point,
as it makes the matter treason to determine of titles?

Gentleman.

The abuse of ^he Statute for silence in the true succession.


No: they need not (quoth the Gentleman) seeing their party is so strong and
terrible, as no man dare accuse them: seeing also they well know, that the
procurement of that Statute, was only to endanger or stop the mouths of the
true Successors, whiles themselves in the mean space went about under hand, to
establish their own ambushment.

Well: (quoth the Lawyer) for the pretense of my Lord of Huntington to the
Crown, Lawyer.
I will not stand with you, for that it is a matter suffic^ently known and seen
throughout the Realm. As also that my Lord of Leyceste^ is at this day a
principal favourer and patron of that cause, albeit some years past, he were
an earnest adversary and enemy to the same. But yet I have heard some fri^nds
of his, in reasoning of these matters, de^y stoutly a point or two, which you
have touched here, and do seem to believe the same.

And that is, first, Two excuses alleged by Leycesters friends.
that howsoever my Lord of Leicester do mean to help his friend, when time
shall serve, yet pretends he nothing to the Crown himself. The second is.
that whatsoever may be meant for the title, or compassing the Crown after her
M^jesties death, yet nothing is intended during her reign. And of both these
points they allege reasons.

As for the first, that my Lord of Leycester is very well known to have no
title to the Crown himself, either by descent in blood, alliance or
otherw^yes. For the second, that his Lord. has no cause to be a M^lecontent in
the present government, nor h^pe for more preferment, if my Lord of Huntington
were King to morrow next, then he receives now at her Maj^sties hands; having
all the Realm (as has bin showed) at his own disposition.

For the first (quoth ^e Gentleman) whether he mean the Crown for hims^lf^,
Gentlemen.
or for his friend, it imports not much; Whether Leycester mean the Crown
si^ce^ely for Hunt^ngton or for himself.
seeing both ways i^ is ^vident, that he meane^h to h^ve all at his own
disposition. And albeit now for the avoiding of envy, he give it out, as a
crafty Fox, that he means not but to run wi^h other men, and to hunt with
Huntington and o^h^^ hounds in the some chase; yet is it not unlike, but that
he will pl^y the Bear, when he co^eth to div^ding of the pray, and will snatch
the best p^rt to himself. Yea, and these self same persons of his train an^
^action, whom you call his friend, though in publ^que, to excuse his doings,
and to cover the whol^ plot, they will and must deny the matters to be so
meant: yet otherwise they both think, hope and know the contrary, and will not
stick in secret to spe^k it, and among th^mselves, it is their talk of
consolation.

North, to Master Pooly.
are known, which he uttered to his trusty Pooly, upon the receipt of a letter
from Court, of her Majesty's displeasure toward him, for his being a witness
at Leycesters second marriage with D^me Lettice (although I know he was not
ignorant of the first) at Wanstead: of which displeasure, this Lord making f^r
less account then, in reason he should, of the just offense of his sovereign,

The words of Sir Thomas Layton brother in law to my Lord.
The words also of Sir Thomas Layton, to Sir Henry Nevile, walking upon the
Ta^resse at Windsor are known, who told him, after long discourse of their
happy conceived Kingdom, that he doubted not, but to see him one day, hold
the same office in Windsor, of my Lord of Leycester, which ^ow my Lord did hold
of the Queen. Meaning thereby the goodly office of Constableship, wi^h all
Roy^lties and honors belonging to the same, which now the said Sir Henry
exercises only as Deputy to the Earl. Which was plainly to signify, that,
he doubted not but to see my Lord of Leycester one day King, or else his other
hope could never possibly ta^^ effect or come to pass.

To the same point ^ended the words of Mistress^ Anne West, Da^e Lettice
sister, The words of Mistress Anne West sister unto this holy Countess.
unto the Lady Anne Askew, in the great Chamber, upon a day when her broth^r
Robert K^owles had danced disgratiously and scornfully before the Queen in
p^esence of the French. Which thing for that her Majesty took to proceed of
wis^in him, ^s for disl^ke of the strangers in presence, and for the quarrel
of his sister Essex; it pleased her Majesty to check him for the same, with
addition of a reproachful word or two (full well deserved) as though done for
despite of the forced abse^ce from that place of honor, of the good old
Gentlewoman (I mitigate the wor^s) his sister. Which words, the other young
twig receiving in deep dudgen, brake forth in great choler to her forenamed
companion, and said, That she nothing doubted, but that one day she should see
her sister, upon whom the Queen railed now so much (for so it pleased her to
term her Majesty's sharp speech) to sit in her place and throne, being much
worthier of the same, for her qualities and rare virtues, then was the other.
Which undut^full speech, albeit it were overheard and condemned of diverse that
sat about them, yet none durst ever report the same to her Majesty, as I h^ve
heard sundry Courtiers affirm, in respect of the revenge which the reporters
should abide at my Lord of Leycesters hands, whenever the m^t^er should come
to light.

And this is now concerning the opinion and secret speeches of my Lords own
friends, who cannot but utter their conceit and judgment in time and place
convenient, whatsoever they are w^lled to give out publicly to the contrary,
for deceiving of such as will believe fair painted words, against evident and
manifest demonstration of reason.

Three arguments of Leycesters meaning for himself before Huntington.
I say reason, for that if none of these signs and tokens were, none of these
preparations nor any of these speeches and detections, by his friends that know
his heart; yet in force of plain reason, I could allege unto you three
arguments only, which to any man of intelligence, would easily persuade and
give satisfact^on, that my Lord of Leycester means best and first for
himself in this su^t. Which three arguments, for that you seem to be attent;
I will not stick to run over in all brevity.

The first argu^ent, the Nature of amb^tion.
And the first, is the very nature and quality of ambition it self, which is
such, (as you know) that it never stays, but passes from degree to degree
and the more it obtains, the more it covers, and the more esteems it
self, both worthy and able to obtain. And in our matter that now we handle;
even as in wooing, he ^h^t su^th to a Lady for another, and obtains her good
will, enters easily into conceit of his own wo^thinesse thereby, and so
commonly into hope of speedin^ himself, while he speaks for his friend so
much more in Kingdoms: he that s^eth himself of power to put the Crown of
another man's head, will q^ckly step to the next degree, which is, to set it of
his own, see^ng that alway^s the charity of such good men, is wont to be so
orderly, as (according to ^he precep^) it b^ginneth with it self first.

Add to this, that ambition is jealous, suspicious and fearful of it self,
especially when it is j^yned with a conscience laden with the guilt of many
crimes, whereof he would be loath to be called to account, or be subject to any
man that might by au^hority take review of his life and actions, when it should
please him. In which kind, seeing my Lord of Leycester has so much to
increase his fear, as before has been showed by his wicked dealings: it is
not like, that ever he will put himself to another man's courtesy, for
passing his audict in particular reckonings, which he can no way answer or
satisfy: but rather will stand upon the gross Sum, and general Quietus est,
by making himself chief Auditour, and Master of all accounts for his own
part in this life, howsoever he do in the next: whereof such humors have
little regard. And this is for the nature of ambition in it self.

The second argument may be taken from my Lords particular disposition: which
is such, The second argument. Leycesters particular disposition.
as may give much light also to the matter in question: being a disposition so
well liking and inclined to a Kingdom, as it has been tampering about the
same, from the first day that he came in favor. Leycesters disposition to
tamper for a Kingdom.
First, by seeking openly to marry with the Queens Majesty her self, and so
to draw the Crown upon his own head, and to his posterity. Secondly, when
that attempt took not place, then he gave it out, as has been showed
before, how that he was privily contracted to her Majesty, (wherein as I told
you his dealing before for satisfaction of a stranger, so let him with shame
and dishonor remember now also, I mean the noble old Earl of Pembrooke.
the spectacle he secretly made for the persuading of a subject, and
Counselor of great honor in the same cause) to the end that if her Highness
should by any way have miscarried, then he might have entitled any one of his
own brood, (whereof he has store in many places as is known) to the lawful
succession of the Crown, under color of that privy and secret marriage,
pretending the same to be by her Majesty: wherein he will want no witnesses
to depose what he will.

Thirdly, The undutifull devise of Natural issue, in the Statut^ of succession.
when he saw also that this devise was subject to danger, for that his privy
contract might be denied more easily, then he able justly to prove the same,
after her Majesty's decease: he had a new fetch to streng^hen the matter, and
that was to cause these words of ( Natural issue) to be put into the Statute
of succession for the Crown, against all order and custom of our Realm, and
against the known common style of Law, accustomed to be used in Statutes of
such matter: whereby he might be able after the death of her Majesty, to make
ligitimate to the Crown any one bastard of his own, by any of so many
hacknies as he keeps, affirming it to be the Natural issue of her Majesty
by himself. For no other reason can be imagined why the ancient usual words
of Lawful issue should so cunningly be changed into Natural issue; thereby
not only to endanger our whole Realm with new quarrels of succession, but
also to touch (as far as in him lies) the Royal honor of his Sovereign,
who has been to him but too bountiful a Princess.

Fourthly, when after a time these fetches and devices began to be discovered,
he changed straight his course, and turned to the Papists and Scottish faction,
pretending the marriage of the Queen in prison. But yet after this again,
finding therein not such success as contented him thoroughly, and having in the
mean space a new occasion offered of bait; he betook himself fifthly to the
party of Huntington: having therein (no doubt) as good meaning to himself, as
his Father had by joining with Suffolk. Marry yet of late, he has cast anew
about, once again, ^or himself in secret, by treating the marriage of young
Arbella with his Son, The marriage of Arbella.
entitled the Lord Denbigh.

So that by this we see the disposition of this man bent wholly to a scepter.
And albeit in right title, and descent of blood (as you say) he can justly
claim neither Kingdom nor Cottage (considering either the baseness or
disloyalty of his Ancestors:) if in respect of his present state and power,
and of his natural pride, ambition, and crafty conveyance, received from his
Father, he has learned how to put himself first in possession of chief
rule, under other pretenses, and after to devise upon the title at his leisure.

But now to come to the third argument: The third argument.
I say more, and above all this, that the nature and state of the matter it
self, permits not, The nature of the cause it self.
that my Lord of Leycester should mean sincerely, the Crown for Huntington;
especially seeing there has passed between them so many years of dislike and
enmity: which albeit, for the time and present commodity, be covered and
pressed down: yet by reason and experience we know, that afterward when they
shall deal together again in matters of importance, and when jealousy shall
be joined to other circumstances of their actions, it is impossible that the
former mislike should not break out in far higher degree, then ever before.

As we saw in the examples of the reconciliation, The nature of old reconciled
enmity.
made betwixt this man's Father, and Edward, Duke of Somerset, bearing rule
under King Edward the sixth: and between Richard of Y^rke, and Edmund Duke of
Somerset, bearing rule in the time of King H^nry the sixth. Both which Dukes of
Somerset, after reconciliation with their old, crafty, and ambitious enemies,
were bro^ght by the same to their destruction soon after. Whereof I doubt not,
but my Lord of Leycester will take good heed, in joining by reconciliation with
Huntington, after so long a breach: and will not be so improvident, as to make
him his sovereign, who now is but his dependent. He remembers too well the
success of the Lord Stanley, who helped King Henry the seventh to the Crown:
of the Duke of Buckingham, who did the same for Richard the third: of the Earl
of Warwick, who set up King Edward the fourth: and of the three Percies, who
advanced to the Scepter King Henry the fourth. All which Noblemen upon
occasions that after fell out, were rewarded with death by the self same
Princes, whom they had preferred.

The reason of Machavell.
And that not without reason, as Seignior Machavell, my Lords Counselor
affirms. For that such Princes, afterward can never give sufficient
satisfaction to such friends, for so great a benefit received. And
consequently, least upon coffeehouse, they may chance to do as much for
others against them, as they have done for them against others: the surest way
is, to recompense them with such a reward, as they shall never after be able to
complain of.

Wherefore I can never think that my Lord of Leycester will put himself in
danger of the like success at Huntingtons hands: but rather will follow the
plot of his own Father, The meaning of the Duke of Northumberland with
Suffolk.
with the Duke of Suffolk, whom no doubt, but he meant only to use for a
pretext and help, whereby to place himself in supreme dignity, and afterward
whatsoever had befallen of the state, the others head could never have come to
other end, then it enjoyed. For if Queen Mary had not cut it off, King John of
Northumberland would have done the same in time, and so all men do well know,
that we^e privy to any of his cunning dealings.

And what Huntingtons secret opinion of Leycester is, (notwithstanding this
outward show of dependence) it was my chance to learn, South-house:
from the mouth of a special man of that hasty King, who was his Ledger or
Agent in London; and at a time falling in talk of his Masters title, declared
that he had heard him diverse times in secret, complain to his Lady, (
Leycesters sister) as greatly fearing that in the end, he would offer him
wrong, and pretend some title for himself.

Well (quoth the Lawyer) it s^emeth by this last point, Lawyer.
that these two Lords are cunning practitioners in the art of dissimulation:
but for the former whereof you speak, in truth, I have heard men of good
discourse affirm, The meaning of the D. of Northumberland toward the D. of
Suffolk.
that the Duke of Northumberland had strange devises in his head, for deceiving
of Suffolk, (who was nothing so fine as himself,) and for bringing the Crown
to his own Family. And among other devises it is thought, that he had most
certain intention to marry the Lady Mary himself, after once he had brought
her into his own hands) and to have bestowed her Majesty that now is, upon
some one of his children (if it should have been thought best to give her
life, (and so consequently to have shaken off Suffolk and his pedigree, with
condign punishment, for his bold behavior in that behalf.

Verily (quoth I) this had been an excellent Stratageme, if it had taken
place. Scholar.
But I pray you (Sir) how could himself have taken the Lady Mary to wife,
seeing he was at that time married to another?

O (quoth the Gentleman) you question like a Scholar. Gentleman.
As though my Lord of Leycester had not a wife alive, when he first began to
pretend marriage to the Queens Majesty. Do not you remember the story of King
Richard the third, who at such time as he thought best for the establishing of
his title; The practice of King Richard for dispatching h^s Wife.
to marry his own Niece, that afterward was married to King Henry the seventh,
how he caused secretly to be given abroad that his own wife was dead, whom all
the World knew to be then alive and in good health, but yet soon afterward
she was seen dead indeed These great pe^sonages in matters o^ such weight, as
is a Kingdom, have privil^dges to dispose of Women's bodies, marriages, lives
and deaths, as shall be thought for the time most convenient.

A new Triumvir^^ ^^tween Leycester, Talbot, and ^h^ Co^ntesse of Shr^ve^bury.
And what do you think (I pray you) of this new T^iumvirat so lately concluded
about Arbell^? (for so I must call the same, though one of the three persons
be no Vir, but Virago;) I mean of the ma^riage between young Denbigh and the
little Daughter of Lenox, whe^eby the Father-in-law, the Grandmother, and the
Uncle of the new designed Queen, have conceived to themselves a singular
triumphant reign. But what do you think may ensue hereof? is there nothing of
the old plot of Duke John of Northumberland in this?

Lawyer.
Marry Sir, (quoth the Lawyer) if this be so, I dare assure you there is sequel
enough pretended hereby. And first, no doubt but there goes a deep drift, by
the wife and son, against old Abraham (the Husband and Father) with the
well-lined large pouch. And secondly, a far deeper, by trusty Robert against
his best Mistress: but deepest of all by the whole Crew, against the
designements of the hasty Earl; Huntington.
who thirsts a Kingdom with great intemperance, and seems (if there were
plain dealing) to hope by these good people to quench shortly his drought.

But either part, in truth, seeks to deceive other: and therefore it is hard
to say where the game in fine will rest.

Well, Gentleman.
howsoever that be (quoth the Gentleman) I am of opinion, that my Lord of
Leycester will use both this practice and many more, for bringing the Scepter
finally to his own head: The sleights of Leycester for bringing all to
himself.
and that he will not only employ Huntington to defeat Scotland, and Arbella
to defeat Huntington: but also would use the marriage of the Queen
imprisoned, to defeat them both, if she were in his hand: and any one of all
three to dispossess her Majesty that now is: as also the authority of all
four to bring it to himself: with many other fetches, flings and friscoes
besides, which simple men as yet do not conceive.

And howsoever these two conjoined Earls, Scambling between Le^cester and
Huntington at the upshot.
do seem for the time to draw together, and to play booty: yet am I of
opinion, that the one will beguile the other at the upshot. And Hastings, for
ought I see, when he comes to the scambling, is like to have no better luck
by the Bear, then his Ancestour had once by the Boar. Who using his help
first in murdering the Son and Heir of King Henry the sixth, and after in
destroying the faithful Friends and Kinsmen of King Edward the fifth, for his
easier way to usurpation: Richard of Gloucester, A^t. 1. Edw. 5.
made an end of him also in the Tower, at the the very same day and hour, that
the other were by his counsel destroyed in Pontfret Castle. So that where the
Goal and price of the game is a Kingdom, there is neither faith, neither good
fellowship, nor fair play among the Gamesters. And this shall be enough for
the first point: ( viz.) what good my Lord of Leycester means to himself in
respect of Huntington.

Touching the second, whether the attempt be purposed in her Majesty's days or
no, 2. That the conspirator^ mean in her Majesty's days.
the matter is much less doubtful, to him that knows or can imagine what a
torment the delay of a Kingdom is, to such a one as suffers hunger thereof,
and fears that every hour may breed some alteration, to the prejudice of his
conceived hope. We see oftentimes that the child is impatient in this matter,
to expect the natural end of his parents life. Whom, notwithstanding, by
nature he is enforced to love: and who also by nature, is like long to leave
this World before him: and after whose decease, he is assured to obtain his
desire: but most certain of dangerous event, if he attempt to get it, while
yet his parent lives. Which four considerations are (no doubt) of great force
to contain a child in duty, and bridle his desire: albeit sometimes not
sufficient to withstand the greedy appetite of reigning.

^oure considerations.
But what shall we think, where none of these four considerations do
restrain? where the present Possessor is no parent? where she is like by
nature, to outlive the expector? whose death must needs bring infinite
difficulties to the enterprise? and in whose lifetime the matter is most easy
to be achieved, under color and authority of the present Possessor? shall we
think that in such a case the ambitious man will overruled his own passion,
and leese his commodity.

As for that which is alleged before, for my Lord in the reason of his
Defenders: A thing worthy to be noted in ambitious men.
that his present state is so prosperous, as he cannot expect better in the
next change whatsoever should be: is of small moment, in the conceit of an
ambitious head, whose eye and heart is always upon that, which he hops for,
and enjoys not: and not upon that which already he possesses, be it never
so good. Especially in matters of honor and authority, it is an infallible
rule, that one degree desired and not obtained, afflicts more then five
degrees already possessed, can give consolation: the story of Duke Ham^n
confirms this evidently, who being the greatest subject in the World under
King Assuerus, H^stor. 5.
after he had reckoned up all his pomp, riches, glory, and felicity to his
friends, yet he said, that all this was nothing unto him, until he could
obtain the revenge which he desired, upon Ma^d^chaeus his enemy: and hereby
it comes ordinarily to pass, that among highest in authority are found the
greatest store of Malcontents, that most do endanger their Prince and
Country.

When the Percies took part with Henry of Bolingbrooke, The Pe^cies.
against King Richard the second their lawful Sovereign: it was not for lack
of preferment, for they were exceedingly advanced by the said King, and
possessed the three Earledomes of Northumberland, Wor^ester, and Stafford
together, besides many other offices and dignities of honor.

In like sort, when the two Neviles took upon them to join with Richard of
York, The two Neviles.
to put down their most benign Prince, King Henry the sixth: and after again
in the other side, to put down King Edward the fourth, it was not upon want of
advancement: they being Earls both of Salisbury and Warwick, and Lords of many
notable places besides. But it was upon a vain imagination of future fortune,
whereby such men are commonly led: and yet had not they any smell in their
nostrils of getting the Kingdom for themselves, as this man has to prick him
forward.

If you say that these men hated their Sovereign, Leyceste^s hatred to her
Majesty.
and that thereby they were led to procure his destruction: the same I may
answer of my Lord living, though of all men he has least cause so to do. But
yet such is the nature of wicked ingratitude, that where it owes most, and
disdaineth to be bound, there upon every little coffeehouse, The evil
nature of ingratitude.
it turns double obligation into triple hatred.

This he showed evidently in the time of his little disgrace, wherein he no^
only did diminish, vilipend, and debase among his friends, the inestimable
benefits he has received from her Majesty, but also used to exprobrate his
own good services and merits, and to touch her highness with ingrate
consideration and recompense of the same; which behavior, together with his
hasty preparation to rebellion, and assault of her Majesty's Royal person and
dignity, upon so small a cause given, did well show what mind inwardly he
bears to his Sovereign, L^ycesters speeches of her Majesty in the time of
his disgrace.
and what her Majesty may expect, if by offending him, she should once fall
within the compass of his furious paws: seeing such a smoke of disdain^ could
not proceed, but from a fiery furnace of hatred within.

And surely it is a wonderful matter to consider what a little check, or
rather the bare imagination of a small overthwart, may work in a proud and
disdainful stom^cke. The remembrance of his marriag^ miss^d, that he so much
pretended and desired with her Majesty, The causes of hatred in Leycester
toward her Majesty.
does stick deeply in his bre^st, and stirs him daily to revenge. As also
does the disdain of certain checks and disgraces received a^ sometimes,
especially that of his last marriage: which irketh him so much the more, by how
much greater fear and danger it brought him into at that time, and did put his
Widow in such open frenzy, as she raged many months after against her
Majesty, and is not cold yet, but remains as it were a sworn enemy for that
injury, and stands like a fiend or fury at the elbow of her Amadis, to stir
him forward when occasion shall serve. The force of female suggestions.
And what effect such female suggestions may work, when they find an humor
proud and pliable to their purpose, you may remember by the example of the
Duchess of Somerset, who enforced her Husband to cut off the head of his only
dear Brother, to his own evident destruction, for her contentation.

Wherefore, An evident conclusion that the execution is meant in time of her
Majesty.
to conclude this matter without further dispute or reason: saying, there is so
much discovered in the case as there is: so great desire of reign, so great
impatience of delay, so great hope and hability of success, if it be attempted
under the good fortune and present authority of the competitours: seeing the
plots be so well laid, the preparation so forward, the favorers so furnished,
the time so propitious, and so many other causes conviting together: seeing
that by differing, all may be hazarded, and by hastening, little can be
endangered; the state and condition of things well weyed: finding also the
bands of duty so broken already in the conspiratours, the causes of mislike and
hatred so manifest, and the solicitours to ex^cution, so potent and diligent,
as women, malice, and ambition, are wont to be: it is more then probable, that
they will not leese their present commodity, especially seeing they have
learned by their Archi-tipe or Proto-plot which they follow, (I mean the
conspiracy of Northumberland and Suffolk in King Edwards days) that herein
there was some error committed at that time, An error of the Father now to
be corrected by the Son.
which overthrew the whole; and that was, the deferring of some things until
after the Kings death, which should have been put in execution before.

For if in the time of their plotting, when as yet their designements were not
published to the world, they had under the countenance of the King (as well
they might have done) gotten into their hands the two Sisters, and dispatched
some other few affairs, before they had caused the young Prince to die: no
dobut, but in man's reason the whole designement had taken place: and
consequently it is to be presupposed, that these men (being no fools in their
own affairs) will take heed of falling into the like error by delay: but
rather will make all sure, by striking while the iron is hot, as our proverb
warns them.

Lawyer.
It cannot be denied in reason (quoth the Lawyer) but that they have many
helps of doing what they list now, under the present a favor, countenance,
and authority of her Majesty, which they should not have after her Highness
decease: when each man shall remain more at liberty for his supreme
obedience, by reason of the statute provided for the uncertainty of the next
successor: and therefore I for my part, would rather counsel them to make much
of her Majesty's life; for after that, they little know what may ensue, or
befall their designements.

Gentleman.
They will make the most thereof (quoth the Gentleman) for their own advantage,
but after that, what is like to follow, the examples of Edward and Richard the
second, as also of Henry and Edward the sixth, do sufficiently fore-warne us:
whose lives were prolonged, until their deaths were thought more profitable to
the conspiratours, and not longer. Her Majest^es life and death, to serve the
conspiratours turn.
And for the statute you speak of, procured by themselves, for establishing the
incertainty of the next true successor, (whereas all our former statutes were
wont to be made for the declaration and certainty of the same) it is with
Proviso, (as you know) that it shall not endure longer then the life of her
Majesty, that now reigns: that is, indeed, no longer then until themselves
be ready to place another. For then, no doubt, but we shall see a fair
Proclamation, A Proclamation with halters.
that my Lord of Huntington is the only next heir: with a bundle of halters
to hang all such, as shall dare once open their mouth for denial of the same.

At these words the old Lawyer stepped back, Lawyer.
as somewhat astonished, and began to make Crosses in the air after their
fashion, whereat we laughed; Papisticall blessing.
and then he said, truly my Masters I had thought that no man had conceived so
evil imagination of this statute as my self: but now I perceive that I alone
am not malicious. For my own part, The statute of concealing the heir
apparent.
I must confess unto you, that as often as I read over this statute, or
think of the same (as by diverse occasions many times I do) I feel my self
much greeved and afflicted in mind, upon fears which I conceive what may be
the end of this statute to our Country, and what privy meaning the chief
procurers thereof might have for their own drifts, against the Realm and life
of her Majesty that now reigns.

And so much more it makes me to doubt, Richard going toward Jerusalem,
began the custom by Parliament, as Polidore notes, Anno 10. of Richard the
second, to declare the next heir.
for that in all our records of law, you shall not find (to my remembrance) any
one example of such a devise for concealing of the true inheritour: but rather
in all ages, states, and times, (especially from Richard the first downward)
you shall find statutes, ordinances, and provisions, for declaration and
manifestation of the same, as you have well observed and touched before. And
therefore, this strange and new devise must needs have some strange and
unaccustomed meaning: and God of his mercy grant, that it have not some strange
and unexpected event.

The danger of our Country by concealing the next heir.
In sight of all men, this is already evident, that never Country in the world
was brought into more apparent danger of utter ruin, then ours is at this day,
by pretense of this Statute. For whereas there is no Gentleman so mean in the
Realm, that cannot give a guess more or less, who shall be his next heir,
and his Tenants soon conjecture, what manner of person shall be their next
Lord: in the title of our noble Crown, whereof all the rest depends; neither
is her Majesty permitted to know or say, who shall be her next successor, nor
her subjects allowed to understand or imagine, who in right may be their future
Sovereign: An intolerable injury in a matter of so singular importance.

For (alas) what should become of this our native Country, if God should take
from us her most excellent Majesty (as once he will) and so leave us destitute
upon the sudden, Great inconveniences.
what should become of our lives, of our states, and of our whole Realm or
government? can any man promise himself one day longer, of rest, peace,
possession, life or liberty within the land, then God shall lend us her Majesty
to reign over us? Which albeit, we do and are bound to wish that it may be
long: yet reason tells us, that by course of nature, it cannot be of any
great continuance, and by a thousand accidents it may be much shorter. And
shall then our most noble Commonwealth and Kingdom, which is of perpetuity,
and must continue to our selves and our posterity, hang only upon the life of
her Highness alone, well stricken in years, and of no great good health, or
robustious and strong complexion?

Sir Christopher Hattons Oration.
I was within hearing some six or seven years ago, when Sir Christopher
Hatton, in a very great assembly, made an eloquent oration (which after I wene
was put in print) at the pardoning and delivery of him from the gallows, that
by error (as was thought) had discharged his piece upon her Majesty's Barge,
and hurt certain persons in her Highness presence. And in that Oration he
declared and described very effectually, what inestimable damage had ensued to
the Realm, if her Majesty by that or any other means should have been taken
from us. He set forth most lively before the eyes of all men, what division,
what dissension, what bloodshed had ensued, and what fatal dangers were most
certain to fall upon us, whenever that doleful day should happen: wherein
no man should be sure of his life, of his goods, of his wife, of his children:
no man certain whether to fly, whom to follow, or where to seek repose or
protection.

And as all the hearers there present did easily grant that he therein said
truth, and far less then might have been said in that behalf, things
standing as they do: so many one (I trow) has heard these words proceed from
a Counselor, that had good cause to know the state of his own Country,
entered into this cogitation, what punishment they might deserve then,
Intolerable Treasons.
at the whole State and Commonwealths hands, who first by letting her Majesty
from marriage, and then by procuring this Statute of dissembling the next
inheritour, had brought their Realm into so evident and inevitable dangers?
for every one well considered and weighed with himself, that the thing which
yet only let these dangers and miseries set down by Sir Christopher, must
necessarily one day fail us all, that is, the life of her Majesty now present:
and then (say we) how falls it out, that so general a calamity as must needs
overtake us ere it be long (and may, for any thing we know to morrow next) is
not provided for, as well as foreseen.

Is there no remedy, but that we must willingly and wittingly run into our
own ruin? and for the favor or fear of some few aspirours, betray our
Country, and the blood of so many thousand innocents as live within the land?

The miseries to follow upon her Majesty's death.
For tell me (good Sirs) I pray you, if her Majesty should die to morrow next
(whose life God long preserve and bless,) but if she should be taken from us,
(as by condition of nature and humane frailty she may) what would you do?
which way would you look? or what head or part knew any good subject in the
Realm to follow? I speak not of the conspiratours, for I know they will be
ready and resolved whom to follow: but I speak of the plain, simple, and
well-meaning subject, who following now the utter letter of this fraudulent
statute, (fraudulent I mean in the secret conceit of the cunning aspirours:)
shall be taken at that day upon the sudden, and being put in a maze by the
unexpected contention about the Crown, shall be brought into a thousand
dangers, both of body and goods, which now are not thought upon by them who are
most in danger of the same. And this is for the Commonwealth and Country.

The danger to her Majesty b^ ^his statute.
But unto her Majesty, for whose good and safety the statute is only pretended
to be made, no doubt but that it brings far greater dangers then any devise
that they have used besides. For hereby under color of restraining the claims
and tit^es of true successors, (whose endeavors notwithstanding, are commonly
more calm and moderate then of usurpers,) they make unto themselves, a mean
to forster and set forward their own conspiracy without controlement: seeing
no man of might may oppose himself against them, but with suspicion, that he
means to claim for himself. And so they being armed on the one side, with
their authority and force of present fortune, and defended on the other side,
by the pretense of the statute: they may securely work and plot at their
pleasure, as you have well proved before that they do. And whenever their
grounds and fouxndations shall be ready, it cannot be denied, but that her
Majesty's life lies much at their discretion, to take it, or use it, to their
best commodity: (and there is no doubt but they w^ll,) as such men are wont to
do in such affairs. Marry one thing stands not in their powers so
absolutely, and that is, to prolong her Majesty's days, or favor toward
themselves, at their pleasures: whereof it is not unlike but they will have due
consideration, least perhaps upon any sudden accident, they might be found
unready.

They have good care thereof I can assure you, Gentleman.
(quoth the Gentleman) and mean noc to be prevented by any accident, or other
mishap whatsoever: they will be ready for all events: and for that cause, they
hasten so much their preparations at this day, more then ever before: The
hastening of the Conspiratours.
by sending out their spies and sollicitours everywhere, to prove and confirm
their friends, by delivering their common watchword: by complaining on all
hands of our Protestants Bishops and Clergy, and of all the present state of
our irreformed Religion, (as they call it:) by amplifying only the danger of
Papists and Scottish faction: by giving out openly that now her Majesty is past
hope of Childbirth; and consequently, seeing God has given no better success
that way in two Women one after the other: it were not convenient (say they)
that another of that sex should ensue, with high commendation of the Law
Salick in France, whereby women are forbidden to succeed. Which speech, though
in show it be delivered against the Queen o^ Scots, and other of King Henr^ the
seventh his l^ne, that descend of Sister: yet all men see that it touches as
well the disabling of her Majesty, that is present, as others to come: and so
tends directly ^o M^turation of the principal purpose, which I have decla^e^
(...).

Here said I, for ^he rest which you speak of, besides the Watch word,
Scholar.
it is common and every where ^reated in t^lke among them: but yet for the
W^^ch word it self (for that you name it) I think (Sir) many kn^w i^ not, The
Watchword or the Conspiratours.
it I were the first that told yo^ ^he sto^y, as perch^nce I was. For in truth
I came to it by a rare h^p (as then I told you) the thing being ut^ered and
expounded by a Baron of their own faction, to another Noble man of the same
degree and religion, though not of the same opinion in these affairs. And for
that I am requested not to utter the second, who told it me in secret, I must
also spare the name of the first, which otherwise I would not; nor the time and
place where he uttered the same.

Lawyer.
To this (said the Lawyer) you do well in that: but yet I beseech you, let me
know this Watch word (if there be any such) for mine instruction and help
when need shall require. For I assure you that this Gentleman's former speech of
halters has so terrified me, as if any should come and ask, or feel my
inclination in these matters, I would answer them fully to their good
contentment, if I knew the Watchword whereby to know them. For of all things,
I love not to be hanged for quarrels of Kingdoms.

This Watchword is, (said I) Whether you be settled or no? Scholar. Are you
^atled.
and if you answer yea, and seem to understand the meaning thereof: then are
you known to be of their faction, and so to be accounted and dealt withal
for things to come. But if you stagger or doubt in answering, as if you knew
not perfectly the mystery, (as the Nobleman my good Lord did, imagining that it
had been meant of his religion, which was very well known to be good, and
settled in the Gospel) then are you discried thereby, either not to be of their
side, or else to be but a Punie not well instructed; and consequently, A great
mystery.
he that moves you the question, will presently break off that speech, and
turn to some other talk, until afterward occasion be given to persuade you,
or else instruct you better in that affair.

Ma^ry the Noble man, whereof I spoke before, perceiving by the demanding, that
there was some mystery in covert, under the question: took hold of the words,
and would not suffer the propounder to slip away (as he endeavored) but with
much entreaty brought him at length to expound the full meaning and purpose of
the riddle. And this was the first occasion (as I think) whereby this secret
came abroad. Albeit afterward at the public Communions, which were made
throughout so mamany Shires, the matter became more common: especially among
the stranxgers that inhabit (as you know) in great numbers with us at this
day. All which (as they say) are made most assured to this faction, and ready
to assist the same with great forces at all occasions.

Good Lord (quoth the Lawyer) how many mysteries and secrets be there abroad in
the world, Lawyer.
whereof we simple men know nothing, and suspect less. This Watchword should
I never have imagined: and for the great and often assemblies, Assemblies at
Communions.
under pretense of Communions, though of themselves, and of their own nature,
they were unaccustomed, and consequently subject to suspicion, yet I did never
conceive so far forth as now I do: Strangers within the Land.
as neither of the lodging and entertaining of so many strangers in the Realm,
whereof our Artizans do complain everywhere. But now I see the reason
thereof, which (no doubt) is founded upon great policy for the purpose. And by
this also I see that the house of Huntington presses far forward for the
game, and should^eth near the goal to lay hands upon the same. Which to tell
you plainly, likes me but a little: both in respect of the good will I bear
to the whole Line of King Henry, which hereby is like to be dispossessed; as
also for the misery which I do foresee, must necessarily ensue upon our
Country, if once the challenge of Huntington take place in our Realm. The
peril of our Country if Huntingtons claim take place.
Which challenge being derived from the title of ^la^ence only in the House of
York, before the union of the two great Houses: raises up again the old
contention between the Families of Yo^ke and Lancaster, wherein so much
English blood was spilt in times past, and much more like to be powered out
now, if the same contention should be set on foot again. Seeing that to the
controversy of Titles, would be added also the controversy of Religion,
which of all other differences is most dangerous.

Gentleman.
Sir (quoth the Gentleman) now you touch a matter of consequence indeed, and
such as the very naming thereof makes my heart to shake and tremble. I
remember well what Philip Cominus sets down in his History of our Countries
calamity, by that contention of those two Houses, distinguished by the Red Rose
and the White: but yet both in their Arms might justly have borne the color
of Red, The Red Rose and ^he White.
with a fiery sword in a black field; to signify the abundance of blood and
mortality which ensued in our Country, by that most woeful and cruel
contention.

I will not stand here to set down the particulars, observed and gathered by
the foresaid author, though a stranger, which for the most part he saw
himself, while he lived about the Duke of Burgundy, and King Jews of France,
of that time: namely the pitiful description of diverse right Noble men of our
Realm, who besides all other miseries, The misery of England by the contention
between York and Lan^aster.
were driven to beg openly in foreign Countries, and the like. Mine own
observation in reading over our Country affairs, is sufficient to make me
abhor the memory of that time, and to dread all occasion that may ^ead us to
the like in time to come: seeing that in my judgment, neither the Civil
wars of Marius and Silla, or of Pompey and Caesar among the Romans, nor yet
the Guelphians and Gibilines among the Italians, Guelphians and Gibil^ne^
did ever work so much woe, as this did to our poor Country. Wherein by
reason of the contention of York and Lancaster, were foughten sixteen or
seventeen pitched fields, in less then an hundred years. That is, from the
eleventh or twelfth year of King Richard the second his reign, (when this
controversy first began to bud up) unto the thirteenth year of K. Henry the
seventh. At what time by cutting off the chief titler of Huntingtons house, to
wit, young Edward Plantaginet Earl of Warwick, Edward Plantaginet Earl of
Warwick.
Son and Heir to George, Duke of Clarence; the contention most happily was
quenched and ended, wherein so many fields (as I have said) were foughten
between Brethren and Inhabitants of our own Nation. And therein, and otherwise
only about the same quarrel, were sla^^ murdered, and made away, about nine or
ten Kings, and Kings Sons; besides above forty Earls, Marquesses, and Dukes
of name: but many more Lords, Knights, and great Gentlemen and Captains: and
of the Common people without number, and by particular conjecture very near
two hundred thousand. The Battle by Ta^^^ster on P^lme Sunday, An. 1460.
For that in one Battle, fought by King Edward the fourth, there are recorded
to be slain on both parts, five and thirty thousand seven hundred and eleven
persons, besides others wounded and taken prisoners, to be put to death
afterward, at the pleasure of the Conqueror: at diverse Battles after, ten
thousand slain at a Battle. And in those of Barnet and Tukesbury, fought both
in one year.

The danger of Huntingtons claim, to the Re^lme, and to her Majesty.
This suffered our afflicted Country in those days, by this unfortunate and
deadly contention, which could never be ended, but by the happy conjunction of
those two Houses t^gether, in Henry the seventh: neither yet so (as appears
by Chronicle) until (as I have said) the state had cut off the issue male o^
the Duke of Clarence, who was cause of diverse peril^ to King Henry the seven^h,
though he were in prison* By whose Sister the faction of Huntin^ton at thi^
day, does seek to raise up the same contention again, with far greater
danger both to the Rea^m^ and to her Majesty that now reigns, then ever
before.

And for the Realm it is evident, by that it givet^ room to strangers,
Competitours of the House o^ Lancaster: better able to maintain their own
titl^ by sword, then ever was any of that lineage before t^em. And for her
Majesty's peril present, it is nothing hard to conjectur^: seeing the same
title in the foresaid Earl of Warwick, was so dangerous an^ troublesome to
her Grandfather (by whom she holds) as he was feign twi^^ to take arm^s in
defense of his right, against the said title, which was in those days
preferred and advanced by the friend^ of Clarence, before that of Henry: as
also this of Huntington is at this day, by his faction, before that of her
Majesty though never so unjustly.

Touching Huntingtons title, before her Majesty, Lawyer.
(quoth the Lawyer) I will say nothing: because in reason, I see not by what
pretense in the World, he may thrust himself so far forth: seeing her
Majesty is descend^d, not only of the House of Lancaste, How Huntington makes
hi^ tit^e before her Majesty.
but also before him most apparent^y from the House of York it self, as from
the eldest Daughter of King Edw^rd the fourth, being the eldest Brother of that
House. Whereas Huntington claims only by the Daughter of George Duke of
Clarence, the younger Bro^her. Marry yet I must confess, that if the Earl of
Warwicks title were better then that of King Henry the seventh, (which is most
false, though many attempted to defend the same by sword:) then has Hunt^ngton
some wrong at this day by her Majesty. Albeit in very truth, the The most of
Hu^tingtons Ancest^^s by who^ he make^h ^i^le, a^tain^ed of Treason.
at^aints of so many of his Ancestors by whom he cla^m^th, would answer him
also sufficiently in that behalf, if his title were otherwise allowable.

But I know besides this, The f^mous device ^f king Richard the third, ^^lowed
by Hu^tington.
they have another fetch of King Richard the third, whereby he would needs
prove h^s elder Brother King Edwa^d to be a Bastard: and consequently his
whole line, as well male as female to be void. Which devise though it be
ridiculous, and was at that time when it was first invented: yet, as Richard
found at that time a Doctor Shaw, that shamed not to publish and defend the
same, at Paul's Cross in a Sermon: and John of Northumberland my Lord of
L^yce^^ers Father found out diverse Preachers in his time, Anno 1. Mariae.
to set up the title of Suffolk, and to debase the right of K. Henry's
daughter, both in London, Cambridge Oxford, and other places, most apparently
against all Law and reason: so I doubt not but these men would find out also
both Shawes, Sands, and others, to set out the title of Clare^ce, before the
whole interest of King Henry the seventh and his posterity, A point to be no^ed
by her Majesty.
if occasion served. Which is a point of importance to be considered by her
Majesty; albeit for my part, I mean not not now to stand thereupon, but only
upon that other of the House of Lancaster, as I have said.

For as that most honorable, lawful, and happy conjunction of the two
adversary Houses, in King Henry the seventh and his Wife, The joining of both
houses.
made an end of the shedding of English blood within it self, and brought us
that most desired peace, which ever since we have enjoyed, by the reign of
their two most noble issue: so the plot that now is in hand, for the cutting
off the residue of that issue, and for recalling back of the whole Title to
the House of York again; is like to plung us deeper then ever in civil
discord, and to make us the bait of all foreign Princes: seeing there be among
them at this day, The Line of Portug^ll.
some of no small power (as I have said) who pretend to be the next heirs by
the House of Lancaster: and consequently, are not like to give over or abandon
their own right, if once the door be opened to contention for the same, by
disanulling the Line of King Henry the seventh: wherein only the keys of all
concord remain knit together.

And albeit I know well that such as be of my Lord of Huntingtons party, will
make small account of the Title (...) Lancaste^, as less rightful a great
deal then that of York, (and I for my part mean not greatly to avow the
same, as now it is placed, being my self no favourer of foreign Titles:) yet
indifferent men have to consider how it was taken in times past, and how it may
again in time to come, if contention should arise: how many Noble personages
of our Realm did offer themselves to die in defense thereof: The old
estimation of the House of Lancaster.
how many Oaths and Laws were given and received throughout the Realm for
maintenance of the same, against the other House of York for ever: how many
worthy Kings were crowned, and reigned of that House and Race; to wit, the
four most Noble Henry's, one after another; the fourth, the fifth, the sixth,
and the seventh: who both in number, government, sanctity, courage, and feats
of arms, were nothing inferior (if not superior) to those of the other House
and Line of York, after the division between the Families.

It is to be considered also as a special sign of the favor and affection
of our whole Nation unto that Family: that Henry Earl of Richmond, Henry Earl
of Richmond.
though discending but of the last Son, and third Wife of John of Gaunt, Duke
of Lancaster, was so respected for that only by the universal Realm: as they
inclined wholly to call him from banishment, and to make him King with the
deposition of Richard, which then ruled of the House of York, upon condition
only, that the said Henry should take to Wife a Daughter of the contrary
Family: so great was in those days the affection of English hearts toward the
Line of Lancaster, for the great worthiness of such Kings as had reigned of
that Race, how good or bad soever their Title were: which I stand not here at
this time to discuss, but only to insinuate what party the same found in our
Realm in times past; and consequently, how extreme dangerous the contention
for the same may be hereafter: The Line of Portugal.
especially, seeing that at this day the remainder of that Title is pretended
to rest wholly in a stranger, whose power is very great. Which we Lawyers are
wont to esteem as a point of no sma^l importance, for justifying of any man's
title ^o a Kingdom.

Scholar.
You Lawyers want not reason in that Sir (quoth I) howsoever you want right: for
if you will examine the succession of governements, from the beginning of the
W^rld until this day, either among Gentile, The sword of great f^rce ^o
ju^tifie the title of a kingdom.
Jew, or Christian people, you shall find that the sword ha^h ^eene always
b^tter th^n half the title, to get, est^bli^h, or mainta^ne a Kingdom: which
makes (...) ^h^ ^ore apalled to hear you discourse in such sort of new
contentions, and foreign titles, accompanied with such power and strength of
the titlers, which cannot be but infinitely dangerous and fatal to our
Realm, if once it come to act^on; both for the division that is like to be at
home, and the variety of part^es from ab^oad. For as the Prince who^ you
signify, will not fail (by all likelihood) to pursue his title with all
forces that he can make, if occasion were offered: so reason of state and
policy will enforce other Princes adjoining, Great dangers.
to let and hinder him therein what they can: and so by this means shall we
become Juda and Isr^el among our selves, one killing and vexing the other with
the sword: and to foreign Princes we shall be, as the Island of Salamina was in
old time to the Athenians and Megatians: and as the Island of Cicilia was
afterward to the Grecians, Carthaginians, and Romans: and as in our days, the
Kingdom of Naples has been to the Spaniards, Frenchmen, Germans, and
Venetians; That is, a bait to feed upon, and a game to fight for.

Wherefore, I beseech the Lord, to avert from us all occasions of such
miseries. And I pray you Sir, for that we are fallen into the mention of these
matters, to take so much pains as to open unto me the ground of these
controversies, so long now quiet between York and Lancaster: seeing they are
now like to be raised again. For albeit in general I have heard much
thereof, yet in particular, I either conceive not, or remember not the
foundation of the same: and much less the state of their several titles at
this day, for that it is a study not properly pertaining unto my profession.

The controversy between the Houses of York and Lancaster (quoth the Lawyer)
took his actual beginning in the issue of King Edward the third, The beginning
of the controve^sie betwixt York and Lancaster.
who died somewhat more then two hundred years agone: but the occasion,
pretense, or cause of that quarrel, began in the children of King Henry the
third, who died an hundred years before that, and left two Sons; Edward, who
was King after him, by the name of Edward the first, and was Grandfather to
Edward the third: and Edmond (for his deformity called Crookebacke) Earl of
Lancaster, and beginner of that House, whose inheritance afterward in the
fourth descent, fell upon a Daughter named Blanch, who was married to the
fourth Son of King Edward the third, named John of Gaunt, for that he was borne
in the City of Gaunt in Flanders, and so by this his first wife, he became
Duke of Lancaster, and heir of that House. And for that his Son Henry of
Bolingbrooke (afterward called King Henry the fourth) pretended among other
things, that Edmond Crookeback, Edmond Crookback beginner of the House of
Lancaster.
great Grandfather to Blanch his mother, Blanch.
was the elder Son of King Henry the third, and unjustly put by the
inheritance of the Crown, John of Gaunt.
for that he was Crook-backed and deformed: he took by force the Kingdom
from Richard the second, Nephew to King Edward the third, by his first Son;
and placed the same in the House of Lancaster, How the Kingdom was first
brought to the House of Lancaster.
where it remained for three whole discents, until afterward, Edward Duke of
York descended of John of Gaunts younger brother, making claim to the Crown
by title of his Grandmother, that was heir to Lionel, Duke of Clarence, John
of Gaunts elder Brother, took the same by force from Henry the sixth, of the
House of Lancaster, and brought it back again to the House of York: where it
continued with much trouble in two Kings only, until both Houses were joined
together in King Henry the seventh, and his noble issue.

Hereby we see how the issue of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, fourth Son
to King Edward the third, pretended right to the Crown by Edmond Crookebacke,
before the issue of all the other three Sons of Edward the third, albeit they
were the elder Brothers, whereof we will speak more hereafter. Now John of
Gaunt though he had many children, The issue of John of Gaunt.
yet had he four only, of whom issue remain, two Sons and two Daughters.
The first Son was Henry of Bolingbrooke, Duke of Lancaster, who took the
Crown from King Richard the second, his Unkles Son, as has been said; and
first of all planted the same in the House of Lancaster: where it remained in
two discents after him, that is, in his Son Henry the fifth, and in his Nephew
Henry the sixth, who was afterward destroyed, together with Henry Prince of
Wales, his only Son and Heir, and consequently all that Line of Henry
Bolingb^ooke extinguished, by Edward the fourth of the House of York.

The other Son of John of Gaunt, was John, Duke of Somers^t, The pedigree of
king Henry the seventh.
by Katherine Sfinsford, his third wife: which John had issue another John, and
he, Margaret his Daughter and Heir, who being married to Edmond Tyder, Earl
of Richmond, had issue Henry Earl of Richmond, who after was named King Henry
the seventh, whose Line yet endures.

The two Daughters of John of Gaunt were married to Portugal and Castile: that
is, The two Daughters married to Portugal and Castile.
Philip borne of Blanch, Heir to Edmond Crookeback, as has been said, was
married to John King of Portugal, of whom is descended the King that now
possesses Portugal, and the other Princes which have or may make title to the
same: and Katherin borne of Constan^e, Heir of Castile, was married back
again to Henry King of Castile in Spain, of whom King Philip is also
descended. So that by this, we see where the remainder of the House of
Lancaster rests, if the Line of King Henry the seventh were extinguished: and
what pretext foreign Princes may have to subdue us, if my Lord of Huntington
either now, Foreign titles.
or after her Majesty's days, will open to them the door, by shutting out the
rest of King Henry's Line, and by drawing back the title to the only House of
York again: which he pretends to do, upon this that I will now declare.

King Edward the third, The issue of king Edwar^ the 3.
albeit he had many children, yet five only will we speak of at this time:
Whereof three were elder then J^hn of Gaunt, and one younger. The first of the
elder was named Edward the black Prince, who died before his Father, leaving
one only Son named Richard, who afterward being King, and named Richard the
second, was deposed without issue, and put to death by his Cousin germain, named
Henry Bolingbrooke, Duke of Lancaster, Son to John of Gaunt, as has been
said; and so there ended the Line of King Edwards first Son.

King Edwards second Son, was William of Hatf^^ld, that died without issue.

His third Son was Leonell Duke of Clarence, whose only Daughter and Heir
called Ph^^ip, was married to Edmond Mortimer Earl o^ Marc^: and after that,
Anne ^he Daughter and Heir of Mortimer, was married to Richard Plantagi^et
Duke of York, Son and Heir to Edmond of Lang^^y, the first Duke of York^:
which Edmond was the fifth Son of King Edward the third, Two Edmonds the two
beginner^ of the two Houses of Lancaste^ and York.
and younger Brother to John of Gaunt And this Edmond of Lan^ley may be called
the first beginner of the H^use of York: even as Edmond Crookback, the
beginner of the House of Lancaster.

This Edmond Langley, then having a Son named Richard, that married Anne
Mortimer, sole Heir to Leonell Duke of Clarence, joined two Lines and two
Titles in one: I mean the Line of Leonell, and of Edmond Langley, who were (as
has bin said) the third and the fifth Sons to King Edward the third. And for
this cause, the child that was borne of this marriage, named after his Father
Richard Plantaginet, Duke of York, seeing himself strong, and the first Line
of King Edward the thirds eldest Son to be extinguished in the death of King
Richard the second: The claim and title of York.
and seeing William of Hatfield the second Son dead likewise without iss^e:
made demand of the Crown for the House of York, by the title of Leonell the
third Son of King Edward. And albeit he could not obtain the same in his
days, for that he was slain in a Battle against King Henry the sixth at
Wakefield: yet his Son Edward got the same, and was called by the name of
King Edward the fourth.

The issue of king Ed^ard the fourth.
This King at his death left diverse children, as namely two Sons, Edward the
fifth and his Brother, who after were both murdered in the Tower, as shall be
showed: and also five Daughters: to wit, Elizabeth, Cicily, Anne, Katherine,
and Briget. Whereof, the first was married to Henry the seventh. The last
became a Nun, and the other three were bestowed upon diverse other husbands

He had al^o two Brothers: The Duke of Clarence attainted* by Parliament.
the first was called George Duke of ^larence* who afterward upon his deserts
(as is to be supposed,) was put to death in Callis, by commandment of the
King, and his attainder allowed by Parliam^nt. And this man left behind him a
Son, named Edward Earl of Warwick, put to death afterward without issue, by
King Henry the seventh, and a Daughter named Margaret* Countess^ of ^alis^ury,
who was married to a mean Gentleman named Richar^ Poole, by whom she had issue
Cardinal Poole, that died without marriage; Huntington^ title by the Duke of
Clarence.
and Henry Poole that was attainted and executed ^n King Henry the eight his
time; (as also her self was) and this Henry Poole left a Daughter married
afterward to the Earl of Huntington, by whom this Earl that now is makes
title to the Crown. And this is the effect of my Lord of Huntingtons title.

The second Brother of King Edward the fourth, was Richard Duke of G^ocester,
King Richard the third.
who after the Kings death, caused his two Sons to be murdered in the Tower,
and took the Kingdom to himself. And afterward he being slain by King Henry
the seventh at Bos^^orth-field, left no issue behind him Wherefore King Henry
the seventh descending as has bin showed of the House of Lancaster, The happy
conjunction of the two Houses.
by John of Gaunts last Son and third Wife, and taking to Wife Lady
^lizabeth, eldest daughter of King Edward the fourth, of the House of York:
joined most happily the two Families together, and made an end of all
controversies about the title.

Now King Henry the seventh had issue three Children: of whom remains
posterity. The issue of King Henry the seventh.
First, Henry the eighth, of whom is descended our Sovereign, her Majesty that
now happily reigns, and is the last that remains alive of that first Line.
The Line and Title of Scotland by Margaret, eldest Daughter to King Henry ^he 7.
Secondly, he had two Daughters: whereof the first named Margaret, was married
twice; first to James King of Scotland, from whom are directly descended the
Queen of Scotland that now lives, and her Son: and King James being dead,
Margaret was married again to Archihald Douglas Earl of Anguish: by whom she
had a Daughter named Margaret, which was married afterward to Matthew Steward,
Earl of Len^x, whose Son Charles Steward was married to Elizab^th Candish,
Daughter to the present Countess of Shrewsbury, and by her has left his only
Heir, Arb^^^^.
a little Daughter named Arbella, of whom you have heard some speech before.
And this is touching the Line of Scotland, descending from the first and eldest
Daughter of King Henry the seventh.

The Line and Title of Suffolk by Mary, second daughter to King ^enry the 7.
The second Daughter of King Henry the seventh called Mary, was twice married
also: first to the King of France, by whom she had no issue: and after his
death to Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, by whom she had two Daughters; that
is, Francis, of which the Children of my Lord of Hartford do make their claim:
and Elenor, by whom the issue of the Earl of Darby pretends right, as shall
be declared. For that Francis the first Daughter of Charles Brando4 by the
Queen of France, was married to the Marquess of Dorset, who after Charles
Brandons death, was made Duke of Suffolk in right of his W^fe, The issue of
Francis, eldest Daughter to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.
and was beheaded in Queen Mary's time, for his conspiracy with my Lord of
Leycesters Father. And she had by this man three Daughters: that is, Jane, that
was married to my Lord of Leycesters Brother, and proclaimed Queen after King
Edwards death, The issue of Francis eldest daughter to Charles Brandon Duke of
Suffolk.
for which both she and her husband were executed: Katherine the second
D^ughter, who had two Sons, yet living by the Earl of Hartford: and M^ry the
third D^ugter, which left no Children.

The other Daughter of Cha^l^s Brandon by the Queen of France called Elenor,
The issue of Elenor second daughter to Charles Brandon.
was married to Georg^ Cliff^rd Earl of Cumberland, who left a Daughter by her
named Ma^g^re^, married to the Earl of Darby, which yet lives, and has
issue. And this is the title of the H^use of Suffolk, descended from the
second Daughter of K. Henry the seventh, married (as has been showed) to
Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk. And by this, you may see also how many there
be, who do think their titles to be far before that of my Lord of Huntington^,
if either r^ght, l^w, reason, or consideration of home affairs may take place
in our Realm: or if not, yet you cannot but imagine how many great Princes and
Potentat^s abroad, are like to join and buckle with Hunting^ons Line for the
preeminence: ^f once the matter fall again to contention by excluding the Line
of King Henry the seventh, which God forbid.

Truly Sir (quoth I) I well perceive that my Lords turn is not so nigh as I
had thought, Scholar.
Huntington bebehind many other titles.
whether he exclude the Line of King Henry, or no^ for if he exclude that, then
must he enter the Combat with foreign titlers of the House of Lancaster: and
if he ^xclude it not, then in all appearance of reason and in Law to (as you
have said) the succession of the two D^ughters of King Hen^y the seventh (which
you dist^ngu^sh by the two names of Scotland and Suffolk) must needs be as
clearly before him and his L^ne, that decended only from Edward the fourth his
Brother, as the Queens title that new reigns is before him. For th^^ ^oth
Scotland, Suffolk and her Majesty do hold all by one found^tion, which is the
union of both Houses and Titles together, in King Henry the seventh her
Majesty's Grandfather.

Gentleman.
That is true (quoth the Gentleman) and eviden^ enough in every man's eye; and
therefore no doubt: but as that much is meant ^g^inst her Majesty, if oc4^sion
serve, ^s against the rest that hold by the same ^itle. Albeit her M^iesti4s
state (the Lord be praised) be such at thi^ (...), as it is not saf^y to
pretend so much against her, as against the rest, whatsoever be meant. And that
in truth, more should be meant against her h^ghnes, the^ against all ^he rest:
there is this reason; for that her Majesty by her present possession lets
more their desires, then all the rest together with their future pretenses. But
as I have said, it is not safety for them, The policy of the conspiratours for
the deceiving of her Majesty.
nor yet good p^l^cy to declare openly, what they mean against her Majesty. It
is the best way for the p^esent to show down the rest, and to leave her
Majesty for the last ^low and upshot to their g^me. For which c^use, they will
^eeme to make great difference at this day, between her Majesty's title and
the rest, that descend in likewise from King Henr^, the seventh: avowing the
one, and disallow^ng the other. Albeit, my Lord of Leicesters Father, preferred
that of Suffolk, when (...) was, before this of her M^j^sty, and co^pelle^ the
wh^le Realm to swear thereunto. Such is the variable policy of men, that
serve the time, or rather that serve themselves, of all times, for their
purposes.

Scholar.
I remember (quoth I) that time of ^he Duke, and was present my self, at some
of his Proclamations for that purpose: wherein my Lord his Son that now
lives: ^eing then a doer, (as I can tell he was:) I marvile how he can deal
so contrary now: preferring not only her Majesty's title before that of
Suffolk (whereof I wonder less^ because it is more gainful to him, Leycesters
variability.
) but also another much further of. Bu^ you have signified the cause, in that
the times are change^, and other bargains are in hand of more importance for
him. Wherefo^e leaving this to be considered by others whom it concerns, I
beseech you, Sir, (for that I know, your worship has beeene much conversant
among their frien^s and favorers) to tell me what are the bars and lets
which they do allege, why the house of Sco^land and Suffolk descend^d of king
Henry the seventh his daughters, should not succeed in the Crown of England
after her Majesty, who ended the line of the same king by his son; for in my
sight the matter appears v^ry plain.

They want not pretenses of bars and lets against them all (quoth the
Gentleman) which I will l^y down in order, Gentleman.
as I have heard them alleged. First, Bars pretended against the cla^m of
Scotland and Suffolk.
in the line of Scotland there are three persons as you know, that may pretend
right, that is the Queen and her son by the first marriage of Margaret, and
Arbella by the second. And against the first marriage, I hear nothing
affirmed; but against the two persons proceeding thereof, I hear them allege
three stops, one for that they are strangers born out of the land, and
cons^quently incap^ble of inheritance within the same; Against the Queen of
Scotland and her son.
another for that by a speci^l testament of king H. 8. authorized by 2.
several p^rliam. they are excluded; 3 for that they are enemies to the
religion now among us and therefore to be debarred.

Against the second marriage of Ma^g^ret with A^chibald Douglas wh^^eof A^bella
is descended, Against Arbella.
they allege, that the said Archibald had a former wife at the time of that
marriage, which lived long after: and so neither that marriage lawful, nor the
issue thereof legitimate.

The same bar they have against all the house and Line of Suffolk, for first
they say, that Charl^s B^andon Duke of Suffolk, had a known wife alive when
he married Mary Queen of France, and consequently, that neither the Lady
Frances nor Elenor, borne of that marriage, can be lawfully borne. And this is
all, I can hea^e them say against the succession of the Coun^esse of Darby
descended of Elenor. Against Darby.
But against my Lord of Hartfords ch^ldren, that came from Fran^es the eldest
daughter, I hear them allege two or three bastardies more besides this of the
first marriage. Against the children of Hartford.
For first, they affirm that Henry Marquess Dorset, when he married the Lady
Frances, had to wife the old Earl of Arundels sister, who lived both then and
many years after, and had a provision out of his living to her dying day^
whereby that marriage could no way be good. Secondly that the lady Katherine,
daughter to the said Lady Frances, by the Marquis (by whom the Earl of Hartford
had his children) was lawfully married to the Earl of Pembroke that now
lives, and consequently, could have no lawful issue by any other during his
life. 3ly. that the said Katherine wa^ never lawfully married to the said Earl
Hartford, but bare him those children as his Concubine, which (^s they say) is
defined and registered in the Archb. of Canterburies court, upon due examination
taken by order of her Majesty that now reigns, and this is in effect so much
as I have heard them all aledge, about their affars.

It is much (quoth I) that you have said, if it may be all proved. Scholar.
Marry yet by the way, I cannot but smile to hear my Lord of Ley^ester allow
of so many bastardies now upon the issue of Lady Frances, whom in time past,
when Jane her eldest daughter was married to his brother, Leycesters dealing
with the house of Suffolk.
he advanced in legitimation before both the daughters of king Henry the eight.
But to the purpose: I would gladly know what grounds of verity these
allegations have, and how far in truth they may stop from inheritance: for in
deed I never heard them so distinctly alleged before.

Whereto answe^ed the Gentleman, Gentleman.
that our friend the L^wy^r could best reso^ve that, if it pleased him to
sp^ake without his fee: though in some points alleged every other man (quoth
he) that knows the state and common government of England, may easily give
his judgment also. And i^ the case of bastardy, Bastardy.
if the matter may be proved, there is no d^fficulty, but that no right to
inheritance can justly be pretended: Foreign bi^th.
as also (perhaps) in the case of foreign birth, though in this I am not so
cunning: but yet I see by experience, that forrainers borne in other lands, can
hardly come and claim inheritance in England, albeit, to the contrary, I have
heard great and long disp^tes, but such as indeed passed ^y capacity. And if it
might please our friend here present to expound the thing unto us more clearly,
I for my part would gladly bestow the hearing, and that with attention.

To this answered the Lawyer, I will gl^dly, Lawye^.
si^, tell you my mind in any thing that it shall please you demand: and much
more in this matter, wherein by occasion of often conference I am somewhat
perfect. The imped^ments which these men allege against the succession of king
Henry the 8. his sisters, are of two kinds, as you see: The one known and
allowed in our law, Bastardie, la^^^l stops.
as you have well said, if it may be proved; and that is bastardy: whereby they
seek to disable all the whole Line and race of Suffolk: as also Arbella of the
second and later house of Scotland. Whereof it is to small purp^se to speak any
thing here: seeing the whole controversy stands upon a matter of fact only
to be proved or improved by records and witnesses. Only this I will say, that
some of these bastardies, before named, are rife in many men's mouths, and
avowed by diverse that yet live: but let other men look to this, who have most
interest therein, and may be most damnified by them, if they fall out true. The
impediments against Scotland three in number.
The other impediments, which are alleged only against the Q^eene of Scots
and her (...), are in number three, ^s you recite them: th^^ is foreign birth,
king Henry's testament, and Religion: whereof ^ am content to say somewhat,
seeing you desire it: albeit there be so much published already in books of
diverse languages beyond the sea, as I am informed, concerning this matter, as
more cannot be said. But yet so much as I have heard pass among Lawyers my
betters, in conference of these affairs: I will not let to recite unto you,
with this proviso and protestation always, A protestation.
that what I speak, I speak by way of recital of other men's opinions: not
meaning my self to incur the statute of affirming or avowing any persons
title to the crown whatsoever.

Touching the first impediment of fo^raine birth.
First then touching foreign birth, there be some men in the world that will
say, that it is a common and general rule of our law, that no stranger at al
may inherit any thing by any means within the Land: which in truth I take to be
spoken without ground, in that general sense. For I could never yet come to
the sight of any such common or universal rule: and I know, that diverse
examples may be alleged in sundry cases to the contrary: and by that which is
expressly set down in the seventh (...) ninth years of king Ed. the 4. and in
the ^l^venth and fourteenth of Hen. the 4. it appear^^h plain^y that ^ stranger
may ^urchase lands in England, An Alien may purchase.
as also ^^herit by h^s wife, if he marry an inheritrix. Wherefore this common
rule (...) to be restra^ne^ from that generality, unto proper inheritance
only; The true Maxima against Alien^.
^n which sense I do easily grant, that our common Law has been of ancient,
and is at this day, that no person born out of the ^lleg^ance of the king of
England whose father and m^th^r were not of the same allegiance at the time of
his birth, shall be able to have or d^ma^d any heritage within the same
allegiance, as heir to any person. The statute of King Edward whence the
Maxima is gathered.
And this rule of our common L^w is gathered in these self same words of a
statute made in the 25. year of king Ed. the third, which indeed is the only
place of effect, that can be alleged out of our law against the inheritance of
strangers in such sense and cases as we ^re now to treat of.

And albeit now the common Law of our Country do run thus in general,
Reasons why the Scottish title is not let by the Maxima against Aliens.
yet will the^ friends of the Scottish claim affirm, that hereby that title
is nothing let or hindered at all tow^rds the Crown; and that for diverse
manifest and weighty reasons, whereof the princip^ll are these which ensue.

First, The first reason.
it is common and a general rule of our English laws, that no rule, Ax^ome or
M^xima of law (be it ^ever so general) can touch or bind the Crown, except
express mention be made thereof in the same; for that the king and crown
have great privilege and prerogative above the state and affairs of subjects,
and great differences allowed in points of law.

As for example, The rule of thirds.
it is a general and common rule of law, that the wife after the decease of
her husband, shall enjoy the third of his lands: but yet the Queen shall not
enjoy the third part of the Crown, after the Kings death: as well appears by
experience, and is to be seen by law, Anno 5. and 21. of Edward the third;
Tenant by courtesy.
and Anno 9. and 28. of Henry the sixth. Also it is a common rule, that the
husband shall hold his wives lands after her death, as tenant by courtesy
during his life, but yet it holds not in a Kingdom.

In like manner, it is a general and common rule, that if a man dye feased of
Land in Feesimple, having daughters and no son, his lands shall be divided by
equal portions among his daughters, Division among daughters.
which holds not in the Crown: but rather the eldest Daughter inherite^h the
whole, as if she were the issue male. So also it is a common rule of our law,
Executor^.
that the executor shall have all the goods and chattels of the Testator, but
not in the Crown. And so in many other cases which might be recited, it is
evident that the Crown has privilege above others, and cannot be subject to
rule, be it never so general, except express mention be made thereof in the
same law: as it is in the former place and a statute alleged: but rather to
the contrary (as after shall be showed) there is express exception, for the
prerogative of such as descend of Royal blood.

Their second reason is, for that the demand o^ title of a Crown cannot in
true sense be comprehended under the words of the former statute, The 2
reason. The Crown no such inher^tance as is meant in the statute.
forbidding aliens to demand heritage within the allegiance of England: and
that for two respects. The one, for that the Crown it self cannot be called
an heritage of allegiance, or within allegiance, for that it is holden of no
superior upon earth, but immediately from God himself: the second, for that
this statute treats only and means of inheritance by descent, as heir to
the same, (for I have showed before that Aliens may hold lands by purchase
within our Dominion) and then say they, The Crown a corporation.
the Crown is a thing incorporate, and descends not according to the common
course of other private inheritances: but goes by succession, as other
incorporations do. In sign whereof it is evident, that albeit the King be
more favored in all his doings, then any common person shall be, yet cannot
he avoid by law his grants and letters patents by reason of his nonage (as
other infants and common heirs under age may do) but always be said to be of
full age in respect of his Crown even as a Prior, Parson, Vicar, Deane, or
other person incorporate shall be, which cannot by any means in law be said
to be within age, in respect of their incorporations.

Which thing makes an evident difference in our case, from the meaning of the
former statute: for that a Prior, Deane, or Parson, being Aliens and no
Denizens, might always in time of peace demand lands in England, in respect of
their corporations, notwithstanding the said statute or common law against
Aliens, as appears by many book cases yet extant: as also by the statute
made in the time of King Richard the second, which was after the foresaid
statute of King Edward the third.

The third reason is, The ^. reason. The Kings issue excepted by name.
for that in the former statute it self of King E^ward, there are excepted
expressly from this general rule, Infantes du Roy, that is, the Kings off
spring or issue, as the word Infant does signify, both in France, Portugal,
Spain, and other Countries: and as the Latin word Liberi (which answers the
same) is taken commonly in the civil (...). Neither may we restrain the
french words of that Satute Infant^s du Roy, Liberorum. F. de. verb. sign.
to the kings children only of the first degree (as some do, for that the
barr^nnesse of our language does yield us no other word for the same) but
rather, that thereby are understood, as w^ll the nephews and other discendants
of the king or blood Royal, as his immediate children. For it were both
unreasonable and ridiculous to imagine that king Edward by this statute, would
go about to disinherit his own n^phews, if h^ should have any borne out of his
own allegiance (as easily he might at that time) his sons being much abroad
from England; and the black Prince, his eldest son having two children borne
b^yond the seas: and consequently, it is apparent, that this rule or maxim set
down against Aliens is no way to be stretched against the descendants of the
king or of the blood Royal.

Their fourth reason is, that the meaning of king Edward and his children
(living at such time as this statute was made) could not be, The fourth reason
The Kings meaning.
that any of their lineage or issue might be excluded in law, from inheritance
of their right to the Crown, by their foraine bir^h wheresoever. For
otherwise, it is not credible that they would so much have dispersed their own
blood in other Countries, as they did, by giving their daughters to strangers,
and other mean^s: The matches of England with foraigners.
as Leone^ the kings third son was married in Millan, and John of Gaunt the
fourth son, gave his two daughters, Philip and Katherine to Portugal and
C^st^le; and his niece Joan to the king of Scots: as Thomas of Woodstocke also
the youngest brother, married his two daughters, the one to the king of Spain,
and the other to Duke of Britain. Which no doubt (they being wise Princes, and
so near of the blood Royal) would never have done; if they had imagined that
hereby their issue should have lost all claim and title to the Crown of
England: and therefore it is most evident, that no such bar was then extant or
imagined

The fifth reason is, The fifth reason. Examples of forainers admited
that diverse persons born out of all English dominion and allegiance, both
before the Conquest and since, have bin admitted to the succession of our
Crown, as lawful inheritours, without any exception against them for their
foraine birth As before the Conquest is evident in young E^gar Etheling borne in
Hungary, and thence called home to inherit the Crown, by his great uncle
king Edward the Conf^ssor, Flores hist. Anno 1066.
with full consent of the whole Realm; the B. of Worcester being sent as
Ambassador to fetch him home, with his father named Edward the outlaw.

And since the Conquest, it appears plainly in king Stephen and king Henry
the second, both of them borne out of English dominions, and of Parents, that
at their birth, were not of the English allegiance; and yet were they both
admitted to the Crown. Young Arthur also Duke of Britain by his mother
Constance that matched with Geffray king Henry the seconds son, was declared
by king Richard his uncle, Pol. lib. 15. Flor. hist. 1208.
at his departure toward Jerusalem, and by the whole Realm, for lawful heir
apparent to the Crown of England, though he were borne in Britain out of
English allegiance; and so he was taken and judged by all the world at that
day: albeit, after king Richards death, his other uncle John, K. John a tyrant
most tyrannously took both his kingdom and his life from him. For which
notable injustice, he was det^sted of all men both abroad and at home; and most
apparently scourged by God, with grievous and manifold plagues, both upon
himself and the Realm, which yielded to his usurpation. So that by this also it
appears, what the practice of our Country has been from time to time in
this case of foreign birth: which practice is the best int^rpre^er of our
common English law: which depends especially, and most of all, upon custom:
nor can ^he adversary allege any one example to the contrary.

Their sixth, is of the judgment and sentence of King Henry the seventh, The 6.
reason. The judgment and sentence of K. Henry the seventh.
and of his Council: who being together in consultation, at a certain time
about the marriage of Margaret his eldest daugh^er into Scotland: some of his
Council moved this doubt, what should ensue, if by chance the kings issue male
should fail, and so the succession devolve to the heirs of the said Margaret,
as now it does? Wh^reunto that w^se and most prudent Prince made answer: that
if any such event should be, it could not be prejudicial^ to Engl^nd, being the
bigger part, but rather beneficial for that it should draw Scotland to
England: that is, the lesser to the more: even as in times past it happened in
Normandy, Aquitaine, and some other Provinces. Which answer appeased all doubts
and gave singular content to those of his Council, as Polidore writes, that
lived at that time, and wrote the special matters of that reign, by the kings
own instruction. So that hereby we see no question made of king Henry or his
Counselors touching foreign birth, to let the succession of Lady Margarets
issue: which no doubt would never have been omitted in that learned assembly,
if any law at that time had been esteemed or imagined to bear the same.

And these are six of their principallest reasons to prove, that neither by the
words nor meaning of our common laws, nor yet by custom or practice of our
Realm, an Alien may be debarred from claim of his interest to the Crown,
when it falls to him by righfull descent in blood and succ^ssion. The 7.
reason. The Queen of Scots and her son no Aliens.
But in the particular case of the Queen of Scots and ^erson, they do add
another reason or ^wo: th^reby to prove them in very deed to be no Aliens: Not
only in respect of their often and continual mixture with English blood from
the beginning (and especially of late, the Queens Grandmother and husband being
English, and so her son b^go^ten of an English father) but also for two other
causes and reasons, which seem in truth of very good importance. The first is,
for that Scotland by all Englishmen (howsoever the Scots deny the same) is
taken and holden as subject to England by way of Homage; which many of their
kings at diverse times have acknowledged: and consequently the Queen and her
son being borne in Scotland are not borne out of the allegiance of England, and
so no forrainers. The second cause or reason is, for that the forenamed statute
of forrainers in the 25 year of King Edward the third, is entitled, of those
that are borne beyond the seas. And in the body of the said statute, the doubt
is moved of children borne out of English allegiance beyond the seas: whereby
cannot be understood Scotland, for that it is a piece of the continent land
within the seas. And all our old Records in England, that talk of service to
be done within these two countries, have usually these Latin words,
Infraquatuor m^ria, or in French deins l^zqu^tre mers, that is, within the
four Seas: whereby must needs be understood as well S^otland as England, and
that perhaps for the reason before mentioned, of the subjection of Scotland by
way of Homage to the Crown of England. In respect whereof it may be, that it
was accounted of old but one dominion or allegiance. And consequently, no man
borne therein can be accounted an alie^ to Engla^^. And this shall suffice for
the first point, touching foragine Nativity.

For the second impediment objected, which is the testament of King Henry the
eight, The second impediment against the Q of Scots, and her son, which is K.
Henry the ^. his testament.
authorized by Parliament, whereby they affirm the succession of Scotland to be
excluded: it is not precisely true that they are excluded, but only that they
^re put back behind the succession of the house of Suffolk. For in that
pretended Testament (which after shall be proved to be none indeed) King Henry
so disposes, that after his own children (^f they should chance to dye without
issue) the Crown shall pass to the heirs of Frances and of Elenor, his
neeces by his younger sister Mary Queen of France; and after them (deceasi^g
also without issue) the succession to return to the next heir again. Wh^rby
it is evident, that the succession of Margar^t Queen of Scotland, his eldest
sister, is not excluded; but thrust back only from their due place and order,
to expect the remainder, which may in time be left by the younger. Whereof in
mine opinion, do ensue some considerations against the present pretenders
themselves.

Forain birth no impediment in the judgment of K. Henry the ^.
First, that in King Henry's judgment, the former pretended rule of foraine
birth, was no sufficient impediment against Scotland; for if it had bin, no
doubt but that he would have named the same in his alleged testament, and
thereby have utterly excluded that succession. But there is no such thing in
the testament. Secondly, if they admit this testament, The succession of
Scotland next by the judgment of the competitors.
which alotteth the Crown to Scotland, next after Suffolk; then, seeing that
all the house of Suffolk (by these men's assertions) is excluded by bastardy; it
must needs follow, that Scotland by their own judgment is next, and so this
testament will make against them, ^s indeed it does in all points most
apparently, but only that it prefers the house of Su^^olk, before that of
Scotland. And therefore (I think sir) that you mistake somewhat about their
opinion in alleging this testament. For I suppose, that no man of my Lord of
Huntingtons faction, will allege or urge the testimony of this testament; but
rather some friend of the house of S^ff^lk, in whose favor, I take it, that it
was first of ^ll f^rged.

It may be (qu^th the Gentleman) nor will I stand obstinatly in the contrary;
Gentleman.
for that it is hard sometime to judge of what faction each one is, who
discours^th of these aff^ir^s. But yet I marvel (^f it were as you say) w^y
L^ycesters Father ^f^er K. Edward^ death, made no mention thereof in the favor
of Suffolk, in the other testament which then he proclaimed, as made by K.
Edward deceased, for preferment of Suffolk before his own sisters.

The cause of this is ^vident (quoth the Lawyer) for that it made not
s^ffi^iently for his purpose: Lawyer. The Duke of Northumberland^ drift.
which was to disinherit ^he two d^ughters of King Henry himself, and advance
the house of Suffolk before them both.

A notable change (quo^h the G^ntleman) that a title so much exalted of late by
the Father, Gentleman.
above all order, right, rank and degree; should now be so ^uch debased by the
Son, as thou^h it were not worthy to hold any degree, but rather to be trodden
under-foot for plain bastardy. And you see by th^s, how true it is which I told
you before; The mutable dealing of the house of Dudley.
that the race of Dudlies are most cunning merchants, to make their gain of
all things, men and times. And as we have seen now two test^ments alleged,
the one of the Kings father, and the other of the kings son, and both of them
in prejudice of the testators true successors: so many good subjects beg^n
greatly to fear, that we may chance to see s^ortly a third Test^ment of her
Majesty for the tituling of Huntington, and exurpation of King Henry's blood,
and that before her Majesty can think of sickness^: wherein I beseech the Lord
I be no Prophet. But now, sir, to the foresaid Will and Testament of King
Henry, I have often heard in truth, that the thing was counterfeit, or at the
least not able to be proved: and that it was discovered, rejected, and defaced
in Queen Mary's time: but I would gladly understand what you Lawyers esteem or
judge thereof.

Lawyer.
Touching this matter (quoth the Lawyer) it cannot be denied, but that in the
28. and 36 years of King Henry's reign, The authority and occasion of King
Henry's testament.
upon consideration of some doubt and ir^esolution, which the King himself had
showed, to have about the order of succ^ssion in his own children, as also for
taking away all occasions of controversies in those of the next blood; the
whole Parliament gave authority unto the said King, to debate and determine
those matters himself, together with his learned council, who best knew the
laws of the Realm, and titles that any man might h^ve thereby: and that
whatsoever succ^ssion his Majesty should declare as most right and lawful
under his letters patents sealed, or by his last Will and T^st^ment rightfully
made and signed with his own hand: that the some should be received for good
and lawful. Upon pretense whereof, soon after King Henry's death, there was
showed a Will with the kings stamp at the same, and the names of diverse
witnesses, wherein (as has been said) the succession of the Crown, after the
king^ own children, is assigned to the heirs of Frances and Elenore, Neeces
to the king, by his younger Sister. Which assignation of the Crown, being as it
were a mere gift in prejudice of the elder sisters right (as also of the right
of Frances and Elenor themselves who were omitted in the same assignation, and
their heirs entitled only) was este^med to be against all reason, law, and
nature, The King^ Testament forged.
and consequently not thought to proceed from so wise and sage a Prince as K.
Henry was known to be: but rather, either the whole forged, or at least wise
that clause inserted by other, and the Kings stamp set unto it, after his
death, or when his Majesty lay now past understanding. And hereof there wants
not diverse most evident reasons and proofs.

For first, it is not prob^ble nor credible, that King Henry would ever go
about, The first reason.
against law and reason, to disinherit the line of his eldest sister, without
any profit or interest to himself: and thereby, give most evident occasion of
Civil war and discord within the Realm, seeing, Injustice and improprobabilit^
that in such a case of manifest and apparent wrong, in so great a m^tter, the
authority of Pa^lament, takes little effect, against the true and lawful
inherit^r: as well appeared in the former times and contentions of Henry the
sixth, Edward the fourth, and Richard the third: in whose reigns, the diverse
and contrary Parliaments made and holden, against the ne^t inheritor, held no
longer with any man, then until the other was able to make his own party
good.

So likewise, The example of France.
in the case of King Edward the third his succession to F^ance, in the right of
his mother, though he were exclud^d by the general assembly and consent of
their Parliaments; yet he esteemed not his right extinguished thereby: as
neither did other Kings of our Country that ensued after him. And for our
present case, if nothing else should have restrained King Henry, from such
open injustice toward his eldest sister: yet this cogitation, at least, would
have stayed him: that by giving example of supplanting his elder sisters Line,
by virtue of a testament or pretense of Parliament; some other might take
occasion to displace his children by like pretense: as we see that Duke Dudley
did soon after by a forged testament of King Edward the sixth. So ready
Scholars there are to be found, which easily will learn such lessons of
iniquity.

Secondly, there be too many incongruities and indignities in the said
pretended Will to proceed from such a Prince and learned council as King
Henry's was. The second reason. Incongruities and indignities.
For first, what can be more ridiculous, than to give the Crown to the heirs
of Francis and Elenor, and not to any of themselves? or what had they offended
that their heirs should enjoy the Crown in their right, and not they
themselves? What if King Henry's Children should have dyed, whiles Lady Francis
had been yet alive? who should have possessed the Kingdom before her, seeing
her Line was next? and yet by this testament she could not pretend her self
to obtain it. But rather having married Adrian Stokes her horse-keeper, Adrian
Stokes.
she must have suffered her son by him (if she had any) to enjoy the Crown:
and so Ad^ian of a Serving man and Master of Horses, should have become the
great Master and Protector of England. Of like absurdity is that other clause
also, wherein the King binds his own daughters to marry by consent and
direction of his counsel, or otherwise to leese the benefit of their
succession: yet binds not hi^ Neices daughters, to wit, the daughters of
Francis and Elenor (if they had any) to any such condition.

Thirdly, there may be diverse causes and arguments alleged in law, why this
pretended will is not authentical: if otherwise, The third reason.

The presupposed Will is not authentical.


it were certain that King Henry had meant it: first, for that it is not
agreeable to the mind and meaning of the Parliament, which intended only to
give authority for declaration and explication of the true title: and not for
donation, or intricating of the same, to the ruin of the Re^lme. Secondly, for
that there is no lawful and authentical Copy extant thereof, but only a
bare inrolement in the Chancerie, which is not sufficient in so weighty an
affair: no witness of the privy Council or of Nobilit^e to the same: which
had been convenient in so great a case (for the best of the witnesses therein
named, is Sir John Gates, whose miserable death is well known:) no public
Notary, no probation of the will before any Bishop, or any lawful Court for
that pu^pose: no examination of the witness^s; or other thing orderly done, for
lawful authorizing of the matter.

But of all other things this is most of importance: that the King never set
his own hand to the foresaid Will, The disproving of the Will by witnesses. The
Lo^d Paget.
but his stamp was put thereunto by others, either after his death, or when he
was past remembrance: as the late Lord Paget in the beginning of Queen Mary's
days, being of the Privy Council, first of all other discovered the same of
his own accord, and upon mere motion of conscience, confessing before the
whole Council, and afterward also before the whole Parliament, how that
himself was privy thereunto, and partly also culpable, (being drawn thereunto,
by the instigation and forcible authority of others:) but yet afterward upon
other more godly motions detested the device: and so of his own free will,
very honorably went and offered the discovery thereof to the Council. Sir
Edw. Montague
As also did Sir E^ward Montague, Lord chief Justice that had been p^ivy and
present at the said doings, and one William Clarke, William Cla^ke.
that was the man who put the stamp unto the paper, and is ascribed among the
other preten^ed witnesses, confessed the whole premises to be true, and
purchased his pardon for his offense therein. Whereupon Queen Marie and her
Council, caused presently the said Inrolement, lying in the Chancerie to be
cancelled, defaced and ^bolished.

And sithence that time in her Majesty's days that now lives, about the 11.
or 12. year of her reign, (if I count not amiste) by occasion of a c^rtaine
little book spread abroad at that time v^ry s^cretly, for advancing of the
house of Suffolk, by pretense of this Testament: A meeting together about this
matter of the Nobility.
I remember well the place where the late Duke of Norfolk, the Marqu^sse of
Winchester (which then was Treasu^er) the old Ea^les of Arundell and Penbroo^e
that now are dead, with my Lord of Penbrook that yet lives, (as also my Lord
of Leycester himself, if I be not deceived) with divert others, met together
upon this matter: and after long conference about the foresaid pretensed will,
and many proofs and reasons laid down, why it could not be true or
authentical: the old Earl of Penbrook protesting that he was with the King in
his chamber from the first day of his sickness unto his last hour, and
thereby could well assure the falsification thereof: at length it was moved,
that from that place they should go, with the rest of the Nobility, and
procl^ime the Queen of Scotland he^re apparent in Cheap Side. M^ Lord of
L^^^est. again pl^y^^ double.
Wherein my Lord of Leycester (a^ I take it was then as forward as any man
else: how be it, now for his profit, he be turned aside, and would turn back
again to morrow next for a greater commodity.

And albeit, for some causes to themselves best known, they proceeded not in
the open publishing of their determination at that time: yet my Lord of
Penbrook now living can bear witness that thus much is true: and that his
father, the old Earl, The old Earl of Penbrooks admonition to the Earl his
son, yet living.
at that time told him openly before the other Noblemen, that he had brought
him to that assembly and place to instruct him in that truth, and to charge him
to witness the same, and to defend it also with his sword (if need required)
after his death. And I know that his Lordship is of that honor and Nobility,
as he cannot leave off easily the remembrance or due regard of so worthy an
admonition. And this shall suffice for the second ^mp^diment, imagin^d to
proceed of this supposed Testament of King Henry the eighth.

As for the third impediment, of religion, The thi^d impediment of religion.
it is not general to all: for that only one person (if I be not deceived) of
all the Competitors in K. Henry's Line can be touched ^ith suspicion of
different Religion, from the present state of England. Which person
notwithstanding (as is well known) while she was in government in her own
Realm of Scotland, permitted all l^berty of Conscience, and free exercise of
Religion to those of the contrary prof^ssion and opinion, without restraint.
And if she had not, yet do I not see, either by prescript of law, or practice
of these our times, that diversity of Religion may stay just Inheritors from
enjoying their due possessions, in any state or degree of private men: and much
less in the claim of a Kingdom: which always in this behalf as has been
said before) is preferred in privilege.

This we see by experience, in diverse Countries and parts of the world at this
day: Princes of Germany.
as in Germany, where among so many Princes, and so divided in religion as they
be: yet every one succeeds to the state whereto he has right, without
resistance for his religion. The ex^mples also of her Majesty that now is, and
of her sister before, is evident, who being known to be of two different
inclinations in religion, Qu. Mary Queen Elizabeth.
and the whole Realm divided in opinion for the same cause: yet both of them
at their several times with general consent of all, were admitted to their
lawful inheritance: excepting only a fe^ The Dudleis Monsieur.
tr^i^ors against the f^rmer, who withstood her right, as also in her the right
of her Majesty that is present, and that not for Religion, (as appe^red by
their own confession after) but for ^mbition and desire of reign, Monsieur,
the Kings brother and heir of France, as all the world knows, is well
accept^d, favored, and admitted for successor of that Crown, by all the
P^otestants at this d^y of that Coun^ry, notwithstanding his opinion in
religion known to be different. And I doubt not, but the King of Navarre or
Prince of Condy, King of Navarre Prince of Condy.
in the contrary part would think themselves gre^tly injured by the st^te of
^rance, which is d^fferent from them in religion at this d^y, if after the
death of the King that now is, and his brother without issue, (if God so
dispose) they should be barred from inheriting the Crown, under pretense only
of their Religion. My Lord of Huntington himself also, is he not known to b^e
of a different religion from the present state of Engl^nd? My Lord of
Huntingtons re^igion.
and rh^t, if he we^e King to morrow n^xt, he would alter the who^e government,
order, condi^ion, and state of religion, now used and established within the
Realm?

But as I said in the beginning, if one of a whole family, or of diverse
families be culpable, The title of those that ensue the Queen of Scots.
or to be touched herein; what have the rest offended thereby? will you exclude
all, for the mislike of one? And to descend in order; if the first in K.
Henry's line, after her Majesty may be touched in this point, yet why should
the rest be damnified thereby? The K of Scotland her son, that next ensues (to
speak in equity) why should he be shut out for his religion? And are not all
the other in like manner Protestants, whose descent i^ consequent by nature,
order, and degree.

For the young K. of Scotland (quoth I) the truth is, that always for mine own
part, Scholar. The young King of Scotland
I have had great hope and expectation of him, not only for the conceit which
commonly men have of such Orient youths, borne to kingdoms; but especially for
that I understood from time to time, that his education was in all learning,
princely exercises, and instruction of true religion, under rare and virtuous
men for that purpose. Whereby I conceived hope, that he might not only become
in time an honorable and profitable neighbor unto us, for assurance of the
Gospel in these parts of the world; but also (if God should deprive us of her
Majesty without issue)* might be a mean by his succession to unite in Concord
and Government the two Realms together, which heretofore has been sought by
the price of mary a thousand men's blood, and not obtained.

Marry yet now of late (I know not by what means) there (...) ^egun in men's
hearts a certain mislike or grudge against him, for that it is given out every
where that he is inclined to be a Papist, and an enemy to her Majesty's
proceedings, which argues him verily of singular ingratitude if it be true,
considering the great helps and p^otection which he has received from her
Highness ever since he was borne.

Gentl.
And are you so simple (quoth the Gentleman) as to believe every report that
you hear of this matter? know you not, that it is expedient for my Lord of
Leycester and his faction, that this youth, above all other, be held in
perpetual disgrace with her Majesty, and with this Realm? You know, that
Richard of Gloucester h^d never been able to have usurped as he did, The device
to set out her Majesty with the young King of Scotland.
if he had not first persuaded K. Edward the fourth, to hate his own brother
the Duke of Clarence, which Duke stood in the w^y between Richard and the
thing, which he most of all things coveted: that is, the possibility to the
Crown, and so in this case is there the like device to be observed.

For truly, for the young King of Scotlands religion, it is evident to as many
as have reason, that it can be no other of it self but inclined to the best;
both in respect of his education, instruction, and conversation wi^h those of
true religion: as also by his former actions, Edicts, Government, and private
behavior he has declared. Marry these men whose profit is nothing less,
than tha^ he or any other of that race should do well: do not cease daily by
all secret ways, drifts, and molestations possible, to drive him either to
mislike of our religion, or else to incur the suspicion thereof, with such of
our Realm, as otherwise would be his best friends: or if not this, yet for
very need and fear of his own life, to make recourse to such other Princes
abroad, as may most offend or misl^ke this st^te.

And for this cause, they suborne certain busy fellows of their own crew
and faction, pertaining to the ministry of Scotland, The intolerable
pr^ceedings of c^rt^i^ ^inist^rs in S^otl^nd against t^eir ^i^g ^ subornation
of his enemies in Engla^^.
(but unworthy of so worthy a calling) to use such insolency toward their
King and Prince, as is not only undecent, but intolerable. For he may do
nothing, but they will examine and discuss the same in Pulpit. If he go but
on hunting, when it pleases them to call him to their preaching: if he make
but a dinner or supper, when, or where, or with whom they like not: if he
receive but a couple of horses, or other present from his fri^nds or kinsemen
beyond the seas: if he salute or use courteously any man, or messenger which
comes from them (as you know Princes of their nob^lity and courtesy are
accust^med, though they come from their enemies, as very often has been
seen, and highly commended in her Majesty of England:) If h^e deal
famil^a^ly with any Ambass^dor which likes not them: or finally, if he do
say or signify any one thing whatsoever that pleases not their humor, they
will presently as seditious Tribunes of the people, exclaim in public; and
stepping to the Pulpit where the Word of the Lord only ought to be preached,
will excite the Communalty to discontentation, inveying against their
Sovereign with such bitterness of speech, unreverend terms, and insolent
controlements, as is not to be spoken: Now imagine what her Majesty and her
grave council would do in England, if such proceedings should be used by the
Clergy against them.

No doubt (quoth I) but that such unquiet spirits should be punished in our
Realm. Scholar.
And so I s^^d of late to their most reverend and* Sir Patri^k Ad^m on
Archbish. of St. Andrews.
worthy Prelate and Primate the Archbishop of St. Andrews, with whom it was my
luck to come acquainted in London, whither he was come by his Kings appointment
(as he said) to treat certain affairs with our Q. and Council. And talking
with him of this disorder of his ministry, he confessed the same with much
grief of mind, and told me, that ^e had preached thereof before the K.
himself, detesting and accusing diverse heads thereof, for which cause he was
become very odious to them and other of their faction, both in Scotland and
England. But he said, that as he had given the reasons of his doings unto our
Qu. so means he shortly to do the same unto Monsieur Beza, and to the whole
Church of Geneva, by sending thither the Articles of his and their do^ngs,
prote^^ing unto me that the proceedings and attempts of those factious and
corrupt men was most scandalous, seditious and perilous both to the K. person,
and to the realm; being sufficien^ indeed, to alienate wholly the young Prince
from all affection to our religion, when he shall see the chief Professors
thereof to behave themselves so undutifully toward him.

Gentl. Treasons plotted against the King of Scots.
That is the thing which these men, his competitors, most desire ( quoth the
Gentleman) hoping thereby to procure him most evil will and danger, both at
home and from England. For which cause also, they have practiced so many plots
and treacheries with his own subjects against him; hoping by that means to
bring the one in distrust and hatred of the other, and consequently the K. in
danger of destruction by his own. And in this machination, they have behaved
themselves so dexterously, so covertly used the manage and contriving hereof,
and so cunningly conveyed the execution of many things: as i^ might, indeed,
seem apparent to the young K. that the whole plot of treasons against his
Realm, and Person, does come from England, thereby to drive him into jealousy
of our state, and our state of him: and all this for their own profit.

Neither is this any new device of my Lord of Leicest to draw men for his own
gain into danger and hatred with the state, under other pretenses. For I could
tell you diverse stories and stratagems of his cunning in this kind, and the one
far different from the other in device: but yet all to one end. I have a
friend yet living, that was toward the old Earl of Arundel in good credit,
and by that means had occasion to deal with the late Duke of Norfolk in his
chiefest affairs before his troubles. This man is wont to report strange
things from the Dukes own mouth, of my L. of Leicesters most treacherous
dealing toward him, for gaining of his blood, as after appeared, Leycesters
cunning device for overthrowing the D. of Norf.
albeit the Duke when he rep^rted the same, mistrusted not so much my Lords
malice therein. But the sum of all, is this in effect: that Leicester having a
secret desire to pull down the said Duke, to the end that he might have no man
above himself, to hinde^ him in that which he most desires; by a thousand
cunning devices drew in the Duke to the cogitation of that marriage with the
Queen of Scotland, which afterward was the cause or occasion of his ruin. And
he behaved himself so dexterously in this drift, by setting on the Duke ^n
the one side, and also by intrapping him on the other: The impudency of Judas.
as Judas himself never played his part more cunningly when he supped with his
Master, and set himself so near, as he dipped his spoon in the same dish, and
durst before others, ask who should betray him? meaning that night to do it
himself, as he showed soon after supper, when he came as a Captain with a
band of Conspir^tors, and with a courteous kiss^ delivered his person into the
hands of them, whom he well knew to thirst after his blood.

The very like did the Earl of Leycester with the Duke of No^fo^k for the a^t
of treason, though in the parties b^tr^yed there were great difference of
innocence. N^mely, at one time, when her Majesty was at Basing in Hampshire,
and the Duke attended there to have audience, with great indiff^^ency in
himself to follow, or leave off his suit for marriage: (for that now he began
to suspect, her Majesty liked not greatly thereof:) my Lord of Leycester came
to him and counseled him in any case to persevere, and not to relent, The
speeches of Leycester ^o the Duke of Norf.
assuring him with many oaths and pro^est^tions, that her Majesty must and
should be brought to allow thereof, whether she would or no, and that him^^l^e
would se^le that purpose with his blood N^i^her was unto be suffered that her
Majesty should have her will herein; with many other like speeches to this
purpose: which the Duke repea^ed again then presently to my said friend: with
often laying his hand upon his bosom and saying; I have here which ^ss^reth me
sufficiently of the fidelity of my Lord of Leycester; Leycest. cousen^ge of the
Queen.
meaning not only the foresaid speeches, bu^ also diverse lette^s which he had
written to the Duke of that effect, as likewise he had done to some other
person of more importance in the Realm; which matter coming afterward to
(...), he cousened most notably her Majesty, by showing her a reformed copy of
the said Letter, for the Letter it self.

But now how well he perform^d his promise, in deali^g with her Majesty for the
Duke or against the Duke in this matter, her Highness can best tell, and the
event it self showed. For the Duke being admitted soon after to her Majesty's
speech at another place, and receiving a far other answer than he had in hop^
conceived upon Leycesters promises, retired himself to London, The Duke of
Norf. flying into Norfolk
where the same night following he received Letters both from Leycester, and
Sir Nicholas Thregmorton, upon Leycesters instigation (for they were at that
time both friends and of a f^ction) that he should presently fly into Norfolk,
^s he did, which was the last and final complement of all L^ycest. former
devices, whereby to pl^nge his friend over the ears in su^pi^ion and disgrace,
in such sort as he should never be able to d^^w himself out of the ditch
again, as indeed he was not, but dyed in the same.

And herein you see also the same subtle and Machivilian slight, which I
mentioned before, Machivilian slights
of driving men to attempt somewhat, whereby they may incur danger, or
remain in perpetual suspicion or disgrace. And this practice h^ has long
used, and does daily, against such as he has will to destroy. As for example,
what say you to the device he had of late, to entrap his well deserving friend,
Sir Christopher Hatton, Leycesters devices for the overthrow of Sir Christopher
Hatton.
in the matter of Hall his Priest, whom he would have had Sir Christopher to
send away and hide, being touched and detected in the case of Ardent, thereby
to have drawn in Sir Christopher himself, as Sir Charles Candish can well
declare, if it please him, being accessory to this plot, for the overthrow of
Sir Christopher: To which intent, and most devilish drift, pertained (I doubt
not) if the matter were duly examined, the late interception of letters in
Paris from one Aldred of Lions, then in Rome, to Henr. Vmpton, servant to Sir
Christopher, in which letters, Sir Christopher is reported to be of such credit
and special favor in Rome, as if he were the greatest Papist in England.

What means also these pernicious late dealings against the Earl of
Shrewsburie, Leycesters devices against the Earl of Shrewsbury.
a man of the most ancient and worthiest Nobility of our Realm? what mean the
practices with his nearest both in bed and blood against him? what mean those
most false and slanderous rumors cast abroad of late of his disloyal
demeanours toward her Majesty and his country, with the great prisoner
committed to his charge? is all this to any other end, but only to drive him
to some impatience, and thereby to commit or say something which may open the
gate unto his ruin? Diverse other things could I recite of his behavior
toward other noble men of the Realm, who live abroad in their countries much
injured and malecontented by his insolency: Leyceste^s cont^mpt of the ancient
Nobility of England.
albeit in respect of his present power they dare not complain. And surely, it
is strange to see how little account he makes of all the ancient nobility of
our Realm: how he contemns, derideth and debaseth them; which is the fashion
of all such as mean to usu^p, to the end they may have none who shall not
acknowledge their first beginning and advancement from themselves.

Not only usurpers ( quoth the Lawyer) but all others who rise and mount aloft
from base lynage, Lawyer.
be ordinarily most contemptuous, contumultuous, and insolent against others of
more antiquity And this was evident in this man's father, who being a Buck of
the first head ( as you know) was intolerable in contempt of others: New men
most contemptuous.
as appears by those whom he trod down of the Nobility in his time: as
also by his ordinary jests against the Duke of Somerset and others. But among
other times, sitting one day at his own table (as a Counselor told me that
was present) he took occasion to talk of the Earl of Arundel, D. Dudlies jest
at the Earl of Arundell.
whom he had then not only removed from the Counsel, but also put into the
Tower of London, being (as is well known) the first and chiefest Earl of the
Realm. And for that the said Earl showed himself somewhat sad and afflicted
with his present state (as I marvel not, seeing himself in prison, and within
the compass of so fierce a Bears paws) it pleased this goodly Duke to vaunt
upon this Earls misery, at his own Table (as I have said) and asked the noble
men and gentlemen there present, what Crest or Cognizance my L. of Arundel did
give? and when every one answered, that he gave the white horse: I thought so
(quoth the Duke) and not without great cause; for as the white Paulfrey when he
stands in the stable, and is well provendred, is proud and fierce, and ready
to leap on every other horses back, still neying, and prauncing, and troubling
all that stand about him: but when he is once out of his hot stable, and
deprived a little of his case and fat feeding, every boy may ride and master
him at his pleasure: so is it (quoth he) with my Lord of Arundell. Whereat many
marvelled that were present, to hear so insolent speech pass from a man of
judgment, against a Peer of the Realm cast into calamity.

But you would more have marvelled (quoth the Gentleman) if you had seen that
which I did afterward, Gentl.
which was the most base and abject behavior of the same Duke to the same
Earl of Arundel at Cambridge, and upon the way toward London: The often abject
beha^iour of Duke Dudley in adverse fortunes.
when this Earl was sent to apprehend and bring him up, as prisoner. If I
should tell you how he fell down on his knees, how he wept, how he besought the
said Earl to be a good Lord unto him, whom a little before he had so much
contemned and reproached, you would have said that himself might as well be
compared to this his white Paulfrey, as the other: Albeit in this I will excuse
neither of them both, neither almost any of these great men who are so proud
and insolent in their prosperous fortune, as they are easily led to contemn
any man, albeit themselves be most contemptible of all others, whenever
their fortune begins to change: and so will my L. of Leicester be, also no
doubt at that day, though now in his wealth he triumph over all, and cares not
whom, Scholar.
or how many he offend and injure.

Sir, therein I believe you quoth I) for we have had sufficient trial already
of my Lords fortitude in adversity. Leycesters base behavior in adversity.
His base and abject behavior in his last disgrace about his marriage, well
declared what he would do in a matter of more importance His fawning and
flattering of them, whom he hated most: his servile speeches, his feigned and
dissembled tears, are all very well known: Leyc^ste^s deceiving of Sir
Chr^stopher Hatton.
Then Sir Christopher Hatton must needs be enforced to receive at his hands the
h^nourable and great office of Chamberlainship of Chester, for that he would by
any means re^gne the same unto him, whether he would or no: and made him
provide (not without his charge) to receive the same, though his Lordship never
meant it, as after well appeared. For that the present pange being past, it
liked my Lord to fulfill the Italian Proverb, of such as in dangers make vows
to Saints: Scampato il pericolo* gabbato il santo, the danger escaped, the
Saint is deceived.

Then, and in that necessity, no men of the Realm were so much honored
commended, and served by him as the noble Chamberlain deceased, and the good
Lord Treasurer yet living: A pretty shift of my Lord of Leycester.
to whom, at a certain time, he wrote a letter in all fraud and base
dissimulation, and caused the same to be delivered with great cunning in the
sight of her Majesty; and yet so, as to show a purpose that it should not be
seen. to the end, her Highness might rather take occasion to call for the same
and read it, as she did. For Mistress Francis H^ward (to whom the stratagem was
committed) playing her part dexterously, offered to deliver the same to the
Lord Treasurer, near the do^re of the withdrawing Chamber, he then coming
from her Majesty: And to draw the eye and attention of her Highness the more
unto i^, she let fall the paper, before it touched the treasurers hand, and by
that occasion brought her Majesty to call for the same: Which after she had
read and considered the style, together with the metal and constitution of him
that wrote it, and to whom it was lent, Her Majesty's speech of Leycest^r to
the T^e^su^e^.
her Highness could not but break forth in laughter, with detestation of such
absurd and abject dissimulation: say^ng unto my Lord Treasurer there present:
my Lord believe him not. for if he had you in like case, he would play the
Bear with you, though at this present he fawn upon you never so fast.

But now Sir, I pray you go forward in your speech of Scotland, for there I
remember you left off, when by occasion we fell into these digressions.

Gentl.
Well then (quoth the Gentleman) to retur^e again to Scotland (as you move)
from whence we have digressed: most certain and evident it is to all the
world, that all the broils, troubles, and dangers procured to the Prince in
that country, as also the vexations of them, who any way are thought to favor
that title in our own Realm, The danger of her Majesty by oppression of the
favorers of the Scottish title.
do proceed from the drift and complot of these conspirators. Which besides
the great dangers mention^d before, both domestical and foreign, temporal,
and of religion, must needs infer great jeopardy also to her Majesty's person
and present reign, that now governs, through the hope and heat of the
aspir^rs ambition, inflamed and increased so much the more by the nearenesse of
their desired prey.

For as soldiers entered into the hope of a rich and well furnished City, are
more fierce and furious, when they have gotten and beaten down the Bullwa^ks
round about: A Similie true.
and as the greedy Burgl^rer that has pierced and broken down man wa^ls to
come to a treasure, is less patient of stay, stop, and delay, when he comes
in sight of that which he desires, or perceives only some partition of wane
skot or the like betwixt his fingers, and the cofers or money bags: so the^e
men when they shall see the succession of Scotland extinguished, together with
all friends and favour^rs thereof, (which now are to her Majesty as Bullwarks
and walls, and great obstacles to the aspirors) and when they shall see only
her Mai^sties life and person, to stand betwixt them and their fiery desires
(for they make little account of all other Competitors by King H^nries line:)
no doubt but it will be to them a great prick and spur to dispatch Her
Majesty also: the nature of both Earls being well considered, Earl of
Leycester.
whereof the one killed his own wife, (as has been showed before) only upon a
little vain hope of marriage with a Queen, and the other being so far
blinded and borne away with the same furious fume, Earl of Huntington.
and most impotent itching humor of ambition, as his own mother, when she was
alive, seemed greatly to fear his fingers, if once the matter should come so
near, as her life had only stood in his way. For which cause, the good old
Countess was wont to pray God (as I have heard diverse say) that she might dye
before her Majesty (which happily was granted unto her) to the en^ that by
standing in her sons way (who she saw to her grief, furiously bent to wear a
Crown: The old Countess of Huntingtons speech of her son.
) there might not some dangerous extremi^y grow to her by that nearenesse: And
if his own mother feared this mischance, wh^t may her Majesty doubt at his,
and his companions han^s, when she only shall be the obstacle of all their
unbridled and impatient de^res?

Clear it is (quoth the Lawyer) that the nearenesse of aspirors to the ^^owne,
Lawyer.

Nea^enesse in competitors does incite them to adventure.

Henr. Bullingb^ook after King H. the 4


endangereth greatly the present possessors, as you have well proved by reason,
and I could show by diverse examples, if it were need. For when Henry
Bullingbrooke, Duke of Lancaster, saw not only Richard the second to be
without issue, but also Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, that should have
succeeded in the Crown, to be slain in Ireland: though before (as is thought)
he meant not to usurp, yet seeing the possibility and near cut that he had,
was invited therewith to lay hands of his Sovereigns blond and dignity as he
did. Richard Duke of Gloucester after King Richard the third.
The like is thought of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, that he never meant the
murder of his nephews, until he saw their father dead, and themselves in his
own hands; his brother also Duke of Clarence dispatched, and his only son
and heir ^arle of Warwick within his own power.

Wherefore seeing that it has not pleased Almighty God, for causes to himself
best known, to leave unto this noble Realm, any issue by her most excellent
Majesty, it has been a point of great wisdom in mine opinion, The great
wi^edome of her Majesty in conserving the next heirs of Scotland.
and of great safety to her Highness person, state, and dignity, to preserve
hitherto the line of the next Inheritors by the house of Scotland, (I mean
both the mother and the son) whose deaths has been so diligently sought by
the other Competitors and had been long ere this achieved, if her Majesty's
own wisdom, and royal clemency (as is thought) had not placed special eye
upon the conservation thereof, from time to time. Which Princely providence, so
long as it shall endure, must needs be a great safety and fortres^ to her
Majesty, not only against the claims, aides, or annoyance of foreign
Princes, wh^ will not be so forward to advance strange titles while so manifest
heirs remain at home, nor ye^ so willing (in respect of policy) to ^elpe tha^
line to possession of the whole Island: but also against practices of
domestical aspirers (as yo^ have showed) in whose affairs no doubt but these
two branches of Sc^tland are great b^ocks, as also special bulwarks to her
Majesty's life and person: seeing (as you say) these copartners make so little
account of the other of that line, who should ensue by order of succession.

Marry yet of the two, The K. of Scotlands d^struction of more importance to
the conspirators, then his mothers
I think the youth of Scotland be of much more importance for their purpose,
to be made away, both for that he may have issue, and is like in time to be
of more ability, for defense of his own inheritance: as also for that he being
once dispatched, his mother should soon ensue by one slight or other, which
they would devise unwitting to her Majesty: albeit, I must needs confess that
her Highness has used most singular prudence for prevention thereof, in
placing her restraint with so noble, strong, The Earl of Salisbury dis^rac^d
by the competitors.
and worthy a Peer of our Realm, as the Earl of Shrewsburie is, whose
fidelity and constancy being nothing pliable to the others faction, gives them
little contentation. And for that cause the world sees how many sundry and
diverse devices they have used, and do use daily to slander and disgrace him,
and thereby to pull from him his charge committed

To this the Gentleman answered nothing at all, Gentl.
but stood st^ll musing with himself, as though he had conceived some deep
matter in his head ^ and after a little pause he began to say as follows

I cannot truly but much marvel, The vigilant eye that her Majesty's (...)
h^d to the ^olat^rall li^e.
when I do compare some things of this time and government, with the doings of
form^r Princes, Progenitors to her Majesty. Namely of Henry the 7. and Henry
the 8. who had so vigilant an eye to the laterall line of King Edward the 4. by
his brother of Clarence, as they thought it necessary, not only to prevent all
evident dangers that might ensue that way, but even the possibilities of all
peril: as may well appear by the execution of Ed. Earl of Warwick before named
Son and heir to the said Duke of Clarence, and of Ma^ga^et his sister
Countess of Salisbury, with the Lord Henry Montague her son, by whose
Dau^hter the Earl of Huntington now claims. Persons executed of the h^use of
Cla^e^ce
All which were executed for avoiding of inconveniences, and that at such
times, when no imminent danger could be much doubted by that Line, especially
by the latter. And yet now when one of the same house and Line, of more ability
and ambition, than ever any of his Ancestors were, makes open title and claim
to the Crown, with plots, packs, and preparations to most manifest usurpation,
against all order, all law, and all rightful succession: and against a special
statute provided in that behalf: yet is he permitted, bo^ne out, favored, and
friended therein: and no man so hardy, as in defe^c^ ^f her Majesty and the
Realm to contr^^le hi^ for the same.

It may be that her Majesty is brought into the same o^inion of my Lord of
Huntingtons fidelity, The example of Julius Caesa^s destruction.
as Julius Caesar was of Marcus Brutus, his dearest obliged friend: of whose
ambitious practices, and aspiring, when Caesar was advertised by his careful
friends; he an^wered, that he well knew Brutus to be ambitious, but I am sure
(quoth he that my Brutu^ will never attempt any thing for the Empire while
Caesar lives: and after my death let him shift for the same among others, a^
he can. But what ensued? Surely I am loath to tell the event for ominations
sake, but yet all the world knows that ere many months passed, this most
noble and ^lement Emperor was pitifully murdered ^y the same Brutus and his
partners in the public Senate, when least of all he expected such treason. So
dangerous a thing it is to be secure in a matter of so great sequel, or to
trust them with a man's life, who may pretend preferment or interest by his
death.

Wherefore, would God her Majesty in this case might be induced to have such
due care and regard of her own estate and royal person, as the weighty moment
of the matter requires: which contains the bliss and calamity of so noble
and worthy a kingdom as this.

I know right well, Too much confidence very perilous in a Prince.
that most excellent natures are always furthest off from diffidence in such
people as proves love, and are most bounden by duty: and so it is evident in
her Majesty. But yet surely, this confidence so commendable in other men, is
scarce allowable oftentimes in the person of a Prince: for that it goes
accompanied with so great peril. as is inevitable to him that will not suspect
principally when dangers are foretold or presaged, (as commonly by Gods
appointment they are, f^r the special hand he holds over Princes affairs)
or when there is probable conjecture, or just surmise of the same.

We know that the forenamed Emperor Caesar, had not only the warning given him
of the inclination and intent of Brutus to usurpation, but even the very day
when he was going toward the place of his appointed destiny, there was given
up into his hands a detection of the whole treason, with request to read the
same presently, The example of Alexander the great, bow he was foretold his
danger.
which he upon confidence omitted to do. We read also of Alexander the great,
how he was not only forbidden by a learned man to enter into Babylon (whither
he was then going) for that there was treason meant against him in the place,
but also that he was foretold of Antipaters mischievous meaning against him ^n
particular. Bu^ the young Prince h^ving so well deserved of Antipat^r, could not
b^ brought to mist^ust the man that was so dea^e unto him: and by that means
was poisoned in a banqu^t by three sons of Antipater, which were of most credit
and confidence in the Kings Chamber.

Here, truly, my heart did somewhat tremble with fear, Scholar.
horror, and det^station of such events. And I said unto the Gentlem^n: I
beseech you Sir, to talk no more of these matters; for I cannot well abide to
hear them named: hoping in the Lord that there is no c^use, nor ever shall be,
to doubt the like in England: especially from th^se m^n, who are so much bound
to her Majesty, L^te executions.
and so forward in seeking out, and pursuing all such a^ may be t^ought to be
d^ngerous to her Majesty's person, as by the ^und^y late executions we have
have se^n, and by the punishments every way of Papists we may perceive.

Truth it is (quoth the Gentlem^n) that justice has bin done upon diverse of
late, Gentl.
which contenteth me g^eatly, for the terrou^ and r^straint of others, of what
sect or religion so^ver they be: And it is most nec^ssary (doubtless) for the
compressing of pa^ti^s, that great vigilance be used in tha^ behalf. But when
I consider, that only one kind of men are touched he^ein: and that all spee^h,
regard, doubt, distrust, and watch is of them alone; without reflection of eye
upon other men's doings or d^signements: when I see the double diligence and
vehemence of c^rtaine instruments, which I like not, bent wholly to raise
wonder and admiration of the people fear, terror, and attention to the
d^in^s, sayings, and meanings of one part or ^action alone, and of that namely
and only which these conspirators esteem for most dangerous and opposite to
themselves: Fraud to be feared in pursuing one part or faction only.

The comparison of Wolves and Rebels.


I am (believe me) often tempted to suspect fraud and false measure: and that
these men deal, as wolves by nature in other Countries are wont to do: Which
going together in great numbers to assail a flock of sheep by night, do set
some one or two of their company upon the wind side of the fold a far off, who
parley by their sent and other bruteling, which of purpose they make, may draw
the dogs and shepherds to pursue them alone, whiles the other do enter and
slay the whole flock. Or as rebels that meaning to surprise a Town, to turn
away the Inhabitants from considering of the danger, and from defense of that
place, where they intend to enter, do set on fire some other parts of the
Town further off, and do sound a false alarm at some gate, where is meant
least danger.

Which art was used cunningly by Richard D. of York in the time of King Henry
the sixth, Richard Duke of York.
when he to cover his own int^nt, brought all the Realm in doubt of the
doings of Edmond Duke of Somerset, his enemy. D. Dudly.
But John of Northamberland, father to my Lord of Leycester, used the same art
much more skilfully, when he put all England in a maze and musing of the
Protector, and of his friends: as though nothing could be safe about the young
King, until they were suppress^d: and consequently, all brought into his own
authority, without obstacle. A good rule of policy.
I speak not this to excuse Papists, or to wish them any way spared wherein
they offend: but only to signify that in a Country, where so potent factions
be, it is not safe, to suffer the one to make it self so puissant by pursuit
of the other: as afterward the Prince must remain at the devotion of the
stronger: but rather as in a body molested and troubled with contrary humors,
if all cannot be purged, the best Physic is without all doubt to reduce and
hold them at such an equality, as destruction may not be feared of the
predominant.

To this said the Lawyer laughing, yea marry Sir, I would to God your opinion
might prevail in this matter; for then should we be in other terms then
now we are. I was, not long since, in company of a cetaine honorable Lady of
the Court, who, after some speech passed by Gentlemen that were present, of
some apprehended, and some executed, and such like aff^ires, brake into a great
complaint of the present time, and therewith (I assure you) moved all the
hearers to grief (as women you know are potent in stirring of affections) and
caused them all to wish that her Majesty had been nigh to have heard her words.

The speech of a certain Lady of the Court.
I do well remember (quoth she) the first dosen years of her Highness reign,
how happy, pleasant and quiet they were, with all manner of comfort and
consolation. There was no mention then of f^ctions in religion, neither was any
man much noted or rejected for that cause: so otherwise his conversation were
civil and cou^teous. No suspicion of treason, no talk of bloodshed, no
complaint of troubles, miseries, or vexations, All was peace, all was love, all
was joy, all was delight. Her M^jestie (I am sure) took more Recreation at that
time in one day, than she does now in a whole week: and we that served her
Highness, enjoyed more contentation in a week, than we can now in diverse
years. For now, there are so many suspicions every where, for this thing, and
for that, as we cannot tell whom to trust. So many melancholic in the Court,
that seem male-contented, so many complaining or suing for their friends that
are in trouble: others slip over the Sea, or retire themselves upon the
sudden: so many tales brought us of this or that danger; of this man
suspected, of that man sent for up, and such l^ke unpleasant, and unsavorie
stuff; as we can never almost be merry one whole day together.

Wherefore (quoth this Lady) we that are of her Majesty's train and special
service, and do not only feel these things in our selves, but much more in
the grief of her most excellent Majesty whom we see daily molested herewith
(being one of the best natures, I am sure, that ever noble Princess was endued
withal:) we cannot but moan, More moderation wished in matters of faction.
to behold contentions advanced so far forth as they are: and we could wish
most heartily that for the time to come these matters might pass with such
peace, friendship, and tranquillity, as they do in other Countries, where
difference in religion breaks not the band of good fellowship. or fidelity.
And with this in a smiling manner she brake off, asking pardon of the company,
if she had spoken her opinion over boldly, like a woman.

To whom answered a Courtier that fate next her: Madame, The speech of a
Courtier.
your L^diship has said nothing in this behalf, that is not daily debated
amongst us, in our common speech in Court as you know. Your desire also he^ein
is a public desire, if it might be brought to p^ss^: for there is no man so
simple, that sees not how perilous these contentions and divisions among us
may be in the end. And I have heard diverse Gentlemen that be lea^^^d,
discourse at large upon this argument: alleging old examples of the Athenians,
Lacedaemonians Carthigenians, The peril of divisions and factions in a
Commonwealth
and Romans, who received notable damages, and destruction also in the end, by
their divisions and factions among themselves, and sp^cially from them of their
own Cities and Countries, who upon factions lived abroad with Forrainers: and
thereby were always as firebrarnds, to carry home the flame of War upon their
Country.

The like they also showed by the long experience of all the great Cities and
States of Italy: which by their factions and forucites, were in continual
gar-boyle, bloodshed and misery. Whereof our own country has also tasted
her part, by the odious contention between the houses of Lancaster and York:
wherein it is marvailous to consider, what trouble a few men oftentimes,
departing out of the Realm, were able to work by the part of their f^ction
r^maining at home (which commonly increases towa^d them that are absent) and
by the readiness of for^ain Princes, to receive ^lw^yes, and comfort such as are
disconten^^^ in another state: to the end, that by their means, they might
hold an Ore in their neighbors boat: Which Prince^ that a^e n^gh borderers,
do always above all other things most covet and desire.

This was that Courtiers speech and reason, whereby I perceived, The dangerous
sequel of dissension in our Realm.
that as well among them in Count, as among us in the R^alme and Coun^ry abroad,
the present i^ conv^nience and dangerous sequel of this our home dis^ention,
is espied, and consequently most English hearts inclined to wish the r^medy or
p^evention thereof, by some reasonable mod^ration, or reunion among our
selves. For that the prosecution of these d^ffer^nces to extr^a^itie, cannot
but after many wounds and exulcerations bring matters finally to rage, fury,
and most deadly desperation.

Whereas on the other side, if any sweet qualification, or small tolleration
among us were admitted: there is no doubt, but that affairs would pass in our
Realm with more quietness, safety and public weal of the same, then it is
like it will do long: and men would easily be brought, that have English
bowels, to join in the preservation of their Country from ruin, bloodshed,
and foreign oppression, which desparation of factions is wont to procure.

I am of your opinion (quoth the Gentleman) in that, for I have seen the
experience thereof, Gentl.
and all the world beholds the same at this day, in all the Countries of
Germany, Polonia, Boe^land, Examples of tolleration in matters of religion.
and Hungary: where a little bearing of the one with the other, has wrought
them much ease, and continued them a peace, whereof all Europe besides has
admiration and envy. The first 12 years also of her Majesty's reign, whereof
your Lady of the Court discoursed of before, Germany.
can well be a witness of the same: wherein the commiseration and lenity that
was used toward those of the weaker sort, with a certain sweet diligence for
their gaining, by good means was the cause of much peace, contentation, and
other benefit to the whole body.

We see in France, that by over much pressing of one part only, The breach
and reunion again in France.
a fi^e was inkindled not many yea^es since, like to have consumed and
destroyed the whole: had not a necess^ry mollification been thought upon by the
wisest of that Kings Council full contrary to the will and inclination of some
great personages, who meant perhaps to have gained more by the other: and since
that time we see what peace, wealth, and reunion has ensued in that Country
that was so broken, dissevered, and wasted before. And all this, by yielding a
litt^e in that thing, which no force can master, but exulcerate rather, and
make worse: I mean the conscience and judgment of men in matters of Religion.

The like also I could name you in Flanders, Flanders.
where after all these broils and miseries of so many years wars (caused
principally by too much streyning in such affairs at the beginning) albeit the
King be never so strict-laced, in yielding to public liberty, and free
exercise on both parts: yet is he descended to this at length (and that upon
force of reason) to abstain from the pursuit and search of men's consciences,
not only in the towns, which upon composition he receives, but also where he
has recovered by force, as in Torney, and other places: where I am informed
that no man is searched, demanded, or molested for his opinion or conscience,
nor any act of Papistry or contrary religion required at their hands, but are
permitted to live quietly to God and themselves, at home in their own houses:
so they perform otherwise their outward obedience and duties to their Prince
and Country. Which only qualification, tollerance, and moderation in our
Realm (if I be not deceived, with many more that be of my opinion) would
content all divis^ons, factions, and parties among us, for their continuance in
peace: be they Papists, Puritans, Familians: or of whatsoever nice difference
or section besides, and would be sufficient to retain all parties within a
temperate obedience to the Magistrate and government, for conservation of their
Country: which were of no small importance to the contentation of her Majesty,
and the weal public of the whole kingdom.

But what should I talk of this thing which is so contrary to the desires and
designements of our puissant Conspirators? Moderation impugned by the conspira.

Cicero. Cateline.


What should Cicero the Senator use persuasions to Captain Cateline, and his
crew, that quietness and order were better than hurliburlies? Is it possible
that our aspirors will ever permit any such thing, cause, or matter, to be
treated in our state, as may tend to the stability of her Majesty's present
government? No surely, it stands nothing with their wisdom or policy,
especially at this instant, when they have such opportunity of following their
own actions in Her Majesty's name, under the vizard and pretext of her defense
and safety: having sowed in every man's head so many imaginations of the dangers
present both abroad and at home: from Scotland, Flanders, Spain, and Ireland:
so man conspiracies, The Conspirators opportunity.
so many intended murders, and others so many contrived or conceived
mischiefs: as my Lord of Leicester assures himself that the troubled water
cannot be cleared again in short space, nor his baits and lines laid therein,
easily espied: but rather, that hereby, ere long, he will catch the fish he
gapeth so greedily after: and in the mean time, for the pursuit of these
crimes, and other that he daily will find out, himself must remain
perpetual Dictator.

But what means this so much inculcating of troubles, treasons, murders, and
invasions? I like not surely these ominous speeches. And as I am out of doubt,
that Leicester the caster of these shadows, does look to play his part first
in these troublesome affairs: so do I heartily fear, that unless the
tyranny of this Leicestrian fury be speedily stopped, that such misery to
Prince and people (which the Lord for his mercies sake turn from us) as never
greater fell before to our miserable Country, is far nearer hand than is
expected or suspect^d.

And therefore for the prevention of these calamities, to tell you plainly mine
opinion (good Sirs) and therewith to draw to an end of this our conference (for
it waxes late: Leycester to be called to account.
) I would think it the most necessary point of all for her Majesty to call
his Lordship to account among other, and to see what other men could say
against him, at length, after so many years of his sole accusing, and pursuing
of others. I know, and am very well assured, that no one act which her Majesty
has done since her coming to the Crown (as she has done right many most
highly to be commended) nor any that lightly her Majesty may do hereafter, can
be of more utility to Her self, and to the Realm, or, more grateful to her
faithful and zealous subjects than this noble act of Justice would be, for
trial of this man's deserts toward his Country.

I say it would be profitable to her Majesty, and to the Realm, no^ only in
respect of the many dangers before mentioned, hereby to be avoided, which are
like to ensue most certainly, if his courses be still permitted: but also for
that her Majesty shall by this, d^liver Her self from that general grudge and
grief of mind, with great dislike, which many subjects, otherwise most
faithful, have conceived against the excessive favor showed to this man so
many years, without desert or reason. Which favor he having used to the hurt,
annoyance, and oppression both of infinite several persons, and the whole
common-weal^h (as has bin said:) the grief and resentment thereof, does
redound commonly in such cases not only upon the person delinquent alone, but
also upon the Sovereign, by whose favor and authority he offers such
injuries, though never so much against the others intent, desire or meaning.

And hereof we have examples of sundry Princes, in all ages and Countries,
whose exorbitant favor to some wicked subject that abused the same, has bin
the cause of great d^nger and ruin; the sins of the favorite being returned
and revenged upon the favourer. As in the History of the Grecians is declared,
by occasion of the pitiful murder of that wise and victorious P. Philip of
Macedony, who albeit, The death K Philip of Macedonie, and cause there of.
that he were well assured to have given no offense of himself to any of his
subjects, and consequently feared nothing, but conversed openly and confidently
among them: yet, for that he had favored too much one ^uke Attalus, a proud
and insolent Courtier, and had born him out in certain of his wickedness, or at
least not punished the same after it was detected and complained upon: the
parties grieved accounting the crime more proper* and heinous on the part of
him, who by office should do justice, and protect other, than of ^he
perpetrator, who follows his own passion and sensuality, let pass Attalus,
and made their ^evenge upon the blood and life of the K himself, by one
Pausanias, suborned for that purpose, Paus^^ias.
in ^he marriage day of the Kings own daughter.

Great store of like examples may be repeated, ^ut of the stories of other
countries, nothing being more usual or frequent among all nations, ^han the
af^lictions of realms and kingdoms, and the overthrow of Princes and great
Potentates themselves, by their too much affection toward some unworthy
particular persons: a thing in deed so common and ordinary, as it may wel^ seem
to be the special Rock of all other, whereat Kings and Princes do make their
shipwracks

For if we look into the states and Monarchy all Christendo^e, and consider
the ruins tha^ have bin of any Princes or Ruler within the same: we shall find
this point to have bin a great and principal part of the cause thereof and in
our own state and country, the matte^ is too evident. Kings of England
ove^t^r^wn by too much favoring of some particular men.
For whereas since the Conque^^ we number principally, three just and lawfu^^
Kings, to have come to confusion, by alienatio^ of their subjects: that is,
Edward the secon^ R^ch. the second, and Henry the sixth: this onl^ point of too
much favor toward wicked persons, was the chiefest cause of destruction in a

the said most impious a^^ sinful Duke to range and make havoc of all sort of
subjects at his pleasure (much after the fashion of the Earl of Leicester now,
though yet not in so high an^ extreme a degree: (this I say was the principal
and original cause, both before Go^ and man, Pol. lib. 23 hist. Angl.
(as Polidore well notes) of all the calamity and extreme desolation, which
after ensued both to the King, Queen, and their only child, with the utter
extirpation of their family.

And so likewise now to speak in our particular case, if there be any grudge or
grief at this day, any mislike, repining, complaint or murmr against her
Majesty's government, in the hearts of her true and faithful subjects, who
wish amendment of that which is amiss, and not the overthrow of that which is
well: (as I trow it were no wisdom to imagine there were none at all:) I dare
avouch upon Conscience, that either all, or the greatest part thereof,
proceeds from this man; who by the favor of her Majesty so afflicts her
people as never did before him, either Gaveston, Spencer, Fere, or Mowbray or
any other mischievous ^irant, that abused most his Princes ^avour within our
Realm of England Whereby it is evident how profitable a thing it should be to
the whole Realm, how honorable to her Maje^^y, and how grateful to all her
subjects, if this man at length might be called to his account.

Si^ (quoth the Lawyer) you allege great reason, Lawyer.
and verily I am of opinion, that if her Majesty knew but the tenth part of
this, which you have here spo^en, as also her good subjects desires and
complaint in this behalf: she would well show, that her Highness fears not
to permit justice to pass upon Leicester, or any other within her Realm, for
satisfaction of her people, whatsoever some men may think and report to the
contrary, or howsoever otherwise of her own mild disposition toward the
person, she have borne with him hitherto. For so we see that wise Princes can
do at times convenient, for peace and tranquillity, and public weal: though
contrary to their own particular and peculiar inclination.

As to go no further then to the last example nam^d and alleged by your self
before: though Queen Margaret the wife of K Henry the sixth, had favored most
unfortunately many years together, The punishment of William Duke of Suffolk.
W^ll^am Duke of Suffolk (as has bin said) whereby he committed manifold
outrages, and afflicted the Realm by sundry means: yet she being a woman of
great prudence, when she saw the whole Communalty demand justice upon him for
his demerits, albeit she liked and loved the man still: yet for satisfaction of
the people, upon so general a complaint, she was content first to commit him
to prison, and afterward to banish him the Realm: but the providence of God
would not permit him so to escape: for that he being incountred and taken upon
the sea in his passage, he was beheaded in the ship, and so received some part
of condign punishment for his most wicked, loose, and licentious life.

And to seek no more examples in this case, and we know into what favor and
special grace Sir Edmond Dudley, my Lord of Leycesters good Grandfather was
crept, with King Henry the seventh, in the latter end of his reign: and what
intolerable wickedness and mischief he wrought against the whole Realm, and
against infinite particular persons of the same, by the polings and oppressions
which he practiced: whereby though the King received great temporal commodity
at that rhyme, The punishment of Edmond Dudley.
(as her Majesty does nothing at all by the present extortions of his Nephew:)
yet for justice sake, and for mere c^mpassion toward his afflicted subjects,
that complained grievously of this iniquity: that most virtuous and wise Prince
King Henry was content to put from him this lewd instrument, and devilish
suggestor of new exactions: whom his son Henry that ensued in the Crown,
caused presently before all other business, to be called publicly to account,
and for his deserts to leese his head: So as where the interest of a whole
Realm, or common cause of many, takes place: the private favor of any one
cannot stay a wise and godly Prince, (such as all the world knows her Majesty
to be) from permitting justice to have her free passage.

Truly it should not (quoth the Gentleman) for to that end were Princes first
elected, Gentl.

The causes why Princes are chosen, and do receive obedience.


and upon that consideration do subjects both pay them tribute and obedience;
to be defended by them from injuries and oppressions, and to see laws
executed, and justice exercised, upon and toward all men with indifferency.
And as for our particular case of my Lord of Leycester, I do not see in right
and equity how her Majesty may deny this lawful desire and petition of her
people. For if her highness do permit and command the Laws daily to pass
upon thieves and murderers without exception, and that for one fact only, as
by experience we see; how then can it be den^ed in this m^n, who in both kinds
has committed more enormous acts, then may be well recounted.

Leycesters Thefts.
As in the first, of theft, not only by spoiling and oppressing almost infinite
private men: but also whole Towns, Villages, Corporations, and Countries, by
robbing the Realm with inordinate licenses, by deceiving the Crown with
racking, changing and imbezeling thn Lands, by abusing his Prince atd
Sovereign in selling his favor both at home and a^road* with taking bribes
for matter of justice, grace, request, supplication, or whatsoever sure else
may depend upon the Court, or of the Princes authority: with se^ting at sale,
and making open market of whatsoever her Majesty can give, do, or procure, be
it spiritual or temp^rall. In which sort of traffic he committ^th more theft
oftentimes in one day than all the way-keepers, cut-purses, conseners, pirates,
burglares, or other of that art in a whole year, within the Realm

And as for the second, which is murder, you have heard before somewhat said
and proved: Leycesters murders.
but yet nothing to that which is thought to have bin in secret committed upon
diverse occasion^ at diverse times, in sundry persons, of different calling in
both sexes, by most variable means of killing, poisoning, charming, enchanting,
conjuring, and the like, according to the diversity of men, places,
opportunities, and instruments for the same. By all which means, I think he
has more blood lying upon his head at this day, crying vengeance against him
at Gods hands, and her Majesty, than ever had private man in our Country
before, were he never so wicked.

Wherein now, if we add his other good behavior, as his intolerable
licentiousness in all filthy kind and manner of carnality, A heap of
Leycesters enormities that would be ready at the day of his trial.
with all sort of Wives, Friends, and Kinsewomen: if we add his injuries aod
dishonours, done hereby to infinite: if we add his treasons, treacheries, and
conspiracies about the Crown; his disloyal behavior, and hatred against her
Majesty, his ordinary lying, and common perjuring himself in all matters for
his gain, both great and small; his rapes and most violent extortions upon the
poor; his abusing of the Parliament and other places of justice, with the
Nobility and whole Communalty besides; if we add also his open injuries which
he offers d^yly to Religion, and the Ministers thereof, by tithing them, and
turning all to his own gain; together with his manifest and known tyranny
practiced toward all estates abroad, throu bout all Shires of the kingdom;
his dispoyling of both the Universities, and d^scouraging of infinite notable
wits there, from seeking perfection of knowledge and learning, (which o^herwise
were like to become notable) especially in Gods word (which gives life unto
the soul,) by defrauding them of the price and reward proposed for their
travail in that kind, through his insatiable Simoniacall contracts: if I say,
we should lay together all these enormities before her Majesty, and thousands
more in particular, which might and would be gathered, if his day of his trial
were but in hope to be granted. I do not see in equity and reason, how her
Highness sitt^^g in throne, and at the royal stern, as she does, could
deny her Subjects this most lawful request; considering, that every one of
th^se crimes apart, requires just^ce of his own nature; and much more all
together ought to obtain the same, at the hands of any good and godly
Magistrate in the World.

No doubt (quoth I but that these considerations must needs weigh much with any
zealous Prince and much more with her most excellent Majesty whose tender heart
toward her Realm and Subjects, Scholar. Her Majesty's tender heart toward
the ^ealme.
is very well known of all men. It is not to be thought also but that her
Highness has intelligence of diverse of ^hese matters alleged, though not
perhaps of all. But what would you have her Majesty to do? perhaps the
consultation of this affair, is not, what were convenient, but what is
expedient: not, what ought to be done in justice, but what may be done in
safety. You have described my Lord before to be a great man, strongly furnished
and fortified for a ^events. What if it be not secure to bark at the Bear that
is so well britched? I speak unto you, but that which I hear in Cambr^dge and
other places where I have passed: where every man's opinion is, that her Majesty
stands not in free choice to do what her self best likes in that case, at
this day.

Gentl. L^ycest^rs desire that men should thnike ^er Majesty? to stand in f^are
of him.
I know said the Gentleman) that Leicesters friends give it out every where that
her Majesty now ^s their good Lords prisoner, and that she eith^r will or mu^^
be directed by him for the time to come, except she will do worse: Which thing
his Lordship is well contented should be spread abroad, and believed for two
causes: the one to hold the people thereby more in awe of himself, than of
their ^overaign: and secondly to d^aw her Majesty indeed by degrees to fear
him. For considering with himself what he has done: and that it is
imp^ssible in truth that ever her Majesty should love him again, or trust him
after so many treacheries as he well knows are com^ to her Highness
understanding: he thinks that he has no way of sure standing, but by terror
and opinion of his puiss^nt greatness; whereby he would hold her Majesty and
the Realm in thraldom, as his father did in his time before him. And then,
for that he well remembers the true saying, Malus custo^ diuturnitatis, metus:
Cicero in Officio.
he mu^t provide shortly, that those which fear him, be not able to hurt him:
and consequently you know what must follow, by the example of K. Edward, who
feared Duke Dudley extremely for that he had cut off his two Uncles heads, A
rule of Machivell observed by the Dudlies
and the Duke took order that he should never live to revenge the same For it
is a settled rule of Machiavel, which the Dudlies do observe: That. where you
have once done a great injury, there must you never forgive.

But I will tell you (my friends) and I will tell you no u^^ruth, Leycester
strong only by her Majesty's favor.
for that I know what I speak herein, and am privy to the state of my Lord in
this behalf, and of men's opinions and affections toward him within the
Realm. Most certain it is, that he is strong by the present favor of the
Prince (as has bin showed before) in respect whereof, he is ^dmitted also as
chief patron of the Huntington faction, though neither loved, nor greatly
trusted of the same: but let her Majesty once turn her countenance aside from
him in good earnest, and speak but the word only, that justice shall take place
against him; and I will undertake with gaging of both my life and little lands
that God has given me, that without ^^ur or trouble, or any danger in the
world, the Bear shall be taken to her Majesty's hand, and fast chained to a
stake, An offer made for taking and tying the Bear.
with mouzell, cord, collar, and ring, and all other things necess^ry: so that
her Majesty shall ba^t him at her pleasure, without all danger of biting,
breaking loose, or any other inconvenience whatsoever.

For (Sirs) you must not think, that this man holds any thing abroad in the
Realm but by violence, and that only upon her Majesty's favor and
countenance toward him. He has not any thing of his own, either from his
ancestors, or of himself, to stay upon, in men's hearts or conceits: he has
not ancient Nobility, as other of our realm have, whereby men's affections are
greatly moved. His father John Dudley was the first noble of his line;
Leicester what he receives from his ancestors
who raised and made himself big by supplanting of other, and by setting
debate among the Nobility: as also his grandfather Edmond, a most wicked
Promoter, and wretched Petifogger, enriched himself by other men's ruins: both
of them condemned Traitors, though different in quality, the one being a
consener, and the other a tyrant, and both of their vices conjoined, collected,
and comprised (with many more additions) in this man (or beast rather) which is
Robert, the third of their kin and kind. So that from his ancestors, this Lord
receives neither honor nor honesty, but only succession of treason and
infamy.

And yet in himself has he much less of good, wherewith to procure himself
love or credit among men, than these ancestors of his had; he being a man
wholly abandoned of humane virtue, and devoted to wickedness, which makes men
edible both to God and man. In his father (no doubt) there were to be seen many
excellent good parts, if they had been joined with faith, honesty, moderation
and loyalty. The comparison of Leycester with his father.
For all the world know^ that he was very wise, valiant, magnanimous, liberal,
and assured friendly where he once promised: of all which virtues my Lord his
son has neither show nor shadow, but only a certain false representation of
the first, being crafty and subtle to deceive, and ingenious to wickedness.
For as for valor, he has as much as has a mouse: his magnanimity is base
sordidity: his liberality rapine: his friendsh^p plain fraud, holding only
for his gain, and no otherwise, though it were bound with a thousand oaths;
of which he makes as great account, as hens do of cackling, but only for his
commodity: using them specially and in gryatest number, when most he means to
deceive. Namely, if he swear solemnly by his George, or by the eternal God,
then be sure it is a false lie: for these are observations in the Court: and
sometimes in his own lodging; in like case his manner is to take up and swear
by the Bible, whereby a Gentleman of good account, and one that seems to
follow him, (as many do that like him but a little) protested to me of his
knowledge, that in a very short space, he observed him wittingly and willingly
to be forsworn sixteen times.

This man therefore so contemptible by his ancestors, so odible of himself, so
plunged, The weakness (...) Leyces^^r if ^er Majesty turn but her counte^^ce
from him.
overwhelmed and defamed in all vice, so envyed in the Court, so detested in
the Country, and not trusted of his own and dearest friends, nay (which I am
privy to) so misliked and hated of his own servants about him, for his
beastly life, nigardy, and Atheism (being never seen yet to say one private
prayer within his chamber in his life) as they desire nothing in this world so
much as his ruin, and that they may be the first, to lay hands upon him for
revenge. This man (I say) so broken both within and without, is it possible
that her Majesty and her wise Council should fear? I can never believe it, or
if it be so, it is Gods permission without all cause, for punishment of our
sins: for that this man, if he once perceive indeed that they fear him, will
handle them accordingly, and play the Bear indeed: which inconvenience I hope
they will have care to prevent, and so I leave it to God, and them, craving
pardon of my Lord of Leicester for my boldness, if I have been too plain with
him. And so I pray you let us go to supper, for I see my servant expecting
yonder at the Gallery door to call us down.

To that, said the Lawyer, I am content with all my heart; Lawyer. The end and
departure from the Gallerie.
and I would it had been sooner, for that I am afraid, lest any by chance have
ov^rheard us here since night. For my own part, I must say, that I have not
been at such a conference this seven years, nor mean to be hereafter, if I
may escape well with this; whereof I am sure I shall dream this fortnight, and
think oftener of my Lord of Leicester, than ever I had intended: God amend him
and me both. But if ever I hear at other hands of these matters hereafter, I
shall surely be quake britch, and think every bush a thief. And with that,
came up the Mistress of the house to fetch us down to supper, and so all was
hushed, saving that at supper a gentleman or two began again to speak of my
Lord, and that so comfortable to some of our former speech (as indeed it is the
common talk at tables every where) that the old Lawyer beg^n to shrink and be
app^led, and to cast dry looks upon the Gentleman ou^ friend, doubting lest
something h^d been discovered of our confe^ence. But indeed it was not so.

A Godly and profitable Meditation, taken out of the 20. Chapter of the Book
of Job.
The wicked man's pomp.
THis I know from the first, that man was placed upon earth, that the praise (or
applause given to wicked men, endures but a little, an^ the joy of an
hypocrite is but for a momen^ Though his pride were so great as to mount t^
heaven, His joy. His pride. His fall.
and his head should touch the skies, ye^ in the end shall he come to
perdition as a dun^hill, and they who beheld him (in glory before shall say,
where is he? he shall be found as a fl^ing dream, and as a fantasy by night
shall (...) away. The eye that beheld him before, shall (...) more see him, nor
yet shall his place (of honor ever more behold him. His children shall be
wor^out with begge^ie, His children. His old age
and his own hands shall r^turne upon him his sorrow. His (ol^) bones (...) be
replenished with the vices of his youth, are they shall sleep with him in his
grave. His bread.
His brea^ in his belly sh^l be turned inwardly into the (...) of Serpents. His
restitution.
The riches which he has devou^^^ he shall vomit forth again, and God shall
(...) them forth of his belly. He shall suck the head (...) Cocatrices, and the
(venomous) ^ongues of add^^ shall slay him* His punishment.
He shall sustain due punishme^^ for all the wickedness that he has committed,
(...) yet shall he have end or consummation thereon He shall suffer according
to the multitude of (...) his wicked inventions. His wickedness.
For that by violence he^ has spoiled the poor, made havoc of his hou^^ and
not builded the same. His womb is never satisfied, and yet when he has that
which he desired, he shall not be able to possess the same. There remains
no part of his meat (for the poor:) and therefore there shall remain nothing
of his goods. His grief.
When his belly is full then shall he begin to be straightened, then shall he
sweat, and all kind of sorrow shall rush upon him. His affliction.
I would his belly were once full, that God might send out upon him the rage of
his fury, and rain upon him his war. He shall fly away from Iron weapons, and
run upon a bow of brass. A drawn sword coming out of his skabard shall flash
as lightning in his bitterness. His damnation.
All da^knesse lie hidden for him in secret: the fire that needs no kindling
shall devour him, and he shall be tormented alone in his tabernacle. His
posterity.
The offspring of his house shall be made open, and pulled down, in the day of
Gods fury. This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and this is the
inheritance of his substance from the Lord.

FINIS.
LEICESTER'S GHOST.

Printed, Anno Dom. MDCXLI.

LEICESTER'S GHOST.
J That sometimes shined like the orient Sun,
Though Fo^tun^s subject, yet a puissant Lord,
Am now an object to be gazed upon,
An abject rather fit to be deplored
Dejected now that whilome was adored:
Affected once, suspected since of many
Rejected now, re^pected scarce of any.
My Spirit hovering in the foggie air
Since it did pass the frozen Stygian flood,
Unto great Brit^ines Empire did repair;
Where of ELIZA's death I understood,
And that the heavens careful of Englands good
Raised up a King, who crowned with loves peace
Brought in new soyes and made old griefs to cea^^
Thus from the concave vaults of starlesse night
Where neither sun nor moon vouchsaf^ to shire
My wretched Ghost a^ length is come to light
By char^ers granted from the powers divine
Snake-eating envy, o do not repine
At honou^s-sh^dow, do not bite the dead,
My pride is past, my pomp from the earth is fle^
My Princely birth, my high enobled state
My somtime-dreadfull frowns now none regard;
My great good-turnes to many done of late
With grateful hearts, now few or none reward
My fame is blotted out, my honor scared;
My monuments defaced, my relics torn
Yea, vass^iles do my Excellency scorn.
Ah silly peasants, as each Greeian boy,
Would brave stout Hector being dead and cold,
That whilome was the pillar of old Troy,
Whose presence living they durst scarce behold,
Now since you see me dead you grow so bold,
As to control my acts, whose looks did daunt
The proudest Peers that lived in Troyn^vant.
A time there was, when stately Bears could clime,
And in that time, was I a stately Bear;
Who climbed so fast and in a little time,
That my high mounting other beasts did fear
My fortunes, by their downfals I did rear:
I now rejoice, whilst others I made mourn,
And served the time to make time serve my ^urne.
I was the offspring of a Princely Sire
He too well knew by his clime-falling pride
Like Delalus he taught me to aspire;
We both did fly* he fell, I did but slide;
Like in attempts, yet unlike chance we tried:
He by a Queen did dye, and as that chanced,
I by a Queen did live, and was advanced.
For Lady lane by him a Queen proclaimed
Was soon suppressed, Queen Mary got the Crown,
Which as her proper right she boldly claimed,
My Father strived in vain to keep her down,
And for that lost his life, I my renown,
Till sacred Cynthia to the Kingdom came,
That gave new life to my lat^ dying fame.
That Peerless Queen of happy memoty
That late like Debora the Kingdom swaid,
Now triumphs in the Jasper colored sky
With starre-embrodered vesture rich arrayed;
She, she restored my honors then decayed
When treason did attaint my Fathers blood,
And drowned our Princely race in Lethes flood.
Then Jupiter was in my Horoscope
And Cinthia blessed me with her fair aspect,
What might not then my youth and courage hope
When me my Sovereigns favor did protect,
O what may not a Princess grace effect
When Majesty on hopeless men does smile
Whose joys did seem to perish in exile.
Even when Queen Mary's tragic Reign did end
My comic fortunes in their prime begun
That tim^ when Cinthia's brightness did extend
To lighten this dark Land whose splendant Sun
Was in Eclipse and sorrows stream did run
I like the glorious day star did appea^e
With fair uprise, to grace this Hemispheare.
Since Brute first swayed all this united Land
No Subject firmer held his Sovereigns grace,
My will imperial for a Law did stand,
Such was my Princes pleasure, such my place,
As Momus durst not offer me disgrace;
What man did smile when Leisters brow did frown
Whose wit could guide, though never get the Crown
Whilst in this glorious Ocean I did swim
To high preferment diverse men I brought,
Which since have fought my Honors Lamp to dim,
Yea such as I before advanced of naught
Against my person treacheries have wrought,
Thus honors do oft-times good manners change,
And men grown rich to ancient friends grow strange.
I grieve to think, I did such men advance
And raise their base lines to a stately pitch
Under the shadow of my countenance
The substance of the Earth did make them rich,
What fury did their senses thus bewitch,
Or was it some ill Spirit that possessed them?
To seek my ruin, whose large bounty blessed them.
Thus they in vain my downfall did conspire
Like dogs that at the Moon do fondly bark
And did but burn themselves like Aetna's fire,
Or like grim Owls did wonder in the dark
Contem'd of me that mounted like the Lark,
Or that rare bird that builds her nest on high
In Cedar Trees whose tops affront the sky.
When I commanded who durst countermand
Were not mean subjects, subject to my beck,
What man of worth my pleasure did with-stand,
What simple swains could do, I did not wreake
I gave the mate to those that gave me ch^ck
By the Queens help and threatening looks
I ruled the pawnes, the Bishops, Knigh^s, and Rooks.
Thus did I play at Chesse and won the g^me
Having the queen my puissance to support,
The Bishops for ambition did me blame
The pawnes affirmed I wan by much extort
The Rooks and Knights found draughts to man my sport,
Had not some stopped me with ^h^ir timely check^,
I might have given them che^k without their ne^k^.
My brain had wit, my tongue was eloquent
Fit to discourse or tell a Cou^^ly tale
My presence portly brave M^gnificent,
My words imperious, stout, substantial
My gestures loving, kind, Heroical;
My thoughts ambitious, proud, and full of i^e,
My deeds were good or bad as times require
Some of my foes that bare me deadly hate,
That had to them chief Offices assigned,
And were my fellow Consuls in the State
^ealous still of my aspiring mind
Gave me this praise though otherwise unkind,
That I was wondrous politic and wise,
A Statesman that knew how to temporise.
Some othe^s took me for a zealous man
Because good P^eachers I did p^tronize,
And many thought me a Precisian
But God does know, I never was precise
I seemed devout in godly exercise:
And by Religions show confirmed my might
But who du^st say, I was an hypoc^ite.
As Ni^ma when he first did seek to draw
The Roman people und^rneath his yoke,
Touch^ng Religion he ordained a Law
And f^yned he with Nymph Egeria spoke
That him to thi^ good motion did provoke:
Whereby as if it were with heavens consent
He brought his men to civil government.
So when I came in h^gh affairs to deal
Of sound Religion I did make a show
And by pretense of hot and ferven^ zeal
In wealth and faction I mo^e strong did grow
For this by practice I did plainly know;
That m^n are apt to yield to any motion
Made by a m^n that is of pu^e devotion.
Yet could I strain my Conscience for a need,
For though I seemed an earnest Protestant
For g^ine I favored Papist so indeed,
Some held me for a newter, and I grant
To serve my turn I would turn Puritant:
Thus by Religion, honor some do win
And this fai^e cloak often covers filthy sin.
Like as the ayre-sucking-Chamelion
Can him transform to any hue save white;
So men can turn to any fashion
Save to that form which is sincere and right,
For though he may delude the peoples sight,
It is in vain before God to dissemble
Whose power the Divel^ know, and knowing trem^^^
Was I the only man that has offended
In making holiness a cloak for sin?
The Frenchmen for religions sake pretended
Their civil Wars of late time did begin,
But yet ambition chiefly drew them in,
Ye^ mad ambition, and desire of gain
Makes endless broils betwixt the States and Spain
Of promises, I was so prodigal,
So kind, well spoken, and so liberal,
That to some great Divine as it might fall
Perhaps I promised a Bishopric,
But in performance I was nothing quick;
Thus with fair wo^ds, men's humors often I fed
Whilst hope this while a good opinion bred.
To learned Scholars I was something franck
Not for the love that I to lea^ning bore,
But either to get praise or pick a thank
Of such as could the Mus^s aid implore
To consecrate my name for evermore;
For he is blessed that so befriended dies
Whose praise the Mus^s will immortalize.
You that desire to have your fame survive
When you within your graves entombed shall lie,
Cherish those sacred Sisters while you live
For they be daughters of Dame memory
Of ^he thund^ing Monarch of the sky:
They have the gift to register with pen
The eternal fame or infamy of men.
The Students of the University
Oxford whereof I was the Chancellor,
That Nurse of science and Philosophy
Knowing the greatness of my wit and power
Did honor me as the fair springing flower;
That in the Princess favor highly grew
Whom she with show^rs o^ gold did of b^dew.
At my command both Dee and Allen tended
By Magic Art my pleasure to fulfill
These to my service their best studies bended,
And why they durst not disobey my will,
Yea whatsoever was of secret skill
In Oxford or in Cambridge to be sold
I bought for love, for fear, or else for gold.
Doubtless the most renowned Philosophers
As Plato and Pithagoras have sought
To learn the Hierogliphick Characters
And secrets which by Magic skill are wrought,
Such as The Egyptians, sewes, and Chaldees taught:
Th'art's not ill if men do not abuse it,
No fault so bad, but some men will excuse it.
Lopus and Iulio were my chief Physicians,
Men that were cunning in the Art to kill
Good Scholars but of passing ill conditions,
Such as could rid men's lives yet no blood spill,
Yea and with such dexterity and skill
Could give a dram of poison that could slay
At end of the year, the month, the week or day*
I never did these wicked men employ
To wrong my Prince or my true loving friend
But false deceitful wretches to destroy
And bring them to an unexpected end
Let them look to it that did most offend,
Whose names are Registered in Pluto's scroules,
For I will never answer for their souls.
Knights and Esquires the best in every shire
Did wait on me in England up and down,
And some among them did my Livery wear
My smiles did seem to promise them renown,
But dismal haps insu'd when I did frown
As when the star Arcturus does appear
Of raging Tempests Seamen stand in fear.
As for the Soldiers and the men of war
At home in service some I did retain,
Others I sent abroad not very far
At my commandment to return again,
These I with cost did secretly maintain
That if ought chanced otherwise then well,
I might have sent my foes to heaven or hell.
Likewise I brought the Lawyers in some awe,
The worthy students of the Innes of court,
That then applied them to the common Law,
Did yield to me in matters of import,
Although sometimes I did the Law exto^t,
And whether right or wrong, my cause once heard,
To plead against me made great Lords afeard.
So the Lord Barkley, lost good lands by me,
Whereof perchance at first he did not dream,
Might many times does overcome the right,
It is in vain to strive against the stream,
When he that is chief subject in the Realm,
Upon his Princes favor rests him bold,
He cannot or he will not be controld.
Thus by the Queen my puissance was upheld,
And for my foes I ever was too strong,
The grace I had from her all fear expeld,
I might wrong others, but not suffer w^ong,
So many men did unto me belong,
Which on my favor chiefly did depend,
And for my sake both goods, and land would spend.
The best esteemed Nobles of the land.
On whose support the public state relied,
Were linckt with me in friendships faithful band,
Or else in kindred nerely were allied,
Their perfect loves and constant hearts I tried,
The inferior sort at our devotion stood
Ready to execute what we thought good.
The Earl of Warwick my own loving brother
My sisters Husband The Earl of Huntington,
The bounteou^ Earl of Bedford was another
Of my best friends beloved of every one
Sir Henry Sidneys power in Wales well known*
And there the Earl of Pembroke chief of all
Of kin^e my ^^iend what ever thence might fall
In Barwic^ my wives Uncle had chief power
The Lord of Hunsdon my assured f^iend,
In Ireland the Lord Gray was Governor,
Gernsey and Iersey, likewise did depend
Upon such men, as did my will attend:
Hopton my man Lieutenant of the Tower
Was prompt to do me service at an hour.
Sir Edward Horsey in the Isle of Wight
And noble Sir George C^^y next bore sway,
Men of great courage and no little might
To take my part in any doubtful fray
In London the Recorder Fleetwood lay:
That often used good words that might incense
The Citizens to stand in my defense.
The Premises did likewise take my part
As I in private quarrels often have tryde,
So that I had the very head and heart
The Court and City leaning on my side,
With flattery some, others with gifts I plyd,
And some with threats, stern looks and angry words.
I won to my defense with Clubs and Swords.
Thus I by wisdom and fine poilicie,
Maintained the reputation of my life,
Drawing to me the flower of Chivalrie
To succor me at need in civil strife
Men that loved change in every place were rife:
And all the realm was with my power possessed
Think what this might have wrought but judge the best.
Like Claudius Marcellus drawn through Rome
In his fair chariot which with Trophies decked,
Crowned with Garlands by the Senates doom,
Whom they five times their Consul did elect
That from their foes he might their lives protect:
When he wi^h conquest did his Country greet
Laden with spoils lay prostrate at his feet.
So did I ride in triumph through chief towns
As if I had been Viceroy of this Land,
My face well graced with smiles, my purse with crowne^
Holding the reins of honor in my hand,
I managed the state, I did command:
My looks with humble majesty repleat,
Made some men wish me a Kings royal seat.
Thus waxt I popular to purchase fame
To me the common peoples knees did bow,
I could my humor still so fitly frame
To entertain all men to outward show
With inward love, for few my heart did know:
And that I might not seem puffed up with pride
Bare-headed often through Cities I did ride.
While some cried out, God save you gracious Lord,
Lord how they did my fame hyperbolize
My words and gestures did so well accord
As with their hearts I seemed to simpathize,
I charmed their ears and did inchant their eyes:
Thus I was reckoned their chief Potentate
No poller but a pillar of the st^te.
Then I was called the life and the heart o'th'Court
And some I wot wished I had been the head,
I had so great a train and such a port,
As did the pomp of Martimer exceed,
Who as in The English Chronicles we read,
When second Edward lost his Kingly rights
Was waited on at once with nine-score Knights.
That Earl of March and Roger Mortimer,
Ruled the young King, queen mother, and the Peers
I Robert Dulley Earl of Leicester,
Did sway in court and all the English steeres,
His rule was short, mine flourisht many years
He did his life with ignominy loose,
I lived and triumphed over my proudest foes.
As the Image of great Alexander dead,
Made king Cassander tremble at the sight,
Spying the figure of his Royal head,
Whose presence sometime did the world affright,
Or like as Caes^rs Monarchising spright,
Pursued false Brutus at Philipp^s field,
Till he that slew his Liege himself was killed.
So view ye petty Lords my Princely ghost,
I speak to you whose hearts be full of gall,
I whilst I lived was honored of the most,
And either feared for love of great and small,
Or loved for fear of such as wished my fall,
Behold my shadow representing state,
Whose person sometime did your pride abate.
Weigh what I was, knights, gentlemen, and Peers,
When my death threatening frowns did make you quake
As yet they have not passed many years,
Since I your plumes plucked, iofty crest's did shake
Then tell me Sirs, for old acquaintance sake,
Wax ye not pale to hear of Leisters name,
Or to backebite me blush ye not for shame.
You say in dealings that I was unjust,
As if true Justice balance ye could guide,
Had I dealt justly I had turned to dust
Long before this, your corpse swollen up with pride,
Which now surviving do my acts deride,
My fame yet lives though death abridgd my days,
Some of you di'd that over-liu'd your praise.
Are there not some among you Parasites,
Time-servers, and observers of no measure,
Prince-pleasers, people-pleasers, hypocrites,
Dambd Machiavilians given to lust and pleasure,
Church-robbers, beggars of the Princes treasure,
Truce Breakers, Pirates, Athiests, Sicophants,
Can equity, dwell here where conscience wants.
And yet you think none justly deals but you,
Divine Astrea up to heaven is fled,
And turned to Libra, there look up and view
Her balance in the zodiac figured,
Just Aristides once was banished,
Where lives his match whom envy did pursue-
Because men thought he was to just and true.
Ye say, ambition harbourd in my brain,
I say ambition is no heinous sin
To men of state, do stately thoughts pertain,
By baser thoughts what honor can he win,
Who ever did a great exploit begin,
Before ambition moved him to the deed
And hope of honor, urged him to proceed.
Themistocles had never put to flight,
Zerxzes huge host, nor tamed the Persians pride,
Nor sad King Tarsus got by martial fight,
The Roman spoils with conquest on his side,
If first ambition had not been their guide,
Had not this humor their stout hearts allure,
To high attempts their fame had been obscure.
The Eagle does disdain to catch poor flies,
The Lion with the Ape does scorn to play,
The Dolphin does the whirlpoole low despise,
Thus if Birds, Beasts, and Fishes bear such sway,
If they would teach underlings to obey,
Much more should men whom reason does adorn,
Be noble minded and base fortunes scorn.
Admit I could dissemble wittily,
This is no grievous sin in men of state;
D^ssembling is a point of policy
Plain dealing now grows stale and out of date:
Wherefore I often concealed my private hate
Till I might find fit time though long I stayed
To wreake the wrath that in my heart I laid.
The Old Proverb is, plain dealing is a jewel,
And he that uses it a Beggar dies,
The world is now adays become so cruel
That Courtiers do plain C^untry-men despise,
Quick wits and cunning heads do quickly rise.
And to be plain, ye must not plainly deal
That office seek in Court or Commonweal.
Now Aristippus is in more request
That knew the way to please a Monarchs mind,
Then that poor cynicke swad that used to jest
At every idle knave that he could find,
To unkind friends ye must not be too kind:
This is a maxim which to you I give,
Men must dissemble or they cannot live.
Ye say, I was a coward in the field,
I say it fits not such a noble wight
To whom his Country does the title yield
Of Lord Lieutenant with full power and might
To venture his own person in the fight:
Let others dye, which as our vassailes serve
While heaven for better haps our hopes preserve.
How soon did Englands joy in France diminish
When the Earl of Salisbury at Orleance
By Gunshot stroke, his honored life did finish;
When Talb^t that did oftentimes advance
The English ensigns in disgrace of France,
Was at the last environed and slain
Whose name the French-mens terror does remain
And what a fatal wound did Rome receive
By Crassus death whom faithless Parthians slew,
How did the Senate for Flam^nius grieve
And for Aemilius death, and his stout crew,
Whom Haniball at Cannes d^d subdue:
Cut often an arm, yet life the heart may cherish
Cut of the head and every part will perish.
Ip^crates th'Athenian used to say,
Vaunt-currers are like hands to bauell pressed
The men of arms are feet whereon to stay,
The footmen as the stomach and the b^est,
The captain as the head above the rest:
The head once cras^d troubles all the parts,
The General slain does kill ten thousand hearts.
Therefore a Lord Lieutenant should take care
That he in safety do himself repose
And should not hazard life at every dare,
But watch and wa^d, so F^bius tired his foes
When rash Min^t^us did the conquest lo^^:
If such in open danger will intrude
It is fond rashness and not fortitude.
Ye say, I was lascivious in my love
And that I tempted many a gallant Dame,
Not so content, but I did also prove
To win their handmaids if I liked the game,
Wh^ si^^ ye know, love kindl^s such a flame
As if we may believe what Poets pen
It does inchant the hearts of Gods and men.
Jove loved the daughter of a jealous si^e
Danae a maid immured within a tower,
Yet to accomplish the end of his desire
He metamorphiz'd to a golden shower
Fell in the lap of his fair Paramour:
And being termed a god did not disdain
To turn to man, to beast, and shower of rain.
Dear Lords, when Cupid throws his fiery dar^s
Does none of them your tender bodies hit,
Does Citherea never charm your hearts,
Nor beauty try your quintessentiall wit
Perhaps you will say no, fie it is unfit,
Now by my Garter, and my Geo^ge to ^oot,
The blind God surely hits, if he does shoot.
Whereas ye do object my Magic charms,
I sought to win fair dames to my desire,
It Is better so then strive by force of Arms
For forced love will quickly back retire
If fair means cannot win what we requi^e:
Some secret tricks and sleights must be devised
That love may even from Hell be exercised,
To you dull wit it seems impossible
By drinks or charms this work to pass to bring*
Know then that Giges were invisible
By turning the sigill of his Ring
Toward his palm and thereby slew the King,
Lay with his wife of any man unseene
Lastly did reign by marrying with the queen.
King Solomon for Magic natural
Was held a cunning man by some Divines,
He wrote a book of Science natural
To bind ill Spirits in their dark confines
He had great store of wives and Concubines,
Yet was a Sacred King, this I infer
The wisest man that now does live may err.
Also ye say, that when I waxed old
When age and time misspent had made me dry,
For ancient, held in carnal Lust is cold,
Natures defect with Art I did supply
And that did help this imbecility,
I used strong drinks and Ointments of great price,
Whose taste or touch might make dead flesh arise
To this I answer: that those fine extractions,
Drams and electuaries finely made,
Served not so much to help veneriall actions,
As for to comfort nature that is decaid:
Which being with indifferent judgment weighed,
In noble men may be allowed I trust,
As tending to their health, not to their lust.
What if I drink nothing but liquid gold,
Lactrina, crystal, pearl resolved in wine,
Such as The Egyptians full cups did hold,
When Cleopatra with her Lord did dine;
A trifle, care not, for the cost was mine?
What if I gave Hippomenes to drink
To some fair Dames, at small faults you must wink*
Ye say I was a traitor to the Queen,
And that when Monsieur was in greatest grace,
I being out of favor, moved with spleen,
To see a Frenchman frolique in the place,
Forth toward Barwick then did post apace,
Minding to raise up a rebellious rout,
To take my part in what I went about.
That I was then a traitor I deny,
But I confess that I was Monsieurs foe,
And sought to break the league of amity,
Which then betwixt my Prince and him did grow,
Doubting Religion might be changed so,
Or that our Laws and customs were in danger*
To be corrupt or altered by a stranger:
Therefore I did a faction strong maintain,
Against the Earl of Suss^x, a stout Lord
On Monsieurs side, and then Lord Chamberlain,
Who sought to make that nuptial accord,
Which none may break, witness the sacred Word^
But thus it ch^nced, that he strived in vain
To knit that k^ot which heaven did not ordain.
Thus did ye mis-interpret my concei^s,
That for disloyalty my de^ds did blame,
Yet many men have laid their secret baits,
T'intrap me in such snares to work my shame,
Whom I in time sufficiently did tame;
And by my Sovereigns favor bore them down,
Proving my self true Liegeman to the Crown.
Think ye I could forget my Sovereign Lady,
That was to me so gracious and so kind?
How many triumphs for her glory made I?
O I could never blot out of my mind,
What Characters of grace in her have shined.
But some of you, which were by her p^efer'd,
Have with her bones almo^^ her name interred.
When she was gone, which of you all did weep?
What mournful song did P^ilomela sing?
Al^s! when she in deaths cold bed did sleep,
Which of you all her doleful knell did ring?
How long w^ll ye now love your crowned King,
If you so soon forget your old Queen dead,
Which four and forty years has governed?
Ye say, I sought by murder to aspire,
And by strong poison many men to slay,
Which as ye thought might cross my high desire,
And ^loud my long expected golden day,
Perhaps I laid some blocks out of my way,
Which hindered me from coming to the Bower,
Wh^re Cynthia shined like lamps in Pharohs tower.
Alas! I came not of a Tigers kind,
My hands with blood I hated to defile;
But when by good experience I did find,
How some with fained love did me beguile,
Perchance all pity then I did exile;
And as it were against my will, was pressed
To seek their deaths that did my life detest.
Lo then, attend to hear a doleful tale
Of those whose death y^e do suppose I wrought,
Yet wish I that the world believe not all
That has of me by envious men been wrought,
But when I for a Kingly fortune sought,
O pardon me, my self I might forget,
And cast down some, my state aloft to set.
My first wife fell down from a pair of stairs,
And brake her neck, and so at Comner died,
Whilst her true servants led with small affairs,
Unto a Fure at Abingdon did ride,
This dismal hap did to my wife betide;
Whether ye call it chance or destiny,
Too true it is, she d^d untimely dye.
O had I now a showr^ of tears to shed,
Locked in the empty circles of my ^yes,
All could I shed in mourning for the dead,
That lost a spouse so young, so fair, so wise,
So fair a corpse so foul a coarse n^w lies,
My hope to have married with a famous Queen,
Drove pity back, and kept my tears unseene.
What man so fond that would not lose a Pearl
To find a Diamond, leave brass for gold:
Or who would not forsake a gallant gitle,
To win a Queen, great men in awe to hold,
^o rule ^he ^tate, and of none be controlled?
O but the st^ps that lead unto a ^hrone,
A^e d^ngerous for men to tread upon.
The Cardinal Chatillion was my foe,
Whose death peradventure did compact,
Because he let Queen Eliz^beth to know
My false report given of a former act,
How I with her had made a precontract.
And the great Princes hope I barred thereby,
That s^ught to marry with her Majesty.
The Prelate had bin better held his tongue,
And kissed his holy Fathers feet in Rome:
A Mass the sooner for his soul was sung;
But he might thank me, had he staid at home,
Or late or never he to heaven had come:
Therefore I sent him nimbly from the coasts,
Perhaps to supper with the Lord of hosts.
When death by hap my first wives neck had cracked,
And that my suit unto the Queen ^ll sped,
It cha^ced that I made a post contract,
And did in sort the L^dy Sheff^^ld wed,
Of whom I had two goodly children bred:
For the Lord Sheffeild died as I was sure,
Of a Catarie, which physic could not cure.
Some think the rhume was artificial,
Which this good Lord before his end did take:
Tush, what I gave to her was natur^ll,
My plighted troth yet some amends did make,
Though her at length, unkind I did fors^ke;
She must not blame me, for a higher reach
Made my sure promise find a sudden breach.
The valiant Earl whom absent I did wrong,
In breaking Hymeneus holy band;
In Ireland did protract the time too long,
Whilst some in ^ngland ingled under hand,
And at his coming homeward to this land
He dyed with poison, as they say, infected,
Not without cause, for vengeance I susp^cted:
Because this fact notorious scandal bred,
And ^or I did his gallant wife abuse;
To salve ^his sore when this brave Lord was dead,
I for my self did this fair Lady choose,
And flesh is frail, dear Lady me excuse;
It was pure love that made me undertake,
This hapless recontract with thee to make.
Now in Joves palace that good Lord does sup,
And drink^ full bowls of Nector in the sky.
Hunnies his p^ge, that tasted of that cup,
Did only loose his h^ire, and did not dye;
True-noble Earl, thy fame to heaven does fly.
He does repent his fault, and p^rdon crave,
That marred thy bed and too soon made thy grave.
Thou did behind thee leave a matchless Son,
A peerel^sse pattern for all princ^ly peers,
Whose spa^ks of glory in my time begun,
Kindled with hope fl^m'd highly in few years,
But death him stru^k, and drowned this land in tears;
His Son does live true im^ge of him dead,
To grace this soil, wh^re showers of tears were shed.
They were to blame that said the Queen should marry
With me her Horse keeper, for so they called me.
But thou Throgmarton which ^his tale did carry
From France to England, have more sh^rply galled me,
Since my good Q^eene in office high extold me;
For I was M^ster of her Highness Horse,
I scorn thy words, which did my hate enforce.
But tell me then, how did thou lik^ thy fare,
When I to supper last did thee invite?
If I did rid thee of a world of care,
By giving ^hee a Salet, gentle Knight,
With ghastly looks do not my soul affr^ght*
Lester I was, whom England once did dread,
But now I am like thee Throgmarton, dead.
My Lord of Sussex was too choleric,
That called me traitor and a traitors son;
But I served him a fine Italian tri^k;
Had not I done so, I had bin undone;
Now mark the end, what conquest has he won?
A little scruple that to him I sent,
Did purge his choler, till h^s life was spent.
He was a gallant Noble man indeed;
O but his life did still my life decrease:
Therefore I sent him with convenient speed,
To rest amongst his ancestors in peace:
^y rage was pacified at his decease.
And now I come t'imbrace his love too late,
Him did I love, whom living I did hate.
I came to visit as I chanced to walk
My Lady of Lenox, whom I found not well,
I took her by the hand, h^d private talk,
And so departed, a short tale to tell:
When I was gone, into a flux she fell,
That never ceast her company to keep,
Till it had brought her to a senseless sleep.
I dreamed she had not many days to live;
And this my dream did shortly fall out true,
So as her Ghostly Father I did give
Some comfort to her soul: for well I knew
That she would shortly bid the world adieu.
Some say I gave such physic as did spill her;
But I suppose that m^ere conceit did kill her.
Some will object perhaps, I did pretend
To meet the Earl of Ormond on a day,
In single fight our quarrel for to end;
But did command my servant Killygray,
To lie in ambush that stout Lord to slay.
But heaven did not consent to work his spoil,
That was the glory of the Irish soil.
Perh^ps I doubted that I was too weak,
And loath I was he should the conquest win:
If in this cause I did my promise break,
I hope men will not count it for a sin;
Is it not g^od to sleep in a whole skin?
When Hannibal could not prevail by blows,
He used stratagems to kill his foes.
If I the death of Monsieur Simiers fought,
When he from France Amb^ssadour was sent,
I had just cause to seek it as I thought;
For toward me he bore no good intent;
Had he not fled betimes, perhaps I meant
To Have sent him in embassage for my pleasure
To the black king that keeps Avernus treasu^e.
For when no man about the Court durst speak,
That I the Lady Lettice married,
This prattling Frenchman first the ice did break,
And to the Qu^ene the fact discovered;
Which not without just cause the anger bred:
Thus th'ape did play his part controlled of none,
When he espied the Bear from home was gone.
One Salvadore an Italian borne,
Having once w^t^ht with me till midst of night,
Was found slain in his bed the next day morn:
Alas poor man I ru^ his woeful plight,
That did in nothing but in sin de^ight:
Had he to honest actions bent his wit,
He might have longer lived and escaped this fit.
But what reward should such a man expect,
Whom gold to any lewdness could entice,
Ones turn once served, why should we not reject
So vilde an instrument of damned v^ce?
What if he were disp^tched in a trice?
Was it not better this man's blood to spill,
Then let him live the world with sin to ^il?
I doubted lest that D^ughty would bewray
My counsel, and with others party t^ke;
Wherefore, the sooner him to rid away,
I sent him forth to sea with Captain D^^k^,
Who knew how t'entertain him for my sake;
Before he went his lot by me was c^st,
His death was plotted, and performed in have.
He hoped well; but I did so dispose,
That he at Port St. Julian lost his head,
Having no time permitted to disclose
The inward griefs that in his heart were bred:
We need not fear the biting of the dead:
Now let him go transported to the seas,
And tell my secrets to th'Antipodes.
My servant Gates did speed as ill or worse,
To whom I did my close intents impart,
And at his need with money stuffed his purse,
And wil'd him still take courage at his heart;
Yet in the end he felt the deadly smart:
He was inveigled by some subtle witted,
To rob; so he was taken and committed.
Of pardon I did put him still in hope,
When he of felony was guilty found,
And so condemned, till his last friend the Pope
Did him uphold from falling to the ground.
What hope of grace where vice did so abound.
He was beguiled like birds that use to gape
At Z^uxes table for a painted grape.
Yet I did to the man no injury,
And gave him time and leisure to repent,
And well he knew he had deserved to dye,
Therefore all future mischief to prevent,
I let him slip away with my consent:
For his reprivall, l^ke a crafty Fox,
I sent no pardon but an empty Box.
Else as unfaithful Banester betrayed
The Duke of Buckingh^m his Master dear,
When he of Richards tyranny afraid,
Fled to his servants house for succor there:
So might my man for gain, or forced for fear,
Have brought my corpse with shame unto my grave,
By too much trusting on a paltry knave.
Me seems at me great Norfolkes Duke does frown,
Because he thinks I did his death contrive,
Persuading some he aimed at the Crown,
And that by royal match he meant to strive
A kingdom to his Lordship to revive.
Alas good Duke! he was too meek and mild,
And I too faithless that his trust beguiled.
For that I found his humor first was bent
To take the Scots captived Queen to wife,
I ^gg'd him on to follow his intent,
That by this means I might abridge his life,
And she a crowned Queen to stint all strife,
First finding Scotland lost, to England fled,
Where she in hope of succor lost head.
O blessed Spirits, live ye evermore
I^ heavenly Sion, where your maker reigns,
And give me leave my fortunes to deplore,
That am fast fetterd with sins iron chains.
Man's most sweet joys are mixed with some foul pains.
And does he live of high or low degree,
In life or death that can from woe be free?
Ah now my tongue grows weary to recite
Such m^ssa^res as have been here expressed,
Whose sad remembrance does afflict my spright,
Me thinks I see legions of souls to rest
In Abraham's bosom, and my self oppressed.
The burden of my sins do weigh me down,
At me the fiends do laugh, and Angels frown.
My crimes I grant were geat and manifold,
Yet not so heinous as men make report,
But flattering Parasites are grown so bold
That they of Princes matters make a sport,
To please the humors of the vulgar sort:
And that poor peevish giddiheaded crew,
Are prone to credit any tale untrue.
Let those that live endeavor to live well,
Left after death like mine their guilt remain;
Let no man think there is no Heaven or Hell,
Or with the impious Sadduces maintain
That after death no flesh shall rise again:
Let no man trust on Fortunes fickle wheel,
The guerdon due for* ^^ne I partly feel.
Know that the Prince of heavenly Saraphins,
When he against his Creator did rebel,
Was tumbled down for his presumptuous sin;
Satan that once was blessed like lightning fell
From the highest heaven, to the deepest hell:
And all those Angels that his part did take,
Have now their portion in the burning lake.
Of mighty heaps of treasure I could vant,
For I reapt profit out of every thing,
I could the Prince and peoples hearts inchant.
With my fair words and smooth faced fl^ttering,
And out of dross pure gold I often did wring:
For though the means to win be often unmeet,
The smell of lucre ever smells sweet.
So I sometimes had very much good hap
Great suites of my dread Sovereign to obtain,
Prodigal fortune powered down from her lap,
Angels of gold as thick as drops in rain.
Such was my luck to find the golden vein;
Likewise with me it seemed nothing strange,
Both tents and lands often with my Prince to change.
I had another way t'inrich my self
By geting licenses for me alone,
For Wine, Oil, Velvet, Cloth, and such like pelf,
By licenses to alienation,
By raising rents, and by oppression:
By claiming Forests, Pastures, Commons, Woods,
And forfeiture of lands, of life and goods.
By this strong course also I greatly thrived
Jn falling out with my dear Sovereign,
For I the Plot so cunningly contrived,
That reconcilement soon was made again,
And by this means great gifts I did obtain:
For that I might my bags the better fill,
I begged great suites as pledge of new goodwill.
Besides sometimes I did increase my store,
By benefit that I from Oxford took,
Electing heads of houses heretofore,
I loved their money, and they loved their book,
Some poorer though more learned I forsook:
For in those days your charity was cold,
Little was done for love, but much for gold.
Doubtless my Father was a valiant Peer
In Edwa^d the sixth days when he was sent,
Against Rebels that did rise in Norfolk shire.
And after that when he to Scotland went,
Under the Lord Protectors Regiment;
By notable exploits against the S^ot,
Eternal glory to himself he got.
Truly ambition was his greatest fault,
Which commonly in noble hearts is bred,
He thought the never could his slate exalt
Till the good Duke of Sumerset was dead,
Who by my Fathers means did lose his head:
So ill the race of Dudlies could endure
The Seymors lives which did their fame obscure.
When once King Edward (...) the butt had shot,
My Father, said, your Grace shoots near the mark,
The King replied, but not so near I wot,
As when you shot my Uncles head off quite:
The duke my Father knew the King said right,
And that he meant this matter to debate
If ere he lived to come to man's estate.
It seems my Father in times past had been
A skillfull Archer, though no learned clerk,
So strange a chance as this is seldom seen,
I do suppose h^ shot not in the dark,
That could so quickly hit so fair a mark:
Nor have I m^st my aim, nor worse have sped,
When I shot off the Duke of Norfolks head.
Now when the Duke of Somerset was dead,
My Father to the French did Bulloigne sell,
As ple^s^d him the King he governed,
And from the privy counsel did depell
Th'earles of Southampton, and of Arundell:
Thus whilst he ruled and controuled all.
The wise young King extremely sick did fall.
Who having languisht long, of l^fe deprived,
Not without poison as it was suspected;
The counsel through my Fathers means con^rived
That Suffolks Daugther should be Queen elected,
The Sisters of King Edward were rejected:
My brother Gui^for^ to Jane Gray was wedded,
Too high preferred that was so soon beheaded.
This L^dy Jane that once was termed Queeen,
Great^r in fame then fortune, was put down,
Had not King Henry's D^ughters living been,
Might for her virtues have deserved a ^rowne;
Fortune at once on her did smile and frown:
Her wedding garment for a Princes meet
Was quickly changed for a winding sheet.
For I was iump of Jul^^us ^^sars mind
That could (...) one sup^rio^ Lord endure,
Nay I to guide my S^veraigne was inclined,
And bring the common people to my lure,
Accounting that my fortune was obscure,
And that I lived in a woeful plight
If any one eclipst my glorious light.
The love to reign makes many men respect
Neither their friend, their kind^ed, nor their vow,
The love to reign makes many men neglect
The duty which to God and man they ow,
From out this fountain many mischeifes flow:
H^reof examples many may be read
In Chronicles of the English Princes dead.
This humor made King H^r^old break his oath
Made unto William Duke of Normandy:
This made King Rufus and young Beaucla^k both
Their elder Brother Robert to defy,
And Stephen to forget his loialty
To Mawa the Empress, and to hold in scorn
The faithful oath which he to her had sworn.
This made young Henry crowned by his sire,
Against his Father Warfare to maintain:
This made King John the kingdom to aspire,
Which to his Nephew Arthur did pertain,
And him in p^ison hardly to retain:
And this made Bu^ingbrook t'usurp the Crown,
Putting his lawful Sovereign Richard down.
This made Edward the fourth at his return
From Burgundy, when he to York was come,
To break the oath which he had lately sworn,
And rule the Realm in good King Henry's room;
This made the Tyrant Richard eke to doom
His Nephews death, and rid away his wife,
And so in blood to end his wretched life.
A pretty plot in practi^e I did put,
Either to take a Queen without delay,
Or when the car^s were shuffled and well ^ut,
To choose the King and cast the knaves away;
He should be cunning that great game would play;
Ill luck has he that no good game can make,
When Princes play and crowns lie at the stake.
First I assayed Queen Elizabeth to wed,
Whom diverse Princes courted, but in vain;
When in this course unluckily I sped,
I sought the Scots Queens marriage to obtain;
But when I reapt no profit for my pain,
I sought to match Denbigh my tender child
To Dame Arbella, but I was beguiled.
Even as Octavius with Mark Anthony,
And Lepidus the Roman Empire shared,
That of the world then held the sovereignty,
So I a new Triumverat prepared,
If death a while young Denbighs life had spared,
The grandame, uncle and the father in law,
Might thus have brought all England under awe.
In the low Countries did my fame soar high,
When I was sent Lieutenant general,
The Queens proud foes I stoutly did deny,
And made them to some composition fall,
There I maintained port majesticall;
In pomp and triumph many days I spent,
From noble then my name grew excellent,
Then was my heart in height of his desire,
My mind puffed up with su^quedry and pride:
The vulgar sort my glory did admire,
Even as the Romans Ave Caesar cried,
When the Emperor to the Senate house did ride;
So did the Flemings with due reverence,
Like thunder say, God save your Excellence.
Few Subjects before me obtained this style,
Unless they were as Viceroyes of this land:
The name of Lordship seemed too base and vile,
To me that governed such a royal band,
And had a Princes absolute command:
Who did not of my puissance stand in awe,
That might put him to death by martial law?
Lo, what a title has my honor got,
And Excellency added to my name?
Can this injurious world so quickly blot
A name so great out of records of fame,
Covering my glory with a vale of shame?
Or will it now contemn me being dead,
Whom living even with fear it honored?
The town of Densborough I did besiege,
Which did on composition ^hortly yield:
I did good serv^^e to my gracious liege,
Till by ill councillors I was beguiled:
For such as were my Captains in the field,
To whom at length chief charge I did commit,
Seduced me to many things unfit.
When Sir John N^rris counsel I refused,
Whose perfect skill in feats of arms I knew,
By Rowland Yorkes device I was abused,
Whereon some loss soon after did ensue;
Deventer town and Zutphen sconce I rue,
By York and Stanley without many blows,
Were tendered to the mercy of the foes.
And that which to my heart might more grief strike,
Happened the death of that renowned Knight,
My Nephew Sidney, near Coleston dike
Received his deadly wound through fortunes spite,
I sent no fr^sh supply to him in fi^ht;
I was not far often with a mighty host:
So with his loss of life some fam^ I lost.
The Court in him lost a brave Courtier;
The Country lost a guide, their faults to mend;
The Camp did loose an expert Soldier;
The City lost an honorable friend:
The Schools a patron, their right to defend:
The Court, the Country, the Schools and City,
For Sidneys death still sing a mournful dity.
Now while my princely glory did abound,
Like rich Lucullus I great feasts did make,
And was for hospitality renowned:
The use of arms I quickly did forsake;
An easier task I meant to undertake:
I took no joys in wounds and broken pates,
But to carouse and banquet with the States.
Not Heliogabalus, whose dainty fare,
Did all the Roman Emperors feast exceed
In cost and rareness, might with mine compare,
Though he on brains of Ostriches did feed
And Phenicopteines, and that instead
Of oil he used his lamps with b^lme to fill:
Such was the pleasure of this tyrants will.
To me Count Egmounts daughter did resort,
Of such brave Dames as Flanders still did yield;
That it did rather seem I came to court
A gallant Lady, then to pitch a field;
For I did lay aside the sword and shield:
At cards and dice I spent the vacant days,
And made great feasts, instead of martial fraies
But whilst in games and love my time I spent,
Seeming secure, as though I cared for naught:
My messengers abroad I daily sent,
As instruments of my st^ll working thought,
Whereby my purpose often to p^sse I brought,
And compass what before I did devise,
At such a time as no man will surm^se.
Thus great attempts I often did enterprise,
Like a Magician that with some fine wile
Dazles the sight of the spectators eyes,
And with illusions does their sense beguile,
Such policies my cunning did compile,
That I before m^ns eyes did cast a mist,
While I performed such matters as I list.
Ye that like apes do imitate my deeds,
Hoping thereby like favor to obtain;
Know that so high a spirit never breeds
In a blunt peasant, or unnurtured sw^ine,
But in my heart imperious thoughts did reign:
No fle^matick dull milk-sop can aspire,
But one compact of th'element of si^e.
He daily must devise some stratag^m,
He must be rich, stout, liberal, and wise,
The humors of base men he must contemn,
He must be gracious in the peopl^s eyes,
He should be furnished with rare qualities,
With learning, judgment, policy and wit,
And such like parts as for the time are fit.
For every forward fellow is not borne
To be a Scipio or a Maximus,
Unless that wisdom does his state adorn,
Or valor make his life more glorious,
Though he be base of birth like Marius,
Yet he by virtues aid aloft may come,
Like him that was seven times Consul in Rom^.
Ventidius name at first was mean and base,
Till he the Par^hians host had overthrown,
And Ci^ero came not of noble race,
Borne at A^pinia a poor count^y town,
Yet he mad^ arms give place unto the gown.
And Rome by his great wisdom freed from spoil.
Called him the father of their native so^le.
Perhaps young Courtiers l^arne something to sing,
To sk^p or dance before their Mistress face,
To touch like O^pheus some enchanting string,
To run at ^ilt, to jet with stately pace,
Or by some fine discourse to purchase grace,
But cannot manage the affairs of State,
Which best belongs to each great Potentate.
Listen to me ye lusty Soldiers,
That in such favor high attempt to grow,
Experience bred in me this manly years,
Has taught me cunning which you do not know,
Some precepts here I do intend to show:
And if my Siren song please not great Peers,
Then may they with Ulysses stop the^r ears.
Trust not a friend that is new reconciled,
In loves fair show he may hide foul deceit,
By him ye unawares may ^e begu^l'd,
Reveal to none your matters of great weight,
If any chance to know your lewd conceit,
Suspected to bewray your bad intent,
He ought to suffer death and banishment.
Caligula the scourge of f^mous Rome,
Wish^ all the Romans had only one head,
That when he list to give their fatal doom,
He might with one great blow str^ke all them dead,
So should he never need their h^te to dread:
Even such a mischief I w^sht to my foes,
That many men might p^rish with f^w blows.
But unto those that do your favor seek,
And by your help hope their low states to raise,
You must be cour^eous, bountiful, and meek:
Caesar by clemency won greatest praise.
And was esteemed the mirror of h^s d^yes.
For it belongs to men of great estate,
To spare the poor, and rich men's minds abate.
It Is ill to be a rub upon that ground
Whereas the Prince the alley means to sweep,
Their own conceits they fondly do confound,
That into high attempts do boldly creep,
And with their shallow pares ^oe wade to deep,
To hinder what their Sovereign does intend,
Or to control what they cannot ^mend.
Calisthenes much torment did sustain,
Because great Alexanders pride he checked,
Grave Seneca choosing his death was sl^ine
By Nero's doom, whos^ faults he did correct:
Use not too sh^rpe rebuke^, but have respect
Unto the persons, when great men do evil,
The vengeance leave to God, or to the devil.
Be not too haughty, pride ^rocureth hate,
And mean men's hate may turn to your disgrace,
Nor too familiar be in high estate,
For that will breed contempt among the base,
Observe a mean which wins man much grace:
Speak well to all, trust none, use well your foes,
For this may purchase love where hatred grows.
And if that you do fe^re your fri^nd should chance
To mount too highly in the Princes grace,
Hi^ praise to heaven then stick not to advance,
Say that the charge he bears is too base,
And that his worth deserves far better place,
So may you by this praise rid him away,
And so supply his place another day.
S^y he will prove a terror in the field,
This private life does much obscure his fame,
More fit to bear great Ajax sevenfold shield,
Then like Sardanapalus court a dame,
He idly lives at home, it is a sh^me.
His very presence may his foes appall,
Let him be sent Lieutenant General.
Now if he chance to perish in some fight,
I^ was not your work, but the chance of wars,
Or thus you may excuse your selves by fleight,
B^^ming ^he influence of the angry stars,
Th^^ thus by death his future fortune bars,
A^^ (sighing) we are sorry, you may say,
That this brave man would cast himself away.
But if in feats of arms he have no skill,
If he be learned* wise, and eloquent,
By praising him thus may you have your will,
Procure him in embassage to be sent
Far off, lest he return incontinent,
As to the mighty Ch^m, or Prestor John,
And triumph in his room when he is gone.
Let no man think I exerci^'d the ghost
Of this great Peer that sleeps in the dust,
Or conjured up his spirit to this co^st,
To press him with despair, or praise unjust:
I am not partial, but g^ve him his due,
And to his soul I wish eternal health:
Ne do I think all written tales are true,
That are inserted in his Commonwealth:
What others wrote before, I do survive,
But am not like to those incenst with hate,
And as I plainly write, so do I strive
To write the truth, not wronging his estate:
Of whom it may be said, and censured well,
He both in vice and virtue did excel.
Iamque opus exegi,
Deus dedit his quoque finem

FINIS.
