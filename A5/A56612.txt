A Brief Exposition OF THE Ten Commandments AND THE Lords Prayer.

By Simon Patrick Rector of St. Paul Covent Garden.

LONDON, Printed by J. Hayes for S. Thomson, at the Sign of the Bishops Head in
St. Paul's Churchyard. 1665.

TO MY Welbeloved FRIENDS THE PARISHIONERS OF St. Paul Covent Garden.
THere being a solemn Vow upon you, made in Baptism, to keep Gods holy will
and Commandments; it is as necessary to understand them, as it is to be honest
men, and not to falsify or break your word. For an help therefore to the
meanest capacities in a business of such importance, I have drawn up an
exposition of the Ten Commandments in this plain and familiar way of Questions
and Answers: not knowing what other course to take that would be of such
general use. For the Ignorant can reap little benefit by that which is
purposely contrived to the pitch of the wise; but there is no man of such
understanding that may not serve himself very much of that which is writ to the
simple people. And to say the truth, the plainer and more common any notion is,
of the greater weight and moment we shall find it, and the more every man is
concerned in it. Let me entreat you then not to despise this little Paper, but
to read it deliberately, and ponder every sentence in it: For it being so brief
(that the memory may not be burdened) there is not a word superfluous, which is
not necessary to the unfolding the sense of the command Search the Scriptures
also whereby every thing is proved, and afterward search and examine your
selves about the breach of any of these Precepts, either in whole or in part.
And if the Judgments of God that lie now so heavy upon us, have begot any
purposes of amendment, do not add this new aggravation of your guilt, to break
those fresh Vows whereby you have bound your selves to God. And for the
strengthening of them, Give your selves to Prayer, as the Psalmists phrase is Ps
109.4. Considering also seriously (as an help to that) what it is you ask of
God in that form of Prayer which our Lord made, of which I have also added a
short Explication. And remember withal, that all the Prayers you make will not
profit you, unless they cause you to keep Gods commands better, which is the
end likewise of all you believe. Read over that which we call the Apostles
Creed, and you will find that every branch of it does naturally bring forth an
holy life. When you confess God to be the Creator of the World; it plainly
implies his Supreme Authority over you, and the obedience you owe him upon that
account. When you acknowledg^ Jesus to be his Son and your Lord, it lays a
necessary engagement on you to be governed by those Laws which the Father
Almighty has sent him to give us. For he died and rose again to confirm and
seal them. He ascended to heaven to take upon him the government of the whole
World. And he will come again to Judge both the quick and dead according to
their works. And therefore what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy
conversation and godliness, that you may be found in peace at his appearing?
But it is not my business now to expound the Creed; whose words are better
understood* then it is design; which is (I say) to lead us to the obedience of
Gods holy will in all things. That is it which I would gladly promote. And I
earnestly beseech you that this small labor may have no small effect, but be
so successful as to excite in you such a working Faith as will save your souls.

God Almighty take you into his protection, and revoke the Orders he has given
to the destroying Angel; that you may not die, but live, to declare the works
of the Lord, and to pay your Vows to the most High. Amen.

Sept. 13. 1665.
Exodus 20. GOD spoke all these words, saying, I am the LORD thy God, which
have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

1. Thou shall have no other Gods before me.

2. Thou shall not make unto thee any graven Image, nor any likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in
the water under the earth. Thou shall not how down thy self to them, nor serve
them: For I the LORD thy GOD am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that
^ate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
Commandments.

III. Thou shall not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain: For the LORD
will not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

IV. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: Six days shall thou labor, and
do all thy work^ but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God, in it
thou shall not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
within thy gates: for in six days the LORD, made heaven and earth, the sea and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the
sabbath day, and hallowed it.

V. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land
which the LORD thy God gives thee.

VI. Thou shall not kill.

VII. Thou shall not commit adultery.

VIII. Thou shall not steal.

IX. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

X. Thou shall not cover thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his
ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbors.

The Lords Prayer.
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy
will be done on earth as it is in heaven, Give us this day our daily bread, And
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us, And
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the
Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, and ever, Amen.

A Brief EXPOSITION OF THE Ten Commandments AND THE Lords Prayer.
Question.

WHat does the Preface to the Commandments teach you?

Answer. Lev. 11.44, 45. Lev. 19.1, 2, 3. Lev. 20.7, 8. Deu. 10.12, 13.
The right that God has to Command, and the reason that I have to obey, both
as he is my Creator and Benefactor.

Q. Unto what Duties does the first Commandment engage you?

A. To acknowledge the one God of Israel to be the only true God, so as to
honor Mal. 1.6.
worship Psalm. 95.6, 7. Psalm. 96.6, 7, 9.
, fear Lev. 19.14.
, love Mat. 22.37.
, and believe him 1 Chr. 20.20.
, to trust Psalm. 62.7, 8.
, and hope Psalm. 130.7.
in him, to offer the sacrifices of Prayer and Praise to him Ps. 50.14, 15.
Psalm. no. 1, 2, 3.
, and perform all other duties Deuteronomy. 10.12, 20, 21.
, which a creature owes to his all-seeing Creator Heb. 4.13.
, and to him only Matthew. 4.10.
.

Q. What Duties do you think are required of you by the second Commandment?

A. That I give all that external worship Psalm. 95.6. 1 Cor. 6.20.
to the invisible God which he has prescribed, but by no means make any
corporeal Deuteronomy. 4.12.15, 16, 17, 18, 23. Isa. 40.18, etc.
image of him, nor give such religious worship to the image of any thing
whatsoever it Psalm. 97.7.
be.

Q Can you discern any reason whereby God does enforce this Command?

A. Yes, I observe first that he was jealous of his own people, that the very
having of an Image would estrange them from him. And secondly, That such
worshippers of other things he accounts Haters of him, and will punish them
even in their Posterity, to the Third and Fourth Generation. And thirdly, that
he will multiply mercies. To many Ages upon those who only serve him, as the
persons who truly Love and obey him.

Q. What are the Duties to which by the third Commandment you take your self to
be obliged?

A. First, Not voluntarily upon any occasion Mat. 5.34, 35, etc. Jam. 5.12.
, or for any purpose to swear at all; and secondly, when upon weighty causes I
am legally required, never to swear falsely Mat. 5.33. Eccles. 5 4, 5.
, nor promise that which I mean not to perform; and thirdly not to use the name
of God but with great Lev. 19.12.
reverence.

Q. Are the sins against this Commandment more dangerous than others?

A. Yes, Zach. 5.3, 4. Jam. 5.12
Gods plagues shall certainly light upon such sinners. For he says expressly He
will not hold them guiltless.

Q. What do you think the fourth Commandment teaches you?

A. First To set apart from my lawful, worldly employments and recreations, one
day in seven for the solemn worship of God Luk 4.16. Act. 13 14, 27. Act. 17.2.
; That I may advance my Psalm. 92.1, 2.12, 13, 14.
soul in Piety, and learn to cease all my life from sin Heb. 4.10.
, thereby preparing my self for the eternal praising of God and my Redeemer, in
the Rest which remains for his people Heb. 4.9.
and secondly, to endeavor to bring those who are under my charge to the same
observation.

Q. But why do you observe the first day of the week, when the Commandment
speaks of the seventh?

A. In memory of Christ's rising from the dead on the first day, that he might
enter into his glorious rest, having here finished his work of redemption; Act.
20 7. 1 Cor. 16.2. Rev. 1* 10
for which I have the example of the holy Apostles, and the Church of God.

Q What do you here take notice of, that enforces your allowing Gods worship
such a portion of your time?

A. I see that he has allowed me six times as much for my worldly business;
and that he himself has by his proceeding in the Creation, signified so much
to me, and thereupon allowed one day, after six days labor, to be a day of
blessings unto me.

Q. What do you think you are bound to practice by the fifth Commandment?

A. First, To reverence, Heb. 12.9.
, love 1 Timothy 5.4.
and obey Luke 2.51. Col. 3.20. Ephesians. 6.1, 2.
in all things (not disagreeing with Gods Commands Luke 14.26.
) my natural Parents. Secondly, to respect the Aged Lev. 19.32.
. Thirdly, To be ruled with humility by the Governors of the family Ephesians 6.5,
etc. Tit. 2.9, 10.
, Kingdom Romans 13.1, 5, 7. 1 Pet. 2.17.
, or Church where I live Luke 10.16.
.

Q What blessings attend upon such obedient persons?

A. Commonly a long and prosperous life, Ephesians. 6.2, 3. Romans 13, 3. 1 Pet. 2.14.
Psalm. 34 12, 13, 14.

Q What duties do you charge your self withal from the sixth Commandment?

A. Not to take away my own life Act 16 27, 28.
, nor any other man's Genesis 9.6.
(unless public Justice Psalm 101.8. Romans 13.4.
, and necessary defense of my own life Exodus 22.2 Deuteronomy. 22.26.
make it unavoidable) nor willingly to go to war, unless when I am lawfully
commanded, for preservation of the peace. Jam 4.1, 2.

Q Are these all?

A. No, I take my self necessarily engaged, First, to suppress all causeless,
and immoderate, long continued (though not causeless) anger Mat. 5.21, 22.
Secondly, to put away all contumelious, railing, and contentious language Ibid
and Ephesians. 4.31.
. Thirdly, To root out all hatred, and to love even my enemies, and to do them
good 1 John 3.15 Luke 10.29. etc. Mat. 5.44.

Fifthly, Not to oppress and gripe any man, but to relieve the poor Isa. 1.15,
16, 17. Prove. 14.21.
.

Q Do you take your self to be restrained by the seventh Commandment from more
than that which we call adultery?

A, Yes, I think all other acts Heb. 13.4. 1 Cor. 6.9, 10.
and lusts 1 These. 4.4, 5, 7. Prove. 6.25.
of uncleanness, and whatsoever may be the cause or beginning of them Romans 13
13. Ephesians. 5.3, 4, 5 Col. 3.8. Ezekiel. 16.49, 50.
, are thereby prohibited; And that I may not so much as gaze upon a woman's
beauty to satisfy my lust, without being guilty of hidden Adultery Mat. 5.38.
Mat. 5.32.
.

Q Is there any thing else that you can here observe also to be forbidden?

A. Yes, the putting away of a man's wife (except for adultery) and marrying
another, or the marrying her that is so put away.

Q. What charge does the eighth Commandment give you?

A. First, Not to take away or detain Jam. 5.4. Deuteronomy. 24.15. Pro 3.27, 28. 1 Timothy 5.18.
my Neighbors goods, either by force or fraud Prove. 11.1. Lev. 19.13, 35 Deuteronomy.
25 14.
. Secondly, not to withhold relief from those that need it 1 John 3.17. Prove
14.21. Lev 19.9, 10, 11. Deuteronomy 24.19.
.

Q. Is there any one precept which you think will secure all the duties of this
Commandment?

A. Yes, that of our Saviors. As you would that men should do to you, do to
them likewise, Luk 6.31. Matthew. 7.12.

Q What do you apprehend to be the things forbidden in the ninth Commandment?

A. Chiefly the giving any false Testimony before a Judge against any man Exodus
23.1. Deu. 19.18, 19
. And also lying, and false accusation Ephesians. 4.25. 1 Pet 2.12. Luke 3.14.
. Whatsoever likewise may defame my brother, or detract from him before men
Psalm. 15.3. Ro^. 1.29, 30.
; and all rash judgment, and censures of him in my own breast Luk 6.37. Romans
14.4. 1 Cor 13.5, 7.
.

Q. What Obligations do you think the tenth Commandment lays upon you?

A. Not to desire to my self the possessions of my Neighbor, nor to envy them
to him; but to be content in whatsoever state I am, without carefulness for the
future, Phil. 4.6, 11. Mat. 6. ult. Heb. 13.5.

Q Have you never observed any place of scripture that briefly comprehends the
sum of all these Commandments?

A. Yes, Christ tells me of two Commandments upon which the whole Law and
Prophets hang; which are mentioned (besides other places) in Mat. 22.37, etc.
Mar. 12.30, etc. Romans 13*8, 9, 10.

Q. What is the meaning of those words which secure all your duty to God, viz.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all
thy mind, and all thy strength?

A. That I esteem and desire him above all things, and bestow upon him my whole
self.

Q. What mean you by these words which give your neighbor security from you?
viz. Love thy Neighbor as thy self?

A. That I deal with every man so justly as I would he should deal with me, and
so mercifully as I wish to be dealt withal by God.

Q. Can thou do all these things of thy self without Gods special grace?

A. No, without me, says Christ, ye can do nothing.

Q. How do you think to obtain his grace?

A. One way is by frequent prayer of faith.

Q. What is frequent prayer?

A. That which bears some proportion to my minutely needs, to the greatness of
the blessings which I ask, and to the favor of being invited to be much in the
presence of God, by praying without ceasing. 1 These. 5.17.

Q. When do you pray in faith?

A. When I pray with an humble confidence that God will give what I ask, Jam.
1.5, 6, 7 Heb. 5.7.
and with an obedient readiness to do that my self which I desire he would do
for me.

Q. Has Christ left any direction for your prayers?

A. Yes, he has taught me when I pray to say, Luke 11.2, etc. Mat. 6.9, etc
Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name, etc.

Q. To whom do you direct your Prayer?

A. To our Father who is in heaven.

Q. What do you mean by that appellation?

A. I express by it my reverence Mal. 1.6. Eccl. 5.2.
to him, and my faith in him, that his goodness Mat. 7.11.
will, and his power Psalm. 115.
can, grant my request for my self and others.

Q. What are those requests which you have such an humble confidence that he
will grant?

A. They are six. In the three first, I more immediately respect his glory, in
the three last my own good.

Q. What do you desire in the first Petition, when you say, Hallowed be thy
Name?

A. That God may be known to be what he is Romans 11.36.
and accordingly esteemed Psalm 89.6.
, worshipped Psa 97.7, 9.
and praised Psa. 113.
, in word Psa. 63.4, 5
, and deed 1 Cor. 10.31. Mat. 5.16. 2 Th. 1.11, 12
, throughout the world Psalm. 86.9.
.

Q. What is it that you pray for in the second, saying, Thy Kingdom come?

A. That Christ may so rule in mine own, and all men's hearts by his holy Laws
and spirit Mat. 24.14. Romans 6.12, 14.
, that his Kingdom in this world attaining its just height 1 Cor. 15.25.
, the eternal Kingdom of the Father may appear Mat. 13.43.
.

Q. What do you beg in the third, saying. Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven?

A. That he will give to me and to all men else his grace, whereby we may as
cheerfully, unanimously, and impartially execute his Commands Act. 96.
, and submit to his disposals Act 21.14.
, Cor. 15.28.
as the Angels do Ps. 103.20 Rev 22.9.
.

Q. What do you entreat of God in the fourth, saying, Give us this day our
daily bread?

A. That he would day by day Mat. 6.25, 34.
while we are in this world, grant us (in the use of honest means 2 These. 3.10,
11, 12. 1 Timothy 69. Mat. 7.9, 11. Luke 11.11, 13. Mat. 5.16. 2 Th. 1.11, 12.
) all things fitting and sufficient for the support of our bodily p, and
spiritual life q.

Q. What is it that you ask in the fifth, saying, Forgive us our trespasses, as
we? etc.

A. That he would not so charge us with our sins as to punish us Psalm. 51.1.
; we promising the like kindness and mercy to the persons who offend us Mat.
5.7.
.

Q. But Why does Christ teach us to beg this thing conditionally, rather than
any of the rest?

A. For two reasons.

Q. What is your first?

A. To learn us that forgiveness of sin (upon which all our Religion depends,
Isa. 1.16, 17. Act. 3.19.
and without which we can expect none of the other blessings) is not absolutely
granted to any.

Q. What is your second?

A. To learn us that this particular of forgiving others, is one of the most
befitting Ephesians. 4. ult.
, yet difficult conditions Mat. 18.24, etc. 35.
.

Q. What do you pray for in the sixth and last petition, saying, Lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil?

A. That God would give us grace to persevere, and go on to perfection, that we
may not fall back to our sins again Joh. 5.14. Joh. 8.11
, by the force of any temptation 2 Timothy 4.17, 18. Romans 16.20. 1 Pet. 5.8, 9.
Luke 22.31, 32.
from the world, the flesh or the Devil.

Q. Why do you so conclude all your requests, saying, For thine is the Kingdom,
the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever? Amen.

A. We do again express, First, our sense, that to God of right belongs
eternally that dominion, obedience, and honor, which we ascribed unto him 1 Timothy 6.15, 16.
; and Secondly, our confidence that he is willing, able, and in honor, engaged
to grant all these our petitions Mat. 21.22. 2 Cor. 1.20. Ephesians. 3 20* 21.
.

The Lord fulfill all thy Petitions, Ps 20.5.
FINIS.
