The North Countrey-Taylor caught in a Trap OR, A Fool and his Money soon
parted.
Being a m^rry composed ditty of a Tailor that went up to London to seek his
Fortune, but he meeting with one of the City Mobs, who made him believe she was
a maid, but two of her Companions gul'd him of thirty pound, and got all his
Clothes, and gave him a few rags in their room: and like a ^ool he went home as
he came.

To the Tune of Du-Vaul's delight, or, Love without Measure.


ALl you that delight to hear a new sonnet,
Then do bu^ draw nere and listen a while,
It is of a Tailor now I think upon it.
This jest will produce from you a smile
This ^aylor did swe^r he was weary on's life,
(...) re he would to London to get him a wife,
^^t the (...) there for ^im was to nimble
(...) did think with them for to dissemble,
cause he h^^ his pockets w^ll lined with Gold.
^^m self he did make a suit of the new fashion
(...) Ia Gentleman ^hen he did cry,
(...) I c^m again I will see every Nation,
(...) did my fortune to try,
(...) down with his shears and his yard he did fling
He walk'^ on the Road he did merrly sing,
^till that he came to London fair City
^^re did he spy many things so pretty.
^e heart was in a maze the same for to fee.
Thus up and down the streets he went (...)
With looking (...) aring was ready to fall,
At length a Lady did meet him the which did amaze him
Because that Countryman she did him call,
Where are you a walking she to him did cry,
How does all our f^iends in your Country,
Thus she look acqu^intance tho she did not know him,
And by the hand did take him and would not forgo him,
But a ^u^ they must have before they depart.
Thus h^ was led like a shop to the slaughter
With many new fancie^ she did him feed,
She told him she was a rich Merchants daughter
find of no means she did stand in need,
Which made the Tailor to think a rare prize he had (got,
Then he calls for Tobacco and Pot after Pot,
Tap^^er quoth he I prithee be quicker
And do not spare to bring us in liquor,
For I have got money for to pay for all.
The Second Part
to the same Tune,
THis Lady did hear what he had spoken
And se^ing his money so bravely to shine,
She gave him twenty kisses in sign of loves token
and drunk unto him a whole glass of wine.
This Lap or was so sochant his money did throw
About the house as if silver did grow,
He never did dream of what would come after
For she filled his heart with joy and good ^aught^r,
But at length all his mirth to sor^ow did turn.
For when the strong liquor had wort in his noddle
Cupid in his Codpi^^e began for to move
And he could not ride without ere a saddle,
Oh then he did court her, and call her his l^ve
Then strait to a bed this couple would go,
But before that his work he could fall unto
Up comes to Roysters swearing and stamping
And in their hands two swords they had bearing
What rouge is this that does lie with my wife.
The Tailor stood shaking trembling and quaking
Just like a dog that new burnt his tail,
Then by the ears one of them did take him
Which made the poor Tailor to look very pale,
Then strait he drew his swo^d to c^t out his stones
Which he might easi^y do for they had no bone^,
But the Tailor cried out oh spare them for p^tty
For I before was nere in this Cit^p
And if I was out on'^id^ nere come again.
Here take my money and if you will believe me
I did not think but she had been a ma^^;
To part with the same it will never grieve me
Although I did work hard for it at my trade.
I but quoth they this shall not serve your turn
Then the Tailor began to ring his hands and mourn
Oh for pitties sake first time excuse me
I am a poor Tailor do not base me,
Take all I have so my life you will free.
No sirrah quoth one this shall not so free you
And All for the wrong thou have done to my wi^e
A hundred pound pay me let me advise th^e,
Or I promise thee true it shall cost thee thy life
Alas quoth the Tailor in troth I cannot do it
Take what ^ any I have and my clothes to boo't
My lie quoth he will do you small pleasure
You had better be contented with a little treasure
You can have no more of a Cat b^t her skin.
So they look all his money and stripped him naked
And gave him a few old rags to put on,
So tha^ v^u^ cost him 30 pound I heard him speak
And yet for his money he had nere a good turn
And glad he was that he escaped from them so
Tho they got his money and ^^ke his clothes two,
Thus he was fooled out of all his money
He that pays so dear f^r Hare or yet Cony,
I think he had need eat the bones and all.
Therefore let all Tailors henceforth be wiser
How they go to London their fortunes to try,
It is not good to be two much a Miser
Nor yet his money in vain for to let fly,
For now he is ready to cut his own throat
And is fain to work hard all day for a groat,
And when he takes one inch he would need take twenty
Before he gets so much money it ^^s not so plenty,
Woe betide the garment the which he does make.
So'to conclude you may see how this Tailor
The which was so gallan was quickly made poor.
He might a took w^rring by wilful James Naylor,
That sp^nt nine hundred pound on a Whore.
And when that his means he had wasted away
She l^ft^h ^ in the lurch to sigh and to say,
Far well my money and farewell my treasure
For I have paid dear for a little pleasure
But i will come no more their for a trick that I know.
Printed for R. Burton at the Horse-shooe in West-Smith-field.
