THE MEMORIALLS OF MARGARET de Valoys, First Wife to HENRY the Fourth, King of
France and Navarre. Compiled in French by her own most Delicate and Royal
hand: AND Translated into English by ROBERT CODRINGTON, Master of Arts.

LONDON, Printed by R. H. 1641.

TO THE TRVE LOVER OF ALL GOOD LEARNING. The truly Honorable, Sir Anthony
Vincent Knight and Baronet, etc.
SIR,
THe works of Royal Authors are only fit to be lodged in noble hands, to
whom then more justly could I devote this service then unto YOU to whom all
learning owes for a Patron, and the world for an Example.

This is that which has invited me to this Dedication, besides an ambition
which a long time I have nourished that poynteth at no other happiness then to
study out some way to make my self known unto YOU, and if my devotion to your
service can win on your goodness to pardon my presumption the glorious
endowments of this most illustrious Lady (who in her time was one of the
greatest Princesses of Europe) shall win on your Iudgemeut to entertain this
everlasting Issue and MEMORIAL of her, in which there is no other error to be
found but that it is presented to the world and you by this rude hand

Sir, of your most humble and most devoted servant, Robert Codrington.

An Advertisement to the Reader.
WHO is to understand that the Address of this Book in the Original is
supposed to be to Monsieur de Hardslay, chief in attendance on the Duke of
Alenson, at what time he was chosen by the Lords of Flanders for their
Protector.

The Argument of the First Book.
THE Infancy and Education of this Lady; Her attendance in ordinary on the
Queen her Mother, and her removal from that place by the same Power which did
prefer her to it. The beginning of her love with her Brother the Duke of
Alenson, which was continued to his death. Her Marriage with the King of
Navarre, on which ensued the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew. The resolutions of
her Husband, and the Duke of Alenson to join with the Huguenots, wisely
descovered, and prevented. The death of King Charles her Brother. The close
Projects and Practices at Court to plant dissension betwixt the Duke of Alenson
and her Husband, and betwixt the King her Husband and her self, occasioned
partly by the malice and aspertions of Du Guast, partly by the beauty and
temptations of Madame de Sauva, and countenanced by the too eager belief of
the King of France her Brother, to blast this Ladies Honor.

THE MEMORIALLS of QUEEN MARGARET. The first Book.
I Should have extolled your work the more, if it had not praised me so much,
being unwilling to have those praises conferred on me, which might sway me more
to self conceit then reason, for so I may be thought like Themistocles to
esteem that man to speak best who does extol me most; This is a weakness
incident to women to be taken more with praises than deserts, for this I do
condemn my sex, and would not be ranked in this condition with them;
nevertheless I do account it a great glory, that so deserving a Gentleman as
your self have drawn my picture with so rich a pencill. In this pourtraict, the
ornament of the table does far surpass the excellence of the figure which
you have made your Subject; had I any part of those graces which you impute
unto me, my afflictions having wiped them away from outward observation, have
wiped withal their rememberance from my memory; In a manner that beholding my
self in your discourse, I could do willingly as sometimes the old Lady of
Rendan, who after her husbands decease having a long time forborne her looking
glass, and having afterward a sight of her self in another glass by chance,
she demanded who it was she saw there? And although my friends that see me
would persuade me to the contrary, yet I do suspect their judgments, as
having their eyes charmed with too much affection; I believe when you shall
come unto the proof, that in this you will be on my side, and will say as I
do often write out of the verses of Bellay.

Thus Rome in Rome was sought for round,
And nothing of Rome in Rome was found.
But as we take delight to read of the destruction of Troy, of the glory of
Athens, and of such mighty Cities when most they flourished, although the
signs of them are now so small, that we hardly can discern where heretofore
they stood, so you take pleasure to describe the excellence of a beauty, of
which there remains no witness, nor appearence, but only in your writings. Had
you done it to represent the contention of Nature and of Fortune, you could not
have made choice of a more remarkable Subject, they both in me having to
emulation made essay how far their powers could extend. In that of Nature, your
self being an eye witness do not need instructions; but in that of Fortune,
being unable to make description but by report, which is subject to be
delivered by persons ill informed, or ill affected, and who cannot represent
the truth either through ignorance, or through malice, I presume that you will
take pleasure to receive these MEMORIALLS from her, who has most reason to
know them best, and who having greatest interest in them, can with greatest
truth describe their Subject.

I have also been invited to it by five or six remarkable observations in your
discourse which I have found defective, as when you speak of Pau, and of my
voyage out of France; when you speak of the late Marshall of Biron, when you
speak of Again, and of the Marquis of Canillac. I will run over my own
Memorialls, to which I will not give a more glorious name, although they well
deserve the title of a History, for the truth which they nakedly contain, being
without any ornament of language, for which I have now neither the ability, nor
the leisure. This work then of one afternoon shall repair to you in a rude and
misshapen lump, like Bears new whelpt, to receive from you their beauty and
proportion. It is a Chaos from whence already you have drawn the light. It is
indeed a story well worthy to be written by a Knight of Honor, a true Gentleman
of France, born of the Illustrious family which was cherished by the Kings my
Father, and my Brothers, and Cousin and familiar friend to the noblest and most
accomplished Ladies of our time, it being my happiness to be the Induction and
the Tie, in the Society and the Union of them.

The occurrences of the precedent with those of the succeeding times do
enforce me to begin in the reign of King Charles, and in the first time that in
my remembrance there fell out any thing worthy of observation. For as the
Geographers in the description of the Earth; when they are arrived to the
utmost bound of all their knowledge, do tell us that beyond that there are
nothing but sandy Deserts, inhabitable Lands, and Seas innavig^ble; in the like
manner will I say, that beyond that first rememberance of mine, there is
nothing to be discovered, but a wild of my first Infancy, an Infancy wherein
we live, rather guided by Nature, after the manner of plants, and other
creatures, then of men persuaded and counseled by reason; and I will leave
unto those who were the governors of my nonage that superfluous enquiry, where
peradventure among those actions of my Infancy, there will be found some as
worthy to be recorded, as that of the Infancy of Themistocles, and Alexander,
the one exposing himself in the middle of a Street to a Carters horses, who
would not stay himself at his entreaties; the other despising the rewa^d of
the Olympique Race, if Kings might not contend with him for the honor or it. Of
which number may be the answer that I made the King my Father some few days
before the fatal blow that deprived France of peace, and our house of
happiness: Being then but four, or five years of age, my Father (holding me
on his knee to hear me prattle) demanded ^f me, whom I would choose for my
servant, Monseiur the Prince of Joinville, who has been since the great and
unfortunate Duke of Guise, or the Marquis of Beaupreau, the son of the Prince
of Roche-sur-yon, in whose spirit, fortune having made too great a proof of
the excellency of it, conspired with envy to become his deadly enemy, depriving
him by death in the fourteenth year of his age, of the honors and the Crowns
which were justly promised to the virtue and magnanimity that shined in him;
they were both at play with the King my Father, and with a fixed eye I did
behold them: I made answer to my Father, that I would have the Marquis;
wherefore so replied the King? for (said he) he is not so handsome, for the
Prince of Joinville was of a ruddy color and fair to look on, and the Marquis
of Beaupreau was of a brown complexion, and hair: I told him, because he was
the wiser, and because the other would never live in peace, but would be
working mischief to one or other, and one who ever would strive for
masterdome; a true presage of what we since have seen, and the resistance which
I made to persevere in my Religion at the time of the Colloquy at Poissy, when
all the Court was inclined to the new Religion by the imperious persuasions of
many Lords and Ladies of the Court, and especially of my Brother of Anjou,
since King of France, whose Infancy could not avoid an Impression of that
Religion, who with incessant importunity did call upon me to change my
Religion, casting oftentimes my Hours into the fire, and giving me instead of
them, the prayers and psalms of the Huguenots, constraining me to take them,
which as soon as I received, I gave them to Madame de Curton my governesse,
whom God in mercy to me had preserved still a Catholic, and who oftentimes
would go with me to that good man the Cardinal of Tournon, who did counsel
and encourage me to suffer all things for the maintenance of my Religion, and
gave me new Hours and Beads in the place of those which my Brother of Anjou
had burned; And some other friends of his who were ^ealous to pervert me,
observing me again to wear them, transported with choler, would offer injury
unto me, affirming that it was mere childishness and folly that made me do
so, saying it did well appear that I had no capacity, that all those who were
of any discretion, of whatsoever age or sex they were, hearing grace preached,
were retired from the abuses of the old Superstition, but I they said, was as
very a fool as my governesse. And my Brother of Anjou, adding threats to his
reproaches, would tell me, that the Queen my Mother should cause me to be
whipped; but this he spoke of himself, for the Queen my Mother knew not of the
error into which he was fallen, and as soon as she did understand it, she did
extremely check him, and his governors and causing them to re-instruct him,
she constrained them to return to the true, holy, and ancient Religion of our
Fathers, from which she never did depart: But I replied to such threatenings of
my Brother, melting into tears, as the age of seven or eight years (at which I
then was) is tender enough, that he might cause me to be beaten, and if he
pleased he might cause me to be killed, that I would rather suffer all the
torments that cruelty could invent then pull damnation on my Soul. Many more
such answers of mine and notes of resolution and of judgment might be found,
in the discovery whereof I will no longer travail, intending to begin my
Memorialls with that time when I waited in ordinary on the Queen my Mother, to
depart from her no more; For presently after the Colloquy of Poissy, that the
wars began, my Brother of Alenson and my self by reason of our tender age,
were sent unto Ambois, whither all the Ladies of that Country retired
themselves with us, there was your Aunt the Lady of Dampierre, who then
received me into her friendship, which she continued to her death, and there
was your Cousin Madame the Duchess of Raise, who in that place knew the favor
that fortune had done her, by delivering her at the battle of Dreux from her
afflicting husband Monsieur de Annebaut, a person too unworthy to possess so
perfect, and so divine a Subject. I speak here of the beginning of the
friendship of your Aunt with me, and not of your Cousin which we have preserved
so inviolate, that it continues yet, and shall do evermore. But then the age
of your Aunt had a greater complacence with my Infancy, it being the nature of
ancient people to make much of little children, and those who are of perfect
age as was then your Cousin, to be weary of them, and to hate their importunate
simplicity. I did continue there until the commencement of the great voyage,
when the Queen my mother caused me to return to Court, to depart from thence no
more, of which I will not speak at all, being then so young, that I cannot
retain the remembrance of it but in gross, the particulars being vanished from
my memory like a dream. I leave therefore the description of it to those who
being then as you in a riper age, can remember in particular the magnificent
triumphs that were made, especially at the Duke of Bars at the Christening of
my Nephew the Prince of Lorrain, at Lions at the welcome of Monsieur and Madame
de Savoy, at Bayons at the enterview of the Queen of Spain my Sister, and the
Queen my Mother, and of King Charles my Brother. There I assure my self you
will not forget to represent that stately banquet which the Queen my Mother
made in the Island, with the mask and manner of the hall, which Nature it seems
had appropriated to that effect, there being discovered in the middle of the
I Will, a great green where was a grove of high timber trees in an ovall form,
round about which my Mother had caused great Neeches to be made, and in every
Neech she had placed a round table for twelve persons, the table only of their
Majesty's with the cloth of State advanced it self at the upper end of the
hall, and was mounted on four steps of green turfes of earth. All these tables
were served by diverse troops of Shepherds diversely apparelled with cloth or
gold and Satin, according to the diverse habits of all the Provinces of
France. At the landing of the triumphant boats (in which their Majesty's
wafting from Bayons to the I Will, were always attended by the way with the
Music of man of the Sea-gods, singing and rehearsing verses round about them)
these Shepherds were on the green, troup by troup apart, on both sides of a
great Alley, cast up on purpose for their Majesty's to go to the said Hall,
every troup playing and dancing according to the fashion of their Country: The
Poitevines with their Cornets, they of Provence dancing lavalt^es with their
Cimbals, the Burgundians and Champagnians with the Bagpipes, Treble viols, and
Tabers, the Brittons dancing loftily with their fine nimble risings, and as
many turnings with it, and so accordingly of all the other Provinces. After the
service of whom, and the Banquet ended, the Musicians were discovered with a
great troop of Satyrs to enter the great luminous rock, shining with
artificial light, but sparkling more with the jewels and the beauties of the
ladies that sat above, who coming down, did dance that most curious mask,
the glory of which the Envy of Fortune not able to endure, came storming in
with so great a Tempest, that the confusion and wrack which among the boats
that night had made, brought the next morning as great a subject of laughter,
as the magnificent setting forth of the mask before had brought delight. The
like was to be seen in all the brave Entries that were made to express the
Principal Cities of this Kingdom, whose Provinces here represented they did
visit.

In the Reign of the mighty King Charles my Brother, some few years after the
return of the great voyage, the Hugenots having begun again the war, the King
and Queen my Mother, being at Paris, a Gentleman of my Brothers of Anjou (who
has been since King of France) arrived to bring tidings from him, that he had
brought the Huguenots army to such an extremity, that he hoped in few days to
force them to give him battle, before which time, he did beseech them that he
might have the honor to see them, to the end, that if Fortune envious of the
glories which in so young an age he had obtained, should in that desired
expedition, after having done good service to his King, his Religion, and the
State, conjoyne his funerals with the triumph of his victories, he might
depart this world with less sorrow, having satisfied them both in that charge
which they had done him the honor to commit unto him. If these words touched
the heart of so good a mother, who did not live, but for her children only, to
preserve whose lives and estates, she every hour abandoned her own, you are
able to judge. Incontinently she resolved to depart with the King, taking with
her a small and usual train of Ladies, as the Lady de R^is, the Lady de
Sauva, and my self. Being borne on the wings of desire, and motherly
affection, she dispatched the way betwixt Paris, and Tours, in three days,
which was not without some inconvenience, and many Accidents worthy of
laughter, occasioned by the poor Mounsieur, the Cardinal of Burbon, who never
did forsake her, although he was neither of garb, of humor, nor complexion
for so great a Presence.

Arriving at Tours, we found my Brother of Anjou, with the chief Commanders
and Captains of his Army, who were the flowers of the Princes, and the Lords
of France, in the presence of whom he made an Oration to the King, to give him
an account of all the carriage of his charge since his departure from the
Court, composed with such art and eloquence, and delivered with so much Grace,
that he caused admiration in all the standers by: The greenness of his youth
did so much the more advance and make apparent the wisdom of his words; that
seemed more suitable with a gray beard, with an old experienced Captain, than
a young Gentleman of sixteen years of Age, whose brow the Laurells of two
Conquests had already crowned, and Beauty which gives a greater grace to every
Action, did so flourish in him, as if she were in emulation with Fortune, which
of them both should render him most glorious. The joy which my Mother did
receive hereat* can no more by words be represented, then could the Grief of
the father of Ipbigenia; and in any other but her self, whose soul was ever
wedded to discretion, one might easily have perceived the exilience which such
an excess of joy had made, but she moderating her actions, as well she could,
demonstrating apparently, that the Discreet do nothing which they would not
do, without studdying to proclaim her joys, or stretch in words those
praises which the Actions of so accomplished and dear a child did merit, took
only the chief points of his oration, which concerned the actions of the
war, to deliberate on them with the Princes and the Lords there present, to
take a thorough resolution for the war, and to provide things necessary for it;
for the disposing whereof, it was requisite to continue there some certain
days; in one of which, the Queen my mother walking in the Park, with some of
the Princes, my Brother of Anjou in^reated me that we might walk aside into ^n
Alley, into which being come, he thus spoke to me.

Sister, the education which we have had together, does no less obliege us
unto love, then the neernesse of our blood, and you have understood, that among
all my brothers and sisters, I have ever had a greater inclination to wish well
to you then unto any of them, and I have well observed that your nature has
ever borne to me the same respects of love; hitherto we have been guided to it
by Nature, not by counsel, neither has this Action brought us any profit, but
only the pleasure we have to converse together, This indeed was agreeable to
our Infancy, but this hour requires that we no longer live like children, you
see the great and honorable charges to which God has called me, and to which
the Queen, our good Mother, has advanced me, you ought to believe that you
being the only thing in the world whom I do most affect and cherish, I shall
not be master of that greatness or fortune, of which you shall not be
partaker. I know you have capacity and judgment to do me good offices with the
Queen my mother, to preserve me in that Fortune wherein I stand; my principal
intention is to labor to retain her favor. I am afraid my absence will do me
wrong, and yet the war, and the charge I have, constrain me almost to be
always absent; In the mean while, the King my brother is always with her,
does please and flatter her in all things. I am afraid, at length it will prove
prejudicial to me, and that the King my brother coming to be great, and being
full of courage, will not always mind the chase, but ambitious of change,
will turn the chase of beasts into the chase of men, and taking away from me
the charge of the Kings Leivtenant, which he has given me, will lead the Army
himself. This would prove to me so great a Ruin, and a Grief, that before I
would receive so great a fall, I would embrace the most cruel death. In this
apprehension, studying the means to prevent it, I find it necessary for me to
have some faithful persons that may make good my part with the Queen my
mother, I know not any so fit for this, as you, whom I have ever held for my
second self. You have all the parts that can be desired for it, understanding,
judgment, and fidelity, wherefore if you will so much obliege me, as to render
your self observant of her, desiring you to be always at her rising, at her
closet, at her lying down, and briefly all the day, this will obliege her to
communicate her self unto you; with this will I express unto her your
ability, and what comfort and service she shall receive from you, and I will
entreat her no more to take you for a child, but to employ you in my Absence,
as my self; this I do assure my self, that she will do. Speak you to her
with the same confidence as to me, and assure your self, you shall find her
affable. This shall be to you a happiness as great as good, to be beloved of
her, and and herein you shall do much for your self and me; and for my self, I
shall next to God, acknowledge you to be the establishment of my fortunes.

This language seemed very strange to me, as having yet ever lived without
employment, and minding nothing besides hunting, and dancing, not having so
much as the curiosity of affecting new fashions, or of seeming beautiful, as
being yet not indebted to age for that Ambition, and I was trained up under the
Queen my mother, with such constraint and awe, that I durst not presume to
speak unto her only, but when she looked on me, with what speed I could, I
would steal away for fear of doing something that might displease her;
insomuch I was about to answer him, as Moses sometimes answered God out of the
Vision of the Bush, What am I, send thou him whom thou ought to send;
Notwithstanding, finding in my self (what I thought there had not been) those
faculties stirred up by the object of his words, which before lay undiscovered
to me, and being borne with spirit enough, returning to my self from my former
astonishment, those words did much affect me, and me thought, that I was at
that instant a creature transformed, and was now become a thing of more account
then heretofore I had been, insomuch, that taking confidence in my self, I
answered him; Brother, if God shall give me the capacity and boldness to
talk unto the Queen my mother, as I have the will to do you service in what
you desire of me, assure your self, you shall receive that profit and content
which you have proposed to your self, you have reason to be confident of me,
for nothing in the world does more honor and affect you then my self, procure
only that I may be with the Queen my mother, and you shall be there your self,
I being only there for you. I expressed these words with my heart rather then
my mouth, as the effects can witness: for being departed from him, the Queen
did call me to her closet, and said, Your Brother has told me the discourse
that you have had together, and now no longer takes you for a Child, no more
will I, it shall be a great comfort to me, to speak to you, as to your
Brother. Render your self diligent and dutiful, and be not afraid to speak
freely to me, for I will have it so. These words did shoot such an unbounded
joy into my soul, as before it never apprehended, and me thoughts, that all
the contents which I received till then, were but as shaddows to this bliss,
with a disdainful eye I looked back on the recreations and exercises of my
infancy, as dancing, hunting and the companions of my childehood, despising
all, as vain and foolish. I did obey this pleasing command, not failing a day to
be with the first at her rising, and with the last at her lying down, and she
did me the honor to speak unto me sometimes two or three hours together, and
God gave me the grace that she remained so satisfied therewith, that she could
not sufficiently praise me to her women, I talked to her always of my Brother,
and did advertise him of all occurrences with such fidelity, as I breathed
forth nothing but his desires.

In this happy estate I did remain some certain time with the Queen my Mother,
during which the battle of Montcontour was fought, at the news whereof my
Brother of Anjou who desired nothing more then to be with the Queen my Mother,
sent her word that he was going to besiege Saint John d' Angeli, and that the
Kings and her presence would be of much importance at the siege. She more
desirous then himself to come, resolved presently to depart, attended only
with her ordinary train, of which I was one, and I went with her extremely
joyous, not foreseeing the ensuing mischief which fortune had prepared. Too
young as I was, and unexperienced I did not suspect my happiness, and
believing the prosperity I enjoyed to be permanent, I collected to my self a
perpetuity of my fortune, but my envious stars that could not support the
continuance of so happy a condition did provide me as much affliction at my
arrival, as I promised to my self pleasure by my fidelity by which I thought
to have obliged my Brother; for in his absence from Court, he had taken to him
Le Guast, by whom he was so much possessed, that he saw not but by his eyes,
nor spoke but by his mouth; This wicked fellow born for mischief suddenly
bewitched his spirit, and filled it with a thousand tyrannical precepts, as
that he ought not love or trust to any but himself, that he must not join any
to his fortunes, no not his Brother, or his Sister, and such goodly
Matchivilian tenants, imprinting which in his understanding, and he resolving
to practice them, as soon as we were come, after the first salutations, my
Mother began to commend me, and to tell him with what faith and diligence I had
attended on her, he answered her coldly, that he was glad of it, but wisdom
he said did not permit, that she should use the same expedients at all times,
and what seemed necessary in one hour, might prove prejudicial in another.
She demanded of him, what did move him so to speak, whereupon, he seeing the
time for his invention which he had contrived for my ruin, made answer that I
was grown very beautiful, and that Monsieur de Guise intended to be a suitor
to me, being induced to it by his aspiring Uncles, and if it came to pass that
I should affect him, it were to be suspected that I would discover to them
whatsoever thing she told me; He told her, that she was not ignorant of the
ambition of that house, which had always sought to suppress and to ruin
ours, for which occasion it were requisite, that she should talk no more of
affairs unto me, but by degrees retire her self and her familiarity from me;
That very evening I found the change which that pernicious Council had wrought
in her, and seeing she feared to speak unto me before my Brother, having
commanded me three or four times as she was talking to him to go to bed, I
waited until he was gone out of the chamber, and then approaching to her I did
beseech her to tell me if through my ignorance I were so unhappy, as to have
done any thing which might displease her. At first she began to dissemble with
me, but in the end she said, daughter your brother is wise, you must not think
ill of him, for that which I shall tell you tends unto good: she repeated
then all the discourse that had past betwixt the^, and commanded me to speak no
more unto her before my brother. These words were as many needles in my heart,
as those were a joy unto me when she received me first into her favor; I
omitted nothing to represent unto her my innocence, urging that what he talked
of was a thing of which I never heard, and if any such thing should happen, it
should no sooner be spoken to me, but forthwith I would acquaint her with it;
But it advantaged nothing, my Brothers words had left such a deep impression in
her heart that there was no room for truth, or reason; Seeing this, I told her
that I was less sensible of the evil of the deprivation of my happiness,
because I found no good by the acquisition of it, that my Brother might take me
away, as he had given me, for he preferred me to her without merit, praising me
when I was unworthy, and that he now deprived me of it without any desert,
only on an imaginary subject which had no being but in his fancy, but I
besought her to believe, that I would for ever preserve the remembrance of what
my Brother had done unto me; hereat she grew into a great choler, commanding
me not to show the least appearance or sign of any thing. From that time daily
more and more she diminished her favors, making her Son her Idol, and
endeavoring to content him in this and whatsoever else he desired of her. This
affliction oppressing my heart, and possessing all the faculties of my soul,
rendered my body more apt to receive the contagion of the bad air, which was
then in the army, insomuch that I fell within few days after, to be extremely
sick of a malignant and spotted Fever, a sickness which then ran fatally up
and down, and which at the same time had born away two of the principal
Physicians of the King and Queen, Chappellain and Castelan, intending, as it
seems, by taking away the Sheepheards to make a better market of their flock,
and very few of those escaped who were infected. I being in this extremity the
Queen my Mother who knew partly the cause of it, omitted nothing that might
ease me, taking the pains without fearing the danger to come unto me every
hour, which brought me much comfort, but the dissembling of my Brother did as
much again augment my grief, who after he had showed himself so unfaithful,
and was guilty of so great ingratitude, departed neither day nor night from my
bed, attending as officiously on me, as in the time of our greatest friendship;
but I who by commandment had my mouth shut, answered not his hypocrisy but by
sighs (as Burrus sometimes did Neroe's, who died by the poison that the tyrant
gave him) sufficiently witnessing unto him, that the cause of my sickness was
the contagion of the evil offices that he had done and not of the infected
air: but God had pity on me, and delivered me from that danger, and after
fifteen days the army departing, they carried me in a Litter, where every
evening retiring to my chamber, I found King Charles who took the pains with
many other noble Gentlemen to convey my Litter to my Bed.

In this estate I came to Angeirs to Saint John de Angeli, sick of body, but
more sick of mind, where to increase my misery I found Monsieur de Guise and
his Uncles arrived, which rejoiced as much my Brother, giving some color to
his former artifice, as it gave me the apprehension to increase my pain, where
my Brother, the finer to spin his thread, came every day unto my Chamber,
bringing with him Monsieur de Guise, whom he counterfeited to love entirely.
And to give him cause to think so, he would oftentimes in embracing him say
unto him, I would to God you were my brother: To which Monsieur de Guise would
make as though he did not understand him, but I who knew his malice did loose
all patience, and could not but tax him for dissembling.

About this time there was a report of my marriage with the King of Portugal,
who sent his Ambassadors to demand me. The Queen my Mother enjoined me to
prepare my self to receive them, which I did, but my Brother persuaded her
that by no means I would be induced to that marriage, she communed with me
about it in the evening, and demanded of me how I stood affected to it,
thinking thereby to take an occasion to be angry with me; I replied to her,
that my will altogether depended upon hers, and whatsoever was pleasing unto
her should be as agreeable unto me: She answered me in choler to which before
they had raised her, that what I spoke unto her was not from my heart, and that
she knew well, that the Cardinal of Lorrain had exhorted me to entertain his
Nephew, I besought her that she would be pleased to come to the effect of the
marriage with the King of Portugal, and she should then perceive the fruits of
my obedience; Every day brought in some new tidings concerning this Subject, to
exasperate her the more, and to torment me, which were all inventions contrived
in the shop of Le Guast; In a manner that I had not one day of quiet, For on
one side the King of Spain hindered that my marriage should not be, and on
the other side, Mounsieur de Guise being at Court, served always as a pretext
to furnish new Subjects of persecution on me, although that neither he, nor any
of his kindred did ever so much as speak unto me, and it was now more then a
year, since he was a suitor to the Princess de Portia, but because that
marriage was deferred, it reflected always on this illation, that he aspired
unto mine, which I observing, resolved to write unto my Sister Madam de
Lorrayne, that could do all in that House, entreating her to be a means that
Monsieur de Guise might be withdrawn from Court, and that the marriage might be
dispatched betwixt him and the Princess de Portia his Mistress, representing
to her how this invention was complotted as much for Monsieur de Guize his
ruin, as my own; the truth of this she knew very well, and came presently
after to the Court, where she caused the said marriage to be accomplished, by
that means delivering me from detraction, and giving the Queen my mother to
understand the truth of that which I had always said. This stopped the mouth
of all mine enemies, and gave me rest.

In the mean while the King of Spain, who would have none but his own birds
fly out of his own nest, quite brake off the marriage with the King of
Portugal, and there was heard no more rumor of it. Some few days after,
there was a report of my marriage with the Prince of Navarre, who is now the
brave and magnanimous King of France, and of my self. My mother being one day
at the Table, communed there a great while with Mousieur de Meru, because they
of the House of Montmorancy were the first that made the motion. And rising
from the table, she told me that she had spoken to him to confer with me
about it. I made answer, that I having no other will but hers, it were
superfluous, but I besought her seriously to consider that I was a Catholic,
and that it would be a great affliction to me, to be married to one that was
not of my Religion. Afterward my Mother going to her closet, called me, and
told me that the Lords of Montmorancy proposed again that marriage to her, and
that she willingly would know how I stood affected. I replied to her again,
that I had neither choice nor will, but what was hers, and besought her again
to remember, that I was a true Catholic. At the end of certain days, the
report still continuing, the Queen of Navarre, mother to the said Prince came
to Court, where the marriage was fully agreed upon before her death, to whom
there happened a pretty Passage, which deserves not indeed to be recorded in
this story, but to be passed off in silence twixt you and me. Madam de Nevers,
whose humor you well know, being come with Monsieur the Cardinal of Burbon,
Madam de Guise, Madam the Princess of Conde, and her sisters, with my self, to
discharge the last duty due unto her dignity and the proximity betwixt us, we
found her not with the pomp and ceremonies of our Religion, but in the
preciser cut of affected Huguenotery. She had about her ordinary bed the
curtains open, without light, without Priests, without a Cross, and without
Holy Water. We kept our selves some five or six paces from her bed, with the
rest of the company. Madame de Nevers, whom in her life time she hated above
all the creatures in the world, and who ever had returned good unto her for it,
both in will and words, as you knew she would carry her self fairly to those
she hated, departed from our troop, and with many graceful, humble and
submissive courtesies she came near unto her bed, and taking her by the hand,
did kiss it, and again with a lowly courtesy, and most full of humble
respects, she withdrew her self unto us, we who did know their hatred thinking
that --

Some few months after, the Prince of Navarre, who then called himself King
of Navarre, mourning for the Queen his mother, came thither, accompanied with
Eight hundred Gentlemen all in blacks, and was received by the King and all the
Court with great honor, and some few days after, my Nuptials were Solemnized
with more magnificence and triumph then was ever any of my quality. The King of
Navarre and his troop had changed their blacks into habiliments most rich and
gorgeous, and all the Court accoutred, as you know, and can far better
represent it. I was royally attired with the Crown. Before me I had on a Robe
of powdered Ermines, which glistered all over with the sparkling stones that
reflected from the Crown, and behind me the great blew Mantle, the train
whereof being four else, was carried by three Princesses, the scaffolds were
set up, as it is usual at the marriages of the Daughters of France, from the
Euesche to our Ladies, and covered with cloth of Gold. The people thronged
below to see the wedding, and all the Court passed along upon the scaffolds. We
came to the door of the Church, where Monsieur the Cardinal of Bourbon,
having received us to say the words accustomed for such Solemnities, did there
the office for that day.

We being thus, Fortune who never g^ants unto mortality a perfect happiness,
changed soon after this happy estate of triumphs and of nuptials into another
clean contrary, by the hurt which the Admiral received, which so offended
those of the Religion, that it made them even desperate, insomuch that old
Pardaillan, and some other of the chief Huguenots talked so loud to the Queen
my mother, that they made her conceive they had some bad intention: By the advice of Monsieur de Guise, and my Brother the King of Polonia, who since has
been King of France, a counsel was taken to prevent them, a counsel to which
King Charles was no way accessory, who loved Monsieur de la Rochefoucault,
Teligny, la Noue and some others who were the chief of that Religion, whose
service he did account to make use of in Flanders, and I my self have heard
him since affirm, that with much difficulty and importunity he consented to
it, and unless they had made him understand that his life and state were in
the utmost jeopardy, he had never given way unto it; And having known the
assault which Mauravell had made on Monsieur the Admiral by a shot from a
Pistol, which he discharged out of a window, whereby thinking to kill him, he
was only wounded in the shoulder, the King suspecting truly, that Mauravel
made that shot, by persuasion of Monsieur de Guise, in revenge of the death of
his father the late Monsieur de Guise, whom the said Admiral had caused to be
slain in the same manner by Poltrot, he was in so great a choler against
Monsieur de Guise that he swore he would see Justice executed, and if Monsieur
de Guise had not withdrawn and hid himself all that day, the King had caused
him to be apprehended, and the Queen my Mother had never more to do then to
make King Charles understand, that it was done for the benefit of his Estate,
so great an affection he did bear to Monsieur the Admiral, la Noue and
Teligny, whose spirits and whose valor he well observed, being so noble a
Prince that he affected not any whom he saw not endued with such qualities, and
though they had been most pernicious to the state, these foxes knew so well to
dissemble, that they had won the heart of this brave Prince, who hoped to
make them profitable to him for the enlargement of his estate, whiles they
propounded to him great and glorious enterprises in Flanders, the only
attraction of that royal and mighty spirit. And although the Queen my Mother
in this accident represented to him that the assassinate, which the Admiral
made before on the Father of Monsieur de Guise did render his Son excusable in
taking vengeance himself on the Admiral, because he could not have justice
done him, as also that although the assault which the Admiral had made on
Charry master of the Camp (a person whose valor had so faithfully assisted
her during the time of her regency and his nonage) did render him worthy of
such entreaty, although that these words might make the King conceive, that the
revenge for Charryes death was deeply imprinted in my Mothers heart, yet his
Soul overcome with grief for the loss of those persons, whom he thought one
day, as I have said, would be advantageous to him, did so eclipse his
judgment that he could neither moderate nor change his passionate desire to
see justice executed, giving strict command continually to search out and
apprehend Monsieur de Guise, protesting that such an act should not escape
unpunished. In the end as Pardaillan at supper with the Queen my Mother
discovered by his threats, the badd intention of the Huguenots; and my Mother
saw that this accident had brought the affairs to such an exigence that if
they prevented not their design, that night they would attempt against the King
and her, she took a resolution thoroughly and plainly to acquaint the King with
the truth of all, and of the danger in which he was. For this business she
selected Monsieur the Marshall de Raise, from whom she knew that the King would
take it best, as being one to whom the King imputed greatest trust, and one
whom he most did favor, who came unto the King about nine or ten of the clock
in the Evening, and told him that as his most faithful servant he could not
conceal the danger wherein he was, if he persevered in that resolution to have
Justice executed on Monsieur de Guise, and that it was requisite he undestood
that the wound which the Admiral received, was not only occasioned by Monsieur
de Guise, but that my Brother the King of Polonia since King of France, and the
Queen my Mother were both abettors in it; that he knew the extreme displeasure
that my Mother received at the assassinate on Charry, as great reason she had
for it, having then but few such servants who depended only on her, France
being (as well he knew) in the time of his nonage divided, the Catholics
standing for Monsieur de Guise, and the Hugunots for the Prince of Conde, both
of them attempting to dispossess him of the Crown, which next to God was not
preserved, but by the wisdom and the vigilance of the Queen his Mother, who in
her extremity found her not more faithfully assisted by any then by the said
Charry, that also she observed that the said Admiral was ever a most dangerous
and pernicious member of the State, and whatsoever appearance he made of the
affection to his Majesty, and to serve him in his wars in Flanders, his only
design was to trouble France, that her intention indeed was only to take away
the Plague of the Kingdom the Admiral, but mischief and misfortune so did
guide it, that Mauravell missed in his shot, and that the Huguenots thereon
were grown so desperately obstinate, that not only attempting against Monsieur
de Guise, the Queen his Mother, the King of Polonia his Brother, but believing
that he himself was consenting to it, they were resolved that night to have
their recourse to Arms, insomuch that he saw his Majesty in a great and most
apparent danger, by the Catholics by reason of Monsieur de Guise, and by the
Huguenots for the reasons above mentioned. King Charles who was of great
wisdom, and who always had been most obedient to the Queen my Mother, and a
most Catholic Prince, seeing how eminent was the danger, took a sudden
resolution to join himself to the Queen his Mother, and to conform himself to
her will, and by the Catholics to secure his person from the Huguenots, but not
without extreme grief, that he could not save the lives of Teligny, la Noue,
and Monsieur de la Rochefoucault: And going presently himself to find the
Queen his Mother, he sent for Monsieur de Guise and all the other Princes, and
Catholic Captains, where resolution was taken that very night to begin the
Massacre of Saint Bartholomew: And presently putting their hands unto the work,
the chains stretched forth, and the alarm beating, every one ran into his
quarter (according to the order given) as well unto the Admiral as to the
Huguenots: Monsieur de Guise bestowed himself on the lodging of the Admiral,
into whose Chamber one Besme an Almaine Gentleman having mounted, after having
stabbed him to death, did throw him out of the window to his master Monsieur de
Guise.

For my part I heard nothing of all this, I saw all the world in action. The
Huguenots were struck into desperation by this assault, and the Lords de Guise
fearing the execution would not be hot enough, did whisper every man in the
ear to see it thoroughly performed: The Huguenots suspected me because I was a
Catholic, and the Catholics suspected me, because I was Espoused to the King
of Navarre, who was a Huguenot, so that I heard nothing of it, until that
Evening, being at the lying down of the Queen my Mother, I sat on a Coffer near
unto my Sister of Lorraine whom I saw wonderfully pensive: The Queen my Mother
conferring with some there present, perceived where I sat, and commanded me to
go to bed; As I was a making my courtesy unto her, my Sister took me by the
arm and held me by it, and bursting forth in tears, she cried out, good God!
dear Sister do not go: These words struck a great fear into me, which the Queen
my Mother did perceive, and calling my Sister to her was very angry with her,
and forbad her to tell me any thing: My Sister replied, there appeared no
reason, that my life should be thus made a Sacrifice, and that without doubt if
they discovered any thing, they would revenge themselves on me; The Queen my
Mother answered, that if it pleased God I should receive no hurt, but howsoever
it fell out, I must needs be gone, for fear my absence should give occasion of
suspecting any thing. I saw very well they were in earnest disputation, but I
did not understand their words, when again she commanded me very roundly to go
to bed. My Sister weeping, bad me good night, not daring to tell me any thing,
and I went away as a thing lost in amazements, and in fears. As soon as I came
into my closet, I betook my self to Prayer, and besought Almighty God, that
he would be pleased to take me into his protection, and to defend me, not
knowing from what, or whom: By and by the King my husband who was in bed,
desired me that I would hasten to him, which I did, and found his bed
encompassed with thirty or forty Huguenots, which till then I not observed, for
but a few days were passed, since I was married to him, they did nothing else
but talk of the Accident that befell Monsieur the Admiral, resolving as soon
as it was day to demand justice of the King on Monsieur de Guise, and if the
King would refuse to right them, they would then right themselves. All that
night my sisters tears were soaking into my heart, and I could not sleep for
the apprehension into which she had put me, not knowing whom to fear: The
night in this manner passed away without shutting of my eyes; About the break
of day, the King my husband said, that he would go play a game at Tennis,
attending till King Charles were stirring, resolving with all speed to demand
justice of him, he went out of his chamber, and all his Gentlemen with him; I
seeing it was day, believing the danger which my sister did imply was now
passed, being overcome with sleep, commanded my nurse to make fast the door,
that I might sleep without disturbance; about an hour after, I being in a
sound sleep, Behold a man knocking with his hands and feet at the door, and
crying out, Navarre, Navarre; My Nurse thinking it to be the King my husband*
ran presently to the door. It was a Gentleman named Monsieur de Teian, who
had received a cut with a sword on the elbow, and a thrust with a halberd
through the arm, and was pursued by four of the Guard, who came rushing into
my chamber with him. He endeavoring to save his life, did cast himself on my
bed, and I perceiving the man begin to take hold of me, did throw my self
toward the wall, and he flung himself after me, taking fast hold behind me. I
did not know the man, and could not tell if he came thither to violate me, or
whither those of the Guard would have him, or me, we both cried out, and were
both equally affrighted. At length it pleased God that Monsieur de Nansay,
Captain of the Guard came in, who finding me in that estate, although he was
touched with compassion, could not refrain from laughter, and very sharply
reprehended those of the Guard, for Indiscretion, and made them depart, giving
me the life of that poor Gentleman who took hold of me, whom I caused to
remain in my closet until he was well recovered; and changing my linen,
because he had covered it with blood: Monsieur de Nansay related to me all that
had passed, and assured me that the King my husband was in the chamber of the
King, and that he should receive no hurt, and causing me to throw a night-gowne
on me, he did lead me into the chamber of my Sister Madame de Lorraine,
whither I came rather dead then alive, and passing through the the Presence
chamber, whose doors were all open, a Gentleman called Borse, saving himself
from the pursuers, was struck through with a Halberd some three paces from me,
I fell down on the other side, fainting away, and thought that the same stroke
had run us both thorough; And being a little recovered to my strength, I
entered into the chamber where my Sister lay, I was no sooner there, but
Monsieur de Miossans, chief Gentleman to the King my husband, and Armagnack,
chief groom of his chamber, came and besought me to beg their lives. I
presently made haste, and fell on my knees before the King and the Queen my
Mother, beseeching them to grant me this suite, to which in the end they
condiscended.

Some five or six days after, they who had begun this game, knowing that they
had failed in their principal design, not aiming so much at the Huguenots, as
at the Princes of the Blood, did impatiently endure that the King my husband,
and the Prince of Conde were yet alive, and knowing that no man durst attempt
against the King of Navarre, because he was my Husband, they began to weave
another web, persuading the Queen my mother, that it was necessary to dissolve
the Marriage. In this resolution, being one morning at the rising of the Queen
my mother, on a day in which we were to receive the Sacrament, she took on oath
of me to tell her the truth, and demanded of me if my Husband were a man or no,
telling me, if he was not, that she had then means to disanul the marriage. I
besought her to believe, that I understood not what her demand was, for I might
well have answered as the Roman Lady, whose husband being angry with her that
she never told him of his evil breath, she made answer, that she thought that
every man's breath did smell as his. But I told her howsoever it was, since she
had placed me with him, it was my resolution there to stay, perceiving very
well that this separation which she spoke of, was only to procure a mischief
to the King my husband.

After this, we accompanied the King of Polonia as far as Beaumont, who some
months before his departure from France, having labored by all means to make
me forget the cvill offices of his Ingratitude, and to reduce our friendship to
the same perfection as it was in our younger years, obliged himself in a
thousand oaths and promises at his farewell to me. His departure out of
France, and the Kings sickness, which began almost at the same time, did rouse
the spirits of the two parties of this kingdom, making diverse projects on the
State, the Huguenots having at the death of the Admiral, by sealed writings
obliged the King my husband, and my Brother of Alenson to revenge his death
(gaining my brothers heart a little before the feast of Saint Bartholomew, with
the hope to establish him in Flanders) persuaded them as the King and Queen my
mother came back to France, to steal away into Campaign, where certain
troops should be ready to attend them. Monsieur de Miossans, a Catholic
Gentleman, having heard of this design so pernicious to the King his Master,
advertised me of it, to prevent the bad effects which might prove so
prejudicial to themselves, and to the State. I made haste immediately to the
King, and the Queen my Mother, telling them that I had a certain thing to
communicate unto them, which did much concern them, and which I never would
discover, unless they would assure me, that it should not prove hurtful to
whom I named, and also provide a remedy without making show of knowing any
thing. I told them then, that the next morning, my Brother and the King my
husband intended to join with some troops of Huguenots which came to seek
them by reason of the oath and obligation for revenge, which the Huguenots had
made at the Admiralls death, which obligation, being for their fathers
slaughter, was now excusable by their children. I besought them to pardon my
brother, and the King my Husband, and to hinder their departure without out
making it apparent wherefore it was done; this they accorded to, and it was
carried with so much wisdom and dexterity, that without the knowledge of the
cause, they had not the means to escape. This being passed, we arrived at Saint
Germans, where we stayed a long time by reason of the Kings sickness, during
which time, my Brother of Alenson labored by all suits and services to render
himself so agreeable unto me, that in the end I vowed him friendship, as I had
done before unto King Charles, for till that time, because he had always his
education out of Court, we had scarce the knowledge of each other, and
therefore could not be familiar; In the end perceiving my self invited by such
obsequiousness, by so many observances, and protestations which he daily did
express, I did resolve to embrace his love, and to be mindful of all good
offices that might concern him, nevertheless with this caution, that it
should be without prejudice to the duty which I owed to King Charles my
Brother, whom I honored above all things in the world; he continued this his
affection to me, having witnessed it with perseverance to his end.

During this time the sickness of King Charles daily increasing the Huguenots
never ceased to raise new troubles by raising new projects, and indeavored
again to retire my Brother the Duke of Alenson and the King my Husband from the
Court, which came not to my knowledge as at the former time, nevertheless it
pleased God the mischief should be disclosed to the Queen my Mother so near to
be put in practice, that the troops of the Huguenots were to arrive that day
near unto Saint Germans, in so much that we were constrained to remove from
thence at two a Clock after midnight, and to put King Charles into one Litter
to recover Paris, the Queen my Mother disposing of my Brother and the King my
Husband in her own Chariot, who were not now so gently handled as before; For
the King did go to Bois de Vencennes, from whence it was not permitted him to
depart again: And time continuing the sharpness of his Evil produced daily
new occasions to increase his discontents, and the distrust he conceived of
them, to which the combination and the plots of those who always desired the
ruin of our House did, as I believe, lend too much help. These distrusts were
carried with so much violence, that the Lords Marshals also de Montmorancy and
de Cosse, were retained prisoners at Bois de Vencennes, and la Mole and the
Count of Cocanas were put to death; nay to such an extremity and height of
perfect danger the affairs were brought, that the Commissaries of the Court of
Parliament were deputed to hear my Brother and the King my Husband, who were
both restrained of their liberty. The King my Husband having none to Counsel
him, commanded me to draw in writing that which he had to answer, to the end
that he might not trouble himself nor any other. God gave me the grace to draw
it so to purpose, that he remained well satisfied, and the Commissaries were
amazed to see him so well prepared; And seeing by the Death of la Mole and the
Count of Cocanas they found themselves so charged that they were in danger of
their lives, I resolved, although I was in such favor with King Charles that
he loved nothing more then me, to venture my own fortunes for the preservation
of their lives, having deliberated and determined with my self, seeing that
not any of the Guard looked in, nor caused my women to unmask as daily I went
into my Coach and lighted from it, to disguise one of them into a woman, and to
take him with me into my Coach: And although they were well cleared of the
Guard, and that the enlargement of the one was sufficient to assure the life of
the other, yet they could never agree which of them should; come forth, either
of them desiring to be that person, and neither of them being willing to stay
behind, so that this design could not be put in execution, but God did
provide a remedy by a means too grievous to me, for he deprived me of King
Charles who was all the comfort and supportance of my life, a Brother from whom
I never received but good, and who in all the persecutions which my Brother of
Anjou brough upon me had always assisted, advised, and directed me: briefly, I
lost in him what ever I could loose.

After this disaster fatal to France and me, we went to Lions to meet the King
of Polonia, who still possessed by le Guast, rendered of the same causes the
same effects and believing the advice of that pernicious Spirit which he had
left in France to maintain and make good his part, he conceived an extreme
jealousy against my Brother of Alenson, suspecting and impatiently bearing the
Union betwixt my Husband the king and him, and believing that I was the only
chain that united and preserved their love, and therefore contrived as his
aptest and most expedient course, on the one side to traduce and set me at
distance with the King my Husband, and on the other to procure that the Lady de
Sauva to whom they both were servants should handle them in such a manner, that
the one might grow extremely jealous of the other. This abominable plot the
fountain and beginning of so many Crosses and Afflictions which my Brother and
I have since endured, was pursued with as much heat and subtilty, as it was
with wickedness contrived. Some are of opinion that God has an extraordinary
and particular protection of Illustrious personages, and into those spirits
where the raises of his excellence do more brightly shine, he gives them by
their good Angels some secret advertisements of the accidents which are
prepared for them, be they good or evil; In which number I may justly place
the Queen my Mother, who has proved many examples of it. The very night before
that inauspicious turnament, she dreamed that she saw the King my Father
wounded in the eye, as the next day he was, and being awaked, she often times
besought him that he would not tilt that day, but content himself with the
pleasure of seeing the Tournaments without being an Actor in them; inevitable
destiny permitted not so great a blessing to this kingdom that he should
receive such saving Counsel: neither did she ever loose any of her Children,
but a little before she saw the apparition of a great flame, whereat she
suddenly would cry out God bless my Children! and immediately after she
understood the sad news which by that fire was presaged. In her sickness at
Metz, being in great extremity by a pestilent fever, which she took by going
to see the Religious Houses of women; whereof there were many in that City,
which a little before had contagiously been infected, from which desperate
malady, miraculously she was recovered, God then restoring her to this state
which had so much need of her, by the diligence of Monsieur de Castelan her
Physician, who like a new Aesculapius made an admirable proof of the
excellence of his art: She raving, and attended by King Charles my Brother, and
my Sister and Brother of Lorraine, with many Lords of the Counsel, and many
Ladies and Princesses who were round about her bed, and although conceiving her
past recovery, would not abandon her, she continued those raging fits, as if
she had beheld the battle of Jarnac: Look how they fly, My Son has the
victory; O my God, my God assist my Son, he now is fallen on the earth; See
where the Prince of Conde lies slain under yonder hedge: those that were then
present cried out she raved, and knowing that my Brother of Anjou was about to
join in battle with the enemy, they thought that she had nothing but the
Battle in her head, but the night following Monsieur de Losses brought news of
it, as a desired message, by which he thought to merit much, to whom she said,
you have done me wrong to waken me for that which I knew before, for said she,
Did I not see it yesterday? then they understood, that it was not the raving of
her fever, but a particular prenotion which God does give to rare and
Illustrious persons. The Histories do furnish us with many like examples of
the ancient Heathen, as the apparition of Brutus, and many more which I will
not now rehearse, it being not my intention to beautify my Memorials, but only
to relate the truth and to advance them forward, that you may receive them with
greater speed. Of these divine presages I do not account my self worthy;
neverthesse not ungratefully to conceal the graces and gifts of God which I
have received, and which I ought to confess, and will do throughout all my
life, to give thanks unto him for it, and that every one might praise in me the
wonderful effects of his power, his bounty, and his mercy; I profess that
never any remarkable accident has befaln me either good or evil, of which I
had not before some advertisement, either in a dream or otherwise, and I might
well repeat that verse My mind does still prophetic see,
All good or bad that falls on me.


The truth whereof I proved then at the arrival of the King of Polonia, when
the Queen my Mother met him, although it were so hot a season that we were even
stifled with the throng, while my Brother and the Queen my Mother were
embracing each other, and expressing their reciprocal indeerments, yet so
strange a cold and universal a trembling in every limb and joint possessed
me, that they who attended on me did perceive it; I had much ado to conceal
it, when the King having left my Mother came to salute me. This presage did
touch me to the heart, howsoever there passed some few days before the King
discovered his hate and badde intention which this malicious Guast had made him
to conceive against me. He reported to him that ever since the death of the
King, I took in his absence the part of my Brother of Alenson, and had indeered
him to the King my husband; wherefore watching an occasion to arrive at their
design, which was to break the friendship of my Brother of Alenson and the
King my Husband, by planting dissension betwixt my Husband and my self, and by
tormenting them both with jealous pangs for their common love, and Mistress
the Lady de Sauva, one afternoon the Queen my Mother being retired into her
closet to make some little stay, your Cousin Madame de Nevers, Madame de Raise,
Bourdeille, and Surgeres desired me that I would go forth into the City; on
this motion the young Lady de Mon^igny the Niece of Madame de Vsez told us that
the Abbey of Saint Peter's was a goodly Covent, we resolved to go thither
because she had an Aunt there, and because there was no admission for her
unless with persons of eminent degree; We took her with us, and as we mounted
into the Chariot, although there were six of us in number, besides Madame de
Curton a Dame of honor who was always with me, there was Liancourt the Kings
chief Esquire, and Camillus with him, who threw themselves on the bearing
staves of Torignyes chariot, where holding as fast as they could, and playing
and jeasting where they sat, as they were of a sportfull and frolic
disposition, they said, they would go with us also to see those fair and
religious Ladies; the company of the young Lady of Montigny, who was a mere
stranger to me, and of those two who were the Kings associates, was as I
believe an especial mercy and Providence of God to acquit me from the
imputation of the ensuing slander. We came to that religious house, and my
chariot, which was easy to be known, being gilded over, the groundwork
being yellow velvet, and garnished with silver, did attend us at the door,
near unto which place were the lodgings of many Gentlemen. While we were in
the Abbey, the King going to see Quelus, who then lay sick, having with him the
King my Husband, de O, and Rufus, passed by that place, and seeing my chariot
empty, he turned toward the King my husband, and said, See here where your
Queens chariot is, and here does Bidus lodge, I will lay a wager that she is
there, and commanded Rufus, a fit instrument for such malice, being a friend to
le Guast, to go in, and see, who having found nothing there, yet unwilling
that the truth should hinder the Kings project, spoke alowd before the King my
husband, The birds were there of late, but they are now flowen; this was
sufficient to administer a subject to them for discourse till they returned
home. The King my husband testified in this the Goodness of his Nature and
Understanding, with which he showed himself to be always accompanied, and
detesting in his heart this malice, did easily discover wherefore it was done.
The King made haste to return before me, to possess the Queen my mother with
this Invention, and to make me receive an affront; I arrived presently after he
had the leisure to do me this ill office; when the Queen my mother had spoken
strangely of me before the Ladies, partly for belief, and partly to please her
Son, whom in all things she idolized. On my return (not knowing any thing at
all) as I was going down unto my chamber, with all the troop that accompanied
me to Saint Peter's, I did meet my husband, who as soon as he beheld me, began
to laugh, and said, Go to the Queen your mother, and I assure my self you
will return well chafed thence. I asked him wherefore, and what the business
was? he made answer, I will not tell you, it is sufficient that I believe it
not, these are Inventions to set you and me at distance, and by that means to
estrange me from the freindship of Monsieur your Brother; Seeing I could learn
from him nothing else, I repaired to the Queen my Mother, coming into the
hall, I met with Monsieur de Guise, who seeing this division in our house, was
nothing sorry for it, well hoping himself to collect the pieces of the broken
vessel, who said to me, I wait here Madame to tell you, that the Queen has
entertained a very uncharitable opinion of you, and related to me all the
discourse, which he received from de O, who being then an entire friend of your
Cosins, told it to Monsieur de Guise, to acquaint me with it. I made haste unto
the chamber of the Queen my mother, where she was not to be found, but there I
met with Madame de Nemours, and all the other Princesses and Ladies, who said
unto me, Good God (Madame) the Queen your mother is extremely incensed against
you, I would advise you not to present your self before her. Indeed I would
not, I replied, if I had done what the King has reported of me, but being
altogether innocent, it is requisite that I should speak unto her to acquit my
self. I entered then into her closet, which was made only but of single
wainscot, so that they might understand with ease whatsoever words were spoken;
As soon as she did see me, she began to vent her choler, and to speak
whatsoever a violent and an outrageous passion could deliver. I presented the
truth unto her, and told her that there were ten or twelve of us in company,
beseeching her to enquire, and not only believe those who were my friends and
familiar acquaintance, but Madame de Montigny, who was a stranger to me, and
Liancourt, and Camillus, who depended not but on the King; but she had no ear
either for truth or reason, whether it were that she were prepossessed with the
falsehood, or whither it rather were to comply with the King her Son, whom
with all her affection and endeavors, with all her hopes and fears she
idolized, and ceased not to chide and threaten me; I telling her that the King
was he that raised this report, she grew into a greater choler, and would have
made me believe that it was one of the Grooms of her Chambers who passing by
did see me, but finding that this excuse was too gross that I should receive
it into my belief, and that I remained extremely offended with the King, it
did the more instimulate and torment her; all this was heard into her Chamber
being full of people; departing thence with as much indignation as can be
conceived, I found in my own Chamber the King my Husband, who said unto me, And
have you not found what I told you true? and perceiving me much afflicted;
torment not your self he said, for this Liancourt and Camillus shall attend the
King at his going to rest, and shall acquaint him with the wrong that he has
done you, and I assure my self, to morrow that the Queen your Mother will do
her best to make a perfect agreement; I replied to him, Sir I have received in
this slander too public an affront to pardon those that did procure it, but I
account all but light in regard of the injury they would have done, by pulling
on me so great a mischief, as the loss of your love; he answered, But God be
thanked that is frustrated: to which I replied, yea thanks be to God, and to
your good nature, but from this evil it were requisite we should derive some
benefit, which might serve us for instruction, to have an eye to all their
policies whereby they shall endeavor to work debate betwixt us, for it is to
be believed that since the King has begun to proceed thus far he will not
stay here, nor desist, till he has brohen the bonds of love betwixt my Brother
and your self; whiles I was speaking this, my Brother came, and by a new Oath
I obliged them both to the continuation of their friendship, but what Oath is
of strength in love?

While we were at the Banquet, the King having conferred with Liancourt and
Camillus, and the Lady of Montigny had perceived the error into which the
malice of Rufus had caused him to fall, and being no less careful to recall
it then he was ready to receive it, coming to the Queen my Mother he did
confess the truth unto her, and entreated her that she would be pleased to
excuse it to me, that I might not persevere an enemy against him, fearing much
(because he saw I apprehended the injury) that I knew as aptly to revenge my
self, as he did to offend me. Returning from the banquet, I found the Prophecy
of the King my Husband true, the Queen my Mother sent for me into her back
Cabinet, which was joining to the Kings, where she told me that she had learned
the truth, and had found it to be all false whatsoever the Groom of her Chamber
had related to her; and perceiving by my semblance that I believed not that
pretext, she endeavored by all means to take from me the opinion that it was
the King, and finding it advantaged nothing, the King came presently into her
Cabinet, and made me many and grand excuses, alleging that others made him
believe it, and gave me all the satisfaction and demonstration of friendship
that could be desired. This being passed, having continued at Lions a little
longer, we went into Avignon, Le Guast daring no more invent such impostures,
and seeing by my actions that I gave no regard unto him, he took now another
course by the Lady de Sauva to advance his mischeivous projects, winning her so
far, that she governed all by him, and practicing his instructions no less
dangerous then those of Celestina, she worked the love of my Brother and of the
King my Husband (but light before and flexible, being both but very young) to
such a height and strength, that forgetting all ambition, exercise and design,
they minded nothing else but that Ladies service, and were so strongly jealous
of one another, that although she was courted by Monsieur le Guise, by le
Guast, Sovuray and many others who were all better beloved by her then
themselves, yet these two Brothers neither minded nor feared any thing but the
preferred acceptance and entertainment of each others service; And this woman
the better to play her game persuaded the King my Husband that I grew jealous
of her, and for that cause that I took my Brothers part; we easily believe what
is told us by those we love. He entertaineth this belief, he estrangeth, he
concealeth himself from me more then from any other, which till then he never
did; for till he received this impression he did speak to me always as freely
as to a Sister, knowing that I was no way inclined unto jealousy, but desired
above all things his content, I seeing this which I most feared to come to
pass, which was the removal of his affection from me, for till then I always
enjoyed the freedom and society of his love, and knowing that distrust which
depriveth of familiarity is the beginning of hate, whether it be amongst
friends or kindred, and believing besides that if I could divert the affections
of my Brother from Madame de Sauva, I should overthrow the foundation of le
Guast his invention which he had plotted for our division and ruin, I used my
best endeavor in the behalf of my brother to withdraw him from her, which
would have persuaded any other who had not his Soul enchanted with the love
and subtilty of these fine persons. My Brother who in all other things believed
none more then me, could not in this retain himself for his own safety or
mine, so strong the charms of this Circe were, assisted with the divelish
spirit of le Guast, insomuch that instead of drawing any benefit from my
persuasions, he disclosed to that woman whatsoever privately I had said unto
him: What can we conceal from those we love? she exasperated him the more
against me, and strived with more affection to advance le Guasts designs, and
to perfect her revenge she daily incited the King my Husband to abandon me, in
a manner that he spoke no more unto me: he returned from her very late, and to
deprive him of seeing me, she commanded him always to be early at the rising
of the Queen my Mother to which she was accustomed to go, and all the day
afterward he departed no more from her; my Brother was altogether as careful
in his suit unto her, she making them both believe that most entirely she
affected them which did advance as much their jealousy, as their ruin.

We stayed a long time in Avignon, and a good space after this in Burgundy and
Champagne, as we went to Rhemes to the marriage of the King, and from thence we
came to Paris, where the affairs were carried after the old manner; the
cunning of le Guast by this means did still employ it self to our destruction.
Being at Paris, my Brother did take unto him Bussi, giving that respect unto
him which his valor did deserve, he was always with my Brother, and by
consequence with me, my Brother and I being for the most part continually
together, and giving charge to all his servants to honor and respect me as
himself, his Gentlemen and servants which attended on him fulfilled this his
pleasing command, and with such subjection, that they expressed no less
service to me then to himself: Your Aunt observing this, would tell me
oftentimes that this union betwixt my Brother and my self made her remember the
time of Monsieur de Orleance my Uncle, and Madame de Savoy my Aunt; but Guast
who was the toadstoole of the time, giving a contrary interpretation to it,
imagined that Fortune now had levelled him a fair and easy way by which with
more dexterity he might hasten to the But of his designs, and by the means of
Madame de Sauva being brought into favor with the King my Husband, he
attempted by all the ways that could be devised to persuade him that Bussi
courted me, and seeing he could not prevail with my Husband to believe it,
being sufficiently advertised by his people who were always with him, of my
demeanor, and that there was no appearance for any such suspicion, he addressed
himself to the King whom he found more easy to persuade, as well for the
little good will he did bear my Brother and my self, our friendship being
suspected and hateful to him, as for the secret spleen he did owe to Bussi,
who having sometimes followed him, had left him now, to devote his service to
my Brother: The acquisition of such a servant as much increased the glory of my
Brother, as the envy of our Enemies, there being nothing in this age of his sex
and quality like unto him in valor, reputation, grace and spirit, of whom some
have said if we may believe the transmigration of Souls as some Philosophers
have affirmed, that without doubt the Soul of your brave Brother Hardelay
animated and informed Bussi; The King being possessed with this by le Guast
related it to the Queen my Mother, exhorting her to tell it to the King my
Husband, attempting to put him in the same grievances as he did before at
Lions; but she seeing what small appearance of truth it had, rejected it and
said, I know not what malcontents they are who abuse your fancy with such
suggestions, my Daughter is unhappy to be borne in such an age, In our time we
spoke free to all the world, and to all the Gentlemen that followed the King
your father, Monsieur le Dauphin and Monsieur de Orleance; your Uncles were
ordinarily in your Aunt Margarets Chamber and in mine, and none thought strange
thereat, as there was no reason why they should; Bussi sees my Daughter before
you, before her Husband in his Chamber, this is not in some retired place, or
the door being shut, Bussi is a person of quality, and chief in attendance on
your Brother; what can you collect from this, can any man make more then a mere
slander of it? At Lions you made me give her so great an affront in the same
nature that I am afraid she will remember it while she lives. The King amazed
at this, replied, Madame I speak not but after others, she demanded who are
they my Son? they are those who labor to sow dissension betwixt you and all
yours: The King being gone she repeated all to me, and said, you are born in a
miserable age, and calling in your Aunt Madame de Dampierre she began to
discourse with her of the honest liberty of delights which they enjoyed in
their younger years, without being subject to misconstruction: La Guast seeing
the Mine blown up, and that it took not fire on that side he expected,
addressed himself to some Gentlemen that followed the King my Husband, who till
that time had been companions of Bussi, and were now become his enemies, by
reason of the jealousy which his advancement and his glory had procured him,
they joining to their envious hatred an inconsiderate zeal to the service of
their Master, or to speak more truly, covering their envy with that pretense,
resolved one evening (as he went late from his Masters lying down) to retire
into his own lodging to assault and seize upon him; and because my Brothers
Gentlemen were accustomed to keep him company they knew they should not find
him with less then fifteen or twenty persons, and although he carried no sword
by reason of the wound which a little before he received in his arm, they knew
his presence would be enough to double the courage of his companions:
Apprehending this and indeavoring to make their enterprise assured, they
resolved to assault him with two or three hundred men, the veil of night
covering the shame of such an assault: Le Guast who commanded a Regiment of the
Guard provided them with Soldiers, who putting themselves in five or six
troops in the street through which of necessity he must pass, they charged on
him putting out their Links and Torches. After a volley of Harquebuses and
Pistols, enough not only to entrap a troop of fifteen or twenty persons, but
to defeat a whole Regiment of Soldiers, they hand to hand did combat with
this troop, laboring continually in the mask of night to mark out Bussi,
knowing him by his dove-coloured Scarf in which he carried his wounded arm,
which served at that time well for them, who otherwise would have felt the
strength and vigor of it, but they were so well entertained by those few
honest Gentlemen from whom neither this unexpected encounter, nor the horror
of the night had taken away their judgment, or their courage, that making as
great a proof of their valor as of their affection, to their friend, by fine
force they brought him to his lodging, without losing any of their troop,
saving one Gentleman only who was trained up with him, and being wounded also
in his arm carried it in a dove-coloured scarf as Bussi did, yet differing
much from his, it being nothing so rich as his Masters was, howsoever in the
obscurity of night either the fury or the courage of these assassinates, who
had the word given them to fall on the dove-coloured scarf, prevailed so much,
that all the troops threw themselves on that poor Gentleman and left him dead
in the street. An Italian Gentleman that belonged to my Brother being there,
surprised with fear did run all bloody into the Louure and coming up the
stairs where my Brothers Chamber was, cried out that Bussi was assaulted; my
Brother immediately would have gone to rescue him: By good fortune I was not
then in bed, and was lodged so near unto my Brother that I heard that
affrighted man coming up the stairs, and Proclayming that terrible news as
soon as he. I ran forthwith into his Chamber to hinder him from going down, and
sent to the Queen my Mother to entreat her to come and stay him, seeing the
just grief which he conceived did transport him so beyond himself, that
inconsiderately he would expose himself to any danger to run headlong to
revenge: we retained him with much ado; the Q. my Mother urging there was no
appearance that he should venture himself alone during night, that obscurity did
cover all vilany, that le Guast was mischievous enough to have done it
peradventure on purpose that he might fall into some evil accident. These
words were of little force with him being almost desperate, but she using her
authority stayed him and gave the Porters charge that they should not let him
forth, taking the pains herself to stay with him till he had learned the truth
of all: Bussi whom God had preserved miraculously from that danger troubling
not himself with the hazard of it, his Sou^e being incapable of fear, being
born for a terror to his Enemies, a glory to his Master, a help unto his
friends; as soon as he was entered into his lodging thinking in what a trouble
his Master would be if the news of this encounter were brought uncertainly
unto him, and fearing it might throw him upon the ranks of his enemies, as
without doubt it had, if the Queen my Mother had not prevented it, sent
forthwith one of his servants who brought him the truth and the news of all;
And the day appearing, Bussi without fear of his enemies came into the Louure
with as joyful and as brave a presence, as if the former assassinat had been
to him a turnament of pleasure, My Brother Being also as glad to see him, as
full of indignation to revenge his quarrel, sufficiently did witness how
sensible he was of the affront that was done unto him by attempting to deprive
him of so worthy and so brave a Servant although le Guast could not endure that
Bussi should be ranckt before him, or be seen to take the upper hand.

The Queen my Mother the wisest and most advised that ever was, knowing of what
weights were such effects, and foreseeing that in the end, they might set both
her sons at variance, did counsel my Brother (to take away all pretenses)
that Bussi a while should absent himself from Court, to which my Brother gave
consent, through my entreaties, seeing well that if he stayed, Le Guast would
continue his incendiary devises, and would make him serve as a Cloak for his
pernicious designs, which were to keep at discord my Brother and the King my
Husband as he had done by his aforesaid inventions; Bussi who had no other will
but that of his Masters, departed from the Court accompanied with the bravest
of the Nobility which followed my Brother; this subject was pleasing to Le
Guast, and at the same time seeing the King my Husband one night in a great
weakness in which he fainting swounded oftentimes away, which came unto him as
I believe by an excess which he had made with women, where I served and
assisted him as my duty did command me, at which so much he was contented, that
he praised me to all the world, saying that if I had not perceived him in that
extremity, and run presently to his succor to call my women and his servants
to him, that he had been dead, and for this that he would make far more
deerly of me then hitherto he had. Le Guast seeing also that of late the love
and friendship between my Brother and the King my Husband began to renew it
self, believing that I was the only occasion and instrument thereof, and that I
was to them (as we may see in all natural things, but especially in Serpents
cut) a certain natural balm which does reunite and reconcile* the divided
parts, pursuing always the course of his first pernicious design, and
laboring to contrive some new invention to divide the King my Husband and my
self; did put into the Kings head, who some few days before by the same
inventien of Le Guast had taken from the Queen his most virtuous and sacred
Princess one of her Gentlewomen whom she loved very deerly, and who was
trained up with her, named Changi, he thought it now expedient that the King my
Husband should do the like by me, taking from me her whom I most affected
named Torigny, without any cause or reason but this, That it was not requisite
for young Princesses to have such servants in whom they might repose any
particular confidence; The King persuaded by this wicked fellow talked of it
oftentimes to the King my Husband, who told him that he knew very well that he
should do me a grievous displeasure by it, and if I loved Torigny, I had
occasion so to do, that besides her education with the Queen of Spain my
Sister, and her attendance on me since my Infancy, she was of an excellent
understanding, and who had done him very good service in his captivity at Bois
de Vincennes, that he should be ungrateful should he not remember it, and that
he oftentimes had seen his Majesty himself make deerly of her. In this he
defended himself, but in the end Le Guast persisting continually to incite the
King who telling my Husband that he would never love him more* if by the next
morning he had not taken Torigny from me, he was constrained to his great
grief (as since he often has protested to me) to entreat and command me to
give way unto it, which was so grievous to me that I could not but witness to
him by my tears what an injury and displeasure* I received by it, demonstrating
unto him that what most afflicted me, was not the removal of a Servant who
since my Infancy had been always profitable and dutiful to me, but it being
known how well I loved her, I was not ignorant how great a prejudice this
sudden and forced departure of hers would bring to my reputation; he being
unable to allow these truths by reason of the promise which he made the King to
do me this great displeasure, she went away the same day to a Cousin of hers
called Monsieur de Castelas, I remained so perplexed with this indignity that
no longer able to resist the just griefs that did invade me, but banishing all
Counsel from me, I did so abandon my self unto affliction, that I had not the
power any more to look after the King my Husband; in a manner that Le Guast and
Madame de Sauva on one side estranging him from me, and I estranging my self on
the other, we neither lay nor talked more together.

The Memorialls of Queen MARGARET. The Second Book.
CERTAIN days after, some faithful servants of the King my Husband having
made him understand the artifice by the means whereof he was led unto
destruction, by estranging himself and his affections from my Brother, and my
self, from whom he ought to expect his greatest succor, and growing now into
neglect, as the King began to undervalue him, they caused him to speak unto my
Brother, who since the departure of Bussi had no way amended his condition; for
every day Le Guast caused him to receive some new indignities, and knowing that
they were both in the same condition at Court, being both out of favor, and
that Le Guast alone did govern the world, that they must beg to him for
whatsoever they desired to obtain of the King; and if they chanced to demand
any thing they were rejected with contempt, that if any one had made himself
their servant, he forthwith was cried down, and laden with a thousand slanders
and complaints, perceiving also that their disunion was their ruin, they
resolved to unite and retire themselves from Court, and to assemble their
servants and friends together, to demand of the King a condition and respect
worthy of them, my Brother having not yet the exhibition for his maintenance,
and maintaining himself on certain ill assigned pensions which came unto him
only when it pleased Le Guast, and the King my Husband no way rejoicing in his
government of Guyenne, he being not permitted to go unto it, or to any other of
his Principalities. This resolution being taken, my Brother spoke unto me and
said that they two were now made perfect friends, and that he much desired that
the King my Husband and I should be the like, and entreated me to forget
whatsoever before had passed betwixt us, adding that the King my Husband told
him that he was heartily sorry for it, and now perceived that our enemies were
too strong and subtle for us, that he was resolved now entirely to affect me,
and to grant unto me all desired satisfaction, he besought me also that for my
part I would love him, and in his absence assist him in his affairs; they both
agree on this resolution, that my Brother should depart first, stealing away in
a Caroach, and that certain days after the King my Husband should follow him
under pretense of going to the Chase, being both very sorry that they could not
take me with them, nevertheless assuring themselves, it being known they were
abroad, that none durst offer any violence to me, intending to make it speedily
appear, that their intention was no way to trouble France, but only to
establish a condition worthy of their quality, and to secure their persons, for
among these late troubles they alleged, that they were not without great
danger of their lives: whether this fear of theirs were well grounded or no,
or whether they who desired the ruin and division of our House (the better to
prevail themselves) had caused such alarmes to be given them, by the daily
advertisements they received.

The Evening being come, a little before the supper of the King was served in,
my Brother changing his cloak, and muffling it about his face, went forth
attended only with one Servant, who was not known, and walked on foot as far
as Saint Honorius gate, where he found himself provided with a Caroach which
he borrowed of a Lady for that purpose, into which being mounted, he came as
far as certain houses about a quarter of a mile from Paris, where having
horses that attended him, he there planted himself in the Saddle, and about a
mile from thence, he was saluted by two or three hundred horse of his
servants, who made there their Rendezvous accordingly, as he appointed; they
perceived not at Court his departure, till about nine of the clock in the
evening; the King and Queen my mother demanded of me why he was not at supper
with them, and if he were in health or no; I replied, that I saw him not since
dinner, they sent into his chamber to know what the business was, forthwith it
was returned that he was not there, they gave order that they should search all
the chambers of the Ladies to which he was accustomed to go, they sought him
in the Castle, and in, and round about the City; but they found him not;
Immediately the Alarm waxed hot, the King grew into a rage, and swollen with
choler and despite, he sent to all the Princes and Lords of the Court,
commanding them to take horse, and to bring him back either alive or dead,
urging that he was gone to trouble his estate, and to make war against him,
and that he would make him understand the folly he committed in opposing a
Prince so puissant as himself. Many of the Princes and Lords refused this
commission, demonstrating unto the King, of what importance it was, and that
they would engage their lives in the service of his Majesty, as their duties
did oblige them, but to go against Monsieur his Brother, they well knew that
the day would come, when his Majesty would give them but little thanks for it,
and assured him that my Brother would undertake nothing that might be
displeasing to his Majesty, or prejudicial to the State, that peradventure it
was some discontent that invited him to remove from Court, and thereupon it
were expedient that the King should first send unto him to inform himself of
the occasion that moved him to depart, before he took a resolution to proceed
against him with so extreme a rigor; but others there were that accepted this
commission, and prepared themselves to take horse, their diligence could not
make that dispatch, but it was first upon the break of day, which was the cause
that they could not find my brother, and were constrained to return, as being
not in equipage of war; The King for all this was not more favorable to the
King my husband, but looked with the same eye of disregard upon him as before,
the which confirmed him in his resolution, so that within a few days after, he
retired himself from Court, pretending that he was gone on hunting. For me, the
tears which (all that night after my Brothers departure) were my companions,
had brought on the next morning so great a Rewme on one side of my face, that
by reason of a fever, I was constrained certain days to keep my bed, being
very ill, and overcome with many sorrows, during which time of sickness, the
King my husband, whether he was busied to prepare for his departure, or whether
being about to leave the Court, he would bestow on pleasure the little time he
had to stay, and delight himself with the presence and company of his Mistress
Madame de Sauva, had not the leisure to visit me, but retiring to his rest at
his accustomed hours, which were about one or two a clock after midnight, I
knew not of his coming, we lying in two beds, as our usual manner was, and
rising before I was awake to be at the rising of the Queen my mother, to which
as I have said, Madame de Sauva was accustomed to go, he not so much as spoke
unto me, as he promised my Brother, and departed in the same manner, without
bidding me farewell: For all this, I was suspected by the King to be the only
cause of his departure, who was so incensed against me, that if he had not been
retained by the Queen my mother, I believe his choler had wrought some cruelty
against my life, but restrained by her, and daring not doe-worse, he suddenly
whispered in my mothers ear, that it were requisite, I had a Guard set over
me; to keep me from following the King my husband, and to debar any from
coming to me, that I might not advertise my Brother and him of the occurrences
at Court. The Queen my Mother willing to do all things with clemency, told
him, that she held it also to be very necessary, being very glad that she had
rebated a little the first edge and fury of his Choler, but said withal, that
she would go and prepare me to endure my bondage with patience, alleging that
those grievances would not always continue in the same terms, that all
things in this world had two faces, that the first which was dark and
frightfull, being turned, when we should come to behold the second more sweet
and smiling, that on those new events, we would take new counsels, that then
peradventure he might have need of my service, that as wisdom did advise him
to live with his friends, as chancing one day to prove his enemies, and
therefore not too much to trust them, so friendship dissolving, and being of
power to hurt, the same wisdom did counsel him to use his enemies, as
chancing one day to prove his friends.

These demonstrances withheld the King from doing me any hurt, to which he had
a great desire, but le Guast assisted him with an Invention to discharge his
choler another way, and caused him (to do me the greatest displeasure in the
world) to send some swordmen to the house of Chastelas the Cousin of Torigny,
and under pretense of bringing her to the King to drown her in the river that
was near unto his house; they being arrived, Chastelas gave them free
admission into his house, not doubting any thing; they seeing her, the
strongest of them using as much indiscretion as violence in the ruinous charge
which was committed to them, took hold of Torigny, and binding her, did lock
her in a chamber till their horses were bayted; in the mean time, behaving
themselves after the French manner, not regarding what might happen, they
crammed themselves up to the very throats with the best provision that the
house afforded. Chastelas, who was a discreet man, not caring at all if by the
expense of his victuals, he could gain any time to defer the departure of
his Cousin, hoping that who has time, has life, and that God might change the
Kings heart, and countermand those people to desist from so great a cruelty,
durst not enterprise by any other way to hinder them, though he had friends and
means enough, but God who always looked on my affliction, to deliver me from the
danger and indignities which my enemies procured me, prepared an unexpected
succor to rescue Torigny, which was this; Certain grooms and Chamberlaines
having fled for fear of these spoylers, who kept a knocking and a bouncing
within* as in a house of pillage, being gone some quarter of a mile from the
house, God guided that way, la Ferte and Avantigny with their troops, who were
about two hundred horse, and were now going to join themselves to the Body of
my Brothers army, and it happened that amongst the troops of Peasants, La
Ferte beheld a Servant of Chastelas, with an afflicted and doleful
countenance, and knowing him, asked if there were any Soldiers, who passing by
that way, had done his master wrong, the groom answered no, and that the cause
which so tormented him, was the extremity in which he left his Master, for the
violence offered to his Cousin; Immediately La Ferte and Avantigny resolved to
do me that good office, to deliver Torigny, praising God, that gave them so
good an occasion to witness their service and affection to me, and galloping
in full speed, they and all their troops arrived so aptly at Chastelas his
house, that they found these rude fellows on the point of putting Torigny on a
horse, to lead her out to ^rowne her; the Horsemen coming all into the Court
with their Swords drawn, cried out, Forbear you Villains, if you do her any
violence, you are but dead! and charging on them, they did fly away, leaving
their prisoner transported now with joy, as before with fear, and having
thanked God and them for this so needful a deliverance, she caused the
Chariot of her Cousin Chastelas to be made ready, and accompanied with him,
went with this guard of honest men to find my Brother, who was very glad being
not able to have me with him, to have there one whom so entirely I affected.

While the King made this goodly dispatch to sacrifice Torigny to his anger,
the Queen my Mother who knew nothing of it came into my Chamber to visit me,
as I was then making my self ready, determining with my self, though I was
troubled with the rhewme, yet more sick in mind then body by reason of the
afflictions which possessed me, to go that day abroad to see a little the
course of the world on these new accidents, being always in fear least they
should enterprise any thing against my Brother and the King my Husband; My
Mother said unto me, Daughter you need not make such haste to dress you,
grieve not I pray at what I shall deliver, I assure my self that you do not
think it strange that the King finds himself offended with your Brother and
your Husband, and knowing the friendship that is between you, believing that
you knew of their departure he is resolved to keep you as a hostage of them; he
knows how your Husband loves you, and that he cannot have a better gage of him
than you, for this cause he has commanded that a Guard should be set over you,
to hinder you that you should not stir from your Chamber: His Counsel also
has represented to him, that if you were at freedom amongst us, you would
discover whatsoever is intended against your Brother and your Husband, and
acquaint them with it. I desire you not to grow impatient at this restraint, it
shall not God willing last long, grieve not your self that I dare not come
unto you as often as I would, for I am afraid to give suspicion to the King,
but assure your self I will not permit that any violence shall be done unto
you, and I will labor to the uttermost of my power to conclude a peace for the
reconcilement of your Brothers. I represented to her how great was the injury
that in this I did receive; I would not deny but that my Brother did always
communicate to me his just discontents, but for the King my Husband, since
Torigny was taken from me, we had not so much as talked together, that he came
not to visit me in my sickness, nor yet did so much as bid me adieu when he
went away: she replied these be ordinary complaints between a Husband and a
Wife, but I know that with kind words and letters he will regain your heart,
and if he should send you word to come unto him, that you would go, to which
the King my Son will no way give consent. She returning I remained certain
months in that estate, having not any, not so much as my familiar and most
private friends that came to see me, for fear of the Kings displeasure. At
Court adversity is always alone, as prosperity is accompanied, and persecution
is seldom any where assisted with true and constant friends; only the brave
Grillon was he who despising all prohibitions came five or six times into
Chamber so astonishing and frighting the Cerberusses that were set to guard my
my door, that they durst neither grant, nor deny him entrance: During this
time the King my Husband being arrived in his government, and having assembled
his friends and servants they did demonstrate unto him what an unkindnesse and
injury he committed in not taking his leave of me, nor in so much as bidding me
farewell at his departure, telling him that I had understanding enough to do
him service, and that it was needful to regain me, that he should receive much
profit by my love and by my presence, if things being reconciled, he could have
me with him. He was easy to be persuaded to this, being removed from that
Circe Madame de Sauva whose charms had lost their force by her absence, which
in her presence rendered him without reason to apprehend the policies of our
adversaries, and that the separation and division betwixt us was as
prejudicial to himself as unto me; he wrote unto me a very honest letter in
which he desired me to forget whatsoever had passed betwixt us, and to believe
that for the time to come he entirely would affect me, which he would make more
apparent to me then heretofore he had done, commanding me to advertise him of
the passages of the Court-affaires, and of my own estate, and of my Brothers,
for though they were friends, they were removed from intelligence, my Brother
being in Champagne and the King my Husband in Gascony; I received that letter
being yet a Captive which brought much comfort to me, and I failed not
afterward (although the Guard were commanded that I should not be suffered to
write) being aided with necessity the Mother of invention, to send oftentimes
my letters to him.

Certain days after my restraint, my Brother knew of my captivity, which did
so much incense him, that had he not planted in his heart as great an affection
to his Country, as he had a part and interest in the State, he had made so
cruel a war, as he had then the means, commanding a brave army, that the
people had endured the punishment for the error of their Prince, but retained
by that natural obligation and affection, he wrote to the Queen my Mother,
that if they used me so ungently they would throw him into the bottom of
despair, she fearing to see the occasion of this war brought to such an
extremity, that she knew not how to pacify it, represented to the King of
what importance it was, and found him disposed to receive her reasons, his
anger being qualified by the knowledge of the danger wherein he was, being
seized on in Languedock, Gascogny, Dauphine, and Poictou by the King my
Husband, and the Huguenots, who held many goodly Towns and forts; and by my
Brother in Champagne who had a great army composed of the bravest of the
nobility in France, and since this departure of my Brother, being himself not
able either by persuasions, threatenings, or commands, to make any take horse or
to oppose my Brother, all the Princes and Lords of France providently
forbearing to put their finger betwixt two grinding Milstones; All this
considered, the King gave open ear to the Declaration of the Queen my Mother,
and was as desirous as her self to have a Peace established, entreating her
that she would be pleased to be a means thereof. She presently prepared her
self to go unto my Brother demonstrating unto the King that it was necessary
to take me with her, but the King would not consent unto it, believing that I
did serve him as a sufficient hostate, thereupon she took her journey without
me, and without so much as speaking to me, when my Brother seeing that I was
not with her, represented the just discontents which he received, and the
indignities and rough usage which he found at Court, adding thereunto the
injuries which were done to me by keeping me in durance, and the cruelty which
to displease me they more then offered to Torigny, protesting that he would
lend no ^are to any overture of peace until the wrongs which they had done me
were redressed, and till he saw me satisfied, and free. The Queen my Mother
hearing this, returned, and declared to the King what answer my Brother sent
unto him, and that it were requisite if he desired a peace that she should go
back again, but for her to go without me, her journey would be so
unprofitable, that it would rather increase, then mitigate the Evil, as also
to take me with her, without having first contented me, it might do more hurt
then good, and that it was to be feared that I would return no more, but from
thence would repair to the King my Husband, that it was necessary to take away
the guard that was set over me, and to find a means to make me forget the
rough usage which I received. This the King found good, and seemed as much
affected to it as her self. Immediately she sent for me, and told me that she
had prevailed so much, that she had prepared things to a way of peace, that she
knew that my Brother and my self did ever desire the benefit of the State, that
she could conclude a peace so advantageous to my Brother, that he should have
occasion to rest himself content, and be free from the tyrany of Le Guast, or
whatsoever other malicious Spirit did possess the King against him, and that
if I would assist her in making the accordance betwixt the King and my Brother,
I should deliver her from a great and insupportable calamity, she being unable
without a grief as strong as death to receive the tidings of the Victory of
the one, or other of her sons, she desired me that the injuries I received
might not transport me rather to thoughts of vengeance, then of peace; she told
me that the King was sorry, that she had seen him weep, and that he would give
me such satisfaction, that I should remain contented with it: I replied to
her, that I never would prefer my private Good to the Benefit of the State,
for the improvement and safety whereof, I would willingly sacrifice my life,
and that I desired nothing more then a happy peace, to the effecting whereof, I
would devote my self, and all my endeavors; on this, the King came into her
cabinet, and with a multitude of fair words did labor to give me
satisfaction, and incited me to his friendship, finding that neither my
deportment, nor my words gave him any appearance of the injuries I received,
which I did more in contempt of the offense that he had done unto me, then for
any satisfaction to him, having passed the time of my captivity in the pleasure
and exercise of reading, in which I then began to delight my self, owing this
obligation not to Fortune, but to the divine Providence, which then began to
provide me so great a remedy to relieve my self in the afflictions which were
prepared for me, which served me also as an introduction to devotion, reading
in that fair and universal book of Nature, so many wonders of the creator of
it; for every well tempered Soul, rearing to it self a ladder by this
knowledge, of which GOD is the last and highest round, ravished thereat, does
address himself to the adoration of the admirable light of that
incomprehensible Essence, and making a perfect circle, delights not in any
thing but to follow that Homerick chain, that exquisite Ring of Knowledge
which proceeds from God himself, the beginning and end of all things; And
sadness, contrary to Joy, which gives us not leave to consider our own
actions, rouzeth up the Soul in its self, which uniting all her forces to
reject the evil, and to embrace the good, thinks, and thinks again
incessantly, to choose this Sovereign bliss, in which we may find peace with
confidence, and these are those pious dispositions that prepare us to arrive at
the knowledge and the love of God. I received these two benefits from the
solitude and grief of my captivity, to addict my self to reading and
devotion, of which, before I scarce had tasted, amidst the vanity and pomp of
my prosperous Fortune. The King as I have said, seeing in me no appearance of
discontent, told me that the Queen my mother should return unto my Brother in
Champagne, to mediate a peace, and besought me to accompany her, and to do
there all the good offices I could, for he knew (he said) that my Brother
reposed more trust in me, then in any other in the world, and that whatsoever
Good should arise from thence, he would give me the honor of it, and profess
himself obliged to me; I promised him what I resolved to perform, for it
conduced to the Benefit of my Brother, and the State, so to imply my self, as
he by it should receive contentment. The Queen my mother did depart, and I with
her, and coming to Sens, the conferrence was held in a Gentleman's house a mile
from thence. The morning following, we came to the place of conference, my
Brother was there in person, accompanied with some of his own troops, and
with the principal Lords and Catholic Princes of his Army, among whom also
was Duke Casimire, and Colonel Poux, who brought unto him six thousand
Reisters, by the means of those of the Religion, who were joined with my
Brother in the behalf of the King my Husband. For many days they treated on
the peace, and the conditions of it, having many disputations on the articles,
especially on those which concerned the Huguenots, and the agreement was made
with conditions more advantageous to them, then they themselves could wish, as
presently after it appeared. The Queen my mother, the peace being concluded,
persuaded my Brother to send back the Reisters, and to retire himself from
those, from whom (being ever a good Catholic) he had a great desire to
separate himself, not willing to be served by Huguenots, but only for
necessity. In this peace, there was an Estate assured to my brother for his
maintenance according to his quality, in which my Brother would have me
comprised, being very earnest, that the assignation of my dowry in Lands might
be established, and Monsieur de Beauvais, who was deputed there a party for
him, insisted on it very strongly; but the Queen my Mother did entreat me that
I would not give way unto it, and assured me that I should receive of the King
what I would demand, on which I did request them, that they would not
comprehend me in the Articles, and that whatsoever I had conferred on me, I had
rather receive it from the grace and bounty of the King and Queen my mother,
believing that it would be a course more beneficial, and as assured to me.

The peace concluded, and assurance taken on the one side, and on the other,
the Queen my mother preparing her self for her return, I received letters
from the King my Husband, by which I understood that he had a great desire to
see me, entreating me, that as soon as I saw the peace concluded, to sue for
leave to come unto him: I besought the Queen my mother, who rejected my
petition, and by all means possible indeavored to divert me from it, saying,
That when I received not her proposition to disanull our marriage, after the
massacre of S. Bartholomew, she then commended my resolution, because my
husband was made a Catholic, but now, since he has abandoned the Catholic
Religion, and is turned Huguenot, she could not permit that I should go unto
him, and seeing I daily renewed my petition, she told me with tears in her
eyes, that if I returned not with her, she should for ever loose her credit
with the King, adding, that the King would believe that she had taken me with
her for that intent, and that she had made a solemn promise to him to bring me
back, she desired me to stay till my Brothers return, which she said should be
with speed, and that suddenly after, she would take order for my dispatch to
the King my Husband.

Some few days after, we returned to the King to Paris, who by reason of the
peace, received us with great joy, yet not well liking the advantageous
conditions of the Huguenots, and determining with himself, as soon as he had
got my Brother to Court, to find some new Invention to begin the war again,
and not let them joy in that, to which to his grief he condiscended, to
withdraw my brother from them, who stayed yet behind a month or two, to give
order for sending back the Reisters, and for the dismissing of his army, He
arrived not long after at Court, with all the Catholic Nobility that assisted
him; the King received him with all honor, seeming to have great joy to see
him there, and he made very much of Bussi also, who came with him, for Le Guast
was lately dead, being slain by the judgment of God as he was in course of
physic; he had a body infected with all sort of villainies, and subject to a
corruption, which a long time did possess it, as the Devils did his soul, to
whom he did homage by Magic, and all sort of wickedness; this Brand of fire
and division being taken from the world, and the King having his thoughts bent
only on the ruin of the Huguenots, intended to make use of my Brother to
command against them, to render my brother and them unreconcileable, and
fearing also that to prevent it, I would hasten to the King my husband, he
entertaind us both, as well the one, as the other, with all the pleasures that
the Court could yield, to make our stay there more delightful; and seeing at
the same time that Monsieur de Duras was sent from the King my husband to
demand me, and with so much importunity I urged to be gone, that he no longer
could deny me, he told me (showing first it was the love he did bear unto me,
and then the knowledge what a Grace and ornament I brought unto his Court, which
caused him so long to suspend my journey) that he would now conduct me himself
as far as Poictiers, and returned Monsieur de Duras with that assurance.

Certain days after, he stayed at Paris, deferring, and not openly refusing
to give me leave to go, till he had all things in readiness for the
declaration of his designed war against the Huguenots, and by consequence
against the King my Husband, and to give a pretense unto it, they caused a
rumor to be spread, that the Catholics complained of the advantageous
conditions, to which they accorded with the Huguenots at the peace of Sens.
This murmur and discontent of the Catholics was blown abroad, that they came
to League and unite themselves at Court from all the Cities and provinces of
the Kingdom, enrouling, and signing themselves, and making a great noise (but
privately with the Kings consent) that they would choose Monsieur de Guise for
Chief; there was no other thing spoken of from Paris until you come to Blois,
where the King had called the States together, during the overture of whom, the
King called my Brother into his cabinet with the Queen my mother, and some of
the Lords of his counsel, and presented there unto him, of what importance for
his Authority and estate was this league, which the Catholics had begun,
especially if they should come to make themselves heads, and to choose those of
the House of Guize; that it concerned them (understanding my brother and
himself) more then all the rest, that the Catholics had reason to complain,
and that his duty and conscience did oblige him to discontent the Huguenots
rather then the Catholics, he entreated and conjured my Brother, as an heir
of France, and a true Catholic, that he would counsel and assist him in this
affayre, whereon the hazard of his Crown, and the Catholic Religion so much
depended, adding that it seemed to him to cut off all danger that this League
might bring, that he himself ought to make the chief, and both to show his
zeal to his Religion, and to debar them from choosing any other, to sign
himself first as Chief, and then to have my Brother sign, and afterward all
the Princes, Lords and Governors, and whosoever had any charge or power in his
Kingdom. My Brother could not but offer that service which he owed to his
Majesty, and to the preservation of the Catholic Religion. The King having
taken assurance of my Brothers assistance, which was the principal end to
which the artifice of the League did tend, did suddenly call all the Princes
and Lords together, and causing the roll of the said League to be brought unto
him, he first there signed himself as Chief, and then my Brother, and after
him all the rest, who had not yet signed. The morning following, they opened
the Estates, having taken advice of the three Lord Bishops of Lions, of Ambrum,
and of Vienne, who persuaded him that after the oath made at his consecration,
no oath made unto the Heretics could be of power, the said oath nullifying all
other oaths and promises which he could make unto the Huguenots: this being
pronounced at the opening of the States, and war being proclaimed against the
Huguenots; the King sent back Genislac, who had been there to hasten my
departure, with rough and threatening language: telling him that he gave his
sister to a Catholic, and not unto a Huguenot, and if that the King my husband
had a desire to have me, he should turn Catholic again; all preparations for
the war were made, there nothing else was spoken of at Court, and to render
my brother more unreconcileable with the Huguenots, the King made him Chief of
one of his Armies. Genislac being come to tell me this sad farewell, which the
King had given him, I repaired presently to the closet of the Queen my mother,
where I found the King, and complained how he had abused me with delays,
having always hindered me from going to the King my husband; and now
dissembled to depart from Paris, to conduct me to Poictiers, to express an
effect so contrary. I represented to him, that I was not married for pleasure,
or to satisfy my own desires, but that it was the desire of King Charles,
conjoined with my mothers, and his own, that since they had given me to him,
they could not hinder me from running my fortune with him, that I would go
unto him, and if they refused to give me leave, I would steal away in what
disguise and fashion that I could, though with the hazard of my life. The King
answered, It Is not now a time (my Sister) to importune me for leave, and I
profess the truth which you have said, that I have deferred your going for a
while, to deny it in the end for altogether; for since the King of Navarre
has turned again to be a Huguenot, I never thought it good that you should go
unto him; that which we have done, the Queen my mother, and my self, is for
your safety. I will make war against the Huguenots, and root out that
Religion, which does us so much mischief, and there is not the least appearance
of reason why you, who are a Catholic, and my sister, should be in their hands
as an hostage of me, and who knows not, but to procure unto me an irreparable
loss, they may revenge themselves on your life for the evil which I shall
bring upon them; no, no, you shall not go, and if you steal away, as you say
you will, understand that you shall have me and the Queen your Mother for your
cruel enemies, and you shall feel our anger to the uttermost of our power, and
shall rather impair, then amend the condition of your husband. I retired my
self with great displeasure from that cruel sentence, and taking the advice of
the principal of my friends at Court, they declared, that it would ill become
me to be resident in a Court so contrary to the king my husband, and from
whence so openly they made war against him, and counseled me, as long as the
wars continued, to retire my self from Court, and were it possible, it were
more honorable for me to find some pretense to go out of the kingdom, under
the color of pilgrimage, or to visit some of my kindred; Madame de
Roche-sur-yon was one of those whom I assembled to desire their counsel, who
was then upon her departure to go to the waters of Spau. My brother was also
present, and had brought Mondoucet with him, who was Agent for the King in
Flanders, and being lately returned, represented to the King, with what grief
the Flemmings suffered the usurpation which the Spaniards made on the Laws of
France, for the dominion, and sovereignty of Flanders; that many of the Lords
and Commons of their cities had expressly commanded him to acquaint his Majesty
how much they stood addicted to the French, and that they would lend him all
their helping hands. Mondoucet, seeing the King gave no ear to his advise,
having nothing in his head, but the Huguenots, who were now to feel the
vengeance of his displeasure, for assisting my brother against him, talked no
more unto him of it, but addressed himself unto my Brother, who having the true
nature of a Prince, loved only to enterprise great and glorious things, being
borne rather to conquer, then preserve; he suddenly embraced the enterprise,
which pleased him so much the more, because he perceived nothing of injustice
in it, willing to regain that unto France, which was usurped by the Spaniards;
Mondoucet for this cause became my Brothers servant, who sent him back to
Flanders under the color of accompanying Madame the Princess of Roche-sur-yon
to the waters of Spau, and he observing that, during these wars, every one
sought a fair pretense to withdraw me from France, whether it were into Savoy,
or into Lorrayne, or to Saint Claudes, or to our Lady of Loretto, whispered
these words into my brothers ear, Sir* if the Queen of Navarre could pretend
any malady, which the waters of Spau, whither Madame the Princess of
Roche-sur-yon is now going, might serve for cure, this would fall out very
fortunately for you: my brother much commended his counsel, and being very
glad of the discovery of it, suddenly cried out, My deer Queen, study no more,
for you must go to the waters of Spau, whether Madame the Princess is going;
I have sometimes heard you complain of a swelling in your arm, you are to say
that your Physicians did then prescribe it, but the season was not fitting, but
now the time is seasonable, and you must entreat the King to give you leave to
go. My Brother declared not himself at that time, wherefore he desired the
journey, because that Monsieur the Cardinal of Burbon was then in company,
whom he suspected for a Guisian, and inclined to the Spanish faction. For my
self, I understood it very well, not doubting but it reflected on his
enterprise for Flanders, of the which Mondoucet had spoken to us both. All the
company were of this advise, and Madame the Princess of Roche-sur-yon, who her
self was going thither, and who loved me entirely, with great joy did
apprehend and entertain this counsel, and promised to go with me to the Queen
my mother, to have her grant consent unto it. On the morning following, we
found the Queen alone, and I represented unto her, what a displeasure it was
unto me, to see the King my husband in a war against the King, and to be thus
removed, and kept asunder from him, that while this war continued, it were
neither expedient nor honorable for me to stay at Court, where if I still
continued, I could not avoid one of these two Evils, either that the King my
husband would conceive that I stayed at Court only for my own pleasure, and
that I assisted him not as I ought to do, or that the King would entertain an
opinion, that I sent daily advertisements to the King my husband, that both the
one and the other would procure unto me much affliction; I besought her that
she would be pleased to think well of it, if for a while I estranged my self
from Court, to avoid all occasions of suspicion, that some time was passed,
since the Physicians prescribed me the waters of Spau, for the swelling of my
arm, to which I had a long time been subject, and that the season of the year
being now fitted for it, this journey by her permission would fall out
opportunely, not only to remove me from Court, but from France also; and so
the King my husband might understand, that being unable to be with him by
reason of the Kings distrust, I would not remain in that place where war was
made against him, and that I hoped that her wisdom would so dispose of things
in time, that the King my husband should obtain a peace of the King, and
return into his favor, that I would attend to hear that happy news, to have
then permission to repair unto him, and that in this voyage to the Spau,
Madame the Princess of Roche-sur-yon (who was there present) would do me the
honor to accompany me. The Queen my mother did much applaude my resolution,
and told me that she was glad that I had taken this advise, affirming that this
evil counsel which the Bishops gave the King, not to make good his promises,
but to break whatsoever he had contracted with the Huguenots for him, had for
many considerations, brought her much affliction, especially seeing this
impetuous torrent drew along with it, and ruined the most understanding, and
the faithfullest servants that the King had in his counsel (for the King had
thereupon removed four or five of the most noble and apparent in all his
Counsel) Moreover she affirmed, it left a deep impression in her, to see the
truth of what I represented, that staying at Court, I could not avoid one of
those two evils, either that the King my husband would dislike that stay, and
be off^nded at it, or that the King would distrust me, supposing that I gave
intelligence to the King my husband, she said that she would persuade the King
to give consent unto the voyage, which she did, and the King discoursed with me
of it, without the least appearance of being angry, being well content that he
had diverted me from my husband, whom he hated more then all the world besides,
and commanded that a Post should be dispatched to Don John of Austria, who
commanded in Flanders for the King of Spain, to entreat him to give me
necessary warrants to pass freely through the country of his Authority,
because I must of necessity travel through Flanders to go to the waters of
Spau, which are in the lands belonging to the Bishop of Liege.

This being determined, we severed our selves for a little space, during which
time my Brother employed himself to instruct me in some desired offices
concerning his enterprise in Flanders, and the King and Queen my mother
removed to Poictiers, to be nearer the army of Monsieur de Mayenne, who
besieged Brovage, and who from thence was to pass into Gascogny, to make war
against the King my husband. My brother also was to march with another army, of
which he was Commander, to besiege Issoire, and some other Towns which shortly
after he took in, and I prepared my self for my Journey into Flanders, attended
with Madame the Princess of Roche-sur-yon, with Madame de Tournon, my Dame of
honor, with Madame de Mouy of Picardie, with Madame La Chastelayne of Millon,
with Madamoselle d' Atrie, with Madamoselle de Tournon, and with seven or eight
Gentlewomen more, and with Noblemen, as Monsieur the Cardinal of Lenoncourt,
with Monsieur the Bishop of Langres* with Monsieur de Mouy Lord of Picardie,
with the chief Esquires, and many other Gentlemen of my house. This company
gave such delight to strangers, who found it so full of state and luster, that
they had France in far more admiration: My litter was of Carnation velvet,
imbroydered with works of Gold and Silk. The invention of the work, and the
Impresses were easy to be seen; this Litter was glazed round, and every
glass had a device in it, there being in the works of Velvet, and in the
glass, forty different Inventions, with Italian and Spanish Mottoes on the
Sun, and his effects; this litter was followed with the litter of Madame the
Princess of Roche-sur-yon, and with the litter of Madame de Tournon, my Dame
of Honor, and with ten waiting Gentlewomen on Horse, with their governesse,
and with six caroaches, in which the rest of the Ladies and women were.

I passed through Picardie, where the Cities had commandment from the King to
receive me as if himself were present, and they did me all the honor that I
could desire. Being arrived at Castelet, which is a fort three miles from the
frontire of Cambresis, the Bishop of Cambray, whose Church acknowledged not
then the King of Spain, but for her Protector, sent a Gentleman unto me, to
know the hour of my departure thence, intending to meet me at my entrance into
his Lands, where I found him well attended with people, who had the habit and
appearance of true Flemmings, as they are very gross in those parts. The Bishop
was of the House of Barlemont, one of the Principal houses in Flanders, but
who in a Flemmish breast had a Spanish heart, as they made it apparent to me,
being one of those that did most assist Don John, but yet he received me with
great honor, and no less Spanish ceremonies. I found this City of Cambray,
although not builded with such strong materials as curs of France, yet far
more delightful, the Cities and houses thereof being better disposed, and
proportioned, and the Churches very fair and large, a common ornament to all
the Towns in France; that which I found in this City most remarkable, was
the Cittadell, one of the strongest and fairest in Christendom, which being
since under the obedience of my Brother, the Spaniards to their costs have
proved. A noble and worthy Gentleman, Monsieur de Ainsi was the Governor of
it, who in grace, in presence, and all qualities requisite to a perfect
Gentleman, was nothing inferior to our most accomplished Courtiers, and no way
partaking of that natural clownishnesse, which seems proper to the
Flemmings. The Bishop made us a banquet, and delighted us after supper, with
the pleasure of a Mask, to which all the Ladies of that City came, but being
there himself not present (for suddenly after the supper, he retired himself,
being as I have said, of a Spanish and ceremonious humor) Monsieur de Ainsi,
the most apparent in that troop, was left behind, to entertain me at the
Mask, and to have me afterward to a Collation of confects, but very
unadvisedly, as I conceive, for this was he who had the charge of the
Cittadell; I speak this having learned it to my own expense, and knowing more
(then I would desire) what belongs to the guarditg of such a place. The
remembrance of my brother being not to be divided from my heart, because I
loved nothing more then him, I often did think on the instructions which he
had given me, and seeing a fair opportunity offered to do him good service
in his enterprise for Flanders, this City and Cittadell being the key thereof,
I quickened and employed all the understanding which God had given me to render
Monsieur de Ainsi affectioned to France, and more particular to my Brother, God
gave such a blessing to my discourse, that he delighted with it, determined to
stay with me as long as possibly he could, and to accompany me during the time
I stayed in Flanders, and to this intent, he demanded leave of his master to
go with me to Namur, where Don John of Austria did attend me, saying, That he
desired to see the triumphs of that entertainment. This Flemming Spanioliz'd
was notwithstanding so ill advised to let him go, during this voyage, which
continued ten or twelve days, he spoke unto me as often as he could, openly
demonstrating that he had a heart addicted to the French, and that he only
desired to live to see the hour wherein he might have so brave a Prince as my
Brother for his Lord and Master, despising the service and commands of his
Bishop, who although he was his Sovereign, was but a Gentleman as himself,
and far inferior to him in the qualities and graces both of mind and body.

Departing from Cambray, I lodged the night ensuing at Valenciennes in Flanders
where Monsieur the Count of Lalain, Monsieur de Montigny his brother, and many
other Gentlemen to the number of two or three hundred came to receive me at my
coming out of the principality of Cambresis, unto which place the Bishop of
Cambray conducted me. Being arrived at Valenciennes, a Town inferior to
Cambray in force, but not in the ornament of goodly buildings and of Churches,
where the fountains and the Clocks with industry proper to the Almains gave
not a little cause of wonder to the French, it being not ordinary with them to
hear the clocks ^xpresse a pleasant Music of the voice, with as many sorts of
persons as are in the little Castle in the Suburbs of Saint Germans: Monsieur
the Count of Lalain, the City being under his government, made a feast to the
Lords and Gentlemen of my ^roupe, where his wife and his fair Sister Madame de
Aurec and the most remarkable and bravest Ladies of that country attended to
receive me; He told me he was Cousin to the King my Husband, and he was a person
of great authority and estate, to whom the Spainish insolence was always
odious, being strongly incensed against them since the death of the Count of
Aigmont who was his near kinsman, and although he maintained his government
without being leagued with the Prince of Orange or the Huguenots, being a
thrice Catholic Lord, yet he could not endure to see Don John, or permit that
either he or any of his should enter into his government, Don John not daring
force him to the contrary, fearing that then the Catholic league in Flanders
called the League of the Estates would unite themselves with the Prince of
Orange and the Huguenots, wisely foreseeing, what a storm and tempest would
ensue, as they have proved since who have governed there for the King of Spain.
The Count of Lalain could not sufficiently express what a joy he did receive
to see me, and if his native Prince had then been present, he could not be
received with more honor and demonstrations of welcome and affection.
Arriving at Monts at the Countes of Lalain with about fourscore or a hundred
Ladies of the City and Country, of whom I was received not as a strange
Princess, but as if I had been their Sovereign by the privilege of
inheritance, the disposition of the Femmings is to be private, merry, and
familiar, and the Countess of Lalain being of this disposition, and having a
great and high Spirit, it gave me presently an assurance that it were no
difficult matter to enter into a strict friendship with her: The hour of
supper being come, she went to the Banquet, and after to dancing which the
Count of Lalain continued all the time of my abode at Monts, which was longer
then I determined, intending to depart the morning following, but this good
woman enforced me to stay a seventh night with them, which I was unwilling to
do, fearing to overcharge them, nor was it possible for me to persuade her
husband or her self, but they enforced me to stay till the eighth day were
expired, living with such familiarity with me, she stayed at my lying down very
late, and would have stayed longer but that she did what was very rare to do
in persons of her quality, which notwithstanding did witness a nature attended
with great goodness, she nourished her infant with her own milk so that being
one morning at the feast, and sitting next unto me at the table which is the
place where they of that Country do communicate themselves with greatest
friendship, and aiming at nothing but my content, which was altogether to
advance my Brothers designs in Flanders, she being curiously dressed and almost
covered with precious stones and rich imbroyderies, having on a Kirtle of
cloth of gold, whose ground was black, wrought with curious works of
imbroydery and purles of gold and silver, and a doublet of Cloth of silver
whose ground was white, wrought with flowers of gold, and buttoned with great
diamonds (a habit proper to the office of a Nurse) they brought unto the table
her little child, as richly dressed as was the Nurse that gave it suck, she
set the Child on the table betwixt us both, and freely unbuttoning her self
she gave her breast unto her little one; this had been counted incivility in any
else, but she did do it with so great a grace and comeliness, as her actions
were all accompanied with it, that she received by it as much commendation, as
the company delight. The banquet being ended, the dancing began in the same
Hall wherein we were, which was very fair and a large room, where being
seated one next unto another, I told her that although the pleasures which I
received in her company might well be ranked in the first number of those which
gave me greatest reason to acknowledge them, yet I could almost wish that
(never had enjoyed them, by reason of the grief I should receive in departing
from her, and that Fortune shortly would deprive us from ever seeing one
another, it being to be numbered amongst the misfortunes of my life, that heaven
had not ordained that she and I should live in one and the same Country. This I
spoke to make her enter into conference which might serve for the designs of
my Brother; she replied to me, this Country has been sometimes part of
France, and for this cause their pleadings in law are yet in French, and this
natural affection is not departed from the hearts of the most of us, for my
part I have no other desire in my Soul, since I have had the honor to have
seen you; sometimes indeed this Country stood affected to the house of Austria,
but that affection has been torn from us in the deaths of the Count of
Aigmont, of Monsieur de Horn of Monsieur de Montigny and of the other Lords who
were all our near Cosins, that were then defeated, and pertaining to the
Nobility of this Country, we have nothing so odious as the Spanish government,
and desire nothing more, then to be delivered from their tyranny, nevertheless
we know not yet how to effect it, because this Country is divided into
different Religions, but had we been united, we had thrown out the Spanyard
long ago, but this division does render us too feeble for them: I would to God
that your Brother the King of France would be pleased to recover this Country,
which in times precedent was his own, we would lend him all our helping hands;
she spoke not this in an unadvised suddaines but with premeditation to find
from France some remedy for their evils. I seeing the way open to what so much
I did desire, made answer, The King of France my Brother is not disposed to
undertake foreign wars, especially at this present, having in his own
kingdom the factious party of the Huguenots which is grown so strong, that
continually it will hinder him from commencing any wars abroad, but my Brother
Monsieur de Alenson who is nothing inferior in valor, wisdom, and in bounty
to the Kings my Fathers and my Brothers, will readily attend this enterprise,
and will have no less means to bring succor to you, then the King of France
by Brother, he is trained up in war, and esteemed one of the bravest Captains
of this age, and now commands the Kings army against the Huguenots, with
which he has taken since my departure a very strong town called Issoire, and
some others, you cannot seek unto a Prince whose succor shall be more
profitable to you, being so near your neighbor, and having so great a Realm
as France at his devotion, from whence he may bring all the means and
commodities necessary for the war, and if he may receive that good office
from the Count your Husband, you may assure your selves that you shall have
what part in his fortunes that you will defire; my Brother is of a noble
disposition not ungrateful, and who delights in nothing more then in
acknowledging a service or good office done; he does much respect and embrace
Gentlemen of courage and of honor, and is also followed with the bravest of
the nobility of France; I believe they will shortly conclude a peace in France
with the Huguenots, and that at my return I shall see it accomplished; If the
Count your Husband be of the same resolution as you are, and of the same
desire, let him (if he please) acquaint me with it, and I will dispose my
Brother to undertake it, I assure my self that this Country and your house by
it in particular will receive all happiness: And if my Brother should
establish himself here, you may assure your self you shall see me often, our
friendship being such that never any Brother entertained a Sister with more
perfect love: She received this declaration with much content, and told me that
she spoke not this at adventure, but seeing the honor I had done her to affect
her, she was resolved not to leave me, until she had discovered to me the
estate in which her Husband was, and till she had required that some remedy
might be brought from France to release them from the fear in which they
lived, being in perpetual war and danger to stoop to the insolence and
tyranny of Spain; She entreated me that with my consent she might relate unto
her Husband the communication that passed betwixt us, that on the next morning
they both together might talk unto me of it, I very gladly consented to it,
and we passed away that afternoon in such discourses, and in what ever else I
thought might do my Brother service, in which I found that she received great
content.

The dancing being ended, we repaired to hear Vespers among the Canonesses,
which is a Religious order that we have not in France, they are Gentlewomen
which are placed there very young, for the improvement of their marriages,
until they are of age for husbands, they lodge not in common dormitories, but
in several rooms, and in every room there are three or four, or five or six
young Gentlewomen with an old woman, of which old women, there is a certain
and distinct number, who are never married, nor the Abbess of them, they only
wear the habit of Religion in the morning at Mattens, and in the afternoon
at Vespers, and as soon as service is ended, they put off their religious
habit, and apparel themselves as other Gentlewomen that are to marry, going
freely with them to the banquettings and dancing, so that they dress
themselves four times a day, they were every day at the banquet, and daunced
ordinarily after it. The Countess of Lalain thought it long till the evening
was come, to acquaint her husband with the good beginnings which she had given
to these affairs, which having done, in the morning she brought her husband to
me, who made a long discourse of the just occasions which he had to free
himself from the tyranny of the Spaniard, in which he intended not to undertake
any thing against his natural Prince, knowing that the Sovereignty of Flanders
belonged to the King of France, he represented to me what means he had to
establish my Brother in Flanders, having all Hainault at his devotion, which
extended as far as Bruxells, he only was in doubt of Cambresis, which lay
betwixt Flanders and Hainault, and told me it would be expedient for me to
gain Monsieur de Ainsi, to which I replied, that I would beseech him rather
that he would be pleased to speak himself unto him, which he could do more
freely then my self, being both his neighbor and his friend; having then
presented to him what estimation and assurance he might make of the friendship
of my Brother, and that the Fortune he should partake in, should be with as
much greatness and authority as the remarkable service received from a person
of his Quality could merit; we resolved at my return to France, that I should
stay at La fere, whether my Brother should come unto me, and that Monsieur de
Montigny the brother of the said Count of Lalain should come to treat there
with him on those affairs; during the time of my abode there, I did encourage
him always, and fortify him in that resolution, to which his wife brought no
less affection then my self; And the day being come that I must depart from
this goodly company at Monts, it was not without great and reciprocal grief
of all the Flemmish Ladies, and my self, and above all, of the Countess of
Lalain, by reason of the great friendship which she had vowed to me, having
enforced me to promise her, to make my return that way, as I passed into
France. I did give unto her a Carcanet of Jewels, and to her husband a seal
of precious stones, which were esteemed of great value, but far more precious
to them, because they came from the hand of one whom so entirely they affected;
all the Ladies stayed behind, except the Lady of Aurec, who did go with me to
Namur, her husband Monsieur de Aurec, and Monsieur the Duke of Arscot staying
there, ever since the peace betwixt the King of Spain and the States of
Flanders; for though they were both on the States side, the Duke of Arscot was
an ancient Courtier, and one of the most remarkable in King Phillips Court, at
what time he was in Flanders, and in England, and he was always in great
esteem, and next unto the Grandyes of his Court. The Count of Lalain, with all
the Nobility of that Country conducted me above two miles beyond his
government, until he saw the troop of Don John appear, then he took his
leave of me, because he would not see him, only Monsieur de Ainsi did accompany
me, because his master the Bishop of Cambray was of the Spanish faction. That
fair troop being returned, having traveled a little farther, I was
encountered by Don John of Austria, who was attended indeed with many people,
but only with twenty or thirty horse, and with the Lords, the Duke of Arscot,
Monsieur de Aurec, the Marquess of Varambon, and young Balenson, Governor for
the King of Spain in the County of Burgundy, which Noble and gallant
Gentlemen, hearing that I passed that way, were come in a full speed to meet
me: of Don John's own people, there were none of any name or fashion, but one
Lodovick de Gonzagua, who styled himself Cousin to the Duke of Mantua, the rest
were but mean people, and of a servile countenance, there being not any with
him of the nobility of Flanders: He alighted from his horse, and set foot on
ground to salute me in my litter, which was lifted up, and opened round; I
saluted in the French garb, both him, the Duke of Arscot, and Monsieur de
Aurec; after some complements, mounting again his horse, he discoursed with me
till he brought me to the Town, whither we could not come but very late,
because the Ladies at Monts detained us as long as possibly they could,
spending above an hour in the observation of my litter, and taking great
delight to understand the manner, and the devices of it. The method of their
building was so beautiful at Namur, as the Spaniards are excellent that way,
and their Town so lightsome, that the windows and the shops being full of
splendour, one might believe that he saw a new day to shine there. That night
Don John caused me and my train to be served in our own lodgings and chambers,
thinking that after so long a journey, it would be unmannerly to tire us again
with the tediousness of a banquet. The house wherein he lodged me, was well
accomodated to receive me, where they found means to make a great and fair
hall, and an appartement for me of chambers and closets, which were hung round
with the fairest, richest, and bravest movables, that I believe were ever
seen, being all tapistries of Velvet or Satin, embossed with great pillars
made of cloth of silver, inchased with thick knots, and purles of Gold, and
set forth in the richest and most beautiful manner that could be invented, and
in the middle of those pillars were great personages attired after the ancient
fashion, and made of the same imbroidery. Monsieur the Cardinal of Lenoncourt,
who had a curious and a delicate spirit, being a familiar friend of the Duke of
Arscots, who as I have said, was an old Courtier, and a Gentleman of exquisite
indowments, being indeed the only honor of Don John's troop, beholding, one
day while I was there, those gorgeous and magnificent movables, said unto him,
This furniture seems to me to appertain rather to some mighty Monarch then
to a Prince unmarried, and of no greater authority then Don John; the Duke of
Arscot replied, they are the gifts of Fortune, and not of Providence or
abundance, these stuffes being sent unto him from one of the Bashaes of the
Great Turk, whose sons in a memorable battle he took prisoners, and
Signior Don John having done him the courtesy to return them to him without
ransom, the Basha, to requite the good turn, did send him a great quantity
of stuffes of silk, and of cloth of gold, and silver, which were presented to
him, being then at Myllain, a City where is choice of such precious furniture,
of which he made the Tapistrey which you behold, and for an everlasting
remembrance of the glorious achievement of them, he wrought the bed and the
hangings of the Queens chamber in a most rich imbroidery, representing the
glorious victory in that battle, which he gained against the Turks: the
morning being come, we heard Mass after the custom of Spain, which was with
Violins, Cornets, and other music, and departing thence unto the Feast in the
great hall, he and I did dine at a table by our selves, the table where the
Lords and the Ladies dined, was removed some three foot from ours, where Madame
de Aurec had the honor done her for Don John's house, having her drink
presented to her by Lodovick G^nzagua, kneeling. The banquet being ended,
dancing began, which lasted all the afternoon, the evening passed away in this
manner, Don John discoursing always with me, and oftentimes repeating, that he
saw in me a resemblance of the Queen his Mistress, the late Queen of Spain my
Sister, witnessing by all honorable courtesies that could be expressed to me
and my troop, that he received an undissembling joy to see me there. The Boat
on which I was to pass the River Mose unto Liege being not yet in readiness*
I was constrained to tarry there all the next day, where having passed away the
morning as we did the morn before; there was a fair B^are after dinner
prepared for me in which we were ferryed to an Island, being environed in our
way with other Boars full of Hob^yes, Cornets and Viols; Don John had provided
a banquet in the I Will, in a great hall made of gilded Leather, accomodated with
Cabinets round about it, and fille with the music of Hoboyes and other
instruments which continued all supper time. The Banquet being ended, and
dancing having lasted almost an hour, we returned in the same Boat that did
waft us out, and which Don John had prepared for my voyage. The morning
following we departed thence, Don John accompanied me in the Boat, and after a
very honest and courteous farewell, he gave me to Monsieur and Madame de Aurec
to attend me as far as Huy, where that night I was to lodge, which is the first
town that belongs to the Bishop of Liege: Don John being gone forth, Monsieur
de Ainsi who was the last that stayed in the Boat, and who had not permission
to conduct me further, with much grief took his farewell of me, and with many
protestations that he would remain a most constant servant to my Brother and my
self: But false and treacherous fortune not able to support the glory of this
so happy a condition which in my voyage hitherto did attend me, gave me two
cross presa^es, which on my return, to content her envy, she had prepared for
me. The first was, that my Boat had no sooner removed from the shore, but
Madamois^lle de ^^urnon, a virgin endowed with many virtues, whom I entirely
loved, took so strange a sickness, that on a sudden she bur^^ forth into
strong and loud shreiks by reason of the violence of the grief she felt, which
did so oppress her heart that the Physicians could provide no remedy, but
within a few days she was ravished by Death, I will relate this tragical
story in its own place, it being so remarkable. The other was that arriving at
Huy a town situate on the declining of a hill, there brake forth on a sudden,
so impetuous a torrent falling from the Mountain waters into the river, that
engrossing and devouring all at once, we could no sooner leap to land and run
with all the speed we could to recover the top of the Hill, but the flood was
there as soon as we. My lodgeing was on the upper and highest part of the Town,
where that night we were content with what provision the Master of the House
had of his own, who had not means to get Boats or people to send down into the
Town, which seemd overwhelmed in that vast Deluge, from which it was
wonderfully delivered, as it was seized by it, for on the dawning of the day
the waters were all returned, and retired within their proper channels. On my
departure thence Monsieur and Madame de Aurec returned to Namur unto Don John,
and I took Boat to go that day to Liege, where the Bishop who is a great Lord
received me with all the honor and demonstrations of good will that a
courteous and well affected person could express; He was a Lord attented with
great virtue, wisdom, and bounty, and who spoke very good French agreeable
with his person, which was honorable, and magnificen^: He was attended with a
Chapter and many Canons, all sons of Dukes and Counts, and great Lords of
Germany. The Bishopric is of a sovereign estate, and of great revenue, and
filled with many goodly Towns: The Canons obtain their places by election, and
they must continue a year probationers that are received into their Society;
The town is great as Lions, and almost of the same situation (the river Mosa
passing in the middle of it) excellently builded, there being no Religious
House which seems not a fair palace, the streets long and large, enriched
with curious fountains, the Churches adorned with so much marble which they
have there at hand, that worthily they challenge the observation of the
passinger, and may be as well the wonders, as the pleasures of his eye, The
Clockes made with German industry, singing and representing all variety of
Music and of Persons. The Bishop received me as I came out of my Boat, and
conducted me into a fair and stately Palace, so richly painted, and set forth
with so much Gold and Marble, that there is nothing more magnificent or
delightful. The waters of Spa were three or four miles from thence, and there
being no Town near, but a Village only of three or four houses, Madame the
Princess of Roche-sur-yon was advised by her Physicians to stay at Liege, and
to have the water brought thither to her, assuring her that it would loose no
virtue being brought unto her before the Sun was up, of which I was very glad,
having our abode in so fit a place, and in so good a Company; for besides his
Grace* (for so they style the Bishop of Liege, as we give the title of Majesty
to a King, or of Highness to a Prince) the rumor flying that I passed that
way, most of the Lords and Ladies of Almaine were come thither to attend me,
and among others Madame the Countess of Aremberg, who was she that had the
honor to conduct Queen Elizabeth to her marriage at Meziers, when she was
espoused to King Charles my Brother, and who conducted my eldest sister at her
marriage, to the King of Spain; she was a woman that was in great account with
the Empress and Emperor, and with all the Princes of Christendom; there was
also her sister Madame de Lantgrave and her Daughter Madame de Aremberg, and
Monsieur de Aremberg her son a brave and worthy Gentleman, the lively image
of his Father, who bringing heretofore auxiliary Soldiers from Spain to King
Charles my Brother, returned with great honor and reputation. This arrival
being full of joy and honor* had been yet far more delightful, were it not
interrupted by the Death of Madamoselle de Tournon, whose history being so
remarkable, I cannot here but make digression to relate it.

Madame de Tournon who was then my Dame of honor had many daughters, the
^^^est whereof was married to Monsieur ^e B^^anson Governor for the King of
Spain in the County of Burgundy, who returning to his own Country entreated
Madame de Tournon his Mother to let him have another of her Daughters, to
associate his wife being to live now in a place removed from her kindred; her
Mother consented to it, and she staying there some years in improving her
self, though her chiefest beauty was her virtue and her graceful carriage,
Monsieur the Marquis of Varambon (a man designed to the Church being resident
in the same house with his Brother Monsieur de Balanson) by ordinary society of
discourse and conversation with Mademoiselle de Tournon became very amorous of
her, and being not yet obliged to the Church desired to espouse her; he
propounded the motion to his own friends and to hers, they of her side did well
approve it, but his Brother Monsieur de Balanson thinking it more profitable
for him to have him of the Church prevailed so far that he brake off the
Marriage, designing to him the habit and formality of the Gown. Madame de
Tournon offended thereat, took from thence her daughter Mademoiselle de Tournon
with her sister Madame de Balanson, and being a rough and severe woman without
regard of her Daughters age and disposition, which deserved a more gentle
usage, she daily did torment her with vehement and invective language, insomuch
that she was never seen to have her eyes dry, though all her actions were most
commendable, so ungentle was the nature and severi^y of this Mother. Her
Daughter desiring nothing more then to be released from this tyranny
entertained a certain joy when she saw I was going into Flanders, truly
conceiving that the Marquis of Var^b^n would meet me there, and being now in
the estate of Marriage for he had altogether abandoned the gown would
peradventure demand her of her Mother, and that by the means of this Marriage
she should be delivered from her former persecutions. The Marquis of Varambon
and his Brother the younger Balanson did meet us at Namure, the young Balanson
who was nothing so proper a gentleman as the other, did court this maid in the
way of Marriage, and the Marquis of Varambon during our abode at Namure, made
semblance as if till then he had never seen her, at which she put on the
appearance of content, constrayning her self to seem regardlesse of it, but the
trouble, the grief and indignation thereof did so contract her heart, that as
soon as they had taken their last farewell, and were departed from the Boat,
she was struck with such a sudden sorrow that she could not draw her breath
but with many shreikes and mortal pangs; having no other cause of her
sickness, her youth did combat with death, for the space of eight or ten
days, who armed with despite in the end did render himself victorius,
ravishing her from her Mother and my self, who both did bear this loss with
equal grief and passion, for her Mother although she was a very severe woman
did love her most entirely: Her Funerals were commanded to be performed with
all solemnity, because she was descended from a great great and noble family,
and pertained to the Queen my Mother; the day of her interrement being come,
they appointed four of my Gentlemen to bear the Corpse, one whereof was
Boessier, who having in her life time passionately adored her, and not daring
to discover it unto her by reason of the inequality of his birth, and the
virtue which he observed in her, did carry now this mortal burden, and dyed as
often in her death, as the loss of his love had interrupted and divided the
course of his life, breathing out his soul after her in sighs, and every new
minute bringing a new death unto him; this fatal convoy, being in the middle
of the streets, and passing to the Cathedral Church, behold the Marquis of
Var^mbon, who guilty o^ this sad accident, some few days after my departure
from Namur, repenting of his cruelty, and his ancient flame (O wonderful)
being kindled in her absence, which could not be awakened by her presence, he
resolved to come and demand her of her Mother, trusting peradventure in the
good fortune which did attend him, to be beloved of all whomsoever he desired,
as since it has appeared in a Lady of eminent account, whom against her
parents consents he has espoused; and promising to himself, that his Mistress
de Tournon would grant him an easy pardon, repeating these Italian words, che
l^ forza d'amore non risguarda al delitto, did beseech Don John to give him
commission to come unto me, and making diligent haste, he came just, as the
body, as unhappy in her death, as glorious and innocent in her Virginity, was
in the middle of the street, the throng of the people at this pompous
solemnity, did hinder him that he could not pass, he looked about him to
learn what the occasion was, and observed in the middle of the troop, a
multitude of mourners, and a white cloth crowned with Chaplets of flowers, he
asked who it was, some of the City made reply that it was a burial, he grown
more curious, advanced himself amongst the first of the convoy, and with much
importunity desired to know who it was, O deadly answer, the vengeance of love
for his ingratitude and inconstancy, made him now feel those strokes of
death in his soul, which his forgetfulness and disdain had made his
Mistress suffer in her body; the man not knowing who it was that pressed to
know it, told him that it was the body of Mademoiselle de Tournon; at that word
he swounded away, and fell from his horse, they carried him as dead into his
lodging, justly desiring in this extremity to approve that union with her in
his death, which in his life too slowly he accorded to; his Soul, as I believe,
departing into her tomb to crave pardon for what his disdainful oblivion had
committed, did leave his body for a time without any appearance of life, and
returning thence, did animate it anew, to make him feel again the justice of
death, which once alone had not sufficiently punished his Ingratitude.

This sad office being performed, beholding my self in a company of strangers,
I would not afflict them with the grief which I received, for the loss of so
virtuous a servant. I was invited either by the Bishops Grace, or by some of
the Canons to dinner every day in several houses and gardens, as there are
very fair ones in that City. His Grace, with many Lords and Ladies,
strangers, coming every morning to my chamber, accompanied me to the garden
wherein I was to take the waters of Sp^u, which was to be received walking, and
though the Physician that did prescribe it was my Brother, yet it has done me
good, having since continued six or seven years without feeling the swelling
of my arm; departing thence, we never parted company, but resorted to some
feast, and after dancing, to hear Vespers to some religious house, and after
supper we were entertained with dancing again, or else with Music on the
water. Six weeks did pass away themselves on this manner, which is the
ordinary time accustomed for the taking of these waters, and which was
prescribed to Madame the Princess of Roche-sur-yon. As I was preparing to
return to France, behold Madame de Aurec, who going to Lorrayn to seek her
husband, expounded to us the wonderful alteration that happened at Namur, and
in all that Country, since my departure, The same day wherein I departed from
Namur, Don John going out of his boat, and taking horse, under presence of
hunting, came before the gate of the Castle of Namur, the which as yet he had
not mastered, and feigning (as casually he passed by) to go in, and see it in
his way, he seized on it, and slew the Captain whom the States kept there,
breaking the Articles that were agreed on between the States and him, and
moreover he seized on the Duke of Arscots* on Monsieur de Aurecs, and on her
own person, and though after many demonstrations and entreaties, he let her
husband and the Duke depart, yet he retained her till then, (...) be a caution
to him for the deportment of them; She declared that all the Country was now
in arms; there were three parties, the first of the States, which were the
Catholics of Flanders; the other of the Prince of Orange, and the Huguenots,
who made but one Party; and the third of the Spaniards, over whom Don John
commanded. I seeing my self embarked in this manner, that of necessity I must
fall into the hands of the one or the other of them, and my Brother having sent
a Gentleman named Lescar to me, by whom he wrote that since my departure from
France, God had given him the grace to serve the King so well in the charge of
the army committed to him, that he had taken all the Towns which he was
commanded to besiege, and chaced the Huguenots through all the Provinces in
which his army was to march, that he was returned to Poictiers, where during
the siege of Brouage the King continued to be near at hand to succor Monsieur
de Mayenne in what was necessary; that as the Court is a Proteus, that turns
his shape in every hour on the arriving of every new accident, so at his
return he found all things changed, that they made no more account of him, then
if he had done nothing at all for the service of the King, that Bussi, whom the
King seemed to contenance before his departure, and who had served the King in
this war in his own person, and in the person of his friends, having lost
his brother in an assault at the seige of Issoire, was disreguarded also, and
persecuted with envy, as if it had been in the time of Le Guast, that every day
they did procure him some new Indignity or other, that the Kings minions had
practiced with four or five of his chiefest servants, Maugiroa, La Valeit^,
M^uleon, Livarrot and some others to abandon his, and to betake themselves to
the Kings service, that the King ^id much repent him of my voyage into
Flanders, and that I should take heed in my return, for fear of b^ing
surprised, either by the Spaniards, who were advertised of what I treated in
Flanders for him, or for the Huguenots, who would revenge on me the evil^s
which he had done them, having first assisted them, and afterward made war
against them. All this promised, wrought much in my consideration, seeing that
not only of necessity I must pass either amongst the one or the other of
them, but that the Principal of my Company also were affected either to the
Spaniards, or to the Huguenots, Monsieur the Cardinal of Lenoncourt, being
suspected to favor the Huguenots, and Monsieur de Descarts, who was Brother to
the Bishops Grace of Leigh, to be addicted to the Spaniards. In these doubts
full of contrarieties, I knew not to whom to communicate my self, but to
Madame the Princess of Roche-sur-yon, and to Madame de Tournon, who knowing
the danger wherein we were, and finding we had five or six days journey to La
Fere being to pass all the way under the mercy of the one or other of these
two parties, answered me with tears in their eyes, that God alone could
preserve me from that danger, that I should recommend my self to him, and then
do as his inspirations did direct me; As for them, though one of them was
sick, and the other stooped with the weight of Age, they desired me not to
forbear to make long journeys, and that they would endeavor themselves to the
utmost to draw me from this danger. I spoke unto the Bishop of Leigh, who was
indeed a Father to me, and gave me his grand master with horses to conduct me
as far as I would desire, and because it was needful for us to have a
Warrant for free passage from the Prince of Orange, I sent Mondoucet thither,
who was his associate, and rellished something of that Religion; he returned
thence no more, I expected two or three days his coming, and I believe that
should I have waited till he came, I should have stayed there still. I was daily
counseled by Monsieur the Cardinal of Lenoncourt and my chief Esquire
Salviati, who were both of one complexion not to depart without a Pass, and
finding their design did bend another way, I was resolved to go betimes the
morning following, they seeing they could not stay me with this pretext,
Salviati being of intelligence with my Treasurer, who was also a private
Huguenot, exhorted him to say that there was not money left enough to discharge
my expenses, which was extremely false, for being arrived at la Fere, I looked
on the accounts, and there was money enough to defray the charges of at least
six weeks travail more, yet they caused my horses to be stayed, giving this
public affront with great danger to me. Madame the Princess of Roche-sur-yon
being not able to endure this indignity, and seeing the danger wherein I was did
lend me what money I thought necessary, and they remaining confused at it, I
departed thence having made a present to the Bishop of a Diamond worth three
thousand Crowns, and given to all his servants either chains or King of gold,
and I came to Huy having no protection but my hope in God. That Town as I have
said belonged to the Bishop of Liege, but full of tumult and mutiny (as all the
people there knew of the general revolt of the Low Countries) and would no
longer acknowledge the Bishop* because he lived as a newtrall, and they were a
professed party with the States, so that without any respect to the grand
Master of the Bishop of Liege who was with us, hearing how Don John had seized
on the Castle of Namur in my travails that way, as soon as we were lodged,
their drums did beat an Alarm, and they brought their artillery into the
street, and made Barricadoes against my lodging, stretching forth their chains
that we should not come together, and held as all that night in these
perplexities, without having the means to speak to any of them, being all a
silly people, a brutish nation, and without reason; In the morning they
suffered us to go, having filled the streets through which I was to pass with
armed men.

From thence we departed to Di^an, where by misfortune that day they chose
their Burgomasters, who are as Consuls, in Gascogny and France. All that day
was spent in debauchment, all the world was drunk, no knowledge of Magistrates,
but a true Chaos of confusion, and to make our condition yet worse, the grand
Master of the Bishop of Liege had sometimes made war against them, and was
taken by them for their mortal enemy; this town when the people are sober and
in sense, hold for the States, but (...) dominering now amongst them, they
could not hold it for themselves, and indeed neither knew nor acknowledged any
master. As soon as they beheld a troop great as mine to approach their
Suburbs, the alarm grew hot amongst them, they forsook their glasses to run to
arms, and all in a tumult instead of opening the gate they barred it fast
against me. I had sent a Gentleman before with the Harbingers and the Marshall
of my lodging to entreat them to give me passage, but I found them at the gate
crying to those who did not understand them. In the end I stood up in the
Litter, and taking of my Mask, I made a sign to the most apparent of them,
that I would speak unto him, who being come unto me, I intreate^ him to cause
silence to be made, to the end I might be understood, which with much a do
being obtained, I declared to them who I was* and the occasion of my Voyage,
that so far it was from me to bring any hurt unto them by my coming that I
would not give them the least suspicion of it, I entreated them to permit me
and my women only to enter into the Town, with as few of my Men as they
pleased, telling them that I would leave the rest behind me in the Suburbs;
they accepted of this proposition, and I came into the Town with the most
apparent of my troop in which number was the grand Master of the Bishop of
Liege, who by chance was known as I entered into my lodging, environed with
this people drunken and armed, then they began to cry out, that they were
injured, and to charge upon him who was a reverend man of fourscore years of
age, having a white beard down to his girdle. I caused him to make haste into
my lodging against which these drunkards plied their Harquebuses with volleyes
of shot as thick as hail, the walls being made but of earth only. Seeing this
tumult I demanded if the Host of the house were within, by good fortune they
found him, I desired him that he would go unto the window, and make way for me
to speak to the most remarkable of them, which with great difficulty I
procured; he having a long time called to them out of the window, at length the
Burgomasters came to parley with me, but so full of swill, that they knew not
what they said; In the end assuring them, that I knew not that the grand master
was their enemy, demonstrating of what importance it was to offend a person of
my quality, who was a friend to the principal Lords of the States, and that
Monsieur the Count of Lalaine, and all other Chieftaines would give them but
little thanks for this their entertainment of me; having heard the name of
Monsieur the Count of Lalaine, they presently became of another mind, and gave
more respect to him, then to all the Kings to whom I appertained, the most
ancient of them betwixt stammering and laughing, demanded of me, if I was then
a friend to Monsieur the Count of Lalaine; I seeing that his consanguinity
would stand me more in stead then all the Potentates in Christendom, made
answer, yes, I am not only his friend, but his kinswoman also, then they did
reverence to me, and gave me their right hand of friendship, offering as much
courtesy, as before they had committed insolence, and besought me to excuse
them, assuring me that no wrong should be done to that good man the
Grand-master of the Bishop of Liege, and that he should go along with me. The
morning being come, as I was going to hear Mass, the Kings Agent that was
resident with Don John named Du Bois who was a French man extremely
Spaniolized, came unto me, saying, that he had letters and command from the
King to attend and conduct me in my return to France, and for that end he had
entreated Don John to let me have Barlemont with a troop of Horse for my guard
to bring me without danger to Namur, desiring me to speak to those of the Town
to grant entrance to Monsieur Barlemont who was a Lord of that Country, and to
his troop of Horse; This was done for a double end, to make themselves Masters
of the Town, and to make me fall into the hands of the Spaniards. I found my
self here in a great straight, and communing with Monsieur the Cardinal of
Lenoncourt, who had no greater desire then my self to fall into the hands of
the Spaniards, we concluded to know of the Towns men if there were any way by
which we might avoid the troop of Monsieur de Barlemont, and leaving my
little Agent Du Bois to discourse with Monsieur de Lenoncourt, I walked into
another Chamber where I caused those of the Town to come unto me, and declaring
to them that if they gave entrance to the troop of Monsieur de Barlemont they
were all undone, because that he would seize on their town for Don John, I
counseled them to arm themselves, and to stand on their guard, and being
ready at the Gate to show the countenance of men of understanding that would
not be surprised; they did allow and believe my reasons offering to lose their
lives in my service, and gave me a guide to lead me a way where by passing over
the river that ran betwixt the troops of Don John and mine, I should cast them
so far behind, that they could not overtake me, going all the way after by
Towns which held for the States. Having taken this resolution, I sent them to
the Gate, and Monsieur de Barlemont who was already entered did importunately
persuade the Townsmen to permit his troop to come in also. They hearing this,
began all to fall upon him, so that he hardly escaped from being massacred
amongst them, telling him that if his troup did not forthwith retire from the
sight of their Town they would discharge their Artillery upon them, this they
did to give me leisure and the advantage to pass the water, before that troop
could overtake me. Monsieur de Barlemont and the Agent Du Bois did what they
could, to persuade me to go to Namur, where Don John attended me, I made
appearance to do what they desired, and to follow their advice, and having
heard Mass, and made a short dinner, I came out of my lodging, attended with
two or three hundred of the town in arms, and conferring all the way with
Monsieur de Barlemont, and the Agent Du Bois, I took my direct course toward
the mouth of the river, which was contrary to the way unto Namur, where the
troup o^ Mon. de Barlemont expected me: they observing it, told me, that I had
mistook my way, but I beholding them still in discourse, passed on, till I
came unto the gate of the Town, going out of which, and accompanied with a good
number of the towns men, with doubled speed I hasted toward the river, and
taking boat, I caused all the chiefest of my train to enter with me, Monsieur
de Barlemont, and the Agent du Bois crying continually on the Bank-side, that
it was not my nearest way, that it was cross to the Kings intention, who would
have me go by Namur; notwithstanding their outcries, we ferried over the
water with what speed we could, and while they made two or three fares to carry
my litters and horses over, those of the town, on purpose to give me time,
with a thousand outcries and complaints, delayed and amazed Monsieur de
Barlemont, and the Agent du Bois, reasoning with them on the wrongs which Don
John had done them, having falsified his faith with the Estates, and broken the
peace, and arguing with them on ancient quarrels, about the death of Count
Aigmont, and threatening them continually, that if their troop appeared nigh
the Town, they would discharge their Ordnance upon them; this gave me the
leisure to secure my self, being delivered from all fear and danger, by the
guidance of God, and this good man whom they had given to conduct me. I lodged
that night in a strong Castle named Flurines, which belonged to a Gentleman who
held with the Estates, and whom I had seen with the Count of Lalain, but such
was the mischance, that the Gentleman was not within, there being none at home
but his wife only, who seeing us in the Base-Court which lay all open, she
took a sudden fright, and drawing up the bridge, did fly into the Castle,
resolving, say what we could, not to let us in. In the mean while three
hundred Gentlemen, whom Don John had sent to entrap me by the way, knowing that
I went to the Castle of Fleurines to lodge there, did appear upon a little
hill some mile from thence, and believing that we were got into the Castle, for
they might see from thence, that we were all entered into the Court, there made
a stand, and lodged there that night, hoping the next morning to entrap us. As
we were in these perplexities, seeing our selves no farther than in the
Base-court, which was enclosed only with a weak wall, and defended with as bad
a gate, which had been easy to be forced, we continually parlyed and disputed
with the Gentlewoman of the Castle, who was inexorable to our prayers; but it
pleased God, in the duske of the evening to send her husband Monsieur de
Fleurines, who presently received us into his Castle, and was extremely angry
and passionate with his wife for the incivilitie, and indiscretion which she
showed. This Gentleman, Monsieur de Fleurines, was sent on purpose to me from
the Count of Lalaine, to give me a sure convoy through the towns of the
Estates, being not able to accompany me himself, because he could not abandon
the army, being a chief Commander for the States, so happy was this Gentleman's
encounter with me, that conducting me into France, we passed no more by any
Towns, wherein we found not honorable entertainment, because it was the
Country of the Estates, this was the only displeasure which I received, that I
could not pass by Monts, as I promised the Countess of Lalain, our way lying
no nearer to it then Nivelles, which is seven long mile from thence, and I
could not see her husband the Count of Lalaine, because the war growing hot,
he was in the Army of the States, toward Anvers. I wrote unto her only from
thence, on the behalf of the Gentleman that conducted me. She, as soon as she
learned where I was, did send unto me the chiefest of her Gentlemen to conduct
me to the Frontires of France, for I was to pass through all Cambresis, which
was divided one half for the Spaniard, and the other for the States. I
traveled with them to the Castle of Cambresis, from whence they returning, I
sent her in remembrance of me, one of my Gowns, which I heard her very highly
prize when I did wear it at Monts, it was of black Satin, covered with
imbroyderies, which cost me nine hundred crowns. Arriving at the Castle of
Cambresis, I was informed, that certain troops of Huguenots had a design to
attache me between the Frontires of France and Flanders, which I disclosing
but to a few, was ready to depart the next morning an hour before day. Sending
for my litter, my Esquire Sal^iati prolonged the time, as he had done before at
Liege, and perceiving that he did this on purpose, I left my litter, and taking
horse, those that first were ready followed me. I came to Castelet by ten of
the clock in the morning, having by Gods goodness escaped all the wiles and
ambuscadoes of my enemies. I departed thence to my house of La Fere, intending
to continue there, till I heard a peace concluded; I found there a Post of my
Brothers arrived before me, who had a charge to attend my coming, and as soon
as I was arrived, to return in all haste to acquaint him with it. He wrote to
me that the Peace was made, and that the King was returned to Paris, that for
himself, his condition of estate was daily worse then other, there being no
indignity and disgrace, which he and his did not daily prove, and that every
hour brought in new and unjust complaints against Bussi, and the honest
Gentlemen that attended on him, that with extreme impatience he expected my
return to La Fere, intending there to meet me. I suddenly dispatched his
messenger unto him, by whom advertised of my return, he forthwith sent Bussi,
with all his house to Angers, and taking only with him fifteen or twenty of his
servants, he came in Post to La Fere unto me, which was one of the greatest
contentments that ever I received, to have that person with me, whom so
entirely I did affect and honor, and I endeavored my self, to give him all
pleasures which I thought might make that place delightful, which he so well
accepted, that willingly he would have said with Saint Peter, Let us here make
us tabernacles, had not his royal Courage, and the Nobleness of his active
Soul, called him to enterprises of Renown and Glory. The peace and pleasure of
our Court, in comparison of that from whence he came, did render every hour so
delightful, that he could not forbear oftentimes from crying out, O my Queen,
how good it is to be with you; This Court is a Paradise filled with all variety
of delight, and that from whence I came, a hell, pestered with all manner of
torments, and furies.

We stayed there about two months, which in that happy estate, were to us but
two short days, during which time, having made him account, of what I had done
for him in my voyage into Flanders, and certified him in what terms I had left
his affairs, he thought it expedient that Monsieur the Count of Montigny,
brother to the Count of Lalain should come, and resolve him what course he was
best to hold therein, and to take assurances of their good will, and they
reciprocally of his. He came unto my Brother, with four or five of the
chiefest Lords of Hainault, the one whereof had a letter, and command from
Monsieur de Ainsi, to offer his service to my brother, and to assure him of the
Cittadell of Cambray. Monsieur de Montigny promised that his Brother, the Count
of Lalaine, would deliver into his hand all Hainault and Artois, where are many
goodly Towns. These offers and assurances being received, my Brother sent them
back with Presents, which were Medalls of Gold, wherein were his and my figure
stamped, and with reassurances of all additions, and benefits that they could
expect. Returning home, they prepared all things for my Brothers coming, who
making all the* dispatch he could to have his forces ready, returned to Court,
to see what assistance the King would give him to furnish him in this
enterprise, and I desiring to go into Gascogny, having prepared all things for
that effect* returned to Paris, my brother met met on the way, a days journey
from it, and the next day the King, the Queen my Mother, and the Queen Louisa,
with all the Court, did meet me as far as Saint Denis, where I was to dine,
where they received me with great honor, and many welcoms, taking great
delight to hear me recount the honors and magnificence of my voyage, and of
my abode at Liege, and the adventures of my return. In this pleasing
entertainment of discourse, being all in the chariot of the Queen my Mother,
we came to Paris, where having supped, and the Mask ended, the King and Queen
my mother, being both together, I approached to them, and besought them that
they would not think ill of it, if I entreated them that they would be pleased
to grant me leave to go to the King my husband, urging, that the peace being
concluded, my journey could not be suspected by them, and that it would be
prejudicial to my honor, and unbeseeming the duty of a wife, should I stay
any longer from him: they both expressed themselves to like it well, and with
free applause did entertain the motion, and the Queen my Mother told me, that
she would accompany me her self, her voyage being necessary in that Country
for the service of the King, moreover she added, that it was needful that the
King should grant me maintenance for the expenses of my journey, to which the
King did give consent, and I desiring to leave nothing behind which might
cause me to return to Court, being no longer able to take pleasure in it, my
Brother going from it, whom I saw with all speed preparing into Flanders, I
besought my Mother to remember her self in what she promised me at the Peace
concluded with my Brother, and that before I undertook my journey into
Gascogny she would make over the Lands unto me for the assignation of my Dowry:
She acquainted the King with it who found it very reasonable, and promised me
that it should be done; I besought him that it might be done with speed, for I
desired to begin my journey, if he thought good, on the beginning of the month
ensuing: this also was promised, but according to the fashion of the Court, for
instead of dispatching me, though every day I did solicit him, I was deferred
five or six months; and so likewise was my Brother who was as urgent for his
voyage into Flanders, though he represented daily to the King, that it was for
the honor and enlargement of France, that it would prove 'a happy occasion to
hinder the Civil wars, all the moving spirits and desirous of novelty having
the opportunity to go into Flanders, to pass away their discontent and
choler there, and to glut themselves with War, that this enterprise would
serve as sometimes Piedmont did, as a School for the Nobility of France in
their exercise of arms, and there revive the Montlukes, and brave Brissa^s,
the Terms and Bellegards, and such as those great Marshalls were, who trained
up in the Wars of Piedmont, have since so gloriously and successefully served
their King and Country. These demonstrances were fair and true enough, but they
had not so much weight, as to be balanced with the envy which was born to the
enlargement of my Brothers fortunes, to whom every day administered new
occasions of delay, to hinder him from assembling his forces, rai^ing sometimes
on himself, sometimes on Bussi, and his other servants a thousand scandals and
complaints; Bussi being daily inveighed against either by Quelus or Gramont,
who watched by those unjust Alarms to rouse up my Brothers rage to the
overthrowing of his fortunes. All this was done without the knowledge of the
King; but Maugiron who then did most possess him, having forsaken my brothers
service, and believing that he was sensible of it, (as it is ordinary, that he
who offends does never pardon) did prosecute my Brother with so strong a
hate, that he did vow his ruin, and at every word did undervalue and outbrave
him, as the impudency of youth blown up with the Kings favor, did drive him to
all kind of insolence and outrage, and combined himself with Quelus, Saint
Luke, Saint Maigrin, Gramont, Mauleon, Livarrot and other young people whom the
King favored, and these being followed by all the Court, after the fashion of
Courtiers who hunt after favor did practice all things whatsoever came into
their fantasy; In a manner that not a day passed wherein there was not a
quarrel betwixt them and Bussi, who in courage was not inferior unto any. My
Brother considering that this was not the way to advance his voyage into
Flanders, desiring rather to mitigate the King then to exasperate him, and
believing besides that Bussi being abroad might increase the number of his
forces, and provide things necessary for his army; he sent him through his
principalities to give order for it; but Bussi being gone, the persecution of
my Brother ceased not, and then was it understood that although his brave
qualities wrought much jealously in the breast of Maugiron and the rest of these
younkers that were near unto the King, yet the principal cause of their hatred
against Bussi was, that he was my Brothers servant; for after he was gone, they
outbraved and derided my Brother so apparently, and with such despite, that all
the world perceived it, although my Brother was very wise and patient in his
own nature, and was resolved to suffer all things for the dispatch of his
affairs in Flanders, hoping by this means to be quickly gone, and no more to
be found a Subject for them. This persecution howsoever and indignity was very
grievous to him, especially seeing in hate to him, they did daily molest and
wrong his servants, having lately made Monsieur de la Chastre lose a great
suit, because that a little before he became my Brothers servant, the King
being so carried away by the persuasions of Maugiron, and Saint Luke, who were
friends to Madame de Senaire, that he himself did solicit the process for
her against Monsieur de la Chastre, who was then with my Brother, and finding
himself oppressed with the injury thereof, did make my Brother partake of the
just griefs he suffered.

In those days, the Marriage of Saint Luke was solemnized, at which my Brother
(not willing to assist) desired me to be absent also, and the Queen my Mother
who took no pleasure in the boundless arrogance of these young people, fearing
that all that day would be in debauchment and excess, and that my Brother not
being there, they would give a malicious interpretaion of his absence, which
might prove prejudicial to him, procured the Kings good will, that she should
go abroad on the marriage day to dinner at Saint Maurus, and took my Brother
and my self with her: It was on Shro vemunday, on the evening we returned, the
Queen my Mother so prevailed with my Brother, that he consented that night to
be present at the dancing to content the King, but instead of amending his
condition, it did impair it; for Maugiron and his companions being there, they
began to play on my Brother with such keen and pointed language, that a meaner
person then himself would have been offended at it, saying that he had lost
his pains to re-attire himself, that they could not find him after dinner to
say so much as, Much good d'it you, to him, that he came in the hour of
darkness, because it was proper to him, reviling him for the meannesse of his
habit, and for the sickliness of his changed complexion: All this was spoken
to the Bride that sat next unto him; My brother knowing it was done on purpose
to make him answer, and by this means to set him at distance with the King, did
fling away from thence so full of choler and despite, that he could forbear no
longer; but having deliberated with Monsieur de la Chastre, he resolved to
absent himself a while from Court to go unto the Chase, thinking by his
absence to qualify the heat of these young people, and to render his affairs
with the King more easy, for the preparation of his army which was necessary
to go unto Flanders. He addressed himself to the Queen my Mother, who was very
sorry to hear of this difference, and acquainted her with the resolution he had
taken, which she did well approve, and assured him that the King should
condescend unto it, and that she would solicit him in his absence for a
dispatch in what he promised, concerning his enterprise in Flanders; And
Monsieur de Villequier standing by, she commanded him to go unto the King,
and acquaint him with the desire which my brother had to go for a few days a
hunting, which the King allowed, thinking it would be a means to appease the
differences which were betwixt him and the young people Maugiron, Saint Luke,
Quelus, and the rest. My brother retiring into his Chamber holding his suit
granted, commanded all his people to be ready the next morning, to attend him
at Saint Germans, where intending to make his abode for certain days, he gave
order to his chief Hunter to have his Dogs in readiness, and betook himself
to his rest that night, with an intention to rise early the morning following
to go unto the Chase, either to solace his spirits, or a little to divert them
from the noise and tumult of the Court: Monsieur de Villequier repaired to the
King to demand leave of him, to which he did accord, but remaining in his
Cabinet, with the Counsel of Rehoboam, which was five or six young fellows,
they presented to him that this departure of my brothers was much to be
suspected, and put him into such an apprehension, that they made him commit one
of the greatest oversights that this our age did know, which was to take my
brother and his chiefest Servants prisoners, which as it was unwisely
determined, so was it rashly executed; for the King catching hold of these
words, went suddenly in the night, in a great passion to find the Queen my
Mother, as if it were a public alarm, or as the enemy had been at the gate,
and said unto her, Now Madam! what do you think you have done by demanding
leave for my Brother to go, Do not you see the danger in which you put my
estate, without all doubt, under this pretense of hunting, there lies some
dangerous enterprise; I will go seize on him, and all his people, and I will
cause his coffers to be broken open, I assure my self we shall discover
something of importance. He had with him the Captain of the Guard, Monsieur de
Loss, and some of the Scotch regiment. The Queen my mother fearing in this
precipitation, that my Brothers life would be in jeopardie, earnestly desired
that she might go along with him, and because she was all undressed, throwing
her night-gowne on her, she made haste up after him to my Brothers chamber, The
King was knocking furiously at the door, commanding it to be opened,
pronouncing that the King was there: My Brother awaked at this tumult, and
knowing that he had not committed any thing that might give him the least
occasion of fear, he commanded Cange the Groom of his Chamber; to open the
door; the King rushing in, began to tax him, and to tell him that he would
never leave to practice against his State and him, and that he would make him
know what it was to attempt against his Prince: On that, he presently commanded
the Guard to carry forth his coffers, and to take the grooms of his chamber
with them; He searched my Brothers bed himself, and turned and tossed it, to
see if he could find any papers there. My Brother having a letter of Madame de
Sauvaes, which he received that evening, did take it into his hand, that the
King might not see it, the King enforced himself to take it from him, and my
Brother resisting, and with joined hands entreating him that he would be
pleased not to look on it, he made the King more desirous to peruse it,
believing that in that paper he should find a sufficient ground to commence
his process against him. In the end, having opened it in the presence of the
Queen my mother, they were as much abashed at it, as was sometimes Cato, who
in the Senate having constrained Caesar to show the paper that was brought unto
him, importunatly implying that it concerned the benefit of the Commonwealth,
he perceived, that it was a wanton letter of love, directed from his sister to
him. The shame of this event, that came so cross to the expectation of the
King, augmented by despite his choler, so that he gave no ear unto my
brother, who incessantly demanded, of what he was accused, and wherefore he was
so entreated? He was committed to the charge of Monsieur de Loss, and there
was a Guard set over him of the Scotch regiment, with command not to permit him
to talk to any: this was done an hour after midnight; My brother remaining
still in this manner, was in greater perplexity for me, then for himself,
believing truly that they would do the like by me, and that so violent and
unjust a beginning, could not have but as untoward and ending, and seeing that
Monsieur de Loss had tears in his eyes, for grief to see things carried
after this manner, and that by reason of the Guard there present, he durst not
speak freely to him, he only asked him what was become of me, Monsieur de Loss
made answer, that as yet he heard nothing of me; My brother straight replied,
It is a great comfort to me in this affliction, to hear that my Sister is at
liberty, but although she be in that free estate, she affects me so
entirely, that she would rather be in bondage with me, then live in liberty
without me, and desired him to go to the Queen my mother, and beseech her that
she would be pleased to obtain of the King, that I might endure my captivity
with him, this the King did grant; this unshaken belief which my brother had
of the assurance of my love, was such a particular obligation to me, though his
good offices might challenge from me many and great acknowledgements, that I
have ever placed it in the first rank of all; as soon as he had this
permission, which was upon the break of day, he desired Monsieur de Loss, to
send one of the Guard to acquaint me with this melancholy news, and to desire
me to come unto him, the yeoman of the guard, coming into my chamber, found me
asleep, not dreaming of any thing that had passed; he opened my curtain, as I
was opening my eyes, and in a language proper to the Scots, said unto me, Bon
jour Madame! Monsieur your brother desires you, that you would come unto him. I
looked on the Man, being not half awaked, and even ready to fall asleep
again, and knowing him, I demanded of him, if he was not one of the Scottish
guard, he answered, yes; I replied, What is the matter, has my brother no
other messenger then you to send? he answered, No, for all his people are taken
from him, and told me in his language all which that night had happened, and
perceiving I was much afflicted at it, he approached nearer to me, and spoke
that my servants being present, might not hear him, Do not torment your self
Madame, I have a means to save Monsieur your Brother, and assure your self I
will perform it, but of necessity I must then go with him; I answered him,
that he should be rewarded above his hopes, and making haste to dress me, I
went with him alone to my Brothers chamber, In my way I was to go through all
the Court, then full of people, who were accustomed to run to see, and honor
me, but perceiving how Fortune now had changed her countenance, they made as
though they had not seen me; coming into my brothers chamber, I found him with
so great a constancy, that he was not changed at all from his usual
disposition, and tranquillity of Mind, and seeing me, he embraced me, and with a
countenance rather joyful then dejected, said, My Queen, I beseech you forbear
those tears, In this condition that I am, your grief is the only thing that
can afflict me, for my innocence and true intentions do prohibit me to fear
any of the accusations of my enemies, but if unjustly they shall attempt
against my life, they who shall perform it, will be more cruel unto
themselves, then me, who have courage enough to undergo and despise the stroke
of so unjust a death, neither is it that so much which I respect, for my life
has hitherto been accompained with so much sorrow and affliction, that not
knowing any of the pleasures of this world I shall not have the grief to
abandon them, the saddest apprehension which I have is, that wanting a cause to
make me justly to dye, I shall languish in the solitude of tedious
imprisonment, where yet I shall despise the tyranny of my enemies, seeing you
will so much oblige me as to assist me with your presence; these words in stead
of ceasing my tears did so increase them, that out of my eyes I thought I
should have powered all the moisture of my life; I answered him in sobs, that my
life and fortunes were woven into his, that it was in the power of God alone to
hinder me from assisting him in any condition that I could, that should the
King take me thence, and not suffer me to continue with him I would kill my
self in his presence; Passing the day in this discourse, and seeking together
the occasion that made the King proceed in so cruel and unjust a course
against him, and not able to conceive it, the hour came about for the opening
of the Castle gate, where an indiscreet young fellow who was servant to Bussi,
being known and staid by the guard, was demanded by them, whither he was going,
he being amassed with the strangenes of the sudden interrogatory, made answer
that he was going to seek his Master; this being told unto the King, it was
suspected that he was within the Lovure, where coming that after noone from
Saint Germans my brother had caused him to enter in with the rest of the troop
to confer with him on the affairs of his army which was going unto Flanders,
not thinking then he should so suddenly depart from Court as unexpectedly
afterward it came to pass. That evening, on the occasion aforesaid, Archant
the Captain of the Guard received Commandment from the King to look him out,
and to seize on him and Simier; who making this inquisition to his grief,
because he was an intimate friend of Bussies, and by alliance called him Son,
as Bussi called him Father, he came up into Simiers Chamber where he seized on
him, and doubting that Bussi there had hid himself, he made a light search
being glad that he did not find him, but Bussi who lay then on the bed, and
perceived that he should be left alone, fearing that the same Commission should
be given to another with whom he should not be in so much safety, he desired
rather to be under Archants custody, and being of a merry and spiritfull
disposition, in whose breast no danger could work the base effects of fear, as
Archant was going out of the door to lead Simier away, he put out his head
betwixt the Curtains and cried out, why, hoe there! What will you go without me
Father, do not you think my conduct more honorable then such a rakestraws,
as is Simiers; Archant turned to him, and said, Ah my Son, I would to God it
had cost me one of my arms that you were not here; he replied, ^ush, my
affairs go well, playing all the way as he went with Simier, and laughing at
him for the trembling fear wherein he saw him: Archant shut them up both into
one Chamber, and set a guard over them, and went from thence to take Monsieur
de la Castre, whom he carried to the Bastille.

While these things were in the execution, Monsieur de Loss a good old man who
had bin governor to the King my Husband in his nonage, and who tendered me as
his own child, having now the custody of my brother, knowing how unjustly he
was dealt withal, and detesting the bad counsel by which the King was
governed, having a desire to oblige us both, resolved to save my brother, and
the better to discover his intention to me, commanded the Scotch guard to wait
without doors on the stairs head, detaining only two with him, in whose
secrecy he much trusted, and taking me by the hand he said, There is not a true
Frenchman, whose heart bleedeth not to see that which we behold, I have been
too long a servant to the King your Father* to refuse to offer up my life a
sacrifice for his children, I believe that I shall have the guard of Monsieur
your brother, in whatsoever place they will keep him; Assure your self that
with the hazard of my life I will preserve his, but to the end that this
resolution may not be perceived, let us talk no more together, but be certain
of it. This promise gave me a little comfort, and rouzing up my spirit, I told
my brother, that we ought not to be kept in this manner, like people taken by
the Inquisition, without knowing what we had done, that thus they use felons
and the vilest of malefactors when they had taken them prisoners. I entreated
Monsieur de Loss, since the King would not permit that the Queen my Mother
should come unto us, that he would be pleased to let us know by any of his
servants the cause of our restraint: Monsieur de Combaut who was chief of the
Counsel of these young people was sent unto us, who with a gravity that was
natural to him, told us that he was sent thither to know what was that, which
we desired the King should understand; We made answer, that we desired to speak
with any one from the King to know the occasion of our confinement which we our
selves could not conceive: He gravely replied, that we must not demand of Gods
and Kings the reason of their actions, that they did all things for a good and
a just cause; we made answer again, that we were not persons to be held as
those whom they put in the the Inquisition, concerning whom we must divine what
they had done; we could draw nothing else from him, but that he would employ
himself for us, and that he would do us all the best offices which he could:
My Brother began to laugh out right, but I who was turned all into grief to
see my brother in danger, whom I cherished above my own life, had much ado to
forbear from speaking to him, as he deserved.

While he was making this report unto the King, my Mother being in her Chamber,
oppressed with manifold afflictions, and even sick with sorrow, as a wise person
did foresee that this excess made either without reason or subject would bring
a swift and dreadful devastation on the Kingdom, if my Brother had not the
better disposition; and sent for all the old Counselors, Monsieur the
Chancellor, the Princes, Lords, and Marshals of France, who were all
wonderfully offended and scandalized for the bad Council which was given to
the King, saying all to the Qu. my Mother, that she ought to oppose it, and
represent unto the King the wrong which he had done, that they could not hinder
the error from being undone which already was committed, but they ought to
repeal it after the best manner they could. The Queen my Mother with all the
Lords of his Council repaired presently to the King, and did demonstrate to
him of what importance were these effects. The King having his eyes unsealed
from the pernicious Counsel of these young people, did well approve what his
old Lords and Counselors had presented to him, and prayed the Queen my Mother
to repeal it, and to persuade my Brother to forget all that was passed, adding
that he was offended with those young people for it, and desired that by her
means a reconcilement might be made betwixt Bussi and Quelus. This being
determined, the guard was taken off my brother; and the Queen my Mother coming
to his Chamber told him, that he was to thank almighty God for the mercy
vouchsafed him in his deliverance from so great a danger, that she had seen the
hour wherein she could not so much as hope for his life; that since he
understood by this that the King was of such a heady humor that he took
offense not only at effects, but at empty imaginations, and running
uncontrolledly in his opinion, without staying at any advice, would execute
whatsoever his fancy did prompt him to, therefore to put him in no further
grievances, she desired him to put on a resolution to conform himself in all
things to his will, and that he would present himself unto him without any
show of discontent at the unjust proceedings which had passed against his
person; we made answer to her, that we had much to give thanks to God for his
great mercy in securing us from the injustice that was prepared for us, and
that for this, next unto God we owed to her alone our second obligations, but
the quality of my brother did not permit, that they should imprison him without
a cause, and take him then from thence, without any formality of justification,
or satisfaction. The Queen replied that what already had been done God himself
could not cause to be undone, but they would recall the disorder that was made
at his surprisall by making his deliverance with all the honor and
satisfaction that he could desire, that also it were requisite that he again
should content the King in all things, speaking to him with such affection and
respect that the King should remain well pleased with it, and also that he
would be a means that such a reconcilement should be made betwixt Bussi and
Quelus that no more between them an occasion should be found for discontent or
quarrel, avouching that the principal motive which produced all this counsel,
and bad effects, was a fear that they had of the combat which old Bussi (a
worthy father of so brave a Son) had demanded, beseeching the King that he
would permit him to be his son Bussies Second, and in the like manner, that
Monsieur de Que^us might have his father to second him, that they four might
end the quarrel, without troubling the Court, or indangering so many people.
My brother promised that Bussi (seeing he had no hope to redress himself)
should, to come out of prison, perform any thing that she commanded; The Queen
my mother, going down unto the King, found him very willing that this
deliverance should be made with honor, and to this purpose he came into the
Chamber of the Queen my Mother, with all the Princes, the Lords and others of
his Counsel, and sent Monsieur de Villequier to tell us he did attend our
coming. Passing through the halls and chambers, as we were going to his
Majesty, we found them all full of people, who beheld us with tears falling
from their eyes, praising God to see us out of danger. Coming into the chamber
of the Queen my Mother, we found the King with the company before rehearsed,
who seeing my brother, said unto him, that he would desire him not to think
strange, nor be offended at what he had done, being compelled to it by the
zeal which he had to the quiet and safety of the State, that he now believed
that he had no intention to disturb his Kingdom or himself; My brother made
answer, that he had vowed so much service to his Majesty, that he would
think well of whatsoever he was pleased to have done, but he most humbly
besought him to consider, that the devotion and fidelity which he had testified
to his Majesty, did not deserve that rough entreaty, howsoever he accused
nothing but his own unhappiness, and was satisfied enough, if the King
acknowledged his innocence. The King answered yes, there was no question of it
to be made; and entreated him to rely on his love, as much as heretofore. On
this, the Queen my mother joined them hand in hand, and made them embrace each
other. Immediately the King commanded that Bussi should come forth, and be
reconciled to Quelus, and that they should set Simier and Monsieur de la
Chastre at liberty. Bussi coming into the chamber, with that brave presence
which was natural to him, the King told him that he would have an atonement
made between him and Quelus, and that their quarrel should no more be
mentioned, and commanded him to embrace Quelus: Bussi made answer, Sir, if it
be your pleasure that I should kiss him, I am well disposed to it, and
accommodating his gestures to his words, he did accost him with the Pantaloone,
and in a lovers complement did embrace him, at which all the company, though
possessed, and almost astonished with the former passages, could hardly refrain
from laughter: the more advised judged that it was too slight a satisfaction
which my brother received, and not to be parralel'd with so great an Injury.
This being done, the King and Queen my Mother coming to me, told me it was
needful also, that I should give them my hand, that my Brother should not
entertain the remembrance of any thing which might make him start from the
obedience which he owed to the King. I made answer that my brother was so
wise, and had so much devotion to his service, that he had no need to be
persuaded to it, either by me, or by any other, and that he never had, nor
should receive any counsel from me, but what should be conformable to their
will, and his duty. It being then three a clock in the afternone, and none
having dined, the Queen my Mother desired that we might dine altogether, and
afterward commanded my Brother and my self to change our habits, which were
suitable to the sad condition wherein we lately were, and to make our selves
ready to be at supper with the King, and afterward at the dancing. She was
obeyed in those things which could be put off, and left behind; but for the
countenance, which is the lively Image of the Soul, the passion of our just
discontent was read in perfect Characters, and engraven with all the force and
violence of indignation and disdain* as we had true cause to find it in all
the acts of this Tragy comedy; which being ended, Monsieur de Seurre, whom the
Queen my mother had given to my brother to lie in his chamber, and in whose
discourse she often took delight, did chance to stand before her: this was a
man of a disposition bluntly sharp, and who with a careless grace and
affectation, would assume unto himself the liberty of speaking any thing that
came into his head, relishing something of the humor of the Cynick Philosopher.
My mother observing him, said unto him, Now Monsieur de Seurre; And what say
you of all this? he replied, It is too much in earnest, and too little in jest;
and turning to me, he spoke softly, that my mother might not understand him, I
do not believe that this is the last act of the play, the man (speaking of my
Brother) would deceive me much, if he should stay here still. This in this
manner being passed, the malady being healed without, and not within, the young
people who possessed the King, conceiving of my Brothers nature and disposition
by their own, and their unexperienced judgments not permitting them to
discern of what force and virtue was his Countries love unto a Prince so
rarely qualified as was my Brother, they persuaded the King, joining their
cause to his, that my Brother would never forget the public affront which he
received, but would be always watching an occasion to revenge it. The King,
quite forgetting the former error which these young people caused him to
commit* received this second Impression, and commanded the Captain of the
Guards to look carefully to the gates, that my brother might not go forth,
and that every night they should discharge the Loure of all my brothers
servants, leaving only him behind, who usually lay in his chamber, or in his
Waredrope. My brother seeing himself at the mercy of these young heads, who
without either respect or judgment made the King dispose of him as they
pleased, fearing least worse should come unto him, and having a fresh example
of what without any ground or reason lately had befallen him, having three
days entertained the apprehension of this danger, was resolved on the fourth,
to remove from Court, and to retire to his own house, nor return any more to
Court, but with what speed he could, to dispatch his affairs for Flanders; he
disclosed to me this resolution, and perceiving it was his best security, and
that neither the King nor State should receive any prejudice by it, I did
approve it, and contriving the means, because he could not get out of the gates
of the Lou^e, which were so curiously guarded, that steadfastly, and with great
heed they looked in the face of all that passed in and out; I concluded, there
was no other way for him, but to get out at my Chamber window, which looked
down into a deep ditch, and was two stories high; he entreated me to provide
for this purpose, a strong cable, and of a sufficient length, which suddenly I
procured, causing a boy that was faithful to me to carry out that day the cord
of a bed, which was broken, in pretense to have it repaired, and shut again,
and within some few hours after, to bring it back, and with it, the cord that
was necessary for us. The hour of supper being come which was on a fasting
night, when the King supped not, my Mother did sup alone in her little Hall,
and I with her; my Brother although he was exceeding patient and discreet in
all his actions being rouzed up by the remembrance of the affront which he
received, and of the danger which threatened him, impatient to be gone, came
unto me as I rose from table, and whispering in my ear desired me to make
haste, and repair unto my own chamber, where he would attend me: Monsieur de
Matignon who was not yet Marshall, a dangerous and fine Norman who loved not my
Brother, being either adverised of it by some one who peradventure could not
hold his peace, or conjecturing it by the manner which my brother spoke unto
me, said unto the Q. my Mother, as she was going to her Chamber, That without
doubt my brother would be gone, that to morrow he would not be there, that he
knew it very well, and that she should do well to give order to the contrary:
I did even hear the words he spoke, standing very near my Mother, regarding
and curiously observing all that passed, as those do in the like estate, who
being near their utmost danger, or on the point of their delivery, are floting
betwixt fear and hope: I perceived that my Mother was much troubled at the
news which gave me the greater apprehension to believe that we were discovered;
entering into her Closet, she took me aside and said; Have you heard what
Matignon has told me? I made answer, I did not understand it Madame, but I
perceive it is some business that does afflict you; yes, she replied, and that
very much, for you know that I have answered the King that your Brother should
not go, and Matignon now is come to tell me, that he knows he will not be here
to morrow. Finding then my self in these two extremes, either to fail in my
fidelity to my Brother, and put his life in hazard, or to swear against the
truth, a thing which I would not do to escape a thousand deaths, I was in so
great a perplexity that had not God assisted me, my fashion sufficiently had
witnessed without my words, the fear I had that we were discovered, but as God
assisteth good intentions, and his divine bounty joined in this work of my
Brothers safety, I so composed my looks and words, that she perceived not any
thing but that which I would have her, and that I offended not my Soul or
Conscience by any false oath. I demanded of her, if too well she did not
understand the hate which Monsieur Matignon did bear unto my Brother, that he
was a spiteful disturber of all our quiet, and who did grieve to see us live
in concord, that when my Brother did go I would answer it with my life; that I
was confident, he having never concealed any thing from me, that he would have
communicated this design unto me if he had an intention thereunto; this I
said, assuring my self that my Brother being safe they durst not do me wrong,
and choosing rather to engage my life then to offend my soul by any false
oath, or to put my Brothers life in jeopardy; She seeking not after any other
sense of my words, replied; Be well advised what you say, you shall serve as
caution for him, and answer his absence with your life; to which I smiling did
make answer, that it was that which I desired; and bidding her good night, I
forthwith repaired to my Chamber, where putting off my clothes with all
diligence, hasting unto bed, to be the sooner rid of the Ladies and
Gentlewomen that attended on me, I was left only with the women of my Chamber,
when presently my Brother came in, and Simier and Cange with him, and having
commanded them to look first into the ditch, to see if any one were there, we
fastened the cord to the post of the window; we were aided only with my three
women that lay in my Chamber, and with the boy that brought the cord; my
brother, although it was a very great height, without any apprehension of fear
descended first, and laughing at the danger went swinging and playing down;
after him descended Simier in such a pitiful fear that he could scarce hold
the rope for trembling; and last of all Cange the groom of his Chamber. God so
happily did guide my brother from being discovered that he came to Saint
Geneviefue where Bussi did attend him, who by the consent of the Abbey had made
a hole in the Town wall, at which my Brother did go forth, and finding there
two horses ready, he retired to Angers without any misfortune. As Cange last of
all came down, there arose a man from the bottom of the Ditch who began to
run toward the lodgings near the Tenis Court which is the way to the Corpse de
guard; I who in all this adventure apprehended not any thing which concerned my
self in particular, but only the safety or danger of my Brother, stood in a
maze, struck through and through with fear, believing that man to be some one,
who following the advice of Monsieur de Matignon was placed there on purpose to
observe us, and thinking that my Brother had been surprised I fell into a
despair, which cannot be represented but by an essay of things like to it:
being in these perplexities, my women more curious then my self, for my safety
and their own took the cord and put it into the fire, to the end that if the
misfortune were so great that the man who rose out of the ditch, had been set
there to observe us, it might not be discovered; this cord being very long made
so great a flame that it blazed out of the chimney, and was perceived by those
of the Guard, who that night did watch: In a great fright and with loud
importunity they came and knocked at my door desiring that suddenly it might be
opened, then I thought that my brother at that present had been taken, and that
we both had been undone, having notwithstanding anchored my hope on God who
preserved my judgment entire (a grace which his divine Majesty was ever
pleased in all my danger to vouchsafe unto me) and perceiving that the cord was
but half burned out, I spoke unto my women to go gently to the door to
demand what they would have, and to speak softly to them, as if I were
asleep, which they did, and they of the guard told them that a great fire came
out of the tunnell of my chimney and made in the dark of night so bright a
flame, that the danger of it did call them thither to extinguish it: My women
made answer to them, it was nothing, and that they were able to quench it well
enough themselves, and charged them to take heed that they did not waken me, on
which they returned back. This alarm being passed, some two hours after,
behold Monsieur de Loss came to call me to the King and Queen my Mother, to
give them an account of my brothers departure, being advertised of it by the
Abbot of Saint Genevifue, who to avoid all checks, and by my brothers own
consent, when he saw himself far enough from the danger of being intrapped,
came to inform the King of it, telling him that he was surprised in his own
house, and being shut up therein till a breach in the wall was made for my
brothers escape, he could come no sooner to acquaint his Majesty with it; He
found me in my bed, for it was yet night, and I suddenly arising, and putting
on my nightgown, one of my women indiscreetly affrighted at it, took hold of
my gown, weeping and crying out, that I should never return unto them.
Monsieur de Loss beating her back, said, If this woman had done this before
any but my self, who am your devoted servant, these words of hers might
procure great trouble to you, but give thanks to God, and fear not any thing,
for Monsieur your Brother is safe. This assurance of his was to me a needful,
and no less welcome encouragement, to arm me to endure all the threats and
choler of the King, whom I found sitting on the Queen my Mothers bed, in so
great a passion, that I believe I should have found the effects of it, if the
fear of my brothers absence, and my mothers presence had not detained him.
They both said unto me, that I had obliged my self unto them, that my Brother
should not go, and had promised to answer for him; I replied, that it was
true, I had; but in this, that he had deceived me, as well as them, howsoever I
durst assure them on the forfeit of my life, that his departure would bring no
alteration in his service to his Majesty; and that he was only gone to his
own house, to give order in what was necessary for his voyage into Flanders.
This assurance did a little qualify the King, who gave me leave to return unto
my chamber; not long after, there came news from my brother, which gave the
King reassurances of his affection and obedience; this caused the complaint to
cease, but not the discontent, showing in appearance to be willing to assist
him, but traversing under hand the preparations of his Army into Flanders.

The Argument of the Third Book.
HER departure from Court, and travells with the Queen her Mother to the King
of Navarre her Husband. The saucy zeal of Du Pin. The united happiness of
their Majesty's conjugall affections during their five years abode in
Gascogny. The King of Navarre too great with Fosseusa. Foosseusa became too
great by the King, and being burdened by the Queen with it, after an obstinate
denial, she not long after, in safe Childbed was delivered of her burden, and
had she received the Queens saving counsel, she had been delivered with it of
the burden of her fears and shame. New tumults of arms, and war against the
Huguenots, which was silenced by a Peace, concluded by the wisdom of the Duke
of Alenson, and this Queen his Sister. Her preparations into the Court of
France, which being furthered by the spiteful assistance of the King of France
her Brother, began to languish into delays, by the persuasions, and the
reformed love of the King of Navarre her Husbnnd.

The Memorialls of Queen MARGARET. The Third Book.
THE time Passing away it self in this manner, I every hour solicited the
King to grant me leave to go unto the King my husband, who perceiving that he
no longer could deny me, unwilling that I should depart from him unsatisfied,
and infinitely besides desiring to divert me from the friendship of my brother,
he obliged me to stay by all manner of benfits and persuasions, and gave me
according to the promise which the Queen my mother had made at the peace of
Sens, the assignation of my dowry in lands, and besides that, the nomination
and disposure of certain offices and places of preferment; and adding to the
pension which the daughters of France were accustomed to receive, he allowed me
an exhibition from his own coffers, and taking the pains to come and visit me
every morning, he continually represented, how profitable would his friendship
prove unto me, alleging that my Brothers love would in the end procure my
ruin, and that his would possess me with a life as safe as happy, with a
thousand other reasons tending to the same purpose, in which he could never
shake the fidelity which I had vowed to my brother, and could draw nothing from
me but only this, that my greatest desire was to see my brother in his favor,
that it seemed to me that he deserved not to be removed from it, being
confident that he would be most worthy of it by all humility of obedience, and
devoted service: For my self, I acknowledged, I was obliged to him for so much
honor and benefits received, that he might well assure himself, that I would
not fail him in whatsoever commandments he should enjoyne me to perform, and
that I would travel in nothing more, then to preserve the King my Husband in
his loyalty. My brother being then upon his expedition into Flanders, the
Queen my mother desired to go to Alenson, to see him before his departure. I
besought the King that he would be pleased I should accompany her, to take my
farewell of my brother; to this, but to his grief, he gave permission.

Being returned from Alenson, having all things ready for my departure, I did
again beseech the King, that he would give me leave to go, to which he
condiscended; the Queen my mother, who had a voyage also into Gascogny, for the
service of the King (that country having need either of his, or her presence)
resolved that I should not depart without her; and the Court removing from
Paris, the King brought us to his Dolinville, where having entertained us
certain days, we took our leave of him, and a little after, we came into
Guyenne, and traveled through all that Province, before we arrived at the
government of the King my husband. He came to meet my mother as far as La
Reolle, a town which those of the Religion did hold for the mistrust which did
yet possess them, the peace of that country being not fully established: He
was bravely attended with all the Lords and Gentlemen of the Religion of
Gascogny, and with some Catholics. The Queen my mother determined to make but
a short stay, but there intervened so many accidents on the Catholics side,
and on the Huguenots, that she was constrained to make there her abode full 18.
months, and being angry and weary of it, she would oftentimes allege, that it
was done on purpose by them to enjoy the presence of her Gentlewomen; the King
my husband being strongly inamoured on Dayella, and Monsieur de Thurenus on La
Vergna, which was yet no hindrance unto me from receiving all desired love, and
great honor from the King my husband, who from the beginning recounted to me
all the projects and devices which were contrived in the time of his residence
at court, to work his dissension betwixt us, which he acknowledged were made on
purpose to dissolve the friendship betwixt my brother and himself, and to ruin
us all three, and undissemblingly expressed what a full content he did receive,
that we were now together. We remained in this happy condition, during the
time of my mothers abode in Gascogny, who after she had established the peace,
changed the Kings Lieutenant at the entreaty of the King my Husband, removing
Monsieur the Marquis of Villars, and putting in the place of him Monsieur the
Marshall of Biron.

My Mother passing into Languedock, we conducted her as far as
Castlenaudarti, where taking our farewell of her, we returned to the Town of
Pau in Bearne, which having not the exercise of the Catholic Religion, they
only permitted me to have Mass said in a little Chapel, which was but three
or four foot in length, and being very narrow, was full, when but seven or
eight of us were in it. At the hour when Mass was to be said, the draw bridge
of the Castle was lifted up, because the Catholics of the Country who had not
the exercise of their Religion should not hear it, for they were infinitely
desirous to be present at the holy Sacrifice, from which for many years they
were deprived, and being touched with a holy and devout desire, the inhabitants
of that place found a means on the day of Pentecost to come into the Castle,
before the bridge was drawn up, hiding themselves in the Chapel, where they
were not discovered till Mass was almost ended, when the bridge being let down
for so^e of my people to come into the Chapel, certain Huguenots did espy
them, and complained of them to Le Pin, who was Secretary to the King my
Husband, this fellow infinitely did possess his Master, and had great
authority in his Court, and managed all the affairs for those of the Religion:
Imediately he sent some of the guard, who drawing them thence, and beating them
in my presence, did throw them into prison where a long time they stayed, and
paid great fines; I was the more sensible of this indignity, because I
expected no such matter: I complained to the King my Husband, and besought him
that these poor Catholics might be released, who deserved not that
chastisement, and being a long time restrained from the exercise of their
Religion did now assemble themselves on my coming (the better to celebrate the
day of so great a feast) to hear Mass in my Chapel; Le Pin without being
called, did intrude himself, and without giving so much respect to his Master,
as to give him leave to answer, took the word out of his mouth, and told me
that I should not trouble the head of the King my Husband with that matter, for
say I what I would, it never the sooner should be done, adding that they well
deserved the punishment they endured, and for my words they should speed
neither the better nor the worse, that I should content my self that Mass was
permitted to be said for me, and for those my people whom I took with me. These
words did much offend me, from a man of so mean a quality; I besought the King
my Husband if I were so happy to have any part in his affection, that he would
let me understand that he was sensible of the indignity which I received from
that saucy fellow, and that he would compel him to give me satisfaction for
it. The King my Husband perceiving how just my anger and discontent were,
caused him to go out of my presence; telling me that he was very sorry for the
indiscretion of le Pin, and that he should give me what satisfaction I desired;
that concerning the Catholic prisoners he would advise with his Counselors of
the Parliament of Pau, who should do that which might comply with my request.
Having said this unto me, he went into his Closet, where he found Du Pin, who
after he had spoken with him, changed all again; so that fearing I would
request him to dishonor Le Pin out of his service, he shunned my presence, and
dissembling with me deferred what he promised. In the end seeing I grew
resolute, that he should abandon either Le Pin or my self, which of us he
pleased, all those that were present, and who all hated Le Pin, said unto him,
that he ought not to discontent me for so poor a fellow, that had so
arrogantly offended me, that if it should be brought to the ear and knowledge
of the King, and Queen my Mother, they would take it very ill that he still did
entertain him. These words did constrain him to put him away, but he ceased
not to do me evil offices, and to make me false apparences, being persuaded
to it, as he has told me since, by Monsieur de Pibrac who played double with
us, who told me that I ought not to suffer my self to be outbraved by so mean a
fellow as Le Pin, and that whatsoever came of it, very necessary it were, that
I should put him thence; and saying to the King my Husband that there was no
reason nor appearance that he should be deprived of the service of a man that
was so useful to him: Monsieur de Pibrac did this to incite me on the
receiving of so many and great affronts to return into France, where he was
attached in his estate by the President, and one of the Counselors of the
Council of the King: and to make my condition yet worse, Dayella being gone,
the King my Husband courted Rebours who was a malicious wench that loved me
not, and who did me all the bad offices which in her own behalf she could. In
these afflictions having ever my recourse to God, in the end he had pity of my
tears and permitted that we should depart from the little Geneva of Pau, where
as it fell out well for me, Rebourse stayed sick behind, from whom the King my
Husband having removed his eyes, removed also his affection, and began to
imbark himself with Fosseusa who indeed was then a delicate girl, being very
young and very beautiful. As we were in our way to Monta^ban, we passed by a
little Village named Eause, and were no sooner arrived there, but the King my
Husband fell very sick of a violent and malignant fever accompanied with an
extreme pain in his head, which lasted for the space of seventeen days,
during which time he took no rest neither by day nor night, and continually we
were removing him from one bed to another. I rendered my self so servicable to
him, that during his extreamities I never put off my clothes nor departed from
him, insomuch that he began to take delight in my service, and to commend it to
all the world, and especially to my Consin Monsieur -- who performing the
office of a good kinsman reestablished me as deer as ever in the favor of the
King my Husband, a happiness which lasted for the space of four or five
years while I continued in Gascogny with him, making our abode for the most
part at Nerac, where our Court appeared so full of luster, that we envied not
that of France; there was Madame the Princess (...) Navarre, the King my
Husbands Sister, who has since been married to Monsieur the Duke of Bar^ with
my self and a great number of other Ladies and young Gentlewomen, and the King
my husband was attended with a brave troop of Lords and Gentlemen so richly
qualified, that I have not seen more gallant personages in the Court of France,
neither was there any thing in them that was reprovable, but only that they
were Huguenots, but in this diversity of Religion there was heard at all no
noise of controversy, or contention of words. The King my Husband and Madame*
the Princess his sister had recourse in their devotion to the Sermon, and I
with my train to the Mass, which was said in a little Chapel in the Park,
from which when I came forth, we all reunited our selves to walk either in a
very fair garden whose allies on each side were set with Laurel and Cypress
trees, or in the park where were walks of three miles in length, which I had
caused to be made by the Rivers side, and the residue of our time we passed in
all variety of honest pleasures, dancing being usually after dinner, and after
supper. The King courted Fosseusa, who depending altogether on me, maintained
her self with virtue and so much honor, that had she preserved it, she had
not fallen into that misfortune which reflected afterward so much on her, and on
my self: but fortune envious of a life so happy, which was maintained by peace
and union, in which had we continued, we might securely have contemned her
malice, stirred up a new subject of war betwixt the King my Husband and the
Catholics, and wrought the King my Husband, and Monsieur the Marshall of
Biron, who at the Huguenots request had charge of the Kings Lieutenant in
Guyenne, to so great an enmity, that do I what I could to keep the King my
Husband and him at peace, I could not prevail, but they grew into a great
defiance, and hatred one of the other, each of them complaining to the King.
The King my Husband demanded that Monsieur the Marshall of Biron should be
removed from the government of Guyenne, and Monsieur the Marshall taxed my
Husband and those of the pretended reformed Religion to have enterprised many
things against the treaty of the peace. The beginning of this disunion did
daily increase it self to my great grief, being unable to redress it, and
Monsieur the Marshall of Biron persuaded the King to come himself into Guyenne,
alleging that his presence would settle things in a better order, of which the
Huguenots being advertised believed that the King came only to demantle and to
seize upon their Towns which made them resolve to have recourse to arms: this
was that which so much before I feared, and being now embarked to run the
fortune of the King my Husband and by consequence seeing my self to be on a
side contrary to that of my Religion; I spoke to the King my Husband, and to
all those of his Counsel to prevent it, showing how little advantageous to
them this war was like to prove, where they had so great a Chiefetaine to
oppose them, as was Monsieur the Marshall of Biron, a great Captain, and
strongly incensed against them, who would not make a flourish and dally with
them, as others before had done, but should he command the power of the King,
and employ them with a resolution to drive them out of the Kingdom, they were
not able to withstand him. But the fear which they had of the Kings coming
into Guyenne, and their hopes of many enterprises on the greatest part of the
Towns in Gascogny and Languedock prevailed so much, that although the King did
do me the honor to put great trust and confidence in me, and the chief of
the Religion did impute much to my understanding, yet I could not persuade them
to that, which a little after to their expense they found too true. The torrent
uncontrolled must run a while, which shortly after will assuage his course,
when they shall come to the experience of that which I foretold them; but long
before they proceeded to these terms, seeing how the affairs disposed
themselves, I often besought the King and Queen my mother to provide a remedy,
by giving some content to the King my husband, but they made no reckoning of
it, and it seems they were glad that things were brought to such a pass,
being persuaded by the Marshall Biron, that he had found a means to reduce the
Huguenots as low as he desired. This advice of mine being neglected, the
grievances by degrees advanced themselves so far, that in the end they had
their recourse to arms. They of the pretended reformed Religion were much
discontented, because they failed in their forces which they thought to have
assembled, the army of the King my Husband being in number far inferior to
that of the Marshall Biron, especially all their enterprises having miscarried,
unless that only on Cabors, which they took with Petards, with the loss of
many Soldiers, by reason that Monsieur de Vezins was there, who fought with
them for the space of two or three days, and who, with them, street after
street, and house after house did dispute it out unto the last; where the King
my husband made apparent both his wisdom, and his valor, not as a Prince of
his quality, but as a brave and courageous Captain. The taking of this Town
did rather indammage, then advantage them. The Marshall of Biron finding his
opportunity, took to the field, seizing on, and plundering all the little
Towns which held for the Huguenots, and putting all to the edge of the sword.
On the beginning of this war, seeing the honor which the King my husband did
express unto me, commanded me not to abandon him; I resolved with my self to
run his fortune, not without an extreme grief to find the motive of the war
was such, that I could not wish the advantage of the one side, or the other,
without desiring it to my own damage; for if the Huguenots had the better,
that would be the Ruin of the Catholic Religion, the preservation whereof I
preferred to my own life, and if the Catholics should win upon the Huguenots,
I saw the ruin of the King my husband; nevertheless my duty commanding me to
stay with him; and retained by his love, and the confidence which he reposed in
me* I wrote unto the King and Queen my mother of the estate wherein I saw that
Country, to have them advise of those affairs, which I found they did too
much neglect: I besought them, that if in consideration of me, they would not
so much obliege me as to extinguish those flames, in the midst whereof I saw my
self exposed, that at least they would be pleased to command Monsieur the
Marshall of Biron, that the Town wherein I made my abode, should be held in
neutrality, and that within three miles of it there no hostility should be
practiced, and that I should obtain as much of the King my husband, for those
of his Religion. The King did grant me this, provided that the king my husband
should not be in Nerac, but if he were, that then the neutrality should no
longer be in force. This condition was observed on both sides, with as much
respect as could be desired, but it could not withhold the king from coming
often to Nerac, where Madame his sister and my self were resident; it being
his Nature to delight himself in the company of Ladies, and he was at that
time extremely inamoured on Fosseusa, whom he served ever since he forsook
Rebours, and from whom I received no bad office, and for this cause the king my
husband did live with me in as much privacy and familiarity, as heretofore,
seeing that I desired nothing more then his content in all things; These
considerations having brought him one day to Nerac, he stayed there three days
after being unable to depart from a company so delightful to him. The Marshall
of Biron, who watched for such an opportunity, being acquainted with it, made
as though he brought his army that way, to join with Monsieur de Cornusson the
Senescall of Toulouse, on his passage over the river, who brought more forces
to him, and in stead of marching toward the river, he turned upon Nerac, and
about nine of the clock in the morning, he presented himself with all his army
in battle array, within a Canons shot of the town; The King my husband (who
received advertisement the night before of the coming of Cornusson, desiring
to hinder them from joining their armies into one body) determined to fight
with them apart, and was gone that morning on break of day to encounter with
them on the passage over the river; but being deceived in his intelligence, for
Monsieur de Cornusson passed over the river the night before, he returned to
Nerac, and as he entered in at one gate, he understood that the Marshall of
Biron stood in battle array before the other; It was that day very stormy
weather, and there fell so much rain, that the Harquebuses could do no
service. Nevertheless the King my husband cast some of his troops amongst the
Vines, to keep the Marshall of Biron from approaching nearer, having not the
means, by reason of the extreme rain which continued all that day to do any
other fear of war. The Marshall of Biron stood all the while in battle
array before our eyes, and disbanding only three or four of his company, who
demanded in way of turnament to try their lances for the love of the Ladies, he
kept his army entire, covering his artillery till he was ready to discharge,
and on a sudden, making his troops give way, and cleave asunder, he thundered
against the Town with seven or eight volleys of Canon shot, whereof one of the
bullets latched on the Castle, and having made this shot, he marched thence,
sending a Trumpet to me to excuse himself, and to assure me, that had I been
alone, he would not for all the world have attempted it, but I knew, he said,
that it was articled in the neutrality concluded by the King, that if the King
my husband should be at Nerac, the neutrality should then be void, and that he
had commandment from the King, to make war upon the King my husband, in
whatsoever place he found him. In all other actions, Monsieur the Marshall of
Biron had rendered great respect, and expressed himself a friend unto me; for
my letters being fallen in the time of the war into his hands, he sent them
safe, and fast sealed to me, and whosoever spoke on my behalf, received from
him honor and good entreaty. I made reply unto his Trumpet, that I knew indeed
that Monsieur the Marshall had done no more then what pertained to the war,
and to the Kings commandment; but a man of his wisdom might well have
satisfied both the one and the other, without offending his friends, that he
might well have given me leave for those three days to take pleasure in the
contentment I received to see the King my husband at Nerac, that he could not
take him in my presence, but he must seize on me also, that I was highly
offended at what he had done, and would complain unto the King. The war
after this continued a certain time, those of the Religion having always the
worse, which did much assist me to prepare my husband, and dispose him to a
peace. I wrote often to the King and the Queen my mother concerning it, but
they would not understand me, trusting to the good fortune which as yet
accompanied Monsieur the Marshall of Biron.

In the same time that this war began, the Town of Cambray (which since my
departure out of France, was brought under the obedience of my Brother, by the
means of Monsieur de Ainsi, of whom I have spoken heretofore) was besieged by
the Spanish forces, of which my Brother was advertised, being then at his house
at Plossis les Tours, and was newly returned from Flanders, where he had
received the Towns of Montz, Valenciennes, and some others, which were under
the government of the Count of Lalain, who complied with my Brother, causing
him to be acknowledged for their Sovereign in all the Countries of his
authority. My brother defiring to releeve it, had made a sudden press for
Soldiers, intending with all speed to march down with his army to raise the
siege; and because it could not so soon be ready, he put Monsieur Balany into
the Town, to sustain the seige, expecting the coming of the Army to relieve
the Town: As he was on these preparations, and began to draw his forces
together, the war with the Huguenots did interpose it self, which caused him
to disband his troops, to inroll themselves in the army of the King, which was
marching into Gascogny. This took from my brother all the hope to releeve
Cambray, which he could not loose, but he must loose with it not only all the
rest of the Country, which he had conquered, but what most grieved him,
Monsieur de Balany also, and all those good Soldiers which he had put into
Cambray. This displeasure sat deep within him, and being a Prince of great
judgment, and who never failed of expedients in his necessities, he perceived
that the only remedy he had, was to pacify France, and having a courage that
found nothing difficult, he undertook to conclude a peace, and suddenly
dispatched a Gentleman to the King to persuade him to it, and to beseech him to
give him the charge to mediate the peace: this he did, fearing that those to
whom it should have been committed, would be so tedious in the execution of
their charge, that he should loose the means and opportunity to releeve
Cambray, from whence Monsieur Balany, who had already endured the fury of the
siege, sent my Brother word, that he would give him six Months leisure to
bring down his succors, but if at that time the Seige were not raised; the
necessity and want of victuals would be such, that he should not have the
means to restrain the Inhabitants from surrendering the Town. God so blessed
my brother in the design he had to persuade the king unto the peace, that he
gave consent unto it, and was glad that my Brother offered himself to bring it
to effect, hoping by this means to divert him from his enterprise in Flanders,
to which he never was affected: He gave my brother the Commission to treat it,
and conclude it, exhorting my Brother for his assistance in it, to send for the
Lords of Villeroy, and Bellieure: this Commission was wrought so happily by my
brother, that coming into Gascogny (howsoever he stayed seven Months in the
effecting of it, which time seemed to him as long again, because of the
laboring desire which he had to hasten to the succor of Cambray, although the
content which he received that I was with him, did much abate the eagerness of
that care) yet he made a peace to the content of the king and all the
Catholics, leaving the king my husband and the Huguenots no less satisfied,
having proceeded in it with so much wisdom, that he was beloved, and praised
of all, having also in this voyage won the love of that great Captain, the
Marshall of Biron, who did there vow himself his servant, to receive the charge
of his army, which was going into Flanders, whom (to please the King my
husband) my Brother removed from his government of Gascogny, and put in his
place Monsieur the Marshall of Matignon; but before my Brother did depart, he
did desire that accordance might be made betwixt the King my husband, and
Monsieur the Marshall of Biron, who at the first sight made me satisfaction by
an honest excuse, of that which passed at Nerac. I was enjoined to out-brave
him for it with all the sharpest and most disdainful language that I could; but
I used the passionate command of my brother with such discretion, as was
requisite to his affairs, knowing that the day might come wherein he might
much rely on the assistance of so brave a Soldier. My brother returning into
France, attended with Monsieur the Marshall of Biron, rereived no less honor
and just glory for pacifying so great a trouble to the content of all, then in
the many victories he achieved by arms, and made his army more great and
powerful; but what happiness and glory is not attended with envy? The King
taking no pleasure in it, and in the six or seven months time, while my
brother and my self were both together a treating of the peace in Gascogny,
having had the leisure to find an object for his anger, conceived that I had
made that war, and driven the King my husband to it (who well can witness
the contrary) that my Brother might enjoy the honor of making the peace, which
if it had depended on me, it had been done with more speed, and less pains,
for his affairs in Flanders and Cambray, received great disadvantage by this
delay. But alas envy and hate do blind our eyes, and make us not to see
things, as indeed they are. The King building on this false foundation a
mortal hatred against my Brother, and reviving in himself the remembrance of
what was passed, how when he was in Poland, and since his return from thence, I
ever had preferred my Brothers contentment and affairs above his own, joining
altogether at once, did vow my ruin and my Brothers; In which Fortune favored
his resolution, causing in the seven months space that my brother was in
Gascogny, the unhappiness to be such, that he fell in love with Fosseusa, to
whom the King my husband was a servant ever since he forsook Rebours: this
being discovered, the King my husband was offended with me, believing that I
did good offices for my brother, to withdraw the affection of Fosseusa from
him; this I no sooner understood, but I besought so much my Brother in my
behalf, presenting to him what misery might ensue to me by it, that he who
affected my contentment above his own, in this did force his passion, and
spoke no more unto her. Having on this side found redress, Fortune, who when
once she begins to pursue, retireth never at the first counter-blow,
prepared a new attempt more dangerous then the former, causing Fosseusa, who
extremely loved the King my husband, and who till then permitted him no other
privacies, then what the honesty of a familiar love might well enjoy, to take
from him all jealous thoughts which he had of my Brother, and to make him
understand that she did love him alone, did so abandon her self to content him
in all things, that the mischief grew so great, that she was with Child, and
perceiving her self in this estate, she changed all the manner of her
proceedings with me, and in stead of her accustomed method, of being free and
open, and of doing me all the good offices she could, to indeere me the more to
the king my husband, she began now to conceal her self from me, and to render
me as many bad offices, as heretofore she had done me good ones: She possessed
so the king my husband, that in a little time, I found a great alteration; he
estranged, he concealed himself from me, and took not that delight and pleasure
in my company, as he had done for those four or five happy years while we were
in Gascogny, and when Fosseusa governed her self with honor. The peace being
concluded, my Brother returning into France, as I have said, to levy his Army,
the King my husband, and my self returned to Nerac, where as soon as we were
arrived, Fosseusa, either to find a coverture for her great belly, or to
unburden her self of what she had, did put it into the Kings head, to go to
the hot waters that are in Bearn. I besought the King my husband to excuse me,
if I accompanied him not, for he knew that since the indignity I received at
Pau, I had made a vow that I would never return till there they had free
exercise of the Catholic Religion, with great importunity he pressed me to
go, and was very angry at the excuses which I made; In the end he told me,
that his Girl (for so he called Fosseusa) had occasion to take those waters
for the evil of her stomach; I made answer that I was well content that she
should go without me, and that it would make the world think evil of her,
there being no reason for it: In the end I so prevailed, that he was content to
go with her, taking two of her companions, which were Rebours and Villesavin,
with their governesse. They departed thence, and I stayed behind at Baviere: I
had every day intelligence from Rebours, who was she whom the King heretofore
had loved, and who was a corrupt and double-hearted wench, and desired nothing
more then to turn Fosseusa out of favor, hoping to possess again her place
in the affection of the King my husband, that Fosseusa did me all the bad
offices in the world, speaking of me reproachful and disdainful words, and
persuading her self, if she had a Son, and could get clear of me, that she
should be married to the king my husband, who returning from Baveire, was
resolved to go to Pau, and to take me with him, whether I would or no: These
advertisements did much afflict me; nevertheless having my confidence in the
mercy of God, and the goodness of the king my husband, I passed the time of my
abode at Baveire, in expecting him, and in pouring out as many tears, as they
drank drops of water where they were, although the Catholic Nobility of that
Country, with whom I was accompanied, took all the pains they could to make
me forget my afflictions. At the end of five weeeks, the king my husband
returning with Fosseusa, and her other companions, understood by some of the
Lords who were with me, what sorrows I endured, for fear of going unto the
Pau, which was the cause he no more strongly importuned me, but only told me,
he had a desire that I should go, but seeing my tears and words did jointly
witness unto him, that I had rather go unto my grave, he changed his
resolution, and returned to Nerac; where seeing all spoke of Fosseusaes
bigness, and that it was not only all the talk at Court, but in the Country
also, I took upon me to silence the report, and calling her into my closet,
spoke thus unto her: Although some time is passed since you have estranged your
self from me, and I have been induced to believe that you have done me bad
offices to the king my husband, yet the love which I have borne unto you, and
which I have vowed to persons of honor, to whom you appertain, does enjoyne me
to offer you all succor that may releeve you in the mishap whereinto you are
fallen: I must entreat you that you would not be perverse, nor by refusing my
love, to ruin both my honor and your own; I have so much interest in your
reputation, that it is as dear to me as to your self, and believe me, I will
perform the office of a mother to you: Under the pretense of Pestilence, which
you see to be raging in this Country, and especially in this Town, I have the
opportunity to remove to Mas de Agenois, which is a private and retired mansion
of the King my husbands: I will take with me no other train, then whom you
desire. In the mean time the King my husband shall spend his time in hunting,
and shall not stir from thence until you are delivered, and by this means, we
may make the rumor cease which concerns my self as much as you: she in stead
of giving me thanks, with an extreme arrogance replied, that she would make
those know they lied, that reported it, and speaking as loud to me, as I spoke
soft to her, in a great choler she flung away, and sent the King my husband to
me, who was very angry for what I had spoken to Fosseusa, saying that they were
liars all, and that he would prove them so that taxed her: A long time he thus
dissembled it with me, until certain months being expired, the hour of her
delivery was come. Her pangs taking her in the morning about the break of day,
being then in bed, in that chamber* where all the Virgins lay, that attended on
me, she sent for my Physician to come unto her, and desired him to make haste
to acquaint the King my husband with it, which he did; We lay in one chamber,
but in several beds, as our usual manner was, As the Physician told him this,
he found himself in a great perplexity, not knowing what to do, fearing on
the one side that it should be discovered, and on the other side, that she
should be ill at ended, for he loved her entirely. In the end he resolved to
acquaint me with it, knowing that although she highly had trespassed against
me, yet he should find me ready to do him any service he commanded; he opened
my curtain, and said unto me, Sweet heart I have concealed a thing from you,
which is necessary that I now discover; I beseech you to excuse me, and to
remember no more what I have told you on that Subject; only oblige me now so
far, as presently to rise, and make haste unto Fosseusaes succor, who is
very ill, I assure my self, that knowing in what estate she is, you will not
call any thing to mind which heretofore has passed; You know how well I love
her; in this I beseech you to obliege me to you: I replied to him, that I
honored him too much, to take offense at any thing which did proceed from him,
and entreated him that he would be pleased to hunt that day, and take all his
people with him, that it might not be discovered. I caused her presently to be
removed from the chamber of the Maids, and lodged her in a retired room, and
brought with me my Physician, and some trusty women to attend her, where very
safely she was delivered. It pleased God to send her a daughter, which since is
dead* being delivered, we brought her back to the chamber of the Maids, where
though we carried it with all privacy and discretion, we could not hinder the
report from being spread over all the Castle. The King my husband being
returned from hunting, made haste to see her. She desired him that I might come
unto her, as my manner was, to visit all my young women when they were not
well, hoping by this means to stop the busy rumor that ran of her. The
King my husband came forthwith into my chamber, and found me lying on my bed,
being very weary with my early rising, and with the pains I took to assist
Fosseusa in her childing throws, and desired me that I would rise, and go
unto her: I made answer, that when she had need of my help, I was not absent,
but seeing there was nothing to be done, if I should go, I should discover
rather then conceal the business, and that every finger did point at me
already. At this word he grew very angry, and what most did grieve me, me
thought that what I had done that morning did not deserve that recompense.
While thus passed the occurrences of our affairs, the King, who was not
ignorant of any thing that was done in the houses of the Great ones of his
kingdom, and who was precisely curious to know the deportments of our Court,
did cause the Queen my Mother to write unto me, that she had a great desire to
see me, that it was too much for five or six years to be removed from her,
that it was now time to take a journey unto Court, and that it should much
conduce to the affairs of the King my husband, and my own: The King himself
did afterward write unto me to the same effect, and caused fifteen hundred
Crowns to be delivered to me that no inconvenience might delay me, and the
Queen my Mother sent me word, that she would come her self into Xantoigne,
and if the King my husband would accompany me thither, she had some business
there to communicate unto him, and to give him the assurance of the Kings good
will. All these fair apparences could not deceive me in the fruits which were
to be expected from the Court, having had already too much experience of it,
but I resolved to receive some profit by these offers, to advance my own
occasions, and the affairs of the King my husband, hoping also it would prove
a means to divert him from Fosseusaes love, whom I determined to take along
with me, and that the King my husband seeing her no more, might possibly
imbarke himself with some one else that might not prove so cross and spiteful
to me. I had much to do to persuade the King my husband to give consent unto
this journey, because it grieved him to loose the company of Fosseusa, and
because the fame of her late mischance being every where noised abroad, he
jointly began to suffer in his reputation with her. He made me better cheer
then ordinary, and labored very much to take from me the desire of going into
France. But having already made promise by my letters to the King and Queen my
mother, and more especially having received the sum abovesaid for the voyage,
the misfortune which drew me thence, took away with it again the desire which
I had to go, because the King my husband did begin to express more friendship
and affection to me.

FINIS.
Imprimatur,
