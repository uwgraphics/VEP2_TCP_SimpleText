and God of the Spirits of all flesh, by strange Miracles of mercy, through the
preparatory loyal Endeavors of some of your Majesty's most inconsiderable
faithful Subjects, upon the very first Reception and reading of your Majesty's
most gracious Letters and Declarations to the Lords, Commons, City of London,
Army, and Navy, immediately to bow the hearts and spirits of both your Houses
of Parliament, and all your Subjects, (yea of the very Military Officers,
Forces by Land and Sea, formerly raised and engaged against your Majesty's
Cause and Kingship,) as the heart of one man, (as he 2 Samuel 16. 9. to 16.
bowed the hearts of the men of Judah after rebellious usurping Absoloms death,
in the case of exterminated King David) so that they immediately and
unanimously voted your Majesty's speedy return, dispatched their several
Letters, Votes, Messengers, Fleet and Moneys to your Majesty, without one
dissenting voice; to h^sten your Majesty's return, and transport you with
honor and sa^ety, to enjoy your KINGLY AUTHORITY and PATRIMONY, contending
with a most cordial aemulation, who should be first and forwardest, to bring
back and conduct your Majesty (together with your Princely Brothers and
Followers) from your long most deplorable exile, to your Royal City and Palace,
with all possible demonstrations of their public joy, and dutiful Allegiance
to your Majesty, and far greater Magnificence, Solemnity, Triumph, and
multitudes o^ Conductors, than any of your most Victorious Royal Progenitors
enjoyed when they returned into England from their greatest Foreign Conquests.
And that which crowned this Miracle of Mercies, was its celerity and se^son, it
having both its inception and perfection within the limits of one Month, and
its completion on Your Majesty's Birthday (May 29.) whereon, as You were first
born a Prince, You were now re-born A MOST GLORIOUS KING, and most
magnificen^ly invested in the possession of Your Royal Throne at Wh^tehall, in
the presence of all your Majesty's Lords, Commons, and thousands of your People
there assembled, who with their united Shouts, Prayers, P^aises, Acclamations,
Benedictions, and Panegyricks congratulated your Maties Natural and Political
Nativity thereon, both as a Man and Monarch; together with the new Birth and
Resurrection of Your three Uni^ Kingdoms and Churches of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND and
IRELAND, and their respective Dominions, being all ^ised from the^ Graves of
Does and Misery (wherein they had for some years sp^ce b^re been in^red) and
were new ^rn AS KINGDOMS and Churches too on that joy^ d^y, (...) to ^e

Verily, your Majesty with all your Protestant Subjects, after such a

in thy salvation, Honor and Majesty have thou laid upon him. Thou have made him
most Blessed for ever, thou have made him exceeding glad with thy Countenance,
For the King trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he
shall not miscarry. Psalm 106. 48.
Blessed be the Lord God of England from everlasting to everlasting (for th^s
unexpressible mercy) and let all the people say, Amen; Praise ye the Lord. Yea
they all now jointly and severally apply to your Majesty, the blessing and
words of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, after she beheld his transcendent
Wisdom, Virtues, and Magnificence: (which far exceeded the report thereof, as
your Majesty's royal wisdom and graces of all kinds much transcend their fame)
2 Chronicles 9. 5, 6, 7.
Bl^ssed be the Lord thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee upon his
Throne, to be King for the Lord thy God. Because the Lord thy God loved Israel
( England, Scotland and Ireland) TO ESTABLISH THEM FOR EVER, THEREFORE MADE HE
THEE KING OVER THEM TO DO JUSTICE AND JUDGMENT, yea, to restore them to their
pristine Liberty, Peace, Plenty, Traffic, Renown, Prosperity, and make them
the happiest of all Subjects in the world.

In the contempl^tion of which inchoated common Felicity, I humbly presume to
dedicate to your Majesty, this now completed Treatise of, The Signal Loyalty
and Devotion of Gods true Saints and pious Christians in all ages (and lik^wise
of Pagans) to their KINGS, both before and under the Law and Gospel; more
especially within this your first Christian Realm of Britain, (wherein I have
most expa^ted) expressed both by their public and private Prayers,
Supplications, and Intercessions unto God for their long life, health, sa^ety,
victory, prosperity, temporal, spiritual and eternal felicity; and all sorts of
blessings both on their Royal Persons, Queens, P^ogenies, Families, Government,
Kingdoms, Armies, Counsels; by their Thanksgivings to God for their advancement
to their Royal Thrones, Victories, Successes, Deliverances, Piety, Justice and
Gracious reigns over them; by their loyal Acclamations, Salutations, Addresses,
Panegyricks, Epistles to them, and their dutiful Subjection and Obedience under
them, which I have evidenced by presidents and Testimonies in all ages, (never
formerly collected into one Manual) To which I have super added the ancient and
modern Forms of the Coronations of Christian Emperors, Kings, Queens, (and of
some Pagans) with the Ceremonies, Solemnities, Prayers, Collects and
Benedictions used at them, especially those relating to England and Scotland,
(not hitherto published) as a President for, and Prologue to your Majesty's
much desired and shortly-expected Coronation.

The first Part of this Treatise, I lately Printed, in January last, for Your
Majesty's service, to inthrone You in the Hearts, public Prayers and
Supplications of all Your loyal Subjects, to prepare the way for Your Majestyes
speedy Restoration to Your Hereditary Crowns and Kingdoms, which (blessed be
God) you now actually enjoy, to their unspeakable comfort: of the
accomplishment whereof without Arms or Blood, I had such full assurance then
and since in my own apprehensions, from the Observation of Gods admirable
Providence, of Your Majesty's Opposites intolerable Extravagances and
Infatuations, and of Your Subjects late dutiful Inclinations tending thereunto,
through the loyal Endeavor of some Faithful Friends to your Majesty and your
People, that I committed the Second Part of this Treatise, and all that
concerns Your Coronation, to the Press, in the beginning of April last; before
any visible appearances thereof to the eyes or thoughts of others: And I repute
it an extraordinary Blessing and Honor from God and your Majesty, that any of
my Paper Arms and Publications (in your Majesty's and others apprehensions)
have been instrumental to promote this your happy, Unbloody, most joyful
Restitution to your Throne and Kingship, maugre all late Engagements, and Oaths
of Abjuration, to debar your Majesty and all the Royal line for ever from them.

I humbly beseech your Royal Majesty graciously to accept this Unpolished work
(compiled in the midst of many public distracting Employments) being your
Highnesses peculiar by all Rights and Circumstances, as a Public Testimony of
my Loyalty to your Majesty, and a lasting Monument of my Thankfulness to
Almighty God, for hearing my many years constant Prayers, and blessing my
impotent Paper Artillery and endeavors for your Majesty's longdesired, and now
happily accomplished Investiture, not only in your Royal Throne, but likewise
in the Hearts, Consciences, private and public Devotions and Supplications of
all your People. Whom this Treatise, seconded with my Healths Sickness,
(dedicated to your Royal Father many years past) and your Majesty's most Pious
fr^sh Proclamation, will instruct and excite most devoutly to pray for your
Majesty's Health and Happiness in their Churches, Chapels, Families, Closets,
rather than heathenishly to profane, or abuse your Sacred Name, in drinking
your Majesty's Health (to the Hazard of their own and their souls to boot,
through Drunkenness and Intemperance) in Taverns, Alehouses, or at their own
or others Tables, as well to Gods dishonor as your Majesty's.

In fine, I shall be a daily Orator to the God of your Majesty's and your
Kingdoms Salvation, that all the temporal, spiritual, and eternal blessings,
comprised in the several Prayers, Collects, Benedictions, Salutations,
Acclamations, and Passages, collected in this Treatise, for any Christian
Emperors, Kings, and Princes, may concenter in, and be abundantly powered forth
on your Majesty's Royal Person, Family, Kingdoms, Councils, Court, Armies,
Government, People; that so your Majesty may be Chronicled to all Posterity
(as in truth you really demerit) for the best, devoutest, holiest, justest, and
most gracious of all Christian Kings that ever reigned, and your formerly
disloyal, degenerated Subjects, by your most righteous Reign, and pious Regis
ad exemplum to^us componitur orbis^ Claudian.
Royal Example, henceforth become the most Loyal, Religious, Free, and Happiest
of all Subjects in the Universe: Which is and shall be the daily Prayer of

From my Study in Lincolns Inn June 5. 1660. Your Majesty's most humble, yet
Faithful and Loyal Subject William Prynne.

To the Courteous and Ingenuous Reader.
THe Original occasion of the Collections comprised in this Treatise, with the
general causes of its present publication, are at large related in the first
six pages; to which I shall accumulate one special motive (more particularly
reflecting on my self) ne^essitating me thereunto.

It has been my portion (as well as the Sea here, p, 1. 2. and chapter 4.
throughout.
Primitive Christians before me) to be frequently accused, and publicly
slandered, as a professed Enemy to the late Kings Person, to Kingly Government,
and a justifier, an encourager of REGICIDES, and exciter of Subjects, to lay
violent hands upon their Princes sacred persons in some cases.

This calumny was first raised and fixed on me by Dr. Heylin and Bishop Laud,
and by their procurements, inserted into the Information exhibited against me
by M. Noy (then Kings Attorney) in the starchamber, in June 1633. for my
Histriomastix (licensed by Dr. Backner Household Chaplain to Archbishop Abbot)
and endeavored to be proved by some wrested inferences, and expressions of
Fathers, approved Historians quoted by me in that Book, though (b) Histriomap.
825. E. 26. 943. 516. to 520.
I had in express terms therein condemned these disloyal Practices and
Positions they aspersed me withal, as Jesuitical, treasonable and Rebellious;
and disclaimed them in my answer thereunto upon Oath, a^ never once entering
into my loyal heart, being repug^ant to the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance I
had taken (...) has a a Graduate in the University of Oxford, and Barrester in
the Innes of Court; and to the principles of the Sea The Homelies against
Rebellion, and on Whitsunday, Deus and Rex, 3 Jac. c. 1. 4.
Protestant Religion I professed.

After this I was again scandalized and traduced by some of our Prelates to the
late King himself, in the year 1641. out of mere malice, who would needs strain
a passage in my Epistle to the High Court of Parliament prefixed to my
Antipathy, etc. or, Historical Collection of the EXECRABLE TREASONS,
Conspiracies, REBELLIONS, etc. of our English, British, French, Scottish and
Irish Lordly Prelates, against our Kings and Kingdoms, then published, against
the very letter and meaning of my words, and the scope of my whole Book, as the
King himself then answered mine Accusers upon the reading thereof, rejecting
their Accusation as a false and groundless calumny.

Upon the publishing of my Sovereign Power of Parliaments and Kingdoms, in the
year 1643. I was again calumniated in the self same kind, though therein I at
large dicovered, censured the Treachery and disloyalty of Papists to their
Sovereigns, botb in their Doctrines, and Treasonable practices, which they
since would charge me with; whereupon I fully and particularly vindicated my
self from this accusation afresh, in my Mr. Pry^ne the Member reconciled to
Prynne the Barrester, and other Treatises.

Having sufficiently cleared my innocence against all these reiterated
aspersions, coming into the House of Commons, in November, 1648. as a Member,
much against my will, I did then in three several extemporary Speeches in the
House, upon the Armies presenting their treasonable Declaration from Saint
Albans November the 20. demanding the King to be brought to public Justice,
and the Prince and Duke of York to be banished and disinherited, etc. and upon
the Kings seizure by the Army, and removal from the Isle of Wight, to bring him
to his Trial and Execution; declare my judgment at large against these their
Demands and Proceedings, not only as illegal and seditious, but as TREASONABLE
and PERFIDIOUS in the highest degree.

Whereupon on the 4. of December 1648. some implacable Enemies to the King,
endeavoring his destruction (highly incensed against me for my zealous loyalty
to preserve both his Royal Person and Dignity from their intended violence)
falsely and maliciously published and Printed a CHARGE against the King in my
name, purposely to defame me, and stop my mouth from speaking my conscience
freely in the great debate then on foot, touching the satisfactoriness of the
Kings Answer to the Propositions of both Houses, upon the conclusion of the
Personal Treaty with him in the Isle of Wight: which false Imposture I meeting
with that morning going to the House, did there openly complain against it, as
a malicious Forgerie, the very style, frame and expressions in it, evidencing
it to be none of mine. After which I particularly disowned it in the Page 27.
beginning, and refuted the whole scope of it, and the Armies Declaration to
bring the King to Justice, etc. in the end of my Speech that very day Dec. the
4. 1648. as A MERE destructive, JESUITICAL and POPISH DESIGN, by sundry
Arguments from Scripture, Policy and our Laws, the manifold Declarations,
Remonstrances of both Houses, and the Army officers themselves, the Oaths of
Supremacy, Allegiance, Protestation, Vow, Solemn League. Covenan^, and other
Topics: which Speech I soon after published in print at the earnest request of
the Members, secured and secluded with me by the Army, Dec. 6, and 7. for their
Vote touching the Kings Concessions; all the grounds and Reasons of this Vote,
and answers to all objections made against it by the Dissenters from it, during
the whole Debate, being comprised in it. Hereupon this forged Charge was
branded by all sorts for a mere spurious Brat, fit for nothing but the Jakes:
yet notwithstanding one William Sunderson Esquire (a person I never saw nor
injured to my knowledge) has inserted this gross Imposture at large into his
Complete History of the life and Reign of KING CHARLES, from his Cradle Page 116.
to his grave, Printed in London, 1658. reviving its memory afresh, and
fathering it upon me as my genuine Issue, p. 1116, 1117. and that with so much
confidence, and reduplicated Positive, invective asseverations (at least ten
years after its general Disclaimer, as a most false and malicious Forgery) that
some of my friends begin to suspect, and others now believe, report it
generally to be penned and published byme, which all succeeding ages will
undoubtedly credit for truth, if not now afresh disownedby me in Print, and
retracted by this calumniating Historian: Who having read my former disclaimer
and refutation thereof, the very day of its publication in my Printed Speech,
and finding it by the style, texture and close, to be collected by some other
Author, out of my Royal Popish Favorite, and other Books, as he pretends
therein, purposely to traduce me; has discovered his undemerited malice, as
well as his injudiciousness and disingenuity, in fathering that Bastard upon me
in such a confident, scurrilous, invective manner as he has done: for which I
demand public reparations from him, by a Printed Retractation and obliteration
of it, out of his Hist^ry, which it does much disparage, defile and discredit
as well as himself, and the late King, whose life and death he has recorded to
Posterity.

His Readers may observe, that a great part of his History is borrowed from Mr.
Clement Walker his History of Independency; wherein he finds his and my joint
Protestation, under both our hands, then published to the world against the
Kings impeachment and ^ riall; together with the joint Protestation and
disswasion of all the secured and secluded Members against it, in their
Vindication, Jan. 20. 1648. to which I was a subscriber: whereby his malice and
want of ingenuity herein appear most plainly; but more particularly by this,
that himself immediately ^age 1117. 1118.
after this seigned Charge, in the same* page of his History mentions and
misreci^es my MEMENTO, to traduce and abuse me, willingly concealing the Title,
Argument and scope thereof, which would have convicted him both of Calumny, and
Forgery, in fathering this pretended Charge against the King, upon me, and
making me the prime Actor in the Kings Trial and Tragedy, when as the whole
House of Commons and most then living knew, I was the very first of all others,
who sp^ke, writ, and protested publicly against it, as my Printed Speech and
Memento, with other Publications both before and since abundantly evidence.

Let the Title and Argument of my Memento alone, and one Foreiners Testimony of
special Note concerning it (to omit others) display both the malice and falsity
of this Historians calumny. The Title of it is, A brief Memento to the present
Unparliamentary Juncto, touching Their present Intentions and Proceedings to
depose and execute CHARLES STUART their Lawful King. By William Prynne Esquire,
a Member of the House of Commons, and Prisoner under the Armies (...): Jan. 1.
1648. The subject and scope thereof was this, that (being debarred by my
imprisonment under the Army from speaking to those then sitting in the House) I
sent them ten Reasons in Print, drawn from our Laws, the Declarations and
Remonstrances of Parliament, the Oaths of Supremacy, Allegiance, Protestation,
So^emn National League and Covenant, Scriptures, the practice of Gods own
people of Israel, of all Protestant Realms and Subjects; the Relations of the
late King to Scotland, Ireland and Foreign Princes; the unl^wfullnesse,
Treasonableness, and dangerous Consequences of the Kings Trial and Execution,
and other Topics, to dissuade them from their intended Charge and Proceedings
against him, only to satisfy the Army Officers under whose force they sat:
Which to. Reasons, as they were highly approved by most, and never yet answered
by any at home; so they satisfied the Protestant Ministers, Churches and States
abroad, being translated into several Languages. Among others, See my Plea for
the Lords and House of Peers, p. 461. 462.
Samuel Bochartus (one of the eminentest and learnedest Protestant Divines in
France) in his Latin Epistle to Dr. Morley (one of the Kings Chaplains) Printed
Parisiis 1650. sect. 3. De jure and potestate Regum p. 145. having proved the
unlawfulness of the Trial, Proceedings, Sentence and Execution of the King, by
Scripture, Fathers, and other Authorities, and manifested the English
Presbyterian Ministers, and Members professed opposition against and dislike
thereof, subjoins, Ex hoc numero PRYNNIUS, vir multis nominibus insignis and
PARLIAMENTI DELEG ATORUM UNUS, e carcere in quo cum pluribus aliis detenebatur,
Libellum composuit Parliamento oblatum, (to wit my Memento) in quo december
rationibus, eisque validissimis, contendit, eos rem illicitam attentari, (in
impeaching and proceeding capitally against the King) reciting the heads of my
ten Reasons; then concluding, Haec ille, and multo plura: Seriptor mire
nervosus, cujus verba sunt stimuli and clavi in altum defixi: Therefore that
Mr. Saunderson should brand me for my Memento, imprisonment by the Army, and
forcible seclusion from the House, and make it a Divine Judgment inflicted on
me for this forged charge against the King; though this Memento was written
professedly against the Kings charge, trial and Execution, as UNLAWFUL and
UNCRHISTIAN, as Bo^hartus, a Foreiner, thus signally attests, must be the
extremity of malice, and calumny, subjecting him to his own friends, Mr. James
Howels censure, in his Epistle to him prefixed to this H^story, That A FALSE
ERRONEOU^ CHRONOLOGER, is one of the WORST MEMBERS that can be in a
COMMONWEALTH, and INDEED OF MANKIND IN GENERAL; for he wrongs, the time past,
the time present, and the time to come: as he has done, by fathering this
Charge upon me, and his misrelation of my Censure too, p. 218, 219. after it
was nulled by both Houses of Parliaments unanimous Vote, as A new discovery of
^he Prelates tyranny. p. 141. 142. etc.
Causeless and Illegal; All which I pray God to give him grace to repent and
retract.

Having thus vindicated my Innocence from his false calumnies, I shall only
recommend the confideration of the duties pressed in this Treatise, to the
daily practice of every Reader, of what party soever, in these divided factious
times.

Art thou a professed Enemy to the exiled King and Royal Family, conceiving
them to be Enemies or opposites unto thee, thy Interest; or party; or such who
probably may prove enemies or persecutors to thee and them, if restored to
their Rights and Powers: then pray for them under this Notion, according to
Christ's own precepts and example, Mat. 5. 43. to 48. Luke 6. 27. c. 23. 34.
Acts 7. 62. Romans 12. 20, 21. the Presidents of the Primitive Christians here
chapter 4. and ^n the Liturgy of our Church, That it would please thee to forgive
our enemies, persecutors and slanderers, and to turn their hearts. And the
Collect on Saint Stephens d^y, Grant us O Lord, to learn to love our enemies,
by the example of thy Martyr Saint Stephen, who prayed for his Persecutors.
Do thou repute them persons of little or no real affection to the Protestant
Religion, and the sincere Professo^s thereof as ^ Int^rest will not lie.

The Signal Loyalty and Devotion of Gods true Saints and Pious Christians
toward their KINGS, in all ages, and c.
WHat was once the false malicious Calumny, cast by Tertulliani Apologeticus,
c. 30. to 38. Athenagoras Apologia pro Christianis
Pagan Idolaters upon the Primitive Professors of Christianity, living under
persecuting Heathen Emperors, to exasperate their fury against them, as the
worst of Traitors, and public Enemies, unworthy to live within their
Dominions; That they did neither pray, nor offer sacrifices publicly to the
Gods for their health and safety, nor celebrate their solemnities with that
outward pomp and ostentation as others did; is of late years become the just
Accusation, and Treasonable Impeachment of many degenerate Saints, and Apostate
Christians within our Realms: who have not only totally discontinued, but
finally abandoned, prohibited under pain of High Treason, all public (if not
private) Solemn Prayers, Supplications, Intercessions and Thanksgivings, not
for persecuting, Pagan, or Popish Emperors, Princes, but even for their own
undoubted Hereditarie Protestant Kings and their Royal Posterity, in direct
contradiction to Gods own Evangelical precepts, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. Romans 13. 1,
to 9. Mat. 22. 21. Mar. 12. 17. And not only falsified that excellent large
Apology which Tertullian made for the transcendent Loyalty of the Christians in
his age toward their persecuting Pagan Emperors, by their public and private
Zealous Prayers and Petitions to God on their behalfs, and freedom from the
least Conspiracies, rebellions, attempts against their Persons, Crowns or
Dignities, of which none but those who were not Christians, and gave Christians
the name of public Enemies were then guilty; but quite inverted this elegant
passage of his, and translated it both from the Pagan and antichristian Romans,
on those who pretend themselves the most transcendent Christians. see Beatus
Rhenanus, and la Cerda on the place.
Unde Cascii, and Nigri and Albini? Unde qui inter duos lauros obsident
Caesarem? Unde qui faucibus ejus exprimendis palestricam exercent? Unde qui
armati palatium irrumpunt omnibus Stephanis atque Partheniis audaciores? de
Romany ni fallor, id est de non Christianis. Atque adeo omnes illi sub ipsa
usque impietatis eruptione et sacra faciebant pro salute Imperatoris, et genium
ejus deje^abant, alii foris, alii intus. Et utique publicorum hostium nomen
Christianis dabant. Sed et qui nunc scelestarum pa^tium socii aut plausores
quotidie revelantur, post vindemiam parricidarum racematio superstes, quam
recentissimis et ramosissimis laureis posts praestruebant? Quam elatissimis,
and clarissimis lucernis vestibula enubilabant? quam cultissimis et
superbissimis thoris forum sibi dividebant, non ut gaudia publica celebrarent,
sed ut vota propria jam ediscerent, et in aliena solennitate exemplum atque
imaginem spei suae inaugurarent, nomen Principis in cord imitantes etc And
that which is most detestable, the generality both of our people and Ministers
under our Republican Tyrants, have not only wholly laid aside all public and
private Prayers for their own and other Christian Protestant Kings, against
Gods positive precepts, and the practice of Christians, Saints in all former
ages, Churches; but some Ministers in their very Sermons themselves have
(out-of base carnal fear of men, and unchristian compliance with our late
Usurpers) not da^ed to read or mention the word King, or Kings in the very
Texts of Scripture which they have quoted, but skipped over it as dangerous or
superfluous, for fear of incurring the guilt of high treason, or displeasure of
some ^ormidable new Grandees: Whereof I shall relate one memorable instance in
perpetuam rei infamium, the principal occasion of these Collections.

When I was removed by John Bradshaw's and his Whitehall Associates Order from
my close imprisonment at Taunton to Pendennis Castle in Cornwall, without any
cause, examination, hearing, and conducted thitherwards by several Troops, on
the first Lords day in July 1651. resting at Lanceston in Cornwall, I repaired
to the Church there (with 6. Troopers of Major Blackmores troop who conducted
me) in the morning; where the Minister of the Town, A great Republican at
first; afterward a greater Protectorian, christning one of his Sons by the name
of Cromwell Hull.
Mr. Hull, an ancient man (formerly in New England) preaching upon the 1 Pet.
2. 8. A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; handled the Common place of
Scandals, raising this Proposition from the words: That it is the duty of all
Christians to be very careful to avoid scandals. In the prosecution whereof he
prescribed certain rules, how Christians might avoid and prevent scandals: the
first whereof was, cheerfully to submit to all Lawful Powers and Governors
under whom they lived: Particularly prescribed by the Apostle Peter in the 12,
13, 14 verses, which he read thus. Have your conversation honest among the
Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your
good works which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation:
Submit your selves (therefore) to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake;
unto Governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil
doers, and for the praise of them that do well; for so is the will of God; that
with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, etc.
Omitting the very first and principal clause in the Text, which he durst or
would not read: Whether it be to the King, as Supreme; and the disjunctive Or,
( unto Governors:) which not only mangled, but marred the words and sense of
the place. After which he immediately added, that the selfsame rule was
prescribed by the Apostle Paul, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. which he thus read and
maimed as he did the former text. I will therefore that first of all,
supplications, prayers, intercesstons and thanksgivings be made for all men;
skipping over the principal words ( For Kings, and) reading only the next
words, All that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
in all godliness and honesty, for that is good and acceptable in the sight of
God our Savior. Which double omission and preterition of these two chief
clauses in both these quotations one after another, in this very Doctrine, to
avoid scandals, did so much scandalize me, that I presently said to the
Soldiers fitting in the same seat with me; This old temporizing unworthy
Minister in mangling and perverting both these Texts one after another in this
strange manner, by omitting and not reading the principal clauses in them, in
the very Pulpit and presence of God himself, and directions to his Auditors,
has given me greater scandal and juster offense, than any Minister I ever yet
heard preach in all my life, not only by imitating, but exceeding the very
Devil himself when he tempted our Savior: For he when he tempted Christ to
cast himself down from the pinnacle of the Temple: Mat. 4. 6. cited only one
Text to induce him to it, omitting the last words thereof. Ps. 91. 11, 12. For
it is written, he shall give his Angels charge over thee; passing over this
material clause, to keep thee in all thy ways; and reciting only the
subsequent words; and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
thou dash thy foot against a stone. Wherein the Devil acted his own part only
both as a Tempter, Liar, Prevaricator, and that in private. But this old
Minister (if he deserve the Title) alleged two several Texts one after another
publicly to the whole Congregation in the very Pulpit, as the Ambassador of
Christ himself, both which he mangled and prevaricated in the prime Clauses
which he omitted: wherein he neither acted the part, nor discharged the duty of
a faithful Minister, but Devil, or diabolical Prevaricator; fearing, pleasing
those Anti-royallists in present power, and those who could but kill the body,
more than God himself, who could cast his soul and body into hell, and had
under severest penalties enjoined all men, but Ministers more especially, Deuteronomy.
4. 2. etc. 12. 32. not to diminish ought from the word which he has commanded
them: Not to turn from it either to the right hand or to the left, Josh. 1. 7.
For, if any man shall take away from the words of this Book, God shall take
away his part out of the Book of life, and out of the holy City, and from the
things that are written in this Book, Rev. 22. 19. All which texts this
timorous wretched Minister regarded not at all, dreading the Menaces, Commands,
Power of our Republican Grandees, more than the Threats, Precepts, and
Omnipotency of God himself. Whereupon the Soldiers confessed to me, That it was
very ill done of the Minister thus to mangle Scripture, and that they were as
much offended with him for it as my self. Upon further discourse hereof after
Sermon, I told the Troopers, They might now discern the sad effects of
abolishing our Kings and Kingship, and how formidable our new Republican
Grandees who succeeded them, were already become, not only to the Common
people, but also to Ministers of the Gospel, that some at such a great
distance from them as Lanceston, dreaded them more than God himself, and that
in the very Pulpit and House of God, not daring to read the word KING, or
KINGS, in the very Texts they quoted, for fear of incurring High Treason,
against the new more than Kingly Governors, and Legifers at Whitehall and
Westminster; who to prevent this mischief, might do well, to make an Additional
Knack to those Knacks they had formerly published against Kings, and Kingship,
and the Engagement against them, that the words KING and KINGS should be
expunged out of these two Texts of 1 Pet. 2. 13, 17. 1 Timothy 2. 2. and all other
Texts of the Old and New Testament, in all Bibles to be henceforth printed or
read within their New Commonwealth; and all old Bibles prohibited, lest
Ministers or people should incur the guilt of High Treason, by reading, or
obeying these Scriptures to the pr^dice of their Republike: and if others were
afraid to (...) i^, I would in my next Letters to their President John B^dshaw
and his Associates at Whitehall, acquaint them with this passage, and hint thus
much to them. Which I did accordingly when I came to Pendennis Castle.

Upon this and other occasions, I made a Collection of such Scriptures and
Antiquities in all ages, both before, and under the Law and Gospel, as most
clearly evidenced both the practice and duty of the Saints, Churches and People
of God (and of Pagans too) in making public and private prayers for the lives,
healths, Prosperity of their Kings, Emperors, and their royal Posterities,
whether they were Good or Bad, Christian or Pagan, Orthodox or Heterodox,
Protectors or Persecutors of Christianity and the professors of it. Which being
a Subject not particularly treated of at large by any Writers I have seen or
heard of, very seasonable, useful to inform the ignorance, and reform the
neglect thereof in this Apostate age, wherein this Christian duty has been so
long neglected, decryed, prohibited in all our three Kingdoms; I thought it not
only convenient, but necessary to make them public; and communicate them to
posterity, for the glory of God, the Honor of Religion, and the benefit of all
Christian Kings, Emperors, Princes throughout the world.

In the Marshalling of these Collections, I shall observe a mere Chronological
Method, as most useful and perspicuous, digesting all Presidents and Proofs
pertinent to this Subject into distinct Chapters, beginning with those that are
most ancient.

CHAP. I.
THE first Presidents I meet with of Frayers made to God for Kings, are such as
are recorded in Scripture, before the Law was given in Mount Sinai, or any King
instituted by God among his own people of Israel, of which there are 3.
remarkable Instances, seldom taken notice of, which I shall recite, explicate
and apply in order as I find them.

The 1. is that of Abraham, Romans 4. 11, 12, 16, 17.
the Father of all faithful believers, thus registered to posterity, Genesis 20.
Abraham and his wife Sarah sojourning at Gerar, Abimelech KING of Gerar sent
and took Sarah: but God came to him by night in a dream, and said, Thou art but
a dead man, for the woman thou have taken, for she is married to an husband: And
God said unto him in a dream, v. 7. Now therefore restore the man his wife, for
he is a Prophet, and he shall pray for these, and thou shall live: and if thou
restore her not, know thou, that thou shall surely die, thou and all that are
thine. Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called Abraham, and
after some expostulations with him, restored him his wife, and gave him sheep
and oxen, men servants and women servants; profering him to dwell in the land
where he pleased. So Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed Abimelech and his
wife, and his maidservants, and they bare children; for the Lord had fast
closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's
wife, v. 17, 18.

In which History there are 6. observable particulars worthy our consideration:
1. That those who are but mere sojourners under Kings in any part of their
kingdoms, though not their natural born subjects (as Abraham was here at Gerar
under K. Abimelech) See Cooks 7 Rep. Calvin's case, f. 6, 7. 1 Instit. f. 68 b
Spelmanni Glossarium, Tit. Fidelitas, and Ligeantia.
owe local allegiance to them, and are bound to pray unto God for their health,
life, prosperity, especially upon extraordinary occasions, as Abraham did here;
Therefore a multo fortiori, their own natural Subjects and Lieges, are much
more obliged thereunto by the bond of duty, loyalty, and Laws of God and
Nature. 2ly. That Abraham, the Father of all the faithful, is the very first
president recorded in sacred writ, or other History, who prayed for the person
and family of the King under whom he lived and sojourned: that so See Romans 4.
1, 10 25. Heb. 7. 4, 10 10.
his example might be obligatory and presidential to all other faithful people,
servants and saints of God in all ages and places, as well Gentiles as Jews,
who ought to follow his steps herein. 3ly. That he thus prayed for Abimelech
and his family, though (as most conceive) a heathen idolatrous King, and no
worshipper of the true God; as Abraham's words to Abimelech v. 11. ( Because I
thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will stay me for
my wives sake, and Genesis 21. 32, 34.) import. Therefore the Saints and people of
God, ought to pray to God for their Kings and their Families, though Pagans,
Infidels, Papists, Heretics, much more then when they are worshippers,
professors of the true God and Religion; yea Christians and Patrons of the
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 4ly. That Abraham here prayed for Abimelech, his wife,
family, not of his own voluntary accord, but by special direction and command
from God: Therefore prayer for Kings, and their families, is no human,
arbitrary invention, action, which may be omitted or performed at men's
pleasure; but a divine institution, precept, duty, which must be constantly
performed out of conscience, in obedience to Gods command. 5ly. That this
prayer of Abraham was not confined only to King Abimelechs own person, but
extended to his wife, maidservants, and posterity; and was principally, that
God would open their wombs, which he had fast closed, that they might bear
children; which they bare after Abraham prayed for them unto God, v. 17, 18.
that so there might be an hereditary succession of his children after him in
the kingdom. Therefore Subjects (especially in hereditary kingdoms) are obliged
not only to pray for their Kings own persons, but also for their Queens,
families, the multiplication and continuance of their royal posterity, to sway
the scepter, and succeed them in the throne; even by this original president of
Abraham's prayer. Which compared with Abraham's Oath and Covenant to Abimelech,
who swear unto him by God; That he would not lie unto, nor deal falsely with
Abimelech, nor with his Son, nor with his Sons Son; but according to the
kindness he had done unto Abraham, that he should do unto him, and to the land
wherein he had sojourned, Genesis 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 31, 32. is a most pregnant
argument not only of the lawfulness of Subjects Oaths of Fealty, Homage,
Allegiance and Supremacy to their Kings, their heirs and successors, but
likewise of the antiquity, and inviolable obligation of such Oaths, which
ought to be conscienciously observed without lying, falsehood, or the least
violation, by all who swear them, in the sacred name of the true everlasting
God. 6ly. That all Subjects are then most principally obliged to pray for their
Kings and their families, when they lie under any judgments or afflictions of
God for their sins, because then they most need their prayers, as a special
means prescribed by God to remove his judgments, restore his favor, blessings
to them, preserve, lengthen their lives, and make them fruitful in posterity.

The 2. President I shall insist on is this, related Genesis 47. And Joseph
brought in Jacob his Father (after his coming down into Egypt) and set him
before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh, so soon as he came before him:
After some discourse between them, at his departure from him, it is recorded
again: And Joseph blessed Pharaoh (the second time) and went out from before
Pharaoh. Now this his double blessing of Pharaoh, both at his coming in to, and
departing from him, was nothing else, but a double prayer to God to bestow all
kinds of blessings on King Pharaoh, and his posterity; as is evident by Genesis
24. 60. c. 27. 1, to 41. c. 28. 1, 3, 4. c. 48. 8. to the end, and chapter 49. 1,
to 29. compared with this Text.

From whence it is remarkable, 1. That as Abraham the Father of the faithful,
was the first; so Jacob his Grandson, the father of the 12. Patriarks, was the
2d. person recorded in sacred Story, who prayed for and blessed the King in
whose kingdom he resided; whose example is very presidential for all others,
and worthy their imitation. 2ly. That Jacob was no natural born Subject to
Pharaoh, but only a stranger and sojourner in Egypt; yet he thus blessed and
prayed for him: Therefore his and all other Kings genuine Subjects, were much
more obliged by duty and allegiance to pray for and bless them. 3ly. That he
thus prayed for and blessed him twice, at his first access to, and recesse
from his presence; which should instruct all loyal Saints and Christian
Subjects frequently to bless and pray for their Kings and Princes, both in
their accesses to, and recesses from them, and upon all other just occasions,
as well in private a^ public. 4ly. That he thus blessed and prayed for Pharaoh
though a Pagan King, und^ whom and his Successors he and his posterity were
assured, they should be made b^nd-men, and sorely oppr^ssed for 400. years,
till G^d should rescue and bring them out of Egypt by a strong hand, Genesis 15.
13, 14, 15, 16. Exodus 12. 40. 41. Acts 7. 6. 7. To teach us, that all loyal
Subjects, Saints, Christians ought to bless, pray for, not only their godly,
christian, orthodox, Religious Kings, who protect, preserve them in their
Religion, Laws, Liberties; but even for their Pagan, Heretical Kings, and such
who afflict, oppress, persecute them; and not to curse, depose, murder,
destroy, or rebel against them, Mat. 5. 43, 44, 45. Luke 6. 27, 28, 29. c. 23,
24. Acts 8. 60. Romans 13. 1, 2, 3. c. 12. 19, 20, 21. 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. 1 Pet.
2. 18, to 25. contrary to the practice, tenants of the Saints, subjects of this
degenerate, apostate, treacherous, and perfidious age. 5ly. That one part of
Gods and men's blessing of Kings, is, that they may have a numerous, continuing
progeny, permanent House, and royal issue to succeed them in the throne, and
reign over their Nations and Kingdoms, in happiness, peace, safety, prosperity
for many generations, Genesis 17. 5, 6, 7. 16. 2 Samuel 7. 10. to the end 2 Chronicles.
6. 4, to 18. 1 Kings 8. 18, to 27. c. 11. 36, 37, 38. 2 Kings 10. 31. Ps. 132.
11, 12. compared with Psalm. 128. 3 4, 5, 6. Genesis 24. 60. Which no doubt was one
chief part of Jacobs blessing of and prayer for King Pharaoh; being one
principle br^nch of the blessings he bestowed on and wished to his own Sons and
Grandsons, when he blessed them before his death, Genesis 48. 15, 16, 19, ^3. c.
49. 10. 22, 25, 28. Whence it inevitably followe^, that it is the property,
duty of all loyal, pious Saint^, Christians, people, cordially to pray for and
desire God to bless their Kings with a numerous permanent royal issue and
posterity to succeed them in their royal thrones, and reign over them with all
peace, safety, felicity; not to difinherit, banish, abjure, extirpate their
posterities, and deprive them of their hereditary Crowns; which some now deem
their Saintship; piety, honor, felicity to accomplish.

The 3d. are the several prayers and supplications that Moses made for King
Pharaoh, the grand oppre^or, enthraller, afflicter of the Israelites, (when
Exodus 1. 6, to the end. c. 2. 23, 24, 25. c. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. Acts 7. 18, to 35.
God sent him to rescue them from their intolerable bondage under him and his
Officers) to remove those very plagues which God himself inflicted on Pharaoh
and his Egyptians, thereby to deliver them from their vassallage and bring
them out thence to the promised Land: thus recorded by Moses himself, Exodus 8.
8. to 14. When the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt; then Pharaoh
called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the Lord that he may take away
the Frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go, that they
may do sacrifice to the Lord. And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me; against
when shall I entreat for thee and for thy Servants, and for thy People, to
destroy the frogs from thee, and thy houses, that they may remain in the river
only? And he said, to morrow. And Moses said, be it according to thy word, that
thou may know that there is none like unto the Lord our God: and the frogs
shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from
thy people, they shall remain in the River only. And Moses and Aaron went out
from Pharaoh. And Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which he had
brought against Pharaoh: And the Lord did according to the word of Moses, and
the frogs dyed out of the Houses, out of the Villages, and out of the Field, v.
29, 30, 31. Moses entreated the Lord, that the swarms of frogs he sent might
depart from Pharaoh, from his Servants, and from his Pople. And the Lord did
according to the word of Moses, and he removed the frogs at Pharaohs request,
there remained not one. After this Moses entreated the Lord to remove the
mighty Thunder and Hail he had sent, spreadiug abroad his hands unto the Lord
in prayer for that end, and they ceased, Exodus 9. 28, 29, 33. The like he did
at his Entreaty, to remove the plague of Locusts, Exodus 10. 7, 18, 19.

From these Presidents and practice of Moses, I shall deduce these genuine
seasonable Observations. 1. That Exodus 1 8. c. 2. 1, to 16. Act. 7. 20, to 32.
H^. 11 23, 24, 25.
Moses being born in Egypt, and bred ^p in Pharaohs Court, was rather a Native
subject to King Pharaoh, than a mere Sojourner and Foreiner, as Abraham and
Jacob were to Abimelech and Pharaoh; (though he had been absent thence about
forty years;) it thence follows from the premises, That Subjects as well as
Sojourners, are bound by duty and allegiance to pray for their Kings and
people. 2ly. Moses was enforced to Exodus (...). 11, to 16. Acts 7. 24, to 30.
fly out of Egypt to save his life, because Pharaoh sought to (...) him for
killing an Egyptian, who smote and oppr^ an Hebrew, one of his Brethren: and
this Pharaoh to whom God sent him, and for whom he thus prayed four times after
each other, was not only a Pagan-Idolater, but in all probability the Kings
Son, or Grandson, who sought to slay him, Egypt being an her^ditary Kingdom,
as Isay 19. 11. and all Historians record. Yea both these Pharaohs, with two or
more of their Ancestors, and their Officers, did Exodus 1 8, to 22 c. 2. 1, to
23. c 3. 6, to 11. Acts 7. 18, to 35 (...). 105 25.
extraordinarily oppress the Israelites, ca^sing all their Male-children they
could meet with to be drowned in the River, but such as the Midwives preserved
against their commands, afflicting them by their Taskmasters, heavy burdens,
rigor^us service, and hard bondage, which made their lives bitter, and caused
them to sigh, groan, and cry unto the Lord by reason of the bondage, who
thereupon heard their cry, and saw their oppression, and remembered his Covenant
made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to rescue them from their Thraldom. yet
notwithstanding Moses prayed four times to remove the Plagues God had inflicted
on Pharaoh, his Servants and people; and no ways endeavored to deprive, or
disinherit them either of their Lives, Crowns, or Succession, though Numb. 12.
(...). ps. 90. 1. Ps. 106. 23.
a chosen Servant, Man, and Saint of God, Exodus 3, and 4, to (...). 15 Acts 7.
30, to 37. (...). 105. 26, to 30.
commissioned, and sent by God himself to deliver the Israelites from their
bondage under Pharaoh, and bring them out of Egypt. Whence I shall irrefragably
infer, That the eminentest chosen Saints, Men and Servants of God, yea all
other loyal Subjects ought cheerfully to obey and pray for, not only their
Pagan, Idolatrous, but persecuting and oppressing Kings, and their royal
Posterity; and though they may use all lawful means to deliver themselves and
fellowsubjects from their unjust tyranny, bondage, oppressions; yet they
neither lawfully can, nor ought forcibly to dethrone, disinherit them, or their
Posterities of their Crowns, nor rebel against, or deprive them of their lives
by tumultuous Insurrections, Assassinations, and High Courts of Justice.

3ly. That Godly persecuted, oppressed Subjects, may Man. (...). 43, 44, (...)

and ought to pray for the removal of those Judgments which God himself
inflicts upon their oppressive, persecuting Kings, their Servants, People,
successively one after another, for those persecutions, tyrannies, oppressions,
under which they groan and cry, of purpose to bring them to repentance, and
deliver them from their bondage, pressures, vexations under them; as Moses did
in this case of Pharaoh, his Officers and the Egyptians for the removal of 4
grievous Plagues inflicted upon them one after another by God himself, and
Moses and Aaron as his Instruments.

Thus much concerning these most memorable, ancient Presidents, before the Law
and Kings of Israel, which none have hitherto pressed or insisted on in this
kind, to my knowledge, as I have done.

CHAP. II.
I Shall in the next place proceed to Presidents of Gods Servants and people
under the Law, from the first erection of the Israelites into a kingdom, till
our Saviors Nativity, intermixed with some examples of this kind in Pagan
Idolators within that circle of time.

The first Prayer and President of this nature recorded in sacred Story, by
Gods own Spirit, is that which was ^ed at the anointing and inauguration of
Saul, the very first King, * elected, ordained by God himself over his ow^ 1 Samuel 8. 22. c. 9. 16, 17 c 12. 12, 13. c. 15. 1. 19. Jo-s^phus (...) (...) 1.

people of Israel: when Saul being chosen by lot, and fetched from among the
^ff where he had hid himself, 1 Samuel 11. 23, 24. The Prophet Samuel said to all
the people, See ye him whom the Lord has chosen, that there is none like him
among all the people: And all the people thereupon shouted, and said, God save
the King, or Let the King live, as the Hebrew Phrase renders it: which no doubt
they o^t times repeated, according to the usual practice at all Kings
inaugurations and coronations ever since; which probably they ^ned from the
custom of other Nations round about them, who had Kings and kingly Government
before them, as the 1 Samuel 8. 5, 19, 20. Make us a King to judge us like all
the Nations; Nay, but we will have a King over us, that we also may be like all
the Nations; compared with Deuteronomy. 17. 19. And shall say, I will set a King over
me like as all the Nations that are about me; more than intimate. Now these
words, Josephus Antiq Judaic. 1. 6. c. 5. 6.
Vivat Rex, Let the King live, or God save the King,, are not only a most
royal, loyal Salutation and Acclamation of all the People, as directed to King
Saul's person, and inauguration; but a direct Prayer unto God for his long life,
happiness, and prosperous Reign over them as their King, as the words
themselves, and the use of them in succeeding Ages import; compared with Psalm.
72. 15. Ps. 21. 4, 5. Ps. 34. 12. Ps. 61. 6, 7. Genesis 17. 18. Not long after,
when Saul had totally routed Nahash the Ammonite and his great Army, and
rescued Jabesh Gilead from them which they had encamped against, 1 Samuel 11. 11.
thereupon after this Salvation which the Lord had wrought by him for Israel, v.
14, 15. Samuel said to the pecple, Come and let us go up to Gilgal and renew
the kingdom there: and all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul
King before the Lord: and there they sacrificed Sacrifices of Peace Offerings
before the Lord, and there Saul and the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. Which
words imply, that both Samuel and the people by making Saul King the second
time before the Lord, and offering PeaceOff^rings offering, and rejoicing
greatly before the Lord, did make special Prayers and Thanksgivings unto God
for his life, prosperity, and victorious success over his and their Enemies,
according to the subsequent Gospel-text grounded on this Pre^dent, 1 Timothy 2. 1,
2. And Samuels subsequent words to the people at this meeting, chapter 12. 13, 14,
23, 25. Now therefore behold the King whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have
desired, and behold the Lord has set a King over you: if you will fear the
Lord, and serve him, and obey his Voice, and not rebel against the Commandment
of the Lord, then shall both ye, and also the King that reigns over you,
continue following the Lord your God; But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye
shall be destroyed, both you and your King. Moreover as for me, God forbid that
I should sin against the Lord, in ceasing to pray for you: compared with the 1 Samuel 15. 35. where it is recorded, that after Gods rejection of Saul, and
repenting he had made him King, for disobeying his command in sparing Agag, and
the best of the Amalekites spoils; Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, and
chapter 16. v. 1. And the Lord said to Samuel, How long will thou mourn for Saul,
seeing I have rejected him from being King over Israel? All these do clearly
evidence, that Samuel the Prophet, and no doubt all other his loyal pious
Subjects, Priests and Levites did constantly make Prayers, Supplications, and
Intercessions to God for Saul, and bewail and moan for his Sins, even after God
had rejected him, much more then did they perform this Duty before Gods
rejection during all his Reign, as well as at his inauguration.

The next King over Gods people by divine election and designation was David,
in whose House, Seed, and Royal Progeny God established the hereditary
succession of the Crown and kingdom, both by his Promise, Covenant and Oath, 2 Samuel 7. 10, to the end. 1 Chronicles. 28. 4, to 10. 1 Kings 18. 25, 26. 2 Chronicles. 7.
17, 8. c. 23. 3. Ps. 89. 3, 4, 28, 29. Ps. 132. 11, 12, 13, 14. Jer. 33. 20,
21. What particular Prayers and Acclamations were made at his Instalment in the
Royal Throne over the Tribes of Israel, I find not recorded in Scripture or
Josephus: only I read in general, 2 Samuel 5. 3. All the Tribes of Israel came to
David to Hebron, and King David made a League with them in Hebron before the
Lord, and they anointed David King over Israel; no doubt with many Prayers to
God for his life and prosperous Reign, and reiterated shouts, Let the King
live, as at Saul's precedent, and Solomon's and other kings subsequent
inaugurations, though omitted for brevity in sacred History. During David's
Reign, I shall observe several particulars pertinent to my purpose.

1. David's Soul-ravishing Prayer and Thanksgiving made to God himself upon Gods
message, and promise to him by Nathan the Prophet, to set up his Seed after
him, and to establish his House, Kingdom, and Throne for ever, recorded at
large, 2 Samuel 7. In which Prayer David used these expressions amongst other, v.
25. etc. And now O Lord God, the word that thou have spoken concerning thy
Servant, and concerning his House, establish it for ever, and do as thou have
said: And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of Hosts is the
God over Israel, and let the House of thy Servant David be established before
thee, etc. And now O Lord God thou art that God, and thy words be true, and
thou have promised this goodness unto thy Servant; therefore now let it please
thee to bless the House of thy Servant, that it may continue for ever before
thee; for thou O Lord have spoken it, and with thy Blessing let the House of
thy Servant be blessed for ever. Here we have David the first hereditary king
over Gods people, upon the first tidings of Gods promise to settle the
Inheritance and Succession of the kingdom of Israel in his House and seed for
ever; making a most zealous, fervent pathetical Thanksgiving and Prayer to God
for the accomplishmeut of this promise, in establishing and blessing his House
for ever. Which being afterward put in writing, and particularly recorded in
sacred Story, no doubt was constantly used both in private and public by
himself, and all his loyal devout Subjects, whether Priests. Levites, or people
all his Reign, and registered as a sacred President for all hereditary pious
Kings and Subjects future imitation.

2ly. David's public Prayers, Psalms, and Thanksgivings to God for himself as
King, and for his Royal Son and his Posterity that should succeed him in the
Throne, recorded in sacred writ, prescribed to the Church and people of God
during his Reign, and succeeding Ages, and constantly used by them, and all
Churches of God to this very day, at the inauguration of their Kings, and upon
other royal Solemnities, Victories, Triumphs and Installments, or marriages of
their Sons and heirs to the Crown. I shall instance only in Psalm: 18. I will
love thee, O Lord my strength, etc. Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O
Lord, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name; Great deliverance
gives he to his King, and shows mercy to his anointed, to David and to his
seed for evermore, Psalm. 21. The King shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in
thy Salvatian how greatly shall he rejoice! For thou have given him his hearts
desire, thou have not withholden the request of his lips: for thou preventest
him with the blessings of goodness, thou set a Crown of pure gold on his
head. He asked life of thee, and thou gave it him, even length of days for
ever and ever, his glory is great in thy salvation, glory and majesty have thou
laid upon him; for thou have made him most blessed for ever, etc. Which Psalm,
though it be mystically applied to Christ the King of his Church and Saints by
Basil, Augustine, Arnobius, Mercer, and others.
many, yet doubtless it was literally meant of King David himself who compiled
it. Psalm. 45. My heart is indicting a good matter, I will speak of the things
which I have made touching the King: literally intended of Solomon, but
mystically of Christ his kingdom and Church. Psalm. 61. Hear my cry, O God,
attend unto my Prayer, etc. Thou will prolong the Kings life, and his years as
many generations; He shall abide before God for ever, O prepare mercy and truth
which may preserve him. Psalm. 72. 1, 2, etc. Give the King thy Judgments, O
God, and thy Righteousness unto the Kings Son; Then shall he judge thy people
with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment, etc. He shall save the souls
of the needy: He shall redeem their Soul from deceit and violence, and precious
shall their blood be in his sight: He shall live, and unto him shall be given
of the Gold of Sheba, Praye^ also shall be made for him continually, and daily
shall he be praised. Which Psalm, though mystically meant of Jesus Christ the
Son of David, as all accord; yet it was first literally made, used in and by
the Church and people of God, and prescribed to them as a public Prayer for
King David and his Son Solomon, who was to succeed him in the throne; as most
accord, and the Contents in our Bibles resolve; Or for King Solomon (whom some
make the penman thereof) and his Son Rehoboam: However it is a direct form and
divine precept for the people of God in all hereditary kingdoms, to make
continual daily public and private Prayers, intercessions, supplications and
thanksgivings unto God for their hereditary kings, their heirs apparent and
successors to the crown and royal posterity, according to the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2.
grounded on this Psalm. I shall conclude with Psalm. 89. and Psalm. 132. of like
nature with the former; wherein not only the Psalmist, but the Churches and
Congregations of the Saints in that and succeeding ages, do sing of the mercies
of the Lord, and make known his faithfulness to all generations for making this
Covenant with David and his seed; I have made a Covenant with my chosen, I have
sworn unto David my servant; Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up
thy throne to all generations, etc. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
and my Covenant shall stand fast with him: His seed also will I make to endure
for ever, and his Throne as the days of Heaven. If his children forsake my
Laws, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my
commandments; then will I visit their transgressions with the rod, and their
sin with scourges. Nevertheless my loving kindness will I not utterly take from
him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor
alter the thing that is gone out of my lips; Once have I sworn by my holiness
that I will not lie unto David: his seed shall endure for ever, and his Throne
as the Sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the Moon, and as the
faithful witness in Heaven: Selah. (...) thy children will keep my covenant
and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon
the Throne for evermore; For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for
his habitation: This is my rest for ever, there will I dwell, for I have
desired it, etc. There will I make the horn of David to bud; I have ordained a
lamp for mine anointed: His Enemies will I cloth with shame, but upon himself
shall his crown flourish. From all these Psalms which you may read at large,
these irrefragable Conclusions may be clearly deduced.

1. That it was the constant practice, duty, not only of King David himself,
but of the Church and people of God under him and his royal posterity, to make
incessant prayers, supplications, intercessions and thanksgivings to God both
publicly and privately for him, his royal house and posterity.

2ly. That they did in their public and private devotions, prayers, psalms,
and thanksgivings, take special notice and make particular mention of Gods
promise to King David, his House, and Royal seed, that they should inherit the
Throne and kingdom over his people by succession for ever; and rejoice therein,
yea pray for its accomplishment, and Gods grace and blessing on his House,
seed, as their own and the Churches greatest blessing, happiness, and fafety.

3ly. That as the sins of David's royal seed and progeny, did not cause God
himself, the king of kings, who conferred the kingdom and throne upon them, to
break his Oath and Covenant with them, nor to deprive them of their kingly
Government, Throne, or totally to withdraw his loving kindness and mercy
toward them, but only to chastize them with his rod, and scourge them for
their amendment: So it did neither withdraw the allegiance, loyalty, duty,
prayers, supplications, intercessions, or thanksgivings of the Church and their
pious subjects from them, but rather intend and augment them, as is evident by
Psalm. 89. 38, to 59. and Psalm. 132. All which particulars do apparently check
and reprehend the contrary late practice of the Subjects and Saints within our
three kingdoms and Churches of England, Scotland and Ireland.

4ly. The piety and loyalty of David's Great Officers, and Subjects in praying
for him and his people in their conferences with and addresses to him, I shall
instance only in 3. presidents. The 1. is that of Joab his chief Captain and
General, when David commanded him to number the people, much against his
judgment and disswasions from it, 2 Samuel 24. 3. And Joab said unto the King,
The Lord thy God add uuto the People, how many soever they be, and that the
eyes of my Lord the King may see it. The 2. is that of Araunah, when king David
after the three days of Pestilence inflicted for his numbering the People, came
to buy the threshing-floor of him to build an Altar to the Lord, that the
plague might be stayed from the people, 2 Samuel 24. 21, 22, 23. And Araunah said
unto the King, The Lord thy God accept thee. Both these are direct prayers to
God for King David by these two loyal Subjects. The 3. president is the
gratulatory salutation and prayer of Hushai, when he sent him, under a
pretended revolt from him, to his son Absalom (who usurped his throne and
forced him to fly) to undermine Achitophels crafty counsel against him: thus
recorded, 2 Samuel 16. 16. And it came to pass, that when Hushai the Archite
David's friend, was come unto Absalom, he said, God save the King, God save the
King, or, Let the King live; doubling this salutation of and prayer for him.
Whence I infer these 2. probable, if not undeniable Conclusions:

1. That this salutation and prayer was usual amongst the Israelites, not only
at their kings Coronations, but upon their Officers and Subjects accesses and
addresses to them, even in king David's days, as well as in all succeeding ages.

2ly. That if Hushai thus used it to Absalom a king only by Traterous
usurpation of his Fathers Throne; he and other loyal Officers, subjects, used
it much more at the inauguration of, and their addresses to their lawful pious
king David, a man after Gods own heart.

3ly. The third king over Gods own people was Solomon, the first who enjoyed
the Crown by inheritance from David his Father by Gods special appointment, and
crowned king in his Fathers life time, to prevent the usurpations of his
Brother Adonijah, thus recorded in sacred writ, 1 kings 1. 30, to 49. When
David was old, his son Adonijah to defeat Solomon of the Crown, making a strong
party caused himself to be proclaimed king; which David being informed of by
Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, he thereupon by the advice of the Prophet Nathan,
out of a conscientious performance of the Oath he formerly swore in the name of
the Lord to Bathsheba, that Solomon her son should reign after him, which Oath
he then renewed: commanded Zadock the Priest, Nathan, and Benaiah, to take his
servants, to cause Solomon his son to ride upon his own mu^, and bring him down
to Gihon, and there to anoint him King over Israel; and blow ye with the
trumpet, and say, God save King Solomon: Then ye shall come up after him, that
he may come and sit upon my throne: for he shall be King in my stead; and I
have appointed him to be ^uler over Israel and over Judah. Whereupon Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, answered the King, and said, Amen. The Lord God of my Lord
the King say so too. As the Lord has been with my Lord the King, even so be he
with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my Lord King
David. So Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiadah, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down, and caused
Solomon to ride upon king David's Mule, and they brought him to Gibeon. And
Zadok ^he Priest took an horn of oil out of the Taberna^le and anointed
Solomon, and they blew the Trumpet, and all the people said, God save King
Solomon. And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them, and
the City rang again. Upon this Jonathan the Son of Abiathar the Priest came in
to Adonijah, and related the premises to him, and all the Ghests that were with
him; a^ding, also Solomon sits on the Throne of the kingdom, and moreover,
the Kings Servants came to bless our Lord King David, saying, God make the name
of Solomon better than thy Name, and make his Throne greater than thy Throne:
and the King bowed himself upon his Bed. And also thus said the king, Blessed
be the Lord God of Israel which has given me one to (...) (...) my Throne this
day, mine eyes even seeing it. After which 1 Kings 2. 1, to 23. 1 Chronicles. c. 28.
and 29.
David assembled all the Princes of Israel, the Princes of the Tribes, the
Captains of the Companies that ministered to the King by course, the Captains
over the thousands and over the hundreds, the Stewards over all the sub^nce and
possessions of the king and of his Sons, with the Officers and mighty men, and
with all the valiant men unto Jerusalem: Where standing upon hisfeet, he
declared to them Gods election of his son Solomon to sit upon the throne of the
kingdom of the Lord over Israel; and that he should build God an house; then
giving the Congregation and Solomon a charge, to keep and seek all the
commandments of God, and to serve him with a perfect heart and willing mind,
etc. he gave Solomon a pattern of the form, materials, vessels, chambers,
treasuries of the Temple, and courses of the Priests: After which, relating to
them the quantity of Gold, silver, precious stones, brass and other materials
he had provided and dedicated toward the building of the Temple, by his
example and exhortation, he caused both the Princes and people to offer
bountifully and willingly both gold, silver, brass, iron and precious stones
for the service of the House of God. Whereupon David made a most heavenly
thanksgiving and prayer unto God before all the Congregation, who joined with
him therein: In which prayer he and the Congregation used this expression
relating to Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 29. 18, 19. O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
Israel our fath^rs, Give unto Solomon my Son a perfect heart to keep thy
Commandments, thy Testimonies, and thy Statuteo, and to do all these things,
and to build the Palace for which I have made provision; After which all the
Congregation blessed the Lord God of their Fathers, and bowed down their heads,
and worshipped the Lord and the king. And the morrow after they sacrificed
sacrifices and offered burnt-offerings unto the Lord, even a thousand bullocks,
a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-^ffrings, and
sacrifices in abundance for all the people: and did eat and drink that day
before the Lord with gladness, and they made Solomon the son of David King the
second time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be Chief Governor, etc. v. 20,
21. From all which premises it is apparent, 1. That the Priests, Prophets,
Prince^, Captains, Officers, and all the people of God at the coronation of
Solomon (and so at their other hereditarie Kings inaugurations who succeeded
him, by like practice and custom) did blow with Trumpets, pipe with Flutes,
rejoice with exceeding joy, and cry out with united shouts, prayers,
acclamacions, God save the King, Let the King live; so that the Earth did rent,
and the City ring again with the sound thereof. 2ly. That besides this usual
short prayer and ejaculation unto God for him and their following Kings; the
greatest, devoutest of the Officers and people did break forth into other most
affectionate, pathetical expressions, and prayers for them, as Benaiah, and
other of David's servants did here in the case of Solomon saying, The Lord God
of my Lord the king say Amen too. As the Lord has been with my Lord the king
David, so let him be with Solomon, and make his name better than thy name, and
make his throne greater than thy throne. 3ly. That they joined in public
prayers to God for their Kings, after their installments in the kingdom, as the
whole Congregation did here with David for Solomon, O Lord God of Abraham, etc.
give unto my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep thy Commandments, etc. and
Ps. 132. 1, etc. 4ly. That in their usual addresses to their Kings, they bless
them, by wishing them spiritual and temporal blessings, long life and
prosperity to them, and bless God for their advancement to the Throne and
Government over them, as is evident by the 1 Kings 1. 27. 43. compared with the
2 Samuel 10. 16. and other subsequent texts. 5ly. I shall add to the premises
this passage in Huram king of Tire his letter to Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 2. 12. Huram
said moreover, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel that has made heaven and
earth, who has given to David a wise Son, endued with prudence and
understanding, that might build an house for the Lord, and an house for his
kingdom: And these words of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 9. 7, 8. 1
Kings 10. 7, 8. Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants which stand
continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom; Blessed be the Lord thy God which
delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be King for the Lord thy God;
because thy God loved Israel to establish them for ever, therefore made he
thee King over them, to do judgment and justice. Now if King Huram and the
Queen of Sheba mere foreiners, Princes, not subjects, thus blessed God for
Solomon's kingdom, justice, reign, and advancement to his fathers throne, for
the establishment and welfare of his subjects; then much more were the
Israelites themselves, his own subjects and servants, obliged to bless him,
and bless God for his reign, wisdom, and good government over them; which no
doubt they did constantly perform in their public and private Devotions, and
all their addresses to him, as also to their other Kings succeeding him;
(though not particularly recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles, which
are but short Epitomes of his and their reigns.) 3ly. When King Solomon had
finished the Temple, 1 Kings c. 7. and 8. 2 Chronicles. c. 5. and 5.
he assembled all the Elders, heads of the Tribes, and chief of the fathers of
the children of Israel, with the Priests and Levites to Jerusalem to bring up
the Ark and dedicate the Temple; where 1 Kings 8. 14, to 22. 2 Chronicles. 6. 4, to
12.
Solomon having first bl^ssed all the Congregation, he (with the whole
Congregation of Israel, standing before, and joining with him) Blessed the Lord
God of Israel, who had with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his
mouth to his father David, That his Son which should come out of his loins
should build an House to the name of the Lord God of Israel. The Lord therefore
has performed his word that he has spoken, for I am risen up in the room of
David my Father, and am set on the Throne of Israel as the Lord promised, and
have built the House for the Lord God of Israel, etc. After which 1 Kings 8.
22, to 27. 2 Chronicles. 6. 12, to 18. 42.
he stood before the Altar of the Lord upon a brazen scaffold, and kneeled upon
his knees before all the Congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
toward heaven, and said; O Lord God of Israel, there is none like thee in the
heaven, nor in the earth, which keep Covenant and show mercy unto thy
servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts. Thou which have kept
with thy servant David my father, that which thou have promised him, and
spakest with thy mouth, and have fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day:
Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel keep with thy servant David my Father that
which thou have promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a Man in my
sight to sit upon the Throne of Israel; yet so, that thy children take heed to
their way, to walk in my Law, as thou have walked before me. Now then, O Lord
God of Israel, let thy word (I pray thee) be verified, which thou have spoken
unto thy servant David, etc. O Lord God turn not away the face of thine
anointed; Remember the Mercies of David thy servant. When 1 Kings 8. 34, to 62.
66.
Solomon had ended all his prayer and supplication to the Lord, he arose from
kneeling on his knees, with his hands spread up to heaven: and he stood and
blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying; Blessed be
the Lord God that has given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that
he has promised, there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which
he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. The Lord our God be with us as he
was with our Fathers: Let him not leave us nor forsake us: that he may incline
our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his Commandments,
and his Statutes, and his Judgments, which he commanded our Fathers. And let
these my words wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto
the Lord day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the
cause of his people Israel, the thing of a day in his day, (or, at all times,
as the matter shall require) that all the People of the Earth may know, that
the Lord is God, and there is none else, etc. After all the Dedications,
sacrifices, offerings and feasts were fully ended, 1 Kings 8. 66. 2 Chronicles. 7.
10.
Solomon sent the people away, and they blessed the King, and went unto their
tents Joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had showed
unto David his servant, to Solomon, and to Israel his people. In these
remarkable passages we have King Solomon blessing all his Princes, Elders,
people, and they blessing him again; and both of them joining together in
blessings, thanksgivings, and prayers to God for his blessings, mercies, and
fulfilling of Promises, Covenants to each other and their ancestors, especially
to King David and his royal posterity, in relation to their spiritual and
temporal welfare, and exceedingly rejoicing for Gods goodness mutually bestowed
on each other; but more especially for Gods promise made and fulfilled to
David, Solomon and their royal posterity, That they should not want a man of
their seed to sit upon the throne of Israel for ever, for the real performance
whereof they all most earnestly prayed, as well as for David and Solomon; as
the only means under God of their perpetual unity, safety, felicity. Now these
Prayers, Blessings, and Thanksgivings of Solomon thus made at the dedication of
the Temple, registered by the Dictate of Gods Spirit, inserted into the History
and Canon of the Scriptures, as patterns of imitation for the Israelites and
all Gods people in succeeding generations; we cannot but conceive and
acknowledge they were frequently recited and imitated, at least by the godly
Israelites upon all occasions, both publicly and privately.

4ly. When idolatrous 1 Kings 13. 1, to 7.
King Jeroboam put forth his hand to lay hold on the Prophet and man of God,
who prophesied against his Altar at Bethel, and God thereupon immediately dried
up his hand he stretched out, so that he could not pull it in again to him;
Thereupon the King said to the man of God, Intr^at now the face of the Lord thy
God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God
besought the face of the Lord, and the Kings hand was restored again, and
became as it was before. Here we have a Prophet and man of God praying for an
Idolater and persecuting king, to restore that very hand he then stretched out
against him, to apprehend and imprison him for prophesying against his
idolatrous Altar by Gods special command. How much more then would he have
prayed for king David, Solomon, and other pious Kings to restore and preserve
their lives?

5ly. When 2 Kings 11, 4, etc. 2 Chronicles. 23.
Athaliah had slain all the seed royal of the house of David but Joash, an
infant of an year old, and usurped the Crown above six years, Jehoiada the High
Priest called the Rulers of the hundreds, and Captains of the guard, and all
the chief fathers of Israel and the Levites, and brought them into the House of
the Lord, and made a Covenant with them, and took an Oath of them, and ^ewed
them Joash the kings son (whom he hid, being but 7. years old) and said unto
them; Behold the kings son shall reign, as the Lord has said of the sons of
David. Then disposing the Captains, Guards and Levites in the Temple, with
their weapons in their hands round about Joash, they thereupon brought out the
Kings Son, and put upon him the Crown, and gave him the Testimony, and made him
King; and Jehoiadah and his sons anointed him, and they clapped their hands, and
said, God save the King And all the people of the Land rejoiced and sounded
with Trumpets, also the Singers with Iustruments of Music, and such as taught
to sing praise; praising the King. And Jehoiada took the Captains of hundreds,
and the Nobles, and the Governors of the people, and all the people of the
land, and brought down the king from the House of the Lord, and set the king
upon the throne of the kingdom. And all the people of the Land rejoiced, and
the City was quiet after they had slain Athaliah with the sword. Here we have
the self-same acclamation and prayer, Let the King live, or, God save the King,
made by Jehoiada the High Priest and his Sons, the Captains of the Army, the
Princes, Officers, Priests, with all the City and people present at the
coronation of Joash, right heir to the Crown by descent from the House of King
David, as was used at the Inaugurations of Saul and Solomon, and no doubt was
practiced at the coronations of all other Kings of Judah and Israel, though not
particularly recorded in the Sacred History of their lives and reigns, being a
thing so vulgarly known, for brevity sake, it being the received practice,
custom of all other Nations at the Coronations of their Kings and Emperors till
this very day, as is evident by Dan. 2. 4. c. 3. 9. c. 6. 6. 21. as well as
among the Israelites.

6. I shall evidence the truth of the Israelites practice in praying for their
kings whiles they lived, by what the Scripture records touching their
lamentation and public mourning for their pious and good kings when they died.
It is recorded 2 Chronicles. 35. 24, 25. that when good King Josiah died o^ his
wounds received in battle, and was buried, all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for
him: and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their
Lamentations unto this day, and made them an Ordinance in Israel, and behold
they are written in the Lamentations, writ upon this occasion amongst others,
as is evident by Lam. 4. 20. c. 5. 16. The breath of our nostrils the anointed
of the Lord, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we
shall live among the Heathen. The Crown of our head is fallen. Woe unto us that
we have sinned. If all Judah and Jerusalem, the singing men and singing women,
and Jeremiah the Prophet thus mourned for, and lamented the death of Josiah,
and their other good Kings, at and after their funerals; no doubt they
constantly prayed for their health, long life, and prosperous reigns whiles
they were living, (as the premises evidence) though not particularly recorded
in the Abridgement of their reigns, in the Books of Kings, and Chronicles.

7. Ezra, c. 9. 7. in his prayer, Nehemiah, c. 9. 32, 34. in his prayer,
Jeremiah, Lam. 2. 9. and Daniel, c. 9. 6, 8. in his prayer confessed, lamented
the sins of their Kings and Princes, and bewailed their deliverance into the
hands of the Kings of the Lands, to the Sword, to Captivity, to a spoil and
Confusion of face; and prayed, not to let all the trouble that had come upon
them seem little, etc. Therefore no doubt they constantly prayed for their
kings, during their reigns and prosperity, who thus lamented their captivity
and misery.

8. The Prophet Ezekiels injunction by God, c. 19. 10, etc. to take up a
Lamentation for the Princes of Israel because they were cut off and carried away
captives, the strong rod (of the royal progeny) broken and withered; so as
Israel had no strong rod left to be a Seepter to rule: concluding thus, this is
a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamentation. with that of the Prophet Hosea,
c. 10. 3. In that day, Israel shall say (by way of Lamentation and grief) we
have no King, because we fear^d not the Lord: what then should a King do to us?
Are convincing Arguments, that these Prophets and all fearing God, did
constantly pray for the life and continuance of their kings and kingly
Government, and Posterity, whiles they enjoyed them, as their principal earthly
blessing and security, since they thus sadly lamented the want and Captivity of
their kings, and Princes of the royal blood, to rule over them, as their
greatest misery, and infelicity, both for the present and future, till restored
to the throne again to rule over them.

9. The Israelites, whiles they were bondmen and Captives under the
Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, having no kings nor Princes of David's royal
posterity to rule over the^, did make prayers, and offer Sacrifices to God for
the lives and prosperity of these Pagan kings, and their sons too; therefore no
doubt they did it much more out of loyalty and duty for their own hereditary
kings, and their sons, whiles they reigned over them. For their practice in
relation to those foreign kings, under whom they were Captives, though Pagans,
Idolaters, and Enemies to their Nation, We have one memorable Precept, and at
least three Presidents in Scripture.

The 1. is that of Jer. 29. 1, to 9. where Jeremiah the Prophet, (by Gods
direction and command) writ thus in his letter sent from Jerusalem to the
Elders, Priests, Prophets, and all the people of Israel, when Nebuchodonosor
had carried them away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon. Thus says the Lord of
hosts, the God of Israel, uuto all who are carried away captive from Jerusalem
to Babylon: Build ye houses, plant vineyards, take ye Wives, and beget Sons and
Daughters, etc. And seek ye the peace of the City, whither I have caused you to
be carried away captive, and pray unto the Lord for it (to which Rhemigius
Haymo.
some Ancients add) and pray for the life of Nebuchodonosor and his sons,
virtually included in the former clause at least, for in the peace thereof ye
shall have peace. If all the Elders, Priests, Prophets and people of Israel,
were thus specially commanded by God himself, to pray for the Peace, and
Prosperity of this Idolatrous City of Babylon, their Ps. 137. Jer. 50, and 51.
greatest Enemies and persecutors wherein they lived in captivity and bondage,
and for King Nebuchodonosor and his sons lives, who burnt their City and Temple
at Jerusalem, destroyed, captivated their Kings, Princes, kingdom, Nation, and
sent them captives to Babylon; because in their Peace and prosperity themselves
should enjoy peace and tranquillity even in and under their bondage; Then
doubtless were they much more obliged in duty, piety, prudence, to pray for
the peace, life, health and felicity of their own Kings, kingdom, and royal
City of Jerusalem, whiles they there lived under their royal Government. I
shall compare this with Baruch, 1. where we read the Jews in Babylon, upon
reading of Baruchs book, made a collection of money, and sent it to Jerusalem
unto Joachim the High Priest, and to the Priests and all the people which were
found at Jerusalem. And they (the Jews who brought it) said, Behold we have
sent you money to buy Burnt-offerings, and Sin Offerings, and Incense, and
prepare ye Meat Offerings, and offer upon the Altar of the Lord our God: And
pray for the life of Nebuchodonosor K. of Babylon, and for the life of
Balthazar his Son, that their days may be upon Earth as the days of Heaven.
And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live
under the shadow of Nebuchodonosor King of Babylon, and under the shadow of
Balthazar his Son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favor in their
sight. Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the
Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not
turned from us. From which passage (though it be Apocryphal) it is apparent,
that the Jews during their captivity both at Babylon and Jerusalem did
constantly pray to God for the long life, welfare, and prosperous reign of
Nebuchodonosor, and his Son after him, though Pagan-Idolators, and Enemies who
destroyed their Country, City, Temple, led most of them away Captives out of
their own Land, and made them Tributaries and Bondmen to them Therefore much
more did they and were they bound in duty, loyalty, allegiance, and prudence,
to pray for their own hereditary, natural, rightful kings of David's royal
Family whiles they reigned over them.

The 2. is the observable president of the Prophet Daniel himself, Dan. 6. who
did accordingly perform this Darius, though a Pagan King, an Idolater, an Enemy
to the whole Jewish Nation, a Foreiner, of the Persian, not Israelitish race,
an impious Tyrant, Persecutor, if not Enemy to himself and the true God,
making, establishing, and signing this royal Decree at the solicitation of his
Princes, on purpose to ensnare Daniel, That whosoever shall ask a Petition of
any God or Man for thirty days, save of King Darius himself, should be cast
into the Lions den; for breach of which impious dec^ee by praying to God,
Daniel was cast by the Kings commandment, through the Princes malice against
him, into the Lions den, and a stone laid at the mouth of the den, which the K.
sealed with his own signet and the signet of his Lords, that the purpose might
not be changed concerning Daniel: Yet, notwithstanding all these circumstances,
which might in the judgment of flesh and blood disoblige Daniel from his
dutiful alle^iance to and prayer for Darius his life and happiness; No sooner
did King Darius come to the Lions den the next morning, early, crying with a
lamentable voice, and saying, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God
whom thou servest continually able to deliver th^e from the Lions? but Daniel,
the very first words he used, brake forth into this most loyal salutation of,
and prayer for him, v. 20, 21. O King live for ever. My God has sent his
Angel, and has shut up the Lions mouths, that they have not hurt me; for as
much as before him innocence was sound in me, and also before thee O King have
I done no hurt: calling him King no less than twice together, no^ Tyrant,
Infidel, Persecutor, Enemy of God, and his people (as some degenerate Saints of
this Age would have done, without any such injustice as he suffered from and by
his decree) and using the self-same Salutation to and Prayer for him, and other
idolatrous persecuting Kings, as their natural born Subjects and Princes used,
as is evident by comparing this Text with Dan. 2. 4. c. 3. 9. c. 5. 10. c. 6.
6. Therefore questionless he and other godly Israelites did, and would have
manifested the like loyalty, piety, and reverence toward their own hereditary
Kings of David's posterity in their own Country, though Idolaters, Persecutors,
Tyrants, much more when just, upright, merciful, bountiful, and religious.

The 3. is the memorable Decree of King Darius, concerning Jerusalem, and the
chief end thereof, recorded Ezra 6. 3, to 14. Moreover I make a Decree, that
you shall do for the Elders of these Jews, for the building of the House of
God, that of the Kings Goods, even of the Tribute beyond the River, forthwith
expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered. And that which they
have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the Burnt-offerings
of the God of Heaven, wheat, salt, wine and oil, according to the appointment
of the Priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without
fail, that they may offer Josephus Antiqu. Iudae. l. 11. c. 4. (...) n^n
desinentes quotidie sacrificare, TAM PRO ME, quam pro Persarum gente Deum
deprecantur.
Sacrifices of sweet savors unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of
the King, and of his Sons. Also I have made a Decree, that whosoever shall
alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up,
let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a dunghill for this, etc
By this Decree it is most apparent, 1. That the Priests and people of God at
Jerusalem, living as Tributaries under this pagan Persian King, were specially
enjoined and required by his royal decree, day by day to offer Sacrifices, and
pray unto the God of Heaven for the life of the King, and of his Sons, of which
there could be but these two probable grounds: either, that they used thus
daily to offer Sac^ifices and prayers to the God of heaven for their own
hereditary Kings and their Sons in the old Temple at Jerusalem, by David's and
Solomon's injunction, before it was demolished; as they were now ordered after
its rebuilding and repair; which is most probable, since their ancient usual
daily Sacrifices and prayers for the King and his Sons are here conjoined. Or,
because their own pagan Priests used to do so in Persia, Babylon, and their own
ancient Dominions. 2. That this Decree in all its part^, specially in this
last, was so peremptory and penal, that whosoever should alter or disobey it,
was to have the Timber pulled from his house, and hanged thereon, and his house
to be made a Dunghill for this. Therefore this Duty was no doubt constantly
performed by the Priests and Elders of the Jews in whose favor it was made. If
then those Priests and Subjects demerited such a severe punishment as this, for
refu^ing or neglecting to make daily sacrifices and prayers to the God of
Heaven for this foreign Pagan King and his Sons, to whom they were only Captives
and Tributaries; what penalties, executions do those undutifull disloyal
Christian Subjects and Ministers deserve, who wilfully neglect, refuse, nay
prohibit under grievous penalties, daily Prayers and Intercessions to be made
to the God of heaven for their own undoubted natural hereditary Christian
Protestant Kings and their Sons, against the purport of this Decree, and the
express injunction of God himself in the New Testament, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3? No
doubt hanging, and demolishing their Houses is too good for them, if this Pagan
King may be Umpire.

The 4. is the Decree of King Artaxerxes to Ezra the for moneys to buy
Bullocks, Rams, Lambs, with their Meat Offerings and Drink Offerings, and to
offer them upon the Alter of the house of God which was at Jerusalem, Ezra 7.
11, to 25. in which Decree, though there be no such express clause as in the
former, to offer Sacrifices and Prayers to the God of Heaven for the King and
his Sons; yet it is comprised therein in the general, being but a confirmation
of the Decree of Darius, and it is clearly intimated and expressed in the
reason of this Decree at the close thereof. Whatsoever is commanded by the God
of Heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of Heaven, for
why should there be wrath against the Realm of the King and his Sons? which
wrath Ezra, the Priests and people of Israel, worshipping the God of Heaven,
were to deprecate and stave off by their daily public Sacrifices and prayers
to the God of Heaven, in the behalf of this King, his Sons and Realm, and
praying for their welfare and prosperity; which no doubt they constantly
performed, as is evident by Ezraes special Thanksgiving to God, v. 27, 28.
Blessed be the Lord God of our Fathers which has put such a thing as this into
the Kings heart, to beautify the House of the Lord which is at Jerusalem, and
has extended mercy unto me before the King and his Counselors, and before the
Kings mighty Princes, and chapter 9. 8, 9, 10. And now for a little space Grace
has been showed from the Lord our God to leave us a remnant to escape, and to
give us a Nayl in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give
us a little reviving in our bondage. For we were Bondmen, yet our God has not
forsaken us in our Bondage, but has extended mercy to us in the sight of the
King of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the House of our God, and to
repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy
commandment, etc. The recital of which mercy in Ezra his solemn Thanksgiving,
and also in his public humiliation, was a most effectual prayer for this King
and his Sons, and praising God for the benefits extented to his people by their
means and favor.

Apion accused the Jews to the Emperor Caius Caligula (who usurped to himself
divine honor) that when all other Nations throughout the Roman Empire,
dedicated Temples and Altars to him, and erected his Statue in their Temples,
and swear by his name; that the Jews would do neither, nor permit his Statue to
be set up in the Temple of their God; whereupon he commanded Petronius with two
Legions to make war upon the Jews, unless they would erect his Statue in the
Temple; which they peremptorily opposed, as being contrary to the law of their
God, and custom of their Ancestors, choosing rather all to dye, and offering
their Necks to the Block, than to permit such a transgression against their
Gods law. Hereupon they sent Ambassadors to Caius, whereof Philo was chief, to
satisfy him; who informed him, that though they could not erect his Statue,
nor adore him as a God, being contrary to their Religion, yet such was their
loyalty toward him, That they did twice every day offer Sacrifices and prayers
unto their God for him in the Temple. Therefore no doubt they did the like for
Darius, Artaxerxes, Nebuchadnezzar, and other Kings to whom they were
Tributaries, and much more for their own natural Kings and their Sons of the
House of David.

Xly. God himself gave this express prohibition to the Israelites, Exodus 22.
26. Thou shall not revile the Gods, nor curse the Ruler of thy People: repeated
Acts 23. 3. and thus seconded Eccles. 10. 20. Curse not the King, no not in thy
thoughts, for a bird of the Air shall carry the voice, and that which has
wings shall tell the matter: Therefore it is clear by the rule of contraries,
yea by Christ's and Paul's own expositions, resolutions, Mat. 5. 44. Lu. 6. 28.
Romans 12. 14. that they were to bless and pray for them, yea though they
persecuted, and despitefully used them. Shimei for violating these divine
Precepts in cursing and railing against King David, and stiling him a Man of
blood, etc^ when he fled from his usurping Son Absalom, was thought worthy to
lose his head by A^ishai, who would have cut it off, bad not David for the
present forbad his execution, 2 Samuel 16. 7, to 10. c. 19. 21. For which crime
Solomon by David's order, afterward put him to death, 2 Kings 2. 8. 44, 45, 46.
using this speech unto him, Thou know all the wickedness which thy heart is
privy to, that thou did to David my Father: therefore the Lord shall return
thy wickedness upon thine own head; and King Solomon shall be blessed, and the
Throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever; whereas Shimei
said, the Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in
whose stead thou have reigned, and the Lord has delivered thy Kingdom into the
hand of Absalom thy Son, and behold thou art taken in thy mischief, because
thou art a bloody man. Now if this sin of his in cursing and railing against
David his King was a capital crime and treason deserving death ^ and God
himself reputes it an heinous offense in the idolatrous Israelites and others,
when vexed with famine, oppression, and other judgments by evil Kings, to
curse their King and look upwards, Isay 8. 21. Then questionless, it is a
grievous sin, and capital offense for Subjects to give over, and prohibit all
public and private Prayers for their Kings, or curse the^ though wicked,
oppressive, idolatrous, tyrannical, much more when just, good, pious,
christian, orthodox, and not only to curse, but dethrone, murder them, eject,
banish and disinherit their royal posterities, and abolish their Kingly
Government, for which they can expect naught else but exemplary punishments,
and the reward of Shimei both from God and men, being contrary to all the
recited Presidents of Gods Saints and people under the law.

CHAP. III.
I Proceed now to the last Classis of Presidents for supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and thansgivings for Kings under the Gospel, where I shall begin
with Jesus Christ the King of Kings, the principal subject matter, Author of,
and first K. under the Gospel: which as it begins with the Genealogy and
Nativity of Jesus Christ, who was born King of the Jews, and inquired after,
worshipped, presented with Gold, Mirrhe, and Frankincense by the Wisemen, under
the notion of a King, Mat. c. 1, and 2. 1, 2, etc. So it informs us, that at
his birth an Angel of the Lord appeared to the Shepherds, saying, Behold I
bring un^o you tidings of great joy which shall be to all people; for unto you
is born this day in the City of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And
suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising
God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, in earth peace, good will toward
men, Lu. 2. 9, to 15. Of this King Jesus, (to whom the Angel appearing to his
Mother Mary before his conception, said, That the Lord God shall give unto him
the Throne of his Father David, and he shall reign over the House of Jacob for
ever, and of his Kingdom there shall be no end, Lu. 1. 32, 33.) his Father King
David many hundred years before his Nativity, thus prophesied, Ps. 72. 15, 17.
To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba, Prayer also shall be made for him
continually, and daily shall he be praised, all Nations shall call him Blessed.
And the Prophet Zechariah thus prop^ecyed conce^ning him, c. 9. 9. Rejoice
greatly O Jerusalem, Behold thy King comes unto thee: he is just, and bringing
Salvation, riding upon an Ass, and upon a Colt, the foal of an Ass: which
Prophecies were fulfilled, both by the earnest Prayers and Desires of many
Prophets, Kings and righteous men, to see and hear King Jesus, before his
incarnation; by the Songs of rejoicing and thanksgiving at and for his very
conception and birth, recorded Mat. 13. 16, 17. Lu. 10. 23, 24. c. 1. 42, 45,
68, 69, 70, etc. c. 2. 20, to 39. 37, 38. Mat. 2. 1, to 12. And at his
triumphant riding like a King unto Jerusalem on an Ass and its foal, Matthew.
21. 5, to 17. Mar. 11. 1, to 18. Lu. 19. 29, etc. At which time a very great
multitude spread their Garments in the way, others cut down branches from the
Trees, and strawed them in the way; and when he was come nigh to the descent of
the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude that went before and followed after,
began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice, and cried saying,
Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Marolat. on the place.
Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed be he that comes in the name of the
Lord, Hosanna in the highest: Blessed be the Kingdom of our Father David,
Hosanna in the highest: Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the
Lord, peace in Heaven and glory in the highest. And when some of the Pharisees
from among the multitude said unto him, Master rebuke thy Disciples; He
answered and said unto them, If these men should hold their peace, the stones
would immemediatly cry out. After which the Chief Priests and Scribes seeing
the wonderful things he did; and the Children crying in the Temple, saying,
Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased and said unto him.
Hear thou what they say? Jesus says unto them, Yea, have ye not read, Ps.
8. 2.
Out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings thou have perfected praise. This is
likewise evident by those very clauses in the form of prayer, which Christ
himself recommended to his Disciples, to be daily used by them, Mat. 6. 1^. 13.
thy Kingdom come, (o^t styled ( Mat. 19. 28. c. 20. 21. Lu. 1. 33. c 22, 30. c.
23 42. John 18. 36. Col. 1. 13. 2 Timothy 41. Heb. 1. 8 2 Pet. 1. 11. Romans 1. 9.
) ^ Christ's Kingdom in the Gospel, as well as the Fathers) for thine is the
Kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever, Amen; By that Prayer of
all Gods Saints, Rev. 22. 20. Amen, Even so Lord Jesus come quickly. And by
that Song of the Lamb, which they who had gotten victory over the Beast, having
the harps of God, do sing, Rev. 15. 2, 3, 4^ Great and mavelous are thy works
Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways thou King of Saints; who shall
not fear thee O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy, for all
Nations shall come and worship before thee. All which sacred Texts, Prayers,
Praises, Songs and Thanksgivings for the Nativity, Kingship, Kingdom, and
inauguration of Jesus Christ as a King into his Kingly Office, and for the
second coming of his Person and Kingdom of Glory; are sufficient Presidents,
grounds, warrants, for all Christian Subjects under the Gospel, to rejoice,
triumph, wi^h Songs and Psalms of Thanksgiving, and exceeding joy, both at the
Births and Coronations of their Kings, Princes, yea to pray for their Persons,
Kingdoms, Posterities Felicity, Stability, Tranquillity, Perpetuity, and for
their speedy coming, restitution, when forcibly driven from their Kingdoms by
Enemies or Rebels. And if any malicious Pharisees, Priests, Scribes, or
^rayterous Antimonarchists shall be sore displeased with them for these their
Prayers, Praises, Rejoycings, Thanksgivings, and rebuke them for the same; King
Jesus his own Answer to the Pharisees, Priests and Scribes forecited, may for
ever stop their mouths, and reclaim them from such disloyal, ^reasonable
rebukes.

And so much the rather, because these premi^ Presidents both before and under
the L^w and Gospel, app^ved, prescribed by God, and practiced by his Servants,
were the ground of this Gospel exhortation and injunction, which not only
approve^, and prescribes, but commends the same to all Christians under the
Gospel, in these observable words, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. I exhort therefore that
first of all Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of thanks be
made for all men; for Kings, (in the first place as Supreme, 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.)
and for all that are in Authority, (under and after them) that we may live a
quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, for this is good and
acceptable in the sight of God our Savior; who will have all men to be saved,
and come to the knowledge of the truth. I shall a little insist on this Gospel
Text, as most punctual, full, pertinent to my purpose, the rather, because in
See Mr. Smith his Gagg for the Quakers, p. 8, 9.
August 1659. in the University of Cambridge it self, a Minister of the Gospel,
the Son of a Parliament man, was by the Mayor of the town (whose wife is a
Quaker) apprehended by a company of Soldiers, and kept Prisoner for a time,
only for praying in general for all Christian Kings, Princes, and Governors,
according to this Text: when George Whitehead and George Fex, two Quakers,
blasphemously railed, and disputed against Jesus Christ, the two other Persons,
the blessed Trinity, and the word of God, an whole hour together in the Majors
presence, and sundry others, without check or punishment; such are the
atheistical, antimonarchical times wherein we live. In this text consider, 1.
The Penman of it by divine inspiration, S. Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ
specially delegated by him to the Gentiles and uncircumcision, to open their
eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from ^he power of Satan unto
God; And to bear Christ's name before the Gentiles and Kings, Acts 9. 15. c. 26.
1^, 17, 18. Gal. 2. 2, 7, 8, 9. Ephesians. 3. 1, to 12. Acts 13. 46, 47. c. 15. 7. c.
18. 6. c 21^ 19, 20. c. 22 21. c. 28. 28. Rom 11. 13. c. 15. 15, to 25. Col. 1.
27, 28. 2 Timothy 1. 11. c. 4. 17. Therefore these Duties are specially
recommended and prescribed to them. 2ly. The person to whom this Epistle and
exhortation was principally, and particularly directed, even Timothy his dearly
beloved Son, and Fellow^ Minister in preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles, then
residing at Ephesus, 1 Timothy 1, 3. a City and Church of the Gentiles, where he
exercised his Ministry, and was to perform these Duties publicly in his own
person as a Minister, to excite all others thereunto. Therefore these Duties of
making public Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions and Thanksgivings for
Kings both in public and private, do principally belong, and are carefully to
be performed by all Ministers and Preachers of the Gospel to and amongst the
Gentiles. 3ly. The manner of pressing these Duties; the Apostle does most
earnestly and zealously urge their performance; as the words I exhort, or
earnestly desire, import, Exhortings, being the most passionate, pathetical,
fervent pressing of men to duties, Lu. 3. 18. Act. 11. 23. c. 13. 15. c. 2. 40.
c. 15. 32. c. 20. 2. Romans 12. 8. 1 These. 2. 11, 12. c. 4. ^. c. 5. 14. 2 These.
3. 12. 1 Timothy 4. 13. c. 6. 2. 2 Timothy 4. 2. Tit. 1. 9. c. 2. 6, 15. Heb. 3. 13.
c. 12. 5. c. 13. 22. 1 Pet. 5. 1. Jude 3. 4ly. The grounds of his enforcing
these Duties so earnestly, employed in the word therefore, relating to the close
of the precedent Chapter, v. 18, 19, 20. This charge I commit unto thee Son
Timothy, according to the Prophecies that we^ before on thee; that thou by them
might war a good warfare, holding Faith and a good Conscience: which he
could not do or perform, unless he discharged these Duties he thus exhorted him
to, being a part of his spiritual good warfare, and both a means and evidence
of his holding Faith and a good Conscience; and his neglect or contempt of
them, a ready way to make shipwreck of them, as Hymeneus and Alexander had
done, whom he had dilivered to Satan. Antimonarchical and Antimagistratical
Ministers or Christians will soon turn Apostates, and Blasphemers, yea put away
and make shipwreck of their Faith and good Conscience toward God, when they
became disloyal and rebellious to their Kings, and give over Supplications,
Prayers, Intercessions and Thanksgivings for them, as we have found by late sad
experiments. 5ly. The primacy and excellency of these Duties before all others,
expressed in the clause, I exhort therefore that first of all, that is, in the
first place, before and above all other Duties, parts of Ministry or
Christianity, they are carefully, conscienciously, cordially to be performed,
without the least omission or neglect. 6ly. The variety of the Duties, set
forth by these various expressions, That Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions
and Thanksgivings, (all in the plural number) be made for Kings: Which
pluralities imply, 1. A universality of their several kinds, to wit, Ephesians. 6.
16. 1 Kings 8. 38.
That all sorts of Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions and Thanksgivings
whatsoever ought to be made for them. 2ly. Ps. 72. 20. I. say 1. 15. Lu. 2. 37.
Acts 2. 42. Romans 15. 30.
A multiplicity of each of them, not a single Supplication, Prayer,
Intercession, Thanksgiving, and no more; but many and manifold Supplications,
Prayers and Thanksgivings. 3ly. A frequency, fervency, constancy, perpetuity in
the performance of them both in public and private, all our lives long,
without ceasing, or flagging, as the 1 Samuel 12 23. Ps. 72. 15. Ps. 55. 17. Mat.
26. 41. Lu. ^8. 1, etc. 1 These. 5. 17. 2 These. 1. 1^. Ephesians. 6. 18. 1 These. 3^
10. 2 Timothy 1. 3. Jam. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 4. 7. Col. 1. 3, 9. c. 4. 2, 12. Acts 6. 4.
c 12. 5. u See Chrysostom, Hierom, Remigius, Beda, The Divi^es and Dr. Hamonds
Notes on the 1 Timothy 2. 1. 2, 3. Augustine. Epist. 59.
marginal Scriptures evidence. 4ly. An universality in respect of persons and
places, thus expressed in the verse following, I will therefore that men pray
every where lifting up holy hands. 5ly. An universality of things, Mercies,
Blessings, etc. for which Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions and
Thanksgivings ought at any time ordinarily or extraordinarily, publicly or
privately to be made to God in behalf of Kings. 6ly. Supplications for the
pardon and remission of all their sins, errors, miscariages, frailties,
iniquities whatsoever; for converting, diverting, or keeping them from all evil
and destructive ways, errors, counsels, designs, undertakings whatsoever,
dishonorable to God, scandalous to Religion, hurtful to the Church, fatal to
their Kingdoms, People, Royal persons, families and posterity; and for
removing all inflicted, threatened or feared judgments, evils from their
Persons, Families, Kingdoms, Relations. Prayers for all sorts of corporal,

his gracious love and favor to them upon all occasions. Thanksgivings, for
their births, coronations, health, lives, wisdom, power, justice, graces,
preservations, issues, posterity; all sorts of mercies, blessings, favors,
victories, successes, deliverances from evils, sicknesses, dangers, 'enemies,

Safety, Liberty, Prosperity, Laws, Privileges, Parliaments; exemptions from
Oppressions, Rapines, Murders, Rapes, extortions, Illegal Taxes, Excises,
Executions, Imprisonments, banishments, wars; for all particular benefits and
royal favors conferred by them on their own persons, or relations. All these
and what ever else are or may be included in Supplications, prayers,
intercessions, thanksgivings, are here prescribed to all Ministers and
Christians under the Gospel in behalf of their Kings.

primacy and precedence of Kings above all other Governors and persons in
authority, both in all our supplications, prayers, intercessions,
thanksgivings, and likewise in their Civil dignity and Authority: For although
the Apostle to avoid all suspicion of flattery (as the Chrysostom^ Theodoret,
Oecumenius, Theophilact, ^mbrose.
Fathers observe) exhorts in the first place, that Prayers, etc. should be mad^
for all men in general; yet when he comes to the pa^ticular enumeration of
them, he places Kings in the front before all others, being ranked before them
all by the Apostle, in these words, For Kings, and all that are in Authority;
and more particularly by the Apostle Peter 1 Pet. 13, 14. Submit your selves to
every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake: whether to the King, as supreme, or
unto Governors, as to those who are sent by him, etc. 8ly. The plurality and

KINGS: in the plural, not singular number; and that without any restriction of
their personal qualifications, extending universally to all Kings, and
excluding none, though Hierom, Chrysostom, Sedulius, ^imasius, Ambrose,
Theodo^er, Rhemigius, Oecume^ius, Beda, Theophylact.
Pagans, Idolaters, Heretics, Schismatics, Tyrants, Oppressors, Persecutors,
Murderers, Wicked, Profane, Vicious, Flagitious in any kind; for which many
might doubt whether they ought to pray, which the Apostle fully clears by this
general expression: as well as for the most Christian, Pious, Just, Righteous,
Virtuous Kings, for which all will grant Christians ought to make
supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, without dispute. This I
shall clear by 5. undeniable Arguments: 1. Because all Kings, Emperors, Princes
throughout the world when this Epistle was written, and for above 500 years
after, (but Lucius) were Pagans, Idolaters, and for the most part see ^usebius,
Socrates Scholasticus, Nicephorus, Dorotheus, B^, (...) (...) (...) others.
bitter persecutors of the Saints, Church of Christ; and some transcendently
impious, flagitious, especially Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, under whom Paul
lived, and suffered Martyrdom, with others of the Apostles, and many hundreds
of Christians; yet even St. Paul himself exhorts first of all, that
supplications, intercessions, prayers and thanksgivings should be made for them
by Timothy, and all other Christian^ then living under them. 2ly. Because the
Apostles p^ecedent and subsequent exhortation, is universal, for all Men, for
Kings, and All that are in Authority: If then we must make supplications,
prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings for all men, good or bad, then certainly
for all Kings, though the Apostle had not named Kings, because all Kings are
men, and included in the general all men: and if for all that are in Authority
or Eminent place, then certainly for all Kings; being in supremest Authority
and Eminency; and included by name between those two universals, All men, All
in Authority. 3ly. Because the subsequent words, that under them we may lead a
quiet and peaceable li^e, in all godliness and honesty: And, who will have all
men to be saved, and to come to ^he know edge of the truth, implies, that the
Kings, and all in Authority, at that time, for whom they are exhorted to make
supplications, etc. were persecutors, under whom they had no present rest nor
quietness, and unconverted to the knowledge of the truth and means of
salvation. 4ly. Because St. Paul's precept, Romans 12. 14. Bless them which
persecute you, bless and curse not; compared with v. 20, 21. Romans 13. 1, to 10.
Titus 3. 1, 2, 3. paralleld with our Saviors own reiterated precept, Mat. 5.
44, 45. Luke 6. 27, 28, 29. But I say unto you, love your Enemies; Bless them
that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that
despitefully use you, and persecute you; And unto him that smites thee on the
one cheek, offer him also the other: and him that takes away thy cloak, forbid
not to take thy coat also; that you may be the children of your Father which is
in heaven; for he makes his Sun to rise to the evil, and to the good, and
sends rain on the just and on the unjust. Which precept relates principally
to Kings and Rulers, before whom they should be brought, presecuted, and put to
death, Mat. 10. 18, to 38. Lu. 21. 12, etc. 5ly. Because he never exhorted,
commanded, encouraged in the least degree, any Christians to curse or pray
against their Kings, though Pagans, Tyrants, Persecuters: much less to rebel
against, depose, or dethrone, behead, execute them. If Christians then be thus
exhorted, obliged by the Apostle to make prayers, supplic^tions, intercessions,
and thanksgivings even for their Persecuting, Tyrannical, Pagan, wicked Kings,
not to depose, murder, execute them in High Courts of Justice, or to extirpate
their royal posterity, Kingship, and alter their form of Government which they
are professedly prohibited to do for conscience sak^, under pain of damnation,
in di^ect terms, Romans 13. 1, to 7. Tit. 3. 1. and 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Then
certainly they are much more obliged to make supplications, prayers,
intercessions, thanksgivings for^ their hereditary Christian, Protestant,
Orthodox, rightful Kings, and not to dethrone, murder, execute them in any
strange High Courts of Justice, nor to extirpate their royal issue, Kingship,
and change their whole frame of Government, from which they are expressly
prohibited by these Gospel Texts, and restrained by their Solemn Oaths of
Aliegeance, Fealty, Supremacy, Protestation, Vow, League, Covenant, under pain
of eternal damnation, and the guilt of highest Perjury, Treachery, Rebellion.

That King which is born comes not to overcome Kings by fighting, but to

can be greater, wiser, powerfuller than their Lord, King Jesus, who came not to
dethrone, uncrown any earthly Kings, and reign alive in their steads, but to
conquer and triumph over them only by his death, though King of Kings and Lord
of Lords: in daring to ravish not only the Crowns, but Lives, Kingdoms,
hereditary Lands, Revenues, Powers, Kingships of their Christian Sovereigns,
instead of making Supplications, Prayers, Interceisions. Thanksgivings for
them, and their Royal posterity, let their own Consciences resolve them, and
all others who preach the Gospel, wherein there is neither Precept nor
President for such Antichristian, Jesuitical practices.

9ly. The end, reason why Ministers, Christians and other Subjects should make
Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, Thnaksgivings for their very
persecuting, tyrannizing, oppressing Pagan KINGS, G^vernours, and yielding
patient loyal Subjection under them is, because it is the most effectual means
prescribed by God, whereby to reclaim, conver^, save them, by overcomming their
evil with goodness, Romans 12. 20, 21. the most probable, ready, prevalent course
by which they themselves may lead a quiet and peaceable life under them in all
godliness and honesty; and recover, enjoy both their invaded civil and
Christian Liberties; not their mutinous Rebellions or taking up Arms against
them, forcibly to reform or dethrone them, which would but increase their
troubles, pressures, persecutions, interrupt their peace, quietness, yea make
shipwreck of their godliness, honesty, loyalty, faith, and good Consciences,
which we have found true, by late sad experiments. Upon which ground the
Apostle Paul thus describes the deportment of himself, and the other Apostles
and Christians under their Persecutors, 1 Cor. 12, 13. being reviled, we bless,
being persecuted, we suffer, being defamed, we entreat, according to our
Saviors forecited Precept, Mat. 5. 44, 45. seconded with his own example, and
Stephens, who prayed for their murdering Persecutors at their very deaths, Luke
23. 34. Acts 7. 60. leaving us an example that we should follow their steps
herein, 1 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23. Ja^. 5. 6, to 12.

10ly. The motive God here used to excite Timothy and all other Christians to
make Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and Thanksgivings for Kings and all
in Authority under them, whether good or bad, Pagans or Christians, Persecutors
or Protectors of Religion, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God
our Savior, as well as beneficial to themselves, their Kings and Governors in
the last recited respects. And if so, then the neglecting, rejecting,
inhibiting of these Duties in public or private, must questionless be very
evil, sinful, displeasing in the fight of God our Savior, who will severely
punish it; yea a means to hinder us from enjoying and leading a quiet and
peaceable life in all godliness and honesty; or any Settlement or Tranquillity,
in Church and State, which we have long expected, endeavored, desired, and
prayed for, but never enjoyed since we neglected, and rejected this duty of
making Supplications, Prayers, Intercessi^ns, Thanksgivings for our Kings; and
casting off their Persons and Kingly Government, and a^e never likely to enjoy,
till we Loyally and Conscientiously restore both them and these duties for
them, prescribed in and by this Gospel Text, which I have opened and pressed to
the full, upon this consideration, and the Apostles Resolutions, Acts 4. 19. c.
5. 29. We ought to obey God, rather than Men.

11ly. This exhortation of Paul, was practiced by himself, when he was brought
as a Prisoner, and pleaded his cause before King Agrippa, Acts 26. 28, 29. Who
saying to Paul, almost thou perswadest me to be a Christian. Thereupon Paul
said, I would to God not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were
both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. A direct prayer
to God, for this Kings, and his other Auditors Conversion to Christianity.

Thus much for Scripture Presidents and Precepts, warranting and commanding
this duty, both before, and under the Law and Gospel. I now proceed to other
Testimonies in the Primitive Church, as well for Pagan, Arrian and heretical
persecuting Emperors, Kings, Princes, as for Christian, Orthodox, and such who
were Protectors of Christianity and Christians.

CHAP. IV.
FOr the practice of the Primitive Church and Christians to^ching their public
and private prayers, intercessions, supplications for Kings and Emperors,
though Pagans and Persecutors, as then they were, no doubt it is as ancient as
the Apostles themselves, as is evident by the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. and practiced by
them, in their public Liturgies, if we believe the Liturgies fathered upon St.
Peter, and St. Mark, to be genuine.

In the Mass of St. Peter (published by William Lindan, Bishop of Gaunt)
printed in Bibliotheca Patrum, Coloniae Agrip. 1618. Tom. 1. p. 210. E. I find
the Deacon saying In pace Rogemus Dominum, pro Religiosissimis Augustis, u^ una
propugnent, etc. But this Mass, twice mentioning the mediation and
intercession, beatorum Apostolorum Petri, Pauli, Cornelii, Cypriani, Laurentii,
etc. (some of them not living till 200. years after Peter's death,) and speaking
of Peter only as a Saint and Martyr departed; and this prayer being not for any
Pagan, but most religious Christian Emperors, This Mass is certainly a gross
Popish forgery fathered upon Peter some hundreds of years after his death; yet
I thought meet to mention this passage in it.

The Liturgy attributed to St. Mark the Evangelist, Peter's Disciple, as it is
but a Popish forgery as well as Peter's, yet because it contains some set
observable Prayers for Kings, I shall here insert them, as translated out of
the Greek Copy. Biblioth. Patrum, Coloniae Agrip. Tom. 1. p. 21. C. Sacerdos
hunc in modum orat. Dominator Domine, Deus omnipotens, Pater Domini and Dei,
and Servatoris nostri Jesu Christi, precamur and obsecramus te, ut Regem
nostrum in pace et fortitudine justitiaque conserves. Subjicito ei, o Deus,
omnem inimicum and adversarium. Apprehende arma and scutum, and exurge in
adjutorium ejus. Da ei, o Deus, victorias, ut animum ad ea intendat, quae nobis
pacifica sunt, and ad nomen sanctum tuum. Ut and nos in tranquillitate dierum
ejus quietam et tranquillam vitam degamus in omni pietate and honestate, gratia
and commiserationibus, and benignitate unigeniti filii tui, etc. Unto which
Prayer all the People are to say, Amen.

After which p. 23. follow these two Prayers. Regem, Legiones, Principes,
Senatus and Concilia, Populos nostros in omni pace disponito. Rex Regum et
Domine dominantium, Regnum servi tui orthodoxi et Christum amantis Regis
nostri, quem super terram regnare justum censuisti, in pace, et fortitudine, et
justitia, et tranquillitate conserva. Subjicito ei, Deus, omnem hostem et
adversarium, tam nostratem quam externum. Apprehende arma et scutum, and exurge
in adjutorium ei. Obumbra super caput ejus in die belli: fac, ut de fructu
lumbi ejus sedeat super sedem ejus. Loquere ad cor ejus bona, pro sancta tua
Catholica and Apostolica Ecclesia, and omni Christum amante populo, ut and nos
in tranquillitate ejus, tranquillam and quietam vitam degamus, in omni pietate
and sanctitate. Which latter Prayer is only for Christian Kings, the former for
Pagan as well as Christian, both founded on the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2.

But to omit these spurious, I shall proceed to true genuine Antiquities.

Polycarpus the Disciple of St. John, and the Elders with Anno Christi 120.
him, about 120. years after Christ's Nativity, in their Bibliotheca Patrum,
Coloniae Agrip. 1618. Tom. 1. p. 96. G.
Epistle to the Church of God at Philippi, precisely enjoin them, to pray for
Kings, Potentates, and Princes, (then all Pagans) and likewise for their
Persecutors, Haters, and Enemies to Christ's Cross, that their fruit may be
made manifest in all things, and that they might be made perfect in Christ.

Justin Martyr in his 2d. Apology for the Christians to An^o 150.
Aelius Adrianus, and Antoninus pius the Emperors, and the Senate of Rome,
about the year of Christ 150. thus relates the loyalty of the Christians to
them, both in paying Tributes and praying to God for them, though Pagans, and
Persecutors of Christianity. Bibliotheca Patrum Tom. 2. p. 43. G. H.
Tributa vero and census iis qui a vobis constituti sunt, ubique in primis
conamur pendere, quemadmodum ab eo ( Christo) instituti sumus: cum enim ad eum
quidam adiissent, quaererentque, number tributum pendendum esset Caesari? qua
(...) qu: ^x iis vicissim, cujus imaginem and simulachrum nummus haberet? ac
respondissent Caesaris: rursus eis respondit^ Reddite ergo quae sunt Caesaris,
Caesari; and quae sunt Dei, Deo. Hinc Deum solum adoramus; vobis autem in alii^
rebus laeti servimus, Regesque vos and Principes hominum esse profitemur;
Rogamusque ut ^os, cum Regali potestate, sanam bonamque mentem habere
inveniamini. Quod si nobis etiam precantibus, and in lucem omnia proferentibus,
negligetis, nihil ex eo detrimenti capiemus, etc. At the end of this Ibid. p.
52.
Apology, there is an Epistle of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus the Emperor, to the
Senate of Rome, in favor of the Christians, reciting; That when he and his
Army in Germany, were surrounded with their Enemies, and like to be destroyed
by them, and for want of water, having not drunk any in 5. days space, ^e
thereupon sent for the Christians in his Army, of whom ^e found a great
multitude, and would have compelled them with threats to fight, which he ought
not to have done, because ^e afterward knew their force. Hereupon they
assaulted the Enemies, not with any preparation of weapons, nor of arms, or
trumpets; but casting themselves down upon the ground, (having God, as it
seems, shut up in their minds and Consciences voluntarily, though we call them
Atheists,) they not only prayed that for me, but also for this Army, they might
be removers of the Thirst and Famine, wherewith they were pressed. So soon as
they had c^st themselves down upon the ground, and had prayed to their God,
whom I knew no^, presently there fell showers of rain from Heaven, which were
most cold upon us; but upon the Enemies of the Romans there fell hayl in the
shape and likeness of fire. And it is also very likely God was presently at
hand in the midest of their Prayers, as invincible and indissoluble. Wherefore
beginning from thence, we may grant to such, that they may be Christians, lest
they should request and impetrate any arms of this kinds against us. Wherein
it is acknowledged by this Emperor, that all these Christian Soldiers, did in
this Extremity of danger, thirst and famine, pray for the Emperor and his
Armies safety and deliverance from their Enemies, though Pagans, and that God
instantly heard and answered their prayers, sending a comfortable rain to
refresh them, and raining hail, and fire, and thunderboults from Heaven on
their Enemies, which routed them without fighting; whereupon this Emperor
indulged them Liberty, to profess themselves Christians, without any
impeachment or molestation as formerly. Tertullian ad Scapulam lib. p. 165.
thus relates the story. Marcus quoque Aurelius in Germanica Expeditione,
Christianorum Militum Orationibus ad Deum factis, imbres in site illa
impetravit. And in his Apologeticus p. 588. Et nos e contrario edimus
Christianorum Protectorem, si literae M. Aurelii gravissimi Imperatoris
requirantur, quibus Germanicam sitim Christianorum forte Militum precationibus,
Impetrato imbri discussam contestatur. O^osius l. 7 c. 15. thus, Milites
Christiani sub M. Antonino merentes, pluviam in summa siccitate, and victoriam
in ultima prope desperatione, a Deo precatione sua Impotrarunt. Ea victoria
Marcomannicum bellum confecit, etc. Nicephorus Eccles. Hist. l. 4. c. 12.
relates the story at large: That the Christian Legion, kneeling down upon their
knees, and imploring the help of God, in their extreme thirst, danger and
necessity, when they were thus praying, God smote their Enemies, which pursued
them, with frequent thunderboults (whence they were afterward styled The
thundering Legion) and refreshed and revived the Emperors Army, with sweet and
pleasant showrs. Tam efficaces Scilicet nostrorum esse preces. Hanc rem profani
etiam Historici tradidere: as Apollinaris, and Julius Capitolinus in the life
of M. Antoninus.

Theophilus Antiochenus Patriarch of Antioch, flourishing about 180. years
after Christ, under the Emperors Marcus Anno 180.
Aurelius, and Commodus, in his Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 2. p. 158. D.
lib. 1. ad Autolichum, contra Christianae Religionis calumniatores, writes
thus concerning his and other Christians practice in honoring and praying for,
though not adoring the Pagan Roman Emperor and King. Honorabo Regem sive
Caesarem, non tamen adorabo, verum pro eo orabo. Deum qui vere verus Deus est
adorabo, sciens Caesarem ab ipso esse ordinatum. Rex enim sive Caesar Deus non
est, meminerit se esse hominem, a Deo esse in hanc dignitatem promotum non ut
adoretur, sed ut just, quemadmodum justitia exigit, judicet. Nam Regnum sive
Imperium, rerumque administratio ipsi a Deo commissa and demandata est. Regem
quidem sive Caesarem honora: honora, inquam, magna cum benevolentia, subjectus
ei existens et orans pro eo. Haec faciens, Dei voluntatem exequeris, nam
divinae legis hic tenor est; Honora fili mi Deum and Regem, et nunquam eorum
inobediens sis. Subito enim hosts suos ulcisci possunt. This was the loyal
Doctrine, practice of this Great Patriarch, and the primitive Church of
Antioch, (where the Disciples were first called Christians) to obey, honor, and
pray for their very Heathen King or Caesar, as set over them by God himself,
and that with cheerfulness and benevolence, as Duties specially commanded them
by the tenor of Gods word.

Irenaeus Bishop of Lions in France flourishing at the same Anno 180.
time, as he affirms, Adversus haereses, l. 4. c. 34. Est ergo Altar in
coelis, illuc enim preces nostrae dirigendae; so he asserts, lib. 5. p. 599,
600, 601. Non diabolus determinavit hujus seculi Regna, sed Deus, Regis enim
cor in manu Dei est: and per Solomonem ait verbum, Per me Reges regnant, etc.
which he likewise proves from Romans 13. 1, 2. whence he concludes, Ad utilitatem
ergo Gentilium, Terrenum Regnum positum est a Deo, sed non a Diabolo, (qui
nunquam quietus est, imo qui nec ipsos quidem Gentes vult in tranquillo agere)
ut timentes Regnum humanum, non se alterutrum homines vice piscium consumant,
sed per legum positiones repercutiant multiplicem Gentilium injustitiam. Et
secundum hoc ministri Dei sunt, qui tributa exigunt a nobis, in hoc ipsum
servientes quae sunt potestates, a Deo ordinatae sunt. Manifestum est, quoniam
mentitur Diabolus, di^ens, Mihi tradita sunt, and cui volo, do ea. Cujus enim
jussu homines nascuntur, hujus jussu et Reges constituuntur, apti his qui in
illo tempore ab ipsis regnantur. Quidam enim illorum ad correction^m and
utilitatem subjectorum dantur, and conservationem justitiae. Quidam autem ad
timorem and panam, and increpationem. Anno 190.
Therefore there is good reason for the Church and Christians to pray for them,
though Pagans and Persecutors

Athenagoras Atheniensis, a famous excellent Philosopher, in his most excellent
( Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 3. p. 129, 139, 140.
) Apologia, sive Legatio pro Christianis, dedicated by him to the Roman
Emperors, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and Aurelius Commodus, not only justifies
the loyalty, fidelity, and obsequiousness of all the Christians then living
under them, and Prayers for them, against all the malicious calumnies of their
Slanderers and Pagan enemies, worthy perusal, but likewise brings them in using
this constant form of Prayer to God for them, and their royal Posterity, and
their succession in the Empire after them, both in public and private. Nos
enim adeo vobis devoti addictique, pro Imperio vestro preces ad Deum fundimus,
et ut filius (quod justissimum est, let our Antimonarchists observe it) in
Regno olim Parenti succedat, utque Imperium vestrum magis magisque semper
augeatur. Denique, omnia ex animi sententia vobis eveniant oramus: quod and
nobis salutare fuerit, ut quietam tranquillamque vitam degentes, vobis interim
ad quaelibet Imperia prompti inserviamus. Grounding this their practice on the
1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. as an evangelical duty prescribed to them by God.

Tertullian flourishing about 200. years after Christ, is Anno 200.
very copious in justifying the loyalty of all the Christians in his Age, to
their very idolatrous persecuting Roman Emperors, together with their dutiful
subjection to and prayers unto God for all of them, against the malicious
accusations and complaints then made against them by their Enemies; I shall
transcribe two of his passages to this purpose ( Ad scapulam, lib. p. 162, 163.
) Sic and circa majestatem Imperatoris infamamur, tamen nunquam Albiniani, nec
Nigriani, vel Cassiani, (chief Conspirators and Traitors against their
Emperors) inveniri potuerunt Christiani; sed iidem ipsi qui per genios eorum in
pridie usquam juraverunt, qui pro salute eorum hostias et fecerunt, et
voverunt; qui Christianos saepe damnarunt, hosts eorum sunt reperti.
Christianus nullius est hostis, nedum Imperatoris, quem sciens a Deo suo
constitui, necesse est ut et ipsum diligat, et revereatur et honoret, et salvum
velit cum toto Romano Imperio, quousque seculum stabit, tamdiu enim stabit.
(Therefore they never attempted the deposition of the Emperor, nor change of
the Imperial Government, though Pagan:) colimus ergo er Imperatorem sic,
quomodo et nobis licet, et ipsi expedit, ut hominem a Deo secundum: and
quicquid est, a Deo consecutum solo Deo minorem. Sic enim omnibus major est dum
solo Deo vero minor est Sic and ipsis Diis major est, dum and ipsi in potestate
sunt ejus. Itaque et sacrificamus pro salute Imp: sed Deo nostro et ipsius; sed
quomodo praecepit Deus, pura prece; Ita nos oramus magis pro salute
Imperatoris, ab eo came postulantes qui praestare potest. His passages in his
Apologia adversus Gentes are most full: where he thus writes and refutes the
Gentiles objections of this kind against the Christians. Ventum est ad secundum
titulum h Apologia, c. 30, ^ c. Cent. Magd. 3. c 3. col. 11. See 1. a Cerda,

quia Imperatoribus neque ^anos, neque mentientes, neque temerarios honores
dicant, quia verae Religionis homines solemnia eorum conscientia potius quam
lascivia celebrant, etc. To which he returns this Answer, fully clearing the
loyalty of the Christians to their persecuting Pagan Emperors, and constant
prayers for them. Insuper eos (...) qui salutem Imperatorum sciunt petere, qui

(licet extranei a turbis aestimemur) in aliquo loco invenimur. Est et alia
major necessitas nobis orandi pro Imperatoribus, etiam pro omni statu Imperii,
rebusque Romany, quod vim maximam universo orbi immin^ntem, ipsamque clausuram
seculi acerbitates horrendas comminantem, Romani Imperii commeatu scimus
retardari. Itaque nolumus experiri, et dum precamur differri, Romanae
diuturnitati favemus. Sed quid ego amplius de Religione et Pietate christiana
in Imperatorem? quem necesse est suspiciamus, ut eum quem Dominus noster
elegerit. ut merito dixerim, nosterest magis Caesar, ut a nostro Deo
constitutus: itaque ut plus meo, plus ego illi operorinsalutem. etc. Iidem
sumus Imperatoribus qui and vicinis nostris. Male enim velle, male facere, male
dicere, male cogitare de quoquam ex aequo vetamur. Quodcunque non licet in
Imperatorem, id nec in quemquam: quod in neminem, for sitan magis nec in ipsum,
qui per Deum tantus est. Si inimicos (ut supra diximus) jubemur diligere, quem
habebimus odisse? item si laeso vicem refer prohibemur, ne de facto pares
simus, quem possumus laedere? etc.

After which relating the manner of the Christians publicks Assemblies, he
adds. Coimns in coetum and congregationem, ut ad Deum, quasi manu facta
Precationibus ambiamus orantes. Haec vis Deo grata est. Oramus etiam pro
Imperatoribus, pro Ministris eorum, et Potestatibus seculi, pro rerum quiet,
pro mora finis, etc. And for their faithful paying of Tribute to the Emperors
without fraud, he subjoyns. Sed caetera vectigalia gratias Christianis agunt ex
fide dependentilus debitum, qua alieno fraudando abstinemus, ut si ineatur
quantum vectigalibus pereat fraud and mendacio vestrarum prosessionum, facile
ratio haberi possit unius speciei querela compensata pro commodo caeterarum
rationum. Now that the primitive Christians were not thus loyal to their Pagan
persecuting Emperors, and prayed for them, from any base carnal fear, flattery,
or want of power to resist them by force of Arms, but merely out of conscience
and duty toward Gods commands, is evident by the premises; and Tertullians
express words, who informs us, that the Christians then were so numerous and
potent, That they wanted neither number, nor power to resist and avenge their
enemies, if they pleased, and could easily do it in one night, being See Plinii
Epist. l. 10. Epist. 97.
more in number than the Mauritanians, Marcomanni, or Parthians, or any one
Nation of the world, confined but to one Country, having then overspread the
world itself. Externi sumus and vestra omnia (...), urbes, insulas, castella,
municipia, conciliabula, castra ipsa, tribus, decurias, palatium, forum; sola
vobis relinquimus templa. Cui bello non idonei, non prompti fuissemus, etiam
impares copiis, qui tam libenter trucidamur? Si non apud istam disciplinam,
magis occidi liceret, quam occidere. Potuimus et inermes, nec rebels, sed
tantummodo discordes, solius divortii invidia adversus vos dimicasse. And the
forecited Letter of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (p. 50.) imports as much.

How then should this dutiful subjection, loyalty, these frequent fervent
prayers of the primitive Christians, for the life, safety, continuance of the
Government, Empire of their very persecuting Pagan Roman Emperors, in
conscientious obedience to Gods commands, and out of these grounds of Christian
policy, for their own safety, tranquillity, and the public good; condemn the
transcendent disloyalty, treachery, rebellions, antimonarchical conspiracies,
practices, prayers, humiliations of many degenerated Saints, and Apostates in
our Age, against their lawful hereditary Christian Kings, and their Kingly
Government; who upon the serious consideration of these premises, must either
execrate, renounce, reform these their unchristian, antichristian practices, or
else confess themselves to be no true, nor real Christians?

militiam pro Republica caedesque hominum nos vrgentibus. Ecce vestrum quoque
numinum Sacerdotes and delubrorum custodes dextras servant puras a sanguine

solenniter iis, quos habetis pro Diis, nec ullo bello delectos habetis e
sacrificorum ordine. Hujus moris si vobis constat ratio, quanto magis caeteris

pugnamus pro Imperatore, and licet cum ipso non militemus, habemus tamen castra
propria pietatis auspiciis, et rem deprecationibus gerimus. Quod si Celsus
jubet nos etiam praefecturis militaribus fungi pro patria. Sciat nos hoe quoque

reliquis hominibus, dum cives erudiunt ad pietatem erga Deum tutelarem patriae

for neglecting this Christian duty for our christian Protestant Kings and
Kingdoms?

St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage (who was martyred Anno 240.
in the 8. persecution, under the Emperors Valerianus and Galienus, Anno 248.)
in his elegant Book Ad Demetrianum Proconsul of Afric, who imputed all the
wars, famins, wherewith the world was then afflicted, to the Christians, writes
thus of the Christians prayers for and loyalty to their persecuting Emperors
and Superiors. Edit. Pam. 1617. p. 166.
Nos qui exposita nativitate terrena, spiritu recreati and renati sumus, nec
jam mundo, sed Deo vivimus, non nisi cum ad Deum venerimus, Dei munera and
promissa capiemus: Et tamen pro arcendis hostibus, et preces fundimus; et pro
pace ac salute vestra, propitiantes ac placantes diebus ac noctibus ^ugiter
atque instanter oramus. On which passage, Pamelius has this observation. Locus
insignis pro antiquitate precum Ecclesticarum communium; qualis est etiam in
Tertul. and Justin. Apologiis. Repe^iuntur hujusmodi preces in Litnrgiis etiam
Jacobi, Clementis, Basilii, Chrysostomi. That the Christians then prayed for
their very Enemies and Persecutors, according to Christ's injunction, St.
Cyprian expressly asserts in his Book, De bono Patientiae, p. ^84. b. De Zelo
and Livore, p. 191. a. Testim. l. 3. ad Quirinum, Sect 49. p. 221.

Eusebius. Eccl. Hist. l 7. c. 10. Centur. Magd. 3. c. 4. col. 61.
Dionysius, and oath rChristians, convented before Emillianus Anno 260.
the Governor under the Pagan Emperor Valerianus, Anno 260. as if, they were
enemies to the Emperors, and prayed not to God for them and the Empire, gave
him this Answer. Nos omnes Deum, Deum omni^m Gubernatorem, qui Valeriano and
Galieno Caesaribus Imperium largitus est, et colimus, et veneramur. Huic e^iam
sine intermissione pro eorum Regno, ut st^bile et firmum man^at, preces
adhibemus. And can any Christians think they do either God or their Country
good service, in giving over praying thus for their Christian Kings and
Kingdoms, and maintaining and continuing them both together?

Arnobius a Christian Philosopher and Rhetorician flourishing Anno 300.
about the year of Christ 300. under persecuting Pagan Emperors, in his
Disputationum adversus Gentes, l. 4. Antuerpiae, 1582. p. 148, 150. writes
thus, Majestatis sunt apud vos rei, qui de vestris secus obmurmuraverint
Regibus. Magistratum in ordinem redigere, Senatorem aut convitio prosequi suis
esse decrestis periculosissimum paenis, etc. Soli sunt apud vos Superi

Constantine the Great, a Godly and devout Christian Woman being taken Captive
by the Iberians, dwelling nigh the Euxine Sea, then Idolators and Barbarians,
gave herself to continency, fasting and fervent prayer, during her Captivity,
the Kings S^n of very tender years, fell into a dangerous disease, whereof none
to whom he was carried could cure him: at last they brought him to this
Christian Captive; who in the presence of many Women, without applying any
salve or medicine, laid her Sackcloath upon him, and said only these words,
Christ which heals many, will also heal this Infant. When she had uttered
these words, And also prayed unto God for aid and assistance to heal and cure
the Disease, the Child forthwith recovered and enjoyed perfect health. The fame
of which cure being bruited amongst the Barbarians Wives, came at last to the
Queens ears, so that she was very famous. A while after, the Queen herself fell
sick, and this simple woman was sent for, who refused to go, for fear some
violence should be offered to her. Thereupon the Queen being conveyed to her,
she practiced, and prayed to God for her recovery, as she had done before for
the Child, and forthwith the Queen is rid of her disease. Whereupon she thanketh
the woman: who answered, It is not my doing, but Christ's the Son of God, the
maker of heaven and earth; exhorting the Queen to call upon him, and to worship
the true God. The King hearing of this strange cure, commanded the Captive
woman should be bountifully rewarded; Who sending back his rewards, said, she
wanted no riches, but esteemed Godliness the greatest treasure, and that the
King should receive a precious Jewel, if he would acknowledge that God with she
professed: Whereupon the King and his Queen long instructed by her in the
Christian Faith, called all his Subjects together by Proclamation, to whom he
rehearsed the manner of his Sons and Queens cure by this Captives prayers, and
what happened to himself in hunting by praying to her God: then they preached
Christ to both Sexes, the King to men, and the Queen to women, after that built
a house of Prayer, turned Christians, and sent Ambassadors to Constantine, for
a Bishop and Clergymen to instruct them further in the Faith, protesting their
further belief in Christ: as the marginal Historians more at large relate. Here
we have a Captive Christian by her Prayers, healing the Kings Son, and Queen of
incurable Diseases, under whom she was a Captive, and converting the King,
Queen, and all his Subjects to the Christian Faith by her Prayers, and the
miraculous cures wrought by them, and Christ's power concurring with her
prayers: a strong obligation for Christians to practice the Apostles precept, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. even for Pagan persecuting King^ and Princes, much more for
Christian, under whom (...) live not as Captives, but natural born Subjects.

St. Amorose, Hierom, S^dulius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Primasius, ^ ^ ^. pa^s
3. 93^.
Remigius Bishop of Rhemes, Beda, Rabanus Maurus, Haymo Halberstatensis,
Oe^umenius, Theophylact, and all Ancients in their expositions and commentaries
on the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. with all modern Expositors on this Text, and St.
Augustine, De civitate dei, lib. 19. c. 26. resolve, That Christians ought to
pray publicly and privately to God for the life, safety, prosperity of Pagan
and persecuting Kings, Princes, Governors, Rulers, as well as those who are
Christians, by the Apostles precept; he being inspired with the same Spirit as
the Prophet Jeremy and Baruch was, Ier. 23. 7.
who sent an Epistle to the Captive Jews in Babylon, to pray unto the Lord for
the life of King Nebuchadonozer, and of his Sons, and for the peace of the
City, to which they were carried Captives, because in the peace thereof they
should have peace. And that upon the same ground, the Servants of God ought to
pray unto him for the lives of their Kings, Princes, and their Sons, and the
peace of their Realms, though Pagans, that they may the more freely serve God,
and lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, which they
cannot do in times of war and persecution.

If then this was the constant doctrine, practice, duty of all the primitive
Christians, Bishops, Ministers, Fathers of the Church, under their worst,
bloodiest persecuting Pagan and idolatrous Emperors, Kings, Princes, thus
constantly to make supplications^ prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving unto
God for them, and to be most dutiful, loyal, and submissive to them, without
the least rebellion, insurrection, or treachery against them, as all these
Fathers clearly manifest; then much more ought it to be so under their own
lawful hereditary Christian Kings and Princes, for which I shall produce some
notable presidents in former ages, after Emperors and Kings became Christians,
and embraced the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in the 6. and 7. Chapters, reserved
for a second part.

CHAP. V.
BEfore I proceed to the practice of the Primitive Christians, and their
successors in all Empires, Kingdoms, in praying, interceding, supplicating and
giving thanks to God for their Emperors, Kings, and their royal Progeny,
whether Orthodox or Heterodox, after they became Christians, I thought fit to
subjoyn the practice even of Pagan Idolatrous Subjects, in praying and
sacrificing to their Idol Gods, for the long life, prosperity, happy reigns and
succession of their Pagan Idolatrous Kings and Emperors, and their posterity
over them, both at their solemn inaugurations, their ordinary Addresses to
them, and upon other occasions, and that as well for vicious, tyrannical,
oppressive Kings and Emperors, as those who were most just, gracious, good,
bountiful and beneficial to the public.

I have hinted before, p. 14. That the Israelites borrowed their acclamations
to, and prayers for their first King Saul, at his inauguration to the Kingdom,
from the Heathen Nations round about them, who used to cry, God save the King;
O King live for ever, at their Coronations, and addresses to them; and likewise
to offer sacrifices, and prayers to their Gods for them and their Sons, as is
evident by Ezra 6. 9, 10. c. 7. 21, 22, 23. compared with Jer. 29. 7. Baruck 1.
10, 11, 12. which I formerly insisted on. To which I shall add, Dan. 2. 4.
Where King Nebuchadnezzar sending for all the Magicians, Astrologers,
Sorcerers, and Caldeans, to interpret his dream; when they came and stood
before the King, and heard his demand, they spoke thus to the King in Syriack,
O King live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the
interpretation. Dan. 3. 8, 9. When King Nebuchadnezzar after this had erected a
golden Image, and commanded all to fall down and worship it, under pain of
being cast into the midst of a fiery furnace: Certain Caldeans came near and
accused the Jews before the King, for not worshipping his Gods, and the Golden
Image he had set up, which accusation they thus prefaced; They spoke and said
to the King Nebuchadnezzar: O King live for ever: Dan. 5. 10. When King
Belshazzar was very much terrified with the handwriting in the wall, in the
midst of his impious feast, which none of his Astrologers, Magicians,
South-sayers and wise men could read or interpret, the Queen thereupon came
into the Banquethouse, and spoke and said: O King live for ever, let not thy
thoughts trouble thee, nor let not thy countenance be changed, etc. So Dan. 6.
6. when the Presidents of the Kingdoms, Princes, Governors, Counselors and
Captains of King Darius, conspired against Daniel, and urged him to make an
impious royal Statute; that whosoever shall ask a Petition of any God or man,
for thirty days, save only of thee, O King, he shall be cast into the den of
Lions; these Presidents and Princes assembled together to the King, and said
thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. And v. 20, 21. When the King came to
the Lions den, after Daniel was cast into it, to inquire of his safety: Then
said Daniel unto the King: O King live for ever. From all which texts it is
irrefragable, that it was the constant practice of the Persians, Babylonians,
Assyrians and Caldeans, and of all their Princes, Governors, Officers,
Astrologers, South-sayers Queens, Wisemen, Courtiers, Subjects, People in all
their addresses and speeches to their Kings, to use this salutation to, and
prayer for them, O King live for ever; and therefore much more to pray thus for
them in their Temples, and to use this acclamation and the like, at all their
Coronations and public triumphs. Hence Theodoret in his Interpretation on Dan.
5. 10. on these words, Rex in saecula, or, in aeternum vive: thus comments:
Haec autem er at praefatio, qua subjecti Kegibus e^s ^unc salutabant, et ad hoc
usque tempus hic mos invaluit: Quidam enim imperiti, Reges eos qui nunc sunt,
ae^ernos vocare consueverunt; in syngraphis quoque commerciorum hoc quidam
ascribunt, stultitiae magis quam impietatis damnandi. And on Dan. 6 21. He
adds, Usitatam praefationem (Daniel) suis ser monibus praeponit, videlieet,
liceat tibi (...) diui^me vivere: Etenim in praesenti eti^m (...) Reges in
commerciorum scriptu^ is quida^ appellare cons^everunt. Junius, C^lvin and
others on Dan. 2 and 3. and 5. and 6. observe that, O King live for ever, was a
common salutation, and p^ayer, used amongst the Cald^ans; for fu^ther proof
whereof, I shall only add one memorable president which Aelianus, Variae Hist.
l. 3. c. 32. records, It being the cnstom of the Persians always to present
their Kings with gifts when they traveled abroad, a certain Persian named
Sinaeta, meeting King Artaxerxes Mnemon far from his House, being much troubled
in mind, that he had nothing to present him with, according to the law and
custom of the Persians; he thereupon ran to the river Cyru^, and taking up a
little water in the palms of his hands, came and presented it to the King,
saying, O King Artaxerxes live for ever, O Rex Artaxerxes regnes in ae^rnum,
Nunc te prout poss^m, and quomodo possum, te munere dono, ut non indonatus,
quantum ad me attinct, and quantum in me est, praetereas. Honoro autem te Cyri
aquis, etc. Wherewith the King being greatly delighted, sent him an honorable
and rich reward.

To pass from the Persians, Babylonians, and Chaldeans to the Romans.

It is evident by the Testimonies of sundry ( Tacitus, Aelius Lamprid. Flavius
Vopiscus, Eutropius, Aelius spartianus, Josephus, Suetonius, Dion Cassius,
Grimstons Imperial History, p 15. 41. T^tull. ad Scapnlam and Apolog Ar nobius
ad^ersus Gentes, Cent. Magd. 1, 2, 3, 4 c 15. de Gentilisimo: La Cerda
Annotationes in Tertulliani Apologiam.
) Historians and Fathers, that the Idolatrous Pagan Romans did not only erect
Altars, Temple^, and Statues to Julius Caesar, Augustus, Heliogabalus, and
others of their Pagan Emperors (whereas Tyberius only prohibited the Senate to
build any Temple for him) and likewise swear by their Names, Altars, Genius,
and offer Oblations to them, as if they were Gods, which was most palpable
flattery and idolatry: but also prayed and offered Vows and Sacrifices to their
Gods for their welfare and prosperity; which was but loyalty and their bounden
duty.

I shall present you with some few instances of special Vows, Acclamations,
and prayers for them, instead of many more which might be added.

The wanton Poet Ovid, banished into Pontus for his lascivious Love-Poems by
Augustus Caesar, prayed thus for his long life and prosperity during his very
exile under his Imperial indignation.

Suetonius Tranquil'us in the life of the Emperor Augustus Caesar, c. 57, 58,
59, 60. thus relates the extraordinary acclamations, g^lations, thanksgivings,
prayers and snpplications of the People, Senate, and Provinces for Aug^stus the
Emperor (under whose Government Christ was born.) Pro quibus (...) quantopere

Caesareas urbes condiderunt, and cuncti simul aedem Jovis Olympici, Athenis
antiquitus inchoatam, perficere communi sumptu destinaverunt, GENIOQUE EJUS
DEDICARE. Such was their Devotion, Loyalty and Affection toward him.

( Annal. l. 4. c. 3. see Alexander ab Alexandro Genesis Dierum, l. 3. ^. 22.
) Cornelius Tacitus records, Anno ab urbe condita, 777. Pontifices, eorumque
exemplo caeteri Sacerdotes, cnm pro incolnmitate Principis vota susciperent,
Neronem quoque and Drusium Iisdem Diis commendavere, non tam caritate juvenum,
quam adulatione. Which Tyberius the Emperor took very ill, as equallizing these
youngsters to himself who was aged, and checked the high Priests for it. Not
long after, the ( Ibid e. 5.
) furthest parts of Spain, sent Messengers to the Senate, to desire leave to
build a Temple to Tyberius, as Asia had done. Whereupon he made a speech in the
Senate, refusing this address and adoration, concluding his oration in these
words, Proinde socios, cives, et De^s, et Deas ipsas precor hoc, ut mihi usque
finem vitae, quietam et Intelligentem humani Divinique juris mentem duint;
illos, ut quandocunque conc^ss^ro, cum laud and bonis recordationibus, facta
atque famam nominis mei prosequantur. In lib. 4. Hist. c. 3. Tacitus brings in
Marcellus, thus speaking in the Senate: se meminisse temporum quibus natus est,
quam civitatis formam patres avique constituerint, ulteriora mirari, praesentia
sequi, vonos Imperatores voto expetere, qualescunque tolerare. And Annalium l.
16. c. 6. he records; that Thraseus Peto a Noble Senator, was accused, and
afterward adjudged to death by the Tyrant Nero; amongst other things objected
against him by Capito; Principio anni vitare Thraseum jusjurandum solenne,
nuncupationibus Uotorum non adesse (for the Emperors life, health and
prosperity) quamvis Quindecim virali Sacerdotio praeditum: nunquam pro salute
Principis, aut caelesti voce immolavisse. His daughter being produced and
interrogated to give in evidence against him, answered, Nullos (inquit) Impios
Deos, nullas Devotiones, nec aliud infelicibus precibus invocavi, quam ut hunc
optimum Patrem tu Caesar, et vos patres servaretis incolumem: On which
Passages, Lipsius in his Commentary, p. 298. and in Excursu. p. 540, 541.

Caius Caligula, being elected Emperor, and entering Rome, was received, Tanta
publica laetitia, ut tribus proximis mensibus, ac ne totis quidem, supra
sexaginta millia victimarum caesa tradantur, to the Gods for his happiness and
prosperity, Cum deinde paucos post dies in proximas Campaniae Insulas
trajecisset, Uota pro reditu suscepta sunt: ne minimam quidem occasionem
quoquam omittente in testificanda solicitudine et cura de incolumitate ejus: ut
vero in adversam valetudinem incidit, pernoctantibus cunctis circa Palatium,

When this Emperor Claudius was poisoned and very sick; Vocabatur interim
Senatus, Uotaque pro incolumitate Principis, Consules et Sacerdotes
nuncupabant, as Annalium l. 13. Sect. 14.
Cornelius Tacitus relates.

The Emperor Claudius Nero, succeeded Caligula in the Empire, whose ( Grimstons
Imperial History, p. 62.
) beginnings were so just, wise, mild, as all men said, that a God was sent
from heaven to govern Rome: but degenerating at la^t into a Monster of Vice and
Tyranny, among others, he banished his incomparable Tutor Seneca, and used him
very ungratefully, who notwithstanding in his Book, De Consolatione ad
Polybium, cap. 28. 31, 32 makes this honorable mention of, and prayer for him
and his progeny. Superstitem Caesarem omnemque ejus prolem, superstitem te cum
omnibus habes fratribus. Non desinam totiens tibi ^ffere Caesarem. Illo
m^derante terras, and ostendente, quanto melius beneficiis imperium

In this passage which I have at large transcribed, we have a most excellent
Prayer of Seneca, even while he was in exile under Nero to all the Gods and
Goddesses, for his long life, happiness, prosperity, and his families too: the
hereditary succession of his Son after him, the happiness of his Government,
the peace and enlargement of his Empire, and triumph over his enemies: together
with a large Encomium of his clemency and his Princely virtues toward others,
and a benign interpretation of his severity toward himself: so as we might
hereby conjecture, what some write of him to be a truth; that he had read Paul's
Epistles, (especially the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2 3. Tit. 3. 1. Romans 13. he putting them
here in practice) and that there passed Epistles between Paul and him. There
are some other passages in his works, wherein he makes short Vincat mortalia
tempora vitae. Ludus de morte Claudii Caesaris.
ejaculatory Prayers for Nero, which I shall pretermit, this being the most
observable and pathetical. Only I shall insert one memorable Discourse of his,
d^claring the grounds and reasons why Subjects ought not only to pray for their
Kings, but to honor, love, yea hazard all their lives for their safety and
defense upon all occasions, to set home the natural Equity and Justice of this
duty of constant, fervent, public and private Supplications, Prayers,
Intercessions and Thanksgivings unto God for them. De Clementia, lib. 1.
(dedicated to the Emp. Nero) c. 3, 4. See ^. Lipsii Dissertatiu^cula. thereon.
Illius demum Principis magnitudo stabilis fundataque est, quem omnes tam supra
se esse, quam pro se sciunt: cujus curam excubare pro salute singulorum atque
universorum cottidie experiuntur; quo procedentenon tanquam malum aliquod aut
noxium animal e cubili prosilierit, diffugiunt; sed tanquam ad clarum ac
beneficum sidus certatim advolant, objicere se pro illo mucronibus insidiantium
paratissimi, et substernere corpora sua, si per stragem illi humanam iter ad
salutem sternendum sit. Somnum ejus nocturnis excubiis muniunt, latera objecti
circumfusique defendunt, incurrentibus periculis se opponunt: Neque hic est
sine ratione populis urbibusque consensus sic protegendi amandique Reges et se
suaque jactandi quocunque desideraverit imperantis salus. Nec haec vilitas sui
est, aut dementia, pro uno capite tot millia excipere serrum, ac multis
mortibus unam animam redimere, (...) senis et invalidi. Quemadmodum totum
corpus animo deservit, and cum hoc tanto majus, tantoque speciosus fit, ille in
occulto ^aneat tenuis, and in qua sede latitet incertus; tamen manus, pedes,
oculi negotium illi gerunt: illum haec cutis munit, illius jussu jacemus, aut
inquieti discur^imus; cum ille imperavit, sive avarus Dominus est, mare lucri
caussa scrutamur; sive ambitiosus, jamdud^m dexteram fiammis objecimus, aut
voluntary subsiluimus; Sic haec immensa multitudo, unius anima circumdata,
illius spiritu regitur, illius ratione (...), pressura se ac ^ractura viribus
suis, nisi consilio sustineretur. Suam itaque incolumitatem amant, cum pro uno
homine denas legiones in aciem ducunt, cum in prima front procurrunt, et
adversa vulneribus pectora feriunt, ne Imperatoris sui signa vertantur Ille est
enim vinculum per quod Respublica coh^ret; Ille spiritus vitalis quem haec tot
millia trahunt; nihil ipsa per se futura, nisi onus et praeda, si men's illa
Imperii subtrahatur. -- Rege incolumi men's omnibus una, Amisso rupere fidem.
Virgil-Geor. lib. 2.


Hic casus Romani populi exitium erit, hic tanti fortunam populi in ruinas

multas dissiliet; Idemque huic Urbi dominandi finis erit, qui parendi fuerit.
Ideo Principes, Regesque, et quocunque alio nomine sunt Tutores status publici,
non est mirum amari ultra privatas (...) necessitudines: Nam si sanis hominibns
publica privatis potiora sunt; sequitur, ut is quoque carior sit in quem se
Respublica convertit. Ollm enim ita se induit Reipublicae Caesar, ut didu^i
a^terum non possit, sine utriusque pernic^e: nam ut illi viribus opus est, ita
et huic capiti. All which we have found true by sad experience. He adds, c.
19. Quid pulchri^s est (^egi) quam vivere optantibus cunctis, et vota non sub
custode nuncupantibus? Si paulo valetudo titubavit, non spem hominum excitari,
sed metum. Nihil est cuiquam tam pretiosum, quod non pro salute Praesidis sui
commutatum velit? Omne quod illi continget, fibi quoque evenire deputet? And
should not Christians, Protestants, and our three distressed, distracted
Protestant Kingdoms, Nations, Churches, upon these very grounds and reasons,
show as much cordial affection, loyalty, duty to their undoubted Christian
Protestant Kings and Princes, as these Pagans did to their Heathen Kings and
Emperors? yea shall they not rise up in judgment against them before all
Tribunals of God and men, if they do it not? Con^ider well of it, and declare
your judgments herein.

When the Emperor Titus was sick. (...) (...), c. 8. 11.
Medendae valetudini leniendisque morbis, NULLAM DIVINAM humanamque opem non
adhibuit, INQUISITO OMNE SACRIFICIORUM remediorumque GENERE; the priests and
people praying and sacrificing for his health. When his death was known: non
secus atque in domestico luctu MAeRENTIBUS PUBLIC CUNCTIS, Senatus prius quam
edicto convocatus, ad Curiam cucurrit; obseratisque adhuc foribus, deinde
apertis, Tantas mortuo gratias egit laudesque, quantas congessit ne vivo quidem
unquam atque praesenti.

The Heathen Epigramatist and Poet Martial, flourishing under the Pagan
Emperors, Domitian and Trajan, (to whom he inscribes many of his Epigrams) has
these prayers for them. l. 4. Epig. 1. De Natali Domitiani.

Caesaris alma dies, et luce sacratior illa,
Conscia Dictaeum, qua tulit Ida Jovem.
Longa precor, Pyleoque veni numerosior aevo,

Hic colat Albano Tritonida cultus in auro,
Perque manus tantas plurima quercus eat,
Hic colat ingenti Redeuntia secula lustro,
Et quae Romuleus sac^a Terentus habet.

Pro tanto quae sunt improba vota Deo?
Epig. l. 7. Epig. 51. ad Jovem.

He begins his dedication of his 8. Book, to Domitia^ thus. Imperatori
Domitiano Caesa^i, Augusto, Germanico, Dacico, Valerius Martialis, salutem. And
Epig. l. 10. Epig. 32. ad Trajanum. he prays thus for him,

Et rata perpetuo quae tribuere, velint.
Qui^sua restituis spoliato jura patrono, etc.
Epig. l. 11. Epig. 4. Precatur Deos pro Nerva Trajano, in this form.

C. Plini^s secundus, in his Epistles and Panegyric to the Emperor Trajan,
has many excellent Prayers, Vows, Supplications, Gratulations, and
thanksgivings to the Gods for his long life, health, prosperity, Government,
Empire, in his own, the Senates, Soldiers, and Provinces names, which are very
pertinent and observable. Epistolarum l. 10. Epist. 1. C. Plinius, Trajano
Imperatori Salutem (the usual inscription of all his Epistles to him) he prays
thus for him. Prec^r ^rgo ut tibi et per te generi humano prospera omnia, id
est digna seculo tuo, contingant: Fortem te et hilar^m Imperator optime, et
privatim et public opto. Lib. 10. Epist: 44. C. Plin. Tra. Imp. Salutem,
Solemnia vota pro Incolumi^ate tua, qua publica salus continetur, et
suscipimus. Domine, pariter et solvimus; precati Deos, ut velint ea semper
solvi, semperque signari. To which Trajan returned this Answer, Epist. 45. Et
soluisse vos cum provincialibus Diis Immortalibus vota, pro mea salute et
incolumitate nuncupasse, liventer, mi Secunde charissime, cognovi ex literis
tuis, Epist. 60. he thus mentions the public joy and prayers made for him, and
the Oath of Allegiance sworn to him, both by the Soldiers, and people on the
day of his inauguration. Diem, Domine, quo servasti Imperium, dum suscipis,
quanta mereris lae^itia celebravimus, precati Deos, ut te generi humano, cujus
tutela and securitas saluti tuae invisa est, incolumem florentemque
praestarent. Praebu^us.
Praeiimus and commilitonibus jusjurandum more solenni praesrantibus, et
provincialibus, qui eadem certarunt pietate, juvantibus. To which the Emperor
returns this answer. Epist. 61. Quanta Religione ac laetitia commilitones cum
provincialibus to praeennte, diem Imperii mei celebraverint libenter mi Secunde
charissime, cognovi literis tuis. Epist. 89. Opto Domine et hunc natalem, et
plurimes alios quam felicissimos agas, aeternaque laud florentem virtutis tuae
gloriam, et Incolumis et fortis aliis super a^ta operibus Augeas. To which
Trajan returned th^s answer to Pliny Epist. 90. Agnosco vota tua mi Secunde
charissime, quibus precaris, ut plurimos et felicissimos natales, florente
statu Reip. nostrae, agam. Epist. 101. C. Plin. Tr. Imp. S. Uota, Domine,
priorum annorum nuncupata, alacres, laetique persolvimus, novaque rursus,

remque ^ublicam florentem et Incolumem ea benignitate servarent, quam super
magnas plurimasque virtutes praecipua sanctitate consequi Deorum Honor
meruisti. Which Trajan thus answers, Epist. 102. Solvisse vota Di^s
Immortalibus, te praeeunte, pro mea Incolumitate, et commilitones cum
provincialibus laetissimo consensu, in futu^mque nuncupasse, libenter, mi
Secunde charissime, cognovi literis tuis.

In his A^rpiae, Cum (...) Li^si perpe^ Co^entario, (...) 1600, p. 1^, 21, 25,

Panegyricus Trajano dictus, by the Senates command, he begins thus. Been ac
sapienter Patres Conscripti, majores instituerunt, ut rerum agendarum, ita
dicendi initium, (...) precationibus capere: qnod nihil rite, nihilque
providenter homines, sine Deorum immortalium open, consilio, honor,
auspicarentur. Qui mos, cui potius, quam Consuli? aut quando magis usurpandus,
colendusque est, quam cum imperio Senatus, auctoritate Reip: ad agendas optimo
Principi gratias excitamur? Quod enim praestabilius est, aut pulchrius munus
Deorum, quam castus, et sanctus, et Diis simillimus Princeps? Ac si adhuc
dubium fuisset, forte, casuque Rectores terris, an aliquo Numine darentur,
Principem tamen nostrum liqueret divinitus constitutum. Non enim occulta
potestate fatorum, sed ab ipso Jove coram ac palam repertus, electus est,
quippe inter aras et alta^ia, eodemque loci, quem Deus ille tam manifestus ac
praesens, quam coelum et sydera insedit. Quo magis aptum piumque est, te
Iuppiter Optime maxim, antea conditorem, nunc conservatorem Imperii nostri,
precari, ut mihi digna Con^ule, digna Senatu, digna Principe contingat Oration:
utque omnibus, quae dicentur a me, libertas, fides, veritas, constet. Talem,
non bella civilia, ^ec armis oppressa R. P. sed pax, et adoptio, et tandem
exorata terris Numina, dedissent. Confugit in sinum, ^um concussa Respub:
ruensque Imperium super Imperatorem, Imperatoris tibi voce delatum est, etc.
Nec judicium hominum, sed Deorum etiam in confilium assumpsit, Itaque non tua
in cubiculo, sed In Templo, nec ante genialem torum, sed ante pulvina^ Iovis
Opt. Max. adoptio peracta est: qua tandem non servitus nostra, sed libertas, et
salus, et ^securitas fundabatur. Sibi enim Dii gloriam illam vindica verunt:
Horum opus, horum illud Imperium; Nerva tantum Minister fuit, etc. Ergo non
aetas quemquam, non valetudo, non sexus retardavit, quo minus oculos insolito
spectaculo impleret. Te parvuli noscere, ostentare juvenes, mirari senes; aegri
quoque neglecti medentium imperio, ad conspectum tui, quasi ad salutem
sanitatemque prorepere. Inde alii se satis vixisse te viso, te recepto; alii
nunc magis esse vivendum, praedicabant. Feminas etiam tunc foecunditatis suae
maxima voluptas subiit, cum cernerent cui Principi cives, cui Imperatori
milites peperissent. Videres referta tecta, ac laborantia, ac ne eum quidem
vacantem locum, qui non nisi suspensum et instabile vestigium caperet; oppletas
undique vias angustamque tramitem relictum tibi; alacrem hinc atque inde
populum: Ubique par Gaudium, paremque clamorem: Tam aequalis ab omnibus ex
adventu tuo laetitia accepta est, quam omnibus venisti: quae tamen ipsa cum
ingressu tuo crevit, a^ prope in singu^os gradus adaucta est. Gratum erat
cunctis, quod Senatum osculo exciperes, ut dimissus osculo fueras, etc. Quae
cirumstantium gaudia? quam recens clamor? quam similis illi dies, qui hanc
genuit diem? Ut plena Altaribus, augusta victimis cuncta? ut in unius salutem
collata omnium vota? cum sibi se et liberis suis intelligerent precari, quae
pro te precarentur, etc. Dent tibi Caesar aetatem Dii, quam mereris, serventque
animum quem dederunt. Quae ubique feruntur, quaeque expetuntur, omnes gentes
invicem capiant and discant, quanto liberate discordi servientibus sit
utilius, unum esse, cui serviant. Quippe discretis quidem bonis omnium, sua
cujusque ad singulos mala: sociatis autem atque permixtis, singulorum mala ad
neminem, ad omnes omnia bona pertinent, etc. Simili reverentia Caesar, non apud
Genium tuum bonitati tuae, gratias agere, sed apud numen Iovi Opt. Max.
pateris: illi debere Nos qufcquid debeamus, illius quod be^e facias muneris
esse, quite dedit. Ibidem, p. 131, 132.
etc: Nuncupare Vota, et pro ae^ernitate Imperii, et pro salute Civium, imo pro
salute Principum, a^ propter illos pro aeternitate Amperii solebamus. Haec pro
Imperio nostro, in quae sint verba suscepta, operae pretium est, adnotare: Si
been Remp. et ex utilitate omnium rexeris. Digna vota quae semper suscipiantur,
semperque solvantur. Egit cum Diis, ipse te auctore Caesar Resp: ut te
sospitem, Incolumemque praestarent, si tu caeteros praestitisses: si contra,
illi quoque a custodia tui corporis oculos dimoverent, teque relinquerent
votis, quae non palam susciperentur. Alii se superstites Reip: optabant,
faciebantque: tibi salus tua invisa est, si non sit cum Reip: salute conjuncta.
Nihil pro te pateris optari nisi expediat optantibus; omnibusque annis in
consilium de te Deos mittis, exigisque ut sententiam suam mutent, si talis esse
desieris, qualis electus es. Sed ingenti conscientia Caesar, pacisceris cum
Diis, ut te si mereberis servent, cum scias an merearis, neminem magis, quam
Deos scire, etc. Capis ergo Caesar salutis tuae gloriosissimum fructum ex
consensu Deorum: nam cum ex^ipias, ut ita demum te Dii servent si been Remp: et
ex utilitate omnium rexeris, certus es te been remp: gerere dum servent, etc.
Scis tibi ubique Iurari, cum ipse ^uraveris omnibus. Nemo hoc sibi non
praestat: amamus quidem te, in quantum mereris; ist^d tamen non tui facimus
amore, sed nostri: nec unquam illucescat D^es, quo pro te nuncupet vota, non
utilitas nostra, sed fides, Caesar. page 14^.
Super h^c precati sumus, ut sic te amarent Dii, quemadmodum tu nos: quis hoc
aut de se, aut Principi diceret mediocriter amanti? Pro nobis ipsis quidem haec
fuit summa votorum, ut nos sic amarent Dii, quomodo t^si. Estne verum quod
inter ista clamavimus, O NOS FELICES! Quid enim felicius nobis, quibus non jam
illud optandum est, ut nos diligat Princeps, sed Dii quemadmodum Princeps?
Civitas religionibus dedita, semperque Deorum indulgentiam page 167, 168.
pie merita, nihil felicitati suae putat astrui posse, ni^i ut Dii Caesarem
imitentur. After which passages, he clozeth his Panegyric, with this prayer:
In fine Orationi Praefides, custodesque I^perii Deos, ego Consul pro re bus
humanis, ac te praecipue Capitoline Jupiter precor, ut beneficiis tuis faveas,
tantisque muneribus add^s perpetuitatem. Audisti quae malo Principi
praecabamur, Exa^di quae pro dissimilissimo optamus. Non te distringimus Votis,
non enim pacem, non concordiam, non securitatem, non opes oramus, non bonores:
simplex, cunctaque i^a complexum unum omnium votum est, salus Principis. Nec
enim nova tibi injungimus, tu enim jam tunc illum in tutelam recipisti, cum
praedonis avidissimi faucibus eripuisti: neque enim sineauxilio tuo, cum
altissima quaeque quaterentur, hic, qui omnibus excelsior, inconcussus stetit:
praeterritus est a pessimo Principe, qui praet^riri ab optimo non potuit. Tu
elara judicii tui signa misisti cum proficiscenti ad exercitum tuo nomine, tuo
honor cessisti. Tu voce Imperatoris quid sentir (...) locutus, filium illi,
nobis Parentem, tibi Pontificem maximum elegisti. Qu^ majore fiducia, Iisdem
illis votis quae ipse pro se nunxupari jubet, oro et obtestor, si been Remp. si
ex utilitate omnium Regis, primum ut illum nepotibus nostris ac pronepotibus
serves; deinde ut quandoque et tribuas quem genuerit, quem formaverit,
slmilemque fecerit adoptato; aut si hoc Fato negatur, in consilio sis eligenti,
monstresque aliquem adoptari in Capitolio deceat.

Rerum Romanorum, l. 10. p. 116. Imperial Hist. J. Lipsii Commentarius in
Panegy^. Trajano dict.
Eutropius, Pedro Mexia, Grimston in the life of Trajan, and others record,
that after Trajans death, it was a usual Custom in Rome, conti^ing til
Eutropius his time, and after, that when they powered out their Blessings upon
their new elected Emperors, they would pray, that they might be as fortunate as
Augustus, and as good as Trajan, accounting the one to have attained the
height o^ Happiness, and the other of all Goodness.

Antonius Pins, p. 10.
Julius Capitolinus records, that whiles Antonius Pius governed Italy, and
ascended the Tribunal, the people used this amongst other Acclamations,
Auguste, Dii te servent, Augustus, the Gods preserve thee. ( In the life of
Avidius Cassius, p. 126.
) Uulcanus Gallicanus relates, that when the Letter of Marcus Antoninus, Pius,
the Emperor to the Senate of Rome, was read in the Senate House; the Senate
prosecuted his clemency therein expressed, with these Acclamations and Prayers,
Antonine Pie, Dii te servent. Antonine clemens, Dii te servent, Antonine
Clemens, Dii te servent. Vincis inimicos, hosts ^xuper as, Dii te tuentur.

When ( Herodi (...). Pedro Mexia, Grimston, and others in his life.
) Commodus, after his Election to be Emperor was coming toward Rome, he was
received with incredible joy and solemnity in all Cities through which he
passed, for the great love to his Father M. Aurelius Antoninus, and the hopes
they conceived of him, that he would prove a good Prince. In Rome it self he
was received with exceeding great joy, triumph, and Blessings generally of all
men, who strowed the way he went with flowers, making all the Demonstratioas of
Joy that was possible, though he proved most cruel and vicious afterward.

( Anto^inu; Diadumenus, p. 280, 281.
) Aelius Lampridius stories, tha^ Macrinus the Emperor, understanding how
acceptable the name of Antoninus was to the Soldiers and people, presented his
Son Diadumenus to the Captains and Soldiers by the name of Antoninus.
Whereupon they made these Acclamations, Macrine Imperator, Dii te servent.
Antonine Diadumene, Dii te servent. Antoninum divum omnes rogamus. Jupiter
optime maxim Macrino et Antonino vitam. Tu scis Jupiter Macrinus vinci non
potest. All prayers for them.

( Alexander Severus, p. 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338.
) Aelius Lamprid. informs us, when Alexander Severus was elected and enstalled
Emperor by the whole Senate of Rome in the House and Temple of Concord, after
his com^g thither, acclamatum est, Auguste innocens, Dii te servent. Alexander
Imperator, Dii te servent, Dii te nobis dederunt, Dii conservent, Dii te ex
manibus impuri eripuerunt. Impurum tyrannum (Heliogabalum) et tu perpessus es:
Impurum et Obscoenum et tu vivere doluisti. Dii illum irradicaverunt, Dii te
servent. Infamis Imperator rite damnatus. Felices nos Imperio tuo; felicem
Rempublicam. Infamis unco, tractus est ad exemplum timoris: luxuriosus
Imperator jure punitus est. Contaminator honorum jure punitus est. DII
IMMORTALES ALEXANDRO VIT AM. Judicia Deorum hinc apparent. Et cum egisset
gratias Alexander, acclamatum est, Antonine Alexander, DII TE SER VENT.
Antonine Aureli DII TE SERVENT. Antonine Pie, DII TE SERVENT. Antonini nomen
suscipias rogamus, etc. In te salus, in te vita, ut vivere delectet.
Antoninorum Alexandro vitam ut vivere delectet, et Antoninus vocetur.
Antoninorum templa Antoninus dedicet. Parthos et Persas Antoninus vin^at,
Sacrum nomen sacratus accipiat. Antonini nemen, Antonin^rum nomen DII
CONSERVENT. In te omnia, per te omnia, Antonine ^bemus. Et post acclamationes,
Aurelius Caesar A^gustus, made this speech to them, Grati a^ vobis, Patres
Conscripti, non nunc primum, sed et de Caesareo nomine, and de vita servata and
Augusti nomine addito, and de Pontificatu maximo, and de Tribunitia potestate
and Proconsulari Imperio, quae omnia novo exemplo uno die in me contulistis. Et
cum dicere^ acclamatum. Haec suscepisti, Antoninum nomen tu sus^ipe: Mereatur
Senatus, mereantur Antonini, An^onine Auguste Dii te servent, Dii te Antoninum
conservent. Monetae nomen Antonini reddatur. Templa Antoninorum, Antoninus
conservet. Which name of Antoninus he by two modest Speeches refusing to
accept: Twice acclamatum est ut supra. Upon his 3d. Speech to put it off,
acclamatum est, Dii mala prohibeant: haec te imperante non timemus: de his te
duce securi sumus, etc. Upon his 4th. Speech, acclamatum est ut supra. Upon his
6th. Speech to excuse the accepting of this name, ac^amatum est, Alexander
Auguste, Dii te servent. Vere^undiae t^ae, prudentiae tuae, castitati tuae,
hinc intelligimus qualis futurus sis, hinc probamus, etc. Alexander Auguste,
Dii te servent. Templa Antoninorum Alexander Augustus dedicet. Caesar noster,
Augustus noster, Imperator noster, Dii te servent, vincas, valeas, multis annis
Imperes. After his 8th. Speech to them, acclamatum est, magne Alexandre, Dii te
servent. And when by a 9th. Speech he refused this Title of Magni Alexandri,
acclamatum est, Aureli Alexander Auguste, Dii te servent. As you may read more
at large in Lampridius. Which done, the Senate being dismissed, he returned to
his House in triumph. Grimstons Imperial History, p. 161. and pedro, Mexia.
Unspeakable was the Joy, and infinite were the Prayers and Blessings, that by
the Senate and People were powered out upon him that day.

This Emperor ( Aelius Lamprid^us, Alex, Sev. p. 388.
) Severus having conquered the Persians, and made a brave triumph, and speech
to the Senate in Rome, concerning this Conquest, on the 8. of October. he
concluded his Oration with these words. Vestrum est supplicationem decernere,
ne Diis videamur ingrati: Whereupon it follows, Acclamatio Senatus: Alexander
Auguste, Dii te servent. Persice maxim, Dii te servent. Vere Parthicus, vere
Persicus. Trophaea tua and nos videmus, victorias and nos videmus. Juveni
Imperatori, Patri Patriae, Pontifici maximo: per te victoriam per Germaniam
speramus; per te victoriam undique praesumimus: ille vincit, qui milites regit:
dives Senatus, dives miles, dives populus Romanus, etc.

Lib. 3. See La Cerda Annot: in Tertull. Apolog.
Corippus thus relates and Poetically describes the acclamations and the
prayers of Pagan Romans, at the inaugurations of their Emperors.

Augusti vitam laetis clamoribus optant;
Post senium dicunt sese juvenescere: mundus
Gaudet, and antiquae repetit primordia formae.
The Pagan Idolatrous Romans accused and prosecuted the Primitive Christians as
Traitors and Enemies to these Pagan Emperors, not only because they did not
swear by their Genius, nor adore, nor honor them as Gods, as they did out of
flattery; but likewise because they refused to offer Sacrifices, and prayers
for them to their Idol-Gods, as they used to do: as Justin Martyr, Athenagoras,
Tertullian, in their Apologies for the Christians, Origin in his 8. book
against Celsus, St. Cyprian and Arnobius record in their forecited passages,
wherein they answered and refuted this calumny as false. ( (...) (...) (...)
(...)
) Tertullian, in answering it, informs us, that when the Roman Emperors besto^
any Gift of money or corn, amongst the common peop^ in congiario dividundo,
etiam illa h^ra qua acolamant, De annis nostris augeat tibi Jupiter annos,
notwithstanding these expressions of Loyalty to and Prayers for the Emperor,
they did yet secretly in their hearts wish for a new Emperor. Jam si
pectoribus, ad translucendum quandam specularem materiam natura obduxisset,
cujus non praecordia insculpta apparerent novi ac novi Caesaris scena in
congiario dividundo praesentis? And not only the vulgar, but plane caeteri
ordines pro autoritate RELIGIOSI, ex fide nihil hosticum de ipso Senatu, de
equite, de castris, de palatiis ipsis spirant. This he proves by the Sea Ae^ii,
Spartiani, Severus, piscenias Niger, and Claudius Al binus, Vulcatii Gallicani
Avi dius Cassius, and La Cerda in Tertul. Apo log.
Cassii, Nigri et Albini, (and other Conspirators against the Emperor Severus,
who notwithstanding this, conspired against and murdered the Emperor,) omnes
illi sub i^sa usque impietatis eruptione, et sacra faciebant pro salute
Imperatoris, et genium ejus dejerabant, aliiforis, alii intus. So that they
usually prayed and sacrificed for their Pagan Emperors, though they were
treacherous and perfidious to them, which no Christians under them ever were.

To pretermit all other Presidents of this kind in Histories, and in
Panegyrical Orations, Poems, Epistles, and Inscriptions by the Pagan Romans to
their Heathen Emperors, expressing their Prayers, Supplications, Intercessious,
Thanksgivings, Acclamations, Vows, Applauses in behalf of their Emperors both
at their elections, inaugurations, confirmations, triumphs, congiaries, and all
other occasions; I shall conclude with these already cited, being full,
punctual, and rarely taken notice of; these Pagans by the light of Nature,
punctually pursuing the Apostles exhortation, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. to the shame
of those Christians who neglect it.

A Corollary to the 5. precedent Chapters.
I Should now proceed to the 3. remaining Chapters, wherein I shall evidence by
manifold notable punctual Testimonies, Presidents, and Records, not Vulgarly
known. 1. The constant practice of the Christians, and Churches of this our
Island of Great Britain, from Lucius the first Christian King thereof, till
Jan. 30. 1648. the day of King Charles his bloody death, in making
supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings unto God, for their
Kings, Queens, and their royal posterity, both in public and private
devotions, and in their Epistles and addresses to them, whether good or bad,
pious or impious, orthodox or heterodox, gracious or tyrannical. 2. The
universal practice of all the primitive Christians, Churches, Fathers, Councils
under the Roman Emperors, and Kings after they turned Christians, and of their
successors in all succeding ages to this present, in doing the like. 3. The
usual special forms of prayers, collects, supplications and thanksgivings, at
the solemn Inaugurations and Coronations of their Emperors, Kings and Princes.
But these being somewhat long, and requiring more time to digest and publish
them, than I am yet master of, I shall reserve them (God willing) for a Second
part, if this find acceptance, as no doubt it will with all pious real
Subjects, truly 1 Pet. 2. 17.
fearing God, and honoring their lawful King. I shall therefore cloze up this
part, with a few brief Corollaries and Conclusions, deduced from, and warranted
by the premised Chapters.

1. That it is not a mere arbitrary and voluntary, but the very bounden
commanded, indispensible duty of every Christian and Subject whatsoever, but
more especially of Ministers and Clergymen, by the Law of God, Nature,
Nations, to make daily, hearty, fervent, constant supplications, prayers,
intercessions and thanksgivings, unto God for their lawful Emperors, Kings,
Princes, and their royal Posterity where hereditary; whether their Emperors or
Kings be Infidels, Idolaters, Papists, Heretics, Persecutors, Tyrants, or
Orthodox Christians, Protestants, Just, Righteous, Pious, Merciful, and
Fathers to their people. And that it is not only a great sin and impiety
against God, but a high contempt, Indignity, Disloyalty and Treason to their
Sovereigns, to neglect and give over these duties, or coldly or rarely to
perform them.

2. That these duties are more frequently, fervently and constantly to be
practiced by Ministers and all other Subjects and Christians, in the times of
their Emperors, Kings and Princes greatest Dangers, Troubles, Trials,
Distresses, Exiles, Necessities, Sickn^ss^s, Sufferings, Afflictions,
Temptations, because then they need them most; as well as private Christians,
Churches, Nations, as the ( Ps. 132. ^ Ps. 119. 153. Ps. 9. 13. Ps. 20. 1. Ps.
22. 11. Ps. 39 10. Ps. 46. 1. Ps. 60. 11. Ps. 63. 17. Ps. 81. 7. Ps. 102. 2.
Ps. 106. 6, 13, 19. 28 Ps. 143. 11. Isa. 26. 16. Jer. 3. 27. c. 12. 14. c. 14.
8. John 27. 9. c. 30. 15. 2 Chronicles 20. 9. c. 33. 12. Jer. 30. 15. Lam 1. 9. c 3.
19. Jam. 5. 13, 14. Acts 12. 5. 2; Cor. 1. 12. Phil. 1. 19. 1 These. 3. 10. Heb.
5. 7, Isa. 37. 15, etc. c. 38. 2.
) marginal Scriptures will abundantly evidence

3. That it is not only unnatural, unchristian, and inhuman, but antichristian,
tyrannical, treasonable, if not diabolical and atheistical, for any usurped
Powers or Innovators whatsoever, not only to enforce Subjects against their
Loyalty, Consciences, the Presidents of all Christ^ans, Pagans, and the
P^ecepts of God himself, not onl^ by unrighteous, flagitious Edicts and
Engagements t^ command and enjoin both Ministers, and all other Subjects to See
my Concordia Dis^s.
abjure their former hereditary Kings, their Heirs and lawful Successors,
against all Scripture presidents, Laws, their former Oaths of Fealty, Homage,
Allegiance, Supremacy, Protestation, Vow, Leagues and Solemn Covenant, to be
true, loyal, faithful and obedient Subjects to them, their Heirs and
Successors, and to maintain and defend their Persons, Rights, Jurisdictions and
Crowns, with their lives and estates, against all attempts, conspiracies, and
machinations whatsoever; but to inhibit under severe penalties, all public and
private Prayers, Intercessions, and Thanksgivings unto God in their behalfs,
even in their greatest extremities, when they stand most in need of them. And
to commit, imprison, sequester, and cast any Subjects into a Lions den, for
obeying God herein, rather than men, (as the Act. 4. 18, 19, 20, 21. c. 5. 16,
27, 28, 29, 40, 41.
Highpriests heretofore committed and imprisone^ the Apostles, and the Dan. 6.
4, to 25.
Babylonian Princes, and King, the Prophet Daniel) the extremity of Tyranny,
Impiety, and ^m. 3. 14, 15, 16. Rev. 2. 10.
devilish persecution, which God will most severely revenge, and recompense in
due season

4. That for any professing themselves the chiefest of all Saints, and men
truly fearing God, to obliterate, deface, and remove out of all our Churches,
Chapels, Courts, public Halls and places, the Arms of their lawful Kings, to
erect only a bloody Cross, and Irish Harp in their steads, and to deleate in
some places these sacred Texts of Prove. 24. 21. My Son fear thou the Lord and
the King, etc. 1 Pet. 2. 17. Fear God, honor the King; and in other places,
HONOR the King, (permitting Fear God, to stand alone) on the Church walls, and
other places where they were painted or carved near the Kings Arms, and to make
such a strange divorce between these 2. sentences which God himself has united
and so strictly conjoined both in the Old Testament and New: That so the
Ministers and people might be thereby deterred, not only from honoring and
praying for their Kings, as God enjoins them, but induced to cast off the very
fear and public worship of God himself; and provoked at last, to say with the
despairing Idolatrous revolting 10. tribes of Israel, Hos. 10. 3. We have no
King because we feared not the Lord, what then should and King do to us? (a
crime whereof so me swaying Grandees have been deeply guilty in our 3.
Kingdoms) is in truth the highest strain of Apostasy, Irreligion, pr^fessed
Atheism and contempt of God, that ever men professing themselves Saints or
Christians were guilty of, in any age since the Creation. And for others of
them to say in the very Church, and presence of God himself, with much passion
(as ^ho. Lister.
one of the sitting Juncto did very lately) that the word KING does so stick in
our Ministers mouths and teeth, that it will never be well, till it be thrust
and forced down their throats (by force and armed Tyranny;) only because Mr.
Case, in his prayer after Sermon, at St. Martins Church, on the Lords day,
prayed; That God ( Isa. 49. 23.
according to his promise, and in his own sense and meaning, would be
graciously pleased, to make Kings to become NursingFathers, and Queens to be
Nursing-Mothers to his Church; is such a transcendent strain of Atheistical
impiety, Antimonarchical malice, brutish Tyranny and Barbarity, as should make
our very hearts and loins to q uake, and will certainly draw down the extremity
of Gods vengeance on those who are guilty thereof, if not on our whole now
miserably distracted, oppressed and almost ruined Kingdoms, if not timely
repented of.

5ly. That Kings and Monarchy, are the very best, most desirable, happyest,
peaceablest, honorablest, safest Governors and Governments of all others in the
world because in the first place, we are commanded, obliged by God himself, to
make supplications, intercessions, prayers and thanksgivings unto him for them,
that under them (...) live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godliness and
honesty (but never for a Commonwealth by name) and all Christian, Nations in
all ages, have accordingly practiced it, as the premises and second part, will
abundantly demonstrate.

6ly. That ever since we neglected, disused and gave over this public
Christian duty for our just hereditary Kings, their heirs, successors, and
royal posterity, and have abandoned, abjured, engaged against them and
Kingship, we have never had, nor enjoyed a quiet and peaceable life, in Church
or State, and have generally abandoned all real godliness and honesty, which
are hardly to be found in any of our 3. Kingdoms, especially amongst our
Grandees, Army Officers, and those refined, sublimated Saints of the last
edition, who most pretend unto them; and have done, acted, voted, settled
nothing, that is good or acceptable in the sight of God the Father, or tending
toward the Temporal or eternal salvation of all men, and reducing them to the
knowledge, much less the practice of the truth; but we have been still
disquieted, vexed, oppressed, tormented with endless wars, tumults, revolutions
of Governors and Governments, intolerable taxes, excises, losses, decay (...)
trade by Land and Sea, errors, schisms, sects, heresie^ blasphemies of all
sorts, and an inundation of all vices sins, hypocrisies, perjuries, treacheries
and wickednesses which may hasten our total and final dissolution, without any
hopes of mercy, restoration or future settlement, or hearts or wisdom to lay
hold of those manifold opp^rtunities which Gods wonder-working providence has
put into our hands, to preserve and restore us, if timely laid hold on and
improved by us for that end.

7. That the only ready, hopeful, christian, divine and most effectual means
now left, and prescribed by God to every private Minister, Christian Family,
Church, and our three ruined, lacerated, distracted Kingdoms, to recover and
restore their long expected, and vainly endeavored pristine peace, quietness
settlement, trade, godliness, honesty, honor, prosperity, the saving knowledge,
power, sincere profestion and truth of the Gospel, with all other blessings of
this and a better life; and to put a period to all future wars, revolutions,
tumults, oppressions, tyrannies, taxes, heresies, blasphemies, and Jesuitical
designs, now threatening ruin both to our Church, Kingdoms, Families and
Poste^ities, is for all and every of them, publicly and privately to revive
and practice these duties with constancy, frequency, zeal, fervency, resolution
for our undoubted hereditary King, and the royal posterity in their and our
greatest distresses, according to the premised Commands and Presidents,
recorded in Scripture by God himself, and the Presidents of all Gods Saints and
people in former Ages, maugre all oppositions, or inhibitions of poor
despicable Mortals; the long neglect and discontinuance of this sacred duty and
most effectual remedy, being (as I fear) the principal cause of the long
continuance and increase of their and our miseries, afflictions, pressures, and
sad confusions. If then the serious consideration of Gods own reiterated
Injunctions, the presidents of Fathers, Christians, Saints, Martyrs, Subjects
inall ages, yea of the very Pagans themselves, and the many Oaths, Vows,
Covenants, Protestations, Declarations, Remonstrances, we have formerly made,
with our own and our Ancestors constant practice of these Duties for many
hundreds of years, will not persuade us hereunto; yet let the consideration of
our personal and national preservation, establishment, peace, settlement,
prosperity both as men and Christians; and the cheapness, easiness of this
homage and duty to God, our King, Country, and our selves (which all Ezra 10,
1, etc Jonah. 2. 7, 8.
exes, ages though mean, poor in Purse, or feeble in Body, unable to assist and
aid their Sovereign or Country in either, are as able to perform, as well as
the noblest Peers, the richest Subjects the valiantest Soldiers, or the wisest
States men,) now at last excite and engage them unanimously, conscien^iously
and fervently to perfom them both in public and private. To induce them more
cheerfully thereunto, I shall recommend unto them this memorable obser^ation,
and seasonable passage of St. B^sil the Great, famous in his gene^ation, and in
the Church of Christ.

(...), (...) (...) (...) (...).
Being by the goodness and benignity of my most good God, through the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ, according to the operation of the holy Ghost, delivered
from the error of the Gentiles traditions, and long ago, even from the
beginning educated by Christian parents, I verily learned the holy Scriptures
from them, ^om my childhood, which brought me into the knowledge of the truth:
but when I became a man, and had very frequently used peregrinations, and had
fallen into the consideration of many things, as was meet; I verily found in
other Arts and Sciences much concord amongst those, who exactly exercise
singular Arts: but in the Church of God, only and for which Christ dyed, and
into which he has abundantly and richly powered forth his holy Spirit, I
observed the greatest discord, and vehement dissentions of many, both between
themselves, and also against the divine Scripture: and that which is most
horrid, the very Presidents of the Church constituted in so great a Dissension
both of mind, and opinions between themselves, and fighting against the
commands of our Lord Jesus Christ, with so great contrariety, as even cruelly
to dissipate the Church of Christ, and to disturb his redeemed Flock, without
any commiseration; that even on these now, if ever when wicked men went out and
flourished, that of the Apostles may be fulfilled Acts 20. 29, 30.
Out of your selves shall aris^ men, speaking perverse things, that they may
draw disciple^ a^r them. When I discerned these things and the like, and
doubted what, and whence the sourse of so great an e^l might be, at first I was
as it were in some thick dark^sse, and as if ^t in a balance, I did turn my
self now on this side, now on that side; onescale drawing me to it sel^, by
reason of thelong custom of men, but the other pulling me back for the truth
acknowledged in the holy Scripture. Now when as this ^ad for some space, and
very (...) happened, whiles I was searching out the cause of this ^vil, as I have
related, (...) (...) the Book relating the History of the Judges, came into my
mind, where it is written, Judges 17. 6. c. 18. 1. c. 21. 25.
that every one then did what seemed right in his eyes, and the cause thereof
is declared together with it, in that which is premised; That in those days,
there was no King in Israel Therefore remembering these things, I did think even
of these present dissentions, that which truly is ^errible to be spoken, and
perchance a paradox; but if it shall be considered and weighed, is most true,
that peradventure even now, for the contempt of one great, true and only King
of all, there is so great Dissension and Fighting among those who are in the
Church of Christ, whiles every one has revolted from the Doctrine of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and challenges to himself by his As our Army Councils, Junctoes
and Grand^s h^ve d^ne, and do.
own Authority, his own cogitations and definitions; and would rather reign
against the Lord, than be subject to the Lord, and be governed by him. When I
searched this with my self, and stood amazed at this monstrous impiety, and did
yet further search it out, I was farther persuaded, that the foresaid cause was
true, by nothing more then from the things of this life. For I saw every state
of a multitude, well compounded, and to obtain agreement and consist together,
so long only as their obedience was kept toward See (...) Rhodigi^ (...)
Lectio^. l. 24. c. 29, 30.
some one King over them all; and on the other side, that dissension and
division of every kind, yea and moreover polyarchy did arise from hence, if
there being no King, there was a liberty obtained of doing any thing we would.
I have seen sometimes even a swarm of See (...) here, P. 71, 7^.
Bees from the Law of Nature to wage War, and in order to follow their own
King; And tr^ly I my self have beheld many such things, and I have also heard
many such things, and those know more who are employed about these things; that
even from hence, that I have said may be proved to be true; for it is the
property and peculiar of those, who (...) unto the command of one, and obey and
use one King, that they are and may be well disposed and at concord among
themselves; therefore all d ssention and discord, is both a Judgment and sign of
that contumacy, wherein the principality of one is rejected. According to the
same reason, even the very dissension which is forbidden both between the
Commandments of our Father and our Lord, and also between our selves, (...),
either from a departure from the true King, or from the r^uncing of him: which
he there further proves from sundry Texts. Therefore by his and Gods own
resolution, there is no way to heal our manifold Dissensions, Distractions, and
restore peace, unity, order in our Church and State, but by returning to our
true lawful Spiritual and Temporal only Kings, both whom we have most
contemptuously and obstinately so long rejected, both in ^ur dev^tions and
legal transactions, our Church and State affairs; which I wish all Republicans
and Antimonarchists most seriously to ponder, and our new Junctoes, and General
Council of Army Officers, seduced and acted by De Monarchia Hisp. c. 21.

and their spiritual as well as temporal King, and Monarchy under their feet.

admirable stupendous providence, (of which they will not take notice) for
this their obstinate opposition of and rebellion against their Kings, Monarchy
and Kingship; Prove. 24. 21, 22. so no doubt, ( Psalm 2 4, 5, 6, 9.
) He that sits in the Heavens, if they therein still proceed, will laugh at
them, and their Antimonarchical Votes, the Lord shall have them in derision;
yea he shall speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore
displeasure, He shall break them with a rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces
like a Potters vessel. maugre all their forces, votes, counsels, confederacies,
and make good those general promises, ( Psalm. 2. 6.
) Yet have I set my King upon my holy Hill of Sion. ( Psalm. 100. 2

) Great deliverance gives he unto his King, and sh^th mercy to his Anointed,
to vid, and to his Seed for evermore. And that which is most considerable,
their own transcendent, unpresidented, tyrannical, illegal, unrighteous,
violent proceedings against the whole House of Peers, the majority of their own
secluded, ejected old Fellow Members, the City of London, and their Common
Council, (their former chief Supporters,) whom they have now made the scorn and
derision of the World, by voting down their Common Council, and pulling down
their Gates, Percullises and Posts, before any hearing, or Judgment, and
putting higher affronts upon them after all their former Obligations, and the
late Kings large Privileges granted to them in the Isle of Weight, than ever
any Kings of England formerly did, or durst attempt; Their dis-obliging and
dis-carding all or most of those Army Officers and Soldiers who first created
them a Parliament, without a King or House of Lords, and restored them to their
present power in May last; and engaging others of them in such displeasing
services, as do render them odious for the present, and infamous to posterity;
Their exasperating the generality of the Nobility, Gentry, Ministers, and
Commons of our three Kingdoms against them, by their peremptory denial to
admit, and forcible seclusion and voting out the old secluded Members, (the
Majority of the House) to monopolize all Parliamentary power and Offices into
their own hands, and refusing the convening of a free and full Parliament,
without prelimitations, to settle our Distractions, according to the general
Desires and Addresses of most Counties and Cities of the Kingdom, and
imprisoning some worthy Gentlemen and Swordmen, only for presenting at their
Counties requests, these their Desires in Letters, directed to their Speaker,
and unjustly refusing to bayl them upon Habcas Corporaes. in Courts where they
sit both as Members and Judges, and Parties, which none ever did before;
thereby leaving the subjects in greater Vassalage, than ever they sustained
under the late King, whom they In their Decla^ation of March 17. 1648.
branded and beheaded as the worst of all Tyrants. And yet doubling and
trebling their Taxes, in their exhausted condition, and loss of all Trade for
those very 6. Months space, for which they were taxed and forced to pay in
before hand by them, without their Common consent in Parl d^ring their
Representatives forcible seclusion, against their own Act Oct. 11. 1659.
contrary to all their former and late Declarations, no Kings of Engl^nd having
been so extra vagant, arbitrary, unjust and oppressive in their Governments and
proceedings, as they have been, and that in the very midst of their own private
sears and unsettlement, and our public dangers, after all the late vast
expenses of blood, and treasure, to maintain our Laws, Liberties, Propertys
against all arbitrary and tyrannical powers; nor yet daring to attempt against
their Subjects, what they have boldly acted against their fellow Members, and
the People, whom they once Jan. 4. 164.
voted the Sovereign power of the Nation, and whose servants (not Lords) they
pretend themselves; which desperate violences, oppressions, and extravagances,
without any hopes of ease, peace, liberty or settlement, will render our Kings
and Kingshi^ more amiable and desirable than ever, and more promote, and
accelerate their restitution, than all Royallists Counsels and endeavors
whatsoever, in wise men's Judgments. Cum duplicantur lateres, Venit Moses.

THE SECOND PART OF THE Signal Loyalty and Devotion of Gods true Saints and
Pious Christians under the Gospel, (especially in this our Island) toward
their Christian Kings and Emperors, Whether Orthodox or Heterodox, Virtuous or
Vicious, Protestants or Papists, Protectors or Persecutors, ever since their
KINGS and EMPERORS first became CHRISTIAN, till this present. Expressed in, and
Evidenced by their public and private Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions,
Thanksgivings, OPTIONS, Acclamations, for their long life, Health, Safety,
Prosperity, Victory over Enemies, temporal, spiritual and eternal Felicity;
peaceable, just, glorious reign over them, etc. And likewise for their Queens,
Children, Royal Posterity, Realms, Armies, Counsels, Officers. Largely
manifested both in point of Theory and Practice in a Chronological method, by
Fathers, Councils, Ecclesiastical Histories, Liturgies, Missals, Books of
public and private Prayers, Poems, Panegyricks, Epistles, Records, Charters,
and Authors of all sorts and ages. Together with the various Forms of Prayers,
Supplications, Collects, Votes, and Acclamations used at the Coronations of
Emperors and Kings, especially of our ancient and late Kings of England and
Scotland (not hitherto published.)

THE SECOND PART OF THE Signal Loyalty and Devotion of Gods true Saints and
pious Christians toward their KINGS.
HAving lately presented the world, with the first part of the Signal Loyalty
and Devotion of Gods true Saints and Pious Christians (as likewise of
Idolatrous Pagans) toward their Kings and Emperors, both before and under the
Law, and also under the Gospel, whiles their Emperors and Kings were Idolaters
and Ethnicks, expressed both by their private and public Supplications,
Prayers, Intercessions and Thanksgivings unto God, and by their Votes,
Acclamations unto themselves and others, for their health, safety, long-life,
temporal, spiritual, and eternal felicity, whether they were Good or Bad,
Orthodox or Heterodox, Protectors or Persecutors, in 5. distinct Chapters, I
shall now (by Gods assistance) proceed to the constant practice of Christians
under the Gospel, in this kind, after their Kings and Emperors became
Christians, professing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, whether their Kings and
Emperors were gracious, and Religious, vicious or impious, Orthodox or
Erroneous; beginning with the Kings of our own Island, and presenting you with
presidents of this kind, both in foreign Prelates, and Clergymen, as well as in
their Domestic Christian Subjects of all sorts, our British Island producing
the first Christian King, Queen, and Emperor in the world, and the first
presidents of private and public Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions and
thanksgivings for them, unto God, and Votes, Acclamations for their safety,
health, life and prosperity, as they were Christian.

CHAP. VI.
THe very first Christian King, professing the Christian Religion under the
Gospel, mentioned in History, is Lucius, King of the Britons, reigning in this
our Island; this King ( (...) De Britan. Ecclesiarum Primordils, p. 49. and the
Authors there quoted.
) Anno Christi 156. (as Radulphus Baldoc, the Anno 156.
Chronicle of Gisburn, the ancient Manuscript D. primo statu Landavensis
Ecclesiae, and Bishop Usher out of them relate) sending two Ambassadors to Pope
Elutherius, most earnestly and devoutly entreating him, That by his command and
will he might be made a Christian; This Pope thereupon granting his request,
Gratias agens Deo suo, etc. giving thanks to his God, and singing, Glory be to
God on high, for joy that this King and Nation, who had continued Gentiles from
the first peopling of the Island by Brute, did so ardently hasten to the faith
of Christ, sending Eluan, and Meduin to convert them. After which this (

) King Lucius in the year 179. or sooner, as some, or in the year 185. or
later, as others think it; writing a Letter to Pope Elutherius, to send him a
Copy of the Imperial Laws to govern his Nation by them; this Pope in the
conclusion of his Epistle (in Answer to the Kings Letter) inserted this devout
Prayer unto God in his behalf. Det vobis omnipotens Deus, etc. Almighty God
grant you so to rule the Kingdom of Britain, that you may reign for ever with
him, whose ^car you are in the Realm aforesaid. If this Pope, (though a foreign
Prelate) thus prayed to God for this first Christian King, no doubt his own
Christian Bishops and Ministers, (whom he endowed with ample possessions and
maintenance) and his Christian Subjects, in their private and public Prayers,
and Devotions to God, and in their Epistles and Addresses to him, did much more
imitate his example, in pursuit of the Apostles precept, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. as
all the Primitive Christians did even for their Pagan Kings and Emperors, (as I
have evidenced in the precedent Chapters) though we find no express mention
thereof in our British Histories.

The first Christian Queen in the world was Helena, Daughter of King Coel;
whose Son Constantine the Great, born and first created Emperor in our Island
of Britain, was the first Roman Emperor, who publicly professed the Christian
faith, and instituted public Prayers to be made unto God by his Soldiers,
People and Subjects, whether Christians or Ethnicks, for himself, his Sons, and
his Posterity; who constantly powered forth their Supplications, Prayers,
Intercessions and Thanksgivings unto God for his life, health, safety,
victories, and successes, as well in this our Island, as in all other places of
his Empire; as these passages of Eusebius, who lived in his Court, and
flourished under him, will abundantly evidence.

This Godly Christian Emperor ( Eusebius de vita Constantini, l. 2. c. 12, 13,
14, 19.
) Constantine, before his Battle with the persecuting Tyrant Licinius,
dedicated a certain vacant time to power forth Prayers to our Savior Christ in
the taberna^le of the Cross, which he fixed far remote from his Camp: where
afflicting his body with fasting and abstinence, he powered out Prayers and
Supplications to God to reconcile him to himself, and become his gracious
Protector: In which Duty he employed certain Persons, whom he reputed eminent
both for faith and piety, to join with and assist him in the performance
thereof, as he usually did upon other occasions before every battle with the
enemy. After which having vanquished Licinius, and by his death obtained the
sole power, and government over the Roman Empire; Omnes ubique victorem hymnis
celebrabant, Tum choreis and hymnis primum Deum, summum omnium regem esse
praedicarunt: deinde victorem Constantinum, ejusque f^os modestissimos, Deoque
charos Caesares, acclamationibus continuis extulerunt. After which this Godly
Emperor to excite his Subjects to Prayers, was Eusebius. de vita Constantini, l.
4. c 14, 15.
portrayed in all his Coyns and Statues standing upright with his eyes looking
up, and his hands stretched forth and elevated toward Heaven, as if he were
praying, and prescribed all his Legions, and Soldiers, as well Pagans as
Christians, this set form of Prayer in the Roman tongue, which they were to use
and recite every Lords day, and in their daily prayers, with their hands and
eyes lifted up to Heaven unto God the Giver o^ all good things, and Author of
victory. Eusebius. de vita Consta^. l. 4. c. 19, 20.
Te solum Deum agnoscimus, etc. We acknowledge thee to be God alone; we
profess thee to be King; we invocate thee our helper: by thee we have obtained
victories; by thee we have overcome Enemies: from thee we conf^sse we have
received present, and hope that we shall obtain future felicity. Tui omnes
supplices sumus, abs te petimus, ut Constantinum Imperatorem nostrum, una cum
piis ejus liberis quam diutissime nobis salvum and victorem conserves: We are
a^l Supplicants unto thee. We all request from thee, that thou would
conserve our Emperor Constantine together with his pious Children, safe and
victorious to us, for many generations, or, as long as possible may be, or for
ever. Ejusmodi fere Sanciebat a Militibus solis die fieri, talesque ab eis
voces in diurnis Precibus adhiber^. Which prayers no doubt were used in this
our Island of Britain, (where he was born and crowned) by his Soldiers, and
other Subjects, for him and his royal posterity, as well as in other places:
the Churches and Christians then in Britain, concurring both in their Doctrine
and Practice, with the Churches in Rome, Italy, Aphrick, Egypt, Spain, France,
Lybia, Greece, Asia, Pontus and Cilicia, as Nicephorus Eccles. Hist. l. 8. c.

Constantine himself records in his Epistle to all Churches concerning the
affairs of the Council of Nice, Anno 330. But of this more in the next Chapter.

It is the Observation of Thomas Rudburne, the History of Winton Church, and
Bishop Usher out of them, ( Ma^e Chronico, l. 1. c. 6. Wintoiensis Ecclesiae,

fulminosum, completo videlicet spatio viginti duorum annorum: unde Christiani
qui prius in sylvis opacissimisque locis se posuerant (within this our Island
of Britain, as well as in other places, during the reigns of Dioclesian,
Maximinian and Licinius, who grievously persecuted them) in publicum se
ostendentes (under Constantine the Great) renovant Ecclesias quae usque ad
solum undique erant destructae. Quo in tempore aedificata est Ecclesia
Wintoniensis secundo ab Christi fidelium oblationibus. The Christians daily
Prayers and tears to God in this our Island, being the principal means to cease
their former persecutions under their cruel Pagan Emperors, and to procure
them peace and prosperity under this first Christian Emperor Constantine, for
whose long life, and prosperous reign they daily Prayed unto God in the
Churches they re-edified and repaired during his pious Reign. Anno 435.

Guithelin, Archbishop of London, in the the year of our Lord 455. being ^ent
by the Christian Britons of our Island, into Britain in France, to crave aid
against the barbarous Nations, who invaded, murdered, spoiled, and miserably
oppressed them; thereupon Androenus King of the French Britons sent his Brother
Constantine with 2000. men unto them, upon condition they should elect and
crown him for their King. Which expedition Constantine undertaking, Guithelin
thereupon brake out into these gratulatory Acclamations and Prayers unto Christ
for him. Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus imperat. Assit igitur
gratia Christi Regi Britanniae qui est defensio nostra, ut insulam miserimam ad
pristinam reducat libertatem. Christ overcommeth, Christ reigns, Christ
commands. Therefore let the grace of Christ be present and assistant to the
King of Britain who is our defense, that he may reduce the miserable Island to
its pristine liberty. A Prayer as suitable for our miserable exiled King and
Island now, as for this their new British King, and Island in that Age, wherein
the other Bishops, and Christian Britons made the like Prayers for him both at
and after his Coronation, as Guithelin did before it. Anno 488.

fo^getting to pray likewise for this good King, who repaired them, and restored
Christianity. Anno 490.

behalf. Omnipotentem Deum Benediximus, qui conversionem Gentis Anglorum mercedi

Epistle to Edilbert King Anno 60^.
of Kent, exhorted him, willingly to hear, devoutly to perform, and studiously
to keep in memory what Augustine, then his Bishop should admonish him, for this
reason, Quia si vos eum in eo quod pro omnipotenti Deo loquitur auditis, idem
Omnipotens Deus hunc pro vobis exorantem celerius exaudiet. Si- enim (quod
absit) verba ejus postponitis, quomodo eum omnipotens Deus poterit audire pro
vobis, quem vos negligitis audire pro Deo? (A clear evidence, that Augustine and
other Bishops and Christians in that age devoutly and constantly prayed to God
for King Edilbert) Tota igitur mente cum eo vos in fervore fidei stringite,
atque adnisum illius virtute quam vobis divi^tas tribuit adjuvate, ut regni sui
vos ipse faciat participes, cujus vos fidem in regno vestro recipi facitis, et
cus^odiri. After which he concludes his Epistle with this prayer for this Kings
spiritual, temporal, and eternal safety, long life, felicity and salvation.

they were thus devout in kee^ping annual Vigils, and offering Prayers, Psalms,
and Sacrifices to God for the salvation of this King and his soul, after his
death: (according to the superstition of that and after ages) no doubt they
were as loyal and devout in praying and praising God for him during his life.

A c^ear evidence that the Churches and Ministers of Christ in England did then
constantly pray for their Christian Kings, who specially recommended themselves
to their prayers.

Our venerable and most learned Beda, does very much Anno 720.
p esse this Duty of Prayer for Kings, (though Pagans and Persecutors,) from
sundry Texts of Scripture, on which he comments. In his Operum Coloniae Agrip.
1612. Tom 5. Col. 379, 380.
Expositiones allegoricae in Ezram, l. 2. c. 7. Et offerant oblationes Deo
Coeli, Oren^que pro vita Regis et Filiorum ejus; He thus comments, Offerunt
autem ea Sacer dotes iidem pro vita Regis, et Filiorum ejus, j^xta illud
Ap^stoli, 1 Timothy 2. Obsecro igitur primo omnium fieri obsecrationes, orationes,
postulationes, and gratiarum actiones pro omnibus hominibus, pro Regi^ns and
omnibus qui in sublimitate sunt, ut quietam and tranquillam vitam agamus, etc.
And in his Fxposition on the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. Tom. 7. p. 708, 709, 710. he
recites and approves the passages of St. A^gustin at large (recited in the next
Chapter) commanding Prayers, Supplications, Intercessions and Thanksgivings to
be made, not only for Christian and pious Kings, but even for ^agans and
Idolaters, though vicious, though Persecutors of the Gospel and fincere
Professors thereof.

unanimes existerent in Deum, fide, spe and caritate, and seipsos invicem

The reason of making this Canon for incessant Prayers for Kings, Dukes and
Princes, is thus expressed in the preceding part thereof, that there was a
scandal and suspicion raised amongst the Priests of God and inferior Clergy,
that they had an ill opinion of Kings, Dukes and Princes (as too many have
now.) Hoc est, quod Reges cum Ducibus and Principibus suis, ac deind^ minoris
potetestatis, persuasi plurimi de eis dicere soleant, quod non tantum sincero
eos non diligant affectu, sed insuper eorum bonis prae^entibus, ac
prosperitatibus quibusque foelicioribus magis invideant, animo nimis infesto
quam devoto satis congaudeant cord, eorum que conversationis statum Odibili
quadam detractatione dilacerare non desinant. A very good ground to revive and
re-enforce this Duty both on Ministers and people now; Ut horis canonicis
Pr^ces fiant pro Regibus, as the Margin of this Canon prescribes, as well as
the body thereof.

Our famous Countryman Flaccus Alchuvinus, ( See Balaeus Scriptornm Brit.
(...). 2. c. 17.
Scholar Anno 790.
to our venerable Bed^, Tutor to the Emperor Charles the Great, and the
learnedest Englishman in that age) has many memorable rare passages and
prayers for Kings and Emperors in his Works and Epistles, not vulgarly known,
which I shall transcribe at large. In his Book De (...) usu. Operum Lutetiae
Paris. 1617. col. 152. d. he writes thus, Septem praeterea sunt Psalmi ex
quibus, si unum corpus efficimus, pro omni prorsus corpore oramus Ecclesiae; in
his namque memoria Sacerdotum, REGUMque et Potentatum; populi quoque et plebis
simul. Memento Domine David, etc. O^t of which Psalms he frames a Prayer, col.
153. Propitiare Domine, quaeso univer^ tuae Cacholicae Ecclesiae toto orb
terrarum diffu^ae, etc. Propitiare famulo suo, N Regi, cunctisque Christianis
Principibus, and universo exercitui eorum. In his 31. Epistle to Offa King of
Mercians, col. 1554. he concludes with this P^ayer, for Gods Grace and
Benediction upon him and his Realm. Divina te, tuumque Regnum coelesti
benedictione, comitetur gratia, Domine excellentissime. And Epistle 84.
(written by him to Offa in the name of Charles the Emperor) he thus closes it,
col. 1614. Uita, salus, and prosperitas tibi tuisque fide libuss a Deo Christo
detur in aeternum. In his 29. Epistle to Aedilred King of Northumberland,
(describing at large the Office of good Kings and Princes) col. 1540. he has
this passage. Ecclesiarum Christi sint defensores and tutores, ut Servorum Dei
orationibus, longa vivant prosperitate: And he closes his 79. Epistle to King
Aedilred, with this prayer for him, col. 1554. Deus omnipotens Regni
felicitate, morum dignitate, longaeva prosperitate te florere faciat,
dilectissime fili. His 48. Epistle to most noble King Egfrid King of M^rcians
concludes thus, col. 1562. E. Divina te in omni bonitate pietas florere faciat,
fili charissime. But of all his Prayers and Thanksgivings, those in his
Epistles to the Christian Emperor Charles the Great, his Scholar, written to
him for the most part, under the name of David Rex) are most observable. I
shall instance in some of the chiefest. In his Epistle to him, De Ratione
Septuagesimae, etc. col. 1142. he begins thus, Benedictus sit Deus Pater
omnipotens, qui te creavit and honoravit: and benedictus sit Dominus noster
Jesus Christus filius Dei ve^i, qui te redemit and elegit. Benedictus sit
Spiritus sanctus paracletus qui te illuminavit, and dilatavit cor tuum in omni
sapientia and scientia charitatis dilectissime D. D. and dulcissime Domine. Et
benedicta sit sancta Trinitas, unus Deus omnipotens, Pater and Filius and
Spiritus sanctus, qui mini serviculo suo, licet indigno, ta^em concessit
Dominum, amicum, and adjutorem gratiae ri^ae. Et benedicta sit potestas et
Regnum tuum, e^ Fi. ii (...), et Filii Filiorum tuorum, usque in generationes
(...) sempiternas: et veniat super te et super tuam Generationem benedictio
sanctorum in die Domini nostri Jesus Christi; utque sanctissima sua voluntas
vigeat ^loreat and crescat in cord tuo, clarissime Ecclesiae Christi rector
and defensor.

His 2d. Epistle to him Col. 1465. runs in the same words. His first Epistle to
him is thus directed, Col. 1462.

Domino piissimo, and praestantissimo and omni honor dignissimo David Regi,
Fiaccus Albinus, ve^ae beatitudinis aeternam in Christo salutem: After his
particular Thanksgiving to God for him, he thus proceeds, Non solum ego ultimus
servulus Salvatoris nostri, congaudere debeo prosperitati and exaltatione
clariss^ ae potestatis vesti ae, sed tota sancta Dei Eccles^ unanimo caritatis
concentu gratias agere Domino Deo omnipotenti (...); qui tam pium, prudentem
and justum his novissimis mundi and periculosissimis tem^oribus populo
Christiano perdonavit elementissimo munere Rectorem atque Defensorem; qui prava
corrigere, and recta corrobora^, and sancta sublimare omni intention studeat,
and nomen Domini Dei eccelsi per multa terrarum spacia dilatere gaudeat, and
Catholicae fide^ lumen in extremis mundi partibus incendere conetur, etc. In
qua Dominus noster Jesus Christus, qui est virtus and sapientia Dei, te
custodiat and exaltet, et ad gloriam perennis visionis suae pervenire faciat.

His Fpist. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, to 24. and (...)
Epistles to this Emperor, begin for the most part with wishing him perpetuae
pacis and gloriae salutem, perpetu am salutem, etc. His 4. Epistle to him, col.
1476. ends thus, Deprecantes quoque Domini D^i nostri clementiam, qui te
undique regat et custodiat, et victorem faciat omnium Inimicorum tuorum, seu
visibilsum seu invisib^um, quatenus cum co^ona gloriae, multis feliciter
regnaturum annis, ad regnum perpetuae beatitudinis pervenire, cum sidelibus
suis concedat. In his 6. Epistle, col. 1480 he and his Monks prayed thus for
him, Totum cordis mei aff^ctum, in gratiarum actiones Christo clementissimo
Regi effudi; illius Sedula oratione deprecans (...), cum omnibus nostrae
Devotionis cooperatorib^, quatenus vestram Pacificam and amabilem potentiam, ad
exaltationem sanctae suae Ecclesiae, and sacratissimi gub^rnacula Impe^ii,
longaeva prosperitate custodire, reg^re et dila^are vignetur. His 7. Epistle to
him begins thus, col. 1487. Gloria and laus ^eo Patri, and Dom. nostro Jesu
Christo, quia in gr^tia sancti Spiritus, per devotionem et ministerium sanctae
fidei, and bonae voluntatis vestrae, Christianitatis Regnum atque agnitionem
very Dei dilatavit, and plurimos long late^ue populos ab errori^us impiet^tis
in viam (...) deduxit, etc. His 9. Epistle ends with Prayers and Thanksgivings;
His 10. to ^im begins thus, col. 1499.

D^t tibi perpetuam Clemens in sede salutem,
Et D^us Imperii, David amate, Deus.
Tot^m me in gratiarum actiones Domino Deo (...) Christo (...) selicia
Christiano populo tempora in vestra felicitate, exaltatione and sal^te cer^sime
sciens; pro qua semp^r Dominum deprecari gaudeo, eandem semper audire d^sidero,
and quasi optatum, a Deoque destinatum munus, omni gaudio vestram incolumitatem
cupiens semper audire. ^is enim est qui non gaudeat sui capitis perfecta
integritate, nisi forte furibundus, vel insanus, quem arct^ssimis Hippocratis
vinculis allegandum esse censero? Et si juxta A ostoli sententiam Ephesians. 5.
N^mo carn^m suam odio habet; (...) etiam fovet and nutrit: Quanto magis n
capitis sanitate, in quo est totius corporis perf^tio et gloria, omnis ^mbrorum
compage gaudere debet? which Epistle he concludes thus,

Vest^a pr^cor, Christus (...) us inclyta donis
(...), (...) (...) (...) (...),
(...) (...) ^itae, duleis (...), glo^ia dulcis,
Sit tibi (...), David amate, salus,
Epistola 11. col. 1502. he writes, Continuis precibus Domini n^stri Jesu
Christi cl^mentiam d^precor, ^uantenus tibi optima quaeque in terrena
felicitate conc^ssit, long meliora (...) (...) is regna tibi (...) concedere
dignetur. Concluding it thus,

Mit is ab aethereo clementer Christus Olympo,
Te regat, exaltet, protegat, ornat, amet, etc.
He concludes his 12. Epistle to him thus, col. 1505.

Det tibi consilium pacis, simul atque salutis
David, amor populi, Christus ubique piu^
Omnipotens cujus defendat (...) a semper,
Victorem faciens, teque tuosque simul, etc.
In his 13. Epistle to him, col. 1507. he assures him, Nos precibus iter
vestrum continuis prosequ^mar, divinam humiliter obsecrantes clementiam,
quatenus vos, Vestrosque simul cum omni prosperitate sanos du^at and reducat
gaudentes: closing it with this distick,

T^mpora concedat Christus felicia Regni
Hujus and aeterni, David amate, tibi.
In his 14. Epistle to him, col. 1508. he writes, Felin populus qui tali
Principe gaudet, in cujus ^rosperitate salus (...), (...) consistit, etc.
concluding it with a Prayer, and these Verses,

Augeat, exaltet vestram benedictio vitam
Aeternae Regis, David amate Deo.
He ^loseth his 15. Epistle to him thus, col. 1511.

Floreat aeternis tecum sapientia donis,
Ut tibi permaneat laus, honor, imperium, etc.
The front of his 17. Epistle to him, col. 1513. begins with an option of
perpetuam aeternae gloriae salutem; and ends thus,

Alma Dei Christi tribuat tibi regna potestas
Aurea, cum sanctis, David, in arce poli.
In his 18. Epistle to him, he has this clause, col. 1514. Nec meas Preces pro
veftra stabilitate et salute cassatas in conspectu Dei credo, quia libenter
divina suscipit gratia Lacrymas quae ex charitatis font profluunt. He thus
concludes it.

Perpetuam Christi tribuat tibi gratia lucem,
Cum sanctis pariter, David amate Deo.
In his 19. Epistle, excusing his non-visiting the Emperor by reason of his
infirmity, he entreats him; pia compassione fessum concedat requiescere,
orationibusque pro vobis instare, clofing it with these verses.

David in aeternum tecum sit gratia Christi,
Ut vigeas, valeas, victor in orb potens;
Post haec, et teneas coelestia regna beatus
Cum sanctis pariter semper in arce poli, etc,
Inclytus aeternis David feliciter annis,
In Christi meritis vivat ubique sa^
In his 20. Epistle to him, col. 1517. he informs him. Sed and lacrymarum
munuscula mearum in orationibus apud S. Martinum, pro desiderantissima
authoritatis vestrae prosperitate vobis fideli transmitto sponsione. Ego orabo
pro Domino dilectissimo, quomodo sancti spiritus visitatio cor meum inluminare
dignabitur.

He winds up his 22. Epistle to him thus, col. 1521. Ad ^ujus vero summae
beatudinis, and indeficientis gloriae, post labores hujus vitae felicitatem,
Deus Jesus te pervenire faciat Domine desiderantissime, and omni honor
dignissime.

Diuitias tribuat veras tibi, David amate,
Cum sanctis pariter Christus in arce poli.
In the Inscription of his 23. Epistle to him, col. 1512. he prays for and
wishes to him praesentis and futurae beatitudinis salutem: and begins it with
this Thanksgiving. Benedictus Dominus Deus, et benedicta perpetua illius
misericordia super servos suos: pro quorum prosperitate et salute vos,
dulcissime David, prospere duxit, et pacifice reduxit, conservavit, honoravit
et exaltavit, atque in omni loco adventus vestri lumen justitiae pietatisque
ante faciem vestrae beatitudinis splendescere fecit, etc. Which he thus
concludes, Hocque Deum (...) prectbus obsecro, ut praesens vita Excellentiae
vestrae ejusdem sancti intercessionibus adjuvetur, protegatur and consistat. Et
post hanc aeterna cum eodem beatitudine perfrui merearis Domine (...) and
desideratissime David. His 90. Epistle to him, col. 1618. begins thus. Domine
mi dilect ssime, et dulcissime, et omnium desider antissime mi David, tristis
est Flaccus vester propter infirmit atem vestram. Opto et toto cord Deum
deprecor, ut cito convaleatis, ut gaudium nostrum sit (...) in vobis, et
sanitas vestra sit plena anima et corpore, I shall close with his 24. Epistle
to him, which has this Exordium. Gloria and laus D^o omnipotenti, pro salute
et prosperitate vestra, dulcissime mi David, atque pro omni honor et saptentia
in quibus te speciali gratia omnibus supercellere fecit. Perpetua gratiarum
actio resoner, et assidua sanctarum Intercessio orationum ad Deum dirigatur,
quatenus longaeva prosperitate feliciter vivas, valeas et Regnes ad
correctionem et exaltationem sanctae suae (...), ut sub protectione tuae
venerandae potestatis secura (...) Deo deserviat, etc. And this memorable
conclusion. (...), prosperitas Regni. Tu salus populi. Tu decus Ecclesiae. Tu
omnium protectio fidelium Christi, Nobis igitur sub umbra potentiae, et sub
regimine pietatis tuae, divina concesset gratia Religiosam ducere vitam, atque
summa quiet Deo Christo deservire. Ideo solicita mente, et pia intention, pro
tua prosperitate et salute curam habere et intercedere justum et necestarium
habemus, Domine desiderantissime, atque omni honor dignissime David Rex. I
have at large transcribed these salutations, options, supplications, Prayers,
Intercessions and thanksgivings of our famous Englishman. Abbot Alchuvinus for
6. reasons. 1. Because they are a most full pregnant evidence of his
conscientious observation of the Apostles Exhortation and precept, 1 Timothy 2. 1,
2, 3. and of all other Abbots, Prelates, and Clergymen in that age. 2ly.
Because they are a mo^ exact practical commentary upon that Text. 3ly. An
excellent president for our imitation, and notable censure of the Apostasy,
Disloyalty, and Indevotion of sundry Antimonarchical new Saints, in this
degenerate age. 4ly. A most clear demonstration of the Excellency of Kingly
Government, of the happiness that Christian Churches, Realms, Subjects in joy
under Pious, Religious Kings and Emperors; and what extraordinary cause they
have to pray unto, and to praise and ble^e God for them. 5ly. Because they are
full of Excellent variety, unknown to most, and little taken notice of even by
our learnedest Divines. 6ly. Because they contain the substance of most other
Abbots, Bishops and Clergy-mens salutations, Benedictions, Prayers,
Thanksgivings of this kind in their Epistles to our own and other Kings and
Emperors, in that and succeeding ages, most of which I shall for brevity
pretermit, since presidented in and by these Epistles.

Our Historians record, that about the year 1030. Bryghtwold a monk of
Glastonbury, (first Bishop of Wilton) when King Cnute had banished and almost
extirpated the whole royal Progeny of the English race, to establish himself
and his pos^erity in the Throne, so as there seemed little probability of their
restitution; this Bishop falling into a serious meditation of the forlorn
condition of the Royal race, and the English Nation under the Danish usurpers,
entered into Glastenbury Abbey, where (as Abbot Ailred relates) for the
restitution os the exiled King and royal issue, and deliverance of his Native
Country from Danish Tyranny, maerens et tristis, orationibus vacabat et
Psalmis. Qui cum aliquando pro Regis, plebisque liberatione preces lacrymasque
profunderet, quasi in haec verba prorumpens. Et tu, inquit, Domine usque quo?
usque quo avertis faciem tuam, obliviscens inopiae nostrae and tribulationis
nostrae? Sanctos tuos occiderunt, altaria tua suffoderunt, and non est qui
redimat, neque qui salvum faciat. Scio Domine, scio, quia omnia quae fecisti
nobis, in vero judicio fecisti: sed nunquid in aeternum projiciet Deu^, and non
opponet and complacitus sit adhuc? erit ne Domine Deus meus, erit ne finis
horum mirabilium? aut in aeternum tuus in nos mucro desaeviet, and percutias
usque ad internecionem? Inter preces tandem and lachrymas fatigatum sopor
suavis excepit; viditque per somnium caelestem chorum cum lumine,
beatissimumque Petrum in eminenti loco constitutum, dignum tantae majestati
habitum praeferentem. Videbatur ante eum vir praeclari vultus in forma decenti,
regalibus amictus insigniis, quem cum propriis manibus Apostolus consecrasset
and unxisset in Regem, monita salutis adjecit, praecipueque caelibem vitam
commendans, quot esset annos regnaturus aperuit. Obstupefactus Praesul tanti
novitate miraculi, petit sibi a sancto visionis hujus mysterium revelari: de
statu insuper regni and instantis fine periculi apostolicum exegit oraculum.
Tune sanctus vultu placido intuens intuentem. Domini, inquit, o Praesul, Domini
est regnum, ipse dominatur in filiis hominum. Ipse transfert regna, and mutat
imperia, and propter peccata populi regnare facit hypocritam. Peccatum pecca
vit populus tuus Domino, and tradidit eos in manus Gentium and dominati sunt
etiam qui oderunt eos. Sed non obliviscitur misereri Deus, nec continebit in
ira sua misericordias suas. Erit enim, cum dormis cum patribus tuis sepultus in
senectute bona, visitabit Dominus populum suum, and faciet redemtionem plebis
suae. Eliget enim sibi virum secundum cor suum qui faciet omnes voluntates
suas^ qui me opitulante regnum adeptus Anglorum, Danico furor^ finem imponet.
Erit enim acceptus Deo and gratus hominibus, amabilis civibus, terribilis
hostibus, utilis Ecclesiae. Qui cum praescriptum terminum regnandi in justicia
and pace compleverit, laudabilem vitam sancto fine concludet. Quae omnia in
beato Edwardo completa rei exitus comprobavit; Expergefactus Pontifex rursus ad
preces lacrymasque convertitur, et licet faelicit a tem suae gentis non esset
ipse visurus, de malorum tamen fine certus effectus, gratias agens Deo plurimum
gratulabitur: Factus igitur animaequior, populis paenitentiam praedicabat,
quibus Deus misericordiam non defutur am constantissime pollicebatur.

Most of our Historians record, That St. Peter in this vision showed Edward the
Confessor to Bryghtwold whiles he was an exile in Normandy, and anointed him
King in his sight, declaring to him the honesty of his life and peaceablenesse
of his Reign, which should continne for 22. years space. After which he
inquiring of St. Peter who should succeed him? received this comfortable Answer
from him worthy our confideration, REGNUM ANGLIAe EST REGNUM DEI, and IPSE SIBI
REGES PROVIDEBIT: as he has done ever since; and that especially by the
constant Prayers, Supplications and Intercessions of the Ministers, Clergy, and
people of the Realm in all Ages.

Queen Emma (Mother of King Edward the Confessor) Anno 1050.
being falsely accused of Incontinency with Aldwin Bishop of Winchester, and
other crimes, and enforced to make her purgation in Winchester Church, by going
barefoot over 9. plough-shares red hot; the King her Son, Nobles, Bishops, and
People resorting thither upon this occasion. When the Queen was led to this
torment between 2. Bishops only, Totius populi, clerique quasi una voce
ululantis, S. Swithinum invocantis and exclamantis, S. Swithine libera eam:
maximus fletus paene ad ^oelos elatus est, tantusque clamoris sonitus vocibus
viribusque omnium factus est, ut S. Swithinus vel ilico sine mora, vel nunquam
occurreret, ut tonitrua reboantia superavit, credebant enim illa sua
vociferatione Deum ipsum vim pati, coactumque servum suum Suithinum qua^
violenter extractum a coelo, ad liberandam Reginam dimissurum. After which
strong fervent united Prayers and cries of the People and Clergy to God for
her, the Queen miraculously passed over all these Plough-shares, which she
pressed with the weight of her whole Body, without seeing the Iron, or feeling
the burning, or receiving the least hurt thereby.

King Edw. the ^onfessor, having founded and endowed Anno 1066.
the Church of St. Peter of Westminster with sundry Lands and privileges
amongst other ends, pro animabus Regum tam Successorum quam Praedecessorum

prosperitate totius Anglorum Popult; for all which the Monks thereof were to
make contiuual Prayers, Supplications, and Intercessions unto God: Pope
Nicholas thereupon confirmed by his Bull, the privileges which the King had
granted to this Church by his Charters; which Bull begins with this Salutation,
and proceeds with this Thanksgiving and Prayer for him unto God.

confirmet vos in paterno solio ac propria Haereditate (a most seasonable Prayer
for our present exiled hereditary King, as well as for King Edward the
Confessor, who after above ( Spelm. Council. p. 628. Ailredus Abbas: De vita et

) 25. years dispossession of the Crown by the tyrannical invading Danish (...),
was by their deaths restored to the ^rown in peace by his Subjects, without the
least eff^sion of blood, for which mercy herepaired and re-founded this Abbey,
as his first Charter to it recites) Uestro desiderio and voluntati Omnipotens
Deus praestet effectum, et con^met vobis paterni Regni Imperium, et tribuat
Inc^ementum, et post praesentis vitae Decursum, perduca^ ad aeternum
permanentis Gloriae Imperium.

This King in his Epistle to this Pope, to confirm these privileges (recorded
by Col. 378.
Ailredus) has this passage concerning Peterpence, which engaged the Pope
particularly to pray for him and his Realm. Ego quoque pro modulo meo, augeo
and confi^mo donationes and consuetudines pe^uniarum quas sanctus Petrus habet
in Anglia, and ipsas pecunias collectas cum Regalibus donis mitto vobis, ut
oretis pro me, et pro pace Regni mei, et continuam e^ sollempnem memoriam
instituatis totius Gentis Anglicae coram corporibus sanctorum Apostolorum: And
if the Pope thus prayed continually for this King, his Realm and People, upon
this account, no doubt his own Bishops, Clergy, and other Subjects did much
more do it.

( Monast. Angl. p. 547.
) King William the first in his Charter of confirmation Anno 1096.
of Lands and Liberties to the Church of Derherst, Anno 1069. granted them by
King Edward the Confessor his Predecessor, that they might pray, pro salute

) Henry the first by sundry Charters during his reign granted and confirmed
sundry Lands and Liberties to the Abbeys, Priories, and Churches of Malverne,
Colum, Bermondsey, Lenton, Thetford, Mountacute, St. Andrews, Northampton,
Barnstaple, and others besides, to pray, pro salute and r^demptione animae

To which end they constantly made Prayers for them. And W^lliam Peverel, one of
his Subjects, pro divini cultus am^re and communi remedio animarum Dominorum
meorum Willielmi ^egis, et uxoris ejus Matildis Reginae, et filii eorum

and Officers to our Kings, to endow Monasteries and Churches with Lands, to
pray for the spiritual and temporal prosperity of the Persons, Souls, and
Realms of their Kings, Queens, their Sons, Children and Successors in the first
place, as well as for their own Souls, Wives, Childr^ns, and Posterities,
mentioned only in the second and last place in their Charters and Endowments,

Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury begins his Epistles to this King Henry during

regnet in ^orde vestro ut vos per eundem regnetis in gratia ejus. Omnipotens
Deus sic in hoc et in aliis actibus vestris dirigv ac vestrum secundum
voluntatem suam, ut post hanc vitam perducat Vos ad gloriam suam. Amen. In his
Commentary and Exposition on the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. He presses the Duty of
praying for Kings, though Pagans and Persecutors in these words, Hujusmodi
preces siant pro omnibus hominibus, etc. Et pro illis etiam de quibus minus
videbatur, id est, Pro Regibus, licet sint mali et sanctis infesti: pro omnibus
qui in sublimitate secularium potestatum positi sunt, sicut Consules et D^ces,
quia de omni genere hominum convertentur ad religionem, et perveniant ad
salutem, et de eis qui fastu et elatione secularis potentiae fidem et
humilitatem videntur abhorrere; ^cut cernimus, Quod ipst Reges, desertis
Idolis, pro quibus persequebantur Christianos, unum verum Deum cognoverunt et
colunt, et ideo pro illis orandum fuit, cum etiam persequerentur Ecclestam; ad
hoc etiam orandum est pro Principibus, ut nos qui sub illis sumus vitam agamus
quietam a persecutione, ut conversis Principibus Gentiles non audeant
inquietare nos movendo persecutiones pro impietate idolatriae, nec haeretici
tranquillitatem nostram turbare praesumant volentes corrumpere castitatem fidei
quorundam. In pace Principum quies et regnum servatur Ecclesiarum. Nam in
bellis et discordiis eorum dissipatur tranquillitas, tepefcit pietas, solvitur
Disciplina vel districtio. Qua soluta, infirmiorum castitas violatur. Et ideo
pro his orandum est, ne eveniant haec per dissentionem Principum: Unde et per
Jeremiam Dominus. Judaeis qui in Babylone captivitenebantur, praecepit dicens,
Quaerite pacem civitatis ad quam transmigrare ^os fecit, et orate pro ea ad
Dom. quia in pace illius erit par v^bis. Babylon vero (quae dicitur confusio)
Societate^ iniquorum significat, Judaei aute^ cives supernae Jerusalem qui in
hoc seculo pe^egrinantur inter malos, et Regibus atque Principibus tributa
xeddant, et ^aetera quae salvo Dei cultu constitutio secularis exigit. Idcirco
debet orare pro pace eorum, quia in pace eorum erit illis pax: ^tique interim
temporalis, quae bonis malisque communis est. Utimur ergo et nos pace
Babylonis, ex qua per fidem et coe^stis patriae d^siderium ita populus Dei
laetabitur, ut apud hanc interim peregrinetur. Pax autem nostra propria et b^um
Deo est per fidem, and in aeternum cum illo per speciem. Orate (inquit) pro
pace Principum, et pro salute omnium, quia hoc agere est bonum, id est, utile
Ecclesiae, and acceptum, id est, gratum atque placitum coram Deo salvatore
nostro: qui-s^ut nos salvat, ita and omnes homines vult salvos fieri, and ad
agnitionem veritatis venire, etc. Omne genus hominum intelligan^us per

to all the religious persons remaining within the circuit of London, where the
said Edward lay sick, ut (...) orarent pro Pueri incolumitate^ that they should
devoutly pray for the recovery and health of the child. Whereupon, amongst
others, he writ specially to the Abbot and Covent of St. Alban, ut pro ipso
orantes, that praying for him, all the Monks should solemnly sing a Mass,
whose first Collect should be of St. Alban, but the second for the sick Prince:
namely, Omnipotens and sempiterne Deus salus aeterna credentium, etc Which
being done, per Dei gratiam, puero sanitas est restituta. Haec idcirco dixerim
(writes the Historian) propter murmur populi dicentis, ecce laici orant Dominum

Monks of Westminster fearing to lose such a Patriot, went in Pilgrimage
barefoot, in a rainy season to the new Temple, and there singing a Mass for
the King, and returning thence in the same manner as they went, it was told
them, that the King had recovered of his sickness. Whereupon he commanded the
Monks by his Mandates, that they should ^ing Gaude at in coelis, quod convaluit

in England as in other Kingdoms, during the reign of King Henry the 3d. and in
the Kings reigns preceding and succeeding him) which I shall here insert.

Deus qui populis tuis virtute consulis, and amore dominaris, da huic f^mule
tuo spiritum sapientiae cum regimine disciplinae, ut tibi toto cord devotus,
in Regni regimine maneat semper idoneus; tuoque munere ipsius temporibus
securitas Ecclesiae dirigatur, ut in tranquillitate devotio Christiana
permaneat. ut in bonis operibus perseverans, ad aeternum Regnum te duce valeat
pervenire, per eundem Dominum.

Omnipotens sempiterne Deus qui famulum tuum Regni fastigis dignatus es
sublimare, tribue ei quaesumus ut ita in hujus seculi cursu in commune salutem
disponat, quatenus a tuae veritatis tramite non recedat. Per eundem Dominum
nostrum.

Deus qui scis humanum genus nulla virtute posse subsistere, concede propicius,
Ut famulus tuus N quem populo tuo voluisti praeferri, ita tue fulciatur
adjutorio quatenus quibus potui praeesse, valeat and prodesse Per Dominum.

Omnipotens sempiterne Deus coelestium terrestriumque moderator, qui famutuum
N. ad Regni fastigium dignatus es provehere, concede propitius, ut a cunctis
adversitatibus libertatus, and Ecclesiasticae pacis dono muniatur, and ad
aeternae pacis gaudia te donante pervenire mereatur. Per Dominum nostrum.

Quaesumus Omnipotens Deus, ut famulus tuus N. qui tua miseratione suscepti
Regni gubernacula, virtutum etiam omnium a te percipiat incrementa, quibus
decenter armatus, and vitiorum monstra devitare, and hostem superare, and ad te
qui via, veritas and vita es, gratiosus valeat pervenire. Per Dominum nostrum.

Deus in cujus manu corda sunt Regum, inclina ad preces humilitatis nostrae
aures misericordiae tuae, and f^mulo tuo Imperatori nostro regimen tuae appone
sapientiae, ut haustis de tuo font eonsiliis, and tibi placeat, and super
omnia Regna praecellat. Per Dominum nostrum.

Deus cujus Regnum est omnium seculorum, supplicationes nostras clementer
exaudi, and Christianorum Regnum tibi subditum protege, ut in tua virtute
fidentes, and tibi placeaut, and super omnia Regna praecellant. Per eundem
Dominum nostrum.

Deus qui providentia tua coelestia simul and terrena moderaris, propiciare
Christianorum rebus and Regibus; ut omnis hostium fortitudo te pro nobis
pugnante frangatur. Per eundem Domiuum nostrum.

Propiciare Domine precibus famulorum tuorum: and propter Nomen tuum Christiani
nominis defend Rectores: ut falus servientium tibi Principum, pax tuorum
possit esse populorum. Per eundem Dominum.

Deus Regnorum omnium Regumque Dominator, qui nos and percutiendo (...), and
ignoscendo conservas, praetende misericordiam tuam, ut tranquillitate pacis tua
potestate firmata, ad remedia correctionis utamur. Per Dom. nostrum.

These were the constant public and private prayers and Devotions of the
Clergy and people for their Kings, Princes, and their Kingdoms heretofore, not
unseasonable for our present times.

In my perusal of the Clause Rolls in the Tower of London, I have observed
sundry Memorable Writs and Mandates issued by King Edward the 1, 2, 3. ^ichard
the 2. and other of our Kings, to their Bishops, Clergy, Abbots, Freers
Predicants, Minors, and other Religious Orders, upon sundry emergent occasions,
requiring and commanding them, to make frequent and fervent Supplications,
Prayers, I^tercessions, and Thanksgivings unto God alone, (not Saints, or
Angels) in times of War, danger, Treaties, and the like, for his special
assistance, direction, protection, blessing, and favor, upon the King, Queen,
Prince of Wales, the Royal issue, kingdom, Nobles, Armies, the Kings Counsels,
Treaties, affairs of all sorts, and for public peace and prosperity: Which
Writs, because very rare, pious, pertinent to my present Theme, suitable to the
state of our affairs, and never hitherto published in print, I shall here
insert the chiefest of them at large, pretermitting all others of like nature
for brevitie sake, those here transcribed comprehending in them the form and
substance of the residue, except only Writs for Masses, Dirgees, and Prayers
for deceased Kings, Queens, and Princes, of which there are ( Cl. 19 E. 1.

King Richard the 2d. in the 22. year of his reign, confirmed by his Charter to
the Abbey of Graces near the Tower of London, founded by King Edward his
GrandFather, sundry Lands and Tenements, in respect of the various dangers to
which he and the Kingdom were in humane reason exposed to, by Land and Sea,
beyond recovery. Ad Missas et alia divina officia singulis diebus ce^ebrandas
et faciendas in Abbatia praedicta pro salubri statu et prosperitate Nostra dum
vixerimus, Et pro anima nostra dum ab hac luce migraverimus, and pro anima
ejusdem A^i nostri specialiter, and animabus omnium aliorum Progenitorum
Haeredum and Successorum nostrorum and omnium fideli^ defunctorum in perpetuum.
And Michael de la Poole, founded the Monastery at Kingston upon Hull, confirmed
by King Richard the 2d. granting sundry Lands to the Prior, Monks and their
successors upon this condition; Volumus itaque and ordinamus, quod praefati
Prior and Monachi and eorum successores habeant specialiter in Missis,
orationibus, and aliis divi^ serviciis recommendatum, statum nobilistimi Domini
Regis Ricardi praedicti. and nostrum, (and of several others particularly
mentioned) dum vixerimus, and cum ab hac luce migraverimus, orent, celebrent
and celebrari facient pro animabus nostris, ac specialiter et continue pro
anima dicti Domini nostri Regis Edwardi defuncti, and of several others
particularly mentioned, and pro quibus orare tenemur, et omnium fidelium
defunctorum.

I could add many more Writs and Mandates, of the former nature, upon
extraordinary Occasions, out of the Clause Rolls of King John, Hen. the 3d.
Edw. the 3d. Henry the 4, 5, and 6. Edward 4. H. 7, 8. Edward 6. Queen
Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles; which because they would rather surfit
than delight or instruct the Readers, I shall wholly pretermit.

King Henry the 5th. founded a Monaste^ie at Shene, the grounds and ends
whereof he thus expressed in his Pat. 3. and 4 H. 5. m. 8 Pat. 2. H 6. pa^ 4.
m. 27. Monast. Angl p. 974. 975.
Charter. Cum excelsae Majestatis exennia quae gloriam nostri regiminis de die
in diem ubertim, ut ipsi videmus, extollant, rite a Nobis gratiarum vendicant
actiones, justissimum credimus ut eo medio in auctorem tendant quo nobis ab
auctore fluxerunt, nomine Salvatoris; ut sicut per Mediatorem Dei et hominum
Dominum Jesum ad Nos indignos, de paetre luminum, bona cuncta procedunt, ita
nostrae lauds quamvis inutiles per cundem Jesum Christum et datorem gratiarum,
and omnis boni principium revertantur. Whereupon he granted and confirmed for
him and his Heirs sundry Lands to this Monastery free from all secular exaction
and service, Pro (...) et aliis divinis Offictis inibi faciendis pro salubri
statu nostro dum vixerimus, ac anima nostra cum ab hac luce migraverimus, and
animabus parentum and progenitorum nostrorum and omnium fidelium defunctorum:
Necnon pro pace, tranqutilitate et qutete populi et Regni nostri: ac insuper
pro aliis pietatis operibus ibidem sustinendis, ministrandis, et supportandis
juxta ordinationem nostram, haereredum et executorum nostrorum in hac part
before faciendam; which was accordingly executed.

King Edward the 4th. by his Charter of 17 Febr. in the Monasticon Angl. p. 179.
first year of his Reign, granted the Priory of Shirburn to the Hospital of St.
Julian called Domus Dei in the Town of Southampton, In augmentationem divinae
cultus infra hospitale nostrum sancti Juliani, etc Necnon ut dilecti Nobis in
Christo Magister Jahannes Pereson, nunc Custos Hospitalis praedicti, acnunc
Capellani et Fratres ejusdem Hospitalis, ac successores sui, pro salubri statu

Potte^ spiry and Eggemond to the Priory and Covent of St. Anne by Coventre
founded by his Ancestors, Ut iidem Prior and Conventus, Pro bono statu nostro,

year of King Henry the 8th but generally used throughout England some hundreds
of years before) f. 12. there is this set form of Prayer for the King of
England for the time being.

Deus regnorum et Christiani maxim Protector Imperii, Da Servo tuo H. Regi
nostro de Host triumphum, ut qui tua providentia extitit Coronatus, tuo semper
munimine tutus sit et securus, per Christum Dominum nostrum.

and formerly publicly used in all Processions for our successive Kings. Domine
salvum sac Regem. Regem nostrum ac Principes, etc. in omni sanctitate custodi.
Salvum fac Regem n stram Famulum tuum: Et exaudi nos in die quo (...) (...) te.
All our ancient Missals, Offices, Hours, Primers, in times of Popery,
containing the like Prayers, and such as I have formerly recited out of Here p.
40.
Cassander his Preces Eeclesiasticae, together with Prayers for their Souls
after their deaths: which according to the modern use of the Church of Rome are
popish, vain, sinful, superstitious, implying and presupposing a Purgatory:
but according to their primitive use and institution, pious and religious,
importing no purgatory at all, as learned Bishop Usher proves at large in his
Answer to the Jesuits Challenge, of Prayers for the Dead, p. 194 to 264. to
which I refer the Reader ^or fuller satisfaction herein, and concerning the
forementioned Prayers for, and Charters of our Kings to Monasteries to pray for
their own, their Ancestors, Saccessors, Heirs, and others Souls when departed
out of this World.

I could add many Prayers made for King Henry the ^th. in sundry Epistles and
Dedications of Books unto him, but for brevity I shall omit all but 3. The 1.
is Pope Leo the 10th. his Bull to him in the 22. year of his Reign, sub^cribed
with all the Cardinals Hands; wherein he conferred on him the Title of Defender
of the Faith, for w^iting a Book against Luther, in defense of Pardous, the
Papacy, and 7. Sacraments, which Bull begins thus.

with this Benediction and Prayer for him and his Posterity Perpetuum hoc and
immortale gloriae tuae monumentum Posteris tuis relinquere, illisque viam

ut judicium quod de ipsa fecimus eam tam insigni titulo decorantes, a nemine
falsum aut vanum judicari possit. Demum mortatis bujus vitae finito curriculo
sempiternae illius gloriae consortem atque participem reddat.

The 2 is William Wraghton (an acute Protestant Writer) who in his Epistles to
King Henry the 8th. before his two Books, entitled, The Hunting of the Romish
Fox, printed at Basyl, 1543. And his Reseuing of the Romish Fox, against
Stephen Gardner, printed 1545. Wishes him prosperity both of Body and Soul,
closing his last Epistle to him with this Prayer. God grant you health both of
Body and Soul, victory over your Enemies, and Grace to do in this our matter of
Religion as shall be most to the Glory of God, and the profit of the
Commonwealth, Amen; And he closes his last Treatise with this Prayer, God
save the King.

The third is our learned Protestant Divine, Thomas Beacon, who in his In his
work; in Folio, London 1564. v^l. 1. p. 96.
Pathway unto Prayer (dedicated to the Lady Anne Gray) chapter 55. has this Godly
exhortation to all private Christians. Let u^ flee to God at all times with
h^mble Obsecrations and hearty Requests Let our Prayers be continual. Let us in
all our Prayers seek the glory of God, the advancement of his most blessed
word, and the health of our own Souls. Let us pray for the preservation of the
Kings most excellent Majesty ( H. 8.) and for the prosp^rous success of his
^ntirely-beloved Son, Edward, our Prince, that most Angel-like Impe. Let us
pray for all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal: specially for those that have
the regiment of the Publick-weal under the Kings Graces Highness. Let us pray
for the Ministers of Gods Word, that they may freely speak the truth of Christ's
Gospel, as it becomes them. Let us pray for all men universally, chiefly for
the Inhabitants of this Realm of England, That they may all bear a faithful
heart both toward God and our King.

Upon the Reformation of Religion, and abolishing of Anno 1557.
Popish Missals, Psalters, Hours, (...), and Portuasses by King Edward the
sixth in his Parliament 2 and 3 Edw. 6. chapter 10. the King by advice of his
Convocation and Parliament, commanded A Book of Common Prayer and
Administration of the Sacraments in the English Tongue, to be used in all
Churches and Chapels throughout the Realm, by the Statutes of 2 E. 6 c. 1. and
5, and 6 E. 6. c. 1. Wherein there was not only a Prayer for the King in the
Letany, but in a special Collect, agreeing in substance with those in our later
Books of Common Prayer, hereafter cited. In this pious Kings reign, the Bishops
and Ministers in their Epistles and Dedications to him, and in their Prayers
before and after their Sermons, usually prayed most heartily and particularly
for his long life, religious and prosperous reign, and spiritual, temporal, and
eternal felicity. And John Bale Bishop of Ossery, in his Image of both
Churches, or Paraphrase upon St. John's Revelation, printed 1550. in the Iast
page thereof, exhorts all Gods meek-spirited Servants in their daily Prayer,
before all other to remember that most worthy Minister of God, King Edward the
sixth, which has so sore wounded the Beast, that he may throw all his
Superstition into the bottomless lake again, (from whence they have comen) to
the comfort of his People.

Our learned In his works vol 2. f. 63, 67.
Thomas Beacon in his Preface to The Flower of Godly Prayers, dedicated to Anne
Duchess of Somerset, as he does exceedingly bless God for the extraordinary
zeal and piety of King Edward the 6th. in delivering his Realm from
Antichristian Tyranny and Popery, reforming the Church, propagating true
religion, and in giving us this most worthy Prince to be our King: So he has
this particular Ibid. sol. 173.
Prayer for the King, to be used by all private Christians daily in their
respective Families and Closets with zeal and devotion.

Almighty God, 1 Timothy 6. Apoc. 18. 19. Deuteronomy. 17. Josh. 1. Romans 13 ^ Tim. 2.
Tit. 3. ^ Pet. 2. cap. 6, and 9.
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, which by thy divine ordinance have appointed
Temporal Rulers to govern thy People, according to equity and justice, and to
live among them as a loving Father among his natural Children, unto the
advancement of the good, and punishment of the evil, we most humbly beseech
thee favorably to behold Edward thy Servant, our King and Governor, and to
breath into his heart through thy holy Spirit, that Wisdom, that is ever about
the Throne of thy Majesty, whereby he may be provoked, moved, and stirred to
love, fear and serve thee, to seek thy glory, to banish Idolatry, Superstition,
and Hypocrisy out of this his Realm, and unfeignedly to avance thy holy and
pure Religion among us his Subjects, unto the example of other foreign Nations.
O Lord defend him from his enemies, send him long and prosperous life among us,
and give him grace not only in his own Person, godly and justly to rule, but
also to appoint such Magistrates under him, as may be likewise affected both
toward thy holy Word, and toward the Common-we^l; that his Subjects living
under his Dominion in all godliness, peace and wealth, may pass the time of
this our short pilgrimage in thy fear and service, unto the glory of thy
blessed name, which alone is worthy all honor for ever and ever. Amen.

Next after this, follow^ one Prayer for the Kings Council. And after that, (
Ibid. f. 188, 189.
) a Prayer for the common peace and quietness of all Realms: very seasonable
for our times. And in his ( Ibid. f. ^11.
) Pomaunder of Prayer, he has this Prayer of Subjects or Commons.

As it is thy godly appointment, O Lord God, ( S^p. 6. Romans 13. 1 Timothy 6 Tit.
2. 1 Pet. 2. Acts 10. Rom, 11.
) That some should bear rule in the world to see thy Glory set forth, and the
common peace kept, so is it thy pleasure again, that some should be Subjects
and Inferiors to others in their vocation, although before thee there is no
respect of Persons. And for as much as it is thy good will, to appoint me in
the number of Subjects, I beseech thee to give me a faithful and an obedient
heart unto the High Powers, that there may be found in me no Disobedience, no
Unfaithfullnesse, no Treason, no Falsehood, no Dissimulation, no Insurrection,
no Commotion, no Conspiracy, nor any kind of Rebellion in Word or Deed against
the Civil Magistrates: But all Faithfulness, Quietness, Subjection, Humility,
and whatsoever else becomes a Subject; That I living here ( Mat. 24. Luc. 18.
Mar. 10^
) in all lowlynesse of mind, may at the last day, through thy favor be lifted
up into everlasting Glory, wh^re ^hou, with the Father and the Holy Ghost
live and reignest very God for ever. Amen.

These were the Godly, Loyal, fervent, daily public and private Prayers of
Protestant Ministers and Subjects for King Edward the 6th. in that Age.

Queen Mary, a Popish Prince, succeeding King Edward, Anno 1554.
set aside the Book of Common Prayer, and introduced Popish Missals,
Proc^ssionals, Hours, Primers, and Popery again, wherein they publicly prayed
for her in the forecited manner under our Popish King^; her zealous Protestant
Bishops, Ministers, and Subjects likewise making fervent constant Prayers for
her: But some over-zealous, Anabaptistical Fanatics using some unchristian
expressions in their Prayers against her, ( Fox Acts and Monuments, vol. 3. p.
114.
) That God would cut her off, and shorten her days, of which there was
complaint made in Parliament; Whereupon there was this special Act made against
such Prayers, Anno 1555. 1, and 2 Phil. and Mar. ch 9.

Forasmuch as now of late diverse noughty, seditious, Anno 1555.
malicious, and heretical persons, not having the fear of God before their
eyes; who in a divellish sort, contrary to the duty of their Allegiance,
congregated themselves together in Conventicles, in diverse and sundry profane
places within the City of London, esteeming themselves to be in the true Faith,
where indeed they are in Errors and Heresies, and out of the true trade of
Christ's Catholic Religion, and in the same places at several times using their
fantastical and schismatical services, have of their most malicious and wicked
Stomachs prayed against the Queens Majesty, That God would turn her Heart from
Idolatry to the true Faith (which was good and Christian) or else to shorten
her days, or take her quickly out of the way. Which Prayer was never heard or
read to have been used by any good Christian man, against any Prince, though he
were a Pagan and Infidel, and much less against any Christian Prince, and
especially so virtuous a Princess as our Sovereign Lady that now is, is known
to be, etc. For reformation whereof it is enacted, That every such person and
persons which since the beginning of this Parliament have by express words and
sayings, prayed, required or desired, or hereafter shall pray by express words
or sayings, That God would shorten her days, or take her out of the way (whose
life Almighty God long preserve) or any such like malicious Prayer, amounting
to the same effect, their Promoters and Abetters therein, shall be taken,
reputed and judged Traitors, and every such praying, requiring and desiring,
shall be judged, taken and reputed High Treason. And the Offenders therein,
their Procurours and Abetters being thereof lawfully convict, according to the
Laws of this Realm, shall have, suffer and forfeit as in Cases of High Treason.

Provided always, and be it enacted, that if any Person or Persons shall be
indicted for any the offenses aforesaid, done and perpetrated during this
Session of this present Parliament, and upon his or their arraignment, shall
show him or themselves penitent for their offense, and submit him or themselves
to the Kings and Queens mercy, and humbly desire the same, before such Justices
or Commissioners before whom he or they shall be arraigned, that then no
judgment of conviction, or attaindour of Treason, shall be given against any
such Person or Persons, so being penitent and submitting themselves. And in
every such case, the Justices or Commissioners before whom such Person or
Persons shall be arraigned, shall have authority by virtue of this Act, to
prescribe, adjudge and appoint such corporal punishment, other than death, to
such offender and offenders, as to them by their discretion shall seem
convenient; and upon that penance prescribed and done, to be discharged of the
said Treason, comprised in that Judgment.

These prayers were much against and directly contrary to the Judgment of (
See Arch bishop ^ranmers life, in Antiq. Eccles. Brit. Godwin, and before his
Answer to Stephen ^a (...). Fox Acts and Monu. ments ^ol. 3. p. 101 102.
) Archbishop Cranmer, Bishop Farrer, Bishop Hooper, Rowland Tailor, John
Philpot, John Bradford, Edward Crome, John Rogers, Laurence Saunders, Edward
Laurence, Miles Coverdale Bishop of ^xon, and other of our godly Protestant
Bishops and Ministers, who soon after suffered as Martyrs; they in their Letter
the 8. of May Anno Dom. 1554. professing, That as obedient Subjects we shall
behave our selves toward Queen Mary, and all that be in Authority, and not
cease to pray to God for them, that he would govern them all, generally and
particularly, with the spirit of wisdom and grace, and so we heartily desire,
and humbly pray all men to do, in no point consenting to any kind of rebellion
or sedition against our Sovereign Lady the Queens Highness: but where they
cannot obey, but they must disobey God, there to submit themselves with all
patience and humility, to suffer as the will and pleasure of the higher powers
shall adjudge: as we are ready through the goodness of the Lord, to suffer
whatsoever they shall adjudge us unto. And Bishop Hooper writ an Apolo^y
against the slanderous Report made of him, that he should encourage and
maintain such as cursed Qu. Mary, printed 1552. wherein his innocence and
loyalty to the Queen, in praying for her, are vindicated at large.

In this Parliament Fox Act^ and Monuments. vol. ^. p. 11^. 115. 11^.
there being a general opinion that Queen Mary was with child by King Philip
her husband, there was a special Act made, that in case Queen Mary should die,
during her child's Minority, that King Philip should have the education and
protection of him: In which Act. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons
assembled in Parliament, have firm hopes and confidence by the goodness of
Almighty God, that he will of his infinite goodness give the Queens Majesty
and Highness strength, the rather by our continual prayers, so pass well the
danger of deliverance of Child, etc. Upon this occasion, the Popish Bishops,
Clergy, and Churchmen, made many Processions, Masses, Collects and Prayers, to
be daily said in all Churches for Qu. Maryes safe deliverance and her issue,
recorded at large by Mr. Fox, where you may peruse them: in one of which
prayers there were these expressions. Give unto our Queen thy servant, a little
infant in fashion and body, comely and beautiful, in pregnant wit, notable and
excellent. Grant the same to be in obedience like Abraham, in chastity and
Brotherly love like Joseph, in meekness and mildness like Moses, in strength
and valor like Sampson: let him be found faithful as David, after thy heart;
let him be wise among Kings, as the most wise Solomon; let him be like Job, a
simple and an upright man, fearing God and eschewing evil; let him finally be
garnished with the comeliness of all virtuous conditions, and in the same let
him wax old and live, that he may see his Childrens Children to the third and
fourth generation. And give unto our Sovereign Lord and Lady King Philip, and
Queen Mary, thy blessings, and long-life upon earth, and grant that of them may
come kings and Queens, which may steadfastly continue in faith, love and
holiness. And blessed be their seed of our God, that all Nations may know,
thou art only God in all the earth, which art bl^ssed for ev^r and ever. Amen.

After Queen Mary's decease, Anno 1558. Masses and Anno 1550.
Popish Prayers being again abolished, and the Book of Common Prayer restored
by the Parliament of 1 Eliz. chapter 2. there were the same prayers publicly used
for the Queen, both in the Letany and Collects, as were formerly used for King
Edward; and in sundry Books dedicated to her Majesty, and Prayers published
during Her reign, there were many loyal and zealous P^ayers, Supplications and
Intercessions, made to God for her long life and Prosperous reign, over-tedious
to recite at large, and vulgarly known; and in all or most Prayers, Morning and
Evening, for Private Families and Christians, there were special Petitions to
God for her Majesty, some of them being Printed with the Bibles themselves,
then in use; and likewise at the end of most Quarto Bibles under King James,
and King Charles. I shall touch only upon some few presidents of many.

In the 2. year of her reign, John Veron, (Divinity Lecturer An^o 1564.
at Paul's) in the close of his Dedicatory Epistle to Her Majesty, before his
Fruitful Treatise of Predestination, prays thus. Christ Jesus of his tender
mercy and goodness, vouchsafe to defend and preserve your most Gracious
Highness, from all your Enemies, and with his holy Spirit, so to fill,
strengthen and comfort your Princely heart, that ye may at all times boldly set
forth his glory, and maintain it to your lives end. Which the Lord long
continue to his Honor.

In the 7th. year of Queen Elizabeth, there was a Collection Anno 1569.
of Prayers in Latin, entitled Preces privatae, printed by William Seres, and
published by the Q^eens special Privilege and Authority; wherein not only the
Duty of Subjects is set down, out of Mat. 22. 17. Romans 13. 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3.
Tit. 3. 1. and 1 Pet. 2. but these special Prayers, Psalms and Hymns made to
God, to be used daily in private Closets and Families for the Queen.

Domine Pater coelestis, Rex Regum and Dominus Dominantium, omnium Principum
gubernator and rector, intimis votis te suppliciter quaesumus Reginam nostram
Elizabetham, benigno vultu (...), eique singulari gratia and ^piritu sancto ita
semper ^ssistere digneris, ut voluntatem tuam ubique exequatur, and secundum
saluberimam normam mandatorum tuorum, omnem vitam transigat. Accumula in illam
coelestia tua dona, ut diu feliciter Nobis imperet, Hosts fortiter devincat,
tandemque in C^lesti gloria vivat in aeternum, qui vivis and regnas Deu^, per
omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen. After which follow the same Prayers for her in
Latin in the Letany, as in the English Letany in the Book of Common Prayer: And
the same Collects for her in Latin, as for her and the King in English. Then
there ensue, Psalmi selecti and peculiares pro Rege vel Regina, to wit, Psalm
20, and 21, and 72. applied to the King and Queen literally, with Domine
salvum fac Regem, and exaudi nos in die in qua invocaverimus. After that
Precatio d exemplum orationis Salomonis, pro Regina.

Domine Deus qui serenissimam nostram Reginam super nos regnare fecisti, eamque
in medio populi tui, ut in aequitate Nos regat and in cordis integritate
subditos suos judicet constituisti: Mitte illi quaeso de coelis sanctis tui^,
and a sede majestatis tuae assistricem tuam sapientiam, ut ei semper adsit, and
apud eam perpetuo resideat, ut sciat quod tibi acceptum sit. Dies praeterea
super Dies ejus adj^cito, eique tam benign Principali tua gratia adesto, ut
and in hac vita grata sint tibi opera ejus, and in futuro tecum regnet in omnem
aeternitatem, per Christum Dominum et Servatorem nostrum. Amen.

Salvam fac Domine Reginam, nec unquam avertas faciem faciem ab ea. Uitam
longaevam tribu^ illi: et sub umbra ^uarum alarm protege eam. Amen.

After these follow this Prayer, Pro Christianis Magistratibus.

Misericors Deus ac Coelestis pater, in cujus manu est omnis terrena potestas
and Magistratus, per te constitutos, ad supplicium malorum, and defensionem
bonorum; in eujus potenti dextera ^ita sunt omnia jura and leges imperatorum,
Te supplices oramus pro Principe nostro, proque eis qui sunt ei a consiliis,
and qui rempublicam administrant, ut gladium ipsis per te commissum, in fide
vera and timore Dei recte gerant, eoque pro tua voluntate and jussu utantur.
Obumbret eos virtus and sapientia Altissimi. Illuminet and conservet eos in
amore Dei divina tua gratia. Da illis o Domine sapientiam and intellectum.
Concede quietam gubernationem, ut omnes subditos in veritate sidei, dilectione
and justitia, quae tibi cordi sit, regant, and dicto audientes conservent.
Proroga ipsis Dies vilae suae, et annos multos largire, ut prospera and laudata
ipsorum functione, nomen tuum and sanctificetur and laudetur in omne aevum.
Amen.

Toward the end of the Book follow certain Latin Prayers and Graces to be used
before and after meals, to which there is this Conclusion added. Gratiarum
actiones a Cibo, semper concludantur hac precatiuncula: Deus (...) Ecclesiam,
Regem vel Reginam custodiat, Consiliarios ejus regat, populum universum
tueatur, and pacem Nobis donet perpetuam. Amen. In imitation whereof this
Prayer was commonly used in all Colleges, Schools, Hospitals, Families
throughout the Realm, in their Graces after every Meal. GOD SAVE his Church,
our King, Queen, (Prince, the rest of the Royal Issue, when there were such
living) and Realms. God send us Peace in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The like Prayers in English for the Queen to be used in in Christian Families,
we^e published by John Field, in his Prayers and Meditations for the use of
private Families, 1581. The Kings Psalms, and Queens Prayers, 1590. in
Christian private prayers by Edw. Deering 1590. in the (...) of ^rayers, set
o^t ^y John Rogers, Anno 1591. in (...) Prayers set out by Henry Bull, Anno
1592. in Tho. Sampsons Prayers 1592. with sundry others. But I shall close up
all with Bishop Jewels Prayer for the Quee^s Majesty, in his Epistle to her
prefixed to his Apology of the Church of England, printed 1570. and after
reprinted. God evermore inflame and direct your Majesty with his holy Spirit,
that the zeal of his House may sincerely devour your Gracious heart, that you
may safely walk in the ways of your Father David, that you may utterly abandon
all Groves and HillAltars, That you may live an old Mother in Israel, that you
may see an end of all Distractions, and stablisht Peace and Unity in the Church
of God. Amen. And with the Prayer of Doctor Thomas Bilson, in the close of his
Epistle to her Majesty before his Books of, The true difference between
Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion, (A very learned and seasonable
Treatise, wherein he produces Page 378.
some Testimonies of Fathers praying for Heretical and persecuting Emperors.)
The King of Kings and Lord of Lords bless and preserve your Majesty; and as he
has begun a good and glorious work in you, and in the Realm by you, so
continue the same by lightening you with his holy Spirit, and defending you
with his mighty Arm, as he has done from the day that he chose you to be the
Leader and Guider of his People, that you may long keep them in truth and peace
by the assi^tance of his Grace, to the praise of his glory, increase of the
Godly, and grief of his and your Subjects. Even so (...) Jesus.

The Clergy of England assembled in Convocation, Anno 1603. the first year of
King James his Reign, in their Constitations and Canons Ecclesiastical then
agreed upon by them, ratified and published by the Kings Authority under his
Great Seal, did thus evidence to the world their loyalty to the King and his
Royal posterity. Can. 1.

As our Duty to the Kings Most excellent Majesty requires, we first decree and
ordain, That the Archbishop of Canterbury, (from time to time) all Bishops of
this Province, or Deans, Archdeacons, Vicars, and all other Ecclesiastical
persons, shall faithfully keep and observe, and (as much as in them lies)
shall cause, to be observed and kept of others, all and singular Laws and
Statutes made for the restoring to the Crown of this Kingdom, the ancient
Jurisdiction over the State Ecclefiastical, and abolishing of all foreign power
repugant to the same. Furthermore, all Ecclesiastical persons having cure of
Souls, and all other Preachers, and Readers of Divinity Lectures, shall to the
uttermost of their wit, knowledge and learning, purely and sincerely (without
any color or dissimulation) teach, manifest, open, and declare four times
every year (at the least) in their Sermons and other Collations and Lectures,
That all usurped and foreign power, (forasmuch as the same has no establishment
nor ground by the Law of God) is for most just causes taken away and abolished:
and that therefore no manner of obedience and subjection within his Majesty's
Realms and Dominions, is due unto any such foreign power: but that the Kings
power within his Realms of England, Scotland and Ireland, and other his
Dominions and Countries, IS THE HIGHEST POWER UNDER GOD, to whom all men as
well Inhabitants as born within the same, do by Gods Laws owe most loyalty and
obedience, before and above all other Powers and Potentates in the earth.

Canon II. Impug^ers of the Kings Supremacy censured.
Whosoever shall hereafter affirm, that the Kings Majesty has not the same
authority in causes Ecclesiastical, that the godly Kings had among the Jews,
and Christian Emperors in the primitive Church, or impeach in any part his
Regal Supremacy in the said causes restored to the Crown, and by the Laws of
this Realm therein established, let him be excommunicated ipso facto, and not
restored but only by the Archbishop after his repentance and public revocation
of those his wicked errors.

Canon XXXVI. Subscription required of all such who are to be made Ministers.
No person shall hereafter be received into the Ministry, ^or either by
Institution or Collation admitted to any Ecclesiastical living, nor suffered to
preach, to Chatechize, or to be a Lecturer, or Reader of Divinity in either
Univerfities, or in any Cathedral or Collegiate Church, City, or Market Town,
Parish Church, Chapel, or in any other place within this Realm, except he be
licenced by the Archbishop, or by the Bishop of the Diocese, (where he is to
be placed) under their Hands and Seal, or by one of the two Universities under
their Seal likewise, and except he shall first subscribe to these three
Articles following, in such manner and sort as we have here appointed.

1. That the Kings Majesty under GOD, is the only supreme Governor of this
Realm, and of all other his Highness Dominions and Countries, as well in all
Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or causes, as Temporal: and that no foreign
Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, have or ought to have
Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Preeminence, or Authority Ecclesiastical or
Spiritual, within his Majesty's said Realms, Dominions and Countries, etc.

And Can. 55. They prescribed this form of prayer to be used by them in their
prayers before all their SerLectures, and Homilies.

And herein I require you, most especially to pray for the Kings most excellent
Majesty our Sovereign Lord CHARLES, King of England, Scotland, France and
Ireland, Defendor of the Faith, and Supreme Governor in these his Realms, and
all other his Dominions and Countries, over all persons, in all causes, as well
Ecclesiastical as Temporal. Ye shall also pray for the Kings most honorable
Council, and for all the Nobility and Magistrates of this Realm, that all and
every of these in their several callings, may serve truly and painfully to the
glory of GOD, and the edifying and well governing of his people, remembering the
account that they must make. Also ye shall pray for the whole Commons of this
Realm, that they may live in true Faith and Fear of God, in humble obedience to
the King, and brotherly charity one to another. Which all Ministers and
Preachers duly observed; usually adding this clause thereunto; That God out of
his infinite mercy, would grant so to bless the Kings Majesty, and his Royal
issue with a perpetual Posterity, that there might never want a Man of that
Royal race to sway the Scepter of these Realms, so long as the Sun and Moon
should ^ndure, and till all Scepters and Kingdoms should be resigned at the
last day into the hands of Jesus Christ, the King of Kings.

The Lords Spiritual, Temporal and Commons of the Anno 1603.
Realm of England, assembled in Parliament, in the first year of King James, do
thus express and declare their own and the whole Kingdoms unspeakeable joys,
acclamations and thanksgivings unto God, and their own and their posterities
Signal Loyalty, affection, and Devotion to King James, his Heirs and Royal
progeny for ever, in the Statute of 1 Jacobi chapter 1. entitled, A most joyful
and just Recognition, of the immediate, lawful, and undoubted succession,
descent and Right of the Crown^

Great and manifold were the benefits (most dread and most gracious Sovereign)
wherewith almighty God blessed this Kingdom and Nation, by the happy union and
conjunction of the two Nobles houses of York and Lancaster, thereby preserving
this noble Realm, formerly torn and almost wasted with long and miserable
dissension and bloody Civil War. But more inestimable and unspeakable
blessings are thereby powered upon us, because there i^ derived and grown from
and out of that union of those two Princely families, a more famous and greater
^nion, (or rather a re-uniting) of two Mighty, Famous, and ancient Kingdoms,
(yet anciently but one) of England and Scotland, under one Imperial Crown, in
your most Royal Person, who is lineally, rightfully, and lawfully descended of
the body of the most excellent Lady Margaret, eldest daughter of the most
renowned King Henry the 7th. and the high and noble Princess Queen Elizabeth
his wife, eldest daughter of King Edward the 4th. The said Lady Margaret being
eldest sister of King Henry the 8th. father of the high and mighty Princess
offamous memory, Elizabeth late Queen of England.

In confideration whereof, albeit we your Majesty's l^yal and faithful
Subjects of all Estates and Degrees, with all possible public Joy and
Acclamation, by open Proclamations within few hours after the decease of our
late Sovereign Queen, acknowledging thereby, with one full voice of tongue and
heart, that your Majesty was our only, lawful and rightful Liege Lord and
Sovereign, and by our unspeakable and general rejoicing, and applause at your
Majesty's most happy inauguration, and Coronation: by the affectionate desire
of infinite numbers of us of all degrees, to see your Royal Person, and by all
possible outward means, have endeavored to make demonstration of our inward
love, zeal, and devotion to your most excellent Maj^stie, our undoubted
rightful Liege Sovereign Lord and King: yet, as we cannot do it too often or
enough, so can there be no means or way, so fit both to sacrifice our unfeined
and hearty thanks to Almighty God, for blessing us with a Sovereign, ador^ed
with the rarest gifts of mind and body, in such admirable peace and quietness,
and upon the knees of our hearts to agnize our most constant faith, obedience,
and loyalty to your Majesty, and your Royal Progeny, as in this high Court of
Parliament, where all the whole body of the Realm, and every particular Member
thereof, either in Person or Representation (upon their own free Elections) are
by the Laws of this Realm, deemed to be personally present.

To the present acknowledgment whereof to your Majesty, we are the more deeply
bounden and obliged, as well in regard of the extraordinary care and pains,
which with so great wisdom, knowledge, experience, and dexterity, your
Majesty (since the Imperial Crown of this Realm descended to you) have taken
for the continuance and establishment of the blessed peace both of the Church
of England in the true and fincere Religion, and of the Commonwealth, by due
and speedy administration of justice, as in respect of the gracious care and
inward affection, which it pleased you on the first day of this Parliament so
lively to express by your own words, so full of high wisdom, learning, and
virtue, and so repleate with Royal and thankful acceptance of all our
faithful and constant endeavors, which is, and ever will be to our
inestimable consolation and comfort.

We therefore your most humble and loyal Subjects, the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, do from the
bottom of our hearts, yield to the divine Majesty, all humble thanks and
praises, not only for the said unspeakable, and inestimable benefits, and
blessings above mentioned, but also that he has further enriched your
Highness with a most Royal Progeny, of Most rare, and excellent gifts and
forwardness, and in his goodness is like to increase the happy number of
them. And in most humble and lowly manner, do beseech your most Excellent
Majesty, that (as a memorial to all posterities, amongst Nota.
the Records of your high Court of Parliament for ever to endure, of our
Loyalty, Obedience, and hearty and humble Affection) it may be published and
declared in this high Court of Parliament, and enacted by authority of the
same, That we (being bounden thereunto, both by the Laws of God and Man) do
recognize and acknowledge, (and thereby express our unspeakable Joys) That
immediately upon the dissolution and decease of Elizabeth late Queen of
England, the Imperial Crown of the Realm of England, and of all the Kingdoms,
Dominions, and Rights belongiug to the same, did by inherent Birthright, and
lawful and undoubted Successien, descend and come to your most Excellent
M^jestie, as being Lineally, Justly and Lawfully, next and sole Heir of the
Blood Royal of this Realm, as is aforesaid. And that by the goodness of God
Almighty, and lawful Right of descent, under one Imperial Crown, your Majesty
is of the Realms and Kingdoms of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, the
most Potent, and migh^y King, and by Gods goodness, more able to protect, and
govern us your loving Subjects, in all Peace and Plenty, than any of your
noble Progenitors. And thereunto we most humbly, and faithfully do submit, and
Nota.
oblige our selves, our heirs and posterities for ever, until the last drop of
our Bloods be spent And do beseech your Majesty to accept the same, as the
first fruits in this high Court of Parliament, of our Loyalty and faith to your
Majesty and your Royal Progeny, and posterity for ever. Which if your
Majesty shall be pleased (as an argument of your gracious acceptance) to
adorn with your Majesty's Royal Assent, (without which, it can neither be
complete and perfect, nor remain to all posterity according to our most humble
desire, as a memorial of your Princely and tender affection toward us) we
shall add this also to the rest of your Majesty's unspeakable and inestimable
benefits.

In which Act there are these particulars, very seasonable and observable, in
respect of the present posture of our public affairs.

1. That the happy union and conjunction of our divided Kingdoms, formenly torn
and wasted, with long and miserable dissentions and bloody civil wars, between
Competitors for the Crown, and the King and Subjects, is a great and
unspeakable benefit and blessing to the Kingdom and Nation, bestowed on them by
God himself.

2. That the re-uniting not only of the two, but three mighty, famous and
ancient Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, under one Imperial Crown,
and Heredirary King, is a far more inestimable and unspeakable blessing to all
3. Kingdoms and Nations.

3. That there is no Interregnum in Law in the Realm and Crown of England, but
that immediately upon the decease of the King thereof; the Imperial Crown of
the Realm of England, and of all the Kingdoms, Dominions, and Rights belonging
to the same, do by inherent bi^thright, and lawful and undoubted Succession,
Lineally, Justly, and lawfully descend to the next heir of the blood Royal,
before he be publicly crowned King. As this Act in direct Terms declares, and
( Cooks 7. Rep. Calvin's Case ^. 10, 11. 3 Instit. p. 7.
) all the Judges of England, unanimously adjudged in the case of Watson, and
Cleark, 2. Popish Priests, (who held King James no lawful King, before he was
Crowned, and thereupon conspired ^rook Treason 29. Graftons Cronicle p. 1326,
etc. ^ox Acts and Monuments, vol. 3. Holinshed, and Speed, 1. Mariae. My Plea
for the Lords, p. 494, 10 499.
to imprison him in the Tower, etc. for which they were both condemned and
executed as Traitors) Hill. 1. Jacobi; as had been often adjudged before in the
first 7. years of King H. 6. and in the cases of Queen Jane, the Dukes of
Northumberland and Suffolk, the Lord Rochford, Sir John Gates, Sir, Thomas
Palmer and others, condemned, in levying War against her, and executed 1
Mariae, for Treason against Qu. Mary, before she was Crowned, to deprive her of
the Crown; which both the Peers and Judges of the Realm, and the Parliament of
1 Mariae, chapter 16. adjudged Treason within 25 E. 3. against the mistaken
Doctrine of Mr. Thomas Scot, and some temporizing Lawyers of late years.

4. That it is the duty and practice of all loyal and saithfull Subjects, of
all estates and degrees, with all po^sible public joys, unspeakable general
rejoycings, acclamations, applauses, affectionate desires, and by other means
to proclaim, acknowledge and Crown their lawful hereditary Kings, after the
decease of their Ancestors, and to make all possible demonstrations of their
cordial loyalty, love, zeal and affection to them both in and out of Parliment,
being obliged thereunto both by the Laws of God and Man.

5. That this Act of Parliament, and the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, do
both in point of Law, Loyalty, Justice, Conscience, oblige the whole English
Nation, their heirs and posterities for ever, to be true, faithful, loyal and
obedient to King James, his heirs and poste^itie for ever, (and so to our
present King) till the last drop of their blood be spent, as to their
undoubted, lawful, and hereditary Kings and Sovereigns.

6. That a numerous hopeful royal Progeny, likely to continue and perpetuate
the hereditarie succession of the Crown in the true Regal line, is an
extraordinary blessing and happiness to the Kingdom, for which they are all
bound both in and out of Parliament, to render all humble thanks and praises
unto God.

To this I shall subjoyn the Statute of 3 Iaco^i, chapter 1. entitled,

An Act for a public Thanksgiving to Almighty God every year, on the fifth day
of November.
FOrasmuch as Almighty God has in all ages showed his power and mercy, in the
miraculous and gracious deliverance of his Church, and in the protection of
religious Kings and States: And that no Nation of the earth has been blessed
with greater benefits than this Kingdom now enjoys, having the true and free
profession of the Gospel under our most gracious Sovereign Lord King James, the
most great, learned and religious King that ever reigned therein, enriched with
a most hopeful and plentiful Progeny, proceeding out of his Royal loins,
promising continuance of this happiness and profession to all posterity: the
which many malignant and devilish Papists, Jesuits and Seminary Priests much
envying and fearing, Conspired most horribly, when the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, the Queen, the Prince, and all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
Commons should have been assembled in the Upper House of Parliament upon the
fifth day of November in the year of our Lord 1605. suddenly to have blown up
the said whole House with Gunpowder; An invention so inhuman, barbarous and
cruel, as the like was never before heard of, and was (as some of the principal
Conspirators thereof confess) purposely devised and con^luded to be done in
the said House, that where the sundry necessary and Religious Laws for
preservation of the Church and State were made, which they falsely and
slanderously term cruel Laws: enacted against them and their Religion, both
place and persons should be all destroyed and blown up at once, which would
have turned to the utter ruin of this whole Kingdom, had it not pleased
Almighty God, by inspiring the Kings most Excellent Majesty with a Divine
spirit, to interpret some dark ph^ses of a Letter showed to his Majesty, above
and beyond all ordinary construction, thereby miraculously discovering this
hidden Treason not many hours before the appointed time for the execution
thereof: Therefore the Kings most Excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and all his Majesty's FaithfuIl and loving Subjects, do most justly
acknowledge this great and infinite Blessing to have proceeded merely from God
his Great Mercy. and to his most holy Name do ascribe all the Honor, (...) and
Praise. And to the end this unfeigned Thankfulness may never be forgotten, but
be had in perpetual Remembrance, that all Ages to come may yield praise to his
Divine Majesty for the same, and have in memory THIS JOYFUL DAY OF
DELIVERANCE.

Be it therefore enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled,
and by the Authority of the same, That all and singular Ministers in every
Cathedral and Parish Church, or other usual place of Common prayer within this
Realm of E^gland, and the Dominions of the same, shall always upon the fifth
day of November, say Morning Prayer, and give unto Almighty God thanks for this
most happy Deliverance. And that all and every person and persons inhabiting
within this Realm of England, and the Dominions of the same, shall always upon
that day diligently and faithfully resort to the Parish Church or Chapel
accustomed, or to some usual Church or Chapel where the said Morning prayer,
preaching, or other service of God shall be used, and then and there to abide
orderly and soberlie during the time of the said prayers, preaching, or other
service of God there to be used and ministered.

And because all and every person may be put in mind of this Duty, and be the
better prepared to the said ^oly service, Be it enacted by Authority
aforesaid, That every Minister shall give warning to his Parishioners
publikelie in the Church at morning prayer, the Sunday before every such fifth
day of November, for the due observation of the said day. And that after
morning Prayer or preaching upon the said fifth day of November, they read
publicly, distinctlie, and plainly this present Act.

Upon this occasion there was a special Book of Prayers and Thanksgivings,
complied by the Bishops and Clergy, prescribed by Authority to be annually read
in all Churches and Chapels, on the 5th. of November, wherein (amongst others)
there were four remarkable prayers and thanksgivings relating to the King,
Queen, Prince, all the Royal posterity, Nobility, and Magistrates, which I
shall here insert.

I.
ALmighty God, who have in all Ages showed thy power and mercy, in the
miraculous and gracious deliverances of thy Church, and in the protection of
righteous and religious Kings, and States, professing thy Holy and Eternal
Truth, against the wicked conspi^acies, and malicious practices of all the
enemies thereof: We yield unto thee from the very ground of our hearts all
po^le praise and thanks for the wonderful, and mighty Deliverance of our
gracious Sovaraign King L^mes, the Queen, the Prince, and all the Royal
branches, with the Nobility, Clergy, and Commons of this Realm assembled
together in Parliament, by ^opish treachery appointed as sheep to the
slaughter, and that in most barbarous and savage manner, no age yielding
example of the like cruelty intended toward the Lords anointed, and his
people. Can this thy goodness O Lord, be forgotten worthy to be written in a
pillar of Marble, that we may ever remember to praise thee for the same, as the
fact is worthy a lasting monument, that all posterity may learn to detest it?
From this unnatural conspiracy, not our merit, but thy mercy, not our
foresight, but thy providence has delivered us, not our love to thee, but thy
love to thy anointed servant, and thy poor Church, with whom thou have promised
to be present to the end of the world. And therefore not unto us, not unto us,
Lord, but to thy Name be ascribed all honor and glory in all Churches of the
Saints, throughout all generations: for thou Lord have discovered the sn^s of
death, thou have broken them, and we are delivere d; be thou still our mighty
Protector, and scatter our cruel Enemies, which delight in blood: infatuate
their Counsel, and root out their Babylonish and Antichristian sect, which say
of Jerusalem, down with it, even to the ground. And to that end strengthen the
hands of our gracious King, the Nobles and Magistrates of the Land with
Judgment and Justice, to cut off ^hese Workers of Iniquity, (whose Religion is
Rebellion, whose Faith is Faction, whose Practice is murdering of Souls and
Bodies) and to root them out of the confines and limits of this Kingdom, that
they may never prevail against us, and triumph in the ruin of thy Chu^h: and
give us grace by true and serious repen^ance, to avert these and the like
Judgments from us. This Lord we earnestly crave at thy merciful hands,
togethe^ with the countenance of thy powerful protection over our bread
Sovereign, the whole Church, and these Realms, and the speedy confusion of our
implacable Enemies, and that for thy dear Sons sake, our only mediator and
advocate.

II.
ALmighty God and heavenly Father, which of thy everlasting providence and
tender mercy toward us, have prevented the extreme malice and mischievous
imagination of our ensmies, revealing and con^nding their horrible and devilish
enterprise plotted against our Sovereign Lord the King, his Royal House, and
the whole S^ate of this Realm, for the subversion thereof, together with the
truth of thy Gospel and pure Religion amongst us, and for the reducing of
Popish Superstition and tyranny into this Church and land: we most humbly
praise and magnify thy glorious name, for thine infinite gracious goodness in
this our mavelous Deliverance; we confess it was and is thy mercy, thy mercy
alone, (most merciful Father) that we are not cons^med, that their snare is
broken, and our Soul is escaped. For our sins cried to Heaven against us, and
our iniquities justly called for judgment upon us: but thy great mercy toward
us has exalted it self above judgment, not to deal with us after our sins, to
give us over (as we deserved) to be a prey to our enemies, but taking our
correction into thine own hands, to deliver us from their blood-thirsty malice,
and preserve from death and destruction our King and Stat^, with thy Gospel and
true Religion amongst us: Good Lord give us true repent^nce, and unfeigned
conversion unto thee, to prevent further judgments: increase us more and more
in lively Faith and fruitful love in all obedience, that thou may continue
thy loving favor with the light of thy Gospol, to us and our Posterity for
evermore. Make us now and always truly thankful in heart, word and deed, for
all thy gracious mercies, and this our special deliverance. Protect and defend
our Sovereign Lord the King, with the Queen and all the Royal Progeny, from all
treasons and conspiracies, preserve them in thy faith, fear and love, under the
shadow of thy wings against all evil and wickedness, prosper their reign with
long happiness on earth, and everlasting glory following in the Kingdom of
Heaven. Bless the whole State and Realm with grace and peace, that with one
heart and mouth we may praise thee in thy Church, and always sing joyfully,
that thy merciful kindness is ever more and more toward us, and the truth of
the Lord endures for ever, through Jesus Christ o^r only Savior and Redeemer,
Amen.

III.
ETernal God, and our most mighty Protector, we thy people of this Land,
confess our selves, above all the Nations of the earth, infinitely bound unto
thy heavenly Majesty for thy many unspeakable benefits conferred and hea^ed
upon us, especially for planting thy Gospel among us, and placing over us a
most gracious King, a faithful Professor and Defendor of the same; both which
exasperate the enemies of true Religion, and enrage their thoughts to the
invention of most dreadful designs: all which notwithstanding it has pleased
thee bitherto, either to prevent or overthrow: at this time principally thou
have most strangely discovered an horrible and cruel plot and device, for the
massacring as well of thy d^ar Servant and our dread Sovereign, as of the chief
States assembled in thy fear, for the continuance of thy truth and good of this
Realm. We humbly present ourselves at thy feet, admiring thy might and wisdom,
and acknowledging thy grace and favor, in preserving them and the whole Realm
by their safety: beseeching thee for thy Son Jesus Christ his sake to continue
still thy care over us, and to shield our gracious King under the shadow of thy
wings, that no mischievous attempt may come near, nor the Sons of wickedness
may hurt him, but that under him we may still enjoy this his peaceable
Government, with the profession of the Gospel of thy Son Jesus Christ, to whom
with thee and the holy Ghost, etc.

IV.
O God, infinite in power and of endless mercy, we give thee all possible
thanks, since it has pleased thee so miraculously to discover, and defeat the
mischievous plots of thine and our Enemies: thou have delivered our dread
Sovereign from the snares of the Fowler, and his Nobles from the fire of the
fury of the wicked: he shall rejoice in thy Salvation, and we his People shall
triumph in this thy wonderful Deliverance, thy Gospel shall prosper, and thine
Adversaries shall be confounded. And multiply (good Lord) we beseech thee, thy
great goodness toward our gracious King, and his Kingdoms, from this time
forth, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

After this Deliverance from this horrid Powder Plot, See Devotio^s of the
ancient Church, etc printed 1^60.
there were these 2. forms of Prayers used in the Commons House by the Speak^rs
during the Parliaments session, very seasonable for our times, wherein they
expressed their Loyalty and Devotion to the King and his Royal Progeny.

A Prayer used by the Speaker of the Commons House of Parliament.
I.
O GOD, most great and glorious, which dwell in the Heavens over all, yet
humblest thy self to behold the things that are done upon the earth: we, the
people and sheep of thy pasture, assembled by thy providence, to the
performance of this high service, whereupon the honor of thy name, the beauty
of thy Church amongst us, the glory of the King, and wealth of our State does
depend, knowing, that without thee, we can do nothing: do, at this time, with
fear and reverence, in the beginning of our consultations, first look up unto
thee (from whom wisdom and happy success does come) praying thee to look
down upon us, who first look up unto thee (from whom wisdom and happy success
does come) praying thee, to look down from Heaven upon us with the eye of thy
mercy; to draw near unto us with the presence of thy grace: to prepare us all
with counsel and understanding; and to be President, and Director of all our
conferences: that those things may be propounded, conceived, allowed, and
confirmed, which may best please thee, and most directly and soundly uphold
the honor of thy Name, the ^nceritie of thy worship; the safety of our King;
and peace of thy people: even for thy Son our Lords sake.

And that we may not our selves, be any hinderance to the obtaining of these
our defires, either by means of any sin formerly committed, or of any
corruption yet remaining in us: we humbly pray thee, to forgive our sins, and
blot out all our iniquities: and to stand reconciled unto us, in an everlasting
covenant of peace, as if we had never sinned against thee.

And, because our hearts by nature are not fit for good cogitations; create a
new heart, and renew a right spirit in us: remove far from us all vainglorious
humor of advancing our private profit, all envious humor of disgracing other
men's gifts, all malicious humor of hurting any man's person: and (finally) all
froward humor of opposing our selves, against just, needful, and godly
things, by whomsoever propounded. Furnish us with knowledge, wisdom, and zeal,
by sending down thy spirit into our hearts, that we may understand, discern,
prefer, and set forward all things tending to the advancement of thy glory,
and such as may be thought worthy our assent and furtherance.

And, because all good things are not of equal goodness, nor all needful
things of equal necessity: let our care and zeal be equally proportioned to
the degrees of things in g^nesse and necessity different. And therefore,
first, make us careful of the glory of thy Name (which is the high end of all
thy counsels and works, and ought to be the last, and first respect of all our
purposes and doing^) And therein, let our especial care be, to provide for the
continuance of thy word, and religious practice of thy worship by the Ministry
and means that Christ has planted in his Church: next, let the good of this
whole Island move our care and zeal; which consisting in the safety and honor
of the King, and the enacting and executing of good Laws; let us be wisely
careful, and faithfully zealous for the Person of our King, whom thou the King
of Kings have in mercy set over us.

And because no Law can be good, that is not agreeable to thy Law, which
contains the Fundamental equity of all Laws: in making Laws to govern thy
people, let us always have an eye unto thy Law, not digressing from the holy
equity thereof: and what through thy mercy, we shall here profitably enact, we
pray thee, through the whole Kingdom it may be truly executed, that our great
labor may not be disgraced with little fruit.

And forasmuch as we all and every one of us have, in this place, with wonder
and astonishment, and without any merit of ours, found a most evident assurance
of thy mercy and goodness, in a miraculous deliverance from the greatest
danger, by Popish treachery tha^ ever was attempted or threatened, toward our
King, our State and Us: give us (good Lord) hearts above the hearts of men, to
offer unto thee in the same place, a daily sacrifice of thanksgiving in the
highest measure; together with a fervent and incessant zeal, care, and
diligence in all our proceedings, for the settling of the peace and happy estate
of thy Church amongst us: the preservation of our King; his royal Progeny; our
selves, and our Posterity: and for the preventing, suppressing, and final
rooting out of the spring, issue, and fruit of all such hellish and popish
hearts, intentions, and practices: to the everlasting praise and glory of thy
blessed name.

Hear us, we pray thee (O Father of mercy) in these our most humble and
needful petitions: forgive and answer us, according to thy fatherly and great
goodness, for Jesus Christ his sake, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost,
three Persons, and one God, be all praise, glory, and power, now, and forever,

Amen.
A Prayer for the Parliament, used also in the House
II.
ALmighty God, which by thy holy Prophet David art most truly said, to stand in
the Congregation of Princes, and give judgment in the midst of the mighty
men of the world, and through whom Princes do reign, Lawmakers do disce^n j^st
things, Lords bear rule, and all Judges of the earth execute judgment, and for
that comes of thee all Counsel and equity, all understanding and strength:
grant unto us here gathered together in thy name, that wisdom which is always
assistant to thy seat, to give knowledge to our feeble and ignorant minds Send
down (we beseech thee) the same wisdom out of thy holy heavens, and from the
throne of thy Majesty, that is may be now with us, and labor with us, whereby
we surely knowing what is acceptable unto thee, may be led through it to the
debating, weighing and final determining of those matters, by the which thy
blessed Name may be glorified, thy Catholic Church of England confirmed and
increased, the Kings assurance established, the common tranquillity of this
Realm safely maintained, and last of all, all estates and people thereof, in
true obedience and charity united and knit together. Grant this, O God, for thy
only Sons sake Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

In the Lords House, the Collects and Prayers in the Common Prayer Book and
Letany for the King, Queen, Prince, and Royal Posterity, with other prayers
were daily used by the Bishops, and Peers during their Session.

To mention all the particular Prayers for the King, Queen, and Royal
posterity, comprised in Books of private Prayers and Devotion (as the Practice
of Piety, and the like) and See Dr. John Whites defense of the way. Bishop
Bilson, Bishop Andrews Arch. Bish^p Abbor, Bishop Buckridge, Bishop Abbot,
Bish^ Davenant, Bishop Usher, Dr. Featly, etc. Anno 165.
Epistles Dedicatory, perfixed to hundreds of B^oks, and Sermons, dedicated to
King James, by Bishops, Ministers, and others of all sorts, and in usual Graces
before and after meals, would be both infinite, and nauseous, being commonly
known, and obvious to all, and therefore I shall wholly pretermit them, the
substance of them being comprised in those Prayers already mentioned.

I shall now proceed to the reign of our late King Charles; who as he had
constant Supplications and Prayers made for him in all Cathedral and Parish
Churches, Chapels, Colleges, most private families, and in our Parliaments
themselves, by name, during all King James his reign, as Duke of York and
Prince of Wales; so after his coming to the Crown March 27. 1625. till January
1648. he had the like public and private Prayers, Intercessions, and
Supplications, made for him throughout his 3. Realms, as King, and for his
Queen and royal Posterity, not only by our preaching Ministers, in their
prayers before their Sermons, and by most others in their morning and evening
family and closet prayers, and Graces before or after meals, as our own
experience attests, but likewise these special set Prayers, Petitions and
Collects in our Letany, and common Prayer Book, which I shall here transcribe,
because almost quite forgotten, by above 12. whole years discontinuance in most
Churches and Families too. In the public L^tany, ordered to be read thrice
every week, or oftener upon occasion, there are these several Prayers, and
Petitions to God,

That it would please thee to keep and strengthen in the true worshipping of
thee, in righteousness and holiness of life, thy servant Charles, our most
gracious King and Governor. That it may please thee to rule his heart in thy
faith, fear and love; and that he may evermore have affiance in thee, and ever
seek thy honor and glory. That it may please thee, to be his defender and
keeper, giving him the victory over all his Enemies. That it may please thee to
bless and preserve our gracious Queen Mary, Prince Charles, and the rest of
the Royal Issue. After every of which several Prayers, and Supplications, all
the People severally answered; We beseech thee to hear us good Lord. After
which followed these two Prayers, for the Kings M^jestie, the Queen, Prince and
Royal Issue, and read twice every day in most places.

O God our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
the only Ruler of Princes, which do from thy throne behold all the dwellers
upon earth, most heartily we beseech thee with thy favor to behold our most
Gracious Sovereign Lord King Charles; and so replenish him with the grace of
thy holy Spirit, that he may always incline to thy will, and walk in thy way;
endue him plentifully with heavenly gifts, Grant him in health and wealth Those
who Prayed thus cordially could not shorten his life by a violent death.
long to live, strengthen him that he may (...) and overcome all his Enemies;
and finally, after this life, he may attain everlasting joy and felicity,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

Almighty God, the Father of thine elect and of their seed (which Bishop Laud
changed into, the fountain of all goodness) we humbly beseech thee to bless
our gracious Queen Mary, Prince Charles, and the rest of the royal issue: Endue
them with thy holy Spirit, enrich them with thy Heavenly grace, prosper them
with all happiness, and bring them to thine everlasting Kingdom, through Jesus
Christ our Lord, Amen.

In the Prayer for the whole Estate of Christ's Church, there is this Clause,
relating to Kings in general, and King Charles in particular. We beseech thee
also to besee^h and defend all Christian Kings, Princes, and Governors, and
Specia^y thy servant Charles our King, that under him we may be godly, and
quietly Governed.

When these Prayers and Collects with the Book of Common Prayer, were
suspended, by the Directory of the public worship of God, in most places
throughout the 3. Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Printed by order
of both Houses, 13 Martii 1644. yet the substance of them was still continued
by the very Directory it self, during the heat of the late Wars, between the
King and Parliament: witness p. 10, 11. of public Prayer before the Sermon,
wherein all Ministers are directed, To pray for all in Authority, especially
for the Kings Majesty, that God would make him rich in blessings, both in
Person and Government, establish his Throne in Religion and righteousness,
save him from all evil Counsel, and make him a blessed and glorious Instrument
for the Conservation and Propagation of the Gospel, for the Encouragement and
Protection of those that do well, and the terror of all that do evil, and the
great good of the whole Church, and of all his Kingdoms, for the Conversion of
the Queen, the Religious education of the Prince, and the rest of the Royal
seed, for the comforting of the afflicted Queen of Bohemia, sister to our
Sovereign, and for the Restitution and Establishment of the Illustrious Prince
Charles, Elector Palatine, (much more then now of our Illustrious long-exiled
King CHARLES) to all his Dominious and Dignities.

To pretermit all Prayers made for King Charles, in Epistles perfixed to
hundreds of Books, of all sorts, dedicated to him whiles Prince of Wales, and
King of England, Scotland, and Ireland; I shall Conclude only with 3. short
Prayers of this Nature, in 3. of our learnedest late deceased Antiquaries
Dedicatory Epistles to his Majesty, being of 3. several professions.

The first is Mr. John Seldens, in the cloze of his Dedicatory Epistle to His
Mare clausum, Londini 1635. Inexuperabilem Tibi felicitatem, sanctissima illa
Majestas, quae Tuae archetypa est, praestet conservetque.

The 2. is Sir Henry Spelmans in the end of his Dedicatory Epistle before the
first Tome of his Councils, Londini 1639. Dei Vicario, Ecclesiae Nutricio,
Fidei Defensori Carolo, Dei gratia Magnae Britaniae, Franciae, and Hiberniae
Regi, etc. Magno, Pio, Augustissimo, Deus optimus maximus, Regi am vestram
Majestatem, sobolemque Sere^ssimum, Ecclesiae et Britaniis Imperpetuum sospitet
beatissime

The 3, is, most learned, renowned and pious Archbishop Ush^r, who thus winds
up his Epistle to King Charles, perfixed to his Britannicarum Ecclesiarum
Antiquitates, Dublini, 1639. Deus optimus maximus, Regum suorum custos et
vindex, vitam ^ibi det prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, exercitus
^rtes, Senatum fidelem, populum probum; Tertullian Apologet.
Veteris Ecclesiae pro Imperatoribus s^is vota haec solemnia, pro tua et tuorum
salute Redintegrat et toto animi affectu numini divino nuncupat, Serenissimae
Tuae Majestatis servus humilimus, Iacobus Armachanus.

The very next day after the most illegal Trial, Condemnation Feb. 1. 1648.
and bloody Execution of our late Sovereign Lord King Charles by that Prodigy
of Lawyers John Bradshaw, and his Assessors, in the new created High Court of
Injustice, against the ( See the Vind^ation of the secured and secluded
Members, and the History of Independency part 2.
) Votes and Protests of the Secluded Lords, and Secured Commons, one of the
then secured Members (out of his Loyalty to his Majesty, and his royal Heir and
Successor whose rights he strenuously asserted in his Speech in the House, for
which he was seized and imprisoned by the Army Dec. 6. 1648.) at his own charge
Printed, 350. of the ensuing ( See the 2d. part of the History of Independency
where it is likewise printed.
) Proclamations, which he caused to be sent to most Sheriffs and Mayors
throughout England and Wales, and some of them to be pasted up at Westminster,
and elsewhere in and about London, notwithstanding the Anti-Parliamentary, and
Antimonarchical Junctoes strict Proclamation to the contrary, under pain of
High Treasons and the most Capital Punishments; which deterred others both from
crowning and proclaiming their Hereditary Sovereign, according to their former
Oaths, Covenants, and printed Remonstrances.

A PROCLAMATION PROCLAIMING CHARLES Prince of Wales, King of Great Britain,
France and Ireland.


WE the Noblemen, Judges, Knights, Lawyers, Gentlemen, Freeholders,
Merchants, Merchants, Citizens, Yeomen. Seamen, and other freemen of England,
do, according to our Allegiance and Covenant, by these presents heartily,
joyfully and unanimously acknowledge and proclaim the Illustrious Charles
Prince of Wales, next heir of the Blood Royal to his Father King Charles (whose
late wicked and traiterous Murder we do from our souls abominate, and all
parties and consenters thereunto) to be by hereditary Birthright, and lawful
succession, rightful and undoubted King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,
and the Dominions thereunto belonging. And that we will faithfully, constantly
and sincerely, in our several places and callings, defend and maintain his
Royal Person, Crown and Dignity with our Estates, Lives, and last drop of our
Bloods, against all opposers thereof; whom we do hereby declare to be Traitors
and Enemies to his Majesty and his Kingdoms. In testimony whereof, we have
caused these to be published and proclaimed throughout all Counties and
Corporations of this Realm, the first day of February, in the first year of his
Majesty's Reign. God save KING CHARLES the Second.

This short ejaculatorie Prayer and Acclamation GOD SAVE THE KING, subjoyned to
this Proclamation, was not only used at the Corouations, tryumphs, and publiek
Receptions in Cities, Colleges, Villages, Corporations, of all our own, and
foreign Kings, as I have elsewhere touched; but constantly annexed at the end
all our Statutes at large, printed after every Session of Parliament from ^9
H. 7. till 1 Caroli, and at the close of all our Kings, and Queens p^blick (
See the proclamations printed during the Re^gn of King Henry 7. 8. Edw. 6.
Queen Mary and Elizabeth, King James and King Charles, The ancienter
proclamations are entered in the Dorse of the Clause Rolls in the Tower.
) Proclamations, yea ecchoed out by our Sheriffs, Heralds, Cryers, Officers,
who proclaimed them, and by the generality of the people present at such
Proclamations; And it was likewise constantly used by all Cryers of all
public Courts of Justice, Assizes, Sessions of the peace, Eyres and Gaol
Deliveries upon sundry occasions, yea by every Malefactor, acquitted or
admitted to his Clergy; who usually cried, GOD SAVE THE KING; neither could
our Kings enter into any ^itie, Town, Village, College, School, or House
within their Dominions, but their Ears were filled with the joyful sound of
this Prayer and Loyal Acclamation. Which custom I trust will g^ into common
practice again, after its overlong Dis-continuance, through the treachery,
and Di^yalty of those who above all others had most obliged themselves to
continue it, by their respective old oftreiterated Oaths of Fealty, Homage,
Supremacy, Allegiance, Justices, Majors, Recorders, Sergeants at Law, Freemen;
and their new Protestations, Solemn National League and Covenant, Commissions,
Trusts, Offices, Callings; obliging them both in point of Conscience and Duty
to bear Faith and true Allegiance to the Kings Majesty, his Heirs and lawful
Successors, and to maintain and defend his and their Persons, Crowns, and all
Jurisdictions Rights, Privileges, and Royal Prerogatives, united, annexed and
belonging to the Imperial Crown of their Realms, against all Powers, Persons,
Invasions, Plots and Conspiracies whatsoever, without any Apostasy, defection
or detestable Neutrality. Which I hope they will now at last remember so far as
to expia^e all former violations of them, by their future fincere, cordial,
constant, inviolable Observations, by their daily public and private fervent
Prayers, Supplications, Intercessions, Thanksgivings, to God for his Majesty's
restitution, long life, and prosperous Reign; and by ecchoing out this usual
Acclamation upon all occasions, according to its pristine frequent use
throughout our Realms and Dominions.

I have thus at large by Histories, Records and Presidents of all times and
sorts, (to which sundry more might be accumulated) irrefragably evidenced the
constant un-interrupted practical loyalty of our Christian Predecessors, in
making public and private Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions and
Thanksgivings for our Christian Kings in this Island, whether of the British,
Saxon, English, Danish, Norman, or Scottish Race, and for their Queens, their
Royal Posterity, and Kingdoms, in their public and private Devotions, and in
their Epistles, Addresses, and Dedications to them; to the inrent they may now
at last excite, encourage, provoke, and inflame our degenerated disloyal,
undutifull, Men-fearing, Time-serving Generation conscienciously to revive, and
cons^antlie to practice this long neglected Christian Duty, as being the
principal means prescribed by God himself, and pursued by his Saints i^ all
Ages, to produce that public peace, unity, pro peritie and settlement which
we have all so long expected and longed for, but could never yet obtain by ani^
carnal policies, fastings, humiliations, prayers, since we gave over this
enjoined Duty, and can never probably hope for, much less actually enjoy, till
we return to the cordial un-interrupted performance thereof, and to our
pristine Allegiance, Loyalty, Obedience and Subjection to our undoubted
hereditary Sovereign Lord and King, according to our multiplied Oaths,
Protestations, C^venant, the Laws both of God and the Land, the only rules of
our Consciences and Practices, both as Christians and Subjects. And if all
these with the precedent and subsequent Presidents, Scriptures, Examples,
Authorities, our own present Pressures, Dissentions, Confus^ons, decay of
Trade, hopes of settlement, peace and prosperity, will not persuade our whole
^. Kingdoms to this their bounden Duty, that black Character which the Apostle
gives to the obstinate hard-hearted Jews, upon whom wrath was come to the
uttermost, will be ours too, 1 These. 2. 15. who both killed the Lord Jesus
Christ (their KING) and their own Prophets, and have persecuted us, and they
please not God, and are contrary to all men. -- * Pudet haec opprobria Nobis,
Et dici potuisse, and non potuisse refelli. Ovid.

CHAP. VII.
I Have heretofore (in the 4th. Chapter) presented you with sundry Presidents
of the Primitive Christains sigual Loyalty and Piety to their very
persecuting Heathen Emperors, in making fervent public and private Prayers,
Supplications and Intercessions unto God for their long life, health and
prosperity. To which I shall add two Presidents more.

The first out of the Annals of Eutychius Patriarch of Alexandria Anno 180.
(translated out of Arabic into Latin by learned Mr. Po^ock) printed Oxoniae
1656. who relates this of the Christians under( Eutychii Annals, p. 360.
) Marcus Antonius Severus, (a great Persecutor of them) Magnae hic calamitatis
and tristitiae diuturnae Christianis author fuit, multis sub illo Martyrium
passis. Ejus tempore magna fuit fames, siccitasque and pestis, dum per biennium
non plueret, adeo ut parum abesset, quin Rex and populus Imperio ipsius subdi^s
fame and peste perirent; Qui ergo Christianos rogar^nt, ut Precibus a Domino
suo pluviam impetrarent: See part 1. P. 50, 51.
illis igitur Preces ad Dominum nostrum fundentibus magnam pluviae copiam
demisit, quo pacto sublata est et fames, et pestis, both from this persecuting
Emperor and his Subjects.

The second is the memorable story of the Emperor Anno 304.
Maximinianus, who was smitten by God with several Diseases b Eutychii Annal.

for persecuting the Christians, so that his flesh did rot away, and worms
crept out of his Bowels, and he lay prostrate on the earth, stinking in such
sort that no man could come nigh unto him; All his Companions admiring, and his
very Enemies pitying him for what had thus befallen him. Whereupon Ipse vero ad
se reversus; Hoc forsan quod patior ( inquit) inde mihi accidit, quod
Christianos interfecerim. Liter as ergo ad omnes provincias suas dedit, ut
Christianos quicunque in carceribus essent, dimitterent, eosque honor
afficerent, nec ullum (...) damnum inserrent; Rogarent autem ut inter precandum
pro Imperatore vota ^underent; orantibus ergo pro Imperatore Christianis ac
preces fundentibus, Deus ipsi sanitatem restituit, adeo ^t viribus et sanitate
melius quam antca gauderet, as Eutichyus: or, ( Nicephorus ^cl Hist. l. 7. e.
22, 23.
Addit (...) a mandatum, ut statas solitasque pro Imperatore pre^s ad Deum
funderemus: Christianos Christiana sua templa exaedifieare, rem maturare,

supplicare pro nostra, pro Reipublicae, pro sua ipsorum salute, ut quovi^ modo
cum public^s rerum stotus integer and incolumis retineatur, tum ipsi in suis
familiis absque c^ra and sollicitud^e vitam traducere queant, as Eusebius and
Nicepborus, record the story. Lo here this persecuting bloody Pagan Emperor
restored to his perfect health, by the Prayers of the Christians whom he slew,
imprisoned, persecuted in his health; yet behold his desperate ingratitude both
to God and them. Ille vero ubi sanitati restitutus convaluisset, ad majorem
impietatis gradum quam antea prolapsus, in omnes ditiones su^ scribens,
Christianos occidi jussit, and ne professionis ejus quispiam in Imperio ejus
relinqueretur, neve urbem aut oppidum incolere sinerentur, sed penitus
extirparentur. Interfecti sunt ergo e Christianis, qua viri, qua feminae, qua
pueri, plures quam numer ari possint, adeo vt prae occisorum multitudine
Plaustris delati in mari, and in deserto projicerentur. But God soon after
smote him with an ulcer in his Bowels, which tortured him extremely, corroded
and eat out his Bowels, caused his very eyes to fall out of his head upon the
ground, burnt up his Flesh which was severed from his bones, so as he perished
by a most miserable death, confessing that God had deservedly punished him in
this sort, for his madness and rashness against Christ and his Members.

having conquered this Tyrant M^ximinianus in the field, he and the Christians
sang praises unto God for his great victory, in the words of Moses and the
Israelites after Pharaoh his overthrow, Exodus 15. 1, to 22. After which
entering into Rome in triumph with great pomp, he was there received by all the
people, both men, women and children, Senators and other Noble persons running
out by Troops to meet him with joyful countenances, willing minds, happy
acclamations, and unsatiable joy, as their Deliverer, the Conservatour of their
Country, and most benign Patron. But he as one having the fear of God
naturally residing in his mind, not p^ed up with these triumphant acclamations
and popular applauses, nor yet with the Proclamation of his praises, yet very
conscious of the aid given him from God, commanded immediately, that the
Banner of our Saviors passion should be ^et in the hand of his statue. Which
being set up in the most famous place in Rome, holding the sign of the Cross
in his right hand, he commanded this following Inscription to be engraven
thereon in Roman Letters; In this wholesome sign, the true cognizance of
Fortitude, I have delivered the City from under the Tyrants yoke, and set the
Senate and People of Rome at liberty, and restored them unto their pristine
Greatness and Splendour.

After ( Eusebius Ecel Hist. l. 9. c. 9. Niceph. (...). c. 39.
) Maximinianus the Tyrants death, an utter Enemy to all Piety and Godliness,
through the Grace of Almighty God Churches were re-edified, and erected from
^he Foundations, the Gospel of Jesus Christ freely preached, professed and
propagated; Maximinianus by public Edicts, proclaimed the chiefest and most
deadly Enemy, the most impious, wicked, pernicious and malicious Tyrant, and
most execrable hater of God. All Tables and Inscriptions set up in every City
to his and his Childrens honor, were either thrown down from aloft to the
ground, or obliterated, or blotted out with a deformed and black color: In
like manner all Statues erected to his honor being tumbled down, were broken
in piece^, and exposed to the laughter and derision of such who would abuse
them. All his persecuting Instruments, Favorers and Partisans, were in like
manner disgraced, disofficed, and some of them slain. The Christian Bishops,
Ministers, and Prosessors of the Gospel, made and sang special Songs of Praise
and Thanksgiving unto God Almighty, the King and Governor of all things, and
to Jesus Christ his Son, the Redeemer of their Souls, and Author of their
internal and external peace, enjoyed under their Christian Emperor; whose
Praises they extolled, as you may read at large in Eusebius, Ecles. Hist. 1.

set form of Prayer to God for himself and his Sons, to be said every day, or
Lords Day at least; recited in the ( Here p. 4.
) former Chapter. This first Christian Emperor, in the first General Eusebius. de

by him from all parts (whereof 3. came from our Isle of Anno 325.
( Bishop Usher de Eccles. Brit. Primordiis, P. 195.
) Britain) with a grave exhortation, to pres^rve mutual concord; added this
request to them in the close thereof, Ut pro ipso ad Deum preces obnixe
funderent, That they would earnestly power forth Prayers for him unto God. ( De
vita Constant. l. 4. c. 14.
) Eusebius further records of him, That whereas he esteemed that the Prayers of
Pious men, were of great moment to him, and to the safety and preservation of
the whole Commonwealth, toward which seeing he reputed them necessary, he did
not only upon all occasions throw himself down as a Supplicant unto God, Uerum
etiam ut pro se ab Ecclesiae Praesidibus supplicaretur, mandabit, but likewise
commanded that Supplications should be made for him by the Rectors of the
Church; which they accordingly performed.

In the 30th. year of his reign, ( ^useb De vi^a Constant. l 4 c. 43.
) when a certain Priest Anno 336.
praised him to his face, as worthy to enjoy the chief Power of all things in
this life, and to reign together with the Son of God in the life to come; He
signifying his dislike thereof, exhorted him, not to use such flattering words
concerning him for time to come; but rather to contend for him with Prayers
from God, that he might seem worthy to be the servant of God both in this life,
and that which is to come. The same year this Emperor having assembled a very
great Synod of * Eusebius. Ibid. l. 4. c. 45.
Bishops and Priests to Jerusalem to the Dedication of the Temple he had there
built; some of them adorned that solemnity with Prayers and Disputations,
others with elegant Orations, Sermons and Interpretations of obscure places of
Scripture: others who could do none of these, Supplie^es Deopreces, etc.
Offered up humble Prayers and Supplications unto God for common peace, for the
Church of God, and for the Emperor himself, the Author of these most excellent
things, and for his Chi^dren who were dear to God.

In his ( Eusdbius de vita Constant. l. 4. c. 56.
) Expedition against the Persians, communicating his design unto the Bishops,
and desiring some of them to be always present with him who were most fit to
discharge the Duties of Piety, they readily promised to follow and not to
depart one step from him, but to go on warfare with him, Et apud Deum
supplicibus vovotis se pugnaturos, and that they would fight with God for him
against his Enemies with Supplications and Prayers: whereupon being greatly
delighted with this expression of their Wills and Endeavors, he caused a
magnificent Tabernacle to be made in form of a Church, in quo Deo victoriarum
datori ipse cum Episcopis supplicaret. Wherein he with his Bishops might make
Supplications to God the giver of Victories.

When he lay upon his Deathbed, his Centurions, and Anno 337.
Captains of the Army coming to his Chamber, deploring ^ Eusebius. de vita
Constant. l. 4. c. 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69.
his Condition, Longioremque et vitam optarent, and wishing him a longer life:
he answered them, He had now obtained true life, (after his Baptism) and that
he only understood of what felicity he was made partaker; and therefore he
would hasten and not procrastinate his migration unto God. Upon the tidings of
his death, all his Gards renting their Clothes, casting their Bodies upon the
Ground, and knocking their Heads against it, sending forth mournful Voices
with great sorrow and clamours, calling him their Lord, Prince, Emperor, and in
the interim bewayling him not as a Lord and Tyrant, but as pious and natural
Children do their Father. The Centurions and other Officers and Soldiers
predicated him their Savior, Keeper, Benefactor; the whole Army with all
reverence desired him as Flocks of Sheep their Shepherd; all the People
throughout every City running up and down manifested the secret wound and grief
of their minds by outcries and clamours, and the rest walked with dejected
Countenances as if they were astonished; every one reputing that this calamity
had principally happened to himself, and miserably afflicting themselves, as
bereaved of the common safety of human life. All the Dukes, Earls, and Assembly
of Princes, who were formerly accustomed to reverence and bow down unto him,
observing their pristine use and custom, going in at set times saluted the
Emperor lying in his Hearse, as if he were alive even after his death, bowing
themselves to the ground; the Senate, with all the rest of the Magistrates and
People doing the like reverence to him. Upon which Eusebius has this memorable
Observation, Solus vero iste beatus Imperator etiam mortuus regnavit, cum ei
soli post hominum memoriam, vel ipso Deo authore, omnes qui solebant, honores
tanquam superstiti tribuerentur. Nam ^um is solus ex omnibus Imperatoribus,
Regemomnium Deum and Christum ejus omnibus vitae actionibus, pie sancteque
col^erit, jure sane etiam hunc honor^m solus adeptus est, ut Dei voluntate,
quod in eo morte sepultum erat, tamen apud homines regnaret, ut ista scilicet
ratione nobis Deus significaret, animarum Regnum, his qui non prorsus
obduruerunt, nunqu^m consenescere, nunquam emori. His two Sons being absent
when he died, there were some select Captains out of the whole Army, eminent
for their Fidelity, sent to acquaint them with his death, the News whereof
being spread throughout all the Legions, they all with one mind and consent
presently resolved, as if great Constantine himself were alive, Neminem praeter
ejus Filios Romani Imperi^ Principem agnituros; and soon after all resolved,
that they should not only be called Caesar's, but likewise Augusti, which being
a Title of the greatest Dignity of all sorts, is the Proper note of the
greatest Empire. The Senate, People, and whole City of Rome exceedingly
lamented this Emperors death, did the same reverence to his Pictures, as to
himself whiles living; and painting the Effigies of Heaven in its proper
colors, pictured him above the Celestial Orbs, resting in the Heavenly
Assembly. At his Funeral the Soldiers, P^iests and People standing round about
his Hearse expressed their Affections and Devotions toward him in every kind
they could: ^ quibus Divinus per Preces cultus exhibitus est. Whose Praises
when they gloriously predicated; Jam populus frequens (...) cum Saverdotibus
non sine lachrymis, et sane magno cum gemitu, preces pro anima Imperatoris
fundebant (to wit, See Bishop Ushers Answer to the Jesuits Challenge: Sec^on
praying for the Dead.
that it might speedily be united to his body again at last by a most joyful
resurrection, not delivered out of purgatory) in quo and illi gratum atque
optatum pro Principe offici^m praestabant: and Deus ipse singularem
benevolentia^ erga famulum suum ostendit, Quod post mortem charis e^ jus ac
Germanis Filiis, Patris sui Successoribus^ Imperium donasset. This was the
signal loyalty, piety and devotion of the Christian Bishops, Priests, Nobles,
Senators, Soldiers and People of all sorts, in that Age, to this first
Christian Emperor Constantine, both living and after his decease, and to his
royal Posterity after him, worthy our imitation.

Constantine the 2d. Son of Constantine the Great, degenerating from his
Fathers Faith and Piety, favored the Arrian Heresy, and very much persecuted
the Orthodox Bishops, who maintained the Deity of our Savior Jesus Christ; yet
they and the Orthodox Christians ceased not to make constant fervent public
and private Prayers unto God for his long life, health and prosperous reign.
Among others Athanasius Bishop Alexandria, (the chiefest Anno 350.
Champion against the Arrians) though exceedingly persecuted, injured, deprived
and banished by him, merely for his zeal in defending the Orthordox Faith, and
the Godly Christians under his charge, were very loyal and conscientious in
discharge of this Duty, as is evident by these notable passages in his Apologia
ad Constantinum Imperatorem, against the Arrians calumnies, who falsely accused
him, for holding intelligence with Magnentius (the Murderer of his Brother
Constans) who wipes off that Calumny by this Argument, That he made Prayers for
this Prince in the open Assembly of the People, and likewise for the Emperors
safety, ( Operum (...) (...). 1627. ^om. ^ ^ 679, 6^0, ^82, (...).
) Pro salute tua vota facio. Quapropter dum te contemplatus fuissem in illo (

excusing the Peoples meeting in the great Church of Theona built by the
Emperor, before it was consecrated by his Order, because the multitude of the
people was so great, that the other Churches could not hold them; he adds,
Festum erat Paschae, and tanta vis populorum aderat, quantum Christianorum in
urbe esse Christicola Principes optarunt. Cum igitur and Ecclesiae paucae
parvaeque essent, magnoque tumultu posceretur ut in magna Ecclesia conventus
celebrarentur, atque ibidem Preces pro tua salute fierent, quod et factum est,
egone adhortationibus, etc. Nec tamen celebrata sunt a nobis Encaenia, sed
tantummodo precationum Synaxis habita est. Tu autem religiosissime Imperator,
ubinam malles populum manus extendere, et pro te orare, ibine, ubi Ethnici
oberrabant? an in loco tuum nomen titulumque referrente? quem cum in praesenti
Dominicum universi appellarent, etc. Ecce Domine Jesu Christ Rex Regum, very
Fili Dei unigeniti, verbum and sapientia Patris reus agor. Quia tuam
misericordiam Populus suis orationibus convenit, and per te, Patrem Deum omnium
imprecavit, idque pro salute Famuli tui pientissimi Constantii. Sed tamen
gratiae sunt tuae lenitati, quod de precibus Populi and de tuis ritibus in
crimen vocari. Tu tamen interim Deo dilectissime Auguste vivas per multos
Annorum recursus, and solemnia dedicationis perficias. Preces enim omnium pro
tua salute factae nihil impediunt Encaeniorum festum etc.

If then this Godly Orthodox Bishop, and all other Orthodox Bishops and
Christians thus constantly prayed to God for this cruel persecuting Arrian
Emperor, that Christ would be propicious to him, that he might continually live
in safety, and reign in peace, and live many years; and styled him, most
religious and gracious Empenor, and Prince; I shall thence infer, with our
learned Doctor Thomas Bilson against the Jesuits, in The true Difference
between Christian Subjection, and Unchristian Rebellion part 1. p. 378, 379.
Hear you deaf of ears, and dull of hearts: The Church of Christ prayed for
Heretical Princes in the midst of their Impiety and Tyranny: And when it was
objected to Athanasius, that he and others wrote Letters to one that rebelled
and took Arms against the Prince, he made Answer, Uincat quaeso apud te
veritas, etc. I bese^ch you let truth take place with you, and leave not this
suspicion upon the Catholic Church, as though any such things were written or
thought of by hristians, and especially by Bishops. How far then were these men
from your humors, which pro^esse to depose (yea murder) Princes, and not only
license Subjects to rebel, but entice them to kill their Sovereigns, as you did
lately Parr^, with pardon, praise, and recompense both here and in Heaven? Anno

St. Hilary Bishop of Poyctiers wrote thus to this Arrian * Hi^arius ad

The godly Western Bishops assembled by this Arrian Emperor Consta^tius to the
Council of Ariminum, and there long detained by him from their Cures, writ two
Epistles to him from thence, to dismiss them to their Bishoppricks before the
cold winter approached. In the first they write thus. We beseech you that you
cause us not to be ^anished, nor stayed from our Churches, but that the Bishops,
together with the people may live in peace and tranquillity, and may humb^y
pray for your Health, Kingdom and sa^ety, in which the Divine Majesty long
preserve you: Pro tua salute, Imperio, and pace orantes, quam tibi Divinum
largiri dignetur prolixam; so Nicephorus renders it; but others thus,
Supplicantes Deo pro pace tui Imperii pariter and salutis, quam tibi Dominus in
perpetuum largiatur. They conclude their second Letter to him in these words.

(...) Prayers together with the People, to the Almigh^y God, and our Lord and
Savior Christ for your Empire (or Reign) as we have always accustomed in
times past, and yet cease not to do, and now wish to continue. Here we have a
most pregnant double Testimony of all these Godly Bishops assembled in full
Council, of their own and the Peoples constant and continual Custom, both for
time past, present, and to come, to power forth ^ervent public Prayers,
Supplications and Thanksgivings to God, for the Health, Reign, Safety and
Prosperity of their Christian Emperors, though Arrians and Persecutors of them;
much more then was it their constant usage when Orthodox and Protectors of
them, thus to d^.

St. Cyril Bishop of Jerusalem thus recites the practice Anno 370.
of the Christian^ in his Age in this particular: We * Careches. 10. Dr.
Hamonds Annotations on 1 Timothy 2.
pray to God for the common peace of the Church throughout the world, For our
Kings, their Forces and Adherents.

St. Ambrose Bishop of Millain flourishing in the year of Christ 370. in his
Book, De Uocatione Gentium, l. 1. c. 4. Anno 37^.
reciting the 1 Timothy 2, 1, 2, 3. thus descants upon it. De hac ergo doctrinae
Apostolicae regula qua Ecclesia universalis imbuitur ne in diversum intellectum
nostro evagemur arbitrio, quid in ipsa universalis Ecclesia sentiat,
requiramus, quia nihil dubium esse poterit in praecepto si obedientia concordat
in studi^. Praecepit itaque Apostolus, (...) per Apostolum Dominus qui
loquebatur in Apostolo, Fieri obsecrationes, and postulationes, gratiarum
actiones pro omnibus hominibus, pro ^egibus, ac pro iis qui in sublimitate
sunt. Quem ^egem supplication is ita omnium (...) et omnium Fidelium devotio
concorditer tenet, ut nulla pars mundi sit, in qua hujusmodi Orationes non
celebrantur a populis Christianis: Supplicat ergo ubique Ecclesia Deo non solum
pro sanctis, and in Christo jam regeneratis, sed etiam pro omnibus infidelibus,
and inimicis crucis Christi; pro omnibus Idolorum cultoribus, pro omni^us qui
Christum in membris suis persequ^ntur; pro Judaeis, quorum caecitati lumen
Evangelii non refulget; pro haereticis and Schismaticis qui ab unitate fidei
and charitatis alieni sunt. Quid autem pro istis petat, nisi ut ^ relictis
erroribus suis convertentur ad Deum, accipiant fidem, accipiant charitatem, and
de ignor antiae tenebris liberati in a gnitionem veniant veritatis, etc. Which
he thus prosecutes in his Commentary on 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. Haec regula
Ecclefiastica est tradita a Magistro Gentium, qua utuntur Sacerdotes nostri, ut
pro omnibus supplicent; Deprecantes pro Regibus (...) seculi, ut subjectas
habeant Gentes, ut in pace positi, in tranquillitate mentis and quiet Deo
Domino servire possumus. Orantes etiam pro (...) quibus sublimis potestas est
credita, ^t in justitia and veritate gubernent Rempublicam, suppeditante rerum

sepositis omnibus quae huic Imperio infesta and inimica sunt, in affectu
pietatis and castitatis Deo servi^e possumus. Perturbatio enim and captivitas
nec pietatem servat, nec castitatem. Unde enim pius qui invidus est? and unde
^astitas ubi potestatis suae non est? In his Epistolarum, l. 5. Epist. 26. ad
Gratianum Augustum, he thus expresses his fervent Prayers for him. Et nocte
and die in tuis castris cura and censu locatus, Orationum excubias
praetendebam, and si invalidus merito, sed affectu sedulus. Et haec quidem pro
tua salute deferebamus, pro nobis faciebamus. Nihil hic adulationis est si scit
ipse arbiter quem fateris and in quem pie credis, me non solum officio publico
debitas pend^re preces, sed etiam amore privato. Which Epistle he concludes
with this Prayer for this Emperor. 'Beatissimum te and florentissimum Deus
Omnipotens Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi tueri aetate prolixa, et Regnum
tuum in summa gloria et pace perpetua, confirmare dignetur, Domine Imperator
Auguste, Divino elect judicio, Princiyum gloriosissimo. In his Epist. l. 4
Epistola 28. Ad Theodosium Imperatorem, he concludes with this Prayer.
Beatissimus and florentissimus cum sanctis pignoribus fruaris tranquillitate
perpetua Imperator Auguste. To pretermit all other passages of this kind, in
his Funeral Oration, De obitu Valentiniani Imperatoris, he has this passionat
expression, Nulla inhonoratos vos mea transibit Oration: Nulla nox non donatus
aliqua precum mearum contexione transcurret. Omnibus Oblationibus frequentabo,
etc. Q^am nostrae vitae temporibus fulcire curaremus, ut de nostris Annis
viveret, qui fungi non potuit suis: Which he thus concludes. Te quaeso sum
Deus ut clarissimos juvenes matura resurrectione suscites and resuscites, ut
immaturum hunc vitae istius cursum matura resurrectione compenses; to which
this other passage in his Oration, De obitu Theodosii Imperatoris, might be
added, See Bishop Vshers Answer to the Jesuits Challenge, p. 199, 200.
Da requiem perfectam servo tuo Theodosio, Requiem quam praeparasti sanctis
tuis.

This Godly Emperor Theodosius (as Annals, Oxoniae, 1656. p. 495, 496, 507,
508.
Eutychius Patriarch of Alexandria records) was by the joint and fervent
Prayers of the Christians in Constantinople (who spent the whole night in
Supplications, and beseeched God and our Lord Jesus Christ, ut nobis Regem
eligat, and quemcunque ipse elegerit nobis Regem praeficiamus) miraculously
elected and chosen Emperor, beyond all human expectation, being of a very poor
and mean condition, as he there relates.

Gregory Bishop of N^ssa in his excellent Book De Oratione, Anno 380.
p. 6. has this memorable passage. Oration corporum robur est, abundantia
domus, recta Iuris ac Legum in Civitate constitutio, Regni vires, belli
Trophaeum, pacis securitas, dissidentium conciliatio, conjunctorum conservatio,
etc. Therefore it was certainly used by all Christians, Churches, Bishops,
Ministers, Subjects, for their Kings and Kingdoms to effect these public ends,
especially in times of war and danger.

The 150. Godly ( (...), Eccles. Hist. l. 4. c. 1^ (...) Council. Tom. 1. p.

first General Council of Constantinople, Anno 381. in their Epistle to the
Emperor Theodosius, not only render public Thanks to God for advancing him to
the Empire for the peace of the Church, and maintenance of the Orthodox Faith,
but likewise pray to God for the establishment of his Empire in peace and
righteousness for many Generations, and his temporal and eternal joy and
beatitude, in these ensuing words, Initio quidem nostri ad tuam Poetatem

stabiliat, transmittatque et producat in multas et infinitas usque

Saints and Christians for him under his Empire, both in their Churches, Closets
and Epistles to him.

St. Jerome in his Commentary (and Caelius Sedulius too in Anno 390.
his Exposition on the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3.) press the duty of Praying for
Kings, though Pagans, and persecutors; in the same words and manner almost, as
St Ambrose, and Chrysostom, Theodoret, Primasius and Rhemigius (hereafter
cited) And Comment. in Danielem c. 6. v. 21. Tom. 4. p. 509. upon Daniels words
to King Nebuchadnezzar; Rex in aeternum vive; he thus paraphraseth: Honorat
honorantem se, et (...) vitam Impreca^ur ee^ernam, though cast into the Lions
den by his command.

St. Chrysostom Archbishop of Constantinople, though very Anno 400.
much persecuted by the Emperor and Empress for his zeal and piety, yet
zealously presses the duty of Prayer for Kings, and all in Authority, though
Infidels, and wicked, Homilia 33. in Epistolam ad Corinthios 1. c. 13. Quod
oporteat orare pro Infideli, audi quid dicat Paulus. Obsecro primum omnium

ii essent impii and iniqui, hoc quoque est perspicuum. Deinde causa^ quoque
orationis dicens, subjungit. Hoc enim bonum est and acceptum coram Deo
Salvatore, qui omnes homines vult salvos fieri, and ad agnitionem veritatis
venire. In his Homilia 6. in Epist. 1. ad Timotheum, c. 2. he thus comments on
these words of Paul. Quasi communis quidam totius orbis Pater, Sacerdos est:
dignum igitur est ut omnium curam agat, omnibusque provideat, sicut et Deus
cujus Ministerio servit and fungitur vice; idcirco ait, obsecro igitur primum
omnium fieri obsecrationes and orationes, etc. Quid autem sibi vult quod ait,
primum omnium? In obsequio scilicet quotidiano, perpetuoque divinae religionis
ritu. Atque id noverunt Fideles quomodo diebus singulis mane et vespere
Orationes (...) ad Dominum pro omni mundo et Regibus; et omnibus qui in
sublimitate sunt positi, obsecrationes ab Ecclesia fiant. Sed forte quis
dixerit, pro omnibus quod ait, tantum fideles intelligi voluisse. At id verum
non esse, quae sequuntur ostendunt. Denique ait, pro Regibus: Neque enim tunc
Reges Deum colebant, verum multis postea temporibus in infidelitate quam per
seriem successionis acceperant, perstiterunt. Deinde ut omnis assentationis
suspicio tolleretur, cum (...), pro omnibus, tunc demum, pro Regibus, addidit:
si enim tantum pro Regibus dixisset, (...) non deessent qui adulationis gratia
illum ita scripsisse putarent. Quoniam vero consequens esse cernebat, ut
Christiani animus ad ista torpesceret, neque hujusmodi admitteret monita,
siquidem pro Gentili Sacramentorum tempore Preces oporteret offerre, vide quid
secutus adjunxit, ut ex consideratione lucri admonitionem facilius,
libentiusque susciperent; ut quietam inquit and tranquillam degamus vitam. Ac
si diceret, in eorum salute securitas vestra consistit. Deus enim pro utilitate
communi hujusmodi Principatus instituerit. Quam igitur absurdum est, cum illi
idcirco militant, and arma circumferant, ut nos in tranquillitate atque ocio
simus, nos pro periclitantibus, ac nostri causa labores suscipientibus Preces
effundere detrectemus? Non igitur assentandi gratia hujusmodi mandatum dedit,
verum Romans 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Iustitiae servavit Leges: nisi enim illi servarentur, atque inter bella and
hosts prospere agerent, necessario and nostra omnia turbis tumultibusque plena
essent. Nam nos aut militare opus fuisset, ac per nosmet eadem subire pericula
concisis illis, aut fugere vagosque per orbem terrarum ferri. Sunt enim,
inquit, hujusmodi veluti obices quidam hostibus oppositi per quos nos in pace
servemur. Bellorum tria sunt genera, unum quod a Barbaris excitatur. Bellum
quod a Barbaris ingruit, Regum industria atque virtus sedat; quibus et nos
orationibus succurrere opus est, etc. Deprecationes inquit, orationes,
interpellationes, gratiarum actiones. Deo quippe oportet refer gratias etiam
pro sucessionibus aliorum; quod scilicet Mat. 5.
solemn oriri faciat super malos and bonos, and pluit super justos and injustos.
Vides ut ille non modo per orationis studium, verum etiam per gratiarum
actiones nos conjungat atque conglutinat? Qui enim necessario cogitur Deo
refer gratias pro felicibus proximorum successibus, ipsum quoque amore
compellitur sibique familiarius jungi. He adds much more in the Moral or use,
to like effect. In his Homilia 5. De incompraehensibili Dei natura, he has
this memo * Tom. 5. Operum Parisiis, 1588, col. 998.
rabble passage touching Prayer in general, and for a sick King in special.
Minime igitur agendum and pro his (insanis and haereticis) Preces agamus
supplicemusque Domino. Aptissima enim arma oration est, thesaurus certe
perpetuus, divitiae inexhaustae, portus quietus, occasio tranquillitatis,
denique author, parens, fons, and radix bonorum omnium and innumerabilium
oration est, atque etiam Regia ipsa facultate potior and superior. Saepius
itaque evenit, ut cum Rex ipse aegrotet, cubet, febriat, ardore laboret, and
adsint medici, adsint clientes familiares, Proceres, Milites, Duces; non ars
medicorum, non amicorum praesentia, non familiarium administratio, non
medicamentorum copia, non apparatus magnificentia, non pecuniarum facultas, non
aliud quicquam rerum humanarum possit reddere infestantem morbum leviorem. At
si quis valens familiaritate apud Deum accesserit, ac corpus languidum duntaxat
tetigerit, et sincere pro eo oraverit, languorem omnem expellet; and quod non
divitiae, non numerus Ministrorum magnus, non medecinalis scientia, non Regius
fastus efficere possit, hoc unius pauperis atque egeni oration potuit. Oratiouem
dico, non tamen illam and defidiosam, sed eam quae intenta examino dolente, and
cord contrito proficiscatur. Haec enim est quae in coelum scandere valeat. To
(...) all passages to this effect in his 15, 17, and 20. Homilies Ad Populum
Antiochiae, and in his two Homilies De Davide and Saul, I shall conclude with
these set forms of Prayers for Kings in the Liturgy or Mass, which is
attributed to Tom. 5. Col 1145. A. B. 1153. C. 1156. C.

St. Augustine de Civitate Dei l. 19. c. 26. thus presses Anno 410.
this duty, and the reasons of it. Quoniam quamdiu permixtae sunt ambae
Civitates, utimur and nos pace Babylonis. Ex qua ita per fidem Dei populus
liberatur, ut apud hanc interim peregrinetur. Propter quod and Apostolus (...)
Ecclesiam, ut oraret pro Regibus ejus atque sublimibus, 1 Timothy 1. 2.
addens, and dicens, ut quietam and tranquillam vitam agamus cum omni pietate
and charitate. Et Propheta Jeremias Jer. 29. 7.
quum populo veteri Dei venturam praenunciaret captivitatem, and divinitus
imperaret, ut obedienter in Babyloniam irent, Deo suo etiam ista patientia
servientes, monuit and ipse, ut oraretur pro illis, dicens, Quia in pace ejus
erit pax vestra; utique interim temporalis, quae bonis malisque communis est.
Pax autem nostra propria, and hic est cum Deo per fidem, and in aeternum erit
cum illo per speciem. In his book De Catechezandis rudibus, He prosecutes this
more largely. Extiterunt Reges Babyloniae sub quibus illi serviebant, qui ex
eorum occasion commoti quibusdam miraculis cognoscerent and colerent and coli
juberent unum verum Deum, qui condidit universam creaturam. Jussi sunt autem
pro eis orare, a quibus captivi (...), and eorum pace pacem sperare ad
gignendos filios, and domos aedificandas, and plantandos hortos and vinea^.
Post septuaginta autem anos promittitur eis ab illa captivitate liberatio. Hoc
autem totum figurate significat Ecclesiam Christi in omnibus sanctis ejus qui
sunt cives Hi^rusalem coelestis servituram fuisse sub Regibus hujus seculi:
Dicit enim and Apostolica doctrina; ut omnis anima sublimioribus Romans 13.
potestatibus subdita sit, and ut reddantur omnibus omnia, cui tributum
t^ibutum, cui vectigal vectigal, etc. Quae salvo Domini nost^i cultu
constitutionis humanae Principibus ^edditur. Quando and ipse Dominus, ut nobis
hujus sanae doctrinae praebe et exemplum, pro capite hominis quo erat indutus,
tributum luere non dedignatus est. Jubentur autem etiam servi Christiani and
boni fideles, Dominis suis temporalibus aequanimiter^fideliterque servire, quos
judicaturi sunt, si usque in finem iniquos invenerint, aut cum quibus
aequalicer regnaturi sunt, si and illi ad verum Deum conversi fuerint. Omnibus
autem praecipitur servire humanis potestatibus atque terrenis quousque post
tempus praefinitum, ab istius saeculi confusione tanquam de captivitate
Babyloniae sicut Jerusalem liberetur Ecclesia. Ex cujus captivitatis
occasion, ipsi etiam terreni Reges relictis idolis, pro quibus persequebantur
Christianos, unum verum Deum and Christum Dominum cognoverunt and colunt. Pro
quibus Apostolus Paulus jubet orare, etiam cum persequerentur ecclesiam. Sic
enim dicit (1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3.) Obsecro, etc. Itaque per ipsos data est Pax
Ecclesiae, quamvis temporalis tranquillitas temporis ad aedificandas
spiritualiter domos, and plantandos ho^tos and vineas. Nam ecce modo per i^tum
sermonem aedificamus atque plantamus, and hoc fit per totum orbem 1 Cor. 13.
terrarum, cum pace Regum Christianorum, sicut idem dicit Apostolus: Dei
agricultura, Dei Ecclesia estis. In his Book Ad Paulum Episcopum, paraphrasing
upon the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. showing the differences between Supplications,
Prayers, Intercessions and Thanksgivings, He adds, Pro omnibus hominibus, pro
Regibus, etc. ne quisquam sicut se habet humanae cogitationis infirmitas
existimaret ista non esse facienda pro his a quibus persecutionem patiebatur
Ecclesia, cum membra Christi ex eorum essent hominum genere colligenda. Unde
addit and adjung it, Hoc enim bonum est and acceptum coram Salvatore nostro
Deo; qui omnes homines vult salvos fieri, and in agnitionem veritatis venire.

Theodoret Bishop of Cyrene, in his Interpretation in Anno 430.
1 Timothy 1. 2, 3. pro Regibus, and omnibus qui in sublimitate sunt: thus
descants, Valde sapienter hominum commune p^aeposuit, ne quis orationem pro
Regibus assentationem existimaret. Quia enim e^ant Impii, qui tunc Dominatum
obtinebant, and pietatis aperti hosts, docet Iustam esse causam cur pro cis
oretur. Vt quietam and tranquillam vitam agamus in omni pietate and castitate.
Si enim illi in pace degant nos quoque sumus tranquillitatis participes, ac in
quiet ac silentio leges pietatis adimplemu^. Ita e^iam captivi Judaei qui
erant Babyloniae, 1 Esth. 6.
ad eos qui in Juda^ ^elicti erant, scripserunt, ut pro Nabuchodono^or et (...)
ejus filio Deo preces funderent. Dominus autem Apostolus non solum ubi est
causa (...) pro eis fieri orationes, sed etiam ut ab impietate cessantes,
ediscant pietatem: as he proves by the subsequent words. H^storia (...) Pa^
trum, p. 324.
Sanctorum enim deprecatio est commune omnium malorum remedium: non solum autem
medetur aegritudinibus corporis, sed etiam animis convenientem exhibet
cu^ationem; as he adds in the life of Maco. In his Interpretation upon Daniel,
c. 5. 10. And the Queen said, O King live for ever: Rex in secula vive, Rex in
secula vive. He writes, Haec autem erat praefatio qua subjecti Regibus, eos
tunc salutabant, and ad hoc usque tempus mos invaluit: quidem enim imperiti,
Reges eos, qui nunc sunt (...) vocare consueverunt: in syngraphis quoque
commerciorum hoc quidam ascribunt, stultitiae magis qu^m impietatis damnandi.
And c. 6. v. 21. Da^iel respondet, dicens, Rex in secula vive, etc. usitatam
praefationem sermonibus praeponit, videlicet, Licet et tibi Rex diutissime
vivere.

semper Augustis, made this prayer for them: Deus autem omnium, Regnum vestrum
multis annorum Revo utionibus custodiat pientissimi Uictores ac ^emper Augusit.
And in their 6. Epistle to these Emperors, the business being ended for which
they were convened, they prayed the Emperors to dismiss them from Ephesus. Ut
ordinationi futuri Episcopi incumbamus, and in fide jam and pietate confirmata
nos oblectemus, purasque et synceras pro Dominatione vestra preces Domino
Christo destinemus.

Primasius Bishop of Utica in Africa, in his Commentary, on 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3.
comments thus, Obsecratio firmior eratione est. (...) alit^r. Obsecrationes
sunt pro peccatis (...) is vel prae entilus; Orationes, pro adipiscendis que
sp^ramus; Postulationes cum pro aliis intervenimus; Gratiarum actiones, cum ea
quae possimus, impetramus, velcerte, pro universis Dei beneficiis gratias
laudesque referimus. Gratiarum actiones, Gratias agamus ei qui nos dignos fecit
pro aliis impetrare. Pro omnibus hominil us, etiam pro persecutoril us. Pro
Regibus omnil us qui in sublimitate sunt, ut quietam and tranquillam vitam
agamus in omni pietate and castitate. Ut cognoscant Deum, sive ut subjectas
habeant gentes: in eorum enim pace nostra consistit: si enim Christiani sunt
(...) persecutionis impetus.

Pope Leo the 1. flourishing about the year of Christ, Anno 450.
450. in his 24. Epistle to the Emperor Theodosius, writes thus: Ecce ego
Christianissime Imperator cum Consacerdotitus meis implens erga reverentiam
elementiae vestrae synceri (...) officium, cupiensque vos per omnia placere
Deo, cui pro vob^s ab Ecclesia supplicatur: and Epistola 25. to the same
Emperor, he has the same passage. In his 59. Epistle to the Emperor Martian he
writes thus, Unde ineffabiliter Deo gratias ago, qui eo tempore quo oboritura
Haereticorum scandala praesciebat, in Imperii fastigio collocavit; in quibus ad
totius mundi salutem, and regia potentia, and Sacerdotalis vigeret industria.
Epist. 60. to the Empress Pulcheria, he thus expresses himself: Per quam
significationem clementiae vestrae, absolute me gaudere, and incessabilibus a
Deo precibus postulare; ut vos et Romanae Reipublicae, et Catholicae Ecclesiae
in omni prosperitate conservet. In his Epist. 74. to the Emperor Leo, he
writes, Non desinimus gratias agere, and providentiam Dei in fidei vestrae
fervore Benedicere, qui sancto and Catholico Spiritu, ita Haereticorum
impudentiae restitistis, etc. His Epistola 78. to the same Emperor, begins
thus, Multo gaudio men's mea exultat in Domino, and magna mihi est ratio
gloriandi, cum clementiae vestrae excellentissimam fidem ingeri per omnia donis
gratiae caelestis agnosco, etc. And Epist. 99. to the same Emperor Leo, he
informs him, Sciat igitur clementia vestra omnes Ecclesias Dei cum laud vestra
exu^tare pariter et laetari: Inveniemur impares in gratiarum action, s^ nostri
tantum oris angustiis universalis Ecclesiae gaudia celebremus, etc.

In the General Council of Chalcedon, Anno 451. consisting Anno 451.
of no less than 630. Bishops and Fathers of the Church, they all unanimously
cried out several times with this acclamation, Multi anni Imperatoribus, Multi
Anni Augustae ( Placidiae) Multi Anni Imperatoribus; Multi Anni Imperatoribus;
Deus qui hoc fecit; Multi Anni Imperatorum; Magnorum Imperatorum Multi Anni;
Multi Anni Senatus; Multi Anni Judicum; Orthodoxorum multi anni. Haec integra
adunitio, haec pax Ecclesiarum. Piissimis and Christi amantibus nostris,
nostris Imperatoribus, Flavio Valentiniano and Flavio (...), victoribus ac
triumphatoribus semper Augustis, Multi Anni. After which diverse Archimandratae
(or Abbots) in their Epistle to the Emper^r Martianus, pray thus for him, Ut
iterum per sanctos Patres sancta fide confirmata, poss^mus reliquum tempus
vitae nostrae cast and pie vivere, and in pace incessanter consue^as orationes
offerre Domino nostro Christo pro diuturnitate aeterni vestri Imperii, qui et
sua bona voluntate invisibiliter nobis donavit Imperium divinissimi Augusti.
After this Actio 6. Martianus the Emperor making 2. Orations to the Council,
the one in Latin, the other in Greek, recorded in the Acts thereof, All the
whole Surius Council. Tom. 2. p. 142, 145, 197, 158, 162.
Council at the end of both his Orations cried out, Omnes clamaverunt; Multi
Anni Imperatori; (...) Council. Tom. 2. p. 142, 145, 197, 1^8, 162.
Multi Anni Augustae; Orthodoxis Multos Annos; Martiano novo Constantino Multos
Annos; Imperatori Multos Annos; Augustae Orthodoxae Multos Annos; Martiano
amatore Christi, vestrum nobis duret Imp^rium, sempex nobis Imperatis, digne ex
Orthodexa fide. Amatoribus Christi procul invidia. After this having tendered a
Confession of their Faith to the Emperor, Omnes clamaverunt. Omnes sic
credimus, etc. Martiano novo Constantino, novo Paulo, novo David multos Annos.
David Imperatori pro Domino vitam ci. Novo Constantino, novo Martiano. Uos
es^is pax orb^s, pie Domine. Dominus vitam e^ conservet. Vos, fides nostra.
Christus quem honoras, ipse te custodiet. Orthodoxam fidem tu roborasti. Sicut
Apostolici ita creditis. Augustae mu tos Annos. Uos lumina Orthodoxae fidei.
Propter haec ubique pax est. Lumina pacis, Domine tu custodi. Luminaria mundi,
Domine tu custodi. Perpetua memoria novo Constantino. Quae ex genere Orthodoxa
est, Deus eam custodiat. Eam quae semper p^a est Deus custodiat. Pia Orthodoxa,
quae contraria est Haereticis, Deus eam rustodiat. Omnes Haereticos tu fugasti,
Nestorium and Eutichen tu persecuta es. Absit invidia a vestco Imperio. Fideles
Imperatores sic honorantur. Deus custodiat Potestatem vestram. Deus pacificet
Imperium vestrum. Martianus novus Constantinus. Pulcheria nova Helena. Zelum
Helenae tu sectaris. Uestra vita, muninem cunctorum est, vestra fides,
Ecclesiarum gloria est. After which the Emperor rendering public thanks to God
for composing the manifold discords of those who had erred concerning the
Faith, and that now, in unam eandemque Religionem omnes nunc una voluntate
convenerimus, sperantes celerimam vestris ad Divinitatem Precibus, and curae
omnia pacem Nobis a Deo donari. Omnes clamaverunt. Haec digna vestro Imperio.
Haec propria vestri Regni, etc. Coelestis Rex, terrenum custodi. Per te firmata
fides est. Coelestis Rex Augustam custodi. Per te fides firmata est. Unus Deus
qui hoc fecit. Coelestis Rex Augustam custodi, dignam paci, etc. Per vos fides,
per vos pax. Haec oration Ecclesiarum: Haec oration Pastorum. After this again,
Omnes clamaverunt, multos Annos Imperatori; Multos Annos Augusto pio et
Christiano, Augustae Orthodoxae multi Anni. Multos Annos piae et matricae
Christi. Imperium vestrum Deus custodiat, etc. In perpetuum maneat vestrum
Imperium. After which in this Council, Actio xi. Bassianus Bishop of Ephesus
humbly petitioned the Emperors Valentinian and Martian to be restored to his
Bishopric, and Goods, of which he was forcibly dispossessed by Soldiers
without hearing, S^ius Council. Tom 2. p. 180, 181.
ut iis potitus, consuetas orationes r^feram incessanter Deo pro vestrae
Potestatis Imperio. It being the custom of that and former Ages for Bishops and
People to make Supplications, Prayers and Intercessions for the Emperors in all
their public Churches and Assemblies.

Explanatio, in Epist. Anno 490.
1. ad Tim. c. 2. 1, 2, 3. makes this abridgement of the Contents of this
Chapter, Vult pro Regibus and Magistratibus, fieri orationes, et gratiarum
actiones. Then explaining the Precept, Obsecro, etc. Beatus Apostolns dirigens
haec verba Timotheo, in illo tradidit omnibus Episcopis and Presbyteris,
omnique Ecclesiae formam, quomodo debent Missarum solemnia celebrare, and pro
omnibus hominibus orare: Quam formam, id est, Exemplum omnis Ecclesia modo
tenet, etc. Ne forte diceret aliquis; Non debemus orare pro Regibus
infidelibus, Jer. 29. 7.
and Judicibus ac Ducibus, ^uia Pagani sunt; praecepit Apostolus pro omnibus
hominibus orare: eodem spi^itu aff^atus quo and Hieremias Propheta; qui milit
Epistolam Judaeis, qui erant in Babylone, ut orarent pro vita Regis
Nebuchadonozor Filiorumque e^us, and pro pace Civitatis, ad quam ducti erant
Captivi; inquiens, Ideo debetis orare pro eis, quia in pace eorum erit pax
vestra: similiter and Apostolus reddit causam quare talia praecipiat: ut
tranquillam and quietam, id est Pacificam, vitam agamus in omni pietate and
castitate. Pietas est cultus, and Religio Omnipotentis Dei. Ideo ergo orandum
est se^vis Dei, Pro vita Regis, et pace (...), ut ipst liberius possint dedi. i
esse in cultu et Religione Dei. Quia plerumque dum hosts fugant servos Dei a
propriis sedibus, and discurrerent bella and seditiones per Regna, ut non
possint in cultura Dei esse intenti per omnia sicut tempo^e pacis. Pietas etiam
est miserico^, quam debemus impendere pauperibus and indigentibus. Si erg^
depraedamur ab hostibus, non possumus opus misericordiae exercere, quia non
valet impendere alteri, qui non habet unde semetipsum sustentet. Sed ut
habeamus, unde eleemosynam tribuamus, Orand^ est pro vita Regis ac Principum,
et pro pace Regni, and ut agamus vitam nostram in omni castitate corporis
tempore pacis; utcumque and nimia difficultate servari potest castitas. Quando
vero depraedatur Regnum a praedonibus and hostibus, nequaquam potest servari,
quia Domini qui depraedati sunt captivos, expleant voluntatem and immunditiam
suam cum eis, ut libet, nec valent resistere. Quapropter orandum est pro salute
et vita Fidelium Regum et Principum, ut longo tempore conservati pacem habeat
Regnum, et magis ac magis proficiant in melius. Pro infidelibus quoque orandum
est ut proficiant in melius et transeant ad fidem, etc.

Pope Gregory the 1. in his Epistles written to Emperors, Annno 600^
Kings and Queens, has many Prayers unto God for them, some of them recited in
the Here p. 7. 8.
precedent Chapter, relating to England, I shall insist only upon some others,
Epist. l. 4. Epist. 62 Mauricio Augusto, he has this passage. Tunc magis
Dominorum exercitus contra hosts crescit, quanto Dei exercitus ad orationem
creverit; by their Prayers, Tears and Fastings for the Emperor, Epist. l. 4.
Epist. 31. Mauricio Augusto, he concludes with this Prayer for him. Inter haec
ergo omnia incerta ad solas lachrymas redeo, petens, ut idem Omnipotens Deus
piissimum Dominum nostrum et sua hic manu regat, et in illo judicio liberum ab
omnibus delictis inveniat. Epist. l. 4. Epist. 34. Constantinae Augustae: he
has this passage. Et in Redemptoris nostri largitate confido, quia bonum hoc
in serenissimo Domino ( Mauritio) and pi^mis filiis in Coelestis quoque patriae
retributione recipietis. In omnipotenti autem Domino confido, quia longam
piissimis Dominis vitam tribuet; Lib. 5. Epist. 16. Mauritio Augusto, he
concludes thus. Quatenus Deus omnipotens, qui placitam sibi Catholicae
rectitudini^ integritatem clementiam vestram amare cernit atque defendere, Et
hic devictis hostribus pacatae vos Imperare Reipublicae, et cum sanctis in
aeterna faciat vita r^gnare. The like expressions he uses Epist. 59.
Brunichildae Reginae Francorum. He begins his 63 Epistle Mauricio Augusto,
with, Inter annorum curas, and innumerabiles sollicitudines quas indefesso
studio pro Christianae Reipublicae regimine sustmetis, magna mihi cum universo
mundo Laetitiae causa est, quod pietas vestra custodiae fidei, qua Dominorum
fulget Imperium, p^aecipua solicitudine semper invigilat. Unde omnino confido
quia sicut vos Dei causas religiosae mentis amore tuemini, Ita Deus vestras
Majestates sua gratia sue^ur et adjuvat. Lib. 6 Epist. 6. Mauricio August^; he
begins thus. Omnipotens Deus, qui pietatem vestram pacis Ecclesiasticae fecit
esse custodem, ipsa vos fide servat, etc. Pro qua re totis Precibus deprecamur,
ut bonum hoc Omnipotens Deus serenitati Dominorum, piaeque eorum soboli, et in
praesenti seculo, atque in perpetua remuneratione retribuat. Epist. 31.
Mauritio Aug^sto, he concludes with this Prayer for him. Omnipotens autem Deus
serenissimi Domini nostri vitam, et ad pacem sanctae Ecclesiae, et ad
utilitatem Reipublicae Romarae per tempora longa custodiat. Certi enim sumus
quia si vos vivitis, qui Coeli Dominum timetis, nulla contra veritatem superbia
praevalere permittetis, Lib. 7. Epist. 5. Brunichildae Reginae Francorum: he
ends with this Prayer for her. Omnipotens Deus sua vos protectione custodiet,
atque a per^dis Gentibus Regnum vestrum sui Brachii extensione defendat. Uosque
post longa Annorum ^urricula ad gaudia aeterna perducat. The like prayer he
makes Epist 42. Theodelindae Longobardarum Reginae, videlicet, Dei nostri
misericordiam deprecamur, ut bonorum vicem and retributionem in corpore and in
anima, hic and in futuro compenset, etc. Epist. 102. Theoderico and Theoberto
Regibus Franciae, he begins and ends thus: Summum in Regibus bonum est,
justiciam colere, ac sua cuique jura servare, and subjectis non sinere quod
potestatis est fieri, sed quod aequum est custodire, etc. Q^atenus per hoc
aequitatem Sacerdoti^us custoditis, Eorum Precibus an^e Dei semper occul^s
floreatis. Epistola 128. Richaredo Regi Wisigothorum, he is very copious in
rendering Thanks to God for him, as being a chief instrument in converting the
Goths to the Christian Faith, concluding with this Prayer for him. Omnipotens
Deus in cunctis A^ibus vestris, Coelestis Brachi^ extensione vos protegat,
vobisque et praesentis vi^ae prospera, et post multa annorum curr^cula gaudia
concedat aeterna. Lib. 8. Epist. 2. Mauri^io Augusto; he and the Clergy thus
prayed for him. Pro quare lachrymabili Prece omnes deposcimus, ut omnipotens
Deus qui Clementiae vest^ae corda compunxit, incolume in amoris sui constantia
Dominorum servet Imperium, ut victorias eorum in cunctis Gentibus auxilio suae
Majestatis extendat. See his Epistola 53, 54, 55, 56, 59, 60, 64. to several
Kings and Queens, wherein he renders t^anks and makes Prayers for them unto
God, Lib. 11. Epist. 1. he recites the murder of the Emperor Mauritius, with
all his 5. Sons, Brother, and some of his Nobles by Phocas; after which Phocas
who usurped the Empire, and Leontia his Empress sending their Statues to Rome,
7 Kal. Maij, Acclamatum est eis in Lateranis in Basilica Julii, Ab omni clero
vel Senatu, Exaudi Christ, Phocae Augusto et Leontiae Augustae vita: So much
did they flatter this bloody Murderer of his Sovereign Lord and his Royal
Issue, and Invader of his Crown. And Epist. 45. Phocae Augusto, Pope Gregory
himself thus courts and prays for him. Considerare cum gaudiis and magnis
gratiarum actionibus libet, quantas Omnipotenti Domino lauds debemus, quod
remoto jugo tristitiae ad libertatis tempora sub Imperialis benignitatis
vest^ae pietate pervenimus, etc. San^a itaque Trinitas vitam vestram per longa
tempora custodiat, ut de bono vestrae pietatis quod tarde suscepimus, ^iutius
gaudeamus. Lib. 11. Epist. 8. Brundechildae Reginae Francorum; He concludes
with this Prayer for her, Omnipotens Deus excellentiam vestram in suo timore
semper cu^todiat, atque ita vestra vota ad filiorum Excellentislimorum Regum
nepotum vestrorum sospitate adimpleat, ut stabile vobis gaudium de eorum semper
incolumitate sicut cupitis, habere concedat. And Epist. 9. Theodorico Regi
Francorum, De pace in republica facienda, (fit for our Age and Condition) he
prays thus for him. Sancta Trinitas in suo semper faciat vos timore proficere,
and ita cor vestrum placita sibi moderatione disponat, ut and subjectis vestris
de vobis, and postmodum vobis de se gaudium fine fine concedat. I shall
conclude with his Epist. l. 11. Epist. 46. Leontiae Augustae fraught with
Thanksgivings, Gratulations and Prayers for her. Quae lingua loqui, quis animus
cogitare sufficiat, quanta de serenitate vestri Imperii Omnipotenti Deo gratias
debemus, quod tam dura longo tempore pondera cervicibus nostris amota sunt, and
Imperialis culminis leve jugum subiit, quod libeat portare subjectis. Reddatur
ergo creatori omnium ab Hymnidicis Angelorum choris gloria in coelo,
persolvatur ab hominibus gratiarum actio in terra, quia universa Respublica
quae multa maeroris pertulit vulnera, nunc consolationis vestrae invenit
fomenta. Unde nobis necesse est Omnipotentis Dei misericordiam enixius exorare,
ut cor v^strae pietatis sua semper dextera teneat, ejusque cogitationes
Coelestis gratiae open dispenset; Quatenus tranquillitas vestra tanto rectius
valeat sibi servientes regere, quanto dominatori omnium noverit, minus
deservire. In amore Catholicae Fidei faciat Defensores suos, quos fecit ex
benigno opere Imperatores nostros. In^undat in vestris mentibus zelum simul et
mansu^m, ut semper pro fervore valeatis, et quidquid in Deo exceditur non
inultum relinquere, et si quid vobis delinquitur parcendo tolerare. Det vobis
in vestra pietate P^lcheriae Augustae clementiam, quae pro zelo Catholicae
Fidei in sacta Synodo Helena nova vocata est. Omnipotens Dei misericordia
largiora vobis cum prissimo Domino spacia vivendi concedat, ut quo vestra
longius vita extenditur, subjectorum omnium, consolatio validius confirmetur,
etc. Ipse ergo sit vestri custos Imperii, sit vobis Protector in terra, sit pro
vobis Intercessor in Coelo; ut per hoc quod relevatis duris ponderibus in
vestro Imperio subjectos gaudere facitis, post multa Annorum tempora in
Caelesti Regno gaudeatis.

Formularum, l. 1. c. 2. Concessio Regis ad Privilegium granted to an Abbey:
makes this the only usual form in that Age of Kings Confirmations of Lands, and
Privileges to Monasteries, expressed in their Charters: Ut pro aeterna salute,
vel faelicitate Regis, constanster delectet ipsis Monachis, immensam Domini
pietatem jugiter implorare. And c. 35. Confirmatio Regis, de omni corpore
facultatis Monasterii: Ut vos and successores vestri, uti necessitas fuerit, in
conditionibus ipsius Monasterii, Pro salute nostra crebrius exorare valiant.
And cap. 5. Praeceptum de Episcopatu: There is this clause in the usual form of
Kings Grants of any vacant Bishopric: Quatenus dum Ecclesiam sibi a
dispensatione divina commissam, strenue regere atque guberna^e videtur, Nobis
apud aeternum retributorem mercedem suffragia largiantur, and ille pro
peccatorum nostrorum mole, indesinenter immensum Dominum debeat deprecari. This
being one principal end of Kings erecting and endowing Monasteries, Bishoprics
and Churches, that the Abbots, Monks, Bishops, Priests and People might therein
constantly pray for the safety, prosperity and felicity of them, their Royal
Families, Posterity, Anno 681.
and Realms; as all their Charters, Confirmations, * Surius Council. Tom. 2. p.

The 2. Council of Toledo, Anno 681. under King Sisenandus: as it denounced
this solemn Excommunication thrice one after another, against all Traitors who
should attempt to m^der or dethrone the King, or us^p his Crown, against their
Oath of Allegiance to him. Quicunque ergo ex nobis, vel totius Hispaniae
populis qualibet conjuratione, tractatu vel studio, Sacramentum sidei suae quo
pro Patriae Gentisque Gothorum statu vel conservatione Regiae salutis
pollicitus est, teme^erit, aut Regem nece attractaverit, aut potestate Regni
exuerit, aut p^aesumpsione tyrannica Regni fastigium usurpaverit, anathema sit
in conspectu Dei Patris and Angelorum, atque ab Ecclesia Catholica, quam
perjurio prophanaverit, efficiatur extraneus, and ab omni Coetu Christianorum
alienus, cum omnibus impietatis suae sociis. Anathema Maranatha hoc est,
perditio in adventu Domini sint, and cum Juda Scarioth pa^tem habeant ipsi and
socii eorum. Amen. So also they made this devout Prayer for this King. Pax, and
Salus, et Diuturni^as piissimo and amatori Christi Domino nostro Sisenando
Regi. Corroboret ergo Christi gratia Regnum illius Gentisque Gothorum in Fide
Catholica Annis et meritis, protegat illum usque ad ultimam senectutem summi
Dei gratia, and post praesentis Regni gloriam ad aeternum Regnum transeat, sine
fine regnet, qui in seculo feliciter imperat, ipso praestante, qui est Rex
Regum et Dominus Dominorum, cum Patre and Spiritu sancto in secula seculorum.

Nativities, or aspiring after their Crowns, and reviling of them, under pain of

for their King. Donet ei Dominus and de inimicis triumphum, and de beatudine

him, Pro incolumitate atque exaltatione fortissimi vestri Imperii unanimiter
incessabiles Domino preces effundentes. Dei majestatem fideliter obsecrare pro
long vitate atque perfecta prosperitate vestrae fortitudinis Imperio divinitus
concedenda, etc. And this whole general Council thus unanimously cried out with
loud joyful Voices, and prayed to God for him ( Ibid p. 10^, 1024.
) Sancta Synodus exclamavit: Multos Annos Imperatori: Christo dilecto
Imperatori multos Annos. Pium and Christianum Imperatorem Damine conserva;
aeternum permaneat vestrum Imperium. Orthodoxam fidem tu confirmasti. After
which this whole Council in their Gratulatory Oration to him, pray thus for
him, Omnes unanimiter atque consonanter acclamamus; Domine Salvum fac Regem
nostrum, qui post te corroboravit fidei fundamentum: benedicito vitam ejus,
dirige gressus cogitationum ejus, conterat virtutem inimicorum suorum, et
resistentes ei continuo corruant, quia fecit judicium and justitiam
sempiternam, etc. This Emperor dying before this General Council dissolved, and
Justinian succeeding in the Empire,, all the Fathers assembled therein in their
( Ibid. p. 1039.
) Oration to him, close it with this Prayer for him, Dominus Imperium tuum

Sed tamen ex pleno quae dat amore fides.

pressing the duty of praying for Kings, as Remigius forecited.

Hincmarus Archbishop of Rhemes in France, flourishing Anno 810.
under Charles the Great, and Lewis his son, one of the learnedest Scholars
in that age, in his Bibl. Patrum Tom. 9. p. 42, 43.
Epistola 1. ad Ludovicum Balbum Regem, who desired his advice, how he might
settle and govern his distracted Kingdom in peace, in such a time of confusion,
as we now are in; returns him this answer, in an Epistle thus directed. Domino
Ludovico Regiglorioso, Sit semper Salus et Uita. 1. That he should elect good
Counselors of State, quia boni Reges constituti bonos sibi Consiliarios
adhibuerunt, and per bonos Reges and bonos Consiliarios regimen populi multa
bona habuerunt. 2ly. Ut Seniores et Regni su^ Primores convocaret, ut omnes
Communi Concilio de Communi Necessitate et Utilitate tractetis: (the best means
of public peace and settlement, as he proves by sundry former presidents;) nec
in exordio Regni vestri inter Primores Regni de vestro Regimine oriatur
discordia, quae non sine impedimento possit esse sedata. Et Regni Primores qui
vobiscum sunt, sic seipsos and suas voluntates contemperent, ne alios istius
Regni Primores ad scandalum per suam cupiditatem, aut negligentiam provocent.
3ly. That when this Great Parliamentary Council of the Nobles, and Great men of
the Realm should assemble, they should treat of these 6. Heads, very pertinent
and seasonable for our times.

Primo, qualiter vos in regimine Regni cum honor and salvamento, ac
supplemento de his quae necessaria sunt, cum Regno ac domo vestro possitis
insis^ere. Secundo, ut Capitulum, de honor sanctae Ecclesiae and Sacerdotum
and Servorum Dei debito privilegio ad effectum perduci possit; ut and Ecclesiae
in isto Regno per occasionabiles cicadas and per indeletas consuetudinarias
exactiones, quae tempore Pipini, Caroli and Ludovici non fuerunt, ante annos
viginti impositas, non affligantur. Tertio, qualiter Regni Primores cum debita
sereniate and honor erga vos consistere possint, and caeteri Nobiles homines
in Regno securitatem habeant, ne per diversa ingenia a suis opibus, quas habere
potuerint, despolientur: quia postquam radix omnium malorum cupiditas in Regno
isto exarfit, ut nullus, aut poene nullus honorem, aut aliquod bonum ^ine
precio possit adquirere, aut tenere, aut securitatem habere; pax, and consilium
and justicia, atque judicium, sicut necesse fuerat, locum in isto Regno non
habuerunt. Quarto, ut inveniatis cum Deo and vestris fidelibus, qualiter istae
rapinae and depraedationes in isto regno cessent, and miser iste populus, qui
jam per plures annos perde praedationes diversas and continuas and per
exactiones ad Normannos repellandos affligitur, aliquod remissum.
remedium habeat, and justitia and judicium quae quafi emortua apud nos sunt,
reviviscant: quia usque modo, jam ante plures annos locum in isto regno
defensio non habent, sed redemptio and tributum, and non solum pauperes
homines, sed and Ecclefias quondam divites tam emarciatas habent. Quinto, ut
concordiam quae secundum Deum est, inter fideles Dei and vestros haberi, and
vigere quantum potueritis, satagatis; and vos talem erga eos pr^paretis, ut
verum con^ilium vobis dare possint and audeant, etc. Sexto, ut inveniatis cum
Deo and ve^tris fidelibus, qualiter pacem and amicitiam secundum Deum cum
vestris sobrinis, patrui vestri filiis, and juvenum adjutorium vobis ad Dei
voluntatem, and sanctae Eccle^ae ac vestrum honorem, at communem fidelium
vestrorum Salvationem exhibeatis. Caeterum qualiter haee ad effectum
perveniant, et caetera necessaria inveniantur, et assequautur, Deus est
exorandus, etc. Faciendum est judicium pro iniquorum correctione, et pro
injuriam sustinentium directione, non pro malevolentiae ultione, nec pro justam
causam habentium oppressione, etc. Solicit unicuique ambulandum est cum Deo
suo, et Regi precipue, qui sub tantis erit in poenis in futuro seculo, si malus
fuerit, super quantos fuerit in isto seculo, in quo se a malitia non correxit,
et non fecit judicium et justitiam, et non ambulavit solicit cum Deo suo.

Ibid. p. 44, 54, 55, etc.
In the front of his 2d. Epistle to the Emperor Charles the Gross, Praesentem
et futuram optat prosperitatem et gloriam; advising him: Ut Ecclesiam
Gallicanam poene collapsam restituat, Regni dissidia tollat, Justitiae leges
apud Primores aeque ac subditos sartas tectas conservare, Divinum aux^lium per
preces crebro imperare, impios et sceleratos coercere; orphanorum et pupillorum
patrocinium suscipere; humilitatem, caritatem, mansuetudinem erga omnes
sectari, improborumque societatem et ^itatem defugere: as the readiest way to
public peace, unity and prosperity. His 3d. and 4th. Epistles are full of
excellent instructions for young Kings: and his 5th. very pertinent to our
Condition. The Emperor Jews the 2d. being dead, Charles the Bald King of
France went into Italy to obtain the Imperial Crown from the Pope: which his
Brother Jews, King of Germany, taking in ill part, attempted in his absence to
invade the Realm of France. Whereupon diverse Bishops and Nobles of France being
doubtful what to do in this difficult Cause, craved the advice of their
Metropolitan, Hin^rus Archbishop of Rhemes; who in this Epistle advises them
at large: In tanta discrimine, confug^endum esse ad arma spiritua^ta orationum,
jejuniorum, aliorumque id genus p^aesidiorum; et in fide proprii Regis Caroli,
licet absit, fort^r persistendum; nec oves ulla ratione, quantum vis Ludovicus
vi invadat regnum, deserendas, Ipsasque Reges libere de suis erratis
commonefaciendos, (...) ^i parere nolint, etiam a corpore Christi abscindendos;
quod multorum S. Patrum exemplis fuse probat. After his debate of the
difficulties and dangers on both sides in resisting the unjust Invador of his
Brothers Realm, and deserting Charles their absent lawful King, he resolves *
Ibid. p. 60, 61.
thus: Nos Episcopi Domini nostri Caroli, si acciderit ut consulere ei non
possimus, ficuti cupimus in temporali sui Regni defensione atque tuitione, et
consulamus ei in debitae Fide^ observatione. Consulamus et Nobis Dei
cooperatione in pia Dei erga illum observatione, et continua mentis devotione
atque pro eo apud Deum ^t Sanctos ejus obsecratione, etc. Consulamus et nobis
ne pro quacunque cupiditate vel temporali emolumento ab illius debita fide
exorbitantes, quenquam in illius regnum missis Episcopis, vel quibuscunque
internunciis, invitemus, nec pro Abbatiis, vel hono^ibus temporalibus, atque
rebus, vel facultatibus nos venundemus, Iudae similes effecti, qui abiens ad
Iudaeos dixit; Quid vultis mihi dare, and ego vobis eum tradam? Est etiam,
quoniam ab alio quocunque just and rationabiliter credi non poterimus neque
debemus, si quocunque terreno lucro vel illata injuria, salva in Deum fide,
seniori nostr^ (Regi) Fidem non servaverimus, etc. Consulamus etiam quantum
adjuvante Domino poterimus, Sociis and commilitonibus nostris, exhortantes eos,
ut fidem debitam apud eum observent, etc. Consulamus etiam ei, si forte quis
fuerit, qui in absentia ejus Regnum ipsius moliatur subripere, ut moneamus emn
de Sacramentis inter se, et Seniorem nostrum factis, quae Rex noster se servare
velle fatetur, et proponemus ei sententiam Domini prolatam per Jeremiam
Prophetam contra Sedechiam, qui juravit Nebu^hadonozor Gentili Regi in Nomine
Domini Ezech. 17. and Hierom. ibid. (whose severe judgment on him for this
Perjury he recites at large out of 4 King 25. together with the danger of
Perjury out of St. Augustine, Epist. 89. who styles it, Gravissimum peccatum) Si
autem and contra Praepofitum suum agentibus consulere non potuerimus; secundum
verba ( In 1 Epist. ad Tim. Epist. 26. 1 Timothy 3.
) sancti Ambrosii, consulamus Nobis, ne faciamus quacunque cupiditate, vel
adulatione, vel deceptione, vel communicatione unde vituperetur Ministerium
nostrum, and perdamus nomen bonum, etc. Et non solum in vectigalibus
stipendiariis militiae, and Ecclesiis debitis, et Regibus deservire jubemur,
verum et in Orationibus, sicut Augustinus in libro ( Lib. 19. ^. 26, 27.
) De Civitate Dei ostendir, (whose words he recites at large.) After which he
thus winds up this most learned and seasonable Epistle, worthy reading. Si
denique Rex noster fuerit, annuente Deo reversus, recipiamus eum cum gaudio,
and de sibi ac Ecclesiae atque Regni necessariis in postmodum procurare
Episcopaliter illum commoneamus, et prosperitati suae congaudeamus; si vero,
quod non optamus, aliter judicio Dei contigerit, Devotionem ac fidem debitam
erga illum sinceriter custodientes, ^icut scriptum est, dicamus cord, dicamus
and ore Domino, exultaverunt filiae Iudae, id est, confessionis humillimae, in
omnibus judiciis tuis Domine. This was the advice of that le^rned loyal Bishop
in that Age upon this occasion.

Gerbertus Archbishop of Rhemes, afterward Pope Anno 1000.
Sylveste^ the 2d. as he has this expression of his Loyalty * Bibliothec^
Patrum, Tom 10. p. 616 A. 617. H. 634. C.
to the Emperor Otho, Epist. 1. Non dicatur reus, cui pro Caesare stare semper
fuit gloria, contra Caesarem ignominia. So in his his 20. Epistle, Adelaidi
Imperatriei, he concludes thus: M^a sententia haec est, quam fidem filio
Dominae meae ^ Imperatori) asservavi, eam matri servabo; si nequeo praesens,
saltem absens, been loquendo, been optando, been orando. He begins his 154.
Epistle Othoni Imperatori thus. Domino and glorioso Othono semper Augusto
Gerbertus gratia Domini Remorum Episcopus, quicquid tanto Imperatori dignum.
And in his 31. Epistle to Diedericus the Bishop, Ibid^ p. 619.
in the person of Prince Charles the Emperors Nephew, he thus brands him for
his perjury and treachery to the Emperor, and the Republic. Diederico
Hypocritarum ideae, Imperatorum infidelissimo, prolisque parricidae, ac in
communi hosti Reipublicae. Tu divina and humana confundisti jura. Cur pastor
ali officio minas intendis? quasi vero tu pastor, and non lupus rapax, and non
potius alter Judas Apostolus, qui Dominum suum 30. perdidit argenteis, and tu
Episcopus qui Dominum tuum Regem Haeredem Regni Regno privasti spe famosissimi
quaestus, etc.

( Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 11. p. 6. F. p. 7. A. p. 9. 8. p. 22, 23, 24, 25,
26.
) Fulbertus Carnotensis Episcopus, inscribes his 3, 4, Anno 1010.
and 13, and 93. Epistles to Robert King of France thus. Domino suo Regi
Roberto lenignissimo, Fulbertus Dei and sui gratia Carnotensis Episcopus, in
gratia Regis Regum s^mper manner; statu plenae felicitatis; in perpetuum
regnare. Cursum honesti continuum ad beatitudinem finis. He concludes his 76,
77, 78, and 92 Epistles to this King, with Valeteregaliter; Vale nunc and
semper. Vigeat excellentia vestra. He inscribes his 96. Epistle with this
option: Aeterni Regis consortium; and ends it thus: Omnipotens Deus dilatet
Imperium vestrum, et dextra vos semper protegat ad pacem sanctae Ecclesiae;
Uitam vobis longae^am tribuat, et sua vos benedictione in omnibns exornet. His
97. Epistle is thus directed: Nobilissimo Regi Danemarchiae Cnuto, Fulbert. Dei
gratia Carnotensium Episcopus, cum suis Clericis et Monachis Orationis
suffrag^um. In which he writes: Te non modo Christianum, verum etiam erga
Ecclesias atque Dei servos benignissimum largitorem agnoscimus. Unde gratias
agentes Regi Regum, ex cujus dispositione talia descendunt; Rogamus ut ipse
Regnum tuum in vobis prosperari faciat, et animam tuam a peccatis absolvat, per
aeternum and consubstantialem sibi unigenitum Christum Dominum nostrum in
unitate Spiritus sancti. Amen. And his 150 Epist. is thus directed,
Dilectissimo Domino suo Roberto, Regi ac Reginae Constantiae, Verum in Domino
constantissimo Fulbertus humilis Carnot. Episcopus Fidelitatis obsequium et
orationum suffragium, quantum scit et potest. I preterm it his other prayers
and options of this kind, Epist. 89, 90, 91, etc.

Oecumenius in his Enarratio in 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. uses the Anno 1050.
self-same words and passages touching prayers, intercessions and supplications
for Kings, as St. Chrysostom and Theodoret, forcited, p. 111, 112, 116, etc.

The like does Theophylact, upon the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. Anno 1070.
whom they both follow.

St. Bernard Abbot of Clarevall thus begins and proceeds Anno 1130.
in his Epistola 45. ad Ludovicum Regem Francorum (written in the name of all
the Cistercian Abbots and Monks) Eximio Regi Francorum Ludovico, Stephanus
Abbas Cisterciensis, totusque Conventus Abbatum et Fratrum Cisterciensium,
salutem, sospitatem et pacem in Christo Jesus. Rex coeli et terrae regnum vobis
in terra donavit, donaturus et in coelo, si quod accepistis just and sapienter
amministrare studueritis. Hoc est quod Uobis optamus, et pro Uobis oramus, ut
et hic fideliter, et illic feliciter regnetis. Caeterum vos quonam consilio,
Eisdem Nostris pro Uobis orationibus, quas, si recolitis, olim tam humiliter
requisistis, modo tam acriter repugnatis? Qua enim fiducia manus pro Vobis
levare possumus ad sponsum Ecclesiae, quam ita et sine causa, ut putamus, ausu
inconsulto contristaris? Gravem siquidem adversum vos apud eundem sponsum, et
Dominum suum querimoniam deponit, dum quem acceperat defensorem, sustinet
oppugnatorem, etc. Alioquin si non meremur exaudiri, sed contemnimur, et nos,
fratres et amici vestri, et qui quotidie oramus pro Uobis, et Filiis Uestris,
et Regno; ex hac jam noveritis parvitatem nostram, etc. He begins his 170
Epistle, ad Ludovicum Juniorem Regem Francorum, with this loyal preface, and
seconds it with his constant prayers day and night. Si totus orbis adversum me
conjuraret, See Epistola ^2.
ut quippiam molirem adversus regiam Majestatem, ego tamen Deum timerem, and
ordinatum ab eo Regem offendere temere non auderem. Nec enim ignoro ubi
legerim; Qui potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit, etc. Non
contristabit per illum and de illo Ecclesiam suam, in quem et de quo in tantis
plura laetificavit: Quem suo munere contulit, sua longanimitate servabit; et si
quid aliter sapitis, et hoc ipsum vobis revelabit, et erudiet corda in
sapientia. Hoc optamus, hoc oramus die et nocte. He begins his 220 Epistle to
this King thus, Libenter quidem sicut ipse fateri dignamini, etiam propria
testante conscientia, quae ad honorem vestrnm et regni vestri utilitatem
spectant, pro nostro exiguo posse et quaerimus and quaeremus: though he sharply
reprehends him therein: In his 221 Epistle to this King (who oppugned the
Church) he writes thus. Profecto stabimus and pugnabimus usque ad mortem, si it
a oportuerit, pro matre nostra, armis quibus licet, non scutis et gladiis, sed
precibus fletibusque ad Deum. Et ego quidem qui me memini praeter Quotidianas
preces, quas pro Pace et Salute vestra, atque Regno coram Domino suppler ipso
test fundebam. And why so? Insuper et fratri vestro, ejusque militibus
balastariisque Domos Episcopales contra jus et phas inhabitandas, et res
Ecclesiae in hujusmodi nefarios usus profligandas audacter nimium exponitis.
Dico vobis non erit diu inultum, si haec it a facere pergitis, etc. His 255
Episile begins thus, Ludovico Dei gratia excellentissimo Regi Francorum,
Bernardus Clarevallis vocatus Abbas, fidelis suus, salutem a Rege Regum, and
Domino dominantium Ipsi, et Dilectae ejus, et Filiis ejus. Regn^ terrae and
jura Regnorum tune sane sana suis Dominis atque illaesa persistunt, si divinis
ordinationibus ac dispositionibus non resistunt, etc. He adds, Colligitur
Concilium. Quid in hoc detrahitur Regiae gloriae, regni utilitatibus? Ibi
Un^versae Ecclesiae commendabitur ac rememorabitur Excellenciae vestrae prompta
et specialis Devotio, qui Regum primus, aut certe inter primos rabiei
persequentium eandem matrem vestram strenuissime, et christianissime defendendo
obviastis. Ibi gloriose ab ingenti illa multitudine debitae gratiae referentur
vobis: Ibi a Millibus Sanctorum orabitur pro vobis et vestris. He begins his
138 Epistle, thus. Henrico illustrissimo Regi Anglorum, B. Abbas dictus de
Clarevalle, honorem, sospitatem and pacem. And his 139 Epistle, thus. Lothario
Dei gratia Imperatori Augusto, B. Abbas de Clarevalle. Si quid potest
peccatoris Oration, Benedictus Deus, qui vos elegit, et erexit cornu salutis
Nobis ad Laudem et Cloriam Nominis sui, et reparandum Imperii decus, ad
subveniendum Ecclesiae suae in tempore malo, Postremo, ad operandum etiam nunc
salutem in medio terrae. From all which passages it is most apparent, that this
devout Abbot, with all the Abbots, Monks, Clergy, and Councils in that age, did
constantly pray for their own Christian Kings, their Queens, Sons, Posterity,
and other Kings and Emperors, wishing all health, safety, happiness,
prosperity to them, and their Realms, for the Churches happiness, and did
bless God for their reigns, exaltations, successes, Piety, Zeal, and
Government.

Petrus Abbas Cluniacensis, Epist. l. 2. Epist. 7. Sigivardo Anno 1140.
Norwegiorum Regi, prefaceth his Epistle with this salutation; h Bobliotheca
Patrum, Tom. 12. pars 2. p. 53. 74, ^7, 80, 81, 108, 109, 128.
in praesenti faeliciter, in futuro, faelicissime cvm Christo regnare: and
begins it with this Thanksgiving to God: Omnipotenti et aeterno Regi toto
cordis affectu gratias agimus, qui menti vestrae favorem et amorem suum
inspirare dignatus, in vobis amorem coelestium terrenis affectibus praevaluisse
ostendit, etc. And thus closes it, Ipsi omnium bonorum largitori grates quas
possumus agimus; et ut hoc ad effectum perducere satagatis, votis omnibus
exoramus. Epist. 39. Glorioso Principi et magnisico Constantinopolitanae urbis
Imperatori, Joan ni Cale, he wishes, Salutem ab eo qui dat salutem Regibus:
beginning with this Thanksgiving. Gratias omnipotenti Regi Regum, cujus Regnum
Regnum est omnium seculorum, qui Imperatoriam Majestatem vestram super omnes
Christiani nominis Principes exaltavit, et ad tenendam toto orb Ecclesiam
suam, velut in medio Orientis, Occiedentis, Aquilonis constituit, etc. Et ut
aliquid beneficii spiritualis vo^is istud facientibus, rependamus, ficut
Praedecessores nostri ac nos ipsi, Reges Francorum, Reges Anglorum, Reges
Hispanorum, Reges Roman^rum, ipsos Impera^ores, ac vicinos vobis Reges
Ungarorum confratres et comparticipes omnium beneficiorum Cluniacensis
congregationis fecimus (by their daily Prayers for them) ita sublimitatem
vestiam, ex part omnipotentis Dei, etc. in eisdem et spi^itualibus benesiciis,
plen^ et perfect, in quantum licet, suscipimus: ut omnipotens Salvator et hic
temporale Regn^m vobis adaugeat et conservet, et in futuro, cum sanctis Regibus
vos ad sempiternum perducat. Amen. He begins his 46. Epistle to the King of
I^rusalem with the like Salutation and Thanksgiving to God. Epist^la l. 3.
Epist. 3. Illustri et religioso Regi Siciliae, Domino et amico R^tgerio, he
uses the very same Salutation, blesses God for him, and ends with this prayer
for him: Inde laetamur, inde in domino gloriamur, inde Celsitudinem vestram,
etsi vultu incognitam, verae dilectionis brachiis amplectimur: et ut ad honorem
nominis sui, et ad s^lutem populi sui omnipotens Salvator vestram regalem
potentiam magnificet et con^ervet, humiliter et frequenter precamur. Epist. l.
4. Epist. 37. to the same King Rotgerio: he wishes, Bonorum Regum dignitatem
et honorem: beginning it with Gratias omnipotenti Regi Regum, qui sublimitatem
vest^am inter universos Christiani orbis Reges ac Principes quadam specialis
magnificentiae gloria insignivit, quadam gloriosi nominis fama singulariter
exaltavit. Adding, Personam vestram Regnumque Omnipotenti Deo, Religiosisque
tam nostris, quam aliis congregationibus, studiosissime commendavi. Epistola 36
Illustri ac magnifico Principi, Domino Ludovico Regi Francor^m, is prefaced
with this option: Feliciter hic regnare, Regemque Regum in Regno ac decore fuo
videre: and begins with, Licet Regis aeterni militiam, quam per te Regem
terrenum contra inimicos crucis suae armare disposuit, ad peregrina euntem
comitari non valeam: Devotione tamen, oratione, consilio, et auxilio, quali
quantoque potero, prosequi concupisco, etc. I shall only add, Epist. l. 6.
Epist. 16. Magnifico Principi, domino Rotgero, Regi Siciliae, Frater Petrus
humilis Cluniacensium Abbas, Salutem praesencem et Regnum sempiternum.
Audientes obitum ^liorum, vestrorum valde doluimus, et t^m pro sospitate
vestra, quam pro omnibus illorum, Missas celebrari, orationes ad Deum fundi,
eleemosynas fieri, in conventu nostro praecepimus. Non solum autem nunc sed et
saepe diebus solempnibus et majoribus capitulis nostris, inter alios Reges
amicos et Benefactores nostros, vestri memoriam frequentamus.

Stephanus Tornacensis Episcopus, thus ends his Epistola Anno 1160.
39. Illustri, R. Hungariae Regi: Ualeat sanctitas vestra Biblio^heca Patrum.
Tom. 12. part 2 p. 502, 5^7.
et Regnum vestrum coram Domino. And he inscribes his 170 Epistle thus. Canuto
Illustri Dacorum Regi, Salutem, vitam et victoriam, and concludes it in this
manner, Ualeat et crescat in dies semper Magnificentia vestra.

I could draw down a continual series of Authorities almost every year, from
the year of our Lord 1200. till this present, pressing and practicing this duty
of Prayer for Kings, in public and private, in their Commentaries, Epistles,
and other writings; but to avoid Prolixity, I shall refer the Readers to Hugo
de sancto victore, Petrus Lombardus, Nicholaus Gorrhan, Anselmus Laudensis,
Petrus Commestor, Hugo Cardinalis, Dion. Carth^sianus, Nicholaus Lyranus, Hugo
de sancto victore, Isiodor Clarius, Vitus Theodorus, Johannis Sarisburiensis,
Alexander Alesius, Jo. Arboreus, Jo. Bradmyllerus, Tho. de Vio Cajetanus,
Calvin, Bulinger, Gualther, Hemmingius, Arrias Montanus, Nic. Hemingius, And.
Hyperius, And. Scaynus, Nic. Selneccerus, Dan. Tossanus, Fran. Titeburamus, Jo.
Brandmyllerus, Jo. Faber, Egidius Hunnius, Jo. Miyer, Alf. Salmeron, Guil.
Estius, Jo. Gagneius, Claud. Guilliandus, Cornelius a Lapide, Junius, Beza,
Marlorat, Lamb. Danaeus, Cl. Espencaeus, Ant. Fayus, Phil. Melancthon, Wolf.
Musculus, Jo. Piscator, Frid. Balduinus, Deodatus, Georg. Dibuadius, Georg.
Wenirichius, Adam. Sasbout, Pet. Steuartius, Jodoc. Willichius, Hug^ Grotius,
Dr. Hamond, and others in their Commentaries, Explanations, and Annotations on
the 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. the Harmony of Conf^ssions, Chapter of the Civil
Magistrate, who all press this duty in point of precept and practice, as well
for Pagan as Christian, vicious and tyrannical, as Virtuous and Gracious,
Heretical and Popish, as well as Orthodox and Protestant Kings and Emperors. As
for the Forms of public and private Prayers for them, I shall refer you to all
ancient and modern Missals, Processionals, Pontificals, Ceremonials, Psalters,
Primers, Letanies, Manuals, Books of Prayers and Devotions, which are almost
infinite in all Popish and Protestant Kingdoms throughout the World. I shall
only recite a few public Prayers of this Nature, for Example sake.

The 1. is M^ssa Aethiopum, Or the usual Forms of Common b Bibliotheca Patrum,
Tom. 15. p. 750 A.
Prayers used in all the Ethiopian Churches: wherein there are these, Preces
pro Rege Da Domine pacem, Regi nostro Claudio, et Principibus ejus, and
Judicibus ejus, and subditis ejus, orna eos omni genere pacis, Rex pacis pa^em
da Nobis, quoniam omnia dedisti Nobis.

The 2. is the ancient Prayers used for the Roman Emperors in Churches: Deus
Regnorum omnium and Christiani maxim Protector Imperii: Da servo tuo
Imperatori nostro R. triumphum virtutis tuae scienter excolere, ut qui tua
constitutione est Princeps, tuo munere sit Potens, Per eundem Dominum nostrum.

Deus qui ad praedicandum aeterni Regis Evangelium, Romanorum Georgii Cassaudri
Preces ^cclesiasticae p. 373.
Imperium praeparasti, praetende famulo tuo Imperatori nostro R. arma
coelestia, ut pax Ecclesiarum nulla turbetur tempestate bellorum, Per eundem
Dominum nostrum.

These two Forms of public Prayers are still retained in Missale Romanum ex
decreto Concilii Tridentini, Printed Salamanticae, 1588. Orationes ad diversa,
p. 81, 82. and Missale Romanum ex decreto Pii quinti Antuerpiae 1630. Orationes
ad diversa, p. 76, 77. to which there are these two Prayers, pro Rege subjoyned.

Quaesumus omnipotens Deus ut famulus tuus, N. Rex noster, qui tui miseratione
suscepit Regni gubernacula, virtutum etiam omnium percipiat incrementa: quibus
decenter ornatus, and vitiorum monstra devitare, and ad^te qui via, veritas and
vita es, gratiosus valeat pervenire. Per Dominum.

Munera quaesumus Domine, o^lata sanctifica, ut and nobis Vnigeniti tui corpus
fiant, Et Regi nostro ad optiennda^ animae corporisque salutem; et ad
peragendum injunctum officium, te largiente, usquequaque proficiant. Per eundem
Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum.

What other Prayers have been used for them, I have before transcribed, p. 40.
To which I shall add, that in most See Sacrae Litaniae Variae Antuerpiae 1629.
p. 217.
Litanies, there is this Prayer inserted. Et Regibus, et Principibus
Christianis pacem et veram concordiam donare digneris; te rogamus. Never more
seasonable to be used than now.

In the Pontificale Romanum, restored and published by command of Pope Clement
the 8. printed Antuerpiae 1627. p. 486, 487. There is this set Form of
receiving the Emperor, when he comes to any City, or notable Towu, by the
Clergy thereof in way of Procession, entitled, Ordo ad Recipiendum
Processionaliter Imperatorem. Quando Imperator venit ad aliquam urbem vel
oppidum insigne, Clerus urbis obviam venit ei Processionaliter, extra portam,
etc. Imperator, ex equo descendens, etc. sub baldachino ducitur usque ad
Ecclesiam. Processio praecedit immediate Imperatorem, etc. Whiles they go in
procession toward the Church, diverse Anthems and Hymes are sung; and when the
Emperor enters into the Church, the Bishop or Psalm. 7^.
chief Minister, turning toward the Emperor, says, Deum judicium tuum Regi
da: and the Chorus answer, Et justitiam tuam filio Regis, U. salvum sac N.
Imperatorem nostrum Domine. R. Deus meus sperantem in te. U. mitte ei auxilium
Domine de sancto. R. Et de Sion tueri eum. U. Nihil proficiat Inimicus in eo.
R. Et filius iniquitatis non opponat nocere ei. U. Fiat pax in virtute tua. R.
Et abundantia in turribus ejus. U. Dominus exaudi orationem meam. R. Et clamor
meus ad te veniat. U. Dominus vobiscum. R. Et cum spiritu tuo. Dremus.

Deus in cujus manu sunt corda Regum, inclina ad preces humilitatis nostrae
aures misericordiae tuae, Et Imperatori nostro famulo tuo N. Regimen tuae
sapientiae appone, ut haustis de tuo font consiliis, et tibi placeat, et super
omnia regna praecellat.

Praetende Domine quaesumus, famulo tuo N. Imperatori nostro dexteram caelestis
auxilii, ut te toto cord perquiret, et quae digne postulat assequi mereatur.
Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

After which follows p. 487, 488. Ordo ad recipiendum processionaliter Regem;
almost in the self-same words with some variation only in the Anthem; and this
Prayer.

Deus, cui omnis potestas and dignitas famulatur, da huic famul^ tuo Regi
nostro N. prosperum suae dignitatis effectum, in qua te semper timeat, tibique
^ugiter placere contendat. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

Ibidem p. 489. follows, Ordo ad recipiendum processionaliter Principem magnae
potentiae, little different from that of Kings. And p. 491. Ordo ad recipiendum
processionaliter Imperatricem vel Reginam. Where the responsory is fitted to
these Persons; and then this Prayer ensues. Oremus.

Deus, cujus providentia insua dispositione non fallitur, ineffabilem
clementiam tuam supplices exoramus, ut sicut Esther Reginam, Israeliticae
plebis causa salutis, ad Regis Assueri thalaemum, regnique sui consortium
transire fecisti: ita hanc famulam tuam Christianae p^ebis salutis gratia, ad
gratiam tuam transire facias; ^ut tibi super omnia ^ugiter placere desideret,
et te inspirante, quae tibi placita sunt, toto cord perficiat, et dextera tuae
potentiae illam semper hic et ubique circumdet. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.
Amen.

I shall cloze up this Chapter with the Decree of the Laur enrius Boche ^us
Decret. Eccl. Gal. l. 5. Ti^. 1. de Rege c. 2. P. 696.
Synod of Towers in France, Anno 1584. Imprimis, Deo optimo maximo haec Synodus
referendas gratias censuit, (prout refert) Quod divini ejus spiritus affl^tu,
Christianissimus Rex noster, Ecclesiae Dei statum ac ordinem modis omnibus
Roborare disponens; Conciliorum Provincia lium in universo Galliae regno
celebrationem gratam non solum habuerit, sed eam etiam indici procuraverit:
hi^c futurum sperans, ut quae summo nostro malo diutius gr^ssatae sunt
Haereses, radicitus extirpentur, and quibus turpiter Ecclesia deformatur,
prorsus aboleantur abusus, ac toti Galliae mult is jamdudum seditionibus, ac
perturbationibus afflictae, omnium bonorum votis desiderata pax plenissime
restituatur. Idcirco summopere exoptat, et humilibus a Deo precibus obnixe
contendit haec Synodus, ut Regem tam pium, tamque Religiosum fidei suae
conservatione stabiliat, aequa justitiae rogatione muniat, pacem et locupletem
reddat, misericordiae fulciat affectibus, virium fortitudine roboret, commissa
sibi Regni Gubernacula discreto moderamine tenere concedat, ut commissos sibi
populos benign regat, aeque judicet, et ad pietatis jura modificetur, illum et
piissimam Religiosamque ejus sponsam virili prole fructuosoque Regni successore
locupletet, ejusque optimam matrem, quam diutissime conservet. Itaque cum
sancta sit et Augusta Regum Majestas, sitque ut Sacrilegus et parricida, qui
vel re vel verbo tenus Regem violet; Quod priscis cautum est Conciliis, quodque
praesertim in Synodo apud Lauriacum pagum Andegavensem habita pridem fuit
constitutum, renovans haec Synodus statuit. Quandoquidem Religioni inimicum,
and hominibus constat esse perniciosum, futura curiosius perscrutari, and fata
Principum eorumque casus inquirere, cum seriptum sit; Non est vestrum nosse
momenta, vel tempora, quae Pater posuit in sua potestate: hoc Decreto censemns,
ut quisquis inventus fuerit talia perquisivisse, et vivente Principe de alio
Regni successore habendo confilium in^sse, sibique hac in re socios
conciliasse, a conventu Catholicorum excommunicationis sententia expellatur.

Quin etiam pro perversis hominum moribus emendandis salubri deliberatione
censemus, Ne quis in Principem maledicta congerat: Scriptum est enim a
Legislatore; Principem populi tui ne maledixeris. Quod si quis fecerit,
excommunicatione Ecclesiastica plectatur. Nam si maledici Regnum Dei non
possidebunt; Quanto magis talis ab Ecclesia necessario pellitur, qui divinae
sententiae violator, atque i^ Principem peccans, invenitur?

Si quis contra Regiam dignitatem dolose, callide et perniciose machinari
comprobatus fuerit, nisi dignissime satisfecerit, anathematizetur.

Si quis potestati Regiae (quae non est nisi a Deo) contuinaci ac inflato
Spiritu, contra anthoritatem et rationem pertinaciter contradicere
praesumpserit, et ejus justis Imperi^s obtemperare noluerit, anathema sit.

CHAP. VIII.
I Now proceed in the last place to the Solemn public Anno 565.
Prayers, Acclamations, Supplications, Thanksgivings, Collects, usually made at
the Solemn Coronations of Christian Emperors, Kings and Queens, and the Homage
and Oaths of Allegiance and Fidelity then commonly sworn to them by their
P^elates and Nobles, especially in England.

I shall begin with ( Co^ippus, lib. 2. La Ce^da An^otat. in Tertull. Apologet.
Mr. Se^dens Titles of Honor, p. 168. Cedren. Histor. col. 16. Zonaras, Annal

) Corippus, who poetically relating the manner of the Coronation of the Emperor
Justin, and his Empress Sophia, Anno 565, (he living in that Age) brings in
the Patriarch of Constantinople, thus praying for him, and the People
supplicating and praying for their happiness, long life, and prosperous Reign,
with united reiterated Shouts and Acclamations.

Postquam cuncta videt ritu praefecta priorum Pontificum summus, plaenaque
aetate venustus Adstantem benedixit eum, Coelique potentem Exorans Dominum,
sacro diademate jussit Augustum sancire caput, summoque coronam, Imponens
apici, etc. After which the People Justinum, Sophiamque pares duo lumina mundi
Esse ferunt. Regnate pares in saecula, dicunt; Felices Annos Dominis felicibus
orant; Inson^it vox illa diu; tandemque quievit.

of Constantinople, and particularly of the inauguration of Andr^mocis the
younger, Anno 1330. informs us, That the Patriarch of Constantinople ascending
upon a Scaffold: Patriarcha precationes ad Imperatorum unctionem compositas,
alias submissa, alias clara voce, omnibus audientibus ordine recitat, ac Deum,
ei qui ungendus est propitiat, etc. Patriarcha vero ad soleam consistens, pro
Imperatore, Imperatrice, et eorum populis Preces pronunciat. After which
Diaconus sublata voce inquit, Memor sit Dominus Deus potentiae Imperii vestri,
in Regno suo ubique, nunc et semper, et in secula seculorum, addens, Amen.
Deinceps et reliqui Diaconi ac Sac^rdotes adeuntes, idem comprecantur. After
his Consecration he ascends into the Catechumeum, where he may be seen of all,
where there is a Hymn Sung to his Praise, et sanctis Acclamationivus ab omnibus
excipitur.

Iodocus Coccius, and others apprehend, prescribes this form of Consecration,
Prayers, and Collects at the Empe^ors Coronation, which I shall recite, because
omitted by Mr. Seldom; it begins thus,

Incipit Ordo Romanus, ad Benedicendum Imperatorem
Orationem primam det Episcopus de Castello Albanensi ante portam Argenteam.
Oremus.
Deus in cujus manu corda sunt Regum, inclina ad preces humilitatis nostrae
aures misericordiae tuae, and Principi nostro regimen tuae appone sapientiae,
ut haustis de tuo font confiliis, and tibi placeat, and super omnia Regna
praecellat. Per Dominum.

Orationem secundam det Episcopus Portuensis intra Ecclesiam beati Petri
Apostoli, in medio rotae.

Deus inenarrabilis auctor mundi, ut supra scriptum est in ordinatione Regis.

Deinde vadat ante confessionem beati Petri Apostoli, and prosternat se pronus
in terram, and archidiaconus faciat litaniam. Qua finita, Episcopus Ostiensis
ungat ei oleo exorcizato brachium dextrum and inter scapulas, and dicat
orationem istam.

Domine Deus omnipotens cujus est omnis potestas and dignitas, te supplici
devotione atque humillima prece deposcimus, ut huic famulo tuo N. prosperum
Imperatoriae dignitatis concedas effectum, ut in tua dispositione constituto,
ad regendam Ecclesiam tuam sanctam nihil praesentia officiant, futuraque non
obsistant, sed inspirante sancti Spiritus tui dono, populum sibi subditum aequo
justitiae libramine regere valeat, and in omnibus operibus suis te semper
timeat, tibi jugiter placere contendat. Per.

Pontifex ergo stet sursum ante altar, and imponat ei diadema super caput,
dicens:

Accipe signum gloriae in nominae Patris, and Filii, and Spiritus sancti, ut
spreto antiquo host, spretisque contagiis omnium vitiorum, sic judicium and
justitiam diligas, and misericorditer vivas, ut ab ipso Domino nostro Jesu
Christo in consortio Sanctorum aeterni regni coronam percipias. Qui cum Patre
and Spiritu tuo sancto vivit and regnat Deus, per insinita secula seculorum.
Resp.

Amen.
Alia coronae impositio.
Accipe coronam a Domino Deo tibi praedestinatam, habeas, teneas, atque
possideas, and filiis tuis post te futuris ad honorem Deo auxiliante
derelinquas.

Exaudi Domine preces nostras, and famulum tuum N. ad regendum Romans imperium
constitutum, ut per te regere incipiat, and per te fideliter Regnum custodiat.
Qui vivit and regnat.

Oremus.
Prospice omnipotens Deus serenis obtutibus hunc gloriosum Imperatorem nostrum
N. and sicut benedixisti Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Require supra in
benedictione Regis.

Alia.
Deus pater aeternae gloriae, sit adjutor tuus and Protector, and omnipotens
benedicat tibi, preces tuas in cunctis exaudiat, et vitam longitudine dierum
adimpleat, et semper in sua voluntate custodiat, thronum Regni corroboret,
gentes populumquetuum ad nutum tuum subjiciat, et a peste et fame tuis
temporibus conservet, inimicos tuos confusione i^duat, et super te Christi
sanctificatio floreat, et super caetera regna excellentiorem faciat, ut qui
tribuit in terris imperium, ipse tibi in coelis cum electis suis conferat
habere consortium. Per.

To this (...) shall subjoyn the Ceremonies and Prayers made at the Coronation
of the Emperor of Russi^, recorded both in Latin and English in the Paul Od
rburn in vita Theod. Res^. (...) Lugd. B^t. 10, o p 284.
Marginal Authors.

The Solemities used at the Russe Emperors Coronation, are on this manner. In
the great Church of Precheste ( or our Lady) within the Emperors Castle is
erected a Stage, whereon stands a Skreen, that bears upon it the Imperial
Cap Dr. Giles, Fletch^r his Treatise of the State of Rusfia, c. ^. Mr. samuel
purchase his Pilgrim, l. 3 c 1: ^ 420, 421.
and Robe of very Rich stu^. When the day of the Inauguration is come, there
resort thither, first, the Patriarch with the Metropolitans, Abchbishops,
Bishops, Abbots, and Priors, all richly clad in their Pontificalibus. Then
enter the Deacons with the Q^ier of Singers. Who so soon as the Emperor sets
foot into the Church, begin to sing: Many years may live Noble Theodore
Juanowich, etc. whereunto the Patriarch Se^dens Titles of Honor, part 1. chapter 8.
p. 185, 186.
and Metropolitan, with the rest of the Clergy, answer with a certain Hymn, in
form of a Prayer, singing it altogether with a great noise. The Hymn being
ended, the Patriarch with the Emperor mount up the Stage, where stands a Seat
ready for the Emperor. Whereupon the Patriarch wills him to sit down; and
then placing himself by him upon another Seat provided for that purpose, boweth
down his head toward the ground and says this Prayer: O Lord God, King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords, which by thy Prophet Samuel did dest choose thy
Servant David, and anoint him for King over thy People Israel, hear now our
Prayers, and look from thy Sanctuary upon this thy Servant Theodore, whom thou
have chosen, and exalted for King over these thy holy Nations; anoint him with
the Oil of gladness, protect him by thy Power, put upon his Head a Crown of
Gold and precious Stones, give him length of days, place him in the seat of
Justice, strenthen his Arm, make subject unto him all the barbarous Nations.
Let thy fear be in his whole heart, turn him from an evil Faith, and from all
error, and show him the salvation of thy holy, and universal Church, that he
may judge thy People with justice, and protect the children of the poor, and
finally attain everlasting life. This Prayer he speaks with a low voice, and
then pronounces aloud: All praise and power to God the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost. The Prayer being ended, he commands certain Abbots to reach
the Imperial Robe, and Cap: which is done very decently, and with great
solemnity, the Patriarch withal pronouncing aloud: Peace be unto all. And so
he begins another Prayer to this effect: Bow your selves together with us,
and pray to him that reigns over all. Preserve him (O Lord) under thy holy
protection, keep him, that he may do good and holy things, let Justice shine
forth in his days, that we may live quietly without strife and malice. This is
pronounced somewhat softly by the Patriarch, whereto he adds again aloud: Thou
art the King of the whole world, and the Savior of our Souls; to thee the
Father, Son, and the holy Ghost, be all praise for ever and ever. Amen. Then
putting on the Robe and the Cap, he blesses the Emperor with the sign of the
Cross: saying withal, in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.
The like is done by the Metropolites, Archbishops and Bishops: who all in their
order come to the Chair, and one after another bless the Emperor with their
two fore-fingers. Then is said by the Patriarch another Prayer, that begins:
O most holy Virgin Mother of God, etc. After which a Deacon pronounces with a
high loud voice: Many years to Noble Theodore, good, honorable, beloved of
God, great Duke of Volodemer, of Mosko, Emperor and Monarch of all Russia, etc.
whereto the other Priests and Deacons, that stand somewhat far off by the Altar
or Table, answer singing, Many years, Many years to the Noble Theodore; The
same note is taken up by the Priests and Deacons that are placed at the right
and left side of the Church, and then altogether they chaunt and thunder out,
singing: Many years to the Noble Theodore, good, honorable, beloved of God,
great Duke of Volodemer, Mosko, Emperor of all Russia, etc. These Solemnities
being ended, first comes the Patriarch with the Metropolites, Archbishops and
Bishops, then the Nobility and the whole Company in their Order, to do homage
to the Emperor, bending down their heads, and knocking them at his feet to the
very ground.

To these Prayers and Acclamations used at the Coronations of Christian
Emperors, I shall only annex the Prayer of the very Turks themselves, at the
Coronation of their Mohammedan Emperors (which they doubtless derived from the
Christians) thus briefly related by Leunclavius. When Supplementum Annal.
Turcorum, Anno 1566. seldens Titles of Honor, p. 185.

I now proceed to the Prayers and Benedictions used at the Coronation of
Christian Kings and Queens, beginginning with those in foreign pa^ts.

Ordo Romanus Antiquus, de divinis Ecclesiae Catholicae Officiis, contains and
relates them in this manner,

Incipit Ordo ad Regem benedicendum, quando novus a clero and populo sublimatur
in regnum. Primum enim exeunte illo thalamum, Unus Archiepiscopus dicat hanc
Orationem.
OMnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui famulum tuum N. regni fastigio dignatus es
sublima^e, tribue ei quaesumus, ut ita in praesenti collecta multitudine
cunctorum in commune salutem disponat, quatenus a tuae veritatis tramite non
recedat. Per, etc.

Postea suscipiant illum duo Episcopi dextra laevaque honorifice parati,
habentes reliquias collo pendentes. Caeteri autem clerici solenni apparatu
ornati, praecedente sancto Evangelio and duabus crucibus cum incenso boni
odoris, ducant illum ad Ecclesiam, responsorium canentes: Ecce mitto Angelum
meum. Cum verse. Israel si me audieris. Cuncta eum plebe sequente: ad ostium
autem Ecclesiae clerus subsistat, and dicat alius Archiepiscopus hanc orationem.

Deus qui scis genus humanum nulla virtute posse subs^stere, concede propitius,
ut famulus tuus N. quem populo tuo voluisti praeferre, ita tuo fuleiatur
adjutorio, quatenus quibus potuit praeesse, valeat and prodesse. Per.

Introeuntes autem clerici Ecclesiam, hanc decantent antiphonam. Domine salvum
fac Regem, and exaudi nes in die qua invocaverimus te. Psalm. Exaudiat te
Dominus. Totum. Usque introitum chori. Tunc Dominus Metropolitanus dicat hanc
orationem.

Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, coelestium terrestriumque moderator, qui famulum
tuum ill. ad regni fastigium dignatus es provehere, concede quaesumus, ut a
cunctis adversitatibus liberatus, and ecclesiasticae pacis dono muniatur, and
ad aeternae pa^is gaudia, te donante pervenire mereatur. Per.

Tunc designatus Princeps pallium deponat, atque inter ^us Episcoporum
perductus in chorum usque ad altaris gradus incedat, cunctoque pavimento
tapetibus and palliolis contecto, ibi humiliter totus in cruce prostratus
jaceat cum Episcopis and Presbyteris hinc inde prostratis, caeteris autem in
choro litaniam breviter psallentibus, id est, duodecim Apostolos, totidemque
Martyrs, Confessores, and Virgins. Et inter caetera inferenda sunt ista.

Ut hunc famulum tuum illust. in Regem eligere digneris.

Te rogamus audi nos.

Ut eum benedicere, and sublimare digneris. Te rogamus audi nos.

Ut eum ad Imperii fastigium perducere digneris. Te rogamus audi nos.

Et caetera huic benedictioni convenientia. Finita litania erigant se Episcopi,
sublevatumque Principem interroget Dominus Metropolitanus his verbis.

Vis sanctam fidem a catholicis viris tibi traditam tenere, and operibus justis
observare? Resp. Volo. Vis sanctis Ecclesiis Ecclesiarumque ministris tutor and
defensor esse? Respon. Volo. Vis regnum tibi a Deo concessum, secundum
justitiam patrum tuorum, regere and defendere? Respon. In quantum divino fultus
adjutorio ac solatium omnium fidelium suorum valuero, ita me per omnia
fideliter acturum esse promitto.

Deinde ipse Dominus Metropolitanus affatur populum his verbis.

Vis tali Principi ac rectori te subjicere, ipfiusque regnum firma fide
stabilire, atque jussionibus illius obtemperare, juxta Apostolum, Omnis anima
potestatibus sublimioribus Romans 13.
subdita sit, Regi, quasi praecellenti: Tunc ergo a circumstante clero and
populo unanimiter dicatur. Fiat. Fiat. Amen.

Postea vero eo devote inclinato, dicatur ab Episcopo h^c oration.

BEnedic Domine hunc Regem nostrum illust. qui regna omnia moderaris a seculo,
and tali eum benedictione glorifica, ut Davidicae teneat sublimitatis sceptrum,
and glorificatus in ejus protinus reperiatur merito. Da ei tuo inspiramine cum
mansuetudine ita regere populum, sicut Salomonem fecisti regnum obtinere
pacificum. Tibi semper cum timore sit subditus, tibique militet cum quiet. Sit
tuo clypeo protectus cum proceribus, and ubique tua gratia victor existat.
Honorifica eum prae cunctis regibus gentium, felix populis dominetur, et
feliter eum nationes adornent. Vivat inter gentium catervas magnanimus, sit in
judiciis aequitatis singularis, locupletet eum tua praedives dextera,
frugiferam obtineat patriam, and ejus liberis tribuas profutura. Praesta ei
prolixitatem vitae per tempora, et in diebus ejus oriatur justitia. A te
robustum teneat regiminis solium, et cum jocunditate et justitia, aeterno
glorietur in regno. Per Dominum.

Omni potens aeterne Deus, creator omnium, Imperator Angelorum, rex regnantium,
dominusque dominantium, Genesis 14. Exodus 17. 1 Reg. 16. 3 Reg. 3.
qui Abraham fidelem samulum tuum de hostibus trumphare fecisti: Moysi and
Josue populo praelatis multiplicem victoriam tribuisti, humilemque David puerum
tuum regni fastigio subl^asti, and Salomonem sapientiae pacisque ineffabili
munere ditasti, respice quaesumus ad preces humilitatis nostiae, and super hunc
famulum tuum ill. quem supplici devotione in Regem elegimus, benedictionum
tuarum dona multiplica, eumque dextera tuae potentiae semper and ubique
circunda, quatenus praedicti Abrahae fidelitate firmatus, Moysis mansuetudine
fretus, Josue fortitudine munitus, Davidis humilitate exaltatus, Salomonis
sapientia decoratus, tibi in omnibus placeat, and per tramitem justitiae
inoffenso gradu semper incedat, Ecclesiamque tuam deinceps cum plebibus sibi
annexis ita enutriat ac doceat, muniat, and instruat, contraque omnes visibiles
and invisibiles hosts, eidem potenter regaliterque tuae virtutis regimen
administret, and ad verae fidei pacisque concordiam eorum animos, te
opitulante, reformet, ut horum populorum debita subjectione fultus, condigno
amore glorificatus, ad paternum decenter solium tua miseratione conscendere
mereatur. Tuae quoque protectionis galea munitus, and scuto inseparabili
jugiter protectus, armisque caelestibus cicundatus, optabilis victoriae
triumphum fideliter capiat, terroremque suae potentiae infidelibus inferat, and
pacem tibi militantibus laetanter reportent per Dominum nostrum, qui virtute
crucis tartara destruxit, regnoque diaboli superato, ad coelos victor ascendit,
in quo potestas omnis regumque consistit victoria, qui est gloria humilium, and
vita salusque populorum, qui tecum vivit and regnat Deus per omnia secula
seculorum.

Amen.
Deinde ab alio Episcopo haec dicatur Oration.
Deus inenarrabilis auctor mundi, conditor generis humani, gubernator Imperii,
confirmator regni, qui ex utero fidelis amici tui patriarchae nos^ri Abrahae
Praeelegisti regem seculis profuturum, tu praesentem Regem hunc ill. ^um
exercitu suo per intercessionem omnium sanctorum ubere benedictione locupleta,
and in solium regni firma stabilitate connecte. Visita eum ^cut Moysen in rubo,
Exodus 3. and 17. Judic. 7. (...) Reg. 3.
Jesum Nave in praelio, Gedeon in ag^o, Samuelem in templo, Et in illa eum
benedictione sidera, ac sapientiae tuae rore profunde, quam B. David in
psalterio, Solomon filius, te remunerante, percepit e coelo. Sis ei contra
acies inimicorum lorica, in adversis galea, in prospe^is patientia, in
protectione clypeus sempiternus, and praesta, ut gentes illi teneant fidem,
proceres sui habeant pacem, diligant charitatem, abstineant se a cupiditate,
loquantur justitiam, custodiant veritatem. Et ita populus iste pullulet,
coalitus benedictione aeternitatis, ut semper maneant tripudiantes in pace
victores. Quod ipse praestare dignetur qui tecum vivit.

Tunc Dominus Metropolitanus ungat de oleo sanctificato caput, pectus, and
scapulas, ambasque compages brachiorum ipsius ita dicendo: Ungo te in Regem de
oleo sanctificato in nomine Patris, and Filii, and Spiritus sancti. Et (...)
Reg. 1. 6.
dicant, Ane. Pax tibi. Et cum spiritu tuo. Deinde ungat sibi manus de oleo
sanctificato ita dicendo: Ungantur manus ista de oleo san^ificato unde uncti
fuerunt roges and prophetae, and sicut unxit Samuel David in regem ut sis
benedictus, and constit^tus Rex in regno isto super populum istum, quem Dominus
Deus tuus dedit tibi ad regendum ac gubernandum. Quod ipse p^aest.

Sequitur.
Prospice, omnipotens Deus, serenis obtutibus hunc gloriosum regem, et sicut
benedixisti Abraham, Isaac, et Jacob, sic illum largis benedictionibus
spiritualis gratiae cum omni plenitudine tuae potentiae irrigare atque
perfundere dignare. Tribue ei de rore coeli, and de pinguedine ^errae
abundantiam frumenti, vini and olei, and omnium frugum opulentiam ex largitate
divini muneris longa per ^empora, ut illo regnante, sit sanitas corporum in
patria, and pax inviolata sit in regno, and diguitas gloriosa regalis palatii
maximo splendore regiae potestatis oculis omnium fulgeat, luce clarissima
clarescat, atque splendere quasi splendidissima fulgura, maximo perfusa lumine
videatur. Tribue ei omnipotens Deus, ut fit for^issimus protector patriae, and
consolator ecclesiarum, atque coenobiorum sanctorum maxima cum pietate regalis
munificentiae, atque ut fit fortissimus regum, triumphator hostium, ad
opprimendas rebels and paganas nationes. Sitque suis inimicis satis
terribilis p^ae maxima fortitudine regalis potentiae Optimatibus quoque atque
p^aecelsis, proceribusque ac fidelibus sui regni sit magnificus and amabili^ et
pius, ut ab omnibus timeatur, atque diligatur. Reges quoque de lumbis ejus per
successiones temporum futurorum egrediantur regnum hoc regere totum, et post
gloriosa tempora, atque felicia praesentis vitae gaudia sempiterna in perpetua
beatitudine-habe^re mereatur. Quod ipse praestare, Spiritus sancti gratia,
humilitatis nostrae officio in te copiosa descendat, ut sicut manibus nostris
indignis oleo materiali oblitus, pinguescis exterius, ita. ejus invisibili
unguine delibutus impi^guari merearis interius, ejusque spirituali unctione
perfectissime semper imbutus, and illicita declinare tota mente and (...)
discas seu valeas, and utilia animae tuae jugiter cogitare, optare, atque
operare queas. Auxiliante Domino nostro Jesu Christo, Q^i cum Deo Patre and
eodem Spiritus. etc.

Deus qui es justorum gloria and misericordia peccatorum qui mifisti filium
tuum preciofissimo sanguine fuo genus humanum redimere, qui conteris bella, et
propugnator es in te-sperantium, et sub cujus arbitrio omnium regnorum
continetur potestas, te humiliter deprecamur, ut praesentem famulum tuum N. in
tua misericordia confidentem benedicas, eique propitius adesse digneris, ut qui
tua expetit protectione defendi, omnibus sit hostibus fortior. Fac eum Domine
beatum esse et victorem de inimicis suis: corona eum corona justitiae et
pietatis, ut ex toto cord et tota mente in te credens tibi deserviat, sanctam
tuam Ecclesiam defendat et sublimet: populumque a te sibi commissum just
regat, nullus insidiantibus malis eum in injustitiam vertat. Accende Domine cor
ejus ad amorem gratiae tuae per hoc unctionis oleum, unde unxisti Sacerdotes,
reges, et prophetas, ^uatenus justitiam diligens per tramitem similiter

Angelorum, Rex regnantium, Dominus dominantium, qui Abraham fidelem famulum
tuum de hostibus triumphare fecisti, Moysi et Josue populo praelatis
multiplicem victoriam tribuisti, humilemque David puerum tu^m regni fastigio
sublimasti, et Salomonem sa pientiae pacisque ineff^ili munere ditasti: respice
quaesumus ad preces humilitatis nostrae, et super hunc famul^m tuum N. quem
supplici devotione in regem elegimus, benedictionum tuarum dona in eo
multiplica: eumque dexter: tuae potentiae semper et ubique circunda, quaten^s
praedicti Abrahae fidelitate firmatus, ^oysis mansuet^dine ^etus, Josue
fortitudine munitus, Davidis humilitate exaltatus, Salomonis sapientia
decoratus, tibi in omnibus placeat, et per tramitem justitiae in offenso
ingress^ semper incedat. Ecclesiam ergo tuam d^inceps cum ple^bus sibi annexis
ita enutriat et instruat, contraque omnes visibiles et invisibiles hosts eidem
potenter rega^terque tuae virtutis regimen administret, et ad verae fidei
paci^que concordiam, eorum animos, te opitulante, reformet: ut horum populorum
debita subjectione fultus, cum digno amore glorificatus, ad paternum decenter
solium tua miseratione conscendere mereatur. Tuae quoque protectionis galea
munitus, and scuto insuperabili jugiter protectus, armisque coelestibus
circundatus, optabilis victoriae triumphum feliciter capiat, ter^remque suae
potentiae infidelibus inferat, and pacem tibi militantibus laetanter reportet,
Per Dominum nostrum qui virtute crucis tartara destruxit, regnoque diaboli
superato, ad coelos victor ascendit, in quo potestas omnis, regumque consistit
victoria, qui est gloria humilium, and vita salusque populorum, qui tecum vivit
and regnat Deus. s. Dei filius Jesus Christus Dominus noster, qui a Patre oleo
exultationis unctus est prae particibus suis, ipse per praesentem sacri ungu
inis infusionem, Spiritus paraclyti super caput tuum infundat benedictonem,
eandemque ad interiora cordis tui penetrare faciat, quatenus hoc visibili and
tractabili dono invisibilia percipere, and temporali regno justis moderaminibus
executo, aeternaliter cum eo regnare merearis: qui solus sine peccato Rex
regum, vivit and gloriatur, cum Deo patre in unitate ejusdem Spiritus sancti
Deus.

Postea ab Episcopis ensem accipiat, and cum ense totum regnum sibi fideliter
ad regendum sciat commendatum, and dicatur: Accipe gladium per manus
Episcoporum licet indignas, vice tamen and auctoriate sanctorum Apostolorum
consecratas, tibi regaliter impositum, nostiaeque benedictionis officio in
defensionem sanctae Dei Ecclesiae divinitus ordinatum. Et esto memor, de quo
Psalmista prophetavit, dicens: Accingere gladio tuo super femur Psalm. 44.
tuum potentissime, ut in hoc per eundem vim aequitatis exerceas, molem
iniquitatis potenter destruas, and sanctam Dei Ecclesiam ejusque fideles
propugnes ac protegas, nec minus sub fide falsos, quam Christiani nominis
hosts execres ac destruas viduas and pupillos clementer adjuves, ac defenda^,
de^olata restau^es, restaurata con^erves, ulciscaris injusta, confirms been
disposita, quatenus haec in agendo, virtutum triumpho gloriosus, justitiaeque
cultor egregius, cum mundi salvatore, cujus typum geris in nomine, fine fine
merearis regnare. Qui cum Patre and Spiritu sancto vivit et regnat.

Accinctus autem ense, similiter ab illis armillas and pallium et annulum
accipiat, dicente Metropolitano.

Accipe regiae dignitatis annulum, et per hunc in te Catholicae fidei cognosce
signaculum, quia ut hodie ordinaris caput et princeps regni ac populi, ita
perseverabis auctor a^ stabilitor Christianitatis, et Christianae fidei, ut
felix in opere, locuples in fide, cum Rege regum glorieris per aevum, cui est
honor et gloria per infinita.

Postea sceptrum and baculum accipiat, dicente fibi ordinatore.

Accipe virgam virtutis atque aequitatis, quia intelligas mulcere pios, et
terrere reprobos, errantibus viam pandere, lapsis manum porrigere, disperdasque
superbos, et releves humiles, et aperiat tibi ostium Jesus Christus Dominus
noster qui de seipso ait, Ego sum ostium: Joan. 10.
per me si quis introierit, salvabitur. Et ipse qui est clavis David, and
sceptrum domus Israel: qui aporit, and nemo claudit, claudit and nemo aperit.
Sitque tibi auctor, qui educit vinctos de domo carceris, sedentemque in
tenebris, et umbra mortis, et in omnibus sequi merearis eum, de quo Psalm. 44.
David propheta cecinit, Seeds tua Dcus in seculum seculi, virga aequitatis,
virga regni tui, et imitando ipsum, diligas justitiam, et odio habeas
iniquitatem: quia propterea unxit te Deus tuus, ad exemplum illius, quem ante
secula unxerat oleo exultationis prae participibus suis, Jesum Dominum nostrum.

Postea Metropolitanus reverenter Coronam capiti Regis imponat, dicens: Accipe
coronam regni, quae licet ab indignis Episcoporum tamen manibus capiti tuo
imponitur, eamque sanctitatis gloriam et honorem, et opus fortitudinis express
signare intelligas, et per hanc te participem ministerii nostri non ignores,
ita ut sicut nos in interioribus pastores, rectoresque animarum intelligimur,
^u quoque in exterioribus verus Dei cultor, strenuusque contra omnes
adversitates Ecclesiae Christi defensor, regnique tibi a Deo dati, et per
officium nostrae benedictionis vice Apostolorum omniumque sanctorum tuorum
regimine commissi, utilis executor, regnatorque proficuus semper appareas, ut
inter gloriosos athletas virtutum gemmis ornatus, et praemio sempiternae
felicitatis coronatus, cum redemptore ac salvatore Jesu Christo, cujus nomen
vicemque gestare crederis, fine fine glorieris, qui vivit et imperat Deus, cum
Deo patre in unitate Spiritus sancti, per omnia secula seculorum. Amen. Et ab
^o statim dicatur benedictio super eum, quae et tempore synodi super regem
dicenda est: Benedicat tibi Dominus custodiatque te, et sicut te voluit super
populum suum esse regem, ita in praesenti seculo felicem et aeternae
felicitatis tribuat esse consortem. Amen.

Clerum ac populum, quem sua voluit opitulatione in tua sanctione congregari,
sua dispensatione et tua administratione, per diuturna tempora faciat feliciter
gubernari. Amen.

Quatenus divinis monitis parents, adversitatibus carentes, bonis omnibus
exuberantes, tuo Imperio fideli amore obsequentes, et in praesenti seculo
tranquillitate fruatur, et tecum aeternorum civium consortio potiri mereantur.
Quod ipse praestare dignetur, cujus regnum et imperium sine fine permanet in
secula seculorum. Benedictio Dei Patris et Filii, et Spiritus sancti, descendat
super te. Amen.

Deinde coronatus, honorifice per chorum ducatur de altari ab Episcopis usque
ad solium canente clero: Resp. Desiderium animae ejus tribuisti ei Domine.
Deinde dicit sibi dominus Metropolitanus. Sta, et tene amodo locum, quem
hucusque paterna successione tenuisti, Not^.
haereditario jure tibi delegatum per auctoritatem Dei omnipotentis, et
praesentem traditionem nost^am, scilicet omnium Episcoporum (...) (...) Dei. Et
quanto clerum sacris altaribus propinquiorem perspicis, tanto ei potiorem in
locis congruis hono^em impendere memineris, quatenus mediator Dei et hominum,
te mediatorem cle i et plebis, Hoc in loco domin^ Metropolitanus sedere eum
faciat super sedem, dicendo:) in hoc regni solio confirmet and in regno aeterno
secum regnare faciat Jesus Christus Dominus noster, Rex regun^, and Dominus
dominantium, qui cum Deo Patre et Spiritu sancto vivit et regnat in secula
seculorum. Respon. Amen.

Post haec det illi oscula pacis. Cunctus autem coetus clericorum tali rectore
gratulans, sonantibus campanis, hymnum alta voce concinant, Te Deumlaudamus.
Tunc Episcopus Metropolitanus Missam celebret plena processione.

Incipit Benedictio Reginae in ingressu Ecclesiae.
OMnipotens aeterne Deus, fons and origo totius bonitatis, qui foeminei sexus
fragilitatem, nequaquam reprobando aversaris, sed dignanter comprobando ^otius
eligis, and qui infirma mundi eligaendo, fortia quaeque confundere decrevisti,
quique etiam gloriae virtutisque tuae triumphum in manu Judith foeminae olim
Judaicae plebi de host saevissimo resignare voluisti: respice quaesumus ad
preces humilitatis nostrae, and super hanc famulam Judith 13.
tuam N. quam supplici devotione in Reginam elegimus, benedictionum tuarum dona
multiplica, eamque dextera tuae potentiae semper and ubique circunda, ut ambone
muniminis tui undique firmiter prot^cta, visibilis seu invisibilis hostis
nequitias triumphaliter expugnare valeat, and una cum Sara, atque Rebeeca, Lia,
and Rachel, beatis reverendisque foeminis, fructu uterisui soecundari seu
gratulari mereatur, ad decorem totius regni, statumque sanctae Dei Ecclesiae
regendum, ne^non protegendum per Christum Dominum nostrum, qui ex intemerato
beatae Mariae Virginis alvo nasci, visitare ac renovare hunc dignatus est
mundum, qui tecum vivit and gloriatur, Deus in unitate Spiritus sancti per
immortalia secula seculorum.

Item benedictio ejusdem ante altar.
D^us qui solus habes immortalitatem, lucemque habitas inaccessibilem, cujus
providentia in sui dispositione non fallitur, qui fecisti quae ventura sunt,
and vocas ea quae non suut, tanquam ea quae sunt: qui superbos aequo moderamine
de principatu dejicis, atque humiles dignanter in sublime provehis, ineffabilem
misericordiam tuam supplices rogamus, ut sicut Hester reginam, Israelis causa
salutis, de captivitatis suae compede solutam, ad regis Assueri thalamum,
regnique sui consortium transire fecisti, ita hanc famulam tuam N. humilitatis
nostrae benedictione Christianae plebis gratia salutis, ad dignam sublimemque,
regis nostri copulam, regnique sui participium misericorditer transire
concedas: and ut in regalis foedere conjugii semper manens pudica, proximam
virginitati palmam obtinerc queat, tibique Deo vivo and vero in omnibus and
super omnia jugiter placere desideret, and te inspirante, quae placita sunt
toto conde perficiat. Per.

Sacri unctio olei.
Spiritus sancti gratia, humilitatis nostrae off cio, in re copiosa descendat,
ut sicut manibus nostris indignis, oleo materiali oblita pinguescis exterius,
ita ejus invisibili unguine delibuta, impinguari merearis interius: ejusque
spirituali unctione perfectissime semper imbuta, and illicita declinare tota
mente and spernere discas seu paleas, and utilia animae tuae jugiter cogitare,
optare, atque operari queas, auxiliante Domino nostro Jesu Christo, qui cum Deo
patre, and eodem Spiritu sancto vivit and regnat Deus in secula seculorum.

Coronae positio.
Officio indignitatis nostrae seu congregationis, in Reginam benedicta, accipe
coronam regalis excellentiae: quae licet ab indignis, Episcoporum tamen manibus
capiti tuo imponitur, unde velut exterius auro and gemmis redimita enites, ita
and interius auro sapientiae, virtutumque gemmis decorari contendas: quatenus
post occasum hujus seculi cum prudentibus virginibus sponso perenni Deo nostro
Jesu Christo digne and laudabiliter occurrens, Regiam coelestis aulae merearis
ingredi, qui cum Deo Patre, and Spiritu sancto vivit and regnat Deus, per
infinita secula seculorum. Amen.

To these I shall subjoyn the Prayers for and Benedictions of Christian Kings
and Queens at their Coronation, in Pontificale Romanum Clementis VIII. Pontif.

De Benedictione et Coronatione Regis.
CUm Rex est coronandus, Episcopi Regni ad civitatem, ubi coronatio ^eri debet,
convocantur. Rex triduanum jejunium devote peragit, per hebdomadam
praecedentem, videlicet quarta et sexta Feria, et Sabbato. Dominica vero
proxima sequenti coronatur, qua ipse Rex se ad Communionem parat. Ecclesia vero
ipsa Metropolitana, sive Cathedralis, ubi solemnitas celebrabitur, paretur et
ornetur, quo melius fieri poterit. Ad altar majus parantur ea quae consueta
sunt parari, Pontifice celebrante; et credentia juxta altar cum rebus
opportunis. Super altar ponitur gladius, corona, et sceptrum Regi danda, et
oleum Catechumenorum, bombyx ad ligan^um et extergendum brachium Regis, et
inter scapu^as post unctionem, fascia ad ligandum bombycem in brac^o. Paratur
in Ecclesia, in loco competenti, thalamus siv^ suggestum pro Rege, in quo sit
Regalis seeds orna^, et thalamus ipse sit ornatus pannis sericets, et au^s. Sed
advertendum est, quod al^tudo thalami non sit ma^r quam gradus supremus al^s.
Paratur exiam in loco convenienti tentorium, sive papilio, sub quo Rex vestes
Regales, pro Regni consuetudine, quae (...) pro eo parantur, suo tempore
recipit. Et si Regina etiam simul ^st coronanda, pariter pro ea illius ^amus,
non long. Regio, sed illo aliq^lum humi^r; et ita s^nt situandi thalami, ut
inde possint videri altar et Pon^fex celebrans. Parantur e^am ante altar hinc
et inde seeds, pro numero Episcoporum coronationi interessentium.

Die autem Dominica, qua Rex benedicendus et coronandus est, omnes Episcopi
convenient mane in Ecclesia, in qua hoc fieri debet; et Metropolitanus sive
Pontifex, ad quem spectat, parat se solemniter cum Ministris, Missam
celebraturus, paramentis tempori convenientibus. Episcopi vero ind^ur supra
rochetum (vel supra superpelliceum, si sint Religiosi) amictu, st^la, pluviali
a^bo, et mitra simplici. Quibus omnibus paratis, Metropolitanus in faldistorio
ante medium altaris posito sedet cum mitra, et Episcopi parati hinc et inde
super sedibus pro eis paratis, quasi in modum coronae sedentes, sibi assistunt.
Interim Rex vestibus militaribus indutus, cum suis Praelatis domesticis non
paratis, ac Baronibus, Nobilibus, et aliis, venit ad Ecclesiam; et cum fuerit
prope Presbyterium, duo priores Episcopi ex paratis veniunt e^ obviam, et cum
mitris capita illi aliquantulum inclinantes, ipsum inter se medium, birreto
deposito, usque ante Metropolitanum deducunt: cui Rex caput inclinans, humilem
reverentiam exhibet; qua facta, prior Episcoporum deducentium stans, detecto
capite, versus ad Metropolitanum, dicit intelligibili voce:

REverendissime Pater, postulat sancta Matter Ecclesia Catholica, ut praesentem
egregium Militem ad dignitatem Regiam sublevetis.

Interrogat Metropolanus:

Scitis illum esse dignum and utilem ad hanc dignitatem?

Ille respondet:

Et novimus, and credimus eum esse dignum, and utilem Ecclefiae Dei, et ad
Regimen hujus Regni.

Metropolitanus dicit:

Deo gratias.

Tunc sedet Rex medius inter duos Episcopos deducentes, congruenti spatio a
Metropolitano, ita ut illi faciem vertat; ip^ etiam deducentes Episcopi, senior
ad dexteram, alius ad sinistram Regis se collocant, ut et ipsi ad alterutrum
factes vertant. Quibus sic sedentibus, postquam aliquantulum quieverint,
Metropolitanus coronandum Regem admonet, dicens:

CUm hodie per manus nostras, optime Princeps, qui Christi salvatoris nostri
vice in hac re fungimur (qua^vis indigni) sacram unctionem et Regni insignia
sis suscepturus; been est, ut te prius de onere, ad quod destinaris, moneamus.
Regiam hodie suscipis dignitatem, et regendi fideles populos tibi commissos
curam sumis. Prae^larum sane inter mortales locum, sed discriminis, laboris,
atque anxietatis plenum. Verum, si consideraveris, quod omnis potestas a Domino
Deo est, per quem Reges regnant, et legum conditores justa decernunt, tu quoque
de grege tibi commisso ipsi Deo rationem es redditurus. Primum, pietatem
servabis, dominum Deum tuum tota mente ac puro cord coals. Christianam
religionem, ac fidem Catholicam, quam ab incunabulis professus es, ad fine^
usque inviolatam retinebis, eamque contra omnes adversantes pro viribus
defendes. Ecclesiarum Praelatis, ac reliquis Sacerdotibus condignam reverentiam
exhibebis. Ecclesiasticam libertatem non conculcabis. Justitiam, sine qua nulla
societas diu consistere potest, erga omnes inconcusse administrabis, bonis
praemia, noxiis debitas poenas retribuendo. Viduas, pupillos, pauperes, ac
debiles ab omni oppressione defendes. Omnibus te adeuntibus benignum,
mansuetum, atque affabilem, pro Regia tua dignitate te praebebis. Et ita te
geres, ut non ad tuam, sed totius populi utilitatem regnare, praemiumque been
factorum tuorum, non in terris, sed in coelo expectare videaris. Quod ipse
praestare dignetur, qui vivit et regnat Deus, in saecula saeculorum. Resp Amen.

Rex electus accedit ad Metropolitanum; et coram eo, detecto capite,
genuflexus, facit hanc professionem, dicens:

EGo N. deo annuente futurus Rex N. profiteor, et promitto coram Deo, et
Angelis ejus, deinceps legem, justitiam and pacem Ecclesiae Dei, populoque mihi
subjecto, pro posse and nosse, facere ac servare salvo condigno misericordiae
Dei respectu, sicut in consilio fidelium meorum melius potero invenire.
Pontisicibus quoque Ecclesiarum Dei condignum and canonicum honorem exhibere;
atque ea, quae ab Imperatoribus and Regibus Ecclesiis collata and reddita sunt,
inviolabiliter observare. Abbatibus, Comitibus, and vasallis meis congruum
honorem, secundum consilium fidelium meorum, praestare.

Defnde ambabus manibus tangit librum Evangeliorum, quem Metropolitanus ante se
apertum tenet, dicens,

Sic me Deus adjuvet, and haec sancta Dei Evangelia.

Postca Rex electus Metropolitani manum reverenter osculatur.

His expeditis, illo genuflexo manente, Metropolitanus, deposita mitra, surgit,
et stans versus ad ipsum coronandum, dicit competenti voce sequentem Orationem,
quam etiam dicunt omnes Pontifices parati, similiter sine mitris stantes;
dicunt etiam omnia alia benedictionem et coronationem ipsam concernentia, voce
submissa. Metropolitanum tamen in omnibus observantes, et imitantes.

Oremus.
OMnipotens sempiterne Deus, creator omnium, Imperator Angelorum, Rex Regum,
and Dominus dominantium, qui Abraham fidelem servum tuum de hostibus triumphare
fecisti, Moysi and Josue populo tuo Praelatis multiplicem victoriam tribuisti,
humilemque David puerum tuum Regni fastigio sublimasti, and Salomonem
sapientiae pacisque ineffabili munere ditasti; respice, quaesumus Domine, ad
preces humilitatis nostrae, and super hunc famul^m tuum N. quem supplici
devotione in Regem eligimus, benedictionum tuarum dona multiplica, eumque
dexterae tuae potentia semper and ubique circumda: quatenus praedicti Abrahae
fidelitate firmatus, Moysi mansuetudine fretus, Josue fortitudine munitus,
David humilitate exaltatus, Salomonis sapientia decoratus, tibi in omnibus
complaceat, and per tramitem justitiae inoffenso gressu semper incedat; tuae
quoque protectionis galea munitus, and scuto insuperabili jugiter protectus,
arm^sque coelestil us circumdatus, optabilis de hostibus sanctae Crucis Christi
victoriae triumphum feliciter capiat, terroremque suae potentiae illis inferat,
and pacem ti^i militantibus laetanter reportet. Per Christum Dominum nostrum,
qui virtute sanctae Crucis ta^tara destruxit, regnoque diaboli superato, ad
coelos victor ascendit, in quo potestas omnis, regn^que consistit victoria, qui
est gloria humilium, and vita salusque populorum: qui tecum vivit and regnat in
unitate Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Resp. Amen.

Post haec Metropolitanus cum mitra procumbit supra faldistorium. Rex vero ad
ejus sinistram in terram se prosternit, aliis Praelatis paratis ante seeds suas
similiter procumbentibus. Tunc cantores incipiunt, et prose quuntur Litanias,
choro respondente.

Cum dictum fuerit,

Ut omnibus fidelibus, etc.

Resp. Te rogamus audi nos.

Metropolitanus surgit, et accepto baculo pastorali in sinistram manum, super
electum Regem prostratum, dicit:

Ut hunc electum in Regem coronandum benedicere digneris.

R. Te rogamus audi nos.

Secundo dicit.
Ut hunc electum in Regem coronandum benedicere et consecrare digneris.

R. Te rogamus audi nos.

Producendo semper super eum signum Cru^is. Idcm dicant et faciunt Episcopi
parati, genuflexi tamen permanentes. Quo dicto, Metropolitanus redit ad
accubitum, cantoribus resumentibus, et perficientibus Litanias. Quibus finitis,
Metropolitanus, deposita mitra, surgit, ill^ prostrato, atque Episcopis,
deposita mitra, genuflexis manentibus, versus ad coronandum, dicit: Pater
noster.

V. Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

R. Sed libera nos a malo.

V. Salvum fac servum tuum Domine.

R. Deus meus sperantem in te.

V. Esto ei Domine turris fortitudinis.

R. A facie inimici.

V. Nihil proficiat inimicus in eo.

R. Et filius iniquitatis non apponat nocere ei.

V. Domine exaudi orationem meam.

R. Et clamor meus ad te veniat.

V. Dominus vobiscum.

R. Et cum Spiritu tuo.

Oremus.
PRaeteude Domine, huic famulo tuo dexter am coelestis auxilii: ut te toto
cord perquirat; and quae digne postulat, consequi mereatur.

ACtiones nostras, quaesumus, Domine, aspirando praeveni, and adjuvando
prosequere: ut cuncta nostra oration and operatio a te semper incipiat, and per
te coepta finiatur. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. R. Amen.

Post haec Metropolitanus sedet, accipit mitram, et electus Rex coram eo
genuflectit; et circumastantibus Praelatis paratis cum suis mitris in modum
coronae, Metropolitanus intingit pollicem dexterae manus in oleum
Catechumenorum, et inungit, in modum Crucis, illius brachium dexterum, inter
juncturam manus, et juncturam cubiti, atque inter scapulas, dicens hanc
Orationem.

DEus, Dei Filius, Jesus Christus Dominus noster, qui a Patre oleo exultationis
unctus est, prae participibus suis; ipse per praesentem sanctae unctionis
infusionem Spiritus, Paracliti super caput tuum benedictionem infundat,
eandemque usque ad interiora cordis tui penetrare faciat: quatenus hoc visibili
and tractabili oleo, dona invisibilia percipere, and temporali Regno justis
moderationibus executo, aeternaliter cum eo regnare merearis, qui solus sine
peccato, Rex regum vivit and gloriatur cum Deo Patre in unitate Spiritus sancti
Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R.

Amen.
Oremus.
OMnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui Hazael super Syriam and Jehu super Israel per
Eliam, David quoque and Saulem per Samuelem Prophetam in Reges inungi fecisti;
tribue, quaesumus, manibus nostris opem tuae benedictionis, and huic famulo tuo
N. quem hodie, licet indigni, in Regem sacra unctione delinimus, dignam
delibutionis hujus efficaciam, and virtutem concede: constitue, Domine,
Principatum super humerum ejus, ut sit fortis, justus, fidelis, providus, and
indefessus Regni hujus and populi tui gubernator, infidelium expugnator,
justitiae cultor, meritorum and demeritorum remunerator, Ecclesiae tuae sanctae
and fidei Christianae defensor, ad decus and laudem tui nominis gloriosi, Per
Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in
unitate Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

Quo facto, Metropolitanus lavat et abstergit manus, surgit cum mitra,
descendit ante altar; ubi deposita mitra, stans cum suis ministris facit
Confessionem. Rex vero electus ad partem se retrahit, et genuflexus cum suis
Praelatis domesticis idem facit. Similiter et Episcopi parati sine mitris
stantes, bini et bini Confessionem dicunt. Finita Confessione, Metropelitanus
ascendit ad altar, et procedit in Missa, more solito, usque ad Allelujah, sive
ultimum versum Lractus, vel Sequentiae, exclusive, Prae atis paratis jux^ suas
seeds stantibus, vel sedentibus, prout tempus requirit. Interim schola inchoat
Introitum, et prosequitur in Missa; et Rex a suis ducitur in Sachristiam, vel
sub papillione ad hoc parato, ubi inter scapulas et brachium inunctum bombyce
been abstergitur, et induitur Regalibus indumentis, ex more Regni Paratus
itaque Rex, et ornatus, procedit cum suis Praelatis, Baronibus, et aliis ad
eminentem et ornatum thalainum, in Ecclesia sibi praeparatum, et ibi super
a^quo faldistorio ornato genuflexus incumbens, audit Missam, quam Praelati sui
non parati circumstances etiam genuflexi legant usque ad Allelujah, sive
ultimum versum Tractus, vel Sequentiae, exclusive. Missa dicitur de die; et cum
Oratione diei, dicitur pro ipso electo Rege, sub uno per Dominum, haec Ora^o.

QUaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut famulus tuus N. Rex noster, qui tua miseratione
suscepit Regni gubernacula, virtutum etiam omnium percipiat incrementa; quibus
decenter ornatus, et vitiorum monstra devitare, et ad te, qui via, veritas, and
vita es, gloriosus valeat pervenire. Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium
tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in uni^te Spitus sancti Deus, per omnia
saecula saeculor^m. R. Amen.

Oraduali cantato, Metropolitanus sedet ante altar cum mitra in faldistorio,
et Rex a suis associatus medius inter priores Praelatos paratos ad
Metropolitanum reducitur; cui facta reverentia, ut prius, gen^it coram eo. Tunc
Metropolitanus accipit gladium, quem unus Ministrorum sibi porrigit de altari,
et illum evaginatum tradit in manus Regis, dicens:

ACcipe gladium de altari sumptum per nostras manus, licet indignas, vice tamen
and auctoritate sanctorum Apostolorum consecratas, tibi regaliter concessum,
nostraeque benedictionis officio, in defensionem sanctae Dei Ecclesiae
divinitus ordinatum; and memor esto ejus, de quo Psalmista prophetavit, dicens:
Accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum potentissime; ut in hoc per eunde^ vim
aequitatis exerceas, molem iniquitatis potenter destruas, et sanctam Dei
Ecclesiam, ejusque fideles propugnes ac protegas; nec minus sub fide falsos,
quam Christiani nominis hosts execres, ac dispergas; vid^ and pupillos
clementer adjuves, ac defendas; desolata restaures, restautata conserves;
ulciscaris injusta, confirms been disposita: quatenus haec agendo, virtutum
triumpho gloriosus, justitiaeque cultor egregius, cum mundi salvatore sine fine
regnare merearis. Qui cum Deo Patre, and Spiritu sancto, vivit et regnat Deus,
per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

His expeditis, Ensis a Ministris in vaginam repo^tur; et Metropolitanus
accingit ense Regem, dicens:

ACcingere gladio tuo super femur tuum potentissime, and attend, quod Sancti
non in gladio, sed per fidem vicerunt regna.

Et mox Rex accinctus surgit, et eximit ensem de vagina, illumque viriliter
vibrat; deinde super brachium sinistrum tergit, et in vaginam reponit; atque
^erum coram Metropolitano genuflectit. Tunc ei corona imponitur, quam omnes
Praelati parati, qui adsunt, de aitari per Metropolitanum sumptam manibus
tenent, ipse Metropolitano ^llam regente, capiti illius imponente, ac dicente:

ACcipe Coronam Regni, quae, licet ab indignis, Episcoporum tamen, manibus
capiti tuo imponitur. In nomine Patris, and Filii, and Spiritus sancti, quam
sanctitatis gloriam, et honorem, and opus fortitudinis, significare intelligas;
and per hanc te participem Ministerii nostri non ignores. Ita, ut sicut nos in
interioribus pastores rectoresque animarum intelligimur, ita and tu in
exterioribus verus Dei cultor, strenuusque contra omnes adversitates Ecclesiae
Christi defensor assistas; regnique tibi a Deo dati, and per officium nostrae
benedictionis in vice Apostolorum, omniumque Sanctorum, regimini tuo commissi
^tilis executor, proficuusque regnator semper appareas; ut inter gloriosos
athletas, virtutum gemmis ornatus, and praemio sempiternae felicitatis
coronatus, cum Redemptore ac Salvatore nostro Jesu C risto, cujus nomen
vicemque gestare crederis, ^e fine glorieris. Qui vivit et imperat Deus, cum
Patre and Spiritu sancto, in saecula saeculorum R. Amen.

Postea Metropolitanus dat ei adhuc (...) S^ptrum, dicens:

ACcipe virgam virtutis ac veritatis, qua intelligas te obnoxium mulcere pios,
terrere reprobos, errantes viam docere, lapsis manum porrigere, disperde^e
superbos, and relevare humiles: and ape^iat tibi ostium Jesus Christus Dominus
noster, qui de semetipso ait, Ego sum ostium, per me ^i quis introierit,
salvabitur: qui est clavis David, and sceptrum domus Israel; qui aperit, and
nemo claudit; claudit, and nemo ape^it. Sitque tibi ductor, qui educit vinctum
de domo carceris, sedentem in tenebris and umbra mortis: and in omnibus sequi
merearis eum, de quo David propheta cecinit, Seeds tua, De^s, in saeculum
saeculi; virga directionis, virga Regni tui; and imitando ipsum, diligas
justitiam, et odio habeas iniquitatem, quia propterea unxit te Deus, Deus tuus,
ad exemplum illius, quem ante saecula unxerat oleo exultationis, prae
participibus suis, Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum, qui cum eo vivit and regnat
Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen

Tunc Regi surgenti discingitur ensis, et in vagina datur alicui, qui eum ante
Regem immediate portat. Et Metropolitanns cum aliis Prae'atis paratis deducit
Regem, sceptrum in manu et coronam in capite f^tem medium inter se a dexteris,
et digniorem Praelatum paratum a sinistris Regis incedentom, ad solium supra
thalamum; et adjuvante cum digniore P^ato praedicto, inthronizat Regem in
solio, dicens:

STa, and retine amodo locum tibi a Deo delegatum, per auctoritatem
omnipotentis Dei, and per praesen em traditionem nostram, omnium scilicet
Episcoporum, caete^orumque Dei servorum; and quanto Clerum sacris altaribus
propinquiorem perspicis, tanto ei potiorem in locis congruis honorem impendere
memineris; quatenus mediator Dei and hominum te mediatorem Cleri et plebis
permanere faciat.

Deinde Me^ropolitanus, deposita mitra, stans versus ad altar inchoat, Schola
prosequente, Hymnum:

Te Deum laudamus.

Qui totus dicitur: quo incepto, Metropolitanus accedit ad dextram Regis: ibi
continuo manens, usque ad finem Hymni; et eo finito, Metropolitanus stans, ut
prius, ad dexteram Regis sine mitra, dicit super illum versus.

Firmetur manus tua, et exaltetur dextera tua.

R. Justitia et judicium praeparatio sedis tuae.

V. Domine exaudi orationem meam.

R. Et clamor meus ad te veniat.

V. Dominus vobiscum.

R. Et cum Spiritu tuo.

Oremus.
DEus, qui victrices Moysi manus in oratione firmasti, qui quamvis aetate
languesceret, infatigabili sanctitate pugnabat; ut dum Amalech iniquus
vincitur, dum profanus nationum populus subjugatur, exterminatis alienigenis,
hereditati tuae possessio copiosa servi^et; opus manuum tuarum pia n^strae
orationis exauditione confirma: habemus and nos apud te, sancte Pater, Dominum
salvatorem, qui pro nobis manus suas extendit in cruce; per quem etiam
precamur, Altissime, ut, tua pctentia suffragante universorum hostium frangatur
impietas; populusque tuus, cessante formidine, te solum timere condiscat. Per
eundem Cbristum Dominum nostrum. R.

Amen.
Oremus.
DEus inenarabilis auctor mundi, conditor generis humani, confirmator Regni,
qui ex utero fidelis amici tui Patriarchae nostri Abrahae praeelegisti Regem
saeculis profuturum: tu praesentem insignem Regem hunc cum exercitu suo per
intercessionem beatae Maria semper virginis, and omnium Sanctorum, uberi
be^edictione locupleta, and in solium Regni firma stabilitate connecte: visita
eum, sicut visitasti Mcysen in rubo, Josu^ in praelio, Gedeonem in agro,
Samuelem in templo; and illa eum siderea benedictione, ac sapientiae t^ae rore
perfunde, quam beatus David in Psalterio, Solomon filius ejus, te remunerante,
percepit de coelo. Sis ei contra acies inimicorum lorica, in adversis galea, in
prosperis sapientia, in protectione clypeus sempiternus. Et praesta, ut gentes
illi teneant fidem, Pro^eres sui habeant pacem, diligant charitatem, abstineant
se a cupiditate, loquantur justitiam, custodiant veritatem: and ita populus
iste sub ejus imperio pullulet, coalitus benedictione aeternitatis; ut semper
tripudiantes maneant in pace, ac ^ictores. Quod ipse praestare dignetur, qui
tecum vivit and regnat in unitate Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula
saeculorum. R. Amen.

Quibus finitis, Metropolitanus cum Prae'atis paratis redit ad sedem suam, vel
faldistorium prope altar, et (nisi sit coronanda Regina) dicitur Alleluia,
sive ultimus versus Tractus, vel Sequentiae Evangelium, et alia usque ad
Offertorium inclusive. Quo dicto, Metropolitanus residet in faldistorio suo
ante medium altaris cum mitra; et Rex a suis Praelatis, et Baronibus
associatus, venit ante Metropolitanum, coram quo genuflexus, detecto capite,
offert ei aurum, quantum sibi placet, et manum Metropolitani recipientis
osculatur. Deinde ad solium suum revertitur. Metropolitanus lavat manus,
surgensque accedit ad altar, et prosequitur Missam usque ad Communionem.

Cum Secreta diei dicitur pro Rege, sub uno Per Deminum nostrum.

Secreta.
MUnera, quaesumus Domine, oblata sanctifica: ut et nobis Unigeniti tui Corpus
et Sanguis fiant; et Regi nostro ad obtinendam animae corporisque salutem, et
ad peragendum injunct^m officium, te largiente, usquequaque proficiant. Per
e^ndem Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum silium tuum, qui teeum vivit et^ egnat in
unitate Spi^itus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

Pax d^ur Regi per primum ex Praelatis paratis, cum instrum^nto ad hoc
ordinato. Postquam Metropolitanus se de Corpore, et Sanguine, quem totum sumere
debet, communicaverit; Rex, detecto capite, de thal^mo suo accedit ad al^are,
coram quo, in supremo gradu genuflectit, et Metropol^anus conversus ad Regem,
ipsum communicate. Rex, priusquam Communionem suma^, osculatur manum dexteram
Metropolitani; et sumpta Communione, ex calice de manu Metropolitani se
purificat, et purifica^us ad thalamum suum revertitur. Metropolitanus vero
^blutionem sumit; et accepta mitra, lavat manus, e^ perficit Mifsam.

Cum Postcommunione diei, dicitur pro Rege, sub uno Per Dominum,

Postcommunio.
HAec, Domine, oblatio salutaris famulum N. Regem nostrum ab omnibus tueatur
adversis; quatenus Eccle^iasticae pacis obtineat tranquillitatem, and post
istius temporis decursum ad aeternam perveniat haereditatem. Per Dominum
nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in unitate
Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

In fine Metropolitanus dat benedictionem solemnem, ^s supra; qua data, singuli
ad sua revertuntur.

De Benedictione and Coronatione Reginae.
SIvero tunc Regina benedicenda sit et coronanda, quam primum, ipso Rege
inthronizato, et Orationibus expletis, Metropolitanus cum Praelatis paratis ad
altar reversus in faldistorio sedet. Rex de solio suo surgens, cum comitiva
sua, coronam in capite et sceptrum in manu gestans, ante Altar ad
Metropolitanum proficiscitur; et facta ei reverentia, stans, detecto capite,
petit Reginam benedici, et coronari, sub his verbis:

REverendissime Pater, postulamus, ut Consortem nostram nobis a Deo conjunctam
benedicere, and corom Reginali decorare dignemini, ad laudem and gloriam
Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi.

Deinde ad solium suum revertitur.

Tunc Regina, quae in aliquo loco ad partem in Ec^lesia a principio steterat, a
duolus Episcopis paratis, non his qui Regem deduxerunt, sed primis post eos,
crine soluto, and capit^ velato, in vestibus suis communibus ad Metropolitanum
ante altar deducitur; and facta Metropolitano reverentia, coram illo gen^ctit,
and ejus manum osculatur.

Tunc surgit Metropolitanus cum mitra, and infaldistorio procumbit. Regina vero
ad ejus sinistram in terram se prosternit; and inchoantur ac perficiuntur
Litaniae, ut supra: quibus finitis, Metropolitanus, deposita mitra, surgit, and
stans versus ad illam ante se genuflexam, dicit sequentem Orationem
intelligibili voce; quam etiam, and alia sequentia, astantes Praelati parati
submissa voce dicunt.

Oremus.
OMnipotens sempiterne Deus, hanc famulam tuam N. coelesti benedictione
sanctifica, quam in adjutorium Regni Reginam eligimus; tua ubique sapientia
doceat, and comfortet, atque Ecclesia t^a fidelem famulam semper agnoscat. Per
eundem Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat
in unitate Spiritus sancti Deus.

Deinde, extensis manibus ante pectus, dicit:

Per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. V. Dominus vobi^cum. R. Et cum Spiritu
tuo. V. Sursum corda. R. Habemus ad Dominum. V. Gratias agamus Domino Deo
nostro. R. Dignum and justum est. Vere dignum and justum est, aequum and
salutare, nos tibi semper and ubique gratias agere. Domine sancte, Pater
omnipoten^, aeterne Deus: Honorum cunctorum auctor ac dist^butor,
benedictionumque omni^m largus infu^or, t^ibue super hanc famulam tuam Re^inam
benedictionis (...) copiam; and quam humana electio sibi praeesse gaudet, tua
(...) electioni^ and benedictionis in^sio accumulet. Concede ei, Domine,
auctoritatem regiminis, consilii magnitudinem, sapientiae, prudentiae, and
intellectus abundantiam, religionis ac pietatis custodiam; quate^s mereatur
benedici and augmenta^i in nomine, ut Sa^a; (...) and faecunda^i, ut Rebecca;
contra omnium (...) vitiorum monstra, ut Judith; in regimine Regni eligi, ut
Esther. U^, quam humana nititur fragilitas benedice^e, coelestis potius intimi
roris repleat infusio. Et q^ae a nobis eligitur and benedicitur in Reginam, a
te mereatur obtinere praemium aeternitatis perpetuae. Et sicut ab hominibus
sublimatur in nomine, ita a te sublimetur fide and operatione. Illo etiam
sapientiae tuae eam ro^e perfunde, quem beatus David in repromissine and filius
ejus Solomon percepit in locupletatione. Sis ei, Domine, contra cunctorum ictus
inimicorum lorica; in adversis galea; in prosperis sa pientia; in protectione
clypeus sempiternus. Sequatur pacem, diligat charitatem, abstineat se ab omni
impietate; loquatur justitiam, custodiat veritatem; sit c^ltrix justitiae et
pietatis, amatrix religionis. Vigeatque praesenti benedictione in hoc aevo
annis plurimis, and in sempiterno sine fine aeternis.

Quod sequitur, dicit plane legendo; ita famen, quod a circumstantibus audiatur.

Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in
unitate Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

Qua Praefatione exple^a, se^et Metropolitanus; et accepta mitra, inungit in
modum Crucis cum oleo Catechuminorum illius brachium dexterum, inter juncturam
manus, et juncturam cubi^, atque inter scapulas, ^cens:

DEus Pater aetern^ gloriae sit tibi adjutor, and Omnipotens benedicat tibi,
preces tuas exaudiat; vitam tuam longitudine dierum adimpleat; benedictionem
tuam jugiter confirmet; te cum omni populo in aeternum conservet; inimicos tuos
confufione induat; et super te Christi sanctificatio, atque hujus olei infusio
floreat: ut, qui tibi in terris tribuit benedictionem, ipse in coelis conferat
meritum Angelorum; ac benedicat te, et custodiat in vitam aeternam Jesus
Christus Dominus noster, qui vivit and regnat Deus, in saecula saeculorum. R.
Amen.

Quo facto, surgit Regina, et a suis ducitur ad sacristiam, seu papilionem, ubi
Rex Regales vestes indutus est; ibi et ipsa induitur vestibus Reginalibus,
quibus induta reducitur ad Metropolitanum adhuc cum mitra in faldistorio
sedentem, qui imponit illi ante genu^exae coronam, dicens:

ACcipe Coronam gloriae, ut scias te esse consortem Regni, populoque Dei semper
prospere consulas; et quanto plus exaltaris, tanto amplius humilitatem diligas,
et custodias, in Christo Jesu Domino nostro.

Et mox dat ei sceptrum, dicens:

ACcipe virgam virtutis ac veritatis, et esto pauperibus misericors, et
affabilis; viduis, pupillis, and orphanis, diligentissimam curam exhibeas; ut
omnipotens Deus augeat tibi gratiam suam, qui vivit et regnat in saecula
saeculorum. R. Amen.

Quo facto, surgit Regina; and Episcopi parati, qui ipsam ad altar deduxerunt,
eam associant usque ad suum thalamum, ubi sedet in solio suo, matronis ejus
ipsam comitantibus: deinde dicitur Alleluia, sive ultimu^ versus Tractus, vel
Sequentiae, Evangelium, and ^ffertorium. Quo dicto, R gina cum Rege a suis
tantum ^ssociati, vadunt ad ^fferendum Metropolitano in faldistorio ante medium
altaris sedenti, de auro quantum volunt, and manum Metropolitani recipientis
osculantur: deinde revertuutur ambo ad thalamum suum, et proceditur in Missae
usque ad Communionem. Data pace Regi et Reginae per primum ex Praelatis
paratis, cum instrumento ad hoc ordinato; Rex et Regina a suis tantum associati
descendunt de thalamis, et veniunt ad altar, ubi in supremo gradu
genuflectunt: et percepta Communione, Metropolitanus ponit ambas hostias
consecratas super patenam, et conversus ad Regem et Reginam, eos communicate.

Rex, priusquam Communionem sumat, osculatur manum dexter am Metropolitani; cum
simili modo communicate Reginam, quae similiter ejus manum osculatur: et
successive ambos ex calice suo purificat; qui purificati ad thalamos suos
revertuntur, eo ordine quo venerunt. M^tropolitanus vero ablutionem s^mit; et
accepta mitra, lavat manus, perficitque Missam, et in fine dat Benedictionem
solemnem. Qua data Rex et Regina vadunt ad palatium suum; et Metropolitanus
atque alii Pr^lati omnes deponunt vestes sacras, et ad propria quisque
revertitur.

De Benedicione et Cor^natione Reginae s^lius.
SI Rege ^am pridem coronato, Regina sola, ut Conjux illius, coronanda sit
parantur duo thalami, et a^ius locus, in quo Regina a principio Officii usque
ad tempus corona^tonis expecta^. Uocantur omnes Praelati Regni, atque omnia
alia fiunt, quae supra pro coronatione Reg sordinata sunt. Die autem statuto,
Metropolitano et Praelatis in Ecclesia constitutis, et se vestientibus, Rex
vestibus Regalibus indutus cum corona in capite, et sceptro in manu, ense
praecedente, a suis associatus venit ad Ecclesiam, et ascendit thalamum suum;
et Metropolitano ac Praelatis omnibus paratis, incipitur Missa, more solito, et
continuatur usque ad Alleluia, sive ultimum versum Tractus, vel Sequentiae,
exclusive. Tunc Rex coronam et sceptrum ferens descendit de thalamo suo; et
Metropolitano in faldistorio ante altar cum mitra sedente, stans, detecto
capite, petit ab eo Reginam benedici, et coronari, sub his verbis:

REverendissime Pater, postulamus ut consortem nostram nobis a Deo conjunctam
benedice^e, et corona Reginali decorare dignemini, ad laudem et gloriam
Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi.

Deinde ad thalamum suum revertitur: et Regina, quae usque tunc in aliquo loco
ad partem in Ecclesia steterat, a duobus Prioribus Praelatis paratis, crine
soluto, et capite velato, ducitur ad Metropolitanum ante altar sedentem; et
facta ei reverentia coram eo genuflectit, et ejus manum osculatur. Tunc surgit
Metropolitanus, et cum mitra procumbit supra faldistorium. Regina vero ad ejus
sinistram se in terram prosternit, et inchoantur Litaniae, et perficiuntur,
atque omnia alia fiunt, quae supra in coronatione Reginae dicta sunt, usque ad
Offertorium; ad quod poterit Rex cum Regina procedere, vel Regina sola, prout
Regi placebit. Facta Communione per Metropolitanum, communicatur Regina. Deinde
perficitur Missa, et in fine Metropolitanus dat Benedictionem solemnem, etc.

De Benedictione et Coronatione Reginae ut Regni Dominae.
SI vero Regina coronanda est ut Regni Domina, et absque Rege, tunc paratur
thalamus unus in Ecclesia; vocantur Praelati Regni, et omnia alia similiter
fiunt, quae supra pro coronatione Regis ordinata sunt. Die statuto, convenient
in Ecclesia, in qua coronatio fieri debet; ubi Metropolitanus, aut alius ad
quem spectat, cum Episcopis aliis parat se, et sedent ante al^are, ut supra
dictum est. Interim Regina consuetis vestibus induta, cum suis Praelatis,
Baronibus, et Matronis, atque aliis domesticis venit ad Ecclesiam; et cum
fuerit prope Presbyterium, duo priores Episcopi parati v^niunt ei (...), et cum
mitris capi a ilii aliquantu^um inclinantes, ipsam inter se mediam usque ad
Metropolitanum deducunt: cui Regina caput inclinans, ^umilem reverentiam
exhibet; qua facta, prior ipsorum deducentium detecto capi^, versus ad
Metropolitanum, dicit:

REverendissime Pater, postulat sancta Matter Ecclesia Catholica, ut praesentem
circumspectam mulierem ad dignitatem Reginalem sublevetis.

Tunc interrogat Me^ropolanus:

Scitis illam esse dignam and utilem ad hanc dignitatem?

Ille respendet:

Et novimus, and credimus eam esse dignam, and utilem Ecclesiae Dei, et ad
Regimen hujus Regni.

Metropolitanus dicit:

Deo gratias.

Tunc sedet Regina media inter ipsos Episcopos deducentes congruenti spatio a
Metropolitano, ita ut illi faciem vertat; ipsi etiam deducentes Episcopi,
senior ad dexteram, alius ad sinistram Reginae se collocant, ut et ipsi ad
alteru^rum fac^s vertant. Ipsis sic sedentibus, postquam aliquantulum
quieverint, Metropolitanus coronandam Reg^am admonet, dicens:

CUm hodie per manus nostras, circumspecta mulier, qui Christi salvatoris
nostri vice in hac re fungimur (qua^vis indigni sacram unctionem et Regni
insignia sis suscepturus; been est, ut te prius de onere, ad quod de^inaris,
moneamus. Regiam hodie suscipis dignitatem, et regendi sideles populos tibi
commissos curam sumis. P^aeclarum sane inter mortales locum, sed discriminis,
laboris, atque anxietatis plenum. Verum, si consideraveris, quod omnis potestas
a Domino Deo est, per quem Reges regnant, et legum conditores justa decernunt,
tu quoque de grege tibi commisso ipsi Deo rationem es redditura. Primum,
pietatem servabis, Dominum Deum tuum tota mente ac puro cord coals.
Christianam religionem, ac fidem catholicam, quam ab incunabuli^ professa es,
ad finem usque inviolatam retinebis, eamque contra omnes adversantes pro
viribus defendes. Ecclesiarum Praelatis, ac reliquis Sacerdotibus condignam
reverentiam exhibebis. Ecclesiasticam libertatem non conculcabis; Justitiam,
fine qua nulla societas diu consistere potest, erga omnes inconcusse
administrabis, bonis praemia, noxiis debitas poenas retribuendo. Viduas,
pupillos, pauperes, ac debiles ab omni oppressione defendes. Omnibus te
adeuntibus benignam, mansuctam, atque affabilem, pro Regia tua dignitate te
praebebis. Et ita te geres, ut non ad tuam, sed totius populi utilitatem
regnare, praemiumque been factorum tuorum, non in terris, sed in eoelo
expectare videaris. Quod ipse praestare dignetur, qui vivit et regnat Deus, in
saecula saeculorum. Resp. Amen.

Regina electa accedit ad Metropolitanum; et ge^flexa facit hanc professionem,
dicens:

EGo N. deo annuente futura Regina N. profiteor, et promitto coram Deo, et
Angelis ejus, deinceps legem, justitiam and pacem Ecclefiae Dei, populoque mihi
subjecto, pro posse and nosse, facere ac servare, salvo condigno misericordiae
Dei respectu, sicut in consilio fidelium meorum melius potero invenire.
Pontisicibus quoque Ecclesiarum Dei condignum and canonicum honorem exhibere;
atque ea, quae ab Imperatoribus and Regibus Ecclesiis collata and reddita sunt,
inviolabiliter observare. Abbatibus, Comitibus, and vasallis meis congruum
honorem, secundum consilium fidelium meorum, p^aestare.

Deinde ambabus manibus fangit librum Evangeliorum, (quem Metropolitanus coram
ea super genibus aper^um tenet, inferiori part libri Reginae versa) ^icens,

Sic me Deus adjuvet, and haec sancta Dei Evangelia.

Et post Regina electa Metropolitani manum reverenter osculatur. Quo facto,
M^tropolitanus surgit, et cum mitra procumbit in faldistorio. Regina vero ad
ejus sinistram in terram se prosternit. Et cantores incipiunt, schola
prosequente, Litanias; in quibus cum dictum f^erit,

Ut omnibus fidelibus, etc.

R. Te rogamus audi nos.

Metropolitanus surgit, et accepto baculo pastorali in sinistra, super illam
dicit:

Ut hanc electam in Reginam coronandam ^enedicere digneris.

R. Te rogamus audi nos.

Secundo dicit.

Ut hanc electam in Reginam coronandam benedicere, and consecrare digneris.

R. Te rogamus andi nos.

Producendo semper super Reginam signum Crucis. Idem dicunt et faciunt Episcopi
parati, genuf^exi tamen permanentes. Quo dicto, Metropolitanus redit ad
accubitum, cantoribus Litanias resumentibus, et perficientibus. Quibus finitis,
Metropolitanus, deposita mitra, surgit, Regina prostrata manente, et dicit
super eam intelligibili voce Orationem sequentem; quam astantes Episcopi, etiam
sine mitris in locis suis stantes, submissa voce pronunciant.

Oremus.
OMnipotens sempiterne Deus, hanc famulam tuam coelesti benedictone sanctifica,
quam in gubernationem Regni Reginam eligimus; tua ubique sapientia doceat, et
confortet, atque Ecclesia tua fidelem famulam semper agnoscat. Per eundem
Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in
unitate Spiritus sancti Deus.

Tunc surgit Regina et coram Pontifice genu^ectif. Deinde Pontifex mediocri
voce, extensis manibus ante pectus, dicit:

Per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. V. Dominus vobiscum. R. Et cum Spiritu
tuo. V. Sursum corda. R. Habemus ad Dominum. V. Gratias agamus Domino Deo
nostro. R. Dignum and justum est. Vere dignum and justum est, aequum and
salutare, nos tibi semper and ubique gratias agere, Domine sancte, Pater
omnipotens, aeterne Deus: Honorum cunctorum auctor ac distributor,
benedictionumque omnium largus infusor, tribue super hanc famulam tuam Reginam
benedictionis tuae copiam; and quam humana electio sibi praeesse gaudet, tua
supernae electionis and benedictionis infusio accumulet. Concede ei, Domine,
auctoritatem regiminis, consilii magnitudinem, sapientiae, prudentiae, and
intellectus abundantiam, religionis ac pietatis custodiam; quatenus mereatur
benedici and augmentari in nomine, ut Sara; visita ri and faecundari, ut
Rebecca; contra omnium muniri vitiorum monstra, ut Judith; in regimine Regni
eligi, ut Esther. Uc, quam humana nititur fragilitas benedicere, coelestis
potius intimi roris repleat infusio. Et quae a nobis eligitur and benedicitur
in Reginam, a te mereatur obtinere praemium aeternitatis perpetuae. Et sicut ab
hominibus sublimatur in nomine, ita a te sublimetur fide and operatione. Illo
etiam sapientiae tuae eam rore perfunde, quem beatus David in repromissine and
filius ejus Solomon percepit in locupletatione. Sis ei, Domine, contra
cunctorum ictus inimicorum lorica; in adversis galea; in prosperis sapientia;
in protectione clypeus sempiternus. Sequatur pacem, diligat charitatem,
abstineat se ab omni impietate; loquatur justitiam, custodiat veritatem; sit
cultrix justitiae et pietatis, amatrix religionis. Vigeatque praesenti
benedictione in hoc aevo annis plurimis, and in sempiterno sine fine aeternis.

Deinde dicit plane legendo; ita tamen, quod a circumstantibus audiatur.

Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in
unitate Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

Quibus dictis, sedet Metropolitanus; et accepta mitra, intingit pollic^m
dexterae manus in oleum Catechumenorum; et inungit, in modum Cruc^s, brachium
dexterum Reginae inter juncturam manus, et inter juncturam cubiti, atque inter
scapulas, dicens.

DEus Pater aeternae gloriae sit tibi adjutor, and Omnipotens benedicat tibi,
preces tuas exaudiat; vitam tuam longitudine dierum adimpleat; benedictionem
tuam jugiter confirmet; te cum omni populo in aeternum conservet; inimicos tuos
confusione induat; et super te Christi sanctificatio, atque hujus olei infusio
floreat: ut, qui tibi in terris tribuit benedictionem, ipse in coelis conferat
meritum Angelorum; ac benedicat te, et custodiat in vitam aeternam Jesus
Christus Dominus noster, qui vivit and regnat Deus, in saecula saeculorum. R.
Amen.

Quo facto, surgit Regina, et ad part^m se retrahit ubi Praelati sui Domestici
ci assisiunt. Metropolitanus vero lavat et abstergit manus, deinde accedit ante
altar; et deposita mitra, cum suis ministris facit Confessionem. Idem faciunt
Episcopi parati juxta seeds suas sine mitris stantes. Facta Confessione,
Metropolitanus ascendit ad altar, osculatur, incensat, et procedit in Missa
usque ad Allelujah exclusive, sive ultimum versum Tractus, vel Sequentiae, si
dicitur, more consueto. Regina vero ducitur a suis ad sacristiam, vel
papillionem, ubi accipit vestes Reginales. Deinde redit cum illis ad thalamum,
ubi manet usque ad dictum Graduale; non tamen sedet in so^fo, sed super al^qued
scabellum sibi paratum genuflexa procumbit audiens Missam. Missa dicitur de
die; et cum Dratione diei, dicitur pro ipsa el^cta Regina sub uno, Per Dominum.

Oration.
QUaesumus, Omnipotens Deus, ut famula tua N. Regina nostra, qui tua
miseratione suseepit Regni gubernacula, virtutum etiam omnium percipiat
incrementa; quibus decenter ornata, et vitiorum monstra devitare, et ad te, qui
via, veritas, and vita es, gratiosa valeat perveni^e. Per Dominum nostrum Jesum
Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in unitate Spitus sancti Deus,
per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

Graduali cantato, Metropolitanus sedet ante altar in faldistorio cum mitra,
et Regina a suis associata media in^er priores duos Praelatos paratos ad
Metropolitanum reducitur; cui facta reverentia, ut prius, genuflectit coram eo.
Tunc imponitur ^i Corona, quamomnes Episcopi parati, qui adsunt, de altari per
Metrolitanum sumptam manibus tenent, ipso Metropolitano illam regente, et
capiti illius imponente, ac dicente:

A Ccipe Coronam Regni, quae, licet ab indignis, Episcoporum tamen manibus
capiti tuo imponitur. In nomine Patris, and Filii, and Spiritus sancti, quam
sanctitatis gloriam, et honorem, and opus fortitudinis, significare intelligas;
and per hanc te participem Ministerii nostri non ignores. Ita, ut sicut nos in
interioribus pastores rectoresque animarum intelligimur, ita and tu in
exterioribus vera Dei cultrix, strenuaque contra omnes adversitates Ecclesiae
Christi defensatrix assistas, regnique tibi a Deo dati, and per officium
nostrae benedictionis in vice Apostolorum, omniumque Sanctorum, regimini tuo
commissi utilis executrix, proficuaque regnatrix semper appareas; ut inter
gloriosos athletas, virtutum gemmis ornata, and praemio sempiternae felicitatis
coronata, cum Redemptore ac Salvatore nostro Jesu Christo, cujus nomen vicemque
ges^are crederis, sine fine glorieris. Qui vivit et imperat Deus, cum Patre and
Spiritu sancto, in saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

Et mox dat e^ Sceptrum in manum, dicens:

A Ccipe virgam virtutis ac veritatis, et esto pauperibus misericors, et
affabilis; viduis, pupillis, et orphanis, diligentissimam curam exhibeas; ut
Omnipotens Deus augeat tibi gratiam suam, qui vivit et regnat in saecula
saeculorum. R. Amen.

Tunc surgunt omnes, et Metropolitanus cum omnibus Episcopis paratis deducit
Reginam, coronam in capite et sceptrum in manu ferentem, mediam inter se et
digniorem Episcopum paratum, supra solium; ubi stans cum mitra, una cum eodem
digniore Episcopo, inthroniza^ eam in solio, dicens.

STa, et retine amodo locum tibi a Deo delegatum, per auctoritatem omnipotentis
Dei, et per praesentem traditionem nostram, omnium scilicet Episcoporum,
caeterorumque Dei servorum; et quanto Clerum sacris altaribus propinquiorem
perspi^is, tanto ei potiorem in locis congruis honorem impendere memineris;
quatenus mediator Dei and hominum te mediatricem Cleri et plebis permanere
faciat.

Deinde Metropolitanus, deposita mitra, inchoat, schola sequente, Hymnum:

Te Deum laudamus.

Qui totus dicitur: quo incepto, Metropolitanus accedit ad dextram Reginae: ibi
continuo manens, usque ad finem Hymni; finito hymno, Metropolitanus stans, ut
prius, juxta Reginam sine mitra, dicit super illam:

V. Firmetur manus tua, et exaltetur dextera tua.

R. Justitia et judicium praeparatio sedis tuae.

V. Domine exaudi orationem meam.

R. Et clamor meus ad te veniat.

V. Dominus vobiscum.

R. Et cum Spiritu tuo.

Oremus.
DEus, qui victrices Moysi manus in oratione firmasti, qui quamvis aetate
languesceret, infatigabili sanctitate pugnabat; ut dum Amalech iniquus
vincitur, dum profanus natio^um populus subjugatur, exterminatis alienigenis,
hereditati tuae poss^ssio copiosa servi^et; opus manuum tuarum pia nostrae
orationis exauditione confirma: habemus and nos apud te, sancte Pater, Dominum
salvatorem, qui pro nobis manus suas extendit in cru^; per quem etiam precamur,
Altissime, ut, tua potentia s^ffragante univer orum hostium frangatur impietas;
pop^e (...), ^ssante formidine, te solum timere condiscat. Per eundem Chri^m
Dominum nostrum. R. Amen.

Quibus ^itis, Me^ropolitanus cum Episcopis paratis revertitur ad sedem suam,
vel faldistorium prope altar, et dicitur Alleluia, sive ultimus versus
Tractus, vel Sequentiae Eva^lium, et alia usque ad Offertorium inclusive. Quo
victo, Metropolitanus residet in faldistorio ante medium altaris cum mitra; et
Regina a suis Praelatis, Magnatibus, et aliis a^ciata venit ante
Metropolitanum, coram quo genuflexa, offert ei aurum, quantum sibi placet, et
manum Metropolitani recipientis osculatur. Deinde ad solium suum reveriitur.
Metropolitanus lavat manus, surgit, et accedit ad altar, et prosequitur Missam
usque ad Communionem.

Cum Secreta dici dicitur pro Regina, sub uno Per Dominum.

Secreta.
MUnera, quaesumus Domine, oblata sanctifica: ut et nobis Unigeniti tui Corpus
et Sanguis fiant; et Reginae nostrae ad obtinendam animae corporisque salu^em,
et ad peragendum injunctum officium, te largiente, usquequaque proficiant. Per
eundem Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in
unitate Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

Pax datur Reginae per primum ex Praelatis paratis, cum instrumento ad hoc
ordinato. Postquam Metropolitanus se communicaverit de Corpore, et Sanguine;
Regina sine corona, et sine sceptro, de thalamo suo, a suis duntaxat associata,
accedit ad altar, genuflectit in supremo gradu altaris, et Metropolitanus
conversus ad Reginam eam communicate. Regina, antequam sumat Sacramentum,
osculatur manum dexteram Metropolitani; et sumpta Communione, ex calice de manu
Metropolitani se purificat, et purificatus ad thalamum suum revertitur cum
suis, ut venit. Metropolitanus vero ablutionem sumit; et accepta mitra, lavat
manus, et perficit Missam.

Cum Postcommunione diei, dicitur pro Reglna sub uno Per Dominum.

Postcommunio.
HAee, Domine, oblatio salutaris famulam tuam N. Reginam nostram ab omnibus
tueatur adversis; quatenus Ecclesiasticae pacis obtineat tranquillitatem, and
post istius temporis decursum ad aeternam perveniat haereditatem. Per Dominum
nostrum Jesum Christum filium tuum, qui tecum vivit and regnat in unitate
Spiritus sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.

In fine Metropolitanus dat Benedictionem solemnem, qua data, omnes vadunt in
pace.

De Benedictione and Coronatione Regis in Consortem electi.
CUm autem Regina, jampridem, ut Regni Domina benedicta et coronata, deinde
Consortem sibi elegerit, quem postea statuerit coronari, ad diem ordinatam
vocantur omnes Praelati Regni; parantur duo thalami, atque omnia alia
ordinantur, prout supra in coronatione Regis posita sunt, f. 163. Die autem
statuto, Metropolitano et Praelatis in Ecclesia constitutis, et se
vestientibus, Regina Reginalibus vestibus induta, cum corona in capite et
sceptro in manu, a suis associata venit ad Ecclesiam, et ascendit thalamum
suum. Illis autem paratis, et suo ordine sedentibus, ut supra in coronatione
Regis ordinatum est; Regina de thalamo suo discentens cum corona in capite, et
sceptro in manu, venit coram Metropolitano, a quo, facta ei reverentia, petit
Regem consor^em suum benedici et coronari, sub his verbis:

REverendissime Pater, postulamus ut consortem nostram nobis a Deo conjunctam
benedicere, et corona Reginali decorare dignemini, ad laudem et gloriam
Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi.

Deinde ad thalamum suum revertitur. Interim Rex vestibus militaribus (...)

aliquantulum inclinantes, ipsum, bireto deposito, usque ante Metropolitanum
deducunt; coram quo Rex caput inclinans, humilem ei reverentiam exhibet. Dua
facta, prior Episcoporum deducentium stans, detecto capite, versus ad
Metropolitanum, vo^e intelligibili dicit:

REvereudissime Pater, postulat sancta Matter Ecclesia Catholica, ut praesentem
egregium militem ad dignitatem Regiam sublevetis.

Et omnia alia suo ordine fiunt, prout habetur supra sub prima rubrica de
benedictione et coronatione Regis, fol. 163. usque ad aliam rudricam de
coronatione Reginae, fol. 174. quae hic omittitur, cum sit prius coronata.

These forms of Prayers and Ceremonies are used in most foreign Kingdoms, as
Spain, Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, etc. with some little variation relating only
to their particular Kingdoms.

M. Paulus Stranskie Reipub. Bohemiae, Lugd. Bat. 1634. c. 5. sect. 12, to 20.
p. 572, etc. describing at large the manner of the Coronation of the Kings of
Bohemia in later times, informs us, That after the Supreme Burgrave of Prague
has in the name of the most blessed and undivided Trinity pronounced such a
one to be elected and accepted King of Bohemia, all the multitude hearing this,
presently cry out, ^vat, vivat, vivat N. Bohemiae Rex: After which h^ving taken
his Oath, the Archbishop and Bishops use several set Prayers for him; and all
the People, as well those who are present as absent at the Coronation feast,
cry out with ingeminated joyful shouts, Uivat, vivat, vivat, Triumphatis
Reipublicae Hostibus N. Bohemiae Rex.

Seldens Titles of Honor, p. 222. to 25. 5.
In France they have a particular Pontifical or form of Prayers, Benedictions
and Ceremonies used at the Consecration of their Kings, written and used in the
year 1365. the first year of Charles the 5th. King of France, by his special
command, and thus subscribed.

Ce liver du ^acre des Roys de France est a nous Charles le v. de nostre nom
Roy de France; and le fimes corriger, ordeiner, eserier and istorier l'an 1365.

Ammonitio ad Regem dicendo ita.
A vobis perdonari petimus ut unicuique de Nobis and Ecclesiis nobis commissis,
Canonicum privilegium, ac debitam legem atque justitiam conservetis, and
defensionem exhibeatis, sicnt Rex in regno suo debet unicuique Episcopo, and
Ecclesiae sibi com^issae.

Responsio Regis ad Episcopos.
Promitto vobis and perdono, ( Quod. Bochellu.
) quia unicuique de vobis, et Ecclesiis vobis commissis, Canonicum privilegium,
et debitam legem atque justitiam ( Servabo Bochellus.
) conservabo, et defensionem quantum potuero exhibebo Domino adjuvante, sicut
Rex in suo regno unicuique Episcopo, et Ecclesiae sibi commissae per rectum
exhibere debet.

Item haec dicit Rex, and promittit and firmat Juramento.
Haec Populo Christiano et mihi subdito, in Christi nomine, The Oath of the
French King. See Bodin. de Repub. l. 1. c. 8.
promitto, In primis ut Ecclesiae Dei omnis populus Christianus veram pacem

et omnes iniquitates omnibus gradibus, interdicam. Item, ut in omnibus judiciis
aequitatem et misericordiam praecipiam, ut mihi et vobis indulge at per suam
misericordiam clemens, et misericors Dominus. Item, de terra mea ac
Jurisdiction mihi subdita universos haereticos ab Ecclesia denotatos pro
viribus bona fide exterminare studebo. Haec omnia praedicta firmo juramento.

Tunc manum apponat libro, and librum osculetur. His factis ( Promissionibus.

Sed secundum usum Romanum, and aliquorum regnorum non dicitur, Te Deum, usque

apertas profundius ante and retro in pectore videlicet and inter scapulas (

Deus inenarrabilis Auctor mundi. Conditor generis humani, Gubernator Imperii,
Confirmator regni, qui ex utero fidelis amici tui Patriarchae nostri Abrahae
praeelegisti Regem saeculis profuturum, Tu praesentem Regem hunc N. cum
exercitu suo per intercessionem omnium Sanctorum, uberi benedictione locupleta,
et in solium regnifirma stabilitate ( Connecte Bochellus.

agro, Samuelem in templo. Et illa eum benedictione siderea ac sapientiae tuae
rore perfunde, quam beatus David in Psalterio, Solomon fili^ ejus, te
remunerante, percepit e coelo.

Sis ei contra acies inimicorum lorica, in adversis galea, in prosperis
patientia, in protectione clypeus sempiternus. Et praesta ut gentes illi
teneant fidem, Proceres sui habeant pacem, diligant caritatem, a^stineant se a
cupiditate, loquantur justitiam, custodiant veritatem. Et it a populus iste
pullulet coalitus benedictione aeternitatis, ut semper maneant tripudiantes in
pace victores. Quod ipse praestare, ( Praestare dignetur, qui tecum and cum
Spiritu Sancto sine fine permanet in saecula saeculorum, Amen. Bochell.

omnium frugum opulentiam, ex largitate divini muneris longa per tempora, ut
illo regnante sit sanitas corporum in patria, and pax inviolata sit in regno,
et dignitas gloriosa regalis palatii maximo splendore regiae potestatis oculis
omnium fulgeat, luce clarissima ( Coruscante atque Bochellus.
) choruscare atque splendere, quasi splendidissima fulgura maximo perfusa
lumine vid^tur. Tribue ei Omnipotens Deus ut sit fortissimus Protector Patriae,
and Consolator Ecclesiarum atque Coenobiorum Sanctorum maxima cum pietate
regalis munificentiae, atque ut sit fortissimus regum, Triumphator hostium ad
opprimendas rebels and ( Paganorum, Idem.
) Paganas nationes. Sitque suis inimicis satis terribilis prae maxima
fortitudine regalis potentiae, Optimatibus quoque atque praecelsis proceribus
ac fidelibus sui regni sit munificus, and amabilis, and pius, ut ab omnibus
timeatur atque diligatur. Reges quoque de lumbis ejus per successiones temporum
futurorum egrediantur, regnum hoc regere totum. Et post gloriosa tempora atque
faelicia praesentis vitae, gaudia sempiterna in perpetua beatitudine habere
mereatur. Quod ipse praestare ( Digneris qui cum unigenito filio tuo, etc.

Alia Benedictio.
Benedic Domine quaesumus hunc Principem nostrum quem ad salutem populi Nobis a
te credimus esse concessum, fac eum esse annis multiplicem, vigenti atque
salubri corporis robore vigentem, and ad senectutem optatam, atque demum ad
finem pervenire faelicem. Sit nobis fiducia eam obtinere gratiam pro populo
quam Aaron in tabernaculo, Helyseus in fluvio, Ezechias in lectulo, Zacharias
vetulus impetravit in templo; sit illi regendi virtus atque auctoritas, qualem
Josue suscepit in castris, Gedeon sumpsit in praeliis, Petrus accepit in clave,
Paulus est usus in dogmate. Et ita Pastorum cura tuum proficiat in ovile, sicut
Isaac profecit in fruge te, Jacob dilatatus est in grege. Quod ipse (

what had ever any of the French Kings to do with these people? but the wonder
is most strange, that this place of the Prayer (which might have been sit ed
for any King) is thus left here. In Bochellus, Nordam, Cimbrorum, is for
Nordanchimbrorum, which should have been doubtless Nordhanhumbrorum, for those
beyond Humber, And it is plain, that the ^ery Syllables of the Saxon Ceremonial
are a^terwards used in this of the ^rench.

Postcommunio.
Haec Domine Oration salutaris fam^lum tuum N. Regem nostrum ab omnibus tueatur

illius temporis decursum ad aernam perveniat haereditatem. Per Dominum, etc.

Quando legitur Evangelium, Rex, and Regina debent deponere Coronas suas.
Notandum, quod lecto Evangelio, major inter Archiepiscopos and Episcopos
accipit librum Evangelii, and defert Domino Regi ad deosculandum, and postea
Reginae, and postea Domino Archiepiscopo Missam celebranti. Post offertorium
Pares deducunt Regem ad altar, Coronam ejus sustinentes. Rex autem debet
offerre panem unum. Vinum in urceo argenteo. Tresdecem Bisantos aureos, and
Regina similiter. In eundo autem and redeundo Gladius nudus defertur coram eo.
Finita Missa iter^m Pares adducunt Regem coram altari, and communicate corpus
and sanguinem Domini, de manu Domini Archiepiscopi Missam celebrantis. Sed
notandum est, quod ille qui dedit ei Evangelium ad deosculandum debet post Pax
Domini, accipere pacem ab Archiepiscopo Missam celebrante and defer Regi cum
oris osculo, and Reginae ( Cum libro. Bochellus.
) in libro. Et post eum omnes Archiepiscopi, and Episcopi, unus post alium,
dant osculum pacis Regi in suo solio residenti. Missa finita deponit
Archiepiscopus Coronam de capite Regis, and expoliato Rege de insignioribus
vestimentis, and aliis indutis, iterum imponit capiti suo Archiepiscopus aliam
Coronam minorem, and sic vadit ad palatium nudo Gladio praecedente. Et
sciendum, quod ejus Camisia propter Sanctam unctionem debet comburi.

De Ampullae reductione.
Sciendum, quod Rex debet recipere de Baronibus suis Nobilioribus and
fortioribus in die Coronationis suae in aurora diei ( Di^i and mittere. etc.
Boch.
) mittere apud sanctum Remigium pro sancta Ampulla, and illi debent jurare
Abbati and Ecclesiae, quod dictam sanctam Ampullam bona fide ducent and
reducent ad sanctam Ecclesiam beati Remigii. Abbas autem hoc facto, debet
sanctam Ampullam afferre sicut superius est notatum. Finita consecratione and
missa, debent iterum iidem Barons reducere sanctam Ampullam usque ad sanctum
Remigium honorifice and secure, and eam restituere loco suo. ( Thus far also
that in Bochellus. And here it is concluded with Explicit consecratio ^
Coronatio Regis Franciae. But he has not the Ceremonial for the Queens
Coronation Which here follows.
)

Ordo ad Reginam benedicendam.
Quae debet consecrari statim post factam consecrationem The Coronation of the
French Queen.
Regis, debet ei parari solium in modum solii Regis. Debet tamen aliquantulum
minus esse. Debet autem Regina adduci a duobus Episcopis in Ecclesiam, and Rex
in suo solio sedere, in omnibus ornamentis suis regiis si^ut in solio residebat
post Inunctionem, and Coronationem suam superius annotatam. Regina autem
adducta in Ecclesiam debet prosterni ante altar, and prostrata debet orare,
qua elevata ab oratione ab Episcopis, debet iterum caput inclinare, and
Archiepiscopus hanc Orationem dicere.

ORATION.
Adesto Domine supplicationibus nostris, et quod humilitatis nostrae gerendum
est mysterio tuae virtutis impleatur effectu. Per Dom. etc.

Deinde dicat Archiepiscopus hanc Orationem.
Omnipotens aeterne Deus fons and origo totius bonitatis, qui foeminei sexus
fragilitatem nequaquam reprobando, potius adversaris, sed dignanter
comprobando, potius eligis. Et qui infirma mundi eligendo, fortia quaeque
confundere decrevisti: quique etiam gloriae virtutisque tuae triumphum in manu
Judith foeminae, olim Judaicae plebi de host saevissimo designare voluisti:
respice quaesumus ad preces humilitatis nostiae. Et super hanc famulamtuam N.
quam supplici devotione in Reginam eligimus, benedictionum tuarum dona
multiplica. ^amque dextera ^uae potentiae semper and ubique circunda, si^que
bono muniminis tui undique firmiter protecta, quat^nus visibilis, seu
invisibilis hostis nequitias triumpha^er expugnare valeat. ^t una cum Sara
atque Retecca, Lya et Rachel, beatis reverendisque foeminabus, fructu uteri sui
faecundari seu gratulari mereatur, ad totius decorem regni, statumque sanctae
Dei Ecclesiae regendum, necnon protegendum. Per Christum Dominum nostrum, Qui
ex intemerato beatae Mariae Virginis alvo na^ci, visitare, ac renovare dignatus
est mundum: Q^i tecum vivit, etc.

Alia Oration.
Deus qui solus habes immortalitatem, lucemque inhabitas inaccessibilem, cujus
providentia in sui dispositione non fallitur, quifecisti quae futura sunt, et
vocas ea quae non sunt, qui suberbos aequo mode^amine de principatu dejicis,
atque humiles in sublime dignanter provehis, Ineffabilem misericordiam tuam
supplices exoramus, ut sicut Hester Reginam, Israelis causa salutis de
captivitatis s^ae compede solutam ad Regis assueti thalamum, regnique sui
consortium transire fecisti. Ita hanc famulam tuam N. humilitatis nostrae
benedictione Christianae plebis gratia salutis ad dignam sublimemque copulam
Regis nost^i misericorditer transire concedas. Et ut in soedere conjugii semper
mane^s pudica proximam Virginitatis palmam continere queat; tibique Deo vivo
and vero in omnibus and super omnia jugiter placere desideret. Et te inspirante
quae tibi placita sunt toto cord pe^ficiat. Per Dominum nostrum, etc.

Alia Oration.
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus hanc samulam tuam coelesti The an ^ing of the
French Queen.
benedictione sanctisica, et quam in adjutorio regni Reginam eligimus, tua
ubique sapientia doceat atque conforter, et Ecclesia tua fidelem famulam semper
agnoscat. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.

Notandum, quod tunica Reginae and camisia debent ^sse aperte usque ad
corrigiam, and Dominus Archiepiscopus debet inungere eam oleo sancto in capite,
and in pectore, and dicere dum inungit in qualibet Unctione.

In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti, prosit tibi haec Unctio olei
in honorem et confirmationem aeternam in saecula saeculorum.

Amen.
Factia Unctione, dicat Archiepiscopus, Oremus.
Spiritus sancti gratia humilitatis nostrae officio in te copiosa descendat, ut
sicut manibus nost^is indignis oleo materiali oblita pinguescis exterius; ita
ejus in visibili unguine delibuta impinguari mereare inte^ius ejus spirituali
unctione pe^fectissime semper imbuta, et illicita declinare tota mente, et
spernere discas seu valeas, et utilia animae tuae jugiter cogitare, optare,
atque operare queas.

Alia Oration.
Deus Pater aeternae gloriae sit tibi adjutor. Et omnipotens benedicat ti^i,
preces tuas exaudiat, vitam tuam longitudine dierum adimpleat, benedictionem
tuam jugi^er confi^met, tecumomni populo in aeternum conservet, inimicos tuos
confusione ind^at, et super te Christi sanctificatio ac h^s olei infusio
floreat. Ut qui tibi in terris t^ibuit benedictionem, ipse in coelis conferat
meritum Angelorum. Benedicat te, et custodiat in vitam aeternam Dominus noster
Jesus Christus, Qui vivit, etc.

Tunc debet ab Archiepiscopo Annulus immitti digito, et dicere.
Accipe Annulum fidei signaculum sanctae Trinitatis, quo The Ring given to the
French Queen.
possis omnes haereticas pravitates devitare, barbaras gentes, virtute tibi
praestita ad agnitionem veritatis advocare.

Sequitur Oration, Dominus Uobiscum. Oremus.
Deus cujus est omnis potestas and dignitas da famulae tuae signo tuae fidei
prosperum suae dignitatis effectum in qua tibi semper firma maneat, tibique
jugiter placere contendat. Per Dominum, etc.

Post istam Orationem datur ab Archiepiscopo Sceptrum The Scepter given to the
French Queen, and the Rodor Verge.
modicum alterius modi quam Sceptrum Regium, et Virga consimilis Virgae Regiae.
Et in tradendo dicat Archiepiscopus.

Accipe Virgam virtutis and aequitatis, and esto pauperibus misericors, and
affabilis, viduis, pupillis, and orphanis diligentissimam curam exhibeas, ut
Omnipotens Deus augeat tibi gratiam suam. Qui vivit, and regnat.

Sequitur post dationem Seeptriet Virgae haec Oration.
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus affluentem Spiritum tuae benedictionis super
famulam tuam nobis orantibus propitiatus infunde, utque per manus nostrae
impositionem hodie Regina instituitur, sanctificatione tua digna, and electa
permaneat, ut nunquam postmodum de tua gratia separetur indigna. Per Dominum.

Tunc debet ei imponi a solo Archiepiscopo Corona in Capite The Crown put on

ipsius, quam impositam sustentare debent undique Barons. Archiepiscopus autem
debet dicere in impositionem Orationem.

Accipe Coronam gloriae et regalis excellentiae, honorem jocunditatis, ut
splendida fulgeas, et aeterna exultatione Coroneris. Ut scias te esse consortem
regni, populoque Dei semper prospere consulas, et quanto plus exaltaris, tanto
amplius humilitatem diligas atque custodias. Unde sicut exterius auro et gemmis
redimita enites, ita et interius auro sapientiae virtutumque gemmis decorari
contendas, quatenus post occasum hujus saeculi cum prudentibus virginibus
sponso perhenni Domino nostro Jesu Christo dign et laudabiliter occurens,
regiam coelestis aulae merearis ingredi januam, Auxiliante Domino nostro Jesu
Christo, Qui cum Patre, et Spiritu sancto vivit, et regnat per infinita saecula
saeculorum.

Amen.
Post Impositam Coronam dicat Archiepiscopus.
Omnium Domine fons bonorum, and cunctorum dator provectuum, tribue famulaetuae
N. adeptam been regere dignitatem, and a te sibi praestitam in ea bonis
operibus corrobora gloriam. Per Dom.

Domine sancte Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, honorum cunctorum auctor and

tuam Reginam benedictionis gratiae tuae copiam, and quam h^mana sibi electri^
prae^sse ga^det, tuae supernae el^ctionis ac benedictionis infusio accumulet.
Concede ei Domine auctoritatem regiminis, consilii magnitudinem, sapientiae,
prudentiae, and intellectus habundantiam, religionis ac pietatis custodiam
quatenus mereatur benedici, and augmentari in nomine ut Sara, visitari, and
faecundari ut Rebecca, contra omnium muniri monstra vit^orum ut Judith, In
regni regimine eligi ut Hester. Ut quam humana nititur fragilitas benedicere,
coelestis potius intim^ roris and sacri olei repleat infusio. Et quae a Nobis
coronatu^ and benedicitur in Reginam (...) mereatur obtinere in praemio
aeternitatis perpetuae. Et sicut ab hominibus sublimatur in nomine ita a te
sublimetur fide and operatione. Illo etiam sapientiae tuae * cum rore perfunde

aevo annis plurimis, and in sempiterno sine fine aeternis. Praestante Domino
nostro Jesu Christo, qui cum Patre and Spiritu sancto vivit, and regnat Deus.
Per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.

Post istam Orationem Barons qui Coronam ejus sustentant deducunt eam ad
solium, ubi in sede parata collocatur circumstantibus eam Baronibus et Matronis
Nobilioribus in oblatione. In pace ferenda, in communione penitus est ordo
Regis superius annotatus observandus.

Notandum, quod antequam Archiepiscopus dicat, Pax Domini, etc. debet dicere
hanc benedictiouem super Regem, et super populum. Sic.

Benedicat tibi Dominus, custodiatqus te, and sicut voluit te super populum
suum constituere Regem, ita in praesenti saeculo faelicem, and aeternae
faelicitati tribuat esse consortem.

Amen.

Having given you this Account of the Ceremonies and Prayers used at the
Coronations of Foreign Christian Emperors and Kings; I shall next present you
with the Order, Prayers, Ceremonies and Solemnities used at the Coronations of
our ancient Saxon and English Kings; especially with those in later ages, since
our Kings and Queens became Prot^ants, never formerly published in print.

For the manner and ceremonies of the Unction, Benediction and Coronation of
the Kings of England, the Oaths then taken by them, with the Oaths and Homages
made by the Prelates and Nobles to them, mentioned in our Histories, (being not
so pertinent to my Theme) I shall reserr the Readers to peruse them at their
leisure, in Mat. Westminster. Flores Hist. part 1. Anno 435, 445, 454, 465, 498, 516.

lib: Sapientiae, Lectio 74. fol. 73. A. B. where he mentions both the O^th,
Unction, Ceremonies, and some prayers used at our Kings Coronations. I shall
present you 1: With the ancient Form of our Saxon Kings Coronations, and the
prayers used at them; recorded by Mr: Seldom out of the old Saxon Ceremonial.
2ly: With the Ceremonies and prayers used at the Coronation of King Richard the
2. 3ly: With the usual Form of the Coronation of the Kings of England, and
their Queens, and of the Prayers used thereat (never hitherto published, and
omitted by Mr: Seldom, in his Titles of Honor) extracted out of Liber Regalis,
being the form used at the Coronations of Henry the 7, and 8. and their Queens,
King James, and Queen Anne, and our late King Charles. 4ly: With the Form of
the Coronation of the Kings of Scotland, used at the Coronation of our late
King Charles, anno 1633.

For the 1: Titles of Honor, ^art 1. chapter 8. p. 151, 152, 174, 175, 177, 178,
179, 180.
Mr: Seldom (our most learned Antiquary) informs us; That there remains in an
old imperfect Pontifical of the Saxon times, a piece of a Ceremonial for the
Coronation of the Kings and Queens of England, or of the English-Saxons,
wherein after diverse Prayers and Benedictions, this follows for the Anointing.

OMnipotens sempiter^e Deus, Creator ac Gubernator Coeli and Terrae, conditor
and dispositor Angelorum and Hominum, Rex Regum, and Dominus dominantium, qui
Habraham fidelem famulum tuum de hostibus triumphare fecisti; Moysi and Josue
populo tuo Praelatis, multiplicem victoriam tribuisti; humilem quoque David
puerum tuum Regni fastigio sublimasti, eumque de ore Leonis and de manu Besti^
atque Goliae, sed and de gladio maligno Saul, and omnium inimicorum ejus
liberasti, and Salomonem sapientiae pacisque ineffabili munere ditasti;
respice, quaesumus Domine, ad preces nostrae humilitatis, and super hunc
famulum tuum, illum quem supplici devotione in Regem Anglorum vel Saxonum
pariter eligimus, Benedictionum tuarum dona multiplica. Hunc dextera tuae
potentiae semper ubique circunda, quatenus praedicti Abrahae fidelitate
firmatus, Moysi mansuetudine fretus, Josuae fortitudine munitus, David
humilitate exaltatus, Salomonis sapientia decoratus, tibi in omnibus
complac^at, and per tramitem justitiae inoffenso gressu semper incedat. Hic
totius Regni Anglo-Saxonum Ecclesiam deinceps cum plebibus sibi annexis ita
enutriat ac doceat, muniat, and instruat, contraque omnes visibiles and
invisibiles hosts idem potenter regaliterque tuae virtutis regimen
amministret, ut regale solium, videlicet Anglorum vel Saxonum * Sce^tro, ^.
Sceptrum.
non des^rat, sed ad pristinae fidei pacisque concordiam eorum animos, te
opitulante, reformet, ut populorum debita subjectione fultus, condigno amore
glorificatus per longum vitae spatium, paternae apicem gloriae, tuae
miseratione unita, stabilire and gubernare mereatur. Tuae quoque protectionis
galea munitus and scuto insuper abili jugiter protectus, protectus coelestibus
circundatus, optabilis victoriae triumphum de hostibus foeliciter capiat,
terroremque suae potentiae infidelibus inferat, and pacem tibi militantibus
laetanter reportet. Uirtutibus, Christ, hune quibus praefatos fideles tuos
decorasti, multiplici honoris benedictione condecora, and in regimine regni
sublimiter colloca, et oleo gratiae Spiritus Sancti perunge, per Dominum, in
unitate ejusdem.

The Rubrique to this Prayer, is thus; Consecratio Regis ab Episcopo qui arcem
tenuerit super eum dicenda, which I understand for the Archbishop: And after
the prayer follows this Rubrique. Hic unguatur oleo and haec cantetur
Antiphona, the Anthem being thus,

Unxerunt Salomonem Sado^h Sacerdos and Nathan Propheta Regem in Gion, et
accedentes dixerunt, Vivat Rex in aeternum.

Quam sequatur Oration.
Christ perunge hunc Regem in regimen unde uncxisti Sacerdotes Reges and
Prophetas ac Martyrs qui per fidem vieerunt regna, and operati sunt Justitiam,
atque adepti sunt repromissiones. Tua sacratissima unctio super caput ejus
defluat, atque ad interiora descendat and cordis illius intima penetret, and
promissionibus, quas adepti sunt victoriosissimi Reges, gratia tua dignus
efficiatur, quatenus et in praesenti seculo feliciter regnet, and ad eorum
consortium in coelesti regno perveniat per Dominum.

Alia.
Deus electorum Fortitudo et humilium Celsitudo, qui in primordio per
effusionem diluvii, crimina mundi castigare voluisti, et per Columbam ramum
olivae portantem pacem terris redditam demonstrasti, iterumque Aaron famulum
tuum per Unctionem Olei Sacerdotem sancxisti, et post a per hujus unguenti
infusionem ad regendum populum Israeliticum Sacerdotes ac

Reges et Prophetas praefecisti vultumque Ecclesiae -- -- --

There the Copy is defective; nor has it more that concerns Anointing the
King. But after the Ceremonies that belong to the whole Coronation of the King,
follows the fo^m of the crowning the Queens also of that age, who were likewife
anointed.

Sequitur consecratio Reginae quae propter honorificentiam ( so are the words
of the Rubrique) ab Epis opo ^acri unguinis oleo super verticem perfundenda
est, et in Ecclesia coram Opti^atibus cum condigno honor and Regia
celsitudine, and in Regalis thori consortium benedicenda and consecranda est,
quae etiam Annulo pro integritate fidei and Corona pro aeternit^tis gloria
decoranda est.

The words used at their anointing were,

In Nomine Patris, and Filii, and Spiritus Sancti, prosit tibi (...) Unctio
Olei in honorem et confirmationem aeternam in saecula saeculorum. Amen:

-- -- and cunctos sanctae Dei Ecclesiae adversarios regnumque tibi commissum
tutari atque protegere Castra Dei, per auxilium invictissimi Triumphatoris
Domini nostri Jhesis Christi, qui cum Patre in Vnitate Spiritus Sancti vivit
and regnat.

Then it goes on thus, in the Kings Coronation.

Oration post datum Gladium.
Deus qui providentia tua coelestia simul and terrena moderaris, propitiare
Christianissimo Regi nostro, ut omnis hostium suorum fortitudo virtute Glad^
spiritualis frangatur, ac te pro illo pugnante, penitus conteratur per, etc.

Hic Coronetur Rex, eique dicatur.
Coronet te Deus Corona Gloriae atque Justitiae, honor and opere fortitudinis,
ut per officium benedictionis cum fide recta and multiplici bonorum operum
fructu, ad Coronam pervenias regni perpetui, ipso largiente cujus regnum
permanet in seculorum.

Amen.
Oration super Regem postquam Corona fuerit imposita super caput ejus.
Deus perpetuitatis, Dux virtutum, cunctorum hostium victor, benedic hunc
famulum tuum N. tibi caput suum humilit^r inclinantem, and prolix^ sanitate and
prospera felicitate eum conserva, ut ubicunque vel pro quib^ scunque auxilium
tu^m invocaverit cit^ adsis and protegas ac defendas. Tribue e^, quaesumus,
Domine divitias gratiae tuae; comple in bonis desiderium ejus; Corona eum in
misericordia tua, ut tibi Domine pia de^otione famuletur per, etc.

Which are the same almost in a Syllable that in the latter Ceremonials of the
English Coronation, are appointed for the particular time of the putting on the
Crown.

By the same old Ceremonial also, the Queen after her Unction and receiving the
Ring, is to be Crowned with these words, which are also in the latter Forms.

Accipe Coronam gloriae, et honorem jo^nditatis, ut splendida fulg^as et
aeterna exultatione Coroneris per, etc.

Alia.
Omnium Domine fons bonorum et eunctorum dator prosectuum, tribue famulae tuae
N. adeptam been regere dignitatem, et a te sibi p^estitam in ea bonis operi^us
corroborare gloriam, per Dominum nostrum, etc.

Hic detur Regi Sceptrum eique dicatur.
Accipe Sceptrum Regiae potestatis insigne, Virgam scilicet regni rectam, virg
am virtutis, qua teipsum been reg^, et Sanctam Eccl^siam populumque videlicet
Christianum tibi a Deo commissum Regia virtute ab improbis defendas. Pravos
corrigas, rectos pacifices, et ut viam rectam tenere possint, tuo juvamine
dirigas, quatenus de temporali regno ad aeternum regnum pervenias. Ipso
adjuvante cujus regnum et imperium sine fine permanet in secula seculorum.

Amen.
Oration super Regem postquam datum fuerit ei Sceptrum.
Omnium Domine fons bonorum, cunetorumque Dominus Institutor profectuum, tribue
quaeso famulo tuo Illi. adeptam been regere dignitatem, et a te sibi concessum
honorem dignare corroborare Honorifica eum prae cunctis Regibus Britanniae,

consolida, visita eum in sobole, et praesta ei prolixitatem vitae. In diebus
ejus superoriatur Justitia, ut ^um jocunditate et laeticia aeterno glorietur in
regno per, etc.

Hic Regi Virga This was given into the left hand, as the Scepter into the
right. See Mat. Pa is page 206. edit. Londin.
detur eique dicatur.
Accipe This is in the old Ritual called Ordo Romanus
Virgam virtutis atque aequitatis, qua intelligas mulcere pios and terrere
reprobos. Errantes viam doce, lapsisque manum porrige, disperdasque superbos,
and releves humiles, ut aperiat tibi ostium Ihesus Christus Dominus noster, qui
de seipso ait. Ego sum ostium, per me si quis introierit salvabitur, Et ipse
qui est Clavis David and Sceptrum Domus Israhel qui aperit and nemo claudit,
claudit et nemo aperit. Sit tibi adjutor qui educit vinctum de domo Carceris,
sedentem in tenebris et um^ra mortis, ut in omnibus sequi merearis eum de quo
Propheta David cecinit. Dominus in saeculum saeculi, virga recta est virga
Regni tui. Imitare ipsum qui dicit, diligas Justitiam and hodio habeas
iniquitatem, propterea unxit te Dominus Deus tuus oleo laetitiae ad exemplum
illius quem ante saecula unxerat prae particip^bus suis, Thesum Christum
Dominum nostrum.

Benedictio ad Regem.
Extendat omnipotens Dominus dexteram suae benedictionis, et effundat super te
donum suae protectionis, Sanctae Mariae, ac Beati Petri Apostolorum Principis,
Sanctique Gregorii Anglorum Apostolici, atque omnium sanctorum intercedentibus
meritis. Amen.

Indulgeat tibi Dominus omnia mala quae gessisti, et tribuat tibi gratiam et
misericordiam quam humiliter ab eo deposcis, ut liberet te ab ad^ersitatibus
cunctis, et ab omnibus visibilium et invisibilium inimicorum insidiis. Amen.

Angelos suos bonos semper et ubique qui te praecedant, comitentur, et
subsequantur, ad custodiam tui ponat, et a peccato seu gladio, et ab omnium
periculorum discrimine sua te potentia liberet. Amen

Inimicos tuos adpacis caritatisque benignitatem convertat, et bonis omnibus te
gratiosum, et amabilem faciat, pertinaoes quoque in tui insectatione et odio,
confusione salutari induat, super te autem sanctificatio sempiterna floreat.

Uictoriosum te atque triumphatorem de invisibilibus atque visibilibus hostibus

Die Jovis, id est 16 die Julii, videlicet 17 Calend. Ordo coronationis
Richardi secundi.
Augusti, vigilia sancti Kenelmi Regis, convenientibus Archiepiscopo et
Episcopis Regnique Proceribus ad Westmonast. summo mane, ordinata processione
Monachorum in capis, Episcopi cum Monachis ad ostium Regii thalami pervenerunt,
et paratum Regem reperientes ibidem, per manus qui ejus lateribus astiterunt,
perduxerunt in Ecclesiam Sancti Petri, cantantes Antiphonam in honorem
Apostoli, cum oratione competenti adjuncta et hac oratione: Deu^ humilium
visitator, qui nos tua misericordia consolaris, praetende super famulum tuum
Regem nostrum miserico^diam tuam, ut per eum tuum in nobis adesse sentiamus
adventum. Rex vero mox ut altar perve^t, prostravit se solo tenu: ante altar,
pavimentum autem st^atum f^it palliis et tapetis. Prosecuta ut diximus
oratione, Archiepiscopus cum Epi^copis qui aderant, prostravit se super
pavimentum circa Regem. Inte^im duo Episcopi Letaniam devote cantarunt. Qua
expleta, erectus Rex, ductus est ad sedem suam: Choro hanc Antiphonam
decantante, Firmetur manus tua. Tunc Episcopus sermonem ^cit de materia Regis
et Regni ad populum, qualiter Rex se haberet in populo, and in quibus populus
fibi debuit obedire. Quo completo, juravit Rex coram Archiepiscopo et
Proceribus qui ibi aderant, quoniam ipsi soli ejus juramentum audire potuerunt,
quod Ecclesiam suis permitteret gaudere libertatibus, et Iur amentum regis ante
coronationem suam.
eam ac Ministros ejus honoraret, et fidem rectam teneret, rapacitatem et omnes
iniquitates in omnibus gradibus interdiceret. Secundo, ut leges terrae bonas
ubi^ue servari faceret, et praecipue leges S. Edwardi Regis et Confessoris qui
in eadem requie^cit Ecclesia, et malas leges faceret abrogari. Tertio, ut non
esset personarum acceptor, sed judicium rectum inter virum et virum faceret, et
praecipue misericordiam observaret, sicut sibi suam indulgeat misericordia^
clemens, et misericors Deus. Quibus expletis, Archiepiscopus praecedente eum
Mareschallo Angliae Domino Henrico Percy, convertit se ad omnes plagas
Ecclesiae, indicans populo Regium juramentum, et quaerens, si se tali Principi
ac Rectori subjicere et ejus jussionibus obtemperare vellent? Et responsum est
a plebe tisone clamore, quod libenter sibi parere vellent. Archiepiscopus Regem
his orationibus benedixit, Preces dicendae in coro^atione.
videlicet, Omnipotens et sempiterne Deus, benedic Domine hunc Regem nostrum,
qui regna omnium moderaris a saeculo, tali eum benedictione glorifica, ut
Davidicae teneat sublimitatis seeptrum, et glorificatus in ejus propitius
repe^atur merito; da ei tuo inspiramine, cum manfuetudine ita regere populu^
^cut Solomon fecisti regnum obtinere pacificum. Tibi cum timore semper sit
subditus, tibique militet cum quiet; sit tuo clypeo protectus cum Proceribus,
et ubique tua gratia victor existat. Honorifica eum prae cunctis regibus
gentium. Felix populis dominetur, et faeliciter eum nationes adorent, vivat in
gentium catervis magnanimus, sit in judiciis aequitatis singularis, locupletet
eum tua praedives gr tia, fructiferam habeat patriam, et ejus liberis tribuas
profutura. Praesta ei prolixitatem vitae per tempora, ut in diebus ejus oriatur
justicia, a te robustum teneat regiminis solium, et cum jucunditate et justicia
aeterno gloriatur in regno. Ista praemissa benedictio post primam orationem ad
modum praefationis ab Archiepiscopo cantabitur, qua cantata, dicta est and alia
oration super eum, scilicet; Deus ineffabilis, cum Antiphona, Comfortare and
esto vir fortis, etc. Tunc Archiepiscopus accessit ad eum, and vestimenta sua
discindens manibus suis a summo usque ad imum, exuit eum praeter camisiam
vestimentis suis. Custodes vero quinque portuum ex officio tam in processione
quam in unctione and Missa, et post Missam dum iret ad palatium ab Ecclesia,
semper tenuerunt umbraculum sericum magnum coloris aerii, 4. hastis per quatuor
angulos colligatum. Sed non obstante umbraculo supradicto, mox antequam
Archiepiscopus eum suis vestibus exuisset, allatus est pannus aureus a
comitibus, sub quo latuit dum unctionis perciperet Sac^amenta. Archiepiscopus
(ut diximus) eo nudato, unxit manus ejus de oleo sanctificato, unde uncti
fuerunt Reges and Prophetae, and sicut unxit Samuel Davidem in regem, ut sis
benedictus and constitutus Rex in regno isto super populum istum, quem Dominus
Deus tuus dedit tibi ad regendum and gubernandum. Item dixit orationem, Propice
omnipotens Deus. Post haec unxit Archiepiscopus caput ejus, and pectus, and
scapulas, ambasque compages brachiorum, dicens: Unguantur caput istud, pectus,
and scapulae, and compages brachiorum de oleo sanctificato, etc. ut supra. Et
interim chorus cantavit Antiphonam, Unxe^nt regem Salomonem in Gyan, Sadock
Sacerdos, and Nathan Propheta, and ascendentes laeti dixerunt, vivat. Alleluia.
Postquam subjunxit Metropolitanus, Deus dei filius Jesus Christus dominus
noster, qui a Patre oleo exultationis unctus est p^ae participibus suis, ipse
per (...) sacri unguinis infusionem spiritum paracleti super caput tuum
infundat, benedictionemque eandem usque interiora cordis tui penetrare faciat,
quatenus hoc visibili and tractabili dono invisibilia per^ipere and temporali
regno justis moderaminibus executo aeternaliter cum eo regnare merearis. Mox
finita oratione, Archiepi^copus c^m Episcopis, hymnum, Veni c^eator spiritus,
rege interim prostrato in ^onga venia, and circa eum Metropolitano cum
suffraganeis suis. Expleto hymno, erectus est Rex ab Archiepiscopo, and indutus
est primo tunica S. Ed. and post ejusdem dalmatica, projecta circa collum ejus
stola, Archiepiscopo orationes competentes interim p^osequente. Post haec
Archiepi^copus cum Episcopis tradidit ei gladium, ita dicens: Accipe gladium
per manus Episcoporum, licet indignas, vice tamen and autoritate sanctorum
Apostolorum (...) tibi regaliter impositum, nostraeque benedictionis officio
defensionem fanctae Ecclesiae divinitus ordinatum, and esto memor de Psalmista
qui prophetavit, dicens: Accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum potentissime, u^
per eundem vim aequitatis exerceas, molem iniquitatis potenter destruas, and
sanctam Dei Ecclesiam, ejusque fideles p^opugnando protegas, nec minus sub fide
falsos quam Christiani nominis hosts execreris ac destruas; viduas and
pupillos clementer adj^ves ac defendas, desolata restaures, restaurata
conserves, ulciscaris injusta, confirms been disposita, quatenus haec in
agendo virtutum triumpho gloriosus justiciae cultor eg^egius, cum mundi
salvatore, cujus typum geris in nomine, sine fine merearis regnare. Tunc duo
Comites eum gladio accinxerunt: quo facto, Archiepiscopus armillas dedit ei,
dicens: Accip^ armillas sinceritatis and sapientiae, divinaequecircundationis
indicium, quibus intelligas omnes operationes tuas contra hosts visibiles and
invisibiles posse esse munitas. Postea inducit eum Archiepiscopus regali
pallio, ita dicens: Accipe pallium quatuor nunciis formatum, per quod
intelligas quatuor mundi parts divinae potestati esse subjectas, nec quenquam
posse faeliciter regnare in terris, nisi cui potestas regnandi fuerit collata
de coelis. Interim dum Archiepiscopus benedixit coronam regiam duo Comites
calcaria verunt, ad quorum officium pertinebat. Benedicta corona Archiepiscopus
imposuit super caput, dicens: Coronat te Deus corona gloriae atque justiciae,
honor and opere fortitudinis, ^t officium (...) benedictionis, cum fide recta,
and m^ltiplici bonorum operum fructu ad coronam pervenias regni perpetui. Tunc
dedit ei Archiepiscopus an^lum, cum his verbis: Accipe anulum regiae
dignitatis, and per hunc, vitae catholicae fidei signaculum, quia ut hodie
ordinaris caput and princeps regni ac populi, ita perseverabis author and
stabilitor Christianitatis and christianae fidei, ut faelix in opere, locuples
in fide, cum rege regum glorieri^ Statim ^ost haec accessit Dominus de
Furneval, ex officio offerens ei rubeam chirothecam, quam Archiepiscopus
benedixit and imposuit manui regiae, dans ei sceptrum his verbis, dicens:
Accipe sceptrum regiae potestatis insigne, virgam scilicet regni rectam, virgam
virtutis qua te ipsum been regas, sanctam Ecclesiam, populum videlicet
christianu^ tibi a Deo commissum, regia virtute ab improbis defendas, pravos
corrigas, rectos pontifices, and ut viam rectam tenere possint tuo juvamine
dirigas, quatenus de temporali regno ad aeternum regnum pervenias. Tunc dedit
ei Archiepisc. virgam in alia manu, habente^ in summitate columba^, nam
sceptrum quod susceperat consurrexi^ de rotundo globo aureo que^ tenebat in
manu chirothecata, and habebat in summitate signum crucis, and accepit virgam
praedict. cum verbis his: Accipe virga^ virtutis and aequitatis qua intelligas
te mulcere pios, et terrere reprobos, errantes viam doce, lapsisque manum
porrige, disperdasque superbos, and reveles humiles, ut apareat tibi hostium
Jesus Christus Dominus noster. Post haec benedictus est Rex ab Archiepiscopo
ita dicente: Benedicat te Deus custodiatque te, sieut te voluit super populum
suum esse regem, ita in praesenti saeculo felicem aeternae felicitatistribuat
esse consortem. His itaque peractis, osculatns est Rex Episcopos omnes and
Abbates, a quibus statim ductus est postea ad regale solium, Episcopis
inchoantibus hymnum Te Deum laudamus. Finito hymno, Archiepiscopus ita eum
allocutus est: Sta and retine amodo locum quem hucusque paterna successione
tenuisti haereditarie, indico tibi delegatum per authoritatem Dei omnipotentis,
and prae^entem raditionem stram, scilicet omnium Episcoporum caeterorumque Dei
servorum, and quanto clerum sac^is altaribus propinquiorem, tanto ei potiorem
in locis congruis honorem impendere memine^ is, quaten^s mediator Dei and
homin^m, te mediatorem plebis in hoc regni solio confirmet, and in regnum
aeternum regnare faciat Jesus Christus Dominus Solemnizatio missae in die
cor^nationis.
noster.

His itaque peractis, inchoata est missa congruens co ronationi regiae, cujus
officium fuit, Protector nost^r aspice Deus, etc. Epist. Subj^cti estote omni
humanae creaturae p^opter Deum, etc. Gradale. Dirigatur Domine oration mea.

Primoigitur obtulit Archiepiscopo gladium suum quem susceperat, and postea
quantum placuit, sed non min^s marca propter consuetudinem: nam plus potest
offerre Deo and sancto Petro si placuerit. Post oblationem pecuniae, obtulit
Archiepiseopo panem and vinum ad modum Monachorum, unde postea, tam
Metropolitanus, quam ipse Rex, communicati fuerunt. Quo facto, Comes ad cujus
officium pertine^at portare gladium coram Rege, gladium quem obtulerat dato
precio redemit, and assumens eum, portabat coram illo. Percelebrata missa usque
ac comm^nionem reductus est Rex ad altar, and genuflexo coram Archiepiscopo,
dixit, confiteor. Quo absoluto, communicatus est, and iterum reductus est ad
sedem suam. Interea praeparavit se quidam miles Domin^s John moc reg. (...)
J^hannes cognomento Dimmock, qui clamabat se habere jus ad defendendum jura
Regis illo die, and etiam si opus esset duello co^^igendum, si aliquis
praesumeret affirmare Regem non habere jus in regno Angliae, quanqua^ per ante
Dominus Baldwin^s F^evill idem officium calumniasset, sed minime obtinuisset.
Iste ergo Dominus Johannes memoratus circa finem Missae incessit ad valvas
Ecclefiae armatus decentissime, insidens dextra^ium pulcherime phaleratum,
caput etiam and pectus armatum, quem idem Dominus Johannes assumpsit de stabulo
regio, utens videlicet avita consuetudine tam in aequo quam a^mis eligendis de
thesauro Regis. Nam and optimum equum p^aeter unum, and praeter unam praecipuam
armaturam facturus dictum officium elegit ad vota sua. Veniens ig^tur ad ostium
Monasterii, praeequitantibus duobus, qui ejus lancea^ and clypeum porta verunt,
expectavit ibidem sinem Missae. Mareschallus autem Dom. Henr: Percye facturus
viam coram Rege cum Seneschallo Angliae, scilicet Duce and Constabulario Dom.
Tho. Woodstock atque fratre ejusdem Marescalli Domino Thoma Percy, qui omnes
magnos inequitavere dextrarios, venit ad dictum militem, dicens, non debere eum
ea hora venire, sed quod usque ad prandium Regis differret adventum suum.
Quapropte^ monuit ut rediret, et deposito tanto onere armorum, quiesceret ad
illud tempus. Miles vero juxta confilium Mareschalli facturus abscessit. Illico
post decessum militis praeequitantibus Regem Dominis supradictis super
dextrarios suos, necnon praecedente magno numero diversi generis histrionum,
portatus est in humeris militum usque ad regale palatium, ductus quoque in
cameram, paulisper quievit: debilis enim fuerat prae labor parum commedens.
Postea veniens in aulam, creavit quatuor novos Comites antequam accessit ad
mensam. Dominum namque Thomam Woodstock avunculum suum Comitem Buckingam, datis
fibi milles marcis annuatim de thesauro regio donec^sibi de terris tanti
valoris providisser. Dominum etiam Gifardum de Angolismo quondam magistrum suum
fecit comitem Huntington, datis insuper sibi mill marcis annui^ usquequo
providisset sibi de redditibus tanti valoris: Domino de Moubray dedit comitatum
Notyngamiae, et Domino Henrico Percy Northumbriae comitatum: Milites quoque
fecit novem eodem die. Q^ibus expleti^, ascendit ad mensam, ubi epulabantur cum
eo splendide Episcopi, Comites and Barons, et innumera multitudo ple^is
confl^xerat in illam aulam praegrandem, qu^d nisi Dux Lancastriae, videlicet
Senescallus Angliae, et Comes Buckinghamiae regni Constabularius, et Dominus
Hen^icus Percy Mare^challus, cum multis aliis, viam super equos grandes
servientibus in aula fecissent, ferentes sercula ad convivas minime
pernetrassent. Si numerare contenderem convivii apparatum, divitias utensilium,

certos gradus, cujus summitatem occupabat grandis aurata aquila, sub cujus
pedibus in capitello columnae per quatuor parts vina diversi generis
dec^rrebant per totum diem coronationis regiae, nec erat qui aliquem vel

Episcopis et Abbatibus qui coronationi interfuerant, necnon ipse Dux cum
Magnatibus et Plebis multitudine copiosa. In progress^ autem processionis
concionatus est ad populum Episcopus Roffensis, hortans ut dissentiones et
discordiae ortae, et diu continuatae, inter plebem et Dominos sopirentur,
proban^ per multa argumenta hujuscemodi diffentiones Deo plurimum displicere:
hortatus insuper Dominos, ne tantis de caetero sine causa taxationibus populum
onerarent. Monuit etiam ut si causa subesset rationabilis qua oporteret eos
omnino juva^e Regem and Regnum, ut patienter Conc. Roff. Ep.

exhortatur eos generaliter qui Regi puero and innocenti adhaererent, ut
relictis vitiis quibus inserviebant, videlicet stupris in fornicationibus, and
adulteriis, ejus puritati and innocentiae se conformare studerent, asserens hoc
omnino patri patriae oportunum, perfacileque regi a recto deviare, regnum and
populum periclitari, si tales essent qui ei sedulo and ejus confilio
ministrarent. Sermon finito, Domini and universi Praelati ad sua secedunt.

Forma Coronationis Regum and Reginarum Angliae, (written, as I conceive, in
the reign of King RICHARD the II.)
INprimis, Princeps noviter coronandus ante diem coronationis Rex equitabit.
suae nobili and decentissimo cultu apparetur equitando a Turri London: usque
ad palatium Regii Westmonasterii capite denudato, equitantibus cum eo Dominis
temporalibus, and universitate Civitatis London, cum aliis Proceribus and
populis.

Item provideatur quod in die coronationis praedictae in Seeds Regalis.
magna Aula Regis Westmonasterii sit seeds Regalis, eminens, pannis cericis,
and inauratis cum quissimis and tapetis decenter ornata.

Item provideatur quod in Ecclesia Westmonaster: sit unum Pulpitum.
Pulpitum cum gradibus utraque part ejusdem, et been ornetur cum pannis ex
omni part, and in area ejus.

Item provideatur quod in dicto Pulpito fit Thronus Thronus Regalis.
Regalis et seeds, in quo Rex sedere debet decentissime ornatus cum palliis
sericis, and quissimis inauratis.

Item notandum, quod Abbas Westmon. qni pro tempore Abbas Westmonast.
fuerit, per biduum vel triduum ante coronationem Regis aut Reginae informabit
eos de observantiis eorum faciendis in eorum coronatione, and ad mundandas
eorum conscientias ante perceptionem saciae unctionis. Et si Abbas fuerit
mortuus, infirmus, aut in partibus remotis, aut legitime impeditus, tunc debet
eligi unus Monachus de gremio Ecclesiae per conventum Westmon. qui vices Abbati
supplebit in hoc casu.

Item dicto die Coronationis Princeps coronandus in Tunica and Camisia.
prae^ata sede Regali elevabitur in dicta Aula, ipso tamen prius balneato. Et
post balneum praeparentur sibi tunica, and camisia serica aperta usque ad
pectus, and inter scapulas, and in compagibus brachiorum, ape^turis tunicae and
camisiae praedictarum sibi invicem connexis ansulis argent. and super dictam
tunicam induatur aliis vestimentis nobilibus, and tantummodo caligis sine
sotularibus calcietur.

Item ordinetur processio per Abbatem and Conventum Process^.
Westmon. solemnis in capit. de Ecclesia Westmon. ad sedem Regalem praedictam
in Aula praedicta in qua Princeps expectatur. In qua processione erunt
Archiepiscopi Episcopi, and alii Praelati. Et tunc descendit Princeps et
sequitur processionem in Ecclesiam W^stmon. and ibit super pannum s^agulatum
positum in dicta sede super terram usque ad pulpitum in praedicta Ecclesia
W^stmon. ambulabunt and cantabunt in dicta processione quae in receptione Regum

Ecclesiam Westmon. A^as Westminster.


Item Abbas Westmon. autMonachus supplens vices ejus, semper debet Regis and
Reginae lateri adhaerere pro eorum Archiepiscopus inquiret voluntatem Po^i.
informatione continua.

Item postquam Princeps paululum quieverit in Cathedra seu throno in dicto
Pulpito ordinat. tunc Archiepiscopus Cantuarienfis quatuor parts dicti Pulpiti
alta voce inquiret a plebe voluntatem de dicti Principis Coronatione, ipso
Principe interim stante in dicto throno seu Cathedra, atque ad quatuor parts
dicti Pulpiti, dum Archiepiscopus populum alloquitur, se vertente. Et post
dictam interrogationem cantetur Antiphona: Firmetur manus tua.

Item finita Antiphona praedicta, descendat Rex de pulpito Oblatio Regis.
praedicto usque ad magnum altar ducentibus eum super quod tenetur offere
pallium unum, and unam libram auri, ejus complendo praeceptum qui dixit: Non
apparebis vacuus in conspectu Domini Dei tui.

Item post oblationem factam prosternat se Rex super Rex prosternitur.
pavimentum ante altar prius per Regis Ministros pannis and quissimis
decentibus sericis stratum, donec Archiepiscopus superdixerit orationem, Domine
sanctum, etc. Et tunc fiat sermo ad populum.

Item finito sermon accedat Rex ad altar ad fa^iendum Rex praestat juramenta.
juramentum suum, quod debet confirmare cum sacramento Dominici corporis.

Item tunc incipiatur hymnus, Veni creator Spiritus, and solenniter decantetur,
quo inchoato, prosternat se Rex, ut prius coram magno altari super letania and
Lectio ex toto decantetur, quibus decantatis surget Rex, and refideat in
Cathedra sua paululum quiescens

Item postea surgat Rex de Cathedra, and vadat ad altar Unctio Regis.
and deponat vestes suas praeter tunicam and camisiam praedictas, ut recipiat
unctionem, choro canente Antiphona: Unxerunt Salomonem, cum oratione
subsequenti. Et tunc ungatur in quinque locis, viz. in manibus internis, in
pectore, inter scapulas, in compagibus brachiorum, and in capite, in modum
crucis cum oleo sancto. Et postea in capite faciendo crucem cum chrismate,
ansutis praedictarum tunicae and camisiae prius apertis.

Item post unctionem praedictam and lineis panniculis detersis, qui postea
debent comburi, connectantur ansutae aperturarum praedictae propter unctionem,
ab Abbate Westmon. vel ejus vices supplente.

Item post unctionem capitis Regis, idem caput cooperiatur Abbas Westmonast
deponet pi^um Regi.
pileo lineo propter unctionem sanctam: et sic permanebit usque ad octavum diem

The Coronation of King Edward the sixth.
THis day the Lord Protector and others his coexecutors, whose names be
hereunto subscribed, upon mature and deep Deliberation had amongst them, did
finally resolve, that forasmuch as diverse of the old observances and
ceremonies to foretimes used at the Coronation of the Kings of this Realm, were
by them thought meet for sundry Respects to be corrected, and namely for the
tedious length of the same, which should weary and be hurtsome peradventure to
the Kings Majesty, being yet of tender age, fully to endure and bide out. And
also for that many points of the same, were such as by the Laws of this Realm,
at this present, were not allowable. The Kings Majesty's Coronation should be
done and celebrated upon Shrovesunday next ensuing in the Cathedral Church at
W^stminster, after the form and order ensuing.

First the Archbishop of Canterbury shall show the King to the people at 4.
parts of a great Pulpit or Stage, to be made for the King, and shall say on
this wise.

Sirs, here I present King Edward, rightful and undoubted inheritor, by the
Laws of God and Man, to the Royal Dignity and Crown Imperial of this Realm,
whose Consecration, E^nction and Coronation is appointed by all the Nobles and
Peers of this Land, to be this day. Will you serve at this time, and give your
good wills and asse^ts to the same Consecration, Enunction and Coronation, as
by your duty of Allegiance ye be bound to do?

The people do answer, Yea, Yea, Yea, and and cry, King Edward, King Edward,
King Edward.

This done, the Archbishop of Canterbury, being revested as he should go to
Mass, with the Bishops of London and Winchester on both side, with other
Bishops, and the Dean of Westminster, in the Bishops absence, to go in order
before the King. The King shall be brought from his seat by them that assisted
him to the Church, to the high Altar: where after his prayer made to God for
his Grace, he shall offer a Pall, and a pound of Gold, 24. l. in Coin, which
shall be to him Delivered by the Lord great Chamberlain.

Then shall the King fall grovelling before the Altar, and over him the
Archbishop shall say this Collect, Deus humili^m, etc.

Then the King shall rise, and go to his ^hair to be prepared before the Altar,
his face to the Alt^, and standing one shall hold him a Book, And the
Archbishop standing before the King, shall ask him with a loud and distinct
voice, in manner and form following.

Will ye grant to keep to the people of England, and other your Realms and
Dominions, the Laws and Liberties of this Realm, and other your Realms and
Dominions?

I grant and promise.
You shall keep to your strength and power, to the Church of God, and to all
the people, holy peace and concord.

I shall keep.
You shall make to be done, after your strength and power, equal and rightful
justice in all your Dooms and Judgments, with mercy and trot^.

I shall do.
Do ye grant to make no new Laws, but such as shall be to the honor and glory
of God, and to the good of the Commonwealth, and that the same shall be made
by the consent of your people, as has been accustomed?

I grant and promise.
Then shall the King rise out of his Chair, and by them that before assisted
him, be led to the high Alt^r, where he shall make a solemn oath upon the
Sacrament laid upon the said Altar, in the sight of all the people, to observe
the premisse, and laying his ^and again on the Book shall say.

The things which I have before promised, I shall observe and keep, so God help
me and these holy Evangelist^, by Me bodily touched upon this holy Altar.

That done, the King shall fall again g^oveling before The Arch-i ishop
kneeleth.
the high Altar, and the said Archbishop kneeling before him, shall with a loud
voice begin, Veni Creator, etc.

Which done, the said Arch^ishop standing shall say over the King, Te
invocamus, etc. and at the end shall kneel again: And then shall the King rise,
and be set in the Chair again. And after a little pawse, he shall rise, and
assisted with those that did before that Office, go again to the high Altar,
where he shall be unclothed by his great Chamberlain unto his coat of Crimson
satin, which, and also his shirt, shall be opened before and behind on his
shoulders, and the bought of his Arms by the said great Chamberlain, to the
intent that on those places he be anointed, and whilst he is in the Anointing,
Sir Anthony Denny, and Sir William Herbert must hold a pall over him. And first
the said Archbishop shall anoint the King The Archbishop anointeth kneeling.
kneeling in the palms of his hands, saying these words. Unguantur manus, etc.
With this Collect, ^espice omnipotens Deus. After he shall anoint him in the
breast, in the midst of his back, on his two boughts of his Arms, and on his
head making a Cross. And after making another Cross on his head with holy
Cream, saying as he annointeth the places aforesaid, Ungatur Caput, ungantur
Scapulae, etc. During which time of unction, the Quier shall continually sing,
ung^runt Regem, and the psalm, Domine in virtute tua laetabitur Rex. And it is
to be remembered, that the Bishop or Dean of Westminster, after the Kings
enunction, shall dry all the places of his body where he was anointed, with
Cotton, or some Linen cloth, which is to be burnt. And forthwith the places
opened for the same are to be clozed by the Lord Great Chamberlain. And on the
Kings hands shall be put by the said Archbishop of Canterbury, a pair of Linen
gloves, which the Lord Great Chamberlain shall before see prepared.

This done, the King shall rise, and the Archbishop of Canterbury shall put
upon the King a Tabert of Tarteron white, shaped in manner of a Dalmatick. And
he shall put upon the Kings head a Coiff, the same to be brought by the Great
Chamberlain.

Then the King shall take the Sword he was girt withal, and offer it himself
to God, laying it on the Altar, in token that his strength and power should
first come from God. And the same Sword he shall take again from the Altar, and
Deliver to some great Earl to be redeemed of Five pound to redeem the Sword.
the Bishop or Dean of Westminster for one hundred shillings. Which Sword shall
be borne naked afterward before the King.

Then the King being set in his Chair before the Altar, shall be crowned with
King Edwards Crown, and there The King is Crowned with St. Edwards Crown.
shall be brought by the Bishop or Dean of Westminster, the Regal Sandals and
Spurs to be presently put on by the Lord Great Chamberlain, and the Spurs again
immediately taken off, that they do not incumber him.

Then the Archbishop with all the Peers and Nobles, shall convey the King
sustained as before, again into the Pulpit, setting him in his Siege Royal, and
then shall the Archbishop begin, Te Deum laudamus, etc. which done, the
Archbishop shall say unto the King, S^a et retine amodo locum. And being the
King thus set, all the Peers of the Realm and Bishops holding up their hands,
shall make Homage.
unto him Homage as follows,

First the Lord Protector alone, Then the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord
Chancellor, So two and two as they be placed.

I. N. become your Liege man of lieff and limme, and of earthly worship, and
faith and troth I^hall bear unto you, against all manner of Folks, as I am
bound by any allegiance, and by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, So help us
God and All-Hallows.

And then every one shall kiss the Kings left cheek which done, all there
holding up their hands together, in token of their fidelity, shall with one
voice on their knees say,

We offer to sustain and defend you and your Crown, Nota.
with our Lives, Lands and Goods, against all the world, And with one voice to
cry, God save King Edward, which the people shall cry accordingly Then shall
the King be led to his Traverse to hear the high Mass, and so depart home
Crowned, in order as he set forth accordingly.

The King is to be received into the Church with an Anthem.

Protector noster.
Protector noster aspice Deus, and respice in faciem uncti tui, quia melior est
dies una in Atriis tuis super Millia. Quam dilecta, etc. Gloria patri, etc.
Behold O Lord, our Protector, and look upon the face of thine Anointed, because
one day in thy Court, is better then a thousand. Psalm. quam dilecta, etc. 84.
11. Gloria patri, etc.

The King passing up the body of the C^ch, and so through the Quire, goes up
the Stai^s u^ his Throne of Estate, and there r^poseth hi^lf.

The King set in his Throne, the Arc^bishop going to every of the four fides of
the Stage, viz. North, South, East and West, (the Marshall of England, going
before him to all the said places) asks the people if they be willing to
accept of the King as their Sovereign, that he may be Anointed and Crowned?
His verbis.

The people demanded if they be willing.
Sirs, here I present unto you King James, the rightful Inheritor of the Crown
of this Realm, wherefore all you that be come this day to do your homage,
service, and bounden duty, be ye willing to do the same?

Or thus,

Sirs, here present is James rightful and undoubted Nota.
Inheritor by the Laws of God and Man, to the Crown and Royal dignity of
England, with all things thereunto annexed and appertaining, elect, chosen and
required by all three Esta^es of this same Land, to take upon him this said
Crown and Royal dignity, whereupon you shall understand that this day is fixed
and appointed by all the Peers of the Land, for the consecration, enunction and
Coronation of the said most excellent Prince James. Will you serve him at this
time, and give your wills and assents to the same Consecration, E^ction, and
Coronation?

Or thus,

Will you take this worthy Prince James, right Heir of the Realm, and have him
to your King, and become Subjects to him, and submit your selves to his
Commandments?

This while, the King standing up, turns himself to every of the four sides,
as the Archbishop is at every of them speaking to the people.

The people signifying their willingness, by answering all in one voice, Yea,
Yea, God save King James. The Quire sings the Anthem.

Firmetur manus.
Firmetur manus tua, and exaltetur dextra tua justitia and judicium pr^paratio
sedis tuae, Misericordia and veritas precedent faciem tuam, Alleluiah.

Firmetur manus tua.
Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand be exalted. Let Justice and
Judgment be the preparation ^f thy Seat, and Mercy and Truth go before thy
Face. Alleluia Ps. misericordias Dei. Glory be to the Father, etc.

While the Quire sings the Anthem, the Archbishop goes down to the Altar,
and revesteth himself there.

The Archbishop being there ready, the King, supported by the two Bishops, (as
before) and attended by the Abbot of Westminster, goes down from his Throne to
the Altar.

The Kings Offering, and the Sermon.
There he makes his first Oblation, which is, Pallium ^nm, and una libra auri.

After the King has Offered, he kneeleth down at his Fald-stool.

The Archbishop says the Prayer.

Deus humilium.
Deus humilium visitator, qui nos Sancti Spiritus illustratione consolaris,
pretend super hun^ famulum tuum Jacobum gratiam tuam, nt per eum, tuum in
nobis addesse sentiamus adventum per D^minum Christum nostrum, etc.

Deus visitator humilium.
O God which do visit those that are humble, and do comfort us, by the
light of thy Holy Spirit, send down thy Grace upon this thy Servant James, that
by him we may feel thy presence amongst us, through Jesus Christ.

Then does the Sermon begin, which the King hears in his Chair of Estate by
the Altar on the South side of it.

The Sermon being done, the Archbishop goes to the King, and a^keth his
Majesty concerning his willingness to take the Oath, usually taken by his
Predece^ors.

The King (showing himself willing therewithal) arises and comes to the
Altar.

The Archbishop ministers the three first questions, and the King answers
them severally. Scilic^.

1 Quaestio.
Si leges and consuetudines ab antiquis justis and Deo devotis Regibus, Flebi
Anglorum concessas, cum sacrame^ confirmatione eidem Plebi concedere and
servare voluerit, and praesertim leges consuetudines and libertates a glorioso

Sequitur admonitio Episcoporum ad Regem, and legatur ab (...) Episcopo coram

nobis commissis, Canonicum Privilegium ac debitam legem atque justitiam
conservetis, and defensionem exhibeatis, ^ut Rex in suo regno debet, unicuique

and Ecclesiis vobis commissis Canonicum Privilegium and debitam legem atque
justitiam Servabo, and defensionem quantum potuero, adjuvante Domino, Exhibebo,
^cut Rex in suo Regno unicuique Episcopo and Ecelesiis sibi commissis quod

This done the King (...) to the observation of what he has promised them upon
the Altar.

After the O^th thus taken, the King returns to his Chair of Estate ag^in.

The Archbishop begins the Hymn, Veni Creator spiritus, and the Quire sing
it.

The Hymn ended, the King kneels down at his Faldstool, and the Archbishop
says the Prayer, Te invocamus, etc.

Te invocamus Domine.
Te invocamus Domine sanct^, Pater Omnipotens eterne Deus, ut hunc famulum tuum
Jacobum, quem tuae divinae dispensationis providentia in primordio Plasmatum
usque hunc praesentem diem Juvenili flore letantem crescere concessisti; eum
tuae Pietatis done ditatum, plenumque gratia veritatis de die in diem coram Deo
and hominibus ad meliora semper proficere f^cias, ut summi regiminis solium,
gratiae supernae largitate gaudens suscipiat: Et misericordiae tuae muro ab
hostium adversitate undique munitum. Plebem sibi commissam cum pace
propitiationis and virtute victoriae feliciter regere mereatur, per Jesum
Christum.

We beseech thee, O Lord holy Father, almighty and everlasting God, for this
thy servant James, that as at the first thou broughtest him into the world by
thy Divine Providence, and in the flower of his youth, have preserved him
until this present day, so thou will evermore enrich him with the gift of
piety, fulfill him with the grace of truth, and increase him daily in all
goodness in the sight of God and men, that he may joyfully receive the seat of
supreme Government, by the gift of thy supernal Grace; and being defended from
all his Enemies, by the wall of thy Mercy, he may happily govern the people
committed to his charge.

After the prayer done, begins the Letany to be sung by two Bishops. Vel duo
Cantores. Infra Letaniam haec adjungantu^. Ut praesentem famulum tuum in tua
pietate, Justicia and sanctitate confirmare and conservare digneris, te rogamus
audi nos. P^stea sequantur hae orationes.

Omnipotens sempiterne Deus creator omnium Imperatorum, angelorum Rex
regnantium, Dominusque Dominantium, qui Abraham fidelem famulum tuum de
hostibus triumphare fecisti; Moysi and Josuae populo Praelatis multiplicem
victoriam tribuisti; humilemque David puerum tuum Regni fastigio sublimasti.
Salomonem Sapientiae, pacisque ineffabili munere ditasti. Respice nos ad preces
humilitatis nostrae, and super hunc famulum tuum quem supplici devotione in
Regem consecramus Benedictionum tuarum dona multiplica eumque dextrae tuae
potenti^ semper and ubique cir^da, quatenus pr adicti Abrahae fide firmatus,
Moysis (...) (...) fretus, Josuae fortitudine munitus. Davidi humilitate (...).
(...) sapi^ decoratus, Tibi in omnibus placeat. Et per tramitem justitiae
inoffenso gressu semper incedat. (...) tuam deinceps cum Plebibus sibi (...) ut
enutriat ac (...), muniat and instruat. Contraque omnes visibiles and inv^biles
hosts (...) potenter regaliterque virtutis regimen administret, Et ad verae
fidei pacisque Concordiam eorum animos (te opitu^nte) reformet, ut horum
populorum debita subjectione fultus, cum digno amore glorificatus, ad paternum
decenter solium tua miseratione concendere mereatur. Tuae quoque protectionis
galea munitus, and scuto insuperabili jugiter protectus, armisque ^ibus
circundatus, optabilis victoriae triumphum feliciter ^piat, terrorem que suae
potentiae infidelibus inferat, Et pacem in militantibus letanter reportet per
Dominum nostrum qui virtute Crucis Tartara destruxit, regnoque diaboli
superacto, ad Coelos victor ascendit, in quo potestas omnis regum consistit and
victoria, qui est gloria humilium and vita salusque Popnlorum, qui tecum vivit.
Amen.

O Almighty and everlasting God, Creator of all things, Ruler of Angels, King
of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who did cause thy faithful servant Abraham to
triumph over his enemies; did give many victories to Moses, and (...), the
Governors of thy people, did exalt thy lowly servant David, unto the height
of a Kingdom; did enrich Solomon with the unspeakable gift of Wisdom and
Peace. Give ear we beseech thee unto our humble Prayers, and multiply thy
blessing upon this thy Servant, whom in lowly devotion we do consecrate our
King; that he being strengthened with the Faith of Abraham, endued with the
Mildness of Moses, armed with the For^itude of Joshua, exalted with the
humility of David, beautified with the Wisdom of Solomon, he may ^lease thee
in all things, he may always walk uprightly in the way of Righ^, he may
nourish and teach, defend and instruct thy Church and people, and like a mighty
King, minister unto them the government of thy Ver^e against all enemies
visible and invisible, and by thy help reform their minds to the concord of
true Faith and peace, that being underpropped by the due Obedience, and
honored by the condign Love of these his people, he may, by thy mercy royally
ascend up to the throne of his forefather, and being defend^d with the Helmet
of thy protection, covered with thy invincible shield, and al^ clad with
heavenly Armor, he may gloriously triumph, and by his power both terrify
infidels, and bring joyful peace to those that fight for thee, through our
Lord, who by the power of his Cross has destroyed Hell, and having overthrown
the Kingdom of the Devil, is with victory ascended into Heaven, in whom does
consist all Power, Kingdom and Victory, who is the glory of the humble, the
life and salvation of his people, who lives with thee and the holy Ghost.

Benedic domine, etc. hunc Regem nostrum Jacobum, qui regna moderaris a seculo,
and tali eum benedictione glorifica, ut Davidis toneat sublimitas sceptrum and
glorificatus in ejus te propitio reperiatur merito. Da ei tuo inspiramine (...)
mansuetudine ita regere Populum sicut Salomonem fecisti reg^um obtinere
pacificum. Tibi cum timore semper sit subditus, tibique militet cum quiet. Sit
tuo Clipeo protectus cum Proceribus, and ubique tua gratia major existat.
Honorifica eum prae cunctis regibus Gentium. Felix populis dominetur, and
feliciter eum Nationes adorent. Vivat inter gentium Catervas magnanimus. Sit in
judiciis aequitatis singularis. Locuplet eum tua pr ^dives dextera frugiferam
obtineat patriam. Et ejus libris tribuis profutura Praesta ei prolixitatem
vitae per tempora, ut in diebus ejus oriatur justitia. A te robustum teneat
regiminis solium, and eum Jocunditate and Justitia (...) glorietur in regno.
Amen.

O Lord, thou that governest all Kingdoms from everlasting, bless we beseech
thee this our King, that he may rule like ' David, and by thy mercy obtain his
reward. Grant that by thy inspiration he may govern with the mildness of
S^lomon, and enjoy a peaceable Kingdom. Grant that he may serve thee with
fear, and fight for thee with constancy. Protect him and his Nobles with thy
Shield, and always give him victory by thy Grace. Honor him before all the
Kings of the earth; Let him rule over Countries, and let Nations adore him. Let
him be singular in Judgment and Equity, and make him rich with thy rich right
hand. Give him a fruitful Country, and give to his Children all good things.
Give him a long life in this world, and in his days let Justice flourish.
Strengthen thou the throne of his Government, and with gladness and
righteousness, let him glory in thy eternal Kingdom, through Jesus Christ.

Deus in^ffabilis author mundi, Conditor generis humani, Gubernator imperii
Confirmator, regni, qui utero fidelis amici tui Patriarchae nostrae Abrahae
praeelegisti Regem seculis profuturum. Tuum presentem Regem hunc cum exercitu
suo per in^rcessionem omnium Sanctorum uberi benedictione locupleta, and in
solium Regni firma stabilitate connecte visita eum sicut Moysem in Rubro,
Josuam in Praelio, Gedeon in agro Samuelem in templo. Et illa eum benedictione
syderia, ac sapientiae tu^ rorae perfunde, quantum beatus David in Psalterio,
Solomon filius ejus, te remunerante precepit e coelo. Si^ ei contra acies
Inimicorum lorica, in adversis galea, in prosperis patientia, in protectione
Clipeus sempeternus, and presta ut gentes illi teneant fidem. Proceres sui
habeant pacem, diligant Caritatem, abstineant se a cupiditate, loquantur
justitiam, custodiant veritatem. Et ita populus iste pullulet coalitus
benedictione aeternitatis ut semper permaneant tripudiantes in pace victores,
per Christum Dominum nostrum, etc.

God the unspeakable Author of the World, the Creator of Mankind, the Governor
of Empires, the Establisher of Kingdoms, who out of the loins of thy
faithful friend our Father Abraham, did choose a King that should save all
Nations. Bless we beseech thee this our present King, and his Army with a rich
blessing. Establish him in the throne of this Kingdom. Visit him, as thou
did visit Moses in the Bush, Josua in the Battle, Gedeon in the Field, and
Samuel in the Temple; besprinkle him with the dew of thy Wisdom, and give unto
him the blessing of David and Solomon. Be thou unto him a coat Armor against
his Enemies, and an Helmet in adversity. Give him patience in Prosperity, and
protect him always with thy Shield. Grant that other Countries may keep Faith
unto him, and that his Nobles may live in Peace, embrace Charity, abstain from
Covetousness, speak Justice and maintain Truth; and so this people may grow up
together with the blessing of ^ity, that having overcome, they may rejoice in
everlasting peace, through Christ our Lord.

Deus qui populus tuis virtute consuli^, and amore dominaris, da huic famulo
tuo Jacobo spiritum (...), cum regimine disciplinae, ut tibi toto cord dev^ in
regni regimine maneat semper idoneus, tuoque munere ipsius temporibus securitas
Ecclesiae dirigatur, and in tranquillitate devotio Christiana perma^, ut bonis
operibus perseverans ad aeternum regnum te duce valeat pervenire, per Dominum
Jesum Chri^, etc.

God which providest for thy people by thy Power, and rulest over them in Love,
(...) unto this thy Servant James, the spirit of Wisdom and Government, that
being devoted unto thee with all his heart, he may so wisely govern this
Kingdom, that in his time the Church may be in (...), and Ch^n Devotion may
continue in peace, that so persevering to the end in good works, he may by thy
mercy come unto thine everlasting Kingdom, through thy Son our Lord Jesus
Christ, who lives and reigns with thee world without end. Amen.

The Letany being ended, the Archbishop begineth to say aloud,

Sursum Corda.

Resp.

Habemus ad Dominum.

Lift up your Hearts, etc.

Answ.

We lift them up unto the Lord.

Vere dignum and justum est aequum and salutare, os tibi semper and ubique
gratias agere, domine sancte, pater omnipotens, eterne Deus, electorum
fortitudo and humilium celsitudo, qui in primordio per effusionem diluvii
Crimina mundi castigare voluisti, and per Columbam ramum olivae portantem pacem
terris redditam demonstrasti. Iterumque Aaron famulum tuum per unctionem olei
sacerdotem sanxisti, and postea per hujus unguenti infusionem ad Regendum
populum Israeliticum sacer^es ac Reges and prophetas praefecisti, vultumque
Ecclesiae in oleo exhiler andum per Prophaeticam famuli tui vocem Davidi esse
praedixisti. Ita quaesumus omnipot^ Pater ut per hujus creaturae pinguedinem
hunc servum t^um Jacobum sanctificare tua benedictione digneris, eumque in
similicudine Columbae pac^m simplicitatis populo sibi subdito praestare, and
exemplo Aaronis in Dei servicio diligenter imitari, regnique fastigia in
Consiliis scientiae and aequitate judicii semper assequi, vultumque hilaritatis
per hunc olei unction^m tuamque benedictionem (te adjuvante) Toti Plebi paratum
habere facia^ per Christum Dominum nostrum, etc.

It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should at all times, and
in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord, holy Father, Almighty and
everlasting God, the strength of thy Chosen, and the exalter of the Humble,
which in the beginning, by the beginni^g out of the Flood (...) (...) the (...)
of the world, and by a D^ve conv^ying an Olive b^nch, did^ give a token of
reconcile (...) (...) (...) (...) and ag^in did^ consec^te thy ser^ Aaron a
P^est by the anoy^ing of (...) and (...) by the (...) of this Oil, did^ make
Priests, and Kings, and Prophets, to govern thy (...) (...), and by the voice
of the (...) David, ^idst (...) the the (...) of (...) Church shou^ be m^de
cheerful (...) Oil. We beseech thee almighty Father, that thou (...) (...) to
bless and ^tifie this thy Serv^nt (...) (...) he (...) minister Peace unto his
people, and (...) Aaron in the service of God. That he may attain the ^ection
of Government in Counsel and (...), (...) a (...) always cheerful, and amiable
to the whole people, through Christ our Lord.

This done the King arises from his Devotion, and reposeth him a while in his
chair of Estate.

After a while, he goes to the Altar, and there disrobeth himself of his upper
garments (his under apparel being made open with loops only closed) at the
places which are to be anointed.

The Archbishop undoeth the loops, and opens the places which he is to anoint.

The Archbishop first anoynteth his hands: saying,

Unguantur manus etc. istae de (...) (...) unde uncti fuerunt Reges and proph^.
(...) (...) (...) (...) (...), ut sis benedictus and (...) (...) in (...) (...)
(...) (...) istum quem Dominus Deus (...) (...) (...) and gubernandum; Quod
ipse prestare (...) (...) (...) (...) and Spiritu sancto, etc.

Let these hands be anoyn^d, as (...) and P^phets have been anoyn^ed, and as
Samuel (...) (...) (...) to be King, that thou may be blessed, and (...)
(...) a King in this Kingdom over this people, whom the Lord thy God has
given thee to rule and govern, which he vouch^ to grant, who with the Father
and the holy Ghost, etc.

The mean while the Quire sings the Anthem, Sadoc. Sacerdo.

Sadock the (...) and N^than the Prophet, anointed Solom^ King, and all the
people rejoiced, and said, God save the King for ever.

The Arch^op says this prayer.

Prospice omnipotens Deus serenibus obtutibus hunc gloriosum Regem, and sicut
benedixisti Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, sic illum largis benedictionibus
spiritualis gr^iae cum omni plenitudine tua po^entia irrigare atque perfundere
dignare. Tribue ei de rore coeli and de pinguedine terrae habundantiam frumenti
vini, and olei, and omnium frugum opulentiam ex largitate divini muneris longa
per tempora, ut illo regnante sit sanitas corporum in patria, and pax inviolata
sit in regno, and dignitas gloriosa regalis Palla^ maximo splendore Regiae
potestatis oculis omnium fulgeat, luce Clarissima choruscare atque splendescere
qui splendidi^ fulgura maximo profusa lumine videatur. Tribue ei Omnipotens
Deus, ut sit for^ssimus protector patriae, and Consolator ^siarum ac
Coenobiorum sanctorum, maxima cum pietate regalis munificentiae, atque ut sit
fortissimus regum triumphator, hostium ad opprimendas rebels, and paganas
(...). Sitque suis inimiciis satis terribilis pro maxima fortitudine regalis
potentiae. Optimatibu^ quoque atque praecelsis proceribus ac (...) sui regni
Munisicus and amabilis, and pius; Ut ab (...) timeatur atque deligatur. Reges

regere totum, and post gloriosa tempora atque faelicia praesentis vitae gaudia

Look down Almighty God with thy favorable countenance upon this glorious
King, and as thou did bless Abraham, Isa^ and Jacob, so vouchsafe we
beseech thee by thy (...), (...) water hi plen^fully with the blessings o^ thy
grace. (...) unto him of the dew of Heaven, and of the (...) of the Earth,
abundance of Corn, and Wine, and Oil, and plenty of all fruits of thy goodness
long to con^e, that in his time here may be health in our Coun^ey, and Peace in
our Kingdom, and that the glorious dignity of his Royal Court, may brightly
shine as a most clear lightning, far and wide in the eyes of all men. Grant
Almighty God, that he may be a most mighty protector of his Country, a
bountiful comforter of Churches and holy Societies, the most valiant of Kings,
that he may triumph over his enemies, and subdue Rebels and Infidels; that he
may be loving and amiable to the Lords and Nobles, and all the faithful
Subjects of his Kingdom, that he may be feared, and loved of all men, that his
Children may be Kings to rule this Kingdom by succession of all ages, and that
after the glorious Nota.
and happy days of this present life, he may obtain everlasting joy and
happiness through Christ our Lord.

The prayer ended, the Archbishop proceeds with his (...).

1. Of the Breast. 2. Between the Shoulders. 3. Of both the Shoulders. 4. Of
the boughs of both his arms. 5. Of his head in the Crown.
The anoy^ing being done, the Abbot of Westmi^ closes the loops again which
were opened.

The Archbishop says these prayers.

The King put^h ^n the Linen gloves (p^rt of the Regalia.)

Then he takes off his Sword, wherewith he was girt before.

He goes to the Al^ar, and (...) (...) it.

The chief Peer then present (...), and redeemeth the Sword,

Which having done, he draws the Sword out, and carries it naked before the
King, from that time all the solemnity.

The Arc^bishop takes the Scepter with the Cross, and delivers it into the
Kings right hand, with these words;

Accipe s^cptrum regiae potestatis insigne, virgam so^icet regni rect^m, virga^
virtu^, qua (...) been (...), (...) Eccles^m p^pulumque vid^licet Christianum
tibi (...) 'Domino commiss^m regia virtute ab improbis def^dat, pravos
corrigas, rectos (...) and ut viam rectam (...) poss^t tuo (...) (...), (...)

Receive the Scepter, the sign of Kingly power, the Rod of the Kingdom, the
Rod of Virtue, that thou m^ist govern thy sel^ aright, and d^nd the holy Church
and Christian people committed by God unto thy charge. Punish the wicked, and
protect the just, and lead them in the way of righreousnesse, that from this
Temporal kingdom, thou mai^ be advanced to an Eternal kingdom, by his
goodness whose kingdom is everlasting.

After the Archb^shop says this prayer.

Omnium Domine fons bonorum, cunctorumque Deus institutorum perfectuum, tribue
quaesumns famulo tuo Jacobo adeptam been regere dig^atem, and a te sibi
praestitum honorem dign^re corroborare. Honorifica eum (...) regibus, uberi eum
benedictione locupleta, and in solio regni firma stabili^te consolida; visita
eum sobole, praesta eum prolixitatem vitae. In diebus ejus semper ^riatur
Justitia, ut cum ^ecunditate and (...) (...) glorietur in regno.

O Lord the Fountain of all good things, and the author of all good
proceedings, grant we beseech thee to this thy servant James, that he may order
aright the dignity he has o^tained. Vouchsafe to confirm the honor which thou
have given him, honor him before all Kings, and ^rich him with a rich
benediction; establish him in the throne of this Realm; visit him with increase
of Children, let justice spring up in his days, and with joy of gladness, let
him reign in thine everlasting kingdom.

Then the Archbishop delivers the Rod with the Dove into the Kings left hand,
saying.

Accipe virgam virtutis atque aeq^atis, qua intelligas te mulcere pios, and
terrere superbos, Errantes ^iam doce, Lapsisque manum porrige, (...) superbos
and releves humiles, ut aperiat tibi est^um Josus Christus dominus noster, qui
de se ipso ait; Ego sum ostium per me si quis introierit s^lvabitur. Et ipse
qui est clavis D^vid and Sc^um domus Israel, qui aperit, and nemo cl^udit,
claudit and nemo aperit, sit tibi adjutor, qui educit vinctum de domo Carceris,
sedentem in t^nebris and umbra mortis, ut in omnibus sequi merearis eum de quo
Propheta David cecinit, Seeds tua Deus in seculum seculi, virga recta est virga
regni tui, and imitare ipsum qui dicit. Diligas justitiam and odio habeas
iniquitatem, propterea un^it te Deus Deus tuu^ oleo laetitiae ad exemplum i^us,
quem ante secula unxerat prae particibus suis, Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum,
etc.

Receive the Rod of virtue and equity, Learn to make much of the godly, and to
terrify the wicked, Show the way to those that go astray. Offer thy h^nd to
those that fall. Repress the pro^d. Lift up the Lo^vly, that our Lord Jesus
Christ may open to thee the door, who says of himself, I am the door, b^ me if
any man enter in he shall be safe; and let him be thy helper, who is the key of
David and the Scepter of the house of Israel, who opens and no man shuts,
who shuts and no man opens, who brings forth the captive out of prison,
where he sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, that in all things thou
may follow him of whom the Prophet David says, Thy seat O God endures for
ever, the Scepter of thy Kingdom is (...) right Scepter, thou have loved
righ^eousness, and hated iniquity: Where^ore God even thy God has anointed
thee with the oil of gladness above thy Fellows, even Jesus Christ our Lord.

After this he blesses the King, saying.

Benedicat tibi, etc. Dominus (...) t^, and (...) t^ voluit (...) (...) suum
esse Regem. (...) in (...) seculo f^licem and (...) (...) (...) esse (...). ^
(...).

The Lord (...) and keep ^hee and ^s ^e has m^de thee King (...) his people,

Gran^ O Lord that the Clergy and People gathered together by (...) (...) ^or

Citizens of thy Kingdom in the life that is to come, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.

The King kisseth the Archbishop, and the Bishops then Assistant.

After this, the King goes up from the Altar to the Stage (all the Peers
solemnly attending his Majesty in their places.)

In the mean time the Quire sing; (...) de^m (...) etc.

Which being ended, the Archbishop (...) the King into his throne there: a^ying,

Sta and retine a modo l^cum, (...) (...) usque (...) (...) tenuisti (...)

Plebis in hoc regni Solio confirmet, and in regnum aeternum regnare faciat
Jesus Christus Dominus noster, Rex R^gum and Dominus Dominantium, qui cum patre
and spiritu sancto vivit, and regnat in secula seculorum. Amen.

Stand and hold fast from henceforth, that place whereof hitherto tho^ have
been heir by the succession of thy forefathers, being now delivered unto thee,
by the authority of Almighty God, and by the ^nds of Us, and all the Bishops
and Servants of God; and as thou see the Clergy to come nearer unto the
Altar, so remember that in places convenient thou give them greater honour^
that the mediator of God and Man may establish thee in this Kingly throne, to
be the mediator betwixt the Clergy and the Laity, and that thou may reign
for ever with Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords, who with
the Father and the holy Ghost, ^veth and reigns for ever. Amen.

Which done, all the Peers do their homage to the King. His verbis.

I become your Leige-man of Life and Limb, and of Carthly Worship, and Faith
and ^eoth shall bear unto you, to live and dye with you against all manner of
folk. So God me help.

And after, put their hands and touch the Crown (by way of ceremony, as
promising to ^upport it with all their power.)

Then the King to ease himself of (...) (...) Rod in his (...), gives them to
carry to such as it (...) his Majesty.

The Archbishop kneeled down, and made his Hom^ge as follows,

Out of the Coronation of Edward the 6.
J. A. Shall be faithful and true, and Faith and Troth bear unto you our
Sovereign Lord, and to your Heirs Kings of England, and I shall do and truly
knowledge the service due of the Lands I claim to hold of you, as in the right
of your Church, as God shall help me.

And so kissed the Kings left cheek, etc.
Or these words taken out of another book.
I become your man Liege of life and Limb, and Troth and hearty Honor to you
shall bear, against all men that now live and dye. So help me God, etc.

The A^chbishop goes down to the Altar, and begins the Communion.

The Prayer. Quaesumus omnipotens, etc.
Quaesumus omnipotens Deus, ut ^amulus tuus Jacobus Rex noster, qui tua
miseration^ suscepit Regni guberna^ula, virtutum etiam omnium percipiat
incrementa. Quibus decenter ornatus; and vitiorum voraginem devitare, and
hosts superare, and ad te qui veritas and vita es gratiosus v^leat pervenire,
per Dominum Iesum nostrum. Amen.

O Almighty God, w^ beseech thee that this thy Servant James our King, who by
thy mercy has received the government of this Realm, may also receive an
increase of all Virtues, whereby he may be acceptable to thee, and avoid the
gulf of vice, and overcome all his enemies, and finally come ^o thee in glory,
who art the Way the Truth, and the Life, thorough Christ our Lord.

The Epistle, 1 Pet. 2. By two Bishops. The Gospel, Matthew. 22. By two Bishops.
The Nicene Creed. The Offertory.
The King comes down from the Throne to offer.

He offers twice.

1. Bread and Wine. 2. A Mark of Gold.
Then the Prayer, Omnipotens Deus, etc.
Omnipotens Deus det tibi de rore coeli and de pinguedine terrae habund^ntiam
srumenti, vini and olei, and serviant tibi populi, and ad^rent te tribus. Esto
Dominus fratrum tuorum, and incurventur ante to filii matris tuae, and qui
benedixerit tibi benedictionibus repleatur, and Deus erit ^djutor tuus. Opus
benedicaet tibi benedictionibus coeli desuper in montibus, and in Collibus
benedictionibus abyssi jacentibus deorsum, benedictionibus uberum, and uvarum
Pom^rumque, benedictiones Patr^m antiquorum Abraham and Isa^c and Jacob
confortatae sint super te.

Almighty God, give thee of the dew of Heaven, and of the fat of the Earth,
abundance of Corn and Wine. Let the Nations serve thee, and the Tribes ado^e
thee, and let him be blessed that blesses thee, and God shall be thy helper.
Almighty God, bless you with the blessing of Heaven above, in the Mountains
and Hills, and with the blessings of the Earth beneath, with the blessings of
Corn and Wine, and Fruit, and let the blessings of the old Fathers, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, be established upon thee, through Christ our Lord.

Bless O Lord, the virtuous cou^age of this King, and accept the work of his
hands^ replenish his Realm with the increase of thy Blessings, with the fruit
of the Heavens, and the dew of the Water, and the depths. Let the influence of
the Sun and the Moon, drop down fatness upon the high Mountains, and the
Clouds rain plenty upon the low Valleys, that the Earth may abound with store
of all things. Let the blessings of him that appeared in the Bush^ descend upon
his head, and the fullness of his blessings fall upon his Children and
posterity. Let his Feet be dipped in Oil, and his horn be exalted, as the hor^
of an Unicorn by which he may scatter his enemies from on the sace of the
Earth; the Lord that sits in Heaven be his defender for ever and ever,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Bl^sse we beseech thee, O Lord, these thy gifts, and fanctifie them unto this
holy use, that by them we may be made partakers of the Body and Blo^d of thy
only begotten Son Jesus Christ. And thy servant our King James may be sed unto
everlasting life of Soul and Body, and enabled to the discharge of his great
place and osfice, where^nto thou have called him of thy great goodness: grant
this O Lord for Jesus Christ's sake our only mediator and advocate. Amen.

Deus Rex Regum, and dominus domina^tium per quem Reges regnant, and legum
^onditores ^ura (...) dignare (...) benedicere ^ic reg^le ornamen^um, and
presta ut famulus tuus Rex noster qui (...) (...) orna^ento bonorum morum and
sanctarum (...) in conspectu tu^ sulgeat, and post te^pora alieni vitam (...)
and glori^m quod tempus non habet ^ine fine possideat, per Dominum nostrum, etc.

O God the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords by whom Kings do rei^n, and
Lawgivers do make good Laws, (...) in thy favor to bless this Kingly
ornament, and gr^nt that thy servant our King, who shall wear it, may shine in
the spirit, with the ornament of good life, and holy actions, and after this
life ended, he may forever enjoy that life, and glory which has no end,
through Christ our Lord.

The prayer done, the Abbot of Westminster arrayeth the King.

1. With the supertunica, or close Pall. 2. Then with the Tynsin hose. 3. Then
with his Sandalls.
The Spurs are put on by a Nobleman, thereto by the King appointed.

Then the Archbishop takes the Sword, and lays it before him on the Altar,
and s^ith the Prayer, Exaudi Domine, etc.

Quaesumus, Domin^ preces nostras, and hunc ensem quo ^ic famulus tuus Jacobus
se circumcingi desiderat, majestatis (...) dextera benedicere and (...)
dignare, quatenus defenfio atque protectio eccle^iarum esse, viduarum
Orphanorum omniumque Deo Servientium contra saevitiam paganorum, (...)
insidiantibu^ sit pavor, terror and formido, per Dominum nostrum etc.

Hear our prayers, we beseech thee, and vouchsafe by thy right hand of majesty,
to bless and sanctify this Sword, wherewith this thy servant James desires
to be girt, that it may be a defense, and protection of Churches, Widows,
Orphans, and all the Servants of God, against the savage cruelty of Pagans and
Infidels; and that it may be a fe^r and terror to all those that lie in wait to
do mischief, through Christ our Lord.

Then the Archbishop delivers the Sword into the Kings hands, saying, Accipe
gladium. Which Sword is girt about him by a Peer thereto appointed.

Accipe gladium per manus Episcoporum licet indignas, vice cum and auth^ritate
sanctorum Apostolorum consecratas, tibi regaliter impositum, nostraeque
benedictionis ^fficio in defensiouem, sanctae fidei Ecclesiae divinitus
ordinatum. Et ^sto memor de quo Psalmista prophetavit dicens. Accingere gladio
tuo super femur tuum potentissime, ut per eundem vim aequitatis exerceas molem
iniquitatis pote^er destruas, and sanctam Dei Ecclesiam ejusque fideles
propugnando protegas. Non minus sub fide falsos quam Christiani nominis hosts
execreris ac destruas, viduas and pupillos clementer adjuves ac defendas,
desolata restaures, restaurata conserves, ulciscaris injusta, Confirms been
disposita, quatenus haec in agendo virtutum triumpho gloriosus. Justitiaeque
cultor egregius cum mundi salvatora, cujus typu^ geris in nomine sine fine
merearis reg^are. Qui cum patre and ^piritu Sancto, etc.

Receive this Kingly Sword ( which is hallowed) for the defense of the Faith of
Christ's holy Church, and delivered unto thee by the hands of Bishops, though
unworthy, yet Consecrated, in the place of the holy Apostles; and remember of
whom the Psalmist did prophet, saying, Gird thy self with thy Sword upon thy
Thigh, O thou most mighty; and with this Sword, exercise thou the force of
Equity, and mightily destroy the growth of Iniquity; protect the holy Church of
God, and his faithful people, and pursue Heretics, no less then Infidels,
defend and help Widows, and Orphans. Restore the things that are gone to
decay, and maintain those things that are restored, be revenged of injustice,
and confirm things that are in good order, that doing these things thou may
be glorious in the triumph of Virtue, and excellent in the ornament of Justice,
and reign for ever with the Savior of the world, whose image you bear, who
with the Father and the Holy ghost.

Then the Armill is pu^ about his neck (in the manner of a Stole) and tied to
the boughts of his two Arms.

The Archbishop saying;

Accipe armillas sinceritatis, and sapientiae divinaeque circumdationibus
judicium, quibus intelligas omnes operationes tuas contra hosts visibiles, and
invisibiles posse esse munitas, per Dominum nostrum, etc.

Recive the Armill, as a token of Gods embracing, whereby all thy works may be
defended against thy enemies, both bodily and ghostly, through Christ our Lord.

Then the Mantle or open Pall is put on by the Abbor of Westminster.

The Archbishop saying,

Accipe pallium, quatuor initiis formatum, per quod intelligas quatuor mundi
parts Divinae potestati esse subjecta^. Nec quenquam posse feliciter regnare
i^ terris, nisi cui potestas regnandi fuerit collocata de Coelis.

Receive this Pall which is formed with four Corners, to let thee understand,
that the four quarters of the world, are subject to the power of God, and that
no man can happily reign upon Earth, who has not received his authority from
Heaven;

Then the Archbishop takes the Crown into his han^s, and says this prayer.

Deus perpetuatis, Du^ virtutum cunctarum, hostium victor, benedic hunc famulum
tuum Jacobum, tibi caput suum inclinantem, and prolixa sanitate, and prospera
felicitate eum conserva, and ubicunque auxilium tuum invocaverit, cito adsis,
and protegas ac defenda^. Tribue ei quaesumus domine divitia^ gratiae tuae^
comple in bonis desiderium e^us, corona eum in misericordia tua, tibique domino
opia devotione jugiter famuletur, per Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum filium etc.

O God of Eternity, the commander of all Powers, the vanquisher of all Enemies,
bless this thy servant, who boweth his head unto thy Majesty, preserve him in
long health, and prosperous felicity, be present with him, pro^ect and defend
him, whenever he calls upon thee. Give him, we beseech thee, the riches of
thy Grace, fill his soul with goodness, and crown him with thy mercy, and let
him always in godly devotion wait upon thee, through thy Son our Lord Jesus
Christ.

The Archbishop Crowns the King, saying:

Coronet te Deus cor^na Gal^aque justi^iae, honor and opere fortitudinis, ut
per officium nostrae benedictionis cum fide recta, and multiplici bonoram
operum fructu ad Coronam pervenias regni perp^. Ipse largiente, cujus reg^um
permanet in secula seculorum.

God Crown thee with a Crown of Glory, and Righteousness, with the honor, and
work of Fortitude, that thou by ou^ Ministry, having a right Faith, and
manifold fruit of good works, ^aist obtain the Crown of an everlasting
kingdom, by the gift of him whose kingdom ind^eth for ever.

In the mean time the Quire sings the Anthem.

Confortare.
Be strong and os a good courage, and observe the Commandem^ of the Lord, to
walk in his ways and keep his Ceremonies, Precepts, Testimonies and
Judgments, and almighty God prosper and strengthen thee whithersoever thou
go. The Lord is my Ruler, therefore I shall want nothing.

Deus in virtute.
The King shall rejoice in my strength, O Lord, exceeding ^ ^ ^ ^.

Then he puts the Ring on his Wedding finger: saying,

Accipe regiae dignitatis a^nulum, and per hun ^e Catholicae fidei signaculum,
quatenus ut hodie ornaris ^aput, and Princeps regni ac Populi, ita perseveres
auctor and stab^ Christianitatis, and Christianae fidei, ut felix in opere,
locuples in fide cum rege Regum glorieris Cui est honor and gloria per aeterna
secula seculorum. Amen.

Receive the Ring of Kingly dignity, and by it the seal of Christian Faith,
that as this day thou art adorned the head and Prince of this Kingdom and
People, so thou may persevere as the Author and establisher of Christianity,
and the Christian Faith, that being rich in Faith, and happy in Works, thou
may reign with him who is King of Kings, to whom be glory and honor for ever
and ever.

After this the Archbishop says this prayer:

Deus cujus est, etc. omnis potestas, and dignitas, da f^mulo tuo, propriae
suae dignitatis effectum in qua te remunerante permaneat, semperque te timeat
tibique jugiter placere contendat, per Dominum nostrum, etc.

O God, to whom belongs all Power and Dignity, give unto thy Servant the
Fruit of his Dignity, wherein grant he may long continue and fear ^ee always,
and always labor to please thee, through Christ our Lord.

The King comes to the Step of the Altar, to receive the Sacrament.

The Archbishop ministers the Bread.

The Abbot of Westminster the Cup.

The King returns to his Throne, and there staieth the end of Service.

The Communion being done, the King comes down in Estate to the Altar.

Thence into King Edwards Chapel.

The King takes off his Crown, and delivers it to the Archbishop, who
^aieth^ it on the Altar there.

The King withdraws himself into the Traverse.

There the great Chamberlain of England, disrobeth him of the Robes of King
Edward the Confessor.

These Robes he immediately delivers to the Abbot of Westminster.

The King is arrayed with his own Royal Robes provided for his Majesty to wear
that day.

The King being newly arrayed, comes forth of the Traverse, and goes to King
Edwards Altar.

There the Archbishop puts on him the Crown which is provided for his
Majesty to wear that day.

The King takes again his Scepter with the Cross into his hand, and the Rod
with the Dove.

The King with his whole train, in most solemn manner, goes back to his
Palace, by the same way he came.

Dinner being done, and the King withdrawing himself, the Scepter which the
King carried in his h^nd, with the Rod (being the Regalia) are to be
re-delivered to the Abbot of Westminster again, to be kept as they have been.

Consecratio Reginae.
THE Queen must be supported by two Bishops, from the West door of the Church
of Westminster, etc.

The ^een must be anointed, etc. after the Homage done by the Lords, and the
Kings Coronation finished.

The Queen following the King down to the Altar, going before the Lords,

there shall be made on the left side of the Altar a Folding stool.

She shall ^it while the King be required for the keeping of the Customs, etc.
and that done, while Veni Creator is singing, and all the while the King is
anointing.

Dicetur ab Episcopo ad ingressum Ecclesiae, at the West door of Westminster
Church. This prayer.

Omnipotens sempiterne, etc.
O Almighty and everlasting God, the Fountain and Wellspring of all goodness,
which do not reject the frailty of the Woman, but rather do vouchsafe to
allow and choose it, and by choosing the weak things of the world, do
confound those things that are strong, which did sometime cause thy People to
triumph over a most cruel Enemy, by the hand of Judith a woman, give ear we
beseech thee to our most humble prayers, and multiply thy blessings upon this
thy servant, whom in all humble Devotion, we do consecrate our Queen. Defend
her always with thy mighty right hand, and with the Buckler of thy favor,
protect her on every side, that she may be able to overcome and triumph over
all her Enemies, both bodily and ghostly, and that with Sarah and Rebecca, Le^h
and Rachel, and other blessed and honorable Women, she may multiply and
rejoice in the fruit of her Womb, to the honor of the whole Kingdom, and the
good government of the holy Church of God, through Christ our Lord, who
vouchsafed to be born of a most pure Virgin, that he might visit and redeem the
world, who lives and reigns with thee, in unity of the holy Ghost, through
all ages world without end.

Another blessing of the Queen before the Nobles, to be said at the Altar
before she be anointed.

Deus qui solus, etc.
God which ^ely have immortality, and dwell in Light which cannot be
approached, whose Providence is never deceived, which have made all things that
are to come, and call those things that are not, as the things that are,
which castest down the Proud from their Seat, and do exalt the Humble and
Meek, we humbly beseech thy unspeakable mercy, that as for the good of the
people of the Jews, thou did deliver Queen Hester from Captivity, and did
bring her to the bed of King Assuerus, and the society of his Kindome; so for
the good of thy Christian Flock, thou will of thy mercy by our Ministry,
advance this thy Servant, to the most high and Royal company of our King, that
she continuing always in the chastity of Princely Wedlock, she may obtain the
Crown that is next unto Virginity, and may in all things, and above all things,
study always to please thee the living God, and by thy holy inspiration to
perform those things that are acceptable unto thee, through Christ our Lord,
Amen.

Here the Holy Oil shall be poured upon the Crown of her head in the manner of
a Cross.

The Queen is to be anointed two times, first in the forepart of her Head, the
Bishop saying these words;

In the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, let the anointing of
this Oil increase thy honor, and establish thee for ever and ever.

Secondly on her Breast, saying the same words;

In the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, let the anointing of
this Oil increase thy honor, and establish thee for ever and ever.

After the Anointing, this Prayer is to be said:

Omnipotens sempiterne Deus.
O Almighty and everlasting God, we beseech thee of thy Goodness, pour o^t
the spirit of thine abundant blessing, upon this thy servant, that as by the
Imposition of our Hands, she is this day Crowned Queen, so she may by thy
sanctification, continue always thy chosen and worthy Servant, that she may
never hereafter fall from thy Grace, through Christ our Lord.

Here the Ring must be given her, and put on the Forefinger of her Right hand,
the Bishop saying,

Accipe annulum.
Receive this Ring the Seal of a sincere Faith, that you may avoid all
infection of Heresy, and by the power of God compel barbarous Nations, and
bring them to the knowledge of the truth.

This Prayer must follow.

Deus cujus est.
God, to whom belongs all Power and Dignity, grant we beseech thee to this
thy Servant, by the sign of Christian Faith, prosperous success in this he^
honor, and that she may continue firm in the same, and endeavor always to
please thee, through Christ our Lord.

Then the blessing of the Crown.

Deus tuorum.
O God, the Crown of the Faithful, which do Crown their heads with precious
Stones. Bless and sanctify this Crown, that as the same is adorned with many
precious Stones, so thy Servant that wears the same, may of thy grace be
replenished with the manifold gifts of all precious virtues, through Christ our
Lord Amen.

Then the Crown is set upon her Head, the Bishop saying;

Accipe Coronam.
Receive the Crown of Glory, and the honor of Joy, that you may shine in
Righteousness, and be crowned with everlasting gladness.

This also.

Officio nostre.
Seeing you are by our Ministry solemnly Conseerated for our Queen, receive
the Crown of Royal excellency, which is placed upon your head by the Episcopal
hands of us, though unworthy, and as you are Crowned without, with Gold and
Pearl, so labor to be beautified within with the Gold of Wisdom, and the
Pearl of Virtue, that after this life ended, you may with the just Virgins,
decently meet the everlasting Bridegroom, our Lord Jesus Christ, and enter the
Kingly gate of the Heavenly Court, by his help, who with the Father, and the
Holy ghost, lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.

Then the Archbishop purteth the Scepter in her right hand, and a Rod of Gold
in her left hand, saying,

Omnium Domine.
O Lord the fountain of all good things, and the giver of all perfection, grant
unto thy servant, that she may order aright the high Dignity she has obtained,
and with good works establish the glory that thou have given her, through
Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then is the Queen carried back into the Throne, by the two bishops.

As she passes by the King she boweth to him.

She is placed in her Throne, and thus continues, until she come down with
the King, to offer and receive the Communion.

The Queen going with the King into Saint Edwards Chapel, puts off her
Crown there at the Altar, before which Altar she stays until the King has
made himself ready in the Traverse.

After they both put on their Crowns Imperial, and so go to the Palace.

The King Answers.
I do esteem your affections more then the Crowns of many Kingdoms, and will
by Gods assistance bestow my life for your defense, wishing to live no longer
then I may see this Kingdom flourish in all happiness.

Then kissing his Majesty's hands, they prepare all to go in their ranks as
they are appointed, toward the Church.

The Lion K. of Arms having an open Crown upon his Head, carries in his hand
the Vessel containing the sacred Oil. Two of his Brethren walk on either of his
hands one. The Trumpets sound, and so they march.

The Receiving of the King into the Church.
THe Archbishop and Bishops, with the Musicians From the New door.
of the Chapel are to meet the King at the Entry in Procession wise.

The King is received under a Canopy, supported by four Barons. Two Bishops
walk, one on his Majesty's one hand, and another upon the other. The Dean of
the Chapel is always by to inform the King of the Ri^es of the Solemnity, as
need shall be.

The King is received with an Anthem into the Church, Protector noster, etc.
Behold oh Lord our Protector, and look upon the face of thine Anointed, because
one day in Anthem ^.
thy Court, is better then a thousand etc. Quam dilecta, etc.

The King passing up the Church, goes to the Stage, and reposeth himself a
little.

The Regal Crown, Scepter, Sword, Great Seal, and Spurs are laid down on a
Taffel besides the Altar or Table. The sacred Oil is delivered by Lion K. of
Arms to the Dean of the Chapel, who brings it ^o the Archbishop, and he sets
the same on the Table.

Then the King comes down from the Stage, and the Sermon begins. Sermon.


Which ended, the King ascends again to the Stage, and sits down in the Chair
of State.

Then the Archbishop (the Marshal of Scotland going before him) goes to all
the Quarters of the Stage, and speaks to the People in these words;

Sirs, I do present unto you King Charles, the rightful and undoubted Inheritor
of the Crown and dignity of this Realm. This day is by the Peers of the
kingdom, appointed for his Coronation. And are you not willing to have him for
your King, and become subject unto him and his Commandments?

The King stands up in this time, and as the Archbishop goes from one part of
the Stage to another, turns himself that he may be seen of the People.

The People declare their willingness by their Acclamations, and Shouts,
crying, God save King Charles; or Let the King live.

Then is sung this Anthem, Firmetur manus tua, etc. Anthem 2.
Let thine Hands be strengthened, and thy right Hand be exalted, let Judgment
be the preparation of thy Seat, mercy and truth go before thy face. Hallelujah.
Psalm. 89. Misericordias Dei, etc. Glory be to the Father, etc.

Whilst the Anthem is singing the Archbishop goes down to the Altar or
Table, and rests there.

Then is the King supported by two Bishops, brought to He offered twenty pieces.
the Altar, and makes his Oblation; After which he kneels at his Fald-stool,
and the Archbishop says this Prayer;

Deus visitator humilium: O God who do visit those that are humble, and do
comfort them by thine Holy Spirit, send down thy Grace upon this thy Servant
King Charles, that by him we may feel thy presence amongst us, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Prayer ended the King sits down in his The Oath.
Chair, and the Archbishop goes unto him, and asks, if he be willing to take
the O^th appointed to be given at the Coronation of Kings? His Majesty
declaring his willingness, the Archbishop ministers the Questions following.

Archbishop. Sir, will you promise to serve Almighty God, and as every good
King in his Kingdom ought to do, maintain the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this
your Kingdom, against all Itheism, Profaneness, H^, Schism, or Superstition
whatsoever?


Rex. I promise faithfully so to do.


Archbishop. Sir, will you promise to rule this People subject to you, and
committed to your Charge, according to the Laws, Constitutions and Customs of
this your Kingdom, causing (as much as in you lies) Justice and Equity to be
ministered without partiality? And to endeavor the Peace of the Church of Christ
and all Christian People?


Rex. I grant, and promise so to do.


Archbishop. Sir, will you likewise promise to preserve the Rights and
Privileges of the Crown of Scotland?


Rex. I promise so to do.


Archbishop. Sir, We do also beseech you to grant and preserve unto us of the
Clergy, and to the Churches committed to our Charge all Canonical Privileges,
and that you will defend and protect us, as every good King ought in his
Kingdom to defend his Bishops, and the Churches that be under their Government?


The King answers.
With a willing heart I grant the same, and promise to maintain you and every
one of you with all the Churches committed to your charge, in your whole Rights
and Privileges, according to Law and Justice.

Then the King rising from his Chair is led to the Altar, where in sight of all
the people, laying his hands upon the Bible, he takes his Oath and says. All
the things which before I have promised, I shall observe and keep. ^o God me
help; and by the Contents of this Book.

After the Oath, the King returns to his Chair of State, and then is sung the
Hymn, Veni Creator, etc. Veni Creator.


The Hymn finished, the King kneeleth at his Foldstool, and the Archbishop
says this prayer.

We beseech thee O Lord, holy Father, almighty and everlasting God, for this
thy Servant King Charles, that as at the first, thou broughtest him into the
world by thy Divine Providence, and in the flower of his youth have preserved
him until this present time; So thou will evermore enrich him with the gift of
Piety, fill him with the grace of Truth, and daily increase in him all
goodness, that he may happily enjoy the seat of supreme Government, by the
gift of thy supernal grace. And being defended from all his Enemies, by the
Wall of thy mercy, may prosperously govern the people committed to his Charge.

After the Prayer, the Letany is sung, and at the close Letany.
thereof this is to be added.

That it may please thee to keep and strengthen in the true Worshipping of thee,
in Righteousness and Holiness of life, this thy servant Charles, our King and
Governor, and so to the end.

Then is said this prayer by one of the Bishops that sings the Letany.

O Almighty and everlasting God, Creator of all things, Ruler of Angels, King
of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who made thy Servant Abraham triumph over his
Enemies; did give many victories to Moses, and ^nah, the Governors of the
people; did raise and exalt Da^id thy Servant to be a King over them; di^
enrich Sol^mon his Son with the gift of Wisdom and Un^ and blessedst him with
peace and great prosperity. Give ear we beseech thee unto our humble Prayers,
and multiply thy blessings upon this thy Servant, who is now to be consecrated
our King, that He being strengthened with the faith of Abraham, endued with the
mildness of Moses, armed with the fortitude of Joshuah, exalted with the
humility of David, and beautified with the Wisdom of Solomon, may please thee
in all things, and ever walk uprightly in thy ways. Defend him by thy mighty
arm, compass him with thy protection, and give him to overcome all his and
thine Enemies. Honor him before all the Kings of the Earth. Let him rule over
Countries, and let Nations adore him. Establish his Throne with Judgment and
Equity, let Justice flourish in his days, and grant that He underpropped by
the due obedience and hearty love of his People, may sit on the Throne of his
Forefathers for many years, and after this life may reign with thee in thine
everlasting kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Amen.

The Letany thus ended, the Archbishop begins to say aloud, Lift up your
Hearts and give thanks unto the Lord.

Answer: By the Bishops that sings the Letany.

We lift them up unto the Lord, and to give thanks unto him it is meet and
right.

Then the Archbishop says,

It is very meet and right and our bounden duty so to do, and at all times, and
in all Places to give thanks to thee O Lord, holy Father, almighty and
everlasting God, the strength of thy Chosen, and the exalter of the humble, who
in the beginning by sending the ^oud of Waters did punish the sins of the
World; and by a Dove bringing an Olive branch in her mouth, did give a token
of Reconcilement to the Earth; Who afterward did consecrate thy Servant
Aaron a Priest, by the anointing of Oil, as also by the pouring out of the same
did make Kings, Priests, and Prophets to govern thy People Israel: And by the
voice of the Prophet David did foretell, that the Countenance of thy Church
should be made joyful with Oil: We boseech thee to bless and sanctify this thy
Servant King Charles, that he may minister Peace unto this People, that he may
attain to the perfection of Government in Counsel and Judgment, and that his
Countenance may be always cheerful and amiable to all his People, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

This Prayer said the King rises from his devotion, and reposeth himself awhile
in the Chair of State, in which he is to be Crowned.

Afterward he goes to the Altar, and stands with his Back close unto it,
disrobes himself of his upper Garment, his under Coat having the loops opened
in the Places where he is to be anointed.

Then he comes to the Pulpit side, and sitting in a Chair, a Canopy is held
over his Head all the time of his Anointing.

The Archbishop first anoints his Hands in the Palms saying; In the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (which words he repeats in all
the several Anointings) let these hands be anointed with Oil, as Kings and
Prophets have been anointed: And as Samuel did anoint David to be King, that
thou may be blessed and established a King in this Kingdom over the People,
whom the Lord thy God has given thee to rule and govern: Which he vouchsafe to
grant, who with the Father and the Holy Ghost is one, and reigns in glory
everlasting. Amen.

In this time the Singers do sing the Anthem, Sado^ke the Priest and Nathan the
Prophet anoin^ed Solomon King, and all the People rejoiced and said, God save
the King for ever.

Then the Archbishop says this Prayer.

Look down Almighty God upon this thy Servant, our dread Sovereign King
Charles, with thy favorable countenance and as thou did bless Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, so vouchsafe we beseech thee to water him plentifully with
the Blessing of thy Grace; give unto him of the dew of Heaven, and of the
fatness of the Earth, abundance of Corn, Wine, and Oil, with all plenty of
fruits, and other good things. Grant him long to continue, and that in his
time there may be health and peace in this Kingdom. Grant O Almighty God that
he may be a mighty Protector of this Country, a bountiful Comforter of
Churches, and holy Societies, the most valiant of Kings, terrible to Rebels and
Infidels, amiable to his Nobles, and to all his faithful Subjects. Make his
Royal Court to shine in Princely dignity as a most clear Lightning, far and
wide in the Eyes of all men. Finally let him be blessed with happy Children,
that Nota.
may reign as Kings, after him and rule this Kingdom by Succession of all Ages,
and after the glorious and happy days of present life, give him of thy mercy
an everlasting Kingdom with thee in the Heavens, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.

The Prayer ended, the Archbishop proceeds in the Anointing. 1. His Breast. 2.
Betwixt the Shoulders. 3. Both the Points of the Shoulders. 5. Boughs of his
Arms. 5. The Crown of his Majesty's head.

The Anointing done: the Dean of the Chapel closes the loops again, which
were opened.

Then the Archbishop reads this Benediction. God the Son of God, Christ Jesus
our Lord, who was anointed of his Father with Oil of gladness above his
fellows; pour down upon thy Head the Blessing of the Holy Ghost, and make it
enter into the inward parts of thy Heart, so that thou may reign with him in
the Heavens eternally. Amen.

This pronounced, a shallow Quoife is pnt upon the Kings head, because of the
Anointing.

Then the King goerh to the Altar, and the Robe is put By the Lord Chamb.
upon him, at which the Archbishop says this Prayer.

O God the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, by whom Kings do reign, and
Lawgivers make good Laws, vouchsafe in thy favor to bless this thy Servant
Charles, in all his Government, that living godly, and leading his People by
the way of righteousness, after a glorious course in this life he may attain
that joy which has no end, through our Lord. Amen.

Then the Sword is brought to the Archbishop, who By the Earl^: Bobun.
laying it on the Altar, prays in this manner.

Hea^ our prayers, we beseech thee O Lords and vouchsafe by thy right hand of
Majesty to bless and sanctify this Sword, wherewith thy Servant Charles
desires to be girt, by the same he may defend Churches, Widows, Orphans, and
all the People of God, against the savage cruelty of Pagans and Infid^ls; and
that it may be a terror, and fear to all those that lie in wait to do
mischief; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then the Archbishop takes up the Sword, and puts it in the Kings hand saying.

Receive this Kingly Sword for the defense of the faith of Christ, and
protection of his Holy Church; and remember him of whom the psalmist did
prophecy saying. ^ird thy self with thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O thou most
mighty; and with thy sword execute thou Equity and justice. Pursue all
Heretics and Infidels, defend Widows and Orphans, restore the things that are
gone to decay, maintain and confirm the things that are restored and in good
order, destroy the growth of iniquity, and take punishment of all injustice,
that you may be glorious in the triumph of virtue, and reign with him whose
Image you bear, for ever and ever. Amen.

The Sword is girt to the Kings side by one of the Peers By the Earl^ Bo^un.
thereto oppointed.

Then the King returns to the Chair, wherein he was anointed, and has the
Spurs put on by the Lord Marshal.

Aster which the Archbishop taking the Crown in his hand says this prayer.

O God the Crown of all the faithful, who do Crown their Heads with precious
Stone that trust in thee, bless and sanctify this Crown, that as the same is
adorned with many precious Stones, so this thy Servant that wears the same may
be replenished of thy Grace with the manifold gifts of all precious Virtues,
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then the Archbishop crowns the King saying. God Crown thee with a Crown of
glory and righteousness, with the Honor and virtue of fortitude, that by a
right faith, and manifold fruits of good works you may obtein the Crown of an
everlasting kingdom, by the gift of him whose kingdom endu^eth for ever. Amen.

Then the King goes to the Stage and sits in the Chair of State, which is
placed by the Throne.

Then the Lion by direction of the Marshal calls the Nobles, who set their
hands to the Crown, and say every man these words. So God not help me, as I
shall support thee. And when they have done, they all hold up their hands, and
swear to be loyal and true Subjects.

The Marshals having in his hand the obligatory Oath of the People, goes to
the four Corners of the Stage, and reads the same to the Lion, who cries it
down to the people, and they all hold up their hands and say. Amen.

The Oath of the People is this. We swear, and by the holding up of our hauds
do promise all subjection and loyalty to King Charles, our dread Sovereign, and
as we wish God to be merciful unto us, shall be to his Majesty true and
faithful, and be ever ready to bestow our Lives, Lands, and what else God has
given us, for the defense of his sacred Person and Crown.

When the King is Crowned the Earls and Viscounts put on their Crowns, and
the Lion his. The other Barons and Lords continue bare and uncovered.

Then is this Anthem sung.
Be strong and of good courage, and observe the Commandments of the Lord to
walk in his ways, and keep his Ceremonies, Precepts, Testimonies and
Judgments. And almighty God strengthen and prosper thee, wheresoever thou
go. The Lord is my ruler, theresore I shall want nothing. The King shall
rejoice in thy strength oh Lord, exceeding glad shall he be of thy Salvation.
For thou have granted him his hearts desire, and have not denied him the
request of his lips, for thou have prevented him with blessings of goodness,
and have set a Crown of pure Gold upon his Head.

After this the King goes down again, looses his Sword wherewith he was girt^
and offers it, laying the same upon the Altar, which one of the Chief Nobles
redeems with an Offering, and then draws it forth, and carries the same naked
before the King.

Then the Archbishop takes the Scepter, and delivers it in the Kings right hand
with these words.

Receive the Scepter the sign of royal power, the Rod of the kingdom, the Rod
of virtue, that thou may govern thy self aright, defend the holy Church, and
all the Christian people committed by God to thy charge, punishing the wicked,
and protecting the just.

And then he says this Prayer.
O Lord the fountain of all good things, and the Author of all good
proceedings, grant we beseech thee, to this thy Servant that he may rightly use
the Dignity which he has by Inheritance; vouchsafe to confirm the Honor which
thou have given him before all Kings, and enrich him with all Benedictions.
Establish his Throne, visit him with increase of Children, let Ju^ice spring up
in his days and his Soul be filled with joy and gladness, till he be
translated to thine everlasting kingdom. Amen.

After this the Archbishop blesses the King saying. The Lord bless thee and
keep thee, and as he has made thee King over his people, so he still may
prosper thee in this world, and in the World to come make Thee partaker of his
eternal felicity. Amen.

The King then kisseth the Archbishop and Bishops assistant. After that the
King ascends the Stage attended by the Nobles, and the Singers sing Te Deum
laudamus, T. D^um.
etc.

Which ended, the Archbishop enthrones the King saying. Stand and hold fast
from henceforth the place ^ta.
whereof you are the righteous and lawful Heir by a long and linea^ ^uccession
of your Forefathers, which is now delivered unto you, by the authority of
Almighty God, and by the hands of us the Bish^ps, and Servants of God; And as
you see the Clergy come more near to the Altar then others, so where it is
convenient you will remember to give them that honor and respect which is due
to their places, that the Mediator of God and man, may establish you in this
kingly ^hrone, and that with him you may reign and live for ever.

Then goes the Chancellor to the four Coruers of the Stage, and proclaims his
Majesty's pardon, with offer of the same under the Great Seal of Scotland, to
all who shall require it. Upon which the people make their Acclamations crying,
God save the King.

This done the Archbishop and Bishops kneel down, and make their Homage, their
hands being betwixt the Kings hands, and these words are read unto them.

J. A. B. shall be faithful and true, and faith and truth bear, unto you our
Sovereign Lord, and your Heirs Kings of Scotland, and I shall do, and truly
acknowledge the Service of the Lands, which I shall claim to hold of you in the
right of the Church, as God help me.

And they shall kiss the Kings left cheek. After them the Temporal Lords in
like manner kneeling and holding their hands betwixt the Kings hands, have
these words read unto them.

J. A. B. become your Liege man and truth and faith I shall bear unto you, live
and die against all manner of folks whomsover in your Service. So God me help.

They kiss likewise the Kings left cheek. The King gives the Scepter to such
as it shall please his Majesty for carrying the same, and goes down to the
Chair of Estate over against the Pulpit.

And the Archbishop going to the Altar or Table, begins the Communion.

The Communion ended and blessing given, the King with the Crown on his Head,
and Scepter in his hand returns with the whole Train in most solemn manner to
his Palace.

The Trumpets sound, the Canons shout, and other small Shot are discharged.
Silver and Gold pieces coined for that purpose are cast among the People.

And then the King goes to his Feast, which is ordered as his Majesty shall
give direction.

God Save the KING.
Having given You this large Account of the Ceremony, and Prayers used at the
Coronations of our own and other Christian Kings and Emperors; I shall

6^ 62.
Diodorus Siculus, touching the Form of Prayer and Solemnities used at the
inauguration of the ancient Pagan Kings of Egypt.

When the Egyptian King was to be inthroned, he had such a Copy of the Laws
delivered to him, by which he was to conform himself in all things, and an
exact Estate of the Realm presented to him by Letters written from all parts:
Tum lotus, and regni insignibus splendidaque trabea ornatus, diis sacrificatum

I shall conclude this whole Treatise with the usual thanks and Prayer of the
Prelates, Lords, and Commons assembled in Parliament in the name all of other
Subjects of England (whom they represent) entered upon every general Pardon of
the King passed in Parliament, wherein they pray God to give him a peaceable,
good and long life, in these words.

Les Prelates, Seigneurs, and Commones en ce^t Parleament assembles, au nom de
touts vous autres subjects, Remercient treshumblement vostre Majesty, and
Prient deiu vous doner en sante, bone vie, and long.

And with these Prayers and Collects for the King of England in the Book of
Common Prayer.

Priest. O LORD SAVE THE KING. Answer: (by all the people.) And mercifully hear
us when we call upon ^hee.

Almighty God, whose Kingdom is everlasting and power infinite, have mercy
upon the whole congregation, and so rule the heart of thy chosen Servant,
CHARLES OUR KING AND GOVERNOR, that he (knowing whose minister he is) may
above all things seek thy honor and glory, and that we his Subjects (duly
considering whose authority he has) may faithfully serve, honor and humbly
obey him, in thee, and for thee, according to thy blessed word and ordinance,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with Thee and the holy Ghost, lives and
reigns one God, world without end. Amen.

Almighty and everlasting God, we be taught by thy holy word, that the hearts
of Kings are in thy rule and governance, and that thou do dispose and turn
them as it seems best to thy godly wisdom; we beseech thee, so to dispose
and govern the heart of CHARLES, THY SERVANT OUR KING AND GOVERNOR, THAT IN ALL
HIS THOUGHTS WORDS AND WORKS, HE MAY EVER SEEK THY HONOR AND GLORY, AND STUDY
TO PRESERVE THY PEOPLE COMMITTED TO HIS CHARGE, IN WEALTH, PEACE, AND
GODLINESS: Grant this, O merciful Father for thy sons sak^ Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.

^ Sam ^ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The Lord kills and makes alive, he brings down to
the grave, and brings up again; The Lord makes poor and makes rich, he
brings low and lifts up: He raises up the poor out of the dust, and
lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among Princes and to make
them inherit the Throne of glory, etc. The Adversaries of the Lord shall be
broken in pieces, out of heaven shall he thunder upon them, the Lord shall
judge the ends of the earth, AND HE SHALL GIVE STRENGTH UNTO HIS KING, AND
EXALT THE HORN OF HIS ANOINTED.

GOD SAVE KING CHARLES THE SECOND.
AMEN.
