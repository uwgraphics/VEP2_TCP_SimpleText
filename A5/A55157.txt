A Panegyric Mercury UPON THE SUCCESSES AGAINST THE TURKS, In the AUTUMN, 1683.
BY the Goodness and Bounty of Pope Innocent the XI.
By the Councils and Industry of the most August Emperor, Leopold the I.
By the Good Fortune and Dispatch of John the III. King of Poland.
By the Truth and Bravery of Maximilian, Electoral-Duke of Bavaria.
By the Generosity and Courage of John George the III. Electoral-Duke of Saxony.
By the Vigilance of Charles, Duke of Lorrain, in the Field.
By the Constancy of Ernestus, Count Staremberg, within the Walls.
In fine, By the Joint Force
Of the Fighting Layety, and the Praying Priesthood.
By an admirable Agreement of All in the Best Cause.
With the Aids of CHRIST.
Without the Reinforcements of the most Christian Prince.
Against the Antichristian.
VIENNA stands Delivered;
The Turkish Power staggers;
The Fortune of Rebellion falls;
The Gate of Gran is Opened;
Austria shines after its Fires, and tryumphs after Fields of Blood;
For whom GOD always employs Wonders
Against the Councils of the Ottoman and French.
Dread therefore, ye Enemies, GOD Fighting for Leopold!
Love, ye Subjects, Leopold, Fighting for GOD!
Utter Ruin be your Hope, ye Rebels!
Entire Victory yours, our Loyal Friends!
For,
Let Heaven, and Earth, and Hell be moved,
In the End,
The Good CAUSE is Crowned.

Tandem
Bona CAUSA triumphat.
