THE PREFACE.
FOr the perfect acquiring of any Language whatsoever there are two things
mainly required, First to be acquainted in some Measure with the Words of the
said Language, Next to understand how to put them together in such sort, as
thereby to produce Harmonious Sense and Concord: The right way of putting Words
together Effectually, is by the Variation of them; Nouns into their several
Cases, Verbs into their several Moods and Tenses; For as in Building*two pieces
of Timber cannot be well fastened together till the Artists Tool has fitted and
shaped them to that purpose, by Dovetail, Tenon and Mortice, or the like, so no
true Syntax can be brought about, till by the said Variation Words are disposed
together, in such a form as may render them Capable of such a Conjunction:
Whereas, were they Clapped together unformed, and Undeclin'd, what could be
expected but a Babel of Confusion and Discord? The Ancients, at least the
Greeks and Latins were wonderfully Elaborate and Careful in the diversifying,
or Variously terminating the Cases of their Nouns: From whith curious diversity
of Terminations, there results an Elegance of Construction, above what even the
best of the Modern Europaen Tongues, (which I take to be the Italian) is capable
of Expressing. And besides this Curiosity of Declination amongst the Greeks and
Romans, the manner of their Derivation and Composition is also very Observable,
and worthy to have been more Largely Treated of, among other parts of
Grammatical Subject, than I have yet found it to be, in any System of Grammar:
Whereupon having already Published a Materia Verborum, I have Adjoined this
small Treatise by way of Essay, which as occasion serves, may be Improved and
Enlarged. The knowledge then of Words whether Primitive, Derivative, or
Compositive, is to be doubly considered, First as to their Signification, Next
their Formation; and the first of these Knowledges, in my Opinion, is properly
and Naturally the first part of a Learners Office, contrary to the Common
Method, since the Knowledge of the Name of any thing is ever antecedent to the
knowledge of its Nature. He that has Treasured up in his Memory a competent
stock of Words, will be the more easily induced to take pains to inform himself
of what ever may conduce to the Application of them, as any one will sooner
engage himself in the Concernments of a familiar and known Person, than of a
Stranger. Dictionaries we have many, very Elaborate and Copious; more Copious
indeed than what is absolutely required for a Learner; it being most apparently
evident that one third part of the Words, even of the most Unaugmented
Dictionaries, will abundantly suffice for the Reading of any Classical and
Authentic Author; besides that, not any one can be capable of making use of a
Dictionary, that is not Tollerably versed in the Formation of Words. So that a
well ordered Materia Verborum to be got without Book, whether according to the
usual Method of the Nomenclatura's, or otherwise, ought in my Opinion to be the
first Praeparatory Work to be began with, as a Foundation for the Building up
of a Latinist, or any other Master of Language: But for the gaining of a good
stock of Latin Words, there cannot certainly be any better Course taken, than a
full and perfect Acquisition of all the Radical and Underiv'd, at least such as
are purely and Naturally Latin: For tho perhaps they amount not one with
another, to the tenth part of those Genuine Words produced by Derivation and
Composition which often Occurring in Authors, are therefore Materi^ and
Necessary to be known. Yet certain it is, that whoeve^ possesses the
Fountains, has the greater Command and Benef^^ of the Streams that flow from
thence. So that he that i^ Master of the Primitives, has at one View the Lati^
Tongue, and will be thereby the more easily induced, an^ the better Capacitated
to Consider and Inquire into the manner of how any Word he chances to meet with
is Derived from or Compounded with a Word he already Knows, as he w^^ at a
Distance has the prospect of any Noble Castle; Town or Palace, will have the
greater Mind by a Personal Visi^ to take a more particular View thereof. To
speak farther o^ the Usefulness of this Design, will be a thing altogether
nee^less: One Evidence by plain Proof, goes farther than an hundred Arguments.
I will therefore leave the Event of wh^^ I have Asserted to the Trial the World
may, if it please, ma^^ thereof.

OF THE COMPOSITES Of the LATIN TONGUE.
THere was doubtless never any Language or Speech in any part of the World, to
which there did not more or less, something of Composition belong, that is a
sort of Coalition or Consociation of two or more Words together: But of all
Languages that ever were Writ or Spoke, I verily believe the Greek first, and
after that the Latin, have far the most* Elegant and Graceful way of
Composition. Of the latter my purpose is to say something at present, with as
much Brevity as may be.

Verbs, Nouns, Adverbs, Praepositions, are all Compoundable one among another,
but the most common and frequent sort of Composition, is of Verbs with
Praepositions.

to be in Doubt about any Business. Digero, to Digest, to carry into diverse
Parts. Recedo, to go Back. Redamo, to Love again.
