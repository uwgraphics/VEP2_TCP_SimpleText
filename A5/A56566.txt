THE PASTORAL LETTER REBURNT BY A POETICAL FLAMBEAU.
^HY Pen so paints thy self, that justly we
View Burnet burning in Effigy;
^^ose Pastoral Letter into Fire was doomed,
(...) Spiritual Witchcraft, as by most presumed:
(...) doubtless it is, in sense of Hell, some merit,
(...)be of Pluto's Hierarchy in Spirit.
(...) o have made Evil so refin'dly vile,
(...) in thy Mother Tongue and English Style,
(...)ou for greedy Scotland did devise
(...)there Presbytery should leanly rise,
(...) the Mitres had been melted down,
^^rease the income of thy William's Crown:
(...) for thy profit could that Text forego,
(...) thou do Sarum's Mag-pye Prelate show.
(...) Sleeves of Lawn, the Badge of such a Wretch,
(...) yield, in time, a Relick for Jack-ketch.
(...) 'twill be hard for thee, as many think,
(...)' escape in Body, since thy Soul in lnk
(...)s been his Handsel, and most Men agree
(...)at thy black inside in thy Lines they see.
(...)ough impious Roman power had so prevailed,
(...)t Tully's hand was to the Rostrum nailed;
which held the admired Pen that gave to Fame
^^e Flower of Eloquence living in his Name.
Thou, by a different fate, would Eyes delight,
If fixed thy Wicked Hand, which did indite
Sermons and Pamphets, to thy Sarum Chair,
That future Bishops might abhor thee there.
Had now Pythagoras lived, he would have said,
Hugh Peter's Soul had Transmigration made
Into thy Bulk, and not more damned could be,
Than as, In Spirit, he survives in thee.
From a Fanatic Scot, transformed of late
To an immoral Pagan of our State;
Thou do as Antichristianly possess
Thy See, as Tillotson does his, some guess.
But thanks to Heaven, the House's prudent Vote
Does thee a Canting Prelate so denote,
That in thy condemmed Pastoral Letter's fate,
Thee and thy mischiefs all must Abdicate.
Whilst like some Witch, when lost her former spell,
Thou griev'st for want of Magic to do ill:
And though in Soul of everlasting Evil,
Thou Wilt now, do what thou can, live less a Devil.
FINIS.
