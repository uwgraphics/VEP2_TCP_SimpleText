A TRUE TALE OF Robin Hood.
BOth Gentlemen and Yeomen bold
or whatsoever you are,
To have a stately story told
attention now prepare:
It is a Tale of Robin Hood,
that I to you will tell,
Which being rightly understood,
I know will please you well.
This Robin (so much talked on)
was once a man of Fame,
Instiled Earl of Huntington,
Lord Robert Hood by Name.
In Courtship and Magnificence
his Carriage won him praise,
And greater favor with his Prince
than any in our days.
In bounteous Liberality
he too much did excel,
And loved men of Quality
more than exceeding-well:
His great Revenues all he sold
for Wine and costly cheer,
He kept three hundred Bow-men bold,
he shooting loved so dear:
No Archer living in his time
with him might well compare:
He practiced all his youthful prime
that Exercise most rare.
At last by his profuse expense
he had consumed his wealth;
And being outlawed by his Prince,
in Woods he lived by stealth.
The Abbot of St. Mary's rich,
to whom he money ought,
His hatred to the Earl was such,
that he his downfall wrought.
So being outlawed (as it is told)
he with a Crew went forth
Of lusty Cutters stout and bold,
and robbed in the North.
Among the rest one Little John
a Yeoman bold and free,
Who could (if it stood him upon)
with ease encounter three:
One hundred men in all he got,
with whom (the story says)
Three hundred common men durst not
hold combat any ways.
They Yorkshire Woods frequented much
and Lancashire also,
Wherein their practices were such
that they wrought muckle woe.
None Rich durst travel to and fro,
though never so strongly armed,
But by these Thieves (so strong in show)
they still were robbed and harmed.
His chiefest spite to the Clergy was
that lived in monstrous pride:
No one of them he would let pass
along the Highway side,
But first they must to dinner go,
and afterward to shrift;
Full many a one he served so,
thus while he lived by Theft.
No Monks nor Friars he would let go,
without paying their Fees:
If they thought much to be used so,
their Stones he made them lose;
For such as they the Country filled
with Bastards in those days:
Which to prevent, these Sparks did geld
all that came in their ways.
But Robin Hood so gentle was,
and bore so brave a mind,
If any in distress did pass,
to them he was so kind,
That he would give and lend to them
to help them in their need;
This made all poor men pray for him
and wish he well might speed.
The Widow and the Fatherless
he would send means unto:
And those whom famine did oppress
found him a friendly foe.
Nor would he do a woman wrong,
but see her safe conveyed
He would protect with power strong
all those who craved his aid:
The Abbot of St. Mary's then
who him undid before,
Was riding with two hundred men,
and Gold and Silver store:
But Robin Hood upon him set,
with his courageous Sparks,
And all the Coin perforce did get,
which was twelve thousand Marks:
He bound the Abbot to a Tree,
and would not let him pass,
Before that to his men and he
his Lordship had said Mass:
Which being done, upon his Horse
he set him fast astride,
And with his face toward his Arse
he forced him to ride,
His men were forced to be his guide,
for he rode backward home:
The Abbot being thus villify'd,
did sorely chafe and fume.
Thus Robin Hood did vindicate
his former wrongs received:
For 'twas this covetous Prelate
that him of Land bereaved.
The Abbot he rode to the King
with all the haste he could:
And to his Grace he every thing
exactly did unfold:
And said that if no course were ta'n
by force or stratagem,
To take this Rebel and his Train,
no man should pass for them.
The King protested by and by
unto the Abbot then
That Robin Hood with speed should dye,
with all his merry men.
But e're the King did any send,
he did another feat:
Which did his Grace much more offend,
the fact indeed was great:
For in a short time after that
the Kings Receivers went
Toward London with the coin they got,
for s Highness Northern Rent;
Bold Robin Hood and Little John,
with the rest of their Train,
(Not dreading Law) set them upon,
and did their Gold obtain.
The King much moved at the same,
and the Abbots talk also,
In thi^ his anger did proclaim,
and sent word to and fro,
That whosoever alive or dead
could bring him Robin Hood,
Should have one thousand marks well paid
in Gold and Silver good.
This promise of the King did make
full many Yeomen bold
Attempt stout Robin Hood to take
with all the force they could;
But still when any came to him
within the gay green wood,
He entertainment gave to them
with Venison fat and good,
And showed to them such Martial sport
with his long Bow and Arrow,
That they of him did give report,
how that it was great sorrow
That such a worthy man as he
should thus be put to shift,
Being a late Lord of high degree,
of living quite bereft.
The King to take him more and more
sent men of mickle might:
But he and his still beat them sore,
and conquered them in fight:
Or else with love and courtesy,
to him he won their hearts.
Thus still he lived by Robbery
throughout the Northern parts.
And all the Country stood in dread
of Robin Hood and's men:
For stouter Lads never lived by bread
in those days nor since then:
The Abbot (which before I named)
sought all the means he could,
To have by force this Rebel ta'n
and his Adherents bold:
Therefore he arm^d five hundred men
with furniture complete:
But the Outlaws slew half of them,
and made the rest retreat,
The long Bow and the Arrow keen,
they were so used unto:
That still he kept the Forest green
in spite of the proudest foe,
Twelve of the Abbots men he took
who came to have him ta'n,
When all the rest the field forsook,
these he did entertain,
With banqueting and merriment,
and having used them well,
He to their Lord them safely sent
and willed them him to tell,
That if he would be pleased at last
to beg of our good King,
That he might pardon what was past,
and him to favor bring,
He would surrender back again
the money which before
Was taken by him and ^s men
from him and many more.
Poor men might safely pass by him,
and some that way would choose,
For well they knew that to help them
he evermore did use.
But where he knew a Miser rich
that did the poor oppress,
To feel his Coin his hands did itch,
he would have it more or less:
And sometimes when the Highway failed,
then he his courage rouzes;
He and his men have often assailed
such rich men in their houses:
So that through dread of Robin then
and his adventurous Crew,
The Misers kept great store of men,
which else maintained but few.
King Richard, of that name the first,
surnamed Coeur de Lion,
Went to defeat the Pagans Cursed,
who kept the Coasts of Sion,
The Bishop of Ely Chancellor,
was left a Viceroy here,
Who like a Potent Emperor
did proudly domineer.
Our Chronicles of him report
that commonly he rode
With a thousand horse from court to court
where he would make abode.
He riding down toward the North
with his aforesaid Train,
Robin and his did issue forth,
them all to entertain.
And with the gallant gray-Goose-wing
they showed to them such play
That made their Horses kick and fling
and down their Riders lay.
Full glad and fain the Bishop was,
for all his thousand men,
To seek what means he could to pass
from out of Robin's ken:
Two hundred of his men were killed,
and fourscore Horses good,
Thirty who did as Captives yield
were carried to the green wood:
Which afterward were ransomed
for twenty marks a man:
The rest set Spurs to Horse and fled
to the Town of Warrington.
The Bishop sore enraged then
did in King Richards name
Muster up a power of Northern men,
these Outlaws bold to tame,
But Robin with his courtesis
so won the meaner sort,
That they were loath on him to try
what rigor did import,
So that bold Robin and his Train
did live unhurt of them,
Until King Richard came again
from fair Jerusalem:
And then the talk of Robin Hood
his Royal Ears did fill,
His Grace admired that in the green wood
he was continued still:
So that the Country far and near
did give him great applause;
For none of them need stand in fear,
but such as broke the Laws.
He wished well unto the King,
and prayed still for his health,
And never practiced any thing
against the Commonwealth;
Only because he was undone
by the cruel Clergy then,
All means that he could think upon
to vex such kind of men,
He enterpriz'd with hateful spleen,
for which he was to blame,
For fault of some to wreak his teen
on all that by him came.
With wealth that he by Roguery got,
eight Almshouses he built,
Thinking thereby to purge the blot
of blood which he had spilt:
Such was their blind Devotion then,
depending on their works,
Which if 'twere true, we Christian men
inferior were to Turks:
But to speak true of Robin Hood,
and wrong him not a jot,
He never would shed any man's blood
that him invaded not.
Nor would he injure Husbandmen
that toil at Cart and Plough:
For well he knew were not for them,
to live no man knew how.
The King in person with some Lords
to Nottingham did ride,
To try what strength and skill affords
to crush this Outlaws pride.
And as he once before had done,
he did again proclaim,
That whosoever would take upon
to bring to Nottingham
Or any place within the Laud
Rebellious Robin Hood,
Should be preferred in place to stand
with those of Noble Blood.
When Robin Hood heard of the same,
within a little space,
Into the Town of Nottingham
a Letter to his Grace
He shot upon an Arrow head
one evening cunningly:
Which was brought to the King and read
before his Majesty:
The Tenor of this Letter was
That Robin should submit
And be true Liegeman to his Grace
in any thing that is fit,
So that his Highness would forgive
him and his merry men all:
If not, he must in the green wood live
and take what chance did fall.
The King would feign have pardoned him
but that some Lords did say,
This President will much condemn
your Grace another day.
While that the King and Lords did stay
debating on this thing,
Some of these Outlaws fled away
unto the Scottish King.
For they supposed if he were ta'n,
or to the King did yield,
By the Commons all the rest of's train
full quickly would be quelled.
Of more than full an hundred men,
but forty tarried still,
Who were resolved to stick to him
let fortune work her will.
If none had fled, all for his sake
had got their pardon free:
The King to favor meant to take
his merry men and he.
But e're the pardon to him came
this famous Archer died:
His death and manner of the same
i will presently describe.
For being vexed to think upon
his followers revolt,
In melancholy passion
he did recount his fault:
Perfidious Traitors said he then,
in all your dangers past
Have I you guarded as my men
to leave me thus at last;
This sad perplexity did cause
a Fever (as some say)
Which him unto confusion draws
though by a stranger way.
This deadly danger to prevent,
he hie'd him with all speed
Unto a Nunnery with intent
for his healths-sake to bleed.
A faithless Friar did pretend
in love to let him blood:
But he by falsehood wrought the end
of famous Robin Hood.
The Friar (as some say) did this
to vindicate the wrong
Which to the Clergy he and his
had done by power strong.
Thus dyed he by treachery,
that could not dye by force:
Had he lived longer certainly
King Richard in remorse
Had unto favor him receiv^d,
he brave men elevated:
It Is pity he was of life bereaved
by one which he so hated;
A treacherous Leach this Friar was,
to let him bleed to death:
And Robin was methings an Ass
to trust him with his breath.
His Corpse the Prioress of the place
the next day that he dy^d,
Caused to be buried (in mean case)
close by the Highway side.
And over him she caused a stone
to be fixed on the ground,
An Epitaph was set thereon,
wherein his name was found,
The date of the year and day also,
she made to be set there:
That all who by the way did go,
might see st plain appear.
That such a man as Robin Hood
was buried in that place:
And how he lived in the green wood
and robbed there for a space.
It seems that though the Clergy he
had put to mickle woe,
He should not quite forgetten be,
although he was their foe;
This woman though she did him hate,
yet loved his memory:
And thought it wondrous pity that
his fame should with him dye,
This Epitaph, as Records tell,
within this hundred years
By many was discerned well,
but time all things out-wears.
His followers when he was dead,
were some reprieved to grace;
The rest to foreign Countries fled,
and left their native place.
Although his Funeral was but mean,
this woman had in mind,
Least his fame should be buried clean
from those that came behind.
For certainly before nor since
no man e're understood
Under the Reign of any Prince,
of one like Robin Hood.
Full thirteen years and something more
these Outlaws lived thus;
Feared of the Rich, loved of the Poor,
a thing most mavelous.
A thing impossible to us
this story seems to be:
None dares be now so venturous,
but times are changed we see.
We that live in these later days
of civil government,
If need be, have an hundred ways
such Outlaws to prevent.
In those days men more barbarous were,
and lived less in awe:
Now (God be thanked) people fear
more to offend the Law.
No roaring Guns were then in use,
they dreamt of no such thing:
Our English men in fight did use
the gallant gray-Goose wing;
In which activity these men
(through practice) were so good,
That in those days none equaled them,
(especially Robin Hood,)
So that it seems keeping in Caves,
in Woods and Forests thick,
They Would beat a multitude with staves,
their Arrows did so prick:
And none durst near unto them come,
unless in courtesy;
All such he bravely would send home
with mirth and jollity;
Which courtesy won him such love,
as I before have told,
'Twas the chief cause that he did prove
more prosperous than he could.
Let us be thankful for these times
of plenty, truth and peace:
And leave our great and horrid crimes,
least they cause this to cease.
I know there^s many feigned Tales
of Robin Hood and's Crew,
But Chronicles which seldom fails
reports this to be true:
Let none then think this is a Lie,
for if 'twere put to the worst,
They may the truth of all descry
in the Reign of Richard the first,
If any Reader please to try
as I direction show,
The truth of this brave History,
he will find it true I know.
And I shall think my labor well
bestowed, to purpose good,
When It shall be said that I did tell
true Tales of Robin Hood.
The Epitaph which the Priores^ of the Monastry of Kirkslay in York shire set
over Robin Hood, which (as is before mentioned) was to be read within these
hundred years, though in old broken English, much to the same sense and meaning.

Decembris Quarto Die, 1198. Anno Regni Richardi primi 9.

Robert Earl of Huntington
Lies under this little stone,
No Archer was like him so good;
His wildness named him Robin Hood;
Full thirteen years and something more
These Northern parts he vexed sore;
Such Outlaws as he and his men
May England never know again.
Some other superstitious words were in, which I thought fit to leave out.

Finis.
