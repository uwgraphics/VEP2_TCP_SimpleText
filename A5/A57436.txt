CERTAIN PROPOSALLS In order to the Peoples Freedom and Accommodation in some
Particulars.

With the Advancement of Trade and Navigation of this Commonwealth in general.

Humbly tendered to the view of this prosperous Parliament, in this Juncture of
time, wherein They may both with more safety and far better deliberation
judge thereof, and if they see requisite, put them in a way of speedy execution,
to the great enriching, securing, cementing, and contenting the Universality of
this Nation, which has been much desired, and shall be still endeavou^^d by
Henry Robinson.

LONDON; Printed by M. Simmons, in Aldersgate-streete next door to the Golden
Lion. 1652.

To the Supreme Authority of this NATION, The High Court of Parliament.
RIGHT HONORABLE;
I Cannot say I now present You with much more than what I have formerly either
in Print or Manuscript pressed upon several Members of Parliament, which
perhaps were taken, as I observe They receive every morning of course as They
pass into the House, other men's Papers, Petitions, Books, which, through the
present business They are then to fall upon, many of Them may be necessitated
to put into their Pockets, without so much as examining the Title, much less
perusing them afterward.

However I am induced to take this farther pains, in briefly recapitulating
only the heads thereof, and varying their dress, with somewhat more
exaggerating their necessity for this Nations welfare, and Your own honor and
concernment, to see them put in speedy execution; Expecting to find You now
not only better at leisure to give ear thereto, but even seeking out all
manner of oportunities for Employing the Remaynder of this Parliament, about
such Affairs as may yet surpass, and serve as a Crown to all Your former
glorious Acheivements of war, to wit, the putting and establishing Us in the
ways of Peace, which cannot be done without confounding the distiction of
Courts of Common Law and Equity, and reducing them into one kind, at least,
mixed both of Common Law and Equity; The Reformation of many irrational and
destructive Laws, supplying new ones in their stead; But especially by
blasting the present expensive delatory and corrupt manner of proceedings in
all Courts, particularly that of Chauncery, both endless and boundless; all
which do eminently favor the Rich against the Poor; such as are strong in
freindship against the Fatherles and widows; even the Just against the
Innocent, and Right against Wrong, so certainly, as that whenever the Poor,
Fatherles and Widow, Freindles and Innocent happen to be sued for any thing
this world affords them, could they but so much deny themselves, and these
worldly superfluities, it were far better for them, according to that Gospel
advice, Matthew. 5. 40. to renounce them, than wage a suit at Law, though at last
they were sure to get the victory, in regard if it be rightly estimated, it
cannot countervaile the loss of time, expense of money, and the vexatiousness
of so many years soliciting and attendance: But I shall take occasion to
insist hereon more largely another time; and at present chiefly present You
with several particulars, in order to the establishing the People in their
freedoms, and setting the wheels of Trade a running; Some whereof are of
imminent necessity, and without which, these three Nations cannot so speedily
attain to such a competent estate of Riches and accommodation, as either to
live secured from Foreign Powers, or contentedly amongst themselves.

It is not the bare name of Liberty, and of a Commonwealth, or Free State,
can long satisfy the People, much less content, or really make them happy:
Some form of Government is necessary, but all Forms are good, though one more
perfect and better than another; And doubtless, it may be safely affirmed, that
even the worst kind of Government is capable of being so managed, or ordered,
as that a People might enjoy better days under it, than ever any yet did under
the very best of Governments from the beginning of the world; So lgnorant have
most former Governors and Powers been; I rather choose to Impute their errors
to their Ignorance, because I conceive it may be found upon debate, that no
sort of People have been more Ignorant of their own Charge and Duty, and more
to seek in their respective Stations and Callings, than Governors, or the
Powers of what kind soever, especially Monarchical or Imperial Powers; and
yet what Rank of Mankind have so great advantage, or can descharge their
trust, I mean so far forth as the People would rest satisfied therewith, with
so much ease as they, If they were not more Ignorant of their own Condition,
their Mystery and Trade, than other men? Poor People, Subjects as they are
called and made throughout the world, are even become contented to bear with
small oppressions, and cannot easily be provoked to attempt the wresting the
sword out of a Tyrants hand; they are easily prevailed to submit unto the
strongest sword, so they may but enjoy the Liberty of their Consciences, the
Freedom of their persons, and what they moyl and toil for: Now, how easily may
the Powers in being, of any Country at Peace, see this accomplished? And this
being done, improve, increase, and multiply their own Revenue, even to what
extent they themselves please, without aggrieving of the Subject, if They that
take upon them to be Masters of the World, did but understand the World aright:
If a single man that has 10000. l. in his purse, must either be a weak man, or
find out ways to maintain himself in an honorable Posture, and increase his
stock besides; with how much more advantage may a Prince, or the Powers in what
Land soever that have a yearly Revennue of 100000. l. or of a million, do the
same? The late King had raised his yearly Revenue almost unto a million; and it
is said his Ambition as then aspired no higher than the completing it to a
million: Now this Revenue of his, though it had yet been less, had his expenses
been managed with frugality, and the advance at years end been improved with
dexterity, I will be bold to say, it might have put him into such a capacity,
as that at one twenty or thirty years end, he might not only have bid
defiance to all this Nations enemies, even the King of Spain himself, but have
reduced him to his own conditions, though that Kings yearly Revenue was then
near ten times as much, as being the first Master of all the gold and silver
which from year to year keeps all Christendom together by the ears.

It is not so much the transcendent wisdom and abilities of any Prince or
Powers that gives them so great advantage over others, as such other respective
Prince or Powers gross Ignorance or Weakness which exposes them thereunto;
and I believe it will be granted me, that Princes and Commonwealths, in the
game they play amongst themselves, do commit more over-sights, and those
grosser too, then private persons, for this cause only, in that private
persons, as their business is far less, so they can better fathom and look
after it; Whereas Princes, for the most part, think no care so well becoming
them, as that of their Recreations and Passtimes: And the Ministers of
Commonwealths many times, are so intent after their own private affairs, and
that under color, and in a pretended pursuance of the Public; or else if it
cannot be made gainsome to them, shift it off from one to another until in the
upshot (according to our own Proverb, Every man's business, no man's husines) it
happen to be neglected by them al: To prevent which great mischief from
endangering this hapily begun Commonwealth, I should crave leave to propound,
that as there were in all times and Countries, allowed necessary Revenues, unto
Kings and Princes that took the burden of Government upon them, for the
maintaining of their charge; So, if the same course be not taken with all
Officers and Ministers of a Commonwealth, that they may have a full
maintenance allowed them, they must either be found to neglect their own
Families, whilst they study and follow after the Public Affairs, which they
will neither long have Joy in, nor be accounted wise men for so doing; or seek
themselves, not only to the scandal, but perhaps even to the endangering of
the Commonwealth.

I would not be mistaken, as though my Judgment were, that Members of future
Parliaments or Representatives, which I hope will be able to dispatch all the
business that is proper to them in some few months, should be thus provided
for by Sallaries; but absolutely on the contrary, whereby they may not have the
temptation of coveting the Employment.

I may not here omit to make mention of Your great Wisdom and Integrity, in
passing those selfe-denying Votes, of resolving to put the Powers formerly
committed to sundry Parliament Committees, about matters for the most part
totally below You, and exentrick, into the hands of such as are no Members of
Parliament, which otherwise would not only have grown to be an occasion of
great offense unto the People, but have absolutely disappointed the maine end
of Parliaments, through want of leisure to do such things, and transact such
businesses only as cannot be done by any less or Inferior Authority, then of
Your selves Assembled in Parliament.

Be pleased therefore for the better direction of future Representatives, in
convenient time to consider and declare Your Judgments what work is peculiar
for Parliaments, and what not, and accordingly become a President, though You
cannot become a Law unto Them.

Be pleased to consider, whether all Petitioners, or even a Boy or Messenger in
their behalf, ought not to be admitted, and that as they come to Your door in
course, and in like course be dispatched speedily with a short answer endorsed
upon their Petition, that they may know which way to steare, and what to trust
to: Also whether the like freedom for all persons to Petition the Council of
State, be not necessary at alltimes; as also for audience to be given, so many
days in a Week, to any person whatsoever, coming at such hours as shall be
agreed upon and published: So much the rather, that by this means many
Addresses unto future Parliaments will be prevented, which is to be endeavored
by all means possible. The great state and distance which has continually been
kept between the Rulers and the People, in times of Tyranny and Ignorance,
wherein poor Suppliants could not be admitted or heard, how equitable soever
their Supplications were, without the Intercession of some State-favourite or
other, doubtless over-swayed the poor hood-winked Papists to make so many
Mediators in Heaven: O let not this Hopeful Commonwealth, run the hazard of
being blasted for not better guarding us from this Idolatry, or suffer us to
languish any longer in the like sad condition, wherein it has been almost
impossible for any one to get a Petition to be read either in Parliament or
Counsel of State, unless he had a Saint there to befriend him, who if he were
not both very eminent and zealous, would likely either refuse to promote it, or
not prevail to get it granted, though perhaps it ought to have been done of
course. But for Parliaments, and in the Intervalls, for such in whom the chief
Power resides, to shut up their doors and ears from receiving Petitions, and
granting audience to all Comers, is a symptom of the most desperate Lethargy
in the Powers, and consequently of sudden Innovation and misery to the Nation.

Nay I will go one degree higher, and assert, that it is far less mischeivous
to indulg a Liberty of Libelling, then to deny the freedom of Petitioning and
speaking truth; though indeed that which some Persons and those in Powers too,
sometimes term libelling, may prove too sad and real truths; This Nation has
encountered much there of whithin these twelve years; And yet it ought to be as
ingeniously acknowledged, that even our Createst Deliverers have been as highly
slandered; But what are they the worse for it? Has it not added to their
renown? And they become so much more glorious Conquerours of their own
Passions, whilst they continued doing good for such as required them with
evil? Whereas if the Liberty both of Speech and Printing had been restrained,
under pretext of preventing libelling, we had to this day been continued in
that deep ignorance and superstition, which together with our Predecessors we
were borne in, never have been freed from Tyranny, nor exempted from Taxes of
all sorts, as shortly we may expect to be: The Citizens of Rome, even in these
latter Centuries did so highly value this Liberty of speaking their minds, as
that they would not be bassled out of it by their Popes Spiritualls nor
Temporalls; Witness that weatherbeaten mainsed statue of Pasquin, which they
Fished up again from the bottom of the River Tyber, and placed it where now
it still is to be seen, a most constant Avoucher and Abettor of whatsoever they
are forced to Publish in the Streets, because it will not be admitted in the
Court.

Be pleased then to Proclaim an absolute Liberty of Conscience, with a
Toleration of all differing opinions, provided they reproach not one another,
much less those forms which shall be chiefly countenanced by Authority: Let
not the Assembly prevail with their Bug-beare words of Heresy or Blasphemy,
thereby transporting You to act beyond Your own Reason or Understanding,
until they can tell You the difference between blaspheming God, and the King,
and what is meant by blaspheming of the King, 1 Kings 21. 10. Or Infallibly
demonstrate this or that which they assert for Heresy to be so.

Be pleased to take away the scandal and temptation from the Gospel Ministry,
not only of being Tyth-coveters, but of persecuting and Impleading People for
their Tyths sake, which even the Jews to whom only they were due, and they
only of the Tribe of Levi, and that Canaan only, were never warranted by the
Law of Moses; nor did any of them ever practice otherwise then receiving them
from such as paid them voluntarily, except the Sons of Eli, who for that
cause were called the Sons of Belial, as You may see 1 Samuel chapter 2. from verse.
8. to the 17. Ease many of the best of People of this Nation by dismounting
that Ordinance for Treble damages for refusing payment, which they do most
conscientiously and sincerely: The work would neither be difficult nor
chargeable: Please only to Enact all Tithes, etc. payable at present to the
Ministry, to be paid unto Officers of the Commonwealth, and that the
Commonwealth allow a competent maintenance to all approved Preaching
Ministers, whether in Parochial or private Assemblies, as has been for many
years, and is still practiced by the Provincial, States of Holland, even
toward the English both of the Presbyterian, and Congregationall or
Independent way at Amsterdam: But this is not all, the Inequality of Tything
both of the Minister and Impropriator is destructive to Husbandry, and
occasions that Bread-Corne is continually so scarce and dear amongst us: to
prevent which, It may likely be found expedient, that such lands as are plowed
be rated by the acre, and rather pay less then other land, in regard of the
great charge and consequently hazard the Husbandman is at in plowing of them
up, whereby he may be encouraged to plow greater quantity then formerly.

Be pleased to declare our freedom from being compelled to any manner of
Oaths of Covenanting Engagements, which, as Light and Liberty burst out
amongst us, do daily more and more discover, not only the unnecessarinesse
thereof, but even the Evil and Entanglements, into which they brought us
unavoydably through the Peoples differing Judgments and apprehensions, each
one interpreting them (and that rightly too) in their own sense, whereby they
think themselves obliged to persecute and oppose one another, who before lived
lovingly in Peace, and might have still continued so, had they not been jointly
engaged by Oath, which it was impossible for them all explicitly to understand
alike, and consequently must find themselves bound to fall out and quarrel,
even for Conscience and their Oaths sake.

In the next place be pleased to cast your thoughts on what is to be enacted
for the Recovery and Advancement of Trade; The Council of Trade are said to
have prepared several Bills in order thereunto; and it is high time that not
only all manner of obstructions be removed, but also that all manner of
Advantages be searched out and made use of before it be too late.

The first great pre-eminence which (amongst Foreign Nations) the Hollanders
and some others of the United Provinces have of us, is, In that their
Inhabitants live together in Towns and Cities of indifferent magnitudes,
neither too little, nor too big, whereby they are enabled to accommodate and
help themselves to the best advantage, without making Provisions, as to Food or
Trading over dear.

The second is, in that so many of their said Towns and Cities, either lie
Situated by the Seaside, or have Navigable Rivers or Ditches from one unto
another, and so into the Sea, by which means they have not only all manner of
Victuals brought so much cheaper unto them, but also all manner of Raw or
unwrought Commodities, whereby their People are set a work, and by this means
can afford all sorts of Manufactures, and Artificers work, so much cheaper as
is the difference between Land and Water carriage.

Thirdly, they have most of their first materials for building and rigging
Ships cheaper; man them with fewer persons, and Victual them with courser
fare, and at cheaper rates, by which means they can carry all manner of bulkie
Commodities (the sraight whereof rises high) so much cheaper, as must
necessarily beat us out of all Markets, where they have a desire to do it.

Fourthly, they always have great store of moneys, even whatsoever sums can
be desired upon good security at Interest for four or five in the hundred.

Fifthly, They have in a manner the whole Fishing Employment, as it were
engrossed unto themselves, I mean those of the United Provinces, but chiefly
the Hollanders and Zealanders, which with Butter, Cheese, Roots, (for little
Flesh serves their turns) does not only fully victual themselves, byt are by
them exported into other Countries in such great abundance, as that the whole
Trade of those Provinces is but the Return of their Fisherie, so manifoldly
complicated, as that it far exceeds, and is of far greater concernment to them,
than all the Trade of these three Nations.

To countermaund which, we have no other remedy, but to fly to their own
weapons, until better present, and that is,

1. To make all Rivers Naviagable as much as may be, and cut havigable Ditches
in all places where the ground and scitutation will permit, and where there are
no Rivers near unto the Towns already built, nor possibility of cutting
Navigable Ditches; it will be necessary to see where such Navigable Rivers or
Ditches may be made, and accordingly have them, cut with all convenient
expedition, and Towns and Cities built upon them in such manner, as the said
Rivers and Ditches may be brought through the said Towns and Cities is sundry
Channells, and that as much as is possible there be an outlet from the said
Rivers or Ditches into the Sea.

2. That without farther delay the Parliament order, and see it put in
execution, that in all the Fenns already drained, or to be drained, there be no
straggling Tenements or houses for any persons to live in, except for
Husbandmen, who are not to be far from their work and Calling, but that
there be Towns and Cities built at an indifferent distance, where People of
all other Occupations are to reside, and navigable Rivers and Ditches made from
one to another, and so into the Sea, which may be done with so many, and such
great advantages, as no part of the United Provinces do yet enjoy the like,
and make those Fenny Lands, which at present are unpeopled, and so little
worth, become more fruitful, more populous and rich, not only than any part
of England, but even of the whole World, as having the pre-eminence of being
designed so from the first foundation and beginning.

3. That the Parliament (before the Nurcery of Timber for building Ships be
quite destroyed, whereof there wants but little, I mean near the water side to
be had at easy rates, it being almost thrice as dcare as it was about thirty
years ago) do prohibit not only the cutting down of Timber for Shipping,
but that none capable of becoming fit for Shipping be used for building Houses
(I mean about the walls) in any part of England; nor for firing, but where
there is no possibility of having Sea-coale or Pit-coale at moderate rates; and
that the Nation be put to seek out and fetch from abroad all manner of Timber
to build Ships withal, before the day of our extremity, till which, if we
happen to deserre it, we shall then in likelihood not be able to attain it,
except by permission of our emulating, if not envying Neighbors, whose mercies
we may find to be Amboyna- like cruelties, and so much worse than their
vassalage, by how much that People, though subject to Excise and Taxes, may be
thought one of the happiest throughout the known world, in that they have not
only speedier Justice, than elsewhere, amongst themselves; but are by their
Powers, who find the advancing Trade to be the only true State Interest and
Policy, protected from all Foreign Injuries, and enjoy a full liberty of
Conscience, and by the wise management of their Overseers, have such
accommodations and advantages of Trading provided for them to their hand, as
that they scarce have a beggar amongst them, and generally live so comfortably
and contentedly, as no Nation does the like.

4. That some course be taken whereby the Money stock of the Nation may be
increased to such a plentifulnesse, as that moneys may be had for all men's
occasions at four or five in the hundred, according to the security to be
given, which the Act lately come out for reducing Interest to six in the
hundred cannot do; since, (besides the being compulsory, which perhaps were in
all cases best to be forborne, except where one man injured another in person
or estate): that Statute cannot increase the money stock of the Nation, but
rather contrariwise, as occasioning less money to be had at Interest, and if
the taking higher Interest were not punishable, Foreign Nations as they did
before these troubles, would likely bring in Moneys to put out at Interest, and
we had better pay twelve or thirteen in the hundred, as they do in Turkey, if
we cannot get it cheaper, than be quite without it. Now the Hollanders can
better a while longer forbear that benefit which they made in England by
Interest, than this Nation can their Trade, which like water being once stopped
in its usual course, makes its own way by another channel, and is not so
easily brought back again. Wherefore some other course must be fallen upon,
which has power of multiplying the said stock of the Nation, either
effectively or virtually to all intents and purposes; several whereof are
herein propounded, and have been upon other occasion more largely insisted on,
which had they been made use of, would long since have been succesfull against
all objections or oppositions.

5. That the Fishing Trade be fallen upon in earnest what ever it cost, without
which there can be no considerable nurcery or succession of Mariners, nor the
Trade of this Commonwealth become predominant, and if not predominant over
others, must become subservlent unto others.

6. That withal possible convenience we enlarge our Foreign Plantations, and
get farther footing in Barbary, East and West Indies, with other Countries
wheresoever it may be compassed. Not only that we may the better provide our
selves of Canvas for Sails, Masts, Timber, with all other things necessary for
Shipping within our own Dominions; but also in that a little spot of ground, as
England is, with its Dominions, if it do not enlarge them, in future
generations, I fear me, will be found inconsiderable in respect of Spain,
Portugal, the United Provinces, or any other European Nation, which shall have
arrived to, and be armed with sive or ten times a greater strength, power, and
riches, either from their Asian, African, or American Dominions.

Please to prohibit the killing Lambs for some few years, until Sheep become
multiplied to as great a number as ever: But if you desire to recover the
departing woollen Manifacture, or prevail with the Remainder not to bid adiu,
You must not only prevent the exporting Wools out of England, Ireland, and
Scotland, but must necessarily find means of compassing all the Woolls of
Spain for some years together, whereby Germany, France, Italy, and the Low
Countries, being disappointed, not only our own Run-awayes, but their
respective Manufactors will be necessitat^d to repair for England to be set a
work.

Be pleased, for the ^^^sent, to appoint a certain number of Free Ports (that
all ^^^^s may enjoy the like immunity so soon as it may be gran^^d without
lessning the Public Revenue) such as are most commodioully situated for
trading with Foreign Countries, (...) more equally distributing all manner of
Foreign Commod^ties throughout this Nation, as also for the b^^^^^ and cheaper
exporting the Manufactures and superfluities of this Common wealth, that all
Merchandise which shall be b^^^^^^ into any of them, and afterward for want of
a good M^^^^t again exported, may be free from Custom and Exci^^; A course
which almost all Sea- Towns in Europe have more or less made use of at some
time or other, as no slight Stratagem to make them become populous, and for
furniming themselves with all manner of Commodities at easiest rates, because
being once brought thither, Merchants will rather sell them at indifferent
prices, than carry them to another place, with so much more charge, danger of
the Seas, and loss of time.

Let the Natives of any Foreign Country, who shall come to trade with us, be
equally free, as to Taxes and such like immunities, with the Natives of this
Commonwealth, which will of necessity induce them to take up their habitations
amongst us, who else cannot make such benefit thereof, as otherwise they might;
Now righteous gains and profits are the Rule whch all wise men steer by, and
the end at which they aim; and even such Forraigners as shall resolve to reside
and live amongst us, will get the advantage of the others that only come to
sell their goods and return again, who in such cases cannot take the best of
the Market, neither to sell their Commodities, nor make returns: But if it be
said, that these n mble pated Forraigners will hereby eat, or work the Natives
of this Commonwealth out of their Trades and Callings; I answer, that such
Foreigners can only prejudice such Natives as are negligent, less
industrious, or that use false arts in their ways and Trades; For if the
Natives be but equally ingenious and upright in their Trades and Dealings, they
being versed and settled therein already, will have the start and advantage
enough of any Foreigners that shall afterward begin and fall into the same
Trades: But if some Forreiners be more nimble, ingenious, and industrious in
their ways of Trading, than generally the Natives of this Land; may it not be
consistent with, nay even a special demonstration of the Wisdom of our
Governors to encourage such active spirited Foreigners to a cohabitation with
us, whom the Fishermen Manifactors and Artificers of Foreign Nations will
certainly accompany, for all follow and depend upon the Merchant, whereby their
offspring in the next generation become Natives like our selves? And if by such
course any of the less ingenious Natives of this Land happen to be outgone in
their own Trades and Callings, let them apply themselves unto some other which
requires less ingenuity and activenes, as they ought to have done at first;
and will not the industry and ingenuity of such Foreigners be a good lesson
and example to us, and contribute much to the enriching and accomodating the
whole Nation in general?

Be pleased that secure Harbors and Ports be made in as many places as can
possibly be round about England, and in each of them a strong impregnable
Castle that may command the Port or Harbor, and that in each of these Castles
or Forts there be Storehouses, with all manner of Provisions and Ammunition
for shipping laid in at the cheapest rates, to furnlsh both the Commonwealths
and all Merchants ships upon occasion, but especially in the Isle of Wight and
Harwich, or in any other place where the Commonwealths men of war may ride
or lie at Anchor securely all the year long, and upon Intelligence of an Enemy
upon our own Coast or elsewhere, with all winds and weathers, from one safe
Harbor or other, put forth to Sea, and get upon them before they be awares.
Whereas at present our Enemies may (and it is possible we shall feel it
hereafter more sadly) every night in the year, If not even by day time, come
ashore almost round about the Coast, burn, fire, sack, make our People
captives, kill, with what else they please, and be gone again, before their
Country Neighbors which dwell so straggling, can come in to help them, or our
men of War get out to Sea, to prevent it, or rescue them And that in all these
places there be Docks for building Ships all the year long, and that being
built they may continue there in a safe Harbor, until there be just occasion
to put to Sea; and that when cause requires, they may be found ready to put out
to S^^ with all winds and weathers, and being at Sea, have Provisions and
Necessaries of al sorts, sent them from thence, both speedier and cheaper;
leaving nothing unattempted for securing Ships riding at Anchor in the Downs,
about Sandwich, or the Isle of Tennet, where a secure Harbor would be more
advantageous, then in any place of England.

That Mariners be encouraged by certain Immunities to take up their dwellings
in the Isle of Wight, Harwich, and in all such places especially where the
Ships usually Winter, or are usually laid up in when they come from Sea, that
they may be there in readiness when the Ships go to Sea again: by which
course most of them may be discharged so soon as the Ships get in, and not
need to be embarked until the Ships be ready to put to Sea, which will save
some months pay unto them yearly; for the time which the States Ships spend in
expecting Tide, Wind, and Weather, in getting up or down the River of Thames,
and out to Sea, and that so many thousand Seamen as the Commonwealth shall
have need of, be kept in continual Pay all the year long, to be always in
readiness when they shall be called upon, and to have their Diet over and
above when they are in Employment; after which manner I believe the
Commonwealth may be furnished at cheaper rates then at present, and Pressing
or compelling them prevented; which, whether for Sea, or Land-service is a very
great, if not the most eminent body of our former bondage, and next to the
degree of Bondslaves, liable to be sold in a Market, and no where in common
practice throughout Christendom, except in England. If You have money You
cannot want men, and You may have money enough if You will Your selves make use
of such harmless ways as have been propounded to You.

Prevent the over-ballancing of Trade, Encourage the Importation of Bullion and
Foreign Species of Moneys; and Regulate the Marchandizing Exchange, which
because they are the most mysterious parts of Trade, I shall crave leave to
enlarge a little upon them.

Moneys were invented to be a measure or price of all things, and to prevent
the carrying up and down more bulkie Commodities to Barter or Exchange
withal, which was first in use, and for that purpose moneys were made of the
scarcest, sinest, and purest Metal, that it might be so much more
transportable to and fro.

Then as the World went on more refining it self, Exchanges were found out, as
well to prevent the exportation of moneys out of one Country into another, as
also the danger and troublesomenesse of carrying moneys to and fro within each
several Country and Jurisdiction: upon which respect the most pollitick and
expert Merchants in lieu of money send nothing but a small piece of Paper,
called A Bill of Exchange, which being subscribed by men of credit, is thought
equivalent to so much money as the Bill of Exchange engages for. But whereas
Exchanges were especially contrived to prevent the exportation of moneys out of
one Country into another, through regardlesnesse of our Magistrates, the said
Exchanges have been so Managed by the selfe-seeking Interest of particular
Merchants, as did not only prevent the importing of Bullion, or moneys into
this Land, but necessitated the exportation of our moneys, both Silver and
Gold.

Moneys are likely carried out of England.
I. Either because there is more profit to be got by our moneys abroad, then
by remitting them by Exchange, or employing them in Commodities. Or, II.
Because it may be most commodious for Travelers, or other Passengers to Carry
them: Or, III. Because such passengers are ignorant both in Employing them, and
remitting or returning them by Exchange. But, IV. And especially, because all
the Corn which is brought by Strangers, and all the Fish which the Hollanders
take upon our Coast or elsewhere, and sell in England, as at Yarmouth, Plymouth,
etc. are sold for ready moneys, and those moneys in likelihood all exported,
etc.
The gain on transporting moneys may proceed.
1. Either because our Commodities are grown dearer here in England to be
bought. Or, 2. Grown cheaper abroad in Foreign Parts to be sold. Or, 3.
Because that they give more for our Moneys then the Intrinsecall value, to melt
them in Foreign mints, or make them current in Payments above their value.
And all these three respects will vanquish if we can but keep our Trade in
Balance, or rather enlarge our Exportation of Commodities, above our
Importation, and establish the Exchange between us, and other Nations
according to the Par.

The undervaluing our moneys by Exchange, the accommodating Passengers with
moneys wherever they go, who desire not to be troubled with Commodities
though they might get somewhat by them, And the supplying their ignorance both
in employing, and returning them may be done by engaging all Merchants to
observe the Par in their exchanging according to certain Tables wherein the
intrinsecall value of Foreign Coins in relation to ours is to be published;
and if this fail, it may infallibly be effected, by constituting a Public
Exchanger, or an Agent of the Commonwealths, who may be obliged to Furnish all
Passengers with the full value of their moneys in most principal places where
they go, as likewise all Merchants with whatsoever Sums they desire; in
which case men will not hazard the danger of exporting their moneys, and if
they do and be discovered must be made to pay for it without remission.

And when this course is settled, then it is propounded, That all persons be
again prohibited exportation of moneys; and that if the Captain or Master,
Masters Mate, Purser, Master Gunner, or Gunners Mate, or Boatswayne do
contrive or assist the Exportation of moneys, or but know thereof, and do not
discover it, it shall be Confiscation of the Ship, besides double penalty to
each of the parties so assisting, or concealing; and that the accuser or
discoverer have one of what is recovered, provided it be within five years
after the fact was done. Within which time if any of the parties shall accuse
the other, and make it appear by one or two Witnesses, or otherwise the
accuser for the first time shall not only free himself from any penalty, but
enjoy one half as discoverer. And the having above such a Sum of money
aboard any Ship or Vessel, so long time together, and in such places, shall be
understood a guiltiness of an Exportation thereof. And if any other Mariner
or person belonging to the Ship or Vessel shall assist, or conceal the
Exportation as above said, such Mariners or person shall forfeit all his Wages
then due to him, and if he have none due, be Liable to a Fine, etc.

Now for enabling the Public Exchanger, or furnishing the Commonwealths Agent
with a stock of money and Credit, whereby he may furnish all men's occasions by
Exchange, according to the Par, as aforesaid: It is necessary that he have a
Stock, and how that may be raised gratis has been made out to several Worthy
Members, and shall be further demonstrated when required. Then,

If the Commonwealth keep a Correspondent, or Banker in Paris, Antwerp,
Amsterdam, Roterdam, and in such like principal places of Trade, and have a
stock of money, or Credit with each of them, their Public Exchanger may either
return moneys upon them, or receive Charges from them according to the Par. or
intrinsecal value, which will hinder transportation, and this can be no damage
or loss unto the Parliament, because their Agents deal only according to the
true worth of the Coins in themselves at the Mint, what ever the denominations
be, or however they be Lightened or Embased: and besides

1. If all moneys Delivered or Received by Exchange, pass through this Public
Exchanger or Banckers hands, or be ordered to be paid in Bank, you may see who
are Deliverers, and who Takers, and to and from what parts moneys are remitted,
and received, and by whom: and by this Balance of Exchanges you may see how
the pulse of the balance of Trade beats, by whom, and from whence the
Mischiefs concerning the same proceed, and be enabled to redress them.

2. As by an exact rule in the Custom House you may know what Goods each
Forreigner Imports and Exports; so here you may see what moneys he remits, or
receives and make a balance; for Strangers may be thought to be the greatest
Exporters of our moneys, and those Seamen, Chiefly dealing likewise much in
Merchandise. Now til this be more fully made out by practice, it is humbly
moved,

First, That no Goldsmiths or other person upon great Penalties be suffered to
melt any of the Commonwealths Coin. Secondly, That no Gold and Silver Lace be
made in England, but of such Silver and Gold thread or Plate, as is imported,
until we see the Bullion begin again to be imported into England. Thirdly,
That no moneys be permitted to be sent into Ireland, New England, Barbados,
New Foundland, or any of our other Plantations, until Bullion begin to come in
again. Fourthly, That all Gold and Silver Mines formerly discovered within
this Land, may be now further searched into, and others more nearly sought
after, for supplying us with a Money Stock of our own, until we can bring in
one from abroad. Fifthly, That there be no pence nor half pence made of
Silver, because so subject to be worn out, broken, and quite lost. Sixthly,
That it be afresh declared what Quantity of the Commonwealths Coin, and how
much Foreign Coin every Ship may carry for her own Store or Provision,
against all wants or accidents, etc. and how they are to be furnished, etc.
against all Immergent occasions.
Be pleased to erect a Court of Merchants for the speedy determining all
Controversies about buying and selling, or any other emergencies rela erect a
Court of Merchants for the speedy determining all Controversies about buying
and selling, or nay other emergencies relating to Trade and Navigation.

That Bonds, Bills of Exchange, or other Bills of Debt, be made irrevocably
assignable from one man to another, as often as the last Assign shall please,
together with the delivery of the said Bonds or Bills of Debt, which will
virtually multiply the stock of this Nation, as to trading to all intents and
purposes, especially if you can induce the People by advantages to a voluntary
registring thereof, for which purpose only there is a short Proposal ready
prepared to be produced upon command.

But above all other Engines or Instruments, the greatest pre-eminence is due
unto a Banck, which has a capacity of infallible preventing the exportation of
our own moneys, and necessitating the Importation of Bullion and Foreign
Coins, it will prevent the passing of false or clipped money, with the wear and
wast of money by telling it; save all the time now spent in telling money;
Overruled the Merchandising Exchange, whereby the Merchants of this Nation have
been merely cheated in all parts of the world, where exchanging by Bills of
Exchange is practiced. It is this only that can reduce and keep the Grand
Balance of Trade in favor of this Nation, by preventing the Importation of a
greater quantity of Foreign Commodities, than we export of Native; It is
capable of multiplying the stock of the Nation, for as much as concerns
trading in Infinitum: In breife, it is the Elixir or Philosophers Stone, to
which all Nations, and every thing within those Nations must be subservient,
either by fair means or by foul.

Be pleased to let the Bill for a Country Register at last to pass, which has
been so many years preparing, and yet retarded, no doubt by some private
respects or Interests; I mean to pass in such a manner, as that a man being
to make a purchase of Lands or Houses, may in a quarter of an hour, and for a
twelve-penny matter or thereabouts, see who is the true Proprietor thereof, and
what Judgments, Mortgages, and other Encumbrances there are upon them; which
with the voluntary Registring of Bonds and Bills of debt, as aforesais, will
prevent three fourth parts of all Law-suites, that otherwise will happen, and
shorten such as shall be begun hereafter.

But what is it I have with so much confidence affirmed? Is there so great
complaint of the want of moneys, especially at such low Interest, as were
requisite to drive Trade withal? And will the assigning over Bonds and Bills of
debt irrevocably, virtually multiply the stock of the Nation so much, or so
often, as the innumerable Bonds and Bills so many several times turned or
assigned over from one man to another amount unto? And has a Banck yet a
farther capacity, even of increasing it unto an Infinity, as I may say, by
multiplying it virtually, as to trading complete in all its dimentions and
perquisits, to whatsoever sum a Nation can possibly stand in need of, though
it were to engrosse and monopolize the whole Trade of the world unto
themselves, as much and as effectually, as if all the money of the world were
effective brought into that one Nation? And is it possible that the numberless
Lawsuites may thus easily be prevented, the Remainder shortened, and the
unmercifull expensivenes abated, and will we not make use thereof? Will such
easy and obvious means be still rejected, or not made use of for multiplying
our money-stock, and for increasing Trade, which only will, and without which
nothing can revive and repair this wasted Nation? I beseech Your Honors to
pardon this seeming familiar manner of Interrogating, uttered in much
tenderness, and with all submissivenesse tendered to Your gracious censure and
acceptance: and yet I may not, nor can I smoother how heavily and sharply the
Proceedings of the Courts of Westminster, and even that of Parliament pinches
us Commoners, which will be easier digested, and sooner forgot, if it be
remedied hereafter.

Please to take into consideration how all the remaining Fenns may be drained,
and all Commons enclosed, which would produce a great increase of all things
that the Land brings forth, provided it be done with so large alotments unto
all people that have any interest or present benefit thereby, as they may be
gainers by such enclosures, if they will be industrious.

Confirm the Laws in being with a cleerer explanation of them, for
encouragement of all new Inventions and Improvements, that each Improver and
Inventor may know what advantage he may expect, and how it is to be determined
and secured unto him, without so much attendance and charge.

Consider whether it be according to the Law of God, or a well ordered
Commonwealth, that the Creditors Children or Heirs of Malefactors should be
punished for the sins of their Parents, Predecessors or Debitors, and how
heavily this has layn upon many well affected to the State within these eight
years: If it be said that this is done the rather to keep people in obedience
to the Laws, and that many desperate persons, who regard not their own lives,
have notwithstanding for their wises and Childrens sakes forborne to commit such
flagitious crimes, to prevent the ruin which would have befaln them also; I
easily believe it, but do not see how it can be lawful, to do the evil of
punishing Children for their Fathers offenses, that the good of restraining
their Fathers from committing such offenses may be compassed thereby.

Please to prohibit the no less delusive and irrational (as we stand
perplexed between Common Law and Chauncerie) than unconscionable way of penary
Bonds and Mortgages, which though they always find favor at Common Law, yet
a man always looses by them, and shall never have them made good in
Chauncerie, no nor so much as his Interest, damages, and full charges allowed
him. And if an honest man that has a Bond, with a double penalty, shall apply
himself first unto the Chauncerie, desiring the Justice of that Court for his
Principal and Interest only, alleging that he is necessitated thereunto, and
to become first Plaintiff there, or else after so many expensive terms at
Common Law, to be made Defendant, and hung up by an Injunction upon formal
Cavills and suggestions for several years together; some sycophant or other
about that Court might possibly put an evil Interpretation upon such
proceedings, and endeavor to have the Bill dismissed; whereas if it were
admitted, it might likely come to a hearing, and be decreed in a year, in
regard by this course the greatest part of those formal suggestions, which
delay the Hearing are prevented; whereas if between Common Law and Chauncerie,
two, three, four years or more are spun out, if the Creditor dies his
children or heirs are less able to carry on the suit, though it be upon a
Bond signed and sealed in presence of a hundred witnesses, yet if the Debtor
have but the Impudence to deny the payment, the Heirs must be put to prove it,
and if they cannot tell the very person that paid the money, or if he be dead,
for all that I can learn, it is in the pleasure of the Judges to make them
loose their money; and if the debtor dye before the business come to be decreed,
and satisfaction gained, if he left a personal estate, that is generally in
great part imbeasled; If land, that is made appear not liable to pay debts; so
gracious are our Laws, and so favorable is the Interpretation of them to such
as stand in most need of being releived, and instead of penalties in Bonds, if
the time of payment be elapsed, declare the Interest to be due, or such greater
damages as the Creditor shall make proof of to have suffered for want of his
moneys, besides full costs, if not double; and in stead of Mortgages that such
Lands be interiourly engaged for payment of Principal Interest or damages and
costs as aforesaid, and so much thereof only sold as will satisfy the same.

Be pleased to Enact all Wills and Testaments to be Registered in the Country
Register, within eight days after the decease of the Testator, or that the
Will be found or brought to light, and that no person be permitted to dispose
of, or so much as remove any goods of the Testators, until the Will be
Registered and proved by the Country Magistrate, or such other nearest
Judicature, as this Supreme Court shall appoint for determination of all other
causes, which will much prevent the embaselling of the estate to defraud just
Creditors, and secure the Remainder to the Legatees and Heirs.

Please to enact that single Bills once proved or acknowledged, be as valid as
Bonds, or any other Obligation, and that together with Bonds they may have
present execution.

That Merchants and Shopkeepers Books of Account be of unquestionable credit
for liquidating or clearing debts, being demanded within a certain term of
years, as in Your Wisdoms shall seem convenient, unless such Merchant or
Shopkeeper be proved a knave, or that strong presumption appear of some
mistake in relation to the Account in question.

That no man be arrested till after Judgment, unless upon clear evidence of
intended removal of his usual habitation, or concealment of his goods or
person upon affidavit, and that suddenly upon a Judgment, even in that
instant, execution be granted both against person and estate of what sort so
ever.

That all deceitfulness in Spinning, Carding, Weaving, Dying, with all other
frauds of what kind soever, in any manner of Commodities or dealings, which
are exceeding destructive to Trading, be enquired after, and prevented in the
future.

That all new Manufactures, Handicraft my steries and Trades, practiced in
other parts, or else with greater facility or exquisitnes, and not as yet
brought into England, at lest with its perfections, as Dying of Blacks in
Holland and Germany, Crimsons in Venice, Watering and Chambletting of Silks
equal to those of Florence, Bononia, Lucca, Venice, and other parts of Italy;
making all sorts of Linnins, especially for Sails for Ships, and the like,
which will yield large matter to work upon, and may be all safely and
advantagiously undertaken with advice and direction of such as are well versed
in all sorts of Commodities and Trading; and (if we regard our own safety and
plenty, both which are easiest purchased by purchasing of Trade) ought to be
thoroughly pursued, though to loss at first; And there is scarce any Art,
Manifacture, or Workmanship in any Foreign Country, which with Integrity and
Industry of the Overseers, may not in a short time become English, in greater
perfection and exquisitnesse, than in any other Country, because I do not
find all these advantages which have been tendered to this Nation, discovered
to any one, nor to all the Nations throughout the Universe, nor such diligence
so exactly practiced as might be, which will still yield Employment to all
numbers of People, though they multiply beyond President or belief, provided
they have but elbow-roome to dwell by one another.

Be pleased to Erect Lombards or Bancks of Lone for furnishing all people with
moneys at Interest upon pawnes, personal or Land security, at reasonable
rates, which will not only increase Trading exceedingly, but also be of very
great accommodation unto all others of whatsoever profession: and the same
Banck to be obliged to furnish all poor people that shall desire it as 20.s at
one time upon pawn gratis, to be repayd at six months, or the pawnes to be
sold: and that the same Banck be also obliged to take off at certain
reasonable rates all such Commodities as poor people shall find remaining
upon their hands, and through deadness of trading cannot find to sell them
off, whereby (...) buy themselves victuals, and continue in their Callings,
which being well managed by persons well versed in the prices of Commodities,
with the seasons when, and the places where to sell them, may rather turn to
the increase than detriment of the said Banck.

Be pleased to Erect a certain number of Workhouses in all Cities and great
Towns throughout the Nation, whereto, all People, whether men or women, boys
or girls that cannot provide better for themselves, may have recourse, and be
set to work, of one sort or other, which persons of the meanest capacity, may
easily attain to, and perform, at such usual wages, of some small matter
under that which People of the like professions do give unto their Journey-men
or women, provided they do the same work, both for quantity and quality, that
they may live comfortably thereon, and lay up somewhat by their frugality, as
may furnish Tools, and purchase a stock to set up for themselves afterward:
This will not only keep multitudes of People from stealing and other lewd
courses, but much increase the Manufacture and Handicrafts workmanship of the
Nation: Nay, how many hundreds, if not thousands, would such a course as this
have saved, who within these ten years, have even been starved to death, and
merely dyed of want, or griese at least, because they had but little means of
relief, and in a continual fear of wanting necessary food and raiment?

Many of these Proposalls which I have taken boldness to make unto Your
Honors, I know to be of very Public and great concernment, but this as being
an Act of Mercy, extending to very many, and they in greatest extremity of
want, I deem to surpass all the rest, as more savouring of Humanity, and more
approaching to the ways of God himself. This being once established, who ever
shall be found a begging, may be confined hither to be kept working a certain
reasonable term for bare food and raiment: And though this may seem to be
matter of charge, and at least must require a stock to begin withal, yet it is
capable of being so managed and improved, as had I but a lease of my life for
five years, I would not doubt, to have some such work a foot, as besides the
reliese which I here hold out unto the needy of the Nation should have been
sufficiently beneficial to the undertaker and it might have been attempted
long ago, when I was likelier to live to manage it, and joy in the success
thereof, could I have attained to an equality of Justice, or so much favor as
a per^^^ obnoxious to Delinquency has had.

This Workhouse might likewise take care of all Children, boys or girls
which are found about the streets, as also lame and blind people who are not
able to help themselves, which here, both according to their capacities and
abilities, may be set awork; and every man or woman with one arm or leg, only
being kept at work, may earn so much as will maintain them in a comfortable
condition.

Then I hope it will be found necessary to appoint certain Trustees or
Commissioners, of untainted Integrity, and free from Covetousness, who may
have Power of taking into their protection and care, all Orphans and their
Estates, to see the managing and Improving of them to the best advantage during
their minority, and to be accountable to them when they come to years: These
are a People who cannot help themselves, whereby not only their estates
oftentimes become a prey to men of evil consciences, but they themselves,
destitute of pious and discreet education, do too too often miscarry in their
persons.

That Public Schools where there are none already be erected in all parts of
England, with competent stipends to so many head-Masters and under Ushers as
shall be requisite in each place, to which all poor people may be free to send
their Children, whether boys or girls, to be taught gratis, both to write and
read at least, and such Youths as are designed by their friends to a course of
learning, be there instructed until they be sit for the Universities, or any
other kind of Clerkship. And because Divine Providence has cast our lot in an
Island, which cannot subsist securely without Commerce with other Nations,
which must necessarily be carried on by Merchants and Seafaring men, who by
their Professions are called out to cross the Seas, and see the Wonders of the
deep: As also in that this Land is very subject to high Waters in all parts,
as that there is no traveling about our just occasions without being
endangered thereby; I should propound First, That in stead of putting
Malefactors to their Clergy, they may learn to save their lives by swimming.

And secondly, That these Public Schoolmasters may be Engaged to see all their
Scholars learn to swim, and that all others, Parents or Guardians, be
obliged to teach their Children elsewhere to read, write, and swim, or to
send them to these Free-Schooles to be taught: The benefit of Writing and
Reading, though it be not sufficiently considered by all Parents, and many
poor people have not accommodate opportunity, and competency of means to get
their Children taught, yet generally it is understood to be a pretty portion
for Children that have nothing else to trust to, to read and write in some
pretty perfection, and therefore do what they can to get their Children
educated accordingly, but Free-Schooles are so rare throughout this Land, and
Writing-Masters so weak in their Frofession, as most Children and Youths by
this means come short of that perfection which otherwise they might ataine to;
And besides, whereas if the Children of the poorer sort be of any bigness as
to become serviceable to their Parents, they cannot well be spared all day
long, which the Parents are forced not withstanding to dispense with, and
children to spend between going so far to School, and returning, together
with the eight hours which are usually spent in the School, the whole day;
when as the Master of Usher cannot attend or teach every individual Scholar
one whole hour in a day; Now if but one, two, or three hours a day were set
them, I mean to each particular Scholar, and so some appointed to come at one
hour, and some at another, and the Master or Usher to apply themselves to each
Scholar in particular when he comes, the School being supposed to be near,
the Scholar might quickly be at home again to conn his lesson, or practice by
himself, until he be aweary, I mean so long daily as shall be requisite, and
bring him to a competent perfection, as to Reading and Writing, and have the
remainder of the day to serve his poor Parent in, which will become as a
Recreation to himself: But as to this feat of swimming, that all youths should
be trained up to it, I know it is a new Proposal or Novelty, however when well
weighed, I doubt not but it will be well approved of; and being so easily
attained, and of such use, as that few men who have been good swimmers, and
made often Voyages either by Sea or Land, but first or last have not only
saved their own lives, and other men, perhaps more than once, but even the Ship
with all her Seamen, Passengers and goods, which many times are lost by the
mariners deserting her through faint-heartednesse, because they are not expert
in swimming, and hastily betaking themselves into the boat to get ashoare,
whereas if they tarryed aboard so long as the Ship could be kept above Water,
they might possibly save the Ship and goods by pumping, and themselves at last
by swimming, when there were no other remedy. Which how true it is, is manifest
by the often meeting Ships at Sea forsaken of their men upon springing of a
Leake, that within a few days, perhaps hours, must have sunk for want of
pumping, had they not been so met withal and saved. And besides, upon
occasion of each aproaching danger, expert Swimmers are less perplexed, which
may justly be interpreted a far greater deliverance, than even from death it
self by drowning.

That Physicians and Chyrurgions be appointed in every County throughout the
Nation, particularly to every proportionable division of this great City of
London, at the Public charge, who may be obliged once a day to visit and
administer according to their respective Professions, to whomsoever in that
Division shall desire it, without any other fee or consideration, but what the
State allows them.

And lastly, that Hospitalls be erected, and endowed, in every County and
proportionable Division, to which it may be free for all poor people to
repair for taking Physic, as well to prevent sickness before it comes, as
when it has seized on them, at the sole charge and attendance of the Hospital.

And now if any body of a Judas-like spirit or disposition shall object, that I
herein express my self a very unprofitable servant unto the Commonwealth, in
tendering to Them such chargeable Propositions.

I answer, that since the greatest part of this, or of any other Nation, are
contented to be subject, poor, and labor all day long, that others may more
securely Command, be which in the abundance of the Creature, and live at ease;
That such, the Powers or Great Ones of a Nation, even in discretion to
themselves, can do no less, than contrive and cast about, how such Subjects,
servants, and laborers of theirs, who after a sense may be said to be their
very strength and riches in the abstract, be so provided for in all respects,
especially of sickness, which makes them so helpless in themselves, and
against which their small pittance of portion in this world cannot possibly
make provision, as that they may the better be enabled, not only to continue
strong in their subjection, serving and laboring for the Powers and Great
Ones, but that they may live under, and go thorough it cheerfully, and be
prevented as to all thoughts and contrivances of change and Innovation: And yet
because if all this were to be compassed without charge unto the State, the
Nation might likelier enjoy the benefit thereof the sooner; I may not longer
forbear to assert, and be engaged upon my life too, to make it out, if I were
called thereto; That there is no one of these Proposalls, nor all of them
together, but may be made demonstrable unto any ordinary capacity, and by this
Commonwealth be established and put in execution within a very very few years,
without greater (and perhaps with less) charge than they are at, at present,
and free from all manner of danger and inconvenience whatsoever; And being once
effected, not only prevent so many of the Nation in their Importunities for a
new Representative; but both dispose them to be willing, and put You into a
capacity of resigning freely that Authority wherewith You have been so long
invested, with Safety and Honor to your selves, and those that have adhered to
You. All which is humbly submitted to Your Honors deep Wisdoms to be
considered on before it be too late.
