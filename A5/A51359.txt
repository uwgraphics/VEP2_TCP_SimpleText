THE AUTHOR TO THE Courteous Reader.
IN the continual and laborious Service, for the space of five and twenty years
(in which time, I have always exercised the Charge of an Ingeneer, as well in
the Wars of Germany, Dalmatia, and in the Defense of Candia:) Amongst other my
Mititary Observations, I have always much admired, the excellent Invention and
prodigious Effects of Great Artillery. Of which having Composed a small
Treatise for my own Use, which coming accidentally into the hands of my
Friends, and being by them dispersed in Manuscripts into most Cities of Italy,
I have at last by their importunities, and especially the earnest solicitation
of my worthy Brother, and famous Mathematician, Doctor Segnior Andrea,
permitted it to be published for the Use and Benefit of those who are curious
in Artillery. Being a Sacrifice which I make, not to Ambition, but for the
Friendship and Vtility of Soldiers. Some, perhaps have done better, but have
enlarged so much for Ornameut and Elegancy, that they have made their Volumes
almost as heavy, as the Artillery of which they Treat.

I therefore have writ that which I judge sufficient for the knowledge of a
Soldier, and as succinct as possibly I eould, being not willing to be tedious
in things less necessary. As for me, I never was to see the Artillery in China;
but in this Part of the World, in which I have practiced, I have not been
wanting to see and examine, as much as could be, the best Proportions and
Operations; And have always sought afer the Acquaintance, Practice, Advice, and
Directions of the Eminent Professors in this Art, and have read most of those
Books which have been written of this Subject.

Accept this my Military Fatigue, and if you find any opposition, or that in
any part I have not been sufficiently plain, I pray you come to me, whilst I am
yet ^^ving, and you shall receive all satisfaction.

EXAMPLE I.
WHere the longer Axis of the E^^ipsis is (...) and the shorter. 78; Because
(...) Table (...) made for such Elleips's, enter wi^. 78, the Perifery of that
Elleipsis will be 2.^38.

EXAMPLE II.
The longer Axis 1, the shorter. 4382, I enter with. 4^ gives 2.3371: Then to
find the part answering to. 71, say^ If 100 give. 117; what shall. 71 give?
Answ.. 83, which added to 2.3371, gives 2.3454 for the Perifery desired.

EXAMPLE III.
Where the longer Axis is 388, the shorter 280, first say, 388: 280:: 1.000:
Answ.. 721, seek in the Table for. 72, it gives 2.7166; then say, 1.0000:
2.7166:: 388: Answ. 1054.06, which is the Circumference desired.

EXAMPLE IV.
The longer Diameter 32.54, the shorter 18.64; say; 32.54: 18.64:: 1.000: 572;
to which in the Table answers 2.5114, and the part proportional for 2 is 26,
which makes the whole 2.5140; then 1.000: 2.5140:: 32.54: 81.805 the Perifery
required. The Area or Superficies of an Elleipsis is easily got by this Rule.
As the longer Diameter, is to the shorter: So is the Circle of the longer
Diameter, to the Elleipsis.

I have made above 45000 Arithmetical Operations for this Table, and am now
well pleased it is finished. Some perhaps may find shorter ways, as I believed
I had my self, 'till advised otherwise by the truly Honorable the Lord
BRUNCKER. I therefore pursued the Rules given by me, in that Contemplation of
the Elleipsis Printed in my Arithmetic, taking 100 Elleipsis betwixt that
which falls upon the Diameter equal in this case to 2.0000 the first in the
Table, and the greatest which is the Circle 3.1402 the last.

THE FIRST PART. Of Artillery in General.
CHAP. I.
Of the Names and Description of Great Guns, and of their Parts.
THis Military Engine, of which we intend to treat, came to be called Bombarda,
Gun, Cannon, and Artillery; (whence come Gunners, Cannoneers, and
Artillery-Men, being those that do Manage them;) Bom^, from Bombo, a
resounding Noise, and (...) its sensible Effect, burning whilst it is ^loyed;
Cannone or Cannon, from the like^ it holds with its Canna (Bore or Concavity)
the Form or Frame being naturally long, ^ound, and hollow in the midst;
Artigleria, from (Artiglio) the Tallons or Claws of ravenous Fowls, perhaps
because its Shot flying far off dismembers and tears in pieces all that it
meets; whence some Natures of this Machine are called Smeriglii, long-winged
Hawks; Falconi, Falconets; Passavolanti, swift-flyi^ Arrows.

Artillery, or Great Guns, are nothing mo^ than a long round piece of Brass or
Iron bor^ up, formed with Art and Proportion to offer^ far off, with a Ball of
Iron, Stone, or any ^tificial Substance, Charged with Gun powd^ which is in an
instant fired within. They w^ first put in practice by the Venetians aga^ the
Genoueses before Chiozza, in the Ye^ 1376.

The Concavity, Anima.
Chase, Concave of the Piece, is that hollow or empty part in wh^ they put the
Charge, as in the Figure ((...) Fig. 1.
ACKM.

The Mouth or Muzzle, is the extremity o^ the Concave, by which you load and
unload the Piece, ASC.

The Calibre, is the Diameter of the Mouth* AC.

The Touch hole, is that little hollow V^ which passes from the outward or
unequal: perficies of the Piece to the very Concave (...) Chamber, from that end
or part where the Chase is enclosed, made to give fire to the Powder within, IK.

The Culatta.
Breech, is of solid Metal, which inclo^ seth the Extremity of the Chase about
the Touch hole.

The Codone.
Cascabel, or outmost Pommel or But^ of the Breech, which serves for a Hand^ to
manage the Artillery, RQ.

The Trunnions, or pieces of Metal which fall or stand out of the exterior
Superficies of the Gun, and placed about the middle, by which the Piece lies
equally balanced in her Carriage, and upon which it moves, GH.

Maniglions, or Dolphins, after the German ^nner, are two Handles, which are
placed ^on the Back or uppermost part of the Piece ^ar the Trunnions, and near
upon the Cen^r of Gravity of the Piece, to mount and dismount it with ease, a b.

The Body of the Piece, is that part which is ^omprehended betwixt the Center
of the Trun^ions and the Cascabel, which ought always to be more fortified than
the other part, GR.

Volata.
Vacant Cylinder, is that part of the Piece which is comprehended betwixt the
Center of the Trunnions and the Muzzle, GB.

The Gioia della Bocca.
Frees, or Muzzle-Ring, is that ^k Cornish which incompasseth the unequal
^erficies of the Piece near the Mouth, E. ^he Base-Ring, or great Ring next the
Touchhole, is that thick Cornish which binds ^e unequal Superficies of the
Piece, NRO.

The other Rings are the Reinforced-Ring, T; ^e Trunnion-Ring, F; and
Cornish-Ring, Y.

The Line of the Cylinder, is a direct Line, which one imagins, described along
the Chase (...) the lowest part of the concave Superficies (...) the Piece,
which Line is parallel to the ^ddle of the Chase of the said Piece, MC. (...)

The Line of Metal, or Cornishes, is a Line drawn above the Piece, touching
both Cornishes, N and E.

The Dispart Line of the Piece, is the difference betwixt the Semidiameters of
the Muzzle Ring and Base Ring, or a Line drawn from the utmost top of the
Base-Ring, parallel (...) the Chase of the Piece, the Dispart being the nearest
distance betwixt the same LIne and the top of the Muzzle-Ring, EZ.

The Vent of the Piece, is the Space betwixt the Shot and the concave
Superficies of the Piece, or the difference betwixt the Diameter of the Shot
and Mouth of the Piece, c d.

The Chamber in all fortified Pieces, is that part of its Chase toward the
Touch-hole^ equally large, nor narrower in one part (...) in another, forasmuch
as it receives the Powder, and a Wad or Tampion of an (...) bigness.

The Campa^ia.
Chamber in Drakes, and old tape^ Pieces, is not equally large in all its
parts, (...) narrower toward the Touchhole.

Moscolo, is a moveable Chamber, which on takes up and joins to the Bore of
certain Petrieroes, by means of the Braga.

Braga, in some Petrieroes, is a Ring of Iron that holds firm the Moscolo or
moveable Chamber to the Concavity of the Piece, and fir^ the Breech to the
Piece.

The Names of the Parts of Carriages, (...) also the most usual Instruments, we
shall spea^ of in their proper places.

CHAP. II.
Of the Mixture of Metals for Ordnance.
ARtillery are very often made of Iron, especially the Petrieroes de Braga, and
other natures, which are used aboard Merchant-Ships; but the most proper and
most used Metal is that called Brass, compounded of Copper, Tin, and another
part of Latten. Copper alone is too soft, the Tin gives it hardness, but too
much makes it brittle; the Latten unites, and gives an alloy to the other two.

To form a Proportion of these Metals to make Guns of, will be various
according to diverse Authors.

Some to every Hundred Weight of pure Copper, give 20 lb. of Bell-Metal, or in
lieu 10 lb. of soft Tin.

Others to every Hundred Weight of Copper give 10 lb. of Latten, and 8 lb. of
soft Tin.

Copper. Latten. Tin. Others mix together 100 10 8 100 10 5 100 8 5

Others, to every 100 lb. of Copper 10, 8, or 7 lb. of Tin, without the other;
and these two last are estimated best.

But the best and most proper Materials will be the Copper alone beaten.

Some Guns are made with their Soul or Chase covered with Brass, and then bound
about with Twine, and outwardly lined over with Leather for Lightness. It has
been found that Iron Guns, made of pure English Cast Iron, have proved as good
as any Brass: Therefore even for some of the First Rate Ships, by consent of
His Majesty, and furtherance of the Right Honorable Sir Thomas Chicheley,
Master of the Ordnance (for the encouragement of the Manufacture) the whole
Complement are Iron turned, and handsomely finished.


CHAP. III.
Of Powder.
THe Efficient Cause for Expelling the Shot, is the Fire that is made of a
Powder compounded of Saltpetre, Brimstone, and Charcoal.

The Saltpetre makes the Blow or Crack, the Sulphur takes fire, and the Coal
rarifies the other two, to make them fire the better.

Two sorts of Gunpowder are commonly in use; One is made of five, one, and
one, being compounded of five parts of Saltpetre, one of Sulphur and the other
Coal,

The other sort, being stronger, is of six, one, and one, being made of six
parts of Saltpeter, one of Brimstone, and the other of Coal.

For Artillery, that of five, one, and one, is generally used, and the other
for Muskets and small Arms, although some use this for Artillery, especially
for Field-peeces. The worst that is made for his Majesty's use in England is of
the latter, six, one, and one. It would be a very advantageous Experiment, that
from a Barrel of Powder one could separate the Petre, and know what weight was
of it exactly.


Anciently they made Powder of four, one, and one, viz. four parts of
Saltpeter, one of Brimstone, and one of Coal, which served for the Artillery
of those times, being smaller than our modern; but this Powder being overweak,
is not now in use.

To compare together the strength of these three severally, the Gunners have
commonly a regard to the quantity of Saltpeter which is found in each; from
whence they say that these will make the same effect. 45l of Powder of four,
one, and one; 42l of five, one, and one; and 40l of six, one, and one, finding
in all these weights an equal quantity of Saltpeter, viz. 30l: and being to
load an ancient Piece, it would be convenient, for example, to take 24l of
Powder of four, one, and one, in lieu whereof they will employ 22l of that of
five, one, and one, or else 21l of that of six, one, and one.

Others in lieu of that of four, one, and one, make use of of that of five,
one, and one; and in stead of that of five, one, and one, employ ^/4 of that of
six, one, and one. So in room of 30l of four, one, and one, they use 24l of
five, one, and one; in lieu of 30l of five, one, and one, they make use of 22l
of that of six, one, and one.

And although this manner is disallowed by some, (notwithstanding it is not to
be contemned) because an equal quantity of Saltpeter mixed with a different
quantity of other materials does not equally operate, but is more efficacious
being united with a less proportion of the others (even to certain proportions)
than with (...) greater, because they overcharge the virtue o^ the Saltpeter
with their too great quantity o^ the other. Whence 42l of Powder of five, one
and one, are stronger than 45l of four, one, and one; and 40l of six, one, and
one, works (...) greater effect than 42l of five, one, and one, although all
contain 30l of Saltpeter.

So I have seen and tried by experience that (...) of Powder of six, one, and
one, does greater effect than the whole of that of five, one, and one, viz. 20l
more of that than 30l of the other.

How much Powder must be allowed to each Piece of Ordnance shall be spoken of
in its proper place.

CHAP. IV.
Of Shot, and its Vent.
TO Field-peeces of the first and second kind they give Shots of Iron, but to
those of the third, Stone-shot, and other Artificial Bodies not heavier than
the said Ball; and to Fieldpieces of the least nature Shots of Lead.

Amongst Balls of the said Diameter, but the three Natures abovesaid, is
commonly assigned this proportion.

Iron weighs the triple more than Stone, as 3 to 1.

Lead weighs one half more than Iron, 3 to 2^

Lead to Stone is 4 times more, as 9 to 2^

But to speak more properly:

Iron is to Stone, as 31 is to 10.

Lead to Iron, as 14 to 10.

Lead to Stone, as 47 to 10.

Nevertheless not all Leads, Iron, or Stone, are of the same weight.

To load Artillery with Shot, as well Iron, Lead, as Stone, they do not fill
the Chase, but leave space for vent; for the Piece not being perfectly round,
the Shot may go in and out easily. But there may not be too much vent, lest the
Fire pass, and the Blow may come too weak.

Therefore the Diameter of a Ball being given, to have the Calibre or Diameter
of the Mouth, you must add its Vent; or the Calibre being given, to find the
Diameter of the Ball, you must subtract the Vent.

In some the Vent is found, by adding to every 10 Pound of shot, one pound, as
30 making 33, and taking the Diameter of the Ball from 33, by the
Caliper-Compasses gives 30 l.

Others take for every 12l, 1l, viz. one Ounce in the Pound All Italy over, 12
Ounces makes a Pound.
, and makes the same thing.

But the usual Rule is to make the Vent always the one and twentieth part of
the Diameter of the Ball, or 1/22 of the Diameter of the Mouth or Muzzle.

Some are of opinion, that to make a Gun bear a certain Load of Ball, one make
it just its Calibre, according to the Diameter of the Ball of which it weighs,
but then they work with a lesser Ball: yet if one would make a Culvering from
30l, they take the just Diameter of 30l, then in action they use a Ball with
the Vent, which will be less than 30l, but it seems more reasonable to make the
Calibre greater to use the Ball of its true Weight.

The Diameter of the Shots of Iron, Stone, and Lead of all used Weights, is by
Gunners described upon a Ruler of Brass, of four Faces, called by them the
Calibre, viz. upon the three Faces the Diameters of Shots of Iron, Lead, and
Stone; and upon the fourth Face, the Foot divided into Inches, etc. according
to the Country.

We put here the said Scale corrected and adjusted to the Venetian Measure,
unto 150l, as represented in the second Figure.

Note, that the said Scale, not holding longer Diameters than of 150l, one may
yet work by greater Weights unto 1200.

The Weight being given, to find the Diameter of the Ball, divide the Number of
Pounds propounded, by Eight, then the Quotient of this Division being searched
upon the Face of the Scale, will give you the Semidiameter, by redoubling of
which you shall have the whole Diameter of the Shot required.

For Example, if 280 Pounds be given, divide this Number by Eight, the Quotient
is 35, then the Diameter of 35 being taken upon the Scale, and redoubled, will
give the Diameter desired of 20l.

The Diameter of a greater Shot being given contained in the Scale, to find the
Weight in Pounds, divide the said Diameter in half, and applying it to the
Scale, observing the Number to which it corresponds, which being multiplied by
Eight, will give the Number of Pounds of the Ball required. Spherical Bodies,
of what Metal soever, are one to another in weight, as the Cubes of their
Diameters; therefore if the Diameter and Weight of any known Spherical Body be
given, and the Diameter of any other like Body be given, and the Weight sought;
or the Weight given, and the Diameter be sought: say, As the Cube of the
Diameter given, is to the Weight given; So is the Cube of the Diameter of the
unweighed Sphere, to its Weight: and contrariwise for the Diameter. By this
Rule, having the Diameter and Weight of a Shot, one may find the Weight of
another; or having the Weight and Diameter of a Shot, and the Weight of
another, one may find the Diameter. My Father, the 14th of March 1671, weighing
several Iron Bullets with a Curious Scale, found one very near round of 6
Inches and 63/100 parts, to weigh exactly 41 Pounds, which agrees exceeding
near to 9 Pound for 4 Inches; and from the before said Rule, a Bullet of 1 pound
Weight will have for its Diameter 1 Inch, and 93/100 of an Inch. The Diameter
of one pound of course Lead will be 1 Inch, and 69/100 parts, and of hard Stone
2 Inches, and 67/100 parts. For making the Ru ler for Calibres, the Author
wants a Table of Solids; I here insert one, made long since by my Father, more
exactly than those printed in Ars magna Artillerii, or Furnier, which solloweth.

The Use whereof is this. By a Scale of Inches, or from any Scale lesser or
greater, which may represent Inches, and every 100 part of an Inch, as that
(Fig. 2.) take out for Example 1 92/100 for Iron, 1 69/100 for Lead, and 2
67/100 for Stone, and prick them from the beginning of the Ruler A, upon the
several Scales of Lead, Iron, and Stone, to the figure 1, which signifies one
Pound: then you must make three equal Diagonal Scales for every one of those
Divisions A. 1. divided into 100 or 1000, as in the Fig. 3, one is done for
Iron divided into 5000 parts. Now if you desire for Example to divide the Scale
for each pound for Iron cast Shot, by the Diagonal Scale, and the Table of
Solids, take the Numbers in the Table answering to the several Pounds or Parts,
and from your Diagonal Scale (Fig. 3.) take those parts, and prick them from A
the beginning of the Scale to the place that shall signify the Pounds
answerable. Suppose it be for 6l, I take 1. 81 from the Scale with the
Compasses, and set it from A to b 6, and 2. 15 for 10l to c, and so from one
Division to another 'till the Ruler be Complete. The same work is to be
observed for the Lines for Lead and Stone from their several Diagonal Scales;
you may note that 100 from those Scales is for 1l, 200 for 8l, 300 for 27l, 400
for 64l, and 500 for 125l, because 1. 8. 27. 64. and 125 are the Cubes of 1. 2.
3. 4. 5. Note also, that the Table shows you the Tenths of a Pound to 3l, the
Quarters to 6l, and the half to 20l, for the more exactness in the Divisions.
For the use of the Calibre Ruler, if the Diameter of the Bullet be known in
Inches, just over against those Inches and Parts is the Weight set in the Line,
answering to the respective Metal; or contrary if the Weight be given, then the
Diameter answers in the line of Inches. As for Example, against the Diameter of
4 Inches answers 9l of Iron, or contrary against 9l of Iron 4 Inches Diameter
of the Bullet. But mine Author made his Scale to the Semidiameter of Bullets,
which makes him take the Cube of 2, viz. 8, and to double as you see in the
uses of his Scale, which is far more troublesome than this way I have set down.

I have added another Line to the former three, called the Line for Powder, it
gives the Weight of Powder that will fill up a Cylinder, whose Length and
Diameter are equal; it is made as the former Lines were, from this position
(which is found by Experience) that one pound of Powder will fill a Bore or
Cylinder of 3 Inches and 165/1000 parts of an Inch in Diameter and Length, and
the uses are considerable for making Cartridges, or to know how much of the
Cylinder of a Gun will be filled with a certain weight of Powder. As for
Example, A Cylinder of 4 Inches and in Diameter and Length, will take 2 l of
Powder to fill, as you may find over against 4 Inches, and over against 6
pounds of Powder you have 5 Inches almost, for the Diameter and Length of any
Bore, which I take to be very useful.

CHAP. V.
Of the Measure of Artillery or Guns.
THE ordinary Measure to form and proportion all the parts of any Piece of
Ordnance, and also its Carriage, is by the Diameter of the Mouth of the same
Piece.

But to make the Ladle, Rammer, Sponge, and other Instruments as enters into
its Chase, they work by the Diameter, not of the Mouth, but of the Ball of the
same Piece. Therefore they use in some places the Foot divided into 12 Inches,
and each Inch into 12 Points or Grains. We shall value them by Diameters, Bocca
or Bore.
following the more ordinary way; but one may reduce all Diameters to Feet,
Inches, and parts of an Inch, so it may be free for every one to make use of
such Measure as shall please him best.

CHAP. VI.
Of the several Natures of Artillery.
ALL Artillery are commonly reduced into three sorts. The first is that of the
Culvering, the second Cannons of Battery, the third Cannons Petrieri.

The reason of this Distinction ought to be taken from the end to which the
Artillery serves.

The intent of Artillery in general is to offend a far off; but sometimes is
principally understood the distance of Place, sometimes the Offense, although
one never goes without the other: for being to shoot a far off, the Object must
either be of a strong or weak resistance; but if you would offend not far off,
the Object in like manner must be either of a weak or a strong resistance. Now
there being four ends, it seems reasonable that Artillery be reduced to four
sorts, according to the Intents for which they serve.

To offend a far off, in case of strong resistance, the Culverings do serve,
which carries a Ball of Iron from 14 to 30l weight, although some make them to
120l.

To offend a far off, in case of weak resistance, as in Troops, Squadrons, etc.
those Pieces do serve which are called Field-peeces, or the small Artillery,
and not Royal, and carry an Iron shot from 1 pound to 10 or 12 pound.

To offend not far distant, in case of a strong resistance, are your Cannon of
Battery, which carry a Ball of Iron from 20 to 50l weight, although some are
made which carry to 100l and more, and serve to break down Walls and Parapets.

Lastly, to offend at a small distance, an object of weak resistance, as Ships,
and other Machines of Timber, they do use your Cannon called Petrieroes,
because they carry a Shot of Stone, or any other Artificial Substance, and
never of Iron; and this Ball of Stone may weigh from 14l to 100l weight.

Note, that these are the four principal intents of each of these Natures, but
a Piece of one sort may serve in point of necessity for several Services.

We nevertheless will not discourse of the common use, but will name three only
sorts of Artillery, reducing the first to Culvering, and Field-peeces, which
come to one another in a near proportion.

To the second they of Battery.

To the third Cannon Petrieroes, and to which we will also add the Mortars and
Tribucchi's, which offend by a curved Line, and moreover an Appendix of Petars,
although improperly they are reduced amongst Artillery not offending at a
distance. We distinguish all our great Guns in England into two only sorts,
viz. Field-peeces from the least to twelve Pounders, and Cannon of Battery,
from Culvering to whole Cannon.


END OF THE FIRST PART.
To divert the Reader a little at the end of each Part, I shall give some short
Discourses of the stupendeous Bridge made by that most famous Warrior
Alexander Prince of Parma, in the Year 1585, over the Schelde near Antwerp, and
of the prodigious Effect of Powder, fitted into Vessels for breaking the same.
First out of Furnier Hydro. lib. 2. in French.
THE Prince of Parma commanding in chief the King of Spains Armies in the Low
Countries, and knowing of what great concern the Recovery or the Retaking of
the City of Antwerp would be to his Masters Affairs, laid Siege before it in
the Month of August, in the year 1584, and having seized on several Forts and
other important places about the City, resolved to make and lay a Bridge over
the Schelde, at two Leagues from the City, to hinder the Besieged from Succors
which might come from Zealand that way, that being the only place by which
they could receive them. And being Master of the Shore as well on that side of
Flanders as Brabant, he raised two strong Bulworks on both sides, and then
struck Piles of 30, 35, 40, and 50 Foot long, and mortass'd them together with
strong Beams and Girders to uphold a wooden Bridge, which he called the
Pallisade, and upon which ten men might march in front. The River was large in
this place, 1500 paces, and so deep that it was impossible to find Trees long
and strong enough to reach the bottom; and not being able to carry on his work
more then 1000 Feet into the water, he finished the rest, which was 1300 Feet,
by 30 Ships, which were distant 30 Feet the one from the other: each Ship had
two Ankers a head, and a Stern to hinder the impetuosity of the Tides, and many
Shipmasts and Planks to make the Platform of the Bridge; the Vessels were
fastened together with four Chains and four Cables, and carried two Guns a
head, and two a Stern, and thirty Soldiers: upon this Bridge one might pass
from Brabant into Flanders.

On the Bridge, at every 500 paces, there were Rafts made of Shipmasts and
other wood, to stop those that came, and to give leisure to those of the Bridge
to fire from above and sink them. Moreover there were many small Vessels loaded
with Soldiers, who guarded the Avenues.

At the time that they built the Bridge, the Bastions on both sides the River
were well guarded with Infantry, and furnished with Cannon, which nevertheless
could not hinder that in the space of seven months which they employed in
making the Pallisade, but that many Vessels went and came to Antwerp, where
they also fortified themselves, and prepared several Inventions to break this
Bridge.

Frederick Junibell or Giambel, Native of Mantoua, an Excellent Ingeneer, who
was sent there by the Queen of England, having demanded of the Citizens three
Vessels, one of 150 Tuns, another of 350, and a third of 500 Tuns, and 60
others wide and flat, which he would have joined together with Chains, and have
them disposed in form of a half Moon, to have them rise with the Tide, well
armed with Grapnals, but he could obtain but two of 70 or 100 Tuns, of which
one was called the Fortune, the other the Hope, with ten other small flat
Boats.

Then seeing these two Vessels well timber'd, and of a just capacity, he made
in each, with great square pieces of white stone, a Coffer or Chest of five
Foot thick, 40 Foot long, and three and a half large and deep; in one of which
he put 10000l of Cannon Powder, and in the other 7500, and covered both of them
with massive great broad Grave-stones, which might easily resist the violence
of the Enemies Cannon.

There were laid cross these Machins several Matches dressed with Sulphur, and
aboard each Vessel there was an artificial Engine, which ought to burn a whole
hour before that the Coffers took fire, to amuse the Besiegers, and to make
them believe that there was no other thing then what appeared alost.

Besides, there were 32 very flat bottomed Shallops, full of Ingredients, of
which eight at every half hour ought to descend with the Tide, besides others
full of wild fire, which were to burn leisurely the Rafts before the Bridge, to
the end that the Enemy being weary by continual firing, for the space of some
hours, the great Vessels might have an easier access.

The fourth day of July being appointed for this Enterprise, all this
Preparation had not such success as they promised themselves, therefore they
suspected some Treason; for these four Squadrons of eight Shallops apiece, set
sail almost all in the same time, contrary to the design of the Ingeneer, the
tide beginning to slack, and the two great Vessels going away sooner than they
should have done, one ran ashore, and wanting water, did no Execution then kill
some Soldiers. The Prince of Parma believing that the rest would work no other
effect, and that all would vanish in smoke, retired into St. Mary's Fort. But a
little after, three Shallops having burned some Rafts; and the great Vessel as
it happened (several of the Besiegers being come to view the Shallops) arriving
just upon the point of the Pallisade, fired with such violence and fury, that
it tore in a thousand pieces six of the Ships of the Bridge, overset and blew
into the air several others, tumbled down the Prince of Parma, and the Marquess
of Pescara, (who were returning with as many men as they could find within a
league about,) made an Earthquake four miles round, and broke the the Glass
windows at six leagues distance, killed more than 500 persons, amongst whom
were the Marquess of Rubais, and the Lord of Billy; moreover, emptied the very
channel of the River, that being dry, and the water raised in the Air, and
falling in the neighboring fields, almost entirely filled with water an
adjacent Fort, and the Soldiers in the field were up to the knees in water, had
their Cloths, Matches, Muskets, and Artillery all wet, and were rendered so
unfit for service, that they had been without question routed, if the
Antwerpians had been in readiness to have made a brisk Sally. The Prince
forthwith repaired this damage, and left an open place in the Bridge to let
all such like Vessels pass, if they should make any more attempt. Once more
those of Antwerp sent another Ship of vast greatness, with hopes to perform
more advantageous effects, and called her the End of the War, but succeeding
very ill, as some others which were sent down in the same time against the
Bridge the 22 of the same month, at last they were forced to render themselves
the 17. August, 1583. This relation was drawn out of the Annals of Bertius, and
of P. Orlandin of the Campaigne of Jesus.

THE SECOND PART: Of the Bore or Chase of Guns.
CHAP. I.
Of the general Proportion of the Bores of Guns.
A Great Gun or Cannon, is a long Barrel, round and hollow in the middle.
Before they are cast, they are drawn out in Design, with their Proportions.

The Proportions, are either general or particular.

The General Proportions, are those which serve in all sorts of Ordnance, and
those are, as touching their Breech, Touchhole, Alteration of the thickness,
Trunnions, the Cascabel, and Rings.

The Particular Proportions, are those which change according to the Nature and
Species of the Artillery, as the Calibre, length, and thickness.

As to the General Proportions, the Breech is always thick, when the Metal at
the Touchhole is thick, comprehending also the Metal of the Chamber if there
be any.



The Touchhole is used at the end of the Chase.

The Line of Alteration of Metals, is made at the middle of the Length, betwixt
the Touchhole and the Muzzle in cast Ordnance.

The Trunnions are thick and long, one Diameter of the Chase or Concave (where
they are made.) In Gross Cannons very often they make them shorter, not finding
Side-Timbers or Cheeks strong enough to make the Carriages.

The Axletree of the Trunnions is distant from the Muzzle 4/7 of the length of
the Chase, and from the Touchhole 3/7, to the intent that the Piece may be
moved easily, and being something heavier behind than before, is not Muzzle
heavy. Some by putting them far distant from the Muzzle, and from the
Touchhole, by which they are made too heavy at the Muzzle.

They are placed before the Level of the Metal under the Chase, that the Piece
may be the higher mounted upon his Carriage, and may receive more degrees of
Elevation. Some oftentimes place them not so low, but make them so, that their
highest leine corresponds and passes by the Diameter of the Chase, and the
Diameter of the Trunnions, by the lowest line of Cylinder, as do demonstrate
the Fig. 3. and 4. Fig III. and IV.


Cascabel or Pummel serves to elevate and to direct the Cannon, and is lesser
but longer than the Trunnions.

The Maniglions or Dolphins, are two great Cornishes at the Extremities, which
rise higher than the Inequalities of the Rings which are upon the back of the
Piece, and do not hinder the sight, and also serve for Ornament and Strength.
The Muzzle-ring is high 2/8, and the Base-ring is high part of the Calibre
about, but the Rings in Petrieroes at the Mouth are, and at the Breech 1/12,
and are large at pleasure.

Of the Particular proportions, we shall speak of them underneath, according to
all the natures of Ordnance.

CHAP. II.
Of the Culvering.
CVlverings are Distinguished into three manners; first, according to the
Calibre or nature of the Ball; secondly, as to thickness of the Metal;
thirdly, according to the length of the Bore.

As to the Calibre, they are called whole Culvering, Culvering, and
Demi-Culvering.

The whole Culvering are called anciently Dragon-Drakes, and carry a Ball of
Iron from 40, 50, to 60l etc.

The Culvering from 35l, 30, 25, 20.

The Half Culvering from 18, 16, and 14.

As to the thickness of Metal, some are called small, some common, other
reinforced or fortified.

The Small, used in old time, have their Metal thick

At the Touchhole In the Middle 6/8 of their Calibre. At the Neck 4/8

The Common Modern have their Metal thick

At the Touchhole 1 Middle of their Calibre. At the Neck 4/8

The Modern Fortified

At the Touchhole 1 Middle of their Calibre. Neck

The Culvering does not grow equally small from the Touchhole to the Neck, but
fall off at several Rings for better Fortification.

Some make the Demi-Culvering better fortified than the Culvering, as one may
observe in Field-peeces, but it is not generally used.

As to the Length, they distinguish the Culvering into ordinary, extraordinary,
and bastard.

The Ordinary Culvering, are long from the Touchhole to the Muzzle 32 Calibres.

The Extraordinary are longer than the Ordinary, viz. to 39, 40, 41 Calibres.

The Bastard are shorter than the Ordinary, viz. only 28, 27, and 26.

Although the true measure of the Ordinary be 32 Calibres, notwithstanding they
are sometimes made of 30 and 33 Calibres, and are called Ordinary.

The Whole Culvering are made one Diameter or two less, and the Demi-Culvering
one longer than the Culvering.

Of the several natures of Culvering, one may form nine species of each. As
Culvering ordinary small, and Bastard ordinary small, extradinary small,
Ordinary Cannon, Extraordinary Cannon, Bastard Cannon, Reinforced Ordinary,
Reinforced Extraordinary, and Bastard Reinforced.

One may say the self same thing of the Fig. V.
Whole and Half Culvering.

CHAP. III.
Of Field Pieces.
FIeld Pieces are generally reduced into the same Natures as Culvering, and are
also distinguished into three manners: 1. as to the Calibre, 2. as to the
richness of the Metal, and 3. to the Length.

As to the Calibre, they have these principal natures following.

The Smeriglio or Rabinet carries a Ball of Iron from l to a Pound.

The Falconet from 2, 3, to 4l.

The Falcon or half Saker, from 5, 6, to 7l.

The Saker or Culvering from 8, 10, to 12l.

Others with the same Calibre as these, will carry as before.

As to the Richness of the Metal, they have the same distinctions that the
lesser Culverings have, Common and Reinforced, although these Field-peeces are
generally used Fortified, and the lesser they are the more Fortified, to resist
better the Force of the Powder in their frequent Discharges.

The Thickness of Metal at the Touchhole, Neck, etc. are the same as the
Culvering.

As to the Length, they are distinguished into Ordinary, Extraordinary, and
Common.

The Ordinary ought to follow the same Rule as the Culverings of 32 Calibre,
oftentimes they are made longer, viz. from 32 to 34. The Saker, Rabinet, and
Falconet, from 38, to 40, and 42, because the smalness of their Bore, if made
32, they would not advance beyond the Circumference of their Wheels, and
therefore would do no effect.

The Extraordinary, are those that pass the said measure, and amongst those is
remarkable the Passavolante or Zabratana, long from 48 to 50 Calibres, and most
rich in Metal, and which carries a Ball from 5 to 6 pound, as the Falcon, but
now are seldom cast.

The Bastard, are those who do not arrive to 32 Calibres; amongst which are
found the Moyenne or Minion, which is a Modern Piece Fortified, and carries a
Ball of 8 or 10l shot (as the Saker,) but is long only 26 Diameters, used in
the Galleys, being so short for the smalness of the place.

The Aspide is an ancient Piece, and poor in Metal, and although it carries 8
or 10 pound shot, is no longer than 22 or 20 Calibres.

The Musket di Givoco, is a small Piece used only by the Venetian Gunners,
carrying one Pound Ball of Iron as the Smeriglio, long 28 Diameters or 30,
thick at the Touchhole Diameters 1 1/16, at the Neck.

The Saltamartino, is a small Piece used by the said Venetians, long 15
Diameters, carries shot 4l of Iron as the Falconet, thick at the Touchhole one
Calibre, at the Neck. Diameter. It is called the Saltamartino, from being
turned about upon all occasions, and being loaded behind at the Tale of the
Carriage, without drawing back the Piece, and there be many of them in the said
State.

The Ribadocchino.
Rabbonett, was a Piece of Artillery anciently used, and carried a Pound shot
or 1 of Iron as the Smeriglio, but this Rabbonett is used in Flanders, and
carries as abovesaid, and long Ordinary 36 Diameters.

There be other particular Names for Field. Fig. V.
Pieces, but these be the most usual.

CHAP. IV.
Of Cannons of Battery.
THE Cannons of Battery, are Pieces ordinarily shorter than Culverings, and are
distinguished, first, as to their Calibre; secondly as to the Richness of their
Metal; and thirdly, as to their Length.

The Calibres are as follows.

The Cannon carries a Ball of Iron from 16 to 18 pounds.

The Demi-Cannon from 20 to 28l.

The Cannon from 30, 40, 45, to 50l, and formerly even to 60 pound.

The whole Cannon from 70 to 120.

The Cannon Basilisk from 130 to 150 and 200 pound Ball, used by the Turks.

As to the Richness of their Metal, some are Ancient and Small, others Modern
and Common, and Modern Fortified.

The Ancient are small, Tapered or Bell-bored.

The Chambred have their Metal thick at the Touchhole 6/8, in the middle, and
at the Neck of their Calibre.

The Tapered are thick as the Chambred, but are more Tapered toward the
Touchhole, long Diameters 4, large in the beginning Diameters 1, and in the
bottom Diameters, in the middle, at the Touchhole of the mouth.

The Common are either Chambred, or Tapered.

The Chambred have this thickness of Metal at the Touchhole, in the Middle, in
the Neck.

The Incamerated have the same thickness as the former, and moreover the
Chamber near the Breech long 4 Diameters of the Piece about, large as much in
the beginning as in the end, and with the risalto.
Gengiva or degrees one over another, thick of the Calibre.

The Modern Enforced are all Chambred, and have such thickness at the
Touchhole one Diameter, at the Middle 5 or 6/8, at the Neck.

Note, first, that some are called Enforced, although Common Incamerated.

Secondly, observe that the quarter, and Modern half Cannon, have the
Reinforcement (...) Fortification of a Culvering, the better to ser^ in its
place.

Thirdly, that the Cannon Basilisk has greater Reinforcement, as we shall
hereafter declare.

As to the Length, they are Ordinary, Extraordinary, or Bastard.

The length of the Ordinary is 18 Diameter.

Although very often they make the Them Cannon 22 and 24 Diameters.

The quarter-Cannon is made long 26 Diameters, or 28, to the end being so long,
and Fortified or Reinforced, they may serve in pla^ of Culvering or
Demi-Culvering.

The length of these Extraordinary Pieces (...) greater than the Ordinary
respectively, and amongst the rest is famous the Cannon Basilis^ used by the
Turks in nature of a whole Cannon, which is long from 24 to 30 diameters thick
at the Touchhole diameters 1, at the Middle diameter 1, at the Neck diameter,
and carries, as we have said, a Ball from 130 to 150 and 200l weight.

The Bastard Cannon are those which are shorter than the Ordinary; if they are
Cannons or Whole Cannons, their Calibre is 24, or 22 if they are Demi-Cannons;
28 or 26 if they be Quatter-Cannons.

They are called Rebussi, Crepanti, Verrati, long Diameters 15; and the
Saltamarino may be reduced to this nature as to the length, but by ^s placed
amongst the Field Pieces, by reason of the smalness of its Calibre. Some call
those Bastard Cannon, which have a greater length than the Ordinary Cannon,
which do not arrive to the ordinary length of Culvering; but these ought rather
to be called either Extraordinary Cannon or Bastard Culvering. Fig. VI.


CHAP. V.
Of Cannon Petrieroes.
THE Petrieroes, are so called from its Ball of (Pietra) stone, with which they
are loaded from 2 to 100 and 150l, for the most and all are Incamerated, or
Chambred and continued in one Piece; or else with the Chamber separated with a
Braga of Iron, and therefore are called from that Petrieroes a Braga.
Braga.

Those that are continued, and of one Piece, are either Ancient, or Modern.

They are long from 8, 8 to 9 Diameter, Calibre, Bocca, Bore, Mouth, all one,
and B signifies them all.
diameters, although some are to 10 and 12.

The Ancient have this thickness of Metal, the Chamber being not computed, at
the Touchhole, at the Middle, at the Neck of the Calibre.

The Chamber has the Gengiva or rising of the Calibre, the largness is, the
length is D. 1 of the Calibre, or else diameters 4 of the same Chamber. The
Modern have the thickness of the Metal rising at the Chamber; at the
Touchhole, Middle, and at the Neck.

The Gengiva, or rising of the Chamber, is thick diameters.

The mouth of the same is of the Calibre.

The Length is Calib. 2, viz. Dia. 4 and 6 of the Chamber.

But it is to be observed, that some make them Incamerated, that the Mouth of
the Chamber be of the Calibre, and three times as long as large.

Some make the Chamber so, that it may be the of the weight of the Ball; as if
the Piece carry 30l, they make the Mouth of the Chamber large, as much as is
the Diameter of the Ball of Stone of 6l; they make the said Chamber long
diameters 2 and of the said Chamber, and make these Pieces long from 12 to 14
diameters of the same Chamber; and the thickness of the Metal of these two with
the Chamber, is at the Touchhole diameter 1, at the Middle diameter, at the
Neck of the Mouth of the Chamber.

Note, that some make Petrieroes not Incamerated, long Calibres 12, and thick
at the Touchhole, at the Middle, at the Neck of Fig. VII.
the Calibre.

The Petrieroes a Braga, have their Chamber separated, which is called the
Mascolo, Servitore, and Covetta, and so they are loaded behind; they are
serviceable upon Galleys, Vessels, Towers, and other narrow places, where the
Piece cannot reverse; they are either of beaten Iron or Brass, as also the
Servitory or Mascoli; the Braga is of Iron.

They carry a Ball of Stone from 2 to 14l, and no more.

They have their Chase long from 10 to 12 Calibres; the thickness behind is
Calib., at the Neck, or else behind Calibre, at the Neck.

The Trunnions are thick and long Calib. round about, distant from the Mouth,
and from the end, about the length of the Bore.

Betwixt the Trunnions and the end in the middle, are placed two Wings, to
fasten the Braga, and hang without of the Calibre, and are fixed to the very
Axletree of the Chase.

For every Petriero de Braga, there should be three Mascole, which are large at
the Mouth, and also of the Bore, long in the Chase 4, 5, or also 6 diameters.
The Metal about is thick one diameter, and particularly about or as much as the
Piece to the Bottom, they have an Handle, and at the Head are made small, to
drive a little into the Bore well closed, viz. diameter round about its Moscola.

The Braga is of Iron, ordinarily fastener straight to the Wings; it is
prolonged within that it may be capable of the length of the Moscolo, and its
Coin behind, which makes i^ firm; and in the end has a long trail or trai^
Calib. 3 or 2 with its Button, or Pummel, and serves to manage the Petriero:
cross the Brag^ underneath, is a place to sustain the Mascolo.

The Wedge is of Iron, thick or del: Calib. large at the least one Calibre, and
long about. One also may have more Wedges to keep the Mascolo or Chamber joined
to the Bore.

CHAP. VI.
Of Mortars or Trabucchi.
THey are short Pieces, of the nature of Petrieroes; and with these they shoot
Balls of Stone, Granado-Shels, and Cases full of small Shot, not by a Right
line, but by a Crook from on high, so they fall where it should be appointed.

The Chase from the Touchhole to the Muzzle in all, is Calib. 2 and. The
Chamber is long Calib., large Calib.. The remainder is Calib. 1, the Gengiva or
Rise of the Chamber is thick Calib.. They are thick besides the Chamber at the
Touchhole, in the middle, at the neck of the Calibre.

There is no other difference betwixt a Mortar Piece and a Trabuccho, but in
the placing of Trunnions, since the Mortar-peece has the diameter of the
Trunnions, which corresponds to the end of the Chamber. And the Trabuccho has
its Trunnions placed in the thickness of its Breech.

The Mortars or Trabucchi, that have their Bore long Diam. 3, are best to shoot
Balls of Stone, Fireballs, Base and Bur-shot, because they require a greater
force; but to shoot Grenades they do greater effects, being long diam. 2, or a
little more, by reason of the Spoletta or length of their Bore.

They are most used to shoot Grenades betwixt Fig. X.
50 and 100l, although sometimes one fits them to 300l weight.

END OF THE SECOND PART.
Concerning the Bridge, and Blow near Antwerp, out of Pietro Paulo Floriani
Diffesa and Offesa delle Piazza. page 141.
BUT it did not so happen with Alexander Prince of Parma, at the Bridge made at
the Siege of Antwerp, the like to which was never yet seen or related in any
History, being attacqued from a Machine of Fire, the most Horrible and dreadful
that ever was put in practice in any part of the known World. An Engine without
doubt invented by the proper Enemy of Mankind, and brought to perfection by his
new Infernal Ministers. It was eight months in making by the Ingeneer of
Antwerp, and in it were the only hopes to relieve the City. It was a great Ship
strongly timbred, in which was a strong Valut or Arch made of Stone and Mortar,
filled with 200 Barrels of Powder, and above the Valut were great Stones of all
forms, Cannon shot, Chains of Iron, enough to ruin a whole City. And within
these vessels was laid a secret Fire or Fusee so cunninly, that it should not
fire the Powder, 'till it was arrived at the Bridge, or a little after, etc.

THE THIRD PART. Of Carriages for Artillery.
CHAP. I.
Of Carriages for Culvering.
THE Carriages are made of two Cheeks, four Transomes, or cross beams of wood,
with two Wheels, the Axle-tree, and their Iron work.

The Sides or Cheeks of the Carriage are once and a half as long as the Chase,
which being 32 Calibres long, the Carriage will have in length 48 Calibres.
Fig. XI.


Some make only the Carriage long one and of the Chase or Cylinder, some one
and, but the first manner is most approved for the following reasons.

As to the length of the Carriage, the longest suffers less in the splitting of
the Piece, does recoyl enough, but is more subject to break in the midst, yet
more spares the Wheels, is more easy to turn about, and manage the Piece, and
in short will last longer. But the short Carriage makes a longer Shot, does not
recoyl so much, and is easy to break it self in the Breech, is good for small
Platforms, and upon which one gives more Elevation to the Piece. Fig. XII.


The thickness of the Cheeks or Sides of the Carriages is ordinarily one
Diameter of the Muzzle.

The largeness of the Head, to the very end of the Length, is equally from B 2
to B 3.

The bending in of the middle from B 3 to B 3.

The Tail from B 1 to B 2.

The end of the Breech B 3 about; if at any time it turns or oversets, which
happens when the Carriage is forward on the Wheel.

The Trunnion-holes are cut in the uppermost side, distant from the upper part
B 3 complete, and deep B.

The holes for the Axletree are cut in the lowermost part large B 1 square,
distant from the Front B 4 complete, or at the least B 3 about, and distant
from the uppermost Side B 2 complete. Some therefore do not make the Hole for
the Axletree altogether square, but do make it blunt on the two inferior
Angles, Fig. XIII. XIV.
as shows the Fig. 13 and 14.

Some do not make a through hole for the Axletree, but only a Joint made hollow
into the lowermost part, when the Cheeks are not very large, and into the Joint
they place either all the thickness of the Axletree equally, or only binding it
with a band of Iron, which passes Fig. XV. XVI.
about, as in the Fig. 15, 16.

The two Cheeks or Sides of the Carriage, are fastened from the four Transomes
or cross Beams of Wood, which besides the general qualities of binding together
the Cheeks, have also some particular.

First, that toward the Mouth of Front hinders Fig. XVII.
that the Piece does not split. Secondly, that of the Breech serves to hold up
the Breech of the Culvering, and upon which it rests. The third, that of the
Manovelle, or little Pieces, serves to rest upon, in elevating the body of the
Piece. The fourth, that of the Train or Tail serves to place into the hole the
Bolt or Fastning-pin of the Fore-Carriage of the Piece.

All the Transomes are thick B 1, and large B 1 (from that of the Tail except
when it is large B 2) all equally long, viz. as much as the Diameter of the
Piece is near the Trunnions; and moreover B 1, because the middle Transome is
joined into the Sides, and so their Sides are parallel.

Some make the abovesaid Transomes equal in length, viz. that of the Breech as
long as the diameter of the Breech, and moreover one diameter for the Mortess,
and the other for the Manovelle or flat Transome a little greater, but that of
the Tail longest, and the Fore-Transome shortest of all; and the Sides or
Cheeks are not parallel, but follow the unequal thickness of the Piece.

When the Sides of the Carriage are parallel and narrow as above, they ought to
be somewhat taken down betwixt the Trunnions and the Transome of the Breech, to
the end that the body of the Piece and Cornishes may enter within.

Besides, some take down always the said Sides inwardly betwixt the flat
Transomes and the Tail-Transome, raising of a Diameter to render it more light
and more easy to be managed.

The places of the Fore-locks are as follows.

That of the Forepart is distant from the Front completely B 1, and from the
lower Side B.

That of the Breech goes behind from the Trunnion-holes, as much as the Piece
is long, from the Trunnions to the Breech, to the end that the Breech may lie
just upon it, and is to lie as low as is possible, to give a greater Elevation
to the Piece; it is to be therefore distant from the edge or lower side of the
Carriage B.

That of the (flat Transome) is higher, and distant from the Line of the middle
Plate toward the Trunnion-holes B 1, and under the upper side of the Cheek B.

That of the Tail, is placed in the part turned up, or over the same Tail,
distant from beneath and from above of the side of the Cheek B and from the end
B 1.

The Transomes do not enter with its whole piece into the Cheek, but grows
small above and beneath of its thickness.

The Iron-work necessary for a Carriage, are four Garnishing Bolts, great Bolts
or Pins of Iron, viz. one near every wooden Transome which passes through the
sides of the Carriage, and may have Plate-rings and Fore-locks for to Fig.
XVIII.
keep the Carriage sides firm.

In the Tail Transome there is a hole made, which is armed with Plates of Iron,
in which is placed the Iron Pin of the Fore-Carriage, for as much as it
conducteth the Artillery upon the Carriage.

Against the Trunnion-holes are placed a little Bolster and Capsquare in the
lowermost part, which does shoulder or uphold the Trunnion in the recoyling, to
save the wood of the Fig. XIX.
Cheeks with his Contraforts behind.

Of late, under the Trunnions they put the Counter trunnions or Capsquares,
which is a Plate of Iron, which does incompass the Trunnion-holes, and part of
the upper side; to the end that the thickness of the Piece may not spoil it:
and where they place the Counter-trunnions, there is no need of a Bolster,
although in some Pieces one may use both ways; the Counter-trunnion is showed
by Fig. 20. Fig. XX.


All the forepart is covered with a Plate of Iron, or Binding, under to the
very joynting of the Axletree, and over to the Trunnion-holes fastened with Iron
nayls.

Above the Trunnion-holes pass the Capsquares, or joynted Plates, which stay
the Trunnions in the Trunnion-holes, and the Capsquares are fastened by four
long Capsquare-pins, which pass through to the very bottom of the Cheek, and
under are fastened with its Fore-locks and Linch-pins.

One of these Capsquare-pins passes by the Fig. XXI.
Axletree to the Binding-plate below, where it is fastened with its Forelockeyes.

The Tail is also all bound over and under with its Plates fastened with Nails,
and lastly are placed two great Rings to the sides of the Cheeks, half behind
the Wheels, to fasten Ropes for to manage and conduct the Piece; and there are
nailed two Hooks in the outward side of the Carriage, viz. one on each side
near the forepart, to fasten other Cords to draw the Carriage forward on. Fig.
XXII.


The Axletree of the Culvering is to be as long as to pass through the
Carriage, the forepart of the Wheel with that overplus as is necessary to
contain the fastening or Linchpins at the Nave, which may be 15 Diameters about.

The Thickness, for as much as the exterior largeness of the Carriage is 1 and
B, so moreover on each side of B 1 square, and moreover that eighth part they
leave; to the end that the Wheels in its motion do not touch the sides of the
Carriage.

The remainer is round about the Carriage, thick in Diameter B or B 1, and in
the end thick B 1.

It is made of hard wood, as of Elm, Oak, or such like.

Its Length is thoroughly fortified with its bar of Iron which pasleth through,
of two Inches about, to the end that being strong, if the Axletree should
break, it might alone be able to govern the weight of the Piece; it is let into
the Axletree underneath.

That part which surmounteth the forepart of the Nave of the Wheel shall be B 1
or B, and is defended by its clout of Iron, which is an Iron-plate that
incompasseth the Head of the Axletree, with two Sides for to nail or fasten it
to the Axletree. Fig. XXIII


The Clout of Iron has moreover only open its Nave or forepart, and in that
part which sticks out is made a Hole which passes through, as also in its
Clout, where they put a Pin to hinder the Wheels that they do not slip off.
Fig. XXIV


The same Axletret is fastened in the Sides with a Capsquare-pin, which passes
through it as abovesaid.

The Wheels for the Culvering by some are universally made high B 14 in
Diameter, viz the greatness of the Nave B 4, which is long B 4.

The length of the Spokes B 4 for every one, setting aside that part which is
joynted in, and. B 1 for the bigness of the Fellows.

Some make them in Pieces of 12l to 30l, high in Diameter B 10, but others from
30l upward 9 Diameters.

Those of 10 B in Diameter have a more particular measure.

The Nave is thick B 3, long B 3.

The Spokes, long B 2 completely, but moreover have B 1 or B 1, to mortaise
into the Nave and Fellows.

Those of 9 B in Diameter have all the Measures as is already said, but the
Spokes are only long B 2 completely, besides that part which is mortaised into
the Fellows.

The Nave does handsomely diminish to its extremity, abating from that part
toward the Carriage B, and of the other B 1, or little less in all.

The Spokes are 12 in number, and are fixed in the thickest part of the Nave,
so that they enter B 1 or more; but they are placed not perpendicularly, but
outwardly sloping.

The Fellows are in number six, and make up the Circumference of the Wheel, and
in each of them are fixed two Spokes; the Fellow is thick B 1, and large B 1.

The Iron-work of Wheels are these.

The Fellows are armed about without with Plates of Iron called Dowledges,
thick B 1/11 or 1/12, large B 1; and so long, that they may cover the whole
Circumference of the Wheel Fig. XXV.
Their midpart meets with the Joint of the Spoke, and the Streaks join close
unto the middle of the Spoke. Upon which are nailed Nail with large broad
Heads, and to their Naves, which are something turned over without, also are
bound over the Streaks by a Stirrup narrow within, with its string or Binding
of Iron.

There are moreover high Stirrups, which bind Fig. XXVI
fast the heads of the Spokes, fastened underneath Fig. XXVII.
with their strings of Iron.

The Heads or Barrels of the Wheels are outwardly bound with four Rings of
Iron, two in the thickest part near the Spokes, and two more toward the
Extremity. Furthermore they have the Mouth furnished for the Axletree with a
Bocchole of Iron, according to the use of all Wheels; if they shall be of
Brass, they shall be yet better, and more if they be upheld. Fig. XXVIII.


CHAP. II.
Of Carriages for Field-Peeces.
CArriages for Field pieces are like those for Culverings, and have the same
proportion, except in these following particulars.

The Cheeks are thick B 1, for having only one Diameter they will prove too
small, especially in little Pieces.

The Axletree is not fortified with a Counter Axletree of Iron, being
sufficient to rule the Piece without that; nevertheless sometimes they are
fixed in Sakers.

The Wheels are high in Diameter Boc. 14. and in the Smeriglio and Falconetto
they are without Measures, but that they may not prove less than 4 Foot about
in Diameter, to the end that they may come unto the Parapets and Embrasures.

CHAP. III.
Of Carriages for Canon of Battery.
ALL the Artists do not agree to determine the exact Length of Carriages for
Cannon of Battery. Some would have them once and half longer than the length of
the Chase or Cylinder, as in Culverings; some one time and one third; but the
most commodious way is that they be made one time and a half, o^ B 28.

The thickness of the Cheeks are diverse, according to diverse Opinions. Some
will have them B 1 always, other B, others B, other one B; in Pieces of 30l
less, but in heavier Pieces, viz. from 30l upward they allow them 1^ for 100.
In fine they are less than the Mouth.

The largeness of the said Cheeks are divers^ At the forepart Call. 3. 3. 3: at
the middle Calibre 2, 2, 3.

At the Tail always Call. 2, the End being something turned up upwards, is
Calibre 2, (...) Call. 2.

The Transomes are four, as in the Culverings; the Length is throughout equal,
viz. (...) much as the thickness of the Piece, near (...) Trunnions, and
moreover the thickness of t^ half Cheeks for the Mortessing, to the end t^ said
sides may de parallel. The thickness shall be B 1, but better only. The
largeness of the three first shall be B 1, but that of the Tail shall be of 2
B, or at least B 1.

As concerning their place, that of the front shall be distant from the said
front B 1, or at the least B. That of the Breech, as is usual. That of the
Manovel or flat Transome shall touch the very half of the length of the
Carriage, and that of the Tail shall be distant from the end B 1, or at the
least.

The Trunnion holes shall be cut in the upper side, distant from the front B 3
completely, large B 1, and deep.

The Mortessing for the Axletree shall be distant from the front B 3
completely, (although some only will have them B 2) and distant from the upper
side B 2 or 1, large B 1, or at the least B 1 Thoroughly hollowed in the plain
of the Cheeks, and in the lower side, as may be said of the Culverings,
according to the Commodity of the largeness of the Cheeks.

The Axletree may be long Call. 13, round about as much as is sufficient to
comprehend the Carriage. Wheels and Locks thick Call. 1, or Call. 1. The rest
round and thick near the Carriage B 1, and without B round about.

The Wheels in Cannons even to 30l Ball, are made high in Diameter Calib. 10,
in Cannons from 30l upwards Call. 9. The Measure of the Nave, Spokes, and
Fellows as abovesaid, being of the same Diameter and proportion as those of the
Culverings.

The Iron-work of the Carriage, Axletree, and Wheels for Cannon of Battery, are
the same as for the Culverings.

In the half Cannons, and as for Cannons fashioned like Culverings, and longer
then is usual, they follow altogether the Measure and proportion of Culverings.

Chambred Cannons are not measured by the Diameter of the Chase, but by the
Chamber. Fig. XXVIII.


CHAP. IV.
Of Carriages for Cannons Petrieroes.
THE Carriages for Petrieroes have the same fashion as those for Battery, and
are long once and a half, once and two thirds, or once three quarters of its
proper Bore at the Touchhole or Mouth. The most commodious and most reasonable
is to make 1, viz. if the Soul of the Piece is long Calib. 9, the Carriage may
be Call. 15, or Call. 15.

The bigness of the Sides shall be B or B.

The breadth at the forepart B 2, B 2.

At the Middle B 1, B 2.

At the Tail B 1. B 1.

The extremity of the Tail bends and is distant from the end B 1

The Trunnion-hole is distant from the Front completely B 1, and is large or
broad B, deep (...) of its breadth.

The Mortasing for the Axletree is distant from the Front B 1, of the uppermost
side B 1, and is squared round about B.

The Transomes are thick B, and wide B, but that of the Tail B 1.

That of the forepart is distant from the same B, and from the lower side. That
of the Breech distant B from the lower side, and that of the Mannovell or flat
Transome from the uppermost side B, betwixt which and the Center of the
Trunnion-holes is such a space as is the length of the Piece from the Center of
the Trunnions to the end of the Cascabel, viz. B 5 5/7 about. That of the Tail
is distant from the end B, and from the upper and lower side Eig. XXIX.
B

The Axletree is big in the middle square B.

The Wheels are high in Diameter B 6, the Nave is thick B 2, and long B 2. The
Spokes B 1 completely, and moreover as much as is sufficient for their
Mortaising.

The Fellows thick and large B.

Yet one must observe, that in Petrieroes of a small Mouth, that the Wheels are
to be made so high, that the Pieces may arrive to the Portholes or Embrasures,
viz. of three Foot or four about in Diameter; and in the Petrieroes of a large
Mouth they do not make them higher in Diameter than five or six Feet, to the
end that they may stand covered by the Parapets ordinarily six or seven foot
high.

The Iron-work of these Carriages, Axletrees, and Wheels are the same as in
other Carriages, and like Cannons of Battery.

In measuring and proportioning these Carriages, they may be valued from the B
of the Chamber, by redoubling the number of the B of the Chase etc. and these
measures in old Petrieroes become greater, because the Chamber is larger from
the end of the Chase.

The Carriages of Petrieroes de Braga (which on land are used in Towers and
little Platforms, is a simple Cavaletto (or wooden Horse) made of a crooked
beam, with two Feet before, Fig. XXX.
on which is fixed a great Fork of one entire piece of Iron, which does Clasp
the Trunnions. And under the Feet and the Tail they put small little Wheels
joynted in, to hale along with more facility the said Cavaletto.

But sometimes this crooked Beam, in place of Fig. XXXI.
Feet before, is sustained by an Axletree with its Wheels as in other Carriages.

To make Short Carriages for all natures of Guns, one must observe, that the
half of the Carriage be just in the end of the Breech, putting the flat
Transomes below in the hinmost part of the Carriage, viz. under the half, as is
showed in the Figure 12, in a Culvering Carriage.

CHAP. V.
Of Carriages for Mortar-peeces and Trabucchoes.
FOrasmuch as Mortar-peeces are not discharged but by method, and that raised
from 45 degrees to 90, whereas other Artillery is never elevated above 45
degrees; therefore the Carriages ought to be different.

Those for Mortars are made of three Sides or Cheeks, two for Sides, and the
other for the the Bottom, all thick B of the Mortar.

Those of the Sides are large or high B 2: the Trunnion which is all mortaised
into the Cheek, occupies B, the thickness of the Cheek at the bottom B, the
other B 1, and takes up almost all the inferior part of the Mortar, viz. part
of the Chamber B, the thickness of the Breech B, leaving a void place betwixt
the Breech and the Bottom, to put the Coins more easily under.

The length in the top shall be B 3, that below B 7, whence leaving at the
forepart B 1 fastened, the Remainer may be bevil'd or without an Edge.

The Cheek at the bottom is long B 7, and large as is the Diameter of the
Trabuccho on the outside, is little more than B 1 with the Cornishes.

This length of the Carriage is necessary, to the end that the Mortar being
depressed to 45 degrees, then giving great Shocks with the Carriage in the
Horizon, and that it might not leap out, to which end it is necessary that the
length of the Carriage be at the least double the height.

Others nevertheless make them only long B 6, because perchance they never make
so low Shots.

To the Carriages commonly they never make Wheels, because in their March they
are drawn upon Wagons; nevertheless to hale them along they put underneath four
small Trucks, each made of an entire Plank, thick B, high in Diameter B 1, with
a hole for the great Axletree B about.

They bind together the Carriage with four thick Transomes across, two below,
and two aloft, which encompass all the thickness of the Sides and Wheels, with
a Plate of Iron nailed to and across in most places for strength, especially
when the Sides are made of two pieces.

The Trunnion-holes are covered within with Iron, and there also they put their
Contraforts. Within it enters the whole thickness of the Trunnions, which is
closed with a thick Plate of Iron above, which covers all the upper part, and
is there fastened with four garnishing Bolts and Pins, which pass over all the
height of the Side, and are made firm underneath.

Nevertheless the said Plates or Bands one may raise up and lay aside, every
time as you would mount or dismount your Trabuccho.

Lastly, there ought to be fastened outwardly on each Side two Rings, which will
serve to manage and carry the Engine from place to Fig. XXXII.
place.

The Trabucchi have for a Carriage a strong Frame made of two Beams, distant as
much as the Trabuccho is wide, made fast with two strong Transomes at the ends,
with the Trunnion-holes in the middle, which are locked up with its Capsquares;
and underneath are two Axletrees, on which are put two Rolers of Wood to
conduct it, where there shall be necessity, which are drawn out and taken away
when the Trabucchi is used.

END OF THE THIRD PART.
To divert the Reader after this third part, I have continued the story of the
Bridge and Engine at Antwerp, out of Hondius his Fortifications and Artillery,
being a person very like to get the knowledge of it truly, an Hollander, and one
of that party. page 96.
THere were two Vessels equipped, one called the Hope, the other the Fortune,
which was fitted by Pieter Timmerman, Ingeneer of Antwerp, and not by Frederick
Jenibelly, though he had fitted many before, as E. de Metereus in his History
relates; for he is abused, and assuredly Timmerman fitted them, and in which
he made a Chest of strong Wood and Stone in a Triangular form, as one may see
in the Figure A; As long as the Vessel, four Foot broad at the bottom, and two
at the top, and in which was put 18000 pounds of Powder. At the bottom was a
Pipe of Latten, having little holes in the middle, to give fire on all sides in
an instant, coming above the letter A, from which went out four other little
Pipes, for to give more certain fire at the time appointed. And then this Chest
was well built with with Square stones, laid in Mortass all about, then covered
with Grave-stones in the manner of the Roof of an house, and upon which
Grave-stones there were Gutters of fine Powder. And also he laid 400 Wagon-load
of Stones without Mortar or Sand, and upon the Tomb-stones in the Gutters there
were 24 Matches, which ought to fire at the prefixed time; and also they put
Poles round about to hinder the Enemy from boarding, and encompassed the Vessel
with great Pitched Casks which was to be fired, that none could possibly enter,
as the Figure does show. The said Timmerman took with him a Captain named
Lankhear, for to guide the Boats in the way, who with his Seamen did so fit it,
putting underneath a Sail, (that the Course of the River might better carry it
before) a Foot under water, and the said Captain put behind a certain Tail or
Train, viz. fastened behind the Rudder four Fathom long, and at the end was
fastened a great bundle of old Nets, with a heavy piece of Timber, which kept
the Ship steady in its course, that it could not role or sheer on either side;
and being so finished, was conducted in the night toward the Bridge, by the
said Pieter Timmerman, with other four Seamen in company to conduct the Rudder;
and so floating very near the Bridge, the said Timmerman fired the 24 Matches,
and went behind the Rudder to the other Seamen, and immediately the Pitched
Casks were on a light fire all about the Ship. They fired many shots from on
both sides the River, which forced Timmerman to retire as fast as he could,
after whom the Spaniards made many Shots, but all in vain. The Ship arriving at
the Bridge, one would have thought that Heaven and Earth had finished their
course. When the Powder took fire, it gave so great a blow under water, that
the water lept on the other side of the bank, filled the Fort on Callo side,
and laid all the fields round about under water; all the Fire and Matches were
extinguished, the greatest part of the said Fort thrown down, and the Cannon
lost. One might have seen great heavy Stones fly in the Air, and driven half a
League into the Country. It blew up six Ships of the Bridge, of which three
were so torn, that one could not so much as find a piece, the others cast and
thrown with their bottom upwards, so that the Bridge was entirely broke. There
were also more than 800 people blown up, and some persons of Quality, as the
Marquess of Reesbork, General of the Cavalry; my Lord Billy, formerly Governor
of Freeze, my Lord Torsy, and twenty three Captains, and some of the Prince of
Parma's Court, the Prince himself being in great danger; for as Metteren
relates, the Spaniards made all their Endeavors to extinguish the fire by
casting in of water, which they did all round about, (not dreaming of the
Powder, and that the Matches were then ready to fire) begun to mock at its vain
Effects, thinking that all the outward fire was the product of this Engine. The
Duke was so long time a looking on, that all the fire was quenched, but being
already retired at some distance, the Blow was given with such fury, that the
Duke, and the Marquess of Guasto, and others that accompanied them, were all
blown down, and one could not perceive the least trace of Footing of the Fort
Awsterwell. But the said Timmerman willing that they should pursue the Victory,
signified to the Lords, that there was made a sufficient hole or opening in the
Bridge; but some seeing from afar the Spaniards turning and returning with
Torches and Lanthorns upon the Bridge, could not believe that there was a
sufficient overture made, or that it had done any great effect, and therefore
did not at all follow that Advantage. In the mean time the Duke repaired it
with all imaginable diligence, much admiring that the Antwerpers and Zealanders
had not taken hold of that occasion, and given an Assault. For the breach was
so great, that the City might have been easily supplied with necessary
Provisions: and from this, one may observe, how one ought to follow a Victory
undertaken, and how one ought to conduct such Works without leaving of them in
such time, as the design is ready to take effect. Moreover the Figure (A) shows
how the Ship was fitted a Stern, with its Masons work, and the Cask; and how
the Trains and Fuses came within. Also the Matches were dipped in Oil of
Turpentine to give better fire together, for that gives a blow as swift as
Lightning. Above the Stones were Fagots with Straw, and great Trunks of green
wood fastened with chains of Iron together, all about the Ship, as the letter
(B) does show, which could not but frighten the Beholders.

THE FOURTH PART. Of charging Artillery, and Preparations for the same.
CHAP. I.
Of charging and loading of Culverings.
THE Culvering carries a ball all of Iron.

The old and small require Powder of 4, 1, and 1, as much as its proper Shot
weighs of Iron: so that if there be 30l weight of Ball, it will have 30l of
four, one, and one: or if one gives of five, one, and one, of the weight of its
proper Shot of Iron, so that if the Shot weighs 30l, the Powder of five, one,
and one shall be 24l.

The Common modern and fortified Pieces shoot Powder of five, one, and one, as
much as the just weight of the Shot; so that if that weigh 30l, it also
requires 30l of Powder of five, one, and one. Or if you would load it with
Powder of six, one, and one, you may not give it above of the weight, viz. 22l.
But these may very well support a just and equal proportion of Powder to the
weight of its Ball.

To put the Powder into the concavity of the Piece, they use either a Ladle, or
a Paper-Cartridge.

The Ladle is an Instrument of Brass, made as a gutter'd Pipe, and fixed at the
end of a Staff; the form of it is such, that for the Culvering it may serve to
load it at two or three times.

If the Culvering is to be charged at two times, the weight of the Shot must
not exceed 30 or 35l; but the said Culvering at three times may carry 35 more
of these Pounds.

To load the Common Modern and Fortified Pieces at two times with Powder of
five, one, and one, they make the Ladle with these Proportions: the part which
is nailed upon the frame of the Handle, be long three Diameters of the Shot, (I
do not say, Muzzle or Diameter of the Bore) and long one, that part which
receives the Powder be long Shots 4, and large in the bottom Shots 2 less 2/6,
and at the top Shots 2 less, that the point be round, making the Center one
Shot, or at the least. At the Ears they make inwardly two quarters of the
Circle for strength, and at the Point they cut away from some of the Diameter,
to the end that the Ladle may better touch the bottom of the Chase.

Others make large the under part for the Powder, of the largeness for the
Model or Frame, leaving each Ear large.

To charge the same Culverings, Modern and Fortified, at three times with
Powder of five, one, and one, the Ladle is made long Shots 2, the rest as the
others.

To load the Ancient small Pieces with Powder of five, one, and one, (for that
of four, one, and one is now out of use,) the said Ladle shall be shortened
about, (the two said Powders being not much different in mass or weight,) or if
with the Ladle you shall use that of five, one, and one, but smooth, not heaped
up.

To load the Common Modern Pieces with Powder of six, one, and one, the Ladle
shall be part above shorter than that of five, one, and one; or if you will
work by the same, but smooth, not filled top-full.

To load the Modern Fortified with Powder of six, one, and one, or if it shall
hold the common quantity, or if you shall yet use the same top-full, give it
the full weight of the Ball.

Lastly, to load the Old small Pieces with Powder of six, one, and one, the
Ladle shall be used, shortened or of its accustomed measure.

Observe here, that the three Powders are not proportionable in substance,
weight, and activity, whence it is that if it has the said proportion, which
is oftener more probable than true; wherefore one ought to have it made clear by
Experience.

The said thin Plate of Copper, cut out after the above said manner, is bended
round, and is nailed with Studs of Copper to one module long a Shot 1, but
something smaller before, for the fastening the Plate, and moreover long to
fasten the Staff or Handle, and Inch and in Fig. XXXIV.
Diameter, that it advance out of the Bore at the least one Foot. Besides the
Ladle there be other Materials or Preparations for the Cannon, which serve for
Charging, as the Rammer, Sponge, and Wadhook.

The Rammer is a piece of wood, round and thick one Sh. and long one Sh. about,
having a Staff or Handle like the Ladle, and serves to press and ramm home the
Powder into the Cannon, Wadd, and Shot, and is made of hard Wood, and is
sometimes plated about with a Fig. XXXV.
Plate of Copper near the head for strengths sake. Oftentimes they use upon the
same Staff both the Ladle and Rammer.

The Sponge is no other then a Rammer-head, made of soft wood, and lesser in
Diameter than the abovesaid by, wrapped round about with a Sheep's skin, and
fastened with Studs of Copper, Fig. XXXVI.
which serves to make clean and refresh the Piece

The Wadhook is another Material, made of a Rodd or great Wire of Iron, turned
in a Serpentine manner, and in its end is put upon a Handle or Staff to draw
out Wadds or Okume, that the Fig. XXXVII.
Piece may be unloaded.

CHAP. II.
Of the Charges for Field-peeces.
FIeld pieces carry a Shot of no more than 10 or 12 l of Iron, which is always
used, although sometimes in the smallest a Ball of Lead.

They are always allowed Powder of five, one, and one, of equal weight to its
Ball, if they are Common Modern or Fortified; and if they are Fortified, they
are also allowed the same weight of Powder of six, one, and one: but if they
are Old small Pieces, they are only allowed of Powder of five, one, and one, or
of that of six, one, and one.

They are loaded with the Ladle at one time with Powder of five, one, and one.
The body of the said Ladle, viz. that part which holds Fig. XXXIII.
the Powder, shall be Shot 7, as was said of the Culvering, the Model large as
accustomed, Shot 3, and long sh. 1, in the rest as those of the Culverings.

That serves for Powder of five, one, and one in Modern Pieces, and for that of
six, one, and one in Modern Fortified.

For the Small old Pieces they use the same, but smooth, not heaped up, with
Powder of five, one, and one.

CHAP. III.
Of the Allowance of Pieces of Battery.
THey are commonly charged with Shots of Iron, giving them of the weight of the
ball of Powder of four, one, and one, in the Ancient; and of five, one, and
one, in the Modern Common and Fortified.

The Cannons which carry from 30 to 35 l Shot, are loaded with a Ladle at two
times, but those which carry a greater Ball at three times. For to load at two
times, they use a Ladle long in its Cavity three Shot, with the outpart Model
or Frame which is one Shot, or little less, the rest being after the usual form.

For to load at three times, let it be long only in its cavity Shots two, and
for the Model, the rest being made as is usual.

And these serve, being smoothed, for all sorts of Powder respectively; and if
you would load Old Pecces with Powder of five, one, and one, you must use it
smoothed, nor heaped up; and moreover in loading the Modern Fortified, with
Powder of six, one, and one, they use it also smoothed, not heaped up.

For Cannon Chambred, take the Diameter of the Chamber, substract the Wind, and
the rest will serve for a Measure in making the Ladles.

For to load at two times, its Cavity must be long 3 of its Diameter; and if
for three times, let it be long 2 of its measure, the rest as is usual,

In Taper-bored Pieces, the Ladle is made according to the form of the said
Tapering, viz. narrower before than behind; near the Model Fig. XXXIX.
or Shaft the Cavity is made large Shots 2, and at the Point is made large
Diam. 2 from the bottom of the Tapering, long 3 Sh. and, or 4 and the part of
the Model large 3 Sh. and long Shots or.

CHAP. IV.
Of the Allowance for Cannons Petrieroes.
ALL Cannons Petrieroes carry a ball of Stone, or some Artificial body, as
Sacks, small Barrels, Cases of wood, bags filled with Stones, and Bur-shot, but
never heavier than the ball of Stone.

Petrieroes have their Chambers large 2/6 of the Mouth, they are allowed Powder
of five, one, and one, of the weight of its Stone-ball, and are loaded at one
time with a Ladle long in its Mouth two Diameters of the Chamber (substracting
the Vent,) the rest framed as is usual. Others say, that the Ladle long in the
Cavity B 1 of the Chamber, will load at two times the third of the Stone-ball.

To Petrieroes large in the Chamber, the half of the B are allowed Powder of
five, one, and one, commonly the half of the weight of the Stone-ball, and are
loaded either at one time with a Ladle long B 2 of the Chamber, or at two times
with a Ladle long B 1 of the Chamber, taking away the Vent, and the rest, as
usually is made.

Others nevertheless say by experience, that in these Petrieroes the Ladle
being long (setting aside the Wind) B 3, gives at two times one third of the
weight of the Ball, and at three times the half of the weight of the Ball of
Powder of five, one, and one.

In the following Petrieroes is given Powder of five, one, and one, in weight
of the Stone-ball, and the Ladle long in the Cavity Ball to load at one time.

The Chambred Petrieroes are more easily loaded with Cartridges (of which we
shall speak) than with the Ladle; they also put the Cartridges cut open in that
part toward the Touchhole upon a Cartridge Ladle of wood, made in form of a
Roof-Tile of a great house, as great as is the Open of the Chamber, and
altogether Fig. XL.
is thrust forward into the Chamber. Then the Chamber is sloped up with a
Tampion of soft wood put in by a Spears point, as Fig. 41 shows. Then it is
well rammed in with Fig. XLI,
a Rammer, having a small Wheel made underneath, and two Handles a cross, as
the Fig. 42. Fig. XLII.
and under which they put a Wadd of Hay or Okame, to the end the said Tampeon
in driving may not break by the Stone-ball, and after which they put another
Wadd without toward the Muzzle.

The Petrieroes de Braga carry the same Charge as the others. The Powder is put
into the Moscolo or Chamber, and is closely shut up with a Tampeon and a Shot
put into the Chase with a Wadd before and behind, and the Moscolo is fitted
into the Braga, and closed with a Coin of Iron behind.

CHAP. V.
The Charge of Mortars.
THE Mortars or Trabuccho's are loaded as the Petrieroes, with Stone-shot, but
oftener with Artificial fires, Bombes, Bags filled with Hail-shot, and Stones,
but not heavier than the Ball.

The Powder is not always of the same quantity, but sometimes more, sometimes
less, according to the intention of the Gunner. The Ordinary is of the weight
of the Stone-ball, which being put into the Chamber is closed up with a Tampeon
of Wood, and above is Rammed a Wadd of Hey or Okame before the ball of Stone;
but in shooting Artificial Fires they do not work with a Tampeon, to the end
that the Fire of the Chamber may kindle the Fire Ball or Granadoe.

CHAP. VI.
Of Cartridges of Powder.
ALL Pieces of Artillery are loaded with Powder after two manners, viz. either
with a Ladle as aforesaid, or with Cartridges, which are used in Forts by
night; and upon the Sea, for dispatch and security in not firing the Powder.
They serve for all sorts of Pieces, but principally for the Inchambred.

They are made of Cloth or Canvas sewed upon its Funnels, or of Paper sewed or
glewed; being fitted, they are so thick, that they may conveniently enter into
the Chase or Concave for which they are made: therefore the largeness of the
Paper or Canvas shall be always three Diameters of the Bore or Chase, or
Chamber. Its Former must be of the same Diamer, the Length is diverse according
to the Piece for which they are to serve, and according to the Powder which
they are to contain. For the Culverings they may be long Shots four; for the
Cannon of Battery, three almost; for the Petrieroes, two Bores of their
Chamber. Nevertheless it is good to weigh the Powder, which one puts within,
and to see how much it takes up in practice. Fig. XLIII, XLIV.


For those of Canvas, one may take a Former, and of the other part a Ligature
or binding, giving therefore to the Canvas half a Bore more Fig. XLV. XLVI.
in length.

Before you put your Cartridges into the Chase, you cut and open that part
which is near the Touchhole.

CHAP. VII.
Of Artificial Bodies used in stead of Shot, viz. Bags filled with Hail-shot,
Case-shot, Tunnel-shot, Base and Bur, and Bombe or Grenades.
THey do not always charge Artillery with Iron-shot or Stone, but oftentimes
with other Artificial Bodies, or bags of Hail, Case, Base and Bur-shot, and
Bombes.

The Bags are made of Canvas, and are filled with small shot of Lead of one or
two Ounces, which serve to load Field-peeces, and those for the Cannon for to
scatter wide abroad, either in the Field or upon the Walls in the time of an
Assault. They are in Diameter 1 Sh. in length 1. Those of small Artillery weigh
one time and a half more than the Iron-shot; those for Cannon are of the same
weight as the Iron-shot. The Shots are placed in order, and the Bags without
are tied with good Twine, which passes betwixt the Chinks of the Balls,
crossing like a Lettice. Fig. XLVII.


The Cases of Wood serve for Petrieroes, and Cannon of Battery, are made in
form of a Cylinder or Column, with two Funnels or Squares of the same wood,
distant one from the other one or two Inches. They are filled with Lead-shot,
Stones, Chain-shot, pieces of Iron, etc. Although some make the Tonnels Fig.
XLVIII.
narrower at one end than the other, but neither ought to be heavier than the
Stone-shot.

The Tonneletti or Tonnel-shot are as the Case-shot, but have their Pipe stands
equally in Diameter at both ends, and are bound about with two Hoops of Iron or
thin Plates, in the Fig. XLIX.
middle of one is fastened a piece of Cord to draw it out of the Piece, as
occasion serves. They are filled with the same materials as the Cases of Wood.

The Stuffies are made of soft Iron Wire, woven as a Net, and are filled with
the abovesaid Ingredients, are closed up as a Purse, and serve Fig. L.
properly for Mortars.

The Bombes, are great balls of Iron or Brass hollow in the midst, and in which
are put fine sifted Powder; and they give them a due fire by a Fuse, or small
Trunk of Wood or Mettle filled with Powder, or other beaten substance, to the
end that the Bombes may break as soon as they are come amongst the Enemies.
They are used by Calibres of Iron from 50, 100, to 300l, with such a vacuum
that may only commodiously weigh the half. They are different from Grenades
only in bigness, because the Grenades are less, and are cast by hand, are of
Calib. of Iron of 15l, and with such a vacuum, that they may only weigh about.
Some to save charge are made of Glass and Earth, but do not so great effect,
and therefore are seldom used.

Furthermore, there are used diverse Fireballs, the making of which you may
learn from Fire-Masters.

END OF THE FOURTH PART.
A farther Relation of the making of the Bridge over the Scheld near Antwerp,
and of the Effects of the Fireships; taken out of Famianus Strada, the sixth
Book of his last Part.
ABout the latter end of the Summer 1584, the most worthy Captain and General,
Alexander Prince of Parma, with less than 20000 Soldiers besieged Antwerp,
Ghent, Tendermond, Bruxels, and Mecklin, all at once, and within the year took
them, and many other Cities besides. Antwerp, a great City, wherein were 100000
Souls, besides Seamen and Watermen, and whereto belonged above 1000 goodly
Vessels, and was then the greatest City of Trade in the world, put the Prince
most to it, having the River Scheld open, and thereby supplied with all
Provisions and Ammunition from Zealan^ and Holland. That after some time he
found, that unless he could bridle the River by a Bridge, it was not possible
for him with so few Forces to take the Town. Therefore betwixt Antwerp and
Lillo, a little more than midway, over against Callo, he resolved to build a
Bridge, and to that end built two Quadrangular Forts, that on Flanders side
called St. Mary's, and that on Brabant side St. Philip; and close to the water
side at both ends, where he intended the Bridge should end, he built two strong
Batteries or Castles, 50 Foot square, upon long and big Timbers, and furnished
them both with very great Guns, on purpose to stop the Vessels, and secure the
Carpenters and Workmen upon the Bridge, and to be a Magazine for Ammunition.
And to the end he might bring Timber, Ships, and other Materials for this great
work, (after the Delivery of Ghent) he cut a Navigable River fourteen Miles
long, which fell into the Scheld near Callo, by which he was supplied with
Victuals and other Provisions, as well as Materials for the Bridge abundantly.
The River at this place was about 2400 Feet over betwixt the two Castles, and
toward Flanders side for 200 Feet, and on Brabant side for 900 the River was
not so deep, but that long Timbers might be fixed into the bottom of the River,
it being sandy and sound; therefore at the distance of eleven Feet, and
thirteen alternately, there were with Bell Beetles at each distance three long
Rafters driven into the bottom of the River, five Foot asunder, and formed like
a Trussel or Peer, [as our Bridges at Stanes, and like to Downham and Stow
Bridges over the Oase in Norfolk] and bound with cross beams and Timbers. These
Rafters or great Timbers, when driven sufficiently down, were cut equally high,
and mortaised into a strong Timber, to bear the Liggers of the Bridge. Of these
Peers or Trussels there were 18 toward Flanders, and 74 toward Brabant, all
strongly covered with Plank 12 Foot wide, and on each side a Brest-work five
Foot high Musket proof, and eight Soldiers might well march a breast on the top.
Before each Peer or Trussel there were many strong Piles driven triangular
ways, for the keeping Vessels from running upon the Bridge, and at 20 Foot
distance on either side great Piles driven to that end. Now for the Remainer of
the River, that lay betwixt these two ends, which was near upon 1300 Feet, and
which was so deep that no Piles could reach the bottom, there were thirty two
Ships or Vessels brought down Alexander's new River, of 66 Feet long and 12
Feet wide (called with us Bylanders) and placed with Ankers and Iron Chains, in
a fourfold row, 22 Foot asunder, so as they might rise and fall with the Tides,
which was about 12 Foot,) and the space betwixt each Ship was laid over with
five long Beams, plank'd, and had Breast-works, and was as wide as the Bridges
before named were. On every Ship stood thirty Soldiers, and four Seamen, with
two great Guns, one at each end of the Vessel. There were for the Defense of
this Bridge near 100 great Guns ready planted into the two great Castles and
Vessels, besides the great Guns in the Forts St. Mary and St. Philip. This
Bridge being thus finished, it yet was thought fit, before and behind the Ships
or Vessels (viz. for 1300 Feet) to arm the same with eleven Barricadoes, (like
half Moons before Bridges or Gates.) Each Barricado was made of three great
Lighters, made fast to one another, and formed in fashion of a Triangle, with
three Ankers and Chains, to suffer them to rise and fall with the Tides: these
were covered over with Masts and great Timbers, and stood about 100 Feet one
from another, and were placed some 150 Feet from the Bridge both ways. From
each of these Barricadoes came out 40 long Piles sharpened at the ends, and
armed with Iron, to terrify the Vessels, lest by running upon them, they
should be destroyed. The Lighters were filled with empty Cask, Iron bound, lest
they should sink by Accident. Lastly, the Prince armed forty Vessels, twenty
on each side, for the defense of this Bridge, and so after seven Months hard
working, this great Work was finished, and gave passage to all, and the day was
solemnized with great Joy. The Antwerpians were more remiss in hindering the
Progress of the making the Bridge, because they thought it was impossible, and
said, that the Scheld would no more endure any to bridle it, then the Free
Belgians would endure the Spaniard' s Yoke: but when they saw the Work proceed
on, and be almost finished: They sent a Spy out of Antwerp to view it, and
bring them an account of the Prince's Actions, who was discovered and brought
to the Prince; but contrary to expectation was sent to see all the Forts and
Castles, and Bridge, and bid by the Prince to go and tell them that sent him,
what he had seen; and to assure them, that he should not depart from that
Bridge, before he should find either a Tomb under it for his Grave, or to pass
over it into the City. The first thing that the Antwerpians did, was by help of
Seamen in the Night to cut the Cables of the Floats or Barricadoes under water,
which to some they did, which presently the Prince altered to Iron Chains; and
most of this time was spent by the Antwerpian Ingeneers, to whom was sent an
Italian by Queen Elizabeth, called Frederick Jembelly, one that had
extraordinary skill in Fireworks, and was famous for the same, neglected by
the Spaniards, and therefore willing to do them all the mischief he could.
These Ingeneers prepared many Fireships for the destruction of the Bridge, many
whereof came to little effect. There were two made, called the Hope, and
Fortune, of about 100 Tun apiece: there were in each Vaults made of Stone and
Mortar, filled with 200 barrels of Powder each, and above great quantities of
Grave Stones, Millstones, and other great Stones formed up into an Angle, and
the Concavity at the top was filled with balls of Iron, Marble, Chains of Iron,
old Ankers, Plow-Coulters, and all that these Infernal Workmen could devise to
destroy men withal, [a more perfect description whereof you had at the end of
the third Part.] The Prince hearing of all these Preparations, was not idle to
strengthen his Guards, and make ready for their coming, which was on the 8th of
April at night 1585, when behold first three Vessels appeared from the Town all
on fire, afterward other three, and so three after three, 'till fifteen
Vessels came down, and burnt so as if all those Vessels had been one fire. Had
not the Spectators been full of Care and Fear, certainly a more pleasant
Spectacle could not be seen; all the Bridge, Castles, Forts, and sides of the
River were full of the Prince's people with their Colors, most with Torches in
their hands, and all the Vessels with Fireworks burning, so that it was light
as day. Thus came these Vessels, directed by Seamen and Pilots, within 2000
Paces of the Bridge, down the Channel; when as those Seamen and Pilots firing
their Trains and Matches, leapt into their Boats, and went back to observe what
success their Engines would have. But the Vessels kept not their Channels as
was expected, but some went one way, some another; four sunk in the midst, some
run a ground on Callo side, and some were boldly boarded by the Prince's
Soldiers, the Matches put out, and Vessels taken. This made all the Beholders
rejoice, and scoff at these Engines, when behold the greatest Vessel, that had
all those dreadful Fires and Stones, and was fitted purposely for destruction,
came clear off all the Barricadoes and Floats, and fell close to the Bridge,
which drew the Prince of Parma thither with the most of his principal Officers,
who command the Seamen and Soldiers to put out and quench the Fires, being
ignorant of the Infernal works within, and that all this time the Fusees were
burning in order to the great Blast that followed. There was a Spanish Ensign,
whether by the knowledge he had of Jambelly, or by Divine Instinct, that upon
his knees desired the Prince to get far from that Vessel; the Prince was angry
with him, but when the Ensign with more courage begun to press him, He, with
Guasto and Cajetanus, two great Lords, departed toward St. Mary's Fort, leaving
the Lords Billy and Rubais in the Castle or wooden Battery at the end of the
Bridge, with many other Commanders; but just as the Prince with these Lords
were entering into St. Mary's, the Fusees had come to the Powder, and this
deadly Vessel broke, and gave so great a Crack, that one should have thought
the Heavens had come down, and the whole body of the Earth had been shaken; and
throwing abroad those dreadful Stones, Chains, Shot, etc. there followed a
lamentable slaughter, such as never had been heard of before. For though the
Prince had been gone a quarter of a Mile from the Bridge, yet not only
Himself, but the Marquess, and all those by him, were violently blown to the
ground, and some taken up for dead. That Castle or Battery next St. Marys, at
the Bridge-end, wherein were the aforesaid Lords, and many Commanders,
Soldiers, many great Guns and Arms were all driven as leaves before the Wind,
and sunk down, without saving any Man's life, or leaving any sign of such a
place. The Scheld showed its bottom, and his Waters arose above the banks, and
filled the Country a Foot deeper of Water than before; the Earth did shake for
9000 Paces off; the great Grave and Millstones were some of them found a 1000
Paces from the Bridge buried deep in the ground; many were killed who were near
the Fire, many by the Water, and diverse by the evil stink that was made there.
Some were blown many Paces off into the River, and yet saved alive. The number
of those that were slain amounted to near 1000, and near as many hurt and
wounded. This was a lamentable Night, nothing but Groans and Mourning to be
heard; all lamented for the Prince, thinking he had been in the wooden Fort
that was destroyed, neither was he ever so near Death, being taken up sore
bruised, and not able to speak, Ld Guasto having hold of his Legs, and Cajetane
wounded with a Brick in the Head. But a little after the Prince recovered, and
returned to the Bridge, where he found the Castle or Battery quite gone, six of
his Ships tore to pieces, much of the Bridge torn and shaken, many of his
faithful Captains and Soldiers killed, and his Dearest Friends, Lords Billy and
Rubais blown away. Yet for all this, calling together the Remainder of his Men,
and many Commanders coming with their men from many parts to him, by the reason
of the noise of the Blow, he so encouraged them, that before Light Day, by
gathering together the Masts, Rasters, and Vessels, and other Materials, he had
closed up the Breach, so that the Soldiers and Footmen might walk over, and
which amazed the Antwerpians above the Bridge, and the Zelanders below, that
they did not believe the Bridge was broken, which was only the cause the Town
was not relieved, there lying 200 Sail at Lyllo ready to come to the City, etc.

Thus much out of Strada, by which and the former Discourses, at the end of
each Part, it will be easy for the Reader to understand this great Action, far
exceeding Caesar's Bridge over the Rhyne, and equalling great Alexander's
Actions at Tire. And I have been more desirous to set this punctually down,
because in a great measure it was the cause of England's safety in that
terrible year 1588, being done but three years before, and being fresh in the
Spaniards memory, caused them, upon sight of the English Fireships, coming
burning toward their Fleet before Calais, to cry Jembelly, Jembelly, cut their
Cables, and many Ships run themselves a shore.

THE FIFTH PART: Of shooting in great Artillery.
CHAP. I.
Of necessary Operations before Shooting.
TO shoot securely in Great Ordnance, it is necessary that the Piece be first
well Tertiated or Squared upon its Carriage, and that one knows duly to Load
and Level the Piece.

To Tertiate a Piece, is to know if it has its due thickness at the three
places, viz. Touchhole, Trunnions, and Neck; if the Trunnions are rightly
placed, and the Chase straight.

To Quadrate a Piece mounted, is to see if it is directly placed, and equally
poised: which diligence is used in the Carriage, in regard of the Wheels and
Axletree. Also to Quadrate a Piece, signifies to find in the Unequal Superficies
of the Base and the Muzzle-ring, the point which is perpendicular over the Soul
of the Piece or Cilinder, which is done by an Instrument called the Level,
hanging upon both Cornishes, and when the Thread covers the proper Mark, moving
by little and little the Lead, until it touches the Cornish, which shall be
the Point required. See the Fig. 52. But it will be Fig. LII.
more exact and easy to have the Level in the Interior Base, and in it marked
strait the Point from the perpendicular line, which touching immediately the
Cornish, will show you the desired Point. One may do the same thing with a Fig.
LIII.
small Line cross the Cornish, with two Plummets which touch the said Cornish,
and dividing the part of the Line comprehended betwixt the Plummets in two
equal parts, the Point of the Cornish which shall be under the said Division,
shall be that required. See Fig. 54. Fig. LIVE.


For what belongs to the Muzzle-ring, this manner will be easiest. That one
stick a little piece of Wood cross the Mouth, which represents the Diameter, in
the middle of which equally distant from the ends, are noted or marked a Point;
then hanging a Plummet, and making it touch the Center, you shall see noted
above the Point desired. Fig. LV.


These Points upon the Rings serve to place the Dispart.

The things belonging to load a Piece have been before spoken of.

To Dispart a Piece, is to place, fix, or elevate upon the unequal Point of the
Muzzle-ring a Mark, (which is ordinarily done with a little Wax Candle,) as far
distant from the Cylinder of the Piece, as is the Point of the Base-ring; to
the end that the Visual Ray which passes by these marks, may be parallel to
the said Chase, to make Shots at Point blank.

To find the Dispart, viz. the difference of the Semidiameters of the
Cornishes, which is either with Calliper Compasses, or with a Priming Iron
thrust into the Touchhole to the opposite part of the Chase, placing that
difference upon the top of the Cornish-ring near the Muzzle, over the Middle of
the inferior Cylinder.

CHAP. II.
Of several Differences and Ranges of Shot.
AS to the several Shootings in Artillery, the Ball being shot out, flies
through the Air with a violent, mixed, and natural motion describing a
Parabolical Line, in whose beginning and end are lines sensibly straight, and
in the middle curved. In the beginning the Impres^ Force driving forwards by
the Fire the natural gravity of the Ball, describes a right line; i^ the
middle that force diminishing, and the natural gravity prevailing, decscribeth
a crooke^ line; in the end the natural gravity overcoming the Impressed Force,
which becomes weak or altogether faints, describes of a new a right line in
which the Ball tends toward the Center of the Earth, as toward a place
natural to all heavy bodies, as does show the Fig. 56. Fig. LVI.


The Shooting or Shots in Artillery are therefore three. The first called Point
Blank, is that space that the Ball flies in a line sensibly right, without any
inclination.

The second called the Mean, which comprehends all that space the Shot flies in
a curved line.

The third, called the Dead Shot, which is the fall of the Ball by a sensible
right line, toward the Center of the World, after that the violence is ceased.

The Gunners do take notice of these three parts of a Range, for three several
ends.

Those shots of Point Black serve to batter the Rampires and Walls of Forts and
Castles.

The middle of the Range or Mean, to molest a far off the Troops in the
Campaigne, and in their Quarters, and to ruin the Houses within Cities,
Castles, etc.

The Dead Shots serve for Mortars or Trabucchoes, and Bombes, and other
Artificial Fires, to be shot upon the Enemy, especially when they cannot be
otherways offended, nor seen, being covered behind with Ramparts, Trenches,
Hills, and other Eminencies.

A shot Point Blank, which is the most ordinary and most important, is
distinguished into two manners, viz. in regard of the Horizon, and in regard of
the Object which it strikes.

As to the Horizon they are of three sorts, first Level, secondly from Low to
High, thirdly from High to Low, called under Metal.

The Horizontal, and by the Level of the Chase, is the most secure of all the
rest.

That from low to high proves fallacious, because by the recoyling which the
Piece makes, the Shot flies higher than the Mark.

And that from under, or from high to low, is most fallacious, because the
Shot, besides other notable effects, comes more low by the recoyling of the
Piece. Therefore an Experienced Gunner must remedy these faults, by taking the
due advantages in shooting.

As to the Object, a shot Point Blank, is made either at right Angles against
the Superficies of the Object, or at oblique Angles.

At right Angles it strikes more furiously than at oblique Angles, therefore it
is used against strong Walls to batter them, and are used to make Batteries
Cameretta, or Tire by Tire; which is done by discharging all the Pieces of
Battery against the self same Mark, and in the same instant, Holding it for a
Maxim, that ten Cannons discharged together, do far more Execution than
dicharged one after another.

At oblique Angles, they strike either Cross-ways, or rebounding like a
Tennis-ball.

If they strike cross-ways, with two Batteries, one upon each side of the
Object, it ruins more speedily the Defense either of Earth or Wall.

If they Batter obliquely, or by a Rebound, which is done when they cannot do
it right forward; as if one would batter a Flank covered with an Orillion or
Shoulder, one must strike the Curtain in so fit a place and oblique^y, so that
by the rebound the Shot may leap into the Flank, holding for a Maxim in this
operation, that the Angles of Incidence and Reflection are equal.

The middle Ranges are diverse, according to the diverse Elevations of the
Artillery.

The Elevations are regulated by the Gunners Square, which is an Instrument of
Brass, made of two right Lines, one longer than the other, both which makes a
right Angle, from which as from the Center is described an Arch divided into 90
degrees, or into 12 equal parts called Points; and moreover the said Arch
exceeds a Quadrant by 45 degrees or 6 Points, and this Excess serves for
shooting below the Horizon as the Quadrant does for above; and from the Center
hangs a Thread with a Plummer, whose Leg being placed in the Chase, cutting the
Arch, does show the degrees of Elevation, or Depression. See the Fig. 57.

In this mean shooting one does observe, that always goes farthest from the
Horizon which has some Elevation, and especially that of most points of
Elevation, even to 6 points or 45 degrees, which is said to be the greatest
Elevation, which one never exceeds in long Cannons.

The dead Shot is that which is commonly worked with the Trabucchi or Mortars,
and is done by giving Elevation from the points 6 or 45 degrees to the points
12 or 90 degrees, which are measured by the abovesaid Square; or with a
particular Instrument like a Level, putting a Staff a cross the mouth of the
Mortar, and upon that the Quadrant.

In shooting in these is observed, that at the sixth Point is the farthest off,
and that at the seventh Point comes the nearest; and that at the eighth nearer,
and so nearer and nearer to the twelfth Point, in which the Ball falls, in the
same place from which it departed.

THE LAST CHAPTER.
Of the Length of Ranges.
FOrasmuch as the Randoms or Ranges in a Piece of Point blank, and of the
greatest Elevation, is difficult to be known without the Experience of every
Point; yet in the War, for the length of every Cannon's shot, they generally
compute the length of three Musket shot, which will be from 400, to 450
Venetian Geometrical Paces. A Geometrical Pace is 5 Foot, and the proportion
betwixt the Venetian Foot and Ours, is as 1000 to 1153. Therefore here the
proportion will be from 460 to 518 English Paces.


Nevertheless for more particular knowledge, these following Measures may serve,
being English Geometrical Paces.

Shots. P: Blanke. Greatest Elevat. Smeriglio, Base, or Rabonet. 207. 691.
Falconet about 3l. 322. 1843. Falcon, about 6l. 392. 3226. Sacre, about 10l.
634. 4032. Demi-Culvering, about 14l. 783. 4378. Colebrina, or Culv. about 30l.
1382. 5760. Culvering, about 50l. 1498. 6106.

Cannons of Battery shoot less than Culverings of equal Calibre.

But Demi-Cannons and Quarter-Cannons, fashioned like Culverings, shoot little
less than Culvering of equal Calibre.

Cannons Petrieroes, loaded with Artificial bodies, as Chain-shot, Case-shot,
Barrel-shot, shoot not much farther than a Musket.

Of Shot made out of Mortars and Trabucchoes, betwixt the Middle or Mean shot,
and the Dead shot, is to be observed by Experience; those are equal, which are
equally removed from the sixth Point of the Quadrant, viz. that the Bombe fall
as far distant being shot from the same Piece, and with the same strength at
the fifth as at the seventh Point, and the same thing at the fourth as at the
eighth, and as much at the third as at the ninth, and second as at the tenth.

Shots from Mortar-peeces are more fallacious, sometimes flying farther,
sometimes shorter than needs, and the Bombes break in the Air, sometimes after
the Fall they do not break, which gives time to the Enemy to retire, or to
choke it; therefore if you would have a just blow, and to take effect, these
following Advertisements must be observed.

Advertisements.
1. One ought exactly to know how many Paces are to the place which you would
shoot, which may be done with an Instrument.

2. That the Bombes, or other bodies which are to be shot, be of equal weight,
otherwise the shots will vary.

3. That the Carriage in breadth may be always upon a Level, and without any
Descen^ that it do not leap in discharging.

4. That the Powder, with which the Mortar is loaded, be always of the same
force and weight.

5. That the Charge of the Mortar, as well in Powder as in Wadding, may be
always ramm'd in with blows equally heavy, and o^ equal number.

6. That the Wadds be always either of Wood, or Tampeons, or else of untwisted
Okam, for the strongest drives it farthest.

7. That the Fuses be newly made in those days that they are to be used, and
that they be made of a mixture proportionable to the Range that the Shot shall
make in the Air, and that it break in the very Fall.

To make the Bombes break in the Fall, the skill is in the Fusee filled with
mixture of Composition, which is to be such, that although the Bombe fall in
the water, it ought to break.

To measure a just time, is done by filling the Fusee after the ordinary
manner. Moreover take a small Barrel or Cane of Iron, of equal Bore to that of
the Fuse, but something longer, with many little Holes all along its length,
and filling it in the same manner as the Fuse. Then the Bombe being fitted in
the Mortar, you give fire in the same time to the Fuse in the Mortar and the
Iron Barrel, letting the Barrel burn until that you see the Bombe break, in
which moment you observe the Barrel, and to what hole the Fire burns down,
which will give an assured mark of the time that the Fuse ought to have.

If the Bombe in the very Fall shall break, the same quantity of Composition
shall be continued in the Fuse; but if it break before the Fall, you must abate
the heat, by adding a small mixture of Charcoal-dust incorporated in the same
composition: and if after its Fall it shall delay its effect, then you shall
join with its mixture a little fine Powder-dust. And so you may by experience
with this Barrel observe unto what mark or hole it burns; so that with such
Fuses the Bombe shall justly break in the very Fall amongst the Enemies;
afterward observing always to fill the said Barrel with the first Mixture.

Being necessitated to use an Okam Wadd in lieu of a Tampeon, as was first
used, so the Load of the Mortar shall be augmented to such a proportion, that
the Bombe may carry to the same place, as it did when it was loaded and stopped
with a Tampeon, or if it shall require another Elevation.

The Use of the Table before set down.
To see the different Randoms caused by the different Wadds of Okam and Wood, I
have made the Experiment in Mortars and Bombes of 100l weight in a plain field,
which loaded equally and weighing each 55l, and the Chamber loaded with fine
Powder of five, one, and one, 20 onz. and the Chamber stopped with a Tampeon of
Wood, and with the Elevation of the Mortar to 45 degrees. I say to the point of
the Quadrant 6, the Bombe fell distant 600 Geometrical Paces. 691 English Paces.


Then with the same Mortar, Load, Bombe, and Elevation, but with an Okam Wadd
in stead of a Tampeon, the Bombe fell only distant 480 553 Englsh Paces.
Geometrical Paces.

For these two different, and all other Randoms the aforesaid Table will serve;
in which one may see the Proportion each Shot shall make, with the Elevation of
degree to degree, interposing the proportional Numbers, with which and with the
help of the Golden Number, or Rule of Three, one may find what shall be the
Random made in this or any other Mortar, at any Elevation, at 45 degrees, or
any other degree being first known.

Example I.
Let it be propounded, that a Mortar of 300 with a Tampeon of Wood, and
Elevation of 45 degrees, or Points of the Quadrnt 6, carry a Ball 800 Paces; if
one would know with the same Charge how many Paces it will shoot at the
Elevation of 54 degrees.

See then, that at the said 54 degrees of the Table corresponds the
proportional Numb. 9511, and at the abovesaid Elevation of 458, or points of
the Quadrant 6, corresponds the proportional Number 10000, which by the Golden
Rule is so worked.

If 10000 gives me 800, so 9511 gives me the number of Paces which is required.

Thus I Multiply 9511 by 800, and Divide the Product by 10000, the Quotient
will be 760, which are the Paces that the Mortar will shoot the Ball, with the
Elevation of 54 degrees.

Example II.
Let it be granted or supposed, that a Mortar of 300, at the Elevation of 54
degrees, shoots the Bombe 760 Paces; if one should desire to know what
Elevation one ought to give to the same to shoot the Bombe 550 Paces, you must
work by the Golden Rule in this manner.

As 760 Paces give the Number proportional 9510, so 550 Paces will give its
proportional Number.

Wherefore if you multiply the second 9510 by the third 550, and dividing the
Product by the first 760, the Quotient will be 6882, which Number, if you seek
it amongst the proportional Numbers in the Tables, and not finding it just, if
you take its nearest, it shall be the number 6947, to which corresponds the
degrees 68, which shall be the Elevation, and which ought to be given to the
Mortar of 300, to fall in the distance of 550 Paces, with the same Charge of
the first, and that is as much as I esteem necessary for every Soldier as well
as for a Gunner, who intends to be serviceable for his Prince and Country.

Of the Petarr.
A Petarr, is a Machine in form of a Mortar, which being loaded with Powder,
and placed with its Mouth against Gates, or other wooden Engines, and giving
fire, breaks and ruins them.

This Instrument was first invented by a Thief, or Robber, being first made of
Wood, and bound about with Iron, not only against Houses, but also to enter
into Towns; which being observed to work admirable effects, it was afterward
put into Exeeution by Princes against the Cities of their Enemies: and to give
them greater Force, they made these Petarrs of Iron, but afterward finding
them too brittle, they were made of Brass, as they are now in use.

The Substance of which the Petard is made of, is an Union or commixture of
Copper, English Tin, and Latten well refined. Some do vary both in proportion,
and also in the Metal, since that some would have them all of beaten Copper,
without any other mixture: others to every 50l of Brass, 5l of Tin, and two of
Latten. Others to every 10l of Brass one of Latten.

The Copper therefore is soft, the Tin gives it hardness, but if it be overmuch
it makes it brittle; they would have the Latten mixed with the Copper and Tin
together.

The Proportions for the Petarr.
THe Guide-line is divided into 24 equal parts, of which 16 is the Diameter of
the Mouth.

The Diameter of the Concave at the Bottom, 10.

The Thickness of the Metal at the Breech, 2.

The Thickness of the Metal at the Mouth, 1.

The Cornice is one part. 1.

The Touchhole is distant from the bottom of the Guide, part. 8.

Some make it perpendicular to the Guide, and others perpendicular to the
Metal; but as well in the one as other fashion, it is terminated in the said
point of the Guide.

Some soder or fasten the said little Barrel or Canetta, and others make it to
enter with a Screw; the Joynting or Mortaising of the Mouth is part.

The Greatness of the Petarr is diverse, according to the diversity of Matters
which it ought to break, but all have the self same Proportion above named.

To break down Bridges they are long in the Guide a Gometrical Foot, which is
commonly divided into 12 Inches. Which is almost 14 Inches En:


2. To break double Bridges they are high in the Guida 11 Inches. 12 Inches
Engl.


3. To break ordinary Bridges reasonable strong, you must allow in the Guida 8
Inches.

4. To break Barriers, Grates, Portcullis, Pallizadoes, they are made high 11
Inches.

They load a Petarr with the finest Powder that can be made, well fifted and
dusted. They do not fill the whole, but only of its length, and ram the
Powder in from time to time to make it close, but not so strongly as to uncorn
it.

The Powder, which is put within shall be of weight, for the

First subtle Pound from 9 to 10. For the second from 6 to 7. For the third
from 5 to 7. For the Fourth from 3 to 4.

Above the Powder they put a round piece of Past-board thick, and stops it an
Inch about, and above that they cast Pitch and Wax melted together, but not
over-hot, and above which you put a round piece of Wood well fitted, and above
all a round piece of Cloth waxed, which is driven into the Joint, or, is tied
without with a Cord about the Edge, and all this that it may not receive water
or moisture.

The Touchhole is made near the bottom, but better than a third part distant
from it; because the Powder will be sooner fired, and the Recoyl will be
greater.

In the Touchhole they fix a Spindle or little prick of Metal to a Screw,
which penetrates to the middle of the Powder; and this is filled with
Composition for a time, that the Petarr-Master, and his Company may have time
to retreat, and secure themselves, and may resist water.

So you may take fine Powder 3 parts.

Sulphur 6. Saltpetre 9.

All these Ingredients being stamped and mingled, putting above oil of Stone by
little and little, so that they may impast together, and letting them well dry
in the Sun. Then load the Fuse, or take Powder 2 onz. Sulf. 2 onz. Saltpetre 3
onz. Camfire 1 onz. beaten small, and fill the Fuse.

To the Petarr there are one or more Handles for to fasten the Madrill,
although the Orl or Edge serve to nail it about.

The Madrillo is a strong beam of wood of Elm or Oak, shod with Iron, which is
placed before the Mouth of the Petarr, and fastened to the Gate which you would
break, to make greater ruin. For every Petarr the Madrill is long B 3 of its
Petard, measured and comprehending the Edge, and large 2 of the B.

The thickness is ordinarily of four Inches more or less, according to the
strength that you are to batter.

Cross to the Madrillo there are two bars of Iron Diagonally let into the wood,
each being thick of an Inch, nailed to it.

The Madrill with the Petard is fastened to the Gate in several manners,
according to the nature of the thing which you intend to ruin, since that the
Gate may have a Ditch, or if not, it may be well lined with Iron, or not at all.

Therefore if it have a Ditch, it must be hung on with a small Bridge; but if
it is without Ditch, or strengthened with Iron, it may be fastened with a Plank;
or if armed with a Fork or Rest, and in other particular manners, which would
be too long further to explain.

THE END OF THE PETARD.
Advice for Ship-Gunners, out of Furnier's Hydrography, p. 95.
Of Canoneers necessary for the security of a Ship.
BEfore Cannon was invented, they did use both at Sea and Land certain Machines
which did throw Fire, Arrows, Stones, and Beams of Wood, which did as much
damage to the Enemy as our Cannon, but were not so easy to be governed. We do
not know what were those Engines that Archimedes did use for the Defense of
Syracuse, only we are certain, that he had those which did cast great Stones a
vast distance, and as Plutarch observes, with Smoke, and a great Noise, and
that he had Burning-glasses which did burn at indeterminated distances.

In the Advice, which in times past the Emperor Leon gave to his Admirals and
Sea-Captains, in several places he makes mention of Engines which did vomit
fire and flames in close fights, and Sea Combats. And the Roman History does
relate, that Mithridates besieging Rhodes by Sea, after he had made a breach
did great damage to the Besieged by the means of a Sambuque or warlick
Instrument of Prodigious greatness, which being placed upon two Galleys, cast
forth at one blow great number of Arrows, Stones, and Beliers, being square
pieces of Timber pointed with Iron at both ends. All these Engines being very
incommodious and troublesome, by reason of their bigness, and requiring over
great a Train: at present they use nothing but Cannon, therefore I shall only
speak here of this Machine, and only as much as shall be necessary for its well
mannagement at Sea, or perhaps sometimes to make a Descent or Landing; judging
it necessary not to omit this Treatise, since at present all the defense of a
Vessel depends on the Cannon, and that in the time of fight there are more
Shots made in one day at Sea, than in a Seige at land in two months.

The arming of a Gally is much different from that of a Ship or round Vessel,
as also the Equipage of Cannon at Sea differs from that at Land; at Sea the
Ordnance are mounted upon small Carriages, and upon four and sometimes two low
Wheels, without any Iron work. Each Gally carries ordinarily nine Pieces of
Ordnance in its Prow or Chase, of which the greatest, and that which delivers
his Shot just over the very Stem, and lies just in the middle, is called the
Corsiere, or Cannon of Course, or Chase Cannon, which in time of fight does the
most effectual Service, it carries generally a Shot of 33l or 34l weight, and
are generally very long Pieces; it recoils all along the middle of the Gally to
the Mast, where they place some soft substance to hinder its farther recoyl,
that it might not endammage the Mast. Next to this Corsiere are placed two
Minions on each side, which carries a 5 or 6 pound Ball; and next to these are
the Petrieroes, which are loaded with Stone-shot to shoot near at hand.
Thirdly, there are some small Pieces, which are open at the breech, and called
Petrieroes a Braga, and are charged with a moveable Chamber loaded with base
and bar-shot, to murder near at hand. And the furthest from the Corsiere or
Chase-Cannon are the Harquebuss a croc, which are charged with small Cross-bar
shot, to cut Sails and Rigging. All these small Pieces are mounted on strong
pins of Irons having Rings, in which are placed the Trunnions with a Socket, so
that they are easily turned to any quarter.

In Ships or round Vessels are sometimes mounted 200 Pieces of Ordnance,
although at present, experience shows that 100 are sufficient for the greatest
Ships, Carraques or Gallions, it being impossible to have a greater number,
giving a just distance betwixt each Cannon, that there may be room for men to
ply the Guns, and that the fire of one may not endanger to give fire to the
other.

All the Guns are mounted upon Wheels and Carriages; moreover the Petrieroes,
which are planted in the Forecastle and Quarter to defend the Prow and Stern,
are mounted upon strong Pins of Iron without any Reverse; the greatest Pieces
of Battery are planted the lowest, just above the surface of the water, the
smallest in the Wast and Steerage, and with the Petrieroes in Quarter Deck and
Forecastle. Upon the Sea, to load great Ordnance they never load with a Ladle,
but make use of Cartridges, as well for Expedition as Security in not firing
the Powder, which in time of fight is in a continual motion.

The Qualifications of him who takes the charge of the Cannon of a Ship.
THe Gunner, whom they call in the Straights Captain, Master-Canoneer, and in
Bretagne and Spain and in other places Connestable, is one of the principal
Officers in the Ship; it is he alone with the Captain who can command the
Gunners. He ought to be a man of courage, experience, and vigilant, who knows
the goodness of a Piece of Ordnance, the force of Powder, and who also knows to
mount a Piece of Ordnance upon its Carriage, and to furnish it with Bolts,
Plates, Hooks, Capsquares, Axle-trees, and Trucks, and that may not reverse too
much; to order well its Cordage as Breeching and Tackling; to plant the Cannon
to purpose in the middle of its Port; to know how to unclow it, make ready his
Cartridges, and to have them ready to pass from hand to hand through the
Hatches, and to employ his most careful men in that affair; that he have care
of all, that he be ready every where to assist where necessity shall be; and
take care that all be made to purpose.

He and his Companions ought with their dark Lanthornes continually to see if
the Guns play, and if the Rings in Ships do not shake.

If there be necessity of more Cordage, and to see that the Beds and Coins be
firm and in good order; when the Ship comes to Anchor, he furnishes Cordage,
and takes care that all his Companions take their turn and quarters, that
continually every evening they renew their priming Powder, and all are obliged
to visit their Cannon Powder every eight days, to see if it has not received
wet, although they be well stopped a top with Cork and Tallow; to see that the
Powder-room be kept neat and clean, and the Cartridges ranged in good order,
each nature or Calibre by it self, and marked above in great Letters the weight
of the Powder and nature of the Piece to which it belongs, and to put the same
mark over the Porthole of the Piece; that the Linstocks be ready, and furnished
with Match, and to have always one lighted, and where the Cannoneer makes his
Quarter to have two one above another below; that his Grenades and Firepots be
in readiness, and 3 or 400 Cartridges ready filled, Extrees and Trucks, to turn
often over the Powder-barrels, that the Powder do not spoil; to have a care of
Rings and of the Ports, that they have their Pins and small Rings.

Although every man ought to be a man well approved and experienced in all
these things, before he can be trusted with the charge of a Vessel, which
depends in time of fight more upon him than any other; nevertheless those
whoaspire to the charge of a Master Cannoneer, ought to have the Theorick and
Practick part joined together, as well to practice themselves, as to instruct
and correct the faults of their Undergunners, and moreover to teach them all
sorts of Fireworks, which may serve as occasion shall require. The Sub-gunners
and Matrosses ought to be so many, that each may have no more than two Guns to
his charge. And for as much as one finds at Sea very few persons who understand
all that I intend to speak of, and those who understand very often cannot
inform, or else will not take the pains to instruct their Companions, and the
Matrosse, who serve under them, therefore I will prolong this following
Chapter, of that which I have in general touched here.

At Sea they never use the Ladle but Cartridges, of Canvas or Parchment, to
which they give three Calibres in breadth, and four in length, and two half
Calibres for the lying, in case there is no Scrole; and before they put the
Cartridge into the Chase, they open that end toward the Touchhole with a
Knife or Priming Iron upon that part which corresponds to the Touchhole. If
the Cartridge is well made there is no need of ramming it after the Charge.

If with a Cannon or Pierrier you would shoot a Bullet red hot, before you put
it into the Chase betwixt the Powder, in stead of Hay or Wadding you must put a
Sod of Earth, and sponge well the Cannon.

To lay a Piece of Ordance to pass at Sea.
TO point a Piece of Ordnance, or lay a Piece to pass, is to level it directly
against the Mark you intend to strike.

The practice whereof which they use at Sea, is different from that of the
Batteries at Land. For at Sea all the exactness of Shot depends upon the motion
of the Ship; when you give fire, the Heaving of the Ship, and setting of the
Waves, are ordinarily so unconstant, that if the Cannoneer does not well
observe his time, he misseth his Aim, and loses his Shor, and which depends
wholly upon his judgment, having no other way to guide himself then this, which
is so well to take time, that he expect and see that part the most elevated and
raised up upon the water which he intends to strike, that it may not be covered
and under water at such time as the Powder takes fire, and chaseth the Ball,
which may happen in several manners, to wit, If we give fire when one of the
Vessels engaging or engaged sinketh it self into the hollow of the Waves, then
when that from whence you intend to shoot abaseth or raises its Deck on which
is your Battery, your Piece then losing its Horizontal Line, or when the Waves
which are betwixt the Enemies Ships swell up and cover your Battery, Judgment
only and Experience can put this Advice into practice. Those that will
apprehend, must first know the thickness of the Metal at the Touchhole, and
from thence judge the time that the Powder may be a firing to the Chamber.
Secondly, they must well advise themselves of the distance of moving of the
Object against which they aim, which ought to be no farther distant than 1000
common Paces or more, and then they level the Piece about 20 Paces before, in
which time the Vessel overtakes the determinated distance, in the mean time
that the Powder in the Touchole burns, and that the Shot slies. Thirdly, they
must diligently observe the roling and motion of the Vessel, according to which
they make trial of their Judgment.

An Appendix of Artificial Fireworks for War and Delight; by Sir Abriham Dager
Knight. Ingeniere.
First of an Artificial Mortar made of Wood, Canvas and Paste-board.
I shall not make mention here of any Metal Mortars, since they are plainly
treated of in the fore part of this book, but only show you how to make an
artificial Mortar: you must get a Rouler A. of 8 inches in diameter, and 21 in
length, then get a foot B. turn for the Brith of the said Mortar, of the same
diameter as the Rouler, observing that the Lead D B E be of 13 inches in
diameter, and 5 in the thickness B; then make a hole or Chamber in the Brith
for the Powder, having 2 inches in diameter and three in depth, them two pieces
must be joined together by the ends as it is represented, and after you have
well rubbed your long Rouler with Tallow for fear the Glue should stick upon
it, roll upon the same foam Canvas or Cotton Cloth, and Past-bord well wetted
all over with Glue, the thickness of 2 inches or 2 1/^, then let it dry being
well fastened round about with Cord wetted in Glue; and having pulled out the
Rouler, and droven some nails of 4 inches long in the foot to join them
together, as you may see by FD'BE, then make a hole for the fuse, and get a
foot of wood 24 inches square, 10 inches thick, and 7 in depth, where you shall
set your Mortar upon its Brith in order to its operation.

The Use of the Mortar.
This kind of Mortar is good to throw Grenades, Fireballs or Stones over
Walls or into a Garrison; and to hinder the Enemies works, as Trench,
Batteries, etc.

This Mortar (as the others) rises to any degree of the compass as you please,
from 40 degrees to 45, and from 45 to 90 degrees. After your Mortar is charged,
set fire to the fusee of the Granado, Fireballs, or Balloons, then to the
Mortar, and observe where your Granado falls, and according correct your faults
the following Shots.

Fireballs of Canvas.
TAke a round cloth ball filled with Sand, of such bigness as you desire make
your Fireballs, upon which you shall shape your Canvas, and after it is
finished, you shall let out the Sand and take out the Linen ball; after which,
you shall sow it up, and fill it with this following Composition.

Take Saltpeter, Powder, Sulphur, of each equal quantity well pounded, and mixed
together with as much Linseed Oil as to make it in a kind of a Paste, which
will be to fill your Balls.

Another Sort.
Take Saltpeter, Powder, Sulphur, Camphire and Borax, all well pounded in a
Mortar with oil of Piter, and dissolve in black Pitch, Wax, Colophone, and
Mutton tallow, all these things must be well boiled together; then make up your
Balls, and cover them with Tow, having made two holes with a Bodkin cross-ways,
which you shall fill with prime of a slow composition, that they may have time
to take fire: they are good to stick and set any thing on fire, and other
things necessary.

Another.
Take one part of Powder, one of Saltpeter refined, one of Sulphur refined,
Rosin, Burgundy Pitch, Vernish in grain, Salt Armoniack, add to every pound 4
ounces of Camphire, and as much Linseed oil or Wallnut, and mix it together;
note to warm your oil a little before you mix it together, then make up your
Balls.

For the Petard.
THe best are made of Copper with the 10th. part of Brass, (though many are
made of Iron) they must be 12 inches long, the Diameter near the Brith 7: and
in the mouth 10 inches. Fig. R.

After the Chamber is filled with Powder, you must stop the hole with a round
piece of Lether I, and afterward with a wooden one L, that must go strait in,
and after fill the rest with yellow Wax or Pitch covered over with a Cere
cloth, then tie him upon his Madrier M, thus fastened at the door of the
Fortress N, his fuse being full of a slow composition, that the man fixing it
may have time to withdraw, having tied 2 screws (that must fasten him at the
door) to the two corners of the said Petard, and to carry and keep him up; you
must set him upon the Chariot O, having 2 sharp iron points to enter in, and
strong enough to bear the said Petard, and a man whilst he makes it fast at
the said Door. See Fig. O and N.

Of the Fuse for Bombes.
THey must be of a slow composition, to give time enough to throw either
Bombes, Grenades, Fireballs, Thundering Barrels, etc They are made thus; take
a pound of Powder, four ounces of Saltpeter, one ounce of Sulphur well beaten,
dry, and sifted separately; then mix it, and make up your fuse of it.

Another.
Take Powder of Benjamin, and small Coals all well beaten and mixed together,
with some oil of Piter, then use it.

How to make Fire Pots. Fig. P.
TAke a Granado charged as they are usually, only without a fuse, then put it
in an Earthen Pot, filled with fine Powder, and cover with Leather, having 2
Matches cross ways lighted, with a handle of cord to throw it more easily; when
it falls, the Pot will break, and the matches set the Powder on fire; the
Granado will have its effect.

How to set fire to any place.
YOu must have Bullets that holds 4 or 5 pounds of Powder, and after they are
well stopped, tie to it some Matches lighted, and they will set on fire any
place, wherever they break.

How to make a Light.
TAke little Faggots made of small dry rods, dipped in black Pitch, new Wax and
Colophone melted together; they are good to set fire to Galerys, Palisadoes,
etc. and to lighten.

Of Thundering Barrels. Fig. S.
THese Barrels are of a great use to throw in at a Breach, or tumble in the
Enemies Lodgements; for being of a combustible matter, they will set fire at
any thing that they use to shelter themselves; they are made several ways, some
as ordinary Barrels and half Barrels, filled up with Tow, dipped in some
Colophone, Turpentine, Pitch, Oil of Piter, or any thing combustible, with
Grenades, Fire pots, Pistol barrels laden with Bullets, and set so that they
may not fire all at once, but scatter round about them.

Of Thundering Bullets.
THey are made of the following composition, in which the Grenades and Pistol
Barrels laden with Bullets, are set in order with whole Gunpowder betwixt
each; and to hinder their firing all at once, you must put between them some
Tow dipped and mixed in the following composition; 4 parts Turpentine, 2 of
Powder, 2 of Small coals well sifted, 3 of Poyligui, one of Rosin, one of
Camphire, of stinking Benjamin, and of Colophone, well mixed all together, and
put into your Bullets, as it is said before, not forgetting to bore in it 2 or
3 holes filled with prime of a slow composition, which must be lighted before
you put it in the Mortar: this Bullet will make a wonderful effect where it
falls.

Of Artificial Fireworks useful both by Land and Sea.
FIrst of all of fire Lances, some are made four and five foot long, some of 3,
and some of less, having a Belly near to the iron, which you shall fill with
the following composition. Take some Tow dipped in a pound of new Wax and equal
quantity of Turpentine, of Powder, as much Sulphur, 2/4 of black Pitch, all
this well melted in oil of Piter; these great Lances are good to set fire to a
ship, the others are thrown with the hand, and the least are shot out of a Bow
to set the Sails on fire, to defend a Breach, or to set any things on fire.
Fig. T.

How to Contrive Artificial Fire Pikes. Fig. V.
THey are good to defend the approach of an Enemies Ship, their lengths must be
from 12 to 15 Foot long, having a belly near the end filled with the following
composition; one part Saltpeter, as much Turpentine, the same quantity of Bay
salt, 20 parts of Powder well pounded, 3 of Colophone, 7 of Arsnick, of Pitch,
one part of Linseed Oil, one of Sulphur, mixed all together with some Linseed
Oil and Tallow; then make up your work about 3 inches long and one and an half
thick.

How to prepare your Cotton for Prime.
TAke some Cotton Thread and double it 4 or 5 times, if you intend it for to
prime your stars, but if you intend it for your Lances or Rockets it must be 8
or 10 doubles, then wet it well in clean water, then take powder well beaten,
and clear water, and make a Paste, and having squeesed the water out of the
Cotton, dip it very well in the said Paste, then take it out, and roll it well
in dry powder dust, and set up to dry, for your use.

Of Artificial Fireworks for delight.
THese Fires are divided into three parts, first them that fly in the air;
2dly. Them upon the ground; and 3dly, Them that swim upon the waters.

And every of these parts is divided also into three parts; the first and most
royal for the air are the Balloons, the 2d. are the Rockets, and the 3d. the
flying Saucissons.

Them upon the Earth are also divided into three parts; 1st. are the Rockets,
2d. Fire Lances, 3d. the Saucissons.

Them for the Waters are also three sorts; 1st. the Globes or Balloons, 2d, the
double Rockets, and 3d. the single Rockets; but before we speak of their
contrivances, I shall treat a little of their Moulds and Tools.

Of the Proportions for the Moulds of Sky Rockets.
IF the Mould has one inch in the mouth, it must have six in length, and the
Rowler for the Coffin of an inch in Diameter, but the Rammers D must be a
little less, to go easily in the Coffin, having a hole bored just in the middle
for the Broach C, the foot where it is fast must enter in the Mould one inch
and an half, the Broach must be 3 Lignes thick, and 3 inches long; if you
desire a bigger mould, you must observe the proportions according to this Rule.

A is the mould, B the Rowler, F the Bodkin to bore the Rockets and Stars, G
the Coffin.

The Mould for ground Rockets.
HIs mould must have an inch diameter in the mouth, and 5 in length, the Rouler
for the Coffin 4 Lignes in diameter, which makes of half an inch, and the
Rammer a little less; the Broach must be of an inch long, the Brith going into
the mould half an inch.

Of the Mould for Water Rockets.
IF the mouth be one inch in diameter, the length must be 8 inches, the brith
or foot going in the Mould one inch, but without Broach; the Rouler must have
of an inch in Diameter, and the Rammer a little less.

The Composition for Sky Rockets.
IF you desire to have your Rockets mount up with impetuosity, take only your
great Canon Powder well pounded and sifted, and charge your Rockets as it is
said hereafter.

Another.
Take a pound of your great Canon Powder well sifted, add to it two ounces of
small coal dust well sifted and mixed together; but before you finish your
Rockets try one, and if your composition is too weak, add some powder, if too
strong, some coal dust, and for want of Willow Coals, you may use of wine ashes
or sea-coals.

How to charge your Rockets.
FIrst you must take care not to put too much composition at a time, but about
a Spoonful at once, giving every time three or four good blows, with a hammer
of a pound weight, continuing so till your Coffin is full to the Moulds mouth,
or very near, then thrust hard upon it some paper doubled several times, or
else a round piece of Paste-board bored three or four times with a Bodkin to
give fire to your Stars, Serpents, or Saucisons, then cut the remainder of the
Coffin as close as you can, and cover the rest with Paper well glued.

The Composition for the Ground Rockets.
TAke some Gunpowder without any mixture, well sifted, and fill your Rocket
with it (as it is said before) within an inch of the Moulds mouth, then thrust
in hard a piece of Paste-board or double Paper, bore in it some holes with the
Bodkin, and then put in it a good Pistol charge of whole Gunpowder, and having
doubled some Paper of the Coffin upon the said powder, choke the rest very
well, and cut what remains.

Of the Composition for Water Rockets.
TO make her appear with a great Tail, take Saltpeter one pound, Powder half a
pound, Sulphur half a pound, Coal dust, two ounces, all well sifted and mixed
together, and fill up your Rockets the same manner as the other; and having put
a Saucisson at the end, cover it with Paper, and cover the Rocket all over with
black Pitch and Rosin, to make it swim, and hinder the water from spoiling it:
then tie to it a little Willow Rod of about two foot long, and if you desire to
make them leap in and out of the water, you must put, in charging the said
Rocket between every two fingers breadth of the composition of an inch of fine
Powder well sifted.

How to make Serpents. Fig. 1.
TAke a Rouler a little bigger then a Goose quill, and roll some Paper upon it,
eight or ten times, making your Coffin of about four inches long, then choke it
near the middle, leaving a little light to communiguate the fire then fill part
with composition, and the shortest with whole Gunpowder; then choke both ends,
the end toward the Powder quite up, and the other with a little hole for the
prime. The composition for Ground Rocket is the best for Serpents, the other
composition for Sky Rockets being not so brisk, nevertheless both will do good
effect, and leap about very prettily.

How to make Gold Rain. Fig. 2.
TAke a quantity of Goose quills, cut the hollow end as long as you can, and
fill them a little hard with the composition for Sky Rockets; then prime them
with wet Powder, and keep them for your use.

How to make Silver Rain.
TAke one part Camphire, 8 of Powder, 12 of Sulphur, 24 of Saltpeter, well
beaten together, wetting the Pestle with oil of Almonds; then fill your quills
as before, taking care that the air do not spoil it.

There are several sorts of Stars, the red ones are made as follows.
TAke a pound of Saltpeter, of a pound of Sulphur, of a pound of Powder, all
well sifted and mixed together; then roll that composition in Linen or Paper
about the bigness of a Nutmeg, making a hole through with a Bodkin, to prime it
with the prepared Cotton. See 3, 4, 5, 6.

Another.
Take a pound of Saltpeter, pound of Sulphur, pound of Powder, all well sifted
and mixed together, then take some Linseed Oil, or clear water, and make a hard
paste made up in little Balls, roll them in Powder dust whilst they are wet,
and after they be dried, they are fit for your use.

Another of Blew and Red.
TAke Saltpeter 4 ounces, Sulphur, 2 ounces, Meal 8 ounces, Powder 2 ounces,
all well sifted and mixed together with oil of Spike.

Another of White.
TAke Powder eight ounces, Saltpeter 24, Sulphur 12, Camphire one, beaten well
together with Oil of Almonds, and keep it close for fear of taking air.

Another White one that lasts long.
Take Powder 4 ounces, Saltpeter 16, Sulphur 8, Camphire one, Oil of Piter 2.

For Fire Lances.
THe Coffin must be as the others, of such bigness and length as you desire,
then fill it with the composition for red Stars, the lower end must be stopped
with a piece of wood of about two inches to nail them fast, and the upper end
prime with wet powder.

How to make the Balloons. Fig. 7.
YOu must get a Rouler turned of such bigness as you desire to make the Moulds
of the Balloons, then roll upon it some Paste-board, not sparing the glue to
make it fast; and having made your great Coffin, you must choke it at one end,
and fill it with Saucissons, Serpents, Stars, etc. in good order, and well
prime that when the Powder Chamber at the bottom takes fire, and breaks the
Balloons, they may all take fire at once, then choke the other end, leaving a
hole big enough for a fusse, that you shall glue to it, filled with composition
able to light the prime, and make the Balloon to play with order and effect.

How to make Fire Wheels. Fig. 8.
TAke a Wheel of bigness according as you intend to make your fire, and having
put your Rockets in order, so that when one ends, it may give fire to the next,
and so continue.
