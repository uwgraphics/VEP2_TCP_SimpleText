The IRISH COLORS DISPLAYED, In a REPLY of an English Protestant to a late
LETTER of an Irish Roman Catholic.
Both addressed to his Grace The DUKE of ORMOND Lord Lieutenant of His
Majesty's Kingdom of IRELAND.
Similis in prole resurgo.
MY LORD,
IT was yesterday my chance to meet a Letter newly printed, though pretended by
the Title to have been given your Grace about the end of October 1660.
[desiring a just and merciful regard of the Roman Catholics of Ireland]
wherein though I confess much is spoken and little said, yet because the
Author of it seems to have been both a bold man in setting your Graces name to
it, and a wise man in not setting his own, I thought it fit to be taken notice
of, and shall follow his example in both, though (I fear) neither that nor his
precepts in any thing else.

The contention lying (as it ever has done, and I fear ever will,) between His
Majesty's British Protestant Subjects, and His Irish Roman Catholic in the
Kingdom of Ireland, I imagined it would become us ill, who never refused to
fight them in the Field upon the extremest disadvantage, if we should now avoid
to do it in the Press upon the greatest advantages, that the justice of our
Case, the mercy of our King, your Graces patronage, and the favor of Heaven
expressed in all these circumstances can allow us; and therefore since they
have drawn so much of our blood, I shall never grudge them a little of our ink,
being I confess well enough pleased to see us both now at length putting on the
same color, whereas for so long together the Black has been ours, and the
Crimson theirs.

The matter of this Pamplet is indeed so difficult to find, and so easy to
answer, that I am a little loath to begin the search, being much of the same
nature with that of a Brass penny in a heap of Rubbish, that before you find it
almost puts out your eyes, and after you have it, it is hardly felt in your
hand; and therefore before I quest after that little game it affords me, I
shall give your Grace some account of a word or a fear, which just now fell
from me, that the contention between the two Parties in Ireland will never have
an end, which may both startle your Grace with the difficulty of your Charge,
whose chief end and task is to disprove this opinion; and shock many others as
an uncharitable thought, who are apt to believe the quiet of that Country; may
be wrought out by tempering of Interests, extinguishing Feuds, by inducing a
general Oblivion of the past and security of future Times; and in a word, that
a Golden Age may arise in that Kingdom, out of one of Iron that has lasted
some hundreds of years, just as a fair and gentle morning does sometimes at Sea
after a long furious storm, without any reason for one or for the other, but
only, that a general composure of minds happens at times like a calm set of
weather; and no man the wiser though all men the happier for it.

My Lord, I wish I could be of this Belief, I confess I am not, though I may
justly say my temper and fortune both dispose me to it, the one giving me fear
of losing a little, and the other despair of gaining the least by tumults and
wars. I have long accounted the Peace of my Country to be like the Health of
my Body; without which all that men call pleasures turn sour, or lose all
their relish at least. I will not say to make good my opinion, that Saturn,
Mars, and Mercury are the only Planets that influence that Climate, though the
sullen and angry genius, as well as the cunning, busy, chaffering vein of the
inhabitants might help me out, nor that the kindly rays of Venus and Jupiter
are too gentle to pierce a thick air that is accused so often to obscure the
Sun, and fully the Moon among them; but I must needs say, when I consider the
rise of these two parties in that Kingdom, which was the descent of our
victorious Ancestors among them, who at first held their Lands from their
Swords, though our Kings title to the whole was afterward strengthened by
Alliances, by submissions as well as (if they please to take notice of it) by
an absolute grant of that whole Island from Pope Adrian the fourth to Henry the
second.

When I consider that upon this original quarrel the Natives of the Country
have ever since locked upon the English name, as that of Usurpers and Intruders
upon their lands and inheritance, and the English planted there, upon the
Irish; as enemies, for so they were styled in all public Acts for a long
course of time.

When I consider that these two parties have for above four hundred years,
been bred up, as I may say in mutual slaughters, and rapines, and wars, every
age, begun by the Irish, upon pretenses of recovering their Liberty and
Country, and returned by the English, in defense of their King, their Kindred,
and the Lands they had purchased by their Ancestors blood, or by their own
Treasure.

When I consider that these bloody animosities were constant and hereditary to
them, so long before any division between them in matters of Religion, and
withal how much they have been sharpened by that accident, which has been so
powerful as most unhappily to engrafft such numbers of old English families
into the Irish stock and interest upon this last Rebellion (for to that we must
needs attribute it rather than to their long habitudes among them.)

When I consider how much of the Irish lands have been given in a lump into the
hands of British Planters upon forfeitures in King James his time, what
quantities must now be disposed of, though the greatest tenderness imaginable
should be used in the adjudging their new forfeitures now in question, besides
how perpetual a memory the Irish retain of these esteemed injurys, as I could
give instances to amazement, and as several of their Articles in forty eight
in some measure discover by their returning so far back and resolutions even in
cold blood to unravel the settlements of ages past.

When I consider that similitude of customs and manners is the common sodder
of all Friendships and good Intelligences among men, and withal how strange a
difference in both these as well as habit and language is between these two
Nations, unless it be where by long abode of few among many, either the
civility of the English has corrected theirs, or the barbarousnesse of the
Irish has infected ours.

When I consider among many others of the kind, that one old custom of theirs,
in celebrating their funerals after their savage manner, where the praises of
the dead use to be raised and rehearsed, from no other virtue or prowess then
the number of English slain or murtherd by him or his Ancestors, either as
Soldiers in War, or as Woodkernes or Tories in Peace, which is elegantly
described by Spencer in his short discourse of Ireland, and I have been assured
is still used in many of the wilder parts in the North, where upon such
occasions they have no witnesses but themselves.

When I consider the common conversation of the Vulgar of both parties upon all
the least occasions breaking out into terms of malice, suspicion, revenge, and
contempt, besides the strange ignorance of the common Irish that subjects the
whole conduct of their lives to the guidance of their Priests and Friars, which
makes them all Spanish Papists, as the common term goes, and as I think indeed
all Roman Catholics living in Protestant Dominions throughout Europe are in
great degree; and to this only I can attribute that senseless opinion among
the Vulgar Irish, that the Kingdom of Ireland lawfully belongs to the Crown of
Spain, and that his Majesty's Title to it is like that of the English to their
Lands by usurpation and force.

When I consider that, upon this present conjuncture, though his Majesty has
been pleased to exempt many of the Roman Catholic Nobles and Gentlemen from
the stain and punishment of their common original guilt in the last bloody
Rebellion, by restoring them fully to their honors and estates, upon the
amends they seem to have made by their personal services to his Majesty
abroad, yet not a man of them is content to save his own stake to break from
the herd, or leave stickling in the patronage and defense of the common party,
as if they valued not their estates without their dependances, and had
something more in aim then what they pretend to in their ordinary clamors and
complaints; This I confess is the only thing which lessens many of them in my
value, whom otherwise I should esteem very much as persons of good breeding,
good meene, good wits, and good humor, and fit for the eye and for the service
of their Prince.

And lastly, when I consider that all this cannot be attributed to the force of
any constellation above, or conjunction here below, but rather to the common
course of humane nature, and the passions incident thereunto, and that this
implacable enmity of the Irish to the English, springs from the same root with
that of all other subjected people to their Conquerors, till by time and
prevailing number, weariness of mutual fears, policy of Laws and Governors
both come at length to be blended into one Mass. That consequently the late
unparalled Massacres, though far greater in number then any upon record of
Story, yet had no newer cause or occasion then that of the Roman Citizens in
the lesser Asia, that of the French in Scicily, that of the Danes in England,
and the frequent ones of Europaean Colonies in the Indies; till time and
experience taught them to provide for their safety and so they have done, My
Lord, all wiser Nations to secure their conquests, though it has ever yet been
the reproach of the English Government, that in so long a tract of time they
have never been able to free themselves from a vast expense of Blood and
Treasure upon an Island which seems by nature to have been intended so much for
the greatness of His Majesty's Imperial Crown, by the mighty access of those
two great strengths, Money and able bodies of men, arising from the incredible
fertility of the soil in all rich native Commodities, as well as the increase of
people; When all these thoughts I say run thorough my head, I cannot hope to
live so long as to hear [Iam cuncti gens una sumus] played by the Irish Harp,
though I know it was sung by some English in their discourses about the
beginning of the late Kings Reign, but never I think by any Irish, and with how
sad Notes it then ended in the Close some men I hope may still have leave to
remember.

Now My Lord, if all this be but vision and false imagery, raised up only by my
own spleen or passions, I may possibly pass for a Fanatique, or some malicious
envious person, none of which I thank God I have yet ever done nor I hope ever
shall upon any other score. For I have often deplored that my birth or my
fotunes should cast me into an Age or a Country, where men cannot live
together more like the Sons of one Father, the Subjects of one Prince, the
Servants of one God, then I see we are like to do. But if it be a true
representation of the Quarrel in that Kingdom, of the disposition of the
parties, and complexion of the Climate; then I think it will concern his
Majesty to secure his Crown and his Subjects peace in that Kingdom, by the
same arts of Government that have been used in the same cases, with respect to
such differences as circumstances may make, and whatever become of lands never
trust our lives again in the power of a generation whose game and prey they
have been, and whose design they must ever be unless my Almanac fails, It Is
but a careless and will be but an unfortunate Shepherd that quits his guard
and suspicion, and neglects his flock because the old wolf has broke his teeth,
though he can never lose his nature nor yet break the Law of [Similis in prole
resurgo.]

What those arts of Government are, I shall not in the least presume to
discourse of, all Stories and all Times are full of them, and the Observations
upon them very instructing, and no person able to make better use of them, and
to improve them more than your Grace under His Majesty's favorable influence,
and in concurrence with so great, so wise, and so renowned a Councellor to his
Majesty and friend to your Grace as My Lord High Chancellor of England, whose
justice and favor to us we must ever own, and shall endeavor to acknowledge,
with that devotion becomes us as true servants both of his virtues and fortunes.

Besides, my opinions in this point I confess may be a little out of the
common way, and I am so too in not being the least fond of giving them light
without a direct occasion, and therefore shall make no inquiry here into the
usual ways of securing acquisitions either by out numbering the Natives, by
introducing conformity of Laws, Language, Habit, Custom, Religion, by
interchangeable removal of their seats, as in Charlemain's time, of Saxons
into Flanders, and of Flemish into Saxony, by assuming their lands and giving
them a new dependancy, by entertaining feuds between themselves, by Forts and
standing Armies according to the modern policy, or by distinct Colony's
according to that of the old Grecian and Roman States, I should only beg if my
prayers were of any regard, that his Majesty might but esteem this a matter
worthy His care and thought, and then I should no way doubt of the success;
and that you may judge it so the more, I shall only be your remembrancer that
as the only good effect of such infinite slaughters and Murders as have
hitherto infam'd that Kingdom, and discouraged the plantation, has been the
producing of this conjuncture wherein His Majesty has gained an occasion of
settling it upon lasting foundations which has been so much desired by his
Ancestors, but the like never attained either in respect of power, justice, or
honor. So whatever mischeifs or miscarriages shall ever happen in that
Kingdom in times to come, will by posterity be laid to the charge of this
generation, but how to be answered I believe the next must tell.

Now My Lord, how great a part of this care and conduct must needs fall to your
Graces share, I shall not need put you in mind, finding one among your Titles
that sufficiently does it, but in case you fall into the same opinion I
profess to be of, that the peace and safety of that Kingdom cannot be
provided for by balancing interests between English and Irish, but by boying up
one or other of them out of danger of sinking again, I shall then offer to your
thoughts, whether as Duke of Ormond as well as His Majesty's Lieutenant of
Ireland, both your duty and your interest does not evidently lead you to the
support, protection, and encouragement of the English who in that Kingdom will
come under your charge.

And here I must begin to take notice of our Secretary and his Letter, the
Scribbling of which gave me the occasion of mine, the greatest design of the
whole draught seems by cogging and clawing, by professions of kindness and
confidence, by terms of relation and good intelligence, to endear their cause
and persons to your Grace, and to work upon your affections where they despair
to do it upon your judgment. He says they have been [your constant beleivers,
your passionate Sticklers, their hopes of delivery have been by you, begs a
demonstration of that justice and favor you intended them in forty eight,
threatens your failing will lessen your esteem and dependencies among them, and
at last compares you to Joseph, and calls you the Savior of your brethren] on
purpose sure to put you in mind how your brethren sold and betrayed you, for
how the Irish came to be your brethren upon any other kindred I cannot imagine.

On the other side, My Lord, we are bold to claim and challenge you for ours,
and upon many good tokens, by the birth of your Ancestors and your own, by
their and your unshaken loyalty to the Crown of England, by your constancy to
the old Protestant Religion, by your personal commands against the Irish, and
glorious victories over them the first two years of the Rebellion, and which no
question had continued had not your Royal Masters affairs at that time
received a change there, by the fatal necessity of his others in England, and
forced you to a conjunction, where you had ever before been at defiance. If I
may descend to lighter circumstances, we challenge you for ours by your
breeding, by your person by your speech, by your disposition, by your Lady and
your Children, in the midst of all which who ever should see you, let him be
never so much a stranger to all our disputes, I durst trust him to judge
whether you are English or Irish, and dur'st dye for it, if one man in a
hundred that was not stark blind would ever give you from us.

As for our affections to you, our confidence in you, our dependence upon you
in this occasion and upon all to come, we cannot give place to our adversaries,
as knowing our own hearts, and that it is well if any else knows theirs. If our
hopes or our trusts have ever been estranged from your Grace, it has been owing
to those unhappy revolutions that have forced you to a seeming good aspect upon
them, but now that the occasion and necessity of that is all blown over, we
return and throw our selves into your arms, with the same kindness and
confidence that Lovers would do into those of a Mistress whose forced or
feigned smiles to a rival, had for a while entertained them in sullen aching
jealousies, which serve to make way for a kinder reconcilement, And now My
Lord, deceive us if you can, no, we know you are too wise, too loyal, and too
generous.

Besides as to your personal interest, (for as for that of your Masters it is
too evident which way it must incline you) you are arrived in command, in
dependence, in estate to the height of what you can aim at in Ireland without
being too much envied and something feared, so that all the game that lies
before you ought in prudence to be pursued in England, by preserving His
Majesty's favor, gaining his Subjects affections, preferring your Children and
increasing your fortunes, in a place where they may lie for a record of your
honor and merit, and be both a testimony and a pawn of your Families Loyalty,
if in ages to come your posterity should grow too great, or meet with a more
suspicious Master then now you have the happiness to serve. And My Lord, I
need not tell you how much your countenance to the English in Ireland would
endear you to the Nation here, nor how much that might be estranged from you,
by your favor to the Irish. For believe me, My Lord, we have here in England
bled and paid too deep, and too often upon their occasion to be presently
friends, and the horridness of this last Rebellion, has too far reached Heaven
with it is cry, and stained the earth with it is color to be suddenly either
forgiven in Heaven or forgotten upon Earth.

The next thing I can observe in the letter I begun with, is a comparison it
insists upon, between the Roman Catholic Irish, and His Majesty's Protestant
Subjects in the three Kingdoms, [many thousand of whom were he says far more
hainously criminal, who have as little contributed or intended toward His
Majesty's Restoration as they.]

If any comparisons are odious they are those of men's vices and guilt, rather
then of their virtues and innocence, which makes me unwilling to pursue this
any further, yet I cannot but observe the offenses of the Irish sprung from a
more general quarrel, which was without comparison more generally infused
through the hearts of the people, pursued by far more bloody courses, and which
is remarkable began where other quarrels use to end, that is with slaughter
and fury, whereas all others swell first in expostulations and manifestoes,
ripen in threats, warning, and preparations, break at length in fair and open
arms. But this Irish Rebellion clasht out like a sudden storm of lightning and
thunder, defacing houses and fields, wasting Countries, destroying man and
beast, and giving an essay of what it meant in the end by the cold and
treacherous murders of so many thousand innocent souls in the first two
months, before men were enough themselves to know almost from whence their
danger came; which number increasing to that of above Two hundred Thousand in
the first two years, makes the Massacre unparalled, and excuses all cruelties
may have been returned by the English in the heat of the War. Whoever imagins a
Troop of Soldiers, among whom is hardly a man, but has lately lost a Wife, a
Brother, a Parent or a Child by the butcherly hands of inveterate enemies, will
not wonder to see them fierce in their assaults or furious in their executions.

For the horrid Murder of his late Majesty of blessed memory, which this
Writer would throw into the balance as a crime diffused thorough many
Thousands of the Protestant Subjects in the three Kingdoms, I look upon it as
a bold slander, and which is no more to be imputed to the Protestants here,
then the assassin of Henry the fourth of France, to the Roman Catholics
there, this having been contrived by Ravilliack, and perhaps half a dozen
Jesuits his accomplices, and that by Cromwell, Ireton, and perhaps half a dozen
more, whose power, and name, and artifices, had at that time stunned the Nation
into a sufferance of that impious fact, and enchanted the Army into an outward
compliance with what I am confident not one man in Ten Thousand throughout the
three Kingdoms but abhorred in his Soul.

For what he says of [their having as little contributed or intended toward
the Kings restoration as the Irish did] because it is modestly spoken he shall
even go away with it, though no man I am sure, no not the Birds nor the Flies
contributed less to it then the Roman Catholic Irish, whereas there seemed
an universal conspiration toward it in the Protestants of the three Kingdoms,
which past for some amends of their faults, and earnest of their pardons so
graciously allowed them. And for their bare intentions they may best judge
themselves, for by their former actions we should be apt to judge ill, and
besides I have heard an unlucky Proverb, that hell is full of good intentions.

But we plead not our innocence neither here nor in Ireland, we stand not upon
Articles, we claim His Majesty's Grace held forth in the Act of Indemnity, and
question not but the same reasons which then induced His Majesty both to grant
it us and deny it them, continue still, and will do so to both our Posterities,
unless we lose our memories, and change our Religions, we grow to own
dependence upon the Pope, and they upon the King in all Ecclesiastical matters,
which, say what men will, draw Civil after them.

The next thing pleaded in this Letter is that [they fought for His Majesty
till overpowered by Multitudes, through Gods unsearchable judgments,
desertion by friends abroad, and home divisions, they lost both themselves and
their Country.] That they fought so long for the King, or were overpowered by
Multitudes, I cannot allow, for the Quarrel persu'd by the Long-Parliament, and
by the following Tyrannous power, against the Irish, was not for their Show of
adherence to the King, which was known to be the next Covert they shrunk under
for shelter, but it was for being Murderers and Rebels against the English
Nation and Government, and what advantages accrued to the Rebellious Arms in
England, from the pretense of this National War and revenge upon the Rebels of
Ireland, I need not enlarge; I may safely say, that as the miseries of these
Nations began to break out with violence and blood, first in that Kingdom, so
they were fomented and heightened all along by the ill effects and ill colors
of that Irish Rebellion.

Those who indeed so long and so bravely fought for His Majesty in Ireland, and
were so violently pursued by the Usurpers and their powers, we know well were
those gallant and Loyal Troops of English, assembled under your Graces command,
and made up either of the first English Army, or such constant Subjects to his
Majesty's interest in England, who after the Ruin of their hopes here, went
over into Ireland, preferring the hazard of their lives once more before the
Servitude of their Country: These are commonly comprehended under the name of
such as served His Majesty in the War of Ireland, before 49. and are a noble
vital part of that body, I mean by the English interest in Ireland; and how
well these were assisted and treated by the Roman Irish Catholics, I may
safely leave to your Graces Remembrance.

[The over-powering them with Multitudes,] I before never heard, nor can any
believe, who knows their numbers in proportion to ours much to the contrary; I
have heard and could tell, but that I love not to reproach men who have lost
their Arms, though cruelty and valor have been ever esteemed, and are indeed
by nature so little a kin, that whoever knows much of the one cannot believe
much of the other. For the rest of that Paragraph it is so ingenuous, I must
needs join with him in the acknowledgement [that through the unsearchable
Wisdom of God, desertion by friends abroad, and home divisions, they have lost
both themselves and their Country.]

For matter of their Articles in forty Eight, which the Writer of this Letter
presses to be observed that of Trasplantation, Corporations, and the disposal
of the Irish Lands according to His Majesty's declared Will, and the present
pursuit of His English Protestant Subjects, they are particulars I shall not
meddle with, as having heard that they all have, or will fall in debate before
His Majesty at Council, where your Lordship must needs be acquainted with all
that can be argued upon those Subjects, though in case I find need of more
public Satisfaction, I shall not refuse to come once more into the Press upon
that occasion, and question not to satisfy all unbias'd persons, concerning
His Majesty's Resolutions of settling the Kingdom of Ireland, upon the
foundation of a Protestant Strength and Interest, and make it evident he has
taken them up upon grounds of Piety, Justice, Prudence, and Honor, not out of
any [fear from the power of the English Army there as this Letter would
insinuate.] Whereas I am confident never any Prince was better served and
obeyed then His Majesty will be by His Protestant Subjects in Ireland, whom I
look upon all as one body.

Another shred of this Work I am taking in pieces, consists of some well
couched threatenings, [how much the hearts of the Roman Catholics in Ireland,
will be estranged both from His Majesty and your Grace] if they are defeated of
their hopes. I must agree with him again and acknowledge he tells you a great
truth, and that he might have told you another in saying they are so already,
past all means of firm reconciling, since they who aim at the whole, will never
be contented with a part. I shall only desire your Grace to take the warning
they give you; to trust and favor those who take themselves to be obliged by
you, never those who think themselves offended. Nor for ought I know will any
man blame them so much for seeking their revenge, as us for not providing our
defense, since in all like cases the same nature uses to imprint both the one
and the other.

All the rest of this Pamphlet consists in quotations of Scripture, from which
its Author [exhorts to imitation of God in not destroying the righteous with
the just, and denounces judgments against Breakers of Articles, from the
Example of Saul and the Gib^onites.] I shall not pursue the Parallel in those
cases between the Sins of Sodom and those of the Irish, nor between the
Scarcity of the Innocent in the one, and the other of these Nations; nor shall
I observe that the judgments of God were not sent down upon Israel, for making
the Gibeonites Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water, but as the Text runs for
Saul and his bloody House, because he slew the Gibeonites; in which case we
desire no Parallel, but should as earnestly intercede for the lives of the
Irish, though yet in that Case unpardoned, as we must always solicit for the
safety of our own, in such a Settlement as we hope to see achieved by His
Majesty's Gracious care, and your Lordships diligence in the execution of it.
For the rest I will not go about to answer him at this weapon (though it might
easily be done) as having I confess an aversion from the late custom of our
Age, for every private hand as it serves its one occasion, to draw all Stories
and expressions of Scripture into consequence, for the conduct of our lives and
the framing our opinions; I have observed this use to be of mischievous effect,
and destructive in a great measure to the respect and obedience we owe Civil
Authority. I revere the Scriptures, but esteem them given us for other use then
to fortify disputes concerning State Affairs out of every part of them, I know
how apt we are to be deceived with the likeness of Examples or Precepts, in
the unlikenesse of times and persons, and Laws and Manors, and Constitutions
and other Circumstances, therefore I shall here leave him to his devotions, and
betake my self to mine, a part of which are my hearty wishes and prayers, that
all His Majesty's Counsels may be guided with that Wisdom which will end in
his own Glory, and the Prosperity as well as Peace of all His Kingdoms, and
that your Graces conduct in this great Employment, may be as eminent as the
rest of your fortunes, and enlightened with a clear Sight of what is the true
interest both of His Majesty at present, the Crown of England in all Ages, and
your own too in the present Settlement and future Government of that unhappy
Kingdom; and because I both am, and desire to appear in Charity with all men,
I shall end my discourse as the Roman Catholic does his, with hearty wishes
that you may be in your Station [the Savior of your Brethren and your Country.]

For my self, what I am as to my temper and opinions, must be referred to this
Paper, who I am is no matter, if that speaks either sense or truth, or
successefully to the ends I intend it, which I am sure are fair and honest, as
well as the Professions sincere of my being

Your Graces most humble Servant.
