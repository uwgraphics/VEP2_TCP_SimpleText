A COPY OF A LETTER, Sent from a Person that was present at the Apprehension of
Mr. Meade and Five more.
SIR,
ON Sunday Night last, there were Apprehended upon Suspicion, Six Persons at
Bradwel juxta Mares (being a Town in the Hundreds of Essex) whereof the one is
Mr. Preston of Milend, a Grazier, the other Five were brought down by him in
Order to their Conveyance beyond Sea, to which purpose a Vessel was Hired from
Deal in Kent, to take them in at Bradwell, which accordingly came thither that
Night about Eleven or Twelve of the Clock, but was likewise Seized, together
with the Men. One of the Six is Mr. Meade of Stepney, a Nonconformist, who went
under the Name of Richardson, another owns his Name to be Bourne, and pretends
to be a Brewer in St. Giles's. Another of them is one Shrimpton, a
Linnen-Draper in London, as they Confessed upon their Examination before a
Justice, although they went under other Names before.

They are all found to Contradict one another in their several Examinations,
and accordingly were sent to Goal at Chelmsford on Monday last.

He that calls himself Bourne, has a Gold Watch, and a Gold Tobacco-Box, and
was richly Habited, though Disguised with an Old Coat, and is indeed one of the
most Complete Men I have seen.

They all Confessed (except Mr. Preston their Guide) that they intended either
for France or Holland, they cared not which, so they had got off from hence.

A little time will bring to Light the Hidden Works of Darkness, which is
heartily Prayed for, by

SIR Your Humble Servant E. M.

FINIS.
