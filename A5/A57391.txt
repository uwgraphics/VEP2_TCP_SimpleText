TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS IN THE High Court of PARLIAMENT
now assembled.
PArdon me Right Honorable, if amongst your other more serious present
affairs, I presume to dedicate to your acceptance and perusal this short
discourse of foreign Traffike: It has ever been accounted a branch of
Englands Royal Stem, and a commodity, that for many years, has brought a
wonderful Revenue to Englands Diadem; It now presses to your presence as an
agrieved weight, laden with many setters, imposed thereon by the covetousness
of some, and by the Envyers of our prosperous Traffike, yet seeing that like
religious Pilots you guide the helm of our Kingdom with your hand, whilst
your eyes are fixed on heaven, taking from thence the conduct of your earthly
directions, it hopes by that your good and gracious aspect to be now freed from
them all, and flourish again in its first luster. It is now about forty years
since it began to be ingrafted in our English Climat, and ever since found our
soil proper for i^s further grouth, but if it find not your Honors favorable
protection and future cherishing, a few years more may see it withr^d and
reduced to its first nothing, I dare not undertake in this discourse to
demonstrate the burdens that cloggeth it in this Kingdom, the several
Societies of incorporated Merchants of the City of London being called before
you, will best particularise ^he same, only I have labored to show, what may
best gain it in those parts of this Kingdom where it is wanting, and augment
that portion thereof in those places where it is settled already. Let not then,
Right Honorable, so excellent a Jem, and so hitherto profitable and eminent a
revenew, for want of a little of your help, die in your days, nor yet perish
in our age, but release it from those subtle Gives, that cunningly have been
intruded upon its liberties, and goes about to kill the root thereof, decking
it once again as primarily, with some of those lasting and beautiful
immunities that can and may make it live longer, and spread it self much
fairer, that the times to come may deservedly attribute to your names and
memory that splendour and glory it shall obtain by your benignity, so shall the
King, our gracious Soveraig^e, have just cause to commend your care for your
preserving to Himself and Kingdom, this so noble a Royalty, your Honors be
justly applauded for employing your industrious hands and heads in pruning, and
lopping the disordered branches of so excellent a graft, and the Merchants of
this Kingdom that have hitherto sown in Expectation, live in hope to reap a
fruitful crop of their foraigne adventures, and heartily pray for the good
success of all your other weighty affairs, and amongst the rest, so shall
ever ascend the devout Orisons of

Your Humble Servant L. R. Merchant of London.

To The READER.
COurteous Readers, It is needless for me here to tell you, how good a common
wealths man a Regular merchant is, nor yet trouble you in relating the several
benefits accr^^ing to a Kingdom, by his adventrous pains and in dustry, this
short discourse, though unpolished, if well considered, will I hope
sufficiently speak the one, and questionless make good the other. My
well-wishes to our Countries present Commerce, and the enlargement thereof, the
great need in the encouragement to the one, and the insensible ruin and decay
of the latter, was herein, and still is my greatest hope and object: I have
lately discerned that our industrious Neighbors were ready at a dear rate to
purchase that treasure by Traffike, which we our selves, by means of the
enviers of our Countries foraigne Trade, were ready to yield them gratis, and
as it were unsought, and for nothing; yet if it may be rightly said, as
undoubtedly it may be accounted, that Englands trade, is Englands treasure, why
should our gracious King and his people lose that so excellent a profit in a
moment, which cost his Merchants so many years to compass, and so many
hazards and charges to obtain and settle, a few privileges, and a little
protect on, a fair aspect, and a gentle encouragement, from both these
honorable assemblies, will quickly settle this Kingdoms Traffike, and not
only preserve it in its present splendor, but also easily augment and enlarge
it, w^i^h will add a wonderful honor to our Sovereigns Name, throughout the
World, and an eminent commodity and profit to the subjects of all his
Dominions, which every true subject I think does earnestly wish for, and every
honest Merchant does truly pray for, as does unfainedly,

Jews Roberts, Merchant, and Captain of the City of LONDON.

THE TREASURE OF TRAFFIKE.
THat we are not borne for our selves, is a saying no less ancient, then true:
the heathens as well as the Christians have held it a rule worthy to be
practiced, No Man is born for himself, but for his Country.
and every good man, of what quality and profession soever, that will give
evidence to the world of his fair intentions, for the benefit, either of the
public or private, are daily seen to follow and observe it.

The religious Divine, that with much labor and long study, having learned
himself the ways of Godliness, is daily noted to take care and pains, to
instruct others therein: the valiant sould^er that wears hi sword to d^fend
himself, yet is ever ready to draw the same in defense of his Country; the
skillful Lawyer, that has learned by the Laws to make good his own interest
and right, is ever also ready to right the title of others* and the judicious
Merchant, whose labor is to profit himself, yet in all his actio^^, does
there with benefit his King, Country, and fellow Subjects.

Politicians that have written of State Government, ^ Three ways whereby a
Kingdom is enriched.
have observed three principal means, whereby a Kingdom may be enriched, the
first whereof is by arms and conquest, but this way must be confessed to be,
both chargeable, bloody, and hazardable. The second is, by planting of
colonies, building of well situated Towns, and the like, and this is also
accounted uncertain, chargeable and tedious. But the third and last is by
traffike, and foraign trade, which is held the most certain, easiest, and
soonest way; money and time must be consumed to effect the two former; but
immunities, privileges, and liberties to the Merchant, will not only assure,
but perfect the latter.

In the management of these, The Artsman is still the b^st couns^llor in his
ow^ prof^ssi^n.
there is required an orderly proceeding, and Salomons counsel is the safest,
that his advice is still to be taken, who is best versed in the way that is
prescribed; when our salvation is doubted, we apply our selves to the learne^
Divine; when our country is invaded, the soldier is the best director: when
laws are to be instituted, the lawyer proves the best counselor: so when a
Country is properly seated for traffik, and the sovereign willing, by foraigne
Commerce to enrich his Kingdom, the Merchants advice is questionless best
able to propagate the same.

To enrich a Kingdom is a work of great excellency, Parents labor to enrich
their posterity
and fittest the study of the Sovereign, and where many things may concur to
effect it, that only is to be chosen* which is most facile, and least
troublesome. Many men plant trees, though they are sure never to see the fruit
thereof, and thus the child oftimes enjoyes his predecessors labors. King Henry
the eight did enjoy the benefit of Henry the seventh, and other his Fathers and
Predecessors prohibition of the exportation of our English wool, and the
settling of clothing here, and the drawing of Flemings hither, to make our
manufacturies in England, and this turned him and his Kingdom to more profit
then the suppression of so many religious houses, and the annexion of so many
old rents to his Crown. Edward the sixth, Edward the sixth, his Staple of Trade.
though in his infancy, yet saw how those haunse-townes flourished, where his
English Staples were settled, and had he gone forward with his design, of
set^ling the same in England, in apt and sit towns, for traffike, as he once
intended, doubtless it had bin the most politic and surest way to enrich his
Country, as ever had bin put in practice since the conquest, and his
successors should have seen the fruits thereof, in the opulency of their Towns,
the riches of their Country, and abundance of shipping, as now Holand does
witness unto us.

The consideration of this, The scope of this discourse for the benefit of
England, and their Traffike.
and my wel-wishes to the enlarging and benefitting of my Country by
traffic, and for the advancement of the Merchants thereof, has drawn me in
this short Treatise to set down in a brief manner, the commodities, that do
arise to a Commonwealth, by skillful Merchants and by a well ordered and
regular trade, and Commerce, therewithal showing, how this Commerce may be
facilitated, and how disturbed, how advanced, and how ruind, and how by the
good government thereof, it may prove both profitable and honorable to a
Country, and how by the ill management and irregular courses thereof, it may
be both prejudicial and dishonorable.

Statists have noted, No one way more conducible to enrich a Country, then is
foreign traffic.
that the Arts and Sciences are very many, that are commodious and beneficial
to a Commonwealth, and which consequently beget abundance, wealth, and plenty,
not only to the Prince in his own particular, but also to his people and
Country in the general, but yet amongst all others they confess none is more
conduceable thereto, then Traffike and commerce especially when the same is
gov^rned and managed, both by well ordered ru^es, and by regulate and skillful
Merchants; and to the end, that the youth of this Kingdom, may be encouraged
to undertake this profession* the painful Merchant cherished in the
prosecution thereof, and the Prince induced to give them imunities and
protection: the particular commodities and benefits, and commodities that arise
by Traffike, shall be here demonstrated, and if by my discourse the same shall
be ^ound really such, as by me and others it is conceiv^d and here aleaged; the
same may in the future be the more furthered and protected, and being found
otherwise, it may as in reason it ought, be both discountenanced and
suppressed.

Now the abundance, The riches consist in 3 things.
plenty, and riches of an estate or nation, may be said, principally to consist
in three things.

1. In natural commodities or wares. 2. In art^ficial commodities or wares. 3.
In the profitable use and distribution, of both by Commerce and Traffike.
Under the title of natural commodities, Natural commodities or war^s, What.
may be comprehended, such wares as are used in way of merchandising* and are
such as either the earth does naturally and originally afford, or such as by
the labor of the land is brought forth, and these I account the natural
riches, that bring plenty to a Kingdom or Country.

Now the earth in it self may be said, N^turall commodi^ie^ o^ 2, sorts.
to produce two several sorts of natural commodities, thence drawn from the
very intrailes thereof, such as is gold silver, copper, lead, and the like. The
second are wares growing on the face thereof, such as are fruits, trees,
grain, etc. and both these I term natural commodities, as produced either by
the benefit of the Climate, soil, or temperature of the earth, where the same
are taken up, planted or found growing, and do become thus to enrich a
Country, as a man would say, of themselves; but yet by the means of Commerce
and Traffike, How they inri^h a Countr^y.
contributing thus naturally to the benefit and use of the inhabitant, and to
the furtherance of universal Commerse; those things whose plenty (otherwise
without Traffike, and transport to other Countries, where such is wanting)
would prove altogether fruitless, unnecessary, and peradventure prejudicial
unto the owners and possessors, and this has bin manifested in some parts of
those rich Kingdoms of India, some years past, by their great quantity of
spices, drugs, and lemmes, which, not by the Commodity of Traffike, carried
thence away, exported and vented into other parts, and to remoter Countries:
Natural Commodities are p^ejudiciall to a Country, without the help^ of
Traffik^.
these excellencies which nature herein afforded them, would be prejudicial to
them, and their ground over-laid with sundry (though otherwise) excellent
trees, and exquisite Minerals, whose fruit or worth would thus not be requested
nor sought after, neither by their neighbors, nor yet by foraigne Nations,
where the same are wanting, and which would consequently no way benefit a
Country, nor yet by Commerce and commutation, supply them with those things in
lieu thereof, that they in their necessities stand more in need of.

Again, The benefits of the Earth neglected by* wh^m, and how.
the earth, though notwithstanding it yields thus naturally the richest and
most precious commodities of all others, and is properly the fountain and
mother of all the riches and abundance of the world, partly as is said before,
bred within its bowels, and partly nourished upon the surface thereof, yet is
it observable, and found true by daily experience in many countries, that the
true search and inquisition thereof, in these our days, is by many too much
neglected and omitted, which indeed proceeds from a liberty that every man
has to do, with that his own part thereof, which he possesses what he
pleases, proposing commonly to himself, a care to find out that which will
be most profitable to him for the present time, and because the rich and great
of this world, and those that possess the geeatest part thereof, are seldom
or never seen to reside upon their whole estate, nor yet found to husband
their own good, farther in this point (either by their servants or themselves)
then by a present benefit and quickest profit, their farmers and tenants are
oftnest observed to occupy the same; who like gleaners, suck and draw thence
the present profit and daily benefit thereof, The Farmers eat the marrow of
the earth, to the prejudice of the owners.
eating up the heart, and marrow of the same, with greedy art, and continual
labor, not minding, or indeed not regarding the future interest and good of
the possessor: and on the other side, where we find the owners themselves to
reside upon their own, yet it is observable, that some of them through
Ignorance, some by negligence, and too too many by bad husbandry, content
themselves with the yearly rents thereof, or at most with the Revenues, that
their predecessors drew therefrom before them; as being loath to take the
pains, either by industry, improvement or care, to increase those their
demesnes and estates, either by planting, cleansing, or manuring a waste or
barren piece of ground, or by drayning a marshy bogge, or the like, and thus to
enrich themselves by a fair advancement of their own: which in some foreign
Countries, has of late days taken such effect, partly by good orders, but
especially by example, that Princes themselves, and States have thought it a
work worthy their own pains, Sundry Princes have stu^ied the a^vanc^ment of
their estates.
and study, as the late labors of the State of Venice in Polisona de Rovigio,
of the Duke of Toscany, about Leghorne: Pisa and Creso, of the Duke of Ferrara
in the Valley of Comachio, of the States of Holand, in sundry and diverse parts
of the Low-Countryes Countries do manifestly witness, which has wrought such
good effect, that they have thereby much benefitted themselves and subjects,
and by this means, have quickened the diligence of the industrious, and
punished the negligence of the sloathfull, No commodity can enrich a Country,
without the help of Traffike.
yet notwithstanding all the laborious hand, and pains of man, to plant, sow,
or bring things growing in, or upon the earth, to their perfection; the
excellent temperature of Soil or Climate, to bring forth either Jemmes, Spice,
drugs, or grains, naturally produced from it, and whatsoever else the bounty
and goodness of the Earth can naturally, or by labor yield or afford to
mankind; yet it must be here concluded, that all this would, neither in it
self, enrich the inhabitants, nor yet bring abundance to a Kingdom or estate
without the benefit of Commerce, and Traffic, which distributeth the same
into foraine parts, and by commutation with foreign Nations, convert this
natural b^nefit of the Country, to the common benefit and plenty of those that
are found to possess, inhabit, and abide thereupon.

The second thing which I observed, The artificial wares and commodit^es of a
Country, what.
that did enrich a Kingdom, is by artificial commodities and wares, and these
by a general title, I may call the manufactories of all commodities.

In which two principal things are considerable, 2 Considerable points therein.
conducing to universal Traffike, 1 The number of workmen.
and to the benefit of a Kingdom.

First the number of the workmen, 2 Their abilities.
or Arts-masters, and this in the first place affords the abundance of the
things wrought: and secondly their sufficiency, ability, and skilfullnesse, and
this is it that gives the true credit to the fabrik^s and work it self, and
to the merchandises so wrought and perfected.

Now the over great ^umber of workmen in all manufactories, Many unskilful
Artsmen, is hurtful to Traffike.
would of it self be not only improfitable to commerce, but also hurtful, if
they were not also as good, skillful, and as cunning in their Art and mystery,
therefore to the end, not only to make them such, but als^ to keep them so,
and multiply them. We ^ee in many Countries, many societies and public
houses, erected for all sorts of m^nufactors, wherein some the poor and needy
are instructed, the skillful and good are cherished, encouraged, and rewarded,
and in other the lasie and sluggish punished and employed.

The excellent industry of the Germans, to set men ^n work.
The Germans in this point, I think excel all other nations, who willingly
admi^ of all skillful Arts-men, into their societies and corporations, though
otherwise strangers unto them, and of what nation and mystery so ever,
encouraging them by large allowances and salar^es, to practice with them, and
teach and instruct the^r fellow Townsmen. And if otherwise ignorant, yet are
they then admitted to learn and practice what they see, by which cours^ it is
o^served, that some of their Cit^es and especially their haunse. The fruits
thereof.
Towns, flourish in all wealth, and are abounding in all riches, though
otherwise peradventu^e, deprived of all natural commoditi^s, and furthera^ces
of trade whatsoever. And to this end, was first granted and erected, The
original of the Halls in London.
the Companies, Brother-hoods, Halls, and societies of these mysteries, in the
City of London, many of which were at first founded with large immunities, and
great privileges, to be encouragements to the said manufactories, and to set
the poor of those societies a work, and the better to cherish these mysteries
and Arts, Many ^rinces have been fre^ of Halls in London.
Many of our Princes have caused their names to be registered, in their
soc^eties and Corporations, for honor and in^ouragement to their Halls and
Brother-hoods: and yet when all this is done, it must b^ granted, that neither
the multitude of good able and skillful worke-men, Artificial commoditi^s
enrich not a Kingdom, without the help of Traffike.
nor yet the great quantity of real and substantial manufactories, made and
abounding in a Kingdom, can of it self either fully and thoroughly enrich or
bring plenty to a place, without the help of Commerce, which is the arm and
hand that must distribu^e, and send abroad both that store and quantity of
artificial commodities so wrought, and must export, and vent it into foreign
parts, as being otherwise a superfluity and overplus, and more indeed then the
Country it self stands in need of; and in lieu thereof, imports and
brings in by commutation and exchange, those things, and such as the place it
self stands in want of, and is thereby seen to be only and properly
enriched, for the worke-men by this means become to be encouraged, and the
manufactories to be preserved, in their real and substantial goodness,
worth, and value, to the honor of the Kingdom, benefit of the inhabitants,
and to the furtherance and enlargement of the general Commerce and Traffik
thereof.

Traffike is only able to enrich a Country, which of it self is barren.
These two points thus considered and granted, and that neither the natural
commodities of a Country, be they never so rich or precious, nor yet the
ar^ificiall commodities of a Kingdom, be they never so many or excellent, can
of themselves, without the assistance of Traffike, benefit a commonweal, or
bring plenty or abundance thereto; and consequently enrich the same. Come we
in the next place to the third point, which is this trade it self, which of it
self and by it self, can supply all defects either of natural or artificial
commodities, and that without the assistance and help of either, can yet
produce both, and is alone effectual to accomplish and perfect the same,
though in a barren place, Four considerations in the prosecution,
preservation, and augmentation of trade.
affording nether in the prosecution, preservation, and augmentation thereof;
four general considerations, are in the next place to be noted and observed.

The first consideration is grounded upon those wares and commodities, 1 What
wares to export, and what not.
that a well ordered Traffike is to export or not to export to the stranger, or
foreign Country and people.

The second consideration is grounded upon these wares and commodities, 2 What
to receive, and what not.
which this trade must receive from strangers or foreign Countries, and their
Entry or import into a Kingdom or estate, or not to receive them, and banish
the Commerce thereof.

3 What may facilitate, and ease this trade.
The third consideration, is grounded upon the facility and ease of this
Commerce in general, collected by practice of foreign nations, and
accompanied with the means of the augmentation t^ereof.

4 What commodity and benefit, this trade produces to a Kingdom.
The fourth and last consideration, is grounded upon the commod ity and benefit
of this Traffike in general to a Kingdom or estate, where the same is orderly
and regularly practiced, and that by skillful and discreet Merchants, bred up
thereunto.

First what wares are to be exported, and what not.
First then it is diversely observed, and that in sundry Countries, what the
commodities and wares in themselves are which a well ordered Traffike ought to
export and carry, into foreign Countries and nations with whom they have
Commerce.

Where in most countries it is generally observable, 1 Those whereof a place
has abundance, and how far.
that those wares are only to be carried out, by way of merchandise, whereof
the place it self has abundance and plenty, of which after that the place or
Country is sufficiently furnished, the exportation thereof may be admitted and
allowed, as contrarywis^ those commodities which the place may want, Those
which a place may stand in need ^f, are not exportable.
or stand in need of, are in no sort admitted, to be exported, nor in l^ke
manner those, whereof foreign parts may use to the hurt and prejuduce of the
place it self, Nor those that may be used to the hurt of the place.
where we abide and remain, as Arms, Horses, provisions, ammunition or things
designed to Sea, or war, or the like. And amongst the rest in many countries, it
is noted that the exportation of gold and silver, Nor gold, and silv er.
is also forbidden and prohibited, though in many places ill observed, and in
some Countries again, the same is allowed and tolerated, so that the
differing laws of sundry Princes, in diverse Kingdoms upon the exportation of
gold and silver, Gold and silver, by some exportable, and by some not.
as in some prohibited, and in some allowed and admitted, will in this place be
worth our observation, and the rather, that the reasons given thereupon, may be
examined, and the benefit or prejudice arising thereby observed, where the same
is either granted or denied.

The reason why some Princes forbid the exportation thereof.
First it must be considered and granted, that silver and gold is not growing
in every Region, and therefore as things in themselves scarce, and by all
Princes sought after, may be accounted a foreign commodity, and the rather, for
that the same carries with it, the pre-eminence, and predominancy over all
other commodities, whatsoever the worldly rich do possess, and therefore by
reason of the excellency, power, virtue, general use, and need of it, when
once it enters into some Countries and Kingdoms; the Princes thereof forbid
the exportation and carrying out of the same, upon sharp penalties and severe
punishments for fear of the want and scarcity which may arise, and come
thereby, The same found of no effect, where the contrary is allowed.
yet it must likewise be considered, as a thing granted and found true by
experience, that in some countries and free Towns, where the exportation
thereof is freely allowed and admitted, and the carrying out openly permitted
by authority; no such want or scarcity is discerned; but contrariwise, all
abundance and plenty thereof is noted, so that this being granted, the
exportation thereof may be allowed without prejudice to the state or Kingdom
where we abide: now forasmuch as that this point will hardly find admittance in
the opinion of many of our Sage Politicians, I will a little enlarge my self
thereupon, endeavoring by foraign example to make good this my assertion.

There is two differing countries, An example of both for proof.
the one a great Kingdom, where gold and Silver in the greatest plenty
grows, and the prohibition of exportation thereof, strictly observed and most
looked into, and the other a petty Dukedom, whose Prince is not owner, of
neither silver, or gold Mines at all, yet publicly, and by authority admits
an exportation of this commodity, shall serve here for demonstration and
Example of this point.

The King of Spain, richest in Mines, forbideth exportation of gold and silver,
being possessor of all the rich mines of silver and gold, in the West Indies,
found in themselves of far greater value, then all the other mines yet
discovered throughout the world, has through all his Dominions, strictly
prohibited by sharp laws, the exportation of his monyes, out of any his
Countries, and has by sundry subtle decrees, and political ordinances,
endeavored to debar all other, both neighboring, and remote Kingdoms, and
People else of partaking of his Spanish Reals, yet for all this it is observed,
that the necessities of his great and ambitious undertakings, and the urgency
of the Commerce of that his barren and poor Country, Yet finds small ben^fi^
by these restrictions.
The King of Spain then, enforces a passage and current dispersing, will he,
nill he, thereof into all Countries over the face of the earth, so that in the
height of all his store and plenty, and when he was involved in the greatness
of his greatest abundance, his Country and Kingdoms, were yet notwithstanding,
and still are, noted to be both scant, dry, and needy, of both silver and gold,
and the common Commerce and Traffike of his most eminent and richest cities,
to be wholly performed by the use of black, And his countries are traded
most, with black-monies.
and of Copper moneys, to the great disorder and confusion of his trade, and
the general ruin and undoing of his Merchants and people, and though by this
means, Turkey with whom Spain is ever in war, yet has abundance of Spanish
Ria^ls.
Turkey, with whom he is, and ever has bin, in greatest enmity, should
consequently be more bare of his coins, yet we find, that have either lived,
or do Traffike thither, that almost throughout all the Grand Seigniors
Dominions, which are both ample, large, and spacious; there is no silver coin
of note current, but the Spanish Riols, and the same not carried thither by the
hand of war, or the necessity of his designs in those parts, but by the hand
of Commerce, and concurrence of Traffike, which fills all those Countries, and
that in great abundance therewith.

The Duke of Florence has no mines admits exportation, yet has abundance of
Rials.
Now the Duke of Florence, which is only the Lord of a petty, but pretty
Seigniory, barren in its self of mines, both of Silver and Gold, makes
contrariwise no open restriction, nor public prohibition of exporting, of
either gold or silver; and whereas in Leghorn, his only noted maritine town of
trade, a million of Ducats are freely and yearly openly laden, and shipped
away, yet the Country wants it not, nor is found any way to be scant thereof,
nor is it seen, seldom to arise, or fall in price or value; nor yet is there
noted any brass or copper moneys in use amongst his Merchants in Traffic
and Comerce, so that by this experienced demonstration, Spain that should have
most, Note.
is the most barren, for all their prohibitions, and Toscany, that should have
least, affords the most plenty, by reason of its liberty of exportation and
freedom in the Commerce thereof. But it may be here alleged, that the natural
infertility of Spain, and the natural plenty of Tuscanie, may partly
occasion, or else enforce the same; to which I answer and grant, this may have
some concurrence, but no necessity: Spain in its lowest ebb, came to be the
owner of the West India.
For when as Spain in its lowest ebb became fortunately owner of the rich
West India, that Prince then by this means had silver, but yet he wanted the
other materials of Commerce, for the performance of that countries Traffike,
which other places could best afford him, and which his moneys might best, and
did then procure him; and when the Portugal, by his happy discovery, had the
East India trade alone, yet he wanted Rials to purchase the commodities of
East India, which Spain was then best able to afford him, but both these
Kingdoms joined now in one, and bowing to one and the same Scepter, it is
observable that the VVest-India affords, West India affords the moneys to drive
the EastIndia ^rade, and the East India affords the spice, and that drives the
West India trade.
now the moneys to drive the East India trade withal, and the East India
affords the rich spices, and drugs which must procure the sundry needful
diversity of European commodities, to drive the VVest-India Traffike withal;
so that a man would imagine Spain as it now stands, should not at this day
want any manner of thing to make it abound, either in moneys, or in wares and
commodi^ies, and yet we find it to be both bare and poor in their Commerce;
and notwithstanding, the so strict prohibition of the exportation of their
silver and gold, and the author^zing of so much Copper-monies current amongst
them, yet sti^l his Kingdoms to remain in great need and want thereof.

Tuskanies fertility, is attributed more to the trade, then to the Country.
And as for the fertility and plenty of Tuscany, though it must needs be in some
sort granted, yet its rich^s and abundance is to be attributed, rather to the
trade of the place and to the excellent government of the Country, in matters
of Commerce, then to the natural Clymate thereof, or industry of the
inhabitants, Oservable in 3 rules of Traffike.
for it is noted, that three well advised rules in Traffike, has brought it to
this height that now it is.

The first is the allowance of free and

The second is the easy duties and

And the third is the goodness, and

This one example then I hope will suffice, to make good the point beforegoing,
(whereto many others might be alleged) to prove that this tolleration of
exportation of moneys, makes not in it self the scarcity of silver and gold,
nether yet the prohibition thereof makes the abundance, but I will proceed no
further in this point, Merchants must submit themselves to the Laws of
Princes, where they Traffike.
save by way of caution, advise all Merchants to submit themselves, to the
Laws and ordinances of Princes, and conform themselves to the customs of the
Kingdoms and places to which they Traffike; which almost varies in every
Country, one commodity being in one Kingdom prohibited, which in another is
permitted and allowed; as we find, that Lead, a native commodity of this Land,
Some wares transportable in some Countries, and prohibited in others.
is lawfully exportable in England, but is accounted a Contrabanda, and
prohibited exportation in Spain, and in many other Countries, when once it is
imported: and we find that Woolls are prohibited also in England, yet allowed
in Spain, Iron again allowed in Spain, but prohibited in France, and
Saile-cloth, Canvas, and the l^ke, allowed in France, yet prohibited in Spain;
so is gold and silver, as aforesaid is mentioned, forbidden in England, Spain,
and France, yet allowed in Marsellia, Leghorne, Barbary, Turkey, and in many
other places.

Reasons for the prohibition of commodities, unpos^ble to be kep^.
Diverse reasons are given by Stats-men, for the prohibition of some peculiar
commodities, as I said before, but indeed many of them are impossible to be
observed in the execution; for that Country that will maintain a free Commerce
with his neighbor, makes in one Country, one Commodity lawful, which in an
other is not lawful, unless all commerce might be made by a kind of Exchange,
and bartering of Commodities against commodities, and that also practiced in
regard of the merchandise or wares, which are not very necessary, and not in
regard of those that are for the place of our aboade, and whereof we cannot
pass without; and in this case Merchants are forced to have recourse to otheir
foraign parts, and then must take a law from them, in either giving them other
merchandises, which may be as necessary for them, as theirs are for us, or in
paying or contenting them with ready moneys for the same, however it happen, A
general rule observed in prohibited Commodities.
this is found the general, Rule in this point, that a Kingdom and State does
commonly admit of the exportation and carrying out of those commodities, and
wares, which are native and growing in their Dominions, or of that whereof they
have store and plenty, not regarding the laws of other Countries, but yet some
prohibitions in these very places, are made of exporting of some commodities of
war-fare, as is seen of Iron Ordnance in England, and the like, for the
possessing thereof by our neighbors, might at one time or other, annoy and
prejudice our selves, or the place and country of our abode: within the
compass of this consideration is also comprehended those artificial
commodities, Artificial wares which are not exportable, and how far.
and wares, which are not to be carried out and exported, and such are they as
have not received their entire perfection at home, as is ordained by wools, in
England, which is not allowable, till wrought into cloth, and yet not in
cloth neither, till the same has received all necessary and fit perfection,
by dressing, dying, and the like, for thus the means of workeman-ship is taken
away from the Artist, and workman, which in some certain works, and fabrikes,
exceedes the price of the substance, and matter it self, and thereby their
lively-hoods deprived them, and a powerful furtherance and help of Commerce
is by this occasion cut off, and hindered.

This point is by some Princes so narrowly watched, The care of some Princes to
set their people on work.
and so vigilantly looked into, that they are not satisfied with those
materials, that grow amongst themselves, and in their own countries, but they
covet by all industry to draw others from their neighbors, or foraigne nations,
to employ their subjects, and to put their people on work, by this means,
much enriching themselves, and honoring their Country; and adding a great
help to the public Traffik thereof; selling and venting them thus once
wrought, even to those Nations, who many times have first sold and furnished
them with the very first materials of the said Manufactories.

Examples of this practice we find many, and that in sundry Countries and
places, Examples of the Florentines ^are, in this point.
as the Florentine, who of all others exceeds in silk Fabrikes, yet at first
provide^ much of his raw silk, in Valentia, in Spain, in Naples, and other
the neighboring Countries, and having wrought and perfited the same in
Toscany, returns it to the proud and lasie Spaniard, and to other places in
Damasces, Sattins, Taffeta's, and the like; so bringing it back wrought, to
the self same place whence it first came out raw, to be sold and vented.

And of the Dutch, before their last wars with Spain.
The Dutch likewise, buys his Woolls in Spain, carries it home to his own
house, there spins it, weaves it, and works it to perfection, then brings it
back into Spain, in Sarges, Says, and such like stuffes: and so there again
sels the same to good profit, and vents it.

And of Manchester.
The town of Manchester in Lancashire, must be also herein remembered, and
wo^thily, and for their industry commended, who buy the Yarne of the Irish, in
great quantity, and weaving it return the same again in Li^nen, into Ireland
to sell; neither does the industry r^st here, for they buy Cotton wool, in
London, that comes first from Cyprus, and Smyrna, and at home work the same,
and perfect it into Fustians, Vermilions, Dymi^ies, and other such Stuffes; and
then return it to London, where the same is vented and sold, and not seldom
sent into foreign parts, who have means at far easier terms, to provide
themselves of the said first materials

Now though it may be wished, How far this is to be che^ished.
that all other parts of our Country, could be so industrious; as thus to
procure materials of Fabrikes, for the enriching of themselves, and enlarging
of this Kingdoms Traffike, yet we find it in some places, an impossible thing
to be performed; for where the Traffike or exportation of a native commodity,
is of greater consequence to the Country, and over-valueth the commodity
imported, it is safer then, and better to preserve the native, and to neglect
the foreign, then by too much preservation of the foreign, to neglect and
ruin the native.

Besides, the native commodity may be rich, and in its self, a necessary
commodity, but the foreign a meaner, and tending peradventure more to excess,
and superfluity, then to need and necessity, as the great quantity of native
clothes, that are yearly shipped into Turkey, by the levant or Turkey Company,
having their full work man-sh^p, and perfection in England, brings in return
thereof, great quantity of Cotton, and Cotten-yarne, Grograme-yarne, and raw
silk into England, (which shows the benefit accrewing to this Kingdom by
that Company) for here the said cloth is first shipped out, Staple an^ native
commodities of a Kingdom, are in the first pla^e to be cared for.
and exported in its full perfection, dyed and dressed; and thereby the prime
native commodit^e of this Kingdom, is increased, improved, and vented, and the
Cotten-yarne and raw silk, that is yearly imported and brought in, is more
(as experience tells us) then this Kingdom can spend, vent, or any way utter,
either raw, in the same nature as it is brought in, or wrought in this Kingdom
into manufactories: here the first as the most useful, native, and excellent,
is to be first preferred and cared for, and the other yet so much cherished,
that it may as much as possible it can, And the for^aine that sets the Subject
on wo^ke, in the next to be cherish^d.
be wrought here, and perfited into Stuffes, partly to give a consumption to
the material it self, partly to set the poor Artist here on work, but
principally to further the general Commerce of this Kin^dome and Country, and
to help a valueable return, for the English cloth exported* some States have
seriously entered into consideration of this point, and have indevoured with all
possiblecare, the furtherance thereof, where it was defective, as King James of
famous Memory, King Iam^s, his provident^ are in this point.
inordered as I have been informed, that the white cloth shipped hence to the
Netherlands, by a Nonobstante should have every tenth cloth thereof, died and
dressed here, thus indeavoring by a wholesome order, to bring the whole
shipping quantity, in use amongst them, that by this means, in time to come,
all the said shipping might be drawn, to be dyed and dressed in our own
Country* and not be shipped white, as was then in use, and is still, to the
great prejudice of that clothing; but had his Majesty then been pleased, to
grant the lader thereof, some extraordinary privilege, or to be free from
custom, for any such cloth so shipped, in its full perfection, it would
doubtless before this time, have wrought better effects in this point, then
hitherto we see the former order has brought to pass.

The endeavors of some other Princes in this point.
Some again to further the same, have eased the native manufactories of their
Countries, of all customs, imposts, and such like duties in the vent or
exportation, thereby encouraging their Subjects, to make them, and their
Merchants, to s^nd them abroad, and transport them, and some have again,
charged the foreign Manufactories, which tended not immediately to need or
use, with heavy tax^s, thereby deterring the importation, and cherishing the
native work man to make the same, and to endeavor the obtainment of
perfection therein at home.

Some have also eased all raw materials, that have been imported, being
commod^ties, tending to set the poor subjects on work, as is Cotton, Hemp,
Yarne, Flax, Woolls, raw silk, and the like; and all these practiced in some
places, have met with a happy success, which has both inrich^d the Subject,
set the poor native Artists on work, and proved the maine furtherer of the
Commerce of that Kingdom, where the same has been daily, and industriously
put in use and practiced.

Second consideration what commodities are to be ^eceaved, and wha^ not.
The first point grounded upon the considerable benefit of a well ordered
Traffike, being thus handled, and having concluded what wares and commodities
may be exported, and what may not, out of an estate or Kingdom, and what has
bin practiced by foreign nations with good success; I come now to the second
consideration before mentioned, declaring what wares and commodities must be
received, and what must not be received into an estate, by the limitation of a
well ordered trade and Commerce.

All commodities tending to riot, are to be p^ohibited importations*
Some observing Statesmen, have noted that a Prince should stop the entry, and
importation by Commerce, unto all commodities, that tends to riot or excess,
as the principal means that impoverisheth a Kingdom, though many times it
enrich the trader, and Merchant, amongst which precious Stones, rich Iems,
exquisite perfumes, costly unnecessary Spices, and rich Stuffes, which serve
more for pomp and show, than for need and use, are principally noted. But how
difficult in an age or Kingdom of peace and plenty, With their difficulties.
this may be effected, I leave to the said statesmen to determine, yet
presuppose that these commodities, such as they are, be admitted their
importation, the Prince and sovereign may notwithstanding be in his own
particular a gainer, though the subject or Country therein prove loosers, for
if the use, or rather abuse of these commodities in a Kingdom, be so
inveterate, as that the same cannot be hindered, by a moderate prohibition, yet
they may be charged with such great customs and Imposts, as the merchant or
importer may have no great desire to bring them in any quantity, fearing he
shall not obtain the price they cost him; and the subject will likewise have no
earnest desire to buy them, in regard of the dearness thereof, and though
that sometimes this consideration will not, nor does not restrain the rich and
wealthy of a Kingdom, from procuring and purchasing such merchandises, yet the
sovereigns treasure, will by this means be augmented, and by this way it may
^upply in place of pun^shment, for the riot and excess in private person^, and
on the other side, the Subject desisting from the excess, though the
Sovereign gain not t^ereby, yet that Commonwealth will be both improved and
benefitted, by this chief and good husbandry.

Needful wares ever to be received.
Now for such other commodities as may be receav^d and imported, those are most
welcome, which are noted to be the most need^ull, and that the Country and
inhabitants thereof wants, and such as tend to need or use* are still the most
desired, Grain, Bu^t^r, Ch^ese, and all provisions for food, should every
where be freely received, and that without d^ties or customs thereupon, as in
Leghorne, in Tuskanie, in Spain, and in many other places: The Merchants and
bringers in of such, have ever a reward allowed them, to encourage them to a
readiness at all times, to bring in the same again, at another time and
season.

Also all ammunition for the defense of our Country, Needful for wars.
and for the offense of of our enemies, as Horses, Arms, Powder, Cannons,
Muskets, Bullets, Match, and all provision for shipping, as Planks, Timber,
Masts, Pitch, Cordage, Iron, Saile-cloth and the like, are ever to be received.

Thirdly all such commodities, And wares that set the Subject a wo^k, are to be
received.
as may set the poor or richer sort on work, by making of sundry sorts of
Fabrikes, either of Linen, and Woolen, silk or the like, as are Cotton Wool,
and yarne, of which is made Vermillions, Fustians, Demities, and such others,
also fleece-wooll, of which is made woollen-cloth, Says, Sarges, Perpetuanas,
Bays, and sundry other sorts, comprehended under the name of new Drapery with
us, also Grogrameyar^^e of which is made, James, Grograms, Durettes,
silke-mohers, and many others late new invented Stuffes, Flax, Hemp, and the
Yarne thereof, of which is made all sort of Linens, fine and course, all Ropes,
Tackles, Cables, and such like used in shipping, all raw-silke, and thrown,
whereof is made all manner of SilkeLaces, Sattins, Plushes, Taffeta's,
Cally-mancos, and many others, all silver and gold in thread, and Bullion
whereof, is made silver and gold Lace, Cloth of gold and silver, and many
others, which may set on work, not only the poor industrious working
Subjects, employ the moneys, and estates of the rich, but also much further
Navigation and Commerce, and generally enrich the Prince and Kingdom, by the
second Traffike of these Manufactories.

Yet with certain Limitations.
Yet many of these commodities and wares, are to be received with some
certain restrictions, and lamentations, according to the Judgment and
discretion of the Sovereign; For if by encouragements or Immunities, the
Merchant brings in the first materiall' as I may say, Cotten-wooll, the yarn
thereof may then be prohibited, for thereby part of the poor man's labor is
taken away, and so in Hemp, and Flax, and the like, if it be imported in good
abundance, the yarn thereof may be prohibited, for the cause before mentioned,
and so may also such petty manufactories be denied entrance, as playing Cards,
gold and silver thread, and the like, whilst we have the principal materials,
whereof the same is or may be composed, and perfitted at home. And thus much
shall serve to have said, concerning what wares may be received, and what may
not be received into a Kingdom, by the rules of a well ordered Traffike, the
facilitating and acquisition of this Traffike, ^ considerations is to
facilitate, etc ease Traffick^.
in a Country or place, comes in the next consideration to be handled.

The politic estate of Venetia, The practices of sundry Princes, to augment
Trade.
the Judicious Duke of Tuskanie, the cunning Hollanders, the industrious hauns
towns, and others, that much endeavor and study this point, have noted, and
found out many particular points, which they have put in practice, as the most
effectual, operative, and efficient, conducing to the facilitating, ease and
augmentation of Traffike in general, which gather^d out of their practices,
we may put in use, and apply to our sel^es, for the increase of a Countries
foreign Traff^ke, which principally are these.

1 To further the commodious cariadge of goods etc.
First to further by all means, the commodious carriage of goods and
merchandise both by Land and by water, either by Boats, Cartage, Horses, or
other such conveiances, wherein is considerable as a thing necessary, that the
Rivers be navigable or made so if possible, by labor, Art and industry, then
to remove all hindering Mills, Bridges, fishing wears, Banks, Sholds, and such
like impediments that may any way let or hinder the same.

Secondly, 2 No toll upon Rivers, bridges etc.
that no Lord, or adjoining commanding borderer, impose either custom, toll,
tax, or duties upon the commodities, and wares so carried in Boats, Lighters
or Barges, passing or repassing thereupon, or heavy acknowledgements, passing
over Bridges, Caus^yes, or the like, that may disturb the public Traffike, or
be a charge to the general Commerce of a Country.

Thirdly, 3 To free the Seas from Pirates.
to keep the Seas, and streams, free and safe from all Pirates, thieves, and
robbers, as the principal disturbers of the universal Traffike, of Kingdoms
and nations, and the greatest overthrowers of the navigation, and Commerce of
Cities and Countries.

4 To maintain Boys, Lights, and Castles, etc.
Fourthly, to safeguard the Ports, Harbors, Roads, and Sea-Creekes, from them,
to maintain where is necessary, fortified places, to defend the pursued, and
to offend the pursuer, to maintain and conserve the keys, Peers, molds, and
other places of moredge, fastnings, anchoredge, and the like, and to set up and
maintain, Beacons, Watch-Townes, Lights by night, Sea-marks, and Boys, for
the safeguard of Mariners sailing either by night or day.

5 To keep the ways from thieves, etc.
Fifthly, to keep the Land ways and passages, free and safe also from Thieves
and Robbers, to mend Causeys, highways and decayed Bridges, to build
alberges, Innes, lodgings and places of safety whare none is, in fit and
commodious places, for the reposing and rest of men and beasts of carryage,
where all accommodation, both for men and horses traveling, may be had at
easy and reasonable rates and prises, and where all needful things may be
obtained, for the tr^vailer which he may ordinarily stand in need of.

Sixthly, 6 To maintain the Posts, etc.
to maintain posts, and posthorses, by Land, and post barks by Sea, also all
Letter-carriers, and such like foot-posts, with privileges, and fit stipends,
for their pains and care therein.

Seventhly, 7 To put down^ Monopolies, etc.
not to suffer any Monopolies, Pattents, and grants to private men, which may
hinder the liberty, and freedom of Traffike, and if such be discouvered, and
found out, to punish the same rigorously and severely.

Eighthly, 8 To invite industrious strangers by privileges*
to invite by privileges, the industrious strangers, and Merchants, to bring
and import unto us, the wares and commodities, which we cannot want, and those
whero^ the Country it self stands in need of, and that which may either
advantage the public, or the defense of the Country it self.

9 To discha^ge all great customs.
Ninthly, to discharge all great custom, heavy imposts, and duties upon all
goods and merchandise, or at least wise upon the Subjects goods, and upon all
needful and useful commodities, or if the same stand not with the commodity
of the Prince, yet at least wise; so much of these customs etc. As the
necessity of the state will bear, and trade may well permit, without
overthrowing of the general Traffike, and Commerce of the Country, and the
dependances thereupon.

10 To establish Sea Laws, for Merchants and navigator.
Tenthly, to establish such Laws, and ordinances for Merchants, and
merchandising affairs, and Sea causes, as that there be not only faith and
assurance, preserved amongst all negociators, Sea-faring-men, and merchants
whatsoever, but also amongst all manner of buyers, and sellers, and that there
be likewise severe punishments decreed for fraudulent and public dec^avers,
bankerouts, and robbers of the common Traffike, of a nation or Country.

Eleventhly, 11 To erect a^ Court of Mercha^ts.
that in case of differences, debates, controversies, and the like accidents,
happening in Traffike amongst Merchants, there may be a summary, and speedy
Justice executed, either by a quickened law, or a Court of Merchants, as it is
observed and practiced in many Countries, especially in that which concerns
strangers, who oftentimes are noted to forbear their Traffic into a place,
no less, in regard of the charge and tediousness of suits, then for the
tretchery and falsehoods of the inhabitants of the Country.

Twelfthly, 12 The Coins current to be constant and good etc.
and forasmuch as a permutation of Commodities cannot be well made, without a
certain price set down upon all merchandises, and that they cannot negotiate
with all sorts of people, simply by Exchange, but that it is necessary to make
use of the moneys and Coins of Princes, in their several distinct Countries,
the value, price, and estimation thereof, must be therefore certain, constant
and firm, otherwise it would bring a confusion to the general Commerce of a
Kingdom, and every commodity must then be governed in esteem and value,
according as the money shall be current in price.

Neither is this only sufficient, but the real goodness, and true value of
these Coins must be easy, to be judged, and known, not only by the weight
thereof; but also by the eye, and sound of the same, if it be possible, the
which may be the easier done, if there be no metalls used in Coin current,
but only silver and gold, which is sufficient in themselves, to expr^sse all
sums, and quantity, ^ow little and small soever, and if every piece both of
silver and gold, be Coined by a certain weight, thick^esse, and greatness,
and in form of certain med^lles, as the GRECIANS, LATINS, HEBREWS, PERSIANS,
and EGYPTIANS, in old time did use, it would prove a difficult thing for a man
to be deceived therewith, and it would be facile for all strangers, and
Merchants, to be soon experienced, and acquainted with them

Thirteenth, 13 To give honor to merchants, and why?
whereas some ignorant estates and foreign nations, do contemn M^rchants,
and merchandising, and such as exercise Traffike, holding and undervaluing, the
Art of merchandising in its self, as base and sordid, which too often is found
in many places quickly to decay the public commerce of some Kingdoms, for
thereb^ it comes to pass that they which have gotten a little wealth, retire
themselves speedily to embrace some other vocation, to the which the common
people carry more respect and honor, then to this.

It being a thing, which in all civil and well governed Kingdoms, ought
carefully to be avoided, and removed, for the good and furtherance of the
Traffike thereof; now indeed it must be granted, that there be certain
trades, which should be left to the poor and common people, to enrich
themselves by; but there are others, more noble, which they only can best
execute, that are conversant in foraign Countries, which is that of
Merchandising in remote parts, by the benefit and commodity of the Sea,
Merchandising is the most profitable i^ an estate.
and that by persons qualified and versed in foreign regions, which in it
self is the most knowing, profitable, beneficial, and excellent in an estate,
as shall be showed in this following Treatise, and to these more honor and
respect should be attributed, then is now done, both in France, and in some
other Countries, for if in all estates, the wise, jud^cious, and prudent
Coun^ellours of a Pr^nce, have thought it fitting, and requisite to invite the
Subjects by honor, to the most dangerous and hazardable attempts and actions,
which may be profitable and conduce to the benefit and profit of the public;
these two of Navigation by Traffike, and of Commerce by navigation, being of
that concurrent quality, and united disposition, they should propound and
attribute more honor to those that shall deal therein, and exercise the same,
then now it is noted they do. And if true Nobility should have taken its
foundation, Why such should be honored.
(as the Iud^cious and Learned have observed heretofore) from the courage of
men, and from their Valor, there is no vocation, wherein there is so many
useful and principal parts of a man required, as in these two, for they are
not only to adventure and hazard their own persons, but also their estates,
goods, and what ever they have, amongst men of all nations, and Customs,
Laws, and Religions, wheresoever they are inhabited.

And that not only in common casualties, mishaps, and dangers, but somesomes
to wrestle and stand even against the four Elements, combined together, to
threaten their ruin, and destruction, which is the strongest and most
remarkable evidence and proof, that possibly can be alleged or spoken, of
the constant and firm resolution of a man.

This sole point and consideration, has been the occasion, that some States
have been of opinion, and thought that this door should be opened, to the
adventuring Merchant to attain unto Nobility, so as the Father and the Son,
have continued succesfully for some ages therein; and which is seen in ^ome
sort to be practiced in some places at this day, and if those Noblemen, (the
upholders of a Land or Kingdom) who are commonly the riche^t and greatest in
an estate, should practice and addict themselves to this Commerce, and
Sea-Traffike (as some began to do in Queen ELIZABETH'S days) being a thing
not prejudicial, nor hurtful to their honor, or to their noble condition,
doubtless it is, and would be more honorable unto them, then to be
Vsuerers, and Bankers, as is observed in Italy, and many other Countries as
they are, or to impoverish themselves, in doing of nothing, or naught worthy
of note, but neglect their own occasions, in spending, lavishing, and wasting,
when peradventure they never gather any thing to what they have, or what was
formerly was left unto them, by their Ancestors. Hence would grow many
advantages, The benefit of the Trade of Nobles and rich in a kingdom.
both to the public and private, for that they that thus deal in traffike,
having thus means, courage, and sufficiency, for this Conduct and Enterprise,
the same would be far greater, and more eminent in it self, then now it is,
setting thus more ships to sea, and by being consequently better armed, and
better furnished; and whereof the state in time of need, might make good use
of, for its safety and defense; and withal it would carry the reputation of
that Nation, far further into remote Regions; the which they cannot do, who
being poor, and having little or no stock, but of one ages gathering, or
peradventure taken up at Interest, and borrowed from others, wanting both
power, means, and courage, either to hazard themselves in great, and eminent
Enterprises, or to wade through the same, being once entered thereinto.

And for other particular Interest, this Commerce being wisely managed, and
discreetly handled, what hazard soever they should run, there is more to be
gotten thereby, then to be lost: And if Gentlemen in general would thus apply
themselves to traffike, as some within these late years have been observed to
do, and that without wasting of their estates by vast Expenses, or importuning
their Sovereign by disorderly demands and gifts, they should by all
likelihoods benefit themselves more in one year, by a well governed traffic
at sea, then peradventure at Court by ten years waiting and solicitations.

Finally, to conclude this point, Experience has taught, and teaches us
daily, where those of great purses, and good judgments have exercised
traffic, and where such have been backed and encouraged by a gracious, and
furthering Sovereign, and by a Prince that loves Navigation, and favors
Traffic; it has mightily enriched both themselves, and the Princes and
Estates, under which they have lived; as by the late Examples of the Portugal,
Hollander, Spaniard, and Venetian is made known, and manifested unto all the
world.

Next to erect and settle an office of assurance, 14: To erect an assurance
office.
with fit and skillful Judges, which should determine, and give speedy
Execution in their Decrees and Acts, between Adventurers, to avoid demurs,
delays, and hindrances, that happen by tedious suites in adventures at sea
amongst Merchants.

Fifteenth, 15. To erect some Companies.
the only means conceived to settle the Commerce and Traffic of a Nation into
foreign Countries by sea, in the which the best purses will not be drawn to
hazard themselves in the Enterprise, is to compel the Merchants which trade at
sea, to one and the self same certain place and country, to join one with
another in a corporation, and Company, and not to make their Traffic by
themselves asunder, or apart; for although that adventuring apart, the Gain
would probably be the greater to the Adventurers, when the enterprise succeeds
happily; yet it is to be considered, that the loss which may happen, would
wholly ruin him that attempts the danger alone; and if in making a joint
Company, or Society, the Gain should turn to be the less; yet it is ever
more assured, and the disorders by Traffike by a good government is still
removed; and the loss being borne by many, it is consequently the less to
every one that is interessed therein; and thus dividing the ^rade of the whole,
according to either the places, or coasts where the same is made, forbidding
them to attempt one upon another privileges; and prohibiting all other
private Subjects (of what quality soever) which shall not be Members or free
Brothers of those Societies, to negotiate into those parts upon great
penalties, and appointing certain Governors, or others the greatest
adventurers, to order and regulate the said Traffike and Companies; which Rules
have found such good success, both in Holland, England, and elsewhere, that
it has been one of the maine causes, that has brought the traffike of
London, and of Amsterdam, to that present height and greatness, as it is now
observed to be. 16. To lend money to the Merchant out of the common Treasury.


Next for the furtherance of the Traffike of some Kingdoms, it has been
observed, that great sums of moneys have been lent gratis, or upon easy
rates and security, to skillful Merchants, out of the sovereign, or common
Treasury, which has also found such good success, as that the customs of
that Prince have been thereby much increased, the kingdom enriched, the poor
set on work, and the native Commodities thereof, vented to all parts of the
world thereby. 17. By transportation of Bills.


In the next place, it has been noted mainely to further the traffike of a
Kingdom, the transportation of bills of debt, from one man to another, in liew
of moneys, as is used in some Countries; for thereby many Law suits are avoided
amongst Dealers, errors in Merchants accounts cleared, the Princes customs
increased, the great stock of the Kingdom, which continually lies in all
Negotiators hands in dead Bills and Bonds, employed, Traffike it self
quickened, and such a benefit enjoyed thereby to the Commonwealth, as cannot be
expressed.

In the next place it has been observed in some places, 18. Example of the
Princ^, a maine Furtherer of Trade.
where the poor for want of abilities cannot trade, and where the great or
rich have not will, or dare not adventure their Estates in foreign Traffike,
that the examples only of the Prince has thoroughly effected it, and proved a
mai^e Furtherer of the general Commerce and Traffike of his Country; which
does not only hold in this matter of Trade, but in all other state matters
whatsoever; for then it will be impossible for the rich Subjects to forbear;
when they see their Sovereign bend his mind, and addict himself thereunto. For
the wise have observed, that Princes cannot frame an Age unlike unto
themselves; Cassiod. 11.3.
and that it is easier (as one said) for Nature to err, then that a Prince
should form a Commonwealth unlike himself: Just if they be wicked, regular if
they be dissolute, chaste if they be immodest, and religious if they be
impious.

Neither is it thus in these our days; History it self warrants the point,
and makes it good in all former ages. For, under Romulus it was found that Rome
was warlike; but under their Soverain Numa they were religious, under the
Fabritii they were continent, under the Catoes Regular, under the Graccbi
seditious, under the Lucalli and Antonines, intemperate and dissolute; under
Constantine the Great the Empire is Christian, but under Julian idolatrous:
Therefore, for conclusion, if the Prince love the sea, his Subjects will be all
Seamen; and if he be a Lover of trade and traffike, the rich and powerful of
his Kingdoms, will be all Merchants.

In the next place, it has been noted as an effectual mean, 19 By erecting
a staple of ^rade.
whereby traffike may be obtained and settled where none is, is by erecting a
staple of trade, and to indow the same with freedom of traffike, which briefly
may be termed to contain some of these before recited particulars, especially
those of great privileges, and small customs; for this will gain Trade where
none is, and being gotten mightily increase the same, when this shall fall out
to be in a Country, where God and Industry has blessed the Land and people
with wares, that are either rich or useful, it will soon beget, maintain,
and in large the Trade of the place, so made a staple, as above is said.

Now for as much as this staple is in many countries a thing unknown, and that
many men are ignorant of the benefit that the same may produce, I will a little
enlarge my self thereupon, and in few words show how it may turn a Kingdom
to profit, and by perusing the commodity it affords to other nations,
conceive it may yield the like to that Prince that cove^eth the same, or
puts this rule in practice: A staple of trade what.
A staple of Trade is a place then, where large immunities and privileges are
granted to all Merchants of what nation soever; sometimes extending to native
commodities only, and sometimes to foreign, and sometimes to both, with free
liberty, to ^xport and import all manner of wares custom free, when, whither,
and by whom they please, paying a small acknowledgement only in liew of the
said cu^tome to the Prince, and wheresoever the same has thus been seen to be
settled in a Kin^dome, it has been noted much to encourage the inhabitants
thereof, and force them in a short time to become either great Merchants, or
industrious Furtherers thereof; for the same would yield them occasion to be
sharers in the traffike of other Countries, whereof before they neither had any
profit, nor yet the Prince any customs thereby: the benefit of this staple of
Trade may be the better discerned by looking upon the practice of those
Countries, The benefit of a staple by the experience of other Countri^s.
where the same is put in use, and especially by our Neighbors the
Netherlanders, where the same is practiced with wonderful industry, pains,
care, and conducible profit, instanced by these examples.

No timber in Holland, and yet they have the staple thereof.
First it is well known to us, and all the world, that they have there no
timber, nor yet Forests of any sort, of their own growth, yet the freedom of
Trade begets them such fit materials, that the same builds them yearly above a
thousand sail of ships, partly serving to their own use, but principally to
sell to others; and that the huge pales of wainscot, Claboard and Deal are in
their staple Cities.

No corn there, and yet they have the staple thereof.
Next, they are found to have no corn growing almost in all their countries;
for it is the East Country that affords the same in abundance; yet we know
that the greatest Storehouses, and staple Granaries of grain^, is by the
freedom of their trade in the low Countries; for Amsterdam (if report may
gain credit) is continually stored with 8. in 100000. quarters, besides what
is by trade daily sold away and vented.

The maine shooles, No fish there, yet the staple thereof is in Holland.
and massy bulk of Herrings, from whence their industry and traffike raises
to them so many millions yearly, proceeds merely out of our English seas; but
yet the great Fishery (to the shame and wonderful dishonor of England) is in
the Low countries; wherewith not only their own occasions at home are
plentifully supplied, but all Christendom besides, abundantly stored, it being
computed, that they send forth yearly into other Countries, above one hundred
thousand last, which we may account to be two hundred thousand tuns.

The large and mighty vast Vineyards, No Vineyards nor salt in Holland, yet
they have the staple thereof.
and great quantity and sto^e of salt, is noted to be in France and Spain, yet
the great Vintages, as I may say, and staples both of Salt and Wine, is found
in the Netherlands, whereby they employ yearly above a thousand sail of their
shipping.

No Wools there, and yet they have the staple of manufactories
The Wool, Cloth, Lead and Tin, and diverse staple English commodities, are
properly and naturally of Englands production, but yet, to the dishonor and
prejudice of England, the great Manufactories of Dying, Dressing, etc. of them
are seen in the Low Countries, whereby they not only employ their poor by
labor, but their Mariners by shipping, and often times under-sell the English,
both in their own countries, and abroad, with these and other our own
commodities.

Light customs increase trade, and heavy ruin it.
Many others in this kind may be produced; for it is to be noted, that
wheresoever such a staple of trade is erected, kept and maintained, there all
foraine and native commodities do abound, for the supply of any other
country, that may or does want the same; and where the customs upon Merchants
goods is small, it easily draws all nations to trade with them; and
contrariwise where great impositions are laid upon Merchants goods, the
traffike of the place, will be seen soon to decay, to the prejudice of that
place and kingdom.

The difference thereof is made evident in any two towns of several Princes
Dominions: Example thereof between England, and Holland.
in the one, where customs are easy, and there Merchants do flock together
from all parts of the world, and abundance of foraine commodities are from all
countries imported thither, that benefit the Merchant, the people, and the
Prince; and in the other, where the customs are heavy and burdensome to a
Merchant, and heavy upon his wares, and there none comes, nor brings any
commodities, but what he knows is liable, and must pay this custom to his
and the countries great prejudice; which by an example or two I shall here
manifest.

Two ships laden at Burdeux, In a ship of 300. tuns come from Burdeux.
of equal burden, viz. of three hundred tuns, the one goes for England, and
the other for Holland; Paying in England 1260. and in Holland 60. 1.
she that comes into England* pays for custom, Prisedge, Butleredge, and
other charges thereon by book of rates, one thousand two hundred pounds and
upwards, before she be discharged, and the other going for Holland is
discharged there for threescore pound sterlin, or there abouts; so that after
they have there unladen their said ship, and custom being paid, and the wines
sold, the buyer can transport them again into some other country; and, if he
should in the second place but gain this custom that was paid in England, yea
or half so much, he would think to have gained very well thereby: but it is
not possible for any English man to pay this great custom in England, and to
transport them again into another Kingdom, but he must be a great loser by
them; for the Hollander can still under-sell him, and yet be a gainer thereby.

In 200. ^uns of Tobacco.
The like may be alleged of two ships, of two hundred tuns a piece, coming
alike laden, with 200. tuns of Tobacco from Barmuda, Saint Christopher, or any
other English Plantation: now, this 200. tuns paying custom, etc. in England,
will amount unto 10000. pounds, whereas in Holland the said 200. tuns will be
cleared for 120. pounds. Now though the said 200. tuns of Tobacco should be
here again shipped out within the year, and the impost repaid him, yet the
Merchant loses infinitely by bringing it into the kingdom, which he would
account for wonderful gain, might he enjoy the same upon all the whole
parcel toward all his adventure, interest and charges.

But some Princes may imagine that this will too much diminish their customs,
These small customs, will increase the total custom of a Kingdom.
and draw their Revenewes to a low estate: but I rather hold the same will be
a means to increase the same; for though a Prince should for the ease of his
people, and the augmentation of the trade of his Country, take but a small
custom upon all foreign goods imported, and thus exported with the
reservations mentioned in the second consideration of trade* yet he may have a
moderate custom to be paid him, upon all goods vented within the Kingdom, as
is now used in England; and the multiplicity of trade, which will be procured
by this staple, and small custom, whereof there is not otherwise accruing to
the Prince any profit at all, will much increase the same in the total.
Presuppose that this staple of traffike, furthered with such immunities and
smalness of customs, were in some one, two, or three convenient Towns settled
here in England, let us consider the good in general, that by the former
assertion it would produce to us.

First the Merchants would be enabled to export the commodities of France,
Benefits arising to England by a staple of trade.
Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Barbary, and of the East and West India, into the
Kingdoms of Germany, Poland, Denmark, Swethland, Pomerland, Sprucia, and
Lifeland, and the merchandise of those other count^ies, which are both many and
useful, will again be transported from the said staple, to those Southern
and Western Countries, and hereby the Merchants would mightily flourish by
this enlargement of trade.

Secondly, diverse sea-Townes, where this staple should be kept would be very
much enriched.

Thirdly, the Mariners and shipping of this Kingdom, would hereby come to be
very much enlarged and employed.

Fourthly, many poor people, and other handy crafts men and laborers, would
be hereby set on work, and employed.

Fifthly, the honor and reputation of this Kingdom will be much advanced in
other countries, and much Bullion would thereby come to be imported.

Sixthly, it will keep all sorts of grain at a reasonable price, both for the
buyer and seller, and the country should always be well provided with corn,
if dearth should happen, and thereby also retain our coin, which upon such an
occasion is usually exported.

Lastly, the customs of England would be much increased by intercourse of
trade, both by Importation and Exportation of all sorts of foraine commodities,
whereof we have no use our selves, and whereof His Majesty has at present no
custom at all, because there is no such course of trade in use.

Having thus showed how this staple of trade is to be settled, and what benefit
it brings with it to that country where the same is erected, and may bring to
us were the same here settled; and because in all Kingdoms it is a work of
time and much difficulty, and that our ordinary Statesmen do neither
seriously consider, nor truly weigh the real benefits that arise to a Kingdom
and people by the hand of traffike; I will here in the last place, for
conclusion of this consideration, show that a maine Furtherer of a countries
traffi^e, and the only way for the preservation thereof, being once acquired, is
to settle by authority of the Sovereign a selected number of able and discreet
Merchants, with power and sufficient privilege, to examine the disorders of
traffike, and irregular Traders, and to reduce the same to such orders, and
constitutions as may stand with the benefit and good of the Sovereign, his
country and subjects; and these Merchants to be either sworn and admitted
into the Princes counsel, or have a superintendency over the general Commerce
of the kingdom, by themselves entitled as State-merchants, or Merchant
Statesmen; the benefit of whose endeavor, skill, judgment, and discretion
thus authorized, I shall by these few rules offer to the consideration of the
Judicious.

It is by all Statesmen accounted a truth undeniable, By enlargement of
traffike.
that the wealth and welfare of all countries (where the subject exercises
traffike with foreign nations) is mainely f^rth^red, and much advanced by the
regular orders, and merchantlike rules thereof, and more especially in that of
Englands, by nature commodiously seated to that end, and of purpose; the
procurement of which wealth and welfare by the enlargement of Commerce, and the
well ordering and regulating thereof, cannot be so fully effected, nor the
hindrances foreseen, nor the prejudices so soon avoided by a mere
Statesman, as the same can be by a discreet Merchant, qualified with power
from the Prince to that purpose.

^ By importation and exportation. of Bullion.
Secondly, the importation of Bullion to the Princes Mint, or exportation of
his coin out of his country, cannot be so well foreseen and prevented as by
the Merchant, who by the course of traffike, knows the impediments of the one,
and the preventions of the other.

3. By undervaluing of native wares.
Thirdly, the under-valuing of the homebred, and native commodities of a
Kingdom, and the over-valuing in that Kingdom of foreign commodities, with
the discommodity of both to the common wealth, nor the causes thereof, cannot
be so well known to a Statesman, nor by him be prevented, as the same can to
a Merchant, qualified with power thereunto.

Fourthly, 4. By new Plantations.
the enlargement of trade by any new Inventions Plantations, or Discoveries of
new traffikes, cannot be by any so well furthered, as by a qualified Merchant,
who best knows by reason of his trade, what privileges are fit to be granted,
what customs invvards and outward to be imposed, and for the encouragement of
the Merchants, and Undertakers in these said courses.

Fifthly, 5. By rising and falling of cust^mes.
it is granted that the greatness of customs, and other duties upon Merchants
goods, in all places diminishes the trade of a Kingdom, and the smalnesse of
the same inlargeth the trade thereof; now a mere Statesman conceives not what
commodities are fittest to be eased, and which are to be raised for the common
good, and profit of the trade of that Country.

6 By employment of workmen in the Manufactories.
Sixthly, the general employment of all the poor of a kingdom in the
workmanship of native, and homebred commodities, and foraine materials
imported (now too little regarded by many Statesmen in many Kingdoms) may
with more ease and speed be put in Execution by a States-merchant then by a
mere Statesman, as is seen in the dying and dressing of clothes in England,
and in the prosecution of the Fishing-trade, lately here set on foot by the
care and industry of diverse noble personages, and lost for want of experienced
men in that profession to manage the same.

7. By furni^hing de^ayed t^wns.
Seventhly, as a matter worthy of a Princes consideration, the furnishing of
decayed haven Towns, with inhabitants, Mariners, and shipping in a kingdom,
and the needful helps and furtherances thereto, with a profitable trade to
maintain both, to their, and the Prince and countries good, is better
performed by a Merchant, then by a mere Statesman.

8. By providing of corn^ in dearth.
Eighthly, the continual furni^hing of a Kingdom with corn at cheap rates,
yea even in times of Dearth, the want whereof some years past the last great
Dearth, enriched Holland for seven years following, and impoverished England
full as long, by their exportation of two millions of pounds, as is conceived
that year out of all ports of this Kingdom in gold, wherein a mere Statesman
knows not the way, neither how to provide for the one, nor yet how to prevent
the other; which notwithstanding a Merchant can with ^ase, and better
husbanddry accomplish and perform.

Ninthly, 9. By settling of a staple of trade.
the settling of a staple, or freedom of trade in a kingdom, in commodious and
fit places, with fit and advantageable privileges, and how the same is to be
governed and directed, and wherein to be restrained and limited, is only
within the knowledge of a Merchant, and fittest for his direction, which a
mere Statesman does not so well understand, nor can judge of.

10. By weakening the enemies by trade.
Tenthly, Solomon says, that wisdom is better then the weapons of war,
therefore a Merchant can in times of wars with foraine Princes, better direct
how to weaken his enemies, in course of their traffike, and prejudice them in
the point of their profit, and cross their designed intentions, for provision
of warfare, more then the best Statesman can do by open hostility.

11. By treatises of peace in trade.
Tenthly, In concluding of a peace, or in the making of leagues, and amity with
foraine Princes, the Merchant can advise of the fitting conditions, to be
insisted upon, and obtained in the point of traffike, for the advancement of
his King and Country, which a Statesman does not so much regard, nay many
times not yet understand.

12. By forain intelligence.
Twelfth, A Merchant that has been resident, many years in foraine parts,
and sometimes has remained all that time in one and the same Country, and
has afterward continual advice from his Factors there resident, by reason of
his daily trading thither, of all the occurrences of the place, with their
provisions made there for arming of h^rse, foot, or shipping, must needs
consequently understand thereof, and the affairs of those parts, better then
those that never were th^re, or but cursorily to see fashions, and that
peradventure many years before that time.

Thirteenth, 13. By suppressing of trades depending upon exportation of coin.
A Merchant knows by his observations in course of trade, that there be some
trades in a Kingdom, which cannot subsist, nor be driven without exportation
of the coin of that kingdom and place, or which cause the diversion of
Bullion from the Mint of that place, which are not to be cherished, as those
trades are which do neither; all which a mere Statesman cannot so well
comprehend, and take notice of.

Fourteenth, 14. By cherishing some trades that subsist by coin.
A Merchant does know that there be some trades again, which cannot subsist
without this exportation of the coin of a kingdom, and have a necessary
dependence thereon, which yet notwithstanding are to be cherished, sometimes
equal, sometimes above other trades, by reason that the same trade begets
another advantageable trade, that does more profit to the kingdom, then the
exportation of that coin does prejudice the same; which a Statesman can
neither discern, nor take notice of.

15. By acts prejudicial to trade.
Fifteenth, A Merchant does know what decrees and ordinances made in a
Kingdom, do further and enlarge the trade thereof, and which again in
themselves do hurt and prejudice the same: also what decrees and ordinances
are enacted in foraine states or countries, that are injurious and hurtful to
the trade and country where he abides, and how to meet with, and prevent the
same by counter Decrees, and Regulations; which a mere Statesman does neither
know, nor can of himself prevent or have notice of.

16. By remedying the foraine disorders in trade.
Sixteenth, A Merchant does find by his traffike into foraine parts, what
commodities, and what nations are eased by foraine Princes within their
dominions, to the end that by charging of some, and easing of other some, they
covet to benefit some nations more then other, and further the vent of some
commodities more then others, redounding to the prejudice and ill consequence
of the Kingdom of his aboade and residency; which the Merchant can in a short
time both prevent and remedy, to the good of that Kingdom where he lives; but
the Statesman cannot in a long time find out, nor yet being found out remedy
it, till peradventure the remedy be worse then the disease.

Seventeenth, 17. By carrying out or in of commodities hurtful or beneficial
to a kingdom.
A Merchant knows what commodities can be drawn out of another country, to
the benefit of his own, and what commodities are carried out of his own
country, to the prejudice (as Iron-Ordnance are in England,) or benefit of ano
there, and can by regular orders in the course of traffike hinder the
importation, and exportation of what is hurtful, or any way dammageable to the
Kingdom of his aboade, and further the importation and exportation of such
commodities as are prejudicial to the traffike of the strange and remote
Country; which the Statesman for want of knowledge in merchandising cannot
effect or accomplish.

18. By importation of materials for Manufactories.
Eighteenth, A Merchant can advance his Country by the importation of
materials for Manufactories to be wrought at home, and by this means set
multitudes of poor on work, to the great benefit of the place of his aboade,
and can by reason of his travels into foraine parts, where he sees the
natural and profitable commodities of other Nations, transport the same, and
sometimes plant them in his own native soil, for his Countries good and
honor; which the Statesman cannot without great difficulty perform and
effect.

Lastly, 19. Foraine decrees that prejudice navigation and shipping.
the Merchant best knows what Decrees are constituted in foraine Countries,
that hinder the Navigation, and diminish the shipping of the country of his
aboade, and what orders and injunctions are imposed at home, that insensibly
ruin and destroy the same, either by means of grants, made to private persons
to the prejudice thereof; or by innovations imposed by Farmers, or other
Under-officers, that either destroys the same, or tends to the
discouragement of Seamen; which mere Statesmen cannot so soon discern, nor
yet in fitting times remedy.

To conclude this point, having thus showed the courses that are used in sundry
Countries, for the settling, preserving, and augmentation of Commerce in
general, and withal considered how far in his own person a Merchant is
able to benefit, and advance his Country and place of his aboade, and how a
staple of trade may be erected, settled and privileged with fitting liberties,
to gain an ample traffike where none is, and showed withal the commodities
that arise to the Country, where the same is so settled and maintained.

The endeavors of sundry Princes to gain traffike.
I will now, for conclusion of this third consideration, run through and
briefly survey the mavelous care, cost and pains, that several Princes have
willingly been at and undergone, to compass the same.

By what has been said then in this consideration, and upon this point, it
may be gathered, that the obtaining and acquisition of a traffike at the first
is very difficult, being as a precious Jewel which must be sought after,
courted and purchased with many privileges, liberties and immunities, and
sometimes with the very example of the Prince himself, because that the
honor, benefit, and commodity that does still attend it (as I shall declare in
the close of this discourse) extends itself both to the Sovereign, his
Nobles, Kingdom, and subjects in general: and to the end that it may appear,
that all Judicious Princes, and Politic States*men have thus judged thereof,
and found the effects of the same answerable to this my assertion; I will here
briefly declare, and show the industrious pains, and painful endeavors of
sundry the wisest Princes of Europe, to acquire, purchase and obtain this so
excellent a Jewel.

The Dukes of Toscany, The practice of the Duke of Florence to get the trade of
Leghorne.
being ever accounted expert Exchangers, finding that their Dukedom, by reason
of the want of a Seaport, for the receipt of shipping, was very unfit to
entertain a trade by Navigation, purchased the town and Territory of Leghorne,
of the Commonwealth of Genoa, at the rate (as some report) of one hundred and
twenty thousand Dollers (it being then a poor Fisher-towne, capable only to
receive small Barks, and that of no considerable burden) and did, for the
enlarging of his traffike by sea, add a fair and pretty new built-Towne to
the old, fortifying the same with Walls, Ditches, Castles, a Bannia for his
slaves, and a Lasseretta, or a Pesthouse, to receive both the goods and
persons of such as should arrive there from contagious and infected parts; then
he gave a dwelling to all for seven years gratis, that would come to inhabit
there, then he erected a Watchtower with a strong mould to preserve the ships
that anchor there from the violence of all weathers; he gives his Merchants
many privileges, cuts a ditch for twenty miles, to convey and carry up all
commodities to Pisa, and so to Florence the Metropolis of his Dukedom; to
conclude, by making it a free scale, and that all manner of goods, wares and
moneys may be freely shipped inwards, and outward, without any charge or
custom; and that when commodities do arrive, which the purses of his subjects
will not, or cannot purchase, he has himself bought up the same, and that
sometimes to his loss and prejudice, he has I say by these and other the
like means within this 25. or 30. years, made this the greatest port of
traffike in all the Mediterranean seas, to his own great honor, and to the
exceeding profit, and commodity of himself, and all his subjects in general.

The Hollanders, Of the Hollanders to support their trade.
who have need of all the politic helps that can be, to support the charges of
their war against a potent enemy, who is continually ready at their doors to
give them the alarm, yet so well do study this point of traffike, and make so
much of Commerce in their country, where indeed they hold but a hand-full (as
it were) of land to abide in; though, I say, they have annual Armies afoot,
which does cost them infinite, vaste and great sums to maintain and nourish,
and that their very bread, meat, and beer which is eaten by them, does first
pay the States an excise thereon; yet in all their extremities, dangers and
debts, they have erected many staples of trade in their countries, and also
raised an East India and West India Company of Merchants, with large
privileges, which they have prosecuted with happy and good success, whereon,
notwithstanding their great disbursements, they impose little or no customs at
all, their interests are easy, their Companies countenanced, and protected by
the Estates, and their Fleets are ready in our Channel, to safeguard and
defend both the Merchants, Mariners and Fishermen from the depredation, and
violence of either enemies or Robbers.

Of the Venetians.
I am not able to recount how, and with what care and industry the Venetians
maintain their traffike, and the liberties of their subjects; in point of
Commerce they ease them of customs, give large privileges to their Mariners,
injoyne their ancient gentlemen, and Clarissimi to use the sea, make daily
sundry advantagable decrees and orders for the suppressing of foraine traffike,
and advancing of their own, keep a selected Court of the best experienced
Merchants, to superintend other Commerce, and have a stock ever in readiness
by the name of Cottimo to expend both in Turkey and other places, for the
defense of their Merchants and their Estates, from all wrong and injuries.

Yet none of these comes near the care and industrious prudence, Of the East
Kings of Portugal.
practiced by John and Emanuell, Kings of Portugal, in erecting, prosecuting,
and settling the trade of the East India, with such provident decrees and
immunities for the ordering of their returns, Lectures for the instruction of
their Pilots, and Seamen, building of Forts and Holds to make good and
preserve their traffike, to their exceeding honor and profit in getting those
small Islands of India, but of most notable consequence, Mosambike, Ormus, Dieu,
Goa and Mallacca, fit Receptacles of trade and strength, and which have to this
day preserved to them the Commerce of all others, the parts of India. Isabella,
that famous Queen of Castile, having by her Christian Piety spent her own
estate in prosecution of the wars against the Moors of Granada, Mu^tia, etc.
when yet she and her husband Ferdinando's Crowns and Revenues were drawn dry,
and far engaged in chasing those Barbarians out of their Kingdoms, then when
Henry the seventh, accounted amongst the wisest of our English Kings, had
unhappily refused Columbus, the Genoes his offer, for the discovery of the
Western Continent, now termed America, then I say being laden with her
greatest debts and engagements, her Coffers, empty, her Church plate spent, and
all drawn to the lowest ebb by loanes and interests, then did she for
encouragement to all her subjects, and for to comply with the resolution of
that brave Italian, pawn her own wearing Jewels, to set him out in three
Carvels; where how he thrived, and how that Kingdom, Prince and People have
been bettered thereby eversince, the whole Christian world may witness at
this day, as England has had just cause to repent of ever after.

But Henry the seventh having now seen his error, Of Hen. the 7. of England.
and apparently discerned what he had lost by his parcimony, endeavored to
make amends to his Kingdom, and people, calling hither Sebastian Cabot, also a
skillful Pilot, Genoes giving him both encouragement, honors, and employment;
but the issue of his endeavors did not answer that Kings expectation, though
after his life the same was prosecuted in King Henry the eighth's days with
various success.

And though Margaret Countess of Flanders did, in envy to him, set up Perkin
Werbeque to disturb the peace of England, and that that mock Prince came at
length to be a Scullion in his Kitchen; yet that wise Prince found another
more noble revenge to himself, and more profitable to his people, by settling
here the Manufactories of Clothing, and the strict prohibition of the
Exportation of English wools, which cost him (...) two years, (as I have been
informed) near one hundred thousand pounds, a mighty mass of moneys, the
Prince and times considered: but England soon found the benefit thereof; Anno
1515.
for in Anno 1515. the English having removed their staple from Bridges to
Antwerpe, where the aforesaid Kings of Portugal had then settled their
Contractors, for the vent of their new gained East-Indian spices, it was noted
by those Registers of Commerce kept in that place, and left to posterity by
Guicciardin, that has written their Chronicle, that the English Company of
Merchant-adventurers did bring thither clothing to the sum of, which was in
value 9. of 15. parts of all the other commodities and wares brought thither of
all other the nations whatsoever.

What a brave design Edward the sixth his Grandchild had, Of Edward the 6.
for the settling of sundry staples for that and other commodities in England,
and how that by reason of the then poverty of his Merchants, he intended, upon
security, to lend them out of his Treasury great sums for the effecting
thereof; I have briefly touched before, and for conclusion of this point, look
a little into Queen Elizabeth's days, Of Queen Elizabet^.
who though she was ever accompanied with state affairs of mighty consequence,
sometimes at home, and sometimes abroad; yet was she ever so careful to set
forward traffike, and encourage Navigators, that both Earls, Lords, Knights,
Gentlemen, and of every degree, willingly thrust themselves in search of new
traffikes and adventures, and to her days are we beholding for the trades of
Barbary and Italy, and other places, and for the discoveries of Turkey, Egypt,
India, Russia, Muscovia, and Greenland, and the trades settled by the English
therein; which has since found such fortunate success, to the benefit of our
now happy Sovereign, and his Crowns, that the customs were in her time, some
years before her death, farmed but at fourteen thousand pounds, which Smith,
commonly called Customer Smith, Customs increased in 50. years in England,
from 14 to 500. thousand pounds a year.
in one year petitioned for relief, as having been a loser thereby, and now
in less then fifty years is come to five hundred thousand pounds yearly, if
report gain credit to the Kings purse; and how much more the Farmers have made
thereof, His Majesty's custom books can best manifest. Princes that have
gained traffike must be careful to preserve it.
If then Princes of all ages, and the wisest of all Princes, have made it part
of their study, and have in many occurrences prejudiced themselves, and their
estates, to win this so excellent a benefit, how careful need all Princes to
be when the same is brought to perfection, to preserve and cherish it, and not
to suffer the liberties of their Merchants to be incroached upon, the freedom
of their traffike, to be fettered by heavy imposts, customs, and Innovations,
which are like Cankers that do insensibly eat out and ruin a trade before
the Prince, or the wisest of his Counselors, can see how to prevent or remedy
it.

The want of this care, Towns that have lost their traffike by want of care
and good order.
and provident foresight has lost many kings the traffike of their Kingdoms,
which were the best Jewels of their Crowns, and the richest flower in their
Diadems: The want of good orders in the government of the trade of Antwerpe,
Antwerpe.
and the imposing of heavy customs upon the Merchants there trading, has
within this fifty years brought that Town to the lowness wherein now we see
it. Lions.
Lions in France has suffered wonderfully by the same inconveniences; Marsilia.
and Marsilia within the days of my knowledge had a wonderful great traffike
for many places of Turkey, Barbary, Spain, and other kingdoms, and was then
able to show many ships employed in merchandise, carrying thirty and forty
pieces of Ordnance and now which is not above 24. in 25. years past, the best
of their vessels have not above ten pieces, and of those but very few neither.

English East India trade.
Here I could also particularize, the fetters Encroachments, and Intrusions
that have within these late years been laid upon the East India traders of
England, and their liberties, and what they have suffered both abroad and at
home, by the ill wishers of their prosperity; but what will it avail them, or
benefit our country, to travel into the disturbations, crosses and
afflictions, which they have, to their prejudice, felt, and to their loss
suffered? It suffices me here to say, that the want of due and timely
protection, and encouragement from the Estate, has reduced them to that bad
point, and low pass, wherein we now observe them to be; and that for the
future erecting of such a brave society, a great deal of time, and money must
be expended, and many larger immunities then formerly must be granted, ere the
same can be reduced to that pristine flourishing estate we lately have beheld
it to be in.

I could also here, Turk, and Moscovia Company in England.
by way of addition, say somewhat of those disturbances, that the Turkey,
Moscovia, and other Companies of London have groaned under; but I trust the
goodness of our Sovereign, and the wisdom of his Counselors, will rectify
the same, or remunerate them by fitting encouragements some other ways; lest
thereby the same be reduced to the present condition of the East India Company,
to His Majesty's great loss and dishonor, and to the wonderful prejudice of
his people and kingdoms.

Now, having thus handled the 3. first considerations of trade, and observed
that neither natural nor artificial commodities of a kingdom can enrich a
country without the help and hand of traffike; and then showed what
commodities by a well ordered traffike, a Kingdom must suffer entrance, and
what prohibit, and what again to send out, and also what to forbid, and
withal showed the particular means and ways that Princes are observed to use
to gain, settle, preserve, and augment the same with the laborious and
studious courses that have been taken by sundry late Princes to obtain and
purchase this so beneficial a commodity: I come now to the last point and
consideration before mentioned, wherein the rest is for the most part
comprehended, The reasons that do move Princes to covet trade in their
Kingdoms.
being the reasons and causes that move all estates, Kings and Empires to covet
the same, which I may say does extend it self into four heads and principal
parts.

1 Honorable.
The first is, that traffike with foraine nations is notable in respect of the
honor and reputation thereof.

2 Rich.
Secondly, excellent in point of riches, both to the King, his Country, and
Subjects.

3 Strong.
Thirdly, eminent in regard of strength offensive, and defensive, that it
brings with it to the Country and Princes where it is orderly managed; and
regularly practiced by skillful Merchants.

First then, Ttraffike is honorable to the people and country.
a well governed traffike, practiced in a Kingdom, by judicious and expert
Merchants, to foraine and remote countries will easily be granted, and
confessed to be both honorable, and of singular reputation, both to the
Sovereign in his particular, and to the nation in general. I need not seek
far for examples, nor search much for arguments to make this good and
manifest, but only look upon this our kingdom wherein we live. How had ever
the name of the English been known in India, Experienced in the English.
Persia, Moscovia, or in Turkey, and in many places elsewhere, had not the
traffike of our Nation discovered and spread abroad the fame of their
Sovereign Potency, and the renown of that peoples valor and worth? Many
parts of the world had, peradventure even to this day, lived in ignorance
thereof, and never dreamt of the inhabitants of so small an Island, had not the
traffike of the Merchants by Navigation made it famous over all those remote
Regions.

And in the Portugal and Hollander.
Nay, the Portugals, and Hollanders, an obscure people, in comparison of the
English, and enjoying but a handful of those subjects, that are comprehended
under the Scepter of great Britain, have by this only means given witness
and good testimony, to many powerful remote nations, of their countries worth
and honor.

What brought the Portugal nation to to be famoused in Africa and Asia, or
the Spanish name to be notable in America, but her traffike and Commerce.

The commerce, and not the conquests of the English have made them famous in
India.
It is not our conquests, but our Commerce; it is not our swords, but our
sayls, that first spread the English name in Barbary, and thence came into
Turkey, Armenia, Moscovia, Arabia, Persia, India, China, and indeed over and
about the world; it is the traffike of their Merchants, and the boundless
desires of that nation to eternize the English honor and name, that has
enduced them to sail, and seek into all the corners of the earth. What part is
there unsearched, what place undiscovered, or what place lies unattempted by
their endeavors, and courageous undertakings? most of which has been
accompanied with such fortunate success, League contracted by the English
Merchants with foraine Princes.
that they have contracted Leagues and Amity with the Mogull, Persian, Turk,
Moscovite, and other mighty foraine Princes in their Sovereigns name, and to
his honor; which even in our Fathers days was not known to us, either to
have any such condition, or being the Merchants of England. And to speak truth
of London, maintaining now at their charge an Agent in Moscovia, an Ambassador
and three Consuls in Turkey, and certain Presidents and Agents also in India,
Persia, and many other places thereof, which by computation cannot cost them
less then one hundred thousand pounds yearly (which though it may At their
own charge 100000. l. yearly.
be alleged is for their own profit, and the benefit of their traffike into
these parts) yet for as much as that it is not chargeable to their Sovereign,
nor prejudicial, but profitable to his Kingdoms, it must be granted that the
same brings honor to his name, and a great benefit both to him and his
subjects; and it is more then can be paralleld in all other Christian or
heathen Countries now in the world.

The Danes, Sweeds and Germans not known in India, etc.
The Danes and Swedish nations are potent, and the French are yet more
powerful in Europe; yet if you travel into India, Persia, and many of those
Eastern Kingdoms of the world, they know of no such people, Kings or
Countries, but hold all Europe to be inhabited by the Portugals, English and
Dutch; nay the French are hardly known in Moscovia and Russia, save by name,
but not by their worth or actions; and the Emperor of Germany, the greatest of
our Christian Princes, for all his eminence and power in Christendom, is not
in India, known, no nor yet in Persia, save for some leagues, which the Sophy
would sometimes have contracted with him, to the prejudice of Turkey, and the
Ottoman Empire.

So that by what has been said, the Commerce of Merchants, though many times
it be accompanied with loss and prejudice to themselves, and estates, and that
they are enforced to expose their fortunes to the mercy of merciless storms
and tempests, and be subject to the Laws of Heathenish Princes, and groan
under the heavy customs of many Sovereigns and Infidels; yet is it still
attended upon with a great deal of honor to their own Prince, and reputation
to his subjects: Therefore I will conclude here this point, that a well ordered
traffike managed by skillful Merchants, has been, and ever will be,
honorable to that Kingdom and Sovereign, where the same is duly practiced,
and carefully protected, and preserved. 2. Traffike is excellent in point of
Riches, tw^ ways.


The second point is in regard of Riches, and the benefit that traffike
brings with it, where the same is preserved with fitting privileges, and
practiced with regular order and method; and this Riches extends it self two
ways.

1 To the King and his Nobles.
In the first place to the Sovereign, his Nobles and Gentry, in the particular
of their own estates and Interests.

2 To his people.
Secondly to his subjects, the inhabitants in general; As to the Seamen,
Husbandmen, Artificers, Laborers, and others.

How it inricheth the King.
First for the Prince, or Sovereign, it particularly inricheth him by his
customs and imposts, imposed inwards, and outward upon all commodities and
wares, either imported or exported, in or out of his Kingdoms and Dominions,
by the Merchant, and also by venting, and dispersing of such wares, and
merchandises, as he appropriateth to himself, either by purchase,
prerogative, or by right of his Crown; as we find it to do by the Gabell of
Bay Salt, to the King of France, by the property of silk to the King of
Persia, by the Mines of Copper to the grand Signior, and by the preemtion of
Tyn to His Majesty of England, How the Nobility.
and next it proves beneficial to the Nobility and Gentry, by the improvement
of their lands, by the sale and working of their clothes, by the use of their
Timber, by the vent of their Cattle, Grain, and other provisions, and in many
regards, which experience daily makes evident, both in this, and all other
Kingdoms where the same is practiced.

Secondly, How the country.
it inricheth the inhabitants of a country in the general, by setting
Arts-men on work, by employing the poor, by furthering and encouraging of all
professions whatsoever; for every Arts-man, Worke-man and Artificer, is
conducible one way or other to traffike, and every hand is set on work, where
a well governed Commerce is observed to be driven, and exercised by judicious
and skillful Merchants, and to the whole country in general it is found
beneficial by venting the native commodities of that land, as experience tells
us, in Persia by the vent of their raw silks, in France by the vent of their
Wines, Oils, Lynens, Grain, etc. in Zante by the vent of their Corrence, in
Spain by the vent of their Wines, Fruits, Sugars, etc. and in England by the
vent of their Tin, Cloth, Lead, etc. as the like may be said of many other
countries.

3. Traffike produces strength two ways.
Thirdly and lastly, it produces strength and safety to the Kingdom and
people, where the same is duly and orderly practiced.

That which begets wealth, also does beget strength.
Now this strength and safety may be considered two ways; either defensive or
offensive: if my former assertions be granted, That a well ordered trade does
enrich a Prince, his nobles, gentiles and Subjects, as of necessity it must, it
will be easy for me to make good this point also; for that which produces
Riches, does consequently also beget strength and safety, so far forth as
treasure is accounted the principal nerve and sinnew of war, either offensive,
or defensive; but to come to some particulars

It furnishes the Prince, How traffike does beget strength.
and his subjects, having maritime ports, with plenty of shipping, and store of
Mariners, to manage and sail the same, in all occasions of the state and
country by sea* and it furnishes the same with all fitting Ammunition of and
for war, as Powder, Arms, and other the like necessaries; and by land it
makes the country a Magazine, not only for warlike provisions, brought in for
the use of the Prince, and the Kingdom it self, but also for all other
neighboring countries that stand in need thereof.

I may here fitly bring in Holland to make good this point to all the world, An
excellent plo^ of the Hollanders to inr^ch themselves.
who, though exercised in continual warfare, and daily pressed, and sometimes
oppressed by a potent Enemy; yet their industrious traffike into Foreign parts,
is handled and practiced with so much benefit, countenanced from the State and
good Judgment, that the same does not only supply their own occasions, with
what warlike provisions they want, but withal have thereof in such abundance,
that from their own states they furnish freely all other neighboring
countries whatsoever therewith; for the Arts-men that are by them employed
daily, in building of ships, casting of Artillery, making of Muskets, shot,
powder, swords, pikes, corslets, cordage, Canvas, and the like Habiliments of
war, do not only supply their own turns, and necessities, and that both
cheap and plentiful; but herein proceed so far, contrary to the politic
Rules of many countries, that they sell, and vent their overplus; yea even to
the Spaniards their very enemies conceiving it, no ill trick of thrift, nor yet
small point of State-stratagem, to draw thus the moneys and wealth of their
greatest adversaries to be a reward to their own labor and industry, and so
sell as it may be said (for moneys to their foes) the very sword, which
peradventure may aftewards be employed in the cutting of their own throats,
but being instruments considerable, and which must necessarily be had in war,
and which will be by their enemies had elsewhere for moneys, if not of them,
they choose rather thus to sell them, and so by permitting an unusual policy of
state, endeavor for their moneys to give them with their own consents, and
that voluntarily, and of their own accord, what they cannot with their best of
policy otherwise prevent, and what their enemies will be furnished withal,
in despite of their utmost endeavors elsewhere.

I need not insist further upon this point, having declared the honor,
benefit, and strength, both offensive and defensive, which does arise to a
Commonwealth or Country by a well ordered traffike, managed by Regular and
Judicious Merchants, I could here add to what I have said before in the
behalf of the Merchant, and show that as he can in many things advance his
country before a mere Statesman, so also declare the Nobility of his art,
and the excellency of his profession, no one vocation in the world requiring a
more general knowledge, and inspection into all other professions then this
does; and withal make it appear, that he is the best of Commonwealths men,
both toward his Prince, and fellow subjects; and that for the most part all
other professions live, and have their subsistence from others, he only
giving by traffike a livelihood to others, and no way dependent, but upon
himself, and his own labor and endeavors; as it will easily appear to any
judicious man that shall examine his profession, and compare the same with
others.

But I will conclude this discourse, and take it by what has been said for
granted, as for a truth undeniable, That the excellency of a well ordered
traffike, is such and so singular, and the effects thereof so notably
beneficial to a kingdom, and in its self so admirable, and the discreet and
skillful Merchants endeavors so laudable, and his art so eminently honorable,
that it requires and duly challenges

A Royal Protection, and Real Encouragement from all Kings and Princes, a
fair respect from all Nobles, a love from all persons, and well wishes from
all those their Countrymen, that tender the Profit, Advancement and Honor,
both of the King and Country, etc.
