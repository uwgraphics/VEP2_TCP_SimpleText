Right Reverend Father in God, PETER Ld Bish. of Winton. On Thursday the 24th of
October, 1688.
November. 1. 1688.
This may be Printed.



ON Tuesday the 16th of this instant October, was fixed upon the Colledge-Gates
and Chappel-Doors, a Citation from the Bishop of Winton in Latin, (and not
injudiciously, for the Mother Tongue would have been fitter for Babes than
Scholars) to Re-call Dr. Hough, the former Fellows, Demies, etc. by the second
of November following; which Citation was guarded by Robert Gardner, late
Porter, who, as he first left the College, so he first returned to it. But
this Citation, together with the Bishops Mind, being altered, according to a
second Information, he their Restorer as well as Visitor, was sooner Received,
viz. on Saturday, October the 20th, no doubt for his Masters sake) more like
the King than his Representative; which gave so great Satisfaction to the
People, that their Joy ran over, the Music of the Bells being outdone by Humms
and Huzzahs. Thus being attended by more than Three Hundred Gentlemen on
Horseback, and in several Coaches, as also by an innumerable company of
Spectators on foot, from Magdalen-Colledge to his Lodgings at St. John^, he
received his first general Salute.

But this Sunshine was soon Eclipsed; for the next morning by Seven of the
Clock, he was Remanded by an Express, to wait upon and pay a Visit to his
Majesty. This was very pleasing to some Roman Catholics, who, what the^ (...),
easily believed, viz. That the King had recall^d the Comm^, as well as the
Commissioner.

But on Wednesday following, we were well satisfied, that the King had more
Kindness for Our Church, than to answer Their Expectation; on which day (having
before paid his Obedience to the King) he privately surprised, and condescended
again to Visit Us.

On Thursday the 24th of October, about Ten in the Morning, he made his first
Visit to Magdalen College, the President, Fellows, Demies, etc. attending
upon, and answering him in their Formalities. At his entrance into the Quire,
having heard an Excellent Congratulary Speech from Dr. Baily, performed Divine
Service; so devoting himself first to God, he proceeded to execute his Office
as Visitor; the Prologue of which was in short to this effect: That since His
Majesty of His Gracious Clemency was pleased to Commission Me to restore you
the former Proprietors of this Foundation; in obedience to this Command, I am
come to reinstate you accordingly, resolving to do it Legally and Statutably.

From the Chapel they were adjourned to the Hall, where his Lordship, not
without great Applause, made an incomparable Speech, a very seasonable Piece of
Advice, consisting chiefly of Loyalty and Unity; by which he merited as great a
Trophy for his Learning, as he did before for his Courage.

Then calling for the College Statute-book, the Statute for Visitation was
read; after which calling for the Buttery-book, and tearing out the last Weeks
Names of the Roman Catholic Fellows, etc. he gave Orders to Re-inscribe all
the old ones, except Mr. Charnock and two Demy's, who were preferred since to
other Fellowships. Then calling them over in order, his Lordship published and
declared Dr. Hough to be the Head or President, and the rest the True, Legal,
and Statutable Members of that Foundation, and none others: For which good
Service Dr. Hough, one who might plead the best Desert, as well as Propriety,
to this Presidentship, in behalf of the rest, returned his Lordship a handsome
Complement, in a short but pithy Speech.

From hence his Lordship was conducted to the Visitor's Lodgings, where was
provided a splendid Entertainment; Dr. Hough thereby showing ^o great Respect
to the King's Commissioner, as he could have done to himself.

In the Evening the Bells expressed the Peoples Satisfaction: Bonfires in the
Town added great Pomp to this Celebration.

Having now bid Farewell to Magdalen College, his Lordship was on Friday and
Saturday at Corpus Christi, New College, and Trinity, who paid their Respect
to him in three splendid Entertainments. Upon Sunday he was entertained with
two University Sermons, a Repast for his Soul, as the others for his Body. The
next Morning he departed homewards, having received ample Testimony of the
Universities Loyalty and Generosity.

Clarks, Servants, and Choristers of Magdalen-Colledge, as they now stand Entered
