The Catholic Ballad: OR AN INVITATION TO POPERY, Upon considerable Grounds
and Reasons.
To the Tune of 88.
Since Popery of late is so much in debate,
And great strivings have been to restore it,
I cannot forbear openly to declare,
That the Ballad-makers are for it.
We Will dispute no more, these Heretical men
Have exposed our Books unto laughter,
So that many do say, 'twill be our best way
To sing for the Cause hereafter.
O the Catholic Cause! now assist me my Muse,
How earnestly do I desire thee!
Neither will I pray to St. Bridget to day,
But only to thee to inspire me.
Whence should purity come, but from Catholic Rome?
I wonder much at your folly:
For St. Peter was there, and left an old Chair,
Enough to make all the world holy.
For this sacred old wood is so excellent good,
If Tradition may be believed,
That whoever sits there needs never more fear
The danger of being deceived.
If the Devil himself should (God bless us) get up
Though his nature we know to be evil,
Yet whilst he sat there, as diverse will swear,
He would be an infallible Devil.
Now who sits in this Seat, but our Father the Pope?
So that here is a plain demonstration,
As clear as noonday, we are in the right way,
And all others are doomed to damnation.
If this will not suffice, yet to open your eyes,
Which are blinded with bad Education;
We have Arguments plenty, and Miracles twenty
Enough to convince a whole Nation.
If you give but good heed, you shall see the Host bleed,
And if any thing can persuade ye,
An Image shall speak, or at least it shall squeak
In the honor of our Lady.
You shall see without doubt the Devil cast out,
As of old by E^ra Pater;
He shall skip about and tear like a dancing Bear
When he feels the Holy Water.
If yet doubtful you are, we have Relics most rare,
We can show you the sacred Danger;
Several loads of the Cross, as good as ere was
To preserve your souls from danger.
Should I tell you of all, it would move a stonewall,
But I spare you a little for pity
That each one may prepare, and rub up his ear,
For the second part of my D^tty.
The Second Part to the same Tune.
NOw listen again to those things that remain,
They are matters of weight, I assure you,
And the first thing I say, throw your Bibles away,
It Is impossible else for to cure you.
O that pestilent Book! never on it more look,
I wish I could speak it out louder:
It has don more men harm, I dare boldly affirm
Than the Invention of Guns and Powder.
As for matters of Faith, believe what the Church says,
But for Scripture, leave that to the Learned;
For these are edge tools, and you Laymen are fools,
If you touch them you are sure to be harmed.
But pray what is it for, that you make all this stir?
You must read, you must hear and be learned:
If you will be on our part, we will teach you an Art,
That you need not be so much concerned.
Be the Churches good son, and your work is half don,
After that you may do your own pleasure:
If your Beads you can tell, and say Ave Mary well,
Never doubt of the heavenly treasure.
For the Pope keeps the Keys, and can do what he please
And without all peradventure,
If you cannot at the fore, yet at the backdoor
of Indulgence you may enter.
But first by the way you must make a short stay
At a place called Purgatory,
Which the Learned us tell, in the buildings of Hell,
Is about the middlemost Story.
It Is a monstrous hot place and a mark of disgrace
In the torment on it long to endure:
None are kept there but fools and poor pitiful souls
Who can no ready money procure.
For a handsome round sum you may quickly be gone,
For the Church has wisely ordein'd,
That they who build Crosses and pay well for Masses
Should not there be too long detein'd.
So that it is a plain case, as the nose on ones face,
We are in the surest condition,
And none but poor fools and some niggardly owls
Need fall into utter perdition.
What aileth you then, O ye great and rich men,
That you will not hearken to reason,
Since as long as you have pence, ye need scruple no offense,
Be it Murder, Adultery, Treason.
And ye sweet-natur'd Women, who hold all things common,
My addresses to you are most hearty,
And to give you your due, you are to us most true
And I hope we shall gain the whole party.
If you happen to fall, your Penance shall be small,
And although you cannot forgo it,
We have for you a cure, if of this you be sure
to confess before you go to it.
There is one reason yet, which I cannot omit,
To those who affect the French Nation,
Hereby we advance the Religion of France,
The Religion that is only in fashion.
If these reasons prevail, (as how can they fail?)
To have Popery entertained,
You cannot conceive, and will hardly believe,
What benefits hence may be gained.
For the Pope shall us bless (that is no small happiness)
And again we shall see restored
The Italian Trade, which formerly made
This Land to be so much adored.
O the Pictures and Rings, the Beads and fine things,
The good words as sweet as honey,
All this and much more shall be brought to our door
For a little dull English money.
Then shall Traffic and Love, and whatever can move
Be restored again to our Britain,
And Learning so common, that every old woman
Shall say her Prayers in Latin.
Then the Church shall bear sway, and the State shall obey,
Which is now looked upon as a wonder,
And the proudest of Kings and all temporal things
Shall submit and truckle under.
And the Parliament too, who have taken us to do
And have handled us with so much terror,
May chance on that score (it is no time to say more)
They may chance to acknowledge their error.
If any man yet shall have so little wit
As still to be refractory,
I swear by the Mass, he is a mere Ass,
And so there is an end of a Story.
FINIS.
