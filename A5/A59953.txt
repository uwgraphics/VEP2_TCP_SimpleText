A Few Words Concerning CONSCIENCE, WHAT IT IS; And what Estate it was in
before TRANSGRESSION. And how it became Darkened, Defiled and Corrupted; And
how again it may be Enlightened, Cleansed, Purified and set at Liberty, as it
was before Sin entered.

Intermixed with a few Words concerning Persecution among the diverse Sects in
Christendom (and upon the Face of all the Earth); showing, that they all arise
for Want of True Liberty of Conscience; and what that Liberty is.

A Few Words Concerning CONSCIENCE, What it is, etc.
COnscience is generally to be understood to be such a Being, Subject, Which
Capacity is as a Book, capable to contain what is written or imprinted therein;
and may be not only opened and shut, but blotted and stained also.
Faculty or Capacity in Mankind, which is wanting in all the Beasts of the
Field, Fish of the Sea, and Fowls of the Air; and in this Capacity Mankind
differs from and excels them all; being created in and endued with such a
Capacity, wherein and whereby he is enabled to participate of the Divine
Nature, and to partake of the Beams of its Glory, to Meditate Contemplate,
Consolate, Delight and Refresh himself in the Light, Law and Glory of his
Maker; which Capacity is not to be found in all the Elements of this World, but
only in Mankind.

Now, in the Beginning Man's Mind, Heart and Conscience was a Heavenly and pure
Receptacle, These Three are so inseparable, that that which defiles the One,
defiles the Other; and that which purifies the One, purifies the Other.
Tabernacle and Dwelling place for the Almighty; his Power, Wisdom, Light and
Glory was displayed therein, and Mankind was highly exalted thereby, above all
the Works of his hands. And while Mankind stood here in this High and Heavenly
Estate, The Blessed Estate of Man before the Fall.
he lived in the Paradise of God, enjoying the Light of his Countenance, and
had Unity with his Maker, and could behold his Face with Joy, and receive the
Reflections of the Beams of Divine Glory shining in his Conscience with
Delight, living in Dominion over all the Creation; his Conscience being Pure,
he held the Mystery of Faith in it, eying the Invisible God through, above and
beyond all things, visible and invisible.

This was the State of Mankind before the Fall, while his Conscience was Pure
and Undefiled; while he remained in that Estate God made him and placed him in,
who was a Pure, Innocent Subject, Holy in his Being, and Harmless in his
Nature, all within him and without him was Good, yea, very Good. Now, the
Wisdom is to understand, how that which was Holy and Harmless, Innocent, Pure
and Undefiled, did become Evil and Corrupted, seeing in this State and Time
Evil had not a Being, whence could or did the Temptations arise? The Wisdom of
all men living in the Fallen Defiled Estate cannot find out nor search into the
Depth of these things; The Mysteries of God are hid from the Wise and Prudent,
and revealed to Babes.
they are only revealed and made known by the shining of the same Light which
was in the Beginning, and gives the Children thereof to see to the same:
Therefore to the same Light and Spirit of God, which moved upon the Face of the
Waters, in the Beginning, before the Sun, Moon and Stars were created, or the
Mountains formed; which Light now shines in the Heart of Mankind (though
Darkness), which Light also God has caused to shine out of Darkness in the
Hearts of Thousands in this our Day and Age; I say, To this Light I chiefly
refer and commend thee, being indeed the Key of the Mysteries of God and
Godliness, yet a few Words for the sake of the Captivated, and for the opening
of that Eye that is blinded, that such may come to see and discern the Things of
God, and that the Enlightened may by seeing perceive how Mankind at first came
to make Shipwreck of Faith and a Good Conscience, and avoid doing the like.

Moses, or the Author of Genesis, was endued with an Excellent Spirit of Wisdom
and Discerning, when he comprised the History of the Creation, and the State of
Mankind therein; and indeed I must tell my Reader, That nothing short of a
Measure of the same Spirit and Divine Wisdom can lead thee into a True
Discerning and Understanding of the same; Nothing skort of the Inspiration of
the Almighty gives a True Understanding of the things of his Kingdom.
he has exposed the Shell, but has locked up the Kernel from the Prudent Wit
and Comprehension of Man under diverse Similitudes and Hieroglyphics; thou
may read the History, and walk in the Field of the Creation, yet if thou
diggest not deep, and find the Pearl, and purchase it, and like a Wise Merchant
Man sell All for it, thou will be ignorant of the Mystery, and remain Poor,
Blind and Miserable; for I intend not to throw Pearls before Swine, neither
dare I (like Hezekiah) show the Treasures of the Lord's House to the
Babylonians, lest both I and it are carried into Captivity therefore.

Now, its said, They were both Many Carnal Conceits and Imaginations are and
have been at Work among Men to Understand these things, but they have not come
to the Opening of the Seals, nor to the Key of the Mysteries of God, and so
have divulged their own Carnal and Lucifrian Conceptions, Comprehensions, and
Notions for the Divine Knowledge of God; and many have thereby grown Rich, Tall
and Great in Brain and Head-Knowledge; but Poor, Low and Small in Experimental
Heart Understanding, and of the Work of God therein.
Naked, the Man and his Wife, and were not ashamed: There was then No Cause of
Shame in being, no Temptation entered into, no Sin committed, which is the Cause
of Shame. And its also said, The Serpent was more subtle then all the Beasts of
the Field which God had made: Now God made nothing but what was Good, keeping
in its State and Bounds, wherein God had set and appointed them, would so have
remained; But there being a possibility to break those Bounds, and disobey that
Law that God had set over them, God gave Mankind A Warning thereof, and
acquainted him with the Penalty thereof also, that in the Day he did it, he
should Dye the Death.

Now Mankind had Faith in his Maker, and in his Conscience found himself bound
to obey the Command given him, and had Strength to resist the Temptation, These
Things are to be seen and known in the Light, and Wisdom of God, beyond what
Words can express.
till the Woman (the weaker Vessel) believed a Lie, and looked upon the Beauty
of the Thing presented, and let up a Desire to be wise, and to know good and
evil, and to be as Gods; so in this Hope of gaining and bettering their Estate,
became subject unto * Vanity, and hereby the Light that shined in the Heart and
Conscience became veiled, Romans 8.20.
and the Image and Glory of God that appeared therein, Every particular within
themselves must come to know the Loss and full Crucifixion, and Death of the
one, and the Life and Resurrection of the other, before Restoration can be
known.
became lost as the Image of the Selfish Will and Desire rose up, and became
prevalent, the Image of God declined, and departed; and when man lost his
Faith, which was held in the pure Conscience, The same befalls Mankind at this
Day when they loose their Anchor.
which Faith was as an Anchor, by which Conscience as a Ship in a Storm was
stayed for a while, from being made a wrack; I say when he lost this Faith in
the Word and Command of God, and believed the Serpent's Lies, he soon made
Shipwreck of both: and no sooner were their own Eyes opened, but the Eye and
Light of God, which shined in them became stopped, and veiled, and they lost
the Glory and Benefit of it; no sooner their own Wisdom and Knowledge sprung
up; but the Wisdom of God departed, and Innocence the heavenly Clothing became
lost, and Nakedness appeared, Faith and a good Conscience destroyed, Shame,
Guilt, Fear and Hiding the Effects of it succeeded: So though Conscience in its
primitive Estate was Pure, Clean and Undefiled, The same Danger is still, even
among such as are presented as a Chaste Virgin to Christ, and have attained to
an innocent Sinless Estate, and a Dewlling Place in Paradise; therefore the
Duty of all such is to watch and pray, that they enter not into Temptation, and
are beguiled as the Serpent did Eve.
yet was liable and capable to be corrrupted, darkened and defiled, even as the
Mind departed from a due Regard and obedience of the Law and Command of God,
and slighted his Light and Glory, which shined, and illuminated his Heart and
Conscience; then Clouds of Error, and Mists, and Fogs of Self-will thoughts and
Imaginations soon arose, and darkened the pure Air, and ecclipsed the Glory of
that Sun, that before shined in him, and drew a vail before the Light of God's
Countenance, Genesis 3.10.
which to behold was his Joy, and Delight; now become his Fear and Terror, now
a Night come over him, and he runs in the Darkness thereof to hide himself
among the Trees of the Garden from the Presence of God; this was the Way and
Work of the first Adam in the Beginning, and his Children are found in the same
at this Day upon the Face of the whole Earth, he that reads let him
understand.

Now when this noble Part or Capacity in Man is thus clouded, and darkened, and
defiled through Disobedience to the Law of his God, he then goes astray more
and more, corrupts himself through his Imaginations and Inventions more and
more, and according to that he entertaineth and joins himself to; so becomes
even Darkness and a Child of it: 1 Cor. 6.16, 17.
And of the most excellent, and best Part of the Creation becomes the worst,
and the principallest Instrument in the Hand of the wicked One to lead, even
Nature it Self, out of its Course, and to burden, oppress, corrupt and abuse
all Things under his Power, verifying that Maxim among Men, The best of things
being corrupted become the worst.

Now in this Degenerate, Fallen, Clouded, Darkened and Corrupted Estate the Sun
of Righteousness, and holy Principle of Light, which at first shined clear in
the Conscience Though Mankind fell from and lost the Light and Glory of God,
yet that in it self remained the same, and became his Judge and Reprover, which
before was his Comforter.
remains in it self the same, pure and undefiled, and does glance forth its
Eternal Beams of Light into this Darkness, and gives Mankind in that Estate
some Sense and Knowledge of their Lost, Degenerated, Corrupted, Miserable
Estate; and in the Cool of the Day calls Transgressing Man to an Account, as it
did Adam and Cain, and convinces them of their Evil Deeds, and calls to a
Repentance or Returning again into the same Way he went out of, even by the
Help and Guidance of that Light and Holy Spirit which at first shined in his
Heart and Conscience, wherein he enjoyed the Light of God's Countenance, and
walked and lived in his Presence without Rebuke. But being Departed,
Degenerated and Turned in his Mind from the Good into the Evil, from the Glory
and Light that once shined in him, and and was pleasant for his Eye to behold,
into Sin and Transgression; he is by it pursued, reproved and convinced, in
order to turn him back again: And whosoever hearkens to this Reproof, and
obeyes the Spirit of Truth, The Way to Paradise and a Undefiled Estate again.
which convinces of Sin, and loves the Hand that smites them, and submits
to the same, shall come to witness and enjoy the Undefiled, Regenerate, Happy
Estate again, and enter in through the Gate into the City and Paradife of God
again. But he that hates the Reproofs thereof, and rebels against the Spirit,
and humbleeth not himself under the Mighty Hand of God, which smites for
Transgression, goes forward into utter Darkness, stumbles and falls, and rises
no more to the Resurrection of Life and Felicity, but is filled with Fear, and
encompassed with Terrors round about, upwards and downwards, nothing but
Tribulation, Anguish and Vexation of Spirit attends Mankind in this Estate,
wherein his chief Companions are a Guilty Defiled Conscience,
wherein are written Grievous Things against him, and a Wounded Spirit, a
Burden too heavy for Cain to bear; though but the Fruit of his own Doings, and
the Crop of his own sowing

Now, in this State of Loss, Misery and Bondage, wherein the Heart and
Conscience is defiled and Corrupted, there is great Working and Contriving in
the minds of Mankind how to find that again which is lost, and how to be
delivered from the Misery and Bondage wherein he is fallen; and this is the
Nature of all Mankind in the Fall to seek out many Inventions, and to go down
to Egypt for Help, and to walk by the Light of his own Fire, and the Sparks
that he has kindled, and in the crooked Ways of his own finding out, and to
reject the Help, Counsel and straight Way of the Lord; he being darkened and
deceived, and the Light of Christ in his Conscience veiled, he ever did and
does at this day, in that Estate, take one thing for another, viz. Degenerate
man in all Ages ever was Mistaken, and always took one thing for another; Good
for Evil, and Evil for Good; Light for Darkness, and Darkness for Light, etc.
which Mistake is the Ground of all Error and Mischief in the World in matters
of Religion.
Good for Evil, and Evil for Good, Light for Darkness, and Darkness for Light,
etc. And being thus far deceived, exalts and sets up the one for the other, so
when he has found out a Way and Worship that likes him, and sewed something
together, though but leaves, he will endeavor to cover his Nakedness
therewith, and to hide himself from the Wrath that is revealed in him, and
awakened against him, and when he has invented a Medicine to cure his
Sickness, and a Salve to heal his Wound, though deceitfully, and found Mortar
to daub up the Breach, though it be untempered, his Conscience being darkened,
and his Heart deceived, he will plead Conscience for the Use of the same and
sets them up as the only Remedies to be found, etc. So natural is it for
degenerate Man to worship the Works of his own hands, and to follow the
Inventions, Conceiveings, Thoughts and Imaginations of his own corrupt Heart,
and yet calls it the Way of the Lord, and if any of his Neighbors, or Brethren
come to hear and obey the Voice of God, and to follow the Light, and Guidance
of his Spirit, and to find Acceptance with him, and refuses in a good
Conscience to God to follow his direction, The Cause of Cain's Anger against
his Brother, or the Wicked against the Righteous in this Age.
and to make Use of his invented Means, and to bow down and worship the Image
he has set up, then Envy and Hatred arises, and Violence breaks forth, and
Blood touches Blood, even because such will not, nor cannot for Conscience
sake, see, and say, and do as he does; bow to his Image and Invention, and
worship as he does, though he finds not Acceptance of God, nor the Light of his
Countenance toward him in his Worship, no more then Cain that Religious
Murderer did, whose Offering was the Fruit of that Ground that is cursed, which
never did, nor never will bring forth Fruit well-pleasing to God: And it is
from Mankind laboring in this Ground (being driven out of the Paradise and
Garden of God) that all the Diversity of Opinions, Notions, The Rise of
Opinions, and the Cause of Cruelty, and Persecution about them.
Conceivings, Thoughts, Imaginations and Contrvances, Forms and Fashions of
invented Worship upon the Face of the whole Earth springs and arises, and
all the Envy, Hatred, Cruelty, Bloodshed, Compelling Forceing and Persecution,
about Fashions of Worship and Religion among all the Sects in Christendom
arises from this Ground, and all that are found in the Work thereof (though
they may pretend Conscience, and Zeal to God, and the Maintenance of the
Gospel, and the Good of Souls) are of the Spirit of Cain the first Murderer
about Religion, and his Reward they will find measured into their own Bosoms
from the Hand of God.

Now the diverse Sects, and formal Worshippers in Christendom, are ready to
stand up plead, and contend for their Forms and Invention, and Way and Manner
of Worship, and also cry out for Liberty of Conscience in their Way, and for
the Practice of their Fashion in Worship, and will also in their Infancy cry
out against Persecution; Every Selfish private narrow Spirit Sect and Opinion,
though in its Rise may pretend otherwise has Persecution at the Bottom.
when they want only Number; Power and Strength to persecute themselves, which
when they attain unto, and their Horns grow strong, and get Crowns upon them,
they will, and have been found doing the same Work, as might be demonstrated at
large; but being obvious to the Observation of the Judicious, and intending
Brevity, I forbear; and indeed they can do no otherwise, being of a private,
narrow, self-conceited Spirit, ignorant of the true Liberty of Conscience,
which Liberty stands not in this or that, or the other invented Form or Fashion
of Worship, Conceiving or Opinion; but in the Light and Power of God, which
every particular Man and Woman upon the Face of all the whole Earth ought to
know, and experience enlightening and ruling in his Conscience, and Conscience
can never enjoy its true Liberty till it come into this Estate.


The Consciences of Men are generally weak, darkened defiled, corrupted,
vitiated, (and which is worst of all, some who have lost the Day of their
Visitation, are seared as with an hot Iron) and in this State have a Bond and
Tie upon their Consciences, which ought to be broken, and cast off, till which,
they are liable to make Conscience of such Things they ought not; as might be
instanced through all Sects, both among Indians, Turks, Jews and Titular
Christians, and the Evils and Mischiefs that ensue from hence are very many.

Conscience in the State above,
is the great Troubler of the World of Mankind, and the Evils that are brought
forth and committed, under the Notion, Pretense and Seal of Conscience, are
Evils of the greatest Magnitude.

Now nothing under Heaven is able to rectify the Conscience, enlighten,
cleanse, and purify, and redeem it into true Liberty; but the Light and Power
of God, shining and operating in the Conscience, as it did before Transgression
entered, What alone is able to bring Liberty of Conscience.
before Sin was committed, and before Opinion, Invention, dark Thoughts and
Imaginations sprung up; this alone is able to purge and cleanse the Conscience,
from Darkness and dead Works, and make it an undefiled Habitation for God
again, as it was in the Beginning; this is the State wherein Liberty of
Conscience is known and enjoyed, even when Man comes to have his Conscience
exercised in,
and ruled and governed by the Light, Spirit and Power of God, then man's Heart
becomes his Throne, and he sits and rules therein, and that which usurped it,
is cast down and the Prince of the Air, which got his rule and place there by
Disobedience, is cast out.

And all those that come not to know this brought to pass within themselves,
nor are not in the Way, that leads thereto, are but of a private selfish
Opinion and Sect; though (as above) while they are little and low, and small in
Number, they may plead for Liberty of Conscience, and cry against Persecution,
Force, Imposition and Violence about Religion; yet when their Opinion
prevails, and the Horns thereof grow strong thereby they will push toward the
East, West, North and South, and will smite their Fellow Servants; and as I
have said before, it can be no otherwise then so, until man comes to know the
universal Light and Spirit of God to shine and rule in his Conscience,
and establish it in perfect Liberty, and Love to the whole Creation of God,
and to all the Works of his Hands, and in Obedience to all his holy
Commandments; in this stands the perfect Liberty of Conscience.

Now for want of this the Titular Christians of all Sorts and Sects, are so
wedded to their private and selfish Opinions, Traditions, Notions, Conceptions,
Apprehensions, Comprehensions, Thoughts and Imaginations about Religion, Church
and Worship, and matters relating to Conscience, that they envy, hate, bite and
devour one another about them. One will persecute about his Mass Book and
Sacrament of the Altar another about his Common Prayer Book, Maintenance and
Church Discipline, another about his Directory: another about his Church-Faith
and Agreement of the Assembly of Divines (so called) and about Bread and Wine,
and Water, Days and Times, and other outward Things: They will quarrel with
tear and devour one another, and all like so many ravenous Beasts will prey
upon the Sheep,
Ephraim against Manasses, and Manasses against Ephraim; but both against
Judith: Every Sect in Christendim, one against another, divided like the
Builderrs of Babel; yet all against the tender, meek, harmless, Lamb like
Spirit of Jesus in whomsoever it appears, that in all Ages since the Fall and
Apostasy grew up as a Lilly among Thorns, prik'd on every Side, A Thorn may
hurt a Lilly, but a Lilly cannot hurt a Thorn.
and as a Lamb among wolves, which though hurt and preyed upon, wants the very
Nature and Capacity of hurting again, or rendering Evil for Evil, even as an
outward Lilly does a Thorn, or a Lamb a Wolf.

So that this is an infallible Sign and Token, both of the one and the other,
of him whose Conscience is at Liberty to serve the Lord, and loves his whole
Creation, and is at Unity and Peace therewith: and of him who has his
Conscience bound under a private Opinion, corrupted and defiled with Envy,
Hatred and Evil-Will against his Brother, and Neighbor, about Matters of
Sacrifice, Religion, Faith and Worship And whoever thou art, and of what
Opinion soever thou art, hereby thou may measure and try thy self, and find
of what Generation and Stock thou art of, whether of the righteous, or the
wicked; whether thou art a Lilly or a Thorn, a Lamb or a Wolf; and whether thy
Conscience be at Liberty or bound: If thou find a Mind, Will or Inclination in
thee, An (...) Sign where Conscience (...) Liberty.
to Envy, Hate, Persecute and lay violent Hands like Cain, upon thy Brother and
Neighbor, thou may assure thy self, and infallibly know, that thy Conscience
is degenerated and defiled, and that thou art born of the Flesh, and that thou
art a Thorn, and no Lilly, a Wolf and no Lamb: And this Flesh thou art born of,
is the Flesh of the Whore the false Church, which has drunk the Blood of the
Saints, and Martyrs in all Ages; and this Whore thy Mother, has not only
nursed thee up; but made thee drunk with the Wine of her Fornication; and thou
art a Citizen of Mystery Babylon the great, and a Stranger to the beloved City
of God, and a hater of those, that dwell therein; notwithstanding thou may
have a golden cup of Profession, which thy Mother holds forth to the Nations;
yet thy Conscience is defiled and thy Heart corrupted, and so far darkened and
captivated under Bondage and strong Delusion, that notwithstanding thou
appearest like a Thorn, A perfect Sign of one that is made drunk with the Wine
of Fornication.
and in the Nature of a Wolf, hurting the Lilly, and worrying the Lamb; yet
thou thinks, thou art doing God good Service therein, being made so drunk with
the Whore's Cup, and blinded in thy superstitious Zeal, that thou takes the
Lilly for a Thorn, and the Lamb for a Wolf, and the Whore, thy Mother, for the
Lamb's Wife.

And now this is an infallible Sign where Liberty of Conscience is enjoyed,
where the Light, Love and Power of God rules in the Conscience; such if his
Brother or Neighbor has his Conscience in Bondage, A true infallible Sign
where Liberty of Conscienc is enjoyed
or is weak, being veiled and darkened so far as to believe a Lie, and to make
Conscience of doing that, which he ought not to do, whether it be to worship as
the Mass Book prescribes, or as the Common Prayer Book, Directory,
Church-Faith, Assembly of Divines (so called) or as any other invented Platform
of Religion Commands, I say he that has his Conscience truly enlightened,
and is a Christian indeed, does not hate and envy his Brother or Neighbor
therefore neither has he any evil Will toward him in, this Estate, and has
no more inclination to put forth his Hand against his Person, Life, Liberty or
Estate, because of his Conscientious Errors, and Religious Practices, then he
has against his own Life; but instead thereof, in the universal Love of God,
finds it his Duty to pity such in his Heart; and having obtained Liberty of
Conscience himself, and found the universal Medicine, which if applied is able
to cure all sick and feeble Minds, wounded Spirits, weak and distempered
Consciences, he is willing and ready to tell his Brother and Neighbor, what
the Lord has done for his Soul, and how and where he came to find the precious
Pearl, and to inform and instruct them how they may find the same, and exhort
and persuade them to receive and make use and trial of the same Medicine that
has cured him, though for this his Love and good Will, he meets with much
Exercise and Hardship from the ill-natured and Ignorant, and much Opposition
and Scorn from the selfish-wise and prudent; this was the Portion of the
righteous, and Ministers of the everlasting Gospel from the ungrateful World in
all Ages, * who were constrained in the Love of God to run to and fro among
them, The Work and End of the true Ministry.
that Knowledge might be enereased, and to warn Men to flee from the Wrath
which is to come; and knowing the Terrors of the Lord, persuaded Men to be
reconciled to God: Thus they did and do in Obedience to him, and Love to their
Souls (and not for Gold and Silver, and selfish Ends; but to discharge their
Consciences in the Sight of God) this has been the Labor of Love, and Travail
of the righteous in all Ages, who come to have their Consciences made tender,
and truly enlightened, cleansed, purified and set at Lberty from all that did
defile them; they never persecuted hated, hurt or destroyed any about Matters
of Conscience and Religion, though erroneous in their Opinions, and
superstitious in their Practices;
neither ought any to be troubled, vexed and ruined in their Persons,
Liberties, Lives and Estates because of those Things, especially when their
Opinions tend not to the Ruin, Hurt and Destruction of Mankind, and his outward
well being and humane Society:
But some such Opinions there are, which indeed are as Monsters in Nature,
destroying natural Affection, Violating the Bounds of Humanity, under the Cloak
and Pretense of Religion and Christianity; and some are so far besotted in
their Opinions, that they will plead Conscience for the Prosecution of them,
though thereby they lay waste the Property, Life and Liberty of Persons that
are of a contrary, or different mind and Judgment to them, though better livers
then themselves.

Now the End of all good Order and Government among Men, The End of Magistracy
and true Government.
is to preserve and defend their Properties, Liberties and Lives from the
Teeth, and Mouths of such as would spoil and rob them of either. And among all
the Beasts of prey this blind Zeal, misguided Conscience and dark selfish
Opinion is most ravenous, this Wolf in Sheeps Clothing has sharp Teeth and
cruel Claws, and a wild, untamed, devouring Spirit, notwithstanding his
pretense of Zeal and Conscience for the Christian Religion; it is the Spirit of
Cain and Saul, Blind Zeal, a defiled Conscience private selfish dark Opinions,
the Ground of diverse Massacries and much Blood shed in Christendom.
that Murderer and Persecutor about Sacrifice and Worship, which will be rising
up against his Brother and Neighbor; as it has been, so it is at this Day, he
that is born of the Flesh will persecute him that is born of the Spirit, etc.
But whosoever is led by his (religious or rather) irreligious Opinions to
endeavor the Hurt and Ruin of his Brother or Neighbor about matters of
Religion and Conscience; if he accomplish and effect the fame, he is an Evil
Doer, and ought to suffer as an Evil-Doer; and he that hoth Good Will to all,
and seeks the good of all, and hurts no man though he be of a contrary Mind and
Judgment to him, and of a defiled Conscience, and erroneous Opinions, he is the
Well-Door. And the Laws of God and all good Men, who are appointed to Rule for
God, are a Terror to the One, and a Praise and Encouragement to the Other: And
such brutish unnatural Opinionists, whose Consciences are not only darkened,
defiled and corrupted, but feared as with a hot Iron: who, under the Profession
of Christianity dare entertain and assert such Cruel Impious Tenets or
Opinions, as, that it is lawful to Destroy the Property, Liberty and Life of
Men about the Christian Religion; and to account all that conform not to his
Form and Fashion of Religion, Tradition and Invention no better then Weeds and
Vermin, Corrupt and Cankered Members, fit to be pulled up, cut off, burnt and
destroyed, where this Ravenons Beast is prevalent, as in some Countries beyond
the Seas, it destroys every Green Thing, this Spirit and Bloody Opinion is
hated of God and all Good Men, and is as a Monster risen out of the Bottomless
Pit, and as the great Apollyon, or Destroyer, to be chained and shut up therein
again: Oh God! hasten the Time thereof is the Breathing of the Righteous.

Oh! how Lamentable is it to consider what Work and Havoc this Spirit has
made under a Corrupt, Blind, Mis guided Conscience, and Ignorant Zeal,
especially in this Part of the World, called Christendom, about Church,
Religion and Worship, the Mind and Conscience (the best and noblest Capacity of
Man being in its primitive Estate) when darkened, defiled, corrupted, hardened
and seared, becomes the worst, even a Habitation for Devils, formed and
transformed like unto an Angel of Light; so that those that are not deceived
and ruled by the One, may be the Other: The Greatest and Strongest Poison of
Souls, Bodies, Lives, etc. of Men is in the Whore's Golden Cup; and all that
drink freely thereof (or are compelled thereto) are deeply infected therewith
And the Nations reel with the Wine of her Fornications.
But in all Ages the * transformed Devil, who assumeth the Form of Religion and
Profession of Godliness, has proved the greatest Deceiver, and the most Cruel,
as might be evidenced at large by his Work in this present Age, and throughout
the Records of many Generations.

But all that come to return in their Minds to the Light and Glory of God, The
Way out of all Selfish and Private Opinions and Cruelty about them, into
perfect Freedom and Liberty of Conscience.
which at first shined in the Heart and Conscience of Mankind, and made it a
fit Receptacle or Dewlling Place for himself, and believes, walks and abides in
the same, shall again come to know and live in the same Estate man enjoyed
before his Conscience was defiled, before the Vail came over his Heart and
Understanding, before the Image of God was lost, before any Place or Credit was
given to the Serpent's Lies; where true Liberty of Conscience was lived in, and
the Light of God's Countenance enjoyed, the Serpent ruled over, and the Earth
subdued, in the Paradise of God, The Light that now shines out of Darkness in
the Hearts of Thousands and Ten Thousands, leads not only into these things;
but farther into the Life and State of the second Adam, against whom the
Serpent never could nor shall prevail: And the God of Heaven and Earth, who
has caused or commanded it to shine, has the Praise and Glory thereof, both
now and for evermore.

Postscript.
SUch Opinions in Religion, which bind man's Conscience to seek and endeavor
the Hurt of his Brother or Neighbor, in his Name, Person, Liberty, Estate or
Life, because he does not believe and practice the same Manner and Form of
Worship as he does, are very Cruel, Unnatural and Unreasonable; First, Because
many times People come by their Opinions as Heirs come by their Estates
Hereditarily; if their Parents or Tutors were of this or that Sect of the Jews
or Mahumetans, their Children commonly are trained up and educated in the same;
if of one of the Sects among the Christians (so called), then commonly the
Child is trained and catechized in the same; and many Parents take as much Care
to leave their Children possessed of their Religious Opinions, as they do of
their Estates, as might be showed at large, both among Jews, Turks and
Christians. And in Christendom, the greatest Proof many have to prove
themselves Christians, is, that their Parents and Tutors were so called and
accounted, and they have received and walked in their Traditions, and conformed
to the Orders and Discipline of Holy Church (so called), and they believe as
the Church believes; and it is their Opinion, this is Christianity enough to
carry them to Heaven, many being bound in their Consciences by a traditional
implicit Faith to their Hereditary Christianity, or the Traditions of their
Forefathers, that they never Question their Way nor Title therein; they never
knew no other, nor better, nor dare not for Fear seek further, their
Consciences being bound under their private traditional Opinions and
Ceremonies: Now, that such should have their Bodies hurt, and their Lives
destroyed, and their Estates rent from them and their Posterity, because they
will not change and renounce their Opinions they have been bred up and educated
in, and conform to that Opinion and Form of Worship that has the Sword in its
Hand, and is become National in the Country where he lives, is both Cruel,
Unnatural and Unreasonable, whether he be Jew, Mahumetan, Christian, Papist or
Protestant.

2dly, Because no man is able to change his Own Mind in Religion when he
pleases, or when commanded, nor break those Chains of Tradition he has been
educated in from his Childhood; neither is he able to shake off those Bolts and
Fetters of Opinion, and change his Faith and Belief, when he pleases: For when
man's Conscience is defiled with Erroneous Opinions, and his Mind and
Understanding darkened, and bound under the Chains thereof, he is not able to
deliver himself, nor to purify his own Conscience, nor enlighten his own
Understanding, nor can any man deliver the Soul of his Brother: nothing less
then the Knowledge and Experience of the Light, Spirit and Mighty Power of
God's appearing and shining in the Conscience, and enlightening the Mind and
Understanding, breaking the Prison-Doors of Opinion, and pulling down the
Strong Hold of Imagination, is able to effect those things; therefore all such
as have their Consciences purified, their Minds and Understandings thereby
enlightened, are delivered and redeemed from the Spirit of Envy and Cruelty;
and from all private Opinions and Bondage of Darkness, and lives and walks in
the Light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ Jesus, which brings Peace on Earth
and Good Will to Men; and such never Envyed any, nor Hurt any about Religion,
though Jews, Turks and Infidels.

Oh! the Weight and Burden of this envivous Bloody Spirit of Persecution in
Christendom, which is sat down in the Throne of Conscience, and wrapped about
with the Mantle of Zeal for Religion, is very great and ponderous; it is the
greatest Burden the Earth bears, and the greatest Troubler of the World of
Mankind; it is the great Whore that John saw ride upon the Scarlet colored
Beast, and sat upon the Waters; and it is the Beast he saw rise out of the
Earth, with two Horns like a Lamb, yet speaks like a Dragon, and makes Fire
come down from Heaven, in the Sight of Men, and causes all both small and
great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a Mark in their right Hand, or
in their Foreheads, that no Man might buy or sell, save he that had the Mark
or the Name of the Beast, or the Number of his Name; this Spirit is the Womb,
out of which springs all the Force and Violence, and cruel Inventions of
Torture and spoil of Bodies, Goods and Liberties about Difference in Opinion,
Faith and Worship, which as is said before, is cruel, unreasonable and
unnatural because by the Laws of God and all good Men,
no Man ought to suffer, but according to the Nature of his Offense; if his
Offense be visible, natural and corporal, and belonging to things of this
world, then his Punishment ought to be natural, and corporal, and visibly
executed upon him; if his Offense be spiritual, and relating to the invisible
Things of the Mind, Heart and Conscience, in Matters of Faith and Worship
toward God, and the Life and World to come, then their Punishment is to be
spiritual and executed spiritually; and the Weapons to be used against such,
are not to be carnal: The Bodies of Men ought not to be inquisition'd and
tortured, What Persecution is.
nor their Goods spoiled for the errors of their Minds, or the Difference of
their religious Persuasions; wherever this is sound and practiced, it may be
justly called cruel and unreasonable, and bloody Persecution, though under the
Pretense of Conscience, and Zeal for Religion: And the true Christian and
Church of Christ, never had, nor ever will have a Hand in such Work; it is the
Whore the false Church, and her Children, The Beast, the Whore, the false
Prophet, the three unclean Spirits, Mystery-Babylon the great the Mother of
Harlots, etc. rules and reigns not only at Rome in Italy, Spain and other
popish Countries where the Romish Sect prevails, as some private Opinionists
have imagined; but is universally to be found, reigning throughout all the
Sects in Christendom, and in the whole World.
the great red Dragon that gets into Heaven, and the Beast that arises out of
the Sea or Waters, on which the Whore sisteth, and the false Prophet, and the
three unclean Spirits like Frogs, that come out of their Mouths, that
corrupts the Earth, and fills it with Violence; it is this Woman, this
Mystery Babylon the great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth,
that is drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs
of Jesus; and by her Sorceries are all Nations deceived, and in her was (and
is) found the Blood of Prophets and of Saints, and of all that were (and are)
slain upon the Earth.

Now the Voice from Heaven is heard, which says, Come out of her my People,
that ye partake not of her Sins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues: And
all that hear obey and follow this heavenly Voice, come to be led out of
Mystery Babylon, into the heavenly City Jerusalem, which comes down from God
out of Heaven, and to be made Citizens thereof, who are at Unity within
themselves; and though the Gates stand open there shall in no wise enter any
thing that defiles, neither whatsoever works abomination, or makes a Lie;
but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life: Here all is shut out
that entered in through Sin and Transgression, and through the Subtilty and
Lies of the Serpent, and a Redemption and Restoration into the glorious
primitive Estate, that God made Mankind in in the Beginning, where his Mind
Heart and Conscience is set at Liberty, cleansed and purified from all that did
defile them, and here he is delivered from following all his carnal Inventions,
private Opinions and Notions, where the Envy, Anger and Wrath is exercised,
into the peaceable universal Light, and Love to the whole Creation of God.

But while People are carnaly-minded, and their Consciences darkened and
defiled they are captivated by a private selfish Spirit, and are bound under
some dark affected Opinion or other about Religion; in this State some will be
for Paul. some for Apello, some for Cophas; but none for Christ; some of one
Sect or Opinion, and of one Sort and Form of Worship, and some of another; but
all bound under one Link or other of the Chain of Darkness, and are Slaves to
the Prince thereof, who has got the Rule in their Minds, Hearts and
Consciences, and such of his Vassals, as are inclined to seem religious, he
will furnish them with a Form, Likeness and Pattern, if need be, even of
Heavenly Things themselves, according to the State, Place and Country they
inhabit, and the Region of Darkness and Shadow of Death they dwell under;
whether in Christendom, or in any other Part of the World; hence many are bound
in their Consciences, to worship according to the Precepts and Commands of
Mahomet or the Turkish Alcoron, others according to the Traditions of the
scattered Jews and Indians; others according to the Pope and his Mass Book, and
other Invented Trumpery, others according to the diverse Sorts of invented
Liturgies and Forms of Worship, Likenesses and Images, which they have set up
in their carnal Minds, and darkened Understandings wherein their corrupt
Faiths, and defiled Consciences, are employed as Champions to contend for, and
vindicate every one his own private carnal Opinion, Tradition and Form of
Worship: And the same Spirit of Darkness, that leads into these Diversities of
Opinions, and humane, carnal Inventions about the Worship of God; The Fruit of
Mankind hating the Light and running, and walking, and working in Darkness.
leads Men to hate, * envy and persecute one another about them.

And all these Things come to pass amongst Mankind, for want of believing in
the Light, Grace, Spirit and Power of God, that shines, appears and operates in
the Mind. Heart and Conscience of Mankind, according to the State it finds him
in, either to reprove or commend, justify or condemn, which Light, Grace and
Spirit is one, and leads all that obey it and follow it into Oneness of Mind,
and Oneness of Heart, and into the One standing and everlasting Worship, which
is in the Spirit and in the Truth, where Acceptance is felt, and the Light of
God's Countenance enjoyed, the Partition Wall broken down, and the Enmity
slain, and the Serpent's Head bruised within, by the springing up of the
promised Seed, and powerful Appearance of Christ within, who leads into that
blessed Love and Charity, which never fails, which thinks no Evil, where
the rejoicing is not in Iniquity, but in the Truth.

And whoever thou art that read these Things, and art not come to witness
within thy self, the virtuous Efficacy of the Power, Life and Blood of Jesus,
to cleanse, purge and purify thy Mind, Heart and Conscience, from all that
does defile, and set them at perfect Liberty to serve the Lord, and to lead
thee into the heavenly City, where the Book of Life is kept, and to see thy
Name written therein, and also his Name imprinted in thy Forehead, bearing his
heavenly Image as thou have born the earthly; I say, except thou know these
Things wrought by the Spirit and Power of God in thee and for thee; thy Mind,
Heart and Conscience remains defiled, and under Bondage to thine own
Inventions, private Opinions and Notions; and he that is called the Prince of
the Air, rules in thy heart, and thou art captivated, and carried away with the
windy Doctrines, Rudimens and carnal Ordinances, and Traditions of men, and art
tasting, touching and handling those Things, which perish with the using; and
art prone and liable to bite, tear, murder and devour thy Brother and Neighbor
about them; so art as a whited Wall, and painted Sepulcher, and professing
Hypocrite, and Titular Christian, a direct Phanatick and Sectarian, and art
like Cain a Fugitive in the Earth, which God has cursed, that brings forth
Briars and Thorns, which tear the Sheep, and hurt the Lilly; this is thy State
and Condition, let thy Talk, Profession, Notion, Opinion, Form and Fashion of
Religion be what it will, and whether thou art a Jew, Mohammedan, Papist, or
Protestant, while thy Mind, Heart and Conscience is defiled, darkened,
captivated and bound under with the Chains of Opinion, Tradition and Precepts
of men thou can not enjoy Liberty of Conscience thy self, nor suffer others;
and if thou compassest Sea and Land to make Proselytes to thy Opinion and
Tradition, and have Power to force and compel an Outward Conformity to the
same, thou make them two fold more the Children of Hell then before. Force,
Cruelty and Violence may make Hypocrites and Formalists, but No True
Worshippers of God in the Spirit, nor Christians indeed.

Finally, to Force and Compel by Corporal Punishments in Matters of Conscience
and Religion, is infallibly contrary to, and inconsistent with, the very Nature
of true Religion and Being of Christianity: And among whomsoever its found and
practiced, it is an evident Demonstration that the Pure Religion they are
ignorant of, and Strangers to; and such are only Christians in Name and
Opinion, and of a dark, narrow, private, self-conceited spirit, priding it self
with it own Notions and lofty Imaginations, grounded upon the Education and
Tradition received from his Forefathers, and the carnal Comprehensions and
Conceivings of his own corrupt Heart from the ancient Writings of Holy Men:
hence it is that every Sect and Opinionist, like so many Beasts with Horns,
push one against another, hate, bite, tear and devour one another, each
endeavoring to sit down as a Queen in the Seat of the Scornful (exercising
themselves in things that are too high) Imperiously measuring, trying and
judging his Brother and Neighbor, who differs from him by his selfish, carnal,
dark, exalted spirit, who passes under and assumes the Name of a Sheep, though
in Nature and Work he be a Wolf; and if this Beast of Prey has Horns and Claws
strong enough to make Spoil according to its Nature, it would hardly leave the
Bones till the morrow: This is the Generation whose Teeth are as Swords,
Proverbs 30 14.
and their Jaw-Teeth as Knives to devour the Poor from off the Earth, and the
Needy from among men; this is the Generation also who are pure in their own
Eyes, yet are not washed from their Filthiness; but is as a polluted Leper,
full of Sores from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot: From this
Generation arises the Cry and Violence against the Innocent, as Heretics and
Blasphemers, haling them before Magistrates, and hurrying them to Goals,
Inquisitions, Gallowses and Fire, tearing the Flesh from the Bones, and the
Lise from the Body about Matters of Religion, Church, Faith, Worship and
Conscience, all which is infallibly the Fruit and Effect of that Spirit of
Cain, that Envious Sacrifices, that can Worship with one Hand, and Murder with
the other; call God Father, and with the same Tongue call Christ Jesus a
Blasphemer, Deceiver and Child of the Devil, and lay their Wicked Hands upon
him, as an Evil-doer not fit to live: this is and has been the Work of all the
Private, Carnal, Dark, Self-conceited Opinionsts in Christendom; who are all
Members of the False Church, and of the Great City Mystery Babylon, whose
Citizens are all of defiled Minds, corrupt Hears, and darkened, misguided, if
not seared Consciences: And none of this Work has been, nor never will be
found in the true Church, nor among the Citizens of the heavenly Ferusalem,
whose Defense and Weapons never was nor will be Carnal, but Spiritual, and
Mighty through God, to the breaking and casting down every thing that exalts
it self against the Prosperity thereof; whose Warfare was never against men's
Bodies, Lives nor Estates, to destroy the One, and possess the Other; neither
do the Thoughts thereof enter into the Heart of a True Christian to Hurt his
Brother or Neighbor, because of Difference in Religion, and Understanding of
things relating thereto: Yet the True Church has its Way and Means of Defense,
and every living Member thereof is in its Place and Capacity, engaged and bound
by the Law of the Spirit of Life and in the Universal Love of God,
to be watchful and diligent against the creeping in of Selfish Private
Opinions, and the broaching of Damnable Doctrines, or the growing up of any
hurtful Weeds in the Garden of God; but as I have said, this Defense is
spiritual, viz. the Light, Power and Spirit of God revealed in the Inward
Parts; this Church puts on the whole Armor of Light, the Sword of the Spirit,
the Helmet of Salvation, the Breast Plate of Righteousness, and the very Feet
shod with the Preparation of the Gospel (or with that which prepares the Way of
the Gospel); I say, these are Weapons of the True Church, and of every Member
thereof, whereby those that say they are Apostles, and are not, are tried, and
found Liars, and the Errors and Doctrines of Balaam detected, Read Rev. 1, 2,
3. and the Lord open thy Understanding.
and the Teachings of the Woman Jezabel, who calls her self a Prophetess,
resisted; yea, all the Faults and Errors of the Seven Churches are reproved and
judged by the Son of God, who holds the Seven Stars in his Right Hand, The
Son of God is in the midst of his People, who are like Gold tried in the Fire,
and made Vessels of Honor, to hold the Heavenly Treafure, and Temples of the
Living God; this is the true Church, that what she binds and loses on
Earth, is confirmed in Heaven, against which the Gates of Hell cannot prevail;
out of the Pale of this Church there is no Salvation: This is the Holy Church
that cannot err, where the infallible Judgment is, even in whom the Son of God
lives and walks in the midst, and has by his bright and powerful Appearance
broken down and removed all that is contrary to him, and set the Mind, Heart
and Conscience at perfect Liberty from all Private Opinions, Selfish
Conceivings, Dark Thoughts and Lofty Imaginations, which once did defile them:
In this Church is the one Mind, one Heart and one Judgment; and she has the
one Faith, one Baptism and one Lord, and is as a Coat woven from top to bottom,
without Seam: And all the Members of this Church are livin Stones, fitted and
squared for the House and Habitation of God; in the fitting and preparing of
which, the Sound or Noise of the Workman's Tool is not heard, nor Self had in
any Reputation; but the Praise and Glory of all is to God, the Worker of all in
his People; to whom all Honor is due forever and evermore.
Seven Golden Candlesticks; and those that turn not at his Reproof, Repent, and
are Reformed by his Judgments, will assuredly in the End hear this fatal
Sentence, I gave her space to repent, and she repented not; behold I will cast
her into a Bed, and them that commit Adultery with her, into great Tribulation;
I will kill her Children with Death, and all the Churches shall know, that I am
he that searches the Reins and Hearts, and gives to every one according to
his Works; He that has an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the
Churches.

Something after, which should have been placed before.
REader, I would have thee seriously weigh and consider what thou read in
this small Treatise, and with the Measure of Divine Light, which shines in thy
Mind, Heart and Conscience (whether thou be Darkness or Light, a Believer or an
Infidel) take a perfect View of thy self, and thou may by the Light thereof
infallibly perceive and know, Whether thou art a Member of the None can be of
the holy Catholic Church further then they walk in the Light, learn of the
Grace, and profit by the Manifestation of the Spirit of God, given to them, and
is present with them, convincing, reproving and judging all and every
Appearance of Evil, and ready to teach and lead into all Good; and it is those
only that are led and guided by the spirit of God that are his Sons and
Daughters, and Members of the holy church, which is in God; he that can receive
it, let him.
Holy Catholic Church, or whether thou art of some private Opinion or Sect,
which only calls it self so; and whether thy Mind, Heart and Conscience-are
cleansed, and set at Liberty from all that did defile and imbondage them; or,
whether thou art corrupted and defiled, captivated and bound under with the
Chains of Darkness, Superstitious Education, Corrupt Tradition and Selfish
Opinions, kindling thy Sacrifices with Coals from thy own Altar, and walking in
the Light of thy own Sparks, by the Eye or Light of God, which runs to and fro
through the Earth, and searches thy Heart, tries thy Reins and shows unto
thee thy Thoughts, thou may see thy own state and condition, how thou
stand in the Sight of the Lord: and if thy Mind be spiritual, thou have Life
and Peace; if thy Heart be pure, thou see the Lord; if thy Conscience be
purged from dead Works, thou art a Servant of the living God, and find
Acceptance with him, being alive to Righteousness, and dead to Sin: but if thou
do Evil, Sin lies at thy Door, and he that saves his People from their Sins
thou art ignorant of, and Death, the Wages thereof, attends thee, profess what
thou will, and let thy notion and opinion be what it will, let thy form and
fashion of Worship and Religion be what it will, whether thou art a Jew,
Mahumetan, Papist or Protestant, this is the Word of Truth to thee, whether
thou will hear or forbear, thou shall find it sealed upon thee in the Day of
the Lord.
