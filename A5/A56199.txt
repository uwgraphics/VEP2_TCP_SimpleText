ROMES MASTERPIECE: OR, The Grand Conspiracy of the Pope and his Iesuited
Instruments, to extirpate the Protestant Religion, re-establish Popery, subvert
Laws, Liberties, Peace, Parliaments, by kindling a Civil War in Scotland, and
all his Majesty's Realms, and to poison the King himself in case he comply
not with them in these their execrable Designs.

Revealed out of Con^cience to Andreas ab Habernfeld, by an Agent sent from
Rome into England, by Cardinal Barbarino, as an Assistant to Con the Popes
late Nuncio, to prosecute this most Execrable Plot, (in which he persisted a
principal Actor several years) who discovered it to Sir William Boswell his
Majesty's Agent at the Hague, 6 Sept. 1640. He, under an Oath of Secrecy, to
the Archbishop of Canterbury (among whose Papers it was casually found by
Master Prynne, May, 31. 1643.) who communicated it to the King, As the greatest
business that ever was put to him.

Published by Authority of Parliament. By William Prynne, of Lincolnes Inn,

TO The Right Honorable ROBERT Earl of WARWICK, Baron of LEEZE, AND LORD
ADMIRAL of all the Parliaments Sea Forces.
Right Honorable,
YOur eminent zealous Sincerity, and incomparable Activity both by Sea and Land
in defense of our undermined, endangered Protestant Religion, Laws, Liberties,
Parliament, Nation, against the many late secret Plots, and open Hostilities of
Antichristian Romish Vipers, who for sundry years together, have desperately
conspired, and most vigorously prosecuted their utter extirpation, and now
almost accomplished this their infernal Design, unless Gods infinite mercy
(which has never hitherto been wanting to us in times of greatest extremity)
miraculously disappoint it; has induced me to dedicate this Master-p^ece of
the Romanists, and Jesuits Iniquity, to your most Noble Patronage.

Wherein your Lordship may summarily behold the most horrid conspiracy against
our Reformed Religion, and the very life of the King our Sovereign in case he
comply not with them (as now alas He does overmuch in all things) that ever was
discovered to the world: and clearly descry, who have been the real original
Contrivers, Fomenters of all those late bloody civil wars, which have
suddenly transformed our peaceable, pleasant delectable Edens of England,
Ireland, Scotland, into most desolate rufull Acheldamaes, yea Golgothaes, to
the just amazement of our selves, and astonishme^t of all our Neighbor
Nations: who now more lament our present Infelicity, then ever their envied our
pristine Tranquillity.

It was an admirable act of Divine Providence, that a principal Actor in this
Conspiracy, sent from Rome to promote it, should out of remorse of conscience
prove the first Revealer of it to Sir William Boswell: But it was a far more
wonderful hand of God; that after this Plot had been long concealed from
public knowledge by Canterbury, who smothered it; he should unexpectedly
raise Me up from my foreign Close Prison of Mount-Orgueil Castle in Jersey,
(where Canterbury and his Confederates had intombed me sundry years, as Psalm.
31. 12. Psalm. 88. 4, 5.
a dead man out of mind, whom they remembered no more, reputing me among the
number of those that go down into the pit, and as one quite cut off by their
hands, never likely to rise up again till the general Resurrection;) and not
only reduce me with Honor and Triumph to my Native Country, restore me to my
former liberty, and Profession by the Parliaments impartial Justice; and make
my former and my fellow Sufferers unjust Censures, the ruin of the
S^archamber, Highcommission, and Prelates, who censured us; but likewise,
beyond all expectation, send this Archprelate (though the Kings chief
Favorite) a Prisoner to the Tower of London, to which I was first of all
committed by his malice; and employ me to search his Papers there, where he had
formerly twice searched mine by his Instruments, and therehy make Me both the
Discoverer and Publisher of this second Gunpowder Plot to the world, after a
long concealment of it, (and that in a time most seasonable;) which otherwise,
in all probability, had never come to light. Romans 11. 33.
O the depth of the Riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
unsearchable are his Judgments, and his ways past finding out!

This adorable strange Providence of the Dan. 2. 22, 23.
God of Heaven, (who reveals the deep and secret things, and knows what is
in the darkness, and makes known unto us the Kings matter,) as it should
ascertaine us, of his future Protection of our Church and State against these
Romish Conspirators, whose traiterous Designs he has formerly most admirably
discovered, and frustrated from time to time; So it should add much dignity
and acceptance to this Discovory, and enlarge our gratulations to God for it.

To his Blessing I shall in my Prayers recommend this Masterpiece, together
with your Lordships Person, and all your Heroic Endeavors for our Religions,
our Republikes security, and for ever remain

Your Lordships most affectionate Servant William Prynne.

SInce the first Publishing in Print of the ensuing Plot and Letters by
Authority and Directions from the House of Commons, which employed me in this
service; I have been credibly informed by some Friends, that many inoredulous,
over- suspicious Malignants (who think there is as much falsehood, dishonesty in
others; as in themselves) have questioned the Truth of the ensuing Plot,
Letters, Papers; and confidently, if not impudently, averred them to be mere
Fictions, without any shadow, proof, reason, ground at all, but their own
malicious misbeliefe.

But to satisfy all the world in this Particular, and these slanderous
Infidels too, if not ^rodigiously obstinate: I do here attest upon the faith
and honor of a Christian;

First, that I found all these ensuing Letters, Papers in the Archbishop of
Canterburies Chamber in the Tower of London under his own custody, when I was
unexpectedly employed by the Close Committee, in that undesired service of
searching it, which the Archbishop himself, his Servants, the Gentlemen and
Soldiers, who then accompanied me, with those who employed me, can witness,
and have already often attested.

Secondly, that they were all Originals, no^ Copies, under the several hands
and Seals of Sir William Boswell, Knight (the Kings own Ledger Ambassador at
Hague in the N^therlands;) Andreas ab Habernfeld, (a Noble Bohemian, Physician
to the Queen of Bohemia; a man of known sincerity and untainted reputation:)
The Archbishop of Canterbury (who must be the sole forger of the Plot, and
Letters, if fained;) and of the King himself: As the Letters, Papers themselves
(o^t viewed by diverse of the Lords, Commons, and other persons of quality for
their satisfaction, all now remaining in the Custody of a Committee of the
House of Commons, where any incredulous Thomas, who dares trust his own senses,
may view them at his leisure) will evidence to all who know their Hands or
Seals.

Thirdly, that the Archbishop himself, and his Servants, have confessed the
verity, reality of the Plot and Papers to diverse who repaired to them for their
own resolution therein; and the Archbishop in his late Petition to the Lords in
Parliament for restitution of these Papers, has again fully acknowledged
their reality.

Fourthly, (which puts all out of question) had these Letters, Papers been
Forgeries, or Impostures, not real verities, his Majesty himself, or the
Oxford Mercury for him; at least the Archbishop, Sir William Boswell, Andreas
ab Habernfeld, or some of their Instruments, being all living, and the Presses
open; would long ere this have detected this forgery, and disclaimed these
Papers and Letters in Print: which neither of them have done in seven Months
space; whereas each of them on the contrary (as I am informed) have avouched
these several Letters, Papers to be genuine, and their own.

Finally, it had been a strange oversight, yea madness in my self, and a
great dishonor to, a most impolitique devise in the Parliament, to publish
forged Letters in these eminent living Persons names; who want neither will,
means, nor power immediately to detect, refute, and manifest such a gross
Imposture to all the world, to the eternal infamy of the Publishers. Let
Malignants and Papists then, with all others, who have any sparks of Honesty,
or Policy, remaining in them, henceforth rest assured of the verity, reality,
of this Plot, these Papers, though they have formerly doubted of them; else let
them perish in their groundless Infidelity; who will neither believe the King,
the Archbishop, Sir William Boswell, nor Hab^rnfeld, under their Hands and
Seals; nor yet the Parliament, nor Discoverer of them (by an admirable
unexpected Divine Providence) who abhorres all fictions, frauds, Impostures
whatsoever, and can do nothing against the truth, ^ C^r. 13. 8.
but for the truth.

I shall only add this to the Premises; that the multitude of his Majesty's
royal Letters of Grace, and Discharges of Popish Recusants, Priests, Jesuits,
together with his Marriage-Articles, Oaths, Letter to the Pope, and other
evidences lately published in The Popish Royal Favorite, the late horrid
Rebellion in Ireland, the Rebels seizing of the Goods, Estates, and Persons of
all the English Protestans there to the Kings use; and their bloody massacre by
blood-thirsty Papists, See the Acts of the General Assembly of the ^ebels at
^ilkenny, Anno 164^. printed at ^ondon Marc^ 6. 1643. The Myste^y of lniquity,
p. 32. 33. etc.
For the exaltation of the holy Roman Catholic Church, and the advancement of
his Majesty's service, etc. And that by virtue of his Majesty's special
Commission under the Great Seal of Scotland, and Letters of direction sent
therewith, for the effecting of this great Work; which Commission, together
with the Arguments evidencing the reality thereof, you may read at large in the
Mystery of iniquity newly published, page 34. to 42. his Majesty's Articles of
Pacification with those Rebels, ratified under the Great Seal of England,
wherein he calls these bloody Rebels, his Roman Catholic Subjects, and good
Subjects in some copies; and gives them Authority to persecute his Protestant
Subjects in Irelands, with license to send such Agents to his Majesty from time
to time as they shall think fit; accepting a grant of thirty thousand eight
hundred pound from them, and making their base Irish money current in England
by a special Proclamation; his sending for the Soldiers sent by the
Parliament into Ireland to subdue the Rebels, and for Irish Rebels too, into
England, and that By his Majesty's special Commission and Authority; (as The
48 week ending December, ^. p. 681. 685.
Mercurius Aulicus informs us twice together) and administering an Oath to every
Officer and Soldier that shall be transported, To the utmost of his power, and
hazard of his life to fight against the Forces now under the conduct of the
Earl of Essex, and against all other Forces whatsoever that are or shall be
raised under what pretense soever, contrary to his Majesty's Command or
Authority* in defense of our Protestant Religion, Laws, Liberties. All these
particulars laid together, will infallibly demonstrate the reality of this
design, and how far it has prevailed even with the King himself; whose
heart and person (now wholly captivated and stolen away from the Parliament and
Kingdom by these Conspirators) the good God rescue out of their Traytorly
hands, and restore unto us in d^e season: which shall be the prayer of the
Publishe^ of this Plot,

William Prynne.

ROMES MASTERPIECE.
IF there be any professing the Protestant Religion within the Kings Dominions,
or elsewhere, who are yet so wilfully blinded as not to discern, so so^tishly
incredulous as not to believe, any real long-prosecuted conspiracy, by former
secret practices, and the present wars to extirpate the Protestant Religion,
re-establish Popery, and inthrall the people in all three Kingdoms,
notwithstanding all visible effects, and transparent Demonstrations of it,
lively set forth in the late Declaration of the Lords and Commons, concerning
the Rise and Progress of the Grand Rebellion, with other Remonstrances of that
nature, most visibly appearing in the late Articles of Pacification, made by
his Majesty's Authority and approbation with the Irish Rebels, contrary to
diverse Acts of Parliament passed by the King this present Session: Let them now
advisedly fix their Eyes, Minds, upon the ensuing Letters and Discoveries,
(seized on by Master Prynne, in the Archbishops Chamber in the Tower, May 31.
1643. by Warrant from the Close Committee, to search his Papers there, being
unexpectedly commanded on that service) and then they must needs acknowledge it
an indubitable verity; Since Sir William Boswell, the Archbishop himself, if
not his Majesty, and those who revealed this Plot, were persuaded of its
reality upon the first Dis^overy, before it brake forth openly in Ireland, and
England.

Who and what the Author of this Discovery was; who the chief active
instruments in the Plot; when, and where they assembled; in what vigorous
manner they daily prosecuted it; how effectually they proceeded in it; how
difficult it is to dissolve or counter-work it, without special diligence, the
Relation it self will best discover. Whose verity if any question, these
Reasons will enforce belief:

First, That the Discoverer was a chief Actor in this Plot, sent hither from
Rome by Cardinal Barbarino; to assist Con the Popes Legate in the pursuit of
it, and privy to all the particulars therein discovered.

Secondly, That the horror and reality of the conspiracy so troubled his
conscience, as it engaged him to disclose it, yea to renounce that bloody
Church and Religion, which contrived it; though bred up in, preferred by it,
and promised greater advancements for his deligence in this design.

Thirdly, That he discovered it under an Oath of Secrecy, and offered to
confirm every particular by solemn Oath.

Fourthly, That he discovers the persons principally employed in this Plot,
the places and times of their secret conventions; their manner and diligence in
the purs^ite of it, with all other circumstance^ so punctually, as leaves no
place for doubt.

Fifthly, The principal Conspirators nominated by him are notoriously known to
be fit instruments for such a wicked design.

Sixthly, Many particulars therein have immediate relation to the King and
Archbishop, to whom he imparted this Discovery, and it had been an impudent
boldness and irrational, frentick act, to reveal any thing for truth to the
King and Bishop, which they could disprove on their own knowledge.

Seventhly, Sir William Boswell, and the Archbishop, if not the King himself,
were fully satisfied, that it was real and most important.

Eighthly, Some particulars are ratified by the Archbishops testimony, in the
Memorials of his own life, written with his own hand some years before; and
others so apparent, that most intelligent men in Court and City, were
acquainted with them whiles they were acting, though ignorant of the plot.

Finally, The late sad effects of this Conspiracy in all three Kingdoms, in
prosecution of this design, compared with it, are such a convincing evidence of
its reality; and Gods admirable hand of Providence in bringing this concealed
plot so seasonably to light, (by an instrument unexpectedly raised from the
grave of Exile and imprisonment, to search the Archbishops papers, in the
Tower, who had there seized his in former times, and shut him up close prisoner
in a Foreign Dungeon) such a testimony from Heaven super-added to the
premises, that he who deemes it an imposture, may well be reputed an Infidel,
if not a Monster of incredulity.

The first overture and larger Relation of the plot it self were both writ in
Latin, as they are here Printed, and faithfully translated word for word, as
near as the Dialect will permit. All which premised, the Letters and plot here
follow in order.

Sir Williams Boswels first Letter to the Archbishop concerning the Plot.
May it please your Grace,
THe offers (whereof your Grace will find a Copy) here enclosed toward a
further and more particular discovery, were first made unto me at the second
hand, and in speech, by a friend of good quality and worth in this place; But
soon after (as soon as they could be put into Order) were avowed by the
principal party; and delivered me in writing by both together: Upon promise,
and Oath, which I was required to give, and gave accordingly, not to reveal
the same to any other man living but your Grace; and by your Graces hand, unto
his Majesty.

In like manner they have tied themselves not to declare these things unto any
other, but my self; until they should know, how his Majesty and your Grace
would dispose thereof. The Principal giving me withal to know, That he puts
himself, and this secret into your Graces power, as well because it concerns
your Grace so nearely after his Majesty: As that he knows your wisdom to
guide the same aright: And is assured of your Graces fidelity to his Majesty's
Person, to our State, and to our Church.

First, Your Grace is humbly, and earnestly prayed, To signify his Majesty's
pleasure (with all possible speed) together with your Graces disposition
herein, and purpose to carry all with silence, from all, but his Majesty until
due time.

Secondly, When your Grace shall think fit to show these things unto his
Majesty* To do it immediately; not trusting to Letters; nor permitting any
other person to be by, or in hearing: And to entreat and counsel his Majesty
as in a case of Conscience to keep the same wholly, and solely in his own
bosom, from the knowledge of all other creatures living but your Grace; until
the business shall be clear, and sufficiently in his Majesty's and your
Graces hands to effect.

Thirdly, Not to enqure or demand the names of the parties from whom these
overtures do come, or any further discoveries and advertisements in pursuit of
them which shall come hereafter, until due satisfaction shall be given in
every part of them. Nor to bewray unto any person but his Majesty, in any
measure or kind, that any thing of this nature, or of any great importance is
come from me.

For as I may believe these overtures are verifiable in the way they will be
laid; and that the parties will not shrink: So I may account, That if never so
little a glimpse, or shadow of these informations shall appear by his
Majesty's, or your Graces speech or carriage, unto others, the means whereby
the business may be brought best unto trial, will be utterly disappointed:
And the parties who have in Conscience toward God, and devotion to his
Majesty; affection to your Grace, and compassion of our Country, disclosed
these things, will run a present and extreme hazard of their persons, and
lives, So easily it will be conjectured (upon the least occasion given upon his
Majesty's or your Graces parts) who is the discoverer? By what means, and how
he knows so much of these things; And where he is? These are the points, which
together with the offers, they have pressed me especially to represent most
seriously unto your Grace.

For my own particular, having most humbly craved pardon of any error or
omissions, that have befalne me in the mesnaging of this business, I do
beseech your Grace to let me know;

First, Whether, and in what order I shall proceed hereafter with the parties?

Secondly, What points of these offers I shall chiefly, and first put them to
enlarge and clear?

Thirdly, What other points and enquiries I shall propose unto them? And in
what manner?

Fourthly, How far further I shall suffer my self to hear and know these
things*

Fifthly, Whether I shall not rather take the parties answers, and discoveries
sealed up by themselves, and having likewise put my own seal upon them,
without questioning or seeing what they contain, so to transmit them to his
Majesty or your Grace?

Sixthly, Whether I may not insinuate upon some fair occasion, That there will
be a due Regard held of them, and their service, by his Majesty and your Grace:
When all particulars undertaken in these general offers, and necessary for
perfecting the discovery and work intended, shall be effectually delivered to
his Majesty on your Grace?

Upon these heads, and such others as his Majesty or your Grace shall think
proper in the business, I must with all humility beseech your Grace to furnish
me with instructions, and warrant for my proceedings, under his Majesty's hand
with your Graces attestation, as by his Majesty's goodness, and Royal
disposition is usual in like cases.

May it please your Grace to entertain a Cipher with me upon this occasion, I
have sent the Counterpart of one here enclosed: In the vacant spaces whereof
your Grace may insert such names more, with numbers to them, as you think
requisite.

If these overtures happily sort with his Majesty's and your Graces mind, and
shall accordingly prove effectual in their operation, I shall think my self a
most happy man, to have had my oblation in so pious a work for my most gracious
Sovereign and Master: More particularly, in that your Grace under his Majesty
shall be, Opifex rerum and mundi melioris origo. Which I shall incessantly
beg in my prayers at his hands, who is the giver of all good things, And will
never forsake, or ^aile them, who do not first fail, and fall from him: The
God of mercy and Peace. With which I remain evermore.

I have not dared to trust this business (without a Cipher) but by a sure
hand, for which* I have sent this bearer, my Secretary, Express, but he
knows nothing of the contents hereof.

Your Graces Most dutiful and obliged servant. William Boswell.

Andreas ab Habernfeld his Letter to the Archbishop concerning the Plot
revealed to him.
Illustrissime ac reverendissime Domine,
COncutiuntur omnes sensus mei, quoties p^aesens negotium mecum revolvo, nec
intellectus sufficit, quaenam aura tam horrenda attulerit, ut per me apricum
videant. Praeter spem enim bonus i^te vir mihi innotuit, qui cum me
discurrentem de turbis istis Scoticis audisset; ignorare me, inquit, nervum
Rei, superficialia esse ista quae vulgo sparguntur: Ab ista hora indies mihi
fiebat familiarior; qui dexteritate mea agnita, pleno pectore cordis sui onera,

me edocuit: quibus auditis, viscera mea convellebantur, tremebant horrore

conscientiam moventibus, animum hominis accendi; vix horam unam, monita
coxerat, abdita omnia aperuit, liberumque dedit, agerem, ut iis, quorum

Hagae Comitum Sept. 14. S. N. 1640. Observantissimus and officiosissimus
Andreas ab Habernfeld.

Most Illustrious and most Reverend Lord,
AL my senses are shaken together as often as I revolve the present business,
neither does my understanding suffice (to conceive) what wind has brought such
horrid things, that they should see the Sunshine by me: for besides expectation
this good man became known unto me, who when he had heard me discoursing of
these Scottish stirs, said that I knew not the nerve of the business, that
those things which are commonly scattered abroad are superficial: From that
hour he every day became more familiar to me; who acknowledging my dexterity
herein, with a full breast powered forth the burdens of his heart into my besome,
supposing that he had discharged a burden of conscience wherewith he was
pressed. Hence he related to me the Factions of the Jesuits, with which the
whole earthly world was assaulted; and showed, that I might behold how through
their poison, Bohemia and Germany were devoured, and both of them maimed with
an irreparable wound; that the same Plague did creep through the Realms of
England and Scotland, the matter whereof revealed in the adjacent writing, he
discovered to me: which things having heard If a stranger were thus affected at
the hearing of this Plot, how should we our selves be sensible thereof?
my bowels were contracted together, my loins trembled with horror, that a
pernicious gulf should be prepared for so many thousands of souls: with words
moving the conscience, I inflamed the mind of the man: he had scarce one hour
concocted my admonitions, but he disclosed all the secrets and he gave free
liberty that I should treat with those whom it concerned, that they might be
informed hereof. I thought no delay was to be made about the things: The same
hour I went to Master Boswell the Kings Ledger at the Hage, who being tied with
an oath of secrecy to me, I communicated the business to him, I admonished
him to weigh these things by the balance, neither to defer, but act, that
those who were in danger might be speedily succored: He, as becomes an honest
man, mindful of his duty, and having nearer looked into the business, refused
not to obey the monitions: moreover, he forthwith caused that an express
should be dispatched; and sent word back again what a most acceptable oblation
this had been to the King and your Grace; for which we rejoiced from the heart,
and we judged, that a safe and favorable Deity had interposed it self in this
business, whereby you might be preserved.

Now that the verity of the things related might be confirmed, some principal
heads of the conspiracy were purposely pret^rmitted, that the knowledge of them
might be ext^rted from the circumvented society of the conspirators.

Now the things will be speedily and safely promoted into act, if they be
warily proceeded in at Bruxels. By my advise, that day should be observed
wherein the Packet of Letters are dispatched, which under the title of, To
Monsieur Strario Archdeacon of Cambray, tied with one cover are delivered to
the postmaster, such a packet may be secretly brought back from him, yet it
will be unprofitable, because all the enclosed Letters are written
Characteristically. Likewise another Packet coming weekly from Rome, which is
brought under this subscription, To the most illustrious Lord Count Rossetti,
Legate for the time; these are not to be neglected: to whom likewise Letters
writ in the same Character are included. That they may be understood, Read is
to be consulted with. The forenamed day of dispatch shall be expected: In Reads
house an accumulated congregation may be circumvented; which succeeding, it
will be your Graces part to order the business. The intestine enemy being at
length detected by Gods grace, all bitterness of mind which is caused on
either side may be abolished, delivered to oblivion, deleted and quieted, the
enemy be invaded on both parts: thus the King and the Kings friend, and both
Kingdoms near to danger, shall be preserved, delivered from imminent danger.

Your Grace likewise may have this injunction by you, if you desire to have the
best advise given you by others, that you trust not overmuch to your
Pursevant^, for some of them live under the stipend of the popish party. How
many Rocks, how many Scillaes, how many displeased Charibdes appear before your
Grace, in what a dangerous sea the Cockbote of your Graces life, next to
shipwreck, is t^ssed, your self may judge, the fore deck^ of the Ship is
speedily to be driven to the harbor.

All these things (I whisper) into your Graces ear, for I know it bound with
an oath of secrecy, therefore by open name, I would by these presents become
known to your Grace,

His Letters sent by Sir W. Boswell about the discovery of the treason. I
conceive by the English Latin herein, that he m^st needs be an Englishman with
a concealed and changed name. And yet it may be this kind of Latin may relate
to the Italian. Or else he lived some good time in England. The declaration of
this treason I have by His Majesty's special command sent to Sir W. Boswell,
that he may there see what proof can be made of any particulars.

The general Overture and Discovery of the Plot, sent with Sir William Boswels
first Letter.
The Kings Majesty, and Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, are to be secretly
informed by Letters.
1. THat the Kings Majesty and the Lord Archbishop are both of them in great
danof their live^.

2. That the whole Commonwealth i^ by this means endangered, unless the
mischief be speedily prevented.

3. That these Scottish troubles are raised to the end, that under this
pretext, the King and Archbishop might be destroyed.

4. That there is a means to be prescribed, whereby both of them in this case
may be preserved, and this tumult speedily composed.

5. That The Je^uits pl^ts are never ended till they obtain their desired ends
in all things.
although these Scottish tumults be speedily composed, yet that the King is
endangered, and that there are many ways, by which destruction is plotted to
the King and L. Archbishop.

6. That a certain society has conspired, which attempts the death of the
King, and L. Archbishop, and Convulssion of the whole Realm.

7. That the same society every week deposits with the President of the
society, what intelligence every of them has purchased in eight days search,
and then confer all into one packet, which is weekly sent to the The Pope and
Cardin^ll (...)
Director of the business.

8. That all the confederates in the said conspiracy may verily be named by the
poll. But because they may be made known by other means, it is thought meet
to defer it till hereafter.

9. That there is a ready means, whereby the villainy may be discovered in one
moment, the chief conspirators circumvented, and the primary members of the
conju^ation, apprehended in the very act.

10. That very many about the King, His Majesty and the Realm may be soon
betrayed by such false attendants.
who are accounted most faithful and intimate, to whom likewise the more
secret things are instrusted, ARE TRAITORS TO THE KING, corrupted with a
foreign Pension, who communicate all secrets of greater or lesser moment to a
foreign power.

These and other most secret things, which shall be necessary to be known for
the security of the King, may be revealed, if these things shall be acceptable
to the Lord Archbishop.

In the mean time, if his Royal Majesty and the L. Archbishop desire to
consult well to themselvas, they shall keep these things, only superficially
communicated unto them, most secretly* under deep silence, not communicating
them so much as to those whom they judge most faithful to them, before they
shall receive by name, in whom they may confide; for else they are safe on no
side.

Likewise they may be assured, that whatsoever things, are here proposed, are
no figments, nor fables, nor vain dreams, but such real verities, which may
be demonstrated in every small tittle. For those who thrust themselves into
this business are such men, who mind no gain, but the very zeal of Christian
charity suffers them not to conceal these things: yet both from his Majesty
and the Lord Archbishop some small examplar of gratitude will be expected.

All these Premises have been communicated under good faith, and the Sacrament
of an oath to Mr. Ledger Ambassador of the King of Great Britain, at the
Hague; that he should not immediately trust, or communicate these things to any
mortal, besides the King and the L. Archbishop of Canterbury.

2. Totam Rempublicam hoc nomine periclitari, nisi propere occurratur malo.

9. Medium esse in promptu, quo uno momento detegi poterit scelus:

actu apprehendi.

10. Astantes Regi plurimos, qui pro fidelissimis and intimis censentur, quibus

11. Haec and alia secretissima, quae scitu ad securitatem Regis erunt
necessaria: quod si haec accepta Dom. Archiepiscopo fuerint, revelari poterunt.

12. Interim si Regia Majestas sua and Dominus Archiepiscopus been sibi
consultum volunt, haec superficialiter quidem tantum ipsis communicata, sub
profundo silentio, and secretissime servabunt, ne quidem iis, quos sibi
fidelissimos judicant, communicaturi, antequam de nomine acceperint, quibus
fidendum sit: Ab nullo enim latere ali^s tuti sunt.

Sint etiam certi quicquid hic proponitur; nulla figmenta, nec fabulas, aut

demonstrari poterunt: Qui enim se immiscent huic negotio, viri honesti sunt:
quibus nullus quaestus in animo; sed ipse Christianae charitatis fervor ista
facere non sinit: Ab utroque tamen, suae Majestati tum Domino Archiepiscopo,
gratitudinis exemplar tale quale expectabitur.

Haec omnia antecedentia sub bona fide and juramenti Sacramento, Dom. Residenti

The Plot against the King.

The Archbishop of Canterburies Letter to the King concerning the Plot: with
the Kings directions in the Margin, written with His own hand. I beseech Your
Majesty read these Letters a^ they are endorsed by figures, 1, 2, 3, etc.

May it please your Majesty,
AS great as the Secret is which comes herewith, yet I choose rather to send it
in this silent covert way, Ye had reason so to do.
and I hope safe, then to come thither, and bring it my self. First, because I
am no way able to make haste enough with it. Secondly, because should I come at
this time, and antedate the meeting September. 24. there would be more jealousy
of the business, and more enquiry after it: especially, if I being once there,
should return again before that day, as I must if this be followed, as is
most fit.

The danger it seems is imminent, and laid by God knows whom, but to be
executed by them which are very near about you. (For the great honor which I
have to be in danger with you, or for you, I pass not, so your sacred Person
and the State may be safe.) It is an unanswerable Dilemma.
Now, may it please your Majesty, This information is either true, or there is
some mistake in it: If it be true, the persons which make the discovery will
deserve thanks and reward; If there should be any mistake in it, your Majesty
can lose nothing but a little silence.

The business (if it be) is exteam foul. I c^ncur totally with you in opinion,
assuring you that no body does, or shall know of this business, and to show my
care to conceal it, I received this but this afternoon, and now I make this
dispatch before I sleep. Herewith I send his warrant, as you advise, which
indeed I judge to be the better way.
The discovery thus by Gods providence offered, seems fair. I do hereby humbly
beg it upon my knees of your Majesty, that you will conceal this business
from every creature, and his name that sends this to me. And I send his Letters
to me to your Majesty, that you may see his sense both of the business and
the secrecy. And such Instructions as you think fit to give him, I beseech you
let them be in your own hand for his warrant, without imparting them to any.
And if your Majesty leave it to his discretion to follow it there in the best
way he can, that in your own hand will be instruction and warrant enough for
him. And if you please to return it herewith presently to me, I will send an
express away with it presently.

In the mean time I have by this express returned him this answer, I like your
answer extreme well, and do promise not to deceive your confidence, nor make
you break your word.
That I think he shall do well to hold on the Treaty with these men with all
care and secrecy, and drive on to the discovery so soon as the business is
ripe for it, that he may assure himself and them, they shall not want reward,
if they do the service. That for my part he shall be sure of secrecy, and that
I am most confident that your Majesty will not impart it to any. That he have a
special eye to the eighth and ninth Proposition.

Sir, for Gods sake, and your own safety, I have sent all back. I think these
Apostyles will be warrant enough for you to proceed, especially when I
expressly command you to do so.
secrecy in this business: And I beseech you send me back this Letter, and
all that comes with it, speedily and secretly, and trust not your own pockets
with them. I shall not eat nor sleep in quiet till I receive them. And so soon
as I have them again, and your Majesty's warrant to proceed, no diligence shall
be wanting in me to help on the discovery.

This is the greatest business that ever was put to me. In this I am as far
from condemning your judgment as suspecting your fidelity. C. R.
And if I have herein proposed or done any thing amiss, I most humbly crave
your Majesty's pardon. But I am willing to hope I have not herein erred in
judgment, and in fidelity I never will.

These letters came to me on Thursday, September. 10. at night, and I sent these
away according to the date hereof, being extremely wearied with writing this
Letter, copying out these other which come with this, and dispaching my Letters
back to him that sent these, all in my own hand. Once again secrecy for Gods
sake, and your own. To his most blessed protection I commend your Majesty and
all your Affairs: and am

The Archbishops Postscript
As I had ended these, whether with the labor or indignation, or both, I fell
into an extreme faint sweat; I pray God keep me from a Fever, of which three
are down in my Family at Croyden.




These Letters came late to me, the express being beaten back by the wind.

Sir William Boswels second Letter to the Archbishop.
May it please your Grace,
THis evening late I have received your Graces dispatch, with the enclosed from
his Majesty, by my Secretary Oueart, and shall give due account with all
possible speed of the same, according to his Majesty's and your Graces
commands, praying heartily that my endeavors, which shall be most faithful,
may also prove effectual, to his Majesty's and your Graces content, with which
I do most humbly take leave, being always

acknowledgement that he has received the Kings directions and my Letters.

Sir William Boswels third Letter to the Archbishop, sent with the larger
discovery of the Plot.
May it please your Grace,
Upon receipt of his Majesty's Commands, with your Graces Letters of 9. and 18.
Sept* last. I dealt with the party to make good his offers formerly put in my
hand, and transmitted to your Grace: This he hopes to have done, by the
enclosed, so far as will be needful for his Majesty's satisfaction; yet if any
more particular explanation or discovery shall be required by his Majesty or
your Grace, He has promised to add thereunto, whatsoever he can remember and
knows of truth. And for better assurance and verification of his integrity, he
professes himself ready (if required) to make A very good Argument of truth
and reality.
oath of what he has already declared, or shall hereafter declare in the
business.

His name he conjures me still to conceal: though he thinks his Majesty and
your Grace, by the Character he gives of himself, will easily imagine who he
is, having been known so Therefore a man of note and employment.
generally through Court and City, as he was for three or four years, in the
quality and employment he acknowledges (by his Declaration enclosed) himself
to have held.

Hereupon he does also redouble his most humble and earnest suit unto his
Majesty and your Grace, to be most secret and circumspect in the business,
that he may not be suspected to have discovered, or had a hand in the same.

I shall here humbly beseech your Grace to let me know what I may further do
for his Majesty's service, or for your Graces particular behoof; that I may
accordingly endeavor to approve my self, as I am

Illustrissime ac Reverendissime Domine.
ACcepta suae Regiae Majestati simulac Reverentiae Tuae, suisse offerta nostra
lubentes, and ex animo percepimus. Adesse vobis benignitat^m Numinis, hoc
unicum nobis Index est, quo stimulus datu^, ut tanto alacrius, liberaliusque,
illa quibus vitae discrimen utriusque, statusque Regni Angliae, tum Scotiae,
eximiae Majestatis sede de^urbatio intendatur, effundamus, detegamus. Ne autem
ambagibus superfluis, dilatetur Oration, nonnulla, quae tantum ad rem necessaria
praemittemus.

Sciant primo, bonum istum virum per quem sequentia deteguntur, in pulvere isto
Pontificio esse natum and educatum, qui in dignitatibus Ecclesiasticis aetates
consump^it; Tandem praesentis Negotii expeditioni, par invent^^, Consilio and
mandato D^mini Card^nalis Barbarini, ad auxilium Domino Cuneo adjunctus est:
penes quem in officio ita diligens ac sedulus inventus, ut spes magnae
promotionis ipsi data fuerit: ipse vero, boni Spiritus ductus instinctu* ut ^t
dulcia promissa contempsit; agnitisque Religionis Pontificiae vanitatibus;
(quarum alias defensor fuerat severissimus) malitia etiam sub vexillo Papali
militantium notata, gravari Conscientiam suam senserat; quod onus ut deponeret;
ad Orthodoxam Religionem animum convertit: Mox ut Conscientiam ^uam exoneraret,
machinatum in tot innocents Animas scelus, revelandum censuit, levamen se
percepturum, si in sinum amici talia effundat. Quo facto ab eodem amico serio
conmonitus, verae conversionis, Charitisque exemplar ostenderet; libera^et ab
imminenti discrimine, innocents tot Animas; In cujus monita lubens
consenserat, calamoque sequentia excipiendum dederat, ex quibus Articuli non
ita pridem tuae Reverentiae oblati, luculenter explicari and demonstrari
poterunt.

1 Ante omnia, ut Cardo rei recipiatur, sci^ndum est, omnes istas, quibus tota
Christianitas hodie concutitur, factiones, exoriri, ab Jesuitica ista Chamea
Sobole, cujus quatuor per orb^m luxuriant ordines.

Primi Ordinis sunt Ecclesiastici, quorum Religionis promotoria, est c^rar^.

Secundi Ordi^is sunt Politici, quorum officium est, statum Regnorum, Rerumque
publicarum, quo quomodo intentare, turbare, reformare.

Tertii Ordinis sunt S^^ulares, quorum proprium est, Regibus, Principibusque,
ad officia sese obtrudere, insinuare, immiscere se rebus forensibus;
emptionibus, venditionibusque, and quae civilia sunt occupari.

Quarti Ordinis Exploratores sunt, sortis inferioris homines, qui servitiis
Magnatum, Principum, Baronum, Nobilium, Civium, sese sub nittunt, animis
dominorum imposituri.

II. Tot ordinum societatem, Regnum Anglicanum alit: Vix enim tota Hispania,
Gallia, and Italia tantam multitudinem, Jesuitarum, quantam unicum Londinum,
exhibere posset: Ubi plus ^uam 50 Scoti Jesuitae reperiuntur. Ibi sedem
iniquitatis, dicta societas sibi elegit, Conspiravitque in Regem, Regique
fidelissimos, inprimis vero Dominum Archiepiscopum Cantuariensem, etiam in
regnum utrumque.

III. Certo certius enim est; Determi^asse societatem nominatam, reforma^ione
universali Regnum Angliae tum Scotiae adficere; Determinatio ergo finis, in^ert
necessario determinationem mediorum ad finem.

IIII. Ad promovendum ergo susceptum scelus, Titulo, Congregationis Fidei
propagandae, dicta societas sese insignivit: quae Caput Collegii Pontificem
Romanum, substitutum and executorem, Cardi^alem Barbarinum, agnoscit.

V. Patronus Societatis primarius Londi^i, est Legatus Pontificius, qui curam
negotii gerit; in cujus sinum, saex illa proditorum omnia explorata,
hebdomadatim deponit: Impetrata autem est ^es^da Legationis istius Londini,
Pontifici^ Romani nomine, qua mediante, Cardinali Barbarino, agere in Regem
Reg^umque tanto tutius faciliusque liceret, Nullus enim alias, tam libere
ambire Regem posset, quam ille qui Pontificia Auctoritate palliatus sit.

VI. Fungebatur tum temporis, Officio Legati Pontificii, Dominus Cuneus
Conjura^ae societatis instrumentum ^niversale, and serius negotii promotor;
^ujus secreta, ut and aliorum exploratorum om^ium, prae^eus vir bonus,
communicator horum, excipiebat, expedie^batque quo res postulabat,

Adoriebatur Cuneus, primaria Regni Capita, nihilque intentatum sivi^, quomodo
singula corrumperet and ad partem Pontificiam inclinaret; var^^ incitamentis
plurimos alliciebat, Etiam Regem ipsum donationibus picturarum, A^tiquitatum,
Idolorum, aliarumque vantitatum Roma allatarum, deludendum quaer^bat, quae
tamen apud Regem nihil prof^^erant.

Familiaritate inita cum Rege, rogatur saepius Hantocurti, etiam Londini,
Palatini causam ageret, interponeretque autoritatem suam, intercession^ Lega^o
Coloniensi persu^deret, ut palatinus in conditiones, proximis Comitii^ de pace
acturis, insereretur, quod quidem pollicitus est; contrarium vero praestitit;
scripsit quidem. Jesuits know well how to equivocate thus.
Regatum se de talibus ^b Rege fuisse, non consulere tamen, ut consentiatur, If
Popes must not favor pro^^stant Princes, its a miracle that they should favor
them, or harbor any of their agents now near them.
ne ab Hispani^ fortasse dicatur, Pontificem Romanum Principi Haeretico
patrocinatum fuisse.

Subolfecit interim Cun^us, The papacy of Cant. and this other world is of
greater value then an Italian Cardinalship.
ab domino A^chiepiscopo Regi fidelissimo, totum animu^^ Regium esse pendulum^
Omnem se motu^um lapidem, nervosque adplicaturum statuerat, ut ad partem suam
lucrari p^ssit: Paratum ^^ habere medium certo confisu^; Mandatum enim hab*
bat, Pileum Cardinalem, nomine Pontificis Romani, domino Archiepiscopo
offerret, lactaretque pollicitis etiam sublimioribus, ut animum si ^cerum
corrumperet: Commoda tamen occasio nunquam dabatur, qua domino Archiepiscopo
sele in^inuare posse^ (quaerebat enim Scorpius ovum) Per Comitem and Comitissam
Arondeliana^, etiam per Secretarium Windibankum; liber accessus impetrari
debeat. Quorum omnium intercessionibus neglectis, societatem vel familiaritatem
Cunei, peste pejus fugiebat; Persuadebatur etiam ab aliis non infimis, ipsi
been notis, nec tamen conmovebatur.

VII. Quaerebatur and alius qui ad facinus detestandum accessum impediebat,
Secretarius Cook; erat is o^or Jesuitarum infensissimus, quibus aditum ad Regem
intercipiebat, excipebat plurimos pro meritis, in illorum factiones sedulo
i^quirebat; quo nomine incitamentum omne, vi^ magneticam ad partem Pontificiam
spirans, erat apud ipsum inefficax, nihil enim tam carum erat, quod ipsum ad
pravum inclinasset: Hinc, Conjurationis Patronis exosus factus; pe^iclitabatur
de officio ut exueretur, laborabatur per triennium, quod ultimo impetratum.

Mansit nihilominus ab part Regis, nodus solutu difficilis; Dominus
Archiepiscopus enim constantia sua, sicuti durissimum sese interposuit saxum.

Laborasse se incassum, ab part domini Archiepiscopi Cuneus cum intellexisset,
efferbuit m^litia ipsius, totiusque Societatis; mox (...) parari caeperunt,
quibus dominus Archiepiscopus una cum Rega caperetur.

In regem quoque (cujus gratia totum istud disponitur Negotium) a quo quia
nihil quod promovendae Religioni Papisticae inserviret speratur, (imprimis
vero, Cum animum suum aperuerit, se ejus opinionis esse, quemvis in Religione
sua dummodo vir probus and pius sit, Salvari p^sse) sententia lata est.

VIII. Ad perpetrandum susceptum facinus, executio criminalis VVestmonaste^i,
per scripta nonualla Puritanorum causata, primi incendii ansam dedit, quae res
ab Papistis apud Puritanos in tantum ex^cerbabatur, exaggerabaturque, ut si
inulta maneret, Religioni ipsis duceretur; cujus incendii, subsequens tandem
liber precum, flammas auxit.

IX. In isto fervore expeditus furit ad Scotos ab part pontificia Comes quidam
Scotus Maxfi^ld, ni fallor nomine, cum quo, duo alii Comites Scoti Papistae,
correspondebant. Is commovere debebat plebem, injuriamque refricare ut animos
accenderet, ad arma precipitaret, quibus noxius libertatis Scoticae perimeretur
Turbator.

X. Ibi una opera paratus in Casses Regi, eo enim directum esse praesens
negotium ut Anglorum complurimi sese adglutinarent Scotis; Rex armis maneret
inferior, qui ab Papistis auxilia petere cogeretur, quae tamen non impetraret,
nisi in conditiones descenderet, quibus libertatem Vniversalem exercitii
Religionis Pontifi^iae, permitteret; it a enim res Papistarum ad nutum
succederent, Quo consensu si difficiliorem sese exhibuerit, remedium erit in
promptu: Adolescente enim cum primum Regio filio, (qui a teneris, ut parti
Pontificiae adsuescat educatur) de Rege actum est: Nux quippe Indica acutissimo
veneno referta in societate servatur (quam Cuneus tum temporis gloriabundus
mihi oftentabat) quo Regi exemplo Patris, parabatur Pharmacum.

XI. In ista Commotione Scotica Marquess d' Hamelton saepius Regis nomine ad
Scotos ablegatur, regiam auctoritatem interponere^, qua aestus animorum
mitigaretur, sine fructu tamen, reque infecta toties reversu^. Ipsius
Concionator tum temporis nos adiit, qui cum Cuneo secret nonnulla
Communicavit; Interrogatus a me, joco; Number etiam Iudaei, cum Samaritanis
convenirent? Ad quae Cuneus respondit, Vtinam omnes ministri tales, ut ipse,
essent; conjiciatur hinc quidcunque.

XII. Rebus sic stantibus, ab Cardinali Richelieu, Dominus Thomas Cam^rarius,
Sacellanus and Eleemosinarius ipsius, natione Scotus, Londinum adpulit; Qui
Colleg^o Societatis conjuratae adsidere debebat, remque serio agere, ^ihil
intentatum relinquere, quo primus exasperaretur servor. Quo officio honorarium
Episcopatus, erat ipsi pollicitum. Cohabitabat and Societati per quatuor
Menses, nec prius discedendum licebat, donec rebus ex voto cedentibus, cum
bonis novis redux fieri possit.

XIII. Cavalliero To^ias Mathei Sacerdos Jesuita, ordinis politicorum, e
capitibus primariis homo vigilantissimus, cui nunquam tam charum cubile, quo
caput reclinet; ad sellam tantum, hor^una, at que altera, somno corpus reficit;
nec diei nec nocti, machiname^tis parcit, vir sum noxius and ipsa Regis,
Regnique Angliae Pestis, homo impudentissimus, qui per omnia convivia,
epulasque, vocatus vel non vocatus, volitat; ^unquam quietus, ^emper in
action, mo^uq^e perpetuo; singulis Conversationibus Superiorum immiscuit,
urget familiare colloquis, ut animos hominum expiscaretur; Quic quid inde ad
parts Conjuratorum commodi vel incommodi concernere advertit, Legato
Pontificio communicate, Secretioria, ipse ad Pontificem vel Cardinalem
Ba^ba^inum perscribit. In summa, cuivis societati sese adglutinat, nullum
ve^bum effari potest, quod ipse non arripiat and ad parts suas accommodet.
Quicquid interea temporis expiscatus, in catalogum redigit, and quavis Aestate
ad Consistorium generale Jesuitarum Politico^u^ quod in Provincia Wallensi
secreto concurrit, hospes acceptus de^ert. Ibi tacit consilia cuduntu^ quae ad
convulsionem status Ecclesiastici, turn Politici, Regni utriusque sunt
aptissima.

XIIII. Capitaneus Reda Scotus, habitans in platea Longaker, prope tabernam
Angeli, Jesuita saecularis, quiob detestandum officium praestitum (quo
ministrum quendam Ecclesiae, incitamentis dulcibus ad religionem Papisticam,
tota cum familia ipsius perverterat, filia ipsius in uxorem ducta) pro repensa
obtinuit reditus vel vectigal Butiraceum, quod rustici sibi praestare tenentur,
adquisitum ipsi ab rege, per nonnullos Societatis praecipuos; cui stimulus
nunquam deficit, quo in officio constans de^ineatur. In ipsius ae^ibus Rei
totius peragitur Negotium, ubi Societas quae in Regem and dominum
Archiepiscopum, regnumque utrumque conjuravit, plerumque diebus singulis
concurrit; Die vero expeditionis tabellarii, quae ordinary est dies veneris,
tanto frequentiores, tum enim omnes exploratores convenient, quae quisque ea
hebdomada expiscatus est, in commune conferunt; qui ut extra suspitionem sint,
secreta sua per Tobiam Mathei vel ipsum Redam, ad Legatum Pontificium,
amandant; ipse, fasciculum compactum quem ab exploratoribus nundinatus est,
Romam transmittit.

Apud eundem Redam deponuntur literae Roma illatae, sub titulis and nominibus
fictis, quae per ipsum singulis ad quos spectant traduntur, illorum enim omnium
and singulorum nomina ipsi sunt cognita.

Eadem ipsa occasion adferuntur etiam literae, sub coperta Patris Philippi
(ipso tamen rerum nescio) a quo conjuratis dstribuuntur.

Habetur in illis ipsis aedibus Sacellum publicum; cui Jesuita ordinarius
consecrat, ibidemque habitat. In dicto Sacello missae celebrantur quotidie a
Jesuitis* Baptism^que liberis domesticis and nonnullorum conjuratorum
inservitur.

Qui in nominatis aedibus concurrunt, Rhodis vel Equis, frequenter habitu
Politico, magnoque Comitatu, quo palliantur ne innotescant, Jesuitae tamen
sunt, and membra societatis conjurata.

XV. Hoc caetu contribuitur ab omnibu^ Papistis Angliae, ne quidquam ad
promovendum susceptum negotium de^^ciat. In quem fiscum, unica vidua
proprietaria olim aedium quas modo Secretarius Windebanck inhabitat, ante
triennium defuncta 40000 librarum Anglicarum, contulit; sic and alii etiam
citravires faciunt, modo ad optatum finem* promoveatur negotium.

XVI. Praeternominatas Eedes, etiam pe^ alia loca secretiora fiunt
conventicula, de quibus ne inter se quidem fidunt, met^ ne dispatentur.
Convocantur primo ad certa diversoria singuli (alter alterius inscius) hinc per
exploratores ad locum ubi convenire debent, singuli deducuntur, ignari alias
ubi conventuri sint, ne forte insperato obruantur.

XVII. Comitissa'd Arondel, strenua Pontificiae Religionis propugnatrix, ad
Reformationem universalem omnes nervos intendit, quicquid ad aulam regis*
secret vel aperte verbis vel factis geritur, Legato Pontificio infinuat, cum
quo ad minimum ter de die, modo in Aedibus Arondelianis, jam ad aulam vel
Tarthalae cum ipso congreditur; Ex ungue talia vix exugit.

Most illustrious and Reverend Lord.
WE have willingly and cordially perceived, that our offers have been
acceptable both to his Royal Majesty, and likewise to your Grace. This is the
only Index to us, That the blessing of God is present with you, whereby a spur
is given, that we should so much the more cheerfully and freely utter and
detect those things whereby the hazard of both your lives, the subversion of
the Realm and State both of England and Scotland, the tumbling down of his
Excellent Majesty from his Throne, is intended. Now least the Discourse should
be enlarged with superfluous circumstances, we will only premise some things
which are merely necessary to the business.

They may first of all know, that this The quality of the discovere^ and meane^
inducing him to reveal this plot.
good man, by whom the ensuing things are detected, was borne and bred in the
Popish Religion, who spent many years in Ecclesiastical dignities, At length
being found fit for the expedition of the present Design, by the counsel and
mandate of the Lord Cardinal Barbarino, he was adjoined to the assistance of
Master Cuneus ( The Popes Nuncio then in England.
Cun) by whom he was found so diligent and sedulous in his Office, that hope of
great promotion was given to him. Yet he, led by the instinct of the good
Spirit, has, howsoever it be, contemned sweet promises, and having known the
vanities of the Pontifician Religion (of which he had sometime been a most
severe defender) having likewise noted the malice of those who fight under the
Popish banner, felt his Conscience to be burdned; which burden that he might
ease himself of, he converted his mind to the Orthodox Religion. Soon after,
that he might exonerate his Conscience, he thought ^it, that a desperate
Treason, machinated against so many souls, was to be revealed, and that he
should receive ease if he vented such things into the bosom of a friend: which
done, he was seriously admonished by the said friend, that he should show an
example of his conversion and charity, and free so many innocent souls from
imminent danger. To whose monitions he willingly consented, and delivered the
following things to be put in writing, out of which the Articles not long since
tendered to your Grace, may be clearly explicated and demonstrated.

1 First of all, Four sorts of Jesuits.
that the hinge of the business may be rightly discerned, it is to be known,
that all those factions with which all Christendom is at this day shaken, do
arise from the Jesuitical offspring of Cham, of which four orders abound
thorowout the world.

Of the first Order are Ecclesiastics, whose office it is to take care of
things promoting Religion.

Of the second Order are Politicians, whose office it is by any means to shake,
trouble, reform the state of Kingdoms and Republikes.

Of the third Order are Seculars, whose property it is to obtr^de themselves
into Offices with Kings and Princes, to insinuate and immix themselves in Court
businesses, bargains and sales, and to be busied in civil affairs.

Of the fourth Order are Intelligencers ( or spies) men of inferior condition,
who submit themselves to the A good caveat to Nobles and Gentlemen to beware
they entertain not a Jesuit or Romish spy in their houses in stead of a
servant.
services of great men, Princes, Barons, Noblemen, Citizens, to deceive ( or
corrupt) the minds of their masters.

2. A Society of so many Orders, the We had need look about, when so many
active Traitors are harbored among us, even perchance at this present,
Kingdom of England nourishes: for scarce all Spain, France, and Italy, can
yield so great a multitude of Jesuits, as London alone; where are found more
then 50 Scottish Jesuits. There the said society has elected to it self a
seat of iniquity, and has c^nspired against the King, and the most faithful
to the King, especially the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and likewise against
both kingdoms.

3. For it is more certain then certainty it self, Therefore both Kindoms need
look to themselves.
that the forenamed society has determined to effect an universal reformation
of the Kingdom of England and Scotland. Therefore the determination of the
end, necessarily infers a determination of means to the end.

4. Therefore to promote the undertaken Villainy, Strange that such a society
should be erected under the Defender of the faith.
the said society dubbed it self with the Title of, The Congregation of
propagating the Faith; which acknowledges the Pope of Rome the Head of the
College, and Cardinal Barbarino his substitute and Executor.

5. The chief Patron of the society at London, A strange world when a Popes
Legate shall be openly harbored so near the King and Court, and have
fr^e^ccesse to both without control.
is the Popes Legate, who takes care of the business; into whose bosom, these
dregs of Traitors weekly deposite all their Intelligences. Now the residence of
this Legation, was obtained at London, in the name of the Roman Ponti^e, by
whose mediation it might be lawful for Cardinal Barbarino, to work so much
the more easily and safely upon the King and kingdom. If the King truly hate
the Pope, it will make his Instruments less effectual, if they come in his
name.
For none else could so freely circumvent the King, as he who should be
palliated with the Popes Authority.

6. Master Cuneus did at that time enjoy the Office of the Popes Legate, Popes
Instruments are ever very active.
an Universal Instrument of the conjured society, and a serious Promoter of
the business, whose secrets, as likewise those of all the other
Intelligencers, the present goodman, the Communicator of all these things, did
receive and expedite whither the business required.

Cuneus set upon the chief men of the Kingdom, Strange it was that the chief
men should not set themselves against him and his, to send the^ packing hence;
especially that the King himself did it not when he thus tempted and assaulted
him.
and left nothing unattempted, by what means he might corrupt them all, and
in^line them to the pontifician party: he enticed many with various
incitements, yea, he sought to delude the King himself with gifts of Pictures,
antiquities, Idols, and of other vanities brought from Rome, which yet would
preva^le nothing with the King.

Having entered familiarity with the King, That a Popes Legate should be so
familiar with the King, and the King make much of him in steed of banishing
him, is a riddle.
he is often requested at Hampton Court, likewise at London, to undertake the
cause of the Palatine, and that he would interpose his Authority, and by his
intercession persuade the Legate of Colen, that the Palatine in the next Diet to
treat of peace, might be inserted into the Conditions; which verily he
promised, but performed the contrary. He writ indeed, that he had been so
desired by the King concerning such things, yet he advised not that they should
be consented to, lest peradventure it might be said by the Spaniard, that the
Pope of ROME had patronized an heretical Prince.

In the mean time, Cuneus smelling The Archb. therefore, and he, had some
familiarity, and acquaintance at first.
from the Archbish. most trusty to the King, that the Kings mind was wholly
pen^ulous (or doubtful.) Resolved, That he would move every stone, and apply
his forces, that he might gain him to his party: Certainly confiding, that he
had a means prepared. For he had a command to This offer appears under the
Archbishops own hand in the Journall of his life.
offer a Cardinals Cap to the Lord Archbishop in the name of the Pope of ROME,
and that he should allure him also with higher promises, that he might
corrupt his sincere mind. Yet a fitting occasion was never given, whereby he
might insinuate himself into the Lord Archbishop ( for the Scorpion sought an
Egg: Free access was to be impetrated by the Earl and Countess of Arundel,
likewise by Secretary Windebanke: The intercession of all which being
neglected, he did fly the company or familiarity of Cuneus, worse then the
plague: But he kept not him from the Court.
He was likewise persuaded by others of no mean rank, well known to him,
neither yet was he moved.

7. Another also was assayed, Jesuits are both diligent and able to remove
their greatest opposites at Court from out of place and favor too.
who hindered access to the detestable wickedness, Secretary Cook, he was a
most bitter hater of the Jesuits, from whom he intercepted access to the
King, he entertained many (of them) according to their deserts, he diligently
inquired into their factions; by which means every incitement, breaththing a
magneticall (attractive) power to the Popish party, was ineffectuall with him;
for nothing was so dear unto him, that might incline him to wickedness.
Hereupon being made odi^us to the Patrons of the Conspiracy* he was endangered
to be discharged from his Office; It is admirable this faction should be so
powerfully predominant as to displace the greatest and faithfullest Officers.
it was labored for three years space, and at last obtained.

Yet notwithstanding there remained on the Kings part a knot hard to be untied,
for the Lord Archbishop by his constancy, interposed himself as a most hard
rock.

When Cuneus had understood from the Lord Archbishops part, Jesuits will be
sure to move hell, when they cannot prevail with Heaven.
that he had labored in vain, his malice and the whole Societies waxed boiling
hot: soon after ambushes began to be prepared, wherewith the Lord Archbishop
together with the King should be taken.

Likewise a sentence is passed against the King (for whose sake all this
business is disposed) because nothing is hoped from him, Jesuits cannot
endure neuters. If a man may be saved in any Religion, he may safely embrace
any and cleave close to none.
which might seem to promote the Popish religion (but especially when he had
opened his mind, that he was of this opinion, that every one might be saved in
his own religion, so as he be an honest and pious man.)

8. To perpetrate the Treason undertaken, the criminal The Bishops ty^^nny
against Puritans the best advantage, and greatest advancement of popes designs.
Execution at Westminster, caused by some writings of Puritans, gave occasion
of the first fire: which thing was so much exasperated and exaggerated by the
Papists to the Puritans, that if it remained unrevenged, it would be thought a
blemish to their Religion; The flames of which fire, the subsequent Book of He
means the Scottish Prayer book; the alterations whereof from the English, were
found in the Original copy, under the Archbishops own hand, when his chamber
was searched. The Jesuits love to fish when the Bishops trouble the streams
with their innovations and Popish Ceremonies* The Jesuits the plotters and
chief directors of the Scottish war.
Prayers increases.

9. In this heat, a certain Scottish Earl, called Maxfield, if I mistake not,
was expedited to the Scots by the Popish party; with whom two other Scottish
Earls, Papists, held correspondency: he ought to stir up the people to
Commotion, and rub over the injury afresh, that he might inflame their minds,
precipitate them to Arms, by which the hurtful disturber of the Scottish
Liberty might be slain.

10. There, by one labor, snares are prepared for the King; for this purpose
the present business was so ordered, that very many of the English should
adhere to the Scots; That the King should remain inferior in Arms, who (
thereupon) should be compelled to crave assistance from the Papists; which yet
he should not obtain, unless he would descend unto The King tied to
conditions by papists before they aided him

Northern parts, by open toleration.

of the Papists would succeed according to their desire. To which consent, if he
should show himself more difficult, there should be a present remedy at hand:

example of his The Jesuits it seems know very well King James was poisoned,

Father.

11. In this Scottish Commotion, the Marquess of Hamelton, often dispatched to
the Scots in the Names of the King, to interpose the royal Authority, whereby
the heat of minds might be mitigated, returned notwithstanding as often without
fruit, and without ending the business: His Chaplain at that time repaired to
us, who It seems some Noblemens Chaplains are but the Popes and Jesuits
intelligencers, if not their confederates.
communicated some things secretly with Cuneus. Being demanded of me injest,
Whether also the Jews agreed with the Samaritans? Cuneus thereunto answered;
would to God all Ministers were such as he: what you will, may be hence
conjectured.

12. Things standing thus, All foreign popish States contribute their best
assistance to reduce England to Rome.
there arrived at London from Cardinal Richelieu, Mr. Thomas Chamberlain, his
Chaplain and Almoner, a Scot by Nation, who ought to assist the College of the
confederate Society, and seriously to set forward the business, to leave
nothing unattempted, whereby the first heat might be exasperated. For which
service he was promised the reward of a A meet guerdon for such a service.

it lawful for him first to depart, until things succeeding according to his
wish, he might be able to return back again with good news.

13. Sir Toby Matthew a Iesuited Priest, Bishops Sons oftentimes the Popes
greatest Agents.
of the order of politicians, a most vigilant man of the chief heads, to whom a
bed was never so dear, that he would rest his head thereon, refreshing his body
with sleep in a chair for an hour or two, His industrious activity should
shame our slothfulness.
neither day nor night spared his machinations; a man principally noxious, and
himself the Plague of the King and Kingdom of England; a most impudent man,
who flies to all banquets, and feasts, called or not called; never quiet,
always in action and perpetual motion; thrusting himself into all
conversations of Superiors; he urges conferences familiarly, that he may fish
out the minds of men; what ever he observes thence, which may bring any
commodity or discommodity to the part of the conspirators, he communicates to
the Popes Legate; the more secret things he himself writes to the Pope, or to
Cardinal Barbarino. The protestants want of such mutual correspondency, and
intelligence is a great weakening to their cause. Let them learn Wisdom by
their Enemies.
In sum, he adjoines himself to any man's company, no word can be spoken, that
he will not lay hold on, and accommodate to his party. In the mean time,
whatever he has fished out, he reduces into a Catalogue, and every summer
carries it to the general Consistory of the Jesuits politics, which
secretly meets together in the Province of A fit place for their intelligence
and correspondency with Ireland, lying in the midst between both.

bound to render to him, procured for him from the King, by some chief men of
the Society, who never want a spur, whereby he may be constantly detained in his

it seems are very powerful at Court.

Upon the very same occasion, There are more Popish Chapels in and about
London, then are commonly known.

notwithstanding being ignorant of things) from whom they are distributed to the
Conspirators.

There is in that very ^use a publik Chapel, wherein an ordinary Jesuit
con^ecrates, and dwells there. In the said Chapel Masses are daily celebrated
by the Jesuits, and it serves for the baptizing of the Children of the House,
and of some of the Conspirators.

treasury, one Widow, owner of the Houses, wherein Secretary Windebanke now
dwells, dead above three Years since, bestowed forty thousand English
pounds, so likewise others contribute above their abilities, so as the
business may be promoted unto its desired end.

16. Besides the foresaid Houses, Jesuits are as wise as Serpents though not
so innocent as Doves.
there are Conventicles also kept in other more secret places, of which verily
they confide not even among themselves, for fear lest they should be
discovered. First, every of them are called to certain Innes, (one not knowing
of the other;) hence they are severally led by Spies to the place where they
ought to meet, otherwise ignorant where they ought to assemble, lest
peradventure they should be surprised at unawares.

thrice every week converseth with the Legate in Nocturnal conventicles, and
reveals those things which he thinks fit to be known; for which end, he
hired a house near to the Legates house, whom he often resorts to through the
Garden door, for by this vicinity, the meeting is facilitated.

conspiracy, are all most vigilant in the design. Some of those are enticed
with the hope of Court, others of Political Offices; Others attend to the
sixteen Cardinals Caps that are vacant; which are therefore detained idle for
some years, that they may impose a vain hope on th^se who expect them.

situated in Queenes-street, which the statue of a Golden Queen adornes. The
secular Jesuits have bought all this street, It seems their purses were
strong, and their hopes great.
and have reduced it into a guadrangle, where a Jesuitical College is tacitly
built, with this hope, that it might be openly finished, as soon as the
universal reformation was begun.

The Popes Legate uses a threefold Character or Cipher; His Majesty perchance
has learnt to write Characters from him, as appears by some of his late
intercepted Letters.
One wherewith he communicates with all Nuncioes; Another, with Cardinal
Barbaraino only: A third, wherewith he covers some greater secrets to be
communicated.

What soever things he either receives from the Society or other spies, those
he packes up together in one bundle, dedicated under this Inscription: To

WHEREIN.
1. THE Conspiracy against the King and Lord Archbishop is detected, and the
means whereby ruin is threatened to both, demonstrated.

2. The imminent dangers to both Kingdoms are rehearsed.

3. The rise and progress of that Scottish ^^re is related.

4. Means whereby these Scottish troubles may be appeased, are suggested: for
after the Scots shall know by whom and to what end their minds are incensed,

lest a middle party interpose, which seeks (the ruin) of both.

5. With what sword the Kings throat is assaulted, even when these stirs shall
be ended, Cunens his confession; and a visible demonstration, shows.

6. The place of the Assembly in the house of Captain Read is nominated.

7. The day of the eight days dispatch by Read and the Legate is prescribed.

8. How the names of the Conspirators may be known.

9. Where this whole Congregation may be circumvented.

10. Some of the Principal unfaithful ones of the Kings party are notified by
name; many of whose names occur not, yet their h^bitations are known; their
names may be easily extorted from Read.

If these things be warily proceeded in, the strength of the whole business
will be brought to light; so the arrow being foreseen, the danger shall be
avoided; which that it may prosperously succeed, the Omnipotent Creator grant.


The Archbishops indorsement with his ow^e hand.

Rece. October. 14. 1640.

The Narration of the great Treason, concerning which he promised to Sir
William Boswell, to discover against the King and State.

A further evidence and confirmation of some things in the Relation concerning
the Archbishop of Canterbury.
THe Relation of this horrid plot by a chief Actor in it, (with which the
Arch-Prelate acquainted the King, not many days before this Parliament began)
lay concealed among the Archbishops papers, without any prosecution of the
conspirators (for ought appears) who are since dispersed in part by the
Parliament, but neither dissolved nor taken off this plot, but become more
active in its prosecution, putting forth their last and utmost endeavors in
all places, to accomplish this their design, which they have almost brought to
maturity to our shame and grief, by new raised civil wars both in Ireland and
England.

Two things in this plot, which concern the Archbishop, may perchance seem
strange to different sorts of men.

First; That the Popes Legate should presume to tempt the Archbishop with the
offer of a Cardinals cap; and some friends of his will perchance affirm, that
certainly no such proffer was ever made unto him: but to put this out of
question, the Bishop himself under his own hand, among other memorials, in
the Iourn^ll of his life (then found by Mr. Prynne in his pocket) has these
two remarkable memorandums, Anno 1633. August 4. Sunday, news came to Court of
the Lord Archbishop of Canterburys death, and the King resolved presently to
give it me. That very morning at Greenenwich there came one to me SERIOUSLY,
and THAT AVOWED This must needs be the Legate, or one employed from him.
ABILITY TO PERFORM IT, and OFFERED ME TO BE A CARDINAL. I went presently TO
THE KING and ACQUAINTED HIM BOTH WITH THE THING AND PERSON. Aug. 17. (the same
month) Saturday I had A SERIOUS OFFER MADE ME AGAIN TO BE A CARDINAL; I was
th^^ from Court, but so soon as I came thither (which was Wednesday August
21.) I ACQUAINTED HIS MAJESTY WITH IT. But my answer again was, that somewhat
dwelt within me that would not suffer that TILL ROME were other then it is: so
that by his own Notes it appears, a Cardinals Cap was twice proffered him
very seriously, and that he acquainted the King with it; not by way of
complaint to crave justice against the party who durst presume to tempt him
with such a foreign dignity, to be the Popes sworn instrument; but, by way of
advice, and to sound His Majesty's opinion hereof* as his answer imports.
Neither did he absolutely di^claime the dignity it self, as if he might in no
case accept it, but conditionally, Till Rome should be other then it is now,
and then he would not refuse it. Indeed the Archbishop in his Page 171.
Reply to Fisher, challenges this title ( Putriarch of another world) as his
due, being given to his predecessor Anselm, and therefore could brook^ any
other Pope (in point of Sovereignty) to Lord it over him here; and this made
him refuse the Cardinals Gap^ But had he resisted the Legates landing or
conti^nance here, which he never did for ought appears, but entertained some
familiarity with him at first, though they afterward grew more strange; or
peremptorily refused the first offer with indignation, thrust out the Legate or
offerer of it by head and shoulders, prosecuted him (as he did poor innocent
Puritans) upon the Statute of 23^ Eliz. c. 1. as a Traitor, for attempting to
seduce him from his Alegiancy, and subject him to the Sea of Rome; or brought
him publicly into the Star Chamber or High Commission, as he did some others
for lesser pretended crimes and scandals, he had discharged the part of a good
zealous Prelate and Protestant; but here was no such proceeding in this case:
the very parties that tendered this Cap, presuming some good inclination in him
to accept it, and good affection to the Romish Church, which Conference with
Fisher, near the end.
he maintains to be a true Church, wherein men are and may be saved; and the
second proffer of the Cap following so soon at the heels of the first,
intimates; that the first was in such sort entertained by him, as rather
encouraged then discouraged the party to make the second; and his second
consultation with the King concerning it, insinuates, that the King rather
inclined to, then against it, or at leastwise left it arbitrary to him to
accept or reject it as he best liked. As for his lukewarm severity in
prosecuting Papists, it appears most lively by his Epistle to the King before
his Conference with the Jesuit Fisher, where he uses these speeches of his
^arriage toward them; God forbid that I should persuade a persecution in any
kind, or practice it in the least (against Priests and Jesuits.) For to my
remembrance I have not given him or his so much as cross language. Therefore
he is no great enemy to them: the edge of ^eale being wholly bent against
Puritans whom he prosecuted even to strong Cities, Countries withal manner of
Tortures.

The second thing which may seem strange to others, disaffected to him* is
this; that the Popes Legate and Jesuits should ever ^ate, or conspire his
death, unless he were an utter Enemy to all Popery, Papists and the Church of
Rome; which admits an easy answer: The truth is, the Bishop being very
pragmaticall and wilful in his courses, could not well brook pragmaticall,
peremptory Jesuits, who in Popish Kingdoms are in perpetual enmity with all
other orders, and they with them; they having been often banished out of See the
General Hist. of France in the life of H. 3. and 4.
France and other Realms by the Sorbonists, Dominicans and other orders, no
Protestants writing so bitterly against this Popish Order as themselves, as
some of their Priests, Dominicans, and other Friars have done: yea the Priests
and Jesuits in See the English Pope.
England were lately at great variance, and persecuted, and writ against one
another with much violence; This same then is no good argument that the
Arch-bi. held no correspondence with Priests and other Orders, can bear no
good affection to the Church of Rome, in whose superstitious Ceremonies he
outstripped most Priests themselves. What correspondency he held with
Franciscus de Sancta Clara, with other Priests, and Doctor Smith Bishop of
Calcedon, whom the Jesuits likewise have persecuted, and got excommunicated,
(though of their own Church and religion) is at large discovered in a Books
in^^^^led, The English Pope: and how well he approved of some Romish doctrines,
Alt^^s and Massing rites, is evident by the Scottish Common-prayer-booke, then
found in the Archbishops chamber, with all those alterations, wherein it
differs from the English, written with his own hand in the margin, some of
which smell very strongly of Popery; as namely, his blotting out of these words
at the delivery of the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, Take and eat this in
remembrance that Christ dyed for thee, and feed on him in thy heart by faith
with thankesgiving: Take and drink^ this in remembrance that Christ's blood was
shed for thee, etc. and leaving only this former clause (the better to
justify and imply a With which his Speech in Star Chamber agrees, There it is,
Hoc est corpus m^um, etc.
corporal presence of Christ in the Sacrament) The body of our Lord Jesus
Christ which was given for thee; The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was
shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. And this
popish Rubricke therein written with his own hand. The Presbyter during the
time of consecration shall stand AT THE MIDDLE OF THE ALTAR, where he may with
more ease and decency To elevate the Hos^ia, as Papists do^.
USE BOTH HIS HANDS, then he can do if he stand at the North end: with other
particulars of this kind. Moreover, in his book of Private devotions, written
with his own hand, he has (after the Romish form) reduced all his prayers to
Ca^^nicall hours, (many of them for his late good Lord and Master the Duke and
Duchess of Buckingham, and their family; and some against the Scotch Rebels, as
he styles them.) And in the forementioned Memorials of his life, written with
his own hand, there are these suspicious passages, among others, besides the
offer of the Cardinals-cap, An. 1631. I^n. 21. and 26. My nearer acquaintance
began to settle with Do. S. God bless us in it. I^nii 25. D. S. with me at

his own Warrants, and imprisoning those Officers who apprehended them)
confirms. About this time Dr. Theodor Price, Subdean of Westminster, a man
very intimate with the Archbishop, and recommended specially to the King by him
to be a Welsh Bishop (in opposition to the Earl of Pembroke, and his Chaptain
Griffith Williams, now an Irish Prelate;) soon after died a reconciled Papist,
and received extream^ Unction from a Priest: Noscitur ex comite. August 30.

gave (...) thanks for a business with which she trusted me; her promise then,
that she would be my friend, and that I should have immediate address to her,
when I had ^ccasion. All which considered, together with his Chaplains
licencing diverse popish Books, with their ^xpunging most passages against
Popery out of Books brought to the Press, and other particulars commonly
known, will give a true Character of his temper, that (...) is another
Ca^^ander, or middle man between an absolute Papist, and a real Protestant,
who will far sooner hug a popish Priest in his bosom, then take ^ Puritan by
the little finger; an absolute Papist in all matters of ceremony, pomp, and
external worship, (in which he was over^ zealous, even to an open bitter
persecution of all consci^^tious Ministers, who made scruple of them) if not
half an one at least, in Doctrinall (...). How far he was guilty of a
conditional voting the breaking up the last Parliament before this was called,
and for what end it was summoned; this other memorial under his own hand will
attest, Dec. 5 1639. Thursday, the King declared his resolution for a
Parliament, in case of the Scottish rebellion: the first movers to it were my
L. Deputy of Ireland* my Lord Marquess Hamilton, and my self: And a
Resolution voted at the Board to assist the King in extraordinary ways, if the
Parliament should prove peevish and Refuse, etc. But of him sufficient, till
his charge (now in preparation, and since transmitted to the Lords) shall come
in.

Observations on, and from the relation of this plot.
FFom the relation of the former Plot by so good a hand, our own three Realms,
and a^^ foreign Protestant States may receive full satisfaction.

First, that there has been a most cunning, strong, execrable conspiracy long
since contrived at Rome, and for diverse years together most vigorously pursued
in England with all industry, policy, subtilty, engines, by many active, potent
confederates of all sorts, all sexes, to undermine the Protestant Religion,
re-establish Popery, and alter the very frame of civil government in all the
Kings Dominions; wherein a most dangerous visible progress has been lately
made.

Secondly, That to effect this traitorous design, they have not only secretly
erected some Monasteries of Monks, Nuns, in and about London; but sent over
hither whole Regiments of most active subtle Jesuits, incorporated into a
particular new society, whereof the Pope himself is head, and Cardinal
Barbarino his Vicar: which Society was first discovered, and some of them
apprehended in their private College at Clerken-well (together with their
books of account Relics, and Massing Trinket^) about the beginning of the
second Parliament of this King; yet such power, favor, friends, they had then
acquired, that their persons were speedily and most indirectly released out of
Newgate without any prosecution, to prevent that Parliaments proceedings
against them, which examined this abuse, and illegal release. Since which,
this conjured society increasing in strength and number, secretly replanted
themselves in Queens-street and Long-acre, and their purses are now so strong,
their hopes so elevated, their designs so ripened, as they have there
purchased, founded a new magnificent College of their own for their
habitation, near the fairest buildings of Nobles, Knights, and Gentlemen, the
more commodiously to seduce them.

Thirdly, that these Jesuits and conspirators hold weekly, constant,
uninterrupted intelligence with the Pope and Romish Cardinals; and have many
spies or intelligence^ of all sorts about the King, Court, City, Noblemen,
Ladies, Gentlemen of quality, and in all quarters of the Kingdom, to promote
this their damnable Plot.

Fourthly, that the Pope for diverse late years has had a known avowed Legate,
C^^ by name, openly residing even in London, near the Court, of purpose to
reduce the King and his Kingdoms to the obedience of the Church of Rome; and
the Queen at least, another Legor at Rome trading with the Pope, to facilitate
the design, to wit, one Hamilton a Scot, who receives a pension out of the
Exchequer, granted to another Protestant of that name, who pays it over unto
him, to palliate the business from the peoples knowledge; by which means
there has been a constant allowed Neg^tiation held between Rome and England,
without any open interruption.

5. That the Popes Legate came over into England to effect this project, and
kept ^is residence here in London, for the better prosecution thereof by the
Kings own^ privity and consent. And whereas by Antiq. Eccles. Brit. p. 322.
Ead. lib. 1. and Fox Acts and Mon. Vol. 1. edit. ult. p. 926.
the ancient Law and Custom of the Real^e ^et in force, even in times of
Popery, no Legate whatsoever coming from Rome. ought to ^rosse the Seas, or land
in England, or any the Kings Dominions, without the Kings own Petition, calling
and request to the Pope, and before he had taken a ^olemne Oath or
Pr^te^station, to bring and attempt nothing in word or deed, to the prejudice
of the Rights, Privileges, Laws and Customs of the King and Realm. This Legate,
for ought appears, was here admitted without any such cautionary Oath, which
would have crossed the chief end of his legation, which was, to prejudice all
men, and our Religion too.

Yea, whereas by 23. Eliz. c. 1. 35. Eliz. c. 1. 3. Iac. c. 3. 4, 5.
the Statutes of the Realm, it is made no less then high Treason for any
Priests, Jesuits, or others, receiving orders or Authority from the Pope of
Rome, to set footing in England, or any the Kings Dominions, to seduce any of
his Subjects to Popery: and Popish Recusants (much less then Priests, Jesuits,
and Legates) ought not to remain within ten miles of the City of London, nor
come yet into the King or Princes Courts, the better to avoid such traiterous
and most dangerous Conspirators, Treasons, and attempts as are daily divised
and practiced by them against the King and Commonweal. Yet notwithstanding,
this Popes Legate, and his confederates, have not only kept redence for diverse
years, in or near London and the Court, and enjoyed free liberty (without
disturbance, or any prosecution of the Laws against them) to seduce his
Majesty's Nobles, Courtiers, Servants, Subjects every where, to their grief
and prejudice; but likewise had familiar access to, and conference with, the
King himself, (under the name, notion, authority of the Popes Legate) by all
Arts, Policies, Argument to pervert and draw him, with his three Kingdoms,
into a new subjection to the Sea of Rome, as See 1. and 2. Phil. and Mary, c. 8.
Cardinal Pool, the last Popes Legate extant in England before this, in Queen
Mary's reign, reconciled her and the Realm to Rome, to their intolerable
prejudice. An act so inconsistent with the Laws of the Realm, with his
Majesty's many ancient and late Remonstrances, Oaths, Protestations, to
maintain the Protestant Religion, without giving way to any backsliding to
Popery, in such sort as it was maintained and professed in the purest times of
Q. Elizabeth, etc. as may well amaze the world, which ever looks more at real
Actions, then verbal Protestations.

6. That the Popish party and Conspirators, have lately usurped a sovereign
power, not only about the Laws and Magistrates of the Realm (which take no
hold of Papists, See the Royal Popish Favorite.
but by the Parliaments late care against them here) but even over the King
himself; who either cannot, or dares not (for fear, perchance, of poisoning,
or other assassination) oppose or banish these horrid Conspirators from his
Dominions and Court, but has a long time permitted them (by virtue of his
marriage articles,) to prosecute this plot without any public opposition or
dislike, by whose powerful authority and mediation, all persons may easily
divine. Alas! what shall become of the poor sheep, when the Shepherd himself,
not only neglects to chase and keep out these Romish wolves, but permits them
free access into, and harbor in the sheepfold, to assault, if not devour, not
only his flock, but Person too? Either Saint Ioh. 10. 10. 11, 12, 13.
John was much mistaken in the Character of a good Shepherd, and prescribing
this injunction against such seducers, 2 Ioh. 10. 11.
If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into
your house, neither bid him God speed: for he that bids him God speed, is
partaker of his evil de^ds* And the Gratian cause. 23.
Fathers, the Canonists deceived in this Maxim, Qui non prohibet malum quod
potest, jubet: or else the premises cannot be tolerated or defended by any who
profess themselves enemies or opposites to the Pope, Priests, or Church of
Rome; or true Defend^rs of the Protestant reformed Religion.

7. That these conspirators are so potent, as to remove from Court and publiqu^
Offices, all such as dare strenuously oppose their plots, (as the example of
Secretary Cook, with other Officers lately removed in Ireland, the Articles of
Pacificatio^ there lately made with the Rebels, evidence) and plant others of
their own party and confederacy, both in his Majesty's Court, Privy
Council, Closet, Bedchamber if not Bed, and about the Prince, to corrupt them:
And how those that are the environed with so many industrious potent seducers
of all sorts, who have so many snares to entrap, so many enticements to
withdraw them, both in their Beds, Bedchambers, Closets, Councels, Courts,
where ever they go or come, should possibl^ continue long untainted,
unseduced, without an omnipotent protection (of which none can be assured, who
permits or connives at such dangerous temptations) is ^ thing scarce credible
in divine or humane reason, if Genesis 3.
Adams, 1 King* 11.
Solomon's, and other Apostacies by such means, be duly pondered. He who sails
in the midst of dangerous rocks, may justly fear, and expect a Qui amat
periculum peribit in (...).
wrack.

8. That the late Scottish troubles, wars, were both plotted and raised by
these Jesuitical Conspirators, of purpose to force the King to resort to them
and their Popish party for aid of Men and Money against the Scots; and by
color thereof to raise an Army of their own, to gain the King into their
power, and then to wi^ or force him to what conditions they pleased; who must
at leastwise promise the^ an universal toleration of their Religion throughout
his Dominions, ere they would yield to assist him. And in case they conquer or
prevail, he must then come ful^ly over to their party, or else be sent packing
by them with a poisoned Fig to another world, as his Father (they say) was;
(its likely by their instruments or procurement, they are so conusant of it,
though it might not be examined when complaine^ of in open Parliament by the
Commons, but the Assembly rather dissolved, then (...) death discussed) and
then the Prince, yet young, and well inclined to them already b^ his education,
will soon be made an obedient son of the Church of Rome. Thus the Relator, a
chief actor in this pre-plotted Treason, discovers. And if his single
test^mony (though out of an wounded conscience) will not be believed alone, the
ensuing circumstances will abundantly manifest, the Scottish wars to be plotted
and directed by them; For Con the Popes Legate, Hamilton the Queens Agent,
mo^^ of the Jesuits then about London, Captain Read their Host, the Lord
Sterling Chamberlain, Cardinal Richelleiu his Agent, with other chief actors
in the plot^ being all Scots, and employing of Maxfield, and he two other
active Popish Sco^ Lards, in raising these tumults; the Earl of Arundel
(another principal member of this conspiracy, being by their procurement made
General of the first Army against the Scots, and most of his Commanders
Papists; the Papists in a^ counties of England (upon the Queens Letters
directed to them) contributin^ large sums of Money, besides Men, Arms and
Horses to maintain this wa^ (for which Master Squire of Shoreditch highly
commended them in the Pulpi^ as the Kings best Subjects: See Master Whites
first Century of scandalous Priest^ P. 25) Sir Toby Matthew (the most
industrious conspirator, in the pack) makin^ a voyage with the Lord Deputy
into Ireland, to stir up the Papists there to contr^bute Men, Arms, Money, to
subdue the Scottish Covenanters; yea, Marquess Hamiltons own Chaplain
(employed as the Kings Comissioner to appease these Scots) holding
correspondency with Con, and resorting to him in private, to impart the secrets
of that business to him, the general discontent of the Papists and
conspirators upon the first pacification of those troubles, which they soon
after infringed, and by new large contributions raised a second Army against
the Scots, when the English Parliament refused to grant Subsidies to maintain
the war. All these concurring circumstances compared with the relation, will
ratify it without dispute, that this war first sprung from these conspirators.

9. That the subsequent present Rebellion in Ireland, and wars in England,
originally issued from, and were plotted by the same conspirators. For the
Scottish war producing this settled Parliament beyond the conspirators
expectation, which they foresaw would prove fatal to this their long agitated
conspiracy, if it continued undissolved; thereupon some Popish Irish
Commissioners coming over into England, and confederating with the Duchess
of Buckingham, Captain Read (now a prisoner in the Tower, and taken in the
field in actual rebellion in Ireland) and other of these conspirators, who
afterward departed secretly into Ireland, they plotted an universal
Rebellion, surprisall and Massacre of all the Protestants in that Kingdom:
which, though in part prevented by a timely discovery, which secured Dublin,
and some few places else; yet it took general effect in all other parts, to
the loss of above an hundred and forty thousand Protestants lives, there
massacred by them. And finding themselves likely to be overcome there by the
Parliaments Forces sent hence, and from Scotland, to relieve the Protestant
party; thereupon to work a diversion, they raised a civil bloody war against
the Parliament here in England, procuring the King (after Endymion Porter, a
principal conspirator in the Plot, had gained the custody of the great Seal
of England) to issue out diverse Proclamations under the great Seal, proclaming
the Parliament themselves Traitors and Rebels, yea to grant Commissions to
Irish and English Papists (contrary to his former proclamations) to raise
Popish forces both at home and in foreign parts for his defense, as his
trustiest and most loyal Subjects; to send Letters and Commissions of favor
to the Irist Rebels, and hinder all supplies from hence to the Protestant
party. And withal, they procured the Queen, by the Earl of Antrim^ and
Duchess of Buckinghams mediation, to send Ammunition to the Irist Rebels, and
to attempt to raise an insurrection in Scotland too, as the Declaration of the
rise and progress of the Rebellion in Ireland, more largely discovers: since
which, his Majesty has condescended to Articles of Pacification with these
Rebels contrary to an act of Parliament, and both Houses consents (wherein they
are declared His Majesty's GOOD So are the Shrewesbury printed copies.
Catholic Subjects of Ireland, and no Rebels at all) and has sent for many
thousands of them into England to massacre the Protestant English here, and
fight against the Parliament, as they did in Ireland heretofore. Seeing then
all may clearly discern the exact prosecution of this plot carried on in all
these wars by the conspirators therein particularly nominated; by the Queen and
Popish party in all three Kingdoms, and by Papists in foreign parts (who
have largely contributed Men, Money, Arms, Ammunition, to accomplish this
grand design, through the instigation of those conspirators in this plot, who
are gone beyond the Seas) and have lately caused public Proclamations to be
made in Bridges, and other parts of Flaunders, in ^uly last, (as appears by
the Examination of Henry May, since seconded by others, That all people who
will now give ANY MONEY TO MAINTAIN THE ROMAN CATHOLICS IN ENGLAND, should
have it re-payd them again in a years time, with many thanks;) the whole
world must of necessity, both see and acknowledge (unless they will renounce
their ownn eyes and reason) that this conspiracy and plot, is no feigned
imposture, but a most real perspicuous agitated treachery, now driven on
almost to its perfection, the full accomplishment whereof (unless Heaven
prevent it) the Catholics of England expect within the circuit of one year,
as the forenamed Proclamations intimate.

10. That no settled peace was ever formerly intended, See the Royal Popish
favorite, where it is largely proved.
nor can now be futurely expected in England or Ireland, without an universal
public toleration (at the least) of Popery, and a repeal and suspention of
all Laws against it; this being the very condition in the plot which the King
must condescend to, ere the Papists would engage themselves to assist him in
these wars thus raised by them, for this end: and that none may doubt this
verity; the late most insolent bold demands of the Irish Rebels in the Treaty
with them, the most favorable Articles of Pacification granted to them, the
present suspention of all laws against Priests and Recusants in all Counties
under his Majesty's power; the uncontrolled multitudes* of Masses in his
Armies, Quarters, Wales, the North, and elsewhere; the open boasts of Papists
every where, the introducing of thousands of Irish Rebels, and other Fugitives,
to extirpate the Protestant Religion, most really proclaim it: And if the
King, after all their many years restless labor, plots, costs, pains, and
pretended fidelity to his cause against the Parliament, should deny these
Merit-mongers, such a diminutive reward as this is, (the very least they will
expect*) now they have him, the Prince and Duke, within their custody, Bristol,
Chester, Ireland, Wales, most of the Western parts, and all his Forces in
their power, this Discoverer (an eye and ^are-witnesse of destiny from the
Legates own vaunt, will inform his Majesty and all his Protestant Subjects
(who will tremble at the very apprehension of it) that they have an Indian
poisoned Nut reserved for him amongst this Jesuitical society; or if it be
lost, a poisoned Knife perchance, or some other Instrument, to dispatch him out
of the World, and so to get the possession, protection of the Prince, whom they
will educate in their Antichristian Religion; which how possible, how probable
it is for them (considering their present power and endeavors to effect it,

King James himself (as the Legate boasted) may inform his Majesty, and all
his faithful Protestant Subjects, (especially such as by their confederating
with them in these their wars, have done naught, but executed, advanced their
forenamed designs, whom it concerns now very nearly to prevent, if possible,
such a sad Catastrophe of that bloody Tragedy, which has been acted overlong
in Ireland and England by these Conspirators fore-plotted treasons. The
execrable horridness and reality whereof, made the very Discoverer of the
Plot, out of remorse of conscience, to desert the Conspirators, conspiracy,
and that bloody Religion which begot it; and therefore should much more incite
all such in his Majesty's Army, who are cordially faithful to their
Sovereign, Religion, Country, Posterity, and have hitherto ignorantly acted
these conspirators treasonable designs, under color of serving the King; to
consider with remorse of conscience, whose Instruments they have thus long
been, whose treasons they have ripened, what Protestant blood they have shed,
how much they have weakened, impoverished, betrayed their own Protestant party,
who have really stood for God, Religion, King, Country, Parliament, against
these Romish conspirators; and what hopes, what advantages they have given
these confederates, both in England and Ireland, to overtop, suppress, and ere
long, utterly to extirpate the Protestant Religion, themselves, and all other
cordially pro^essing it, as they have done many thousands of them already. And
then upon all these sad, most serious considerations (the very thoughts whereof
should cause their souls to bleed and tremble) speedily to desert these
traiterous Papists, ere they get all into their power, and unite all their
heads, hearts, hands, forces to the Parliaments party, who had so good cause to
take up defensive arms, to prevent the imminent ruin, which otherwise is like
to befall both King, Kingdom, Religion, Parliament, Liberty, Property,
Posterity, ere we be aware; especially, since the most cowardly unworthy
yielding up of Bristoll, a fit Inlet for the maligant Welsh Papists, Irish
Rebels, (who have conspire to come over hither with all expedition, and are
lately landed here in great multitudes since the pacification made with them)
to cut all our throats.

11. That those Protestants who now side with Popish conspirators, when they
have accomplished their designs, whatsoever they may now fancy to themselves,
shall find no more mercy or favor from them, then the greatest Roundheads, if
they comply not with them in all things, and even in Popery it self; for if
they will not spare the Kings own person and life, after so many favors,
graces extended to them, (as they will not, if we believe this Relation, or the
late story of King Henry the fourth of France, yet fresh in memory) what
inferior person can think to be secure, to fare better then the King himself?
And if Con the Legate, to insinuate himself into the Kings and Palatines
favors at the first, when he had no interest in them, would not so much as
advi^e the Legate of Colen, to mediate for the Palsgrave, lest peradventure the
King of Spain should report, that the Pope had patronized an here^^^all
Prince, as the Rela^ion attests, though he promised the King effectually to do
it; How can Prince Rupert, Maurice, (or any other Commanders) in the Kings
Army, when they have fully accomplished the Popes, and these his Instruments
designs (under whose banner they ignorantly, yet really militate and promote
his cause, in steed of the Kings and Kingdoms, to whom they and theirs have
been so much engaged) hope to receive the least dram of favor, pity, muchlesse
any recompense from the Pope and Popish party, if they continue heretics
still, notwithstanding all their present goodly promises? Will they (think^
you) part with any other inheritances to them, then, who will not so much as
now mediate for them to regaine their own? Will these who have butchered so
many thousands of innocent Protestants in Ireland, in England, even before they
were sure of the day, without any provocation given; spare any mothers son of
them alive, if they once erect their Trophies over them? Certainly the
experience of all former ages compared with the present, may fully resolve all,
that the very (...). 12, 10.
tender mercies of these wicked ones, will be naught but extreme cruelty; and
if they prevail, we all must perish without distinction sooner or later,
unless we will turn Apostates, and lose our Religion, God, Heaven, souls,
to save our transitory lives.

Finally, therefore, let the serious consideration of all the premises instruct
us, to learn wisdom from these our adversaries; let their indefatigable
industry, subtle policy, sincere fidelity, cheerful constancy, bountiful
liberality, fraternall unanimity, undaunted magnanimity, indissolvable
confederacy, and uninterrupted pertinacie in prosecuting, establishing,
propagating their Antichristian Religion, Treasons, designs, excite all
Protestants (according to their several late Covenants and Protestations much
forgotten) to equalize, if not transcend them in all these, in defending,
securing, propagating our true Christian Religion, protecting our King,
Kingdoms, Parliament, Laws, Liberties, Posterity, all we yet have, or
hereafter hope for, from that imminent ruin, which these Popish conspirators
threaten to them. Forewarned fore-armed; if now we perish through our own
private dissentions, folly, cowardice, covetousness, treachery, security, or
monstrous credulity, that these conspirators and Papists now in Arms, fight
only for the King, and establishment of the Protestant Religion, as it was in
Queen Elizabeth's days, (against whom they plotted so many Treasons, even for
her very Religion, and also the powder plot since, against King James, and the
whole Parliament,) our blood shall rest upon our own heads, who would not take
timely notice of our incumbent dangers, nor suddenly prevent them whiles we
might.

YO have read before in the plot it self, what an active instrument Captain
Read was, in promoting this conspiracy of the Jesuits; and how he was
entrusted with the dispatch and delivery of all their Letters and Packets of
intelligence, and his house the ordinary randevouze where they weekly met; yet
see what a Protection this desperate Traitor obtained from his Majesty, to
secure him against all apprehensions and prosecutions to advance this design,
recorded in the Clerk of the Peace hi^ Book for Middlesex in open sessions,
for his greater immunity, and in the Crown Office.

By the King.
Whereas We have received good testimony of the Loyalty and Duty of Our trusty
and welbeloved Captain, John Read; and because he may be subject to the
penalty of the laws for Recusancie. These are to signify, that We are
graciously pl^ased to extend Our special Grace toward him: and do hereby
will command, that no Indictment, Presentment, Information, or Suit in Our
name, or in the name of any other, be henceforth commenced, prosecuted, or
accepted against him, by any of Our Officers or Subjects whatsoever, for or
concerning Recusancie: and if any such shall happen, then Our will and pleasure
is, that upon sight hereof the same shall be discharged and made void, or
otherwise not prejudicial to him.

Given under Our Signet at Our Court at Theobals the 13. day of July, in the
10th. year of Our Reign. To all and singular Our Judges of Assize, Justices
of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Clerks of Assize and Peace, Bayliffes,
Constables, Informers, and all other Our Officers and Ministers, whom it does,
or may concern, and to every of them.

The Examination of Henry Mayo.
WHo says, That on Thursday last, being the twentieth of July, one thousand
six hundred forty three, he being at Bridges in Flanders, heard Proclamation
made in Dutch, (who understands it very well) that all people within that City,
that would go to the Governors house, and give any Money to maintain the
Roman Catholics in England, they should have their Money re-paid them again
in a years time, with many thanks.
