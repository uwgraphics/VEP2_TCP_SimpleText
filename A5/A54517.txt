A true Relation of the present estate of IRELAND.
Noble Sir,
WE here rejoice much at the care and endeavors of the High Court of
Parliament in that Kingdom, to send us timely aid and assistance of men,
money, and ammunition against the Rebels; by whom otherwise this City had
been (ere this time) made a prey. The last forces that came over did us great
pleasure: We have also here landed forces from Scotland, under the command of
that valiant Soldier General Lesley, by whom likewise we have been much
strengthened and encourageed to defend our City and persons, families and
estates, which are begirt and besieged with at least 50000 Rebels, who have
received aid and relief from France and other parts, that much encourages
them: Yet are they not so terrible to us, or do we so much fear them, as the
treacherous designs privately practiced by Papists and their adherents,
inhabiting in the City; which dare to be so presumptuous as to wish publicly
prosperity to the Rebels; and speak in great favor of their cause, which
causes in us just suspicion of their evil intentions, confirmed also by the
open speeches of the Rebels, who have said, that if the City were not the
sooner yielded up to them, they hoped to find friends in the same, that would
set the same on fire. Also the daily revolting of Soldiers to the Rebels which
come from England, who outwardly pretend fair, but when employed in service
against them, they revolt to them; which puts us in great fear who to trust in
that employment: Therefore our hearty desires are that the Parliament would be
pleased to send over (as near as they can) both such Commanders and Soldiers
as are good Protestants, and altogether disaffected to the Romish Religion: and
that none may be sent over that have any kindred or alliances Papist Rebels,
fearing their taking part with the Rebels rather then against them, for the
rebellion yet daily so increases, that the Kingdom is yet in great danger of
utter destruction, if God in mercy prevent it not with sudden aid and
assistance: The Provinces of Lemster and Vlster are altogether in subjection to
the Rebels, of whom Sir Philemon Oneale is General; who has lately
constituted Colonel Richard Planquet Lieutenant General of Lemster, and most
of the North parts of this Kingdom are in their subjection. Master Francis
Moore of late has done valiant Acts in assaulting diverse of the Rebels, and
taking of the grand Traitor Art Roe Mac Mahon, at a Crete or Cottage near
Drogheda, whereof the Right Honorable Charles Lord Moore is Vicount. Yet
nevertheless that many overthrowes have been given the Rebels in diverse
places of this Kingdom, as well in the Provinces of Cork and Munster, as
Lemster, Vlster, and Dublin; yet do they increase in strength, and do great
damage and harm in all Countries where they have got head, with savage and
inhumane cruelties, that the most barbarous nations in the world (I believe)
have not done the like; God grant an end to their cruelties for Sion sake, and
his Gospel and true Religion sake, that these wicked enemies thereof, not
scarce deserving the name of humane creatures, may no more triumph over the
Saints and servants of God, and glory in their own wickedness.

We hear news that the Pope has sent to diverse Princes as Spain and France
to take Arms to defend their Religion; in assisting the Catholic Rebels in
Ireland, by invading the Kingdom with a powerful Army, or to invade England,
thereby to hinder the King and Parliament from sending any more aid hither, but
that all their endeavors may be taken up to defend themselves, and that
Kingdom, the Pope also, as credibly reported, has sent over a general pardon
for all that take Arms in defense of Popery, and have sent to their General,
Philemon Oneale, a Banner displayed, importing their quarrel is only in
defense of the Religion of the Pope and Saint Peter, and has sent him many
presents of his favor, to animate and encourage him to proceed in his intended
enterprises, and promised that nothing in his power lay should be wanting
toward their assistance and encouragements. There was a battle also fought
about a week agone between the Scots, English, and the Rebels, in the Province
of Dublin, which was fierce and cruel, the Rebels defending themselves
valiantly a long time, but at last was vanquished by the English and Scots,
there being about eight thousand of the Rebels slain and many taken Prisoners,
there being only one thousand of English and Scots together slain; this
battle held almost two days, the chief Commanders of the English was the Lord
Dungarvan, Sir Simon Harcoud, Sir William Cootes, and of the Scots General
Lesley, etc. Another such overthrow will much weaken the strength of the
Rebels, which we daily pray God would in his good time altogether subdue and
overthrow to their utter confusion, or turn their hearts to do that which is
right, and give them a sight of their errors, and disperate opinions in their
false idolatrous and superstitious worshipping of God, in their blind and
ignorant Religion: and thus much at this time to certify you of our present
condition.

As also their flight from thence upon the coming of Captain Pollard, and
some Scotch regiments against them, with the loss of the Town, and all the
ammunition to our English forces.

Upon the 10. of February, Anno Dom. 1642. the Rebels having lately apprehended
some eighteen Protestants in the Town of Oggersney, in the County of Munster,
carried them before the Lord Corton, who was chosen Lieutenant General of
their Horse to be examined as concerning their Religion, which they boldly
averred to be the Protestant faith, in which they resolved to live and die,
whereupon they were forthwith committed to prison, where they lay in a dungeon,
enduring great misery through the abuse of the soldiery that delighted in
nothing more than in tormenting them; the principal of all these Protestants
was Sir Edward Pellam who had a son in law (being a Recusant) eldest Captain of
a horse-troop in the regiment belonging to the Lord Autrim, who very earnestly
desired of the Lord Corton, Oneale, and the residue of Council of war, sitting
about that occasion, that he might stand as bail for his fathers appearance,
moving it with such zeal and earnest affection toward his father, that he had
almost obtained his request, until that one Dennis Carley Sergeant Major to
the said Regiment, and Captain Carley his nephew, with diverse other enemies to
the Protestants, persuaded the contrary, alleging that being an enemy to their
Religion and present proceeding, it might be a means to his escape, and the
other his son who pleaded for him likewise, who showed very little affection to
the Church of Rome to plead so much for a heretic, though he had been his
own father, therefore they desired that he might likewise be examined unless
he might be one of their confederacy, which they did, but nothing being found
wherein that to condemn him, nevertheless he was sentenced to be committed to
close prison, which the soldiers understanding of whom he was very much
beloved, and considering the injustice of the cause, came with one consent upon
the Council of war, and per fas aut nefas delivered him, withal falling into
such an abrupt mutiny, being instigated and egged forward by Captain Bolte,
whom they had freed, who was eager of revenge on his enemies, that they
desperately hurt Oneale, slew both the Carleyes, Captain Sartwell, and Captain
King, their companions, and three hundred soldiers: he in the mean time
getting through the press, gave intelligence to Captain Pollard commanding a
company of Scots, who with others came to the Town, upon the intelligence of
whose approach, the Rebels fled, notwithstanding they spared not to vent their
spleen upon the poor Protestants, whom they massacred and cut all to pieces,
leaving in the Town through haste and fear of being overtaken the most part of
their Arms, three small fieldpieces with their carriages, ten wagons with
ammunition, as also the trace horses to draw them, which proved the spoil to
the Scottish Protestants.

Dublin 17. 1642. Yours in all observance, to pleasure you hereafter, John
Peter's.

FINIS.
