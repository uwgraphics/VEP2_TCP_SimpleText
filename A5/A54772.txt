A POEM ON THE CORONATION OF King JAMES II. AND His Royl Consort QUEEN MARY.
By John Phillips Gent. Student of Lincoln's End.
AT last the early Birds with tunfuell Lays
Proclaimed the solemn, welcomest of Days,
But Phoebus rose not yet, since Charles was gone,
With whom he sat, he kept his Mourning on:
( Charles! Heaven's glad Burden now, and justest Pride,
Who sits Enthroned next his Great Father's side.)
And now the weeping Skies with Clouds overspread,
Paid its last Tribute to the Royal Dead,
The Sun broke out with an unusual Ray,
And with new Beams bedect the smiling Day;
He saw the incircled Heads, and darting down
Blessed with a Lambent heat the Dazzling Crown.
He saw the Pomp, and Blushing did confess
In adding Luster, He received no less.
The weighty Emblem of a Crown more bright
Lifts the Great Bearer higher from our sight;
Adds an Eighth Genius to the brighter Heaven,
But Fixst, not wandering as the other Sev'n.
Such is his Valor, and his vast Success,
You Would think him more a Man, were they but less;
But only Gods (like Mighty JAMES) are They
Who know no Limits to their Earthly sway.
But since to paint Perfection we cant' raise
Our Thoughts to equal height, he is less'ned by our Praise:
On then, Great Prince; with one united Ray
The Sun and you together Rule the Day;
While your Fair Consort dect with Paler Light
Successively with Phoebe Rules the Night.
Blessed with such rich Advantages as these
A JAMES and MARY, Victory and Peace;
How Happy Albion do thou seem to be!
Thy Fate is to be envied even by Thee.
FINIS.
