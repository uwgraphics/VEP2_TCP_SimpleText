A New years Gift to the TEMPLERS, On that Eminent Lawyer Sir Edmond Saunders,
His being Chosen Lord Chief Justice of England.
When Ploting Knaves from Justice fly away,
Then Loyal Templers shall come into Play;
When Rogues, and Traitors, dare not show their Face,
Then Honest men again shall come in place.
To the Tune of, Joy to the Bridegroom.

OLd Tony's fled, from Justice gone,
And all his shamming Plots are done;
The Plague is ceased and gone away,
Then let us make a Holy Day.
And to great Charles our Gracious King,
In joyful consorts let us sing.
[2]
To Amsterdam the Traytor's fled,
To save his false designing head;
Thither the holy Brethren crowd,
A Murrin scatter all the Brood.
That to great Charles our Gracious King
In joyful consorts We may sing.
[3]
At Hague they keep their Randezvou,
Like Crows this Carrion they pursue,
Waller and Willmore, all the crew,
With Starkey, Smith, the chase pursue.
Whilst to great Charles our Gracious King,
We in a joyful consort sing.
[4]
But now the Wolf is gone astray,
The harmless Sheep may sport and play;
When Traitors dare not show their face,
Then honest men shall come in place.
Who to great Charles our Gracious King
Will in a joyful consort sing.
[5]
While Tony with his Plots are fled,
And never more to show their head;
Renowned Saunder's to their grief,
Is made of England Justice Chief.
That Lawyers may rejoice and sing
In joyful consorts to their King.
[6]
To Temple this, and Templers Fame,
Shall purchase an Immortal name;
That Sovereign Justice Right and Law,
Should from those Crystal Fountains flow,
Let Templers then rejoice and sing
In joyful consorts to their King.
[7]
Brave Saunder's Lord Chief Justice named,
For Law and Justice so much Famed:
To the Subjects his due Rights will give,
To the King his just Prerogative.
Then to great Charles our Gracious King
In joyful consorts let us sing.
[8]
No more shall Shreives Whig-Juries blind,
And Loyalists shall Justice find;
Nor Ignoramus Law prevail,
A curse oth'Nation to entail.
But to great Charles our Gracious King
All shall in joyful consorts sing.
[9]
With me let all the Land rejoice,
That he has made this happy choice:
That Justice through the Land may flow,
And all find Justice with their Law.
While to great Charles our Gracious King
We may in a joyful consort sing.
[10]
Long live great Charles, and Royal James,
Of future Age the happy Themes,
To sit upon the British Throne,
When Tony and his Tribe are gone
Then to great Charles our Gracious King
In joyful consorts let us sing.
