TO THE WORSHIPFVLL his very Worthy Friend, RICHARD KNIGHTLEY ESQUIRE.
Worthy Sir,
MY purpose was, that (without any addition or alteration) this small Treatise
should have passed, as I had formerly composed it: but finding somewhat that I
judged useful, to the easier attaining of the Art, which before was omitted; at
the request of diverse of good judgment, I was persuaded rather to adventure
the breach of that promise, than to conceal that which might be useful to
many.

The manifold engagements I stand in to your Worship, require a better
retribution; but your favorable aspect to one as little deserving, has
enboldned me to crave of your Worship to countenance this, and the rather
because your experience in the Art, has already encouraged many to the study
of it.

I dare not so much injure your Worships virtuous inclination, as to fear the
acceptance of this poor expression of my thankefullnesse, seeing it is not
unknown to your Worship, nor to many thousands beside, that it has been
isntrumental for the good of the Church, and the perpetuating the memories (
as the smell of Lebanon) of many worthy men, who, though they now rest from
their labors, and their works have followed them: yet by this means the fruit
of their labors is continued with us. I desire your Worship to pardon my
boldness; and to pray for the increase of all blessings on your Worship, shall
be the employment of

Your Worships to be commanded, THO. SHELTON.

To the Reader.
I Am prevented for speaking much of the utility of this Art, by the experience
of many hundreds that have already learned it, that by this means are able
(like that heavenly Scribe, Mat. 13.52.) To bring forth of their Treasuries,
things both new and old: As also by the benefit that many thousands enjoy by
the works of many worthy Divines, which had perished with the breath that
uttered them, had not God, as out of Zebulun, Judge. 5.14. instructed some to
handle the pen of the writer; who may say of them as Baruch of Jeremiahs roll,
Ier. 36.18. He pronounced all these words to me; and I wrote them with ink in
the book: Besides the privilege that diverse enjoy in foraine parts, by using
Bibles and other books in this writing, without danger of bloody Inquisitours.

These and the like considerations move me to say the less: only let the
intelligent Reader judge how useful such a skill may be, by the learning
whereof so much time and labor is saved; whereby as much may be written in one
page as otherwise in six, and as much in the margent as the page: a skill
whereby those that have weak memories, may both easily preserve their own
conceits, that else would soon vanish, and be furnished with notions from
others. For the plainness of the rules, the easiness in learning, the speed
in writing, the facility in reading, let the discreet reader peruse, practice,
and judge

THO. SHELTON.

TO THE AUTHOR HIS Friend, upon his Art of SHORT-WRITING.
FOrtunate Art, by which the hand so speeds,
That words are now of slower birth than deeds!
Dissembling age, that faith so often breaks,
Learn hence to do more than the proudest speaks,
Speak not the Authors praise; his Art commands
Our tongues should be more cripled than our hands:
Nor can we escape (this spite his speed affords)
From being over-taken in our words.
What shall become of their Divinity,
Which scattered through two hours Tautologie,
Gathered by these quick Characters, must hen^e
T'indure the doom of such as can speak sense?
But that thine Art's a friend to repetition,
Their bourely breath, they would damned the next edition.
Print then that praise, which volumes cannot bold
But in thine own compendious figures told;
Figures, which makes us duller-handed think
Words from the speakers mouth dissolve to ink,
And fall upon thy papers; or thy quill,
Made of some nimble tongue, give thee this skill,
Still may that full-fledg'd pen with moisture spring.
Snatched from the Eagles, not the Gooses wing.
E. R. Mag. Art. Magd. Coll.

TO HIS INGENIOUS FRIEND Master Thomas Shelton, on his Art of SHORT-WRITING.
SVch is thy Art, that either thou alone
Comprised the Illiads in a nut, or none:
I Have read this often, yet scarsely did give credit,
(Except they self) that ever one man did it:
Yet now it is no wonder, when I see
Thou writ'st whole volumes in Epitome;
And with such speed, that with thy nimbler pen
Thou do anticipate the tongues of men:
So that if Plutarch lived, he scarce could tell
To find thee in thy Art, a Parallel,
Tho. Fancourt. Cantab. Col. Pet.

TO THE AUTHOR.
WHy should I praise thy Art in writing, when
Thy Art and praise surmounts the praise of men?
For if thy way of writing had been shown
To ages past, Printing had never been known,
Nor the Invention sought or valued* when
The Press can scarcely over-runne thy Pen:
So that what honor's due unto the Quill,
Or glory unto those that have the skill
In fair Orthographie, their titles stand
As pages to attend upon thy hand.
Nath. Mason, G.C. Coll.

TO THE AUTHOR ON HIS EXQUISITE ART OF SHORT-WRITING.
WHat! write as fast as speak? what man can do it?
What! hand as swift as tongue? persuade me to it.
Unlikely tale! Tush, tush, it cannot be,
May some man say, that has not heard of thee.
This thou can do, this (SHELTON) thou have done:
Thy nimbler pen has many tongues outrun.
Therefore if any one of me demand
What hand's the best, I say, thy running hand.
Here in the proverb holds not, for thy haste
Is advantageous, it does make no waste:
Nor do thou envy others this thy Art,
But willingly do it to all impart:
And it is not sit that such a gemme should rest
Within the cabinet of a private breast.
On praise of thy Short-writing I could long
Insist; but I therein should do thee wrong.
This only I will add, whilst some desire
To praise thy skill, I rather will admire.
Steph. Jones, Coll. D. Joan.

THE ART OF Short-writing.
CHAP. I. General rules of abbreviation, observable in the use of this Art.
THe principal end of the Art of Short-writing being to write much in a little
time and room, it is not needful in every word to express every letter, but
only so many as may serve to sound the word, the rest may be left out as
superfluous: as for example, a may be left out in fear, dea^e, heaven b may be
left out in debt, lamb, tomb c may be left out in science, Scipio, acquit d
may be left out in judge, badge, wedge e may be left out in enter, end, else g
may be left out in strength, length h may be left out in ghost, inherit, Christ
i may be left out in f^uit, guide, plain k may be left out in acknowledge,
black l may be left out in palm, half, Psalm. n may be left out in condemn,
solemn o may be left out in double, deacon, beacon, p may be left out in
psaltery, psalm, empty s may be left out in isle, paganism, baptism t may be
left out in elect, reject, act u may be left out in plague, league, tongue w
may be left out in write, sorrow, know y may be left out in obey, say, nay.


2
Sometimes two letters or more may be left out, and yet the word sufficiently
sounded; as for example, ch may be left out in schism, and the like. gh may be
left out in might, naught, and the like. ugh may be left out in through,
borough, and the like. ou may be left out in labor, neighbor, and the like.


3
Sometimes a whole syllable may be spared in a word: as for example, For
vehement write vement etc. For Abraham write Abram etc. For victual write
vittell etc.


4
In the end of some long words, two or three syllables may be omited without
hinderance to the reading of them as for example, For incomprehensible write
in^ompr. For abominable write abomin. For transubstantiation write transubst.


5
Sometimes the letters that are ordinarily used in the writing of words, may
be changed for others of like sound, that are written shorter;

As for example.

F is sounded like ph, and may be written instead of them, as in these words,
For physic write fisick etc. For Pharisee, write farisee etc. For philosophy
write filosofie etc.


F is likewise sounded in the end of words like ugh, and may be written for
them: as, For enough write enuf etc. For cough write cof etc. For rough write
ruf etc.


K may be written for ch, when they have a like sound: as, For Patriarch write
patriark For melancholy write melankoly, For choler, write koler, etc.
X has the sound of diverse of the double consonants, and may be used in their
stead: as for example, it is sounded like cc in accept, accident cts in acts,
effects cks in flocks, stocks; for which write axept, axident, etc. for which
write ax, effex, etc. for which write siox, stox, etc.

and generally when s comes after k, they together have the sound of x, and x
is to be written for them.

6
The letter e may be left out in many words: sometimes in the beginning,
sometime in the middle, sometimes in the end of words.

In the beginning it may be spared, when the sound of it is drowned in the
sound of the next letter following, as it is always before x: as, For external,
write xternall, etc. For extent, write xtent, etc. For extract, write xtract,
etc.
Also as when it comes before m: as, For emphasis, write mphasis, etc. For
empty, write mptie, etc. For embrio, write mbrio, etc.


Or before n: as, For ensign, write nsigne, etc. For enter, write nter, etc.
For end, write nd, etc.


And in many words before s: as, For escape, write escape, etc. For establish,
write stablish, etc. For estate, write state, etc.


Sometime in the middle of a word e may be left out, when the sound of it is in
the next letter, as, For alteration, write altration, etc. For liberal, write
librall, etc. For contemn, write contm, etc. For flatter, write flatr, etc.


E in the end of a word may be left out, when it comes after l: as, For
eagle, write eagl, etc. For title, write titl, etc. For double, write doubl,
etc.


And always, when it serves only to produce the former vowell in the same
syllable, it may be left out: as, For were, write were, etc. For name, write
nam, etc. For those, write those, etc. For die, write di, etc.


7
When a consonant is doubled in a word, one of them may be spared: as for bb,
ff, ll, write b, f, l: as, For rabble, write rabble, etc. For affirm, write
afirme, etc. For collect, write colect, etc.


8
Sometimes in this Art, three or four words may be joined together as one
word; of which afterward.

9.
Lastly, in writing some sentences, whole words may be omitted, which yet in
the reading must be imply^d, especially in common known sentences as, for The
fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. may be written. The fear of
Lord beginning wisdom.

For, In the fullness of time God sent his Son, etc. may be written. In
fullness time God sent Son, etc,

They are not a few that have found benefit by this direction. Those that will
make use of it, must have discretion to know what words may be spared in
writing, and yet must be employed in the reading; for if any principal word be
left out, whereby the sense is maimed, instead of a help it will prove an
hinderance.

Again, it is only to be used when one is not able otherwise to write word for
word after the speaker.

CHAP. II. Of the letters of the Alphabet.
HAving in the former Chapter given some general directions, (which are of use
through out the whole Art) I com now to the particular rules; the first whereof
is the Alphabet of letters, which are to be learned perfectly, according to the
form expressed in the copy,

In the making of those letters, Place here the Alphabet.
each of them but x and y (which are not often used) are to be made at once,
without removing the pen from the paper.

I make one character for q and u, because they come always together:
whenever q is written, u immediately following it; as in queen, quiet,
quarter, quantity, etc.

These letters being so perfectly learned, that you can make and know any of
them without looking on the copy, proceed to the next.

CHAP. III. Of the double consonants.
THe double consonants are the very letters of the Alphabet, joined together
(except the four last) and therefore the learning of them is no charge to
memory, the letters being once learned.

In the making of these double consonants you may observe, that still the
second letter is joined where you end the former: Place here the double
consonants
as for example, to write bl, your b alone is thus [^], l alone thus [^] when
they are to be joined, draw l from the foot of b thus [^]. To write br, write
b as before, and then draw r out of the foot of b thus [^]. To write cl, c
alone is thus [^], l thus [^]: when you join them, draw l out of the foot of
c thus [^]: or thus [^] and so of the rest, as you may see in the copy of the
double consonants.

Double consonants To begin words. To end words.
bl ^ br ^ cl ^ cr ^ dr ^ dw ^ fl ^ fr ^ gl ^ gr ^ kn ^ pl ^ pr ^ sc ^ sk ^ sl
^ sm ^ sn ^ sp ^ st ^ str ^ tr ^ tw ^ ld ^ lk ^ lm ^ ln ^ lp ^ ls ^ lsi ^ lt ^
mp ^ nd ^ ng ^ nk ^ ns ^ ns^ ^ n^ ^ rd ^ rk ^ rl ^ rm ^ rn ^ rv ^ rs ^ rst ^ rt
^ ch ^ sh ^ th ^ wh ^
CHAP. IV. Of Vowels.
THE single Vowels are a, e, i, o, u, which in this Art are never expressed by
their proper characters, (unless when a Vowell begins a word, or else when
two vowels come together, of which see Chap. 5.) but are understood by certain
places, assigned them about the other letters: as for example.

The places of the Vowels.



The Vowels are placed about any letter, as you see them stand about these,

The place of a is just over the head of the letter; thus, ^.

The place of e at the upper corner on the right hand; thus, le.

The place of i against the middle of the letter on the right hand* thus, ^.

The place of o at the foot of the letter on the right hand; thus, lo.

The place of u just underneath the letter; thus ^.

About the characters that are flat, or lie even with the line, as p and n,
they are thus disposed;

The place of a is just over the middle of the letter: the place of u just
against it under the letter; the other three e, i, and o, on the right side one
under another.

About slope characters, as m, and t, they are placed thus

The places about any of the rest are easily observed.

CHAP. V. Of the use of the Vowels, and their places.
WHen a word begins with a vowell, the character of the vowell must be
expressed: as for example, to write art, the character of a must be written
thus [^]: the next letter r, being a consonant, must be joined to a thus [^]
and then t joined to r thus [^]. To write on, write o thus [^], and at the foot
of it join n thus [^]. To write eke, write e thus [^], and join k thus [^], as
in these. in ^ are ^ arc ^ us ^ ebb ^ odd ^
and the like.

If two vowels come together in the beginning of a word, and must both of
necessity be founded, write down the character of the former vowell, and set
the following consonant in the place of the latter vowell: as for example, To
write aid write the character of a thus [^], the next vowell being i, set d in
the room of it thus [^], to write eat, write e thus [^], the next vowell being
a, set t in the place of it thus [^] as in these, aim ^ air ^ ear ^ oar ^
out ^ ease ^
and the like.

When a word begins with a consonant, the vowell or vowells following are
not expressed by their characters, but employed by the places assigned them
about the consonant, and the next letter or letters following are set in the
place of the foregoing vowel. As for instance, to write ball, write b thus [^],
in the place of a write l disjoined thus [^]. To write bell, write b as before;
and l dis-joyned in the place of e thus [^]. To write bill, write b as before,
and set l dis-joyned in the room of i thus [^], boll, thus [^], bull, thus [^]:
as in these, bad ^ bed ^ bid ^ bod ^ bud ^ not ^ net ^ nit ^ not ^ nut ^
and the like.

If two consonants or more come together, and no vowell between them, they
must be joined together without taking off the pen: as for example, to write
blame, bl must be joined thus [^], then in the place of a write m thus [^], To
write break, write br thus [^], and in the place of e write k thus [^].

As in these, breadth ^ length ^ short ^ speech ^ whence ^ France ^
and the like.

Note that always when there comes any vowell, the pen is to be taken off, and
the letter after dis-joyned; but till you come at a vowel, all the consonants
that come together must be joined together.

When a word ends with a vowell, that vowell is understood by a tittle made
in the place of it: as to write me, write m thus [^], and a tittle in the place
of e thus [^]. To write die, write d thus [^], and a tittle in the place of i
thus [^]: as in these, say ^ we ^ cry ^ go ^ due ^
and the like.

If a word end with y, the character of y is not expressed, but a tittle set in
the place of i: as in these, my ^ why ^ by ^


CHAP. VI. Of diphthongs.
FOr diphthongs, some assign more places about characters, then for single
vowels; which has proved inconvenient in the writing, and bred much confusion
in the reading of what has been so written, as they from their own experience
have testified; it being indeed impossible exactly to observe 12. or fourteen
several places about a small character; for the avoiding of which
inconvenience, I observe only the places for the single vowels, and no more.

If it be demanded, how words shall be expressed wherein more vowels then one
come together;

I answer, if two vowels come together in the beginning of a word, observe that
rule, Chap. 5. If in the middle of a word, that is, after some other letters,
observe these rules.

First, Though two vowels come together, yet often times, one of them does
principally sound the word, and then the other may be spared: as in these words.

In dear leave out a and write dear, In heart leave out e and write heart, In
neither leave out i and write nether, In people leave out o and write people, In
guide leave out u and write gide.
Secondly, if two vowels come together, and must of necessity be both sounded
(as especially when the first vowell belongs to one syllable, and the latter to
another) then write the character of the latter vowel in the place of the
former; as to write lion, write l thus [^], in the place of the first vowell
which is i, write the character of o thus [^], and then join n at the foot of
o thus [^]. To write poet, write p thus [^], in the place of o write e thus
[^], and join t thus [^]: as in these, quiet ^ sion ^ caos ^
and the like

Or else make a tittle in the place of the former vowell, and write the
consonant or consonants following in the latter vowels place; as to write riot,
write r thus [^], make a tittle in the first vowels place, which is i thus [^],
and then in the place of the latter vowell o, write t thus [^]. To write Joel,
write j consonant thus [^], a tittle in the place of o thus [^], and l in the
place of e thus [^] as in these, dial ^ giant ^ duel ^
and the like.

CHAP. VII. Of I and V consonants.
THE letters j and v are sometimes vowels, sometimes consonants; the knowledge
whereof will not be unusefull in this Art of writing; therefore those that
know it not, may take these directions.

I is a consonant always in the beginning of a word, when another vowell
follows next after it, and it is sounded like g soft: as in these, jarre ^
judge ^ jewel ^ Job ^
and the like.

Also in the middle of a word, if a vowell follow it in the same syllable: As
in these, prejudice ^ reject ^ rejoice ^
and the like.

V is a consonant when it comes before another vowel, in the same syllable,
and is sounded like f, but somewhat softer: as in these, virtue ^ vial ^
vesture ^ deliver ^
and the like.

When they be Consonants, and are thus sounded, they must be expressed by their
proper characters, as the rest of the consonants, whether it be in the
beginning, middle, or ending of words.

CHAP. VIII. Of the marks for the beginning and ending of long words.
ALthough by the former rules any word may be written in this Art, and there is
no necessity of learning more (the rest that follow, only serving to shorten
the former) yet to those that desire to be exact in this Art, the benefit of
the rules that follow will counte^vail the pains of learning them therefore (in
the next place) for the abbreviating of longer words, I have added characters
for the beginnings and endings of such as are most usual. Place here the table
of beginning and ending long words


These marks having little dependence upon the letters, are therefore to be
learned perfectly, being of much use in writing.

In the using of them the same rules are to be observed as before in words of
one syllable.

If a word begin with one of these marks, the character for it must be set
down; if a consonant come next, it must be joined to the mark, without taking
off the pen, and then write the letter or letters following in the room of the
vowell. As for example, to write condemn, first write your mark for con,
which is thus [^]; the next letter d being a consonant must be joined to con
thus [^] and then in the vowels place, which is e, write m disjoined thus [^]
Prepositions for long words.

^ itude ^ ing ^ ler ^ lent ^ litie ^ mer mar ^ meant ^ ness ^ ous ^ cent sent ^
serve ^ sion tion ^ soever ^ ternall ^ there ^ tent ^ ture ^ ver ^
To write prefer, your mark for pre is thus [^] join f thus [^], and in the
place of e write r dis-joyned thus [^]. To write submit, your mark for sub
write thus [^], join m to it thus [^] and in the place of i write t dis-joyned
thus [^]: as in these, fortune ^ rebel ^ contain ^ remit ^ proceed ^ translate
^
and the like.

If two of the marks make up a whole word, and no vowell come between them,
they are both to be joined together; as to write reference, write your mark for
re which is thus [^], and then join ference thus [^]. To write project set
down pro thus [^], and join the mark for ject thus [^]: as in these. former
^ perceive ^ circumference ^
and the like.

If you have a mark for the ending of a word, and not to begin it, you must
begin it with the letters of the Alphabet; as for example, to write nature,
write n thus [^], and then ture being a mark to end it, must be set in the
place of a thus [^]. To write brother, join br thus [^], and set the mark for
there in the place of o thus [^]: as in these; nation ^ never ^ pliable ^
difference ^
and the like.

If you have a mark to begin a word and no mark to end it, it must be ended
with the letters of the Alphabet: as to write permit, write the mark for per
thus [^], join m to it thus [^], and write t dis-joyned in the place of i thus
[^]. To write suffer, write your mark for suff thus [^], and then set r in the
place of e dis-joyned thus [^].

If a vowell come next after a mark or consonant to begin a word, the letter or
mark following the vowell must be set dis-joyned in the room of the vowell: as
in these, courage ^ support ^ potent ^ lament ^
and the like

CHAP. IX. Directions for making the foresaid marks, and placing the vowels in
long words.
IN making your Characters, begin them so that you take not off the pen unless
it be in those that cannot otherwise be made.

Secondly, the most of them are so framed, that you may end them toward the
right hand, that so with more convenience the next letter may be joined if it
be to be joined.

Thirdly, the next consonant or mark is to be joined where you last took off
the pen from the former.

The vowels in long words are to be placed about the last letter, if it be a
word that goes forward in the line; as to write contemn, write con thus [^],
join t thus [^], and then set m disjoined in the place of e against t thus
[^], not against con thus [^]. To write disdain, write dis thus [^], join d
thus [^], and then set n in the vowels place against d thus [^], not against
dis thus [^], etc.

Those marks for ending of words that begin with a vowell, are commonly to be
joined to the former mark or letter: as in these, durable ^ nation ^ bring ^
and such like.

Unless there come another Vowell before them, and then the mark is to be set
dis-joyned in the place of the former vowell: as in these, doing ^ pliable ^
pious ^
and such like.

The character for s after some letters in the end of words cannot conveniently
be joined; therefore in stead of it write a tittle behind the whole word: as
in these, sayings ^ servants ^ conserves ^ pirates ^


CHAP. X. Of characters that resemble others.
THe same character sometimes stands for two things: as for example, there is
the same for ture and Christ ^ tern^ll and which ^ mess and what ^
etc. which is no hinderance (but a help) in the learning this Art, considering
how easily they may be differenced. When any of these marks stand alone by
themselves, they are for whole words: when they are joined with other marks or
letters, they are but a part; as for example, this mark [^] when it is written
alone, stands for which; when it is joined with other letters, it is ternall,
a part of a word; and so of the rest: and by remembering the one, the other is
easily called to mind.

CHAP. XI. Whether marks for beginnings may be used to end words, and contrary.
THe marks for beginning of words may be used for endings, and then endings for
beginnings (when they be shorter than the letters of the Alphabet) without
inconvenience: as in these, mercy ^ former ^ assume ^ Messiah ^ sentence ^
consent ^ durable ^ endure ^
where you may observe, the mark for the beginning of the former word, is the
ending of the next.

CHAP. XII. Examples of words written with the marks, with marks for the names
of the books of the Bible.
THe greatest difficulty that some (who have only the help of the book) have
found in attaining this Art, is about the using the foresaid marks in the
writing of words; to help such, Examples of words written with each of the

long words.
composed of those marks, wherein for the most part there are two words with
each mark; the former having a consonant following the preposition, the latter
a vowell.

These words are not to be learned without book, (many of them being after
shorter expressed in the table) but are only examples to direct the learner
how to write otherwords by them.

I have also added in this Book, marks for the names of the books of the Old
and New Testament: the most of them are drawn from the letters, and therefore
the learning of them is little charge to the memory.

CHAP. XIII. Of writing 3. or 4. words in one.
AS I said Chap. 1.
before, sometimes three or four words or more, may be joined together as one
word, especially if the following word begin with a vowell: as in these. as it
is in use ^ this is of all other ^ which is as if it ^
Or else when the former word ends with a vowell: as in these, do so too ^ do
no more so ^ so he may die ^
and the like.

To make many marks for whole sentences is needless; because by the rules of
this Art, any thing may be written word for word, as fast as it shall be
treatably spoken.

And it is indeed impossible to use them exactly, because sometimes the speaker
varying a word or two in the sentence, the mark is either of no use, or else
the sentence must be rendered in other words then it was spoken, which is a
wrong to the speaker: therefore I have only abbreviated a few, which commonly
are spoken in the very words as I have set them down: as for example.

The Church of God ^ The people of God ^ The kingdom of God ^ The kingdom of
Christ ^ The kingdom of heaven ^ The kingdom of Satan ^ The joys of heaven ^
The torments of hell ^ That is to say ^ As if he should say ^ As if it were ^
The power of God ^ The truth of God ^ The mercy of God ^ The wisdom of God ^
The glory of God ^ The honor of God ^ The justice of God ^ The word of God ^
The works of God ^ The love of God ^ The fear of God ^
Many other like might be added, but these I think sufficient to direct the
discreet learner, who may add more if he see them ^^efull.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Table.
THough any word in any language may be written by the former rules, yet to omit
nothing that may tend to the speedy attaining of this Art, I have added a short
Table of words, so frequent in use, that almost in any ordinary sentence the
greater part of the words are written by this table, without removing the pen
from the paper in any one word.

The most part of these words are little charge to memory, being made out of
the letters of the Alphabet.

Those that think the abbreviat^ng long strange words by marks, to be an
help to this Art, are of another mind. I think it needless, for First, any
long word may be expressed by the former rules. Secondly, marks for words so
seldom in use are often times forgotten, before there be occasion to make use
of them, whereas many of these are written in every sentence. Thirdly, as such
words are longer in writing, so are they also in speaking. Lastly, in many long
words, some part may be omitted, and yet no hinderance to the reading of it, as
in Chap. 1.


In this book at the request of some (who have found it useful) I have drawn
the table into sense as near as I could, keeping to the Alphabeticall way,
that it might take the better impression in the memory of the learner. The
words that follow orderly in the table, are those that have the marks set
against them; the other words that stand forward in a smaller Character, are
added only to make sense of the other, and have marks also in their place.

Of the use of points in this Art.
ALthough to those that have attained any perfection in this Art, there is no
great use of pointing; yet for the help of new beginners, I have added this
direction:

At the end of a perfect sentence, the ordinary period may be used which is
this. But because it has some resemblance with another word, leave the space
of a word before and after it, thus. or else set it a letter lower than the
line, thus

The Interrogative point may be used in the common form, thus? Parenthesis
likewise as it is usually expressed with two semicircles, thus () For other
points of less use, as Comma, Colon: and the like, they may wholly be spared.

Those that desire to write the New Testament, or Bible, for the distinction of
Verses, at each Verse end they may set this mark
