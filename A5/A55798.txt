THE Witch of the Woodlands: OR, The Cobblers New Translation.
CHAP. I.
IN the Wild of Kent, not far from Rumney Marsh there dwelt a merry-conceited
Cobbler, commonly called Robin the Devil, which afterward came to be called,
The Witch of the Woodlands. This Cobbler always had a special care to please
his Customers, but chiefly he would be sure that if any pretty Wench brought
him a job to do, he would go through stitch with her work first of all; He
could jest and be merry in company; he could sing in his shop like a
Nightingale; he could cut a caper with Jack Pudding, and was not much inferior
to lusty Laurence, which got eighteen wenches with child all in one year, for
it was well known that he got three wenches with child all in one night; but
as the Proverb goes, The Pitcher that goes often to the water, may at last come
broken home: And the sweetest meat requires the sowrest sauce: So it fared with
Robin the Cobbler, for one of his wenches being suddenly brought to bed with a
male child, the Mother of the Damsel served Robin the Cobbler with a Warrant,
and made him to marry her daughter out of hand; then was the poor Cobbler
fallen into a pecke of troubles, and knew not how to behave himself: For
though he had been Factor for Mars, yet he never was made a Vulcan before that
time; And now must he provide for cloutes and whitles, fire and candle, soap
and starch, white bread and milk, a nurse and a cradle, with many other
matters which belongs to married men to look after; But as it is in the
Proverb, That one ill chance follows another, So was it with him for the
other two Damsels which he had formerly made use of, now began to make use of
him, and brought him two children more to keep, which was done both on one day;
which when Robin the Cobbler did behold, he fell into such a fearful quandarie,
so that the people that beheld him, said that he looked so pitifully upon the
matter, that they thought in their minds that he would never be good again.

Then began Robin with doleful words, with weeping eyes, and with wringing
hands to bewail his former follies, saying, O silly rogue that I am, was it
not enough for me to sing, dance, drink Ale, break Cakes, talk and be merry
amongst Maids? but that I must like a Towne-Bull, overrun all that stand in my
way, and so in the end he pounded for my breaking loose; now am I in a worse
case then Porrage John, Marret the Lawyer, or the Cow-keeper of the Pinder of
Wakefield; I would that my Father had never begot me, then should I never have
begotten so many wenches with child; or else I would that some honest
Sow-gelder had done his office upon me to Here Robin for his former Letchery,
Does suffer in his Members grievously.
man with knife preparing to use it on Robin the Cobbler's privates; bird of
prey in background keep me honest, then had I escaped the misery now I am sure
to endure: Now whilst Robin the Cobbler was making this sorrowful lamentation,
a friend of his whispered him in the ear, and gave him counsel to be gone
from them all, saying, That one pair of heels is worth two pair of hands;
whose counsel Robin took, as you shall hear in the following Chapter.

CHAP. II.
RObin the Cobbler having hearkened to his friends advice, made no more to do of
the matter, but trust up his Tools to be gone, resolving to come for London,
and there to work Iourney-worke till such time that his children were come to
be men, and able to work for themselves; but as he passed along the Country,
which is called the Wild of Kent, he lost his way in the Woodlands, when night
was almost come upon him, and finding no path to guide him, he wandered up and
down till it was almost ten of the clock in a pitiful cold frosty dark
Winters night: but at the last he heard a Cock crow, whereby he understood
that there was some dwelling house near at hand, and so being somewhat
comforted to hear the crowing of the Cock, he made his approach to the house,
and knocking at door, there came forth an old woman with a dish clout bound
about her head, and a staff in her hand, and demanded of Robin to know what
he knocked for; O Mother, quoth he, I am a poor distressed Traveller which
has lost my way, and willing would I be to give six pence for a Bed this night
to lay my weary bones on: Marry, quoth she, all the beds that I have are not
worth six pence, for I have no more then what I lie on my self, but if thou will take pains to do as I do, thou and I will lie together for once, where
we will hug one another as the Devil hugged the Witch: Robin beholding and
taking notice of her person all the body over, saw that she was long-nos'd,
bleare-ey'd, crooked-neckt, wry-mouthed, crumy-shoulder'd, beetle-brow'd,
thin-belly'd, bow-legg'd, and splay-footed: He began to frame an excuse,
saying, Good Mother, I pray you to consider this, that I am a Batchelour, and
never came in bed with any woman since I was borne of my Mother; Will thou
swear that that which thou speak is true: I will, quoth Robin, whereupon he
heard a hollow voice, as if it came out of the top of a Chimney, crying three
several times, Robin the Cobbler is mine, Robin the Cobbler is mine; Robin the
Cobbler is mine; These words when he heard, he thought that some she-devill was
come to fetch him away alive, and presently he fell into such a trembling
condition, that his hands shook, his pulses beat, his heart panted, his head
aked, his nose dropped, his belly rumbled, and a certain parcel of melting
tears dropped out of the lower ends of his breeches, and so falling down upon
his knees to the old woman, desired her to let him have a lodging, how she
would, or where she would; then the old woman took him in, and with a remnant
of water which she had kept a long time in a Chamber Pot for that purpose, she
washed him from the crown of the head to the sole of the feet, and made him as
white as if he had washed him in puppy-dog-water, and so they went lovingly to
bed together; what followed after shall be related in the ensuing discourse.

CHAP. III.
AFter that Robin the Cobbler had taken his first sleep, he awaked, and turning
himself on the other side, he sent for his Bedfellow, but she was not there;
and having gotten all the Bed-room to himself, he began to wonder with
himself about the passages which had happened to him the night before, and
therewithal he bethought himself how he might use a means to get away before
the old Witch his new-made Landlady came back again to him, for he supposed
that she had gone forth to fetch company to cut his throat; but whilst he was
thus thinking, in came the old woman with three more of her Disciples, with
every one of them a light Torch in her hand, crying out all at once, that they
would be revenged on Robin the Cobbler for all his Whore-hunting tricks: These
four female Witches could transform themselves into any humane shape at their
own pleasure; so she that Robin took to be his mother-in-law, brought in an
ugly Bear at her heels, another brought a ravening Wolf, and the third
brought a sharp long broad bladed knife; poor Robin, although the weather was
cold, and the Bed-clothes very thin, yet he was hot enough: for being in a
stinking fear, he covered himself over head and ears, all save one hole that
was in the cover-lid, which he now and then closely peept out at, but burst not
to stir for his life; but now begins the game, The grand Witch of the Company,
otherwise called the Landlady of the house, put her hand under the bed, and
pulled out a Taber and a Pipe, and played such a fit, that it lasted till it was
within two hours of day; all this while the other three Witches danced the
Irish Hay with their heels upwards, mean time poor Robin the Cobbler lay a
bed and bepist himself, till at last two quarts run through the bed upon the
ground, whether it were done for joy, or for fear, I Will leave that to other
such as himself to consider of; but when the Music was ended, the Bear
began to rore, and the Woolfe began to howl for food, then said the old Witch,
I have in the house the bravest breakfast for your two Familiars that they have
feasted on ever since they devoured the two damnable Whores which were bewitched
as they rode in a Coach toward a Bawdy House in London; and now since that
Witches have power of none but Swearers and Cursers, Thieves and dissemblers,
Pimps, Bawds and panders, whores and Whore-hunters, and such like manner of
people, let us make the best use of our time that we may: And now you shall see
what a gallant prize I have lighted upon by chance: There was a merry disposed
Cobbler, which dwelling not far from the Town of Rumney, who was every day used
to drink, swagger, swear and domineere, and oftentimes he would say that he
cared not a turd for all the Witches in the World, and that he had a trick to
defend himself from the power of Witches; which was by washing his hands, and
saying his Prayers every morning before he went forth of the doors; but
although he served God in the morning, he served the Devil ere night; for
there was hardly one day in the week, but he would go a whoring, and
oftentimes he would entice honest Wenches to sin by his dissembling speeches,
and his false forswearing himself, making them believe, that if he got them
with child, he would marry with them; amongst the rest, he got three Widows
daughters with child, all in one night, making every one of them believe, and
swearing that he would marry with them the morrow after, which he never did
intend, but at last Good-wife Webb the Widow forced him to marry her daughter;
which being done, the other two Wenches which he had gotten with child, being
delivered, brought him their two children to keep, so as he got them all three
with child in one night, so they brought him three children to keep in one
day; these things he thought that Witches had not known, but my Imps spent not
their time in vain, for I every night sent forth my familiar Imp Madge of
Wakefield, in the likeness of a black Cat, which told me of every thing that
Robin the Cobbler did do; but the archest piece of Roguerie that ever he did in
all his life, was done to a Widow woman in the Ille of Thanet, for he promised
her marriage, and made her sell her Widows Estate for four and twenty pound,
and told her, that if she would lend him the money to buy him Leather, that he
would be married to her on Thursday next, and wished, that if he did not do
according to his promise, that he might be torn in pieces with Woolves and
Bears, but he never came back to the Widow again; And last of all he run
away from his Wife and thee Children, and now he lies under that Coverlid: When
the other three Witches had heard this discovery, they all leapt for joy, and
the three familiar spirits which went in the shape of a Wolf, a Bear, and a
black Cat, were ready to tear the Witches to pieces for victuals, they were
so hungry; then said one of them to the rest, seeing he wished that he might
be devoured by Wolves and Bears, he shall have his wish, and he shall
presently be cut in quarters, and the Wolf shall have his Heart, Liver, and
Lungs for his breakfast, the Bear shall have his Paunch and Bowels, and the
Cat shall have his privy members to gnaw upon: Nay, quoth the older Witch, it
shall not be so, for he shall not have so pleasant a death as you speak of,
but we will have a little more sport with him before he dies: That very word
procured some comfort to Robins languishing spirits; for he had rather choose to
lead a sorrowful life, then to dye a sudden death: And now to be brief in the
matter, they pulled the Bed-clothes from off him, and made him stand up stark
naked as ever he was borne before them, the Wolf bit him by the throat, the
Bear bit him by the bum, and the Cat bit him by the members, and every one
drew blood of him, but did him no great harm at that time; Now, said the old
Witch, we have marked you for our own, and therewithal she past sentence upon
him, that he should have three days punishment for his former offenses, and
afterward he was to be eaten up alive; the first of the three days he was to
be transformed into the shape of a Fox, and to be chased with Dogs from morning
till night.

Here Robin the Cobbler like a Fox does run,
Before the Dogs, whose rage he cannot shun.
fox pursued by three dogs

The second day he was to be a riding Nag, and to carry the Witch whither she
pleased: The third day he was to be an Owl, and to fly from one place to
another all the day long; so having agreed upon the matter, as soon as the day
appeared, Robin the Cobbler was to be a fox, and so out of the doors they set
him a running, and having transformed themselves into the shape of dogs,
followed close at his heels, and every time they overtooke him, they bit him
by the buttockes, and nipt him most devillishly, for they had no mercy in their
teeth.

The next day they transformed him into the shape of a Horse, and so the
Witches got upon his back, three of them at a time, and rid him over hills and
mountains, through Rivers and Ponds, through all sorts of waters thick and
thin; and worst of all, they rid him through so many bushes, brambles, and
briars, til they tore the very skin from the flesh of him; so that the
Whoremasters blood of his run from him in many places; and yet were not his
sorrows at an end, nor no man knows when they will be.

The third day they made an Owl of him, who flying up and down from Tree to
Tree at noon time of the day, crying, whu, whu, whu, the birds came thick and
threefold about him, wondering most strangely to see an Owl abroad by
daylight; wherefore to fulfill the old Proverb, they all fell upon him like
Pyes upon an owl: And to be brief, they plucked his feathers, broke his wings,
and picked out one of his eyes: This being done, the grand Witch consulting with
the rest of the Witches, saying, That Robin the Cobbler had done enough of any
conscience for his wenching tricks, and so they turned him into the shape of a
Swan:

Here Robin by the virtue of a Swan,
Has broke the Witches charms, and is a man.
Robin the Cobbler astride a swan

And last of all they withdrew their Enchanting spells, and so Robin the
pitiful Cobbler became a man again; but before he departed, they made him to
kneel down, and kiss every one of their fleshy parts, and therewithal they
parted household.

CHAP. IV. How Robin the Cobbler having got loose from the Witches, became a new
man, and of many notable exploits which he did, you shall pleasantly hear.
NOw when Robin the Cobbler had broken the spells of witchcraft, his eyesight,
his hearing, his speech, his senses, and his knowledge, was all restored unto
him again, but yet he looked of a pitiful complexion, just as a man may say,
like one of Pharaoh's lean kine; his visage was pale and ghastly, his eyes
seemed as if they were sunk into his head, his nose was like the nose of a
scoulding Ale-wife, long and sharp, and his tongue did gaggle, as if it had
been made of the Devils bollock leather, his belly and his back were so clung
together, that he was scarce able to shit for bones.

Nor had he any kind of Habit to put on that was worth the throwing to the
dunghill, only an old lousy smock, and a pair of slip-shooes, which one of
the Witches had given him out of her mere pitiful charity; but yet he knew
himself to be in a far more happier taking then he was in before, when he was
riden with there she-devils at one time.

Then began Robin to ruminate, and to think what course he were best to take,
and which way was best for him to steer his helm, and at last he resolved to
take his journey once more for the famous City of London, and to try if fortune
would afford him any better luck then he had before; but he vowed that he
would keep along on the Road, and never go through the Woodlands any more, for
fear lest the Witches should meet with him again. Now as he passed along on
the way; in every Town and Village where he came, the boys and the Children
would run away from him, thinking that he had been mad, insomuch that there was
not one idle boy or girl to be seen in the streets, but here comes one, the
very bitterest of al, poor Robin the Cobbler, having gone along on his journey
for the space of almost two woeful days and nights, without bread or drink, or
money to buy, he began to bewail his sorrowful life; in this mournful
manner: Oh pitiful Cobbler that I am, for now I am in a worse case then ever I
was before. When I was a Horse, the Witches did ride me, and put me to much
pain, but yet they gave me somewhat to feed upon at night, though it were but
branne and water, which I can approve to be pretty good fare for horses when
they are very hungry, and so they may have enough to fill their bellies
withal. When I was a Fox, the Witches in the shapes of Dogs can after me, and
hurried me up and down, and at every stop and turn bit me by the buttocks;
but now am I hungerbitten, which is ten thousand times worse. When I was an
owl, I was most shamefully abused, and wondered at by other birds; but now am I
made a wondering stock to all the folks that sees me, insomuch that no man,
woman nor child, will not nor dare not come anear me, long of the poverty of
my flesh, and disguise of habit. Oh what a pitiful wretched case am I in now;
An Ape, an Owl, a Fox, a Goose, a Horse, an Ox or an Ass is in a far better
taking then I am in. O that I could with Diogenes Mare feed upon thistles, or
like a Camelion, live by the air. Now whilst he was thus complaining, by
chance came along a blind Beggar man, which had a whole Wallet full of
fragments of Fish and meat, and mammacks of Bread and Cheese, which he had
gotten amongst his good benefactors. When Robin the Cobbler had sirt his eyes
upon the blind man's Wallet of victuals, the very heart in his belly leapt for
joy, hoping that then he should fill his belly once again, and thereupon
taking courage upon him, he made his address, and spoke to the blind Beggar
man, by way of complement, knowing that the blind man could not see what manner
of person he was, and so taking hold of him by the shoulder, began to express
his mind in this manner: Well overtaken Father, how far walk you this way,
marry, quoth the Beggar, but to the next Village, and for want of a Guide to
lead me, I am in fear that I shall come too late to my lodging; why quoth the
Cobbler, rather then you shall do amiss, I will take the pains to lead you my
self, for I love old men with all my heart.

CHAP. V. Here follows a discourse of the happy fortune that happened to
Robin the Cobbler after all his miseries.
AS Robin the Cobbler was leading the blind Beggar along on the way, the blind
man found him to be exceeding diligent, and therewithal desired of Robin to
know who he was that would undervalue himself to take pains to lead him; Then
quoth Robin, I am a Gentleman borne and bred, and so you would say if you could
but see me; but as it comes to pass, I have never a penny to help my self,
for I have been a valiant Cavalier for the King, but by the fortune of the Wars
I am utterly undone for ever, unless some speedy help come by heavenly
Providence. I tell you Father, my Land not long since was sequestered, my goods
and my money taken from me, and my body carried to prison, where I have lain
three years, three months, three weeks, and three days, and at the last, by
happy chance I got out of prison; but now I am out I know not how to live, nor
how to get one bit of bread to relieve my hungry stomach, for I have been
fasting two days and nights, and never a bit of victuals came within my body:
Alas for you good Sir, said the Beggar, I much lament your case, but if you
will be pleased to accept of such poor fare as I have in my Wallet, you shall
be heartily welcome to it, and the next Alehouse that we come to I will give
you liquor of the best to man with knife preparing to use it on Robin the
Cobbler's privates; bird of prey in background swallow it down: whereupon the
Wallet was laid down, and the victuals sorted out upon the green bank. I
think there was no need to bid Robin to eat, but when he had filled his belly
away they went together cheerfully to the place appointed, where they lay
lovingly together that night, and the next day the Beggar brought him home to
his own house, where was plenty of good clothes, both of Woollen and Linen,
with which the Beggar suited Robin, and also directed him to a coffer where was
two hundred and fifty pounds of ready money; All this quoth the Beggar, shall
be your own when I dye, if you will stay with me all my life time.

Whereupon the Cobbler replied, with a very good will Sir; which bargain being
made, Robin and his old Master would every day walk about to good men's houses,
to see what victuals they could get, till at the last, Robin became as cunning
at the Trade as his Master, and was acquainted with most of the Master-Beggars
that lived in the County of Kent.

But to conclude, In process of time, the blind Beggar dyed, and then all his
wealth fell to Robin, who afterward went home to his former habitation, and
took order for the breeding up of the three children that he got in one night,
and gave the two wenches ten pounds apiece for the injury that he had formerly
done them, and threw the rest of the money into his Wives lap, and so ends
the story of Robin the Cobbler.
