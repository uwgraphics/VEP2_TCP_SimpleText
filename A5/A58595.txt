TO His Highness THE PRINCE OF ORANGE.
HAIL to Great ORANGE, hail Triumphant Prince,
Thou true Vicegerent of Omnipotence;
To thee, with all the Attributes of Heaven
Inspired, to thee Beloved, is only given
Avenging JUSTICE and the Power to Save,
Deliver, and Protect; And he that gave
Those Godlike parts, will, nay he must secure
The great Possessor, if Time be to endure,
For on your different Fate seems to depend,
The WORLDS long quiet, or its hastened End;
The True RELIGION also needs must fail
The Gates of Hell for ever must prevail,
If for the CHURCH your dearest Life be spilt,
You're now that ROCK on which that Church is built.
No Glorious PRINCE, the Almighty now has shown
Too signally, Your CAUSE to be His OWN;
(And you the Dearest FAVORITE of Heaven,
By the amazing Aids, his power has given)
For us to doubt; we'll gratefully endeavor,
To thank kind Heaven, then say PRINCE live for ever.
Long had the Famed BRITTANIA nobly strove,
To bear and hide repeated Wrongs with LOVE
And DUTY; thinking 'twould move a generous mind,
By fresh Engagements, not to be more unkind;
But all in vain, the more she gave, the more
She was Insulted on, though n'ere before,
Did She Affronts of half that moment bear:
At last by The Ungrateful she was forced to Tear
Her self away; an angry Scorn supplied
Her former Love; nor could she more abide,
But parting quick, I Will humble you, says she,
And make you^ know, you hold your power from me,
It Was I that raised you, and can pull you down,
The rest was seen through a Majestic frown.
Strait she an Embassage to HOLLAND sends,
And Council takes with her true Noble Friends;
Wherein she is advised to send her Mind
To that great PRINCE, after this moving kind:
Most Royal Sir, It Is not to You unknown,
What great Abuses we have with Patience born,
And hitherto had born, (for it is our Fate,
Long since to Feel th'Encroaching Tricks of State,)
But when I found my Great Foundations shook,
And Nothing less, could satisfy the stroke,
Of Petty undermining Vermin, who
Pretend Authority for what they do,
Though no Authority, but first takes date
From those Great LAWS they seek to Violate;
Those Ancient Laws, than which there is nothing can,
Be held more Sacred, nor stronger made by Man;
LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE the false Sirens Sing,
While Violence and Wrong far louder ring;
Closetting, Imprisoning, Deprivations,
Dispencing Power, and unjust Regulations,
With these, my Famous Liberty's betrayed,
Thus British Property a Prize is made;
A Foreign Force is Threatened, and perchance,
We Innocent, are basely Sold to France;
But which is worse, which is the greatest Blow,
We must Great PRINCE, thus plainly let you know,
(Having too just Suspicion for our fears)
You and Your Royal Consort's wronged; the Heirs
Of all our utmost Hopes, Desires, and Prayers;
Unnaturally are Wronged; come mighty PRINCE,
Regain your Right, punish their Insolence,
And be the Church and Nations great Defense;
We will assist You with our utmost power,
Command our Service from this very hour,
Our Army sends the same, though raised for ill,
Yet love their Faith and Dearest Country well:
Come to our Longing Shoars, O come away,
Heaven will assist, Destructive is Delay.
When to the Warlike Prince this Message came;
First having paused, thus answered to the same:
Illustrious Queen, I Am troubled when I hear
What You have suffered, and what more you fear;
A speedy Aid (pressed by so just a Cause)
My Near Relation, and my pity draws,
Dissipate your Grief, my self will shortly come,
Redress your Wrongs, or freely meet my doom.
The Careful Prince all other thoughts laid by,
The else impossible design, does ply
With luckiest Haste, unparalleled Secrecy;
Both were with such success pursued, that we
May almost fear, a Vision's all we see:
So strange, so sudden, that the Relation seems
T'out-do Romances, or Luxuriant Dreams;
The Seas, the Winds, the Season of the Year;
Fleets, Armies ruled by Providence, conspire
To finish the Triumphant Scene, to These
Add Conscious Flights, with timorous Guiltiness,
Infatuate Councels, Inexorable Wilfulness,
More than our hearts could wish, or thoughts could guess:
Deliverance and Protection's now the Themc,
Which Fame does through the Happy Land proclaim;
While grateful Hearts, shall thronging round you lie,
And Unborn Nations, bless your Memory.
Thou Greatest HERO of thy RACE, go on,
The like Success thy Vast Designs shall Crown;
This's but an Earnest of thy future Power,
Now ENGLANDS King, then EVROPES Emperor;
Europe to You, Your mighty Fortune grants,
Europe Deliverance and Protection wants;
Two Ore-grown Monsters, there you will suppress,
The Gallick Tyrant, and Roman Sorceress,
Who both Unite their Venom, and their Power,
The Innocent, REFORMED, to Devour:
You like APOLLO, shall Confound their Ends,
And from the Earth, drive the PYTHONIAN Fiends.
Were Homer then alive, he would blush to see,
His Famed Achilles, far surpassed by THEE:
That Matchless Artist, would with amazement view,
More than he feigned of him, performed by You.
Could we the Sycophantish Praises give,
Which Vainest Tyrants have been flattered with;
Could Rhetoric be like Minerals distilled,
And our weak Verse, with th'Volatile Spirit filled;
Could we Extract th'Sublimest Strains that e're
By Art in Panegyricks did appear,
They Would be like Torches lighted to the Sun,
Or Pygmy Guards around a Giants Throne:
Stop then thou Feeble Muse, nor farther dare,
Angels alone this Theme are fit to bear.
FINIS.
