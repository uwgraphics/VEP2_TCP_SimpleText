The Seaman's Compass:
OR A dainty new Ditty composed and pend,
The deeds of brave Seamen to praise and commend
It Was made by a Maid that to Gravesend did pass,
Now mark and you quickly shall hear how it was.

To the Tune of The Tyrant has stolen.




AS lately I traveled
toward Gravesend,
I heard a fair Damosel
a Seamman commend
And as in a Tilt-boat
we passed along,
In praise of brave Seamen
she sung this new Song:
Come Tradesmen or Merchant,
whoever he be
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me.
A Seaman in promise
is faithful and just,
(...) in carriage
(...) true to his trust:
Kind in behavior
and constant in love,
Is firm in affection
as the Turtle Dove,
Valiant in action
in every degree
There Is none, etc.
The Seaman adventures
their lives at the Seas
Whilst Land-men on shore
takes pleasure and ease,
The Seaman at all times
their business must ply
In Winter and Summer
in wet and in dry,
From toil and pains-taking
they seldom are free,
There Is a one, etc.
Moreover i would have you
for to understand
That Seamen brings treasure
and profit to Land
Above and beneath ground
so we^lth they have sought
And when they have found it
to England it is brought
With hazard of lives
by experience we see
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me.
Seamen from beyond Seas
bring Silver and Gold
With Pearls and rich jewels,
most rare to behold
With Silks and rich Velvets
their credits to save,
Or else you gay Ladies
could not go so brave
This makes my heart merry
as merry may be
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me.
The Seamen bring Spices,
and sugar so fine
Which serve the brave gallants,
to drink with their wine
With Lemmons and Oranges
all of the best,
To relish their pallats
when ehey make a Feast,
Sweet Figs Prunes and Raysins
by them brought home be
There Is none, etc.
To comfort poor people
The Seamen do strive
And brings in maintenance
to keep them alive
As row silk and Cotton wool
to Card and to spin
And so by their labors
their livings comes in:
Most men are beholding
to Seamen we see
With none but a Seaman
I married will be,
The Mercer's beholding
we know well enough
For Holland, Lawn, Cambrick,
and other gay stuff
That Is brought from beyond-seas
by Seamen so bold
The rarest that ever
men's eyes did behold,
God prosper the Seamen
where ever they be
There Is none etc.
The Merchants themselves
are beholding ^lso
To honest Sea men
that on purpose do go
To bring them ho^e profit
from other strange Lands
Or else their fine daughters
must work with their hands,
The Nobles and Gentry
in every degree
Are also beholding etc.
Thus for Rich and poor men
the Seamen does good
And sometimes comes off with
loss of much blood:
If they were not a guard
and a defense for our Land
Our Enemies soon will get
the upper hand.
And then in a woeful case
straight should we be
There Is none etc.
To draw to Conclusion
and so make an end
I hope that great Neptune
my Love will befriend
And send him home safely
with health and with life,
Then shall I with joyfulness
soon be his wife
You Maids, Wives and Widows
that Sea-mens Loves be
With hearts and with voices
join prayers with me.
God bless all brave Seamen
from Quicksands and Rocks
From loss of their blood
and from Enemies Knocks
From Lightning and Thunder
and tempests so strong
From Ship rack and drowning
and all other wrong
And they that to these words
will not say Amen
It Is pity that they should ever
speak word again.
