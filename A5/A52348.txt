The Nightingales Song, Or, the Soldiers Rare music, And maids Recreation.
This Song advises Maidens to have a care,
And of Soldiers Snap^s^cks to beware.
The Tuneis, No, no, no, not I; Or, Pegg and the Soldier.




AS I went forth,
one Sun-shining day,
A dainty young couple
were gathering May:
The one a fair Damosel,
of beauty most clear,
The other a Soldier,
as it both appear.
With kisses and complements,
to her he said,
G^^-m^^row sweet Honey,
thou well-favour'd Maid,
I think my self happy,
I met with you here,
As you are a Virgin,
and I a Soldier.
And now if you pleased be,
I will you bring,
Whereas you shall hear,
the sweet Nightingale sin^
With other late pastimes,
my s^^ll shall be tried,
^
Sweet sir said the Damosel)
if you will do so,
Then hand in hand with you,
along I will go;
It is Recreation,
for Maids in the Spring,
To see Flowers grow,
and hear Nightingals si^g.
And having thus spoken,
together they went
Unto a merry green-wood
where some time they spent;
I ^ walking and talking
of many a^odd thing
But yet could not hear,
the Nightingale sing;

(...) The Maid seemed unwilling,
and said she would be gone,
And yet she was-^oath
for to leave him alone,
At lost she resolved,
her self to this thing,
To stay till they heard,
the sweet Nightingale sing.
Amongst the sweet Flowers,
they straight way sat down,
The young man in kindness,
gave her a green gewn:
He also presented
to her a Gold Ring,
Cause she should stay there,
till the sweet Nightingale sing.

THen now said the soldier,
it is time to give over,
Nay prithee (woth she) play
me one (...) more:
I like (...) the setting,
and tuning the string,
Far better then hearing,
the Nightingale sing.
He struck up his Music
unto a high strain,
And played the Tune over,
again and again:
Gramercy brave Soldier,
quoth she, that didst-bring,
Me hither, to hear the rare
Nightingale sing.
Their sport being ended,
then homeward they went,
Each one thought the time,
to be very well spent:
It was (quoth the Damosel)
a very rare thing,
Whil^t thou plaid'st thy part,
to hear the Nightingale sing.
At last with a deep sigh,
(...) ^se words seake she,
(...) Soldier,
(...) Else my hassy pleasure,
sweet sorrows will bring,
And I may repent I heard,
the Nightingale sing.
Oh no, quoth the Soldier,
I may not do so,
Along with my Captain,
to morrow I must go:
But if I come this way,
again the next Spring,
We Will walk once more to hear,
the Nightingale sing.
You Maids of the City;
and Country, that be,
Addicted to pleasure,
take warning by me,
Let no slattering Young Men,
tempt y^ to this thing,
To go to the wood to hear,
the Nightingale sing.
Make bargaia beforehand,
for fear you miscarry,
Know whether or no they are
minded to Marry:
If I had been wise, and
had done such (...)
