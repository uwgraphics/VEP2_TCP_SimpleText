By G. M.

LONDON Printed by H.C. for Jonathan Robinson, at the Golden Lion in St. Paul's
Churchyard, 1691.

To the Most Honorable THOMAS, Marquess of CAERMARTHEN, Earl of DANBY,
Viscount LATIMER, Baron OSBORN OF KIVETON, Lord President of His Majesty's Most
Honorable PRIVY COUNCIL, And Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter,
This New State of England is humbly Dedicated by the Author.

TO THE READER.
IT IS the late Revolution that has given birth to this new Piece of Work; a New
Face of Things required a New State of England. And of all the Changes this
Kingdom has gone through, as this was the most sudden, so it is the most
wonderful. To see Popery in so few days crowing upon the Throne and groaning
under its Ruins, but the other day upon the Pinnacle and now stunned with its
sudden Fall, is such a Change as may deserve the Admiration of this and future
Ages. In short, such is our present Settlement, upon Their Majesty's happy
Accession to the Crown, that the Popish Party may as soon see a Protestant Pope
of Rome as a Popish King of England.

Now, to make this Work the more acceptable and useful to the Public, I have
divided it into three several Parts. In the First you have a particular
Description of ENGLAND in its several Counties; of every County-Town, with the
Distance, and the common Road to it, from London the Metropolis; and of all
other Places of note in each County. Here you have particularly a List of the
Market Towns in every Shire, with the Days pointed when their Markets are kept;
also, an account of most other Remarkable Things, either of Nature or Art.
Besides the Honors, or Noblemens Titles, from Counties, Cities, Towns,
Manors, etc. And the Number of Men each City, or Borough, sends to serve in
Parliament. I conclude this Part with a particular Description of London,
Oxford, and Camidge. London as the Capital City of England, the Seat of its
Monarchs, and the Center of Trade. Oxford and Cambridge, as being the two
famous Universities of the Land, and the glorious Seats of the Muses.

The Second Part treats of the INHABITANTS of England; their Complexion,
Temper, Genius, Language, etc. Of the English Way of Living, Commerce, Laws,
Religion, and Government. Of the King of England, and the Royal Family;
particularly of the present King WILLIAM and Queen MARY, with a brief Relation
of their Accession to the Crown, and the Unreasonableness of the Disaffected
Party under their Government. Of Their Majesty's Court, Forces, and Revenues.
Of the Queen Dowager, the Prince, and the Princess of Denmark. Of the Nobility,
Gentry, and Commonalty. Of the Episcopal, Dignified, and Inferior Clergy. And
lastly of Women, Children, and Servants. All of them with their respective
Privileges.

The Third and last Part is about the COURTS of JUDICATURE. Viz. The High Court
of Parliament, with a large Account of their Proceedings, Orders, Debates,
Passing of Bills and Acts, etc. Of the Privy Council, and there particularly of
the Principal Secretaries of State. Of the Chancery, King's Bench, Common Pleas,
Exchequer, Duchy of Lancaster, and all other Courts. To which is annexed a
Catalogue of the chief Persons of the Realm both in Church and State,
Magistrates, and Officers Civil and Military. Who being subject to Change,
though the Offices continue the same, I thought it improper to mix Certainties
and Uncertainties together. Therefore I chose rather to place the Officers
together by themselves, as I have done here, than to have them dispersed where
I speak of their Offices. And from this Method you will reap this Convenience,
that, by Interleaving of the Catalogue only, you may fill up Vacancies as they
become void.

Thus you have (as it were) a Scheme of the whole Drift of this Book. The
Foundation whereof is that Ingenious Piece De Republica Anglorum, written in
Latin by Sir Thomas Smith, Improved as you see, and fitted to the present
Times. The Matter of it self, is of a general Use both for English and
Foreiners; and the Variety so great, that it cannot but be Pleasant and Useful
to the Reader.

THE TABLE For the First PART.
This Table contains the Names of the Towns and Cities, Hills, Islands, Meers,
and Rivers, and other Curiosities mentioned in the first Part of this Book. And
for such as desire only to know what County any of them lies in, the Table it
self will give them that Satisfaction, without any further Trouble; it being so
contrived, that it is in a manner a Geographical Dictionary for England.

THE FIRST PART OF THE New State OF ENGLAND Under Their MAJESTY'S K. William
and Q. Mary.

CONTAINING A Geographical Description of England in General, and of every
County in Particular, with Useful and Curious Remarks.

London, Printed in the Year 1691.

THE NEW STATE OF ENGLAND. PART I.
CHAP. I.
Treating of ENGLAND in general, and of every County in particular.

England
ENGLAND is the best and largest Part of the greatest Island of Europe. An
Island anciently called Albion, from its white chalky Cliffs; but since better
known by the Name of Great Britain. Great, for the vast Extent of ^t, reaching
(as it does) in Length, from North to South, about 600 Miles. Britain, that is,
a Country Inhabited by Painted Men, as formerly they were wont to be.

At this time it is principally divided into three Parts, England, Scotland, and
Wales; the first two being two distinct Kingdoms, the last a Principality, but
all of them happily united under one Head.

ENGLAND takes up the South Parts of the Island, being parted from Scotland
Northward by the River Tweede; from Wales Westward, in part by the River Dee;
and from the rest of the World, by the Ocean. Thus it contains in Length, from
North to South, as from Barwick to Portsmouth, 320 miles; and in breadth, from
East to West, as from Dover to the Lands End, 270.

But such is the Variety of its Breadth, that in the South Parts, which face
the Channel, it is three times the Breadth of the North. And all along the
Seacoast in general there are so many Creeks and Inlets, some greater and some
lesser, that England (and indeed the whole Island) delineated as it is in
Globes and Maps, makes but an odd kind of Figure. However in this Spot of
Ground, not exceeding one third Part of France, there are reckoned 30 millions
of Acres.

In reference to the Globe, it lies between the 50, and 57 Degree of North
Latitude; the longest Day in the most Northern Parts being 17 hours, 30
minutes; and the shortest in the most Southern, almost eight hours long.

The name of ENGLAND it took from the Angles, an ancient People of Jutland in
Denmark; who, joining with their Neighbors the Saxons, went under their Name
in the Conquest of Britain. And this Name was given it by a special Edict of
Egbert, the first sole Monarch of England, since the Heptarchy. Who, being
descended from those Angles, and having reduced the whole Country from a
divided State into one entire Body, called it (with the Concurrence of the
States of the Realm, then convened at Winchester, Anno 819.) by the Name of
Engle-lond, since turned into ENGLAND. From whence the Nation and Language came
to be called English.

When the Romans were possessed of this Country, they made but two Parts of it,
and another of Wales. Called Britannia Prima, Containing the South of England.
Britannia Secunda, Containing Wales. Maxima Caesariensis, Containing the North
of England.


Their particular Divisions were not of the Country it self, but of the
Inhabitants. As the Atrebatii, Belgae, Brigantes, Catieuchlani, and ten Nations
more they reckoned only in England.

In the time of the Anglo-Saxons, England alone was divided into seven
Kingdoms, Viz. The Kingdom of Kent, Containing the County of that Name. The
Kingdom of South Saxons, Containing Sussex, and Surrey. The Kingdom of
West Saxons, Containing Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Barkshire,
and Hampshire. The Kingdom of East Saxons, Containing Middlesex, Essex, and
part of Hartfordshire The Kingdom of East Angles, Containing Norfolk, Suffolk,
Cambridgshire. The Kingdom of Mercia, Containing Gloucester, Worcester,
Hereford, Shropshire, Cheshire, Stafford, Darby, Nottingham, Leicester,
Rutland, Lincoln, Huntington, Northampton, Warwick, Salop, Oxon, Buckingham,
Bedford, and the rest of Hartfordshire. The Kingdom of Northumberland
Containing York, Lancashire, Durham, Westmorland, Cumberland, Northumberland,
and the South Parts of Scotland as far as Edinburg.


But England's Division into Shires or Counties did not begin till the Reign of
Alfred, about 800 Years ago. Afterward every Shin was subdivided into
Hundreds, and Hundred into Tythings; a Hundred containing te^ Tythings, and a
Tything ten Families.

The Shires, or Counties are either Maritime, or Inland; in all 40 in number.

The Maritime Counties, I mean such as be watered by the Ocean, are these. Viz.
Cornwall. Devonshire. Somersetshire. Dorsetshire. Hampshire. Sussex. Kent.
Essex. Suffolk. Norfolk. Lincolnshire. Yorkshire. Durham. Northumberland.
Cumberland. Westmorland. Lancashire. Cheshire.


Whereof the first seven Counties take up the most Southern Parts, and lie all
along the Channel, which parts England from France; the next seven run from
Kent and Sussex Northward, bounded on the East by the German Ocean; and the
last four^ly North-West, bounded by the Irish Seas.

The Inland Counties are Nottinghamshire. Derbyshire. Staffordshire,
Shropshire. Worcestershire. Herefordshire. Monmouthshire. Glocestershire.
Wiltshire. Barkshire. Buckinghamshire. Surrey. Middlesex. Hartfordshire.
Cambridgeshire. Huntingtonshire. Bedfordshire. Oxfordshire. Warwickshire.
Northamptonshire. Rutland. Leicestershire.


Amongst all which Counties, it is Observable, that some of them take their
Names from the old Inhabitants; as Cumberland from the Cyntbri or ancient
Britains; Essex and Sussex from the East and South Saxons, who settled here
after their Conquest. Some from their Situation, as Northumberland, Norfolk,
Suffolk, and Middlesex. To which add Kent (in Latin Cantium,) because it lies
in a Canton, or Corner of the Island.

Others, from their Form, or Figure; as Cornwall, from the figure of a Horn,
called Kere by the old Britains. And indeed this County, growing from East to
West smaller and smaller, is not unlike a Horn; besides that, in many places it
shoots forth into the Sea with little Promontories, like unto so many Horns.
Whereas Devonshire took its Denomination from the British Devinam, signifying
low Valleys, of which this County does very much consist.

Others again, from some Accidents therein As Barkshire, from Beroc, a certain
place wherein grew good store of Box; Rutland, q. d. Red Land, from the Redness
of its Soil.

But the most part from the principal Town of the County; as Glocestershire
from Gloucester, Oxfordshire from Oxford, Cambridgeshire from Cambridge, etc.

As of all the Counties of England, Yorkshire is the biggest, beyond all
compare, so i^ Rutland the least. Out of the first, which i^ counted as big as
the Seven United Provinces 70000 Men may be raised for present Service. Whereas
the Extent of the last is so inconsiderable, that one may skip it over in les^
than half a day.

In point of Situation, Darbyshire may b^ looked upon as the middle Province of
the Kingdom.

Besides the former Division of England into Counties, there is a common way of
dividing it but into Two Parts, North and South, that is, all the Counties on
the North and South Side of the River Trent. Which way is followed by the
Justices in Air of the Forest, and likewise by the Kings at Arms.

Another Division there is, relating to the public Administration of Justice
by the Itinerant of Judges. And that is into Six Circuits, of which I shall
give a particular Account in my second Part.

Lastly, for the Church Government, England is divided, first into two
Provinces, or Archbishopricks, namely Canterbury and York; and these two
Provinces into 22 Diocesses, or Bishoprics; these into Archdeaconries,
Archdeaconries into Rural Deanries, and these last into Parishes. The Number
whereof (setting aside the 12 Counties of Wales,) amounts to near Ten Thousand.

CHAP. II.
The Advantages of ENGLAND from its Situation, in opposition to Inland
Countries. The natural Beauty of it. A Description of its principal Rivers.

OF all the States of Europe, there is none more happy than ENGLAND, whether we
consider the Advantages of its Situation, the Temperateness of its Air, the
Richness of its Soil, the happy temper of its Inhabitants, or the Blessed
Constitution of its Government, especially under their present Majesty's.

As it is in a manner surrounded by the Sea, it injoys Two great Advantages,
the One in Relation to foreign Trade, and the Other in point of Security from
foreign Invasion.

In relation to foreign Trade, it lies open to all Parts of the World that are
adjacent to the Sea, either for the Exportation of homebred, or the Importation
of foreign Commodities. To which purpose, as Nature has fenced its Seacoasts
from the Irruptions and Inundations of the Sea with high Cliffs, so she has
furnished it with abundance of safe and capacious Harbors for the security of
Ships.

As for a foreign Invasion, it is certain, that Islands of any great Importance,
are by Nature the most defensible Places, and the least open to Conquests. The
Sea, that fluid Element which surrounds them, is such a Bar to their Enemies
Attempts; the Winds that govern it, so fickle and uncertain; the Charges of a
Fleet and Land Army so vast; the Preparations such as cannot be carried on with
that speed and secrecy as for an Invasion by Land; and the Difficulty of
Landing so great, in case of Opposition.

It Is true no Continent perhaps was oftener Conquered than ENGLAND, first by
the Romans, then by the Saxons, afterward by the Danes, and last of all by the
Normans. But how was it done? always by the help of some discontented, or
corrupted Party in the Island. Thus Bericus, a noble (but disgusted) Britain,
encouraged Claudius the Roman Emperor, to stretch his Empire hither. And
Vortiger an Usurper of the British Throne, called in the Saxons to his help;
who, having got a footing here, could not be so easily expelled as brought in.
In short, it may be said, England was never, and can scarce be Conquered but by
England; especially since its happy Conjunction with Scotland, and the Annexion
of Wales. As to the late Revolution, it is self evident, that the chief Part of
the Nation had a hand in it; and as it proved, we may justly call it, not an
Invasion, (as King James affected to do,) but a wonderful and signal
Deliverance.

To those Two great Advantages of Trade and Security, which England does enjoy
from its Situation near the Sea, let us add the Prospect it has from the
Seacoast of the wonderful Ocean, one of the three great Antiquities of the
World; and the plentiful Variety of Fish, and Sea-Fowl, etc. it affords to this
Island.

But that which raises my Admiration of ENGLAND, is the Beauty of it, being
generally a flat and open Country, not overgrown with wild and unwholsom
Forests, nor dreadful high Mountains. What Hills it has are generally very
gentle and pleasant, and raised as it were to give a charming Prospect to the
Eye; as its Forests seem only contrived for Variety, and the pleasure of
Hunting.

But one Thing there is, which adds much to the Beauty of it, and that is its
excellent Verdure. Which by reason of the mildness of the Air, even in the
Winter-Season, exceeds in duration of Time the most fruitful Places of Europe.

To which add the Concourse of so many Rivers, which glide through this
Country, and strive to make it agreeable and fruitful.

They are reckoned in all 325, the chief whereof are these following. Viz. The
Thames. The Medway. The Severn. The Ouse. The Trent. The Humber. The Tees. The
Tine. The Twede.


The Thames is a Compound of the Them and Isis, two Rivers, the first whereof
rises in Buckinghamshire, the other near Cirencester in Glocestershire, both
joining together into one Stream by Dorcester in Oxfordshire, where it parts
that County from Barkshire. From whence taking its course Eastward, with many
Windings and Turnings, it parts Buckinghamshire from Barkshire, Middlesex from
Surrey, and Essex from Kent. Where being swelled with the Influx of several
lesser Rivers, it discharges it self into the Sea; watering by the way, amongst
other Towns, Reading and Windsor in Barkshire, Kingston and Southwark in
Surrey, London in Middlesex, Barking in Essex, and Gravesend in Kent. A River
the Water whereof is extraordinary wholesome, the Stream exceeding gentle, and
the Tides very commodious for Navigation. For the Sea flows gently up this
River about 80 Miles, almost as far as Kingston, being 12 Miles by Land, and 20
by Water, above London.

The Medway is a Kentish River, not so remarkable for the length of its Course,
as for the Depth of its Channel; and therefore made use of for harboring the
Royal Navy. It runs thorough Maidstone, Rochester and Chatham, a few Miles from
whence it empties it self in the Mouth of the Thames. This River loses it self
under Ground, and rises again at Loose, not far from Cox-Heath.

The Severn rises in Montgomeryshire, a County of North Wales. From whence it
runs through Shropshire, Worcestershire, and Glocestershire, where it does so
expatiate it self, that the Mouth of it is more like an Arm of the Sea, than
any part of a River. It waters in its course Shrewsbury, Worcester and
Gloucester, the chief Towns of the foresaid three Counties; and takes in by the
way several Rivers of good note, two Avons, the Temd, the Wye, and the Vsk.

The Ouse has its source in the South-Borders of Northamptonshire. From whence
it runs through the Counties of Bucks, Bedford, Huntington, Cambridge, and
Norfolk, where it discharges it self into the Ocean; watering in its Course
Buckingham, Bedford, Huntington, Ely, and the Seaport of Lyn in Norfolk. The
River that runs through York, has also the Name of Ouse, being a Compound
chiefly of these three Yorkshire Rivers, the Swale, the Your, and the Warfe.
And between Norfolk and Suffolk you will find the little Ouse, which parting
these Two Counties, runs at last into the great Ouse.

The Trent, which divides England into Two Parts, North and South, has its Rise
in Staffordshire; and from thence runs through Darbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and
Lincolnshire, where it falls into the Humber not far from Hull. It waters in
its course these three chief Places, Nottingham, Newark, and Gainsborough.

The Humber is a Yorkshire River, if that can be called a distinct River which
has no Spring of its own, but is more properly a Compound (or rather a Mouth)
of several Rivers joining into one Stream, especially the Trent, and the York
Ouse, the Dun, and the Darewent. The Town of Hull is seated upon it, before
which Place it widens it self (much like the Severn at its Mouth) to a great
breadth, and so falls into the Sea.

The Tees is another River of the North, parting Yorkshire from the Bishopric
of Durham, and running from West to East into the Sea.

The Tine, famous for its Coal-trade, parts for some Miles Durham from
Northumberland, running likewise from West to East Seaward, by Newcastle,
therefore called Newcastle upon Tine.

The Twede is the furthest River Northward, and that which parts England from
Scotland. At the Influx whereof into the Sea is seated Barwick, called from
this River Barwick upon Twede.

But, besides these principal Rivers, and many others of less note, though
several of them Navigable, I cannot but mention those pleasant Rivulets and
Brooks which are so numerous in this Country. Whose clear and swift-running
Streams add much to the Beauty and Fruitfulness of it.

CHAP. III.
Of the Air of ENGLAND. Its Temperateness, and the Effects of it.

BY the Situation of ENGLAND, so far North as it is, one would think the Air
should be pretty sharp here, and at least colder than in France, which lies
South from it. Whereas it is so Temperate, Winter and Summer, that the Winters
are milder here, and the Summers much more moderate.

In Wintertime the warm Vapors of the Sea on every side do so thicken the
Air, that it cannot so soon penetrate as the thin Air of hot Countries. In
Summer the frequent Interposition of Clouds, often dissolving into Rain, and
the usual Blasts from the Sea, allay those excessive Heats, which both hot and
cold Climates are troubled with in that Season, for want of Wind and Rain.

Thus ENGLAND has the happiness of being seldom tired, either with a long Frost
in Winter, or Drought in Summer. On the contrary, while Continents in the same
Latitude, and some of a much more Southern Situation, ly under Snow, pinched
with a hard Frost, it happens often that our Fields are here clothed with
Grass, as in the Spring. And whilst the Sun in Summer scorches the Plants, and
the Inhabitants themselves of hot Climates, here it shines so kindly, that it
does but warm us by a moderate Heat, which makes the Country so plentiful both
of Corn and Pasture.

It Is true, on the other side, the Air is nothing so pure, nor the Weather so
serene, or regular, as it is in Continents. Most part of the Winter ENGLAND is
under a Cloud, often stuffed up with Fogs, troubled with rainy Weather, and
(except there happens a Frost) but seldom enjoying the Sun in its splendor.
Whence proceed those frequent Colds, which are in a manner the original Cause
of most of our Distempers; and from the frequency of Rain, Land-floods, which
drown the Countries where the Rivers swell out of their Channels, and break
over their Banks.

And yet, as rainy as this Country is, we seldom see here such impetuous
Showers (or rather Storms) of Rain, as hot Countries are subject to, which
often drown the fairest Hopes of the Husbandman. For, if they have Rain but
seldom, they have it by the great, and sometimes with a Vengeance. Whereas in
England, where it is more frequent, it proves most commonly a gentle soaking
Rain.

But there is another Inconveniency in the Weather here, and that is its
Changeableness, and Irregularity, according to the Wind that blows. Which
happens sometimes to be so frequent and sudden, that in the space of 24 hours I
have observed four different sorts of Weather, proper enough for the four
Seasons of the Year. This I confess, is an extraordinary Case. But however such
is the Mutableness of the Weather, that it seldom holds out many Days in the
same degree, either of Warmth, Coldness, or Dryness. And of all Times of the
Year, the Month of March is the most subject to Change, witness the usual
Expression, March Many-weather.

And yet this may be said for Changeableness of Weather, that it creates
Diversion by its Variety. What is more comfortable in Winter than a warm Day
after a fit of cold Weather; and a cool Day in Summer, after a fit of hot
Weather? The quickest and most refined Pleasures grow dull by their
Continuance, but Change sets an edge upon 'em. And, as glorious as the Sun
appears in its greatest splendor, I have oftentimes been weary of its
undiscontinued Appearance for a long time together.

On the other side ENGLAND is nothing near so subject to Hail, to Thunder, and
Lightning, or to the Heavens darting of Thunderbolts, as many other Regions,
which are frequently alarmed with those dreadful Meteors.

And, if Nature be somewhat too prodigal of Moisture in this Country, she is on
the other side as careful to cure it. Scarce a fit of Rain is over, but comes a
fit of Wind to dry up the Moisture, and purify the Air. So that the most part
of the Year is commonly divided betwixt these two Gods of the Heathens, Jupiter
and Aeolus.

The Wind that reigns most in ENGLAND is the Westerly Wind, which blows from
the vast Western Ocean perhaps three parts in four of the Year. But when I say
a Westerly Wind, I don't mean only that which blows directly from the Cardinal
Point, but all the Collateral Points from South to North.

An Easterly Wind, especially in the Spring, is looked upon here to be fatal to
Plants; and if the Proverb be true, to Man and Beast.

For high Winds, and tempestuous Weather, we have here two Times of the Year,
seldom free from it. And those are the two Equinoxes, in September and March.
But for Hurricanes, and Earthquakes, England of all the Countries in Europe, is
the least subject to 'em. The Storm indeed which happened on the 12th of January
last, was so very violent, blew with such impetuous Gusts, and proved so
mischievous, that it may pass for an Hurricane. But it was such as the like has
not been known here within the Memory of Man.

In short, whatever be the Disadvantages of ENGLAND in point of Air, in respect
to other Countries, the same is sufficiently countervailed by the Sweetness and
Comforts of it, as 'twill further appear by the ensuing Chapter.

CHAP. IV.
Of the Products of ENGLAND, both from the Land and Water, and the Fruitfulness
thereof.

IT IS said of Henry the Seventh, one of the wisest Kings that ever sat upon the
Throne of England, but whose Breeding had been low and private, That, being
once pressed by some of his Council to pursue his Title to France, he returned
this Answer; It Is true, says he, France is a noble and gallant Kingdom, but
England in my mind is as fine a Seat for a Country Gentleman as any is in
Europe.

I pass by the Reflection; and taking his Answer in a plain literal Sense, I
own, that England is, in most Things, one of the finest and best Countries in
Europe. I have already demonstrated wherein its Beauty consists, and now the
Subject of this Chapter shall be its Plentifulness.

And first for Corn, either for Man or Beast, it may cerainly outvy most
Countries in Europe; As it may for Pasture, which makes the Cattle thrive here
exceedingly. And, though here be many Heaths, yet they are not so barren, but
that they afford wherewithal to feed a World of Sheep.

Thus ENGLAND yields, not only Plenty of Corn, to make Bread and Drink with,
etc. but also abundance of all manner of Cattle, for wholesome substantial Food;
with plenty of Salt, Cheese, and Butter. For Dainties and Variety, it is stocked
with Fallow Deer, beyond any part of Europe. Hares and Conies, tame and wild
Fowl, eatable Roots and Herbs, Fruits of most sorts it has abundance of. And so
constant is the Continuance of these Things in England, by reason of the
Clemency of the Air, that it has not felt a Famine for several Ages.

The Sea and Rivers, on the other side, furnish it with plenty of all manner of
Fish, as Herrings, Mackerels, Whitings, Pilchards, Soles, Plaices, Flounders,
Cods, Salmons, Sturgeons, Lampreys, Congers, Turbots, Thornbaeks, Lohsters, and
Oysters, etc. these last being famous, among the old Romans, for their
extraordinary goodness. Here is also abundance of Carps. Pikes, Perches,
Trouts, Gudgeons, Tenches, Roaches, Daces, Breams, Eeles, Cray-fish, etc.

Spices we have, as all the rest of Europe, from the East and West Indies; and
from this last, that enchanting Commodity which has got so much the vogue here,
I mean Tobacco. Not but that the English Soil can bear it plentifully, as has
been found by Experience; but, because it is more proper, for several Reasons
of State, to fetch it at that distance.

In short, what other Things ENGLAND wants, whether for delight or fancy, are
easily supplied by Sea from those Countries where they grow; which either
exchange 'em for Money, or such Commodities of our Growth as we can spare, and
they stand in need of.

As for Wine, it is said indeed the South Parts of ENGLAND, as Kent and
Hampshire amongst others, have had formerly great Numbers of Vineyards, and (as
the Summe^ proved) made of them tolerable Wine. But since better Wine could be
had from o^^ Neighbors at an easier rate, the Vineyard were laid aside, and
the Soil turned to bette^ account. And yet, when the Season does answer to the
singular Care and Industry of the Husbandman, I may say this without Prejudice,
and from my own Experience, that England then affords in some Places as good
and delicious Grapes as most Parts of France. The same I may aver of some other
Fruits, as Peache^ amongst others; but then I must confess, Ar^ has a great
hand in it.

Lastly, The want of Wine is otherwise supplied by Beer and Ale, the usual
Drinks of the Country. Which, rightly made, is as wholesome a Liquour, though
not so cheerful, a^ Wine.

Now for Raiment, English Wool is famous all over the World, both for its
fineness and goodness. But that of Cotswold in Glocestershire, of Lemster in
Herefordshire, and of the Isle of Wight, has the pre-eminency. Of this Wool are
made excellent broad Cloths, dispersed not only all over England, but all over
the World, especially high Germany, Poland, Moscovy, Turkey, and Persia, to the
great benefit of this Kingdom. For the advancing of which Manufacture, that
necessary Earth, called Fullers-Earth, is no where else produced in that
abundance and excellency as in England.

For Flax and Hemp, to make Linen of, here is a great deal of good and proper
Soil; which I wonder should not be improved for that purpose, rather than have
so much Linen imported as there is from beyond Sea. But, as for Leather,
here is great Plenty of it, and such as is excellent for all manner of Use. And,
as England does swarm with Conies, their Furs go a great way for the making of
Hats.

Silks also might be here produced, as it was once designed by King James the
first.

For other necessary Conveniences, as for building of Houses, ENGLAND wants not
Materials, except such Timber as comes from Norway. For Firing, here is indeed
in most Places a Scarcity of Wood; but that Defect is abundantly supplied by
the Coal-Mines.

For Shipping, no where better Oak. For Land-Carriage, Plenty of good stout
Horses. For Hunting, or Racing, such as are incomparable. And for Beauty or
Fineness, scarce any Country like this.

Dogs of all sorts, sizes, and uses are also to be found here. Amongst which
the Mastiffs, whether Bear or Bull-dogs, are extraordinary, the first for their
Size, and both for their Stoutness. Our Spaniels also, and all sorts of Hounds
for Hunting, are of great request beyond Sea.

For Smell and Ornament, here all sorts of Flowers, even those that come from
the remotest Countries, thrive to admiration. But no Region perhaps abounds
like this in Laurel and Rosemary, two remarkable Plants for their perpetual
Greenness.

For Physical Uses, it scarce wants any Simple. Here grows plenty of excellent
Saffron and Licorish; neither does it want Honey or Wax, of the best fort. Here
are also hot Baths, and abundance of Medicinal Springs.

I come now to those inexhaustible Treasures of Coals, Lead, Copper, Tin, and
Iron, which are dug out of the Bowels of the Earth in this Kingdom. The
Coal-mines do chiefly enrich Newcastle in Northumberland, from whence a great
part of the Kingdom is supplied with Coals for Fuel; without which it could
not possibly subsist, so great is the Decay of Woods, and the Neglect of
planting.

The Lead-Mines are most considerable in the Peak of Derbyshire; and those of
Tin in Cornwall, where they dig Tin not much inferior to Silver in fineness.
Here are also Copper-Mines, but herein Cumberland does exceed it. As for the
Mines of Iron, it is true they bring more Damage to the Public by the Spoil of
Woods, than the Profit that accrues thereby to private Persons amounts to.

Here are also Silver-Mines, as in Cornwall, Lancashire, and the Bishopric of
Durham, richer than the very Mines of Potosi, in the West Indies, whence the
King of Spain has most of his Silver. For, whereas these yield usually but one
Ounce and a half of Silver in one hundred Ounces of Oar, our English Mines
commonly yield six or eight Ounces per Cent. It Is true ours lying deeper, and
harder to come unto, and the Workmen being dear (which is otherwise in Potosi,)
all these things concurring together, are like to secure them from any further
Attempt.

In short, though some Countries excel ENGLAND in some Things, yet this may be
said of it in general; That there is scarce any Country, whose Fields are
better stored with all sort of Corn; the Pastures, with Cattle; the Woods, and
Forests, Parks, and Warrens, with wild Beasts, only for Recreation and Food;
the Air with Birds and Fowls; the Seas and Rivers, with Fishes; and the Mines
with Coals and Metals.

On the other side, there is scarce a Country so little troubled with hurtful
and ravenous Beasts, with venomous Serpents, or noisome Flies and Vermin.

Wolves, which of all ravenous Beasts are the most pernicious and destructive
of Cattle, have been so wonderfully extirpated out of this Land, that I cannot
omit the History of it. I know it has been a Tradition of old Writers, that
England never had any Wolves at all, and that being brought hither from other
Places, they would not live. But History tells us the contrary, here being
abundance of them, till King Edgar commuted for 300 Wolves the yearly Tribute
paid him by the Prince of Wales. Which made the Welsh so industrious and active
in Wolf-hunting, that the Wolves were in time quite rooted out of the Land, the
Welsh protesting at last, they could find no more of 'em.

Whereby it is come to pass, that whereas in other Countries they are at the
Charge and Trouble of guarding their Sheep, and housing them by night, here
they are left feeding in the Fields day and night, secure from any Danger,
unless it be sometimes from Men-Wolves, or Sheep-stealers.

And yet I am credibly informed, that in some Places, as Warwickshire among the
rest, some Wolves from time to time have been discovered. But, as it happens
but seldom, so upon the least notice the Country rises amain, as it were
against a common Enemy; there being such a hue and cry after the Wolf, that it
is hard for him to escape the Posse Comitatus.

CHAP. V.
Of the COUNTRY in particular. And first of Barkshire, Bedfordshire,
Buckinghamshire, in the Alphabetick Order; With an Account of what is most
remarkable in each.

Barkshire.
BARKSHIRE, BERKSHIRE, or BERKS, is an Inland County. It Is bounded on the North
by the Thames and Isis, which part it from Oxfordshire; On the South, by
Hampshire; Eastward, by Surrey; and Westward, by Wiltshire and Glocestershire.

It contains in Length from East to West, about 45 Miles; in Breadth from North
to South, 25. The whole divided into 20 Hundreds, wherein 140 Parishes, and 12
Market Towns.

The Country is very pleasant, the Air sweet, and the Soil fruitful.

Next to the Isis and the Thames, which water the North Parts of it, the Kennet
is the principal River, which runs into the Thames at Reading, and yields
excellent Trouts, especially about Hungerford.

Reading the County-Town lies 32 Miles West from London, thus; viz. to
Colebrook, 15 from thence to Maidenhead, 7 and 10 more to Reading. A Town
commodiously seated at the fall of the Kennet into the Thames, over which
Rivers it has several Bridges, and that over the Kennet is the fairest. The
Town is well inhabited, and contains 3 Parish Churches. Of great Resort and
Trade, especially for its Cloth and Malt here made. Here the County Assizes are
usually kept; and its Market is on Saturday.

The other Market Towns are Windsor, Sat. Vantage, Sat. Abington, Mund. and
Frid. Faringdon, Tues. Ockingham, Tues. Wallingford, Tues. and Frid.
Maidenhead, Wed. Hungerford, Wed. East-Isley, Wed. Newbury, Thurs. Lainborn, --


Amongst which Wallingford and Abington, are two Towns of great Antiquity, and
such as have flourished in their time, but since gone to decay. The first being
the Guallena of the Ancients, and then the chief Town of the Attrebatii, was
afterward also among the West Saxons the chief Town of this County. A Mile in
compass at that time within the Walls, fortified with a strong Castle, and
adorned with 12 Parish Churches. But in the Year 1348, so desolated by a
Plague, that there is now but one Church left, hardly Inhabitants enough to
keep that in repair; and nothing of the Walls left (as not much of the Castle)
but the Tract and Ruins of 'em. However as it is seated upon the Thames (over
which it has a Bridge,) it makes shift to support it self by its Trade of
Maulting, and its Commodiousness for Transporting Corn and other Commodities to
London. And so does Abington, which lies North-West from it, at the fall of the
Ouse into the Isis. Noted for giving the Title of an Earldom to the Right
Honorable James Bertie, the present Earl of Abington, Baron Norreys, etc.

Windsor, on the Thames is chiefly remarkable for its Castle, the finest Royal
Palace of England, and the only Castle of six this County has formerly had,
which is now remaining. Which being seated on a great Eminence, with a stately
and spacious Terrass before it, injoys a pure Air, and a delicate Prospect.
Famous for being the Place where the Ceremony of the Knights of the Garter is
solemnized on St. George's Day.

Newbury and Hungerford are both seated on the River Kennet, few Miles distant
from each other. The first, of chief note for the Batte^ fought here in the
long Civil Wars, called Newbury Fight, where King Charles I. remained
victorious. And the last for having the best Trouts and Craw-Fish in all
England.

This County, formerly a Part of the ancient Kingdom of the West Saxons, (the
Inhabitants whereof called Attrebatii by the ancient Romans,) is in the Diocese
of Salisbury. Dignified with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the
Right Honorable Thomas Howard, the present Earl of Barkshire, Viscount
Andover, etc. Devolved to him from his Brother Charles, and to Charles from
their Father Thomas Howard, created Earl of Barkshire, Anno 1625. Which Title
had been enjoyed before him by another Family, but in the Person only of
Francis Norris, created Earl of Barkshire, by King James I. Anno 1620; who died
few Years after, without Issue Male.

Out of this County are chosen, besides the two Knights of the Shire, seven
Members to sit in Parliament. Viz. 2 from Reading, 2 from Windsor, 2 more from
Wallingford, and 1 from Abington.

Bedfordshire.
BEDFORDSHIRE, another Inland County is bounded Eastward by Hartfordshire, and
part of Cambridgeshire; Westward, by Buckinghamshire; Northward, by Northampton
and Huntington Shires; Southward, by Middlesex, and the South Parts of
Buckinghamshire.

It contains in Length from North to South not above 24 Miles; in Breadth, but
12; and in Circumference 72. The Whole divided into nine Hundreds, wherein 116
Parishes, and 10 Market Towns.

Here the Air is very temperate, the Country for the most part Champion, and
the Soil ferile, especially the North part of it. Noted, shiefly for yielding
the best Barley in Eng^and.

Next to the River Ouse, which waters the North Parts of it, the Ivel is the
chief, which falls into the Ouse.

A memorable Thing is recorded of this River Ouse, which I am unwilling to
pretermit. At a Place near Harwood, on New Years Day 1399, just before the War
began between the Two Houses of York and Lancaster, this River suddenly stood
still, and ceased its Course; and so severed it self, that Men went about 3
Miles together on foot in the bottom of the Channel, the Waters swelling up
backwards, to a great height.

Bedford, the County-Town, lies North-west and by North, 40 Miles from London,
thus. From London to Barnet, 10; 10 more to St. Albans, 8 from thence to Luton,
5 more to Baru^ Clay, thence to Bedford 7.

A Town pleasantly seated on the Banks o^ the River Ouse, that parts it into
two, and over which there is a fair Stone Bridge, Called Bedford from the Beds
and Lodgings on the Ford, built on both sides of the River for the use of
Travelers. A Town which in proces^ of time is grown to that bigness, as to
contain in it 5 Parish Churches, whereof 3 on the North and 2 on the South Side
of the River.

Famous in former times for the great Battle fought in the adjoining Fields
Anno 572 in which Cuthwolf the Saxon vanquished the Britains, and became Master
of the Country But more famous for giving the Title of Duke to John of
Lancaster, Regent of France for Kin^ Henry VI, and to Jasper of Hatfield, Uncle
(...) Henry VII. After whom it was dignified b^ King Edward VI, Anno 1548, with
the Title o^ an Earldom, in the Person of the then Lon^ Admiral John Russel;
and from him descende^ in a right line to the truly Noble and right Honorable
William Russel, the present Earl of Bedford, and Knight of the Order of the
Garter.

Lastly, this Town has two Markets a Week, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, well
furnished with all sorts of Provisions.

The other Market Towns are Tuddington, Sat. Potton, Sat. Luton, Mund.
Leighton, Tue. Biglesworth Tue. Dunstable, Wedn. Ampthill, Thur. Woburn, Frid.
Shefford, Frid.


Among which Dunstable, the chief of all, is seated on a Hill, in a chalky dry
Ground. Built by King Henry I. out of the Ruins of the ancient Magiovinium, for
the better suppressing of one Dun, a notorious Robber, that used to pester
these Parts, from whom it came to be called Dunstable. It has 4 Streets in it,
and in each of 'em a Pond, fed only with Rain, and yet these Ponds are never
dry. No Springs here to be found, without digging a very great depth. But as it
is seated in the high Road from London to West-Chester (formerly known by the
Name of Watling-street,) it is a well frequented Town, and accommodated with
several good Inns for Travelers. In this Town King Edward I. caused a Cross or
Column to be erected, adorned with Statues, and the Arms of England, etc. in
Memorial of Eleanor his Queen, this being the Place where her Corpse rested in
her Journey from Lincolnshire, where she died, to Westminster Abbey, where she
was interred. About this Town are caught abundance of Larks, which are esteemed
the best in England and where they are the best dressed.

Leighton is seated in the Borders of Buckinghamshire, upon a River that runs
Northward into the Ouse. This is a good large Town, having a Bridge over the
River, which leads to Buckinghamshire. And its Market is very considerable,
especially for all sorts of fa^^ Cattle.

Luton, a pretty good Town, borders upon both the Counties of Hartford and
Bucking ham; and Potton, upon Cambridgeshire. Woburn, on a rising Ground, is
much frequented by Passengers in their Journeys from London to Northampton.
Formerly of some account for its fine Monastery, as it is at present for its
Free School, founded by Francis Earl of Bedford.

Near this Town is Aspley, where the nature of the Soil is such, that it
petrifies Wood. An^ about this Town is dug up excellent Fulle^^ Earth in
great plenty.

Biglesworth is pleasantly seated on the Ive^ over which it has a Stone Bridge.
This Town formerly but inconsiderable, is grown into request, since it became a
Thorough-fare for Coaches especially, between London and York.

Shefford is situate on the other side of the ^vel, West and by South from
Biglesworth, between two Rivulets which join below the Town, and fall together
in one stream into the Ivel.

Ampthill, 5 Miles South of Bedford, is a^ Honor belonging to the Crown.
Graced with a fine Seat and Park in its Neighborhood, be longing to the Earl
of Alesbury.

To conclude, this County (formerly was Part of the ancient Kingdom of Mercia,
and its Inhabitants part of the Catieuchlani, as the Romans called them) is now
in the Diocese of London.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members
to sit in Parliament, the Right of Election being in the Town of Bedford.

Buckinghamshire.
Buckinghamshire, or Bucks, another Inland County, is bounded on the East by
Bedford and Hartford Shires, and part of Middlesex; on the West, by
Oxfordshire; Northward, by Northamptonshire; and Southward, by Barkshire.

It contains in Length, from North to South, about 40 Miles; in Breadth, from
East to West, 18. The Whole divided into eight Hundreds, wherein 185 Parishes,
and 15 Market Towns.

A Country blessed with a very temperate and healthful Air, and with a rich and
fertile Soil, yielding Grass and Corn in great abundance, especially the Vale,
lying Northwards. South-Eastward it rises into Hills, called the Chiltern,
which afford a great deal of Wood.

An infinite Number of Sheep is bred, especially in the Vales of this Country,
whose Fleece is much esteemed for its fineness.

As for Rivers, here is Northward the Ouse, and a small Stream that runs into
it; about the middle of the County, the Tame; and in the South-East Parts the
Coln, which severs part of this County from that of Middlesex.

Buckingham, the chief Place of it, lies Northwest and by West 44 Miles from
London. Viz. 6 to Acton, 9 more to Vxbridge, 9 more to Amersham, to Wendover 6
more, thence 4 to Ailesbury, and 10 more to Buckingham.

A goodly Town seated in a fruitful Soil, on the Banks of the River Ouse,
rising not far from it, and over which it has 3 fair Stone Bridges. It Is pretty
well frequented and inhabited; and its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, well
served with Provisions. In times past, it was fortified by King Edward the
elder. The Town Hall stands in the North Part of the Town; and the Chapel,
founded by Tho. Becket, is now converted into a Free School.

Otherwise not much observable but for those many noble Personages which have
had the Title of Earls and Dukes thereof.

The last Duke was George Villiers, who died in the late Reign. He was Son to
George Viscount Villiers, Baron of Whaddon; first created Earl of Buckingham by
King James the First, and afterward Duke thereof, Anno 1623. He was Lord
Admiral of England, and High Chamberlain; and was slain by Felton.

The other Market Towns are Newport, Sat. Ailesbury, Sat. Risborough, Sat.
Marlow, Sat. Oulney, Mund. Agmundesham, Tues. Colebrook, Wed. Chesham, Wed.
Winslow, Thur. Wendover, Thur. Beaconfield, Thur. Stony-Stratford, Frid.
Ivingo, Frid. High Wickham, Frid.


Amongst which, Newport, Stoney-Stratford, and Oulney, are all three seated on
the Ouse; Ailesbury, on the Tame; Marlow, near the Thames and Colebrook, on the
Coln.

Newport, or Newport Pagnel, a goodly Town, has two Bridges over the Ouse, and
is of chief note for the Bone-lace here made.

Stony Stratford, a Place of great Antiquity, being the Lactodurum of the
Romans, is a good large Town, containing two Parish Churches. And, as it lies
in the Way from London to the North-West Parts of England, it is well
accommodated with Inns for Travelers. This is the Way called Wailing-street,
being a Military Highway of the Romans, which crossed all the Country. At this
Place King Edward the Elder obstructed the Passage of the Danes, whilst he
fortified Towcester against them. And here King Edward Lerected a beautiful
Cross, in Memorial of his Queen Eleanor, whose Corpse rested here in her Journey
from Lincolnshire where she died, to Westminster Abbey, the Place of her
Sepulture.

Wickham, situate in a low and fertile Vale, on a small River which falls into
the Thames, is a Town which for largeness and fair Buildings is not inferior
to any in the County. Here the County Assizes are commonly kept, and sometimes
at Ailesbury.

Ailesbury stands in a most fruitful Vale, on the rising of a little Hill,
compassed about with many very pleasant green Meadows and Pastures. The Vale in
great repute for grazing of Cattle, and feeding innumerable Flocks of Sheep,
whose fine Fleeces are in great esteem. A Vale famous of old for S. Edith, who
bid^ling the World Adieu betook her self to this Vale, where she lived a pious
and holy life. The Town more remarkable of late for the Title of an Earldom it
gives to the Right Honorable Thomas Bruce, the present Earl of Ailesbury, and
Earl of Elgin in Scotland. Derived to him from his Father Robert Bruce, Baron
of Kinlos, Earl of Elgin, and Lord Whorlton in Yorkshire. Who was created by
King Charles II. Baron of Skeleton, Viscount Bruce of Ampthill, and Earl of
Ailesbury, March 18th. 1664. Advanced afterward to the Place of Lord
Chamberlain of his Majesty's Household soon after the late Kings Accession to
the Crown, upon the Decease of his Predecessor the Earl of Arlington.

Beaconfield is seated on a dry Hill, not far either from Wickham or Amersham.
A goodly Town, which being on the high Road from London to Oxford is very well
accommodated with Inns.

Marlow is probably so called from the great store of Marl or Chalk here dug
up; which adds no small advantage to the Husbandmen, who enrich their Grounds
with it.

But, besides all these Market Towns, here is Eaton upon the Thames, opposite to
Windsor, which deserves a Place here, for its fine College, and famous School
of Literature, founded by that Pious Prince, King Henry the Sixth.

Lastly, this County (which formerly was Part of the ancient Kingdom of the
West Saxons, and its Inhabitants part of the Catieuchlani, as the Romans called
them) is now in the Diocese of London.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 12 Members of
Parliament; viz. two out of each of these Towns, Buckingham, Ailesbury,
Chipping-Wickomb, Agmundesham, Wendover, and Marlow.

CHAP. VI.
Of Cambridge, Cheshire, and Cornwall.

Cambridgeshire.
CAMBRIDGESHIRE, another Inland County, has for its Bounds Eastward, both
Suffolk and Norfolk; Westward, Northampton, Huntington, and Bedford shires;
Northward, Lincolnshire; Scuthward, Essex, and Hartfordshire.

It extends it self in Length, from North to South, 35 miles; in Breadth, from
East to West, 20. The Whole divided into 17 Hundreds, 163 Parishes, and 8
Market Towns.

It Is for the most part a pleasant, fruitful, Champain Country, abounding in
all Things necessary, stored with Meadows and Pastures, plentiful of Corn and
Barley, and abundantly furnished with Fish and Fowl. The Northern Parts indeed
are Fenny, and therefore less fruitful of Corn.

But that Defect is sufficiently supplied another way, I mean by that plenty of
Cattle, Fish, and Fowl that are bred in those Fens. It Is true the Air, in those
Parts, is something the worse for them.

One Thing this County may boast of, besides Essex; viz. the Saffron it yields
in great plenty, which is the dearest Commodity that England produces.

The Herb called Scordium, or Water Germander (of which the Cordial Dioscordium
is made) grows here also very plentifully.

About 2 miles South-Eastward from Cambridge is a Ridge of Hills, called
Hog-magog Hills, retaining yet the remembrance of the Danish Station, and
whereof the Country people tell fine fabulous Stories. On the top of these
Hills is seen a Rampire, so strengthened formerly with a threefold Trench, that
the Place was counted to be in a manner Impregnable.

As for Rivers, here is the Ouse, which runs through the midst of it from West
to East, and then bending its Course to the North, parts this County from
Norfolk, till it discharges it self at Lyn into the Sea. The South Parts are
watered with two lesser Streams, the one called Came, and the other Grant, both
which join together into one Stream near Cambridge, under the first Name, and
so run together Northward into the Ouse. The North Parts indeed are too much
watered by the frequent Overflowings of the Ouse, and other Streams, that have
turned most of those Parts into Marshes.

I should now fall to the Description of Cambridge, but that it is a Place of
that Consequence as to deserve a particular Description by it self. For which I
refer you, together with that of Oxford, to the Conclusion of this Part. And so
I proceed to a View of the other Places of chief note in this County, which are
Market Towns, besides Cambridge.

The other Market Towns are, Ely Sat. Wisbich Sat. Newmarket Tue. Caxton Tue.
Royston, Wedn. Linton, Thu. Merche, Frid.


Among which Ely is situate in an Isle of that name, occasioned by the divided
streams of the Ouse and other lesser Rivers, turning a great part of this Tract
into Fens and Marshes. A Place of no great beauty or reputation, being seated
in a foggy and unhealthful Air; but only for being a Bishops See, and a County
Palatine, since the ^eign of Henry I.

Newmarket is partly in this County, and partly in Suffolk. It stands in such a
plain, that it has a Prospect three quarters of the Compass, almost to the
Bounds of the Horizon; the South-East Parts being more rising Ground, and
ending in Woodland. A famous Plain both for Hunting and Horse-races, where the
Kings of England use yearly to divertise themselves for some Days before
Winter. To which purpose there is a House built, on Cambridge side, for their
Reception. The Town it self is composed of a well built Street; and being a
great Thorough-fare, the Townsmen live chiefly upon Passengers; besides the
Advantage of the Court, when the King goes thither. It consists of two
Parishes, one in Suffolk, the other in Cambridgeshire. Its Market is well
served, particularly with Fish and wild Fowl from the fenny Parts, as it is
with Pigeons from the Fiekling. The Women here employ themselves very much in
spinning of white Work. And, not far from this Town, is the huge Ditch, called
the Devil's Ditch.

Royston stands in the bottom of a Hill, partly in this County, and partly in
Hartfordshire. Whose Market is very considerable, for Malt especially.

Lastly, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the
East Angles, and its Inhabitants part of the Iceni, as the Romans called them)
is now in the Diocese of Ely.

Out of it are elected, besides the 2 Knights of the Shire, 4 Members of
Parliament; viz. 2 by the Town of Cambridge, and 2 more by the University.

Cheshire.
CHESHIRE, a Maritime County in the North-West Parts of England, is bounded on
the East by Derbyshire and Staffordshire; on the West, partly by the Irish Sea,
partly by Flintshire and Denbighshire, two Counties of Wales; Northward, by
Lancashire; Southward, part by Denbighshire, and part by Shropshire and
Staffordshire.

It contains in Length, from East to West, about 45 Miles; in Breadth, from
North to South, 25. The Whole divieled into 7 Hundreds, 85 Parishes, and 13
Market Towns.

As flat as this Country is, yet it is not without several noted Hills, besides
the Mountains which divide it from Darby and Stafford Shires. It has also
several Woods and Forests, as namely Delamere and Maclesfield Forests; and is
so well stored with Parks, that almost every Gentleman has one peculiar to
himself.

Heaths and Mosses are frequent here; but the first serve to feed Sheep, and
Horses, and Mosses to make Turves of for Fuel.

As for Rivers, this Country is well watered with them; the South-west Parts,
with the Dee; the middle, with the Weever; and the North Parts, with the
Mersey, which divides this County from Lancashire. The Dee affords great plenty
of Salmon. And it is observable of this River, that upon the fall of much Rain,
it rises but little; but, if the South Wind beat long upon it, it swells and
overflows the Grounds adjoining. Here are ^lso many Meres, and Pools, in all
which are a^undance of excellent Fish.

Here the Air for Temperature, and the Soil for Fertility, is inferior to
none, and far ex^eeding the Neighboring Counties.

Its chief Commodities are Corn, Cattle, Sheep, Fish, Fowl, Salt, and Cheese,
the best ^n all England.

Chester, (otherwife called West-Chester, by reason of its Western Situation)
is the chief Place of this County, bearing from London North-West, and distant
therefrom (by common Computation) 150 Miles, thus. Viz. from London to St.
Albans, 20. from thence to Stony-Stratford, 24; to Daventry, 16 more; from
Daventry to Coventry, 22; thence to Lichfield, ^o more; to Stone 18; to
Nantwich, 15; and to Chester, 15 more.

This City was raised from the Fort Ostorius, Lieutenant of Britain for the
Emperor Clau^ius. And it is pleasantly seated on the River Dee, about 25 miles
from its fall into the Sea, the River widening it self all the way to a great
breadth. But the Channel is so choakt up with Sand for some Miles, that all
Ships now ^ome to a Place called the New Key, about 6 miles distance.

Over the River it has a fair Stone Bridge ^uilt upon 8 Arches, with a Gate at
each and, from whence issue the Walls of the City ^n a quadrangular form, high
and strongly ^uilt. In this Wall are 4 Gates, viz. the Eastgate, Bridge-gate,
Watergate, and North-Gate; the first being esteemed one of ^he stateliest
Gates in England. Besides these ^our principal Gates, there are three others of
^ess note, called the Posterns, and on the Wall are 7 Watch-towers, and broad
Battlements for Pieces of Ordnance. On the South side, is a stately strong
Castle, built in a circular form, with a Courtyard about it enclosed with a
Wall. In the North Part is the Cathedral adjoining to which is the Bishops
Palace.

In short, this City is beautified with diverse fair Buildings, both public and
private; and graced with large and well-ordered Streets* which are supplied
with fresh Water, by Conduit Pipes, from a Tower at the Bridge calle^
Water-Tower, 35 yards high, and 8 broad Along the chief Streets are Galleries
(or Row^ as they call them) with Shops on one side through which Galleries one
may walk fre^ from Wet in the greatest Showers.

As to the Number of Parishes in it, I fin^ no less than ten; so well
frequented this Pla^^ is by Gentry and Tradesmen. For, besides the Assizes held
here twice a Year, Chester being a County Palatine has also its Courts Palatine
kept here. And, as it stands commodiously for Ireland, with which it has a
great Intercourse, so it is a constant Thorough-far^ for that Kingdom.

Of late it has been of particular Note, for being the Rendezvous of great part
of ou^ Forces, that have been transported for the Reduction of Ireland; and
Highlake, on the North-side of the River's Mouth, for being the proper Place
for Shipping.

'Twas in this City of Chester that King Edga^ had his Barge rowed (by way of
Homage) b^ seven Kings of the Scots and Britains, from (...) John's Church to
his Palace, himself as s^preme Lord holding the Helm. And it is observable,
that the eldest Sons of the Kings (...) England (whether it be by birth, or
death (...) their elder Brothers, are ipso facto Earls of Chester.

The other Market Towns are Nantwich Sat. Middlewich Sat. Congleton Sat.
Knutsford Sat. Malpas Mund. Maxfield Mund. Altrincham, Tue. Fordsham, Wedn.
Sanbich, Thu. Northwich Frid. Stopford Frid. Tarvin Frid.


Amongst which, Nantwich and Fordsham are feated on the Banks of the Weever;
Stopford, on the Mersey; Northwich and Congleton, on the Dane, which runs into
the Weeve; Middlewich on the Croke, near its fall into the Dane; Maxfield, or
Maclesfield, on the Bollin; Sandbich, on the Welock.

Nantwich, Middlewich, and Northwich, are of chief note for their Salt Pits;
but the first especially, which (next to Chester) is the greatest and the
fairest built Town in the County. Here is the best white Salt made, and great
plenty of it.

At Congleton, they make great store of Points, Purses, and leather Gloves.
Sandbich is only famous for its Ale, sold at London for 12 pence the bottle;
which, for strength and clearness, does equalize Canary. Maxfield, or
Maclesfield, is a large and fair Town, which drives a great Trade of Buttons.
But it is of most note for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable
Charles Gerard, Earl of Maclesfield, etc.

This County (formerly a Part of the ancient Kingdom of Mercia, and its
Inhabitants part of the Cornavii, as the Romans called them) is now in the
Diocese of Chester.

The Earls hereof were anciently accounted Palatines; since William the
Conqueror gave this Earldom to Hugh Lupus, a noble Norman, to be holden as
freely by his Sword, as the King himself held England by his Crown; which was
the Tenure of all Counts Palatine, more like Princes than Subjects. And, though
it be now, (and has long been) reannexed to the Crown; yet it still holds the
Rights and Privileges of a County Palatine; having, for the administration
thereof, a Chamberlain, a Justice for the Common Pleas of the Crown, two Barons
of the Exchequer, a Sheriff, an Escheator, and other Officers, to the great
ease of all the Country, in expedition of their Business.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members
of Parliament, and Chester only has the Right of Election.

CORNWALL, the furthest County in the West of England, is on all sides
surrounded with the Sea; except Eastward, where the River Tamer parts it from
Devonshire.

Its Length from East to West is about 70. miles; and the broadest Part, next
to Devonshire, 40. The Whole divided into nine Hundreds, wherein 161 Parishes,
and 21 Market Towns.

The Country being for the most part but narrow, you cannot expect here Rivers
of any long Course. The Tamer aforesaid is the most considerable; next to which
you have the Camel, and the Fale.

Here the Air is pure and subtle, but much subject to Winds and stormy
Weather; and more apt to preserve than to recover Health, especially to
Strangers.

The Spring is something backward here, which makes the Harvest to be later
than in the Eastern Parts; but, on the other side, the Winter does prove milder.

The Country in general is hilly, and rocky, the Rocks being crusted over with
a shallow Earth. The Parts toward the Sea are the most fruitful both in Corn
and Pasturage. Which happens partly by the industrious manuring the Ground with
a fruitful sort of Sand, and a Sea-weed called Orewood. The middle Parts,
except the Enclosures about Towns and Villages, ly generally waste and open,
and serve chiefly for Summer Cattle. But, as to Game, both for the Hawk and the
Hound, here is great store of it.

One Thing it excels all other Counties in, and that is its Tin Mines, the Tin
whereof goes beyond any in Europe for fineness.

Here is also found in some Rocks a sort of precious Stone, called the Cornish
Diamond, shaped and polished by Nature; and some of them as big as a Walnut,
but indeed not so hard as the right Diamond.

For Fishing of Pilchards, this is the Place; the Time, from July to November.
When the Sea does so swarm of them, that enough can be spared to supply France,
Spain, and Italy with them in great Stores; the smoaked one being called
Fumados in Italy, where they pass for a great Dainty.

In Mounts Bay is the famous Hill, called S. Michael's Mount, severed from the
main Land by a sandy Plain, which at Ebb-water may be passed over on foot. A
Hill that proudly raises it self to a great eminence, the top of it being a
small Plain, the greatest part on it taken up by an old Fort.

Nigh unto the said Bay is a strong Rock, called Main Amber, which lies as it
were mounted on others of a smaller size with so equal a Counterpoise, that it
may be stirred, but not moved out of its place. And in S. Cleere's Parish there
are upon a Plain 6 or 8 Stones, such as are upon Salisbury Plain. Which, like
them too, will be mistaken in their telling; so that, when they are told over
again, they will be found either more o^ less than before.

At Boskenna is a Trophy erected, 18 Stone placed round, and pitched 12 foot
from each other, with another in the Center far bigge^ than the rest. And in
many Places hereabout^ are Pieces of Armor, both for Horse and Man, dug out
of the Ground.

Among Seafaring Men, here are (beside^ the Harbors) two Places of chief note
^ viz. the Lizard Point, and the Lands End. The first is the furthest part
South-West of the Goon hilly Downs, a pretty large Tract (...) Ground shooting
forth from the main Land into the South Sea. The Lands End is the furthest
Point Westward of Cornwall, and consequently of England.

Lanceston, the County Town, bears from London West-South-West, and is distant
there from 170 miles. Viz. from London to Salisbury, 70 miles, for the
particulars of which (...) refer you to Wiltshire; from thence to Shaft^ bury,
18; to Sherburn, 12 more; to Axminster 19; to Honiton, 7 more; thence to
Exeter, 12. and to Lanceston, 32 more.

This Town is seated on the banks of a small River called Kensey, and not far
from its fal^ into the Tamer. A Town of good Trade, an^ well inhabited; whose
Market on Saturday^ is well frequented, and served with Provisions. Here are
held the Assizes for this County.

The other Market Towns are Saltash, Sat. Foway, Sat. East-Lowe, Sat. Padstow,
Sat. Grampound, Sat. Tregny, Sat. Helston, Sat. Iiskerd, Sat. B^dmin. Sat.
Stratton, Tue. Truro, Wedn. and Sat. Penrin, Wedn. Frid. and Sat. S. Ives,
Wedn. and Frid. S. Colomb, Thu. Falmouth, Thu. Market-Jew, Thu. Penzance, Thu.
Listhiel, Frid. S. Germans, Frid. Camelford, Frid.


Falmouth, the most-frequented Place in these Parts by Mariners, deserves a
particular Description. First it is called Falmouth, from its Situation at the
Mouth of the River Fale; and that in a fertile Tract of Ground called Roseland,
which contains several Parishes, and feeds great Flocks of Sheep.

The Haven before it is so safe and so capacious, that the Town has thriven of
late very much upon it; the Creeks being coasted with steep Shores, and so
large withal, that 100 Sail of Ships may safely ride at Anchor. Besides, it
lies more in the way of Trade to wind-driven Ships, than Plymouth in
Devonshire. And over against it is the Castle called Pendennis, erected for the
better security of this Coast by King Henry VIII.

But that which adds much of late to the Reputation of Falmouth, is his
Majesty's settling of a Sea-Post here for Spain and Portugal; whereby all
immediate Correspondence with France is interrupted, at least during this
present War, and the Benefit of it cut off from that Kingdom. The Groyn, a
Seaport Town of Gallicia in Spain, is the Place appointed to receive our
Packet^ there; from thence to be distributed through all Places of
Correspondence, both in Spain and Portugal. Lastly, this Town is of some note
for giving the Title of Viscount to the Duke of Northumberland.

Further in the County Northward lies Truro a Town of good note, seated in the
middle o^ two Streams that run into Falmouth Haven and giving the Title of
Baron to the Right Honorable Charles Bodvile Roberts, Earl of Radnor, Penrin,
another Town of note lies something nearer, but to the Northwest of Falmouth,
on a Creek of Falmouth Haven. Penzance and Market-Jew stand over against one
another, West and East of Mounts Bay, the first a good traded Town, the other
but inconsiderable.

Eastward you will find Fouay, East and We^ Iowe, upon the South Sea; and on
the North or Irish Sea, the Havens of Padstow and S. Ives The rest of the
Market Towns are up in the Country.

This County (which formerly was part of the ancient Kingdom of the West
Saxons, and the Inhabitants, together with those of Devonshire, Known among the
old Romans by the Name o^ Danmonii) is now in the Diocese of Exeter.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knight^ of the Shire, no less than 42
Members to sit i^ Parliament, Viz. two out of each of these Towns, Lanceston,
Liskerd, Liskil or Liswithie^ Truro, Bodmin, H^lston, Saltash, Camelford, We^
and East Low, Grampond, Penrin, Tregny, B^^ney, S. Ives, Fouay, S. Germains,
S. Michae^ Newport, S. Mawes, and Kellington.

When this County was under the Earls o^ Cornwall, they gave great Immunities
and Li^erties to those that workt in the Mines. And when this Earldom reverted
to the Crown, in King Edwards Time, he gave it to his Son, surnamed the Black
Prince, advancing that Title to that of a Dukedom, and erected a Lord War^^en
of the Stanneries, to have the Government thereof. Since which time the eldest
Sons of the Kings of England, whether it be by Birth, or by the Death of their
elder Brothers, are ipso facto Dukes of Cornwall, as they are Earls of Chester,
without any Creation; being at age to sue their Livery, how young soever.

Of the Isles of Scilly.
West of Cornwall, about 24 miles distant, ^ies a Cluster of small Islands,
called by us the Isles of Scilly, by the Dutch Sorlings, and by the ancient
Greeks Hesperides from their Western Situation, Cassiterides from the Tin-Mines
they found amongst them. They are reckoned to be 145 in Number, most of 'em
very fruitful in Corn and Pasturage, and plentifully stored with Conies,
Cranes, Swans, He^ons, and other wild Fowl.

Scilly, which communicates its Name to the rest, was formerly counted the
chief of these ^slands. But now S. Mary's has got the pre^minency, being about
8 miles in circuit, the biggest and most fertile of all, having the convenience
of a large and commodious Harbor, and fortified with a strong Castle built in
the Reign of Q. Elizabeth.

These Islands, after the Romans had forsaken their Holds in Britain, returned
again into the power and possession of the Natives. From whom it was subdued,
and added to this Crown, by Athelstane the eighth King of England, and since
that time governed, as a part of Cornwall.

CHAP. VII.
Of Cumberland, Derbyshire, and Devonshire.

Cumberland.
CVMBERLAND is a Maritime County in the North-West Parts of England. Bounded on
the East by Northumberland and Westmorland; on the West, by the Irish Sea; on
the North, by Scotland; on the South by Westmorland and Lancashire.

Its Length from North to South is about 5^ miles; its Breadth, from East to
West, some thing less than 40. The Whole divided, no^ into Hundreds, but Wards,
five in Number wherein 58 Parishes, and 15 Market Towns.

This Country is generally Mountainous, and some of the Hills both very high
and stee^ Those of most note are Skiddaw, Haraknot, Black coum, and Wry-nose.
On the Top of this last on the high Way-side, are placed 3 stones, caled the
Shire-stones, standing within a foot o^ each other, one in this County, another
i^ Westmorland, and the third in Lancashire.

As for Rivers and Meres, here is abundance ^^ them; the principal River known
by the Nam^ of Eden.

Here the Air is pretty sharp and piercing though the Country be something
sheltered b^ the Northern Hills.

And, as hilly as this Country is, yet the Hil^ thereof are not so barren, but
that they feed great Flocks of Sheep, and other Cattle, whilst ^ts fruitful
Valleys bear good Crops of Corn, and its rich Meadows excellent Pasture.

The Sea and Rivers, on the other side, strive ^n a manner to furnish it with
plenty of Fish, and wild Fowl. And, which is remarkable, here they have Muscles
that bear a sort of Pearl.

But, besides Rivers, here are a great many Meers (or Lakes) yielding great
plenty of Fish; but chiefly Vlles Water, bordering both upon Cumberland and
Westmorland.

In the Bowels of the Earth, not only Coals for Fuel, but also Lead and
Copper, are found in great plenty.

Of all the Counties in England, this shows the most Roman Antiquities. The
principal of which is the Picts Wall, a prodigious Stone-wall built by the
Romans for their security, against the Incursion of the raging Picts; the track
whereof in many places is yet to be seen. This Wall was 8 foot broad, and 12
high, reaching cross the Country from Carlisle to Newcastle, that is, from Sea
to Sea, at least 80 miles. Thus it ascended and descended over great Crags and
high Hills, with Watch-Towers erected at every thousand Paces, in which
Soldiers were kept for its Defense.

At Salkeld, on the Eden, is a Trophy of Victory erected, called by the
Inhabitants Long Meg and her Daughters. This Monument consists of ^7 Stones,
each 10 foot above ground, and one of them (namely Long Meg) is 15 foot high.

Carlisle, the chief Place of this County, bears from London North-North-West,
and is distant from it 235 miles, thus. From London to Buckingham 44, for the
particulars of which I refer you to Buckinghamshire; to Coventry 30 more; from
thence to Lichfield, 20; to Sto^ 16 more; thence to Warington, 32; to
^an^^ster, 45; to Kendall, 16 more; and from thence to Carlisle, 32.

A City pleasantly seated on the South Bank of the River Eden, within few miles
of its fa^ into the Sea, being watered besides East an^ West with two lesser
Rivers, the Pettrel an^ Canda, at their fall into the Eden. So that it i^ in a
manner surrounded with three Rivers, except toward the South. This is a Town
o^ great Antiquity, flourishing even in the time o^ the Romans; upon whose
Departure it suffered much by the Scots and Picts. Afterward being utterly
defaced by the Danes, it lay dejected for about 200 years, till William Ruf^^
rebuilt it. After him, Henry the First, hi^ Brother and Successor, made it a
Bishops See. Thus by degrees it recovered it self, being now a fine City, well
inhabited, and a Place of good Trade, chiefly for Fustians. It is begirt with
fine Walls, fortified with a Castle and Cittade^ beautified with a Cathedral of
curious Workmanship, and dignified with the Title of an Earldom, at this time
enjoyed by the Right Honorable Edward Howard Earl of Carlisle, etc. Derived to
him from his Father Charles Howar^ created Earl of Carlisle by King Charles II.
Anno 1661. And the said Charles, Son and He^^ of Sir William Howard, was great
Grand-chil^ of the Lord William Howard, third Son of Thomas Duke of Norfolk. In
the Year 1663. h^ was sent Ambassador Extraordinary by the sai^ King Charles,
to the Courts of Moscovy, Sweden and Denmark. And some Years after, h^ was sent
again, with the same Character, t^ the King of Sweden, to whom he carried the
Garter.

The other Market Towns are Egremont, Sat. Ravenglas, Sat. Keswick, Sat.
Alston-Moor, Sat. Abbey-holm, Sat. Cockermouth, Mund. Perth, Tue. Wigton, Tue.
Brampton, Tue. Bootle, Wedn. White-Haven, Thu. Ireby, Thu. Kirkswald, Thu.
Longtown Thu.


Amongst which Perith, or Penrith, seated between Eimont a River on the
South Side and Lowther another River on the West, is counted the second Town of
note in this County; being large, well built, and inhabited by Tradesmen, but
Tanners especially.

Cockermouth, a goodly Town, is so called from its Situation on the River
Cocker, near its fall into the Derwent, by which two Rivers it is almost
encompassed. It lies about 8 miles from the Sea, between two Hills, upon one of
which stands the Church, and upon the other a Castle. Its chief Trade is of
course broad Clothes, here made. And here is a Custom, common to most other
Market Towns of this County, to hire Servants at their Fairs; to which end such
as want either Service or Servants do resort hither.

Egremont and Ravenglass, are seated not sar from the Sea. The first on the
Banks of a River, over which it has two Bridges. Ravenglass, betwixt two
Rivers, which together with the Sea incompass three Parts of it.

White-Haven, is situate on a Creek of the Sea, at the North end of a Hill,
where is a great Rock (or Quarrey) of hard white Stone, which gives name unto
it. This Harbor is of late much improved in its Buildings, being well
frequented and inhabited, and driving a good Trade to Ireland, Scotland,
Chester, Bristol, and other Places. Whose chief Trade is of Salt, and Coals
here plentifully dug up, for which they bring in exchange several good
Commodities.

Keswick, seated in a Valley hemmed in with Hills, has been a famous Town for
Copper Mines, and much frequented by mineral Men, who had here many Smelting
Houses. But now it is gone to decay. Not far from this Town is dug up Wadd, or
Black Lead, in great plenty.

Formerly they reckoned in this County 25 Castles, few of which are remaining,
most of them being decayed, and gone to ruin.

Lastly, this County (which in the time of the Heptarchy was part of the
Kingdom of Northumberland, and whose Inhabitants, as well as those of most part
of the North besides, were called Brigantes by the ancient Romans) is partly in
the Diocese of Carlisle, and partly in That of Chester. For the South Part of
it, called Copeland, lying betwixt the Rivers Duddon and Darwent, is within the
Arch. Deaconry of Richmond in Chester-Diocese; and all the rest of the County
in the Diocese of Carlisle.

Out of this County; besides the two Knights of the Shire, there are but four
Members chosen to sit in Parliament; 2 from Carlisle, and 2 from Cockermouth.

In the North Parts of it, is a Tract called Gillesland, from whence the Earl
of Carlisle intitles himself Baron Dacre of Gillesland; and South-Westward,
near the Sea, stands the Barony of Millum.

In short, this County became first an Earldom in the Reign of King Henry VIII,
who bestowed the Title upon Henry Lord Clifford, Anno 1525, in whose Issue it
continued till the Year 1642, the last that enjoyed it being also a Henry
Clifford. Of an Earldom it became a Dukedom in the Person of the late
Illustrious Prince Rupert, second Son of Frederick Prince Elector Palatine, and
of Elizabeth his Wife, the only Daughter of King James the first; being Created
Duke of Cumberland, and Earl of Holderness, by King Charles I. his Uncle, Anno
1643. He died without Issue at Whitehall, Nov. 29. 1682. And the Title of Duke
of Cumberland is now in the Person of his Royal Highness, Prince George of
Denmark.

Of the Isle of Man.
The Isle of Man, lying most of it opposite to Cumberland, between this County
and the North of Ireland, this I think therefore to be the most proper Place to
take notice of it.

This Island runs in Length, from North to South, about 30 miles; and in
Breadth, where it is broadest, 10 miles. The Whole divided into two Parts,
North and South; the Inhabitants of the one having affinity with the Scotch,
and the other with the Irish. And in these Parts, defended by Two Castles, are
reckoned 17 Parishes, and but 5 Market Towns.

It is generally an High-land on the Seacoast, and that well guarded with
Rocks. The middle part of it runs up into high Hills. The highest of all,
called Seafull, has this very remarkable in it, That from the Top of it, on a
clear Day, one may easily behold three Kingdoms at once, viz. England,
Scotland, and Ireland; England Eastward, Scotland Northward, and Ireland
Westward.

The Air of this Island is sharp, and subject to high Winds; but it is
healthful. And, as sharp as it is in Winter, yet the Frosts are short, and the
Snow does not ly very long in the Valleys.

The Soil is pretty fruitful, both in Corn and Pasture; affording good store of
Wheat and other Grain, and feeding good Flocks of Sheep and Herds of Cattle,
but none of the biggest size. Here are also red Deer, abundance of Conies, and
Fowl of sundry sorts. In a little adjacent Island, called the Isle of Calf, is
abundance of Puffins, a sort of Sea Fowl that breeds in Cony-holes, chiefly
used for their Feathers, and Oil made of them. But their Flesh being pickled or
salted, as it has a Fish-like taste, so it comes little short of Anchoves. And
as for Fish, both the Sea and Rivers yield great plenty of it.

Its chief Places are Douglas, Laxi, and Rams^y on the East Shore; Rushin, on
the South, and Peel, with its strong Castle, on the West Shore.

'Twas about the Year 1340, that this Island was conquered from the Scots by
William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, who was thereupon honored with the Title
of King of Man. Afterward it was sold to the Lord Scrope; who, being convicted
of Treason, forfeited it to the Crown. Henry IV. gave it to Henry Pierce Earl
of Northumberland, the last that kept it with the Title of King. But, he
proving also false to his Sovereign, the King gave it to William Lord Stanley;
whose Grandchild Thomas Lord Stanley was created Earl of Derby. In whose House
this Estate has continued hitherto, with the Title of Lord of Man, though a
King in effect.

For he has here all kind of Civil Power and Jurisdiction over the Inhabitants,
and the very Nomination of the Bishop of Man; but still under the Fief and
Sovereignty of the Crown of England. And as to the Bishop, he must be presented
to the King for his Royal Assent, then to the Archbishop of York for his
Consecration. Which is the Reason why the Bishop of Man is no Lord of
Parliament, none being admitted to that Honor, but such as hold immediately of
the King himself.

Derbyshire.
DERBYSHIRE, or (as some spell it) DARBYSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded on
the East by Nottinghamshire; on the West, by Cheshire and Staffordshire; on the
North, by Yorkshire; and on the South, by Leicestershire. And it lies so in
respect to the rest of ENGLAND, that the South Parts of this County are in a
manner the Center of it.

It is in Length from North to South, about 34 miles; and in Breadth, from East
to West, 16. The Whole divided into six Hundreds, wherein 106 Parishes, and 10
Market Towns.

The Temperature of the Air of this County is very wholesome, as most of the
Inland Counties are.

Next to the River Trent, wherewith the South Parts of it are irrigated, that
of chief note is Derwent, which crossing the Country from North to South,
empties it self into the Trent, and so divides the County into East and West.

The Soil, in the South and East Parts, is very fruitful, and yields both good
Grass and Corn. But the North and West Parts, being both Hilly and Stony, with
a black and mossy barren Ground, are not so fertile. Yet they are not without
some rich Valleys; and on the Hills themselves are bred abundance of very good
(though not very large) Sheep.

For Fuel, it is not beholden to Wood, the Woods having been destroyed in a
great measure by the Countries Iron-Works, Lead-mines, and Coal-Delfs. But it is
so well stored with Coals, that it supplies with this sort of Fuel many
neighboring Counties, as Leicester, Northampton, Rutland, and Lincoln. Whose
Inhabitants frequently bring Barley to sell at Darby, and load themselves back
with Coals.

For Buildings, it affords, not only good Clay for Bricks, but also store of
Freestone, or durable Greet Stone; and in many parts Limestone, both useful in
Building, and for manuring the Ground. Here is also Alabaster, Crystal, black
and gray Marble, not only very durable, but such as polishes well.

As for Millstones, and Whet-stones, here is whole Quarries of 'em; in the
working whereof a great many hands are employed, before they come to be
dispersed over the Nation.

But the chiefest Commodity of this Country is Lead, which for goodness or
Plenty yields to no Place in the World. Famous for this is the Peak of
Derbyshire, as well as for its Quarries; but particularly for its three
wonderful Caves.

This Peak ly's amongst the Mountains, in the North-West Parts; and its three
Caves, of a wonderful vast height, length, and depth, are known by the Names of
Devils Arse, Eldenhole, and Pools hole. From the Devils Arse a Water comes,
which is said to ebb and flow 4 times in an hour, (as the Well in the Peak
Forest) and to keep its just Tides. Noted besides for the strange
Irregularities of the Rocks within the Water.

Eldenhole is very spacious, but wi^h a low and narrow entrance. The Waters
which trickle down from the top thereof do congeal into Stone, and hang like
Isicles in the root thereof. Some are hollow within, and grow Taper-wise, very
white, and not unlike to Crystal.

But the greatest Wonder of all is that of Buxton-Wells. Nine Springs arise out
of a Rock in the compass of 8 or 9 Yards, eight of which are warm, and the
ninth very cold. These Springs run from under a square Building of Free Stone,
and about 300 foot off receive another hot Spring from a Well enclosed with
four flat Stones; near unto which another very cold Spring bubbles up. These
Waters are experimentally found good for the Stomach and Sinews, and good to
bathe in.

And now I come to Mineral Waters, I cannot but mention Kedlaston Well,
Quarndon and Stanly Springs. The first of which being in Kedl^ston Parish, is
noted for having cured (as it is said) the Leprosy, and for being singular in
the Cure of old Ulcers. Quarndon Springs are two Springs about a mile and a
half from Derby, much of the nature of Tunbridge-Waters in Kent, and the Spaws
in Yorkshire, as strong of the Mineral, and as effectual in the Operation. As
for Stanly-Spring, it is of the same nature, but not so strong.

But about Wirksworth there is a warm and a cold Spring, so near each other,
that one may put one hand in the cold, and the other in the warm.

Derby, the Shire-Town, from whence the County it self is denominated, bears
from London North and by West, and is distant therefrom 98 miles, thus. From
London to Leicester, 78, as you may see in Leicestershire; thence to
Lougborough, 8; and to Derby 12 more.

This Town is seated upon the West Bank of Derwent (from whence probably the
Name of Derby is extracted) over which there is a fine Bridge of free Stone,
and upon the Bridge a Chapel called St. Mary's Chapel. But, besides Derwent,
which empties it self but 6 miles lower into the Trent, this Town has the
Convenience of a Brook rising Westward, and running through it under nine
several Bridges.

It Is a large, populous, and rich Place, few inland Towns equalizing it. Here
are five Parish Churches, of which that of All Saints is the fairest. Whose
Tower-Steeple (in which are 8 tunable Bells) built at the only Charge of the
young Men and Maids about the Reign of Q. Mary, is equalled for height and
beauty by few in the Nation. Here is also a fair Hall, built not many years
since of free Stone at the Counties Charge, where the Assizes are constantly
kept.

In short, it is a Place of good Trade and Resort, no less famous for good Ale
than Banbury for its Cakes and Cheese. Here is chiefly a great Vent for Barley,
which they make into Malt, and so sell it again in Cheshire, Lancashire, and
the North of this County. Its Market is on Fridays, which is very great for
Cattle, Corn, and all Provisions; besides small Markets on Wednesdays, and
Saturdays.

Lastly, this Town is dignified with the Title of an Earldom, now in the person
of the Right Honorable William Stanley, Earl of Derby, and Lord of the Isle of
Man. Descended to him from his Ancestor Thomas Lord Stanley, and of Man,
created Earl of Derby, by King Henry VII. Anno 1486. Which Title was first
enjoyed by the Earls of Ferrers and Derby, and afterward by several Princes of
the Royal Family, till it came (as I said before) to Thomas Lord Stanley, by
Creation.

The other Market Towns are Chesterfield, Sat. Ashbourn, Sat. Alfreton, Mund.
Bakewell, Mund. Wirksworth, Tue. Tideswal, Wedn. Dronfield, Thu. Bolsover,
Frid. Drawfield, --


Amongst which Chesterfield is pleasantly seated in a good Soil, for the most
part on the South Side of a little Hill, and that between two small Rivers. A
Town which, by the Ruins of it, does seem to be of good Antiquity, and
therefore likely to have had some more ancient Name, now buried in its Ruins.
It was made a free Borough in the time of King John. And hard by it was the
Battle fought between King Henry III and his Barons, in which Robert de Ferrers
Earl of Derby being taken Prisoner lost his Estate and Dignity, though not his
Life. But that wherein it has most cause to glory is, that from an ordinary
Market Town, it is become the Seat of an Earldom, the Style and Title of Earl
of Chesterfield being conferred by King Charles I. upon Philip Lord Stanhop of
Shelford, created Earl of Chesterfield Anno 1628. From whom it descended next,
by Henry his eldest Son, to the Right Honorable Philip Lord Stanhop, the
present Earl of Chesterfield.

Wirksworth is so called from the Worth of the Lead-Works. And it is the
greatest Lead-Market in England.

This County (formerly Part of the ancient Kingdom of Mercia, and its
Inhabitants part of the Coritani) is now in the Diocese of Lichfield.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two
Parliament Men, and these two by Derby Town.

But, before I leave this County, I cannot but observe that, of all Parts of
England (which in general is famous for its Stone-Bridges) Derbyshire is of
special note upon that very account. Witness, amongst the rest, Burton-Bridge
on the River Trent, in the Borders of Staffordshire, which has no less than 35
large Stone Arches. 'Twas at this Bridge that Edward II. put to flight Thomas
Earl of Lancaster, and many of the Barons. Here is also Swarkeston Bridge, over
the same River, reputed to be near a mile in length; but much of it is rather a
Causey than a Bridge. To which add Monks-Bridge, over the Dove, to say nothing
more of St. Mary's Bridge at Derby.

Scarsdale, a Division (or Part) of this County, wherein stands Chesterfield,
is a Valley encompassed with Rocks and Mountains, as the Name imports, Dale in
the Saxons Language signifying a Valley, and Scaire a craggy Rock. Observable
only for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable Robert Leak, the
present Earl of Scarsdale. Derived to him from his Father Nicholas, Son of
Francis Leak, Lord Deyncourt of Sutton, Created Earl of Scarsdale by King
Charles I. Anno 1645.

Devonshire
DEVONSHIRE, a Maritime County in the West of England, lies open to the Sea,
both Northward and Southward; on the North being bounded with the North Sea,
otherwise called the Severn Sea, or S. George's Channel, which parts it from
Wales; and on the South, with the South Sea, commonly called the Channel, which
parts England from France. But Eastward it is bounded by Somersetshire and
Dorsetshire; and Westward, by Cornwall.

It contains in Length, from East to West, about 52 miles; in Breadth, from
North to South, 46. The whole divided into 33 Hundreds, wherein 3^4 Parishes,
and 32 Market Towns.

The Air of this County is sharp and wholesome. The Soil, in some Parts,
generally beautified with fresh and pleasant Meadows, in other Parts shaded
with great store of Woods, but in few places not so fit for Corn as most other
Counties. It Is true, good Husbandry supplies that Defect, and adds unto it by
cost and industry what it wants by Nature.

Amongst the many Rivers wherewith it is abundantly watered, the Tamer which
parts it from Cornwall, the Turridge, the Taw, Ex, and Dart are the chiefest.

In short, this County is well provided with Flesh, Fish, and Fowl. And as for
Seafish, Pilchards and Herrings chiefly are here fished in great abundance.
Noted besides for its Wools and Clothings, the best and finest Kerseys in the
Kingdom being here made; but chiefly, for its Tin and Lead-Mines.

Exeter, the chief Place of it, ly's West-South-West from London, about 130
miles, thus. Viz. from London to Salisbury 70 miles, as you may see in the
Description of Wiltshire. From Salisbury to Shaftsbury, 15; and to Sherburn, 12
more; from Sherburn to Crookham, 10; thence to Axminster, 9; and to Exeter, 22
more.

This City is so called from the River Ex, on the East-banks whereof it is
seated, and over which it has a fair Stone bridge, not above 12 or 15 miles
from its fall into the Sea. It Is a large and well compacted City, and a Place
of good Trade. But the River is so choked up, that all Vessels are forced to
load and unload their Goods at Topsham, about 3 miles distance. Within its
Walls and Suburbs are reckoned, besides the Cathedral, no less than 15
Parish-Churches. It has the Privilege of two Markets weekly, kept on
Wednesdays and Fridays.

Noted besides for giving the Title of Duke, Marquess, and Earl to several
noble Personages. Of Duke, to John Holland, Earl of Huntington, made Duke of
Exeter by King Richard II; and to Tho. Beaufort, Earl of Dorset, created Duke
of Exeter by King Henry V. Next to whom this Title was enjoyed by John, and
Henry Holland, both of them Admirals. Afterward the Title of Marquess of
Exeter was by King Henry VIII. conferred upon Henry Courtney, Earl of
Devonshire. Succeeded in it by his Son, Edward Courtney, with whom this Title
died. But in the Reign of King James I, Tho. Cecil, Lord Burleigh, was by that
King created Earl of Exeter, Anno 1605. From whom is descended in a right Line
the Right Honorable John Cecil, the present Earl of Exeter.

The other Market Towns are Kings-bridge, Sat. Plimpton, Sat. Totness, Sat.
Ashburton, Sat. Chidley, Sat. Merton, Sat. Okehampton, Sat. Tavestock, Sat.
Torrington, Sat. Holsworthy, Sat. South-Molton, Sat. Columpton, Sat. Crediton.
Sat. H^rniton, Sat. Axminster, Sat. Plymouth, Mund. and Thu. Bediford, Tue.
Tiverton, Tue. Ottery, Tue. Dodbrook, Wed. Newton-Abbot, Wed. Modberry, Thu.
Culliton, Thu. Bow, Thu. Chu^mleigh, Thu. Dartmouth,, Frid, Barnstaple, Frid,
Hatherly, Frid,


Besides Ilfarcomb, Combemerton, Bradnidge, and Sidmouth, whose Market-Days I
am ignorant of.

Among which Plymouth and Dartmouth are two noted Harbors in the Channel, but
the first especially. Seated between the Tamer and the Plime, at both their
falls into the Sea; the Plime being but a small River, from whence Plymouth
however has took its Denomination. It Is one of the best Ports in England,
having a safe and commodious Haven, strongly fortified on both sides. A Place
of great importance to the Kingdom, not only for his Majesty's, but for
Merchants Ships outward or homeward bound, to anchor in, upon any Casualty. The
Convenience whereof has so improved this Town, from a poor fishing Village,
that it is now grown up to Stateliness. Lastly, this Place is dignified with
the Title of an Earldom, now in the person of the Right Honorable Other
Windsor, Earl of Plymouth, etc. Derived to him from his Grandfather Thomas,
Created Earl of Plymouth by King Charles II. But the first that enjoyed this
Title was Charles Fitz Charles, commonly called Don Carlos, created Baron of
Dartmouth, Viscount Totnes, and Earl of Plymouth, Anno 1675. who soon after
died at Tangier.

Dartmouth, so called from its Situation at the Mouth of the River Dart, is
also a good Port Town, having a commodious Haven, well frequented and traded
unto. There Is in it three Parish Churches. And it gives the Title of Baron to
the Right Honorable George Leg, made Baron of Dartmouth by King Charles II.

Few miles from Dartmouth, to the North-East, is the Bay called Torbay, of
chief note for the Descent here made by his present Majesty and his Landforces
from Holland, upon the fifth of Nov. (being Gunpowder Treason Day) 1688.

From Torbay to the Coast of Dorsetshire, there is not a Sea-Town of any note,
but Sidmouth. Which indeed was a good Port Town, as well as Seaton and Budley
near adjoining, before their Havens were choked up with Sands. Now it is but a
small Fisher-Town.

On the North Coast you will find Combemerton, Ilfarcomb, and Hartland, all of
them but mean Towns.

But, at some distance from that Sea, lies Barnstaple, a good trading Place,
seated on the River Yaw, over which it has a large Bridge.

Further Westward you will find Bediford, Torrington, and Hatherley, all three
on the Towridge. Over which River Bediford has a large Stone Bridge of arched
Work, consisting of 24 Peers; and so high, that a Vessel of 50 or 60 Tuns may
pass under it. Which Accommodation has made it a Place of good account and
trade. Torrington, a pretty large Town, is chiefly noted, for giving the Title
of Earl to the Right Honorable Arthur Herbert, lately created Earl of
Torrington, by our present King, and made Lord Admiral of Their Majesty's
Fleet. Whereas this Title was before in the Person of the Duke of Albemarle
deceased.

Tavestock is seated on the Tave; Modberry, betwixt the Arm and the Aune;
Totness, on the Dart, and Ashburton near it; Chidley, on the Tinge; Crediton,
upon Credit and Forton, both which run into the Ex; Tiverton, at the fall of
the Leman into the Ex; Columpton, on the Culme; Honiton, on the Otter;
Axminster, on the Ax.

Totness, among the rest, is an ancient little Town, about 6 miles from the
Influx of the Dart into the Sea. It stands on the fall of a Hill, lying East
and West. Honored once with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of George,
Lord Carew of Clopton, Created Earl of Totness by King Charles I. Anno 1625. He
was Son of George Carew, Dr. of Divinity, Archdeacon of Totness, and
afterward advanced to the Deanery of Windsor. But, dying without Issue male,
the Title died with him. In the Reign of King Charles II. this Town gave the
Title of Viscount (as is said before) to Charles Fitz Charles, Earl of Plymouth
but that Title also went with him into the Grave.

Tiverton, (otherwise called Twiford-Town) is a Town of good account for the
Cloths he^^ made, which create a good Trade among the Inhabitants.

Crediton, seated betwixt two Hills, and in ^ rich Soil, is divided into two
Parts, the on^ called the East Town, and the other the West. It Is very well
inhabited, and drives a good Trade of Serges. There is a fair Church in it,
built Cathedral-wise; this Town having been formerly the Bishops See, before it
was by King Edward the Confessor transferred to Exeter.

Lastly, this County (which formerly wa^ Part of the Kingdom of the
West Saxons, and its Inhabitants, together with those of Cornwall, known by the
name of Danmonii, among the ancient Romans) is now in the Diocese o^ Exeter.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, no less than 2^
Members to sit in Parliament. Viz. two ou^ of each of these following Towns,
Exeter, Plymouth, Plimpton, Totness, Okehampton, Honito^ Barnstaple, Tavestock,
Ashburton, Tiverton, Bera^stan, and two more out of these three Town^ Clifton,
Dartmouth, and Hardness.

This County has had Earls of several Families. Of which the Rivers and
Courtneys hel^ the Title long, as now the Cavendishes may do, who have
possession of it in the fourth Generation. The first Earl of this Family was
William Lord Cavendish of Harwick, created Earl of Devon by King James I. Anno
1618. And from him is descended in a right Line the Right Honorable William
Cavendish, the present Earl of Devonshire, Lord Steward of the King's Household.

To conclude, over against Devonshire, a good way off in the Severn Sea, is an
Island called Lundey, not above 5 miles long, and 2 broad; but begirt about
with dangerous unapproachable Rocks, having but one entrance into it, and that
so narrow, that two men can hardly go abreast. An Island, though situate in
the midst of the salt and brackish Ocean, far enough from any Land, that yields
notwithstanding many Springs of fresh Water for the Use of its Inhabitants, who
dwell for the most part in a Town of the same Name with the Island.

CHAP. VIII.
Of Dorsetshire, Durham, and Essex.

Dorsetshire
DORSETSHIRE, or the County of Dorset, is another Maritime County in the West
of England. Bounded Eastward by Hampshire; Westward, by Devonshire and
Somersetshire; Northward, by Wiltshire, and part of Somersetshire; and
Southward, by the British Sea, commonly called the Channel.

Its Length from East to West is about 4^ miles; and its Breadth, where
broadest, 25. The Whole divided into 29 Hundreds wherein 248 Parishes, and 29
Marke^ Towns.

Here the Air is very good and healthful, an^ the Country as pleasant, being
watered wit^ many fine Streams, gliding through its ric^ Meadows. The principal
whereof are the Stower, and the From.

The Soil is fat and fruitful, abounding with rich Pastures, and such
Cornfieldsd as seldom deceive the hopes of the Husbandman. S^ that here is
abundance of great and smal^ Cattle, and commonly great plenty of Corn.

The North Parts, being somewhat flat, have the richest Meadows, and are not
destitute of Woods and Timber Trees; but in Winter sadly clogged with Dirt. An
Inconveniency the South Parts are freer from, as consisting most of Hills or
Downs, which being overspread with innumerable Flocks of Sheep, proves no small
profit to the Inhabitants. And here are many (though not large) Valleys, in
which most Towns and Gentlemen's Houses are seated, the better to avoid those
sharp Blasts this Southern Part is subject unto, lying so open and destitute of
Woods as it does.

Fish and wild Fowl here is great plenty of, both from its Sea and Rivers.

Dorchester, the chief Place hereof, bears from London South-West and by West,
and is distant therefrom, about 100 miles, thus. To Basingstoke, 39; from
thence to Stokebridge, 16; to Dunkton, 12 more; thence to Cranburn, 9; to
Blandford, 9 more; and 12 from thence to Dorchester.

A Town of great antiquity, as appears by ^any pieces of the Roman Coin found
near (...). Once of a large Compass, as may be con^ctured by the tract of the
Walls and Trenches; ^ut so spoiled and plundered by the Danes, who ^^so pulled
down the Walls, that it could never ^ecover its former wealth and beauty.

It was also fortified and set out with a ^oodly Castle; which, being decayed
and ruin^us, was converted into a Monastery, and after^ards demolished. I come
now to its present ^tate.

This Town is pleasantly seated on the South^^de of the River From, and on the
Roman Causey called Via fossa, about 5 miles from the ^ea. It consists of three
fair Streets, and as ma^y Parish Churches; the Inhabitants driving a Trade of
Kersies, and other Things. Here is (...) good Market kept on Saturdays, and
this is the Place where the County Assizes are also kept. Noted besides for the
Title of Marquess it gave ^nce to Henry Lord Pierrepont, Created Marquess ^f
Dorchester by King Charles I. Anno 1645. And in the late Reign, for giving the
Title of Countess to the Lady Catherine Sidley, advanced ^o that Dignity by
King James the Second.

The other Market Towns are Shaftsbury Sat. ^landford Sat. ^arham Sat.
Middleton, Mund. Pool, Mund. and Thu. Weymouth Tue. and Frid. Melcomb Regis
Tue. and Frid. Cerne-Abbas Wedn. Cranborn Wedn. Abbots-Bury Thu. Corfe-Castle
Thu. Sturminster Thu. Frampton Thu. Sherburn, Thu. and Sat. Wimbern Minster,
Frid. Lime, Bridport Evershot Bemyster


Among which Lime, Bridport, Weymouth, and Melcomb Regis, Pool, and Warham, are
so many Harbors, and Weymouth the principal.

Now Weymouth and Melcomb Regis stand opposite to one another, on each side the
River Wey, where it falls into the Sea. But, of the two, Melcomb much surpasses
Weymouth for Convenience of Situation and Buildings. And yet abroad all goes
now under the Name of Weymouth, since they were both, by Act of Parliament,
made but one Corporation; and the Occasion of it thus. These two Towns having
for some time enjoyed alike the Privileges and Immunities of the Haven, lying
in the bosom of them, at last there arose a great Controversy between them.
And, by their continual Suits, they still wearied the Lords of the Council and
the Judges, till by an Act of Parliament in the Reign of Q. Elizabeth they were
Incorporated into one Body, to be governed by one Mayor, with Aldermen, and
other Sub-Officers. Upon which immediately they joined themselves together by a
fair Bridge of Timber now in being; but stil^ they send each of 'em two
Burgesses to Parliament. Lastly, Weymouth is of some note besides, for giving
the Title of Viscount to the Right Honorable Tho. Thynne, the present Viscount
Weymouth.

Lime, otherwise called Lime Regis, is seated in the Borders next to
Devonshire, and is so named from a River of that Name, which run^ through the
midst of the Town, and falls into the Sea. The Town is large, and its Cobb
(...) safe Harbor. Which, being industriously made in the Sea for Ships to
ride in, is as carefully looked afer, and kept in good repair.

This Place is noted most of all for the late Duke of Monmouth's Landing here
with his small Force from Holland in the late Reign, which brought him shortly
after to his tragical End. Near unto it is Charmouth a Village, where the Danes
did twice land their Forces, when they came to subdue England.

Bridport, East from Lime, was a Town of good account in Edward the Confessor's
Time. It Is seated low and dirty, not above 2 miles from the Sea, between two
Rivers, that meeting with a little Rill about a mile lower mix their Streams
together, and make a fit Place for a good Harbor, as it was in former times.
But now it is choakt up with Sands. The Town however is still a good
Market Town, and chiefly noted for Hemp. Insomuch that once 'twas the only
Place appointed for the twisting of Cordage and Ropes for the Navy of England,
as well in respect of the adjoining Soil yielding great store of excellent
Hemp, as for the skill of the People in twisting it.

Pool, a Haven-Town in the furthest East Parts of this County, is so seated
upon an In^et of the Sea (called Luckford Lake) that it is enclosed on all sides
with it; except Northward, where it admits entrance only by one Gate.

This Town, from a mean Hamlet consisting of a few Fishermens-Houses in the
Reign of Edward III, grew to be a Market Town of good Trade; and, by reason of
its large and safe Harbor, increased so that Henry VI. granted it the
Privilege of a Haven, and licensed the Mayor to wall it in. Then began the
Inhabitants to abound in Wealth; who, to free themselves from Subjection to the
County, purchased the Privilege of (...) County. But now it has lost much of
its former glory.

In this Haven the Sea, contrary to all other Parts in England, ebbs and flows
(...) times in 24 hours. Viz. first at a South-East and North-West Moon, and
the secon^ time at a South-by-East and a North-by-We^^ Moon.

Warham is seated on the West of, and opposite to Pool, at the Influx of the
From an^ Biddle into Luckford Lake. Where it had (...) good Harbor for Ships,
with all the Advantages of a strong Wall defended by a Castle, and of rich
Inhabitants. Till being crushed by the frequent Shocks of ill Fortune, nothing
o^ its ancient Glory remained but the Shadow* its Castle being wholly ruinated,
its Have^ choked up, and most of its Churches pulle^ down and demolished.

Shaftsbury, an Inland Town, lies in the Northern Verge of this County, and
near the Borders of Wiltshire. It stands lofty upon a high Hill, in the form of
a full-bent Bow* where it injoys not only a serene and healthfu^ Air, but also
a large and delightful Prospect^ Here Canute, the first Danish King that swayed
the English Scepter, ended his Days. I^ its flourishing Time it had ten Parish
Churches, now reduced to three; to which belong about 500 Houses, built of free
Stone, with which the Hill abounds. Its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is
very considerable for mo^^ sorts of Provisions, and far exceeding all the
adjacent Market Towns. Lastly, in the Reig^ of Charles the Second, it was
honored in giving the Title of Earl to that sagacious Statesman, Anthony Earl
of Shaftsbury; since devolved by his death to his eldest Son and Heir, the
Right Honorable Anthony Ash^ey Cooper, the present Earl of Shaftsbury.

Sturminster, Blandford, and Wimborn-minster, are all three seated on the River
Stowr. Over which Sturminster has a fair Stone Bridge, leading to Newton; a
noted Place for the remains of an ancient Castle near adjoining, which was the
Seat of the West Saxon Kings.

Blandford is a fair, large, and well compacted Town, well inhabited, and
neighboured with Gentry. Wimborn-Minster, is seated in a ^ertile Soil, and is
pretty well frequented and ^nhabited. But it is a Town of more antiquity, ^han
beauty.

Cranborn and Sherburn are also Towns of great ^ntiquity, The first seated near
the Spring of a River that runs into the Stowr, and having a Chase which
extends it self almost to Salisbury. Sherborn, on the Ill, is fairly seated,
and well watered. It Is divided into two Parts, that which lies near the Castle
(which is old, and in part ruinated) being called the Castle-Town.

Middleton, Cerne-Abbas, and Frampton do not ^y far asunder. All three but
mean, and the first two (being old Abby-Towns) considerable only by their
Antiquity. But, of the two, C^rne-Abbas has the advantage; being seated in a
dry bottom, watered with a fine Rivulet, and in a Champain Country, affording
great delight both for the Hawk and Hound. Framp^on is likewise pleasantly
seated upon a good River, which affords plenty of Fish, and amongst them
excellent Trouts.

In this County is a noted Castle, called Lulworth Castle, being counted the
best Seat in the whole County, either for Situation or Beauty. The same has a
very fair Prospect into the Sea, and a large Park about it, well furnished with
Deer; and has been sometimes honored with the presence of our Kings in their
Western Progresses.

Of Portland and Purbeck.
I should now have done with Dorsetshire, but that it were improper to leave it
so, without taking notice of its two Peninsules, which generally go by the name
of Islands. And those two are Portland, and Purbeck.

Portland is that Tract of Ground which runs South from Weymouth some miles
into the Sea. A Place of great strength, both by Nature and Art; being
surrounded with inaccessible Rocks, except at the very Place of Landing, where
stands a strong Castle called Portland Castle, built by Henry VIII. And, almost
opposite to it on the Lands side toward Weymouth, stands another called
Sandford Castle. Which two Castles command all Ships that pass into this Road.

The whole Peninsule does show it self from the top of the Rocks in a Flat, and
is in compass about 7 miles. The Ground is very good for Corn, and indifferent
for Pasture but so destitute of Wood and other Fewe^ that the Inhabitants are
fain to dry their Cow Dung, and burn it. Which Defect i^ made up another way,
by its Quarries o^ excellent free Stone for Building; and tha^ in such plenty,
that they make use of it for their Fences.

On the South-East-side stands the only Church in the Isle, and that so near
the Sea^ that, to fence it from its furious Waves, the Churchyard Banks were
fain to be walled to an incredible height. And here it is that Portland Race
shows it self. For so they call the Meeting of the two Tides here, with so
great striving and beating of the Waves, that it is not safe, even in the
calmest Season, for Barks to pass over it.

This Peninsule has been dignified with the Title of an Earldom, first in the
person of Richard Weston, created Earl of Portland by King Charles I. Anno
1632; and continued in his Son Jeremy, then in Charles Son and Heir of Jeremy,
and lastly in Thomas Weston Uncle to Charles, the late Earl of Portland. But
since the late Revolution, our present King was pleased to confer this Title
upon the Right Honorable William Bentinck, the present Earl of Portland, and
Groom of the Stole to His Majesty.

East of Portland lies Purbeck, an Island (or rather a Peninsule) that takes up
the South-East part of this County, about 10 miles in length and 6 in breadth,
reaching from Luckford Lake to the Channel. So that it is surrounded with the
Sea North, East, and South; and Westward with Rivers, within less than a ^ile.
In this Compass of Ground are many small Towns, whereof Corfe is the chief.
Seated on the banks of a River running through the middle parts of Purbeck into
Luckford Lake; and that in a barren Soil, betwixt two Hills, upon one of which
stands a Castle, called from ^he Town Corfe-Castle. A Castle that had great
Privileges granted to the Lords thereof; ^s the free Warren Chase over all the
Isle, ^ea-wracks, Freedom from the Lord Admiral ^f England, etc.

To conclude, this County (formerly Part of the Kingdom of the West Saxons, and
its Inhabitants the ancient Durotriges) is now in the Diocese of Bristol.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 18 Members of
Parliament. Viz. two out of each of these following Towns, Dorchester, Pool,
Lime, Weymouth, Melcomb Regis, Bridport, Shaftsbury, Warham, and Corfe-Castle.

Of this County there have been both Marquesses and Earls; the Title of
Marquess first enjoyed by the Beauforts, and after them by the Greys, the last
that possessed it being Henry Gray, Duke of Suffolk, who was beheaded in the
Year 1553. The Title of Earl was conferred by King James I. upon Thomas
Sackvil, Lord Buckhurst, created Earl of Dorset Anno 1603, in whose Line it has
continued hitherto, the present Earl hereof being the Right Honorable Charles
Sackvil, Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, and Lord High Chamberlain of his
Majesty's Household.

Durham.
DVRHAM, a Maritime County in the North of England, is bounded Eastward by the
German Ocean; Westward, by Cumberlan^ and Westmorland; Northward, by
Northumberland; and Southward, by the River Tees, which parts it from Yorkshire.

Its Length, from East to West, is about 3^ miles; its Breadth, from North to
South, 30 The Whole divided into four Wakes, (no^ Hundreds) wherein 118
Parishes, and 6 Ma^ket-Towns.

Here the Air is pretty sharp and keen, no^ only by reason of the Climate, but
because (...) its Hilliness, especially the West Parts of i^ So true it is,
that those Northern Counties which are so nearly related to Scotland by their
Situation, participate likewise of its nature.

This County is so well watered, what with the Sea, and what with the Rivers,
that it is almost encompassed with Water. Next to the River Tine which parts it
for some miles from Northumberland, and the Tees from Yorkshire, here is the
Ware which runs through Durham, and Derwent into the Tine.

As the Soil of it is different, so it is in some Parts fertile, in others
barren, and accordingly inhabited. The Eastern Part is Champain, and bears
plenty of Coal; the Southern is the most fertile; the Western is hilly and
barren, and thin of Woods and Towns. But it is recompensed by its Store of
Coal, Lead, and Iron Mines.

Durham, the County Town, bears from London North by West, and is distant
therefrom (by common Computation) 200 miles. That is 150 miles to York, for the
Particulars of which I refer you to Yorkshire; and 50 miles more to Durham.
Viz. from York to Boroughbridge, 13; to North-Allerton, 13 more; 10 from thence
to Darlington; and 14 more to Durham.

Whose Situation is upon Hills and Bottoms of Hills, all surrounded with Hills;
but the ^ow Parts watered with the River Ware, which incircles the best Part of
it, and over which there are two Stone-Bridges. If what Mr. Bloom says of it in
his Britannia was true when it was published, the Case is altered. I have been
often upon the Place, but could never find it fair and neatly compacted, nor so
beautified as he represents it, nor its Marketplace so spacious, nor its Trade
so flourishing. On the contrary, it is a good retiring Place, free from the
noise and hurry of Trade; unless it be upon Saturdays, on which Day the Market
is kept. Here indeed one may live plentifuly, and breath good Air, at an easy
rate.

The greatest Ornament of this Place is the Castle, and the Cathedral. The
Castle where the Bishop makes his Residence, is (I confess) a stately Fabric,
raised on the top of a Hill by William the Conqueror, with all the Advantages
both of a Palace and a Castle. Over against it, on the same Hill, stands the
Cathedral, whose Structure has this Defect, that it is built of a soft
mouldering Stone. Between both these is a spacious Place, called the Green. On
one side whereof is the Hall where the Assizes are kept, with a handsome public
Library erected and founded by Dr. Cosins, the late Bishop of Durham; and on
the other side, a Row of Almshouses, the standing Fruits of his Charity.

At Nevils Cross, near Durham, a bloody Battle was fought the 20th of Oct.
1346, between the English and the Scots; where David Bruce, King of Scots, was
taken Prisoner by one Copland, a Man of a mean degree, but Knighted for this
Action. Then was Queen Philip, Wife to King Edward III, in person in the Field;
the Battle being managed by the Lords Mowbray, Percy, and Nevil.

The Market Towns, besides Durham it self, are Darlington, Mund.
Bernard-Castle, Wedn. Bishop Aukland, Thu. Sunderland, Frid. and Stainthorp


Darlington, is a good large Town, seated upon two Rivers, the Skerne, and a
Rivulet that runs there into it. Over the first, which falls within 2 miles
into the Tees, it has a fair Stone Bridge.

Not far from hence, at Oxenhall, are 3 Pits called Hell-Kettles, of a
wonderful depth, supposed to come of an Earthquake that happened in the Year
1179. It Is said of Bishop Tunstall of this Diocese, that he took a Goose which
he marked, and put into one of the Pits; and the same Goose was found afterward
in the River Tees.

Bernard Castle is seated in a Bottom, on the River Tees, and adjoining to
Marwood Park. It Is but an indifferent Town, and of chief note for Stockings
here made.

Bishop Aukland is pleasantly seated on the side of a Hill, between the Ware
(over which it has a Bridge) and a Rivulet that runs into it. This is a neat
Town, and noted for its good Air. But that which adds much to its Reputation is
its stately Castle, the Bishops Summer Palace, beautifully repaired by Dr.
Cosins the late Bishop of Durham; and a fine Chapel, raised by the same Bishop
from its Ruins.

Sunderland is a Sea-Town, on the Mouth of the River Ware. Called Sunderland,
because by the Working of the Sea it is in a manner pulled from the rest of the
Land, it being at high Water environed on all sides with the Sea. This is a
noted Place for its Sea-Coal Trade; but chiefly for giving the Title of Earl,
first to Emanuel Lord Scrope of Bolton, and Lord President of the North,
created Earl of Sunderland by King Charles I. Anno 1627. Upon whose Death,
without lawful Issue, the Title was bestowed by the same King upon Henry Lord
Spencer of Wormleighton, in the Year 1643. Who, being slain the same Year at
the first Newberry Fight, the Title fell to Robert, his Son and Heir, the
present Earl of Sunderland.

Stainthorp, or Staindrop, ly's but 5 miles East-North-East from Bernard
Castle, among Parks, and on a Rivulet that runs from thence into the Tees. And
not far from it is another Castle, called Raby-Castle, which King Canute gave
to the Church of Durham, with the Lands about it.

But, besides the said Market Towns, here is in the South-East Parts Stockton
and Billingham, noted for their strong Ale; And further Northward Hartlepool,
that stands upon a Neck of Land shooting forth into the Sea, which surrounds it
on all sides, except Westward.

On the Mouth of the River Tine you will find Sheals, where the New Castle
Coal-Fleet takes its Cargo. A little higher stands Jarrow, noted for being the
Birth place of the Venerable Beda. And, over against Newcastle, Gateshead or
Gateside, the Receptacle of those numerous Men that work in the Coal-pits. Men
that rake their mean Subsistence from the very Bowels of the Earth.

This County was formerly called St. Cuthberts Patrimony, from S. Cuthbert, the
Raiser of Durham; whose Episcopal See was removed hither from Lindisfarn, or
Holy Island, on the Coast of Northumberland. A Saint for whom several of the
Saxon Kings, and after them Canute the Dane, had so great a Veneration, that
upon him, and his Successors in that See, was all the Country between Tees and
Tine conferred by Alfred King of England. Which his Donation was confirmed, and
in part increased, by his Successors Edward, Athelstan, and Canute the Dane. So
fortified it was with Privileges and Royal Grants, that, at the coming in of
the Norman Conqueror, the Bishop was reputed for a Count Palatine, and did
ingrave upon his Seal an armed Knight, holding a naked Sword in one hand, and
in the other the Bishops Arms. Nay, it was once adjudged in Law, that the
Bishop was to have all Forfeitures and Escheats within the Liberties, as the
King had without. In short, the Bishops hereof had the Royalty of Princes,
having their own Courts of Judicature both for Civil and Criminal Causes, and
covning their own Coin. But these exorbitant Privileges and Immunities were in
part impaired by a Statute under Henry VIII, and altogether with the Lands and
whole Rights thereof conferred upon the Crown by Act of Parliament in the last
Year of the Reign of Edward VI.

To conclude, when England was divided into seven Kingdoms, this County was
Part of that of Northumberland. And the Inhabitants of it, as well as those of
most part of the North besides, were called Brigantes by the ancient ^omans.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members
to serve in Parliament, for which Durham has the Right of Election.

Essex
ESSEX, another Maritime County, has for its Bounds Eastward, the German Ocean;
Westward, Hartfordshire and Middlesex; Northward, the County of Suffolk; and
Southward, the County of Kent.

This is a pretty large County, being in Length about 45 miles; in Breadth, 36.
The Whole divided into 20 Hundreds, wherein 45 Parishes, and 21 Market Towns.

The same is abundantly irrigated, both with great and small Rivers. For,
besides the Thames which severs it from Kent, the Stower from Suffolk, and the
Lea from Middlesex, here is the Coln, the Chelmer, the Crouch, and the Roding,
with several others; in all which are great plenty of Fish.

Here the Air is very Temperate; but down in the Hundreds toward the Seaside
it is very Aguish.

The Soil for the most part is good, and in some Parts so fruitful, that
(according to the Author of Englands Remarqnes) after 3 Years Glebe of Saffron,
the Land for 18 years more will yield plenty of Barley, without any Manuring
with Dung or the like, and then bear Saffron again. One Acre of this Ground
(which is most in the North Part of the County) will yield 80 or 100 weight of
moist Saffron in a Year, which being dried is valued 2. pound sterling.

Its chief Commodities, besides Saffron as aforesaid, are Cloths, Stuffs, Hops,
and the best of Oysters.

Colchester, the chief Place of it, bears from London North-East, and is
distant from it, 43 miles, by common Computation. Viz. 10 from London to
Rumford, 5 more to Burntwood, 10 from thence to Chelmsford, and to Colchester
18 more.

A Town of great Antiquity, and built (as some Authors write) by Coilus, the
British Prince, 124 years after Christ's Birth. But yet more Remarkable, for
giving birth to ^ucius, Helena, and Constantine, the first Christian King,
Empress, and Emperor in the World.

Seated it is upon the Rise of a Hill, stretching it self from East to West;
and watered by the River Coln, from whence probably it came to be called
Colchester. And, as it is but 6 miles distant from the Sea, so its Situation
must needs be upon all accounts both pleasant and commodious. It Is a fair and
well built Town, forti^^ed with an old Roman Wall, and having six Gates of
entrance, besides 3 Posterns. Toward the East stands an old Castle, within the
Ruins of a Trench containing about two Acres. In short, there were in it 14
Parish Churches, several of which are now reduced to ruin. But it is still a
Place of good Trade for the Stuffs here made, and of some note for its
excellent Oysters. In short, it is the richest, fairest, and best traded Town in
the whole County, from whence the Earl Rivers takes his Title of Viscount. Yet,
in regard it stands in the extremity of all the County, the Sessions and
Assizes are held most commonly at Chelmsford, which is almost in the middle of
it. Its Market is kept on Saturdays, and is well served with Provisions.

The other Market Towns are, Maldon, Sat. Harwich, Tue. Cogshall, Sat. Manytre,
Tue. Walden, Sat. Billerakey, Tue. Dunmore, Sat. Waltham Abbey, Tue. Hatfield,
Sat. Braintre, Wedn. Raleigh, Sat. Rumford, Wedn. Hornden, Sat. Buntwood, Thu.
Barkin, Sat. Epping, Thu. and Frid. Cheping-Onger Sat. H^ulsteed, Frid.
Cheping-Onger Sat. Chelmsford, Frid. Cheping-Onger Sat. Thanted, Frid.


Among which Maldon and Harwich are two noted Harbors. The first, by the
Romans called Camelodunum, a Town of great antiquity, and the Seat of Cunobelin
King of the Trinobantes, about the Time of Christ's Birth. It Is seated on the
River Chelmer, about 7 miles from the Sea, between which and the Sea ly two
small Isles, called Northey and Osey. It has one Street about a mile in length,
and is well inhabited. In short, it is one of the chief Places in the whole
County; particularly noted for giving the Title of Viscount to the Earl of
Essex.

In the Parts adjoining to this Town are excellent Pastures, which feed store
of Sheep, (amongst other Cattle) of whose milk they make Cheese. And on the
utmost Promontory stood an ancient City of the Romans, called Ithancester,
where the Fortenses with their Captain kept their Station or Guard, in the
Dedination of the Roman Empire, for the Security of these Parts against the
Saxon Rovers. Nothing of which is now remaining, but the Ruins of a thick Wall,
where many Roman Coyns have been found. And out of the Ruins of this City was
built S. Peter's upon the Wall.

Harwich lies the furthest East of any, by the Seaside, and at the mouth of
the River Stower. So that 3 Parts of it are surrounded with Water. The Town is
not large, but well inhabited and frequented; not only for the commodiousness
and safety of its Harbor, but because it is the readiest Passage for Holland,
and the Station for the Packet-Boats employed for that purpose. But there is a
great Inconveniency to the Inhabitants, the Brackishness of its Waters. Which
puts the Inhabitants upon the necessity of being supplied with sweet Water from
other Places.

The Towns of chief note besides are Chelmsford, where the Assizes for the
County are usually held; Burntwood, or Brentwood, a Place of good Antiquity;
Rumford, a great Thoroughfare; and Walden, or Saffron-Walden, seated on an
Ascent, among pleasant Fields of Saffron, from which the Owners reap good
Profit.

Not far from Walden is one of the Royal Houses, called Audley-end, a very
stately Building, built by the Right Honorable Thomas Howard Earl of Suffolk,
then Treasurer of England. And upon the Thames, over against Gravesend in Kent,
stands Tilbury Fort, which commands that Passage.

This County (which formerly was part of the Kingdom of the East Saxons, from
whence it came to be called Essex; and its Inhabitants, together with those of
Middlesex, known among the ancient Romans by the Name of Trinobantes) is now in
the Diocese of London.

Famous, among other things, for giving the Title of Earl to several Families,
as the Mandeviles, the Bohuns, the Bourchiers, Thomas Lord Cromwell, William
Lord Parre and three D'Evreux, before it came to the present Family of the
Capels. And the first Earl of this Name was Arthur Capel, the late Earl of
Essex, advanced to this Title by King Charles II. Anno 1661, afterward made
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and some years after his Return sent to the Tower,
in order to make him a Sacrifice, with the Lord Russel and others, to the
Popish Faction. But his Title is revived in the person of his Son and Heir, the
Right Honorable Algernon Capel, the present Earl of Essex.

Lastly, out of this County are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire,
six Members of Parliament, Viz. two from Colchester, two from Harwich, and two
more from Maldon.

CHAP. IX.
Of Glocestershire, Hampshire, and Hartfordshire.

Glocestershire.
GLOCESTERSHIRE, a large Inland County, is bounded on the East by Warwickshire
and Oxfordshire; on the West, by Monmouthshire and part of Herefordshire,
Northward by Worcestershire; Southward, by Wiltshire and Somersetshire.

It contains in Length, from North to South, 50 miles; and in Breadth, from
East to West, about 25. The Whole divided into 30 Hundreds; wherein 280
Parishes, and 26 Market Towns.

This is in general a most pleasant and fruitful Country, blessed with a full
Course of the River Severn. That Part thereof which is beyond the River is
overspread with Woods; all which, included in one Name, made the Forest of
Dean. That part which buts upon Oxfordshire is swelled up with Hills, called
the Corswold Hills; but these are in a manner covered with Sheep, which yields
a Wool of a notable fineness. Whereof great Quantities of Cloth are here made,
that find vent throughout all England, and diverse foreign Countries. Between
these two, I mean the Forest and the Hills, is seated a most fruitful Vale,
yielding most sorts of Grain to admiration, and formerly stocked with Vines and
Vineyards. The want of which is now supplied with Cider, which they make here
in great abundance.

Next to the Severn, which crosses the Country from North to South, here is the
Avon which parts it from Somersetshire, the Wye which severs it in part from
Monmouthshire, besides the Stroud and the Isis. All which afford great plenty
of Fish, and the Severn particularly abundance of Salmon.

The Forest of Dean, which ly's in the Westside of the County between the
Severn and the Wye, is reckoned to be 20 miles long, and 10 broad. A Place
formerly much more woody than it is at present, the Iron Mines that are here
having consumed a good part of the Wood.

Gloucester, the County Town, is 81 miles distant West and by North from London.
Viz. from London to Colebrook, 15; to Maidenhead, 7 more; and 11 from thence to
Nettlebed; from Nettebed to Abington, 12; to Faringdon, 10 more; to Perrors
Bridge, 14 more; and 12 from thence to Gloucester.

A City of good Antiquity, and first built by the Romans, to whom it was known
by the Name of Glevum. It ly's stretched out in length on the Severn, over
which it has a fine Bridge, and on the Banks thereof a large Key or Wharf, very
commodious for the Merchandise and Trade of the Place. The Streets are
generally fair, and the Town well built upon an easy Ascent, the Streets
descending every way from the Cross. It has been formerly walled about with a
strong Wall, except on the Rivers side; and some Remains of its Walls are still
in many places to be seen, which show what strength they were of.

The City is not very large, but very well inhabited and frequented, and
enjoying a good Trade. It has two Markets a Week, viz. Wednesdays and
Saturdays, which are very great for Corn and Cattle, and well served with all
Provisions. And, for Divine Worship, here are twelve Parish-Churches; besides
the Cathedral, a fine piece of Architecture, noted amongst other things for its
Whispering Place, which is in an Arch of the Quire? but chiefly for being the
Burying-place of Lucius, the first Christian King; and of the unfortunate King
Edward II. who at Barkley-Castle was barbarously murdered by the Cruelty of
Isabel his Wife.

Lastly, this City is both a Bishops See, and a County of it self, being made a
County by King Richard III, once Duke of Gloucester. And, as it has the
advantage of denominating so rich a Country as this, so it has been often
dignified with the Title of a Dukedom, sometimes that of an Earldom, in those
eminent Persons who in their several Times and Ages have been either Dukes or
Earls of Gloucester. The Number of 'em is too great for me to produce 'em all
here. Therefore I shall only say, that the last Duke of Gloucester was Henry,
the third Son of King Charles I, declared by his Royal Father Duke of
Gloucester, and Earl of Cambridge, and so Entitled Anno 1641, but not so
created till the Year 1659. He lived to see the Restoration of the Royal
Family, and died the same Year it happened, viz. Sept. 13. 1660. With him the
Title has lain dormant, till it was lately revived in the person of the young
Prince William, the Son of the Illustrious Prince George of Denmark.

Nigh to this City is Alney-Isle, so made by the Severn. In which Edmund
Ironside King of the English Saxons, and Canute the Dane, after many Conflicts
and bloody Battles, fought a single Combat hand to hand, for the Crown of
England. The Issue of which was, that they agreed to part the Kingdom; which
they jointly governed, till Treason took away the Life of King Edmund, and left
Canute sole Monarch of England.

At Lassington, a mile from Gloucester, is found a sort of Stone, called the
Star-Stone, being about the breadth of a Silver Penny, and the thickness of a
Half-crown. These Stones are flat, and (like a Star) five-pointed; of a grayish
color, and on the flat sides naturally engraven in fine Works, as one Mullet
within another.

The other Market Towns, besides Gloucester it self, are Bristol, Sat. and Wedn.
Tewksbury, Sat. Winchcomb, Sat. Leonards Stanley, Sat. Thornbury, Sat.
Wickware, Mun. Dean Magna, Mun. Cirencester, Mun. and Frid. Panswick, Tue.
Horton, Tue. Minching-hampton Tue. Marshfield, Tue. Letchlade, Tue. Campden,
Wedn. Blackley, Wedn. Tedbury, Wedn. Stow on the Would. Thu. Cheltenham, Thu.
Dursbey, Thu. Chipping Sudbury, Thu. Fairford, Thu. Stroud, Frid. Wotton, Frid.
Newent, Frid. Newham, Frid.


Amongst which Bristol, being not only the greatest Place of Trade in England
next to London, but also a Bishops See, and a County of it self, deserves a
particular Description. It is both pleasantly and commodiously seated at the
fall of the From into the Avon, which five Miles from thence empties it self
into the Severn. By this River the City is divided into two Parts, the chief
Part in Glocestershire, and the other in Somersetshire, but with the
convenience of Communication by means of a fair Stone Bridge. Which (like
London Bridge) is so covered with Houses, that it looks more like a Street than
a Bridge. Its Streets are neatly ordered, and set out with many fine Edifices.
Among which may be reckoned the Cathedral, and most of the Parish Churches,
which are 18 in Number. The City is begirt with a Wall, besides other
Fortifications. At the East end of it stood a Castle, wherein King Stephen was
kept a Prisoner by Maud the Empress. But it was demolished by Oliver Cromwell,
and is now built into Streets, called Castle-street and Castle-Green.

But that which has chiefly made Bristol so considerable is the goodness of its
Port. The principal Key whereof stands on the From, which at Spring-Tides does
flow about 40 Foot, and so brings Ships in of a great Burden. Thus Bristol, by
its Commodiousness for Shipping, is become a Place of great Resort both for
Merchants and Tradesmen; those driving a great Trade to most Parts of the Known
World, these a Home-Trade, especially to Wales, to Shropshire, and other
Counties.

About Bristol is great store of Coals; also, a sort of Precious Stone, called
from thence Bristol-Stones, taken out of S. Vincents Rock. At the bottom
whereof is a hot Well, of a Medicinal nature.

Lastly, though Bristol stands partly (as I said before) in this County, and
partly in Somersetshire; yet, as it is a County of it self, it yields Obedience
to neither. And considering its Beauty, Trade, Riches, Extent, and
Populousness, it may be counted the chief Place in England, next to London.

It Is but about 150 Years since this Town came to he a Bishops See, this being
one of the six new Sees erected by Henry VIII. by virtue of an Act of
Parliament made in order to it. But it is less since it became a Title of
Nobility, which was not till King James I. conferred the Honor of Earl of
Bristol upon John Lord Digby of Sherburn, Anno 1622. From him devolved by his
Death to his Son George, in the Year 1650, and from him to the Right Hononrable
John Digby, the present Earl of Bristol.

Cirencester, commonly pronounced Circester, is seated on the River Churn, over
which it has a Bridge. It has been a Place of great account in the time of the
Romans; and, without insisting upon the Roman Coyns, Checker-work Pavements,
and engraven Marble Stones, that have often been dug up here, its very ruinous
Walls, still to be seen, and about 2 Miles in Circuit, are a sufficient proof
of its former Greatness. This City was taken from the Britains by the
West Saxons, and afterward possessed by the Mercians, till laid in Ashes by a
Stratagem of the merciless Danes, in tying fire to the Wings of Sparrows, from
whence it came to be called the Sparrows City. Since which Desolation, it could
never recover it self to any thing beyond the Name of a good Borough Town.

Tewksbury is a goodly Town, situate at the fall of the North-Avon into the
Severn, and watered besides with two Rivulets. A Town of good account for
making of Woollen Cloth, and for the best Mustard in the Kingdom, as Dijon is
in France. But most of all memorable for the Battle fought here Anno 1471.
between King Henry VI. and his immediate Successor Edward IV, that is, between
the House of Lancaster and York, where the Lancastrians were entirely defeated,
and the young Prince Edward (the only Son of King Henry) slain.

Stroud, situate on the River so called, is a well built Town, whose Houses for
the most part are of Stone. It has a Bridge over the River, on the Banks of
which are placed abundance of fulling Mills. Here they die Scarlet, the Stroud
Water having a peculiar quality to give the right Tincture.

Near the Severn Banks stands Berkley Castle, which gives Name to a noble and
ancient Family dispersed in many Places of this Kingdom, and whereof they were
made Barons by King Henry the II. Whereas before that time they were called
Fitz-Harding, as being descended from one Robert Fitz-Harding, of the
Blood Royal of the Danes. William Lord Berkley of this House descended from the
Mowbraies (who, amongst other Titles, were Earls of Nottingham) was in the Year
1432 created Viscount Berkley by King Richard III; afterward Earl of
Nottingham, and Earl Marshal, by King Henry VIII; and finally Marquess Berkley,
by the same King Anno 1509. But dying without Issue, all those Titles ended
with him. Only the Title of Lord Berkley continued in the Collateral Line, till
advanced to the Title of Earl by King Charles II. Anno 1679. in the person of
the Right Honorable George, Earl of Berkley, Viscount Dursley, etc.

To conclude, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of Mercia,
and its Inhabitants, with those of Oxfordshire, known among the ancient Romans
by the Name of Dobuni) is now partly in the Diocese of Gloucester, and partly in
that of Bristol.

Ont of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of
Parliament; Viz. 2 out of Gloucester, 2 out of Tewksbury, and 2 more out of
Cirencester. In this Case Bristol is counted in Somersetshire.

Hampshire.
HAMPSHIRE, or HANTSHIRE, otherwise called the County of Southampton, from
Southampton the Shire-Town, is a Maritime County. Bounded on the East by Surrey
and Sussex; on the West, by Wiltshire and Dorsetshire; on the North, by
Barkshire; and on the South, by the Channel, or British Sea.

Its Length, from North to South, is about 46 miles; its Breadth, from East to
West, 30. The Whole divided into 39 Hundreds, wherein 253 Parishes, and 16
Market Towns.

This County is rich in all Commodities, both of Sea and Land; and those Parts
of it which ^y furthest from the Sea, of a pure and excellent Air.

In particular, the Country is well clothed with Wood, affords plenty of Iron,
which is here wrought from the Mines, with abundance of Wool, which the
Inhabitants make Cloths and Kerseys of, and the best sort of Honey.

As for Rivers, here is in the West Parts of the County, the Avon, and the
Stower a Dorsetshire River, which meet together at their fall into the Sea.
More Eastward you will find the Test, and the Itching, which also meet at their
fall into the Sea, and that near Southampton.

In this County is the New Forest, about 30 miles in compass. A Forest which
William the Conqueror so delighted to hunt in, that (to make it complete and
entire) he caused many Towns and Villages, with no less than 36
Parish-Churches, to be pulled down and levelled with the ground. But this
Exorbitance of his did not escape unpunished. For in this very Forest Richard,
his second Son, was goared by a Deer, and died; William, his third Son, was
accidentally slain by Sir Walter Tyrrel; and his Grandchild, Robert Curtoyse,
being in pursuit of the Game, was struck by a Bough into the Jaws, and died.

Southampton, the Shire-Town, bears from London South-West by West, and is
distant therefrom 60 miles, thus. From London to Stanes, 15; to Bagshot, 10
more; thence to Alton, 14; to Alesford, 8 more; from Alesford to Twiford, 7;
and to Southampton, 6 more.

This Town is commodiously seated at the very Mouth of the Rivers Test and
Itching both which Streams being here united together into one go under the
Name of Hampton, which is more like an Arm of the Sea than a River. And it is
capable of Ships of good Burden to the very Key, which is very commodious for
lading and unlading of Ships. Accordingly this Town has flourished for some
time, and enjoyed a great Trade with France especially; being conveniently
seated, opposite to Normandy, and its adjacent Isles, Jersey and Garnsey. It
has been likewise a Place of good Defense, surrounded with a double Ditch, and
strong Walls, with several good Towers, and fortified besides with a Castle. At
present both its Trade and Strength are very much decayed and diminished.
However it is still of that extent as to contain five Parish Churches. And,
though it be within the County, yet it is (as some other Towns) a County of it
self, for which it stands beholding to King Henry VI.

The Bishops of Winchester were anciently reputed to be Earls of Southampton,
and are so styled in the new Statutes of the Garter made by Henry VIII. But
that Title has been since otherwise disposed of; Thomas Wriothesley, Lord
Chancellor, being created Earl of Southampton by King Edward VI. Anno 1547. In
whose Line it has continued, till it died with Thomas Wriothesley, Lord
Treasurer, Anno 1667. In the Reign of Charles II. After whom Charles Fitz-Roy,
Lord Limrick, eldest Son to the Duchess of Cleveland, was created Baron of
Newberry, Earl of Chichester, and Duke of Southampton, Anno 1675.

For Provisions, and other Commodities, this Town has two Markets a Week, viz.
Tuesdays and Fridays.

But, though Southampton be properly the Shire Town, yet the City of Winchester
outloes it upon several accounts, and theresore deserves a particular
Description by it self.

Winchester, the Venta Belgarum of the ancient Romans, is pleasantly seated in
a Valley betwixt Hills, and on the Banks of the River Itching. A City of great
Antiquity, and noted among the Romans for being the Place where the rich
Imbroideries were made for their Emperors. In the time of the Saxons it was
twice consumed by fire, and by them rebuilt; being made the Royal Seat of the
West Saxon Kings, and the chief Episcopal See. Afterward it felt, with many
other Places, the fury of the Danes. In the time of the Normans it was
repaired, and honored with the keeping of the public Records of the Kingdom.
But soon after it had a Relapse, being sore oppressed during the Civil Wars of
Maud the Empress and King Stephen. At last it began in the Reign of Edward III.
to recover it self, having made it the Mart for Wool and Cloth.

At present this City contains, within its Walls, about a mile and a half in
Circuit, but not without some waste. Here is a fine Hall, where the Assizes and
Sessions are kept for the County; and in this Hall hangs up King Arthur's Round
Table, which is kept as a Monument.

For Divine Worship, here are five Parish Churches. Besides the Cathedral, a
large and beautiful Structure, dedicated to the Holy Trinity; and of special
note, for being the Sepulcher of many Saxon Kings and Queens, besides two Kings
of the Danish, and two of the Norman Race. For the Education of Youth, here is
in the Suburbs a fair College, liberally endowed, and a place of good
Literature; built and endowed by William of Wickham for a Seminary to his other
College in Oxford. And for the Relief of the Poor, a very fair Hospital,
called S. Crosles, not far off from the College. Here is also a goodly and
capacious Palace for the Bishops Dwelling, called Wolvesey-House; and, upon a
Hill, a strong Castle, which overlooks the Country.

In short, the City of Winchester is indifferently well peopled, and
frequented. And its reekly Markets, kept on Wednesdays and Saturdays, are well
served with all sorts of Provisions, especially that on Saturdays. Noted
besides, for giving the Title of Marquess to his Grace Charles Paulet, lately
made Duke of Bolton by our present King.

The other Market Towns are Kingsclere, Tue. ^asing-stoke, Wedn. Kingwood,
Wedn. ^lisford, Thu. Portsmouth, Thu. and Sat. Andover, Sat. Ramsey, Sat.
Petersfield, Sat. Lemington, Sat. Odiam, Sat.


Besides Christchurch, and Whitechurch, whose Market-Days I am ignorant of; and
Newport, ^in the Isle of Wight, of which more anon.

Amongst which Portsmouth, the strongest Place in this Kingdom, is seated in
the Isle of Porsey, South-East from Southampton; Which Isle has Communication
on the North with the main Land, by a Bridge. This Place is both a good Harbor
for Ships, and by its strong Fortifications a Shelter to this Country. Here are
Docks and Storehouses for the King to build and equip Men of War; and for its
Defense, two Castles, one in the North, and another in the South, besides other
Fortifications, and a good Garrison withal. But it is counted an unhealthy
Place.

However, it gives the Title of Duchess to a famous French Lady, Louisa de
Querouaille, created Baroness of Petersfield, Countess of Faruham, and Duchess
of Portsmouth, by King Charles II. Anno 1673. A Town noted besides for a Race
of small Dogs like Beagles, bred about it; which hunt Moles, as their natural
Game.

Odiam, seated on the Road, did formerly belong to the Bishops of Winchester.
Near unto it stand the Ruins of an old Castle, once so strong, that in the
Reign of King John, 13 Englishmen kept out the Dauphin of France and his Army
for the space of 15 days.

As for Whitechurch, Stocksbridge, and Rumsey, they are all three seated upon
the Test; Ringwood, upon the Avon; Christ-Church, betwixt the Avon and the
Stower, at their fall into the Sea; and Lemington, East from it, by the
Seaside. Stockbridge, Basingstoke, Petersfield, and Andover, are great
Thorow-fare Towns.

Spithead, a noted Place for being a frequent Rendezvous to the Royal Navy,
lies between Portfmouth and the Isle of Wight.

Of the Isle of Wight.
The Isle of Wight falls next under our Consideration. And as Nature has parted
it from the rest, so in her Imitation, I give you here a separate Account of it.

This Island, being scarce 3 miles from Hurst-Castle, is generally supposed to
have been dismembered from Hampshire by the Sea. It Is about 20 miles in length,
and 12 broad where broadest; of an oval Form, ending with two Peninsules, one
East, and the other West. Naturally fenced about with steep and craggy Rocks,
amongst which the Shingles and the Needles Northwestward are of chief note
amongst Seamen. Southward, where it looks toward France, it is inaccessible;
but, toward the North-East, something flat and level.

The Soil hereof abundantly answers the Pains of the Husband man. So plentiful
it is of Corn and Pasturage, that the Inhabitants have not only sufficient for
themselves, but furnish also the Markets of Portsmouth and Southampton, (but
the first especially,) with the greatest part of the Wheat, Flesh, Cheese, and
Butter, which is spent amongst them. Insomuch that the Soldiers of Portsmouth,
presuming on the strength of that Town, use to say, That as long as they have
the Isle of Wight to their Friend, and the Seas open, they need not care for
all the World besides. And, as the Sea about this Island is exceeding full of
Fish, so is the Land stored almost in all Places with Conies, Hares,
Partridges, and Pheasants. And the Sheep here yield so fine a Fleece, that the
Wool hereof has the precedenty of that of Coteswold in Glocestershire, and is
next in esteem to that of Lemster in Herefordshire.

This Island is divided into two principal Parts, viz. East, and West-Meden;
containing 36 Parishes, and in them 3 Market Towns.

Newport, the chief of all the Isle, stands on the North-East Coast, with a
little Creek before it, where small Vessels come to the very Key, which does
very much facilitate its Trade. It Is a large and populous Town, having two
Markets a Week, viz. Wednesdays and Saturdays.

At the entrance of the aforesaid Creek is Cowes, often mentioned in our
Gazets, a noted place for harboring of Ships, therefore fortified with a
Castle. And a little way West from Newport, stands another, called Caresbrook
Castle.

Yarmouth, the best Town in this Island, next to Newport, is situate on the
North-West Coast. This Town is strengthened with a Castle, and other pieces of
Fortification; most of it is Houses built of Free Stone, and covered with Slate.

In the South-East-Parts is Sandham, on a Bay so called, also fortified with a
Castle. So that here are more Castles in this Spot of Ground, than there is in
any the like Spot in England.

Lastly, this Island, as well as the Isle of Man, has had the honor of being
advanced to the Title of a Kingdom; but either of 'em much more deservedly than
the Lordship of Ivitot in France. 'Twas in the Year 1445, when King Henry VI,
out of his particular affection to Henry Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, crowned
him King of Wight. Which Title ended with his Life about two years after.

Besides this Island, there are to the Eastward of Portsmouth, two lesser
Isles, called Haling and Thorney; and having two Towns of their Name.

This County, whereof the Isle of Wight makes a Part, is in the Diocese of
Winchester, and was formerly part of the Kingdom of the West Saxons. The
Inhabitants whereof, together with those of Wiltshire and Somersetshire, were
known by the Name of Belgae among the ancient Romans.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knight^ of the Shire, no less than 24
Members to serve in Parliament, viz. two out of each of these Towns,
Winchester, Southampton, Portsmouth, Petersfield, Stockbridge, Lemington,
Andover, Christ-church, White-Church; besides these three in the Isle of Wight,
Newport, Yarmouth, and Newton.

Hartfordshire.
HARTFORDSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded on the East by Essex; on the West,
by Buckingham and Bedfordshire; on the North, by Cambridge-shire; and on the
South, by Middlesex.

It contains in Length, from North to South, 30 miles; and in Breadth, from
East to West, 27. The whole divided into eight Hundreds, wherein 120 Parishes,
and 18 Market Towns.

A Country not only blessed with a sweet and wholesome Air, but also with a
fruitful Soil; well watered with fresh and delightful Streams, the principal
whereof are the Lea and the Coln.

Hartford, the Shire-Town, from whence the County took its Name, stands North
by West 20 miles from London, Viz. 10 from London to Barnet, and 10 more to
Hartford.

A Town of great note, in the time of Beda, (by whom named Herudford,) for a
Synod there held in the dawning of the day of Christianity, amongst the Saxons;
in which S. Augustine the Monk, the first Apostle of that People, had a
Conference (or Consultation) with the British Bishops. More memorable, in the
following Times, for giving the Title of an Earl to the Illustrious Family,
surnamed De Clare; the addition of an Honor, and a goodly Patrimony to John of
Gaunt Duke of Lancaster; and at this time the Title of Marquess to the Duke of
Somerset.

This Town is seated on the Lea, much decayed by the turning the Highway
through Ware, and having now but 3 Parish Churches. Here however, is kept the
County Goal, and it is a well frequented Market on Saturdays.

The other Market Towns are S. Albans, Sat. Rickmansworth, Sat. Barnet, Mund.
Berkhamsted, Mund. Buntingford, Mund. Watford, Tue. Ware, Tue. Hitching, Tue.
Hempsted, Thu. Hatfield, Thu. Hodsdon, Thu. Baldock, Thu. Bp. Stretford, Thu.
Stevenedge, Frid. Tringe, Frid. ^toudon, Frid.


Amongst which S. Alhans, seated on the River Coln, was so called from a famous
Monastery here, founded by Offa, the great King of the Mercians, in honor of
St. Albans the Protomartyr of Britain, a Citizen of Verulamium near adjoining
to it. Out of the Ruins whereof (decayed by Age, and destroyed by War) arose
the present S. Albans, the fairest and best traded Town in this County. A Town
which formerly enjoyed great Privileges. For Divine Worship it has now 3
Parish Churches; and in one of 'em ly interred the Bodies of many Nobles, slain
in two Battles fought here between the Houses of York and Lancaster.

This Town has been dignifyed with the several Titles of Viscount, Earl, and
Duke. With the first, Anno 1620, in the Person of Francis Bacon, Viscount S.
Albans, Lord Verulam, and Lord High Chancellor of England. With the Title of
Earl, Anno 1628. in the person of Richard de Burgh, and continued in his Son
Ulick, with whom it dyed; till revived again, Anno 1660. by King Charles II. in
the person of Henry Jermin, the last Earl of St. Albans. Who dying without
Issue, King Charles advanced his Grace Charles Beauclare, Earl of Burford, to
the Title of Duke, by making him Duke of S. Albans.

Ware, Hatfield, and Hodsdon, are all three seated on the Lea. The first a good
Thorough-fare Town, much improved since the Highway was turned from Hartford
hither. Noted besides for the Channel cut from thence to London where it serves
so many hundred Families with the Convenience of that excellent Water, called
New River Water. To which may be added another Observation, the pleasantness
and easiness of the Road from Ware up to London; which being of a Sandy Soil,
proves seldom dirty but within a mile of London, and is so filled with Towns
and Gentlemen's Houses from mile to mile, that one would think the Suburbs of
London on the North side fetch their beginning at Ware. So strange is the
Influence of this rich and populous City.

Hatfield is a Place of great Delight and Recreation; but of chief note for
that stately House called Hatfield House, formerly one of the Kings of Englands
Palaces, till it came in the possession of the Earls of Salisbury. A House
which for Situation, Prospect, Contrivance, and Building, for Air, water, and
all other Accommodations, is inferior to none in England.

Not far from Hodsdon, but nearer to Waltham Abbey in Essex, is Theoballs, one
of the Kings Royal Seats, pleasantly situate among delightful Walks, Gardens,
Groves, and Springs. First built by Sir William Cecil, and afterward
beautifyed by his Son Robert, both Lord Treasurers of England.

Barnet, or high Barnet, is pleasantly seated on a Hill, and in the Road within
ten miles of London. Of some account for its Medicinal Waters; but much more
memorable for a bloody Battle fought here between the two Houses of York and
Lancaster, wherein the former prevailed.

Warford and Rickmansworth are both seated near the Coln. And, not far from the
first, Langley Abbey, the Birthplace of that proud and high-spirited Pope
Adrian IV. first known by Nicholas, and surnamed Break-Spear.

Bishops-Stratford is a great Market Town, seated near the River Stowr, on the
side of a Hill, and much resorted unto. On the East Side whereof are to be seen
the Ruins of a Castle, called the Castle of Waymour, standing very steep in an
Isle upon an artificial Mount, with a dark and deep Dungeon in it, which
denotes some great Privileges to have belonged unto it in former Times. It was
ruinated by King John.

Among the Market Towns here, I might have put in Royston, part of which stands
in this County; but I refer you for it to Cambridgeshire.

In short, this County (which formerly was divided betwixt the Kings of Mercia
and the East Saxons, and whose Inhabitants were part of the Catieuchlani, as
the Romans called them,) stands now divided betwixt the Dioceses of London and
Lincoln.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but four Members
to serve in Parliament; 2 by Hartford, and 2 by St. Albans.

CHAP. X.
Of Herefordshire, Huntingtonshire, and Kent.

Herefordshire.
HEREFORDSHIRE, or the County of Hereford, is an Inland County. Which has for
its Eounds Eastward, Glocestershire and Worcestershire; Westward, Radnockshire
and Brecknockshire in Wales; Northward, Shropshire; and Southward,
Monmouthshire.

Its Length, from North to South, is about 35 miles; its Breadth, from East to
West 30. The Whole divided into 11 Hundreds, wherein 176 Parishes, and but 8
Market Towns.

This County was formerly part of Wales, before it was by Conquest annexed to
this Crown. And then it was strengthened with no less than 28 Castles, whereof
there is scarce any thing now remaining but their Ruins.

Here the Air is temperate and healthful; and the Soil exceeding rich. It Is well
clothed with Wood, and refreshed with Rivers; the principal of which are the
Wye, Lug, Arrow, and From.

Two Things this County excels in, its plenty of Fruit, and the finest Wool in
any part of England. And, amongst all sorts of Fruits, the Red-streak Apple
(which makes the best sort of Cider) is that which thrives here to admiration.

Hereford, the chief Place hereof, bears West-North-West from London, and is
distant from it 101 miles, thus. From London to Gloucester, 81 miles, as you may
see in Glocestershire; then from Gloucester to Ross, 10 miles; and to Hereford
10 more.

It Is seated on the Banks of the River Wye, and another that, runs into it,
amongst rich^ Meadows and plentiful Cornfieldsd. Raised out of the Ruins of
Ariconium, a Place of good account in the time of the Romans. It had once a
strong and stately Castle, built by the Normans, which Time has now ruinated.
And now it is walled about, having six Gates for entrance, and 15 Watch-Towers
for defense. 'Twas a Bishops See in the time of the Britains, and restored to
that Dignity by the Saxons Anno 680. Noted besides, for giving first the Title
of Earl, then that of Duke, and lastly that of Viscount, now in the Person of
the Right Honorable Edward D'Evreux, Viscount Hereford, etc. Descended to him
from his Ancestor Sir Walter D'Evreux; who, on the Death of Robert D'Evreux,
Viscount Hereford, and Earl of Essex, succeeded in the Title of Viscount, Anno
1646.

Here are three Markets a Week, viz. on Wednesdav, Friday, and Saturday. And,
in point of Trade, this Place is particularly noted for the Gloves here made,
and vended in great quantities in London and elsewhere.

The other Market Towns are Bramyeard, Mund. Pembridge, Tue. Lidbury, Tue.
Kyneton, Wedn. Webley, Thu. Rosse, Thu. Lemster, Frid


Among which Pembridge and Kyneton are seated on the River Arrow; Rosse, on the
Wye; and Lemster, on the Lug. This last of chief note for the fine Wool which
the Sheep in its Neighborhood bear, and likewise for its fine Wheat and
Flower; as Webley is for its good Ale.

At Kyneton, a pretty large and well built Town, they drive a good I rade for
narrow Cloths; and the Market is counted the best for Corn, Cattle, Provisions,
and several other Commodities, especially the Wednesdays before Christmas,
Easter, and Whitsuntide.

Ledbury; seated near the Malvern Hills, in a rich Clay Ground, is a well built
Town, and much inhabited by Clothiers, who drive a good Trade here.

Among the Things remarkable in this County, here is first, by Snod-hill
Castle, a Quarry of excellent Marble. And, by Richards Castle, in the North
Part of the County, a Well called Bone-Well, wherein are always found sinall
Fishes Bones, but not a Fin to be seen. Which Well being wholly cleansed of
them, yet will the like come again, and no Man knows whether they be produced
naturally, or brought thither in Veins through the Earth.

Neither can I omit to relate the Story of Marsley Hill, though I could scarce
give credit to it, were it not related both by Cambden and Speed, two
Authentic Authors. This Hill, in the Year 1571, removed it self with a roaring
noise from the place where it stood, and for 3 days together traveled from its
old Seat. It began this Motion on Saturday the 7th of February about 6 a Clock
at Night, and by 7 a Clock the next Morning it had gone about 200 Foot;
carrying with it Sheep in their Coats, Hedge-rows, and Trees, whereof some
stood, and others were overthrown. Kinnaston Chapel fell down in this Remove,
and two high Ways were turned about 300 Foot from their old Paths; the
East-Parts turned to the West, and the West turned to the East, Pasturage being
left in the place of Tillage, and Tillage on the other side overspreading the
Pasturage. Thus about 26 Acres of Ground traveled 3 days together, till being
raised to a Hill 12 fadoms high, there it rested.

This County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and its
Inhabitants known among the Romans by the Name of Silures) is now in the
Diocese of Hereford.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of
Parliament, Viz. 2 out of Hereford, 2 out of Lemster, and 2 out of Webley.

Huntingtonshire.
HVNTINGTONSHIRE, another Inland County, but of a small extent, is bounded on
the East by Cambridgeshire; on the North and West by Northamptonshire; and on
the South, by Bedfordshire.

It contains in Length about 22 Miles, and in Breadth 18. The Whole divided
into four Hundreds, wherein 79 Parishes, and 6 Market Towns.

In former time this County was very Woody, being counted a Forest, and such as
afforded excellent Game for Hunting, from whence it took its Denomination. But
in the beginning of the Reign of Henry II. it was disforested, being at present
a very open Country, and generally flat. Only in some Parts it rises into
little Hills, best for the Plough; as the Valleys are for Pasture, which is
counted as good here as any in England.

The East Part of it toward Cambridgeshire, is something troubled with Fens,
which makes the Air not so good here as in other Parts of England. Yet the
Natives that dwell about them are healthful, and many of 'em long-lived; but
it is not so with Strangers.

In general this Country is very fertile, both for Corn and Pasturage; and is
well watered with Rivers, the chief whereof is the Owse.

One Thing it is peculiar in, which is its plenty of Willows; from whence it is
nicknamed the Willow-shire.

Huntington, the chief Place of it, bears from London North by West, and is
distant from it 48 Miles, thus. From London to Edmonton 6; to Waltham-Cross 6
more; and 8 from thence to Ware; from Ware to Puckeridge, 4; to Royston, 9
more; and thence to Huntington 15.

The same is pleasantly seated on a soft Ascent, and on the North Banks of the
River Owse, over which it has a fair Stone Bridge, which leads to
Godmanchester. It is a Town of great Antiquity, and has formerly enjoyed great
Privileges. Once so large and populous as to contain 15 Parish-Churches, now
reduced to four. However it is still a Place of good Trade, well inhabited and
frequented, being a Thorough-fare Town for Travelers to and from the North.
Here is kept the County Goal, and the County Assizes. And its Market, which is
on Saturdays, is well served with Provisions. Of some Note besides for an
Abbey, founded here by Maud the Empress; and Eustace Loveloft; the Ruins of
which, and of a far more ancient Castle built by King Edward the Elder, are yet
to be seen.

This Town became an Earldom presently upon the Norman Conquest, the Title of
it enjoyed by several Families, before it came to George, Lord Hastings,
created Earl of Huntington by King Henry VIII. Anno 1529. From whom is
descended in a right Line the Right Honorable Theophilus Hastings, the present
Earl of Huntington.

The other Market Towns are St. Ives, Mund. Yaxley, Tue. Ramsey, Wedn. St.
Neots, Thu. and Kimbolton, Frid.


Among which St. Ives and St. Neots, two large and well built Towns, and of
good Antiquity, are seated on the Ouse, each of them with a fair Stone Bridge
over it. St. Ives so called from one Ivo, a Persian Bishop, who about the Year
600. traveled (as it is said) through England, preaching the Gospel, and here
ended his Days. Whose Body, in a short time after, was removed to Bamsey Abbey.
This Town is much resorted to for Cattle by London Butchers.

St. Neots, or St. Needs, from Neotus a Monk of Glastenbury. A Man no less holy
than learned, whose Body was translated hither from Neotstoke in Cornwall, and
in whose Honor Earl Elfrides Palace was converted into a Monastery. This Town
is beautified with a neat Church, and a fine Steeple to it.

A little beneath it, at a Place called Aileweston, are two Springs, the one
fresh, and the other brackish; the first good for dim Sights, the other for
curing of Scabs and Leprosy.

Kimbolton, a pretty fair Town, seated in the bottom near Bedfordshire, is of
chief note for giving the Title of Baron to the Earl of Manch^ster; whose
Mansion is called the Castle of Kimbolton.

Ramsey is seated in the Fens among rich Grounds, toward Cambridgeshire, near
the Meers of Ramsey and Whitlesey. Which, with the Rivers that plentifully
water it, afford excellent Fish, and wild Fowl in great plenty. A noted Place
in former time for its wonderful rich Abbey, which continued in its glory till
its Dissolution by King Henry VIII.

This County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and its
Inhabitants Part of the Iceni, as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocese
of Lincoln.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two
Parliament Men, and these out of Huntington.

Kent.
KENT, in Latin Cantium, so called as being seated in a Canton or Corner of the
Kingdom, is a large, rich, and pleasant Country ^^ying between the Thames and
the Narrow Seas. So that it is environed on all sides with the Sea, except
Westward, where it borders both upon Surrey and Sussex.

It contains in Length, from East to West, 60 Miles; in Breadth, from North to
South, 30. The Whole divided into five Lathes (called Sutton, Aylesford, Scray,
St. Augustine, and Shepway Lathes,) and these into 67 Hundreds; wherein 408
Parishes, and 30 Market Towns. Which is an Argument of its Populousness.

But the Air is neither so serene, nor so healthful here, as in other Counties,
especially near the Sea and Marshes; which makes this Country so noted for its
Kentish Agues. Now, that you may know in few words the Nature of this Country,
both as to its Air and Soil, I shall bring in the Remark made upon it, which
is, that there are 3 Ridges of Hills in Kent, one called Health without Wealth,
the second Health and Wealth, and the third Wealth without Health. Others, as
to the Soil, give this different Character of it. The Weald for Wood, East Kent
for Corn, Rumney for Meadow, Tenham for an Orchard, Shepey and Reculver for
Wheat, Thanet for Barley, and Hedcorn for Capons.

In general this may be said of Kent, that it is a Country very good for Corn,
and fit for Pasturage, according to the several Plots and Parts thereof; and
wondrous full of fruitful and well-ordered Orchards, from whence the City of
London is supplied with most sorts of Fruit, but chiefly with Pippins and
Cherries, which are counted the best in England. On the Cliffs between Deal and
Dover, there grows a great store of Samphire.

The same is well watered with Rivers. For, besides the Thames that washes its
North Parts, here is the Medway, which in a manner parts it in the middle, the
Stower that runs by Canterbury, the Tun through Tunbridge, and the Rother upon
which Appledore is seated, not to mention the lesser Streams.

Of all the Counties in England, this was the first Kingdom of the Heptarchy,
and had a particular King to it self, which no other County ever had. Neither
was it conquered by the Normans, the Kentish Men yielding upon Articles, and
having their ancient Franchises and Customs confirmed to 'em by William the
Conqueror. One of which is the Cavelkind, whereby they are not so bound by
Copyhold as in other Parts of England; Lands of this nature being equally
divided here among the male Children, and for want of Males, among the Females.
By the same Law they are at age at 15 years old, and they may sell or make over
the Land without the consent of the Lord. Also, the Son (tho of a convicted
Father for Felony or Murder) succeeds him in such Kind of Lands.

The Kentish Men besides have this to glory in, that they were the first
Christians of this Island. And this is the only County at this time that has
two Cities, or Episcopal Sees, namely Canterbury and Rochester.

Canterbury, the chief Place of this County, is 46 miles East of London, Viz.
from London to Dartford, 12; to Rochester, 11 more; from thence to Sittingborn,
10; and to Canterbury, 13 more.

A City of great Antiquity, if it was built (as some Authors aver) 900 years
before Christ. It Is seated on the River Stower, (noted for breeding the best
Trouts in the South East Parts of England,) and is counted in the Lath of S.
Augustine. The Buildings of it but mean, and the Wall which encompasses it, in
a decayed condition. The greatest Ornament of all is the Cathedral, wherein ly
interred the Bodies of eight Kings. For this City had been the Seat of the
Kings of Kent, till given by Ethelbert, the first Christian King of this
Country, to Augustine the first Archbishop thereof, and his Successors.
Whereupon the King removed his Seat to Reculver, a Town by the Seaside. In this
Cathedral is also interred the Body of Thomas Becket, once Archbishop hereof,
that famous Saint so reverenced by the Romanists. In this City, and its
Suburbs, are reckoned 14 Parish Churches; besides a Meeting Place under the
Cathedral, for the Walloon^ that dwell in this City, who are very numerous, and
drive a considerable Trade of the Stuffs they make here. It has two Markets a
Week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, the latter of which is the most considerable.

But to the honor this City has had of being the Regal Seat of the first Kings
of Kent, and of being to this day the Sea of the Primate of England, let us add
the Coronation of King John and Queen Izabel his Wife, the Marriages of Henry
II. and Edward I, and the Interments of Edward the black Prince, King Henry the
Fourth, and Queen Joan his Wife, all which was performed in this Place.

The other Market Towns are Eltham, Mund. Wrotham, Tue. Lenham. Tue. Westram,
Wedn. S. Mary Cray, Wedn. Goldburst, Wedn. Gravesend, Wedn. and Sat. Feversham,
Wedn. and Sat. Dover, Wedn. and Sat. Sandwich, Wedn. and Sat. Wye, Thu. Rumney,
Thu. Lyd, Thu. Folkstone, Thu. Maidstone, Thu. Bromley, Thu. Rochester, Frid.
Tunbridge, Frid. Tenderden, Frid. Woolwich, Frid. Smarden, Frid. Malinge, Sat.
Milton, Sat. Cranbrook, Sat. Hythe, Sat. Ashford, Sat. Sevenoke, Sat. Dartford,
Sat. Appledore, --


Among which Rockester requires the preeminence, as a Bishops See, and the
second for Antiquity in all the Island. It is seated upon the Medway, over
which it has a stately Stone Bridge, one of the fairest in England. It consists
most of one principal Street, which extends it self a long way; the Houses
being but ordinary, as they are inhabited for the most part but by Tradesmen
and Innkeepers. Yet, besides the Honor it has of being a Bishops See, it is
dignified with the Title of an Earldom in the Person of the Right Honorable
Laurence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, Viscount Hyde, etc. Which Title was formerly
enjoyed by three Wilmots; And, before them, there was a Viscount of this Place,
Sir Robert Carr being created Viscount of Rochester, Anno 1611. and afterward
Earl of Somerset.

Adjoining to this City is Chatham, also seated on the Banks of Medway. A long
Thoroughfare Town, well inhabited by Seamen and Shipwrights, as being the
principal Station of the Royal Navy, and having a good Dock and Storehouses,
for the building and equipping of his Majesty's Ships.

Maidstone is seated also on the Medway, but near the head of it. This is the
Town where the County-Goal, Sessions, and Assizes are kept; being conveniently
seated for that purpose, and a Place of good resort.

Gravesend is seated on a rising Hill on the Banks of the Thames. A Town of
great Refort for Travelers, both by Sea and Land, that either come up the
Thames to London, or go down the River in order to take Shipping; well
furnished therefore with Inns, and other Houses of Entertainment, but noted for
their exactings. Over against it, in Essex, is Tilbury-Fort, that commands this
Passage.

Nearer to London stands Dartford, on the River Darent, not far from its Influx
into the Thames; which gives good advantage to the Town, in conveying their
Goods to London. The Town is large; and, being in Dover Road, is therefore well
accommodated with Inns and Houses of Entertainment. Of chief note for the
Rebellion begun here, and headed by John Tiler, (commonly nicknamed
Jackstraw,) in the Reign of Richard the second, Anno 1381.

Woolwich, seated on the Thames, is remarkable for nothing but its Dock, used
for the Royal Navy.

But nearer to London stand Greenwich and Deptford, two Towns of better
account, tho they be no Market Towns. The first is pleasantly seated on the
Banks of the Thames, a neat and healthful Place, well inhabited and frequented
by Gentry. Adjoining to which is a Royal House, called Queen Elizabeth's
Palace, with a Park about it, yielding a fair Prospect. Besides another
Palace by the Rivers-side, first built by Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, and
after him enlarged and beautified by several Kings; till being fallen to ruin,
King Charles II. attempted to make it a stately Pile of Building, but left it
unfinished. Adjoining to Greenwich is Black Heath, noted for the Battles fought
here against Rebels, under the Reigns of Richard II. Henry VI. and Henry VII.

Deptford is another large Town, divided into the Upper and the Lower; seated
the nearest to Surrey, at the very fall of the Ravensburn (a small River) into
the Thames, among rich and low Meadows. A Town well inhabited and frequented by
Seamen, by reason of its Docks and Storehouses for the Navy Royal.

Bromley stands upon the same River; graced with the Bishop of Rochester's Seat
(a Country House) by it. One of whose late Predecessors, I mean Dr. Warner,
founded here a College for 20 Clergy-mens Widows. Where each one has a fair
Apartment, and 20 l. a Year Rentcharge duly paid; and, for their public
Devotion, a Chaplain, provided with fair Lodgings, and 50 l. a Year Rentcharge.

Eltham, seated on the South Side of Shooters^hill, among Woods, is a neat
Town, and well inhabited by Gentry. Formerly honored with ^ Royal Palace, but
laid aside and gone to decay, since Greenwich came to be looked upon (as indeed
it is) a Place of greater Delight.

Near Westram, on the Darent, stands Otford, on or near the same River, a place
of good Antiquity. Noted for the Battle sought here betwixt King Edmund
surnamed Ironside, and Canute the Dane, wherein Canute was put to flight, with
the Loss of 5000 Danes.

S. Mary Cray is so called from Cray, a small (but swift) River, on which it is
situate in a Wood-land Country. Its Market is very inconsiderable.

Sevenoke, not far distant from thence, is a Town of good Resort. Here is an
Hospital, and a Free School, founded by one William Sevenoke, Lord Mayor of
London, Anno 1418. who was a Foundling in this Town, and from hence took his
Name.

Tunbridge, so called from the River Tun upon which it is seated, within few
miles of its fall into the Medway, is a noted place for its mineral Waters, so
much resorted unto by the Gentry, and drunk in the Summer-Season. Known by the
Name of Tunbridge-Wells, though at some distance from thence, at a Place called
Speldherst.

Cranbrook is seated at the very head of the River Medway, and Lenham at the
Spring of the Stower. Upon which last River you will find also both Ashford and
Wye. And, upon the Rother, Appledore, an Island called Oxney-Isle.

This Island is seated in the South-West Parts of Kent, toward Sussex;
encompassed with the River Rother, and a lesser River that runs into it. It has
but 3 Towns in it, Wittrisham, Stonae, and Ebony, all three but inconsiderable.

North-Eastward, near the Isle of Shepey, lie Milton and Feversham; the first a
Place of good account in the Reign of Edward the Confessor, but Feversham the
best trading Place at this time. For it has the Convenience of a Creek that
comes up to it, which makes it the chief Port-Town for all this Part of Kent,
being well frequented by Hoys, and such like small Vessels. The Town is large,
and well inhabited; and its Markets well served with Provisions. But it is
counted an Aguish Place. Here was erected an Abbey by King Stephen where
himself, his Queen, and Eustace his Son were buried. Of late years it has been
dignified with the Title of an Earldom, in the Person of the Right Honorable
Lewis de Duras, Earl of Feversham, etc. And, since that, it has made a greater
Noise in the World, on the account of the late King's landing there Incognito,
in the first Attempt he made to withdraw himself into France.

Not far from this Town are Pits of a great depth, narrow at the mouth, and
very broad below; with several distinct Rooms in 'em and Pillars of Chalk, as
it were to support, them.

Whitstable and Reculver are two Sea-Towns, few Miles North of Canterbury, well
frequented by Hoymen and Fishermen. Reculver, of special note, for that
Ethelbert, the first Christian King of Kent, had his Palace, and did reside
here. Its Church remarkable for its lofty spired Steeple, which serves for a
Sea-Mark.

I come now to the Cinque-Port Towns that belong to this County, Those are
called CinqueForts, which lying on the Coast of Kent and Sussex had great
Privileges granted them by former Kings, the better to enable 'em to seture
these Coasts against the Encroachments of France. They were at first but five,
as is ^mply'd by the Word, which is originally French. But three more were
added to 'em, which makes up the Number of eight. Whereof four are in this
County, Viz. Dover, Sand^ich, Hythe, and N^w Rumney; the others in Sussex, to
wit, Rye, Winchelsey, Seaford, and Hastings. And of these in their proper place.

Dover, the principal of 'em, stands over against Calais in France; the Passage
by Sea being reckoned but 7 Leagues (or 21 Miles) over. Seated it is in the
very South-East Point of Kent, in a Bottom among Cliffs, from whence one may
easily discern the Coast of France. Upon one of those Cliffs stands the Castle,
both to command and defend the Town, which some will have to be built by Julius
Caesar. A Castle of that importance, that Philip King of France, when Lewis his
Son (being called in hither by the factious Barons against King John) had
gotten many Towns and Forts, without being able to get the mastery of this,
slighted all that was taken, and said his Son had not one Foot of Land in
England, if he were not Master of Dover-Castle. As to the Buildings of this
Town, they are but mean; though it be in Time of Peace the greatest Thorow-fare
for Travelers from England to France, and from that Kingdom to this. It has
formerly had (...) Parish-Churches, which are now reduced to two. Its Haven is
indifferent good, and (as Calais on the other side of the Water) fit only for
smaller Vessels. As for honourary Titles, I don't find any it has yielded
before the Reign of King Charles I, by whom Henry Carey, Viscount Rochford, and
Baron Hunsden, was created Earl of Dover, Anno 1627. Which Title expired with
his Son John Carey, dying without Issue-male in the Year 1667; the Barony
continuing in the Collateral Line.

Sandwich lies about 12 miles North from Dover, and was formerly a Place of
good Strength. But, since the Sea has forsaken it, and its Haven has been
choakt up, it has los^ much of its Trade and Reputation. Noted however for
giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable Edward Montague, the present
Earl of Sandwich. Devolved to him from his Father, Edward Montague, created
Baron Montague of S. Neots, Viscount Hinchingbroo^ and Earl of Sandwich, by
King Charles II 1660. Who lost his Life in a Sea Fight against the Dutch, May
29. 1672.

Hythe, another of the Cinque-Port Towns has run the same fate as Sandwich, by
the unkindness of the Sea. It lies South and by Wes^ from Dover, within a Mile
of Sangate Cade.

Rumney is seated in a Marsh so called, about 14 Miles long, and 8 broad. Much
more famous for the Convenience of the Marsh in the Grazing of Cattle, than
either for good Air or a good Harbor.

To the Port of Dover belongs Folkstone, as a Member thereof; a Sea-Town near
Sangate Castle, formerly containing 5 Parish Churches, now reduced to one.

Lyd is likewise a Member of the Cinque Ports. And so are Deal and Fordwich,
Members of the Town and Port of Sandwich. The first of which is of most note in
these Parts for the Fleets that from time to time harbor ^ereabouts, in order
to sail East or West.

The Kentish Isles, Thanet and Shepey.
In the North-East Parts of Kent, near ^andwich, is an Island called Thanet,
surrounded on all sides with the Sea, except Westward, where it is severed from
the main Land by the River Stoure, here called Yenlade; but so, that, by the
benefit of a Causey and Passage for the Waters in convenient Places, it is
united to the Continent (or main Land) of Kent. This Island called by the
Saxons Thanet, from Thanatos, or Athanatos, by which Name it is found in
Solinus, is about 9 Miles in length, and 8 in breadth at the broadest.

An Island plentifully stored with Provisions, but Corn especially; and withal
very populous. Famous for being the Place which the Saxons landed at, when they
first came into Britain; the first Livery and Seisin which they had of the
whole Kingdom, conferred by the improvident Bounty of Vortiger, to whose Aid
they were called in. And no less remarkable for being the Landing Place of
Augustine the Monk, when he brought the Gospel to the victorious Heathen
Saxons, and by his Preaching subjected them to the Rules of Christianity.

At Stonar, a Port Town of this Island, is the Sepulcher (says Heylin) of
Vortimer, King of the Britains. Who, having vanquished the Saxons in many
Battles, and finally driven them out of the Island, desired to be here
interred, on a fond conceit that his dead Corpse would fright them from Landing
any more upon these Goasts. Which he did probably in imitation of that Scipio,
who having had a fortunate Hand against those of Carthage, gave order that his
Tomb should be turned toward Africa, to fright the Carthaginians from the
Coasts of Italy. But the Britains found at last by sad experience, the
difference there is betwixt a King in the Field and a King in the Grave.

On the North Shore of this Island is a Point of Land, of special note among
Mariners, by the Name of North Foreland. And the whole Isle in general is noted
for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable Thomas Tufton, the present
Earl of Thanet.

Shepey is another Island, much about the bigness of the former. Surrounded on
all sides with the Sea, except Southward, where it is parted by the Medway from
the main Land of Kent. This is likewise a very fruitful Island, winch from the
great Flocks of Sheep that feed here, came perhaps to be called Shepey. It Is
well watered with Rivers, especially the South Parts of it. And the Soil of it
has a peculiar quality, in not breeding of Moles. This Island has been much
harassed by the Danes, and by the Followers of Earl Goodwin and his Sons. At
present it gives the Title of Countess to the Lady Elizabeth, Countess of
Shepey, Lady Dacres, etc. The chief Place is Queenborough, which stands on the
West Coast. Besides which here are several other Towns, as Minster,
East-Church, Warden, Leysden, Elmley, etc.

West from this Island is another of a small Compass, on which stands the Fort
called Sheerness, which commands the Mouth of the Thames and Medway.

To conclude, as to the County of Kent, it stands now divided between the
Diocese of Canterbury and Rochester, and was (as I said before) a Kingdom of it
self in the Time of the Heptarchy. Called Cantium and the Inhabitants Cantii,
by the Romans.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 16 Members of
Parliament. Viz. Two out of each of these Towns, Canterbury, Rochester,
Maidstone, and Queenborough; besides these Cinque-Port Towns, Sandwich, Dover,
Hythe, and New-Rumney.

It has been for several Ages dignified with the Title of an Earldom, that is,
ever since the Entrance of the Normans, but not without several Interruptions.
Till upon the Death of William Nevil, Earl thereof, the Title was conferred by
King Edward IV. upon Edmund Gray, Lord Ruthen, Created Earl of Kent Anno 1465.
From whom is descended the Right Honorable Anthony Gray, the present Earl of
Kent, Grandchild of Anthony Gray Clerk, Parson of Burbage in the County of
Leicester. Who, upon the Death of Henry Gray, without Issue Male, Anno 1639.
was advanced to this Title, as the next Heir to it, being Grandchild of
Anthony, third Son of George Gray, the Son of Edmund aforesaid.

Lastly, to those several Things Remarkable in this County, which I brought in
occasionally, I shall only add, That at Egerton is a Spring, whose Water turns
Wood into Stone. And at Boxley-Abbey another Spring of the same nature, the
Water whereof will turn in 9 days time Sticks and small Wood into Stone.

CHAP. XI.
Of Lancashire, Leicester, and Lincolnshire.

Lancashire.
LANCASHIRE, or the County Palatine of Lancaster, is a large Maritim^ County,
in the North-West Parts o^ England. Founded on the East with York shire, and
part of Derbyshire; on the Wes^ by the Irish Sea; on the North, by Cumberlan^
and Westmorland; and on the South, by Ch^shire.

Its Length, from North to South, is 57 miles its Breadth, from East to West,
32. The Who^ divided into six Hundreds, wherein 61 Parishe^ and 26
Market Towns. The Number of Parish^ but small, in so large a quantity of
Ground; but that there are many Chapels of Ease, equal to Parishes elsewhere
for Multitudes of People.

Here the Air is sharp, thin, and piercing, seldom troubled with Fogs. And the
Inhabitants accordingly are healthful, comely, strong, and long-lived, not
subject to many Diseases.

The Soil differs much, according to its different nature and situation; some
Parts being Mountainous, and of the Champain Country some very fruitful, some
Mossy, and the rest Moorish.

The Champain Country is very good for Wheat and Barley; but that which lies at
the bottom of the Hills is best for Oats.

From the Mosses, which are not unlike the Irish Bogs, some of them many Miles
in Compass, the common People get Turves for their Firing. And sometimes they
dig up Trees out of them, which serve both for Building and Fuel. Cambden
seems to be of Opinion, that they are subterraneous Trees growing under Ground,
as some other Plants do.

The Mountainous Part, which lies Eastward, is full of stony, craggy, and
barren Hills, bare of Wood, and the Habitation of Foxes, Conies, Otters, etc.
Amongst these Hills, some are of a prodigious height; especially Pendle-Hill,
on the top whereof grow's a peculiar Plant called Cloudsberry, as coming from
the Clouds. But one thing besides is remarkable in this Hill, that, whenever
the Top of it is covered with a Mist, it is an infallible Sign of Rain.

The Country in general is well watered with Rivers; the chief whereof are the
Mersey, the Rible, and the Lon, all three running from East to West into the
Irish Sea. The Mersey Waters the South Parts, and serves for a Boundary betwixt
this County and Cheshire; the Rible waters the middle; and the Lon, the North
Parts.

Besides these Rivers, and many others of less note, here are several great
Meers (or Lakes,) as Merton, and Winder (or Wimander) Mere. This last divides
part of Lancashire from Westmorland, reaching about 10 miles in length, and 3
or 4 in breadth. It has (as most Lakes in the North) a clear pebbly Bottom,
whence the Saying, that this Lake is all paved with Stone. And it breeds great
store of Fish, particularly Trouts, Pikes, Pearches, Eels, and Skellies. But
there is one sort of Fish peculiar to it, and not to be found elsewhere, except
in Vlles Water, another Lake, bordering both upon Cumberland and Westmorland.
Charre is the Name of it, and it is a dainty Fish, whereof many Pies are yearly
sent abroad for Presents.

In short, though this Country in general cannot be called a fruitful Country,
yet what is good of it yields abundance of good Grass and Corn, the fairest
Oxen in England, and in general all sorts of Provisions. Fish and Fowl
particularly here is great plenty of; and in the River Lon, near Cockerfand
Abbey, is great store of Salmon.

To make Linen, here grows a great deal of Flax; for Fuel the Country yields,
not only fat Earth, but good Coals; and for Building, Quarries of good Stone.

Lancaster, the Sh^re Town, bears from London North-West and by North, and is
distant therefrom (by common computation) 187 miles, thus. From London to
Stafford, 104, for the particulars whereof I refer you to Staffordshire. Then
from Stafford to Stone, 10; to Newcastle, 6 more; thence to Warington, 20; to
Wigan, 14 more; to Preston, 14 more; then to Garstang, 10; and to Lancaster, 15
more.

A Town pleasantly seated, in a good Soil, on the South Side of the ^iver Lon,
near its fall into the Sea. From which River it came to be called Loncaster,
since turned into Lancaster, as from Lancaster the whole County took the Name
of Lancashire. The Town not very well peopled, nor much frequented. There are
in it several fair and long Streets, from the Length whereof this Town (I
suppose) might be called Longovicus by the Emperor Antonine. And yet there is
but one Parish Church, which indeed is large and fair. It stands on the side of
a Hill; on the top of which is the Castle, now made use of for the County Goal
both for Debtors and Malefactors, and for keeping the Assizes for the County.
Besides the Church and Castle, two of the chief Ornaments of this Town, here is
a fair Stone Bridge over the Lon, supported by five Arches. To which add the
Market-house, or Town Hall, where the Mayor and his Brethren keep their Courts.
Its Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is commonly well furnished with all
sorts of Provisions, but Fish (and among the rest, Salmon,) especially.

Lastly, this Town is of sufficient Fame in the Annals of England, for those
noble Persons which have successively born the Titles of Earls and Dukes of it;
the greatest Princes in their time, for Revenues, of any Subjects in
Christendom. Of which House there have been four Kings of England, all under
the Name of Henry, viz. Henry the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, and the
seventh. The last, by marrying with Elizabeth, Daughter and Heir to Edward IV.
of the House of York, did happily unite the two Houses of York and Lancaster;
Whose Competition for the Crown of England, under the Names of Red and White
Roses, had caused more Bloodshed than the Conquest of France by the English.

The Market Towns of this County, besides Lancaster, are Manchester, Sat.
Leverpool, Sat. Clitheroe, Sat. Dalton, Sat. Blackborn, Mund. Poulton, Mund.
Cartmill, Mund. Hornby, Mund. Hawkshead, Mund. Wigan, Mund. and Frid. Rochdale,
Tue. Chorley, Tue. Ormskirk, Tue. Kirkham, Tue. Prescot, Tue. Coln, Wedn.
Haslington, Wedn. Warington, Wedn. Preston, Wedn. Frid. Sat. Bury. Thu.
Garstang, Thu. Vlverston Thu.


Besides Leigh, and ^reat Eccleston, whose Market-days I am ignorant of.

Manchester, is seated upon a stony Hill in the South-East Parts of the County,
between the Rivers Irk and Irwell, both which empty themselves, not far off
into the Mersey. This Town, called by Antonine the Emperor Mantunium, was a
Station of the Romans. And it is to this day a Town much beyond Lancaster, in
beauty, and populousness. Its chief Ornaments are the College, and the
Marketplace; but, above all, the Collegiate Church, beautified with a small
Quire of excellent Workmanship. Honored besides with the Title of an Earldom,
in the person of the Right Honorable Charles Montague, the present Earl of
Manchester; derived to him from his great Grandfather Henry Montague, Viscount
Mandeville, created Earl of Manchester by King Charles I. Anno 1625. being then
Lord Treasurer, and President of the Council, and afterward Lord Privy Seal.

And lastly, it is a noted Place for its Linen and Woollen Cloths; as also for
its Cottons, which are held in great esteem.

Leverpool is the next Place of chief note in this County. It Is an excellent
Seaport, commodiously seated at the fall of the River Mersey into the Sea,
where it affords a safe Harbor for Ships, and a convenient Passage into
Ireland. To the immortal Praise of the Family of the Mores of Banck-hall, this
Town has been very much improved and beautified, at their Charge and Industry.
Here is a Townhouse erected upon Pillars and Arches of hewn Stone, and
underneath an Exchange for the Merchants. Among its Antiquities, a Castle on
the South Side, which commands the Pool, built by King John, during his stay
here for a Wind to Ireland; and on the West Side, upon the River, the Tower,
being a stately and strong Pile of Building.

Preston, near to Leverpool, is a fair, large, well inhabited and frequented
Borough-Town. Seated on the North-side of the Rible, over which it has a very
fair Stone Bridge. In this Town are held the Court of Chancery, and Offices of
Justice for Lancaster, as a County Palatine.

Not far from Preston aforesaid is a small Town, from the River on which it is
situate, called Rible-Chester, which has been esteemed and called the richest
Town in Christendom. No doubt but it has been a Place of great account in the
Time of the Romans, if we consider the many Statues, pieces of Coin, Altars,
Pillars, Inscriptions, and other Pieces of Antiquity, that have been often
dug up here.

Wigan is another Town of note in this Country. Seated on the River Dowles, and
much inhabited by Braziers, Pewterers, Diers, Weavers of Rugs, Coverlets, and
Tackling for Bedding. Of special note for the choicest Coal in England, called
Caunel; but most of all for a burning Well, not far from it.

Warington, a good large Town, is seated on the River Mersey, over which
there is a fine Stone Bridge, which leads to Cheshire. Dignified of late with
the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the Right Honorable Henry Booth,
Earl of Warington, and Baron De la Mere.

Poulton, Bury, and Rochdale, lie not far asunder; the first on the Irwell, and
Rochdale on the River Rock, in a Vale.

Coln is situate on a little Hill, near the Eastern Confines of the-County;
Blackborn, near the Derwent; Ormskirk, not far from Merton Mere; Ki^kham, near
the Mouth of the Rible; Garstang, near the Wire; and Hornby, on the Lon. This
last noted for its Castle, called Hornby-Castle, the ancient Seat of the Lord
Morley and Mounteagle.

Hawkshead is placed in a hilly and woody Country; Clitheroe, toward
Pendle-hill; Dalton, in a Champain Country, not far from the Sea; and
Vlverston, commonly called Ouslon, on a small Stream, which empties it self not
far off into the Sea, or an Arm thereof, near Lever-Sand.

Lastly, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of Northumberland, and its
Inhabitants part of the Brigantes, as the Romans called them) is now in the
Diocese of Lincoln.

It was made a County Palatine by King Edward the Third. And out of it are
elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 12 Members of Parliament, Viz.
two out of each of these Towns, Lancaster, Leverpool, Preston, Wigan,
Clitheroe, and, Newton.

Leicestershire.
LEICESTERSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded on the East by the Counties of
Lincoln and Rutland; on the West, by Warwickshire; Northward, by Derbyshire and
Nottinghamshire; and Southward, by Northamptonshire.

Its Length, from East to West, is about 30 miles; its Breadth, from North to
South, about 25. The whole divided into six Hundreds, wherein 192 Parishes, and
12 Market Towns.

The Air in this County is mild and wholesome; and the Inhabitants accordingly
are healthy, and long-lived.

The Soil, in the South-East parts especially, is extreme fertile for all sorts
of Grain, but chiefly Peace and Beans; and has also rich Pastures, feeding
Cattle and Sheep in great Numbers, whose Wool for its fineness is had in great
esteem. But the North-West part is generally barren, and in some places rocky
and stony. About the Forest of Charwood (where is Bardon-Hill) is great store
of Limestone, wherewith they manure their Ground.

For Fuel, this Country is but thinly clothed with Wood, especially in the
South-East Parts. But this Defect is sufficiently supplied by the great plenty
of Pit-coal dug up in the North Parts.

Here are a great many small Rivers, but none of any long Course, besides the
Stower and the Wreak.

Leicester, the County Town, bears from London North-North-West, and is distant
therefrom 78 miles, thus. Viz. from London to Northampton 54, for the
particulars of which I refer you to Northamptonshire; from Northampton to
Harborough, 12, and from thence to Leicester, 12 more.

It is pleasantly seated in a good Air, and rich Soil, on the Banks of the
Stower (of old called Leir) that washes its North and West Parts, and over
which it has two Bridges. Once a Bishops See, and in those Days. beautified
with a fair Collegiate Church, a magnificent Abbey, and a strong Castle, all
decayed and ruined by the iniquity and injury of the Times. As to the present
State of it, it is indifferent large, containing 3 Parish Churches, has several
good Buildings, and is well inhabited. In short, it is in as good plight, both
for Trade and Buildings, as most Towns are that want a navigable River. And its
Market, which is on Saturdays, is well served with Provisions, and Country
Commodities.

Noted besides for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable Philip
Sidney, the present Earl of Leicester. Derived to him from his Father Robert,
Son and Heir of Robert Sidney, Viscount Lisle, created Earl of Leicester, and
Baron of Penthurst, by King James the first, Anno 1618. Which Robert was
descended of a Sister of Robert Dudley, the last of many Earls of Leicester
before him.

The other Market Towns are Ashby, Sat. Hinkley, Mund. Mont-Sorel, Mund.
Melton-Mowbray Tue. Harborough Tue. Bosworth, Wedn. Loughborow, Thu. Waltham,
Thu. Hallaton, Thu. Lutterworth, Thu. Billesden, Frid.


Among which Ashby, or Ashby de la Zouche, is seated between two Parks, on the
Borders of Derbyshire. In whose Neighborhood is Cole. Overton, noted for its
Pit-coals. Hinkley stands on the Borders of Warwickshire; beautified with a
fair and large Church, and a lofty Spire-Steeple.

Mont-Sorrel is seated on a great Eminency, near the Stowr, over which it has a
Bridge. Of some note formerly for its famous Castle, that stood on a steep and
craggy Hill, but is long since demolished. At Barrow, near adjoining, is dug
up excellent Lime, much commended for its binding.

Melton-Mowbray is situate in a fertile Soil, on the banks of the Wreak, over
which it has two Stone-bridges. Harborough, on the Borders of Northamptonshire,
and the banks of the Weland, which parts the two Counties.

Bosworth is loftily seated on a Hill, and in a fertile Soil. Noted for the
bloody Battle fought at Redmore, near adjoining, betwixt Richard III. and his
Successor Henry VII. Which decided the long-depending Differences betwixt the
Houses of York and Lancaster, giving the Crown from Richard to Henry, descended
from the latter House. Richard being slain in this Battle, his Body was
ignominiously cast cross a Horse's back, naked and torn in pieces, and meanly
buried in the Grey-Friars of Leicester. Which being afterward destroyed, the
Stone-Chest wherein the Corpse lay, serves now in an Inn for a drinking Trough
for Horses.

Loughborow, a good handsome Town, flands pleasantly, among fertile Meadows,
near the Forest of Charwood, on the Banks of the River Stowr, over which it has
a Bridge. Lutterworth, a goodly Town also, beautified with a large and fair
Church, with a neat and lofty Spire-Steeple, is seated in a good Soil, on the
River Swift, which at a small distance from hence, falls into the Avon in
Warwickshire. Of this Town the famous Wicless was Parson, an okl Champion
against the Corruptions and Errors of the Church of Rome.

This County (now in the Diocese of Lincoln) was part of the ancient Kingdom of
Mercia, in the Time of the Heptarchy; and its Inhabitants (with several of
their Neighbors) went, among the ancient Romans, under the Name of Coritani.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members
of Parliament, chosen by the Town of Leicester.

Lincolnshire.
LINCOLNSHIRE, a large Maritime County, is bounded on the East with the German
Ocean; on the West, with the Counties of York, Nottingham, and Leicester; on
the North, with the River Humber, which parts it from Yorkshire; on the South,
with the Counties of Cambridge, Northampton, and Rutland.

It contains in Length, from North to South, almost 60 miles; in Breadth, from
East to West, 35. The Whole divided into 3 Parts, called Lindsey, Kesteven, and
Holland. And these 3 Divisions contain 30 Hundreds, wherein 630 Parishes, and
35 Market Towns.

This Country being Fenny, especially in the East and South Parts, makes the
Air something unhealthful, because it is apt to be thick and foggy.

The Soil, in the North and West Parts, is exceeding pleasant and fertile,
stored with Pasturage, Arable, and Meadow Grounds. But the East and South
Parts, that are full of Fenny Grounds, and something brackish by reason of the
Salt Waters that come in from the Sea through several Inlets, are barren, and
unfit for Corn. It Is true, in recompense thereof, there is such a plenty both
of Fowl and Fish, that no County in the Kingdom can compare with it. And there
goes a Story, that at one draught with a Net 30^0 Mallards have been taken,
besides other sorts. How true it is, I am as yet to seek; but am apt to think,
there is one Cipher too much.

As for Rivers, no County in England is better irrigated, nor Rivers any where
more plentiful of Fish. Northward is the Humber, which (as I said before)
parts it from Yorkshire; and Westward the Trent, which severs Part of it from
Nottinghamshire. Cross the Country you will find the Witham River; Southward,
the Weland, and the Nen.

That Part of the County which goes by the Name of Lindsey lies to the
Northward, and is so named from Lindissi, the ancient Name of Lincoln,
according to Beda. This Part is so surrounded with Water, that it is an Island;
and its Extent so great, in proportion to the rest, that it takes up at least
one half of the County. Noted for giving the Title of Earl to the Right
Honorable Robert Bertie, the present Earl of Lindsey, Lord Great Chamberlain
of England. Kesteven, and Holland take up the South Parts from Lindsey, Holland
lying toward the Sea, and Kesteven West from it. Of Holland there has been 3
Earls, Henry, Robert, and Edward Rich. The first, created Earl of Holland by
King James I. Anno 1624. Robert, his Son, succeeded not only in this Title, but
also in that of Earl of Warwick, upon the Death of his Cousingerman, Charles
Rich, Earl of Warwick, who died without Issue. So that both Titles are now
injoyd by his Son and Heir, the Right Honorable Edward Rich, the present Earl
of Warwick and Holland.

Lincoln, the principal Place in this Shire, and a Bishops See, bears from
London North by West, and is distant from it (by common Computation) 103 miles,
thus. Viz. from London to Huntington, 48 miles, for the Particulars whereof I
refer you to Huntingtonshire; from thence to Stilton, 9; to Peterborough 5
more; to Market-Deeping, 8; to Sleaford, 18 more; and thence to Lincoln, 15.

A City seated on the side of a Hill, the lower part whereof is watered by the
River Witham; over which there are several Bridges, for the Convenience of
Passengers. A Place of great Antiquity, whose ancient ruinated Places are still
an Argument of its former Greatness. In the Time of the Romans 'twas a Town of
great strength and fame; and, in the Time of the Normans a Place of great
Trading. Whose flourishing Condition occasioned the Episcopal See, then at
Dorchester near Oxon, to be removed hither. But this City has gone through all
the Calamities of Fire, Sword, and Earthquake. Which has so much weakened and
impaired it, that of 50 Churches it is said to have had for divine Worship,
there remains but 15, besides the Cathedral.

In the Time of the Saxons, King Arthur drove away their Forces from this
Place. The like did Edmund Ironside to the Danes, who had made sore havoc
thereof. On the 5th of Sept. 1140. here was a great Battle fought between King
Stephen and Maud the Empress, in which the King was taken Prisoner, and
afterward laid in irons in Bristol. On the 19th of May 1217. here was another
sore Battle fought betwixt King Henry III. and his disloyal Barons, who stood
for Lewis the Dauphin of France; in which the King got the day.

But, whatever Disasters and Calamities this City has gone through, still it is
a large, populous, and well frequented Place. Dignified not only with an
Episcopal See, whose Diocese to this day is the greatest of any in the Kingdom;
but also for many Ages, with the Title of an Earldom. Which, having passed
through several Families, with frequent Interruptions, came at last to be in
the possession of Edward Fiennes, Lord Clinton, who being Lord Admiral in Queen
Elizabeth's Time, was by her Majesty created Earl of Lincoln, Anno 1565. From
whom the Title is now devolved, in a direct Line, to the Right Honorable
Edward Clinton, the present Earl of Lincoln.

The Cathedral, or Minster, as now standing, is one of the stateliest Piles in
England, and perhaps in Christendom; high seated on a Hill, and from thence
discerned over all the Country. In short, this City is a County of it self,
whose Liberties extend about 20 miles in compass; and is called the County of
the City of Lincoln. Its Market kept on Fridays, is well served with
Provisions, and Country Commodities.

The other Market Towns are Grantham, Sat. Kirkton, Sat. Thongcaster, Sat.
Waynfleet, Sat. Horn-Castle, Sat. Dunington, Sat. Burton, Sat. Bourn, Sat.
Spilsby, Mun. Salsby, Mun. Sleaford, Mun. Market-Stanton, Mun. Stamford, Mund.
and Frid. Ganesborough, Tue. Barton, Tue. Market-Rasen, Tue. Bullingbrook, Tue.
Spalding, Tue. Alford, Tue. Grinsby, Wedn. Binbrook, Wedn. Lowthe, Wed. and
Sat. Boston, Wed. and Sat. Glamford, Thu. Burgh, Thu. Market-Deeping, Thu.
Folkingham, Thu. Holbich, Thu. Wragby, Thu. Naverby, Thu. Tatershall, Frid.
Saltfleet, Crowland, Barnwell,


Among which Stamferd in Kesteven Division, and the hithermost Town of
Lincolnshire, is the most considerable. Seated on both sides of the River
Weland, so that it stands upon three Counties; the chief Part in Lincoln^hire,
another part in Rutland, and that Part on this side the River in
Northamptonshire. Over which River, some time since made narigable, it has
several Bridges. A Town of good Antiquity, from whence the Roman Highway, or
high Dike, leads to the North. ^ut that which gives it most Renown is that,
upon a Quarrel between the North ^^d South-Men in the University of Oxford, ^he
Scholars removed hither in the Reign of Edward III, and here held public
Schools of ^ll sorts of Learning. Nor did they return ^gain, till they were
commanded so to do by ^he King's Proclamation, with Order that the Scholars, in
taking their Degrees, should make ^ath not to read publicly at Stamford, to
^he prejudice of Oxford. Nevertheless the Town still flourished in Trade and
Merchan^ize; and the Inhabitants of it to this day ^rive a good Trade, of Malt
especially, where^f great plenty is made here. The Houses ^re built of free
Stone, which they have from Ketton Quarry. In short, this Town ^onsists of
several Streets, begirt with a Wall, and containing six Parish Churches.
Dig^ify'd besides with the Title of an Earldom, ^ow in the person of the Right
Honorable Thomas Gray of Groby, Earl of Stamford, ^c. Within half a mile of
this Town, in ^orthamptonshire, stands Burgley House, (...) stately Building,
the Mansion House of the Earl of Exeter.

Grantham, situate on the River Witham, is a Town of good account, and well
resorted unto. Whose Church-Steeple is so very high, that it seems crooked to
the Eye of the Beholder.

Not far from hence, toward Leicestershire, is Belvoir Castle, the Earl of
Rutland's Seat, so highly elevated (though in a Vale) that it yields a most
admirable Prospect. About this Castle is found the Astroit, or Starlike Stone,
pointed with five beams or rays; formerly of such an esteem, that he thought
the Victory infallible on his side that wore one about him.

Sleaford stands near the head of a River so called, which runs into the
Witham. A large and well inhabited Town, formerly strengthened with a Castle,
whose ruinous Walls are yet standing.

Market-Deeping is seated not far from Stamford, on the Weland, but in a fenny
Ground. Where Richard de Rulos, Chamberlain to William the Conqueror, for the
hindering it Overflowing, raised its Banks, and built there on diverse
Tenements; so that it became a great Village, and is now an indifferent Town.

Bourn, seated at the head of a Spring calle^ Burnwell-head, is a goodly Town,
of some not for being the Place where King Edmund wa^ crowned. Here are still
to be seen the Rui^ of a good Castle. And, not far from hence is
Swinsted-Abbey, one of whose Monks (n^med Simon) poisoned King John.

Ganesborough, or Gainsborough, in Lindse^ Part, is seated on the River Trent.
A larg^ and well built Town, of a considerable Trade* Where Sueno, the Danish
Tyrant, was stabbe^ to death by an unknown hand, as a just Re^^ard for his many
Outrages committed in the ^ountry. Noted besides for giving the Title ^f Earl
to the Right Honorable Wriothesly Noel, the present Earl of Gainsborough.

Barton is seated on the River Humber, al^ost over against Hull in Yorkshire.
Here (...) a considerable Ferry into Yorkshire, which ^s no small Advantage to
the Town.

About this Place are abundance of Pewets, Godwits, Knots, and Dotterels; the
last a simple kind of Bird, yet much given to Imita^ing. And it is usually
caught by Candle^ight in this manner. The Fowler stands before the Bird; and if
he put out an Arm, ^he Bird stretches out a Wing; if he put a ^eg or his Head
forward, the Bird does the ^ike. Thus he imitates the Fowler's Gesture ^o long,
till he drawing nearer and nearer by degrees, at length casts his Net over him,
and takes him.

Grimsby, is situate within half a Mile of the Humber, where it falls into the
Sea, in a flat and marshy Ground. This Town has formerly enjoyed a good Trade,
before its Haven was choackt up; and then it had two Markets a Week. For the
security of its Port, it had a Castle, which is likewise decayed. And, instead
of two Churches it had, now it contents it self with one, which for largeness
gives place to few. Cathedrals.

Burton, or Burton Stather, is seated on the River Trent, near its fall into
the Humber.

On the other side of the Trent is the Isle of Axholm, made so by the Trent and
Dun, with two or three lesser Rivers. This Isle is in breadth from North to
South 10 miles, but in length not half so much; and in that Circuit are seated
several Towns. The lower Part of it is flat and moorish, yielding a sweet Shrub
called by the Country people Gall. But the middle Part, which is a rising
Ground, is fertile, and (among other Things) does yield great store of Flax.
Here is also Alabaster to be found.

Thongcaster, a well-compacted Town stands o^ the side of a Hill. Of note for
its ancien^ Castle so called, said to be built by Hengist the Saxon, after he
had beaten the Picts and Scots in Vortiger's Quarrel. Who granted him so much
Ground as an Ox-hide cut into Thongs would compass, within which he erected the
Castle.

Saltfleet is a Sea-Town, much frequented by the Gentry in the Summer Season
for the eating of Fish; otherwise inconsiderable.

Alford, a goodly Town, is seated at the head of a Rivulet, few miles from the
Seaside.

Waynfleet, South of Alford, is another good Town, not far from the Sea; but
seated in a fenny Ground, on a Wash (or Dike) which falls into the Sea. Here is
an excellent Fre^ School, founded by William of Waynfleet, Bishop of Winton,
who also built Magdalen College in Oxford.

Bullingbrook, or Bolinbrook, an ancient Town, is seated on a low Ground, at
the Spring head of a River which falls into the Witham. Of note for a Castle
built here by William of Romara, Earl of Lincoln. But much more famous, in
succeeding Times, for being the Birthplace of King Henry IV, surnamed
(according to the fashion of those Times) of Bullingbrook. And almost ever
since his Time it has been one of the Honors (as we call it) of the Kings of
England; but never made an honourary Title to any Family, till King ^ames
conferred it on Sir Oliver St. John's. Who, ^possibly might affect to be thence
denominated, as fetching his Descent from the Lady Marga^et Beauchamp,
Grandmother to King Henry VII, the Heir of the Lancastrian Family. From him the
Title fell to Oliver St. John's, his Grandchild, by Pawlet his second Son,
Oliver Lord St. John the eldest Son being slain at E^ge-hill ^ight. And from
him to his Son, the Right Honorable Paulet St. John, the present Earl of
^ullingbrook.

Not far from Bullingbrook is Eresby, which gives the Title of Baron to the
Earl of ^indsey.

Horn-castle and Tatershall are both seated on the River Bane, this last near
its Influx into the Witham. But Horn-castle is the most considerable.

Boston, in Holland Division, stands on both sides of the River Witham, within
few Miles of its fall into the Sea. This is a considerable Town, of good
Antiquity, and a Place of Trade, well inhabited and resorted unto. Over the
River it has a very fair high wooden Bridge. Its Market. Place is fair and
spacious. And the Church of special Note for its fine-built Tower, exalted to
that height as to serve as a Landmark to Mariners.

Kirkton is situate on a sandy Ground rising in that flat Country. A Town so
called from its Church, which is a fair Structure, built (Cathedral like) in
the form of a Cross, with a broad. Steeple in the middle. Of some note besides
for its excellent Pippins. But there is another Kirkton in Lindsey.

Crowland ly's some Miles East of Market-Deeping, and upon the same River,
which is the Weland. A Town seated so low, among Fen^ and miry Ground, that
there is no coming to it but by the North and East side, and that by narrow
Causeways, not admitting o^ Carts. Hence came the Proverb, that (...) the Carts
that come to Crowland are shod wi^^ Silver. It consists of 3 Streets, severed
each from other (not unlike Venice) by Watercourse running between; and on
the Banks, which are raised up, and preserved by Piles, are set Willow-Trees.
Their Cattle are kept a good distance from the Town; and when they go to milk
their Cows, they go in small Skerries or Boats. Here they take in the Pools, or
watery Places, a world of Fish and Fowl, of which they make good profit.

In short, the Ground about this Town is so very rotten, that one may thrust a
Pole in to it 30 foot. And in a Place called Hollan^ there, it is so wet, that
as one stands upon it the Earth will shake under his Feet, an^ he will be ready
to sink into it. Here are al^ many Quicksands, which have a wonderful force
both to draw to them, and to hol^ fast whatever they draw.

Spalding, a pretty Town, and a Place o^ good Trade, stands also on the Weland;
bu^ nearer its Influx into the Ocean, some mile^ North of Crowland. That is,
not far from the Washes, the neighboring Sea, so calle^ for its frequent
Inundations in these Parts.

Dunington, also situate in a Flat, and waterish like Spalding, is a
considerable Place for the great quantities of Hemp and Provision^ here sold.

To conclude, this County (which now is in the Diocese of Lincoln) was part of
the ^ncient Kingdom of Mercia in the Time of the Heptarchy, and its Inhabitants
part of the Coritani in the Time of the Romans.

Out of it are chosen, besides the two Knights of the Shire, ten Members of
Par^iament. Viz. Two out of each of these following Towns, Lincoln, Stamford,
Grantham, Boston, and Grimsby.

CHAP. XII.
Of Middlesex, Monmouthshire, Norfolk, and Northamptonshire.

Middlesex.
MIDDLESEX, a small Inland County, is bounded on the East with Essex, from
which it is parted by the River Lea; on the West, with Buckinghamshire, from
which it is severed by the Coln and the Shire-Ditch; on the North, with
Hartfordshire; and on the South, with the Thames, which parts it from Surrey
and Kent. Called Middlesex from its Situation, as lying between the East Angles
and the West Saxons.

It contains in Length, from East to West, about 24 miles; in Breadth, from
North to to South, 18. The Whole divided into seven Hundreds, wherein 203
Parishes, and 6 Market Towns.

For Sweetness of Air, or Fruitfulness of Soil this County may compare with any
Shire i^ England. From the Hills that are about it as Hampsted, Highgate,
Harrow-Hill, etc. the Prospect of the whole is seen; in this not unlik^ to Zoar
in Egypt.

London, the chief Place hereof, but withal the Metropolis, and the Glory of
the Kingdom, is too great to be crowded here within the narrow Compass of these
short Descriptions. Therefore I refer you to the Conclusion of this Part, and
so proceed to

The Market Towns, besides London and Westminster, Brentford, Tue. Stanes,
Frid. Vxbridge, Thu. Edgeware, Thu.


Brentford, in the Western Road, 7 or 8 mile^ from London, is divided into Old
and New Brentford, both so called from Brent, a smal^ River that falls here
into the Thames. O^ most renown in former times for the goo^ Success Edmund
Ironside King of England ha^ here against the Danes Anno 1016, which com^
pelled them to raise the Siege of London. No^ of most note for being the
Thorough-fare b^ twixt London and the Western Countries, the Passage up and
down by Water for the ea^ of Travelers, and a well frequented Market Once
dignified with the Title of an Earldo^ in the person of Patrick Ruthen, Earl of
For^ in Scotland, Created Earl of Brentford by Kin^ Charles I. Anno 1644.

Stanes, upon the Thames, is a large, we^ inhabited, and frequented Town. It
lies o^ the West Road of England, and has a Bridg^ over the River that leads
into Surrey.

Vxbridge is another good Town, that lies North of Stanes, on the River Coln,
which parts (as I said before) this County from Buckinghamshire. And, as it is
seated in the high Road from London to Oxford, so it is well accommodated with
Inns, and Houses of Intertainment.

As for Edgeware, it is but a small Town.

But, besides these four Market Towns, the flourishing City of London has such
an Influence over all its Neighborhood, that it swarms all over with pretty
Towns, not only in Middlesex, but even in Surrey.

In Middlesex, as Islington, Highgate, Hampsted, Chelsey, Kensington, Fulham,
Hamersmith, Thistleworth, Hounslow, etc. most of them graced with the Seats of
diverse Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Citizens.

Among which Kensington of late has the honor of enjoying some part of the
Year Their Majesty's Presence, as Hamersmith the Queen Dowager's.

Hounslow, famous for its adjoining Heath, and the notable Incampments made
there in the late Reign, in order to bring in Popery. But, as Providence was
pleased to order it, the Thames swallowed the Tiber, and the cold Northern
Heresy proved too hard for the hotheaded Jesuit.

Besides Kensington-House, here are in this County no less than five Royal
Houses; viz. Whitehall, and S. James in Westminster, Hampton Court, Enfield,
and Hanworth.

Lastly, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the
East Saxons, and its Inhabitants part of the Trinobantes, as the Romans called
them) is now in the Diocese of London.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of
Parliament; viz. 4 out of London, and 2 out of Westminster.

As for honourary Titles, I know not by what popular Error the Citizens of
London reckoned the Lord Mayor elect for Earl of Middlesex. But whatever Ground
it had, now it has none to stand on, since that Title was bestowed, first on
Lionel Lord Cranfield, Lord Treasurer of England, created Earl of Middlesex by
King James I. Anno 1622. Which continued in his Son James, and died with
Lionel, Brother of James. But in the Year 1675. it was revived by King Charles
II. in the person of the Right Honorable Charles Sackvil. Lord Buckhurst, who
was created Earl of Middlesex during the Life of his Father Richard Earl of
Dorset. Upon whose Death, two years after, he succeeded in the Earldom of
Dorset.

Neither is it to be omitted, that betwixt Brentford and Colebrook is a small
Town reckoned as 3 Manors, viz. Arlington, Shepston, and Dawling. From the
first of these Manors Henry Bennet, the late Earl of Arlington, took his
Title. Who was created first Baron of Arlington, by King Charles the Second,
Anno 1664, afterward Viscount Thetford, and Earl of Arlington (his
Birthplace) Anno 1672; and sworn Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Household,
in the Year 1674.

Monmouthshire.
MONMOVTHSHIRE, formerly a Welsh County, and now reckoned among the English, is
bounded on the East by the River Wye, which parts it from Glocestershire; on
the West, by two Welsh Counties, Brecknockshire and Glamorganshire; Northward,
by Herefordshire; and Southward, by the Mouth of the River Severn.

It contains in Length, from North to South, about 25 miles; in Breadth, from
East to West, 20. The Whole divided into six Hundreds, wherein 127 Parishes,
and 7 Market. Towns.

It is blessed, not only with a healthful and temperate Air, but also with a
rich Soil. And, though the Country be both hilly and woody, yet all Parts
thereof are fruitful, and scarce any barren. The Hills are grazed upon by
great and small Cattle, and the Valleys laden with Corn and Grass.

Its fertility is much furthered by its being plentifully watered with so many
Rivers, the principal whereof are the Vske and the Wye, the Rumney and the
Monnow, all which fall into the Severn. Among which the first two are full of
Salmon and Trouts.

Monmouth, the County-Town, bears from London West by North, and is distant
therefrom 99 miles, thus. Viz. from London to Gloucester, 81 miles, as in
Glocestershire; and from Gloucester to Monmouth, 18.

The Situation of it between two Rivers, the ^onnow and the Wye, is both very
pleasant and commodious. The Town it self large and ^air, well inhabited and
frequented; having ^he Convenience of two Bridges, one over the ^ye, and the
other over the Monnow. Once ^rtified with a Wall and Ditch, and in the ^ldst of
the Town with a stately Castle, the ^uins whereof are still to be feen. In this
Castle was born the renowned King Henry V, ^he Conqueror of France, from hence
called ^enry of Monmouth. Of some note besides, ^r being the Birthplace of
Geofry, surnamed of Monmouth, who wrote the History of Great Britain. But, of
late times especially, for being dignified with the Title of a Dukedom, in the
person of James, the late Duke of Monmouth; and, since the late Revolution,
with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the Right Honorable Charles
Mordant, Earl of Monmouth, etc. Its Market, kept on Saturdays, is considerable
for Corn, and other Provisions.

The other Market Towns are Chepstow, Sat. Newport, Sat. Pon^ Pool, Sat. Vske,
Mund. and Frid. Abergavenny, Tue. Caer-Leon, Thu.


Chepstow stands upon the side of a Hill, on the Banks of the Wye, near its
fall into the Severn. A Town in former times famous, and of great resort;
supposed to be raised out of the Ruins of Venta Silurum, 4 miles distant, the
ancient and chief City of the Silures, which flourished in the Days of Antonine
the Emperor. This Town, says Cambden, was fortified about with a Wall of a
large Circuit, and had a very spacious Castle, once fronted by a Priory, the
better part of which being pulled down, the rest was converted to a Parish
Church. At this present time, the Town is large and well built, well inhabited,
and frequented; having a fair and high Bridge over the Wye. And so it needs,
for here the River rises to a great height.

In the Year 1606. the Moor (or Marsh) near Chepstow was very much indamaged by
the Severn. For that Year, at the Change of the Moon in February, this River at
a Springtide was driven back for 3 days together with a South Wind. Which made
it swell so high, that it came rushing in a main upon this Tract, and carried
all before it.

Newport, a goodly Town, is seated on the Uske, over which it has a fair
Bridge; the Uske discharging it self not far off into the Severn, where it has
a good Haven, bearing the Name of the Town.

Some miles East from this Haven is the Gold-Cliff, so called from the golden
Color of the Stones that lie hereabouts; which makes some suspect a Mine to be
there. And opposite to that Cliff, about the midst of the Severn, lies a small
Isle, called Denny-Island.

Pont-Pool is but a small Town, seated betwixt the Hills. Of chief note for its
Iron-Mills.

Vske, a good large Town, is so called from the River Uske on which it is
situate, with a Bridge over it. It Is beautified with well built Stone-houses,
and formerly was fortified with a large and strong Castle, now ruinated.
According to Antonine, here stood the little City Burrium. But, not far from it
Northward is Ragland Castle, a noble Seat belonging to the Duke of Beaufort.

Abergavenny, by Antonine called Gobanium, stands also upon the Uske, where a
small River (Keveny by name) empty's it self into it. This is a Place of some
strength, being fortified with Walls, and a Castle of great note in former
times. The Town is large, the Houses well built, and injoy's a good Trade, for
Flannels especially.

Caer-Leon, by the Romans called Isca Silurum, stands also upon the Uske, a
little above Newport, and has a large wooden Bridge over the River. This Town
was once, a famous and flourishing City in the time of the Romans, where lay
the second Roman Legion called Augusta, to keep the Silures in aw. The Ruins of
its stately Buildings, Palaces, Temples, Theaters, together with the
Water-pipes, Vaults, Hot-Houses, Altars, and Roman Coyns, often dug up here,
do sufficiently evidence its former Antiquity and Greatness. Here King Arthur
kept his Court; and in this City was a famous School or College, to learn
Astronomy, and other Arts. As for its present State, the Town is pretty large,
and the Houses for the generality built of Stone. It has yet the Ruins of a
Castle standing.

To conclude, this County (formerly the Habitation of the Silures) is in the
Welsh Diocese of Llandaff.

Besides the two Knights of the Shire, there is but one Member elected to serve
in parliament, and that is out of Monmouth.

Norfolk.
NORFOLK, a Maritime County of a large extent, is bounded Eastward and
Northward with the German Ocean; Westward, with the River Ouse, which severs it
from the County's of Lincoln and Cambridge; Southward, with the little Ouse and
the Waveney, which part it from Suffolk. Thus Norfolk, what with the Sea, and
what with the Rivers, is so encompassed with Waters, that it wants very little
of being an Islland of it felf.

It contains in Length, from East to West, 50 miles; in Breadth, from North to
South, about 35. The Whole divided into 31 Hundreds, wherein 660 Parishes, and
31 Market Towns. Which is an Argument of its Populousness.

Here the Air is sharp and piercing, especially near the Sea, and in the
Champain Part; which occasions a later Spring and Harvest.

The Soil in many Places, but chiefly along the Seacoast, which is a Champain
Country, affords plenty of Corn. The Heaths feed a World of Sheep, and breed
abundance of Conies. And the Woodland Part serves for Grazing of Cattle, yet
not without Cornground.

The Sea, and the Rivers besides that glide through this Country, strive as it
were to furnish it with their plenty of F^sh. And, among these (besides those
abovenamed, viz. the two Ouses, and the Waveney,) there are two of chief note,
called the Yare, and the Thryn.

The Yare, particularly noted for its great plenty of a certain Fish called
Ruff, whose body is all Prickled over; the tail and fins spotted with black
Specks. This Fish eats tender and short as a Perch, and is counted a wholesome
Fish. It delights in sandy Places, and is rarely seen in any other River. One
Thing is observable of it, that, when the Fish is angry, the fins stand up
stiff; and, after its Anger is over, they fall flat again.

In short, the Soil of this Country, according to the Variety of Places, is of
different nature. In some Parts it is fat, rank, and full of moisture; in
others, very light and sandy. Yet so, that one contributing to the other, and
the Sea giving help to both, it is a very plentiful Country for Corn, Sheep,
and Fish.

Norwich, the chief Place hereof, and a Bishops See, bears from London
North-East and by North, and is distant therefrom 90 miles, thus. From London
to Ware, 20; to Barkway, 11 more; thence to Witle^ford-Bridge, 10; and to
New Market, 12 more; from Newmarket to The^ford, 16; to Attleborough, 10 more;
thence to Windham, 5; and to Norwich, 6 more,

A City seated on the River Yare, which runs thence to Yarmouth, and over which
it has several Bridges.

It was formerly the Seat of the East Angles, and then a Place of great
splendor. But it has since undergone so many Calamities, by Sword and Famine,
by Fire and Pestilence, that it is much it should prove to this day, a fair,
large, populous, and well frequented City. Insomuch that it ly's out a Mile and
a half in length, and half as much in breadth, containing in that Circuit about
20 Parishes; well walled about, with several Turrets, and 12 Gates for
entrance, but not without much waste Ground within it.

Its chief Buildings are the Cathedral, beautified with a lofty Spire; then the
Bishops and the Duke of Norfolk's Palaces, the Market-House, the Cross, and
the House of Correction made of free Stone, and so well cemented that no Mortar
is seen. Here is also an Hospital, where 100 poor Men and Women are maintained;
and the Ruins of an ancient Castle, of the Saxons building. In short, here is
so pleasant an Intermixture of the Houses with Trees, that it may not
improperly be called an Orchard in a City, or a City in an Orchard; the
populousness of a City, and the pleasure of the Country meeting here together.
Of some Note besides, for giving the Title of Earl to his Grace the Duke of
Norfolk, Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Norwich.

Finally, this City does enjoy a great Trade, but chiefly for its Stuffs,
Stockings, and other Manufactures here made; for the learning of which it is
beholding to the Dutch that came to inhabit here. It has three Markets a Week,
Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays; the first and last very great, for all
sorts of Provisions.

The other Market Towns are Lyn, Sat. and Mund. Yarmouth, Sat. Thetford, Sat.
Hingham, Sat. New-Buckenham Sat. Swafham, Sat. Downham, Sat. Holt, Sat.
Burnham, Sat. Cromere, Sat. Repcham, Sat. Alesham, Sat. Worsted, Sat. Sechy,
Mund. East-Herling, Tue, Fulcham, Tue, Caston, Tue, Harlston, Wedn. Watton,
Wedn. North-Walsham, Thu, Attlebury, Thu, Fakenham, Thu, Windham, Frid,
East-Derham, Frid, Diss, Frid, Snetham, Frid, Walsingham, Frid,


Besides Southwold, and Winfield, two new Markets; and Hickling, whose
Market-Days I am ignorant of.

^yn, formerly called Bishops Lyn as appertaining to the Bishops of Norwich,
till King Henry VIII, gave it the Name of ^yn Regis or King's Lyn, is seated in
the Western Part of the Country, upon the Banks of the Ouse, near its fall into
that Part of the Sea which is called the Washes. Watered besides by two little
Rivers, that fall there into the Ouse, which are passed over by about 15
Bridges. A Town of good antiquity, large, and well built, containing 3
Parish-Churches; and for its Defense, encompassed with a Wall, and a good
Ditch. Well Inhabited by Merchants and Tradesmen, who drive a considerable
Trade, and the more by reason of its commodious Haven. Yet it is much eclipsed
in its Trade, to what it was formerly, because of the stoppage of a Sluice upon
the Ouse, which does so obstruct the Current of salt Water, that the River is
scarce navigable to Cambridge.

Nigh unto this Town, on the other side of the Ouse, is a little Marsh Country,
called Marsh-Land, very subject to the Inundations of the Sea, and therefore
very moist and aguish. But, in recompense, its Soil is exceeding fat, and feed
abundance of Cattle. In this Marsh are seated several Towns, but so destitute
of fresh Water for household Use, that many of 'em are fain to get a supply
thereof at 4 miles distance.

About 3 miles from Lyn, toward the Sea, stands a decayed Town called
Castle-Rising. Its Decay occasioned by its Haven's being many years since
choakt up with Sands, whereby it is become useless. Which has done a Kindness to
Lyn.

Yarmouth, the best Harbor in all this County, and the Key of this Coast, is
seated at the Mouth of the River Yare, from whence it is called Yarmouth. A
Town of good Strength as well by Nature as Art, well built, and pretty large;
and yet it has but one Church, which is beautified with a lofty Spire. The same
is well inhabited, and much resorted unto by Seamen; affording a ready Passage
to Holland, and being a frequent Shelter to the New Castle Fleets, when
distressed by Weather. Of special note besides, for Herringfishing, in the Seas
adjacent, in the Month of September. Which draws a great Concourse of People
hither, and makes the Town much richer all the Year after. Lastly, it is
dignified with the Title of Earl, in the person of the Right Honorable William
Paston, the present Earl of Yarmouth.

Thetford is an Inland Town, situate on the Confluence of the Thet and the
little Ouse, over which it has a Bridge leading to Suffolk. A Place of great
Antiquity, built out of the Ruins of the ancient City Sitomagus, which was
destroyed by the merciless Danes. The Bishop's See of the East Angles was from
North-Elmham removed hither, and from hence to Norwich. It is not very well
Inhabited, to what it has been. However this is the Town, where the
Lent-Assizes for the County are usually kept.

Herling, and New Buckenham, ly not far from Thetford, to the Eastward; Diss,
and Harleston, on the Waveney; Watton, Windham, Hingham, Swafham, and
East-Derham, do not ly far asunder, about the middle of the County. Further to
the Northward you will find Repeham, Caston, Fakenham, Walsingham, Holt,
Ale^ham, Worsted, North Walsham, and Hickling this last in a Marsh-Ground, not
far from the Sea.

Downham is upon the Ouse, over which it has a Bridge, leading into
Cambridgeshire. Snetham, North of Lyn, is seated on a bivuler, not far from the
Sea. Burnham-Market, and Cromere, are two Sea-Towns in the North Parts of the
County. Between which is Clay, another Sea-Town, on three sides encompassed
with Waters, and once a Market Town, but now discontinued. And near it
Wayborn-hope, a noted Place amongst Seamen; as is Winterton Ness, or Point, in
the East, which is very coldly seated. And yet it is observed, that the Ground
about Winterton is one of the richest and fattest in England.

Among the aforesaid Towns, Walsingham was formerly renowned, as for its
College of Canons, so for the continual Concourse of Pilgrims to this Place.
Who came hither to pay their Superstitious Devotion to the Blessed Virgin, at a
Chapel near the two Wells called to this day the Virgin Mary's Wells. It was
also a Place of note, for its good Saffron.

Near Burnham-Market, within 2 Miles from it to the Westward, is a small
Country-Town, called Brancaster, the Ruins of an ancient Town known by the Name
of Branodunum. Seated near the Seashore, and a Place of good account in the
time of the Romans, who kept here a Garrison.

Not far from Hickling, in the North-East Parts, is the ancient decayed Abbey
of St. Bennet's in the Holme, built by the Danish King Canute. An Abbey so
fortified afterward by its Monks with Walls and Bulwarks, that it seemed
rather a Castle than a Cloister; and yet was betrayed by a Monk to William the
Conqueror. The Bishop of Norwich retains to this Day the Title of Lord Abbot of
St. Bennets. And it is observable, that hereabouts both Cockles and Perwinkles
are dug out of the Ground.

Lastly, this County (which is the largest in England next to Yorkshire, but
much more populous) was Part of the Kingdom of the East Angles, in the time of
the Heptarchy; and its Inhabitants, part of the Iceni, as the Romans called
them.

It is observed of the People in this County, that they are notably industrious
for Plough and Manufactures, insomuch that one shall hardly see a Beggar
throughout all the Country. And yet (which one would wonder at) they are
notable Wranglers, and generally so well versed in the Quirks of the Law, that
they create more work for the Assizes than almost all the Circuit else.
Accordingly Norfolk is the County, which commonly yields the best Breed of
Lawyers, and has furnished the Courts of Justice with many an emiment Man in
the Laws of England. But a great Antiquary has made another material
Observation, That in this County are a hundred Families of ancient Gentry, that
never were attainted of high Treason. Which if it be true, the Gentry here have
had better fortune than the Dukes, Dutchesses, and Earls of Norfolk.

His Grace, Henry Howard, the present Duke of Norfolk, derives his Title from
his noble Ancestor John-Lord Howard, created Duke of Norfolk by King Edward IV.
Anno 1483, and descended from the Lady Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, Daughter
of Tho. de Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, first Son of King Edward I.

Out of this County are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, ten
Members of Parliament. Viz. Two out of each of these following Places, Norwich,
Kings I in, Yarmouth, Thetford, and Castle-rising.

Northamptonshire.
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded on the East with the Counties
of Cambridge, Huntington, Bedford, and Buckingham; on the West, with Rutland,
Leicestershire, and Warwickshire; Northward, with the Counties of Lincoln,
Rutland, and Leicester; Southward, with Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire.

This County, being long, but narrow, runs in Length, from North to South,
ahout 50 miles; and in Breadth, from East to West, but half. The Whole divided
into 20 Hundreds, wherein 326 Parishes, and 13 Market Towns.

Here the Air is temperate and healthful; the Soil as rich, either for Corn or
Grass, as in any Place in England. And the Inhabitants find such a Profit here
by Grazing and Tillage, that they improve the Ground every where. Insomuch that
it is said, there is less waste Ground in this County than in any other.

As for Rivers, and other fresh Streams, it is as well watered as most Counties
are. Its principal Rivers are the Nen and the Weland, both having their Rise
here; besides the Ouse, which rises in the South Parts, near Bucking, hamshire.

A further Proof of the excellency of this County might be fetched from its
Populousness. For it is so garnished with Towns, that in many Places 20 or 30
Steeples present themselves at one view. And considering its Extent, it is said
to be honored with the Seats of as many (if not more) of the Nobility and
Gentry, as any County in the Kingdom.

Northampton, the chief Place hereof, ly's North-West from London, and (by
common Computation) is distant from it 54 miles, thus, From London to Barnet,
10; thence to St. Allans, 10; and to Dunstable, 10 more; from Dunstable to
Stony Stratford, 20; and to Northampton, 10 more.

A Town pleasantly seated on the Banks of the River Nen, where it meets with
two Rivulets, one from the North, the other from the South. And, though it has
suffered much by the sore hand of the Dane, and other Calamities (and of late
particularly by the dreadful Fire which buried it all in Ashes in September
1675) yet it has raised it self again more glorious than before. So that for
Circuit and Beauty it may at this time be ranked with many Cities. Fortified
heretofore with good Walls, and a strong Castle; and seated in so good an Air,
that once the Students of Cambridge had a mind to remove their University
hither. Here the Inhabitants drive a considerable Trade, especially of Leather;
and its Market, which is on Saturdays, is well served with Provisions. This
Town is the Place where the County-Goal, and the Assizes are kept. Of special
note, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable George Compton, the
present Earl of Northampton. Devolved to him from his noble Ancestor William,
Lord Compton, and Lord President of Wales, Created Earl of Northampton by King
James I. Anno 1618.

The other Market Towns are Peterborough, Sat. Oundle, Sat. Higham-Ferrers,
Sat. Rothwell, Mund. Thrapston, Tue. Towcester, Tue. King's Cliff, Tue.
Wellingborow, Wed. Bra^kley, Wed. Daventry. Wed. Kettering, Frid. Bodkingham,


Among which Peterborough is seated in a Nook (or Angle) of the County,
bordering upon Cambridgeshire, and Huntingtonshire, where formerly had been a
Gulf or Whirlpool of an exceeding depth. It Is seated on the River Nen, over
which it has a Bridge leading into Huntingtonshire. A Town of no great account,
but for being a Bishops See, since the Reign of Henry VIII. For, as it is no
plausible Place either for health or pleasure, so it stands out of the way for
Trade. Yet it shows two handsome Streets, a large Marketplace, and a fair
Parish Church, besides the Abbey. Which last, from a Monastery founded by
Wolpher the Mercian King, is now become a Cathedral. And, from that Monastery
dedicated by him to St. Peter. This Town, formerly known by the Name of
Medanshede, came to be called Peterburgh, or Peterborough. Dignify^d with the
Title of an Earldom in the person of Henry Mordant, the present Earl of
Peterborough; devolved to him from his Father John, Lord Mordant, created Earl
of Peterborough by King Charles I. Anno 1627.

Oundle is pleasantly seated on the Banks of the Nen, over which it has two
Bridges. A well built and uniform Town, beautified with a fair Church, a free
School, and an Almshouse.

Nigh unto Oundle Northwards, and upon the same River, stands
Fotheringhay-Castle, environed on all sides with pleasant Meadows. Noted for
that here Mary, Queen of Scots, was beheaded.

Thrapston, Higham-Ferrers, and Wellingborow, ly all three upon the Nen; the
first two on the Eastern, the last on the Western Banks and each of them with a
Bridge over the River. Higham-Ferrers has a Free School for the Education of
Youth, and an Alms house for the Relief of poor people; and was anciently
strengthened with a Castle, whose Ruins are yet to be seen. Wellingborow,
pleasantly seated upon the Ascent of a Hill, is a large, and well inhabited
Town, enjoying a good Trade, beautified with a fair Church, and having the
Convieniency besides of a Free School.

Not far from Rothwell, or Rowel, is Naseby, which is said to stand on the
highest Ground in England, near which the Avon and the Nen (two considerable
Rivers) have their Springheads. A noted Town for the Battle fought here June
14th 1645; where the Kings Forces commanded by Prince Rupert were totally
routed by General Fairfax.

Towcester, situate in a Valley, and on the Banks of a small River that empty's
it self in the Ouse, is a Place of good Antiquity. Cambden takes it for the
ancient Tripontium, which took its Name from 3 Bridges; the Roman Port-way
(which in many places between it and Stony-Stratford shows it self) being cut
through by three Streams or Channels, which the Rivulet there divides it self
into. About the Year 917. it was so strongly fortified, as to resist the
furious Assaults of the Danes. At present it is but a small Town, beautified
however with a fine Church.

Near this Place Eastward is Grafton, a Road-Town in this part of
Northamptonshire, with a fine Park adjoining to it, and a Mannorhouse of great
Antiquity, most part whereof was burnt and pulled down in the long Intestine
War, Anno 1643. Memorable for the Marriage here consummated betwixt Edward IV.
and the Lady Gray, the first King o^ England since the Conquest that married
his Subject. This was the ancient Seat of the Family de Wideville, Earls of
Rivers. And Richard, the last of the male Line, dying Anno 1490. did by his
Will bequeath it (amongst other Lands) to Thomas Gray, Marquess of Dorset. In
which Name it continued till Henry VIII, with whom it was exchanged for other
Lands in Leicestershire, and so has ever since continued in the Crown. Of late
become of more remark, for giving the Title of Duke to his Grace Henry
Fitz-Roy, created Baron of Sudbury, Viscount Ipswich, and Earl of Euston Anno
1672, and Duke of Grafton five years after.

Brackley, a Town of Note when it was in a manner the Staple Town in the County
for Wool, is seated near the Spring of the Ouse, upon the edge of the County
toward Buckinghamshire. It contains two Parish-Churches, and had formerly a
College, now made use of for a Free School.

Daventry and Kettering are seated, each of 'em upon a Rivulet, that falls into
the Nen. The first, a great Road-Town from London to the North-West Counties,
and from thence hither. The last, North-East from that, is delightfully seated
on an Ascent; and has a Sessions House for the Justices of Peace of the County,
who sometimes assemble here.

Rockingham, a small Town, is seated on the Weland. A Town of note in former
Time for its Castle, long since demolished.

Lastly, this County, together with Rutland, make up the Diocese of
Peterborough. In the Time of the Saxons, it made part of the Kingdom of Mercia;
and its Inhabitants, in the Romans Time, part of the Coritani.

Out of it are chosen, besides the two Knights of the Shire, seven Members of
Parliament. Viz. 2 out of Northampton, 2 out of Peterborough, 2 out of
Brackley, and 1 out of Higham-Ferrers.

CHAP. XIII.
Of Northumberland, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, and Rutland.

Northumberland,
NORTHVMBERLAND, a Maritime County, and the furthest North in England, is
bounded on the East by the German Ocean; on the West, by Cumberland, and the
Cheviot Hills which part it from Scotland; Northward, by the River Twede, which
divides it also from Scotland; and Southward, by the Bishopric of Durham, from
which severed in part by the River Tine.

Its Form is triangular, contains in Length from North to South about 40 long
Miles, and in Breadth from East to West (at the broadest) 30. The Whole divided
into six Wards, wherein 460 Parishes, and but 6 Market Towns.

The Air of this County is sharp and piercing in Winter, and sometimes troubled
with deep Snows and pinching Frosts, suitable to its Climate. But yet it is
nothing near so sharp as the People. And by my late Experience, here wet
Weather is not so sensible and searching, as it is in Middlesex. It Is possible
the warm Breaths that continually come out of its numberless Colepits helps,
with the Vapors of the Sea, to take off the rawness of a cold dampish Air.

For the Soil, as this County is nearly related to Scotland, so it is one of
the worst Counties in England; being for the most part rough and hilly, and
hard to be manured. Yet in some Parts, chiefly toward the Sea, it is fertile
enough. But the greatest Riches of this Country lies in the Bowels of the
Earth, full of Coal-mines. Which supply with Coals, not only this Country
(where that Fuel is always bought at very easy rates) but a good Part of
England besides; and London particularly, for whose Use many hundred Sail of
Ships have yearly from hence their Loading.

The Coal-Pits, made use of to get up this Treasure, are all square, commonly 7
or 8 foot in diameter, and timbered from top to bottom; some 30, some 40, more
or less, but few above 50 fadoms deep. A great Depth for Workmen, to go and
rake a Livelihood. And yet here is a Legion of such Men, bred and born to it,
that spend most of their Life in this Land of Darkness; in continual Danger
(besides that of the Rope) of being crushed below by a Thrust, sometimes in
Danger of Water, and in some places of Fire.

The Way to go down these Pits, and to come up, is by the help of a Rope; one
end whereof being made into a Loop, the Workman gets a Leg and Knee into it, as
far as the very Hip. Thus hugging the Rope with one Arm, his Life wrapped up with
it, down he goes, while the Rope turns about an Engine made for that purpose.
If the Rope fails, as sometimes it does through Carelessness, there is an end of
the Man and of the Conveyance.

By a Thrust is meant the fall of some Earth, or great Stones, whereby it is the
ill fate of some to be crushed; as it is of others to be drowned by a sudden
Irruption of Waters, from an old Waste, or otherwise.

But some Pits at Sunderland, in the Bishopric of Durham, are subject besides
to Fire-Damps. So they call an Inflammation of the Air in those subterraneous
Parts, which being more than ordinary affected with sulphurous matter, are
sometimes apt to catch fire, and then all go's to wrack. It breaks out like a
Thunderbolt, carries all away with it higher than the Pits Mouth, and that
with a dismal noise, as it were with a crack of Thunder. In this Case one might
compare the inflamed Sulphur to Gunpowder, the Coalpit to a great Gun, and
what it brings up with it to Bullets, it comes up with such a force. But, when
this happens, the Workmen foresee it, by their Candles burning blue and blazing
more than ordinary. Whereupon they lay themselves flat upon the Ground, and let
the Meteor work it self above it.

But this is too deep a piece of Geography, for me to insist upon. I leave it
therefore to those Men of deep reaches who live upon the Spot; in order first
to take a View of Newcastle, the chief Place of this County.

Newcastel, for distinctions sake called Newcastel upon Tine, to difference it
from another Town of that Name in Staffordshire, bears from London
North-by-West, and is reckoned to be distant from it 212 miles. Viz. 200 from
London to Durham, for the particulars whereof I refer you to my Description of
Durham; and 12 more from Durham to Newcastle.

This Town is seated on the North-Bank of the River Tine, about 7 miles from
its fall into the Sea. Over the River it has a fair Stone Bridge leading to
Gateshead in the Bishopric of Durham, with an Iron-Gate upon it, which parts
the two Counties. It stands high and low, part upon a steep Hill, and part in
the bottom on it near the River. The Streets upon the Ascent are so very steep,
that they stand like so many Ladders. And yet both Men and Horses are so used
to 'em, that they make little of it, either with or without a Load. The Houses
are most of Stone, some Timber, and a few Brick-houses. In short, it is a Place
of that extent as to contain four large Parishes, with as many Churches. The
Whole encompassed with a Wall, and fortified with a Castle, but neglected, and
going to ruin. Built by Robert, Son to William the Conqueror; from whence this
Town, formerly called Monk-Chester, took the Name of Newcastle,

Among the other public Buildings of this Place, the Key next to the River,
the Townhouse ^ard by it, the Custom-house upon Sandy-Hill, and S. Nicholas
Church in the midst of the Town, are the most Remarkable. Ships of good Burden
come up to the very Key as ^ar as the Bridge; though the Newcastle-^leet seldom
comes higher than Sheales, near ^he River's Mouth. Under the Townhouse (which
(...) no mean Structure) is the Exchange, or ^eeting Place for Merchants.
Before this ^ouse, in the Marketplace, stood lately a ^ew brazen Statue, the
Image of the late ^ing James on horseback. Which, soon after is Abdication, was
suddenly pulled down by ^e Forces then quartered in Town; to the ^reat grief of
many devout Jacobites in those ^arts, who reverently paid to the Image the
honor they retained for the Original. S. Ni^olas Church stands very lofty on
the top of Hill, and looks more like a Cathedral than Parish Church, with a
fair Steeple of curious ^rchitecture.

But Newcastle does not glory so much in all ^is, as it does in the great Trade
it drives ^oth by Sea and Land for all Commodities; ^somuch that one may well
call it the Bristol (...) the North, it being the wealthiest, as it is (...)
most trading Place in the whole Northern ^ract.

It Is true nothing has made it thrive so ^uch as the Coal-Trade, being
surrounded ^s it is) with Coal-Mines, and blessed with ^e Convenience of a
navigable River for ^e Transportation of so necessary and useful Commodity.
For the Carrying on of this Trade they have such Privileges, as might seem to
some people exorbitant. No Owner of Coals can load his Ship with his own
Commodity, but it must be done by a Member of a Company they have for that
purpose, called the Company of Fitters; and every Fitter has six pence allowed
him for every Newcastle Chaldron that go's out, which makes up near upon two of
London Measure. The Town moreover takes 3 pence a Chaldron, as a Duty; besides
12 pence a Chaldron to the King, paid at the Custom-house.

To conclude, Newcastle is a County of it self, that is, has the Privilege of
governing it self independently from the rest of the County.

Of some note besides for giving the Title of Duke to his Grace Henry
Cavendish, the present Duke of Newcastle. Whose Father, William Cavendish, was
created first Earl, afterward Marquess of Newcastle, by King Charles the
first; and in the Year 1664. Duke of Newcastle, Earl of Ogle, etc. by Charles
II.

It has two Markets a Week, viz. on Tuesdays and Saturdays, both very
considerable for all sorts of Provisions; but particularly abounding with Cods
and Salmon, in their proper Season.

The other Market Towns are Barwick, Sat. Alnewick, Sat. Hexam, Tue. Morpeth,
Wedn. and Weller, Thu.


Barwick is seated at the mouth of the River Twede, over which it has a fair
Bridge, supported by no less than 14 or 15 Arches. But as it stands on the
North side of the River, by the Bounds of Northumberland, it ought rather to be
counted in Scotland than England. And, because it has been in the hands of the
English from the Reign of Edward IV, therefore in all Acts of Parliament, and
Royal Proclamations, wherein this Town is concerned, Barwick upon Twede is
always named by it self, as a distinct Part of this Realm, and of
Northumberland by consequence. However, as it is so near a Neighbor to this
County, I am unwilling to deviate from the Method of all Geographers, whose way
is to bring it under this Head, as if it were a part of Northumberland.

In short, Barwick, by its Situation, is a Place of good Strength, being almost
surrounded with Water, what with the Sea, and what with the River. But it is
fortified besides with good Walls and a Castle, besides other Fortifications.
The Occasion of it was its being a Frontire-Town, sometimes possessed by the
Scots, and sometimes by the English, before these two Nations came to be united
under one Head. So that, upon the least Rupture, this Town was sure to undergo
the first brunts of the War. It is large and populous, and the Houses well
built; enjoying a good Trade, especially for Corn and Salmon. Here one may have
a good Salmon for 12 pence.

Lastly, Barwick is, like Newcastel, a County of it self. Dignified also with
the Title of a Dukedom, and that by the late King James, in the person of James
Fitz-James, the present Duke of Barwick, his natural Son, ^inked with him in
his Misfortunes.

Alnwick, so called from the River Alne upon which it is seated, about 8 miles
from the Sea, is an indifferent good Town. Once strengthened with a great
Castle, which is now something ruinous. However a noted Place, for the Battle
fought here between the English and the Scots, in the Reign of Henry II; where
William, King of Scots, was taken Prisoner.

Hexam is situate West of Newcastel, on the South Side of the River Tine. Once
a Bishopric, in the Infancy of the Saxon Church; the Bishop whereof called
Episcopus Hagulstadiensis, according to Beda. S. Eata, the fifth Bishop of
Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, was the first Bishop of this Place. Succeeded by
nine others, till by the fury and rapine of the Danes it discontinued, the
Jurisdiction of it being added to the Sea of York. But in the Reign of Henry
VIII. it was taken from that Archbishopric, and by Authority of Parliament
united to the County of Northumberland, whereby it became annexed to the
Bishopric of Durham. Here was a most stately Church, said to surpass most
Minsters in England, before a great part thereof was pulled down by the Scots.

Morpeth, a goodly Town, is situate on the River Wensbeck, and fortified with a
Castle Its Market is esteemed the best in the County for Provisions and living
Cattle, which from hence are dispersed to diverse Parts of the Kingdom. The Town
of some note besides, for giving the Title of Viscount to the Ea^ of Carlisle.

Some miles South-west from it, near a Town called Belsey, on the River Pont,
stands Ogle^ Castle, formerly belonging to the Barons Ogle^ and now to the Duke
of Newcastle, from hence styled Earl of Ogle.

As for Weller, it is but a small Town, seated on the side of a Hill, near the
Banks of the River Till, which runs Northward into the Twede. But its Market is
great for Corn, and other Provisions.

Of the Islands along the Seacoast of Northumberland.
Along the Coast of this Country you will find 3 principal Islands, as you go
from South to North; viz. Cocket, Farn, and Holy Island.

Cocket is but a small Island, lying not far from Wetherington Castle.

Farne Island, something bigger, lies North from Cocket, 2 miles from Bamburg
Castle. North-East of which lie six smaller Islands, hardly worth the naming.

Holy Island, the biggest of the three, and yet of no great extent, is not far
from Barwick. This Island, being in shape not unlike a Wedge, runs out with a
Neck of Land toward Northumberland. And this is it which formerly was known by
the Name of Lindisfarne, in the dawning of Christianity among the Northumbers
made a Bishops See by S. Aidan, one of the first Apostles of these Parts.
Selected for that Dignity by that holy Man, for the Solitude and Privacy of it,
which made it thought more fit and proper for Devotion. Till at last, by the
religious Lives of so many pious Bishops, Monks, and others of the Clergy as
did inhabit here, it got the Name of Holy Island. And here the Sea continued
353 years, that, is from the Year 637 to 990, under 22 Bishops, hence called
Bishops of Lindisfarne. From whence the Sea was removed to Durham, the
Insolences of the Danes (who then terribly raged on these Coasts) compelling
these religious Men to forsake their Solitude.

The Air of this Island is so unhealthfull, and the Soil ungrateful, that it
is but thinly peopled. Fish and Fowl is the best Accommodation of it. So that
here is but one Town with a Church and Castle; under which is a good Haven,
defended by a Block-house.

In short, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of Northumberland, and
its Inhabitants part of the Ottadini, as the Romans caded them) is now in the
Diocese of Durham.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, six Members of
Parliament. Viz. 2 by Newcastle, 2 by Morpeth, and 2 more by Barwick.

Lastly, this County is noted for the Title of Duke and Earl it has given to
several noble Personages, but with frequent Interruptions. As for the Title of
Duke, I find but one that has enjoyed it, till of late, viz. John Dudley, Earl
of Warwick, and Lord Admiral^ Duke of Northumberland, beheaded by Quee^ Mary.
Put that of Earl has gone through several Changes, and different Families. The
Piercies are those who have enjoyed it the long est of any, and yet not without
some Interruption too. The first of 'em that had the Title conferred upon him
was Henry Piercy Lord Constable, who took possession of i^ Anno 1377. under the
Reign of Richard II. Three of his Name and Family enjoyed it after him, before
John Nevil, Lord Montague, was advanced to this Honor by King Edward II; who,
after six years, resigned it to Henry Piercy, that had been dispossessed of it.
Another Henry Piercy enjoyed it after him, who died in the Year 1527. And 24
years after his Death, the foresaid John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, was by Edward
VI. created Duke of Northumberland, viz. Anno 1551. Six Years after this the
Title of Earl returned to the Piercies, in the person of Thomas, Earl of
Northumberland. In which Family it has continued ever since, till the Year
1670, when Joceline Piercy died at Turin in Italy, without Issue male. At
present we have a Duke of Northumberland, his Grace George Fitz-Roy, third Son
to the Duchess of Cleveland; who in the Year 1674. was created by King Charles
II. Baron of Pontefract, Viscount Falmouth, and Duke of Northumberland.

Nottinghamshire.
NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded Eastward with Lincolnshire, from
which it is separated a good way by the River Trent; Westward, with Derbyshire,
and some part of Yorkshire; Northward, with Yorkshire; and Southward, with
Leicestershire.

It is of an oval Form, doubling in length twice its breadth.

Its Length, from North to South, is about 40 miles; the Breadth, from East to
West, 20. The Whole divided into 8 Wapentakes or Hundreds, 168 Parishes, and 9
Market Towns.

As for the Soil of this County, part of it is Clay-Ground, part sandy Ground,
and the rest Woody. The South East Part, being watered by the Trent and small
Rivers that fall into it, is the most fruitful; and this is the Clay Part. The
Western, where the Forest of Shirwood is, (so famous for Robin-Hood, and his
Companions) is stocked not only with Wood, but Pit-Coal; well served besides
with Game.

Besides the River Trent, here are several small Streams whereby this Country
is watered. Among which the Iddie, which empty's it self Northward into the
Dun, is the most considerable.

As for the Air, it is counted as good here, especially in the sandy Parts, as
any where else in England.

Nottingham, the Shire-Town, from whence the whole County takes its
Denomination, is 94 miles from London, to the North-West. Viz. from London to
Leicester, 78 miles, the Particulars whereof you may see in Leicestershire;
from thence to Loughborow 8; and to Nottingham, 8 more.

It Is seated about a mile on the North-side of the River Trent, upon a Hill,
which overlooks it. Over this River it has a fair Stonebridge, and another over
the Lean a small River; besides two other Bridges over two Ponds, called the
Cheney Bridges. The Town is large, containing 3 Parish Churches; for Buildings,
fair Streets, and a spacious Marketplace, not yielding to many Cities. But of
most fame for its Castle, which for strength, stateliness, and prospect, did
formerly challenge the precedence of most Castles in England. Honored besides
with the Title of an Earldom, at this time enjoyed by the Right Honorable
Daniel Finch, Earl of Nottingham, and principal Secretary of State. Descended
to him from his Father Heneage Finch, Lord High Chancellor of England in the
Reign of King Charles II, and by him created Earl of Nottingham, Baron Finch of
Daventry, etc. Which happened soon after the Death of the Lord Charles Howard,
who dying without Issue male was the last of that Family which enjoyed that
Title. In short, Nottingham is a Town well inhabited and frequented, this being
the Place where the County-Goal is, and where the Assizes are held; and injoy's
as good a Trade, as most Inland Towns. For Provisions it has 3 Markets a Week,
Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, this last the most considerable.

The other Market Towns are Southwell, Sat. Redford, Sat. Tuxford, Mund.
Newark, Wedn. Worksop, Wedn, Mansfield, Thu. Bingham, Thu. Blithe, Thu.


Southwell is seated on a Rivulet, that falls not far off from hence into the
Trent. It Is an ancient Town, and has a Collegiate Church.

Redford is situate on the River Iddel. Not far from which is Littleburg, on
the Trent, noted for its Ferry, much resorted unto for a Passage into
Lincolnshire.

Tuxford, from its Clay-Ground called Tuxford upon Clay, has nothing remarkable
in it but its Church and Steeple, both very neat and pretty, though in a dirty
Soil. For the Convenience of Travelers, this being a Road-Town to and from the
North, is accommodated with two very good Inns lately built.

Newark, the Place of most note in this County next to Nottingham, ly's in the
high Road to York, on the Banks of the River Trent, where it divides it self
into two Branches, and makes up an Island before the Town. This is a good large
Town; otherwise Inconsiderable, but for its Market Place, its. Church and
Steeple, and the Ruins of a stately Castle, which are still to be seen. It Is
true it gives the Title of Viscount to the Earl of Kingston.

Mansfield and Worksop are both in the Forest of Sherwood. The first, a good
large Town, graced with well built Houses, well inhabited, and having a good
Trade for Malt, and other Provisions. The other of chief note for the great
store it yields of the best Licorish in all the Northern Parts.

As for Ringham and Blithe, they are but indifferent Towns; and their Markets,
accordingly.

To conclude, this County (now in the Diocese of York) was part of the ancient
Kingdom of Mercia; and its Inhabitants, part of the C^ritani, as the Romans
called them.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but six Members
to serve in Parliament. Viz. Two by Nottingham, two by Newark, and two more by
Eastretford.

Oxfordshire
OXFORDSHIRE, another Inland County, is bounded on the East by Buckinghamshire,
from which it is divided in part by the Chiltern-Hills; on the West, by
Glocestershire; on the North, by the Counties of Warwick and Northampton; on
the South, by the Thames, which parts it from Parkshire.

It contains in Length, from North to South, about 40 Miles; in Breadth, from
East to West, 26. The Whole divided into 14 Hundreds, 280 Parishes, and 15
Market Towns.

The Air of this County is mightily commended for its sweetness and
temperateness, as the Soil is for its fruitfulness. Both which make this
Country so much inhabited as it is by Gentry. And that which adds much to it,
is the pleasantness of its Hills here, well doathed with Wood, and stored (as
well as the Downs) with Variety of Game, both for the Hawk and Hound.

Besides the Thames, which waters the South Parts of it, here is the Tame and
the Isis, which make up the Thames; the Cherwell, the Windrush, and the
Evenlode. So that this County is as well Irrigated, as most are in the Kingdom.

Oxford, the principal Place in this Shire, from whence it takes its Name,
bears from London West-North-West, and is distant therefrom 47 Miles, thus.
From London to Vxbridge, 15; to Beaconfield, 7 more; thence to High Wickam, 5;
to Stoken-Church, 5 more; from thence to Wheatly-Bride, 9; and to Oxford, 6
more.

A Place of that Importance, especially in relation to the Muses, that it
deserves a particular Description; for which I refer you (together with that of
London and Cambridge) to the Conclusion of this Part. So I proceed to

The other Market Towns of this County, Burford, Sat. Deddington, Sat.
Watlington, Sat. Woodstock, Tame, Bampton, Wed. Chipping-Norton, Wed. Banbury,
Thu. Henly, Thu. Witney, Thu. Burcester, Frid. Fairford, Bistow, Coleford,


Among which Burford, seated on an Ascent near the River Windrush in the West
of Oxfordshire, is a Town of good Antiquity. Remarkable heretofore for a great
Battle fought near it about the Year 750. between Cuthbert, a Tributary King of
the West Saxons, and Ethelbald the Mercian King, whose insupportable Exactions
Cuthbert could not endure. In this Fight Cuthbert had the fortune to overthrow
the Mercian King, and to win his Banner, wherein was depicted a golden Dragon.
The Memory whereof has continued for several Ages in the Custom used here of
making a Dragon yearly, and carrying it about the Town in great Jollity on
Midsummer Eve, with the addition of a Giant to it. At present Burford is a
famons Place for Saddles; and something advantaged besides by the neighboring
Downs, much resorted unto by the Gentry for Horse races. Of late become of
further note, by giving the Title of Earl to the Duke of St. Albans.

Woodstock, a well-compacted Borough-Town, is pleasantly seated near a small
River, on a rising Ground, with a large Park near it, surrounded with a Wall,
and said to be the first enclosed Park. In which was once a Royal House, called
Woodstock Bower, built by King Henry I, and enlarged by Henry II, but
demolished in the long Civil Wars. In this House was born Edward the black
Prince; and in the Labyrinth that belonged to it the beautiful Rosamond, King
Henry the Second's Mistress, catched her Death, by the poisonous Dose the
jealous Queen forced upon her. Whereupon she was interred at a Nunnery called
Godstow, not far from this Town, with this Latin Epitaph, Hac jacet in Tumba
Rosa Mundi non Rosa munda,
Non redolet, sed olet, quae redolere solet.


Tame, so called from the River of that Name, which with its Branches does
almost incompass it, is a pretty large Town, having one spacious Street, and in
the midst of it the Marketplace. Over the River is a Bridge, which leads to
Buckinghamshire, so near this Town is seated to its Borders. Here is a famous
Free School, with a small Hospital, founded by the Lord Williams of Tame, and
its Market is eminent chiefly for the buying of Cattle, which makes it much
frequented by Grasiers and Butchers from London and other Parts.

Bampton, near the Isis, is a large Town, within a larger Parish, having
several Places besides belonging to it. It has a Chapel of Ease, to which
belong 3 Vicars, with a liberal Maintenance.

Banbury, for wealth and beauty the second Town in this County, is seated in a
Flat, on the River Cherwell. Memorable for a great Battle sought near it
between the two Houses of York and Lancaster, which proved so favorable to the
Lancastrians, that Edward the Pretender to the Crown was taken Prisoner in it.
This Town also has been dignified with the Title of an Earldom, first in the
person of William Lord Knolles, created Earl of Banbury, Anno 1626; and
continued in his Son* Nicholas, the late Earl of Banbury. Lastly, in this Town
is made a delicate sort of Cheese, which has added something to its Fame.

Henley stands upon the Thames, over which it has a fair Bridge. It Is a large
Town Corporate, driving a great Trade of Malt. And its Market is so
considerable for Corn, and Barley especially, that there is often sold in one
day about 300 Cart-load of Barley for the Malt-Trade of it. The Barge-Men
besides of Henley, which make up a good Part of its Inhabitants, gain a good
Livelihood by transporting of Malt, Wood, and other Goods to London. From
whence they bring in return such Commodities as they and the Inhabitants of the
neighboring Towns stand in need of.

Witney, seated on the Banks of the River Windrush, and not far from Burford,
is a large straggling Town. Most of whose Inhabitants get a Livelihood by
spinning and carding for Blankets and Rugs, whereof the Clothiers here drive a
good Trade. Here is a Free School for the Education of Youth, with a fine
Library.

Not far from this Town, and near Enisham, is a Monument of huge and unwrought
Stone, called Roll-rich-Stones, set in a circular Compass not unlike those of
Stonehinge, and supposed to be there erected, in memory of some great Victory.
In this Tract of Ground is a Forest of a large extent, called Whitwood-Forest.

At the Confluence of the Them and Isis stands Dorcester. Which indeed is no
Market Town; but, as it is seated on the Road, is well frequented, and
accommodated with Inns. A Town formerly of more note than now it is; when
Berinus, Apostle of the West Saxons, had his Episcopal See here, which was
afterward removed to Lincoln. However it is graced to this day with a very
large and fair Church.

To conclude, Oxfordshire (now in the Diocese of Oxford) was Part of the
ancient Kingdom of Mercia. And its Inhabitants, together with those of
Glocestershire, were known a mong the old Romans by the Name of Dobuni.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, eight Members to
sit in Parliament. Viz. 2 by the University, and 2 by the City of Oxford, 2 by
Banbury, and 2 more by Woodstock.

Rutland.
RVTLAND, another Inland County, and the smallest in England, is bounded East
and North, by Lincolnshire; Westward, by Leicestershire; and Southward, by
Northamptonshire, from which it is severed by the River Weland.

It contains in Length, from North to South, 12 miles; in Breadth, from East to
West, but (...). The Whole divided into five Hundreds, wherein 48 Parishes, and
but 2 Market Towns.

As little as this County is, yet for quality it yields to none of the best,
either as to Air or Soil.

As for the Air, it is temperate, wholesome, and not subject to Fogs.

The Soil exceeding good either for Corn, or Pasture, especially about the Vale
of Catmoss. For, besides its plenty of Corn, it feeds great Herds of Cattle,
and Flocks of Sheep, whose Wool participates of the Color of the Earth, which
is reddish. It Is also well clothed with Wood. and watered with fresh Streams,
the chief among which are the Weland, and the Wash. Lastly, this little County
has more Parks, considering its Extent, than any other County in England.

Okeham, the chief Place hereof, bears from London North North-West, and is
distant therefrom 74 Miles, thus. From London to Bedford, 40, for which see
Bedfordshire; from Bedford to Wellingbury, 12; and to Kettering, 5 more; thence
to Vppingham, 12; and to Okeham, 5 more.

Called Okeham, as some would have it, from the plenty of Oaks that grow in its
Neighborhood; and seated in a rich and pleasant Valley, called the Vale of
Catmoss. Its Buidings are indifferent good, especially the Church, the
Free School, and the Hospital. The Castle, where the Assizes are held, is a
Place of more antiquity than beauty. And its Market, which is on Saturdays, is
indifferently well served with Provisions.

This Town has an ancient Privilege belonging to its Royalty; which is, if any
Nobleman enter within its Precinct on Horseback, he forfeits a Shoe from his
Horse, unless he redeem it by Money. Which Homage has been acknowledged by
several of ^he Nobility that have passed this Way; as is evidenced by many
Horse-Shoes nailed upon the Shire-Hall Door. In which Hall, over the Judges
Seat, is a Horse-Shoe of Iron curiously wrought, 5 foot and a half long, with a
breadth proportionable.

Vppingham, the other Market Town, seated on an Eminence, is a pretty compacted
and well built Town, having the Accommation of a Free School and an Hospital.
Its Market, kept on Wednesdays, is counted better than that of Okeham.

In short, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and
its Inhabitants Part of the Coritani, as the Romans called them) is now in the
Diocese of Peterborough. It is dignified with the Title of an Earldom, now in
the person of the Right Honorable John Manors Earl of Rutland, and Baron
Ross, etc. Derived to him from his Ancestor Tho. Manors, created Earl of
Rutland by King Henry VIII. in the Year 1325, and descended by the Lady Ann his
Mother from Richard, second Son of Edmund of Langley Duke of York.

Out of this County are only elected the two Knights of the Shire, to serve in

Of Shropshire, Somersetshire, and Staffordshire.

Shropshire.
SHROPSHIRE, or Salop, an Inland County, is bounded on the East with
Staffordshire; on the West, with the Welsh Counties of Denbigh and Montgomery;
on the North with Cheshire, and on the South, with Herefordshire.

Its Length, from North to South, is about 35 miles; its Breadth, from East to
West, 26. The Whole divided into fifteen Hundreds, wherein 170 Parishes, and 15
Market Towns.

Here the Air is counted very wholesome, and the Soil as fruitful, both for
Corn and Pasture. It Is well clothed with Wood, and in the Bowels of the Earth
are Mines of Iron and Pitcoal in great plenty. But, toward the West and South
Parts, the Country is very hilly, and mountainous.

As for fresh Streams, no County is better watered than this. For, besides the
Severn, which in its crooked and winding Course, cuts the Shire in the midst,
here are the Roden, the Terne, Clum, Rea, and Teme. In all which are plenty of
Fresh Water Fish.

And, as this County is inferior to none about it, either for delight or
penty; So for the Number of Towns and Castles, standing exceeding thick on
every side (as having formerly been a Frontier-County toward Wales) it is far
above 'em.

Shrewsbury, the chief Place hereof, bears from London North-West and by West,
and is distant therefrom 124 miles, thus. Viz. From London to St. Albans, 20;
and to Dunstable, 10 more; thence to Stony-Stratford, 14; to Towcester, 6; and
to Daventry, 10 more; from thence to Covenrry, 14; and to Bermingham, 14 more;
then to Dudley, 8; to Bridgenorth, 12 more; from Bridgenorth to Wenlock, 6; and
from thence to Shrewsbury, 10.

It Is seated in the very midst (or Center as it were) of the County, on a
pleasant Ascent, and on the Banks of the Severn, not far from the Place where
stood Vriconium, out of whose Ruins it is said to be raised. The Severn does
almost incompass it round; and that Part of it which is not fenced with it is
fortified with a strong Castle, built by Roger de Montgomery, the first Earl
hereof. A Town which, for neatness of Buildings both public and private, for
variety and fineness of Streets, for extent and populousness, yields to few
Cities in England It contains five Parish-Churches, two of which (viz. St.
Marie's and St. Alchmond's) are fair Structures, and beautified with lofty
Spires. And here are still to be seen the Remains of a stately Abbey, founded
by the foresaid Earl of Montgomery. Besides the natural Strength of this Place,
it is fenced about with a strong Wall, with a Bulwark ranging from the Castle
unto (and part along) the Severn. On the East and West there are three
Entrances into the Town by two fair Stone-bridges, with Gates, Towers, and
Bars; and on the North, by a Gate, over which stands the Castle, once exceeding
strong. Remarkable besides for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable
Charles Talbot, the present Earl of Shrewsbury. In short, it is a well-traded
and frequented Town by all sorts of people, both English and Welsh, whose
frequent Intercourse brought them to speak both Speeches. The principal Trade
they drive here is in Cloths, Frizes, Welsh Cottons, and some other
Commodities, this being the common Mart or Empory between England and Wales.
And here are Weekly 3 Markets, Viz. On Wednesdays for Provisions, on Thursdays
for Welsh Cottons, etc. (here sold in great abundance, and thence sent to
London,) on Saturdays for all sorts of Provisions.

The other Market Towns are Bridgenorth, Sat. Newport, Sat. Ludlow, Mund. Great
Wenlock, Mund. Oswestree, Mund. Ellismeer, Tue. Shipton, Tue. Drayton, Wedn.
Wem, Thu. Wellington, Thu. Stretton, Thu. Whitechurch, Frid. Bishops Castle,
Frid. Clebury,


Among which Ludlow, seated in the South Parts of the County, upon the Banks of
the Teme, is the most considerable. The Town is large, and populous; beautified
with many fair Edifices. It is also defended by a Wall and a Castle, both built
by Earl Roger of Montgomery.

But it is of chief note, for being the Place where the Court for the Marshes
of Wales were kept, first ordained by King Henry VIII. for the Trial of Causes,
but suppressed in the late Session of Parliament.

Bridgenorth, or the Borough of Bruges, is situate upon the Severn, over which
there is a fair Stone Bridge. It Is a good large Town, divided into two Parts,
the one called the Upper, the other the Lower Town, containing two Parish
Churches. In former time fortified with Walls, a Ditch, and a stately Castle
seated on a Rock, now decayed.

Drayton, on the River Terne, where it severs this County from Staffordshire,
is a Place of some note for a Battle there fought betwixt the Houses of York
and Lancaster.

Newport lies South of Drayton, on a Plain or Flat adjoining to Staffordshire.
Great Wenlock, in the Road from Worcester to Shrewsbury. Bishops Castle, in the
South Parts, not far from the River Clun. Wem, on the Roden, in the North Parts
of the County; noted for the Title of Baron it lately gave to the Lord
Chancellor Jeffreys. Oswestree and Ellismore, near the Borders of Wales.
Whitechurch, on the Confines of the County near Cheshire.

At Wenlock, in the Time of Richard the Second, was found a rich Copper Mine.
And at Pitchford in this County is a Well, or Spring, in a private Man's Yard,
wherein flow's a thick Scum of liquid Bitumen; which being cleared and taken
off one day, will have the like upon it again the next.

Alderbury, though no Market Town, is famed for being the Birthplace of old
Thomas Parre, who lived to a great Age, and about two years before he died was
brought up to London to King Charles I. Where he died, and lies buried in
Westminster Abbey. He was born Anno 1483, died in the Year 1635, lived 152
Years, and saw ten ^eigns.

Lastly, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and its
Inhabitants part of the Cornavii, as the Romans called them) stands now divided
betwixt the Dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, ten Members of
Parliament. Viz. two out of each of these following Towns, Shrewsbury, Ludlow,
Great Wenlock, Bridgenorth, and Bishops-Castle.

Somersetshire.
SOMERSETSHIRE, a large Maritime County in the West of England, is so called
from Somerton, once the most famous and most considerable Town in all the
County, and now but a small Market Town of little or no credit.

It Is bounded on the East by Wiltshire and part of Devonshire; on the West, by
Devonshire; Northward, by the Severn Sea, and part of Glocestershire;
Southward, by the Counties of Devon and Dorset.

Its Length, from East to West, is about 55 miles; its Breadth, from North to
South, 40. The Whole divided into 42 Hundreds, wherein 385 Parishes, and 30
Market Towns.

The Air of this County, in the Summer Season, is very agreeable; but, in
Wintertime, it is apt to be too moist and foggy.

Accordingly the Soil in Winter is wet, miry, and moorish, especially in the
midst of the Country, which makes the Roads very uneasy to Travelers. But in
Summer there is no pleasanter Country, being garnished (as it is) with rich
Pastures and delightful Meadows. Which has given occasion to an usual Proverb
here, that what is worse for the Rider is best for the Abider.

And, besides Corn and Cattle, wherewith this Country is plentifully stored,
here are insome Parts, especially toward Wiltshire, rich Lead-Mines, to the
great benefit not only of the County, but of the whole Kingdom. These Mines are
found particularly in the Hills called Mendip-Hills; of no small Profit to the
Owners.

As for its Diamonds, commonly called Bristol-Stones, I refer you to Bristol in
Glocestershire.

Besides the Severns Mouth, whereby the North-West Part of this Country is
watered, here is the Avon, which parts this County from Glocestershire, the
Parret, the Tor, Tone, From, and others, well stored with excellent Fish.

In this County are three Cities, Bristol, Bath, and Wells. Bristol indeed
stands also in Glocestershire; and, as I have already described it there, I
shall pass it over here.

Bath bears West and by South from London, and is distant therefrom 94 miles.
Viz. from London to Reading, 32 miles, as you may see in Parkshire; from thence
to Newbery, 15; and to Marlborough, 15 more; thence to Chipenham, 15; and to
Bath 13 more.

It is so called from its Medicinal hot Baths, much resorted unto from all
Parts, as being found by long experience to be of great virtue in the curing of
Aches and other Distempers.

Its Situation is on the River Avon, over which it has a Stone Bridge; and
there it lies in a low and small Plain, surrounded with Hills very high and
steep, out of which issue forth several Springs of Water, which pay Tribute to
it. This is a Place of great Antiquity, as does appear by many Roman
Inscriptions and Images commonly found in the Walls which incompass it. And
where the Abbey now stands, it is said there was of old a Temple consecrated to
Minerva, the Goddess of Fountains and Baths. In short, it is a fine City, graced
with wellbuilt Houses; and for divine Worship, hav^^^ a Parish Church, besides
its Cathedral.

The Baths in it are four in number, viz. the Cross, and the hot Bath, in the
West Parts of the City, the King's and the Queen's-Bath, in the middle.

The Cross Bath, so called from a Cross that formerly stood in the midst of it,
is Triangular, about 25 foot long, and as broad at one end. This is of a more
gentle heat than the rest, because it has fewer Springs. About 100 foot from it
is the Hot-Bath, so called, because formerly it was much hotter than the rest,
when it was not so large as now it is.

The King's Bath is about 60 foot square, and has about the middle of it many
hot Springs rising, whence it has the greater heat. The Queen's Bath has no
Spring in it, but only receives the Water from the King's Bath, from which it
is only divided by a Wall; and so it is more temperate than the King's. In
these two Baths is a Pump, to pump Water upon the Diseased, where strong
Embrocations are required.

In every one of the Baths are Seats of Stone, for the convenience of those
that use 'em. But from 8 a Clock in the morning till about 3 in the afternoon,
these Baths are shut up, and none permitted entrance; being then so very hot,
that they work and cast up a filth from the bottom.

The Inhabitants of Bath do not only find a great advantage by these Medicinal
Springs, but also by their Cloth Manufacture, wherein they drive a considerable
Trade. And, for Provisions, they have two Markets a Week, viz. Wednesdays and
Saturdays.

This City is Partner with Wells, the Bishops See, in the Title Episcopal.

Noted besides, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable John
Granvile, created Earl of Bath by King Charles the II. Anno 1661. Which Title
was formerly enjoyed by the Heirs of John Bourchier, who was created Earl of
Bath by King Henry VIII. Anno 1536; but went away from that Family by the Death
of Henry Bourchier, dying without Issue male.

Wells, seated at the foot of a Hill, is so called from the Springs and Wells
that spring about it. It Is a small City, but well inhabited, and adorned with
fair Buildings, both public and private. The Cathedral, among the rest, is a
stately Pile of building, having in the West End a Frontispiece of excellent
Imagery and carved Stone-work; dedicated to S. Andrew, and said to be first
built by Ina, King of the West Saxons. Adjoining to it is the Bishops Palace,
built in the manner of a Castle, and fortified with Walls and a Mote; and on
the other side are the Prebends Houses, etc. The Market-house is also a neat
Building, supported by Pillars. Lastly, this City has two Markets a Week, on
Wednesdays and Saturdays, as Bath.

The other Market Towns are Bruton, Sat. Langport, Sat. Crokehorn, Sat.
Ilmister, Sat. Watchet, Sat. Dulverton, Sat. Chard, Mun. Somerton, Mun.
Glassenbury, Tue. Wivescomb, Tue. Pensford, Tue. Wrinton, Tue. N. Petherton,
Tue. N. Curry, Tue. and Sat. Wincaunton, Wedn. Ilchester, Wedn. Froumselwood,
Wedn. Taunton, Wedn. and Sat. Axebridge, Thu. S. Petherton, Thu. Bridgewater,
Thu. Wellington, Thu. Canesham, Thu. Evil, Frid. Dunster, Frid.
Shepton-Mallet, Frid. Philip-Norton, Minehead,


Among which Bruton, seated on the River Brue, is a well built and inhabited
Town, that drives a good Trade for Clothing, Serges, and Maulting. It Is graced
with a beautiful Church, has a Free School founded by King Edward the Sixth,
and a very fine Almshouse.

Langport stands on the top of a Hill, in a miry and moorish Country, and near
the River Parret, which next to the Avon is the most considerable.

South-Petherton, Crokehorn, Chard, and Ilmister ly not far asunder, near the
West-Borders of Dorsetshire; the first two, on the Banks of the Parret.
Dulverton, on the Ex, borders upon Devonshire.

Wivescomb, Wellington, North Curry, and Taunton are seated on the River Tone.
Taunton, the chief of all the List, is a neat and populous Town, graced with
spacious Streets, and a fine Bridge over the River. Inhabited chiefly by
Clothiers, who drive a considerable Trade with the Cloths and Serges made here,
and in the adjacent Parts. It contains two Parish Churches.

Bridgewater and Glassenbury are the two Places of chief note next to Taunton;
the first seated on the Parret, the laft on the Tor, and each with a
Stone Bridge over its proper River. The first is a large, well-inhabited, and
frequented Town, adorned with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the
Right Honorable John Egerton, the present Earl of Bridgewater. Derived to him
from his Father John Egerton, created Earl of Brigewater by King James I. Anno
1617. Which Title was formerly enjoyed by Henvy Lord Dawbeney, advanced from a
Knight to this Dignity by King Henry VIII; he being Son of that Giles Dawbeney,
who came in with King Henry VII. from Bretagne in France. But he dying without
Issue, this Title died with him; till revived, as aforesaid.

Glassenbury, of old called the Island of Avalon, is of chief note for its once
famous and stately Abbey; the Monks whereof (for the Credit of it) gave it out,
that the Body of Joseph of Arimathea lay there Interred. Certain it is, that
this was a Shelter to the Britains in the latter Times of the British Churches,
when they were miserably harassed and persecuted by the Pagan Saxons And it
might be (as Dr. Stillingfleet says) of far greater request among the Britains,
because it was the Place where King Arthur was buried. Whose Body was found
there very deep in the Earth in the Reign of Henry II, with a Latin
Inscription on a leaden Cross, expressing that King Arthur lay there buried in
the Island of Avalon. And his Body was laid so deep for fear of the Saxons,
this being a Place of Retreat in the British Times, but not without the
apprehension of their Enemies Invasion.

Axebridge is so called from the River Axe, on which it is situate, Pensford
and Canesham ly North and by East from Axebridge; both seated on the Chire, and
the last at its very fall into the Avon, near Bristol. Philip-Norton and
Froumselwood stand near the Froume, on the Confines of Wiltshire.
Shepton-Malles and Somerton ly South and by West from 'em; both pretty large,
but poor Towns. Whereas Somerton (as I said before) was once a Place of such
note, that the Shire took its Name from it.

Ilchester, so called from the River Ill, or Yeovel, upon which it is seated,
is a Town of great Antiquity, and was once a Place of good Strength. Then it
had 16 Parish Churches, now reduced to two. However this is the Place where the
County-Goal is kept. Evil, or Yeovel, stands upon the same River, and grows by
the decay of of its Neighbor Ilchester.

Win^aunton stands on the side of a Hill, in the Road to London; and is a good
Market Town, for Cheese especially.

Minehead, Watchet, and Dunster ly all three by the Seaside. But the first has
the best Harbor, and is a Place of some Trade, especially into Ireland. West
from which, toward Devonshire, stands another Sea-Town called Porlock, noted
for its Bay or Harbor, sometimes resorted unto by Seamen in those Parts.

But, to conclude, this County in general is noted for two Things, besides the
forementioned. The first, for giving the Title of Duke to his Grace, Charles
Seymour, the present Duke of Somerset, Marquess of Hartford, etc. Descended
from Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, and Lord Protector of King Edward the
Sixth, who was beheaded Anno 1552. But, upon the Restoration of King Charles
the Second, the Title was restored to the Line in the person of William
Seymour, the great Grandchild of the foresaid Duke; from whom it is now
devolved to the present Duke, Brother to Francis who was killed in Italy.

It Is remarkable besides, that this County was few Years since the Scene which
brought the late Duke of Monmouth, with many of his Followers, to their
tragical End; and gave an Opportunity to the Popish Party, by the
uncontrollable Authority of the late King James, to hurry on their Design of
Intailing Popery and Slavery upon these Nations. Which was wonderfully
defeated, under God, by the Magnanimity of our present King.

Lastly, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the
West Saxons, and its Inhabitants Part of the Belgae in the Time of the Romans)
is now in the Diocese of Ba^h and Wells.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 16 Members of
Parliament, Viz. Two out of each of these following Places, Bristol, Bath,
Wells, Taunton, Bridgewater, Minehead, Ilchester, and Milburn Port. Which last
stands on the Confines of Dorsetshire.

In the South Parts of this County is a sharp Hill, called Montacute, which
gives the Title of Viscount to the Right-Honourable Francis Brown, the present
Viscount Montacute. Derived to him from Anthony Brown, created Viscount
Montacute in the Reign of Queen Mary, Anno 1354; being descended from the Lady
Lucy, Daughter of John Nevil, Grandchild of Tho. Montacute Earl of Salisbury,
who was created Lord Montacute, and afterward Marquess Montacute, by King
Edward the fourth.

Staffordshire.
STAFFORDSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded Eastward by Derbyshire and part of
Warwickshire, parted from the first for the most part by the River Dove;
Westward, by Cheshire and Shropshire; Northward, by Cheshire and part of
Derbyshire; and Southward, by Worcestershire.

Its Length, from North to South, is at least 40 miles; its Breadth, from East
to West, about 25. The whole divided into five Hundreds, where in 130 Parishes,
and 18 Market Towns.

The Air is counted here pretty good and healthful, but it is somewhat sharp
in Winter.

As for the Soil, it is true the greatest Part of the Country is taken up with
Moors, and Woods; insomuch that one may go the whole length of the County, and
see little but Heaths and Moors. But they are such as yield both profit and
pleasure. Profit, by breeding Multitudes of Sheep, Deer, and Conies; and many
of 'em by the Husbandmans Industry, yielding very good Corn. Pleasure, for they
afford the greatest plenty of Heath-Game of any County in the Kingdom, either
by Hawking or Hunting. And so great was formerly the Number of Parks and
Warrens in this Shire, that there was scarce any Gentleman's Seat in the County
but what had both Park and Warrens. The chief Forests are those of Cank and
Kinvare; and among Chases, those of Needwood, Peasey, and Alderwas Hay.

In short, the North Part of this Country is full of Hills, and Woods, the
South stored with Coals and Mines of Iron, and the middle Part (being watered
with the River Trent) adorned with fair Cornfieldsd and Meadows. And yet in the
North-Parts the Pastures near the River Dove yield the sweetest and fattest
Mutton in England.

For Manuring the Ground, here is plenty both of Lime and Marl. For Building,
abundance of Timber and Stone, which last for its fineness and durableness is
held in good esteem. A sort of Plaster is made of the Lime, which soon after
it is laid, grows as white as Snow, and as hard as a Stone. Here is also a good
deal of Alabaster; and, in some Places, salt Springs, yielding plenty of white
Salt, not much inferior to the best Salt in Cheshire.

The Hills of most note are Mowcop-hill, in the Confines of Cheshire, where
Millstones are got; Dudley-hill, which affords a fine Prospect; the Shaw,
which overlooks the Counties of Darby and Leicester; and the Wever.

With Rivers, Springs, and Brooks, no County in England is better watered than
this. Besides the Trent, here is the Dove, the Churnet, the Blithe, the Line,
the Tean, the Sow, the Penk, the Manifold, and several others; some emptying
themselves into the Dove, as this dees into the Trent, and all of them stored
with most sorts of fresh water Fish. The Trent, of special note for its Pikes,
Pearches, Fels, and Graylings; the Dove, for its Trouts; and the Blithe, for
Eels. And over all these Rivers are reckoned at least 24 Stonebridges.

But as the Gentry here are not so curious in their private Buildings as they
be in other Places, to amongst the numerous Towns that are here few can boast
of any Beauty.

Stafford, the Shire-Town, from whence the County takes its Name, bears from
London North-West, and is distant therefrom 104 miles, thus. From London to
Northampton, 54 miles, for the particulars whereof I refer you to
Northamptonshire; from thence to Coventry, 20 miles; to Lichfield, 20 more; and
thence to Stafford, 10.

A Town pleasantly seated on the Banks of the-River Sow, which washes its
South and West Parts, with a Bridge over it. Formerly fenced with a Wall,
except where it was secured by a large Pool or Water on the North and East.
Here are two Parish-Churches, a free School, and a fine Marketplace. The
Streets are large, and graced with many good Buildings. And its Market, which
is kept on Saturdays, is well served with most sorts of Provisions.

This Town did formerly belong to the noble Family of the Staffords, first with
the Title of Earl hereof and afterward of Lord or Baron. Henry Stafford was
the last of that Line, who dying Anno 1639, the Family of the Staffords died
also with him. But, the next year after, William Howard, Knight of the Bath,
and second Son of Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, having to Wife a Daughter
of the last Lord Stafford, was by King Charles I. created Viscount and Lord
Stafford. Who, being found Guilty of High Treason by his Peers, Dec. 7th 1680,
was beheaded upon Tower Hill Dec. 29. But the Title was in the late Reign
revived in his Son Henry, the present Earl of Stafford.

Lastly, though Stafford be the County-Town, yet it is not the chief, either
for extent or beauty, it being outdone by

Lichfield, a City and County of it self, seated in a low and Moorish Ground,
on a shallow Pool, by which it is divided into two Parts, both joined together
by a Bridge and a Causey, and making up a City of indifferent bigness. In the
South Part, which is the greater of the two, stands a Grammar School for the
Education of Children, and an Hospital dedicated to S. John, for the Relief of
the Poor. In the other Parts there is nothing considerable but a fair Cathedral,
and that sufficient of it self to renoun the Place. First built by Oswin, King
of Northumberland, about the Year 656, who gave the Bishops hereof many
Possessions. Afterward being taken down by Roger de Clinton, the 37th Bishop
of this Diocese, that which now stands was built by him, and dedicated to the
Virgin Mary and S. Chad. Besides the Cathedral, this City has 3 Parish
Churches. And its Weekly Markets, kept on Tuesdays and Fridays, are well served
with Provisions.

But Lichfield is not only honored with a Bishops See. It Is dignified besides
with the Title of an Earldom, in the person of the Right Honorable Edward
Henry Lee, who was created by Charles II. Baron of Spellesbury, Viscount
Quarendon, and Earl of Lichfield, Anno 1674.

The other Market Towns are Newcastle, Mund. Stone, Tue. Betles, Tue. Pagets
Bromley Tue. Tudbury, Tue. Walsall, Tue. Ridgeley, Tue. Penkridge, Tue.
Brewood, Tue. Leek, Wedn. Vtoxeter, Wedn. Wolverhampton, Wedn. Checkley, Thu.
Burton, Thu. Eccleshall, Frid. Tamworth, Sat.


Among which Newcastle, commonly called Newcastle under Line, from the Rivulet
Line upon which it is seated, and that to distinguish it from Newcastle upon
Tine in Northumberland, is a large Town, but mean in its Buildings, most of 'em
being thatched.

Vtoxeter and Tudbury are seated on the River Dove; Stone and Burton, upon
Trent, the first in the Road from London to Chester, and the last famous for
its Bridge leading into Derbyshire; Pagets Bromley, on the Blithe; and
Checkley, on the Teane.

Tamworth is seated on the Tame, where the Auker falls into it, with a
Stone Bridge over each. It stands part in this County, and part in
Staffordshire; one part washed by the Tame, and the other Part by the Auker. In
short, it is a good Town, beautified with a large Church, and strengthened with
a small (but strong) Castle.

Walsall is seated on the top of a high Hill, pretty well built, and driving a
good Trade of Nails, Spurs, Stirrups, Bridle-bits, and Bellows made here in
great plenty.

Penkridge, a Place of good Antiquity, seated near the River Penk, is now only
famous for its Horse-Fair, and chiefly for Saddle-Nags. And Brewood, for that
the Bishops of this Diocese had here their Palace before the Conquest.

Wolverhampton was only called Hampton, till such time as one Vulver, a devout
Woman, enriched the Town with a Religious House. It stands upon a Hill, and has
a Collegiate Church annexed to the Deanery of Windsor. About four miles from
this Place stood the Oak, where the late King Charles took Sanctuary for some
Days after his Defeat at Worcester, till he was conveyed to the House of Mrs.
Jane Lane, who was a chief Instrument in his Conveyance beyond Sea. From whence
this famous Tree came to be called the Royal Oak.

Lastly, this County (formerly Part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and its
Inhabitants part of the Cornavii) is now in the Diocese of Lichfield and
Coventry.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, eight Members of
Parliament. Viz. two out of each of these following Towns, Stafford, Lichfield,
Newcastle under Line, and Tamworth.

CHAP. XV.
Of Suffolk, Surrey, and Sussex.

Suffolk.
SVFFOLK, a large Maritime County, is bounded on the East with the German
Ocean; on the West, with Cambridgeshire; Northward, with Norfolk; and
Southward, with Essex.

Called Suffolk, q. d. Southfolk, in opposition to Norfolk, which lies North
from it.

It contains in Length, from East to West, about 45 miles; in Breadth, from
North to South, where broadest, at least 30. The Whole divided into 22
Hundreds, wherein 575 Parishes, and 30 Market Towns. A strong Argument of its
Populousness.

Here the Air is counted so wholesome, that some London Physicians have
prescribed it for the Cure of their consumptive Patients.

As to the Soil, the Eastern Parts all along the Coast, for five or six miles
Inland, are generally heathy, sandy, and full of blea^ Hills; yet such as yield
abundance of Rye Pease, and Hemp, and feed abundance o^ Sheep. The more Inland
Part, commonly called high Suffolk, or the Wood-Lands, is for the mo^^ part
Clay-Ground, and is husbanded chiefly for the Dairy, this County being noted
for its excellent Butter. The Southern Parts along the Borders of Essex and
Cambridgeshire, are much of the same nature for Wood and Pasture-Ground. But
the Parts about Bury, and to the North-West from thence, are generally
Champain, abounding with excellent Corn of all sorts. And as for Parks, here
are reckoned in this County near upon fifty.

For Rivers, few Counties are so well watered. Besides the little Ouse and the
Waveney, which part it from Norfolk here is the Stoure, which severs it from
Essex, the Orwell or Gippe, the Ore, Blithe, Deben, and Breton, etc.

Ipswich, the chief Place hereof, bears from London North-East, and is distant
from thence 55 miles, thus. From London to Colchester, 43 miles, as you may see
in Essex; and 12 from thence to Ipswich.

This is one of the best and most thriving Towns in England, seated in the
South-East Parts of the County, on the Banks of the Orwell, about 20 miles from
its fall into the Sea. A Place of great Antiquity, formerly walled about by a
Rampire of Earth, which in the Year 991 was thrown down by the Danes; who
grievously harassed these Parts, and some years after came with such a fury,
that they left scarce any thing of Ipswich but the Ruins of its Buildings. But,
that Storm being over, it began in the Normans Time to recover it self. So that
at this present, whether we consider its Extent, Populousness, or Trade, it
yields to very few Cities in England. It reaches a mile in length, and above a
mile in breath, with no less than 12 Parish Churches, which shows its
Populousness.

Within that Compass are several fair Buildings, both public and private; and,
among those, the Place of Judicature, a free School with the Convenience of a
good Library, and for the Relief of the Poor an Hospital. And, as for
Cleanliness, it is counted (next to Bristol) one of the cleanliest Towns in
England. Its chief Trade consists in the Manufacture of Cloth, both Linen and
Woollen, besides Fishing and Ship-building. For Provisions, etc. it has 3
Markets a Week, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. And, to conclude, it is of
some note for being the Birthplace of Cardinal Wolsey, who began here to build
a stately College, bearing his Name to this day. The same gives the Title of
Viscount to his Grace the Duke of Grafton.

The other Market Towns are Orford, Mun. Hadleigh, Mun. Lavenham, Tue.
Mendlesham, Tue. Halesworth, Tue. Bury, Wedn. Iestoft, Wedn. Woodbridge, Wedn.
Haveril, Wedn. Bilston, Wedn. Needham, Wedn. Stow. Market, Thu. Tansdale, Thu.
Saxmundsham, Thu. Swold, Thu. Buddesdale, Thu. Bungay, Thu. Newmarket, Thu.
Iksworth, Frid. Mildenhall, Frid. Clare, Frid. Neyland, Frid. Debenham, Frid.
Dunwich, Sat. Eye, Sat. Sudbury, Sat. Framlingham, Sat. Beckles, Sat.
Alborough, Sat.


Among which Bury, or S. Edmunds Bury, is the most remarkable; being so called
from King Edmund the Martyr, here interred. Who, for not renouncing the
Christian Faith, was shot to death at Hoxon by the Danes, and his Body stuck by
degrees with Arrows. In this Town was erected the first Christian Church by
Sigebert, King of the East Angles, in which King Edmund was buried. And, in
Memory of him, here was erected a most stately Abbey, of which and the Town it
self take this Description from an ancient Author. The Sun, says he, has not
seen a Town more finely or delicately seated, upon the East Ascent of a Hill,
with a River running on the East side. Nor a more stately Abbey, incomparable
either for Magnificence or Revenues, in whose prospect appears rather a City
than a Monastery. So many Gates it has for entrance, and many of them Brass; so
many Towers; and, above all, a most glorious Chuch. Upon which attend three
others, standing all in the same Churchyard, all of them very fine, and of
curious Artifice. The Town, at present, does consist of two Parish-Churches;
the Houses pretty well built; the Market-hill, Fair-stead, and Corn-Cross,
spacious and handsome. And for what remains of the Abbey it self (in whose Yard
stands an old Shire-House) it is far more majestic, than any other Ruins of its
kind. The Market is of special note, for the extraordinary Quantities of Corn
brought to it, for which it is usually the Standard of the Country. Lastly, not
far from this Town was that great Battle fought against King Henry the Second,
where this King had the good fortune to overthrow Robert Earl of Leicester,
with his Rabble of Flemings, who joined with the rebellious Son of King Henry,
the Earl himself and his Wife being taken Prisoners.

Stow-Market and Needham are both seated upon the Orwell. The first, as it
were, in the Center of the County, having a fair Prospect down the River
Eastward. It Is a large and beautiful Town, graced with a spacious Church, and
its Steeple adorned with a huge and lofty Pinnacle, not easy to be parallelled.
The grand Trade of this Town is in Tammeys, and other Norwich Stuffs, this
being the only Town in Suffolk considerable for such Things.

Needham, an ominous Name, drives still a Trade (but less than formerly) in the
Suffolk blue and broad Cloths for Russia, Turkey, and orher Countries. Which
creates spinning Work for the poorer sort of Women, whilst others get a
Livelihood by making of Bonelace.

Debenham, and Woodbridge, are on the River. Deben. The last a large Town,
seated on the East Side of a sandy Hill, watered with several Streams, and
having a pleasant Prospect down the River Deben, which about 12 miles lower
discharges it self into the Sea. Here is a fair Church, with several Monuments
in it. In the midst of its Marketplace is also a fair Pile of brick, in a
Chamber whereof are held the Quarter Sessions for the Liberty of S. Ethelred
and Audry. The Market well traded unto, especially for Hemp. In this Town are
four or five good Docks for building of Ships, most of 'em well employed, and
noted among Seamen for good Workmanship. The Inhabitants, for their part, drive
a considerable Trade by Sea, for which they are furnished with several Ships of
burden. And the principal Commodities they deal in are Butter, Cheese,
Pouldavis, Sackcloth, Planks, etc. besides their refining of Salt.

Orford, a few miles East and by South from Woodbridge, is seated between the
River Ore on the East and a smaller Stream on the West, within two miles from
the Sea. Here is a Church well mounted, but unsightly within; and hard by it
the Ruins of a high close-built Castle. Which, together with the
Church-Steeple, are good Directions to Seamen, as the Light-house at the Ness
is by night.

In the Reign of Henry the Second (says Sir Richard Baker) there was taken
near Orford a Fish in the Shape of a Man, which was kept in the Castle above 6
months. This Fish eat all manner of Meat, but delighted chiefly in Fish. An
Author that comments upon it says very seriously, that he spoke not one Word,
and Reason good, for it was a Fish; and that the People brought him sometimes
to Church, but he never showed any Sign of Adoration, which is no wonder of a
Fish. At length, for want of looking to, this Man-Fish stole into the Sea, and
was never more seen, because (I guess) the Water was his Element.

But here is something more admirable. On the narrow stony Beach, that shoots
Southerly betwixt the Town and the Sea, it is said that in the Year 1555, when
there was a great Dearth, there sprang up among the Meershingle such Quantities
of Pease, that the People gathered of 'em above 100 Quarters; which both abated
the price of Corn, and preserved many from famishing. And at the South Point of
it, there still comes up yearly certain course gray Pease, and good Coleworts
out of the Stone-heaps.

Alborough, another Coast-Town, ly's 2 miles North-East of Orford. Pleasantly
seated in a Dale, between the Sea on the East, a high Hill on the West where
stands a large and old-built Church, and a small River that runs to the
Southward. This is a long, large, and plain-built Town, with mean Houses.
Chiefly noted for its Fishery, for which they have a commodious Key at
Slaughden, a quarter of a mile Southwards; and, along the Beach toward Orford,
Conveniences above other Towns, for the drying of their North-Sea-Fish. A
little North of the Town is a Village, called Thorp, whence several Parts of
the County are served with Lobsters and Crabs.

Saxmundsham lies North of Alborough, and at some distance from the Sea, upon a
small River.

Dunwich, on the Seashore, was the first Bishops See of the East Angles, for
the County of Suffolk. Then a Town capable of that Dignity; now ruinous,
decayed, and for the greatest part worn into the Sea. However it does still
contain two Parish Churches. Fishing of Sprats in Winter, and of Herrings,
Mackerels, Soles, and the like, in their proper Seasons, is the chief
Employment of its Inhabitants, as it is with those of Alborough.

Swold, or Sowold, a few miles more Northward, stands also by the Seaside.
Seated on a pleasant Cliff, the Sea on the East, the Harbor on the South, the
River Blithe with a Drawbridge on the West, and a small Neck of Land on the
North. So that it is almost encompassed with Water, especially at every flood.
And, besides the natural Situation of the Place, which renders it a Town of
good strength, here are planted on the Cliff several Pieces of Ordnance. Its
Bay called Swolds Bay, so famous for Ships to ride in, is chiefly made by the
Shooting forth of Easton Ness, a little North of it, which is the most Eastern
Part of all England.

Lestoft is the most Northern Sea-Town of this County, and a good thriving
Place. Its chief Trade consists in fishing for Cod in the North Sea, and at
home for Herrings, for which it lies most conveniently over against the chief
Herring-Beds.

Beckles and Bungay are both seated on the banks of the Waveney. The first has
two Parish-Churches; and a Grammar School, with ten Scholarships for Emanuel
College in Cambridge. Here the Women's Employ is to knit Worsted Stockings,
whilst at Diss in Norfolk on the other side of the River they employ themselves
in knitting of Silk ones.

Halesworth, Framlingham, and Eye, make a kind of Triangle. The first is a
thriving Town for Retail Trade, dealing much in Linen, Yarn and Sale Cloth.

Framlingham, a good large Town, is seated upon a Clay-hill, near the head of
the River Ore. Defended by a spacious tall Castle of Saxon Work, well walled,
and double ditched on one part, with a large Mere on the other part. This
Castle had once no less than 13 high Towers; and was counted so strong, that
Robert, the rebellious Earl of Leicester against King Henry the Second, took up
his Quarters here. Its Inworks are now much defaced, there being only a large
Dwelling House, a Grammar-School-House, etc; but the Outworks are more like a
Castle, than the Ruins of one.

Eye, a pretty large Market Town, and an ancient Corporation, is situate in a
watery Place. It shows a fair Church, with the Ruins of a Castle, and of an
ancient Benedictine Abbey called S. Peter's. The Women's Employ in this Town is
making of Bonelace. This Corporation is a Peculiar of the Crown, an Honor of
ancient Time, and has been given in Jointure with the Queens of England.

Buddesdale, some miles West of Eye, is but a little Borough-Town, seated
(according to its Name) in a Dale. Here is a Grammar School endowed, with
certain Scholarships assigned to Bennet (or Corpus Christi College) in
Cambridge.

Hadleigh and Lavenham are both seated on the River Breton, and Bilston on a
Rivulet that falls into it. The first a Town of great account formerly for its
Clothing, has a fine Church, which is a great Ornament to it, and is a Peculiar
of Canterbury. Of some note for the Martyrdom of Dr. Tailor, their sometime
famous Minister, who suffered here for his Religion.

But, whereas Hadleigh is seated in a Bottom, Lavenham on the contrary stands
on an Eminence. This also has a comely and spacious Church and Steeple, injoy's
a pretty good Trade, and is something the more frequented for its famous
Lecture.

Bilston, or Bildeston, is noted for its Blues and Blankets. And the Women here
either spin corded Wool for the Clothier, or white Work for the Packer.

Neyland, Sudbury, Clare, and Haverill, are all four seated on the River
Stower. The first, in a rich Bottom, is a good Country Town, noted for its
Clothing, but chiefly for its Bays and Says, wherein the Inhabitants drive a
Trade with London.

Sudbury is a good large Town, having a fair Bridge over the River Stower,
which leads into Essex. It contains 3 Parish Churches, and drives a good Trade
of Clothing; being chiefly noted for Says, as Colchester in Essex for Bays. Of
some Note besides, for giving the Title of Baron to his Grace the Duke of
Grafton.

Clare is a Town of more antiquity than beauty, having nothing to boast of but
the Ruins of a Castle and Collegiate Church, but that it gave both Name and
Title to that noble Family surnamed De Clare, who in their Times were Earls of
Hartford, Clare, and Gloucester. The last of that Name was Gilbert de Clare, who
died Anno 1295. He had a Sister and Coheir, Elizabeth by Name, the Wife of
William de Burg, Earl of Ulster in Ireland, by whom she got a Daughter, their
sole Heir. To this great Heiress Lionel, the third Son of King Edward III, was
married, and upon his Marriage made Duke of Clarence, the Termination of the
Title being only changed, not the Place denominating. And from this Change the
second King of Arms is surnamed Clarencieux, as appertaining formerly to the
Dukes of Clarence.

Besides this first Duke of Clarence, I can find but two more. Viz. Thomas,
second Son to King Henry IV, Lord Admiral, who was slain in France; and George,
Brother to King Ed. ward IV, Lord Constable.

But, in the Year 1624, the first Title of Clare was revived in the person of
John Holles, Lord Houghton, Created Earl of Clare by King James the first. To
whom succeeded John Holles, his eldest Son; then Gilbert Holles, the late Earl;
and upon his Decease, the Right Honorable John Holles, the present Earl of
Clare.

Haveril, on the edge of Suffolk, Essex, and Cambridgeshire, is a small and
plain Market Town not far from the Head of the Stower, adjoining to the Saffron
Grounds. The principal Trade here is Fustians.

As for Newmarket, I refer you to Cambridgeshire.

Mildenhall, a large and populous Market Town, is seated on the Banks of a
River that runs from East to West into the Ouse, almost over against Littleport
in Cambridgeshire. Here is a fair Church, with a very tall Steeple. And its
Market does chiefly abound with Fish and wild Fowl from the Fens. Spinning is
here the principal Employment of the poorer sort of Women.

Iksworth is but a small Market Town, which (according to Cambden) retains in
its Name the Memory of the Iceni, who partly dwelt in this County. In this Town
are yet some Remains of an ancient Priory, founded by Gilbert Blunt, Lord of
the Town; as also of a Guild Hall, where (not many years since) has been dug
up a Pot of Roman Coin, bearing Inscriptions of diverse Roman Emperors.

But, besides the foresaid Market-Tows, there are other Towns in Suffolk, which
upon some account or other do deserve a place here.

Exning, or Ixning, among others, not far from Newmarket, has at least as much
right as Iksworth to claim its Name from the ancient Iceni. This is the Place
which gave Birth to St. Audry, the Virgin Daughter of Anna, King of the
East Angles; who, for her holy Life and Works of Piety, was Canonized for a
Saint. From this Town to Ely, Henry Bishop of Ely made a Causey or high Way.

Brandon, seated upon the little Ouse, over which it has a Bridge, was once a
Market Town, but has lost that Convenience. However it is of some note for
giving the Title of Baron to the Earl of Maclesfield. And, not far from it, is
a noted Ferry, called from hence the Brandon Ferry, where Things come up from
the Isle of Ely.

Euston, some miles from Brandon to the Eastward, is also situate on the Banks
of the little Ouse, and that hard by Fackenham. This indeed is but a small
Place, but (as an Author describes it) finely seated on a Flat, in a fair
Champain Country, for pleasure and delight. Which induced the late Earl of
Arlington to raise a noble Structure there, called Euston-Hall, of
extraordinary Beauty. Adjoining to which is a large Nursery, containing 1560.
Fruit Trees of several sorts; besides artificial Fountains, and a Canal which
makes a pleasant noise as it falls into the River. There is also to be seen a
Grove of near ten thousand Trees, a large Warren, and many other Curiosities.
The Particulars whereof I shall wave, to acquaint the Reader, that upon the
Marriage of the second Son of the Duchess of Cleveland to the only Daughter of
the Earl of Arlington, it pleased King Charles II. that he should receive
Denomination from the noble Seat aforesaid. Accordingly he was created Baron of
Sudbury, Viscount Ipswich, and Earl of Euston Anno 1672; and finally Duke of
Grafton, in the Year 1675.

Off^on, that is Offa's Town, King of Mercia. Who, having treacherously
murdered Ethelbert King of the East Angles (to whose Court he came an invited
Guest, Anno 793.) and thereupon usurped his Kingdom, erected here a small
Castle on a Clay-hill. The Ruins of which are yet apparent, under the Name of
Offton-Castle.

Rendlesham, situate on the River Deben, toward Orford, is noted for being the
Place where Redwald, the first Christian King of the East Angles, kept his
Court. Who, being afterward seduced by his Queen, permitted an Altar to be
placed in the Church for her Heathenish Sacrifices to Devils, together with his
Altar for the Worship of the true God.

Wickham, or Wickham-Market, North of Woodbridge, and upon the same River, is
as big as many Market Towns; though its Market be now lost, by reason of its
Neighborhood to Woodbridge. It Is a Stage-Town upon the Eastern London Road,
and one of those where general and Spiritual Courts are held for the
Archdeacon of Suffolk; to whom the Eastern Part of the County is assigned as
the Western is to the Archdeacon o^ Sudbury. Here is a Spire-Steeple, which
serves as a Sea-mark to Sailors off the Whiting Sand by Orford.

Walderswick, a Sea-Town near Sowolds Bay, has a fine Church and Spire-Steeple,
which shows it to have been a much better Town than it is at present.

Blithborough, a poor decayed Town, not far West from Walderswick, is so called
from the River Blithe, over which it has a Bridge. Here are still to be seen
the Ruins of a Priory, founded by King Henry I; and the Goal for the Division
of Beckles, as a Remembrance of the Session, formerly kept here. Of some note
besides for being the Burial Place of Anna, a Christian King of the
East Angles, slain in the Field by Peuda the Mercian King. The Church is very
handsome still, and that is the only Ornament of this Place.

So much for the Towns of Suffolk. What remains is to acquaint you, that this
County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of the East Angles, and its Inhabitants
part of the Iceni, as the Romans called them) is now in the Diocese of Norwich.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, fourteen Members
of Parliament. Viz. Two out of each of these following Places, Ipswich,
Dunwich, Orford, Alborough, Sudbury, Eye, St. Edmundsbury.

Of this County there have been Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls. And this last
Title lives still in the person of the Right Honorable George Howard, the
present Earl of Suffolk. Devolved to him from his Ancestor Thomas Lord Howard
of Walden, created Earl of Suffolk by King James the I. in the Year 1603.

Surrey.
SVRREY, an Inland County of no great extent, is bounded on the East by Kent;
on the West, by Barkshire and Hampshire; Northward, by Middlesex, from which
parted by the Thames; and Southward, by Sussex.

Called Surrey, from its Situation on the Southside of the River Thames; the
Saxons calling that Rey, which we term a River, and so from Southrey came the
Name of Surrey.

It contains in Length, from East to West, about 35 miles; in Breadth, from
North to South, 25. The Whole divided into thirteen Hundreds, wherein 140
Parishes, and yet but 8 Market Towns.

The Skirts of this County are very rich and fruitful, especially toward the
Thames, where it yields plenty both of Corn and Grass; but the middle Parts are
somewhat hard and barren. From whence the People use to say, that their County
was like a course piece of Cloth, with a fine List.

But what the middle Parts want in Riches they supply with Pleasures, as being
famous for good Air, and well stored with Parks; the Downs affording excellent
Opportunity as well for Horse-races as Hunting.

As for Rivers, besides the Thames aforesaid, here is none of any Note but the
Wey which runs through Guildford, the Mole through Darking, and the Wandle
whose Springhead is at Croydon. All which empty themselves into the Thames,
the first two near Hampton Court, and the last near Richmond.

Guilford, the County-Town, bears from London South-West by West, and (by
common Computation) is distant from it 25 miles, thus. From London to Kingston,
10 miles; from Kingston to Cobham, 7; and to Guilford, 8 more.

A Town no less pleasantly than commodiously seated on the River Wey, which
affords a good Advantage to the Inhabitants in the Conveyance of their Goods in
Barges up to London, much facilitated by the several Landlocks or Sluices on the
said River. In old time it was the Royal Mansion of the English Saxon Kings,
and then a Place of larger extent than now it is. Near the River stand the
broken Walls of an old large Castle; and in the midst of the Town is a Church,
the West End whereof made of arched Work, and imbowed over Head, seems to be
very ancient. In short, the Town is beautiful, well frequented, and full of
fair Inns. It contains 3 Parish Churches; and its Market, which is on
Saturdays, iis well served with Corn, and other Provisions.

As for honourary Titles, the first that had any from hence was Elizabeth,
Viscountels of Kynelmalky in Ireland, Created Countess of Guilford during life
by Charles II. Anno 1660. Then in the Year 1671. the same King conferred the
Title of Earl of Guilford upon John Maitland, the late Duke of Lauderdale in
Scotland. And after them Francis North, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was
advanced to the Peerage, by being made Lord Guilford.

The other Market Towns are Southwark, Sat. Kingston, Sat. Croydon, Sat.
Reygate, Tue. Darking, Thu. Farnham, Thu. Ewel.


Southwark, commonly pronounced Suthrick, stands opposite to the City of London
on the Banks of the Thames. A Place which, for number of Buildings and
Inhabitants, goes beyond most of the Cities in England. But, for its Streets
and Buildings, they are but ordinary, except the broad Street which leads from
the Bridge to St. George's Church. A Street beautified with fair Buildings,
raised from the Ashes of frequent Conflagrations this Place has been afflicted
with. And here the Inhabitants drive a considerable Trade with the whole
County, this being the most convenient Place for the Surrey Carriers that come
up; for whose Accommodation here is Multitude of Inns. The principal Church
here is that of St. Mary over Rey, formerly a Priory of the B. Virgin; Next to
which is St. George's Church. Here is also a famous Hospital, called St.
Thomas's Hospital, founded by the Citizens of London, for the Relief of
impotent Persons. The King's Bench and the Marshalsea are two other noted
Places, and but too well known to many. To which add the Bear-Garden, where
Prizes are fought, and the common People diverted with the Fighting of Dogs
with Bears and Bulls. In short, though this Place be counted Part of London,
and under the Lord Mayor's Jurisdiction; yet it does still enjoy several of its
ancient Privileges peculiar to it self, as holding of Courts within
themselves, and electing of Members of Parliament, etc. And, because it lies in
Surrey, as London does in Middlesex, I thought it not improper to bring i^ into
this List.

Kingston is situate ten Miles South-West from London, on the Banks of the
Thames, over which it has a Bridge leading into Middlesex. A Town heretofore
famous for the Coronation of the Monarchs of the English Saxons, whence it had
the Name of Kingston, or Kings Town, whereas before it went by the Name of
Moreford. And, for Distinctionssake it is called Kingston upon the Thames, to
difference it from Kingston upon Hull in Yorkshire. A Place in former times
well known for its Castle, belonging to the Clares, Earls of Gloucester. And, as
for its present State, it is yet a goodly Town, well accommodated with Inns for
the Reception of Strangers, and of late something advantaged by the King's
Residence in Summer at Hampton Court in its Neighborhood, as it is by the
County-Assizes which are frequently held here.

Croydon is a long Town ten miles South from London. Seated near the
Springhead of the Wandle, which falls into the Thames at Wandsworth; and in a
manner begirt with Hills well clothed with Wood, affording good Game to the
Hunter, and furnishing London with great store of Charcoal. This Town has but
few good Buildings, the Houses in it being for the most part but mean and
ordinary. But it has the advantage of being graced with a fine large Church,
set out with a lofty Steeple, and with a Summer-Pallace of the Lord Archbishop
of Canterbury, Accommodated besides with an Hospital for the Relief of the
Poor, and a Free School for the Education of Youth. From this Town to Farnham
runs the Downs, called Banstead Downs, so noted for Hawking, Hunting, and
Horse-racing. And near the Town is a Bourn, or Stream, the Rising whereof has
been sometimes observed to have been a Fore runner of some public Calamity.

Reygate, a good large Town, is seated in the Vale called Holmes Dale, and is
now of chief note for the great plenty of excellent Fullers Earth which is
dug up in its Neighborhood. Here is an ancient, but ruinated Castle; with a
long Vault under Ground, and a large Room at the end of it, where (if the Story
be true) the Barons met in Council in their War against King John. Near this
Town several Battles have been fought against the Danes, which proved fatal to
them.

Darking is situate on a Branch of the River Mole. Where, at the foot of
White-Hill (on which grow plenty of Box-trees) the said River runs under Ground
for above a Mile, and rises again near Norbury. The Place where it falls in is
therefore called the Swallow.

Farnham seems to take its Name from the great Store of Fern that grows in its
Neighborhood. It ly's on the edge of Surrey toward Hampshire, watered by the
River Wey, and graced with an Episcopal Seat, the usual Residence of the
Bishops of Winchester. Here King Alfred, with a small Power, had the good
fortune to overcome the Danes, of whom he made a great slaughter.

As for Ewel, all I have to say is, that it is but very mean and inconsiderable.

Other Places of Note in this County.
Richmond, among the rest, deserves the precedence. A fair, large, and well
built Town, seatupon an easy ascent, on the Banks of the Thames; Whose pleasant
and healthful Situation has invited so many of the Gentry to be its
Inhabitants. Here King Henry VII. built a stately Palace, which (with Nonsuch
and Otelands, two other ^oyal Palaces in this County) has felt the sad effects
of the Civil Wars in the Reign of Charles I. Here died several of the dearest
Princes that ever England had Viz. King Edward III, the Conqueror of France;
the beautiful Ann, Wife to King Richard the Second, and Daughter to the
Emperor Charles the fourth; the most wise Prince, Henry the Seventh; and the
Wonder of her Sex, the famous Queen Elizabeth.

Lambeth. situate opposite to Westminster, is a large Parish, of chief note for
being the Residence of the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, where he has a fine
Palace. And, though, it is counted unwholsom to live in, yet it is well
inhabited; and the Skirts of it graced with many Gentlemen's and Citizens
Houses. Here Canute, the last Danish King, ended his Days among his Cups.

From Lambeth Westward, you will find along the River Battersea, Putney,
Moreclack, three goodly Towns; and, at some distance from the River, Newington,
Clapham, and Wandesworth. This last on the River Wandle, which drives several
Mills, employed by Londoners; and of late much improved by the French
Protestants that have resorted thither.

Further in the Country you will find Stretham a sweet Place, Micham four miles
West of Croydon, Cheame, and near it Nonsuch. This a Royal Palace, so
delightfully seated among Parks, and built with so much Magnificence and such
rare Workmanship by King Henry the eighth, with delicate Gardens, Orchards and
Groves, that (as Speed says) no County had none such as Nonsuch it self.

Not far from Nonsuch is Epsham, very pleasantly seated, and much resorted unto
in Summer by the Gentry and Citizens of London, for drinking its medicinal
Waters.

Here is also a Place called Effingham, which gives the Title of Baron to the
Right Honorable Charles Howard, Baron Effingham; devolved to him some Years
since, upon the Decease of Charles Howard Earl of Nottingham, and Baron
Effingham.

Blechingly, Gatton, and Haselmere are 3 ancient Borough-Towns, which have the
Election of Parliament Men. Now but small and inconsiderable, but formerly of
good note; especially Gatton, where Roman Coyns have often been dug up.
Haselmere stands on the edge of the County, toward Hampshire.

Chertsey, not far from the Thames, over which it has a Bridge, is a Town of
good antiquity. Here King Henry the Sixth being deposed and made away in the
Tower of London, was Interred without funeral Pomp; but, for his holy Life
being reputed a Saint, was afterward Intombed at Windsor in Barkshire.

At Ockl^y King Ethelwolf, Son to King Egbert, fought a successful Battle
against the Danes. And if Merton be famous for any thing, it is for the Statute
of Merton, here inacted, in the Reign of King Henry the Third.

Lastly, this County (which with Sussex made the Kingdom of the South Saxons,
and whose Inhabitants went under the Name of Regni among the ancient Romans) is
now in the Diocese of Winchester.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, no less than 12
Members to sit in Parliament. Viz. two out of each of these following Towns,
Guilford, Southwark, Reygate, Blechingly, Gatton, and Haselmere.

The same has been, for above 600 Years, dignified with the several Titles of
Duke and Earl. The last of which has belonged to the Dukes of Norfolk above 200
Years.

Sussex.
SUSSEX, a Maritime County, is bounded Eastward with Kent; Westward, with
Hampshire; Northward, with Surrey, and part of Kent; Southward, with the Sea
called the Chan^el.

It contains in Length, from East to West, about 55 miles; in Breadth, from
North to South 20. The Whole divided into six Rapes, called from their
respective chief Places Chichester, Arundel, Bramber, Jews, Pevensey, and
Hestings Rapes. All which, one with another, contain 65 Hundreds, wherein 312
Parishes, and 16 Market Towns.

Here the Air is counted generally good, though subject to Mists and Vapors
arising from the Sea.

The Soil is rich, and such as yields plenty of all Things necessary. The North
Parts, toward Kent and Surrey, are well shaded with Woods, as was all the
Country heretofore, till the Iron-Works consumed them. The Southern Parts,
toward the Sea, lying upon a Chalk or Marl, yield Corn abundantly; with a
delightful Intermixture of Groves and Meadows.

Where the Land is low, as it is in that Part called the Weld, the Ways are so
deep in Winter, that then it is exceeding bad Traveling. But that Part called
the Downs is very pleasant and easy to Travelers.

One would think, that in so large an Extent of Seacoast there should be many
a good Harbor. Whereas it is very thin of 'em; and such as it has are, by
reason of its Shelves and Bo^ks, both dangerous for entrance and uncertain for
continuance.

Here are several good Rivers, (among which Arun is the principal) that make
the Country both pleasant and fruitful, and supply it, as the Sea does for its
part, with abundance of Fish.

And, among Fowl, here is abundance of Wheat-ears, a small Bird about the
bigness of a Lark. Which being in the prime, when Wheat is ripe, exceeds all
others for fatness and daintiness. Fast-bourn, near the Sea, is the noted
Place, where they catch plenty of these Birds.

Chichester, the chief Place of this County, and that which gives Name to one
of the six Rapes, is (by common Computation) 50 miles distant from London, and
bears from it South-West and by South. The Way to it is through Guilford 25
miles, as you may see in Surrey; from Guilford to Godalmin, 3; thence to
^echford Bridge, 11; and to Chichester 11 more.

This City (for it is a Bishops See) is seated in a Plain, on the Banks of the
Levant, which incompasses the South and West Parts, and at a small distance
discharges it self into the Sea. First built by Cissa, the second King of the
South Saxons, where he had his Royal Palace. It contains at this time five or
six Parish Churches, besides its Cathedral. Its Buildings are indifferent; but
it has four spacious Streets, with a fine Marketplace of Stone, and supported
round about with Pillars. The Cathedral is of a circular form, and graced with
a stately Spire, built of Stone. Twice it was almost consumed by a raging fire,
since it was first built by Radulph, the third Bishop here; but was afterward
rebuilt and beautified by Seff^id the second Bishop of that Name. In short,
this City injoy's a pretty good Trade; which might be better, were not the
Haven near unto it choked up. Here are two Markets weekly, kept on Wednesdays
and Saturdays, well served with Corn, Flesh, Fish, and Fowl, and generally all
sorts of Provisions.

Nigh unto this City is the Peninsule, commonly called Selsey Isle, of chief
note at present for the excellent Cockles and Lobsters it yields in great
plenty. But in former times far more considerable, when it was an Episcopal
See, before Bishop Stigand removed it to Chichester in the year 107.

Over against the West of this Peninsule lies a small Island, called Thorney
Isle, from a small Town of that Name in it.

The other Market Towns, besides Chichester, are Horsham, Sat. Jews, Sat.
Shoreham, Sat. Ptworth, Wedn. Steyning, Wedn. Storington, Wedn. Rye, Wed. and
Sat. Arundel, Wed. and Sat. Hastings Wed. and Sat. Battle, Thu. Bright
Helmiston Thu. East-Greenstead, Thu. Midhurst, Thu. Cuxfield, Frid.


Besides Winchelsey and Tarring, whose Market Days I am ignorant of.

Among which Midhurst is in Chichester Rape; Petworth, and Storington, in
Arundel; Horsham, Stening, Shoreham, and Tarring, in Bramber Rape; Cuxfield,
Bright Helmiston, in Jews Rape; East-Greenstead, and East-bourn, in
Pevensey's; Rye, and Battle, in Hastings Rape.

Rye, Winchelsey, Hastings, Bright Helmiston, and New Shoram stand by the
Seaside, Battle, Jews, Stening, Tarring, and Arundel, at some distance from
it; Petworth, more Northward; Horsham and East-Greenstead, the furthest of all
from the Sea, and nearest to Surrey.

Jews, among all these, is the most confiderable, and is therefore the Place
where the Assizes are commonly kept. Seated it is on an Eminence, and on the
Banks of a goodly River; well inhabited by Gentry and Tradesmen, and containing
six Parish Churches. At the River's Mouth is New Haven, some Years since made a
pretty secure Harbor for Ships.

Horsham, a large Borough-Town, is situate near S. Leonards Forest. Its Market
is good for all sorts of Provisions, but Fowl especially, most of which is
bought up by the London Hagglers.

East-Greenstead, near Surrey, and not far from Ashdown Forest, is a goodly
Town, graced with a fair Church, and the Place where the Assizes are sometimes
kept. Called East-Greenstead, in opposition to another lying West-South-West
from it, and therefore called West-Greenstead.

Petworth, but a small Town, is finely seated near two Parks, and not far from
the River Arun. Of chief note for its noble House, formerly belonging to the
Earls of Northumberland, and now by Marriage to the Duke of Somerset.

Arundel stands in a Dale (or Valley) on the Western Banks of the River Arun,
from whence it is called Arundel, by contraction from Arundale. Over the River
it has a Wooden Bridge, and from the Sea it is but a small distance. This is an
ancient Town, noted for its Castle, once of great fame and strength; but far
more famous for the Lords and Earls thereof, than either for its strength or
beauty. A Place in this far different from the rest of England, the Title of
Earl of Arundel being annexed to the Castle and its Lordship, and going along
with the possession of it. Witness the Judgment given in that great Controversy
between Sr. John Fi^z-Allen, being in possession of the Castle, against John
Mowbray Duke of Norfolk, being the right Heir in the nearest degree. Thus it
passed through several hands, viz. the Montgomery's, the Albeneys, and the
Fitz-Allens, till Anno 1604 both Castle and Title came to the possession of
Thomas-Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, and Earl Marshal of England. From
whom is descended in a right Line the present Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Arundel,
etc.

Rye, a Member of the Cinque Ports, stands on the edge of the County toward
Kent, and at the very fall of the Rother into the Sea, where it has a
commodious Haven. It Is not a Town of any beauty. But, as it stands convenient
for a ready Passage over Sea to Normandy, and particularly to Diepe, it is upon
that account much frequented in Time of Peace. Its Inhabitants are for the most
part Fishermen, who fish here excellent Herrings.

Winchelsey stands near the Place where stood another of that Name, which in
the Year 1250, was swallowed up by the raging Sea; being a large, strong, and
beautiful Place, in which were numbered 18 Parish Churches. Whereas the present
Winchelsey consists but of one Parish, and that going still to decay, insomuch
that its Markets are in a manner disused. It Is seated upon an Inlet of the Sea,
in the Neighborhood of Rye. But its Haven long since so choakt up, that the
Town suffers much by it, Rye having got the advantage of it. However it is
still a Member of the Cinque Ports; and what it lost in Wealth it has got in
Honor, being advanced to the Reputation of an Earldom, first in the person of
-- Finch, Viscount Maidstone, created Earl of Winchelsey by King Charles I,
Anno 1628. The Title from him devolved to his Son Thomas, after him to Heneage
the late Earl; and lately to his Son and Heir, the Right Honorable Thomas
Finch, the present Earl of Winchelsey.

Battle is seated in a dirty part of the Country, some miles West from
Winchelsey. A noted Place for the Battle fought here Oct. 14. 1066. betwixt
King Harold II. and William the Conqueror; where Harold lost his Life, and
William obtained the Crown of England. After which the Conqueror built an
Abbey here, called Battel-Abbey.

Hastings, one of the Cinque Ports, is a Town of good note and antiquity. It
has two Streets, extending from North to South; and in each Street, a
Parish Church. Its Haven is fed by a small River, and had once for its Defense
a strong Castle seated on a Hill; which, as ruinous as it is, serves in the
Night as a Direction to Sailers, by the Lights that are there placed.

But, besides the said Market Towns, which are the most considerable, Pevensey
and Bramber ought to find a place here, as giving the Denomination to two of
the six Rapes. The first (commonly pronounced, for shortness sake, Pensey) is
the very Harbor, where William the Conqueror landed from Normandy, with 896
Ships, such as they were in those Times.

Buckhurst, a Town in the North-East Parts of this County, is of some Note, for
giving the Title of Earon to the Earl of Dorset.

To conclude, this County (now being in the Diocese of Chichester) made up with
Surrey the Kingdom of the South Saxons, and its Inhabitants were part of the
Regni, as the Romans called them.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 24 Members of
Parliament. Viz. two out of each of these following Towns, Chichester, Horsham,
Midhurst, Jews, New Shoreham, Bramber, Skeyning, East-Greenstead, Arundel;
besides these three Cinque-Port Towns, Hastings, Winchelsey, and Seaford.

As for honourary Titles, it has been for several Ages dignified with that of
an Earldom, 1. in the House of Albeneys, 2. in two Plantagenets, 3. in six
Ratcliffs, 4. in two Savils; and now in the Right Honorable Thomas Leonard,
who upon his Marriage with Anne Fils-Roy, eldest Daughter to the Duchess of
Cleveland, was by King Charles II. created Earl of Sussex Anno 1674.

CHAP. XVI.
Of Warwickshire, Westmorland, and Wiltshire.

Warwickshire.
WARWICKSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded on the East by the Counties of
Leicester and Northampton; on the West, by Worcestershire; on the North, by
Staffordshire; on the South, by the Counties of Oxford, Gloucester, and
Worcester.

Its Length, from North to South, is something less than 40 miles; its Breadth,
from East to West, about 30. The Whole divided into sive Hundreds, wherein 158
Parishes, and 15 Market Towns.

Here both the Air is wholesome, and the Soil rich, especially the South Parts of
it, called Feldon. Which affords rich Meadows, feeds store of Sheep and Cattle,
and is exceeding grateful to the Husbandman in its Crops of Corn. The North
Parts, formerly called Arden, and since Woodland, from its great plenty of
Woods (though at this time much wasted by reason of its Iron Mines) are not
altogether sofruitful as the Southern Parts.

It is generally well watered with fresh Streams; the principal of which is the
Avon, which with many windings and turnings runs through the Country, and
falls at last into the Severn.

Warwick, the Shire-Town, from whence the County took its Name, bears from
London North-West, and is distant therefrom 70 miles, thus. From London to
Buckingham 44 miles, as you may see in Buckinghamshire; from thence to Banbury,
10; to Kyne^on, 8 more; and to Warwick, 8 more.

It Is seated on the Banks of the River Avon, over which it has a well compact
Stone Bridge. A Town adorned with very fair Houses, spacious and well ordered
Streets, with a fine Market-house of Freestone, sustained by several Pillars.
It contains two fair Parish-Churches, of which S. Mary's is the chief. Here is
also, for the Education of Youth, a free School; and, for decayed Gentlemen, a
well endowed Hospital. But the chief Beauty of it, as heretofore so now, is a
most stately and magnificent Castle, the Seat of Sir Fulk Grevill, the late
Lord Brooks, by whom it was repaired at his great cost and charges. In short,
this Town injoy's a good Trade, chiefly for Malt; and the rather as being the
Place where the Assizes and general Sessions for the County are kept. Its
Market, which is kept on Saturdays, is great, and well furnished with all sorts
of Provisions.

But that which has added the most Luster to this Town is the honourary Titles
wherewith it has been dignified for several Ages. Of Earl, first in the person
of Henry de Newburg, Created Earl of Warwick by Wisliam the Conqueror, Anno
1076; and continued in five more of his name, viz. Roger, William, Waleran,
Henry, and Thomas de Newburg. From whom it passed through several Families,
either by Marriage or Blood allied to the former. Till at last the Title of
Earl was by King Henry VI, turned into that of Duke in the person of Henry
Beauchamp, who was made and crowned King of the Isles of Wight, Jersey, and
Garnsey, and soon after created Duke of Warwick.

It Is true the Title of Duke went no further, and that of Earl was renewed in
the person of Richard Nevil, who married Ann the Duke's Sister. From him it
went to George, Duke of Clarence, who married Ann Daughter of Richard Nevil;
and from George, to Edward Plantagenet, his Son. From these it came to two Dud
eyes successively, to wit John and Ambrose, descended from the Lady Margaret,
Daughter of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. And in the Year 1618. King
James I. conferred it upon Robert, Lord Rich of Leeze; in whose Line it
continued, till Charles his great Grandson died without Issue. Upon whose
Death, Robert Rich Earl of Holland, his Cousin german, succeeded in the Earldom
of Warwick, and so enjoyed both Titles. Which fell by his Death to his Son, the
Right Honorable Edward Rich, the present Earl of Warwick.

Near Warwick is a Cliff, most delectably seated among Groves and fresh
Streams; and called Guy-Cliff, from the Hercules of England, Guy of Warwick.
Who, having left off his noble and valiant Exploits, betook himself (as the
Story says) to this Place, where he led a kind of Hermetical Life, and built a
Chapel wherein he was interred.

But, though Warwick be the County-Town, and a considerable Place upon other
accounts; yet here is another of greater importance, which therefore does
deserve a particular Description in this place, before we proceed to the List
of the Market Towns. And that is

Coventry, a City so called from an old Convent (or Monastery) founded by King
Canute. It stands upon a small Stream, called Sherborn, which joining with
another Stream runs not far from thence into the River Avon. It Is a fair, neat,
and large City; beautified with handsome Houses, and spacious Streets, besides a
Cross of curious Workmanship, and its two Churches of St. Michael and of the
Holy Trinity that are loftily built. It was formerly begirt with a fine Wall,
with 13 Gates giving entrance into the City; and what with the Convent and the
translating the Sea Episcopal from Lichsield hither it grew exceeding rich and
wealthy. It Is true now it has neither Convent nor Episcopal See, more than in
the Ruin and Title; and yet it does still continue its old Wealth, being the
best City for Trade in all these Parts, and more than ordinarily frequented for
an Inland Town. Among other its Manufactures, here are great quanti^ies of
Cloths made and vended. And its Market for Provisions is kept on Fridays.

It belonged once unto the Earls of Chester, and after wards by many
Conveniances to John of Eltham Earl of Cornwall, whereby it became annexed to
that Earldom. Nor did it lose any thing, but rather gain much, by that
Annexation; Henry the VI, laying unto it several adjacent Towns and Villages,
and making it with them a County Corporate, clearly distinct from that of
Warwick. Thus Coventry, though within the Confines of Warwickshire, became
exempted from its Jurisdiction. And, in the very first Year of the Reign of
William the Conqueror, it was honored with the Title of an Earldom in the
Person of Edwin a Saxon, with whom the Title died, and lay buried till the
Reign of King James I, when George Villiers (the late Duke of Buckingham's
Father) was created Duke of Buckingham, and Earl of Coventry, Anno 1623.

The other Market Towns are Shipton, Sat. Rugby, Sat. Tamworth, Sat. Nun-Eaton,
Sat. Henley, Mun. Southam, Mun. Sutton Cofield, Mun. Aulcester, Tue. Kyneton,
Tue. Atherston, Tue. Coleshill, Wedn. Stratford, Thu. Bromicham Thu.


Among which Stratford, seated upon the Avon, is one of the prsncipal; it being
a good Town, well inhabited, and driving a good Trade of Malt. It contains two
Parish Churches, and has over the River a fair Stonebridge with several Arches.

Tamworth stands part in this County, and part in Staffordshire, where you will
find it described.

Aulcester is seated on the Confluence of the Alne and the Arrow, and not far
from their fall into the Avon; Shipton, on the Stower; Coleshill, on the Cole;
Kyneton, on a small River that runs into the Avon; Rugby, upon the Avon;
Nun-Eaton, and Atherston, near the Auker; Henley, on the Alne; and Bromicham,
on the Rea. Among which Henley is called Henley in Arden, to distinguish it
from Henley in Oxfordshire.

Bromicham is a large and well built Town, very populous, and much resorted
unto; particularly noted, few years ago, for the counterfeit Groats made here,
and from hence dispersed all over the Kingdom. It drives a great Trade of Iron
and Steel Wares, Saddles, and Bridles; which find good vent at London, Ireland,
and other Parts.

But, besides those Market Towns, there are three Places, Shughury, Lemington,
and Menham Regis, of note for some particular Things. The first, for the
Astroits, or Star-Stones, found about it. Lemington, for two Springs of Water
that issue out there within a stride of each other; but of different taste and
operation, the one being fresh, and the other salt, though at a great distance
from the Sea. Menham Regis, for a Spring, the Water whereof looks and tastes
like Milk. If drunk with Salt, it loosens; if with Sugar, it binds the Body.
Said to be Sovereign against the Stone, good to cure green Wounds, Ulcers, and
Imposthumes, and apt to turn Wood into Stone.

To conclude, this County (which formerly was part of the Kingdom of Mercia,
and its Inhabitants part of the Cornavii, as the Romans called them) is now in
the Diocese of Lichsield.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but four Members
to sit in Parliament; Viz. 2 by Warwick, and 2 by Coventry.

Westmorland.
WESTMORLAND, one of the worst Counties in England, lies in the North-West; and
is called Westmorland, as lying among Moors and Fells (or high Hills) for the
most part unmanured.

It Is bounded on the East with Yorkshire, and the Bishopric of Darham; on the
West and North, with Cumberland; and on the South, with Lancashire. Which last
does so interfere with Westmorland, along the Seacoast, that this County has
but one Corner to peep out upon the Sea; which is about the Place where the Ken
falls into it.

It contains in Length, from North to South, about 35 miles; its Breadth, from
East to West, about 25. The Whole divided into four Wards, called Kendale,
Lensdale, East, and West Wards. Wherein are contained 26 Parishes, and 8
Market Towns.

This County is very hilly, there being two several Ridges of high Hills, that
cross the Country as far as Cumberland. However it has, especially in the
Southern Parts, many fruitful Valleys, with good Arable, Meadow, and
Pasture-Grounds.

The Air, by reason those Hills and the Northern Situation of the Country, is
very sharp and piercing, and not so subject to the Fogs as many other Counties.
Whereby the People are very healthful, free from strange and infectious
Diseases, and commonly live to a great Age.

As for Rivers, this County is very well watered. The principal of which are
the Eden, the Can, or Ken, the Lon, and the Eamon. The Can, of some note for
its two Cataracts, or Water-falls, near Kendall, where the Waters descend with
a great fall and noise. From which the Country People have made this
Observation, that when the North Waterfall sounds clearer and louder than the
other, it is a certain presage of fair Weather. But, when the other does so,
they expect rainy Weather.

Here are also two noted Lakes, or Meers, the one called Vlles Water, and the
other Winder (or Wimander) Mere; the first bordering both upon Cumberland and
Westmorland, and the last upon this County and Lancashire, where you will find
it described.

Kendall, or Candale, the Shire Town, from whence one of the Wards (or
Divisions) has the Name of Kendall Ward, bears from London North-West and by
North, and is distant therefrom 201 miles, thus. From London to Lancaster, 181
miles, the particulars whereof you may see in Lancastire; and from Lancaster to
Kendall, 14.

It is seated in a Dale, on the River Ken, whence it had the Name; built in the
manner of a Cross, two long and broad Streets thwarting one another, besides
some by-Streets. The same is a rich, populous, and well-traded Town; especially
for the making of woolen Cloth, Druggets, Serges, Hats, and worsted Stockings,
whereby the poor people are employed, and the adjacent Parts enriched. Over the
River it has two fair Stone-Bridges; besides another of Wood, which leads to
the Ruins of a Castle, the Birthplace of Queen Catherine, the sixth Wife to
King Henry VIII. Here is a fair and large Church, to which (as the
Parish Church) belong 12 Chapels of Ease. And by the Churchyard stands a
Free School, being a large Building, well endowed with good Exhibitions for
poor Scholars, going from hence to Queens College in Oxford. Here are also in
this Town seven Companies, viz. the Mercers, Shearmen, Cordwainers, Tanners,
Glovers, Tailors, and Pewterers, having their respective Halls for managing
their Concerns. And, for Provisions, here is a great Market, which is kept on
Saturdays.

Lastly, this Town is an ancient Barony. Noted besides for giving the Title of
an Earl to John Duke of Bedford, Regent of France; and to John de Foix, created
Earl hereof by King Henry VI.

The other Market Towns are Appleby, Sat. Burton, Tue. Burgh, Wed. Ambleside.
Wed. Orton, Wedn. Kirby Lonsdale, Thu. Kirby Stephens, Frid. Fardondyke, --.


Among which Appleby, Kirby Stephens, Burgh, and Orton are in East Ward; Kirby
Lonsdale, and Burton, in Lonsdale Ward; Ambleside, in Kendale Ward.

Appleby, the Abellaba of the ancient Romans, is memorable for its Antiquity.
It Is pleasantly seated on the Banks of the River Eden, over which' it has a
Stone Bridge; and does chiefly consist of one broad Street, rising from North
to South with an easy ascent. In the upper Part of it stands a Castle once of
good Strength, in the nether end the Church, and not far from it a free School.
In the East side of the Street leading to the Castle is an Amls-House (or
Hospital) founded and liberally endowed by the Lady Clifford. Where, about the
Year 1652, she placed a deceased Minister's Wife, with her 12 Daughters,
whereof eleven Widows, and the twelfth a maimed Maid. She also purchased Lands
(which she settled upon Feoffees in Trust) for the Repairing of the Church then
very ruinous, the School-House, the Moot (or Town) Hall, and the Bridge, as
Occasion required. In this Town the Assizes and Bessions are usually held.

Kirby Lonsdale, that is, the Church-Town in Lonsdale, is seated on the Banks
of the River Lon, in the pleasant and rich Vale of Lonsdale, toward
Lancashire. A large, and wellbuilt Town, well inhabited and resorted unto,
being the greatest Town in the County, except Kendale. Beautified with a fair
Church, and a large Stone-Bride, and driving a good Trade for Cloth. This Place
gives Name to one of the four Divisions of the County, from hence called
Lonsdale Ward, of some note besides, for the many deep and hollow Caves near it.

Kirby Stephens, a goodly Town, is seated in East ward, near the Skirts of the
Hills which sever this County from Yorkshire. Beautified with a fair Church,
and much improved by the Trade of making Stockings. Near this Town is
Wharton-Hall, a Seat belonging to the Lord Wharton.

Burton, an indifferent Town, stands in a Valley, near the great Hill called
Farleton-Knot-Hill. And Orton, among the Heaths, is so destitute of Wood, that
the people say, they have not so much as a Stick to hang a Dog on.

I pass by the other Towns, as inconsiderable, to take notice of the
Stone-Cross upon Stainmore-Hill, a Hill so called for its being exceeding
stony, Stain in the North being the Word used for a Stone. The Cross said to be
erected upon a Peace concluded between William the Conqueror and Malcolm King
of Scotland, with the Arms of the King of England on the South Side, and those
of the King of Scotland on the North-side. Which served for a Boundary, as the
Case stood then, betwixt the two Kingdoms.

In the North-West Parts, at the joining of the River Eamont with the Lowther,
is Whinfeld Forest, and hard by it, Brougham-Castle, which by the Coyns etc.
that have been there dug up seems to have been a Place of good account in
the time of the Romans.

By the Highway side, leading between Lowther and Eamont Bridges, is a large
Circle of Ground with a fair Plain in the midst. Which the Country People give
out to be the Place made use of by the Knight of the Round Table for their
Tilts and Tournaments, there being two opposite Passes to make their Approaches
in. And accordingly they call it King Arthur's Table.

At Shap, a great Parish, stood the only Abbey in this County, founded by
Thomas Son of Jospatrick, in the Reign of Henry I^ and seated near the River
Lowther. Not far from which is a Well, or Fountain, which ( Euripus-like) ebbs
and flow's many tim^; in a day.

In the same Place are Stones like Pyramids, some of them 9 foot high and 14
thick, pitched directly in a Row for a mile together, and placed at equal
distances from each other.

On the Banks of the Lowther is Lowther-Hall, the Seat of Sir John Lowther
Baronet. Whose Family has there flourished so long a time, that they reckon 30
Descents lineally from Father to Son, and the greatest part of 'em Knights.
Neither does the House only carry the Name of the Family, but also the Park
belonging to it, the Parish, and (which is remarkable) the very River, with the
Bridge over it.

To conclude, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of the Northumbers,
and its Inhabitants part of the Brigantes, as the Romans called them) stands
now divided betwixt the Dioceses of Chester and Carlisle.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, but two Members
of Parliament, and Appleby has the Right of Election.

As for honourary Titles, this County began to be dignified with the Title of
an Earldom in the Reign of Richard II. By whom Ralph Nevil, Lord of Raby, and
Earl Marshal, was created Earl of Westmorland, Anno 1398. Which Title continued
in his Family almost 200 years, till it failed by the Death of Charles Nevil,
in the Year 1584. But it was revived by King James I. in the person of Francis
Fane, eldest Son of Mary, descended from the said Nevils; who was treated Earl
of Westmorland, and Baron of Burghersh, Anno 1624. From whom it passed to
Mildway-Fane, and from him to the Ri^ht Honorable Charles Fane, the present
Earl of Westmorland.

Wilishire.
WILTSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded on the East with Barkshire and
Hampshire; on the West, with Somersetshire; Northward, by Glocestershire; and
Southward, by Dorsetshire.

Called Wiltshire from Wilton, once the chief Town of it; as this is from the
River Willy, upon which it is seated.

It contains in Length, from North to South, at least 40 miles; in Breadth,
from East to West, 30. The Whole divided into 29 Hundreds, wherein 304
Parishes, and 23 Market Towns.

A Country not only pleasant and delightsom, but withal very plentiful. Its
Northern Part, called North Wiltshire, has very pleasant Hills, and well
clothed with Woods. The Southern Parts are more even, and yield plenty both of
Grass and Corn. But the Middle Parts, called the Plains, are most scant of
Corn. Yet as they are wonderful large and spacious, reaching round about to
the Horizon, they feed such innumerable Flocks of Sheep, that the Inhabitants
find a^ much profit by their Fleece, and the gainful Trade of Clothing, as
others do by their more fertile Grounds.

As for Rivers, here is the Isis, which with the Tame makes up the Thames. The
Kennet which runs Westward from this County through Barkshire into the Thames.
The Avon (a Name common to many English Rivers) which runs from North to South,
and then bending its Course to the Westward fal^ into the Severn not far from
Bristol. Another Avon, which takes its Course Southward, and having washed
Salisbury runs on through Hampshire, where it falls near Christchurch into the
Sea. The Willy and the Nadder, which joining together into one Stream at
Wilton, near Salisbury, fall there into the Avon. Besides several lesser
Streams, among which is the Deverill, which runs a mile under Ground.

Now, before I proceed any further in my usual Method, it will not be improper
to take notice in this Place of two Remarkable Things in this County, viz. the
Wansdike, and Stone-henge.

The first is a Dike running for many miles from West to East in the midst of
this Shire, and which (according to the vulgar Opinion) was cast up by the
Devil upon a Wednesday, from whence the Name of Wansdike. But, as Cambden
observes, it was rather made by the West Saxons, for the dividing of their
Kingdom from that of the Mercians; this being the Place where they usually
fought, in order to stretch the Bounds of their Dominions.

Stone-henge, the greater Wonder of the two, and indeed the most admirable
Rarity this Island affords, is a stupendous Piece of Work. It consists of huge
Stones, standing upright in three Ranks round like a Crown, and laid overthwart
one another; some of which are 28 foot high, and 7 broad. Now the Question is,
how these Stones came hither. For the whole Country round for some miles hardly
affords a Stone, either great or small; and these seem too vast to be brought
hither by Wagon, Cart, or any other Artifice. Cambden therefore is of Opinion,
that they were made there by Art, of pure Sand and some unctuous Cement, the
Ancients having had the Art of making Stone. Thus the Cesterns of Rome were
made of Sand dug out of the Ground, which with the strongest kind of Lime
wrought together became so hard, that they seemed Stones.

Salisbury, the chief Place of this County, is reckoned 70 miles
West-South-West from London, thus. From London to New Brentford, 8 miles;
thence to Stanes, 7; to Hartley-row, 16 more; from thence to Basingstoke, 8;
thence to Whitchurch, 10; to Andover, 6 more; and from Andover to Salisbury, 15.

This is the City otherwise called New Sarum, raised out of an old one known to
the Romans by the Name of Sorbiodunum, which was drily seated on a great
Eminence, being a Place only designed for Strength. Yet it was for some time
honored with an Episcopal See, and a fair Cathedral. As to the present City,
it is pleasantly seated among several Rivers, whose Streams do commodiously
water most of the Streets; and almost encompassed with open Fields and Plains,
which take their Name from it. In which Plains, about 6 miles distance, is to
be seen the Stone-henge, as before described. In short, this City for fair
Buildings is inferior to none, and transcends all others for the benefit of
Water, almost every Street having a River running through the midst thereof,
among which the Avon is the principal. The Streets are large and spacious,
accommodated with a fine Marketplace, and adorned with a fair Building, the
Town Hall. But the greatest Ornament of this City, and indeed one of the
principal Ornaments of England, is the Cathedral, a most stately and
magnificent Church. Which, being begun by Richard Poor Bishop of this See, and
finished in the Year 1258. by Bridport, the third Bishop from him, was
dedicated to the honor of the Blessed Virgin. This Church has 12 Gates, 52
Windows, and 365 Pillars great and small; the first answering to the Number of
Months, the second to that of the Weeks, and the third to the Number of Days,
in the Year. Its Steeple has a lofty Spire, which proudly shows it self from a
great distance. And (which is remarkable) an Imperial Crown stood at the very
top of all, which by a sudden Gust of Wind was thrown down to the Ground at the
very time when the late King James was at Salisbury, in order to oppose the
Prince of Orange's Forces coming this way from the West. Which two days after
was followed by his Desertion of that Place, and soon after by the Desertion of
the Crown and Government.

Moreover, this City has been for several Ages honored with the Title of an
Earldom, 1. in the persons of Patrick and William D'Evreux, successively. 2. In
two Williams surnamed Long-Espee, the first a base Son of King Henry II. by
Rosamond. 3. In two Nevils, both Richards by their Christen-names. 4. In the
person of George, Duke of Clarence, who married Isabel, Daughter of Richard,
Earl of Warwick. 5. In Edward, eldest Son of King Richard III. 6. In Margaret,
Daughter of George, Duke of Clarence, created Countess of Salisbury by King
Henry VIII. And lastly in the Family that now injoy's it, the first being
Robert Cecil, Lord of Essendine, and Viscount Cranborn, created Earl of
Salisbury by King James I. Anno 1605. From whom is descended the present Earl,
James Cecil.

Lastly, this City is a Place well inhabited and frequented, enjoying a good
Trade. And its Markets, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, are very considerable for
all sorts of Provisions.

The other Market Towns are Marlborough, Sat. Malmsbu^y, Sat. Chippenham, Sat.
Werminster, Sat. Troubridge, Sat. Cricklade, Sat. Bradford, Mund. Swindon,
Mund. Calne, Tue. Auburn, Tue. Lavington, Wedn. Wilton, Wedn. Highworth, Wedn.
Devizes, Thu. Hindon, Thu. Wooten-Basset, Thu. Downton, Frid. Amersbury, Frid.
Westbury, Frid. Mere, Marmister,


Among which Marlborough (or Marleburgh) is, next to Salisbury, the most
considerable. Town in this County. The Town called anciently Cunetio in
Antonine's Itinerarium, as the River Kennet was upon which it stands; but by
the Normans, in whose Time this Town revived out of the Ruins of the old, it
was named Marleburgh, as being seated in a chalky Soil, which in some Places is
still called by the name of Marl. A Town stretched out from East to West upon
the ascent of a Hill, watered by the Kennet, not far from the head of it; and
having the convenience both of a Forest and Chase in its Neighborhood, the
first called Savernake-Forest, and the other Aldburn Chase. It had once a
Castle belonging unto John, surnamed Sans Terre, who afterward was King of
England. The Castle still famous in our Law Books for a Parliament there held
in the Reign of King Henry III. in which were made the Statutes from hence
called of Marleburgh, for the suppressing of Tumults. But King Charles 1. at
this Coronation made it yet more notable, in making it the Honor, as it was
the Neighbor, of James Lord Ley, Lord Treasurer, created by that King Earl of
Marlbourough Anno 1625. Which Title continued in three Persons more of his Name
and Family; and, since the late Revolution, was conferred by our present King
upon the Right Honorable John Churchill, the present Earl of Marlborough. This
Town has suffered very much by the frequent Misfortune of Fire, under which it
groans to this day.

Near unto this Place is a Village called Rockley, from diverse Stones like
Rocks pitched up on end. Among which there sometimes breaks forth a violent
Stream of Water, called Hungersbourn by the Country People, by whom it is
reputed as the forerunner of a Dearth.

Malmesbury, another good Town, stands in the North-West Parts of the County,
pleasantly seated on a Hill, near the Spring of the River Avon, over which it
has six Bridges, being almost incircled with that River.

Chippenham and Bradford are also seated on the Avon; and Troubridge, near it;
Amersbury, or Ambresbury, (commonly pronounced Ambsbury) on the other Avon,
near the Stone-henge, and but 6 miles North of Salisbury. Upon which River,
near the Confines of Hampshire, you will find also the Town called Downton, or
Duncton.

Calne is situate on a River so called, which runs from East to West into the
Bristol Avon. This Town is noted for the Provincial Synod held here in the Year
977, to determine the hot Disputes in those Times between the Monks and the
Priests concerning Celibacy. But, whilst they were debating the Matter in hand,
the Convocation-house suddenly fell down; by which Fall several were slain, and
many cruelly wounded.

Wilton is seated between two Rivers, the Willy Northward, and the Nadder
Southward. From the first it took its Denomination, as the whole County from
Wilton. Once the chief Town thereof, and a Bishops See, honored with the
Residence of nine several Bishops. But by translating the Sea to Salisbury, and
carrying thither withal the Thoroughfare into the West-Country, which before
was here, it fell by little and little to decay. So that it is at present but a
mean Town. Yet still a Borough-Town, the Place where the Knights of the Shire
are chosen, and where the Sheriff keeps his monthly County-Courts.

Werminster, of old Verlucio, a Town in former Time of very good account, is
seated at the Springs of the River Willy, otherwise called Willybourn.

Westbury and Devizes are two Borough-Towns, that is, such Towns as fend
Burgesses to Parliament. The first situate on the Broke, a small River that
falls into the Avon; Devizes, at the very head of another Stream bearing the
Name of the Town, which likewise does empty it self into the Avon.

I pass by the rest as Inconsiderable, to take notice of Clarendon; a fine
spacious Park lying near to and Eastward of Salisbury. It Is seated upon a Hill,
on which stand twenty Groves, severally enclosed, and each a mile in compass.
Adorned in Times past with a Royal House, which in process of time is falnto
ruin. But more remarkable for that in the Reign of Henry the Second, Anno 1164,
here was made a certain Recognition and Record of the Customs and Liberties of
the Kings of England before the Prelates and Peers of the Kingdom, for the
avoiding Dissentions between the Clergy, the Judges, and Barons of the R^^lm.
Which Act was called The Constitutions of Clarendon, whereof so many as the
Pope approved have been set down in the Tomes of the Councils, and the rest
omitted. But that which has added more luster to Clarendon is its being
Dignified with the Title of an Earldom; first in the person of Edward Hyde,
sometime Lord Chancellor of England, who was created Viscount Cornbury in
Oxfordshire, and Earl of Clarendon by King Charles II, Anno 1661. Upon whose
Death at Rouen in Normandy Dec. 19th, 1674, he was succeeded in his Title by
his eldest Son Henry Hyde, the present Earl of Clarendon.

To conclude, this County (which formerly was Part of the Kingdom of the
West Saxons, and its Inhabitants part of the Belgae, as the Romans called them)
is now in the Diocese of Salisbury.

Out of it are chosen, besides the two Knights of the Shire, no less than 32
Members to fit in Parliament, Viz. two out of each of these following Towns,
New Sarum or Salisbury, Wilton, Downton, Hindon, Westbury, Heytesbury, Calne,
the Devizes, Chippen. ham, Malmesbury, Cricklade, Great Bedwin, Lurgershal, Old
Sarum, Wootton Basset, and Marlborough.

But we must not omit the famous Caves, that ly in the edge of this Shire,
between Luckington and great Badminton. They are about nine in Number, all
lying in a Row, but of different Dimensions. The Manner of them is two long
Stones set upon the sides, and broad Stones on the top to cover them. The least
of these Caves is 4 foot broad, and some of them 9 or 10 foot long. They are
credibly thought, not (...) be Giants Caves, as the Country People give it out,
but rather the Tombs of some heroic Men among the ancient Romans, Saxons, or
Danes. And that which makes it so much the more probable is, that Spurs, and
pieces of Armor, etc. have been found there not long since by those who dug
into them.

Lastly, this County has given the Title of an Earl to several Families; which
now belongs to his Grace Charles Pawlet, Duke of Bolton, Marquess of
Winchester, Earl of Wiltshire, and Baron S. John of Basing. All which Titles,
except that of Duke, devolved to him from his Ancestor William Pawlet; Created
Earl of Wiltshire, and afterward Marquess of Winchester, by King Edward VI. And
that of Duke was lately conferred upon him by his present Majesty.

CHAP. XVII.
Of Worcestershire, and Yorkshire.

Worcestershire.
WORCESTERSHIRE, an Inland County, is bounded on the East by Warwickshire, and
part of Glocestershire; on the West, by Herefordshire, and part of Shropshire;
on the North, by Staffordshire; and on the South, by Glocestershire.

It contains in Length, from North to South, about 35 miles; in Breadth, from
East to West, about 25. The Whole divided into seven Hundreds, wherein 152
Parishes, and 11 Market Towns.

A County of an Air so temperate, and a Soil so fortunate, that it gives place
to none about it, either for health or plenty. Abundant certainly it is in all
sorts of Fruits this Climate can afford, Pears and Cherries especially,
insomuch that here is made abundance of Perry. Here are also many Salt Pits,
called Wiches, which yield excellent Salt, and such as for whiteness and
hardness imitateth Loaf-Sugar.

It Is true this County is pretty full of Hills, but such Hills as are not
barren, yielding plenty of Wood and store of Pasturage; whilst the Valleys on
the other side feed abundance of Cattle, and bear good Crops of Corn.

Through these Valleys run so many Rivers, that few Counties are better watered
with fresh Streams. Here we meet again that noble River, the Severn, which runs
quite through the Country from North to South, and affords here great store of
Fresh Water Lampreys. Besides the Avon, the Team, the Salwarp, etc. which run
into the Severn, and yield abundance of Fish.

Worcester, the chief Place hereof, and from whence the County is denominated,
bears from London West-North-West, and is distant therefrom near upon 90 miles,
thus. From London to Oxford 47 miles, as you may see afterward in my
Description of Oxford; from thence to Chipping-Norton, 12; and to Campden, 12
more; thence to Pershore, 10; and to Worcester, 6 more.

Pleasantly seated on the East Bank of the Severn, over which it has a fair
Stone Bridge with a Tower upon it, and thence arising with a gentle ascent
affords to the upper Parts a very goodly Prospect in the Vale beneath. A City
every way considerable, for Situation, neat Buildings, Number of Churches, and
Wealth of the Inhabitants, by reason of their Cloth-Trade which does here
flourish very much.

This City called by Antonine and Ptolomy Branonium, and by the Romans
Vigornia, is said to have been first built by the Romans, the better to secure
themselves from the Britains beyond the Severn. But in the time of King Canute,
it suftered much from the Danes, and afterward by frequent Conflagrations,
which laid it almost waste, and despairing of a Recovery. Yet it rose at last
out of its Ashes, and by degrees so improved as to contain at present nine
Parish-Churches, besides the Cathedral. This is a stately Structure, in whose
Quire are the Monuments of King John in white Marble, and of Arthur Prince of
Wales, and Son to Henry VII. in blak Jeat. The Castle I shall say nothing of,
as having nothing left of it but the Name and Ruins.

But Worcester is particularly memorable for the Battle fought there Sept. 3.
1651. betwixt the late King Charles and the Parliament Forces, wherein the
King's Army was totally defeated. So that he was fain to shift for himself, and
to wander six Weeks in Disguise about the Country, till he was at laft
transported from a Creek near Shoram in Sussex to Feccam near Havre de Grace in
France.

Lastly, this City has a long time given the Title of Earl, and at last that of
Marquess, to the Family of the Somersets, extracted by the Beauforts from John
of Gaunt. For Charles Somerset, who was created Earl of Worcester by King Henry
VIII, was base Son of Henry Beaufort, the 8th Duke of Somerset, beheaded in
Edward the fourth's Reign.

Lastly this City keeps 3 Markets a Week, viz. Wednesdays, Fridays, and
Saturdays.

The other Market Towns are Bewdley, Sat. Evesham, Mund. Pershore, Tue.
Bromes-grove, Tue. Tenbury, Tue. Vpton, Thu. Kidderminster, Thu. Sturbridge,
Frid. Shipton, Frid. Droitwich, Frid.


Among which Bewdley and Vpton stand upon the Severn, the first in the North,
the other in the South Parts of this County. Bewdley, near the Forest of Wire,
was in former time a Place of great delight, and of good account in the Reign
of Henry VII, where he built a retiring House for Prince Arthur, and called it
Ticken-Hall. The Town at present is neat and well built, and injoys a good
Trade for Barley, Malt, Caps, and Leather. Vpton is also a well built Town, and
was of great account in the time of the Romans. Not far from which are the
Malvern-Hills, and opposite to 'em Eastwards the Bredon-Hills.

Evesham (or Evesholm) and Pershore are both seated on the Avon, over which
they have each a Bridge. The first esteemed the best Town in the County next to
Worcester, containing two or three Parish-Churches, and driving a good Trade,
of Stockings especially. The other a great Thorough-fare betwixt London and
Worcester, but somewhat decayed in its Trade, since the Dissolution of its
ancient Abbey.

Droitwich and Bromes-grove are both situate on the Banks of the Salwarp. The
first noted for its Salt Pits, and the last for its Clothing Trade. Not far
from Droitwich is Fakenham-Forest and Norton-Wood, which stand commodious for
the Salt-Works, to supply them with Wood for the boiling the brine in their
Coppers.

Sturbridge and Kidderminster, two goodly Towns stand both on the River Stower,
over which they have each a Bridge. The first is situate on a Flat, and has the
accommodation of a Free-Shool, with a Library. Kidderminster is well inhabited,
much traded unto for its Stuffs, and beautified with a very fair Church.

As for Tenbury and Shipton, the first stands on the very edge of Shropshire,
upon the Banks of the River Tent. And Shipton, upon Stower, in a slip of the
County taken off from Warwickshire.

To conclude this Connty (now in the Diocese of Worcester) was part of the
ancient Kingdom of Mercia, and its Inhabitants part of the Cornavii, in the
Time of the Romans.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, seven Members of
Parliament. Viz. 2 by Worcester, 2 by Droitwich, 2 by Evesham, 1. by Bewdley.
And so much for Worcestershire.

Yorkshire.
YORKSHIRE, a Maritime County, and the greatest in the whole Kingdom, is
bounded Eastward by the German Ocean; Westward, by Lancashire and Westmorland;
Northward, by the said Ocean, and the Bishopric of Durham, from which parted
by the River Tees; and Southward, by Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby Shires.

Its Length, from East to West, is 80 miles; its Breadth, from North to South,
70. The Whole divided first into three Parts, called Ridings, viz. the East,
West, and North Riding. Which together contain 26 Wapentakes or Hundreds,
wherein 563 Parish-Churches, and 49 Market Towns. A small number of Parishes
for such an Extent of Ground, but that there are great many Chapels of Ease,
equal for bignesss and resort of people to any Parish elsewhere.

The East Riding (which is by much the least of the three) takes up only that
part of Yorkshire which lies between the River Derwent went and the Sea. The
North Riding takes up the North Parts as far as Westmorland. And the
West Riding, the largest of the three, is bounded on the North by the two
former Ridings, on the South by the Counties of Derby, Nottingham, and
Cheshire, Eastward by Lincolnshire, and Westward by Lancashire.

The Soil is generally fruitful, in a very good measure. And, (as says Speed,)
if one Part thereof is stony and barren Ground, another is as fertile and
richly adorned with Corn and Pasturage. If here you find it naked and destitute
of Woods, in other Places you shall find it shadowed with most spacious
Forests. If it be somewhere moorish, miry, and unpleasant, elsewhere it is as
pleasant as the Eye can wish.

As for Rivers, here are many of good note. For, besides the Tees which parts
this County from Durham, here you will find the Swale, the Your, and the Nyd,
of which the Ouse at York is a Compound. Besides the Warfe, the Are, the
Calder, and Derwent, which from several Parts fall into the Ouse below York. To
which add the Dun, which severs part of this County from Lincolnshire; and the
Hull, which falls into the Humber at Hull. As for the Humber, which is the
largest of all, it cannot be said properly to be a distinct River, but rather a
Compound, or a Mouth, of several Rivers joining into one Stream, as I have
already hinted in the beginning of this Part.

York, (in Latin Eboracum) the chief Place of Yorkshire, bears from London
North-by-West, and is distant therefrom 150 miles; thus. From London to
Huntington, 48 miles, for the particulars of which I refer you to
Huntingtonshire; from Huntington to Stamford, 21; to Grantham, 16 more; thence
to Newark, 10; to Tuxford, 9 more; from Tuxford to Duncaster, 18; to
Wentbridge, 7 more; thence to Tadcaster, 12; and to York, 9 more.

A City which, for fame and greatness, is the second City of England. It is in
the North Riding, situate on the River Ouse, which divides it into two Parts,
but joined together by a stately Stone Bridge. Of which two Parts, that toward
the East is the most populous, the Houses standing thicker, and the Streets
narrower. In general, it is a fair, large, and beautiful City, adorned with
many fair Buildings both public and private, and enclosed with a strong Wall,
with several Turrets upon it. A City rich and populous, well inhabited by
Gentry and wealthy Tradesmen, and containing about 30 Parish-Churches and
Chapels, besides its Cathedral, dedicated to St. Peter. First built by Edwyn,
the first Christian King of the Northumbers Anno 627, and finished by King
Oswald his next Successor but one. But, being afterward destroyed by Fire, and
by the fury of the Danes, that which now stands was erected in the place
thereof by Archbishop Thomas, the 25th of this See, and after by degrees
adorned and beautified by his Successors. Of that magnificent Structure, which
may justly put her in the first Rank of the Cathedrals in Europe.

In short, the Romans of old had this City in such great esteem, that Severus
their Emperor had his Palace here, where he ended his Days. Here also, upon
the Death of Fl. Valerius Constantius, surnamed Chlorus, his Son Constantine
was forthwith proclaimed Emperor. Nor did this City flourish only under the
Romans, for it has been of as eminent Reputation in all Ages since; and in the
several Turns and Changes which have befallen this Kingdom, under the Saxons,
Danes, and Normans, has still preserved its ancient Luster. Adorned it was with
an Archbishops See in the time of the Britains; nor stooped it lower when the
Saxons embraced the Gospel. Richard II, laying unto it a little Territory on
the West Side thereof, made it a County Incorporate, as our Lawyers term it; in
which the Archbishops of York enjoy the Right of Palatines. It is governed, as
London, by a Lord Mayor, London and York being the only Cities whose Mayors
bear the Title of Lord. But not so much famed by that, as by the Title of Duke
it has given to diverse Princes of the Royal Blood; and particularly to the late
King James, before he came to the Crown.

As for its Markets, it has two a Week, viz. on Thursdays and Saturdays.

The other Market Towns are 1. In the East Riding, Heydon, Sat. Howden, Sat.
Burlington, Sat. Pocklington, Sat. Hull, Tue. and Sat. Wighton, Wedn. Beverley,
Wedn. and Sat. Kilham, Thu.
2. In the West Riding. Duncaster, Sat. Sherburn, Sat. Tickhill, Sat. Bautrey,
Sat. Pontefract, Sat. Boroughbridge, Sat. Skipton, Sat. Rotheram, Mund. Selby,
Mund. Otley, Tue. Settle, Tue. Sheffield, Tue. Leeds, Tue. and Sat. Wakefield,
Thu. and Frid. Ripley, Frid. Snathe, Frid. Thorn, Barnesley, Wedn.
Knaresborough, Wedn. Hallifax, Thu. Bradforth, Thu. Tadcaster, Thu. Weatherby,
Thu. Rippon, Thu.
3. In the North Riding, Richmond, Sat. Whitby, Sat. Stokesly, Sat. Malton,
Sat. Helmley, Sat. Pickering, Mun. Middleham, Mun. Gisborough, Mun. Thirsk,
Mun. Bedal, Tue. Masham, Tue. North-Allerton, Wed. Abberforth, Wed.
Kirby-Moreside, Wed. Scarborough, Thu. Yarum, Thu.



In the East Riding, the Town of chief note is Hull, otherwise called Kingston
upon Hull, seated at the very fall of the Hull into the Humber. A Town of no
great Antiquity, being first built by King Edward I; who called it Kingston,
made an Harbor t^ it, and gave such Encouragements to its Inhabitants by the
Privileges he granted them that it grew up quickly to what it is. A large Town
to this day, though containing but two Parish Churches; graced with fai^
Buildings, and well ordered Streets, with a Custom-house and Key by the
Waterside. Here Ships come to lade and unlade their Merchandises, and in the
next Street to it (not unlike Thames Street in London) they find all
Necessaries for Shipping, such as Pitch, Tar, Cordage, Sails, etc. A Town so
fortified withal with Walls, Ditches, Forts, Blockhouses, and Castles, that
with a suitable Garrison to it, it may be looked upon as one of the strongest
Holds in the Kingdom, and the most capable of Defense. It Is a Borough-Town, and
a County of it self; dignified with the Title of an Earldom in the person of
the Right Honourrble William Pierpont, the present Earl of Kingston upon Hull,
Viscount Newark, etc.

From Hull there runs a Promontory, which shoots its self forth a great way
into the Sea. A Promontory called by Ptolomy Ocellum, and by us Holderness, in
which are diverse Towns. Honored with the Title of an Earldom, 1. In the person
of John Ramsey, Viscount Hardington in Scotland, Created Earl of Holderness,
and Baron of Kingston upon Thames, by King James I. Anno 1620. 2. In the person
of the late Prince Rupert, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Created Duke of
Cumberland, and Earl of Holderness by King Charles I. in the Year 1643. 3. In
the person of the Right Honorable Coniers D'Arcie, the present Earl of
Holderness, advanced to that Dignity by King Charles II.

Beverly, a few miles North of Hull, is seat^d on the Western Bank of the River
Hull, which gives passage for Boats and Barges ^own into the Humber. It Is a
large Borough-Town, containing two Parish-Churches, and well-inhabited both by
Gentry and Tradesmen. Of some note for being the Burial-Place of Sir John of
Beverly, Archbishop of York; ^ho, being weary of the World, resigned up his
Bishopric, and here ended his Days (...) a holy Life about the Year 721.

Heydon stands few miles East of Hull, upon (...) small River near its fall
into the Humber. It Is an ancient Borough-Town, formerly of great account, and
enjoying a good Trade; ^ill the Rise of its neighbor Hull occasioned ^ts Decay.

Howden, a good large Town, but unhealthfull, is seated near the Confluence of
the Ouse and Derwent. It gives name to a small Territory, from hence called
Owdenshire.

North-West from this Territory is another called Derwentwater, lying betwixt
the Ouse and the Derwent. Honored with the Title of an Earldom in the person
of the Right Honorable Francis Ratcliff, created Earl of Der^entwater by King
James II.

Pocklington, a small Town, stands North and by East from Howden, upon a small
River that falls into the Derwent. Kilham, North-East from Pocklington, is a
long Town, dri^y seated on the Woulds, but in a good Soil for Corn.

Burlington, or Bridlington, noted for its famous Bay, from hence called
Burlington-Bay, stands high about a mile from the Sea. But, ^y the Seaside, is
the Key called Burlington-Key, where the Ships in the Harbor are supplied with
such Provisions as they stand in need of. The Town of some note besides, for
giving the Title of an Earl to the Right Honorable Richard Boil, Baron
Clifford of Landsborough, Youghal, and Bandon, Viscount of Kynalmeaky and
Dungarvan, and Earl of Cork in Ireland; Created Earl of Burlington by King
Charles II. Anno 1664.

Within two miles from Burlington North-Eastward is that noted Promontory, or
Foreland, called Flamborough-Head, from Flamborough a small Town in it.

In the West Riding, upon the River Dun, you will find Sheffield, Rotheram, and
Duncaster. Upon the Calder, Halifax, and Wakefield. Near, or upon the Are,
Skipton, Bradforth, Leeds, Pontefract, and Snathe. Upon the Warfe, Otley,
Wetherby, and Tadcaster. Betwixt the Are and Warfe, Sherburn. Upon the Ouse,
Selby. On the Nyd, Ripley, and Knasborough. Upon the Your, Rippon, and
Boroughbridge. And on the Rible, Settle.

Sheffield, upon the Dun, is a good large Town, whose Houses are built of
Stone. Its Market is great for several Commodities, but Corn especially, which
is much bought up here for the supply of some Parts of Derbyshire,
Nottinghamshire, and the West of Yorkshire. A Town that trades much besides, by
reason of the Iron Mines in these Parts, in Iron Wares, and Edge-tools,
especially Knives and Blades. Whereof so ancient an Author as Chaucer takes
notice, speaking of a Person that had a Sheafield Whittle by his side. Here is
still to be seen the Rains of a Castle, one of the five which were seated on
this River, all within ten miles distance.

Lastly, this Town, with diverse others, belongs to the Wapentake of Strafford.
Which gives the Title of an Earl to the Right Honorable William Wentworth, the
present Earl of Strafford.

Rotheram has a fine Stone Bridge over the River Dun, and its Houses are also
built of Stone. A Place of some note, for giving birth to Thomas of Rotheram,
Archbishop of York; who founded here a College with three Schools, for the
instructing of Youth in Grammar, Music, and Writing; but long since laid aside.

Duncaster; a great Thorough-fare in the Northern Road, is so called from a
Castle that stood here on the River Dun, but not ^ong since ruinated. In the
Year 759. this Town was reduced to ashes, and lay for some time in its Ruins.
But it was raised up again, with a fair Church and Steeple. And it is now a
goodly Town, well accommodated with Inns for Travelers, and driving a good
Trade of knit Wastcoats, Peticoats, Gloves, and Stockings.

But we must not omit, that of late years it became of more remark, by giving
the Title of Viscount to James Hay, Baron of Sauley, Created by King James I.
Viscount of Duncaster, and Earl of Carlisle. Which from him passed to his Son
and Heir, James Hay; but he dying without Issue-male, the Title fell with him.
In the Reign of King Charles II. it was improved by that King to the Title of
an Earldom, which he conferred with the Title of Duke of Monmouth upon the late
James Fitz-Roy, Anno 1663.

Halifax, anciently called Horton, stands betwixt the Calder and a small River
that fal^ into it. It Is a good large Town, with Stone built Houses, but seated
in a barren Soil, upon a steep descent of a Hill. It is said to contain at
least 10000 Inhabitants, and ye^ but one Parish Church, which Defect is indeed
supplied by diverse Chapels of Ease The Inhabitants noted for their Industry i^
making of Cloth and other Manufactures* but chiefly for the strict Law they
have within themselves for the present Punishmen^ of Cloth-stealers. To which
the Proverb alludes, as it refers to Beggars and vagran^ People, From Hell,
Hull, and Hallifax, go^ Lord, deliver us. The Town not further considerable,
till it attained the honor of giving the Title first of Viscount, secondly o^
Earl, and lastly of Marquess to the Righ^ Honorable George Savil, the present
Marquel^ of Halifax. To all which degrees of Honor he was successively
advanced by King Charles II.

About 6 miles from Halifax, near the Calder, and on a steep, Hill, is seated
Almondbury, the ancient Cambodunum. A Place of great repute, when the
English-Saxons first began their Regal Government. For it was then the Royal
Seat, and had in it a Cathedral, built by Paulinus the Apostle of these Parts.
Here was also a Fort and Castle, long since reduced to ruins.

Wakefield, on the Calder, is a large Stonebuilt Town, of good Antiquity. Over
the River it has a fair Stone Bridge, upon which Edward IV. erected a stately
Chapel, in remembrance of those who lost their Lives in his Quarrel. The
Inhabitants of this Town are noted for their Clothing Trade.

Skipton, Bradforth, and Pontefract, are all three seated upon so many small
Streams, near their fall into the Are. Among which Skipton stands in a hilly,
rough, craggy, and unpleasant part of the Country, called Craven. Which gives
the Title of an Earl to the Right Honorable William Craven, created Earl of
Craven, Anno 1664.

Pontefract, or Pomfret, is a neat Borough-Town, pleasantly seated in a dry
Spot of Ground, upon a small Stream a little below the Confluence of the Warfe
and the Are. Formerly strengthened with a strong and stately Castle, mounted on
an Ascent, and fortified with Ditches and Bulwarks; but was demolished in the
long Civil Wars. In this Castle it was that Richard II. was murdered, after his
Resignation of the Crown. About ^his Town grow's plenty of Licorish.

Leeds, on the Are, is an ancient Town, where formerly the Kings of
Northumberland ^ad their Royal Palace. And now it is so considerable, that it
is counted one of the ^est Towns in Yorkshire. Well-inhabited it is, ^specially
by Clothiers, who drive a great Trade for their Cloths.

Near unto Snathe, a small Town, is a little ^ountry of about 15 miles in
compass, called Marsh-Land and Ditch-Marsh, which yields ex^ellent feeding for
Cattle.

Tadcaster, on the Warfe, is noted for two things. Viz. the large Stone Bridge
it has ^er the River, and the plenty of Limestone ^gged up in its
Neighborhood.

Sherburn is seated between the Are and the ^arfe upon a small Stream that
mixes its ^aters with those of the Warfe and Ouse ^here those two meet
together. The Town is small, but well inhabited, and has a famous Free School.
Of some note besides for its Pins, and Cherries; and for the Quarries near it,
whose Stones when first taken out of the Quarries are very soft, but seasoned
with Wind and Weather become very hard and durable.

Selby, on the Ouse, is a good large Town; chiefly noted for being the
Birthplace of King Henry I.

Ripley, on the Nyd, is but a small Market Town. Knaresborough is much more
considerable, being a well built Borough-Town, and fortified with a Castle upon
a ragged rough Rock. About this Town, as well as Pontefract, grow's plenty of
Licorish. And under it is a Well, distilled from the Rocks that hang over it,
the Water whereof (says Speed) does turn Wood into Stone.

Rippon, near the Your, over which it has a Bridge, is a Place of good
Antiquity. Where stood once that stately Monastery built by Wilfride Archbishop
of York; which being destroyed with the Town by the Danes, wa^ again repaired
by Odo Archbishop of Canter bury, by whom the Relics of Wilfride were
translated to Canterbury. The Town a present is one of the best in the whole
County, well inhabited by Gentry and Tradesmen and among these by Clothiers and
Spu^ makers, the Rippon Spurs being of specia^ note Its chief Ornament is the
Collegia^ Church, set out with no less than 3 loft Spire-Steeples. In this
Church was S. Wilfride Needle, a narrow Hole in a Vault under Groun^ where it
is said Women's Honesty was trie^ Those that were chaste, says the Story, cou^
easily pass through; but the unchaste, it seems, stuck by the way. Not far from
this Town is the lofty Hill of Michelholme.

Boroughbridge, on the Your, over which it has a Stone Bridge, is a small
Borough-Town, but a great Thorough-Fare in the Northern Road. Of special note
for the four huge Stones, like unto Pyramids, that stand in a direct line in
three little Fields near this Town. The Country People call them the Devil's
Bolts; but Cambden is of opinion, that they were here erected by the Romans,
for a Monument of some Victory obtained by them.

In the North Riding, we may reckon Richmond as one of the chief Places. It Is
at least the chief of that Part of it which is called Richmondshire, containing
five Wapentakes (or Hundreds) within its Jurisdiction. A Tract of Ground lying
North-Westward, with rugged Rocks and swelling Mountains; whose Sides in some
places bear good Grass, and the Bottoms underneath not unfruitful. And in the
Hills themselves are found good Mines of Lead and Pit-coal. Yet there are in it
many waste Places, void of Inhabitants; as Deep-Dale, Swale-Dale-Forest,
Apple-Garth-Forest, and others.

As for Richmond it self, it is seated on the North-Banks of the Swale, over
which it has a Stone Bridge. This River (which with a mighty noise runs here
underneath the Town) was reputed very sacred by the ancient English, for that
in it Paulinus, the first Archbishop of York, baptized in one day above ten
thousand Men, besides Women and Children. The Town is of a small Circuit in the
Walls; but, by reason of its Suburbs lying out in length, very well peopled and
frequented. First built by Alane (Earl of Bretagne in France, and the first
Earl of this Place) after the Entrance of the Normans. Who fenced it with a
Wall, and a most strong Castle, the better to secure these Parts against the
English; and, having finished the same, gave it the Name of Richmount, as a
Place equally participating of strength and beauty. As to its present state, it
contains two Parish-Churches, is graced with well built Houses, many of them of
Freestone, well inhabited by Gentry and Tradesmen, and injoys a good Trade
(for an Inland Town) for Stockings chiefty, and woollen Knit Caps for Seamen.

The Earls of Bretagne for a long time together continued in the Title and
Possession of this County; and since, it has been bestowed upon other Families.
In the Year 1641. James Stewart, Duke of Lenox, and Earl of March, was created
Duke of Richmond by King Charles I. Esme, his Son, succeeded him; who died
young, Anno 1660. Thus the Title fell to his Cousin german, Charles Earl of
Lichfield; who died without Issue Ambassador in Denmark, in the year 1672.
And, within less than 3 years after, the Title was conferred by King Charles
II, upon his Grace Charles Lenox, the present Duke of Richmond, his natural Son
by the Duchess of Portsmouth.

In this Tract also, near Middleton on the Your, is Bolton-Castle, seated in a
Park. Lately honored with the Title of a Dukedom, in the person of his Grace
Charles Pawlet, the present Duke of Bolton.

Scarborough, upon the Sea, is a Place of great Strength, as well by Nature as
Art. Seated on a steep Rock, with such craggy Cliffs, that it is almost
Inaccessible on every side; and washed by the Sea on all parts but the West,
where there is a narrow Passage, and that fenced with a strong Wall. On the top
of the Rock is a fair, green, and large Plain, containing above 60 Acres of
Ground, with a fresh Water Spring issuing out of the Rock. Here was formerly a
stately Tower which served as a Landmark for Ships, but was demolished in the
long Civil Wars. At this time it is fortified with a strong Castle, wherein a
Garrison is kept. The Town is not very large, but well built, and well
inhabited; and, as it has a commodious Key, it injoy's a pretty good Trade.
Several Vessels belong unto this Town, employed especially in Herring-Fishing
Season, which are taken on this Coast in great plenty. This Place is also noted
for its famous Spaw, which is much resorted unto. But of late, in a more
particular manner, for giving the Title of Earl to the Right Honorable Richard
Lumley, newly created Earl of Scarborough.

Between this Town and Whitby to the Northward is Robin Hoods Bay, so called
from Robin-Hood, that noted Robber in the Reign of Richard I. About which is
found a sort of Jeat, or black Amber.

Whitby, another Sea-Town, is commodiously seated on the River Esk, at its
Influx into the Sea. A pretty neat Town, with a Bridge over the River, and
driving a good Trade, chiefly for Alum and Butter. Here is a Custom-House, and
great many Vessels belonging to the Town. Formerly a Place of note for its
Abbey, but chiefly for the Abbess thereof, S. Hilda, so famed in her time for
working of Miracles. One of which Tradition tells us was her ridding this Part
of the Country of Snakes which infected it much, and conjuring of them into the
Sea by her fervent Prayers. Which is backed by those who aver, that at the Root
of the craggy Rocks that are upon the Shore therely Stones scattered here and
there, naturally as round as a Bullet. In which Stones, being broken, are found
stony Serpents wrapped round, but most of them headless.

Not far from Whitby is Mulgrave, an ancient Castle situate near unto the Sea,
and first built in the Time of Richard II by Peter de Mauley. Who, being
pleased with it, called it Mouligrace, that is, a fine Seat. But, as it proved
a grievous Yoke to the neighbor Inhabitants, they nicknamed it, and called it
Moultgrave, since turned into Mulgrave, by which Name it go's to this day. It
continued in this Line for 7 Generations, and all of them called Peter's too.
The Issue male failing, it passed through several Families, till it came to the
Sheffields. Out of which House Edmund, Lord Sheffield of Butterwick, Lord
President of the North, was created Earl of Mulgrave by King Charles I. Anno
1625. To whom succeeded in the Title Edmund, his Grandson by Sir John
Sheffield his second Son. Who dying in the Year 1658. left his Title to his Son
and Heir, the Right Honorable John Sheffield, the present Earl of Mulgrave.

Some miles West from Mulgrave Castle is a small Sea-Town, called Skeningrave;
not to be omitted, were it but for the following Account of the Seal-fish.
Hereabouts near unto Hunt-Cliff, at low Water, appear Rocks not far from the
Shore, about which the Seal-fish come in great Sholes, and in fair and warm
Weather ly sleeping and sunning themselves. But, as it has been observed, while
they ly thus asleep, one of them is upon the Watch, and acts the part of a
Sentinel. Who, upon the appearance of any Danger, gives the Signal by flouncing
into the Water, the Noise whereof awakes the rest, and so they make their
escape. They are not afraid (says my Author) of Women, but only of Men; and
therefore they that catch 'em put on Women's Clothes. If, when they are chased,
they find themselves too far from the Water, their Way is with their hinder
feet to fling Sand and Gravel backward in the Pursuers faces, which forces 'em
sometimes to quit the Sport.

Some miles from this Coast to the Southward is a Tract of Land, called
Cleveland, taking that Name (as Cambden tells us) of the Cliffs, or steep
Banks, which run all along the side thereof, and at the foot of which the
Country spreads it self into a fine fruitful Plain. A Territory besides of a
good extent, which gave the Title of an Earl to Thomas Lord Wentworth, created
Earl of Cleveland by King Charles I. But, leaving no Issue, the Title died with
him, Anno 1670. King Charles II. conferred the Title of Duchess of Cleveland
upon Barbara Villiers, Daughter to the Lord Viscount Grandison who was slain in
the Civil Wars, the Earl of Castlemain's Wife, and Mother of three Dukes, viz.
the Duke of Southampton, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Northumberland.

In this Tract (I mean Cleveland) is an ancient Castle, called Danby, seated
near unto a large Park, and a goodly Chase of the same Name. It belonged
anciently to the Lord Latimer, and was sold (with other Lands belonging to that
Family) to Ralph Nevil, Earl of Westmorland, who forthwith gave the same to his
Son Sir George Nevil. And, not long after, King Henry VI. summoned him to the
Parliament by the Name of Lord Latimer. Whose Issue male failing in Queen
Elizabeth's Time, the Estate was divided between his two Daughters. The Castle,
with the Lands adjoining, fell to the share of Mary, Wife to Sir John Danvers
of Wiltshire. By whom she got Sir Henry Danvers, Created by King James I. Lord
Danvers of Danby, and by King Charles I. Earl of Danby, But he, dying without
Issue, the Title lay dormant, till revived by Charles II. By whom the Right
Honorable Thomas Osborn, now Marquess of Caermarthen, was created Baron of
Kineton, and Viscount Latimer, in the Year 1673, and Earl of Danby the next
Year.

Gisborough is pleasantly seated in a Flat, between Mulgrave and the River
Tees. A mean Town to what it was, when it had its rich Abbey; but of some note
however, for being the first place where Alum was made in England. Not far
from which is Roseberry-Topping, a Hill Pyramid-like, serving to Sailers for a
Landmark, and being to the Country People a certain Sign of Rain, when they
see a Cloud over it. Almost at the top of it is a Spring of Water coming out of
a huge Rock, counted good for sore Eyes.

Stokesley is a Market Town well watered with fresh Streams. Yarum, but a mean
Town, is seated on the Tees, which divides this County from the Bishopric of
Durham, and over which it has a fair Stone Bridge. North-Allerton, a large
Borough-Town, stands near the Wisk, a small Stream that falls into the Swale.
And Thirsk is a small Borough-Town that had once a very strong Castle.

Bedal, Middleham, and Masham are all three in Richmondshire. The first, seated
on the Swale, and a small Stream that falls there into it, Middleham and
Masham, on the Your. And not far from Masham is Aldborough, an ancient
Borough-Town.

New Malton, Pickering, Kirby-Moreside, and Helmley, ly all four Eastward, not
far distant from each other, nor from the Sea. The first, a Borough-Town, is
seated on the Banks of the River Derwent, over which it has a Stone Bridge; and
contains 3 Parish Churches, being well-inhabited, and accommodated with good
Inns for Travelers. Its Market on Saturdays is counted one of the best in all
the County for Horses, living Cattle, Provisions, and most Country-Commodities,
especially Tools for Husbandry. The other three are all seated on small Rivers,
which after some small Course join together into one Stream, and so fall into
the Derwent, a little below New Malton.

To conclude, this County (formerly a Part of the Kingdom of Northumberland,
and its Inhabitants Part of the Brigantes, as the Romans called them,) is now
in the Diocese of York.

Out of it are elected, besides the two Knights of the Shire, 28 Members of
Parliament; Viz. Two by each of these following Towns, York, Kingston upon
Hull, Knaresborough, Scarborough, Rippon, Richmond, Heydon, Boroughbridge,
Malton, Thirsk, Aldborough, Beverly, North-Allerton, Pomfret.

And, which is remarkable, it yields at this time two Dukes, and one Duchess,
one Marquess, and nine Earls. The Dukes are of Richmond, and Bolton; the
Duchess, of Cleveland; the Marquess, of Halifax; the Earls, of Mulgrave,
Kingston, Strafford, Craven, Burlington, Holderness, Derwentwater, Faulconberg,
and Scarborough.

Thus I have compassed a very difficult Task, the Description of forty
Counties, with so much variety of Matter, in so short a Compass. The Reader
perhaps expects in the next place, I should give an Account of the Twelve
Counties of Wales, as being Incorporated with England, at least in point of
Government. But what Union soever it may have with England, it is but like those
remote Cities conquered by the Romans, whose Inhabitants were Civitate donati,
that is, made Citizens of Rome. England and Wales are naturally so distinct
from each other, both as to the Country and the Inhabitants, that they cannot
possibly fall under the same Character. And so I lay Wales aside to present
you, by way of Precapitulation, with a Table, showing by distinct Columns the
Number of Hundreds, Parishes, and Market Towns belonging to every County of
England, with the Names of the Shire-Towns. Only it is to be observed that,
instead of Hundreds, Durham is divided into Wakes; Cumberland, Westmorland, and
Northumberland, into Wards. Also, that some Counties are more generally divided
than into Hundreds; as Yorkshire, first into three Ridings, Kent into five
Lathes, Sussex into six Rapes, Linconshire into these three Parts, Lindsey,
Kesteven, and Holland.

CHAP. XVIII.
Of LONDON and WESTMINSTER.

I Join these two together, because contiguous. And, though they be two distinct
Cities, both by their Foundation and distinct Government; yet, as they make
together one compact Body, the City of Westminster, under that Notion, is
generally comprehended under the Name of London, and looked upon as a Part of
it. In the Description whereof, I shall join and part them, as occasion shall
offer.

My Design is not to make a long Preamble about the uncertain Original of
LONDON, which (as some write) was built above eleven hundred Years before the
Birth of our Savior. That it is a most ancient City, is a thing past all
doubt. For History tells us, that the British King Lud, above 60 Years before
our Saviors Birth, repaired and improved it. The Romans, in whose Time it was
an Archbishop's See, gave it the Title of Augusta. And Animianus Marcellinus,
who wrote near 1300 Years ago, calls it then an ancient City.

As for its Name, the most probable Conjecture in my Judgment is that of those
who derive it from the British Word Llongdin, a Town of Ships.

Its Situation is, upon all accounts, very advantageous, whether we consider
the Soil on which it stands, the River that waters it, the Fruitfulness of the
Country about it, the Roads that lead into it, or its convenient Distance from
the Sea.

The Soil is gravelly, and therefore so much the wholsomer. And, as it stands
upon a gentle rising Bank, on the North-side of the River, this adds much to
the healthfulness of the Place; the South Side being counted something
unhealthy by reason of the Vapors the Sun draws upon it.

The Thames that waters it I have already described, as the chief River of
England, and an excellent navigable River. This City stands where the River is
cast into the form of a Crescent; and stretches it self in length along the
Shore, as Cologne does upon the Rhine. Which is a great Advantage, upon several
Accounts, especially to a great City First, because it ly's the more convenient
for the several Uses and Benefits of the River. Secondly, for the Freeness of
the Air; which makes it so much the healthfuller; lying open to the Fields
Northward, and to the River Southward. Whereas Paris, and all other Cities of
an orbicular Form, ly close together, and the middle Parts half choackt for
want of Air. To which add another Convenience in London by its Situation along
the River, that by the Course of it one may sooner find out any Place than is
possible in Paris, which is a very Labyrinth in comparison.

This River besides is full of excellent Fish, such as Barbels, Trouts,
Chevins, Pearches, Smelts, Breams, Roaches, Daces, Gudgeons, Flounders,
Shrimps, Eels, etc. And, after the Smelt-time is past, it yields also sweet
Salmons. But Carps it is scarce of, except upon Land-flouds, when they get out
of Gentlemen's Ponds. Great number of Swans are daily seen upon this River.
Besides a perpetual Motion of Wherries and small Boats, above 2000 in Number,
whereby 3000 Watermen are maintained, by carrying Goods and Passengers thereon.
Not counting those large Tilt-Boats, Tide-Boats, and Barges, which either carry
People, or bring Provision from most Parts of the neighboring Counties.

For Navigation, no River more commodious, as may appear by a Passage in the
Reign of King James I. Who, being displeased with the City, for refusing to
lend him a Sum of Money he required, threatened the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, that
he would remove his Court, with all the Records of the Tower, and the Courts of
Westminster Hall, to another Place, with further expressions of his
Indignation. Your Majesty, answered the Lord Mayor calmly, may do what you
please therein, and your City of London will prove still dutiful; but she
comforts her self with the Thoughts, that your Majesty will leave the Thames
behind you.

This River besides is so Kind, that it seldom indamages any Part of this City
by its Overflowings. Here the highest Tides are upon a Land-floud, and the Moon
at full, when sometimes it does swell over its Banks. But then Westminster,
lying low, feels alone the effects of it, and that seldom further than the
Cellars. Whereas the Chambers and Upper Rooms at Rome and Paris are sometimes
overflowed, Rome by the Tiber, and Paris by the Seine.

From this River the City, by Water-Engines, is in many places supplied with
good Water. But, to serve with Water the North Parts of the City, as the Thames
does the South Parts, it has the Convenience of an artificial River, commonly
called the New River, which was begun Anno 1608, and finished in five Years
time. A noble Undertaking of Sir Hugh Middleton, who for this great Work
deserves his Statue in Brass. This River he brought from Amwell and Chadwell,
two Springs near Ware in Hartfordshire; from whence, in a turning and winding
Course, it runs near upon 60 miles, before it reaches this City. In this
Undertaking, fitter indeed for a Prince than any Subject, there have been six
hundred Men at once employed, which was a prodigious Charge. The Channel in
some Places 30 foot deep, in others carried over Valleys 20 foot at least above
Ground, in open Troughs. And over this River are 800 Bridges, some of Stone,
some of Wood, and others of Brick.

This City besides has the Convenience of several Conduits of Spring Water, so
commodiously placed, that they serve all the chief Parts of it. And it is so
situated, that in all Parts (though on the highest Ground) it is abundantly
served with Pump-Water, the Pumps in many Places not six foot deep in the
Ground.

For a constant Supply of Provisions, besides the fruitful County of
Middlesex, in which it stands, and that of Surrey on the other side of the
River (both which are ready at hand to furnish it with their Provisions) it is
neighboured with many other plentiful Counties, out of whose abundance this
City lives in great plenty, and seldom knows what Scarcity is.

The Conveyance so easy, both by Land and Water, that no City in Europe has
better Conveniences. So large, fair, and smooth are the High Ways that lead
from all Parts to it, and so convenient is the River, that almost all the Fuel
for firing is brought up that Way to Town. The Coals from Newcastle, and the
Wood from Kent and Essex; some of which last comes also down the River from
Surrey and Middlesex. Lastly, as it has the Command of the Sea, so there is
scarce any Blessing in the Terrestrial Globe but this City has her Share in it.

Moreover, its Distance from the Sea (which is about 60 Miles) is a great
Argument of the Founder's Wisdom. For, by that Distance, as it is not so near
as to be annoyed by the unwholsom Vapors of the Sea, or to be suddenly
surprised by an Enemies Fleet; so it is not so far but that, by the help of the
Tide (which comes up every 12 hours) Ships of great burden may be brought into
her bosom.

In point of Latitude, it is in 51 Degree, 30 Minutes.

I come now to its full Extent, with its Suburbs and Places adjacent. Its
Length from East to West, that is, from Lime-house to the further end of
Mill-Bank in Westminster, is above 7500 Geometrical Paces, which comes to seven
measured miles and an half, at 1000 paces a mile; that is, about five computed
miles, or two Parisian Leagues and a half. The Breadth indeed is not
proportionable, the City being built in Length for the Convenience of the
River. And yet, taking Southwark in on the other side of the River, as it is
under the Lord Mayor's Jurisdiction, and joined to London by the Bridge, this
vast City reaches there in Breadth, from North to South, that is, from the
further end of White-Chappel Street to St. George's Fields in Southwark, near
upon 3 miles. So that I cannot but conceive that, if London were cast (as
Paris) into an orbicular Form, the Circumference of it would be much larger
than that of Paris. So much it is increased in Buildings, since the dismal
Conflagration in the Year 1666.

But whether it is profitable to the Body of the State or not, to have so vast
a Head, may be made a Question. And, if Dr. Heylin had cause to complain in his
time of its being grown then too big for the Kingdom, he might with much more
reason do it now. Great Towns, says he, in the Body of a State are like the
Spleen or Milt in the Body natural. The monstrous Growth of which impoverishes
all the rest of the Members, by drawing to it all the animal and vital Spirits
which should give nourishment unto them; and in the end cracked or surcharged
by its own fullness, not only sends unwholsom Fumes and Vapors to the Head, and
heavy Pangs upon the Heart, but draws a Consumption on it self. He adds
further, that the Overgrowth of great Cities is of dangerous consequence, not
only in regard of Famine, such Multitudes of Mouths not being easy to be fed;
but in respect of the irreparable Danger of Insurrections, if once those
Multitudes, sensible of their own Strength, oppressed with Want, or otherwise
distempered with Faction or Discontent, should gather to a head, and break out
into Action.

These are all, I confess, very plausible Arguments. But, if we consider London
as it is in a manner the Head of three Kingdoms, at least the Seat of their
Monarch, I see nothing of Monstrousness in it. On the other side, London having
the Convenience of the Sea and of a navigable River, is so much the less
subject to a Famine; for that in case of Scarcity at home, it may be supplied
from abroad. And, as in so great a Body there be commonly different Parties led
by opposite Interests, so there is the less Cause to fear Insurrections,
because one Party keeps still another in aw. Just so Geneva and Hamburg, two
free Cities, do not subsist so much by their own Strength, as by the Jealousy
of the several States that neighbor upon 'em.

But the greatest Danger incident to great Cities (and omitted by Dr. Heylin)
is in Case of Contagious Diseases; Which, the more Matter they find to work
upon, make so much the greater havoc; and like a raging Fire, get strength by
their Motion. Witness the Year 1665, when at London there died of the Plague in
one day no less than 1200.

When all is done, I have this to urge in the behalf of great Cities, that they
are a visible Sign of a flourishing State, and such as draws Respect from its
Neighbors, who look upon it as the Luxuriancy and Result of its Wealth. And,
of all the Cities of Europe, none can so justly challenge the Preeminency in
this Point as London, the Metropolis of England; being not only perhaps the
most ancient, but also the wealthiest, and (reckoning all its Annexes) the
greatest City now extant in Europe.

Such a City as contains above 600 Streets, Lanes, Courts, and Alleys; and in
them all, by a late Computation, at least a hundred thousand Houses. So that,
allowing only 8 Persons to each House one with another, (which I think is
moderate) the Number of the Inhabitants will amount at that rate to above eight
hundred thousand Souls. Befides a World of Seamen, that live and swarm in that
constant (though moving) Forest of Ships down the River, on the East side of the
Bridge.

The Dwelling Houses raised since the Fire are generally very fair, and built
much more convenient and uniform than heretofore. Before the Fire, they were
most Timber Houses, built with little regard to Uniformity; but since the Fire,
Building of Bricks has been the general Way, and that with so much Art and
Skill in Architecture, that I have often wondered to see in well-compact Houses
so many Conveniences in a small compass of Ground. In short, our English
Builders have built so much of late Years, that no Nation perhaps at this time
can vy with them for making much of any Ground (though never so little) and
contriving all the Parts of it to the best advantage, in the neatest and most
regular way, with all the Conveniences the Ground can possibly afford. And that
which adds much to the Neatness of the late Buildings is the Wainscot, now so
much in use. Which, as it is the cleanest Furniture, so it is the most durable,
and indeed the most proper for so moist a Country.

If we come to Stateliness, I confess the Noblemens Houses at Paris, being
built of free Stone (as most of that City are) with large Courts before 'em for
the Reception of Coaches, make a fine outward Appearance. But, for uniformity,
state, and magnificence, we have some here, and chiefly Montague-House, that
exceed by far most of 'em. As for great Merchants Houses, and fair Taverns,
scarce any City surpasses London in this particular. For public Buildings, as
Halls, Inns of Court, Exchanges, Marketplaces, Hospitals, Colleges, Churches,
besides the Bridge upon the River, the Monument, Custom-House, and the Tower,
they are Things worth any Strangers Curiosity to view, at least a good part of
them. Most of which have indeed the disadvantage of being built backward, and
out of the way, to make room for Tradesmens Shops in the Streets. Whereas, if
they had been all built toward the Street, as generally they are in other
Countries, few Cities could make so great an Appearance.

But for stately, strait, and spacious Streets, (to pass by many curious
Courts) where shall one see finer than Cheapside, Cornhill, ^ombard-Street,
Fleet Street, Hatton Garden, Pallnall, and several others, especially near the
Court? What foreign City can show so many Piazzas, or fine Squares, such as
Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Lincolns-Inn-Square, Gray's Inn, Red Lion, and
Southampton-Squares, the Golden Square, King's Square in Sohoe, S. James's
Square, Leicester-Fields, and Covent Garden. The first of which is chiefly
noted for its Spaciousness, and King's Square for its Stateliness.

Lastly, when I reflect upon that disinal Fire, which in three Days time
consumed above thirteen thousand Houses (besides 89 Parish Churches, the vast
Cathedral of S. Paul, diverse Chapels, Halls, Colleges, Schools, and other
public Edifices) it is a matter of amazement to me to see how soon the English
recovered themselves from so great a Desolation, and a Loss not to be computed.
At 3 Years end near upon ten thousand Houses were raised up again from their
Ashes, with great Improvements. And by that time the fit of Building grew so
strong, that, besides a full and glorious Restoration of a City that a raging
Fire had lately buried in its Ashes, the Suburbs have been increased to that
degree, that (to speak modestly) as many more Houses have been added to it,
with all the Advantages that able and skillful Builders could invent, both for
Convenience and Beauty.

But it is time to come to Particulars The City, properly so called, is begirt
with a Wall, which gives entrance at seven principal Gates, besides Posterns of
later erection Viz. on the West Side Ludgate and Newgate, both which serve for
Prisons; the first, for such Debtors as are Freemen of the City the other for
Malefactors both of the City and Country, and is besides the County Goa^ for
Debt. Northwards, those of Aldersgate, Cripglegate, Moorgate, and Bishopsgate.
And Eastward, Aldgate.

Within the Compass of the Walls there are reckoned 97 Parishes; and in
relation to the Civil Government, the City within the Walls and Freedom is
divided into 26 Wards or Aldermanries, of which more hereafter.

As to the public Buildings here, I shall begin with the Tower, a Fort upon
the Thames, which commands both the City and River. Called the Tower, from the
great white Tower in the middle, which gives Name to the Whole. It Is all
surrounded with a Wall and Ditch about a mile in compass, with Cannon planted
on the Walls, and the Turrets thereof. But it is besides the principal
Storehouse of England for Arms and Ammunition, such as is said to contain Arms
for about 60000 Men.

Here are also kept the Jewels and Ornaments of the Crown, and the ancient
Records of the Nation. As among others, the Original of all the Laws that have
been enacted or recorded till the Reign of Richard II. The Grants of several
Kings to their Subjects at home and abroad, and the Confirmations thereof. The
several Treaties and Leagues with foreign Princes. The Dominion of the British
Seas. The Title of the Kings of England to the Kingdom of France, and how
obtained. All the Achievements of this Nation in France, and other foreign
Parts. The Homage and Dependency of Scotland upon England. The Establishment of
Ireland in Laws and Dominions. These, and many other Records, are reposited in
Wakefield Tower, near the Traitors Gate, under the Custody of an Officer,
called the Keeper of the Records, and whose Salary is 500 l. per Annum. This
Place is properly in the Master of the Rolls his Gift.

Every day of the Week (except Sundays, Holy Days, public Fasting, and
Thanksgiving-Days, and Times of great Pestilence) they that have occasion to
look into the Records have admittance. In the Morning from 7 to 11 a clock, and
in the Afternoon from one till five. Except in the Months of December, January,
and February, where Attendance is not given till 8 in the Morning, and in the
Afternoon not beyond 4 a clock.

In the Tower is the only Mint of England, for Coining of Gold and Silver. To
which belong several Offices, which I intend to muster in my second Part, where
I shall speak of the English Coyns.

Lastly, the Tower, which has been formerly honored with the Residence of
several Kings, who kept their Courts here, is now the chief Prison, where
Persons of quality that are charged with Crimes against the Government are kept
in Custody.

Here are also many Dwelling-Houses for the Officers that belong to it, either
as a^ Arsenal, or a Mint, etc. And, as an Arsenal here is kept the Office of
his Majesty's O^dinance, to be explained in my second Part For the public
Devotion of all the Dwelle^^ in the Tower there is within its Walls on^
Parochial Church, called S. Petri ad Vincul^ infra Turrim, being the Kings
Donative without Institution and Induction, and exemp^ from all Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction of the Archbishop.

The Government of the Tower, as it is a Place of great Trust, so it has been
usually put in the hands of two Persons of great worth, the one called
Constable, and the other Lieutenant of the Tower. The Constable has the chief
Command, and is Lord Lieutenant of the 21 Hamlets belonging to it, which ly in
several Parishes of large extent. Whose Train-bands, making two entire
Regiments of Foot, and above 3000 Men, are to attend the Kings Person when
commanded, but are to march no farther than the King. They were sometimes the
Gards of the Tower, and are bound (if occasion be) to reinforce the Garrison,
upon the Constable's Command. Who, by his Place is to be in the Commission of
the Peace for the City of London, and the Counties of Middlesex, Kent, and
Surrey. And so is the Lieutenant, who is subordinate, to the Constable for the
time being, but in his absence commands with the full Power of both. His Salary
is 200 l. per annum, with all the Fees and Perquisites, which are very
considerable, both from the Prisoners that happen to be in the Tower, and from
the Warders Places, which are all at his Disposal.

Under the Command of the Constable, and the Lieutenant of the Tower in his
absence, are the Gentleman Porter, the 24 ^eomen Warders, and the Gunners of
the Tower.

The Gentleman Porter (who holds his Place by Patent) has the Charge of the
Gates. The Keys whereof he is every night to deliver to the Constable, and in
his absence to the Lieutenant, and to receive them of him the next morning. He
commands the Warders that are upon duty, and claims for his Fee at the entrance
of a Prisoner his Upper Garment, or else a Composition for the same.

The Warders are accounted the King's Domestic Servants, and sworn accordingly
by the Lord High Chamberlain, or by the Clerk of the Check. Their Duty is to
wait at the Gates, and by the Lieutenant of the Tower's appointment to attend
Prisoners of State, which is the most profitable and beneficial part of their
Station. At the Gates they examine every Stranger that offers to go in, and
before admittance (according to the Rules of Military Discipline) those that
^ear Swords must leave 'em in their hands, ^ill they go out. Ten of them are
usually upon the Days Wait, and two upon the Watch ^very night.

The Gunners are to look after the Ord^ance mounted on the Batteries and Lines,
and ready for Service on the shortest Warning. One or more of them are upon
Duty ^ay and night, to wait for Orders.

For the Liberty of the Tower (to which ^as been annexed the old Artillery
Garden ^y Spittle-Fields, and the little Minories) here is an ancient Court of
Record; held by a Steward every Monday by Prescription, for Debts, Trespasses,
etc. And in the said Liberty the Gentleman Porter has the same Power and
Authority as Sheriffs have within their respective Counties. He constitutes
Bailiffs thereof, to execute all Process and Warrants directed to them by the
Steward of the Court; and has all Escheats, Deodands, and Goods of all Felones
de^se.

For Ecclesiastical Causes and Probate of Wills, the Tower and Liberties
thereof have a Royal Jurisdiction. From which there is no Appeal but to the
King in his Court of Chancery; who thereupon issues out a Commission under the
Great Seal, as in Appeals from the Arches or Prerogative Courts.

But, whether the Tower be in the County (that is under the Jurisdiction) of
Middlesex, or in the Liberty of the City, it is undetermined to this day. Some
will have it to be part of it in Middlesex, and part in the Liberty of the
City. And in the Case of Sir Thomas Overbury's Murder, the Judges Opinion was,
that the Trial must be made in the City, the Fact being done in that Part of
the Tower held to be in the City Liberties.

Next to the Tower, I come to the Custom House, placed between the Tower and
the Bridge. Which, having been destroyed by the Fire in the Year 1666, was soon
afte^ rebuilt much more commodious, uniform, an^ magnificent; and the Building
cost the Kin^ 10000 pounds.

Here are received and managed all the Impositions laid upon Merchandise
Imported, and Exported from this City. Which are so considerable, that, of all
the Customs of England divided into 3 Parts, the Port of London pay's two
Thirds, that is (when Trade flourishes) about 400000 l. yearly.

In this Office are employed a great Number of Officers, an Account whereof you
will find in my Second Part, where I speak of the King's Revenues.

The Bridge of London offers it self in the next place to our Consideration.
Which, considering the constant great Flux and Reflux at that Place, was
certainly a very difficult and costly piece of Work. It consists of 19 Arches,
at 20 foot distance of each other, with a Drawbridge almost in the middle It Is
about 800 foot long, and 30 broad. Set out with a fine Row of Houses all along,
with Shops furnished with most sorts of Commodities. So that it looks more like
a Street than a Bridge, the Street being widened in the late Reign from 12 to
20 foot. It was built in the year 1200, in the Reign of King John. And so great
are the Charges of keeping it in repair, that there is a large Revenue in Lands
and Houses set apart for that purpose, and two Bridge-Masters (besides other
Officers) chosen out of the Liverv-men on Midsummer-Day to look after the same.

Near this Bridge is the fatal Place where the dreadful Fire aforementioned
first began. In perpetual^ Memory whereof was erected, by virtue of an Act of
Parliament, that ^aster-piece of Building, called the Monument, begun Anno
1671, in the Mayoralty of Sir Richard Forde Knight, and finished Anno 1677, Sir
Thomas Davies being Lord Mayor of London. This Pillar, not unlike those two
ancient white Marble Pillars at Rome, erected in honor of the Emperors Trajan
and Antonius, is all built of Portland Stone, as durable almost as Marble; and
is of the Dorick Order, 202 foot high, and 15 foot Diameter. Within-side is a
fair winding Staircase, with Iron rails up to the top; where this stately Pile
is surrounded with an Iron-Balcony, yielding a pleasant Prospect all over the
City. The Pedestal is 40 foot high, and 21 foot Square; the Front of it adorned
with ingenious Emblems, and the North and Southsides with these two Latin
Inscriptions.

same thus Englished by Dr. Chamberlain.

In the Year of Christ 1666, the second Day of September, Eastward from hence,
at the Distance of Two hundred and two foot (the height of this Column) a
terrible Fire broke out about Midnight; which driven on by a high Wind, not
only wasted the adjacent Parts, but also very remote Places, with incredible
noise and fury. It consumed eighty nine Churches, the City-Gates, Guildhall,
many public Structures, Hospitals, Schools, Libraries, a vast Number of
stately Edifices, Thirteen thousand two hundred Dwelling-houses, four hundred
Streets. Of the six and twenty Wards it utterly destroyed fifteen, and left
eight others shattered and half-burnt. The Ruins of the City were four hundred
thirty six Acres, from the Tower by the Thames-side to the Temple-Church, and
from the North-East Gate along the City-Wall to Holborn-Bridge. To the Estates
and Fortunes of the Citizens it was merciless, but to their Lives very
favorable, that it might in all things resemble the last Conflagration of the
World. The Destruction was sudden, for in a small space of time the same City
was seen most flourishing, and reduced to nothing. Three days after, when this
fatal Fire had baffled all humane Counsels and Endeavors in the Opinion of
all, it stopped as it were by a Command from Heaven, and was on every side
extinguished. The other Inscription runs thus, on the other side.

celeritate an splendore incertum, unum Triennium absolvit quod Saeculi Opus
credebatur. In English, thus.

Charles II. Son of Charles the Martyr, King of Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, Defender of the Faith, a most gracious Prince, Commiserating the
deplorable state of Things, whilst the Ruins were yet smoking, provided for
the Comfort of his Citizens, and the Ornament of his City; Remitted their
Taxes, and referred the Petitions of the Magistrates and Inhabitants to the
Parliament; who immediately passed an Act, that public Works should be
restored to greater Beauty with public Money, to be raised by an Imposition on
Coals; That Churches and the Cathedral of S. Paul's should be Rebuilt from
their Foundations, with all Magnificence; That Bridges, Gates, and Prisons
should be new made, the Sewers cleansed, the Streets made strait and regular,
such as were steep levelled, and those too narrow made wider; Markets and
Shambles removed to separate Places. They also Enacted, that every House should
be built with Party Walls, and all in Front raised of equal height, and those
Walls all of square Stone or Brick, and that no man should delay Building
beyond the space of seven Years. Moreover, Care was taken by Law, to prevent
all Suits about their Bounds. Also anniversary Prayers were enjoined; and, to
perpetuate the Memory hereof to Posterity, they caused this Column to be
erected. The Work was carried on with diligence, and London is restored; but,
whether with greater speed or beauty, may be made a question. At three years
time the World sees that finished, which was supposed to be the Business of an
Age. From the Monument I come now to the Royal Exchange, the finest Building of
this kind in Europe. First erected in the year 1566 (just one hundred years
before it was burnt) at the Cost and Chargers of a noble Merchant, Sir Thomas
Gresham; and, by the special Command of Queen Elizabeth, proclaimed in a solemn
manner by the Name of the Royal Exchange. But then it was built most of Brick;
and now all of freestone within and without, with admirable Architecture.

The same is Quadrangular, with a stately Front to it, and a high Turret at the
top, with a Chime of 12 Bells. Within is a large Court, wherein the Merchants
meet daily about one a Clock; and all round it fine arched Galleries or Walks,
for a Shelter in case of Rain, or hot Sun-shiny Weather.

In the middle of the Court stands a fine Statue of white Marble, upon a
Pedestal 7 foot high. It Is the Statue of King Charles II, done with great
beauty and spirit in the ancient Habit of the Roman Caesar's, with a Wreath of
Laurel on his Head. The Work of Mr. Gibbons, (a most skillful Artist,) at the
charge of the Merchant Adventurers of England.

But the greatest Ornament of this Place is in the Niches above, where the
Kings of England from William the Conqueror are now partly set up, till the
rest can be finished.

Above Stairs is the Exchange, chiefly for wearing Apparel. It consists of
almost 200 Shops, where the richest sort of Commodities are sold, both for Use
and Ornament.

The whole Fabric cost above 50000 l. whereof one half being disbursed by the
Chamber of London, and the other by the Company of Mercers, they now reimburse
themselves by the Rent of the Shops above and below Stairs, and the vaulted
Cellars under Ground. Which comes to about 4000 l. a Year, besides 30 l. Fine,
which is paid for every Shop. And, as Dr. Chamberlain observes, this goodly
Fabric not taking up quite an Acre of Ground, is perhaps the richest piece of
Ground in the whole World.

In our Way toward Westminster, before we come to St. Paul's Cathedral, are
three Things worth taking notice of. On the left hand, a Statute of King
Charles II. on Horseback in Stock-Market, with a fine Conduit to it, Bow
steeple in the middle of Cheapside, and on the right hand the Guildhall. The
first done in white Marble, at the Cost and Charges of Sir Robert Viner. The
other a solid and beautiful Structure, composed of four of the Orders of
Building, which shows the rare Invention of the Architect. The whole Height of
it from the Ground is 225 foot, and yet is but half so high as the intended
Dome of St. Paul's Cathedral is designed to be. Noted besides for its Ring of
Bells, reputed to be the best in all England. Guildhall, where the the City
Courts of Judicature are held; and where the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and
Common Council meet for the Management of the City-Concerns, is a spacious
Building, but more glorious within than without. At the first coming in is a
spacious Hall, set out (among other Things) with the Pictures of Their
Majesty's King William and Queen Mary, with those of several Judges. Here are
also two Giauts, that stand up in their bulky Figures.

Blackwell-Hall is so near this Place, and so famous for the Sale of
Woollen-Cloths, that I cannot pass it by in Silence. The same was purchased by
the Lord Mayor and Commonalty in the Beign of Richard II, and has been since
employed as a Weekly Marketplace for all sorts of Woollen-Cloth, broad and
narrow, brought from all Parts of the Kingdom there to be sold. And it is to
this day the greatest Market and Storehouse for all sorts of Woolen-Cloth.

And now we come to St. Paul's Cathedral, seated on the highest Part of all the
City, and first built by Sebert, the first Christian King of the East Saxons.
Before the Fire it was in Length 690 Foot, that is 20 foot longer than St.
Peter's in Rome, which for beauty, proportion, and diverse other Things, excels
all other Churches. Its Breadth and Height were proportionable to the Length,
so that it stood upon so much ground as contained above 3 Acres and a half.
This famous Church, as vast and solid as it was, was devoured by that dreadful
Fire in the Year 1666. But, some Years after, Sir Christopher Wren having, by
the King's Command, designed a new Model of it, a new Foundation was laid
accordingly. And, ever since, this stately Fabric has been carried on to that
height we see it now. So that for Greatness and Figure, for Solidity,
Magnificence, and curious-Architecture, it is like to excel all Churches in
Christendom, except in some particulars St. Peter's Church in Rome. To this
Cathedral belongs a Dean, and thirty Prebendaries, etc.

Within the Liberties, The Two Sergeants Inns, one in Fleetstreet, and the
other in Chancery Lane. Two Inns of Court, the Inner and the Middle Temple, in
Fleetstreet. Five Inns of Chancery, viz. Clifford's-Inn in Fleetstreet, and
these four in Ho^born, Thavies, Furnivals, Bernards, and Staple-Inns.


Without the Liberties, Two other Inns of Court, viz. Grays Inn in Holborn, and
Lincolns Inn in Chancery Lane. Three Inns of Chancery, viz. Clements Inn, New
Inn, and Iyons Inn.


The Sergeants Inns are so called, because diverse Judges and Sergeants at Law
keep their Commons and Lodge there in Termtime. The Number of these is about
26, who being arrived to the highest Degree in the Study of the Common Law,
have here their Lodging and Diet. Out of these are all the Judges of the Kings
Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer elected by the King; ^t being a Degree in
the Common Law an^werable to that of Doctor in the Civil Law. But, whereas
Doctors of Law are allowed to it covered within the Bar, the Sergeants stand
^are-headed without the Bar, only with Coifs ^or Caps) on. For they are called
Servientes (...) Legem; and Servitutis Appellatio-est Ministe^ii, Doctoris vero
Magisterii.

The Degrees by which the Student in the ^ommon Law rises to that of a Sergeant
are first, by being bred 2 or 3 years in the University, in the Study of Logic
and Rhetoric, with some Insight into the Civil Law. Upon which he is admitted
to one of the four Inns of Court, where he is first called a Student, or
Inner-Barrister, till after 7 Years Study he becomes a Mootman or
Utter-Barrister, and some Years after a Bencher.

Those are Utter-Barristers, who from their Learning and Standing are called by
the Benchers, in the Mooting Time, to plead and argue Moots, that is doubtful
Cases and Questions. And, whilst they argue the said Cases, they sit uttermost
on the Forms of the Benchers. Out of these Mootmen, are chosen Readers for the
Inns of Chancery, where in Term-Time and Grand Vacations they argue Cases in
the presence of Attorneys and Clerks. In the four Inns of Chancery seated in
Holbourn, the Moots are read either by those of Gray's Inn, or Lincoln's Inn; and
in the others, by those of the two Temples.

The Benchers, so called from the Bench whereon they sit at the upper end of
the Hall, are the Seniors, to whom is committed the Government of the whole
House; and out of whose Number is yearly chosen a Treasurer, who receives,
disburses, and accounts for all Moneys belonging to the House. Out of these are
also chosen those Readers, whose Reading is kept with so much feasting and
solemnity. To which are invited the chief Nobles, Judges, Bishops, great
Officers of the Kingdom, and sometimes the King himself. Such a Feasting as has
cost some Readers 1000 l. After which the Reader wears a long Rob^different
from other Barristers, and is then in a capacity to be made a Sergeant at Law,
the Sergeants being usually chosen out of these Readers.

The Manner of their Choice is thus. When the Number of Sergeants is small, the
Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, by the advice and consent of the other
Judges, makes choice of some of the most grave and learned of the Inns of
Court, and presents their Names to the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper. Who
sends, by the King's Writ, to each of them, to appear on such a day before the
King, to receive the State and Degree of a Sergeant at Law. At the appointed
Time, they, being habited in partycoloured Robes, come to Westminster Hall,
accompanied with the Students of the Inns of Court, and attended by a Train of
Servants and Retainers in their Cloth Liveries. Where they take in public a
solemn Oath, and are clothed with Coifs, which they wear always in public.
After this, they feast the great Persons of the Nation in a most splendid
manner, and present them with gold Rings, according to their Quality. Out of
these Sergeants the King calls by Writ some of them to be of his Council at
Law. These fit within the Bar in all Courts at Westminster, except in the
Common Pleas.

The Inns of Court are so called, either because the Students therein are to
serve the Courts of Judicature, or elfe (as Fortescue affirms) because these
Colleges received only the Sons of Noblemen and better sort of Gentlemen. They
are the largest and the most beautiful Inns; Gray's Inn particularly being
beautified of late with a fine Square, and another being now building in
Lincoln's Inn, which will be a great Set-off and Ornament to it.

The Two Temples (heretofore the Dwelling of the Knights Templers, purchased
above 300 years since by some Professors of the Common Law) are called the
Inner and Middle Temple, in relation to Essex-House, now built up into Streets.
Which House was part of the Knights Templers, and called the Outer-Temple,
because seated without Temple Bar.

Lincolns Inn is so called from the ancient Earls of Lincoln, whose House it
was; and Gray's Inn, from the noble Family of the Grays, to whom it formerly
belonged.

In these four Inns of Court are reckoned about 800 Students.

The Inns of Chancery were heretofore preparatory Colleges for younger
Students; where they were usually entered, before they could be admitted into
the Inns of Court. Now they are for the most part taken up by Attorneys,
Sollicitors, and Clerks; who have here their Chambers apart, and their Diet at
an easy rate. Here they eat in a Hall together, where they are obliged to
appear in their Robes, and black round knit Caps.

These Inns belong to the Inns of Court, some to one, some to another. As
Bernard's and Staple-Inns to Grays Inn, Thavies and Furnival's to Lincoln's Inn,
and the rest to the two Temples. Accordingly the Inns of Court send yearly some
of their Barristers to Read in those Colleges, all which one with another
contain about 500 Lawyers.

Cliffords Inn, among the rest, was anciently the House of the Lord Clifford,
from whence it is so denominated; Staple Inn belonged to the Merchants of the
Staple; and Lions Inn was anciently a common Inn with the Sign of the Lion.

But, besides those 8 Inns of Chancery, there is another in Chancery Lane,
known by the Name of Symonds Inn, being formerly a public Inn kept by one
Symond. This is an Inn by it self, belonging to no Inn of Court, nor living
under any Rules, such as the other Inns live under.

Now it is to be observed, that the foresaid Societies are no Corporations, and
have no Judicial Power over their Members. Only they have among themselves
certain Orders, which by Consent have the force of Laws. Neither have they any
Lands or Revenues, as Societies; and, for the defraying the Charges of the
House, they have but what is paid at Admittances, and Quit-rents for their
Chambers. At the Colledge-Chappel, or Hall, and ^ll Courts of Judicature, they
wear a black Robe and Cap; at other times they walk in Gentlemen's Habit. For
light Offenses they ^re only Excommoned, and not to eat with the rest. For
great Offenses they lose their Chambers, and are expelled the College; and,
being once expelled, they are never received by any of the three other
Societies.

But, besides all the foresaid Inns, which ^re for the Common Law and Chancery,
here (...) also a College of Civilians, called Doctors ^ommons. For, though
Degrees in the Civil ^aw may be taken only in Oxford and Camridge, and the
Theory best there to be acquired; yet the Practice thereof is most of all in
London. Where this College (standing near S. Paul's, in the Parish of S.
Bennets Pauls-Wharf) was founded by Dr. Harvey. Dean of the Arches, for the
Professors of the Civil Law in this City. And here did commonly reside the
Judge of the Arches, the Judge of the Admiralty, and the Judge of the
Prerogative Court, with diverse other eminent Civilians. From whose living, for
Diet and Lodging, in a Collegiate manner, and Commoning together, it got the
Name of Doctors Commons. This College, in the time of the great Fire, being
involved in the Ruins of the City, they all removed to Exete^ House in the
Strand. Till that being rebuilt, at their own proper Costs and Charges, in a
more convenient and splendid manner than before they returned to it. Where they
no^ keep their several Courts and Pleadings every Term.

But London being in a manner an University, there are in it several other
Colleges worth our taking notice.

I begin with the College of Physicians, which stood formerly in Knight-Rider
Street; and was the Gift of Dr. Linacre, Physician to King Henry VIII. Since
which a House and Ground was purchased by the Society of Physicians at the end
of Amen-Street, whereon a stately Structure for a Library and a public^ Hall
was erected by Dr. Harvey, Anno 1652. who endowed the same with his whole
Inheritance, which he resigned while he wa^ yet living and in health. But this
goodly Edifice could not escape the rage of the gr^^ Fire. And that Ground
being but a Lease the Society purchased a Piece of Ground in Warwick Lane near
Newgate, whereon they have raised the present College, a magnificent Edifice.

The Physicians of this College have, by Charters and Acts of Parliament, such
Privileges as exclude all others (though Graduates in Physic, of Oxford or
Cambridge) from practicing Physic in London, or within 7 miles of it, without
a License under the Colledge-Seal. And all Offenders in that Case, and diverse
others, they may fine, and imprison. They have Authority to search all the
Shops of Apothecaries in and about London, to see if their Drugs and
Compositions are wholesome and well made. And, by virtue of the said Charters,
they are freed from all troublesome Offices, as to serve upon Juries, to be
Constable, to keep Watch and Ward, to bear Arms, or provide Arms or Ammunition,
etc.

This College does chiefly consist of Fellows and Candidates; besides the
honourary Fellows, and Licentiates. The Number of Fellows is always to be
forty, besides the King's Physicians. And, when any Fellow dies, or leaves this
City, the next Candidate succeeds to make up the Number. But the Candidates,
before their Admission, are strictly examined (or at least ought to be so) in
all Parts of Physic. The honourary Fellows and Licentiates do both enjoy the
Privileges of the College, but have no share in the Government.

The Title of Honourary was first bestowed on some worthy Physicians who were
unwilling or unable to come in by the right Line of Candidates. The Licentiates
are such as for want of sufficient Learning, etc. are judged unfit to be
received into the Number of Fellows or Candidates. Yet, because they may be
serviceable to the Public, and do good at least in some sorts of Diseases,
they are, after due Examination and Approbation, licensed to practice.

Of this College there is a President, four Censors, and eight Elects, who are
all principal Members of the Society. Out of these one is chosen every Year to
preside, and Michaelmas is the Time of Election. But, if the President chance
to die before, the eldest Fellow has full power to execute his Place till the
next Election. As for the Censors, it is their province to look to and correct
those Interlopers that practice without Authority. Whose Number in London is
great, and yet connived at, according to the Rule, Si Populus vult decipi,
decipiatur. But one would wonder there should be so many, considering the
Hazard both they and their Patients do run by their Practice. They by the Law
of England, which makes it Felony in any one presuming to practice Physic
without Authority, whose Patient dies under his hand.

The next College of note is That of the Heralds, commonly called the Heralds
Office, being upon S. Bennets Hill, near Doctors Commons. An ancient House,
first built by that Earl of Darby who married the Mother of Henry VII, and
bestowed by Queen Mary on the Kings Heralds and Pursevants at Arms for ever.
The greatest Part of which is rebuilt since the great Fire, which laid it in
Ashes. Where some Officers of Arms do give a constant Attendance, to satisfy
all Comers touching Descents, Pedigrees, Coats of Arms, etc.

Within the Walls of London (in Bishops-Gate Street) is also seated the
College called Gresham College, from his Founder Sir Thomas Gresham, who also
built the Royal Exchange. After the Building whereof he gave one Moity of its
Revenue to the Mayor and Commonalty of London, and their Successors; the other
Moiety, to the Company of Mercers in trust, that the Mayor and Aldermen should
find in all Time to come four able Persons to read within this College
Divinity, Geometry, Astronomy, and Music, allowing each of them (besides their
Lodgings) 50 l. a year; and that the Company of Mercers should find three more
able Men to read Civil Law, Physic, and Rhetoric, with the same Allowance as
to the former. The said Lecturers to read in Termtime every Day in the Week
(except Sundays) Aforenoon in Latin, and Afternoon the same in English; the
Music Lecture to be read only in English.

This College is noted besides, for being the Meeting Place of that famous
Society of Virtuoso's called the Royal-Society; made a Corporation by virtue of
a Charter King Charles II. granted them, bearing date the 22th of April 1663.
It consists of a President, a Countil, and several Fellows; among which there
is a Treasurer, two Secretaries, and a Number of Curators or Experimentors.
Their Business is, by Experiments to promote the Knowledge of Natural Things,
and useful Arts; which they have hitherto done in a great measure. For, by the
great Number of their Experiments and Inventions, they have mightily improved
the Naval, Civil, and Military Architecture, but especially the Art of
Navigation. They have also inconraged Husbandry to that degree, that not only
England, but many other Countries, and even the remotest of our foreign
Plantations, feel the sweet effects of it. But, besides those Experiments of
Fruit and Profit, they have made many curious Discoveries, such as the learned
Lord Bacon calls Experiments of Light. And, if they have not answered to the
full the Expectation of some People in point of Usefulness, they have at least
very industriously laid a solid Groundwork for future Ages to improve
Experimental Knowledge.

Therefore King Charles gave them for their Coat of Arms a Scutcheon, with 3
Lions of England in chief, intimating that the Society was Royal; for the Crest
an Eagle, and for the Supporter hunting Hounds, to intimate the Sagacity
employed in penetrating and searching after the Works of Nature. And His
Majesty was pleased, for the Credit of the Society, to list himself amongst
them.

Their Meeting is upon Wednesdays, at 3 a Clock in the Afternoon. And the
Office of the President is to call and dissolve the Meetings, to propose the
Matter to be considered of, to put Questions, and call for Experiments, to
admit the Members that from time to time shall be elected, etc. The Treasurer
receives, and disburses all Moneys. The Secretaries read all Letters and
Informations both from England and foreign Parts, directed to the Society, and
make such Returns as the Society thinks fit. They take notice of the Orders and
material Passages at the Meetings, segister all Experiments, all certain
Informations, all Conclusions, etc. and publish whatsoever is ordered and
allowed by the Society. Lastly, the Curators are to receive the Directions of
the Society, and at another Meeting they bring all to the Test, the Society
being Judges thereof. Whereby the World has the concurring Testimony of many
Persons of undoubted Credit for the Truth of what they publish.

The Council consists of 21 Members, eleven whereof are to be continued for the
next Year, and the other ten to be chosen yearly upon the Feast of St. Andrew
in the Morning. After which they all dine together at a Venison-Feast.

The Manner of electing their Fellows is by Ballotting, according to the
Venetian way. The Candidate is proposed at one Assembly by some that know him
well, and the next he may be put to the Scrutiny. To carry it, he must have the
major Number of 21 Suffrages at the least. And then at that, or the next
Assembly, he may be introduced, and solemnly admitted by the President. At his
Admission he subscribes this Promise, That he will endeavor to promote the
Good of the Royal Society of London, for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge;
pays to the Treasurer only 40 Shillings, and so long as he continues a Member
13 Shillings a Quarter. But he may at any time free himself from this
Obligation, by signifying under his hand to the President that he desires to
withdraw from the Society.

Of this Society there have been all along, and are still, Persons of the
highest Rank, and many eminent Gentlemen and Doctors, both English and
Foreiners, sober, learned, solid, and ingenious Persons. Who, though of
different Degrees, Religions, Countries, Professions, Trades, and Fortunes;
yet, laying aside all Names of Distinction, have united together, amicably to
promote Experimental Knowledge. Among which I cannot but make particular
mention of the Honorable Mr. Robert Boil, the Glory of England, and the Oracle
of Europe in point of Philosophy.

In this College is the Repository, consisting of many Rarities of Nature,
some of 'em brought from the furthest Corners of the World. Such as Beasts,
Birds, Fishes, Serpents, Flies, Shells, Feathers, Seeds, Minerals, Mummies,
Gums, some things petrified, others Ossify'd, etc.

The last College I am to speak of is another also within London, called Sion
College, near Cripplegate. Founded by Thomas White, Doctor in Divinity, for
the Use of the Clergy of London, and the Liberties thereof; and part for 20
poor People. To perform all which he gave 3000 l; and for the maintenance of
those Poor, he settled 120 l. a year for ever. Besides 40 l. a year for a
Sermon in Latin, at the beginning of every Quarter, and a plentiful Dinner
for all the Clergy that shall then meet there.

In this College (now repaired, since the dreadful Fire) is a fair spacious
Library, built by John Sympson Rector of St. Olaves Heart-street, and one of
the said Founder's Executors. Which Library, by the Bounty o^ diverse
Benefactors, has been well furnished with Books, especially such as relate to
Divinity.

There are likewise in London diverse Public Schools endowed, as St. Paul's,
Merchant Tailors, Mercers Chapel, etc. which in other Countries would be
styled Colleges. But especially Paul's School, a commodious and stately
Building at the East end of St. Paul's Ca. thedral. Founded in the Year 1512.
by John Collet, Dr. of Divinity, and Dean of St. Paul's, for 153 Children to be
taught there gratis. For which purpose he appointed a Master, a Sub-Master or
Usher, and a Chaplain, with large Stipends for ever; committing the Oversight
thereof to the Masters, Wardens, and Assistants of the Mercers in London, his
Father Henry Collet (sometime Lord Mayor of London) having been of their
Company.

Moreover, for the Correction of Vagabonds, and other Persons of a loose Life
and Conversation, there are several Workhouses. The principal of which is
Bridewell near Fleet-Bridge. A stately Building, first built by King Henry
VIII. for the Reception of the Emperor Charles the fifth, but since converted
to this Use. And, for Trying of Malefactors, there is in the Old Bailey the
Sessions House, which may go with the rest among the Ornaments of this glorious
City, as unpleasant as it is to many people that are there tried for their
Lives.

Within the Precincts of Westminster are also many Things worthy our
Observation.

I begin with Whitehall, belonging heretofore to Cardinal Woolsey, and since
his Time become the usual Place of Residence of the English Monarchs. It Is
seated betwixt the Thames on the East and a fine Park on the West, amidst the
Pleasures of the Water, and the Charms of a fine spacious Spot of Ground. The
River of one side affording a great deal of Variety by the Multitude of Boats
that cover it; the Park on the other side charming the Eye with its delicate
Walks, well gravelled and as well shadowed, parted with a fine Canal in the
middle, and this fronted with a brazen Statue, which for curious Workmanship is
admired by Artists themselves.

As for Whitehall it self, I confess its outward Appearance is not great, but
it is very convenient, and more glorious within than without. And yet the
Chamber at the front of it, called the Banqueting House, is such a Piece of
Building as for Spaciousness, Beauty, Painting, and exact Proportion, is not to
be parallelled by any King in Europe; the Cieling whereof was all painted by
the hand of the famous Sir Peter Paul Rubens. Here is also, besides the
Protestant Chapel, a neat one built by the late King James for his Use, which
by the Grace of God ly's now dormant. And in one of the Courts stands his
Brazen Statue, which has had better luck than that of Newcastle upon Tine.

On the North-West side of the Park is another Royal Palace, called St. James,
which gives name to the Park. In the Strand is another Palace, called
Somerset House, where the Queen Dowager resides, and keeps her Dourt. This was
built by Edward, Duke of Somerset, Uncle to King Edward the fixth.

But the Glory of Westminster is the Abbey-Church there, founded before the
Norman Conquest by King Edward the Confessor, and most richly endowed;
afterward rebuilt from the Ground by King Henry III. This huge Fabric stands
on that piece of Ground which formerly was called Thorney-Island; then
surrounded with Water, and where of old stood a Temple dedicated to Apollo. In
this Church is usually performed the Coronation of our Kings, with that Pomp
and Magnificence as becomes such potent Monarchs. On the East end of it is
Henry the Sevenths Chapel, built by that King with admirable artificial Work
both within and without. And here are the Tombs and Monuments of several of our
Kings and Queens, among which that of massy Brass is so curiously wrought, that
it is scarcely to be parallelled.

The Abbey was converted into a Collegiate Church by Queen Elizabeth, who
placed therein a Dean, and 12 Prebendaries; besides about 30 petty Canons and
others, belonging to the Quire. The Dean is entrusted with the Custody of the
Regalia at the Coronation, and honored with a Place of necessary Service at
all Coronations.

Adjoining to this Church is a famous School and College called Westminster
School, a Seminary for the Universities. The College consists of 40 Scholars,
commonly called Kings Scholars; who, being chosen out of the School, and put
into the College, are there maintained. And, as they are fitted for the
University, they are yearly elected away, and placed with good Allowances in
Christ-Church College in Oxford, and Trinity College in Cambridge.

Here is also in the Cloisters a fair public Library, free for all Strangers
to study both Morning and Afternoon always in Termtime.

Next this Church stood the Royal Palace of the Kings of England, a great Part
whereof was burnt down in the Time of Henry VIII. What remained has still been
employed for the Use of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, and for
the chief Courts of Judicature. The great Hall where these are kept, commonly
called Wesiminster-Hell, is 270 foot in length, and 74 in breadth, for its
Dimensions not to be equalled by any Hall in Christendom. And were it set out
according to its Greatness and the Dignity of the Courts that are kept there,
it might pass for one of the most remarkable Buildings in Europe. Erected, as
some say, by King William Rufus; or, according to others, by Richard II, about
3^0 years ago.

But this is not all that Westminster affords wor^h our taking notice. The
Brazen Statue of King Charles I, at Charing Cross, the New Exchange, and Exeter
Change in the Strand, the Savoy once a famous Hospital, several Noblemens
Houses more like Princely Palaces (such as Montague, Berkley, Wallingford,
Southampton, and Northumberland House) the New Buildings raised from York,
Arundel, Worcester, Essex, Newport, and Clarendon-House. Those of Sohoe, which
alone might make a good large City, and many more too numerous to insist upon;
All these, together with so many fine Piazza's or Squares I have already
mentioned, are enough (if duly considered) to raise the Admiration of all
Strangers.

But, for a public Building of a late Erection, it is worth our while to step
out of the Way, and take a View of Chelsey-H^spital. Begun by Charles II.
continued by King James his Brother, and brought to perfection by our present
King and Queen; for the Refuge and Maintenance of poor and disabled Soldiers
that have faithfully served their King and Country. A stately Pile, which in
some respects outdo's, in others is out done by the famous Hotel des Invalides
at Paris.

As for the Government of London and Westminster, the City of London, with the
Liberties thereof, is governed in chief as to Civil Affairs, by a MAYOR, with
the Title of Lord prefixed, given to no Mayor in England but that of London, and
of late to the Mayor of York. In the Time of the Romans, he was called Prefect
of London; in the Saxons time, Port-greeve, and sometimes Provost of London;
and, after the Coming in of the Normans, Bailiff. 'Twas King Richard I, who in
the Year 1189 (being the first of his Reign) changed the Name of Bailiff into
that of Mayor, a French Word originally; which has continued ever since.

This great and mighty Magistrate is yearly chosen by the Citizens, upon
Michaelmas Day, the 29th of September. The Body out of which he is chosen are
the 26 Aldermen, all Persons of great Wealth and Wisdom, at least ought so to
be. Those that choose him are first the Livory-men, or Members of the several
Companies of Tradesmen within the City, and at last the Aldermen; which is done
in this manner. First, the Livery-Men do usually put up four Candidates, out of
which they choose two by the Plurality of Voices; and, out of these two, the
Court of Aldermen select whom they think fit. And, though they be free in their
Choice, yet commonly they have a regard for the Senior Alderman that has not
been Lord Mayor, and give him the Precedence.

The Mayor Elect being Proclaimed, is sworn first at Guildhall, and afterward
at Westminster. There he swears to maintain the Privileges of the People; and
here, to be True to the King.

The Installation-Day is the 29th of October, a Month after the Election. The
Solemnity of which Day upon his Account is so great, that no Magistrate in
Europe appears with so much state and grandeur as the Mayor of London upon his
Installation. First, he go's by water to Westminster in his Barge of state,
accompanied with the Aldermen in all their Formalities, with their Scarlet
Robes and Chains of gold hanging before their Breasts. The Twelve Companies
also, in their several Barges, ^et out with their Arms, Colors, and Screamers
on both sides, attend him in their furred Gowns. In his way he is saluted from
the Shore with the noise of great Guns; and, as he passes by Whitehall, the
King from thence viewing the Solemnity gives him and his Brethren a Mark of his
Respect. At last being landed at Westminster Bridge, the several Companies
march in order to their Hall, and after them the Mayor and Aldermen, with the
Sword and Mace before them, the Swordbearer with his Cap of Maintenance on his
head. At their Entrance into the Hall, the Hall is Entertained with the
harmonious Music of a Set of Hoboys, marching in order before them, and
playing all the Way. First they walk round the Hall, where they pay their
respects to each Court of Judicature; and from the Hall they proceed to the
Exchequer-Chamber, where the New Lord Mayor is Sworn by the Barons. This done,
they walk again in Procession round the Hall, to invite the several Judges of
each Court to Dinner at Guildhall. And, after this, the whole Procession
returns in the same manner by Water to Black-Friars. From whence the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen make their Cavalcade to Guildhall, all mounted upon Horses richly
Caparisoned; the Livery-Men marching before in good order. And now the
Artillery men make their best appearance, with their Buff-coats and
Head-pieces. But the most diverting Sight is that of the Pageants, here and
there in motion to divert the Spectators. At last a most splendid Dinner, to
which, besides the Judges, many of the great Lords and Ladies, the Privy
Counselors, the foreign Ambassadors, and oftentimes the King and Queen are
invited, concludes the Solemnity.

Such is the Magnificence of the Lord Mayor of London, though always a Citizen
and Tradesman, being a Member of one of the 12 Companies. Who, for his great
Dignity, is usually Knighted by the King, before the Year of his Mayoralty be
expired; unless he had received that Honor before, whilst he was an Alderman,
as of late has been ^shal.

His Authority reaches, not only all over this great City and part of the
Suburbs, (except some particular Places) but also on the Thames as far as the
Mouth of it, and Westward as far as Stanes-Bridge.

And so great is his Power, that he may cause any Person inhabiting within
London, or the Liberties thereof, to be Summoned to appear before him, upon the
Complaint of any Citizen; and, for Nonappearance, may grant his Warrant to
bring such Person before him. For he has Power to determine Differences between
Party and Party.

His Attendance, whilst he is a Mayor, is very considerable. For, besides his
proper Servants, first he has four principal Officers that wait on him as Lord
Mayor, who are reputed Esquires by their Places. And those are the
Sword Bearer, the Common Hunt, the Common Crier, and the Water-Bayliff; whose
Places are very advantageous, and purchased (when vacant) at a great rate from
the Lord Mayor for the time being. Besides them, there is the Coroner, 3
Sergeants Carvers, 3 Sergeants of the Chamber, 1 Sergeant of the Channel, 4
Yeomen of the Waterside, 1 Under Water-Bayliff, 2 Yeomen of the Chamber, 3
MealWeighers, 2 Yeomen of the Wood-Wharf, and several others. Most of which
have Servants allowed them, with Livories. Among which the Sword Bearer has a
1000 l. a Year allowed him for his Table in the Lord Mayor's House.

When he appears abroad on horseback (which is his usual Appearance) it is with
rich Caparison, and always in long Robes, sometimes of fine Scarlet-Cloth
richly furred, sometimes Purple, and sometimes Puke, with a black Velvet Hood
over his Robes, and a great Chain of Gold (with a rich Jewel to it) hanging
from his Neck downwards. Attended by several Officers walking before, and on
both sides of him.

He keeps an open Table all the Year to all Comers of any quality; and so well
furnished, that it is always fit to receive the greatest Subject of England, or
of any other Potentate. He has a Privilege to hunt, not only in Middlesex, but
also in Essex and Surrey, and for this purpose has a Kennel of Hounds always
maintained. On the King's Coronation-Day he claims to be the chief Butler, and
bears the King's Cup among the highest Nobles of the Kingdom which serve on
that Day in other Offices. And, upon the King's Death, he is said to be the
prime Person of England. Therefore, when King James I, was invited to come and
take the Crown of England, Robert Lee, then Mayor of London, subscribed in the
first place, before all the Officers of the Crown, and all the Nobility.

One Thing is observable, which happened not long since. I mean four Mayors the
City had in little more than half a Year; viz. Sir John Shorter, Sir John
Eyles, Sir John Chapman, and Sir Thomas Pilkington. For, upon the Death of the
first in September 1688, Sir John Eyles was made Lord Mayor; and in October
following, the Charter being restored, Sir John Chapman was chosen Lord Mayor.
Who dying in March following, Sir Thomas Pilkington was chosen in his room. In
whose Person the Chance is turned almost quite contrary. For, if he does
outlive the Time appointed for his Mayoralty by his late Re-election, instead
of being Mayor but one Year, according to the usual Course, his Mayoralty will
reach near two Years and a half.

Next to the Lord Mayor there are 26 Aldermen, A Recorder, Two Sheriffs, A
Chamberlain.


Besides the Undersheriffs, the Town Clerk (or Common Clerk,) and a
Remembrancer, these two last being both Esquires by their Places.

The 26 Aldermen preside over the 26 Wards of the City, a peculiar Alderman
being assigned to every Ward. Who has under him a certain Number of
Common-Council-Men, and one of them his Deputy; besides Constables, Scavengers,
Beadles, etc. Now the Aldermen who have been Lord Mayors, and the three eldest
Aldermen that have not yet arrived to that honorable estate, are by the
City-Charter Justices of Peace of the City. Upon the Death of an Alderman, the
Lord Mayor issues out his Precept to the Ward whereof he was Alderman, to choose
two substantial Men of the City, and return their Names to the Court of
Aldermen. Which being done, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen select one of
the two, such as they judge fittest for that Station.

The Recorder is usually a grave and learned Lawyer, well versed in the Laws
and Customs of the City, and in that Capacity is an Assistant to the Lord
Mayor. He takes his place in Councils, and in Court, before any Man that has
not been Mayor; and it is he that delivers the Sentences of the whole Court.

The two Sheriffs of this City are also Sheriffs of the County of Middlesex.
They are yearly chosen in the Guildhall on Midsummer-Day, by the Livery-Men of
the respective Companies, that is, by the Citizens from among themselves. A
high Privilege, considering the Importance of this Magistracy, especially in
their power of Impanelling Juries. Yet my Lord Mayor by his Prerogative may
drink to any Citizen, and nominate him to be one of the Sheriffs; In which Case
the Usage has been for the Commons to confirm such a Person, and to elect
another to serve with him. However, the new-chosen Sheriffs are not sworn till
Michaelmas Eve, and till then they do not enter upon their Office. If any of
the Parties chosen refuse to hold, he inours a Penalty of 450 l. unless he do
take his Oath, that he is not worth ten thousand pounds.

Each Sheriff has under him an Undersheriff, and six Clerks, viz. a Secondary,
a Clerk of the Papers, and four other Clerks. He has also a certain Number of
Sergeants, and every Sergeant a Yeoman. The Undersheriffs have also Clerks
under them.

The Chamberlain is an Officer of great Power in the City. For without him no
man can set up Shop, or follow his Trade without being sworn before him;
neither can one be bound an Apprentice to any Tradesman, but by his License. He
may Imprison any that disobey's his Summons, or anv Apprentice that misdemeans
himself, or else he may punish him in another manner.

But these are only general Notions of the chief Officers and Magistrates of
London; for the Particulars, I refer you to the Courts of Judicature, in my
Third Part.

In relation to Trade, which is the Life of this City, the Traders thereof are
divided into Companies, which are so many Bodies Politic, all enjoying large
Privileges granted by former Kings unto them.

Those Companies are in all about 70, twelve whereof are called the Chief
Companies. Viz. The Mercers, The Grocers, The Drapers, The Fishmongers, The
Goldsmiths, The Skinners, The Merchant Tailors The Haberdashers, The Salters,
The Iron-Mongers, The Vintners, The Cloth-Workers.


Each Company (or Mystery) has a Master yearly chosen from among themselves;
and other subordinate Governors, called Wardens, and Assistants. Such is the
Harmony of this Government, that these Companies do exactly correspond to the
general Government of the City by a Lord Mayor and Common Council, who are
selected out of these several Companies. For he that is chosen Lord Mayor must
be free of one of these 12 Companies; and, if he be of any other Company, he
presently removes to one of these. Which have got so great Credit and
Reputation in the World, that several Kings have honored some of them by
taking their Freedom thereof. The present King was lately pleased to accept of
the Freedom of the Company of Grocers; presented to Him in a golden Box in the
Name of the City by Mr. Box; upon which he was Knighted by His Majesty.

In short, such are the Privileges of the Citizens of London, that they are
Toll-free throughout England. And the Lord Mayor usually, at the Request of any
Citizen that trades in remote Parts, grants him his Warrant or Certificate.

They have also the Privilege to keep out all Artificers and Handicraftsmen
not free of the City. So that if a Freeman of London do employ any such to work
within the City or Liberties, he is liable to the Forfeiture of 5 l. a Day, and
an Action lies against him for the same. An Alien indeed may be employed six
Weeks, but no longer. And how severe soever this may seem to Foreiners, yet it
is grounded upon Equity. For were it not for that Privilege, here would be
such a Concourse of Foreiners, that it would prove (as it has by Experience)
the utter undoing of a great Number of poor Citizens and Freemen, whose
Livelihood depends upon their Handicrafts.

Another great Privilege they have, is their sending no less than four Members
to Parliament, which is twice the Number of other Cities and Borough-Towns in
England. And it is observable, that their Members do usually appear in their
Scarlet-Robes the first Day the Parliament sits, when all other Members (except
the Speaker of the House) appear in their usual Habit.

Thus the Lord Mayor of London, under the gracious Influences of the English
Monarchs, makes a Figure more like a Prince than a Subject. And the Citizens of
London, though under the same general Government as all the rest of the Kings
Subjects, yet live within themselves, blessed with so many Advantages, that I can
compare them no better than to the old Citizens of Rome under the best of their
Emperors.

And indeed the main Thing which has encouraged Trade here to that degree as to
render this Place so rich and flourishing, is the great Charters, Privileges,
and Immunities it is invested with, by the Munificence of several of the former
Kings. Whereby the Londoners are Empowered to choose their own Magistrates, to
do themselves Justice, to maintain their own Peace, and pursue all the good and
advantageous Ends of Trade, with the better Success and greater Security. In
order to which they keep within themselves many Courts and Councils, where they
make Laws for the better Government of the several Ranks and Orders of Men
among them. And, though these grand Privileges were judged to be forfeited by
the Court of Kings Bench upon the Quo Warranto brought in at the latter end of
Charles II his Reign, and a new Charter granted the City, but with several
Restrictions of great moment; yet that Judgment was Reversed upon their late
Application to the Parliament, and their ancient Charter Confirmed. So that
Things run now, as they did before that Judgment, in their proper Channel.

For Military Affairs, the City of London is a Lieutenancy of it self. So that
the Power of a Lord Lieutenant is in the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and other
principal Members of the City, for the Time being. Who, by a peculiar
Commission from His Majesty, are authorized to act as his Lieutenants in
London, for the ordering the City-Militia, with the same Power that the Lord
Lieutenants have in their respective Counties.

Now the City-Militia consists of 6 Regiments of Foot, making about 90000 men;
besides the Hamlets of the Tower 2 Regiments, and the Regiment of Southwark. To
which if we add the Militia of Westminster, consisting of 2 Regiments, called
Holborn and Westminster, each of 2000 men, we find in all eleven Regiments.
But, in case of Necessity the Auxiliaries are raised, consisting of
Apprentices, which make up six Regiments more; every Freeman that has two
Apprentices finding one for that purpose.

To supply the City Train-Bands and Auxiliary men with Commanders, there is a
Nursery of Soldiers, called the Artillery Company, of above 60 Years standing.
This Company consists of 600 choice men, commanded in chief by the King, and
under his Majesty by a Leader. Who exercises this Company every Tuesday
fortnight in the Artillery-Ground, a spacious Place near Moorfields, enclosed
for that purpose with a fair Brick-Wall. And the other Tuesday the Exercise is
performed by the several Members of the Company, who are there trained up to
command, most of them being Commanders of the Train-Bands. They have a
Court-Marshal, consisting of a President, Vice President, Colonel, and 24
Members of the Company. On the second Tuesday in February is their general
Rendezvous every Year, when they choose their Officers. Which, besides the
Leader, are two Lieutenants, 2 Ensigns, 2 Sergeants, a Provost Marshal, 3
Gentlemen of Arms, etc.

The Church Government is by the Bishop of London. The Parishes whereof, for
the most part provided with able and eminent Divines under the Title of Rector
or Vicar, are under his Jurisdiction.

And, for maintaining these Divines, with their Families, there is in most
Parishes a Parsonage, or Vicarage-House, with a yearly Allowance, besides the
Perquisites arising from Christenings, Marriages, and Burials. Which Allowance,
since the Reformation, falls much short of what it was in the time of Popery;
when, besides the Tithes of the Tradesmens Gains, the Mortuaries, Obits, etc.
the Priest (though in a state of Celibacy) had 3 shillings and 5 pence in the
pound of the yearly Rent of all the Houses and Shops in his Parish. Which
afterward was brought to 2 shillings, 9 pence in the pound, by an Act of
Parliament under the Reign of Henry VIII, and that confirmed by a subsequent
Act. But, since the Reformation, this being looked upon as too large an
Allowance, it has been so curtailed, that 'twill be hard to bring back that
golden Age. It Is true under the Reign of Charles II. a Regulation was made by
Act of Parliament, but it concerned only those Parishes, whose Churches had
been demolished by the dreadful Fire. And, according to the several Extents of
Parishes, the Parsons thereof, by virtue of that Act, have a certain yearly
Allowance, none under 100 Pounds, and none above 200; but most between one and
two hundred Pounds. The same to be raised, in lieu of Tithe, within the said
respective Parishes, by rating the Houses and Shops therein proportionably to
their respective Rents. As to those Parishes all over the City and Suburbs
where there is, besides the Parson, a Lecturer, he has his maintenance no
otherwise than by a voluntary Contribution from the Parishioners.

As for the City of Westminster, the Dean and Chapter are invested with all
mander of Jurisdiction, both Civil and Ecclesiastical; not only within the City
of Westminster, but also in other Places of their Jurisdiction, as the
Precincts of S. Martin le Grand within the Walls of London, and some Towns in
Essex. The Dean in particular has a Commission of Peace within the City and
Liberties of Westminster.

The principal Officer in it, called the High Steward of Westminster, is
usually one of the prime Nobility. Under whom there is a Deputy Steward, then
the Bailiff, and the two high Burgesses, these chosen every Year.

Within the Precincts of Westminster, but chiefly near the Court, the Nobility
and Gentry take up for the most part their Quarters. But the proper Station of
the Lawyers is in their Inns, between the City and the Court; and that of
Merchants and Seamen, in and about the East End of the City.

Thus you have a short Description of the famous City of London, the Metropolis
of England, the Seat of the British Empire, the Epitome and Glory of this
Kingdom. A City which for Greatness, Beauty, Conveniences, Plenty of
Provisions, Commerce, Riches, and good Government, is inferior to none beyond
Sea. It Is a Magazine of all sorts of Commodities, necessary or expedient for
the Use or Pleasure of Mankind. The great Rendez-vous of the Nobility, Gentry,
Courtiers, Divines, Lawyers, Physicians, Merchants, Seamen, of the best
Artificers, the most refined Wits, and the greatest Beauties of the Land.

For a constant Supply of Provisions, here are abundance of Markets, the best
furnished of any in Christendom; but especially Leaden-Hall-Market, near the
Royal Exchange in the City, the greatest Flesh-Market about the City, and a
great Magazine of Corn. So that there is scarce a great City in Europe, where
poor People, or such as love a frugal Life, may live cheaper, or the splendid
Liver, gallanter.

To get a Livelihood, and raise himself in the World, no Place like this; by
Mechanic or Liberal Arts, by Merchandising, Offices, Preferments, etc.

For Conveniences and Delight, here all is at hand; and scarce any Thing
wanting, that Money can purchase. In point of Society, here learned and
unlearned, high and low, rich and poor, good and bad, may fit themselves any
where.

And this I must needs say to the Praise of London, that, there is not a Place
in Europe of such a vast Confluence of all sorts of People, where Murders and
Outrages, so frequent in great and populous Cities beyond Sea, are so seldom
heard of. Which argues a great deal of Wisdom in the Magistrate, that so great
a Body should be kept in so good Order.

William the Conqueror, to prevent Disorders and Mischiefs in the Night,
commanded that in every Town and Village a Bell (called Curfew-Bell, a Corrupt
Word from the French Couvre-feu) should be rung every Night at 8 of the Clock,
and that all people should then put out their Fire and Candle. This continued
in his Reign, and that of his next Successor William Rufus. But Henry I.
revoked that Order; and Henry III. Anno 1253. commanded Watches to be kept in
Cities and Boroughs, for the Preservation of Peace and Quietness among his
Subjects.

Therefore there are in the respective Streets of London to this day convenient
Stations for the Watchmen; who are to examine all Persons walking in
unseasonable Hours, and to secure till next Day such as are either suspicious
or riotous. And then they bring them before a Justice of Peace, who deals with
them according to the Merit of the Cause. Thus Murders, Robberies, Felonies,
Fires, and other Evils, are oftentimes prevented; which could not be avoided in
so great and populous a Place, where a great many wicked People ly lurking for
Mischief. This Duty of Watching is commonly performed by Men hired for that
purpose, and paid for it by the Citizens, under the Command of a Constable,
assisted by the Eeadle of the Parish. In case of a public Riot, the King
usually sends a Party of his Gards to suppress it; and, if occasion requires,
part of the Militia is raised.

But, to draw to a Conclusion, if we cast our Eyes upon the vast Traffic and
Commerce, whereby this Place is become so flourishing, it will every where
afford matter of Admiration. The same does plainly appear by the Customs yearly
paid for all Merchandise Imported and Exported, by the great Wealth of many
Citizens, by the infinite Number of Shops both in the City and Suburbs for the
Retailing Trade, and lastly by the incredible Abundance of Apprentices which
are here brought up to all manner of Trades.

The Customs for this City alone (though very moderate, in comparison of most
other Places in Europe) did lately amount to near 400000 l. a Year. The Wealth
of the Citizens so vast, that some of 'em, for great Estates in Money, etc.
excel some Princes beyond Sea; and live accordingly in great state and plenty,
few so penuriously as most of the Dutch Merchants do. The Number of Shops both
in the City and Suburbs so great, and indeed so far beyond that of any forei^
City, that it is to Strangers a just Matter of Amazement. Proportionable to
which is That of the Apprentices, reckoned to be at least forty thousand.

Now this great Trade of the Londoners runs into three several Streams, 1.
among themselves, 2 in the Country, and 3 beyond Sea, of which in my second
Part.

Only I shall observe here, that the vast Trade of this Place has chiefly
occasioned that great Appearance in it of Pictures in the Air, a Thing taken
particular notice of at the first view by Strangers. I mean the Multitude of
Signs which hang before the Houses; many of them very rich and costly, and all
together yielding a fine Prospect.

But, on the other side, its frequent Dirt in Winter, and Dust in Summer, are
two such Nusances as take off very much from the Glory of it. And yet both of
them might with ease be Remedied, and will (I hope) in time. For, in point of
Cleanness, few Towns are better Seated than London is, standing upon an easy
Ascent from the River. And the Allowance for it from each Housekeeper is so
considerable, that one would think it enough to keep it cleaner than it is. But
the Truth is, there is a sort of Chemists, that can extract Gold out of Dirt.
And I conjecture the less Care has been taken to take off that Reproach from so
noble a City, because of the two great Conveniences it has to go free from the
Dirt from one End of it to the other, that is, by Land in Coaches, and by Water
in Boats. Besides that the principal Streets, and most of the New Buildings,
are paved a good convenient Breadth on each side with smooth hewn Stone, for
the benefit of Foot-Passengers. Which is a great Commodiousness, as well as an
Ornament.

I conclude, as to Loudon, with three notable Conveniences it has, not
elsewhere to be found; Viz. the New Lights, the Peny-Post, and the
Insurance-Office for Houses in case of Fire.

The New Lights is so ingenious and useful an Invention, that Mr. Edmund
Heming the Inventor deserves an immortal Praise for it. He brought it to light
about 6 Years ago, with a Patent from King Charles II, for the Enjoyment of the
Profits thereof. And such is the Reflection of these Lights, though at a good
distance from each other, that few of them serve to light a whole Street in the
Night, better than ten times the Number of Glass Lanthorns. For, by the regular
Position of one of them before the Front of every tenth House on each side of a
broad Street, there is such a mutual Reflection, that they all seem to be but
one great solar Light.

And so cheap is this Convenience, that for five Shillings down and five
Shillings a Year for five Years, to be paid at two Quarterly Payments, the
Inventor obliges himself to light the Front of ones House from Michaelmas to
Lady Day every Night from six to twelve, beginning the third Night after every
Full-Moon, and ending the sixth Night after every New Moon, which is in all 120
Nights.

The Peny-Post is such a Contrivance, that for one Penny a Letter, or Parcel not
exceeding one pound Weight, or ten pounds in value, is presently conveyed from
all Parts of the Town and Suburbs to the remotest Places thereof. And it has
been so far improved, since the first settling of it, as to reath ten miles
about London. He that sends pays the Penny; and, when the Letter or Parcel goes
beyond the Bounds of the Weekly Bills of Mortality, the Receiver pays another
Penny.

To carry on this useful Design, first there are about the Town four or five
hundred Houses to take in Letters and Parcels. And, to convey them according to
their Directions, there are about 100 messengers employed from Morning to
Night, to call every Hour at the said Houses, and take what Letters and Parcels
they find there. Who carry the same to their respective Offices, from whence
the Letters and Parcels are dispatched away according to their Directions. The
Offices are six in Number; Viz. The General Office. St. Paul's Office. The
Temple Office. Westminster Office. Soutwark Office. The Hermitage Office.


The General Office is in Star-Court in Cornhill, and has 3 Clerks belonging to
it; whereas the rest have but two Clerks each.

The whole Concern is managed in chief by three Persons, a Comptroller, an
Accomptant, and a Receiver. Every one of the Messengers, employed in the
bringing in and carrying out of Letters, gives 50 l. Security by Bond to the
Office for his Fidelity. And for this Contrivance the Public is indebted to
that ingenious Citizen of London, Mr. William Dockwrea, who settled it some
Years since, not without much trouble and cost. But the late King, when Duke of
York, sued him for the lame, as his Right, and carried it from the Inventor. So
that the Benefit of it is now inherent in the Crown.

The Insurance Office for Houses in case of Fire is also an Invention worth our
taking notice. To Insure, for example, 100 l. upon a Brickhouse, the Rates are
6 Shillings for one Year, 12 for two Years, 18 for three Years; and double for
a Timber-house. But, if any Insure for four Years, there is a Discount allowed
for paying down the Money, so that he pays but three Years and a Quarter; and
proportionably five for seven, seven for eleven Years Insurance. And, as often
as the House is Burnt, or Demolished by reason of Fire, within the Term
Insured, the Money Insured on the House is to be paid; but, if only Damaged,
then to be Repaired at the Charge of the Office. For the security of which
Payment, the Office has a Fund to the Value of 60000 l. in Ground-Rents of
Inheritance (which is above 2600 l. per annum) to answer Losses and Damages;
and settled on Twelve Gentlemen Trustees, by many of the most eminent Counsel
at Law.

This Ingenious and Useful Invention was first put into practice about 8 Years
since, and has deservedly met with good Encouragement, insomuch that there are
now above 7300 Houses Insured. The Office is kept on the Backside of the
Royal Exchange, and at the Rainbow Coffee-house by the Inner Temple Gate in
Fleetstreet.

Now, to put a present stop, as far as is possible, to any su^den Fire, there
are belonging to the Office a great many stout and lusty Servants in Livery
with Badges, dwelling in several parts of the City, and always to be ready on
all Occasions of sudden Fires. Who, in such Cases, do commonly expose
themselves to the utmost Hazards, and with great Dexterity labor to suppress
the Fire.

There is also another Office of Insuring of Houses, called the Friendly
Society, by a mutual Contribution agreed to by the Trustees; That every Member
of that Society shall pay yearly at the Office, before hand, only one shilling
four pence for every 100 l. secured upon Timber-houses by way of Praemium. By
this Office there are likewise a great many Houses secured.

To conclude, the Arms of the City of London are Argent, a Cross Gules, with
the Swerd of St. Paul.

CHAP. XIX.
Of OXFORD, and CAMBRIDGE.

FROM the great hurry of Trade in London I come now to the quiet Seats of the
Muses, the two famous Universities of the Land, Oxford and Cambridge.

Oxford.
OXFORD, or Oxon, the principal Place of Oxfordshire, which from hence takes
its Denomination, bears from London West-North-West, and is distant therefrom
47 miles, thus. From London to Vxbridge, 15; to Beaconfield, 7 more; thence to
Wickham, 5; to Stoken-Church, 5 more; from thence to Wheatly-Bridge, 9; and to
Oxford, 6 more.

It Is finely seated, for health, for pleasure* and plenty, at the Influx of the
Charwell into the Isis; where this divides it self into several Streams,
wherewith and the Charwell most part of the City is encompassed. But, for the
Convenience of its Inhabitants, here are several Bridges.

This is so ancient a City, as to fetch her Original from the Time of the
Britains. So large, as to contain 13 Parish-Churches, besides the Cathedral.
And so beautiful, that whether one looks on the compacted Uniformity of
private Houses, or the Magnificence of the public Structures, it must be
allowed to be a fair and goodly City.

Besides the Glory of being a most famous University, it is honored with a
Bishops See, founded by King Henry VIII. Anno 1541. and has been dignified
above 500 years successively with the Title of an Earldom in twenty of the
noble Family of the Veres. The first that enjoyed it was Aubrey de Vere,
created Earl of Oxford by Henry II. Anno 1155. In whose Line it continues to
this day in the person of the Right Honorable Aubrey de Vere, the present Earl
of Oxford.

As it is an University, this may be said o^ it in general, without immodesty,
and (...) hope without dislike or envy, That for the stateliness of the Schools
and public Library, the bravery and beauty of particular Coledges all built of
fair and polished Stone the liberal Indowments of those Houses and notable
Encouragements of Industr^ and Learning in the Salary of the Professo^ in most
Arts and Sciences, it is not to (...) parallelled in the Christian World; and
for the Number of Students, and the well ordering of them by good Laws and
Ordinances, not to be equalled by any but her Sister Cambidge.

That Oxford has been for many Ages a Place of public Studies, is a Thing past
all doubt. But it is true withal, that there has been a Time of Decay; when
this City sharing with the rest of the Land in those common Calamities brought
by the Saxons and Danes, the Muses were dispersed, and shifted for themselves.
Alfred, the learned Saron King of England, was he that recalled them; who,
having entirely subjected the irksom Danes to his Government, made it his
business to restore this University, and repair the Ruins thereof. And, the
better to invite Students to Oxford, he sent thither his Son Ethelward, which
dr^^^ the young Nobles from all Parts to Oxford. This came to pass about the
latter end of the ninth Century. Then Oxford began to flourish again, and by
degrees to grow to what it is.

But, as now in Leyden and many other foreign Universities, so anciently in
Oxford the Students lived in Citizens Houses, having only Meeting Places to
hear Lectures and Disputations, and that without any distinction of Habit.
After that, there were diverse Houses (now called Halls) for Students only to
live together in Society, as now the Inns of Court and of Chancery at London.
Amongst which some afterward Endowed by the bounty of diverse Patrons of
Learning; who thought best to settle for ever plentitiful Revenues in Lands and
Houses, in order to maintain such Students as by merit and worth should from
time to time be chosen, and to settle large Salaries for Professors to inftruct
'em, and for a Head to govern them, according to certain Statutes and
Ordinances made by the said Patrons or Founders. And these are the Colleges,
whereof the first thus Endowed in Europe were University, Baliol, and Merton
Colleges.

In short, there are in Oxford 18 of such Endowed Colleges, and 7 Halls. In
which Halls the Students live with the same Discipline as those in the
Colleges, but upon their own Means, except certain Exhibitions (or annual
Pensions) annexed to one or two of them. The Names of the Colleges, and their
Founders, together with the Time of their Foundation, you have in the following
Table.

Colleges, Founded by, Anno University King Alfred. 872. Baliol Jo. Bal^ol
Knight and Deb. his Wife. 1263. Merton Walter de Merton, Clerk. 1267. Exeter

1555 Jesus Dr. Hugh Price. 1571 ^adham Nich. Wadham, and Dor. his Wife. 1612
^embroke. Tho. Tisdale Esquire, and King Whitwich Clerk. 1624

The Seven Halls are Magdalen Hall. Edmund Hall. Albon Hall. Heart Hall. S. Mary
Hall. Gloucester Hall. And New Inn.


Now, to make a particular Description of those stately Colleges, their Halls,
Chapels, and Libraries, their excellent Accommodation for young Noblemen and
Gentlemen, their ^arge Revenues, great Salaries for public Professors, and
Allowances for poor Scholars, etc. would require another Volume. But this I
must say of the Bodlean Library, a notable lightsom Fabric, that for Number of
choice Books, rare Manuscripts, diversity of Languages, liberty of studying,
and facility of finding any Book, it scarce falls short of the famous Vatican.
The New Theater, built for Scholastic Exercises by Dr. Sheldon, the late most
Reverend Archbishop of Canterbury, is so curious a Piece of Architecture, that
it were a Trespass not to take notice of it. And the public Physic Garden,
surrounded with stately Stone-Walls, and abounding with Variety of choice
Plants, is so delightful a Place, that I could not do less than mention it.

But the lately erected Musaeum, finished in the Year 1683, deserves a brief
Account. It Is a large and stately Pile of squared Stone, built at the Charge of
the University, and designed not only to advance the Studies of true and real
Philosophy, but also to conduce to the Uses of Life, and the Improvement of
Physic. This Building borders upon the West End of the Theater, having a
stately Portal on that side, sustained by Pillars of the Corinthian Order. But
the Front of it is to the Street Northward. It consists of ten Rooms, whereof
the three principal and largest are public, being in length about 56 foot, and
in breadth 25. The uppermost is properly the Musaeum Ashmoleanum, so called
from Elias Ashmole Esquire, who enriched it with a noble Collection of
Curiosities. To which have been added since several Hieroglyphics, and other
Egyptian Antiquities by Dr. Robert Huntington; an entire Mummy, by Mr. Aaron
Goodyear; a large Cabinet of Natural Rarities, by Martin Lister, Dr. of
Physic; besides several Roman Antiquities, as Altars, Medals, Lamps, etc.
found here in England. So that in a few Years this is like to be one of the
most famous Repositories in Europe. The middle Room is the School of Natural
History, where the Professor of Chemistry reads 3 times a Week, on Mundays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays, during the time of the Chemical Course, which
continues a whole Month. His Business is to explain the natures, qualities, and
virtues, etc. of all natural Bodies, relating to and made use of in Chemical
Preparations. The lower Room is the Laboratory, furnished with all sorts of
Furnaces, and other Materials, in order to Chemical Practice. Near unto which
is the Store-Room for Chemical Preparations, and another fitted for a Chemical
Library.

Now every College has within its own Walls Lectures and Disputations in all
Liberal Arts; and some of them public Lectures for all Comers, with large
Salaries for the Readers. Insomuch that they seem to be so many Universities.

The whole Number of Students in Oxford, that live upon the Revenues of the
Colleges, is about One thousand; and of other Students, about twice as many.
Besides Stewards, Manciples, Butlers, Cooks, Porters, Gardeners, etc.

He that intends to take any Degree is to take his Diet and Lodging, and have a
Tutor constantly, in some College or Hall; where he must be subject to all
Statutes, and to the Head of the House. He must be likewise subject to the
chief Magistrate of the University, and the public Statutes thereof. He is
constantly to wear a black Cap and Gown, only the Sons of Noblemen are herein
indulged. By Night all Scholars are to be shut up in their several Houses. And,
before they can attain to any Degree, they must perform all Exercises.

The Degrees taken in the University are in Arts properly but two, viz. of
Batchelour and Master. To take the Degree of Bachelor is required 4 Years, and
3 Years more for to be Master of Arts.

In the three Professions of Divinity, Law, and Physic, there is a higher
Degree, that of Doctor, which requires a great deal more time. For, to attain
unto it, a Master of Arts must be first capable of being a Bachelor in any of
those Professions; which in Divinity requires 7 Years more, in Law or Physic
most commonly but 3. And, after that, before the Degree of Doctor can be had, 4
Years more is requisite.

The Exercises required for taking these Degrees are many, and difficult
enough; yet not such but that they may be performed in less time by any Man of
good Abilities. But so much Time is required, first because Judgment and
Discretion comes with Time and Years; and perhaps, that those of slower Parts
might by Time and Industry make themselves capable of that Honor, as well as
those of quicker Abilities.

The Time of completing the Degree of Bachelor of Arts is in Lent, at which
time there commonly proceed about 200 Batchelors. And that of completing the
Degree of Master of Arts, or of Doctor in any of the three Professions, is
always the Monday after the sixth of July, when there proceed Masters or
Doctors yearly about 150. Then is the Act, that is the Time, not only for
public Exercises, but also for Feastings and Comedies, unless some
extraordinary Occasion do hinder it. Which draw's a mighty Concourse of
Strangers from all Parts to their Friends and Relations then completing their
Degrees. Whereby, and by the set Fees, it usually costs a Doctor about 100 l.
sterling, and a Master of Arts 20 or 30 pounds.

But, besides these famous Societies in the Colleges and Halls of this
University, there is another lately established, by the Name of the
Philosophical Society, for the Improvement of real and experimental Philosophy.
This Society (being much of the same nature as the Royal Society at London,
with whom they have settled a Correspondency) meets every Tuesday in the
Afternoon, by the permission and favor of the Government, in the Natural
History-School.

Lastly, as this City consists of two sorts of Inhabitants, Students and
Citizens, living one among another, so they are wholly separate for Government
and Manners.

The chief Magistrate of the University is called the Chancellor, who is
usually One of the prime Nobility, and nearest in favor with the King; Elected
by the Students themselves in Convocation, to continue durante Vita. Whose
Office is to take care of the Government of the whole University, to maintain
the Liberties and Privileges thereof, to call Assemblies to hear and determine
Controversies, to call Courts, punish Delinquents, etc.

The next is the Vice Chancellor, who is yearly nominated by the Chancellor,
and is commonly the Head of some College. His Duty is, in the Chancellor's
absence, to do whatever almost the Chancellor might do if he were present. He
keeps Judicial Courts, wholly ruled by the Civil Law, which all Members of the
University are subject to. And, by Charter of Henry IV, it is left to his
Choice, whether any Member in the University there inhabiting, accused for
Felony or High Treason, shall be tried by the Laws of the Land, or by the Laws
and Customs of the University. Though now, where Life or Limb is concerned, the
Criminal is left to be tried by the Laws of the Land. But in all Suits for
Debts, Accounts, Contracts, Injuries, etc. betwixt the Students, he is the
proper Judge; and has Power to determine such Causes, to Imprison, to give
corporal Punishment, to excommunicate, to suspend, and to banish.

It Is the Vice-Chancellor's Business to see, that Sermons, Lectures,
Disputations, and other Exercises, be performed; that lewd people, Heretics,
etc. be expelled the University, and the Converse with Students; that the
Proctors, and other Officers of the University, duly perform their Duty; that
Courts be duly called, and Lawsuits determined without delay. In a word, that
whatever is for the Honor and Benefit of the University, or may conduce to the
Advancement of good Literature, may be carefully obtained.

Next to the Vice Chancellor are the two Proctors, yearly chosen by turns out
of the several Colleges. These are to assist in the Government of the
University; more particularly in the business of Scholastic Exercises, and
taking Degrees, in searching after and punishing all Violaters of Statutes or
Privileges of the University, all Night-Walkers, etc. They have also the
Oversight of Weights and Measures, that Students may not be wronged.

Next in order is the Public Orator. Whose Charge is to write Letters,
according to the Orders of the Convocation or Congregation; and, at the
Reception of any Prince or great Person that comes to see the University, to
make proper Harangues, etc.

Then there is the Custos Archivorum, or Keeper of Records. Whose Duty is to
collect and keep the Charters, Privileges, and Records that concern the
University; to be always ready to produce them before the chief Officers; and
to plead the Rights and Privileges of the University.

Lastly, there is a Register of the Univerfity; whose Office is to register all
Transactions in Convocations, Congregations, Delegacies, etc.

Besides the foresaid Officers, there are certain public Servants, the chief
whereof are the six Beadles, and the Verger. Three of the first are called
Squire Beadles, who carry large Maces of Silver gilt; and the other three,
Yeomen Beadles, whose Maces are of Silver but ungilt. Their Office is always to
wait on the Vice Chancellor in public, doing what belongs to his Place; and,
at his Command, to seize any Delinquent, and carry him to Prison; to summon,
and publish the Calling of Courts or Convocations, to conduct Preachers to
Church, and Lecturers to School, etc. But, upon Solemnities, the Verger appears
with a Silver Rod in his hand; and, walking with the other six before the
Vice Chancellor, is to observe his Commands, and to wait on Grand Compounders,
etc.

I have already mentioned several great Privileges, granted by former Kings to
this University. That of sending two Burgesses to Parliament they hold from
King James I. Another, that no Victuals be taken by the King's Purveyors within
5 miles of Oxford, unless the King himself comes thither, is of a much more
ancient Date.

But one of the most considerable is That granted by Charter of King Edward
III, whereby the Mayor of Oxford is to obey the Orders of the Vice Chancellor,
and be in subjection to him. Accordingly the Mayor, with the chief Burgesses in
Oxford, and the High Sheriff of Oxfordshire besides, every Year in a solemn
manner take an Oath, given by the Vice Chancellor, to observe and conserve the
Rights, Privileges, and Liberties of the University of Oxford. And every Year
on the tenth of February, being the Day of S. Scholastica, a certain Number of
the principal Burgesses, publicly and solemnly do pay to each College a Penny,
in token of their Submission to the Orders and Rights of the University.

Thus you have a short Description of Oxford, as a City and an University. My
next Business is the Description of Cambridge.

Cambridge.
CAMBRIDGE, the chief Town of Cambridgeshire, and that from whence the Country
is denominated, bears from London North by East, and is distant therefrom 44
miles, thus. From London to Waltham 12; to Ware, 8 more; thence to Puckeridge,
5; to Barkway, 7; and to Cambridge, 12 more.

It Is seated at the Confluence of two Rivers, the Came and the Grant; which
running from thence Northward in one Channel empty themselves in the Ouse, 3
miles above Ely. By these Rivers it is separated into two (but unequal) Parts,
but they have Communication by a Bridge.

It is a Place of a large Extent, numbering 14 Parishes. And, according to
Doctor Fuller's Observation in his Worthies of England, it is a Town within an
University, whereas Oxford is an University within a Town. For in Cambridge the
Colleges are not so surrounded with Streets as in Oxford, but for the
generality seated in the Skirts of the Town, which afford them the better and
more delightful Walks and Gardens about them.

There are in Oxford (as I said before) 18 Endowed Colleges, and 7 Halls. In
Cambridge there is but 12 Colleges, and 4 Halls. It Is true they are all
Endowed, and generally so large that the Number of Students is commonly little
different from that of Oxford. The Names of them, and of their Founders,
together with the Time of their Foundation, you have in the following Table.

Colled. and Halls, Founded by Anno. S. Peter's College Hugh de Balsham Bishop
of Ely. 1284 Clare-Hall Rich. Badow Chanc. of the University. 1326
Pembroke-Hall Mary S. Paul. 1343 Gonvile and Cajus Edmund de Gonvile and Cajus.
1348 Trinity-Had Will. Bateman, Bishop of Norwich. 1350 Corpus Christi H. of
Monmouth, D. of Lancaster. 1351 King's College King Henry VI. 1441 Queen's
College Margaret, Wife to King Henry VI. 1448 Catharine Hall Robert Wood, Lord
Chancellor of the University. 1475 Jesus College John Alcock, Chanc. of
England. 1496 Christ's Colled. S. John's Coll. Margaret Countess of Richmond.
1505 Christ's Colled. S. John's Coll. Margaret Countess of Richmond. 1508
Magdalen Coll. Tho. Audley, Chanc. of England. 1519 Trinity College King Henry
VIII. 1546 Emanuel College Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer.
1582 Sidney and Sussex Francis Sidney, Chancellor of Sussex. 1598

The Degrees at Cambridge are usually taken as at Oxford, except in Law and
Physic. For at Cambridge six Years after one has taken the Degree of Master of
Art, one may take the Degree of Bachelor; and, after five Years more, that of
Doctor.

The Batchelors of Arts complete their Degree in Lent, beginning at
Ash Wednesday. And the first Tuesday of July is always Dies Comitiorum, there
called the Commencement, wherein the Masters of Arts and the Doctors of all
Faculties complete their Degrees respectively.

Here is, as in Oxford, a Chancellor, a Vice Chancellor, two Prectors, and a
Register. But the Chancellor is not so durante Vita; for he may be elected
every three years, or continue in the same Office durante tacito Consensu
Senatus Cantabr.

He has under him a Commissary, who holds a Court of Record of Civil Causes for
all privileged Persons and Scholars under the Degree of Master of Arts; where
all Causes are tried and determined by the Civil and Statute Law, and by the
Customs of the University.

The Vice Chancellor is a high Officer, chosen every Year on the 3d of Nov. by
the Senate out of two Persons nominated by the Heads of the several Colleges
and Halls.

Together with the two Proctors, chosen as at Oxford, there are two Taxers
chosen; who with the Proctors look to the Weights and Measures, as Clerks of
the Market.

Here are also three Esquire-Beadles, but only one Yeoman-Beadle.

The Mayor of the Town is like that of Oxford, subject to the University, and
takes a solemn Oath, at the Entrance into his Office, to observe and conserve
the Privileges, Liberties, and Customs thereof. And on Friday before St. Simon
and Jude he brings with him to St. Mary's Church, allotted for the Assembly of
the whole University, two Aldermen, four Burgesses, and two of every Parish, to
take their Oaths before the Vice Chancellor, for the due search of Vagabonds,
and suspected Persons, etc. At the same time are sworn 14 Persons for the
University, and 14 for the Town, to look to the Cleansing and Paving of the
Streets.

The University has also a Court Leet, held twice every Year, wherein are
presented all Nusances, etc.

What remains is the Question about the Antiquity of Cambridge as a Place of
Learning, in opposition to Oxford. To me it appears to be in that respect of an
older date than Oxford. For Cambridge, in the time of the Romans, (among whom
it was known by the Name of Camboritum, or, as some Copies have it,
Camboricum,) was a Roman Colony, mentioned in the best Copies among the 28
Cities of Britain. And the Roman Colonies had their Schools of Learning,
wherein the several Professors of Arts and Sciences did instruct both the Roman
and British Youth. In the Bull of Pope Honorius the first, bearing date Febr.
20. 624, mention is made of Privileges granted to the University of Cambridge.
The Bull says by Eleutherius, the 12th Bishop of Rome, who lived about the
latter end of the second Century, but King Arthur's Diploma says by Lucius, a
British King, the first Christian King in Europe, and Contemporary with the
said Eleutherius. Which Diploma says, that King Lucius was converted by the
preaching of the Doctors of Cambridge, for which reason he gave Privileges to
that University, which were confirmed by King Arthur. Whether the Diploma be
counterfeit or not, or whether the aforesaid Privileges were granted by King
Lucius or Pope Eleutherius, is a Question by it self. Certain is, that both the
Diploma and the Bull agree, in point of Time. So that here is Proof enough, to
make it at least probable, that in the time of King Lucius and Pope Eleutherius
there might be a sufficient Number of learned Men in Cambridge to have
instructed King Lucius in the Christian Faith; and that Eluanus and Medwinus,
who were sent by that King to Rome for his fuller Satisfaction in that point,
might be of that Number.

Upon these Grounds it must be granted, that Cambridge is a Place long since
dedicated unto Learning; and I doubt much whether Oxford (as great a Respect as
I have for it) can pretend to so great an Antiquity.

But Dr. Heylin, an Oxonian, alleges a notable Reason for the Precedence of
Oxford before Cambridge; Viz. the Resolution of the Commons in the first
Parliament held under King James I. For (says he) when the Clerk of that House
had put the Name of Cambridge before Oxford, they taking disdainfully that
Hysteron-Proteron commanded the Antiquities of both Universities to be
searched, and after search made gave place to Oxford.

To clear this Point, we must take notice, that both Oxford and Cambridge,
since their first Foundation, lay for several Ages forlorn and discontinued,
during the long Wars of the Saxons and Danes in this Island. Till Oxford had
the happiness to be first restored by King Alfred, toward the latter end of
the Ninth Century. Which from that time grew into such esteem, as to be counted
one of the four principal Universities of Europe, the other three being Paris
in France, Bononia (now Bologna) in Italy, and Salamanca in Spain. Whereas
Cambridge did not begin to flourish again, till the Reign of Henry I, for his
Learning surnamed Beau-Clerc, that is in the beginning of the Twelfth Century.
So that in point of Restoration, it is plain that Oxford has got the start of
Cambridge.

But let us leave this Speculation of Cambridge as an Academy, and look upon it
as a Title of Honor. In this Point we shall find Cambridge to have the
Preeminency. For it has been Dignified, not only with the Title of an Earldom
in several eminent Persons, but also with the Title of a Dukedom, in four Sons
of the late King James, when Duke of York. Three of them by the first Duchess,
Charles, James, and Edgar, who all died very young; and the fourth, by the last
Duchess Charles by Name, the short Hopes of the Popish Faction. Who, being
born Nov. 7. 1677. died Dec. 12. following, and so lived but five Weeks.

Thus I have done with OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE, those two great Fountains of
Learning, both seated at almost an equal Distance from London, the one West,
and the other North. From whence are yearly sent forth a great Number of
Divines, Civilians, Physicians, etc. to serve all Parts of this Kingdom.

For a constant Supply whereof there are several Colleges and famous Schools
in England; the principal Winchester, Eaton, Westminster, St. Paul's,
Merchant-Taylors, and Charter House, all richly Endowed, to maintain Masters,
Ushers, and a certain Number of Scholars. So that a Child, once admitted into
any of these Schools, may by his Capacity be preferred to be a Scholar, or
Fellow in some College of one of these Universities. Where having a good
Allowance, he will want little or no help from his Parents all his Lifetime
after.

CHAP. I.
Of the Inhabitants of ENGLAND. And first of their Complexion, Temper, Genius,
Language; with an Account of the most famous Men of this Nation, either for
Soldiery or Learning.

THAT the Britains were the ancient Inhabitants of England, is a Thing agreed
by all. But, whether they ^ere the Aborigines, that is, the very first
Inabitants of all, it may be made a Question, and such as can scarce be solved.
Therefore that wise Roman Historian, Tacitus, puts it off with an Ignoramus;
Qui Mortales (says he) Initio coluerint, parum compertum est. As to the
Original of the Britains themselves, Caesar proves them to be derived from the
Gauls, by their Agreeableness in their Making, Speech, Manners, Laws, and
Customs. A rude and illiterate Nation, whose Learning (such as it was) was all
locked up in the breasts of the Druids, their Priests; who communicated what
they knew to none but those of their own Order, and by that means kept the
People (much like the Papists of our Days) in continual Ignorance of their
sacred Mysteries.

The Romans began the Conquest of this People under the Emperor Claudius, about
the middle of the first Century, and completed it in the time of Domitian, as
far at least as the Frythes of Edinburgh and Dunbarton in Scotland; unwilling
to venture further, where there was nothing to be got but blows, cold, and
hunger. For, as to Julius Caesar, he rather discovered than conquered England;
and his three next Successors, Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula, made no
Attempt upon it. So that we cannot properly reckon the Conquest of England, but
from the Empire o^ Claudius, Uncle to Caligula. Thus the Britains continued
subject to the Romans about 400 Years after Christ, till the Reign of Honorius:
When Italy being invaded by the Goths, the Romans abandoned Britain, to defend
their own Country.

After the Romans were departed, under whose Protection and easy Government the
Britains lived comfortably, they soon became a Prey to the Picts and Saxons;
but chiefly t^ the Saxons who never left off teazing of the Britains, till
these quitted the Stage, and retired beyond the Severn into Wales. Thus England
came to be wholly possessed by a new Nation, that is, an aggregate Body of many
People amongst the Germans, who came hither to try their fortune.

After the Saxons came the Danes, the next considerable, and the most cruel
Actors on the Stage of England. Who, in the time of Egbert the Saxon Monarch,
(that is, in the Ninth Century) first invaded this Country; and so exercised
the patience of his Posterity, till at last they overpowred them, and got the
Kingdom to themselves. But then the Saxons and Danes lived together, mixed in
Marriages and Alliance, and so made one Nation consisting of Saxons and Danes.

At last, in the eleventh Century, the Normans (a Northern People of France)
came in with their Duke William. Who in one Battle got his pretended Right to
the Crown of England, and from a single Victory the Title of Conqueror. Now
the Normans mixing (as they did) with the Body of this Nation, we may say, that
the English Blood at this day is a Mixture chiefly of Saxon, Dane, and Norman,
not without a Tincture of British and Romish Blood.

And, as the Country is temperate and moist, so the English have naturally the
advantage of (...) clear Complexion; not Sindged as in hot Climates, nor
Weather-beaten as in cold Regions. The generality, of a comely Stature,
graceful Countenance, well-featured, grayyed, and brown-haired. But for Talness
and Strength the Western People exceed all the ^est.

The Women generally more handsome than in other Places, and without
Sophistications sufficiently endowed with natural beauties. In an absolute
Woman, say the Italians, are required the Parts of a Dutch-Woman from the Waste
downwards; of a French-Woman, from the Waste up to the Shoulders; and over them
an English Pace. Therefore an English-Woman makes one of the six Things wherein
England excels, comprehended in this Latin Verse, Anglia, Mons, Pons, Fons,
Ecclesia, Foemina, Lana.

That is to say, For Mountains, Bridges, Rivers, Churches fair, Women, and
Wool, England is past Compare.

In short, there is no Country in Europe where Youth is generally so charming,
Men so proper and well proportioned, and Women so beautiful.

The Truth is, this Happiness is not only to be attributed to the Clemency of
the Air. Their easy Life unde^^^e best of Governments, which saves them from
the Drudgery and Hardship of other Nations, has a great hand in it. And the
Experience of a Neighboring People shows us sufficiently, there is nothing
more destructive of good Complexion than that Monster of Slavery. A fit Subject
therefore for that Sex, which is so tender of Beauty, to chew upon.

The English Temper is naturally suitable to their Climate. They are neither so
fiery a^ the French, nor so cold as the Northern People; better tempered for
Counsel than the first, for Execution than the last. A happy temper besides for
all sorts of Learning. The generality of them reserved and wary, not apt to
communicate but with their best and serious Acquaintances. And as their
Friendship is not easily gained, so when once got it is not easily lost.

The Mischief is, that by their different Interests both in Civil Matters and
Points of Religion, they are apt to be divided into Factions, which takes off
very much from their Happiness. After so great a Deliverance as they were
lately blessed with, who would have thought that there should be now a Party,
(tho inconsiderable) which repineth at it? And that a Protestant Party; who,
like the Israelites, have a lingering Mind after the Onions of Egypt. Brought
as they are out of Captivity by the wounderful hand of Providence into a happy
state of Liberty, they grumble, and weary of their happiness seem willing to
exchange their Moses for a Pharaoh. Were none but they concerned in the Change,
it is pity but they should have it, and be crushed into Common Sense. They put
me in mind of those silly Women in Moscovy, (which according to Olearius) fancy
their Husbands love them best that whip 'em most.

For Courage, I cannot but say this for the English, That Death, the King of
Terrors, is ^o where so affronted as it is amongst them. Whether I look upon
those that die privately in their Beds, or publicly upon a Scaffold or Gibet,
I see so much Unconcernedness, that it is a wonder how a Nation that lives in so
much case should value their Lives so little. In point of Fighting, it is true
they are not altogether so hasty as the French to fight out a single Quar^el.
But it is not so much for want of Courage, as out of respect to the Laws, which
are severe upon those that break the Peace.

For, upon a public Account, when Men fight with Authority, no Nation shows
more forwardness. As they are a free People, their Spirits are accordingly
averse from Slavery, and as greedy of Glory. Their Fore fathers Exploits, which
by oral Tradition, and reading of Histories, they are generally pretty well
acquainted with, adds much to their Courage, But especially the Notion of their
Conquest of France is so universally spread all over the Nation, and their
Antipathy against the French so great and universal, that one may reasonably
expect a good Success from their first Attempt upon France, when Opportunity
shall serve. For desperate Attempts no Nation like the English, either by Sea
or Land. If they be bent upon Fighting, they go to it undaunted, without
telling the Number, or valuing the Strength of their Enemies. With this bold
and undaunted Courage, not common with other Nations, they have sometimes
outdone the very Romans themselves; and for this I appeal particularly to the
History of France, where with a hand-full of Men they have routed and defeated
the bravest Armies. It Is true they were at last expelled from thence, bu^ their
Expulsion was not so much the Fruit o^ the French Valor, as the Effect of our
Divisions. So redoubted they were afterward i^ France, that in the Wars
between Charles VIII and the Duke of Bretagne, the Duke, to strik^ a Terror
amongst the French, apparelled 150^ of his own Subjects in the Arms and Cross
(...) England. But it proved as the Ass, when (...) had on the Lions Skin.

For a further Proof of the English Valor, I might recount their Victories of
old over the Irish, Scots, Cypriots, and Turks. And Spain it self has
sufficiently experienced both by Sea and Land the English Valor, to its cost;
but by Sea especially. Witness the Battle Anno 1588. where Q. Elizabeth, with a
few Ships, vanquished the Spanish Fleet, which for the greatness of it was
called Invincible. Sir Francis Drake, the Year before that, had with four Ships
only took from the Spaniard one Million and 189200 Ducats in one Voyage. And
afterward with 25 Ships he awed the Ocean, sacked S. Jago, S. Dominico, and
Carthagena; carrying away with him, besides Treasure, 240 Pieces of Ordnance.
Sr. Richard Greenvile, Captain of one of the Queens Ships called the Revenge,
with 180 Soldiers (whereof 90 were disabled with Sickness) maintained a
Sea Fight for 24 hours against an incredible Number of the Spanish Galleons,
sunk four of the greatest, and killed several thousands of their Men. Till at
last, her Powder being spent to the last Barrel, she yielded upon honorable
Terms, yet was never brought into Spain. To this I shall add the famous
Adventure of John Oxenham an Englishman, one of the Followers of Sr. Francis
Drake, in the West Indies. Where being landed in a small Barque, with 70 of his
Companions, a little above Nombre de Dios in the Isthmus of Panama, he drew his
Barque on Land, covered it with Boughs, and marched over the Land with his
Company, guided by Negroes, till he came to a River. There he cut down Wood, to
make him a Pinnace; wherewith he entered the South Sea, and went to the Isle of
Pearls. About which Island in few days he surprised two Spanish Ships, with an
incredible Treasure of Gold and Silver, and so returned in safety to the Land.
An Adventure not to be forgotten, and recorded by Spanish Writers with much
admiration; so bold was the Attempt, so strange the Success, and so prodigious
the Booty.

These Things I thought fit to record, now this is a Time for Action. We have a
great Enemy to encounter with, the Irish, but only great by their Numbers. It Is
but fighting with Ciphers. But with the French there is both Laurels and Booty
to be got. And, if the English Soldiery will but seriously reflect how much
this Nation has been in the late Reigns abused and undermined by Them, whose
Masters they were formerly, I doubt not but with Gods Blessing and their
natural Courage, under the Conduct of a magnanimous King and of a great
General, they will right themselves, and be a glorious Instrument for the
settling the Peace of Europe upon a sure and lasting Foundation.

The Character of Pride which Scaliger gives the English Nation, Scaliger de Re
Poetica, Lib. 3. Cap. 16.
when he calls them Inflatos and Contemptores, is a Character common to most
Nations, but to none so well adapted as to his own. For the French, like the
Romans of old, look upon most other Nations as barbarous, and count themselves
the most accomplished. I confess they have great many good Qualifications, but
this presumptuous Conceit spoils all. And, all Things being considered, if the
English have a little Pride, it is perhaps the best grounded of any Nation.

Cruelty and Barbarity, which the same Author charges 'em with, when he calls
them Inhospitales, Immanes, is a mere Phantasm of his own. It Is true, the
English are not so fawning as the French upon Strangers, because they can make
better shift without them; but I hope they don't want common Civility. They
have indeed some thing of a natural Antipathy against the French, as there is
to this day betwixt the French and the Spaniards. Yet, when the French
Protestants fled to them for Refuge in the late Persecution, the strength of
their Charity overcame their Nature. They laid aside their inbred Prejudices,
and forthwith made it their business to relieve them as Brethren, who suffered
for their Religion. How moderate they have been toward the plotting Papists, I
leave the World to judge. Had the Huguenots of France plotted against the
Government there, as the Papists have done here ever since the Reformation,
what do you think could have expiated their Crime? Nothing but a quick and
general Massacre, such as they suffered under Charles IX, without the least
Provocation. The late Experience tells us, what Spirit of Cruelty has possessed
the French; when, upon the Kings Protestant Subjects utmost Submission to him
in Civil Matters, and his most solemn and sacred Engagements to preserve their
Liberties, this very Prince (whom they had lifted upon the Throne, with the
expense of their Blood) contrary to Equity and the Laws of the Land, to his
Oaths and Promises, and to the Rules of Gratitude and Humanity, let them loose
to the Cruelty of his Apostolic Dragoons; by whom they were crushed,
persecuted, and used beyond the Barbarity of the very Heathens themselves. But
in England, as obnoxious as the Catholics are to the Government, ^^d liable to
the lash of the Law, still they are tole ^^ted, and connived at, almost beyond
measure. Were Scaliger alive, what could he say to all this? How could he
answer the late cruel Burnings and Devastations the French made in Germany,
contrary to the Rules of War, and the very Practice of the most barbarous
Nations? And what could he say to their genteel Way of Poisoning, wherein they
have been of late so dexterous, and the English so dull?

But, to clear further the English from that foul Imputation of Cruelty and
Barbarity, if we look upon their Plantations abroad, who more courteous and
gentle than this Nation? If we inspect their Proceedings against Malefactors,
no Nation in the World shows so much humanity, or proceeds with more equity.
The barbarous Use of Racks, apt to extort Confession right or wrong, is
absolutely laid aside amongst us. Nothing but the Prisoners unforced
Confession, or the Deposition of Witnesses upon Oath made out with good
Circumstances, will take a Man's Life away. The Breaking on the Wheel, and other
like torturing Deaths, are looked upon here as too cruel for Christians to use.
Neither are the Criminals, who with their Lives have expiated their Crimes
before the World, denied Christian Burial, except in particular Cases.

All this shows a great deal of Moderation, and averseness from Cruelty. And,
if we look upon the English in their private Families, there we shall find a
greater Harmony than perhaps in any Nation. For here generally Husbands are the
most Kind to their Wives, Wives as tender of their Husbands, and Parents
indulgent to Children. The first is so great a Truth, that England is every
where acknowledged to be the Paradise of Women, as it is the Hell of Horses.
And it is a common Byword among the Italians, that, if there were a Bridge
over the Narrow Seas, all the Women of Europe would run into England. For here
they are neither so servilely submissive as the French, nor so jealously guarded
as the Italian. Here they have the upper hand in the Streets, the upper place
at Table, the Thirds of their Husbands Estates, and in many Cases share in all
Lands.

I wish I could clear the English as well from Wantonness and Debauchery, as I
have from Cruelty. But, if they have too much degenerated in this point from
their Ancestors, the Reason of it is at hand, Regis ad Exemplum totus
componitur Orbis.

And, if that Rule be constantly true, we have now the fairest Prospect of a
Reformation that ever Nation had, and the greatest Reason to hope shortly to
see the English, now under a sober and religious (as well as a warlike) Prince,
recover their Reputation, which has been so long obscured by the Licentiousness
of two effeminate Reigns.

From their Temper I proceed to their Genius, wherein our Characterizer is no
less abusive. And one would think his too much Learning made him mad, when he
calls the English no less than stolidos, amentes, inertes, that is, witless,
and dull. The Truth is, other Nations are as deeply engaged as the English
against him in this Quarrel, of whom he gives likewise an unmanly Character.
But, to confute him in this Point, this I dare aver, that no Nation has been
more industrious than the English in Mechanic Arts, and the World to this day
is obliged to them for many of their useful Inventions and Discoveries. For
Merchandising and Navigation, no People can compare with them but the
Hollanders, and their great Wealth arising from thence is a plain Proof and
Demonstration of it. For Literature, especially since the Reformation, there is
no Nation in the World so generally knowing. And, as Experimental Philosophy,
so Divinity both Scholastic and Practical has been Improved here beyond all
other Places. Which makes Foreign Divines, and the best sort of them, so
conversant with the learned Works of those famous Lights of the Church, our
best English Divines.

In short, the English Genius is for close Speaking and Writing, and always to
the Point. They look upon loose and rambling Discourses with contempt and
indignation, though they be seasoned with never so much wit. The gaudy part and
pomp of Rhetoric, so much affected by the French, is slighted by the English;
who, like Men of Reason, stick chiefly to Logic. And what they speak in
public they deliver it with a Gravity suitable to the Subject, slighting those
mimical Gesticulations so much used beyond Sea, and endeavoring not so much to
move the Hearer's Affections as to convince his Reason. Gutta cavat Lapidem.

No Nation perhaps is more Satirical, and quicker in Repartees, but still with
much gravity; and I have often wondered at the Acuteness of some of the common
Sort, which argues more Wit than our Censurer allow's.

To express themselves significantly, and with the greatest advantages, they
have a most happy Language, though (like their Blood) it be but a Mixture. For it
is a Compound chiefly of these three, Saxon, Latin, and French; but so that
the Saxon is the Stock, in which the other two are Ingrafted.

As for the Excellency of it, I have little to add to what has been lately
published by Mr. Miege in his Prefatory Discourse to his English Grammar. The
Excellency (says he) of the English Tongue consists in these four Things, viz.
its Facility, Copiousness, Significancy, and Sweetness.

Its Facility is easily demonstrable in its Exemption from Flexions, from that
Multiplicity of Cases, and other Variations, which an Author calls the Emblems
of Babel's Curse and Confusion. The Invariableness of its Nouns Adjective makes
their Concordance easy with the Substantives. The Pronouns, so puzzling and
intricate in French, admit of little difficulty in English; and what is more
easy than the Conjugation of English Verbs? Instead of one Particle (To) used
before the Infinitive, the French have no less than three Prepositions, de, a
and pour, differently used in that Mood. Nor is the English troubled with Verbs
Reciprocal, one of the hardest Ingredients of that Language; especially when
used with an Interrogation, and these intricate Particles en, y, ne, and pas,
the right placing of which is so puzzling to Strangers.

The Copiousness I need not use much art to demonstrate. For, besides the
Treasures of the old Saxon which the English retains in its Monosyllables, the
choicer Wits of the Nation have fetched hither the very Quintessence of some
foreign Languages; who, like Bees, have gathered the best, and left the worst.
By which means they have so happily improved their Mother Tongue, that those
amongst Foreiners who understand the Genius of it are in a maze to see this
Language so far outdo their own, and to find many of their transplanted Words
thrive better in England than in their proper and natural Soil. And, whereas
the French is stinted, and grown barren through its exceeding Nicety, the
English on the contrary is grown mighty Copious, by its innate Liberty of
making such Compounds and Derivatives as are proper and suitable to abridge the
Expression, and to say Multum in parvo. Insomuch that it does almost equalize
the Greek, and even exceed the Latin, in a peculiar grace of compounding Words
together, which is one of the greatest Beauties that can be in a Language. Nor
does its Abundance ly here altogether; there being Court and Country English,
and peculiar Dialects (besides the general one) in the West and North
Countries. In short, no Vulgar Language can deliver a Matter with more Variety,
either plainly by Synonima's, or by Circumlocution with Metaphors.

The Significancy of the English is made out to my hand by the Vindex Anglicus,
in Words to this effect. There is scarce, says he, any Variety that any other
Nation can brag of, but the English has almost with equal felicity made its
own. Witness the Italian Courtier, the French Salust, the Spanish Guzman, the
Latin Naso, and the Greek Polybius. Whoever reads that matchless Essay of Mr.
Sandys upon the Aeneids, would think it writ so by the peerless Maro himself.
How properly has the renowned Lord Bacon taught us to speak the Terms of Art in
our own Language? A Thing Judged impossible, till we saw it performed. What
matchless and incomparable Pieces have we seen in our Time, and where shall one
see more sense in so few Words? What Poetry has more Majesty, and bears a
greater sense than the English, when it flows from a true Poet?

In point of Sweetness, whereas the Italian swarms with Vowels, and the Dutch
with Consonants, the English has the Advantage of them both in a happy Mixture.
It Is true, the Italian is an excellent, Princely, and pleasant Language; but it
wants Sinews, and passes as silent Water. The French is truly delicate, but
something too nice and affected; the Spanish Majestical, but terrible and
boisterous; the Dutch manly, but harsh. Now the English is both sweet, and
manly. It Is true, there are in it some particular sounds unknown to the French
Tongue; which are indeed something harsh and uncouth in the mouth of a French
Learner, and yet very smooth when they run in their proper and natural Channel.
Viz. i long, as in Vice; ou and ow, in Cloud, Vow, etc; o and i, as in God,
Lord, bird, and shirt, pronounced with a mixed sound of the French o and a. But
those which puzzle most of all the French Learner are the found of g before e
and i, and (which is the same Thing,) of j Consonant before any Vowel, as in
ginger, jack, jest, jil, jog, and jug; of ch, as in Chamber; but chiefly of th,
called a t aspirate, as in thanks, thief, thorough, thunder, etc.

In short, such is the mixture of the English, that one may frame his Speech
majestical, pleasant, delicate, or manly, according to the Subject. Of all
which Advantages inherent to the English Tongue Foreiners are at last become
very sensible. For, whereas they used to slight it as an Insular Speech, not
worth their taking notice, they are at present great Admirers of it.

What remains is to answer the usual Objections against it, whereby some People
pretend to degrade it from the Worth of a Language, viz. its Mixture, and
Mutability. Mixture, a Thing so very natural to Languages, that none but the
Hebrew (if that) is free from it. The Latin it self had a great Mixture of
Greek and Gothish. The French consists of Latin, Dutch, and old Gallick. The
Spanish, of Latin, Gothish, and Morisco. And the German it self, as Original
as it is pretended to be, has a taste of the Roman Empire, and the bordering
Neighbors. As for its Mutability, it is at least as groundless an Objection.
For it is well known, that Languages, as States, have their Infancy and Age,
their Wax and Wane.

But now the English Tongue is come to so great Perfection, now it is grown so
very Copious and Significant, by the accession of the quintessence and life of
other Tongues, 'twere to be wished that a stop were put to this unbounded Way
of Naturalizing foreign Words, and that none hereafter should be admitted but
with Judgment and Authority. For the Truth is, there is as much in it as is
needful, and as much as the English Soil is well able to bear.

I conclude, according to the Title of this Chapter, with an Account of the
most famous Men of this Nation, either for Soldiery or Learning, extracted
from Dr. Heylin's Cosmography. Which will serve as a further Confutation of our
Hypercritick Scaliger, and other French conceited Authors since his Time, who
valuing no Nation but their own, made it their Business to decry the English.
But I shall do it with my Author's Caution, that is, without mentioning the
late great Men this Nation has bred, that I may give no ground for
Invidiousness.

The most valorous Soldiers of this Country, when possessed by the Britains,
were
Cassibelane, who twice repulsed the Roman Legions, though conducted by Caesar
himself; and had not a Party here at home been formed against him, it is like he
had been still too hard for the Romans. Prasutagus, King of the Iceni.
Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperor. Arthur, One of the Worlds
Nine Worthies.
In the Times of the Saxons.
Egbert, the last King of the West Saxons, and the first of England. Alfred,
his Grandson, who totally united the Saxon Heptarchy into one Estate, and
subjected the Danes to his Commands, though he could not expel them. Edmund,
surnamed Ironside. Guy, Earl of Warwick.
After the Normans came in.
Richard, and Edward the First, so renowned in the Wars of the Holy Land.
Edward III, and his Son Edward the black Prince, duo Fulmina Belli, famous in
the Wars of France. Henry V, and John Duke of Bedford, his Brother. Montacute,
Earl of Salisbury. Sir John Falstaff, and Sir John Hawkwood, who showed their
Valor both in France and Italy. Hawkins, Willoughby, Buroughs, Jenkinson,
Drake, Frobisher, Cavendish, and Greenvile, all famous Sea-Captains.
Scholars of most note,
Alcuinus, one of the Founders of the University of Paris. Beda, who for his
Piety and Learning obtained the Attribute of Venerabilis. Anselm, and
Bradwardin, Archbishops of Canterbury, Men famous for the Times they lived in.
Alexander of Hales, Tutor to Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. Wicleff, and
Thomas of Walden his Antagonist, the first Parson of Lutterworth in the County
of Leicester, who valiantly opposed the Power and Errors of the Church of
Rome.
And since the Reformation,
John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury, to whose learned and industrions Labors in
defense of the Religion here established by Law we are still beholden. Dr. John
Raynolds, and Mr. Richard Hooker; the first a Man of infinite Reading, the
second of as strong a Judgment. Dr. Whitaker of Cambridge, the Antagonist of
the famous Bellarmine. Dr. Tho. Bilson, and Dr. Lancelot Andrews; both Bishops
of Winchester, the Ornaments of their several Times. Bishop Montague of
Norwich, a great Philologer and Divine. Dr. John Whitgift, and Dr. William
Laud, Archbishops of Canterbury.
But I cannot pass by the remarkable Story of the foresaid Dr. John Raynolds,
and William his Brother. William was at first a Protestant of the Church of
England, and John trained up beyond Sea in Popery. The first, out of an honest
Zeal to reduce his Brother, made a Journey to him, and they had a Conference.
Where it so fell out, that each was overcome with his Brothers Arguments; so
that William of a Zealous Protestant became a virulent Papist, and John of a
strong Papist a most rigid Protestant. A strange Accident, and a rare subject
for this excellent Epigram, made upon it by Dr. Alabaster, who had tried both
Religions.

Bella inter geminos plusquam Civilia Fratres
Traxerat ambiguus Religionis Apex.
Ille Reformatae Fidei pro partibus instat,
Iste Reformandam denegat esse Fidem.
Propositis Causae Rationibus, alter utrinque,
Concurrere pares, and cecidere pares.
Quod fuit in Votis, Fratrem capit alter-uterque;
Quod fuit in Fatis, perdit uterque Fidem.
Captivi gemini sine Captivante fuerunt,
Et Victor Victi transfuga Castra petit.
Quod genus hoc Pugnae est, ubi Victus gaudet uterque
Et tamen alteruter se superasse dolet?
For Men of other Studies,
Lindwood, the Canonist. Cosins, and Cowel, eminent in the Civil Laws. Bracton,
Briton, Dier, and Coke, as eminent for their Knowledge in the Laws of England.
Johannes de Sacro Bosco, the Author of the Book of the Sphere. Roger Bacon, a
noted Mathematician in the darker Times. The Lord Bacon. Viscount of S. Albans.
Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor, one of the Restorers of Learning to the Isle
of Great Britain. Sir Henry Savile of Eaton, the Reviver of Chrysostom. Sir
Henry Spelman, a learned Antiquary, and a religious Assertor of the Churches
Rights. Cambden, the Pausanias of the British Islands. Matthew Paris, Roger
Hoveden, Henry of Huntington, William of Malmesbury, Matthew of Westminster,
and Thomas of Walsingham, all known Historians. For Poetry, Gower, and Lydgate,
a Monk of Bury. The famous Geosry Chaucer, Brother in Law to John of Gaunt, the
great Duke of Lancaster. Sir Philip Sidney, and the Renowned Spencer. Sam.
Daniel, and Michael Drayton, That the Lucan, and This the Ovid of the English
Nation. Beaumont, and Fletcher, not inferior unto Terence and Plantus. And
lastly, Ben. Johnson, equal to any of the Ancients for the exactness of his
Pen, and the Decorum he kept in the Dramatick Poems, never before observed on
the English Theater.
CHAP. II.
Of the English Names, and of their Way of Computing.

CHristian Names, says Cambden, were first imposed for the Distinction of
Persons; Surnames, for the Distinction of Families.

The first, amongst the English, are either Saxon; as Edward, Gilbert, Henry,
Richard, Walter, William, etc. Or taken out of the Holy Writ; as Abraham,
Jacob, James, Jsaac, etc.

It Is rare for the English to have two Christen Names together, as they have in
Germany. But it is not unusual with them to christen Children by their
Godfathers Surnames, which is unpractised beyond Sea.

The Ancients took particular care to give their Children significative and
good Names, according to the Proverb, Bonum Nomen, Bonum Omen. And the
Pythagoreans affirmed the Minds, Actions, and Successes of Men to be according
to their Fate, Genius, and Name. In short, such was Men's Superstition of old in
this particular, that they used a kind of Divination by Names, called
Onomantia, which was condemned by the last General Council.

The Story of Augustus the Emperor is remarkable upon this Subject. The Day
before his Sea Fight at Actium, the first Man he met was a poor Man, driving
his Ass before him. Augustus demanded his Name; and he answered Eutyches, that
is, Happy-man; then he asked his Asse's Name, which proved to be Nicon, that
is, Victor. Augustus took it for a good Omen; and having accordingly obtained
the Victory, there he built Nicopolis, or the City of Victory, and erected
brazen Images of the Man and his Ass.

Alfonso IV. King of Castille had two Daughters, by one of the Daughters of
Henry II. King of England. The Eldest, Vrraca by Name, was far surpassing her
Sister Blanch in beauty. Lewis VIII. of France sent to Alfonso, to demand one
of the Daughters. They were both presented to the Ambassadors Choice; who,
inquiring of their Names, preferred the Lady Blanch, and made choice of her,
contrary to all expectation. The Name of Vrraca, though the more beautiful
Lady, proved unpleasing; and that of the Lady Blanch, signifying Fair and
Beautiful, carried it, as a Name that would be more acceptable in France.

For my part, though I am not so much a Pythagorean as to think a Man's Name
should interpret his Fate; yet I think it not amiss to name Children with Names
of a happy signification, as it was usual among the Primitive Christians, were
it but to stir them up to live according to their Names, and not give
themselves the lie.

As for the English Surnames, they are generally Saxon, some few Danish, as
Whitfeld, and Wren. The Whitfelds, a very ancient Family, came over with King
Canute into England; and their chief Br^nch is continued to this day in
Northumberland, with a good Estate. In Q. Elizabeth's Time, there was a Whitfeld
sent hither Ambassador from the King of Denmark.

But the Surnames now of best account in England are Local, and so were many
Names among the Romans. Those you will find deduced from Places in Normandy, or
Countries adjacent; being either the Patrimonial Possessions, or native Places
of such as served the Conqueror, or came in after out of Normandy. As Mortimer,
Albigny, Percy, Gournay, Devereux, Nevil, Ferrers, Montfort, Courtney, Cressy,
etc. Or from Places in England, and Scotland; as Barkley, Clifford, Lumley,
Ratcliff, Willoughby, Douglas.

Some of which Local Names were formerly used with de, prefixed; but of late
generally neglected, or joined to the Name, as Darcy, Devereux. Others had at
prefixed, as At More, At Wood, At Down, which has been removed from some, and
has been conjoined to others, as in these, Atmore, Atwood, Atwells, etc.

Many have also had their Names from Rivers, as Trent, Eden, Swale, Stoure.
From Trees near their Habitations, as Oak, Box, Elder, Beech. Some from their
Situation in respect to adjoining Places; as North, South, East, West,
according to the Greek Names Anatolius, Zephyrius, etc. Others from several
Parts of a House; as Hall, Parlour, Cellar, Lodge, etc. From Towns where they
were born, or from whence they came, without being Lords or Possessors of them;
as Compton, Egerton. Or from several Denominations of Land and Water, as Hill,
Wood, Warren, Field, Ford, Pool, and Wells.

Among Foreiners, several retained the Names of their Countries; as Scot,
Picard, Fleming, French, Lombard, Poitevin, German. And these had commonly Le
prefixed in Records, and other Writings, as Le Fleming, Le Picard.

Next to these Local Names, I shall take notice of those that have been assumed
by some Families from Civil Honors, and Dignities; as King, Duke, Prince,
Lord, Baron, Knight, and Squire, probably because their Ancestors ha^acted such
Parts, or were Kings of the Bean, Christmas Lords, etc. Agreeable to which are
the old Greek and Roman Names, Archelaus, Augustulus, Regulus, Basilius,
Caesarius, Flaminius, though they were neither Kings, Caesar's, Dukes, or
Priests.

Others have been assumed from Offices; as Chamberlain, Steward, Page, Cook,
Spencer, Gardener, Butler, Porter, Foster, Parker, Faulconer, Fowler, Forester,
Woodward, Clark, Sergeant, etc. From Ecclesiastical Functions; as Bishop,
Abbot, Priest, Monk, Dean, Deacon. But most of all from Trades; as Tailor,
Smith, Potter, Fisher, Baker, Chapman, Spelman, etc.

Some from Parts of the Body; as Head, Arm, Leg, Foot. Others from Qualities of
the Body, good or bad; as Greathead, Whitehead, Strong, Armstrong, Long, Low,
Short, Fair, and Bell in the same sense, Fairfax, and Whitelock, in the same
sense, Thin, Heile or healthful, etc. No more to be disliked than these Roman
Names, Romulus and Nero, which signify Strong, Capito, Ped^, Labeo, Naso,
Longus, Longinus, Minutius, Crispus, Calvus, Gracchus, Salustius, Cocles, and
the like.

Not a few got their Names from the Color of their Complexions, Hair, or
Garments; As, White, Black, Brown, Red, Green, and these Norman Names, Blanch
or white, Blount for Blond Flaxen Hair, Rous for Roux red, and these derived
from the two last, viz. Blundell, Russel. Others have received their Names from
their Age; as Young, Old, Child, Stripling. In Imitation of the Romans
Juvenalis, Junius, Virginius, Senecio, Priscus. Others again from that which
they commonly carried; as Palmer, and Wagstaff.

Some from the Qualities of the Mind; as Good, Goodman, Goodenough, Wise,
Sharp, Speed. And such the Greeks and Romans of old had; witness Agathias,
Andragathius, Eubulus, Eumenius, Sophocles, Thraseas, Prudentius, Lepidus,
Valens, Constans.

Some took their Names from Beasts; as Lamb, Lion, Bear, Buck, Fox, Hind,
Hound, Hare, Hog, Pig, Roe, Badger, etc. And the like you will find among the
noblest Romans; as Leo, Catulus, Lupus, Leporius, Aper, Apronius, Caninius,
Castor. Cyrus (a Dog) was common amongst the Persians.

Others derive their Surnames from Birds; as Eagle, Kite, Swan, Wildgoose,
Gosling, Partridge, Parrat, Woodcock, Alcock, Wilcock, Handcock, Peacock, Dove,
Lark, Finch, Chaffinch, Nightingale, Wren, Hulet or Howlet, Corbet or Raven,
Arundel or Swallow. As good as these Roman Names, Corvinus, Aquilius, Milvius,
Gallus, Picus, Falco, Livia, or Stock-Dove.

From Fishes; as Salmon, Trout, Plaice, Sole, Gurnard, Herring, Pike,
Pickerell, Bream, Burt, Whiting, Crab, Mullet, Base, etc. Nothing inferior to
these Roman Names, Muraena, Phocas, Aurata, etc. which happily they took, or
were given them, because they loved these Fishes best.

From Flowers, and Fruits, as Lilly, Rose, Peach, Filbert, Pescod. As fair
Names as Len^^lus, Piso, Fabius, which sounded great amongst the Romans.

Many have got their Surnames by adding s to Christen Names, as Philips,
Williams, Rogers, Peter's, Davis, Harris, Roberts, Simonds, Guyse, Stephens,
Richards, Hughs, Jones, etc. Others, by adding of s to these Nicknames or
Nurse-Names; as Robins, Nicks, Nichols, Thoms, Dicks, Hicks, Wills, Sims, Sams,
Collins, Jenks, Hodges, Hobs, Saunders, Gibs, Wats, etc.

Many likewise have been made by adjoining Kins to those Nurse-Names, making
them as it were Diminutives: As Dickins from Dicks, Perkins from Peir for
Peter, Tomkins from Tom, Wilkins from Will, Lambkins from Lambert, Hobkins and
Hopkins from Hob, Atkins from Arthur, Jenkins from John, Watkins from Wat,
Tipkins from Tibald, Daukins from Davy. And so did the Romans vary their Names;
as Constans, Constantius, Constantinus, Justus, Justulus, Justinus,
Justinianus, Aurelius, Aureolus, Aurelianus, Augustus, Augustinus,
Augustinianus, Augustulus, etc.

Or else, by adding ins to curtailed Names; as Hutchins, Huggins, Hitchins, and
Higgins from Hugh, Gibbins from Gibby, Jennings from John, and Rawlins from
Raoul, that is, Ralph.

To which add Diminutive Surnames, ending in et or ot; as Willet from Will,
Bartlet from Bartholomew, Millet from Miles, Huet from Hugh, Eliot from Elias.

But you will find many more of these Diminutive Surnames, by the addition of
Son, to the Father's Christian or Nickname. As Williamson, Richardson, Dickson,
Harrison, Gibson, Simson, Stevenson, Robinson, Nicholson, Tomson, Wilson,
Watson, Wilkinson, Johnson, Jackson, Sanderson, and Pattison from Patrick.

To which answers the ancient Way of Norman Families, when a Son took for his
Surname his Fathers Christen-Name, with the wor^ Fitz prefixed, which signified
Son. As Rob^^ Fitz-William, that is, Robert the Son of William; Henry Fitz
Gerard, that is, Henry the Son of Gerard.

What remains is to answer the Question, how people came by their Names.
Cambden thinks (as it is probable enough) that some took up their Names
themselves, and others had their Names given them by the People, in whom lies
the Sovereignty of Words and Names. Amongst the first he reckons those that
assumed local Names of such Places as they were Owners of. And, amongst the
Authors of the last, especially the Diminutives, he brings in the Nurses as the
principal.

Neither is it improbable, says he, but that many Names, that seem unfitting
for Men, as those of brutish Beasts, etc. came from the very Signs of the
Houses where they inhabited. And he alleges for Instance some that, living at
the Sign of the Dolphin, Bull, and White-Horse, were commonly called Thomas at
the Dolphin, Will at the Bull, George at the White-Horse. Which Names (as many
others of the like sort) with omitting At, became afterward hereditary to
their Children.

Another Thing observable in Names is their frequent Change, a Thing practiced
of old by the Romans themselves. For some have changed their Names, to avoid
the Opinion of Baseness; others, in remembrance of their more honorable
Progenitors. Some upon the Account of Adoption, others in remembrance of some
particular Favors. Some again, by taking the Names of those whose Lands they
had; and others, by taking the Name of their own Office. As when Edward
Fitz-Theobald was made Butler of Ireland, the Earls of Ormond, and others
descended from them, took the Name of Butler.

The Pride of Scholars has also wrought Alterations in some Names. And the fear
of Punishment has been all along the Occasion of several Men's changing their
Names, to avoid being discovered. But Time especially has changed Names the
most, by contracting, curtailing, and mollifying of them in such a manner, that
they are quite another Thing from what they were at first.

Lastly, Foreiners may observe, that Women in England at their Marriage change
their Surnames, and pass into their Husbands Names. Which is but reasonable,
because married people Non sunt duo, sed Caro una, they are but one Flesh. And
yet in France, and elsewhere, married Women retain so far their own Names with
their Husbands, as to write themselves by their Fathers Surnames.

I come now to the English Way of Computing. Who do not begin the Year till the
25th of March, being the Day of Christ's Incarnation; wherein they agree with
Spain. This is the Rule, both in Church and State; according to which they date
all their public Writings. Though, according to the Cycles of the Sun and
Moon, they allow the Year to begin only the first of January; which therefore
is by them called, as by most other Christians in Europe, the New Years Day.
And, to distinguish that mongrel Time from the first of January to the 25th of
March following, it is usual with many, in the Dates of their Letters during
that Interval, to set down both the Years thus, as from the 1st of January
1688. to the 25th of March 1689/90

As for the Natural Day, consisting of 24 hours, the English begin (as most
Parts of Europe do) at Midnight, counting 12 hours to Noon the next Day, and 12
hours more to next Midnight; according to the Custom of the Egyptians, and
ancient Romans. Whereas in some other Countries, as Italy, Poland, and Bohemia,
they reckon 24 hours together, from Sunset to Sunset, which must needs be
very troublesome to tell after the Clock. In Moscovy, and some Places in Germany
(as Nuremberg, and Wirtemberg) they begin the Day and end it with the Sun; so
that the first Hour of the Day is with them at Sun rise, and the first hour of
the Night at Sunset, which is according to the old Babylonian Account.

The Old Style is used in England, as in most Protestant States; and the New
Style, in all Popish States. According to this Style, these reckon ten Days
before us regularly, as to the beginning of Months, and all fixed Festivals; but
for all moveable Feasts, the Account proves various.

The Old Style is otherwise called the Julian Account, from Julius Caesar; who,
43 Years before our Saviors Birth, ordained the Year to consist of 365 Days
and 6 ^ours. And, as these 6 hours, at 4 Years end, make up 24 hours, therefore
a Day is then added to the Month of February; and that Year called Leap Year,
or Bissextile Year, from the Latin Bissextilis.

The New Style is otherwise termed the Gregorian Account, from Pope Gregory
XIII; who, above 100 Years ago, undertook to correct the Calendar, by the
advice and direction of Antonius Lilius, and other excellent Mathematicians.
For, tho the Julian Account for many Ages seemed to have no sensible Error;
yet it was at last discovered to be not altogether agreeable with the natural
Motion of the Sun. In short, it was made out, that the Julian Year exceeded the
true Solar Year by 10 Minutes and 48 Seconds; whereby the Equinoxes and
Solstices yearly changed their places, and flew back so many minutes and
seconds. Therefore Pope Gregory ordered the Year to consist of 365 Days, 5
hours, 49 minutes, 12 seconds. And, that the Vernal Equinox (which then was on
the 11th of March) might be reduced to the 21th, as it was at the time of the
first Nicene Council, he commanded ten Days in October to be left out, by
calling the fifth Day thereof the fifteenth.

To find Easter, the Church of England observes still the Cycle found out and
finished in the sixth Century by that worthy Roman, Dionysius Exiguus, or Abas.
Whereas the Roman Church, having invented new Rules about Easter, it happens
sometimes that their Easter is full five Weeks before ours, sometimes with, but
never after ours.

CHAP. III.
Of the English Way of Living, as to Lodging, Fuel, Food, Raiment, Exercise,
Recreations, and some particular Customs.

WHen I compare the Modern English Way of Building with the Old Way, I cannot
but wonder at the Genius of old Times. Nothing is more delightful and
convenient than Light, nothing more agreeable to health than a free Air. And
yet of old they used to dwell in Houses, most with a blind Staircase, low
Cielings, and dark Windows; the Rooms built at random, often with Steps from
one to another. So that one would think the Men of former Ages were afraid of
Light and good Air, or loved to play at Hide and Seek. Whereas the Genius of
our time is altogether for lightsom Stair-Cases, fine Sash-Windows, and lofty
Cielings. And such has been of late our Builders Industry, in point of
Compactness and Uniformity, that a House after the new Way will afford upon the
same Quantity of Ground as many more Conveniences.

The Contrivance of Closets in most Rooms, and the painted Wainscotting now so
much used, are also two great Improvements; the one for Convenience, the other
for Cleanness and Health. And indeed, for so damp a Country as England is,
nothing could be better contrived than Wainscot, to keep off the ill Impression
of damp Walls. In short, for handsome Accommodations and Neatness of Lodgings,
London undoubtedly has got the preeminence.

The greatest Objection against the London-Houses (being for the most part
Brick) is their Slightness, occasioned by the Fines exacted by the Landlords.
So that few Houses, at the common rate of Building, last longer than the
Ground-Lease, that is about 50 or 60 Years. In the mean time, if there happens
to be a long fit of excessive Heat in Summer or Cold in Winter, the Walls being
but thin, become at last so penetrated with the Air, that the Tenant must needs
be uneasy with it. But those Extremes happen but seldom. And this Way of
Building is wonderful beneficial to all Trades relating to it; for they never
want Work in so great a City, where Houses here and there are always repairing,
or building up again.

The plaistered Cielings, so much used in England beyond all other Countries,
make by their Whiteness the Rooms so much lightsomer, and are excellent against
a raging Fire. They stop the passage of Dust, and lessen the Noise overhead. In
Summertime the Air of the Room is something the cooler for it, and the warmer
in Winter.

The Use of Stoves, so common in Northern Countries, as Germany, Denmark,
Sueden, Poland, and Moscovy, and even so far Southward as Swisserland, is in a
manner unknown in this Country. And indeed its Temperateness does no way
require it. Therefore the English use no outward Remedy against Cold Weather
but a Chimney-Fire, which is both comfortable to the Body, and cheerful to the
Sight. It Is true, there is a double Convenience in Stoves. First in point of
Savingness, for once heating of a Stove in the Morning, keeps the Room warm a
whole Day. Secondly, in Point of Warmth, the Room being so warm with it, that
all Places in it feel the benefit thereof. But those two Conveniences are more
than over-ballanced by one Inconveniency, viz. the aptness of Stoves to gather
and foment all the noisome Smells of a Room for want of Vent, which must needs
be very unwholsom; whereas a Chimney-fire draws 'em to it, and there they find
vent with the Smoke. To that Inconveniency we may add the chilling Impressions
of a cold and sharp Air, upon ones coming into it out of so warm a Room as
commonly Stove-rooms are. Besides the Cumbersomness of Stoves in Summertime,
when being altogether useless, they take up a great deal of room to no purpose.

As for Fuel, England affords three Sorts, Wood, Coals, and Turves; but Coals
is the most common, in London especially, where they have 'em by Sea from
Newcastle and Sunderland. A lasting sort of Fuel, being a mixture of small and
round Coals together, which by their aptness to cake, is the most durable of
any; and for Kitchen Use, far beyond Wood it self, as yielding not only a more
even, but more piercing Heat. The Smoke of it is indeed grosser, and of a
corrosive nature; but yet nothing so offensive to the Eye, whatever it is to
the Lungs, as some pretend it to be. In many Parts of the Country they have
Pit-coals, which is a cleaner and more cheerful Fuel, but not so durable as
Sea-coals. But the Cheapness of these at London in Time of Peace is worth
taking notice; where for so small a matter as two or three pence a Day one may
keep a constant moderate Fire from Morning till Bedtime. Which is a mighty
Advantage to so vast and populous a Place, especially considering it comes 300
miles by Sea. And whatever the Parisians can say to the praise of their
Woodfires, I dare say the common sort of People there would be glad, could they
compass it, to change in Wintertime Fuel with the Londoners.

The English Diet falls next under our Consideration; which for the eating
part, does most consist in Flesh, and chiefly in Butchers Meat. For, though
they have great Plenty and Variety of Fish and Fowl, Roots and Herbs, yet they
are most commonly used but as a Supplement or an Accessory to the Principal.
And therefore the English ever went amongst Strangers for the greatest
Flesh-eaters. Which is certainly the best, and the most proper nourishment for
this Country.

But, whereas formerly the English used to eat three or Four Meals a Day, the
generality of them, since the long Civil Wars in the Reign of Char. I. have
used themselves to eat but one Meal a Day. If then they eat plentifully, and
perhaps beyond the rate of other People, who eat three or four times a Day, it
is no matter of amazement. Some thing more than ordinary must be laid up in
store, to hold out 24 Hours. There is the less Time lost in eating, and the
more saved for Business. So that, if other Nations live to eat, the English may
be said to eat only to live. In short, all things considered, we may reckon the
English, (who heretofore were perhaps not unjustly taxed of Gluttony, and to be
a People most given to their Bellies) to be now one of the most sober Nations
of Europe, as to Eating.

Not but that in their Feastings, both public and private, they are as great
as any Nation. Witness (for public ones) the Feasts at Coronations, at the
Installation of the Knights of the Garter, Consecration of Bishops,
Intertainments of Ambassadors, the Feasts of the Lord Mayor of London, of
Sergeants at Law, and of Readers in the Inns of Court. And yet, as sumptuous
and magnificent as they are in these Times, they are not to compare to the
wonderful Feastings of elder Times. It Is recorded (says Dr. Chamberlain,) of
Richard Earl of Cornwall, Brother to Henry III, that at his Marriage Feast he
had thirty thousand Dishes of Meat; and that King Richard II, spent daily at a
Christmas 26 Oxen, and 300 Sheep, besides Fowl, and all other Provision
proportionably. Anciently, says Fortescue, at a Call of Sergeants at Law, each
Sergeant spent 1600 Crowns in Feasting, which in those Days was more than 1600
Pounds now.

But the Civil Wars aforesaid are not the only Thing which has brought the
English to this Moderation of eating but one Meal a Day. The frequent Use of
Tobacco, Tea, and Coffee, has had also a great hand in it. And the Experience
of making but slight Suppers, or rather of turning Suppers into Beverages, has
proved so conducive to Health, that few People in England make a set Supper.
Whereas, beyond Sea, it is counted the principal Meal.

The Plainness of the English Diet is also very observable in point of Health.
Their usual Way is downright Boiled and Roasted, without any Sophistication;
and it is certainly the most agreeable to ones Health. The French Kickshaws are
mere Kitchen Sophistry, invented more toplease a curious Palate, than to
satisfy a natural Appetite. Their Cooks mere Legerdemains. You take one thing
for another, the proper Taste of the Meat is gone, and another by the virtue of
Coquus Pocus is substituted: Thus the Palate is gratified, and the Stomach
cheated. It Is true, the dainty Frenchified Palates in England love this kind of
Transmigration; but those who are for Variety, may find here pretty Knacks
enough, without running to France for it. For Pastry no Nation excels the
English, but in Venison-Pasties they excel all Nations.

But if we go from the Kitchen to the Buttery, here indeed the English Butler
does outdo the French Cook in point of Variety. Besides the Diversity of Wines
from abroad, from the East and from the South, here we find Beer and Ale, small
and strong of both sorts; and of the last twenty Species, all noted for some
peculiar quality, most for their strength. Nothing pleasanter than this to the
Eye, or to the Palate, when skill and age has brought it to perfection; but
nothing more treacherous. It goes down gently and palatably; but, as if it were
too noble a Liquor for those lower Parts, it presently flies up to the Head,
and puts all there in a confusion. So quick is the Operation of those strong
sorts of Liquors, upon too large a Dose, that they run a Man out of his Senses,
before he can have an Interval of Mirth. I speak of Men that are not so well
used to those sorts of Liquors as the North Country Men are, who know best how
to deal with them.

But, besides the Variety of Wines from abroad, of Beer and Ale brewed at home,
here is drunk abundance of Sider, Perry, Mead, Metheglin, Mum, and since the
Plague, French Brandy, and Irish Usquebach: two dangerous sorts of Drink, when
taken immoderately. To conclude, I wish I could say the English are as sober in
point of Drinking, as they are in their Eating. But, since Scaliger's Time,
they have in a great measure clubbed with the Germans, their old Kindred, in the
Character he gives of these in one of his Epigrams.

Tres sunt Convivae, Germanus, Flander, and Anglus;
Dic quis edat melius, quis meliusve bibat.
Non comedis, Germane, bibis; tu non bibis Angle,
Sed comedis; comedis Flandre, bibisque been.
In English thus. Dutch, Flemings, English, are your only Guests;
Say which of all does eat, or drink it best.
The English love most to eat, the Dutch to swill,
Only the Fleming eats and drinks his fill.


Thus was it in Scaliger's time with the English Nation. But now the Case is
altered, so far at least as concerns the English, who are at this time less
Eaters, but more addicted to Drinking than formerly; and yet not to that excess
neither generally, as the Germans are.

The Use of Coffee and Tea, two sober Liquours now so prevalent in England,
does take off people considerably from drinking of strong Liquours. And, were
it but for that, the Coffee-houses ought to be kept up and encouraged.

Now Coffee is made with the berries of a Tree that grows in the Levant, and
Tea with the leaves of an India Plant; both hot and dry, and therefore very
proper for Phlegmatic people. And, whereas strong Liquours are apt to disorder
the Brain, these on the contrary do settle and compose it. Which makes it so
much used by Men of Learning and Business, who know best the virtue of 'em.

As for Tobacco, the Use whereof is indeed more universal, it is a Remedy for
phlegmatic people, and consequently not amiss in this Country. It Is a Companion
in Solitude, an Amusement in Company, an innocent Diversion to Melancholy, and
a Help to Fancy in private Studies and Meditations.

I come now to the English Wearing Apparel, wherein this Nation has showed in
former Ages much Pride and Levity. So foolish and extravagant they were, so
superfluous and obscene, that diverse Statutes were made against that Excess,
even before the Reformation. Then an Englishman was wont to be pictured naked,
with a pair of Sheers in his hand, a piece of Cloth under his Arm, and Verses
annexed, intimating that he knew not what fashion of Clothes to have. In Q.
Elizabeth's Time, sometimes they took up the German, and sometimes the Spanish
Mode. But the French Fashion has prevailed for the most part since. Only there
was a Time in King Charles the second his Reign, that is, about 23 Years since,
when Men took up a grave sort of Habit, something like that of the Oriental
Nations. But it was soon laid aside, and the French Mode taken up again, which
has continued ever since.

Cloth, amongst Men, is the general and almost the only Wear. And that with so
much plainness and comeliness, with so much modesty and so little prodigality,
that the English, formerly so apish in imitating foreign Nations in their Garb,
might go now for a Model. The Women indeed, who value themselves most upon a
fine outward Appearance, cannot keep within those Bounds. Whether it be to make
a Figure in the World, or out of Emulation amongst themselves, or out of Design
upon Men, they go still in rich Silks, with all the Set-offs that Art can
possibly invent from time to time. They know that Love does love Toys, and that
Men love to be caught in a fine Net. And herein the Citizens Wives, and
Maidservants, do run into such Excess as makes a Confusion. So hard it is
sometimes to know a Tradesmans Wife from a Lady, or the Maid from the Mistress.

As for the English Exercises and Recreations, some they have common with other
Nations, as Hunting, Hawking, Fowling, Fishing, Tennis, Bowling, Shooting at
Bow and Arrows, Leaping, Wrestling, Dancing, Music, Stage Plays, Operas,
Mascarades, Balls, Ballets, etc. Amongst which their Way of Bowling in fine
Greens, contrived and kept for that purpose, is beyond any Thing that foreign
Countries do afford. Wrestling is an Exercise, wherein they have a peculiar
Skill, but chiefly the North and Western People. Their Music, like their
Temper, inclines to gravity. And, if France outdo's the English in Comedies,
England may be said to outdo all Europe in Tragedies.

But, besides those Exercises and Recreations usual with other Nations, they
have some more peculiar to themselves; such as Paddock-Courses, Horse-races,
Cock-fighting, Bear-baiting, Bull-baiting, Prizes, Cudgels, Football, Throwing
at Cocks, and their Way of Ringing of Bells. Amongst which the Races show the
Swiftness of English Horses brought up for that purpose, which to Foreiners
unacquainted with it go's almost for a Romance. Cock-fighting shows the Courage
of their Cocks; Bear-baiting, and Bull-baiting that of their Dogs; and Prizes,
the dexterity of some Men in handling of Weapons, though with some effusion of
Blood. Foot ball is a rude Diversion for the common sort of People in frosty
Weather. Throwing at Cocks is not only rude, but cruel. And, as to the Musical
Way of Ringing the Bells in England, the frequency of it makes it rather a
Recreation to the Ringers than others.

The Public Days for Feasting, amongst the English, are first the Holy Days
at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, but chiefly Christmas Holy Days: When
it is usual for Landlords to treat their Tenants, for Relations and Friends to
invite each other, and pass the Time in Merriments. And, though those Holy Days
are not kept of late Years with that Profuseness as formerly they were; yet I
could wish they were kept with more devotion, and less intemporateness.

From All Saints Day to Candlemas, it is usual for each Inn of Court to have
Revels on Holy Days, that is, Music and Dancing; and for this they choose some
young Student to be Master of the Revels. Before Christmas, the Students, who
are for the most part Gentlemen of quality that come hither only to learn so
much Law as may serve their turn to preserve their Estates, meet together in
order to keep a solemn Christmas. At this Meeting, which they call a
Parliament, Officers are chosen from among them to bear Rule in the House
during the whole Christmas; as a Comptroller, Treasurer, etc. Sometimes, when
their public Treasury can reach it, they make a Prince among themselves, who
keeps a Court accordingly. By whom many of the chief Nobility and great
Officers of State are feasted, and entertained with Interludes, etc.

But, whether a Prince or no, the whole Christmas-time (except Sundays) is
devoted here to Feasting, Music, Dancing, and Di^ing. This last, being allowed
to all Comers, is so excessive, that the Box-mony does usually amount to about
50 l. each 24 hours. Which Money go's a great way toward the defraying the
Charges of the whole Christmas, the rest being made up by a Contribution from
each Student.

But, besides Christmas Holy Days (which may be called the Carnaval of England)
there are other Days of public Rejoicing. As, the King and Queens Birth and
Coronation-Days; the present Kings Birthday being the 4th of November, the
Queens the 30th of April, and their Coronation Day April the 11th.

The 5th of November, being Gunpowder Treason Day, when the Popish
Conspirators had prepared all Things to blow up King James I. and his
Parliament then sitting, is a Day of Thanksgiving, solemnly kept to the eternal
Confusion of Popery. This is the Day, when the Pope, by way of Retaliation,
used solemnly to be burnt in Effigy at Temple Bar in King Charles the Seconds
Time, with so much State and Pomp, that the Undertakers spared for nothing to
have it done suitable to the Subject. But, this being discontinued, since the
late King came to the Crown, and being looked upon besides by sober people as a
Piece of Exorbitancy, I have done with it, and hope it will not be renewed.

My Lord Mayors Day, being the 29th of October, is also a solemn Day of public
Rejoicing and Feasting for the City of London. Societies have likewise their
Feasting Days, when they meet in a Body, either upon the Election of a new
Officer, or on some other account. But, of all the Societies, there is none to
be compared in this point to the Inns of Court, for state and magnificence.

As to private Families, it is usual with many to celebrate their Birth and
Marriage-Days with their most intimate Friends.

To improve Society, the life of Recreation, the English have, besides their
usual and friendly Meetings called Clubs, the Convenience of Coffee-Houses,
more common here than any where else. In these all Comers intermix together,
with mutual freedom; and, at the small Charge of a penny or two pence of such
Liquours as are sold there, Men have the Opportunity of meeting together, and
getting Acquaintance, with choice of Conversation, and the advantage of reading
all foreign and domestic News.

S. Bartholomew's (vulgarly called Bartelmy) Fair is a particular Time for
Diversion to the City of London. It begins on S. Bartholomew's Day the 24th of
August, and continues 14 Days in West-Smithfield; at the end whereof it removes
for so many Days more to Southwark, on the other side of the River. Then is the
dead Time of the Year, which amongst Citizens is the most proper for their
Diversion. This Fair is famous, not so much for Things bought or sold, as for
its great Variety of Shows, either of Nature or Art. So that one may apply to
it what the Romans of old used to say of Africa, Quid novi fert Africa? For
here is always to be seen strange sorts of living Creatures. And for such as
love Feats of Activity, Comical, or Tragical Shows, here they are to be seen in
the utmost persection. Which draws daily during the Fair a great Concourse of
people, to the benefit of the Shewers and the satisfaction of the Beholders.

And now, amongst the English particular Customs, I shall in the first place
take notice of their Way of Pledging one another, whereof this is the Original.
When the Danes Lorded it over England, they used, when the English drank, to
stab them, or cut their Throats. To avoid which Villainy, the Party then
drinking requested some of the next to him to be his Surety or Pledge, for his
Life. From whence came the Expression used to this day of Pledging one another,
when the Party drunk to takes his turn, and drinks next after him.

Another Custom the English had formerly upon the Danes account; which Time has
so corrupted, that there remains no sign of the first Institution, except in
the Name Hock-tide, an old Saxon Word, which signify's the Time of Scorning, or
Triumphing. The English, in the Reign of King Ethelred, were so oppressed and
broken by the Danes, that Ethelred was fain to buy his Peace of them at the
yearly Tribute of 10000 pound, soon after inhaunced to 48000, which Moneys were
raised upon the Subjects by the Name of Danegelt. But the King, weary of this
Exaction, plotted with his Subjects to kill all the Danes, as they slept in
their Beds. Which was accordingly done on S. Brice's Night, Nov. 12.1012. The
joyful English, having thus cleared their Country of the Danes, instituted the
annual Sports of Hock tide; in Imitation of the Romans Fugalia, at the
expulsion of their Kings. This Solemnity consisted in the merry Meerings of the
Neighbors in those Days during which the Festival lasted, and was celebrated
by the younger sort of both Sexes, with all manner of Exercises and Pastimes in
the Streets. At Coventry they yearly acted a Play called Hock-Tuesday, till Q.
Elizabeth's Time.

The 14th of February, being S. Valentines Day, has been kept Time out of mind,
(and is so to this day) both by the English and Scots, with some relation to
the Instinct of Animals. For Nature teaches us, that about this time of the
Year the Beasts of the Field and Fowls of the Air feeling a new heat by the
approach of the Sun, the Males choose their Females, and begin to couple. From
whence it is probable young Men and Maidens took occasion to meet together at
this time to an equal Number; and, having their respective Names writ down
severally upon pieces of paper rolled up, the Men draw the Maidens Names, and
these the Men's. So the Lot gives every Man a She Valentine, and every Maid a He
one; the Men wearing their Lots for some Days rolled up about their Hat-bands,
and the Women before their Breast. Whereupon they make each other a Present,
and sometimes it comes to be a Match in good earnest.

These Particulars, so well known to the whole Nation, I would not have
insisted upon, but for the satisfaction of Foreiners. Upon whose Account I
shall likewise explain, but in few Words, the Story of the Welsh Custom of
wearing Leeks on their Hats the first day of March, being S. David's Day. Once
upon a time (to use the old English Style) the Welsh Liberty lay grievously at
stake; and they must either be victorious, or lose it. In that Extremity they
called for help upon S. David, their Patron. Armed with Confidence in that
Saint, they crossed Fields sowed with Leeks, before they came to engage; and,
for distinction sake, each Soldier took up a Leek. The Welsh got the Victory;
and, to perpetuate the Memory thereof, as well as out of respect to the Saint,
they made a Law amongst themselves, that on S. David's Day every Man should
wear a Leek about his Head. Which is religiously by them observed every Year;
the common people wearing but Garden Leeks, and the better sort wrought ones.
The King himself, out of Complacency to that People, wears one upon that Day.

The Scots, on their fide, wear a blue Cross on the forepart of their Hats
upon S. Andrew's Day, their Patron. And the Irish a red Cross on one side of
their Hats, to the Memory of their old Patron, S. Patrick.

CHAP. IV.
I. Of the English Way of Traveling by Land, either Horseback, or in Coaches.

II. Of the general Post, for Intercourse of Letters.

III. Of the English Coins, Weights and Measures, in relation to Trade.

IV. Of the great Trade of England, in foreign Parts.

BEsides the Convenience of Traveling by Water, either by Sea, or here and
there upon Rivers, I may say the English Nation is the best provided of any for
Land-Travel, as to Horses and Coaches. And the Truth is, there is not perhaps a
Country so proper for it, it is generally so open and level.

Traveling on Horseback is so common a Thing in England, that the meanest sort
of People use it as well as the rest. Which sometimes fills the Roads with
Riders, not without frequent Disputes about giving the way, which is unusual
beyond Sea. And, as English Horses are the best for Expedition, so it is rare
upon the Road to see an Englishman but upon the Gallop.

But for Persons that are tender, or disabled, England excels all other Nations
in the Convenience of Coaches, but especially in that of Stage-Coaches; a very
commodious and easy Way of Traveling. Here one may be transported without
over-violent Motion, and sheltered from the Injuries of the Air, to most noted
Places in England. With so much speed, that some of these Coaches will reach
above 50 Miles in a Summer Day; and at so easy Rates, that it is in some Places
less than a Shilling for every Five Miles.

As to the Post, for Intercourse of Letters, there is a general Office in the
City of London, from whence Letters and Pacquets are dispatched to all Parts,
and the Returns according to their respective Directions.

This Office, now in Lombard Street London, is managed in chief by the
Postmaster General, who is constituted thereto by the King's Letters Patents
under the Great Seal of England, whose Place is counted to be worth 2000 l. a
Year. Under him he has a Deputy, and other Officers to a great Number, who give
their actual attendance respectively in the Dispatch of Business.

Upon this General Post Office depends 182 Deputy Post-Masters in England and
Scotland; most of which keep regular Offices in their Stages, and Sub-Post
Masters in their Branches. So that there is no considerable Market Town but has
an easy and certain. Conveyance for Letters to and from the said Post Office in
the due Course of the Mails every Post.

There are Weekly three general Post Days to send from London to any Part of
England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, viz. Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
The Returns certain upon Mundays, Wednesdays, or Fridays; except Ireland, from
whence the Return is not so certain, by reason of the Sea.

As to Kent and the Downs, the Post goes thither from London every Day of the
Week, except Sundays.

The Post Days fixed for France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, are Mundays and
Thursdays.

For the Low Countries, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and other Parts that way,
Tuesdays and Fridays.

But, since our late Breach with France, his Majesty to out off all immediate
Correspondency with that Kingdom, has settled the Correspondency with Spain and
Portugal by Sea, from Falmouth i^ Cornwall, to the Groyn a Seaport Town of
Gallicia in Spain. And the Letters to Italy go by the way of Flanders.

For the Transports of Letters and Pacquets over Sea, there are Between England
and Flanders, 2 Packet, Boats. Between England and Holland, 3 Packet, Boats.
Between England and Ireland, 3 Packet, Boats. Between England and Spain, 2
Packet, Boats.


The last of which goes out on Tuesdays every Fortnight.

All which Offices, Post-Masters, and Pacque^ Boats are maintained at the
Postmaster General's own Charge.

For the better Ordering whereof, he has several Officers under him, amongst
which these are the chief, viz. two Comptrollers, one of the Inland, and the
other of the Outland Office, (...) Receiver General, an Accomptant General, a^
twelve Clerks, whereof six of the Inland, a^ the other six of the Outland
Office.

Now for the Convenience of the Londoners that live far from the Post Office,
there are particular Post-Houses from Place to Place appointed to take in the
Letters, to be transmitted from thence in due time to the General Post Office.

By what is said, it may easily be guessed in general, that the Charge of the
Post Office is infinitely great. But the Return of it to the King does so much
overbalance it, that this Office yields to his Majesty yearly about Fifty
thousand pounds, all Charges born.

Another Use of this excellent Convenience is in relation to Travelers, whose
Business requires expedition. To which purpose there are always Posthorses in
readiness in every Post-Stage, which is the main Profit of the Deputy
Post-Masters. The Pay is 3 pence for every English Mile, besides the Allowance
to the Post-Boy for Conducting.

As for the Peny-Post, which is used only for London and its Neighborhood, I
have already spoke of it in my Description of London. And so I proceed to the
Coyns.

Formerly all English Coyns were coined or stamped by Hammers; but, since the
Restoration of King Charles II, a new Way of Stamping by a Mill or Screw was
found out, and followed ever since. Which makes the English Coyns, for neatness
and security from Counerseiting to be the most excellent.

The Money of England is either Gold or Sil^er, called Sterling Money. The Gold
is either Guinea, or a half Guinea; the first valued at (...) Shillings, and
six pence, the half Guinea pro^rtionably, that is, at Ten shillings nine pence.
^lled Guinea, from a Country of that Name in Africa, from whence is brought the
Gold whereof this Coin is made.

But there is besides, an old sort of Goid, called Jacobus, from King James I.
under whose Reign it was Coined, at the value of 22 shillings, now current at
25 shillings 6 pence. Another Coin, called Broad-piece, coined in the several
Reigns of King James and King Charles I, at the value of 20 Shillings, and now
current at 23 and 6 pence. But the Broad-pieces and Jacobus's, being both a
pure sort of Gold, are kept close by the Curious, and therefore seldom seen
abroad.

The Silver Coyns now current in England are a Crown, Half-crown, Shilling,
Sixpence, Fourpence, Threepence, Twopence, and One Penny. Amongst which the
Half-crowns, Shillings, and Six-pences are the most common.

It Is true there are still besides some Ninepences, and Four-pence half peny's;
also, some pieces of Thirteen-pence-half-peny, and others half their value. But
these are at this time very scarce.

For the Convenience of small Change, and the Benefit of the Poor, Farthings
and Halfpence, first of Copper, and lately of Tin, have been suffered to be
Coined; but no man is bound to receive them in pay for Rent or Debt.

But, besides the Species, we have (as other Nations) such Collective Words as
fignify a Sum, greater or lesser. As the Word Piece for 20 Shillings; Pounds,
when the Sum amounts to 60 Shilling, and above; a Mark, whch is 13 Shillings 4
pence; an Angel, 10 Shillings; a Noble, 6 Shillings 8 Pence. It Is true there
are Angels to be seen in Specie, which is a piece (...) Gold so called from the
Impression of an Angel. But the proper Use of it has been, in former Reigns,
for such as the King touched for the Evil.

The Spanish, French, and Flemish Gold is almost of equal fineness with the
English; and so is the French Silver almost as fine as the English.

The Office of the Mint, where all English Coyns are coined, is kept in the
Tower of London. And the Officers that belong to it were made a Corporation by
King Edward III, by virtue of whose Charter they have been always exempted from
all public Offices, and their Estates free from all Taxes and Parish Duties.

The chief Mint Officers are l. The Warden, Whose Fee is 400. The Master and
Worker, Whose Fee is 500. The Comptroller, Whose Fee is 300. The Assay-Master,
Whose Fee is 250. The Two Auditors, each Whose Fee is 20. The Surveyor of the
Melting, Whose Fee is 100. The Weigher and Teller, Whose Fee is 100. The His
Assistant, Whose Fee is 40. The Engineer, Whose Fee is 100. The Two Gravers,
each Whose Fee is 125.

The Warden, or Keeper of the Mint, receives the Gold and Silver brought in by
the Merchants, Goldsmiths, and others, and pays them for the same. He is the
chief Officer, and oversees all the rest.

The Master and Worker receives the Bullion, (that is, the Gold and Silver to
be coined) from the Warden, causes it to be melted, delivers it to the
Moneyers, and when it is Minted, receives it again from them.

The Comptroller's Office is to see, that the Money be all made according to
just Assize, and to comptroll the Officers, if it don't prove accordingly.

The Assay-Master weighs the Bullion, and sees that it be according to the
Standard.

The Auditors take and make up the Accounts.

The Surveyor of the Melting sees the Bullion cast, after the Assay-Master has
made trial thereof; and that it be not altered, after it is delivered to the
Melter

But, besides the foresaid Officers, there is the Provost of the Company of
Moneyers, the King's chief Clerk, and four other Clerks for the Receipt Office,
the Melters and Smiths, the Blanchers, Moulders, Laborers, etc.

The Weights and Measures ought to be by Magna Charta, the same all over
England, that is, according to the King's Standard kept in the Exchequer by the
Clerk (or Comptroller) of the Market.

The Weights now used throughout all England are of two sorts, the one called
Troy-Weight, and the other Avoir du pois; the first containing 12 Ounces, and
the other 16 in the Pound. But then the Ounce Avoir du pois is lighter than the
Ounce Troy by almost a 12th part. For, whereas in Troy-Weight the Ounce
consists of 480 Grains, the Ounce Avoir du pois contains but 438 Grains.

By the Troy-Weight are weighed Pearls, precious-Stones, Gold, Silver, Bread,
all manner of Corn and Grain; and this Weight the Apothecaries do or ought to
use. By Avoir du pois are weighed all Grocery Ware, Flesh, Butter, Cheese,
Iron, Hemp, Flax, Tallow, Wax, Lead, Steel, and all things whereof comes Waste.
In consideration whereof 112 Pound Avoir du pois goes to a Hundred-Weight, and
proportionably 56 pound to half a Hundred, and 28 to a Quarter, or Tod. A Stone
amongst London Butchers makes 8 pounds of this Weight, but in the Country it is
for the most part 14.

In Troy-Weight 20 Grains make a Scruple, thus marked, 3 Scruples a Dram, 8
Drachms an Ounce, and 12 Ounces a Pound lb. In Avoir du pois Weight, 16 Drachms
make an Ounce, 16 Ounces a Pound, 28 Pound a Quarter, 4 Quarters a Hundred, and
20 Hundred a Tun.

In Troy Weight, 24 Grains of Wheat make a Peny-Weight Sterling, 20
Peny-Weights an Ounce, and 12 Ounces a Pound. And, when Wheat is at 5 Shillings
the Bushel, the Penny Wheaten Loaf is then by Statute to weigh 11 Ounces Troy,
and three half Penny White Loaves to weigh as much. But the Household Peny-Loaf
is to weigh 14 Troy Ounces, and two thirds.

As for the Weight called Venice-Ounce used here, as in other Countries by
Silk-men, there is no Standard of it, nor is it allowed by Law. This Ounce
being but 13 Penny Weight and 12 Grains, it falls out that 12 Ounces Venice is
but 8 Ounces 4 penny Troy, and 9 Ounces Avoir du pois.

Measares are either Applicative, or Receptive, that is, such as Things are
measured by outwardly, or inwardly.

Of the first Sort, there is first an Inch, or fingers Breadth, 4 whereof make
a Hand-full, and 12 a Foot. Now 3 Foot makes a Yard, and one Yard and a quarter
an Ell. Five Foot makes a Geometrical Pace, 6 a Fadom, 16 and a half a Perch,
Pole, or Rod. Forty Perches make a Furlong, 8 Furlongs (or 320 Perches) an
English Mile, and 3 English Miles a French League, whereof 3 go to a Degree.
But this observe by the way, that by a Statute under the Reign of Henry VII, an
English Mile ought to be 1760 Yards, or 5280 Foot, that is 280 Foot more than
the Italian Mile.

Now an Acre of Land in England consists of 40 Perches in length, and 4 in
breadth; a Yard-Land, commonly of 30 Acres; and an Hide of Land of 100 Acres.

The Receptive Measure is twofold, that is, either for liquid, or dry Things.
For Liquid, as a Pint, which is subdivided into lesser Parts, as half a Pint, a
Quartern or quarter of a Pint. Now 2 Pints make a Quart, 2 Quarts a Pottle, 2
Pottles a Gallon, 8 Gallons a Firkin of Ale, and 9 a Firkin of Beer. Two
Firkins of either sort make a Kilderkin, and 2 Kilderkins a Barrel. But still
the Difference in the Number of Gallons as to Beer and Ale ought to be minded
and allowed. For, as a Kilderkin of Beer contains 18 Gallons, and one of Ale
but 16; so a Barrel of Beer being double a Kilderkin, contains 36 Gallons, and
one of Ale but 32.

Now a Barrel and a half of Beer (being 54 Gallons) make a Hogshead, 2
Hogshheads a Pipe or Butt, and 2 Pipes a Tun.

Note, that a Barrel of Butter or Soap is the same with a Barrel of Ale.

As for Wine-Measures, they fall so much short of those of Ale and Beer, that
Four Gallons of these make Five Gallous of Wine measure. Thus they hold
proportion as four to five. Of these Gallons a Rundlet of Wine holds 18, half a
Hogshead 31 and a half, a Tierce 42, a Hogshead 63, a Punchion 84, a Pipe or
Butt 126, a Tun 252.

For dry Things, such as Corn or Grain, there is first the Gallon, of a fize
between the Wine and the Beer Gallon. Two of these Gallons make a Peck, 4 Pecks
a Bushel, 4 Bushels a Comb or Curnock, 2 Curnocks a Quarter, 10 Quarters a Last
or Wey.

To conclude now with the Great Trade of England to Foreign Parts, besides the
several Companies I have took notice of in my Description of London, there are
other Companies or Societies of Merchants, established for the promoting or
encouraging of foreign Trade. Which have Power and Immunities granted them to
make Acts and Orders, for the benefit of Commerce in general, and of their
Companies in particular. Such are amongst others, the Company of Merchant
Adventurers, the Russia, Turkey, and East India Companies, and the Royal African
Company. Besides the Spanish, French, East-Land, and Greenland Companies, and
the Company trading to Hudson's Bay, the Privileges and Trade of which last
were lately confirmed by Act of Parliament.

The first being the Company of Merchant Adventurers, is the most ancient of
all, having had their Original in the Reign of Edward I, and their Continuance
ever since. Grounded at first upon the Exportation of Wool only, being the
prime and staple Commodity of England; since converted into Clothing, and now
including all manner of Drapery. This Company is managed in England by a
Governor, Deputy, and certain Assistants; beyond Sea, by a Deputy, and certain
Assistants.

The Russia Company had their Beginning in the Reign of Edward VI, upon the
Discovery made by the English of the North-East Passage to Archangel, whereby
they opened a great Trade in the Dominions of the ^zars of Moscovy, removed
hither from Narva upon the Baltic. Their Charter was afterward confirmed and
enlarged by Queen Elizabeth.

The Turky-Merchants, otherwise called the Levant Company, from their Trade in
the Levant, was Incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, and had their Charter
Confirmed and Enlarged by King James I.

But the greatest and most eminent Company is that which manages the East India
Trade, which begun likewise in Queen Elizabeth's Time, Anno 1600. For the
Managing whereof, they employ a joint Stock, and have a great House in
Leaden-Hall-Street, called the East India House. By which Trade and Stock they
have built a great Number of Warlike Ships, and brought hither those Indian
Commodities which before were brought to us by the Portugueze, being the first
Discoverers of the East India Passage.

So that by the East India and the Levant Companies, England, and many other
Countries by their second Transportation, have ever since been supplied with
those Rich Merchandises which Italy, Turkey, Arabia, Persia, India, and China
yield; where they have their respective Agents. On the Coast of Coromandel is
the Fort St. George, belonging to the East India Company, where they have a
President of all the Factories on that Coast, and of the Bay of Bengala.

As to the Royal African Company, King Charles II was pleased by his Letters
Patents, to grant them a Liberty of Trading all along the Western Coasts of
Africa, from Cape Vert as far as the Cape of good Hope, with prohibition of
Trading there to all his other Subjects. At Cape-Coast is the Residence of the
chief Agent of the Company, where they have a strong Place or Fort.

I pass by the other Companies, though some of them very considerable; and the
great Trade of the West Indies, generally managed by Merchants not
Incorporated. Only I shall add, that every Company has the Privilege to govern
themselves by settled Acts and Orders, under such Governors, Deputies,
Assistants, and Agents as they think fit to choose among themselves. And this
way has been found to be so profitable and beneficial, by Exporting the native
Commodities thereof, by setting the Poor on Work, by building of many brave
Ships, and by Importing hither of foreign Commodities both for Use and Ornament,
that the Benefit accruing thereby to these Nations cannot be expressed.

The principal Commodities exported from hence into foreign Countries are
Woollen Cloths of all sorts, broad and narrow, the English being now the best
Cloth-Workers in the World. To which add Sattins, Tabies, Velvets, Plushes, and
infinite other Manufactures; some of which make very good Returns from the
foreign Plantations.

Abundance of Tin, Lead, Alum, Copper, Iron, Fullers Earth, Salt, and Sea-Coal,
of most sorts of Grains, but Wheat especially, of Skins and Leather, of Trane
Oil and Tallow, Hops and Beer, Saffron and Licorish, besides great Plenty of
Seafish, is yearly transported over Sea to foreign Conntries.

From whence the Merchants make good Returns, and bring a great deal of
Treasure and rich Commodities, to the Enriching of themselves, the unspeakable
benefit of the Nation, and the Credit of the English in general. Who are as
industrious and active, as fair Dealers, and great Undertakers as any Nation in
the World.

For, though the Hollanders perhaps do drive a greater Trade, it is neither for
want of Stock, nor for want of Industry, on the side of the English. The
Hollanders, being squeezed as they are within the narrow Bounds of their
Country, find little or no Land to purchase, with the Returns of their Trade.
This puts 'em upon a kind of Necessity of improving still their Stock, and of
sending back those Riches a floating upon the Sea which they cannot fix on the
Land. Whereas our English Merchants having the Opportunity of Enjoying the
Fruits of their Industry, in a spacious, delicate, fruitful Country, by
purchasing Estates for themselves and Families, are apt to yield to the
Temptation, and to exchange the hurry of Trade for the pleasures of a
Country-life.

CHAP. V.
Of the English Laws, and Religion.

THE Laws of England are of several Sorts, and severally used according to the
Subject.

First there is the Common Law, that is, the Common Customs of the Nation,
which have by length of time obtained the force of Laws. This is the Summary of
the Laws of the Saxons and Danes, first reduced into one Body by King Edward
the Elder, about the Year 900. Which, for some time being lost, were revived by
King Edward the Confessor, and by Posterity named his Laws. To these William
the Conqueror having added some of the good Customs of Normandy, he caused
them all to be written in his own Norman Dialect; which, being no where
vulgarly used, varies no more than the Latin. Therefore to this day all
Reports, Pleadings, and Law-Exercises, Declarations upon Original Writs, and
all Records are written in the old Norman.

But where the Common Law falls short, the Statute Law makes it up. Which are
the Laws made from time to time by King and Parliament.

The Civil Law, which is counted the Law of Nations, is peculiarly made use of
in all Ecclesiastical Courts, in the Court of Admiralty, in That of the Earl
Marshal, in Treaties with foreign Princes, and lastly in the Two Universities of
the Land.

The Canon Law, otherwise called the Ecclesiastical Laws, takes place in Things
that merely relate to Religion. This Law comprehends the Canons of many ancient
General Councils, of many National and Provincial English Synods, diverse
Decrees of the Bishops of Rome, and Judgments of ancient Fathers, received by
the Church of England, and incorporated into the Body of the Canon Law. By
which she did ever proceed in the Exercise of her Jurisdiction, and does still
by virtue of an Act in the Reign of Henry VIII, so far as the said Canons and
Constitutions are not repugnant to the Holy Scripture, to the Kings
Prerogative, or the Laws of this Realm. But, whereas Temporal Laws inflict
Punishment upon the Body, these properly concern the Soul of Man. And, as they
differ in several Ends, so they differ in several Proceedings.

The Martial Law reaches none but Soldiers and Mariners, and is not to be used
but in time of actual War. But the late King, who ran headlong to Arbitrary
Power, made nothing of violating this, and most other Laws.

The Forest-Law concerns the Forests, and in flicts Punishment on those that
trespass upon them. By virtue of this Law, the Will is reputed for the Fact; so
that, if a Man be taken hunting a Deer, he may be Arrested as if he had taken
it.

Lastly, there are Municipal Laws, commonly called Peculiar (or By) Laws,
proper to Corporations. These are the Laws which the Magistrates of a Town or
City, by virtue of the King's Charter, have a Power to make for the benefit and
advantage of their Corporation; Provided always, that the same be not repugnant
to the Laws of the Land. These Bylaws properly bind none but the Inhabitants
of the Place, unless they be for public Good, or to avoid a public
Inconvenience. In which Case they bind Strangers.

Thus much in general as to the Laws of England. The chief Particulars will
come in of course, when I come to treat of the Government.

The Religion of England, as it is established by Law, is the best Reformed
Religion, and the most agreeable to the primitive Times of Christianity. But,
before I come to show the Occasion, Time, and Methods of its Reformation, it
will not be improper to give a brief historical Account how the Christian Faith
came to be planted in this Island, to set forth its Progress, Decay, and
Restoration; then its Corruption with Rome, and at last its Reformation.

That Christianity was planted here in the Apostles Times, long before King
Lucius, is plainly demonstrated by the Antiquity of the British Churches, writ
some Years since by Dr. Stillingfleet, the present Bishop of Worcester. Where
he learnedly disproves the Tradition concerning Joseph of Arimathea (supposed
by many to have been the first Planter of the Gospel here) as an Invention of
the Monks of Glassenbury, to serve their Interests, by advancing the Reputation
of their Monastery; and makes it highly probable, that S. Paul (rather than S.
Peter, as others would have it) was the first Founder of a Church in this
Island. But, by reason of Persecutions, or for want of a supply of Preachers,
Christianity did not flourish here till the Reign of Lucius the British King,
and the first Christian King in Europe. Of whose embracing Christianity the
learned Bishop gives this Account from the Testimony of ancient Writers, that
the was first inclined thereto by the Persuasion of Eluanus and Eduinus, two
British Christians, who were probably employed to convince him. But, being
workt upon on the other side by his Druids, he would not come to any
Resolution, till he had sent to Rome for his further Satisfaction, and to know
how far the British Christians and those of Rome agreed. Elentherus was then
Bishop of Rome, and the twelfth from the Apostles. To whom he sent the foresaid
Eluanus and Meduinus about the Year 180, presuming (as he might reasonably
then) that the Christian Doctrine was there truly taught, at so little distance
from the Apostles, and in a Place whither a Resort was made from all Parts,
because of its being the Imperial City. For there was then no Imagination of S.
Peter's having appointed the Head of the Church there, nor a long time after in
the British Churches, as appears by the Contest of the British Bishops with
Augustine the Monk.

King Lucius, being satisfied upon the Return of his Ambassadors from Rome,
embraced the Christian Faith, and received the Baptism. So that by the piety of
his Example, and the diligence of the first Preachers, Christianity soon spread
over his Dominions, and sometime after over all the Island. And then the
Britains had Bishops of their own, without any Juridical Dependency from the Sea of Rome, the British Church continuing a distinct and independent Church
from all others.

But, when the Heathen Saxons came to be possessed of this Part of the Island,
and the Natives forced to take shelter amongst the Mountains of Wales, the
Christian Faith fled with them, and this Country was again darkened with
Heathenism. Till about the Year 596. Austin the Monk was sent by Pope Gregory
the Great, to preach the Gospel here. By whose Diligence and Zeal the Work
prospered so well, that all the Saxons were by degrees converted to the
Christian Faith, and Austin made the first Arcsh-bishop of Canterbury, but with
a subjection to the Church of Rome. Thus, as the Errors crept on in the Roman,
the British Church grew infected with them, and continued subject to the Power
and Errors of Rome, till King Henry VIII laid the Ground for a Reformation, by
his resuming the Power of the Christian British Kings his ancient Predecessors,
and removing by virtue of it the forfeited Primacy of Rome to the Sea of
Canterbury. But it is Observable withal, that this Ejection of the Pope's
Authority was not done (as in other Nations) tumultuously, and by the Power of
the People, but by the Counsel and Advice of godly and learned Divines
assembled in Convocation by the King's Authority, and ratified by the Three
States in Parliament.

Thus the ancient Dignity and Supremacy of the Kings of England being restored,
and the Subjects delivered from the Spiritual Tyranny of the Pope of Rome, the
King and Clergy took this Occasion to inquire into and reform the great Abuses
and Errors crept into the Church. Whose Method in this Work (begun in Henry's
Reign, and brought to perfection in his next Successor's Time) Dr. Heylin sets
forth in these Words. The Architects, says he, in this great Work, without
respect unto the Dictates of Luther or Calvin, looking only on God's Word and
the Primitive Patterns, abolished such Things as were repugnant unto either,
but still retained such Ceremonies in God's public Worship as were agreeable
to both, and had been countenanced by the Practice of the Primitive Times. A
Point wherein they did observe a greater Measure of Christian Prudence and
Moderation, than their Neighbor Churches, Which in a mere detestation of the Sea of Rome, allowed of nothing which had formerly been in use amongst them,
because defiled with Popish Errors and Abuses; utterly averting thereby those
of the Papal Party from joining with them in the Work, or coming over to them
when the Work was done. Whereas, had they continued an allowable Correspondency
in these Extrinsecals of Religion with the Church of Rome, their Party in the
World had been far greater, and not so much stomached as it is. And this
Opinion of his he backs with the Sentiment of the Marquess de Rhosne in this
point, after Duke of Sully, and Lord High Treasurer of France, one of the chief
Men of the Reformed Party there. Who, being sent Ambassador to King James from
Henry IV. King of France, admired the Decency of Gods public Service in the
Church of England.

Three Things principally are to be considered in point of Religion, viz. The
Doctrine, the Manner of public Worship, and the Church Government.

As for the Doctrine of the Church of England, it is the same in all Points with
other Reformed Churches, as it appears by her Confession of Faith contained in
the 39 Articles. The Manner of public Worship differs in nothing from them,
but in the Excellency of it. So many admirable Prayers the English Liturgy
contains, suitable to all Occasions, digested in a plain Evangelical Style,
without Rhetorical Raptures, which are fitter for a designing Orator than an
humble Addresser to the Mercy-Seat of God. In short, there is nothing wanting
in the Church of England, in order to Salvation. She uses the Word of God, the
Ten Commandments, the Faith of the Apostles, the Creeds of the Primitive
Church, the Articles of the four first General Councils, an excellent Liturgy,
the Administration of the Sacraments, and all the Precepts and Counsels of the
Gospel. She attributes all Glory to God, worships his most holy Name, and owns
all his Attributes. She adores the Trinity in Unity, the Unity in Trinity. She
teaches Faith and Repentance, the Necessity of good Works, the strictness of a
holy Life, and an humble Obedience to the Supreme Power. Charity, which is the
grand Mark of the true Church, is so essential to this, that she does not
ingross Heaven to her self, so as to damn all others into Hell. For the public
Service and Worship of God she has Places, Times, Persons, and Revenues set
apart for that purpose; and an uninterrupted Succession of Bishops, to ordain
Priests and Deacons, and do all other Duties iucumbent to that Dignity.

Happy were it for England, if all its Subjects would live in the Communion of
this Church, and not separate from it; which is (...) Thing more to be wished,
than hoped for. But such is the designing and ambitious Spirit of Popery, to
weaken the Church of England (ever since the Reformation looked upon as the
chiefest Bulwark against Popery) that it has caused all our Distractions, in
order to fish the better in troubled Waters. Yet whatever have been the Effects
of it hitherto, God has wonderfully defeated their Designs. Insomuch that this
Church, formerly scattered and eclipsed in the Reign of Charles I, restored
(but afterward undermined) by Charles II, and lately threatened with utter Ruin
by his immediate Successor, is now, by the special Providence of God, in a
Hourishing Condition, under the happy Influence of our present King William,
the Restorer of our Laws, Religion, and Liberties.

As for the Spirit of Persecution which the Church of England has been charged
with in relation to Dissenters, it cannot be justly laid to her Charge. For
whatever has been done in that Case was but according to Law, and the Penal
Laws were made (as all Statute-Laws) in a regular Manner by the Votes of
Parliament, the Representatives of the People, as well Dissenters as others.
It Is true, the Church-Party proved the most predominant. And yet, in point of
Execution, the sober part of the Church were always very tender, and none but
hot Men amongst them ready for Execution. Influenced thereto by the Court;
which, far from designing the Dissenters Union with the Church, used the Rigor
of the Law, to create an implacable Hatred betwixt the afflicting Church and
the suffering Body of the Dissenters. Which had a suitable Effect. For these,
imbittered what with Fines, what with Imprisonments, tho according to Law,
failed not to clamor on all sides against the persecuting Spirit of the Church
of England, and against those bloody Laws, as they used to call 'em. The Sense
of their present state made them forget what they had done, when they usurped
the Regal Power; and how busy they were to imprison, to banish, to sequester.
With Grief I rake up these old Sores, and nothing but a just Desire of righting
both Parties could have extorted this from me.

But now the Dissenters have got Liberty of Conscience by a late Act of
Parliament, with the ready Concurrence of the Church-Party in both Houses, I
hope there is no Ground left for Animosities between the Church and Them. And,
if the Presbyterians, who are the nearest to the Church of England, and the
greatest Party among Dissenters, now they have seen so much of her incomparable
Learning, and invincible Stedfastness to the Protestant Religion and Interest,
would but shake off their groundless Prejudices, and prefer the happiness of a
Reunion before the Danger of a Schism, what a Blessing it would prove to this
Nation is almost unconceivable. It Is not long since the Church was their
Sanctuary, when they expected no Mercy from a late King, who came to the
Throne, full of Resentment and Indignation against them. Tho afterward, to
compass his own Ends, he tacked about, and killed them almost with Kindness.
And why they should now separate from a Church, which was so lately their
Refuge, when they crowded the very Churchmen out of Church, it is past my
Understanding. For the Church of England is the same still. Were they but so
well-minded as to make the least step toward a Reunion, I am assured the
Church of England would be very forward to meet them. Rather than they should
continue their Separation, and be Accountable to Gods Tribunal for it, I am
more than confident she would readily part with such Ceremonies as give 'em
most offense. But it is feared, they would not be satisfied with those small
Condescensions. They are for more substantial Things, which for Peace sake I
shall forbear to name, and leave for the Reader to guess.

The main Points wherein they differ from the Church of England is the Church
Government, and the public Worship. They hold, that the Church was governed in
the beginning by Presbyters or Elders, and that it should be so governed still,
not by Bishops; upon which account they got the Name of Presbyterians. They
except both against the latitude of the Bishops Power, and the largeness of
their Revenues, as if neither of them could be used by the Clergy with
Christian Moderation. But it is more probable, the unshaken fidelity of Bishops
to Monarchy which many of the Dissenters were never very fond of, sticks most
in their Stomach For public Worship they use no Liturgy wherein they differ
from the Protestan^ Churches, beyond Sea. They look upon Se^ Forms as dead
Prayers, and delight only o^ Extemporal. Therefore the Lord's Prayer i^ in a
manner exploded by the rigid Sort o^ them. Yet one would think when their
Minister prays before the Congregation, his Prayer ^s a set Form to such as
pray with him. The Surplice, the Sign of the Cross, the bowing ^t the Name of
Jesus, and the kneeling at the Communion, are to them so many Sins. They deal
plainly with God, at least in outward appearance; and are resolved, as far as
(...) see, to serve him without Ceremony. Great Predestinarians many of 'em
are, and very strict Observers of the Sabbath. In short, their apparent
Soberness in Conversation, and Zeal in their Devotion, has so increased their
Number, that they are looked upon as the chief Party amongst all the Dissenters.

Next to whom, both in their Opinions and Number, are the Independents, or
Congregationalists. So called, for that they will have every particular
Congregation to be ruled by their own Laws, without dependence upon any other
in Church Matters. For they prefer their own Gathered Churches in private
Places to the public Congregations in Churches, which in contempt they call by
the name of ^ceeple-Houses. In most Things else they ^^mp with the
Presbyterians. Except those particular Tenets some of 'em have intertain^d,
which for brevities sake I forbear to enumerate. The riged sort of 'em (called
Brownists) ^efuse to Communicate with any of the Reformed Churches.

The Anabaptists are so called from Rebapti^ing those who coming to their
Communion ^ere baptized in their Infancy. For one of their chief Tenets is
against Pedobaptism, or baptizing of Children. They hold besides, that
Lay People may preach. As for those blasphe^ous Opinions, their Forefathers
have been charged with, I hope few of the modern And baptists in England are
guilty of them.

The Millenarians, or Fifth-Monarchy-Men, are so called from their Expectation
of Christ's temporal Kingdom here on Earth for a thousand Years. And this they
ground upon several Places of Scripture, which from a Spiritual they wrest into
a Carnal Sense.

The Quakers are a sort of Enthusiasts; so called, because they use to quake
and groan, when they wait for the Spirit. Whereas the Spirit of God is a Spirit
of Peace and Quietness, not to be found in Fire, Earthquakes, and Whirl-winds,
but in the soft and still Voice. They reject all Ministerial Ordinances, and
rail against premeditated Preaching o^ Praying. The Holy Scripture is no Rule
for 'em to go by, but Inspiration and the Light they pretend to is all in all
with them. So that any Man or Woman in their Meetings that fancies first to be
seized with the Spirit, is free to stand up for a Teacher to the Congregation,
and utter what comes next. They use no Sacraments, and consequently they are
but half Christians. Their Principle is for Equality amongst Men, which of it
self tends to Anarchy. Therefore they show respect to no Man, tho they love it
well enough from Men of other Principles. They Thou all Men, Kings and Cobblers
alike, without any distinction, and pull off their Hats to none. They affect a
singular Plainness in their Speech, in their Garb, and in their Dealings. They
are for plain Yea and Nay; and not a word of an Oath, tho imposed by the
Magistrate. A Ribbon, a Loop, or a Lace, is a mortal Sin with them; and this
Plainness I should not much condemn, if Pride did not lurk under it. In their
Dealings, they have indeed got a good Name, and ^ hope it is not groundless;
though some unlucky men have endeavored to check it, by representing them as a
crafty and subtle Generation.

These are the principal Sects that are now (...) this Kingdom. Besides the
Roman Catholics, properly called Recusants, whose Number and interest is much
decayed since the Fall of King ^ames.

As for Ranters, Adamites, Familists, Antino^ians, Sweet-Singers,
Muggletonians, and I know not what else, as they suddenly sprung up like
^^shrooms, so they are in a manner dwindled unto nothing. And indeed their
Opinions were ^oo blasphemous and senseless, to hold out long ^ongst Men of any
Sense.

In Conclusion, it is observable how the Difference of Sentiments in Matters of
Religion ^^ters the very Temper of Men of the same ^lation; so that one would
think they don't ^reath the same Air, nor live in the same Cli^ate. The Church
of England Men, as sober ^^d reserved as they are, comparatively to a
^eighbouring Nation, yet they are far more ^ee, sociable, and open-hearted than
the ge^erality of the Dissenters; Who, looking upon ^emselves as the sober Part
of the Nation, (...) on a Countenance accordingly. I will not ^etch it so far as
to call it starched, stern, au^^re, and morose; but grave it is in the high^^
degree. If those in^line to Jollity, these ^e for Melancholy; If to
Prodigality, these ^e for Penuriousness. If some of them be ^ilty of
Libertinism, it is ten to one but some (...) these prove guilty of the opposite
Sin, which the fouler of the two, though the less contagious. Lastly, if the
Churchmen in their way of Dealing buy of all Men, without any distinction for
Conscience sake, these out of Brotherly kindness trade most amongst themselves.
So true it is, that the very outward Profession of Religion works upon the
inward Parts, either for better or for worse.

This Observation may be further Illustrated by the late Conduct of the French,
a Nation which for many Ages has been looked upon as a^ Pattern of Civility and
good Manners. To see how a false Notion of Religion has turned in that Kingdom
Men into very Brutes, and Genteelness into Barbarity, is almost past my
Understanding. The Popish Massacre of the French Protestants in the Reign of
Charles IX, as cruel and bloody as it was, was nothing to the late refined
Persecution. In that Massacre those that suffered were presently dispatched,
and rid of their Sufferings; but in this Persecution a present Death of the
Persecuted was a Penance to the Persecutor. For the Design of the Persecutors
was not to take away the Lives of Protestants, but all the Comforts of their
Lives by Want and barbarous Usage, spoiling an^ plundering, dark Prisons and
loathsome Du^geons, by parting the Husband and Wife, an^ robbing Parents of
their dearest Children. An^ all this to humor a fancy of a proud Monarch who
never knew much of any Religion; an^ yet would have all his Subjects to be of
hi^ by fair or foul means, right or wrong. When he thought he had pretty well
robbed h^^ Neighboring Princes, this Giant-lik^ Monarch made War with God
himself, and we^ about to undermine his Kingdom over Me^ Consciences.

I have but one Reflection more upon our se^eral Ways of Worship. Which is,
that the Dissenters serve God Slovenly, the Church of England Decently, and the
Papists Gaudily. Est in Medio Virtus.

CHAP. VI.
Of the English Government, in general.

ENGLAND, if we except the late distracted Times before the Restoration of
Charles II, has been always governed by Sovereign Princes. Before the Romans
came in, the Britains being divided into several Nations, each of them was
governed by its own Kings and particular Princes.

When Britain became a Member of the Roman Empire, then the Britains were under
the Roman Emperors. Yet so, that many of their Tribes had their own Kings, who
were suffered ^o govern by their own Law, but then they ^ere Tributary. Such
Kings were Codigunus ^^d Prasitagus mentioned by Tacitus, Lucius ^he first
Christian King, and Coilus the Father (...) Helena, Mother of Constantine the
Great. and it is observable, that the Policy of the Ro^ans in suffering Kings in
the Conquered Coun^ies, was to make them (as Tacitus says) Ser^tutis
Instrumenta, that is, instrumental to the ^oples Bondage.

After the Romans had quitted the Stage of Britain, upon the Irruption of the
Huns into Italy in the Empire of Honorius, (which happened in the Fifth Century)
the Kingly Government returned to the Britains. Who chose for their King
Constantine, Brother of Aldroinus, King of Britany in France, a Prince of the
British Blood. To whom succeeded Constantius his Son; then Vortiger, who
usurped the Crown, and to defend his Title against his Enemies first called in
the Saxons. These having got sure footing in this Kingdom, never left the
Britains quiet, till they were possessed of the Whole. And, though they were
overthrown in many Battles by King Vortimer, the Son and immediate Successor of
Vortiger, and afterward by King Arthur, One of the Worlds Nine Worthies, yet
the Britains were soon after his Death so broken and weakened, that they were
forced at last to yield, and to exchange this Part of Britain for the Mountains
of Wales.

Thus the Britains left the Stage, and the Saxons entered, but still with a
Regal Power. By these the Country was divided into Seven Kingdoms, the several
Names and Extent whereo^ you have in my First Part. But, for the further
satisfaction of the Reader, I shall he^^ subjoyn the Names of the first Kings,
with the Dates of their Accession to their respectiv^ Kingdoms.

The first King of Kent, Hengist 455. The first King of South Saxons, Ella,
488. The first King of West Saxons, Cerdic, 522. The first King of East Saxons,
Erchenwin, 527. The first King of East Angles, Offa, 575. The first King of
Northumberland, Ida, 549. The first King of Mercia, Criodda, 582.
This Heptarchy continued thus for several Ages separate and distinct, till the
prevailing Fortune of the West Saxons united them all into one, by the Name of
England. Which happened Anno 819, in the Reign of King Egbert, the last King of
the West Saxons, and the first of England. Who, having vanquished all the rest
of the Saxon Kings, and added most of their Estates to his own, caused the
whole united Body to be called Engel-lond, since turned into England, in a
Parliament (or Council) held at Winchester, in the Year aforesaid. And by that
Name he was then crowned in the presence of his Nobles, and the rest of his
Subjects. Though the Truth is, King Alfred, a Grandchild of Egbert, was he who
totally united the Saxon Heptarchy into one Estate.

Thus, from the Time of Egbert to this present Time, England has continued a
Monarchy above 870, Year. First, under 15 Kings of the Saxon Bace; then under 3
Danish Kings; and next to them, under Edward the Confessor, and Harold II, two
Kings of the Saxon Blood. Who were succeeded by four Norman Kings. And after
Stephen the last of the Four, the Saxon Blood was again restored in the Person
of King Henry II, Anno 1155, in whose Blood the Crown has continued ever since.

Now the English Monarchy is none of those Despotical Monarchies, where the
Subjects (like Slaves) are at the Arbitrary Power and Will of their Sovereign.
An unnatural sort of Government, and directly contrary to the true end of
Government, which is the Preservation, Welfare, and Happiness of the People.
And what Happiness can a People propose to themselves, when instead of being
protected, they may be plundered and murdered at the will of their Prince? Men
had as good live in a state of Anarchy, as ly at some Princes Mercy, whose
unlimited Power serves only to make them furious and outrageous. And where lies
the Advantage, when the King proves a cruel Tyrant, to be Robbed or Murdered by
a Royal, or a common Robber?

The Government of England, Thanks be to God, is better Constituted. It Is a
Monarchy, but not with that Dominion which a Master has over his Slave. For
then the King might lawfully sell all his Subjects, like so many Head of
Cattle, and make Money of his whole Stock when he pleases.

Here the Legislative Power is divided betwixt the King and his People, but the
Executive Power is lodged solely in the King. Here the King has his
Prerogative, which is the Support of the Crown; and the People their
Privileges, which assert their Liberty. If the King stretches his Prerogative
so far beyond its Bounds, as to overthrow the Liberty of the Subject, he
unhinges the Government; and the Government being dissolved, He and the Nation
are to seek as in the late King's Case. If any part of the Subjects incroach
upon his Prerogative, they undergo the lash of the Law; which is no less tender
of the Kings Prerogative, than of the Subjects Liberty.

But the Question is, in case of a Difference betwixt the King and his People,
who is a competent Judge.

To answer this Objection, I shall make use of the Inquiry into the Measures of
Submission to the Supreme Authority. It Is to be considered, says the Learned
and Judicious Author, that some Points are justly disputable and doubtful; and
others so manifest, that any Objections made against them are rather forced
Pretenses, than so much as plausible Colors. If the Case be doubtful, the
Interest of the public Peace and Order ought to carry it. But the Case is
quite different, when the Invasions that are made upon Liberty and Property,
are plain and visible to all that consider them.

But, upon such an Invasion, how can the Subjects of England take up Arms
against their King, when the Militia is by several express Laws lodged singly
in the King; and those Laws have been put in the form of an Oath, which all
that have born any Employment either in Church or State have sworn? So that,
though the Subjects have a Right to their Property by many positive Laws, yet
they seem now to have no Right or Means left to preserve it. And here seems to
be a Contradiction in the English Government; viz. a public Liberty challenged
by the Nation, and grounded upon Law, and yet a Renouncing of all Resistance,
when that Liberty is invaded, and that also grounded upon Law.

This is indeed the main Difficulty. But, in Answer to it, this we must take
for a general Rule, when there seems to be a Contradiction between two Articles
in the Constitution: That we ought to examine which of the two is the most
evident, and the most important, and so fix upon it; then we must give such an
accommodating sense to that which seems to contradict it, that so we may
reconcile 'em together. It Is plain, that our Liberty is only a Thing that we
enjoy at the Kings Discretion and during his Pleasure, if the other against all
Resistance is to be understood according to the utmost extent of the Words.
Therefore, since the chief Design of our whole Law, and of all the several
Rules of our Constitution, is to secure and maintain our Liberty, we ought to
lay that down for a Conclusion, that it is both the most plain, and the most
important of the two. And the other Article against Resistance ought to be so
softened, as that it do not destroy us.

If the Law never designed to lodge the Legislative Power in the King, as it is
self-evident, it is plain it did not intend to secure him in it, in case he
should go about to assume it. Therefore the not resisting the King can only be
applied to the Executive Power, that so, upon no pretense of ill
Administrations in the Execution of the Law, it should be lawful to resist him.
Another Proof that the Law only designed to secure the King in the Executive
Power, is the Words of the Oath, which makes it unlawful to bear Arms against
the King, or any Commissionated by him. For, if the Commission be not according
to Law, it is no Commission; and consequently those who act by virtue of it, are
not Commissionated by the King in the sense of the Law.

Besides, all general Words, how comprehensive soever, are still supposed to
have a tacit Exception and Reserve in them, if the matter seem to require it.
Thus Children are commanded to obey their Parents in all Things; and Wives are
declared by the Scripture to be subject to their Husbands in all Things, as the
Church is unto Christ. For odious Things ought not to be suspected, and
therefore not named upon such Occasions; but when they fall out, they carry
still their own force with them. So by our Form of Marriage, the Parties swear
to one another, till Death them do part; and yet few doubt but that this Bond
is dissolved by Adultery, though it is not named.

In short, when a King of England strikes at the very Foundations of the
Government, as the late King did, and that his Maleversations are not only the
effect of Humane Frailty, of Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or Passions, to which
all Princes may be subject, as well as other Men, in such Cases that King may
fall from his Power, or at least from the Exercise of it, and such his Attempts
(in the very Judgment of the greatest Assertors of Monarchy,) naturally divest
him of his whole Authority. To this purpose we have still fresh before us the
Example of the late King of Portugal, who for a few Acts of Rage fatal to very
few Persons, was put under a Guardianship, and kept a Prisoner till he died,
and his Brother the present King made Regent in his place. Which it seems was
(at least secretly) approved by most of the Crowned Heads of Europe, and even
our Court gave the first Countenance to it. Though of all others, King Charles
II. had the least Reason to do it, since it justified a Younger Brother's
supplanting the Elder. But the Evidence of the Thing carried it even against
Interest.

These are my Authors Arguments, which I thought fit to insist upon, to justify
the Nations taking up Arms for the Defense of their Laws, Religion, and
Property, against the late King's actual and barefaced Subverting the whole
Frame of this most happy and blessed Government.

A Government which has made many Kings glorious beyond the Great Nimrod of
France, and their People happy beyond all other Nations. A Government which
allows enough to a King that cares not to be a Tyrant, and enough to the People
to keep them from Slavery. When the King's Prerogative does not interfere with
the Liberty of the People, or the Peoples Liberty with the Kings Prerogative,
that is, when both King and People keep within their own Sphere, there is no
better framed Government under the Sun. Here is Monarchy without Slavery; a
great King, and yet a free People. And, the Legislative-Power being lodged in
the King, Lords, and Commons jointly, it is such a Monarchy as has the main
Advantages of an Aristocracy in the Lords, and of a Democracy in the Commons,
without the Disadvantages or Evils of either.

The Government of England being thus constitued, I see no Ground there is for
passive Obedience, where the Kings Commands are visibly contrary to Law, and
destructive of the Constitution.

The Measures of Power, and consequently of Obedience, must be taken from the
express Laws of the State, or from Immemorial Customs, or from particular Oaths
which the Subjects swear to their Princes. And, in all Disputes between Power
and Liberty, Power must always be proved, for Liberty proves it self; that
being founded only upon a Positive Law, this upon the Law of Nature.

Now it is plain, the Law of Nature has put no Difference (or Subordination)
amongst Men, except it be that of Children to their Parents, or of Wives to
their Husbands. So that, with relation to the Law of Nature, all Men are born
Free; and this Liberty must be still supposed entire, unless so far as it is
limited by Contracts, Provisions, and Laws.

And, as a private Person can bind himself to another Man by different Degrees,
either as a common Servant for Wages, or as an Apprentice appropriate for a
longer Time, or as a Slave by a total giving himself up to another; so may
several Bodies of Men give themselves upon different Terms and Degrees to the
Conduct of others. And, as in those Cases the general Name of Master may be
equally used, tho the degrees of his Power are to be judged by the nature of
the Contract; so in these all may carry the same Name of King, and yet every
ones Power is to be taken from the Measures of that Authority which is lodged
in him, and not from any general Speculations founded on some equivocal Terms,
such as King, Sovereign, or Supreme.

But this has been of late so learnedly argued, that I shall wave any further
Discussion of this Matter. This only I shall add, that the King of England is,
by the moderate Assertors of this Monarchy, called Pater Patriae, and Sponsus
Regni. By which Metaphorical Characters the King and his Subjects come within
the Relation of a Father and Children, or within that of a Husband and Wife;
which is proper enough to represent the Nature and Mildness of the English
Government. Others make King and Subject to be no other Relation than that of
Guardian and Ward. Ad tutelam namque (says Fortescue) Legis Subditorum, ac eorum
Corporum and Bonorum, Rex hujusmodi erectus est; the King being ordained for
the Defense or Gardianship of the Laws of his Subjects, and of their Bodies and
Goods.

I have done, and now I proceed to a further Description of this Monarchy. It Is
Free and Independent, that is, not holden of any Earthly Potentate, or any ways
obliged to do Homage for the same; as the Kingdom of Naples, holden of the Pope
by the King of Spain, and that of Scotlund which held in Capite of the Crown of
England. Whereas the Kingdom of England owns no Superior upon Earth.

A Monarchy that justly challenges a Freedom from all Subjection to the
Emperor, or Laws of the Empire. For, tho the Roman Emperors were anciently
possessed of this Country, and got by force of Arms the Possession of it; yet,
upon their quitting the same, the Right (by the Law of Nations) returned to the
former Owners pro Derelicto, as the Civilians speak.

The same is also free from all manner of Subjection to the Pope of Rome, and
consequently from those several Inconveniences and Burdens which ly upon
Popish Kingdoms. As Taxes paid to that Bishop, Provisions and Dispensations in
several Cases to be procured from the Court of Rome, and Appeals thither in
Ecclesiastical Suits.

It Is an Hereditary Monarchy, and such as allow's of no Interregnum; free
therefore from those Mischiefs and Inconveniences which frequently attend such
Kingdoms as are Elective. Though it is granted, at least it seems apparent by
History, that England has been an Elective Kingdom, especially in the Time of
the Saxons; When, upon the King's Death, those Persons of the Realm that
composed the then Parliament assembled, in order to the choosing of another.
And, tho one or other of the Royal Blood was always chosen, yet the next in
lineal Succession was often set aside, as is evident from the Genealogies of
the Saxon Kings. But, however it was in those and after Times, certain it is
that ever since King Henry VII. the Crown has run in a course of lineal
Succession by Right of Inheritance. Till the late King, having forsaken the
Government and abdicated the Kingdom, the Crown (with the general Consent of
the Nation) was set upon the Head of the Prince of Orange (our present King)
jointly with the Princess the next Heir to King James, and the Succession
settled as will appear afterward. And upon William and Mary, our Gracious King
and Queen, may the Crown long flourish.

To conclude, whatever be the Bent and Inclination of some Men amongst us for a
Commonwealth, the Generality of the Nation is so much for Monarchy, that it is
like so to continue as long as the World indures. In that Eclipse of Monarchy
which happened before the Restoration of King Charles II, how busy then the
Commonwealth Party was to provide against its Return, and to settle here
Democracy for ever, all the World know's. No Stone was left unturned, and what
came of it? As soon as ever Opportunity served, the very Presbyterians
themselves joined with the Royalists to bring in the exiled King, and
reestablish the ancient Government. So soon the Nation grew sick of the
Commonwealth, and so strong was then the Current for Monarchy, that, without
the shedding of a drop of Blood, the first was in a manner hissed out of the
Nation, and Monarchy restored with the greatest Pomp and Joy imaginable.

I set aside the Zeal of our English Clergy for Monarchy, and their Influence
upon the Laity. The great Number alone of our Nobility and Gentry, with their
proportionable Ascendent upon the People, makes me look upon it as a moral
Impossibility for Commonwealth-Government ever to prevail here. It Is well
known, the Genius of Commonwealths is for keeping down the Nobility, and
extinguishing all those Beams of Royalty. Therefore as it is their Interest, so
I suppose it will be their Care, to stick to Monarchy.

CHAP. VII.
Of the KING of ENGLAND. And first of his Dominions, Titles, Arms, his Ensigns
of Royalty, and Marks of Sovereignty.

THE King of England is otherwise called King of Great Britain, as being the
sole Sovereign and supreme Head of this great and famous Island, containing the
two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, besides the Principality of Wales.

Which Principality was first united, by Conquest, to the Crown of England Anno
1282, by King Edward I. Who overcame and slew in Battle Llewellen, the last
Sovereign Prince of Wales, of the Race of Cadwallader the last King of the
Britains. After the Conquest thereof, he took all the provident Care imaginable
to secure it to the Crown; but the Welsh seldom contained themselves within the
bounds of true Allegiance, till the Reign of Henry VII, who was extracted from
the Welsh Blood. In whose Successor's Reign, Henry VIII, they were made by Act
of Parliament one Nation with the English, subject to the same Laws, capable of
the same Preferments, privileged with the same Immunities, and enabled to send
Knights and Burgesses to the English Parliament. So that the Name and Language
only excepted, there is now no Difference between the English and Welsh. A very
happy Union.

Scotland was also brought into Subjection by the same King Edward; so that he
received Homage of its King and Nobility, and had there his Chancery and other
Courts under a Viceroy. But with much struggling they recovered at last their
Liberty, and set up a King of their own, Robert Bruce; who had the luck to be
confirmed in it by the Defeat given to Edward II, one of our unfortunate Kings.
It Is true his Son King Edward III, a most virtuous and valorous Prince, changed
the face of Affairs in Scotland, and brought again the Scots to Obedience.
Insomuch that he excluded David, the Son of Robert Bruce from the Crown, then
forced to fly into France, and restored the House of Baliol to the Kingdom, in
the person of Edward Son of King John Baliol. Who, upon his coming to the
Crown, did Homage to this King Edward, as his Father had done to King Edward I.
But 'twas not long before the Scots quitted again their Subjection and
Vassalage to the Crown of England, the Roll of Ragman being treacherously
delivered into their hands by Roger Mortimer Earl of March. Which Roll
contained a Confession and Acknowledgement of the Estates of Scotland,
subscribed by all their Hands and Seals; whereby they owned the Superiority of
the Kings of England, not only in regard of such Advantages as the Sword had
given them, but as of their original and undoubted Right.

But, setting aside this point of Vassalage, the Kings of England are Kings of
Scotland by a better Title. For King James VI of Scotland, and the first of
England, succeeded Q. Elizabeth in the Realm of England, as the next Heir to
the Crown, Anno 1602; being descended, by Mary Queen of the Scots his Mother,
from Margaret, the eldest Daughter of Henry the VII. King of England, and Wife
to James IV, of Scotland. And here the Wisdom and prudent Foresight of Henry is
very remarkable. Who, having two Daughters, bestowed the Eldest (contrary to
the Mind of his Council) on the King of Scots, and the younger on the French
King; that, if his own Issue Male should fail, as it did by the Death of his
Grandson King Edward VI, and that a Prince of another Nation must inherit
England, then Scotland as the lesser Kingdom, should depend upon England, and
not England wait on France, as upon the greater. In which Succession of the
Scots to the Crown of England, the Prophecy of the fatal Stone received
accomplishment. I mean the Stone which the Scots looked upon as their Palladium,
kept at Scone in Scotland, the usual Place for the Coronation of the Scottish
Kings; upon which they received their Crown, till the Removal of it unto
Westminster by King Edward I. The Verses of old engraven upon this Stone run
thus, Non fallat Fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum,
Invenient Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.


Translated in old Meeter thus. The Scots shall brook that Realm as natif
Ground,
If Weirds fail not, where ere this Stone is found.


Thus the Scots, so often quelled and curbed by the English, never subdued
England but by this blessed Victory.

Ever since this happy Union, Scotland has been deprived of its Kings Residence
there, who changed the worse Seat for the better. But under the King there is a
chief Governor appointed by his Majesty, the Lord High Commissioner of
Scotland; who, by that Title, injoys the ordinary Power and Authority of a
Viceroy. In this manner Scotland has continued to this day a separate Kingdom,
governed by its own Laws. It Is true there have been several Attempts made to
unite it into one Kingdom with England, as Wales was by Henry VIII. But
hitherto they proved unsuccesfull.

So far we have cleared in few Words by History the whole Isle of Great Britain
to the King of England; with the numerous Islands about it, the principal of
which are the Isles of Shepey, Thanet, Wight, Anglesey, and Man.

The next that offers it self is the Kingdom of Ireland, a great Part whereof
was Conquered by the English about the Year 1172. in the Reign of Henry II, and
the Occasion thus. Ireland being then divided amongst several ^petty Kings, the
King of Leinster was by the King of Mead driven out of his Kindom. He fled to
England for Refuge; where, applying himself to King Henry, Henry resolved to
attempt his Restoration; which he did effectually, and in the doing of it,
brought the best part of the Island under the English Subjection. King John,
the Younger Son of Henry, was the first who was Entitled Lord of Ireland.
Which Style was granted him by Pope Urban III, and continued to his Successors
(though in effect Kings thereof) till the Year 1542; when Henry VIII, was
declared in an Irish Parliament King of Ireland, as a Name more sacred and
replete with Majesty. But the English never made a full and entire Conquest of
that Kingdom till the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, upon the great
Defection of the Irish. Which ended in a total Overthrow of the Rebels, then
under the Conduct of Hugh O Neal, Earl of Tiroen; and the consequence of it,
according to the Rule, That every Rebellion, when it is suppressed, does make
the Prince stronger, and the Subjects weaker: Which I hope will be the effect
of the present Rebellion in that Kingdom.

But, besides Great Britain and Ireland, the King of England is possessed of
Jersey, Garnsey, Alderney, and Sark, four Islands of good note (especially the
two first) on the Coast of Normandy in France. The same are holden in right of
that Dukedom, which was Conquered by Henry I, of England, and continued English
till the Days of King John; when Philip II, of France, surnamed Augustus,
seized on all the Estates the English had in France, as Forfeitures, Anno 1202.
And, since the French seized upon Normandy, they have often attempted Jersey,
and Garnsey, but always with repulse and loss. So affectionate are the People
to the English Government, and jealous of the Privileges they enjoy under it,
which they could not hope for from the French.

In America the King of England is possessed of New England, Virginia,
Maryland, New York, Pensylvania, Carolina, and Hudsons-Bay. Besides many noted
Islands, as Newfound Land, Jamaica, Bermudos, Barbados; and, amongst the
Leeward Islands, Nevis, Antego, Montserat, Anguilla, etc.

In Asia he has the Isle of Bombay near Goa, which was Part of the present
Queen Dowagers Portion; besides Conveniences for Traffic in India, China, and
the Levant. The same he has upon the Coast of Africa.

The King of England has a Claim besides to the Sovereignty of all the Seas
round about Great Britain and Ireland, and all the Isles adjacent, even to the
Shores of all the Neighboring Nations. Therefore all Foreiners Ships have
anciently demanded Leave to Fish, and to pass in these Seas; and to this day
lower their Topsails to all the Kings Ships of War. Our Law faith, the Sea is
of the Liegeance of the King, as well as the Land. And accordingly Children
born upon our four Seas (as sometimes it does happen) are accounted natural
born Subjects of the King of England, without being naturalized.

The King of England has moreover a Title to the Kingdom of France. First
Challenged by King Edward III, as Son and Heir of Isabel, the Daughter of King
Philip the Fair, and Sister of Lewis IX, Philip V, and Charles the Fair, who
reigned successively, and died without Issue Male. To prosecute which Title, he
entered into France with an Army, took upon him the Title of King of France, and
caused the Flower de luces to be quartered with the Lions of England; which has
been continued ever since amongst all his Successors. The French (opposing his
Title by virtue of a pretended Salique Law, disabling Women from the Succession
to the Crown) he overthrew in two great Battles, with a small Force under the
Conduct of the incomparable Edward the Black Prince his Son, Duke of Aquitain.
Those were the Battles of Cressy and Poitiers, the first being fought Anno
1343, in the Reign of Philip VI, surnamed de Valois, and that of Poitiers in
the Reign of his Son King John, who was taken Prisoner with Philip his Son, and
brought over into England. But such is the Vicissitude of Humane Affairs, that
the English soon after lost all they had got in these Wars, Calais excepted.
For Charles V, of France, the Son of John, proved too hard for Richard II, of
England, one of our unfortunate Kings, the next Successor of King Edward III,
and his Grandson by Edward the Black Prince.

But Henry V, his next Successor but one, did so far pursue the Title of
France, that he won it, after he had won the great Battle of Agincourt, which
happened Anno 1415. The Opportunity was great, whether we consider the Weakness
and distracted Condition of Charles VI, then King of France, or the very
Distraction of the Kingdom at that time occasioned by the Faction of Burgundy
against that of Orleans. So that, being sought to for Peace, he granted it with
these Conditions, that upon his Marriage with the Lady Catharine, Daughter to
King Charles, he should be made Regent of France, during Charles his Life, and
after the Death of Charles, the Crown of France and a^^ its Rights should
remain to King Henry and his Heirs for ever; which was agreed to ^n ^oth sides.
And, though Henry did not live ^o possess the Kingdom, yet his Son Henry VI,
^ad the fortune to be Crowned King of France in Paris; which he held during the
life of his Uncle John of Bedford, an^ Humfrey of Glo^ester. After whose Deaths
he not only lost France to the French, but England and his Life to the Yorkish
Faction.

Thus Charles VII, Son of Charles VI, after (...) long and bloody War,
recovered from the English, then divided at Home, all their Possessions in
France, except Calais. Which last remained under the English till Queen Mary's
Reign, and was taken from her by Henry II, of France. And ever since Things
have remained much in the same Posture, the Kings of England with the Title to
France, and the French Kings with the Possession. Nay we have had two Kings of
late so passionately inamoured with the present French King, that far from
attempting to take the least Flower of his Crown from him, have promoted his
Greatness, and encouraged his Rapines and unjust Usurpations. The Scope whereof
at last appeared to be no less than the Inslaving this Nation, with the
Assistance of France; and, far from raising the Glory of the English, to make
them an Object of Scorn and Contempt to the World.

But now we are blessed with a wise, just, and magnanimous King, three Virtues
that have been long absent from the Throne of England, we may hope shortly to
see France, if not Conquered again, at least so humbled and weakened, that it
shall not be in her power to insult and incroach upon her Neighbors as she has
in our Time, to the Ruin and Desolation of the best Part of Europe. 'Twas a
notable (if not Prophetic) Answer which an Englishman made to a French
Officer; who, after the English had lost France, asked him in a scoffing
manner, When they would return thither? When your Sins, says he ^^re greater
than ours. As ba^ as this Nation (...) been, it is apparent the French have far
outdone us in their Pride and Lewdness, Cruelties and Usurpations. So that I
hope, from the Disposition of the present Affairs of Europe, the Time is come
for France to give an Account thereof to God and Man.

I come now to the King of England's Titles, which run thus at present, jointly
with Queen Mary; William and Mary, by the Grace of God, King and Queen of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith. Which last
Title was given by Pope Leo X, to King Henry VIII, for a Book written by him
against Luther, in Defense of some Points of the Romish Religion; and
afterward confirmed by Act of Parliament, for Defense of the ancient Catholic
and Apostolic Faith, as it is now professed by the Church of England. Whereas
the King of France is called Most Christian, and the King of Spain Most
Catholic.

The Title of Majesty came not into use in England till the Reign of Henry
VIII. Instead whereof the Title of Grace, now appropriated to the Dukes and the
two Archbishops, was given to former Kings; and that of Highness to the
foresaid King Henry, till the Word Majesty prevailed.

When we speak to the King, the Word Sir is often used, besides Your Majesty;
according to the French Sire, which is likewise applied ^o that King.

For the King's Arms, or Ensigns Armorial, He ^ears in the first place, for the
Regal Arms of ^rance, Azure, 3 Flower de luces Or; quarter^d with the Arms of
England, which are Gules (...) Lions passant Gardant in pale Or. In the se^ond
place, for the Royal Arms of Scotland, a ^ion rampant Gules, within a double
Tressure ^unter flowred de luce Or. In the third place, or Ireland, Azure, an
Irish Harp Or, stringed ^rgent. In the fourth place, as in the first. To which
has been added, since the present King's ^ccession to the Crown, another Lion
in the ^iddle, thus blazoned; Azure a Lion rampant ^r, between an Earl of
Billets Or.

And all this within the Garter, the chief En^gn of that Order; above which is
an Helmet, ^swerable to his Majesty's Sovereign Juris^iction, and upon this a
Mantle. The Mantle (...) Cloth of Gold doubled Ermin, adorned with (...)
Imperial Crown, and surmounted for a Crest (...) a Lion Passant Gardant,
Crowned with the ^^ke. The Supporters a Lion Rampant Gardant (...), Crowned as
the former, and an Unicorn Ar^^t Gorged with a Crown; thereto a Chain af^ed,
passing between his Forelegs, and re^xed over his Back Or. Both standing upon
Compartment placed underneath, and in the ^ce of the Compartment this Royal
Motto, ^en and mon Droit, that is, God and my Right. which Motto was taken up
by Edward the ^ird, when he first claimed the Kingdom of ^ance. Who also gave
the Motto upon the ^^ter, Honi soit qui mal y pense, that is, Shame to him that
evil thereof thinks.

The Arms of France are placed first, as being the greater Kingdom, and perhaps
thereby to induce the French the more easily to ow^ the English Title.

The Ensigns of Royalty, such as Crowns, Scepters, Purple-Robe, Golden-Globe,
and Holy Unction, the King of England has them all.

And so he has all the Marks of Sovereignty As the Power of making Treaties and
League with foreign States, of making Peace or Wa^ of sending and receiving
Ambassadors, Creating of Magistrates, Convening the Parliament of Adjourning,
Proroguing, and Dissolving the same, when he thinks fit, of conferring Title of
Honor, of pardoning some Criminals, o^ Coining, etc. All which Marks of
Sovereignty are by Law lodged in the Crown.

Accordingly the King of England, without the Concurrence of his Parliament,
levies Me^ and Arms for Sea and Land-Service, and may (if need require) press
Men for that purpose He has alone the Choice and Nomination of a^^ Commanders
and Officers, the principal Direction and Command of his Armies, and the
Disposal of all Magazines, Ammunition, Castles Forts, Ports, Havens, Ships of
War. The Militia is likewise wholly at his Command. And though he cannot of
himself raise Money upon his Subjects without his Parliament, yet he ha^ the
sole Disposal of public Moneys

In the Parliament He has a Negative Voice that is, he may (without giving any
Reason for it) refuse to give his Royal Assent to an^ Bill, though passed by
both Houses of Parli^ment; and, without his Assent, such a Bill (...) but like
a Body without Soul. He may at (...) pleasure increase the Number of the House
(...) Peers by creating more Barons, or summoning thither whom he thinks fit by
Writ; and of the House of Commons, by bestowing Privileges on any other Town,
to send Burgesses to Parliament.

He has the Choice and Nomination of all Counselors and Officers of State, of
all the Judges, Bishops, and other high Dignities in the Church.

In short, the King is the Fountain of Honor, Justice, and Mercy. None but the
King has the Sovereign Power in the Administration of Justice; and no Subject
has here, as in France, Haute, Moyenne, and basse Jurisdiction, that is, High,
Mean, or Low Jurisdiction. So that the King only is Judge in his own Cause,
though he deliver his Judgment by the Mouth of his Judges.

By Him is appointed the Metal, Weight, Purity, and Value of Coin; and by his
Proclamation he may make any foreign Coin to be lawful Money of England.

So tender is the Law for the Preservation of his Sacred Person, that, without
any overt Act, the very Imagining or intending the Death of the King, is High
Treason by Law. And, though by Law an Idiot or Lunatic, Non Compos Mentis,
cannot commit Felony, nor any sort of Treason; yet, if during his Idiocy or
Lunacy, he shall Kill, or go about to Kill the King, he shall be punished as a
Traitor.

In point of Physic, by an ancient Record, it is declared, That no Physic
ought to be administered to the King, without a Warrant signed by the Privy
Council, by no other Physician but what is mentioned in the Warrant, and the
Physicians to prepare it themselves with their own hands. If there be occasion
for a Surgeon, he must be likewise authorized by a Warrant.

And such is the Honor and Respect the King of England receives from his
Subjects, that (...) Prince in Christendom receives more Homage Not only all
Persons stand bare in his presence, but even in his absence, where he has a
Chai^ of State. All People at their first Address kneel to him, and he is at
all times served upon the Knee.

It Is true, the King of England is not free to act contrary to, or to dispense
with the known established Laws. Neither can he of himself repeal a Law, or
make any new Law, without the Concurrence of both Houses of Parliament. A happy
Impotency, both to King and People. For, whilst the King keeps within the
Bounds of the Law, he can do no Wrong, and the People can receive no Harm.

Had the late King but acted accordingly, he might have been a most glorious
Monarch, instead of being now a general Object of Pity. Far from being
necessitated to creep under the shelter of a Proud Monarch, he might have been
a Curb to his Pride, and the Refuge of many Nations that suffered Fire and
Sword, to advance what he called his Glory. Three Crowns at once are too great
a Sacrifice, not to God, but to a Mercenary Crew of Priests and Jesuits. Tantum
Religio potuit suadere Malorum.

As to the Rank and Reputation of the Kings of England, when all Christendom in
the Council of Constance was divided into Nations, the English was one of the
Principal, and not Subaltern, having its Voice of equal balance with the
Nations of France or Italy. In those General Councils the Emperor of Germany
was counted Major Filius Ecclesiae, the King of France Minor Filius, and the
King of England Filius tertius and adoptivus. Whereas, with submission,
methinks it had been more proper, especially in such Assemblies, to look upon
the King of England as Primogenitus Ecclesiae, the Eldest Son of the Church,
out of respect to the British King Lucius, who (as I said before) was the first
King in the World that embraced Christianity. In those Councils, the King of
France had place next the Emperor on his right hand, the King of England next
on his left hand, and the King of Scotland next before Castille.

However the King of England acknowledges no Precedence to any Monarch, but
only to the Emperor, and that upon the Score of Antiquity. For the Crown of
England is free and independent, and therefore has been declared in Parliaments
long since to be an Imperial Crown.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Solemn Proclamation, and Coronation of the King of England.

THE Kings of England are both Proclaimed and Crowned with so much Solemnity,
that it will not be improper to describe the Manner of it, it being a Solemnity
not at all disagreeable to the Design of this Work.

I begin with the Proclamation, which is the first Step to the Crown. And,
being we are upon the New State of England, I shall describe the Manner how the
present King William and Queen Mary were Proclaimed at Whitehall-Gate, within
Temple Bar, in Cheap-side^ and the Royal Exchange. Which happened o^ the 13th
of Febr. Anno 1688/9.

The Lords and Commons, being then Assembled at Westminster, came to the
Banqueting House, where they presented the Princ^ and Princess of Orange the
Instrument in Writing agreed upon for Declaring Their Highness KING and QUEEN
of England, France and Ireland, with all the Dominions and Te^tories thereunto
belonging, and received Their Consent thereto.

About 11 of the Clock, the said Lords and Commons came down to Whitehall Gate,
preceded by the Speakers of their respective Hous^^ viz. the Marquess of
Hallifax Speaker (...) Lords, and Henry Powle Esquire Speaker of (...)mons, each of
them attended by a (...) Arms, in order to see Their Majesty's (...).

Being come down to the Gate, there they found the Heralds of Arms, the
Sergeants at Arms, the Trumpets, and other Officers, all in readiness, being
assembled by Order from the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England. And Sr.
Thomas S. George Knight Garter, Principal King of Arms, having received a
Proclamation in Writing, with an Order from the Lords House to the King's
Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms for Publishing or Proclaiming the same
forthwith, the Persons concerned disposed themselves in Order before the
Court-Gate, for making the said Proclamation. The Trumpets having sounded a
Call three several times, the last of which was answered by a great Shout of
the vast Multitudes of People there assembled, the Noise ceasing, the said
Garter King of Arms read the' Proclaimation by short Sentences or Periods;
Which was thereupon proclaimed aloud by Robert Devenish Esquire York Herald, being
the Senior Herald, in these Words.

WHEREAS it has pleased Almighty God, in his great Mercy to this Kingdom, to
vouchsafe as a Miraculous Deliverance from Popery and Arbitrary Power, and that
our Preservation is due, next unto God, to the Resolution and Conduct of His
Highness the Prince of Orange, whom God has chosen to be the Glorious
Instrument of such an Inestimable Happiness to us and our Posterity; And being
highly sensible and fully persuaded of the Great and Eminent Virtues of her
Highness the Princess of Orange, whose Zeal for the Protestant Religion will no
doubt bring a Blessing along with Her upon the Nation; And whereas the Lords
and Commons now Assembled at Westminster have made a Declaration, and presented
the same to the said Prince and Princess of Orange, and therein desired Them to
Accept the Crown, who have Accepted the same accordingly; We therefore the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, Together with the Lord Mayor and
Citizens of London, and others of the Commons of this Realm, Do, with a full
Consent, Publish and Proclaim, according to the said Declaration, William and
Mary Prince and Princess of Orange, to be KING and QVEEN of England, France,
and Ireland, with all the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging; Who
are accordingly so to be owned, deemed, accepted, and taken by all the People
of the aforesaid Realms and Dominions, who are henceforward bound to
acknowledge and pay unto The^ all Faith and true Allegiance. Beseeching God, by
whom Kings Reign, to bless KING WILLIAM and QVEEN MARY with long and happy
Years to Reign over us.

God save King William and Queen Mary.

Jo. Brown, Cleric. Parliamentorum.

Which being ended, and the Trumpe^ sounding a Flourish, was answered by

XII. The Members of the House of Commons, in their Coaches.

In this Order they proceeded toward Temple Bar. And, being come as far as the
May Pole in the Strand, two of the Officers of Arms, with a Sergeant at Arms,
and two Trumpets, went before to Temple Bar; where the Lord Mayor, Aldermen,
and Sheriffs were by this time arrived, and had ordered the Gates to be shut.
The Herald at Arms knocked thereat; and the Sheriffs being come to the Gate on
Horseback, he acquainted them, That he came, by Order of the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal assembled at Westminster, to demand Entrance into that famous
City, for the Proclaiming of WILLIAM and MART King and Queen of England,
France, and Ireland, and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging, and
therefore required their speedy Answer. Whereupon the said Sheriffs ordered the
Gates to be opened.

Thus the Head-Bayliff, Constables, and Beadles of Westminster being left
without the Bar, the rest of the Proceeding entered Where they found the Lord

Majesty's a second time.

From whence they marched toward Cheapside, a Class of the City-Trumpets, and
the Lord Mayor's Livery-men leading the Way, the said Aldermen and Lord Mayor
falling into the Proceeding. And near Wood-street end (the Place where
Cheap Side Cross formerly stood) they made another stand, and Proclaimed Their
Majesty's a third time.

At last arriving at the Royal Exchange about two of the Clock, they Proclaimed
Them a fourth time.

Each Proclamation was ecchoed with universal Acclamations of Joy by the
Multitudes of people which crowded the Streets, Windows, and Balconies; the
Streets all the way from Temple Bar to the Royal Exchange being lined with four
Regiments of the City Militia. And the Night was concluded with Bonfires,
Ringing of Bells, and all other Expressions of Duty and Affection toward Their
Majesty's King WILLIAM and Queen MARY, with hearty Wishes for Their long and
happy Reign.

Their Coronation was performed at Westminster in Manner following, Apr. 11th
1689.

Their Majesty's being come about Noon from Whitehall to the Palace at
Westminster, where the Nobility and others who were to go into the Proceeding
were assembled, came down in State from the House of Lords to Westminster Hall,
then fitted up for this great Solemnity. Where being seated on the Throne, the
Sword of State, the Curtana or pointless Sword, being an Emblem of Mercy, and
the two pointed Swords, together with the gold Spurs, were presented to Their
Majesty's, and laid on a Table before Them.

Then the Dean and Prebends of Westminster, having before brought the Crowns
and other Regalia in solemn Procession from the Collegiate Church there, came

and the Peers and Peeresses put on their Coronets.

Then the Bible was presented to Their Majesty's; and, after the Benediction.
They vouchsafed to kiss the Bishops. Being Inthroned, first the Bishops, and
then the Temporal Lords did their Homage, and Kissed Their Majesty's left
Cheeks. In the mean while the Treasurer of the Household threw about the
Coronation Medals; which were of Silver, about the bigness of a half-crown
Piece, representing of one side the King and Queen, with their Names thus,
Gulielmus and Maria Rex and Regina. And, on the Reverse, giddy-brained
Phaethon, unskilfully guiding the Chariot of the Sun; with Jupiter above
striking him with a Thunderbolt; and this Motto about it, Ne Totus Absumatur,
that is, Lest the whole World be Consumed with fire. A very pat Emblem to the
present Juncture, as those may best judge who are well acquainted with the
Story of Phaethon.

Next, followed the Communion. And Their Majesty's, having made Their second
Oblation, received the holy Sacrament. Then the Bishop read the final Prayers.
After Prayers, Their Majesty's retired into S. Edward's Chapel, where they were
new Arrayed in Purple Velvet. And in this Habit they returned to
Westminster Hall, with Their rich Crowns of State upon their Heads, and the
Nobility their Coronets.

A splendid Dinner being prepared in the Hall for Their Majesty's, and the
whole Proceeding, the first Course for Their Majesty's Table was served up with
the proper Ceremony, being preceded by the great Officers, and the High
Constable, High Steward, and Earl Marshal. But the Tables of the Nobility, etc.
were all ready furnished, before their Coming in.

Before the second Course, Charles Dymoke Esquire Their Majesty's Champion, came
into the Hall on horseback, between the High Constable and the Earl Marshal;
where be performed the Challenge. After which the Heralds proclaimed Their
Majesty's Styles.

Dinner being ended, and the whole Solemnity performed with great Splendor and
Magnificence, Their Majesty's about eight in the Evening returned to Whitehall.

CHAP. IX.
Of the King's peculiar Prerogatives. Also, of His Power, Court, and Revenues,
in general.

BEsides the Royal Marks of Sovereignty inherent in the Crown of England, the
King has certain Privileges, properly called by the Name of Prerogatives,
which are so many Flowers of the Crown. The principal are these that follow.

First, all Estates, for want of Heirs, or by Forfeiture, escheat (or revert)
to the King. To Him also belong all Lands of Aliens, dying before
Naturalization or Denization, unless they leave Issue born within his
Dominions; All Waste Ground or Land recovered from the Sea; All Gold and Silver
Mines, in whose Ground soever they are found; All Wayfs, Strays, and Wracks,
not granted away by Him or any of his Predecessors; All Treasure found, as
Gold, Silver, Plate, Bullion, etc. the Owner whereof is unknown; All Royal
Fishes, as Whales, Dolphins, etc. And Royal Fowl, as Swans not marked, and
swimming at liberty on the River.

The King, by his Prerogative, has the Right of Pre-emption of all Sorts of
Victuals near the Court; and may take Horses, Carts, Ships, and Boats, for his
Carriages, at reasonable Rates.

By his Letters Patent he may erect new Counties, Cities, Boroughs,
Universities, Colleges, Schools, Hospitals, Fairs, Markets, Forests, Chases,
Free-Warrens, etc. And, without his Authority, no Forest, Chase, or Park can be
made, or Castle built.

He has Power likewise to Infranchise an Alien, and make him a Denison, whereby
he is enabled to purchase Houses and Lands, and to bear some Offices. But none
can be Naturalized but by King and Parliament.

The King only can give Letters of Mart or Reprisal. And, in case of Losses by
Fire or otherwise, He only can give Patents to receive the charitable
Benevolences of the People, without which no Man may ask it publicly.

Debts due to the King are in the first place to be satisfied, in case of
Executorship and Administratorship; and, till the Kings Debts be satisfied, He
may protect the Debtor from the Arrest of other Creditors.

He may Distrein for the whole Rent upon one Tenant, tho he do not hold the
whole Land; Is not obliged to demand his Rent, as others are; and may sue in
what Court he pleases, and Distrain where he list.

No Occupancy can stand good against the King, nor any Entry before Him
prejudice him. And the Sale of the Kings Goods in open Market does not take
away his Property therein.

All Receivers of Money for the King, or Accomptants to Him for any Branch of
his Revenues, are chargeable for the same at all times, in their Persons,
Lands, Goods, Heirs, Executors, and Administrators.

And, when any Debtor to the King is disabled to pay him, by reason of Debts
owing him which he has not been able to recover, in such a Case the Kings
Debtor being Plaintiff has some Privileges above others, by virtue of a Quo
minus in the Exchequer.

In Doubtful Cases, always there ought to be a particular Regard and
favorable Presumption for the King. And Judgments against the King's Title are
always entered with a Salvo Jure Domini Regis; That if at any time the King's
Council at Law can make out his Title better, that Judgment shall not prejudice
Him. Which is not so for a Subject.

The King's Servants in Ordinary are free from Arrest; also, from all Offices
that require their Attendance, as Sheriff, Constable, Churchwarden, etc. And,
for reasonable Causes Him thereunto moving, He may protect any Man against
Suits at Law, etc. with a Noli Prosequi.

As to Church Matters, the King by Act of Parliament is the Supreme Head of the
Church, as He is of the State; and is looked upon as her Guardian, and Nursing
Father.

He is (as Constantine the Emperor said of himself) an external Bishop of the
Church, and in some Sense a Priest as well as a King. Therefore at his
Coronation He is Anointed with Oil, as the Priests were at first, and
afterward the Kings of Israel, to intimate that his Person is Sacred and
Spiritual; and has the Dalmatica, and other Priestly Vests, put upon Him.

By virtue of his Prerogative, He has Power to call a National or Provincial
Synod; and to make such Alterations in the Church Discipline as they shall
judge expedient.

And, as He is the Lord Paramount, or Supreme Landlord, of all the Lands in
England; so He has all over England the Supreme Right of Patronage, called
Patronage Paramount. Insomuch that, if the mean Patron, or the Ordinary, or the
Metropolitan, present not in due time, the Right of Presentation comes at at
last to the King.

As for the Bishoprics, the King only has the Patronage of them. For none can
be chosen Bishop, but whom he nominates in his Conge d'Estire; and a Bishop
Elect cannot be Consecrated, or take possession of the Revenues of the
Bishopric, without the King's special Writ or Assent.

In short, as the King is the only Sovereign and Supreme Head both in Church
and State, so there lies no Appeal from Him, as from some other States and
Kingdoms beyond Sea, either to the Pope of Rome, or to the Emperor.

But indeed the greatest and safest of the Kings Prerogatives is, as the
present King wrote in a late Letter to his Council of Scotland, to Rule
according to Law, and with Moderation.

The Dispensing Power, so much contended for in the late Reign by the
Court-Party as a Branch of the Kings Prerogative, and as vigorously opposed by
some true Patriots, is ^ow quite out of Doors by the Act of Settlement, which
makes it plainly Illegal.

And, as to that divine Prerogative which the Kings of England claimed as a
Thing de Jure divino, I mean the Curing of the King's Evil, only by the King's
laying his hands on the Sick, assisted with a short Form of Divine Service, it
is now laid aside, as a Traditional Error, at least a Doctrine not fit to be
trusted ^o. So that the French King is at this time the only Monarch that
pretends to this Miraculous Privilege. Our Historians derived it here from
King Edward the Confessor, who lived so holy a Life, that (as they say) he
received Power from above, Intailed to his Royal Successors for ever, to cure
this stubborn Disease. But now 'cis looked upon as a Doctrine not so fit for
Protestants as bigoted Papists, to whom no Miracle is amiss.

I come now to the King's Power, with relation to foreign Parts; Which I shall
describe as near as I can, first as Defensive, secondly as Offensive.

In the first Sense, England, if well united, is of all the States in Europe
the least subject to an Invasion, especially since the Conjunction of Scotland.
The whole Island is naturally so well senced with the Ocean, and (when Occasion
requires) so well guarded by those moving Castles, the King's Ships of War, the
strongest and best built in the whole World. The Kingdom besides is so
abundantly furnished with Men and Horses, with Provisions and Ammunition, and
Money the Sinews of War, that nothing but our intestine Divisions can make us a
Prey to the greatest Potentates of Europe, tho united together.

As for the King's Power abroad, not only our Neighbors, but the most remote
Places, have sufficiently felt it, and this at a time when Scotland and Ireland
were usually at enmity with Him. It Is true, since the Reign of Q^ Elizabeth,
what with our Distractions at home, and the Weakness or Effeminacy of some of
one Kings, England has either been Idle, or taken up with Intestine Broils.
Only, in Cromwell's Time, we humbled the Hollanders, scowred the Algerines, kept
the French and the Pope in aw, and took Jamaica from Spain. Our greatest
Exploits were upon our own selves, when, being unhappily involved in Civil Wars
for several Years together, we destroyed one another with a fatal Courage. Then
were computed about two hundred thousand Foot, and fifty thousand Horse, to be
in Arms on both, sides; which, had they been employed abroad, might have shaken
the greatest part of Europe. And here I cannot but with an aching heart apply
the Words of Lucan, Heu! quantum potuit Coeli Pelagique parari
Hoc quem Civiles fuderunt Sanguine Dextrae!


In English thus, How much both Sea and Land might have been gained
By their dear Blood, which Civil Wars have drained?


Of so martial Spirit the English are, and their fear of Death so little, that
(as Dr. Chamberlain has well observed) no Neighbour^^ation scarce durst ever
abide Battle with them, either by Sea or Land, upon equal Terms. and now we are
engaged in a just War both with Ireland and France, under a Prince of ^o great
Conduct and Courage, encouraged by ^^s Parliament, assisted and faithfully
served by the greatest General now in Europe, I cannot but hope well from our
Armies both by Seu and Land, if our provoked God do not fight against us.

The next Thing that offers it self to our Consideration, is the King of
England's Court, which for State, Greatness, and good Order, besides the
constant Concourse of Nobility and Gentry resorting thither, when there is no
Jealousy between the King and his People, is one of the chief Courts of Europe.
It is, as an Author says, a Monarchy within a Monarchy, consisting of
Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Military Persons, the two last under their proper
Government.

To support the Grandeur of this Court, and the other Charges of the Crown in
time of Peace, the Kings of England have always had competent Revenues. Which
never were raised by any of those sordid Ways used in other Countries; but
consist chiefly in Domains or Lands belonging to the Crown, in Customs, and
Excise.

Anciently the very Domains of the Crown, and Fee-Farm Rents, were so
considerable, that they were almost sufficient to discharge all the ordinary
Expenses of the Crown, without any Tax or Impost upon the Subject. Then there
was scarce a County in England but the King had in it a Royal Castle, a Forest,
and a Park, to Receive and Divert Him in his Royal Progresses. A piece of
Grandeur, which no King else could boast of. But, upon the Restoration of King
Charles, the Crown Revenues being found much Impaired, and the Crown Charges
increasing upon the growing Greatness of our Neighbors the French and Dutch,
the Parliament settled upon the King a Yearly Revenue of Twelve Hundred
Thousand Pounds, by several Imposts; besides the Domains and other Profits
arising to the Crown in Tenths and First Fruits, in Reliefs, Fines,
Amerciaments, and Confiscations. And the whole Revenue improved to that degree,
that in the late Reign it was judged to amount to near two Millions. Which is a
Fair Revenue in Time of Peace.

In Time of War, the Parliament supplies the King, according to his Occasions,
by such Taxes to be raised upon the Nation as they think most convenient.

CHAP. X.
Of the Government of England by Regency; Also, of the Succession to the Crown.

THere are three Cases, wherein the Kingdom of England is not immediately
governed by the King, but by a Substitute Regent. And those are the Kings
Minority, Absence, or Incapacity.

The King is by Law under Age, when he is under twelve Years old. And, till he
has attained to that Age, the Kingdom is governed by a Regent, Protector, or
Guardian, appointed either by the King his Predecessor, or (for want of such
Appointment,) by the Three States assembled in the Name of the Infant King.
Who, in such Case, usually make choice of such a Person among the Nobility, as
is fit for that Station, whose private Interest is to preserve the Kings Life
and Authority, and to whom least benefit can accrue by his Death or Diminution.

Thus, in the Case of Edward VI, the Duke of Somerset, his Uncle by the Mothers
side, was made Lord Protector during the Kings Minority. And, when this Rule
has not been observed, as in the Minority of Edward V, it has proved of very
ill consequence.

But this is observable withal, that when the King comes to be 24 Years of
Age, he may b^ his Letters Patents under the Great Seal (a^cording to a Statute
made in the Reign of Henry VIII,) revoke and utterly null whatsoeve^ has been
Enacted in Parliament during his M^nority.

When the King was Absent upon any so reign Expedition (as several of our Kings
have been with good success,) the Custom was for merly to constitute a
Vicegerent, by Commission under the Great Seal, with the Tit^ of Lord Warden
(or Lord Keeper) of the Kingdom, and sometimes that of Protector. And such was
the Latitude of his Power, that, except wearing of the Crown, he was as great
a^ the King. But sometimes the Kingdom, durin^ the King's Absence, has been
committed to the Care of several Noblemen.

During the Absence of Henry VIII, in France which happened two several times,
the Quee^ was made Regent. And so is at this time o^^ Gracious Queen Mary,
during his Majesty's so reign Expedition.

So, in case of the Kings Incapacity to govern, either through Age, or
Weakness, or by reason of some Incurable Disease, a Guardian (...) Regent is
constituted to govern the Kingdom for Him. Such a one was John Duke of L^^
caster, in the latter Days of King Edward (...) appointed by the King himself;
who then what with Age and Weakness, what with Sickness and Grief for the
untimely Death of (...) dear Son the Black Prince, was much decay^ both in Body
and Mind.

I come now to the Succession to the Cr^^ Which is not in England as in France,
Tur^^ and amongst Barbarians, by excluding Females from the Crown. For the
Crown of England, in its natural Course, descends from Father to S^n, for want
of Sons to the eldest Daughter, and her Heirs; for want of Daughter, to the
Brother and his Heirs; for want of Brother, to the Sister and her Heirs.

In short, upon the Death of the King or Queen upon the Throne, the next of
Kindred (though born out of the Dominions of England, or of Parents not
Subjects of England) is immediately King or Queen, before any Proclamation, or
Coronation. And, contrary to the Descent of Estates among Subjects, the Half
Blood inherits; as in the Case of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, who succeeded
King Edward the Sixth, though they were his Sisters only by the Father's side.

But the Government being lately Dissolved by King James his Misgovernment as
well as Abdication, the Crown was settled in this manner by the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and Commons assembled at Westminster in the Month of December,
Anno 1689. First upon William and Mary, then Prince and Princess of Orange,
during their Lives, and the Life of the Survivor of Them; but the sole and full
Exercise of the Regal Power to be only in, and executed by the said Prince of
Orange, in the Names of the said Prince and Princess, during their joint Lives.
And, after their Deceases, the said Crown and Royal Dignity to be to the ^eirs
of the Body of the said Princess. And, for default of such Issue, to the
Princess Anne of Denmark, and the Heirs of her Body. And, for default of such
Issue, to the Heirs of the Body of the said Prince of Orange. Upon which the
said Prince and Princess (now King and Queen of England, etc.) did accept the
Crown and Royal Dignity of the Kingdoms o^ England, France, and Ireland, and
the Dominions thereunto belonging.

And, for preventing all Questions and Divisions in this Realm, by reason of
any pretended Titles to the Crown, and for preserving a Certainty in the
Succession thereof, the Settlement of the Crown (as aforesaid) was Confirmed by
an Act of the Ensuing Parliament, which passed the Royal Assent, Dec 16. 1689.
With this excellent Proviso, That, Whereas it has been found by Experience,
that it is Inconsistent with the Safety and Welfare of this Protestant Kingdom,
to be Governed by a Popis^ Prince, or by any King or Queen Marrying Papist, all
and every Person and Persons tha^ is, are, or shall be Reconciled to, or shall
hol^ Communion with the Sea or Church of Rome or shall profess the Popish
Religion, or shall Marry a Papist, shall be Excluded, and be soever Incapable
to Inherit, Possess, or Enjoy the Crown and Government of this Realm and
Ireland, and the Dominions thereunto belon^ing, or any Part of the same, or to
Have, Us^ or Exercise any Regal Power, Authority, or J^risdiction within the
same; And, in all and (...) very such Case or Cases, the People of the^ Realms
shall be, and are hereby Absolved (...) their Allegiance; and the said Crown
and Government shall from time to time Descend (...) and be Enjoyed by such
Person or Persons, ^^ing Protestants, as should have Inherit^^ or Enjoyed the
same, in case the said P^^son or Persons, so Reconciled, holding Communion, or
Professing, or Marrying, as afo^^said, were naturally Dead.

By which Act, further Confirmed and Asserted by the Act of Recognition passed
in the last Session of Parliament, the Crown is by Law for ever Insured into
Protestant Hands, and all Pretense of Popish Succession Nulled and Invalidated.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Royal Family; Particularly of the Queen, and the Sons and Daughters of
England.

THe Queen of England is either a Sovereign, or Queen Consort, or else Queen
Dowager.

When the Queen is Sovereign, as were Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, (the two
Daughters of Henry VIII, and Sisters of Edward VI.) he is invested with all the
Regal Power, and ^cts as Sovereign. And whoever she does marry ^o, far from
following her Husbands Condition, ^he is her Husbands Sovereign, as Queen Mary
^as Philip's.

The Case indeed of our present Queen Mary is ^ifferent. She is a Sovereign,
jointly with her ^usband King William; but the Administration (...) the
Government, and the sole Executive Power ^^lodged only in the King during their
Joint ^^ves. Except the Time of his Majesty's Absence (...) his foreign
Expedition; during which, Her ^jesty is Vested by a late Act of Parliament with
the Administration, and acts as Queen Regent.

A Queen Consort, without Sovereignty, is Reputed however the Second Person in
the Kingdom, and Respected accordingly. The Law sets so high a value upon Her,
as to make it High Treason to conspire her Death, or to violate her Chastity.
She has her Royal Court, and Officers apart; with a large Dower to maintain her
Greatness. And, though she be an Alien born, yet without Denization or
Naturalization, she may purchase Lands in Fee-simple, make Leases and Grants,
and sue in her own Name, without the King; which is not in the power of any
other Feme-covert (or married Woman) to do.

A Queen Dowager or Widow-Queen, is still Respected as a Queen in her
Widowhood, and keeps a Court accordingly. And, though she should marry a
private Gentleman (as did Queen Catharine, King Henry the Fifths Widow,) she
does not lose her Dignity.

By the Sons and Daughters of England, I mean the King's Children. So called,
because all the Subjects of England have a special Interest i^ Them; though
their Education, and the Disposing of Them, is only in the King.

The Eldest Son, commonly called the Prince of Wales, is born Duke of Cornwall,
and afterward created Prince of Wales. Upon his Birth he is by Law of full Age
to sue for the Livery of the said Dukedom, as if he were full a Years of Age.
But so much of the Lands (...) Demesns of it have been Alienated, that h^
Revenues are chiefly out of the Tin-Mines i^ Cornwall. Which, with all other
Profits of the Duchy, amount yearly to the Sum of 140^ Pounds; and the
Prince's whole Revenues, to about 20000 l.

When King Edward I, had completed the Conquest of Wales, He divided it into
Seven Shires, to which Henry VIII, added five more out of the March Lands. Over
each of the Seven Shires King Edward placed a particular English Lieutenant,
and over the whole he designed a Vicegerent. The Welsh being disgusted at this,
He sent for his Queen, then great with Child, to Caernarvan, where she was
delivered of a Son. Upon the News whereof, the King assembled the Chief Men of
that Nation, and offered to name them a Governor born in Wales, who could not
speak one word of English, and against whose Life they could take no just
exception. Such a one when they had all sworn to obey, he named his young Son
Edward. Whereupon He created him Prince of Wales; and since that time, the
Kings of England eldest Sons have been called Princes of Wales. Whereas, while
Normandy was in the Power of the English, which lasted till the Reign of King
John, they were styled Dukes of Normandy.

The Investiture is performed by the Imposition of a Cap of Estate, and a
Coronet on the Princes Head, as a Token of his Principality; by delivering into
his hand a Verge of Gold, the Emblem of Government; by putting a Gold Ring on
his Finger, in token that he must be a Husband to his Country, and a Father to
her Children; and by giving him a Patent, to hold the said Principality to Him
and his Heirs Kings of England. By which Words the Separation of it from the
Crown is prohibited, and the King keeps to himself an excellent Occasion of
obliging unto Him his Son, when he pleases.

In Imitation of which Custom, John I, King of Castille and Leon, made his Son
Henry Prince of the Asturias; a Country so Craggy and Mountainous, that it may
not improperly be called the Wales of Spain. And all the Spanish Princes ever
since have been honored with that Title.

The Mantle worn in Parliament by the Prince of Wales has (for Distinctions
sake) one guard more than a Duke's; his Coronet, of Crosses and Flower de luces,
and his Cap of State indented.

His Arms differ from the Kings, only by addition of a Label of three points.
And his peculiar Device is a Coronet beautified with three Ostrich Feathers,
inscribed with ICH DIEN, that is, I serve; Alluding perhaps to that in the
Gospel, The Heir, while he is a Child, differs not from a Servant. Which Device
was born at the Battle of Cressy by John King of Bohemia, serving there under
the French King, and there slain by Edward the Black Prince. Since worn by the
Princes of Wales, and by the Vulgar called the Princes Arms.

In short, the King of England's Eldest Son has ever since been styled Prince
of Wales, Duke of Aquitain and Cornwall, and Earl of Chester and Flint; these
Earldoms being conferred upon him by Letters Patent. As Eldest Son to the King
of Scotland, he is Duke of Rothsay, and Seneschal of Scotland from his Birth.

Though he is a Subject, yet the Law looks upon his Person as so Sacred, that
it is high Treason to imagine his Death, or violate his Wife.

The Younger Sons of England depend altogether upon the King's Favor, both for
Titles, of Honor, and Revenues suitable to their Birch. For they are not born
Dukes, or Earls; but are so created, according to the Kings Pleasure. Neither
have they, as in France, certain Appanages; but only what Revenue the King
pleases to bestow upon them.

They are indeed by Birthright, as well as the Prince of Wales, Counselors of
State, whereby they may fit themselves to manage the weighty Affairs of the
Kingdom.

The Daughters are called Princesses. And, to violate them unmarried is High
Treason.

The Title of Royal Highness is common to all the King's Children. All Subjects
ought to be uncovered in their Presence, to kneel when they are admitted to
kiss their hands, and to be served on the Knee at Table, unless the King be
present.

Lastly, all Persons of the Royal Blood, being a Lawful Issue, have the
Precedence of all others in England.

As for the King's Natural (or Illegitimate) Sons and Daughters, they are
commonly created Dukes and Dutchesses; and bear what Surname the King pleases
to give them. King Henry I. and Charles II. of blessed Memory, are noted to
have had the most of any.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Nine Great Officers of the Crown.

NEXT to the Royal Family, the Great Officers of the Crown come of course to be
Inquired into, which are Nine in Number.

Viz. The Lord High Steward, The Lord High Chancellor, The Lord High Treasurer,
The Lord President of the Kings Council. The Lord Privy Seal, The Lord Great
Chamberlain, The Lord High Constable, The Lord Earl Marshal, The Lord High
Admiral.


The Lord High Steward of England is the highest Officer under the King. His
Office not unlike that of the Mayre of the Palace under the ancient Kings of
France, is to rule and govern the Kingdom under the King, in Time of Peace and
War, during his Reign, Which Power being thought too large and exorbitant for a
Subject to have, this Great Officer has been discontinned ever since Henry of
Bullingbrock, Son to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, afterward King of
England under the Name of Henry IV. Only at a Coronation, also for the Trial of
a Peer or Peeress for Treason or Felony, or some other great Crime, the King
makes a High Steward for that Time. Who, during his Stewardship, is called His
Grace; and bears a white Staff in his hand, which he openly breaks when the
Business is over, and so ends his Office.

By virtue of his Office at a Coronation, he sits Judicially at the King's
Palace at Westminster. Where he receives the Bills and Petitions of all such
Noblemen and others, who (by reason of their Tenure, or otherwise) claim to do
Services at the King's Coronation, and to receive the accustomed Fees and
Allowances. In the Procession on the Coronation-Day, it is he that carries the
King's Crown. The Right Honorable the Earl of Devonshire was honored with
this great Office in the last Coronation.

Upon the Trial of a Peer he sits under a Cloth of State, and his Commission is
to proceed secundum Legem and Consuetudinem Angliae. He is not Sworn, nor the
Lords who are the Tryers of the Peer arraigned; and, tho he call all the Judges
of the Land to assist him; yet he is the sole Judge.

Next to the Lord High Steward is the Lord High Chancellor, who in Civil
Affairs (now there is no High Steward) is the highest Person in the Kingdom
next to the Royal Family, as the Archbishop of Canterbury is in Ecclesiastical.

His Oath is to do Right to all manner of People, rich and poor, after the Laws
and Customs of the Realm, truly to counsel the King, and keep secret the King's
Counsel, to stand for the Rights of the Crown, etc.

The Great Seal of England is in his Custody. He is the Judge of the Court of
Chancery, otherwise called the Court of Equity; where he is to judge, not
according to the Rigor and Letter of the Law, but with Equity and Conscience.
He also bestow's all Ecclesiastical Benefices in the King's Gift under 20 l. a
Year in the King's Books.

Since the Reign of Henry VII. this great Office has been commonly executed by
Lawyers; whereas formerly Bishops, and other Clergymen learned in the Civil
Laws, were usually entrusted with it.

The Lord High Chancellor holds his Place but durante Regis Beneplacito,
during the King's Pleasure. And his Place is counted to be worth 8000 l. a Year.

Anciently he had sometimes a Vice Chancellor, commonly called Keeper of the
Great Seal. But of later Times they differ only in Name. For the late Kings
have always beflowed the Great Seal, either with the Title of Lord Keeper, or
of Lord Chancellor; but still with the same Power, and Right of Precedence.
Only the Lord Chancellor receives a Patent from the King for his Office, which
the Lord Keeper does not; and by the Title of Chancellor he is looked upon as
in greater favor with the King.

But his present Majesty, since his Accession to the Crown, thought fit to have
this Office managed by Commissioners; and accordingly it has been hitherto
managed by three Lords Commissioners.

The third Great Officer of the Crown is the Lord High Treasurer, who has the
Charge and Government of all the King's Revenue kept in the Exchequer.

He has the Gift of all Customers, Comptrolers, and Searchers in all the Ports
of England; and the Nomination of all Escheators in every County. He has also
the Check of all the Officers employed in collecting all the Revenues of the
Crown. He has power either by himself, or with others joined in Commission with
him, to let Leases of all the Crown Lands. And it is he that gives Warrants to
certain Persons of Quality, to have their Wine Custom-free.

Anciently he received this Office and Dignity by the delivery of the golden
Keys of the Treasury, which is now done by delivery of a white Staff to him by
the King.

His Oath does not differ much from that of the Lord Chancellor; and he holds
his Place, as he does, during his Majesty's Pleasure. His Place is also
reckoned to be worth 8000 l. per ann.

But this great Office is now executed by four Persons, called the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.

Next is the Lord President of the King's Privy Council, an Officer as ancient
as King John's Time, made by the King's Letters Patent under the Great Seal,
durante Beneplacito. His Office is to manage the Debates in Council, to propose
Matters from the King, and report the Transactions to his Majesty.

In the late Reigns this Office was often supplied by the Chancellor.

Next to the Lord President is the Lord Privy Seal, whose Office is of great
Trust and Skill. He is so called from the Privy Seal, which is in his custody.
All Charters and Grants of the King, and all Pardons signed by the King, pass
through his hands, before they come to the Great Seal of England. And h^^ ought
not to put this Seal to any Grant, with out good Warrant under the King's
Privy Signet; nor with Warrant, if it be against Law or Custom, until the King
be first acquainted. He manages also diverse other Matters of less concernment,
which do not pass the Great Seal.

He is, by his Place, of the King's Privy Council, and takes his Oath
accordingly; besides a particular Oath, as Lord Privy Seal. When there is a
Court of Requests, he is the chie^ Judge of it.

His Place is also during the King's Pleasure (...) and his Salary is 1500 l.
per annum.

The sixth Great Officer of the Crown i^ the Lord Great Chamberlain of England,
an Officer of State, and of great Antiquity, whose chief Business is on the
Coronation-Day. For it is his Office that Day to bring the King his Shirt,
Coyf, and Wearing Clothes before his Majesty rises; and to carry at the
Coronation the Coyf, Gloves, and Linen to be used by the King upon that
Occasion. In the Church where the King is Crowned he undresses and attires his
Majesty with Robes Royal, and give^ Him the Gold which is offered by Him at the
Altar. Before and after Dinner he serves the King with Water, to wash his hands.

For this Service he has 40 Else of Cri^^son Velver for-his own Robes, the
King's Be^ and all the Furniture of his Bedchamber all the King's
Night-Apparel, and the Baso^ and Towels used at Dinner, for his Fees.

He has also Livery and Lodging in the King's Court, certain ^ees from all
Peers of the Realm at their Creation, and from each Archbishop or Bishop when
they do their Ho^^age or Fealty to the King.

To him belongs the Care of providing all Things in the House of Lords in
Parliament-Time, and therefore has an Apartment allowed him near the House of
Lords.

This Office is Hereditary, and belongs to the Earls of Lindsey.

The Lord High Constable is another great Officer, but of too great Authority
and Power to be continued, and therefore is only created for the Solemnity of
the King's Coronation. The Duke of Ormond was High Constable in the last.

The next is the Earl Marshal of England, an Officer of great Antiquity, and
anciently of great Power. His proper Office is to summon the Nobility to the
King's Coronation, with such Directions for State and public Appearance as
becomes that Solemnity. He also takes Cognizance of Matters of War and Arms out
of the reach of the Common Law, and in these Matters he is commonly guided by
the Civil Law. Neither can any obtain a Coat of Arms, but he must first apply
himself to the Earl Marshal, to whom the Heralds College is subordinate.

The last is the Lord High Admiral of England; an Office held by Patent, and of
so great a Trust, that it has usually been given to Princes of the Royal Blood.

For the Lord High Admiral is Entrusted with no less than the Management of all
Maritime Affairs, with the Government of the King's Navy, with Power of
Decision in all Causes Maritime, as well Civil as Criminal, of all Things done
upon or beyond the Sea in any Part of the World, in all Ports and Havens, upon
the Seacoasts, and all Rivers below the first Bridge next toward the Sea. In
short, the Admiralty being in a manner a separate Kingdom from the rest, the
Lord High Admiral may be reputed at least the Viceroy thereof.

A Multitude of Officers high and low are under him, both at Sea and Land; some
of a Military, others of a Civil Capacity; some Judicial, others Ministerial.
And under him is held the High Court of Admiralty, the Places and Offices
whereof are in his Gift.

The last High Admiral of England was the late King, when Duke of York. For,
since he came to the Crown, the Office was executed by Seven Lords
Commissioners, as it is to this day.

CHAP. XIII.
Of Their present Majesty's, King WILLIAM and Queen MARY, With a brief Account
of Their Accession to the Crown.

KING WILLIAM, our present Monarch, is the only Issue of the late Illustrious
Prince William of Nassaw, Prince of Orange, and of the Deceased Princess Royal
Mary, eldest Daughter to King Charles I, who was wedded to the foresaid Prince
in the Year 1641.

His Majesty was born in Holland Nov. 4th 1650, ten days after his Fathers
Death; and was Christened by the Names of William Henry, William being his
Fathers Name, and Henry his Grandfathers.

The House of Nassaw is an Ancient and most Illustrious Family, so called from
Nassaw, a Town and County in Weteravia a Province of Germany. That Branch of it
from whence the King is descended had their usual Seat at Dillenburg, not far
from Nassaw, before they settled in the Low Countries; whence, for Distinctions
sake, they were named the Earls of Nassaw of the House of Dillenburg.

Otho of Nassaw, who died Anno 1190, was the Founder of the present Family of
the Princes of Orange; out of which descended Adolph, Earl of Nassaw, who was
chosen Emperor in the Year 1292. By the Marriage of Engelbert, the seventh
Earl of this House, with Mary Daughter and Heir of Philip Lord of Breda in
Brabant, that Town and Barony, with many other fair Estates in the Netherlands
was added to the Family. And by the Marriage of Henry (the tenth Earl of
Nassaw) Anno 1515. with Claude of Chalons, Sister and Heir of Philibert Prince
of Orange, this Principality, bordering upon Provence and Dauphene within the
Dominions of France, accrued to the Family. So much the worse for having so ill
an Neighbor as the present French King, who has long since rapaciously seized
upon it; but left however what he could not take away, the King's just Title to
it.

In short, our Gracious King William is the 18th Earl of Nassaw, beginning with
Otho aforesaid; and the 7th Prince of Orange of his Family, beginning with Rene
of Nassaw, Son of Henry and Claude, who succeeded Philibert his Uncle in the
Principality of Orange.

A Family as much honored for the personal Merit of the Princes of it as any
other in Europe, and to which the States of Holland ow the Liberty and
Greatness they enjoy. All the World knows how great a Patron and Assertor of
the Belgic Liberties against the Spaniard was the most noble and generous
Prince William of Nassaw, one of his Majestie^ Ancestors. And, to pass by the
generous Exploits of his noble Successors till the present King William, it is
well known what his Majestly has done to rescue, not only his Native Country,
but the best Part of Europe from its Oppressors.

It has been of late Years, both at home and abroad, the Maxim of some Princes,
to outvy each other in preying upon and destroying not only their Neighbors,
but their own Protestant Subjects, by all Methods of Perfidiousness and
Cruelty. To establish or maintain their Tyranny, they went about to introduce a
general Ignorance. For where Subjects part with their Reason, it is easy for
them to part with their Liberty; witness those miserable Inslaved Countries
where Popery domineers.

On the contrary the House of Orange has always appeared against that ravenous
and inhumane Principle. And, as if Providence had appointed them for a Check to
Tyranny, God has been pleased accordingly to bless their just Endeavors.

Never the Liberty of England, and the Protestant Interest in general, lay more
at stake than it did in the late Reign. It Is plain there was a general Design
to extirpate Herely in a Popish Sense, and to inslave all Europe. The Plot was
laid in the Reign of blessed King Charles, who with a show of Proteslantism
made the Way smooth for Popery. At last, when all Things were finely prepared
to the hand of his next Heir, King Charles go's off the Stage; and his Brother,
to play the last Act, enters, and ascends the Throne.

No Prince more Courteous, more Obliging, or more Promising at first than He
was to his new Subjects. The Church of England Triumphed in his Exaltation, and
Addressed Him from all Parts of the Kingdom, as their Tutela^ Angel. The People
in general looked upon him as an Incomparable Hero, who would quickly make it
his Business to pull down the Hector of France, and to carry the Glory of
England beyond all his Predecessors. In short, so great were the Hopes of this
King, that Edward III, and Henry V, the most glorious Monarchs of England, were
upon his Account to be hissed out of our English Chronicles.

No body dreamed of a Popish Catechism, to be the first step to this Glory, nor
of an Army to be raised for the defense of it. Under whose shelter, besides a
secret League with France, the Prerogative began presently to swell above its
Banks, the Laws to be Overwhelmed the Liberty and Property of the Subject
Invaded, the Church of England Crushed that had raised the King to the Throne,
Popery crowing over all the Nation, and to crown all their Hopes, presto, a
Prince of Wales. In short, to speak in terms of War, the Miner was fixed, and
we must either Surrender, or be Stormed.

This was our Condition, when the Prince of Orange (our present King) undertook
our Deliverance, and effected it, under God, in a miraculous manner. Upon whose
Approach our Mass-Hero fled, left us to shift for our selves, and the Popish
Party to the mercy of the Rabble. This happened Dec. 11th. 1688, a fatal Year in
this and the foregoing Age to Popery i^ England.

In that state of Anarchy, what could the Nation do less than provide for a
Settlement under the gracious Influences of the Prince. Which was accordingly
done, in as regular (...) Way as the present state of Affairs would ^ow.

King James having thus deserted the Go^ernment, nine and twenty of the Lords
Spi^^al and Temporal, such as ^^^ned to be at ^t time in and about the Cities
of London ^d Westminster, immediately assembled at ^ildhall, Where they
unanimously Re^^ved to apply themselves to His Highness (...) Prince of Orange,
and to assist Him ^^th their utmost Endeavors in the ob^^ing with all speed
such a free Parliament, (...) the security of our Laws, Liberties, and
^operties, as thereby the Church of England (...) particular, (with a due
Liberty to Prote^^nt Dissenters,) and in general the Protestant ^eligion and
Interest over the whole World ^ight be supported and encouraged, to the ^lory
of God, the Happiness of these King^oms, and the Advantage of all Princes and
^ates in Christendom. Whereof they made public Declaration, signed by every
one of (...) Lords; amongst which the Earl of Pem^ke, the Lord Viscount
Weymouth, the Bishop (...) Ely, and the Lord Culpeper, were chosen to ^tend
forthwith His Highness with the said ^eclaration, and at the same time acquaint
(...) with what they had further done at that ^eeting.

Few days after this, the Lord Mayor, Alder^en, and Commons of the City of
London in ^mmon Council Assembled, made an humble ^ddress to the Prince,
wherein they returned (...) Highness their Thanks for his glorious Un^rtaking
to rescue these Kingdoms from Po^ry and Slavery, looked upon him as their
Re^^e, implored his Protection, and humbly be^ght Him to repair to this City,
where he should be received with Universal Joy and S^tisfaction.

The Prince was then at Henley, where he r^ceived the Addressers in the most
obliging manner, with A^^rances of his Protection, a^ of his Readiness to
comply with their D^fires.

In the mean time King James was unhappi^ taken in a Disguise at Feversham in
Kent, as (...) was going for France. Where being soon D^ covered, he was at
last prevailed upon to Return; so that his Guards and Coach being se^ for Him,
he came back to Whitehall, Sund^^ Dec. 16, and reassumed the Government. While
King James came up to London from the South the Prince made his Way thither
from t^^ West, in hopes that his Majesty would come (...) an amicable and
equitable Accommodation by referring all Grievances to a free Parl^^ment.

But the King, not being able to bear the h^^ of a Free Parliament, after so
many notori^^ Violations of the Laws of the Realm, grew for uneasy at
Whitehall, and his Heart beat ag^ for France, as his only Place of Refuge.
(...) Rochester he goes, from whence few Days ^^ter he privately Withdrew
himself the sec^^ time; but with more success than the (...) For he got clear
to France, where the Qu^^ and the supposed Prince of Wales had so^ time before
taken Sanctuary.

Mean while the Prince of Orange was (...) to St. James's, Dec. 19th, where his
High^^ received the Compliments of all the Nobi^^ and other Persons of the
chiefest quality Town; and at Night the Streets were (...) with Bonfires, with
Ringing of Bells, and there public Demonstrations of Joy.

Then the Scene of Affairs was so very much ^ered, that nothing but a new
Settlement ^^uld Resettle us. In order to which a great Assembly of Lords and
Commons, Members of ^rmer Parliaments, besides the Lord Mayor, ^ldermen and
Common Council of the City of London, was held at Westminster, to consult that
was fit to be done. Who, after some De^^tes upon the present Juncture, came to
this resolve, that his Highness the Prince of O^^nge should be humbly Entreated
to Summon (...) Convention of Lords and Commons by his Cir^ular Letters (these
to be chosen by the People, in a Parliamentary Way) to meet at Westminster on
^he 22th. of January following; And that His sighness in the mean time would be
pleased ^o take upon Him the Administration of pub^ick Affairs both Civil and
Military, and the disposal of the public Revenue. Which was ^one accordingly.

The Convention being met at the Time ^ppointed, the House of Commons broke the
(...), Voted the Abdication of the Government by King James, and the Vacancy of
the ^^rone, that is in short, a Dissolution of the whole Frame of Government.
The House of Lords, being divided as to the Word Abdicate, ^^d several
Conferences about it with the Com^ons, till at last their Lordships Concurred
with them by Plurality of Votes. Which hap^ed on the 6th of Febr, the same Day
upon which King James had ascended the Throne.

The Government being thus declared in a ^ate of Dissolution, and the Throne
Vacant, ^he next Business was to Resettle the first by ^lling up the last. It
was then in their power (...) bestow the Crown upon whom they pleased. (...),
after several Debates, the Two Houses at last fully agreed upon a joint
Declaration concerning the Misgovernment of King James, the Offer of the Crown
to the Prince and Prince of Orange, the Abrogation of the Oaths of Allegiance
and Supremacy, and the new Oaths t^ be taken instead of them.

All this was done by the 12th of February upon which Day Her Royal Highness
the Princess of Orange arrived at Whitehall, about tw^ in the Afternoon; the
welcome News whereo^ was received with universal Demonstrations o^ Joy.

The next Day, Febr. 13th, both Houses being Assembled at Westminster, came to
the Banqueting House, where they presented t^ the Prince and Princess of Orange
the Instrument in Writing agreed upon for Declarin^ Their Highnesses KING and
QUEEN o^ England, France, and Ireland, with all the Dominions and Territories
thereunto belonging, and received Their Consent. Whereupon Their Majesty's were
immediately Proclaimed, in tha^ solemn Manner as I have already described i^
the Seventh Chapter.

And thus was accomplished the Curse of King James, J, (a Prince whose Learned
Pen baffle^ all the Conclave,) which he solemnly pronounced on any of his
Posterity that should turn Papists. I am heartily sorry that it should fall
(...) heavy upon the late King; but it is better so than that three Kingdoms
should perish.

And yet had he kept within some reasonable Bounds, and his Religion to
himself, without his open Violations of the Laws, as it were i^ defiance, it is
very likely the Nation would ha^^ been upon his account very indulgent to the
Roman Catholic Party. They might have g^ by this means some legal Toleration,
which (...) the space of few Years would have Incoura^^d and Strengthened their
Party here conside^bly. So quick of growth are the Roman ^atholicks, where they
find Incourage^ent.

Therefore the very Court of France did o^enly declare his Errors to the World,
and ^ssed this Verdict upon him, That his whole ^onduct had been very little
Judicious. The ^mperour on the other side, in his Letter to ^ing James, from
Vienna, Apr. 9. 1689, could ^^t forbear, amongst his tender condoling
^xpressions, to tell him the Cause of his ^in.

But King James would never be advised to Moderation, and no Counselors were
welcome (...) him but such as prompted him to Vio^nce. The Issue whereof proved
accordingly; ^ll Covet, all Lose.

I conclude with a Character of Their Ma^sties, a bold Thing I confess for my
Pen to ^^dertake; but such as I can make it, it may ^ake us the more sensible
of our Happi^ess.

The King is a Prince perhaps the best quali^ed for a Throne. He is Great
without Pride, ^rue to his Word, Wise in his Deliberations, ^ecret in his
Counsels, Generous in his At^^mpts, Undaunted in Dangers, Valiant with^^t
Cruelty, Unchanged under all Events. He ^ves Justice with Moderation,
Government without Tyranny, Religion without Persecu^^on, and Devotion without
Hypocrisy or Su^rstition.

How often has he exposed his Life through ^re and Sword for a sinking
Commonwealth, ^ll at last he rescued it from the open Violence of one King, and
the Undermining of another No Temptation could draw him away from (...)
generous Principle, nothing but true Greatne^ could make him Great.

To Save us here, when we were at the Brit^ of Ruin, designed for a Prey to
those two Inseparable Monsters, Popery and Slavery, He h^ventured his Life by
Sea and Land. By Sea (...) the worst Season of the Year, in the face (...) Two
great Monarchs his Professed Enemies, an^ upon an Element which at his first
setting o^ seemed to Declare against Him. By Land, h^ving a great Army to
oppose, many Hardshi^ to undergo, Uncertainties to struggle with, t^^ Romish
consecrated Daggers and Poison to p^vent. Undaunted he went through all; and
without shedding of Blood, restored of a su^den two languishing Nations.
France, the laughed at the Attempt, was amazed at the Success; and her
superfine Politics blushed (...) the sight of this.

But that which is admirable is to see a Prin^ of a Temper so even, as neither
to be dishea^ned with Hardships and Misfortunes, nor p^ up with Success. Always
the same, though ^^der various Circumstances; which is a tr^ Symptom of a great
Soul. Whereas Mutahi^ty is the proper Character of a mean a^cowardly Soul,
sometimes huffing, other tim^ sneaking; sometimes ready to tear his S^^jects to
pieces, at other times fawning upon them.

From those great Things His Majesty (...) done hitherto, one may guess at his
next ^^tempt, as soon as Ireland is reduced. The Fre^ King's Invasions and
Devastations, and his h^rid Persecution of his Protestant Subjects, (...)
things not to be forgotten. Manet alta mente ^^stum, and I am much mistaken if
the wild (...) at last don't meet with a Hercules. Che va ^^no va sano.

As for the Queen, She is the Glory of her ^ex; the fairest, and yet the best
natured ^incess in the World. Humble and affable in ^er Conversation, never
seen in any Passion, ^ways under a peculiar Sweetness of Temper. ^loved of her
Friends, admired by her Ene^ies. Moderate in her Pleasures, full of Zeal (...)
her Devotions, and of Charity toward People in Distress. A professed Enemy to
Idle^ess, and as great a Lover of Virtue and Know^dge. In a word, She is a
Princess of many ^^traordinary Virtues and Excellencies, without any appearance
of Vanity, or the least mix^^re of Vice.

So that we have, under this Government, ^^e fairest Prospect imaginable of a
suture Hap^iness. And, after several weak and inglorious ^eigns, we are like in
this (with Gods Bles^ing) if we be not wanting to our selves, to ^e once more
the Delight of our Friends, and (...) Terror to our Enemies.

CHAP. XIV.
The Unreasonableness of the Disaffected Party, under Their Majesty's Gracious
Government.

UNder our happy Circumstances of (...) gentle and easy Government, of seeing
our Laws and Property Restored, w^ want nothing but Union, to complete our
Happiness. But, instead of it, we have Men amongst us that are already sick of
it, some Churchmen, some Dissenters, besides the generality of Roman Catholics.

These indeed have the most reason to grumble; who, by losing King James, have
lo^^ their greatest Hopes. Yet, if they do seriously consider what Indulgence
they met with when they expected nothing but Vengeance they ought to rest
satisfied, and blush at their bloody Principles. What have they suffered for
all their Clamours, Threats, Insults, and Outrages, during the Reign of King
James Scarce a Man hurt amongst them, and but a few Houses pulled down by the
Rage of the Mobile, encouraged thereto by the Desertio^ of King James, when he
left us without an^ form of Government. Ever since they have enjoyed the same
Protection with the other Subjects of this Kingdom, whatever has bee^
maliciously suggested and published beyond Se^ to the contrary; and have been
no where (at least with Authority) hindered in their Devotions. So very
Indulgent the King has been hitherto to his greatest Enemies.

But, suppose King James had prevailed, they would have had indeed Popery
Triumphant, fine Processions, Monks in their proper Habits, and our Savior
walking the Streets in a Box. But what is all this to Property? A Belly full of
domineering Popery makes many an empty Belly, for Slavery always attends it.
The Church of Rome is an hungry Church, and the Princes of her Communion know
best how to squeeze their Subjects. Whilst they work upon the ^ody, she works
upon the Soul. They pull one way, she another; and so they divide the Spoil,
making a Prey of the People every where. Therefore, if the English Papists
understand their true Interest, as their Wise Ancestors did, they ought to
stand for the English Liberty, as ^ong as they can have any Indulgence in
matter of Religion.

But, besides the Roman Catholics, which are ^^deed the most excusable in this
Case, who ^ould have imagined that Protestants should be ^anable of lessening
themselves their own Hap^iness in this Change? And amongst them ^senters,
disgusted, but for what? Because (...) King has declared Himself particularly
for (...) Church of England. I bear a Love to Dis^^ters, as Christians, and
Protestants, and So^er People for the generality. But they cannot ^pect to be
blameless, as long as Envy and Re^nge (two Passions very opposite to
Conten^ness and Meekness) do so far possess some of ^^em, as never to be
pleased, till they get the ^^ff in their hands. Time was when they desired
thing more but the Liberty of Serving God in their Way, without Molestation.
This Liberty they got since this Change by Act of Parliament, with the ready
Concurrence of the Church of England Members, and the King's Assent to it; but
now it will not serve their turn. If nothing will please them but to see a Church
run down that stood alone at the Gap in the late Reign, that so learnedly
baffled all the Popish Writers, and was therefore by a Roman Decree to be
stripped of all, and destroyed, when the Dissenters were much in favor in that
Court, God forbid they should ever be pleased. The King knows who are the best
Friends to the Crown, and upon whom he may safely rely. He loves all his
Subjects, but perhaps not all alike.

The Mischief is, that some of our Churchmen are also out of Humor, or rather
out of order. One lies sick of a Scruple of Conscience, another languishes in
love with King James, a third is even distracted betwixt a King De Jure and a
King De Facto. But those Diseases (I thank God) are not so Epidemical, as to
endanger a Convulsion in the State. There are excellent and approved Remedies
for them in the Pastoral Letter of the present Bishop of Salisbury, and in the
Collection of Papers, but particularly in the late Book put out by that eminent
Divine Dr. Sherlock, to which for brevity sake I refer^ the Diseased. But, if
Reason cannot, Time (I hope) will wear out their Distempers. And so I bid them
Farewell.

CHAP. XV.
Of the present KING and QVEEN's Court.

THeir Majesty's Court is composed of two distinct Bodies, one of Laymen,
another of Churchmen. I shall begin with the first, not out of any Disrespect
to the second, but because this seems to me the most proper and natural Method.

The Court-Laymen are subdivided into two distinct Parts, Civil and Military.

But, before we descend to Particulars, it is to be observed,

I. That the Court, wherever it is, has within it self a certain Latitude of
Jurisdiction, called the Verge of the Court; which is every way within 12 miles
of the chief Tunnel of the Court, except London, which is exempted by Charter.

II. That the King's Court, or Palace where is Majesty resides, is counted so
sacred a Place, ^at not only Striking of any one there in ^assion is severely
forbidden, but also all Oc^asions of Striking. The first, by the ancient ^aws
of England, was punished with Death, ^^d Loss of Goods. And to this day,
who^^er presumes to strike another within the Pal^ce where the King's Person
resides, and does (...) draw blood by his Stroke, is liable, ^thout His
Majesty's Pardon, to lose his right Hand, to be Fined at the King's Will, and
ly in Prison till the Fine be paid. And, further to deter any one from
presuming to Strike in the King's Court, the Punishment for it is executed with
great Ceremony.

III. That, as great as the Court is, yet it falls much short of what it has
been formerly, whether we consider the prodigious Plenty the Court lived in, or
the Greatness of the Household. The Diminution whereof was first occasioned by
the Troubles in the Reign of Charles I, continued by Charles his Son and made
greater by the late King James. Before the Troubles aforesaid, this Court went
far beyond all others in Plenty and Magnificence, no less than 86 Tables being
kept here, furnished in all with about 500 Dishes each Meal, with all Things
suitable. A Profuseness (I confess) becoming the Times, when the English were
more addicted to Feasting, than they are at present.

But, to come to the present State of the Court, the King's Household is managed
in chief by these three principal Officers; whose respective Salaries I have
annexed. Viz.

Wages. Board-wages. The Lord Steward 100 00 00 1360 00 00 The Lord Chamberlain
-- 100 00 00 1100 00 00 The Master of the Horse. 1200 00 00

Under whom are almost all the King's Officers and Servants.

The Lord Steward is the Principal Officer o^ the King's Household. To whom the
State o^ the House is committed, to be ruled by hi^ Discretion, and all his
Commands in Court to be obeyed and observed. His Authority reaches over all
Officers and Servants of the King's House; except those of the King's Chamber,
the Stable, and the Chapel.

He is a White-Staff Officer, and the Whitestaff is taken for a Commission. In
the King's Presence he holds it up in his hand; and at other times, when he
goes abroad, it is carried by a Footman bare-headed. Upon the King's Death, he
breaks his Staff over the King's Hearse, and thereby discharges all
Court-Officers under him.

By his Office, without any Commission, he judges of all Treasons, Murders,
Felonies, and Bloudsheds committed in the Court, or within the Verge. Which is
much for the King's Honor, that where His Majesty is, no Justice should be
sought but immediately from his own Officers.

At the beginning of Parliaments he attends the King's Person, and at the end
he adjusts the Parliament Expenses, etc.

To take the Accounts for all Expenses of the King's Household there is a Place
at Court called the Compting-House.

And in this House is kept that ancient Court of Justice called the Green
Cloth, of a Green Cloth whereat the Court sits.

The Officers that sit in the Compting-House, and at the Board of Green Cloth,
with their respective Salaries, are,

Besides the Lord Steward in chief, Wages. Board-wages. The Treasurer and
Cofferer of the Household 223 14 08 The Comptroller 107 17 06 1092 02 06 The
Master of the Household 66 13 04 433 06 08 Two Clerks of the Green Cloth, and
Two Clerks Comptrollers, each 44 06 08 455 13 04

Amongst which the Lord Steward, the Treasurer, and the Comptroller are usually
of the King's Privy Council; and the two last are also White-Staff Officers.

Their Office in the Compting House is there to sit day by day, to take (as I
said before) the Accounts for all Expenses of the King's Household, to make
Provisions for it, to make the Payments, and such Orders as they think fit for
the Servants

In short, to Them is committed the Charge and Government of the King's House;
with Power to correct all the Servants therein that shall any way offend, and
to keep the Peace not only within it, but within the Verge of the Court. And,
whereas the King's Servants are free from Arrest, the Creditors of such as are
backward to pay have no other way for Payment, but to make their application to
the Board of Green Cloth, which upon hearing of the Matter, take care to see
Justice done to the Creditors.

In the Lord Steward's Absence, the Treasurer has power, with the Comptroller,
and Steward of the Marshalsea, (by virtue of their Office, and without
Commission) to hear and determine Treasons, Felonies, and other Crimes
committed within the King's Palace, and that by Verdict of the King's
Household. And, if any Servant within the Check-Roll be found guilty of Felony,
he is incapable of the Benefit of the Clergy.

The Comptroller's Office is to Comptrol the Accounts of the Green Cloth.

The Cofferer pays the Wages to the King's Servants, above and below Stairs;
and for the Household Provisions, according to the Allowance and Direction of
the Green Cloth. He has also a particular Charge and Oversight of the inferior
Officers of the King's House.

The Master of the Household surveys the Accounts of the House.

The Clerks of the Green Cloth sum up all Bills of Comptrolment, Parcels, and
Brievements. And the two Clerks Comptrollers do let and allow them.

But, besides the foresaid Officers belonging to the Compting House and Green
Cloth, there are inferior Officers and Servants, relating to the same. Viz.
Per Annum. Wages. Board-wages. Two Yeomen, each 05 00 00 73 00 00 Two Grooms,
each 02 13 04 54 15 00 A Messenger. 02 13 04 37 06 08

In the inferior Offices below Stairs, all under the Lord Steward, there is

In the Bake-house, A Clerk 06 13 04 73 06 08 Two Yeomen, each 05 00 00 45 00
00 Two Grooms, each 02 13 04 37 06 08 In the Pantry, Per Annum. Wages.
Board-wages. A Gentleman and Yeoman 11 08 01 48 11 10 A Yeoman Mouth to the
Queen 05 00 00 55 00 00 Three Grooms, each 02 13 04 37 06 08 In the Cellar, A
Sergeant 11 08 01 48 11 10 A Gentleman and Yeoman 11 08 01 48 11 10 A Yeoman

Grooms, each 05 00 00 45 00 00 A Yeoman Field to the King 05 00 00 45 00 00 A
Yeoman Field to the Queen 05 00 00 45 00 00 A Groom 02 13 04 37 06 08 In the
Buttery, A Gentleman and Yeoman 11 08 01 48 11 10 A Yeoman 05 00 00 45 00 00
Three Grooms, each 02 13 04 37 06 08 In the Spicery, Two joint Clerks, each 32

In each of the foresaid Offices it is the way to rise from a lower to a higher
Office; as from a Groom to become Yeoman, then Gentleman, then Sergeant, as one
happens to outlive them above him. And so the Clerks of the Particular Offices
have the Prospect of rising from one Office to a better, as the Vacancies
happen, as far as the Place of Cofferer.

So far we have gone through the Offices that are under the Lord Steward. Next
to whom is the Lord Chamberlain, also a White-Staff Officer; Who has the
Oversight of all Officers and Servants belonging to the King's Chamber, and
above Stairs. Except the Precincts of the King's Bed Chamber, which is wholly
under the Groom of the Stole.

He has also under his Charge the Officers both of the standing and removing
Wardrobes, the Heralds, Pursuivants, and Sergeants at Arms, the King's
Physicians, Surgeons, and Apothecaries, Barbers, the Revels, Music, Comedians,
Huntsmen, Messengers, and Tradesmen retained in the King's Service. And, which
is unusual in other Kingdoms, he has (though a Layman) the Oversight of the
Chaplains.

To him also belongs the Oversight of Charges of Coronations, Marriages,
Entries, Cavalcades, Funerals, and other like Solemnities; Of all Furniture in
the Parliament, and in the Rooms of Addresses to the King, etc.

He only has the Privilege of applying ^o his own Use some of the King's
Livery^en; being allowed one Coachman, Four footmen, and Six Grooms under the
King's Pay, and with his Livory, to attend his Service.

At any Solemn Cavalcade, he rides next behind the King, leading a Leer Horse

According to the late Establishment, commencing from the 1 of April 1689, the

Hunters, and Pads, and 42 Coach-Horses. Besides 12 Horses for the Ma^er of the
Horse, 4 for the Gentleman of the Horse, 2 Surgeon Horses, 2 Bottle-Horses, and
(...) Hunting Horses. In all 102.

Under the Master of the Horse there are these following Officers and Servants,
with their Salaries annexed. Viz. Per Annum. The Avener and Clerk Martial 260
00 00 Seven Querries, or Ecquerries, each 256 00 00 Three Pages of H^^^ur, each
156 00 00 A Sergeant of the Carriages, 86 00 00 A Master of the Studs, and
Surveyor of the Race, 82 00 00

They are Forty in Number, besides Of^ cers, all of them Gentlemen-born, at
lea^ ought so to be. And their Pay is 100 l. Yearly.

They wait half at a time Quarterly in the Presence Chamber, and with their
gilt Pole-Axes attend the King's Person to and from his Chapel Royal. But on
Christmas, Easter, and Whitsun-Days, All Saints, St. George's Feast, Coronation
Days, and other extraordinary Occasions, they are all obliged, under the
Penalty of the Checque, to give their Attendance.

On the Coronation-Day, and at St. George's Feast, they have the Honor to
carry up the King's Dinner. And at those times the King does usually confer the
Honor of Knighthood on two of them, such as the Captain presents to his
Majesty.

In Time of War they are bound to attend the King on Horseback, with
Cuirassiers Arms. And therefore each of them is obliged, even in Time of Peace,
to keep two Horses and a Servant, who is likewise to be armed; but the King
usually dispenses with this part of their Duty.

Their Standard born in Time of War, is A Cross Gules in a Field Argent.

They are not under the Lord Chamberlain, but only under their own Officers.
The chief whereof is the Captain, who is always a Nobleman of the Realm, or a
Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, whose Yearly Pay is 1000 l.

Next to whom is the Lieutenant, whose Yearly Pay is 500 l. The
Standard Bearer, 300 l. And the Clerk of the Checque, who is the Play Master of
the Band, 150 l.

By this Clerk all the Band and Officers, except the Captain) are Sworn, for
which ^e has a Fee of 5 l. 10 Shill. And it is his Office besides, to take
notice of those that are absent, when they should be upon their Duty.

To provide Lodgings for them, and to supply the Clerk in his absence, as his
Deputy, there is a Gentleman Harbinger, whose Fee is 70 l. Yearly.

In short, this Band of Pensioners is a Nursery to breed up young Gentlemen,
and fit them for Employments both Civil and Military, as well abroad as at home.

Next to them in the King's Palace, is another Body to guard their Majesty's.
Viz. the Yeomen of the Guard, who wait in the first Room above Stairs, called
the Gard-Chamber.

They were wont to be 200, of a larger Stature than ordinary, when every one of
them was to be six foot high. At present they are but 100, whereof 24 wait in
the Daytime, and 12 watch by Night. And, when the King or Queen goes abroad,
always a Party of them attend on Foot their Royal Persons; Some with Guns, and
others with Partisans, all with large Swords by their Sides. They, and the
Warders of the Tower, have a peculiar Habit; Viz. Scarlet Coats and Breeches,
both guarded with black Velvet, the Coats only down to the Knee, with Badges
upon them before and behind. Instead of Hats, they wear black Velvet Caps,
round and broad-crowned, according to the Mode in the Reign of Henry VIII.
Their Pay now (besides their Diet at Court when upon Duty) is not above 30 l. a
Yea^ which falls much short of what it has been formerly.

For their Officers they have a Captain, a Lieutenant, an Ensign, a Clerk of
the Checque, and four Exempts or Corporals.

The King and Queen, for their Guard abroad, have four Troops of Horse, three
English, and one Dutch, consisting each of 200, in all 800 Men, besides
Officers. A fine Body of Horse, for the most part composed of Gentlemen; well
mounted, armed, and equipped, and allowed 4 Shill. a Day.

These four Troops are all distinguished from each other by their different
Ribbons, Carbine Belts, Hooses, and Holster-caps, imbroidered with Their
Majesty's Cipher and Crown.

Each Troop is divided into four Divisions, two of which (making up 100 Horse)
mount the Guard, commanded by one principal Commissionated Officer, two
Brigadiers, and two Sub-Brigadiers. When the King or Queen goes abroad, either
in a Coach or Chair, a Party is sent from the Guard to attend their Persons.
But, when They are upon a Journey, then a Detachment is made out of the several
Troops.

Each Troop is commanded in chief by a Captain. Next to whom there are two
Lieutenants, a Cornet, a Guidon, four Exempts, four Brigadiers, an Adjutant,
who acts as Quartermaster, and four Sub-Brigadiers.

There is also to each Troop a Surgeon, a Clerk, one Kettle-Drummer, four
Trumpeters; and, for Divine Service, a Chaploin.

Now it is to be observed, that the Captains of Their Majesty's Troops of Gards,
always command by their Commission as eldest Colonels of Horse, the Lieutenants
as eldest Lieutenant Colonels of Horse, the Cornets and Guidons as eldest
Majors, the Exempts as Captains, and the Brigadiers, as Lieutenants.

As for the Adjutant and Sub-Brigadiers, they command not by Commission, but by
Warrant.

In case of Detachments, every Office precedes according to the Date of his
Commission. But, when several Troops march with their Colors, the Officer of
the eldest Troop commands those of equal Rank with him in the others, though
their Commissions be of elder Date.

The Pay of each Captain is 20 shill a Day, of a Lieutenant 15, of a Cornet 14,
of a Guidon 12, of each Exempt 12, of a Brigadier 10, of an Adjutant and
Sub-Brigadier twelve pence above the Pay of a private Trooper.

The Chaplain's Pay is 6 shill. 8 Pence a Day; the Surgeon's 6 shill. and two
more for his Chest-Horse; the Trumpeter's, and Kettle-Drum^er's, 5 shill.

According to the Muster-Roll, the Chaplain (...) listed next to the Guidon,
and the Surgeon ^ext to the Chaplain. Next to the Surgeon, he Exempts, and
Brigadiers; then the Audjment, and Sub-Brigadiers.

To each Troop of the Horse Gards there ha^ been added, few Years since, a
Company of Horse-Granadiers. Which consists of 60 Men, besides Officers, all
under the Command of the Captain of the Troop of Gards to whom they belong. And
their Pay is 2 shill, 6 pence a Day.

Their proper Commanders are 2 Lieutenants, 2 Sergeants, and 2 Corporals; the
Pay of a Lieucenant being 8 shill. a Day, of a Sergean^ 4, and of a Corporal 3.

In each Troop of Granadiers there is 4 H^boys, and 2 Drummers, their Pay being
each a shill. 6 pence a Day.

Next to the four Troops of Horse-Gards there is a Regiment of Horse, commonly
called the Oxford Regiment, because Commanded by the Earl of Oxford. It
consists of Nine Troops of 50 Men in each Troop. And the Colon^ hereof has
Precedencys next to the Captains o^ the Gards, before all other Colonels of
Horse whatsoever Change may be of the Colonel and all the Officers thereof.

In every Troop of this Regiment there is, besides the Captain, but one
Lieutenant, a Cornet, a Quartermaster, two Corporals, and two Trunpeters.

A Captain's Pay is 14 sh. a Day, a Lieutenants 10, a Cornet's 9, a
Quarter-Master's 6^ a Corporals 3, and each Trumpeter's 2 sh. 8 p. The Troopers
have but 2 shill. 6 pence each.

Lastly, there are three Regiments of Foot-Gar^ two English, and one Dutch; the
first and (...) consisting of above 2000 Men each, divided i^ 4 Battalions,
each Battalion into seven Co^^nies, of 80 Men each, besides Ossicers. Whereas
the second Regiment consists only of ^3 Companies, which make up 1000 Men.

The Colonel's Pay, as Colonel, is 12 sh. a Day; the Lieut. Colonel's; as such,
7 shill. the Major's, as Major, 5; the Adjutant's, 5; a Captain's, 8; a
Lieutenant's, 4; an Ensign's, 3; (...) Sergeant's, 1 sh. 6 pence; a Corporal's,
and Drummer's, 1 sh. a common Soldier's, 10 pence, and out of London but 8.

To each Battalion of the foresaid Regiments ^elongs a Company of Foot
Granadiers, of 80 ^en each; and the Dutch Regiment has be^^des a Company of
Cadets, or young French Gentlemen.

So much for the Civil and Military Part of their Majesty's Court, which
concerns the ^ody; I come now to the Ecclesiastic Part, which properly does
regard the Soul, and their future Happiness.

In order to which there is a Royal Chapel, besides the Kings Closet, or
private Oratory) ^r God's Servico and Worship. Where Prayers ^e read thrice a
Day, two Sermons preached very Sunday, besides other particular Times; ^e
Communion administered every first Sunday (...) the Month throughout the Year,
besides ^e great Festivals, and all Things performed ^th great Decency and
Order.

For the doing whereof, there is first a ^an of the Royal Chapel; who is
usually some ^ave learned Prelate, chosen by the King, and ^o (as Dean) owns no
Superior but the ^ng, For, as the Royal Palace is exempt ^m all inferior
Temporal Jurisdiction, so is (...) Chapel from all Spiritual. It Is a Regal
Peculiar, reserved to the Kings Visitation and immediate Government; who is
Supreme Ordinary, and as it were Prime Bishop over all the Churches and Bishops
of England.

Under the Dean there is a Sub-Dean, or Pracentor Capellae; and next to him 12
Priests. Whereof ones peculiar Office is to read the first Morning Prayers to
the Kings Household, to visit the Sick, to examine and prepare Communicants, and
to do all other Duties-proper for his Station.

Next to the Priests there are 20 Gentlemen, commonly called the Gentlemen (or
Clerks) of the Chapel; who, with the aforesaid Priests, perform in the Chapel
the Office of Divine Service in Praying, Singing, etc. And three of these are
chosen to be Organists. To whom, upon Sundays and Holy Days, is joined a
Consort of the Kings Music.

Moreover, for the Service of the Chapel, there are 12 Children in Ordinary,
who make up the Musical Choir. These are instructed in the Rules and Art of
Music by one of the ablest Clerks, who is allowed considerably for their Board
and his Teaching.

Here are also attending the Chapel, four Officers, called Vergers, from the
Silver. Rods which they carry in their Hands. The chief whereof is called a
Sergeant, the next two Ye^men, and the fourth Groom of the Chapel.

For the Preaching part, the King has no less than 48 Chaplains in Ordinary,
who are usually eminent Doctors in Divinity, and most Deans or Prebends. These
are under the particular Charge and Direction of the Lord Chamberlain, who
appoints them the Time for their Service at Court, being to wait four of them
together Monthly. But, besides those 48, there are always Supernumeraries; some
whereof wait by appointment in lieu of those, who, by reason of Sickness or
otherwise, cannot give their attendance.

And, as Lent is a particular Time of the Year for Devotion (tho it is not
observed in England with that Strictness and Superstition as it is in the Roman
States) so the Royal Chapel shows an excellent Example, at that time
especially, to all other Churches and Chapels of England.

In order to which the Lord Chamberlain, some time before Lent, does appoint
the Lent-Preachers, and causes a List of them to be printed, with their
respective Times for Preaching during Lent. Then the Sermon-Days are
Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, Weekly. The first Wednesday, being
Ash Wednesday, is fixed for the Dean of the Chapel to preach before the King;
and the Friday after for the Dean of S. Paul's. Each Wednesday after, one of
the Kings Chaplains is appointed to preach; every Friday, the Dean of some
Cathedral or Collegiate Church, and on Good Friday the Dean of Westminster.
Every Sunday, a Bishop; on Palm Sunday, an Archbishop; and Easter Day, the
Lord Almoner.

Upon Christmas, Easter, and Whitsunday, the King and. Queen do usually receive
the Holy Sacrament, only with some of the Royal Family, and two or three of the
principal Bishops.

Those are three Days of twelve in the Year, on which Their Majesty's, attended
with the principal Nobility adorned with their Colla^s of the Garter, together
with some of the Heralds in their rich Coats, make in a grave sodemn manner
their Offering of Gold at the Altar, which by the Dean of the Chapel is
distributed afterward among the Poor. The same is a Sum of Gold, to this day
called the Besant, or the Bizantine, from Bizantium the old Name of
Constantinople, where the piece of Gold was coined which anciently was Offered
by the Kings of England. The Gold to be offered is delivered to the King and
Queen by the Lord Steward, or some other of the principal Officers; and it is
Offered to God by Their Majesty's, as an Acknowledgement that by his Grace They
hold their Kingdoms of him.

The other Days of the Year on which they make the same Offering, are
All Saints, New Years Day, Candlemas, Annunciation, Ascension Day, S. John the
Baptist, and Michaelmas Day, when only Gold is offered. To which add Twelfth
Day, when Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh are Offered by the King in several
Purses.

The Lord Almoner is usually a Bishop. Whose Office is to dispose of the Moneys
allowed by the King for Alms, of all Deodands, and Goods of Self Murderers,
forfeited to the King, and always bestowed in Alms to the Poor. He has the
Privilege to give the King's Dish, that is, the first Dish at Dinner, which is
set upon the King's Table, to whatsoever Poor-man he pleases, or Money in lieu
thereof upon his Majesty's account. Wherever the Court resides, 24 Poor men are
nominated by the Officers of the adjacent Parish, among whom Money, Bread, and
Beer, or all Money, is equally divided at the Court Gate by the Lord Almoner
Order at 7 of the Clock every Morning. And it has been the Custom for every
Poor-man, before he received the Alms, to repeat the Cre^^ and the Lords
Prayer, in the presence of one of the King's Chaplains deputed by the Lord
Almoner. Besides, there are many poor Pensioners to the King and Queen below
Stairs, who have a Competency duly paid unto them by the Almoner. And, when the
King is in his Progress, his Lordship, or his Sub-Almoner for him, is to
scatter new-coined Two-pences in the Towns and Places where the King passes
through in his Progress, to a certain Sum by the Year* The Lord Almoner is to
see all these Things done; for the Performance whereof he has 3 Officers
allowed under him, to wit a Sub-Almoner, a Yeoman, and a Groom. And for that
purpose there is at Court a particular Office, from hence called the Almonry.

On Maundy Thursday, (being the Thursday before Easter) so called from the
French Mande a sort of Basket, is performed the Ceremony of Washing the Feet of
as many Poormen as the Years the King has reigned. Which is done sometimes by
the King himself, and in his absence by the Lord Almoner; a piece of Humility
taken from the Pattern of our Savior. When the Poor-mens Feet are washed, he
wipes them with a Towel. Then he gives every one of them for Clothing two
Yards and a half of Woollen-Cloth, Linen Cloth for Two Shirts, a pair of
Shoes, and a pair of Stockings. For Eating, six Peny-loaves of Bread, with 3
Dishes of Fish in Platters; whereof one of Salt Salmon, another of green Fish
or Cod, the third of pickle or red Herrings, or red Sprats. For Drink, a Gallon
of Beer, and a Quart bottle of Wine. And, for Pocket Money, a red-leather Purse,
with as many single Pence as the King is Years old; and, in such another Purse,
as many Shillings as the King has reigned Years. The Queen does also do the
like to diverse poor Women.

Lastly, the King has a Clerk of the Closet, who is commonly a reverend, sober,
and learned Divine. His Office is to attend at the King's right hand during
Divine Service, to resolve all Doubts concerning Spiritual Matters, and to wait
on his Majesty in his Closet or private Oratory.

The Dean of the Chappel's Fee is 200 l. Yearly, and a Table; the Sub-Dean's,
100; the Priests and Clerks of the Chapel, each 70 l.

The Lord Almoner has no Fee. The Sub-Almoner has but 6 l. 18. sh. a Year. But
the Yeoman has 30, and the Groom 20 l. a Year.

The Clerk of the Closet receives a Fee of 20 Nobles per Annum.

So far I have done with the King's Court, which the Queen, as His Royal
Consort, has a great share unto. And yet Her Majesty has her own Court besides
to Her self, consisting both of Men and Women, with a suitable Revenue to
support it. First she has Per Annum. A Lord Chamberlain 1200 00 00 A

CHAP. XVI.
Of their present Majesty's Land and Sea Forces, and the Management thereof.

THeir Majesty's Landforces are either Ordinary, as the Horse and Foot Guards,
the several Garrisons, and the standing Militia of the Country. Or
Extraordinary, as the present victorious Army in Ireland.

The Horse and Foot-Guards I have already described in the foregoing Account of
the King and Queens Court, where it appears they amount to 7000 Men at least.

The principal Garrisoned Places in England are Portsmouth, Plymouth, the Tower
of London, Windsor-Castle, Chester, Carlisle, Hull, Berwick, Dover-Castle, and
these two Forts on the Thames, Sheerness and Tilbury.

In the Isle of Wight there are constant Garrisons, at Cowes, Sandham Fort,
West-Yarmouth, and Carisbrook. So there is at Hurst and Calshot Castles, upon
two Points of Hampshire shooting forth into the Sea over against the said Isle.
To which add Upner Castle in Kent, Landguard Fort in Suffolk, Clifford Tower
and Scarborough Castle in Yorkshire, Tinmouth Castle in Northumberland, and
Holy Island near the Coast of that County, S. Mary's Castle among the Isles of
Scilly, Pendennis in Cornwall, and Portland Castle in Dorsetshire. Besides the
Islands of Jersey and Garnsey, on the Coast of Normandy.

The Number of Men in each of those Garrisons is uncertain; for it is greater
or lesser, as Occasion serves. Most of them are unregimented Companies.

These, together with the Royal Guards, being the standing Landforces in Their
Majesty's Pay, there is for the Paying of them, first a general Officer, called
the Play Master General, who has several Clerks under him.

Next is the Commissary General of the Musters, who has a Deputy Commissary in
London; besides eight other Deputy-Commissaries, who have their distinct
Circuits in the Country, for Mustering the Forces which lie in the several
Garrisons.

There is also a Secretary at War, with several Clerks, and a Messenger under
him.

Which three considerable Offices are kept at the Horse-Guard.

Moreover, there is a Judge Advocate, a Scout-Master General, an Adjutant
General, and a Marshal of the Horse; besides a Surgeon General.

Amongst Their Majesty's Land Forces we may reckon the Militia, or Train Bands
of every County, as being wholly at the King's Disposal, and bound to Assist
Him upon all Occasions within the Bounds of the Realm.

In Queen Elizabeth's Time a general Muster was made, by her Order, of all Men
able to bear Arms, from the Age of 16 to 60; who then amounted to three
Millions of Men, whereof six hundred Thousand fit for War. But, in Time of
Peace, the Matter is so regulated, that there is not above one hundred thousand
Horse and Foot actually Enrolled for the Defense of the Realm.

The Management whereof is in the hands of the Lord Lieutenants of the several
Counties of England, who are usually of the principal Rank amongst the Peers of
the Realm, chosen for that purpose by the King, and so created by his
Commission. They have Power by Act of Parliament to charge any Person with
Horse, Horsemen, and Arms, that has 500 l. a Year, or 6000 l. personal Estate;
and with a Foot Soldier, any Person that has 50 l. yearly Revenue, or 600 l.
personal Estate. Those that have meaner Estates are to join two or three
together, either to find a Horse and Horseman, or a Foot Soldier, according to
their Estates.

They have also Power to Arm, Array, and Form the Forces into Companies,
Troops, and Regiments, and to make their Officers by giving them Commissions;
and, upon any Rebellion or Invasion, to lead and employ the Men so Armed within
their respective Counties, or into any other County, as the King shall give
Order.

They name their Deputy Lieutenants, and present them to the King, for his
Confirmation. Who are to be of the principal Gentry of the Country, and have
the same Power as the Lord Lieutenant in his absence.

To find out Ammunition and other Necessaries, there is a Tax of 70000 l. a
Month upon the whole Kingdom, whereof the Lord Lieutenants or Deputies, or any
three (or more) of them, may levy a Fourth Part of each Man's Proportion in it.
And, when occasion shall be to bring the Militia into actual Service, the
Persons so charged are to provide each Soldier respectively with pay in hand
for a Month, at the rate of 2 shill. a Day for a Horseman, and 12 pence for a
Foot Soldier. For Repayment of which Money, and the satisfaction of the
Officers for their Pay, during the time aforesaid, Provision is to be made by
the King out of the public Revenue; and, till the same be actually performed,
none can be charged with another Months Pay.

These Forces are always to be in readiness, with all Things necessary at the
beat of Drum, or sound of Trumpet, to appear, muster, and be at certain times
trained and disciplined.

Now, to give speedy notice of an approaching Invasion, there are all over
England high Poles erected upon eminent Places both Inland and Maritime, with
Pitch-barrels fastened on the Top, known by the name of Beacons. Which being
set on fire, one by the sight of another, the whole Kingdom has thereby notice
in few Hours of the approaching Danger. Whereupon the Militia, to secure the
Kingdom, makes haste to the Seacoasts.

As for the present Army, which God has lately blessed with a glorious Victory,
carrying with it the Reduction of Ireland, and (I hope) a Fate upon France, it
was lately Computed to be near Fifty thousand strong, Horse, Foot, and
Dragoons; consisting of English, Irish, French, Danish, and Dutch Forces.

I wish, for the satisfaction of the Reader, that I could give a particular and
exact Account of this brave and gallant Army. But, rather than do it
imperfectly, I beg the Reader's leave to decline it.

And so I come to the Maritime Power of England. Which consists in general of
about 130 Men of War; besides Fireships, Yachts, Hulks, Ketches, Sloops, Hays,
and Smacks, and several other Vessels for Tenders and Victuallers.

The Men of War are divided into six Rates, or Ranks; Built in several Places,
but most at Woolwich, Chatham, Deptford, Blackwall, Harwich, and Portsmouth.

The following List gives you the Names of them, according to their Rates, in
the Alphabetick Order, with the Year when they were built; also the Number of
Tuns, Men, and Guns each of them commonly carries abroad in Time of War. Those
whose Names be in the Roman Letter, are the Thirty that were built by an Act of
Parliament made in the Year 1676.

To the foresaid Men of War add these Pri^es from Barbary, viz. the Two Lions,
the Golden Horse, the Half Moon, the Rose of Sally, and the Rose of Algier.
Besides Heldenberg, Dunbarton, etc. the first being Monmouth's, and the last
Argile's Ship.

As for Fireships, there is no certain Number of them. As Occasion serves, Ships
are bought for this Use, that have been otherwise Employed, few of them being
new built for this purpose. Some carry six, some twelve, most but eight Guns.

Yachts are a sort of Ships of great Use for Expedition, being built for quick
^ailing. They carry most of 'em 8 Guns, some but 4, with Men proportionably.
Their Majesty's have eighteen of these, according to the following List.

Yachts. Built An. Tuns. Men. Guns. Aun 61 100 30 8 Bezan 61 35 8 4 Catharine

There are moreover 7 Hulks, 2 Ketches, 12 Sloops, 3 Hoys, and 5 Smacks.

Five of the Hulks are Dutch Prizes, and the two other (viz. the America, and
the Arms of Horn) were bought. Amongst which the Alphin carries 4 Guns, the
America 20, the Arms of Horn 8, the Arms of Rotterdam 7, the Elias 2, the
Slothony 7, and the Stadthouse 4.

The two Ketches are the Deptford, carrying 4 Guns; and the Quaker 10.

The Sloops carry all 4 Guns each; the Hoys and Smacks, none.

Now, as to our Men of War in particular, it is to be observed, that for
Strength they are Incomparable, being built of English Timber, which is the
most excellent for that purpose. For Beauty they yield to none, being so
proportionably and spaciously built, so curiously and richly adorned, that they
seem so many Royal Palaces amongst other Ships at Sea. And for Sailing, they
are so well Contrived, that the French took their Model from us; and, for ought
I know, were Complimented to it by the late King Charles.

The Royal Sovereign, amongst the rest, being a first Rate Ship, carries 1605
Tuns, 815 Men, and 100 Guns. Her Length is 131 foot, Breadth 48, Depth 49, and
Draught of Water 23 and an half. She has 18 Masts and Yards, the Main Mast 130
foot long, and 38 inches diameter; the Main Yard to it 105 foot long, and 23
inches Diameter; and the Main-Top, 15 foot diameter. Her greatest Sail, called
Main-Course (together with the Bonnet) contains 1640 Yards of Ipswich Canvas
double.

She has six Anchors, the biggest weighing 6000 pounds, and the least 4300. Of
fourteen ^ables that belong to them, the greatest being 21 inches in compass,
weighs 6000 pound, and the least 8 inches in compass weighs 1300.

Her Guns, all of brass, are disposed of in three Tire; viz. in the upper Tire
44, in the second 34, and the lower Tire 22.

She carries a long Boat of 50 foot, a Pinnace of 36, and a Skiff 27 foot long.

The Britannia, a new Ship, is much the same; but that she was not perhaps so
carefully built as the Royal Sovereign, there being found lately some Defect in
the Timber, which is now repairing.

As to the Charge of Building so great a Vessel, together with Guns, Tackle,
and Rigging, besides Victualling, it is computed at least to 60000 pound.
Whereby the Reader may judge of other Ships proportionably. And, for every
Month that a first Rate Ship is at Sea, it stands the King in 3500 l. for
Victuals, Ammunition, Wages, Wear and Tear.

For Manning of their Majesty's Fleet, England is provided with a vast Number
of able and stout Seamen, who are looked upon as the chiefest Bulwark of the
Nation. Whom the King by his Prerogative, may press for his Service; as he may
Merchants Ships, upon an urgent Occasion.

And, for a constant Supply of Men for their Majesty's Service by Sea and Land,
the Kin^ has lately raised two Marine Regiments, ea^^ consisting of 1800 Men.
Which is to be (...) standing Nursery for Men to be bred up i^ Maritime
Affairs, in order to serve the Kin^ and their Country either by Sea or Land, as
Occasion shall require. They wear blue Coats a^^ Caps, with the figure of an
Anchor in the forepart of the Cap. And their Pay is to each 1 l. 16 sh. a
Month, besides their Diet whilst they are on Shipboard.

For the Command of a Man of War, there is first a Captain, and a Lieutenant,
whose Pay is thus by the Day. Only it is to be observed, that in a sixth Rate
Ship the Captain is only called Master.

1 Rate. 2 Rate. 3 Rate. s. d s. d. s. d. Capt. 15 00 12 00 10 00 Lieut. 03 00
03 00 02 06 4 Rate. 5 Rate. 6 Rate. Capt. 07 06 06 00 05 00 Lieut. 02 06

The Lieutenants of the fifth and sixth Rate Ships are paid by the Month, and
so are all others belonging to the Ships.

Now you must know, that in the several Rates, there is a Proportion greater or
lesser of some sort of Officers. As in a first Rate Ship, 6 Master's Mates and
Pilots, in a second 4, and in a third 3, in a fourth and fifth 2, in a sixth 1.

Quarter Masters, 4 in all Rates, except the fifth and sixth, which have but 2
each.

Quarter-Master's Mates, 4 in the first and second Rates, 2 in the third and
fourth, 1 in the fifth and sixth.

Boatswains Mates, 2 in the first, and but 1 in ^he rest.

Yeomen of Sheets, 4 in the first and second Rates, 2 in the third and fourth,
that is in each of them.

Gunners Mates, 2 in the first and second, and but 1 in each of the rest.

Quarter-Gunners, 4 in the first, second, and third, 1 in each of the rest.

Carpenters-Mates, 2 in the first and second, 1 in each of the rest.

Ordinary or Crew, 9 in the first, 6 in the second, 4 in the third, 3 in the
fourth, 1 in each of the fifth and sixth.

Midshipmen, 8 in the first, 6 in the second, 4 in the third, 3 in the fourth,
2 in the fifth, and 1 in the sixth.

For the Building, Repairing, and Cleaning of their Majesty's Ships, there are
six great Yards, where they are usually laid up; Viz. Chatham, Deptsord,
Woolwich, Harwich, Sheerness, and Portsmouth. Fitted with several Docks,
Wharfs, Lanches, and Graving places; always furnished with great Quantities of
Timber, and other Materials; having convenient Storehouses, with vast
Quantities of Cables, Rigging, Sails, Blocks and other sorts of Stores; with
great Rope-Yards to make Cables, and all sorts of Cordage for the Navy.

In those Yards are employed diverse Officers, the principal whereof are as
follow, with their Yearly Salaries. Viz. l. A Clerk of the Checque 245 A
Store-Keeper 260 A Master Attendant 124 His Assistant 80 A Master Shipwright
133 His Assistants, each 70 Clerk of the Survey 160

Note, that the Charges of the Clerks and In^^ruments are included in their
Salaries.

All these are under the Direction and Management of the Navy Office, kept in
the Crouched Friars, London. Where the whole Business concerning the King's
Ships is managed by four principal Officers, and four Commissioners of the
Navy, besides other Commissioners for Victualling the Navy.

The four principal Officers are the Treasurer, C^mptroller, Surveyor, and
Clerk of the Acts.

The Treasurer's Office is to pay the Charges of the Navy out of the Exchequer,
having first a Warrant for the Money from the Lords Commissioners of the
Treasury, and for the Payment thereof another Warrant from the principal
Officers of the Navy. His Allowance is 3000 l. a Year.

The Comptroller's Office is to attend and comptroll all Payments of Wages. He
is likewise to know all the M^rket Rates of all Stores for Shipping, to audit
and examine all Treasurers, Victuallers, and Store-Keepers Accounts. His Salary
is 500 l. per Annum; and his Assistants 400.

The Surveyor's Business is to know the state of all Stores, and see their
Wants supplied; to survey the Hulls, Masts, and Yards, and have their Defects
repaired at reasonable rates. What Stores the Boatswains and Carpenters receive
in order to a Voyage, he is to charge them with by Indenture; and at their
return, to state and audit their Accounts. His Salary is 400 l. a Year.

The Clerk of the Acts is to record all Orders, Contracts, Bills, Warrants,
etc. relating to the Navy; and his Salary is 500 l. pen Annum.

Amongst the four Commissioners, one's Province is to Comptroll the
Victualler's Accounts; another's, the Accounts of the Store-keepers of the
Yards; and the two others have the managing of Their Majesty's Navy, the one at
Chatham, and the other at Portsmouth. The Salary of each is 500 l.

Both the principal Officers and Commissioners hold their Places by Patent,
under the Great Seal of England; and have Clerks allowed to each of them, with
respective Salaries, for the Dispatch of Business.

The Commissioners for Victualling the Navy are commonly four, and their Salary
is each 400 l. a Year.

Lastly, the Navy-Office is subordinate to the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty, as they execute the Office of the Lord High Admiral of England; of
whose Power and great Privileges I have already spoken amongst the Great
Officers of the Crown.

For transacting of Maritime Affairs, they keep a Court, called the Court of
Admiralty, of which in my Third Part. By virtue of their Place, they appoint in
diverse Parts of the Kingdom several Vice-Admirals, with their Judges and
Marshals by Patent, under the Great Seal of the High Court of Admiralty. Now
there are 17 of these Vice-Admiralties in England, besides 2 in Wales Those in
England are Chester Parts. Cornwall North Parts Cornwall South Parts Devonshire
Dorset Durham, Northum, berland, Westworland, and Cumberland. Essex Gloucester
Kent Lancaster Lincoln Norfolk Somerset Southampton, or Hampshire Suffolk
Sussex York


In Wales there is but two Vice-Admiralties, one in the North, and the other in
the South Parts of Wales.

To reflect upon what is past relating to our Naval Force, this (I confess) was
much weakened by the late King Charles his strange Neglect of Shipping and
Seamen, to the great discredit and damage of this Nation. Then, and not till
then, the French grew upon us; and grew (like a Weed) so fast, that they have
been ever since a great Discouragement and Obstruction to our English Trade. To
see those Sea-Mushrooms, the French, dare be so bold as to crow over the
English, who would not have Employed them for Swabbers some Years since, 'twere
enough to inrage a sensible Nation. But, if one may guess at future Events from
the present Disposition of Things, I am apt to think this prodigious
Gallicinium, or Crowing of the French King, is a Presage of his Fall. And,
without Inquiring into the secret Causes of the late unusual and wonderful
Tameness of our Fleet, (which gave him the satisfaction to rove a while
undisturbed in our Seas) now such Measures are taken as will in all probability
make him lower his Top-sail. As for Tourville his Admiral's Exploit at
Ting^nouth, it is such as deserves Derision, more than a Triumph. Tingmouth, a
small, open, and obscure Place, the Resort of a few Fishermen who had there
some Thatched Houses, was wonderfully Stormed, and irresistibly Burnt by this
Victorious Fleet. Which, flushed with this great Expedition, and its happy
Come-off in the Seafight, sailed few Days after with flying Colors for Breast.
Breast, which expected great Spoils from the British Shore, and some Return for
Millions expended to make this proud Appearance at Sea, wondered to see nothing
but their Fleet come short home; some Ships wanting, and others halting, with
part of what Men they had left alive half starved, or sick to death, as if they
had come from Terra Incognita. But the Paris Gazette made amends, which
celebrated this Expedition at that rate, that one would have thought the
Venetians Victory over the Turks in the Gulf of Lepanto fell short of this
paultry one. And, to raise the Credit of the great Exploit at Tingmouth, there
Tingmouth was represented as a flourishing Harbor, crowded with Men of War,
and Merchant Ships richly laden, of which a Sacrifice was made to the new
French Neptune. Thus, by a false and pompous Relation (which indeed sounded
much to the glory of a Hamlet) the French Court designed to amuse the World, to
raise on the one side the Spirits of the drooping French, and at the same time
strike an Aw amongst the Confederates. Which shows what shifts the French are
put to in this Juncture of Time, to support their Reputation.

What remains is to give an Account of Their Majesty's Office of Ordnance,
relating to their Forces both by Sea and Land, and Kept within the Tower of
London. Which Office concerns all the principal Preparatives and Instruments of
War for the Defense and Safety of the Kingdom, and has the ordering and
disposing of all the Magazines, as well for Sea as Land.

The principal of these Magazines is the Tower, where there are Arms for 60000
Men, and a fine Train of Artillery Kept, with all stores proportionable.

This, and all other Magazines in the Kingdom (as those of Portsmouth,
Plymouth, Windsor-Castle, etc.) are under the Master-General of the Ordnance, a
Place of great Trust, and of a general Influence over all the Kingdom. Under
whom there are Six principal Officers, and others subordinate, all holding
their Places by Patent under the great Seal.

The principal Officers are The Lieutenant General. The Surveyor. The Clerk of
the Ordnance. The Keeper of the Stores. The Clerk of the Deliveries. The
Treasurer, or Play Master.


The Lieutenant of the Ordinance receives at the Board, with the rest of the
principal Officers, all Orders from the Master General, and is to see them duly
executed. In the Master General's Absence, he may make Orders upon Occasion,
for Things that are not of that high Importance as to require the King's or the
Lord High Admiral's Warrants. He is to see the Train of Artillery, and all its
Equipage, fitted for Motion upon any Occasion. And from him ^ssue Orders for
the discharging the great Guns, when required, upon Coronation-Days, Festivals,
Triumphs, and the like.

The Surveyor's Office is to survey all Their Majesty's Ordnance and Stores in
the Store-Keeper's Custody, and to see them placed to the best advantage. He is
likewise to Keep Checque upon all Laborers and Artificers Works, to see that
all Stores brought in be good and serviceable, and to allow all Bills of Debt.

The Clerk of the Ordnance records all Patents and Grants relating to the
Office, with the Names of all concerned therein. Also, all Instructions and
Orders sent from the King to the Office, or from the Office abroad; with such
Letters, Instructions, Commissions, Deputations, and Contracts as are for His
Majesty's Service. He draws all Estimates for Provisions and Supplies to be
made, makes all Bills of Impressed and Debenturs for Work done, or Provisions
received, and Keeps Quarter-Books for the Salaries and Allowances of all
Persons belonging to the Office. He likewise Keeps Journals of the Receipts,
Delivery, and Returns of the King's Stores; which serves as a Checque between
the two Accounts of the Office, the one for Money, and the other for Stores.

The Keeper of the Stores has in his particular Charge all the Ordnance and
Stores. For the safe Keeping whereof, and giving a true Account from time to
time, he must give good Security. He is to see that all the Kings Storehouses
be well Accommodated, and Kept i^ good Repair, and the Stores kept in such
O^der and Luster as becomes the Service and Honor of His Majesty. He is bound
not to receive any Provisions but such as have been (...) Surveyed by the
Surveyor, and proved by the Proof-Masters. Nor is he to issue any part of the
Ordnance, Munition, or Stores, but what is agreed upon, and signed by the
Officers, according to the appointment of the Master of the Ordnance, by the
Kings Order, or six of the Privy Council; and, if it be for the Use of the
Navy, by the Lord Admiral's (or the Commissioner's) Warrant. Neither is he to
receive back any Stores formerly issued, till they have been reviewed by the
Surveyor, and registered in the Book of the Remains.

The Clerk of the Deliveries draws up all Orders and Proportions for delivering
any Stores or Provisions at any of Their Majesty's Magazines, and is to see the
same duly executed. And, for the better discharging of the Store-Keeper, he is
by Indenture or Receipt to charge the particular Receiver of the Stores, and to
register both the Warrants for Deliveries and the Proportions delivered.

The Treasurer, or Play Master, makes the Payments of all the Salaries and Bills
of Debt; but so that no Money is to be by him allowed to any Person, without
being listed, or appointed to be paid by the Master General under his hand. So
that, except Salaries, all the Money of the whole Office goes toward Building,
Buying in of Stores, Fortifications, and the like; and all this Money runs
through the Pay-Master's hands.

Amongst the Subordinate Officers we may reckon in the first place the Master
Gunner of England. Who is to show the best of his Skill to all that are
employed in Gunnery in Their Majesty's Service; and, at each ones Admittance,
to administer unto him an Oath, which binds him not to serve any foreign Prince
or State, without Leave, and not to teach any Man the Art of Gunnery but what
has taken the said Oath. And, before any one can be actually employed as Their
Majesty's Gunner, the said Master must be so well satisfied with his Skill, as
to Certify to the Master of the Ordnance his Sufficiency and Ability to
discharge the Duty of a Gunner.

Here is also a Principal Engineer, to whom are subordinate all the King's
other Engineers. Most of whom have their Salaries and Allowances out of this
Office, from whence they receive their particular Orders and Instructions,
according to the King's Pleasure signified unto them by the Master of the
Ordnance.

The Keeper of the small Guns is another Officer relating hereunto. Who has the
Charge and Custody of their Majesty's small Guns, as Muskets, Carabines,
Pistols, etc. with their Furnitures.

I pass by a great Number of inferior Men employed in this Office; as the
Under-Clerks, the Proof-Masters, Messenger, and great many Artificers, such as
the Master Gun-smith, the Furbisher, the Master Smith, the Master Carpenter,
Master Wheel-Wright, and others.

CHAP. XVII.
Of Their Majesty's present Revenues, and the Management thereof.

THE present public Revenues of the King and Queen, as they were lately
settled by King and Parliament, differ in several Points from the Settlement
made in the Reign of Charles II, and Confirmed to the late King James.

It Is true, the Excise (which consists in certain Impositions upon Beer, Ale,
and other Liquors) is Settled upon Them for their Lives, and the Life of the
Survivor of Them. But out of it a Yearly Rent of 20000 l. comes to Her Royal
Highness, the Princess of Denmark, and her Issue, during Their Majesty's Lives,
and the Survivor of Them.

The Custom upon Commodities Imported and Exported, which was settled upon King
Charles II, and afterward his Successor, for their respective Lives, is now
Confined within the Term of four Years, to commence on the 24th Day of December
1690. And that great Branch of the Revenue, the Hearth-Mony, which was for ever
Settled in the Crown, to the great Grievance of the People, is now lopt off by
Act of Parliament, upon the King's generous Motion, for the Relief of His
Subjects.

As to Their Majesty's other Revenues, I refer you to the Ninth Chapter.

Which, with the Excise and Custom, come to above Twelve hundred thousand Pound
a Year, that is about 16 Millions of French Livers. A Revenue which may serve
in Time of Peace to Keep up the Honor of the Crown, not to enable any
Ambitious (or Over-covetous) Prince to Invade the Property and Liberty of the
Engglish Subjects, or under a vain Pretense of his own Glory to disturb the
Peace and Quiet of his Neighbors. A sad Experience whereof we have seen of
late Years by the Practice of that Ambitious Monarch, the French King; whose
exorbitant Incomes have helped him to Crush first his Subjects, and then most
of his Neighbors.

But, when the Nation is concerned in a foreign War, and the War grounded upon
Equity and Honor, the Parliaments of England seldom fail of Supplying the King
with Subsidies suitable to the present Occasion, by a Land Tax, Poll-Mony, and
such other Ways as they think most convenient.

In the mean time, as the Custom and Excise are the two principal Branches of
Their Majesty's Revenues, let us see how the same are managed, how the Products
thereof come into the Exchequer, and are there disposed of by such thrifty
Methods, that (all Charges born) it costs the King little above 2 Shillings in
the Pound.

For the Managing of the Custom-Revenue, there are in the first place at
present Seven Commissioners, who have the Charge and Oversight of all Their
Majesty's Customs in all Ports of England. Which Customs amount to about 600000
l. a Year, whereof the Port of London only pays two Thirds, that is about
400000 l. Yearly

The said Commissioners sit day by day at the Custom-House, London, They hold
their Places by Patent from the King, and have each a Salary of 1000 l. per
Annum.

Under these are a great Number of Officers employed, both at London and in the
Out-Ports, some of them of considerable quality and ability. Such as
Collectors, Customers, Comptrollers, Surveyors, Registers, Searchers, Waiters.
etc. whose due Perquisites are so considerable, that to some they are more than
their respective Salaries. First there is A Collector Inwards, and for the Act
of Navigation 966 13 04 A Collector Outward 276 00 00 A Customer of the Cloth,
and petty Customs 277 06 08 Two Customers of the great Customs, each 50 00 00 A
Comptroller General of the the Accounts 500 00 00 A Comptroller of the Cloth,
and petty Customs 100 00 00 A Surveyor General 500 00 00 A Surveyor of the
Out-Ports 250 00 00 A Register of the Seizures 106 00 00 A Head-Searcher 120 00
00 Nineteen King's Waiters, each 52 00 00 Forty Land-Waiters, each 80 00 00

There is also a Secretary, a Ware-house-Keeper, a Surveyor of the Warehouse,
7 Land-Surveyors, 8 Tide-Surveyors, 7 Under-Searchers, (these at 12 l. per
Annum.) and many more Officers that I pass by for brevities sake. Besides
several Persons Commissioned to seize Uncustomed Goods, either Inward or
Outward bound; 80 Tide-Waiters, whose Fee is each 5 l. a Year, and 3 shill. a
Day; besides extraordinary Tide-Waiters, allowed no Salary, but only 3 shill. a
Day, when Employed. To which add Noon-Tenders, Watchmen, and abundance of other
inferior Officers.

The Excise Office is Kept in a stately House in Broad Street; where this
Revenue is also managed by Seven Commissioners, who receive here the whole
Product of the Excise all over England, and pay it into the Exchequer. They
have each of them 1000 l. Salary per Annum, and are obliged by Oath to take no
Fee nor Reward but from the King only. Under these is A Register and Secretary
500 00 00 An Auditor, who for himself and Clerks is allowed 700 00 00 A
Comptroller, and his Clerks 1240 00 00

There are other considerable Places belonging to this Office, both within
Doors and without, which are enjoyed and officiated by very sufficient Persons.
Particularly the House-Keeper's Place, worth 400 l. per Annum. And, to collect
the Excise-Duty all over the Kingdom, a great Number of Men appointed for that
purpose, whose Salary is 20 shill. a Week.

But it is Observable, that from the foresaid Commissioners there lies an Appeal
to five others, called the Commissioners of Appeal, whose yearly Salary from
the King is 200 l. each.

These, and all other Their Majesty's Revenues, are paid at Westminster into
the Exchequer, that Ocean of Treasure, which receives all those Streams, and
returns them again to refresh the Kingdom by the constant Payments out of it.
Whereby is caused a great Circulation of Money, throughout the Land.

And, as there are a great many Officers for Collecting the King's Revenues, so
there are not a few to Receive and Disburse the same, according to His
Majesty's Order.

The principal Officer is the Lord Treasurer, One of the Great Officers of the
Crown. Whose Place is sometimes, as it is at this present, managed by
Commissioners, appointed by His Majesty.

The next is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, an Officer of great Account and
Authority; whose Power extends not only in the Exchequer Court, but also here,
in the managing and disposing of the King's Revenue. He is Under-Treasurer, has
the Exchequer-Seal in his Custody, and a Superintendency over the Lord
Treasurer's Roll. The Places of the Comptroller of the Pipe, of the Clerk of
the Pleas, the Clerk of the Nichils, and the two Praisers of the Court, besides
the Seal thereof, are all in his Gift.

Then there are two Chamberlains, who (...) in their Custody many ancient
Records the Standards of Moneys, Weights, and (...), and Doomsday Book,
otherwise called (...) Book of the Exchequer. First Known by the Name of
Rotulus Wintoniae, and since named Doomsday Book, as containing an exact
account of all the Lands of England, with the true Value of them, and their
Owners Names. So that when this Book was opened upon any Difference, the Cheat
appeared, and Judgment was given accordingly. This Tax-book has been written
above 600 Years ago, viz. in the Reign of William the Conqueror, and was six
Years a making. The same is Kept under three Locks and Keys, not to be looked
into under 6 s. 8 d. and for every Line transcribed is to be paid 4 d.

Under the two Chamberlains are their Deputies, who sit in the Tally-Court,
where they examine the Tallies; and there is also a Tally^utter attending, this
Way of Tallies being found by long experience to be absolutely the best Way to
avoid all Cozenage in the Kings Revenue. Which is after this manner;

He that pays any Moneys into the Exchequer receives for his Acquittance a
Tally, that is, a stick with Words written on it on both sides, containing the
Acquittance proper to express what the Money received is for. This being cloven
asunder by the Deputy-Chamberlains, the Stock is delivered to the Party that
paid the Money, the Counter-stock (or Counter-foil) remaining with them. Who
afterward deliver it over to other Deputies to be Kept till it be called for,
and joined with the Stock. After which they send it by an Officer of their own
to the Pipe, to be applied to the Discharge of the Accomptant.

Next to the two Chamberlains is the Auditor of the Receipts, who files the
Bills of the Tellers, whereby they charge themselves with all the Moneys
received, and upon the Lord High Treasurer's Warrant, or the Lords High
Commissioners, draws all Orders to be signed by him or them, for Issuing forth
all Moneys by virtue of Privy Seals. Which Orders are recorded by the Clerk of
the Pells, and are entered and lodged in the said Auditor's Office. He also, by
Warrant of the Lord Treasurer or Commissioners, makes Debenturs to the several
Persons, who have Fees, Annuities, or Pensions by Letters Patents from the King
out of the Exchequer, and directs them for Payment to the Tellers. He daily
receives the state of each Teller's Account, and weekly certifies the Whole to
the Lord High-Treasurer or Lords Commissioners, who immediately present the
Balance to the King. Twice a Year, viz. at Lady Day and Michaelmas, he makes
an Abstract of all Accounts made in the preceding Half-Year, whereof he
delivers a Copy to the Lord Treasurer, and another to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. He keeps the several Registers, appointed for paying all Persons in
course, upon several Branches of the Kings Revenue. Lastly, he has five Clerks,
to manage under him the estate of Moneys received, disbursed, and remaining.

Next, there are four Tellers; whose Office is to receive all Moneys due to the
King. And, though their Salary from the King be small and inconsiderable, yet
they are bound to His Majesty in 20000 l. Security, and Keep each of them two
Clerks, who constantly attend their Offices.

There is moreover a Clerk of the Pells, so called from Pellis a Skin, his
Office being to enter every Teller's Bill into a Parchment Skin. He has two
Clerks under him, one for Incomes, the other for Issue.

Lastly, there are three Ushers of the Receipt, a Tally-cutter, and four
Messengers. The Ushers Office is to see the Exchequer secured Day and Night,
and to find Paper, Books, etc. for the Use of the Exchequer.

It Is observable, that in case of a Gift from the King, or Pension out of his
Exchequer, he that receives it pays but 5 l. per Cent. amongst all the
Officers. And out of public Payments, as for the Navy, Ordnance, Wardrobe,
Mint, etc. there goes not amongst them so much as 5 s. per Cent.

On the other side, for Moneys paid in by any of the King's Tenants, it costs
them at the most but 3 s. for every Payment under a thousand pounds; and that
goes only to the Clerks for their Pains in writing and attending.

CHAP. XVIII.
Of the Queen Dowager, the Princess Ann of Denmark, Prince George, and the Duke
of Gloucester.

QUeen Catharine, the Widow of the late King Charles, and now the third Person
in the Kingdom, is the only Sister of Pedro, the present King of Portugal.
Where she was born, Nov. 14th, 1638; and marrried to the late King Charles, in
the Year 1662.

The Portion she brought with her was about 300000 pounds Sterling, besides
Tangier in the Streights upon the Coast of Africa, and the Isle of Bombay near
Goa in the East Indies. To which was added a Privilege for any Subjects of
England to Trade freely in the East and West India Plantations belonging to the
Portugueze.

Her Majesty's Jointure, by the Articles of Marriage is 30000 pound a Year. To
which King Charles added 10000 l. more, which he settled on her Majesty for her
Life.

So that the Queen Dowager has 40000 pound a Year, wherewith she keeps a Court
suitable to Her Majesty.

The Princess Ann of Denmark, second Daughter to the late King James, and only
Sister to our Gracious Queen Mary, was born in Febr. 1664. And July 28th 1683
(being S. Anns Day) she was married to the Illustrious Prince George, the only
Brother to Christiern V, the present King of Denmark.

His Royal Highness was born at Copenhagen, the chief City of Denmark, in April
1653. At 15 Years of age he began his Travels into Holland, England, France,
and Italy, which lasted about two Years. Being 20 Years old, in the Year 1673,
he traveled into Germany, where he saw the Imperial and the French Armies near
the Rhine. Anno 1675, his Royal Highness served in the War against the Swedes,
and was at the taking of Wismar. The next Year he commanded a part of the
Danish Army at the Battle of Lunden in Schonen, against the King of Sweden. And
in the Year 1677, he commanded again a part of the Danish Army at the famous
Battle of landscroon, where he signalized his Valor. Afterward His Royal
Highness made several Voyages into Germany, and continued some Years abroad.
And, after his Return into Copenhagen, the Treaty of Marriage with Him and the
Lady Ann being set on foot, was happily brought to Conclusion. By which Treaty
His Royal Highness is declared to be received as one of the Princes of the
Blood Royal of England; all his Officers and Servants to be from time to time
appointed by and with the Approbation of the King of England; and his Revenue
coming from Denmark to be 17500 pounds sterling Yearly, which is a great
Revenue in that Country. The Princesse^ Portion is 30000 l. a Year, to be paid
by the King. To which 20000 l. per Annum being lately superadded, and payable
out of the Excise, the whole Yearly Revenue of the Prince and Princess amounts
to 67500 l. sterling. Wherewith they Keep a Court suitable to their Royal
Highnesses.

The Prince has four Sisters. The first married to John George, the present
Elector of Saxony. The second, to Christian Adolph, Duke of Holstein Gottorp.
The third, to the late Elector Palatine of the Rhine, who died without Issue.
And the fourth, to the present King of Sweden, Charles XI.

His Brother, the present King of Denmark, has three Sons, and two Daughters.
The eldest Son is Frederick, the Heir apparent, born in the Year 1671; and the
two others are Christiern, and Carolus.

The Duke of Gloucester is the only Son and Heir of their Royal Highnesses the
Prince and Princess of Denmark. He was born July 24th, 1689, and on the 27th he
was Christened at Hampton Court by the Lord Bishop of London, and named
William; the King, and the Earl of Dorset Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's
Household, being Godfathers, and the Lady Marchioness of Hallifax Godmother.

CHAP. XIX.
Of the Nobility of England.

THE English Nobility is divided into five Degrees. Viz. Duke, Marquess, Earl,
Viscount, and Baron.


And they are called the Peerage of England, because they are all Peers; the
Barons as well as the rest. They have also, all of them, the Title of Lord.

All these Honors are given by the King, who is the sole Fountain of Honor;
and whatever Title a Subject of England receives from any foreign Prince is not
only Insignificant here, but Unwarrantable by Law.

All Noblemen at their Creation have two Ensigns, which signify two Duties.
Their Heads are adorned, in token that they are to assist their King and
Country with good Counsel in time of Peace; and they are girt with a Sword, as
being to support the King and defend the Kingdom with their Lives and Fortunes
in time of War.

A Duke is created by Patent, Cincture o^ Sword, Mantle of State, Imposition of
A Cap and Coronet of gold on his head, and a Verg^ of gold put into his hand. A
Marquess and a^ Earl, by Cincture of Sword, a Mantle of State, with a Cap and
Coronet put upon him by the King himself; and a Patent delivered into his hand.
Viscounts and Barons are made by Patent, and these sometimes by Writ, whereby
they are called to sit in the House of Lords.

All the Peers have Coronets, but with these Distinctions. A Baron has six
Pearls upon the Circle; a Viscount, the Circle of Pearls without number; an
Earl has the Pearls raised upon Points, and Leaves low between; a Marquess, a
Pearl and a Strawberry-leaf round, of equal height; and a Duke, Leaves without
Pearls. Only the Dukes of the Royal Blood bear (like the Prince of Wales) a
Coronet of Crosses and Flower de Luce. Which is the same with the King's,
excepting the Arches, Globe, and Cross on the top of the King's Crown.

But the greatest Distinction amongst the Nobles is their Parliament Robes, in
their several Gards on their Mantles, and short Cloaks about their Shoulders.
For a Baron has but two Gards, a Viscount two and a half, an Earl three, a
Marquess three and a half, and a Duke four. Besides that the Mantle of a Duke,
Marquess, and Earl is faced with Ermine; that of a Viscount and Baron with
plain white Furr.

Dukes were at first so called a ducendo, being anciently Generals and Leaders
of Armies in time of War. Marquesses, from their Government of Marches, and
Frontire-Countries. Earls, in Latin Comites, because they had the Government
of Counties. Viscounts, in Latin Vice-Comites, as being Assistants or Deputies
in the Government of Counties. Barons, according to Bracton, quasi Robur Belli;
the safety of the King and People, in Time of War, depending upon their Courage
and Skill in Martial Affairs.

Anciently a Duke was made so for Term of Life, then held by Lands and Fees;
till Dukes came to be Titular and Hereditary. In those Times likewise there was
no Earl but had a County or Shire for his Earldom; who, for the support of his
State, had the third Penny out of the Sheriffs Court, issuing out of all Pleas
of that County whereof he was Earl. Also, those Barons only were accounted
Peers of the Realm, that held of the King per integram Baroniam, which
consisted of 13 Knights Fees, and one third part, that is of 400 Marks, each
Knights Fee being 20 l. And whoever had so much was wont to be summoned to
Parliament. But then 100 Marks was as much as 2000 pounds at this day, as may
be guessed by comparing the Prices of Things. It Is true King Henry III, after
he had with much ado suppressed his Barons, called by Writ unto Parliament only
such great Men as had continued loyal, or were like so to be. Which Example
being followed by his Successors, they only were accounted Peers of the Realm
that were so called by the King's special Writ. Till Barons came to be made by
Patent, as well as by Writ; and at last most by Patent, which makes it
hereditary.

But there are Barons in England, that have no^ share in the Peerage, as such;
viz. the Barons of the Exchequer, and the Barons of the Cinque Ports Such as
these the Earls Palatines, and the Eath of England Marches, had anciently under
them and such there are yet in Cheshire. The chie^ Burgesses of London were
also called of o^ Barons.

All Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls at this day have their respective Titles from
some Shire, or part of a Shire, Town or City, Castle, Park, or Village. Except
two Earls, whereof one is Officiary, and the other Nominal; the first being the
Earl Marshal of England, and the last the Earl Rivers, who takes his
Denomination from an Illustrious Family.

Barons are so denominated from their chief Seat, or a Castle belonging to the
Family. Which is not to be divided amongst Daughters, if there be no Sons; but
must descend to the eldest Daughter.

None of these Honors can be lost but these two Ways. Either by want of Issue
male, except where the Patent extends to Issue female, as sometimes it does. Or
else by some heinous Crime; and then it cannot be restored to the Blood, but by
Act of Parliament.

A Duke has the Title of Grace given him; and the other Peers, that of Lordship
on Honor. Accordingly we commonly give to these the Epithet of Right
Honorable.

All Dukes and Marquesses Sons, are called Lords by the Courtesy of England,
and the Daughters Ladies. I say by the Courtesy of England; for the Law makes
no such Distinction, but looks upon all as Commoners that have no Right to sit
in the House of Peers. Of an Earl none but the eldest Son is called Lord,
though all the Daughters be Ladies. And, as for the Issue of Vicounts and
Barons, none of their Sons is Lord, nor of the Daughters Lady.

A Dukes eldest Son is called Lord Marquess; and the younger Sons by their
Christen-names, with the Title of Lord prefixed, as Lord William, Lord Thomas,
etc.

A Marquesses eldest Son is called Lord of a Place; and the younger Sons, as
those of a Duke, that is by their Christen-names with the Title of Lord
prefixed, as Lord William, Lord Thomas.

An Earl's eldest Son is born as a Viscount, and called Lord of a Place.

In point of Precedence, this is the Rule. Afthe Princes of the Blood, the
first amongst the Nobility are the Dukes, and these are thus followed. Viz.
Dukes. Marquesses. Dukes eldest Sons. Earls. Marquesses eldest Sons. Dukes
younger Sons. Vicounts. Earls eldest Sons. Marquesses younger Sons. Barons.
Vicounts eldest Sons. Earls younger Sons. Barons eldest Sons. Vicounts younger
Sons. Barons younger Sons.


But it is to be observed, that all Dukes that are not Princes of the Blood are
preceded by these four Great Officers of the Crown, though they be but Barons;
viz. the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord President of the Privy
Council, and the Lord Privy Seal. I leave out the Lord High Steward of England,
because none of this Office is continued beyond the present Occasion.

As for the Lord Great Chamberlain of England, the Lord High Constable, the
Lord Marshal, the Lord High Admiral, the Lord Steward of the King's Household,
and the Lord Chamberlain of the King's Household, they sit above all of their
Degree only.

The Nobility of England have at all times enjoyed many considerable
Privileges.

Though neither Civil nor Common Law allow any Testimony to be valid but what
is given upon Oath, yet the Testimony of a Peer of England, given in upon his
Honor, without any oath, is esteemed valid. And, whereas the law allows any
one of the Commonalty arraigned for Treason or Felony to challenge 35 of his
Jury without showing Cause, and others by showing Cause; a Peer of the Realm
cannot challenge any of his Jury, or put any of them to their Oath, the Law
presuming that they being Peers of the Realm, and judging upon their Honor,
cannot be guilty of Falsehood, Favor, or Malice.

In Criminal Causes a Peer cannot be tried but by a Jury of the Peers of the
Realm; who are not, as other Juries, to be put to their Oath, but their Verdict
given in upon their Honor suffices.

All Peers of the Realm being looked upon as the King's constant Counselors,
their Persons are at all Times privileged from Arrests, except in Criminal
Cases. Therefore a Peer cannot be Outlawed in any Civil Action, and no
Attachment lies against him. The only Way for satisfaction from a Peer is by
Execution taken forth upon his Lands and Goods, and not by Attachment, or
Imprisonment of his Person.

So tender is the Law of the Honor, Credit, Reputation, and Persons of
Noblemen, that there is a Statute on purpose, called Scandalum Magnatum, to
punish all such as by false Reports ^ring any scandal upon them.

They are exempted from all Attendance at Leets, or Sheriffs Turns, where
others are obliged to take the Oath of Allegiance. And, whereas, for the
suppressing of Riots, the Sheriff may raise the Posse Comitatus; yet he cannot
command any Peer of the Realm to attend that Service.

In Civil Causes, they are not to be Impanelled upon any Jury or Inquest de
facto, though in a Matter between two Peers; and, if a Peer be returned upon
any such Jury, there lies a special Writ for his Discharge.

They are, upon no Case, to be bound to their good Behavior, or put to swear
they will not break the Peace; but only to promise it upon their Honor, which
was ever counted so sacred as upon no terms to be violated.

Every Peer of the Realm summoned to Parliament may constitute, in his lawful
absence, a Proxy to Vote for him; which none of the Commons may do. And any
Peer in a Place of Trust is free to make a Deputy, to act in his absence,
whilst he attends the Person of the King.

Where a Peer of the Realm is Defendant, no Day of Grace is to be granted to
the Plaintiff; the Law presuming, that a Peer of the Realm must always be ready
to attend the Person of the King, and the Service of the Commonwealth Therefore
he ought not to be delayed any longer than the ordinary Use of the Court, but
t^ have expedition of Justice.

In any Civil Trial, where a Peer of the Real^ is Plaintiff or Defendant, there
must be at leas^ one Knight returned of the Jury. Otherwis^ the Array may be
quashed by Challenge.

In all Cases wherein the Privilege of the Clergy is allowed to other Men, and
in diverse Cases where that Privilege is taken away from them, a Peer of the
Realm, upon his Request, shall be for the first time adjudged as a Clerk
Convict, though he cannot read. And that without burning in the Hand, loss of
Inheritance, or Corruption of Blood.

In case of Amerciaments of the Peers of the Realm upon Non-Suits, or other
Judgments, a Duke is to be amerced but Ten Pounds, and all others under Five.
This to be done by their Peers, according to Magna Charta; though it has been
often done of late by the King's Justices.

A Peer of the Realm, being sent for by the King to Court, Parliament, Council,
or Chancery, has the Privilege, passing by the King's Park or Forest, both
coming and returning, to Kill one or two Deer. An Earl has 8 Tun of Wine
Custom-free, and the rest proportionably.

All Peers of the Realm have a Privilege of Qualifying a certain Number of
Chaplains, to hold Plurality of Benefices, with Cure of Souls. But it must be
with a Dispensation first obtained from the Archbishop, and the same ratified
under the Great Seal of England. Thus a Duke may qualify six Chaplains, a
Marquess and Earl five, a Viscount four, and a Baron ^hree.

A Peer of the Realm has also the Privilege ^f Retaining six Aliens, whereas
another may ^ot Retain above four.

These are the chief Privileges belonging to ^e Nobility of England, which are
great and ^onsiderable. And yet none of them ever had the Privilege of the
Grandees of Spain, to be covered in the King's Presence, except Henry Ratcliff,
Earl of Surrey. It Is true the Princes of the Blood have often had the honor of
being covered, but then it was by the King's gracious Command, not by virtue of
any constant Privilege.

Neither are our Noblemen exempted, as in France, from Tailles and
Contributions; but always bear a share proportionable. And, in case of a
Poll-Act, they are usually thus Rated, according to their several Degrees of
Honor. Viz. l. s. d. A Duke 50 00 00 A Marquess 40 00 00 An Earl 30 00 00 A
Viscount 25 00 00 A Baron 20 00 00

Those of their Sons which have attained to 16 Years of Age are thus taxed. As.
l. s. d. The Eldest Son of A Duke 30 00 00 The Eldest Son of A Marquess 25 00
00 The Eldest Son of An Earl 20 00 00 The Eldest Son of A Viscount 17 00 00 The
Eldest Son of A Baron 15 00 00 A Younger Son of A Duke 25 00 00 A Younger Son
of A Marquess 20 00 00 A Younger Son of An Earl 15 00 00 A Younger Son of A
Viscount 13 06 00 A Younger Son of A Baron 12 00 00

The Nobles to bear up their Rank, have generally great and plentiful Estates,
some of them beyond those of several Princes beyond Sea. And, till the Civil
Wars in the Reign of Charles I. they lived with suitable splendor and
Magnisicence; Keeping a plentiful Table, and a numerous Attendance, with
several Officers; delighting in noble Exercises, and appearing abroad according
to their Rank and Quality. Honor and Integrity, Justice and Sobriety, Courage
and Wisdom, were Virtues they excelled in. A Lord's House was then looked upon
as a well disciplined Court, where Servants lived not only in Plenty, but in
great Order, with the Opportunity of getting good Breeding, and the Prospect of
raising themselves in the World by their Lords Bountifulness and innate
Generosity. How far the Case is altered, it is but too plain. Yet it is hoped, a
virtuous and generous Prince will bring back that Golden Age.

But there is an additional Honor, the most ancient Order of the Garter,
wherein some of the chief of our Nobility have ever had a share, since its
first Institution. The Founder of this Order was that warlike and potent
Prince, King Edward III, who several times triumphed over France and Scotland.
Polydore Virgil gives it a slight Original; but his Grounds by his own
Confession, grew from the vulgar Opinion. Which is, that Edward III, having
obtained many great Victories (King John of France, and David Bruce of Scotland
being both his Prisoners, King Henry of Castille the Bastard expulsed, and Don
Pedro restored by Edward the Black Prince) did upon no weighty Occasion first
erect this Order, Anno 1350. Who dancing with the Queen, and other Ladies of
the Court, took up a Garter that happened to fall from one of them. Whereat some
of the Lords smiling, the King said, that e're it were long he would make that
Garter to be of high Reputation, and shortly after instituted this Order. A
very unlikely Thing, that so noble an Order should be raised on so mean a
Foundation.

Whereas, according to Cambden, and several others, the Institution of this
Order by the foresaid King Edward was upon his good success in a Skirmish,
wherein the King's Garter was used for a Token. The Order first Instituted by
the Name of the Order of S. George, the Patron of England, and of this Order in
particular. And, because the Garter was the only part of the whole Habit of the
Order, made choice of at first to be constantly worn, it came in process of
Time to be called the Order of the Garter.

The same consists of a Sovereign (which is always the King of England) and 25
Companions, called Knights of the Garter; some of them Princes of other
Countries, and the rest Noblemen of this Kingdom. And it is observed, that there
have been of this Order, since the Institution, no less than 8 Emperors, and
27 or 28 foreign Kings, besides many Sovereign Princes of a lower Rank.

The Garter, to be daily worn upon the left Leg by the Companions of this
Order, is a blue Garter decked with Gold, Pearl, and precious Stones, and a
Buckle of gold. They are not to be seen abroad without it, upon pain of paying
two Crowns to any Officer of the Order who shall first claim it. Only upon a
Journey a blue Ribbon may serve instead of it.

The Meaning of the Garter is, to put the Companions of the Order in mind,
that, as by this Order they were joined in a firm League of Amity and Concord,
so by their Garter, as by a fast Tie of Affection, they are obliged to love one
another. Now, to prevent an ill Construction of it, King Edward commanded these
French Words to be fixed upon it, Honi soit qui mal y pense, that is, Shame be
to him that thinks evil of it. And it was done in France, because England being
then possessed of a great Part of France, the French Tongue was the usual
Language in the King of England's Court.

Besides the Garter, the honorable Companions are to wear at Installations and
high Feasts, a Surcoat, a Mantle, a high black Velvet Cap, a Collar of pure
gold, with other stately and magnificent Apparel. The Collar composed of Roses
enamelled Red, within a Garter enamelled Blue, with the usual Motto in Letters
of gold, and between each of these Garters a Knot with Tassels of gold.

By an Order made April 1626, they are to wear on the left side of their Upper
Garment (whether Cloak or Coat) an Escutcheon of the Arms of S. George, that
is, the Cross of England incirled with the Garter and Motto, from whence round
about are cast Beams of Silver, like the Rays of the Sun in full luster, which
is commonly called the Star.

To this Order belongs a College, seated in the Castle of Windsor, with S.
George's Chapel there erected by King Edward, and the Chapterhouse. The
College, being a Corporation, has a great Seal, and several Officers belonging
to it.

The principal of these is the Prelate of the Garter, which Office is settled
on the Bishopric of Winchester. Next, the Chanceliour of the Garter, the
Bishop of Salisbury for the time being. A Register, the Dean of Windsor.
Garter, the principal King at Arms, who manages and marshals their Solemnities
at their Installations and Feasts. And lastly, the Usher of the Garter, who is
also the Usher of the Black-Rod.

To the Chapel there belongs 14 Secular Canons, and 13 Vicars, all Priests.
Besides 26 poor Knights, maintained by this College, for their Prayers to the
Honor of God, and S. George.

The Solemnity of this Order is performed yearly on S. George's Day, the 23th
of April. As for the Orders and Constitutions belonging to this Society,
touching the Solemnities in making these Knights, their Duties after Creation,
and their high Privileges, they are too long to be inserted here.

CHAP. XX.
Of the Gentry of England.

NExt to the Nobility, which is looked upon as the Flower of the Kingdom, let us
take a View of the English Gentry, called by some the lesser (or lower)
Nobility, and Keeping a middle Rank betwixt the Nobles and the Common People.
Of these there are three Degrees; Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen.

We have now but three sorts of Knights in England, besides the Knights of the
Garter. Viz. Baronets, Knights of the Bath, and Knights Batchelours.

The Degree of Baronets is the next to Barons, and the only Degree of
Knighthood that is Hereditary. An Honor first Instituted by King James I, Anno
1611, conferred by a Patent upon a Man, and his Heirs Males of his Body
lawfully begotten. The Purchase of it does commonly arise, Fees and all, to
1200 l. the Purchaser being to pay, besides the Fees, as much Money as will pay
for 3 Years 30 Foot-Souldiers at 8 pence a Day, to serve in the Province of
Ulster in Ireland. Therefore they have the Privilege to bear in a Canton of
their Coat of Arms, or in a whole Scutcheon, the Arms of ^lster, viz. in a
Field Argent a Hand Gules. In the King's Armies, they have place in the gross
near the King's Standard. And for their Funerals they have also particular
Privileges.

The whole Number of them, by the first Institution; is not to exceed 200 at
one and the same time. After which Number completed, as any one for want of
Heirs come to be extinct, the Number is not to be made up by new Creations, but
be suffered to diminish, as appears by their Patent. And yet the very Founder,
King James I, transgressed the first his Rule, by creating 203. Charles, his
next Successor, made 455. But King Charles II, outdid them both, by creating
near upon 900 during his Reign. At this time there are reckoned above 700
living.

Sir Nicholas Bacon of Suffolk was the first Baronet created, whose Successor
is therefore styled Primus Baronettorum Angliae.

No Honor is ever to be created between Barons and Baronets.

As for the other two Degrees of Knighthood, they are but Personal, and not
Hereditary; so that the Honor dies with the Person Knighted, and descends not
to his Son.

Knights of the Bath are so called, from their Bathing the Night before the
Creation within the Lists of the Bath. The first of this sort were made by
Henry IV; but now they are usually made at the Coronation of a King or Queen,
or Creation of a Prince of Wales.

They wear a Scarlet Ribbon Belt-wise; and take place of Knights Batchelours,
but come after Baronets. There are but a few Knights of this Order.

Knights Batchelours are the lowest sort of Knights, and the most common.
Anciently this Degree was in greater esteem than it is at the present, when it
was only conferred upon Swordmen for their military Service, who from the Gilt
Spurs usually put upon them were called in Latin Equites Aurati. Whereas now a
days this Honor is also bestowed upon Gown-men, viz. Lawyers and Physicians.
And all the Ceremony used in their Creation is their Kneeling down before the
King, and His Majesty's lightly touching them on the shoulder with a naked
Sword.

Anciently there was another Sort of Knights now disused, I mean the Knights
Bannerets, who were Knighted in the Field. This Order was accounted very
honorable, had the precedence of the Knights of the Bath, and bore their Arms
with Supporters, which was not allowed to any under this Degree.

Next to Knights are the Esquires, so called from the French Escuyer, this from
the Latin Scutiger; which Name was given of old to him that attended a Knight
in time of War, and carried his Shield. Whereas Esquire with us is a mere Title
of Dignity next to and below a Knight, and signifies a Gentleman, or one that
bears Arms as a Testimony of his Nobility and Gentry.

They who by right claim this Title now are all the younger Sons of Noblemen;
and, by the Common Law of England, their very eldest Sons are Esquires, and no
more. Next are the Esquires of the King's Body, the eldest Sons of Noblemens
younger Sons, Knights eldest Sons, and their elder Sons for ever. Next,
Esquires created by the King, by putting about their Necks a Collar of S's, and
bestowing on them a pair of Silver Spurs.

Those that are reputed, or looked upon as equal to Esquires, tho none of them
be really so, are several Magistrates, and Officers in the King's Court; as
Judges, Sergeants at Law, Sheriffs, Mayors, Justices of the Peace, Counselors
at Law, and the principal Commanders of an Army. So Heads of Houses in the
Universities, Doctors of Law, Physic, and Music, usually take place next to
Knights, and before ordinary Gentlemen.

Lastly, Gentlemen are properly such as are descended of a good Family, bearing
a Coat of Arms, without any particular Title. And these we call Gentlemen born.

But Use has so far stretched the signification of this Word, both high and
low, that every Nobleman, nay the King himself, may be called a Gentleman. And,
on the other side, any one that, without a Coat of Arms, has either a liberal,
or genteel Education, that looks Gentleman-like (whether he be so, or not) and
has wherewithal to live freely and handsomely, is by the Courtesy of England
usually called a Gentleman. Others, by their Offices, are looked upon as such;
particularly most of the King's Menial Servants, and the principal Officers in
Noble-mens Families, etc. The Military Profession, which has been always
counted Noble, seems to give the very meanest Professors of it a Title to this
Quality. But it is more particularly adapted to two distinct Bodies of the
King's Guards; the one called Gentlemen Pensioners, who guard his Person within
Doors; and the other the Gentlem^n of the Guard, by whom is meant his Body of
Horse Guards, who guard the Kings Person on horseback without Doors.

As in Germany all Noblemens, so in England all Gentlemen's Arms descend to all
the Sons alike. Only the eldest Son bears Arms without difference, which the
younger may not.

Besides above 700 Knights Baronets, and the few Knights of the Bath, there are
reckoned to this day above 1400 ordinary Knights, and 6000 Esquires and
Gentlemen; whose younger Brothers in all may make up at least 12000 all over
England. And the Land in the Possession of them all has been computed to amount
at least to four Millions yearly.

The Law of England, which is so Favorable to the Nobility, has not a
proportionable Regard for the Gentry. For, whether they be Knights, Esquires,
or Gentlemen, they are all reckoned by law, even Noblemens Sons, amongst the
Commons of England. So that the eldest Son of a Duke, though by the Courtesy of
England styled an Earl, shall be Arraigned (if charged with a Crime) by the
Title of Esquire only, and tried by a Jury of Common Freeholders. In
Parliament he can sit only in the House of Commons, if elected, unless he be
called by the King's Writ to the House of Lords.

Knights are distinguished in England by the Title of Sir prefixed to their
Christen names. And Gentlemen have no other Title but that of Master when
spoken of; and that of Sir, when spoken to. But, if one writes to an Esquire,
the Direction ought to be thus, as To Thomas Whitfield Esquire.

The Epithet of Honorable is usually given to any Knight, Esquire, or
Gentleman, distinguished by some eminent and personal Worth.

CHAP. XXI.
Of the Commonalty of England.

BY the Commonalty I mean Yeomen, Merchants, Artificers, Tradesmen, Mariners,
and all others getting their Livelihood after a Mechanic Way.

Yeomen are such amongst the Commonalty who having Land of their own to a good
value, Keep it in their own hands, husband it themselves, and live with their
Families upon it. They are therefore by the Law called Freeholders, because
they hold Lands or Tenements Inheritable by a perpetual Right to them and their
Heirs for ever. Their Number is great in England, and many of them have Estates
fit for Gentlemen. Forty or Fifty pounds a Year is ve^^^ordinary, 100 or 200 l.
a Year in some Counties is not rare, in Kent there are those who have 1000 l.
and some more per Annum. Which is not easy to be found amongst Men of this Rank
any where else in Europe.

And, whereas Husbandry is commonly looked upon as the most innocent Life, and
the freest from the Corruption and Cheats that attend other Professions,
therefore the Law of England has a better Opinion of the Yeomanry that occupy
Lands, than of Tradesmen or Artificers. And accordingly Yeomen are capable of
bearing some Offices, as of Constable, and Churchwarden, to serve upon Juries,
to be Train-Souldiers, to vote in the Election of Knights of the Shire to serve
in Parliament, etc. And, by the Statutes of England, certain Immunities are
given to Freeholders and Land-men, tho they are not Gentlemen.

Next to Freeholders are the Copyholders, who are much of the same nature. I
mean those Copyholders, that hold Copy-holds certain. Which is a kind of
Inheritance, in many Places called Customary; because the Tenant dying, and the
Hold being void, the next of Blood, paying the Customary Fine (as two Shillings
for an Acre, or such like) may not be denied his Admission. They are called
Copyholders, from the Copy of Court-Roll of the Manor within which they hold
their Land, by which Copy only they hold it. For this is all a Copyholder has
to show for his Title, which he takes from the Steward of the Lord of the
Mannor's Court.

But, as England is one of the most trading Countries in Europe, so the
greatest Body of its Commonalty is that of Traders, or Men that live by Buying
and Selling.

The most eminent whereof are those we call Merchants, who trade only by
Wholesale. These are the Men who, by their Stock and Industry, have found the
Way, not only to Enrich themselves, but to make the whole Nation thrive and
flourish by a perpetual Circulation of Trade, by exporting homebred and
importing foreign Commodities, by encouraging thereby Navigation, and by
procuring comfortable Employment to a vast Number of Artificers, Tradesmen, and
^^etailers.

In short, such is the benign Influence of Trade and Commerce by their means
all over the Nation, that there is scarce any part of it but feels the Benefit
thereof. And for this great Advantage to the Public, as well as their private
Wealth, they have got a proportionable esteem and respect from the rest of the
Nation. Insomuch that, whereas Trading formerly rendered a Gentleman ignoble,
now an ignoble Person makes himself by Merchandising as good as a Gentleman;
and many Gentlemen Born (some of them Younger Sons of Noblemen) take upon them
this Profession, without any prejudice or blemish to their Birth. Nay, the Law
of England, that ever had but a slight Opinion of Traders, is so far
Obliterated in this Point by Custom and Interest, that, whereas by Law a Ward
come to Age may bring his Action of Disparagement against his Guardian for
offering any such in Marriage, now it is common for Gentlemen's and Merchants
Sons and Daughters to Intermarry.

The truth is, Gentility with competent Means is an excellent Compound; but
without it, it is but a wretched Condition, as the World goes now. And who would
not rather be a substantial honest Trader, so as to stand upon his own Legs,
and make some figure in the World, than for want of Employment to starve with a
point of Honor, or live a borrowed Life; in this Age especially, where Poverty
is so little pitied, and grown so contemptible?

Poverty (says an Author) the general Scarecrow of Mankind, the fear of which
keeps Men in perpetual Morion, and makes them run headlong into the greatest
Dangers.

Per Mare Pauperiem fugiunt, per Saxa, per Ignes. Poverty, a lingering kind of
Death, that, having once seized upon ones Spirits, dejects and stupifies him,
takes away the edge of his Senses, weakens his Memory, discomposes his Mind,
and makes him almost incapable of any Thing. Poverty, in a Word, that turns Men
into ridicule, as Juvenal has it in these Words, -- Nil habet Paupertas durius
in se,
Quam quod Ridiculos homines facit --


In France indeed, where if a Gentleman born betakes himself to Trade forfeits
his Gentility, the Gentry stand so much upon their Honor, that it is very rare
to see a French Gentleman turn to Merchandising. But there they have greater
Opportunities for preferring themselves according to their quality, especially
by the Way of Arms. And so jealous is the whole Body of them of this their
Gentility, that rather than have it exposed in any of their Members by naked
and hungry Poverty, their Way is to help one another to the utmost of their
Power, and (which is very commendable) they seldom fail to give a Gentleman,
though never so needy, the Respect due to his Birth. But it is something
surprising, they should so much decline Merchandising, their King Lewis le
Grand, not to mention his other Commodities, being the greatest Salt-Merchant
in the Known World,

But, to return to our Commonalty, it may be said to comprehend three Parts in
four of the Nation, the Generality of them Employed in Husbandry, Trade, and
Navigation, some in a higher, others in a lesser Degree. And such is the
Happiness of this People in general, that none enjoy greater Privileges, or
are more secure by Law from Oppression.

They are subject to no Taxes or Laws, but what they contrive themselves by
their Representatives in Parliament. And, in point of Trials, none of them can
be Tried but by a Jury of his Peers, that is, by Twelve Men Commoners like
himself. Nor can he be Condemned but by the Laws of the Land.

In short, the Government is so very favorable to the Common People of
England, that unless the Laws be invaded, (which are the Bulwark of the
Government) they need not fear to be any Way oppressed.

CHAP. XXII.
Of the Clergy of England, and first of the Bishops.

THE Clergy of England is, like the Laity, divided into several Ranks, or
Degrees. For as the Laity consists of Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty; so the
Clergy is divided into Bishops, Dignitaries, and Inferious Clergy.

The Bishops are those who take upon them the Government of the Church of
England, according to Law, every one in his Diocese. And, as England consists
of 26 Dioceses, or Bishoprics, so there are accordingly 26 Bishops, or
Diocesans. Besides the Bishopric of the Isle of Man, which is a distinct
Bishopric.

Their Office being Pastoral, their Business is to feed their Flocks with the
wholesome Doctrine of the Church, and so to oversee the Inferior Clergy that by
their Lives and Doctrine the People may Keep the Truth, and live according to
the Rules of Christianity.

And, as each of them has a Canonical Authority over all the Priests of his
Diocese, so they have all in chief the Power of Ordination; Which however is
never performed but by the Bishop jointly with some other Priests.

They are also Empowered to grant Institutions to Benefices upon Presentations
of other Patrons, to command Induction to be given, to order the collecting and
preserving of the Profits of vacant Benefices for the Successors Use.

They are bound to defend the Church-Liberties, and once in three Years to
Visit each his Diocese. In this triennial Visitation they Inquire of the
Manners, Carriages, and Offenses of Ministers, Churchwardens, and the rest of
the Parishioners, principally of Offenders against Justice, Piety, and
Sobriety. Wardens of Hospitals, Physicians, Surgeons, Schoolmasters, and
Midwives fall particularly under the Care of their Visitation.

Of the foresaid 26 Bishops, there are two called Archbishops, the one of
Canterbury, and the other of York. These have a Superintendency over all the
Church of England, and in some measure over the other Bishops.

They have each of them his Province, or Jurisdiction; but that of Canterbury
is much the greater of the two. For, of 26 Dioceses, it takes up 22. Whereof 18
in England, viz. Canterbury, London, Winchester, Lincoln, Exeter, Hereford,
Salisbury, Coventry and Lichfield, Bath and Wells, Oxford, Chichester, Ely,
Norwich, Carlisle, Worcester, Gloc^ster, Bristol, Peterborough; and four in
Wales, viz. S. Asaph, Landaff, Bangor, and S. David's. Whereas the Province of
York has but four Diocesses, York, Durham, Chester, and Carlisle; besides that
of the Isle of Man.

Each of these Archbishops is called Primate of England, and Metropolitan of
his Province. Yet the first has some kind of Supereminency over the other, and
has Power to Summon him to a National Synod.

Next to the two Archbishops are the Bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester;
the Order of the rest being by no other Rule than the Priority of their
Consecration.

The Bishop of London has the Precedence of all the other Bishops, not only as
being Bishop over the Metropolis of England, but as Provincial Dean of
Canterbury. And, upon the Vacancy of the Archiepiscopal See, the Bishop of
London has been usually translated to that See; excepting the Case of Dr.
William Sandcroft, the present Archbishop of Canterbury, who from Dean of
Paul's was preferred to this Dignity by King Charles II.

The Bishop of Durham has been a Count Palatine six or seven hundred Years. The
common Seal of his Bishopric has been of a long time an Armed Knight, holding
in one hand a Naked Sword, and in the other a Church. He has also at this day
the Earldom of Sadberg, annexed long ago to this Bishopric.

The Bishop of Winchester was anciently reputed Earl of Southampton, and so
styled by Henry VIII, in the Statutes of the Honorable Order of the Garter.
But that Earldom was soon after disposed of.

The Manner of making a Bishop in England is so solemn, that it is not to be
pretermitted. When a Bishops See becomes vacant, first the Dean and Chapter of
the Cathedral give notice of it to the King, as the Patron of all the
Bishoprics in England; and humbly request his Majesty, that He will give them
Leave to choose another. Whereupon the King grants them his Conge d'eslire, that
is, Leave to elect; and withal does usually recommend unto them whom His
Majesty thinks fit. Then the Dean summons a Chapter, that is, the Prebendaries
of the Cathedral; who either elect the Person recommended by the Kings Letters,
or show Cause to the contrary. The Election being over, it is certified to the
Party elected. Who does modestly refuse it the first and second time; if a
third time, the same is certified to the King, who recommends another. When the
Election is accepted, it is certified to the King, and the Archbishop of that
Province. The King thereupon gives his Royal Assent under the Great Seal of
England, which is exhibited to the Archbishop of that Province, with Command to
confirm and consecrate him. Then the Archbishop subscribes Fiat Confirmatio,
and gives. Commission under his Episcopal Seal to his Vicar General, to perform
all the Acts thereunto required.

Then a Citation comes forth from the said Vicar General in the Name of the
Archbishop, summoning all the People that have any Thing to object against the
Party elected to appear at a certain Time and Place, to make their Objections.
Which is done first by Proclamation three several times, at Bow-Church; and
then the Citation is affixt on the Church door for all people to read. At the
Day and Place assigned for the Opposers Appearance, the Vicar General sitting
as Judge, the Proctor for the Dean and Chapter exhibits the Royal Assent, and
the Commission of the Archbishop. Which being read and accepted by the Vicar
General, the Proctor exhibits the Proxy from the Dean and Chapter, presents the
Bishop elect, returns the Citation, and desires the Opposers to be called in
three times. This being done accordingly, and none appearing, they are
pronounced Contumacious; and a Decree made to proceed to Sentence, in the
behalf of the Bishop elect. Who thereupon takes the Oaths of Supremacy, Simony,
and Canonical Obedience; and then the Judge of the Arches reads and subscribes
the Sentence. After which there is usually an Entertainment made for the
Officers and other there present. And the Bishop elect, being thus Confirmed,
may act as Bishop, even before he is Consecrated.

Some time after this follows the Consecration. For the Bishops are a distinct
Order of themselves, there being three Orders in the Church of England,
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. And, as none may be admitted a Deacon (without a
Dispensation) under the Age of 23 Years, nor a Priest under 24; so none can be
made a Bishop, till he be full 30 Years of age. And, whereas Priests and
Deacons, when they take their respective Orders, are said to be Ordained; a
Bishop, when he takes the Episcopal Order, is said to be Consecrated.

The Consecration is performed by the Archbishop of the Province, or some other
Bishop Commissioned by him, with the Assistance of two other Bishops, either in
the Chapel of the Archbishop, or of any other Bishop. And it is done either
upon a Sunday or Holy Day, after Morning-Service. Then the Archbishop (or his
Deputy) begins the Communion-Service. And, after a certain Prayer appointed for
this Occasion, one of the Bishops present reads the Epistle 1 Timothy 3, another
the Gospel John 21. Which is followed by the Nicene Creed, and next to that a
Sermon. After Sermon, the Bishop elect, being vested with his Rochet or
Linnen-Garment, is by two Bishops presented to the Archbishop, or his Deputy,
sitting in his Chair; who demands the King's Mandate for the Consecration, and
causes it to be read. That done, the Bishop elect takes the Oath of Supremacy,
and of Canonical Obedience to the Archbishop. After which, they fall to
Prayers. Then the Bishop elect does Answer several Interrogatories that are put
to him; and, after his Answers, the rest of the Episcopal Habit is put upon
him. This done, they Kneel down to Prayers again. Which being ended, the Bishop
elect being upon his Knees, the Archbishop and Bishops there present lay their
Hands on his Head, and by a pious grave Form of Words they Consecrate him.
Afterward the Archbishop delivers a Bible to the Bishop elect, with another
set Form of Words. Then they all proceed to the Communion; and having received
the Sacrament, they depart with the Blessing.

Then the new Bishop treats at a spelendid Dinner, the chief of the Nobility,
Clergy, Judges, Privy Counselors, etc. Which Dinner (with the Fees of
Consecration) does usually amount to five or six hundred Pounds.

Next to the Consecration of a Bishop follow his Installation, by virtue of a
Mandate from the Archbishop to the Archdeacon of his Prevince. This is
performed in the Cathedral Church upon any Day between the hours of nine and
eleven, in the presence of a public Notary. When the Bishop elect, or his
Proxy (which is most ^sual) is introduced into the Cathedral by the
Archdeacon, or his Proxy, There he declaies i^ the first place his Assent to
the King's Supremacy and swears that, unless he be otherwise Dispe^sed with, he
will be Resident according to the Custom of that Cathedral, and observe the
Customs of the said Church, and cause others to observe the same. Whereupon the
Archdeacon with the Petty-Canons, and Officers of the Church, accompany the
Bishop up to the Quin^ and there place him in a Seat prepared for him between
the Altar and the right side of the Quine Then the Archdeacon pronounces these
Word^ in Latin, Ego, Authoritate mihi commissa, Induco and Inthronizo
Reverendum in Christo Patrem Domin^^ N. N. Episcopum, and Dominus custodiat
suum Intro^tum and Exitum ex hec nunc, and in saeculum, etc. Upon which Te Deum
is sung, and the Bishop in the mean while conducted from his own Place (...)
the Dean's Seat; where, in Token of his taki^ Possession, he stands till Ye
Deum and some ^ther Prayers be ended.

After Prayers, the Bishop is conducted in^ the Chapter House, and there placed
on a hi^ Seat. Where the Archdeacon, together with (...) the Prebends and
Officers of the Church, co^ before him, and acknowledge Canonical Obe^ence to
him. Finally, the public Notary is (...) the Archdeacon required to make an
Ins^^ment, declaring the whole Matter of Fact i^ this Affair.

Afterward the new Bishop is introduced into be Kings Presence, to do his
Homage for his ^emporalities or Barony. Which he does by ^eeling down before
the King sitting in a Chair ^f State, by putting his Hands between his Ma^sties
Hands, and by taking a Solemn Oath to ^e true and faithful to Him, and that he
holds is Temporalities of him.

After this, he Compounds for the first Fruits ^f his Bishopric, that is,
agrees for his first ^ears Profits to be paid to the King, within two ^ears or
more, if the King please.

When a Bishop is Translated from one Bishopick to another, all the Difference
there is in the ^ranslation from the manner of making a Bi^op is, that there is
no Consecration. And, ^hen a Bishop is made Archbishop, the Diffe^^ce is only
in the Commission, which is directed (...) King to four Bishops, or more to
Confirm (...).

Now there is this Difference between an Archishop and a Bishop, that, whereas
a Bishops Ca^^ical Authority reaches no further than the ^unds of his Diocese,
the Archbishops Power ^tends it self over all his Province, so that he (...)
Ordinary to all the Bishops thereof. Accor^ingly the Bishop Visits only his
Diocese, but (...) Archbishop Visits the whole Province. The ^ishop can
Convocate only a Diocesan, but the ^rehbishop may Convocate a Provincial Synod.
The Bishop with other Priests does Ordain a ^riest, but the Archbishop with
other Bishops ^^es Consecrate a Bishop.

It Is Observable that, several Bishops of Eng^nd having large Bishoprics, it
was provided (...) a Statute made in the Reign of Henry VIII, ^at they should
have a Power to Nominate ^me to the King to be with his Approbation, Suffragan
(or Assistant) Bishops; in case that an^ of them desired it, for the better
Government of his Diocese, or easing himself of some part o^ his Burden. The
Sees of those Suffragan Bishop^ were only to be, at Dover, for the Diocese o^
Canterbury; at Nottingham and Hull, for tha^ of York. For the Diocese of
London, at Co^chester; of Durham, at Berwick; of Winchester, in the Isle of
Wight, at Southampton, and Guilford For the Diocese of Lincoln, at Bedford,
Leicester Huntington, and Grantham; of Norwich, at The^ford and Ipswich; of
Salisbury, at Shaftsbury, Melton, and Marlborough; of Bath and Wells, at
Taunton; of Hereford, at Bridgenorth; of Coventry and Lichfield, at Shrewsbury;
of Ely, at Cambridge; of Exeter, at S. Germans; of Carlisle, at Perith. Now for
any one of the foresaid Places appointed for Suffragan Bishops Sees the
respective Bishop of the Diocese presented two able Men, whereof the King chose
one.

These Suffragan Bishops had the Name, Title, and Dignity of Bishop, and (as
other Bishops) were Consecrated by the Archbishop of the Province. They
executed each of them such Power, Jurisdiction, and Authority, and received
such Profits as were limited in their Commissions by the Bishops (or Diocesans)
whose Suffragans they were. In these Bishops absence, when they were either
residing at Court to advise the King, or employed upon Embassies abroad, the
Suffragans usually supplied their Places. Wh^^ in public Assemblies, took
place next after the Temporal Peers of the Realm. But since the Diocesan
Bishops grew less Courtiers, and more Residentiary, the Suffragan Bishops began
to be laid aside, so that there have been none for many Years in the Church of
England.

I come now to the Prerogatives, Privileges, Bower, Revenues, and great Deeds
of Bishops.

All the Bishops of England are Barons and Peers of the Realm, and sit as such
in the House of Lords. They are the Spiritual Lords, looked upon as the Fathers
(or Gardians) of the Church, and therefore commonly styled Right Reverend
Fathers in God. And, as it is usual in England for well-bred Children to ask
their Parents Blessing Morning and Evening, with one Knee upon the Ground; so
the true Sons of the Church, looking upon the Bishops as their Spiritual
Fathers, commonly begin their Addresses to them by asking their Blessing in the
same respectful manner.

Besides the Privileges enjoyed by Bishops, as Peers, and therefore common
with those of the Temporal Lords, they have some peculiar Prerogatives, and
those of a high nature. It Is unde^iable, that all Jurisdiction in England is
inseparably annexed to the Crown. And yet the Bishops Courts, tho held by the
King's Authority, are not counted to be properly the King's Courts. Therefore
the Bishops send forth Writs in their own Names, Test the Bishop, and not in
the King's Name, as all the King's Courts properly so called do.

And, whereas in other Courts there are several Judges to each, a Bishop in his
Court judges, and passes Sentence alone by himself.

A Bishop besides has this transcendent Privilege, that he may (as the King
does) depute his Authority to another, as to a Bishop Suffragan, his
Chancellor, or Commissary. Which ^one of the King's Judges can do.

Bishops, in whatsoever Christian State they come, their Episcopal Dignity and
Degree is acknowledged; and may, as Bishops, confer Orders, etc. Whereas no
Temporal Lord is in Law acknowledged such out of the Prince's Dominions who
conferred his Honor.

The Law of England attributes so much to the Word of a Bishop, that, not only
in the Trial of Bastardy, the Bishops Certificate shall suffice, but also in
Trial of Heresy, which touches a Man's Life.

If a Clergyman Kills his Bishops or Ordinary, the Law looks upon it as a
Parricide; and it is Petty-Treason, by Law.

Every Bishop may by Statute Law qualify six Chaplains, which is as many as a
Duke.

But, if the Bishops Privileges be so great, the Archbishops are much greater,
especially his Grace of Canterbury's. Who is the first Peer of the Realm, and
next to the Royal Family precedes not only all Dukes, but all the great
Officers of the Crown.

Though he holds his Place from the King, yet in the King's Writs to him he is
styled Dei Gratia Archiepiscopo Cantuariensi; and, whereas other Bishops write
Divina Permissione, he writes himself Divina Providentia. When he is Invested
in the Archbishopric, he is said to be Inthroned.

It belongs properly to him to Crown the King; and he had formerly the Power of
appointing the Lent Preachers, which is now in the Lord High Chamberlain.

The Bishop of London is accounted his Pravincial Dean, the Bishop of
Winchester his Chancellor, and the Bishop of Rochester his Chaplain.

He has the Probate of all Wills in his Province, and the Power of granting
Letters of Administration, where the Party at the time of his Death had 5 l.
worth (or above) out of the Diocese wherein he died, or 10 l. within the
Diocese of London. For all such as die Intestate within his Province he has
Power to make Wills, and to administer their Goods to the Kindred, or to pious
uses, according to his Discretion.

In all Cases heretofore sued for in the Court of Rome he has Power to grant
Licenses and Dispensations, either by himself, or his Deputy, called the Master
of Faculties; Provided the same be not repugnant to the Law of God, or the
King's Prerogative. As to allow a Clerk to hold a Benefice in Commendam or
Trust; to allow a Son (contrary to the Canons) to succeed his Father
immediately in a Benefice; a Beneficed Clerk, upon some Occasions, to be
Non-resident for some time; a Clerk rightly qualified to hold two Benefices
with Cure of Souls; and a Layman to hold a Prebend, etc. whilst by Study he is
preparing himself for the service of the Church.

He may also bestow one Dignity or Prebend in any Cathedral Church within his
Province, upon every Creation of a new Bishop. And the new-created Bishop is
also to provide a sufficient Benefice for one of the Archbishops Chaplains, or
to maintain him till it be effected.

He has the Prerogative, with two other Bishops, to Consecrate a new made
Bishop; to appoint Coadjutors to infirm Bishops; to confirm the Election of
Bishops within his Province; to call Provincial Synods according to the King's
Writ directed to him; to be Moderator in the Synods or Convocations, and there
to give his Suffrage last of all. It Is both his Power and Duty to Visit the
whole Province; and, during the Vacancy of any Bishopric within the same, to
appoint a Guardian of the Spiritualities. So that to him belong all the
Episcopal Rights and Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions of the Diocese, as
Visitations, Institutions, etc.

To decide all Differences in Ecclesiastical Matters, he holds several Courts
of Judicature, for which I refer you to my Third Part.

Lastly, he may retain and qualify 8 Chaplains, which is two more than any Duke
is allowed.

The Archbishop of York has also the Precedence of all Dukes that are not of
the Royal Blood; and of all great Officers of State, except only the Lord
Chancellor.

He is also styled Primate of England, and Metropolitan of his Province; and
has many of those Prerogatives and Privileges which the Archbishop of
Canterbury has within his own Province.

Each of the Archbishops is honored as Dukes are, with the Title of His Grace.
And, whereas the Inferior Bishops are styled Right Reverend, the Archbishops
are in a Superlative manner styled Most Reverend.

As to the Revenues of the English Bishops, the best Bishoprics are those of
Canterbury, Durham, and Winchester, which yield a plentiful Income. Amongst the
rest, some have but a Competency, and others are not much better (some worse)
than many Parsonages.

And yet I must say this to the eternal Praise of the Episcopal Order, that
they have done great Things for the Public out of their Revenues. For most of
the great public Works now ^^maining in England acknowledge their Being,
eather to the sole Cost and Charge, or to the liberal Contributions of Bishops.
I mean not only Palaces and Castles, but Churches, Colleges, Schools,
Hospitals, Almshouses, a great Number whereof have been founded and built by
Bishops. Nay, that famous and chargeable Structure of London Bridge stands to
this day obliged to the liberal Contributions of an Archbishop.

In former Reigns, when the Clergy were judged to be the fittest Persons to
execute most of the chief Offices and Places of the Realm, such Benefits and
Advantages accrued thereby to this Kingdom, that there are few Things of any
great Consequence to the Welfare thereof but the Bishops and Prelates were the
chief Actors therein. The excellent Laws (says an Author) made by several of
the Saxon Kings, from whom we have our Common Laws, and our Privileges
mentioned in Magna Charta, were all made by the Persuasions and Advice of
Bishops, named in our Histories. And 'twas a Bishop of London, at whose Request
William the Conqueror granted to this City so large Privileges, that, in a
grateful Remembrance thereof, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen did, before the late
dreadful Fire, upon some solemn Days of their Resort to S. Paul's Church, use
to go in Procession about the Gravestone where that Bishop lay interred. The
Union of the two Houses of York and Lancaster (whereby a long and cruel Civil
War was ended) was by the Advice and Counsel of Bishop Morton, then a Privy
Counselor. And the happy Union of England and Scotland was brought to pass by
the long Foresight of the Reverend Bishop Fox, a Privy Counselor, in advising
Henry VII, to match his eldest Daughter to Scotland, and his Younger to France.

But, above all, the Converting England to Christianity, the Reforming of it
when corrupted, and the Defense of the Reformation against all Romish Writers,
is principally (if not solely) owing to Bishops and Prelates.

CHAP. XXIII.
Of the Dignified Clergy.

AS amongst the Laity the Gentry Keeps a middle Rank betwixt the Nobility and
the Commonalty, so amongst the Clergy of England there is a middle Station
between the Episcopal Order and the inferior Clergy. Which Station is properly
that of the Dignified Clergy, as Deans, Archdeacons, and Prebendaries, the
Subject of this Chapter.

For a Supply of able and fit Persons to make Bishops, or to assist Bishops, a
certain Number of eminent Divines both for their Piety and Learning were
thought fit by our Forefathers to be placed in a Collegiate manner at every
Cathedral, or Episcopal See; out of which Seminaries fit Persons from time to
time might be chosen to govern the Church. Who, living here in a Society
together, have the Opportunity of getting Experience, of reading Men, and
raising themselves by degrees above their former Familiarity with the inferior
Country Clergy. Whereby they fit themselves for Government and Authority in the
Church.

Accordingly in every Cathedral Church in England there is a certain Number of
Prebendaries, or Canons, and a Dean over them; most of them with a plentiful
Maintenance, but so that the Dean has commonly a double Portion.

Deans of the old Foundations, which were before the Suppression of
Monasteries, are brought to their Dignities much like Bishops. The King first
sends forth his Conge d'eslire to the Chapter, who thereupon proceed to the
Election. To their Election the King grants his Royal Assent; then the Bishop
confirms the Party elected, and gives his Espiscopal Mandate to Instal him.
Whereas the Deans of the new Foundations (upon Suppression of Abbeys or
Priories transformed by Henry VIII, into Dean and Chapter) are Installed a much
shorter way, by virtue of the King's Letters Patents, without either Election
or Confirmation.

In the Cathedral Churches of S. David, and of Landaff, in Wales, there never
has been any Dean. But the Bishop in either is Head of the Chapter; and, in the
Bishops absence, the Chanter at S. David's, and at Landaff the Archdeacon.

It Is observable besides, that there are some Deans in England without any
Jurisdiction, but only for Honor so called; as the Dean of the Chapel Royal,
the Dean of S. George's Chapel at Windsor, the Deans of Rippon and Garnsey,
and all the Deans created by Henry VIII.

Some Deans there are without any Chapter, that enjoy however certain
Jurisdictions; as the Deans of Croydon, Battle, and Bocking.

A Prebendary is so called (as some will have it) a praebendo Auxilium aut
Consilium Episcope vel Decano, from giving Help or Counsel to the Bishop or
Dean. Or (as others) from the Word Prebend, which signifies the Portion which
every Member or Canon of a Cathedral Church receives for his Maintenance out of
the common Stock of the Church. Of which Prebends some are Simple, or have no
more but the Revenue toward their Maintenance; and others with Dignity, such
as have Jurisdiction annexed to them, according to the diverse Orders of
Churches.

Now among the Prebendaries (or Canons) of the old Foundations, some are
Canonici actu, such as have Right to vote in the Chapter. Others Canonici in
Herba, that have a Stall in the Quire, but no Vote in the Chapter; only having
right to the next Prebend that shall become void.

The Dean and Prebendaries ought to reside in their respective Cathedral and
Collegiate Churches, to frequent public divine Service, to preach by turns
upon Sundays and all festival Days, and at due time to administer the Lord's
Supper. They ought to instruct the weakest sort of the Country Clergy, to
direct them how and what to preach, whereby they may best profit their
Auditors. In short, they ought to show good Example to the Inferior Clergy.
And, when summoned by the Bishop, they are to assist him in some of his
Episcopal Functions; as Ordinations, Deprivations ab Officio and Beneficio,
Condemnation of obstinate Heretics, etc. Upon the King's Writ of Conge
d'eslire, they elect the Bishop of that Diocese.

The chief of the Prebendaries is the Sub-Dean, who supplies the Deans part in
his absence.

Archdeacons are so called for their Charge over the Deacons, who are in every
Diocese to be guided and directed under the Bishop thereof by the Arch Deacon,
though a Presbyter himself.

There are of these 60 in all England, each Diocese having in it one or more
Arch-Deaconries, for Dispatch of Ecclesiastical Business, Their Office is to
Visit two Years in three, the third Year being the Bishops Visitation Year.
Then the Archdeacon is to inquire of Reparations and Movables belonging to the
Churches under his Jurisdiction, to reform Abuses in Ecclesiastical Matters,
and to bring the more weighty Affairs before the Bishop of the Diocese.
Therefore he is called alter Episcopi Oculus, the other being the Dean. He is
also, upon the Bishops Mandate, to Induct Clerks into their Benefices, and
thereby to give them Possession of all the Profits thereunto belonging.

Many Archdeacons have, by Prescription, their Courts and Officials, as
Bishops have.

Lastly, there are Rural Deans, anciently called Archipresbyteri, and Decani
Christianitatis, perhaps because they had the Oversight of a certain Number of
Priests. Now their Office is, upon the Bishops Orders, to convocate the Clergy,
to signify unto them (sometimes by Letters) the Bishops Pleasure, and to give
Induction in the Archdeacons place, when he lives far off.

Every Arch-Deaconry is subdivided into fewer or more Rural Deanries.

Note, that, besides Bishoprics, all Deanries are in the Kings Gift; and so
are most Prebends and Canonicates, with many great, and some smaller Parsonages.

CHAP. XXIV.
Of the Inferior Clengy; Also, of the Churchwardens, Sidesmen, and
Parish-Clerks.

BY the Inferior Clergy I mean the Parish Priests, and Deacons. The first
vulgarly called Parsons, are either Rectors, or Vicars. The Priest of every
Parish is called Rector, unless the Praedial Tithes be Impropriated; and then
he has the Title of Vicar, quasi vice fungens Rectoris.

Thus, as I said before page 236, there are three Orders in the Church of
England, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. That of Deacons is the first step into
the Service of the Church, and seems only ministerial to the Priestly Office.
For the Charge of Deacons is to take care of the Poor, baptize, read in the
Church, assist the Priest at the Lord's Supper, by giving the Cuponly. And this
is properly to fit and prepare him for the Priestly Office.

None may be admitted a Deacon before the Age of 23 Years, without a
Dispensation; nor may a Deacon be admitted into the Priestly Order, without a
Dispensation, till he has served as Deacon the space of one Year.

The Ordination of Priests and Deacons is performed four times in the Year,
upon four several Sundays in the Ember Weeks. Which, by the Laws of the Church,
is a Time of Prayer and Fasting for the whole Nation, that so by their joint
Prayers they may recommend to God all that are to receive Ordination. Those are
the Weeks called Quatuor Tempora by the ancient Fathers, and of great Antiquity
in the Church. The proper Days for this Devotion are the Wednesday, Friday, and
Saturday next after Quadragesima Sunday, after Holy-Rood Day in September, and
S. Lucies Day in December.

The Ordination is performed in a most solemn, grave, and devout manner, by a
Bishop, assisted with some of the Dignified Clergy, or others in Priestly
Order. I begin with that of Deacons, which is thus

First, after Morning Prayer, there is a Sermon about the Duty and Office of
Deacons and Priests. The Sermon ended, those that stand for Deacons being
decently habited are presented to the Bishop by the Archdeacon, or his Deputy.
Whom the Bishop asks, if he has made due Inquiry of them; and then asks the
People, if they Know any notable Impediment or Crime in any of them. Then
follow certain godly Prayers, with the Collect, and Epistle appointed for this
Solemnity. After which, the Oath of Supremacy is administered to every one of
them; and the Bishop puts diverse godly Questions to them. Which being answered,
they all Kneel; and he laying his Hands upon them severally does Ordain them
Deacons. Then he delivers to every one of them the New Testament, and gives
them Authority to read the same in the Church. Whereupon the Bishop appoints
one of them to read the Gospel. This done, they with the Bishop proceed to the
Communion; and so are dismissed with the Blessing pronounced by the Bishop.

The Ordination of Priests is much after the same manner. Only the Epistle and
Gospel are different; and, after the Questions and Answers made, the Bishop
puts up a particular Prayer for them. Which being ended, he desires the
Congregation to recommend them to God secretly in their Prayers; for doing of
which there is a competent time of general Silence. Then follows Veni Creator
Spiritus, in Meter to be sung. And, after another Prayer, they all Kneeling,
the Bishop, with one or two of the grave Priests there present, lays his Hands
upon the Head of every one of them severally, and so gives them Ordination in a
grave set Form of Words, different both from that of Bishops, and that of
Deacons. The rest is the same as in the Ordaining of Deacons.

What the Office of a Parish Priest is, is so well known, that I need not
insist upon it. His Orders he has from the Bishop, but the Benefice he holds
from the Patron. Now we call those Patrons of Churches, who by first building
of Churches, or first indowing them with I ands, have obtained for them and
their Heirs a Right of Advowson or Patronage. Who, when the Church is void, is
to propose a fit Clerk to the Bishop, to be by him Canonically Instituted.

As to the Revenues of the Inferior Clergy, they are (as in all Places)
unequally divided. So that some Parsons have a very plentiful, some but a
competent, and others but a small Maintenance; some two or three hundred pounds
per Annum or more, others one hundred or thereabouts, and some much short of
that. Which, besides the Glebe-Land, is mostly raised by way of Tithes, and the
Duties paid for Christenings, Marriages, and Funerals.

The Plurality of Benefices, that is, the Privilege of holding more Livings
than one, allowed by the Church of England for the Encouragement of worthy and
eminent Divines, makes room for many Curates. So we call those who officiate in
those Churches, where such as hold Plurality of Livings do not Keep their
Residence. These Curates are such Clergymen as they think fit to appoint in
their places, with such an Allowance as is agreed upon amongst themselves.

The Condition of Vicars is much the same as that of Curates, if not worse.
These properly officiate in those Livings which are called Impropriations, of
which there are in England no less than 3845. For above a third part of the
best Benefices of England, being anciently by the Popes Grant appropriated to
Monasteries toward their Maintenance, were upon the Dissolution of the
Monasteries made Layfees. Which Benefices ever since have been accordingly
provided, not with the best Allowances, nor with the best of the Clergy.

Amongst the Privileges of the Clergy, this is one of the principal, that all
Deans, Archdeacons, Prebendaries, Rectors, and Vicars may, some by themselves,
others by Proxy or by Representative, sit and vote (as Commons Spiritual) in
the Lower House of Convocation.

No Subsidies, or other Tax to the King, might formerly be laid upon them,
without their own Consent first had in Convocation. And indeed the Clergy
paying to the King the first Fruits, that is, the first Years Profits of all
Spiritual Benefices, and yearly the Tenth of all the said Benefices, 'twas
thought but reasonable they should be exempted from all other Taxes. Though, to
give the Laity good Example, they have often laid upon themselves Subsidies,
and other great Taxes.

The Glebe-Lands, and Spiritual Revenues of Clergymen, being held in pura and
perpetua Eleemosyna, that is (as the Law calls it) in Frankalmoine, are
exempted from arraying and Mustering of Men, or Horses for the War. And, as by
their Function they are prohibited to wear any Arms, therefore they cannot
serve personally in War. But they serve their Country otherwise, by being our
Leaders in our Spiritual Warfare.

Neither can any Clergyman be compelled to undergo any other Personal
Functions, or Services in the Commonwealth. For, if any Man, by reason of his
Land, be liable to be elected to any Servile Office, if he takes Orders, he is
free, and there lies a Writ purposely to free him.

Clergymen are not obliged to appear at Sheriffs Turns, or Courts-Leet, there
to take their Oath of Allegiance.

By Magna Charta, no Clergyman ought to he Fined or Amerced according to his
Spiritual Means, but according to his Temporal Estate, and to the Crime
committed.

The Goods of Clergymen are discharged, by the Common Law of England, from
Tolls and Customs of Average, Pontage, Murage, and Panage; for which they have
the King's Writ to discharge them, provided they don't trade with them.

All Clergymen are free from the King's Purveyors, Carriages, Post, etc. for
which they may demand a Protection from the King, with the Clause Nolumus.

As to the whole Number of the Clergy in England, besides the two Archbishops,
and the twenty four Bishops, there are 26 Deans of Cathedral and Collegiate
Churches, 576 Prebendaries, 9653 Rectors and Vicars; besides as many more
Curates and others in holy Orders.

In point of Learning and good exemplary Life, England (I dare say) is outdone
by no Clergy in the Christian World. If, amongst the Inferior Clergy there be
some ignorant lewd Livers, the dignified Clergy, and the Episcopal College,
are generally Men noted both for their great Piety and deep Learning. And the
late Scuffle they had with the Romanists in so difficult a Juncture as King
James his Reign, as it has sufficiently shown the greatness of their Parts and
the Depth of their Learning, so it expressed to the World their strong and
invincible Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and the gross Mistake of
Dissenters that looked upon them as broad-faced Papists.

Nothing troubles me more, than to see some of the Clergy so much infatuated as
to endeavor to defeat (as far as in them lies) the late signal Providence,
that rescued us so wonderfully from Popery and Slavery. I do not reflect upon
those who remain quiet under their Scruples of Conscience, and are not so far
disturbed in their Mind as to disturb the Government. But to see some so
low-spirited as to fall a hugging their old Enemies the French, and admire them
as their Tutelar Angels who were but 'tother Day the greatest Object of their
Scorn and Contempt, this affords matter of admiration. It Is pretty to see the
Temper of these Men, and those they have infected, all made up of
Contradictions. They hate their Friends, and love their Enemies. They deride
Popery, and yet do their utmost to bring it in. None more averse than they from
Slavery, but leave no Stone unturned to work it into these Kingdoms. Whose
Condition is like that of a Sick Person, that longs for Health, and yet is
greedy to catch at any Thing that pleases his Fancy, let it prove never so
fatal. The Truth is, it is nothing else in the bottom but a malignant Humor,
that causes Inflammation, and strikes up to the Brain; lately a catching, but
now (thanks be to God) a vanishing Disease.

I conclude with the Parish Church Officers, which are indeed Laymen; but, as
they have a peculiar Relation to the Church, they may be counted to be
half-Clergy-men.

The Churchwardens, amongst these, are the principal. Whose Office is to see,
that the Church be in good Repair, and want nothing for Divine Service, etc.
That the Churchyard be well enclosed, and an exact Terrier of the Glebe-Land
be Kept. They are also to sue for any Thing Kept from the Church, that is of
right belonging to it; to inquire after, admonish, and present to the Bishop
scandalous Livers, and to collect the Charity of the Parishioners. The Bishops
Orders they are both to declare, and to execute.

They serve commonly two Years in that Station, and Easter-Week is the time for
their Election. Usually they are elected by the Parson and the Parishioners,
where it is so agreed. If not, the Parson chooses one, and the Parishioners the
other.

In some great Parishes there are joined Sidesmen to the Churchwardens, to
assist them in the Inquiries into the Lives of inordinate Livers, and in
presenting Offenders at Visitations.

Next is the Clerk, whose Office is to serve at Church the Priest and
Churchwardens. He ought to be at least 20 Years old, and a Man of good Life
and Conversation, that can read, write, and sing Psalms, the tuning whereof is
part of his Office. He is commonly chosen by the Parson only.

In many Parishes there is also one Sexton, or more. So we call those that
attend the Parishioners at Church, and let them into their Pews. Which in
Cathedral and Collegiate Churches is commonly performed by the Vergers, so
called from a Silver Verge which they carry in their hands.

To take care of the Parish-Concerns, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, a great
Power is by Law committed to the Vestry-men; So called from the Vestry, a Room
adjoining to the Church for the Use of the Parson and Parish-Officers. They are
a select Number of the chief Parishioners in every Parish within the City of
London and Suburbs, and elsewhere; who yearly choose Officers for the Parish, as
Churchwardens, Constables, Scavengers, Collectors for the Poor, etc. The
Beadle's is a standing Office.

CHAP. XXV.
Of Women.

ALL Women in England are either Noble, or Ignoble. The first are so by
Descent, Creation, or Marriage.

By Descent, as when a Lady holds an Estate by a noble Title. For Titles of
Honor sometimes, for want of Males, do descend to Females. But only to one of
them, because they are Things in their own nature entire, and not to be divided
amongst many, as the Lands and Tenements are, which descend in equal Proportion
to all the Daughters. By Creation, some Women have been made, at the King's
pleasure, Baronesses, Countesses, and Dutchesses.

But the greatest Part of the English Noblewomen are so only by Marriage, all
Women being counted Noble that are married to any Peer of the Realm. And so (as
the Law says) Uxor fulget Radiis Mariti.

Yet, if afterward they marry to Men not Noble, they lose by Law their former
Dignity, and follow their latter Husbands Condition; though by the Courtesy of
England, they are still looked upon and respected as Noble, and called by the
Name of the former Husband. But Women, Noble by Descent or Birthright, or by
Creation, retain by Law their Nobility, tho they Marry afterward to Husbands
under their Degree.

It Is observable, that any Noble-woman by Birth, being married to a Baron,
takes place but as Baroness, though she be a Duke's Daughter. But, if she marry
to one under the Degree of a Nobleman, as to a Knight or Gentleman, the
Courtesy of England gives her place according to her Birth, and not her
Husbands Condition.

A Noble-woman marrying to an Ignoble Man adds no Honor to him. Her Honor is
all hers, and he has no share in it, though by Marriage he becomes Master of
all her Goods and Chattels. But her Dignities with the Lands, descend to her
next Heir.

Noble-women, in the Eye of the Law, are Peers of the Realm; and accordingly
they enjoy most of the Privileges of Peers. But it is thought, they cannot
maintain an Action upon the Statute De Scandalo Magnatum.

As happy as the Condition of married Women is generally all over England, yet
the Laws of this Kingdom are in the main very severe upon them. For, when a
Woman marries, she gives her self over, and what she brings with her, to the
power of her Husband. Whatever she is possessed of, the Husband becomes the
Proprietor of it; and her very necessary Apparel is not hers in Propriety. If
she has any Tenure, it is all in Capite, that is, she holds it of, and by her
Husband, who is the Head of his Wife. And all the Chattels personal she had at
the Marriage are so much her Husbands, that, he dying before her, they shall
not return to his Wife, but go with his other Goods and Chattels to the
Husband's Executor or Administrator. Except the Paraphernalia, that is, those
Goods which a Wife, besides her Dower or Jointure, is after her Husbands Death
allowed to have, as Furniture for her Chamber, wearing Apparel, and Jewels if
she be of quality; which are not to be put into her Husband's Inventory,
especially in the Province of York.

The Wife can make no Contract without her Husband's Consent; and without it
she cannot set, sell, give away, or alienate any Thing.

So great is her Subjection to her Husband's Will, that, in the Sense of the
Law, she has no Will of her own. Therefore, when a Man and his Wife commit a
Felony together, the Wife can neither be Principal, nor Accessory; the Law
supposing she was forced thereunto, in regard of the Subjection and Obedience
she ows to her Husband.

In short, by the Law of England, a Wife is so much in the Power of her
Husband, that she is no better than a Child, or the best of Servants. For she
can call nothing her own, more than a Child, whom his Father suffers to call
many Things his own, yet can dispose of nothing. And, when she offends, it is in
her Husband's Power to correct her, as a Servant. Therefore, if she wrong
another by her Tongue, on by Trespass, her Husband must answer for her Fault,
and make Satisfaction.

But a Woman, upon Marriage, does not only lose the Power over her Person, Will
and Goods; but she must part with her very Name, and ever after use her
Husband's Surname, contrary to the Custom of some other Countries.

One Thing more there is yet which evidences the great Subjection of a Wife to
her Husband. And that is the Punishment inflicted upon a Woman that has Killed
her Husband, which is to be Burnt alive; the Offense being counted
Petty-Treason by Law, that is, as great a Crime as the Killing of his Father,
or Master.

Yet in some things the Law is very favorable to the female Sex of England. As
for Example, if a Wife bring forth a Child begotten before Marriage by another
Man than her present Husband, her Husband is bound to own the Child, and that
Child shall be his Heir at Law. So literally we take the Saying, Pater est quem
Nuptiae demonstrant.

If a Husband be a long time absent from his Wife, though it be for some Years,
and his Wife bring forth a Child during his Absence, he must father that Child,
in case he lived all the while in this Island, or (to speak the Words of the
Law) inter quatuor Maria. And, if that Child be her firstborn Son, and her
Husband's Estate Intailed, or left without Will, that Child shall be Heir to it.

Another Privilege of English-Women is, that the Wife having no Jointure
settled before Marriage, may challenge, after her Husband's Death, the third
part of his yearly Rents of Land during her Life; and within the City of
London, a third Part of all her Husband's Movables for ever. If there be many
Children, the rest comes to the eldest; if not, to the next Heir at Law. And,
if she do not approve of the Division, she may claim the Right of being Endowed
with the best of the Land, to a third part.

But, if the Law be so favorable in some Cases to married Women, Custom, or
rather the good Nature of Englishmen, makes their Condition much happier. Whose
Respect and Tenderness for them is generally so great, that every where they
give 'em the Precedence, and put them the least of any Nation upon Drudgery and
Hardship. Women are not here mewed up as in Italy and Spain; and that
mischievous Passion of Jealousy has got so little footing here, that the Nation
is little troubled with its troublesome Influences, or fatal Consequences. In
short, married Women have here more Liberty, than any where else. Their chief
Care is of the House and Household, according to the ancient Custom of the Greek
Wives; which is indeed the proper Office of a Wife, as the Husband's is to mind
his Concerns abroad.

And such is generally their Carriage to their Husbands, and their mutual
Tenderness for them, that, where the Law gives them nothing, the dying Husband
often leaves all behind him to the Disposal of his Wife. Except in London,
where a peculiar Order is taken by the City agreeable to the Civil Law.

A Knight's Wife is, by the Courtesy of England, counted and called a Lady. If
her Husband die before her, and she take afterward (...) Husband of a lower
estate, still she shall be ^alled Lady with the surname of her first husband,
and not of the second. Which is by ^he Courtesy of England, and according to
^adies of a higher Rank, as I have before ob^erved.

In point of real Estate, it is Observable, that, ^f the Wife be an Heiress, and
bring to her Husband an Estate in Land, that Land descends ^o her eldest Son;
and, if she has no Sons, ^ut only Daughters, it is divided amongst them. But,
if she dies without Issue, the ^and goes immediately to the next Heir at Law.
Only the Husband shall enjoy the Pro^^es thereof during his Life, if so be that
he ^^d a Child alive of her Body, that had been heard once to cry. And this
also is called the Courtesy of England.

As to what I said before touching real and personal Estates in case of
Matrimony, the same is to be understood in the sense of the Common Law, where
there is no private Contract. For whatever Contract or Covenants were made
before the Marriage betwixt the husband and the Wife, either by themselves, ^y
their Parents, or Friends, they take place, and are of force to be Kept
according to the Validity thereof.

Lastly, the Wife in England is accounted (...) much one with her Husband, that
she cannot be produced as Witness for or against her Husband. And so strong is
the Tie that joins them together, that they may not be wholly Separated by any
Agreement between themselves, but only by a Judicial Sentence.

Now there is a twofold Separation, both called by the name of Divorce. The one
in case of Adultery, a Mensa and Thoro, Which is nothing else but a living
asunder, without a liberty-to Remarry, whilst either Party is alive. Whereas
the other is a Vinculo Matrimonii, from the Bond of Matrimony, whereby each
Party is free to Remarry. And this is allowed upon a Nullity of the Marriage,
or upon some essential Impediment, as Consanguinity or Affinity within the
Degrees forbidden, Precontract, Impotency, or such like. Of which Divines
reckon fourteen, according to these Verses, Error, Conditio, Votum, Cognatio,
Crimen,
Cultus, Disparitas, Vis, Ordo, Ligamen, Honestas,
Si sis Affinis, si forte Coire nequibis,
Si Parochi, and duplicis desit praesentia Testis,
Raptave sit Mulier, etc.


But sometimes, in case of Adultery, this plenary Divorce has been allowed of,
in private Cases, by Act of Parliament.

CHAP. XXVI.
Of Children, and Servants.

FRom the Condition of Women in England, I come now to that of Children and
Servants. As to the first, a Father in England has a more absolute Authority
over his Children, than is usual in our Neighbor Countries. Here a Father may
give all his Estate Unintailed from his Children, and all to one Child; the
Consideration whereof is apt to keep his Children in aw, and within the bounds
of filial Obedience.

But commonly the eldest Son inherits all Lands, and the younger Children Goods
and Chattels, by which is meant the Personal Estate. Among the Nobility and
Gentry, the eldest Son's Wife's Portion does usually go for the Portions of his
Sisters; and the younger Sons are put out to some Profession.

The Reason why the eldest Son is so well provided beyond the rest of the
Children is, that he may be the better able to bear up the Honor of the
Family, which in course ^alls to the share of the Eldest. For, when all is
done, Titular Honor without Means, is commonly looked upon but as an empty
Shadow.

But, if there be no Son, the Lands, as well as Goods, are equally divided
among the Daughters.

A Son at the Age of 14, his Father being dead, may choose his Guardian, and may
claim his Land holden in Socage, that is, such Lands as Tenants hold by, or for
certain inferior Services of Husbandry to be performed to the Lord of the Fee.
He is free to consent to Marriage, and may by Will dispose of Goods and
Chattels.

At the Age of 15, he ought to be Sworn to his Allegiance to the King; at 21 he
is said to be of full Age. Then he is free to make any Contracts, and to pass
by Will both Goods and Lands; which in other Countries may not be done till the
Age of 25, called Annus Consistentiae.

A Daughter at the Age of 7 Years, may consent to Marriage; but at 12, she is
free to retract or confirm it. If she confirms it, then the Marriage is good,
and she may make a Will of Goods and Chattels.

At 21 she may Contract, or Alienate her Lands by Will, or otherwise.

Servants in England are either tied to a certain Number of Years, or only by
the Year; these being free to quit their Service at such a Warning as is agreed
upon between the Master (or the Mistress) and the Servant.

By those that are tied to a certain Number of Years, I mean Apprentices, the
usual Time for their Apprentiship being 7 Years. This is the most Servile
Condition in England, considering the Lash they ly under, together with their
long and strict Confinement, under Articles. And, whereas other Servants
receive Wages for their Service, these commonly do pay a Sum of Money to their
Masters for their Prenticeship.

The Condition of other Servants is much easier all over England. For, besides
that few undergo the Hardship that Prentices do, they may be free at the Years
end, giving 3 Months Warning; and, if a Servant do not like one Master, he may
go to another, where perhaps he may find more favor or advantage. But, before
a Person ventures upon such a Servant, it is civil first to get his former
Masters Leave, and prudential to have from him a testimony of his faithfulness
and diligence.

Now there are so many Degrees of Ser^ants in England, that if some live
meanly, there are others who live genteely, and some of these so splendidly as
to keep Servants of their own. In great Families where a Person of quality
makes a proper Figure, and has a suitable Attendance, there is a necessary
Subordination of Servants; so that the Inferior Servants may be at the beck of
their Superior Officers, to answer the several parts of their respective
Duties. Thus a great Man lives like a Prince, and Keeps a Court of his own.

In general it may be said, no Country is more favorable than England to
Servants; who generally live here with more ease and less Subjection, and have
larger Salaries than any where else.

The truth is, if we consider the nature of a Servant, how by going to Service
he devests himself of what is dearest to Mankind, his Liberty, and Subjects his
Will to another, who sometimes proves magget-headed, cruel, or tyrannical, I
think it but reasonable, to have a tender Regard for good Servants. For this,
amongst other Things, was that great Man of Spain, Cardinal Ximenes, so noted
in his time; who proved so bountiful and so generous a Master to his Servants,
that History to this day does admire him for it.

As for stubborn and unruly Servants, the Law of England gives Masters and
Mistresses Power to correct them; and Resistance in a Servant is punished with
severe Penalty. But for a Servant to Kill his Master or Mistress is so high a
Crime, that it is counted Petty Treason, or a Crime next to High Treason.

Since Christianity prevailed here, England admits of no foreign Slaves. In
foreign Plantations indeed, the English, as other Nations, buy and sell Negro's
as Slaves. But a foreign Slave brought over into England is, upon Landing, ipso
facto free from Slavery, though not from ordinary Service.

It Is true there has been a sort of Tenure here, called a Tenure in Villenage,
and the Tenant Villain, who was in effect a Bondman to the Lord of the Land.
For the Lord might take Redemption of him to marry his Daughter, and to make
him free. He might put him out of his Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels,
at his Will; and might beat and chastise, but not maim him. Now such Villains
are out of date, though the Law concerning them stands unrepealed to this day.
Servorum and Nativorum (says Spelman) apud nos sublata est Conditio, and quas
ideo possidebant Terras vel Praedia hodie libere tenent sub antiquae Servitutis
Consuetudinibus. And Sir Edward Coke out of Fortescue has this Note, Impius and
Crudelis judicandus qui Libertati non favet; for which he gives this as the
Reason of it, Anglia Jura in omni Casu dant favorem Libertati, the Laws of
England in all Cases stand for Liberty.

THE NEW STATE OF ENGLAND. PART III. Of the Courts of Judicature.
CHAP. I.
Of the Parliament of England.

THE High Court of Parliament being the Great Council of England, the Supreme
Court of Judicature, and One of the most August Assemblies the World, is the
Court that I am to speak in the first place.

It came to be called Parliament from the French Parliament, and this from their
Verb Parler to speak (or talk) together. The same is taken in a twofold Sense.
First, as it includes the Legislative Power of England, as when we say an Act
of Parliament. In which Acceptance it includes the King, Lords, and Commons;
each of which have a Negative Voice in making Laws, so that without their joint
Consent no Law can by either abrogated, or made. Secondly, in a Vulgar Sense;
as when we say the King and Parliament, or the King has called a Parliament, by
which is meant the Two Houses, viz. the House of Lords and the House of Commons.

This Court is a Body Corporate, consisting (according to the first Acceptance
of the Word) of the Three Estates of the Realm. And though the Name Parliament,
by which it is now called, be not probably older than the Conquest by William
Duke of Normandy; yet it is made plain by ancient Records and Precedents, that
the former Kings of England, even in the Saxons-time, had from time to time
great National Councils, much of the same nature as our Parliaments. In the
Saxons Time, says Lambard, the great Council of the Nation consisted of the
King, Lords, and Commons. It is most apparent, (says Prinn) by all the old
Precedents before the Conquest, that all our ancien^ Councils were nothing else
but Parliaments, called by different Names in several Ages, till at las^ that
of Parliament was fixed upon them; and that our Kings, Nobles, Senators,
Aldermen Wisemen, Knights, and Commons were usual present, and voted there as
Members and Judge The same is averred by many Records an^ Precedents touching
this Matter, in the Appendix to Petyt's Miscellanea Parliamentaria. Which does
not quadrate with the Opinion of those who have affirmed, that there was never
any Parliament in England, according to the present Constitution thereof, till
the Reign of Henry III, that is, betwixt four and five hundred Years since; and
that the grand Council consisted only of the great Men of the Nation, till that
King was pleased to call the Commons to sit also in Parliament.

The Power of Convening (or Calling) a Parliament is solely in the King. But,
if the King be under Age, or not Compos Mentis, or Absent out of the Realm upon
some Expedition, it is lodged in the Protector or Regent, who then summons the
Parliament, but still in the King's Name.

The Summons ought to be at least 40 Days before the Day appointed for the
Meeting; and it is done by Writ in Law-Latin, expressing that it is with the
Advice of the Privy Council. Which Writ is a kind of short Letter directed and
sent by the Lord Chancellor (or Commissioners of the Chancery) to every Lord
Spiritual and Temporal, to appear at a certain Time and Place, to treat and
give their Advice in some important Affairs concerning the Church and State,
etc. And, as for the House of Commons, Writs are sent to all the Sheriffs,
commanding them to summon the People to elect two Knights for each County, two
Citizens for each City, and one or two Burgesses for each Borough, according to
Statute, Charter, or Custom.

And, whereas there are some Cities and Towns that are Counties of themselves,
or that have each within it self the Privilege of a County, the Writ is
directed to them as it is to Sheriffs of other Counties.

At every County, after the Delivery of the Parliament Writ to the Sheriffs,
Proclamation is made in the full County of the Day and Place appointed for the
Parliament to sit, and for all Freeholders to attend such a Time and Place for
the Election of the Knights for that County. But the Sheriff ought to give a
convenient Time for the Day of Election, and sufficient Warning to those that
have Voices, that they may be present. Otherwise the Election is not good, if,
for want of due Notice, part of the Electors be absent.

Now, by an Act in the Reign of Henry VI, it was Ordained, that none should
have any Suffrage in the Election of the Knights of the Shire, but such as were
Freeholders, did reside in the County, and had a yearly Revenue, at least to
the Value of 40 Shillings; which, before the Discovery of the Gold and Silver
in America, was as much as 30 l. now. And the Sheriff has Power by the said Act
to examine upon Oath every such Chuser, how much he may expend by the Year, if
he doubt the value of it.

If any Man keep a Household in one County, and remain in Service with another
Family in another County, yet he may be at the Choosing of Knights of the Shire
where he Keeps his Family; for it shall be said in Law a Dwelling in that
County.

The Election ought to be in full County between 8 and 9 of the Clock,
according to Statute. And no Election (says the Lord Coke) can be made of any
Knight of the Shire but between 8 and 11 of the Clock in the Forenoon. But, if
the Election be begun within the Time, and cannot be determined within those
Hours, the Election may be proceeded upon.

Before Election can be made, or Voices given, the Precept directed to the
Sheriff ought to be read and published. And, if the Party or Freeholders demand
the Poll, the Sheriff ought not to deny the Scrutiny, for he cannot discern who
be Freeholders by the View. In short, of so many as stand for Competitors, the
two that have most Voices are declared to be duly elected for the ensuing
Parliament.

Plurality of Voices does likewise carry it for Citizens that stand for Cities,
and Burgesses for Boroughs. Where in some Places none but Freeholders have a
Right of Election, in others all Householders have a share in it. And, though no
Alien can be a Parliament Man; yet, if he be a Householder, his Voice is good,
as in the Election of the Members for the City of Westminster.

A Burgess elected for two several Boroughs, as it sometimes happens, must wave
one Election when he comes to the House, and choose for which Place of the two
he will serve; so as a Writ may issue for a new Election, that the Number may
be full.)

All Elections ought to be freely and indifferently made, notwithstanding any
Prayer or Command to the contrary. Or else the Parliament is not, as it should
be, free. It Is true the Elections can never be so free, as not to be liable to
the Temptations of private Interest, or the Influence of Feasting, two
unavoidable Evils. Yet it does not follow but that a Parliament may be called
Free, when the Court has no hand in the Elections by such unlawful Methods as
were used in the late Reign, by Closetting, by fair Promises, and foul Threats.

The Returns concerning the Parties chosen are made in the Crown-Office, by the
Sheriffs, Mayors, or Bailiffs, whom the Writs were sent to, and to whom it
belongs to manage the Elections.

Upon a false Return, which happens but too frequently, the Sheriff who made
the Return is liable to the Forfeiture of 100 l. to the King, and 100 l. more
to the Party injured, and to be Imprisoned for a Year without Bail or Mainprize
And every Mayor or Magistrate of a Town so offending, is to pay 40 l. to the
King, and as much to the Party. This Action to be within 3 Months after the
Parliament commenced by the Party injured, or by any other Man who will.

In the mean time the Party returned remains a Member of the House, till his
Election be declared void by the same.

For denying the Poll when required, also for advising and abetting the same,
the guilty Party has been adjudged by the House to stand Committed to the
Sergeant during Pleasure, to pay all due Fees, to defray the Charge of
Witnesses, to be Assessed by four of the Committee, to acknowledge his Offense
upon his Knees at the Bar, and read a Submission. This was the Case of Thomson
Sheriff of York, and his Abettor Alderman Henlow, in the Reign of Charles I.

The Persons to be Elected as the fittest to answer the true Interest of the
Nation, ought to be Sober, Understanding, Well-principled, and Well-affected to
the established Government by Law. If Men of Estates, it is so much the better,
such Men being supposed to be less Corruptible. But this is left to the Peoples
Choice.

It Is true, that by Law such as stand for Knights of the Shire ought to be
Knights, Esquires, or Gentlemen fit to be made Knights.

By the Statute none ought to be chosen a Burgess of a Town in which he does
not inhabit. But the Usage of Parliament dispenses with that Act.

Neither can any be legally chosen that is not of full Age, that is, 21 Years
old at least. And reason good, for, if no Man under that Age can dispose of his
Estate, much less should he have any share in the supreme Power of the Nation,
to judge, vote, or dispose of the Estate of the Realm. Yet the Practice in the
House of Commons has often been otherwise; in the House of Lords, but seldom.

Whoever stands to be Elected must be a Native Englishman, or at least must be
Naturalized by Act of Parliament. No Alien Denizated ought to sit here.

None of the Judges can be chosen, that sit in the Bench, Common Pleas, or
Exchequer, because they are Assistants in the Lords House, But any that have
Judicial Places in other Courts Ecclesiastical or Civil, being no Lords of
Parliament, are Eligible.

No Sheriff, nor Clergyman can be chosen a Member of Parliament. Not the
first, because his personal Attendance is required within his Bayliwick, during
the time of his Sheriffalty. Nor the last, because he is of another Body, viz.
the Convocation; and the Clergy of the Convocation-House are no Part or Member
of the Parliament.

A Man attainted of Treason or Felony, etc. is not Eligible. For he ought to be
magis idon^us, discretus, and sufficiens. But a Person Outlawed in a Personal
Cause may be a Burgess. And, tho the Common Law does disinable the Party; yet
the Privilege of the House being urged prevails over the Law.

Anciently the Elected Members had a competent Allowance from the respective
County, City, or Borough, for which they served in Parliament. A Knight of the
Shire was allowed 4 shill. and a Citizen or Burgess 2 shill. a Day; which in
those Days was a considerable Sum. But then the Sessions were but short,
sometimes but eight Days, sometimes less, seldom above three or four Weeks; and
yet during that short space of time several great and weighty Affairs were
dispatched. Which (as some think) were prepared to their hand by the King and
Council, as it is now practiced in Sweden by the 40 Counselors of State, and
in Scotland by the Lords of the Articles. And, if they did only debate upon
such Things as the King did propose, a little Time might serve well enough to
do it. But it does not appear to be so by what passed Feb. 9. 1597, 39 Eliz.
When the Queen gave her Royal Assent to 24 public and 19 private Bills; but
refused 48 Bills more, which had passed both Houses. Certain it is, that there
was less Canvassing, and more Plainness in those Days, than there is at present.

The Place of Meeting for this honorable Assembly is in whatsoever City, Town,
or House the King pleases. But of latter times it has been ufually at the Kings
ancient Palace at Westminster; the Lords in a Room by themselves, and the
Commons not far from them, in another Room, which formerly was S. Stephens
Chapel.

When the Day prefixed by the King in his Writs of Summons is come, His Majesty
usually comes in person to the House of Lords, clothed with his Royal Robes,
the Crown upon his head, and the Sword of State before Him. At the upper end of
the Room is placed a Chair of State under a Canopy, upon which His Majesty sits.

Then all the Temporal Peers appear in their Scarlet Robes, every one according
to his Degree; and the Spiritual Lords, in their Episcopal Habit, which they do
all the Sessions.

On the Kings right hand, next the Wall, are placed on a Form the two
Archbishops; next below, on another Form, the Bishops of London, Durham, and
Winchester; then, upon other Forms on the same side, all the rest of the
Bishops sit, according to the priority of their Consecration.

The Lord Chancellor, or Keeper (when there is one) stands behind the Cloth of
State, or fits on the first Wool-sack, before the Chair of State, with his
Great Seal and Mace by him.

On the Kings left hand are placed the Treasurer, President of the Council, and
Lord Privy Seal, of they be Barons, above all Dukes, but those of the Royal
Family; if not Barons, then they sit uppermost on the Wool-sacks. And on the
same side sit the Dukes, Marquesses, or Earls, according to their Creation.
Cross the House, below the Wool-sacks, the first Form is that which the
Viscounts sit upon; and, upon the next Forms, the Barons, all in order.

The King being thus seated in his Throne, with this noble Appearance of the
Peers of the Realm, all standing uncovered, his Majesty sends for the Commons
from their Room where they are assembled. Who being come (at least part of
them) stand at the Bar of the Lords House. Whereupon the King makes a short
Speech to both Houses, concerning such Matters as He thinks fit to lay before
them for the Good of the Kingdom. Amongst which that of a Supply of Money is
most commonly one, in order to answer the extraordinary Charges of the Crown.

The King having ended his Speech, the Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) did formerly
use by the Kings Appointment to enlarge upon it, with all the Rhetoric and
Logic the Matter could bear, to dispose both Houses to a Compliance with the
King. But His present Majesty has declined that Method, and being a Prince of
few Words gains more upon rational Men by his concise and plain Way of
Delivery, (as the more agreeable to a true generous Nature) than perhaps he
might with all the Windings and Turnings of artificial Rhetoric.

Then the Speaker of the House of Lords commands, in the Kings Name, the
Commons to assemble in their House, there to choose one of their Members for
their Speaker, and to present him such a Day to His Majesty. Upon which the
King withdraws, and the Commons presently re-assemble themselves in the Lower
House, in order to choose one of their Members for Speaker.

Sometimes, as in the last Session, the Speaker is chosen by the Kings Command,
before fore His Majesty delivers his Speech to both Houses of Parliament.

After the Speaker is chosen, and the Choice approved by the King, His Majesty
leaves both Houses to their private Debates upon the Subject of his Speech; and
does no more appear amongst them that Session in his Royal Robes, except upon
the passing of any Act, or at the Close of the Session, whether it be by
Adjournment, Prorogation, or Dissolution. It Is true, upon any extraordinary
Debate in the House of Lords, it is customary with the Kings of England to
assist at the same; not to argue upon it, or to influence the House one way or
other, but only to hear the Arguments of the House upon the Matter in Debate.
But then the King appears without his Crown and Robes, and every Peer sits
(except when he speaks to the House) as if the King were not there.

The House of Lords, otherwise called the House of Peers, or the Upper House,
consists of 189 Members. Viz. 163 Temporal Lords, whereof 14 Dukes, 3
Marquesses, 72 Earls, 9 Viscounts, 65 Barons; and 26 Spiritual Lords, whereof 2
Archbishops, and 24 Bishops.

But the King may, by virtue of his Prerogative, increase the Number of the
Peers to sit and vote in their House, as Barons, by sending his Writs for that
pupose to whomsoever His Majesty thinks fit for that Service.

The Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper (when there is one) is of course the
Speaker of this House. Otherwise they may appoint any of their own Members, or
else one of the Judges, for that Place; as in the Case of their late Speaker,
the Right Honorable the Marquis of Hallifax, and that of Sir Robert Atkins,
Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, the present Speaker of the House of Lords.

Besides the first Wool-sack, which is the usual Seat for the Lord Chancellor
or Lord Keeper, there are other Wool-sacks; Upon which the Judges, the Kings
Council at Law, and the Masters of Chancery (not being Barons) sit, not to give
their Suffrage, but only their Advice, when required thereto. The Use of which
Wool-sacks is probably to put them in mind of the great Advantages the English
Wool has brought to this Nation, so that it may never be neglected.

On the lowermost Wool sack are placed the Clerk of the Crown, and Clerk of the
Parliament; The first being concerned in all Writs of and Pardons in
Parliament, and the other in keeping the Records of all Things passed therein.
Under this there are two Clerks, who kneeling behind the Wool-sack write upon
it.

Without the Bar of the House sits the Black Rod, so called from a black Stick
he carries in his hand, who is (as it were) the Messenger of this House. For he
is employed, amongst other Things, to call for the House of Commons to the
House of Lords upon His Majesty's Command; and to his Custody are Committed all
such Peers as the House things fit to Commit upon any Trespass. Under him is a
Yeoman Usher that waits at the Door within, a Crier without, and a Sergeant at
Mace always attending the Speaker.

The House of Commons, otherwise called the Lower house, is by much the greater
Body of the two. For, as England consists of 40 Counties, in which there are 25
Cities, 8 Cinque Ports, 2 Universities, and 168 Borough-Towns, all which are
Privileged to send Members to Par^ament, if we reckon two Members from each,
the Whole amounts to 486 Members. To which adding 24 from Wales, the Whole is
510.

It Is true, there are three Boroughs in England, each of which sends but one
Member; viz. Abington in Oxfordshire, Higham-Ferrers in Northamptonshire, and
Bewdley in Worcestershire. But these three, wanting of the Number, are made up
by the City of London, which sends four Members; and by the City of Bath, which
sends three.

Of all this great Number, many are usually absent, upon Business, or Sickness,
etc. So that, if they be three hundred met together, it is counted a pretty full
House. And, if they be but forty Members in all, they make a house.

This House, representing the whole Commons of the Realm, does generally
consist of the Flower of the Gentry; some of them Noblemens Sons, Privy
Counselors, Courtiers, Men learned in the Law, Officers and Commanders,
Merchants, etc. but most of them Gentlemen of good Estates, with the advantage
of a liberal and genteel Education. This is an aggregate Body from all Parts of
the Nation, whose Learning and Eloquence, Wit and Policy strive to outdo each
other. A ^oble School for young Gentlemen chiefly, to be versed in Things
relating to the English Government.

Here they Sit promiscuously; except the ^peaker, who has a Chair placed about
the middle of the Room, with a Table before him, the Clerk of the House sitting
near him at the Table. But none wears a Robe but the Speaker, except (as I
hinted before) the Members of Parliament for the City of London, who at their
first Meeting appear in their Scarlet Robes. Every Member wears what he fancies
most, and so do the Temporal Lords in their House, on all Days when the King
comes not thither in State. To Strangers, I confess, it looks something odd,
that so august an Assembly, vested with a Legislative Power, and met together
for the Exercise of the same, should have no proper Garb for so great a
Council, but appear in their usual Dress. But Custom has so far prevailed
against the Inconveniences that attend those Formalities, (which the English
Nebility and Gentry are generally averse from) that they are not like to be
ever balanced by the Respect and Veneration that might be gained, as in foreign
Countries, by the small trouble of them.

The usual Time for the Meeting of each House is in the Forenoon, from eight or
nine a clock till twelve or one; except Sundays, high Festivals, and Fast-Days.

These Things being premised, my next Business is to speak about the Choice of
the Speaker of the House of Commons; Who is the Mouth of the House, and so
necessary a Part thereof, that they can do no Business without him. For it is
the Speakers Part to see the Orders of the House observed, to state the Bills
that are brought in, to collect the Substance of the Debates, and the Sense of
the House upon them.

The fitst Day each Member is called by his Name, every one answering for what
Place he serves. That done, a Motion is made to choose their Speaker; who ought
to be a Person of great Ability, and is usually one of the long Robe. And, to
avoid all Delays, the Choice is commonly such as the King approves of.

This Choice is made by the Plurality of Votes. Upon which the Party chosen
desires (according to ancient Custom) to be excused from so weighty an Office,
and prays the House to proceed to a new Election. But he is commonly answered
with a full Consent of Voices upon his Name. And then two of the principal
Members go to him, and lead him from his Place to the Speakers Chair; where
being set, they return to their Places.

Then the Speaker rises, and makes a short Speech to the House, consisting of
his humble Thanks for their good Opinion of him, with Promises of his best
Endeavors for their Service.

At the Day appointed for his Presentation to the King (which is usually the
next Day) His Majesty being come to the House of Lords in his Royal Robes, and
the Lords also in their Robes, the Commons are called in. Who being come, the
Speaker is brought between two of them, with low Obeisance to the Bar, and so
presented at the Bar to His Majesty; where he makes likewise a modest Refusal.
But the King approving the Commons Choice, and not allowing of his Excuse, the
Speaker nakes an Oration to His Majesty; the Matter whereof is left to his own
Thoughts, having ^o Direction about it from the Commons. But it usually ends
with these three Petitions. First, that the Commons may have, during their
Sitting, a free Acess to His Majesty; Secondly, Freedom of Speech in their
House; And thirdly, Freedom from Arrests.

Which humble and modest Way of the Peoples addressing to the King, for His
Majesty's Assent to their ancient Privileges, is becoming the Reverence due to
the Majesty of the Prince. But it is no Argument (as some would have it) that
either the Laws thereupon made, or the Privileges so allowed, are precarious,
and may be refused them.

The Speakers Oration being answered in the Kings Name, by the Speaker of the
House of Lords, and his Petitions allowed, he with the Commons departs to the
Lower House. And then is the first time that the Mace is carried before him.
Being come to the Chair, he makes a short Speech to the House to this effect,
That, Whereas they have been pleased to choose him for their Speaker, he hopes
they will assist him in that Station, and favorably accept hi^ sincere
Proceedings for their Service.

That done, the Custom is to read, for that Time, only one Bill left unpast the
last Sessions to give him Seisin (as it were) of his Place.

In the Lords House it is observable, that, when the King is absent, the Lords
at their entrance do reverence to the Chair of State, as is (or should be) done
by all that come into the Kings Prefence-Chamber.

And then the Judges, when called in upon any Point of Law, may si^^ but may
not be Covered, till the Speaker signify unto the them Leave of the Lords. The
Kings Council and Masters of Chancery sit also, but may not to be Covered at
all. And, when the King is present, the Judges stand, till the King gives them
leave to sit.

But, we have dwelt long enough upon the Preliminaries (if I may say so) of a
Session of Parliament; and it is time to show their Proceedings, the manner of
their Debates, and Passing of Bills and Acts, which is ^hus.

First, Care is taken in each House to Vote Thanks to his Majesty for his
Gracious Speech. Then they appoint their standing Committees, of which more
afterward. And, to discover what Members are absent without just Cause or
leave of the House, the House is called from time to time thus. Every Member
whose Name is called over, uncovers his Head, and stands up at the mention of
his Name. If he be absent, he is either excused and entered accordingly; or, if
none excuse him, he is entered Defieit. Such as are present are marked; and the
Defaulters called over again the same Day, or the Day after, sometimes summoned
and sometimes sent for by the Sergeant.

If any Intruder be discovered to sit in the ^ouse, being no Member thereof, he
is pre^ently committed to the Sergeants Custody for ^^me days; and at last,
humbly begging the ^ardon of the House upon his Knees at the Bar, ^e is
Released, paying his Fees.

As to the Matter of Debates, the House (...) free to take what Latitude they
please, without confining themselves to the King's ^peech.

As they are best acquainted with the State of the Nation, and the public
Grievances, these often do take place. If any Laws are fit to be Abrogated, and
new ones Made, this is a proper Subject for them to go upon. And, whilst they
mind the Welfare of the Nation, it is to be supposed they mind that of the King.

In order to which, any Member of the House may offer a Bill for the public
Good (...) except it be for Imposing a Tax, which is not to be done but by
Order of the House first had. And he that tenders the Bill must first open the
Matter of it to the House, and offer the Reasons for admitting thereof; upon
which the House will either admit, or deny it.

But, if any member desire, that an Act made, and in force, may be Repealed or
Altered, he is first to move the House in it, and have their Resolution, before
any Bill to that purpose may be offered. If the House shall think it fit, upon
the Reasons alleged, their usual Way is to appoint one or more of the Members
to bring in a Bill for that purpose.

A private Bill, that concerns any particular Person, is not to be offered to
the House, till the Leave of the House be desired, and the substance of such
Bill made Known, either by Motion or Petition.

Petitions are usually prescribed by Members of the same County the Petitioners
are of. If they be concerning private Persons, they are to be subscribed, and
the Persons presenting them called in to the Bar, to avow the substance of the
Petition, especially if it be a Complaint against any.

The preferring of Bills, either to be Read or Passed, ly's much in the
Speaker's Power. For, though he be earnestly pressed by the House for the
Reading of some one Bill; yet, if he have not had convenient time to Read the
same over, and to make a Breviate thereof for his own Memory, he may claim a
Privilege to defer the Reading thereof to some other time. Formerly the
Speaker had liberty to call for a trivate Bill, to be Read every Morning.

The Clerk of the House is usually directed by the Speaker, and sometimes by
the House, what Bill to read, who with a loud and distinct Voice first reads
the Title of the Bill; and, after a little Pawse, the Bill it self. Which done,
Kissing his hand, he delivers the same to the Speaker. Then the Speaker stands
up uncovered, whereas otherwise he sits with his Hat on; and holding the Bill
in his hand says, This Bill is thus Entitled, and then reads the Title.
Whereupon he opens to the House the substance of the Bill; which he does,
either by trusting to his Memory, or with the help of a Breviate, filed to the
Bill.

The effect of the Bill being thus opened, he declares to the House, that it is
the first Reading of the Bill, and delivers it again to the Clerk. For every
Bill is to be Read three times, before it can be made an Act. Except a Bill of
Indemnity coming from the King, which has but one Reading in each House,
because the Subject ought to take it as the King will give it. The same it is
with a Bill of Subsidies granted by the Clergy.

At the first Read^^ of the Bill it is not usual with the House to speak to it,
or put it to the Question; but rather to take time till the second Reading, in
order to consider of it in the mean while. Nor to move for any Addition to it,
which were to imply, that the Body of the Bill is good, before it comes to a
regular Trial upon the Second Reading.

But, if any Bill originally begun in the Lower House happen, upon the first
Reading to be debated to and fro, and that upon the Debate the House do call
for the Question; the Question ought to be, not Whether the Bill shall be read
the second time (which is the ordinary Course,) but Whether it shall be
Rejected Whereas to a Bill coming from the Lords so much favor and respect is
shown, that if, upon the first Reading, it be spoken against, and pressed to be
put to the Question, the Speak^^ does not make it for Rejection, as in the
fo^mer Case, but for the Second Reading; and if that be denied, then for
Rejection. Or rather in such a Case the Speaker does forbear t^ make any
Question at all thereupon, unless (...) be much pressed thereto; it being more
prudential to consider of it, before it be put to such a hazard.

When the Question for Rejection is made, and the greater Voice is to have the
Bill Rejected, the Clerk ought to set it down Rejected in the Journal, and so
to Indorse it on the back of the Bill; and it shall be no more Read that
Session. But, if it be altered in any Point marerial, both in the Body and the
Title, it may be revived and received a second time. If the Voice be to have
the Bill Retained, then it shall have his second Reading in Course.

It Is unusual for one and the same Bill to be Read twice in one Day, ^^less
there be special Reasons for it. Yet it has been done sometimes, for want of
other Business, when the Bill was not of any great Consequence; but ^ill upon
Motion, and special Order. Also, ^hen special Committees, appointed for the
^rawing of a special Bill, have presented the same ready drawn to the House, it
has often^imes happned, that the same Bill has been twice Read, and ordered to
be Engrossed the same Day. And there are Precedents of late, that a ^ill has
been thrice Read, and Passed the same Day. By Sir Simon d'Ewes, Journ. 90. Col.
1. a Bill was Read the fourth time, before it passed the House; but this is
rare, and worth the Observation.

Though a Bill may be secondly Read the next Day after the first Reading, yet
the usual Course is to forbear for two or three Days, that Men may have more
time to consider upon ^t; except the Business requires haste.

After the Bill is secondly read, the Clerk, as before, in humble manner,
delivers it to the Speaker; who reads again the Title and his Breviate, as he
did upon the first Reading. Upon which he pawses a while, till some Member or
other of the House do speak to it. For then and not before, is the time when to
speak. And, ^f after some convenient time, no Member ^eak against the Bill,
either as to the Matter or ^orm of it, if it be a Bill originally begun in ^e
Commons House, the Speaker may make ^e Question for Engrossing thereof, that
is, ^riting of it fair in a Parchment. The same (...) may do, if diverse speak
for the Bill, with^t excepting against the Form thereof.

In short, upon the second Reading, the ^eaker having delivered the state of
the Bill, ^ebates do commonly arise upon it. After which the House usually
calls for the Commit^ng of the Bill, that is, for referring of it to a
Committee, in order to amend the Bill, which is done in this manner.

After every Speech is ended, the Speaker ought to stay a while, before he make
the Question for the Committing thereof, to see whether any Man will speak
thereto. And, when he perceives the Debate is at an end, he directs the House
in these Words; As many as are of Opinion, that this Bill shall be Committed,
say Yea. And, after the Affirmative Voice given he proceeds thus to the
Negative, As many as are of the contrary Opinion, say No. The Speaker ought by
his Ear to judge which of the Voices is the greatest; but, if the Thing be
doubtful, the House does Divide upon it. And, if upon Division of the House, it
appear that the Numbers are equal, the Speaker has the casting Voice upon all
Questions.

If the Affirmative Voice be the greater, he ought to put the House in mind
about Naming of the Committees, which is thus. Any Member of the House may be
named to be one of the Committee; and the Clerk ought in his Journal to write
under the Title of the Bill the Name of every one called for that purpose, at
least of such whose Names in that Confusion he can distinctly hear. And this he
ought to do without Partiality, either to those that name, or to the Party
named. But he that has directly spoken against the Body of the Bill may no^ be
named to be of the Committee; it being supposed, that he who is against the
Bill is no^ a proper Person to be employed for the amending (or improving) of
it.

A convenient Number being named, the Speaker puts the House in mind of the
Tim^ and Place, when and where the Committees man meet; which the Clerk ought
likewise to ente^ into his Journal Book. And, when the House is in silence, he
ought with a loud Voice to read out of his Book the Committees Names, with the
Time and Place of their Meeting, that they may take notice thereof.

When a Bill sent from the Lords is twice Read, the Question ought to be for
the Commitment. If it be denied, it ought to be Read the third time; and the
next Question, not for the Engrossing, as when the Bill begun in the ^ower
House, but for the Passing of the Bill. For all Bills that come from the Lords
come al^ays Engrossed. And, though the Question for ^he Passing of the Bill
should in Course be then ^ade, when the Bill is denied to be Committed; yet it
is not done, till the Bill be Read the third time.

As to the subject Matter of the Debates, the Speaker is not to argue for, or
against any side; but only to hear the Arguments of the House, and (as I said
before) to collect the substance of them. Neither has he any Voice, but the
Casting Voice.

Whoever speaks to a Bill ought to stand up Uncovered, and direct his Speech to
the Speaker. If two rise at the same time, and fall speaking together, the
Speaker has power to determine which shall give way to the other. He that
speaks is to be heard out, and not interrupted, unless by Mr. Speaker; which he
may do in some Cases, as when the Discourse spins out to too great a length, or
is from the Matter in hand, etc.

None ought to speak twice to a Bill in one Day, unless sometimes by way of
Explication. But, if the Bill be oftener Read than once, a Man may speak as
often as the Bill is read. And, if any Thing be done contrary to the Orders of
the House, one may rise up and speak to it in the midst of a Debate, in case
the Speaker do not. For, if the Speaker stand up, he is first to be heard; and
while he stands up, the other must sit down. But whoever rises up to speak to
the Orders of the House in the midst of a Debate must keep within that Line,
and not fall to the Matter it self. If he do, he may be taken down by the
Speaker, or any other Member, calling to the Orders of the House.

No Member in his Discourse is to mention the Name of any other then present,
but to describe him by his Title or Addition, as that Noble Lord, that Worthy
Knight. Or by his Office, as Judge, Sergeant, Gentleman of the long, or short
Robe. Or by his Place, as the Gentleman near the Chair, near the Bar, on the
other side; or that Gentleman that spoke last, or last save one, or the like.

No reviling, or reflecting Expressions must be used. And, though freedom of
Speech and Debates be an undoubted Privilege of the House, yet whatsoever is
spoken in the House is subject to the Censure of the House. But, if any speak
irreverently or seditiously against the Prince or the Privy Council, he is not
only Interrupted, but sometimes sent to the Tower.

After the Debate is ended, the Speaker ought to put the Question for
Engrossing. If the Plurality of Voices be against it, the Clerk ought to make
an Entry in his Journal, that the same was Dashed, and to make a Note of it
upon the back of the Bill, and the Day when. If for it, he must make his Entry
and Note accordingly.

A Bill that has been Committed, and is Reported, ought not in an ordinary
Course to be Recommitted, but either Dashed or Engrossed. Yet, when the Matter
is of Importance, it is sometimes Recommitted, and commonly to the same
Committee.

Some few Days after the Bill has been ordered to be Engrossed, the same being
accordingly Engrossed, is offered by the Speaker to be Read the third time, for
the Passing thereof. And, to prevent carrying of Bills with a few Voices, it
has sometimes been ordered, that no Bills should be put to the Passing until
Nine of the Clock; at which time the House is commonly full, or shortly after.

But it is Observable, that the Speaker seldom puts any one Bill to the Passing
by it self alone; for he commonly stays, till there be diverse Bills ready
Engrossed for the third Reading. And, when he has a convenient Number, (as
four, or five) he gives Notice to the House, that he purposes next Day to
offer up some Bills for the Passing, and desires the House to give special
Attendance for that purpose. Accordingly the Day following, he puts 'em to the
third Reading; first private Bills, till the House be pretty full, and then the
public ones Engrossed.

A Bill being Read the third time by the Clerk of the House, he delivers it to
the Speaker; who (as before) Reads the Title, explains the Nature of the Bill,
and then tells the House that it has now been Read thrice, and that with their
Favors he will put it to the Passing. But, before he does it, he pauseth a
while, that the Members may have liberty to speak thereto. For, upon the third
Reading, the Matter comes to a fresh Debate, and for the most part it is more
spoken unto at this time, than upon any of the former Readings. But then it is
very rare to have it Recommitted, unless it be for some particular Clause or
Proviso.

At last, the Debate being over, (the Speaker still holding the Bill in his
hand) puts it to the Passing thus; As many as are of Opinion that this Bill
should pass, say Yea. And after the Affirmative Voice given, he proceeds thus
to the Negative, As many as are of the contrary Opinion, say No. Whereupon the
Speaker is to declare his Opinion, whether the Yea's or the No's have it; and
his Opinion is to stand at the Judgment of the House, unless the Case be
doubtful, and a Motion be made for the Dividing of the House. Then the Question
is put, whether the Yea's or No's are to go out of the House. Which commonly
falls out to be the Lot of the Yea's, especially upon a new Bill; for it seems
but reasonable, that those should sit still who are for the old Law, because
they are in possession of it. To count the House, the Speaker does nominate two
of the Yea's, and two of the No's. Who, having each a Staff in his Hand, are to
count the Members that remain sitting in the House; and then to stand within
the Door, two on each side, and count the Number of them who went forth, as
they come in.

The House being thus told, the two Tellers that have the most Votes, standing
at the Bar on the right hand of the two others (the rest being all set in their
places) make their approaches together to the Table, with the usual Obeisance
to the House. He that stands on the right hand declares to the Speaker the
Number of the Yea's and No's. That done, they all depart, with like Reverence
into their Places; and Mr. Speaker makes the Report to the House.

If it be carried in the Affirmative, the Clerk is to enter the Vote, Resolved.
If in the Negative, thus; The Question being put (then he sets down the Words
of the Question) it passed in the Negative.

While the House is divided, or dividing in order to gather the Voices, no
Member is to speak, or to remove out of his Place, except such as go forth upon
the Division.

The Bill being thus passed, the Clerk (if the Bill be originally exhibited in
the House of Commons) ought to write within the Bill on the top toward the
right hand, Soit baille aux Seigneurs, that is, Let it be sent up to the Lords.
But, if the Bill passed be originally begun in the Lords House, then ought the
Clerk to write underneath the Subscription of the Lords (which always is at the
foot of the Bill) Ace Bill les Communes ont assenti.

And, when the Speaker has in his hands a convenient Number of Bills ready
passed, he then puts the House in mind of sending them up to the Lords, and
desires the House to appoint the Messengers. Amongst which a principal Member
of the House is appointed for that purpose, to whom the Bills are delivered in
such Order as he is to present them to the Lords, by the Direction of the
Speaker, except the House be pleased to give special Direction therein.

This principal Messenger, coming in the first Rank of his Company (usually
consisting of 30 or 40 Members) to the Bar of the Lords House, with three
Congies, the Lords rise from their Places, and come down to meet them at the
Bar. Then the chief Messenger tells them, that the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses of the House of Commons have sent unto their Lordships certain Bills.
Whereupon he reads the Title of every Bill, as it lies in order; and delivers
the same in an humble manner to the Speaker of the House of Lords, who is come
down of purpose to receive them.

But, when any Answer is to be delivered by the Speaker of this House, in the
name and behalf of the whole House, to such Knights and Burgesses as come from
the Commons, the Lords are to keep their Places, and the Speaker is to deliver
their Answer with his Head covered, whilst the Knights and Burgesses stand
uncovered toward the lower end of the House.

In this House the Lords give their Voices, beginning at the Puisne, or lowest
Baron, and so the rest Seriatim, every one answering apart, Content, or Not
Content; first for himself, and then severally for so many as he has Letters
and Proxies.

For any Peer of the Realm, by License of the King upon just Cause to absent,
may make a Proxy, that is, may constitute another Lord to give his Voice in the
Upper House, when any Difference of Opinion, and Division of the House shall
happen. Otherwise, if no such Division fall out, it never comes to be
questioned or Known to whom such Proxies are directed.

By an Order of this House in the Reign of Charles I, it was Ordered, that no
Peer should be capable of receiving above two Proxies, or more to be numbered in
any Cause voted.

If a Bill passed in one House, and being sent to the other, this demur upon
it, then a Conference is demanded in the Painted Chamber. Where the deputed
Members of each House meet, the Lords sitting covered at a Table, and the
Commons standing bare with great respect. There the Business is debated; and if
they cannot agree, it is nulled.

When Bills are passed by both Houses, upon three several Readings in either
House, before they can have the force of Law, they must have the Royal Assent,
which puts life into them. For, as there is no Act of Parliament but must have
the Consent of the Lords and Commons, and the Royal Assent of the King; so
whatsoever passes in Parliament by this threefold Consent, has the force of
an Act of Parliament.

The Royal Assent, which used formerly to be deferred till the last Day of the
Session, is given after this manner, whenever the King thinks fit. His Majesty
then comes into the House of Peers, with his Crown on his Head, and clothed
with his Royal Robes. Being seated in his Chair of State, and all the Lords in
their Robes, the House of Commons is sent for up (as before) by the Black Rod.
Thus the King, Lords, and Commons being met, the Clerk of the Crown reads the
Title of each Bill, and after the Reading of every Title, the Clerk of the
Parliament pronounces the Royal Assent, according to his Instructions from the
King. If it be a public Bill, to which the King assenteth, the Words are le
Roy le veut, the King wills it. Whereas to a public Bill which the King
forbears to allow, the Answer is, Le Roy S'avisera, the King will consider;
which is looked upon as a civil Denial. To a Subsidy-Bill, le Roy remercie ses
loyaux Sujets, accept leur Benevolence, and aussi le veut, the King thanks his
loyal Subjects, accepts their Benevolence, and so wills it. And to a private
Bill allowed by the King, Soit fait comme il est desire, be it done as it is
desired.

But, in case of a General Pardon, as it is the King's Gift, so the Return is
from the Lords and Commons to His Majesty in these Words, los Prelates,
Seigneurs, and Communes en ce Parliament assemblez, au nom de tous vos autres
Sujets, remercient tres humblement Votre Majeste, and prient Dieu qu'il vous
done bonne and longue Vie en Sante, the Prelates, Lords, and Commons in this
Parliament assembled in the Name of all Your other Subjects, do most humbly
thank your Majesty, and pray God to give You a good and long Life in Health.

It Is observable in the mean while, how we have retained about making of Laws,
so many French Expressions, derived to us doubtless from the Normans.

The Use of Committees is so necessary for the Dispatch of Parliament Business,
and their Way of managing Bills so fair and honorable, that it will be proper
to add something to what has been said before concerning them.

They consist of such Members as each House chooses from among them, to make a
strict Examination of the Bills, and therein such Amendments and Alterations as
their Reason will dictate upon a full Debate among themselves, and to Report
the same to the House.

Now there are three sorts of Committees, viz. Standing, Select, and Grand
Committees.

There are in the House of Commons five Standing Committees usually appointed
in the beginning of the Parliament, and remaining during all the Session. Viz.
One for Privileges and Elections, another for Religion, a third for
Grievances, another for Courts of Justice, and the fifth for Trade.

Amongst which the Committee for Privileges and Elections has always had the
Precedence, being commonly the first Committee appointed, either the same Day
the Speaker did take his Place, or the next day after. Their Power was
anciently to examine, and make Report of all Cases touching Elections and
Returns, and all Cases for Privilege as might fall out during the Parliament.
But that Power has been since abridged, especially in Matters of Privilege;
which are heard in the House, and not in a Committee, unless in some special
Cases.

By a Select Committee, I mean a Committee particularly chosen to inquire into
a Bill. In the Choice whereof this Rule is observed in the House, that they who
have given their Voice against the Body of a Bill, cannot be of the Committee.
And, though any Member of the House may be present at any select Committee, yet
he is not to give any Vote there, unless he be named to be of the Committee. As
to their Number, they are seldom less than eight, but have been sometimes many
more, and commonly Men well versed in Parliament Business.

Upon the first Meeting of a Committee in their Committee Chamber, they choose
among them a Chairman, who is much like the Speaker in the House.

After any Bill is Committed upon the second Reading, it may be delivered
indifferently to any of the Committee. Who are first to read it, and then to
consider the same by Parts. If there be any Preamble, it is usually considered
after the other Parts of the Bill. The Reason is, because upon Consideration of
the body of the Bill such Alterations may therein be made, as may also occasion
the Alteration of the Preamble, which is best done last

The Committee may not raze, interline, or blot the Bill it self; but must in a
Paper by it self set down the Amendments. Which ought to ^oe done by setting
down in the Paper the Number of the Folio where the Amendment is made, naming
the Place particularly where the Words of the Amendment are to be Inserted, or
those of the Bill Omitted. The Breviat also annexed to the Bill must be amended
accordingly, and made to agree with the Bill.

When all the Amendments are perfected, every one being Voted singly, all of
them are to be read at the Committee, and put to the Question, Whether the same
shall be Reported to the House. But, when the Vote is to be put, any Member of
the Committee may move to add to those Amendments, or to Amend any other part
of the Bill.

If the Vote of the Committee pass in the Affirmative, then commonly the
Chairman is appointed to make the Report. Which being done, that Committee is
dissolved, and can act no more without a new Power.

The usual Time for the House to receive the Reports is, after the House is
full. And it is commonly the first Thing they go then upon; unless there be
Bills Engrossed, which are to take place, and public Bills before private.

The Reporter must first acquaint the House, That he is to make a Report from
such a Committee, to whom such a Bill was Committed. Then standing in his
place, he reads each of the Amendments, with the Coherence in the Bill; opens
withal the Alterations, and shows the Reasons of the Committee for such
Amendments, until he has gone through all. When that is done, if his Seat be
not next the Floor, he must come from his Place to the Bar, and so come up to
the Table; where he delivers both the Bill and Amendments to the Clerk, to be
read. Whilst he stands by the Clerk, the Clerk reads twice the Amendments only
that are to be Inserted, and then he delivers the Bill with the Amendments to
the Speaker.

Whereupon any Member may speak against all, or any of the Amendments, and
desire the Coherence to be read. But he is to make all his Objections at once
to all the Amendments, without speaking again.

Note, that in the House of Lords, the Judges, and other Assistants there of
the long Robe, are sometimes Joined to the Lords Committees, though they have
no Voice in the House.

But whereas in the House they sit covered by the Leave of the Peers, at a
Committee they are always uncovered.

A Grand Committee, called a Committee of the whole House, is the House it self
resolved into a freedom of Debate from the Rules of the House to the Nature of
a Committee; and therefore it is commonly called a Committee of the whole House.
These Grand Committees are used, when any great Business is in hand that
requires much Debate; as Bills to impose a Tax, or raise Money from the People.
Which Bills particularly do always begin in the House of Commons, as their
Representatives.

In these Committees every Member is free to speak to one Question as often as
he shall see Cause, (which is not permitted in the House) and to answer other
Men's Reasons and Arguments. So that it is a more open Way, and such as leads
most to the Truth; the Proceeding more honorable and advantageous, both to
King and Parliament.

When the House inclines to resolve it self into a Committee, it is done by a
Question. Which being carried in the Affirmative, the Speaker leaves the Chair,
and thereupon the Committee makes choice of a Chairman. If a Dispute arises
about the Choice, the Speaker is called back to his Chair; and after the Choice
is cleared, he leaves it. The Chairman sits in the Clerks Place at the Table,
and writes the Votes of the Committee; the gathering whereof is according to
the Rules of the House.

When the Committee has gone through the Matter in hand, the Chairman, having
read all the Votes, puts the Question, That the same be Reported to the House.
If that be Resolved, he is to leave the Chair; and the Speaker being called
again to the Chair, the Chairman is to Report what has been resolved at the
Committee, standing in his usual Place. From whence, if it be not in the Seat
next the Floor, he is to go down to the Bar, and so to bring up his Report to
the Table.

In case the Committee cannot perfect the Business at that sitting, Leave is to
be asked, That the Committee may Sit at another time on that Business. But, if
the Matter has been thoroughly Debated, and is judged fit to be Resolved in the
House, the Speaker is called to the Chair for that purpose.

In other Things the Proceedings are the same as in the House. And so much for
the Committees.

I proceed now to the Manner of Adjourning, Proroguing, or Dissolving the
Parliament, which is done at the Kings Pleasure, and that in the House of
Lords, with the same Appearance and Solemnity as I have already described.

An Adjournment and Prorogation are to some convenient time appointed by the
King himself; but with this Difference, that an Adjournment does not conclude
the Session, which a Prorogation does. So that by an Adjournment all Things
debated in both Houses remain in statu quo, and at the next Meeting may be
brought to an Issue. Whereas a Prorogation makes a Session; and then such Bills
as passed either House, or both Houses, and had not the Royal Assent, must at
the next Assembly begin anew, before they can be brought to perfection.

Upon an Adjournment, or Prorogation, the King does usually make a Speech to
both Houses of Parliament. And he ought to be there in Person, or by
Representation, as on the Day of their first sitting, Now the Kings Person may
be represented by Commission under the Great Seal to certain Lords in
Parliament, authorizing them to begin, adjourn, prorogue, etc.

But it is Observable, that each House has also a Power to Adjourn themselves,
which when they do, it is at the most but for a few Days.

A Dissolution is that whereby the House of Commons becomes Vacant, in order to
a new Election. Now a Parliament may be Dissolved by the King at any time,
whether they be actually sitting, or not.

But, if a Parliament do sit, and be Dissolved, without any Act of Parliament
passed, or Judgment given, it is no Session of Parliament, but a Convention.

The King being the Head of the Parliament, if his Death happens when there is
a Parliament, it is ipso facto Dissolved.

'Twas a Custom of old, after every Session of Parliament, for the Sheriff to
Proclaim, by the Kings Command, the several Acts passed in that Session, that
none might pretend Ignorance. And yet, without that Proclamation, the Law
supposes every one has noticeby his Representative of what is transacted in
Parliament. But that Custom has been laid aside, since Printing came to be of
common Use.

The Parliament ought to sit, by Law, at least once in three Years.

Thus I have laid open the Supreme Court of England, which without the Kings
Concurrence can legally, do nothing that is binding to the Nation, but with it
can do any thing. For whatever is done by this Consent is called firm, stable,
and sanctum, and is taken for Law. Thus the King and Parliament may abrogate
old Laws, and make new, settle the Succession to the Crown, Define of doubtful
Rights whereof no Law is made, Appoint Taxes and Subsidies, Establish Forms of
Religion, Naturalize Aliens, Legitimate Bastards, Adjudge an Infant (or Minor)
to be of full Age, Attaint a Man of Treason after his Death, Condemn or Absolve
them who are put upon their Trial, Give the most free Pardons, Restore in Blood
and Name, etc. And the Consent of the Parliament is taken to be the Consent of
every Englishman, being there present in Person, or by Procuration.

King John having resigned up the Crown of England to the Pope, and submitted
to take it at his hand again at a yearly Tribute, the Pope (in the Reign of
Edward III.) demanded his Rent, and all the Arrears. Upon which issued this
Resolve of the Parliament, that neither the King, nor any other, could put the
Realm, nor the People thereof, into a foreign Subjection, without their Assent.
This was a high Resolution in Law, in one of the highest Points of Law,
concerning the Kings Claim of an absolute Power, when the Pope was in his
height. However this intimates, that with their joint Consent the Crown may be
disposed of.

But, how transcendent soever be the Power and Authority of the King and
Parliament, yet it does not extend so far as to bar, restrain, or make void
subsequent Parliaments; and, tho diverse Parliaments have attempted ^t, yet they
could never effect it. For the ^atter Parliament has still a Power to
abrogate, suspend, qualify, explain, or make void the former in the Whole, or
any Part thereof, notwithstanding any Words of Restraint, Prohibition, or
Penalty in the former; it being a Maxim in the Law of Parliament, Quod Leges
posteriores priores contrarias abrogant. 'Twas therefore but in vain, that the
late King James pretended so to settle that Liberty of Conscience which he
ushered in by his Declaration, as to make it a Law unalterable, like the Laws
of the Medes and Persians. It was but a Blind for Dissenters to bring them into
his Snare; and, tho he had really designed it, he must have been at least
Immortal to secure it.

One of the fundamental and principal Ends of Parliaments was to Redress
Grievances, and ease the People of Oppressions. The chief Care whereof is in
the House of Commons, as being the Grand Inquest of the Realm, summoned from
all Parts to present public Grievances to be redressed, and public
Delinquents punished, as corrupted Counselors, Judges, and Magistrates.
Therefore Parliaments are a great Check to Men in Authority, and consequently
abhorred by Delinquents. Who must expect one time or other to be called to a
strict and impartial Account, and be punished according to their Demerits.
Remember, said the Lord Bacon to his Friend Sr. Lionel Cranfield, when he was
made Lord Treasurer, that a Parliament will come.

In this Case the House of Commons (the Parliament sitting) Impeaches, and the
House of Lords are the Judges; the Commons Inform, Present, and Manage the
Evidence, the Lords upon a full Trial give Judgment upon it. And such is the
Privilege of the House of Commons in this particular, that they may Impeach
the highest Lord in the Kingdom, either Spiritual or Temporal; and he is not to
have the benefit of the Habeas Corpus Act (that is, he cannot come out upon
Bail) till his Trial be over, or the Parliament Dissolved, which last some of
the late Judges have declared for. But the Lords cannot proceed against a
Commoner, except upon a Complaint of the Commons.

In a Case of Misdemeanour both the Lords Spiritual and Temporal are Judges,
and the Kings Assent to the Judgment is not necessary. But, if the Crime be
Capital, the Lords Spiritual (tho, as Barons, they might sit as Judges, yet
they) absent themselves during the Trial; because, by the Decrees of the
Church, they may not be Judges of Life and Death. For, by an Ordinance made at
the Council at Westminster in 21 Hen. 2. all Clergymen were forbidden agitare
Judicium Sanguinis, upon pain to be deprived both of Dignities and Orders.

When a Peer is Impeached of High Treason, a Court is usually erected for his
Trial in Westminster Hall; and the King makes a Lord Steward (which commonly is
the Lord Chancellor) to sit as Judge thereof. The Trial being over, the Lords
Temporal resorting to their House give Judgment upon it, by Voting the Party
arraigned, upon their Honors, Guilty, or not Guilty; and he is either
Condemned, or Acquitted by the Plurality of Voices. If found Guilty, he
receives Sentence accordingly by the Mouth of the Lord High Steward.

The House of Lords is also, in Civil Causes, ^he highest Court of Judicature;
consisting of ^ll the Lords Spiritual and Temporal as Judges, ^sisted with the
most eminent Lawyers both (...) Common and Civil Law. And from this Court there
lies no Appeal, only the cause (or ^ome Point or other of it) may be brought
again before the Lords upon a new Parliament.

In Case of Recovery of Damages, or Restitution, the Parties are to have their
Remedy (the Parliament being ended) in the Chancery, and not in any inferior
Court at the Common Law. But the Lords in Parliament may direct how it shall be
levied.

In short, by the ancient Laws and Constitutions of this Kingdom, it belongs to
the House of Peers to interpret Acts of Parliament, in Time of Parliament, in
any Cause that shall be brought before Them.

I conclude with the Privileges of Parliament, which are great in both Houses,
and fit for so honorable a Court.

First, as to the Persons of the Commoners, they are Privileged from Suits,
Arrests, Imprisonments, except in Case of Treason and Felony; also, from
Attendance on Trials in inferior Courts, serving on Juries, and the like.
Their necessary Servants that tend upon them during the Parliament, are also
Privileged from Arrest, except in the aforesaid Cases. Which Privilege is
their due, eundo, morando, redeundo, that is, not only for that time the
Parliament sits, but also during 40 Days before, and 40 Days after the
Parliament finished. And that, not only for the Persons of Members, and their
necessary Servants; but also, in some Cases, for their Goods and Estates during
that Time.

Moreover this Privilege does likewise extend to such Officers as attend the
Parliament; as the Clerks, the Sergeant at Arms, the Porter of the Door, and
the like.

But, if one was Arrested before he was chosen Burgess, he is not to have the
Privilege of the House.

Many are the Precedents, which show the Resentments of this House against such
as have offered to act contrary to these Privileges, and their severe
Proceedings against some of them, either for serving a Subpoena upon, or
Arresting a Member of this House, or refusing to deliver a Member arrested for
Debt, the Parliament sitting. For common Reason will have it, that the King and
his whole Realm having an Interest in the Body of every one of its Members, all
private Interest should yield to the Public, so that no Man should be
withdrawn from the Service of the House.

And so much has been the Privilege of the House insisted on, that it has been
a Question, Whether any Member of the House could consent to be sued during the
Session; because the Privilege is not so much the Person's the House's. And
therefore, when any Person has been brought to the Bar for any Offense of this
nature, the Speaker has usually charged the Person in the name of the whole
House, as a Breach of the Privilege of this House.

Also, for offering to threaten, or to give abusive Language to any Member of
the House, or to speak irreverently of the Court of Parliament, in Time of
Parliament, several have been sent for by the Sergeant to answer it to the
House, and Committed.

Dec. 1641. it was Resolved, that the setting of any Gards about this House,
without the Consent of the House, is a Breach of the Privilege of this House,
and that therefore such Gards ought to be dismissed.

Which Resolve was followed by three others Nemine Contradicente, The first,
that the Privileges of Parliament were broken by his Majesty's taking notice
of the Bill for suppressing of Soldiers, being in agitation in both Houses,
and not agreed on. The second, that his Majesty, in propounding a Limitation
and provisional Clause to be added to the Bill, before it was presented to Him
by the Consent of both Houses, was a Breach of the Privilege of Parliament.
The third, that His Majesty expressing his Displeasure against some Persons,
for Matters moved in the Parliament, during the Debate and preparation of that
Bill, was a Breach of the Privilege of Parliament.

And, whereas in January following the King did come to the House of Commons in
a warlike manner with armed Men, some posted at the very Door of the House, and
others in other Places and Passages near it, to the Disturbance of the Members
then fitting, and treating in a peaceable and orderly manner of the great
Affairs of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland; and His Majesty, having placed
himself in the Speakers Chair, did demand the Persons of diverse Members of the
House to be delivered unto him; It was thereupon declared by the House, that
the same is a high Breach of the Rights and Privileges of Parliament, and
inconsistent with the Liberty and Freedom thereof; and therefore the House does
conceive, they could not with safety of their own Persons, or the Indemnities
of the Rights and Privileges of Parliament, sit there any longer, without a
full Vindication of so high a Breach of Privilege, and a sufficient Guard
wherein they might conside.

Lastly, both Houses of Parliament are the proper Judges of their respective
Privileges, and the inferior Courts have nothing to do with it.

CHAP. II.
Of the King's Privy Council.

NEXT to the Court of Parliament, which is the great Wheel that gives motion to
the rest, is the Kings Privy Council. A Court of great Honor and Antiquity;
Incorporated (as it were) to the King Himself, and bearing part of his Cares in
the great Bufiness of the Government. Insomuch that, upon their Wisdom, Care,
and Watchfulness depends the Honor and Welfare of His Majesty's Dominions, in
all Parts of the World. For, according to their Oath, they are chiefly to
Advise the King upon all Emergencies to the best of their Judgment, with all
the Fidelity and Secrecy that becomes their Station. And, as the King has the
sole Nomination of them, so it is his main Interest to make choice of such
eminent Persons as are best able, with their Wisdom, Experience, and Integrity,
to ^nswer those great Ends they are appointed for.

They ought to be Persons of several Capacities, that nothing be wanting for
good Counsel and Advice in a Court from whence in a great measure depends the
Safety, Honor, and Welfare of the King and Kingdom. Generally they are picked
out amongst the Nobility; and, for Things that relate to Church Affairs the
Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London use to be Members thereof.

In the late Kings Reign, not only Popish Lords were admitted contrary to Law;
but, in defiance as it were of the Nation, a Traitor by the Law, and the worst
of Counselors, a mercurial hotheaded Jesuit, whose pernicious Counsels and
Influences proved accordingly fatal to King James, and all the Popish Party.

As for the Number of Privy Counselors, it is at His Majesty's pleasure.
Anciently they used to be but twelve, or thereabouts; but, since, their Number
has increased sometimes to forty.

The Privy Council is kept in the Kings Court, or Palace, and the King himself
does commonly sit with them. The usual Days for their sitting is Wednesdays and
Fridays, in the Morning out of Parliament or Term-time, and in the Afternoon in
Parliament or Termtime. But, upon extraordinary Occasions, the King calls them
together at any time. Accordingly they wait on His Majesty in the
Council Chamger, and fit at the Council Board in their Order, bare-headed, when
the King presides. To whom His Majesty declares what He thinks fit, and desires
their Advice in it. At all Debates the lowest Counselor delivers his Opinion
first, that so he may be the more free; and the King last of all, by declaring
his Judgment, determines the Matter.

It Is with the Advice of the Privy Council, that the King puts out
Proclamations, Orders, and Declarations, which being grounded upon Statute, or
Common Law, are binding to the subject. And, upon any sudden Emergency, ^herein
the public Safety may be Endangered, ^or want of speedy Redress, the King and
Council may take a latitude of Power suitable (...) the Occasion.

Formerly the Council heard and determi^ed Causes between Party and Party. But
of ^te, lest private Causes should hinder the Public, they seldom meddle with
them, but leave ^em to the Kings Courts of Justice.

There are two distinct and important Offices ^longing to this Court. The first
is the Lord Presidents, who is one of the Nine Great officers of the Crown. He
is called Lord Pre^^dent of the Privy Council, because by his office he is in a
manner the Director of it. ^Tis he that reports to the King, when His ^ajesty
has been absent from the Council, the ^ate of the Businesses transacted there.

The other Great Office is that of Secretary, ^mmonly called a Secretary of
State; which ^rmerly was single, till about the end of Henry III. his Reign.
Who, considering the Im^rtance of this great and weighty Office, ^ought fit to
have it discharged by two Per^^ns of equal Authority, and therefore both ^ed
Principal Secretaries of State.

In those Days, and some while after (says (...) Chamberlain) they sat not at
Council Board. (...), having prepared their Business in a Room joining to the
Council Chamger, they came (...) and stood on either hand of the King; ^d
nothing was debated at the Table, until (...) Secretaries had gone through with
their Proposals. Which Method afterward was altered in Q. Elizabeth's Reign;
who seldom coming to Council ordered the two Secretaries to take their places
as Privy Counselors, which has continued ever since. And a Council is seldom
or never held, without the presence of one of them at the least.

Besides the public Concerns of the Nation, most of which pass through their
hands, they are also concerned with Grants, Pardons, Dispensations, etc.
relating to private Persons. For in their hands are lodged most of the Subjects
Requests to be represented to the King; whereupon they make Dispatches,
according to His Majesty's Directions. In short, so great is their Trust, and
their Employment of that great latitude, that it requires their constant
Attendance upon the King.

As for Home Concerns, whether public o^ private, both the Secretaries do
equally receive and dispatch whatever is brought to them. But, for foreign
Affairs, each has his distinct Province; receiving all Letters and Address
from, and making all Dispatches to the severa^ Princes and States in his
Province.

They keep each of them his Office (called the Secretaries Office) at
Whitehall: Where they have also Lodgings for their own Accommodation, and those
that attend upon it; wh^ a liberal Diet at the Kings Charge, or Board wages in
lieu of it. Their settled Allowanc^ is little less than 2000 l. a Year to each
(...) them; besides Perquisites.

The Secretaries and Clerks they employ under them are wholly at their own
choice, an^ have no Dependence upon any other.

Lastly, they have the Custody of the Signet, one of the Kings Seals. To which
belongs the Signet-Office, where four Clerks wait Monthly by turns, preparing
such Things as are to pass the Signet, in order to the Privy Seal, or Great
Seal. He that is in waiting is always to attend the Court, wheresoever it
removes; and to prepare such Bills or Letters for the King to sign (not being
Matter of Law) as by Warrant from the King, or Secretaries of State, or Lords
of the Council he is directed to prepare. And to this Office all Grants
prepared by themselves, or the Kings Learned Council at Law, for the Kings
hand, are returned, when signed, and there transcribed again. The Transcription
is carried to one of the Principal Secretaties of State, to be sealed with the
Signet. This done, it is directed to the Lord Privy Seal, and is his Warrant
for issuing out a Privy Seal upon it. But then it must be first transcribed by
the Clerks of the Seal, who are also four in Number; and, when it has the Privy
Seal affixt, it is sufficient for the Payment of any Moneys out of the
Exchequer, and for several other Uses. If the Grant requires the passing the
Great Seal, as several Grants do, the Privy Seal is a Warrant to the Lord
Chancellor (or the Lords Commissioners) to pass it, as the Signet was to the
Lord Privy Seal. But here also a new Transcription must be made of the Grant.
The Reason why a Grant must go through so many Hands and Seals, before it can
be perfected, is, that it may be duly considered, and all Objections cleared,
before it take its effect.

The Paper-Office, at Whitehall, is also depending on the Secretaries of State.
Where all the Papers and Dispatches that pass through their Offices (as Matters
of State and Council, Letters, Intelligences, and Negotiations of foreign
Ministers here, or of the Kings Ministers abroad) are from time to time
transmitted, and there remain, disposed by way of Library. The Keeper whereof
has a yearly Salary of 160 l. payable out of the Exchequer.

To conclude, the Lords of the Privy Council have always been of such high
value and esteem, that if a Man did but strike another in a Privy Counselors
House, or elsewhere in his presence, he was fined for the same. To conspire the
Death of any of them was Felony in any of the Kings Servants, and to kill one
of them was High Treason.

A Privy Counselor, though but a Gentleman, has precedence of all Knights
Baronets, and younger Sons of all Barons and Viscounts. And a Secretary of
State has this special Honor, that, if he be a Baron, he takes place (as such)
of all other Barons. So honorable an Employment it is, that in the late Reign
the Earl of Sunderland, was both principal Secretary of State, and Lord
President of the Privy Council.

CHAP. III.
Of the High Court of Chancery, otherwise called the Court of Equity.

I come now to the Courts of Judicature held at Westminster, viz. the Courts of
Chancery, Kings Bench, Common Pl^as, Exchequer, and Duchy of Lancaster;
whereof the three first are held at Westminster Hall, the Common Pleas near the
Gate, the Chancery and Kings Bench at the further end of the Hall.

All the forementioned Courts are opened four times a Year, called the four
Terms; Viz. Easter, Trinity, Michaelmas, and Hilary Term.

Easter-Term begins always the 17th Day after Easter, and lasts 27 Days.
Trinity (or Midsummer) Term begins the fifth Day after Trinity Sunday, and
lasts 20 Days. Michaelmas-Term begins the 23th of October, and lasts 37
Days. And Hilary-Term (so called from S. Hilary a Bishop) begins the 23 of
January, and lasts 21 Days.

Next to the Parliament of England, and the Kings Privy Council, by whose
Influences the Nation is chiefly governed under the King, the High Court of
Chancery is the chief, and the most ancient Court of Judicature. Otherwise
called the Court of Equity, in opposition to other inferior Courts, the Judges
whereof are tied to the Letter of the Law; Whereas this is a Court of Mercy, in
which the Rigor of the Law is tempered with Equity. And therefore the Kings of
England would have this Court Superior to the other Tribunals, as well as for
being the Original of all other Courts, and the Fountain of all our Proceedings
in Law. For, as Sir Edward Coke says, this Court is Officina Justitiae, out of
which all Original Writs and all Commissions which pass under the Great Seal go
forth, which Great Seal is Clavis Regni, the Key of the Kingdom; and for those
ends this Court is always open.

In the Chancery are two Courts, one Ordinary, and the other Extraordinary. In
the first the Proceedings are in Latin, Secundum Legem and Consuetudinem
Angliae, according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. In the second, by
English Bill, Secundum aequum and bonum, according to Equity.

The Manner of Proceeding is much like that in the Courts of the Civil Law; the
Actions by Bill or Plaint, the Witnesses examined in private, and the Decrees
in English or Latin, not in French. No Jury of twelve Men, but all Sentences
given by the Judge of the Court.

The Judge is the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, the
highest Dignity that a Layman is capable of in England, and held of the King
durante Beneplacito. But now this Office is executed by three Lords
Commissioners.

Next to whom there are twelve Assistants called Masters of the Chancery, who
are Civilians. Their Salary is each 100 Pound, paid out of the Exchequer
quarterly, besides Robe-mony. Three of these at a time sit in the Chancery
Court in Term-time, and two out of Term, when the Chancellor sits to hear
Causes at his own House Who often refers to them the further hearing of Causes,
etc. These Masters have a public Office, where one or more of them do
constantly attend, to take Affidavits, etc.

The chief of them is the Master of the Rolls, whose Place is both very
honorable and beneficial. The same is in the King's Gift, either Life, or
during his Majesty's Pleasure. And he is called Master of the Rolls, as having
the Custody of all Charters, Patents, Commissions, Deeds, and Recognizances,
which being made up in Rolls of Parchment, gave Occasion for that Name. From
whence the ver^ House where the same are Kept is also called (...) Rolls;
which, being founded at first for the converted Jews, was, after their
Expulsion out of England, annexed for ever to the Office of Master of the Rolls.
Here are kept all the Rolls since the beginning of Richard the Third's Reign;
and the former Rolls, in the Tower.

In this House the Master of the Rolls may Jure Off^cii, and by virtue of a
Commission, hear Causes, with two Masters, and without the Chancellor. He has
in his Gift those considerable Offices of the Six Clerks in Chancery, the
Examiners Offices, three Clerks of the Petty-bag, and the six Clerks of the
Rolls Chapel, where the Rolls are kept.

In Parliament-time, when he sits in the House of Lords, he sits upon the
Second Woolsack, next to the Lord Chief Justice of Engand.

Next in degree to the Twelve Masters in Chancery are the Six Clerks aforesaid,
who keep their several Offices at a Place called the Six Clerks Office in
Chancery Lane, and constantly Keep Commons together in Term-time. Their
Business is for the English part of this Court, to inroll Commissions, Pardons,
Patents, Warrants etc. that are passed the Great Seal. They are also Attorneys
for Plaintiffs and Defendants, in Causes depending in this Court.

Under these are Sixty other Clerks, viz. ten to each; amongst which some get
four, or five hundred Pounds a Year, and some more. These also have their
Under-Clerks, who dispatch with them the Business of this Office.

For the Latin Part, there is the Cursitors Office, Kept near Lincolns Inn. Of
these there are 24, whereof one Principal, and two Assistants. Their Business
is to make out Original Writs, for which purpose each of them has certain
Counties and Cities allotted to him, into which he makes out such Original
Writs as are required. These Clerks are a Corporation of themselves, who
execute their Offices by themselves or Deputies.

There are several Officers besides, belonging to the Chancery. As the Clerk of
the Crown; Who, either by himself or Deputy, is continually to attend the Lord
Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, for special Marters of State, and has a Place in
the House of Lords. He makes all Commissions of Peace, of Oyer and Terminer,
Jail-delivery, and upon the Death or Removal of any Members of Parliament
sitting, makes all Writs for New Elections.

There is also a Protonotary, whose Office is chiefly to dispatch Commissions
for Embassies; A Register of the Court of Chancery, and two Registers for the
Rolls.

The Clerk of the Hamper, or Hanaper; Who receives all the Money due to the King
for the Seals of Charters, Patents, Commissions, and Writs. In Term-time, and
at all times of Sealing, he attends the Chancery-Court, with all Sealed
Charters, Patents, etc. put up in Leathern Bags. Instead of which, Hampers were
probably used in our Forefathers time, and the Clerk called from thence Clerk
of the Hamper. Those Bags are delivered by the Clerk to the Comptroller of the
Hamper.

Three Clerks of the Petty-Bag, whose Office is to make all Patents for
Customers, Comptrollers, all Conge d'Eslires, first Summons of Nobility,
Clergy, Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses to Parliament, etc.

The six Clerks of the Rolls Chapel, which togethe^ with the Clerks of the
Petty-bag are under the Master of the Rolls. And so are the Two E^^caminers,
whose Office is to examine the Witnesses on their Oaths in any Suit on both
sides.

A Clerk of the Patents, another of the Reports, and a Clerk (or Secretary) of
the Presentation of Spiritual Benefices.

There is besides a Subpoena Office, to issue out Writs or Summons for Persons
to appear in Chancery. Another Office, for filing all Affidavits in the Court
of Chancery. Besides the Alienation Office, to which are carried all Writs of
Covenant and Entry, (whereupon Fines are levied, and Recoveries suffered) to
have Fines for Alienation set and paid thereupon. This Office is executed by 3
Commissioners, who set those Fines

The Warden of the Fleet, or Keeper of the Fleet-Prison, is a considerable
Office. His Business is to take care of the Prisoners there, who are commonly
such as are sent thither from this Court, for Contempt to the King or his Laws;
though there are others, upon the Account of Debts, etc.

There is also a Sergeant at Arms, whose Office is to bear a gilt Mace before
the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper.

Lastly, whereas other Courts of Justice are never open but in Term-time, this
is at all times open. For, if a Man be wrongfully Imprisoned in the Vacation,
the Lord Chancellor may grant a Habeas Corpus, and do him Justice according to
Law, as well in Vacation as in Term-time. Which is not in the Power either of
the King's Bench, or Common Pleas, to do in the Vacation. This Court likewise
may grant Prohibitions at any time, either in Term or Vacation.

CHAP. IV.
Of the Court of Kings Bench.

THis Court is called the Kings Bench, because in it are handled all Pleas of
the Crown; as all manner of Treasons, Felonies, Misprision of Treason, etc.

But it has Power besides to examine and correct all Errors in fait, and in
Law, of all the Judges and Justices of the Realm in their Judgments and
Proceeding in Courts of Record; and this not only in Pleas of the Crown, but in
all Pleas real, personal, and mixed, the Court of Exchequer excepted.

This Court has also Power to correct other Errors and Misdemeanors
extrajudicial, tending to the Breach of the Peace, or Oppression of the
Subject. It grants Prohibitions to Courts Temporal and Ecclesiastical, to Keep
them within their proper Jurisdiction; and may bail any Person for any Offense
whatsoever. If a Freeman in City, Borough, or Town Corporate, be Disfranchised
unjustly, this Court may relieve the Party, although he has no Privilege in it.

This Court moreover has power to hold Plea by Bill for Debt, Detinue,
Covenant, Promise, and all other personal Actions, against any that is in the
Marshals Custody, or any Officer, Minister, or Clerk of the Court. For, if they
should be sued in any other Court, they would be allowed the Privilege of
this, in respect of their necessary Attendance here; and, lest there should be
a failure of Justice, they shall be Impleaded here by Bill, though these
Actions be common Pleas. Likewise the Officers, Ministers, and Clerks of this
Court, privileged by Law, may Implead others by Bill here in the foresaid
Actions.

In short, the Jurisdiction of this Court is general, and extends all over
England. It Is more uncontrolable than any other Court, because the Law presumes
the King to be there in person. For anciently the Kings of England sat
sometimes in this Court, and that on a high Bench, his Judges at his Feet, on a
low Bench. From whence some think this Court came to be called the King's
Bench. However the Judicature always belonged to the Judges, and in the King's
presence (as now in his absence) they answered all Motions, etc.

So Supreme is also the Jurisdiction of this Court, that, if any Record be
removed hither, it cannot (being as it were in its Center) be remanded back,
but by an Act of Parliament.

In this Court sit commonly four Grave Reverend Judges, The principal whereof
is called the Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and is thus created by
Writ. A. B. Militi Salutem. Sciatis quod Constituimus Vos Judiciarium nostrum
Capitalem, ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito nostro. Test
meipso apud Westminster.

The rest of the Judges of the King's Bench hold their Places by Letters Patent
in these Words. Rex omnibus ad quos praesentes Litera pervenerint, Salutem.
Sciatis quod Constituimus dilectum and fidelem B. C. Militem unum
Justiciariorum, ad Placita coram nobis tenenda, durante Beneplacito nostro.
Test, etc.

Though in the Writ or Patent made to these Judges they are not named
Sergeants, yet none can be a Judge of this Court, unless he be a Sergeant of
the Degree of the Coif, that is, a Sergeant at Law; who, upon taking this
Degree, is obliged to wear a Lawn Coif under a black Cap.

These Judges, or Justices, are the Sovereign Justices of Oyer and Terminer,
Jail-delivery, Conservators of the Peace, etc. in the Realm. So that, when this
Court comes and sits in any County, the Justices of Eire, of Oyer and Terminer,
and Jail-delivery, etc. are ipso facto void, without writing to them. They are
likewise the Sovereign Coroners of the Land; and therefore where the Sheriff
and Coroners may receive Appeals by Bill, much rather the Justices of this
Court may do it.

Their Salary from the King is each 1000 l. per Annum, besides Robes and
Liveries out of the great Wardrobe, and two Tun of Wine to the Lord Chief
Justice.

In this Court all young Lawyers that have been called to the Bar are allowed
to practice.

Here are three distinct Offices; Viz. the Crown Office, the Protonotaries, and
the Custos Brevium's Office.

To the first belong, the Clerk of the Crown, a Secondary, and several entering
Clerks. The first is a Cap-Officer, who sits covered in Court. The entering
Clerks have Counties assigned them, and usually are Attorneys for Defendants
prosecuted at the King's Suit.

To the second belongs the Protonotary, a Cap-Officer, to whom belong all
Clerks of the Pleaside; his Secondary, and Deputy for signing Writs, a Clerk
for filing Declarations, a Clerk of the Remembrances, a Clerk of the Bails and
Posteas.

To the Custos Brevium's Office belongs the Custos Brevium and Recordorum, a
Cap-Officer, who is also Clerk of the Essoins and Warrants of Attorney; two
Clerks, one of the Inner, and the other of the outward Treasury, who are all
Officers for Life.

There are besides two Book-Bearers, who carry the Records into Court, a
Marshal or Keeper of the King's Bench Prison, who has a Deputy, a Clerk of the
Papers, a Clerk of the Rules, and his Deputy, a Clerk of the Errors, and his
Deputy, a Sealer of Writs, a Head-Crier, two Under-Criers, two Ushers, and four
Tip-staves.

Lastly, there are several Filazers for the several Counties of England, who
make out all Process upon Original Writs, Actions personal, and mixed.

CHAP. V.
Of the Court of Common Pleas.

THis Court is so called, because here are debated the usual Pleas between
Subject and Subject. For in this Court all Civil Causes, real and personal, are
usually tried, according to the strictness of the Law. And real Actions are
pleadable; nor Fines levied, or Recoveries suffered, in no other Court but
this. Which may also grant Prohibitions, as the Court of the King's Bench does.

Here are also commonly four Judges, the chief whereof is called the Lord Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas, or of the Common Bench. Who holds his Place by
Letters Patent, as the other Three do, derante Beneplacito. Their Fee is the
same as that of the King's Bench Judges.

None but Sergeants at Law may plead in this Court; and so many of them as the
King shall appoint, are bound by Oath to assist all that have any Cause
depending here; for which the King allows them Fees, Reward, and Robes.

Many are the Officers belonging to this Court. The principal whereof is the
Custos Brevium, who is the first Clerk of the Court, and whose Office is to
receive and keep all Writs returnable here, to receive of the Protonotaries all
the Records of Nisi-prius, called Posteas. He holds his Place by Patent from
the King, has the Gift of the second Protontaries Place, and of the Clerk of
the Juries.

Then Three Protonotaries, who enter and inroll all Declarations, Pleadings,
Assizes, Judgments, and Actions, and make out Judicial Writs. In whose Offices
all the Attorneys of this Court enter their Causes.

Now each of them has a Secondary, who draws up the Rules of Court, etc. And
these Secondaries are commonly the ablest Clerks or Attorneys of the Court.

There is also a Chirographer, whose chief Business is to ingross Fines
acknowledged; and for whose Office there is a Register, and several Clerks,
having their several Counties allotted them, for which they Ingross the Fines
levied of Lands in their respective Divisions.

All which forementioned Officers are Sworn, and hold their Offices for Life,
as a Freehold. They sit in the Court covered with black round Caps, such as
were in fashion before the Invention of Hats.

Moreover, there are in this Court three Officers unsworn, who hold their
Places durante Beneplacito. Viz. 1. A Clerk of the Treasury, whose Office is in
the Gift of the Lord Chief Justice. He Keeps the Records of this Court, and
makes out (amongst other Things) all Records of Nist Prius. 2. The Clerk of the
Inrollments of Fines and Recoveries, who is by Statute under the three Puisne
Judges of this Court, and removable at their Pleasure. 3. The Clerk of the
Outlawries; who, after the Party is returned Outlawed, makes out the Writs of
Capias Uelegatum, in the name of the Attorney General, to whom this Office does
properly belong, and who exercises it by Deputy.

There is besides a Clerk of the Warrants, who enters all Warrants of Attorney
for Plaintiff and Defendant, and inrolls all Deeds acknowledged before any of
the Judges of the Common Pleas.

The Clerk of the King's Silver, to whom every Fine (or final Agreement upon
Sale of Land) is brought, after it has been with the Custos Brevium, and to
whom Money is paid for the King's Use.

The Clerk of the Juries, who makes out the Writs called Habeas Corpus, and
other Writs for appearance of the Jury.

The Clerk of the Essoins, or Excuses for lawful Cause of Absence.

And the Clerk of the Supersedeas, who makes out the Writs of Supersedeas,
which formerly was done by an Exigenter.

Here are also 15 Filazers for the several Counties of England; who (amongst
many other Things) make out all Process upon Original Writs. These are in the
Gift of the Lord Chief Justice, and hold for Life. As also

The four Exigenters; whose Office is to make all Exigents and Proclamations in
all Actions where Process of Outlawry does ly. Now an Exigent is a Writ so
called, because it requires the Parties Appearance to answer the Law, and lies
against a Transgressor of the Law that cannot be found, nor any of his Goods
within the County. Whereupon he is Summoned by the Sheriff at five several
County Courts; and, if he appear not, he is Outlawed, that is, excluded from
the Protection of the Law. Which looks upon him as unworthy of it, that acts in
contempt of the Law.

Lastly, there are four Criers, and a Porter, belonging to this Court.

CHAP. VI.
Of the Courts of Exchequer, and Duchy of Lancaster.

THese two I join together, because they both concern the King's Revenue, and
take Cognizance of all Causes arising from it.

The Judges of this Court are called Barons of the Exchequer, ever since Barons
of the Realm used to sit here as Judges; though in latter times Men learned in
the Law have usually filled up this Station. They are commonly four that sit in
this Tribunal, as in the two former Courts; the principal whereof is styled
Lord Chief Baron. But it is to be observed, that the Lord Treasurer and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, may sit here as Principal, though they seldom do
it.

The Lord Chief Baron is created by Letters Patents, to hold this Dignity,
Quamdiu se been gesserit, which the Law intends for Life; so that he is better
fixed than either of the Chief Justices. His Place is of great Honor and
Profit. In Matter of Law, Information, and Plea, he answers the Bar, and gives
Order for Judgment thereupon. He alone in the Term-time does sit upon Nisi
prius, that come out of the King's Remembrancer's Office, or out of the Office
of the Clerk of the Pleas, which can not be dispatched in the Mornings for want
of time. He takes Recognizances for the King's Debts, for Appearances, and
Observing of Orders. He takes the Presentation of all Officers in Court under
himself, and of the Mayor of London, and sees the King's Remembrancer to give
them their Oaths. He also takes the Declaration of certain Receivers Accounts
of the Lands of the late Augmentation made before him by the Auditors of the
Shires, and gives two Parcel-makers Places by virtue of his Office.

In his absence, his Place is supplied by the other three Barons, his
Assistants, according to their Seniority.

These Judges, and those of the two former Courts of King's Bench and Common
Pleas, make up the Number of Twelve; who all sit in on their Tribunals in
Robes, and square Caps.

Next to the four Barons of this Court, is first the Cursitor, who administers
the Oath to the Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Searchers, Surveyors, etc.
of the Custom-House.

Then the King's Remembrancer, in whose Office are entered the States of all
Accounts whatsoever concerning the King's Revenue, except Sheriffs and Bailiffs
Accounts. Here also are taken all Securities, either by Bonds or Recognizances
to the King, for the faithful Performance of those Persons employed in the
Collecting of his Majesty's Revenue, and for the Payment of his Debts. And all
Proceedings upon the said Bonds or Recognizances, or any other Bonds taken in
the Kings Name by Officers thereunto appointed under the Great Seal of England,
besides all Proceedings upon any Statute by Information for Custom, Excises, or
any other Penal Law concerning the Kings Revenue, are transmitted hither for
the Recovery thereof, and properly belong to this Office. From whence
accordingly issue forth Process, to cause all Accountants to come in, and
account. And, as the Exchequer does consist of two Courts, the one of Law, and
the other of Equity, all Proceedings touching the same are in this Office, with
many other Things relating to the Kings Revenue. To this Office, being in the
Kings Gift, belong eight sworn Clerks, whereof the two first are called
Secondaries.

The Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, who makes Process against all Sheriffs,
Receivers, Bailiffs, etc. for their Accounts; and into whose Office all
Charters and Letters Patents, upon which any Rents are reserved to the King,
are transcribed and sent by the Clerk of the Pettibag. Out of this Office
Process is made to levy the Kings Fee-Farm Rents, etc. This Office is likewise
in the Kings Gift, and there are several Clerks belonging to it, the two first
being distinguished from the rest by the Name of Secondaries.

The Remembrancer of the First Fruits and Tenths, who takes all Compositions
for the same, and makes Process against such as do not pay them. He has two
Clerks under him.

The Clerk of the Pipe, who receives into his Office all Accounts which pass
the Remembrancer's Office. He makes Leases of the Kings Lands and extended
Lands, when he is ordered so to do by the Lord Treasurer and Chancellor of the
Exchequer, or the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. He has under him 8 sworn
Clerks, by whom all Accounts of Sheriffs and Bailiffs are made up; and, when
the Accounts are even, he gives the Accomptants their Quie^us est. All Tallies
which vouch the Payments contained in such Accounts are examined and allowed by
the chief Clerk in the Pipe, called the Secondary.

The Comptroller of the Pipe, who writes out the Summons twice every Year to
the high Sheriffs, to levy the Debts charged in the great Roll of the Pipe. He
also writes in his Roll all that is in the great Roll, and nothing entered in
this can be discharged without his privity.

The Foreign Opposer, whose Office is to oppose all Sheriffs upon the Schedules
of the Green Wax. This Office is kept in Gray's Inn.

The Clerk of the Pleas, in whose Office all the Exchequer Officers, and other
Debtors to the King, are to plead and be impleaded, as at the Common Law. The
Reason why it is done here is, because their Attendance is required in this
Court. And therefore here are four sworn Attorneys.

The Clerk of the Estreats, who receives every Term the Estreats (or Extracts)
out of the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer's Office, and ^rites them out to be
levied for the King. He ^lso makes Schedu^es of such Sums as are to be
^ischarged.

A Clerk of the Parcels, and another of the ^ichils.

Two Auditors of the Impressed, who Audit the great Accounts of the Kings
Custo^s, Wardrobe, ^int, First Fruits and Tenths, Naval and Mi^tary Expenses,
Moneys Imprested, etc.

Seven Auditors of the Revenue, who Audit all Accounts of the Kings Lands
Revenue, and all Taxes granted by the Parliament.

There are also several Receivers of the Kings Revenues, arising from Lands and
Rents, whose Accounts are yearly made up by the Auditors.

To which add a Receiver of the First Fruits Revenue. As for the Tenths, the
Bishops are Collectors of them, and account yearly for the same.

But there are two other considerable Officers, not to be omitted, viz. the
Deputy Chamberlains. In whose Office at Westminster are preserved all the
Counterfoils of the Tallies; ranged by Months and Years, and by that means
easily found out, to be joined with their respective Stock or Tally.

There is also the chief Usher of the Exchequer; an Office of Inheritance, four
Vnder-Vshers, a Marshal, and six Messengers.

As to the Court of the Duchy of Lancaster, also kept at Westminster, it
concerns particularly the Revenue belonging to that Duchy, long since annexed
to the Crown.

The chief Judge of this Court is the Chancellor of the Duchy, assisted by
the Attorney of the same.

Next to whom is the Receiver General, the Vice Chancellor of the Duchy, the
two Auditors; the Clerk of the Duchy, and a Messenger.

CHAP. VII.
Of the Sheriffs, and their two Courts, called the County Court, and the
Sheriffs Turn; of Justices of Peace, and their Quarter Sessions; with an
Account of the Grand Jury; of the Coroners, Clerks of the Markets, and their
Courts.

FOR the Civil Government of Counties, Cities, Towns, and Villages, there are
diverse Officers, to whom belong several Courts for the due Administration of
Justice.

First in every County (except Durham and Westmorland) there is a Sheriff,
which is a yearly Office, the Power whereof extends all over the County, except
such Cities and Towns as are Counties of themselves, that is, which have the
Privilege of Counties. In Middlesex only there are two Sheriffs, upon the
account of London the Capital City of the Kingdom.

The Sheriffs were heretofore chosen, as Knights of the Shire, by the Suffrages
of the People: But now they are appointed by the King, after this manner. First
the Judges nominate six fit Men of each County, that is, Knights or Esquires of
good Estates. Out of that Number three are chosen by the Privy Counselors, and
the twelve Judges assembled in the Exchequer, and there sworn in order to it.
And out of this Number the King himself chooses whom he thinks fit.

Heretofore the same Sheriff served many years together, and to this day this
Office is hereditary to the Cliffords in the County of Westmorland, by Charter
from King John.

The Sheriffs Office is both Ministerial, and Judicial. As Ministerial, he is
to execute the Kings Mandates, and all Writs directed to him out of the Kings
Courts, to Impannel Juries, to bring Causes and Criminals to Trial, and to see
the Sentences executed. In short, there is no Execution of the Law but by the
Sheriff, for by him all Suits begin, and all Process served. He is likewise to
collect all public Profit, as Taxes, Fines, Distresses, and Amerciaments into
the Kings Exche quer, or wherever the King shall appoint; and to make such
Payments out of it, as he shall have due Order for. At the Assizes he is to
wait on, and guard the Itinerant Judges, so long as they continue within the
County.

As to the Judicial Part of his Office, he holds, by virtue thereof, two
several Courts; the one called the County Court, and the other the Sheriffs
Turn.

The County Court is held every Month by the Sheriff himself, or his Deputy the
Under Sheriff wherein he hears and determines Civil Causes of the County under
40 shillings, which anciently was a considerable Sum. But this is no Court of
Record.

The Sheriffs Turn is held twice a Year, viz. within a month after Easter, and
within a mont^ after Michaelmas. In this Court he inquire of all Criminal
Offenses against the Common Law, wherein he is not restrained by any Statute.
For all the Bishops, Earls, Barons, and all such as have Hundreds of their own
to be kept, are exempted from the Jurisdiction of this Court. In short, this is
a Court of Record, in all Things that belong to it. It Is the Kings Leet through
all the County, whereof the Sheriff is Judge, this Court being incident to his
Office.

The Justices of Peace, anciently called Wardens (or Gardians) of the Peace,
are such amongst the Gentry (and sometimes amongst the Clergy) as are appointed
by the Kings Commission to attend the Peace of the County where they dwell.

Their Original is from the first year of Edward the III, but they were not
called Justices till the 36th Year of his Reign.

Their Office is to call before them, examine, and commit to Prison Rioters,
wandering Rogues, Thieves, Murderers, false Moneyers, those that hold
Conspiracies, and almost all Delinquents that may occasion the Breach of Peace
and Quiet to the Kings Subjects, and to see them brought forth in due time to
Trial.

If any one Swears himself to be in danger of his Life upon the Threats of
another, he may bind him over to his good Behavior, and the Justice shall
commit him to Prison, unless the finds good Security for his good Behavior
during a Year and a Day.

Among the Justices of Peace, the Number whereof is as His Majesty thinks fit,
there are some particularly called Justices of the Quorum, from these Words in
the Commission, Quorum A.B. unum esse volumus. As for Example, Where a
Commission is directed to seven Persons, or any three of them Whereof A.B. and
C.D. to be two, these are said to be of the Quorum, because the rest cannot
proceed without them. So that a Justice of Peace and Quorum is one without whom
the rest of the Justices in some Cases cannot proceed.

Every Quarter, or three Months, the Justices of each County meet at the chief
(or Shire) Town; from whence this Court came to be called the Quarter Sessions.
Where the Grand Inquest (or Jury) of the County is summoned to appear; who upon
Oath are to inquire of Malefactors, Rioters, and suspected Persons.

The G and Jury does commonly consist of 24 grave and substantial Gentlemen, or
some of the better sort or Yeomen, chosen indifferently (or at least ought so
to be) by the Sheriff out of the whole Shire, to consider of all Bills of
Indictment preferred to the Court. Which Bills they do either approve by
Writing upon them Billa Vera, or disallow by indorsing Ignoramus. Presently
upon the Allowance of a Bill, the Party concerned is said to be Indicted, and is
committed to Prison. But what Bills are Disallowed are delivered to the Bench,
by whom they are forthwith cancelled or torn. If the approved Bills touch Life
and Death, they are further referred to another Jury to be considered of,
because the Case is of such Importance; but others of lighter moment are
proceeded upon by fining the Delinquents, without any more ado. Unless the
Party traverse the Indictment, or challenge it for Insufficiency, or remove the
Cause to a higher Court by Certiorari; in which two former Cases it is referred
to another Jury, and in the latter transmitted to a higher Court. In short, the
Trial is usually referred to the next Assizes, when the Judges at Westminster
go their Circuits.

Originally this Court seems to have been erected only for Matters touching the
Peace, but now it extends much further. The Sheriff, or his Undersheriff, is
bound to attend upon this Court, with his Constables, Bailiffs, etc.

There are also in every County commonly four Officers, called Coroners
(vulgarly pronounced Crowners) because they deal principally with Pleas of the
Crown, or Matters concerning the Crown. His Office is to Inquire by a Jury of
Neighbors how and by whom any Person came by a violent Death, and to enter the
same upon Record. And, whereas the Sheriff in his Turn may inquire of all
Felonies by the Common Law, except a Man's Death; the Coroner can inquire of no
Felony but of the Death of Man, and that super visum Corporis, upon view of the
Body. Which Inquisition of Death taken by him he ought to deliver at the next
Jail-delivery, or certify the same into the Kings Bench. Therefore he ought to
put in writing the ^ffect of the Evidence given to the Jury before him, and has
power to bind over Witnesses to the next Jail-delivery in that Coun^y.

For doing his Office, he is to take nothing, upon grievous Forfeiture. But by
3 H. 7. he (...) to have upon an Indictment of Murder 13 s. d. of the Goods of
the Murderer.

But, besides his Judicial, he has likewise a ^inisterial Power as a Sheriff.
As, when there (...) just Exception taken to the Sheriff, Judicial Process
shall be awarded to the Coroners for the execution of the Kings Writs, in which
Cases he is locum tenens Vicecomitis, or supplies the Sheriffs place. And in
some special Case the Kings Original Writ shall be immediately directed unto
him.

There are, as I said before, commonly four of these Officers in every County
of England. But Cheshire has but two, and each Shire in Wales has no more.

The same are chosen by the Freeholders of the County, by virtue of a Writ out
of the Chancery; and continue, notwithstanding the Demise of the King, in their
Office. Which was of old in so great esteem, that none could have it under the
degree of a Knight. And, by the Writ De Coronatore eligendo, the Party to be
chosen must have sufficient Knowledge and Ability to execute this Office; which
is implied in these Words, Et talem eligi facias qui melius sciat and possit
Officio illi intendere. After he is elected, the Sheriff is to take his Oath,
only to execute his Office. And the Court which he holds is a Court of Record.

Every County also has an Officer called Clerk of the Market. Whose Office is
to keep a Standard of all Weights and Measures, exactly according to the Kings
Standard kep^ in the Exchequer, and to see that none other be used in the same
County. He is to seal a^ Weights and Measures made exactly by the Standard in
his Custody, and to burn such a are otherwise. He has a Court, wherein h^^ may
keep and hold a Plea.

CHAP. VIII.
Of Mayors and Aldermen, Bailiffs, Stewards, and their respective Courts; with
an Account of the Constables.

Every City of England, says Dr. Chamberlain, is, by their Charters or
Privileges granted by several Kings, a little Commonwealth apart; governed,
not (as the ^^ties of France and Spain) by a Nobleman (...) Gentleman placed
there by the King, but wholly by themselves. For in Cities the Citizens choose
themselves for their Governor Mayor, commonly out of 12 Aldermen. And, ^n some
other Corporations, a Bailiff is chosen ^f a certain Number of Burgesses.

The Mayor is the Kings Lieutenant, and ^uring his Mayoralty (which is but for
one ^ear) is in a manner a Judge to determine ^atters, and to mitigate the
Rigor of the ^^w. Therefore he keeps a Court, with his ^ethren the Aldermen.
With these, and the ^ommon Council, he can make Bylaws, for ^e better
Government of the City, provided ^^ey be not repugnant to the known Laws of ^^e
Realm. So that the Mayor, Aldermen, ^^d Common Council assembled, are in a
manner, an Image of the King, Lords, and Commons convened in Parliament.

If the Citizens be Taxed, it is by themselves or their Representatives; every
Trade having some of their own Members always of the Council, to see that
nothing be enacted to their Prejudice.

But the Sheriffs have also a good share in the Government of Cities; as being
the proper Judges of Civil Causes within the same, and the principal Officers
appointed to see all Executions done, whether Penal or Capital.

As every County of England is divided into Hundreds, so the King's Subjects
formerly had Justice ministered to them by Officers of Hundreds, called
Bailiffs, who might hold Plea of Appeal and Approvers. But, in the Reign of
Edward III, these Hundred Courts (certain Franchises excepted,) were dissolved
into the County-Courts. Yet there are still diverse considerable Towns, the
chief Magistrates whereof have retained the name of Bailiff, as Ipswich,
Yarmouth, Colchester, etc. Where the Bayliff's Authority is the same with the
Mayor's in other Places, and they keep Courts accordingly.

The Truth is, they differ in nothing but the Name. For the Mayor of London,
before the Reign of Richard the First, was called the Bailiff of London. So
King John, following the Example of Richard, made the Bailiff of Kings Lynn a
Mayor, in the year 1204; and Henry V. made the Bailiff of Norwich a Mayor,
Anno^^ 1419.

But there are others to whom the name of Bailiff is still appropriate; as the
Bailiff of Dover Castle; that is, the Governor thereof. There be likewise
Bailiffs of Manors, or Husbandry; such as have the Oversight of Under-Servants
to private Men of great Substance, that set every Man to his Labor and Task,
gather the Profits to their Lord and Master, and give him an Account thereof.

The vilest sort of Bailiffs to this day are those Officers that serve Writs,
and Arrest People by virtue thereof. And these are of two Sorts, Bailiffs
Errants, and Bailiffs of Franchises. The first are such as the Sheriff makes
and appoints to go any where in the County to serve Writs, to summon the
County, Sessions, Assizes, and such like. Bailiffs of Franchises be those that
are appointed by every Lord of a Manor, to do such Offices within his Liberty
as the Bailiff Errant does at large in the County.

By Stewards, I mean here such as are Employed by some Lords of Manors to hold
their Courts, called Court Leet, or View of Frankpledge; the word Leet
signifying properly a Law-Day.

This is a Court of Record, not incident to every Manor; but to those only
which by special Grant, or long Prescription, hold the same. For it is likely
Kings did not entrust any with this Power, but such as they had great Kindness
for and Confidence in. To this Court those that are within the Homage, and
sometimes those out of it, are called to Swear Fidelity to the Prince. Here
also Inquiry is made of Privy Conspiracies, Frays, Bloodshed, and Murders. To
which was added the Oversight of Measures. And what Offenses are found,
especially great ones, ought to be Certified to the Justices of Assize, by a
Statute made in the Reign of Edward III. For in whose Manor soever this Court
be Kept, it is accounted the King's Court, because the Authority thereof
originally belongs to the Crown.

In short, this Court (first derived from the Sheriffs Turn) is ordinarily Kept
but twice a Year, and that at certain times.

But there is another Court incident to every Manor, called Court Baron,
because in ancient times every Lord of a Manor was styled Baron.

To this Court are all the Tenants Summoned that belong to the Manor; where
part of the Tenants being Sworn, make a Jury, which is not called the Inquest,
but the Homage. Here the Steward sits as Judge, and directs the Jury to enquire
of such Things as are proper for this Court. And these principally Inquire of
Copyholders and Freeholders that be dead since the last Court, and bring in
their Heirs and next Successors. They likewise Inquire of any Incroachment or
Intrusion of Tenants against the Lord, or among themselves. They also make
Orders and Laws amongst themselves, with a Penalty annexed for Transgressors
payable to the Lord of the Manor.

In short, these Courts are of great Use for Men that are willing to be ordered
by their Neighbors, and who prefer their Quiet and Advantage in Husbandry to
the Trouble and Charges of Lawsuits. Otherwise either Party may procure a Writ
out of a higher Court, to remove the Plea to Westminster.

Courts-Baron may be held every three Weeks, or at any longer time, according
to the Lords pleasure.

I conclude with Constables, called in some Places Headboroughs, and in others
Tithing-men, whose Office is only Ministerial. These Men, says Sir Thomas
Smith, were formerly called Custodes Pacis, or Guardians of the Peace, and were
in much greater esteem than they be now, whose Power and Authority he supposes
to have been equal with that of the present Justices of Peace.

Lambert looks upon this Office as a Stream of that great Dignity lodged in the
Lord High Constable of England. Out of this high Magistracy, says he, were
drawn those lower Constables, which we call Constables of Hundreds and
Franchises. First ordained by the Statute of Winchester, 13 Ed. I. which
appoints for the Conservation of the Peace, and view of Armor, two Constables
in every Hundred and Franchise, called in Latin Constabularii Capitales, in
English, High Constables. And, by reason of the Increase both of People and
Offenses, others were made in process of time, called Petty Constables, which
are of like Nature, but of inferior Authority to the other.

The Office of a Constable is properly to apprehend such as break the Peace,
and common Malefactors, and even Persons suspected of any Crime, upon a Charge
given them, or a Warrant for it from a Justice. For a Badge of his Authority,
he carries a long Staff painted, with the King's Arms; and, for a Surprise,
sometimes he uses a short Staff, which he hides till he thinks it convenient to
produce it. The Party apprehended he keeps in his Custody, till he can bring
him before a Justice of Peace; who, upon a strict Examination of the Fact, and
hearing of the Evidence, commits the Party to Prison, if he sees cause, in
order to his Trial. Upon which the Constable conducts him to Prison, and there
delivers him to the Goalers Custody, with the Committimus directed by the
Justice of Peace to the Jayler. And the Party mustly in Prison, till the
Justices of Peace do meet either at their Quarter Sessions, or at their
Jail-delivery, when the Prisoners are by Law either condemned, or acquit^ed.

When he is upon Duty, and about to apprehend one, he may call his Neighbors
to aid; and whoever declines to give him assistance, is liable by Law to
Punishment.

In case of Theft, Robbery, or Murder, in a Country Town or Village, and the
Malefactor be upon flight, the Constable having notice of it, is to raise the
Parish in pursuit of him. And this is called Hue and Cry. If the Malefactor be
not found in the Parish, the Constable and his Assistants are to go to the
next, to get the Hue and Cry raised there by the Constable of it. In this
manner the Hue and Cry is carried from Parish to Parish, till the Criminal be
found. And that Parish which does not do its Duty, but gives way by its
Negligence for the Malefactors Escape, is not only to pay a Fine to the King,
but must repay to the Party robbed his Damages.

When the Malefactor is taken, he is presently carried by the Constable, or any
other by whom he was apprehended, to a Justice of Peace. Who examines the
Malefactor, writes the Examination, and (if he do confess) his Confession. Then
he binds the Party robbed, or him that sueth, together with the Constable, and
so many as can give Evidence against the Malefactor, to appear at the next
Sessions of Jail-delivery, there to give their Evidence for the King. He binds
them in a Recognizance of 10. 20. 30. 40. or 100. l. more or less, according to
his Discretion and the quality of the Crime. Which, being certified under his
hand, fails not to be levied upon Recognizance, if they fail of being there.

Thus the Constables, which formerly had much the same Authority as our modern
Justices of Peace, are now subservient to them upon all Occasions, either to
bring the Criminals before them, or to carry them by their Command to the
common Prison. And accordingly this Office does commonly fall into the hands of
Tradesmen and Artificers, and Men of small experience and ability; who hold it
for a Year, there being commonly two of them to each Parish, chosen by the
Vestry. But the hardest part of their Office in London, especially is their
Watching a Nights, and walking the Rounds in their several Parishes. But then
they have the chief Command of the Watch; and because seldom a greater Power
appears abroad at that time, therefore a Constable came to be called the King
of the Night.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Assizes.

BEsides the public Justice administered at four times of the Year in
Westminster, both for Civil and Criminal Causes, the Twelve Judges take twice a
Year a Progress in the Country, and exercise their Judicial Power in the
several Counties the King is pleased to appoint them for. The Times of the Year
fixed for it are presently after the end of Hilary-Term, and after the end of
Trinity Term; that being called the Lent, and this the Summer Assizes. In
relation to which, England is divided into Six Parts, called Circuits. Viz. 1.
Home-Circuit, Comprehending Essex, Hartford, Sussex, Surrey, Kent. 2. Norfolk
Circuit, Comprehending Bucks, Bedford, Huntington, Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffolk.
3. Midland Circuit, Comprehending Warwick, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham,
Lincoln, Rutland, Northampton. 4. Oxford Circuit, Comprehending Berks, Oxon,
Gloucester, Monmouth, Hereford, Salop, Stafford, Worcester. 5. Western Circuit,
Comprehending Southampton, Wilts, Dorset, Somerset, Cornwall, Devon. 6. Northern
Circuit, Comprehending York, Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Lancaster.


Besides the two Circuits for Wales, viz. North and South Wales, for each of
which two Sergeants at Law are appointed.

Now these Courts are called Assizes, and the Judges thereof Justices of
Assize, from their Commission of Assize; by virtue whereof they are to do Right
upon Writs called Assizes, and brought before them by such as are (or pretend
to be) wrongfully thrust out of their Lands. The Writs so called, 1. Because
they settle the Possession, and so an outward Right in him that obtains by
them. 2. Because they were originally executed at a certain Time and Place
formerly appointed. 3. For that they are tried commonly by special Courts
appointed for that purpose.

But, besides this Commission, there are four others, by which these Itinerant
Judges administer Justice in the Country. As, the Commission to take
Nisi-prius, directed to none but the Judges themselves, and their Clerks of
Assizes, by which they are called Justices of Nisi prius. Which is a common
Adjournment of a Cause in the Common Pleas, to put it off to such a Day, Nisi
prius Justiciarii venerint ad eas Parts ad capiendas Assisas, from which Words
Nisi prius the Writ came to be called a Writ of Nisi prius, the Justices,
Justices of Nisi prius, as well as Justices of Assize. Yet there is this
Difference, that as Justices of Assize, they have Power to give Judgment in a
Cause, whereas Justices of Nisi prius take only the Verdict. Besides that those
in a strict sense, meddle only with the possessory Writs called Assize; but
these do deal in Causes both real and personal.

Another is a Commission of Peace, in every County of the Circuit.

But the largest Commission of all is That of Oyer and Terminer, directed to
the Judges, and many others of the best account in their Circuits; but in this
Commission, the Judges of Assize are of the Quorum, so as without them there
can be no Proceedings. This Commission gives them Power to judge of Treasons,
Murders, and all manner of Felonies and Misdemeanors.

Lastly, they have a Commission of Goal Delivery, directed only to themselves,
and the Clerk of the Assize associate. By which Commission they are to deal
with every Prisoner in Goal, for what Offense soever he be there.

Now these Courts are usually held at the principal Town of every County, with
great pomp, splendor, and feasting, two Judges being appointed for every
Circuit. Then the Sheriff of the County is bound to attend in person, with his
Underofficers, the Clerks, Stewards of Courts, Bailiffs of Hundreds,
Constables, Jaylors, Sergeants or Beadles, and a gallant Train of Servants in
rich Liveries, all riding on Horseback at the Reception of the Judges; whom
they wait on and guard, so long as they continue in the County. If the Sheriff
cannot come himself, he must depute one to fill up his Place; who is to be
allowed by the Judges. The Justices of Peace are also to wait on the Judges.
And, if either the Sheriff, or they fail in this part of their Duty, without
lawful Impediment, the Judges may set a Fine upon him or them, at their
pleasure and discretions.

The Dispatch of these Itinerant Judges in the Administration of Justice in
their several Circuits is worthy our Observation. For within each County all
Controversies grown to Issue in the Courts at London, are commonly determined
here in two or three Days. Which is done, not as in foreign Countries, by the
sole Arbitrament of the Judges, but by a Jury of Twelve Men in each County,
chosen by the Sheriff thereof, and only directed in point of Law by the Judges.
For every Trial by Assize (be the Action civil or criminal, public or private,
personal or real) is referred for the Fact to a Jury, as it is in most Courts
of the Common Law; and, as they find it, so passes the Judgment.

The Way of Trying Criminals in England being something singular and different
from other Nations, it will not be improper (after that excellent and most
ingenious Author, Sir Thomas Smith) to show the Manner of it, were it but for
the satisfaction of Foreiners.

How Criminals are taken into Custody in order to their Trial, and how the same
are Indicted at the Quarter Sessions, I have already showed. The Indictment is
no definitive Sentence, but only Praejudicium, or the Opinion the Country has
of the Malefactors Case. Therefore Men are often Indicted in their absence. But
no Man once Indicted can be delivered without an Arraignment; for as a Jury of
Twelve Men have given a Prejudice against him, so Twelve again must acquit or
condemn him.

At the Assizes the Judges sit either in the Townhouse, or in an open Place,
where a Tribunal is set up for Judgment The Judges sit in the middle, the
principal Justices of Peace on each side of them according to their Degree, and
the rest on a lower Bench before the Judges Seat. Something lower a Table is
set before them, at which the Custos Rotulorum or Keeper of Writs, the
Undersheriff, the Escheater, and the Clerks do sit. Near the Table there is a
Bar for the Jury to come in, when they are called; and behind that space
another Bar for the Prisoners to stand at, who are brought thither in Chains.

Then the Crier cries, and commands Silence. One of the Judges makes a short
Speech, wherein he declares (amongst other Things) the cause of their coming.
His Speech is no sooner ended, but the Prisoners are called in by Name, and
every one must answer to his Name. Then the Keeper of the Writs produces the
Inditements, and the Judges name one, or two, or three of the Prisoners
Indicted, to proceed upon their Trial.

The Clerk bids one of them come to the Bar, and hold up his hand. Then he
charges him with his Crime, to which he bids him answer Guilty, or Not Guilty.

If the Prisoner stands mute, and will not answer, after he has been once or
twice so Interrogated (which happens very seldom,) he is Judged Mute, or Dumb
by Contumacy; the Punishment whereof is to be Pressed to Death, of which more
afterward.

If the Prisoner cries Guilty, (which is but seldom too) his Trial is over, and
all the Business is to pronounce Sentence upon him, according to Law.

But the common Answer is Not Guilty, though the Party be never so apparently
Guilty, and his Answer be perhaps contrary to his Confession of the Fact before
the Justice of Peace by whom he was examined and committed. The Reason is,
because he flatters himself, that he may chance to come off for want of right
Evidence. For the Law of England is so tender of Men's Lives, that unless the
Evidences (which are upon their Oaths) be positive and clear against any
Prisoner, he may come off.

Upon the Prisoner's pleading Not Guilty, the Clerk asks him, whether he will
be Tried by God and the Country. If he answer Yes, the Clerk tells him, he has
been Indicted of such a Crime, etc. That he has pleaded Not Guilty to it, and
that being asked how he would be Tried, he has answered by God and the Country.
Then he tells him of the Jury present, that represent the Country; and, if he
has something to object against any of them, he bids him take a view of them,
and speak, for that he stands upon Life and Death.

Upon this the Jury is Sworn, consisting of 12 Men at least. And, if the
Prisoner be a^ Stranger, it is a Party Jury, consisting half o^ Englishmen, and
half of Foreiners. In case the Prisoner has no Exception to make against any of
them, by that time Twelve are Sworn, these stand to give the Verdict. Whereupon
the Crier says aloud, If any one can give Evidence, or can say any thing
against the Prisoner, let him come now, for he stands upon his Deliverance. If
none come in, the Judge does ask who sent him to Prison. And, if the Justice of
Peace be present who did it, he delivers up the Examination he took of him,
subscribed by those whom he has bound to give Evidence; who, for not appearing,
must pay their Recognizance. In the mean time the Jury acquit the Prisoner, tho
he has confessed the Crime to the Justice of Peace.

But, if they come in that are bound to give Evidence, first the Justices
Examination is read; and then the Party robbed (being present) is sworn, next
to him the Constable and such as were with him at the taking of the Prisoner,
and at last as many more as are there to give Evidence. Who are all set in a
convenient place to see the Judges and Justices, the Jury, and the Prisoner, so
as to hear them, and to be heard of them all.

The Judge, after they be sworn, asks first the Party robbed, if he know the
Prisoner, and bids him look upon him. The Party robbed says Yes, and upon that
relates the Robbery, with all its Circumstances. But the Prisoner standing
still upon the Negative, those who were at the Taking of him, or any other that
can Evidence against him are heard one after another.

The Prisoner on the other side is free to make what Defense he can. And, tho
the ^^ing be Party against him as one that has ^^oke his Peace, yet the Judges
do freely hear what he can say for himself, provided he keep within bounds. But
he is allowed no Council, which in Civil and Pecuniary Matters is never denied;
be it for Land, Rent, Right, ^or Possession, tho he plead against the King.

When the Judge has heard them all, he ^sks them if they can say any more. Upon
their silence he directs the Jury, and bids them dischange their Consciences.
If the Case be plain, they consult together without going from the Bar; and, if
they do all agree, the Foreman of the Jury, in the Name of himself and the
rest, pronounces the Prisoner Guilty. If the Case requires a Debate, they
withdraw into a Room, only with a Copy of the Indictment; ^and there they are
to remain by themselves, till they be all agreed on the Verdict, without bread,
drink, meat, or fire. To which purpose there is a Bailiff appointed to watch
them. If but one of the Jury stands it out against the rest, he must either
bring them over to him, or they must bring him over to them, before they can
stir out of the Room, or have the least Refreshment in it. So that it is in the
power of one to make all the rest ^n a manner Prisoners; and, if he be
obstitate, to put them to Inconveniences for want ^f Necessaries, till he
himself can bear with them no longer.

When the Jury have agreed upon the Ver^ict, they give notice of it to the
Bailiff, and ^^ay to be heard. Then the Prisoner being sent for again to the
Bar, each one of the Jury is called in by his Name, and he answer to it. The
Clerk asks, if they be agreed and who shall speak for them. Which being
answered, the Prisoner is bidden to hold up his hand, to whom the Clerk speaks
in these Words; Thou art Indicted by the Name of A of such a Place, etc. and
being Arraigned Tho^ pleadest thereto Not Guilty; being Asked how Thou would
be Tried, Thou said By God and the Country; These honest Men were given t^
thee by God and thy Prince for thy Country Hearken what they say. Then he
asks of the Jury, What say you? Is he Guilty, or No^ Guilty? The Foreman
makes answer (...) one word, Guilty, or in two, Not Guilty. The first is Death
to the Prisoner, and the last Acquits him; for neither the Judges, nor the
Justice can alter or reverse this Judgment.

Then the Clerk asks, what Lands or Chattels the Prisoner had at the time of
the Felony committed. Which is commonly answered by the Jury with an Ignoramus.
But the Sheriff and the Escheator are diligent enough to find it out, both for
the Princes and their own Advantage.

Upon this the Judge does ask the Prisone^ Convicted what he can say for
himself, why Sentence should not pass upon him. If he ca^ read never so little,
he demands the Benefit of the Clergy, an ancient Liberty of the Church, which
has been confirmed by diverse Parliaments. By virtue whereof one in Orders
arraigned of Felony by a Secular Judge, might pray his Clergy, which was as
much as if he prayed to be delivered to his Ordinary, to purge himself of the
Offense objected. But the ancient Course of the Law in this point of Clergy is
much altered, so that Laymen have been made capable of this Benefit in many
Cases; As in Theft of Oxen, Sheep, Money, and other Things, not forcibly taken
to the terror of the Owner. So favorable is our Law, that for the first Fault
the Felon shall be admitted to his Clergy. In order to which the Bishop sends a
Clergyman, with a Commission under his Seal, to be Judge in that matter at
every Jail-delivery. If the Prisoner demands to be admitted to his Book, the
Judge commonly gives him a Psalter, and turns to what place he pleases. The
Prisoner reads as well as he can, and it happens most times but sadly. Then the
Judge asks of the Bishops Commissary, Legit ut Clericus? To which the
Commissary must answer Legit, or Non legit; for these be the formal Words, and
our Men of Law are the most precise in their Forms. If he say Legit, the Judge
proceeds no further to Sentence of Death. But, if he say Non legit, the
Sentence follows either that Day or the next, in these Words, Thou A. have been
Indicted of such a Felony, and therefore Arraigned; Thou have pleaded Not
Guilty, and put thy self upon God and thy Country; They have found thee Guilty,
and Thou have nothing to say for thy self; The Law is, that Thou halt return to
the Place from whence thou came, and from thence Thou shall go to the Place
of Execution, where Thou shall Hang by the Neck ^ill Thou be dead. Whereupon he
charges the ^heriff with the Execution. But he that ^^aimeth his Clergy in
Cases where it is ad^itted is in the presence of the Judges burnt (...) the
brawn of his Hand with a hot Iron, marked with the Letter T. for a Thief, or M.
for Manslayer. Then he is delivered to the Bishops Officer, to be kept in the
Bishops Prison; from whence, after a certain time, he is delivered by a Jury of
Clerks. But, if he be taken and found Guilty again, and his Mark discovered,
then it is his Lot to be hanged.

But he whom the Jury pronounces Not Guilty is Acquitted forthwith and
Discharged, paying the Jailer his Fees.

And, as to those Prisoners who stand not Indicted, but were only sent to Prison
upon Suspicion, the Way is to Proclaim 'em first in this manner; A. B. Prisoner
stands here at the Bar; If any Man can say any thing against him, let him now
speak, for the Prisoner stands at his Deliverance. If upon this no Evidence
appears against him, he is set free, paying the Jailer his Fees. Which Way of
Deliverance is called Deliverance by Proclamation.

CHAP. X.
Of the Court Martial, and Court of Admiralty.

THE Court Martial, otherwise called Court of Chivalry, is the Fountain of
Martial Law, and is only held in Time of War, for Martial Discipline.

The proper Judges of this Court are the Lord High Constable, and the Earl
Marshal of England; which last is also to see Execution ^tone.

The Court of Admiralty is about Maritime Concerns, and the Judge thereof is
commonly (...) Dr. of the Civil Law. For, the Sea being out of the reach of the
Common Law, the Proceeding of this Court, in all Civil Matters, is according to
the Civil Law.

And, whereas the Sea by its Flux and Re^ux advances and runs-back twice a Day,
which makes the Bounds of the Sea and Land ^ovable every Day; It is agreed
upon, that (...) far as the Low Water Mark is observed, is within the Counties
Jurisdiction, and Causes ^ence arising are Determinable by the Common Law. But,
upon a full Tide, the Admiral has ^urisdiction (as long as the Sea-flows) over
^ll Matters done between the Low Water Mark and the Land. So that here is, as
Dr. Chamberlain says, Divisum Imperium between the Common Law and the Court of
Admiralty.

Besides the Civil Law which this Court proceeds by, great Use is made here of
the Maritime Laws of Rhodes and Oleron; two Islands, the former whereof is in
the Mediterranean not far from the Continent of Asia, the other in the Ocean
near the Mouth of the Garonne in the Bay of Aquitain.

The Rhodian Laws were compiled by the Inhabitants of Rhodes, a People
anciently very powerful at Sea; and whose Maritime Laws were esteemed so just
and equitable, that the very Romans (so skilful in making of good Laws)
referred all Debates and Controversies in Sea-Affairs to the Judgment of the
Rhodian Laws.

Those of Oleron, called le Roll d' Oleron were made by Order of King Richard
I, the^ possessed of Aquitain, and being at Oleron Which proved such excellent
Laws for Sea-Matters, that they came to be almost a^ much respected and made
use of in these Western Parts, as the Rhodian Laws in the Levant. To which King
Edward III, added very excellent Constitutions concerning Maritime Affairs,
still in force. In Imitation whereof several other Seafaring Nations have done
the like, for their respective Sea-Trade.

As to Criminal Matters, especially about Piracy, the Proceeding in this Court
of Admiralty was, according to the Civil Law, till the Reign of Henry VIII.
When two Statute were made for Criminal Matters to be trie^ by Witnesses and a
Jury by the Kings special Commission to the Lord Admiral, where (...) some
Judges of the Realm are ever Commissioners.

The Writs and Decrees of this Court run in ^he Name of the Lord High Admiral,
or Lords commissioners executing that Office; and are ^irected to all
Vice-Admirals, Justices of ^ace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Constables^
^arshals, and other Officers and Ministers as ^ell within Liberties as without.

To this Court belongs a Register, and a Mar^al. The Marshal attends the Court,
and car^es a Silver Oar before the Judge, whereon ^e the Kings Arms, and the
Lord High Ad^irals.

Here the Lord Admiral has his Advocate, ^d Proctor; by whom all other
Advocates and ^^octors are presented, and admitted by the ^^dge. All the Places
and Offices belonging (...) this Court are in the Gift of the Lord ^^igh
Admiral, and now of the Lords Com^issioners.

The Court is held in the Afternoon in the common Hall at Drs. Commons. But the
Ad^iralty-Session, for the Trial of Malefators and Crimes committed at Sea, is
still ^eld at the ancient Place, viz. S. Margaret's ^ll in Southwark.

CAHP. XI.
Of the Court of Marshalsea, the Courts of Conscience, the Court of Requests
disused, the Forest-Courts, and Pie-powder Courts.

THE first is the Court (or Seat) of the Knight Marshal of the Kings House,
where he judges of Debts for which the Party has been Arrested within the Kings
Verge, and sent to the Marshalsea. Which i^ a Prison in Southwark, where this
Court i^ kept.

King Charles I. erected a Court by Letters Parents under the Great Seal, by
the Name o^ Curia Hospitij Domini Regis, etc. which takes Cognizance more at
large of all Causes tha^ the Marshalsea could; of which the Knight Marshal or
his Deputy are Judges.

The Courts of Conscience are inferior Court^ established and settled by
Parliament in many Parts of the Realm, for the Relief of po^^ People whose Debt
does not amount to forty Shillings. So that by any of these Courts the Creditor
may recover his Debt, and the Debtor pay it at an easy rate.

As for the Court of Requests, 'twas a Court of Equity, much of the same nature
with the Chancery, but inferior to it. Called Court ^f Requests, as being
principally Instituted for the help of such Petitioners as in conscionable
cases dealt by Supplication with the King. This Court followed the King, and
was not ^xt in any Place. But in process of time it ^sumed so great a Power,
and grew so burden^^ and grievous to the Subject, that it was ^ken away
(together with the Star Chamber) (...) Statute made in the Reign of Charles I.

For the Conservation of the Kings Forests, ^^d to prevent all Abuses therein,
there are ^ree Courts established; one called the Ju^ice of Eyres Seat, another
the Swainmote, and ^^e third the Court of Attachment.

The first is (or should be, by ancient Cu^^m) held every third Year by the
Justices Air of the Forest, journeying up and down (...) the purpose aforesaid.

Swainmote is another Court, as incident to a forest as a Pie-powder Court to a
Fair. By ^e Charter of the Forest it is held thrice a ^ear before the
Verderors, as Judges. What things are Inquirable in the same, you may (...) in
Cromp. Jurisd. fol. 150.

The lower Court is called the Attachment, because the Verderors of the Forest
have there^ no other Authority, but to receive the Attchments of Offenders
against Vert and Veni^n taken by the rest of the Officers, and to Inrol ^^em,
that they may be presented and punish^^ at the next Justice-Seat. Now the
Attachments are made three manner of Ways, 1. by ^oods and Chattels, 2. by the
Body, Pledges, ^^d Mainprise, 3. by the Body only. This ^ourt is kept every 40
Days.

Pie-powder Court is a Court held in Fairs, to yield Justice to Buyers and
Sellers, and for Redress of all Disorders committed in them. These Courts are
so called from the French Pie a foot, and poudreux dusty; the Fairs being kept
most usually in Summer, to which the Country people use to come with dusty
feet. A Pie-powder Court is held de hora in horam, every hour; and such is the
Dispatch made here, that Justice ought to be summarily administered within three
ebbing and three flowing of the Sea.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and first of the Convocation.

TO consult of Church Matters, and make Ecclesiastical Laws, now and then the
Convocation meets, and that in time of Parliament. Which Convocation is a
National Synod, or general Assembly of the Clergy, convoked after this manner

Some time before the Parliament sits, the King, by the Advice of his Privy
Council, sends his Writ to the Archbishop of each Province, for Summoning all
Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, etc. assigning them the Time and Place in the
said Writ. Upon which the Archbishop of Canterbury directs his Letters
authentically sealed to the Bishop of London, as his Dean Provincial, wherein
he cites him peremptorily, and wills him to cite in like manner all the
Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, Gathedral and Collegiate Churches and all the
Clergy of his Province, to the Place and Day prefixed in the Writ. But he
directs withal, that one Proctor be sent for every Cathedral or Collegiate
Church, and two for the Body of the Inferior Clergy of each Diocese. All which
the Bishop of London takes accordingly care of, willing the Parties concerned
person (...) to appear, and in the mean time to cer^ify to the Archbishop the
Names of every one so warned in a Schedule annexed to the Letter Certificatory.
Upon which the other Bishops of the Province proceed, the Cathedral and
Collegiate Churches, and the inferior Clergy of each Diocese, make choice of
their Proctors. Which done, and certified to the Bishop of London, he returns
all at the Day. And the same Method is used in the Province of York.

The Chapel of Henry VII. annexed to Westminster Abbey is the usual Place
where the Convocation of the Clergy in the Province of Canterbury meets; Whilst
the Archbishop of York holds at York a Convocation of all his Province in like
manner. Thus, by constant Correspondence, these two Provinces (tho so ^r
distant from each other) do debate and ^onclude of the same Matters.

The Convocation is, like the Parliament, disided into two Houses, the higher
and the ^wer. And all Members have by Statute the ^^me Privileges for
themselves and menial ^ervants as the Members of Parliament have.

The higher House in the Province of Canterbury (which is by much the larger of
the two) consists of 22 Bishops, whereof the Archbishop is President. Who sits
in a Chair at the upper end of a great Table, and the Bishops on each side of
the same Table, all in their Scarlet Robes and Hoods; the Archbishops Hoods
furred with Ermin, and the Bishops with Minever.

The lower House consists of all the Deans, Archdeacons, one Proctor for every
Chapter, and two Proctors for all the Clergy of the Diocese. Which make in all
166 Persons, viz. 22 Deans, 24 Prebendaries, 54 Archdeacons, and 44 Clerks
representing the Diocesan Clergy.

The first Business of each House, upon their Meeting, is to choose each a
Prolocutor, or Speaker. The Prolocutor of the lower House being chosen, he is
presented to the upper House by two of the Members; whereof one makes a Speech,
and the elect Person another, both in Latin. To which the Arch Bishop answers
in Latin, and in the Name of all the Lords approves of the Person.

The Matters debated by both Houses are only such as the King by Commission
do'^ expressly allow, viz. Church and Religion Matters; first proposed in the
Upper, and th^^ communicated to the Lower House. And the major Vote in each
House prevails. Sometimes there have been Royal Aids granted to the King by the
Clergy in Convocation.

Anciently this Assembly might without, (...) now with the Royal Assent, make
Canon touching Religion; binding, not only them selves, but all the Laity,
without Consent o^ Ratification of the Lords and Commons i^ Parliament. Neither
did the Parliament meddle in the making of Canons, or in Doctrinal Matters,
till the Civil Wars in the Reign of Charles I. Only, when thereto required,
they by their Civil Sanctions did confirm the Results and Consultations of the
Clergy; whereby the People might be the more easily induced to obey the
Ordinances of their Spiritual Governors.

To conclude, the Laws and Constitutions whereby the Church of England is
governed are first general Canons made by general Councils, with the Opinion of
the orthodox Fathers, and the grave Decrees of several holy Bishops of Rome,
which have been admitted from time to time by the Kings of England. Then our
own Constitutions made anciently in several Provincial Synods, both by the
Popes Legates Otho and Othobon, and by several Archbishops of Canterbury; all
which are of force in England, so far as they are not repugnant to the Laws and
Customs of England, or the Kings Prerogative. Next to those Constitutions, this
Church is also governed by Canons made in Convocations of latter times, as in
the first Year of the Reign of King James I, and confirmed by his Authority.
Also, by some Statutes of Parliament ^ouching Church Affairs, and by diverse
Imme^orial Customs. But where all these fail, the Civil Law takes place.

CHAP. XIII.
Of the Court of Arches, the Court of Audience, the Prerogative-Court, the
Court of Delegates, the Court of Peculiars, etc.

FROM the Church Legislative, I come to the Executive Power, for which there
have been several Courts provided. Amongst which is the Court of Arches, the
chief and most ancient Consistory that belongs to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, for the debating of Spiritual Causes. So called from the arched
Church and Tower of S. Mary le Bow in Cheapside London, where this Court is
wont to be held. The Judge whereof is called Dean of the Arches, or the
Official of the Court of Arches, because with this Officialty is commonly
joined a peculiar Jurisdiction of 13 Parishes in London, termed a Deanery, being
exempt from the Bishop of Londons Jurisdiction, and belonging to the
Archbishop of Canterbury. All Appeals in Church Matters within the Province of
Canterbury are directed to this Court. In which the Judge sits alone without
Assessors, hearing and determining all Causes without any Jury.

The Advocates allowed to plead in this Court are all to be Doctors of the
Civil Law. Who, upon their Petition to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his
Fiat obtained, are admitted by the Judge of this Court, but must not practice
the first Year.

Both the Judge and the Advocates always wear their Scarlet Robes, with Hoods
lined with Taffety if they be of Oxford, or white Minever Furr if of Cambridge,
and all round black Velvet Caps.

Besides the Advocates, here are also ten Proctors, to manage other Men's
Causes. Who wear Hoods lined with Lambs-Skin, if not Graduates; but if
Graduates, Hoods proper to the Degree.

According to the Statutes of this Court, all Arguments made by Advocates, and
Petitions by the Proctors, are to be made in Latin. All Process of this Court
runs in the Name of the Judge.

To this Court belong two principal Officers that attend it. Viz. an Actuary,
who sets down the Judges Decrees, registers the Court Acts, and sends them in
Books to the Registry.

Then a Register, whose Office is by himself, ^or Deputy, to receive all Libels
or Bills, Allegations, and Exhibits of Witnesses, to file all Sentences, and
keep the Records of the Court.

Next to which is the Beadle, an inferior Officer, who carries a Mace before
the Judge, and calls the Persons that are cited to appear.

All Places and Offices belonging to this Court are in the Archbishops Gift.

The Audience Court is a Court of equal Authority with the Arches, tho
inferior both in Antiquity and Dignity. The Original of this Court was thus.
The Archbishop of Canterbury heard many Causes extrajudicially at home in his
own Palace; but, before he would finally determine any thing, he did usually
commit them to be discussed by certain Men learned in the Civil and Canon Laws,
who thereupon were called his Auditors, till at last those Causes were
committed to One, thence named Causarum Negotiorumque Audientiae Cantuariensis
Auditor seu Officialis. And with this Office was joined heretofore the
Archbishops Chancery, which properly meddles not with any point of contentious
Jurisdiction, or deciding of Causes between Party and Party, but only of
Office; as the Granting the Custody of the Spiritualities during the Vacation
of Bishoprics, Institution to Benefices, Dispensing with Banes of Matrimony,
etc. But this is now distinguished from the Audience.

The Prerogative Court is the Court wherein all Wills are proved, and all
Administrations taken, that belong to the Arch Bishop by his Prerogative; that
is, where the Deceased had Goods of any considerable value out of the Diocese
wherein he died. And that Value is usually 5 l. except it be otherwise by
Composition between the Archbishop and the Bishop, as in the Diocese of
London, where it is 10 l. If any Contention arise between Two or more touching
any such Will or Administration, the Cause is properly debated and decided in
this Court. The Judge whereof is termed Judex Curiae Praerogativae
Cantuariensis, the Judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury.

Who is attended in the Court by a Register, or his Deputy, whose Office is to
set down the Decrees and Acts of the Court, to Keep the Records, all Original
Wills and Testaments of Parties deceased that have left Bona Not abilia, etc.
His Office is commonly called the Prerogative Office, now Kept in the Deans
Court near St. Paul's Churchyard; where, for a moderate Fee, one may have a
Copy of any such Testament. And Under the Register are Six Clerks, severally
appointed for such and such Counties.

This Court, formerly held in the Consistory of St. Paul's, is now Kept in the
Common Hall at Drs. Commons, next Day after the Arches, in the Afternoon.

All Places belonging to this Court are in his Grace's Gift.

The Archbishop of York has also the like Court, which is termed his Exchequer,
but far inferior to this in Power and Profit. He has also an Audience Court.

For Civil Affairs that concern the Church, the highest Court is the Court of
Delegates. A Court which consists of Commissioners delegated or appointed by
the King's Commission, to sit upon an Appeal to Him in the Court of Chancery,
and is granted in three Cases. First, when a Sentence is given in any
Ecclesiastical Cause by the Archbishop, or his Official. Secondly, when any
Sentence is given in any Ecclesiastical Cause in Places exempt. Thirdly, when
Sentence is given in the Admiralty in Suits Civil and Marine, by order of the
Civil Law.

The Judges are appointed by the Lord Chancellor, under the Great Seal of
England, pro illa vice; and upon every Cause or Business there is a new
Commission, and new Judges, according to the nature of the Cause. As sometimes
Bishops, Common Law Judges, Noblemen, Knights, and Civilians; sometimes
Bishops, and Civilians; at other times Common Law Judges, and Civilians; and
sometimes Civilians only.

This Court is Kept in the same Place as the former, the next Day after the
Prerogative-Court in the Afternoon. Here the Citations and Decrees run in the
King's Name, and to this Court belongs a standing Register.

From this Court lies no Appeal in common Course. But the King may (and
sometimes does) grant a Commission of Review, under the Great Seal.

The Court of Peculiars is about certain Parishes that have Jurisdiction within
themselves for Probate of Wills, etc. being exempt from the Ordinary, and the
Bishops Courts. It Is an ancient Privilege of the Sea of Canterbury, that
wheresoever any Manors or Advowsons do belong to it, they forthwith become
exempt from the Ordinary, and are reputed Peculiars. And there are reckoned in
his Province no less than 57 such Peculiars. So the King's Chapel is a Royal
Peculiar, exempt from all Spiritual Jurisdiction, and reserved to the
Visitation and immediate Government of the King himself, who is supreme
Ordinary.

Besides these Courts serving for the whole Province, every Bishop has his
Court held in the Cathedral of his Diocese. Over which he has a Chancellor,
anciently termed the Church-Lawyer, who being skilled in the Civil and Canon
Law, sits there as Judge. But, if his Diocese be large, he has in some more
remote Place a Commissary, whose Authority is only in some certain Places of
the Diocese, and certain Causes limited to him by the Bishop in his Commission.
These are called Consistory Courts.

Every Archdeacon besides has his Court and Jurisdiction, where smaller
Differences arising within his Limits are pleaded. The Dean and Chapter of
every Cathedral or Collegiate Church have also a Court, wherein they take
Cognizance of Causes happening in Places belonging to the Cathedral.

The proper Matters belonging to Ecclesiastical Courts are Ordinations,
Institution of Clerks to Benefices, Celebration of Divine Service, Tithes,
Oblations, Obventions, Mortuaries, Dilapidations, Reparation of Churches.
Rights of Matrimony, Divorces, general Bastardy, Probate of Wills,
Administrations, Pensions, Procurations, Commutation of Penance, etc. the
Cognizance whereof does not belong to the Common Law. Also Apostasy from
Christianity, Simony, Heresy, Schisms, Blasphemy, Fornication, Incests,
Adulteries.

The Manner of Trials here is different from those at Common Law, as thus.
First goes forth a Citation, then a Bill and Answer, after that they proceed to
Proofs, Witnesses, and Presumption, the Matter being argued pro and con, and
the Canon and Civil Laws quoted. Upon which the definitive Sentence of the
Judge passes without any Jury, and then Execution. follows.

And for Criminal Causes, they are here tried by Accusation, as when one takes
upon him to prove the Crime. Or by Denunciation, when the Churchwardens
present, and are not bound to prove, because it is presumed they do it without
malice, and that the Crime is notorious.

CHAP. XIV.
Of the Courts of London; and first of the Mayor's Court, the Court of
Aldermen, the Common Council Court, the Hustings, the Court of Jail-delivery,
the Two Sheriffs, and the Chamberlain's Courts.

THE City of London is, amongst other Things, so remarkable for her
transcendent Privileges in Keeping her own Courts of Justice, that it will not
be improper to describe 'em here.

I begin with the Lord Mayor's Court, which is a Court of Record, held in the
Chamber of Guildhall. The Recorder of the City is Judge of this Court; but the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen may sit as Judges with him, if they please. In this
Court all manner of Actions may be entered and tried by a Jury, as in other
Courts, for any Debt, Trespass, or other Matter whatsoever, arising within the
Liberties of London, and to any value. There are only four Attorneys belonging
to it; and six Sergeants at Mace, one of them constantly attending at the Lord
Mayor's House, and the rest at the Attorneys Offices.

The Charge of entering an Action in this Court is but 4 d. besides the King's
Duty. It may be brought to a Trial for 30 s. Charge, and in 14 Days time; the
Day for Trials being every Tuesday. An Action entered in this Court will remain
in force for ever; although no Proceedings; be had thereupon. Whereas an Action
entered at either of the Compters dies, and may be crossed after 16 Weeks.

The Advantages of making Attachments in this Court are considerable, as you
may see in the Book called Lex Londinensis, or the City Law.

The Court of Aldermen is a Court of Record, held in the Inner Chamber of
Guildhall every Tuesday and Thursday, except Holy Days, and in the Time of
Sessions of Jail-delivery. This Court does constantly appoint the Assize of
Bread, determines all Matters touching Lights, Watercourse, and Party-Walls,
and here must be sealed all Bonds and Leases that pass under the City-Seal.

Several Places are in the Gift of the Lord Mayor and this Court. Viz. The
Recorder, Sword Bearer, Four City Counsel, a City Remembrancer, the Common
Hunt. Water-Bayliff, Cities Solicitor, Comptroller of the Chamber, two
Secondaries, Four Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court, Clerk of the Chamber,
Hall-Keeper, Three Sergeant Carvers, Three Sergeants of the Chamber, Sergeant
of the Channel, Yeomen of the Chamber, Four Yeomen of the Waterside, Yeoman of
the Channel, Under Water-Bayliff, Meal-Weighers, Clerk of the Cities Works, Six
Young Men, Two Clerks of the Papers, Eight Attorneys in the Sheriffs Court,
Eight Clerk-sitters, Two Protonotaries, Clerk of the Bridge-house, Clerk of the
Court of Requests, Beadle of the Court of Requests, Thirty Six Sergeants at
Mace, Thirty Six Yeomen, the Gager, Sealers and Searchers of Leather, Keeper of
the Green-Yard, Two Keepers of the Compters, Keeper of Newgate, Keeper of
Ludgate, Measurer, Steward of Southwark, Bailiff of Southwark, and Bailiff of
the Hundred of Ossulston.

There are other Places in the gift of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs; as
the City-Carpenter, and other Artificers. But the Rent-Gatherer has been put in
by Mr. Chamberlain.

If any Officer (says Lex Londinensis) shall misbehave himself in his Office,
upon Complaint made thereof to this Court, and Proof of the Fact, such Offender
may be, and is usually suspended from the Profits of his Place, during the
pleasure of this Court.

The Rulers of the Company of Watermen are annually elected and appointed by
this Court.

The Court of Common Council consists of two Orders, as the Parliament of
England; viz. the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, which represent the House of Lords,
and the Common Council Men which represent the House of Commons, whose Number
amounts to 231, belonging to their respective Wards, whereof some have more,
some less. This Court is held in the Chamber of Guildhall, at such Times as the
Lord Mayor appoints and directs, being in his Lordships power to call and
dismiss this Court at his pleasure.

Several Committees are annually appointed and elected by this Court for the
better and more speedy Dispatch of the City-Affairs, who make Report to this
Court of their Proceedings, as Occasion requires. Viz. a Committee of 6
Aldermen and 12 Commoners, for letting and demising the Cities Lands and
Tenements; who usually meet every Wednesday in the Afternoon at Guildhall for
that purpose. A Committee of 4 Aldermen, and 8 Commoners, to let and dispose of
the Lands and Tenements given by Sir Tho. Gresham, who usually meet at Mercer's
Hall, at such Times as the Lord Mayor for the time being directs and appoints;
and the Lord Mayor himself is commonly chosen one of this Committee.

This Court does also annually elect Commissioners for the Sewers, and
Pavements. And by this Court are annually elected a Governor,
Deputy Governor, and Assistants, for the Management of the Cities Lands in
Ulster in Ireland.

A Stranger born may be made free of this City by Order of this Court, and not
otherwise. The Places of Common Sergeant, Town Clerk, and Common Crier, are in
the Gift of this Court. The Judges of the Sheriffs Court have sometimes been
elected by this Court, and sometimes by the Court of Aldermen.

The Hustings is a very ancient Court of Record, always held in Guildhall, and
commonly every Tuesday, before the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of London for the
time being. When any Matter is to be argued or tried in this Court, Mr.
Recorder sits as Judge with the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and gives Rules and
Judgment therein. And, though the Original Writ be directed to the Mayor and
Sheriffs jointly, yet these by Commandment of the Lord Mayor, are Ministers to
execute all Process out of this Court.

In this Court Deeds may be Enrolled, Recoveries passed, Wills proved; and
Replevins, Writs of Error, Right, Patent, Waste, Partition, and Dower may be
determined for any Matters within the City of London, and the Liberties thereof.

The Attorneys of the Lord Mayor's Court are Attorneys also in this Court; and
the second Attorney is always Clerk of the Inrollments, and Inrolls all Deeds
brought for that purpose. Now a Deed Enrolled in the Hustings is counted as
good as a Fine at Common Law; for that it bars the Wife from claiming her Dower.

In this Court also the Burgesses to serve for the City in Parliament are
elected by the Livery-men of the respective Companies, which is done after this
manner, in the presence of the Court. First, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are
put up (according to ancient Custom) for Candidates, and after them are usually
nominated four Commoners. And out of them all, the four that have the plurality
of Voices are declared by the Sheriffs to be duly chosen. But, if there be any
Contest about the Election, it is usually decided by a Poll.

The Court of Goal Delivery is usually held 8 times a Year at the Old Bailey,
both for the City of London and County of Middlesex, for the Trial of
Criminals. The Lord Mayor is the chief Judge of this Court, assisted by some of
the Judges, besides the Recorder, and the two Sheriffs. He has the Power of
Reprieving condemned Persons.

The Two Sheriffs Courts are held in Guildhall, the one by one Sheriff, every
Wednesday and Friday, for Actions entered at the Woodstreet Compter, the other
by the other Sheriff, every Thursday and Saturday, for Actions entered at the
Poultry Compter.

To these Courts belong 8 Attorneys, whose Business here is not to keep any
Record, but only to assist their Clients, and take their Fees due to them in
every Cause. Two Secondaries, who allow and return all Writs brought to remove
Causes out of these Courts. Two Clerks of the Papers, whose business is to draw
the Subpoenas for Witnesses to appear, and to file and copy all Declarations
upon Actions in these Courts. Two Protonotaries, who draw and ingross all such
Declarations. Eight Clerk-sitters, who enter Actions and Attachments, and take
Bails and Verdicts.

In these Courts may be tried Actions of Debt, Case, Trespass, Account and
Covenants broken, Attachments, and Sequestrations. And, if either Party shall
have a Witness that cannot stay in London till the Day of Trial, his Testimony
may be taken in writing, which will be allowed as good Evidence.

As to the Chamberlain's Court, or Office, it is Kept in the Chamber of
Guildhall. As he is entrusted with the Cities Cash, and the Orphans Money, so
when he takes this Office upon him, he must give good Security to the Court of
Aldermen; and he is accountable to Auditors appointed and chosen for that
purpose. To him belongs the Business of Apprentices, over whom he has a great
Authority. Therefore he attends at Guildhall usually every Forenoon, to Inroll
and turn over Apprentices, and to make such Free as have duly served the full
Term of 7 Years, and have not married nor taken Wages in that Time.

When any Difference happens betwixt a Master and his Apprentice, the most
prudential Way is to refer the matter before the Chamberlain, who will freely
hear both Parties, and decide the Controversy for 3 Shill. Charge, viz. 1
Shill. to the Officer for the Summons, and 2 Shill. to the Clerk for the Order.
Whereas, if they proceed at Law for Relief, it may cost both Parties five or
six pounds in Charges; and the Conclusion may be less satisfactory, than if
decided by such Reference as aforesaid.

If an Apprentice shall be unruly or disorderly in his Master's House, or
commit any notorious Fault, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint made thereof) will
send one of his Officers for such Apprentice, and send him to Bridewell, or
punish him otherwise, according to the nature of the Offense.

And, if any Master shall misuse his Apprentice, by beating him unreasonably,
or with unlawful Weapons, or by neglecting to instruct him, or to find him
Necessaries, Mr. Chamberlain (upon Complaint thereof made) will send a Summons
for the Master to appear before him; and upon hearing both Parties, will
relieve the Apprentice, or leave him to take his Remedy against his Master in
the Lord Mayor's Court. And, if the Master shall refuse to appear before the
Chamberlain being duly Summoned, My Lord Mayor, or Mr. Recorder (upon Complaint
made thereof) will grant a Warrant to apprehend such Freeman, and compel him to
appear.

When an Apprentice is, by Consent of his Master, to be turned over to another
Master of the same Trade, it must be done first before the Company where he was
bound, and then before the Chamberlain. For hereby the first Master is
discharged from him, and the second obliged to keep him, as the Apprentice on
his side is obliged to serve him the full Term of the Indentures. Otherwise
there is no Obligation upon the second Master to Keep such Apprentice, nor upon
this to serve him, so that the Apprentice may sue out his Indenture against his
first Master.

If any Master shall refuse to make his Apprentice free when the Term in his
Indenture (...) expired, upon Complaint thereof made, Mr. Chamberlain will
cause the Master to be Summoned before him; and, if he cannot show good Cause
to the contrary, will make the Apprentice free.

Lastly, if any Freeman, to make an Appren^ice Free of London, do testify, that
he has ^eally served him the full Term of 7. Years, when he has not served him
so long, both he (...) the Apprentice may be Disfranchised, and ^ined at the
pleasure of Mr. Recorder, and Mr. Chamberlain will in such Case cause the
Freemans Shop to be shut up.

CHAP. XV.
Of the Orphans Court, the Court of Conscience or Requests, the Court for the
Conservation of the River, and the Pie-powder Court.

THE Orphans Court is held before the Mayor and Aldermen, who are Guardians to
the Children of all Freemen of London, that are or shall be under the Age of 21
Years at the time of their Father's Decease. This Court meets at Guildhall but
once a Year, viz. on the Monday morning after Midlent Sunday, which is termed
Call-Day. For then they meet purposely to hear the Name called over of all the
Securities that stand bound for Orphans Portions; and upon that Day on of every
of the Sureties ought to appear to give an Account, whether the other
Securities are living, and in good Condition, an^ whether the Orphans are
living and married.

If none of the Securities appear upon the Day, they forfeit their Bonds and
Recogn^zances. Then the Clerk of this Court (wh^ is always the youngest
Attorney in the Lo^ Mayor's Court) makes out Process against the^ forces 'em to
an Account, and they must pay the Charges of the Process.

But, that you may Know more fully how this great Concern of the Orphans is
managed for their benefit, and what Care is taken of their Welfare, I shall
make bold to enlarge a little upon this Subject, out of Lex Londinensis.

When a Freeman of London dies, leaving Children under Age, the Clerks of the
respective Parishes within the Bill of Mortality ought to give the Name of such
Freeman to the common Crier of the City. Who is thereupon to summon the Widow
or Executor of such Freeman to appear before the Court of Aldermen, there to be
bound to bring in an Inventory of the Testator's Estate, within the space of
two Months. And, that the Inventory may be given in due time, the Court of
Aldermen have made an Order, not to allow any finding Money (or Interest) for
any Money that shall be paid into the Chamber of London by any Executor or
Administrator belonging to any Freemans Estate, until such time as the Executor
or Administrator do bring in and exhibit upon Oath a true and perfect Inventory
to the best of his Knowledge.

If the Party summoned do not appear, the Lord Mayor sends his Warrant, and
forces an Appearance. And, if any Executor resuse to become bound to bring in
an Inventory, the Court of Aldermen have power to send him to Newgate, there to
remain till ^he submit; and the Courts at Westminster will not release such
Person.

After the Bond given, the Executor must procure 4 Freemen to appraise the
Testator's Goods. In order to which he must cause them to appear before a
Justice of Peace in London, and take their Oaths, that they shall make a just
and true Valuation and Appraisement of the Goods and Chattels of the Deceased,
according to the best of their Judgments and Skills.

When the Appraisement is to be made, the Common Crier is to have notice of it
beforehand, being appointed by the Court of Aldermen to see the same be fairly
done, and to the best advantage of the Orphan. And, unless the Common Crier, or
his Deputy be present, and the Inventory signed by the Common Crier, the Court
of Aldermen will not allow thereof.

The Appraisement being made as aforesaid, and signed by the Common Crier and
the Appraisers, it must be given to the Common Sergeant of the City, or one of
his Clerks, at his Office in Guildhall-Yard; he being the only Person entrusted
by the Court of Aldermen, to take all Inventories and Accounts of Freement
Estates. If he approves thereof, he will cause it to be Engrossed, and a
Duplicate of it to be made for the Executor or Administrator. And, when the
same is examined by him, and his hand set thereto in testimony thereof, the
Executor or Administrator must in the Court of Aldermen swear the same
Inventory to be a true Inventory of the Goods and Chattels of the Party
deceased, according to the best of his Knowledge.

When the Inventory is so exhibited, the Executor must become bound in a
considerable Penalty, either to bring in the Money that shall appear due to the
Orphans by the Inventory, or within two Months to give good Security to pay the
same into the Chamber of London for the Use of the Orphans, when they shall
come to Age, or be married.

If the Executor pay the Money into the Chamber of London, the Court of Aldermen
usually allow five per Cent Interest for so much Money of the Testator's Estate
as is due to the Orphans by the Custom of London, so as the same exceed not 500
l; and for Legacy-mony, 3 l. 6 s. 8. d. per Cent.

But, if the Executor shall not think fit to pay the Money into the Chamber, he
must become bound with 3 Sureties to the Chamberlain of London for the time
being in one or more Recognizances, or else by Bond to pay the Money due to
Orphans. And, in case the Security live within the Liberties of London, they
must be bound by Bond.

Now, as to Recognizances, the Custom is never to make any touching Orphans of
greater Penalty than 400 l. and not for the Payment of above 300. Therefore, if
the Sum (for Example) be 900 l. the Security must become bound by 3
Recognizances, each for the Payment of 300 l.

If a Freeman leaves Lands and Tenements to his Children, the Executor must
become bound with Sureties to account for the Rents and Profits thereof.

The Securities must take particular care that ^one of the Orphans marry, or be
put Appren^ice with their Consents, without the Leave of the Court of Aldermen
first obtained for that ^urpose. And as the Orphan comes to be of the Age of 21
Years, or to be married with the Consent of the Court of Aldermen, the
Securities must take care to bring him to Guildhall, with a person to prove his
Age. Then the Orphan must acknowledge satisfaction for the Money due to him, or
her, of the Testator's Estate, which must be done in the Court of Aldermen.
And, upon Motion made by Mr. Common Sergeant, the Court does order, that all
Bonds entered into for the Payment of such Orphan's Portion, shall be delivered
up, and cancelled. And, if the Security became bound by Recognizances, the
Clerk of the Orphans will cross and discharge such Recognizances.

The Chamber of London is counted the safest and best Security in or about
London (...) the Moneys paid therein to the Use of the City, or any Orphan,
being constantly repaid upon Demand, without any trouble. And when Orphans come
to Age, or be married with the Consent and Approbation of the Cou^ of Aldermen,
they may receive their Portion (if paid into the Chamber) at an hours notice
though the Sum be 10000 l. or more, M^ Chamberlain and his Clerks attending
daily (...) that purpose.

The finding (or Interest) Money is constantly paid as it becomes due; and the
Court ha^ always taken great Care, that every Orpha^ shall receive his (or her)
Portion out of the Chamber of London, without paying any other or greater Fees
than has been paid tim^ out of mind.

The Custody of Orphans is committed by the Court of Aldermen to such Person or
Persons as they think fit. And, if any Person whatsoever do intermarry with any
Orpha^ without Leave of the said Court, such Person may be fined by that Court,
according to the quality and portion of the Orphan. And, un^^ less such Person
do pay the Fine, or give Bon^ to pay the same in some reasonable Tim^ though he
shall have ten times a better Estate (...) the Orphan he intermarries, yet the
Court may commit him to Newgate, there to remain ^^til the Fine be paid. But,
if he settle an Estate upon the Orphan as the Court shall di^^ct, and make
application to the Court ^^y Petition to have the Fine remitted, they ^ill in
probability show favor to such Person, as they have done in the like Ca^s.

The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London in Common Council,
^ave made several good Acts and Orders to pre^ent Freemens Children from
Marrying without the Consent of their Parents and Guardians, and to keep them
from vicious Courses. More ^articularly an Act of Common Council, called Judds
Law, made in the Mayoralty of Sir Andrew Judd, Knight, in the Fifth year of
King ^dward VI. Which Law, though unrepealed, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen have
sometimes for special Reasons thought fit to dispense with, in favor of
Orphans that have ^ought Relief against the Penalties therein mentioned.

By the Custom of London, a Freemans Wi^ow may require a third part of his
Personal ^state after his Debts paid, and Funeral Char^es discharged, besides
her Widows Chamber ^mished; and his Children may require ano^er third part
thereof. The other third part ^f his Estate he may by his last Will give away,
^ther to his Wife, or any of his Children, or any other Person whatsoever. But,
if he die ^thout Issue, his Widow may require a Moity ^f his personal Estate,
after Debts paid, together ^ith her Widows Chamber furnished. And, (...) a
Freeman make his Will contrary to this Custom, and give away more than a third
of his Estate from his Wife and Children, they may be relieved against such
Will, by exhibiting their Bill in this Court against the Executor, and so much
of his Will as shall be contrary to the Custom, will be declared void and of
none effect.

But, if a Freeman die without a Will, and leave a Wife and Children, this
Court grants Administration of his Estate to his Widow By the Custom of London
she will claim a third part of his Estate, one third must be divided amongst
his Children, and the other third between the Wife and Children; but so that
usually the Widow is allowed two Thirds of the Freemans third part, and the
Children one Third thereof.

If a Freeman shall in the time of his last Sickness give and deliver any part
of his Goods, Chattels, or Moneys to his Wife or Child, or any other Person,
with Intent that such Person shall keep the same to his or her own Use; such
Gift, being against the Custom of London, shall be accounted part of the
Freemans Estate at the time of his Death, and may be recovered by Bill in this
Court. For a Freman cannot in the time of his Sickness whereof he shall die,
give away any part of his Estate, otherwise than by his last Will.

If a Freeman, having given in his Lifetime part of his Estate to any of his
Children, in Marriage or otherwise, do afterward make his Will, and give all
his Estate away to his other Children, with a Declaration that the Child he so
disposed in Marriage, had received 500 l. or more of his Estate, and was
thereby fully advanced; such Declaration shall not bar the Person so married,
but he or she may recover after the Father's Decease an equal share with the
other Children. But then the Money received of his Father in his Lifetime, must
come into the Account, and be reckoned part of the Estate left by him at his
Death. Which is called bringing of the Money into Hotchpot.

Moreover, if a Freeman shall settle or make over any part of his Estate to the
Use of his Children, with design to defraud his Wife of her full third Part,
the Widow may, after his Death, set aside such Settlement by a Bill in this
Court.

Lastly, when an Inventory is exhibited in this Court, and the Orphans can
prove any Goods omitted or undervalued, or any Debts charged to be owing from
the Deceased, which were not real and just Debts; In such Case, upon Complaint
made, the Clerk will summon a Jury, to inquire whether the Inventory so
exhibited be a true and perfect Inventory or not. And, if the Jury find any
Omissions, Undervaluations, or Surcharges, then the Clerk will sue the Executor
upon the Bond he gave for exhibiting an Inventory, and will thereby compel him
to make so much as shall be found by the Jury to be omitted, undervalued, or
surcharged. Unless he can by Proof discharge himself thereof before the Court
of Aldermen; who, upon Application made by any Executor, will examine into his
Accounts, and do right to all Parties, without any Expense to the Executor or
the Orphans.

And, when it shall appear by an Inventory, that many Debts are standing out
due to the Deceased, the Court of Aldermen do constantly compel the Executor to
give Bond, to render a true Account from time to time, when he shall be
thereunto required; which is usually once in a Twelvemonth. And, if upon the
Exhibiting thereof, it shall appear that any Money is due to the Orphans, the
Executor must either pay it into the Chamber of London, or give good Security
to pay the same. Which if he omit, or refuse, his Bond will be put in Suit
against him.

The Court of Conscience, otherwise called the Court of Requests, is a Court
established and settled by an Act of Parliament in the 3d Year of the Reign of
King James I. Which Impowers this Court to hear, examine, and determine with
Equity or good Conscience, all Matters brought before them, between Party and
Party, Citizens of London, where the Debt does not amount to forty shillings.
An Act very beneficial, both for the Relief of such poor Debtors as cannot make
present Payment of their Debts, and for such poor Persons as have small Debts
owing to them, and are not able to prosecute a Suit in Law for the same.

This Court sits in Guildhall every Wednesday and Saturday in the Forenoon,
consisting of two Aldermen and four Commoners, monthly appointed by the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen; but any three of them make a Court.

A Cause may be brought and determined in this Court for 10 pence Charge, viz.
6 pence for the Plaint and the Summons, and 4 pence for the Order. But, if the
Defendant do not appear the second Court-Day after Summons, an Attachment will
be awarded against him, which will compel him to appear, and increase the
Charge.

If any Citizen be Arrested for a Debt under ^o Shill. this Court will grant a
Summons for the Plaintiff in the Action. And, if he appear not the first
Court-day after the Summons left at his House, the same will grant an
Attachment against him, force him to take his Debt, and to pay the Defendant
his Costs.

The Court for the Conservation of the Thames is held before the Lord Mayor at
such Times ^s he appoints and directs within the respective Counties near
adjacent to the Cities of London and Westminster.

The Water-Bayliff for the time being is My Lord Mayors Deputy, and ought to
give notice to his Lordship of all Offenses committed by any Persons, contrary
to the Orders made for Preservation of the Brood and Fry of Fish in the said
River. To which purpose he is by this Court Ordered and Empowered, from time to
time to Authorize Two ^onest Fishermen or more, in such Town and Places as he
shall think convenient, as well be^ow as above the Bridge, to be assistant to
him ^n the Execution of his Duty, and (when they shall think fit) to go out and
search for any ^uch Offenders, take away their Nets, and give their Names to
Mr. Water-Bayliff, that they (...) severely proceeded against according to ^aw.

This Power of the Lord Mayor for the Conservation of the River of Thames, and
the ^unishment of all Offenses within it, has been ^ercised by the Mayor of
London and his ^redecessors time out of mind. By King Edward the Thirds Charter
to this City, the Citizens are Authorized to remove and take away all Kidels in
the Water of the River of Thames and Medway, and have the Punishment to the
King belonging thereof coming. And, by a Statute made in the 17th Year of the
Reign of Richard II. it is Ordained, that the Mayor of London shall have the
Conservacy of the Thames, and put in execution the Statutes of 13 Edward I. and
13 Richard II. from the Bridge of Stanes to London, and from thence over the
same Water, and in the Water of Medway.

The Pie-Powder Court is a Court held during the first 3 Days of Bartholomews
Fair, by Stewards assigned by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, to examine
and try all Suits brought for petty Matters and Offenses there committed,
contrary to the Proclamation made on Bartholomew Eve in the Afternoon at the
great Gate going into the Cloth-Fair, for the better regulating this Fair.

Besides the foresaid Courts, every Alderman keeps a Court in his Ward, called
Wardmote, for Things relating to his Ward; but still under the Direction of the
Lord Mayor. Who annually issues out his Precept to every Alderman to hold his
Wardmote, for the Election of Common Council-Men and other Officers.

The Companies of Traders have also their Courts called Halmotes, for
regulating what belongs to their several Trades; and so called from the Halls
(or Assembly Places) where they meet, many of them very stately Buildings.

CHAP. XVI.
Of the Punishments inflicted on Malefactors.

IN the 9th Chapter of this Part I have shown at large the Manner of Trying
Criminals in England; wherein is to be commended our English Humanity toward
Prisoners that are upon their Trial. When other Nations, under pretense that no
Man ought to be put to Death but upon his own Confession of the Crime he stands
charged with, have devised such racking Tortures to extort the Confession, as
make often the Innocent cry Guilty, and prefer Death to the Rack. But this I
have already touched upon in my first Part.

My Business is now to speak of the Punishments inflicted here upon Criminals
of what nature soever.

Hanging is the usual Punishment to Death in England, either for High Treason,
Petty Treason, or Felony. But the Manner is different.

For a Traitor to the King and Government is to be drawn upon a Hurdle or
Sledge to the Gallows, and there to be hanged by the Neck. But then he is
presently cut down ^live, his Entrals pulled out of his Belly and ^urnt before
his Face, his Head cut off, and his Body divided into four Parts, and both the
Head and Body hung up or impaled where the King shall command.

This Punishment indeed, considering all its Circumstances, seems cruel to such
as do not narrowly consider the nature of the Crime. Whereas the Law thinks it
but reasonable, that whosoever endeavors to cut off the King, or rend the
Government, should be himself cut off and rent, as before said.

As for his Lands and Goods, they are for^eited to the King; his Wife, if
married, loses her Dower; and, if he be Noble, his Children lose their Right of
Nobility, as well as Inheritance. For, by the Law, Treason taints the Blood.

But it is observable, as to the Kings Person, that it is not only downright
killing (or murdering) the King which makes it High Treason. For the very
imagining (or contriving) his Death, without any overt Act, is High Treason.

Falsifying and Clipping of Money is also High Treason, by Law. But the
Offender's Punishment is only to be Drawn, and Hanged by the Neck, till he be
dead.

The same it is with one guilty of Petty Treason, as when a Servant kills his
Master or Mistress, a Wife her Husband, or a Clergyman his Prelate, to whom he
ow's Obedience.

For Felony, as Murder, Theft or Robbery, and other Capital Crimes, for which
anciently there were several sorts of Punishments, the Malefactor is but
Hanged, since the Reign of Henry I.

But, when the Robbery is attended with Murder, the Criminal, after he is
hanged and dead, is taken down to be hanged in Chains; and so to hang in
terrorem till the Body be quite rotted off, or eaten up by the Birds of the Air.

As to Persons of great Birth and Quality, convicted of High Treason, Petty
Treason, or Felony, tho the Judgment be the same with that of common Persons,
yet by the Kings Favor they are usually Beheaded. Which is performed with an
Ax, upon a Block lying on the Scaffold; and not as in other Countries, by a
Sword, kneeling or standing.

The Notion of Murder, as a Capital Crime, invites me to explain two Law-Terms
relating to it, viz. Manslaughter and Chance-medley.

Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of one without prepensed Malice. As when
two, that formerly meant no harm one to another, meet together; and falling out
upon some sudden Occasion, the one kills the other. It differs from Murder,
because it is not done with foregoing Malice; and from Chancemedley, because
it has a present Intent to kill. It Is Felony, but it is allowed the Benesit of
the Clergy for the first time.

Chance-medley, otherwise called Manslaughter by Misadventure, signifies the
casual Killing of a Man, not altogether without the Killer's Fault, though
without an evil Intent; for which the Offender shall have his Pardon of course.
But here must be considered, whether the Offender, when he committed this
Manslaughter by Chance-medley, was doing a lawful Thing. For, if the Act were
unlawful, it is Felony. As if two are fighting together, and a third Man comes
to part them, and is killed by one of the two, without any Malice forethought,
or evil Intent in him that killed the Man, yet this is Murder in him, and not
Manslaughter by Chance-medley or Misadventure, because they two that fought
together were doing an unlawful Act. And, if they were met with prepensed
Malice, the one intending to kill the other, then it is Murder in them both.

Burning alive is sometimes used, but only for Witches, and Women convicted of
High Treason, or Petty Treason.

In the Time of Popery, especially in the Reign of Queen Mary, this was the
proper Punishment for Heretics, that is, in the Popish Sense, for Protestants.
When the Papists, who ever delighted in humane Sacrifices, made Bonefires of
them, and reserved Hell-fi^e for themselves.

Pressing to Death, called by the Law Peine forte and dure, is a Punishment for
those only that being Arraigned either of Petty Treason or Felony, refuse to
Answer, or to put themselves upon the ordinary Trial of God and the Country.
Which by the Law is called to stand Mute. And for this Contumacy the Offender
is to be sent back to the Prison whence he came, there to be laid in some low
dark Room, all naked but his privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground, his
Arms and Legs stretched with Cords fastened to the several Quarters of the
Room. Then is laid upon his Body Iron and Stone as much as he may bear, or
more. The next Day he shall have three morsels of Barley-bread without Drink;
and the Day after he shall have for his Drink as much of the next Water to the
Prison as he can drink three several times, except it be running Water, and
that without any bread. And this is to be his Diet, till he Die. Which grievous
kind of Death some stout Men have chosen, to save their Estates to their
Children, and keep their Blood from being stained. But, in case of High
Treason, though the Criminal stand mute, yet Judgment shall be given against
him as if he had been Convicted, and his Estate shall be Confiscated.

In many Parts beyond Sea the Criminals hanged or beheaded are denied Christian
Burial, their Society being declined in the Grave who were not fit to live in
the World. In England, where they are charitably looked upon as reconciled to
God upon their penitent Departure out of this World, their Friends are allowed
to inter them decently where they think fit. He therefore that has Friends to
look to his Burial go's to the Place of Execution, his Coffin in the Cart with
him, a good Memento Mori. And, after he has hanged about a quarter of an hour,
he is cut down, laid in his Coffin, and conveyed in a Coach to the Place from
whence he is designed to be buried. But Apostates, Heretics, and Extorsioners,
all perjured Persons, and such as die Excommunicate, also any one that is Felo
de se, or that has wittingly made himself away, all such are by Law denied
Christian Burial. And so are for the most part Men that die for High Treason,
and Robbers guilty of Murder.

For Petty Larceny, or small Theft, that is under the ancient value of 12 d.
the Punishment since Edward III. is by Whipping, and in the late Reigns has
been often by Transportation into the West Indies, where they live for some
Years a slavish Life. But, if the Ofsender be found by the Jury to have fled
for the same, he forfeits all his Goods.

For Misprision of High Treason, that is, for neglecting or concealing it, the
Offender's Punishment is Forfeiture of the Profits of his Lands during Life,
and of all his Goods, besides Imprisonment for Life.

Perjury, whereby Men's Estates, Reputation, and Lives ly at stake, is commonly
punished only with the Pillory; never with Death, though it has cost the Lives
of many. It Is true a Perjurer Convict is by Law incapable of being a Witness,
or Administrator, or of bearing any public Office. And, in the strictness of
the Law, he ought to be burnt in the forehead with a P, his Goods to be
Confiscated, and his Trees growing upon his Ground rooted up.

But all this is counted too little by those Nations where wilful Perjury is
punished with Death. At least it seems but equitable, which is the Practice of
Spain, that the Perjurer should suffer the same Punishment which he intended
for another by his Perjury.

Forgery, Blasphemy, Cheating, Libelling, False Weights and Measures,
Forestalling the Market, Offenses in Baking and Brewing, are also punished with
standing in the Pillory. But sometimes the Offender is Sentenced besides to
have one or both Ears nailed to the Pillory and cut off, or his Tongue there
bored through with a hot Iron.

For Striking in the Kings Court, so as to draw Blood, the Criminal is to have
his right Hand cut off in a most solemn manner. And for Striking in
Westminster Hall, whilst the Courts of Justice are there sitting, the Offender
is imprisoned during Life, and all his Estate forfeited.

For one found in a Praemunire, that is, one who incurs the same Punishment
which was inflicted on those who transgressed the Statute of Rich. II. commonly
called the Statute of Praemunire (which Statute was properly made against such
as avouched the Popes pretended Right of bestowing by Provision most of the
best Livings in England, by Mandates,) the Punishment is Forfeiture of all his
Estate, to be put out of the King's Protection, and Imprisoned during the
King's Pleasure.

Vagabonds, and the like, who can give no good account of themselves, are
punished by setting their Legs in the Stocks for certain hours. And Scolding
Women (that are always teazing their Neighbors) by being set in a Cucking
Stool placed over some deep Water and duck'd therein three several times, to
cool their heat and choler.

Other Misdemeanors are commonly punished with Imprisonment or Fines, and
sometimes with both.

Those are the Corporal Punishments commonly used in England for Criminals that
happen to fail into the hands of Justice. But there are also Spiritual
Punishments, such as concern the Soul especially, and are in the power of the
Spiritual Courts. It Is true they are but seldom put into practice, but let us
see however what the Law is in this point.

First, for refusing to appear in the Ecclesiastical Court upon Summons, or for
not obeying the Orders of the Court, the Party Delinquent is admonished. If he
slight the Admonition, then comes upon him Minor Excommunicatio, the Lesser
Excommunication, whereby he is Excommunicated, or excluded from the Church; if
not from the Church, at least from the Communion of the Lords Supper. And by
this lesser Excommunication, he is disinabled to be Plaintiff in a Lawsuit,
etc. Which Power of Excommunication the Bishop may delegate to any grave Priest
with the Chancellor.

But for Heresy, Incest, Adultery, Perjury, and other grievous Crimes,
Excommunicatio major, or the greater Excommunication, is used, and pronounced
by the Bishop himself in person. Now this is not only an Exclusion from the
Company of Christians in Spiritual Duties, but also in Temporal Concerns. For a
Person so excommunicated cannot in any Civil or Ecclesiastical Court be
Plantiff, or Witness. And, if he continue 40 Days Excommunicated, without
acknowledging and giving satisfaction for his Offense, the Chancery grants the
King's Writ against him, De Excommunicato capiendo, to take him up and cast him
into Prison, without Bail; where he is to ly, till he has fully satisfied for
his Offense.

Then comes the Anathema, but this is only inflicted upon an obstinate
Heretic. Whereby he is declared a public Enemy of God, cursed, and delivered
over to eternal Damnation. And this is to be ^one by the Bishop himself in
Person, assisted by the Dean and Chapter, or twelve other grave Priests.

Sometimes the Delinquent is compelled to make a public Confession of his
Fault, and to bewail it in the Church before the whole Congregation. Now this
is called a public Penance, and the Manner of it is thus. The Delinquent is to
stand in the Church Porch upon a Sunday, bare-headed and barefooted, in a
white Sheet, and with a white Rod in his hand. Having there bewailed himself,
and begged every one that passes by to pray for him, he enters the Church,
falling down, and Kissing the Ground. Then he is placed in the middle of the
Church in a conspicuous Place over against the Minister. Who makes a Discourse
upon the foulness of his Crime, and having received his humble Acknowledgement
of the same, and his solemn Promise with God's help and assistance to watch
more carefully for the time to come against the Temptations of the World, the
Flesh, and the Devil, pronounces in Christ's Name the Absolution. The Penitent
on his side humbly beseeches the Congregation to pardon him, and receive him
into their holy Communion, and in testimony thereof to vouchsafe out of their
Christian Charity, to say with him aloud the Lord's Prayer. Which seems to be
the Way used by the Primitive Churches.

But, when the Crime is not notorious and public, the foresaid Penance may,
by the Canons of the Church, be commuted (at the Parties Request) into a
Pecuniary Mulct, for the Poor of the Parish, or some pious Uses; Provided that
it may appear to be the more proble Way for the Delinquents Reformation. Such
is the Temper of some Men that, far from being likely to be reclaimed by a
publication of their Offense, they will rather grow obdurate and impudent, when
they perceive their Reputation to be lost.

To all the foresaid Punishments and Censures of the Church both the Laity and
Clergy are subject. But there are other Punishments to which the faulty Clergy
only are liable, which are four in Number; commonly called Suspensio ab
Officio, Suspensio a Beneficio, Deprivatio a Beneficio, and Deprivatio ab
Officio.

The first is, when a Minister for a time is declared unfit to execute his
Office. The second, when he is for some time deprived of the Profits of his
Benefice. Both which are wont to be for smaller Crimes.

Deprivatio a Beneficio, is when a Minister, for a greater Crime, is wholly,
and for ever deprived of his Living. And the last is, when he is wholly and for
ever deprived of his Orders; which is properly called in English a Deposing, or
Degradation.

This is commonly for some heinous, or Capital Crime. And then the Minister is
solemnly stripped by the Bishop of his Priestly Vestments in the presence of the
Civil Magistrate, to whom he is then delivered to be Punished as a Layman for
the like Offense.

Of the Martial Court.
THis Court you have too short an Account of, in my Third Part, Page 91. I
therefore beg leave here to enlarge upon it.

It Is called the Martial (or Military) Court, or High Court of Chivalry,
otherwise the Court of Honor, and in Latin, Curia Militaris. The Place
anciently appointed for holding thereof was the King's Hall, wherein the
Constable and Earl Marshal of England sat as Judges. Where any Plaintiff, in
case of Dignities, or Matters of Arms, or of any other Suit or Controversy
concerning Nobility, Gentility, or Arms, might sue the Defendant. But now, that
great Office of Constable of England is hid aside, the whole Power is vested in
the Earl Marshal. And the Present Possessor of that honorable Office is his
Grace Henry, Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England. Who has appointed the
Hall in the College of Arms to be the Place for Keeping the said Court. And,
upon Application made to him by any of the Nobility or Gentry of this Kingdom,
being abused in Matters of Honor and Arms, may there have relief from his
Grace.
