ACADE. MIA. OXONI. ENSIS. (...).

March 22. 1651. By the Vice Chancellor and Heads of Houses.
WHEREAS by the rude carriage of several Scholars in this University, both in
the public Schools, under the notion of Coursing, and also in the Streets,
several tumultuous disorders have been lately committed, to the disturbance of
the public Peace, and great scandal of the University: for preventing the
like for the time to come, and the dangerous consequents which may ensue
thereof, the Vice Chancellor and Heads of Houses do hereby straightly require
and enjoyne all and every persons under the jurisdiction of the University,
that they forbear for the future all such disorders upon pain of Expulsion,
according to the Statutes of the University in that behalf provided. And all
Tutors are hereby required to have a more vigilant eye over such Scholars as
are under their respective charges, in regard that any miscarriage of theirs
will have a deep reflection upon those that have the oversight of them.

Signed in the name, and by the consent of the Heads of Houses, by DAN.
GREENWOOD Vice-Can:
