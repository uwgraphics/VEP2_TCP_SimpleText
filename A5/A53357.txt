On the Most High and Mighty Monarch King JAMES the II. His Exaltation on the
Throne of ENGLAND. Being an Excellent New SONG.
To the Tune of, Hark, the Thundering Canons Roar. ^
[1]
HArk! the Bells and Steeples Ring!
Health to JAMES our Royal K.
Heaven approves the Offering
Resounding in a CHORUS;
Let your Sacrifice aspire,
Richest Gums Perfume the Fire,
Angels, and the Sacred Quire
Have led the way before us.
[2]
Through loud Storms and Tempests driven,
This wronged Prince to Us was given,
The mighty James, preserved by Heaven
To be a future Blessing:
The Anointed Instrument,
Good Great CHARLES to Represent,
And fill our Souls with that Content,
Which we are now possessing.
[3]
Justice, Plenty, Wealth and Peace,
With the Fruitful Lands Increase,
All the Treasure of the Seas,
With Him to Us are given.
As the Brother, Just, and Good,
From whose Royal Father's Blood,
Clemency runs like a Flood,
A Legacy from Heaven.
[4]
Summoned young to fierce Alarms,
Born a Mars in midst of Arms,
His good Angel kept from Harms,
The Peoples Joy and VVonder;
Early Laurels Crowned his Brow,
And the Crowd did Praise allow,
Whilst against the Belgic Foe*
Great Jove employed his Thunder.
[5]
Like Him none e're filled the Throne,
Never Courage yet was known
With so much Conduct met in One,
To claim our due Devotion;
Who made the Belgic Lion Roar,
Drove 'em back to their own Shore,
To humble, and Incroach no more
Upon the British Ocean.
[6]
When poor Holland first grew Proud,
Saucy, Insolent, and Loud,
Great James subdued the boyst'rous crowd,
The foamy Ocean Stemming;
His Countries Glory, and its Good
He valued dearer than his Blood,
And rid sole Soverign over the Flood,
In spite of French or Flemming.
[7]
When He the Foe had overcome,
Brought them Peace and Conquest home,
Exiled, in Foreign Parts to Roam,
^Ungrateful REBELS Vote Him:
But spite of all their Insolence,
Inspired with God-like Patience,
The Rightful Heir, kind Providence
Did to a Throne promote Him.
[8]
May Justice at his Elbow wait,
To Defend the CHURCH and STATE,
The Subject, and This Monarch's Date,
May no Storm e're dissever:
May he long Adorn this Place,
With His Royal Brother's Grace,
His Mercy, and his Tenderness,
To Rule this Land for ever.
Printed by N. Thompson at the Entrance into Old Spring-garden near
Charing Cross. 1685.
