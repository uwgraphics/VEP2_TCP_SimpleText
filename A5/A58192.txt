FOLLY IN PRINT, OR, A Book of RYMES.

Whoever buys this Book will say,
There Is so much Money thrown away:
The Author thinks you are to blame,
To buy a Book without a Name;
And to say truth, it is so bad,
A worse is no where to be had.
London, Printed in the year, 1667.

To the Reader.
Courteous Reader,
THE whole world (imaginably) is but one great market; and all mankind in it,
are distinguished into buyers and sellers, who either truck for, or buy
Commodities; particularly in Books, where for money or exchange, we take our
choice, and in our own Election please our selves; Men's judgments, as their
appetites are very different, the Market's free to buy or cheapen: who buys
upon the sellers word, may be deceived, who chooses ill deceives himself.

I do not promise for my Book nor say it is good, but here is variety and each
man (of his own pallat) is the certain judge: it may please some, to them it is
good, by whom disliked, to them as bad.

When the Gazets are cried, we buy in expectation of some thing new, yet
though the news be never so good, in three days time'tis laid aside, though we
were pleased with our penny worth: I cannot expect a better fortune in this
composition, it is now exposed to your censure; If it meet with generous
Patrons, I am obliged to serve you again, and better, from your encouragement.

Farewell.

Folly in Print: OR, A Book of Rhymes.
The Cotsal Sheapheards.
To the Tune of Amarillis told her Swain.
ALL ye that love, or who pretends,
Come listen to my Sonnet,
Black-baggs or vizards, who have friends,
Or English Teags or Bonnets,
See here our Sheapheardess, and Swain,
How they make love on Cotsall Plain.
Bis. Amarillis why so coy,
Think thou that the winged Boy,
Can never overtake thee;

Bis. Colin (no) I fly not him
But thou who wilt forsake me.

Bis. Dearest I forsake my Sheep,
And forget to eat or sleep,
To follow Amarillis,
And dying lie down at thy feet,
Since such thy cruel will is.

Treason makes a goodly show,
Black that is covered ore with Snow;
The eye does not discover,
I must have more assurance yet
E're I become a Lover.
In extremest winter cold,
I hunt Foxes from thy fould,
Nor will I marry Phillis;
But in thine abscence close mine eyes,
and call on Amarillis.
Yet thou did the other day
At our pastoralls in May,
Hear Coridon to jeere me;
Who said I was not yet so fair,
That Colin need to fear me.
Envy cannot make thee foul,
Nor fine words make fayrer fool;
Nor Clownes can change their natures.
'Ile dye to tell the world that you
Exceed them all in features.
Colin live, for I am thine,
Drive thy Flocks up unto mine,
I Will yield to thy Embraces;
And Chant thee pleasing Round delays,
Do thou foot comely Paces.
Happy Collin, fairest Maid,
My grief and care, thou have allayed,
With words so sweetly charming,
Now on this Bank, thou shall confess
I fear no others harming.
Dearest Colin stay awhile,
The time with talk we will beguile,
Till Evening shall befriend us;
We Will then take in, that happiness
Which love anon will send us.
Now Colin, Amarillis now
He did, she did, swear and vow,
They Would never part asunder;
Forsworn they part, and meet again,
But that is no lovers wonder.
The English Seamans Fortune, with a Dutch Ufro, at the burning of Scelling.
To the Tune of Phillis though thy powerful Charms.
Fair Maids who pass by, give ear to my song,
So short and so sweet, you will not think it long
Come buy all my Ballads, I have no more,
Rich hangings for walls, or your Chamber door.
To The Sea brave English men apace,
The Prizes stay, till you give chase,
One broadside, down their Colors fall,
Divide the purchase, amongst you all,
Then each man to his mate shall say,
God send us such another day,
We need no more at Sea to Roame,
With Nan and Boss, weel fight at home.
Your Merchant Voyages are long,
The Seas are rough and Pirates strong,
And when you have toyld for little pay,
One Frolic spends it in a day:
The Dutchmen are your Indies now,
And victory will crown your Brow;
Your Country shall your welcome sing,
The Bells within your Pockets ring.
Some few, as happily are dead,
Who living lie, in honours-bedd:
What City, Town, or Village can
But boast, that they had such a man:
Who killed ten Dutchmen ere he fell,
And thousand Canons rung his knell:
The swift rebounding Echoes fly
To tell the world it is I, it is I.
Those who before had names unknown,
Are now proclaimed, by Trumpets blown,
Great Generals, and men of fame,
Are fellow Actors, in this game;
How bravely have you chose to dye,
Remembered in such company,
Whilst others are in surfets drowned,
And dye forgotten, ye are crowned.
But now the storm, and Scheling fire,
A true relation does, require:
The landing fight, and bold advance,
The Soldiers wish 'Thad been in France,
But wine and Feathers, or Kich-chose,
Can never make amends, for blows;
Ye must have plunders rich, and prize,
To dazzle the beholders eyes.
The Newes-books tells us of the fact,
How Holmes and others there did act,
Of Bibles, Knives, and silver Spoons,
Of Carpets wrought, in Turkish moons,
Of Pewter, Brass, and such like stuff
To frait the Fleet there was enough,
But I remember must my friend
To whom this Ballad I commend.
His Father amongst the Cavaliers,
Had paid for jealousies and fears,
This son the youngest was of three,
His fortune small, must go to Sea,
Where he has had a lucky hitt,
Through courage added to his wit,
And brought a fire, (to warm his bed)
From Schelling, a Dutch-Maydenhead.
A Maid amongst the fairest fair,
Black-eye, and slender, Debonaire
And by Dewitt, her uncle sent,
To see her Aunt, in Complement;
Who when the English landed there,
Surpised with such a sudden fear,
Gave all her Jewels to her niece,
But they were our Seamans Golden Fleece.
For as she trembling, stood to gaze,
When first the fire, began to blaze
O^^ Mariner, who that way came
Saw be^, he thought, the greater flame,
Whom she endeavored not to shun
But Fate directing, to him run,
Mine Liven-here, but save my life
She said, and take me for thy wife.
He'rs Rings, and Jewels, Gold and Pearl
Enough, to make an English Earl;
He took her in his arms, and swore,
He wished her less, to love her more;
Then changed her habit having found,
A man's was dropped upon the ground;
Aboard he goes, with his fine boy,
And now, I hope you will give them joy.
The Captain viewing well his prise
A ransom offered to those eyes,
Believing something there of note
Was Clouded in a Seamans Coat;
But she replied this Mariner
Brought me aboar'd, his Prisoner
From all, but him, I must be free,
His Cabbin-mate, I mean to be.
In little time, on shore they went,
And to the west their journey bent;
When at his Fathers P^ivate seat
They both, their fortunes, did repeat,
Then married were and brought to bed
Till then, she kept her Maydenhead,
And since, with Jewels, which they sold,
A Manor bought, with English Gold.
Three merry Boys of Kent.
To the Tune of an old song, beginning thus I rode from England into France. Or
to the Tune of Sir John Sucklings Ballad.
IF you can find it out, Hear's wit,
The Poet thought so when he writ,
but looking over it again,
He found not one Conceit in ten
Who ever writes, in prose or verse,
Gives black and white to his own hearse;
When you have paid, and seen a play,
You Will bear more (hence) for less, away.
Of Mandeville, I do not tell,
Nor Cromwells Citadel in Hell;
No Quaker Dog, nor wife,
Nor of the King of France at Breast,
With fourscore thousand horse, at least,
Who dance to Drumm, and fife.
Of three good fellows, I must sing,
Who love good wine, obey the King;
And in a pleasant fit
Of late, at Temple stairs took horse,
I wish all women, do no worse,
For we cross-legg'd did sit.
But straight we heard a Swine-heards horn
Who called his Cattle forth the Corn,
Where they broke in to root;
Yet in such haste, came to the trough,
As if they nere could have enough
The Dele and all to boot.
Such fat black hoggs in Spain we saw
Where they have all this common law
So soon as fat are killed;
If some black cloaks were served so
They would not sweat and labor so,
To get their bellies filled.
Then close by Bridewel Dock we came,
Where pretty sinners spinn for Fame
And hemp for Newgate beat,
But Kingdoms have their certain date
And Londons sad, and Dooms-days fate
Has made them change their seat.
But we affrighted at the ghosts,
Of chimnyes, steeples, half burnt posts
Tot'h bridge, we swiftly came,
Where fire and water seemed to agree,
I Will burn this part, leave that to thee,
Yet both increased the flame.
Then we approached the water fall
And through a breach, in that old wall
Like Soldiers entered in,
Where we surrounded were with noise
As if that there ten thousand boys,
Were carting Bawds for sin.
Digression.
Old Porter Tame, at Denmark stayrs
By Isis (water-nymph) had heirs
Who in the west are bred;
Yet twice a day, run to and fro,
Saluting Parents as they go
And see their Subjects sedd.
In former times, they had a war
With Neighbors who incroach'd so far,
Their Subjects did complain
Unless a peace they would agree
And open trade into the sea,
They should no longer reign.
At length agreed, a league was made
That both the land, and the sea trade
Should equally divide;
And made a bridge with Avenues The two Statues at Somerset stairs of Tame and
Isis. Two Rivers joining makes Thamesis the heirs, little brooks from the West
running into Thames fish their Subjects. When the Bridge was built this water
was turned against Somerset House over the fields, below Redriff,

Which neither party shall abuse
Or by a law be tried.
At Billingsgate we then arrive
And found no people there alive
But Oysters gaping wide,
And sure had they had tongues would tell
What nasty Jades brought them to sell
Which cannot be denied.
Those Bacchanalians we found
Strowd here and there upon the ground
Where such discoveries;
Columbus nor Sir Francis Drake
In all their voyages did make
Nor such gulfes enterprise.
A thigh uncloathed, not bare, nor skinn
But scales of fish where flesh had been
A leg with piss-dy'd clout,
A pack-thred gatter which had tied
A horse leg, that o'th farcy died,
And such was all the rout.
Had legions of Devils been
But there they might have entered in
Their breaches were so wide,
Had not a Herricane of wine
Broke forth from all parts, like sea-brine
To cool the Devils pride.
These haggs it seems a cellar found
Where in Canary they were drowned
And drank in Oyster pecks;
Then rould themselves in postures more
Then Aretine ere taught before
But saved their drunken necks.
Again our wodden horse we spurr;
After at least an hours demurre,
The bell at Tower did ring;
Where we the Lions could not see
There was so much Presbitery
Who came to hear them sing.
Going from thence on the other side
The wind and water-mills we spied
It Is not so strange as true,
The millers grind for every Maid
And take no Toll, but she is paid
The Del'e must have his due.
Then downwards we to Wapping glide
Where brave bold Pirates have been tied
In bonds to drink no more;
Yet made to drink, though not adry
Water, wherein they swimm and fly
Who drank good wine before. 3 Tides they are to hang till the water overflow
them and ebbs as often.

At Ratcliffe now we would not touch
The Seaman lately did so much,
They needed not our aid;
But unto Cuckolds Haven came,
Those Horns of fortune, and of fame,
Makes all the world afraid.
The Butchers in the Romans time,
And so the Butchers in our clime
Do offer Sacrifice.
To fortune, Rome a Temple built,
And they a Poast with Horns have guilt,
That Dazzled all our eyes.
This place miscalled, weeping cross,
Where he that gets, laments his loss;
It Is jealousy creates
More Knights of Fame, with Coats and crests,
Then Ireland sent us horned beasts,
Before the last debates.
But we would have the Irish go,
Unless they bring their women too
Blew bonnets and mafoyes;
Let altogether homewards trudge,
We have enough at home can drudg,
And get our women boys.
But now our homages were paid,
Our selves to Deptford we conveyed,
You must not think it much
That they build there, strong Towns of wood,
Are garrisoned with men and food,
To beat the saucy Dutch.
At Greenwich then we went on shore,
Our Countrymen were in a Roar,
Who thought we had been lost,
But our adventures being told,
They swore that we were very cold,
Which we believed before.
God bless the Town, we called for fire
And sack that warms a little higher,
And for a Maid and meat;
The Bells bid welcome to the Town,
And all the lasses up and down,
Are now prepared to treat.
The Hampshire Maid, or the Wenches Progress.
Fair Mayds and young Men,
Come circle me round,
There Is not one in ten,
If bucksome and sound,
But here will commend our blithe Hampshire lass,
And do as she did, what ere comes to pass,
Or if she do not, will be counted an Ass,
To the sweet tune of Samuel Rosye, or the Kings Clown.
JOan Towser, am I called,
And I love lusty Robin:
Though he be rough
He Is sure enough,
And flouts as well as Scogin.
But if he does not please me,
And comes not at my calling,
With Tom or Dick,
I will not stick
To wrestle for a falling.
And if they fall upon me,
Although that I lie under,
'Ile kick and fling
Like any thing,
Shall make them both to wonder.
If Doll or Kate will tarry
Be coy, and yet stay longer,
'Ile not be sick,
But play the trick,
I never shall do it younger.
For if that I should tarry,
Until my Father wedd me:
I should loose ten
Good Husbandmen,
Who sooner would behead me.
This six months have I longed,
Now 'lle be mine own carver:
For one poor man
Do what he can,
Will only be my starver.
But I have been so ruffl'd
I find my belly swelling,
In London Town
I Will lay it down,
Where I will take my dwelling.
The Carryer came up with me
A well trust, lusty Roger,
(...) broad 'ith Back
As any Pack,
'Im sure he was no dodger.
He used me then so kindly,
And called me his dear honey,
But I know not,
What ere he got,
'Im sure he got no money:
Now I am at my Lodging,
To entertain a Prentice,
And he shall pay
For Robin's play;
His Masters cash my rent is.
But when their cash does fail me,
Then I am for your gallant;
A Redcoat Knight
Is my delight,
For to improve my Talent.
Next I my case will open,
A man of Law shall plead it;
Though he were blind,
He Will surely find
The way for him to read it.
Then to the City Lectures
With Bible tread demurely,
My rolling eyes
And holy lies,
Will get a Brother surely.
Next, some good Able-Teacher,
My Scruple must resolve me,
For he is the man
Who will and can
Abundantly absolve me.
My Half-crown at a Playhouse,
Young Heirs and Lords sit by me,
With China-fruits,
Commence their suits,
Like VVater-men they ply me.
But when the play is ended,
And each man hopes a favor;
My Coach is gone,
But here is one
My Lord says, Now I have her.
The Streets I walk at Twilight,
And justle, if I like him,
Then pardon ask,
Pull of my Mask,
It Is ten to one I strike him.
Sometimes I shrink as fearful,
When any man comes nigh me,
Let fall my Glove,
And then my Love
Will take it up and try me.
How happy this Encounter,
Replies my civil Cully,
And this fair hand
Shall now be manned,
Sothus I catch my Bully.
But not unto my lodging,
I dare not for my Mother,
Or have an Aunt,
Will give and grant,
A sister or a brother.
Yet I will give a meeting,
But you shall promise further,
No other force,
But your discourse,
Or I will cry out murder.
And thus my Nets are spreading,
To catch my Woodcocks flying:
Yet seem as coy
As any Boy,
And am as often crying.
Then I complain my fortune
How I did first miscarry:
A friend untrue,
Did me pursue,
Who promised me to marry.
But he came up to London,
I followed my false lover;
To Sea he is gone,
Or lives unknown,
Where I cannot discover.
For Chamber-rent inbted;
And on the score for feeding,
Till money come
To me from home;
Where I have had good breeding.
But if some friend that is noble*
Would free me from this trouble,
Then by this kiss,
I will be his;
And thus I blow my bubble.
Some puny Toasts I wheedle,
With such like brittle stories,
But find much more,
Who call me whore,
And kick to Rutt like Tories.
Though I get store of money,
The Devils in my trading,
When Pimp and Baud,
And Bravo's paid,
I must take in fresh lading.
And now in Covent Garden
I lodge, a wife forsaken
A Cavalier;
My Husband dear,
By Pirates lately taken.
This place I cannot rest in,
Young Rogues are grown so cunning,
I shall be smoaked,
And soon uncloaked,
Therefore I must be running.
Now I Will pass for a widow,
My waiter and my woman,
In duty they,
So rich must say,
At least I Am for a Yeoman.
And I have many Suitors,
With treats and presents striving;
But must be gone,
They Will find anon,
I am unfit for wiving.
I water make for faces,
And have learnt to cut patches;
But that is a trade,
As much decayed,
As that of selling Matches.
I Will back into the Country,
And show them my good breeding,
No, it is too late
'Im out of date,
I shall not get my feeding.
Then have amongst the lasses,
Who will if you be willing,
In wheatstones Park,
Give you a mark,
Cost more then forty shillings.
Now you know where to find me,
At school with Mother Con^y;
Then have at all,
Both great and small,
For love or else for money.
The Perspective of Mortality.
HOw vain are all our best delights;
Like shortest days to Winters-nights
Scarce well awake, till our lives-noon
A sickly light, and day is done,
Most wretched mankind, seeming free,
Has less (then Creatures) liberty;
Help-less, and crying, brought to light
Nursed up in hazards, Parents fright,
Taught to be pleased with toys, and then
Forbid delights, when we are men;
Then war, or sickness, want, or trouble,
Blown up with sin, does break the bubble.
To a Detraction from the Author.
THough I be no Logician,
Nor yet good Naturalist,
Nor seen the strange American
Whom the near Sun has kissed:
I may be honest, modest, free,
And charitable too,
Obedient to God may be,
What have I more to do?
Desire of knowledge led the way,
Sin followed swiftly on,
Both Learned and Ignorant astray
Have led Religion:
Best knowledge by Humility,
Is taught in wisdoms School;
All other new Philosophy
Makes wisemen play the fool.
Upon the Fatal years of 1665 and 1666.
WHat Fate averse, does Damon guide
To breath an age of Prodigies,
Kings have no Subjects, who are tied
By any Rule, but Vanities,
Law, nor Religion, thought good,
Not first Baptized, in humane blood.
Incorrigible Race of Worms,
Whom neither Plague, nor War can win,
Nor fruitful peace, but in new forms,
Call virtue vice, and vice no sin;
'Twere better to believe in lies,
Then to confess, and truth despise.
In this last Age, of wonders sent
The will of Heaven to declare;
We will not see, but wilful bent,
Say bold, and wisemen, do not fear
Times-past, the like has seen, or more
Variety, is natures store.
Thus sensually we dispute,
Against the light of blessed truth,
Till deaths strong Arguments confute
The Follies of our Age and Youth,
And Nature then resolves the doubt
That we were in, when we were out.
To the Authors wife, in time of the Sickness, when he was beyond the Seat.
HOw happy had thou Reymund been
When washed from guilt Original,
And clear from any mortal sin,
If then had been thy Funeral,
But now (alas) afraid to die,
Because thy Clara, is not by.
Almighty Power, whose Providence
Supports my seeble house of Clay,
Do not remove, my Clara hence
But give us both a longer day,
That both together, we may praise
Our Lord of life, our length of days.
I know thou know, Great God above,
Her heart does to thy worship bow,
Yet She to me, thou gav'st to Love,
By holy Sacramental vow;
Do not Shut up, our day so soon,
For yet (O Lord) it is but noon.
Remember now, thy promised aid,
Though thousands fall on every hand,
I will not therefore be afraid,
The Angels are at thy Command:
Protect her Lord, and so bless me,
We may together, ever be.
POEM.
Afflictions plough the Heart of man,
Fits it for wisdoms seed,
Then Grace brings forth her blessed increase
Whereon the soul does feed.
We must be broken e're made strait,
And wounded to be cured;
Who would not suffer little pain
To have his health assured?
Crosses and dangers which are past,
With pleasure we repeat,
The Psalmist never sung so sweet,
As in a Shepherds seat.
Physic displeasing to the taste
Nature assists, to health,
How comes it then, we do not wish
For loss producing wealth.
Miser-mankind, who will not give
One penny from his heap,
Accursed thrist, to loose a life
So dear, and saved so cheap.
Wound me, O Lord, and make me whole,
Bind men, and set me free,
Nay, kill men, so I then may live,
And die to All but thee.
An Elegy on Mistress Anne Leonard, daughter to Sir Moulton Lambert.
DEad is the mirror of her Sex, the Stem
Of a fair spreading Cedar, natures Gem,
Whose Gnossian Crown, presents her aged Sire
A brighter Star, then Ariadnes fire;
Alas, dear Parents, would I could expres;
Her virtues more, to make your sufferings less:
She Is gone before, your places to prepare,
The Child provides to ease the parents care:
Rare Hierogliphick of a Saint, by death
In her they learn to live, who gave her breath,
Earth's seeming joys she leaves, and the worlds glory
Flies, and forgets, for a Memento Mori.
Poor worldless-world, thy longest joys afford
As short a span of pleasure, as the gourd
Which Jonas had, it is time thou now return
To Chaos, or as tribute to her Urn
Pay thine own ashes, and Erect a toomb
That may out live Mausolus, leave no room
'Twixt Pyramid and Sky, whence Angels shall
Descend to Celebrate her Festival;
And her Harmonious voice instruct to Sing
Loud Hallelujahs, to great Salems King
In holy Quire, whose joy is to behold
A Lions Lamb recovered to the Fold.
Alluding to the names of Leonard and Lambert.
ANd now her Angel Soul, in Heaven has place
With Judah's Lion, and the Lamb of Grace.
Dead is my Dear, a dream is my desire,
And yet my flesh, in hope, shall here respre.
In super and Caro meu requiescit in Spe.
ESSAYS.
TO do well, is a Princely thing,
Though some do speak it Ill,
Rash Judges, will condemn a King
To gratify their will.
The' advantage of a Noble mind
In difficulties shows,
Higher it raises them we find,
Less active overthrows.
Her that will raise a building high
Magnificent to show,
Must first look downward with his eye,
and build as deep below.
Sometimes a heart disposed well,
Within the brain does breed,
Right understanding to do well,
The fruit is like the seed.
But all who names of men do bear,
Are not so to be thought;
Unless at helm, does reason steer
In Laws of virture taught.
The strong, the fierce, bold, stout, and tall,
The hardy, wise, and fair,
Rich, highly born, renowned withal
Are Epithetes of Air.
whom reason rules not, beasts must be
Abusing so, their own degree.
The Cause of Paganism at first in the world.
NAture corrupt, and knowledge blind
By Adams fall, those sparks and seeds
Of heavenly light, yet left behind
Appearing then, broke forth in weeds.
For wanting grace, and power, to grow
To first perfection, did decline
To superstition, and so
Worship to creatures did assign.
Man's fearful mind, strange gods did make,
Which Custom, with the power of Hell,
Such root in all mankind did take,
That worst of Ills, they deemed well.
Some Worshipped Devils, some men's Ghosts,
And others bowed to Fowl and Fish,
To Herbs, and bones, and Painted-poasts,
They knew not what themselves would wish.
The Planets, Fire, the Air, and Sea,
And every running Brook beside,
No Virtue, nor no Vice; but they
Had with false Worship them belied.
Some God or Goddess was assigned
To all of these; Oh! wretched men
Whose stubborn wills to sin inclined
God suffered fall, but raised again.
Such mercies may we ever find
To worship that eternal light,
Who raised the dead, and cured the blind,
And saved from everlasting night.
Upon a wise saying of Marcus Auralius Antoninus.
A Heathen Emperor does teach
What Christians ought to do,
Nature corrupt, to us does preach,
And gives example too.
The time of man's life's as a point,
The substance ever flows,
The sense obscure, does disappoint
Him, when he thinks he knows.
Our bodies whole composure tends
To base coruption,
Our souls are restless till our ends,
Then none knows whither gone.
Fortunes uncertain, doubtfulfame,
And a s stream that is past;
Things of our bodies and our name,
Blank Lots have drawn at last.
And as a dream, or Smoke are things
belonging to the Soul,
They pass away like sounds of strings,
Or flights of swiftest fowl.
Our life's a pilgrimage, or war,
And fame when life is done,
In little time's forgot so far,
That it is Oblivion.
One thing remains Philosophy,
Consisting in this act;
Thy Spirit keep from injury,
Or Contumolious fact.
Above all pains and pleasures too,
Do nothing rash or feigned,
Nor over-critically do,
So keep thy mind unstained.
From thine own actions depend,
Embracing with content
What ever comes, which he does send,
Whence thou art also sent.
'Bove all things, death with cheerfulness
Expect, since it is no more
But Elements resolvedness,
To what they were before.
This dissolution to all,
So common do not shun,
Nature bespeaks thy Funeral,
Which creep not to, but runn.
No ill in nature it is to dye,
To nature it is accordingly;
ESSAY.
The ignorant and wilful worldings say,
As he who bid good morning to the day,
Next to his Gold, and that is esteemed best,
Which is most profitable 'bove the rest;
If they mean profitable to a man
As he is rational, then I can
With them agree, but as a creature then
I them reject, as bad and senceless men.
Let nothing cause thee, violate thy faith,
Immov'd by flattery what any says.
Loose not thy modesty, nor hate nor curse,
Dissemble not, an Hypocrite is worse.
What ere requires, the secrecy of walls,
Lust not thou after, nor the white of vayles.
Thy rational part, and Spirit keep,
The Sacred mysteries of virtues deep
Within thy heart; how happy then is he,
Wants neither solitude nor company?
Neither laments, exclaims, nor sighs in vain,
But lives without desire, or fear, or pain:
For life or death, he is indifferent,
Who neither seeks nor shuns, but takes what is, sent.
Upon the Proverb.
HE that considers wind and rain,
Shall neither sow nor reap;
This proverb sure was made for Spain,
Where gravity is cheap.
Nothing shall discompose his gate,
His beads and box perfumed:
Though Hay lestones fall upon his pate,
His hat of is presumed.
Yet he this Proverb so does cross,
For all he does is so,
Though he does suffer any loss,
He always answers no.
The Sun and Earth, were made you know
For him, and fertile South,
It Is base, to reap or stoop so low,
The fruit falls in his mouth.
For every action there is yet
A fitting season when,
It Is time to speak, or silent sit,
Where prudence governs men.
A time may be, when as the words
Of poor and simple wights,
May profit more than all the Swords
U'sd in the strongest sights.
That City truly found it so,
Which the poor man did save,
As in the Proverbs said to do,
By The counsel which he gave.
The Power of wise and Eloquent,
'Th'out opportunity,
Is nothing but our labor spent,
As charms to Adders be.
Upon the Rebel Moors in Africa, now Mahometans.
HOw happy were thou Africa,
By holy Saints inhabited,
When Augustine and Monicha,
Did teach to thee Christ Crucifide.
A Catalogue of Martyrs there,
Displayed the Banner of the Cross,
And ledd the way, that without fear,
Ye might by death sustain no loss.
One drop of blood, for Jesus spent
Enricheth more your fertile soil,
Then all those Rains, by Clouds are sent,
With all your labor and your toil;
Ye blind, where such antiquity
Are extant, spread all over your Land,
Yet will not see your vanities,
Nor truth from falsehood understand.
Had you not seen and then believed
Your crime now infidelity,
Had been the less, but since received
Damnation for Apostasy.
Against God and King your lusts rebel,
Repent, and turn unto the cross,
That Paradise you seek is Hell,
Which found too soon, too late your loss.
A Description of the Ages of man's life, and their Inclinations and defects.
INfants desiring hurtful things
Have bodies innocent;
But it is their mind from whence it springs,
Makes ill their weak intent.
They should to virtue so be bred
In their most tender age,
They need not know if nature did,
Or precepts them engage.
But let the rules of virtue be
Insinuated so,
'Thout trouble or severity,
To take delight to know:
What e're they follow taught with fear,
Their hate conceived then,
Will after, in their age appear,
And loath when they are men.
Allow them harmless wantonness,
And Learning so infuse;
Rather as change, then playing less
Or burdened by their Muse.
Fear does consume that moisture quite
Which nature does intend
To spread their limbs, and grow upright;
Which failing, hasts their end.
Some natures soft molded for love
And for humanity,
First apprehension does moove
Of grief to make them cry.
Others though beaten, shed no tear;,
Of natures harsh, and fierce,
Th'out true affection, or just fears,
But stubborn and perverse.
Things of no judgment, little pain,
They suddenly take in
As language, easily they gain,
Often keeping what they win.
Rewards of virtue next propose,
And praise of doing well,
The shame and infamy of those,
Where vice is known to dwell.
Not to fear virtue, as she were
To harsh to' be enjoyed
Who tastes the sweetness she does bear,
Can never be ore-cloy'd.
Thus whilst untroubl'd, or allured
With vice of Flattery,
And from ambition secured:
To judge and know not why.
Still unexperienced by age,
Incapable of pleasure,
What friends do like, or do engage:
by them take up their measure.
Soon as their minds have sense of praise,
then kindle their desire,
To affect honorable ways,
By glory set on fire.
In exercise to labor more
Their equals to excel,
Then ever yet, they did before
To please by doing well.
A hott young man, with soul as high,
Youths freedom laid aside,
May well take up so moderately,
To sit by wisdoms side.
He who in youth begins to show
Mature and sober mind,
Will languish with a dullness so;
Not old, and yet declined.
But he, who amongst his great delights,
Loves one with eagerness,
And follows it with appetites,
Which death can but depress.
Declares he is able to maintain
Those studyes he affects,
With labor, industry and pain,
And virtue he effects.
No disposition but this,
Can truly find the way
To glory here, or future bliss,
But he will go astray.
Now middle age, and distant so,
From giddiness of youth,
Not burden of old age to know,
Should tell us all the truth.
But they great seekers are of wealth
And honor, cunning to
Dissembling friendships, and by stealth
Do what they will not know.
Their passions they govern so
As if that they had none;
Then valiant, if ever too,
And then most truly shown.
That heat of courage moderate
But not extinguished
Which rashly carries youth to fate
To number with the dead.
Fear the Companion of age
Disturbs the minds desires
And want of heat, does much assuage,
What fortitude inspires.
Though otherwise it is a seat,
For wisdom to remain,
But then the mind does want that heat,
Which courage should sustain.
Through many dangers of their own
And those of others seen;
Ruined, which they escaped alone
They now would pass between.
It Is mockery of all mankind
That age, to avarice
Should most of all, be then inclined
When death has thrown the Dice.
And nature weak (to help her self)
Least able, then to strive
To hoord up treasures of pelf
To keep the dead alive.
This counsel, age may better take
That young men they excuse,
For errors all of us do make
But age the least should choose.
Suffer their innocent delights
Hear them with gentleness.
And sometimes, though not in the right
accept with pleasingness.
In thine old age, if thou expect
Obsequiousness to thee,
'T approve thy words without neglect
Use this Equality.
And seem at least, if not consent
To please them when you may,
In things which are indifferent
Then speak and they will obey.
And suffer thee to tell thy tale
And storys of thy youth
Uninterrupted, though thou fayl
In telling of the truth.
A SONG.
To the Tune of, Since Fortune thou art so kind.
SInce Cupid thou art grown so kind
To give to me my choice of mind
Of Beautys store,
First I require, that she be
Both proud and coy to all but me,
I ask no more.
As wonton, jolly, blithe with me,
As amarous wives new married be,
And then a care,
To look and kiss, with so much art
As I may plainly taste her heart,
And that is my fare.
Let other Lovers all be pyn'd
First from her scorn, then their own mind.
Oh then I Am seated
In Lovers-heaven, where I am fixed
In single glory that is unmixt
When they are defeated.
Where beauty's able to give laws
Thus to her self, thus to her cause,
I must employ,
My self to obey her noble power
Every minute, every hour,
In this I joy.
Bus since thou art in sits of kindness
I prithee Child resign thy blindness,
And then I Am sure
Thou will not hit by chance but choice,
For which thou have each Lovers voice,
And that is their cure.
But if thou will thy power employ,
Thy cruel art, hearts to destroy,
For hearts are thine,
If she refuse mine, lay't not by her,
Sooner throw't into thy fire
For to calci^e,
The Phaenix from her cinders grows
And true love from loves ashes flows,
Oh how I burn;
So the condition of my fate
'Twixt life and death to circulate,
In Cupids Urne.
I Will have as many hearts for thee
As in those ashes grains you will see,
And then I Am sure
I Will have one heart to sacrifice,
To every look of her fair eyes,
And that is my cure.
These to my Mistress I present,
As this days tribute to her sent;
It Is my desire:
To be her Martyr is my glory
And be written in loves story
Penned with fire.
A jealous Lady reproaching her Servant that he courted new Faces, since her
own, not the best, yet she was well proportioned, thus answers.
WHither Art or natures grace
Does adorn my mistress face,
Burns nor quenches my desire,
They are those parts obscured from sight,
Limbs proportioned for delight;
Blows my warmth into a fire:
If a face could please alone
One pictured, or would cut in stone.
From a Person in love with a young Lady who had married an old Man.
BRuno entreats Albana tell,
How Bruno she inclines to love,
Whose heart is proof against a spell,
Yet from her circle cannot move.
It Is not I find the power of arts,
Not any charm can conquer me;
It must be sympathy in hearts,
Or if not so, what can it be?
Discords in Music we do find
Such harmony, and air does bring
Such charming sweetness to the mind,
As if the close were all one string.
The emitted Atoms through our eyes
Secret intelligence conveigs,
Into our hearts, which no disguise
Can hide from such elucent rays.
Love much abused, where interest
Usurpes that name and proper right,
That Is only due to such a breast
Which loves the person at first sight.
And that magnetique sympathy
Which does incline our eyes to gaze,
Is the souls choice and amity,
Loves circulation in a maze.
If any other hidden cause
Or more elate, pray let me know;
For if you take a time to pause,
You Will but invent to hide it so.
Truly confess and freely say,
It is the same what ere it be
Which makes you love and go that way,
You cannot choose but meet with me.
How well agreed, how understood
Our hearts to one another known,
The secret tie is in our blood,
The Seed is in our natures sown.
The works of nature hidden are
Which by effects we only know,
Then against nature we make war
When we not imitate her so.
Let no delusive Fantosme then
Misleade us with fantastique fire,
Women were only made for men,
Which nature prompts us to desire.
Old Age's a moving monument,
Their marbles sweat but cold as Ice,
But quickening natures first intent
Gets monuments of greater price.
Nature with reason does agree,
No incoherence can we find,
But that impelled by sympathy,
By nature married, must be kind.
Has nature yet by any law
Or rule, confined one creature yet;
Then surely nature to obey
Is only rational and fit.
Rebels to nature may create
New forms of government I know,
And turn a Kingdom to a state,
But my Albana does not so.
For she loves Monarchy as I,
And I love her, because she loves
She cannot live and bid me dye,
For doing what her self approves.
A Catch made before the KINGS coming to Worcester with the Scottish Army.
THe Roundheads drink a health
To their new Commonwealth,
And swear the Kings must be forgot;
But the pot shall be banged
When the Rogues are all hanged
Here Is a Health to the King and the Scot.
Come Skinker be nimble,
This quart's but a thimble,
Away with it, swell this of a gallon;
To our Masters brave Son
Who will fire the first gun
And boldly command us, fall on.
Each man upon his back,
Shall swallow his Sack,
This health will endure no shrinking;
The rest shall dance round,
Him that lies on the ground
Before me, this is excellent drinking.
Faith Ladds let us uncase us,
Our rags but disgrace us,
Some faggots, more, wine and a health
To him and all those
Who will fire their clothes
As I would this new Commonwealth.
A SONG.
To the Tune of My Dear and only Love take heed.
TEach me Bellisa what to do
I am Environed round,
Grief bringing thoughts, oppress me so
They bend me to the ground;
Alas, thy Strephon does implore
Thy help in time of need,
He beggs who never begged before,
Come save my life w'th speed.
Could I but hear thy sweetest voice,
Or bless miue eyes with thine,
My panting heart would so rejoice
Souls so with bodies join
As frosts before the sun does melt,
And rivers glide away
My griefs would pass by me unfelt
With thee if I might stay.
And I more faithful than the rest
Who for thy favor sue,
Should be imbosom'd in thy breast
The place to my love due;
Then happy Strephon joyful sing,
Have hence away my sorrow;
I Would not change states with any King.
To be a King tomorrow.
A Shepherd true, a faithful friend,
I Will ever prove to thee;
The skies to earth, shall first descend,
E're thou complain of me:
Then lay aside thy withered fear,
And feed on hopes a while;
Fair weather after storms appear,
Love shall the time beguil.
SONG.
CUpid is an idle toy,
Never was there such a boy;
If there were, let any show,
Or his quiver, or his bow,
Or the wound by him he got
By a broken arrow shot.
Money, Money, Money makes men bow;
That Is the only Cupid now.
Whilst the world continued good,
And men loved for flesh and blood;
Men about them wore a dart
Which did win a woman's heart;
And the women great and small,
With a certain thing they call
Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me, caught the men,
That was the only Cupid then.
A Song on a Scornful Mistress.
Drowsy Lover rowse thy soul,
Quaffe Canary, and thou wilt find
Spirits floating in the bowl,
Cures distempers of the mind:
Drinking makes thee sleep secure,
That alone is half a cure.
If Bellara be too cold,
And have chilled thy loves desire,
Drink, it is warming, and be bold,
She has no such active fire:
Each glass a fresh Mistress brings
Our Seraglio's great as Kings.
When thou art thus careless grown,
And thy ague fit removed,
Women will not loose their own;
Where they ever were beloved.
Then if she will return to thee,
Nothing cures so well as she.
AN EPIGRAM On two at Enmity with one another.
DIego is speechless, cannot live,
How poor Reymundo then will grieve;
But how if Diego should recover,
Poor Reymund then will n'ere give over,
Neither without, nor with at ease
The Devil take him if he please.
To the same accusing him for Flattery.
HOw happy is that Government
Where Flattery meets punishment,
How fatal where it finds reward,
And treason to have Honors guard.
Leave off ye Flatterers for shame,
For honest duty fears no blame.
A CATCH,
To the Tune of, Old Poets Hipocrene Admire.
COme Tom let us drink a rowsing glass,
Ud's niggs never stir, is but an Ass,
Good drinking brings all things to pass:
Come Harry, George, and Jack take part,
And much good do it each man's heart,
Who will not drink's not worth a fart.
Each man his glass and bottle by,
Tobacco, Pipe, Artillery,
A frolic, catch, and Drollery;
We Will have no tell-tale boys to fill,
Under the Rose no man speaks ill,
But's safe as Thief is in a Mill.
I love the King and Royal blood,
Will fight their cause not understood,
And for their sakes would drink a flood;
Yet to their health's I not incline,
But here is to those who will drink wine,
Sack and a friend are both divine.
Faith one glass more, and then let us go,
Health to the lass, who never said no,
Or if she did, would take it too;
Since only they do make us sport
In City, Country, Camp, and Court,
Let him be hanged, who cares not for it.
Another to the same Tune.
It Is much
The Dutch
Dares drink or fight
Since they
Must say
To do us right
The English Drunkards have more might,
For when we fight or drink their Mumm,
So soundly we their jackets humm
You cannot wake them with a drumm.
We still
Cry fill
More Wine advance
Such men
Again
Will conquer France,
And Tech them de fin* running dance,
Leaving their grapes for us to squeeze,
Till they submit with Je-vou-prie's,
But let the Dons take snuch and sneeze.
It Is late
We prate
And loose much time,
The Sun
Is run
Unto a Clime
Which dully drinks without a Rhyme;
Then foot to foot, let us drink at those
And Dutch-like drown those An-ti-toes,
Then call the Sun to drink his dose.
Another to the same Tune.
FOr Wine
That Is fine
We hither come,
Draw neat
No cheat
Nor poisoned stumme,
But Sack that speaks; when we are dumb;
No other noise do we desire,
But boy draw wine and make a fire,
A Catch is then, your only Quire.
Faith ladd
I Am gladd
To see thee here,
It Is sack
We lack
Our wits to cheer;
Twill make us equal, with a Peer:
It Is music when the boy cries score
And clinks the pots, when we call more,
As drunken Greeks did heretofore.
Come George
My gorge
Begins to warm,
Repeat
This heat
'Twill do no harm;
Your Treason-Brewers, drink in barme,
Begin a health to our dear Miss,
And unto him, who she dares kiss,
For all the rest we care not this.
Now Tom
Is come
And he shall pledge,
This glass
Shall pass,
Now we are fledge,
Though drunk as beggars under hedge:
And he who will not sing and chat,
Cry tope, and throw aside his hat,
Not company is for a Cat.
To a fair great-bellyed Lady come to lie In in London.
SHe comes like full-ear'd harvest now,
Or fruit that loads the yielding bow,
Which the glad Husbandman invites
To taste, and labor new delights;
Just so (a ship with some rich trade)
Having a happy voyage made,
In some safe harbor she unloads,
Her owners treasure, and her goods;
His friends rejoice, he freed from fear,
Puts forth again another year;
Now welcome Miss, you are imbay'd,
And must your Treasure here unlade;
A ship well fraught, a ground well sown,
No doubt will yield us still our own,
You shall be manned and victual'd too,
For a deal more you have yet to do;
But when you have increased our store,
To travail then you shall no more,
But safely sit and see your wealth,
Though honest got, yet got by stealth.
To an absent Friend.
AS streams do circulating creep,
Through empty veins of th'immov'd earth,
Till to their Mother in the deep,
They pay the tribute of their birth:
So circularly we do move,
Impelled by sympathy to meet,
Our hearts are centrical in Love,
At distance we incline and greet.
A Tyrant shackles may put on,
But cannot blind our inward light,
No Cave so much obscured from sun,
That on our souls can force a night.
Love is our light, give me a friend
Whose breast transparent is to me;
Eternal beings have no end,
My friendship would be that to thee.
What fortune it is keeps us asunder,
Is both my trouble and my wonder.
To friends in the Country, who kept Leut, dwelling near a Forest of the Kings.
To the Tune of, Chevy Chase.
Ye wights which on the Forest fringe,
The Kings dear Dear disturb,
Find out a tree, I Will find you sprindge,
Which can wild horses curb:
Say farewell Oysters, and old Ling,
Pease-pottage, eke and gruel,
My self your Epitaphs will sing,
That trees should bear such fuel.
A Catch.
THe poor abused Bagg-piper,
Came home some two days after,
With a full intent, for to beget
On his Wife, a Son or a Daughter;
But she being acquainted before
With Soldiers and other Captains,
Got the running of the reins,
So he was well paid for his peins.
Pastoral Song complaining of falsehood.
DA^on the Shepherd with the flock,
Of wanton Kidds safely browsing
Under the shelter of a Rock,
Where wone the herd to come A-bowsing
Unto a bibling stream that ran,
There Damon sat, and thus began,
Cruel, Cruel, inconstant woman,
False unto me, and true to no man.
When as another Swain you saw,
Yon liking loved, or loving fained,
Then 'gan from me your love withdraw,
Too soon alas he had obtained:
Then came a third your love to winn,
And we were out and he was in:
Farewell, Farewell, Inconstant woman,
False unto me, and true to no man.
To the Tune of, A Scotch Ditie
Farewell false fair one,
I can no more abide,
To live and love alone,
And still to be denied.
Since I now have found thy changing,
That thou love to be beloved,
Go hence alone'a ranging,
From me that am immov'd.

On a Lady standing on a River-bank, seeing her shadow in the water.
SAy fairest Nymph, what would thou see,
Another world enriched by thee,
Is It not enough, the Gods have given thee more
Of awful beauty, and of charming grace,
Then ere was yet in any Face;
But thou will set those Elements at odds,
First reconciled by the Gods.
The liquid Nymphs came gliding by
To wonder, and to deifie,
Raising their seidgy heads to gaze, did bow,
Since they had never seen amongst the train
Of Huntresses, the like again,
Then diving to their watery Caves below,
Asked of their gods, what they did know.
The angry Queen of love did weep,
To see her Copy in the deep,
Mounting her Dove-drawn-chariot, hasts on high,
What Mortal, says she, Father, have thou made?
That Heaven and Earth does thus invade.
Since all mankind about, where she does dwell,
Adotes not us, but her poor Cell.
Then mildly Jove, do not despise
The likeness of thine own bright eyes,
She worships us and is thy subject sworn,
For though thy Son could never find a dart,
To wound her, it is a yielded heart;
And on that bank, she came to shed some tears
Of Love and kindness mixed with fears.
Subscription to a Letter in verse.
EVil to the Evil thinker,
And good wine to the fair drinker,
The merry witty, full of glee,
Are only company for me:
Where ere I find a narrow friend,
I leave him to his foolish end.
On a Scornful and Censorious Lady.
FIctitious beauties, who presume,
Men's words, which vented are as Rheum,
Are sires, and for your sakes consume,
Know it is self-love, which you deceives,
And the false Optics true believes
Like Hocus-cheats, in their own sleeves.
When your mock-Majesties, we court,
As boys a ssault a paper fort,
It Is not for glory, but for sport;
So when we praise a colored face,
Such an uncomely* comely-grace,
It Is not for quarry but for chase.
Do You think that man, created Master,
Ought not to be his own Taster,
And call yee-comming, to come faster;
If Sovereign man his vassal pledge,
Commands to bed, to barn, or hedge,
Ye are the blocks, but he the wedge.
Then wretched women know your scorn
Is treason against your Lord first born,
Ye are but weeds that grow in the corn;
And when together ye are bound,
No other seed from you is found,
But what we bring to our own ground.
The Papist cannot take one oath,
The Puritan will swallow both,
It Is drawing of a hollow tooth:
Which no body can deny.
The Papists swears he served the King,
The Puritan says the same thing,
Swears Capons better much then Ling:
Which no body can deny.
Some say the Papist had a Plot,
To burn the Thames; Why was it not:
It was discovered by a Scot:
Which no body can deny.
A Song set by Mr. Hill.
I Am no subject unto Fate,
That power assumed I give to you,
Whither returning love or hate
Which falls in storms or gentle dew.
It is my will which chooses you,
Though Tyrant, yet if i will obey,
Obedience is truly due,
To whom I give my self away.
I may be born under a throne
(A slave or Free) without my voice,
But loving as Religion,
Solely depends on my own choice:
The worlds dimensions are wide,
My mind not Heaven can conf^ne,
That outside worship is belied
Which inward bows to other shrine.
Force may be called victory,
Yet only those are overcome,
Who yield unto an enemy
That is their certain fate and doom.
Thus fettered, I freely love,
My choice does make the conquest thine,
And 'Twill thy power best improve
That to thy subject thou incline.
Who wisely rules, deserves command,
Keep then the loyal next thy heart;
Elective Monarchs cannot stand,
Nor love without an equal dart.
A CATCH:

Upon Prince Rupert his intended voyage to Guiny.
GOds Sacrament he comes, no near
Might Devil hawl this Cavalier,
Giv't here some Brande-wine, make have,
Let Us skinke apace, 'twill be our last,
These sober English shalums fight,
It Is sport to them they take delight
To see a head shot off and roll,
Just as it were to throw a bowl,
And when the Scuppers run with blood,
They cry good cheer, for fish in the flood.
Hark how the hound-foots shout and cry,
See their Red crosses topmast high;
And where that Devil Rupert stands,
Who those fierce English dogs command:
See mine Heers, Howard, Stanly, Jarmin,
All to-mall about him swarming.
Saint George for England, now they call,
H'as killed of us the Devil and all.
Now they steer close and show a side,
The gates of Hell are not so wide;
Then lustick mates, another dramm,
And let the Devil fire his Damme:
Our bellys full, although we sink,
We shall the less salt water drink:
Now they spit fire at the Admiral,
They board and Ruyter he does fall;
And Rupert back to back makes twins,
Ten thousand Devil, break his shins.
Though Monck did thump us to our shoars,
He sinks us all like Sonns of Whores:
These English Carls will sink our state,
To offer monys now too late.
We Will make the Prince Van Orange King,
Coning Van France will no such thing
Submit, unto our Coning Spain,
Coning Van England rules the main.
Then cut our banks and drown our land,
Such foes, such Fates, who can withstand?
For if great York comes out to sea,
Our skins and country he will flea.
To my Lord Bellasyse then in Tangier.
I Am not poor, though wanting still,
Our poverty is in our will:

John Bellasyse Anagram. His Noble Sail.
TRue Anagram, His Noble Sail
Filled with the blasts of worthy Fame,
Ore Fortunes worst does now prevail,
And swells it to a noble name.
Through seas of blood, in civil wars
When the ship-Soveraign was lost,
This noble Sail with honored scarrs,
Bore up through all, though soundly tossed.
In all the storm, and darkest night
Which sew outlived, who did not yield,
This noble sail appeared in sight,
As if it self would keep the field.
Till the young Admiral was sound,
With whom the noble sail did close
To repossess, and keep that ground,
Which the Ship-Soveraign did loose.
Now Europe cannot fill this sail,
Those Rebel-winds are weaker-grown,
In Africa it finds a gale
To move against Rebellion.
This noble sail, let honor steer
Till crowned with victories,
From hence translated to a sphere
Where Honor and reward never dies.
John Bellasyse Anagram. Bees is all Honey.
BEES is all honey; Anagram
Affirms it is your Lordships name;
And I beleiv't, for Bellasyse
By it, is only named twice;
Rather explained, like mysteries,
Where such signification lies:
Such sweetness in the name and sense,
That speaking it is eloquence,
Bees (as your Lordship) have a King
And each (in their defense) a sting,
Industrious both, hating the Drone
Helpful to all, unhurt, hurts none,
The private and the common good
Is both your own and others food.
Alike it is to gather money,
For you my Lord, as Bees do honey.
On Sir Henry Bellasyse Son to my Lord John Bellasyse Anagram.
By her Seen Sally.
TO Sally is a Soldiers act,
To Conquer is to crown the fact;
And by a Mistress to be seen,
Might make a conquest on a Queen:
Who loves sure would be loved again,
He never fails who conquers men.
Great Alexander might at home
(Perhaps) some silly maid overcome,
But when he sallied forth in arms,
The world was taken by those Charms;
Riches and Honor, beauty, fame,
Are Captives to an honored name.
Let Henry Sally after John,
Then like the Father conquer Son.
To the Tune of Phillis though thy powerful Charms.
THy walls, O Tangier, soot and horse,
Thy sorts and line have little force,
It Is Bellasyse who thee defends,
Commuting all thy foes to friends,
His easy rule, and prudent care,
Shows peace much greater than the war,
Yet when he leads his men to fight,
His conduct's safe, as Eagles slight.
No more Alarums murmur now,
No man who wears a surrow'd brow,
Were it not order for to keep,
We Would open the gates and fall to sleep;
For Gayland knows his watch and word,
Secures this place more than the Sword;
And now with his Army does intend,
To show's he is a powerful friend.
Now happy Tangier is thy Fate
That Bellasyse is come, though late,
Thy worthies now in honours-bed,
Had not been numbered with the dead;
But 'twas not fit so great a prize
Tangier enjoyed and no man dies:
Some Roman Souls had here their grave,
Then why should we less hononr have.
But now the Laurel crowns his head,
Who solemnizes the brave dead,
And those remaining worthy men
Are subjects of his tongue and pen;
That our great Charles may know their worth,
And offer them he would set forth,
He certain is of a fair Fame,
Whom Bellasyse but once does name.
To the Tune of How happy and free is the Plunder.
Ye happy and free men of Tangier,
Who sear neither Moore, Dutch, nor danger,
Now our General's come,
Whose Trumpet and Drum
Makes Gayland appear like a stranger.
Then plow, sow and reap, make hay and drink wine,
The curtains are drawn, go to sleep in your line.
One Sentinel Africa saces,
Our stocks, and our herds abroad grazes,
The Dons bring us Sallads
To relish our pallats,
Which all but the fool much amaze^.
Then plow --
New works, and old walls are new mended,
The Soldier and sick are befriended,
The golden-age laws
Not ensnared by a clause,
With justice and honor defended,
Then plow
Who does not confess, we inherit
More then this from our Generals merit,
Will never be at ease,
Nor an Angel can please,
Let him hang with his own private spirit.
Then plow, sow and reap, make hay and drink wine,
The curtains are drawn, go to sleep in your line.
On two jealous Lovers.
STand, who comes there, it is I she said,
Of no man yet was e're afraid.
Then call your Corporal to me,
I have no more to speak to thee;
Corporal bring me to the place,
Where I your Colonel may face,
I have affairs of much import,
To none but him I will report.
Sir there is a woman waits at door,
Earnest to speak with you; No more,
Let her come in; your Servant Sir,
Madam what business makes you stir
So late abroad; The love of you
Since I have heard you are not true,
And my passion brings me here
That you my doubts and fears may clear.
I know not Madam what to say,
Nor who it is does me betray.
I wear your favors next my heart,
Nothing but death can make them part;
Then pray resolve me quickly, who
Has made this breach betwixt us too;
Were I as easy to believe,
I should have greatest cause to grieve:
You have of late declared I know,
In favor of a Rival foe;
Then I assirm'd under my hand,
Over me you never should command;
And yet I thought it was a blind,
And still to me were truly kind.
It Is true I am; yet have been told
You boast my savours and grow cold,
And other beautys-aid implore,
Forsaking mine to whom you swore:
If this be true, you cannot blame
Though I appeared to do the same;
But if that you put on this mask
To blind the world, I pardon ask,
I have done so, and would do still,
But cannot do it, without your will:
How quickly then are we agreed,
The wounds are healed but now did bleeds
No more false worships shall deceive
But one another we will believe.
On a censorious barren Lady to a Friend.
SOme there are George, who cluck and sit,
Not on their own, but others wit;
They spoil the good, the bad make worse;
And kill the child which they should nurse:
A windy egg, or one that is addle
Is good enough for fiddle faddle,
They may sit on, and keep a pother,
But never hatch to be a Mother.
On Mother Cony the Bawd.
WHen Mawd the Empress traivail'd France,
This Mother Cony learnt to dance,
She sooted it so finely then,
So loving was, so loved by men,
That falling backward by mishap,
A spruce young man fell in her lap;
So pleasing to her was this fall,
That dance she called Up-tails all;
And did this Jigg so often repeat,
It brought her to a mighty heat;
She was with sweats so gently cured,
That often the same she has endured;
With ease and oysters, now is grown,
Harder to be, then not be known;
A full days journey now about
Let him go see who makes the doubt.
To a Friend upon some Ladies who were curious to see the Authors Letters into
the Country, to condemn them.
I Am not sick, and yet take physic
Yet have no clappe, a cold, or ptysick,
That little which I have to spend's
For meat at home, as for the friends;
I have in town they are so few,
I stay at home to write to you,
And something more, though lesser reason
I balladize against women's treason;
For if I suffer undermining,
The Counter is defense, and lining,
They shall not come with their approaches,
And make a breach, to let in Coaches,
I Will sally forth and fire their trenches,
And drive them under Cabin benches,
Till they have lest their siege and quarrels
I Will make them creep into old barrels;
And then so roughly I will roll them,
Till they cry quarter and befowl them;
A Tyrant I, when once provoked,
Finding Devils Angel-cloak'd;
Amongst those black-birds now I leave them,
They deceive fools, feinds deceive them:
A friend, good wine, a little spending,
A pretty w^nch who needs no tending.
would have those who e're looks further,
On his own pleasures commits mu^ther,
And for one face, that is patcht and painted
Thousands are damned, for one that is sainted.
If Ale such Poetry affords,
What shall we do when drunk like Lords.
To a Spanish Lady in S. Lugar.
REymund thou have survived a war
Where thousands perished in thy sight,
And thou have travailed now so far
To yield thy self without a sight.
No more thy warfare ever boast,
Nor name thy self a Soldier now,
Since in that very port the art lost.
Where thou thy courage should a vow:
Thou know how ambushes are laid
How to avoid an Enemy,
The Ambush of a Spanish maid,
Has forced from thee thy liberty.
But Reymund with safe conduct came
And cannot be a prisoner,
It Is great Injustice, as great blame,
To circumvent a Travailer.
And yet alas I must confess
That I have broke your Countries law,
And by a Clandestine address,
Would carry hence* that maid away.
My Dear Lusya, it is a truth
Your Country has of Saints such store,
That I would glory in thy youth,
And in my Country thee adore;
But if Saint Lugar be the shrine
Where my devotion I must pay,
But promise me you will be mine
I Will make another Holy Day.
Upon the King and our Naval Enemies.
Arithmetic misplaced since Charles the second
In place before the fifth, should first be reckoned:
Old dotard time, and giddier-headed fame
Forgot the figure, yet memoriz'd the name,
What if the Danish, Swedish, Belgic coasters,
German, French, Spanish are pretending boasters,
Down with your topsails, Charles his sovereignty
Commands where Neptune has his Vice-gerency
Gyant-like Dutch, of a rebellious stock,
Forsaking your Protector split on a Rock:
Leave of ye daring Hogons, your pretending
Ye cannot fight; your boats and nets want mending.
TO your fishing trade again, and we your masters,
Will feed ye well, but still we must be tasters,
In this obedience to our Monarchy,
Eat Herrings, swallow your butter quietly.
Ten hundred thousand Sacraments cannot save ye,
Nor all those Tuns of Devils, ye would have, ye;
The crosier'd bloody flagge when we advance,
To them, and all the world, we give desiance:
For all who think by war our peace to trouble,
Shall find by wars abroad our peace redouble.
A Rhetorical speech of one Jobber an Atterneys Clerk of Davids-Inn, to his
Brother Squibbe fellow Clerk.
BRother Squibbe, be it known to all men by these presents, that I do utterly
quite, claim and demand, yielding and paying unto me the sum of nine pence
halfpenny, of lawful money of England, which I disbursed at sundry times upon
the purchase of several Mannours of Ginger-bread, what ever parcel or parcels,
I did occupy and enjoy, I take as quit Rents due upon the loan of my Money:
These are therefore to certify all whom it may concern, that I do lawfully
demand, my principal debt, for if I should run you through, and you should dye
wilfully in your own defense, it is but se defendo by the Law, for my mony's as
due to me, as your life is to you, besides you; ought not by the law to provoke
a man to his own destruction: yet out of my obligations to Law, in respect of
my present occasions, if you can procure me the just sum of three pence half
penny, and give me Bond for the rest, or procure Joan our kind Laundress to
pass her word, out of the singular good will and affection I have thereunto, I
will acquiese until the Term of Hillary.

Upon the Dutch Mutton-Mongers on the Coast of Suffolk, and other parts
pilfering of Turnips.
IS Meat so scarce amongst the Boors,
They set our sleets, and boats with oars,
To pilfer Mutton from our Coast,
And that the Victory they boast,
But sure they stayed too long to drink,
Which made so many of them sink,
We sent them Cooks to roast their meat,
And fyring too, fall to and eat;
We entertain such strangers so
Knowing how far they had to go,
And having had so warm a meal
They had no stomach, (more) to steal,
Unless to bed with all sayls made,
Whom we so civilly conveyed,
And yet they are not well content
But say 'twas too much complement,
Had Beaufort had but such atreat
He would have danced into a sweat,
And swore that English are the best
At entertaining foreign guest.
D^ll Dutch for shame, no more complain
For they will laugh at you in Spain,
Since here such welcome they have had
That still they think the English madd,
Would ye have yet a second course,
In troth I fear you will like it worse,
Unless our powdered dumplings please,
They Will fill your stomachs and give ease:
I know your drink is Brande-wine
But ye have worms and must drink brine,
Most of your stomachs are grown sick
And powdered meats are gross and thick.
We Will waft you back to English ground
And make your fulsome bodies sound,
For ye can never be at ease
Until ye* quite forsake the seas,
Pure air, spring water and brown-bread
Cures the distempers of your head;
At Chelsey College ye shall find
Physic as well to cure your mind,
State-surfers now are grown so strong
Ye must let blood under the Tongue;
Ye talk too much, and in those fits
Discover plots of your De-Witts,
But when ye are in perfect health,
We Will have a care too of your wealth;
Then back again, and tell your Mates:
What we have done to mend your states:
The Sea-toyl'd trade, and worlds affairs,
Leave it to us your lawful Heirs,
Then you good Fishermen may prove
In much obedience and love:
But if ye should relapse again
Ye cannot escape 'bove one in ten,
And the Grand Signior of France
About your Calenture will dance,
And in the height of your disease
Protect your Land, as we your Seas.
To Lottery of Love; To an old devout Tune.
WHo draws most blanks the most gets in,
Who ever loses most does win,
Who gets the most the most does loose,
Who least away a saver goes.
O love whose twisted Rope
No man could ere untie,
It makes us all to groape
Till we with groaping dye.
O love which makes a beast
Of Man that is highly born,
And then giv'st him a Crest
Much like a Bakers horn.
O Love whose Monkie-sport
Makes tumblers of us all,
Then giv'st us a Report
For chief of Fumblers-Hall.
At first we ride so fast,
We straight fall to a Trot,
Our bones so soar at last,
Can never be forgot.
O love whose mighty force
All creatnres does command,
For neither man nor horse
Could ever it with-stand.
It makes the Courtier frisks
To powder, cringe, and bow,
With Oleos and bisk
He treats the Lord knows how.
Although his body's weak
The power of love makes strong,
And when that he does speak
Eringo's on his Tongue.
The waiting-maid he courts
And into her does crawle,
That by those kind resorts,
He may her Lady mawl.
But Marchpane will not last
It melts so soon away,
And they behind are cast,
Like cheese-curds from the whay.
The Soldier in the field,
Who does the longest stand,
This love does make him yield,
His Pike falls out of's hand.
Yet when white Colors fly,
He does again advance,
And makes his foes to lie,
As they were in a trance.
Yet he is beaten so
He cannot keep his ground,
But sneakingly does go
To cure a pocky wound.
The Scholar does indite
Strong lines in verse or prose,
Till he does under-write
The Poet wants a Nose.
At first he slies so high,
At last does fall so low,
Such weakness from the thigh
Can neither stand nor go.
The merchant and the clown
Have all no better luck,
For they are up and down,
As Drakes are with a Duck.
With trading they do break,
With labor weakened, old,
Their ships do spring a leak
And then their tails are cold.
Fanatique Loves desire
That burns with sister zeal,
First London set on fire,
To make a Commonweal.
A pox on Venus whore,
And Cupid too, her son,
With all her daughters more
And so my Song is done.
Englands rejoicing for Londons Re-building.
To the Tune of Fair fall the Muses who in well tuned verse, or a joyful sight
to see.
LEt none pass by, who come this way,
Till they have heard me sing and say,
Who loves the King and Common good
Here Is cheerful news to warm his blood:
When London is re built again,
Then welcome all, both maids and men.
Come all good Citizens, rejoice with me,
For care recals no things are past,
A Phaenix from her ashes you shall see,
Of greater splendor, then the last.
Both rich and poor,
Will prosper more,
In one year than they did in three,
And all your trade,
So much decayed,
Shall flourish in a happy peace,
When all your jealousies shall cease,
A joyful sight to see.
Our Ancestors nere thought of such a Town
That all the world should it admire,
But low-built on the river-bank sat down,
In Hovels fit for naught but fire:
But our new Troy,
With fires of joy,
The fairest of the world shall be,
And all mankind,
Who are not blind,
Shall say that London is the Town
Of all the world, should wear the Crown,
A joyful sight to see.
No more by ally-smels, like midnight carts,
No holes where daylight never appears,
But ordered all in well proportion' dparts,
No place for jealousies and fears.
Nor foreign Clown,
Who comes to town,
Shall swear by all his ancestry,
That all that day,
He lost his way,
And yet Pauls-steeple could not find,
Mislead by turnings, like the blind;
A Joyful sight to see.
No more shop-lights built for necessity
Shall cause the Buyer to supect,
Good-fellows late may reel home quietly,
Without a trap-door to detect,
And not a bench,
For any wench,
To lay a child or get a Fee,
Nor Maids above,
With prentice love,
Ore tops of houses meet and kiss,
And spend the cash you do not miss,
A joyful sight to see.
Those Padders whom that City forest hid
And Plotters there their shelter found,
Your wise designed building does forbid,
No back-streets nor ways under ground,
But like good men
With heart and pen,
To public interest agree;
with arts and trade,
Ye all are made,
Then cheerfully to work amain,
It Is Englaads joy and all your gain,
A joyful sight to see.
New Churches with new bells, new tunes shall ring
The old are out of fashion now,
The Corporations in procession sing
Fanatiques too, the Lord knows how,
But one and all
Both great and small,
Come heartily and sing with me,
The King God bless,
The Queen no less,
Send them an Heir and happy Reign,
Our trade and liberties to maintain,
A joyful sight to see.
The Forest Lovers.
FAir maids who are so coy
In these Examples find,
All creatures will enjoy,
To one another kind.
Turn to your Lovers time will fly,
None love the old until they die.
Surely the Gods did preordaine
That we should meet this instant,
Here Is none but thou and I alone
Within this grove so pleasant;
Then sit thee down upon the grass
And I Will sit me down by thee,
There Is nothing here
Thou needst to fear,
Dearest do not deny me.
See how the strong and warlike Horse
The ground does beat so proudly,
And neighing to his Female love
The woods resounding loudly:
See how the wanton Kidd does frisk
Before her bearded Lover,
As she would say,
This time of day,
Invites to come and cover.
The lowing Kine, the lusty Bull
Calls over hedge and ditches,
Nature and reason does incline
Till age that does betwitch us:
A pair of years in love with thee,
All other loves refusing;
Then do not cry,
Nay pish nay fie,
For Love deferr'ds abusing.
The Turtle-Doves who areso chaste
See how they sit a billing,
See how the Ewe turns to the Ramm
Which shows all flesh is willing:
See how the Ivy clips the Elm,
And does with sloth upbraid us;
Then let us kiss,
It Is not amiss,
The trees on purpose shade us.
See how the pleasant Spring invites
Us to embrace each other,
See how the pretty birds delights
To chirpe at one another:
Then be not coy let us get a boy
And dearest deser't no longer,
And strive not now.
Unless that thou,
Do think to prove the stronger.
Who loves will not by force constrain
But gently win my favor,
So Satyrs do their lusts obtain
And care not then who have her,
But if I give my self to thee
And thou change for another;
Then not a Maid
I am afraid,
That I may prove a Mother.
Fear not thou dearest of my life,
My heart is thine for ever,
Before the Gods thou art my Wife
Now show thy love or never;
Delays are dangerous to love,
And age w^ll quickly seize us,
Lets now embrace
In this sweet place,
The birds will sing to please us.
I love too much she said, yet fear
But love is so much stronger,
Thou may do what thou will my Dear
I can hold out no longer:
But when thou have overcome my heart,
Dear leave me not to sorrow,
But tell me where
And truly swear,
To meet again to morrow.
The description of a rare beauty of a Lovers Fancy.
To an old Tune.
If any man do want a Wife,
And would secure her Honesty,
Take this, and then i will pawn my life
He shall be free from jealousy.
COme near my lusty Lovers,
Give ear unto my ditty,
A pleasant song
Is never long,
Supposing it be witty.
And list my noble Lasses,
My Song is of a creature,
Though not so fair
As others are,
Yet wonderful in feature.
Her short black frizled hair,
With Nitts for pearl adorned,
Two else-locks short
And some report,
Besides that she is horned.
Her pious ears down lossing
Do shade her mines of Amber,
Whence treacle drops
As fast as hopps,
Fall down to dress her Chamber.
A frozen dish-clout forehead
Which reaches to her Crown-a,
But if you will spy,
Her hole-bred eye
Then come a great way down-a.
That eye, so amorously
Does blink upon her lover,
Just like a sow,
Whose hayry brow,
Such sweet looks does discover.
Her nose much like a Parrets,
Or Romes greatest Commanders,
But such a smell
No tongue can tell,
If you come near her glanders.
Her cheeks are pleasant valleys
Which meet within her mouth-so
That you would think
'Twould stop the stink,
And turne't to her profecto.
Her bearded thin-lips powting,
As Fame her trumpet blows,
And her catarrhe
Proclaims a war,
Against her glaunders nose.
Her mouths a buttery hatch
Her swallow is so profound,
That you would think
When she does drink,
You were in the Danish sound,
Her tongue like spotted Ermins
And on each side a Canker,
Where such a breath
Is sudden death,
But come not near and think her.
Her teeth a Tinker hammered,
Out of a brewing kettle;
Her gumms as red
As our brown bread,
Or as the man of mettle.
Her chinn so complemental
Turns up to catch her drivel,
Who would not lie
In a Pigsty,
With such a Female Devil.
She Is neck'd much like a gander
Sweet voic'd as any bittern,
She sings in prose,
Like any rose,
Unto a barbers Cittern.
Her duggs like dried cows udder,
Her teats hang to her belly,
And all her milk
'As soft as silk,
But like Toad-tadder gelly.
Stand farther of I pray you,
Now I have spied Avernus,
Which we will pass by
Behind does lie,
A place will more concern us.
I cannot choose but tell you
A truth and it is a wonder,
Her cow'd-bon'd bumme
Sounds like a drumm,
And can as lowdly thunder.
Her thighs so much salt water
Does every day soak in,
She Is Fish below,
Down to her toe,
And looks like Haberdine.
If any lusty lover can
But like my Mistress favor,
Or Friend of mine,
I will resign,
And promise he shall have her.
Her parts so far exceeding
All other English beauties,
In writing this,
I have I wiss,
Performed a lovers duty.
The new mode of Love.
The whining lover seldom gets a prize
The bold and careless make the conquest sure,
When you come to look babies in their eyes,
They whistle you like Hawks unto a lure.
To an old Tune.
OF LOve whose power and might
None ever yet withstood,
Thou forcest me to write
Come turn about Robbin Hood.
Sole mistress of my rest
Let me thus far presume,
To make this bold request,
A black-patch for the Rheum.
Your tresses finely wrought
Much like a golden snare,
My silly heart has caught,
As Moss did catch his Mare.
Your eyes like stars divine
Makes me renew this arrant,
In simple speeches mine
A buttock for a warrant.
Oh women will you never,
But think that I do flatter,
I vow I loved her ever,
And fain I would be at her.
What is it I would not do
To purchase one good smile,
Bid me to China go
And i will sit still the while.
I think that I shall die
Love so my heart bewitches,
It makes me howl and cry,
Oh! how my elbow itches.
Te^^^ overflow my sight
With waves of daily weeping,
That in the careful night
I take no rest for sleepi^g.
Cupid is blind men say,
But yet me thinks he sees,
He hit me 'o-ther day
A T -- in Cupids teeth.
My Mistress is so fair,
But oh! her late disgraces,
Has made me to despair,
A pox take all such faces.
But since my simple merits
Her loving looks must lack,
Come stop my vital spirits,
With claret wine and sack.
Regard my great mishaps,
Oh Jove thou God of wonder,
Send down thy thunderclaps
And rend her smock a sunder.
But if that all relief,
And comforts does forsake me,
I Will hang my self for grief,
Nay then the Devil take me.
Her Ingenious her Answer so modestly delivered.
Answer.
YOur verses I received,
Like one of Cupids Martyrs,
Because you are so grieved
Go hang in your own garters.
I cannot choose but pity
Your lubbers mourning tears,
Because your plaints are witty,
You may go shake your ears.
To purchase your delight
No labor I will leese,
Your pains I will require
With a nogge of bread and cheese.
It Is you I fain would see,
It Is thee I only think on,
My looks as kind shall be
As the Devils over Lincoln.
I long to see thee here
I must enjoy thee one day,
Mean time come kiss me there
Where I did sit on Sunday.
Doctor Donnes Couplet.
HE that has business and makes love
Does do,
Such wrong as when a married man
Does woe.
The Version.
HE that makes love his business:
Then does do
No wrong at all, and married men
May woe.
A CATCH.
To the Tune of, New Oysters.
NEw Roysters, new Roysters, new Roysters new,
What tame Knights have you to dress,
Have you any Maids with child.
The wise contented Cuckold,
To an old Tune.
Who ere would lead a happy life,
All jealousy eschew
With no strict hand nor foolish strife,
Still let her have her due.
I Am a contented man,
And I have a dainty wife,
Who labors as much as she can,
To make me a happy life.
I Have neither money nor lands,
Nor trade to get me some bread,
Nor can I work with my hands,
And yet I am bravely fed.
I have clothes and money to spend,
I go and come when I will,
I drink a quart with a Friend,
Such Toll I get by my Mill.
I have good pewter and brass,
Two chambers furnished well,
I should be counted an ass,
How I got them, for to tell.
Brave Gallants come to my door,
And ask m^ for Madam Brown,
But your ill-bred Country-boor
Would Gammer-her like a Clown.
She winks, and I step aside,
Then entreats him to draw nigh;
And looks as sweet as a Bride,
As coy and as cunningly.
Up stairs she so nimbly goes,
You can hardly hear her tread,
She knows her friends from her foes,
It Is a pretty Rogue in a bed.
When the fool is sneaking gone,
She sits her down on my knee,
And cries my Dear Chuk, my John,
I Am fain to do this for thee.
It Is a plagny witty wench,
Steals money into my pocket,
And Tickles me like a Tench,
And for all gramercy blockhead.
All night sometimes she is out
At some great bodies labor,
She nimble whisks about,
As 'twere at a Pipe and a Tabor.
But when she comes home again,
She strokes my forehead and face,
And ever I cry Amen,
Where ever my wife says grace.
The Merchant sends in good wine,
Fat Gammons and Botargo,
We altogether do dine,
But Betty unlades his Cargo.
My Draper sends in fine cloth,
Her Mercer the richest silk,
The little Rogue gives them broth
But robs the Calves of their milk.
Fine linen, and silk stockings,
And sweet perfumed gloves,
She gets by Nurse-like Rockings,
Let others get by their Loves.
What fools will go bare and poor,
And starve for want of good meat,
And swear that his wife's a whore
When she goes forth to repeat.
If twenty light their candle
At mine, what is it the worse?
All things were made to handle,
All sorts of coin in a purse.
A wife that is a wag-tail born,
If curbed will spend thy estate;
It Is better to have my horn
Of plenty, let other men prate.
If all men be not like me,
They are more troubled than I,
I know the worst I can be,
It is but the chance of a dye.
A Ballad to some Friends in the Country.
IN place where claps are called Geese,
And farting is Icleped sneese,
So Marmalade is roasted Cheese;
Which no body can deny.
Where (men) women do make Cuckold
Holding land in Tenure Buck-hold,
Near the manor called Muck-hold (alias)
Which no body can deny.
Where Goats are by Hogs-Norton kept,
Where bad is good, and Boar-hunt left,
Where thou and I have often slept.
Where A-mare-Ill-is and her Cully,
Do parsonate or wench or Bully,
'Thout help of Ovid or of Tully.
Where men from tops of Towers do fly,
And yet no more then birds do die,
Such power's in sack-divinity.
Where Pigeons more then people prays,
For they at Church are still six days,
Their Croo is their expressive lays.
And on the seventh till bell does ring,
Where Hopkins rimes the people sing,
With a Hey derry down high ding.
But then the Homily being done,
The Lord invites the Vicar home,
Mistake not it is not he of Rome.
Where he the meat prays for, and drink,
With eyes of Faith, for he does wink,
The Cats eyes out just so do pink.
But in this place I have been told,
If on report I may be bold,
The folks are neither hot nor cold.
Two Vicars claim unto the Church,
And both alike the Parish lurch,
Yet lowly do the poor souls curch.
The one is house prays for the people,
Whose turrets do exceed the steeple,
The Del'e a one, who cares a peeble.
The other says that he does pray,
It Is for himself the people say,
And for his daughter by my fay.
I Am sure the folks are yet no better,
Then those who never read a letter,
Non legit finds the law a Debtor.
In such a place where corn does grow,
Where none do reap, nor none do sow,
And such a place as none does know.
It Is Paradise a man would think
But for the Rivers there of drink,
Where he that swims is sure to sink.
If these strange things be but as true
I Will come and see, till then adieu,
So here is a health to all the Crew,
Which no body dare deny.
The Da^byshire Maid.
A Jolly black Lass came up to the Town
And wandered about, till she came to Whitehall,
But when she had seen both Courtier and Clown
She liked the Lifeguard men better then all.
There was a Maid of Darby-shire,
Would needs come to the City
To see those sights which she had heard,
For she was wondrous witty.
She was so stout,
She looked about,
The doors and the shops were all open,
But then she said,
I am afraid
That they are lately broken.
She heard a Tinkers kettle ring,
Quoth she, here is bees a swarming,
And saw the folks go in and out
With such a noise and charming.
Yet was so stout,
She looked about
To see when the people would settle.
Or else that they
Would fly away,
Hearing no more the kettle.
But now she spied a Goldsmiths stall,
Where Gold was laid a sunning,
These Citizens are Fools she cried
Who have so little cunning,
We make a show
Of what we owe,
But no body knows our riches,
If this they give
They cannot live,
But beg for bread and breeches,
A little farther passing on,
She wondered at their breeding,
They cried fair Maid, what do you lack,
Here Is choice, take for your needing,
She thanked them all,
Both great and small,
Although she were but a stranger,
Yet she had friends,
Would make amends,
Of which there was no danger.
She bid good-deine, and then she heard,
A wench was crying marches,
Bellows to mend and kitchin-stuff,
She thought them singing catches;
By the mass quoth she
Those Ballads we,
Have from North^mpton Poet,
Nor Smithfield wares
With brains and stairs,
Are half so good I know it.
A guilt-coach with glass windows to it,
Just then was passing by her,
If all our houses were so built
Quoth she, we would fear no fire;
The footmen too,
Made such a show,
For Lords, she them saluted,
And duckt so low
That in one throw,
Her coats were all polluted.
To Covent Garden then she came,
With love so strong perfumed,
Seeing the Lifeguard there on horse,
She then was quite consumed.
Good Lord quoth she
These Princes be,
With Red-coats, and with Feathers,
The sword and belt,
My heart has felt,
No horse can break such Tethers.
I love not one alone, but all,
Five hundred horse and more-a,
And yet me thinks one Irishman
I still prefer before-a:
Oh happy sight
I take delight,
To see and smell their horses,
And for their good
Will keep my blood,
And kiss their very arses.
To my Lord Bellasyse in Tangier, upon a Newyears day.
COuld I as well (as wish) present,
It should not be a Complement;
But since the most that I possess,
Is from your Lordship, I confess,
Unless you will call this fruit mine own,
The seed was by your Lordship sown:
A soil (though rich) sometimes brings forth
But little grain, and little worth,
Being oversown with too much seed,
Shows it is fertile, though in weed;
And I, so much obleig'd, may say
Ingratitude's no sin this way:
But now I pray a happy year
I mean at Worlaby, not here,
Leaving the Rains in Africa,
Which throws down houses every day,
Washing the cement of our walls,
And one another by their falls
Beats down, seeming as they would say,
We Will make the mole, or choke the hay;
Those dear-bought cork-woods, fruits and flowers
The costly forts, and rotten towers,
Those fruits upon your Lordships wall
At Worlaby your own may call,
There Is no Levant, to blast your trees,
Nor house invaded by the seas,
The grass which grows before your doors,
Does hide no ambush of the Moors,
No Jacals to devour your sheep,
Nor public cares to break your sleep,
On Lincoln Heath, run for a cup,
Fill't with sound wine, and drink it up,
Here Is Malaga, mixed wine and stumme
Which kills outright or makes men dumb,
Leave meat unfound, and spanish fruits,
And nothing good but our old suits
To keep us warm, and from the sun,
And so my Creed of Tangiers done.
Nothing I know is wanting there,
And nothing else I know is here,
Then welcome to your Ithaca,
And happy be I ever pray,
In family, in friends, and fame,
In honor, fortune and good name;
In all things what you wish to be,
And one thing more I wish to see.
A Ballad,
To the Tune of the Song in the play of Bartholomew Fair. Youth, Youth, thou
had better been starved at thy Nurse.
YE wicked Fishmongers, and Butchers repent
And all ye Coal-sellers, as wicked or worse,
Who make the poor people keep all the year lent
Though you get their money, yet you have their curse,
Ye often have, been told,
Both young yea and old,
That wolves will devour our sheep in the fold.
What Cannibals are ye to eat one another,
And worser then wolves to sister and brother,
'Twere better by much ye never had been born,
Then men should be like to beasts that wear horns.
Ye Brewers and Bakers, who cosen the poor,
With weights and with measures, it is shame for to tell,
And make them to run so fast on the score,
For which ye run faster (God bless us) to Hell,
Ye often have been taught,
Good comes not of naught,
And gold is not good, if too dearly be bought.
Then pray be contented with moderate gains,
Amend your bad lives, and wash out your slains,
Least that if a Famine should come, I tell true,
Instead of good meat, the poor would eat you.
Ye Ladies and Gallants who slaunt it so gay,
Remember the poor whilst ye are above ground,
And still give a little, ye well enough may,
Repent and relent, amend and be sound,
I tell ye in time,
In this godly Rhyme,
That the other world is a much hotter clime,
Then do some good deeds, whilst ye are in the way,
Defer it no longer to another day,
What thanks will ye have to give (when ye die)
To the rich now the poor do starvingly lie.
Ye gamesters who sit up whole nights at your dice,
And never consider the time that ye spend,
And think that fair-play is a virtue not vice,
Although ye undo your selves or your friend:
But take it from me,
Who ever ye be,
From cheating and swearing, ye are not all free,
And men do but flatter themselves in a sin,
To get from another a point or a pin;
For covetousness is the root of all ill,
The rich are made poor, the poor poorer still.
Ye merchants and Citizen-trades of all sorts,
Who eat of the best, and trick-up your wives,
Who take your delights in plays and in sports,
Your wares are no better, then are your bad lives.
There are some good men,
Yet not one in ten,
But says to what e're he can get his Amen,
Alack and-a day for ill gotten goods
Will moulder away like sands with the sloods,
Repent and be humble, give well to the poor,
What Is honestly got increases your store.
Remember those thousands who lately have died,
Remember your fears and your promises made,
Your sins of Rebellion, your lusts and your pride,
Take heed you relapse not, unto the same trade:
Amend all your lives,
Both husbands and wives,
For they must needs go, when the Devil it is drives,
Fear God in the first place, the King next obey,
Each one love their neighbor, let all of us pray,
Our peace and our plenty will then so succeed,
Though all be not rich, yet none will have need.
The Day star of the North.
A Maid so fair, so chaste, and good,
And anciently of British blood,
From Maddocks Princes of North Wales,
Does now in Doncaster reside,
So famed of all both far and wide.
THis wonder of the Norther star,
Which shines so bright at Donc^ster
Does threaten all mankind a war,
Which no body can deny.
The French, the Dutch, and Danish fleet,
If ever they should come to meet,
Must all lie captives at her feet,
Which no body can deny.
High blooded Princes and hot Peers,
Must altogether shake their ears,
Though never so bold in their cariers,
Which no body can deny.
Your small Knights-errant; she defies,
For if that any one she spies,
To look on her, he surely dies,
Which no body can deny.
Had Randolph been a Rowland too,
Alas 'twere more then they could do,
To stand the brunt of such a foe,
Which no body can deny.
A hundred Knights at once she killed
Or maimed so she made them yield,
Not one of them could touch her shield,
Which no body can deny.
The bravest Knights, though never so bold,
But like sheep driving to a fold,
She makes their hearts as tame and cold,
Which no body can deny.
The fairest Queens of Amazons,
With her brought in comparisons,
Are Pigmies to the greatest Dons,
Which no body can deny.
Had Hercules met this one maid,
Though fifty in one night he paid,
Yet here he would have proved a Jade,
Which no body can deny.
If all our guards of horse were there,
The oaths of chastity must swear,
Or all of them she would cashiere,
Which no body can deny.
The peace we talk of with the Dutch
Does not concern us half so much,
We better know to deal with such,
Which no body can deny.
We first should make a peace with her,
As York did once with Lancaster,
So London now with Doncaster,
Which no body can deny.
Defend us, should she come to town,
And on the Court at White Hall frown,
Then all the folks would tumble down,
Which no body can deny.
Nay worse then that, our women too,
She Would teach them all to answer no,
Then we should have no more to do,
Which no body can deny.
What would become of all our youth,
So Ticklish in tail and mouth,
In this new mode of honest truth,
Which no body can deny.
No, no, she never must come here,
We must not live in so much fear,
The North's enouggh to govern there,
Which no body can deny.
The Northern Lass to the same Person,
To a new Tune.
Fairer maid cannot be found,
In any place on English ground,
Fame gives her out as good as fair,
It Is very true; though wondrous rare.
There dwells a Maid in Doncaster,
Is named Betty Maddocks,
No fallow Deer so plump and fair
E're fedd in Park or Paddocks.
Her skin as sleek
As Taffies Leek,
And white as the other end on it,
Like snow does melt,
So soon as felt,
Could you but once descend on it.
The spider-weaver never spun
Threads like her lovely tresses,
Like purled gold, the curled ends
Choice Nature made for dresses;
Adown they flow,
Her feet below,
Allparts are now so hidden,
You cannot spy,
(Figg-leaves laid by)
One twist of the forbidden.
Her eyes have no comparison,
But like to one another,
Her lips are twins, fine Lobster-red,
And those who would not smother,
Her wasps-like, wast,
So neatly Iac't,
Without a sting in the tail on it,
Yet though there were,
I wonder where
The man is, who would fail on it.
I Am sure high-mounting Cavaliers,
Have often there alighted,
She was the business, they had there
And still they were benighted:
Both Lord and Duke,
She made to puke,
In love so much be-spatter'd,
But not a touch,
For never so much,
Not one of them she mattered.
A hundred horse beshrew my heart,
At once to ride on wooing,
And by a stout Commander led,
With hopes of mighty doing,
No Officer,
Nor Brigadier,
Nor Quarstermaster sent her,
With all their horse,
And mighty force,
Could in her quarters enter.
Yet she permitted them to eat,
And drink whilst they would tarry,
A thousand oaths were sworn to bed
Her first, and then to marry;
In troth quoth she,
Your honesty,
Appears in making matches,
When I am wedd,
I Will go to bed,
And not be sung in Catches.
Of seven husbands I have read,
But of a hundred never,
And since I cannot marry all,
For one I will endeavor;
This I propose
To him a choose,
For I will have this Trial,
But dance me down,
I am his own,
He shall have no denial.
They danced a Jigg, but fell so fast,
There Is none could bear up to her,
Only the gallant that came last,
Made oath he would undo her:
She smil^ng said,
Poor me a maid,
Must live a little longer,
And straight she found
Him on the ground,
Now hopes to find a stronger.
The Parson of Rumford, or a merry maying,
To the Tune of, Away to Twiford, away, away.
I Sing of no Ladies who dance in the Court,
Nor of the bigg Lords, so hugeously gay,
But of Lads and of Iasses, who make as good sport,
Then away to Rumford, away, away.
From Burnt-wood, and Epping, from Bow, and Mile-end,
With ribbons and flowers, with garlands for May,
Fine girls and their lovers did trip it an end,
And away to Rumford, away, away.
The streets with green rushes, and bowers of boughs,
To welcome these guests, the music does play,
The houses as sweet as the breaths of our cows,
Come away to Rumford away, away.
What tricking, what trimming, what puddings, what sowse,
Nay mustard with beef prepared for the day,
And Piggs that the Parson kept long in his house
For this meeting at Rumford to day, to day.
But O, the brave Gammons with pepper and cloves,
And stinging good ale, was there by my fay.
As sweet and as hot as the buss of our loves,
Come away to Rumford, away, away.
Then cheese-cakes, with currants so finely were set,
Your Ladies black-patches, are not so gay,
Stew'd-pruins in a syrup, as black as the jet,
Come away to Rumford, away, away.
This woundy great feast the Parson did make,
In his close-girt-coat, as pert as a Jay,
Could no more stand still, then a beat at a stake,
In the town of Rumford, to day, to day.
For joy, he spurt'd us a question to marry,
And told us the season was best in May,
Go to it quoth he, for time will not tarry,
And welcome to Rumford, I say, I say.
We looked, and we looked on one another,
He formerly taught us our flesh was but clay,
Why should we not join, like sister and brother,
It Is time at Rumford, to day, to day.
Then Rowland a Keeper in Epping Chase,
As bold as a stagg at his Rut, did say.
Fair Win -- now 'Ile marry, not bating an Ace,
This day at Rumford, to day to day.
She blushed, and she wished it were quietly done*
But said good Rowland, what have is I pray,
Now you hold me so fast that I cannot run,
This night then in Rumford, I Will stay, I Will stay.
Now hey for Burnt-wood, Tom Tanner did cry,
His face shining yellow, his hands brown bay,
He swor'd he would be coupled to Jenny or dye,
In the Town of Rumford, to day, to day.
Dick Butcher of Bow came in a great huffe,
Swore Doll of the Dairy should lead the way,
Since both he and she handled much better stuff,
In the Town of Rumford, then they, then they.
Little Robbin a glover of Mile-end Town,
With Mawd who dwelt at the Bottle of Hay,
Were clapped together with a hey derry down,
And all in Rumford to day, to day.
A dozen in couples, more the next morn,
Went all to the Church to marry and pray,
That every one might have a small pocket horn,
When they went from Rumford, away, away.
Strike up Tom Piper, and Kit with your Fiddle,
Play Room for Cuckolds, it is now almost day,
Go home with your wives, and play at downdiddle,
And away from Rumford, away, away.
Carolus, A Carolo, Carolo Magno Major. Upon his Highness the Duke of York, his
Victory, at Sea over the Dutch.
WHat saucy mungrel slaves are those,
Greater then Charles the great to oppose,
M^screant Mahounds, Rebel-state,
Your daring hastens on your fate,
Will Puny-Gyants make a war,
Against Heavens praedict, by a star,
Calling to Battle mighty York
A glorious man to do their work;
Vain pufft up Bubbles, durst ye think,
That ye could swim, and he should sink,
Great men are called to sit above;
Your grovelling souls, toth' Center moove,
Are Princes Prize for Butter-boxes,
Or Lions to be taken by Foxes:
Ye Mushromes grown under our shade,
Who your own safeties have betrayed,
Forgiu's Heaven we did maintain
Those Boars against the King of Spain,
But nature planted against your shoars
English to kill such brawny Boars,
It Is a Kings evil, which we cure,
And stroaking now you must endure,
A second gift our Charles has blessed,
To cure Rebellion in the breast,
When we protected Fishermen,
Innocent we thought ye then,
Ye practiced new Apostle-ship,
And through the world your selves did ship,
As Missioners from Heaven sent
To farm the world at such a Rent,
Forgiveness for your former crimes
Might have been had, if begged betimes,
For justice now Amboyna calls:
Who sins a new, by old sins falls.
Your hoped Protector, of our France,
Will but your Miseries advance,
Protectors thrice not in this age
Which he may find in the second page:
Infatuated men ye are
No hope for mercy's in this war,
Since some men's lives, this war has cost
Will not be paid when Holland's lost,
Like Jews throughout the world you will be
Slav'd and condemned to infamy,
Into the Sea go headlong down
Those very graves are not your own,
Ye never had the fishing trade,
So much your own and so well paid,
The next season and fair weather,
We Will catch the fish and you together,
For British Monarchs will command,
All ye called yours by sea or land,
Over the whole world, Sea-soveraign
First conquered by our Charlemain.
A Ballad on a Friends wedding,
to the Tune of Sir John Sucklings Ballad.
As an Attendant on Sir John
I wait without comparison,
Great difference is in our pen
And something in the Maids and Men,
I do not write to get a name
At best, this is but Ballad-fame,
And Suckling has shut up that door,
To all hereafter as before.
NOw Tom if Suckling were alive,
And knew who Harry were to wive,
He Would shift his scaene I trow,
From Charing Cross to Clarkenwel
And sure as fine a Tale would tell,
As he did long ago.
But since his wit has left no heir
I Will sing my song of such a pair,
The like has not been seen,
In all our markets round about
Within our City-walls, or out,
God bless the King and Queen.
The youth I was about to name
But 'twere too much to lessen fame,
So known of such a grace,
Who amongst the ladds and lasses too,
There Is none who makes a greater do,
At every game and chase.
The maid so fair as by report,
The brightest ladies in the court,
Were surely much afraid,
Least she appearing should displace,
The vogue of any better face,
It Is not unlikely said.
But Cloris and her sheapherd too
Are not concerned, what others do,
Under an humble Vne,
Both sitting, in one instant say,
(Too long) to morrow will the day,
Be then I shall be thine.
Poor innocents they knew not why,
Yet would with one another lie,
Their thoughts were grown so great
And Poetiz'd their fancy,
That they immortalized should grow,
Would neither sleep nor eat.
Alike to them was day or night,
They were so raptured with delight.
And measured time by thought,
Their clothes by custom they put on,
And hand in hand walked fast along
So found the Priest they sought.
The holy-man forgot his book
And now and then he stole a look,
As often about to pray,
Believing something there inshrin'd,
So much transcending humane kind,
He knew not what to say.
But fearing that he might offend
The Saint so newly made his friend,
Dispatched what he begun,
The Bride and Bridegroom left the place,
As they had been to run a race,
Scarce knowing what was done.
The people whom they passed by
As if it were some hue and cry,
Forsook their houses quite,
And by pursuing came at last
To find the doors and windows fast,
Where they had made their flight.
The guests invited to the day
Came there, but knew not what to say,
It was so strange a thing,
No meat nor music, favors, gloves,
Posset nor cakes to show their loves,
The Bride had but a Ring.
Thus full three days and nights are fled,
Since that the sheapherds took their bed,
'Twas time I trow to rise,
For mortaliz'd they are again,
And call for meat like other men,
Nature must have supplys.
The Prae-invited guests came in
Like those who had intranced been,
None gave that days salute,
Seeing the blushing sheapherds sit,
Like our first Parents, for a bit
Of the forbidden fruit.
But then a matron aged threescore,
Though truly told, full twenty more,
Thus to the Bridegroom says,
But not ashamed thou have done well
And doing often is a spell,
All women love to praise.
The married, and the maids applause,
Soon known by hems at every clause,
The scene is altered quite,
For now the house with noise does ring,
In every tongue and tail a sting,
For such another night.
The Soldier who at push of pike,
Says one, stands longest I do like,
And thrusts, and thrusts again;
Another cries, I love the brunt
And brave enduring in the front,
Give me such sprightly men.
But then a blushing maid replys,
My father told my mother lies,
And so may others do;
He promised her, the Seamans vow,
But he performed the Lord knows how,
And glad she had it too.
Now supper called the Music plays
Healths to those pleasant nights and days,
The sheapherds lately past;
The tables drawn, a dance or two,
The Bride and Groom had more to do,
Such as they did the last.
But stay the maids, now claim a right
A custom, (yet) of much despite,
To see the Bride in bed,
Which willingly she would excuse
Though seemingly did not refuse,
'Twas now no May-den-head.
The men for Bridal garters strive
The Mayds for Codpeice points alive,
But see a wondrous escape;
For had his breeches now been on,
Had suffered a dissection,
Or they had made a Rape.
But still the stockings are to throw,
Some threw too high, and some too low,
There Is none could hit the mark:
But left the bride and bridegroom to it,
Assut'd enough that they could do it,
Though it were never so dark.
Of Amity and Friendship.
AMity is a sacred flame,
Nature first kindled in our breasts,
That heat extinct; only the name
Equal remains to men and beasts.
Soul of the world; true Amity,
As needful is to all mankind,
As fire and water, for we see
Without no joy nor taste we find.
Salt of our life, nursing mother
To all society humane,
A friend to me, is my brother,
Against an Abel was a Cain.
Tyrants in nature had they power
The Soul of friendship would destroy,
Malice and bad men would deflowr
What e're themselves could not enjoy.
Friendship suffices to preserve
The world; no need of laws to bind,
Which now as second means does serve,
To awe those wills to bad inclind.
However the law takes place below,
For friendship rules the heart and hand,
Our wills and the effects; we know,
The Law but outsides can command.
All good lawmakers ever had
A greater care of Amity
Then Justice; though the laws not bad,
Yet sometimes credit loose we see.
Friendship distinguished into parts
Nature, virtue, profit, pleasure,
Virtue the noblest wedlocks hearts,
It Is the souls indies natures measure.
The portract and description
Of perfect friendship is a free,
And general confusion,
Of souls exchanged in Amity.
Not only a conjunction
Of solid things however knit,
There may be separation,
This perfect love will not admit.
The souls are plunged and drowned so
In one another that you can,
No more divide then you can do,
Things liquid, or create a man.
On choice and liberty of will,
It Is built without exception,
Goods, honors, judgments, thoughts and will,
Nay life; this is perfection.
From this confusion proceeds
You cannot lend nor give to each.
No speech of good turns or good deeds,
Nor thanks for that declares a breach.
In common friendships these are found
The nourishers; in union
Those testimonies are not sound,
But signs are of division.
'Twere nonsense and strange complement
To thank my self for what I do,
Unto my self who can invent,
I should divide my self in two.
Disputers in Religion
Like talkers are of Amity,
For in a thousend there is not one,
Who practice that divinity.
Oh sacred friendship much abused!
Transmuted into policy,
For want of wit he is accused,
Has friendship and true honesty.
Were all to Avarice inclined,
The world would quickly have an end,
Meum not Tuum we should find,
Would leave but one himself to friend.
God was for money bought and sold,
Yet still we dote on cursed pelf,
May he that makes (his God) his gold,
Like that Apostate hang himself.
Perverted principles; for truth
Is now asserted interest,
The Religion of age and youth,
Friendship's a name without a Test.
FINIS.
Postcript to the Reader.
NOw you have paid, and Read, Farewell.
Be wiser yet and keep counsel,
For like to him who showed a Mare
Horse and no Horse, to be seen there,
The Tail was where the Head should be,
Tot'h Manger tied; my Poetry;
Is such a show; for wanting Coin,
The Lion with the Fox I join.
And thank ye all for this Relief
It Is better then a Begging-brief,
In all this Town ye cannot find
A fitter Man to cheat the Blind.
