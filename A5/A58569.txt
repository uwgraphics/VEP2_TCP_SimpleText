ACT, In Favors of the Vassals and Creditors Of Forefaulted Persons.
Edinburgh, April 27. 1689.
THE Estates of this Kingdom being fully Resolved to put the Laws to due and
speedy Execution, against all Rebellious and Treacherous Subjects, who shall
not submit to the present Government of the Estates, under King William and
Queen Mary; So they are most willing to Patronize and Encourage all those who
are True and Loyal to the same: And it being one of the great Grievances of
this Nation, that in the late Times, many Honest and Faithful Subjects have
been Ruined and Undone in their Estates and Fortunes, for other Men's Crimes and
Rebellions, to which they had no Accession. Therefore the Estates, for the
further Encouragement of all good Subjects in their Obedience, and that no
Person be punished for the Crime of another, Do Declare and Ordain, That no
Vassal or Creditor, Personal or Real, shall be prejudged or loss any of their
Lands or Estates, or any of their true and just Sums, resting to them by their
said Superiors, or Debitors Forefaulture, unless the said Vassals or Creditors
Join, Concur with, or Assist the said Superiors, or Debitors in their Treason,
or Rebellion. And Ordains these. Presents to be forthwith Published at the
Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and Head-Burghs of the respective Shires of this
Kingdom. Extracted forth of the Records of the Meeting of the Estates, by me
