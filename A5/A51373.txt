PROPOSALS by William Morgan His Majesty's Cosmographer, for Vending Mr.
Ogilby's WORKS in a Standing LOTTERY, to Enable him to Finish BRITANNIA, with
the Second Part of ASIA, and EVROPE.
By His MAJESTY's Authority under the Great Seal, etc. Hillary Term 1676/7
WHEREAS John Ogilby Esquire his Majesty's Cosmographer, with the Approbation and
Encouragement of His most Gracious Majesty, His Royal Highness, the Lords of
the Council, and others of the Nobility; did Undertake the Actual Survey of
England, etc. In Order to the Compiling an Historical and Geographical
Description thereof, under the Title of BRITANNIA.

The Charge being Computed by the Lords Referrees to 14000 l. toward which,
His Majesty and His Royal Consort being followed by Their Royal Highness's,
with some of the Nobility, and the City of London, there was Subscribed 1900 l.

By which, and the Disposal of Part of his Books in a Standing Lottery; He,
with the Assistance of his Kinsman William Morgan, Proceeded so far as to
Publish the First Volume, and Prepare as much Work for the Volume of
County-Maps as has Cost 4000 l. more; the Charge of what is already Surveyed,
etc. amounting to above 7000 l. which is upwards of 5000 l. more than has been
Received by Subscription.

And, whereas since the Death of Mr. Ogilby, William Morgan has undertaken the
said Work, having Finished and Published the Actual Survey of London to general
Satisfaction. And earnestly desiring suddenly to Complete a Work so much to the
Honor and Advantage of His Majesty and His Kingdoms, especially since it is
brought so near Perfection. He does hereby expose the whole Remainder of Mr.
Ogilby's Books in this Lottery, wherein is Proposed Considerable Ga^n at no
Great Adventure.

And to the End the Lots may be suddenly Drawn, and the Number of Blanks easily
known; finding also by former Experience, that few or none adventure less than
Twenty Shillings, It is thought good to make the Lots 20 s. a-piece, allowing
near two Prizes for one Blank, the least Prize being a Book of 18 s. which,
whosoever Draws single and does not like, shall receive 15 s. for it again.

The Number of the Prizes is 1382. amounting to 2575 l. but by lessning the
Blanks is reduced to 2182 l. for the Number of Blanks are but 800. which added
to the 1382 Prizes 20 s. each, is 2182 l.

But considering the Abatements made in the Proposals, and the Satisfaction
given to those that fortune to Draw Blanks, the Adventurers will have the Books
for less than half the Value; which, for their Encouragement, will certainly,
when this Disposal is over, advance; as has done the Price of the BIBLE, which
being sold by Mr. Ogilby for Thirty Shillings, is now raised to Five Pounds Ten
Shillings; for that none of these Books will ever be Printed again.

THE PROPOSALS.
I. The Price of each Lot is Twenty Shillings, but to avoid the Loss of Time,
and the Charge of long Attendance on Drawing the Lots, who so pleases to
adventure in the Box shall be abated One Shilling; the Adventurer paying Ten
Shillings on the receipt of his Ticket, and Nine Shillings when he receives his
Books, which shall be as soon as Drawn. II. They that adventure for Five Lots,
paying Fifty Shillings beforehand as aforesaid, shall be abated 1 s. 6 d. in
the Pound; or be Presented to the Value if they Draw under 5 l. III. Such as
adventure for Ten Lots, paying Five Pound beforehand as aforesaid, shall
receive one additional Lot, viz. Eleven for Ten; and be Presented to the Value
if they Draw under 10 l. IV. Whosoever adventures Forty Shillings and shall
happen to Draw two Blanks, shall be presented with a Book of Forty Shillings.
We doubt not by this fair and cheap Vendition of Our Books to raise Money, and
then, beside the Progress will be made in the Survey of England, the
Subscribers may expect Asia Perfect before Michaelmas next, and Europe in short
time after.
