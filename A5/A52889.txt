A New BALLAD,
To the Tune of, I Will tell thee, Dick, etc.
CHil tell thee, Tom, the strangest story,
Because thou art an honest Tory;
It Is News beyond expressions:
Zich zights are no where to be zeen
In any Land, ( God zave the Queen)
But at our Quarter-Zessions.
Vor Rogues I zaw in zich a place,
As would the Gibbet quite disgrace,
It Is pity it should want 'em:
But how the Devil they came there,
List, Tom, and chil in brief declare*
And How they did recant 'em.
When I was late at London-Town,
To zee zome zights ever I went down,
To White Hall I did venture;
And having on my best Array,
As vine as on a Holy Day,
Zoors I made bold to enter.
Up stairs I went, which were as brooad,
And Dirty too as any Rooad,
Or as the streets of the Zity.
Had thou been there, thou would have zaid
There had been no Servant Maid,
Gods zooks, and that is a pity.
When I was up, I did discern
A Chamber bigger than a Barn,
Where I did zee Voke stand,
That I was well near vrighted quite,
It was so strange and grim a zight,
With long things in their hand.
Their Clothing cannot well be told,
On which were things of beaten Gold
Upon their Back and Breast;
I doft my Hat when I came in,
Quoth I* Pray which of you's the King?
Which made a woundy Jest.
At last came by a Gentlemon,
Who made me zoon to understand
I need not be avear'd;
Quoth he, Come on, and vollow me,
Chil show thee strait His Majesty,
Vor theas are but his Guard.
But, Tom, not any Wake or Vair
Can show zich numbers as are there,
Still cringeing low, and bowing,
That I may zwear, and tell no lie,
They wearier are, than Thou or I
With Thrashing or with Plowing.
No Ants do vaster lead or drive,
Or Bees buz to or fro' the Hive*
I marl they were not dizzy;
And zure the Nations great Avairs
Lay heavily upon their Cares,
They looked zo wise and busy.
At last came in His Majesty,
No taller though than Thou or I;
Yet, whatzoe'r I ailed,
With only gazing on His Vace,
I trembled like a Love-zick-Lass
Just on the point to yield.
He looked, methought, above the rest,
Though not by half zo vinely dressed,
Which made me vall a zwearing,
A Pox upon the Parliament,
That will not let us pay him Rent,
Gold's only for his wearing.
A Ribbon vine came cross avore,
Zich as our Landlords Bridemen wore,
At end of which was hung
A curious thing, that shone as bright
As Maudlin's eyes, or morning light,
When gilded by the Zun,
But now the News, chil tell thee Truth,
Hard by his zide there stood a Youth,
That looked as trim and gay,
As if he had not guilty bin
Of wishing ever to be a King,
Unless a King of May.
It was the zame our Vicar zed
Vor Treason should have lost his Head,
Vor which vive hundred Pound
By Proclamation offered was
To any that should take his Grace
In any Kerson ground.
Won Zunday morn, thou may remember*
I think the twontieth of Zeptember,
Our Parson read a thing,
How this zame Spark, (a vengeance on him*)
With vorty moor, did take upon him
To kill our Gracious King.
But scant the vrighted harmless Zwain,
That meets a Wolf upon the Plain,
Was zo aghast with vear:
Wounds! if His Majesty (quoth I)
Does keep no better Company,
Chil stay no longer here.
With that, the Mon that brought me in
By the Jacket pulled me back again;
Quoth he, Pray hear ye reason;
He was a What-d'ye-calt* it is true,
But's Pardon makes him vree as you
Vrom Knavery or Treason.
Whaw whaw! quoth I, a pretty Nick,
To make Rogues honest by a trick
Zo often tried in vain;
As if my Bull should gore me once,
I Would trust the zenseless Beast with Horns
To gore me o'r again.
Chil even to Devonshire again,
Where honest men are honest men,
And Rogues are hanged vor Rogues.
Ods wounds! were I His Majesty,
Ever zich a Zon should count'nanc'd be,
Chi'd prize him as my Dogs.
