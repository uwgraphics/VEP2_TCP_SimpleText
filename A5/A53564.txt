OUT-CRIE OF THE OF THE KINGS AT WESTMINSTER: or, the Junto who call themselves
a PARLIAMENT.

For their Lamentable banging at Colchester, and the Havoc made of their
Sainted Army there, Conducted, by the gowty Rebel Tom Fairfax, by the gallant
Royallists under the command of the Right Honorable the Earl of Norwich, and
the most valiant Sir Charles Lucas:

As also, For the routing of Lambert in the North, the Revolt of the Navy, the
loss of Pontfract-Castle, and for the good affections of their Sovereign.

TO KING GOWTY-LIES.

And art thou lame, what pocky Rheum durst ceaze,
On thy great Excellence, the French disease:
Was sure too saucy, thy Rebellious looks,
Frights more then Cromwels nose, all plannet struck;
Stand trembling at thy words, and yet though thus,
All could not stagger Morbus Gallicus:
Howl out thy Soul in pain, prevent the ill,
Must else fall on thee, by the hangmans skill:
Unless the Queen of Chance, so love thy Good,
That Goring now in Essex, let thee blood;
He has protested to his Loyal Rout,
Ere many days to cure thee of the gowt:
Mean time (good Sir) thou do not halt alone,
The masters of the Damned Rebellion:
Go, limping toe. Fate has ^a^e off their edge,
And nothing wants, but halter, Fire, and sledge.

THE OUTCRY OF THE KINGS AT WESTMINSTER, or, the Junto, who call themselves a
PARLIAMENT.
Their first Complaint.
When we had Fortune in a string,
And all at our command:
Close prisoner, clapped up our King,
Grown great by Sea and Land.
When all men followed Cromwels Nose,
When we had gulled our Nation:
And quite subdued our Royal Foes,
With I^^kies approbation.
When as the People seemed content,
We on their backs should ride:
An Everlasting Parliament,
Even at the height of pride.
When we had cast to kill our King,
By poison, in his meat:
Then Osburne did find out the thing,
And England saw, a cheat.
MOst venerable Rabbis, of the Synod, to you we turn our selves, now in our
extremity you that are the Pulpit drummers of the times, and by whose
persuasion, we first engaged against our Sovereign Lord, you that have proved
by divine Sylogismes, that St. Peter's counsel to fear God, and obey the King,
is Apocripha, and that S. Paul's advice willing us to submit upon pain of
Damnation, is merely a fallacious Assertion.

No cursed Rebellion ever yet took wings,
To assail the Person and the State of Kings:
But it derived its current from the gown,
And made its fatal exit, with the clown:
Gouge, unto thee, to Marshall, and to Nie,
We owe the hatching of our Treachery:
Most holy Dragons, Devils clad with light,
You first divulged the Plot, of Hell, and night:
Cursed in your mothers wombes, the Bishops fate,
Your vile transactions will obliterate:
Perjurd you are, the Bishops Cap and hood,
Have not been torn by you, though did in blood
Those decent ornaments, preserved are,
When they assume their states, again to wear:
Was it indeed, that you Cride order down,
To play at free-ball with the staff and crown;
That so while as our English Machine cracks,
You each may bear six Steeples on your backs:
Have you turned absolution out of Doors,
That so you only may absolve your whores:
We have made use of you as desperate men,
Use person and return to dust again:
Our own Rebellious courses, now we rue,
We must taste vengeance so we wish may you.
The preposterousnesse of Fate, was ever Rebellion in more thriving course,
then under our management, have we not took away the fundamental Laws of our
Land, root and branch, have we not forced a single Ordinance, as if a Statute,
have we not taken away all order and discipline in the Church, and that the
people might loose the fear of God, and obedience to their King at once have
countenanced a General tolleration have we not ceazed on all our Kings
revenew, his ships at sea, and his Militia by land, have we not a chosen Army
whom we keep up on purpose to overaw the people to plunder their goods (and if
we command) to kill their person at our pleasure, have we not our spies in each
corner of the land, and more especially in London to whom we allow annual
stipends whose task it is, to intrude themselves into all customs, and to
insinuate into men's favor that so they may with more facility, learn their
dispositions and resolutions, that so we may be informed thereof, and if we
know them Loyal, to murder them, or starve them in prison, as we did lately
to Sir Thomas Shirley whom we sent prisoner to S. Peter, without so much as
telling him for what, as also to Sir Thomas Cooper, who has since escaped our
hands, have we not so impoverished the people by our plunderings and taxes,
that they are not so much as in a possibility of resistance, have we not
inured them so to bondage, that they are as pliable to our commands as the tand
gally-slave to his oate, have we not clapped up our King close prisoner in the
Isle of Wight, and can we not murder him there at our pleasures, are we not
now a Free an absolute State, our selves Kings, and the King useless are we
not.

Melancholicus
-- most seditious wicked Devils,
Traitors who act the very worst of evils:
Whose best of Faith is ^el^ breach of trust
Whose zeal serves only for to he^t your lust:
Lay now aside your boasts, and if there be,
Left in your breasts so much Christianity:
Betake you to your prayers, your Kingdoms gone,
And CHARLES must once more fill his Royal throne:
Three Royal Armies war likely arrayed,
Come bravely on, with banners broad displayed: FIGHT,
Whose mottoe's this THE CAUSE FOR WHICH WE
IS FOR OUR GOD OUR KING AND CHVRCHES RIGHT:
Though you despite of heaven still go on,
And still abet, your vile Rebellion,
Yet know and be not blinded, Essex men,
Will have your heads, and eke their King again:
The Earl of Norwich, Canel, Campion,
Lunsford, Ga^eoigne, Many, Washington,
Villiers, Th^^^hill, Culpepper, List, and
The rest, that now brave Colchester command,
Have lately banged Tom gowty legs, yea so
He never shall, get strength again to go.
The noble LVCAS, lately sallied out,
And put the blood-bounds to a total Rout:
And since has stuff two Churches, with the Saints,
Who fill the ecchoing walls, with loud complaints,
Has taken 7 Piece of Ordnance, next you will hear,
Your Army's left, and to add to your fear,
Lambert is soundly beaten, Langdale's Forte,
Has routed all his Army foot and horse,
From all points of the Compass, now come on
Your miseries, and your destruction,
Inevitable is, where is your Navy?
Fall Traitors on the Land, the Sea cannot save yea.
All loyal Souls, now join, one hand, one heart,
It Is that alone, these Rebels must subvert.
They proceed in their Outcry.

The Army before Colchester rowted, the Scots now in England, Lambert put to
the worst by Langdale, the Navy revolted, and the whole Kingdom rising upon
us, the Son of our wronged Sovereign, daily expected with an Army against us,
which way, whither shall we run, will the People be no longer cheated with
shows, nor deluded with Chimeras, money we have store, but what does that
avail us, must we make those our heirs, whose wealth was their own, ere we
extorted it, does both heaven and earth conspire our ruin, but must we fall so
speedily, the Tame Animals of the City resolve to support us to the last, O
lack Hall, Jack Hall, strain this invention to the highest pitch, let
blasphemy and Treason both commix, thou shall not want, either thy self or
pander, write any thing good Jack, now thou have entered Covenant with us, thou
must resolve with us to fall or rise, if the Royall-party prevail.

Ah tum te miserum, malique Fati
Quem atractis pedi^s, prarente porta
Percurrunt maligelesque, raphanique.
Ah thee thee wretched of accursed Part,
Whom Fish wives, Red fish wives of base estate.
Shall scoff and trample on the open gate.
O Lilly, Lille, thou that can command the stars to move, according to the
composure o thy fingers, thou that can cloth the dead Saints with flesh and
make the Furits of Barathrum to tremble at thy summons, thou that employed
the winged Spirits of the Air, to perform thy frequent Em^ ^ffa^s, thou that
have shouldered up our greatness hitherto, and persuaded the people into a
good opinion of us, for the allowance to 1 per annum, and a share of all
eminent Thanksgiving Dinners, why did not thou forsee, this great unlookt for
unlucky change, thou prognosticatedst peace and tranquillity, a happy event to
crown all our undertakings, and that we should prove the most glorious
villains, that ever were, now we find Wharton, is a true Prophet, and that his
predictions, are ratified above, his 28 of June is come, and destruction dogs
us like our Destiny, o Booker, Booker, did not thy great head harbor one
conceit for the security, could thy Chrisolite which thou stolest, show thee
nothing, when thou compilest thy last bumbasted Almanac, our Prophets are
planet struck, and our Deviners mad; o Weaver, what a web have we now upon the
Loome, o Wild, how wildly have we rambled to our ruin, o Corbet what will
become of thy smokey visinemir, which the Cavaliers have threatened to sowse and
caribnado, and then send it as an hoggsface to Pluto, for him to feast the
Fiends withal, o Scot, what will now be thy Lot; o Warner, we sorrow for
thee extremely, for the Roguing Apprentices, will now have an opportunity to
perform their vows, and to nail thy leather ears, to the door post of thine
own house; o Lenthall, our flippant speaker. who have spoke so well for us this
seven years, and so dexterously, have pleaded thy own cause, that thou art
now master of many millions of money, all which we hope (as forseeing this
storm) thou have convei'd to some foreign land; o Challenor, what will become
of thee, and thy wall eyes, o Rolls, how are we rolling down the hill on the
sudden, who some few months since, sat tryumphing on the top of Fortunes
wheel; o Marten, thou were wise, and gotst thy self with thy leash of
curtezans into a place of strength, where thou may remain with safety, till
thy house be fired about thee, thy ears, and thy head sent for a present to
the King: whereas we are bare breasted, and stand as marks for the intensed
people to shoot at o Tom Fairfax what will become of thee, when thy gowty legs
shall be chopped off, with thy head, and arms and the Cavaliers kick thee up and
down Westminster, as a football, o Nol, Nol, what will become of thy Nese, if
thou be yet mortal, which the Cavaliers will cut off, and fix it for a
Reacon, on highgate-hill, oh, oh our Desteny: Melancholicus,
-- does haunt you, and the iron hand of love,
Will crush you into air, in vain you strove,
To force the thunderers arm, back to his thie,
By voting home King Charles, and so to try,
The peoples temper, if their madness great,
Would have accepted, of this second cheat:
Most holy Statel-men, blessed Reformers, you
To whom all possible applause is due,
Why should you fear, if sacred Innocence,
Do guard you, fear not humane violence,
But see then countenances, do declare,
That they of horrid Treason; guilty are,
Guilty of blood, of cruelties and horrors,
Drencht deep in Sin, chief authors of our terrors:
What will you do, or whether will you run,
Your most inevitable Fate to shun,
They are ama'zd, fall then, as in a trance,
For on your bodies, Loyalty must Dance.


Since we must fall, let us with our weight sink the whole nation: It made
Deucalion, willing for to die,
When he had all the world, in company,


Let CHARLES be first be made away, by poison, or secretly strangled, that we
may be revenged before we die, but see where the Ghosts of Strafford, Laud,
Tomkins, Challoner, Bourcher, Burleigh, and an infinite number of other
Innocents whom we cruelly murdered, stand waiting to drag us into Phlegeton.

We come, we come, having received our hire,
On earth, to plunge in hell, in liquid fire.
FINIS.
