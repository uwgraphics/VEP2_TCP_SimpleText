THE RAT -- TRAP: OR, The IESVITES taken in their own Net, etc.

Discovered in this year of Jubilee, or Deliverance from the Romish faction;
1641.



Imprinted 1641.

The Rat-Trap: OR, The Jesuits taken in their own Net, etc.
THe first institution of the Jesuiticall Order, was by the Father of that Sect
Ignatius Loyola, not granted at the beginning thereof without great pretense of
Sanctity, and religious piety, as professing and protesting to imitate Jesus
himself (whose cognizance they seem to carry) both in his Life and Doctrine:
But these Wolves having crept into the Church in Sheeps clothing, and admitted
into the Flock, not able to bridle or restrain their bloody and savage
natures, have not only preyd upon them whom they pretended to protect, but
also by insinuating into the humors and dispositions of the most powerful
Potentates, have insidiated both their lives and fortunes, as by diverse
pregnent, (but prodigious) demonstrations may appear: being grown to be the
most cunning Engineers, politic underminers, subtle supplanters, and
dangerous incendiaries of any order, quality, or condition, or any faction
spiritual or temporal whatsoever.

Of whom to make a more general discovery: They first, skrew themselves into
the hearts and thoughts of Princes, villifying unto them all other Sects and
Orders, the better to prefer and dignifie their own; by which crafty means
they have inpatronized themselves into the best Abbyes, Monasteries, and other
Cloystered and sequestered places of Religion; and by the supplantation of
others interessed, and inherited themselves: by which means growing rich and
eminent, they may the better manage all their politic proceedings; the manner
whereof follows.

In Rome lives their Father general, to whom the inferior sort (called his
assistance) tender due obedience, and these are imployd through all the parts
of Christendom, and bear the names of the places in which they recide, as the
assistance of Spain, of France, of Italy, England, etc. who by means of their
correspondents, who disperse themselves into the principal Cities of that
Province, first inform themselves of the state, condition, and quality of that
Kingdom, and inform the assistants of all passages and occurrants, of which
they give notice to the Father general at Rome, who curiously examining them,
and conferring them together, at last conclude to favor the affairs of one
Prince, and depresse the designs of another, as shall best correspond with
their own pleasure; and profit, being most preposterous and almost against
Reason, that these pure Professors, should only intend, and interesse
themselves in matters of State, for rain from their Oath and Order, and in the
mean time carelessely neglect both the saving of their own souls, and others
committed to their charge, for which the foundation of their society, and
brotherhood, was at the first authorized.

It is apparent to all men, that they are Confessors to the greatest part of
the Nobility through all the Roman Catholic estates, not without great
prejudice to the Princes themselves) to which office they were also to them
admitted, by which they penetrate into every design and purpose, of which they
give intelligence to their further general; and as secrefie is the sole
preservation of a State, without which it is not able to subsist; and that
Princes themselves punish with the greatest vigor such as discover their
Counsels (as the greatest enemies both to their own Principality, and the
safety of their Kingdom) yet the Jesuits by their Confessions, and
Consultations, which their correspondents have, being planted in the chief
Cities of the Christian world, are sincerely, and punctually advertised of all
determinations concluded in their most secret Cabinets and Closets; so that
they better know the power, possessions, expenses, and private projects of
Princes, than themselves, suppressing or advancing their affairs at their
pleasures; which they may easily do, by reason that by their auricular
Confessions, they penetrate even to the very secrets of their souls; by which
means the secrets of State being discovered, breeds sometimes a jealousy in
Princes of, their best and most faithful Servants, and Officers, not without
the great prejudice both of the King and Subject, and indangering the whole
state of the Kingdom.

And to continue their stratagems, the better these Jesuiticall Machiavells
distinguish themselves into four ranks or degrees: the first consists of
secular or lay-persons, who are joined to their fraternity, and submit
themselves wholly to their power and patronage; and these are for the most part
of the prime Gentry, of both Sexes, wealthy widows, Citizens, and Merchants;
from whom by their flattery and insinuations they draw rich donatives,
persuading from some annual pensions; and others to forsake the world, and
leave all their revenues, movables, coin, and jewels, to enrich their
ingurgitating Monasteries, persuading them that it will prove meritorious for
the health of their souls, whilst they with these profits; Feast, and fat
their own bodies. A second sort consists of men only, and these as well of
Priests, as Laymen; such as profess a sequestered, life and retired, capable
of Church preferments, but with a vow to take upon them the habit, whenever
it shall please the Father general to call them unto it; and such are called
Jesuits in voto.

The third are those that live in Cloisters and Monasteries, and these are
either Priests, Clerks, or Converts, who because they were not original of
that profession, may by the authority of the Father general, be deprived and
degraded (though they before have tied themselves to keep it by oath) and these
not being as yet called to Office, are subject in all things to the
superintendents command. The fourth, are the prime politic Jesuits, through
whose hands passes all the government of Religion, who labor to reduce their
society to an absolute Monarchy, and to plant and settle the head thereof in
Rome, (where all the affairs of the Christian world meet together) as in a
center, that being also the seat of the Father general, and diverse of his
agents, who are daily admitted into the houses of Embissadors and Courts of
Cardinals; by which means they preoccupate the affairs of forra ine Princes;
that notwithstanding the importunity of their Ambassadors and agents, nothing
can be there determined, or concluded of, which stands not with their pleasure,
and redounds not to their profit; by which they are grown to that pride and
arrogancy, that they have publicly boasted, that they can make Cardinals,
Nuntioes; and in temporal affairs, Lieutenants, Praefects, and Governors;
that their General in these times have more power than the Pope himself;
adding, that it is better, and much more noble to make Cardinals, than to be a
Cardinal.

And for their avarice, and greedy accumulating of wealth and riches, they are
so far from obeying the Cannon which enjoynes them to humility, integrity,
and austerity of life: but they engage themselves into all temporal affairs,
to the great distaste and detriment of most of the Romish Kings and Princes;
and further, make Merchandise of Pearls, Rubies, Emeralds, Diamonds, and all
stones of estimation and value, which they trade in from the Indies, and else
where, that there is an opinion through Italy, that the greatest part of them
that are sold in Venice are the proper goods and commodities of those Jesuits,
the ground of which opinion has been received from their own Brokers, who
have had the sale of them. But to rip up all their juglings, legerdemaines,
stratagemeticall plots, and combustions in state, which would ask a voluminous
Tract, I shall entreat the Reader to satisfy himself for the present with
this compendious and brief Preface: only my purpose being in the next place
to discover them not only for bloody Butchers, but most rigorous regicides;
their damnable plots and practices, (deserving the hatred and detestation of
all men) which I shall strive to do by some few examples; and if the Tree may
be judged of by the fruit, we shall easily see what these Jesuits are.

To begin with France, Henry the third of that name, after he had for their
many murders, and massacres of the Protestants, and withal their insufferable
insolence to him, caused the two brother Guizes, the Duke and Cardinal to be
slain at Chartres; after being reconciled to the Protestant King of Navarr,
and marching to beleaguer his rebellious Subjects in Paris, being at a place
called St. Clawds, he was most traitorously stabbed with a knife in the
bottom of the belly, by a Friar of the Order of Iacobin, set on by the
Jesuits, of which wound he dyed the next day following in the midst of his
Army.

And his successor, first King of Navarre, and after of France, for his many
noble victories styled Henry the great, having subdued Champaigne, and all
Picardie, in his return to Paris was stabbed in the face with a knife also, by
a young desperate Student, whose name was John Chastell, instigated and set on
by the former faction; for which preditorious fact he was deservedly torn to
pieces with wild horses, the twenty ninth of December, but the King by Gods
preservation was recovered of that hurt: For which he instituted Knights of
the Order of the Holy Ghost, in January, being the year of grace one thousand
five hundred ninety five: but this traiterous violence offered him was but the
presage of a future, but more fatal disaster.

For this potent King, the next day after he had seen his Queen most
magnificently crowned at St. Denis, upon friday being the foureteenth of May,
and in the year 1610. about four of Clock in the afternoon, was murdered
in his Coach by two stabs with a knife, passing the street called Ferroneny (by
one Francis Ravillack born in Angolisme) which happened after he had lived
six and fifty years, and one and thirty days, having reigned in Navarre
thirty seven years and eleven months, or thereabouts, and in France twenty
years, nine months, and thirteen days: but the Traitors death, because it
was so remarkable give me leave a little to insist.

He was by profession a Lawyer; and by the conjecture of all men, was spurred
on to perpetrate this horrible act by the Jesuits: though all which he openly
confessed was, that what he did was by the instigation of the Devil; and his
reason, because the King tolerated within his Kingdom two Religions; the
manner of his death was as follows, after being rackt, and enduring several
sorts of torments in prison, he was brought thence in his shirt, with a Torch
of two pound weight lighted in his one hand, and the Knife with which he had
murdered the King chained to the other, and then set upright in a Dung-cart,
the people ready to tear him in pieces, had not the Officers restrained them;
thence he was brought to the Scaffold, where he crossed himself, to show he dyed
a Papist: he was next bound to a St. Andrews Cross, and his hand chained to
the knife burnt in a furnace of fire and brimstone, yet would confess nothing,
only lamentably roared, but by none pitied.

Then was his flesh pulled off with hot burning pincers, and oil, rosin, pitch
and brimstone powered into his wounds, and on his navell clapped a roundle of
clay, into which was powered molten lead; at the last his body was torn in
pieces with four strong horses, which were not able to pluck his sinewy limbs
asunder, till the flesh under his arms and thighs was cut, and then was he
totally dis-membred, then were his limbs burnt to ashes, and cast into the
wind, his goods confiscate to the King, the house in which he was borne
utterly demolished, and made even with the earth, never any structure to be
built there after, and his father and mother to depart the Realm, never more
to return upon the penalty of being hanged, and that his brethren, sisters,
unckles, and all of the name, should upon the same forthwith change their names
to some other, so that Ravillack should not be so much as spoken through the
Realm. And so much of this Jesuitical Arch-Traytor to the terrifying of others.

The like (in the Low Countries) was attempted and committed upon the person of
that renowned Protestant Prince William of Nassaw Prince of Orange, where a
bloody villain, through his own cloak a wainscot door, with a pistol double
charged, shot to death in his own palace, confessing at his most torturous
death, in the midst of torments, that (saving Ravillacks) wanted example;
that he was animated and encited to that bloody facinorous enterprise by the
continual instigation of the Jesuitical faction.

The Jesuits plots discovered, which they have been about this ten or eleven
years, worse than that of the Gunpowder Treason.
IN the year of Grace, one thousand six hundred twenty nine, at Salamanca an
University in Spain (by the consent of their Father general at Rome) there
was an assembly of the Jesuitical Society, (who called themselves the holy
Synod) in which one grave Seignior, who was the Prolocutor, began as follows:
Dear brothers of the most Sacred Order, we being here convented this day
(being the birth day of our Father and Founder (of ever-living memory) Ignatius
Loyalla) it is fit that we consult and determine of some affairs, that may
tend to the strengthening of our power, the advance of our reputations, and the
enriching of our coffers, (at which there was a general hum through the Table)
when he proceeded: But as I have proposed you a thing fit to be done, so
there ought means to be devised and found, how it may be accomplished: the
course it self, of which I have maturely deliberated, and in which I crave the
assistance of your counsel, is by setting England and Scotland (Nations that
have too long lived in fraternall love and amity) at odds, or to use the
Scottish phrase, at Deadly Feud: which best how to bring to pass, I solicit
you to deliver you sundry censures.

All of them unanimously applauding the matter, now began singly to speak
their opinions of the manner: says one, I think it may be done by some new
plot and practice of treason: says another, I suppose rather by sowing some
seditious libels amongst them, to make one Nation jealous of the other: a third
replied, to invade one of the Kingdoms by sea, to which purpose they would
solicit the Catholic Princes to join in a solemn combination: but a fourth
cut him off and said, I like not these attempts by sea, since the bad success
and utter overthrow of the great Armado in Eighty eight, though it had the
Popes blessing along, and was by his Holiness styled Invincible. O but, said
the Prolocutour, the reason of that may be easily given, for the sins of the
Land were not then ripe, which since are grown to full maturity: But had it
then prevailed, with our pistols and ponyards, steeletto's and knives, whips,
fire, and faggots, we would have made them taste of that Purgatory here on
earth, which they will not believe to have place in any corner of Hell.

But to leave others, let me now acquaint you with a project of mine own,
that I think wants president; for policy has prevailed, where puissance has
been repulst, and fraud has entered, where force could not: for Ulysses did
more in his Tent, then Ajax did in the field. At this all their ears were
pricked up in attention, when he spoke on as follows; The King of Spain is
styled the most Catholic, the King of France the most Christian King, and the
King of England is titled, Defender of the Faith, having under his Dominion
three Kingdoms, England, Scotland, and Ireland; the first Protestants, the
second Puritans, the third Papists. Now in this distraction of religions, how
easy is it to raise troubles and tumults? Now we have Jesuits in voto,
ingenious and active, and fit to be employed in these deep and mystical
designs.

Now if you ask me the manner how? they are to be sent over, and dispersed into
the Courts and families of Noblemen, and places bought them, or offices in
which they may gain the best intelligence, by screwing themselves into the
bosoms, as well of the noble as ignoble rank: now if you object and say, this
cannot be without charge, and great disbursments of money? I answer, have we
not Collectors, Receivers, and Treasurers to that purpose, employed in several
parts of Christendom: as M. L. the Goldsmith in Fleet Street for the parts of
Flaunders; M. and D. for France; Mr. Borrowes for Spain, and others elsewhere?
(these of the English Nation only) and them our penetrating and insinuating
Agents and Ministers, being so planted and placed near about the Prince, and
principal persons of those three Kingdoms, they may take their opportunity,
and catching occasion by the fore-lock, find several tools and engines to
work with, as to incense the Papists (with whom our Society is most embraced)
against the Puritans, and set them and other Separatists against the Papists,
and both against the Protestants, to bring in new Innovations into the Churches
of England and Scotland, such as we know the most distaste, and can worst
digest; to alter their ancient Liturgy, by inserting new additions into their
books of Common prayer, and by admitting into Church livings, none but such as
can conform themselves to all such Tenants as shake hands with the Romish
Traditions and Doctrines; and to thrust out of their Benefices, all such as
stand stiff for the Reformed Religion, but especially to thrust in Ceremonies
(such as they call Superstitions) Altars, and the like, into the Scottish Kirk,
which Nation we know to be perverse, obstinate, and impatient of any Innovation
or change, especially in their Religion.

Thus wanting power to conquer their Countries, let it be our practice to
undermine and blow up their consciences, ruinating them in their distraction
about Religion; for what will not men or women hazard, even goods, lands, nay
life it self too for their Religion; for what is more dear or nearer to a
Christian than his God and his Religion? what will cause more dissension, than
not to have freedom of their Religion? Nay, the very Turk himself will not
fear to dye, though a pseudo-Martyr, even by torments or tortures, ere he can
be compelled to forsake his Mahomet. Now we knowing the Protestant so constant
in his Religion, that he will suffer no alteration, the Papist so selfe-will'd
he will brook no reformation, and the Puritan so obstinate he will endure no
Innovation, and all these spurred on by our subtle Agents animation: what
seditions, what suspicions, what commotions, what combustions are probable to
ensue thereof; but by this Incendiary kindled in their Kingdoms, Ireland may
grow tumultuous, Scotland combustions, and take arms, and Englands peace be
altogether disturbed and disquieted at least, to the exhausting of their
treasure, if not their bloods, to their great detriment, if not their general
desolation: and in these jealousies and troubles, to bring in foreign Forces,
there would be some hope to attain our ends. Which speech being gravely
delivered, was by the rest greatly applauded, and the Assembly dissolved, with
a determinate resolution to put all the former projects in speedy practice with
an Et caetera.

But to come near to our own Country, what miraculous deliverances had Queen
El^zabeth (of ever blessed memory) from the plots and underminings of those
Arch Jesuitical Regecides? During her minority, in the reign of her sister,
what projects and stratagems were devised to insidiate her life; her sundry
commitments and impris^nments? nay, a warrant for her death (...) by the
Queen, at the animation of (...) Clergy? Her damage by water, when her barge
at a low ebb grated upon the arches of the Bridge, when she was sent a
prisoner to the Tower? by fire, when her lodgings were burnt over her head,
during her confinement at Woodstock. In the beginning of her reign, what
complotting by the Jesuits of Spain, France, and Italy, to supplant her from
her true and lawful inheritance, by discharging her Subjects from their
loyalty and obedience?

Troubles also were raised in her Kingdom of Ireland by one Nicolas Saunders, a
pestilent Traitor, and one of that seditious Order, whose pen and tongue
spared not only maliciously to calumniate the Queen her self, but the Lady
Anne Bulleine her mother, who having purchased a consecrated Banner with power
Legantine, landed amongst the Rebels, whither was sent also S. Josephus with an
army of Italians and Spaniards, to join with the revolted Earl of Desmond,
his brother Fitz Morris, and others: but their army was soon distressed, the
Earl dyed wretchedly, and Saunders fell mad, and dies starved in the cliffes
of an almost unaccessible mountain. The like machinations were devised against
her by Cardinal Allen, Englefield, and Rosse, as also by Doctor Parry, by
travel Hispanisied, Italionated, and fully Iesuitified, who after his return,
when the Queens Majysty vouchsafe him her gracious presence in her garden,
came armed with a Pistol to have taken away her life, had he not been
miraculiously prevented, for which horrible Treason he was soon after drawn
hanged and quartered.

The horrible Treason of the f ourteene Traitors began in one Savage a Bastard;
but Instigate thereunto by two Priests, Gilbert Gifford and one Hudson, and the
rest of the conspirators drawn in by Ballard the Priest and Jesuit who with
the other guilty of the same treason against her majesty's own person, the
twentieth of September in Lincolnes Inn fields upon a public Scaffold were
hanged and quartered; diverse others suffered at Tiburne; the prime of which and
of most note, were father Campion, and master Soothwell who during his
Imprisonment in the tower writ two excellent poems; the on (...) led Saint
Peter's complaint, the other Magdalens tears, for seducing her Majesty's
subjects and denying the supremacy.

I will conclude all the Iesuitical Treasons against her (and those by her own
Subjects,) which that as Edward Squire are belonging to the Queens stable, who
being in Spain was persuaded and seduced from his allegiance by one Walpoole
a revolted runnagate, and entered into the Jesuitical order (one of these
before named Invato,) who gave a mortiserous confection in a bladder, to poison
the pummell of her saddle, who after his return into England attending his
opportunity, one day when her Majesty was to take horse, came openly with a
smiling countenance in the presence of many, and having pricked the bladder, and
wearing a thick tand glove for his own security, chapt his hand upon the
pummell of the saddle, and with a loud and cheerful voice said God save the
Queen: but it pleased God out of his merciful providence, to take his word
not his meaning; for neither mounting, nor alighting, nor all the way she
road, (wearing a thin glove) she once laid her hand upon the pummell? but
the Treason being after discovered, he by his own conviction was convicted
and condemned.

To come nearer to the days of Royal King James her successor, whose
Coronation by reason of the great sickness in and about London then reigning,
being deferrd, in this Interim two Italionated Jesuit Priests whose names
were Watson and Clark, lays a plot to surprise the person of King James and
Prince Henry, and to compel them to subscribe two things to their own
puposticall ends, and further had drawn into this conspiracy Henry Brook, Lord
Cobham, and Lord Warden of the Cinque ports. Thomas Lord Gray of Wilton, Sir
Walter Raliegh Lord Warden of the Staneries. Sir Griffin Markham, Sir Edward
Parham, George Brook brother to the Lord Cobham and Bartlemew Brooksby: whom
these Jesuits had persuaded by their sophistical arguments that the attempt
could be no Treason, being done before the Kings Coronation, alleging that
Saul was not King till he was chosen in Mispeh, though he had bin maintained in
Ramah by Samuel the Prophet, neither Jeroboam, who in the days of Samuel had
been confirmed by the Prophet to reign over Israel til the people made him
King upon the foolish answer of Rehoboam, but yet notwithstanding all their
syllogisticall Flourishers, it was proved unto them (to their costs,) That in
England there is no Interregum, because the King never dies, and that the
Coronation is but a ceremony to show the Prince to the people, for which only
there dyed (which was the Kings great mercy) the two Iesnits Watson and Clarke,
the twenty ninth of November, and George Brooks, upon the first of December
next ensuing.

But that Damnable and Diabollicall plot of the Gunpowder arch-Treason,
exceeds all president or example, the like from the beginning of time not
read or heard: hatched in the Jesuitical nest of that most bloody Brotherhood,
which because it is yearly remembered in every Pulpet almost through the
Kingdom, I spare further to aggravate, only to put the reader in mind that no
such execrable act could be put in agitation without a Jesuit to prompt and
further it: witness Father Garnet an arch provincial Priest of that murder, who
as the rest of those conspiratours in that satannical Conjuration dyed the
death of a Traitor being drawn, hanged, and quartered.

Now to descend as low as the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King Charles, even
but yesterday, since the beginning of this now hopeful Parliament, one John
James a Kentish man a Jesuitical Romist, thinking now by a pretended madness
to color his notorious mischief, in Westminsterhall, in the very face of the
Judicial Courts, with a rusty dagger, stabbed Justice Heywood, as he was going
to the parliament house to deliver up a catalog of diverse papists and Jesuits
names which inhabited in or about Westminster, who being commanded, and
according to his office, to give notice thereof, for the good of his king and
Country, was violently (as I said before) assaulted and stabbed in the side,
thinking to have deprived him of his life, which God be thanked, proved
otherwise, and this was by the Jesuitical faction held a meritorious act: Thus
does these Jesuits still persist in their malice and spleen against King and
State, contriving and plotting mischief even upon their beds, for their study
is only for blood, their Religion is Rebellion, their treaties are only
treacheries, their plots are only powder-plots, their matches are only to
out-match us, even by gunpowder and match, their policies are pestilences,
their union is only tending to a disunion, and their devotions are cozening
devotions. They will by their power depose Emperors, and kill Kings, stab and
poison princes; for how many princes have suffered by and thorough their
divellish and inhumane murders and conspiracies. It was surely one of their
plots to urge our Bishops to make those new Cannons, and to put in the word Et
caetera, that they might be heard to roar like a Bull as far as Rome, and
all these devices are covered with a cloak of religion, even with a long
cloak of knavery reaching down to their heels.

These are but a few amongst many, and ere I proceed any further, I must
entreat the indifferent and unpartiall Reader, to take some things necessary
into his consideration. First how the adversaries spare not both in their words
and writings bitterly to asperse and condemn the severity of the Laws, for
the cutting of such pestilent and preditorious Malefactors, as if they alone
were all conscience and Christianity, libellously traducing them, as if they
were like Braccoas (the Legislator amongst the Athenians) writ in blood,
pretending ours to be a mere usurped power, no better than Tyranny, whom
their bloody and merciless persecutions, they strive to mittigate and extenuat
by the countenance and authority of the Church, and Apostolical Jurisdiction,
when Christ himself left as his last Legacy upon earth, his peace amongst
them; when the Apostles never assumed to themselves any Pontifical state and
habit, but were Preachers and teachers of the Word: when all their successors
in the Primitive Church were so far from being persecutors, that themselves
patiently suffered persecution and Martyrdom for the Gospel sake: when the
Papisticall prelates of these times; instigated and spurd on by their
Jesuitical Engineeres, instead of Prayer, Fasting, Exhortation, Admonition,
and pious instruction, deal altogether in Fire and Faggot Daggers, Pistolls,
powder-plots, and the like, excluding all mercy and charity, so they can but
add the least Mite to their Papal Monarchy.

When on the contrary our Laws stretch no further than to punish runnagates
and revolters of our own Nation; such as being borne natural subjects
renounce their allegiance to their lawful Prince and Sovereign, transplanting
themselves into other Countries, acknowledging foreign supreams, denying that
supremacy of their own natural Liege, refusing to subscribe to the oath of
allegiance; and not herewith contented, they most traitorously seek to seduce
and alienate the hearts of the subjects from their religion, faith, and
obedience, in contempt of the Laws, which in duty and conscience by the Laws
of Nations, they are bound to observe. Nor are these just punishments inflicted
upon their capitol delinquencies, without giving them warning to fly and
abandon the Realm: but upon their peremptory and wilful return in despite
of Proclamation, and mere contempt both of prerogative and Parlamentall
authority they as it were dare justice, and in their selfe-wild obstinacy
thrust themselves into the hands of the hangman, as if they were borne
hereditary to the halter.

For instance, (and which is now at this present in agitation) one John
Goodman, a Priest and Jesuit, notwithstanding all former caveats and
premonitions, having the libery of the whole world to retire and solace
himself, only he was banished and debarred this land nine years since, the
entrance into which he knew no less than the forfeiture of his life, with a
shameful death annexed, and knowing withal, how hateful the nama of a Romish,
Priest, was to all the true and faithful subjects of the kingdom, yet maugre
all interdiction and proclamations forbidding the contrary, desperately, (if
not madly) exposed himself unto all the p enalty and dangers of the law, and
being taken, and in the Newgate: and iron shackle on hi^ leg
Rat-trap held by the leg, for fear of slipping away, and brought unto his
trial, having all the favor that could be shown to a Malefactor in that
kind, by his own free and voluntary confession accused and condemned himself,
and when judgment must of necessity (as in all such cases) be, and was
pronounced against him, yet the Kings Majesty out of his great and unbounded
clemency and mercy, when he was ready to be drawn to execution, sent him a
Reprieve for his life: and since being delivered up unto the high Court of
Parliament, they, in hope of his reformation, and recantation, have not as yet
proceeded against his life; unto whose mercy I leave him, and with whom I
conclude this brief Tractate: Desiring with all the Reader to take further
into his consideration the lenity of our laws, and the mild proceedings
therein to spare Christian blood: when on the contrary, our adversaries with
their Corrigidoes and Catchpooles, thirst nothing more after: when no Lay
Protestant traveller in Rome or Spain, dares so much as hold argument of his
own Faith, or show a book in his own Language, but he shall be hurried into
the bloody Inquisition; to endure more tortures and pains than in their own
devised purgatory, the miseries and torments whereof, if any would be further
satisfied, let them but read the lamentable sufferings of Mr. Lythgow, amply
set down in the book of his Travells.

FINIS.
