Then the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress
it and to keep it, Genesis 1.27, 28. By W. S.

Printed in the Year 1679.

TO THE READER.
Friend,
MY chief end and aim in this small Treatise concerning Thoughts, etc. is, that
thou may be informed how to attain unto that Primitive As thou come into
the Image of God again, thou will subdue the earthly image, have dominion over
thy own thoughts, government over thy will desire, and affections: This is the
Primitive power Mankind was endued withal; for the nature of the whole Creation
is in Man; and he that has perfect dominion or rule over himself, all things
else are under his feet; where this is wanting disorder and confusion abounds,
being subject to that Spirit that leads even nature it self out of course. Genesis
1.27, 28.
Wisdom, Power, and Dominion, which Mankind had, before Transgression entered
the World; wherein he did, and could subdue the Earth, have Dominion over it,
and over all the Creatures God had made, moving upon the face of the Earth, in
the Air and Water also; and and give them all Names according to their Nature,
and to dress and keep the Garden according to the Command of God: for God never
commanded any thing (as Man's Duty) that was impossible; he had Wisdom and
Power given to him to observe and obey whatsoever was enjoined him; the Serpent
could not force or compel, though he could entice and allure; yet till he was
yielded to, till consent through deceiveableness of the Bait, begot a vain hope
to better his estate, till he gave way to foolish Thoughts and Consultations,
he kept his Innocence, Place, and Habitation in Paradise: But when he entered
into the Temptation, he went forward into a multitude of Thoughts and
Inventions, till he was driven to the greatest distance from God; in which
state he does and will remain, till he come to embrace the hand that smites
him, and obey that voice that calls unto him in the cool of the day, To believe
and obey the Spirit of God which he has sent into the world, placed in men's
hearts, which convinces and reproves for Sin, is the only way and means which
God has ordained for the restoration, life, and salvation of Mankind, and is
indeed the Christ of God, which in Scripture has many names, but is but one
pure eternal holy thing.
and to learn of that Spirit that reproves him, and convinces him of Sin, and
makes him afraid to see the face of God, because he has Transgressed his Law,
and broken his Holy Commandments: and until he comes to believe, that he that
wounds must heal, he that calls to account for evil doing, must save from it,
and that the Reproofs of Instruction is the way to life, and that to be slain
with the Flaming Sword that turns every way to guard the Tree of Life, is the
way to live again: And that through the Spirit of Judgment and burning,
Redemption, Salvation, Restoration and Everlasting Felicity is again to be
come unto* and the Spirit of DisObedience that took Life by obeying the
Serpent, must come to Death, must be Mortified, Slain and Buried out of sight
also, in all his Thoughts, Imaginations, Inventions, Willing, Running,
Comprehending; in all his Wisdom, Knowledge, Prudence, and Understanding also:
these must all be stopped, bowed under, and confounded, or brought to naught,
before he can enter into rest again, or know what the Sabbath of the Lord is,
which the outward Sabbath was a sign of.

Mankind is never safe while he is his own keeper, while he is willing,
running, and working for himself; while he is guided and led by his own Will,
Mind, Knowledge, Wisdom, Prudence, and Understanding; he is never at quiet,
never content and satisfied, never at rest, being gone from the Fountain of
Living Water, though he labors and toils to hew out Cisterns that he thinks
may supply his want; yet they prove so broken, that they will hold no water, no
refreshment for his Soul, no satisfaction nor content for his mind, though he
toil and dig in the earth, and search the dark corners thereof: And though in
his thoughts and imaginations he ascends up into Heaven, and makes his Nests
among the Stars, his labor is all vain and fruitless, when the day of shaking
comes, when the melting of the Elements come, all proves but as a bed too
short, and as a covering too narrow, and as one that walks by the light of his
own sparks, and warms himself by the fire of his own kindling, but in the end
lies down in sorrow. All these things thou who art a Child of Light, and of the
day, understandest right well; therefore art thou made willing in the day of
God's power to die to thy self daily, to give up and resign thy self to the
daily Cross, While men live in the flesh, they cannot please God; but its
possible to be dead thereto and live in the Spirit on this side the Grave
till thou do become dead, crucified, and buried also; till which, thou
cannot avoid thinking thy own thoughts, speaking thy own words, and doing thy
own works, and following thy own will, thoughts, and inventions, from which
sprang thy misery, and in which it continues, so long as thou art alive in thy
self, and at home in the body, thou art really dead and absent from the Lord.

For it is only those that are dead and suffer with Christ that come to know a
living and reigning with him, over all worldly Rudiments, over all carnal
Ordinances, over all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, over all Principalities
and Powers, and Spiritual Wickednesses in high places; over all Thoughts and
Imaginations, over all Desire, Will and Affection; these are they that arise
and ascend with him up unto the Father, and that sits down in heavenly places
with him, at the right hand of God, and that have converse in Heaven, talks
with God as a man talks with his Friend, he holds his Face with Joy and great
Delight. As thou come hither, thou art come into the Restoration indeed,
thou have found that which was lost indeed; thou art come from the East, West,
North, and South, and sat down in the Kingdom with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
indeed, and art ceased from thy own works as God did from his, and art entered
into the blessed rest that God has prepared; all which is possible to him that
believes.

Therefore let none put the good and evil day afar off, for the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand, and many are living witnesses of the coming of it, and do
enjoy Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost, in which the Kingdom
stands. And God is Omnipresent, and those that enjoy the Light of his
Countenance, dwell in Heaven, and are within the Gates thereof; which though
they stand open, no unclean thing can enter.

A Small TREATISE Concerning Thoughts and Imaginations.
EVil Thoughts and Imaginations, are great troublers of the World of Mankind;
and it is a great plague and misery which man is accompanied and surrounded
with, who is given up to follow and obey his own evil Thoughts and
Imaginations; or to walk according to them: It was a fore judgment pronounced
against the disobedient rebellious Jews, in the Word of the Lord by Jeremy,
saying, Hear O earth, behold I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit
of their thoughts. And the Lord by the Prophet Isaiah says, I have stretched
out my hand all day to a rebellious people which walked in a way that was not
good, after their own thoughts, which are thoughts of iniquity, and the act of
violence is in their hands. Also it is written, Every thought and imagination of
man's heart are only evil, and that continually. And very great is the misery,
bondage, and slavery of mankind in this estate; he is an enemy to God, and to
himself, and to his Neighbor and Brother, Wasting and destruction are in their
paths, who have not God in all their thoughts.

Now reader, that which is principally on my mind, is, to set before thee a
certain infallible way, how thou may come to be saved from following or
obeying thy own thoughts, and to gain strength against, and get victory over
all thy imaginations that are evil; and also how thou may attain to good
thoughts, and heavenly Meditations in the room thereof; and how thou may
come to know every good thought, and desire, brought into the obedience of
Christ, and every evil thought and imagination destroyed, and consumed with the
breath of his mouth, and the brightness of his appearing. And when thou art
restored and brought into the same estate mankind was in before transgression,
Evil thoughts must be consumed, and good thoughts must be subject and obedient
to Christ.
even into the Garden of God, how thou must then dress and keep the Garden.
Thou must then watch over, and in the Wisdom and Power of God, govern thy
thoughts, lest the Serpent beguile thee as he did Eve.

First, Thou must understand that Many in their carnal thoughts and
imaginations conceive and affirm that it was the outward Earth God cursed, and
that it would have brought forth no briars, thorns, nor thistles (which are
good Creatures in their places) if man had not sinned, such thoughts are vain
and foolish; for all Creatures of God are good, the Fire and Air, Earth and
Water, Sun, Moon, and Stars, and all the product of them, and they all stand
and remain in the blessing, and keep their place, state, and order according to
the will of God, and are obedient unto him, and he is the upholder thereof by
the word of his power.
the ground evil thoughts and imaginations arise from, is now that which God in
the beginning cursed: from this ground spring all the Briars, Thorns, and
Thistles, and other hurtful Weeds in the world of mankind, in whose heart they
began to spring, grow, and increase, even so soon as he began to lose his Faith
in God his Maker, and incline to hearken to the voice of the Serpent, and give
credit to his lies, which begot a vain thought; from whence a false hope
sprung, that they should by eating the forbidden fruit better their conditions,
be as Gods, according as the Serpent told the Woman (the weaker Vessel) and by
this false hope, grounded upon the thoughts and imaginations, entered the first
transgression; then when the temptation was entered into, and sin committed
thoughts and imaginations began to multiply and fill the disobedient earthly
heart of mankind; who having now turned his back upon the heavenly, slighten
the voice and command of God, who was his Teacher and Lawgiver, and How man
lost his state at first. Let those that are restored thereto again, take
warning thereby, for the same temptation and danger attends.
lent his ear to the wicked one, and gave up his mind and heart to obey him,
even with thoughts it was all for the best. Thus poor mankind being deceived
with vain thoughts, and false hope, lost his habitation and dewlling place in
Paradise; which after he had transgressed, he still thought to keep; for he was
soon convinced he had done amiss in cating the forbidden Fruit; and fear
possessed his heart, when he heard the voice of God in the cool of the day, and
therefore sought means to cover and hide himself from the sight of God: but
herein his thoughts were vain, and his endeavors to no purpose; the Woman,
Man, and Serpent, all received the fruits of their own doings; nothing but
life, good and blessing were known before; now death evil, and cursing the
fruit and effect of disobedience, (which as I have said, entered first by giving
place to a vain thought and desire in Wicked men and sinners of these times and
ages of the world, propose not that end to themselves, the Devil needs not lay
such baits and snares to win them to his obedience, being such vassals to him,
that his motions and commands are sufficient.
hope to gain and better their estate) become the daily companions of mankind,
who found, and finds by woeful experience, that saying true, When sin is
finished it brings forth death.

So man having lost his place in the Garden which God planted, through
neglecting his work which God appointed him to do, which was to dress it, and
to keep it; for the Garden needed dressing and keeping before the sorbidden
Fruit was eaten, before Innocence was lost, before sin was committed, hefore
the Serpent became a Tempter, Devil, and Destroyer.

And this arises in my mind to teslifie to all the wise in heart, that after
they are come to find that which was lost, to witness a Restoration, and
Regeneration, and a returning into Eden again, into Innocence again, they have
work there to do, Dressing and Keeping are two very significant words: this was
the business of mankind in the beginning, in the state of Innocence; if he had
not neglected this work, slighted the Light, Power, Wisdom, and Glory of God,
with which he was replenished, he had never fell; when the temptation got into
a thought, if he had watched in the Light and Wisdom of God, he would have seen
and discovered the tendency of it, and have prevented its coming to a desire
and act: But first giving The beginning, increase, and progress of sin, and how
to stop and prevent it.
place to a selfish thought, it soon sprang to a hunger or desire, thence into
act, (this is the beginning and progress of sin at this day) which mankind in
Innocence had, and has power and wisdom from God to prevent, if he abide in
it, and keep in his watchtower, the light and strength of God, which is as
near him as the temptation can be, and sufficient to preserve him: and where
this work is neglected, men, yea, holy men fall, and sin after the similitude
of Adam's Trangression, and are beguiled as the Serpent did Eve, drawn out of
Innocence, and a sinless estate after they have attained unto it; therefore let
none be highminded, but fear, and take the second Adam for example, who when he
was tempted, did not hunger or desire after the things presented, though very
spacious in appearance, and accompanied with very large promises; even as the
first Adam had: but it is written, while the temptation lasted he eat nothing;
he let nothing in, gave no place to selfish thoughts, and enticements of the
enemy: so when the temptation was over, Angels ministered unto him: Let this be
the example of all the Children of Light, and as they do thereafter, the
powerful salvation of God shall surround them and neither heights nor depths,
Angels, Principalities, nor Powers, things presen, or things to come, shall be
able to separate them from the love of God in Christ Jesus. This is as a word
by the way.

Now evil thoughts and They are as the wings of the great red Dragon, who
troubles Heaven and Earth, Angels and Men.
imaginations are of a multiplying nature, and do mainly increase and take root
in the generality of mankind; who, through evil works are estranged from the
life of God, remaining a degenerate plant, sprang from the seed of the evil
doer, and dwells and labors in that ground which God has cursed, and knows
not the seed of the Woman to bruise the Serpents head, and to redeem and
preserve him from following and obeying his own thoughts and imaginations,
which are evil, and that continually. And indeed in that state can be no
otherwise, whether they lead into self-sinning, or self-righteousness, both are
an abomination to the Lord, and destructive to the well-being of mankind, both
temporal and eternal: for all the wickedness that has been brought forth and
acted in the world since the beginning, began or appeared first in the thought;
and the thought being cherished and joined to by the mind, will, and
understanding, it increased, and increases into words and actions. That which
is clean cannot proceed from that which is unclean; the heart of mankind in the
fall is universally corrupted, and desperate wicked; and, as has been said,
the thoughts and imaginations thereof are evil, and that continually: And
before it can be otherwise, there is an absolute necessity that every
particular man and woman must know and experience: for, and in themselves,
their hearts cleansed, purged, and purified, and created anew, the ground must
be made good, before the seed, the heavenly plant can grow, increase, and
flourish therein; before good thoughts, heavenly thoughts, and meditations can
arise, spring, and remain therein. And when this estate is known, witnessed;
and enjoyed, then to abide with him, dwell and walk with him, who has wrought
these mighty things in thee, and for thee, and in his wisdom and power to dress
and keep the Garden, the Heart, with all diligence, that that which would
defile enter not again, creep in again, as it did in the beginning (which is
possible.) Therefore what the Spirit of God put man upon in the beginning when
he was a noble plant in Eden, Man was to dress and keep the Garden before
Transgression entered; and when he comes to know sin and transgression finished,
or restoration into Innocence again, he must be exercised in the same work.
wholly a right Seed, viz. to dress and keep the Garden, so the Spirit of God
now in this age says to the Disciples thereof; Watch and pray, lest ye enter
into temptation; (take heed) lest as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplieity that is in
Christ.

Now this I testify from certain knowledge, that God has ordained means
whereby mankind, whose heart is so corrupted, that nothing that is good
proceeds out of it, neither any thing that is heavenly, and of God springs up
in it, that can live a moment, being so foul and so dark, (even like a foul
dark piece of earth outwardly, on which the Sun never shines, nor the rain
falls) that man in this miserable state may come to know and experienye his
foul heart cleansed, purged, and sanctified, as the Christians in the Primitive
times did; Though mankind may be in a state like unto dry bones scattered in a
Valley, without marrow and life, yet such may come to unit eagain, and finews
and flesh to come upon them, and to receive the breath of life, and to know God
also, whose work it is; who works mavelous things in the Earth, and in the
Heavens; as those who go down into the deeps behold.
Such were some of you, but now are you washed, cleansed, and sanctified, etc.
the fallow ground may be plowed up, and bear seed, and the wilderness may
become a fruitful field, and streams may break forth in the desare, and the
desert may come to rejoice, and to blossom as a Rose; crooked things may be
made straight, and rough places smooth; great heavy dark high Mountains may be
brought down and removed; yea, (melted at the presence of God) and the low
valleys may be ezalted; yea the wilderness may become like Eden, and the desert
like the garden of the Lord. All these mighty works and wonders has the Lord
wrought in this age, in and for a remnant, who are come to the fulfilling of
the Prophesies, are living witnesses of the same, and do in his Holy Spirit,
and Power, proclaim that the love and mercy of God toward lost man is
universal, and that his hand is stretched Fallen man cannot help himself,
therefore the eye of God pittieth him, and his hand is stretched out to help
him: he is only required to lay hold and depend upon the same, and it will
bring falvation to his house.
forth to help him out of the snare, pit, and deep dark dungeon, wherein he is
fallen; out of which he cannot by all his strength, wisdom, and invention help
himself; and so set him at liberty, that he may run the ways of his
Commandments with delight, and that he may come again to stand upright, as God
made man in the beginning; and lay aside all his thoughts and inventions
wherein he corrupted himself; and to bring him into such a state and condition,
that he may be able to do all things that are good, to think good thoughts,
speak good words, and do good works; and to eschew and avoid the contrary: this
to know and be able to do, is the one thing needful, wihtout which all men are
miserable, let their knowledge, wildom, and profession of Religion, Opinion,
and Invention be what it will.

Therefore my mind is in good will to mankind, having received knowledge and
understanding of the means God has ordained for the good and salvation of
mankind: And being something acquainted with the two great mysteries of
Godliness and Iniquity, and the way and working of each, to impart and signify
something of the same in a few words, to instruct and inform those to whom this
my testimony may come, how they may attain thereunto, and how they may come to
be rid of those troublesome companions, (viz.) Evil Thoughts and Imaginations
that do, may, or shall arise in their hearts, whila corrupted; and how the same
may be purified and made a holy habitation for God, as it was before sin
entered, before Innocence was lost, before the Serpent deceived the weaker
vessel, when all was good, yea very good.

The way that leads thereto, I affirm and declare to be as follows; and
whoever thou art that have a mind or desire to find that which is lost,
observe, believe, and receive what I say or write, as Truth; not received or
learned by Tradition, but by the experimental powerful work and operation of
the Spirit of Truth in my own Heart, Mind, and Conscience: and what I have
said, or shall say, is, and shall be according to the Holy Scriptures, and
witnessed to by them; for I cannot write contrary to them, being in unity with
them, and with the just men's spirits that wrote them. First then know thou, O
man, whoever thou art, and whatever thy thoughts and imaginations are, how far
soever thou art run into corruption, darkness, and degeneration from the state
of innocence, purity, and holiness; yet there is a measure of Divine Light
attends thee, though thou art darkness it-shines in thee, in order to show thee
thy way out of it; though thou art degenerated and run from God into the earth,
yet this pure light and Spirit of God follows thee, and calls thee back again;
and thou may in this state hear it as a voice behind thee, saying, Return,
return, this is the way, come and walk in it; this is the kindness and love of
God to thee in his Son, who is the light of the world, and lights every one
that comes thereinto; If men would hear and obey the voice of the Son of God,
Death, Hell nor the Grave could not hinder them from Salvation.
if thou hear and obey this voice of the light of the Son of God, though thou
were dead in sin, and buried as in a grave, thou shall arise and come forth,
and live before him; the bars and gates of Hell shall not be able to retain
thee: But if thou slight and despise the Light of God that visits thee, and
shut'st thy ear against its voice, it will be as a thousand witnesses against
thee, while thou rebellest against it, and art found following thy own thoughts
and imaginations, and doing the thing that is evil; for this Light I speak of,
is the eye of the Lord, that runs too and fro through the earth, beholding the
evil and the good, and that discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart;
it is the word that is nigh in mouth and in the heart, which is quick and
powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piereing even to the dividing
asunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the joints and marrow: this is the candle of
the Lord that searches Jerusalem, and gives light to the sides of the earth,
and corners of the world, from whom the shadow of death cannot hide, nor the
Rocks and Mountains cover or defend; for be that forms the Mountains, and
creates the winds, and declares or shows unto man what is his thought, that
makes the morning darkness, and treads upon the high places of the earth,
the Lord, the God of Hosts is his name. This is the Spirit of truth that
convinces the world of sin, and that sets men's sins in order before them, and
reproves and smites in secret for evil, and that brings to judgment the hidden
things of Esau; from this eye or light of the Lord thou can not hide thy self
no more than Adam and Cain could, though thou should hate the light (which
shows thee thy thoughts) and love the darkness so as to dwell in it, No
hiding from the eye of God.
yet the light or eye of God will pursue thee and find thee out; Hell nor the
utmost parts of the earth, and darkness cannot secure thee from the Man's
condemnation is just, because he hates the light, the way and means of
Salvation.
just condemnation of God; because thou hate the shining of his light, and
stopest thy ear against the voice and teaching of it, and love the darkness,
and dwellost in it, while thou do so, thou choosest the way of death, and
neglectest the means of salvation that God has ordained: for this is the
condemnation of the world, that light is come into it, and men love darkness
rather, because their deeds are evil.

Now as the first step toward restoration and everlasting happiness, thou art
required The first step in the way to life, or toward everlasting happiness.
to turn thy mind from the darkness in which thou dwell, to the light Eye or
Spirit of God, and to decline the power of Satan that works in the darkness,
and embrace the power of God; and when thou do but begin to do so, thou will
find the scales to fall from thy eyes by degrees, and the veil to be taken off
thy heart, and the setters and chains of darkness to be loosed, and the prison
doors opened; so when thy candle is lighted, and thy eye opened, thou will
discern thy way out, and see the Angel of the Lord go before thee, and guide
thee in the same: And thou will also perceive what is in thy house, and clearly
understand what has lodged in the dark room of thy heart, and when thou come
to see things as they are, Mistake in the understanding concerning the nature
of things that do present themselves before mankind, is the cause of error.
Thence it is that some call darkness light, and light darkness.
thou will receive wisdom, to give them names according to their nature, and to
judge righteously concerning them: and as thou love this light, thou will be
enabled by it to divide betwixt thought and thought, and begin to make
conscience of a thought, and to hate every vain thought; and when thou can
not be easily rid of them, nor remove them from their old lodging-place, thou will breath and cry to the Lord in the Spirit, as one of old did, who was
burdened and oppressed with their company: Search me and try me, O God, and
know my heart, try me and know my thougts, and see if there be any wicked way
in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. This is the cry which the Lord
hears, and will answer in due and needful time. And Jeremiah's cry to Jerusalem
was, Wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou may be saved, how long shall
thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? Now the only way to dislodge them, and to
be rid of their company, The way to be rid of evil thoughts and to see their
destruction.
is to show them no countenance, make no provision for them, give them no
entertainment, but by the light of God which discovers them to be thy enemies,
judge them, and keep thy mind exercised in the light and power of God, that it
is turned to; and not in thy thoughts, and imaginations, give them no regard:
and though they do and may arise, pursue and compass thee about like Bees, yet
thou keeping thy eye fixed in the light and power of God, which is as nigh thee
as thy thoughts are, and shows them unto thee, thou will see them in due time
scattered as chaff before a fierce wind, and destroyed as stubble before a
devouring fire.

Now as thou come to be a believer in the light, and to trust in the power of
God, to which thy mind is turned, thou will become in very deed a child of it,
and soon be able to say, darkness is past, and the true light now shines, by
which thou can see and judge every thought and motion that arises and
stirs in thy mind, whether evil or innocent, hurtful or harmless, and have
wisdom to order them accordingly. And this is that primitive wisdom mankind had
in the beginning, but he abode not in it, through looking at the temptation and
beauty of the thing presented to the eye of his mind, A dam's temptation was
inward and mysterious.
or through receiving from the Woman (for he was not deceived with the beauty
of an Apple, or some other outward fruit, nor by the talk and persuasion of any
creature; like our English Snakes, or the Devil in the shape of it, as vain man
in his carnal mind imagines when he reads the History thereof: but the
temptation was more mysterious and inward) the Woman was deceived in her
Thoughts; in her Judgment and Understanding was she beguiled before she obeyed
the Tempter, it appeared good for food, Genesis 3.6.
pleasant and desirable, and able to make one wise, before she eat, 1 Timothy
2.14. Romans 8.20.
or gave to her Husband. Paul says, the woman being deceived, was in the
trangression subjected to vanity; not willingly, but through hope; she hoped to
find the Serpents words true, and to become more wise, and more happy, by
taking the Serpents counsel; but instead thereof, fell into the depth of
misery: the same danger attends the Children of light, the Sons and Daughters
of God, (for Adam was a Son of God before Transgression) The Sons and Children
of God, of the light, and of the day are only capable to fall as Adam did; and
not the children of the Devil and Darkness; they are to be restored into
Innocence, into uprightness, before they are in danger to fall from it as Adam
did.
And it is only such who are in the restoration, children of the light, and of
the day, that are capable to fall as Adam and Eve did, and to sin after the
similitude of Adam's Transgression, and to lose innocence, purity, holiness and
uprightness as they did, (and be driven out of the Garden of God, as they
were.) Such as were never in it, nor ever dwelt in the state of restoration,
innocence, purity and holiness, cannot be said to fall from, or lose it, etc.
Children of Darkness, and children of the Devil, who have gone astray from that
womb, and always dwelt in darkness, end in the region and shadow of death,
never knew what a harmless innocent estate is, what the life of purity and
holiness is, nor what the simplicity of the Gospel and Christ is, so cannot be
beguiled as the Serpent did Eve, of that they never knew, nor had as men and
women now in the world) yet such are beguiled by the Serpent in another sort;
not of what they have had, and did once enjoy, but of what they might have and
should enjoy: And this he effects by keeping the eyes and minds of people
abroad, and by persuading them to follow any thing, The way and work of the
Devil to keep man in the fall, in the degeneration, in death and darkness,
slaves in his kingdom.
and walk in any way, rather than to turn the eye of their minds inward to the
Light, Word, Power, and Spirit of God, which shines, which speaks, which works
in man, in order to lead, to teach, to guide and direct him into the way of
life, and salvation, and to bring him into the glorious liberty of the Sons of
God, into a perfect translation from darkness to light, and from the Kingdom
and power of Satan, to the Kingdom and power of the Son of God, and to know
Christ made unto him Wisdom, Sanctification, and Redemption.

This is the blessed end of God in sending his Son a light into the world, The
precious love of God in sending his Son.
even to enlighten the Gentile, Jew, Professor, and Profane; and that through
him they might believe and receive eternal life, and enter into that blessed
rest that God has prepared, which the Primitive Christians who believed,
entered into; where they did not speak their own words, nor think their own
thoughts, nor do their own works, their heavenly Father spoke in them, and
their thoughts were thoughts of God, and he wrought all their works in them and
for them. This is a blessed state indeed, and none are entered into the rest
which God has prepared, but such as are come to witness and experience these
things now in this age, as the Primitive Christians did in ages past.

For while any are found thinking their own thoughts, speaking their own words,
and doing their own works (though under a profession of Christ and
Christianity) they cannot enter into the rest which God has prepared, though
they may create to themselves false rests, and kindle a fire, and walk by the
light of their own sparks, but in the end lie down in sorrow.

True rest and peace is obtained, or comes through a true self-denial: a dying
to self-sinning, and self-righteousness, self-thinking, and self-working,
contriving and inventing, self-wisdom, knowledge, and understanding also: all
these things must bedenied, annihilated or brought to nothing, and confounded:
the feeding upon these things occasioned, The seeding of the forbidden Fruit
which was good in it self, though not for food, occasioned, and occasioneth at
this day all the misery that attend monkind.
and occasioneth the Curse, add all the labor and turmoil, trouble, forrow,
and torment that has attended, and does attend mankind since the fall; to the
death must they all come before a sitting down in the Ringdom of God can be
witnessed, or before any can cease from their own works, as God did from his.

Now thou who art a child of light, understand this one thing for thy comfort
and encouragement in thy warfare against evil thoughts; that notwithstanding
multitude of thoughts do arise in thee, and troops thereof attend thee, which
are in themselves sinful; yet if thou join not with them in thy mind, will, and
understanding, they are not thy thoughts, neither shall the evil thereof be
imputed unto thee, if thou love the light, and keep thy mind joined to the
Spirit of God, or appearance of Christ in thee, that discovers all
temptations unto thee, in the very thought, and first appearance of them; then
thou art helping the Lord against the mighty; being joined unto him, art become
one with him in thy mind, and spirit (though in thy members there is a law, a
power that wars against thee) and as thou abidest with the Lord, waiting upon
him, even as the eye of a Maid waits upon the hand of her Mistress; he will
save and deliver thee and subdue all thy enemies, even those of thy own house,
which are the greatest enemies.

Though temptations may, and will attend thee, yet it is no sin to be tempted,
It is no sin to be tempted.
though with inward temptations; neither art thou to account thy self, nor to
be accounted a sinner, because sin and vain thoughts may present themselves in
thee, in thy warfare estate, yet thou may say as Paul did, It is no more I,
but sin that dwells in me; and that in me, that is in my stesh dwells no good
thing: which flesh thou art now in the way to know withers as the grass, Flesh,
and sin that dwells in it, may be destroved, and the earthen vessel cleansed,
and the creature delivered from bondage, even on this side the grave.
and the glory of it become as the saded flower of the field, and sin that
dwells therein destroyed, and the creature of Gods making preserved, the
earthen vessel that holds the heavenly treasure sanctified and saved, and
delivered from the yoke of bondage the whole Creation of God groans under. And
this thou shall certainly arrive at, as thou keep thy eye upon thy Savior,
thy light, thy way, thy Captain, whom thou will see go before thee conquering,
and to conquer, till all his and thy enemies are subdued, brought under, and
destroyed, and thou made as a King, as a Priest to God, Lest thou should
stumble at those sayings, consider that John was the greatest Prophet that was
born of a woman, yet the least in the Kingdom was greater than he.
meeker than Moses, stronger than Sampson, wiser than Solomon, and more patient
than Job; as thy elder brother was, and as the Primitive Christians were, who
could say, as he is, so are we in this present world, pure as he is pure, holy
as he is holy, righteous as he is righteous, harmless and innocent as he was,
and in all resigned up unto the will of God: not my will (said the second Adam)
but thine, though his will was as innocent and harmless as the first Adams was
before the fall, and did excel: when thou come up hither, thou will
understand and receive what I say, till then it will be as a mystery and hard
saying to thee.

And in thy way take heed of thinking, willing, and running, that obtains not
the prize, stand still and see the salvation of God; mind above all, the arm of
his power in thee, which is able to suppress thy thoughts, mortify thy will,
stop thy running, and give thee perfect strength to resist the Devil, and make
him flee, and to furnish thee to every good word and work, and give thee
dominion over thy own spirit, whose property is to be swift in thoughts, eager
in desire, and restless in the accomplishment thereof.

Now it is written, he that has rule over his own spirit is stronger than he
that rules a City; Consider the simily, and in the light try and compare thy
self therewith, and thou will find the truth thereof.
and he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a City broken down, and
without walls: when the righteous bears rule, the land rejoices; but when the
wicked, the land mourns. These things are infallibly true, while the usurper
keeps the throne, the Prince of Peace and his peaceable government is not
known. Tribulation and anguish comes upon every soul of man that does evil, No
opinion nor profession of Religion, etc. where evil thoughts and evil doings
stands, avails any thing.
that thinks and imagines evil, and that yields his members servants to
unrighteousness, let his opinion, profession, and talk of Religion be what it
will, he that commits sin is of the Devil: and without returning from it, a
finishing or ending of it, and righteousness set up in the room thereof, will
(with the Devil) have the wages and reward of the same, and possess the fruit
of their own thoughts and doings.

Now it is a heavenly estate to live under the government of Christ, to know
and experience him, swaying the Scepter in the heart, and established in the
throne thereof: but this none comes to enjoy, till they have first known him to
sit as a Refiner, with fire; and as a Fuller with soap; and as a Spirit of
judgment and burning; and as the stronger man to dispossess the strong man,
spoil all his goods, sweep and cleanse the house, and to furnish it again with
heavenly goods, with heavenly thoughts, with heavenly desires and meditations,
and all things else that becomes the house of the Lord: Holiness to the Lord
was written or engraven upon the Crown and Plate of Gold, and all the furniture
of the outward Temple was sanctified, of which this is the anti-tipe, or
substance; as he that enjoys it well knows.

And now it is the duty of a Christian to watch in the light against evil
thoughts, and to use the axe of God, which is laid to the root of them, that
their springing again may be hindered, and the end of them prevented; so also
it is the duty of every one, when good thoughts, and desires, springs in the
room thereof to cherish them, to join with them, and to keep their eye unto the
Lord that begat them, or raised them up in the heart: and so they may be called
Gods thoughts, being of his own bringing forth, of his own begetting; being
thoughts of purity, thoughts of peace and righteousness, thoughts of holiness
and joy in the inward man, which thoughts thou of thy self cannot think; Good
thoughts are of Gods own be getting, and very comfortable to a Christian, and
are the fruit and effect of keeping and obeying the Law of God within the
heart, Romans 2.14, 15
these are comfortable thoughts, justifying and excusing thoughts, thoughts
that will stand approved in the light, and the end and tendency of them is
good, even as pleasant fruit to the soul; so that such can say as David once
did, How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O Grd, how great is the sum of
them? if I should count them they are more in number than the sand; when I
awake I am still with thee. As thot love the light, and delightest in the Law
of God, and meditates therein, these good thoughts will multiply, and increase
in thee, to thy great content and satisfaction: But the thoughts of the wicked
are sin, and sin brings trouble, Proverbs 15.26.
anguish and torment; men are accused or excused in their thoughts. It is said
Belshazzer was so much troubled with his thoughts, that his countenance was
changed, and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote together,
Dan. 5.6. Many are the amazing, scaring, tormenting thoughts that attends the
wicked, whose feet run to do evil, and make haste to shed innocent blood; their
thoughts are thoughts of iuiquity, wasting and destruction are in their paths;
the way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment in their goings, etc.
Isa. 59.7, 8.

Now the thoughts of the righteous are right, and those that commit their way
to the Lord, their thoughts shall he established: And that is a blessed state
indeed, to have good thoughts established in the heart, in the mind, The effect
of good thoughts when established in the heart.
such can go forth, and come in, in peace, lie down and rise up in peace, live
and walk in peace, and praise the God of peace, who is blessed for evermore:
And this is the peace, the inward peace, which the world with all its treasures
and pleasures cannot give, nor by its frowns take away, and is the portion of
all that get victory over their own thoughts, imaginations, lusts, defires and
affections; and that do also keep in the wisdom and power of God, that when
good thoughts are established in them, and are so made partakers of the Divine
Nature, that they naturally think good thoughts, thoughts of love, peace, and
obedience, (as they did while in the degeneration think the contrary) yet in
this state of innocence and harmlesness to be diligent in the wisdom of God, to
dress and keep the Garden, Many may eat and drink unworthily, deck themselves
with Gold Jewels, and play the harlot with them, etc.
lest thou having found honey, eat more than may suffice to nourish the right
birth, lest thou feed thy seed thy self without fear, eat and drink and rise up
to play, grow idle and wanton, through plenty, and so forget the Lord, and let
his benefits slip out of thy mind, and slight his Commandments, and let pride
and exaltation in thy selfish spirit grow up again, as the first Adam and
others did, mentioned in the holy Scriptures, which are written for our
learning and admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come, 1 Cor. 10,
11. therefore let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall.

Concerning the Life, State, and Enjoyment of a True Christian.
THE life of a Christian, of an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile, is a
life of innocence, peace, and content; quietness and true satisfaction abounds
in the inward man, he is always doing well, so none can harm him; he always
lives in the fear of God, which taught him to depart from iniquity, He that
lives in the love, fear, and favor of God, needs not fear men nor Devils.
and now preserves him out of the same, he loves God and his Neighbor, and
hates no man, so fears not what man can do unto him; his bread is sure, and his
water fails not, so he takes no thought for to morrow, but receives every day
his daily bread from the Lord; he lives without care, neither does he toil nor
spin; the Lillies life he knows, which Solomon in all his wisdom and glory
wanted, or was not arrayed with: if he has Wife or Children, House or Land, or
the increase of Corn, Wine and Oil, he looks upon them as things below, so does
not set his heart and affection upon them; he looks upon them as they are, and
loves them in their places, but not more than Christ: he loves the Lord above
all, he loves to keep his Conscience void of offense toward God, and toward
man above all; and if he cannot enjoy his Estate and Relations according to the
will of God, he is ready, and willing to part with them, and can say as Job
did, The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away; blessed be the name of the
Lord. He is not afraid of evil tidings, the ruffling of the winds, and the
roaring of the Sea, does not amaze nor affright him, he lives the life of
Faith, which gives him victory, and enables him to overcome all things, The
true Christian stands always armed; though not with carnal weapons.
he keeps on the helmet of it, and the breast plate of righteousness, and the
sword of the Spirit, so is always armed against all assaults of the world,
flesh, and the Devil; and he knows the name of the Lord as a strong tower, as a
shield, as a buckler, as a wall of defense, and is prepared to suffer and
endure all things, like a good Soldier with a settled countenance, and holy
resolution: And though by men he may be accounted smitten and forsaken of God,
and not fit to live upon the earth, yet he enjoys heavenly consolation, pure
tranquillity of mind, refreshment, comfort, and joy in the inward mon; the Kings
Daughter is all glorious within, and all things that do, or can befall a
Christian on this side the Grave, The present enjoyment of the favor and
countenance of God, is more esteemed, more valued by the true Christian, than
all things visible.
are not worthy to be compared to the glory that is and shall be revealed in
him: And if there was no reward on the other side the grave, he would not
exchange his life and condition, for all the glory, riches, and excellency the
world can afford, seeing and accounting it all vanity and vexation of spirit,
yea. less than nothing, and lighter than vanity, Isa. 40.17. Psalm. 62.9. having
found the precious pearl (which the swine regard not) he is willing to part
with all for it, knowing the wonderful virtue, riches, and power thereof, bids
adieu to all the fading treasures, and pleasures of Egypt; choosing rather to
suffer affliction and persecution for righteousness sake, than to enjoy the
Court-pleasures of Princes; and he is a great gainer hereby, even in this life,
on this side the grave, a hundred fold: he finds by experience that saying
true, Codlintss with content is great gain, and is profitable unto all things,
having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, 1 Timothy 4.6.

So though the true Christian seems (in the judgment of the wise in their own
conceit, to lose the enjoyment of his life, honor, riches, profit, pleasure,
preferment, relations, etc. No true enjoyment of any thing, but in the will of
God, and true selfdenial.
instead thereof he finds them all; and in the true self-denial enjoys them
all, and is able to say as Paul did to the Corinthians, speaking of himself and
other Christians, as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many
rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things; having learnt to be content
in all estates and conditions, Content the pleasant companion for a Christian.
knowing how to suffer want, and how to abound, every where, and in all things,
etc. And where there is true content, there is no want, no poverty, no sorrow,
but what is turned into plenty, riches, and rejoicing. In sum, the true
Christian has found the stone of the wise men, (or the universal tincture) or
medicine which cures all inward diseases of the soul, mind, and spirit; The
wonderful riches, virtue, power, and operation of the precious pearl, none
knows but he that has it.
makes him sound and clean every whit, works mighty wonders for him, makes him
more precious than Gold, yea, than fine Gold; makes him rejoice in sorrow, sing
in the stocks, makes a Dangeon a Palace, Bonds and Chains liberty; makes
Poverty Riches, turns loss into gain, darkness into light before him: these and
many more are the virtues and powerful operations of the precious Pearl, the
white Stone, the elect and precious Stone, the chief cornerstone (which the
wise Master Builders set at naught and stumble at, and will not use in their
Building) but to the Christian indeed he is precious, he is his foundation,
corner, and top-stone also; and as a treasure better than mountains of Gold,
and as a Rock out of which issues the water of Life, that makes the River of
Pleasure, that never cease running at the right hand of God: these things are
known and enjoyed by the true Christian, as he arrives at the mark of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus, and all that are but travelers therein, taste
of the same in the way thereto; but the bare professor, or formalist, or
titular Christian knows nothing hereof: for,

The life, riches, and enjoyment of a Christion is inward and hidden; his life
is hid with Christ in God, none knows it but he that has it; his
conversation is with God in Heaven, and his treasure is laid up where he walks
and dwells, and where he sits in heavenly places with his Savior Christ Jesus,
who is made unto him wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption, and
not only so, but he is come to see what is the fellowship of the Mystery, which
from the beginning of the world has been hid in God: he is come to know the
Lord one, and his name one, to the one Body, one Spirit, one Hope, one Faith,
one Baptism, one Way, one Truth, one Life, one God and Father of all, who is
above all, through all, and in all. This is the blessed end of all the
appearances, manifestations, and dispensations, under all the variety of names,
and various workings of the one eternal God toward mankind ever since the
fall, mentioned throughout the Holy Scriptures, and witnessed to by the true
Christian, who really enjoys the end of Paul's bowing his knees, Not to Jesus
the Son of Abraham, David, and Mary, Saint, or Angel, but to God the Father,
all worship, honor, and glory is to be given through Jesus Christ, etc.
or prayer unto the Father of his Lord, his Jesus, and his Christ, of whom the
whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named, Ephesians. 3.

Now when the true Christian has traveled through multiplicity into unity,
through the various dispensations, operations, and workings of the Spirit of
God before the Law, under the Law, through the Law, to the Prophets, and to the
ministration of John, and so to Jesus the Son of Abraham, David, and Mary, and
has The only Pilgrimage of a Christian; all other Pilgrimages to places,
Tombs, and Relics are vain and fruitless.
followed him from the Manger to the Cross, and from thence to the Grave, and
know a being dead and buried with him, and a rising with him; and not only
seeking those things that are above, but has found them, having known and
experienced Christ in all his Offices, as the great Ordinance These things are
not only to be read, professed, and talked of, but experimentally known.
of God, as a Mediator, Reconciler, Intercessor, maker of peace, healer of the
wound, and maker up of the breach the first Adam made, as a quickening Spirit,
and Lord from Heaven; as a King, Priest, and Prophet; as a Savior, Sanctifier,
and Redeemer; as a Purifier and maker an end of sin, and bringer in of
everlasting Righteousness; and as a High Priest to present to God without spot
or wrinkle, or any such thing: when he is thus known to perform all these
offices in and for his people, he is then by such known to sit down at the
right hand of God, having accomplished the work the Father gave him to do,
having put all things under, This is the ascending of Christ up where he was
before he descended, and before there was any cause for his descension: he that
can understand let him.
and restored all things into their primitive order, he then is also known to
surrender up the Kingdom to the Father, and God to become all in all: Thus the
Lord is known one, and his name one.
here the first is known to be last, and the last first; the beginning the end,
and the end the beginning; and the heavenly rest with him who is without
beginning or end: I say rest with him, in a pure celestial stillness, from all
self-working, willing, running, and thinking; and though an innocence, or
innocent self be attained unto, and a harmless will known, yet that must not
act, work, will, run and think of it self, as the true Christian (who has
traveled and experienced, as before is hinted) knows right well; being always
of his elder brothers mind and frame of spirit, saying to his Father, Not my
will, but thine: Herein he receives wisdom to dress and keep the Garden, power
and strength to resist and overcome the Serpent in Paradise, and the Dragon in
Heaven, and to keep his habitation in the heavenly City Jerusalem, which comes
down from God out of Heaven, whose walls are salvation, and whose gates are
praise for ever and evermore.

Concerning the Worship of a Christian, or the Christian Worship) what it
stands in, and how it is performed.
THere is a great contest in Christendom among the diverse Sects and bare
professions of Christianity about Worship; and many are the Modes, Manners,
Forms and Ceremonies that are cried up among them; every Sect conceiving,
imagining and supposing his Way, Manner, and Fashion to be right, etc. all
being full of Dispute, Contention, and quarrelling one with and against
another, envying and hating one another, fighting, killing, and destroying one
another about them, when they are all but of their own devising, forms and
images of their own making; mostly from the example of Jews, Gentiles, and
Apostate Christians; and are not led thereto, nor guided therein by the
unerring Spirit of God; as their fruits make fully manifest to the great
scandal of the Christian Religion.

Now the true Christians Worship is in the Spirit, and in the Truth, not in the
Letter, nor in the Form, barely, but was before all Letters, and outward Laws
and Prescriptions were, before all inventions were, before all errors, and the
spirit of them was: This was the Worship in Paradise; when mankind neglected
this worship he fell into evil, into invention, into error, Sin was the
occasion (or cause) of the Law, the labor of the Prophets, and the coming and
suffering of Christ.
which was the cause of the outward Law, and all other dispensations of God,
for the recovery of lost man: And before he can witness a return out of his
lost estate, he must come again to the same Worship in the Spirit, and in the
Truth (even the Truth in the inward parts) (for that is it which God loves) to
the word in the mouth, to the law in the heart, and the fear in the inward
parts, from all fear toward God, taught by the precepts of men, from all
traditions of men of corrupt minds, from all devices and inventions of men:
This is the blessed estate the true Christian is come into, and is the end,
sum, and substance of all holy Writings, Forms, and holy Traditions,
Ministrations, and Dispensations before the Law, under the Law, and the
Prophets, Wilderness Jerusalem, and Temple-Worship which stood in diverse bodily
exercises, outward works and services, variety of Offerings, observing of
Times, Days, Months, and Years, Meats, Drinks, outward Washings and
Purifications, New Moons, Fasts, Feasts, solemn Meetings, and general
Assemblies once a Year at Jerusalem; all these things were but shadows and
typical; And this is the antitipe and The substance of all shadowy Services
under the Law.
substance shadowed forth by them all. To come to the Worship in the Spirit, in
the Truth, to Mount Sion, the City of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem;
and to come to the general Assembly and Church of the firstborn, written in
Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and the spirits of just men made perfect,
etc. and to know the heavenly City that comes down from God out of Heaven, even
Jerusalem the Mother of all the living Citizens thereof, whose Law and Covenant
is spiritual, and writ in their hearts; whose love, fear, and obedience to God,
is engraven in their inward parts: and from hence arises the true Worship in
the Spirit, and in the Truth.

And this is the Worship the Primitive Christians came to, and were exercised
in, they prayed in the Spirit, not at any set time, or appointed place only,
but at all times, and in all places, according to the Exhortations, pray
always, pray continually, pray without ceasing, I will that men pray every
where, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting, always breathing to the
Lord in Spirit, though never a word be uttered; in the closet, when the door is
shut, the Lord hears, and answers this Prayer: and many times they were,
and are also led forth to pray in words publicly, but mostly for the sake of
others, and in the behalf of others, as Christ Jesus did.

The true Christian is also a preacher of Righteousness, not only in Words,
Sentences, and long Sermons, at set times, and appointed places, but in life
and conversation; A true Christian is always preaching.
in this he is always a Preacher, a Teacher of that which is good, always as a
candle burning, and set in the right place; his lamp trimmed, and his light
shining, always as a City upon a hill, as the salt of the earth, and light of
the world, to season and give light to others, by holy example, which preaches
louder than words.

The true Christians singing or rejoicing is also in the Spirit, and in the
Truth, (and not in iniquity) and with a good understanding; he needs no art not
invention to bring words into Meeter or Rhyme, that they may make a pleasant
sound, and a joyful noise; The Christian Music is not made by Art and Air.
his Music does not stand in outward sounds, made by Art and Air, but his
melody is in his heart, in the spirit, in the inward man, in the hidden man of
the heart, which is the antitipe and substance of all outward music used in
the time of the Law, under the first Covenant, in the Worship and Service of
God; and as far exceeds it, as the substance of a thing does the shadow
thereof: And he that has this heavenly inward rejoicing, and pleasant melody
in the heart, will never invent to himself instruments of Music (like David)
nor delight in the sounds thereof. Where this heart-melody is lost, the outward
invented music is set up, among Jews, Gentiles, and Apostate Christians; for
the true Christian is come to know Christ Jesus, as a Prince of Peace, as a
peaceable Savior, as the Consolation of Israel, and joy of generations; as a
giver of peace, which the world cannot give nor take away, which far surpasses
all the delights of the sons of men, which by nature, art, and invention they
can attain unto.

Now the Spirit of God is universal, and the Truth is universal, and the true
Christian Worship that stands in it, is also (to be) universal; that is, at all
times, and in all places; not only when people meet together in a solemn manner
to wait together upon God, and to he or his word preach, and be preached, and
to hear a Prayer, Psalm, Song, or Hymn, even from his own pure motion and
Spirit, one hour in seven, The true Worship of God stands not in any outward
observation of time, or place, or any bodily exercise therein; but in doing the
will of God, bowing in his Spirit and obeying the voice thereof.
or one day in seven (which is good and profitable in its place) but every
hour, and every day, bowing in spirit, worshipping in the Truth, which makes
free from all error, from all evil, from all vain observations, literal
traditions, and humane inventions about the Worship of God, from all carnal
Ordinances, as Musicks, Meats, Drinks, Washings, Feasts, Fasts, Days, and
Times, which ends, vanishes, or perishes with the using (though holy and
significant in their first institution) these things are not to be touched, nor
tasted, no nor so much as handled by the true Christian; these things are but
beggarly elements, and worldly rudiments which had a beginning, and must have
an end.

And the root or cause of a Christian, which is Christ, is the end of the Law,
and all the types and shadows of it, and fulfils all the righteousness of it,
of the Prophets, and of John also, and is a bringer in of a better hope, a
better Law, a better Covenant, a better Worship; which Hope, Law, Covenant and
Worship is inward, and spiritual, and not outward, and carnal, formal nor
traditional; and all that are come to this worship in the Spirit, and in the
Truth, which is one pure eternal principle of light, life, and power, and have
their hearts tendered by it, and their minds exercised in it, their thoughts and
meditations guided by it, they Let the professors of Christianity try
themselves hereby.
are come to the mystery of the fellowship of the Gospel, to the blessed unity
wherein is no strife, no wrangling, disputing, or contention; no treachery,
wars, cruelty, or violence; because they are all minding one thing, learning of
one teacher, following of one guide, viz. the Grace and Spirit of God: and
though they have diversity of gifts, and are attained to different degrees of
Faith, Different states and growths in the Truth, no cause of dis unity.
of Grace, of Knowledge, Growth and Salvation in the same, and are some as a
foot, some as a hand, eye, ear, and mouth, yet are all as members of one body;
and the meanest has unity with the more noble, the greatest with the least,
the lowest with the highest, the strongest with the weakest; nor is there any
Jar or Schism in this well framed Body, of which Christ, the Unction, the
Anointing is the Head and Teacher, etc.

This heavenly unity is the antitype of the Seamless-Coat of Christ, wove from
top to bottom (which the Soldiers did not rend, tear, or divide, but cast lots
for) and of that Law that forbade weaving linen and woollen together, and
sowing mingled seed.

Now there is no unity, no agreement, no concord betwixt light and darkness,
sin and righteousness, (Christ, and Belial) these things of a different and
contrary nature cannot unite, cannot agree, though they are nigh to each other,
sown in one field. God has sown a good seed in the field of mankind, the
enemy has sown an evil seed, and in many it has taken root, and sprang up
above the good seed, Before there can be true unity in and among mankind, the
seed of the Serpent must be bruised and rooted out of the heart.
even among those professing Christianity it self; and from hence arises and
grows all the evil will, envy, hatred, strife, cruelty, violence, bloodshed,
wars, and murders, in whole Christendom, and till the head of this evil seed
be not only bruised, by the promised seed which God has sowed, but rooted out
also of the heart of man, all these things will grow up; these evil effects can
never cease till the cause be removed, and taken away, as the true Christian
knows right well by experience.

Now the Christians indeed, as they live and abide in this pure external
principle of Light, Life, Spirit, and Truth, they have unity one with another,
and fellowship with God; they are the brethren whose living together in unity
is comely to behold, who have the one mind, one heart, one soul, and have their
minds, hearts, and souls always governed, ruled, and ordered by the good Spirit
of God: as every one lives and keeps this order, ank undor this heavenly
government they cannot choose but live together in unity, in love, in good will,
in peace, heavenly concord, and agreement, every one within himself, with God,
and with each other, and in love to all mankind: here is the end of strife,
wars, and fightings come unto, The end of Wars, etc.
(both within, and without) and this is the time and state wherein instruments
of War and Cruelty, are turned into instruments of necessary use; and as they
abide herein, they can learn war no more, according to the blessed sight and
Prophecy of Isaiah, that Evangelical Prophet. Here Jerusalem is known a quiet
habitotion, the inhabitants thereof being established in peace and
righteousness, far from oppression (the cause of War and Oppression being taken
away, which is evil thicking, evil speaking, and evil doing; and this every one
must know and experience before they can be established in peace, before they
can know the peace of God which passes all understanding, to keep their hearts
and minds, and to rule in their hearts, and to know the aboundings of it, and
to delight therein; as it is The enjoyment of those things men do, and may
witness, are on this side the Grave.
written, the meek shall inherit the earth, and delight themselves in the
abundance of peace; the earth, nor earthly things shall not inherit them; they
tread upon the high places of it, and reign like. Kings and Princes over all
the glory thereof. Oh! Read the 25th. and 35th. Chapter of Isaiah's Prophecy,
and wait in the precious Faith thou have received, till thou enjoy the
fulfilling thereof.
this is a blessed state indeed, wait all to possess and enjoy it more and
more: this is the blessed end of the Gospel of petce, and of the Christian
Religion. My breathing is, that all that profess it, may come to inherit Peace,
Righteousness, and Joy in the inward man; even to lie down in that peace where
none can make afraid, and to dwell on that holy Mountain, where no destroyer
is; and to inhabit that City whose Builder and Maker is God: to whom be praise
and glory for evermore.

A few Words added to the sensible Reader.
THou who art awakened out of the sleep of death, and risen out of the grave of
sin, and sea of corruption, and art come to the exercise of thy spiritual
senses, so that thou can hear, see, taste, and handle the things of God,
thou, well know that the blessed end of all holy men's words and writings,
testimonies and declarations, proceeding from the love of God) is, that others
that are yet unholy, wandering about in and after the vanity of their own
minds, thoughts, and imaginations upon the barren Mountains; even as sheep
without a Shepherd, may come to be gathered and brought home to the fold of
rest, where safety, peace, and satisfaction is to be found for their weary
souls, who have long wandered in desolate places, seeking rest, but finding
none; spending their time, labor, and money for that which does not profit,
feed, and nourish up unto eternal life. I say, to direct these strangers,
wanderers, laborers, and unsatisfied travelers into the way of rest and
peace, is the blessed end of all Words and holy Writings, even that such may
come to possess, enjoy, and inherit the things spoken, and written of; without
which, all hearing, reading, seeking, enquiring, toiling, laboring, spending
time and money is to no purpose.

Now it is the mind, the soul, the spirit of man that wants rest, that is gone
from its center, that has lost it stay, habitation, and dewlling place in God;
and innumerable are the thoughts, imaginations, devices and inventions,
willings and runnings, that poor mankind in this estate is exercised in, and
carried away with both Jew and Gentile, Professor and Profane upon the face of
the whole earth: For in all Sects and sorts of Religions, those who are sincere
and devout therein, propose this end to themselves in the exercise thereof,
viz. to attain a state of happiness and felicity at last: Many are the ways,
means, and precepts, prescriptions, directions, and observations, that men give
and receive from one the other, enjoin and persuade one the other; and
sometimes compel one another by violence, to walk in, and make use of, in order
to arrive thereto, as they think and imagine; but it is in this age: as of old,
the guides and teachers of the people cause them to err, cause them to go
astray, and wander from the right way of the Lord, they were in vision,
judgment, and understanding themselves, and cause all that follow and obey them
to do the same, being unskilful guides, and blind watchmen, are but as the
blind leading the blind, and so both fall into the ditch together.

Now the way to everlasting happiness is but one, both to Jew and Gentile;
which way is Christ, who is the wisdom and Power of God, the Truth, and the
Life; and the appearance of this Christ, of God, is within men, in their
hearts: its first appearance is as a light shining in darkness, and as a pure
spotless Spirit, that consents to no evil, but reproves and convinces all
that are found in it; and to this Light or Spirit, all who write or speak for
God, and the good of mankind, do turn and direct the minds of men, and
endeavor to persuade them to give regard unto its reproofs of instruction, as
being the way to life, and to obey its counsel and teaching, as the only means
of salvation, and way of returning to the rock from whence they were hewn, and
to the hole of the pit from whence they were dug, to their habitation, and
dewlling place in God again; and many thousands in this Island and other
places, can give testimony that this is the only way and means God has
ordained for the recovery, return, and restoration of lost man; and that all
other ways and means which they had been wearying themselves in, availed
nothing; but walking in this heavenly way, the Light, the Spirit, and Grace of
God within, and learning of the anointing within, they come to witness
salvation came to their house, and to surround them as walls and bulwarks, and
to witness the fulfilling of that Divine Prophecy, My people shall dwell in a
peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, Isa. 30.3, 4.32.18.
and in quiet resting-places. The eye of them that see shall not be dim, the
ear of them that hear shall bearken, the heart also of the rash shall
understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerer shall be ready to speak
plainly. These are the blessed effects of walking in the way and paths of
righteousness, which a remnant are living witnesses of, and can praise and
magnify the name of the Lord in the sense thereof.

But none comes to enjoy this blessed estate, nor inhabit this heavenly
dwellingplace, but as their minds comes truly to be exercised by and in the
Light of the Lord, and that by walking and abiding therein, come to have their
minds established, settled, and stayed upon him, who is indeed the alone stay
of his people, and rock of his inheritance.

And nothing can be found in the heavens above, nor in the earth beneath, that
is able to satisfy or stay the mind of man, but the Lord, the mind or soul of
man is more noble, more excellent than all visible things, so they are not all
capable to fill or satisfy his soul, or stay his mind, though he might possess
or have the whole world to himself, yet in the end will be made to cry out and
confess, with the Preacher of old, Vanity of vanity, all is vanity and vexation
of spirit, etc. Eccles. 1. But to have the mind stayed upon the Lord, there is
pleasure, peace, and content, truly found and enjoyed, according to the
testimony of that Divine Prophet Isaiab, who said, speaking in the name of the
Lord, Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is staid upon thee. This
is such a truth, that none knows but he that has it; it may be soon writ,
read, or spoken, but to enjoy that estate is more than words, it is the end,
sum, and substance of all that can be said or done, and is the reward of the
righteous from the immediate hand of God, viz. to be kept in perfect peace:
It Is the end of all holy breathings and desires, its the end of the Preaching
the Gospel of Peace and Sal-Salvation, even to know, and feel, and experience
the peace of God, to keep the heart, and to keep the mind, and to rule there.

This is a blessed state indeed, worthy to be waited for, and pressed after, by
all that have a sight, and sense thereof, and are in the way that leads
thereto though not yet arrived thereat; go forward in the name of the Lord,
even in that name Light, by which he has made himself known unto us in this
age, by which Light thou saw the wandering, and unstableness of thy mind,
and the multitude of thy thoughts, imaginatious, and inventions; persevere in
the same and thou will become not only a child of it, but also grow from a
Child's estate, to the state of a young Man, Elder, and Father; keeping the
Faith, and firmly believing, that which shows thee the wandering and
unstableness of thy mind, will be as a Shepherds Crook unto thee, and in due
time will bring thee back into the fold of rest: and, that that holy Light that
discovers, and shows unto thee thy thoughts, and inward enemies, will also by
the brightness of its arising, disperse and destroy them for thee, and bring
thee into that estate thy soul descrieth, pants, and looks after, even into
the presence of the Lord, where the fullness of Joy is, and where the rivers of
pleasures run; where the reaping and returning with joy is, where the singing
for joy of heart is, and the joy of Gods salvation felt, the blessed Light of
God, or Son of Righteousness, in whom thou have belleved, is the only way to
possess and inherit those things. And thy walking, ablding, and persevering in
it, is the means, and there is not any other way or means appointed of God, to
bring man back into that Paradisical state of felicity he lost by
Transgression, and to the establishing him in it.

But all that walk not, nor ablde and persevere therein, after they are come
into it, never attain to that blessed end of its appearing and shining to them;
for a bare knowledge of the Truth, and a profession of the Light and Spirit of
God within, if they walk not in it, and are not guided and lead by it, it
avails nothing, but rather draws down fierce wrath and vengeance upon the head
of such, who know their Masters will and do it not, who talk and profess well,
but are found doing evil, and thereby lay a stumbling block in the way of the
blind, and cause the way of Truth to be evil spoken of, and the Name of the
Lord (by which he has made himself known in this Age) to be blasphemed, by
reason of their ungedly deeds, under a Profession of Godliness, and Cloak of
Righteousness, such their damnation slumbreth not.

And this I testify and declare to all people to whom this may come (which may
serve also as a caution and warning to them) that if they meet with any under
the Name, Form, and Profession of a Christian (in contempt called a Quaker) who
in his Converse, Trade, and Dealing, Commerce, and Affairs does not let his
Yea, be Yea, and his Nay, Nay, but breaks his word and promises, there is
need to have a special care of that man, and look upon him as one false and
deceitful to the holy Principle of Truth, and as a Hypocrite under the
Profession of it; He that is false to God; cannot be true to men: thou had
better trust and give credit to a Heathen or Infidel, than to such a one. No
wickedness beyond that which is acted under a peculiar Cloak of Religion. Such
who gain Credit and Repute by wearing this Cloak, and get Widows and Orphans
Moneys into their hands, to create great Trades by Sea and Land, and then
break, are some of the worser sort of Robbers and Cheats, and the cry of the
poor Fatherless and Widows cries loud against them. This is a short Testimony
arising in my heart against this sort of Wickedness, wherein I have a little
eased my mind, and in the Truth remain a Friend to all men.

W. S.

THE END.
