A NEW CATECHISM.
Question. WHat think you of the Bible or holy Scriptures?

and true holiness, Genesis 1.26. Col. 3 10. Ephesians. 4.23, 24.

5.12, 14.

1. Thou shall have none other gods but me.

2. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in Heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under
the earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them: for I the Lord
thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show
mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.

3. Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

4. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day. Six days shall thou labor
and do all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God. In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and
thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, thy cattle, and the
stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; Wherefore
the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

which the Lord thy God gives thee,

neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor
any thing that is his.

Q. What are you to believe? Rehearse the sum and articles of your faith?

Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the holy Ghost,
borne of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead
and buried, he descended into hell, the third day he rose again from the dead,
he ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father
Allmighty, from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe
in the holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the
forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
Amen.

Q. What is meant by descended into hell?

A. Not that he went down into hell, but that he remained a while in the state
of the dead, the body in the grave, and the soul in Paradise or Heaven. Or,
that he suffered torments aequivalent to the pains of hell, and such as no mere
mortal man could suffer.
