By Order from Mr Vice Chancellor.
Whereas Thomas Dye and John Fosset, have without License from Me, and in
contempt of the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of this University (to whom
the Ordering and Governing of all Carriers of what kind soever, Trading to or
with the University and City of Oxford, does of Right belong) presumed to set
up a Coach to Travail from hence to London: These are strictly to require all
Scholars, Privileged Persons and Members of this University, not to Travail in
the said Coach set up by Thomas Dye and John Fosset, or either of them; nor to
send Letters or any Goods whatsoever by the aforesaid Coach.

P. MEWS Vice-Chan.
