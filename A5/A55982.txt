The PROCLAMATION For a General FAST in the Nation.
To the Tune of, Packington's Pound.
I.
BY Britains true Monarchs, Great William and Mary,
who have the like Title to Ireland and France,
Proclamation is Issued, whereby to prepare you,
by Fasting and Prayer, their Just Cause to Advance.
By which you may see,
That all Kingdoms be
The Gift of God only, and no Prince's Fee:
And learn, by true Fasting, Devoutly to Pray
Usurpers and Rebels may never get the Day.
II.
About a Year past, not much less, or more,
When first they did Reign, and a little before,
A Wicked Rebellion, in Ireland, has been
Carried on, and maintained, against our King and Queen,
By Irish, too Wild,
But Parent, more Vil'd,
That would keep that Kingdom, even from his own Child
But learn, by true Fasting, Devoutly to Pray,
That God the Occasion would soon take away.
III.
You're told this Rebellion's Contrived and Supported
by Lewis of Bourbon, Usurper of France;
And by him Encouraged, as some have Reported,
by tempting the late King to Abdicate hence;
But what is a Story,
Will shake his Vainglory,
He Banished him thither to Act the mere Tory.
Then learn, by true Fasting, Devoutly to Pray,
Usurpers, etc.
IV.
But would you have thought it, this French King designed
to make little Ireland a Province of France,
Nay, more to Destroy it, its King he Confined
in Person, by Arms, to make its Defense;
And call it his Own,
Though thereby it is known,
What Wrong to King William and Mary is done:
Then in all true Fasting, be sure you do Pray,
Such Impious Usurpers may never get the Day.
V.
The War made for this, and some other Causes
as Honest, but what, you are left for to guess;
One (perhaps) is, because the Old Gentleman Pauses,
and will not go to God, his Children to Bless,
With quiet Enjoyment,
Of their great Employment,
But makes a Complaint, has no Reason or Rhyme in it:
So whilst it continues, in Fasting then Pray,
Usurpers and Rebels, etc.
VI.
This War very Just, besides Necessary,
the King does resolve, with vigor to make;
God assisting the Pious, how can it Miscarry,
at whose Command, both Sea and Land quake;
On which he will Fight,
To recover his Right,
And to due Obedience, Reduce Ireland quite;
That so it may happen, be sure you all Pray,
Usurpers and Rebels, etc.
VII.
To Rescue good Subjects from Force and Oppression,
and give them Prosperity, Safety and Peace,
As well as secure them from future Agression:
King William resolves to quit his own Ease,
And in (Person) so Stout,
Never yet put to Rout,
To lose Soul and Body, or bring it about:
That soon it may be so, Devoutly all Pray,
Usurpers and Rebels, etc.
VIII.
Putting Trust in the Almighty, by whose sole permission,
in a mavelous manner, King William succeeds;
And not to be guilty of any Omission,
may stop the least Blessing to his Righteous Deeds;
The Kingdoms ill Fate,
So to Consumate,
They may once again Settle, be it early or late:
Their Majesty's seriously, bids you to Pray
Devoutly, that Rebels may never get the Day.
IX.
Their Majesty's too, to avoid Innovation,
were Advised by their Wise Privy Council in this,
Swayed by the same Persons so Governed the Nation
in both the last Reigns, that naught went amiss:
And so never fear,
But just as those were,
These Princes will little less Happy appear.
God Pardon all Sinners, Repenting, and Pray
Usurpers and Rebels, etc.
X.
Those Devils of Discord, who tempt to Rebellion,
were all most subject to Fasting and Prayer;
Then no Man can wonder, you must not rely on
one Wednesdays Devotion, when Legions appear:
The Twelfth of March past,
Whilst this War shall last,
The Third Wednesday Monthly, will be a strict Fast;
With Solemn Devotion, wherein you must Pray
Usurpers and Rebels, etc.
XI.
For decent Solemnizing, this no Mock-Devotion,
the Right Reverend Bishops, so Loyal and True,
Must frame Prayers and Collects, with such proper Portions
of Scripture, as fit an Occasion so new:
The Commandments then,
Will be Two less than Ten,
And Old Non-Resistance never mentioned again;
But sent to the Irish, the better to Pray,
Usurpers and Rebels may never get the Day.
FINIS.
