A New BALLAD, With the Definition of the Word TORY.
To the Tune of Hey Boys up go we.
THe Word Tory's of Irish Extraction,
It Is a Legacy they have left here,
They came here in their Brogues,
And have acted like Rogues,
In endeavoring to learn us to Swear.
Those Papists, I may rather say Atheists,
Was sent with a Sham to the Town,
To Swear one Plot up and another Plot down.
With a thick Irish Air, like the same that they Swear,
Contradiction in every Line;
But this I conclude, their understanding's not good,
Their Reason's left in Ireland behind.
Towzer. I will ^^ite on and Sham as I have begun.

Thomson. And I will Lie in Print as you have done.

Church of ENGLAND. There Is nothing essential that divides us two.

PRESBYTER. Let us combine against the common Foe.

SEE how the Tories drives their Trade,
Clokes all with Forty One,
As all the Rogueries of that Age
By Presbyter was done:
But if you will trace them to the place
Where first they did agree,
You Will find the Plot was laid at Rome
To destroy the Monarchey.
The Jubilies that was held there
For th'destruction of this Land.
A Thousand Masses was prepared
To keep up the holy Band;
A League or Covenant you may called.
Judge which will best agree,
Was hatched at Rome, transported here,
To destroy our Monarchey.
The Second Part to the same Tune.
At Richelius Closet had second Birth,
And privately sent hither
To breed dissension in Church and State,
We one might hate another.
It may trouble every Protestant
That these things e're should be,
Their shaming Plots would cut out Throats
To destroy the Monarchey.
And yet they are the Sham-pretenders
That balls out the Old Cause,
And swears they are the great defenders
And supporters of our Laws:
They Will defend the King by swearing round
God Dam them it shall be,
And add the Cross to the Tripple-Crown
To support the Monarchey.
They Are not ashamed of Eighty-Eight,
Or the Gunpowder Plot;
The Irish-Mssacre is dead,
And quite with them forgot;
They have forgot those Stratagems
Did not with us agree,
They used the means, but lost the ends
To destroy the Monarchey.
And now they act it over again,
Their sham designs, to bring
These Kingdoms in a Civil War,
Swear they will preserve the King.
Thinks all their former faults forgot;
But he that reads may see,
They Plot to Live, and Live by Plot
To destroy our Monarchey.
This Holy and Religious Church
Directs them in this way,
To swear they will defend the the King
By making us there prey.
The Church of England it must down
As well as Presbytree,
Because it does defend the Crown
Of our great Monarchey.
L'Estrange, their English Bellarmine
Writ on in their defense,
And scandalous Thompson Prints the same,
Who never yet knew sense.
St. Omers Hedg-burds go to work,
And make it there Decree,
To preserve the King by pulling down
The English Monarchey.
By Dispensation from the Pope
We will set up another,
A King that never shall revoke
The Holy Church his Mother;
We Will extinguish all that Scottish Race
Which favors Heresy,
Set up a Roman in his place,
In our great Monarchey.
The Penal Statutes they shall down,
Which long has bore the sway,
High Mass be sung in every Church,
Prosessions every way;
We Will Reform the Church by dint of Sword
Since the Keys they will not do,
We Will make the Whigs dance a new Jigg,
And to the Altar bow.
But Heavens preserve our great Monarch,
With the Partner of his Bed,
May Britains Diadem lastingly
Sit fast on Charles his Head:
While that the Sun and Moon endures,
In this let us agree,
To Defend the King and preserve the Laws
Of this great Monarchey.
FINIS.
