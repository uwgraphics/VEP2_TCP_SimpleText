A Treatise concerning Estates Tail, and discents of Inheritance.
YOu demand (good Sir) if Estates tail may be cut off? whereto I may shortly
answer, that every Act for the lawful execution thereof requires power and
will, without both which only things casual are accomplished; the will naming
the work good or bad, the power giving hability to finish what the will freely
intends. This power may truly be called possibility, enabled either by
Nature, or by Law; for that which is unnatural or against our natures, is not
judged possible or in our powers; no more is that which is to be done against
the Laws: for we have no due power to do ought that is unlawful, all our
powers being subject unto Law; for illud possumus quod jure possumus: Now
touching the power and authority, to avoid estates tail, it is plain that as
the making of them was authorized by the Stat. of West. 2. so by the Stat. of
4. H. 7. cap. 24, and 32. H. 8. cap. 36. Tenent in tail may lawfully cut them
off: since therefore the power to create an estate tail, and the power to
bar the Issue in tail are equally warranted by Law; for apari potestate par
causatur effectus, the next doubt will be if our wills or affections to cut
them off do sort to a lawful end; which end though it be last in execution,
yet ought it to be first Censured; as the first part of all our actions: and
touching this point, I must refer my self to every man his peculiar
conscience, who can best make answer in this behalf what he intends: only
I must note by the way, that such as avoid and cut off these estates to none
other purpose but to enlarge their wanton expenses, and to give them more scope
to live licentiously, as they unjustly spoil their Heirs of their due
Inheritances, so shall not this my defense extend unto them; since my purpose
only is to reduce estates tail to the most proper conveyance of the Common
Law. And because sometime the effects produced of our actions are taken for
their ends, whereby they are to be valued; And since the frustrating of estates
tail disposes it self to none other end then to set at liberty these
fettered Inheritances: To prove therefore whether Inheritance at Common Law, or
these Statutes, or conditional gifts are to be preferred; it behooves me to
show you what an Inheritance is, and what an estate tail is, that so you may
more easily conceive their differences. In the Civil Law Inheritance is
Successio in universum jus quod defunctus habebat, which definition does well
agree with our Common Law, which says, that an Inheritance is such an estate
as may be inherited by the Heir, which estate does naturally descend to the
Heir; as if it were joined and included in him by a violent motion of the Law:
and this descent is that which the Civilians call succession, and our Common
Lawyers Inheritance: which so cleaves to the Heir, as if the Father
disseiseth a stranger, and dies seized; this Land shall descend to the Heir
against his will, and he is Tenant to the precipe though he never enters. And
in like manner shall Lands purchased descend, except the Purchasor does some
Act to the contrary; and except in cases of Attainder: by this I gather that
Inheritance is the Act of the Law; for Nemo est haeres viventis, no man is
Heir of him that is living, and dead men have no power to choose their Heirs:
therefore I say it must follow that this descent is the act of the Law, and
dis-inheriting, or altering the course of Inheritances, the act of the party.
The consultation now must be, if the Act of the person may justly make void the
Act of the Law; wherein we must consider the force of the Laws, and the
hability of persons: first therefore Law as St. Thomas says, is Quaedam
rationis ordinatio ad bonum commune, a certain disposition of reason to common
good; which disposition is (by Frigius) called a Coercion of things voluntary,
and not voluntary; whereby it seems that if we will be reasonable creatures,
we must submit our selves to the governance of the Law, which as it is said, is
the disposition of reason, and the Coercion of our wills offending reason: the
Law therefore as a mute Magistrate compels us to her obedience, warranteth
us safety under her Target; and though Laws were made for men, yet were they
not made to rule men, by which I gather, that Laws are superior to men, and
men inferior to Laws; the Acts therefore of the Laws are paramount, or above
the Acts of the party; and to draw this my present purpose, since the descent
of Inheritance in Fee-simple is wrought only by the Law; and since these gifts
entaile are the natural issues of men's fantasies, why might I not here
conclude that our estimation of estates tail ought to be much inferior to
that estate which the Common Law creates? howbeit since this has bin spoken
generally, and confusedly of all Laws, and since we are in this government
subject to diverse sorts of Laws in diverse respects, it behooveth me to show
you what Laws do principally concern this matter, and how Inheritances are
respected in either of them; and since Fee-simples, and estates tail are
opposite in their natures, and since likewise the Adage says, Ferro aperire
viam qui per contraria transit, I will prove unto you that the proper and
natural descent of Fee-simple is good, and lawful in all Laws, by which
means it will follow, that estates tail being contrary to Fee-simple are not
good, nor lawful, for contraries agree not: Laws therefore are either Divine
or humane, and divine Laws are either Laws of nature, or Laws deluded. But
before I speak of humane Laws, I shall first show you that the form of
Inheritance which the Common Law supporteth, agrees with the Laws of nature;
and so by consequence with the Laws of God: for proof whereof it were enough,
considering the perspicuity of the Matter, if I should use the authority of
Plowden, who says that nothing in our Common Law is ordained against nature,
and yet our Common Law will that Inheritances shall descend to the Heir: but
to prove it more particularly, the first Act that nature requires is to
procreate, the second to preserve, the third to provide for sustenance, which
provision comprehends the whole effect of Inheritances: and in the Civil law
it is called haereditas legitima, which is said to appertain most properly to
the Father his office, as haereditas naturalis which consists in nourishing and
education, belongs to the Mother, and though natures laws which are only
written in our hearts, have not expressed in any literal manner that this
provision or Inheritance, belongs more to the Heir then to the rest of our
Children, or Kindred, yet has the continual practice of all ages testified
unto us, that the laws of nature would we should leave our Inheritances,
first rather natis then agnatis, rather to our Children then to our Cousins,
and rather to Sons then to Daughters; and if we have Sons, we have
likewise a Rule that says, Proximus excludit remotiorem, and in all
governments the eldest Sons are admitted either to all, or most part of the
Inheritance, and in want of Sons, Daughters, for whom nature injoynes us
rather to provide then for more remote Cousins: and these general received
Customs of all; times and places are the best means we have to interpret the
laws of nature, which are only delivered to us in examples of times past. The
second part of God his Laws are the laws written, wherein the omnipotent
Maker of the world has discovered unto us in his express Words, what his high
pleasure is we should do concerning Inheritances: and though I be not so
skillful in these laws as I ought to be, yet I have noted out of the Prophet,
that he would not so much as suffer the first begotten son, even of the hated
Wife to be dis-inherited; neither ought any man to take example of some Holy
men, who have crossed this course of Inheritance, considering that it has
always happened either by the express Commandment of Almighty God, and so was
Adonai dis-inherited by King David his father, and the Inheritance bestowed on
Solomon a younger brother; or else it chanced for some notable crime by the
Heir, and so was Reuben the Heir of Jacob dis-inherited, and his Inheritance
given to the Sons of Joseph: and this I have repeated to none other purpose
then to prove, first that Inheritances are agreeable to the laws of nature;
and lastly that they are commanded by the express laws of God, and therefore
ought not but upon special cause be violated: since I have showed you what I
have gathered out of Divine laws concerning Inheritances, it follows that I
speak somewhat of humane laws, and namely of our common laws, for by them
are Inheritances only managed in this government; except in some peculiar
places, where Custom, often the daughter of error, has indenized and made
free degenerating forms of Inheritances, as of Gavel kind, and Burgh English,
which custom I must here omit, as more fit for another place; to show you what
our common law is, and what kind of Inheritance it produces, that so by
enquiring what entailes are not, I may discover what they are: our Common law
implies his definition in his name, for it is called Commune jus, quasi
Communis justitia; common Justice, and it is divided into two parts, old and
new; the ancient are such as whereof we neither know beginning nor ending, and
in these laws entailes were utterly unknown, and our Inheritances were
disposed in the act of the law, only by descent in Fee-simple, which as Mr.
Littleton says, is haereditas legitima vel pura, and this Fee-simple was
settled on the Heir and his heirs by a perpetual operation of the law.
Another sort of Fee-simples conditional there was likewise I confess, but
this condition was no adition of the law, but only a restraint of the donor,
which restraint was used by our forefathers instead of estates tail, tying
thereby the Inheritance to the issue of the body of the Donee, but saving to
the donor no Reversion, or at most but a Title, or possibility of a Reversion
for want of Heirs of the body of the Donee, for Fee-simple admits no
Reversion, yet could not the Donee alien his estate before he had issue, and by
having issue settled the Inheritance in him; then was this Title, or right to
this Reversion of no longer estimation in our law: and this appears by the
Statute that says post prolem habuit potestatem alienandi, which liberty of
the alienation (after he had issue) in mine opinion was just and reasonable;
and herein shall my opinion be easily ratified, if it shall be considered what
mischiefs might otherwise happen to the tenent conditional, if he should
still be detained from power to alien after he had issue, for so might he be
compelled to admit one, peradventure none of his, or an unworthy heir of vile
condition, which no extremity of law requires: our Common Law therefore
nothing mistrusting the fathers care to preserve his Inheritance for his heir,
gave to the father after he had issue power to alien at his pleasure, that so
he might retain this power as a bridle to restrain the unrulinesse of Youth,
who in his education would peradventure do better for hope of reward then for
fear of punishment; or at least do best being compelled by them both, and
hereof I would only gather that Common law is common Justice; and that the
ordinary sort of Inheritances commanded by the Law of God, and that though
Fee-simple conditional somewhat swerveth from the purity of Fee-simple, yet
that the restraint of the Donee his alienation for the benefit of the donor was
just until the Donee had issue; and that likewise the Donee his liberty to
alien after (by having issue) he had settled the Inheritance in himself was
likewise most just, and herein only did Fee-simple conditionally differ from
gifts in tail, which by the Stat. of West. 2. restrained the Donee either by
Deed, or feoffment from prejudicing his issue.

2 Section of Stat. Laws.
ANd now I shall for a while cease to speak of our ancient Laws, to remember
somewhat of our newer sorts of laws commonly called Statutes, which I have
termed the newer sort, because we are assured of the times of their
beginnings, and of these new laws the whole virtue consists, either in
commanding things necessary, forbidding things hurtful, punishing things
unjust, or permitting or making lawful things otherwise unlawful; concerning
any of which when we call in doubt our necessity of obedience to them, we must
consider that such as justly command, or justly forbid, are of more respect
then those which only punish, since the price of the offense against Statutes
punishing consists in the measure of the punishments; but such Statutes as
only permits or gives liberty to do things unlawful, because they are but
authorities to break the laws; therefore they are unworthily termed laws,
and by consequence not so to be respected: with this does St. Thomas well
agree, saying, permissio non est officium legis quia lex adfert necessitatem,
sufferance or permission is not the office of the law, because the law
imports a necessity, whereby I conceive that such statutes as neither
command, forbid, nor punish, are left in our discretions to be kept or broken,
except the keeping of them impugn the laws Divine: it should seem therefore
that since the making of estates tail was but a permission, and no
commandment, (for no man is compelled to make them) that it remains as a
thing indifferent to be done or undone for ought that appears in our Common
Laws; and touching the cutting them off when they are made, I must say as I
have said before, that as they were authorized by Statute, so has later
Statutes authorized the cutting them off, the making therefore of them (as now
it stands) is but an act voideable, and therefore being made scarcely by good
advice they merit only a void reputation: yea and when they were in their best
force before 4. H. 7. or 32. H. 8. though the tenent in tail was so girt to
his estate as a Fine levied by him was not able to bar his issue, yet our
common law scarcely brooking this unnatural brood, carved out of men's
imaginations, made diverse incursions and breaches upon this knotty kind of
Inheritance; sometime by dis-continuance, sometime by warranty lineall with
assets, and sometime by collateral warranties, yea and when the statute of 4.
H. 7. was after made and scarcely thought sufficient: in 19. H. 8. to bar the
issue in tail by fine, the Sages of the Law perceiving that while they
defended a Reversion in the Donor which in common presumption should never
happen, they suffered so many mischiefs to creep into the body of the law,
and so many discommodities to tenent in tail, as they were enforced in the 32.
of H. 8. to put that ambiguity out of doors, and by Fine to give tenent in
tail absolute power to bar his issue; and this I have only showed you to
none other end then to acquaint you with the inception and progress of these
entailes, out of which I would note that they continued not long in any firm
sort, and that a short experience had manifested so many encumbrances
proceeding from them: as our forefathers sought all convenient means to avoid
them; who therefore would adventure after so many sharp experiences to intaile
his land, because intailes are neither warranted by God his Law, nor by the
ancient common laws of this Realm. Again, since intailes are only suffered
to be made in such manner as we cannot assure our selves that this permission
will prove a general pardon for the offense committed, or a remedy for the
mischief that happily will ensue; and considering that by intayling we
disturb the common form of the most rightful and approved kinds of
Inheritances, commanded by Almighty God, who cannot retractare suum decretum,
and defended by our common law under which we live, and must of necessity
therefore be good. I may well gather that these new fashioned gifts (being
contrary and opposite to all purposes) are undoubtedly to be suspected vicious
or very dangerous; what conscience therefore should any man make in undoing
that which is all begun, or in avoiding that which is made voydable of purpose
to be avoided as unprofitable? And yet I grant that some temporal laws are
in conscience to be kept according to the rule in Saint Thomas who says, lex
que ad bonum commune referatur and potestatem non excedat ejus qui ipsam condit
et secundum formam justitiae distributive servata ratione proportionis imponat
subditis onera and denique utilis sit habeatque reliquas conditiones, such
laws in conscience ought to be kept, but if we examine this our law of West.
2. we shall find it as I have said, no law, but a permission to break the
law; we shall find that long and often proof has taught us that it agrees
not with public good, we shall find likewise that since we are assured that
this descent in Fee simple best pleases our Lord, we have some cause to doubt
whether it lies in man his power without special cause to permit by a new law
the violation of so holy a law, and to be short, it fails in all points that
might press our consciences: but on the other side for the preservation of
Inheritances we shall find good matter to touch our consciences, for quod
naturalis lex et divina atque adeo etiam aeterna dictat esse faciendum, hoc
necessario est in conscientia faciendum. Since therefore as I have showed you,
natures law, and the example of all Divine laws do warrant our common law, in
the course of Inheritances, we ought fearfully to attempt the altering of
them, and without fear reduce them to proper and natural course: But before I
write any more of the avoiding of estates tail, since the manner of doing by
recovery is displeasing to some persons, I think it not amiss to show you
mine opinion thereof: first therefore I confess that Recoveries are likewise
instruments used to cut off estates-taile remainders and reversions, and the
cause why the tenent in tail is barred, is in respect of the assets only
which is or may be recovered in value; and though you may say that this
recovery is but a fiction of the law, yet lex fingit ubi subsistit equitas, and
though this value to be recovered is posted over to the common Crier, who in
ordinary presumption shall never be able to answer all values recovered
against him; yet if the father whom the law presumes to be careful enough of
continuing his Inheritance, shall be content to seek recompense where none is
to be had, how does the law offend in supposing this to be done for the best?
and if it were done for the best, what injury should the Heir sustain, or the
law offer? besides the recovery being but a feoffment of Record in his own
nature changes no use, except some new use be declared; neither should I be
curious how these intailes were cut off (so as it were in form of law) since
me thinks, it skills not whether an unthrifty twigge be cut off with a sword,
or with a hook, for Major est diversitas respectu materie quam form, and it
is more reasonable or natural to accept a recompense of him that has nothing,
because he may have enough, then to provide for a possibility of escheat,
whereto the aspect of our law has never reached, because it is unnatural.

Thus you have partly heard what Divine and humane laws esteem of
Inheritances, and have entailes preposterously altering the form of
Inheritances are valued.

And lastly that the cutting off by Recoveries is lawful enough, so as it be
to a lawful end, and that to restore the common law to her proper and most
ancient course is an Act well deserving; but this has bin gathered only out of
the laws: and the next that follow in order are the persons, who of necessity
must be either Donors, Donees or their heirs: the Donors are either parents,
or strangers: by parents, I mean principally the father who is called so of
pantater, quasi omnia servans, which etymology does well express the office of
a father to consist principally in providing and keeping for his Children, in
respect of whom he is only a father; and this natural care and fatherly
provision our common law seems to favor: for whereas feoffments made amongst
strangers, if they be not clothed with good and valuable consideration, the
use of the gift is not changed, but the donee remains seized to the use of
the donor for want of reciprocal exchange of gain; yet if the father
infeoffeth his child, the consideration of fatherly affection is prized
recompense enough to change the use, and this holds true of all consanguinity:
but the heir which is so called ab haerendo, quia haereditas sibi haeret, has
in law a more mutual valuation with his father, and a greater interest in the
Inheritance then the younger sort; for if the heir endoweth his wife by the
consent of his father, this endowment is good; and if the son dies, the wife
shall have her dower though the father lives, but this holds not of the
younger sons, by which it appears that our law admits the heir an interest
in his Inheritance during his fathers life; but if this should seem strange,
then may it be more plainly proved out of Mr. Glauvile, who putting some
difference between quaestum, and haereditas, says that the Common law would
not suffer the father to give any part of his Inheritance to his younger sons
without the consent of his heir, his words to that purpose are these, si quis
plures habuerit filios mulieratos, non poterit de facili praeter consensum
haeredis sui filio suo post-nato de haereditate sua quantamlibet partem donare.
If any man shall have diverse sons lawfully begotten, he may not easily without
his heirs consent give any part of his Inheritance to his younger son and yet
after he grants that the father may give part to a stranger, or to his
bastard, which might seem hard, if he had not showed the reason thereof, viz.
quia si hoc esset permissum, accideret inde frequens prius natorum filiorum
exhaereditatio propter maiorem patrum affectionem quam saepe erga post-natos
suos habere solent.

Thus may you see how much our law esteems and defends the birthright of
the heir, not only in giving him private power by the consent of his father
to endow his wife, but likewise in restraining the father from following his
peculiar affection in bestowing his Inheritance contrary to the meaning of the
law, and this for ought I know remains law to this day; neither is it
unreasonable that the heir whom the law only burdeneth with descents of
warranties debts, and such like, should by the law reap only the advantage of
Inheritances.

Much more equally therefore has our common law provided for our heirs, then
these abortive estates tail; and yet of entailes I confess, that some are
more tolerable then others, because they do less manacle the pure and
natural course of Inheritances: for when lands are given to the eldest son,
and to the heirs of his body, this varieth not much in the order of descent
from fee-simple, because the immediate heir male or female shall by this gift
enjoy the Inheritance otherwise due, and were it not for defrauding Creditors,
and abasing the price when a sale is enforced, and some other inconveniences, I
should think it just; but if lands be given to a man and to his wife, and the
heirs of their two bodies, if the wife dying leave but a daughter, though
afterward the Husband marrying again has issue a son and dies, by this
gift entaile the daughter shall dis-inherite the son against the express
rule of all laws. Again if lands be given to the heir apparent, and to the
heirs males of his body, with remainder over to the heirs male, by this gift
the heirs generally are against all right robbed of the birthright: which
fashion of restraining of Inheritances from their due form does seem to me
most unjust; and this I affirm the rather because we find no such gift
expressed in the statute of West 2. though I confess they are taken to be
comprehended within the meaning thereof; but because this word heirs in his
equivocate sense has diverse ways to be understood, it were meet I should
discover my meaning thereby, which principally intends the first begotten
son, who only can be heir according to master Glanvils primogenitus patri
succedit in totum, ita quod nullus suorum fratrum partem inde jure petere
potest, the first begotten son succeeds the father in all, so as none of
his brethren can lawfully claim any part thereof, in whose absence the second
brother succeeds, and so in order; and in want of brothers the sisters are
heirs: for Mr. Glanvile likewise says, that si non reperiantur fratres,
vocandae sunt sorores quibus praemortuis eorum liberi vocantur. And this has
not only bin a continual practice of the common law, but it is likewise well
warranted by the Commandment of Almighty God, as may appear by his Answer 23.
Numbers, when Moses delivered unto him the petition of the daughters of
Salphaad, when after their fathers death without sons they demanded
possession of his Inheritance amongst their Cousens, which was, Iustam rem
postulant filiae Salphaad; da jis possessioneminter cognatos patris sui, et ei
in haereditatem succedant; ad filios autem Israel loqueris haec: homo cum
mortuus fuerit absque filio, ad filiam transibit haereditas; si filiam non
habuerit, habebit successores fratres suos. The daughters of Salphaad do ask
that which is just, give them possession among their fathers kindred, and let
them succeed him in the Inheritance; and to the children of Israel these things
shall thou speak; when a man shall dye without a son, the Inheritance shall
pass to his daughter: if he has never a daughter, his brethren shall
succeed: and this has not bin only commanded, but practiced in all ages, for
women have succeeded in Kingdoms, and in the greatest Inheritances.

If I have failed in the beginning of this discourse to prove that Inheritances
at our common law do follow to all purposes their true pattern set forth in
the laws Divine, let this I pray, serve for a full supply therein, since
hereby you may perceive they agree to all intents, and least we should take
this as a law limited to continue some short time, it follows, eritque hoc
filiis Israel sanctum lege perpetuum: worthily therefore was lex Voconia in the
civil law, which excluded women from their Inheriting, abrogated as unworthy
of the reputation of a law, since it swarveth from the form of God his law;
and to this purpose has St. Augustine lib 3. De Civitate dei, lata est Romae
lexilla Vocoium, ne quis haeredem foeim eam faceret, necunicam filiam: qua lege
quid iniquius dici aut cogitari possit ignoro. The Voconian law is made at
Rome, by which it is prohibited that daughters or a daughter shall inherit,
then which law I know not what can be said or devised more wicked; who is he
that understanding the high pleasure of Almighty God concerning the bestowing
of his Inheritance, but would fearfully alter a law so everlastingly hallowed?
and what son perceiving that his father through ignorance had offended this
law, and knowing that he has power to amend this fault, but he will without
fear and with all speed endeavor to settle his Inheritance in such course as
he undoubtedly knows shall best please Almighty God?

But least I dwell too long on this point, I must speak somewhat of the
instrument or means whereby entailes are made, which sometimes impair,
sometimes amend that which is made.

Entailes therefore are either accomplished by feoffment, by deed, or by
testament.

Feoffment is a gift or grant performed by delivery of seizin.

A deed is an instrument likewise constutitive, conveying some estate by
inrolement.

A testament is the just sentence of the mind. All which do agree in one point.
viz. that our wills and consents are the causes without the which not any of
them can be perfected; for as the testament is only the will of the testator,
so is neither a feoffment nor deed worth ought, but by the consent and will of
the feoffer or donor. And as they agree in this (which is all the substance of
a testament) so do they differ in the solemnity or manner of accomplishing.

For our law preventing rashness in passing so large an estate as a Lease for
life, or an estate of Inheritance, have to feoffments and deeds knit a
necessity of Livery, and inrollment to remain as pregnant witnesses that the
feoffment or deed was made by good advice, but to wills though they be of no
force during the life of the Testator, no other solemnity is required but the
death of him that made them, which prevents all possibility to amend ought that
is amiss.

Another difference you may likewise note, (which I have, though to another
purpose) touched before, viz. deeds and feoffments require recompense to make
the use change, but wills do pass the estate they contain, and the use
without regard of recompense; these imperfections and differences were the
cause why wills were not entertained in our common law, or at most but in some
customary places, as in Burgh English where because the Inheritances by those
customs descended to the youngest son; the common law therefore in favor as
I guess of the heir, permitted there the use of wills as a means to reduce
the customary lands to th'heire at common law, and this I guess so, because in
the common law they were utterly disabled to convey Inheritances before the
statute of 32. H. 8. cap. 1. except as I have said, where custom had usurped
on the common law.

And well was it considered in my judgment, that Acts done at so unfit times as
wills are usually made, should not dispose of matters of so great weight as
Inheritances, for our forefathers thought it not lawful in extremes of
sickness, by feoffments to pass their Inheritances, in extremis tamen agenti
non est hoc cuiquam hactenus permissum, quia possit tuncimmodica fieri
hereditatis distributio, si fuisset hoc permissum illiqui fervore passionis
instantes et memoriam et rationem amittit. But to a man in extremity of sickness
this is not permitted, because then an immoderate distribution of the
Inheritance might be made, if this were lawful to him who loses his memory,
and reason by the fervor of his present passion. This was the common law in
Mr. Glanvile his time, and yet remains for ought I have read, whose authority
I do often remember as most worthy, being one of the most ancient Judges of
our law, who as he has delivered this of feoffments, so of wills he says,
possit tamen huju smodi donatio in ultima voluntate alicui facta ita tenere, si
cum consensu heredis, and ex suo consensu confirmaretur, yet says he, such a
gift made by will to any man may hold, so as it be made by the consent of the
heir, and confirmed by his consent; most just therefore in my judgment is our
common law herein, which suffers not the father in extremity of sickness to
dispose of his Inheritance, since few men pinched with the messengers of death
can afford reason his proper use.

Since therefore wills are for the most part made rather out of fervor of
passion then by advised deliberation of the mind, and since some are made by
compulsion, other by ignorance, and some to content the importunity of others,
when yet they hope to live longer then they happen, in all which cases they are
esteemed as no wills, for voluntas est que neque per vim neque per ignorantiam
fit, since I say all these inconveniences are likely to happen, and may
scarcely be avoided in wills; as few estates tail are much to be regarded, so
none less then such as are composed by will: unworthy therefore shall I
esteem this instrument to have power concerning Inheritances, though it be
permitted by a late statute.

But since the Civil Law is the true mother and maintainer of wills, it were
not amiss to show you that therein the power of wills is not absolute in
disposing of Inheritances, which any man that doubts may see in the Title of
Querela inofficiosi, which is said to be subsidiarium remedium a quo petitur a
iudice ut testamentum contra pietatis officium ex suo officio rescindat, et
datur liberis et parentibus, fratribus vero et sororibus si turpes personae
scriptae sunt.

Thus you may see that even the Civil law has compassion on Inheritances, and
gives the Children power as it were to Cancel their fathers wills if they be
against the office of piety, and what almost can be more impiety? on the
fathers part then to dis-inherit his first begotten Son, his issue, for none
other cause then for that Almighty God who only makes heirs, made his sons
heir, a daughter or daughters, and rather to substitute another who can be no
more his heir then puer supposititius, that is, a Changling can be Child to
her that never bare him, for nemo est here is viventis: how therefore should one
that lives make an heir, since there can be no heir till the father be dead.

This act therefore as it is unnatural, so is it impious, for all sins are
most grievous that are most unnatural; but because it may here be alleged
that wills import a charge or Commandment of the division necessary to be
observed, it behooveth me to prevent that objection.

Which answer first therefore me thinks it were absurd to say generally, that
all wills contain a necessity to be performed, since some wills are
impossible, other unlawful, and many doubtful to all; which if we should tie
a necessity of fulfilling, we should force things unpossible, things unlawful,
and things doubtful, which were very unmeet: but if some bind us, and some
leave us at liberty, then must the difference proceed either of the persons, or
of the things devised, or some other circumstances: touching the persons, I
make no doubt but some will call in question the duty of the Child, that
receives the benefit of the gift, to the father who bestows the gift, as a
forceable argument against me, to which duty I could give great power and
respect, if it were only spoken by the younger sons: for since they cannot
claim any right in the Lands devised, but by the will, it were somewhat
reasonable that the father having for them injured his Inheritance, should
restrain them from doing more wrong, by plucking the Reversion out of the
heir.

On the other side, if the father devises his Lands to his heir, because if
this devise had not been made, the Inheritance should notwithstanding have
descended to the heir, as it were hard to clog his free right by improper
condition, so it were reasonable for him to use any lawful means to cut off
his unjust fetters; for the common law says, that if the father devises Lands
to his son and heir in Fee-simple, the heir may waive or forsake the
devise, and hold himself in by descent, as if no will had been ever made:
otherwise it is, if the devise be to a younger brother, or to a stranger, who
are only tied to the power of the will, if they will enjoy their estates
created by the will: this has been said to prove unto you, that the fathers
will is not of force absolute to bind the heir where the Law investeth a
former right in him, by which I could infer that the fathers commandment
being but an expressing of his will, cannot be of any better force then his
will. As lawful therefore would I think it for the son and heir to cut off
an intaile devised by his father, notwithstanding his employed commandment to
the contrary, as it is for him to seek remedy for a dangerous wound given to
him by his father in his displeasure, though he should charge him to the
contrary. But if this be not enough concerning imperium, or mandatum Patris,
we have a rule that says, verba imperativa ad privatum favorem prolata
necessitatem non inferunt, sed consilium. If therefore some private favor has
bred this Commandment, as it appears most evidently that it has, then does
it not infer necessity, but Counsel, which Counsel may either be followed
or neglected, according to the convenience of the cause. But since this
counsel as I have showed you, tends to the crossing both of Gods Laws, and
the worlds, I would think that the heir should very weakly be compelled to
obey it, especially if we remember that Mandatum est temporarium, hoc est,
mandantis morte expirare, which seems reasonable, considering that a
commandment being a thing merely personal, as given in the person of a
father, must of necessity take his ending with the person, for quod personae
coheret, morte extinguitur. And this holds against the greatest persons in the
world, for mortuus est rebus humanis exemptus, and therefore not allowed to
moderate amongst the living. If this therefore holds amongst Princes, much
more does it hold among private persons, between whom it has no general
force while they are living, for though the wife owes obedience to her
Husband, yet if he commands her to release her Dower, she is not bound to obey
him. So likewise if the father commands his heir to give his Inheritance from
his Children, neither was this commandment lawful in the father to give, nor
in the son to obey, because it is unnatural in them both.

But to weigh this matter more strictly, it shall not be amiss to look into
the policies inducing us to make estates tails, and policies persuading the
contrary, which policies are best judged by their intentions, the principal
inspection whereof adds or detracteth from either of them.

In Baintons case I have noted only one reason urged in the behalf of these
entailes especial: viz. 1. the Fame of the giver this is divided into two
branches, Fame in continuing in his Name with advancement, and Fame in being
founder of a house. And first concerning the manner, it is a thing wherein we
have no property, for sometimes Dogs and Horses are called by our greatest
Sir-names, and so are other men, and perhaps such as are our enemies. And
touching the founding of a House, though I confess it a thing worthy of
memory, yet were this foundation much better hestowed on some of our nearest
blood, and on such as the law persuades us so to do, and so may we assure our
selves, that this house, or houses thus founded are our own, being built upon
our own ground, I mean such Children as are proceeding from our own Loins,
by benefiting of whom we benefit our selves, they being part of our selves,
and this course is most just and freest from offenses; for if we leave our
Inheritances to descend according to the motion of the Law, or bestow them on
whom they belong in law, if any offense shall happen, it may only be imputed
to the offense of the law, by whose Act it is done without any partial respect
either of Names or other private affections, and who can be safer from
offending then he which contains himself within the compass and Buckler of
the Law, since sub clypeo legis nemo decipi dicitur? And by this policy
strangers, or remote Cousins, shall not more triumph of your greater affection
then your natural and living Children; your Children shall neither tempt their
charity, nor repine to see their Cousens enriched with that which is their
right, nor repent their long observed duties to their fathers.

But otherwise well may they think that father unkind who prefers to a name
which properly is none of his, before his own blood which assuredly is his;
for it is plain, that another man his name cannot be mine, though pronounced
and written to all purposes like mine, since every name (be they alike or
unlike) is peculiar to distinguish every person, and cannot be common to
another man and to me, as Homo is to all men. But this my meaning is more
evidently declared in the Laws of Armory; for though my second Brother his
Son bears a name like mine to all purposes, yet as nullum simile est idem,
so in his Coat Armor which belongs to his name, he bears a Cressant for his
fathers difference, which difference shows the name and coat to be none of
mine, since to my Arms due to my name no difference belongs; whereas
contrariwise my Daughters by quartering my Coat Armor with their Husbands, do
most truly represent both my name and Arms, for as the Coat is known by the
name, so mutually the name is known by the Coat.

Since therefore we live in our heirs after our deaths, it were good policy
that as we respect our estates while we live, so we should provide in like
manner for those in whom we live after our deaths, viz. our lawful heirs.
And he that disposes his Inheritance otherwise, in my opinion does like him
that has a Hat made for his head, and wears it on his heel; or like him that
gives all to his Cousins or friends till he beg himself.

Since therefore the Laws of nature (which cannot be dispensed withal) are
contrary to estates in special tail, in that most entailes convey unnaturally
our Inheritances from our heirs to others, since the Divine written Laws have
expressed a form of inheriting contrary to the form of all entailes, which
we ought not to alter, because praeceptum posuit, et non praeteribit, Psalm
144. and since the Common Laws of this Realm do expostulate their ancient
forms of Inheritances, as most commodious for public good, and since the
statutes of this present time have committed power into your hands, whereby you
may either benefit or prejudice your heirs, for qui non defendit injuriam
neque propulsat a suis cum potest, injuste facit, and since nemini vim et
injuriam facere videtur qui suo jure utitur. Since the statute of West 2.
neither commands, forbids, nor punishes, but is only a permissive
authority to do that which before the Statute was unlawful. And to conclude
with Laws, since as Saint Thomas says, nituntur leges humana cognintione
atque humana prudentia, per quam non potest satis certo constituere de futuris,
and since succeeding inconveniences by their common events have compelled our
forefathers to make breach into their conditional gifts, in acknowledging the
errors of them that first craved this liberty, I cannot see why you should any
longer continue that which deserves to be altered, except you think
inventions of men better then the Laws of God. And heresies in Law (which are
said to be sometimes de immunitate) better then the ancient positive Laws of
this Realm, except you think that nature have more bound you to advance others
then your own Children, except you think that other men have begotten better
Children then your self, except you more respect a like name of another then
the true descent of your own blood, except you mind to sow hatred among your
consanguinity, except you intend to offer open wrong to your heir, for paria
sunt malefacere, et malefacta non obviare, and except you would vainly and
Babylonically erect a Tower against the omnipotent power of God himself, which
building cannot long stand, nor prosper. Be not therefore I beseech you, misled
with the bad example of many that have bin negligent in cutting off entailes,
for non minus ardebunt qui cum multis ardebunt, and multitudo delinquentium non
excusat peccatum, and though therefore many do offend in this manner as
offenders for company, let them remember the fearful curse pronounced by the
Prophet Esa 24. terra infecta est ab habitatoribus suis qui transgressi sunt
leges, mutaverunt jus, et dissipaverunt foedus sempiternum: propter hoc
maledictio vorabit terram. And this I do the rather apply to my present
purpose, because I could never (after long observation) find any family
continue in the heirs male three discents after an entaile made and continued
to the heirs male, by which I guess they are not watered with heavenly
blessings. And with this I will conclude, saying that I will add one doubt,
viz. that though you will forbear to cut off the entaile, yet are you not
sure, that they to whom you will leave it will do so, and if they cut it off,
you shall join hands with them in an unnatural act.

FINIS.
