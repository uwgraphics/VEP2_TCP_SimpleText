THE NEWGATE Salutation: OR, A DIALOGUE between Sir W. W. and Mrs. Cellier.
To the Tune of, The Fight is now ended.
1.
OLd stories of State grow now out of date,
And Factious Promoters obstructed by Fate;
Great Charles in his Throne Protects Us alone,
Without those wild Maggots that Calvin has blown;
And now in the calm a Reflection I Will make,
Of a kind Salutation in Newgate of late.
2.
Twixt a Knight of the Cause, whose great Eminence,
By Popish Rat-catching, and smooth Impudence;
Beloved by all those that are the Kings Foes,
Yet in the Reception he dreaded some blows;
For when Fire and Water by accident greet,
Those unruly Elements calsh when they meet.
3.
And downright Dame Cellier, who still keeps her place,
To which He preferred her with Marks of Disgrace:
But now they are met in Newgate to Treat,
Id'e freely give Six Pence you had seen the Set.
For She was Transported, and stood in a maze,
Whilst He like and Owl among Lapwings did gaze.
4.
He snuffl'd with his Nose, and made a long pause,
In's New-fashion'd Cloak he wrapped up the Old Cause,
And cried Madam Cellier, I hope we are Friends;
Were now in my Power I Would make you amends.
Pray turn not my Stomach with lancing old Sores,
My sque^zy Misfortunes are far worse than yours.
5.
Great Sir! You are welcome unto this Great House,
I scorn to throw Water upon a drowned Mouse;
None of my Relations I have seen this year,
Could be half so welcome should they be brought here.
Your great Vigilance, and your Zeal does surpass,
In Courage, Don Quixot; in Zeal, Hudibrass.
6.
In The silent of Night, no Goblin nor Spright,
Could e're work such Wonders as you did Sir Knight,
in finding out Priests without help of Christ.
You were the Knight Errant on all such Exploits;
No Janus's two Faces, nor Argus's strange Eyes,
E're bilkt up their Fortunes, like you by surprise.
7.
Though you were betrayed by Oats and his Bums;
Those Amber Necklaces like Beads on your Thumbs,
Supplied you with Coin Sir those Debts for to pay,
Besides those Rich Medals in ambush for Prey;
Or some score of Pounds Bedingf. (pulled out on's Bed)
Though two years at least after he had been dead.
8.
Gusman to your Worship was but a mere Sot,
He never had Sense to find out a Sham Plot;
But you by the Art Sir of I egerdemain,
What you put in the Meal Tub, could fetch out again;
But all you near Jugglers Consederates do keep,
As my Maid and you in the Meal Tub did meet.
9.
The Knight in his passion found Truth would consute,
St. Francis then entered to end the Dispute.
Sir, This is no place for your Safety and Honor,
She Is void of the Light which the Cause upon her.
Come give me your Hand Sir into my own Room,
To consult who supply's our kind Ladies at home.
10.
Now since we are informed the Knight in got loose,
Yet finding some Clause of his Case in the noose
Wrapped up in the tangle, Great Charles he did dunne,
To Pardon his Treasons, what is past, and to come.
But an answer most fit I hope he did receive,
For a Treacherous Fool, and a sly buisy Knave.
