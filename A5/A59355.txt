TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Sir THOMAS LANE, Knight, LORD MAYOR of the City of
LONDON.
My Lord,
BEfore I congratulate Your Lordship's happy Inauguration to the Pretorial
Dignity, I must first pay my duteous Veneration to the Merit that advanced You
thither. Your Lordship had that Remarkable Triumph in Your Election, that when
You stood Candidate for the Chair, You brought so fair a Mass of Virtues to
intitule You to that Pretention, that instead of Doubts and Scrutinyes, the
tedious Disputes and Jars of Voices and Parties, too common in too many
Elections, 'twas enough for such Merit as Sir Thomas Lane's only to enter the
Lifts and carry the Conquest. Divided Favors were utterly Strangers there.
Your Lordship was that universal Darling that less than an hour began and
concluded the Choice; insomuch that there wanted no more to fix Your Lordship's
Wreath of Honor, then only to present the Brow that wears it.

And as Magistracy, especially in so high a Station, as Your Lordship's, is no
less then the immediate Lievtenancy of Majesty, the Deputy and Representative
of Sovereign Power, Your Lordship makes Your Entry to that Honorable Post of
Trust with all those eminent Advantages, as must fully answer the Expectation
of the World. For You bring with You, that Vivacity and Sprightlyness of a fair
and Active Youth to undertake it, a Genius and a Soul, and all the warmth of a
Public Spirit to execute it; and to both these, that unshaken Fidelity to
Crown the Hand that holds it. Nay not to want even the least Ornament or
Decoration of Dignity, You bring a Person too even to grace the Honor You wear.

Thus as a Vigilant and Faithful Magistrate is a true Crown Jewel, Your Prince
and Your Country, those two great Ascendants, being Your Lordships whole
Influencing Powers, You challenge all the Qualifications for the Highest and
clearest Luster that that truly Royal Jem can bear.

Nay Your Accession to Magistracy gives us this particular Observation, that
Your Lordship enters the Seat, left You so warm with the Merit that filled it
before You, to whose worth and Virtues Your Lordship brings not only a
Succession, but an Alliance too. Thus as the Encouragement of Religion, and the
Suppression of Vice have been so Exemplar a Labor and Endeavor before You,
Your Lordship Approaches enricht with those Principles and that Zeal, for the
effectual keeping up those Sacred Fasces of Authority so descended and lodged
in Your Hand; that all Good Men live in hopes that such Leading Originals may
stand as lasting Patterns even to latest Generations And thus in this great
Work so well begun and so continued, though Your Lordship's Dignity is that
Honor which You hold but one short Year, nevertheless, You will lay those
Foundations of that Glory as will last to Ages; in which true Propheticks, give
me leave to Write my self,

My Lord, Your Lordships* most Dutiful Servant, E. SETTLE.

TO THE Honorable Company OF CLOTHWORKERS.
Gentlemen,
IN my Address to the Company of Clothworkers, I am entered within those Walls
that lead me to a very fair Survey of no common Worth and Merit. For I may
justly concede You this Fair Renown, viz. That the whole Grandeur of England is
in a high measure owing to your worthy Society. For as the Gold of our Fleece,
and the Wealth of our LOOM is in a manner our whole English Peru: And the back
of the Sheep, and not the Entrayls of the Earth is our chief Mine of Riches.
The Silkworm is no Spinster of ours; and our Wheel and our Webb, Gentlemen,
are all your own.

Thus as Trade is the lifeblood of the English Nation, and indeed the very
Supporter of the Crown; so the greatest Branch of the English Trade lies in the
Clothworkers Hands. Our Floating Castles, I confess, Our Naval Commerce, bring
us in both the Or and the Argent, and indeed the whole wealth of the World:
They bring it in, it is true, but when thoroughly examined, it is Your CLOTH sends
out to fetch 'em. And thus whilst the Imperial Britannia is so formidable to
her Foes, and so potent to her Friends, her Strength and her Power, when duly
considered, to the Clothworkers Honor I may justly say, it is Your Shuttle
nerves her Arm, and Your Woof that enrobes her Glory.

But not to insist upon that single Merit alone, the Extent of Your Trade, and
the Reputation You have acquired, these being no more than the common work of
Your Industry; no, I have a Diviner Theme before me, the Hundreds of Your poor
Pensioners that yearly taste Your Bread, and wear Your Cloth, a Cloth so worn,
possibly the fairest Web in Your whole Loom.

Nor, Gentlemen, is Your Bounteous Goodness bounded here, Your Charity confined
within Your own Gates, Your own Hospitable Roof only: but Your more spreading
Acts of Mercy and Humanity have a yet larger Extent. Those two fair Sisters,
the Universities, both Rivals to Your kind Favors, lay their equal claim to
Your Gracious Smiles, witness your constant and generous Exhibitions, Your
cherishing Hand toward the Nursery of Arts and Sciences.

Thus not only our great Channel of Trade runs through the worthy Clothworkers,
but the two Great Fountains of Learning too must acknowledge You their Patrons
and Benefactors. Nay, Your goodness deseends to cherish Literature, even in
Inferior Schools of Youth, supported and maintained by You; and not only so
but communicates its cherishing warmth to Age and Gray Hairs; when besides Your
Pensioners at home, so many Almshouses of both Sexes look up to the Honorable
Clothworkers for their feeding Hand.

In recounting the Clothworkers Worth, not to walk further into so spacious a
Field, it is sufficient that Your Charity alone displays You truly Honorable.
For Charity as it is the highest Heavenly Virtue, so ir carries likewise the
highest worldly Honor too. For whatever great Names and gay Scutcheons, those
emptier Blazons of Worth and Dignity may pretend; there is no Grandeur nor
Magnificence equals this. For even Statues and Pyramids are but faint
Memorials, and speak but dead Praise; whilst fed Mouths and clothed Nakedness
are the living Monuments of Honor. The cheerful and Thankful Prayers of the
Poor are of all the loudest Trumps of Fame, for their sound reaches Heaven, and
makes the sweetest and most greatful Music there.

And Gentlemen, as those soft Airs create so divine a Harmonies; to increase
that tuneful Quire, may You never want that generous and continued Succession
of Charity, those daily Benefactors with full Hands and open Hearts, who in
pious emulation of the fair Examples before 'em, shall study to copy from such
Illustrious Patterns; so feed the hungry Bellies, so cover the naked Backs, and
so warm the chilling Roofs, till in reward of the drooping Heads they raise
here below, they come to crown their own above; which with last hearty wish

I am GENTLEMEN, Your most humble Servant. E. SETTLE.

There his Lordship, and the several Companys landing from their Respective
Barges, the rest of the Attendants that went not to Westminster, waiting for
his Reception, the whole Body moves in Order before him to Cheap Side, where
his Lordship is saluted with the First Pageant.

The First PAGEANT.
The Seat of SOVEREIGNTY.
A Stately Pyramid stands erected upon four Rich Columns wreathed round with
Golden Laurel, and other Ornaments. Round this chief Pyramide upon the Corinsh
of the Columns stand four smaller Pyramids, all of them hung with Trophies as
being the Acquisitions of Sovereign Power. In the front of the Pageant, sits
Augusta representing London, with three other Figures, viz. Concord, Prudence,
and Justice. Beneath are planted 4 Figures more, viz. Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America, the other four Thames, Tyber, Nile and Indus. Intimating that the
whole World, by way of Trade and Commerce contributes to the Wealth and
Grandeur of London. The whole Prgeant is duly applied to My Lord, as being the
Representative of Majesty within the City of London.

Augusta's SPEECH.
WHilst proud Augusta, thus Majestic Great,
Circled with Trophies fills her Royal Seat.
Augusta, her just Praises to rehearse,
Of all her Sisters of the Universe,
The fairest noblest Town; My Sovereign Thames
No less a Vassal than the Ocean claims,
Whilst Tributary Worlds their Homage yield:
My Glorious Brow, Wealth, Power, and Honor Guild.
Wealth, Honor, Power, it is true, my Pyramids build:
But Virtue and fair Industry alone,
It Is they support my State, and found my Throne.
And that Great Work, my Lord, belongs to You;
Fair Virtues propagation is Your due.
Encouraged Piety, cherisht Industry,
Corrected Vice must Your great Province be,
And whilst Your Lordship's Smiling Influence,
To happy London shall it is warmth dispense;
With Rosy Garland I Will adorn my Towrs,
I Will wear them Sir, but You shall plant my Flowers.
The Second PAGEANT.
The Garden of PLENTY.
ON a large Stage at each end are planted four Flowr potts richly embossed with
Gold, over these arises a Rich Arbor all sumptuously decked with Flowr's and
Fruit of Gold, and out of four less Flower Pots more, above the Arch, these
Pots likewise of Gold, issue fair Trees, adorned with several Fruits and
Flowr's, and over all is hanged a Golden Fleece. Beneath this Arbor sits Jason,
as the Capital Figure with a Dragon in a large Shield, who conquered the Dragon
to obtain the Golden Fleece.

This Pageant is entirely applicable to the Honorable Clothworkers, the Fleece
being a Golden one, Morally so represented by Virtue of the Riches arising from
the Manufacture of the Fleece. That the Dragon being a watchful Creature,
intimates the Caution Industry and Vigilance that ought to secure support and
preserve Trade; whilst Jason that gave the Dragon a sleeping Potion, and so
carried away the Golden Fleece was in reality an Industrous Merchant that
equipt his Ship the Argonant, and by Traffic and commerce carried off the
Golden Flerce viz. the Trade of the World. Jason is attended by 3 other Figures
representing Commerce, Navigation and Industry. (...)

Jason's SPEECH.
JAson of Old was a bold Youth of Greece,
Subdued a Dragon for a Golden Fleece.
A fairer Wreath Your Lordship's Worth attends,
For here proud London's prostrate Dragon bends.
So just a Hand with Powr's Regalia graced;
Honor and trust were never nobler placed.
And, Sir, if great Examples could but teach,
The imitating World Their heights to reach,
Your Leading Virtue, such deserts to Crown,
From the kind* Heaven's must pull those Blessings down,
Till this Blessed Town shall my Rich Treasures hold,
Reap both my Golden Fruit and Fleece of Gold.
The Chariot of APOLLO.
A Very Rich Chariot is drawn by two Golden Griffons the Supporters of the
Honorable Company of Clothworkers; in the Chariot is seated Apollo, who as the
God of Wisdom and also God of the Day, was a Shepherd to King Admetus, and is
properly applied to the Clothworkers as that under his Beams both the Sheep
and the Shepherd are warmed and cherisht. Upon the approach of my Lord, when
Apollo arises to address him, a Rich Figure of the Rising Sun of above 10 foot
Diameter, not seen before, appears above his Head out of the back of the
Chariot with all his Beams displayed in Gold* On each Griffon ride two
Triumphant Figures.

Apollos SPEECH.
RIse Rise my Sun; with Your full Orb ascend*
TO Augustas Lord Your Brighest Luster lend.
Thus the Homaging Apollo bends before ye,
To hail Your fair Inauguration Glory.
Your Reigning Virtue and my smiling Day,
Shall equally their Cherishing Beams display.
Wisdom and Justice are that awful Power,
Commands the Stars: Nor can my Sun do more,
Hail thou Great Sir, to a propitious Year,
Till You Your Orb: as I my glittering Sphere.
Your glorious Chair with my proud Chariot join,
To warm and cheer the World, together shine.
The Fourth Pageant of TRADE.
IN this Pageant is the whole Art and Mystery of the Clothworkers expressed, by
all manner of Persons actually concerned in all Branches of the Trade, as
Carding, Combing, Spinning, Rolling, Shearing of Wool, etc. The chief Figure is
Jack of Newbury in his proper Habit upon a Rich Seat erected for him. In the
Front of the Pageant is placed the Golden Ram the Crest of the Worshipful
Company, the Pageant a very large one, being filled with several persons in
Rurale and Pastoral Habits Dancing and rejoicing with their Pipes and other
Country Music suitable to their Characters, and also to the Solemn Joys of the
Day.

Jack of Newbury's SPEECH.
Amongst Your prouder Train in this great Day,
Here Is Jack of Newbury does his hontage pay.
It Is true, My Lord, I am but a homely Guest,
Plain Jack, an honest Clothier of the West.
But in that Name I more than Titles wore.
My Fleece and Loom that golden Harvest bore
As fed whole Thousands. What can Princes more?
Trade was my Honor; Trade does Riches bring,
And Riches make Companions for a King.
Tho Jack of Newbury so famed in Story,
Was once the Clothworkers Renown and Glory,
My Poorer name Your Lordships shall out shine.
Be You Your Ages Honor, as I mine.
A SONG.
I.
COme all the nine Sisters, that fill the Great Quire,
For here is a Rich Theme must the Muses inspire.
The Clothworkers Glory
So fair lies before ye;
So famous and ancient their Honor begun,
When Adam first delv'd and our Mother Eve spun.
II.
Nor the Gold nor the Pearl old England shall lack.
You send out Your Cloth and the Indies come back.
On your fair Foundation
The Wealth of the Nation,
Our Wool and our Web, the Supporters of Crowns,
It Is Wooll-Sacks found Bridges, and Fleeces build Towns.
III.
Whilst through twelve Starry Signs, as Astronmers say,
To circle the Year, drives the great God of Day.
Through Aries and Taurus
Triumphant and glorious,
Whilst the Ram in the Heavens does so splendid appear,
It Is the Clothworkers Crest begins the Fair-Year.
IV.
Two Griffons of Gold, your Supporters so fair,
Those compounds of Lion and Eagle wait there.
The Lion it is true Sirs
In homage to you Sirs,
As Lord of the Land, and the Eagle of the Air,
To the Clothworkers glory their Fealty bear.
V.
The Thistle, the Clothworkers Servant so kind,
Long glit ring in Gold in their Scutheon has shined;
The Thistle it is true, Sirs,
To give her her due, Sirs,
With the fair English Rose, both of Royal Renown,
To the Clothworkers Honor, the Thistle and Crown,
VI.
Since Fortune's but Whele, and the great Book of Doom.
With Life but a Thread is tbe work of the Loom,
The Fates those dire Sisters
Our Destiny Twisters;
It Is Clothworking all. For Living or Dead,
It Is he is only blessed that spins a fair Thread.
FINIS.
