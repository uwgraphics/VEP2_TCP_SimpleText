of Iersey.

Presented TO THE HONORABLE The Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, of the Commons
House of Parliament.

Printed Anno Dom. 164^

TO THE HONORABLE The Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of the Commons House
of Parliament.
The humble Petition of William Prynne, late exile and close Prisoner in the
I Will of Iersey.
In all humbleness shows.

THat your Petitioner, though not conscientious to himself of any voluntary or
apparent offense against the Laws of the Realm (to which he ever studied to
conform himself) through the malicious practices and persecutions of some
Prelates and Churchmen (especially the now Archbishop of Canterbury, and
Peter Heylin, Doctor in Divinity) whose errors and innovations, contrary to the
Doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, and extravagancies, in the High
Commission and other Ecclesiastical Courts, your Petitioner for his own
relief, being there uniustly prosecuted (had to his wo^ke power oppugned) has
within eight years last past, undergone two heavy Censures in the
Star Chamber Court.

The first upon an Information there exhited against your Petitioner, by Mr.
Noy, deceased, then Attorney General, for some misconstrued passages,
inoffensive in themselves, and in your Petitioners true intention, being for
the most part the words of other approved Authors, comprised in a Book,
styled Histrio-mastix, written by the Petitioner, against common Interludes,
and lycensed for the Press by M. Thomas Buckner, household Chaplain to the
then Archbishop of Canterbury, authorized by the State to lycense Books, and
by him exactly perused and approved both in the written and Printed Copy,
before its publication, and so confessed in the Information; for which
authourized Book and passages, your Petitioner before the hearing of the
cause, was not only imprisoned in the Tower of London without Bail of
Manuprise, for a whole years space, denied access to his Counsel, convenient
time to examine witnesses, and make Breviats to instruct his Counsel (the
information being General, and reciting no particular Clauses of the Book
excepted against) this exhibits, the only means of his defense, Illegally
sppressed: some of his Council Tampered with to make no Justification,
contrary to your Petitioners instructions, and desire, whereby his cause was
miscarried: But also at the Hearing, by reason of those malicious and perverse
glosses on the said passages, which the said Heylin had collected and presented
to his Majesty's learned Counsel, who repeated his Instructions only; your
Petitioner was fined 3000l. to his Majesty, expelled the University of Oxford,
and Lincolnes-Inne, degraded from his profession of the Law, wherein he never
offended, Set in the Pillory in the Pallace-yard at Westminister, where he lost
one of his Ears; And two days after on the Pillory in Cheapeside, where he
lost the other Ear, and had his said Lycensed Books there publicly burnt
before his face, by the Hangman, in a most disgraceful manner; and aiudged
after to remain a prisoner during his life.

That after the said censure, to defame and iniure your Petitioner the more,
he was charged wrongfully in the Decree, as censured for Perjury, (though not
taxed for it by the Court) and between his sufferings in the Pillory, the
Books of his Study (twice survayed, and restored to him by order from the
Lords) before any (fine estreated) by a warrant out of the High Commission
signed by the said Archbishop and others, were seized by on Cross a
messenger, who carried them to his house, with which your Petitioner charging
the said Archbishop upon occasion, in the open Court of Starchamber; he there
publicly disavowed the same (though your Petitioner can yet produce it under
his own hand) promising withal, that the Books should be restored forthwith;
which notwithstanding were all still detained by his means, till they were
extended and sold for your Petitioners Fine: Who shortly after by an order out
of the said Court, sent to the Tower to be executed, was there shut up close
prisoner, and Doctor Rheeves sent thither to search his Chamber for the
Pamphlet, which the said Arch Bishop would wrongfully have Fathered upon your
Petitioner, whose friends have been unjustly prosecuted in the Exchequer, and
elsewhere sundry years, for his Fine aforesaid.

And your Petitioner further says, that about Faster was three years, during
his imprisonment in the Tower, by means of the said Arch-B^shop, a new
information was exhibited in the said Court against your Petitioner, and
others, with certain Books thereto annexed; Denying the Prelates Jurisdiction
over other Ministers, to be Iure-divino. Charging them with money errors and
Innovations in Religion, Usurpation upon his Majesty's Prerogative, and Subucts
liberty, Abuses, and extortions in the High Commission, And other
Ecclesiastical Courts, suppressing Preaching, And pain-full Ministers without
a cause; Lycensing Popish, Armintan, and other Erroneus Books against the
Sabbath, setting up Altars, Images and Crucifixes, Removing and Railing in
Communion Tables, and bowing down to them, Altering the Book of Common
Prayer, The Books for the Gunpowder Treason, And late Fast in some Material
passages in favor of Popery and Papists.

Which thing (though very notorious, and often complained against by this
Honorable House, in former und late Parliaments) were yet reputed Scandalous.
And though neither of the said Books was perticularly charged on your
Petitioner, in the said Information, nor any witness produced to prove him
either Author or disperser of any of them, yet by denying your Petitioner
liberty to draw up his own Answer, (though once a Baristor at Law) when as
his assigned Counsel refused to do it, by close Imprisoning your Petitioner,
and his Servant, by debarring him Pen, Ink, and Paper, whereby to Answer, or
instruct his Counsel, searching his chamber, and taking away part of his
Answer there found, denying him Access, to his Counsel, and conference with
his Co-defendants, even at Counsel, though jointly charged with him, Rejecting
the Cross Bill exhibited by him for his defense; threatening Master Holt, one
of your Petitioners assigned Council, sent by the then Lord Keeper to the
Tower, to draw up your Petitioners Answer, and commanding him not to sign it,
after it was engrossed: Whereupon he refused to subscribe it, contrary to his
promise to your Petitioner, and by refusing to accept your Petitioners Answers
to the said Information, signed with his own, and Master To^^lins, the other
of his Counsels hands, though tendered by your Petitioner, both at the
Star Chamber Office, and in the open Court at the hearing the said Information,
for default of Answer, (though two Answers were thereto tendered by your
Petitioner) was taken Pro confesso against your Petitioner, and he thereupon
Fined five thousand pounds to his Majesty, Pillored, Stigmatized on both
cheeks, Mutilated and dismembered, in a most Barberous manner, and the small
remainder of his Ears, left after his first execution, out off, to the hazard
of his hearing, and life, Adjudged to perpetual close imprisonment in the
Goalt of Carnarvan castle in North Wales, a Nasty. Dog-hole, far remote from
your Petitioners Friends. Which sentence was undu'ly drawn up and executed
upon your Petitioner, as his Atturneys Clerk informed him, before it was
entered into the Book, or your Petitioner could get any Copy of it, to except
against the same, as he had just cause.

That immediately after the execution of the same sentence, your Petitioner
sent to the said Archbishop to desire him to release, or Bail his servant
(who was detained close prisoner for ten weeks space in the messengers hands,
and often examined and solicited by fair promises, and threatenings causlessely
to accuse your Petitioner, against whom they wanted evidence) that so he might
attend him during his soars, which the said Archbishop out of his Grace and
Charity, utterly refused: saying that he intended to proceed against his said
servant in the High Commission, where he has ever since vexed, censured and
banded him from Prison to Prison, only for refusing to accuse and betray your
Petitioner.

That after the said heavy sentence, your Petitioner by an order in the said
Court, (by way of addition to the said Censure) was inhibited the use of Pen,
Ink and Paper, and all Books, except the Bible, and the Book of
Common Prayer, and some few Books for private Devotion, and before his wounds
were perfectly cured, he was by order removed from the Tower to Carnarvan; and
some of his friends in Chester, who visited him there in his passage, in the
presence of his Conductors, who had no order to restrain any person from
resorting to him, were for this very cause sent for by a Messenger, to appear
before the Lords of the Privy Counsel, and likewise cited into the
High Commission at York, where they were imprisoned, and fined, to the ruin
of their estates, enjoined to make a public Recantation in the Cathedral
Church, and in the Towne-Hall of Chester. The said Commissioners further
decreeing that three pictures of your Petitioners found in Chester, should be
publicly burnt at the high Cross there, which was done accordingly.

That your Petitioner since his said sentence, has been publicly reviled at,
and libelled against, both by the High Commissioners at York, and in sundry
Churches, both at Chester, and else where, and in diverse licensed printed
books compiled by the said Heylin, and published by the Archbishops privity
or command, and that sundry of his friends houses, studies, Books, and
writings have been violently broken up, ransacked and taken away, and
themselves prosecuted in the High Commission, out of malice, for the relation
they had to your Petitioner.

That after your Petitioner had continued some ten weeks space close prisoner
in Carnarvan, he was about three years since by a warrant from the Lords of the
Counsel, made in the summer vacation (to which the said Arch Bishops hand was
first subscribed) ordered by way of Exile, to be imbarqued and transported with
all privacy into one of the Castles in the Isle of Iersey, and his conductors
thereby charged not to admit any person whatsoever, but themselves only, to
speak with vour Petitioner in his passage: whereupon after some injuries there
received by Mr. Griffith, the Kings Attorney in those parts (who endeavored to
seize upon the furniture of his chamber for his own use) your Petitioner was
imbarqued amongst Papists, in a bruised ship-wrackt vessel, full of leakes,
and after fourteen weeks voyage in the Winter season, through dangerous
storms and seas, which spoiled most of his stuff and bedding, and threatening
often shipwreck to him, he arrived at the said Isle, and was conveyed close
prisoner into Mount Orgatile Castle, there where the Lieutenant Governor by an
other extrajudiciall Order, to which the said Archbishops name was first
ordered, to keep your Petitioner close prisoner in a chamber, suffer none but
his keepers to speak with him, to intercept all letters to him; to permit him
neither Pen, Ink nor Paper, either to write to his friends for necessaries, or
to petition for relief, and to permit him no Book but the Bible, and those
aforenamed books, without giving any order for his diet there, so that being
deprived of his calling and estate, exiled and shut up close prisoner among
strangers, remote from all his friends, denied all adresse to him by person or
letters, he had certainly perrished in his almost three years close
imprisonment there, had not the extraordinary providence and goodness of God
(which he shall ever adore) and the noble charity of those, under whose custody
he did remain, furnished him with such diet and necessaries, as diet him both
in health and life, in this his close imprisonment and exile.

May it therefore please this Honorable House, to take these your Petitioners
almost eight years tragical grievances, of new and dangerous example, into
your most sad and just cosiderations, that so they may not become presidents to
the prejudice of posterity; to grant him liberty to send for, and examine all
necessary witnesses: to order all Clerks, Registers, and other officers of the
Star Chamber, or elsewhere, speedily and freely to grant him the copies of such
orders, decrees and writings, as his cause shall require, to release him upon
Bale, (being now but a prisoner upon an extrajudiciall order of the Lords, and
not by virtue of any sentence or decree in Court) to grant him liberty to plead
and prosecute his own cause, since Counsel has so often failed him, and to
give him such satisfaction and relief as the justice and equity of his cause
shall merit.

And your Petitioner shall ever pray for you safeties, WILLIAM PRYNNE.
