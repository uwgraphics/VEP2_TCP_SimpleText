MEMORIAL To the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, anent the English Clipped
Money, and other Current Coins in Scotland.
COnsidering the great Diminution of the intrinsic Value of the English Money
by Clipping, without doubt they will use all Endeavors to lodge as much of the
Loss thereof upon us as possible they can, and that with all Diligence
imaginable; especially the Parliament of England being to fall upon some Course
for redressing the same, and preventing the like for the future: It does
therefore concern us in this Kingdom to prevent any loss we may sustain by the
Fault of others.

The Remedy appears to be Twofold, First, to call down the Value of the
English clipped Money, and then to call up or raise the Value of the other
Current Coins of Scotland, whether Foreign or Domestic.

For the first, it is most reasonable that the current Value of Moneys should
be lessned, according as the intrinsic Value is lessned, and the intrinsic
Value of English clipped Money being lessned by Clipping to a third Part, and in
some Species to a half loss of the Value of what it was at first, it ought
certainly to be undervalued accordingly.

All that can be said against it, appears to be of no great weight, for the
loss of particular persons who are possessed of that Clipped Money, will still
prove greater and greater; As also that of the Nation in general, so long as
there is not an adequat Remedy found out for freeing the Nation of the same,
though with loss, and preventing the like for the time to come: And in one
Word, this appears to be the only Reason why our current Coin is carried forth
of the Kingdom, because the English after they have had the benefit of Clipping
their own Money, they send down theirs when light, to barter with our Goods and
heavy Money, whereby their Advantage is as great as our Loss is.

It is not to be regairded, that if such Measure be taken with us, the English
will buy none of our Beasts and Goods, for what they by from us is for their
own Advantage, and not for ours; And if it be for their Advantage to to buy
from us, they can make their payments in Bills of Exchange as they did
formerly: And it is observable, that since the Clipping of their Money, their
Payments for Scots Commodities has been by the Species of Money, Ten, for one
more than what their Payments were formerly.

If therefore some speedy and effectual Course be not fallen upon for
preventing the Prejudice we sustain by the Clipped Money, it will both take away
all Encouragement from the Importers thereof, and give Encouragement to the
Exporters of the same, and prevent the Exportation of our other Current Coins,
and the less Value ye set upon the Clipped Money, the more Value you set upon the
unclipt, which is equivalent to raising the Value thereof, and will prove as
great an Encouragement for the Importing of the unclipt Species of Money, as if
it were actually called up to a higher Value than for what it past formerly in
this Kingdom.

As to the second Remedy, its believed by some, that the raising of the current
Coyns of a Kingdom, in value will cause it to be imported in hope of gain, and
keep it from being exported, for fear of loss.

The first view of things are often pleasant, when the end and Progress thereof
is not.

For it is certain, that one Ounce of Silver of equal finness, is, and allwise
will be of equal value with an other Ounce of Silver of the same finness, all
the world over.

And it is as certain, that Money is not only the true measure of all our other
Means and Riches in the Kingdom, but also of our Foreign Commerce with
Strangers, which therefore ought to be kept just and constant, to avoid these
confusions, which ever accompany such alterations.

For first at home, if the common measure be changed, our Lands, Rents, and
Commodities both Foreign and Domestic must alter in proportion, indeed those
who are to borrow or receive Money upon former Contracts, will be defrauded of
their due proportionably, as the Money is raised above its former value which
they would soon find to their great loss, if they went to Market with their new
Money; if the stranger Merchant, or those of our own Nation bring in Foreign
Wars, and find the Money raised, shall not they raise the price of their
Commodities proportionably, and shall not the price of the Merchants Exchange
with Foreign Countries, rise in proportion with our Money, and consequently
why may not our Moneys be carried out of the Country, to as much profit, as
before the alteration.

If it be thought, that the raising of it, will cause foreign Money come in,
it must be done either by the Merchant who has exported our Wars; or by the
Merchant who intends to buy of our Commodities; or by him who brings in
Foreign Coin, as Merchandise to gain upon it, according to the value its
raised with us.

For the first if the value called up, be but small, it will bring in little or
no Treasure, because the Merchant will rather bring in Wars, upon which, there
is usually a competent gain.

As to the second, there will be as little Encouragment, because the price of
Commodities will raise in value proportionably, as our Money does.

And as to the third, its the same thing, for if they bring Money upon the
expectation of Advantage, they must either receive the value thereof, in Money,
Goods, or by Bills of Exchange, by the first, there can be no Advantage because
Money is the same with Money, and the Goods raise proportionably, as said is;
neither by the last, because the price of Exchange raising proportionally will
take from the one hand what is gained by the other: for the Merchants Exchange
by Bills is a practice, whereby they that have Money in one Country, may give
in the same to receive Money again in an other Countay, upon certain conditions
agreed upon; whereby Merchants are accomodated, without transporting of
Treasure.

These Exchanges are not made at equal Values of the Moneys only, because he
that delivers his Money has regard to the hazard of the Debt and time of
forbearance, but that which causes really and truly an under or over-valueing
of Money by exchange, is the plenty or scarcity thereof, where exchanges are
made, and as that makes the price of exchange high or low, so the over or under
balance of our tread does certainly occasion plenty or scarcity of Money.

For suppose Holland, or England import more Goods in value to us than we sell
them, then it is evident their Merchants not only carry away our Treasure to
balance Accounts between us and them, but also money being to be delivered by
us to them by exchange, it is therefore undervalued by the Receivers whatever
overvalue we may put upon it our selves, and this occasions the raise of
exchange.

But suppose on the other hand our current Coin should be so much undervalued
by us, as that ninety pounds being carried over in specie, would satisfy for
an hundred pounds at Amsterdam, yet that would never occasion the carrying out
of our Money, if it were not because of the overbalance of Trade: For suppose
the Wares brought from Holland, extend to the value of five hundred Pound
yearly, and our Commodities transported to them, only four hundred Pound
yearly, Is it not evident that there must be an hundred Pound of balance; and
this Loss must be though the returns were only in Money: For the Dutch carrying
away from us five hundred Pound of Money for their Wares, and we bringing home
four hundred Pound only of their Coin for our Commodities, there will be still
an hundred Pounds loss, and if our Money be so much undervalued more than
theirs, ninety Pounds carried over will pay that balance of an hundred Pound
at Amsterdam.

Again, suppose we carry as much Wares in value to Holland, as they bring in to
us; by which the means is equal for each to make their Returns by Exchange,
without carrying away money from either State, and that the Scots Merchants
should notwithstanding, bring his Returns in ready money, because of the
Advantage by the calling up of the money in Scotland. Yet it must of necessity
follow, that the Scots Merchant shall want as much means of Exchange with the
Dutch, as he brought money from them: for though some both export and import
Wares, some export, others import only; some deliver out their money by
Exchange, others take it up; some carries out money, and others bring it in:
yet all the money in a Country; that is not the true gain by the over balance
of Trade, must of necessity, be sent back to balance the Exchange. Whereby we
may plainly see, that what money is carried out within the balance of Trade,
tho overvalued by us, cannot be considerable; for it must of necessity return
to us again: and we lose only, and shall always lose those moneys which are
made without the balance of our Trade, let the species of our money be never
so much raised and overvalued.

These Circumstances being considered, the over-valueing of Money, either
Foreign or Domestic, will be found no good Expedient to promote the designed
Ends: Treasure cannot be forced into a Nation, to make it really ours, can only
be by a lawful Gain; this lawful Gain in a Nation, where there is no Silver or
Gold Miens, can be by no wise, but by the true and just balance of a well
adjusted Trade, and that is when their export exceeds their import: But on the
contrary, the prejudice will be so great, that it will confound the Property of
the Subject, lessen the Revenue of the King, occasion damnage to some men, give
unreasonable and unjust advantage to others, disturb the Affairs of the Nation
to no purpose, violate the Laws of Foreign Commerce; and if we were a Nation
that bore any bulk in Trade, might cause other Princes and States raise their
Coin in proportion with ours, settle Affairs of Commerce to our prejudice; and
then grant all the Advantages we propose to our selves, what will it signify?

If notwithstanding of what is said, Your Lordships shall think it necessar to
make some alterations of the value of current Coin, especial regard would be
had to the comparative value of it: For as an Ounce of Silver is alwise of an
equal intrinsic value everywhere, yet so there being no common Standard for
the intrinsic value of any thing more than what is put upon it by the general
and unanimous consent of People and Nations, it must necessarily follow, that
we ought to consider what value our neighbor Nations put upon the current Coin
of our Kingdom, whether Foreign or Domestic, and that in relation to these
particulars.

First, To consider and examine, if the Gold to Silver be of the like
proportionable Value in Scotland, as the Gold is to Silver in France, Spain,
Holland, and other Countries.

Secondly, to compare the alloye of Gold and Silver in Scotland, with that of
other Countries.

Thirdly, to consider if the Coin be of equal value with the current price of
Bullion, the charge of coining only deduced, if any reformation of our current
Coin be necessary, especial care must be had to these Considerations; for if
the value of Gold be raised above the value of silver, more than
proportionably, it will make us plenty of Gold. But all our money shall be
carried out with loss, and the Nation impaired in its Treasure, as it did in
England above thirty year ago, when Gold was called up ten of a hundred, and
Silver not proportionably. So if the Silver, or particular denominations of
Coin be raised, the one more than the other, or more than the Gold in
proportion, the same consequence will follow as to that of the Gold, and will
afford nothing but a Trade, and Barter of money with money, according to the
real and intrinsic value of the different species's, to the great prejudice of
the Trade, and impoverishing of the Nation.

For the last Consideration, it does not so properly belong to your Lordships
as to the High Court of Parliament; therefore shall say nothing of it.
