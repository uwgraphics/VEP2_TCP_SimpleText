The Preface.
TO write the Lives of Princes, in another world, and fallen, through their
own frailties, or by the influence of others counsels from the high pitch of
Sovereignty (for regality is a slippery precipice) in charity may be allowed a
fair and favorable memorial; but for a King falling by the high hand of
Justice, not for common faults and frailties (incident to humane nature) but
presumptuous sins, sins of lood, perfidie, cruelty, rapine, wilfully
perpetrated in the face of God and man, and without any remorse, to pursue the
destruction not of one, but three flourishing Kingdoms, such desperate and
violent Princes, deserve no other favor than to be set out to the life of
their Tyrannous actions; though in pity to him, who has already paid his debt
to Nature, and his offenses, much of his exorbitant government and irregular
motions might, and doubtless would have been concealed, more tenderly
entreated, and himself sufferered to rest where he is, in the silent grave,
had not that madness of his defeated surviving party by their indefatigable
instigations, given frequent occasion of taking over the ashes of him, who
living (without injury to truth and his memory it may be said) that rather than
to have failed in the accomplishing of his designs, (had it layn in in his
power) he would have set the World on fire. It was an unhappy and no
iningenious expression of Balzack.
him, who has written it, That there were a sort of men borne to the world,
not so suffer it to be at rest; a sentence not more true, than made good in
this most unhappy King, had this been put in addition (neither himself to take
his own rest, and sleep (as he could not) quietly and peaceably like other
men.)

I am not ignorant what senseless maxims and ridiculous principles have gotten
credit in the World (as undoubted Oracles indisputably to be obeyed) as that de
mortuis nil nisi bona, but by no means to tread on the sacred Urne of Princes,
though living never so vicious and exorbitant, as if death had bequeathed unto
them a supersedeas for the covering over their faults and licencious reigns,
and to close them up in the Coffin of Oblivion, with a ne plus ultra, not to
admit of the least mention that they had done amiss, when many thousands of
oppressed and desolated families must stand mute, whilst the malicious
partisans of an irregular King, take a liberty to themselves, to vindicate his
indefensible actions, and not so content, but asperse and scandalize those that
opposed him in his cruelties, and likewise would persuade others to adore him
for a Saint, and an innocent martyr, whose Fathers, Brothers, and Friends, have
been most barbarously slain to fulfill the lust and pleasure of one wilful
man: if to speak truth in due season, or to be the faithful witness to
convey the verity of things past to the present and after times, be a crime
unpardonable, or an injustice done to the memory of the dead, the Malignant
generation of this age may on the same reason charge it as a fault on those
holy and inspired penmen of the sacred Scriptures, which have recorded and
left to after ages the wicked reigns of Kings, leaving an everlasting stain
and taint on their memories; how profane would it be to tax that holy man (the
meekest of men) Moses, for leaving to posterity the fratricide of Cayne? the
mockery of that wicked Came? what madness to accuse Samuel, and the Authors of
the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah and Israel, in leaving to after ages the
Tyranny of Saul, in murdering at once eighty of Gods priests? that
presumptuous sin and perfidious fact of David, in plotting the death of Vriah,
that he might enjoy his Wife which lay in his bosom? Rehoboams Tyrannies? the
Cruelties and Idolatries of Jeroboam, who stands branded, as the Son of
Nebat, which made Israel to sin? with what face can it be imputed as an
incharity to Tacitus, Livy, Florus, and others of the Roman Historians, for
inserting in their histories, the rape of Lucretia by that Tyrant Tarquin? the
Tyrannies of Tiberius and his privado Scianus? those of Nero, that Monster of
Princes, and the condemnation of him by the Senate? To omit Foreign examples,
what offense in reason can be charged on Matthew Paris, Ho^eden, Sir Th. Moor,
Daniell, and infinite others, of our own Historians, for describing the vices
and tyrannies of our own Kings both ancient and modern? What injury have they
committed in their Registers, in setting down that William the first of our
Norman Kings, was a known Bastard of Robert Duke of Normandy, an usurper, and
from which spurious root all our Kings since his usurpation derive their
deified titles, and that most of his descendants ruled tyrannically, and that
amongst them all King John was one of the most subtle, persideous and bloody
Princes that history has afforded? That Henry the third his son (admitted by
the indulgence of the Barons and People in hopes of his better Government)
proved as oppressive and bloody to the Nation as any of the rest: That Richard
the third in murdering his Brothers sons, and usurping the Crown, was more
wicked than the worst? That Henry the seventh was the descendant of a Bastard
son of John of Gaunt, begotten on Catherine Swinford another man's Wife,
though legitimated by act of Parliament, yet had no other title to the Crown
but that of his Sword? That six of his descendants, and of our last Princes,
claym their rights to the Crown from his spurious stock (as if it had been in
the fate of the English Nation, to be perpetually chaind up to the irregular
domination of a race of Kings, transmitted from one bastardized root to
another? That Henry the eighth was a most imperious and bloody prince, the
pattern and Idea of all Tyranny, and one that neither spared any man in his
wrath, or woman in his Sir Walter Raleigh.
lust? That his daughter Queen Mary was the spurious issue begotten on
Catherine of Austria his elder brother Arthurs Wife, that Alecto, superstitious
and bloody Princess; That King James, and our late King Charles, were
discendants from the same Stock of Henry of Richmond, the one who most of all
our Kings secretly, cunningly, and underhand endeavored, and laid the plot to
undermine the freedoms of the english nation, and King Charles to have followed
the design with more plots, wiles, and stratagems, than any of our former
Kings, raised more treasure by undue exactions, and spilt more innocent blood
than all of the Norman Kings before him?

If the premises are evident truths, as they cannot be denied; why then should
they be concealed, and wrapped up from the sight of the world? being so pertinent
to be left as Looking glasses for their Successors to behold the deformed
faces of their Ancestors, so fit to be made known to the deluded number of the
people, baffled and befooled with flam's and Fig Leaves? what injury then or
injustice has the Parliament done to the Nation, in rescuing their Liberties
out of the hand of a King, which nothing would content, but their Invassalage?
what have they done more in cutting off him with his Posterity (to whom he had
entayled his designs) than necessity has enforced them to do, in preservation
of the Nation from that inevitable inthralldome, which eminently was like, and
would have befallen the universal people, had they not taken away the Effects
by the Cause, and by that Law of Necessity, to which all others are
subservient? And have they done more than the Romans of old have left in
president, in the case of Tarquinius, and the expulsion of his Posterity for
less Tyranny, and to change the Kingly Government into a Republic, when as
this most wilful Prince stood so constantly fixed to his depraved Principles,
that no persuasions of a Court of Parliament, no reason but his will could
prevail, or content him, but to be the absolute Master of such an immensity of
power, as that at his own time and pleasure might enable him, not only to
destroy himself, but to overpower the whole Kingdom, which to his uttermost he
endeavored, and to wade all over in blood to the accomplishment, as it is most
manifest by all his actions, and the sequel of his own story? And have not
the SCOTS on the same Reasons of State, in diverse presidents, acted the like on
their Kings, when they found them perverse and intractable to any reason, as
it is manifest in the fatal examples of Dardanus their 20. King from Fergus, in
Romacus their 36 King, and on Alpinus their 68 King, all three of them beheaded
for their Cruelties and Tyrannies; besides twenty more of their Kings, either
put to death or deposed for their exorbitant Governments? and has the
Parliament in this necessitated change of the late Kingly domination into a
Commonwealth done more than the Hollanders were compelled to attempt, and
happily accomplished in the very like case, when as on their many (though
fruitless, Petitions to Philip the second of the invading of their ancient
Immunities, and slaughtering of 100000 of the Natives by Don Alvares de Toledo,
and others of his Vice-Royes, and themselves utterly deprived of all hopes of
redress of their grievances, but only to make head against his Tyranny? This
question I take the liberty to move to the most rigid Royalist; by what right,
equity, or Law of God or man, is any Nation in the World bound up to such a
blind and unnatural obedience, as to be deprived of self-defence, and to sit
still without seeking their own preservations, whilst an irregular King shall
either cut their throats, inslave, or denude them of their Freedoms, when as
both Scripture and the Law of Nature and Nations allows it them? and that
Royalists themselves, and the most learned Jurists maintain and concur in one
joint opinion, that Subjects in such cases, both by Gods Law and that of
Nature, may defend themselves, contra immanem saevitiem, against barbarous
hostility, as Barclay adver. Monarch. lib. 3. cap. 8.
Barclay confesses, and Grotius de jure belli and pacis, lib. 1. cap. 4.
Hugo Grotius avoucheth it for Law, si Rex hostili animo in totius populi
exitium feratur, amittit Regnum, If a King in a hostile way shall attempt to
destroy his people, he loses his Kingdom, and this stands with infallible
reason; but leaving this Argument as that which already is in the way of
decifion by the sword, which when we have all said what can be alleged, is the
best title of all Kings and Commonwealths, and the same on which all or most
of the Kings in the world have founded their powers and Soveraignties; What a
strange passion then and madness possesses his surviving party, which during
the life time and height of their masters power could not with all their united
forces, their many plots and continued practices prevail against the
Parliament, or enable him to attain to any piece of his ends, whose boundless
ambition, lead him (as we may safely believe) to fight as well against Heaven
as his own Subjects, and saw it not, or would not, but pursued his designs so
long as any power or hopes prompted him to believe, that happily in the end he
might be the Conqueror, but but missing of all his aims, and himself in
another world, that there should still remain so many of his defeated
partisans, which out of an old and inbred malice have found out a way (as they
vainly conceive) how to be revenged on their Conquerors, (is the wonder of the
times) by presenting his Book, with his picture praying in the Frontispiece,
purposely to catch and amuse the people, magnifying all his misdeeds for pious
actions, canonizing him for a Saint, and idolizing his memory for an innocent
Martyr, an imposture without other parallel than that of Mahomet;
considerations which for the general satisfaction, and for the better
discovery of the truth of all affairs between the King and Parliament, have
principally induced me to take (in brief) the true dimensions of this Sainted
King and innocent Martyr, and to pull off that false vizzard wherewith his
juggling party has decked his Effigies, and presented him to the public view,
for the most pious Prince of this age, that so the people may behold him in his
native complexon; true it is some other important reasons have moved me to
undertake this task, as having seen the many poor, easy, and believing people
of this Nation, too long mislead, and cosened out of their understanding by his
usual protestations, which God willing shall be made evidently clear by the
Kings own hand writing, and by the self same artifices wherewith he had so
often deluded and prevailed on the belief of too many of his own party
pretending to knowledge above the ordinary rank of the vulgar, other reasons
have moved me hereunto, as for satisfaction of some obstinate Royalists to whom
I have wished well, and with whom I have had several disputes on such
particular subjects, as may be seen in the subsequent reply; ranckt between
the breviary of the Kings reign, and the observations on several of his own
Letters and Expresses; and lastly to confute a new sprung up scandal most
ungratefully and maliciously raised against the Parliament; viz. That the
present change of the Government both Civil and Ecclesiastical, the cutting
off the King and his Posterity, were Plots and Contrivances of a longer date
and standing than this Parliament, though pursued and accomplished by a party
yet sitting at Westminster: this being the scope and method of the whole, I
have thought it not impertinent in preparation thereunto here to adjoyn some
thing of the place of his birth, and manner of his breeding; That he was born
in Scotland, 1600. and remained there until the second year of his Fathers
reign, needs no further attestation; That on the ceasing of the sickness
1602. at London (for its ominously remarkable, that two most furious plagues
immediately followed the very ingresse both of the Father and the Son to their
Crowns) under the style and title of Duke of York, he was conveyed from
Edenborough to St. James's known to many yet living; That during his Infancy,
then fitter for the oversight of the female sex, than the masculine, there was
such an innated, incorrigible, obduracy, and inflexibility in his nature, that
his Nurses and those Gentlewomen that attended him could very rarely devise how
to please him, much less to reclaim that intemperature of his natural
constitution; which as the Gentlewomen themselves have both often related and
protested, so are there yet enough alive which will justify it as a known
truth, and of which his mother Queen Anne would often complain, usually calling
him her perverse and obstinate Son, and his Brother Prince HENRY, not without a
prophetical judgment to befall the Kingdom, in case on King James his Father
and his own decease the Crown should descend on him; God knows and I call him
to witness that I shall not willingly present a syllable to the prejudice of
his memory, otherwise then for truths sake (abused) and the general
satisfaction of such as would be rightly informed thereof, having never had any
cause given me to write more or less than becomes me in sincerity, confessing
that considering the distance I stood in to be a pertaker of his secrets, as
having been only a poor servant of his Fathers, until weary of the Court I
retired, having seen enough of the vanity thereof, and of both raigns, though
on some urgent occasions, in my Addresses to him, I have had the honor of his
gracious aspect; and sometimes good words from his own mouth, never any other
injury, than in my particular sufferings, involved in the general calamity
proceeding from the late fatal war, of which I cannot in justice excuse him
whose ambition and wilfulness to rule alone, and without control of any
others than hers, which had too long and imperiously overruled him, which the
following Animadversions will more amply manifest; Having thus made my Apology,
that neither any particular spleen or quarrel to his person has incensed me
to write, as in justice I ought; I come to his education as he arrived to riper
years, under the tutorship of Bishops, and men of that Garb (known to many who
they were) how he was seasoned both in Learning and Religion: Its most certain
that he attained to some competent measure of literature (for a Prince) and as
I have some reason to believe sucked in with the most of the Episcopal leven,
but as to the Religion wherewith afterward he was seasoned, I am confident he
was more beholding to his honest Secretary Mr. Murrey, than to any other of his
Prelaticall Tutors, though he after proved (at best) a mere formal Protestant;
an enemy to the Puritan party, and a friend to Bishops, as proceeding from the
instructions of his own Father, and the influence of his Prelaticall tetinue;
Its a known truth, that in the midst of that long, fruitless, and restless
pursuit of the old Kings for a marriage with the Infanta, Secretary Murrey who
had then the chiefest influence on his Counsels, had privately diswaded him
from any further thought thereof, as a Match which would neither be well
pleasing to God, acceptable to the generality of the people, or propitious to
the Kingdom, in respect of the disparity of their religions, which so much
wrought upon him, what by the Secretaries own persuasions, and the reading
unto him of Mr. De Molins Tractate on the 17 of Deutronomy, De Illegitimes
Marages, that he was altogether averted to marry in any papisticall family;
insomuch as the old King making diligent inquiry by whose infusions he was so
much alienated from the Spanish Match, it was at last found out to be Mr.
Murreys workmanship, which cost the honest man the loss of his place, and
expulsion the Court: Howsoever the King out of his restless desire to match
his Son in the House of Austria soon turned his affection, and sends him in
person attended with the Duke of Buckingham, privately by the way of France, to
Madrid; where after an expencefull voyage, and to no other purpose but to his
own dishonor, and disgrace to the Prince (after six months stay in Spain) he
returned to London, the 5 of October following his going from hence, and about
5 months after his arrival the old King dyed at Theobalds, and the Crown
descended upon him, which anon we shall see how he managed it: That he had then
so much applause and love of the people in general, even to a kind of
veneration, in the hopes that all men conceived of his future Government is
known to thousands yet living, and that no Prince sooner lost it, is also not
unknown, most men wondering how so suddenly not only the affections of the
people were withdrawn from him, but to fall into the general obloquy, was held
by the wisest a kind of Riddle, not suspecting and indeed then not knowing, or
not observing the reasons thereof to have arisen from his then present steerage
of the Helm, by the only Compass of the old Kings delineation, whereof more
hereafter will appear in his carriage at his first Oxford Parliament; where I
must give this caution to the Reader, not to value that late impartial and
flattering Author, Aulicus Coquinariae, neither to give over much credit to
King James his Court, who in some particulars speaks much more of truth than
the other babbler, who with no color at all of sincerity and knowledge of those
times talks at random, palpably and ridiculously rendering King James for the
only Platonicall, Politic, Peaceable and pious King of his time, a Prince as
he would have it believed, the Paragon for his wisdom and care, the fruits
whereof no rational man could ever yet discern, when the plain truth was, and
the right measure of his peaceable reign was well known to all Europe, to be
the only occasion of all the after Wars throughout Germany, and the root of
all those of his Successors throughout his Dominions, those in Germany, to the
utter undoing of his Son-in-Law the Count Palatyne, and all those Princes which
assisted him in the Cause of Bohemia, whilst himself refused, or durst not draw
his Sword, through mere fear of offending the SPANIARD in the least punctilio,
but sat musing at home how to improve his Sovereignty, to devise projects how
to raise moneys to satiate his needy and greedy Scotch Courtiers, by privy
seals, benevolences, sale of Forest lands, asserts, woods, and Crown Lands,
and to pick quarrels with his Parliaments, and to entaile them to his heirs
General; his successor proving no ill scholar in putting in practice his
Fathers precepts, and for the better invading of the libertyes of the Subjects,
to suppress Parliaments, which never offended him, but in refusing to supply
his prodigalities, when himself had wasted treble the treasure in an idle
Peace, than his predecessor the Queen spent in a continued and furious War,
with the greatest Prince of Christendom, and yet to leave him the richest King
of the Western World, which if the plain truth of the affairs of those times
may without offense be made manifest, were the only fruits of his so much
magnified and peaceable reign, for I may in sincerity say it over and over
again, and no other than a known truth, that the not drawing of his Sword, in
the Count Palatines quarrel, to which he was so often importuned, by most of
the German Princes, invited, yea pressed by his own Council of State, yet
would he not, but hindered in what possibly he could, those that would and did,
to their utter undoing by his many expencefull, and fruitless Embasseys, and
to the greatning of the Austrian Family, which had long befoold and baffled
him even to the derision and scorn of all the Princes of Europe; as to his
Justice of which the Court Cook tattels, the whole Kingdom can witness, how he
measured it out, by suffering the rigor and uttermost penalty of the Law, to
fall on the accessaries in Sir Tho. Overbuties case, and to take the
Principalls into his mercy, it is true (not Somerset into his former favor) yet
sure we are to stop his mouth from telling of tales, he gave him at once in
pure gift so much of the Crown Lands, as were well worth to be sold 100000
pounds, though it melted away like wax in the Sun, and himself to dye a stark
beggar, and in infamy, and as to that his most excellent chaste Lady, and Virgin
Bride, let the ghosts of Sir James Stuart, Sir George Wharton, and Prince Henry
speak, and not him, this is most manifest, that by divine justice, she was
known to dye living, and of so loathsome a disease, that her own Gentlewomen,
have often protested it before many credible witnesses, they could not endure
the Chamber where she lay, neither scarce the next adjacent for the horrible
stink that a long time before she expired, issued from her carcass, and
polluted the air; I could speak much more of the carriage of that foul
business, and of others, not pertinent to this place, and so can many more
persons of honor yet alive, which will tell the tatler to his face that which
he has either with impudence or out of ignorance published; are both false and
abominable adulatious, both in reference to the old King, Somerset, and his
Lady, and others of that tribe, Sir Walter Rawly, the Archbishop Abbot, and
that of the records, on which he would build the fabric of his untruths, were
known forgeryes of their own making; and as to the Archbishops particular, he
comes not near the truth, that honest man alone, as it is well known,
withstood the King alone and the other Bishops, in their base compliance in
that nullity; insomuch that the King took upon him to convince the said
Archbishop in a treatise, dedicated to the unbelieving Thomas, yet to be seen,
passages, which as it seems, the talking tatler knew not, neither little of
truth, which he assumes to relate, and howsoever he has farc't up a Pamphlet,
as to the matter (happily his own or not) yet in good manners he might have
forborne, to make use of another man's phrase, which in diverse places of his
relation it appears he has stolen out of the Fragmenta Regalia, though varied
to the worse, and by him as much vitiated, as by the printer. But I now both
leave him and his theaft, until I may have the happiness to hear further from
him, then doubtless I shall not fail to give him a fuller answer; in the mean
time I shall advise him to remember, that he which justifies the wicked, and
condemns the just, even they both are an abomination to the Lord, a text that
will become both of us, to take into our serious consideration, and as I have
good reason to believe, best of the two befits himself to look to, who takes
upon him with such palpable flattery to present King James for such a
Saint-like Prince, when as had he either known a piece of his life and
conversation, or the least of his secrets and Counsels (as of those I well know
him not to be guilty) surely he would have been ashamed so to have written of a
King, who left behind so little evidence of piety, true Religion, temperance,
and care of the Subjects welfare, and so much of the structure of absolute
Monarchy to his successor, a study to which he had wholly devoted himself, and
left it to his Son as an infelicious legacy, and three Kingdoms destruction,
which were without all question, the fruits and effects of his pe ceable
reign. But briefly now to his only Son, and the heir of his fathers unhappy
peace, and the prosecutor of his own, his posterities, and the Kingdoms ruin.

THE REIGN OF KING CHARLES, Or the pseudo-Martyr discovered, etc.
KING CHARLES, then Prince of Wales, began his unfortunate Reign on the
expiration of his Father King James at Theobalds the 27 of March 1627. At his
very first entry to the Crown, and after the consummation of the ceremonies of
his Inauguration, and the reception of the Queen from France, he was (as his
Father before him at hi accession) driven away from the Metropolis of the
Kingdom (London) by the increase and rage of the Pestilence, as an ill omen
both to the Father and the Son, but of a more ominous portent to the three
Kingdoms.

A Parliament at that time was summoned, and sitting at Westminster, but
hastily adjourned to Oxford, on the former reason of the increase of the
Sickness, and a War likewise was then in preparation, and in design for Spayn,
as an ill presage of the after improsperity in all others which this
unfortunate Prince undertook; for what in this kind was ever enterprised by
him, was both inauspicious and fatal, loss of Honor to himself, reputation
and destruction to the English Nation.

During the Parliament at Oxford, the King by his Speaker, the Lord Keeper
Williams, moved the Assembly for a present supply of moneys in relation to the
intended War, the Parliament in reply to the Kings desires, as they were to be
Contributors to the War, so they humbly moved to be made partakers of the
design; this so reasonable a motion was very ill taken, yea scorned by the
King, for it even then evidently appeared, that he meant to rule alone, and at
will and pleasure. Hence we may observe the first distaste, or rather indeed a
picked quarrel against his first Parliament, which shows out unto us, on how
small, or no cause at all, he would be quarrelsome with his Great Councels, and
what he would be to all other Parliaments. And the more to show the regret he
took at this motion, he commands Glanvile a Lawyer, a Gentleman of choice
education and elocution, then a Member of that House, to attend the Fleet at
Plymouth, (as he then said, to let him understand what he so much desired to
know, as to the design) and upon this miffe abruptly breaks up the Assembly
without their assistance, which on all honorable and fitting terms was not
denied him.

The Crown at this time was exceedingly indigent, and indeed so beggarly and
indebted, that the Royal Revenues suffised not to defray the Court expenses;
yet so high and haughty was the Kings heart, that rather than to be beholding
to the Parliament, he was resolved to run any hazard that might befall him, and
in the midst of this extreme necessity, sends Sir Sackvil Crow with the Crown
jewels (a Gentleman of high esteem with the Duke of Buckingham) to pawn them in
the Low Countries.

Wise men might then well believe, that the King could not possibly be so
wanting to himself, or so poor in treasure, as to be put on so dishonorable a
straight, when as with a good word or two in compliance with the Parliament, he
might have had before what in reason he would have desired, and that at that
instant the major part of the Queens Dowry was received; but the truth was, it
was as soon spent as taken, in the gayety of the English Lords, attendants then
on the new Queen at Paris; where especially the Duke, amongst others, out vyed
all the French Lords in the sumptuousness of his expenses, and bravery of his
apparel; so that how rich soever the Queen and her attendants were then in
their Wardrobes, sure it is, they came home poor enough in purse to the English
Court.

The Queens French attendants and dependants of both sexes being numerous, were
doubtless far too many to be maintained with any ordinary expense: She was
then not only (in comparison) a mere child, but childish in her carriage, and A
la Francoise, petulant in her comportment; the King was then no more but her
Tutor, she his Pupil, what after they both were in relation to each other, and
how those offices were inverted, time and a little patience will show, but most
certain it is, that Madam Nurse (like an other Philippina the Cajetan to Joan
Queen of Naples) was both her Oracle and Governess, her only attendants, (or
better may it be said) her many nasty French appurtenances were more in number
than ever were known to follow such an Emperors Governesse (for so she then
was to the Queen) and such vermin they were as that the English Ladies (but in
respect to the Queen) held them to be little better then as Scullions for the
Kitchen; yet were these the Locusts which then and a long time after devoured
all in the English Court, which was at that time with much ado prodigally
maintained at Salisbury, whilst the King and the Lords of his Council were all
to seek how to defray his own expenses, and the wantonness of a Court,
promiscuously pestered, both with domestic, foreign, idle, and useless numbers
of both sexes.

I was then in that Progress, and usually in the Court, and a sad witness
into what streights the King was reduced, and were it not within the
remembrance of many yet alive, the relation might seem strange, what in so new
and green a Reign was both attempted, and with boldness put in execution:
The prodigality of the Court then so much out-went the Royal Revenues, that the
Kings Officers and Purveyors had not wherewithal to defray the expense of the
King and Queens Tables. The King, to begin the first President of his arbitrary
Governmen, sends for the Farmers of the Customs, and gains what possibly he
could from them, which by reason of the sickness, and damp of Trade at London,
would then have put back their contract upon him, however money he had, and
would have it of them; but that served not the turn, some other course must be
taken for present supply of the Kings wants; Sir James Ley then newly made Earl
of Marlborow was then Lord Treasurer, Weston and Cottington, (all new men and
of very small beginings) were the men shortly after under the Duke, which
principally then and after managed the Kings Treasury, and were those which he
had chosen and picked out as fit Ministers to be employed in his after
arbitrary designs, yet I am confident none of them all durst advise him for
any thing which they found not suitable to his inclination. The Kings next
project then was, how he might raise present moneys (for from London he could
not expect farther supplies, the Merchants and the a blessed Citizens being fled
the City, by reason of the rage of the Pestilence) whereupon he resolved to
take it where he could find it, the City of Salisbury a place of small circuit,
and of less trade, was first pressed with a loan of 1000 l. the City of Bristol
(as I remember) with 3000 l. which was (by some Aldermen of that City sent to
the Court in excuse of their then present disabilityes) denied, but that served
not their turns, for they were presently laid by the heels, until the said sum
was sent unto him; this President being a caveat sufficient to all other of the
Western Cities and Towns to send in what sums were skonced on them; neither
would this serve the Kings indigency, but he borrowed of all the principal
Gentlemen of the West, which were known or conceived to be monyed men: it is
most evident that even then, and at his first access to the Crown he stood
not on terms of love or hatred of his people; for what he intended, it appeared
plainly he would do, and what he acted he held it sufficiently legal, as a
piece of his birthright, and of right belonging to him as a King, without
looking into the nature of the English Sovereignty, his will was the law he
intended to rule by; as to Parliaments, his meaning as it appears was the same
with Jews the eleventh of France, and in imitation of him to take them down
together with their power, as he had opportunity; notwithstanding some few he
called, more for the supply of his present necessity, than the good he intended
to the public, and in the future as time should enable him to be his own
carver of his Subjects estates and fortunes, as that shortly after followed.

We have thus laid down in sincerity the beginnings of this unhappy Reign. Now
this pestilentiall Summer being well spent, upon the approach of the Winter,
and decrease of the Sickness, the King, and the young Queen, with all her
French train, draws nearer to the City of London, and being still in his
wonted predicament of want, in supply of the Court expenses, be pursues the
game he was resolved to play, for raising of Treasure (without consent of
Parliament) by arbitrary projects, whereof amongst many which followed, he
begins with that of Knighthood, and calls to account (under color of an old
obsolete Law) all such Gentlemen and others, within the limitation of that
Statute, as attended not his Coronation, though by his own Proclamation, he had
before forbidden their attendance.

Shortly after comes in to his service Sir Thomas Wentworth, who to show what
he would be, and how serviceable to the Kings designs he might be, was
employed into the North, where he rigorously levied a very considerable sum
on the Gentlemen and Yeomen of those parts: Weston (another of these Arbitrary
beagles) as an overseer to the Earl of Pembroke, and other Commissioners, was
employed into the West; the treasure which was by this lawless project raised
being come together, was a very vast sum, but it was as soon issued as levied,
and served not to defray the moity of the Court expenses; insomuch as being
still necessitated, very shortly thereupon another Parliament was thought fit
to be summoned, this was no sooner assembled, but the House of Commons on the
tenth of May, 1626. Charged the Duke of Buckingham with the late Kings death,
and sent up their Charge to the Lords; the King being well acquainted
therewith, comes into the Peers House, and tells them, that he could be a
witness to clear the Duke in evry particular of that charge, and thereupon in
terror to the lower House, by his Warrant under his hand, attacheth and
sends to prison Sir Dudly Diggs, and Sir John Elliot, as those which had the
managery of that affair, notwithstanding the House of Commons having the
proofs and examinations in preparation against the Duke, the King to make all
sure, and in arrest of farther proceedings against his chief privado, the 15 of
June following in a great rage dissolves that Parliament, and on dis-robing
himself, said in a very stern comportment, That it should be the last time he
would ever put them on.

And here we may take into observation, the lamentable effects of that innated
duritie, that natural obstinacy and perverseness of the violent will of this
most unhappy Prince, who in affront and despite of the Justice of a Court of
Parliament, would not suffer his own Fathers death to be called to account, or
any further examination thereof to be taken for clearing the Duke; But Gods
Judgments may not be arested, and it is he, that mauger the teeths of all
humane powers, will in his own good time bring to light, and to Judgment, that
crying sin of Blood; and have we not seen this verified, to our amazement?
the Duke shortly thereupon to have dyed, by the stab of a knife, with no other
words or prayers in his mouth, than Gods wounds I am slain; and this most
unhappy Prince to have ended his days at his own Gates, by the axe of Gods
just judgment, and as we may say in fear and trembling, to have taken his leave
and last farewell of this world with no other acknowledgment of his faults, and
of those crying sins of bloodshed throughout the three Kingdoms, but that of
a Pharasaicall justifying of himself and his innocence, insisting to his last,
without any repentance or sensibilitie of so much innocent blood spilt through
his only willfulness, but only of one wicked The Earl of STRAFFORD.
man's, having throughout the whole course of the late and lamentable contest
between him and the Parliament, evermore covered over that stubbornness of his
natural inclination with those false colors and delusive umbrages, of his
Conscience, Constancy, and Reason, as if his Conscience, by divine appointment,
had been the Master Conscience of all the Kingdom, and his Reason that ipse
dixit, that must overballance and regulate the sense and Judgment of a Court of
Parliament.

And have we not seen those bold and principal instruments of his, whom he
employed in all his arbitrary projects, the Earl of Strafford, and the
Archbishop of Canterbury, for the enslaving of the three Kingdoms, condemned to
the block, as misleaders of their incorrigible Master, and to have taken their
leaves of the world in the same pharasaicall way of justifying their innocence,
and without so much as one word of the repentant Publican, God be merciful to
me a sinner? and yet all of them, by the seduced Malignant party held still in
a kind of veneration, and I know not by what strange delusion, reputed for
innocents and martyrs; would they but look upon them as they were the actors
and known fomenters of all the miseries we have suffered, yea the only ingines
and instruments whereby to have wound up sovereignty to the highest pitch of
Tyranny, and to make their Master instead of a King over Gentlemen and Freemen,
a Tyrant over slaves.

But having brought the King and his young Queen near to the metropolis of the
Kingdom, and the sickness decreasing, I shall in a short narration describe
the after deportmeut of this most unfortunate prince; Instead of Prayers and
humiliations to God for his great mercy, in the miraculous stay of that raging
pestilence, whereby 3. 4. and 5000 weekly died that summer only in London, the
Court notwithstanding was instantly in Iolity, Masks, Dancings, Plays, and
Banquets (all in expencefull and sumptuous ostentations) were the frequent and
assiduall exercises of the Court; on the one side (as to devotion) the Queen
had her Mass, and Mass Priests, on the other side the King with his Laodicean
lukewarm and fawning Prelates, in a mere formality in show of Godliness, God
knows without the power thereof, and in as near a compliance one to the other,
as possibly their different devotion could permit.

And here I must not omit, neither exempt out of the scene that part which the
Bishops and Prelates acted in this interlude, Comicall we may call it, as to
the beginning thereof, but God knows tragical enough in the close.

The Bishops which in the former reign had for diverse reasons of State been
admitted to the old Kings privacies, and had special Influence on his
Counsels, were likewise transmitted to the favor and indulgency of this King,
but more especially in reference to the Presbytery of Scotland so averse to
absolute Sovereignty, so much affected by either King, (A Generation of Vipers
which on any terms would have eaten the way to preferment through the entrayls
of either Church or State) these were the men (the better to ingratiate
themselves into the Kings favor) that spared not to insinuat how dangerous the
Puritan party here in England was (as of a fraternity with the Presbyterians of
Scotland) and would be (if not timely looked unto) to the advance of
Sovereignty: apprehensions, which as they soon took fire with the father, so as
much if not more with the son; hence it was that the most active of them were
admitted either to his favor or Council of State, but especially Doctor Laud
the Bishop of London, after Archbishop of Canterbury, a person of a very
subtle and winding spirit, proud (as one raised out of the dust) haughty and
imperious in his place, and as fit an instrument for the Kings turn as
possibly he could chose out of the 26. Prelates.

There was also about this time (as before is intimated) taken into the Kings
favor, or rather brought in by the alurement of preferment, Sir Thomas
Wentworth, whom the King immediately created a Baron, and (on the decease of
Weston the Treasurer) Earl of Strafford, a Gentleman of great parts and
patrimony; a Common-wealths-man he had been, and one that formerly in all
Parliaments as much thwarted, and withstood the arbitrary power of both Kings,
as any one whatsoever; the King having won this Gentleman to be his own,
bethought himself that these two (with some others of the same stamp) would be
sufficient to whom to impart his grand designs, the one for Church affairs, the
other for the State, but both suitable to the ends he had in hand; the last
being of as high, bold, and haughty a spirit as he could possibly have picked
out of all the nobility: Time will show us, and our own lamentable experience
may better demonstrate, how the one in Church affairs, the other in civil
administrations, behaved themselves, to the after prejudice and destruction of
the three Kingdoms; But as we have already said in the end to their own ruin
and their Masters.

To leave this digression, we have left the King and Queen at the Court, let us
return where we left them in their different devotions; the truth was, how
little care soever there was then taken either by the King or his time-serving
Prelates, of Gods service and true worship, otherwise than in a formality or
show of Godliness, either in the Court or throughout the Kingdom; sure we are,
that the Queens superstitious worship was specially provided for, and a sort
of Locusts there were (in addition to her own Chaplins) admitted the Kingdom,
styled by the name of Capuchins (but cunning knaves) and for these a new
Chapel was erected, with an habitation, and large maintenance allowed them,
even in the face of the Court, and eye of the Kingdom; and to please the Queen,
Masses and Mass Priests were frequently permitted throughout the Land, not
only in a tacit connivence, but in an open way of tolleration, and in contempt
of Gods true worship.

We may well admit, that the ways which the King then took could not be
welpleasing to him, which was never yet pleased with an Idolatrous, mixed, and
halfe-fac'd worship; or that the gayety and wantonness of a promiscuous Court,
could be maintained without an excessive charge; neither that a perfidious show
and offer of a war with France in the defense of the French Protestants,
would in the conclusion be well thought of either from abroad or at home, when
the King during the treaty of the marriage with the Queen, on the earnest
request of the princes of the Religion, had engaged himself to protect them,
and to raise the siedge then before the Town of R^chell, neither that feigned
preparation which the King made by sea in their assistance will in time come to
light, when evident it was afterward to all the World, that in stead of
defending them, they were not only slaughtered at Sea by the Kings shipping,
but by plain Treachery both their Cause undone, and their forces defeated by
Land; a sin, which God in his justice could not pass over unpunished, yet
carried on in such a mystical way; and in that attempt on the Isle of Rea, to
the loss of honor and blood of some of the bravest men of the Nation;
insomuch that the World to this very day has been held in suspense, to what
Religion the King himself stood most inclyned or whether the Father or the Son,
which with such ardency sought the Alliance of Spain and France, (or else no
where) Families, if not incestous, yet of Idolatrous and Supersticious
Religions, which has left the world in another amaze, and in a puzzle to find
out others inclination, or whether to any Religion devoted, if it be rightly
considered, as either Prince made and continued their secret addresses to the
Apostolic see, and that his Holiness in both reigns had his Agents and
Nuntioes here resident (reciprocally and in interchange of the Kings Agents at
Rome) many clandestine conferences both with the King and Queen, and the state
of the Protestant Religion here, (howsoever openly professed by both Kings)
reduced to the next step of conformity with Rome; when as that sordid and base
compliance of the Bishops and Court-Clergy, which if grace (more than hopes of
preferment) had prevailed with them might have been a Remora or stay to either
King, and to have told them plainly how dangerous it was to their well-being,
if they attempted to make Religion the stalking-horse to their irregular
designs, and to bethink themselves that God was not to be deluded, and how
unsafe it would be for them Ludere cum sanctis; But these were the men who even
from the beginning of both reigns, had only studied the inclinations of these
Princes, and rather took upon them to comply and encourage them than to have
withstood either of them in the least of their many irregularities, and
looseness in Religion; and such was the baseness of these fawning Sycophants,
that the common theams of the Court Pulpits, throughout both reigns, were
purposely picked out where on to draw conclusions and doctrines of arbitrary
power, which was the usual ladder most of them clim'd to preferment; whence
also we may observe Gods judgments, both to have been shortly after powered out
on the persons themselves and their functions, in their extirpation, and total
irradication of them, without hopes of their restoration.

Hitherto we have deduced the History of this unfortunate Prince to the 3d.
year of his Reign; we shall now run over the rest with as much brevity as the
nature of the subject will permit.

The King at this time was in his wonted condition of want, as his Father
before him ever was, so would he be in the same predicament: Two millions of
annual Treasure or very near, could not serve their turns, neither would it
content them, though in Scotl. 50000 l. per annum was more than ever King James
could possibly raise, without the assistance of the Estates assembled. We may
see the difference, and what oprations change of Clymates can work upon the
nature of Princes coming out of poor Kingdoms into richer, and with what
Conscience they could dispense the care of their own souls, to become as
spunges to suck up the fruits of the poor passive people of England, gained out
of the labor of their hands and sweat of their brows, when they had enough,
and more than ever any of the Kings of England did raise, and in retribution of
their love and loyalty toward them, as by diverse manifestations may be made
appear, with how many slights and wyles, with how much care, trouble and
vexation of spirit, with what expense of blood and treasure did this King labor
to inslave the English Nation, and to reduce the poor people (as naturalized
vassalls) under the bondage of his lawless will and lust? Can we make any
other Comment on this subject, but that which wise men have long since
observed, that these two Princes never loved the English Nation, but in an
odium altissimum, had aforehand designed to oppress them, and utte rly to
extinguish the memory of their ancient Freedoms? and can we imagine they
intended otherwise, by the whole course of their Government? When it appears
what favors, what large concessions, and with what compliance and
commiseration the late King took care of the Irish Rebels, without the least
retrospect how much English blood had been most barbarously spilt by them (if
he were not conscious that no man was more guilty thereof than himself) surely
it may well amuse the world, why he should be so pitiful and solicitous to
have them spared, and to brand the Parliament with cruelty for pursuing so just
a revenge. If we look Northward, and examine what Favors, Privileges, and
Countyes were without asking offered to be conferred on the Scots, 1641. as he
went unto them, on the only conditions, that they would engage with him
against the English Parliament. On these considerations, can it sink into any
rational man's conception, but that he was an inexorable enemy to the Nation?
kind to his own (if they would have served his turn) and an indeered Friend to
those bloody Irish, and that on all opportunities his intent was to ruin and
invassalate the English Nation, though he and his perished, (as they did) in
the attempt.

But to return to our relation. The King was now in the 15 year of his Reign,
and notwithstanding the many ways by which he had raised no small treasure,
yet was he still indigent and bare in money, the Court and the French spent it
before it came in, and as to any supply by Parliament, it suited neither to the
Kings good liking, or his grand design; the discontinuance of Parliaments
conduced more to the advance of what he intended to raise by power, than he
could expect by the aid of Parliament, since he had but even then closed up
all ruptures with France and Spuin; and no War in being or in expectation, and
consequently no ground left him that might press or induce a Court of
Parliament to be over-liberall with the purses of their Electors; yet in this
exigent and straight he suddenly resolves to call a Parliament, where amongst
many passages and debates, Finch the Speaker of the lower house, played his
first prise, in his assiduall disclosing to the King what soever past in the
House; insomuch as being discovered, and on his usual moving out of his Chair
and the House, he was at length withstood at the door by diverse bold Gentlemen
and Members of the Parliament, and enforced to keep his seat; this miscarriage
was instantly made known to the King, who took it as an affront done to his own
person, and presently hereupon he not only dissolves the Parliament, but
commits to the Tower, Hammond and Hubbard, Knights, Long, Curreton, and some
others of the Members: Neither could he be a long time pacified by the Lords of
his Council (on the first hearing of this broil) but needs he would with his
guard have then fallen upon them in the house (as a presage of that violence
which he offered after to this Assembly in his own person;) upon the instant
of this dissolution of the Parliament, he publishes a Proclamation,
prohibiting the people not so much as to talk of more Parliaments, and enjoined
the Lords of his Council, on any conditions not to mention the word Parliament
unto him; a lesson which they all for ten years together at least punctually
observed; insomuch as all wise men then conjectured, that the Liberties of the
Kingdom were then buried together in the interment of all Parliaments. Ten if
not more years past between this Parliament, and the dissolution of that quinto
Maij, 1639. during this intervall; the King begins roundly with all sorts of
pro^ects, and to raise money both without the leaves of the Subjects, and
against the known Laws of the Kingdom; privy Seals and Loans were the first
which he put in execution, as a Tax (if we may so call them) that concerned not
so much the Subject in general, as private, reputed moneyed men; other levies
had likewise their course in their torns; and in policy not to rush in, and too
hastily on the subjects propriety, he falls on the sale of the Crown lands in
Pe^farm, with the old rents, or those doubled, reserved to the Exchequer;
neither could all these projects, though amounting to a very vast sum, serve to
defray the wastefullnesse of the Court, which indeed as to his own side, was in
some proportion of moderation, yet on the Queens side it was so excessively
profuse, that I aver it on knowledge (besides her Jointure) (then newly
consigned) one hundred thousand pound Per Annum sufficed not for to defray her
own expenses, and confident I am, what by sales procured by her solicitations,
as much more was yearly drayned out of the Kings purse to satisfy that nasty
trayn of her French followers; Madam Nurse, as to her own particular, besides
an expencefull way of living here, at the Kings charge, was well known to have
transported at several times into France 100000 pound, in good gold; and
certain it is, that that Pigmy Mountebanck (Mountague) the Queens dancing
Master, not worth one groat at his coming over, inricht himself to the least
value of 40000 pound; it would be wearisome to recount what sums her Priests
and Jesuits, Musicians, Fiddlers, and others of her retinue got and amassed by
her only suit to the King, who then denied her nothing that she desired; for
it is most true, that before she attained the age of twenty years, she began of
a Pupil to be the Kings Regent, and the afterstory will assure it, she became
a fatal participant with him in most of his Counsels, and his directrix in
the Government, but after her Mothers arivall both of them to have gained an
interest in his inmost secrets and principal transactions of State; an evident
truth, and more than stood with the Kings honor, much less than suited with
the welfare of the Nation.

These prodigal expenses at Court could not choose but impoverish the Kings
exchequer, whether very little of the Royal Revenue arrived, as commonly
prevented aforehand by assignations to one or other of the Courtiers, hence
followed the multiplicity of Monopolies, the engrossing of all the Powder into
the Kings store, and that to be no otherwise vendible but at double rates, to
the former and usual prises; In order to these followed the preemption of all
Tobacoes, to the extreme beggering of the adventurers and planters in the
West-Indian Islands; Coat and Conduct money had likewise it is turn, and by
degrees the Kings Pattents incircuited and extended to Salt, Butter, Soap,
Leather, Wine, Sugar, Alum, Sea-coale, Malt, Cards and Dice, and what not.

In order to these, that notable project of shipmoney, a device of Finches
invention, and shaped for the nonce suitable to the Kings designs, it extenden
to such a latitude, as that by this one illegal power he might raise moneys in
what proportion he would, where and when he pleased, without Parliaments, and
so was it stated by the terror which that fluttering bird Finch impressed on the
Judges to declare it legal, by their extrajudiciall sentences, though (for
their honor be it spoken) three of them as Crook, Hutton, and Denham withstood
it as a most illegal and unheard of taxation against and destructive to the
fundamental Laws of the Land, and Liberties of the People.

We shall now pass it over, though it was an invention which of it self would
require a story not unworthy to be left to posterity; how ever, as long as it
was on foot the King made use of it to the purpose, and in two if not three
years whilst it was put in practice, raised not so little at 1000000 of
pounds.

It is without question that what by monopolies, the inhancing of the Customs
and Rate Books, Knighthood money, and projects of this nature, as the Fines in
the Star Chamber, High Commission, and depopulations, with the sale of the
Crown Lands, besides Subsidies, and the Royal standing Revenue, with diverse
other incomes most oppressive to the people, the King within the space of ten
or twelve years raised more Treasure than any two of his Predecessors in forty
years, and yet none of our Kings had less occasion, and this King more
wanting, as having for twelve years together no wars considerable, neither
any in expectation, more than such as wilfully and most unjustly he undertook
about the 15th. year of his reign against the Scots, and that to no other end,
but to advance his grand design of invassalating the 3. Kingdoms, as
hereafter more evidently may be made to appear.

The King having thus far waded into the depth of his arbitrary strains, to the
great regret of the people, and having for ten or twelve years together laid
aside all thoughts of making use of Parliament, which might control so many
of his illegal and irregular exactions, in farther advance of his grand
design, both to rule, and raise money at will and pleasure having by so long a
tract of time taught the people to forget Parliaments, or not to hope for them,
and as he conceived, well to have forwarded his greater work by the experience
he had made of the passivenesse both of his English and Irish Subjects, by the
activity of his chief Instruments, Strafford, Canterbury, and Cottington, which
principally then carried on the design in either Kingdom, both in the Church
and State, which by time and degrees had so amated the spirits of the people,
as they seemed patiently to bear (though unwillingly, and not without some
public murmuration) what loads might in the future be laid upon them, but
evermore (in the midst of their resentments) to cast the odium of their
oppressions rather on the Kings ministers than on himself, with the retention
of a reverent esteem toward him, as the least author of their sufferings, when
as himself alone was principal, which invited him with the more boldness, and
less fear, to the perfecting and speedy accomplishment of his mayn design.

We may in the way of our relation avouch it, and that for truth, that both the
Father and the Son were the most careless Courtiers of their people of any
of our Kings, and as regardlesse of the love and reverent esteem the universal
Nation carried toward them; an inexcusable error, and shows out unto us what
in probability were and would be the issues of their Ingratitude. We all know,
that popularity in private persons, and the applause of the people, are the
ingredients of suspicion, and an error which al wise and cunning Statists shun
and avoid, as tending to obscure the worth and dignity of their Master, but in
Princes it is a Virtue, that most of all other their deportments takes most and
soonest in the peoples affections; we may boldly say it, that neither of these
two Princes were ever guilty of that attractive Virtue, only it has been
since observed, that at his coming out of Scotl. 1641. he was very prodigal
in putting off his hat, as he past the streets.

But omitting Paraphrases, we have but even now said it, that as to the Queens
side in Court it was excessively profuse, the Kings more moderate; yet not so
frugall, but that there were a sort about his person to whom he participated
his secrets, and committed the managery of his arbitrary work, which did
sufficiently lick their fingers: We shall omit the Duke, for he died within two
years of the Kings access, Digby and Cottington, which in the former reign had
laid the foundations of their after greatness; but they which in this reign,
(and in the midst of the Kings necessities) spent lavishly, lived at high
rates, and amassed most, were Weston the Treasurer, Manchester, Strafford,
Goring, and the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, neither did the farmers of the
Customs go away empty handed, yet we may see, that as all or most of these had
a time of getting and filching from the Crown, so likewise did their Master in
the end administer a sad occasion to rid most of them of their ill-gotten gains.

Having thus brought the King to the 15th. year of his most unhappy reign, and
showed out by what means, ways and instruments he raised monyes to supply his
necessities, and prodigallities of the Court; what hitherto he acted, was in
calm and peaceable times, though not without murmuration; We shall anoncome to
the hostile, that fatal and sanguinary part of his unfortunate reign. He had
hitherto led on his design in a fore-game, yet still in his wonted way of
want, the Queen Mother arriving, holp on his expenses, Strafford the
Archbishop, and Cotington, as the Kings prime agents had fitted all necessaries
in a readiness; both the English and Irish patient in what formerly they had
suffered, and ready to be ridden and spurred to the quick; the mode of the
French Government being still in the eye of the Kings design (as left unto him by
his Fathers legacy) and now again revived and quickened by the Queen Mothers
instigation, a Lady fatal to all places wheresoever she resided; Strafford
having raised in Ireland an Army of Papists, to help on, and at a deah lift:
and about this time there were diverse Commissions issued out to certain Lords
and Gentlemen, with power to impose new and unheard* of Imposts on all the
commodities of the Land, and in addition to these, Commissions were granted to
the Earl of Arundell to take the military charge of the Northern parts into his
hands, another to the Earl of Worcester to raise an army of Papists in Wales,
as it is well known, to master the West marches and to assist the Irish Army
landing at Milford as need should require; and the President my Lord of
Bridgewater commanded to wave that place for his Majesty's special service, a
person as it seems, that was too honest to be wrought upon: At the same time
his Lordship Cottington was likewise made Lord Warden of the Tower, with
authority to take in Soldiers, and to fortify that piece, which accordingly
was put in execution, and the White-Tower planted with many great Ordnance,
with their mouths forced against the City, to the great amazement of the
Citizens and the whole Kingdom. What the King meant or intended by these
irregular and prodigious acts of his, let the most wilful Malignant make his
own judgment, when as the whole Kingdom was never in a greater calm of peace,
loyalty and quietness, or in any appearance of insurrection. The Excise at
that instant was likewise in agitation, and the very same house, wherein now
that office is erected in Broadstreet taken by Cottington to the same purpose,
and Strafford much aabout that time dispatched into Ireland, there to call a
Parliament for assistance in relation to the intended Scotch War, where he
musters a new the Irish army, gets four Subsidies, and presently returns for
Engl. where a Parl. for the same end was likewise summoned; not any thing now
stood as Remora, in the way of the Kings great design, but those refractory
Scots, this was the block that in the first place must be removed; to begin
this work of darkness, first fomented by the Bishops, especially Canterbury
here, and that pragmattick Prelat of Scotland, Maxwell; with Hamilton and
Traquair on the by. These two assisted by Strafford, had the whole managery of
that affair.

We must not too much insist on every particular, this Scotch work alone
requiring a volume to derive it from its first fountain and original, as a
project of the old Kings, to introduce the Episcopal power and Church
Government there conformable to that of England, and to suppress or master
that of the Kirk and Presbyterian power, as the only obstruction to absolute
Sovereignty.

Gods providence and his ways are insearchable, and the carriage of this work
of darkness is very remarkable, it has left the world in a maze how the
Kings designs by this Scotch enterprise should turn and overthrow the whole
frame and fabric of all his former projections, and of so fair a fore-game,
so to bring it about, as on the very nick of the accomplishment, to lose both
it, his reputation and life, and at a time when all wise men had given the
freedoms of the English nation utterly lost, and merely by the wilfulness of
his own irregular motions, more beloved, reverenced and obeyed, than any of his
Predecessors.

The state of the three Kingdoms, as abovesaid, but a little before this
Scotch enterprise ( as to a any War from abroad, mutinies and insurrections
at home) was well known to be in as great a calm of Peace and quietness as in
any reign since the Conquest, the subject passive, loyal and obedient to the
Kings will and pleasure, himfelf at peace and amity with all his Allies,
Confederates, and Neighbour-Princes; nothing could be Imagined to have troubled
him but his own ambition, and those restless appetites of his which would not
suffer him to enjoy content in the midst of prosperity, and to rest satisfied
in the fruition of more abundance than ever any King of England attained unto;
In this requiem (could he have seen it) was his soul restless, and as we may
of truth say, by no instigation more troubled than by hers which had the honor
of his Bed; an unhappy unquietness which his principal privadoes rather added
fuel to the fire thereof than water to quench it; they had studied his
inclination, which was the rule they walked by, not how to apply wholesome
medicines to cure the raging malady of his ambition, which by none was more
cherished than by the Bishops and his formal clergy, in the way wherein his
will and lust had predominance over his reason, such as had not only taken the
same fiery infection, but as much labored therein, as himself, whose sunction
and office (if grace had guided them) it properly was rather to have applied
antidotes than venom to their Masters disease, and to have told him plainly
where the fault lay.

But to return to the relation of this Scotch enterprise; the King as before
is intimated, through mere necessity was induced to call a Parliament (not to
reform abuses crept into the Commonwealth (better it may be said violently
introduced through his ill Government and discontinuance of Parliaments, the
ancient remedies of public grievances) but to supply his own wants in
reference to the war intended; the Kings wants being more pressing than ever,
the servants of his own side in Court, a good space before debard of their
Wages, purposely to scrape up moneys toward this needless War; the Queens
Servants on the other side were notwithstanding exactly paid.

It would be superfluous and impertinent to describe the whole story of this
design, so obvious and generally known to all the Kingdom; how first this
affair was carried on by sending a new Litturgy to EDINBVRGH, as an experiment
how the Scots would swallow the first bayt to their inthraldome; how there the
Litturgy was resented, and with what after disgusts it was not only refused but
detested, How that Traquire and Hamilton one after the other were Commissioned
with power and instructions to enforce their conformity; what Flames,
Invectives, and Comments flew here abroad of the Bishops penning of their
Rebellion; how again the Scots stood upon their punctillioes, in defense of
themselves and their Covenant against this innovation; how many Petitions and
Messages past between them and the King; how at last on dispute between their
Commissioners and his Majesty's, at their first Treaty in the North, and the
averseness of the Kings soldiers to embrace the quarrel, the King granted them
his royal Pascification, and sent them home well satisfied; how again on his
Majesty's return, his act of Pascification was here in Court resented, by the
Queen and the Bishops, and with what Language the King was affronted to have
brought home a dishonorable Peace, and obstructive to his own designs; how
then this needless and wilful quarrel was revived, and the Kings
Pacification vilified and burnt by the hands of the common Hangman, and the
King easily brought on anew to muster a second Army, to subdue those stubborn
and rebellious Scots, as generally then, especially by the Bishops they were
styled: when as by the Free Quarter of his first Army, most parts of the County
of York were beggered and the Soldiery unpaid, how the Parliament and generally
the people abhorred this war, and refused to contribute toward it, how
thereupon quinto Maij 1649. it was suddenly dissolved, how on the very same day
the Cabinet Council sat in close consultation at White Hall how to raise
moneys to defray the charge of this second war, how that Paper (the results of
that Council) after (styled, The Juncto) came to be preserved by the means of
Sir Henry Vane the younger, and Mr. Pym, who imparted it the ensuing
Parliament, as the star which guided them to know the authors and projectors of
this and other wilful designs; what preparations the Scots made to defend
themselves, and how with a puissant Army they first entered the Kingdom under
the Command of Lesley, who made his way by force, with some loss of blood on
both sides at Newburn, and after that marched peaceably to Newcastle, which he
fortifyed, and from thence sent a Petition in the name of the whole Nation to
the King, that their cause might be heard, before more blood should be drawn,
which before was utterly denied them, with contemptuous acerbity, The
particulars whereof shall God willing in all sincerity be anon amply declared,
together with such discoveries as are not yet publicly known, and so
particularly manifested in many points, as in the following Reply and
Animadversions may appear, both for the general satisfaction, and such
Royalists to whom I have heartily addressed them, as well for their own
conversion, as also in vindication and farther manifestation of Truth, and to
the everlasting honor of this Parliament, whom God has visibly enabled with
courage both to foresee and withstand the violences of a Prince, who in all his
Expresses, Protestations, and overtures for Peace and Accommodation with the
Parliament, were inseparably accompanied with dissemblings, fraud, wiles and
reservations, may be further manifested by the evident proofs of his Letters
under his own hand writing, his Commissions, Missives, and many other
authentic Testimonies, though many of them noted, and long since exposed and
set out to the world, and answered in the Parliaments Declarations, especially
manifested in that of No more Addresses; yet not so vulgarly seen, as they may
be on a more exact veiw, and a diligent perusal, and comparing the Kings
public expresses with his private practices, as may apparently be seen by any
that will but take the pains either to read them in his own Character, or mine.

Whence arises the great wonder of the times, how, and with what face, either
the King himself living should with such boldness stand on his justification,
or that any since his death (endued with common sense and reason) can have the
Impudence to defend him dead, who living so wilfully, fraudulently, and
obstinately persevered in pursuance of his own lustful and pernicious
designs, in invassalating the poor people, which, until himself gave, and
prosecuted the occasion of their falling from him, and were enforced to
withstand his violent courses, was more beloved, honored, and obeyed than any
of our Kings. A Prince that raised and wasted more Treasure, wilfully spilt
more Innocent blood, devasted more the lands and habitations of his Subjects,
ruined more families, and more imbroyled three flourishing Kingdoms, than all
of his Progenitors; and yet for all these his prodigious cruelties and
misdemeanors to be inshrin'd (dead) for a martyr, both alive and dead adored
for a Saint.

We shall now close up the first part of our Breviary, as it relates to his
reign, and designs before he erected his Standard, the manner and managery of
the hostile part of his life (though both long since sufficiently known, and
felt by many thousands of the poor innocent people of three Kingdoms, yet for
avoiding of repetitions and some other motives) I have taken the leave to
insert a short description thereof in the subsequent reply; leaving out the
manner of his arraignment by his Judges, all of them to be adjudg'd a new at
the great Tribnnall of the King of Kings, whether the one (as his Vicegerent)
has ruled and judged the people committed to his protection for their defense,
and has dealt uprightly with them, or not, and whether the others (as ordained
by divine providence to do justice on him for his cruelties) have condemned
this King for his Tyranny and unrighteous dealing with three nations, to whose
justice, in fear and trembling we must all submit.

Where we may with good reason make this Quaere, Whether the cutting off of our
bloody and blood-thirsty Prince, together with the exclusion of his whole
posterity, can be a sufficient expiation in the eye of heaven, for the blood of
a million of poor innocent souls slaughtered for the satiating of one Princes
lustful will and pleasure, since he that repents not has said it, that the
Land shall not be cleansed until the blood of one murderer be shed, this we may
say and safely believe, that Almighty God (for the sins of the Nations) in his
wrath and just indignation, sent this most unhappy King (as his rod of
judgment) to reign over us, and in his justice has likewise burnt it, and
brought that fatal end upon him, and his Fathers house, according to his own
and often Imprecations: We shall conclude this first scene of our Narrative
with the Kingdoms fate:

Iratus Deus dedit ijs Regem.
The Authors reply to an invective Remonstrance against the Parliament and
present Government, wherein the whole managery of the late War is exactly
described.
SIR,
HAving diligently perused the replication you sent me, I perceive that you are
no changeling, but one and the self same man in your opinion, both in
justifying the late Kings Actions, and in aspersing the Parliament with raising
the late War against him, as a premeditated Plot long since hatched by a
factious party amongst them, and to change the Government, and pull up Monarchy
and Episcopacy by the roots; Strange Chimaeras indeed, that dropped lately out of
the Clouds and Vapors of your own and your parties gyddy-braines; neither do
you rest there, but you proceed to charge those which now sit at Westminster
with many other foul Calumnies; to all which in their proper place I shall not
fail to give you a particular answer; though I could have wished, that you had
fixed your cogitations on some other subject suitable to truth, and the
ingenuity you pretend unto, and not after ten years revolution of time to fall
flat on a mere suggestion of your own without any other proof than a bare
allegatiou, and that so destitute of possibility, either of thought or intent
in the Parliament to effect, as that the affirmation seems to me a mere
malicious fiction of your own rather than a simple verity, and so unbecoming a
Gentleman of your quality, as that in plainness I take the boldness to tell
you, you might on better reason with Copernicus his Disciples, have aver'd
another world to be in the Moon, th^n to have devised and broached so vain and
senseless an untruth; But since it is more of your will than chance, to fall on
so groundless a fable and on a theme so old and over-worne; might I have
advised, you should have turned your tone (which would have been much more for
your honor) and aver'd, that the King, even from the very first entrance of
his reign (answerable to his Fathers instructions) began his arbitrary work,
and in pursuance thereof had laid sundry destructive and dark plots, how to
invassalate the three Nations, and by degrees to reduce them all under one
Entire, arbitrary and absolute sovereignty; and when they took not the effect
he desired, being discovered and opposed by this Parliament, then to set up his
Standard and array the poor people against themselves, which never any King of
England durst attempt, otherwise than by public consent, and against a
foreign enemy, and at last to wage open Narre against his own subjects, and
the representative of the Nation, Plundering, Fyring, and desolating the
Kingdom to the utmost of his power; had you avouched thus much, you had hit on
the right, and showed your self both a friend to truth and your Country; but
it seems you still stand close to your old destructive principles, as at first
you sided with the King living, so dead you persist to make good his cause,
whether right or wrong it mattered not much, with most of your party, the truth
is, how good or bad soever his cause was, it was the bare name of a King and
hopes of preferment which drew your Iron into the field, and it is the very same
at present which invites all of you to flatter and sooth up your selves with
the empty name of Loyalty to bring in the new Crowned King of Scots on the old
score, without looking to the preservation of the Liberty of your Country, and
proprieties of your own posterity and the sad consequence thereof, as if the
public interest ought to be given up, for the fulfilling of your desires, and
of one man's wilful pleasure, a strange dotage that has possessed you, and more
strange it is, that you should now fall a fresh on a subject that loathes any
man of ingenuity to think on it, much more to treat on a theme so stale, were
it but in reference to the memory of him who is at rest: But since I find that
a kind of confidence possesses your intellectuals, that all your allegations
are unanswerable, and that your provocations amounts to a challenge, the fault
must be yours not mine, If in vindication of truth, I lay open the grossnesse
of all your errors, in the manifestation of his which with such eagerness and
confidence you think your self able to defend being forced through your
importunity, and the nature of the task you put upon me, to run over the whole
progres and managery of all the late Kings designs, visible and long since very
well known to all men of common understanding; though I confess, I do not
much marvel that your self (amongst the rest of the facill belief) have been
deceived by the Kings woonted and plausible protestations, especially as he
handled the matter, in the cunning and umbragious carrying on of all his close
and hidden designs: for I very well know many knowing* Gentlemen which have had
a long conflict with themselves, what judgment to make on the first difference
arising between the King and Parliament, his Majesty so often protesting, how
much he intended the welfare of all his subjects, how unwilling to embrew the
Kingdom with blood, how willing to embrace and conserve the peace of the Land,
how resolved to maintain the true Protestant Religion, how careful and
studious to uphold the Laws and Liberties of the People, how ready to preserve
inviolable the privileges of Parliaments, and how forward to supply his
distressed Protestant Subjects in Ireland; all which (as a Copy of his
counterfeit Countenance) he so often protested, and confirmed with
Imprecations, that truly the spirits of many wise men were amazed and a long
time stood staggering what to be. lieve in the case, and doubtful whether the
Kings cause or the Parliaments was most just, which party gave the first
offense, which began the War, and of this number I confess my self to be
one, which stood sometimes diffident in a controversy so variously attested;
but having made a diligent search into all the passages, and transactions
between both parties, both from before the Sword was drawn, and after to the
year 1645, when the Kings Cabinet Letters were taken at Naseby, and other
manifests elsewhere, I then began to bethink my self (that which before I only
admitted in a kind of Ambitious belief) that the Parliament had then to deal
with a King (howsoever heretofore valued as a Prince of no deep reach) who was
not to seek without the help and influence of a malicious Council) to play his
own part, I shall not say better, but more dextrous and cunningly for his own
ends, and to the reducing of the Kingdoms under his absolute power, than any
of those could direct him, whom he most trusted with the mannagery of his
designs and secrets; truly, Sir, on that discovery (on the publishing of his
Letters) let me tell you there were many thousands which fell off, and from the
opinion they held of his integrity and the Justice of his Cause, it being in
the next degree to a miracle that after so full a disclosure of the Kings
juglings and dissemblings there should any remain to take his part, and the
wonder is the more remarkable that since his death any man should believe him
to be a Martyr, but whom God hardens they shall be hardened, let the Charmer
Charm never so wisely some will be deaf and diffident of visible truths
never so clearly manifested, of which number that you should perceveere to make
one, as by your sundry invectives it appears, surely it has not a little
troubled me, to see the excrescencies of your inveterate malignancy to break
out even to obstinacy, and so long to have blinded your judgment, from
discerning of truth from falsehood, and to have bard you from the right use of
distinguishing between reason well weighed, and fraud umbrated and attested,
with the usual artifices of the royal protestations, a faculty (by your
favor) too too common with the King and those quaint penmen which attended
him; with plausible Declarations, frequently sent abroad, ad faciendum populum,
to catch fools, and as the Kings usual phrase was to undeceive the people,
(prepossest with the reality of the Parliaments Remonstrances) when in truth
the Kings ends were no other than to decoy the poor credulous Annimalls into an
opinion of his good meaning toward them, when he intended them most harm, as
we find it evident in the silly devises and quaint impresses of his money
coined at Oxford, pretending that he took up arms in defense of the Protestant
Religion, the Laws and Liberties of the People, and the Privileges of
Parliament, when the direct contrary appeared by all his Actions; and when as
it was manifest, that before he began to quarrel with the Scots, he tacitly
intended, and even then designed to suppress Parliaments, or so to qualify
them, that they should be only useful to his own ends, not to the people, and
likewise to invade the Liberties of the subject, and adulterate the true
Protestant Religion with the superstitious mixture of Popery, as it manifestly
appeared by his admittance of a Jesuiticall crew into his own Court, and
Cappuchins at Somerset House with large maintenance, even in the face of the
Court, and eye of the Kingdom, with a general connivence, amounting to a
tacit toleration to all Papists, together with idolatrous Masses, both in his
own house permitted, andused throughout the Kingdom in most Papists houses
without control, and in imitation of Solomon, after that by his Wives he was
turned Idolater, to set up the abomination of ^1 Kings 11. 4, 5, 6, 7.
Ashteroth, even in the face of Jerusalem: And as to his invading of the
Libertyes of the people, with his many other oppressions and irregularities, we
all know, and have good cause to remember them.

The Breviary of his Life and unfortunate Reign, manifestly declares as to his
intent of suppressing of Parliaments, and future oppression of the people, the
observations I intend to send you, with his own Letters sufficiently
demonstrates, and by whose motion and Counsels those exorbitances were first by
his own Fathers Instructions pursued, found in his Cabinet at Theobalds
immediately after his departure, and whereof one was to quit himself by degrees
of all Parliaments, as too bold Copartners in the Government with their Kings,
and to run the future course of his government answerable to that of France;
and to verify this I shall point you to King James his own Speech in open
Parliament, 1609. March 21. Where you may see what preparations he had provided
for his Successor to rule by: parallelling himself with God who he says, Has
power to create or destroy, make, or un make at his pleasure, to give life, or
send death, to judge all, and to be judged or to be accomptable to none, to
raise low things, and to make high things low at pleasure, and to God are both
Soul and Body due; the like power, says this King, have Kings, they make and
unmake their Subjects, they have power of raising and casting down, of life and
death, Judges over all their Subjects, and in all causes, and yet accomptable
to none but God alone, they have power to exalt low things, and abase high
things, and to make of their Subjects like men at Chess, a pawn to take a
Bishop, or a Knight, and to cry up and down their Subjects, as they do their
money.

Whence you may observe this Kings Principles, which in the Speech it self
every where extant you may find, that even this King, whom the world styled the
Platonicall King, and was reputed a pious Prince, took the hint of his
tyrannical principles from a Mountague.
Bishop, who in the very face and audience of a Court of Parliament, preached
all these fine arbitrary doctrines, and yet in the Speech it self, fol. quarto,
you shall find the King defends him: Hence you way perceive by whose counsels
the late King steered all the course of his government after his accession to
the Crown, with the reason of his seldom calling of Parliaments, and his often
dissolving of such as he did call without their due effects. I shall now
faithfully relate the whole progress of the War, and by what female advice he
was directed to the reducing of all the three Kingdoms under his absolute
power, and for your better satisfaction shall by the way present you with the
orignall cause of his hatred against this Parl. and by what strange means it
was summoned, and at a time when all wise men had given all Parliaments for
lost, which although long since, and by many more able pens than mine have been
sufficiently manifested to the world, yet for your sake, I shall adventure to
present them a new, as having little more in addition to the elabourate pains
of others, than in some particulars which I find not as yet produced to the
light of the world: Briefly then, It is a known truth that the King in that
his unnecessary raising of a war against the SCOTS, and through the
prodigality of the Court, especially the petulancy and lavishnesse of the
Queens side, had so exceedingly exhausted both his Exchequer and Credit, and
reduced himself to that extreme Indigence, that he knew not whither to turn
himself, neither (as in the Breviary of his Reign is exactly laid down) could
that great headpiece, and the grand Master for carrying on of all his
Arbitrary work, show him how to dis-intangle himself out of that harle,
wherein his own wilful Inclinations had encumbered him: We all know, that the
King on the entrance of the Scots at Newborn, in August 1640. took a posting
journey Northward to his Army, Strafford being Commissioned General in the
room of the Earl of Northumberland, whither they were no sooner arrived, but
they found the Soldiery in little better than mutiny for want of their pay;
the whole army then lying on Free Quarter on the County of York, and the King
without so much money as would pay half a Regiment, the Scots possessed of the
Town of Newcastle, the Nobility having been exhausted in their attendance the
Summer before, yet to show their loyalty, they again repair to York; amongst
the rest, the Earls of Hartford and Essex in their journey take an occasion by
the way to address themselves to the Queen, to whom they declare the sad
condition wherein both the King and Kingdom were then reduced, and that they
saw no possible means, other then a Parliament, whereby to repair the State,
relieve the King, and piece up the rents and breaches between both Nations; on
this expostulation they prevailed with the Queen to write her Letters to his
Majesty, to move him to condescend to the summons of this Parliament, the
mention whereof they very well knew without such a mediatrix would be very
displeasing unto him; these Lords being thus provided with her Majesty's
Letters, repair to York, and presented them to the King, and upon consultation
with the rest of the Lords then attending his Majesty, five and twenty of them
join in a Petition to that purpose: The Scots likewise, and 200 Gentlemen of
the County of York concurring in the same suit for a present summons of a
Parliament. Thus was his Majesty (as I may say) beleaguered on all hands, not
anyone but Strafford dissenting; in the end, what between the Kings urgent
necessities, and a concurrency of Petitions, together with the Queens Letters
(which weighed most with the King) was this Parliament contrary to the
expectation of all men, produced, to the admiration of the Kingdom, though
against the Kings express vow, taken at the putting off his robes (as before
is mentioned) when he dissolved his second Parliament, and in a contemptuous
deportment, threw them from him, protesting that it should be the last time of
their putting off or on: Hence we may discern through what difficulties and
streights this Parliament took it is beginning, we may well say, by Gods
special providence, and by hers principally as the isntrumental cause
thereof, which soon after was it is greatest Enemy, and not by the Kings choice
and inclination, as it is shamefully averred in his Pourtraicture, whereas, the
bare name and mention of a Parliament was well known to be odious unto him, and
the very motion of calling any more prohibited, by his own express charge to
all of his Council of State, as that which he foresaw would be the only
impediment to the accomplishment of all his arbitrary designs so merely
brought to their ends, but the summer before he waged the first war against
his native subjects the Scots, an enterprise which the World knows was the
only Remora that checked and choked all his projections in the maturity of
their birth, which to recover on sight, and his sense of the Parliaments
proceedings he soon found he had no other way left him but by open War and
force to suppress them, the mannagery whereof I shall now briefly present unto
you.

The Parliament had its Summons from York (as all the Kingdom knows) and the
third of November 1640. sat down at Westminster, where according to the
usual Ceremonies, the King in his own person, in a set speech made a very
gracious protestation, viz. That he was fully resolved to put himself wholly on
the love of his People and Parliament, which if it proved not prosperous and a
happy Parliament the fault should be none of his, and that he was fully
determined to commit the reformation of all things amiss to their regulation.
A profession which both took much with the House and all the Kingdom, which had
he been pleased to have performed, and to have made good his word, in not
protecting the many delinquents, questioned within a few months after the
Parliaments first sitting down, as with justice, honor, and his Coronation
oath he was obliged, and in reference to his own profit he might very well
have forborne, such tragical issues could never have befallen himself and the
3. Kingdoms: but having then entertained other designs, and perceiving the
Parliament to fly high, and at his chief Ministers and woork-masters of his
former arbitrary projects, and on those which had fomented that unnecessary
War against the Scots, as the Earl of Straf ford and the Archbishop
(principally) the Prelates and dissolute Clergy, most of the Judges and the
Farmers of the Customs, (not for common faults, but very high misdemeanors)
the King to cross them, most ignobly and against the justice of the Kingdom,
not only provoked, but openly showed himself both a defendor and protector of
their Delinquencies, and upon the distaste he took on the commitment of
Strafford, was instantly known to have laid sundry plots and practices, how he
might dissolve the Parliament, or utterly to destroy it, which the Parliament
perceiving, and that the Queen under color of accompanying the Princess Mary
into Holland, was sent thither with the Crown Jewels to buy Arms, and procure
forces to be sent him, and Digby employed to the same purpose; whereupon in
prevention of the storm which they evidently then saw was like to fall on
themselves and the Kingdom from beyond sea, they moved his Majesty that the
Kingdom might be put into a posture of defense, and the militia deposited in
such hands, as they might confide in, which he utterly refused to grant them as
inseparables to the Crown (as he alleged) he was resolved to keep solely in
his own power; The Parliament in answer to this, insist, That the Kings power
therein, by the Law of the Land, was only fiduciary, always in reference to
trust, and the publik good and safety of the Kingdom; hence the contest by
degrees grew to a separation, and in furtherance of the dispute, he also denied
the house to disband the Irish Army, raised long before by Strafford, and
composed of Papists, a storm which could not otherwise be expected but would
(if not timely prevented) fall on them from Ireland, whereof the Vide the
Juncto.
Juncto at their very first sitting down had sufficiently informed them out of
Straffords own mouth for what use and end that Army was raised, viz. where he
tells the King, you have an Army in IRELAND to reduce this Kingdom, when it was
manifestly known to the world, that it never was in a greater calm of peace and
quietness, and the universal people in a more absolute obedience, and as ready
to be ridden as any slaves under the Grand Signior.

During this conflict, the King would needs take a journey into Scotland,
notwithstanding the House by sundry petitions had earnestly moved him, either
to lay it aside, or at least for some time to retard it, (but howsoever the
King carried on his plots and intentions in the dark, and with as much cunning
as possibly could be devised) yet they had then good reason to suspect, that
his journey Northward was to some other end, than in leaving them to visit his
Scotch Parliament, as it after proved; but on he would for Scotland, and before
he took his journey, in a seeming providence to disburthen the Kingdom of the
charge of the Scotch Army, he first pressed the house to disband (with all their
expedition) that Army, and to pay pay that of his own raising in the North, but
not a word of disbanding it; upon this motion the House took it into their
serious consideration (apprehending it for a provident, careful, and timely
motion of the Kings) and thereupon bethought themselves, how first to disband
and quit the Kingdom of the Scots until Mr. Stroude standing up, told the
Speaker, That they ought not in such haste to depart with the Scotch Army, lest
the sons of Zerviah (in their absence) would be too hard for them, this
speech the house soon apprehended, and instantly resolved not to disband the
one without the other army, which the King perceiving, and being daily pressed
with Petitions of the Officers of his own Army fot their pay, and himself not
possibly able to content them, as also, that 25000 l. per mensem, allowed to
the Scots Army, with 300000 l. by way of brotherly love given them by the
Parliament in compensation of their losses through the Kings needless and
unnecessary molesting them, during the two Summers before, amounted in the
total to so vast a sum, as that neither himself was able to contribute a
groat, or the Parliament otherwise to discharge, but by borrowing it on the
Public Faith.

It would amaze those which are happily ignorant of the managery of this work,
if I should tell them in what extremity of want the King was then reduced, and
how he durst adventure to struggle, and after to trip up the heels of a Court
of Parliament, which, without the least upraiding him with his profusions, and
irregular Regality were not only willing and ready to pay all those vast scores
of debts contracted through his own wilful misgovernment, but then had it in
agitation, how to improve his Revenues, and to enable him to live of himself
without squeezing his Subjects, in honor, splendor and plenty beyond any of
his Progenitors as it is well known to many of his own party who were of that
Committee, Sir John Broke, Sir Ralph Hopton, Mr. Partridge, and Mr. Green, were
of that Committee.
touching the improving of an annual revenue to be settled upon him by act of
Parliament, out of one particular, the Customs amounting to 400000 li. per
annum, proposed by old Mr. Turner the Farmer of the Allom works, and the same
so much forwarded, that it was committed by Votes of the Parliament, to a
select number of Members, to be considered, and shortly after was stated to a
proportion of 200000 l. more per annum than ever he received out of the great
and petty farms, but that the world may know the wilfulness of this King,
after that he was gone from the Parliament, and had erected his Standard at
Nottingham, he sent word by Master Levison by name, and one of his Bedchamber,
to Turner, That if ever he meddled with the Parliament about that business
thenceforth, not to look him in the face; whence it evidently appears, that he
meant not to take any thing of the Parliament by way of gift, having it in
design to take what he pleased, as power should enable him. God knows I send
you no Fables, but shall willingly be accomptable of any thing which you shall
find herein inserted, if it suit not with the naked truth and sincerity of him,
who would not that your self and so many of the English Nation should be any
longer deluded and flamm'd with untruthes, and nursed up in a belief of want of
the Parliaments good and loyal intentions toward him, until he had wilfully
and desperately made himself incapable of the love and loyalty of his people;
and such was the ingratitude of this unhappy King, for proof whereof amongst
many instances that I could present, and of his careless paying where he
borrowed, and ruining of many of his servants, let this one suffice of Mr.
Turner, tow hom he owed no small sums, promised much and often, as he did to
many others, but performed nothing, when it was the least thought of his heart;
the after-story, as a known truth, will both show forth his ingratitude, and
the extremity of his want, with those sordid shifts he was put unto, both at
the sitting down of this Parliament and long before, when the poor old man
petitioned him for the nomination of a Baron, which is most true, that the King
granted him without scrupie, provided he named a Gent. and of worth; in short,
it was my Lord Capel, and he was to give him in ready money, 10000 l. but the
King sending for the old man, told him of his want, and that he would gratify
him otherwise with double that sum; so the King as it is well known flattered
the good old man out of his money, which was presently given to the Queen
Mother for her Transportation hence into Germany, and the old Gentleman left to
seek his bread, and to die a very poor man; many instances of this kind I
could relate, but to return to our relation: the Parliament then moved the
City for the loan of so much present money as might serve to discharge the
arrears due to both Armies, which the Citizens denied, unless an act might
pass for the Parliaments sitting during pleasure; the Citizens well remembering
the Kings wonted and sudden dissolving of all the Parliaments of his Reign.

The King then finding where the Remora lay, readily past that bill in relation
to his own debt, which has been since both by himself and his party so much
magnified for an Act of Grace surpassing all of his Progenitors, and shortly
thereupon takes his journey toward Scotland, which considering his own hidden
designs, was chosen in so fit a conjuncture of time, as that he overtooke the
Scotch Army in their march before they past the borders, where what overtures
he made to the Commanders to join with him against the Parliament, best appears
by the notice thereof given and sent by them to the Parliament and their own
Commissioners here then residing The King then finding that neither the English
or Scotch Armies would be wrought upon, answerable to his designs, posts to
Edinburgh, where he very well understood, that to keep the Scots quiet,
necessarily he should be compelled to give that Parliament all the content they
desired, as it is maifestly known he did in all things they demanded, and in many
Acts of Grace, which to the English Parliament he utterly denied, and stood
upon even to the last, as the Militia, the choice of their Admiral,
Chancellor, Judges, etc.

During the Kings abode in Scotland, which was near upon four months, it is
well known the Irish Rebellion brake forth in October 1641. and that rising
authorized under the great Seal of Scotland, as both the Rebels themselves
aver'd, and that attested by diverse witnesses of credit, which had seen it
under Seal: the Parliament here at that time had a recesse, only so many of the
Members as might keep up the reputation of a Parliament resided at Westminster,
the rest were retired unto their habitations until November following, when by
order of the Houses they were all to re-assemble, in the mean time, whilst
most of the Lords and Commons were in the Country happened that Rebellion; the
Parliament by this time and at their coming together, had to their old, a new
work cut out to their hands, what the King could not accomplish either in
England or Scotland, by the way of insurrections and disturbances in both those
Kingdoms, he had fore-laid the way to do it in Ireland, howsoever grossly
palliated and denied in his Pourtracture, yet so suspicious of foul play, as
that on a right understanding of the mannagery of the peace, and the slye
carrying on of the whole business, between himself and the Marquess of
Ormond, (to be seen in his own Letters) makes it plain that he had a perfidious
hand therein.

Now as to his preparations from France and Holland, wherewith to Invade the
Parliament, its manifest he had then in readiness a very considerable
proportion of all sorts of ammunition, and many men, at least in expectation,
to be sent him at a call.

About the beginning of December following the King (having (as he conceived)
made sure work with the Scots) comes to London, where at his first coming to
the House, he makes open profession, what content he had given to his Scotch
Parliament, even to a kind of ostentation, and as to this Parliament some
dislikes he was pleased to take against them for that in his absence they had
no better forwarded their work; and as to his reception in the City it was
magnificent, and as it seemed very well pleasing to himself, sure it was to
the people and all the spectators, which suspected nothing of his ill meaning
toward the Parliament.

The King by this time having been at home much about 20 days had a new and
another kind of game to play than that of meriment, he found that the
Parliament was then much distracted (as good reason they had) with the
apprehension of the Irish insurrection, and that horrible slaughter there
committed on the poor English Protestants, and that they stood not a little in
jelousie and affrighted at their assiduall intell igence received from beyond
sea of the Kings preparations, and that his heart was not right toward them;
but of this he had determined to put them soon out of doubt, and the more to
confuse them, conceiving that the Citizens would on all occasions be wholly for
him, having in his approach to the City in his return from Scotland, and his
entry into the Suburbs, and throughout all the City, courteously saluted the
people by the often putting off his Hat (as before is intimated) a favor which
till then neither himself or his Father before him had never bestowed upon the
vulgar (when (as it after appeared) his design was to make use of them, having
in readiness, and shortly after filled whitehall with the forlorn Officers of
his Casheered Army, he takes an occasion under pretense of suspicion of Treason
to send for Sir Arthur Hasterigge, Mr' Hollis, Mr. Pym, Mr. Stroude, and Mr.
Hamden, of the Commons House, and my Lord Kimboulion of the Lords House, by one
of his Sergeants at Arms, which being denied him by the House (as a plain
breach of their privileges.)

The very next day being the fourth of January, he comes attended with his
guards, and those armed Cavaleers, and entered into the House of Commons, sits
down in the Speakers Chair, and demands the foresaid six Members, which, upon
private intelligence given them of the Kings intent, had absented themselves;
the King missing his prey grew exceedingly into choler, and vowed that he
would have them wheresoever they were; his own comportment and the demeanor of
the Cavallers, both in desperate words and big looks was so terrible to the
Parliament that they forsook the House and sat in the City, sending out a
Declaration of the high breach of their Privileges, together with a Petition to
his Majesty that he would be pleased to grant them a guard for the security of
their persons and sitting, which true it is it, was granted them, but with such
a person for the command, as that they durst not accept of him, but were
compelled to remain for their safety a longer space in the City, until the
Lord Major and the Citizens readily assisted them, and for their better
security brought them in Coaches strongly guarded to Westminster, whither also
resorted a considerable party daily passing along by Whitehall Gates to their
rescue in case the Cavaleers should have again disturbed their consultations,
on this party the Cavaleers falls a beating them whereof some they killed, even
at the Court gate, until a greater number came to their assistance. The King
finding himself then deceived in his expectation, and that the people were
generally devoted to the Parliament, he makes several visits into the City,
where in a public audience be partly complains of the affronts done to him by
the Parliament in their detaining the six Members, and partly excusing his
unadvisednesse in his entering the house in that manner as he did (which is
evident by his own Declaration) but finding at last, that his hopes failed him
to have any assistance out of the City against the Parliament, he stood some
time in doubt what course to take, but in the end resolves under the specious
pretexts of his Insafety by reason of the Tumults, (as since himself styles
them) not to stay at Whitehall any longer; thereupon he departs from his own
Court and the Parliament, as more fully hereafter I shall take occasion to
remember. Hitherto I have presented you with nothing but that which is obvious,
and long since known to all the Kingdom, having as briefly as I could,
deduced the story, from the third of November 1640. which was the very day that
the Parliament sat down, to January 1641, near about the latter end whereof
the King removed from Whitehall to Hampton Court, Windsor, and Theobalds,
accompanied with his wonted guard of Ruffians; the Parliament continuing still
to petition him for his return, and concurrence with them; but no persuasions
or arguments would prevail, but on he goes Northward, and makes his residence
at York, whither he draws by degrees many of the Lords and Commons from the
Parliament, most of the Delinquent party resorting unto him, together with my
Lord Digby from beyond sea, though with his own approbation long before
proclaimed Traitor; thither also (notwithstanding the several affronts done to
the Parliaments Messages and Messengers) they ceased not to importune his
return; but nothing could move him against his will and inclinations, for now
he had another game to play, having hitherto failed in all his practices, and
(as he conceived) his designs then grown to maturity, his next plot was to
seize on the Town of Hull, by the Earl of Newcastle, where a very great
Magazine of Arms and Ammunition had been deposited the Summer before, which the
King had also refused to return to the Tower; and the Town of Newcastle by
Colonel Leg was likewise to be seized on, both maritime towns and of great
importance for the letting in of all strangers to his assistance; whereof the
Parliament having certain intelligence, and by all the Kings former courses
being more fully assured from abroad apprehending the dangerous consequence
thereof thought then it more than high time in what possibly they could, (for
the safety of themselves and the Kingdom) to prevent the mischiefs, which they
then evidently perceived threatened the universal Nation, and thereupon they
suddenly dispatched the two Hothams with Commission to pre-possesse the Town by
the Trained Bands of those parts: here you may see the first arms that ever
the Parliament appeared in, unless you shall urge the guards which the City
sent them for securing their persons from the fury of the Cavaliers, which
admit, it was only defensive, to preserve themselves and the Kingdom, in what
possibly they might, and in prevention of future storms, which they inevitably
saw were sure to fall upon them from abroad; and had they not gone farther, in
seizing on the Navy, the Tower, Forts, Castles, and Ammunition, together with
the Crown Revenues, which are the Nerves and strengths of the Kingdom, which
had they neglected, no man can make doubt but they would have been perverted
from their proper use, and turned against the Kingdom; surely then when they
perceived that nothing would work upon the Kings obstinacy, but that he was
resolved to make War, and to embroyle the whole Kingdom, and let in
strangers, they would have been deemed unworthy of the places they held in the
behalf of their Countries, had they not done as they did. But as to the Kings
part, please you to look over all the progress of his designs, and take them
once more into your second consideration, and you cannot in any reason believe,
but that from the very first commitment of the Earl of Strafford to the lower,
whose escape he had privately plotted, and to send him into Ireland, (as in part
is before noted) but that he intended to force the Parliament to his will, or
utterly to annihillate it, especially when he found that the Earl was
condemned, and his execution pressed (as a public example) to dye, after which
its most certain he meditated nothing more than war, and to be revenged on the
Parliament as it evidently appears by his sending over the Queen into Holland
to buy arms, Cockram into Denmark, and Digby in the same errand, as also by
his practicing of the Army in the North to fall upon the Parliament, together
with the flight of Percy, Jermin, and Suckling, as the only persons first
engaged in that Plot, which durst not stand to the Test, and in order to these,
his peremptory denial to disband the Irish Army, and his private addresses to
other foreign Princes and States to supply him with men, money, and arms, all
which his practices were visibly known to the Kingdom, to have been in
agitation some of them before the Earl of Straffords execution, other shortly
thereupon, which evidently shows, that he was resolved at any rate, and by
force of arms to suppress the Parliament. In the universal disturbance of the
whole Kingdom, you may further observe, how in pursuance of his mischievous
designs, notwithstanding the dislike the Parliament had of his determination
to go into Scotland, and their humble motions to him to lay that journey
aside, or at least for some time to retard it, as before is laid down, yet
would he needs go, and the reasons thereof are perspicuous, considered as he
made choice of his time to overtake the Scotch Army before they came to the
borders, and to attempt to corrupt the Commanders to turn to him, and if that
failed, yet to give his Scotch Parliament all the content they would desire;
take the design farther; What work was made there concerning the Irish
Rebellion? what after his return home he made here, in his assaulting the House
in a warlike posture, and his accusing the six Members (as the most noted
Common-wealths-men) in terror to the rest, upon no other ground but on a vain
surmise of his own making, of suspicion of Treason, where the proof is so plain
by the first shedding of blood at his own doors, and the hostile manner of his
entering the House attended with 300 armed men, and most of them of desperate
and forlorn Fortunes, that the very bare denial that the King made not the
first Ware does surpass even impudence it self: I am not ignorant that the
Kings many protestations, and not a few of them fortified with imprecations,
has taken a firm footing in the belief of many half-witted men, that his
Cause was much better than it was, but the wiser sort make their judgments of
men by their actions, not by their professions, and they believe by the
testimony of their senses, what they see and feel they are bound to believe,
especially when a King in his private inditements which are the dictates of the
Soul, and those addressed to a person which had gained an absolute power over
the faculties of his reason and understanding, such unbeleevers are not fit for
humane society. But omitting repetitions and further Comments, we have left
the King at York, where for your better satisfaction it is fit that I put you
in remembrance how there he pursued the War, in raising the people, and
inviting the Counties both far and near to rise and side with him against the
Parliament, which in the Observations I shall send you will be made more
manifest. But that it may more fully appear upon what further grounds the King
forsook his own house and the Parliament besides the pretended fear of
Tumults (of his own causing) it was suggested unto him, and he was made to
believe, That without his presence and concurrence with the Parliament they
could not, neither durst they vote or act any thing, though never so relative
to the safety of themselves and the Kingdom, so that its apparent, that either
by fraud or force he was resolved to put an end to this Parliament, and for
farther proof of this I refer you to the Observations.

Now as to the main of your accusations, the taking away of the Kings life, and
dis-inheriting of his Posterity, I crave leave to defer this point to the last,
and to the conclusion of my animadversions, where hapyily you will find the
true reasons thereof; and shall now proceed to the Change of the Government
which you charge on the Parliament to be so long since plotted, and as a power
usurped and exercised by them in a dispotical way way of Tyranny, in raising of
money, imposing of taxes, and intolerable contributions on the whole Nation;
to take them apart I shall begin with the change of the Government as it is now
established in the nature of a Republic, which you know to be gotten by the
Sword, and likely so it is to hold, by the same weapon as the Romans, Saxons,
Danes and Normans got their Dominions here by Conquest, and as the late King on
that mere foundation intended to make his power absolute and A la Francoys, in
the needless endeavor whereof, and to be more than stood with the constitution
of the English Sovereignty, you know how he lost all, together with his life;
if your conscience cannot brook the present government as now it is
established, I see no other remedy left you, but to quit the place you now live
in (and quietly if you would) it suffiseth my Conscience that I live under it,
in the enjoyment of somewhat wherewith to subsist, which I am sure was more
than my self and many thousands more could do, when and weresoever the late
Kings armies were prevalent; as to the Taxes and Contributions, whereat you so
much repine as insufferable, and most illegally imposed on the people, all that
I shall say to it is that we which suffer them, may all of us thank your party
for it, as enforced on the States by your only means, for the defense of the
common freedom of the Nation, which as in the beginning of the late Wars,
your party under the royal Commissions invaded, so you continually endeavor
to subvert them, by all the secret plots and practices you possibly can invent,
whereas could that malicious tumor of yours, and that unquietness of your
spirits by allayed, and your selves persuaded by reason, before it invades you,
the taxes you may be sure on it, would soon be abated, why then can you not rest
content with that change and government, which, were you not hood-winkt, you
might manifestly see Gods high and overruling providence to have carried on
the work both in a series of the many and miraculous victories of the
Parliaments, as also in disappointing all the late Kings designs, and in
discovering all your plots and practices, even from the very beginning of the
war to the present, which although they weigh not with you, as men bewitched,
and as I may say, besotted with an incapacity or hardness of heart not to be
convinced by any force of reason, or arguments, though providence it self
visibly shows it out unto you, that not only Gods special hand is in this great
change of affairs, but that he has yet some greater work depending on this,
which in his own good time he will bring to pass, in throwing down that proud
papal Monarchy, and utterly to confound that man of sin who sits in the temple
exaulting himself above God.

Sir, Here may you be pleased to take in your more serious consideration by
whom Kings reign, and cease to reign, and soberly to observe for what sins
almighty God usually striks down the proud Septers of Kings, and binds their
Nobles in chains of Iron, and you may without presumption say, and find it most
true, throughout all the sacred Scriptures, that where Idolatry, Injustice,
Oppression, and Bloodshed have had predominance, there Gods wrath has
inseparably attended the Authors, and favorers, and most severely punished
those sins above all others, and what in these sins have been either permitted,
acted, or connived at by the late King (howsoever faced out and denied by
himself) and most of your party, and his cause shamefully defended, yet I
suppose you cannot but acknowledge that they have not only been winked at, but
backed and authorized cnm privilegio. And here give me leave to tell you, that I
have stood amazed at the impudence of your royal bookmen, I shall only instance
(amongst ma ny) in a sew, as Judge Jenkins his Lex Terrae, and other of his
juggling fragments, the Regal Apology, the Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae; but
especially in that grand imposture of the Kings Pourtracture; in all which,
that they should give the plain lie to truth, conceal and smother the true
intent of the laws of the Land, and contradict the Kings own Letters and
expresses written with his own hand, augments the admiration, and much the more
that they should with such acerbity exclaim against the ripping up of the
faults of the dead, when they themselves give the occasion, in their frequent
invective Pamphlets against the Parliament, and in their justifications of a
Prince, whose inclinations lead him to the fulfilling of his own will, though
to the apparent loss of his Crown, and his dearest friends, so violently were
his inclinations driven on to the accomplishing of his designs, when as neither
the junctoes of France, Spain, Denmark, the States of Holland, or scarce any
Prince Christian, (though most of them of his nearest allies, and solicited by
all the artifices that man could invent) would own own him when they
understood the ways and enterprises he most wilfully undertook, and all of
them (upon due examination) as unnecessarily undertaken, and needlessly pursued
with as much violence and craft, as if they had some necessary dependence on
his own salvation, and the safety of his people, when as God knows, they were
most destructive, the misshapen, and illegitimat births of his own willful
inclinations.

Now it would not be much impertinent to the subject you have sent me, if I
should tell you that I find not any one Nation in the world that has had any
great reason to be overmuch inamored with their Kings, sure I am neither of us
both (how different soever in our principles) have had any great cause given us
to dote on our last, considered, as he reigned in blood and oppression, and
handled the matter both with his friends and foes whether foreign or
domestic; witness those needless Wars he engaged himself against Spayn
and France in the entrance of his reign, afterward with the Scots, but
espetially with this Parliament and the subjects of three Kingdoms, not only to
the beggering of them, but the ruin of himself and his posterity; and yet is
this most wilful and bloody Prince the only King which your party have so
much admired, defended and believed living, and dead, adored and esteemed for a
Saint and a Martyr.

Sir, You are a Gentleman well verst in History, I shall therefore take the
boldness to advise you, to take the right demensions of all the Kings you have
read of, either in the sacred scriptures or profane, observe well all their
actings, and I dare be bold to say that you shall very rarely find any of them
which have strictly tied themselves to the duty of their office or to have
executed their powers otherwise than to the extreme detriment of their
Subjects, take them wheresoever they have been admitted either by the suffrage
of the people (as that has been the best means to keep them within the bounds
of moderation) or permitted by the absurdity of succession, whether wisemen or
fools, whether Children or of mature years or assuming their Soveraignties by
the power of their Swords, and doubtless you shall find few of them which have
been over-mindfull of the good and welfare of their people, neither to have had
any due retrospect to the right ends of Government, and that salus populi the
safety and good of their Subjects, for which all Kings had their powers
originally ordained and given them from God, never for their own private
interests, which most of the Kings of the World have evermore studied to
advance, and generally per fas et nefas right or wrong, endeavored to enforce,
as in this point we have all of us had a late and a lamentable experience;
where take this in the way, that, without all dispute, all Kingly power, and
that despoticall domination of that great hunter Nimrod, which was first by him
usurped by force, and from him as the first pattern of Royalty, dispersed
throughout most parts of the World, yet we find not in all the Scriptures any
vestigia or authentic proof, that the succeeding Kings of the Nations, came to
their powers by any immediate institution from God, but only permissive, though
it is most true, that when such powers were in being, and how usurpatiously
soever obtained, yet submission has been by God himself enjoined to those
which lived under them, until for their injustice and extreme Tyranny God in
his justice determined to transfer their powers to others, as you may
transparently see he has done in our late change; since then other powers than
Kingly are now with us in being, you and I both, which live under them, are
bound in conscience to submit and obey them, for all Romans ^^.
powers are of God. And let me remember you, for its worth your observation,
that the Israelites for a long time had no Kingly Government, but in Egypt, in
the Wilderness, and after in the Land of Canaan, for many hundred years
together were no other than Ambulans Respublica, a walking Commonwealth, and
only governed by Judges and the Princes of their respective Tribes, never by
the absolute power of any one man, Moses himself having his assistants, even
the Princes of the People, until through their own wantonness and contempt of
that Government which God had set over them, and in his providence and love
toward them, knew to be fittest for them, they obstinately rejected the gentle
government of 1 Samuel 8. 3, 4, 5.
Samuel, and weary of their own happiness (surfeiting as they did in the
Wilderness on that delicious food of Quails and Manna, and wishing for the
fleshpots of Egypt) in imitation of the Heathen, they thirsted after a King,
and not unlike to Esops Frogs, they pressed Samuel to change their quiet and
peaceable Block into a furious and devouring Stork, their freedom into slavery,
as first with these Arguments, That thy sons walk not in thy ways, but have
turned aside after lucre, took bribes, and perverted judgment, (foul faults
indeed and happily too true) for wheresoever power (without grace) is invested,
faults there will be, and many times foul ones too; But this was not all that
they resented, it was their ambition and desire of novelty in a vainglorious
affectation that swayed with them to be like their Neighbor Nations, and to
have an illustrious and pompous domination over them; but how this pleased God
that Chapter with others shows us in a very sad dialect; for, God in his wrath
gave them a King according to their desires; yet he commands Samuel to show
them what would be the manner of a King, and what Tyrannies he would exercise
over them; howsoever their hearts being set on a Kingly Government (a glorious
thing indeed in the outward show and splendour thereof) have a King they would
without more dispute, alleging other Arguments to Samuel, viz. That he may
judge over us, go out before us, and fight our battles; But how most of their
Kings executed judgment, and what needless battles they fought for them, and
how much blood of theirs was in many of their Kings reigns wilfully and
profusely spilt by most of the Kings of Judah and Israel, as also what taxes
and tributes were unnecessarily imposed on them, their own Chronicles will best
inform you, and all this Kingly work, what does it amount unto, more than to
fulfill the will and pleasure, and to maintain the pomp and splendour of one
man and his whole family, in the open and privileged oppression of a whole
Nation?

Now if the History of the Kings of Judah and Israel be not sufficient to
inform your judgment of the oppressions and Tyrannies exercised by most of
their Kings as a just judgment of God on the whole Nation, (for I may of truth
aver, that they were a stubborn generation, and God answerable to their own
hearts desires gave them their belly full of Kings when it was too late for
their repentance) then you may pick and choose amongst all the Kings of the
World, and you shall find the best of them little better than Tyrants (yea
David himself a a man of blood, and most perfideous in the case of honest
Vriah) and as the greater Fish in the Sea which eats up the lesser, so Kings on
the Land are commonly no more than Canniballs, man-eaters, and as a good Author
describes them to be ex genere bestiarum rapacium, a sort of ravenous beasts
(an undeniable truth) especially where absolute Sovereignty is usurped by any
one man, and that derived in a succession, which is the evil of all evils, and
the very same which your malignant party so vehemently drives at, to introduce
on the English Nation, and to inslave a free borne people, when your self being
a rational man, very well knows that no man ab origin was born a slave, but
either by his own consent, or by the ambition and pleasure of Tyrants was made
so; for who koows not that all men are of the self-same mold as Kings; neither
were Kings ever ordaind of God to govern their people, otherwise than for their
Romans 13* 4.
good, never to be oppressed and trampled on at theit own wills and lustful
pleasures: But happily you may here charge me to entrench, and press with the
most on the Honor and Power of Kings, I answer, I honor them as Gods own
Ordinance amongst other Powers, and am commanded by the Apostle to make prayers
and supplications for them all, especially for Kings, (and great reason we all
have so to do, lest they devour us alive) but if they presume to break over
those limits and boundaries which Almighty God has set unto them, (as of
those, and what they are you may best instruct your felfe out of Deuteronomy. 17 19.
Ezekiel. 45. 9 46. 18. ^
Deutronomy and Deuteronomy. 17 19. Ezekiel. 45. 9 46. 18.^
Ezekiel, where you shall find the King to be tied up to strict rules, as to
read the law, and to observe it all the days of his life, that his heart be
not lifted up above his brethren; and as the Prophet tells them, take away your
exactions from my people, remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and
justice, etc.) Upon these considerations I hope you will not blame me, though I
have not made one amongst so many which have sided with our late King in
raising of war against his people and their Representative, neither in
plundring and desolating the Kingdom, which howsoever those exorbitances
(amongst other of his faults) have been palliated with as much finenesse of
wit, as the art of man could possibly devise yet I beseech you let truth
appear, which with a little of your patience you may more fully understand, and
then happily you will adjudge him guilty of much more than has been yet
vulgarly charged on his account; in the mean time remember our blessed Saviors
oracle, That it is fit offenses should be, but woe to those which occasion
them: Excuse me then, though I tell you, that I know none more guilty of the
occasion of all our barbarous and brutish wars, bloodshed, rapine, and of the
imminent danger and utter desolation, which at present threatens and hangs over
three late flourishing Kingdoms, than he who ended his vexatious days at his
own gates, and she which had the Honor of his bed, together with her which was
the mother, and of all the mischiefs which befell all the places wheresoever
she made her abode. But happily you may again reply, that I speak as a loser,
and true, and so may you and one hundred thousand more of poor innocent
sufferers speak in the same sad dialect, as having felt the fearful effects
of the perversity of one man's will, who in the power of a moderate SOVEREIGNTY
and the love of his people, by whom, and by this very Parliament (so hateful
unto him) never any King of England was more honored, beloved, obeyed, and
more courted; and when time was might have been what a just Prince would have
desited; and should I ask you what might he not have been had he either at
first, and long after this Parliament late down, yea and long after the War
began complied with them (as great reason there was he should have done) and
not to have protected Delinquents, neither to have sided with such as most
treacherously deserted their trust, but to have relied (as at first he
promised) on his faithful Council the Parliament, I presume you will
acknowledge it for a manifast truth, that none of his progenitors, were, or
could have been greater it honor, power, wealth, and in reputation at home and
abroad; but the truth was, so powerful a domination his inclinations had over
any other reason than his own, that the ways of the Parliament (though never
so relative to his own honor, justice, profit, and welfare of the Kingdom)
were so averse and contrary to his genius, then rather to be controuled, or
suffer any reformation to have been accomplished by them, either in the Church
or State, and his disordered government to be regulgted by their advice, he
would and did run the hazard of his own ruin, his Posterity and people. And
as already I have showed you, it is a manifest truth that he tacitly had
designed, many years before this Parliament sat down, not only to quit
himself of this Parliament, but of all others, and as power should enable him,
to invade the freedoms and liberties of the English Nation; howsoever in these
particulars (amongst many other of his faults) it is far otherwise attested in
diverse of his expresses, as also protested in his late book (be it his own or
not) the evidence of his own private letters, and the observations on them will
clear that doubt; Where then, I beseech you tell me, should the subject have
had any propriety, which by time and degrees would not have been swallowed up
in that vast gulf of a prerogative royal, where into, not one year before the
Parliament sat down, all that the subject had was in a fair way of ingulfing?
neither wonder at this, for it is an infallible truth, that most Kings affect
their own ends, and injustice, oppression, and commonly tyranny are faculties
inherent to most of them, very seldom to look back to the proper ends for
which they are ordained of God to advance the good and welfare of their
subjects, but generally you shall find them only to seek the improvement of
their own powers, and soveraignties, yea often times without any sensibility
that their people are composed of the same flesh and blood as themselves, to
make havoke of their lives and fortunes, sometimes to maintain their power,
pride, prodigallity, and luxury, and that which is worse, if worse may be, to
fulfill their perverse wills and lustful pleasures in the beggering and
slaughtering of millions of their subjects, for proof whereof, we need not go
far for examples, the endeavors of our own Kings to inslave their subjects,
yields us plenty of presidents, and the French to this day feel the yoke of
slavery imposed on them by Lews the eleventh in taking away their Conventio de
le Estates, and reducing that Government to be at his own disposement; neither
was Ferdinando of Spain quiet in mind, until he had quit himself of the
Justice of Arragon, a Court not unlike the Ephori amonst the Lacedaemonians, or
our Parliaments in England and Scotland, which limited their Kings, and kept
them within the bounds of moderation; the Hollanders also have had lamentable
experience of the Ambition of Philip the second, who on the massacre of 100000
of the Natives endeavored to take away their ancient Immunities, and to
invassalate the whole 17 Provinces under his absolute power; a strange passion
in princes, when no power will content them, but that of absoluteness, to be
masters over their Subjects lives and Fortunes; surely if there be any anallogy
between Shepherds and Kings (as no doubt there is) our blessed Savior tells
us, that bonus pastor ponit vitam pro ovibus, the good Shepherd, or King lays
down his life for his people, and not to expose theirs to fulfill his own
lustful pleasure; a sad and lamentable president whereof, we have all felt in
our late King Charles.

But to proceed, I would fain know, what your aims are, that moves you with
such impetuonsnesse to revile the present Government, since I cannot imagine
what other cause you have, but in your endeavor to bring in the new Crowned
King of Scots on the old score, thereby to re-make your selves in the unmaking
and invassalating the rest of the English Nation, which duly considered as the
posture of affairs with us now are, is so senseless (in reference to the
bettring of the peoples conditions) as that it exceeds all the Chimaera's of
the old Romances, and which you cannot expect may possibly be accomplished
without the effusion of an infinity of more blood, and by the swords of the
Scots and barbarous Irish (excellent cohabitants for the English (if you think
on it) when as you know they are generally hated by both those Nations, though
probable it is, that your imaginations prompt you to believe, that all of your
party shall assuredly rise with them, though in the undoubted fall of the rest
of the Nation; and not unlikely you flatter your selves (out of the old remote
potential hope) with the plunder of London, as the only magazine of wealth,
that will make you all abundantly rich, though in this too you may miss of
your aims, unless at an instant you can change your native dialect, and speak
Scoth Presbytery and Irish Tanestry in a trice, neither ought you to believe
that the Citizens will stand still whilst you cut their throats: But what a
strange piece of poverty possesses your intellectualls, to believe that in such
a change and turn of Fortune (as all of you so much desire) an English man
(howsoever principled) shall long enjoy either life, liberty or estate,
otherwise than at the discretion of the Conqueror; and when the King, either
or both those Nations and other forrainers shall come in upon us and Lord it
over us, in a far higher strain of Tyranny than ever the Danes exercised in
that short time they were here masters over our Ancestors; If you foresee not
this misery, and the fatal consequence which necessarily must follow such a
turn of Fortune, I must leave you to your own will and expectancy, yet must I
not forbear upon these considerations to commend unto your more serious
thoughts, what kind and race of Princes which with such zeal you endeavor to
bring in to govern over the English Nation, where I shall present you with a
very formidable observation, as you may find it in the History of the Scottish
Kings, and it is this, that seven, if not eight of the last Scottish Princes of
the name and family of the Stuarts (one only excepted) came all to their ends
by violent deaths (a fearful fate if you please to observe it) and some of
them to make away one another; as for instance, James the first who for his
Tyrannny was cut off by the Nobility, the second was slain at Roxborough, the
third at Bonoxborn, the fourth at Plowden field, the last three in as needless
quarrels as our late King Charts engaged first against his native Subjects the
Scots, and on the heels of that War against the English and their
Representative, only James the fifth had the fortune to dye of a natural
death, but as to his only Daughter Queen Mary and mother (...) King James the
sixth, it is manifestly known that she caused Henry Lord Darnley her second
Husband to be cruelly murdered, and only to make way to her third Marriage
with Earl Bothwell her Paramour, whom the States banished, and shortly after
called her to account for her Husbands murder, and for that fact and other
conspiracies against the State, by the Votes of the major part of the Peers
and Commons in Parliament she was adjudged to die, whereupon she fled into
England, where contriving sundry plots with the Papists and the Duke of
Norfolk against Queen Elizabeth, and restless in her ambitious contrivements
to dispossess the Queen Regnant of the Crown, you know to what end she came
at Fodringay, where we may safely believe that Gods just judgments overtook
her, when she little dreamed to have dyed at the block; what since became of
her only Son King James, and his two sons Prince Henry and our last King
Charles? though the manner of the two first deaths are still held in dispute,
yet we all know to what a fatal end the last came, even at his own Gates, and
in the same place where the first blood was spilt by his own servants the
Cavaleers; pardon me then, If I present you with an opinion of my own, which I
am confident is an infallible verity, that allmighty God in his justice suffers
not any man to come to a prodigious end but for such sins by him committed,
as are equivalent to that sin for which he suffered; it is Gods own Oracle, an
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, and he that kills by the Sword by the
same weapon or the like he shall surely dye; for a conclusion, take this as a
known truth to all the Nation, that both the late Kings, as they were natural
Scots, very rarely loved an English man, sure we are, not the Nation in
general, and that very seldom either of them admitted any of the English into
their Bed-chambers, (for generally they were all Scots) neither took they any
of the English (Buckingham excepted) into their secrets, and as their
privadoes, until Strafford was taken into our last Kings favor, but no
otherwise than as a mere Statesman and a bold instrument to act any thing
conducible his Masters designs, and such projects which were suitable to his
endeavors and inclinations, otherwise I never knew any that were fit servants
for him; and it is most certain, that both the Father and the Son laid more
subtle and cunning snares to ensnare the English Nation, than all of the
Norman race before them; the Father to have laid the foundation, and the Son
to build up the whole fabric of absolute Sovereignty, as insensibly at first,
and from the beginning of their reigns, as possibly their designs could permit,
but King Charles toward his last, and long before the Wars began, openly, and
shortly thereupon in hostility, and with mortar tempered with more English
blood than ever has been so wilfully and profusely spilt by any one Tyrant in
the World; and for what cause, and on what grounds (I beseech you tell me) more
than for the Nug^ and idle fictions of a divine prerogative, and to rule alone
without other Law than his own Will, and without account to any but to God
alone? they are both the Fathers and the Sons own Maxims, just Tyrant-like,
quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem, and yet, which is the mystery and
the wonder of the times, is this wilful King cried up, by his many partisans,
for the only paragon of Princes, and that which is of more admiration, his
Protestations in the common belief preferred and credited before his visible
actions, and Cabinet Letters, which if men were not besotted, I am sure best of
all other evidences, lays open the most hidden secrets of the heart: But it is
most certain, that before, and a long space after the battle at Edgehill, he
refused all overtures of Peace, though it is confessed he made many motions for
Peace to the Parliament, but ever no other than on such disadvantagious terms
as were utterly unfit for the Parliaments embrasure, and the Kingdomrs
security, for we find them evermore accompanied with such restrictions,
reservations, and ambignous conditions (howsoever gilded over with plausible
pretenses) that the Parliament at length durst not either trust him, or any of
his specious Declarations, as in the observations on the Reliquiae Carolinae
are manifested, for it is most true, that as soon as he had attracted a very
considerable Army to his assistance, by his artifices, and the several visits
and the orations he made to the respective Sheriffs and Gentry (before and
after the setting up of his Standerd) of the Counties of York, Lincoln,
Nottingham, Leicester, Chester, Stafford, Denby, Flint, Salop, Oxford, and
Berks, wherein he neither spared any pains or travel, or lost a minute of time,
both to deceive and win the people to his cause; and it is evident, that he had
not only written his particular Letters to most of the prime Gentlemen of the
Kingdom to side with him, but had sent his peremptory commands to most of the
Colonells of the Parliaments Army sent into Ireland for the assistance of the
distressed Protestants, to repair to his aid against the Parliament, a
treachery and a testimony beyond all others of the falsenesse of his heart,
considered (as hereafter it shall be made more apparent unto you) with the
seeming zeal and care he pretended to bear to those poor Irish Protestants. It
is worth your further observation, that this most unfortunate Prince, having so
often accustomed himself to fraud and dissimulation, that it came at last to
this sad issue, that all his after Messages and Overtures made to the
Parliament (in the declination of his power, and after he was a Prisoner)
though happily more really intended than formerly, and atested with exceeding
specious and plausible Protestations, and some of them confirmed with his
wonted Imprecations, were not believed, but suspected for fallacious; so long
had this most unhappy King (like the Fly that plays with the flame, which
comes in the end to burn himself out of his own fury) such power had his will
and natural inclinations over his reason; where you may take an instance or
two in the way for a proof thereof. When he first raised his Army at York, for
which he endeavors to flam off the Parliament, that those forces were only
raised as a guard for the security of his Person, and to confirm this, he
caused diverse of the Fugitive Lords then attending him, shamefully to attest,
that he had no intent thereby to levy War against the Parliament, when
immediately thereupon he began to march, and to run from place to place as
before is noted, to raise more force, and that which is most perfidious, after
he had erected his Standard at Nottingham he continued the same strain,
utterly denying and protesting that he had not then any manner of intent
thereby to wage war with his Parliament, as hereafter you shall more plainly
see, a strange delusion to flatter himself, in dancing unseen in a net, and
that that he should not only be able to deceive the People by his
Protestations, but to delude and cosen a Court of Parliament out of their
understanding, as you may see this verified in his own Expresses sent to the
Parliament from Nottingham; and what a strange trick would he have put on the
Parliament, when from York he sent them a Message, that he had taken a
resolution to go in person into Ireland to chastise those Rebels, and to that
purpose had determined to raise 2000 Foot, and 200 Horse in and about the
County of Chester for a guard to his person, and to flatter himself with such a
senseless device to delude the Parliament, as if they understood him no better,
than to believe his design to be real, when they perceived his drift was,
First to raise here a considerable force, and then to join with the Irish Army
there, and in the end to turn all his power on the Parliament. It would be too
wearisome to me to recount all the perfidious practices of this most unhappy
Prince, and too tedious to your self to read them, I shall therefore for the
present conclude and refer you to the animadversions and observations on the
contrarity between his public protestations, and private Letters, which you
shall God willing receive very shortly, and wherein I doubt not but that you
will find so much fraud, deceit and dissimulation of this King, as will amaze
you, and turn the strong tide of your belief, (hitherto poisoned with flams and
such subterfuges) as may shame any rational man to be so long cosened and
deluded by them. No more Sir at present but that I desire and wish you to
believe no otherwise of that which I have sent you than in your judgment you
shall find suitable to truth, and that as you shall see just cause, to esteem
me, (as I am) your well wishing friend.

Animadversions or Observations on the strange contrariety between the late
Kings Declarations, Missives, Protestations, Imprecations, sent at several
times to the Parliament, and his Pourtraicture compared with his own Letters
taken at Naseby, and some other of his Expresses not yet taken into public
Observation.
SIR,
I Have now sent you, by your servant, those observations which I promised you,
supposing that they will come to your hands so seasonably, as to help to
convince you, that neither the Parliament began the late wars, or that there
could be any design or plot laid (of I know not how many years standing)
either of a factious party amongst them, to disturb the peace of the Kingdom,
take away the Kings life and his posterity, or to alter the Government, but
that whatsoever has fallen out since the sitting down of this Parliament, has
been enforced by the King himself, and by a concurrency of sundry causes
arising from his own wilful inclinations, the sins of the Nation, and Gods
special hand therein, as a fearful punishment upon us all: If you think
otherwise, and that you shall persist in your errors, I doubt not but these
Observations will more clearly manifest unto you, that the King was (in all
this tragical contest) both his own enemy and no such innocent Martyr as your
party conceives him to have been, and of this let his own actions, and his
private Letters speak, and I shall be silent, whose principal endeavor has
been no other than to give you satisfaction (on your own provocation) and that
truth may appear to all those whom it concerns besides your self, and first to
the

Observations on the Treaties for Peace, after the War began.
The first overture for peace, after the War began, was without all question of
the Parliaments at Colebrook, which how it was accepted of by the King, and on
the nick thereof pursued, by the drawing up of his Army in a mist, the
slaughter at Brayuford best shows out what was the Kings meaning, which how he
labors to defend it in some of his Expresses, yet without doubt if it were not
perfidious, yet very suspicious of no fair meaning; sure it was very retrograde
to the procuring of a peace, otherwise than as himself meant to have it by
force.

The next overture for an accommodation was likewise of the Parliaments first
motion, and agreed upon to be at Oxford, a place as inauspicious for treaties,
as Parliaments; for it came to no other issue than to signify nothing; a game
wherein the King was well versed, a proof whereof amongst many, you may find in
his eighth Letter to the Queen, Jan. 3. 1644. from Oxford viz. The Portugal
Agent has made me two Propositions: First, concerning the reliase of his
Masters brother, for which I shall haeve 50000 l. if I can procure his Liberty
from the King of Spain; the other is for a marriage betwixt my Son Charles, and
his Masters eldest Daughter: for the first, I have freely undertaken to do
what I can, and for the other, I will give such an Answer as shall signify
nothing.

Observation.
Here you may first evidently see what a fine juggler the King was grown, and
into what a straight he had driven himself, to become a broker for money, and
instead of Friendship to a King to whose Agent in others of his Letters to the
Queen, he acknowledges himself to be more beholding for the transport of his
Letters, than to the French Ambassador; and then as to the motion of marriage
to juggle him out with an answer which should signify nothing, judge you
whether it would not have been more Kingly to have dealt more plainly with the
Agent, and to have told him that he liked not the motion, on reasons best known
to himself, than to have flamed him off with a significavit rather of an
affront, than friendship.

The third motion for peace was also of the Parliaments first overture, and
tendered to the King at Oxford, and agreed upon to be at Vxbridge, where how
that likewise was aforehand ordered, and his Commissioners tied up to his will,
and to the wrack of his own Instructions, from which they were not on any
conditions to recede, is made very clear in the Postscript of his Letter to the
Queen, number 5th. January 19. 1644. from Oxford, viz. And be confident that I
will not quit Episcopacy, nor that Sword which God has given into my hands.

Observation.
If the Quaere here should be made whether God had so absolutely given the
power of the Sword, into his hands, as at his own will and pleasure to unsheath
it against his own subjects, and the Representative of the Kingdom, whom by
his Coronation Oath he was obliged to defend and protect, doubtless no man is
so madd to believe, that the Kings resolutions (in using it as he did to their
destruction) were so religiously biased as it became a Christian King: But
that you may further understand, why the King so peremptorily stood to the
upholding of Bishops, and to keep the Militia in his own sole power, (for
that is the meaning of his not quitting the Sword) which all the world knows to
be no otherwise (by the intent of the Laws of the Land, Reason, and the Law of
Nature) an inseparable flower of the Crown than Fiduciary, always in reference
to a trust given our Kings by Parliament, out of confidence that it shall be
used to no other intent or end than the defense of the Kingdom, and not to be
perverted against it, as all the ancient and modern Statutes import, both in
their preambles and texts; Cast your eyes on his own Directions to the Vxbridge
Commissioners number 21. where you may evidently see, that it was not so much
the scruple of his Conscience and Coronation Oath, as in relation to his own
particular designs and interests; viz. That as it is the Kings duty to protect
the Church, so it is the Churches to assist the King in the maintenance of his
Authority; wherefore my Predecessors have been always careful, and especially
since the Reformation, to keep the dependency of the Clergy entirely on the
Crown, without which it will scarsely fit fast on his bead; therefore you must
do nothing to change this necessary dependence.

Observation.
Here you have the true reason wherefore the King so much insisted on the
keeping up of Episcopacy, and how likewise the cunning Gypsies the Bishops had
instilled it into his apprehension, what sure cards they were to keep the Crown
fast on his head, as if the Crown and Myter had been such inseparables, as that
the one could not subsist without the other; observe withal what a queint
Aphorism they first coynd and broched it to King James, viz. no Bishop, no
King; and judge you whether no Porter no King had not been the better maxim,
when as it is perspicuous, that most of our ancient Kings had no such Enemies
as the Bishops, witness Tho. Becket to Henry the second, Lanfranke to Henry
the first, Roger of Salisbury to King Stephen, Orleton to Edward the second,
with diverse others which almost in every Reign opposed their Kings, and addressed
themselves to the Pope for their Palls and Investitures, endeavoring in what
possibly they could to free themselves from any dependancy on the Crown, until
Henry the eighths time, who first of all our Kings freed himself of that
servitude, which had been so fatal to most of his Predecessors. But look a
little further and you shall find in the Kings 19th. Letter to the Queen on
the same subject, Febr. 25. 1645. from Oxford; viz. Thou needs not doubt of the
issue of this Treaty, for my Commissioners are so well chosen (though I say it)
that they will neither be thretned nor disputed from the grounds I have given
them, which upon my word is according to the little Note thou so well
remembers, and to this not only their obedience, but judgments concur; again
in the same Letter, and be confident, that in making peace I shall ever show my
constancy in adhering to Bishops, and all our friends, and shall not forget to
put a short period to this perpetual Parliament; but as thou love me, let
none persuade thee to slacken thine assistance for him who is eternally thine.

Observation.
Here we have a true Character of this unfortunate Kings natural obduracy, and
the averseness of his Genius to alter any of his resolutions, which once fixed,
he would effect on any hazard whatsoever; the Earl of Strafferd, who best of
all others of his arbitrary Ministers had most studied his inclinations, needed
not to have cherished this humor of the Kings, when as in the prosecution of
the wars against the Scots 1639. he counsels the King in Vide the Juncto quinto
Maij 1649
haec verba, Lose all I had, or carry all; again you may here see how he had
aforehand bound up his Commissioners with such instructions from whence they
were not to stir or yield in a jot, as likewise how mindful he was of the
little Note, and punctually to observe it, a very fine note of remembrances I
believe, had we the honor to have seen it; and were we not all of us of the
English Nation, a happy people to see our King governed by the directions and
documents of a woman, a strong Papist, and of the house of Medicis by the
Mother, a most Emperious and dangerous generation of women, and fatal to all
places wheresoever they came? a wife its true she was, but such a one as ruled
and overruled that stiffenesse of his constellation, and effected more with
him than either himself could do, or the most inward of his Council of State
durst attempt, and on one caveat of hers would rather adventure the loss of his
Crown, than not to show his constancy in the upolding of a Myter; you may
remember how much pains he was at with the Divines at Newcastle and the Isle of
Wight, and what tenants he held in his dispute with them concerning Episcopacy,
and that Bishops were of a Divine and Apostolik Institution, which is true in
some sense, as those were which were instituted by the Apostles, but that our
late Bishops as they stood here from before and after King Edwards Reformation,
that they should be taken in with those of St. Paul's making, in the general
notion or latitude of Bishops, without any distinction, as if those Bishops of
the Papisticall Church were of the selfsame nature, and of like ordination as
those of the Primitive times, seems to me a paradox. It Is true, that at the
time of the Reformation the dispute grew high at the Blackfriars amongst the
Commissioners themselves whether Episcopacy should remain as it then stood, or
to reduce it to the original pattern of the primitive Church, as Bishop
Latimer, Martin Bucer, and Peter Martyr would have had it; but Bishop Ridly,
and the rest of the Commissioners, most of them Bishops (as Sir John Heywood in
his first Copy of his The first copy was suppressed and expunged by the Bishops
and the old Knight committed by K. JAMES to the Tower by the instigation of the
Prelates.
History of Edward the sixth lays it down) would by no means assent unto it;
the other three maintaining that Bishops as then they stood were no other than
chips of the papisticall block, and of no affinity with St. Paul's Titmothy's or
Titus Bishops, neither could they be of any conformity with the ancient and
primitive institution, but the mere excrescencies sprouting out of the
exuberancy of the Papacy, long after the defection and adulteration of the
primitive Church, which defection from the ancient purity began immediately
after Gregory the Great, and I am very confident that there are none of our
late Bishops so impudent as to maintain, that either the Britain or Saxon
Kings (whatsoever is fabled of King Lucius) ever erected any Episcopal Sees,
or admitted of any Bishops that came hither before Austin the Monk, and such
others after him, as were merely spriggs of the papacy, and that long after the
adulteration of the Roman Church; a truth so perspicuous, as that I have
wondered on the reading of the discourse between his Majesty and those learned
Divines, why it was not pressed by them, that Episcopacy, quatenus, as it stood
here since and before the Reformation, was spurious, papal, and of no affinity
with the Apostlick, or primitive institution; especially the wonder is so much
the more that the King for the upholding of 26 square caps, should with such
obstinancy (which he would have to be esteemed constancy) oppose a Court of
Parliament composed of 500 Lords and Gentlemen, and pretend so much to honor
and conscience, when as about the same time, and as I remember before that the
dispute was here in the House for the expulsion of the Bishops, the King had
granted the same boon to the Scots. But I beseech you take notice how mindful
the King was to remember his friends, and what were they think you more than
Delinquents, Soldiers of Fortune, and the loosest vermin that the Kingdom could
afford him, together with the Papists, many Country Gentlmen, and the Fugitive
Members of both Houses which he had corrupted and drawn from their trust, with
double ends of his own, not only to make up his mungrell Parliament at Oxford,
but to lame or destroy the legal Parliament at Westminster, whose privileges
with so many protestations he had so often aver'd to maintain? In the next
place please you to observe how memorative the King was to put a short period
to this perpetual Parliament; for this expression manifestly shows how he
intended to deal with all others, a Parliament as himself had made it,
indissolvable (by any other way than that of the The Militia.
Sword, which by no means he meant to depart withal, until needs he must) and
the act assented and granted by himself, on reasons merely relative to the
payment of his own debts, contracted by his unnecessary raising of War against
his Native Subjects the Scots, and for the more speedy discharge of the arrears
due to both armies, which the Parliament was then most willing to defray,
without the least scruple, or upbraiding him with the cause of contracting so
vast a sum, and all to gain at any rate his love and favor; where I must tell
you, that you would have thought it somewhat harsh should they have told him as
it was Sir Rob. Cotton in the life of H. 3.
answered in full Parliament to Hen: the third, that they would not pay his
debts, neither give him a groat, postquam coepit esse dilapidator regni, so
long as he continued to destroy the Kingdom, but you cannot deny how ready they
were to expedite the payments, by taking it up of the City on the public
faith, which the Citizens (on remembrance of the Kings wonted manner of
dissolving of all the Parliaments of his Reign without their due effects)
utterly refused, unless an Act were past for the continuation of the
Parliaments sitting, upon which grounds the King granted that act, which so
nearly concerned his own particular, and the sending home of the Scots, whose
company was then loathsome unto him. How then it comes to pass, that your
self and so many of your party should think this such an act of Grace seems to
me a wonder, when he had so often protested, not only to maintain the
Privileges of Parliament, but whatsoever acts he had formerly assented unto;
but you see here his own expression, That he would not forget to put a short
period to this perpetual Parliament; what then I beseech you do you conceive
would have been the issues? otherwise than to recall all those his so much
magnified acts of grace (as Edward the third yielded him a president) and at
last by the power of the Sword (which he says God had put into his hands) to
have invaded the Laws and universal freedoms of the Nation as his very next
Letter to the Queen manifestly imports March 9. 1645. from Oxford, number the
20th. viz. I have thought of one means more to furnish thee withal for my
assistance, than hitherto thou have had; it it this, that I give thee power to
promise in my name, to whom thou think most fit, that I will take away all
penal Laws against the Roman Catholics in England, as soon as God shall
enable me to do it, so as by their means or in their favors, I may have so
powerful assistance as may deserve so great a favor, and enable me to do it;
but if thou ask what I call that assistance; I answer, that when thou know
what may be done for it, it will be easily seen, if it deserve to be so
esteemed; I need not tell thee what secrecy this business requires; yet this I
will say, that this is the greatest point of confidence I can express to thee,
for it is no thanks to me to trust thee in any thing else, but in this which is
the only thing in difference of opinion betwixt us, and yet I know thou will
make as good a bargain in this, I trusting thee (though it concerns Religion)
as if thou were a Protestant, the visible good of my affairs so much depending
thereon.

Observation.
The Comment on this his Majesty's 20th. Letter, principally relates to these
two most important considerations; first, the invading of the Laws, secondly,
to the affront of the Parliament and the Protestant Religion, when he should be
empowered by the assistance of the Papists, and a third necessarily arises on
the neck of the other two, viz. by giving power to the Queen, a professed
Papist, and an enemy to the English Nation, to manage the business, and to
make the best bargain for him, as she should think most fit, under the seal
of secrecy, as being himself ashamed to be seen in the business, (as God
knows good reason he had) But in the mean time speak your Conscience, where
was then the Kings Conscience, and his honor? and what became of his former
protestations? wherein he so often avows the maintenance of the Protestant
Religion, (without mixtures) and what was his own Religion, more than formal,
or like a nose of wax, convertible only as it should conduce to the visible
good of his affairs? (they are his own words) and what those affairs were
more than his will and pleasure, in his uttermost endeavor to continue to
imbrue the Kingdoms with more blood and rapine, by the swords and assistance
of Papists, cannot well be imagined; these and a world of his other
expressions, compared together with his own Letters, and his Pourtraicture, I
must tell you plainly, have very much troubled my spirits, that he should so
much and so often pretend to Religion, Conscience, and Honor, in yielding up
of Episcopacy, when he made no scruple of Conscience to grant to the Scots the
abolishing of their Episcopacy, which in the Chapter of Church Government in
his Pourtraicture, he strives to salve with an ill savoring plaster, but for
the retention of it in England, he pleads, and stands stiffly on his Coronation
Oath, with the swallowing up of the most essential part thereof, which by far
more obliges the Kings of England to observe, than the preamble to that Oath,
penned of old by the Prelates and Churchmen for their own only ends and
interests, a very inconsiderable party, in respect of the quality of the
Nobility; and Gentry; and that vast number of the Laity, of which it seems the
King reckoned of after the Popes computation, to be extra Caulam, either out of
the Church, or at best but the fag end thereof, and accounts little better of
them, than as so many ciphers, or his slaves at will, at pleasure, clean
forgetting, or slighting the grand and more essential part of his Coronation
Oath, which is confidently averred the late Arch Prelate purposely emasculated,
and never gave it him at his Coronation, but left him at liberty, which all men
knows is that which obliges the King to rule not only by the Laws in being,
but per istas bonas leges quas vulgas eligerit, to govern by such good Laws as
the Parliament shall choose, and the reason of this is most most perspicuous,
for the Laws of England are not of that stamp as those of the Medes and
Persians (unalterable) but changeable according to the vicissitudes of times,
and change of men's manners, and at the Election of the people in their
Representative, the Kings assent being formal, and only a necessary
appendant, and by the intent of the Law, his principal power consists in the
executive part, the Parliaments in the elective; for it is without all question
that never any of our Kings either abrogated or made any Law obligatory to the
people by his only lawful power, but by the Parliaments consent and election;
the nature of the Kings Office being more cumulative then privative, to give
rather than to take any thing from their subjects; but here you may see what a
latitude of power the King assumes to himself, where he promises to the Queen
to take away all the penal laws against Papists, as soon as he shall be enabled
to do it, without a word of by your leave Parliament, so that you may
manifestly see what he intended, and that no other sense than his own is here
pind upon him: you may further observe out of this Letter his windings,
doublings, and fouldings, and how dexterously cunning he was grown, at playing
fast and loose with RELIGION, or with any thing else that might promote his
mischievous designs, leaving no way unattempted though to profaning of
Religion, that he conceived might conduce to the visible good of his affairs
(as that was his usual expression) and what was that visible good think you?
other than to overpower the Parliament, and then to rule as he listed. But to
show unto you what a gamester he was at Hocus-pocus, I pray look upon the
Postcript of his Letter to the Marquess of Ormond February 16. 1648. from
Oxford, viz. In case upon particular men's fancies, the Irish peace should not
be procured, upon powers I have already given you, I have thought good to give
you farther order, (which I hope will prove needless) to seek to renew the
treaty for a peace for a year, for which you shall prowise the Irish (if you
can have it no better cheap) to join with them against the Scots and
Inchiquine, but I hope by that time, my condition may be such, as the Irish may
be glad to accept les, or I be able to grant more.

Observation.
Hence you may make your own judgment what a Proteus the King was grown; you
may take this also into your observation, as suitable to the rest, that in all
his Declarations, Letters, and Messages to the Parliament, and after he had
lost all and could stand up no longer, and was a prisoner, they were then
directed to his two Houses at Westminster, but during his power, and so long as
he had any hopes left him to conquer them, he misses not throughout all his
expresses to call them Rebels, and in that capacity tacitly treats with them
at Vxbridge, (which the Scots at Rippon utterly refused to treat with him
unless he would withdraw and disown his proclamations in stiling them
Traitors) and although he calls them a Parliament, yet was it with a mental
reservation not so to acknowledge them, as you may see in his 17 letter to the
Queen (where it seems she had schoold him to the purpose for acknowledging them
to be a Parliament, for which he makes a very humble and ample apology, and
says, If there had been but two besides my self of my opinion, I had not done
it, and the argument that prevailed with me was, that the calling did no ways
acknowledge them to be a Parliament; upon which condition and construction, I
did it and no otherwise, and accordingly it is registered in the Council books,
and with the Counsels unanimous approbation, but thou will find that it was my
misfortune, not my neglect, that thou have been no sooner advertised of it.

Observation.
I need not comment on these fine pieces of the Kings, your own judgment may
inform you what a quaint Jesuitical jugler he was grown, by the conversation
he had with the Mother and the Daughter, both of them being excellent
proficients in the doctrins of Matchivill; and surely, under the Rose be it
spoken, himself no very bad Scholar in that kind of learning; yet here you may
see what pains he was put unto, how to make a handsome excuse to save himself
from a chiding: but I forbear to make further mention of his perfidious
courses, more than to put you in mind, that so long as his vain imaginations
prompted to overpower the Parliament, and to reduce all to his own absolute
pleasure, its most certain, that he refused ali overtures for agreement with
the Parliament, other than such (as before I have intimated) he verily believed
to make advantage of; and this appears in his 9th. Letter to the Queen, March
thirteenth, from Oxford, viz. Dear Heart, What I told thee the last week
concerning a good parting with our Lords and Commons here, was on Monday last
handsomely performed, and if I now do any thing unhandsome or disadvantagious to
my self or Friends, in order to a Treaty, it will be merely my own fault, for
I confess when I wrote last, I was in fear to have been pressed to make some
mean overtures to renew the Treaty, knowing that there were great labourings to
that purpose; but I now promise thee, if it be renewed (which I believe will
not) without some eminent good success on my side, it shall be to my honor
and advantage, I being now as well freed from the place of base and mutinous
motions (that is to say, of our mungrel Parliament here) as of the chief
causers, for whom I may justly expect to be chidden by thee, for having
suffered thee to be vexed by them.

Observations.
We have here a plain proof of the former assertion, that during the Kings
power, he would entertain no Treaties but such as here he promises the Queen,
should be both to his honor and advantage, and he renders the reason, viz.
That he was then left free to himself to do as he listed, and as his
inclinations should prompt him, as being quit of those base and mutinous
motions of his mungrell Parliament at Oxford; where you may observe, how well
Parliaments suited with the nature of this King; for this at Oxford (which was
of his own design, and calling, of set purpose to annihilate the legal
Parliament at Westminster) was (as himself styles it) a base, mutinous, and
mungrel Parliament, and he might with good reason so account of it, for they
were indeed a sort of perfidious Fugitives, false to themselves and their
Countries, and the King no doubt in his own thoughts esteemed them no other,
for such as would be falls to themselves, the King was not to seek to make his
own judgment what they would be to him, on the turn of any tide of advantage,
but that at Westminster he calls a Rebel Parliament, though of his own first
Summons: The truth was, none would or could please him, neither any council
but such as futed to his own will and pleasure. Its true, and it is confessed
that after he had lost all, and was a prisoner, he seemed more inclinable to
embrace peace, and to that end sent his frequent Messages to the Parliament,
but evermore with the old scruples of his Conscience and Honor, persisting to
his last (as being fed with hopes of the general rising, 1647. and the coming
in of the Scots under Hamilton) to wind himself up again to that power whither
his restless ambition (to be more absolute than he ought to have been) lead
him to the precipice of his own ruin, and it is more than probable, that
during the last Treaty in the Isle of Wight, and the expectation of the
success of that rising to his rescue, he had a perfidious hand therein; for it
cannot be imagined that such an association of English, Scots, and Welsh, would
ever in one conjuncture of time adventure to rise without either his Privity or
Commission; howsoever it is manifestly known, that both the English and Welsh
had for their undertaking the Princes Commission under hand and seal, neither
is it likely that the Prince himself (during a Treaty so near a period to an
atonement) would either authorize that rising, or to have approached at that
very time with his Fleet so near the Thames mouth, without either his Fathers
Commission or approbation, the perfidie showed therein I am more than confident
utterly lost him, and was a principal canse that the Parliament could not in
reason, or with safety of themselves and the King dom, readmit or trust such a
Prince with the government, of whose Reformation they could not but despair.

Observations upon the Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae.
IT is worth his pains who desires to berightly informed of the truth of al
passages and transactions between the late King, and the Parliament, his
mysterious motions, pretenses, and carriages, both during all the wars, and
since his death how matters have been managed by his partakers, especially by
those which first published his Pourtraicture, and him who has taken such
pains in collecting so many of his papers, printing, exposing and dispersing
them throughout all parts of the Kingdom, purposely both to deceive the people,
and maliciously to work upon the facility of their affections in commiseration
of him, and casting an odium on the Parliament; The artifice which this
Impostor uses, is worth consideration, as he has garnished the approaches to
his collections with the Kings picture in some places standing, in others
kneeling, and as it were ejaculating his prayers to God, and those dressed with
sundry devices and motto's, and all this to invite the eye, if not the
understanding of the silly beholder to a belief, that he died an innocent
Martyr, a Prince who suffered for his restless endeavor to desend the
Protestant Religion, the Laws and Libertyes of his Subjects, as he would
intimate by his hudling of the Kings many specious and fraudulent overtures for
peace to the Parliament, and avoiding of future bloodshed. In all the Catalogue
of his one and twenty Messages of the Kings, (besides additionalls) he is
pleased not so much as to insert one of the Parliaments Answers in rejoinder to
any of the Kings Messages, only taking in so many of his Majesty's which he
conceived might serve his turn to clear the Kings innocence, and leaving out
such of the Parliaments most material Missives to which the King omitted to
give any answer at all; as for instance, let him produce what reply the King
made to the Parliaments charge, for Ruperts intercepting of the Clothes,
Provisions horses and other necessaries, sent by the Parliament in the way to
Chester, for the releef of the relicts of the poor Protestants in Ireland, true
it is, that long after an answer was, such as it was, made (though not by him
mentioned) viz. that those provisions might have been better guarded; a proper
answer if you please to take notice of it, when its mostevident, that the Kings
forces not only took them with his express command but drew over the
principal Commanders and Soldiers before sent by the Parliament to his own
assistance against the Parliament, now, that you may see how the active part of
the war was carried on by the King, take into your serious considerations his
Message of the 15 of April, 1642. from Huntington, wherein he earnestly
desires, That the Parliament will use all possible industry in expediting the
business of Ireland, in which they shall find so cheerful a concurrence by
his Majesty, that no inconvenience shall happen to that service by his absence,
he having all that passion for the reducing of that Kingdom which he has
expressed in his former Messages, being unable to manifest more affection to
it, than he has endeavonred to do by those Messages (having likewise done all
such acts as he has been moved unto by his Parliment) therefore if the
misfortunes and calamities of his poor Protestant Subjects there shall grow
upon them (though his Majesty shall be deeply concerned in, and sensible of
their sufferings) he shall wash his hands before all the world from the least
imputation of slacknesse, in that most necessary and pious work.

Observation.
A very pious work indeed, as himself ordered it, if you please to examine it
to the bottom, then make your own judgment, whether it was not the Kings
reach to gull the Parliament, by pressing them to expedite the sending of
Forces to the relief of his poor Subjects of Ireland, and with such words of
pity and expressions of his remorse, how deeply he was concerned therein, and
how sensible of their sufferings and calamities, which might grow upon them,
and just Pilate-like to wash his hands before all the world from the least
imputation of slacknesse in him; when it is manifest his meaning was both to
make use of any such forces as the Parliament should send over, against them,
and consequently to dis-enable them the more in levyes here for their own
defense against him, and his preparations, as it evidently appeared within 3.
months after by the said seizure of the Horses, clothes and provisions sent by
Chester, as also by his remanding over the Regiments sent before into Ireland
to make use of them, as it is visibly known he did, against the Parliament. But
I pray extend your patience, and look farther into this dark work of the
Kings, take a short view of his next Message from Nottingham, where he erected
his Standard, it bears date the 25. of August 1642. Next to this his Message of
the 5th. of Sept. 1642. with another of the 11th. of September following, in
pursuance of the former, peruse them all and you shall evidently see such
notable juglings and Matchivilian dissemblings, as would amaze any Christian
eye to behold them, compared with his actions, his Pourtraicture, and his own
letters taken at Naseby: I shall present them all in their order, verbatim, and
first that of the 25 of August 1642. viz.

We have with unspeakable grief of heart long beheld the distraction of this
our Kingdom, our very soul is full of anguish, until we may find some remedy
to prevent the miseries which are ready to overwhelm this Nation by a Civil
War, and although all our endeavors tending to the composing of those unhappy
differences betwixt us and our two Houses of Parliament (though pursued by us
with all zeal and sincerity) have been hitherto without the success we hoped
for, yet such is our constant and earnest care to preserve the public peace,
that we shall not be discouraged to use any expedient, which by the blessing of
the God of Mercy, may lay a happy foundation of peace and happiness to all our
good subjects. To this end, observing that many mistakes have arisen, by the
Messages, Petitions, and Answers betwixt us and our two Houses of Parliament,
which happily may be prevented by some other way of treaty, wherein the matter
in difference may be more clearly understood, and more freely transacted, we
have thought fit to propound to you, that some fit persons may be by you
enabled, to treat with the like number to be authorized by us, in such a manner
and freedom of debate, as may best tend to that happy conclusion which all good
men desire (the peace of the Kingdom,) wherein as we promise in the word of a
King, all safety and encouragement to such as shall be sent unto us, if you
shall choose the place where we are for the Treaty; which we wholly leave to
you, presuming on the like care of the safety of those we shall employ, if you
shall name another place: So we assure you, and all our good Subjects, that to
the best of our understanding, nothing shall therein be wanting on our part,
which may advance the true Protestant Religion, opPose Popery and Superstition,
secure the Law of the Land (upon which is built as well our just Prerogative,
as the propriety and liberty of the Subject) confirm all just power and
Privileges of Parliament, and render us and our people truly happy, by a good
understanding betwixt us and our two Houses of Parliament: Bring with you as
firm resolutions to do your duty, and let our People join with us in our
prayers to Almighty God for his blessing upon this work; If this Proposition
shall be rejected by you, we have done our duty so amply, that God will absolve
us from the guilt of that blood which must be spilt, and whatsoever opinion
other men may have of our power, we assure you nothing but our Christian and
pious care to prevent the effusion of blood, has begotten this motion, our
provision of men, money and arms being such as may secure us from further
violence, til it please GOD to open the eyes of our People.

Not to trouble you with further search, I shall present you that Message of
the 5th. of September 1642. in pursuance of the former, together with that of
the 11th. of the same Month, tending all to the same purpose, though the
Observations on them you shall find handled separatim, and left to your more
mature consideration.

We will not repeat what means we have used to prevent the dangerous and
distracted estate of the Kingdom, nor how these means have been interpreted,
because being desirous to avoid effusion of Blood, we aere willing to decline
all memory if former bitterness, that might make our offer of a Treaty readly
accepted: We did never declare, nor ever intended to declare both our Houses of
Parliament Traitors, or set up our Standard against them, and much less to put
them and this Kingdom out of our protection, we utterly profess against it,
before God and the World; and farther to remove all possible scruples which may
hinder the Treaty so much desired of us, we hereby promise, so that a day be
appointed by you, for the unvoting of your Declarations against all persons as
Traitors, or otherwise for assisting of us, we shall with all cheerfulness
upon the same day recall our Proclamations and Declarations, and take down our
Standard, in which Treaty we shall be ready to grant any thing that shall be
really for the good of our Subjects, conjuring you to consider the bleeding
condition of Ireland, and the dangerous condition of England, in as high a
degree, as by these our offers we have declared our self to do, and assuring
you that our chief desire in this world is to beget a good understanding, and
mutual confidence, betwixt us and our two Houses of Parliament.

Sebtemb. 5. 1642.

Who have taken most ways used most endeavors, and made most real expressions
to prevent the present distractions and dangers, let all the world judge, as
well by former passages, as our two last Messages, which have been so
fruitless, that (though we have descended to desire and press it) not so
much as a Treaty can be obtained, unles we would denude our self of all force
to defend us from a visible strength marching against us, and admit those
persons accounted Traitors to us, who according to their duty, their Oaths of
Allegiance, and the Law, have appeared in defense of us their King and liege
Lord (whom we are bound in Conscience and Honor to preserve) though we
disclaimed all our Proclamations and Declarations, and erecting of our
Standard, as against our Parliament; all we have left in our power is to
express the deep sense we have of the public misery of this Kingdom, in which
is involved that of our distressed Protestants of Ireland, and to apply our
self to our necessary defense; wherein we wholly rely on the providence of God,
the Justice of our cause, and the Affection of our good people, so far we are
from putting them out of our protection; when you shall desire a Treaty of us,
we shall piously remember whose blood is to be spilt in this Quarrel, and
cheerfully embrace it; and as no other reasons induced us to leave our City of
London, but that with honor and safety we could not stay there, nor to raise
any force, but for the necessary defense of our Person and the Law, against
Levies in opposition to both, so we shall suddenly return to the one, and
disband the other, as soon as those causes shall be removed: the God of Heaven
direct you, and in mercy divert those judgments, which hang over the Nation,
and deal so with us, and our posterity, as we desire the preservation and
advancement of the true Pretestant Religion, the Law, and the Liberty of the
Subject, the just rights of Parliament, and the peace of the Kingdom.

Sept. 11. 1642.

Observations on the former three Messages of the Kings.
In these three Messages we have as specious and pious expressions (in show) as
possibly can be expected from a King that meant really as he writ, and said as
he thought: But on a due consideration of all passages, and the subject matter
in them contained, and as the case then stood betwixt him and the Parliament,
with as much subtilty, craft and cunning, as can well be devised by the
subtilest Disciple of Machavill.

I shall take the; liberty to comment, and prove the assertion, out of the
first of these Messages of the 25 of August 1642. and so in order to the rest,
as they visibly show out unto any rational man their purport, without drawing
other Conclusions than necessarily arise out of the expressions themselves,
compared with the Kings other Declarations, his actions, and his own private
Letters.

First he tells the Parliament, With what unspeakeable grief of heart he beheld
the distractions of the Kingdom, until he could find out a remedy to prevent
the miseries which were ready to hang over the whole Nation by a civil War.
Where I pray tell me, who first gave the occasion, who raised those
distractions, or made the first preparations to a civil war, other than
himself? Next he speaks of differences betwixt him and the Parliament, which
he confesses to have arisen through mistakes of the Messages, Petitions and
Answers, betwixt him and his two Houses of Parliament, which he would have
prevented by a Treaty, wherein the matters in difference might, be more clearly
understood, and more freely transacted; And could there have been a more fitter
place to debate them with honor and freedom, than in the Parliament? whither
with welcome he might have come without the least danger to his person, and
whither he was so often and humbly invited to come, on no other conditions, but
to make him great and glorious, and leaving Delinquents, which he protected
against Law and Reason, to the discretion of the great Judicature of the
Nation, which would have been both a safe, a profitable, and a short course for
him to have yielded unto, and saved him the labor of a dishonorable
descending out of his dyning room, to dispute those differences with the States
of the Kingdom in the Kitchen, and without so many impertinencies, ambages,
and subterfuges wherewith he solaces himself seemingly moving for authorizing
of fit persons on both sides to debate the matter with freedom; a very fine
way indeed, and about the wood, when he might have sat still in peace and
quietness, and left the obliquities of the Church and State to those to whom
they properly belonged to be disputed, regulated, and set straight; whilst
himself (without such an unnecessary and un-Kingly engagement) might have taken
his pleasure in hunting the Buck, rather than to have needlessly all that Summer
traversed his ground, through so many Counties, in hunting after men to kill
the best and most faithful of his Subjects (could he have had the grace to
have seen it) of his whole Kingdom. But then he comes to an other overture,
that if on securing of such Treators as himself should choose, and the like
safety by him given to such as the Parliament shall design for a Treaty, then
there shall be nothing wanting on his part, to the advance of the true
Protestant Religion, the Laws, the Liberty of the Subject, and just Priviges
of Parliament; as to Religion, can any man believe that knew how he was
principled, that he would have yielded to other than that formal and
prelaticall Protestantisme which he had vowed to uphold? As to the Laws, should
they have been other than should still have lain under his negative power? As
to the Libertyes of the Subject, what should they have been, more than the
Militia his Sword then drawn against them would permit as he pleased to like or
dislike? As to the Privileges of Parliaments, which he takes care to confine
with his Epithet (Just) in the promse he makes, what should they have been,
but as they might suite to the best advantage of the Crown, and his unlimitable
Prerogative? then he concludes, that if that Proposition be rejected, he
appeals to God and the World, that he had don his duty, which would absolve him
from the guilt of that blood which he says must be spilt; and I believe him,
for it seems he meant then to spill blood (as he did afterward, more than
befitted a Christian King) rather than to have mist of the accomplishment of
any of his resolutions, having ingraved on his Sword, aut Caesar, aut nullus,
Caesar, or no body, to one of which he attained; his close seems to me both
monitory and minitory, for he gives the Parliament to understand, how he was
provided and what they were to trust to, in telling them aforehand, That
whatsover opinion other men have of our power, our provision of men, money and
arm, are such, as may secure us from further violence, till it shall please God
to open the eyes of our people; a very brave invitation to peace, with the
Sword in his hand, to enforce it, as he pleased to have it, and with an Army of
6000 Horse, and 11000 Foot (as elsewhere he says he had ready to chastise the
Rebels;) But look over to his Chapter, upon seizing of the Forts. Castles, Navy
and the Militia, there he disclaimes to have had any other arms than those of
the Primitive Christians (prayers and tears) against their Persecutors, where
he is pleased (in a strange contradiction) to make that an Argument of his not
raising the first War against the Parliament, though as it is well known at
Edgehill he came with 20000 well armed men into the field, with a full
resolution to beat the Parliament to fitters; how you will piece these
contradictions together, I leave as a task to you, it being beyond my power to
reconcile such distant Asseverations.

Now to his Message of the 5th of Sept. in pursuance of the former, he says,
That he never did, or ever intended to declare both our Houses of Parliament
Traitors, or to set up our Standard against them, and yet at that instant had
proclaimed my Lord of Essex, the Earl of Stamford, and all their Adherents
Traitors which necessarily must be intended the Parliament, for they
Commissioned Essex, and raised their defensive Army, which he fought with at
Edgehill, and all along the competition styles them Rebels; such wide and bold
contradictions, that no man knows where to him; which puts me in mind what some
of his own domestic servants have often averred, that they could not depend on
any of his promises, or believe what he said, and sure I am, and enough there
are of no mean rank and quality of his servants yet living, and in beggary;
can witness, and have sad cause to remember, that his Letters Patents full
dearly paid for and under his Broad seal, could not protect any of them from
resuming into his own hands, that he had a mind to, either to make use of them
to his own advantage, or to confer them on others, as he was pleased, without
other satisfaction, but with fruitless promises, that they should be
considered. Next he goes on and says, that on the Parliaments revocation of
their Declarations, as Traitors, or otherwise for assisting of us, we will
with cheerfullnesse upon the same day, recall our Proclamations, and take down
our Standart; but note then, it necessarily follows, that it could not be
erected but only against the Parliament, unless his meaning was to erect it
against the Man in the Moon; but here you have the kernel of that nut, which
stuck so fast in the Kings stomach; and was it not a very fine and equal
proposition, to put the innocent and the nocent into the balance, the just
with the unjust, and either to make War, or free so many and heinous
Delinquents that resorted unto him, together with those false and fugitive
Lords and Commons, trusted by their Countries, which by the laws of the Land
ought not to have departed without leave of the Speaker, and that on urgent
occasion? Bethink your self whether this Proposition suited either with Reason,
Honor, Conscience, and the ancient usage and Presidents of Parliaments, or
with the Kings Justice, to become the skreen to Delinquents of so high a
strain: but to the close of this Message, where he conjures the Parliament
again to consider the bleeding condition of Ireland, and the dangerous
condition of England, when as none but himself was guilty of that Phlebotomy,
and he alone that first set them, and kept them a bleeding, so long, as that to
stanch the vein, the State could not devise a better cure, than to let out his
blood, which had let out so much throughout; the three Kingdoms, as would have
dyed the vast Ocean into crimson.

But briefly to his next Message of the 11th of Sept. 1642. where all the world
may see where the Remora lay that staid him from coming to the Parliament,
until he had provided for the indemnity of all those persons, etc. which he
says were accounted Traitors to us, who according to their duty, their Oaths
of Allegiance, and the Law, have appeared in defense of us their King and Liege
Lord (whom we are bound in Conscience and Honor to preserve.) So that it here
appears plainly, that no other obstacles then stood in the way of his return
to the Parliament, but the absolute Indemnity of all that had appeared in his
defense, according to their duty, oaths, and Law, as he would have it believed;
his pretended fear of Tumults are not here in question, neither any other
material exception, but the indemnity of his Partisans, a goodly Honor and
Conscience) could he have brought so great a party with Indemnity into London
and to the Parliament, it seems then he doubted not but to make his party good
with, or without fighting, and what between their own power, and his fraud,
its plain that he thought in time he should be enabled to overpower the
Parliament, and to carry all other things answerable to his will and hearts
desire; but by what law could those fugitive Members depart the House, and fly
to him? and by what Law could he protect them which had falsified their Trust?
was it their duty to run to him at a call, who before against his duty and his
Oath ran from the Parliament, under subterfuges, and pretense of Tumults, and
upon no other ground, but by his absence and noncurrence (as he was made to
believe) to make the Parliament no more than a cipher and that then they
neither could or durst act in a doyt without him? but having by this time seen
his own error, and that the Parliament would and did transact without him, and
that in want of his concurrence the people concurred with them in the defense
of the public liberty; he then insists on no other scruple than Indemnity for
all his party; and here we come to a pure piece of Nonsense, where he says,
No other reason induced us to leave our City of London, but that with Honor
and Safety we could not stay there, nor to raise any force, but for the
necessary defense of our-person, and the Law, against levies in opposition to
both: As to his leaving of the City, and the Parliament, that pretense is
clearly evinc't, by his own former overture of coming to them on condition of
the Parliaments withdrawing their Proclamations, against the Delinquents, and
fugitive Members, but as to his raising of force for the necessary defense of
his person and the Law, both the reason (if there be any) and coherence are at
so wide and wild a distance, as that I believe the quaintest of his
Secretaryes, or him that writ it, on a review of the Incongruity, would be
ashamed to own his own work; and observe it for a known truth to all the
Kingdom, did not he first raise a party of Cavaliers to assault the House, to
beat and kill the poor petitioning people, before ever the Parliament had so
much as a thought of raising one man, when himself was provided with 300
desperate Ruffians, fit and ready to attempt any bold Assassination? and what
one man before himself began had offended him, that he of necessity must raise
a force to defend his person and the Law? was it Law, when as at London he
found himself deceived to raise a strength sufficient to quash the Parliament,
and against the Legislative power it self, but he must run into the North, and
round about half of his Kingdom to do it, and missing his ayms, to come at last
and so often with flam's and overtures for a Treaty, which he never really
meant, or intended, otherwise than in subtilty and his wonted fetches to decoy
the Parliament and people into a belief of his deep sense of the bleeding
condition of the Kingdoms, of which no Prince Christian could be more
careless, as it evidently appears by all his actions, examined in the right
sense of his own meaning, as anon shall be manifestly demonstrated out of his
own refusal of the Parliaments petitions? As to the Levyes made by the
Parliament in opposition to him and the Laws, he might have remembered, that
none made Levies either against him or the Law, more than his own lawless
Will, and that the Parliament made no sooner Levies than it became them, to
oppose his Levies, raised against them and the known Laws of the Land; and that
notwithstanding all those specious and umbragious Messages sent to the
Parliament for Peace and Accommodation, tending to no other end than to rock
the Parliament asleep, and by his then frequent placentias to lull them into a
slack and negligent remissnes, in raising defensive arms against his Forces,
whilst himself by protracting of time, might attract such an Army as would
enable him to overpower both the Parliament, and whatsoever Forces were (as he
says) then in their march against him, which he had no sooner drawn together,
but out of his confidence to have beaten the Parliaments Army to pieces; not
eight days before Edgehill fight he not only utterly refused their Petion,
which would have been presented to him by the mediation of the Earl of Dorset,
(for he had a good space before refused all accommodation,) but sent Rupert to
the Commissary General (who was to deliver it) to tell the Earl of Essex, then
at Worcester, that he would not receive any more Petitions from him or any of
the Parliament Rebels of them all: A known truth to many yet living, and some
of them sitting at present in Parliament, whereby it manifestly appears, that
all his former and many Missives, under the umbrage of Peace, were mere
dalliances, both to mock the Parliament, and to cosen the people into a belief
of his reality and good meaning, when he meant nothing more than to bob the
Parliament by cunning and secret fraud, until he might ruin them by plain
and open force, and then to pursue those naturalized appetites, and arbitrary
designs of his, which so long before he had cherished in his heart, which
neither his Honor, Reason, and his Conscience, (whereof so often he talks)
could prevail with him to disgorge, until their over-growth enforced him to an
untimely vomit.

It Is most true, that they which look on the first face of things, and heed
only the outside of objects, without an intentive eye on their in-sides, are
easily deceived; but such as will narrowly look into all his Expresses,
compared with his deeds, shall doutlesse soon find, that this unhappy King was
one of the deepest and boldest dissemblers, of any one Prince which the last
Century has produced; and I am prone to believe, that he took too much of the
pattern of Lews th'eleventh of France, who was wont to say, that he desired to
leave his Son no other Learning, than Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare,
he that knows not to dissemble, knows not how to play the King; and it has
been feared, and by those which wished him well, that he was too much verst in
the principles of Machiavill, having in his life time practiced, and since his
death left behind him so many eevidences thereof, that many of the best heads
have been induced to beleve, that he came not behind any of the ITALIAN
Politicians of this age.

But to take all these his three Messages together, considered by any discreet
man, as their purport tends to one and the selfsame end, and the time when
they were sent to the parliament, all of them, whilst he was most busy and
sedulously studious, how and where to raise Forces both at home and abroad, and
it evidently shows, that his intent in all his specious overtures of peace,
were to no other end, than to befool the People and Parliament, which he then
began to know would not be cosened, as having had sufficient experience of him;
practice indeed he might (as he failed not) to continue to delude the vulgar
belief, and to keep in with the people; but he then found there was no good to
be done on a Court of Parliament, for he perceived they meant not further to
trust him, than they saw him; and to have yielded to a treaty circumscribed
with such large conditions, and so unequally balanced, as so admit of such as
he should send to treat with them, out of Parliament, which not unlikely would
have been of those that had both deserted the Parliament and falsified their
faith, which to have indempnified, and all other Delinquents as had repaired
unto his assistance, (otherwise no peace with him) what effects could a Treaty
produce, (so much upbraided (by his party) on the Parliament for refusing it)
other than mockery? when himself knew, as well as themselves, that they would
not yield unto such a motion, neither himself go less than to take off all
the Delinquents with impunity against all reason, law, and the ancient
president, of all former Parliaments; that alone being the greatest breach of
privilege that ever was offered to a Court of Parliament, and such a
destructive project to the essence and being of Parliaments, as in the future
took away all power and privilege from them, and necessarily conferred it on
his own usurped Prerogative, his negative claim being no more, and scarce so
much to enable him to do in the future as he listed, when as every vulgar
spirit knows it for Law, that the King cannot, neither ever durst any of our
Kings, rescue one Prisoner at the Bar, out of the hands of Justice, in any of
the inferior Courts of the Kingdom, ('It Is true, that Henry of Monmouth being
a rude Prince, though after a tolerable King, came openly and with violence to
the Kings Bench in Westminster Hall, and rescued Poynes his Servant, arraigned
(for robbing and taking away the Kings Treasure) at the Bar; but the story
tells us, that the Judges laid the Prince by the heels for his pains, and his
Father the King thankt them for it.) much less then that this King should
presume to rescue so many viperous Delinquents out of the justice of the great
Judicature of the Nation, which all of common reading know have acted sundry
times in such a power, as to depose several of his Ancestors for their
Tyrannies, and hanged many of their chief Instruments: Presidents which with
good reason he might have more timely remembered, and not have stood with his
Sword in his hand to enforce so unjust, senseless and unreasonable a
Proposition for a Treaty.

Observations on the Kings Pourtracture.
THe Kings Book, which has flown abroad, and throughout the Kingdom, as it
were between the wings of Mercury, and has so much taken in the opinion of the
vulgar belief, and esteemed to be such an impregnable rampire, incirculating
his innocence, that it has been thought not assaultable; I confess at the
first sight thereof it took for a while, as his protestations formerly had
done, in many apprehensions; but on a second consideration of the title (The
Kings Image) with the dress that is bestowed upon his Effigies in a posture of
devotion, in imitation of David in his ejaculations to Heaven, surely I could
not believe that such a piece of vanity was of the Kings designment, but the
mere juggling devise of some hypocritical or Mohammedan Impostor, the better to
stir up the People and vain beholders to pity him: But entering into the Body
of the Book, and considering the choice of the many Subjects whereof it treats,
the whole contexture whereof has already been sufficiently handled without
mittens by a Gentleman of such abilities as gives place to none for his
integrity, learning and judgment; yet on re-consideration of the whole (amongst
others of his Chapters) coming to that of (listing of Armies) and in that to
his Interrogations, Whose innocent blood has he shed? what Widows or Orphants
tears can witness against me? Doubtless were there no other evidence
throughout all the whole book (as God knows every page yields plenty of such
impudencies) those two Interrogatories would be sufficient to prove him one of
the bloudiest out-facers of truth that ever was known in the world. Passing by
his own acknowledgment, that himhimselfe first began the late War, and
consequently guilty of all the innocent blood spilt throughout the three
Kingdoms, it would not be amiss to retort his own Interrogatories, and to
ask wether there be any one Family or Kindred throughout three Kingdoms, that
yields not a Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, or a Kinsman, whose tears have
not cried to Heaven for the infinity of blood spilt through his wilfulness,
or for the wounds, or loss of Limbs of so many throughout the Land we which
see daily haulting and crutching it in hospitalls, and in every of our streets;
and has there been no Widows or Orphans tears shed? or no complaints made to
himself for the goods taken violently from them, and fireing of numberless
habitations by his own merciless Soldiers, Commissioned by himself, yea
commanded to be put in execution, as it may be instanced in thousands of sad
examples, yea by poor Widows crying and kneeling unto him for the rapines
committed either in his own sight, or by his permission, when they received no
other answer, but his turning about from their lamentations, and saying that he
did it not, when it lay in his power, and by his oath and duty he stood bound
to see it redrest, which he never was known to have done, but to slight
whatsoever complaints were addressed unto him of that nature? And was he ever
known to spare either friend or foe, where money was to be had to prosecute
his perfidious and bloody designs, which he took not? Amongst thousands of
presidents of this nature, did he spare Mr. Ascham, a known Royalist, and one
that assisted him in his bloody Wars, when he sent Rupert, that plundering
kinsman of his, to rifle the Gentleman's house at Layford in the County of
Berks, who took from him ten thousand pounds at once in ready money, and out of
his bounty (whereof he was very seldom known to be over liberal) sent back
the tenths thereof as a divident between his two unmarried daughters, and that
also on great suit made unto him, and the tears of the Gentlewomen themselves
that he would be pleased to consider their distressed condition? with what face
could he so much as pretend to innocence, or appeal to the witness of any
Widows or Orphans tears, when it is openly known, that he never spared any man's
blood in his wrath, who was in arms against him, otherwise than for his own
ends, and safety of such of his own side as the Parliament had in their
custody? when he had granted out Commissions of Oyer and Determiner to his
chief Justice Heath and others to hang all such as had opposed his Tyranny in
taking the Parliaments part, until he was induced to retract those Commissions
in regard that two for one of his own might happily by his own President have
gone to the Gallows? and do not his own Letters to the Queen confirm his
resolution to take money wheresoever he could find it, when he tells her that
his only want was money, which good Swords and Pistolls would fetch in? and has
not the practice of all his barbarous Wars verified as much as he therein
sooths up himself, to be supplied either by hook or crook? If no innocent
blood can be found to witness against him, let the ghosts of 200000 poor
Innocent souls, barbarously butchered in Ireland speak; if no Widows or
Orphans tears can witness against him, let the dum stones of those demolished
palaces of Rasing, Ragland, Belvoyer, and infinite others speak, where those
formidable garrisons of his were made to the terror and damage of all men in
their vicinity, and whose reducing cost so much innocent blood. Neither let
those great Lords and prime Gentlemen of this Kingdom, whose Lands and total
Inheritances are lately voted to be sold, in reparation of the public losses,
and in defense of the general interest of the Commonwealth (changed) when it
could not otherwise subsist, but by rooting up his tyrannous monarchy be
silent; And if no other tears of Widows and orphans can be found to accuse
him, let his ambition, injustice, oppression, rapine, and bloodshed speak, let
that vast number of Gentlemen which have made their compositions (for syding
with him in his unjust and destructive Wars at Goldsmiths hall, speak of be
silent, whose Wives and Children, live in want, and happily not without tears
enough for the indigence whereunto they are reduced through his only means.

Now if all these sad instances be the effects and Trophies of his seventeene
years reign, which he boasts that the people enjoyed in such measure of peace,
justice and plenty, as all the neighbor Nations have either admired or envied;
and if this his Pourtracture and Image be that monument which his friends,
since his death, or rather before, had prepared in readiness, and stolen the
pattern from Mecha, and to hang it in that his ayrery Mohammedan regality,
supported by this their impostured Loadstone, whereby to present his sacred
memory, in his Solitudes, to posterity, surely it may be suspected, they were
not so exactly their Crafts-masters, or so much his friends as foes, to Saint
him before his time, and in such a shrine, as necessarily must render him to
future times (infamous) an imparralelld dissembler, and a greater deceiver than
Mahomet ever was, and of the number of those of whom the Prophet David makes
mention, which speak peace to their Neighbors, when mischief was in their
hearts, (as all the Psalm. 28
world knows he has too often practiced to his people and Parliaments) when as
it would have much better became him to have left out his many Pharasicall
justifications, and to have remembered, that he which covers his sins shall
not prosper, but who so confesses Proverbs 28. 13.
and forsakes them shall have mercy; this had been the better way to have
invited others to have spoken less and more favorable of him, than now in
conscience they ought, having such an artificial and faced piece of impudent
justifications, exposed and set forth purposely to deceive the poor people,
and to affront truth, and the evident managery of his bloody and licentious
reign, which necessarily to the Worlds end will give an occasion to rippe up
his life, and show to the present and after ages, what a Tomb these juggling
imposters have erected for him; and with what Epitaphes of impiety, injustice,
blood and rapine, it will be adorned, instead of that glory wherewith they
intended to perpetuate to his memory; though sufficient and enough has already
been written, in discovery of this grand Imposture, and to every piece and
parcel thereof so much answered as may satisfy all men in their right wits;
as to others that are out of them, and have a desire to be cosened out of their
understandings, I think an Asian belief would better fit them than an European
Faith, a gallymaufried Alcoran, rather than a true and rational Remonstrance,
dressed with no other Rethorick than the naked truth; and shall men be silent
when they see it overborne with the multitudinous denyalls, flams, and
falsehoods of his defeated and malicious parties?

Observations on the Kings going into the Scotch Army.
THe Kings disguized going from Oxford into the Scotch Army then at Newark, as
it was one of his last shifts, so was it a very shrewd one (considered as he
had laid the design) That he went first to them was doubtless more out of an
apprehension and confidence he had to gain them to his assistance, than out of
any great good will he bore toward them, but sure it was out of an inveterate
hatred he bare toward the Parliament, the evidence of this truth manifestly
appears by the Kings Letter to Ormond, Number 27. from Oxford, April the 3d.
1646. I shall present you with the principal part thereof, at your own leisure
you may peruse the whole, viz.

Having lately received very good security, that we and all that do adhere to
us, shall be safe in their Persons, Honors and Consciences in the Scotch Army,
and that they shall really and effectually join with us, and with such as will
come unto us, and join with them, for our preservation, and shall employ their
Army and Forces to assist us to the procuring of a happy and well-grounded
Peace for the good of us and our Kingdoms in the recovery of our just Right, we
have resolved to put our selves to the hazard of passing into the Scotch Army
now lying before Newarke, and if it shall please God that we come safe thither,
we are resolved to use our best endeavor with their assistance, and with the
conjunction of the Forces under the Marquess of Montrosse, and such of our
well affected Subjects of England as shall rise for us, to procure it may be an
honorable and speedy Peace with those who hither to refused to give ear to any
means tending thereunto; of which our resolution, we hold it necessary to give
you this advertisement, as well to satisfy you, and all our Council and
loyal Subjects with you, and to whom we will that you communicate these our
Letters; yet failing in our earnest and sincere endeavors by a Treaty to put
an end to the miseries of these our Kingdoms, we esteemed our self obliged, to
leave no probable expedient unattempted to preserve our Crown and Friends from
the Usurpation and Tyranny of those, whose actions declare so manifestly their
designs to overthrow the Laws and happy established Government of this
Kingdom; And now we have made known to you our resolution, we recommend to
your special care the disposing and managing our affairs on that side, as that
you shall conceive most for our Honor and Service, being confident the course
we have taken (though with some hazard to our person) will have a good
influence on that our Kingdom, and defer, if not altogether prevent, the
Rebels transporting of Forces from them into that Kingdom; And we desire you to
satisfy all our well-affected Subjects on that side, of our Princely care of
them, whereof they shall receive the effect, as soon as God shall enable us.

Observations.
We have here a most quaine piece of Machiavilisme, molded under the Kings
wonted and specious pretenses of the care he had for the good of his Subjects,
in procuring an honorable peace, and for recovery of his just Rights from
those (as he says) which hitherto refused to give way to any means tending
thereunto: But observe how he intended to accomplish this peace, and to put an
end to the miseries of the Kingdom, and you shall evidently see, that it was
out of an assurance he had to win the Scots to side with him in a new War, and
in causing them to break their Faith plighted to the Parliament, when at that
very time they were to receive 300000 l. toward their entertainment; this
being but a piece of his design, for to that assistance he flattered himself to
receive from the Scots, he also builds on that merciless Army under Montrosse,
and such of his well-affected Subjects of the English as shall rise for us,
(they are his own words) Speak your Conscience, was not this a fine plot think
you, to procure an honorable and speedy peace, when his ends were as visible
as the Sun shine to continue the War, and to pollute the Land with more blood
under his wonted umbragious pretenses of peace, and (as he says) to recover his
just rights? and what were those rights, more than by a new Stratagem to
overmaster all under his power? or at least to enforce such a peace, as might
suite to his own desires? then he comes to say that he has left no means
unattempted, and I believe it in his own sense, and that was in the conjunction
of both those Armies, and his inviting of all his well-affected Subjects in
England to rise for us; and in pursuance of this deep plot he commands Ormond
to communicate his Letters to the Council there, and to all his Well-affected
Subjects of Ireland, that they might know how carefully he was of them, by the
confidence he had in that course, and what a good Influence it would have on
that Kingdom, viz. in the deferring, if not to the utter disappointing of the
Rebels transporting of supplies to the relief of the distressed poor
Protestants of Ireland, and desites that all his Well-affected Subjects there
should take notice of his Princely care of them, whereof they should receive
the effects so soon as God should enable him; a very Princely care indeed if
you mark it: but you may here see that God would not be mocked, neither enable
him in his mischievous projects. Speak freely, whether this King meant well, or
acted like a Christian in his treacherous endeavor to divert in what possibly
he could devise the Parliaments Forces, sent for the assistance of their poor
Brethren of Ireland, when as he had so often protested, and born the Parliament
in hand how desirous and careful he was to expedite their supplies thither,
and by an Act of his own Assent had empowered the Parliament therewith, which
here again (in his wonted language) he calls Rebels, to speed their recruits
against those which he then styles his Well-affected Subjects. On the
consideration of the premises, I pray tell me, where is that Sophister to be
found, that can handsomely make an Apology for such foul dissimulations? If you
cannot find any, I will point you to himself, as you may see it in his
Pourtraicture, Cap. XXII. on his going into the Scotch Army, where he says,
That what Providence denies to force, it may grant to prudence; necessity is
now my chiefest Counselor, and commands me to study my safety by a disguized
withdrawing from my chiefest strength, and adventuring on their Loyalty which
first began my troubles.

Here you have an Apology of his own, though surely it is a very poor one;
where first I pray make your own judgment, whether the Scots began his
troubles, or he theirs? if you doubt on it, Straffords, and the late Arch
Bishops Ghosts will witness, that he would not suffer them to be at quiet; But
what prudence was that when he could no longer stand up to infest three
Kingdoms at once, then to put himself on the precipice of necessity, and for
his safety to go into the Scotch Army? and why not first into his Throne in
the Parliament House at Westminster? from whence he fled, as from a Serpent,
and by a thousand most humble Petitions, and motions, was invited to return
with welcome, until he had wilfully and most perversely made himself incapable
of acceptance, and so imbrued himself and the three Kingdoms with the loathsome
leprosy of Innocent blood, that with Vzziah he had made himself more fit for
a Cloister, than a Palace. I pray speak your own judgment, whether this his
prudence was any other than an indefatigable pursuance to fulfill his own will,
in re-involving the Kingdoms in a more direful War, than he had done before?
and could Providence do less than to deny him safety? when all his studies
were devoted to find out any means to disturb the Kingdoms peace and safety,
and to destroy Parliaments, whereby to make himself an absolute Monarch, and of
a King of Gentlemen and Freemen, to become a Tyrant over so many inanimated
Slaves; you may without injustiee avouch it, that none of his courses were like
to thrive, when they were continually known to be accompanied with a spirit of
error, and that the effects and ends of studying his own safety chiefly
consisted in malice, and laying of new snares to catch others in, in which
Providence thought it most fit, that himself should first be taken.

Observations on the Irish Rebellion.
IT is without all question, that the King was more indulgent toward the Irish
blood-thirsty Rebels, than suited with his public professions and often
protestations; I shall not say so much in projecting that horrible Massacre of
the English there, as in protecting those Rebels after the fact was committed,
having (to use his own expression) such visible designs and ends of his own,
as from the very beginning of the War, and before, to make use of their service
against the English and their Representative, as that in any impartial eye
could neither look handsome or suitable to the Religion he professed. To treat
of the original ground of this rising, or to point out the Author and the
authority by which those vile Caytiffes enterprised on so barbarous an act, is
more than I shall here deliver, for this is as yet a hidden piece of villainy,
although this I can affirm from the mouth of a Gentleman well borne, though I
dare not say of any great credit, that before the Kings going into SCOTLAND,
and before the flight of the Lord Iermin, he being then a kind of an attendant
on the Queen, and having many times admission into Master Iermins Chambers,
averres, that he saw nine several Commissions sealed in Master Iermins
lodging, for so many Regiments to be commanded by the like number of Colonels
in Ireland, whereof one was to Colonel Plunket, but with what seals the
Gentleman has not declared, neither do I believe that he was able to
distinguish between the Broad and the Privy seal: But this is most manifestly
known, that the Rebels for a long time, and at the very beginning of their
rising styled themselves the King and Queens Army, and that they had good
authority for doing that which they had done; and this is most perspicuous,
that the King himself was ashamed to be seen or to own his own work, and
with what instructions and Commissions he had empowered the Marquess of Ormand,
as in his own private Letter to him evidently appears, Number 22. December 13.
1644. from Oxford, viz.

I hope my public dispatch will give you sufficient instructions and power,
yet I have thought it necessary, for your more encouragement in this necessary
work, to make this addition with my own hand; as for Poynings act, I refer
you to my other Letters, and for matter of Religion, though I have not found it
fit to take public notice of the paper which Brown gave you, yet I must
command you to give him, my Lord Muskery, and Plunket particular thanks for it,
assuring them that without it there could be no peace, and that sticking to it,
their Nation in general, and they in particular, should have comfort in what
they have done, and to show that this is more than words, I do promise them,
and command you to see it done, that the Penal Statutes against Roman
Catholics shall not be put in execution, the Peace being made, and they
remaining in their due obedience; and further, when the Irish gives me that
assistance which they have promised, for the suppression of this Rebellion, and
I shall be restored to my rights, then I will consent to the repeat of them by
Law, but all those of Appeals (...) Rome and Praemunire must stand; all this in
Cipher you must impart to none, but to those three already named, and that with
injunction of strict secrecy; so (...) recommending to your care the speedy
dispatch of the Peace of Ireland, and my necessary supply from thence, as I
wrote to you in my last Letter, I rest.

Observations.
We have here in the first place, a manifestation of the Kings close and
serpentine windings, in the next his injunction of strict secrecy to Ormond,
that that which he had written in Cipher, should not be imparted to any, but
Muskery, Brown, and Plunket, three of the most desperate Rebels in that
Kingdom, which cannot possibly stand with the Kings innocence, neither with the
breach of his faith with the Parliament and people, or with God in point of his
protestations to maintain the true Protestant Religion, where it is evident,
that he played fast and loose on all hands as best suited with his necessary
affairs and work, (as he calls it) all his ends tending to this only center,
to gain the Irish Rebels to his assistance against the Parliament at any rate,
though to the profanation of Religion, and his breach of faith with God and
man, as instantly you may see fearfully protested, at the receiving the
Sacrament at Christ-Church in Oxford 1643. at the hands of the Bishop of
Armagh, where, immediately before his communicating, (he beckoning to the
Bishop for a short forbearance) used these following expressions, viz.

My Lord, I epsy here many resolved Protestants, who may declare to the world
the resolution I do now make; I have to the uttermost of my power prepared my
Soul to become a worthy receiver, and may I so receive comfort by the blessed
Sacrament, as I do intend the establishment of the true reformed Religion, as
it stood in its beauty in the happy days of Queen Elizabeth, without any
connivance at Popery; I bless God, that in the midst of these public
distractions, I have still liberty to communicate, and may this Sacrament be my
damnation if my heart join not with my lips in this Protestation.

Observation.
Having seriously considered this strange Protestation of the Kings, on the
taking of the Sacrament, with the imprecation of his damnation, if his heart
joined not with his lips, as I compared it with his letter after to Ormond,
together with his many other Protestations I profess in the faith of a
Christian, I stood amazed what to think of him, and his Religion; considered
again, as it was taken before a public audience, and yet the very next year
after, he makes no scruple or conscience to promise to Ormond the repeal of all
laws against Irish Papists; and likewise in his Letter to the Queen of the 9th.
of March 1645. he gives way to her to promise in his name, the taking away of
all penal Laws against the English Papists, so that they shall enable him to
do it; where it seems he makes no manner of account of a Parliament, without
which, as already is said, never any King of England either made or repealed
any one Law, surely it is here very plain, that he understood not the extent of
his own power, neither the nature of the English Sovereignty, or that he was
disposed not to know it, but to rule without Parliaments, provided, that by the
assistance of Papists he might be empowered to do it, and then that his will
should be a Law to the people; just Tyrant like, stat pro ratione voluntas; but
take the rest of his Letter to Ormond into your more mature consideration, and
then happily it will astonish you, where he hastens him to clap up the Peace
with the Rebels, which so soon as it shall be accomplished (he vows haec
verba, in his Letter to him Number 23 January 7. 1644.) All the earth shall not
make me break it; but not doubting of a peace, I must again remember you to
press the Irish for their speedy assistance to me here, and their friends in
Scotland, my intention being to draw from thence into Wales (the peace once
concluded) as many as I can of my armed Protestant subjects; and I desire the
Irish would send as great a body as they can to land about CVMBERLAND.

Observation.
Here again we have a sufficient proof of this most unfortunate Princes
inflexibility, his resolutions once fixed, there were no hopes of their
alteration (they are his own words) all the earth shall not make me break it,
though such resolutions break him in pieces, and sure we are many thousands of
his poor innocent Subjects through this only fault of his obstinacy. It Is an
infallible truth, that the wilful man never wants woe, but when one man's
perverse will shall be the cause of the destruction of multitudes, that is a
fearful judgment and a remediless calamity. We have also in this Letter an
evident testimony, what an inveterat hatred he bare toward the English Nation,
and those Scots which took their parts, which he hated beyond belief, and all
others which never so little fell a thwart his inclinations, where I shall
crave your favor to tell all of you that sided with him, (happily more for your
own ends than out of conscience) for it is most certain, that he made no other
account of you, but to satisfy his own lust, in your destruction, whatsoever
he pretended, and to prove this, I will tell you a true story, and it is this;
On the death of the late Earl of Northampton, whose Commands in one of his
Forests he presently gave away, of which Endimion Porter understanding, pressed
him that the young Earl his son, whose father was then newly slain in his
service, was fit to have that conferred on him than on any other, on which
check of Porters he replied, and has the Earl done more than became him, to
dye for his King? This is no fable, but a known truth, whereby you may guess
how he esteemed of you all, as if his Subjects were a sort of Sheep ordained to
the slaughter, for the obtaining of his lustful pleasure, and not him, as the
Shephard ordained to preserve them as that flock committed to his care and
charge from God himself; you may instantly find this very story verified and
set out unto the life in his former Letter, in which with what earnestness he
presses ORMOND, to hasten over the Irish to his assistance, yea to bring over
as many of his armed Protestants to land in Wales, as might enable him to
overpower both nations to his absolute domination and revenge. A most brutish
resolution, and of purpose to reset all his Kingdoms on a light fire, in
setting of Protestants against Protestants, and Papists against both; you may
further observe, how his displeasure grew to be so implacable against the Scots
his native Subjects, and to lay his design to destroy them together with his
English Subjects, and the reason of this you may perfectly see, in his Letter
to Ormond, Number 25. Feb. 25. 1647. viz. I do therefore command you to
conclude a Peace with the Irish whatsoever it cost, so that my Protestant
Subjects there may be secured, and my regal Authority preserved; but for all
this you are to make the best bargain you can, and not discover your
enlargement of power, till you needs must, and although I leave the Managing of
this great and necessary work, entirely to you, yet I cannot but tell you, that
if the suspension of Poynings act, for such bills as shall be agreed upon there,
and the present taking away of the penal Laws against Papists by a Law, will
do it, I shall not think it a hard bargain, so that freely and vigorously they
engage themselves in my assistance, against my Rebels of England and Scotland;
for which no condition can be to hard, not being against Conscience and Honor.

Observation.
You may first observe in this Letter the large extent of the Kings Conscience
and Honor, in the next place his seeming care for the preservation of his
Protestant Subjects in Ireland, with a purpose rather to make use of them
against their Brethren of England, than to leave them in Ireland for their own
defense, where their service was much more necessary, than to be employed in
the slaughtering of the English, with the hazard of their own lives, and for no
other end, but to advance their own prodigious, and bloody designs; for observe
it in the former Letter, he manifestly declares his resolution, to call them
over to his assistance, and here he tells it, that as to the Irish, if the
taking away of Poynings act, and the penal Statutes against Papists by a Law
will do it, he shall not think it a hard bargain, provided they freely and
vigorously engage against his English and Scottish Rebels, for which no
conditions can be too hard, not being against Conscience and Honor; here you
may safely aver is one of the strangest Consciences, and an Honor so
illimitable, as that I am confident, the subtillest Logitian in his Oxford
Garrison, would be driven to his ne plus ultra, to give either of them a right
definition, that close of not being against Conscience or Honor (considered
with his former commands to Ormond) without doubt is one of the finest pieces
of Nonsense that ever I have seen; and surely had I been in the Marquesses
place, that very restriction in the close, would have made me to forbear the
putting in execution of any of his commands, for there was not a syllable of
them all, but in due construction was, or ought to have been against his
Conscience and Honor; sure it was point blank opposite to his many
Protestations, and that fearful imprecation of his Damnation on his receiving
the Sacrament at Christ-Church; and doubtless in my understanding (all parts
of this Letter considered) the very last clause of not being against Conscience
or Honor, would have been sufficient warrant for me, to have sat still and
done nothing toward the concluding of so Irreligious and dishonorable a
Peace; But I beseech you look upon the Kings ends, and you shall find them to
be no other, than in a brutish manner to set all his Subjects together by the
ears, to kill and make havoc of one anothea, English against English, Scots
againt Scots, and Irish against both, so that he might thereby accomplish his
own pernicious designs; And in the mean time to make no manner of scruple or
Conscience of spilling of Innocent blood, and without the least remorse of that
horrible Massacree of 200000 of the English Nation, butchered by those
barbarous Villains for whom he was so solicitous, to defend them, and to
procure a happy peace for them whatsoever it cost; and with so many wiles and
fetches he had so often endeavored to engage them to join with Ormond against
Inchiquine and the Scots, as that you may evidently see in the Postscript of
his Letters to him, number 24. 1644. from Oxford, as also in his Commissions to
Montrosse, first to ruin the Scots, and after to come for his assistance into
England.

Now that you may further understand what Conscience he made of bloodshed, and
what care he had to preserve his Subjects in Peace and Prosperity, I shall tell
you another story from the mouth of one of his principal Commanders (Gerrard
by name) who upon the rendition of his Oxford Garrison came to London, and made
his addresses to Sir John Merricke at Essex house, desiring him that he might
have the Honor to kiss my Lord of Essex his hands, Sir John told him, That he
had not behaved himself worthy of the name and honor of a Soldier, to be
admitted to such a favor, having barbarously burnt his Lordships house at
Lamphey, together with most of the Gentlemen's houses of the County of Pembroke,
and destroyed the whole Country even to desolation; Gerrard replies in his
usual Oath, God damme me Uncle, if I did more than the King from Cardiffe by
two several Letters strictly commanded me to do; and then to march to him
with all my Army, for which I have his Majesty's own Letters for my Warrant.
Here is an excellent Conscience, and care, in a King bound by his Oath to
preserve his Subjects from violence, and yet commanding to destroy them with
fire and rapine.

Sir, in a few words more, would you be pleased, on an exact perusal of all
this most unhappy Kings Declarations and transactions, considered as you shall
always find them, sweetened and gilded over with the plausible pretenses, and
specious professions of his love and care toward all his Subjects (when he
meant nothing less) and many of them confirmed with Imprecations; I say
compare them diligently with his actions, and the Letters of his own hand
writing (which of other evidences are the best keys to unlock the secrets of
man's heart) not leaving out that Posthumus Imposture of his Pourtraicture, and
I am confident that the contrariety, dissimulation, hypocrisy, and juglings
you shall every where find in them, interwoven with a Pharisaicall justifying
of himself, and defending all his actions, will astonish you, as they have done
me; For in all the late horrid War and bloodshed, throughout the three
Kingdoms, you shall find it for an infallible truth, that he who spoke and
insisted so much on his Honor and Conscience for many years together, never
made any Conscience, or was truly sensible of all the blood spilt either in
his own behalf, or against him, more than of one wicked The Earl of Strafford.
Man's, though condemned by Law, and the just judgment of a Court of
Parliament, and this man also acknowledged by himself to be uttterly unworthy
to bear any public office in the Commonwealth, and until God in his Justice
turned the power of his Sword to nothing, then indeed, and as I may judge
(really) he ever now and anon deplores the sad condition of his Kingdoms, but
never sincerely (as I am bound to believe) till he had don his worst, and all
that possibly he could invent to ruin the Parliament, and to destroy all those
that stood up in their defense; And toward his last, his principal labor
tended to little more than in pitying of himself, and complaining of the hard
measure offered him during his restraint, that he was not admitted to a
Personal Treaty with the Parliament for the procuring (as he would have it
believed) of a happy peace, when in all his Treatyes and specious overtures
from the first to the last, his hand was well known to be in one plot or other
how to get himself out of that toil and Labyrinth wherein he had wilfully
entangled himself and the Kingdoms, being still one and the self same man,
justifying himself, and standing on his own innocence with the Pharisee, but
little of the Publican, God be merciful to me a sinner; still in his wonted
inflexibility to the last, utterly refusing to sign (only) Four Bills for the
public security; continuing his usual pretenses that they were against his
Conscience and Honor; When as all the Kingdom long since knew him to be
preingaged to the Queen, and that by one word of her mouth, both his Honor and
Conscience would easily have been dispensed withal: This I may truly and
further affirm for a piece of a miracle, that somewhat before Gods just
judgments overtook him (though not without a long conflict) he acknowledged
himself guilty of all the War, and not without entreaties to a noble Person, on
the first motion for a Treaty in the I sle of Wight, That the Parliament would
forbear to charge all the guilt of the blood spilt throughout the Kingdoms on
his only score, and on that condition he should not be so uncivil, as to
impute the least guilt thereof on them; they were his own words, for that was a
fear which much troubled him would be charged upon him, and well he might fear
it, when his own Conscience was a witness against him; but in the mean time,
suffer me to ask you, how shall Almighty God be satisfied for so much blood
causlesly and wilfully spilt throughout three Kingdoms, whose wrath cannot be
appeased, neither the Land be cleansed, until expiation be made for the blood
of one man, by the shedding of his blood which was the murderer? surely then
we cannot determine, what account Almighty God will yet require at their hands
which have been principal actors with the King in this bloody tragedy (though
some of them, as he has done, have paid their debts to Nature, and not a few
by way of Composition) yet they also have just cause to fear that there is an
account not yet cleared, which will be called upon: This I shall add by the
way of Question, how and by what Fate this most unfortunate Prince came to be
so overpowred with the Enchantments of a Woman, betwixt whom and himself, it
is well known, a good space after their Inter-marriage, there were many jarres,
and continued fallings out, and yet at last she alone to become his Oracle for
the leading on of all his designs; In so much as he durst not offend her in
the least punctilio, or to transact any thing of never so little moment without
her good liking, and approbation, and so much to dote on her, as not to permit
the Prince to stir a foot, or to undertake anything, but by her only direction,
such an absolute power and command had this Queen gained over him and his
affections; we may put the Quaerie farther, why otherwise than by her Counsel,
he first took away the Prince from his Guardians, and not long after the Duke
of York, and to send them beyond Sea, unless it were out of an apprehension,
that in imitation of former Presidents, this Parliament might Crown the one or
the other Brother, instead of the Father, who had been so disastrous to the
Nation, as diverse old presidents of the like nature might probably induce him
to suspect out of his own guiltiness of his misgovernment? as for instance the
dethroning of Edw. the second by the Parliament for his misgovernment and
bloody reign, and the advancing (in his life time) of his Son Edward the
third, as also the deposing of Richard the second for his Tyranny, and the
Parliaments setting up of Rullingbrooke, his Cosen German in his room;
Presidents which doubtless he deeply apprehended and feared, which to prevent
it is most probable he sent them out of the Kingdom, though to his own, and the
utter undoing of those Innocent Princes, which he had so far engaged in his
bloody quarrel, that they became dyed in the same color with their wilful
Father. I shall now present you with a proof of the former assertion out of the
Kings own Letter to the Prince from Newcastle Number 28. 1646. viz. Charles,
This is rather to tell you where I am in health, than at this time to direct
you in any thing, I having so fully wrote to your Mother what I would have you
to do, whom I command you to obey in every thing, except Religion, concerning
which, I am confident she will not trouble you; and see you goes not any
whither, without hers or my particular directions.

Observation.
Here you may evidently see, by what Star not only himself and all his affairs
were guided, but that his Son must be tied up, not to do any thing, or move,
but by his Mothers or his own particular directions; a very strange obligation
laid on a Son, to be bound to such an absolute obedience, as necessarily
conduced to his utter undoing, when as no man knows whether a Wife and a
Mother, which had such a latitude of power over the Father and the Son, would
not be tampering with a Prince (even in the point of Religion) of so tender
years as rendered him fit for any impression, and to be indoctrinated with such
principles as well concerning Religion, as others best suitable to her own
designs. But I beseeeh you judge of the following texts, and tell me whether
they suite not with this most unhappy Kings disposition, and the ways
whereinto the inflexibility of his nature lead him to perseverance, in
pursuance of his own destruction.

He that speaks unrighteous things cannot be hid, neither shall vengeance when
it is punished pass by him: For inquisition shall be made into the Counsels
of the ungodly, and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the
manifestation of his wicked deed. Wisd. 1. 8. 9.

A Sinful man will not be reproved, but sends an exeuse according to his
will: A man of Counsel will be considerate, but a strange and a proud man it
not daunted with fear, even when of himself he has done without Counsel.
Eccles. 32. 17. 18.

But I have now little more to address unto you, yet more than I would, had
not your provocations amounting to a plain challenge invited me to answer your
many virulent complaints, wherein I have inserted very little more than what
you may find expressly laid down either in the Kings own Letters or
Declarations, and with no other comments (as to the Observations) but such as
necessarily arise out of the expressee themselves; neither to any other ends,
(as to the first part of my Reply, but for the clearing of truth, and to show
out unto you both the constitution of our late most unhappy King, and the
manner and condition of all other Kings; I could have sent you more, and God
knows more terrible, bloody, and barbarous, but this is enough, though I say
not to convince you, (for that would be no other than lavare Aethiopem) but to
let you know how much you have been mistaken in the late King, a Prince
doubtless which was much too dark for every ones understanding, and too hard
for most of his Council of State, whom he trusted with the mannagery of his
greatest both designs and secrets; though it be most true, that how tenacious
and close soever he was in carrying on that arbitrary work to inslave the
Nation, yet God in his mercy would not that they should be so secretly hidden,
but that he had appointed a time when they should be revealed and manifested to
the World, as we all know they were at Naseby and elsewhere, according to our
blessed Saviors own oracle Mat. 12. 2. For there is nothing covered that shall
not be revealed, neither hid which shall not be known.

God knows, and so may you on your better consideration, that I have made use
of nothing but authentic authority, or took up any passage on bare trust,
neither with the least intention to injure the memory of him who is at rest,
but only in vindication and manifestation of truth, and to make that more
visibly known to you, which long since has not been unknown to many, which
happily if they would might speak more, and that as this most unfortunate
Prince was of all others most his own enemy, so had providence decreed it,
that he should be most injurious to his friends, a most implacable enemy to
Parliaments, and utterly averse to all partnership in government, other than
Hers which was the principal instrument of his ruin, the undoing of his
posterity, and the lamentable destruction of three flourishing Kingdoms.

As to the present Government, and change of the Royalty, or any other of your
impetuous exclamations, with the exceptions you take to the present Form,
different from the forms of ancient Parliament, and as it was so lately
altered, without King, Lords, and the major part of the excluded Commons, and
that those which now sit at Westminster, are no other than usurped powers
acting in Tyranny, as all of your party spares not to belch out both in private
and public, I shall instantly give you both a short and satisfactory answer to
every of them; and first to the Government, which you know to be gotten by
Conquest, and as heretofore I have told you, by the same weapon wherewith the
King intended to make it absolutely Monarchical, and A la Francoys As to the
difference between the old and this new Form of Parliament, I answer, that the
King himself was the first projector, both in lessening, altering and laming of
the Parliament, witness his taking into his Council of State the Earls of
Hartford, Essex, Bath, the Lords Say, St. Maur, Falkland, and Culpepper, all of
them known to be the most noted Commonwealths men of both Houses, within two
months of the Parliaments sitting down, and within one year after to corrupt
near the moity of the Members of both Houses, to make up his Mungrel Parliament
at Oxford, of set purpose to confuse and ruin all Parliaments by themselves.
As to the late purging of the Houses, it is acknowledged that in the midst of
such a confusion as was both raised, cherished and fomented by the King
himself, and the Malignant party, it was done by the power of the Army, and as
I take it on this ground, that the major part of both Houses voted for the
readmittance of the King on such condition which himself refused, which the
lesser and more foreseeing part well understood would in the end come to no
other issue, than the setting him up into his old power, so to enable him a new
to embroyle the Kingdoms, having so long before engaged the Prince in his
Quarrel, and disciplined him in his designs, in so much as no other hopes
were then left the Parliament, but either a perpetuating of the War and more
bloodshed, or the invassalage of the Nation, which necessarily would be the
consequence, on the admittance either of the Father or the Son; upon these
grounds it is confessed, that the Soldiery ended the controversy, in assisting
the weaker party in Parliament, though doubtless the more able in judgment
and foresight of the future evils and calamities which in all probability
might and would befall the Nation; which to prevent, on the evidence of the
Kings obstinacy, it was resolved to remove the Effects, by taking away the
Cause, in calling the principal Author of all the former bloodshed to his
public trial, to stop which issue it was farther resolved to cut him off,
together with his whole posterity, and to cast that pilot overboard, that not
more out of ignorance than wilfulness, would obstinately have sunk the Ship
of the Public, in the vast Ocean of his Prerogative, had it not been timely
rescued, and warp't into the safe Harbor of a Republic, and in change the
Regal Government into a Commonwealth, as you now see it established, by power,
and by the same power, probable it is they will uphold it, which as it is
commonly conceived, was the true state and managery of that business Where you
may observe it, as a very remarkable event, that even the major part of of
both Houses which had stood so constant to the trust of their Countries, to the
very Vote of No more Addresses, and were inclined to readmit the King (as we
may believe by Gods just judgment) were taken away by force, as the King
himself by fraud had long before drawn away so many of the Members, purposly
to lame and weaken all Parliaments in the future.

Sir, These are passages of a very transcendant nature, and too high for our
understanding, and we know Gods ways and works are unsearchable, yet as the
Eccl. ^. 9. 10.
Wise man tells us, There is nothing new under the Sun, and is there any thing
whereof it may be said, see, this is new? it has been already fold time, and
was before us: howsoever, when you have spoken the worst you can* of those
which now sit in Parliament, you cannot deny but the most of them are of the
old legal Electron, and the relicts of the old Form, they which have been the
cause of the maiming, or lessening the number and quality of the old Form, you
may thank them for it, and not blame those that remain faithful to their
trust, for some kind of Government the people must have, and you evidently
see, that God has given them both Courage to stand fast to the last, and power
to enable them to act as they do, which as heretofore I have told you will
either bend you to obedience, or break you in your resistance. As to the
Injustice wherewith you charge them, and the Tyranny you so much exclaim
against, I take not upon me to be so much their Champion, as to defend every of
their actions, or any Injustice, of which not unlikely some of them may be
guilty; for where power is invested, faults there may be, and foul ones too;
yet this much may be said in their defense, that those of known integrity, fail
not to look into the demeanor of the faul ty, and by severe punishment to make
them examples of Justice; I shall say no more, but that should they fail in
doing righteousness, Judgment stands at their own doors, and the same God
which gave them the power they now have, will as soon divest them of it, as he
bequeathed it unto them, and 1 Samuel 1^. 15.
Samuel will tell them; If you do wickedly you shall be consumed, both you and
your King. Now Sir, for a close, I shall only tell you, that it suffices me
and all sober spirits (that having thus long lived free from bloodshed and
plunder under this Government, which so lately under the Kingly power the whole
Nation felt to their great grief and sorrow) it behooves us then that we all
rest content with Gods good will and pleasure, and leave this great change to
him, as a work of his own, which, I may say with Gamaliel, If it be not of God
it will surely fall, but if from him, he will establish it, in spite of all
those which shall withstand it: it is most true, that the Contributions and
Taxes, which you urge to be Tyrannically imposed on the whole Nation, are very
heavy, to which I have already given you an answer, viz. that we may all thank
your party for it, that they are not only continued but increast through your
parties only means, which cease not by their assiduall plots to disturb the
present peace and Government to their own loss, and grief of such as would
willingly bear the burden, so they might enjoy their peace and quietness, as
having learned the sweetness of that old Addage, defend me, and spend m^. In a
word more, I shall advise you in particular to rest content with that
Government which Providence has allotted us, under which you may as yet live
both secure and plentiful if you please, dispose your self therefore to yield
that Obedience which becomes all those that love the public, and their own
domestic peace; If not, I fear me you will kick against the pricks, hurt, if
not utterly ruin your self and Family, as many thousands of perverse Fools
have done, and fail not to remember, that there is a Court of Justice that
spares none which shall disturb the public peace, and that Government which
we may safely believe, God has and will establish.

This is the Counsel of him who really has a care of your preservation, and
so rests,

Your well-wishing Friend if you so please to esteem him.

Lo this is the man that made not God his strength, but trusted in the
abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness. P. 52. 7.
The words of his mouth were smoother than Butter, but War was in his heart,
his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn Swords. Psalm 55. 21.
But thou O Lord shall bring them down into the pit of destruction, bloody and
deceitful men shall not live out half their days. verse 23.
FINIS.
