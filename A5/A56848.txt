THE Citizens Flight With their RE-CALL; To which is added ENGLANDS TEARS AND
ENGLANDS COMFORTS

By JOHN QUARLES.

London, Printed in the Year, (...).

THE CITIZENS Flight and Fear, etc.
WHat does the Whale pursue a shole of fish?
Whether so fast; no safety, but in wish?
Whether, ah! whether, will ye take your flight?
Gods Arrows fly by day, as well as Night:
No Path's without a Judgment; Do not waste,
And spend your times; bring danger by ye'r haste:
Stay, stay, lest in your hasty flight ye meet
(Your hearts must bring your safety, not your Feet)
The thing you fly from; Judgment knows no bound,
And he that lurkes most close is soonest found:
Can the poor timorous game lie hid, or bauke
The furious Talons of the Quick-ey'd Hawk?
The all-discerning eye of Heaven can see
That ill which lurks in most obscurity;
And he that hides himself, does but discover
Himself, because Gods Judgments always hover
And fly aloof; there is no way to shun
The piercing heat of the Meridian Sun:
They must expect more Pestilential times,
That lives in the Equinoctial of their Crimes;
The Dog Star of our lusts does now excel,
And governs to a perfect Miracle:
What shall we sin, and think our sins shall pass
Without reward; shall we do good, Alas!
(And that we seldom do) and not expect
To bring our labor to a good effect!
We cannot act but Heaven will sure regard
Our actions, and afford us our reward,
Especially if good, it is each mans-deed
That either heals his wound, or makes it bleed.
The hand of Heaven strikes sure, and he that flies
To save his life, often in his flying dies;
But if we needs must fly, let our flight be
Lord from our too too sinful selves to thee;
If not, we only flutter in the night
Not knowing how, nor where, we take our flight;
We fly to the terra incognita, and there
Our flights rewarded with perpetual care;
But if we to the Land of promise fly
We enjoy the blessing of a serene Skey:
There Is, there is the place, where neither cold nor heat.
Are in extremes, all things are good, and great;
No diminutions, but completed Fate
Is still supported in a constant State.
My Muse is grown melodious and it sings (wings;
We need not fear our flight when Heaven gives
Angelick plumes can neither flag nor tire
No air so powerful as a good desire;
A good desire is like a Chymick heat
Constant and fervent, not to small, nor great;
For if it be not constant, it retards
Putrefaction; and he is happy that regards
The end of his beginning; he that begins
In Mercy, is to blame to end in Sins:
He sins indeed that sins against the light
Of his own knowledge, let perpetual might
Be still intayl'd on him that will not say
He knows a difference betwixt night and day;
Yet sin and ignorance makes all things dark,
Light though contained in the smallest spark
Is light enough to let our darkness know
There is a God, whose goodness did bestow
These lights upon us; a dark Lanthorn may
Be light to others, yet to me it is day:
Though heaven himself did oftentimes appear
And speak in Clouds, yet was his language clear;
Though he appeared in fire, he checked the flame,
The bush was unconsum'd; though Moses came
To see his face; yet he was glad at heart
To know his fore-side, by his hinder part;
I Am sure oh Lord thou have no other face
But what I want; and what is that? it is grace
Lord I am satisfied, and I will be
Content to feel the thing I cannot see,
And let my last experience make it good,
Thy hand is sealed with my Redeemers blood;
I hope the Bond's uncancel'd; if it be
Lord thou art paid, I hope, and I am free;
I mean from my Original; but Lord
I must confess, I Have lately past my word,
And I have broke my promise, Lord the Gaol
Must be my refuge, for I have no Bail
Except thy Mercy, which I have so often
Abused, Lord, and at thy Judgments scoft;
That should I now presume to make a trial,
I 'Justly might expect thy just denial:
Yet why should thou deny me? had the Thief
His pardon, and shall I have no relief?
Lord, pardon this my rashness, how dare I
Expostulate with thee; or ask a why
My lips are sealed, yet oh Lord, I dare?
Give me but Grace, to open them by Prayer;
As thou have given Prayer for my heart,
So give my heart for prayer; let me not part
Till I am answered; nay, I will (if prayer)
Has any power, extenuate my care,
On purpose to enlarge it; I will be
An Orator, till thy Divinity
Shall melt, as Clouds drop fruitful showers of Rain,
And make me only fit to beg again:
All other Judgments wispers, this cries loud;
Let Us Judge the tempest, by the approaching cloud;
Oh how unhappy is that purblind Land
That takes the little Finger for the Hand?
Judgment will make us tremble by degrees,
Reader, remember great Belshazars knees;
Needs must that woeful Nation be acurst,
(Suspect Religion) when Divines fly first;
They have forgot what was the Israelites hap,
When powerful Moses sentenell'd the gap:
Will Moses fly from Aaron, oh hard-heart!
It Is a bad sign when loving Brothers part.
How shall poor hungry Infants get their bread
When their hard-hearted Nurses all are fled;
Oh cruel tyranny! what can be worse,
When the poor Infant's murdered by the Nurse?
Hard-hearted Nurse; that can be so unkind,
To fly away and leave her Babe behind;
Fly Nurses, fly, to any secret place,
But be so kind to leave the Babe of grace;
I mean, your Charities; and then we shall
By our Diseases thrive, when you will fall,
By your despair, endeavor to be true,
Then praise your God with soul and body too;
For he that made them both, has the same power
To save them both from an unhappy hour;
Be careful, and amidst your cares be just,
There is no greater sin then sad distrust:
Distrust invites a Plague, when humble zeal,
Can palliate by degrees the infected weal.
Prayers, Sighs, and Tears, being well composed, can
Cure all distempers incident to man.
If this be then our Cure, let hearts and eyes
Agree together; let our storms arise
And never cease until they have spent their showers,
When we have spent our store, Heaven shows his (powers:
Our end is his beginning, let us end
Our sins, and he will soon begin to send
His Mercy to complete a happy story,
For blessed beginnings always end in glory;
Prayer is an introduction to our bliss
And makes the offender, and the offended kiss,
Not kiss, and part; but kiss and so conjoyne,
And turn our tears of Water into Wine,
Wine Sacramental, mercy makes it sweet
Oh! happy time when sin and mercy meet;
Meet, not to stay together; but to part,
For both cannot be welcome to one heart.
Have I not seen a flock of Birds, whose flight
Has bin occasioned by a sudden fright;
Fly up and down and clamoring in the Air
Expressed their sudden fright and present care?
Nay I have known such fear has been among
Those clamorous Birds, that they have left their young:
Why does the City thus pursue the Court?
Knowing, ah lass! this is no age for sport,
For Gaming's out of fashion in these times;
Yet we may stake, and pray away our Crimes;
The looser's only happy, for he wins
That looses, by Divinity, his sins:
But stay (Kind Reader) let us a little pause,
And see if we can find, where lies the Cause;
What think thou of a sinful heart that lies
Groaning beneath his griping miseries?
What think thou of a sin-infected breast
That is by nothing but it self oppressed?
What think thou of a Nation whose sad crimes
Has so infected our perplexed times
That it is impossible by humane skill
To give a Remedy to so much ill?
Call all thy faculties, and let them join
Themselves together, and by faith combine;
Let Us search each cranny of our sinful hearts,
And let us weep as we have sung, in parts;
Lets weep until our tears do overflow
Our sorrow; let us sigh until we know
What it is to barter happiness for grief,
It Is only Faith can Crown us with relief.
Now courteous Reader, give me leave to make
A small digression: Know it is for thy sake
That I endeavor by a faithful art
To give a Cordial to each bleeding heart:
When once it is known where the distempets lie
We may the sooner hope for remedy;
That Patient much in understanding fails
That will not tell his Doctor what he ayls;
Oh! who would not his thankful patient be
Where Physic and advise are both so free?
His Physic has such operative power
That it gives ease in less then half an hour;
Oh depth of mercy! oh unbounded skill!
Oh rare prescription of a sacred will!
Then do not fly, but let your hopes increase,
Repent, and then he surely will speak peace;
Till then it is but in vain to move, or fly;
Oh! look upon him with a watchful eye,
Then shall thou see how soon he will impart
His heavenly joys to a contristed heart;
Remember he is not a God of blood,
But takes delight to do a sinner good:
Remember those blessed Tears which once he shed
Over Jerusalem; and how he spread
His mercy over Israel, and pours
His goodness on our heads in liberal showers;
He is a God whose mercy knows no bounds;
His balm of grace being poured into our wounds
Does so complete our Cure, and ease our pain,
That the Disease will never return again;
And being from our malladies set free;
The gold of prayer is all the Doctors Fee:
The Scriptures are our guide, it is that which tells
Where this most kind and blessed Physician dwells;
Faith, Hope and Charity, those sacred three
Are his Housekeepers, and Humility,
His lodging Chamber, and the faithful Breast
The Kitchen where his Diet must be dressed:
Oh Lord! we know thy Table's always spread,
Oh give us faith, that we may eat thy bread;
And since thy goodness thou have thus expressed,
It Is no presumption, Lord, to be thy guest;
Thou freely do invite, and shall not we
Answer thy invitation and be free
To make our near approches; Lord enable
Our hearts, that we may come unto thy table;
And then, O Lord! thy table being spread,
Bless us with grace and we will eat thy bread;
We Will eat thy heavenly Manna without strife,
And feed our souls to everlasting life;
We Will praise thy name for what thy goodness sent,
As we have sinned we will labor to repent,
That so thou may commis'rate and remove
Thy Judgments, and then Crown us with thy Love;
Then shall our thankful hearts proclaim and tell
What thou have done for thine own Israel;
Then shall our joyful lips proclaim a peace,
Whilst grace and mercy ever more increase;
And let us know when Judgment comes so near,
That ruin or repentance must appear;
Delays are dangerous; let us therefore pray
And call upon him whilst it is yet to day,
That so our timely sorrows may remove
His heavy Judgments, and entreat his love
Once more to shine upon us, that we may
Enjoy the comfort of a glorious day:
Oh let us consider we have long bin free,
But still ungrateful for our liberty;
Oh let us think how long we have bin fed,
Yet seldom praised that hand which gave us bread;
Oh let us remember how forgetful we
Have bin, and how abused prosperity;
Oh let us consider how Religion stood
Not long since more then Ankle deep in blood;
Let Us call to memory, when our hearts decayed,
How Heaven revived us and encreast our Trade;
What store of mercy have we to persuade us
To bless that hand that both preserves and made us?
For should we own his mercies with neglect
We may injustice every day expect
New punishments, who studies to offend
Must not expect a peace or happy end!
Oh let us not against our maker Kick;
It Is too much honey that has made us sick;
How wanton have we bin in former times?
And still make idols of our bosom Crimes;
Thus we, persisting in our Follies, dare
Just Heaven to strike, whose goodness does forbear,
Whilst we even hug our ruin, and invite
Judgment to make an everlasting night.
But if Poetic Lines have any power
Let me persuade my Reader from this hour
To be considerare, And thus begin
To ruminate: Alas! it is my sin
Has caused these Judgments; Therefore is it not fit
That I who did industreously commit
So many Crimes, should by my fervent prayer
Endeavor to extenuate my care?
There is a balm in Giliad can make sound,
And Cure the anguish of the deepest wound;
The Heavenly Chiron has so great a store,
That he can find a Salve for every sore;
He that has promised will in mercy please
To give unto the heavy Laden ease;
We may be confident, and boldly trust
In him that is both merciful and just:
How happy is our flight, as often as we
Fly from our selves, oh Lord, and fly to thee;
Not do we ever with Devotion pray,
But thou do meet our language half the way;
And when our zeal does once begin to burn
Then do thou bless us with a quick return;
Then why should we distrust so good a God
That always shakes (before he strikes) his Rod?
Thy mercy keeps us in the darkest night,
Nor do thou in a sinners Death delight;
Oh let thy goodness spare us, for thine ire
We know full well is all-consuming fire;
It is thy mercy (Lord) must make us blessed,
Alas, we are but stubble at the best;
O turn us (Lord) or else we cannot turn;
For as we are, w' are only fit to burn,
And if we needs must burn, oh Lord, reveal
Thy self unto us till we flame in zeal;
Such holy flames (oh Lord) will so aspire
That thou will take a pleasure in our fire;
A zealous flame gives a most glorious light;
A Christian like a Glowworm, shines at night;
I care not Lord how dark I seem to be
Unto the world, if I am light in thee;
Oh let him grope in everlasting night
That will not own thee for the chiefest Light;
Be thou oh Lord, my Light, my Guide, my Way,
Then shall I never err, nor go astray;
He need not fear in slippery waves to slide
That is supported by so blessed a Guide;
A guide, whose goodness can as well direct
In power, as he in mercy can protect;
Be pleased oh Lord, to bring my feeble sight
From my Caemerian darkness to thy light;
Oh give me light enough to let me see
My horrid darkness, let my object be
Thy mercies; then shall my eclipsed eyes
Have light enough to see my miseries,
Lord let me see my sins, for sin and I
Even like the Bas'lisk, first discovered, die;
Then may I sing with a most heavenly mirth,
The death of sin gives Righteousness a birth;
The death of sin does period all our strife,
The life of sin is but a dying life.
Thus subtle death lies lurking in our sins
To catch us (when we struggle) in his gins,
But they that will avoid his crafty snare
Must first discover it by faith, and prayer;
And when discovered, it may well be said
The crafty traitor is himself betrayed;
Although he exercise his power so fast
Yet he himself shall be destroyed at last,
Whilst we (then glorified) shall sit and sing
Death where is thy power, oh Grave where is thy sting?
Then why should we (fond mortals) fear or dread
The thing that cannot hurt us, if we spread
Our arms to Heaven; he will take us by the hand
And safely lead us to the promised Land;
Then shall we have no cause to fear or doubt;
We that come weeping in, go smiling out;
Happy are we, if we the truth embrace,
Though we were born in sin, we die in grace;
The Midwives hand even dragged us to our Birth
Whilst we poor lumps of senseless, living Earth
Lie crying in her lap; but know not why
Yet every tear is then a prophecy;
The tender Infant does no sooner break
The prison of the Womb, but seems to speak
To this effect. Behold, see I am come
Naked and shiftless from my Mothers womb:
What shall I do, I have nor feet, nor hands
But what are useless, griping sorrow stands
Ready to snatch me from my Mothers breast,
Not suffering me to take a minutes rest.
Is this the world that fondlings dote upon?
Oh that I had but power to be gone!
I quickly would find out a place should be
Exempt from all encroaching misery;
This is no place of rest, I may deplore
My self, ah lass! I never cried before;
What, was I born to cry? strange kind of Birth,
Hard fate indeed, all Sorrow, and no Mirth!
Could I have kept my fleshly Cloister still
I never than had known the effects of ill;
But since my Birth has brought me to distress
My patience and my prayers shall make it less;
But stay, alas, my Birth is not the cause
Of my sad sorrows, but the breach of Laws;
It Is that, it is that which wounds me to the heart
It Is I that sinned, it is only I must smart
It Is only I; it is I, that must prepare
To bear the burden of mine own made care.
Who yelds to sin except he does repent
As well must yield unto the punishment;
If we do well, we then expect reward
But if we sin; we sin without regard:
How dis-ingenious are we in our wills
To goodness, how ingenious in our ills?
These are the things for which our guilty Land
Is now afflicted, and convicted stand;
It Is but in vain to plead except it be
To mercy; for our quick deliverie,
We Are our own Goalers, yet we have not power
To give our selves the freedom of an hour;
Our turn-key sins does lock us up so fast
We cannot stir, we must contrive to cast
Away our crimes; and then we must prepare
By heavenly art to pick the lock by prayer;
This is the way to freedom: Now I find
My own mistake, free mercy is so kind
That neither lock, nor door, nor bar can be
Infringers of a Converts liberty;
A sigh will melt the doors and break the lock,
Nothing opposes, when by Faith we knock;
And if the Hammer of our zeal be strong
We shall not need to give attendance long;
Knock, and it shall be opened; seek and find,
There Is nothing hard unto a willing mind,
Run, and ye shall obtain, Lord give us grace
That in our running we may mend our pace;
Oh let thy mercy with our sorrows meet
And then we shall have wings as well as feet;
And then we shall be sure to run the race
Of mercy, and to take our flight in grace;
For when in flight, or running, we shall spend
Our zealous strength, oh Lord be thou the End.
The RE-CALL.
STrange times my Masters, what unusual sight
Has terrified you to this sudden flight?
Still full of jealousies and fears, no hope
Of a re-settlement; ah give not scope
Too much to your own fancies, but incline
To bend your hearts to what is more Divine:
But stay, perhaps ye'ave lately had a sight
Of your own sins, and that has caused this flight;
Then fly until your eyes of faith have found
The Grand Physician that must make you sound;
Fly, till your wings are tired, fly night and day,
Mount in your flight, and in your flying, pray;
Pray till the fervent heat of true bred zeal
Shall melt your wings, your melting will reveal
Your penitency, and Repentance brings
A good Embassage from the King of Kings
Faith is the souls Ambassador, and prayer
The Embasie; the Hosts of heaven prepare
His entertainment, Sun, and Moon, and Stars
Are the swift Laquies that fore-run his Wars;
Thus whilst in hostile manner he appears,
Judgment beats up the Drum for Volunteers:
What shall we do (dear Countrymen) our crimes
Are so out-ragious, that the vvorst of times
Is our expectance; let us contrive, and think
What Is best to do, for we are at the brink
Of speedy ruin, and our senseless Land
Is crushed in pieces by an Iron hand,
An Iron hand of Justice, and it is vain
To Oppose, except by faith; nay we shall gain
More blows by opposition than (I Am sure)
It Is possible for nature to endure,
For what is nature in her greatest power
But weakness, and that weakness, every hour
Subject to sad mutations, humane skill
Like Josiah's Sun, goes backwards, or stands still;
Alas, we are like bull-rushes, inclined
To shake with every feeble blast of vvind,
We have no perminancy, every minit
Brings a most sudden alteration in it;
For what is man if rightly understood,
But a poor fabric, cemented with blood,
Daubed over with flesh, which one poor shovver of rain
Washes away; thus momentary, vain
Is silly man, a perfect Coin of sorrovv,
Received to day and paid away to morrow;
Although at first he was a noble Coin,
Stamped with that image which was all Divine,
Yet by his own endeavors he defaced
Himself, and by his fall so much disgraced
His frail and weak posterity, that time
Can not obliterate so soul a Crime,
Till mercy, when observing the persute
Of vengeance, brings us a most blessed recruit,
Which on a sudden turned the seal, and then
From miserable, we grew happy, men;
Happy in our Redeemer who thought good
By snedding his, to stop our guilty blood,
He by his sufferings did our woes obtrude;
If this be mercy, where is our gratitude?
Nor is his goodness tired, he still remains
Our Mediator; for our former stains
Are so apparent, that the best of art
Cannot give ease to a tormented heart;
And if our sins do more and more abound,
Judgment at last will be with vengeance Crowned;
What shall we do? what art, what skilful hand
Can give a prescript to a sinful Land?
To whom shall we address our selves? our skills
Are made imperfect by our stubborn wills,
Our wills areso antartick to what is good,
That we are lost except we make a flood,
A swelling flood, with water from our eyes,
That we may floar above our miseries;
There is an Ark of safety to be found
Which we must either fly unto, or drowned;
Let Us make a flood with our repentant tears,
That Noah's Ark may save us from our fears;
There let us rest until our Dove appear
And bring us tidings that the Land is clear?
We may lament and woefully bewail
Our miseries; oh let us not tire, and fail
In our repentance, but to ease our grief
(In multitudes of mercy lies relief)
Let Us fly to heaven upon the wings of zeal,
And in an humble manner there reveal
The sorrows of our hearts; when we begin
To swim in sorrow, we shall sink from sin*
Oh let the language of a hearty Verse,
Beloved Countrymen, take root, and pierce
Your stubborn hearts, I write not out of Pride
But out of zeal; I swell not with the tide
Of a Vainglorious scribler, but desire
By zeal-hot Verse to set your hearts on fire:
But you may say, and what you say, is true,
That your Advisor is as bad as you:
I do confess it with unfeigned lips;
But what is the Sun the worse for his eclipse?
The heavenly luminaries suffer pain
By their ecclipses, yet do shine again;
Never could any day be yet so proud
To lay it was not darkened by some Cloud;
And shall proud mortals dare presume to crave
A priv'ledge to go dancing to their Grave;
Would they find heaven on earth? no, heaven is higher
Though ^ften seated in a low desire;
Is not heaven humble, when it is often found
So zealously inclined to kiss the Ground?
Does not his heavenly influences make
The grass to spring for the poor Creatures sake?
Prayer is Angelick food, shall mortals be
Hard-hearted, and so starve that Hirarchie?
No, let our zealous Charities abound,
And then our labors shall be freely Crowned
With everlasting glory, and our peace
Never be waining, but shall still increase,
Increase, with so much plenty, that the earth
Shall groan in labor with a swelling birth,
Whilst satisfied mortals all shall sing
Anthems of peace to their mellifluous King;
And all, this all, is but the least of all,
It is a blessed Eternity that shall
Crown us at last with everlasting bliss;
Now tell me Reader what thou think of this,
Tell me what think thou, would thou not be quiet
And well content, to have such lasting diet?
Nay, when thou have eat, thy fill, it shall be said
Thou Art freely welesme, and thy reckoning paid;
Be not so much a Clown after all this cost
To go away, and not say, Thank thee Host;
Observe the thirsty fovvls that never sup
His plenty, but they gratefully look up;
Observe the very beasts how often they gaze
Up to the Heavens, and lowing, give him praise;
Observe each creature in his several kind,
As if by Nature they were all inclined
To give him thanks, do in a several tone
As tw're express their gratitude, and own
His liberality; whilst thankless men
Looks down-ward on the earth, and now, and then
Sends forth a sign or two, which often fly
Rather from nature than Divinity;
Then how can we expect that daily burn
In our own flames, Astrea will return?
How can we hope that heaven will Crown our days
With happiness, except we give him praise?
Shall we live still in darkness, when we may
Enjoy the blessing of a glorious day?
Shall we be still contriving how to be
The sole infringers of our liberty?
Poor silly mortals! how do we contrive
As 'twere to bury our own selves a live?
How senseless are we, that we neither look
Abroad, nor home, but like a Land forsook,
We fall into despair, nor do we make:
Our moans to heaven or hardly pity take
Upon our selves; so stupid are we grown,
That we are like a City turned to stone;
Our zeal is lost; our Charity is fled;
Our health is vanished, and our faith is dead;
Our love is turned to envy, and our praise
To chattering Nonsense, and our spreading Bays
To heaps of Nettles; thus, thus have we lost
Our former happiness, and heaven his cost;
Thus, thus, most obstinately all have run
Against the rocks, and vvilfully undone
Our stubborn selves; what hopes can we derive
From our imperious sins, that we shall thrive
In grace, that spreading mercy may incline
To do us good, and take us from the brine
Of our own Crimes; oh grievous is his end,
That lives, and sadly dies, without a Friend;
Oh sea of sorrovvs! oh tumultuous care!
What shall we do, to whom shall we repair?
We run from place to place, and are unkinds;
Never regarding those we leave behind;
Should heaven deal so by us, what were we then
But as w'areworst of sinners, worst of men;
What can we call our own? all things were sent
In mercy; and in grace they must be spent,
Oh grief to speak it! was there ever known
A fitter oppertunity to own
And use his blessings? know what is not used
In times of Charity is but abused;
It Is like the Israelites Manna if not spent
It will corrupt, and he that freely sent
Expects a free return; the poor man's hand
Is his Exchequer; do not doubtful stand
But pay in freely; and ye shall be blessed
With more then double, double interest;
And then your praise shall be recorded thus,
That Dives now is turned good to Lazavw!
Then shall the poor man's prayers and widows eyes
Prevail, and keep you from those miseries
Which may ensue; oh let not the advice
Of a poor sinner turn your hearts to ice;
But rather melt your souls into a flood
Of Love; remember whose most precious blood
Streamed freely forth on purpose to relieve
The poor; it was their sorrows made him grieve;
It was his grief that made our sorrows cease,
It was his bloody war procured our peace;
It was his glory made our darkness shine,
It was his Vinegar that proved our Wine;
It was his stripes that made us truly sound;
It was the Balsome of his bleeding vvound,
That eased our pain; oh here! oh here is the Cure!
But where is the thanks? it was he that did endure
But we that sinned; oh love exceeding measure,
His pain was the forerunner of our pleasure;
His stripes has made us whole, what need we more
But thanks? accept it Lord, it is all our store;
It Is a thin gratitude, thou art Divine,
Oh therefore turn our water into Wine;
And when dear Lord thy mercy is about
Such works of wonders, turn our insides out;
Oh heal our Leprosy of sin, and then
We Will boast that we are more then perfect men;
Thou that can Cure the blind, the deaf, the lame,
In healing us wilt get a double same;
For we are more then deaf, or lame, or blind,
Therefore (oh Lord) be unto us more kind,
For we have cripple consciences; each heart
Of ours is dead; oh raise them by thy art;
And let our eyes make such a sea of tears,
That we may walk upon it without fears;
And when thy judgment brings us to the brink,
Oh let us remember Peter did not sink;
And when thy Cock of mercy, Lord, shall Crow
Let Us turn about and weep away out woe,
And let us remember but the Cripples touch
And then oh Lord we will throw away our Crutch;
Oh let us remember but the blind man's sight,
And we shall come from darkness into light;
Oh let us prepare our hearts and then we may
Instead of running from thy Judgments stay;
And staying may most happlly embrace
The vvelcome glory of thy spreading grace,
That so our faculties may all combine,
To give thee praise that makes our visage shine;
Then shall we live in a most prosperous peace
Our Corn, and Oil, shall ever more increase;
Want, then shall be a stranger, to our Land,
And liberal mercy take off Judgments brand;
Then every one with freedom shall incline
TO enjoy the fruitful Fig Tree and the Vine:
Thus mercy shall appear unto our Land,
And lead in welcome blessings by the hand:
Then shall our joys increase as 'twas of old
The Wolf and Lamb shall Cabin in one fold;
Religion shall increase and bless our days
With sound Divinity; immortal praise
Shall fly to him whose mercy was so free
To own us in our great extremity:
Judge Reader, judge with what a pleasing eye,
The patient looks to see his Doctor by;
The Gally slave that ruggs the painful Oar
Rejoices when he sees a pleasant shore;
And shall not we that wander in our crimes
Rejoice to see illuminated times;
And let us (say whose lives are but a span)
With double admiration, What is man!
Lord what is man that thou art so inclined
To have him seated always in thy mind?
And shall we not return our thanks with prayer
That always make our miseries, his care;
Shall we whose sins do more and more increase
Beny, If we repent, a proffor'd peace?
Shall we that have a long time been at wars
Deny to put a period to our jarrs?
Shall we whose sad calamities increase
Deny to say thrice welcome, welcome Peace?
And shall not we (incompas'd with a throng
Of mercies) let Hosanna be our song?
Shall we be silent, and contented be
To eat the fruit, and not applaud the Tree?
Oh let not such ingratitude be laid
Unto our charge; oh let it not be said,
That we in times of mercy can be mute,
And kill the tree that gives us pleasant fruit;
Oh let us not, like sucking Children, bite
Our Nurses Nipple, let us not delight
In youthful vanities; oh let us not cry
Because we are fed, let not our deluged eye
Find quiet rest until our sins appear
Minute, like Atoms, in a day that is clear;
Oh let us, whilst it is to day repent,
And understand that Judgments often are sent
In tender mercy, zealous David found
Himself a King indeed when he was Crowned
With his affliction; Patience is a Jemm;
Saul seeking Asses, found a Diadem;
VVhist others, oh I pity them! Ah lass,
Looking for Diadems do find an Ass;
Our ancient Records tell us planly how
An Ass spoke once, w'ave many do so now;
By which we fully may perceive, what then
Were Miracles, are common now, to men.
Englands Tears.
STay passenger, and let thine eyes
Survey my ample miseries;
Stay, and give ear unto my story,
How I lost my former glory;
The mask of Judgment now does shroud
My visage with a sin-black cloud:
Sin has got the upper hand,
And Judgment rules in my Land;
My raging sorrows much increase
And I have lost my wonted peace,
Nor do I know which way to bend
My course; or find a constant friend
I am infected from my Crown
Even to my sole, the angry frown
Of Heaven persues me; and torments
My heart with sullen discontents:
My Soul is sick, my Spirits fail
And I am, to my self, a Goal;
Imprisoned in my sins I lie
For want of good security.
He that was wont to set me free
Infringes now my liberty,
Oh rashness! how am I mistaken,
It Is he indeed was first forsaken
That now forsakes; oh it is but just
To blow away presumptious dust;
Dust, so audacious, that it flys
Into the heedless makers eyes;
And to reward so great a Vice
He turns presumptuous dust, to Lice,
Oh tell me, tell me, what is worse
Then Egypts sin, and Egypts curse?
He whose mercy could not win,
Now justly scourges us for sin;
If sin will needs presume to rain
It must be crowned with grief and pain;
Nor is it fit a King should be
Without attendants: Misery
Is sins Lifeguard, there is no relief
Except it be successive grief;
When Judgment sounds a charge, what arms
Can save us from those fierce alarms?
There is no running, Horse, and Foot
Must be prepared to stand to 'it;
And when he sees his foes decline,
He gives the word; Vengeance is mine:
What weakness is it then to boast
Our selves against the Lord of Host;
Is It not a madness then to be
Soldiers without Artillery?
For if our Ammunition fail,
We are quite routed and turn tail;
Nay, here lies the greatest spite,
We Are most in danger, when in flight,
And so we shall both see and feel
Judgment can wound us in the heel;
But if we will avoid a Rout
We then must wisely face about,
And so we may by mild degrees
Conquer Heaven upon our knees;
The Gunshot of our hearty prayers,
Will make the Bull-works melt like tears:
We shall be Masters of the field
When true repentance make him yield;
Oh that plunder must be good
That is obtained with tears, not blood;
Will It not be a happy chance
To take and keep his Ordinance;
Oh 'twill be good to fortify
The Castles of our hearts, and try
The power of Satan, who will run
If he but sees a Heavenly Gun;
Though he loves fire, he proclaims
How much he hates those heavenly flames;
The way t'void so bold a guest
Is to keep flames within our breast,
And then we need not fear nor fly,
We may be wounded, but not die;
Nay, every wound we have shall be
The assurance of our Victory:
And if we chance to bleed, oh then
Let Us dress our wounds, and to it again,
Let Us neither face, nor wheel about,
Until we give a perfect rout;
Then, then, we shall be sure to lie
Guarded with security.
He prayed and the Plague ceased.
PRayer and the Plague are two most powerful things,
Being both derived from the King of Kings;
The Plague is sent to punish us, but prayer
Extenuates our grief; and crowns our care
With quick deliverance; for he that sent
His Plague, must give us mercy to repent:
He healed those waters which in former times
Received infection from the peoples Crimes;
Prayer is that Balm of Giliad which makes sound
A heart that bleeds it self into a wound,
A wounded heart heaven never can despise,
Wounds are best cleans'd with waters from our eyes;
Hark Reader, hark, what now my Muse resounds
We may want streams, but never shall want wounds;
Heaven bottles up our tears; let us deny
Our selves, and then those bottles needs must fly;
Fly till they have made more then Duc alians flood
(Who swims in mercy, cannot drowned in blood)
Let Us but remember the reward of Vice,
The very dust being turned into Lice;
The croking Plague of Frogs may make us know,
No sin can be exempted from a woe:
And since we have out-sinn'd that former age
We well may now expect a double rage;
Since multiplied crimes so much increase,
It Is Error not to bid adue to Peace.
It Is fit oh Lord that we should know that Air
Which is infected must be cleared by prayer,
If not, we must expect most fatal times;
For Judgments are still incident to crimes,
If we transgress, Lord, can we think that thou
Can look upon us with a candid brow;
Needs must we think out sorrow will increase,
When we unto ourselves will speak no peace.
Oh Lord, how more then desperate fools are we
That by our sins make open war with thee,
What Is our Artillery vvorth? our best defense
Must be thy grace, and our own innocence;
Oh give us grace, (since sorrovv makes us flee,)
To flutter from our selves, and rest in thee;
But thou art angry, Lord, how shall we dare
To came to thee that have lio cause to spare
Such obstinate offenders: Lord, how often
Have we abused thy mercies; nay, and scoft
At petty judgments; they that will not own
The lest of mercies, must resolve to groan
Under the greatest Judgment, when our sins
Has made us ripe, thy Judgment then begins
To shake the tree; which makes us rudely fall
And bruise each other to our Funeral.
But, Lord, if we can make it but our care
First to repent, it will be thine, to spare.
Oh Lord, we must submit unto thy powers,
Mercy is thy delight, and sin, is ours;
What shall we say, or do? all we can say
Is this; we'ave sinned, and we have no way
To shun thy Judgment; therefore we must flee
First from our selves (oh Lord) and then to thee;
But what are we the better if we fly
From our own selves unto an angry eye,
An eye that is so consuming, that one frovvn
Has more than power enough to cast us down;
Nay, cast us down so lovv, that we must be
In desperation of recovery:
But if we pray to heaven, his hand has power
To raise us in one minit of an hour;
And shall not then his glorious name be praised,
Oh let us think how Lazarus was raised:
Now Reader, give me liberty to make
A small digression; my own self must take
My self in hand, and to the world express
My thanks to him who in despite of ill
Preserved me (as I hope) to do his will:
'Tvvas so that fortune lately brought me down
So lovv that I was suuk, ready to drovvn;
But by a powerful arm he thought it good
In mercy, to preserve me from the flood:
And shall I then despair? no, let my Friends
Still gaze upon me, Job had no bad ends;
Though some rash words, Lord, let my sorrows be
Upon me, till in Faith I turn to thee;
Oh turn me, for indeed I am so weak
I cannot turn my self, nor can I speak
Till thou unty'st my tongue; which if by thee
Untied, my language shall be truly free:
The language of a sinner to his God
Pronounced in zeal impedes the powerful Rod
From lashing him, oh Lord, I truly know
Thy Rod is kindness rightly used, not woe;
Witness thy servant who (thrice happy) stood
Assured that affliction was his good;
And since 'twas so, oh give me grace to see
Being good for him, it must be good for me;
Affliction, like good Physic, must be sure,
To make us sick, before it makes a Cure;
Oh happy's, he that this grand truth can tell
He Is truly sick indeed, in being well*
Affliction's no disgrace, it is but a sign
That all the graces jointly do combine
T'administer the freeness of their will,
To part the grieved Patient and his ill;
And thus the inclining graces gently strive
To keep the impatient patient still alive,
That so he may with bounty give the Fee
Of humble thanks to him that set him free;
Suppose thou were impris'ned with the Gour;
So tortured that thou could not go about
Thy necessary business; would thou be
Ungrateful to that hand that set thee free?
Consider, would thou? nay, consider well,
Think once again, and having thought, then tell,
Tell what thou think; me thinks I hear thee say
Heaven bless that hand that took my grief away;
He healed me, shall not grateful I, advance
My Thoughts, and sing forth my deliverance;
Oh give me David's Harp, and David's Heart
Then will I sing his praise in every part,
That so at last I gravely may express
Full Diapasons of my happiness;
And when his mercies I have truly found
I Will run Division on a pleasant ground;
I le tune my self to such a perfect strain
That every Note shall ravish every brain,
That were old Orpheus living he should say
His Music was but discord to my lay:
Needs must that song be ravishing and true
When Heaven makes the Music, and Musician too;
Oh let me be well sounded with desire,
And thou vvilt play most sweetly on thy Lyre;
Thy sacred fingers will touch every string
With such perfection, that whilst Angels sing
Man shall admire in Raptures, and proclaim
Perpetual Hallelujahs to thy Name.
FINIS.
