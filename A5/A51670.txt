A PROPOSAL
FOR raising the annual Sum of 520000l, and not touch the prime Cost of wrought
Goods above one Farthing in the Shilling, nor be at any more Charge than two
Pence in the Pound collecting.

IN order to raise this Sum, I humbly propose, that every Master Weaver or
Undertaker for Merchants in this Kingdom, do pay one Shilling per Week for
every Loom employed by him; and it is allowed by the Weaver's Company in
London, that there is an hundred Thousand working Looms within the Weekly
Bills; and consequently all the Counties of England will produce an hundred
Thousand more:

The which 200000 working Looms At 52 Shillings per Year each Loom, Will
produce Yearly 520000l.
THAT this Sum does not touch the prime Cost of Goods above one Farthing in the
Shilling is evident, because every Loom does bring off as much Work in a Week
as sells for 48 Shillings.

THE which is most humbly offered to the Consideration of the Honorable House
of COMMONS,

By Samuel Myhill, Weaver, at the Sun in Spittle-Fields-Market, who is also
ready (if need be) to show a short and easy Way of collecting the same at two
Pence per Pound Charge, with prevention of Frauds and not troublesome to the
Trader.
