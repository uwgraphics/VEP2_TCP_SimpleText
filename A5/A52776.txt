Neighbors FAREWELL to his Friends.
NOw come is my departing time,
And here I may no longer stay*
There is no kind Comerad of mine,
But will desire I were ^way.
But if that time would me permit,
Which from your company does call.
And me inforceth for to flit,
Goodnight and God be with you all.
For here I grant some time I spent
In loving kind good company.
For all offenses I repent,
And wishes now forgiven to be,
What I have done for want of wit
To memory I Will not recall:
I hope ye are my friends as yet,
Goodnight and God be with you all.
Complementing I never loved
Nor talkative much for to be,
And of speeches a multitude.
Becomes no man of quality
From faith, love, peace and unity
I wish none of us never fall*
God grant us all prosperity,
Goodnight and God be with you all.
I wish that I might longer stay,
To enjoy your society;
The Lord to bless you night and day
And still be in your company
No Vice nor Iniquity.
God grant none of you ever fall.
Gods blessing keep both you and me
Goodnight and God be with you all
The Friends Reply.
Most loving friend, God be thy guide,
And never leave thy company,
And all things needful thee provide
And give thee all prosperity,
We rather had thy company
If thou would have stayed us among,
We wish thee much felicity.
God grant that nothing do thee wrong.
FINIS
