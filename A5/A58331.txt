A WAY UNTO TRVE Christian Unity: The worship of God in Spirit and in Truth:
TOGETHER With many Spiritual benefits therein received now in this life, and
everlastingly. All expressly delivered in the Holy Scripture, And declared in an
Exposition of a certain Fundamental portion of the Sacred Text. Written for
the lessening of Differences, and for the increasing of Concord in the godly
truth eternal. Also for to make more manifest a firm Ground, whereon holy
Unity may be built up, unto the highest degree of perfection, attainable in
this World.

Behold, how good and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together in
Unity.

Psalm. 133.1. But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth: for the Father seeks such to
worship Him.

requisite to be considered by every one at this present. Moreover the Reader
is to be admonished, that he do not 2 Pet. 2.12. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17.
condemn, what he understands not in this ensuing Treatise, remembering that
S. Paul says: 1 Timothy 3.16, 17. See verse 9. Ephesians. 3.4. Col. 1.27. and 2.2. 1

can well judge concerning the most high Mysteries of the Gospel, he is first
rightly to understand the Heb. 5.12, 13, 14. and 6.1, 2.
principles of the doctrine of Christ, as the Apostle signifies unto the
Hebrews. Who also gave the Corinthians for to know, that such as are but babes
or little Children in Christ, Cannot 1 Cor. 3.2. Joh. 16.12.
bear the strong meat of the word. And if such of the first age in Christ,
cannot Gal. 4.1.2. Acts. 1.6, 7. 1 Cor. 2.6.
comprehend all things belonging to the great mystery of Christianity; then
how can those, which are not Joh. 3.3. See Romans 12.1, 2.
changed in mind and conversation, according as the Gospel prescribes, (or are
not unfeinedly striving to attain the said change) judge rightly concerning the
most high spiritual matters, seeing that it is written: 1 Cor. 2.14.
The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned. The holy Prophet Daniel says: Dan. 12.10.
Many shall be purified and made white, and tried: but the wicked shall do
wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand. Ps. 25.14.9.12, 13.
David says: The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and He will
show them His covenant. The meek will He guide in judgment, and the meek will
he teach His way. It is written, that the Disciples came unto Christ; Mat.
13.10, 11. Isa. 8.16.
Why speak thou unto the Multitude in parables? He answered and said unto
them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
heaven, but unto them it is not given. Who also said unto His Father: Mat.
11.25.26, 27. See Joh. 8.31, 32. Wisd. 1.4. and 6.23. Sirach 3.19, 20. and

person how learned soever in Humane Literature, or in the history of Sacred
Writ, which is not entered into the true Regeneration, can Prove. 28.5. Mat.

the holy Ghost. Wherefore let us unfeinedly endeavor to become truly 1 Cor.

A way unto true Christian Unity.
Isaiah 40.3, 4, 5. See concerning this reading of this Text, what is delivered
afterward in this Treatise, and in the marginall annotations unto it.
A voice crying: In the Wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
straight in the Desert an high way for our God. Let every valley be filled up,
let every Mountain and hill be cast down, and what is crooked let it be made
straight, and the roughnesses become smoothness: and the Glory of the Lord
shall be revealed, and all Flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the
Lord has spoken it.
IT being written in the beginning of this Chapter, Isa. 40.1, 2.
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, says your God. Speak ye comfortably to

appointed time is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has
received of the Lords hand double for all her sins. Then the said heavenly
voice is uttered, to be considered most seriously, viz. In the Wilderness
prepare ye the way of the Lord, The former part of the crying voice is a kind
of figurative speaking.
etc. The which crying voice from heaven unto us, is in the former part thereof
a kind of Figurative speaking, signifying, That as if the greatest Emperor
were to go into a Wilderness or desert, for to make his abode there, he would

expect such like preparation for his coming: So Christ in His spiritual
coming to make his Joh. 14.23: Mal. 3.1. Psa. 101.2.

said crying voice is a portion of Scripture of most special consideration.
preparing to be made spiritually. Now this whole portion of Scripture, is as
it were a sum even of all the general doctrine of the word of God. And
therefore it is most diligently to be noted. Yea it is a See Luke 11.52.

In Mark. 1.1, 2. The said duty of preparation is signified to be the doctrine
of the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And therefore it is most
seriously to be minded. The late learned Casaubon said: Mysterium in hac
historia a propheta Esaia. olim praedicta, et tanto studio a sanctis
Evangelistis adnotata, latere aliquid majus suspicor, quam aut capere ipse
satis, aut satis queam admirari. In annal. Baron exers. 136.

The Title of the said portion of Scripture.


key of true holy knowledge: for who so does rightly apprehend the mind of
the Lord signified in this Oracle, he shall thereby through Divine help be
enabled much to perceive of the mystery, which is throughout the whole word of
God. And that it may be the easier comprehended, let meditation be thereon in
this order. First, to consider, for whom preparation is here prescribed to be
made. Secondly, in what place it is to be. Thirdly, the mentioned particular
works of the said preparation. And fourthly, the benefit which now comes in a
true endeavor to perform the same.

But before entrance be into the explanation of these points, it is meet in
brief to note the Title of this Fundamental Sacred Text. And literally
according to the Hebrew it is, A voice crying, or, a crying voice, or, a voice
of a Crier, the The Hebrew accent over the word for Crier, makes a comma: but
the accent over the word for wilderness is said to be one of those which make
an half Comma.
point of Distinction being made at the word crying. For so it ought to be by
virtue of the Hebrew accent unto the said word in the Original; It is also so
pointed or dissinguished in their Translation, Printed anno 1624. Mr. Tindall
in his Translation has there made the distinction also. See the Translation
used in the Reign of King Edward the sixth.
as in the annotation on this place it is delivered, which is unto the
translation set forth by Tremellius and Junius. Now this most great matter thus
from Almighty God delivered by Isaiah, is called a voice crying, to wit, unto
us in the name of the Lord, for to signify that every Mar. 6.12. 2 Timothy 4.2.
true Minister of Christ is a teacher of this Doctrine in effect, and fervently
presses the same. Also, as the Prophet Isaiah preached it, so did John the Luk
3.3, 4, 5, 6.
Baptist. Yea Mat. 4.17.
Christ and His Acts 20.21.
Apostles did in substance publish the same. It appears to be said Crying,
because the world is fallen into a great Isa. 56.10. Mat. 25.5. Luke 17.34. 1
These. 5.6.7.
sleep of ignorance: yea innumerable lie Ephesians. 2.1. 1 Pet. 4.6.
dead in trespasses and sins. Whereupon God commands every of his
Ministers, saying: Jsa. 58.1.
Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, etc. Also there is
said: Ephesians. 5.14.
Awake thou that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light. The first point* for whom preparation is to be made.
Let us now consider the first point, namely, for whom preparation is here
prescribed to be made. The Text says, For the Lord, For our God. And the name
here rendered (...) See Shi nalerus and Buntorfias in their Lexicons. at (...)
Lord is observed to contain in it the signification Was, Is, Will be. And so
in Rev. 1.8. and 4.8. even such an expression is delivered. And the name
rendered (...) ex (...), et (...)
God, is noted to signify a Mighty Being: and is here considered also to have
in it the signification of the blessed Being, in the Text in the plural number.
Trinity. And the word our being added thereunto, declares Him to be the God,
whom the holy Prophet enjoyed. And says David. Ps. 144.15. and 33 12.
Happy is that people, whose God is the Lord.

Now that this Lord God may be continually with us according to His gracious
Exodus 33.13, 14, 15.
presence, this Oracle instructs us, what we for our parts are to do
thereunto. But forasmuch Isa. 1.3. Ezekiel. 8.12. Ps. 73.27, 28.
few do understand, that the said presence may be enjoyed now, whilst we are
in the body, in this life, and in this present world: it is necessary to
endeavor for to help man's weak apprehension herein. God is every where, though
most mind it not. There is no place, where He is not according to his Essence
or immense Spirit. We are to believe, that thus God is. Heb. 11.6. Acts 17.27.
Ps. 139.

Nos vero omnibus [non modo factu sed etiam] cogitationibus et sermonibus
nostris, tum nocta n^n interdiu Deum adesse scimus: Eumque et totum esse lumen,
et quae in cordibus nostris latent videre. Athenagoras in legatione pro
Christianis.


Wherefore let there be first considered, that the eternal God (blessed for
ever) according to His Essence, infinite spirit, or immense Being, is
perpetually every where in the universal world. It is an ancient saying:
Enter, praefemer, Deus heic, and ubique, potenter. He says: Isa. 66.1.
Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. And, can any Ier. 23.24.
See Acts. 7.49, 50. 2. Chro. 6.18. Isa. 43.2.
hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him, says the Lord? Do
not I fill heaven and earth, says the Lord? There is also written: Wisd. 1.7.
The Spirit of the Lord fills the world: and that which contains all things
has knowledge of the voice. Wisd. 12.1.
Thine incorruptible spirit is in all things.

Moreover according to the aforesaid manner he is continually within every one
of us, although Job. 9.11. Joh. 1.5.
undiscerned by us. This incomprehensible God was unknown to the Acts. 17.23,
27, 28.

Prope Deus est, tecum est, intus est. Ita dico. Lucili, sacer intra nos
spiritus sedet, bonorum malorumque nostrorum observator, et custos. Hic prout a
nobis tractatur; ita et nos tractat ipse. Seneca ad Lucilium.


Athenians; and therefore Paul preached Him unto them, and signified, That they
should seek the Lord, if happily they might feel after him and find him, though
he be not far from every one of us. For in him we live, and move, and have
our being. And David has written almost a whole Psa. 139.
Psalm, for to teach, that the Spirit of God (Gods presence) was continually
with him, and that he could go no whither, where the Lord was not. And in
conclusion he said: verse 18.
When I awake, I am still with thee. When one duly considers, what has
operation within him, and becomes sensible, that in him somewhat Col. 1.29.
Prove. 1.23. Acts 7.51.
mooveth him toward the observing of the ten Commandments, and what else is
that everlasting Law of Almighty God, he then thus awaked, says with David:
Ps. 73.23.
I am still with thee, O God; and thou art Ps. 23.4.
with me. It is written that Jacob being awaked out of his sleep at a certain
time, said: Surely, the Lord is in this Genesis 28.16.

It is necessary to understand so far forth as it is in Scripture expressed,
what the eternal God is, according to His infinite Essence or being.


place, and I knew it not. But that this first point may yet become more clear
unto devout souls, namely, for whom preparation is now to be made, according
to the doctrine of this heavenly crying voice, there is also to be signified in
some wise, what the Scripture says; That the eternal God is. And so the mind
of man seeking the Lord, may be introducted to see (though as through a glass)
the Isa. 33.17.
King in his beauty; and to behold the Land that is very far off, as Jsaiah
speaks. The Lord Jesus Christ having said to the woman of Samaria, Joh. 4.23,
24 See 2. Cor. 3.17, 18. and the marginall reading there. (...). God is Spirit.
The hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the
Father in Spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him,
declares, That God is a Spirit, and that they which worship him, must worship
him in Spirit and in truth. Where he teaches us, that God is Spirit. S. John
says: This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto
you, that God is 1. Joh. 1.5. God is Light.
Light, and in him is no darkness at all. He also says: Beloved, let us love
one another; for love is of God: and every one that loves, is borne of God,
and knows God. He that loves not, knows not God; for God is 1. John. 4.7,
8, 16. God is Love.
love. God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in
him. So that here is plainly expressed, what God is, namely, that he is Light
and Love.

Now that this most blessed Spirit of light and love, may have his gracious
presence in us, to his Prove. 8.31.
delight, and our unexpressable Deuteronomy. 10.13.
good, His said crying voice is unto us, that we in our wilderness and desert
do prepare a way, and make straight a path for Him.

Now the second point is to be considered; to wit, The second point, In what
place to prepare the way of the Lord.
in what place the preparation is to be made. The Text says, In the
wilderness, in the desert. And what a spiritual wilderness or desert is, it
may appear out of the Apostles words unto the Ephesians, describing what they
were, before they became See Romans 1.5. and 16.26. Acts. 6.7:
obedient unto the Faith. He says unto them, Ephesians. 2.12.
that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and
without God in the world. But he describes a worse wilderness, in that his
exhortation, where he says: Ephesians. 4.17, 18, 19.
This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not
as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding
darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is
in them, because of the blindness of their heart: who being past feeling, have
given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with
greediness.

Now it is to be considered, how man and woman are become such wildernesses and
deserts, whereas in the beginning they were created glorious See Cantic. 8.13.
and 5.1, and 6.2. and 4.12.
gardens for the Lord. Solomon says: Eccles 7.29.
Lo, this only have I found, that God made man upright: but they have sought
out many inventions. It is said in Genesis: When the woman saw, Genesis 3.6.
that the tree of knowledge of good and evil was good for food, and that it
was pleasant unto the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took
thereof and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat.
Then became they to be Genesis 3.7. Romans 3.23.
naked in soul, and came short of the glory of God: They from being before Gods
gardens and paradises, now became to be wildernesses and deserts. And that
every one of mankind growing up in this world, and fast abiding in the fall,
not truly endeavoring to enter into the change of mind and life prescribed
and required by the Gospel, for to proceed duly in the same, is a Jsa. 32.15,
16. Jer. 4.26. Genesis 6.5. Romans 3.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
wilderness and a desert, it needs no confirmation with many Texts, being
acknowledged and confessed even by all. The Hebrew word for wilderness is
observed to signify a place remote from speech or talk. And in a settled
spiritual Wilderness there is scarf any gracious speech heard. Yea Christ
says: Mat. 12.34.35.
How can ye being evil speak good things? For out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaks.

The Wilderness within man, which ought to be prepared, is the heart: My
son, says God, Prove. 23.26.
give me thine heart. It is said concerning Rehoboam, That he did evil,
because he prepared not his 2. Chron. 12.14.
heart to seek the Lord.

But whereas the Holy Ghost does here use two words, wilderness and desert;
and the Hebrew word for desert, has in it the signification of In Ps. 68.4. in
the plural number.
heaven, may it not intimate the superior faculty in man, the understanding
or the mind? And then by wilderness may also be meant the inferior faculty
in man, the will or the affections. Jeremiah speaking concerning many in his
time, says: My people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish
children, and they have no understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do
good they have no knowledge. I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form
and void: and the Ier. 4.22, 23.
heavens, and they had no light. In which place also the word heaven appears
to signify man's mind or understanding.

The Heb. 4.12. Luke. 1.46, 47. Isa. 26.9.
Scripture has in sundry places the expression of soul and spirit to be in
man. But says the Apostle to the Thessalonians: 1 Thessalonians. 5.23.
The very God of peace sanctify you wholly: and I pray God, your whole spirit,
and soul, and body, be preserved blameles unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Preparation is to be made thereunto in the whole man: and as inwardly,
so outwardly also. And to the Corinthians he says, 1. Cor. 6.19.20. The Vulgar
Latin Text there has Glorificate and portate Deum in corpore vestro
what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the holy Ghost which is in
you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a
price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods.
Now the next point is to be considered, The third point The manner of preparing
the way of the Lord in us.
the manner of preparing. And it is first expressed in general, as, Prepare
ye the way, make straight an high way. And then the works of the said
preparation are expressed in particular, as namely; to exalt (or, fill up)
every valley, etc. The Hebrew word rendered prepare ye, is observed for to
import also, to See Schindlers Lexicon.
remove impediments, to void away out of sight uncleanness, etc. The Lord by
Malachi says: Mal. 3.1.
Behold, I will send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and
the Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his Temple. And the Apostle
having said unto the Corinthians: 2. Cor. 6.16
Ye are the Temple of the living God, as God has said, I will dwell in them,
and walk in them, etc. adds this counsel: Having therefore these promises
(dearly beloved) let us 2. Cor. 7.1.
cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God. So that the preparation does much consist in 1.
Joh. 3.2, 3. Heb. 12.14.
purification of mind and life. Also whereas it is said withal, make straight
an high way: and in S. John's Gospel the whole work of preparation is but thus
expressed, Joh. 1.23.
Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet Esaias; the Arabicke
interpretation of the said verb there, is not unworthy of some observation. It
says (...)
Make the way of the Lord easy. The said Arabian verb is interpreted also, to
make plain and convenient. So that for Christ's spiritual coming into us for
to dwell in us, to walk within us, See the Lexicon of Raphelengius
to solace himself in us, and to work all his works of grace within us, we are
admonished to endeavor, that his entrance and passage may be all manner of
ways delightsome unto him. An expressing of the preparation in particular,
namely in 4. sundry great works.


It follows, that the particular works of the preparation be considered: and
they are expressed in four great duties. But first, it is to be noted, That in
an ancient That which was in use in the Reign of King Edward the sixth.

See Tindals Translation.

See the note of Lucas Osiander on this Text.

See Isa. 57.14. Luke. 3.5. with Baruck 5.7.

The first work of the preparing.


Translation of the Church the verbs thereof are rendered Imperatively; the
which interpretation appears most proper, for that these four matters are
the duties in special of those two in general, namely, prepare ye the way,
make ye straight an high way. And the first work of the preparing is, that
every valley be exalted or filled. And a spiritual valley within us is want or
defect of somewhat, which ought to be in us toward receiving revelation of the
glory of the Lord. It is said Heb. 11.6.
He that comes unto God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder
of them that seek him diligently. So that unbelief appears to be a valley,
and is to be lifted up or filled up with belief. Luke 24.25.
We are to believe every word of God to be perfect truth, according to his mind
signified therein, though we for the present do not understand it. It is the
praise of Romans 4.17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
Abraham, that against hope he believed in hope, that he might become the
father of many nations: according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed
be.

But it was a dispraise to many of the Jews, that they believed not sundry
things written in the Law of the Lord, of which unbelief Christ taxed them,
saying: Had ye believed Moses, Joh. 5.46, 47.
ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his
writings, how shall ye believe my words? We are also to believe the Gal. 6.7. 1
Cor. 6.9, 10. Deuteronomy. 29.19, 20.
threatenings mentioned in Gods word, as well as the promises: because the Lord
is as true in the executing of them, according as he has denounced them, as he
is in the vouchsafing of the other.

Such unbelief ought not to be in us, for that it is written; Heb. 3.18, 19.
The children of Israel could not enter into the Lords rest because of
unbelief. Another valley within man is ignorance. Mat. 22.29.
Christ said unto the Sadducees. Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the
power of God. The Lord says by Hosea: Hos. 4.6.
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou have rejected
knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shall be no Priest to me: Seeing
thou have forgotten the Law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
Wherefore the Gospels commandment is to be timely considered viz. 1. Pet. 2.1,
2.
That we laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies,
and evil speakings; as newborn babes to desire the sincere milk of the word,
that we may grow thereby. Also not to continue still 1. Cor. 14.20. See the
Marginall reading there.
children in understanding; howbeit in malice to be children; but in
understanding to become men, perfect, or of a ripe age; Heb. 6.1. 2. Cor. 13.9.
Rev. 3.2. Deuteronomy. 18.13. Genesis 6.9.
Going on unto perfection, as is the exhortation unto the Hebrews.

And forasmuch as Christ has said: Joh. 12.48.
The word which I have spoken, the same shall judge us in the last day;
therefore (as says the Apostle) let the Col. 3.16.
word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom.

There is also the valley of fearfulness, namely of being fearful to begin
and proceed in that, which God has commanded to be done, and wherein he has
willed us to be 1. Cor. 16.13. Ephesians. 6.10, 13. 1. Cor. 15.58. Heb. 6.11, 12,
of a good courage. Such defect was in the children of Israel being in the
wilderness, when as they were to have gone on courageously toward the promised
land flowing with milk and honey, in confidence of attaining possession thereof
through the help of Almighty God, they then became fearful and faint-hearted
upon reports which some had made, as if the said land were not attainable. Yea
some said, Number. 13.31.
We be not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger then we.

The children of Israel then fell into murmuring and Number. 14.2.11.12.
disobedience, and so became to be in great peril of Gods destroying of them.
The Lord having said in the Revelation: Rev. 21.7, 8 The second work of the
preparing.
He that overcommeth, shall inherit all things, I will be his God, and he shall
be my son. But the fearful (namely, to enter into the spiritual warfare, as
it is enjoined by the Gospel of Christ) and the unbelieving, etc. shall have
their part in the lake, which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the
second death.

The second work of preparing is, To make low every mountain and hill. And what
such mountains and hills are, it is manifest out of the Apostles words, where
he says: Though we walk in the flesh, 2. Cor. 10.3, 4, 5, 6.
we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not
carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds) casting
down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalts it self against the
knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ: and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, etc. There is
1. Pet. 5.5. Job 41.34. Prove. 13.10. Isa. 2.11, 12, 17. 2 Timothy 3.2, 5.
a necessity imposed on us, for to strive against all manner of pride, which
the spirit of Satan, or our own flesh and blood may raise up within us. It is
Christ's saying: Mat. 18.3.
Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter
into the Kingdom of heaven. And then afterward signifies, That we are to
verse. 4.
humble our selves as they do. The Lord says by Habakkuk: Hab. 2.4.
Behold, his soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him. Jeremiah says:
Ier. 48.29.11.
We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and
his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. Moab has bin
at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not bin
emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore
his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. And therefore See the
whole Chapter.
sundry judgments are denounced against Moab. The spiritual mountains and
hills within us, will with Divine help become laid lower and lower, if we duly
consider the doctrine of these Scriptures following, and of such like: As, 1 Chronicles. 28.9.
And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with
a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts,
and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts, if thou seek him, he
will be found of thee: but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
Also that of S. Paul to the Corinthians: 2. Cor. 5.10, 11.
We must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, that every one may
receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it
be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.

Moreover that saying of S. Peter: 1. Pet. 1.17.
If ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to
every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. Also, David's
words: Lord, Ps. 131.1, 2.
mine heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise my self
in great matters; or in things too high for me. Surely I have behaved and
quieted my self as a child, The third work of the preparing.
that is weaned of his Mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. The third
work of preparing is, to make straight that which is crooked. David says:
Psalm 125.4, 5. Phil. 2.15. Prove. 2.15.
Do good, O Lord unto those that be good: and to them that are upright in their
hearts. As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead
them forth with the workers of See concerning equity and iniquity, what is
said in 2. Tim. 2.19. Mat. 7.7. Jsa. 16.5.12. 1 John 2.29 and 3, 10.
iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel. So that crookednesses appear to be
a kind of works of iniquity.

Now the ten Commandments are said to be the Rule of a Christian life: and
therefore whatsoever actions are contrary to the Moral Law contained in them,
are judged to be crooked; 1 Cor 6.9. Mat 7.22, 23. Luk 13.25, 26, 27. Jsa.
28.17. Lev. 6.2, 3, 4, 5 Psalm 119.1, 3, 6. Deuteronomy 22.1, 2, 3. Micha 6.6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13. Luke 19.8. Job. 20.18. Mat. 5.23, 24, 25, 26.
as also whatsoever are contrary to the said Royal Law contained in any part
or portion of Gods universal word.

Moreover as all unjustnesse is crookedness, so is all unholinesse. And
therefore two Scriptures are necessary to be continually remembered, unto the
making straight of whatsoever is crooked; namely, that of David: Blessed are
they that keep judgment, and he that does righteousness at Psalm. 106.3
all times. Also that of Peter: But as he that has called you is holy, so be
ye holy in 1 Pet. 1.15, 16.
all manner of conversation, because it is written: Be ye holy, for I am holy.
And God is holy perpetually.

The fourth work of preparing is, The fourth work of the preparing.
to make plain or smooth the roughnesses. And hereby is signified whatsoever
is not See Col. 1.10. 1 John 3.22.
pleasing to the spirit of Almighty God. (...). Luke 3.5. (...) in planitiem.
vide Lex. Buxt.
It is the Gospels commandment: Ephesians. 4.30.
That we grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed unto the day
of Redemption.

And therefore where the Apostle delivers this precept, he intimates sundry
roughnesses to be put away, saying: Verse 31.
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking be
put away from you, with all malice. And, Verse 29.
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good
to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. There is
as it were a little Looking-glass made by the Apostle, wherein every one may
see much concerning spiritual Prove. 18.23.
roughness, for to discern it, and to put it away: namely, in the Epistle to
the Philippians, it being said: Phil. 4.9.
Finally, brethren, Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are or
venerable; as it is rendered in the margent.
honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise,
think on these things: Those things which ye have both learned and received,
and heard and seen of me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

It is the saying of the Lord by his holy Prophet David: To him that Ps. 50.23.
and 84.11.
orders his conversation aright, will I show the salvation of God. And
whereas the heavenly crying voice is, That every valley should be exalted or
filled up, and every mountain and hill made low, etc.

It appears therefore profitable, to mention here together sundry valleys,
mountains and hills, crookednesses and roughnesses, which are in diverse places
of the Gospel expressed, to the end that whosoever endeavors preparation of
the way of the Lord within him, may perceive many of them, and may take notice
of all other, wheresoever signified elsewhere in any place of holy Scripture.
Because being steadfast, unmovable, always 1. Cor. 15.58.

Valleys, mountains and hills, crookednesses and roughnesses reckoned up many
together promiscuously, for to introduct a devout person to take notice of
them, and of all other signified by any holy Scripture. See 2. Esdras. 16.50.


abounding in the work of the Lord, they shall know that their labor is not
vain in the Lord, as the Apostle declares unto the Corinthians. The Holy Ghost
does oftentimes in many places of the Bible reckon up many such matters
together, to the end we may the more clearly know, what qualities, conditions,
properties, inclinations, affections, passions, natures, humors, infirmities,
and such like, we are to strive against. All Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
furnished unto all good works. The Lord Jesus Christ says. Mark 7.20, 21, 22,
23.
That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man. For from within, out
of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications,
murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil
eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within,
and defile the man. The Apostle says unto the Galatians: Now the works of the
flesh are manifest, which are these, Gal. 5.19, 20, 21.
adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings,
murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like, of the which I tell you
before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things,
shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. He writes to the Ephesians, saying:
Ephesians. 5.3, 4, 5 6.
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once
named among you, as becomes Saints: neither filthiness, nor foolish talking,
nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. For this ye
know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous one who is an
idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man
deceive you with vain words: For because of these things comes the wrath of
God upon the children of disobedience.

according to the crying voices prescription. Four things to be considered in
the handling of the fourth point.


thoroughly to search out it is our bounden duty, yea to begin from our very
youth this worshipping of God in spirit and in truth.

The fourth point is the benefit, which now comes in a true endeavor to
perform the aforesaid preparation. The Text says: And the glory of the Lord
shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

Now unto the understanding hereof there are four things to be considered.
First, what the glory of the Lord here mentioned is. Secondly, where it shall
be revealed. Thirdly, who shall behold it. And fourthly, in what manner it
shall be seen.

Concerning the first, what the glory of the Lord is, which is here promised to
be now revealed unto such, as prepare a way for the God of Ps. 135.2. Ephesians.
2.21, 22.
Jacob to have an habitation within them, it is manifest out of S. Luke to be
meant the eternal Son of God. For the Evangelist has expressed the promise
with these words: And all flesh shall see the Luke. 3.4.
Salvation of God. By which name Salvation Simeon also called Christ, where he
says: Luke. 2.30, 31, 32.
For mine eyes have seen thy Salvation, which thou have prepared before the
face of all people: a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy
people Israel. For Jesus Christ according to His eternal Divine Nature is the
supreme heavenly light, Joh. 10.30.
equal with God his Father. The Apostle expresses him to be the Heb. 1.3.
Wisd. 7.26.
brightness of the Fathers glory. And it is written in S. John, That he is the
true light Joh. 1.9.
which lights every man that comes into the world. Who also in every age
past has according to His Godhead appeared in some manner unto holy souls, as
Micah signifies, where he says: Micah. 5.2.
Whose goings forth have bin from of old, from the days of eternity.

And concerning the said spiritual coming for to continue whiles the world
does endure, our Savior Himself also testifies, saying: Joh. 14.23.
If any man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we
will come unto him, and make our abode with him. The Deity or Godhead of Christ
is by an ancient Justinus Martyr in dialogo cum Tryphone Judaeo.
Father thus declared: (...). That is, In the beginning (or, first of all)
before all creatures God begat out of his own self a certain rational Virtue
(or reasonable power) which also is called by the Holy Ghost the Glory of the
Lord, sometimes a Son, sometimes Wisdom, sometimes an Angel, sometimes God,
sometimes the Lord, and the Word. Moreover here by the Glory of the Lord there
may be understood also the Image of the glorious God, consisting in godly
understanding, righteousness and true holiness. The Apostle says: All have
sinned, and come short of the Romans 3.28.
glory of God, or of his image. And therefore he exhorts, That we put on that
new man, which after Ephesians. 4.24.
God is created in righteousness and true holiness: and is renewed in
knowledge, Col. 3.10.
after the image of him that created him.

And whereas it is said by God: Number. 14.21.
As truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.
And again: Hab. 2.14.
The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the
waters cover the Sea. And in another place: Isa. 11.9.
The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the
Sea. Therefore all 1. Cor. 2.10. See all Baruch 5.
knowledge of God and his will revealed in his word, may here be included also,
that it shall be more and more revealed unto his obedient people.

The second thing to be considered.
Secondly, There is to be considered, where the glory of the Lord shall be
revealed according to this promise. And whereas it immediately follows, That
all flesh shall see it together, it appears that the said Revelation is
within man. The Apostle says: Gal. 1.15, 16. See concerning the Mystery of
God in man, Wis. 7.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
When it pleased God, who separated me from my mothers womb, and called me by
His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the
Heathen, etc. And afterward he says: They glorified God verse 24.
in me. To the Romans he writes: For I reckon that the sufferings of this
present time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed Romans 8.18.
in us. Peter also intimates it, where he says: 2. Pet. 1.19.
until the Day Star arise in our hearts. Which Star truly is the glory of
the Lord, Christ according to His Divine nature, as Himself says: I Jesus am
the bright and Morning Rev. 22.16.
star. Peter also signifies where the Revelation of Christ is, in that
counsel given unto women, concerning whom he says: 1. Pet. 3.4. (...)
Whose adorning let it be the hidden man of the heart. It is in the Syrian
Text: Adorn your selves with the Son of man the hidden one of the heart. And
that Christ becomes to be within his people, according to his Spirit, is often
declared in the writings of the Apostles. S. Paul said to the Corinthians: 2.
Cor. 13.5. Col. 1.27.
Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be
reprobates? The Gospel teaches, that God the Ephesians. 4, 6.
Father is in his people, likewise God the Col. 3.11.
Son, and also God the 1. Cor. 6.19. and 3.16. and 2. Cor. 6.16. Romans 8.9, 11.
Holy Ghost: Hence it is said: Ps. 45.13.
The Kings daughter is all glorious within. Luke. 17.21.
The Kingdom of God is within us. 2. Cor. 4.6.
God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our
hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of
Jesus Christ.

There is thirdly to be considered, The third thing to be considered.
Who shall behold this glory of the Lord. The words of the Text are, All flesh.
And this is not meant concerning universal humane flesh, but only of that,
which bears in it the true circumcision the fear of the Lord. It is said in
Ezechiel; Ezechiel. 36.26.
I will give you an heart of flesh. And the Chaldee interpretation there is to
this effect, (...) Et dabo vobis c^rtimens coram me ad faciendum voluntatem
meam.
That it is such an heart as is in awe of God, and is inclined to do his will.

Also in a most ancient book of the Jews, there is a saying concerning what
presently follows circumcision, which being understood of the circumcision of
the heart, is a very memorable sentence:

(...) Zohar.
(...) That is: We have learned, that at what time soever, wherein a son of
man shall be marked with the holy signature of this sign; from thence he after
some manner sees God, and the holy soul becomes united with him. But Christ's
words do make the matter plain, where he says: He that has my commandments,
and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved
of my Father, and I will love him, and Joh. 14 21.
manifest my self unto him: So that saying unto the true Jerusalem; Arise, be
enlightened, for thy light is come, and the Isa. 60.1, 2.
glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover
the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee,
and his glory shall be seen on thee. S. Paul expresses the matter, showing how
God is perceived by his people, saying: 2. Cor. 3.18.
But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord. A soul Ezech. 18.21.

eye of the understanding being enlightened, it perceives what is the hope of
His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the
Saints.

The fourth matter to be considered, is the manner or (if it may be so
expressed) posture, wherein all shall see the revealed Glory of the Lord, which
labor in the work of due preparing the way of the Lord into them. And it is
said, Together. But the Hebrew word thereof seems to import as much as to say
See Schindlers Lexicon and Buxtorfs Sintaxis.
Every one together. Also the same word in a certain Psalm is interpreted for
to signify Unity; as where it is said: Ps. 133.1.
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together in
unity. Whereas therefore the promise is, that all truly holy ones shall see
together or in unity, it declares that Gods revealing of his heavenly light
extends unto Unity, unto the bringing of all and every one of them into
Christian unity of mind and understanding, and also into uniformity of life
and conversation, namely, to be more and more of the mind and life of Jesus
Christ.

For it is written: Phil. 2.5. 1 Cor. 2.16.
Let this mind be in you, which was in Jesus Christ. And it is also written: 1 John 2.6.
He that says, he abides in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he
walked. And to endeavor for to be in such Unity was the profession of the
ancient ones in the house of God, as it may appear from what is said, namely:
Walked we not in the 2 Cor. 12.18.
same Spirit? Walked we not in the same steps? Yea also S. Luke records,
Acts. 4.32.
That the multitude of them which believed, were of one heart, and of one
soul. It is the promise of God to bless his obedient people with the spirit
of Unity. He says: And I will give them Jer. 32.39.
one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them,
and of their children after them. He says also: Jer. 31.33, 34
I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I
will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more
every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for
they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says
the Lord. Also says Christ: Joh. 17.22.
And the glory which thou gave me, I have given them, that they may be one,
even as we are one.

Furthermore, as there is Zeph. 3 9. Zech. 14.^. Jer. 32.39. 2 Cor. 12.18.
Unity in observing the duties of the Moral Law contained in the Ten
Commandments; so is there also Unity in the most holy Jude 10. Tit. 1.1.
faith of Gods elect. The Apostle says, There is Ephesians. 4.5.
one faith. And he has these words: Ephesians. 4.13.
Till we all come into the Unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of
Christ. And as all which truly endeavor to make preparation of the way of the
Lord within them, according as it is prescribed by the aforesaid heavenly
crying voice, shall see more and more the 1 Timothy 3.9.
mystery of the Christian faith, and what the true Christian Joh. 8.12. Mal.
4.2. See wisd. 5.6.
life and conversation is, unto the increase of godly Unity; so such as are
Ephesians. 4.3.
studious of all holy Unity, shall partake of the greatest measure of heavenly
light, which God now communicates unto his servants. It is said in the Book
of Chronicles: 2 Chronicles. 5.13, 14.
It came to pass, as the trumpetters and singers were as one, to make one
sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord: and when they lift up
their voice with the trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of music, and
praised the Lord, saying, For he is good, for his mercy endures for ever: that
then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord. So that the
Priests could not stand to minister, by reason of the cloud: for the glory of
the Lord had filled the house of God. So it is said in the Acts of the
Apostles: Acts 2.1, 3, 4,
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord
(or, with one mind) in one place. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues
like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they were all filled with
the Holy Ghost. Then did God Acts 2.16, 17, 18.
power out of his Spirit upon all flesh; namely, on all ages and states, as on
old persons and young persons, on sons and daughters, on servants and
handmaids: and in great abundance on his Apostles, who had Acts. 1.4.
waited for the promise, and had kept in Jerusalem, Which (says David) is
builded as a City, that is Psalm. 22.3.
compact together; or, (as some translate) which is at unity in it self. For
where brethren dwell together in unity, Psalm. 133.3. Where there is such
concord: us says the Geneva note. The Ratification of this oracle.
there (says he) the Lord commands the blessing, even life for evermore.

There remains also, that something be said concerning the Ratification of
this Oracle, which is contained in these words, For the mouth of the Lord has
spoken it. The which words are added for to assure us, That our labor in the
work of the Lord shall not now be in 1 Cor. 15.51.
vain, our true endeavoring for to perform the aforesaid preparation shall
not be unconsidered. For God (says the Apostle) is not unrighteous to Heb.
6.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Mat. 10.41, 42. Ps. 19.11. Heb. 11.26.
forget your work, and labor of love, which ye have showed toward His name,
etc. And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence, to the
full assurance of hope unto the end: That ye be not sloathfull, but followers
of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promises. For when God made
promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, He swear by Himself,
saying, Surely, blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply
thee. And after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

Whereas it is said, For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, it gives us to
consider, that a mouth has uttered it, which Tit. 1.2.
cannot lie; and that the Almighty, holy, and righteous eternal Spirit has
promised it, which is Ephesians. 3.20.
able to perform it: Who has promised many spiritual blessings to be
inherited in the life that 1. Tim. 4.8.
now is: according as His Divine power has given unto us all things, that
pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him (as S. Peter 2.
Pet. 1.3, 4.
says) that has called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us
exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of
the Divine Nature, having escaped the corruption, which is in the world through
lust. That (as the Apostle writes unto the Ephesians. 1.12, 13, 14.
Ephesians) We should be unto the praise of his glory, who first trusted in
Christ: in whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the
Gospel of your Salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed
with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance,
until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his
glory. And as the Lord Jesus Christ says: Mar. 10.29, 30.
There is no man that has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the Gospels, but he
shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and
sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the
world to come eternal life.

Moreover, it is to be observed, that these words [for the mouth of the Lord
has spoken it] being so often used in holy Scripture, What the mouth of the
Lord signifies.
do in special manner note forth unto us the power and truth of God, upon
which we may build, and ground our selves, and be secure or See of Heb. 11.1.
the marginall reading
confident, that what duties we for our parts are to endeavor, are Ps. 19.7,
8. Deuteronomy. 4.6, 7, 8.
perfect wisdom to be done, and that the benefit signified to be received in
the doing of them, is most sure and certain. It is said in Ezechiel: Ezech.
37.13, 14.
And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my
people, and brought you up out of your graves: And shall have put my Spirit in
you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye
know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, says the Lord.

And to conclude this point, there is observed to be understood by these words
[The mouth of the Lord has spoken] Such a more inward manifesting and
communicating of the Divine will, as whereby matters were made known unto
Moses, as it is written: With him will I speak Number. 12.8.
mouth to mouth apparently. For so Isaiah framed not out of his own mind this
crying voice; (as Jeremiah says, That the false Prophets do speak a vision of
their own heart, Ier. 23.16.
and not out of the mouth of the Lord) but it being presented unto him by God,
he received it; and having received it, wrote it in his prophecy.

Also hence (as was before noted) the truth and certainty of the Divine promise
is showed, That God who has promised to reveal his heavenly and spiritual
light, unto every person truly repenting according to the crying voices
doctrine, will perform it so as it may be seen of every one in the Ephesians. 4.3.
Acts. 2.1, 2, 3, 4. (...) ab (...) unanimis; ex (...) similis, idem, and (...)
animus, quibus est idem animus, Pasor. Mat. 18.19, 20. Ps. 89.5.
unity of the holy Spirit of the Lord. And an example of all may be that in the
Acts of the Apostles, That when some which had been spiritual wildernesses and
deserts, and had heard Peter's Sermon, they were Acts. 2.37, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46.
pricked in their hearts, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles,
Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be
baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Then they that gladly
received his word, were baptized: And they continued steadfastly in the Apostles
doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And all that
believed, were together, and had all things common. And they continuing daily
with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat
their meat with gladness, and singleness of heart, praising God, and having
favor with all the people.

Now also having by Divine assistance thus explained the aforementioned
Fundamental portion of holy Scripture, there are to be declared Seven Uses,
Seven Uses, whereunto the heavenly crying voice is profitable. The first use is
unto Doctrine.
whereunto it is profitable. And the first is unto Doctrine. For this heavenly
crying voice teaches, that every one of mankind is under one of the three
spiritual states signified in this Oracle; namely, under Desolation,
Preparation, or Revelation. Whiles one is a wilderness and desert, he is in
the state of desolation: when one begins and proceeds in 1. Joh. 3.3. Ier.
4.14. Isa. 1.16.
purifying of himself, he is then in the state of preparation: and he that has
the Glory of the Lord revealed unto him in some measure and manner, is in the
state of Revelation.

Concerning the two first states there is no doubt made. Only question is
about the third mentioned state. Question or doubt only is about the third
mentioned state.
And that there is such a distinct condition spiritual, it may appear out of
these Scriptures following. S. Paul testifies concerning some of the
Colossians and Ephesians, that which is to the same effect, where he writes,
saying: Col 1.12, 13.
Giving thanks unto the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the
inheritance of the Saints in light: who has delivered us from the power of
darkness, and has translated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son. He has
Ephesians. 1.3.
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. and 2.6,
He has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in
Christ Jesus. David at last entered hereinto, when as he said: Return into thy
Psalm. 116.7, 8, 9.
rest, O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee. For thou have
delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. It is said in the
Apostle unto the Hebrews: We which have believed Heb. 4.3.
do enter into rest. S. Paul attained at length to say: 2 Timothy 4.7.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.
For they which fight manfully against sin, the world, and the Devil, do
through the Divine Spirit Phil 4.13. Romans 8.13.
strengthening them, 2 Cor. 10.4, 5

reigns not in their mortal body, that they should obey it in the lusts
thereof: but through Jesus Christ they being Luke 1.71, 74, 75.
delivered out of the hand of all enemies, they serve God without fear, in
holiness and righteousness before him all the days of their life. The said
third state is the 1. Cor. 13.11. and 14.20.
manly age in Christ: It is that which they enjoy, whom S. John calls 1 John.
2.13, 14, 20, 27. 1 John 1.3, 1^
Fathers. It is that state, wherein God is in some measure found and enjoyed. A
place in the Canticles makes it plain, where it is said: It was but a little
that I passed from them, Some at length in this world do attain to find God,
and to enjoy him in some measure, and manner.
but I Can. 3.1, 2, 3.4 Isa. 55 6. Ier. 29.13, 14.
found Him whom my soul loves: I held him, but I would not let him go,
until I had brought him into my mothers house, and into the chamber of her
that conceived me. A time was, when Job said concerning God: Job. 9.11.
Lo, He goes by me, and I see him not: he passes on also, but I perceive him
not. But at length he attained to say: Job. 42.5.
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye sees thee.
It is said in the book of Chronicles, That 1 Chronicles. 26.5. See the marginall
reading there.
Zechariah had understanding in the visions of God. It is also written that S.
Steven being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and
Acts. 7.55, 56.
saw the Glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and said,
behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right
hand of God. And such a spiritual sight he had, whiles he was living in His
body, some certain time before his death. It is testified concerning Zacharias
and Elizabeth his wife, Luke. 1.6.
That they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord blameless. The second use for Refutation.


A second Use is for Refutation of opinion in many, who think that their minds
can be well enough now, without endeavoring as this heavenly crying voice
prescribes. And therefore they will not Ps. 10.4, 6. Ps. 14.1. etc. Job.

meddle with any such meditation. Can the soul of any one be in a comfortable
state, which continues a wilderness or desert, having the 1 Cor. 2.12. 2 Cor.

spirit of the World (Satan) reigning with his power therein? The Apostle
says: Rom 6.16.
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your selves servants to obey, his servants
ye are, to whom ye obey? Can such be in a safe condition, which will pass
their time (as the Apostle says: d without Christ, being aliens from the
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no
hope, and without God in the world? Has not Christ said, But those mine
enemies, which would not that I should Luke. 19.27.

A Third use is for Correction of most persons, which pass their time in this

perfect wisdom. For it is the Gospels doctrine: 1. Cor. 13.1, 2. See the
Geneva Translation of 1. Cor. 13.2. and the Greek Text.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of Angels, and have not charity, I
am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling Cymball. And though I have the gift
of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I
have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not Charity, I am
nothing. It is said also else where: 1. Joh. 4.7, 8 8, 16. Deuteronomy. 4.6, 7, and
32.29. and 5.29. 1 Cor. 8.3. Joh. 15.10, 14.
Let us love one another; for love is of God: and every one that loves, is
borne of God, and knows God. He that loves not, knows not God, for God is
love. God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in
him. And what the said lovers nature and properties are, it is plainly
expressed in the thirteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians,
where sixteen qualities thereof are reckoned up, that there may be no mistake
concerning the charity or love, which the holy Gospel prescribes and
requires. The fourth use for instruction.


A fourth use is for Instruction; That seeing our Creator wills, that we Ps.
119.166, 174. 1 Pet. 1.13, 14, 15. 1 Thessalonians. 1.10. 1. Cor. 1.7, 9.
zealously endeavor the aforesaid preparation, and then wait for the
Revelation there promised; that we Jer. 7.5. Lam. 3.40. Consider the importance
of the Hebrew Text. See Junius his Translation thereof
thoroughly search and try our ways, and turn home quite unto the Lord, as
Jeremiah makes exhortation. Wherewithal (says David) shall a young man Ps.
119.9. 2 Cor. 13.5. 1 Thessalonians. 5.21, 22.
cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto, according to thy word.

We are therefore to consider all the word of the Lord, for to see what
valleys, mountains and hills, crookednesses, and roughnesses it does discover
to be in us, that so with help of his holy Spirit, we may put them all away
more and more. We are also often to pray as David did: Ps. 63.1, 2, 8. We are
to pray continually for Gods help hereunto.
O God, Thou art my God, early will I seek thee: My soul thirsts for thee,
my flesh longs for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; to see
thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the Sanctuary. My soul
follows hard after thee. Ps. 143.10. and 25.5.
Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God, Thy Spirit is good: lead me
into the Land of uprightness. Ps. 43.3.
O send out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me, let them bring me unto
thy holy Hill, and to thy Tabernacles.

The said work of preparation is not to be deferred.
Moreover, the said work of preparing a way for the Lord to come into us, is
not to be deferred until old age, or until there be peril of death or of
some great misery; but as the Holy Ghost says: Heb. 3.7, 8, 13, 15.
To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the
provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness. The Apostle there
says: Exhort one another daily, whiles it is called to day, lest any of you be
hardened through the the deceitfulness of sin. Continual observation
declares a certain counsel to be wholesome, which says: Sirach. 5.7. Deuteronomy.
29.10, 21. Romans 2.4, 5, 6. Ps. 119.59, 60. 1 Thessalonians. 5.2, 3. Maledictus qui
florem juventutis suae diabolo, et faecem senectutis Deo reservat, Augustinus.
Make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for
suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy security shall
thou be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance. Isa. 55.6.
Isaiah says: Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him,
while he is near. Christ says: Luke. 13.25, 26, 27.
When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and
ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord; open
unto us, and he shall answer, and say unto you, I know ye not whence ye are:
Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunken in thy presence, and
thou have taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not
whence you are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity. Hosea says: Hos.
5.6.
They shall go with their flocks, and with their herds to seek the Lord: but
they shall not find him, he has withdrawn himself from them. Wherefore the
counsel written by Jeremiah is still to be considered, to wit: Ier. 6.8.
Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee: lest I make
thee desolate, a land not inhabited. The fifth use is unto patience.


A fifth Use is unto patience, which (as S. James says) Jam. 1.4.
ought to have her perfect work, that we may be perfect and entire, wanting
nothing. The Apostle says unto the Hebrews: Heb. 10.36, 37.
Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might
receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he that shall come, will come,
and will not tarry. S. James also says: Jam. 5. 7,8.
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: behold, the
husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience
for it, until he receive the early and the latter rain. Be ye also patient,
stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws nigh. S. Paul says
unto Timothy: 2 Timothy 2.3, 11, 12,
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. It is a
faithful saying: If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. If we
suffer, we shall also reign with him. There must be a time of Ier. 4.3, 4. Hos.
10.12. Micah. 4.3. 2. Tim. 2.6. See the marginall reading there.
plowing, sowing and weeding, before there can be a time of reaping and mowing.
He says unto the Hebrews: Let us Heb. 12.1, 2.
lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let
us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the
Author and Finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him,
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of
the throne of God. Who also says: To him that Rev. 3.21.
overcommeth, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also
overcame, and am set down with my Father in his Throne.

A sixth use is unto Comfort. The sixth use is unto consolation.
If we lay to heart that whole crying voice, and faithfully endeavor to
perform the four prescribed works of preparation; though presently from
wildernesses and deserts we become not such gardens and paradises, as we ought
to be; yet let us remember the counsel of the Apostle: 2 John 8 Heb. 10.35.
Look to your selves, that we loose not those things which we have wrought,
but that we receive a full reward. God Almighty will stretch forth his Ps.
118.14, 15, 16. and 17.7. 1 Pet. 5.10.
right hand over us, he will stay us up and strengthen us. I will (says the
Lord) Ps. 32.8.
instruct and teach thee in the way which thou shall go: I will guide thee with
mine eye: For (says Isaiah) the Lord shall comfort Sion: He will comfort all
her waste places, and he will make her Isa. 51.3. and 31.15, 16, 17, 18. The
Seventh use of the heavenly crying voice is to show the way unto true Christian
unity, among all rightly fearing God. Concordia sustinemur, discordia pessum
imus. Anonymus.
wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord: joy and
gladness shall be found therein, thankesgiving and the voice of melody. The
prophet has written even a whole chapter, namely, the five and thirtieth, for
the consolation of such as do prepare the way of the Lord into them.

The seventh use of the said Oracle is, to show the way unto Christian Unity,
among all that truly fear God. But among some of mankind Unity cannot be: for
says the Apostle, 2 Cor. 6.14, 15.
What fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
has light with darkness? And what concord has Christ with Belial? Or what
part has he that believes, with an unbeliever? Solomon says: An unjust man
is an abomination to the just: and he that is Prove. 29.27. See Sirach 13.15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Prove. 13.10.
upright in his way, is abomination to the wicked. He also says, Prove. 28.4.
Who be the true fearers of God.
They that forsake the Law, praise the wicked: but such as keep the Law,
contend with them. Moreover, all are not true fearers of God, which say that
they are right fearers of Him. And therefore it is to be mentioned, whom only
the Scripture signifies to fear God rightly and truly. David says: Psa.
119.1. See the ancient Translation of the Church, as also the Hebrew Text. See
Sirach. 2, 15, 16, 17.
Blessed is the man that fears the Lord, he delights greatly in his
commandments. That is the sure and certain mark, whereby every true fearer of
God may be discerned from all other persons. Also Solomon declares, what is
the fear which God accepts, where he says: Prove. 8.13.
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil
way, and the froward mouth do I hate.

Now among all such endued with such fear of God, there is possibility of 1 John 5.1, 2, 3. 2 John 1.2. Ps. 119.63, 74. Luke. 15.7, 10.
Christian Unity, and that they will Isa. 11.12, 13. and 25.7,
embrace whatsoever may further them unto agreeing in the truth of the Lords
holy word, and unto the living in all godly love. And although among many,
which in a 1 Cor. 3.1, 3. What is promised by God shall be, ought not to be
accounted unpossible. Zech. 14.9.
good measure make conscience of their ways, there is so great difference in
understanding and affection, as that it is by some conceived impossible, that
they may by any means come into an holy concord; yet a saying of Christ may be
thought on, which is: Luke. 18.27.
The things which are unpossible with men, are possible with God. It is Ezech.
37.1. etc.
written that Ezechiel was set in the midst of a valley full of dry bones: and
it was said unto him, can these bones live? And he answered, O Lord God, thou
know. But he prophesying as he was commanded, there was a noise, and behold
a shaking, and the bones came verse 7. In the aforementioned ancient
Translation of the church, in Ps. 68.6. There is read: He is the God, that
makes men to be of one mind in an house.
together, bone to his bone. There was then a great beginning of Unity.

Let us most seriously consider, what says the heavenly crying voice, That the
Glory of the Lord shall be revealed unto all preparers of his way, and they
shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, who has power
to perform, whatsoever he promises. Isaiah says elsewhere: Isa. 54.13,
All thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the The said
word in sense implies Unity.

But your Ier. 5.25. Ps. 66.18.

He scatters the proud in the imagination of their hearts. But his Son

prophesied. Yea unto Unity works God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; Ephesians.
1.10. It is to be noted, That as in the beginning man and woman were created
in unity with God; so Holy Scriptures use is to direct us for to draw nigher
and nigher unto the same.

Hence it is, that Christ prayed so fervently for his people concerning their
true Christian unity See Joh. 17.11, 21, 22, 23.26.13.


That (as S. Paul says) in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might
gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and
which are on earth, even in Him.

Moreover, that the receiving of heavenly light into the understanding does
further unto unity, it may appear from a similitude. If a company be in a
dark room, where is very little light, and it has a table whereon is much
money, A Similitude for to show, that the true heavenly light, wheresoever it
appears, does further unto true Christian unity.
gold and silver, and some counterfeit coin be among the same; If they be
willed to take only all the current money, and thereunto to advise each with
other for the better judging of the same; and also be promised increase of
benefit, according as every one takes most of the said coin with none of the
counterfeit. Will there not arise some difference among them, concerning some
pieces of the money? Will there not be some conjectures amiss, because they
judge for the most part by supposing or imagination, and not by clear sight?
But if a window be opened unto them, and they have the true day light, will not
then the case be otherwise, and all former dissent in opinion about the said
coin much cease? So is it with us mankind: so long as we abide fast in the
fall of Adam, Isa. 60.2. Ier. 4.22, 23. 1 John 2.9, 11.
gross darkness covers us, as Isaiah signifies. Yea S. Paul told the
Ephesians, that they were sometime Ephesians. 5.8. Prove. 4.1^.
darkness. And the Prophet also speaking concerning such, says: Is. 59.10.
We grope for the wall like blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we
stumble at noonday as in the night, we are in desolate places as dead men.
The 1 Cor. 2.14.
natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned. The Lord Christ says: The Joh. 14.17. 1 John 5.19. 2 Cor. 4.4.
Spirit of truth the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither
knows him. Great is our spiritual darkness, manifold are our mistakes about
the things of God. Yea also we much differ in opinion concerning such matters.
But when as we hear the heavenly In Isa 40.3, 4, 5.
crying voice, and attend thereunto; when we open the Rev. 3.20. Ps. 24.7, 8,
9, 10.

give us light; he will open unto us such a spiritual window, and let such a
measure of true heavenly light shine into us, as that we shall judge more and
more rightly concerning all things pertaining unto Godliness. Also former
differences among us will more and more cease, and the unity of the Holy
Spirit will inwardly and outwardly among us increase. Another Similitude for to
show, how among all well-affected, the true Christian unity easily increases.


Hear also another similitude. Even as in an household, where all the servants
do faithfully mind the performing of every command of their master, and one to
help another for the fulfilling of the same, will there be any dissension among
such? Or if any should chance through any mistake, will it not soon cease, for
that none seeks himself, but every one only his masters benefit and credit?
So among all those, whose The mind of mankind for the far greatest part, has
as it were lost it self, in that it considers not the mark which the
Creator has prescribed unto it.
only aim it is, that our heavenly Masters will may be done here on earth,
Mat. 6.10. Romans 12.2. Ephesians. 5.17. 1 Thessalonians. 4.3, 4, 5, 6.7.
as it is in heaven; and The said mark, at which to aim continually, and
whereon to mind always in every particular matter, is in brief signified in
the before quotations. Mat. 6.10. Ephesians. 5 17.
thereunto do endeavor what may be, to help and set forward one another, will
there be any discord among such? Or if any difference does chance, will it not
soon be composed, when as none seeks his own honor or by-respects, but only
the honor and glory of God; None the doing of his own will and mind, but only
the doing of Gods Deuteronomy. 29.29. Acts. 13.22. Joh. 1.12, 13. 1 Pet. 4.1, 2. Mat.
3.15. Col. 1.25.
revealed will in every thing.

Such fellow servants will still remember, What is enjoined by the Gospel,
where it is said: Gal. 6.1, 2. See Phil. 2.1, 2, 3.
Brethren, if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore
such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thy self, lest thou also be
tempted. Bear ye one another burdens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.

Now hear some causes, why such difference is among some zealous persons, And
the saying is; That when causes do cease, the effects will cease more and more.
It is a great cause of difference, where there is minded but 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6,
7, 8. Causes of difference among many religious persons. The first mentioned
cause.
part of Christ's Gospel, and not the whole. Many only mind what Christ has
done for us; but nothing or very little what he Mat. 23.23. Micah. 6.8. Romans
8.12, 13. Mat. 5.20. Romans 8.4. Luke. 13.3, 5. Mat. 18.3. Luke 14.26, 27, 33.
Job. 3.5, 6. and 12.24, 25, 26.
requires to be done by us. It is true, we ought to learn every particular
matter mentioned in any holy Scripture, concerning what the Lord Jesus Christ
has done for his Church, and to understand the same according to the mind of
God. But withal we are also to learn every particular duty, which is taught in
any place of the holy Gospel, and with help of his holy spirit to strive for
to perform every of the same. Joh. 15.14.
Says not Christ, Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you? Did he
not charge his Ministers to teach all nations, for to observe Mat. 28.20.
all things, whatsoever he has commanded? Is not he the Prophet to be heard in
Acts. 3.22, 23.
all things whatsoever he shall say unto us? In all ages there has bin much
unity among all persons, which have as well minded every duty in life and
conversation, which the Gospel prescribes, as the matters which it signifies
to be believed.
It is still observed, that there is much unity among all such, as mind as well
what the Gospel teaches to be done, as what is to be believed: but among such
as mind only points of faith, and do neglect the matters concerning life and
conversation prescribed therein, the discord is much and manifold. It is
written, that the Angel of the Lord said unto the Apostles: Acts. 5.20. Joh.
10.10. and 12.50.
Go, stand and speak in the Temple to the people all the words of this life.
Which gives us to understand, that true Christianity for a great part
consists in matter of life and conversation. The Holy Ghost says: Jam. 1.27
Pure Religion, and undefiled before God, and the Father, is this, To visit the
fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
from the world. The It is in the ancient larger notes called the Geneva ones
See 1 Cor. 4.20. Romans 14.17. Romans 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13. 1 John 3.18, 19.
Geneva note thereon is: The true service of God stands in charity toward our
neighbors (especially such as need others help, as the fatherless and
widows) and purity of life. The parenthesis being left out, the sentence is:
The true service of God stands in charity toward our Neighbors, and purity
of life. Micah says: Micah 6.8. See the marginall reading there: also the
Geneva Translation of that verse. The second mentioned cause of difference.

Whereas many take no notice of the benefits, which the Scripture signifies,
that the truly godly do enjoy now in the body, within their souls and minds,
hence is it, that they hope for no such spiritual blessings now, neither
endeavor the prescribed preparation for them. And so setting not the said
spiritual mark before them, for to aim thereat, and to approach nearer and
nearer unto it, they come not into such a comfortable measure of Christian
unity, as others do. See Job. 22.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. And the
marginall readings there. See 2 Cor. 6.16, 17, 18. and 27.1. Rev. 2.7, 17, 26,
27, 28. and 3.5.12.


He has showed thee, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of
thee; but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to 1 Cor. 6.17.
humble thy self for to walk with thy God..

Another cause of so much difference is, That many bear not in mind the mark,
at which they should now aim, and hope for to attain unto in this life and
world: For the Apostle signifies, That Godliness has as well promises,
benefits and blessings 1 Timothy 4.8.
now to be enjoyed, besides what hereafter unto all eternity. And for that
those spiritual comforts are not now pressed hard after, minds become divided
and Ier. 50.6. Isa. 53.6.
scattered far apart. If archers go forth to shoot, and every one shoots
which way soever he adventureth, their arrows do commonly fall down far
apart: but if they all do aim at one and the same mark, then are they all
found about the mark, though some nearer to it than other. It is a mark whereat
we should now aim, to be joined Ephesians. 2.6. shows an high degree in Christian
unity, whereunto some of the Ephesians had through Divine grace then attained
unto the Lord, and so to become one spirit with him, as far forth as he now
vouchsafes unto his servants; If then I, thou, he, and innumerable more become
so one spirit with him, what discord can long continue between us then? The
neglect therefore of the study of attaining now Union with Gods holy Spirit is
a cause of so much variance among many, which yet notwithstanding have some
good affections and laudable beginnings. But all Wordlings bear the mind of
Number. 23.10.
Balaam. They would willingly die the death of the righteous ones, and that
their last end be like theirs; but whiles they live in bodily health and
outward prosperity, they are willing to retain within them the spirit of the
world, and to Acts 7.51.
shut out of their hearts the spirit which is of God. They consider not on that
saying of the Gospel: If we would have our souls long to prosper in our
bodies, let us not now shut out of our souls God the Spirit of heavenly light
and of heavenly love. Prove. 8.31.
If any one have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. Wherefore Solomon
signifies; That Christ's Spirit now on earth dwells in his gardens, as it is
written: Cant. 8.13. The third mentioned cause of difference, which ceasing,
true Christian concord will daily increase.
Thou that dwell in the Gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause
me to hear it.

The third cause (and that a great one) why there is such difference in
affection among many, is because that, which our Creator (blessed for ever)
has ordained to be the bond and tie of his people together, Romans 8.9.
is by many neglected or not duly endeavored; and that is Charity, namely, the
Charity which the Gospel has expressly delivered. The Apostle says unto the
Colossians, having exhorted them unto sundry great virtues: Col. 3.14. 2 Thessalonians.
1.3. 1 Thessalonians. 3.12.
Above all these things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectnes. And if
it is the bond and tie of the highest matters in Christianity, is it not
likewise the bond and tie of all inferior matters therein, Ephesians. 4.15, 16. Col.
2.19. Heb. 10.24, 25. 1 Thessalonians. 2.7, 8. Joh. 13.34, 35. 2 John 6.
That from the very Infancy in Christ there may be a comfortable growing up
unto the eldest age, which is in Him and through Him. If the sheaves of a field
be not tied up together, how can they be well brought home into the barn? So
among whomsoever the said bond or tie ordained by the eternal Wisdom, is not
put on, how can there be a good growing up together into the Christian unity?
S. Paul declared it to be his great Or conflict. See the marginall reading of
Col. 2.1.
care; even for all professing Christianity, That their hearts might be
comforted, being Col. 2.2. And in verse 5. he shows the power or effect of
the said knot, saying: Though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in
the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your
faith in Christ.
knit together in love, etc. He gives it also for a rule for every particular
action in this world, where he says: Let all your things be done with 1 Cor.
16.14.
charity. And hereon says D. Lucas Osiander, that famous Writer: Sixteen
properties of Charity expressed in 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6.7, 8.
Omnium actionum nostrarum moderatrix debet esse charitas, Charity ought to be
the moderatresse (or ruler) of all our actions. The Holy Ghost thus describes
charity, saying: Charity suffers long, and is kind: charity envieth not:
charity vaunteth not it self (or, is not So is the marginall reading of 1 Cor.
13.4.
rash,) is not puffed up, does not behave it self unseemly, seeks not her
own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil, rejoices not in iniquity, but
rejoices in (or, So is it in the marginall reading. See 1 Pet. 4.8. Prove.
10.12. Song 8.6, 7.
with) the Truth. Bears (or, i covers) all things, believes all things,
hops all things, endures all things. Charity never fails. There is
delivered lately concerning charity, that which is very considerable, viz. In
page 67. of the book entitled, The nature of Truth its union and unity with
the soul. Printed anno 1641.
Does not the Apostle, does he not most truly, most pathetically cry out?
Though I had the gift of prophecy, and knew all secrets, all knowledge, yea,
if I had all faith, so that I could remove mountains, I were nothing; I were as
sounding brass, and a tinkling Cymball, if I have not charity. When all these
excellencies meet in a Christian, as happily they may; yet it is charity that
makes him See 1 John 4.7, 8.12, 16. and 1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3.
what he is, and the other beeings are but as phalerae, as trappings which give
an handsome set off, but not a being to a Christian. In page 68. of the
aforesaid book.
Love is lovely in Gods eye, He is styled the God of Love, the God Love. And in
another place, the Scripture affirms, that in this we have fulfilled the will
of God, if we love one another; for by Here is declared, whereby union with
God is, according to 1 John 4.16.

The fourth mentioned cause of difference.


this we are made one with God, and so dwell in true light.

The fourth and last cause, which shall be mentioned at this present, why there
is so much difference among many, is, for that so few have any care at all to
understand their own way; and that the most addict themselves to judge one
another way. The Holy Ghost says: The wisdom of the prudent is to Prove. 14.8.

There is a way that seems right unto a man: but the end thereof are the
ways of death. Prove. 12.15.
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto
counsel is wise. David said: Ps. 119.24. See The margent there.
Thy Testimonies are my delight, and men of my counsel. Now the counsel of
the eternal Wisdom is, That whosoever would be a Disciple of Christ or a true
Christian, he do first of all betake himself to Mat. 7.5.

cast out the mote out of his brothers eye. Also to Mat. 16.24.

servant of the Lord must not strive; but be 2. Tim. 2.24, 25, 26.
gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient: In meekness, instructing those
which oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance, to the
acknowledging of the truth: And that they may recover themselves out of the
snare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. Also to Tit.
3.2, 3. 1 Pet. 2.17.
speak evil of no man, to be no brawler, but gentle, showing all meekness
unto all men. For we our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
hateful, and hating one another. Also to 1 Thessalonians. 3.12.
pray for to increase and abound in love one toward another Due notice is to
be taken of this Duty enjoined by the holy Gospel.
and toward all men, even as did the Apostles toward the Thessalonians. He
will then continually think upon that great commandment of the Law and Gospel,
that James. 2.8. Gal. 5.14. Romans 13.8, 9, 10.
Royal Law, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. What here follows is
aright to be understood, so as it may make against no everlasting Law of God.
It is meant concerning ones brother or neighbor, endeavoring at lest to live
in all common civility. But if any one do contrary thereunto, the magistrates
sword is to be considered. See Romans 13.1, 2, 3, 4.
To have a care to work none ill unto ones neighbor, but unfeinedly to wish,
and to endeavor (what may be) that all good, and all comfort, and all content
may come unto him, which one would unto his own self, in every particular case
of this present world. He will then see, that every one void of the charity,
which the Gospel prescribes and requires, (or does not truly endeavor unto
the Col. 3.14.
putting on of the same) is not in the Right. For the Holy Ghost pronounces:
He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, 1 John 2.9, 11.
is in darkness even until now. He that hates his brother, is in darkness,
and walks in darkness, and knows not whither he goes, because that
darkness has blinded his eyes. He that loves not, 1 John 4.8.
knows not God, for God is love. verse 20.
If any man say I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he that
loves not his brother, whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not
seen? The holy Prophet Malachy says: Mal. 2.10.
Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal
treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our
Fathers? He will then lay to heart that great saying of the Lord Jesus Christ,
viz. The Joh. 12.48.
word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. And
therefore he will seriously consider of these and the like sayings of the

judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yea,
he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. Verse 10.
Why do thou judge thy brother? Or why do thou set at naught thy brother?
We shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ. Verse. 12.
Every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Verse. 13.
Let us not therefore judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that
no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his brothers way.
James. 4.11, 12. Gal. 5.15.
Speak not evil one of another (brethren:) He that speaks evil of his
brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the Law, and judges the
Law: but if thou judge the Law, thou art not a doer of the Law, but a Judge.
There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save, and to destroy: Who art thou that
judge another? Also what David delivers, viz. Unto the wicked God says:
Ps. 50.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
What have thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou should take my
covenant in thy mouth; Seeing thou hate instruction, and castest my words
behind thee. When thou saw a theife, then thou consentedst with him, and
have bin partaker with adulterers. Thou give thy mouth to evil, and thy
tongue frames deceit. Thou sit and speak The Gospel requires, that we
duly speak against our own selves. 1 Cor. 11.31. Mat. 7.5. Luke. 6.41, 42.

have thou done, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest that I was altogether such
a one as thy self: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine
eyes. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and

the Holy Ghost: 1 John 3.15.
Whosoever hates his brother, is a murderer. Also what the Lord Jesus Christ
the righteous Judge has pronounced, viz. Mat. 5.22.
Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the
judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Racha, shall be in danger of
the Council: but whosoever shall say, thou fool, shall be in danger of
hellfire. I will forewarn you (says Christ) whom ye shall fear: Luke 12.5.
Fear him, which after he has killed, has power to cast into Hell, yea I say
unto you, Fear Him. Wherefore in reverence and godly Heb. 12.28, 29.

let us (according to the Apostles exhortation) walk worthy of the vocation
wherewith we are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long

the Spirit in the bond of peace. Let us be Ephesians 2.20, 21, 22. 1 Pet. 2.5. See

being the chief corner stone: in whom all the building fitly framed together,
grows unto an holy Temple in the Lord. Let us 1 Thessalonians. 4.18 Isa. 65.18, 19.
Isa. 66.10, 11.12, 13, 14.
comfort one another with the words of the Lord, concerning the great Unity,
peace and concord, foretold to come to pass in this last Time. God says by
Zephaniah: Zeph. 3.9.
For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call
upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent. He says by Jeremiah:
I will give them Ier. 32.39. Ezech. 11.19.

and of their children after them. Zechariah says: Zech. 14.9.
The Lord shall be a King over all the earth: in that day shall there be one
Lord, and his name one. Isaiah says: Jsa. 16.5.
And in mercy shall the Throne be established, and be shall sit upon it in
truth, in the Tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and hasting
righteousness. He says else where: The Jsa. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. Jsa. 65.25. also

Kid: and the calfe, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little
child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed, their young ones
shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the
sucking child shall play on the hole of the Aspe, and the weaned child shall
put his hand on the cockatrice den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my

waters cover the Sea. Unto the which God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Rev.
