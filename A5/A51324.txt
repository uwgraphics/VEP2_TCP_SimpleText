TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR JOHN LENTHALL Knight, Marshall of the King's Bench.
SIR,
IT is not unknown to the World, the great ear, earnest, sedulitie and
laudable custom that has always been observed in all ages for the
preservation of antiquities; by means whereof, the acts and occurrences of
former times are so clearly demonstrated, as if they were manifested to the
world by a perfect and lively representation, which affords in it self a
double profit, does thereby allure all well-disposed persons to the imitation
of those things which are honest and virtuous, and to the evitation of such
things as are evil and obnoxious, letting them thereby understand the happy
issue and success of the one, and the miserable and wretched end and event of
the other: for histories are as so many Records and Registers of matters that
has been already past, which being a thing that our humane natures are much
inclined unto, gives a great pleasure and delight in the reading: Especially to
those that are well affected to the same. The consideration hereof has moved
me to revive that which has for a long time been raked up in the embers of
oblivion. For there coming by chance into my hand a book long since printed,
the author whereof was that famous and learned Knight Sir Thomas Moore,
sometimes Lord Chancellor of England; wherein is set forth the short Reign,
and unfortunate death of the two young Princes, Edward the fith, and the the^
Duke of York his brother, with the troublesome and tyrannical government of
usurping Richard the third, and his miserable end, both which for the matter of
the subject, and the worth of the Author (who lived in those times) deserves
to be memorized to succeeding ages; which having for many years escaped the
press, and by that means likely to be utterly lost, I have thought it not
amiss to put to my helping hand, for the restoring of it to the world; and
because I know you to be a gentleman that delights your self in matters of
this nature, I am bold to crave your patronage herein, and that you would be
pleased to shelter it under the wings of your protect on, not doubting but by
that means, it will be as welcome to the world, and as well entertained, as it
has formerly been, which being the thing I wish, together with your pardon
for this my presumption, I humbly rest

Yours to Command, W. S.

THE PITTIFVLL LIFE OF KING EDWARD the Fifth.
THE Eternal God calling to his Mercy the Noble Prince King Edward the Fourth
of that Name, This Kings time with some part of King Richard the third, as
shall appear by a note made at that place, was written by Sir Thomas Moore.
Edward his eldest son (Prince of Wales) began his Reign the ninth day of
April, in the year of our Lord, 1483. and in the 23. year of Lewis the
eleventh then French King: Which young Prince reigned a small space and little
season over this Realm, either in pleasure or liberty. For his Uncle Richard
Duke of Gloucester, within three months deprived him not only of his Crown
and Regality, but also unnaturally bereft him of his natural life: And for the
declaration by what crafty engine he first attempted his ungracious purpose, and
by what false, colorable and untrue allegations he set forth openly his
pretensed enterprise, and finally, by what shameful, cruel, and detestable
act he performed the same; Ye must first consider of whom he and his Brother
descended, their natures, conditions and inclinations, and then you shall
easily perceive, that there could not be a more cruel Tyrant appointed to
atchieve a more abominable enterprise.

Their Father was Richard Plantagenet, Richard Plantagenet Duke of York.
, Duke of York, which began not by war, but by Law to challenge the crown of
England, putting his claim in the Parliament, holden the thirtieth year of
King Henry the sixth, where either for right or for favor, his cause was so
set forth and advanced, that the Blood of the said King Henry, although he had
a goodly Son, was clearly abjected, and the Crown of the Realm (by authority
of Parliament) entayled to the Duke of York and his Heirs after the decease
of the said King Henry the Sixth. But the Duke not intending so long to tarry,
but minding under the pretext of dissension grown and risen within the Realm,
and of Covenants made in the Parliament, not kept, but broken, to prevent the
time and to take upon him the Governance in King Henry's life, was by too much
hardiness slain at the Battle of Wakefield, leaving behind him three
sons, Edward, George, and Richard. All these three as they were great estates
of Birth, so were they great and stately of stomach, greedy of promotions, and
impatient partners of rule and authority. The 3. sons of Richard Duke of
York described.


This Edward revenged his Fathers death, and deposed King H^nry the Sixth, and
attained the Crown and Scepter of the Realm.

George Duke of Clarence was a goodly and well ^eatured Prince, in all things
fortun^te, if either his own ambition had not for him against his Brother, or
the envy of his enemies had not set his Broth^r against him: for were it by the
Queen or the Nobles of her Blood, which highly maligned the Kings Kindred (as
women commonly, not of malice, but of Nature, hate such as their husbands love)
or were it a proud appetite of the Duke himself, intending to be King, at the
least wise, heinous Treason was laid to his charge, and finally were he in
fault or were he faultlesse, attainted was he by Parliament, George Duke of
Clarence drowned in a But of Ma^msey.
and judged to death; and thereupon hastily drowned in a But of Malmsey within
the Tower of London. Whose death King Edward (although he commanded it) when
he wist it was done, pitteously he bewailed and sorrowfully repented it.

Richard Duke of Gloucester, The Description of Richard the 3.
the third Son (of which I must most entreat) was in wit and courage equ^ll
with the other, but in beauty and lineaments of Nature far underneath both,
for he was little of stature, evil featured of limbs, crooke-backed, the left
shoulder much higher then the right, hard favored of visage, such as in
estates is called a warlike visage, and among common persons a crabbed face. He
was malicious, wrathful and envious; and as it is reported, his Mother the
Duchess had much ado in her travel, that she could not be delivered of him
uncut, and that he came into the world the feet forward, as men be borne
outward, and as the fame ran, not untoothed: whether that men of hatred
reported above the truth, or that Nature changed his course in his beginning,
which in his life committed many things unnaturally, this I leave to Gods
Judgment. He was no evil Captain in war, as to the which, his disposition
was more inclined, then to peace. Sundry Victories he had, and some
Overthrowes, but never for default of his own person, either for lack of
hardiness or politic order. Free he was of his exspences, and somewhat
above his power liberal; with large gifts he gat him unstedfast friendship:
for which cause he was feign to borrow, pill and extort in other places, which
gat him steadfast hatred. He was close and secret, a deep dissembler, lowly of
countenance, arrogant of heart, outwardly familiar where he inwardly hated, not
letting to kiss whom he thought to kill, spiteful and cruel, not always for
ill will, but oftener for ambition and to serve his purpose; friend and foe were
all indifferent: where his advantage grew, he spared no man's death whose life
withstood his purpose. He slew in the Tower King Henry the Sixth; King Henry
the 6. slain in the Tower by Richard the 3.
saying, Now is there no Heir male of King Edward the third, but we of the
House of York: which murder was done without King Edward his assent, which
would have appointed that butcherly office to some other, rather then to his
own Brother.

Some Wise men also think, that his drift lacked not in helping forth his own
Brother of Clarence to his death, which thing in all appearance he resisted,
although he inwardly minded it. And the cause thereof was, as men noting his
doings and proceedings did mark (because that he long in King Edwards time
thought to obtain the Crown, in case that the King his Brother, (whose life he
looked that ill diet would soon shorten) should happen to decease, as he did
indeed, his children being young. And then if the Duke of Clarence had lived,
his pretensed purpose had been far hindered: For if the Duke of Clarence had
kept himself true to his Nephew the young King, every one of these casts had
bin a Trumpe in the Duke of Gloucesters way: but when he was sure that his
Brother of Clarence wat dead, then he knew that he might work without that
danger. But of these points there is no certainety, and whosoever divineth or
conjectureth, may as well shoot too far as too short: but this conjecture
afterward took place (as few do) as you shall perceive hereafter.

But before I declare to you how this Richard Duke of Glouc^ster began his
mischievous imagined and pretended enterprise, as apparently shall be opened, I
must a little put you in remembrance of a loving and charitable act, no less
profitable then pleasing to the whole Commonalty, if it had bin so inwardly
thought as it was outwardly dissembled, which King Edward did, lying on his
death bed, not long before he dyed. For in his life, although that the division
amongst his friends somewhat grieved and vexed him, yet in his health he less
regarded and took heed to it, by reason that he thought that he was able in
all things to rule both parties, were they never so obstinate: But in his last
sickness (which continued longer then false and fantastical tales have
untruly and falsely surmised, as I my self that wrote this Pamphlet truly
knew) when he perceived his natural strength was gone, and hoped little of
recovery by the arts of all his Physicians, which he perceived only to prolong
his life; Then he began to consider the youth of his Children, howbeit he
nothing less mistrusted then that that happened; yet he wisely foreseeing and
considering, that many harms might ensue by the debate of his Nobles, while
the youth of his children should lack discretion and good counsel of their
friends, (for he knew well that every part would work for their own
commodity, and rather by pleasant advice to win themselves favor, then by
profitable advertisement to do the Children good:) wherefore lying on his
death bed at Westminster, he called to him such Lords as then were about him,
whom he knew to be at variance, especially the Lord Marquess Dorset son to
the Queen, and the Lord Hastings, against whom the Queen especially grudged
for the favor that the King bare him, and also she thought him familiar with
the King in wanton company: her Kin bare him envy, as well for that the King
made him Captain of Calice, which office the Lord Rivers Brother to the Queen
claimed of the King by his former promise, as of diverse other gifts which he
received that they looked for. And when these Lords with diverse other of both
parties were come unto the Kings presence, he caused himself to be raised up
with pillowes, and as I can guess, said thus or much like in sentence to them.
An Exhortation of King Edward the 4. on his death bed.


My Lords, my dear kinsmen and allies, in what plight I now lie, you see, and
I perfitly feel; by the which I look the less while to live with you,
therefore the more deeply I am moved to care in what case I leave you; for such
as I leave you, such are my children like to find you, which if they should
find at variance (as God forbid) they themselves might hap to fall at war,
ere their discretion would serve to set you at peace: You see their youth, of
which I reckon the only surety to rest in your concord. For it suffices not
all you to love them, if each of you hate other: If they were men, your
faithfulness might hap to suffice, but childhood must be maintained by men's
authority, and slippery youth underpropped with elder counsel; which they can
never have except you give it, nor you give it except you agree; for where each
labors to break that the other makes, and for hatred each impugneth others
counsel, there must needs be a long tract, ere any good conclusion can issue.
And further, while each party labors to be chief flatterer, adulation
shall then have more place, then plain and faithful advice, of which must
needs ensue the evil bringing up of the Prince, whose mind, in tender youth
infected, shall readily fall to mischief and riot, and draw down this Noble
Realm to ruin: But if grace turn him to wisdom (which God send him) then
they which by evil means pleased him best, shall after fall farthest out of
favor, so that at the length evil drifts drive to naught, and good plain
ways prosper and flourish. Great variance has been between you, not always
for great causes: Sometime a thing right well intended and misconstrued, has
been turned to the worse, or a small displeasure done to you, either by your
own affection, or by instigation of evil tongues, has been sorely
aggravated. But this I know well, you had never so great cause of hatred, as you
have of love, because we be all men, and that we be all Christian men.

This I will leave to Preachers to tell you, and yet I know not whether any
Preachers words ought more to move you, then I that am going by and by to the
place that they alpreach of. But this shall I desire of you to remember, that
the one part of you being of my blood, the other of my allies, and each of you
with other either of kindred or affinity, which is the very spiritual affinity
and kindred in Christ, as all partakers of the Sacraments of Christ's Church. The
weight of which consanguinity if we did bear, as would to God we did, then
should we more be moved to spiritual charity then to fleshly consanguinity.
Our Lord forbid that you love the worse together for the selfsame cause that
you ought to love the better, and yet that happens; for no where find we so
deadly debate as amongst them which by nature and law most ought to agree
together. Such a Serpent is ambition and desire of vain glory and sovereignty,
while amongst estates, when he is once entered, he creeps forth so far, till
with division and variance he turns all to mischief; First longing to be
next to the best, afterward equal with the best, and at the last chief and
above the best. Of which immoderate appetite of worship, and the debate and
dissension that grew thereby, what loss, what sorrow, what trouble has within
these few years grown within this Realm, I pray God as well to forget as we
well remember; which thing if I could as well have foreseen, as I have with my
more pain then pleasure proved, by God his blessed Lady (that was his common
oath) I would never have won the courtesies o^ men's knees with the loss of so
many heads. But since things passed cannot be called again* much more ought we
to beware, by what occasion we have taken so great hurt before that we
presently fall not into that occasion again. Now be these griefs p^ssed, and
all is quiet, thanked be God and likely well to prosper in wealthfull peace,
under your Cousins my children, if God send them life, and you love and
concord. Of which two things, the less loss were they, by whom although God
did his pleasure, yet should this Realm always find Kings, and peradventure
as good Kings as they. But if you amongst your selves in a childs Reign fall
at debate, many a good man shall innocently perish, and he and you also, ere
this Land find peace and quiet again: wherefore in these last words that ever
I look to speak to you, I exhort and require you all, for the love that you
have borne to me, and for the love that I have borne to you, and for the love
that our Lord bears to us all; From this time forward, all griefs forgotten,
each of you love other, which I verily trust you will, if you any thing regard
God or your Kings affinity or kindred, this Realm, your own Country, or your
own safety and wealth. And therewithal, the King for faintness no longer
enduring to sit up, laid him down on his right side, his face toward them.
And there was none present that could forbear weeping, but the Lords comforted
him with as good words as they could, and answered for the time, as they
thought should stand with his pleasure. And there in his presence (as by their
words appeared) each forgave other, and joined their hands together, when, as
it after appeared by their deeds, their hearts were far asunder. And so
within a few days, this Noble Prince deceased at Westminster, the ninth day of
April, in the year of our Lord, 1483. after that he had reigned 22. years,
one month, and eight days, and was with great Funeral pomp conveiged to
Windsore, leaving behind him two sons, Edward the Prince (of whom this story
entreats) a child of 13. years of age, Richard Duke of York two years
younger then the Prince, and five daughters, Elizabeth, which by Gods Grace was
married to King Henry the seventh and Mother to King Henry the 8. Cicile not so
fortunate as fair, first wedded to the Vicount W^ll^^, after to one Kyne, and
lived not in great wealth, Brid^^^ ^rofessed her self a close Nun at S^on,
Anne was marrie^ to Lord Thomas Howard Earl of Surr^y and Duke of Norfolk,
Katherine the youngest daughter was married to Lord William Courtney, son to
the E^rle of Devonshire, which long time ^^ssed in either fortune, sometime in
wealth, after in adversity, till the benignity of her Nephew King Henry the
eighth brought her into a sure estate, according to her degree and Progeny.

This King Edward was such a Prince of Governance and behavior in the time of
peace (for in the time of war each must be others enemy) that there was
never any King in this Realm attaining the Crown by war and battle, so
heartily beloved with the more substance of his people, nor he himself so
specially favored in any part of his life, as at the time of his death: which
favor and affection yet after his death, by the cruelty, mischief and trouble
of the tempestuous world that followed, highly toward him more increased. At
such time as he dyed, the displeasure of those that bare him a grudge for King
Henry the sixth his sake (whom he deposed) was well assuaged, and in effect
quenched within the space of 22. years, which is a great part of a man's life,
and some were reconciled and grown into his favor, of the which he was never
strange, when it was with true heart demanded. He was goodly of Personage, and
Princely to behold, of heart courageous, politic in counsel, and in
adversity nothing abashed, in prosperity rather joyful then proud, in peace
just and merciful, in war sharp and fierce, in the Field bold and hardy, and
yet nevertheless no farther then reason and policy would adventure, whose
wars whosoever circumspectly and advisedly considers, he shall no less
commend his wisdom and policy where he avoided them, then his manhood where
he vanquished them. He was of visage full-faced and lovely, of body mighty,
strong and clean made: with over-liberall and wanton diet he waxed something
corpulent and burly, but nevertheless not uncomely. He was in youth greatly
given to fleshly wantonness, from the which health of body in, great
prosperity and fortune, without an especial grace hardly refraineth. This
fault little grieved his people; for neither could any one man's pleasure
stretch or extend to the displeasure of very many, nor a multitude be grieved
by a private man's fantasy or voluptuousness, when it was done without
violence. And in his latter days he left all wild dalliance, and fell to
gravity, so that he brought his Realm into a wealthy and prosperous estate,
all fear of outward enemies were clearly extinguishe^, and no war was in
hand, nor none toward, but such as no man looked for. The people were toward
their Prince not in a constrained fear, but in a true, loving, and wilful
obedience among themselves, and the Commons were in good peace. The Lords whom
he knew at variance, he on his death bed (as he thought) brought to good
concord, love and amity. And a little before his death, he had left gathering
of money of his subjects, which is the only thing that draws the hearts of
English men from their Kings and Princes: nor nothing he enterprised nor took
in hand, by the which he should be driven thereunto. For his tribute out of
France he had a little before recovered and obtained. And the year before he
dyed, he recovered again the Town of Barwicke against the King of Scots. And
albeit that all the time of his reign, he was so benign, courteous and
familiar, that no part of his virtues was esteemed more than those high
humilities: Yet that condition in the end of his last days decayed not, in the
which many Princes by a long continued Sovereignty, decline to a proud port and
behavior from their conditions accustomed at their beginning. Yet lowliness
and gentleness so far forth in him increased, that the Summer before he
dyed, he being at Havering at the Bower, sent for the Mayor of London thither,
only to hunt and make pastime, where he made them not so hearty but so
familiar and friendly cheer, and sent also to their Wives such plenty of
Venison, that no one thing in many days before gat him either more hearts or
more hearty favor amongst the common people, which oftentimes more esteem and
take for great kindness a little courtesy, then a great profit or benefit.

And so this Noble Prince deceased, as you have heard, in that time his life
was most desired, and when his people most desired to keep him: Which love of
his people, and their entire affection toward him, had been to his Noble
Children (having in themselves also as many gifts of Nature, as many Princely
virtues, as much good towardness as their age could receive) a mavelous
fortress and a sure armor, if the division and dissension of their friends
had not unarmed them, and left them destitute, and the execrable desire of
Sovereignty provoked him to their destruction, which if either kind or
kindness had holden place, must needs have been their defense. For Richard
Gloucester, by nature their Uncle, by Office their Protector, to their Father
greatly beholden, and to them by oath and allegiance bounden, all the bonds
broken and violated which bind man and man together, without any respect of
God or the World, unnaturally contrived to bereave them, not only of their
dignity and pre-eminence, but also of their natural lives and worldly felicity.

And first to show you, that by conjecture he pretended this thing in his
Brothers life, ye shall understand for a truth that the same night that King
Edward dyed, one called Mistelbrooke, long ere the day sprung, came to the
house of one Pottier dwelling in Redcrosse-street without Cripple Gate of
London, and when he was with hasty wrapping quickly let in, the said
Mistelbrooke showed unto Pottier that King Edward was that night deceased: by
my truth, quoth Pottier, then will my Master the Duke of Gloucester be King,
and that I warrant thee. What cause he had so to think, hard it is to say,
whether he being his servant knew any such thing pretended, or otherwise had
any inkling thereof, but of all likelihood he spoke it not of naught.

But now to return to the true History, were it that the Duke of Gloucester
had of old sore practiced this conclusion, or was before-time moved thereunto,
and put in hope by the tender age of the young Princes his Nephews, as
opportunity and likelihood of speed puts a man in courage of that that he
never intended. Certain it is, that he being in the North parts, for the good
governance of the Country, being advertised of his Brothers death, contrived
the destruction of his Nephews with the usurpation of the Royal Dignity and
Crown. And forasmuch as he well wist, and had help to maintain a long
continued grudge and heart-burning between the Queens kindred and the Kings
Blood, either part envying others authority, he now thought, as it was indeed,
a furtherly beginning to the pursuit of his intent, and a sure ground and
situation of his unnatural building, if he might under the pretense of
revenging of old displeasures, abuse the ignorance and anger of the one party
to the destruction of the other, and then to win to his purpose as many as he
could: and such as could not be won, might be lost ere they looked for it. But
of one thing he was certain, that if his intent were once perceived, he
should have made peace between both parties with his own blood: but all his
intent he kept secret till he knew his friends; of the which Henry the Duke of
Buckingham was the first that sent to him, after his Brothers death, a trusty
servant of his, called Persivall, to the City of York, where the Duke of
Gloucester kept the K. his brothers Funerals. This Persivall came to John Ward
a cret Chamberer to the Duke of Gloucester, desiring that he in close and
covert manner might speak with the Duke his Master: whereupon in the dead of
the night, the Duke sent for Persivall (all other being avoided) which showed
to the Duke of Gloucester, that the Duke of Buckingham, his Master, in this new
World would take such part as he would, and would farther wait upon him with
a thousand good fellows, if need were.

The Duke sent back the Messenger with great thanks, and diverse privy
instructions by mouth: which Persivall did so much by his travel, that he came
to the Duke of Buckingham his Master into the Marches of Wales, and presently
after with new instructions met with the Duke of Gloucester at Notingham, which
was come out of the North-country with many Knights and Gentlemen, to the
number of 600. Horse and more, in his journey toward London. And after secret
meeting and communication had between him and the Duke of Gloucester, he
returned with such speed, that he brought the Duke of Buckingham his Master to
meet with the Duke of Gloucester not far from Northampton, with three hundred
Horses, and so they two came together to Northampton, where they first began
their unhappy enterprise, and so the Duke of Buckingham continued still with the
Duke of Gloucester till he was crowned King, as ye shall plainly perceive
hereafter.

The young King, at the death of his Father, kept household at Ludlow, for his
Father had sent him thither for Justice to be done in the Marches of Wales, to
the end that by the authority of his presence, the wild Welshmen and evil
disposed persons should refrain from their accustomed murders and outrages.
The governance of this young Prince was committed to Lord Anthony Woodvile
Earl Rivers and Lord Scales, Brother to the Queen, a wise, hardy, and
honorable personage, as valiant of hands as politic in Counsel; and with him
were associate others of the same party, and in effect, every one as he was
near of kin unto the Queen, so was he planted next about the Prince. That
drift by the Queen seemed to be devised, whereby her blood might of right in
tender youth be so planted in the Princes favor, that afterward it should
hardly be eradicated out of the same.

The Duke of Gloucester turned all this to their destruction, and upon that
ground set the foundation of his unhappy building: For whom soever he perceived
to be at variance with them, or to bear toward himself any favor, he brake
unto them, some by mouth, some by writing and secret messengers, that it was
neither reason, nor yet to be suffered, that the young King their Master and
kinsman should be in the hands and custody of his Mothers kindred, sequestered
in manner from their company and attendance, of which every one ought him as
faithful service as they, and many of them of far^ more honorable part of kin
then his Mothers side, whose blood, quoth the Duke of Gloucester, saving the
Kings pleasure, was far unmeet to be matched with his, which now to be
removed from the King, and the least Noble to be left about him, is, quoth he,
neither honorable to his Majesty, nor to us, and also to him less surety, to
have his Nobles and mightiest of his friends from him, and to us all no little
danger to suffer, and especially our ill willers to grow into great authority
with the King in youth, namely, which is light of belief and soon persuaded.

Ye remember, that King Edward himself, albeit he was both of age and
discretion, yet was he ruled in many things by that faction, more then stood
there with his honor, or our profit, or with the commodity of any man else,
except only the immoderate advancement of themselves, which whether they
thirsted sore after their own weal or no, it were hard I think to guess.
And if some folks friendship had not holden better place with the King, then
any respect of kindred, they might, peradventure, easily have trapped and
brought to confusion some of us ere this; and why not as easily as they have
done others, or this as near of the Blood Royal, but our Lord has wrought
his will, and thanked be his grace, that peril is past: howbeit* as great is
growing, if we suffer this young King in his enemies hands which without his
witting might abuse the name of his commandment to any of our undoing; which
things, God and our good provision forbid; of which good provision, none of us
have any thing the less need for the late atonement made, in which the Kings
pleasure had more place then the parties hearts or wills, nor none of us is so
unwise, or so much overseene, as to trust a new friend made of an old foe, or
to think that any only kindness so suddenly contracted in an hour,
continued scantly yet a fortnight, should be deeper set in our stomachs then a
long accustomed malice many years rooted.

With these persuasions and writings, the Duke of Gloucester set on fire them
which were easy to kindle, and especially two, Henry Duke of Buckingham, and
William Lord Hastings, and Lord Chamberlain, both men of honor and of great
power, the one by long succession from his Ancestors, the other by his Offices
and the Kings favor. These two not bearing each to other so much love, as
hatred both to the Queens blood, accorded together with the Duke of
Gloucester, that they would remove from the King all his Mothers friends, under
the name of their enemies.

Whereupon the Duke of Gloucester, being advertised that the Lords about the
King intended to bring him to London to his Coronation, accompanied with such a
number of their friends, that it should be hard for him to bring his purpose to
pass, without the assembling and gathering of people, and in manner of open
war, whereof the end he knew was doubtful, and in the which the King being on
the other side, his part should have the name and face of Rebellion:

He secretly therefore by diverse means, caused the Queen to be pe^swaded,
that it was neither need, and should also be dangerous for the King to come up
so strong; for as now, every Lord loved other, and no other thing studied for,
but the triumph of his Coronation, and honor of the King. And if the Lords
about the King should assemble, in the Kings name, much people, they should
give the Lords betwixt whom and them there had been some time debate, an
occasion to fear and suspect, lest they should gather this people, not for the
Kings safeguard, whom no man impugned, but for their destruction, having more
regard to their old variance, then to their new atonement; for the which cause,
they on the other part might assemble men also for their defense, whose powers
she knew well stretched far; and thus should all the Realm fall in an
uproare, and of the mischief that thereof should ensue (which was likely to be
not a little) the most harm was like to fall where she least would, and then
all the World would put her and her kindred in the blame; saying, That they had
unwisely and untruly broken the amity and peace, which the King her Husband had
so prudently made between her kindred and his, which amity his Kin had
always observed.

The Queen being thus persuaded, sent word to the King and to her Brother,
that there was no cause nor need to assemble any peope, and also the Duke of
Gloucester and other Lords of his side, wrote unto the King so reverently, and
to the Queens friends there so lovingly, that they nothing earthly
mistrusting, brought the King toward London with a sober company in great haste
(but not in good speed) till he came to Northampton, and from thence he
removed to Stony Stratford. On which day, the two Dukes and their train came
to Northampton, faigning that Stony Stratford could not lodge them all, where
they found the Earl Rivers, intending the next morning to have followed the
King, and to be with him early in the morning. So that night, the Dukes made
to the Earl Rivers friendly cheer, but as soon as they were departed, very
familiar, with great courtesy in open sight, and the Earl Rivers lodged, the
two Dukes with a few of their privy friends fell to Council, wherein they
spent a great part of the night, and in the dawning of the day, they sent about
privily to their servants in their lodgings, to haste to horseback, for their
Lords were in manner ready to ride, whereupon all their servants were ready ere
the Lord Rivers servants were awake. Now had the Dukes taken the keys of the
Inn into their possession, so that none should issue out without their
consent. And over this in the high way toward Stony Stratford, they set
certain of their folks that should cause and compel to return again all
persons that were passing from Northampton to Stony Stratford, saying that the
Dukes themselves would be the first that should come to the King from
Northampton: thus they bare folks in hand. But when the Earl Rivers understood
the Gates closed, and the ways on every side beset, neither his servants,
neither himself suffered to go out, perceiving so great a thing without his
knowledge, not begun for naught, comparing this present doing with the last
nights cheer, in so few hours so great a change, marvellously misliked it.
Howbeit, since he could not get away, he determined not to keep himself
close, lest he should seem to hide himself for some secret fear of his own
fault, whereof he saw no such cause in himself; wherefore on the surety of his
own conscience he determined to go to them, and to inquire what this matter
might mean: Whom as soon as they saw, they began to quarrel with him,
affirming that he pretended to set distance between the King and them, to
bring them to confusion, which should not lie in his power; and when he began,
as he was an eloquent and well-spoken man, in goodly wise to excuse himself,
they would not hear his answer, but took him by force and put him in ward.
And then they mounted on horseback and came in haste to Stony Stratford, where
the King was going to horseback, because he would leave the lodging for them,
for it was too straight for both the companies. And when they came to his
presence, they alighted and their company about them, and on their knees
saluted him, and he them gently received, nothing earthly knowing nor
mistrusting as yet. The Duke of Buckingham said aloud, On before Gentlemen, and
Yeomen keep your rooms, and therewith in the Kings presence they picked a
quarrel to the Lord Richard Gray the Queens son, and Brother to the Lord
Marquess, and half Brother to the King, saying, that he and the Marquess
his Brother, and the Lord Rivers his Uncle, had compassed to rule the King and
the Realm, and set variance between the estates, and to subdue and destroy
the Noble Blood of the Realm. And toward the accomplishment of the same, they
said, the Lord Marquess had entered into the Tower of London, and thence had
taken out treasure, and sent men to the Sea, which things these Dukes knew well
were done for a good purpose, and as very necessary, appointed by the whole
Counsel at London, but somewhat they must say: Unto the which words the king
answered, what my Brother Marquess has done, I cannot say, but in good faith,
I dare well answer for my Uncle Rivers and my Brother here, that they be
innocent of such matters. Yea, my Liege, quoth the Duke of Buckingham, they
have kept the dealing of these matters far from the knowledge of your good
Grace. And forthwith they arrested the Lord Richard and Sir Thomas Vaughan,
and Sir Richard Hawte, knights, in the Kings presence, and brought the King and
all back to Northampton, where they took farther counsel in their affairs.
And there they sent from the King whom it pleased them, and set about him such
servants as better pleased them then him. At which dealing he wept and was not
content, but it booted not. And at dinner, the Duke of Gloucester sent a dish
from his own Table to the Lord Rivers* praying him to be of good cheer, and
all should be well: he thanked him, and prayed the Messenger to bear it to
his Nephew the Lord Richard with like words, whom he knew to have need of
comfort, as one to whom such adversity was strange, but he himself had been
always enured therewith, and therefore could bear it the better. But for all
this message, the Duke of Gloucester sent the Lord Rivers, the Lord Richard and
Sir Thomas Vaughan, and Sir Richard Hawte into the North parts into diverse
prisons, but at last, all came to Pomfret, where they all four were beheaded
without judgment.

In this manner as you have heard, the Duke of Gloucester took on him the
Governance of the young King, whom with much reverence he conveyed toward
London. These tidings came hastily to the Queen before midnight, by a very
sore report, that the King her son was taken, and that her Brother and her
other son, and other her friends were arrested and sent, no man knew whither.
With this heavy tidings the Queen bewailed her child's ruin, her friends
mischance, and her own misfortune, cursing the time that ever she was
persuaded to leave the gathering of people to bring up the King with a great
power, but that was passed, and therefore now she took her younger son, the
Duke of York, and her daughter, and went out of the Palace of Westminster into
the Sanctuary, and there lodged in the Abbots place, and she and all her
children and company were registered for Sanctuary persons. The same night there
came to Doctor Rotheram Archbishop of York, and Lord Chancelour, a messenger
from the Lord Chamberlain to York place beside Westminster; the Messenger was
brought to the Bishops Bed side, and declared to him that the Dukes were gone
back with the young King to Northampton, and declared further, that the Lord
Hastings his master sent him word, that he should fear nothing, for all
should be well. Well, (quoth the Archbishop) be it as well as it will, it will
never be so well as we have seen it, and then the messenger departed.
Whereupon the Bishop called up all his servants, and took with him the great
Seal, and came before day to the Queen, about whom he found much heaviness,
rumble, haste, business, conveyance and carriage of her stuff into Sanctuary;
every man was busy to carry* bear and convey stuff, chests and fardels, no
man was unoccupied, and some carried more then they were commanded to another
place.

The Queen sat alone below on the Rushes all desolate and dismayed, whom the
Archbishop comforted in the best manner that he could, showing her, that the
matter was nothing so sore as she took it for, and that he was put in good
hope and out fear by the message sent to him from the Lord Hastings. A woe
worth him, quoth the Queen, for it is he that goes about to destroy me and
my blood. Madame, quoth he, be of good comfort, and I assure you, if they
crown any other King then your son, whom they now have, we shall on the
morrow crown his Brother, whom you have here with you. And here is the Great
Seal, which in likewise as your Noble Husband delivered it to me, so I
deliver it to you, to the use of your Son, and therewith delivered her the
Great Seal, and departed home in the dawning of the day. And when he opened
his windows and looked on the Thames, he might see the River full of Boats,
of the Duke of Gloucester his servants watching, that no person should go to
Sanctuary, nor none should pass unsearched.

Then was there great rumor and commotion in the City, and in other places,
the people diversely divined upon this dealing. And diverse Lords, Knights and
Gentlemen, either for favor of the Queen, or for fear of themselves,
assembled companies, and went stocking together in harness. And many also, for
that they recounted this demanour attempted, not so specially against other
Lords, as against the King himself, in disturbance of his Coronation,
therefore they assembled by and by together, to commune of this matter at
London. The Archbishop of York, fearing that it would be ascribed (as it was
indeed) to overmuch lightness, that he so suddenly had yielded up the Great
Seal to the Queen, to whom the custody thereof nothing appertained without
especial commandment of the King, secretly sent for the Seal again, and
brought it with him, after the accustomed manner, to meet with the Lords.

At this meeting, the Lord Hastings, whose truth toward the King no man
doubted, no^ needed to doubt, persuaded the Lords to believe, that the Duke of
Gloucester was faithful and sure toward his Prince, and that the Lord Rivers,
the Lord Richard, and other Knights apprehended, were for matters attempted by
them against the Dukes of Gloucester and Buckingham, put under arrest, for
their surety, and not for the Kings danger, and that they were also in
safeguard there to remain, till the matter were (not by the Dukes only) but
also by all the other Lords of the Kings Counsel indifferently examined, and
by their discretions ordered, and either judged or appeased. And one thing he
advised them to beware of, that they judged not the matter too far forth ere
they knew the truth, nor turning their private grudges into the common hurt,
irriting and provoking men unto anger; and disturbing the Kings Coronation,
toward which the Dukes were coming, for that, then might peradventure bring
the matter so far out of joint, that it should never be brought in frame
again, which if it should hap as it were likely to come to a field, though all
parties were in all other things equal, yet should the authority be on that
side, where the King is himself; with these persuasions of the Lord Hastings,
whereof part he himself believed, and of part he knew well the contrary,
these commotions were somewhat appeased. But especially, because the Dukes of
Buckingham and Gloucester were so near, and came on ^o shortly with the King,
in no other manner, nor no other voice or semblance then to his Coronation,
causing the ^ame to be blown about, that such persons as were apprehended, had
contrived the destruction of the Dukes of Gloucester and of Buckingham, and
other of the Noble Blood of this Realm, to the intent that they alone would
rule and govern the King. And for the color thereof, such of the Dukes
servants as rod with the Carts of their stuff which was taken, among the which
stuff, no marvel though some were harness, which at the breaking up of such
an household must be brought away or cast away, they showed to the people, and
as they went, said, Lo, here be the Barrels of harness that these Traitors had
privily conveyed in their carriages to destroy the Noble Lords withal. This
diverse, (although it made the matter to wise men more unlikely) well perceiving
that the intenders of such a purpose, would rather have had their harness on
their backs, then to have bound them up in barrels, yet much part of the
common people were therewith right well satisfied.

Edmund Shaw Mayor of London.
When the King approached near the City, Edmund Shaw Goldsmith, then Mayor of
the City, with the Aldermen and Sheriffs in Scarlet, and five hundred
commoners in murrey received his Grace reverendly at Harnesay Park, and so
conveyed him to the City, where he entered the fourth day of May, in the
first and last year of his Reign, and was lodged in the Bishop of Londons
Palace: but the Duke of Gloucester bare him in open sight so reverently, saying
to all men as he rode* Behold your Prince and Sovereign Lord, and made such
semblance of lowliness to his Prince, that from the great obloquy that he was
in so late before, he was suddenly fallen in so great trust, that at the
Council next assembled, he was made the only chief Ruler, and thought most
meet to be Protector of the King and his Realm: so that, were it destiny, or
were it folly, the Lamb was betaken to the Wolf to keep. At which counsel
the Archbishop of York was sore blamed for delivering the Great Seal to the
Queen, and the Seal taken from him, and delivered to Doctor John Russell
Bishop of Lincoln, a wise man and a good, and of much experience, and diverse
Lords and Knights were appointed to diverse rooms: the Lord Chamberlain and
some other kept the rooms that they were in before, but not many.

Now were it so that the Protector (which always you must take for the Duke
of Gloucester) sore thirsted for the atchieving of his pretended enterprise,
and thought every day a year till it were performed, yet durst he no farther
attempt, as long as he had but half his prey in his hand, well witting that
if he deposed the one brother, all the Realm would fall toth'other, if he
remained either in Sanctuary or should happily be shortly conveyed to his
Fathers liberty. Wherefore incontinent at the next meeting of the Lords in
Council, he propounded to them, that it was an heinous thing of the Queen,
and proceeding of great malice toward the Kings Counselors, that she should
keep the Kings Brother in Sanctuary from him whose special pleasure and
comfort were to have his Brother with him, and that to be done by her to no
other intent, but to bring all the Lords in an obloquy and murmr of the
people, as though they were not to be trusted with the Kings Brother, which
Lords were by the whole assent of the Nobles of the Realm, appointed as the
Kings near friends, to the tuition of his Royal Person, the prosperity
whereof (quoth he) stands not alone in keeping from enemies and evil diet,
but partly also in recreation and moderate pleasure, which he cannot take in
his tender youth in the company of old and ancient persons, but in the familiar
conversation of those that be not far under, nor far above his age, and
nevertheless, of estate convenient to accompany his Majesty, wherefore with
whom rather then with his own Brother? and if any man think this
consideration light (I think no man so thinks that loves the King) let him
consider, that sometime without small things greater cannot stand, and verily
it redoundeth greatly to the dishonor of the Kings highness, and of all us
that be about his Grace, to have it come in any man's mouth, not in this Realm
only, but also in other Lands (as evil words walk far) that the Kings
Brother should be feign to keep Sanctuary. For every man will judge, that no
man will so do for naught, and such opinions fastened in men's hearts be hard to
be wrested out, and may grow to more grief then any man here can divine.
Wherefore, me thinks, it were not the worst to send to the Queen some
honorable and trusty personage, such as tendreth the Kings weal and the honor
of his Counce, and is also in credit and favor with her; for which
considerations none seems more meetly to me the^ the reverend Father, my Lord
Cardinal, Archbishop of Canterbury, who may in this matter do most good of
all men, if it please him to take the pain, which I doubt not of his goodness
he will not refuse, for the Kings sake and ours, and wealth of the young Duke
himself, the Kings most honorable Brother, and for the comfort of my
Sovereign Lord himself, my most dearest Nephew; considering, that thereby
shall be ceased the slanderous rumor and obloquy now going abroad, and the
hurts avoided that thereof might ensue, and then must rest and quietness grow
to all the Realm. And if she perhaps be so obstinate, and so precisely set in
her own will and opinion, that neither his wise and faithful advertisement can
move her, nor any man's reason satisfy her, then shall we by my advice, by the
Kings authority fetch him out of that prison, and bring him to his Noble
presence, in whose continual company he shall be so well cherished, and so
honorably entreated, that all the world shall to our honor and her reproach,
perceive that it was only malice, frowardness and folly, that caused her to
keep him there. This is my mind for this time, except that any of you, my
Lords, perceive to the contrary, for never shall I by Gods Grace sowed my self
unto mine own will, but I shall be ready to change it upon your better
advices.

When the Protector had said, all the Council affirmed that the motion was
good and reasonable, and to the King and the Duke honorable, and a thing that
should cease great murmr in the Realm, if the Mother might by good means be
induced to deliver him; which thing the Archbishop of Canterbury, whom they all
agreed also to be most convenient thereunto, took upon him to move her, and
thereto to do his uttermost endeavor. Howbeit if she could in no wise be
entreated with her good will to deliver him, then thought he and such of the
spirituality as were present, that it were not in any wise to be attempted, to
take him out against her will, for it would be a thing that should turn to the
grudge of all men, and high displeasure of God, if the privilege of that place
should be broken, which had so many years been kept, which both Kings and
Popes had granted and confirmed, which ground was sanctified by Saint Peter
himself more then five hundred years ago. And since that time, was never so
undevout a King, that ever enterprised that sacred privilege to violate, nor
so holy a Bishop that durst presume the Church of the same to consecrate: and
therefore, quoth the Archbishop, God forbid that any man should, for any
earthly enterprise, break the immunity and liberty of that sacred Sanctuary,
that has been the safeguard of so many a good man's life: but I trust, quoth
he, we shall not need it, but for any manner of need I would we should not do
it, I trust that ^hee with reason shall be contented, and all things in good
manner obtained. And if it hap that I bring it not to pass, yet shall I
further it to my best power, so that you all shall perceive my good will,
diligence, and endeavor: But the Mothers dread and womanish fear shall be
the let if any be.

Nay, womanish frowardness, quoth the Duke of Buckingham, for I dare take it
on my soul, that she well knows that she needs no such thing to fear,
either for her son or for her self. For as for her, here is no man that will
be at war with women, would God some men of her kin were women too, and then
should all be soon at rest. Howbeit, there is none of her kin the less loved
for that they be of her kin, but for their own evil deserving.

And put the case, that we neither loved her nor her kin, yet there were no
cause why we should hate the Kings Noble Brother, to whose Grace we our
selves be kin, whose Honor if she desired as our dishonor, and as much
regard took to his wealth as to her own will, she could be as loath to suffer
him to be absent from the King as any of us, if she had any wit, as would God
she had as good will as she has froward wit. For she thinks her self no
wiser then some that are here, of whose faithful minds she nothing doubts,
but verily believes and acknowledges, that they would be as sorry of his harm
as her own self, and yet they would have him from her if she abide there.

And we all, I think, be content that both her children be with her, if she
came from thence, and abide in such a place where they may be with their
honor. Now if she refuse in the, deliverance of him, to follow the wisdom
of them, whose wisdom she knows, whose approbate fidelity she well
trusts; it is easy to perceive frowardness lets her, and not fear. But
go to, suppose that she fears (as who may let her to fear her own shadow)
the more we ought to fear to leave him in her hands, for if she cast such
fond doubts that she fear his hurt, then will she fear that he shall be
fetched thence, for she will soon think, that if men were set (which God
forbid on so great a mischief) the Sanctuary will little let them, which
Sanctuary good men, as me thinks, might without sin somewhat less regard
then they do.

Now then, if she doubt lest he might be fetched from her, is it not likely
that she will send him somewhere out of the Realm? Verily I look for none
other. And I doubt not but she now as sore minds it, as we mind the let
thereof: And if she might hap to bring that purpose to pass, as it were no
great mastery to do, we letting her alone, all the world would say, that we
were a sort of wise Counselors about a King, to let his Brother be cast away
under our noses. And therefore I ensure you faithfully, for my mind, I will
rather, ma^ger her stomach; fetch him away, then leave him there till her fear
or fond frowardness convey him away, and yet will I break no Sanctuary, for
verily since the privilege of that place, Of Sanctuaries.
and other of that sort, have so long continued, I would not go about to
break it, but if they were now to begin, I would not be he should make them;
yet will not I say nay, but it is a deed of pity, that such men as the chance
of the Sea, or their evil debtors have brought into poverty, should have some
place of refuge to keep in their bodies out of the danger of their cruel
creditors. And if it fortune the Crown to come in question, as it has done
before this time, while each part takes other for Traitors, I think it
necessary to have a place of refuge for both: But as for thieves and murderers,
whereof these places be full, and which never fall from their craft after they
once fall thereunto, it is pity that every Sanctuary should serve them, and
especially wilful murderers, whom God commands to be taken from the Altar,
and to be put to death. And where it is otherwise then in these cases, there
is no need of Sanctuaries, appointed by God in the Old Law. For if necessity of
his own defense, or misfortune drived him to that deed, then a pardon serves
him, which either is granted of course, or the King of pity and compassion
gives.

Now look how few Sanctuary men there be, whom necessity or misfortune
compelled to go thither: And then see on the other ^ide, what a sort there be
commonly therein of such, whom wilful unthriftinesse has brought to naught;
What a rabble of Thieves, Murderers and malicious heinous Traitors be, and
that in two places especially, the one at the elbow of the City, and the other
in the very bowels, I dare well avow it, if you weigh the good that they do,
with the hurt that comes of them, ye shall find it much better to lose both
then to have both. And this, I say, although they were not abused, (as they now
be and so long have been) that I fear me ever they will be while men be
afraid to set their hands to the amendment, as though God and Saint Peter were
the Patrons of ungracious living. Now unthrifts riot and run in debt upon
boldness of these places; yea, and rich men run thither with poor men's goods,
there they build, there they spend and bid their creditors go whistle. Men's
Wives run thither with their Husbands Plate, and say they dare not abide with
their Husbands for beating; Thieves bring thither stolen goods, and live
thereon. There devise they new robberies nightly, and steal out and rob, rive,
and kill men, and come again into those places, as though those places gave
them not only a safeguard for the harm that they have done, but a license also
to do more mischief: howbeit, much of this great abusion, (if wise men would
set their hands there unto) might be amended, with great thanks of God and no
breach of the privilege. The conclusion is, since it is so long ago* I wot
not what Pope and what Prince, more pitious then politic, has granted it,
and other men sensible of a religious fear, have not broken it* let us take
pains with it, and let it stand a Gods Name in his force, as far forth as
reason will, which is not so far forth as may serve to let us of the fetching
forth of this Noble man, to his honor and wealth, out of that place, in the
which he neither is nor can be a Sanctuary or privileged man. A Sanctuary
ever serves to defend the body of that man that stands in danger abroad, not
of great hurt only, but of lawful hurt; for against unlawful hurts and
harms, no Pope nor King intended to privilege any one place, wherein it is
lawful for one man to do another man wrong. That no man unlawfully take hurt,
that liberty, the King, the Law, and very nature forbids in every place, and
makes in that regard, for every man, every place a Sanctuary; but whereas man
is by lawful means in peril, there needs he the tuition of some special
privilege, which is the only ground of all Sanctuaries, from which necessity
this Noble Prince is far, whose love to his King, Nature and kindred proves,
whose innocence to all the world, his tender youth affirms, and so Sanctuary
as for him is not necessary, and none he can have. Men come not to Sanctuary,
as they come to Baptism, to require it by Godfathers, he must ask it himself
that must have it, and reason, since no man has cause to have it, but whose
conscience of his own fault makes him have need to require it. What will then
has yonder Babe, which if he had discretion to require it, if need were, I
dare say would be now right angry with them that keep him there? And I would
think without any scruple of conscience, without any breach of privilege, to
be somewhat more homely with them that be their Sanctuary men indeed, that if
one go to Sanctuary with another man's goods, why should not the King, leaving
his body at liberty, satisfy the party of his goods even within the Sanctuary;
for neither King nor Pope can give any place such a privilege, that it shall
discharge a man of his debts, being able to pay.

And with that, diverse of the Clergy that were there present, whether they said
it for his pleasure, or as they thought, agreed plainly by the Law of God and
of the Church, that a Sanctuary man should be delivered in payment of his
debts, and stolen goods to the owner, and only liberty reserved to him, to get
his living by the labor of his hands. Verily, quoth the Duke, I think ye say
very truth: And what if a man's wife take Sanctuary, because she list to run
from her husband? I would think, if she can allege no other cause, he may
lawfully, without any displeasure done to Saint Peter, take her out of Saint
Peter's Church by the arm. And if no body may be taken out of Sanctuary,
because he says he will abide there, then if a child will take Sanctuary,
because he fears to go to School, his Master must let him alone. And as
simple as that example is, yet is there less reason in our case then in it;
for there, though it be a childish fear, yet is there at the least some fear,
and herein is no fear at all. And verily I have heard of Sanctuary men, but I
never heard before of Sanctuary children; and therefore, as for the conclusion
of my mind, whosoever may deserve to have need of it, if they think it for
their surety, let them keep it, but he can be no Sanctuary man, that has no
other discretion to desire it, nor malice to deserve it, whose life nor liberty
can by any lawful process stand in danger: and he that takes one out of
Sanctuary to do him good, I say plainly he breaks no Sanctuary.

When the Duke hand done, the temporal men wholly, and the most part of the
spiritual men also, thinking no hurt earthly meant toward the young Babe,
condescend in effect, that if he were not delivered he should be fetched out.
Howbeit, they thought it best in avoiding of all manner of rumor, that the
Cardinal should first assay, to get him with her good will. And thereupon all
the Council came to the Star Chamber at Westminster, and the Cardinal leaving
the Protector and other Lords in the Star Chamber, departed into the
Sanctuary to the Queen, accompanied with certain Lords, were it for the
respect of his honor, or that she should by the persons of so many, perceive
that his errand was not only one man's mind, or were it for that the Protector
intended not in this matter to trust one man alone, or else if she finally were
determined to keep him, some of the company had peradventure some secret
instruction incontinent, mauger her will, to take him, and to leave her no
respit to conveigh him.

When the Queen and these Lords were come together in presence, the Cardinal
showed unto her, that it was thought to the Lord Protector and the whole
Council, that her keeping of the Kings Brother in that place highly sounded,
not only to the grudge of the people, and their obloquy, but also to the
importable grief and displeasure of the Kings Royal Majesty, to whose Grace
it were a singular comfort to have his natural Brother in company, and it was
to both their dishonours, and hers also, to suffer him in Sanctuary, as though
the one Brother stood in danger and peril of the other. And he showed her
farther, that the whole Council had sent him to require of her the delivery of
him, that he might be brought to the Kings presence at his liberty out of
that place, which men reckoned as a prison, and there should he be demeaned
according to his estate and degree, and she in this doing, should both do great
good to the Realm, pleasure to the Council, profit to her self, succor to
her friends that were in distress, and over that, which he knew well she
specially tendered, not only great comfort and honor to the King, but also to
the young Duke himself, both whose great weal it were to be together, as well
for many greater causes, as also for both their disport and recreation, which
things the Lords esteemed not light, though it seemed light, well pondering
that their youth without recreation and play cannot endure, nor any stranger
for the convenience of both their ages and estates so meet in that point for
any of them, as the either of them for the other.

My Lord (quoth the Queen) I say not nay, but that it were very convenient that
this Gentleman whom you require were in the company of the King his Brother,
and in good faith, me thinks it were as great commodity to them both, as for
yet a while to be in the custody of their Mother, the tender age considered of
the elder of them both, but especially the younger, which besides his infancy,
that also needs good looking to, has a while been so sore diseased with
sickness, and is so newly, rather little amended then well recovered, that I
dare put no person earthly in trust with his keeping, but my self only,
considering there is, as Physicians say, and as we also find, double the
peril in the resiluation that was in the first sickness, with which disease
Nature being sore labored, forewearied and weakened, waxes the less able to
bear out a new surfeit. And albeit there might be found other that would
happily do their best unto him, yet is there none that either knows better how
to order him then I, that so long have kept him, or is more tenderly like to
cherish him, then his own Mother that bare him. No man denies, good Madame,
quoth the Cardinal, that your Grace of all folk were most necessary about
your children, and so would all the Council, not only be content, but also
glad that it were, if it might stand with your pleasure, to be in such place as
might stand with their honor. But if you appoint your self to tarry here,
then think they it more convenient, the Duke of York were with the King
honorably at his liberty to the comfort of them both, then here as a Sanctuary
man to both their dishonors and obloquy, since there is not always so great
necessity to have the child with the Mother, but that occasion sometime may be
such, that it should be more expedient to keep him elsewhere, which in this
well appears, that at such time that your most dearest son then Prince and
now King, should for his honor and good order of the Country keep household in
Wales far out of your keeping, your Grace was well content therewith your
self. Not very well content (quoth the Queen) and yet the case is not like,
for the one was then in health, the other is now sick, in which case I marvel
greatly why my Lord Protector is so desirous to have him in keeping, where if
the child in his sickness miscarried by nature, yet might he run into
slander and suspicion of fraud. And they call it a thing so sore against my
childs honor and theirs also, that he abides in this place, it is all their
honors, there to suffer his abode, where no man doubts h^ shall be best
kept, and that is here while I am here, which as yet intend not to come forth
and danger my self after other my friends, which would God were rather here in
surety with me, then I were there in danger with them.

Why Madame (quoth the Lord Howard) know you any thing, why they should be in
danger? Nay verily (quoth she) nor why they should be in prison neither, as
they now be, but I trow it is no great marvel, though I fear lest those that
have not let to put them in durance without color, will let as little to
procure their destruction without cause. The Cardinal made a countenance to
the Lord Howard, that he should harp no more upon that string; and then said
he to the Queen, that he nothing doubted, but those Lords of her kin, the
which remained under arrest, should upon the matter examined do well enough,
and as toward her Noble person, neither was, nor could be any manner of danger.

Whereby should I trust that (quoth the Queen) in that I am guiltless, as
though they were guilty, in that I am with their enemies better beloved then
they, when they hate them for my sake, in that I am so near to the King, and
how far be they off that would help, as God send Grace they hurt not. And
therefore as yet I purpose not to depart hence: As for this Gentleman, my son,
I mind he shall be where I am till I see further, for I see some men so
greedy without any substantial cause to have him, which makes me much more
wary and scrupulous to deliver him.

Truly Madame (quoth the Cardinal) the further that ye be to deliver him,
the further be other men to suffer you to keep him, lest your causeless fear
might cause you farther to conveigh him, and many think he can here have no
privilege, which can have neither will to ask it, nor yet malice or offense
to need it. And therefore, they reckon no privilege broken, although they
fetch him out of Sanctuary, which if you finally refuse to deliver him, I
think verily the Council will enfranchise him, so much dread has my Lord his
Uncle, for the tender love he bears him, lest your Grace should send him away.

Ah, quoth the Queen, has he so tender a zeal to him, that he fears
nothing, but lest he should escape him? Thinks he, that I would send him
hence, which is neither in the plight to send out? and in what place could I
reckon him sure, if he be not sure in this Sanctuary? whereof was there never
Tyrant yet so devilish, that durst attempt to break the privilege, and I
trust God is now as strong to withstand his adversaries as ever he was. But my
son can deserve no Sanctuary, you say, and therefore he can not have it,
forsooth the Lord Protector has sent a goodly gloss, by the which that place
that may desend a thief, may not save an innocent: but he is in no danger, nor
has no need thereof, I would God he had not. Troweth the Protector, (I pray
God he may prove a Protector, rather then a destroyer, whereunto his painted
process draws) that it is not honorable that the Duke bide here? it were
more comfortable to them both, that he were with his Brother, because the King
lacks a play-fellow, yea be sure, I pray God send him better play-fellowes
then him that makes so high a matter upon such a trifling pretext, as though
there could none be found to play with the King, but that his Brother, which
has no lust to play for sickness, must come out of Sanctuary, out of his
safeguard, to play with him; as though that Princes so young as they be, could
not play without their Peers, or children could not play without their
kindred, with whom for the most part they agree much worse then with strangers.
But the child, you say, cannot require the privilege, who told the Protector
so? Ask him, and you shall hear him ask it, and so shall he, if ye will.
Howbeit, this is a strange matter; suppose he could not ask it, and think he
would not ask it, and imagine he would ask to go out, if I say he shall not:
Note, if I ask the privilege for my self, I say, that he that against my
will takes out him, breaks Sanctuary. Serves this liberty for my person
only, or for my goods too? you may not from hence take my Horse from me, if I
stale him not nor owe you nothing: then follows it, that you may not take my
child from me, he is also my ward, for as far as my learned Council
shows me, he has nothing by descent holden by Knights service, but by
socage: then the Law makes me his guardian, then may no man lawfully (I
suppose) take my ward from me out of this place, without the breach of
Sanctuary, and if my privilege could not serve him, nor he ask it for
himself, yet since the Law commits to me the custody of him, I may require
it for him, expect the Law give the Infant a guardian only for his goods,
discharging him of the care and safe-keeping of his body, for which only both
goods and lands serve: Wherefore here intend I to keep him, since man's Law
serves the guardian to keep the infant, and the Law of Nature wills the
Mother to keep the child, and Gods Law priviledgeth the Sanctuary, and the
Sanctuary priviledgeth my Son, since I fear to put him to the Protectors
hands, that has his Brother already, which is (if both failed) inheritor to
the Crown as heir Male, as he says. The cause of my fear no man has to
do to examine, and yet fear I no further then the Law fears, which as
learned men tell me, forbids every man the custody of them, by whose death
he may inherit less Land then a Kingdom.

I can say no more, but whosoever he be that breaks this holy Sanctuary, I
pray God send him shortly need of Sanctuary, when he may not come to it, for I
would not that my mortal enemy should be taken out of Sanctuary.

The Cardinal perceived that the Queen ever the longer the farther off, and
also that she began to kindle and chafe, and speak sore biting words against
the Protector, and such as he neither believed, and also was loath to he^re, he
said to her, for a final conclusion, that he would no more dispute the
matter, and if she were content to deliver the Duke to him and to the other
Lords there present, he durst lay his own body and soul both in pledge, not
only for his surety, but also for his estate, and surely he knew nor suspected
any cause but he might so do (but he knew not all.) And further he said, if
she would give him a resolute answer to the contrary, he would therewith
depart incontinent, and shift who so would with his business afterward, for he
never intended further to move her in the matter, in the which she thought
that he and all other also, save her self, lacked either wit or dull truth;
Wit, if they were so that they nothing could perceive what the Protector
intended, and if they should procure her son to be delivered into his hands,
in whom they should perceive toward the child any evil will intended, then
she might think all the Council both evil advised, and of little fidelity
to their Prince.

The Queen with these words stood in a great study, and forasmuch as she saw
the Lord Cardinal more ready to depart then the remnant, and the Protector
himself ready at hand, so that she verily thought that she could not keep
him there, but he should be incontinent taken thence, and to conveigh him
elsewhere, neither had she time to serve her, nor place determined, nor
persons appointed to conveigh him, and so all things were unready, when this
message came so suddenly on her, nothing less looking for, then to have him
out of Sanctuary, which she knew now men to be set in all places about, that
he could not be conveyed out untaken, and party as she thought it might
fortune her fear to be false: so well she knew it was either needless or
bootlesse. Wherefore, if she should needs go from him, she deemed best to
deliver him, and especially of the Cardinals faith she nothing doubting, nor
of some other Lords whom she saw there, which as she feared lest they might be
deceived, so well was she assured, that they would not be corrupted: then
thought she that it would make them the more warily to look to him, and the
more circumspectly to see his surety, if she with her own hands betook him
them by trust, and at the last she took the young Duke by the hand, and said
unto the Lords, my Lord (quoth she) and all my Lords* neither am I so unwise
to mistrust your wits, nor so suspicious to mistrust your truths: of the which
thing I purpose to make such a proof, that if either of both lacked in you,
might turn both me to great sorrow, the Realm to much harm, and you to great
reproach. For lo, here is, quoth she, this Gentleman, whom I doubt not, but I
could keep safe if I would, whatsoever any man say, and I doubt not also, but
there be some abroad so deadly enemies unto my Blood, that if they knew where
any of it lay in their own body, they would let it out: we have also
experience, that the desire of a Kingdom knows no kindred, the Brother has
been the Brothers bane, and may the Nephews be sure of the Uncle? each of
these children are others defense, while they be asunder, and each of their
lives lies in others body, keep one safe and both be sure, and nothing to
both more perilous then both to be in one place: for a wise Merchant never
adventureth all his goods in one Ship. All this notwithstanding, here I deliver
him and his Brother in him, to keep to your hands, of whom I shall ask them
both before God and the world. Faithful you be, and that I know well, and I
know you be wise, and of power and strength if you list to keep him, for you
lack no help of your selves, nor need to lack no help in this case, and if
you cannot elsewhere, then may you leave him here: But only one thing I
beseech you, for the trust that his Father put you in ever, and for the trust I
put you in now, that as far as you think that I fear too much, ye be well
ware that you fear not too little. And therewithal she said to the Child,
Farewell mine own sweet Son, God send you good keeping, let me once kiss
you ere you go, for God knows when we shall kiss together again, and
therewith she kissed him, and blessed him, and turned her back and wept, going
her way, leaving the poor innocent child weeping as fast as the Mother.

When the Cardinal and the other Lords had received the young Duke, they
brought him into the Star Chamber, where the Protector took him into his
arms, and kissed him with these words; now welcome my Lord with all my very
heart, and he said in that of likelihood even as he inwardly thought, and
thereupon forthwith brought him to the King his Brother into the Bishops Palace
at Paul's, and from thence through the City honorably into the Tower, out of
which after that day they never came abroad. When the Protector had both the
children in his possession, yea and that they were in a sure place, he then
began to thirst to see the end of his enterprise. And to avoid all suspicion,
he caused all the Lords which he knew to be faithful to the King, to
assemble at Baynards Castle, to commune of the order of the Coronation, while
he and other of his accomplices and of his affinity, at Crosbies Place, contrived
the contrary, and to make the Protector King; to which Council there were
adhibited very few, and they very secret.

Then began here and there some muttering amongst the people, as though all
things should not long be well, though they knew not what they feared, nor
wherefore: were it, that before such great things, men's hearts (of a secret
instinct of Nature) misgive them, as the South wind sometime swells of it
self before a Tempest: or were it that some one man happily somewhat perceiving,
filled many men with suspicion, though he showed few men what he knew:
howbeit, the dealing it self made men to muse on the matter, though the
Council were close, for by little and litt^e all folk drew from the Tower
where the King was, and drew to Crosbies Place, so that the Protector had all
the resort, and the King was in manner desolate. While some made suit unto them
that had the doing, some of them were by their friends secretly warned, that it
might happily turn to no good to them, to be too much attendant on the King
without the Protectors appointment, which removed diverse of the kings old
servants from him, and set new in their places about him.

Thus many things coming together, partly by chance, and partly by purpose,
caused at length, not common people only, which waver with the wind, but wise
men also and some Lords to mark the matter and muse thereupon: insomuch that
the Lord Stanley, which afterward was Earl of Derby, wisely mistrusted it, and
said to the Lord Hastings, that he much misliked these two several Councels:
for while we, quoth he, talk of one matter at the one place, little know we
whereof they talk in the other: peace* my Lord, quoth the Lord Hastings; on my
life, never doubt you, for while one man is there, which is never thence,
neither can there be any thing once minded that should sound amiss toward
me, but it should be in my ears as soon as out of their mouths. This he
meant by Catesby which was near of his seeret counsel, and whom he most
familiarly used in his weighty matters, putting no man in so special trust as
he, reckoning himself to be beloved of no man more then he; knowing well
that there was no man so much beholding to him as was this Catesby, which was a
man well learned in the laws of this Realm, and by the special favor of the
Lord Hastings in good authority, and bore much rule in the countries of
Leicester and Northampton, where the Lord Hastings power lay. But surely great
pity was it that he had not more thruth or less wit, for his dissimulation
only, kept all that mischief up* in whom if the Lord Hastings had not put so
special trust, the L. Stanley and he, with diverse other Lords, had departed
into their countries and broken all the dance, for many evil signs that he
saw, which he now constructed all for the best; so ^urely thought he that
there could be no harm intended towa^ds him in that council where Catesby
was. And of truth the Protector and the Duke of Buckingham did seem to show
very much countenance unto the Lord Hastings, and kept him often in their
company. And undoubtedly the Protector loved him well, and loath he was to have
lost him, saving for fear lest his life should have quailed their purpose; for
the which cause he moved Catesby to prove with some words cast out afar off,
whether he could think it possible to win the Lord Hastings to their part.
But Catesby, whether he assayed him or assayed him not, reported unto him that
he found him so fast, and heard him speak so terrible words, that he durst no
further break unto him: and of a truth the Lord Hastings of very trust showed
unto Catesby the mistrust that others began to have in the matter. And
therefore he fearing least their motions might with the Lord Hastings diminish
his credit, whereunto only all the matter leaned; procured the Protector
hastily to rid him, and much the rather, for he trusted by his death to obtain
much of the rule which the Lord Hastings bare in his country; the only desire
whereof, was the the thing that induced him to be procurer, and one of the
specialest contrivers of all this horrible treason. Whereupon the Lord
Protector caused a Council to be set at the Tower on the friday the
thirteenth day June, where was much communing for the honorable solemnity of
the Coronation, of the which the time appointed approached so near, that the
Pageants were a making day and night at Westminster, and vitailes killed, which
afterward was cast away.

These Lords thus sitting communing of this matter, the Protector came in among
them about nine of the clock, saluting them courteously, excusing himself that
he had been from them so long, saying merrily that he had been a sleep that
day. And after a little talking with them, he said to the Bishop of Ely, my
Lord, you have very good strawberies in your garden at Holbourne, I require you
let us have a mess of them. Gladly (my Lord, quoth he) I would I had some
better thing as ready at your pleasure as that, and with that in all have he
sent his servant for a dish of Strawberies. The Protector set the Lords fast
on communing, and thereupon prayed them to spare him a little, and so he
departed and came again between ten and eleven of the clock into the
chamber, all changed with a sour angry countenance, knitting the brows,
frowning and fretting, gnawing of his lips and so set him down in his place.
All the Lords were dismayed, and sore marvelled at this manner and sudden
change, what he should ayle. When he had sitten a while, thus he began: What
were they worthy to have, that compass and imagine the destruction of me
being so near of blood to the King and Protector of this his Royal Realm? At
which question, all the Lords sat sore astonished, musing much by whom the
question should be meant, of which every man knew himself clear.

Then the Lord Hastings, who for the familiarity that was between them,
thought he might be boldest with him, answered and said, that they were worth^e
to be punished as heinous traitors whatsoever they were, and all the other
affirmed the same: that is (quoth he) yonder Sorceresse, my brothers wife, and
others with her, meaning the Queen: at these words many of the Lords were sore
abashed which favored her, but the Lord Hastings was better content in his
mind, that it was moved by her, then by any other that he loved better,
albeit his heart grudged that he was not before made of the counsel of this
matter, as well as he was of the taking of her kindred, and of their putting
to death, which were by his assent before devised to be beheaded at Pomfrete,
this self same day, in the which he was not aware that it was by others
devised, that he himself should the same day be beheaded at London: then said
the Protector, See in what wise that Sorceresse, and others of her council,
as Shores wife with her affinity, have by their sorcery and witchcraft thus
wasted my body: and therewith plucked up his doublet sleeve to his elbow on his
left arm, where he showed a werish withered arm, and small, as it was never
other. And therefore every man's mind misgave them, well perceiving that this
matter was but a quarrel; for they knew that the Queen was both too wise to
go about any such folly, and also if she would, yet she would not make Shores
wife of her counsel, whom of al women she most hated, as that concubine whom
the King her husband most loved.

Also, there was no man there but knew that his arm was ever such since the
day of his birth: Nevertheless the Lord Hastings, which from the death of King
Edward kept Shores wife, on whom he somewhat doted in the Kings life, saving it
is said that he forbear her for reverence toward his King, or else of a
certain kind of fidelity toward his friend; Yet now his heart somewhat
grudged to have her whom he loved so highly accused, and as he knew well,
untruly; therefore he answered and said, certainly my Lord, if they have so
done, they be worthy of heinous punishment. What, quoth the Protector, thou
servest me, I think with if and with and, I tell thee they have done it, and
that I will make it good on thy body, traitor. And therewith (as in a great
anger) he struck his fist on the board a great rappe; at which token given,
one cried treason without the chamber, and therewith a door clapped, and men in
arms came rushing in, as many as the chamber could hold. And anon the
Protector said to the Lord Hastings, I arest thee Traitor: what me my Lord
quoth he? yes thou Traitor, quoth the Protector. And one let fly at the Lord
Stanley, who shrunk at the stroke, and fell under the Table, or else his head
had been cleft to the teeth, for as suddenly as he shrunk; yet the blood ran
about his ears. Then was the Archbishop of York, and Doctor Morton Bishop of
Ely, and the Lord Stanley and diverse others taken, and bestowed in several
chambers, save the Lord Hastings (whom the Protector commanded to speed and
shrive him apace) for by Saint Paul (quoth he) I will not dine till I see thy
head off. It booted him not to ask why, but heavily he took a Priest at
aventure, and made a short shrift, for a longer would not be suffered, the
Protector made so much have to his dinner, who might not go to it till this
murder were done, for saving of his ungratious oath. So was he brought forth
into the green besides the Chapel within the Tower, and his head laid down
on a logge of timber that lay there for building of the Chapel, and there
tyrannously stricken off; and after his body and head were enterred at Windsor
by his Master King Edward the fourth, Late deceased.

A miraculous case it is to hear, either the warnings that he should have
avoided, or the tokens of that he could not avoid. For the next night before
his death, the Lord Stanley sent to him a trusty messenger at midnight in all
the haste, requiring him to rise and ride away with him, for he was disposed
utterly no longer for to abide, for he had a fearful dream in the which he
thought that a Bore with his tuskes so rased them both by the heads, that the
blood ran about both their shoulders; and for as much as the Protector gave the
Bore for his cognizance, he imagined that it should be he. This dream made
such a fearful impression in his heart, that he was thoroughly determined no
longer to tarry, but had his horse ready, if the Lord Hastings would go with
him. So that they would ride so far that night, that they should be out of
danger by the next day. A good Lord (quoth the Lord Hastings) to the messenger,
leans my Lord thy Master so much to such trifles, and has he such faith in
dreams, which either his own fear fantasieth, or do rise in the nights rest
by reason of the days thought? Tell him it is plain witchcraft to believe in
such dreams, which if they were tokens of things to come, why thinks he not
that we might as likely make them true by our going if we were caught and
brought back, (as friends flyers) for then had the bore a cause likely to raze
us with his tuskes, as folks that fled for some falsehood: wherefore either
there is peril, but indeed there is none, or if any be, it is rather in going
then abiding. And if we must needs fall into peril one way or other, yet had
I rather that men should see it were by other men's falsehood, then think it
were either our own fault or faint feeble heart, and therefore go to thy
Master and commend me to him, and tell him I pray him to be merry and have no
fear, for I assure him, I am assured of the man he wotteth of, as I am sure of
mine own hand. God send grace (quoth the messenger) and so departed. Certain
it is also, that in riding toward the Tower the same morning in which he was
beheaded, his horse that he accustomed to ride on, stumbled twice or thrice
almost to the falling, which thing although it happens to them daily to whom
no mischance is toward, yet has it been as an old evil token observed as a
going toward mischief. Now this that follows was no warning, but an envious
scorn: the same morning before he was up from his bed, where Shores wife lay
with him all night, there came to him sir Thomas Haward son to the Lord Haward
(which Lord was once of the priviest of the Lord Protectours counsel and
doing) as it were of courtesy to accompany him to the council, but of truth
sent by the Lord Protector to have him thitherward.

This sir Thomas, while the Lord Hastings stayed a while commoning with a
Priest who^ he met in Towerstreete, brake the Lords tale, saying to him
merrily, what my Lord I pray you come on, wherefore talk you so long with that
Priest, you have no need of a Priest yet, and laughed upon him, as though he
would say, you shall have need of one soon: But little thought the other what
he meant (but before night these words were well remembered by them that heard
them) so the true Lord Hastings little mistrusted, and was never merier, nor
thought his life in more surety in all his days, which thing is often a sign
of change: but I shall rather let any thing pass me then the vain surety of
man's mind so near his death; for upon the very Towerwharfe, so near the
place where his head was off so soon after, as a man might cast a ball, a
Pursievant of his own called Hastings met with him; and of their meeting in
that place he was put in remembrance another time, in which it happened them
to meet before together in the place, at which time the Lord Hastings had been
accused to King Edward by the Lord Rivers the Queens brother, insomuch that he
was for a while, which lasted not long, highly in the Kings indignation, as he
now met the same Pursevant in the same place, the jeoperdie so well passed, it
gave him great pleasure to talk with him thereof, with whom he had talked in
the same place of that matter, and therefore he said; Ah Hastings, art thou
remembered when I met thee here once with a heavy heart? Yea my Lord (quoth he)
that I remember well, and thanks be to God they got no good, nor you harm
thereby; thou would say so (quoth he) if thou knew so much as I do,
which few know yet, and more shall shortly, that meant he that the Earl
Rivers, and the Lord Richard, and Sir Thomas Vaughan, should that day be
beheaded at Pomfret, as they were indeed, which act he knew well should be
done, but thought not that the Axe hung so near his own head.

In faith man (quoth he) I was never so sorry, nor never stood in so great
danger of my life, as I did when thou and I met here, and lo the world is
turned now, now stand mine enemies in the danger, as thou may hap to hear
more hereafter, and I never in my life merrier, nor never in so great surety. I
pray God it prove so (quoth Hastings) prove, quoth he? doubtest thou that) nay,
nay, I warrant thee; and so in manner displeased, he entered into the Tower,
where he was not long alive, as you have heard. O Lord God, the blindness of
our mortal nature, when he most feared, he was in most surety, and when he
reckoned himself most sure, he lost his life, and that within two hours
after. Thus ended this honorable man, a good Knight and gentle, of great
authority with his Prince, of living somewhat dissolute, plain and open to his
enemy, and sure and secret to his friend, easy to beguile, as he that of good
heart and courage fo^^saw no perils, a loving man and passing well beloved,
very faithful, and trusty enough, bu^ trusting too much was his destruction,
as you may perceive.

Now flew the fame of thi^ Lords death through the City and farther about, like
a win^ in every man's ear; but the Protector immediately afte^ dinner
(intending to set some color upon the matter) sent in all the haste for many
substantial men out of the City into the Tower, and at their coming, himself
with the Duke of Buckingham, stood harnessed in old ill-favored Briganders,
such as no man would think that they would have vouchsafed to have put on
their backs, except some sudden necessity had constrained them. Then the Lord
Protector showed them, that the Lord Hastings and other of his conspiracy, had
contrived to have suddenly destroyed him and the Duke of Buckingham there the
same day in Council, and what they intended farther, was yet not well known, of
which their treason he had never knowledge before ten of the clock the same
forenoone, which sudden fear drove them to put on such harness as came next
to their hands for their defense, and so God help them, that the mischief
turned upon them that would have done it, and thus he required them to report.
Every man answered fair, as though no man mistrusted the matter, which of
truth no man believed. Yet for the further appeasing of the peoples minds, he
sent immediately after dinner an Herald of Arms with a Proclamation through
the Cirie of London, which was proclaimed in the Kings Name, that the Lord
Hastings, with diverse other of his traiterous purpose, had before conspired,
the same day, to have slain the Protector and the Duke of Buckingham, fitting
in Council; and after to have taken upon them the rule of the King and the
Realm at their pleasure, and thereby to pill and spoil whom they list
uncontrouled, and much matter was devised in the same Proclamation to the
slander of the Lord Hastings, as that he was an evil Councellor to the Kings
Father, entising him to many things highly redounding to the diminishing of his
honor, and to the universal hurt of his Realm, by his evil company, and
sinister procuring, and ungracious example, as well in many other things, as in
vicious living, and inordinate abusing of his body, both with many other, and
especially with Shores wife, which was one of his secret Council in this
heinous treason, with whom he lay nightly, and namely the night passed next
before his death, so that it was the less marvel, if ungracious living
brought him to an unhappy end, which he was now put to by the command of the
Kings Highness, and of his honorable and faithful Council, both for his
demerits, being so openly taken in his false contrived treason, and also lest
the delaying of his execution might have encouraged other mischievous persons
partners of his conspiracy, to gather and assemble themselves together in
making so great commotion for his deliverance, whose hope now, being by his
well deserved death politickly repressed, all the Realm shall by Gods grace
rest in good quiet and peace.

Now was this proclamation made within two hours after he was beheaded, and
it was so curiously indicted, and so fair written in Parchment in a fair set
hand, and therewith so large a process, that every child might perceive that it
was prepared and studied before, and (as some men thought) by Catesby, for all
the time between his death and the publishing of the Proclamation could scarce
have sufficed to the bare writing of it alone, albeit that it had been in
paper, and scribled forth in have at adventure. So that upon the proclaiming
thereof, one that was schoolmaster at Paul's standing by, and comparing the
shortenesse of the time with the length of the matter, said to them that stood
about him: here is a gay goodly cast, foully cast away for haste. And a Merchant
that stood by him, said, that it was written by inspiration and prophecy. Now
then by and by, as it were for anger, and not for covetousness the Protector
sent Sir Thomas Howard to the house of Shores wife (for her Husband dwelt not
with her) which spoiled her of all that ever she had, above the value of two or
three thousand Marks, and sent her body to prison. And the Protector had laid
to her for the manner sake, that she was of Council with the Lord Hastings to
destroy him. In conclusion, when no color could fasten upon these matters,
then he laid heinously to her charge that thing that she could not deny, for
all the world knew that it was true, and that notwithstanding every man laughed
to hear it then so suddenly, so highly taken, that she was naught of her body.
And for this cause, as a godly continent Prince, clean and fau^tlesse of
himself, sent out of Heaven into this vicious world, for the amendment of men's
manners, he caused the Bishop of London to put her to open penance, going
before a cross one Sunday at procession with a taper in her hand. In the which
she went in countenance and pace so womanly, and albeit she was out of all
array saving her kirtle only, yet went she so fair and lovely, and namely
when the wondering of the people cast a comely red in her cheeks, of the which
before she had most miss, that her great shame won her much praise amongst
them that were more amorous of her body, the^ curious of her soul: and many
good folk that hated her living and were glad to see sin corrected, yet
pitied they more her penance then rejoiced at it; when they considered that
the Protector did it more of a corrupt mind then any virtuous affection. The
description of Shores wife.


This woman was borne in London, well friended, honestly brought up, and very
well married, saving somewhat too soon, her husband an honest and a young
Citizen, godly and of good substance, but forasmuch as they were coupled before
she was well ripe, she not very fervently loved for whom she never longed,
which was the thing (by chance) that the more easily made her to incline to the
Kings appetite, when he required her. Howbeit the respect of his royalty, the
hope of gain, apparel, ease, pleasure, and other wanton wealth was able
soon to pierce a soft tender heart: but when the King had abused her, anon her
husband being an honest man would not presume to touch a Kings concubine, but
left her up to him altogether. When the King died, the Lord Hastings took her,
which in the Kings days, albeit that he was sore enamored with her yet he
forbear, either for a princely re^erence, or for a certain friendly
faithfulness. Proper she was and fair, nothing in her body that you could
have changed, but if you would have wished her somewhat higher. This say they
that knew her in her youth, some said and judged that she had been well
favored, and some judged the contrary, whose judgment seems like as men
guess the beauty of one long before departed, by a shape taken out of a
charnell house, and this judgment was in the time of King Henry the eight, in
the eighteenth year of whose reign she dyed, when she had nothing but a
rivelled skin and bone. Her beauty pleased not men so much as her pleasant
behavior, for she had a proper wit, and could both read and write, merry in
company, ready and quick of answer, neither mute nor full of babble, sometimes
taunting without displeasure, but not without disport. King Edward would say he
had three concubines, which in diverse properties diversely excelled, one the
merriest the other the wi^est the third the holiest harlot in the Realm, as
one, whom no man could get out of the Church to any place lightly, The
description of King Edwards three Concubines.
unless it were to his bed, the other two were somewhat greater personages
then Mistress Shore, and yet nevertheless of their humility were content to
be namelesse, and to forbear the praise of these properties. But the merriest
was Shores wife, in whom the King therefore took great pleasure, for many he
had, but her he loved, whose favor to say the truth (for it were sin to
belie the devil) she never abused to any man's hurt, but to many men's comfort
and relief. For where the King took displeasure, she would mitigate and
appease his mind, where men were out of favor, she would bring them into his
grace, for many that had highly offended, she obtained pardon, and of great
forfeitures she gate remission, and finally in many weighty suites she stood
many men in great stead, either for none or for very small reward: and those
rather gay then rich, either that she was content with the deed well done, or
for that she delighted to be sued unto, and to show what she was able to do
with the King, or for that that wanton women and wealthy be not always
covetous. I doubt not some men will think this woman to be too slight to be
written of among grave and weighty matters, which they shall specially think
that happily saw her in her age and adversity, but we think the chance so much
more worthy to be remembered, in how much after wealth she fell to poverty, and
from riches to beggary, unfriended, out of acquaintance, after great substance,
after so great favor with her Prince, after as great suite and seeking to with
all those which in those days had business to speed, as many other men were
in their times, which be now famous only by the infamy of their evil deeds,
her doings were not much less, albeit they be much less remembered, because
they were not evil, for men use to write an evil turn in marble stone, but a
good turn in the dust; which is not worst proved by her, for after her wealth
she went begging of many that had begged themselves if she had not hope them,
such was her chance.

Now was it devised by the Protector and his Council, that the same day that
the Lord Chamberlain was headed in the Tower of London, and about the same
hour, should be beheaded at Pomfret the Earl Rivers, and the Lord Richard the
Queens son, sir Thomas Vaughan, and sir Richard Haute, which as you heard
were taken at Northampton and Stony stratford by the consent of the Lord
Hastings; which execution was done by the order and in the presence of sir
Richard Ratclif knight, whose service the Protector specially used in the
Council, and in the execution of such lawless enterprises, as a man that had
been long secret with him, having experience of the world, a notable wit,
short and rude in speech, rough and boisterous of behavior, bold in mischief,
and as far from pity as from all fear of God.

This Knight brought these four persons to the Scaffold at the day appointed,
and showed to all the people that they were Traitors, not suffering the Lords
to speak, and to declare their innocence, lest their words might have inclined
men to pity them* and to hate the Protector and his part, and so without
judgment and process of the Law caused them to be beheaded without other
earthly guilt, but only they were good men, and true to the King, and too nie
to the Queen; insomuch that sir Thomas Vaughan going to his death said; A
mischeife take them that took the prophecy that G. should destroy King
Edwards children, for George Duke of Clarence, Lord George, which for that
suspicion is now dead, but now remains Richard G. Duke of Gloucester, which
now I see is he that shall and will accomplish the Prophecy, and destroy King
Edwards children, and all their allies and friends, as it appears by us this
day; whom I appeal to the high tribunal of God for his wrongful murder, and
our true innocence. And then Ratclife said, you have well appealed, lay down
your head, yea quoth sir Thomas, I dye in right, beware you dye not in wrong,
and so that good Knight was beheaded, and the other three, and buried naked in
the Monastery at Pomfret.

When the Lord Hastings and those other Lords and Knights were thus beheaded
and rid out of the way, then the Protector caused it to be proclaimed that the
Coronation for diverse great and urgent causes should be deferred till the
second day of November, for then thought he, that while men mused what the
matter meant, and whiles the Lords of the Realm were about him, out of their
own strengths, and while no man knew what to think, nor whom to trust, or
whether they should have time or space to digest the matter, and make parts; it
were best hastily to pursue his purpose, and put himself in possession of the
Crown, before men could have time to devise any ways to resist. But now was
all the study, how this matter, being of it self so heinous, might be first
broken to the people in such wise as it might be well taken.

To this council they took diverse, such as they thought meet to be trusted,
and likely to be induced to that part, and able to stand them in stead, either
by power or by policy. Among whom, they made of Council Edmond Shaw then
Mayor of London, which upon trust of his own advancement, where he was of a
proud heart, highly desirous, took upon him to frame the City to their
appetite. Of Spiritual men they took such as had wit, and were in authority
amongst the people for opinion of their learning, and had no scrupulus
conscience. Amongst these had, they took Ralph Shaw clearke, brother to the
Mayor, and Friar Pinkie, provincial of the Augustine Friars, both Doctors in
Divinity, both great Preachers, both of more learning then virtue, of more fame
then learning and yet of more learning then truth. For they were before greatly
esteemed among the people, but after that, never none of those two were
regarded. Shaw made a Sermon in praise of the Protector before the Coronation,
and Pynkie made one after the Cornation, both so full of tedious flattery, that
no good man's ears could abide them: Pynkie in his Sermon so lost his vocye,
that he was feign to leave off and come down in the midst: Doctor Shaw by his
Sermon lost his honesty, and soon after his life, for very shame of the world,
into the which he durst never after much come abroad: but the Friar feared no
shame, and so it harmed him the less. Howbeit, some doubt, and many think,
that Pynkie was not of Council before the Coronation, but after the common
manner fell to flattery after; namely, because his Sermon was not incontinent
upon it, but at S. Mary Spitle the Easter after. But certain it is, that
Doctor Shaw was of Council in the beginning, in so much that they determined
that he should first break the matter in a Sermon at Paul's Cross, in which
he should by the authority of his Preaching induce the people to incline to
the Protectors ghostly purpose. But now was all the labor and study in the
device of some convenient pretext, for which the people should be content to
depose the Prince, and accept the Protector for their King. In which deuers,
things they devised, but the chief thing, and the weight of all that invention
rested in this; that they should allege bastardy in King Edward himself, or
in his children, or both; so that he should seem disabled to inherit the
Crown by the Duke of York, and the Prince by him. To lay bastardy in King
Edward sounded openly to the rebuk of the Protectours own mother, which was
mother to them both. For in that point could be no other color, but to pretend
that his own mother was an Adultresse; but nevertheless he would that point
should be less and more finely and closely handled, not even fully plain and
directly, but touched upon craftily, as though men spared in that point to
speak all the truth for fear of his displeasure. But that other point
concerning the bastardy they devised to surmise in King Edward his Children,
that he desired should be openly declared and enforced to the uttermost. The
color and pretext whereof cannot be well perceived, except we repeat some
things long before done about King Edwards Marriages.

After King Edward the fourth had deposed King Henry the sixth, and was in
peaceable possession of the Realm; he determined with himself to marry (as
was requisite) both for himself and for the Realm: he sent the Earl of
Warwick and diverse other noble men in embassage to the French King, to entreat
a marriage between the King and Bona, sister to the French Queen, then being
in France. In which thing the Earl of Warwick found the parties so toward and
willing, that he speedily without any difficulty according to his
instructions brought the matter to a good conclusion. Now happens it in the
mean season, there came to make a suit to the King by Petition; Dame Elizabeth
Gray, (which after was his Queen) then a widow, borne of noble blood,
specially by her mother, which was Duchess of Bedford, and she was married to
sir Richard Woodvile, Lord Rivers, her Father.

Howbeit, this Elizabeth being in service with Queen Margaret wife to King
Henry the sixth, was married to one John Gray Esquier, whom King Henry made
Knight at the last battle of Saint Albons, but little while he enjoyed his
knighthood, for at the same field he was slain.

After when King Edward was King, and the Earl of Warwick being on his
Embassage, this poor Lady made her suit to the King to be restored to such
small lands as her husband had given her in jointure; who^ when the King
beheld, and heard her speak, as she was both fair and of good favor, moderate
of stature, well made, and very wise; he not alone pitched on her, but also
waxed enamored on her, and taking her secretly aside, began to enter into
talking more familiarly, whose appetite when she perceived, she virtuously
denied him, but that she did so wisely, and that with so good manner, and
words so well set, that she rather kindled his desire then quenched it. And
finally, after many a meeting and much wooing, and many great promises, she
well perceived the Kings affection toward her so greatly increased, that she
durst somewhat the more boldly say her mind, as to him whose heart she
perceived more fervently set then to fall off for a word. And in conclusion
she showed him plain, that as she thought her self too simple to be his
wife, so she thought her self too good to be his concubine. The King much
marvelling at her constancy, as he that had not been before elsewhere so
stiffely said nay, so much esteemed her continency and chastity, that he set
her virtue in stead of possession and riches: And thus taking counsel of his
own desire, determined in haste to marry her.

And after that he was thus appointed, and had betw^ene them twain assured
her, then asked he counsel of his secret friends, and that in such manner,
that they might easily perceive that it booted them not to say nay.
Notwithstanding, the Duchess of York his mother was so sore moved therewith,
that she dissuaded that marriage as much as she possible might: alleging that
it was his honor, profit, and surety, to marry in some noble progeny out of
his Realm, whereupon depended great strength to his estate by that affinity,
and great possibility of increase of his dominions. And that he could not well
otherwise do, considering the Earl of Warwick had so farforth entered into
the matter already, which was not like to take it well if all his voyage were
in such wise frustrate, and his appointment deluded. And she said further, that
it was not Princely to marry his own Subject, no greater occasion leading
there unto; no possessions nor other commodity depending thereupon, but only
as a rich man would marry his maiden only for a little wanton dotage upon her
person. In which marriage many men commend more the maidens fortune then the
man's wisdom: and yet she said that there was more honesty, then honor in
this marriage; for as much as there is not between a Merchant and his maid so
great a difference, as between a King and his Subject, a great Prince and a
poor widow. In whose person, although there were nothing to be misliked, yet
was there, said she, nothing so excellent, but that it might be found in
diverse other that were more me (quoth she) for your estate, yea and maidens
also, the only widowhood of Dame Elizabeth Gray (although she were in all
other points and things convenient for you) should suffice, as I th^nke, to
refrain you from her marriage, since it is an unfitting thing, and a great
blemish to the sacred Majesty of a Prince, that ought as near to approach
priesthood in cleanness, as he does in dignity, to be defiled with bigamy in
his first marriage. The King made his Mother an answer, part in earnest, and
part in play merrily, as he that knew himself out of her rule: and albeit he
would gladly that she should take it well, yet was he at a point in his own
mind, took she it well or otherwise. Howbeit, somewhat to satisfy her, he
said, that albeit marriage being a spiritual thing, ought rather to be made
for the respect of God; where his grace inclines, the parties ought to incline
to love together (as he trusted it was in his case) rather then for the regard
of any temporal advantage: yet nevertheless he deemed this marriage well
considered not to be unprofitable, for he reckoned the amity of no earthly
Nation to be so necessary for him, as the friendship of his own, which he
thought likely to bear him so much the more hearty favor, in that he
disdained not to marry with one of his own Land: and yet if outward alliance
were thought so requisite, he would find the means to enter thereunto much
better by other of his kin, where all parties could be contented, then to marry
himself, wherein he should never happily love, and for the possibility of
possessions lose the fruit and pleasure of this that he had already. For small
pleasure takes a man of all that ever he has beside* if he be wived against
his appetite, and I doubt not (quoth he) but there be, as you say, others that
be in every point comparable with her; and therefore I let not them that like
them to marry them, no more is it reason that it mislike any man that I marry
where it likes me. And I am sure, that my Cousin of Warwick, neither loves
me so little, to grudge at that that I love, nor is so unreasonable, to look
that I should in choice of a wife rather be ruled by his eye then by mine own,
as though I were a ward that were bound to marry by the appointment of a
Guardian. I would not be a King with that condition, to forbear mine own
liberty in choice of mine own marriage. As for possibility of more inheritance
by new affinity in strange Lands, is often the occasion of more trouble then
profit. And we have already title by that means, as suffices to so much as
suffices to get and keep well in one man's days. That she is a widow and
has already children: By God his blessed Lady, I am a Bachelor and have some
too, and so each of us has a proof, that neither of us is like to be barren.
And therefore, Madame, I pray you be content, I trust to God she shall bring
forth a young Prince that shall please you. And as for the bigamy, let the
Bishop hardly lay it to my charge when I come to take orders, for I understand
it is forbidden a Priest, but I never knew that it was forbidden a Prince.

The Duchess with these words nothing appeased, and seeing the King so set
on, that she could not pluck him back, so highly she disdained it, that, under
pretense of her duty toward God* she devised to disturb this marriage, and
rather to help, that he should marry one Dame Elizabeth Lucie, whom the King
not long before had gotten with child; wherefore the Kings Mother objected
openly against this marriage (as it were in discharge of her conscience) that
the King was sure to Dame Elizabeth Lucy, and her husband before God, by reason
of which words such obstacle was made in that matter, that either the Bishop
durst not, or the King would not proceed to the solemnization of the marriage,
till his fame were clearly purged, and the truth well and openly testified.
Whereupon Dame Elizabeth Lucy was sent for, and albeit she was by the Kings
Mother and many other put in good comfort that she was ensured to the King, yet
when she was solemnly sworn to say the truth, she confessed she was never
ensured. Howbeit, she said, his Grace spoke such loving words to her, that
she verily hoped, that he would have married her, and if such kind words had
not been, she would never have showed such kindness to him, to let him so
kindly get her with child. This examination solemnly taken, it was clearly
proved, that there was no impediment to let the King to marry; wherefore, he
shortly after at Grafton beside Stony Stratford married the Lady Elizabeth Gray
very privily, which was his enemies wife, and had prayed heartily for his
loss, in the which God loved her better, then to grant her her boon, for then
had she not been his wife: And after that she was crowned Queen, and her
father was created Earl Rivers, and her son created Marquess Dorset. But
when the Earl of Warwick understood of this marriage, he took it so highly,
that thereof ensued much bloodshed, as is declared before in the Story of
Edward the fourth.

I have rehearsed this marriage somewhat the more at length, because it might
thereby the better appear upon how slippery a ground the Protector builded his
color, by which he pretended King Edwards children to be Bastards: but the
invention, as simple as it was, liked them to whom it suffices to have
somewhat to say, while they were sure to be compelled to no larger proof then
themselves list to make.

Now to return where I left, as I began to show you, it was by the Protector
and his Council concluded, that this Doctor Shaw should in a Sermon at Paul's
Cross signify to the people, that neither King Edward himself, nor the Duke
of Clarence were lawfully begotten, nor were the very children of the Duke of
York, but begotten unlawfully by other persons by adultery of the Duchess
their Mother. And Dame Elizabeth Lucy was the very wife of King Edward, and so
Prince Edward and all the children begotten on the Queen were Bastards. And
according to this device, Doctor Shaw the Sunday after, at Paul's Cross, in a
great audience (as always a great number assembled to his preaching) came into
the Pulpit, taking for his Theme, Spuria vitulamina non dabunt radices altos,
Sapien. 4. that is to say, Bastard slippes shall never take deep roots:
Whereupon when he had showed the great grace that God gives, and secretly
infundeth in right generation after the Laws of Matrimony, then declared he,
that those children commonly lacked that grace and (for the punishment of their
parents) were for the most part unhappy, which were ilegitimate, and especially
in adultery, of which though some (by the ignorance of the world, and truth hid
from knowledge) have inherited for a season other men's Lands, yet God always
so provideth, that it continues not in their blood long, but the truth coming
to light, the rightful inheritors be restored and the bastard slippes plucked
up ere it can be rooted deep. And when he had laid for the proof and
confirmation of this sentence, examples taken out of the old and new Testament
and other ancient Histories, then began he to descend to the praise of the Lord
Richard Duke of York, calling him father to the Protector, and declared his
Title to the Crown by inheritance, and also by entai^e authorized by
Parliament after the death of King Henry the sixth. Then showed he, that the
Lord Protector was only the right heir of his body lawfully begotten. Then
declared he, that King Edward was never lawfully married to the Queen, but
his wife before God, was Dame Elizabeth Lucy, and so his children were
Bastards. And besides that, that neither King Edward himself, nor the Duke of
Clarence (amongst them that were secret in the Duke of Yorkes household) were
never reckoned surely to be the children of the Noble Duke, as those that by
their favors more resembled other known men, then him; from whose virtuous
conditions, he said also, that King Edward was far off. But the Lord
Protector (quoth he) that very Noble Prince, the special Patron of Knightly
Prowess, as well in all Princely behavior, as in the lineaments and favor of
his visage, represents the very face of the Noble Duke his Father. This is
(quoth he) the Fathers own figure, this is his own countenance, the very
print of his visage, the sure undoubted image, the plain express likeness of
that Noble Duke.

Now was it before devised, that in the speaking of these words, the Protector
should have come in amongst the people to the Sermon, to the end, that these
words so meeting with his presence, might have been taken amongst the hearers,
as though the Holy Ghost had put them in the Preachers mouth, and should have
moved the people even there to have cried, King Richard, that it might have
been after said, that he was specialy chosen by God, and in manner by miracle:
but this device quailed, either by the Protectors negligence, or the Preachers
overhasty diligence. For while the Protector, found by the way tarrying, lest
he should have prevented these words, the Doctor fearing, that he should come
ere his Sermon could come to those words, hasting his matter thereto, he was
come to them and past them, and entered into other matters ere the Protector
came, whom when he beheld coming, he left the matter in hand, and out of all
order, and out of all frame, began to repeat those words again: This is the
very Noble Prince, the especial Patron of Knightly prowess, which as well in
all Princely behaviviour, as in the lineaments and favor of his visage,
represents the very face of the Noble Duke of York his father. This is his
Fathers own figure, this is his own countenance, the very print of his
visage, the sure undoubted image, the plain express likeness of that Noble
Duke, whose remembrance can never dye while he lives: While these words were
speaking, the Protector accompanied with the Duke of Buckingham, went through
the people up into the place where the Doctors stand, where they heard out the
Sermon: but the people were so far from crying King Richard, that they stood
as they had been turned into stones for wonder of this shameful Sermon: after
which once ended, the Preacher gat him home and never after durst look out for
shame, but kept him out of sight as an owl, and when he asked any of his old
friends, what the people talked of him, although that his own conscience will
show him that they talked no good, yet when the other answered him, that there
was in every man's mouth of him much shame spoken, it so struck him to the
heart, that in few days after he withered away.

Then on the Tuesday after, next following this Sermon, being the seventeenth
day of June, there came to Guild Hall London, the Duke of Buckingham, and
diverse Lords and Knights, more then happily knew the message that they brought.
And at the East end of the Hall where the Hoystings be kept, the Duke and the
Major and the other Lords sat down, and the Aldermen also, all the commons of
the City being assembled and standing before them. After silence commanded
upon a great pain in the Protectours name: The Duke stood up, and as he was
well learned and of nature marvelously well spoken, he said to the people with
a clear and a loud voice: Friends, for the the zeal and hearty favor that we
bare you, we be come to break off a matter right great and weighty, and no
less weighty then pleasing to God, and profitable to the Realm, nor to no
part of the Realm more profitable, then to you the Citizens of this noble
City. For why, the thing that you have long lacked, and as we well know, sore
longed for, that you would have gone far to fetch: that thing we be come
hither to bring you, without your labor, pain, cost, adventure, or danger.
What thing is that? Certainly the surety of your own bodies, the quiet of
your wives and daughters, and the safeguard of your wives and daughters, and the
safeguard of your goods: Of all which things in times past you stood in doubt.
For who was he of you all that could reckon himself Lord of his own goods,
amongst so many gynnes and trappes as were set for them, among so much pilling
and polling, among so many taxes and talliages, of the which there was never
end, and often times no need, or if any were, it grew rather of riot, or of
unreasonable wast, then any necessary honorable change, so that there was daily
plucked and pilled from good and honest men great substance of goods, to be
lashed out among unthrifts, so far forth that fifteenes sufficed not, nor any
usual terms of known taxes, but under an easy name of benevolence and good
will, the commissioners took so much of every man, as no man would with his
good will have given. As though the name of benevolence had signified, that
every man should pay, not what he of himself of his good will list to grant,
but what the King of his good will list to take, who never asked little, but
every thing was haunsed above the measure, amercements turned into fines, fines
into treason, where I think that no man looks that we shall remember you of
examples by name, as though Burdet were forgotten, which was, for a word
spoken, in haste cruelly beheaded. (This Burdet was a Merchant dwelling in
Cheapeside at the sign of the Crown, which now is the sign of the
Flower-de-luce over against Soper-lane: This man merrily in the ruffling time of
King Edward the fourths reign, said to his own son, that he would make him
inheritor of the Crown, meaning his own house: but these words King Edward
made to be misconstrued, and interpreted that Burdet meant the Crown of the
Realm: wherefore within less space then four hours, he was apprehended,
judged, drawn and quartered in Cheapeside, by the misconstruing of the laws
of the Realm for the Princes pleasure; with no less honor to Markam chief
Justice then, which lost his office rathen then he would assent to that
judgment.

What need I to speak of sir Thomas Cook, Alderman and Mayor of this noble
City? who is of you either for negligence that wotteth not, or so forgetful
that he remembers not, or so hard-hearted that he pittieth not that
worshipful man's loss? what speak I of loss, his wonderful spoil and
undeserved destruction, only because it happened him to favor them whom the
Prince favored not. We need not rehearse of these any more by name, since I
doubt not that here be many present, that either in themselves or their nigh
friends, as well their goods as their persons, were greatly endangered either by
fained quarrels or small matters aggravated with heinous names, and also there
was no crime so great, of which there could lack a pretext. For since the King
preventing the time of his inheritance, attained the Crown by battle, it
sufficed in a rich man for a pretext of treason, to have been of kindred or
aliance, near of familiarity, or longer of acquaintance with any of those,
that were at any time the Kings enemies, which was at one time or another more
then half the Realm. Thus were neither your goods nor lands in surety, and yet
they brought your bodies in jeopardie, besides the common adventure of open
war; which albeit, that it is ever the will and occasion of much mischief,
yet it is never so mischievous, as where any people fall in division (...)
distance among themselves and in no Realm earthly so deadly and so pes^ilent,
as when it happens amongst us. And among us never contiued so long
dissension, nor so many battles in any season, nor so cruel nor so deadly
fought as were in the Kings days that is dead. In whose time and by whose
occasion, what about the getting of the Garland, keeping it, leesing and
winning it again, it has cost more English blood then has the twice winning
of France. In which inward war amongst our selves has been so great effusion
of the ancient noble blood of this Realm, that scarcely the half remains,
to the great enfeebling of this noble land; besides many a good town ransaked
and spoiled by them that have been going to the field, or returning from
thence, and peace after, not much surer then war. So that no time was there
in the which rich men for their money, and great men for their lands, or some
other for some fear or for some displeasure were out of peril. For whom
trusted he that mistrusted his own brother? Whom spared he that killed his
own Brother? Could not such manner of folk that he most favored do somewhat
(we shall for his honor spare to speak) howbeit, this you know well all,
that whosoever was best, bare ever the least rule, and more suite in his days was
to Shores wife, a vile and abominable strumpet, then to all the Lords in
England, except unto those that made her their Protector, which simple woman
was yet well named and honest, till the King for his wanton lust and sinful
affection bereft her of her Husband, a right honest man and substantial
amongst you. And in that point, which in good faith I am sorry to speak of,
saving that it is vain to keep in Counsel that thing that all men know, the
Kings greedy appetite was insatiable, and every where over all the Realm
intolerable. For no woman was there any where, young or old, poor or rich, whom
he set his eye upon, whom he any thing liked, either for person or beauty,
speech, pace or countenance, but without any fear of God, or respect of his
Honor, murmr, or grudging of the world, he would importunately pursue his
appetite and have her, to the great destruction of many a good woman, and great
dolor to their husbands and friends, which being honest people of themselves,
so much regarded the cleanness of their houses, the chastity of their wives
and children, that they had rather lose all that they had besides, then to have
such a villainy done to them.

And albeit, that with this and other importable dealing, the Realm was in
every place annoyed, yet specially you the Citizens of this Nobility, as for
that amongst you is most plenty of such things as minister matter to such
injuries, as for that you were nearest hand, since that near here about was his
most common abiding. And yet be ye a people whom he had as singular a cause
well and truly to entreat, as any part of his Realm: not only for that the
Prince by this Noble City, as of his special Chamber and renouned City of
this Realm, receives much honorable fame amongst all other Nations, but also
for that, you not without your great cost and sundry favors and dangers in all
his wars, bare ever your especial favor to his part: which your kind
minds borne to the house of York, since he has nothing worthily requirid
you, there is of the house now which by Gods grace shall make you full
recompense, which thing to show you, is the whole sum and effect of our
arrand. It shall not need I hope, to rehearse unto you again that you have
already heard of him that can better tell it, and of whom I am sure ye will
better believe it, (and reason it is that it should be so) I am not so proud
to look therefore that you should receive my words of so great authority as
the Preachers of the word of God, namely a man so cunning and so wise, that no
man knows better what he should do and say, and thereto so good and
virtuous that he would not say the thing, which he ought not to say in the
pulpit, namely, into the which no honest man comes to lie: which honorable
preacher, ye well remember, substantially declared to you at Paul's Cross on
Sunday last past, the right and title of the most excellent Prince Richard Duke
of Gloucester, now Protector of this his Realm, which he has unto the Crown
of the Kingdom of the same. For that worshipful man made it perfectly and
groundedly open unto you. The children of King Edward the fourth were never
lawfully begotten, for as much as the King (leaving his very wife Dame
Elizabeth Lucy) was never lawfully married to the Queen their mother, whose
blood, saving he set his voluptuous pleasure before his honor, was full
unmeetly to be matched with his (the mingling of which two bloods together,
has been the effusion of a great part of the noble blood of this Realm)
whereby it may well be seen, that marriage was not well made, of which there
is so much mischief grown. For lack of which lawful copulation, and also of
other things which the said worshipful Doctor, rather signified then fully
explained, and which thing shall not be spoken for me, as the thing that every
man forbeareth to say that he knows, in avoiding the displeasure that my
noble Lord Protector, bearing, as nature requires a filial reverence to the
Duchess his Mother. For these causes before remembered, I say that for lack of
issue lawfully coming of the late noble Prince Richard Duke of York, to whose
Royal blood the Crowns of England and of France, are by the high authority of
a parliament entailed, the right and title of the same is by just course of
inheritance according to the common law of this land, devolved and come unto
the most excellent Prince the Lord Protector, as to the very lawful begotten
son of the fore-remembred noble Duke of York. Which thing well considered,
and the knightly prowess with many virtues which in his noble person
singularly do abound; The Nobles and Commons of this Realm, and specially of
the North parts, not willing any bastard blood to have the rule of the land,
nor theabuses in the same before used and exercised any longer to continue,
have fully condescended and utterly determined to make humble petition unto the
puisant Prince the Lord Protector, that it may like his grace at our humble
request, to take upon him the guiding and government of this Realm, to the
wealth and increase of the same, according to his very right and just title;
which thing, I know well he will be loath to take upon him, as he whose
wisdom well perceives, the labor and study both of mind and body that shall
come therewith to him, whosoever shall occupy that rome. I dare say he will, if
he take it (for I warrant you that that room is no childs office) and that
the great wise man well perceived when he said Vae regno, cujus Rex puer est,
woe to that Realm whose King is a child; wherefore so much the more cause have
we to thank God, that this noble personage which is so righteously entitled
thereto, is of so solid age* and thereto of so great wisdom, joined with so
great experience, which albeit, he will be loath as I have said, to take upon
him, yet shall he to our petition in that behalf the more graciously inclin
if ye the worshipful Citizens of this City, being the chief city of the
Realm, join with us the nobles in our said request, which for your own weal
we doubt not but that ye will. And yet nevertheless, we pray yo^ so to do,
whereby ye shall do great profit to all this his Realm: Beside that, in
choosing them so good a King, it shall be to your self a special commodity,
to whom his Majesty shall ever after bear so much the more tender favor, in
how much he shall perceive you the more prone and benevolently minded toward
his election: wherein dear friends, what mind ye have we require you plainly
to show us: When the Duke had said, and looked that the people whom he hoped
that the Mayor had framed before, should after this flattering proposition
made, have cried King Richard, King Richard, all was still and mute, and not
one word answered unto: wherewith the Duke was marvellously abashed, and taking
the Major near to him, with other that were about him privy to the matter,
said unto them softly; What means this, that the people be so still? Sir,
quoth the Major, perhaps they perceive you not well; that shall we amend, quoth
he, if that will help, and therewith somewhat louder rehearsed the same matter
again, in other and other words, so well and orderly, and nevertheless so
evidently and plain, with voice, gesture, and countenance so comely and so
convenient, that every man much marvelled that heard him, and thought that they
never heard in their lives so evil a tale so well told. But were it for fear,
or that each looked that other should speak first, not one word was there
answered of all the people that stood before but all were as still as the
midnight, not so much as whispering among them, by which they might seem once
to commune what was best to do. When the Major saw this, he with other
partners of the Council, drew about the Duke and said, that the people had not
been accustomed there to be spoken unto, but by the Recorder, which is the
mouth the City, and happily to him they will answer. With that the Recorder,
called Thomas Fitz-William, a solid man and an honest, which was but newly come
to the office, and never had spoken to the people before, and loath he was with
that matter to begin, notwithstanding, being thereunto commanded by the
Major, made a rehearsal to the commons of that which the Duke had twice
proposed himself; but the Recorder so tempered his tale, that he showed every
thing as the Dukes words were, and no part of his own, but all this made no
change in the people, which all as one stood as they had been amassed.
Whereupon, the Duke whispered with the Major, and said, this is a mavelous
obstinate silence, and therewith turned to the people again with these words:
Dear friends, we come to move you to that thing which peradventure we
greatly needed not, but that the Lords of this Realm, and commons of other
parts might have sufficed, saving such love we bear you, and so much set by
you, that we would not gladly do without you, that thing in which to be
partners is your weal and honor, which as to us seems you see not, or weigh
not: Wherefore we require you to give us an answer, one or other, whether ye
be minded, as all the Nobles of the Realm be* to have this Noble Prince now
Protector to be your King? And at these words the people began to whisper among
themselves secretly, that the voice was neither loud nor base, but like a
swarm of bees till at the last at the nether end of the hall a company of the
Dukes servants and one Nashfield, and others belonging to the Protector, with
some prentises and lads that thrusted themselves into the hall amongst the
preasse, began suddenly at men's backs to cry out as loud as they could, King
Richard, King Richard; and there threw up their cappes in token of joy, and
they that stood before cast back their heads marvelling thereat, but nothing
they said. And when the Duke and the Major saw this manner, they wisely turned
it to their purpose, and said it was a goodly cry and a joyful, to hear every
man with one voice, and no man saying nay. Wherefore friends (quoth the Duke,)
since we perceive that it is all your whole minds to have this noble man for
your King, whereof we shall make his grace so effectual report that we doubt
not but that it shall redound to your great wealth and commodity. We
therefore require you, that to morrow ye go with us, and we with you to his
Noble Grace to make our humble Petition and request to him in manner before
remmebred. And therewith the Lords came down, and the company dissolved and
departed, the most part all sad, some with glad semblance that were not very
merry, and some of them that came with the Duke, not able to dissemble their
sorrow, were feign even at his back to turn their face to the wall, while the
dolor of their hearts brast out of their eyes.

Then on the morrow the Major and Aldermen, and chief commanders of the City
in their best manner aparelled, assembling them together at Paul's, resorted to
Baynards Castle where the Protector lay, to which place also according to the
appointment repaired the Duke of Bu^kingham, and diverse nobles with him,
besides many Knights and Gentlemen. And thereupon the Duke sent word to the
Lord Protector of the being thereof a great honorable company to move a great
matter to his Grace. Whereupon the Protector made great difficulty to come
down to them, except he knew some part of their errand, as though he
doubted, and partly mistrusted the company of such a number to him so suddenly,
without any warning or knowledge, whether they came for good or harm. Then
when the Duke had showed this to the Major and others, that they might thereby
see how little the Protector looked for this matter; they sent again by the
messenger, such loving message, and therewith so humbly besought him to
vouchsafe that they might resort to his presence to propose their intent, of
which they would to no other person disclose any part; At the last he came out
of his chamber, and yet not down to them, but in a galery over them, with a
Bishop on each hand of him, where they beneath might see him and speak to him,
as though he would not yet come near them, till he knew what they meant. And
thereupon, the Duke of Buckingham first made humble petition to him on the
behalf of them all, that his grace would pardon them, and license them to show
unto his grace the intent of their coming without his displeasure; without
which pardon obtained, they durst not be so bold to moove him of that matter.
In which, albeit they meant as much honor to his grace, as wealth to all the
Realm besides, yet were they not sure how his grace would take it, whom in no
wise they would offend. Then the Protector, as he was very gentle of himself,
and also longed sore apparently to know what they meant, gave him leave to
deliver his message, verily trusting for the good mind that he bare unto them
all, none of them would intend any thing to his hurt, wherewith he thought to
be grieved. When the Duke had this leave and pardon to speak, then waxed he
bold to show him their intent and purpose, with all the causes moving them
thereunto, as ye before have heard. And finally, to beseech his grace that it
would like him of his accustomed goodness and zeal unto the Realm, now with
his eye of pity to behold the long continued distress and decay of the same,
and set his gracious hand to the redress and amendment thereof, by taking upon
him the Crown of the Realm according to his right and title lawfully
descended unto him, and to the laud of God, profit and surety of the Land, and
unto his grace so much the more honor and less pain, in that that never
prince reigned upon any people that were so glad to live under his obeisance,
as the people of this realm under his.

When the Protector had heard the Proposition* he looked very strangely there
at, and made answer, that albeit he knew partly the things by them alleged to
be true, yet such entire love he bare to King Edward and his children, and
much more regarded his honor in other Realms about, then the crown of any
one, of which he was never desirous, for in all other nations where the truth
were not well known, it should peradventure be thought that it were his own
ambitious mind and device to depose the Prince, and to take the Crown
himself; with which infamy he would in no wise have his honor stained for
any crown, in which he ever had perceived much more labor and pain, then
pleasure to him that so would use it, as he that would not and were not worthy
to have it. Notwithstanding, he not only pardoned them of the motion that
they made him, but also thanked them for the love and hearty favor they bare
him, praying them for his sake to bear the same to the Prince under whom he
was and would be content to live, and with his labor and counsel, as far as
it should like the King to use it, he would do his uttermost devoir to set the
Realm in good estate which was already in the little time of his Protectorship
(praised be God) well begun, in that the malice of such as were before the
occasion of the contrary, and of new intended to be, were now partly by good
policy, partly more by Gods providence, then man's provision, repressed and put
under.

Upon this answer given, the Duke of Buckingham by the Protectors license a
little rounded, as well with other noble men about him as with the Major and
Recorder of London. And after that upon like pardon desired and obtained, he
showed alowd unto the Protector, for a final conclusion, that the Realm was
determined that King Edwards line should no longer reign over them, both that
they had so far gone, that it was now no surety to retreat (as for that they
thought it the best way for the whole Realm, although they had not yet begun
it) Wherefore if it would like his Grace to take the Crown upon him, they
would humbly beseech him thereunto, and if he would give them a resolute answer
to the contrary (which they would be loath to hear) then must they seek, and
should not fail to find some other noble man that would. These words much
moved the Protector, which, as every man of small intelligence may judge, would
never have inclined thereto: but when he saw there was no other way but that he
must take it, or else he and his both to go from it, he said to Lords and
Commons, since it is, we perceive well, that all the Realm is so set (whereof
we be very sorry) that they will not suffer in any wise King Edward* his line
to govern them, whom no man earthly can govern against their wills: And we
also perceive that there is no man to whom the Crown can by so just title
appertain as to our self, as very right heir lawfully begotten of the body
of our most dread and dear Father Richard late Duke of York, to which title
is now joined your election, the nobles and commons of the Realm, which we of
all titles possibly take for most effectual, we be content and agree
favorably to incline to your petition and request, and according to the same,
here we take upon us the Royal estate of pre-eminence and Kingdom of the two
Noble Realms, England and France, the one from this day forward by us and our
heirs to rule, govern, and defend, the other by God his grace and your good
help to get again, subdue and establish for ever in due obedience unto this
realm of England, the advancement whereof, we never ask of God longer to live
then we intend to procure and set forth. With this there was a great cry and
shout, crying King Richard, and so the Lords went up to the King, and so he
was after that day so called. But the people departed talking diversely of the
matter, every man as his fantacie gave him, but much they marvelled of this
manner of delaying, that the matter was on both parts made so strange, as
though never the one part had communed with the other part thereof before, when
they knew that there was no man so dull that heard them, but he perceived well
enough that all the matter was made between them. Howebeit, some excused that
again, saying; all things must be done in good order, and men must sometimes
for the manner sake not be known what they know* For at the consecration of a
Bishop, every man perceives by payment of his Bulls that he intends to be
one, yet when he is twice asked whether he will be a Bishop, he must twice
say nay, and at the third time take it upon him as compelled thereto by his
own will. And in a stage play, the people know right well that he that
plays the Sultan, is perhaps a cobbler yet if one of his acquaintance perhaps
of little nurture should call him by his name while he stands in his
Majesty, one of his tormentors might fortune to break his head for marring the
play. And so they said, these matters be Kings games, as it were stage plays,
and for the most part played upon scaffolds, in which poor men be but lookers
on, and they that be wise, will meddle no further, for they that step up with
them, when they cannot play their parts, they disorder the play, and do
themselves no good.

THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF THE LIFE AND REIGN OF RICHARD THE THIRD.

Written by the Right Honorable Sir Thomas Moore, Lord Chancellor of England.

LONDON, Printed by T. Pain and M. Simmons. 1641.

THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF KING RICHARD THE THIRD.
I Am loath to remember, but more I abhor to write, the misery of this
unfortunate King, which by fraud entered, by tyranny proceeded, and by sudden
death ended his unfortunate life: But if I should not declare the flagicious
facts of the evil Kings, as well as I have done the notable acts of virtuous
Kings, I should neither animate, nor encourage rulers of Realms, Countries,
and Seigniories to follow the steps of their profitable Progenitors, for to
attain to the type of honor and worldly fame: neither yet advertise Kings
being prone to vice and wickedness, to avoid and expel all sin and
mischief, for dread of obloquie and worldly shame: for contrary set to
contrary is more apparent, as white joined to black makes the fayrer show:
Wherefore, I will proceed in his acts after my accustomed usage.

Richard, the third of that name, usurped the Crown of England, and openly
took upon him to be King, the ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord,
one thousand four hundred fourscore and three, and in the twenty fifth year
of Lewis the eleventh then being the King of France: and the morrow after, he
was Proclaimed King, and with great solemnity rode to Westminster, and there
(...) in the seat Royal, and called the Judges of the Realm before him,
staightly commanding them to execute the Laws without favor or delay, with
many good exhortations (of the which he followed not one) and then he
departed toward the Abbey, and at the Church door he was met with Procession,
and there was delivered to him by the Abbot the Scepter of Saint Edward, and so
went and offered to Saint Edwards shrine, while the Monks sang Te deum with a
faint courage; and from the Church he returned to the Palace, where he lodged
till the Coronation. And to be sure of all enemies (as he thought) he sent
for five thousand men out of the North against his Coronation, which came up
evil apparelled and worse harnessed, in rusty harness, neither defensable nor
scoured to the sale, which mustered in Finsbury fi^ld, to the great disdain of
all the lookers on.

The fourth day of July he came to the Tower by water with his wife, and the
fifth day he created Edward his only begotten son, a child of ten years
old, Prince of Wales, and John Haward, a man of great knowledge and virtue
(as well in council as in battle) he created Duke of Norfolk, and sir Thomas
Haward his son he created Earl of Surry, and William Lord Barkeley was then
created Earl of Notingham, and Francis Lord Lovell was then made Vicount
Lovell, and the Kings Chamberlain, and Lord Stanley was delivered out of ward
for fear of his son the Lord Strange, which was then in Lancashire gathering
men (as men said) and the said Lord was made Steward of the Kings household;
likewise the Archbishop of York was delivered: But Morton Bishop of Ely, was
deliverd to the Duke of Buckingham to keep in ward, who sent him to his manor
of Brecknoke in Wales, from whence he escaped to King Richards confusion. The
same night the King made seventeene Knights of the Bath. The next day he road
through London with great pomp, and especially the Duke of Buckingham was
richly apparelled, and his horse trapped in blew velvet embroidered with the
naves of carts burning of gold: which trapper was borne by footmen from the
ground, with such solemn fashion, that all men much admired it.

On the morrow being the sixth day of July, the King came toward his Coronation
into Westminster Hall, where his Chapel and all the Prelates mitered received
him* And so they in order of Procession passed forward: After the Procession
followed the Earl of Northumberland with a pointlesse sword naked, and the
Lord Stanley bore the Mace of the Constableship. The Earl of Kent bore the
second sword on the right hand of the King naked. The Lord Lovell bore an other
sword on the left hand. Then followed the Duke of Suffolk with the Scepter,
and the Earl of Lincoln with the Ball and Cross. After them followed the new
Earl of Surrey with the sword of Estate in a rich scabbard. On the right side
of him went the Duke of Norfolk bearing the Crown: then followed King Richard
in a Circot and robe of purple velvet under a Canopie borne by the barrons of
the five Ports, going between the Bishops of Bathe and Duresme. The Duke of
Buckingham with the rod of the high Steward of England bare the Kings train.
After him followed the Earl of Huntington, bearing the Queens Scepter, and
the Vicount Lisle, bearing the rod with the Dove. And the Earl of Wiltshire
bare the Queens Crown. Then followed Queen Anne daughter to Richard Earl of
Warwick, in robes like to the King, between two Bishops, and a canopie over
her head, borne by the Barons of the Ports. On her head a rich Coronall set
with stones and pearls. After her followed the countess of Richmond heir to
the Duke of Somerset, which bare up the Queens train. After followed the
Duchess of Suffolk and Norfolk with Countesses, Barronesses, Ladies, and many
fair Gentlewomen: in this order they passed through the palace, and entered the
Abbie at the West end, and so came to their seats of estate. And after diverse
songs solemly sung, they both descended to the high Altar, and were shifted
from their robes, and had diverse places open from the middle upward, in which
places they were anointed. Then both the King and the Queen changed them into
clothes of gold, and ascended to their seats, where the Cardinal of
Canterbury and other Bishops Crowned them according to the old custom of the
Realm, giving him the Scepter in his left hand, and the ball with the cross
in the right hand, and the Queen had the Scepter in her right hand, and the
rod with the Dove in the left hand: On every side of the King stood a Duke, and
before him stood the Earl of Surrey with the sword in his hands. And on every
side of the Queen standing a Bishop and a Lady kneeling. The Cardinal sung
the Mass, and after paxe; The King and the Queen descended, and before the
high Altar they were both houseled with one host divided between them. After
Mass finished, they both offered at Saint Edwards shrine, and there the King
left the Crown of Saint Edward, and put on his own Crown. And so in order as
they came, they departed to Westminster Hall, and so to their chambers for a
season, during which time the Duke of Norfolk came into the Hall, his horse
trapped to the ground in cloth of gold as high Marshall, and voyded the Hall.

About four of the clock the King and Queen entered into the Hall, and the
King sat in the middle, and the Queen on the left hand of the table and on
every side of her a Countess holding a cloth of pleasance, when she list to
drink. And at the right hand of the King sat the Bishop of Canterbury, the
Ladies sat all on one side in the middle of the Hall, and at the table against
the^ sat the Chancellor and all the Lords. At the Table next the cupboord
sat the Major of London. And at the Table behind the Lords, sat the Barons of
the Ports. And at the other boords sat Noble and Worshipful personages. When
all persons were set, the Duke of Norfolk Earl Marshall, the Earl of Surrey,
Constable for that day, the Lord Stanl^y Lord Steward, sir Will^am Hopton
Treasurer, and sir Thomas Percy Controler, came in and served the King solemnly
with one dish of gold, and another of silver. And the Queen all in gilt
vessels, and the Bishops all in silver. At the second course came into the
Hall, sir Robert Democke the Kings champion, making a Proclamation, that
whosoever would say that King Richard was not lawfully King, he would fight
with him at the utterance, and threw down his Gauntlet: and then all the Hall
cried out King Richard. And so he did in three parts of the Hall, and then one
brought him a cup of wine coverd, and when he had drank he cast out the wine,
and departed with the cup. After that, the Heralds cried a largess thrice in
the Hall, and so went up to their stage. At the end of dinner, the Major of
London served the King and Queen with sweet wine, and had of each of them a
cup of gold with a cover of gold. And by that time that all was done, it was
darkenight: and so the King returned to his chamber, and every man to his
lodging. When this feast was thus finished, the King sent home all the Lords
into their countries that would depart, except the Lord Stanley, whom he
retained till he heard what his son the Lord Strange went about. And to such
as went home, he gave straight charge and commandment to see their Countries
well ordered, and that no wrong nor extortion should be done to his subjects.
And thus he taught others to execute justice and equity, the contrary whereof
he daily exercised: he also with great rewards given to the Northern men
which he sent for to his Coronation, sent them home to their Country with
great thanks. Whereof diverse of them, (as they all be of nature very greedy
of authority, and especially when they think to have any comfort or favor,)
took on them so highly, and wrought such Masteries, that the King was feign to
ride thither in his first year, and to put some in execution, and stay the
Country, or else no small mischief had ensued.

Incontinent after this, he sent a solemn Embassage to Lewis the French King,
to conclude a league and amity with him, trusting also to obtain the tribute
which King Edward his brother had before out of France: but the French King so
abhorred him and his cruelty, that he would neither see nor hear his
Ambassadors, and so in vain they returned.

Now after this triumphant Coronation there fell mischiefs thick and thick,
and as the thing evil gotten is never well kept, so through all the time of
his usurped reign, never ceased there cruel murder, death and slaughter,
till his own destruction ended it. But as he finished with the best death and
most fitting, that is to say his own, so began he with the most pitteous and
wicked, I mean the lamentable murder of his innocent Nephews, the young King
and his tender brother, whose death and final fortune has nevertheless so
far come in question that some remained long in doubt whether they were in
his days destroyed or no. Not for that that Parkin Warbeck by many folks
folly so long space abusing the world* was as well with Princes as with poor
people reputed and taken for the younger of these two: But for that also that
all things were so covertly demeaned, one thing pretended, and another meant,
that there was nothing so plain and openly proved, but that yet for the common
custom of close covert dealing, men had it ever inwardly suspect, as many well
counterfeit jewels make the true mistrusted. Howbeit, concerning that opinion,
men may see the conveiance thereof in the Noble Prince King Henry the seventh,
in the process of Parkin. But in the mean season, for this present matter I
shall rehearse to you the dolorous end of these two babes, not after every way
that I have heard, but after that way that I have so heard by such men and such
means, as I think it to be hard but it should be true.

King Richard after his Coronation, taking his way to Gloucester, The
destruction of King Edwards Children.
to visit in his new honor the town, of which he bare the name of old,
devised as he road to fulfill that thing which he before had intended. And
forasmuch as his mind gave him that his Nephews living, men would not recon
that he could have right to the Realm* he thought therefore without delay to
rid them, as though the killing of his kinsmen might end his cause, and make
him kindly King. Whereupon he sent John Green, whom he specially trusted, unto
sir Robert Brakenbury Constable of the Tower, with a letter and credence also,
that the same sir Robert in any wise should put the two children to death. This
John Green did his errand to Brakenbury, kneeling before our Lady in the
Tower, who plainly answered that he would never put them to death to dye
therefore. With the which answer Green returned, recompting the same to King
Richard at Warwick yet on his journey, wherewith he took such displeasure
and thought, that the same night he said to a secret page of his: Ah, whom
shall a man trust? they that I have brought up my self, they that I thought
would have most surely served me, even those fail me, and at my commandment
will do nothing for me. Sir, quoth the page, there lies one in the palet
chamber without, that I dare say, will do your Grace pleasure, the thing were
right hard that he would refuse, meaning this by James Tirell, which was a man
of a goodly personage, and for the gifts of nature worthy to have served a much
better Prince, if he had well served God, and by grace obtained to have as much
truth and good will, as he had strength and wit. The man had an high heart and
sore longed upward, not rising yet so fast as he had hoped, being hindered and
kept under by sir Richard Ratcliffe, and sir William Catesbey, which longing
for no more partners of the Princes favor, namely not for him, whose pride
they knew would bear no peer, kept him by secret drifts out of all secret
trust: which thing this page had well marked and knew: wherefore this occasion
offered, of very special friendship spied his time to set him forward, and in
such wise to do him good, that all the enemies that he had (except the devil)
could never have done him so much hurt and shame; for upon the pages words,
King Richard arose (for this communication had he sitting on a draft, a
convenient carpet for such a council) and came out into the palet chamber,
where he did find in bed the said James Tyrell and sir Thomas Tyrell, of
person like, and brethren of blood, but nothing of kin in conditions. The^
said the King merrily, what sirs, be you in bed so soon? and called up James
Tyrell, and brake to him secretly his mind in this mischievous matter, in the
which he found him nothing strange. Wherefore on the morrow he sent him to
Brakinbury with a letter, by the which he was commanded to deliver to the said
James all the keys of the Tower for a night, to the end that he might there
accomplish the Kings pleasure in such things as he there had given him in
commandment. After which letter delivered, and the keys received, James
appointed the next night ensuing to destroy them, devising before and preparing
the means.

The Prince as soon as the Protector took upon him to be King, and left the
name of Protector, was thereof advertised and showed, that he should not
reign, but his Uncle should have the Crown. At which word the Prince sore
abashed, began to sigh and say: Alas I would mine Uncle would let me have my
life although I leese my Kingdom. Then he that told him the tale used him with
good words, and put him in the best comfort that he could, but forthwith he
and his brother were both shut up, and all other removed from them, one called
Black Will, or William Slaughter only except, which were set to serve them,
and four other to see them sure. After which the the Prince never tied his
points, nor any thing regarded himself, but with that young babe his brother
lingered in thought and heaviness, till this traiterous deed delivered the^
of that wretchedness.

For James Tirrell devised that they should be murdered in their beds, and no
blood shed: to the execution whereof, he appointed Miles Forest, one of the
four that before kept them, a fellow flesh-bred in murder before time: and to
him he joined one John Dighton his own horsekeeper, a big, broad, square, and
strong knave. Then all the other being removed from them, King Edwards Children
murdered
this Miles Forest and John Dighton about midnight, the silly children lying in
their beds, came into the chamber, and suddenly lapped them up amongst the
clothes, and so bewrapped them, keeping down by force the fetherbed and
pillowes hard under their mouths, that within a while they smothered and
stifled them, and their breaths failing, they gave up to God their innocent
souls into the joys of heaven, leaving to the tormenters their bodies dead in
the bed, which after the wretches perceived, first by the struggling with the
pang of death, and after long lying still, to be through dead, they laid the
bodies out upon the bed, and fetched James Tirrell to see them, which when he
saw them perfectly dead, he caused the murderers to bury them at the stayre
foot, meetly deep in the ground, under a heap of stones.

Then rode James Tirrell in great haste to King Richard, and showed him all the
manner of the murder, who gave him thanks, and as men say, there made him
Knight, but he allowed not their burial in so vile a corner, saying; that he
would have them buried in a better place, because they were a Kings sons: Lo
the honorable courage of a King, for he would recompense a detestable murder
with a solemn obsequie. Whereupon a priest of Sir Robert Brakenburies took
them up and buried them in such a place secretly as by the occasion of his
death (which was shortly after) which only knew it, the very truth could never
yet be very well and perfectly known. For some say that King Richard caused
the Priest to take them up and close them in lead and to put them in a coffin
full of holes, hooked at the ends with two hooks of iron, and so to cast them
into a place called the Black deepes at the Thames mouth, so that they should
never rise up nor be seen again. This was the very truth unknown, by reason
that the said Priest died so shortly and disclosed it never to any person that
would utter it. And for a truth, when sir James Tirrell was in the Tower for
treason committed to King Henry the seventh, both he and Dighton were examined
together of this point, and both they confessed the murder to be done in the
same manner as you have heard, but whither the bodies were removed, they both
affirmed they never knew. And thus as I have learned of them that knew much,
and little cause had they to lie, where these two noble Princes, these innocent
tender children, borne of the most royal blood, and brought up in great
wealth, likely long to live, to reign and rule in the Realm, by traiterous
tyranny taken and deprived of their estate, shortly shut up in Prison and
privily slain and murdered by the cruel ambition of their unnatural Uncle
and his dispiteous tormenters: which things on every part well pondered, God
gave this world never a more notable example, either in what unsurety stands
this worlds weal, or what mischief works the proud enterprise of an high
heart, or finally, what wretched end insueth such dispiteous cruelty.

For first to begin with the Ministers, Miles Forest, at Saint Martins le
grant, by piece meals miserably rotted away: John Dighton, lived at Caleys
long after, no less disdained and hated then pointed at, and there dyed in
great misery: But sir James Tirrell was beheaded on the Tower hill for
Treason: And King Richard himself was slain in the field, hacked and hewn by
his enemies hands, hurried on a horse back naked being dead, he is here in
despite torn and tugged like a curre dog. And the mischief that he took
within less then three years, of the mischief that he dyed in three months
be not comparable, and yet all the mean time spent in much trouble and pain
outward, and much fear, dread, and anguish within. For I have heard by
credible report of such as were secret with his chamberers, that after this
abominable deed done, he never was quiet in his mind, he never thought
himself sure where he went abroad, his body privily fainted, his eye wherled
about, his hand ever on his dagger, his countenance and manner like always to
strike again, he took ill rest on nights, lay long waking and musing, for
wearied with care and watch, rather slumbred then slept, troubled with
fearful dreams, suddenly sometime start up, leap out of his bed and look
about the chamber; so was his restless heart continually tossed and tumbled
with the tedious impression and stormy remembrance of his abominable murder
and execrable Tyranny.

King Richard by this abominable mischief and scelerous act, thinking himself
well relieved both of fear and thought, would not have it kept council but
within a few days caused it to run in a common rumor that the two children
were suddenly dead, and to this intent as it is to be deemed, that now no heir
Male being alive of King Edwards body lawfully begotten, the people would be
content with the more patient heart and quiet mind, to obey him and suffer his
rule and governance: but when the same of this detestable fact was revealed,
and divulged through the whole Realm, there fell generally such a dolor and
inward sorrow into the hearts of all the people, that all fear of his cruelty
set a side, they in every Town, street, and place, openly wept, and pittiously
sobbed. And when their sorrow was somewhat mitigate, their inward grudge could
not refrain but cry out in places public and also private, furiously saying,
what creature of all creatures is so malicious and so obstinate an enemy either
to God, or to Christian Religion, or to humane Nature, which would not have
abhorred, or at the least abstained from so miserable a murder of so execrable
a tyranny? To murder a man is much odious, to kill a woman, is in manner
unnatural, but to slay and destroy innocent Babes, and young Infants, the
whole world abhors, and the blood from the earth cries to Almighty God for
vengeance. If the common people cried out, I assure you the friends of the
Queen and her children, made no less exclamation and complaint with loud
voice* lamentably crying and saying, alas what will ^e do to others, that thus
shamefully murdereth his own blood without cause or desert? whom will he
save, when he slays the poor Lambs committed to him in trust? now we see
and behold, that the most cruel tyranny has invaded the Commonwealth; now we
see that in him is neither hope of Justice nor trust of Mercy, but abundance of
cruelty and thirst of innocent blood.

But when this news was first brought to the unfortunate mother of the dead
children yet being in Sanctuary, no doubt but it struck to her heart, like the
sharp dart of death; for when she was first informed of the murder of her
two Sons, she was suddenly amazed with the greatness of the cruelty, that
for fear she sounded and fell down to the ground, and there lay in a great
agony like to a dead corpse. And after that she came to her memory, and was
revived again, she wept and sobbed, and with pitiful scrieches she
replenished the whole Mansion, her breast she struck, her fair hair she
tore, and pulled in pieces, and being overcome with sorrow and pensiveness,
rather desired death then life, calling by name diverse times her sweet Babes,
accounting her self more then mad, that she deluded by wile and fraudulent
promises, delivered her younger son out of the Sanctuary to his enemy to be
put to death, thinking that next the oath made to God broken, and the duty of
allegiance toward her children violated, she of all creatures in that point was
most seduced and deceived. After long lamentation, when she saw no hope of
revenging otherwise, she kneeled down and cried on God to take vengeance for
the deceitful perjury, as who said she nothing mistrusted but once he would
remember it. What is he living, that if he remember and behold these two
noble infants without deserving, so shamefully murdered, that will not abhor
the fact, yea and be moved and tormented with pity and mercy. And yet the
world is so frail, and our nature so blind, that few be stirred with such
examples, obliviously forgetting, and little considering, that oftentimes for
the offenses by the Parents perpetrate and committed, that sin is punished in
their line and posterity. This chance might so happen to these innocent
children, because King Edward their Father and Parent offended in staining his
conscience: he made his solemn oath before the Gate of the City of York (as
you have heard before) and promised and swear one thing by his word, thinking
clean contrary in his heart, as after did appear. And afterward by the death
of the Duke of Clarence his brother, he incurred (of likelihood) the great
displeasure toward God.

After this murder thus perpetrated, and that he had visited his Town of
Gloucester, which he for his old Dignity both loved and with ample liberties
and privileges endowed and decorated, he took his journey toward the County of
York, where the people abusing his lawful favor (as he both favored and
trusted them in his heart) had of late presumed to attempt diverse routs and
riots contray to his laws, and infringing of his peace, and upon hope of his
maintenance, were so elated, that no Lord, were he never of so great power,
could either pacify or rule them, till the King himselfelfe came personally
thither, to set a concord and an unity in that Country, and to bridle and rule
the rude rusticall and blustering bold people of that region, and so he by long
journeying came to the City of York, where the Citizens received him with
great pomp and triumph, according to the qualities* of their education, and
quantity of their substance and ability, and made diverse days, plays, and
Pageants in token of joy and solace. Wherefore King Richard magnified and
applauded of the North Nation, and also to show himself apparently before them
in habit royal with Scepter in hand and Diadem on his head, made Proclamation,
that all persons should resort to York on the day of the Ascension of our
Lord, where all men should both behold and see him, his Queen and Prince in
their high estates and degrees, and also for their good wills, should have
received many thanks, large benefits and magnificent rewards. At the day
appointed the whole clergy assembled in Copes richly vested, and so with a
reverent ceremony went about the city in procession, after whom followed the
King with his Crown and Scepter apparelled in his Circot robe royal
accompanied with no small number of the nobility of his Realm: after whom
marched in order Queen Anne his wife crowned, leading in her left hand Prince
Edward her son, having on his head a demi crown appointed for the degree of a
Prince. The King was had in that triumph in such honor and the common people
of the North so rejoiced that they extolled and praised him far above the
Stars. After this solemn feast and glorious pomp he kept great counselors
there, as well for the ordering of the country in time, as for the brideling
and punishing of such as there had misgoverned themselves: and further of the
gentlemen of that country, he augmented the number of his domestical Ministers
and servants, in the which persons he put his whole trust and affiance. When
all things were thus discreetly ordered, he returned by Notingham, and after
came to London: whom more for dread then for love, the Citezens received in
great companies.

Thus King Richard by a new invented cruelty, and late practiced tyranny,
obtained and grew to high praise and honor, and then by the admiration and
judgment of the common multitude, he was most esteemed to be exalted into
Heaven, when he covertly had intelligence, that he was like to loose his
estate, and could by no means have long continuance in his usurped power: for
assuredly after the death of King Edwards children, when any blustering wind,
perrilous thunder, or terrible tempest, chanced or were apparently like to
happen: Suddenly the people having in their fresh memory the facinorous act
of their King and Prince, would openly cry and make vociferation, that God did
take vengance and punish the poor Englishmen, for the crime and offense of
their ungratious King, whom they blamed, accursed and wished to have extreme
tortures. Although King Richard heard often of these slanderous words and
malicious sayings, and knew well by what persons they were spoken, yet he durst
not with strong hand be on the first inventors revenged, knowing that some
time it is no wisdom to refuse or disdain them that tell a ruler his duty
or declare to him his misbehaviour toward the common wealth, or counsel him
to amend and change his ill life. After this great felicity, he fell again
into a great fear and pensiveness of mind, and because he could by no means
either correct or amend things that were past, he determined by doing his duty
in all things to his commons, to obliterate and put out of memory that note of
infamy with the which his fame was justly spotted and stained, and to cause
the people to conceive so good an opinion of him, that from thence forth no
calamity nor trouble should be adjudged to happen to the common wealth, either
by his negligence or by his misgovernment (although it is difficile and strange
shortly to turn and pluck out such qualities and usages as have of long time
been incorporated in a man's mind, and rooted in his manners and conditions.)
Therefore whether it was for the performance of his former intent of amendment,
or (as common fame flew abroad) that he took repentance of his mischievous
acts and scelerate doings, he turned over the leaf, and began an order of a
new life, and pretended to have the name of a good and virtuous man, by the
reason that he showed himself more just, more meeker, more familiar, more
liberal (especially amongst the poor people) then before he had accustomed
to do; and so by this means he firmly trusted first to obtain of God
forgiveness of his offenses and crimes, and after to live and take away the
enemy and inward grudge that the common people bare in their minds toward
him, and in conclusion, to obtain their friendly love and assured favor. He
furthermore began and enterprised diverse things as well public as private, the
which he being prevented by sudden death did neither accomplish nor begin to
conclusion, for he ^egan to found a College of a hundred Priests, which
foundation with the founder shortly took an end. To please the common people
also, he in his high Court of Parliament enacted diverse and sundry good laws
and profitable statutes, and especially one against strangers and foren wrought
wares, not to be transported into this Realm, which commodious act for the
common wealth, if he had lived, he had fully purposed to have advanced and
set forward, and put in execution. But afterward evidently it appeared to all
persons, that only fear (which is not a master long in office and in
continual authority) and not justice, caused King Richard at that very time
to wax better, and amend his wicked and sinful life, for shortly after, the
goodness of the man which was but painted and fraudulent, suddenly waxed cold
and vanished away. And from thenceforth not only all his Counselors doings
and proceeding suddenly decayed and resorted to none effect: But also fortune
began to frown and turned her wheel downwards from him, in so much that he
lost his only begotten son Edward in the third month after he had created
him Prince of Wales.

The second year of his Reign.
ANd shortly after, in his second year of his reign he was unquieted by
conspiracy, or rather a confederacy between the Duke of Buckingham and many
other Gentlemen against him, as ye shall hear: But the occasion why the Duke
and the King fell out, is of diverse folk diversely pretended. This Duke as you
have heard before, as soon as the Duke of Gloucester after the death of King
Edward was come to York, and there had solemn funeral service done for King
Edward, sent to him a secret servant of his called Persall, with such messages
as you have heard before. And after the Duke of Buckingham came with three
hundred horse to Northampton, and still continued with him, as partner and
chief organ of his devices till after his Coronation, they departed, seeming
all to be very good friends at Gloucester. From whence as soon as the Duke
came home, he so highly conspired against him, that a man would marvel
whereof the change grew in so short a space. Some say this occasion was, that a
little before the Coronation, the Duke required the King amongst other things
to be restored to the Earl of Herfords lands: and forasmuch as the title
which he claymed by inheritance, was somewhat interlaced with the title of
Lancaster, which house made a title to the Crown, and enjoyed the same three
descents, as all men knew, till the house of York deprived the third King,
which was Henry the sixth, King Richard somewhat mistrusted and conceived such
an indignation, that he rejected the Dukes request, with many spiteful, and
minatorie words, which so wounded the Dukes heart with hatred and mistrust,
that he could never after endure to look right on King Richard, but ever
feared his own life, so far forth, that when the Protector should ride to
his Coronation, he feigned himself sick, because he would do him no honor.
And the other taking it in evil part, sent him word to rise and ride, or he
would make him to be carried. Whereupon, gorgeously apparelled, and sumptuously
trapped with burning cart navos of gold embrodered, he road before the King
through London with an evil will and worse heart. And that notwithstanding,
he rose the day of the Coronation from the feast, feining himself ficke,
which King Richard said was done in hate and dispight of him. And therefore men
said that each of them ever after lived continually in such hatred and distrust
of other, that the Duke looked verily to have been murdered at Gloucester,
from which he in fair manner departed: but surely* such as were right secret
with both* affirmed all this to be untrue; and otherwise men think it
unlikely, the deep dissembling nature of both these men well considered. And
what need in that green world the Protector had of the Duke, and in what
peril the Duke stood if he fell once in suspicion of that tyrant, that either
the Protector would give the Duke occasion of displeasure, or the Duke the
Protector occasion of mistrust. And surely men think, that if King Richard
had any such opinion conceived in him, he would never have suffered him to
avoid his hands or escape his power: but very true it is, that the Duke of
Buckingham was an high minded man, and ill could bear the glory of another, so
that I have heard of some that saw it, that he at such time as the Crown was
set upon the Protectors head, his eye could never abide the sight thereof, but
wryed his head another way, but men said he was not well at ease, and that was
both to King Richard well known and well taken, nor any demand of the Dukes
request uncurteously rejected, but gently deferred, but both he with great
gifts and high behestes in most loving and trusty manner departed from the King
to Gloucester. Thus every man judged as he thought, but soon after his coming
home to Brecknocke, having there by King Richards commandment Doctor Morton
Bishop of Ely, who before as you have heard, was taken at the Council at the
Tower, waxed with him very familiar, whose only wisdom abused his pride, to
his own deliverance, and the Dukes destruction. The Bishop was a man of great
natural wit, very well learned, and of honorable behavior, lacking no wise
ways to win favor. He was first upon the part of King Henry, while that part
was in wealth, and neither left it nor forsook it in woe, but fled the Realm
with the Queen and the Prince. And while King Edward had King Henry in prison,
he never returned but to the field at Barnet: after which field lost and
utterly subdued, and all par-takings extinguished, King Edward for his fast
faith and wisdom, was not only content to receive him, but also wooed him to
come, and had him from thenceforth both in secret trust and special favor,
whom he never deceived. For he being after King Edwards death first taken by
the tyrant for his truth to the King, found the means to set the Duke in his
top, and joined gentlemen together in aid of the Earl of Richmond, which
after was named King Henry the seven^h: First devising the marriage between
the Lady Elizabeth, daughter to King Edward the fourth, by the which his
faithful and true service declared to both his masters at once, was an
infinite benift to the Realm, by the conjunction of the bloods of Lancaster
and York, whose funeral titles had long unquieted the Realm. This man
afterward escaped from the Duke and fled the Realm, and never returned, and
went to Rome, never minded to meddle with the world, till King Henry the
seventh sent for him, and after made him Archbishop of Canterbury and
Chancellor of England, and after was made Cardinal, and lived well to all men's
judgments, and died well. But to return to the former purpose, he by the long
and often alternate proof, as well of prosperity as adverse fortune, had
gotten by great experience the very mother and mistress of wisdom, and deep
insight in politic and worldly drifts, whereby perceiving now the Duke to
commune with him, fed him with fair words and many praises, and perceiving by
the grief of their communications the Dukes pride now and then to balke out a
little brayd of envy toward the glory of the King, and thereby feeling him
easy to fall out if the matter were well handled, he craftily sought the
ways to prick him forward* taking always the occasion of his coming, and
also keeping himself close within his bands, that he rather seemed to follow
him then to lead him. For when the Duke began first to praise and boast the
King, and to show how much profit the Realm should take by his reign: Bishop
Morton answered, surely my Lord, folly it were for me to lie, for I am sure if
I would swear the contrary ye would not once believe me, but if the world
would have begun as I would have wished, that King Henry's son had had the
Crown, and not King Edward* then would I have been his true and faithful
subject, but after that God had ordained him to lose it, and King Edward to
reign, I was never so mad with a dead man to strive against the quick, so was
I ever to King Edward a faithful and true chaplin, and glad would have been
that his children should have succeeded him, howbeit if the secret judgment of
God have otherwise provided, I purpose not to spurn against the prick, nor
labor to set up that God pulls down. And as for the late protector, and now
King, and with that word he left, saving that he said that he had already
meddled too much with the world, and would from that day meddle with his book
and beads, and no further. Then longed the Duke sore to hear, what he would
have said, because he ended with the King, and there so suddenly stopped, and
exhorted him familiarly, between them both to be bold and to say whatsoever
he thought, whereof he faithfully promised there should never come hurt, and
peradventure more good then he would think: And that he himself intended to
use his faithful secret advice and counsel, which he said was the only
cause for the which he procured of the King to have him in his custody, where
he might reckon himself at home, or else he had been put in the hands of
them with whom he should not have found like favor. The Bishop right humbly
thanked him, and said, in good faith my Lord, I love not much to talk of
P^inces, as of a thing not all out of peril, although the word be without
fault, but yet it must be as it pleases the Prince to construe it. And ever I
think on Aesops talk, that when the Lion had proclaimed that on pain of death
there should no horned beasts come into the wood, one beast that had a bunch of
flesh growing out of his head, fled a great pace: the fox that saw him fly
with all the have, asked him whither he fled? In faith, quoth he, I neither
know nor care, so I were once hence, because of the proclamation made against
horned beasts. What fool, quoth the fox, the Lion never meant it by thee, for
that which thou have is no horn in thy head. No marry, quoth he, I know that
well enough, but if he say it is a horn, where am I then? The Duke laughed
merrily at the tale, and said, my Lord I warrant you, neither the Lion nor the
Bore shall pick any matter at any thing here spoken, for it shall never come
near their ears. In good faith sir, said the Bishop, if it did, the thing
that I was about to say taken as well, as before God I meant it, could deserve
but thanks, and yet taken as I think it would, might happen to turn me to
little good, and you to less.

Then longed the Duke much more to know what it was. Whereupon the Bishop said.
In good faith my Lord, as for the late Protector* since he is now King in
possession, I purpose not to dispute his title, but for the wealth of this
realm, whereof his grace has now the governance, and whereof I my self am a
poor member, I was about to wish that to those good abilities whereof he has
already right many, little needing my praise, yet might it have pleased God for
the better store to have given him some of such other excellent virtues meet
for the rule of the Realm, as our Lord has planted in the person of your
grace, and there left off again. The Duke somewhat marvelling at his sudden
pauses, as though they were but parentheses, with a high countenance said: my
Lord, I evidently perceive, and no less note your often breathing and sudden
stopping in your communication, so that to my intelligence your words neither
come to any direct or perfect sentence in conclusion, whereby either I might
perceive and have knowledge what your inward intent is now toward the King, or
what affection you bear toward me. For the comparison of good qualities
ascribed to us both (for the which I my self knowledge and recognize to have
none, nor look for no praise of any creature for the same) makes me not a
little to muse, thinking that you have some other privy Imagination, by love
or by grudge ingraved and imprinted in your heart, which for fear you dare
not, or for childish shamefastness you be ashamed to disclose and reveal and
especially to m^ being your friend, which on my honor do assure you to be as
secret in this case, as the deaf and dumb person is to the singer, or the
tree to the hunter. The Bishop being somewhat bolder, considering the Dukes
promise, but most of all animated and encouraged, because he knew the Duke
desirous to be exalted and magnified, and also he perceived the inward hatred
and privy rancor which he bare toward King Richard, was now bouldned to open
his stomach even to the very bottom, intending thereby to compass how to
destroy and utterly to confound King Richard, and to deprive him of his dignity
royal, or else to set the Duke so fair with the desire of ambition, that he
himself might be safe, and escape out of all danger and peril, which thing
he brought shortly to conclusion both to the Kings destruction and the Dukes
confusion and to his own safeguard, and finally, to his high promotion. And so
(as I said before) upon trust and confidence of the Dukes promise, the Bishop
said: my singular good Lord, since the time of my captivity, which being in your
graces custody, I may rather call it a liberal liberty more then a straight
imprisonment, in avoiding idleness, the mother and nourisher of all vices, in
reading books and ancient pamphlets, I have found this sentence written, that
no man is borne free and in liberty of himself only, for one part of duty he
owes or should owe to his parents for his procreation by a very natural
instinct and filial courtesy: another part* to his friends and kinsfolk* for
proximitie of blood, and natural amity does of very duty challenge and demand:
But it the native country in the which he tasted first the sweet air of this
pleasant flattering world after his nativitie, demands as a debt by a
natural bond neither to be forgotten, nor yet to be put in oblivion, which
saying causes me to consider in what case this Realm my native country now
stands, and in what estate and assuranc before this time it has continued:
what governor we now have, and what ruler we might have, for I plainly
perceive the Realm being in this case must needs decay and be brought to
utter confusion and final extermination: But one hope I have incorporate in my
breast, that is, when I consider and in my mind do diligently remember, and
daily behold your noble personage, your justice and indifference, your fervent
love toward your country and likewise theirs to you, the great learning,
pregnant wit and goodly eloquence, which so much does abound in the person of
your grace, I must needs think this Realm fortunate, yea twice more then
fortunate, which has such a Prince in store, meet and apt to be a governor,
in whose person being endued with so many qualities consists and rests the
very undoubted similitude and image of true honor. But on the other side when
I call to memory the good qualities of the late Protector and now called King,
so violated and subverted by tyranny, so changed and altered by usurped
authority, so clowded and shadowed by blind and insatiable ambition, yea and so
suddenly (in manner by a metamorphosis) transformed from politic civility, to
detestable tyranny; I must needs say, and justly affirm, that he is neither
meet to be a King of so noble a Realm, nor so famous a Realm meet to be
governed by such a tyrant: Was not his first enterprise to obtain the Crown
begun and incepted by the murder of diverse noble, valiant, true, and virtuous
personages? Oh a holy beginning to come to mischievous ending: did he not
secondarily proceed contrary to all laws of honesty, shamefully against his
own natural mother, being a woman of much honor, and more virtue, declaring
her openly to be a woman given to carnal affection, and dissolute living
(which thing if it had been true, as it was not indeed: every good and
natural child would have rather been silent, then have blased it abroad, and
especially she being alive.) Declaring furthermore his two brethren and his
two nephews to be bastards, and to be borne in adultery, yet not with all
this is he content. After that he had obtained the garland for the which he
so long thirsted, he caused the two poor innocents his nephews committed to
him for especial trust, to be murdered and shamefully to be killed. The
blood of which silly and little babes daily cries to God, from the earth for
vengeance: alas my heart sobbeth, to remember this bloody butcher and cruel
murderer, what surety shall be in this Realm to any person, either for life
or goods under such a cruel Prince, which regards not the destruction of his
own blood, and then less the loss of others. And most especially, as often
times it chances, where a covetuous or a cruel Prince takes suspicion, the
smalest swarving that is possible (if the thing be misconstured) may be the
cause of the destruction of many giltlesse persons: and especial of noble and
wealthy personages having great possessions and riches: Such a Lord is Lucifer
when he is entered into the heart of a proud Prince given to covetousness and
cruelty.

But now, my Lord, to conclude what I mean toward your noble person, I say
and affirm, if you love God, your lineage, or your native contrie, you must
your self take upon you the Crown and Diadem of this noble Empire, both for
the maintenance of the honor of the same (which so long has flourished in
fame and renown) as also for the deliverance of your natural country men,
from the bondage and thraldom (worse then the captivity of Egypt) of so
cruel a tyrant and arrogant oppressor. For thus I dare say, if any foreign
Prince or potentate, yea the Turk himself would take upon him the regiment
here and the Crown, the Commons would rather admit and obey him, then to live
under such a bloud-sucker and child-killer: but how much more joyful and glad
would they be to live under your grace, whom they all know to be a ruler
meet and convenient for them to live under despise not, nor forsake so
manifest occasion so lovingly offered. And if your self knowing the pain and
travail that appartaineth to the office of a king, or for any other
considerra^ion, will refuse to take upon you the (...) of this Realm (...)
adjure you by the faith that you owe to God, by your honor, and by your oath
made to Saint George patron of the noble order of the Garter (whereof you be a
companion) and by the love and affection that you bear to your native country
and the people of the same, to devise some way how this Realm now being in
misery, may by your high discretion and princely policy, be brought and
reduced to some surety and convenient regiment under some good governor by
you to be excogitate: for you are the very patron, the only help, refuge, and
comfort of the poor, amassed and desolate commons of this Realm. For if you
could either devise to set up again the lineage of Lancaster, or advance the
eldest daughter of King Edward to some high and puissant Prince, not only the
new crowned King shall small time enjoy the glory of his dignity, but also all
civil war should cease, all domestical discord should sleep, and peace,
profit and quietness should be set forth and embraced. When the Bisho^ had
thus ended his saying, the Duke sigh^d and spoke not of a great while which
sore abashed the Bishop, and made him change color: which thing when the Duke
perceived, he said, be not afraid my Lord, all promises shall be kept, to
morrow we will commune more: let us go to supper, so that night they communed
no more, not a little to the inquietation of the Bishop, which now was even as
desirous to know the Dukes mind and intent, as the Duke longed the day before
to know his opinion and meaning. So the nex day, the Duke sent for the Bishop
and rehearsed to him in manner, (for he was both witty and eloquent) all the
communication had between them before, and so paused a while, and after a
little season putting off his bonet he said: O Lord God creator of all things,
how much is this Realm of England and the people of the same bounden to thy
goodness, for where we now be in vexation and trouble, with great storms
oppressed, sailing and tossing in a desperate ship without good Master or
Governor: by thy help good Lord I trust ere long time past, that we shall
provide for such a ruler as shall be both to thy pleasure, and also to the
security and safeguard of this noble Realm. And then he put on his bonet,
saying to the Bishop, my Lord of Ely, whose true heart and sincere affection
toward me at all times I have evidently perceived and known, and now most of
all our last privy communication and secret devising, I must needs in heart
think and with mouth confess and say, that you be a sure friend, a trusty
counselor, a vigilant foreseer, a lover of your country, a anturall
countryman: for which kindness, for my part, I most lovingly render to you my
hearty thanks now with words: hereafter trusting to recompense and remunerate
you with deeds, if life and power shall serve. And since at our last
communication, you have disclosed, and opened the very secrets and privities of
your stomach, touching the Duke of Gloucester now usurper of the Crown, and
also have a little touched the advancement of the two noble families of York
and Lancaster: I shall likewise not only declare and manifest unto you, all my
open acts, attempts and doings, but also my privy intents, and secret
cogitations. To the intent that as you have unbuckled your heart of your privy
meanings and secret puposes to me: so shall all my cloudy working, close
devices, and secret imaginations, be (as clear as the sun) revealed,
opened, and made lightsome to you.

And to begin, I declare; that when King Edward was deceased, to whom I thought
my self little or nothing beholden, (although we two had married two sisters)
because, he neither promoted nor preferred me, as I thought I was worthy and
had deserved, neither favored nor regarded me, according to my degree and
birth: for surely I had by him little authority and less rule, and in effect
nothing at all: which caused me the less to favor his children, because I
found small humanity, or none in their parent. I then began to study, and with
mature deliberation, to ponder and consider, how and in what manner this Realm
should be ruled and governed. And first I remembered an old proverb worthy of
memory, that often ruineth the Realm, where children rule, and women govern.
This old Adage so sunk, and settled in my head, that I thought it a great
error, and extreme mischief to the whole Realm, either to suffer the young
King to rule, or the Queen his mother to be a governor over him, considering
that her brethren, and her first children (although they were not extract of
high and noble lineage) took more upon them, and more exalted themselves by
reason of the Queen, then did the Kings brethren, or any Duke in his Realm:
Which in conclusion turned to their confusion. Then I being persuaded with my
self in this point, thought it necessary both for the public and profitable
wealth of this Realm, and also for mine own commodity and emolument, to take
part with the Duke of Gloucester: Whom I asure you I thought to be as clean
without dissimulation, as tractable without injury, as merciful without
cruelty, as now I know him perfectly to be a dissembler without verity, a
tyrant without pity, yea and worse then the tyrant Phalaris, destitute of all
truth and clemency: And so by my means, at the first council holden at
London, when he was most suspected of that thing that after happened, (as you
my Lord know well enough) he was made Protector and defender, both of the
King and of the Realm, which authority once gotten, and the two children
partly by policy brought under his governance, he being moved with the
gnawing and covetous serpent, desired to reign, and never ceased privilie to
exhort and require (yea and sometimes with minatorie terms to persuade me and
other Lords as well spiritual as temporal, that he might take upon him the
Crown, till the Prince came to the age of four and twenty years, and were
able to govern the Realm, as a mature and sufficient King: Which thing when
he saw me somewhat stick at, both for the strangeness of the example
(because no such president had been seen) and also because we remembered that
men once ascended to the highest tipe of honor and authority will not gladly
descend again, he then brought in instruments, authentike Doctors, Proctors,
and notaries of the Law, with depositions of diverse witnesses, testifying King
Edwards children to be bastards, which depositions then I thought to be as
true, as now I know them to be fained, and ^estified by persons with rewards
untruely subordinate. When the said depositions were before us read and
diligently heard, he stood up bareheaded, saying; Well my Lords, even as I and
you sage and discreet councellers would that my Nephews should have no wrong:
So I pray you to do me nothing but right. For these witnesses and sayings of
famous Doctors being true, I am only the undoubted heir to Lord Richard
Plantagenet Duke of York; adjudged to be the very heir to the Crown of this
Realm by authority of Parliament, which things, so by learned men to us for a
verity declared, caused me and other to take him for our lawful and undoubted
Prince and sovereign Lord. For well we know that the Duke of Clarence Son, by
reason of the attainder of his Father, was disabled to inherit, and also the
Duke himself was named to be a bastard, as I my self have heard spoken, and
that upon great presumptions more times then once: so again by my aid and
favor, he of a Protector was made a King, and of a subject made a Governor,
at which time he promised me upon his fidelity, laying his hand in mine at
Baynards Castle that the two young Princes should live, and that he would so
provide for them, and so maintain them in honorable estate, that I and all the
Realm ought and should be content. But when he was once Crowned King, and in
full possession of the whole Realm, he cast away his old conditions as the
Adder does his skin, verifying the old proverb, honors change manners, as
the Parish Priest remembers not that he was ever Parish Clarke. For when I my
self sued to him for my part of the Earl of Hartfords lands, which his
brother King Edward wrongfully detyned and withheld from me, and also required
to have the office of the high Constable ship of England, as diverse of my noble
ancestors before this time have had, and in long descent continued:

In this my first suite, showing his good mind toward me, he did not only
first delay me, and afterward deny me, but gave me such unkind words, with ^uch
taunts and retaunts, yea in manner check and check mate to the uttermost
proof of my patience. As though I had never furthered him but hindered him, as
though I had put him down, and not set him up* yet al these ingratitudes and
undeserved unkindnesses I bare closely and suffer patiently and covertly
remembered, outwardly dissembling that I inwardly thought, and so with a painted
countenance I passed the last summer in his last company, not without many
fair promises, but without any good deeds. But when I was credibly informed
of the death of the two young innocents, his own natural Nephews, contrary
to his faith and promise, to the which God be my judge I never agreed nor
condiscended, O Lord, how my veins panted, how my body trembled, and my heart
inwardly grudged, in so much that I so abhorred the sight, and much more the
company of him, that I could no longer abide in his court, except I should be
openly revenged. The end whereof was doubtful, and so I fained a cause to
depart, and with a merry countenance and a dispightful heart I took my leave
humbly of him (he thinking nothing less then that I was displeased) and so
returned to Brecknocke to you.

But in the journey as I returned, whether it were by the inspiration of the
holy Ghost, or* by Melancolous disposition, I had diverse and sundry
imaginations how to deprive this unnatural Uncle, and bloody butcher, from his
royal seat, and princely dignity. First I fantasied, that if I list to take
upon me the Crown, and imperial Scepter of the Realm, now was the time fit
and convenient. For now was the way made plain, and the gate opened, and
occasion given, which now neglected, should peradventure never take such effect
and conclusion. For I saw he was disdained of the Lords temporal, execrate
and accursed of the Lords spiritual, detested of all gentlemen, and despised of
all the commonaltie: So that I saw my chance as perfectly, as I saw my own
Image in a glass, that there was no person (if I had been greedy to attempt
the enterprise) could nor should have won the ring, or got the gole before me.
And on this point I rested in imagination secretly with my self, two days at
Teukesbury. And from thence sojourning I mused and thought it was not best nor
convenient to take upon me as a conqueror, for then I knew that all men, and
especially the nobility, would with all their power withstand me, both for
rescuing of possessions and tenours, as also for subverting of the whole
estate, Laws, and Customs of the Realm: Such a power has a conqueror, as
you know well enough my Lord. But at the last, in all this doubtful case there
sprang a new branch out of my head, which surely I thought should have brought
forth fair flowers, but the sun was so hot that they turned to dry weeds;
for I suddenly remembered that Lord Edmond Duke of Somerset my Grandfather was
with King Henry the sixth in the second and third degrees from John Duke of
Lancaster lawfully begotten: So that I thought sure my mother being eldest
daughter to Duke Edmond, that I was next to King Henry the sixth of the house of
Lancast^r. This title pleased well such as I made privy of my counsel, but
much more it encouraged my foolish desire, and elevated my ambitious intent, in
so much that I clearly judged, and in mine own mind was determinately
resolved, that I was indubitated heir of the house of Lancaster, and thereupon
concluded, to make my first foundation, and erect my new building. But whether
God so ordered, or by fortune it so chanced, while I was in a mase, either to
conclude suddenly on this title, and to set it open amongst the common people,
or to keep it secret a while, see the chance: as I rode between Worcester and
Bridgnorth, I encountered with the lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, now
wife to the Lord Stanley, which is the very daughter and sole heir to John
Duke of Somerset, my grandfathers elder brother: Which was as clean out of my
mind as though I had never never seen her, so that she and her son the
Earl of Richmond be both bulwark and portcolice between, and the gate, to
enter into the majesty royal and getting of the Crown. And when we had
communed a little concerning her son, as I shall show you after, and were
departed, she to our Lady of Worcester, and I toward Shrewsbury: I then new
changed and in manner amassed, began to dispute with my self, little considering
that thus my earnest was turned even to a tittle not woth esteem. Presently I
imagined whether I were best to take upon me, by the election of the nobility
and commonaltie, which me thought easy to be done, the usurper King thus being
in hatred and abhorred of this whole Realm, or to take it by power, which
stands in fortunes chance, and difficile to be achieved and brought to
pass. Thus rumbling and tossing, in the waves of ambiguitie, between the
stone and sacrifice, I considered first the office, duty, and pain of a King,
which surely think that no mortal man can justly, and truly observe, except
he be called, elected, and specially appointed by God, as King David and
diverse others have been.

But further I remembered that if I once took on me the Scepter, and the
governance of the Realm: That of two extreme enemies I was daily sure, but of
one trusty friend (which now adays be gone a pilgrimage) I was neither
assured nor credibly ascertained (such is the worlds mutation) for I manifestly
perceived that the daughters of King Edward, and their alies, and friends,
which be no small number, being both, for his sake much beloved, and also for
the great injury and manifest tyranni done to them, by the new usurper, much
lamented, and pitied, would never cease to bark if they cannot bite at the
one side of me. Likewise my cousin the Earl of Richmond, his aides and
kinsfolk, which be not of little power, will surely attempt like a fierce
grayhound, either to bite or to pierce me on the other side. So that my life
and rule should ever hang by a hair, never in quiet, but ever in doubt of
death or deposition. And if the said two linages of York and Lancaster, which
so long have strived for the imperial Diadem, should join in one against me,
then were I surely mated and the game gotten. Wherefore I have clearly
determined, and with my self concluded, utterly to relinquish all such
fantastical imaginations concerning the obtaining of the Crown. But all such
plagues, calamities and troubles (which I feared and suspected) might have
chanced on me if I had taken the rule and regiment of this reale, I shall with
a reredemaine so make them rebound to our common enemy that calls himself
King, that the best stopper that he has at tenice shall not well stop without
a fault: for as I told you before, the Countess of Richmond in my return from
the new named King, meeting me in the high way, prayed me first for kindred
sake, secondly for the love I bare to my grandfather Duke Humphrey, which was
sworn brother to her father, to move the King to be good to her son Henry
Earl of Richmond, and to license him with his favor to return again into
England: and if it were his pleasure so to do, she promised that the Earl
her son should marry one of King Edwards daughters at the appointment of the
King without any thing to be taken or demanded for the said espousals, but
only the Kings favor, which request I soon overpassed, and gave her fair
words and so departed. But after in my lodging, when I called to memory with a
deliberate study, and did circumspctly ponder them, I fully adjudged that the
holy Ghost caused her to move a thing (the end whereof she could not consider)
both for the security of the Realm as also for the preferment of her child,
and the destruction and final confusion of the common enemy King Richard.
Which thing she neither then thought, I am sure, as I by her words could make
conjecture, nor I my self cast not her desire to be so profitable to the
Realm as I now do perceive, but such a Lord is God* that with a little
sparkle he kindles a great fire, and so finally to declare to you the very
conclusion to the which I am both bent and set, my mind is, and my power and
purpose shall help, that the Earl of Richmond very heir of the house of
Lancaster (in the quarrel of the which lineage, both my father and grandfather
lost their lives in battle) shall take to wife Lady Elizabeth, eldest daughter
to K. Edward; by the which marriage both the houses of York and Lancaster may
be obtained and united in one, to the clear stablishment of the title to the
Crown of this noble Realm. To the which conclusion if the mothers of both
parties, and especially the Earl himself, and the Lady will agree, I doubt
not but the braging Bore, which with his tuskes raseth every man's skin, shall
not only be brought to confusion as he has deserved, but that this Empire shall
ever be certain of an undubitate heir, and then shall all civil and intestine
war cease, which has so long continued, to the parting of many men's Crowns,
and this Realm shall be reduced again to quietness, renoune, and glory.
This invention of the Duke many men thought after, that it was more imagined
for the inward hatred that he bear to King Richard, then for any favor that
he bare to the Earl of Richmond. But of such doubtful matters, it is not
best to judge for erring to far from the mind and intent of the actour: But
whatsoever he intended, this device once opened to King Richard was the very
occasion, that he was rounded shorter by the whole head, without attainder or
judgment.

When the Duke had said, the Bishop, which ever favored the house of Lancaster,
was wondrous joyful, and much rejoiced to hear this device, for now came the
wind about even as he would have it; for all his imagination tended to this
effect, to have King Richard subdued, and to have the lines of K. Edward* and
King Henry the sixth again raised and advanced. But Lord how he rejoiced to
think how that by this marriage the linages of York and Lancaster should be
conjoined in one, to the very stead fastness of the public wealth of this
Realm.

And lest the Dukes courage should swage, or his mind should again alter, as
it did often before, as you may easily perceive by his own tale; He thought
to set up all the sails he had, to the intent that the ship of his pretended
purpose might come shortly to some sure port: And said to the Duke, my Lord;
since by Gods high provision and your incomparable wisdom and policy, this
noble conjunction was first moved, now it is convenient, yea and necessary to
consider, what personages and friends we shall first make privy of this high
device and politic conclusion. By my truth quoth the Duke we will begin with
my Lady of Richmond the Earls mother which knows where he is, either in
captivity or at large in Brytaine. For I heard say that the Duke of Britain
restored him to liberty immediately after the death of King Edward, by whose
means he was restrained. Since you will begin that way (said the Bishop) I
have an old friend with the Countess, a man sober, secret, and well witted,
called Reignold Bray, whose prudent policy I have known to have compassed
things of great importance* for whom I shall secretly send if it be your
pleasure, and I doubt not he will gladly come, and with a good will. So with a
little diligence, the Bishop wrote a letter to Reighnold Bray, requiting him to
come to Brecknock with speed, for great and urgent causes touching his
Mistress: and no other thing was declared in the letter. So the messenger rode
into Lancashire where Bray was with the Countess and Lord Thomas Stanley her
husband, and delivered the letter, which when he had read, he took it as a
sign or presage of some good fortune to come, and so with the messenger he
came to the Castle of Brecknocke, where the Duke and the Bishop declared what
thing was devised both to set the Realm in a quiet steadfastnesse, and also
for the high preferment of the Earl of Richmonds son to his Lady and
Mistrisse: Willing her first to compass how to obtain the good will of Queen
Elizabeth, and also of her eldest daughter bearing the same name: and after
secretly to send to her son into Britain to declare what high honor was
prepared for him if he would swear to marry the Lady Elizabeth as soon as he
was King and in Royal possession of the Realm. Reighnold Bray with a glad
heart forgetting nothing hiven to him in charge, in gread have and with good
speed returned to the Countess his Lady and Mistress.

When Bray was departed and this great doleful vessel once set a broach, the
Bishop thrusting for nothing more then for liberty, when he saw the Duke
pleasant and well minded toward him told, the Duke that if he were in his Isle
of Ely he could make many friends to further their enterprise, and if he were
there and had but four days warning, he little regarded the malice of King
Richard, his country was so strong. The Duke knew well all this to be true,
but yet loath he was that the Bishop should depart, for he knew well that as
long as the Bishop was with him, he was sure of politic advice, sage
council, and circumspect proceeding. And so he gave the Bishop fair words,
saying that he should shortly depart, and that well accompanied for fear of
enemies. The Bishop being as witty as the Duke was wily, did not tarry till
the Dukes company were assembled, but secretly disguised in a night departed
(to the Dukes great displeasure) and came to his see of Ely, where he found
money and friends, and so sailed into Flanders, where he did the Earl of
Richmond good service, and never returned again till the Earl of Richmond
after being King sent for him, and shortly promoted him to the Sea of
Canterbury. Thus the Bishop wound himself from the Duke when he had most need
of his aid, for if he had tarried still the Duke had not made so many blabbes
of his council, nor put so much confidence in the Welshmen, nor yet so
temerariously set forward without knowledge of his friends as he did, which
things were his sudden overthrow as they that knew it did report.

When Reighnald Bray had declared his message, and privy instruction to the
Countess of Richmond his Mistrisse, no marvel though she were joyous and
glad, both of the good news and also for the obtaining of such a high friend
in his sons cause as the Duke was, wherefore she willing not to slip this
matter, but to farther it to the uttermost of her power and ability, devised a
means how to break this matter to Queen Elizabeth then being in sanctuary at
Westminster. And thereupon she having in her family at that time for the
preservation of her health, a certain Welshman called Jews, learned in
Physic, which for his gravitie and experience was well known and much
esteemed amongst great estates of the Realm: with whom she used sometimes
liberally and familiarly to talk; now having opportunity and occasion to break
her mind unto him of this weighty matter, declared that the time was come that
her son should be joined in marriage with Lady Elizabeth, daughter and heir
to King Edward, and that King Richard being taken and reputed of all men for
the common enemy of the Realm, should out of all honor and estate be
dejected, and of his rule and kingdom be clearly spoiled and expulsed: and
required him to go to Queen Elizabeth (with whom in his faculty he was of
counsel) not as a messenger, but as one that came friendly to visit and
consolate her, and as time and place should require to make her privy of this
device, not as a thing concluded, but as a purpose by him imagined. This
Physician did not long linger to accomplish her desire, but with good diligence
repaired to the Queen, being still in the sanctuary at Westminster. And when
he saw time proper and convenient for his purpose, he said unto her: Madam,
although my imagination be very simple, and my device more foolish, yet for
the entire affection that I bear toward you and your children, I am so bold
to utter unto you a secret and privy conceit that I have cast and compassed in
my fantastical brain. When I well remember, and no less consider the great
loss and damage that you have sustained by the death of your noble and loving
husband, and the great dolor and sorrow that you have suffered and tolerated
by the cruel murder of your innocent children: I can no less do both of
bounden duty and christian charity, then daily study, and hourly imagine not
only how to bring your heart to comfort and gladness, but also devise how to
revenge the righteous quarrel of you and your children on that bloody
blood-sucker and cruel tyrant King Richard.

And first consider, what battle, what manslaughter, what mischief has risen
in this Realm by the dissension between the two noble houses of York and
Lancaster, which two families (as I have contrived) if they may be joined in
one, I think, yea and doubt not but your line shall be again restored to the
pristinate estate and degree to your great joy and comfort, and to the utter
confusion of your mortal enemy the usurper King. You know very well madam, that
of house the of Lancaster, the Earl of Richmond is nxet of blood, which is
living and a lusty young bachelor, and to the house of York your daughters now
are heirs: if you could agree and invent the means how to couple your eldest
daughter with the young Earl of Richmond in matrimony, no doubt but the
usurper of the Realm should be shortly deposed, and your heir again to her
right restored.

When the Queen had heard this friendly motion (which was as far from her
thought as the man that the rude people say is in the Moon) Lord how her
spirits revived, and how her heart leapt in her body for joy and gladness. And
first giving laud to almighty God as the chief author of her comfort,
secondly to Master Jews the deviser of the good news and tidings, instantly
besought him, that as he had been the first inventer of so good an
enterprise, that now he would not relinquish nor desist to follow the same:
desiring him further (because he was appertaining to the Countess of Richmond
mother to the Earl Henry) that he would with all diligence resort to her then
lodging in her husbands place within the city of London, and to declare on the
Queens behalf to the Countess, that all the friends and favorers of King
Edward her husband, should assist and take part with the Earl of Richmond her
son, so that he would take a corporal oath after the Kingdom obtained, to
espouse and take to wife the Lady Elizabeth her daughter, or else Lady Cecile,
if the eldest daughter were not then living.

Master Jews with all dexterity so sped his business, that he made and
concluded a final end and determination of this enterprise between the two
mothers, and because he was a Physician, and out of all suspicion and
misdeeming, he was the common currer and daily messenger between them, ayding
and setting forth the invented conspiracy against King Richard. So the Lady
Margaret Countess of Richmond brought into a good hope of the preferment o^
her son, made Reyghnold Bray her most faithful servant chief soliciter and
privy procurer of this conspiracy, giving him in charge, secretly to invegle
and attract such persons of nobility to join with her, and to take her part as
he knew to be ingenious, faithful, diligent, and of activity. This Reighnold
Bray within few days brought unto his lure (first of all taking of every
person a solemn oath to be true and secret) sir Gyles Daubeney, sir John
Cheiney knight, Richard Guylford, and Thomas Rain Esquiors, and diverse others.
The Countess of Richmond was not so diligent for her part, but Queen
Elizabeth was as vigilant on the other side, and made friends, and appointed
Councellers to set forward and advance her business. In the mean season the
Countess of Richmond took into her service Christopher Vrswicke, an honest
and a wise Priest, and after an oath of him for to be secretly taken and
sworn, she uttered to him all her mind and council, adhibiting to him the
more confidence and truth that he all his life had favored and taken part with
King Henry the sixth, and as a special jewel put to her service by sir Jews
her Physician. So the mother studious for the prosperity of her son
appointed this Christopher Vrsewicke to sail into Britain to the Earl of
Richmond, and to declare and to demonster to him all pacts and agreements
between her and the Queen agreed and concluded: But sudenly she remembering
that the Duke of Buckingham was one of the first inventers, and a secret
founder of this enterprise, determined to send some personage of more
estimation then her chaplain, and so elected Hugh Conway esquire, and sent him
into with a great some of money to her son, giving him charge to declare to
Earl the great love especial favor that the most part of the nobility of
the Realm bare toward him, the benevole^t minds which the whole commonaltie
frankly offered and liberally exhibited to him, willing and advising him not to
neglect so good an occasion apparently offered, but with all speed and
diligence to addict and settle his mind and full intention how to return home
again into England, where he was both wished and looked for, giving him
farther monition and counsel to take land and arrival in the principality of
Wales, where he should not doubt to find both aid, comfort and friends.
Richard Guylford, lest Hugh Conwey might fortune to be taken or stopped at
Plimmouth, where he intended to take his navigation, sent out of Kent Thomas
Rame with the same instruction: and both made such diligence and had such wind
and weather, the one by land from Calice, and the other by water from
Plimmouth, that within less then an hour both arrived in the Duke of
Britains court, and spoke with the Earl of Richmond, which. from the death of
K. Edward went at his pleasure and liberty, and to him counted and manifested
the cause and effect of their message and Embassage. When the Earl had
received this joyful message, which was the more pleasant because it was
unlooked for, he rendered to Jesu his savior his most humble and hearty
thanks, being in firm credence and belief that things as he with busy
mind and laborious intent had wished and desired, could never have taken any
effect without the help and preferment of Almighty God. And now being put in
comfort of his long longing, he did communicate and break to the Duke of
Britain all his secrets and privy messages which were to him declared,
advertizing him that he was entered into a sure and steadfast hope to obtain
and get the Crown and Kingdom of the Realm of England, desiring him both of
his good will and friendly help toward the achiving of his offered enterprise,
promising him when he came to his intended purpose, to render to him again
equal kindnesses and condign gratulations.

Although the Duke before that day by Thomas Hutton Ambassador from King
Richard had both by money and prayers been solicited and moved to put again
into safe custody the Earl of Richmond, he nevertheless promised faithfully
to aid him, and his promises he truly performed.

The third year.
Whereupon the Earl with all diligence sent into England again Hugh Conwey and
Thomas Rame, which should declare his coming shortly into England, to the
intent that all the things which by counsel might be for his purpose
provided, should be accelerate and hasted, and that all things doubtful should
of his friends be prudently foreseen, in avoiding all engines and snares which
King Richard had or might have set in disturbance of his purpose, and he in
the mean season would make his abode still in Britain, till things necessary
for his journey were prepared and brought in a readiness.

In the mean season the Chiefetaynes of the conjuration in England began
together many enterprises: Some in convenient fortresses put strong garrisons:
Some kept armed men privily, to the intent when they should have knowledge of
the Earls landing, they would begin to stir up the war: Others did
secretly move and solicit the people to rise and make an insurrection: Others
(amongst whom John Morton Bishop of Ely then being in Flanders was chief) by
privy letters, and cloked mess^ngers, did stir and invite to this new
conjunction* all such which they certainly knew to have a rooted hatred, or to
bear a cankered malice toward King Richard and his proceedings

Although this great enterprise were never so privily handled, and so secretly
amongst so circumspect persons treated, compassed and conveyed, yet knowledge
thereof came to the ears of K. Richard, which with the sudden chance was not
a little moved and astonished. First, because he had no host ready prepared and
conscribed. Secondarily, he knew not where to occur and meet his enemies,
or whither to go or where to tarry. Wherefore he determined to dissemble the
matter, as though he knew nothing, till he had assembled his host, and in the
mean season either by the rumor of the common people, or by the diligence of
his exploratours and espialles to investigate and ^earch out all the Counsels,
determinations, intents and compasses of his close adversaries, or else by
crafty policy to intercept and take some person of the same conjuration,
considering that there is no more secret nor hid especial than that which
lurketh in diss^mulation of knowledge and intelligence, or is hidden in the
name and shadow of counterfeit humanity and fained kindness. And because he
knew the Duke of Buckingham to be the chief head and aid of the conjuration,
he thought it most necessary to pluck him from that part either by fair
promises or open war. Whereupon he addressed his loving letters to the Duke,
as full of mellifluous words, humanity and familiarity as the interior
cogitation and privy meaning was full of malice, rancor, and poison: giving
farther in charge to the messenger that carried the letter to promise to the
Duke on his behalf golden hills and silver rivers, and with all gentle and
pleasant means to persuade and exhort the Duke to come to the Court. But the
Duke as wily as the King, mistrusting the fair flattering words, and the gay
promises to him so suddenly without any cause offered, knowing the crafty
castes of K. Richards bow, which in diverse affairs before times he had seen
practiced, required the King to pardon him, excusing himself that he was so
diseased in his stomach, that he could scarce take any refection or rest.
King Richard not being content with this excuse, would in no wise admit the
same, but incontinent directed to the Duke other letters of a more rougher and
hautie sort, not without minatorie terms and checking words, commanding him,
all excuses set apart, to repair without any delay to his royal presence. The
Duke made to the messenger a determinate answer that he would not come to his
mortal enemy, whom he neither loved nor favored: and immediately prepared
open war against him, and persuaded all his accomplices and partakers, that
every man should in his quarter with all diligence raise up the people and make
a commotion. And by this means almost in one moment Thomas Marquis Dorcet came
out of Sanctuary, where he since the beginning of Richards days had
continued, whose life by the only help of sir Thomas Lovel Esquier, was
preserved from all danger and peril in this troublous world, and gathered
together a great band of men in Yorkshire. Sir Edward Courtney and Peter his
brother Bishop of Exeter, raised another army in Devonshire and Cornwall.

In Kent, Richard Gilford, and other Gentlemen, collected a great company of
Soldiers, and openly began War. But King Richard which in the mean time had
gotten together a great strength and puissaunce, thinking it not most for his
part beneficial, to disperse and divide his Army into small branches, and
particularly to persecute any one of the conjuration by himself; determined,
all other being set aside, with his whole puissaunce to set on the chief head,
which was the Duke of Buckingham. And so removing from London, he took his
journey toward Salsbury* to the intent that in his journey, he might set on
the Dukes army, if he might know him in any place encamped, or in order of
Battle arrayed. The King was scarce two days journey from Salisbury when the
Duke of Buckingham accompanied with a great power of wild Welshmen, whom he,
being a man of that courage and sharp speech, in manner against their wills
had rather thereto enforced and compelled by Lordly and strait commandment
then by liberal wages and gentle reteynour, which thing was the very occasion
why they left him desolate and cowardly forsook him. The Duke with all his
power marched through the forest of Dean^, intending to have passed the river
Severne at Gloucester, and there to have joined in army with the Courtneys and
other Western men of his confederacy and affinity, which if he had done, no
doubt but K. Richard, had been in great jeopardy either of privation of his
Realm or loss of his life or both. But see the chance, before he could
attain to Severne side, by force of continual rain and moisture, the river
rose so high, that it overflowed all the country adjoining, insomuch that men
were drowned in their beds, houses with the extreme violence were overturned,
children were carried about the fields, swimming in cradles, beasts were
drowned on hills, which rage of water lasted continually ten days, insomuch
that in the country adjoining they call it to this day, the great water, or
the Duke of Buckinghams great water. By this inundation the passages were so
closed, that the Duke could not come over Severne to his accomplices, nor they to
him, during the which time, the Welshmen lingering idely without money,
victuals, or wages, suddenly scaled and departed: and for all the Dukes fair
promises, menaces, and enforcements, they would in no wise either go further
or abide. The Duke thus abandoned and left almost alone, was of necessity
compelled to fly, and in his flight was with this sudden misfortune
marvelously disdained: and being unprovided, what counsel he should take and
what way he should follow, like a man in despair not knowing what to do, of
very trust and confidence conveyed himself into the house of Humfrey Banister
his servant, besides Shrewesbury, whom he had tenderly brought up, and whom he
above all men loved, favored and trusted, now not doubting but that in his
extreme necessity, he should find him faithful, secret and trusty, intending
there covertly to lurk, till either he might raise again a new army, or else
shortly to sail into Britain to the Earl of Richmond.

But when it was known to his adherents which were ready to give battle,
that his host was scaled and had left him almost alone, and was fled and could
not be found, they were suddenly amassed and stricken with a sudden fear,
that every man like persons desperate shifted for himself and fled, some went
to Sanctuary and to solitary places, some fled by sea, whereof the most part
within a few days after arrived safely in the Duchy of Britany. Among which
number were these persons, Peter Courtney Bishop of Exeter, and Sir Edmond
Courtney his brother, by King Henry the sev^nth, after created Earl of
D^^onshire, Thomas Marqu^s Dorcet, John Lord Wells, Sir John Burchier, Sir
Edmond Woodvile a valiant man in Arms, brother to Queen Elizabeth, Sir Rrbert
Willoughby, Sir Gyles Dabeney, Sir Thomas Arundell, Sir John Cheney and his two
brethren, Sir William Barkeley, Sir William Brandon, and Thomas his brother,
Sir Richard Edgcombe, all these for the most part being Knights, and John
Halwell, Edward Powninges a politic captain. At this very season John Morton
Bishop of Ely, and Christopher Vrswicke Priest, and another company of noble
men sojourned in Flanders, and by letters and messengers procured many enemies
against King Richard; Which using a vigilant eye, and a quick remembrance,
being newly come to Salisbury, having perfect notice and knowledge how the Duke
was fled, his accomplices intended to pass out of the Realm* First he sent men
of war to all the next ports and passages to keep straightly the sea coast,
so that no person should pass outward nor take land in the Realm, without
their assent and knowledge* Secondly, he made Proclamation, that what person
could show and reveal where the Duke of Buckingham was, should be highly
rewarded, if he were a bondsman he should be infranchised and set at liberty,
if he were of free blood, he should have a general pardon and be remunerate
with a thousand pounds. Furthermore, because he understood by Thomas Hutton,
which as you have heard was newly returned out of Britain, that Francis Duke
of Britain not only refused to keep the Earl of Richmond as a prisoner at
his contemplation and for his sake, but also was ready to aid and succor the
said Earl with men, money, and all things necessary for his transporting into
England. Wherefore he rigged and sent out ships of war well furnished and
decked with men and artillery, to scour and keep that part of the sea that
lies against Britain, to the intent that if the Earl of Richmond would
adventure to sail toward Englnad, either he should be taken captive or be
pro^^igate and driven from the coast of England. And moreover, to the intent
that every cost, way, passage, and corner should be diligently watched and
kept, he set at every dubious and suspected place, men of war, to seek,
search, and enquire if any creature could tell tidings of the Duke of Buckinham
or of any of his confederation, adherents, fautours or partakers.

While this busy search was diligently applied and put in execution, Humphrey
Banister (were it more for fear of loss of life and goods, or attracted and
provoked by the avaricious desire of the thousand pounds) he bewrayed his guest
and master to John Mitton then Sheriff of Shropshire, which suddenly with a
strong power of men in arms apprehended the Duke in a little grove adjoining
to the mansion of Humphrey Banister, and in great haste and evil speed
conveyed him apparelled in a pilled black cloak to the city of Salisbury
where King Richard then kept his household.

Whether this Banister bewrayed the Duke more for fear then covetousnes many
men do doubt: but sure it is, that shortly after he had betrayed the Duke his
Master, his son and heir waxed mad and so died in a Bores stie, his eldest
daughter of excellent beauty was suddely stricken with a foul leprosy, his
second son very marvelously deformed of his limbs and made decrepid, his
younger son in a small puddle was strangled and drowned, and he himself
being of extreme age arraigned and found guilty of a murder, and by his
Clergy saved. And as for his thousand pound, King Richard gave him not one
farthing; saying, that he which would be untrue to so good a master, would
be false to all other: howbeit, some say that he had a small office or a ferme
to stop his mouth withal. The Duke being by certain of the Kings council
diligently upon interrogatories examined what things he knew prejudicial to
the Kings person, opened and declared frankely and freely all the conjuration
without dissembling or glosing, trusting because he had truly and plainly
revealed and confessed all things that were of him required, that he should
have license to speak to the King which (whether it were to sue for pardon and
grace, or whether he being brought to his presence, would have sticked him
with a dagger, as men then judged) he sore desired and required. But when he
had confessed the whole fact and conspiracy upon Alsoules day without
arrignement or judgment, he was at Salisbury in the open marketplace on a new
skaffold beheaded and put to death. This death (as a reward) the Duke of
Buckingham received at the hands of King Richard, whom he before in his
affairs, purposes and enterprises had holden, sustained and set forward above
all Gods forbode.

By this all men may easily perceive that he not only loses both his labor,
travel and industry, and further stayneth and spotteth his line with a
perpetual ignominy and reproach, which in evil and mischief assisteth and
aideth an evil disposed person, considering for the most part, that he for
his friendly favor should receive some great displeasure or unfortunate
chance. Beside that God of his justice in conclusion appoints to him a
condign pain and afflction for his merits and deserts. While these things were
thus handled and ordered in England, Henry Earl of Richmond prepared an army
of five thousand manly Brittons, and forty well furnished ships. When all
things were prepared in a readiness, and the day of departing and setting
forward was appointed, which was the twelfth day of the month of October, in
the year of the incarnation of our Redeemer, one thousand four hundred forty
eight, and in the second year of King Richards reign, the whole army went on
shipbord and hoysed up their sails, and with a prosperous wind took the sea:
but toward night the wind changed, and the weather turned, and so high and
terrible a tempest suddenly arose, that with the very power and strength of the
storm, the ships were dispersed, severed and separated a sunder: some by force
were driven into Normandy, some were compelled to return again into Britain.
The ship wherein the Earl of Richmond was, associate only with one other
bark was all night tossed and turmoyled. In the morning after, when the rage
of the furious tempest was assuaged, and the ire of the blustering was
something appeased, about the hour of noone the same day, the Earl approached
to the south part of the Realm of England, even at the mouth of the Haven of
Pole in the county of Dorset, where he might plainly perceive all the Sea
banks and shores garnished and furnished with men of war and soldiers
appointed and deputed there to defend his arrival and landing as before is
mentioned. Wherefore he gave straight charge and sore commandment, that no
person should once presume to take land and go to the shore, until such time
as the whole navy were assembled and congregate. And while he expected and
lingered tarring for that purpose, he sent out a shippe-boate toward the land
side to know, whether they that stood there in such a number and so well
furnished in apparel defensive were his capital foes and enemies, or else
his friends, fosterers, and comforters. They that were sent in exploration and
message were instantly desired of the men of war keeping these coasts (which
thereof were before instructed and admonished) to descend and take land,
affirming that they were appointed by the Duke of Buckingham there to wait and
tarry for the arrival and landing of the Earl of Richmond, and to conduct
safely to the camp where the Duke not far off lay encamped with a populous
army and an host of great strength and vigor, to the intent that the Duke
and the Earl joining in puissaunces and forces together might prosecute and
chase King Richard being destitute of men, and in manner desperate and
fugitive, and so by that means and their own labors and industry to obtain
the end of their enterprise which they had before begun.

The Earl of Richmond suspecting their flattering request to be but a fraud
(as it was indeed) after that he perceived none of his ships to appear in his
sight, he weighed up his ancors and hoysed up his sails, having a prosperous
and strenable wind and a fresh gale sent even by God to deliver him from that
peril and jeopardie, arrived safe and in security in the Duchy of Normandy,
where he to (...) and solace his soldiers and peope, took his recreation by
the space of thredaies, and clearly determined with part of his company to
pass all by land again into Britain. And in the mean season he sent
Orators to the French King called Charles the eight, which newly succeeded his
father King Lewis the eleventh, not long before departed to God, requiring of
him a safe conduct and license to pass through his country of Normandy into
Britain. The young King having compassion of the misfortune and unfortunate
chance of the Earl of Richmond, not only gently granted and assigned to him a
pasporte, but also literally disbursed and departed to him a convenient some of
money for his conduct and expenses necessary in his long journey and passage.
But the Earl trusting on the French Kings humanity adventured to send his
ships home into Britain, and to set forward himself by land on his journie,
making no great haste till his messengers were returned, which being with the
benefit so comforted, and with hope of prosperous success so encouraged,
marched toward Britain with all diligent celeritie, intending there to
consult further with his lovers and friends of his affairs and enterprises.

When he was returned again into Britain he was certified by credible
information that the Duke of Buckingham had lost his head, and that the Marquis
Dorset, and a great number of noble men of England had a little before enquired
and searched for him there, and were now returned to Vanues.

When he had heard these news thus reported, he first sorrowed, and
dolorously lamented the first attempt and setting forward of his friends, and
especially of the Nobility not to have more fortunately succeeded. Secondly,
he rejoiced on the other part, that God had sent him so many valiant and
prudent Captains to be his companions in his martial enterprises, trusting
surely, and nothing doubting in his own opinion, but that all his business
should be wisely compassed and brought to a good conclusion. Wherefore he
determining with all diligence to accelerate and set forward his new begun
business, departed to Renes, and sent certain of his privy servitours to
conduct and bring the Marquis and the other Noble men to his presence. When
they knew that he was safely returned into Britain, Lord how they rejoiced
and applauded, for before that time they missed him, and knew not in what part
of the world to make investigation or search for him.

For they doubted and no less feared lest he had taken land in England, and
fallen into the hands of King Richard, in whose person they knew well was
neither mercy nor compassion. Wherefore in all speedy manner they galloped
toward him, and him reverently saluted, which meeting after great joy and
solace, and no small thanks and gratifications given and rendered on both
parts, they consulted and advisedly debated and commoned of their great
business and weighty enterprise, in the which season the solene feast of the
Nativitie of our Savior Christ happened, on which day all the English Lords
went with great solemnity to the chief Church of the City, and there each
gave faith and promise to other. The Earl himself first took a corporal
oath, and on his honor promising that incontinent after he should be possessed
of the Crown and dignity of the Realm of England, he would be conjoined in
matrimony with the Lady Elizabeth daughter to King Edward the fourth. Then all
the company swear to him fealty, and did to him homage as though he had been
that time the Crowned King and anointed Prince, promising faithfully and
fi^mely assuring that they would not only lose their worldly substance, but
also be deprived of their lives and worldly felicity, rather then to suffer
King Richard, that tyrant, longer to rule and ^aigne over them.

Which solemn oaths made and taken, the Earl of Richmond declared and
communicated all these doings to Francis Duke of Britain, desiring and most
heartily requiring him to aid him with a great army to conduct him into his
Country, which so sore longed and looked for his return, and to the which he
was by the more part of the Nobility called and desired, which (with Gods aid
and the Dukes comfort) he doubted not in short time to obtain, requiring him
further to lend to him a convenient some of money, affirming that all such
somes of money which he had received of his especial friends, were spent and
exhausted in the preparation of the last journey made toward England, which
somes of money after his enterprise once atchived, he in the word of a Prince
faithfully promised to repay and restore again. The Duke promised him aid and
help, upon confidence whereof he rigged his ships, and set forth his Navy well
decked with ordinance, and warlikely furnished with all things necessary, to
the intent to sail forward shortly, and to see no convenient time slackly
overpassed, nor be pretermitted.

In the mean season, King Richard apprehended in diverse parts of the Realm,
certain gentlemen of the Earl of Richmonds faction and confederation, which
either intended to sail into Britain toward him, or else at his landing to
assist and aid him. Amongst whom, sir George Brown, sir Roger Clifford and
four others were put to execution at London, and sir Thomas Sentliger which
had married the Duchess of Exeter the Kings own sister, and Thomas Rame and
diverse others were executed at Exeter. Besides these persons, diverse of his
household servants whom either he suspected or doubted, were by great cruelty
put to shameful death. After this he called a Parliament in the which he
attainted the Earl of Richmond and all other persons which were fled out of
the Realm for fear of any other cause, as enemies to him and their natural
country, and all their lands, goods, and possessions were confiscate and
seized to the Kings use. And yet not content with this prey which no doubt was
of no small value and moment, he laid on the peoples necks a great tax and
tollage, and surely necessity to that act in a manner compelled him. For what
with purging and declaring his innocence concerning the murder of his
Nephews toward the world, and what with cost to obtain the love and favor
of the commonaltie (which outwardly glosed and openly dissembled with him) he
gave prodigally so many and so great rewards, that now both he lacked and,
scarce knew honestly how to borrow.

In this troublous season, nothing was more marvelled at then that the Lord
Stanley had not been taken and reputed as an enemy to the King, considering
the working of the Lady Margaret his wife, mother to the Earl of Richmond: but
forasmuch as the enterprise of a woman was of him reputed of no regard or
estimation, and that the Lord Thomas her husband had purged himself
sufficiently to be innocent of all doings and attempts by her perpetrated and
committed, it was given him in charge to keep her in some secret place at
home, without having any servant or company, so that from thenceforth she
should never send letter nor messenger to her son nor any of his friend or
confederates, by the which the King might be molested or troubled, or any hurt
or prejudice might be attempted against his realm and commonaltie. Which
commandment was a while put in execution, and accomplished according to his
dreadful commandment. Yet the wild worm of vengeance wavering in his head,
could not be content with the death of diverse gentlemen suspected of treason,
but also he must extend his bloody fury against a poor gentleman called
Collingborne for making a small Rhyme of three of his unfortunat Councellers,
which were the Lord Lovell, sir Richard Radcliffe his mischievous minion, and
sir William Catesbey his secret seducer, which meeter was; The Rat, the Cat,
and Lovell our dog,
Rule all England
under the hog.


Meaning by the hog, the dreadful wild Bore which was the Kings cognisaunce:
but because the first line ended in dog, the metrician could not, observing the
regiments of meeter end the second verse in Bore, but called the Bore an hog;
This poetical Schoolmasters, corrector of breves and longs, caused
Collingborne to be abbreviated shorter by the head, and to be divided into
four quarters.

King Richard being thus tormented and tossed in his own conceit and
imagination, calling to his remembrance that considerations, amities and other
honest bonds and pacts, made, concluded and appointed between Princes and
politic governors are in the cause efficient, especial introduction that
their Realms and Countries are fortified and munited with a double power, that
is to say, with their own strength and the aid of their friends, devised with
himself to practice a league and amity with the King of Scotts, which not
long before had made diverse incursions and rodes into the Realm of England,
where although he got little, yet surely he lost not much, and thereupon sued
to have a truce or peace concluded, which came even as King Richard had wished
it. Wherefore commissioners were assigned for both parts to meet at Notingham
the seventh day next ensuing, at which time came thither for the King of
England, John Bishop of Lincoln* Chancellor of England, Richard Bishop of
Saint Ass, John Duke of Norfolk, Henry Earl of Northumb^rland, Thomas Lord
Stanley, George Stanley Lord Strange, John Gray Lord Powes, Richard Lord
Fitzhngh, John Gunthorpe, keeper of the Kings Privy Seal, Thomas Barow Master
of the Roules, sir Thomas Bryan chief Justice of the Common Place, sir Richard
Ratcliffe Knight, William Catesbey, and Richard Salkeld Esquiers. And for the
King of Scots were deputed Colin Earl of Ergile Lord Camp^ell, and Lord
Chancellor of Scotland, William Bishop of Aberden, Robert Lord Lyle, Laurence
Lord Oliphant, John Drummond of Stobhall, Archibald Qwitelator Archdeacon of
Lawdene and Secretary to King James, Lion K. of Arms, and Duncane Dundas.

When this league and amity was thus concluded, finished and sealed, with all
due circumstances thereunto required; although King Richard judged and deemed
himself somewhat the more strong and quiet by force of this new amity, and
concluded confederacy, yet to augement more the familiarity begun between
the King of Scots and him, and to have a double string for his bow, he
entreated a new aliance and marriage to be concluded between the Prince of
Rothsay eldest son to the King of Scots, and Lady Anne de la Poole, daughter to
John Duke of Suffolk, and Lady Anne sister to King Richard, which sister he so
much favored, that he studying all the ways by the which he might advance her
offspring and lineage, did not only procure and seek means how to make her
daughter a Princess, and consequently a Queen, but also after the death of
his son, he proclaimed John Earl of Lincoln his Nephew and her son, heir
apparent to the Crown of England, disinheriting King Edwards daughters, whose
brethren before you have heard he shamefully killed and murdered.

The King of Scots having need of Friends, but not so much need as King
Richard which was of necessity compelled to seek aiders, and to entertain
fautours, the one for favoring of flatterers and base borne persons, and the
other not only for tyranny and unnatural homicide, but also for the usurpation
of the Crown being of all the Realm detested and disdained, gladly accepted
and joyously consented to King Richards device and conjunction of amity,
perfectly remembering that amongst all bonds and obligations of love and amity,
that there is neither a surer nor a more perfect lock, then the knot of
conjunction in the Sacrament of Matrimony, which was in the very beginning of
the first age of man, ordained and instituted in the holy place of Paradise
terrestiall by God himself: by reason whereof, the propagation and succession
of the humane nature, stablished upon the sure seat of lawful Matrimony
between Princes, may nourish peace, concord and unity, assuage and break the
furious rage of truculent Mars and terrible battle, and increase love, favor
and familiarity. Wherefore the said Princes sent their Ambassadors and
Counselors again to the Town of Nottingham, where the said marriage was by
writings and instruments covenanted, condiscended and agreed, and affiances
made and taken by Procters and Deputies on both parts, and she immediately
called Princess of Rothsay, which name she shortly lost by the short life of
King Richard her loving Uncle. Here may well be noted the unnatural love and
disordered affection which this kind kinseman showed to his blood: for he not
remembering the tyranny that he had executed against his brothers sons, the
wrong and manifest injury that he had done to his brothers daughters, both in
taking from them their dignity, possessions and living, thought it should
redound greatly to his honor and fame, if he promoted his sisters child (to
whom he was nothing bound in conscience to make testification) to the dignity
of a Queen, rather then to prefer his brothers daughter whom he had untruly
and by force disinherited, and of all their right deprived, to the marriage of
a mean Esquire: such was his fraternall kindness toward his brother, and
such was his large conscience toward his brothers children.

After this league and Marriage thus concluded and agreed, the King of Scots
disdaining that the strong Castle of Dumbarre should remain in the Englishmens
hands and possession, wrote a gentle letter to K. Richard, declaring to him
that where in the league concluded between them, it was agreed and appointed
that he should within forty days next ensuing, express and declare his
opinion and meaning concerning the Castle of Dumbarre, whether the said castle
should be occupied and stand still in the hands of the Englishmen during the
whole time of the truce, or else for the time of six months only; He now
certified King Richard by his letters, that he was content that he and his
should enjoy the possession of the said Castle quietly and peaceably during the
said truce and amity. Nevertheless he required him for the love and
familiarity that now both by treaty and aliance was sprung and knit between
them, that he would redeliver the said Castle into his hands, which was
untruely possessed of the English nation by deliverie of rebels and traitors,
contrary to all right, equity, and conscience. King Richard dalied with
pleasant letters and fair words, and so fooled forth the King of Scots, that
he never had Dumbarre delivered while King Richard lived, after whose death,
whether it were by treason or by appointment, the Castle was rendered to the
King of Scots to his great contentation and rejoicing. Albeit this league and
amity thus covenanted and concluded, it might manifestly seem to all persons,
that all conjurations and confederacies against King Richard were extinct and
put to silence, and in especially cousidering tha the Duke of Buckingham and
his alies were made out of his way, some by death, and some by banishment and
exiling into far Countries and Regions: Yet King Richard more doubting then
trusting to his own people and friends, was continually vexed, tossed and
unquieted with fear of the return of the Earl of Richmond and his accomplices
and fautoures, which daily dread, and hourly agony, caused him to live in
doleful misery, ever unquiet, and in manner in continual calamity. Wherefore
he intending to be relieved, and to have all his dolorous imagination
alleviated, determined clearly to extirpate and pluck up all the matter and
ground of his fear and doubts. Wherefore after long and deliberate
consultation had, nothing was for his purpose and intent thought either more
necessary or expedient, then once again with price, prayer, and rewards, to
attempt the Duke of Britain, in whose territory the Earl of Richmond then
abode, to deliver the said Earl into his hands, by which only means he
should be discharged of all fear of peril, and brought to rest and
quietness both of body and mind. Wherefore incontinent he sent certain
Ambassadors to the Duke of Britain, which took upon them (besides the great
and ample rewards that they brought with them into Britain) that King Richard
should yearly pay and answer the Duke of all the revenues, rents, and profits,
of the signories, lands, and possessions, as well belonging and appertaining to
the Earl of Richmond, as to any other noble or gentleman which then were in
the Earls company, if he after that time would keep them in continual prison
and restrain them from liberty.

The Orators furnished with these and other instructions, arrived in Britain,
and came to the Dukes house, where with him they could have no manner of
communication concerning their weighty affairs, by reason that he being
fatigate and weakened by a long and daily infirmity, began a little to wax
idle and weak in his wit and remembrance. For which cause Peter Landoyse his
chief Treasurer, a man both of pregnant wit and great authority, ruled and
judged all things at his pleasure and commandment: for the which cause (as men
set into high authority be not best beloved) he excited and provoked against
him the malice and evil will of the nobility of Britain, which afterward
for diverse great offenses by him during his authority perpetrate and committed,
by their means was brought to death and confusion. The English Ambassadors
moved their message and request to Peter Landoyse, and to him declared their
Masters commandment, instantly requiring, and humbly desiring him (in whose
power it lay to do all things in Britain) that he would friendly assent to
the request of King Ri^hard, offering to him the same rewards of lands, that
they should have offered to the Duke.

This Peter which was no less disdayned then hated almost of all the people of
Britain, thought that if he did assent and satisfy King Richards Petition and
desire, he should be of power and ability sufficient to withstand and refell
the malicious attempts and inventions of his envious adversaries. Wherefore he
faithfully promised to accomplish King Richards request and desire, so that he
kept promise with him, that he might be able to withstand the cankered malice
of his secret enemies. This act that he promised to do, was not for any
grudge or malice that he bare to the Earl of Richmond, for as you have heard
before, he delivered him from peril of death at Saint Malos when he was in
great doubt of life and jeopardie, but as cause rises we ever offend, and that
cursed hunger of gold and execrable thirst of lucre, and inward fear of loss
of authority, drives the blind minds of covetous men and ambitious persons
to evils and mischiefs innumerable, not remembering loss of name, obloquie of
the people, nor in conclusion the punishment of God for their merits and
deserts. But fortune was so favorable to the public wealth of the Realm of
Enggland, that this deadly and dolorous compact took none effect or place. For
while posts ran, and letters were sent to and fro for the finishing of this
great enterprise between King Richard and Peter Landoyse* John Morton Bishop
of Ely sojourning then in Flaunders, was was of all this crafty conveighance
certified by his secret and sure friends: wherefore he sent Christopher
Vrswicke (which at that very season was come out of Britain into Flaunders)
to declare to the Earl of Richmond, how all the deceit and crafty working was
conveyed and compassed, giving him in charge to counsel and advise the Earl
in all haste possible with all his company to retire out of Britain into
France. When these news were brought to the Earl, he then kept house in
Vannes, and incontinent dispatched again Christopher Vrswike to Charles the
French K. requiring him that he and his might safely pass into France, which
desire, impetrated and obtained, the messenger shortly returned to his Lord and
Prince. The Earl well perceiving that it was expedient and necessary with all
speed and diligence, to look to this weighty matter, calling very few to
council, he made exploration and search of all secret and by ways, and sent
before all his noble men, as though for a certain familiarity and kindness
they should visit and comfort the Duke, which then for recreation and change of
air, lay on the borders and confines of France. And secretly he gave charge
to the Earl of Pembrooke, which was the leader and conducter of his company,
that when they approached the marches and limits of Britain, they should divert
and take the next way into France. The noble men somewhat suspicious of things
newly imagined, without any tarrying or by the journey gasing, scouring the
ways as fast as their horse would run, or as they conveniently might bear
and sustain, came out of the Duchy of Britain into the Duchy of Angeou in
the dominion of France, where they expected the Earls coming, which two days
after departed out of Vannes, only accompanied with five servitours, as though
he had gone to visit some familiar friend of his in a small village
adjoining. No man suspected that he would depart, considering that a great
multitude of Englishmen were left and continued in the city, but after he had
passed directly five miles forward, he suddenly turned into a solitary wood
next adjoining, where clothing himself in the simple coat of his poor
servant, made and appointed his said minister, leader and master of his small
company, and he as an humble page diligently followed and served his
counterfeit governor, never resting nor themselves refreshing, except the
bayting of their horses, till they by ways unknown, now this way, now turning
that way, came to their company abiding them in Angiers.

The fourth day after the Earl of Richmond was thus departed, that crafty
merchant Perter Landoyse, trusting still after his prey promised by King
Richard, was ready to set forward his crew of soldiers, which he privily had
consigned with certain trusty captains for that only purpose appointed and
elected, to perform and atchieve his pretensed enterprise, dissembling and
feigning them to be conducted and hired by him to serve the Earl of Richmond,
and him to conduct in his return toward his native country, meaning none
other thing but to apprehend him and the other noble men in his retinue, which
no such fraud suspecting, nor yet any treason imagining, unawares and
unprovided and destitute of all aid, and them to cast and detrude suddenly
into continual captivity and bondage, to the intent that by this facinorous
and naughty act, he might satisfy the charitable request and loving desires of
good K. Richard, more for his own profit then for King Richards gain. But
when this crafty dissembler Peter Landoyse, which was no wiliar then an old
Fox, perceived that the Earl was departed (thinking that to be true that he
imagined) Lord how curriours ran into every coast, how light-horsemen galloped
to every street to follow and detain him, i^ by any possibility he could be
subsecuted and overtaken, and him to incarcerate and bring captive into the
city of Vannes. The horsemen made such diligence, and with such celeritie set
forward their journey, that nothing was more likely then they to have obtained,
yea and seized their prey. For the Earl of Richmond was not entered into the
Realm of France scarce one hour, but the followers came to the limits and
confines of Britain, and durst adventure no further, but vainly without their
desire sorrowfully returned. At which season were left at Vannes about the
number of three Englishmen, which not being called to counsel, and unawares of
this enterprise, but knowing of the Earls sudden departure, were so
incontinently astonished, that in a manner they were all in despair both of him
and their own security and safeguard. But fortune turned her sail, and
otherwise it happened then their fear them incombred. For the Duke of Britain
now being somewhat recovered, was sore displeased, and nothing contented that
the Earl of Richmond was in his dominion so uncurteously tracted and
entreated, that he should be by fraud and untruth compelled to leave and fly
out of his Duchy and country contrary to his honor. Wherefore he took great
displeasure with Peter Landoyse his Treasurer, to whom (although he knew not
and was ignorant that all the drift was driven and devised by him) he laid the
fault and imputed the crime. Wherefore he sent for Edward Woodvile, and Edward
Powninges valiant Esquiers of England, and delivered unto them money sufficient
for their conduct, willing them them to convey the rest of the Englishmen being
in Britain, to the Earl of Richmonds presence.

When the Earl was thus furnished and appointed with his trusty company, and
was escaped all the dangerous labyrinthes and snares that were set for him, no
marvel though he were jocund and glad of the prosperous success that happened
in his affairs. Wherefore lest he should seem to be blotted with the note of
ingratitude, he sent diverse of his gentlemen to the Duke of Britain, the
which should publish and declare to him on the behalf of the Earl, that he
and his were only by his benefit and favor conserved and delivered from the
imminent danger that they were like to be trapped in. Wherefore at that time he
rendered to him most hearty thanks in words, trusting and not doubting, but in
time to come liberally to recompense him with acts and deeds.

After this, the Earl took his journey to Charles the French King, living
then at Langes, upon the river of Leyre, to whom after great thanks given for
manifold gratuities by him to the Earl showed, he disclosed and manifested
the cause and occasion of his access and repair to his person. After that he
required of him help and succor, to the intent that by his immortal benefit
to him at that time showed, he might safely return to the nobility of his
Realm, of whom he was generally called to take upon him the Crown and Scepter
of the Realm, they so much hated and abhorred the tyranny of King Richard.
King Charles promised him aid and comfort, and bad him be of good courage and
make good cheer, for he assured him that he would gladly show to him his
benevolent mind and bountiful liberality. Which King from thence removed to
Mountargis, leading with him the Earl of Richmond, and all the noble
personages of his retinue and faction.

While the Earl was thus attendant in the French Court, John Vere Earl of
Oxford (which as you have heard before, was by King Edward kept in prison
within the Castle of Hammes) so persuaded John Blunt captain of the same
fortress, and sir John Fortescewe porter of the town of Caleys, that he
himself was not only dismissed and set at liberty, but they also abandoning
and leaving their fruitful offices, condiscended to go with him into France
to the Earl of Richmond and to take his part. But James Blunt like a wise
captain, because he left his wife remaining in the Castle before his
departure, he fortified the same both with new inventions and new soldiers.
When the Earl of Richmond saw the Earl of Oxford, he was ravished with an
incredible gladness, that he being a man of so high nobility, of such
knowledge and practice in feats of war, and so constant, trusty and assured
(which always had studied for the maintenance and preferment of the house of
Lancaster) was now by Gods provision delivered out of captivity and
imprisonment, and in time so necessary and convenient come to his aid,
succor, and advancement, in whom more sure then any other he might put his
trust and confidence, and take less pain and travile in his own person. For
it was not hid from him, that such as had ever taken pains with King Edward
before this time, came to do him service either for malice that they bare to
K. Richard, or else for fear to fall under his truculent rule and tempestuous
government. But this man which so often times had personally fought in mortal
battle in the quarrel of King Henry the Sixth, he judged by divine power and
heavenly inspiration to be delivered out of captivity and imprisonment for
this only purpose, that he should have a man of his own faction and school,
to whom he might surely and faithfully communicate and credit all things as to
his own proper person, and therefore being inflamed with an immortal joy for
the Earls coming, he began to have a good hope of the happy success of
all his pretensed enterprises.

Not long after, the French King returned again to Paris, whom the Eale of
Richmond followed, intending there to solicit his matter to the conclusion
Whereupon he besought King Charles to take upon him the whole tuition and
defense of him and his cause, so that he and his company being by his means
aided and comforted, should confess and say, their wealth, victory and
advancement to have flowed and budded forth of his bountifulness and
liberality, which they would God willing shortly require. In the mean season
diverse Englishmen, which either fled out of England for fear, or were at Paris
to learn and study good literature and virtuous doctrine came voluntarily and
submitted themselves to the Earl of Richmond, and vowed and swear to take his
part. Amonst whom was Richard Fox a Priest, a man of great wit, and no less
learning, whom the Earl incontinent received into secret familiarity, and in
brief time erected and advanced him to high dignities and promotions, and in
conclusion he made him Bishop of Winchester.

In the mean season King Richard was credibly advertised what promises and
oaths the Earl and his confederates had made and sworn together at Renes,
and how by the Earls means all the Englishmen were passed out of Britain into
France. Wherefore being sore dismayed, and in manner desperate, because his
crafty mischief took no effect in Britain, imagined and devised how to
infringe and disturb the Earls purpose by another mean, so that by the
marriage of Lady Elizabeth his niece, he should pretend no claim nor title to
the Crown. For he thought if that marriage failed, the Earls chief comb
had been clearly cut. And because that he being blinded with the ambitious
desire of rule before this time, in obtaining the kingdom, had perpetrate and
done many flagitious acts and detestable tyrannies, yet according to the old
proverb, let him take the bull that stole away the calfe, he thought all
facts by him committed in times past to be but of small moment and not to be
regarded in comparison of that mischievous imagination which he now newly
began and attempted. There came into his ungratious mind a thing not only
detestable to be spoken of in the remembrance of man, but much more cruel and
abominable to be put in execution. For when he revolved in his wavering mind
how great a fountain of mischief toward him should spring, if the Earl of
Richmond should be advanced to the marriage of his niece, which thing he heard
say by the rumor of her people, that no small number of wise and witty
personages enterprised to compass and bring to conclusion.

He clearly determined to reconcile to his favor his Brother wife, Queen
Elizabeth, eithers by fair words or liberal promises, firmly believing her
favor once obtained, that she would not stick to commit and lovingly credit
to him the rule and governance both of her and her daughters, and so by that
means the Earl of Richmond of the affinity of his Niece should be utterly
defrauded and beguiled. And if no ingenuous remedy could be otherwise invented
to save the innumerable mischiefs which were even at hand, and like to fall,
if it should happen Queen Anne his wife to depart out of this present world,
then he himself would rather take to wife his cousin and niece, the Lady
Elizabeth, then for lack of that affinity the whole Realm should run to
ruin, as who said, that if he once fell from his estate and dignity, the
ruin of the Realm must needs shortly ensue and follow. Wherefore he sent to
the Queen, being in Sanctuary, diverse and often Messengers, which first should
excuse and purge him of all things before against her attempted or procured,
and after should so largely promise promotions innumerable and benefits, not
only to her, but also to her son Lord Thomas Marquess Dorset, that they
should bring her if it were possible into some wan hope, or as men say, into a
fools paradise. The Messengers being men both of wit and gravitie, so
persuaded the Queen with great and pregnant reasons, then with fair and large
promises, that she began somewhat to relent, and to give to them no deaf ear,
insomuch that she faithfully promised to submit and yield her self fully and
frankly to the Kings will and pleasure. And so she putting in oblivion the
murder of her innocent children, the infamy and dishonor spoken by the King
her husband, the living in adultry laid to her charge, bastarding of her
daughters, forgetting also the faithful promise and open oath made to the
Countess of Richmond mother to the Earl Henry, blinded by avaritious
affection, and seduced by flattering words, first delivered into King Richards
hands her five daughters, as Lambs once again committed to the custody of the
ravenous Wolf.

After she sent Letters to the Marquess her son, being then at Paris with
the Earl of Richmond, willing him in any wise to leave the Earl, and without
delay to repair into England, where for him were provided great honors and
honorable promotions, ascertaining him further, that all offenses in both
parties were forgotten and forgiven, and both he and she highly incorporate in
the Kings heart. Surely the inconstancy of this woman were much to be
marvelled at, if all women had bin found constant, but let men speak, yet
women of the very bond of Nature will follow their own kind.

After that King Richard had thus with glorious promises and flattering words
pleased and appeased the mutable mind of Queen Elizabeth, which knew nothing
less then that he most intended, he caused all his brothers daughters to be
conveyed into his Palace with solemn receiving, as though with his new
familiar and loving entertainment they should forget, and in their minds
obliterate the old committed injury and late perpetrate tyranny.

Now nothing was contrary and opposite to his pernicious purpose, but that his
Mansion was not void of his wife, which thing he in any wise adjudged necessary
to be done. But there was one thing that so much feared and dragged him from
committing this abominable murder, because, as you have heard before, he began
to counterfeit the image of a good and well disposed person, and therefore he
was afraid lest the sudden and immature death of his wife once openly known,
he should lose the good and credible opinion which the people had of him
without desert conceived and reported. But in conclusion, evil counsel
prevailed in a wit lately minded to mischief, and turned from all goodness.
So that his ungratious desire overcame his honest fear.

And first to enter into the gates of his imagined enterprise, he abstayned
both from the bed and company of his wife. After he complained to diverse Noble
men of the Realm, of the unfortunate sterilitie and barrenness o^ his wife,
because she brought forth no fruit and generation of her body. And in special
he accounted to Thomas Rotheram Archbishop of York (whom lately he had
delivered out of ward and captivity) these impediments of his Queen and diverse
others, thinking that he would reveal and open to her all these things,
trusting the sequel hereof to take his effect, that she hearing this grudge
of her husband, and taking therefore an inward thought, would not long live in
this world. Of this the Bishop gathered (which well knew the complexion and
usage of the King) that the Queens days were short, and that he declared to
certain of his secret friends. And thus he procured a common rumor (but he
would not have the author known) to be published and spread abro^d among the
common people that the Q^eene was dead, to the intent that she taking some
conceit of this strange fame, should fall into some sudden sickness or grievous
malady, and to prove if afterward she sh^^ld fortune by that or any other
ways to lose her life, whether the people would impute her death to the
thought or sickness, or thereof would lay the blame to him. When the Queen heard
tell that so horrible a rumor of her death was sprung amongst the commonaltie,
she sore suspected and judged the world to be almost at an end with her, and
in that sorrowful agony, she with lamentable countenance and sorrowful
cheer, repaired to the presence of the King her husband, demanding of him,
what it should mean that he had judged her worthy to die. The King answered
her with fair words* and with dissembling blandiments and flattering leasings
comforted her, bidding her to be of good comfort, for to his knowledge she
should have no other cause. But howsoever it fortuned, either by inward thought
and pensiveness of heart, or by intoxication of poison (which is affirmed to
be most likely) within a few days after, the Queen departed out of this
transitory life, and was with due solemnity buried in the church of S. Peter
at Westminster. This is the same Anne, one of the daughters of the Earl of
Warwick, which as you have heard before, at the request of Jews the French
King, was married to Prince Edward, son to King Henry the Sixth.

The King thus (according to his long desire) loosed out of the bonds of
matrimony, began to cast a foolish fantasy to Lady Elizabeth his niece,
making much suite to have her joined with him in lawful matrimony: But because
all men, and the maiden her self most of all, detested and abhorred this
unlawful and in a manner unnatural copulation, he determined to prolong and
d^fer the matter till he were in a more quietness. For all that very season
he was oppressed with great, weighty, and urgent causes and businesses on
every side, considering, that daily part of the nobility sailed into France to
the Earl of Richmond: other privily favored and aided certain of the
conjuration, so that of his short end, few or none were in doubt. And the
common people for the most part were brought to such desperation, that many of
them had rather be reputed and taken of him in the number of his enemies, then
to abide the chance and hazard to have their goods taken as a spoil of
victory by his enemies Amongst the noble men whom he most mistrusted, these
were the principal, Thomas Lord Stanley, Sir William Stanley his brother,
Gilbert Talbot and six hundred other, of whose purposes although King Richard
were ignorant yet he gave neither confidence nor credence to any one of them,
and least of al to the Lord Stanley, because he was joined in matrimony with
the Lady Margaret mother to the Earl of Richmond, as afterward apparently ye
may perceive. For when the said Lord Stanley would have departed into his
Country to visit his family, and to recreate and refresh his spirits (as he
openly said) but the truth was to the intent to be in a perfect readiness to
receive the Earl of Richmond at his first arrival into England: the King in
no wise would suffer him to depart, before he had left as an hostage in the
Court, George Stanley Lord Strange his first begotten son and heir. While King
Richard was thus troubled and vexed with imaginations of the tumultuous time
that was like to come: Lo even suddenly he heard news that fire was sprung
out of the smoke, and the war presently begun, and that the Castle of Hammes
was delivered into the hands of the Earl of Richmond by the means of the
Earl of Oxford, and that not only he, but also James Blunt Captain of the
Castle, were fled into France to aid the Earl Henry. Wherefore he thinking it
great policy to withstand the first brunt, sent the most part of the garrison
of Calice, to recover again by force the castle of Hammes. They which were in
the Castle perceiving their adversaries to approach, prepared munitions and
engines for their defense, and sent also the Earl of Richmond, to advertise him
of their sudden obsession, requiring him of hasty aid and speedy succor.
The Earl slipping not this first begun assault, sent the Earl of Oxford with
an elected company of Soldiers to raise the siege and rescue the Castle: Which
at their first arriving pitched their camp not far from their enemies And
while King Richards men gave vigilant eye, weighing lest the Earl of Oxford
should take any advantage of them that lay on that side of the Castle, Thomas
Brandon with thirty approved men of war by a marish which lay on the other
side entered into the Castle. The soldiers within greatly anim^^ed and much
comforted by this new succor and aid grieved the enemies by shooting from the
wall more then they were accustomed to do. And they of the Castle vexed their
enemies on the forepart: the Earl of Oxford no less molested and unquieted
them on the other part, which was the occasion that King Richards men offered
of their own mere motion license to all being within the Castle to depart in
safety with bag and baggage nothing excepted: which condition the Earl of
Oxford, coming only for that purpose to deliver his loving friends out of all
peril and danger, and chiefly of all, his old hostess Jane Blunt wife to
James Blunt the Captain, would in no wise repudiate or refuse. And so leaving
the Castle bare and ungarnished both of vitaile and artillery, came safe to the
Earl of Richmond sojourning in Paris. During this time, King Richard was
credibly informed of his explorators and espials, that the Earl of Richmond
was with long suite in the Court of France sore fatigate and wearied, and
desiring great aid, could obtain small relief. In so much that all things
went so far backward, that such things as were with great diligence and no
less deliberation purposed and determined to be set forward, were now dashed
and overthrown to the ground. King Richard either being to light of credence,
or seduced and deluded by his crafty taletellers, greatly rejoiced as though
he had obtained the ooverhand of his enemies with triumph and victory, and
thought himself never so surely delivered of all fear and dreadful
imaginations so that he needed now no more once for that cause either to wake
or break his golden sleep. Wherefore he called home again his ships of war
which he had appointed to keep the narrow seas, and dispatched all such
soldiers as he had deputed to keep certain garrisons, and to stop certain
passages, as you have heard before. Yet lest he might for lack of provision
be suddenly trapped, he straightly charged and gave in commandment to all
noble men, and in especial such as inhabited near to the Sea coast, and on the
frontiers of Wales, that according to the usage of the country, they should
keep diligent watch and strong ward, to the intent that his adversaries in no
wise should have any place apt or oportune easily to take land without defense
or rebutting back. For the custom of the Countries adjoining near to the
Sea is (especially in the time of war) on every hill or high place to erect a
Beacon with a great lantern in the top, which may be seen and discerned a
great space off. And when the noise is once bruted that the enemy approaches
near the land, they suddenly put fire in the lanthornes, and make shoutes and
outrages from town to town, and from village to village. Some run in post
from place to place, admonishing the people to be ready to resist the
jeopardy, and defend the peril. And by this policy the fame is soon blown to
every city and town, insomuch that as well the citizens as the rural people
be in short space assembled and armed to refell and put back the new arrived
enemies.

Now to return to our purpose: King Richard thus alleviate of his accustomed
pensiveness, began to be somewhat more merrier, and took less thought and
care for outward enemies then he was wont to do, as who say, that he with
politic provisio^ should withstand the destiny which hung over his head, and
was ordained in brief time suddenly to fall. Such is the force and puissance
of divine justice, that every man shall less regard, less provide, less be
in doubt of all things, when he is most nearest punishment, and next to his
mischance for his offenses and crimes.

About this season, while the Earl of Richmond was desiring aid of the French
King, certain noble men were there appointed to rule the Realm of France
during the minority of King Charles, which amongst themselves were not of one
opinion. Of which dissension, Jews Duke of Orleance was the chief stirrer,
which because he had married Lady Iohanne sister to the French King, took upon
him above other the rule and administration of the whole Realm. By reason of
which controversy, no one man only was suffered to rule all, wherefore the
Earl of Richmond was compelled to make suite to every one of the Council
severally one after another, requiring and desiring them of aid and relief in
his weighty business, and so his cause was prolonged and deferred. During
which time, Thomas Marquis Dorset, which was as you have heard entised by his
mother to return again into England, partly despairing in the good success
of the Earl of Richmond, and partly onerate and vanquished with the fair
glosing promises of King Richard, secretly in the night season stole out of
Paris, and with all diligent expediton took his journey toward Flanders. When
relation of his departure was made to the Earl of Richmond and the other Noble
men, no marvel though they were astonished and greatly amassed. Yet that
notwithstanding they required of the French King that it might be lawful for
them in his name and by his commandment to take and stay their companion,
confederate, and partaker of all their council, in what place within his
Realm and territory wheresoever they could find him. Which petition once
obtained, they sent out curriers into every part, amongst whom Humfrey Cheiny
playing the part of a good blood hound, followed the tract of the flyer so even
by the sent, that he overtooke and apprehended him not far from Comprigne,
and so what with reason, and what with fair promises being persuaded, he
returned again to his companions. The Earl of Richm^nd unburdened of this
misadventure; lest by procrastination of days, and prolonging of time, he
might lose the great opportunity of things to him offered and ministered: also
lest he should further wound or molest the minds of his faithful and assured
friends which daily did expect and tarry for his coming, determined no longer
to protract and defer the time* but with all diligence and celerity to
attempt his begun enterprise, and so obtaining of King Charles a small crew
of men, and borrowing certain sums of money of him and of diverse other his
private friends. For the which he left as debtor, or more likelyer as a pledge
or hostage, Lord Thomas Marquis Dorset, (whom he half mistrusted) and Sir John
Bur^hier he departed from the French Court, and came to the City of Roan.
While he tarried there making provision at Bartfleet in the mouth of the River
of Seyne for all things necessary for his navy and navigation, tidings were
brought to him, that King Richard being without children and now widdower,
intended shortly to marry with Lady Elizabeth his brothers daughter, and to
prefer the Lady Cicile her sister to a man found in a cloud and of an
unknown lineage and family. He took this news as a matter of no small moment
(and so al things considered, it was of no less importance then he took it
for.) For this thing only took away from all his companions their hope and
courage that they had to obtain an happy enterprise. And therefore no marvel
though it nipped him at the very heart, when he thought that by no possibility
he might attain the marriage of any of King Edwards daughters, which was the
strongest foundation of his building, by reason whereof he judged that al his
friends in England would abandon and ^hrinke from him. Wherefore making not
many of his counsel, after diverse consultations he determined not yet to set
forward, but to tarry and attempt how to get more aid, more friends, and more
stronger succors. And amongst all other, it was thought most expedient to
allure by affinity in his aid as a companion in arms Sir Walter Harbert, a
man of ancient stock and great power amongst the welshmen, which had with him a
fair Lady to his sister, of age mature and ripe to be coupled in matrimony.
And for the achiving of this purpose, messengers were secretly sent to Henry
Earl of Northumberland (which had before married another sister of Sir Walter
Herberts) to the intent that he should set forward all this device and
purpose: but the ways were so narrowly watched, and so many spies laid, that
the messenger proceeded not in his journey and business. But in the mean
season, there came to the Earl a more joyful message from Morgan Kidwelly
learned in the temporal Law, which declared that Ryce ap Thomas, a man of no
less valiantness then activitie, and John Savage an approved Captain, would
with all their power be partakers of his quarrel: And that Reighnold Bray had
collected and gotten together no small some of money for the payment of the
wages to the soldiers and men of war: admonishing him also to make quick
expedition, and to take his course directly into Wales. The Earl of Richmond
because he would no longer linger and weary his friends living continually
between hope and fear, determined in all convenient have to set forward, and
carried to his ships armor, weapons, victuals* and all other ordinances
expedient for war. And shortly to speak, all things he prepared which were
wont to be necessary and profitable to the variable chances and incertaine
accidents and jeopardies of war, which requires preparation of many
instruments and things chargable.

And that the Earl had made his humble petition and devout prayer to almighty
God, beseeching him not only to send him most prosperous wind and sure
passage in his journey, but also effectuously desiring his goodness of aid
and comfort in his necessity, and victory and supremitie over his enemies,
only accompanied with two thousand men, and a small number of ships, weighed
up his anchors, and hoysed up his sails, and in the calends of August he
sailed from Harfleet with so prosperous a wind, that the seventh day after his
departure he arrived in Wales in the evening at a port called Milford Haven,
and incontinent took land, and came to a place called Dalle, where he heard
say that a certain company of his adversaries were laid in garrison to defend
his arrival all the last winter And the Earl at the ^un rising removed to
Harford W^st, being distant from Dalle not fully ten miles, where he was
applauded and received of the people with great joy, and he arrived there so
suddenly, that he was come and entered the town at the same time when the
Citizens had but knowledge of his coming. Here he heard news which was as
untrue, as they truly were reported to him in Normandy, that Rice ap Thomas,
and John Savage with body and goods were determined to aid King Richard. While
he and his company were somewhat appalled of these new tidings, there came such
message from the inhabitants of the town of Pembrook, that refreshed and
revived their frosen hearts and daunted courages. For Arnould Butler a valliant
Captain, which first asking pardon for his offenses before time committed
against the Earl of Richmond, and that obtained, declared that the
Penbrochians* were ready to serve and give their attendance on their natural
and immediate Lord Jasper Earl of Pembrooke. The Earl of Richmond having his
army thus increased, departed from Herford West to the town of Cardigan,
being five mile distant from thence. While the soldiers were refreshing and
trimming themselves in their camp, strange tidings sprung among them without
any certain author, that Sir Walter Harberd, which lay with a great crew of
men at Carmarden, was now with a great army ready to approach and bid him
battle. With which news the army was sore troubled, and every man assaid
his armor and proved his weapon and were pressed to defend their enemies. And as
they were in this timorous doubt, certain horsemen which the Earl had sent to
make exploration and search, returned and reported all the country to be
quiet, and no let nor impediment to be laid or cast in their journey. And even
at that same time the whole army was greatly recomforted, by reason that the
coming of Richard Griffeth, a man of great nobility, the which notwithstanding
that he was conversant with Sir Walter Harbert and Richard ap Thomas, yet at
that very instant he came to the Earl of Richmond with all his company, which
were of no great number. After him, the same day came John Morgan with his men.
Then the Earl advanced forward in good have, making no repose or abode in any
one place. And to the intent to pass forward with sure and short expedition,
he assaulted every place where his enemies had set any men of war, which
with small force and less difficulty he briefly did expugne and vanquish.
And suddenly he was by his espials ascertained that Sir Walter Harbert and
Rice ap Thomas were in harness before him ready to encounter with his army and
to stop their passage. Wherefore like a valiant captain he first determined
to set on them, and either to destroy or to take them into his favor, and
after with all his power and puissance to give battle to his mortal enemy
King Richard. But to the intent his friends should know with what dexterity
his attempted enterprise proceeded forward, he sent of his most secret and
faithful servants with letters and instructions to the Lady Margaret his
mother, to the Lord Stanley and his brother, to Talbot^ and to other his trusty
friends, declaring to them, that he succored and helped with the aid and
relief of his friends intended to pass over the river of Siverne at
Shrewesbury, and so to pass directly to the city of London, requiring them,
as his especial trust and confidence was perplanted in the hope of their
fidelity, that they would occur and meet him by the way with all diligent
preparation, to the intent that he and they at time propice and place
convenient might communicate together the profunditie and deepenesse of all his
dubious and weighty business. When the messengers were disparcled with these
commandments and admonitions, he marched forwards toward Shrewesbury, and in
his passing, there met and saluted him Rice ap Thomas with a goodly band of
Welshmen, which making an oath and promise to the Earl, submitted himself
wholly to his order and commandment. For the Earl of Richmond two days before
made to him promises that if he would swear to take his part and be obedient
to him, he would make him chief governor of Wales; which part as he
faithfully promised and granted, so after that he had obtained and possessed
the Realm and diadem, he liberally performed and accomplished the same. In
the mean time, the messengers that were sent, diligently executed the things
given to them in charge, and laden with rewards of them to whom they were sent,
returned to him the same day that he entered into Shrewesbury, and made relation
to him that his friends were ready in all points to do all things for him
which either they ought or might do. The Earl Henry brought in good hope with
his pleasant message, continued forth his intended journey and came to a
little town called Newport and, pitching his camp on a little hill adjoining,
reposed himself there that night. In the evening, the same day came to him Sir
George Talbot with the whole power of the young Earl of Shrewesbury then being
inward, which were accounted to the number of two thousand men. And thus his
power increasing he arrived at the town of Stafford, and there pawsed. To whom
came Sir William Stanley accompanied with a few persons, and after that the
Earl and he had communed no long time together, he reverted to his soldiers
which he had congregate together to serve the Earl, which from thence
departed to Lichfield, and lay without the walls in his camp all the night.
The next morning he entered into the town, and was with all honor like a
Prince received. A day or two before the Lord Stanley having in his band almost
five thousand men, lodged in the the same town, but hearing that the Earl of
Richmond was marched thitherward, gave to him place, dislodging him and his,
and repaired to a town called Adrestone, there abiding the coming of the
Earl; and this wily Fox did this act to avoid all suspicion, being afraid
lest if he should be seen openly to be a fautour or ayder to the Earl his
son in law before the day of the battle, that King Richard which did not
utterly put in him diffidence and mistrust, would put to some cruel death his
son and heir apparent, George Lord Strange, whom King Richard, as you have
heard before, kept with him as a pledge or hostage to the intent that the Lord
Stanley his father should attempt nothing prejudicial to him.

King Richard at this season keeping his house in the Castle of Nottingham, was
informed that the Earl of Richmond with such banished men as fled out of
England to him were now arrived in Wales, and that all things necessary to his
enterprise were unprovided, unpurveyed and very weak, nothing meet to
withstand the power of such as the King had appointed to resist him. This
rumor so inflated his mind, that in manner disdaining to hear speak of so
poor a company, determined at the first to take little or no regard to this so
small a sparcle, declaring the Earl to be innocent and unwise because that
he temerariously attempted such a great enterprise with so small and thin a
number of warlike persons, and therefore he gave a definitive sentence, that
when he came to that point that he should be compelled to fight against his
will, he either should be apprehended alive, or else by all likelihood he
should of necessity come to a shameful confusion, and that he trusted to be
shortly done by Sir Walter Herbert and Rice ap Thomas, which then ruled Wales
with equal power and like authority. But he revolving and casting in his
mind that a small war begun and winked at, and not regarded, may turn to a
great broyle and tumultuous trouble, and that it was prudent policy not to
asperne and disdain the little small power and weakness of the enemy, be it
never so small, thought it necessary to provide for after clappes that might
happen and chance. Wherefore he sent to John Duke of Norfolk, Henry Earl of
Northumberland, Thomas Earl of Surrey, and to other of his especial and
trusty friends of the nobility, which he judged much more to prefer and
esteem his wealth and honor then their own riches and private commodity,
willing them to muster and view all their servants and tenants, and to elect
and choose the most courageous and active persons of the whole number, and with
them to repair to his presence with all speed and diligence. Also he wrote to
Robert Brak^nbury Lieutenant of the Tower, commanding him with his power to
come to his army, and to bring with him as fellows in arms Sir Thomas
Burchier, and sir Walter Hungerford, and diverse other Knights and Esquiers in
whom he had cast no small suspicion.

While he was thus ordering his affairs, tidings came that the Earl of
Richmond was passed Severne and come to Shrewesbury without any detriment or
encombrance. At which message he was sore moved and broyled with Melancholy
and dolor, and cried out, asking vengeance of them that contrary to their
oaths and promises had fraudulently deceived him. For which cause he began
to have diffidence in others, in so much that he determined himself out of
hand the same day to occur and resist his adversaries; And in all haste sent
out explorators to view and epsy what way his enemies kept and passed. They
diligently doing their duty, shortly after returned, declaring to the King
that the Earl was encamped at the Town of Lichfield. When he had perfect
knowledge where the Earl with his army was sojourning, he having continual
repair of his subjects to him, began incontinently without delay to marshall
and collocate in order his battles (like a valiant captain and politic
leader) and first he made his battles to set forward four and four in a
rank, marching toward that way whither his enemies, as was to him reported,
intended to pass. In the middle part of the army he appointed the traffic
and carriage appertaining to the army. Then he (environed with his satellites
and yeomen of the Crown) with a frowning countenance and truculent aspect
mounted on a great white courser, followed with his footmen, the wings of
horsemen coasting and ranging on every side: And keeping this array, he with
great pomp entered the town of Leiceste after the sun set. The Earl of
Richmond raised his camp and departed from Lichfield to the town of Tomworth
thereto near adjoining, and in the mid way passing, there saluted him Sir
Walter Hungerford, and sir Thomas Burchier Kinghts, and diverse other, which
yielded and submitted themselves to his pleasure. For they being advertised
that King Richard had them in suspicion and jelousie, a little beyond Stony
stratford left and forsook privily their Captain Robert Brakenbury, and by
nocturnall wandering, and in manner by unknown paths and uncertain ways
searching, at the last came to the Earl Henry. Diverse other noble personages
which inwardly hated King Richard worse then a toade or a serpent, likewise to
him resorted with their power and strength. There happened in this progression
to the Earl of Richmond a strange chance worthy to be noted: for albeit he was
a man of hautie and valiant courage, and that his army increased, and daily
more and more he waxed puisaunt and stronger, yet he was not a little afraid
because he in no wise could be assured of his father in law Thomas. Lord
Stanley, which for fear of the destruction of the Lord Strange his son (as
you have heard) as yet inclined to neither party. For if he had gone to the
Earl, and that notified to King Richard, his son had shortly been executed.
Wherefore since the Earls fear sprang not of nothing, he accompanied with
twenty light horsemen lingered in his journey as a man disconsolate, musing and
imagining what was best to be done. And the more to aggravate his melancholy
pensiveness, it was showed him that King Richard was at hand with a strong
power and a populous army. While he thus pensive dragged behind his host, the
whole army came before the town of Tomwoorth, and when he for the deep
darkness could not perceive the steps of them that passed on before, and
had wandered hither and thither, seeking after his company, and yet not once
hearing any noise or whispering of them, he diverted to a little village being
about three miles from his army, taking great thought, and much fearing lest
he should be espied and so trapped by K. Richards scoutwatch. There he
tarried all night, not once adventuring to ask or demand a question of any
creature, he being no more amassed with the jeopardy and peril that was passed,
then with this present chance, sore feared it should be a prognostication or
prodigiall sign of some unfortunate plague afterward to succeed. As he was
not merry being absent from his company, likewise his army much marvelled and
no less mourned for his sudden and in tempestious absence.

The next morning early in the dawning of the day he returned, and by the
conduct of good fortune espied and came to his army, excusing himself, not to
have gone out of his way by ignorance, but for a policy devised for the nonce
he went from his camp to receive some glad message from certain of his privy
friends and secret alies. This excuse made, he privilie departed again from
his host to the town of Aderstone, where the Lord Stanley and sir William his
brother with their bands were abiding. There the Earl came first to his
fatherinlaw in a little close, where he saluted him and sir William his
brother, and after diverse congratulations and many friendly embracings, each
rejoiced of the state of the other, and suddenly were surprised with great joy,
comfort, and hope of great fortunate success in all their affairs and doings.
Afterward they consulted together how to give battle to K. Richard if he
would abide, whom they knew not to be far off with an huge army. In the evening
of the same day, sir John Savage, sir Brian Sanford, sir Simon Digby, and many
other, leaving King Richard, turned and came to the part of the Earl of
Richmond with an elect company of men. Which refusal of King Richards part by
men of such experience, did augment and increase both the good hope and the
puissance of the Earl of Richmond.

In the mean season King Richard (which was appointed now to finish his last
labor by the very divine justice and providence of God, which called him to
condign punishment for his scelerate merits and mischievous deserts) marched
to a place meet for two battles to encounter by a village called Bosworth,
not far from Leicester, and there he pitched his field, refreshed his
soldiers, and took his rest.

The fame went that he had that same night a dreadful and terrible dream;
for it seemed to him being asleep, that he saw diverse images like terrible
devils, which pulled and haled him, not suffering him to take any quiet or
rest. The which strange vision not so suddenly struck his heart with a sudden
fear, but it stuffed his head and troubled his mind with many dreadful and
busy Imaginations.

For incontinent after, his heart being almost damped, he prognosticated
before the doubtful chance of the battle to come, not using the alacrity
and mirth of mind and of countenance as he was accustomed to do before he
came toward the battle. And lest that it might be suspected that he was
abashed for fear of his enemies, and for that cause he looked so pitifully,
he recited and declared to his familiar friends in the morning his wonderful
vision and terrible dream. But I think this was no dream, but a punction and
prick of his sinful conscience; for the conscience is so much more charged
and aggravate, as the offense is greater and more heinous in degree: which
prick of conscience although it strike not always, yet at the last day of
extreme life it is wont to show and represent to us our faults and offenses,
and the pains and punishments which hang over our heads for the same, to the
intent that at the instant we for our deserts being penitent and repentant may
be compelled to lament and bewail our sins like forsakers of this world,
jocund to depart out of this miserable life.

Now to return again to our purpose, the next day after, K. Richard being
furnished with men and all abiliments of wa^, bringing all his men out of their
camp into the plain, ordered his foreward in a mavelous length, in which
he appointed both horsemen and footmen, to the intent to imprint in the hearts
of them that looked a far off, a sudden terror and deadly fear, for the
great multitude of the armed soldiers: and in the fore front he placed the
archers like a strong fortified trench or bulwark: over this battle was
captain John Duke of Norfolk, with whom was Thomas Earl of Surrey his son.
After this long vangard followed King Richard himself, with a strong company
of chosen and approved men of war, having horsemen for wings on both the
sides of his battle.

After that the Earl of Richmond was departed from the communicatio^ of his
friends as you have heard before, he began to be of a better stomach, and of
a more valiant courage, and with all diligence pitched his field just by the
Camp of his enemies, and there he lodged that night. In the morning betime he
caused his men to put on their armor, apparel themselves ready to fight and
give battle, and sent to the Lord Stanley (which was now come with his Band in
a place indifferently between both the Armies) requiring him with his men to
approach near to his Army, and to help to set the Soldiers in array* he
answered, that the Earl should set his own men in a good order of battle,
while he would array his company, and come to him in time convenient: Which
answer made otherwise then the Earl thought or would have judged, considering
the opportunity of the time, and the weight of the business, and although he
was therewithal a little vexed, began somewhat to hang the head, yet he
without any time delaying, compelled by necessity, after this manner instructed
and ordered his men. He made his fore-ward somewhat single and slender,
according to the small number of his people. In the front he placed the
Archers, of whom he made Captain, John Earl of Oxford: to the right wing of
the battle, he appointed Sir Gilbert Talbor to be the leader: to the left
wing he assigned Sir John Savage, and he with the aid of the Lord Stanley,
accompanied with the Earl of Pembroke, having a good company of horsemen, and
a small number of footmen: For all his whole number exceeded not five thousand
men beside the power of the Stanleys, whereof three thousand were in the field
under the Standard of Sir William Stanley: The Kings number was double as much,
and more.

When both the Armies were thus ordered, and all men ready to set forward King
Richard called his Chieftains together, and to them said: Most faithful and
assured fellows, most trusty and welbeloved friends and elected Captains, by
whose wisdom and policy, I have obtained the Crown and Type of this famous
Realm and noble Region, by whose puissance and valiantness I have enjoyed and
possessed the state Royal and dignity of the same ma^g^e the ill will and
seditious attempts of all my cankerd enemies and insidious adversaries, by
whose prudent and politic counsel I have so governed my Realm, people and
subjects, that I have omitted nothing appertaining to the office of a just
Prince, nor you have pretermitted nothing belonging to the duty of wise and
sage Counselors: So that I may say and truly affirm, that your approved
fidelity and tried constancy, makes me to believe firmly and think, that I
am an undoubted King, and an indubitate Prince. And although in the ad^ption
and obtaining of the Garland, I being seduced and provoked by sinister counsel
and diabolical temptation, did commit a facinorous and detestable act; yet I
have with strict penance and salt tears (as I trust) expiated and clearly
purged the same offense; which abominable crime I require you of friendship as
clearly to forget, as I daily do remember to deplore and lament the same. If
you will now diligently call to remembrance in what case and perplexity we now
stand, and in what doubtful peril we be now intricked, I doubt not but you
in heart will think, and with mouth confess, that if ever amity and faith
prevailed between Prince and subjects, or between subject and subject; or if
ever bond of allegiance obliged the vassaile to love and serve his natural
Sovereign Lord, or if any obligation of duty bound any Prince to aid and
defend his subjects: All these loves, bonds and duties of necessity, are this
day to be experimented, showed and put in experience: For if wise men say true,
there is some policy in getting, but much more in keeping; the one being but
fortunes chance, and the other high wit and policy; for which cause, I with
you, and you with me, must needs this day take labor and pain, to keep and
defend with force, that preeminence and possession, which by your prudent
devises I have gotten and obtained. I doubt not but you know, how the Devil
continual enemy to humane nature, disturber of concord, and sower of sedition,
has entered into the heart of an unknown Welshman (whose father I never knew,
nor him personally saw) exciting him to aspire and covet our Realm, Crown and
Dignity, and thereof clearly to deprive and spoil us and our posterity; ye,
see further, how a company of traitors, thieves, out-lawes and runagates of our
own Nation be aiders and partakers of his feat and enterprise, ready at hand
to overcome and oppress us; you see also, what a number of beggarly Britains
and faint-hearted French men be with him arrived, to destroy us, our wives and
children: which imminent mischiefs and apparent inconveniences, if we will
withstand, we must live together like brethren, fight together like Lions, and
fear not to dye together like men. And observing and keeping this rule and
precept* believe me, the fearful Hare never fled faster before the greedy
Greyhound, nor the silly Lark before the Sparrow hawke, nor the simple Sheep
before the ravenous Wolf, then your proud bragging adversaries astonished and
amazed with the only sight of your manly visages, will fly* run* and skir out
of the Field: For if you consider, and wisely ponder all things in your mind,
you shall perceive that we have manifest causes, and apparent tokens of
Victory. And to begin with the Earl of Richmond, Captain of this rebellion,
he is a Welsh milk-sop, a man of small courage, and of less experience in
Martial acts and feats of war, brought up by my brothers means and mine,
like a captive in a close Cage in the Court of Francis Duke of Britain, and
never saw Army, nor was exercised in Martial affairs, by reason whereof he
neither can nor is able on his own wit and experience to guide an Host. For
in the wit and policy of the Captain, consists the chief adeption of the
victory, and overture of the enemies. Secondly, fear not and put away all
doubts, for when the Traitors and Runagates of our Realm, shall see us with
Banner displayed, come against them, remembering their oath, promise, and
fidelity made unto us, as to their Sovereign Lord and anointed King, they
shall be so pricked and stimulate in the bottom of their scrupulous
consciences, that they for very remorce and dread of the divine plague, will
either shamefully fly, or humbly submit themselves to our grace and mercy. And
as for the Frenchmen and Britains, their valiantness is such, that our Noble
Progenitors and your Noble Parents, have them oftener vanquished and overcome in
one month, then they in the beginning imagined possible to compass and finish
in a whole year. What will you make of them, braggers without audacity,
Drunkards without discretion, rybauds without reason* cowards without
resisting, and in conclusion the most effeminate and lascivious people, that
ever showed themselves in front of Battle, ten times more courageous to fly
and escape, then once to assault the breast of our strong and populous Army?
Wherefore, con^idering all these advantages, expel out of your thoughts all
doubts, and avoid out of your minds all fear, and like valiant Champions
advance forth your Standards, and assay whether your enemies can decide, and
try the title of Battle by dint of Sword: Advance (I say) again forward my
Captains, in whom lacks neither policy, wisdom nor puissance. Every one
give but one sure stripe, and surely the journey is ours. What prevails a
handful to a whole Realm? desiring you for the love that you bear to me,
and the affection that you have to your native and natural country, and to
the safeguard of your Prince and your self, that you will this day take to you
your accustomed courage, and courageous spirits, for the defense and safeguard
of us all And as for me, I assure you, this day I will triumph by glorious
victory, or suffer death for immortal fame. For they be contemned, and out of
the palace of fame degraded, dying without renown, which do not as much
prefer and exalt the perpetual honor of their native Country, as their
own mortal and transitory life. Now Saint George to borrow, let us set
forward, and remember well, that I am he which shall with high advancements*
reward and prefer the valiant and hardy Champions, and punish and torment the
shameful cowards and dreadful dastards.

This exhortation encouraged all such as favored him, but such as were
present, more for dread then love, kissed them openly, whom they inwardly
hated; others swear outwardly to take part with such, whose death they secretly
compassed, and inwardly imagined; others promised to invade the Kings enemies,
which fled and fought with fierce courage against the King; others stood still
and looked on, intending to take part with the victors and overcommers: So was
his people to him unsure and unfaithful at his end, as he was to his Nephews
untrue and unnatural in his beginning.

When the Earl of Richmond knew by his fore-riders, that the King was so near
embattailed, he rode about his Army, from rank to rank, from wing to wing,
giving comfortable words to all men, and that finished (being armed at all
pieces saving his Helmet) mounted on a little hill, so that all his people
might see and behold him perfectly, to their great rejoicing: For he was a man
of no great stature, but so formed and decorated with all gifts and lineaments
of Nature, that he seemed more an angelical creature, then terrestrial
personage; his countenance and aspect was cheerful and courageous, his hair
yellow like burnished Gold, his eyes gray, shining and quick, prompt and ready
in answering, but of such sobriety, that it could never be judged, whether he
were more dull then quick in speaking (such was his temperance) And when he
had over-looked his Army over every side, he paused a while, and after with a
loud voice and bold spirit, spoke to his Companions these or like the words
following:

If ever God gave victory to men fighting in a just quarrel; Or if he ever
aided such as made war for the wealth and tuition of their own natural and
nutritive Country; Or if he ever succored them which adventured their lives
for the relief of innocents, suppressing of malefactors and apparent
offenders; No doubt, my fellows and friends, but he, of his bountiful
goodness, will this day send us triumphant victory, and a lucky journey over
our proud enemies, and arrogant adversaries: For if you remember and consider
the very cause of our just quarre, you shall apparently perceive the same to be
true, Godly and virtuous. In the which I doubt not but God will rather aid us
(yea and fight for us) then see us vanquished and profligate by such as neither
fear him nor his laws, nor yet regard justice or honesty. Our cause is so
just that no enterprise can be of more virtue, both by the laws divine and
civil, for what can be a more honest, goodly, or godly quarrel then to fight
against a captain, being a homicide and murderer of his own blood and
progeny? An extreme destroyer of his nobility, to his and our country and the
poor subjects of the same, a deadly malle, a firebrand and burden untolerable?
besides him, consider who be of his band and company, such as by murder and
untruth committed against their own kindred and linnage, yea against their
Prince and Sovereign Lord, have disherited me and you, and has wrongfully
detained and usurp over lawful patrimony and lineall inheritance. For he that
calls himself* king keeps from me the Crown and regiment of this noble
Realm and Country, contrary to all justice and equity. Likewise, his mates
and friends occupy your lands, cut down your woods and destroy your manors,
letting your wives and children range abroad for their living: which persons
for their penance and punishment I doubt not but God of his goodness will
either deliver into our hands as a great gain and booty, or cause them being
grieved and compuncted with the prick of their corrupt consciences, cowardly
to fly and not abide the battle: besides this I assure you that there be
yonder in that great battle, men brought thither for fear and not for love,
soldiers by force compelled, and not with good will assembled: persons which
desire rather the destruction then the salvation of their master and captain:
and finally a multitude, whereof the most part will be our friends, and the
least part our enemies. For truly I doubt which is greater, the malice of the
soldiers toward their captain, or the fear of him conceived of his people:
for surely this rule is infallible, that as ill men daily covet to destroy the
good, so God appoints the good to confound the ill, and of al worldly goods
the greatest is, to suppress tyrants, and relieve innocents, whereof the one
is ever as much hated as the other is beloved. If this be true (as Clerks
preach) who will spare yonder tyrant Richard Duke of Gloucester untruely
calling himself King, considering that he has violated, and broken both the
law of God and man, what virtue is in him which was the confusion of his
brother, and murtrerer of his nephews? what mercy is in him that flies his
trusty friends as well as his extreme enemies? Who can have confidence in him
which puts diffidence in all men? If you have not read* I have heard Clerks
say, that Tarquin the proud for the vice of the body lost the Kingdom of Rome,
and the name of Tarquin banished from the City for ever: yet was not his fault
so detestable as the fact of cruel Nero, which slew his own mother, and
opened her entralls to behold the place of his conception. Behold yonder
Richard, which is both Tarquin and Nero, yea a tyrant more then Nero, for he
has not only murdered his Nephewe being his King and sovereign Lord,
bastarded his noble brethren, and defamed the womb of his virtuous and womanly
mother, but also compassed all the means and ways that he could invent how
to stuprate and carnally know niece his under the pretense of a cloaked
matrimony, which Lady I have sworn and promised to take and make my wife, as
you all know and believe. If this cause be not just, and this quarrel godly,
let God the giver of victory judge and determine. We have (thanks be given to
Christ) escaped the secret treasons in Britain, and avoided the subtle snares
of our fraudulent enemies there, passed the troublous seas in good and quiet
safeguard, and without resistance have penetrate the ample region and large
country of Wales, and are now come to the place which we so much desired, for
long we have sought the furious Bore, and now we have found him. Wherefore, let
us not fear to enter into the toil where we may surely slay him, for God
knows that we have lived in the vales of misery, tossing our ships in
dangerous storms: let us not now dread to set up our sails in fair weather,
having with us both him and good fortune. If we had come to conquer Wales, and
had achieved it, our praise had been great, and our gain more; but if we
win this battle, the whole Realm of England, with the Lords and Rulers of
the same shall be ours, the profit shall be ours, and the honor shall be ours.
Therefore labor for your gain, and sweat for your right: while we were in
Britain we had small livings and little plenty of wealth or welfare, now is
the time come to get abundance of riches and copy of profit which is the
reward of your service and merit of your pain. And this remember with your
selves, that before us be our Enemies, and on either side of us be such as I
neither surely trust, nor greatly believe, backward we cannot fly: So that
here we stand like sheep in a fold circumsepted and compassed between our
enemies and our doubtful friends. Therefore let all fear be set aside, and
like sworn brethren let us join in one, for this day shall be the end of our
travel, and the gain of our labor, either by honorable death or famous
victory: And as I trust, the battel^ shall not be so sower as the profit shall
be sweet. Remember that victory is not gotten with multitude of men, but with
the courage of hearts and valliantnesse of minds. The smaller that our number
is, the more glory is to us if we vanquish, if we be overcome, yet no laud is
to be attributed, to the victors, considering that ten men fought against
one: and if we die so glorious a death in so good a quarrel, neither fretting
time, nor cancaring oblivion shall be able to obfuscate or race out of the
book of fame either our names or our godly attempt. And this one thing I
assure you, that in so just and good a cause, and so notable a quarrel, you
shall find me this day rather a dead carrion upon the cool ground, then a free
prisoner on a carpit in a Ladies chamber. Let us therefore fight like
invincible giants, and set on our enemies like untimerous Tigers, and banish
all fear like ramping lions. And advance forward true men against traitors,
pitiful persons against murderers* true inheritours against usurpers, the
scourges of God against tyrants, display my banner with a good courage, march
forth like strong and robustious champions, and begin the battle like hardy
conquerors, the battle is at hand, and the victory approaches, and if we
shamefully recoile or cowardly fly, we and all our sequel be destroyed and
dishonored for ever. This is the day of gain, and this is the time of loss,
get this day victory and be conquerors, and leese this days battle and be
villains, and therefore in the name of God let every man courageously advance
forth with his standard.

These cheerful words he set forth with such gesture of body and smiling
countenance, as though already he had vanquished his enemies and gotten the
spoil.

He had scantly finished his saying, but the one army espied the other: Lord
how hastily the soldiers buckled their helmes, how quickly the archers bent
their bows and frushed their feathers, how readily the billmen shook their
bills and prooved their staves, ready to approach and join, when the terrible
trumpet shall sound the bloody blast to victory or death. Between both armies
there was a great marsh which the Earl of Richmond left on his right hand for
this intent, that it should be on that side a defense for his part, and in so
doing he had the sun at his back, and in the faces of his enemies.

When King Richard saw the Earls company was passed the marsh* he commanded
with all have to set upon them, then the T^umpeters blew, and soldiers
shouted, and the Kings archers courageously let fly their arrows; the Earls
bowmen stood not still, but paid them home again. The terrible shot once
past, the armies joined, and came to hand strokes, where neither sword nor bill
was spared, at which encounter the Lord Stanley joined with the Earl. The
Earl of Oxford in the mean season fearing lest while his company was
fighting, they should be compassed and circumvented with the multitude of his
enemies, gave commandment in every rank that no man should be so hardy as to
go above ten foot from the standard, which commandment once known, they
knit themselves together, and ceased a little from fighting: the adversaries
suddenly abashed at the matter* and mistrusting some fraud or deceit, began
also to pause, and left striking, and not against the will. of many which had
rather have had the King destroyed then saved, and therefore they fought very
faintly or stood s^ill. The Earl of Oxford bringing all his band together on
the one part, set on his enemies afresh; again, the adversaries perceiving
that, placed their men slender and thin before, and thick and broad behind,
beginning again hardily the battle. While the two forwards thus mortally
fought, each intending to vanquish and convince the other, King Richard was
admonished by his explorators and espialles, that the Earl of Richmond
accompanied small with a number of men of arms was not far off, and as he
approached and marched toward him, he perfectly knew his personage by certain
demonstrations and tokens which he had learned and known of others. And being
inflamed with ire, and vexed with outrageous malice, he put his spurs to his
horse, and rode out of the side of the range of his Battle, leaving the
avantguards fighting, and like a hungry Lion ran with Spear and rest toward
him. The Earl of Richmond perceived well the King furiously came toward him,
and because the whole hope of his wealth and purpose was to be determined by
Battle, he gladly proffered to encounter with him body to body, and man to
man.

King Richard set on so sharply at the first brunt, that he overthrew the
Earls Standard, and slew Sir William Brandon his Standard Bearer (which was
Father to Sir Charles Brandon, by King Henry the 8. created Duke of Suffolk)
and matched hand to hand with Sir John Cheiny, a man of great force and
strength which would have resisted him, and the said John was by him manfully
overthrown, and so he making open passage by dent of sword as he went
forward, the Earl of Richmond withstood his violence and kept him at the
swords point without advantage, longer then his companions either thought or
judged, which being almost in despair of Victory, were suddenly recomforted by
Sir William Stanley, which came to succor them with three thousand tall men,
at which very instant King Richards men were driven back and fled, and he
himself manfully fighting in the middle of his enemies, was slain and brought
to his death as he worthily had deserved.

In the mean season the Earl of Oxford, with the aid of the Lord Stanley,
after no long fight discom^ted the forward of King Richard, whereof a great
number were slain in the flight, but the greatest number which (compelled by
fear of the King, and not of their mere valiant motion) came to the field,
gave never a stroke, and having no harm nor damage, safely departed, which
came not thither in hope to see the King prosper and prevail, but to hear that
he should be shamefully confounded and brought to ruin.

In this Battle dyed few above the number of a thousand persons: And of the
Nobility were slain John Duke of Norfolk, which was warned by diverse to
refrain the Field, insomuch that the night before he should set forward
toward the King, one wrote on his Gate: Jack of Norfolk be not too bold,
For Dickon thy Master is bought and sold.


Yet all this notwithstanding, he regarding more his oath, his honor and
promise made to King Richard, like a Gentleman and a faithful subject to his
Prince, absented not himself from his Master, but as he faithfully lived
under him, so he manfully dyed with him, to his great fame and laud. The^e
were slain beside him Walter Lord Ferrers of Chartley, Sir Richard Rad^liffe,
and Robert Braken^u^y Lieutenant of the Tower, and not many Gentlemen more. Sir
William Catesbey learned in the Laws of the Realm, and one of the chief
Counselors to the late King, with diverse others, were two days after beheaded
at Leicester. Amongst them that ran away, were Sir Francis Vicount Lovell,
and Humfrey Stafford, and Thomas Stafford his Brother, which took Sanctuary at
Saint John's at Gloucester. Of Captives and prisoners there was a great number
for after the death of King Richard was known and published, every man in
manner vnarming himself, and casting away his abiliment of war, meekly
submitted themselves to the obeisance and rule of the Earl of Richmond: of the
which the more part had gladly so done in the beginning, if they might have
conveniently escaped from King Richards espyals, which having as clear eyes as
Linx, and as open ears as Midas, ranged and searched in every quarter. Amongst
these was Henry the fourth Earl of Northumberland, which whether it was by the
commandment of King Richard putting diffidence in him, or he did it for the
love and favor that he bare unto the Earl, stood still with a great company
and intermitted not in the battle, which was incontinently received into
favor and made of the council. But Thomas Howard Earl of Surrey, which
submitted himself there, was not taken to grace, because his Father was chief
Counceller, and he ly familiar with with King Richard, but committed to the
Tower of London, where he long remained, and in conclusion delivered, and for
his truth and fidelity after promoted to high honors and dignities. On the
Earl of Richmonds part were slain scarce one hundred persons, amongst whom
the principal was sir William Brandon his standard bearer.

This battle was fought at at Bosworth in Leicestershire, the two and
twentieth day of August, in the year one thousand four hundred eighty six;
the whole conflict endured little above two hours. King Richard, as the fame
went, might have escaped and gotten safeguard by flying. For when they which
were next about his person saw and perceived at the first joining of the
battle, the soldiers faintly and nothing courageously to set on their
enemies, and not only that, but also that some with drew themselves privily
out of the prease and departed; They began to suspect fraud, and smell
treason, and not only exhorted, but determinately advised him to save himself
by flight: and when the loss of the battle was eminent and apparent, they
brought to him a swift and a light horse to convey him away. He which was not
ignorant of the grudge and ill will that the common people bare toward him,
casting away all hope of fortunate success and happy chance to come, answered
(as men say) he would make an end of all battles, or else there finish his
life. Such a great audacitie and such a stout stomach reigned in his body; for
surely he knew that to be the day in the which it should be decided and
determined, whether he should peaceably obtain and enjoy his kingdom during
his life, or else utterly forgo and be deprived of the same, with which too
much hardiness he being overcome, hastily closed his helmet, and entered
fiercely into the hard battle, to the intent to obtain that day a quiet
reign, or else to finish there his unquiet life and unfortunate governance.
And so this miser at the same very point had like chance and fortune, as
happens to such which in place of right justice and honesty following their
sensual appetite, love, use, and embrace mischief, tyranny, and
unthriftinesse. Surely these be examples of more vehemence then man's tongue can
express* to fear and astunne such evil persons as will not live one hour
vacant from doing and exercising cruelty, mischief or outrageous living.

When the Earl had thus obtained victory, and slain his mortal enemy, he
kneeled down and rendered to almighty God his hearty thanks with devout and
godly orisons, beseeching his goodness to send him grace to advance and defend
the catholic faith, and to maintain justice and concord amongst his subjects
and people, by God now to his governance committed and assigned: which prayer
finished, he replenished with incomparable gladness, ascended up to the top of
a little mountain, where he not only praised an^ ^^^ded his valiant
soldiers, but also gave unto them his hearty thanks, with promise of condign
recompense for their fidelity and valiant facts, willing and commanding all
the hurt and wounded persons to be cured and the dead carcases to be
delivered to the Sepulture.

Then the people rejoiced and clapped hands, crying up to heaven, King Henry,
King Henry. When the Lord Stanley saw the good will and gratuity of the people
he took the Crown of King Richard which was found amongst the spoil in the
field, and set it on the Earls head, as though he had been elected King by
the voice of the people as in ancient times past in diverse Realms it has
been accustomed, and this was the first sign and token of his good luck and
felicity. I must put you here in remembrance, how that King Richard putting
some diffidence in the Lord Stanley, which had with him as an hostage, the Lord
Strange his eldest son, which Lord Stanley as you have heard before joined
not at the first with his son in laws army, for fear that King Richard
would have slain the Lord Strange his heir. When King Richard was come to
Bosworth, he sent a pursevant to the Lord Stanley, commanding him to advance
forward with his company, and to come to his presence; which thing if he
refused to do, he swore by Christ's passion that he would strike off his
sons head before he dined.

The Lord Stanley answered the Pursevant, that if the King did so, he had more
sons alive, and to come to him he was not then so determined: when King Richard
heard this answer he commanded the Lord Strange incontinent to be beheaded,
which was at that very same season when both the armies had ^ight each of the
other. The Counselors of King Richard pondering the time and the cause,
knowing also the Lord Strange to be innocent of his fathers offense, persuaded
the King that it was now time to fight* and not time to execution, advising him
to keep the Lord Strange as a prisoner till the battle was ended, and then at
leisure his pleasure might be accomplished. So as God would King Richard
infringed his holy oath, and the Lord was ^elivered (...) the keepers of the
Kings ten^ to be kept as a prisoner, which when the field was done, and their
master slain, and proclamation made to know where the child was, they
submitted themselves as prisoners to the Lord Strange, and he gently received
them and brought them to the new proclaimed King, where of him and of his father
he was received with great joy and gladness.

After this the whole camp removed with bag and baggage, and the same night in
the evening King Henry with great pomp came to the town of Leicester. Where
as well for the refreshing of his people and soldiers, as for preparing all
things necessary for his journey toward London, he rested and reposed himself
two days. In the mean season the dead corpse of King Richard was as
shamefully* carried to the town of Leicester, as he gorgiously the day before
with pomp and pride departed out of the same town. For his body was naked and
despoyled to the skin, and nothing left about him, not so much as a clout to
cover his privy members, and was trussed behind a pursevant of arms called
Blaunche Senglier or white Boar, like a hog or a calfe, the head and arms
hanging on the one side of the horse, and the legs on the other side, and all
besprinkled with mire and blood, was brought to the Gray Friars Church within
the town, and there laid like a miserable spectacle: but surely considering
his mischievous acts and Facinorous doings, men may worthily wonder at such a
caitive, and in the said Church he was with no less funeral pomp and
solemnity interred, then he would to be done at the burying of his innocent
Nephews, whom he caused cruelly to be murdered and unnaturally to be
quelled.

When his death was known, few lamented, and many rejoiced, the proud bragging
white Boar (which was his badge) was violently rased and plucked down from
every sign and place where it might be espied, so ill was his life that men
wished the memory of him to be buried with his carren corpse: He reigned two
years, two months, and one day.

As he was small and little of stature, so was he of body greatly deformed, the
one shoulder higher then the other, his face small, but his countenance was
cruel, and such, that a man at the first aspect would judge it to savor and
smell of malice, fraud, and deceit: when he stood musing he would bite and
chew beasly his nether lip, as who said, that his fierce nature in his cruel
body always chafed, stirred, and was ever unquiet: besides that, the dagger
that he wore, he would when he studied with his hand pluck up and down in
the sheath to the midst, never drawing it fully out; his wit was pregnant,
quick and ready, will to ^iegne and apt to dissemble, he had a proud mind,
and an arrogant stomach, the which accompanied him to his death, which he
rather desiring to suffer by dent of sword, then being forsaken and destitute
of his untrue companions, would by coward flight preserve and save his
uncertain life: Which by malice, sickness, or condign punishment ^ight
chan^e shortly after to come to confusion.

Thus ended this Prince his mortal life with infamy and dishonor, which
never preferred fame or honesty before ambition, tyranny, and mischief. And if
he had continued still Protector, and suffered his Nephews to have lived and
reigned, no doubt but the Realm had prospered, and he much praised and
beloved as he is now abhorred and vilipended, but to God which knew his
interior cogitations at the hour of his death I commit the punishment of his
offenses committed in his life.

FINIS.
