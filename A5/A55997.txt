PROLOGUE TO THE REVIVED ALCHEMIST.
THE Alchemist; Fire, breeding Gold, our Theme:
Here must no Melancholy be, nor Phlegm.
Young Ben, not Old, writ this, when in his Prime,
Solid in Judgment, and in Wit sublime.
The Sisters, who at Thespian Springs their Blood
Cool with fresh Streams, All, in a Merry Mood,
Their watery Cups, and Pittances declined,
At Bread-street's Mer-maid with our Poet dined:
Where, what they Drank, or who played most the Rig,
Fame modestly conceals: but He grew big
Of this pris'd Issue; when a Jovial Maid,
His Brows besprinkling with Canarie, said.
Pregnant by Us, produce no Mortal Birth;
Thy active Soul, quitting the sordid Earth,
Shall among Heavens glittering Hieroglyphics trade,
And Pegasus, our winged Sumpter, jade,
Who from Parnassus never brought to Greece,
Nor Roman Stage, so rare a Masterpiece.
This Story, true or false, may well be spared;
The Actors are in question, not the Bard:
How they shall humor their oft-varied Parts,
To get your Money, Company, and Hearts,
Since all Tradition, and like Helps are lost.
Reading our Bill new pasted on the Post,
Grave Stagers both, one, to the other said,
The ALCHEMIST? What! are the Fellows mad?
Who shall Doll Common Act? Their tender Tibs
Have neither Lungs, nor Confidence, nor Ribs.
Who Face, and Subtle? Parts, all Air, and Fire:
They, whom the Author did Himself inspire,
Taught, Line by Line, each Tittle, Accent, Word,
Never reached His Height; all after, more absurd,
Shadows of fainter Shadows, wheresoever
A Fox he pencil'd, copied out a Bear.
Encouragement for young Beginners small:
Yet howsoever we'll venture; have at All.
Bold Ignorance (they say) falls seldom short
In Camp, the Country, City, or the Court.
Armed with the Influence of your fair Aspects,
Our Selves we'll conquer, and our own Defects.
A thousand Eyes dart rays into our Hearts,
Would make Stones speak, and Stocks play well their Parts:
Some few Malignant Beams we need not fear,
Where shines such Glory in so bright a Sphere.
