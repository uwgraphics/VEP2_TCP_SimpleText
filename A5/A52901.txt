The New Catholic Ballad.
To the Tune of Chivy-chace.
GOOD People all to me give ear,
And mark my Story well,
For such sad things were never heard
As I to you shall tell:
The Catholics in England have
Of late so standered been.
And Slaughtered too, that I believe
The like was never seen:
For they are standered with the truth,
Of which the world does ring,
And have been justly slaughtered too,
A sad, and dismal thing.
You know their Ancestors did plot
To kill Elizabeth,
And blow up James, and by their means
Good Charles was put to death.
But if they should deny that they
This Murder did contrive,
If I don't prove it then let them
Me of my life deprive:
For the Queen Mother's Confessor,
Aposlate Gough by name,
One of the Rebels Troopers was
(To Papists no small shame.)
And when the fatal stroke, was struck
Aloud he JUSTICE cried
And then, with his drawn Sword, amongst
The People he did ride.
Du Moulin's Book this Murder too
Does on the Papists charge,
And faith if they dare question him
He Will prove it more at large.
Nor since our Gracious King's return
Have Papists idle been,
But in their Father's steps have trod,
And showed their malice keen:
For they these one and twenty years
Against him have conspired,
And all true English Protestants,
And London they have fired.
But he that faith there was no Plot,
Nor is, can be no friend
To truth, or King, or Parliaments
(What ere he may pretend:)
Nay he is a Traitor, and I will
Show you the Reason why,
Because he does in down right terms
Give to the King the Lie.
And likewise to four Parliaments,
To Judges, Truth, and Laws,
(Which shows the loyalty of such
As plead the Romish Cause)
For diverse Proclamations,
And Speeches of the King,
Bo^^ Houses Votes, and Judges sense
Have clearly proved the thing.
Yet still they are so impudent,
As by their Traiterous Tools,
To justify their innocence
When ere they meet with Fools.
But they at last have fooled themselves,
And their own Plot betrayed;
And so are taken in the Snare,
Which they for us had laid:
For they on Protestants have forged
Such pitiful Sham-Plots,
That they have proved their own thereby,
And Showed themselves mere Sots;
So that the simplest Protestants
Do now most plainly see
That Papists, Traitors, Murderers
And perjured Villains be.
But wonder not to hear, or read
Their wicked treacherous tricks;
For they are taught they should not keep
Their Faith with Heretics;
Nay that the greatest sins, against
Divine and Humane Laws,
Are none, but meritorious acts,
If done to advance their Cause.
Hence we may learn what to expect
From such false bloody Knaves;
If they prevail we must be slain,
Or Beggars live, and Slaves:
Therefore good Lord preserve our King,
And grant him long to Reign,
That into England Popery
May never be brought again.
FINIS.
