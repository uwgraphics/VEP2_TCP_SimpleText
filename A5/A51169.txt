AN ANTIDOTE AGAINST The error in opinion of many in these days concerning
some of the highest and chief Duties of Religion: AS Adoration, Alms,
Fasting, and Prayer.

1 Thessal. 5.21. Prove all things, hold fast that which is good. 1 Esdras
4.38. As for the tuth it endures, and is always strong, it lives and
conquereth for ever. LONDON, Printed by E. Griffin. 1647.

TO THE Right Honorable, and most worthy of all Honor,
My Honored Lord,
TO say nothing of your Virtues, nor my obligations, (which indeed the highest
and best Language would rather derogate from, then any ways express.) In
obedience to your commands, that as a Law must ever regulate my actions, I here
present you from the Press with what you have already seen in loose Papers;
yet so as I have not presumed to pass it under your name; because denying it
the subscription of my own, and too unworthy of such a Dedication; though
truly you could not blame me, had I offended in both, since I only give the
mettle, you the stamp that sends it abroad for good and current; so as you owe
me pardon and vindication if it shall reflect upon either, since I resign both
my own will and judgment to yours, and become rather passive then active in
publishing these indigested thoughts, being in all things resolved to express
my self

Your Lordships in all affection to be disposed of.

To the Reader.
Gentle Reader,
I Have observed a double error amongst the men of these times in the too long
reteining, or too forward anticipation of their thoughts. For some phlegmatic
and melancholy constitutions, like rich Mines, keeping their Oar within
themselves, ever carry their Candle in a dark Lantern to see their own way
by, not to guide others; or are weaving a garment all their lives to wear
only to their graves. When others to the contrary, of more sanguine and fiery
natures, like the Israellivish women, are for war in their births, and so they
may be delivered but of a little vainglory, flattery, envy, engagement of
opinion, or the like, never consider how abortive and misshapen an issue they
bring into the world, formed rather out of the foame of the brain then any
solid matter. But I desire to avoid both extremes, and would neither be the
Box of Ointment that holds all within and poures out nothing, nor the leaking
vessel that is ever emptying it self of what it receives, though never so
offensive and nauseous. For as I profess against the thinking of any thing
that comes from me worthy a public owning, so I decline not the satisfaction
of some near friends, that have engaged me to expose this short account of
some of my private meditations to the severity of others opinions. Though I am
not unsensible of the prejudicate prejudice they will meet with abroad; since I
see truth self in many things of the nature insulted upon, an^ cried against,
as Christ w^ amongst the Jews, not Bara^bas but Jesus; not errour^ but
innocence must be the S^crifice and suffer for the people. Yet under this
contempt and annihilation (like our S^viour upon the Cross) it is i^ greatest
triumph because n^ conquered, when crucified, and will rise again more
gloriou^ for being now buried so lo^ in infamy and disgrace. An^ if I can but
contribute the Glow-wormes shine, or lea^ twylight to its manifestation ^n
these benighted times of ignorance (wherein we are become blind by seeing too
much of our new pretended Light, when the great Luminaries of our Church have
either withdrawn their influence, or been cast out of their Orb) I shall truly
rejoice, and willingly bear their censure that have not charity to pardon my
failings; since in that affection I am the same to all, we ought to maintain
to one another, and could wish my self a Sacrifice for their good, and the
Churches prosperity.

Of Adoration.
THough God as He is I am, a perfect and single being of Himself, all
goodness, the Spring and Fountain out of which all other beings and
perfections flow, might have enjoyed an eternal complacence, felicity, and
happiness, in Himself; altogether incapable of Accession or Diminution: yet
for the fuller manifestation of Himself in the Attributes of his Power, Me^cy,
Justice, and the like; h^ made the goodly frame of the whole Universe, and
place man at the foot of the account as his last and greatest work^ of
Creation, to sum up an^ recapitulate the several beings and perfections of
all the rest. Though he imprinte^ upon every one some visib^ footsteps of an
invisible Deity making every creature like so many several Character some
greater, some less, b^ their orderly being put together, as Letters in the
Pres^^ to spell his name Jehovah to (...) from a most legible hand; (...) Name
not known to Abraham Isaac, and Jacob, Exodus 6. as (...) imports the Eternity
of h^ Essence, who was yesterday, (...) day, and the same for ever; pas^
present, and to come, with the ^^istence and perfection of all ^^ings in him.
So as with Saint ^^rnard we may fay, God is ^^e being of all other crea^^res;
as they are of Him, and (...) Him, and from Him: not (...) at they are the same
with ^^irn, or that He is. A Name of ^^eer sounds (litterae quiescen^^t) and of
that immoderate ^^verence amongst the Jews ^s one observes) that it was ever
named but once a year, ^id that by the high Priest; ^^d being compounded of
^ur Letters, (as some specu^tive men collect) did myste^ously express the
three Persons in the one Godhead to ^s, and Incarnation of His ^onne. The
first, signifying ^ower for God the Father, ^e second Wisdom for God the
Son, the third Love f^^ God the Holy Ghost; (...) fourth a repitition of the
^^cond, to show the reconciliation of two natures in the Person of Christ:
Altogether to declare Gods awful an^ stupendous Majesty, his Protection in
supporting, Prov^dence in guiding, Tendernes^ and compassion in caring for man,
to whose nature he was united; and by it to challenge all the returns of
gratitude service and honor, our souled and bodies are capable of producing,
as the end of our creating. For God made all thing for the use and service of
man^ giving him the sole Monarch^ over the creatures; and man for his own glory
only, re^serving to Himself a sing^ propriety in him. So that, (...) would be
the greatest sacri^dge in the world to rob God ^f any part, since He has from
^l eternity consecrated the ^hole man to his service. And therefore it is not
enough to ^ive Him inward fear without ^utward reverence, nor a par^all, but
an universal obedi^nce, hand and heart, soul and ^ody, with all the members
and faculties of both, concurring in all acts of his worship in their several
expressions of ^eale, piety, and devotion. and not make it our Religion ^o be
irroligious; nor with many in these times, account a ^zy, proud, affected
negli^ence, the best posture to serve ^od in. For surely though the ^ody may
act the Hypocrite, ^a fair flower appear upon a ^ithered stalk) and
personate devotion without the soule^ the soul can never praise Go^ as it
should, but the body wi^ bear its part in the Harmony and (so far as place
and other circumstances allow it) will make it all without as well a^ all
within, Psalm. 10.3.
Psalm. 10.3. praise the Lord in the most awful, reverentiall, humble, and
decen^ posture it can compose it self to, ever shaping its behavior by what
opinion and the cu^stome of the place account most expressive of inward
devotion, and outward submission, even such as in civil u^ servants use to pay
their masters, Subjects their Kings, t^ humble humility it self (the more to
speak Gods glory) (...) it were possible in these unaccented inarticulate yet
lou^ voices. Though, as the soun^ b^ the touch of the string, the ^nne by its
operations, the ^tificer by the building he ^ses, the temper of the body (...)
the Pulse; all these out^rd expressions should pro^ed from, and declare inward
^bits, our corporal actions ^m our true mental piety, as ^e echo from the
voice that ^mes it. For the Adoration (...) the body is but the body of
^doration, the devotion of the ^ule the soul of devotion, that it animates and
actuates (...) the rest; even the whole man (...) the manifestation of Gods
^ory, knowing the most Hea^nly Anthemes and best Har^ony arises from all parts
in insort together. Nay indeed is but a maimed and ble^shed Sacrifice, (which
is to ^ophane Gods Altar) if we leave any part behind, a^^ bring not the whole
man (...) him, our bodies as well (...) souls; since both with Sai^^ Paul will
but make up our re^sonable service, in that we abought with a price, (purchase
His by emption and redemption) for that end, Romans 12.
Romans 12. A^^ if the heart, the Primum mob^^ be his, it will carry all the i^^
feriour ones with it, The ey^^ to look up unto the hills fro^^ whenee comes
our salvatio^^ the hands elevated for an evening sacrifice, the knees bow^^ in
an humble sense of o^^ nothingnesse, and Gods omnipotence, His Majesty a^^ our
vileness, with a casti^^ down the whole man in (...) dreadful reverence of
his a^^ full and glorious presence (...) his Ordinances. This outwa^^
comportment ever should follow true inward piety, as the ^^adow the body. Nor
can ^^igh elevated and Spiritual ^bjects be known to us, or ^^ade legible, but
in their effects; nay, there are no other perspectives for dim nature ^o see
the glimering of Gods ^lory in them by the incarnation of Himself in his
works, ^or can he otherwise (quoad ^os) reveal himself then ad extra. How
then can we weak ^^en think to bring glory to ^od from our works ad intra,
speak his praises in a lisping ^alfe-worded Language, without a vocal and
operative one? when the true counterpart and ^ost unerring copy of the ^oules
affections is the bodies actions.

Nor do I in this contend for corporal worship, as (...) ceremony (a thing of
decency and fitness, or arbitrary only but as a moral duty, and o^ of the
highest parts of God worship; if we consider it b^ its contrary, the
grievousness of the sin of Idolatry, an^ the severe punishments due t^ it,
the manner of serving Go^ being the next Commanded meant to that of having a Go^
to serve, and a devotion mo^ free from all selfe-reflections in its
performance, in that (...) brings nothing to man bu^ shame (when he covers
himself with confusion as a Garment to give the more glory to God) whereas in
prayer and many other acts of devotion, we do not divest ourselves of self
interest, bu^ with the good Husbandman plough and sow in hope of a ^ich harvest
and blessed return. And it were a shame to Christians to be ignorant of this,
when the very Heathen by the twilight of nature, that knew ^ot the true God,
did ever worship their false ones in those postures that in their use and
acceptance were most expressive of reverence and humility. And not far to
exceed them as well in the semplances as realities of piety, by animating and
spiritualizing, ^s it were, this bodily work, (or rather work of the body) ^o
make it become a spiritual Sacrifice to God, as well as Fasting, Alms, and
the like, Heb. 13. which yet are only so considered in their spring and first
issue, (the spirit working by corporeal Organs and instruments, and the^^
Ocean into which they runn^^ all terminating in Gods glory. For in holy duties
Finis d^^ formam, and adds truth t^^ the Spirit, manifests and de^^ clares
that we worship in spirit and truth, John 4.
John 4. the corporeal act taking its impression from the Spirit, sealing an^
ratifying the dictates of the soul, turning the man outward, and making that
see^ which is invisible. But to b^ more clear we will define the duty thus:

Adoration is an act of devotion terminated in God, as the only object in
which soul and body should concur i^ their several operations and ways of
expressing of their awful, pious, and reverentiall apprehension of his Essence
^^d Attributes, and humble ^^proaches to so dreadful a ^^jesty. Now this
religious ^^rship (which Scotus in lib 3. ^^t. 9. calls Piet as vel Dei cultus)
^^dilectione, Sacrificii exhibi^^ne, atque reverentia consistit, says he) and
is a moral ^^rtue properly referred to ^^stice, as performing to God ^^ribute
only due to the Su^^eame first and chief Good, ^^luding three acts in it.

1. Actum mentis, quo appre^ndimus Personae honoratae ex^^llentiam. 2. Actum
voluntatis, quo nos ^^i ut inferiores submittimus, and ^^ debitis officiis
agnoscere prom^^i sumus. 3. Actum corporis, quo signum ^^strae Demissionis
ostendimus, ^^ostratione, inclinatione Capitis ^^dgeniculatione, and similibus.
And therefore the School men say, As temperance (...) good, in ordine ad se
ipsum Justice, in ordine ad proximum so Religion (which is Pietat^ vinculum) in
ordine ad Deum and is to show it self in Adoration as one of the high^^ duties
of piety, from the consideration of the infinitely ra^sed excellency God has
(...) himself, as Author bot^ of our Creation and Beatification; and this in
the mo^^ full way of manifestation th^^ whole man is capable of performing. So
Damascen, and The Aquin. qu. 84. infer. Qu^^ duplici natura compositi sumu^
intellectuali scilicet and sensibi^ Duplicem adorationem Deo off^ rimus,
Spiritualem quae consist^ in interiori mentis Devotion^ and corporalem; and in
omnib^^ actibus id quod est exterius, re^^rtur ad id quod interius, ut per
^^gna humilitatis quae corporali^^ exhibemus, excitetur noster ^^fectus in
subjiciendum se Deo. ^ut as motion from life, ex ^irituali Devotione procedit,
and ^^ eam ordinatur, The soul ^ust be the Alpha, and God ^^e Omega of it,
which we may ^metime illustrate by a simi^ude.

For as prayer is first in the understanding, and then in ^^ords as its image,
reflection, ^^d interpreter: So Adoration must be first in the inward ^^an (as
the child quickened in ^^e womb) and then it will ^^ in the throws and pain
till ^^be brought forth into action. ^^n humble soul (if truly and ^owingly
pious) never inhabiting but in a lowly body; for Adoration being first s^^ted
in the understanding fr^^ the apprehension of God (...) the primative and
chief goo^ and then in our wills submi^ting our selves to him with (...)
reverence and devotion, f^^ conveying some of that goo^nesse to us; in giving
us n^^ only a being, but the best (...) beings here, with title to (...)
eternal one hereafter, w^^ show it self in some stamp upon the Wax in the
corp^reall acts of Incurvation, Pr^stration, and Genuflections, i^terpretative.
And good reason, since we cannot by sen^^ (Attingere Deum) lay hold (...) God,
we should by sensib^^ signs stir up our selves (...) seek Him, and publish
o^^ reverentiall fear in this Ou^ rent of humility toward ou^ Maker, and
teach others by ^e shorter and compulsory ^ay of example, Gal. 2.14. ^ give
glory to God on high ^y falling before his footstool ^re below, Ps. 95.2, 11,
27, 29.2. ^eb. 12.28. Micah 6.6. Yet we ^ust not conceive the acts of ^e body
to be simply religious (...) themselves, but become such ^nely (intention
agentis) by the ^tention of the doer, from all which we will raise some short
conclusions bottoming them upon the surest foundation, Gods holy Word.

First, Adoration, or any ^utward act of expression, which by Divine
institution, ^r its own signification ought ^o be referred to God, is Idola^y
if exhibited to any creature in a religious way; Though (...) civil worship or
reverence of subjection is due to other in regard of some particular eminency
and dominion giv^ to them from God; and (...) they are a shadow, a dark
picture, or dim charact^ drawn in little of that original greatness which is
in God, (...) Him as in the fountain, (...) them as in the streams,
deriv^tive, weak and imperfect. A^^ thus S. Augustine ( lib. 22. cont^^
Faustum, and de vera Religion cap. 55. says we may honor the Angels in these
respects Charitate, not Servitute, 1 Co^. 11.10. Col. 2. Rev. 19. And (...) may
worship the Martyrs (...) we would men in this life, wi^^ a reverence of love
and Soci^ty, or we may honor the^^ by imitation, not in our dev^tion.

Secondly, self (so jealous is God of this (...) of his honor) Inadorabi^^^st
ut creatura, si dividas sub^us intelligentiis quod vide^^ ab eo quod
intelligitur, is not ^^^e adored if considered in (...) humanity alone; yet
ado^^^us verbum cum carne, id est ^^^ens carnem sibi unitam, is to ^^^dored as
consisting of two ^^^ures, which by personal ^^^hypostaticall union make (...)
one person, the humane ^^^ure only existing in the ^^^ine, who took the
nature ^^^ly, not the person of man. ^^^d upon this ground say the schoolmen,
Non debet excludi ^^^nino adorationis Caro, licet (...) non sit ratio adorandi,
it ^^y be performed sensu com^^^to non diviso, in the concrete (...) abstracted
sense, Isa. 45.14, (...) Psalm. 2.10. Matthew. 28.9, 15. and was so practiced and
prophesied on, Matthew. 8.2, 9, (...) 15, 25. Psalm. 45.11, 72, 9, 11.

Thirdly, Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. 4.
Exodus 20. Deuteronomy. And that the Gloss obser^^ is expressed in two wor^^ bowing
down and worshippi^^ that as Adorare consistit in (...) exteriori vel effectu,
Colere (...) in affectu vel actu interiori, (...) might contribute all our
po^ers, both notions and moti^^ to the advancement of G^^ service and glory.
Nor is (...) duty only founded in the ^^gative precept upon wh^ Daniel the
third is a large (...) raphrase, but enjoined u^^ the first Commandment b^^ by
Moses interpretation, D^^ 4.6. and our Saviors C^^ m^nt Matthew. 4. which is
affirmative to God, but exclusive (...) all other creatures, and ^^its not the
use of Images, (...) any other representation, ^^citative nor objective as a
^^tive to, or termination of (...) worship in the acts of it, ^^ough the
Schoolmen by ^^t distinction have turned (...) peoples devotions into ^^latry
and superstition) least ^^uction follow as a punishment upon our disobedience
^^d rebellion, Heb. 2.18, 20. (...). 40.18.

Fourthly, that Adoration ^^s not only commanded in ^^e Law, and often
repeated (...) the Gospel, Matthew. 4. Heb. 12.28 Rev. 15.4, 19, 10, 22, 9.
but pro^^esied on under such a phrase (...) comprehends and signifies (...)
whole worship of God Zeph. 2.11. Isa. 45.23. Psa. 2.3, 11 22, 27, 72, 11.
, (...) that it did always accompany Gods worship both (...) public, for the
giving glo^^^ to God, and good example^^^ men 1 Samuel 1.19. Nehe. 8.6. 2 Samuel
12.20. Ier. 7.2. 2 Chro. 20 18. 29.28, 30, 32, 12. Exodus 34.8 Deuteronomy. 26.10 John
4. Psalm 5.7.22.27.29, 1, 2, 45.11.86.9.66.4.95, 96, 97.7.132, 138
; and used as an abridgement and sum of all other duties and devotions by
(...) Jews; for when some pression and extraordinary occasion would not allow
them ti^^ for more, they only went^ the Temple, worshipped, a^^ departed, as
some of th^^ ancient Rabbis affirm. A^^ if they did not worship wi^^ out
praying, they never I (...) sure prayed without worshipping, but in that strove
(...) give him the glory due unto (...) Name Psalm. 29.1, 2. Deuteronomy. 6.10 Jerc.
26.2. Za h 14.16 17. Acts 8 27.24.10. 1 Cor. 6.20.
; and the Church^ due reverence Lev. 19.30. 2^.
: in rega^^ of Gods more efficacious a^^ glorious presence there Mat. 18.20.
Psalm. 27.48.9.26.2.105.4.2 Chro. 7. Pro. 34. 1 Kings 8.
and the service and attendance (...) the holy Angels to protect ^^d guard us,
1 Cor. 11.10. Heb. (...) 5. Psalm 34.7. Micah 6.6. ^^e. 5.1.

Fifthly, that as Adoration was ^^^waies accounted a part of ^^^ds public
worship, so it ^^^s ever practiced with most ^^^erty in the private devoti^^^
of Gods servants; to evidence to themselves the inte^^^ty, zeal, humility, and
affections of their own souls, and (...) the actions of the body to ^^^rre up
their devotions Dan. 6.10 Luke 22.41
, ^^^d to show that being but ^^^st and ashes (which was A^^^hams Prologue to
his prayer ^^^n. 18.17.) they would yet ^^^th David become more vile (...) God,
2 Samuel 6.20, 21.

Sixthly, that Adoration is (...) ceremony we may collect from those
expressions t^^ very Saints and Angels in He^ven use in their devotions Rev.
7.11 12.22, 5, 14.
but a moral and perpetu^^ duty, one of the essentials (...) true piety, and
to continue beyond the measure of time (...) self, until, at, and after the
day of judgment in the glo^^ of the Saints, where no cer^mony is, Rev. 13.7.
4.10.1^^ 5, 14, 11, 16, 17.

Seventhly, that Adorati^^ has not only precept for (...) foundation, but for
its suppo^^ the practice of all holy m^^ upon earth, Divisim and conju^^ctim,
single, or as particul^^ men multiplied into a congregation both in private a^^
public devotion Acts 20.36, 21, 5. Mat. 28.9, 17, 15, 25. Exodus 34 8. 2 Samuel
12.20. 1 Kings 1.47, (...) 2 Chro. 7.3. 20.18, 29.20. Esth. 10.1. Neh. 8.6.
Jo^^ 20. Exodus 33.10.
; N^^ Christ however in other things ^umbled, in this did humble himself Luke
24.41. Mat. 26.39
. And if God did ^his for man, shall not weak ^^an put the greatest debasement
upon himself to exalt ^is great God? Nor does John (...). 20. forbid it, but
requires ^he spirit as the chief ingredient in it, verse 23. and both as ^n
effect and high end of Gods Word preached, 1 Cor. 14.25. Matthew. 2.

But some may object that his was reproved in Josh. 7.10. and a contrary
practice mentioned in David, 2 Samuel 7.18.

To which I answer, that ^^shua in his holy consternation and prostration of
himself, was not checked for the act, ^ut the excess in it perhaps, or other
for not endeavoring ^^st to find the sin, the cause of punishment before
the remedy; the soar, before (...) applied the plaster. A^^ for that where
David is said (...) sit at prayer, we must tak^ notice that the same word
(...) the original (as some learn^^ men observe) from Genesis 27.4^^ Levit. 14.8.
1 Samuel 1.22. 20.1^ 2 Samuel 19.32. compared wit^ 2 Samuel 7.18. that in all the^
places the same word is use^ in the original tongue, and (...) not to be
understood of the gesture of sitting, but the continuing in a posture of praye^
As David in the like case is sai^ to remain before the Lord From all this
result cleare^ arises, that such gestures (...) most express a reverentia^^
fea^e, were commanded (...) God as a moral duty practice by his Saints, and
are to (...) imitated by us in our addresses and approaches to God, so far as
convenience of place, age, or infirmities will permit. And if we cannot kneel
nor fall down, which is a posture in these times fit rather for the freedom of
a private retirement then our public devotions, to avoid spiritual pride
which often grows and springs out of an affected humility, and the too forward
censures of others, let us prefer Mercy before Sacrifice in this even to our
selves, Matthew. 12.7. for God will allow it, if we offer all in our power, even
standing in prayer where we have no room nor power to kneel Neh. 9.2, 5. Luke
18.13
: And where we can do neither, with old and weak Jacob, let us worship in such
corporal expressions as we can arrive at Genesis 47.31. Hab. 11.
; yet i^ a Minister kneeling even i^ prayer is sometimes dispensa^ble, when
standing in the Pul^ pit will make his voice the more audible and diffusive o^
Gods Word, and tends mo^^ to edification 1 Cor. 14 17.
; for thoug^^ the obligation thereunto bind^^ semper, it does not ad semper^^
always in the habit, not i^ the act, as in the comman^ of honoring our
parents still in disposition, not i^ expression of it, though mo^^ chiefly.

1. When we come into God house in regard of its relativ^ sanctity called the
beauty of hol^^nesse, in that Gods face shine most there in his Ordinance and
efficatious presence Psalm. 5.7.96.9.99.132. 1 Samuel 1.18 2 Samuel 12.20. Isa.
60.14.
though reflecting most honor where he is honored most which made Solomon
command this reverence in saying, when thou go into the House of God look
to thy feet; and the Prophet at the going out of the Temple, Ezekiel. ^6.2, 3.

2. When we prepare and ^ispose our selves to Prayer, Adoration is the best
inlet to our devotion. So David, Come ^et us worship (or worship in our first
approach) fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker Psalm. 9.^.
, to witness our humi^ity, fall, and low estate in Adam by our nothingnesse,
the more to advance Gods glory.

3. When we sum and seal ^p our prayers with Amen Neh. 8.6 Rev. 5.14.7.12.
Heb. 11.21
, ^oth as it is the Name of God, Rev. 3.14. which we are to admire and
reverence in the sense, not sound; and as it is a short repetition of what went
before, and profession of our concurrence with them, which made the Apostles
wind up all their Epistles with it, in that it is Cingulum consensus, and votum
desiderii nostri.

4. When God approaches to us in any extraordinary manifestations Genesis 18.23.
Job 40.4.46.6. Luke 5.8. Genesis 28.
of mercy or justice Job 1.20.
, our receiving of benefits Exo. 34.8 2 Chro. 7.3 20.18. Ps. 102.21 Rev. 11.16
17.
, returning of thanks Genesis 24.25, 52. Genesis 47.31 Heb. 11.21
, or bringing any other Sacrifice to God Heb. 13. Deuteronomy. 6.10.26.10. Micah. 6.6.
, votive, or devotive, Genesis 14.22. for God will not accept of mean, negligent,
and perfunctory duties Mal. 1. Psalm. 99.132 138.
, nor such service and reverence as an earthly King will scorn and reject from
his Subjects and vassals.

Now as the time is Always, so the place must be every where Joh. 4.20
; though amongst the Jews it was performed either in or toward Jerusalem, for
uniformity, Gods promise of his vertuall presence being there 1 Kings 9.3.
, and Christ's coming, whose types were there treasured up in the Arc; and not
for any inherent holiness; yet Christians may, if commanded, worship (as they
did) toward the East, for the order and regulation of their devotions, the
commemoration of our great benefits by Christ, the expectation of his second
coming, the appearing of our Sun again in that Horizon, and the usual
exhibition of Himself, his body and blood, in that part of the Church. But
then it must not be done to the scandal of our brethren, nor so repeated as if
the Duty were riveted locally or fixed to any place, since Churches and the most
holy parts in them, 1 Kings 8.6. though estimation may make a difference, have
no inherent, but relative and representative holiness in them; nor had amongst
the Jews, though their Three divisions were sanctified to three functions, the
Holiest to the divine presence, in that all the Types were kept there, the holy
of Holies for the Priests Sacrifices and Leviticall Rites; the outward Court or
Atrium for single worship. Prayer and Doctrine. The two first were buried with
the Temple, the last only is common to all Isa. 56.7. John 2.
, so as all ought to concur in a reverentiall way of serving God in places
set apart for those pious uses.

But to sum up all, let us consider Adoration, 1. Quae Origo suae
productionis. 2. Exhibitio honoris. 3. Ratio exhibitionis.

And in the first is Actus fidei, nam fides ostendit cur principaliter Adoratio
sit exhibenda.

2 Actus Charitatis; nam charitas facit diligere Deum, ut optimum and summum
bonum, and per hoc imperat and facit adorare Deum.

3 Act us Justiciae, and so vel reddit aequale, vel possibile; it returns
either what is due and equal, or what is possible. But because we cannot
perform the first, we owe the second in all expressions of duty, reverence and
devotion humane nature and a created being can attain to. Thus Ranevius in
lib. 1. de Adora. As it is the one great end of Gods wor^^ preached 1 Cor.
14.25.
, and purestact o^ outward piety, the best draw^ Picture of inward reverence
for the acts of the soul ar^ secret and mystical, and onel^ intelligible in
Vestigiis, as the prints of the feet declare the way we walk in, the bene^
sicence of the hand the bene^ volence of the heart, the going as low as we can
in co^^porall gestures, the depth o^ our humility and souls devo^tion; and
this not only in re^spect of man, but God, wh^^ judges and rewards us acco^^
to our works, though the sea^^ cher of the hearts and reins not according to
intuitiv^ knowledge, but outward ma^nifestation and evidence. S^ as the best
title to our ad^vancement arises from our ^reatest abasement of our ^^lves, our
glory heightning ^om our shame. For like the ^eacock when he moults his ^pall
Feathers to enrich his ^lume, our divesting our ^lves of all outward
great^esse, and casting our selves ^owne at Gods footstool, is ^e way to be
clothed with honor, and raised to a ^hrone; like the best Timber, which ever
grows highest up^ard when most rooted and ^^cpest in the earth, we ever ^ceive
a measure of glory ac^rding to our degrees of ^mility, not only in throw^^g
our selves upon the earth, ^^t earth upon earth, dust ^^on our selves, that
lying ^^ried there in thought of ^^ortality we might rise to an immortal
felicity for ever, (...) bless the Lord with his bless^^ Angels that excel in
streng^^ and do his commandemen^^ Pal. 103.20.
and all his holy Saints, sa^^ing, Worthy is the Lamb t^^ was slain to
receive riches, (...) power, and wisdom, and streng^^ and honor, and glory,
(...) blessing for evermore. And (...) only saying, but really ex^^ biting
that worship in a visi^^ adoration Rev. 5.12, 14, 7.11.12.
. And if s^^ humility and reverence sh^^ be our glory when we glor^^ God by
such emissions in H^^ven, what postures low a^^vile enough can we finde^
compose our selves into wh^ we draw nigh into his prese^^ here, unless with
David (...) introduce and usher in ev^^ address to God and act^^ Devotion with
Adoratio^^ for Jerusalems gate is very low ^^uilt, and hardly to be entered ^^n
any other posture; and ^^oth kneel and fall down before him, Psalm. 95. if we
expect ^is hand to raise us, his providence to guide us through the ^^tion, and
dismiss us with a ^lessing, when we believe with ^ur hearts, confess with our
^outhes, and wind up all with ^he corporal attestations of ^he souls ecstasies
and holy ^ansportation, which is nothing less then Heaven in Ef^^gie, a
dawning or inlet to an ^ternall day of happiness.

Of Alms, Fasting, and Prayer.
MAn in his creation was made like unto God, that he might serve that God who
created him in holiness^ and righteousness all the dai^^ of his life: But
loosing that privilege by his own rebellion, was yet redeemed to (...)
capacity of recovering by fait^ what he lost by disobedience^ and to the
manifestation of i^ in all the holy effects of sanctification, to which God
laye^ claim by right of Dominion Col. 1.16, 17. And so we owe him subjection,
1 Cor. 6.20. By ^onquest, so homage, Romans 6.^^. By covenant, so fidelity, ^^.
16.8. By communion, 1 ^^r. 15.10. John 14.17. So our ^earest affections, which
we should the more study all ex^ressions of, for having so grie^ously provoked
him by our ^ransgressions. And therefore ^s all the fruits of sin have ^^rung
from one root of bit^ernesse, and hang or grow upon Three branches, our ^oules,
Bodies, and Estates; ^o let us from one principle of Grace correct and alter
their nature, or new load those ^ranches with contrary fruits and productions.
That the ^^after of our Vineyard who ^igs and plants, dresses and ^aters for
that end, Isa. 5.
may reap ^ll and well laden Clusters from us for his care and preservation of
us: our goods in work of Charity and Alms, o^ bodies in works of
Mortification, our souls in works (...) Piety and Devotion, whi^^ with
Aquinas 2.2 ae. Qu. 85. A^^ 3. are our principal Christi^^ Sacrifices, and
acts of divi^^ worship, and therefore wo^^ thy of our consideration a part
though ever to be joined an^ united in our practice.

Of Alms.
Alms is a fruit of Sanctification, and called by so^^ Misericordia, which is
n^^ only Miseriacordis, a fellow feeling of others miseries (...) regard of
their afflictions, b^^ a virtue dilating it self inactions of Charity, and
like sounds and smells communicative as far as it can extend any thing of its
influence. For the soul (as the womb of the Virgin) not sooner conceives such
impressions from the Spirit of God, but they presently quicken into desires,
and keep it in travel till some fair opportunity midwife them forth into
charitable actions, in which it retains some dark resemblance of God in his
operations, who from all eternity first framed the Model, conceived the Idea
in himself of all things, then hatched and disclosed them in the shape of
mercies^ to us in time which from everlasting he had decreed, according to the
council, not absolute Sovereignty of his will, Ephesians. 1.
in that his goodness (...) diffusive, yet not lessening by participation; for
the Apostle calls him the father of mercies 2 Cor. 1.3
to show that as Father an^ Son are relatives, the o^^ ever supposing the
other; s^ father of mercies in the plural, to declare their num^rousnesse, and
that they an^^ the children as it were of hi^ nature, no less then Christ
(...) the Son of his Person; t^^ teach us that this affection is a^^ it were
Gods darling and a du^^ grounded in the law of natur^^ and expressed in that
mutua^^ self-seeking relief in distresse^ that every man has ingraft^^ in
him, commanded by Mos^ and the Prophets Deuteronomy. 7.17. M cah. 6.
, raise^ and spiritualized by Christ by giving us a pattern in a precep^ to
imitate beyond imitation, for be you merciful (says he) ^s your heavenly
Father is merciful, in quality not equality. And by the Apostle it is called
pare Religion and undefiled Jam. 1.27 Psalm 4.18.
. ^ Sacrifice well pleasing to God Heb. 13.16.
, nay accounted our Righ^ousnesse Pro. 20.2 Psalm. 24.5. and 112.9.
, and a means of appeasing his wrath Dan. 4.27.
, being offered in Heb. 11.^ Gal. 6.10. John 3.17.
faith and obedience, which made David say (as an Hebrew tradition tells ^s) as
often as he gave Alms, I will see thy face in righteousness; for the poor
are owners, and have a title to our Alms Pro. 3.27.
. So as here justice and mercy do meet and kiss each other, yet become not a
Righteousness justifying but declaratory, and an evidence of our justification
hereafter, in that we endeavor to do justice here, Snum euique tribuere, which
made the Jews say i^ begging give me the Commandment, and do not by
withholding the Mammon of the poor turn it to the unrighteous Mammon, Hosea
5.11. for then it will prove a sin f^^ damnable in the negation of it, though
neither meritorious nor satisfactory for sin in i^^ highest perfection, as a
Go y^ cursed into everlasting flame^^ belongs to it; and therefore we^^ it
good to find out some measure or direction to regulata our selves by, in the
dispensation of our charities, especially since Christ seems to command a
giving without measure, as the best measure t^ give by; when he says, Sell a^
that thou have and give it to the poor Mat. 19.21.
. But to this I answer as will plainly appear from the context, that it was
but a command of trial, and particular to the boasting young man, and no
precept challenging universal obedience, because not reconcilable to many
other places of Scripture, 1 Timothy 5.8. And therefore out of general principles
and examples not personal Mandates we must form our care and compass to
steer by in this so weighty duty. And our first rule shall be, to be as
universal in our obedience, as God is in his command, Do good to all, though
chiefly to the household of faith Gal. 6.10
; rather seeking fit objects for our charity, then suffering them to find us,
in that we are but the poor thens Stewards who have an interest both in our
wealth and increase, so as their propriety lies in our possessions, which we
ought at least weekly to account for, 1 Cor. 16.2. and to make our ability the
gage and size of our bounty, justice, o^ charity to them, with relation to our
families, condition, quality and other circumstances. But some from a
computation of the Jews laying aside a Tenth part of all their Incomes every
Third year Deuteronomy. 26.12. and 14.28.
for charitable uses, would in a proportion to that oblige us to an assignation
of a Fifteenth part every year, besides the mercy and compassion we are to use
in case of debt or other engagement Deuteronomy. 13.1, 2.
, as the highest expression of righteousness inherent though imperfect, Mich.
6.6. Romans 5.7. Dan. 4.27. And surely except we go beyond them in this, we fall
much short of our duty, since the Gospel is but a Lecture or Epistle of love,
and love the completion of our Evangelicall Law. Yet I am not so severe as to
tie any body to this rule; for then though love may be in the act, it were not
an act of love, which for the measure of its expressions ought to be voluntary,
free and elective; which truly and indeed is the ground of our reward. Thus
the Apostle, 2 Cor. 9.6. He that s^^^eth bountifully shall reap bountifully.
And who would be sparing of his seed that were sure of an answerable increase?
Yet here we must set and tune our charities to the limitations our callings and
relations put upon us, like Music, neither too high nor too low, the Mean
being the part that always sounds best in Gods ears, and that he rewards
most, though Gods glory not our own advantage should be the object and end of
it; for that is not given, but put to interest, that would not be given did he
not expect a retribution of advantage And therefore Solomon commands us to cast
our Bread upon the waters Eccles. 11 1.
; to sow our seed in the most barren soil, the poor man's breast, where it may
seem to be lost; and this too without any taint or mixture of vainglory
Matthew. 6.1.
; not giving to be seen, though we may be seen in giving; for though we must
not paint vice into a virtue, virtue may appear in its own beauty openly and
unmasked; Our lights must shine, though the end of holding them forth must be
Gods glory, not their own in appearing. And if we thus serve God, God will
bless us, in our Psalm. 41.1, 2, 3.
persons, in our Prove. 11.24, 25.
purses, in our Psa. 37.25 26. Prove. 13.22. 2 Cor. 99. Psalm. 112.2, 3.
posterities; for it is not only given to the poor, but Christ in them Mat
25.43.
; and so sure not only to be recorded in Heaven Acts 10.4, 31.
, but rewarded both temporally and eternally Ecclesiasticus 4.12 17, 22, 29.
Prove. 11.17, 16, 6, 25, 21, 22, 28, 27. Job 29.31. R^. 12 20.
. For the Christians Alms is his purse Eccl. 29. 1 Timothy 5 8. Gal. 6.10.
, which fills by emp tying; so as there is a gainful expense, a thriving
prodigality as well as a prodigal thrift Pro. 1.3, 7 and 11.24.
; an improving our Talent, by using, not burying it; by communicating both our
selves and ours in works of mercy to others, whether by the lips or hands,
instruction, or relief Lev. 19 17 Psalm. 51. Isa. 58. Prove. 1.4.33, 4, 2, 8.
. For he that thus gives to the poor lend to the Lord Prove. 19.17.
; and if God be our debtor (O most gracious descent, in that he that gives all
to us is content to borrow from us!) He will repay with interest Mat. 10. Luke
6. Pro. 14.21, 23.
; and if we become eyes to the blind and feet to the lame; He will never suffer
us to want light to direct, and limbs to carry us to him for mercy in our
necessities, Job 29.

From all which considerations, since we are but God^ Almoners, and the poor
man^ Alms box, let us give with a large heart and an open hand, knowing that
we should receive Gods blessings like the ground that drinks in the rain,
but to make it more fruitful; and the stomach that takes not in the meat (its
food) to monopolize, but di^^ribute it to the most mean and remote members, not
to ^ury nor consume, but to man^ge and improve them for Gods glory.

First, as the chief end for which we were created, 1 Cor. ^0.3. Ephesians. 2.10.

Secondly, in a thankfulness ^or our redemption, Lu. 1.74, 75

Thirdly, for the good of others in regard of the bond of nature, Gal. 6. Heb.
13.

Fourthly, as part of our evidence for Heaven, Matthew. 25. ^rov. 19.17. Esdr.
8.21. 1 Cor. ^.7. and sure marks of our election, 1 Pet. 1.10. Our goods being
nothing to us, till boun^y animate and send them abroad with sincerity, not
vanity, to do good to others; but then they will prove like the Widows myte
more ponderous, and of richer value (...) the balance of the Sanctuary then
the Indies would be i^ the Mine, the Oar in the Earth, where it lies useless
(...) us. So as the Christian should be like the Clouds, emptying themselves
for others usefulness, and dropping refreshment, if not fatness on (...)
below them, even by the example of God himself, preferring Mercy before all
other Sacrifices, Matthew. 9.13.12.7. Luke 6. which is the cause it (...)
sometimes called perfection Matthew. 5.48.19.21. If justice be joined to it,
Prove. 3. For we must not feed the poor (...) some wild beasts do th^^ young
ones, upon plunder and rapine; not with others bread, but our own; even
sometimes taken from our ordinary not superfluous diet, to relieve them that
want. For with such Sacrifices God is well pleased, Heb. 13.16, not so much in
respect of our goods, as our goodness, which he values according to the
affection they proceed from originally, our love to him ever including that to
our brother. So as there is but Vnus amor, duplex objectum; and therefore when
affectio cordis goes with Opus manuum; a contrario, a stony heart without
commiseration and beneficence, and a withered or contracted hand, that puts not
forth it self to communicate, God hates. For he is the weigher of the spirits
as well as the purse, and accepts the gift when offered as a tribute of
gratitude, not as a bribe to corrupt the Judge, that by doing some good we
might be licenced to Act the more evil, never valuing our purses, unless our
persons are first his, Genesis 4. and that we give our souls as well as our
substance, which we shall need no other encouragements for then to consider

First, that the object of our Charity is not the poor man, but Christ in him;
For I was naked, and ye clothed me not, says he, hungry, and you fed me not.

Secondly, the matter of our Charity is not ours but Gods; an ear only out of
the full harvest. He has given us some crumbs from a well furnished board,
some drops from a cup that runs waste.

Thirdly, the end of our charity, for Da and debtor ero, if we give pence,
God will repay us pounds; for Grains massy weights, and those of glory; for
drops of cold water, rivers of joy and pleasure for evermore. So that at our
general accounts, though the sum and total of our di^bursments are little
or rather Ciphers. nothing to what we owe: in our receipts God will add
figures to them, not only to exceed our numeration but to pose Arithmetic it
self, multiplying our joys beyond Multiplication, and summing them up in an
eternal felicity, a happiness beyond augmentation or diminution. So as if we
lay our foundation in charity, we shall raise a structure of glory, and gain
an inheritance that is never to be lost, become heirs of God, nay coheires
with Christ for ever and ever.

Of Fasting.
FAsting, as it is a forbearance of Meat, is of an indifferent nature, neither
good nor bad, but in order to the ends for which it is performed. And if used
as a holy Discipline, which every Christian is to exercise upon himself, may
be accounted a kind of spiritual Sacrifice as an act of self denial, and
more particular consecration of our selves to God, both bodies and souls to a
higher eminency of devotion and service, by an abstraction of our selves the
more from all sensual and worldly thoughts and delights, as far as necessity
or decency will permit; that by the hunger of the body the soul may be put
into a divine emulation after Spiritual food, and make a heavenly man become
as it were an earthly Angel; if he perform it with preparation, separation,
confession, and contrition, annoynting his head (that is Christ in his members)
in works of charity, and washing his face (his soul) in repentant tears,
Matthew. 6. But this may be either private or public.

A private Fast was a votive one in the old Law Number. 30 2.
, and a duty commanded in the new Testament. In that our Savior does not only
approve the Pharisees fasting twice a week (if purged and refined from the
alay of hypocrisy and vainglory) but add to it, and the practice of St.
John's Disciples, a precept Mat. 19.14, 15. Mat. 2.19, 20.
, that after the Bridegroomes taking away they should fast; with rules both for
the manner of it Matthew 6. Luke 5.33 35. Jam. 4.9.
, and Musical part, the well tuning of it, which he left to their own
elections. And therefore let us be careful as at all times to live soberly and
temperately 1 Cor. 6.19. Gal. 5.21. Romans 13.13. Titus 2. 1 These. 5. 1 Pet. 4.3.
, in regard of their necessity and happy use to be frequent in our holy
Fasting, which if rightly performed (as the needle the thread) will ever usher
in a blessing and reward Matthew. 6.
, yet it is not the act but the intention that commends it.

First, as it is a fruit of godly sorrow, and corrective justice, when from a
reflection of our sins past we thus punish them, Judge our selves to prevent
being judged 1 Cor. 11 31.
, which ever includes execution as well as sentence in it 2 Cor. 7.11. Jam 4.9.
Joel 2. Luke 23.20, 29. Da^. 10.3. Psalm. 35.
. In that the crucifixion of sin is the life of virtue, and made one say
Semper virtuis cibus jejuuium fuit. Fasting or taking meat from the Body is the
food of the soul.

Secondly, as it disposes to other holy duties, wings our prayers and makes
them more prevalent. True it was used for the obtaining the holy Ghost Acts 2.
, in the ordination of Ministers, Acts 14.33, 37. working of miracles Matthew. 17
21.
; and as it was the first Commandment Genesis 3.3.
, the life of Heaven, Preface to the Promulgation of the Law Exodus 24.18.
, and Prologue to the Gospel Mat. 4.
.

Thirdly, as a part of God^ worship: Thus Anna served the Lord with Fastings
and Prayer Luke 2.37, 38.
; the one the souls the other the bodies Sacrifice Psalm. 35.
though when twins they are of most prevalency with God as in Cornelius Acts
10.4
. For food (which is the teat of sin) being taken away, will humble and
starve it; and the killing of that will make us live more vigorously to God,
and gain us the better audience in his great Court of Requests, our service to
him being a sure title of his favor to us.

Fourthly, as it is medicinal, for the preventing of sin, and correcting of
our too rank and mellow soil, which of it self is too apt to bring forth
such weeds and luxurious growth 1 Cor. 9.27.
; for the body (...) nourished with sweet, the ^ule with sour or no meats;
which makes our God like a good Falconer give us tyring, and keep us sharp,
that we might soar and fly the higher ^our meditations and gain an evidence of
the Spirituality of of our condition.

As a means to advance our charity, enabling us to give the more to the poor,
when we are sparing toward our selves Isa. 58.7.
; for without that our forbearing of meat will be but the figure of famine, not
image of a Religious fast, or the devils Fast only, in not eating, if not by
Alms feeding the empty Acts 10.4 31. Dan. 4.27. Jonah 3.7, 8.
. Or that of the beasts in Nineveh, which ended only in hunger.

6. As a part of that Righte^ ousnesse wherein we are to exceed the Scribes and
Pharisees, i^ we will entitle our selves to the reward of it in Heaven Luk 18.12
. For it is an integrall part of ou^ devotion, and reckoned with Prayers and
Alms, Matthew. (...) Though their severe practice of it does shame our loo^^
profession. Their false and hypocritical Fasts, (fasting though not as they
should) o^ not fasting at all.

Seventhly and lastly, as a part of the discipline of repentance, to afflict
the soul Isa. 58.3, 5. Joel 12.13. Levit. 23.29, 32.
, wherein every sense to the proportion of the pleasure it took in sin,
should share i^ suffering. Which made some of the learned observe, that the
same word in the original signifies both an eye and fountain; that as it is
the chief ^^et of sin into the soul, (...) ^ight upon the first sight of
(...) again weep its own pen^^nce, and shed tears to evidence the hearts
remorse. And (...) I am sure that if that be ^^^fe mourner, (as it ought) (...)
sensual appetite, and all ^^inferiour servants will put (...) Blacks, and
bear their several parts in its sufferings. ^^y such was the humble ^^ce many
penitents in for^er times had of their sins, (...) as St. Jerome ( Hornil. 3.
ad (...) Antioch) observes; fin^ing no confidence in themselves, nor ways to
extenuate ^^^r iniquities, they durst (...) for shame and abhorrence (...)
their vildenesse, presume (...) speak their wants, nor in^^ate Gods pardon in
their own names; but betoo^ themselves to the Beasts ((...) in Joel 1. * Romans
8.
and Jona 3.) to gr^^ out their woeful complaints by making them partners their
sufferings; and cau^^ little infants to fast, that th^^ innocent cries might be
hea^ for their loud sins; nay, (...) a reverent Divine says, (...) pentance
may be pardoned greater absurdity then th^^ for so unspeakable are (...) griefs
and compunctions with in (if true) as she man times to common judgment is
guilty of actions more unreasonable; not willing the any should escape a share
(...) her sorrows, but wishes the whole frame of nature unhinged in asympathy
with her the Sun to withdraw (...) light, the Earth to keep back (...)
spring, the infant to have (...) ^reast, nor the beast a pa^^e; by these
effects to make (...) the more sensible of our ^^sgressions, and the more
^^ying our selves all out^^d comforts; making the (...) Pavement our richest
^^ins, anguish and sorrow (...) bread; our drink salt ^^res; till Gods
pardoning your and refreshing beams ^^me to relieve us in such ^^es of
pressure or particular ^^ertions.

from all, this conclusion is (...) be raised, that as the pri^^ry object of
our fastings and humiliations, is sin, and Gods displeasure for it: Our ^^^e
and ends ought to be ^^^s glory and our own a^^ndment. Though sometimes they
may be kept for the aversion of public (...) private judgments, and (...) an
outward evidence of (...) inward humiliation und^^ them 2 Samuel 11.11. 1 Kings
8. 2 Chro. 6.24, 25. Exodus 17. Lam. 3. Isa. 22. Jere. 22. Jer. 9.1. Dan. 9.10,
3. Psa. 33.109 23, 78, 106 31, 50, 81. 2 King. 19.20, 22.
, besides those oth^^ great ends before express^^ Only let us exclude all
hypocritical sinful and unprofitable ones from all relation to the souls
happiness.

For it is not the Philosophers fast, to keep pure the senses; nor the
Politicians fast to increase our plenty, and harden our selves for want and
sufferings; nor the Mise^ fast, that keeps empty h^^ belly to feed his purse;
not Ahabs, to murder and plunder the innocent; nor the poor man's fast,
jejunium (...) junii, as one calls it, that fast because he has not to eat nor
the Gluttons, that forbeares one meal that he might ^^ble balance his vessel
at ^^other, not as an abstinence ^^^h Meat, but as sauce to (...) pen his
appetite in eating; (...) the Physicians, to digest ^^^rfet, nor to humble the
^^dy, unless it be in order to (...) sanctifying of the soul; ^^t it is only
the stamp of ^^linesse and sanctified ends, that makes a fast current, and
^^oes it valve with God; yet (...) this we must observe a mea^^ and moderation,
not murdering a friend when we would destroy an enemy.

Now as Private so Public ^^asts are in their rules and li^^tations almost
interchangeable, being both of the same (...) are and only differing in (...)
election of the Time, Place and Company; for in private Fasts, the musical
part, th^^ well tuning of them is ours (...) every particular man's as (...)
condition and spiritual estate requires it: but public Fast (...) are ever
to proceed from the^ supreme civil Magistrate p^^^marily, though
derivatively and by the Church; for no man striving for a mastery is crowned
unless he strive lawfully, says the Apostle. And the^^ they command and exact
ou^ obedience Number. 10. Deuteronomy. 33.3. Isa. 1.58. Joel 2.15. Zac. 7.5. Ion. 3.7. 1
Pet. 2. 1 Samuel 7. 1 Kin. 2.21. Esth. 3.
if called for the obtaining some publique^ Mercy, or averting some judg^ment;
for where Singula g^^nerum, as well as Genera sing^^ lorum, all are concerned,
(...) becomes every particular man^ interest multiplied; for like^ many sticks
in a faggot clos^ bound, commonly they burn^^ or are preserved together. A^^
therefore in our greatest extremities when all humane ^helpe fayles us, let us
after the example of the best men and times have our eyes in this way fixed upon
God, 2 Chor. 20. E^. ^ 21. '3. Neh: 1.9. Est. 4. Je. 36 Zeph. 1.2. Isa.
55.6.58. Joel. 1.2. Am 4.12. D^n. 10.
being many and yet but one man in public duties, when one in dangers, Act.
4.32.

But in public Fasts some are fixed, and standing both under the Law and
Gospel Lev. 23.27.32. Zach. 8.19 M^r 9.14. Act. 13.3.
. As with us Rogation and Ember weeks, and our Lent Fasts to ^eepe in
commemoration the memory of Christ, miraculous Fast for us by such an
abstinence as is proportioned to the size of nature not desire, Dan. 10.3. That
as the Church has her public sins, she might appear as one penitent
before God in her Humiliations, and admit her excommunicated and scandalous
offenders to a reconciliation upon their public penance, and satisfaction
for open faults. Others there are arbitrary and elective for the time to our
superiors, and are either Number. 6.3.4.
Apportionall or Leuit. 16 29.31.
Integrall, ever to boe observed (when called for National, acted or enacted
sins) according to the rule prescribed: Pro. 1.8. yet with this indulgence
from our Mother the Church, that if we cannot all (though Qui potest capere,
capiat,) we may do what we can to humble, not destroy nature, neither making
our bodies wantons nor drudges. And in this measure we may likewise shape our
private Fasts, by making them longer, or shorter, total, or apportionall, a^
occasion, or our abilities require. though the usual standard of the Sanctuary
was a total abstinence from even till even Lev. 16.29. and 23.32. Joel. 1.2.
; But sometimes practiced with alteration. Thus Peter, Acts 9, 9. Cornelius,
Acts 10.30. Ezra, 10.6. Hest. 4.16.2 Sam. 3.35. and Dan. 10.3. Number. 6.3.4. not
in an absolute abstinence, but hard diet; only these cautions are to be
observed.

1. That for the time dedicated, we must observe it as a Sabbath day with
equal strictness both for Piety and Devotion, Isa. 58.13. Act. 9.10. 1 Cor. 7.

2. It must be penal, for the afflicting our souls in forbearing food and
other delights, as an act of corrective, Justice and fruit of Repentance, Psalm.
35.13. James 4.9. 2 Cor. 7.9.11.

3. Pious in the exercise of our charity, and other works of mercy, Esaias
58.6.10. Zach. 7.9.

4. Laying aside all outward ornaments, Ex. 33 6.
and casting ashes upon our heads (that is thoughts of our mortalities,) As the
Rudder of the ship to steer us in an even and fase course: for though
nakedness be the Ladies pride, and beggars shame, let us be ashamed of nothing
but our pride; but when beggars before God, not appear brave toward men, but
uncloath our selve^ divest our souls of inwa^^ vanities and appear in t^^
most humble posture before him, covering our selv^^ with sackcloth out of the
Poor man's wardrop; And winding our bodies in it as a Corpse ready for burial;
by that silent act to speak our selves fitter to lie in the ground then to
breath upon it; making every part a sharer in our sorrow as they were in our
sin, Romans 13.13. For thus turning our music into mourning, our Organ with
Job, Job. 30.31.
into the voice of weeping, Psalm ^37.
(our unaccented sorrow expressed in our groans and sighs, and our chattering
with the Crane, being the sweetest melody in the ears of God) we shall keep
our selves at home in thoughts of our own vi enesse, and by that confinement
enlarge our selves to run the round of Gods Commandments; and by that circle
here attain a circle within a circle, infinite infolded happiness in Heaven:
So as our holy Fasts will prove the Vigils to the great Festival of the supper
of the Lamb where we shall for ever feed upon joys immense, unspeakable,
eternal.

Of Prayer.
PRayer is the very top branch of the worship of God, the breath and flame of
faith, A duty in which we acknowledge God in all his attributes and depend
upon his providence, a divine grace inspired, an arrow taken out of the Qiver
of Heaven, which feathered with love, zeal, and perseverance, ever pierces
into Gods presence above and conqers all difficulties below. It is like the
Angel in Jacobs vision that ascends with our requests, and descends with Gods
blessings; A nimble messenger or Mercury, that can travel in a thought, and
fly upon the wings of the wind; for fill but its sales with a gentle gale from
a groan or sigh To. 8.26
, the holy spirit being its Pilot and Christ its Pole Star it will soon arrive
at heaven, and return with a rich lading of mercies. But then we must be sure
as it proceeds from Faith, so it must be unfeighned; from zeal, it must be to
Gods glory, Jam. 5. Heb. 11.
from our hearts, they must be pure, Pro. 15.8 Psa. 50.16.17.66.18. Eccl.
8.11. Isa 66.3.59.11. Psalm. 45.
for where the tongue is the sphere, the heart must be the center in all
lifting up clean hands without wrath or doubting, and not only clean white
with innocence, but active too in all things that may conduce to so high an
end; for pro quo quis oret, pro eo laboret; hearts and hands, eyes and tongues,
with all other faculties should concur to the pulling down of Gods blessings
upon our selves or the whole Church. Lam 3. Psalm. 45.47.123. Nay our very
enemies who ought ever to be one object of our Prayers with relation to
spiritual mercies, Lev. 19, 18. I uke 6.23. Mat. 5. as well as our friends,
nay more, as most wanting them.

Now as Prayer is the genus (a comprehensive word) so there are many species
and several manners of Invocation, as Orall, Mental, Public, Private,
Extempore or premeditate, and other Members and branches expressed by St. Paul
Tim. 1.3 Phil. 4.6, 7
, As supplication ex suppliciis, Prayers Ora rationis, Intercessions for
others, and giving of thanks for all, to make up a complete body of Prayer
which we may again sum up in Confession of sins, gratitude for Benefits,
and petition for Mercies. But in the consideration of these we shall not take
them in any Method, but involvedly, as they twine and interweave one with
another, and reduce all to private and public Prayer.

1. Private Prayer, where God gives the spirit of grace and supplication Zach.
12.10. Gal. 4.6. Psalm. 25.4, 5.119.12.33.
, as the spring and fountain from whence all mercies flow, is a duty commanded
as a means Ph i. 4.6.
, and always successful in regard of the end of obtaining our desires Mat.
7.7 Jer. 33.3. Pro. 2.3.5. Ez. 36.37. Jer. 29. Deuteronomy. 4.7. Ps. 86.5. To. 10.12.
Jud. 20. Jam. 4.7. Lu. 11.13: Isa. 65.24.
, If we give God our whole heart Pro. 23.26
, continue watchful before Him with fear and fervency of spirit; Col. 4.2.
To. 12.11. Psalm. 2.11.5.7.
for the hearts of all the faithful are compared to golden Vialls full of
odors or Incense Apoc. 3.8 Psa. 141.2
, which is the Prayer of the Saints. And if zeal be the fire to make them
ascend and become a sweet savor to God, our Prayer thus sent up to Heaven
under the great seal of love (like the Court Earwig) will never fail of a
gracious audience and return. But when we unclaspe and anatomize our souls,
and shame our selves in confessing our past rebellions before God^ Josh. 7.7. 1
Jo. 1. 1 Kings 8 Lev. 5. Dan. 9.4. and by our debasement advance his goodness,
He will forget what we remember, and give not only more then we can desire,
but prevent us in asking Isa. 65: 24.
; for Prayer faithfully performed is Gods favorite and darling, and the issue
of the soul, as children of the body, the one by a natural, the other by a
spiritual Generation; and of such efficacy, though they want expressions to
Midwife them forth, as they can in many other ways deliver themselves, and
never want a vert^all, though many times an orall voice. For, as one observes
upon Psalm. 32. God has his ear in our hearts, before we have any words in our
mouths; nay To. 8.26.
groans and sighs do many times express the unexpressible secrets of them Jo.
11.33.38.
. And the posture of the eye speaks the disposition of the soul, with good
Jehoshaphat 2 Chro. 20.12.
, Or it weeps a Prayer Heb. 5.7 Lu. 7.44.47 Job. 16.20. Eccl. 35.15 Psa. 6.8
38 39.42.72.79.
which is always a strong and prevayling, though silent, oratory with God; yet
He is so graciously ready to consider our wants and desires, that though
tears are the bes^ glass for him to behold u^ in, He will sometimes see a
wet heart in a dry eye, 2 Chro. 20.12.
the waters in the veins of the Earth before they bubble; accept our
intentions, the affections of a pious soul before they break forth into any
open streams of sorrow. And as the disposition is thus often taken for the
action, so actions alone are many times taken to be as expressive of inward
affections and become operative Prayers. Thus Phineas is said to pray, if we
compare Psalm. 106.30.31. with Numb. 25. (...), 8. And acts of Justice are
styled Petitions, Jo. 8. Ion. 3. Pro. 21.3. As Prayers acts of Justice in
becoming a sacrifice to God.

2 Public Prayer is an homage and out rent of the soul we owe to God; And
though it may take its denomination from a collection of two or three together,
it is ever best performed in the house of God, the place of Prayer, Mat. 21.13.
Lu. 19.45.46. 1 Kin. 8.2. Chro. 6.
And Gods residence Hab. 2.20
, the chamber of presence and Court of Requests, wherein he gives most gracious
audience, and is for glory like the gate of Heaven Genesis 28.16, 17.
and a place ever accounted the joy of Saints and delight of God himself, Lev.
19.30. and 26.2. Isa. 56.7. Isa. 7.11. Psalm. 11.4. and 48 and 2^ and 84, and
122, and 128, and 26, and 116.114. and 132.7. 1 Cor. 11.14.16.4.17. Mal. 3.16.
Heb. 12.28. Eccl. 4.17. So as there principally even with David in the great
Congregation we ought to muster up our devotions, though chiefly those Prayen
the Church we live in has leavied or assessed for God^ service, as a public
testimony of our piety for the winning others by our example, inflaming of
zeal, sending up a better perfume (as many flowers in one Nosegay), and the
giving them a greater prevalency; for unita vis for tior. If there be a promise
to a few, much more to many close knit together in the unity of the spirit, and
the bond of peace Ephesians. 4.3.
the outward conformity in worship, 1 Cor. 14. Society being like a faggot on
fire, wherein one stick keeps another glowing; or as stones in an arch, every
one holding and fastening his fellow: whereas solitude wants many such
advantages; which was the reason that God playing his own Critic could make
no exception to his own workmanship, but found all very good but man's being
alone. And therefore let us not separate from nor in Gods public worship,
which He so much hates as He would not commend his second days work (as one
observes upon Genes. 1.7.) because it was a work of division. Though ^here is
a latitude in private prayer, so as the groans of ^he Spirit are sometimes the
best eloquence, the Orator of transient and unfixt ejaculations being often
heard b^ God, when not taken noti^^ of by our selves, Psa. 32.6
and purpose accepted for performances (...) In public places all should be
done to the edification a^^ building up one another (...) our most holy faith,
for whi^^ the understanding as well as affections must meet in the cle^^ notion
of things we pray fo^^ And therefore though exten^^ porary prayer be lawful,
(...) forms for public use I co^ceive to be the best, m^^^ commendable, and
not on^ allowed in all ages, practi^^^ by all Churches since the P^^mitive
times (except for some latter years) but command^^ by God himself Deuteronomy. 26.3,
5.20.3. Number. 6.23 Exodus 15.1 21. Isa. 38 20. Matthew. 6.
. For it^ not the words, the wax the receives the impression, but the Spirit
the stamp that gives it, that makes our evidence pleadable in the court of
Heaven. And therefore let us consider

First, the infinite distance between God and us, which should make all our
addresses to be full of awful reverence ^o him, and not offer a perfunstory,
raw, and indigested prayer, the Sacrifice of fools, to the God of all wisdom.
And this made Solomon say, Be not ^as^ with thy mouth, and let not ^hy heart be
hasty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth;
therefore let thy words be few Eccles. 5.2.
. And if the distance betwixt ^ee and an earthly Prince ^ught to create such
apprehensions as the Prophet Malachi speaks of, Chap. 1.8. should we not be
choice in our offertories to God, whose vouchsafing of our best is a
condescension, there being no proportion or commensuration i^ what we owe, and
what w^ can do? Only as in the nature of things, so in manne^^ and Spiritual
Sacrifices, le^ our offerings be of the first and chiefest of the flock Mal.
1.11
; ou^ highest outward abilities and inward graces concurring; Augustine.
for nunquam in odoribus Sacris^^ ciorum delectatus est Domin^nisi in fide and
desiderio off^rentis.

Secondly, when God giv^ the Spirit of prayer, and other Divine gifts and
graces, th^^ are not to make us perfect (...) (...) instant, nor to assist us
by ^^aies immediate and extraordinary, as in the first plantation of
Christianity; but by mediate and mild courses; He carries us from one extreme
to another, from in^^^elity to true believing, by preaching Romans 10.17.
: not that it works physically, but as an instrument, as the window ^onveyes
and lets in light; Nor does he give the gift of ^reaching without study, nor of
prayer without premeditation; in both comparing Spiritual things with
Spiritual things 1 Cor. 2.13.
, and from thence forming their productions, ^^d improving their abilities. For
as one observes upon 1 ^or. 16. that is first that is natural, and then that
which is Spiritual, all infused habit^ working themselves up to th^^ several
degrees of perfection in men (though all imperfect in this life) by way of
improvement and acquisition, and make use of nature to regulate, not destroy
it, to act by it, and not with the bond^ woman to throw it out o^ doors, out
of Gods service Jud. v. 10
For the Spirit does but help our infirmities, not exclud^ them Romans 8 26
. And therefore h^^ that will neglect means to depend or presume of multiplied
Miracles, may fancy himself into damnation, a^ buses himself, not God, wh^^
commands us to speak as hi^ Oracles 1 Pet. 4.11.
, not lightly, bu^ deliberately, taking some form from thence, or inno^ bling
the faculties of nature by study, and the assistances of me Spirit, to frame
something in analogy to them. Thus we may be said to pray with the Spirit, and
with the understanding also 1 Cor. 14 15.
.

3. Set-formes of prayer are warranted to us by the examples of the best men
and times, may of Christ himself Mat. 26.37, 44. Mar. 14.35 39. Luke 22.41 42.
, and the holy Angels in Gods presence, where no imperfection (...) Rev. 5.9,
12. and 7.12.
; with the authority of a full Jury of men inspired, whose practice gave a
verdict for it. Thus Moses Number. 6.23. Exodus 15.1 21. 2 Chro. 5.13.26, and 6.41,
42 ^^ 38.9, 10 Pal. 136. Deuteronomy. 20.3. and 26.3, 5. 1 Cor. ^^ 26. Rev. 15.3.
, with many (nay all) others, in that set forms of blessing and praising God
was used by the whole Church: nay sung and said in Heaven; for so we sha^^
find that of Rev. 15. to be composed out of Exodus 15. Psa. 14.17. Jer. 10.6, 7.

4. Forms of prayer a^ commanded, and a pattern given not only to direct an^
regulate our prayers by, as is in Matthew, After this mann^ pray Mat. 6.9.
, but enjoined in man materiae and forma verborum, the words themselves; th^^
St. Luke Luke 11.2.
When you pray, s^^^ Our Father; that is, say the^ very words. And this mad^^
St. John (as Divines concen^ from Luke 11.1.) teach (...) Disciples a form for
publiq^^ and constant use both for o^der, edification, and the prevention of
many other abuse and inconveniences. For th^^ spirit of prayer lies not in
th^^ length nor strength of words, but in the devotion of the heart; and that I
am sure must needs be most vigorous when there is nothing to disturb it. By
which reason the understanding having before digested the matter, and settled it
self, may better go along with the affections in a premeditated or set form,
then it can in an extemporary prayer of another making. Because we must first
thoroughly and conscientiously weigh his expressions before we can concenter our
devotions in Amen, which is a short recapitulation of them, and the duty of
every Christian 1 Chro. 16.36. Deuteronomy. 27.15. 1 Cor. 14.16.
. But besides this advantage they are ^^sefull for the help of the ignorant,
the preservation of the unity of faith and charity and to hedge and fence in
the true Church from all fantastical extravagant mixtures, th^^ froth or
crudity of some men^ brains; and sometimes diametricall oppositions of the
Ministers prayers in their several Congregations, according to their
engagement of opinions or affections, which may disturb and distract the best
settled devotion Exodus 30 35. Deuteronomy. 26.5 Psalm. 96. 1 Cor. 14.40. Ecd. 5.2.
, even turning our prayers into sin, Psalm. 109.7. Nor is this a limiting of
the Spirit more then an ordinary, voluntary, varied prayer, of a private man in
public devotions, but a maintaining of our liberty; for we may pray with the
Spirit in both; since it is nothing but the Spirits praying, the act of the
inward man concurring with the expressions of another. For if it were
otherwise, then those that pretend to pray by the same extraordinary
transmission of the Spirit, would not one cross and contradict another in
their petitions, in that it is a Spirit of Love and Unity, not of division; but
must be able at ^east to show us some convincing evidence to declare which of
them have the true Spirit, by some extraordinary gifts, (...) those of speaking
diverse ^ongues, or prophesying ex tempore without the use of study of Arts;
whereas in the native and proper sense of praying with the Spirit all may agree
(...) we consider it in its first ^ctuall motions, or its teaching us the
matter and manner o^ our prayers, as well as the dictating the words. For the
power of prayer consis^^ chiefly in the extension of the Spirit, not in the
language o^ the tongue; the intensnesse o^ our zeal, not the fullness o^ our
expressions; though in tha^ we ought to contrive them in^^ the most contracted
and path^tick way we can, Eccl. 5. for the quicker the Bow is drawn, the
sharper it shoots, when standing bent to the height slac^^ its force. Which
made ou^ Savior Christ choose his sho^^ form, Matthew. 26.37, 44. (...) often
repeated out of Psalm. 2^ and other holy men premed^tate what they were to
offe^^ Job 9.14. Otherways Dav^^ would not have said, Pond^^ my words, O Lord,
had he not first weighed them himself.

Now if it be granted that it forms may be lawful (as that knowing man will
deny it?) but that premeditation of the matter, not words, is more useful; I
deny it upon the former grounds: And with the Apostles advise shall not in this
trust to any private spirit, or at least not prefer it to that more public
one of the Church in her Provincial, National, and general Councels; she
being both first and most concerned in the promises of Divine assistance, who
has ever composed short and powerful prayers most ponducing to Gods glory,
and the stirring up of the affections for public use, with the reservation of
a power to va^^ them as occasion should invit^^ still making the spirits of the
Prophets subject to the Prophet 1 Cor. 14 32.
in this and all things els^ that concern the due ordering of the public
Administrations, that the quit-rent^ we pay into Gods Exchequer in
acknowledgement of our fealties and subjection may not be in coin embased but
current, and bearing the stamp of authority. Thus in the Law where the Priest
was to offer for the sins of the people, his Sacrifice was prescribed, though
they as single persons were to measure their offering to their abilities; but
then in proportion though it were mean and poor, it was to be pure, and of
the best they could bring for Sacrifice to Gods Altar. Nor is this a ^eater
restraining of the Ministers spirit then a prescribing the matter, and heads
upon which he is to frame his petitions, making him only the Dictionary to sit
them with words; unless you conceive ^^ is the music of the ear as well as
that of the heart God delights in; whereas indeed the fruits and effects of the
Spirit are Essentials, not Ceremonials; the body of devotion, not the dress
and clothing. And therefore I could wish in all things of public worship
some Sinews and Nerves to hold all the members of Christ in a firm union,
some symbols of public communion, that all irreverences, impertinences and
impieties might be banished o^ solemn and public me^tings, and our Church
lik^ Jerusalem all one in it self Psa. 122.3
The whole Congregation one man, serving God wi^^ reverence and fear, truth
the inward man, and an humble decency without. For God stand in the
Congregation it will sure be fit for us, 1. To come. 2. To bow down. 3. To
kneel before the Lord maker Pal. 95.
.
and use all other expressio^ that may declare and ex^devotion, Psalm. 134.3,
87, 30, 132, 7. Luke 22.41, Dan. 5.10. Ezra 8 5, 9, 5. Ne^ 6, 5. Lam. 3.4. But
for th^^ refer to what I have ex^^essed upon the title of Ado^tion.

And upon these grounds (...) Church has ever thought ^^mes of prayer most
use^^ll and necessary for Gods ^ouse of prayer; where there ^ould be a daily
Sacrifice ^^ffered Heb. 13.
, (even the calves (...) our lips Ose. 14.2
, though not of ^ur stall) which has been of ^^^te so much neglected, as I
^^onceive, by reason of their ^^suse, and the suspension of ^^ose injunctions
that have in ^^rmer times obliged to it, so (...) I cannot but wish (if our
^ommon Prayer book may ^ot be again restored, when ^urged from those supposed
^^rrors some tender consci^nces have been offended at) that yet all forms may
(...) be abolished; since it may easily showed that the Chur^^ neither under
the Law (...) Gospel, if in a settled and pr^^perous condition) ever want a set
Liturgy for the regu^^tion of her public devo^^ons; and that the want of
amongst us has at least o^ scured (if not extinguished much of that Piety for
wh^^ this Nation was so blessed, it became the envy of all there is; and I hope
God of great and abundant mercy w^^ put it into the hearts and res^lutions of
those that have just power and calling for to cause the Besaleels of o^^ times
(those men that (...) has endued with most w^^^ dome and cunning for the
bu^^ding of his Church) to hew ^^d prepare some stones, and ^^ake them fit for
his Jerusalem; ^^at every unskilful workman ^ay not bring his rough and
^^ncast thoughts, and be ham^^ering and seeking for matter ^hen they should
with it knit (...) into the building; but have ready molded and squared ^^y
the most ancient and best ^^tternes even of the purest and Primitive times; as
ours ^as formerly modeld, both (...) use and ornament (like ^^e polished
corners of the ^^emple) wherein it was their ^^udence as well as Piety to
^^mpose their solemn Ser^^ce of such parts as might ^ost advance Religion,
in^^me the affections, and com^^y with the Ages infirmities, and conditions of
men; b^^^ reading some parts of th^^ Scriptures, with interposing (...)
Prayers, Psalms, Hymne^ and Spiritual Songs; that th^^ thoughts might be
thereby th^^ more elevated, and Gods pra^^ses manifested.

Praises for benefits, Praye^ for present and future want with an interweaving
tho^^ duties, that the returns of th^^ Spirit might be the more intense and
fervent; The inf^^riour powers of the sou^ (which cannot long contin^^ without
pain in any one p^^sture) kept up; and the u^derstanding (the higher pa^^ of
the mind) be raised wit^ the contemplation of tho^^ Divine and revealed
mysteri^^^ by this variety to becom^ helps and spurs to one an other, and
take new inflamma^^ons to pray from hearing the Word read.

From all which considera^ions the Church has accordingly composed her
Liturgies, and contracted the matter of her public Forms into fewest words,
knowing (...) is the vertuousnesse of the ^ind, not the copiousnesse of the
Language; fervent ^^titions not teadious tautol^^gies; much praying in few
^ords, not vain babbling in ^^ng prayers, that is accepable to God; ever
supplying ^^eir defects by the repetition (...) the Lords Prayer in every
^^verall return to that duty, ^^owing that God is not nau^^ated with one and
the same dish (as we in our diets) (...) the Spirit hand it into his presence;
nor are we forbid to pray the same Prayer often over, if we repeat it not as a
charm, or place power in the words (like the vagabond Jews Exorsists in Acts
the 19, 13, 16.) As if they had any Physical or innate virtue i^^ them, or did
produce any thing from being pronounced; But if we give form^^ to that matter
by the Spirit moving it, we pray well i^ the Name of Jesus 1 Io. 2.
though best when we use his words or shape our Prayers by tha^ absolute Copy
he has le^^ us; and then they will not (...) short, least by it we seem (...)
set too little a value upon (...) weighty a duty; nor too lo^^ for public
use, least the weakness and imbecillities of some in mixed Congregations
should stay behind or stop in the way, and not be able to go along in the
duty; But so tempered as may keep up all men's devotions to the highest pitch
they can be raised; for too much lassitude of spirits disposes to sleep and
lasie postures; whereas (...) percing brevity holds the intentions of the mind
most ^rect and least subject to flagging (like an Arrow, as I said that stays
but little at the ^ent before it be shot) nay we soar to Heaven sooner upon
the wings of ardent affections, then the train of long discourses Eccl. 5.
, which like a Thread never so well spunne weakens and ravel^ when drawn
beyond it^ length; only let us be sure to give them these Qualifications.

First, That they be made in Faith Heb. 11. Jam. 1.
; for as Prayer is the mouth of Faith, so Faith is the heart of Prayer.

Secondly, with zeal: for it is the fervent prayer of the Righteous that
prevails much Psalm. 38.55. Jam. 5.
; and the flame that ascends when the dull and heavy matter dies in its ashes
and proves its own grave.

Thirdly, with voriferation as well as intention; orderly and vocal Hos.
14.2.1, 3.
as well as mental; Thus David, Psalm. 141.142.1. For he cried, says the Text
(to shewhis inward fire and fervency) with his voice to give it the ornament
and advantage he could; knowing that as the Spouse must be all glorious
within, so her Dress should be of Needleworke and wrought Gold; and therefore
let us not only praise him upon the well tuned Cymbal (the heart,) but upon
the loud Cymbal (the tongue,) to show forth his honor, and speak his praises
in both.

Fourthly, with importunity, which made David redouble his voice, and echo
back his own words; For this is the Spiritual Engine by which Heaven suffers
violence, and the violent take it by force; so as he that asks shall obtain,
or if not obtain by asking, will find by seeking; or if not find by seeking,
will be sure by kno^king (a persevering importunity) to force Heaven gates^ for
with Abraham as long as we cease not praying God will not cease giving.

Fifthly and lastly, with humility: for like well layden Trees the more we are
hung with Gods graces, the lower they bend us; and not only invite Gods eye to
behold (but himself to reside in) us, who has no Heaven upon Earth but the
humble soul to inhabit Is. 57.15.
; and who would not do any thing to purchase such a guest? debase himself to
be so exalted, and with the no less good then great Patriarch, Preface his
Prayer with a humble con^^ssion of his own vileness, in saying I am but dust
and ashes, nothing either in foundation or structure but the most base, barren,
and useless Earth? neither is this grace a single virtue, but as it were the
Arc that keeps all other holy things in it.

Now if we thus suck the breasts of his promises, and have an eye of faith
always upon him, his will again meets ours; and then as the neutralists
observe, (when the nurse centers in the child's at the tet, and keeps in that
conjunction) the Milk will flow and nourish us both in body and soul to
eternal life; for the body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost here, and has
Heaven provided for it hereafter: if it beard its part in the Duty, as i^ hopes
for a share in the Reward.

Now having thus far considered the duty of prayer^ with the manner of
performing it, we should do well to allow it some set times; or if none, make
it but one continual duty; for so the Apostle commands us, 1 These 5.17. 1 Timothy 2. Ephesians. 6.18. ^ pray always in habit, if not is art. Ph. 4.6. Acts 10.2.
Thought in act too as often as our own private retirements or other
opportunities invite us, which was the reason the Church ever had her hours of
prayer consecrated and appointed for her public devotions, Psa^ 5.17. and
119.164. Mark 1.5, 40. Job 38.7. Lam. 2.19. is in the morning, Psalm 92.^. The
third hour of the ^ay, Acts 2.15. Mar. 15.25. Dan. 6.10. The sixth hour ^ the
day, Acts 10.9. Matthew. 10.5. Psalm 55.18. The ninth ^oure of the day, Acts
3.10. ^. Matthew. 27.55. And at evening, Genesis 24 63. Exodus 12.6. Psalm 65.8. Mar.
13.33, 35. But if we cannot this, let us ^oe what we may; and if not even times
a day, with David, it us at least Morning, Evening, and at Noone, praise our
God Psalm. 119.164. Psa. 55.17.
, making it the ^^ey to open our passage to ^^l secular employments, and ^^
shut them out when we ^^ire to rest; for then our Prayers like an Heavenly
exhalation drawn forth by the Spirit of God will as refreshing dewes fall down^
again upon our labor, an^ make them pleasing and fruitful.

But it may be objected tha^ Gods dearest servants, thoug^ frequent were not
alwaie^ successful in this duty, b^^ sometimes have prayed themselves into a
weariness, deection, and silence, if n^^ despair almost of being hear^^ Psalm
77.69.3.119.8.8.123 Lam. 3. Job 30.20. Matthew. 15^ 22, 23, 26.

To this I answer, that God^ displeasure is sometimes h^^ favor to us. And
that i^ not giving sometimes he gives us his greatest blessings; and does not
hear u^ either because he would have (...) and make us more importunate, or to
try our patience, exercise our faith and obedience, increase our humility, and
make us the ^ore value his benefits when ^^ have obtained them Mat. 15.28. 2
Cor. 12.7, 8. Cant. 3.1, 4. Luke 22.44. Psa. 37.40 1 Pet. 4.
. though he is always giving something equivalent (as ^od) if not the thing we
^^ke even when we ask it, ^ough perhaps not discernable to us; Thus to 2 Cor.
12 8, 9.
St. Paul; and to our Savior, who was ^^t heard in that the Cup did not pass
from him, Matthew. 26. and yet was heard in that ^od gave him other comforts ^^
poyse it, Heb. 5.7. So that is submission to his Fathers ^^ll obtained the
satisfaction ^f his own; whereas some in being heard are not hear^ Psalm. 106
15. and 69.22. Mal. 2.9.
, in that God then curse his own blessings, and with the fruit sends a worm t^
consume it, Pro. 1.31. Hos. 4.7 Psalm. 78.30, 31.

But to wind up all, if w^^ moderate our requests and bound them with
submission, and remain as fixed (...) the belief of Gods special providence to
us in all varieties of fortune, as we d^^ in the belief of a God Matthew. 6.33,

thus finished my weak and short meditations, I wish the gentle gayle of Gods
holy Spirit that fills the sails (as principle of all Spiritual motions) may
waft you into the harbor of sure peace an^ acquiescence in him; an^ that these
sparks and glint merings of consolation a^^ direction blown abroad from that
fire he has kindled a my heart may inflame you all that read this rough and
unpolished piece with the same affections I commend is to you, not looking at
the instrument, but hand that works by it; for if you reap advantage, and
gather fruit from this barren Tree of my planting, the weakness of the means
will be in improvement of GODS glory. Only I shall desire you will forget the
Author, and look upon the Object, or accept the odor of humility I send with
it, as my oblation to expiate for my other faylings; which cannot but make him
little in your eyes that is nothing in his own; The Earthen Pipe only which
God has used to convey some drops (I hope) if not streams of refreshing
comforts to your souls. And however looking to Jesus the Author and consum
ator of my faith and happiness Heb. 12.2
, I am resolved with patience to endure the cross, and despise the shame that
can be cast upon me for my honest intentions; being confident God will accept
my well aimed though ill shot Arrow, first taken out of his Quiver, and now
brought to His Altar; where I desire to offer up my self with it to be both
Priest and Sacrifice, though all be less then the least of his mercies which
are my guide and support here, and will be my reward hereafter: when he^ shall
transport me from Earth to Heaven, from a valley of tears to a mount of joys;
and those not fading or decaying (like the ripest and fullest blown pleasures
here;) (...) to fullness of joys, without either waine or eclipse; and that
fullness not narrow, or bounded, but in such a full measure, or measure of
fullness, as knows no measure or degrees; and that not momentary, but for ever
and ever; in a continual multiplication and succession of happiness; which
will always satisfy, never satiate, in that God is the object, the joy
immense; and all no less eternal then God himself.

FINIS.
