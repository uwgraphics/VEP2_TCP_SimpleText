SIR WALTER RAWLEIGH HIS APOLOGY For his voyage To GUIANA:

By Sir Walter Rawleigh Knight.

LONDON, Printed by T. W. for HUM: MOSELEY and are to be sold at the Princes
Arms in St. Paul's Churchyard 1650.

Sir Walter Rawleigh his Apology.
IF ill success of this Enterprise of mine had bin without Example, I should
have needed a large discourse and many arguments for my Justification, But if
the atempts of the greatest Princes of Europe, both among themselves and
against the great Turk, are in all modern Histories left to every eye to
peruse. It is not so strange that my self being but a private man, and drawing
after me the chains and Fetters whereunto I have been thirteen years tied in
the Tower, being unpardoned and in disgrace with my Sovereign Lord, have by
other men's errors failed in the attempt I undertook.

For if that Charles the Fifth returned with unexampled loss, I will not say
dishonor, from Algire in Africa: If King Sebastian lost himself and his Army
in Barbary: If the invincible Fleet and forces of Spain in Eighty Eight were
beaten home by the Lord Charles Howard Admiral of England: If Mr. Strozzi the
Count Brizack the Count of Vinnnoso and others, with the Fleet of fifty eight
sail and six thousand Soldiers, encountered with far less numbers could not
defend the Terceres. Leaving to speak of a world of other attempts furnished
by Kings and Princes. If Sir Francis Drake, Sir John Hawkins and Sir Thomas
Baskervile men for their experience and valor as Eminent as England had any,
strengthened with diverse of her Majesty's ships, and filled with Soldiers at
will, could not possess themselves of the Treasure they sought for, which in
their view was embarked in certain Frigotts at Puerto Rico, yet afterward they
were repulsed with fifty Negroes upon the Mountains of Vasques Numius, or
Sierra de Capira in their passage toward Panania: If Sir John Norris (though
not by any fault of his) failed in the attempts of Lysbone and returned with
the loss, by sickness and otherwise, of eight thousand men. What wonder is
it, but that mine (which is the last) being followed with a company of
Volunteers who for the most part had neither seen the Sea nor the Wars, who,
some forty Gentlemen excepted, had we the very scumme of the World: Drunkards,
Blasphemers and such others as their Fathers Brothers and friends thought it an
exceeding good gain to be discharged of them with the hazard of some thirty
forty or fifty pounds, knowing they could not have lived a whole year so
cheap at home: I say what wonder is it, if I have failed, where I could
neither be present my self, nor had any of the Commanders (whom I most
trusted) living, or in state to supply my place?

Now, where it was bruted, both before my departure out of England and by the
most men believed, that I meant nothing less then to go to Guiana: but that
being once at liberty and in mine own power, having made my way with some
Foreign Prince I would turn Pyratt and utterly forsake my Country. My being
at Guiana, my returning into England unpardoned, and my not taking the spoil
of the Subj. of any Christian Prince, has (I doubt not) destroyed that Opinion.

But this is not all: for it has been given out by an hypocritticall Theife
who was the first Master of my shipp: And by an ungrateful Youth which waited
upon me in my Cabin, though of honorable worthy Parents: and by others: That
I carried with me out of England twenty two thousand pieces of twenty two
shillings the piece, and thererefore needed not, or cared not to discover any
Mine in Guiana, nor make any other attempt elsewhere: Which Report being
carried secretly from one to an other in my ship, and so spread through all the
ships in the Fleet which staid with me at Trenidado while our Landforces were
in Guiana, had like to have been my utter overthrow in a most miserable
fashion; For it was consulted when I had taken my Barge and gone a shore
(either to discover or otherwise as I often did) That my ship should have set
sail and left me there, where either I must have suffered Famine, been eaten
with wild beasts, or have fallen into the hands of the Spaniards and been
flayed alive as others of the English, which came thither but to trade only,
had formerly been.

To this Report of Riches, I make this Protestation, That if it can be prooved,
either now or hereafter, that I had in the world, either in my keeping or in my
power, either directly or indirectly in trust or otherwise, above one hundred
pieces when I departed London, of which I had left forty five pieces with my
wife, and fifty five I carried with me: I acknowledge my self for a Reprobate,
a Villain, a Traitor to the King, and the most unworthy man that does live, or
ever has lived upon the earth.

Now where the Captains that left me in the Indies, and Captain Baily, that
ran away from me at Cancerota, have, to excuse themselves, objected for the
first, That I lingered at Plymouth when I might have gone thence, and lost a
fair Wind and time of the year, or to that effect. It is strange that men of
fashion and Gentlemen should so grossly belly their own knowledge: And that had
not I lived nor returned to have made answer to this Faction, yet all that know
us in Plymouth and all that we had to deal withal knew the contrary. For
after I had stayed at the Isle of Wight diverse days; the Thunder, Commanded by
Sir Warram St. Ledger by the negligence of her Master, was at Lee in the Thames;
and after I arrived at Plymouth, Captain Pennington was not come then to the
Isle of Wight, and being arrived there, and not able to redeem his Bread from
the Bakers, he rode back to LONDON to entreat help from my wife to pay for it,
who having not so much money to serve his turn, she wrote to Mr. Wood of
Portsmouth and gave him her word for thirty pounds, which she soon after paid
him, without which (as Pennington himself protested to my wife) he had not bin
able to have gone the journey: Sir John Fern I found there without all hope of
being able to proceed, having nor men nor money, and in great want of other
provision, insomuch as I furnished him by my Cozen Herbert with a hundred
pounds, having supplied himself in Wales with a hundred pounds before his
coming to Plymouth: and procured him a third hundred pound from the worthy and
honest Deane of Exeter Doctor Sutcliffe. Captain Whitney, whom I also stayed
for, had a third part of his victuals to provide, insomuch as having no money
to help him withal I sold my Plate in Plymouth to supply him. Baily I left at
the Isle of Wight, whose arrival I also attended here some ten or twelve days
as I remember, and what should move Baily only to leave me as he did at the
Canaries, from whence he might have departed with my love and leave, and at his
return to do me all the wrong he could devise, I cannot conceive; he seemed to
me from the beginning not to want any thing, he only desired of me some Ordnance
and some iron-bound Caske, and I gave it him; I never gave him ill language nor
offered him the least unkindnesse to my knowledge: It is true, that I refused
him a French Shallop which he took in the Bay of Portingall outward bound, and
yet after I had bought her of the French, and paid fifty Crowns ready money for
her if Baily had then desired her he might have had her; But to take any thing
from the French, or from any other nation, I meant it not.

True it is, that as many things succeeded both against Reason and our best
endeavors; So it is most commonly true, that men are the cause of their own
misery, as I was of mine, when I undertook my late enterprise without a pardon
for all my Company, having heard it avowed in England before they went, that
the Commission I had, was granted to a man who was Non Ens in law, so has the
want thereof taken from me both Arms and Actions: Which gives boldness to
every petty Companion to spread Rumors to my Defamation and the wounding of my
Reputation, in all places where I cannot be present to make them Knaves and
Liars.

It has been secondly objected, That I put into Ireland and spent much time
there, taking care to Revictuall my self and none of the rest.

Certainly I had no purpose to see Ireland when I left Plymouth, but being
encountered with a strong Storm some eight Leagues to the Westward of Scilly,
in which Captain Chudleyes Pinace was suncke, and Captain King thrust into
Bristoll: I held it the Office of a Commander of many ships, and those of
diverse Saylings and conditions, of which some could Hull and Try, and some of
them beat it up upon a Tack, and others neither able to do the one nor the
other, rather to take a Port and keep his Fleet together, then either to
endanger the loss of Masts and Yardes; or to have it severed far asunder,
and to be thrust into diverse places. For the attendance of meeting them again
at the next Randezvous, would consume more Time and Victual, and perchance the
weak ships might be set upon, taken, or disordered, then could be spent by
recovering a Harbor, and attending the next change of wind.

That the dissevering of Fleets has been the overthrow of many Actions, I
could give many Examples, were it not in every man's Knowledge. In the last
Enterprise of worth, undertaken by our English Nation with three Squadrons of
ships, Commanded by the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Suffolk and my self,
where was also present the Earl of Southampton, If we being storme-beaten in
the Bay of Alcashar or Biscaye had had a Port under our Lee, that we might have
kept our Transporting ships with our men of War, we had in all likelihood both
taken the Indian Fleet and the Asores.

That we staid long in Ireland it is true, but they must accuse the Clouds and
not me, for our stay there; for I lost not a day of a good Wind: and there was
not any Captain of the Fleet but had Credit or might have had for a great
deal of more victuals then we spent there, and yet they had of me fifty
Beeves among them and somewhat else.

For the third Accusation, That I landed in Hostile manner at Lancerota;
Certainly Captain Baily had great want of matter when he gave that for an
excuse of his turning back, for I referr my self to Mr. Barney, who I know
will ever justify a truth, to whom (when he came to me from Captain Baily to
know whether he should land his men with the rest) I made this answer, that he
might land them if it pleased him, or otherwise keep them aboard, for I had
agreed with the Governor for a proportion of victual which I hourly expected:
And it is true, that the Governor being desirous for to speak with me with one
Gentleman with him with their Rapiers only, which I accepting, and taking with
me Leivetenant Bradshaw, we agreed: that I should send up an English Factor
(whose ship did then ride in the Road) and that whatsoever the Island could
yield should be delivered at a reasonable rate; I sent the English Factor
according to our agreement, but the Governor put it off from one morning to an
other, and in the end sent me word, that except I would imbarque my men which
lay on the Sea side, Slanders were so jealous as they durst not sever
themselves to make our Provisions: I did so, but when the one half were gotten
aboard two of our Centinells forc^, one slain and the English Factor sent to
tell me that he had nothing for us, whom he still believed to be a Fleet of
the Turks, who had lately taken and destroyed Puerto Sancto. Hereupon all the
Companies would have marched toward the Town and have sacked it, but I knew it
would not only dislike His Majesty; But that our Merchants having a continual
trade with those Islands, that their Goods would have bin stayed, and amongst
the rest, the poor English man riding in the Road having all that he brought
thither ashore, would have been utterly undone.

Hereof I complained to the Governor of the Grand Canaries, whom I also
desired that we might take water without any disturbance, but instead of
answer, when we landed some hundred men, far from any habitation, and in a
Desert place of the Island, where we found some fresh water, there Ambush was
laid, and one Fisher of Sir John Fernes ship wounded to death, and more had
been slain had not Captain Thornhurst and Master Robert Hayman my sons
Lieutenant, two exceeding valiant Gentlemen, who first made head against them,
seconded by Sir Warham Sentleger and my Son with half a dozen more, made
sorty of them run away. From hence because there was scarcity of water, we
sailed to Gomarrah, one of the strongest and well defenced places of all the
Islands and the best Port: The Town being seated upon the very Wash of the
Sea, at the first entrance of our ships, they shot at us, and ours at them, but
as soon as I my self recovered the Harbor, and had commanded that there
should be no more shooting, I sent a Spaniard a shore (taken in a Barque which
came from Cape Blanke) to tell the Governor that I had no purpose to make war
with any of the Spanish Kings Subjects, and if any harm were done by our great
Ordnance to the Town, it was his fault, which by shooting first gave the
occasion. He sent me for answer that he thought we had been the Tu^kish Fleet,
which destroyed Puerto Sancto, but being resolved by the Messenger that we were
Christians and English, and sought nothing but water, he would willingly afford
us as much as we pleased to take, if he might be assured that we would not
attempt his Towne-Houses, nor destroy the Gardens and fruits; I returned him
answer that I would give him my Faith, and the word of the King of Great
Brittaigne my Sovereign Lord, that the People of the Town and Island should
not loose so much as one Orange or a Grape without paying for it, I would hang
him up in the Market-street. Now that I kept my Faith with him, and how much he
held himself bound unto me: I have diverse of his Letters to show, for he wrote
unto me every day And the Countess being of an english Race a Stafford by
Mother, and of the house of Horn by the Father, sent me diverse presents of
fruits, Sugar, and Ruske: to whom I returned because I would not depart in her
debt) things of greater value; The old Earl at my departure wrote a Letter to
the Spanish Ambassador here in England how I had behaved my self in those
Islands. There I discharged a Bark of the grand Canaries taken by one of my
Pinnaces coming from Cape-Blank in Africa, and demanding of him what prejudice
he had recieved by being taken, he told me that my men had eaten of his fish to
the value of six Duckers, for which I gave him eight.

From the Canaries, it is said That I sailed to Cape de Verte knowing it to be
an insec^ious place, by ^eason whereof I lost so many of my men ere I recovered
the Indies; The truth sis that I came no nerer to Cape de Vert then Bravo,
which is one hundred and sixty Leagues off; But had I taken it in my way,
falling upon the Coast or any other part of Guiana, after the Rain, there is
as little danger of insection as in any other part of the World, as our English
that trade in those parts every year do well know; There are few places in
England or in the world near great Rivers which run through low grounds or
near Moorish or Marsh grounds, but the People inhabiting near, are at some
time of the year subject to Feaver^, witness Woollwich in Kent and all down the
Rivers on both sides, other Infection there is not found either in the Indies
or in Af^rica, Except it be when the Easterly wind or Breefes are kept off by
some High Mountains from the V^llies, w^erby the air wanting motion does
become exceeding unhealthfull as at Number de Dios and elsewhere. But as good
success admitts no Examination, so the contrary allows of no excuse, how
reasonable or just soever. Sir Francis Drake, Mr. John Winter and John Tomas,
when they past the Streights of Malegan, mee^ing with a storm which drove
Winter back, which thrust John Thomas upon the Islands to the South where he
was cast away, and Sir Francis nere a small Island upon which the Spaniards
landed their cheins and murderers, from Baldivia, and he found there Phillip an
Indian who told him where he was and conducted him to Baldivia, where he took
his first prize of Treasure and in that ship he found a Pylot called John Grege
who guided him all that Coast, in which he possessed himself of the rest, which
Pylot because he should not rob him of his Reputation and knowledge in those
parts (desisting the entreaties and tears of all his Company) he set him a
shore upon the Island of Altegulors to be by them devoured. After which passing
by the East Indies, he returned into England, and notwithstanding the peace
between Us and Spain, he enjoyed the Riches he brought, and was never so much
as called to account for cutting off Douly his head at Port St. Julian having
neither Marshall Law nor other Commission availeable. Mr. Candish having past
all the Coasts of Chyle and Peru, and not gotten a farthing, when he was
without hope, and re^dy to shape his course by the East homewards, met a ship
which came from the Phillippines at Calestorvia, a thousand pounds to a
Nutshell. These two in these two Voyages were the Children of Fortune, and much
honored; But when Sir Francis Drake in his last attempt might have landed at
Cruces, by the river of Chyagre within eight miles of Panama, he
notwithstanding se^ the Troops on land at Number de Dios and received the
repu^se aforesaid, he dyed for s^rrow. The same success had Candish in his
last Passage toward the Streights. I say that one and the same end they both
had, to wit Drake and Candish, when Chance had left them to the trial of their
own Virtues.

For the rest I leave to all worthy and indifferent men to judge, by what
neglect or error of mine, the Gold Mine in Guiana which I had formerly
discovered was not found and enjoyed, for after we had refreshed our selves in
Galleana, otherwise in the first discovery called Poet Howard, where we tarried
Captain Hastins, Captain Pigott, and Captain Snedall, and there recovered
the most part of our sick men. I did lmbarque six Compani^s of fifty to each
Company in five ships, to wi^, the Encounter, Commanded by Captain Whitney,
in the Conside^e by Captain Woollastone, into two ^^yboats of my own,
Commanded by Captain Samuel King, and Captain Robert Smith, In a Carvill
which Companies had for their Leaders Captain Charles Parker, Captain North,
My Son, Captain Thornhurst, Captain Penjuglous Lieutenant, and Captain
Chudlyes Lieutenant Prideux.

At the Tryangle Islands I embarked the companies for Orrenoque between which
and Calliana I lay a ground twenty four hours, and if it had not been fair
weather we had never come off the Coast, having not above two Fathom and a
half of water: Eight Leagues off from whence, I directed them for the River of
Surniama, the best part of all that Tract of land between the river Ama^o^es
and Orrenoque, there I gave them order to trim their Boats and Barges; and by
the Indians of that place to understand the state of the Spaniards in
Orrenoque, and whither they had replanted or streng^hened themselves upon the
entrances or elsewhere; and if they found any Indians there, to send in the
little flyboate or the Carvill into the river of Dis^ebecke, where they should
not fail to find Pilots for Orrenoque, for with our great ships we durst not
aproach the Coast we having been all of us a ground, and in danger of leaving
our Bands upon the shoules before we recovered the Tryangle Islands as
aforesaid; The Biggest Shipp that could Enter the River was the Encounter, who
might be brought to eleven foot water upon the Bar, we could never understand
neither by Keymis, who was the first of any Nation that had entered the maine
mouth of Orrenoque nor by any of the Masters or Mariners of our Fleet, which
had traded there ten or twelve years for Tobaccho: For the Chudley when she
came nere the Entrance, drawing but twelve foot, found her self in danger and
bore up for Trinidado.

Now whereas some of my friends have been unsatifised why I my self had not
gone up with the Companies I sent, I desire hereby to give them satisfaction,
that besides my want of health and strength, and having not recovered my long
and dangerous sickness, but was again fallen into a Relapse, my ship Stoalde
and laid a ground at seaventeene foot water, 7 Leagues of the shore, so as the
Mr. nor any of my company durst adventure to come near it, much less to fall
between the shoules on the south side of the Rivers side, and sands on the
North side called Puncto Anegado, one of the most dangerous places in all the
Indies: It was therefore resolved by us all, that the fi^e greater ships should
ride at Puncto Gallo in Trinidado, and the five lesser should enter the River,
For it Whitney and Woollaston at eleven foot lay a ground three days in
passing up, in what case had I been which drew seaventeene foot, a heavier
ship and charged with forty pieces of Ordnance, besides this impossibility,
neither would my Son nor the rest of the Captains and Gentlemen have
adventured themselves the River (having but one months Victuals and being
thrust together a hundred of them in a small Flyboate) had not I assured them
that I would stay for them at Trinidado, and that no Force should drive me
thence, except I were suncke in the Sea or set on Fire by the Spanish Gallions,
for that they would have ad^entured themselves upon any other man's word or
resolution, it were ridiculous to believe.

Having in t^is sort resolved upon our enterprise, and having given
instructions, how they should proceed before and ^f^er their entrance into
Orrenoque, Keymis having undertaken to disco^er the Mine with six or eight
persons in Sir John Fernes Shallop, I better bethinking my self and misliking
his determination gave him this order, viz.

Keymis, whereas you were resolved after your arrival into Orrenoque to pass
to the Mine with my Cosen Harbert and six musketteers, and to that end you
desired to have Sir John Fernes sh^llop, I do not allow of that course,
because you cannot Land so secretly but that some Indians on the River side may
discover you, who giving knowledge of your passage to the Spaniards you may be
cut off before you can recover your Boa^e, I do therefore advise you to suffer
the Captains and the Companies of ^^e English ^o pass up to the Westward of
the mountain Aio, from whence you have no l^sse then three mi^es to the Mine,
and to lodge and encam^e between the Spanish Town and you, if there be any
To^n near it, that being so s^^^red you may make try all what depth and br^dth
the Mine ^o^ds, and whe^^er or no it answer our ^o^es. And if you find it
Royal, and the Spaniards begin to War upon you, then let the Sergeant Major
repel them i^ i^ be in his power, and drive them as f^r ^s he can.

But if you find that the Mine be not so rich as it may persuade the holding of
it, and draw on a second supply, then shall you bring but a ba^ket or two to
satisfy his Majesty, that my design was not Imaginatory but true, though not
answerable to his Majesty's expectation, for the quantity of which I never gave
assurance, nor could.

On the other side, if you shall find that any great number of Soldiers be
newly sent into Orrenoque, as the Cassique of Caliana told us that there were,
and that the Passages be already Forced so that without manifest Peril of my
son, your self, and other Captains, you cannot pass toward the Mine, then
be well advised how you land, for I know (that a few Gentlemen excepted) what a
Scumme of men you have, and I would not for all the world receive a blow from
the Spaniards to the dishonor of our Nation; I my self for my weakness cannot
be present, neither will the Company land except I stay with the ships, the
Gallioones of Spain being daily expected. Pigott the Sergeant-Major is dead.
Sir Warrham my Leiftenant, without hope of life, and my Nephew your
Sergeant-Major now but a young man: It is therefore no your judgment that I
Rely whom I trust God will direct for the best.

Let me hear from you as soon as you can, you shall find me at Puncto Gallo
dead or alive, and if you find not my ships there, yet you shall find their
Ashes; For I will fire with the Gallioones if it come to extremity, But run
away I will never.

That these my Instructions were not followed, was not my fault, But it seems
that the Sergeant-Major, Keymis and the rest were by acci^ent forced to change
their first resolution, and that finding a Spanish town or rather a village,
set up twenty mile distant from the place where Antonio Berro the first
Governor by me taken in my first discovery who had attempted to plant to meet
some two Leagues to the Westward of the Mine: They agreed to land and encamp
between the Mine and the Town, which they did not suspect to be so near them
as it was, and meaning to rest themselves on the Rivers side ^^ll the next day,
they were in the night set upon and charged by the Spaniards, which being
unlooked for, the Common sort of them were so amazed, as had not the Captains
and some other valiant Gentlemen made a Head and encouraged the rest, they had
all been broken and cut in pieces. To repel this force putting themselves in
order, they charged the Spaniards, and following them upon their retreat they
were ready to enter the Town, ere they knew where they were, and being then
charged again by the Governor, and four or five Captains which lead their
Companies; My Son not tarrying for my Musketeers run up in the head of a
company of Pikes, where he was first shot, and pressing upon a Spanish Captain
called Erinetta with his sword; Erinetta taking the small end of his Musket in
his hand struck him on the head with the stock and feld him, whom again John
Plesington, my Sons Sergeant, thrust through with his Halbert, at which time
also the Governor Diego Palmeque and the rest of the Spanish Captains being
slain, and their Companies divided, they betook themselves into a house, or
hold adjoining to the market place, where they slew and wounded the English at
their pleasure, so as we had no way to save our selves; but by firing those
houses adjoining, which done all the Spaniards ran into the bordering Woods,
and Hills, keeping the English still waking with perpetual Alarums.

The town such as it was being in this sort possessed. Keymis prepared to
discover the Mine, which at this time he was resolved to do, as appears by
his Letter to me of his own hand writing hereafter inserted; he took with him
Captain Thornhurst, Master William Herbert, Sir John Hambden, and others, but
at his first approach near the bank where he meant to Land, he received from
the wood a vollew of shot which slew two of his Company, hurt six others, and
wounded Captain Thornhurst in the head, of the which he languished three
months after.

Keymis his LETTER Dated the eight of January from Orrenoque.
ALL things that appertain to humane condition in that proper natare and
sense, that of fate and necessity belongs unto them, makes me choose rather
with grief to let you know from me this certain truth then uncertainties from
others; which is, viz. That had not this extraordinary valor and forwardness,
which with the constant vigor of mind being in the hands of death his last
breath expressed these words. (Lord have mercy upon me and prosper your
enterprise) lead them all on, when some began to pause and recoyle shamefully:
this action had neither been attempted as it was, nor performed as it is with
his surviving honor.

This Indian Pilot whom I have sent, if there be occasion to use his service in
any thing will prove sufficient and trusty: Peter Andrews whom I have sent
with him can better certify your Lordship of the state of the town, the
plenty, the condition of our men, etc. then I can write the same.

We have the Governors servant Prisoner that waited on him in his Bedchamber,
and knows all things that concerned his Master. We find there are four
Refiners Houses in the town; the best Houses of the town. I have not seen one
piece of Coin, or Bullyon, neither Gold or Silver; a small deal of Plate only
excepted.

Captain Whitney and Woollastone are but now come to us, and now I purpose (God
willing) without delay to visit the Mine, which is not eight miles from the
town, sooner I could not go by reason of the murmurings, the discords and
vexations, wherewith the Sergeant Major is perpetually tormented and tired,
having no man to assist him but my self only, things are now in some
reasonable order, and so soon as I have made trial of the Mine, I will seek
to come to your Lordship, by the way of the River. To go and to search the
Channels (that if it be possible) our Ships may shorten their course for
Trinidado, when time serves, by those passages; I have sent your Lordship a
parcel of scattered papers (I reserve a Carte Load) one roll of Tobacco, one
Tortoyse, and some Oranges and Limmons, praying God to give you strength and
health of body, and a mind armed against all extreamities. I rest ever to be
commanded

this 8. of January, 1617. Your Lordships KEYMIS.


Now it seems that the death of my Son, fearing also (as he told me when he
came to Trinidado) that I was either dead of my first sickness, or that the
news of my Sons death would have hastened my end, made him resolve not to
open the Mine, to the which he added for excuse, and I think it was true, that
the Spaniards being gone off in a whole body, lay in the Woods between the
Mine and their passage, that it was impossible, except they had bin beaten out
of the Country, to pass up the Woody and Craggy Hills without the loss of
those Commanders which should have lead them, who had they been slain, the
rest, would easily enough have bin cut in pieces in their retreat; for being
in possession of the town, which they guarded with the greatest part of three
Companies, they had yet their handful to defend themselves from fireing, and
the daily and nightly Alarums, wherewith they were vexed. He also gave forth
the excuse that it was impossible to lodge any Companies at the Mine, for want
of Victual, which from the town they were not able to carry up the mountain
their Companies being divided; He therefore as he told me thought it a greater
error to discover it to the Spaniards, themselves neither being able to work
it, nor possess it then to excuse himself to the Company, said that he could
not find it; all which his fancies when I received, and before diverse of the
Gentlemen disavowed his ignorance, for I told him That a blind man might find
it, by the marks which himself had set down under his hand, and that I told him
that his care of loosing so many men in passing through the Woods, was but
fained, for after my Son was slain, I knew that he had no care at all of any
man surviving, and therefore had he brought to the King but one hundred weight
of the oar though with the loss of one hundred men, He had given his Majesty
satisfaction, preserved my reputation, and given our Nation encouragement to
have returned this next year, with greater force and to have held the Country
for his Majesty to whom it belonged, and of which himself had given the
testimony, that besides the excellent air, pleasantness, healthfulnesse, and
riches: it has plenty of Corn, Fruits, Fish, Foul, wild and tame, Beeves,
Horses, Sheep, Hogs, Deeres, Coneys, Hares, Tortoyses, Armadiles, Wanaes,
Oils, Honey, Wax, Potatoes, Sugar Canes, Medicaments, Balsamum, Simples, Gums,
and what not; but seeing he had followed his own advice, and not mine, I
should be forced to leave him arguments with the which if he could satisfy his
Majesty, and the State, I should be glad of it, though for my part he must
excuse me to justify it, that he, if it had pleased him, though with some loss
of men might have gone directly to the place: with that he seemed greatly
discontent, and so he continued diverse days; afterward he came to me in my
Cabin, and showed me a Letter which he had written to the Earl of Arundell, to
whom he excused himself, for not discovering of the Mine: using the same
arguments, and many others which he had done before, and prayed me to allow of
his Apology; but I told him that he had undone me by his obstinacy, and that I
would not favor or color in any sort his former folly. He then asked me,
whether that were my resolution, I answered, that it was: he then replied in
these words, I know not then Sir what course to take; and went out of my Cabin
into his own, in which he was no sooner entered, but I heard a Pistol go off.
I sent up (not suspecting any such thing as the killing of himself) to know
who shot a Pistol, Keymis himself made answer lying on his Bed, that he had
shot it off, because it had been long charged, with which I was satisfied; some
half hour after this, the Boy going into his Cabin, found him dead, having a
long knife thrust under his left pap through his heart, and his Pistol lying
by him, with which it appeared that he had shot himself, but the Bullet
lighting upon a rib, had but broken the rib and went no further. Now he that
knew Keymis, did also know that he was of that obstinate resolution, and a man
so far from caring to please or satisfy any man but my self, as no man's
opinion from the greatest to the least could have persuaded him to have laid
violent hands on himself, neither would he have done it, when he did it, could
he have said unto me, that he was ignorant of the Place, and knew no such Mine;
for what cause had I then to to have rejected his excuses, or to have laid his
obstinacy to his charge; thus much I have added, because there are some Puppies
which have given it out, that Keymis slew himself because he had seduced so
many Gentlemen and others with an imaginary Mine; but as his Letter to me the
8. of January proves that he was then resolved to open it, and to take off all
these kinds of objections; Let Captain Charles Parker, Captain George Ralegh
and Captain King all living and in England; be put to their oaths whether or
no Keymis did not confess to them coming down the River, at a place where
they cast anchor, that he could from that place have gone to the Mine in two
hours, I say then that if the opening of the Mine had bin at that time to any
purpose; or had they had had any victuals left then, to bring them away, or
had they not been hastened by seeing the King of Spaines Letters before they
came to my hands, which I am assured Keymis had seen who delivered them to me,
whereof one of them was dated at Madrill the 17 of March before I left the
River of Thames, and with it, three other dispatches with a Commission for the
strengthening of Orrenoque with 150 Soldiers, which should have come down the
River from the new Kingdom of Granada; and one other 150 from Puerto Rico with
ten pieces of Ordnance which should have come up the River from the entrance,
by which two Troops they might have bin enclosed, I say had not the rest seen
those dispatches; and that having stayed in the River above two months, they
feared the hourly arrival of those forces, why had they not constrained
Keymis to have brought them to the Mine, being as himself confesses within two
hours march. Again, had the Companies Commanders but pincht the Governors
man whom they had in their possession, he could have told them of two or three
Gold Mines and a Silver Mine not above four miles from the Town, and given
them the names of their possessors; with the reason why they forbear to work
them at that time, and when they left off from working them, which they did
as well because they wanted Negroes, as because they feared least the English,
French, or Dutch would have forced them from those being once thoroughly
opened, having not sufficient strength to defend themselves; But to this, I
have heard it said since my return, that the Governors man was by me
persuaded, being in my power, to say that such Mines there were, when indeed
there was no such thing, Certainly they were but silly fools, that discovered
this subtilty of Mine, who having not yet by the long Calenture that weakened
me, lost all my wits which I must have done, if I had left my reputation in
trust with a Malato, who for a pot or two of Wine, for a dozen of Hatchets, or
a gay suite of apparel would have confessed, that I had taught him to speak
of Mines, that were not in Rerum natura, No I protest before the Majesty of
God, that without any other agreements or promises of mine, then well usage, he
has discovered to me, the way to five or six of the richest Mines which the
Spaniards have, and from whence, all the Mass of Gold that comes into Spain
in effect is drawn.

Lastly, when the Ships were come down the River as far as Carapana's
Country (who was one of the natural Lords) and one that reserved that part of
Guiana to her Maje. hearing that the English had abandoned St. Thome, and left
no force in the Country, which he hoped they would have done, he sent a great
Canooe with store of fruits and Provisions to the Captains, and by one of his
men which spoke Spanish, having as it seemed bin long in their hands; he
offered them a rich Gold Mine in his own Country, knowing it to be the best
argument to persuade their stay, and if it please them to send up any one of
the English to view it, he would leave sufficient pledges for his safe return.
Master Leake, Master Moleneux and others offering themselves, which when the
greater part refused (I know not by what reason lead) he sent again, leaving
one of his men still aboard to entreat them to tarry but two days, and he
himself would come to them, and bring them a sample of the oar: for he was an
exceeding old man, when I was first in the Country some twenty four years
since, which being also neglected, and the Ships under sail; he not
withstanding sent a Boat after them to the very mouth of the River in hope to
persuade them: that this is true, witness Captain Parker, Captain Leake,
Master Stresham, Master Maudict, Master Moleneux, Master Robert Hamon, Master
Nicholes, Captain King, Peter Andrews, and I know not how many others; but
besides his offer also, there has not been wanting an argument though a
foolish one; which was that the Spaniards, had employed the Indians with a
purpose to betray our men, but this treason had been easily prevented, if they
had stayed the old man's coming; who would have brought them the Gold oar
aboarde their Ships, and what purpose could there be of treason when the
Guianians offered to leave pledges six for one, yea one of the Indians which
the English had aboarde them, whom they found in fetters when they took the
town of St. Thome could have told them, that the Cassique which sent unto them
to show them the Gold Mine in his Country, was unconquered; and are enemies to
the Spaniard, and could also have assured them, that this Cassique had Gold
Mines in his Country.

I say then, that if they would neither force Keymis to go to the Mine, when
he was by his own confession, within two hours march of it; to examine from
whence these two Ingots of Gold which they brought me, were taken, which they
found laid by for Kings quinto or fifth part; or those small pieces of Silver,
which had the same marks and stamps; if they refused to send any one of the
Fleet into the Country to see the Mines which the Cassique Carapana offered
them; if they would not vouchsafe to stay two days for the coming of Carapana
himself, who would have brought them a sample of the Gold oar, I say, that,
there is no reason ^o lay it to my charge, that I carried them with a pretense
of Gold, when neither Keymis nor my self knew of any in those parts: if it had
bin to have gotten my liberty, why did I not keep my liberty when I had it, Nay
why did I put my life in manifest peril to forgo it? if I had had a purpose to
have turned Pyrate, why did I oppose my self against the greatest number of my
Company, and was there by in danger to be slain or cast into the Sea because I
refused it?

A strange fancy had it been in me to have persuaded my Son whom I have lost,
and to have persuaded my Wife to have adventured the 8000. l. which his Majesty
gave them for Sherbone, and when that was spent, to persuade my Wife to sell
her house at Micham, in hope of enriching them by the Mines of Guiana; if I my
self had not seen them with my own eyes; for being old and weakly, thirty
years in prison, and not used to the air to travel and to watching, it being
ten to one that I should ever have returned, and to which by reason of my
violent sickness, and the long continuance thereof, no man had any hope, what
madness could have made me undertake this journey but the assurance of the
Mine, thereby to have done his Majesty service, to have bettered my Country by
the trade, and to have restored my Wife and Children their States; they had
lost for that, I have refused all other ways or means, for that I had a purpose
to have changed my Master, and my Country, my return in the state I did
return may satisfy every honest and indifferent man.

An unfortunate man I am, and it is to me a greater loss then all I have lost,
that it pleases his Majesty to be offended for the burning of a Spanish town
in Guiana; of which these parts bordering the River Orrenoque, and to the South
as far as the Amazones does by the Law of Na^ions belong to the Crown of
England, as his Majesty was well resolved when I prepared to go thither,
otherwise his Majesty would not have given once leave to have landed there; for
I set it down under my hand that I intended that enterprise and nothing else,
and that I meant to enter the Country by the River of Orrenoque; It was not
held to be a breach of peace neither by the State here nor the Spanish
Ambassador who knew it as well as I, that I pretended the journey of Guiana
which he always held to be a pretense; for he said it to Master Secretary
Windode and to others of my Lords; that if I meant to sail to Guiana, and had
no intent to invade any part of his Majesty's West Indies nor his Fleets, I
should not need to strengthen my self as I did, for I should work any Mine
there, without any disturbance and in peace, to which I made answer, that I had
set it under my hand to his Majest. that I had no other purpose, nor meant to
undertake any thing else; but for the rest, that Sir John Haukins in his
journey, to St. John de Loa, notwithstanding that he had leave of the Spanish
King to trade in all parts of the West Indies, and having the Plate Fleet in
his power, did not take out of it one ounce of Silver, but kept his faith and
promise in all places, was set upon by Don Henrico de Martines whom he suffered
(to save him from perishing) to enter the Port; upon Martins faith, and
enterchanged pledges delivered, he had Jesus of Lubeck a Ship of her Majesty's
of a 1000 tun burnt; had his men slain which he left on the Land; lost his
Ordnance, and all the treasure which he had got by Trade; what reason had I to
go unarmed upon the Ambassadors promises, whose words and thoughts that they
were one, it has well appeared since then, as well by the forces which he
persuaded his Master to send to Guiana to encounter me, and cut me off there;
as by his persecuting of me since my return; who have neither invaded his
Masters Indies, nor his Fleet, whereof he stood in doubt.

True it is, that the Spaniards cannot endure that the English Nation should
look upon any part of America, being above a fourth part of the whole known
world; and the hundred part neither possessed by the Spaniards, nor to them
known, as Acosta the Jesuit in his description of the West Indies does
confess, and well know to be true: No though the King of Spain can pretend no
other title to all that he has not conquered, then the Popes donation; for
from the straits of Megellan to the river of Plate, being a greater territory
then all that the Spaniards possess in Peru or Chile, and from Cape St.
Augustines to Trinidado being a greater ex^ent of Land then all which he
possesses in Nova Spain, or elsewhere, they have not one foot of ground in
their possession, neither for the greatest part of it so much as in their own
knowledge.

In Orrenoque they have lately set up a Wooden Town, and made a kind of a
Forte, but they have never been able either to Conquer the Guianians; nor to
reconcile them, but the Guianians before their planting, they did willingly
resign all that territory to her Majesty, who by me promised to receive them,
and defend them against the Spaniards; and though I were a Prisoner for this
last fourteen years, yet I was at the charge every year, or every second
year, to send unto them to keep them in hope of being relieved. And as I have
said before the greatest of the natural Lords, did offer us a rich Mine of
Gold in his own Country in hope to hold us there; And if this usurped
possession of the Spaniards be a sufficient bar to his Majesty's right; and
that thereby the King of Spain calls himself King of Guiana, why might he not
as well call himself Duke of Britain, because he took possession of
Blewett, and built a Forte there; and calls himself King of Ireland; because
he took possession at Smerike and built a Forte there.

If the Ambassador had protested to his Majesty that my going to Guiana before
I went would be a breach to the peace, I am persuaded that his Majesty if he
had not bin resolved that Guiana had been his would have stayed me, but if it
be not thought to be a breach of Peace not for the going thither (for that
cannot be) because I had no other intent, and went with leave; but for taking
and burning of a Spanish town in the Country, certainly, if the Country be the
King of Spains, it had been no less a breach of Peace to have wrought any Mine
of his, and to have robbed him of his Gold; then it is now cald'd a breach of
peace to take a town of his in Guiana and burn it, and with as good reason
might I have bin called a thief and a robber of the King of Spain, if the
Country be not his Majesty's, as I am now pursued for the Invasion; for either
the Country is the King of Spains or not the Kings; if it be the Kings, I have
not then offended; if it be not the Kings, I must have perished, if I had but
taken Gold out of the Mines there, though I had found no Spaniards in the
Country.

For conclusion, if we had had any peace with the Spaniards in those parts of
the world; why did even those Spaniards, which were now encountered in Guiana,
tie six and thirty English men out of Master Walls Ship of London and mine back
to back, and cut their throats, after they had traded with them a whole month,
and came to them a shore; having not so much as a sword, or any other weapon,
among them all, and if the Spaniards to our complaints made answer, that there
was nothing in the treat against our trading in the Indies, but that we might
trade at our peril; I trust in God that the word peril shall ever be
construed to be indifferent to both Nations; otherwise we must for ever abandon
the Indies, and loose all our knowledge, and our Pylotage of that part of the
world: if we have no other peace then this; how can there be a breach of peace,
which e're the Spaniards with all Nations, and all Nations with them may trade
upon their guard?

The readiest way that the Spaniards Ambassador could have taken, to have
stayed me from going to Guiana; had bin to have discovered the great practices
which I had with his Master against the King my Sovereign Lord in the first
year of his Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, for which I lost my estate
and lay thirteen years in the Tower of London, and not to urge my offenses in
Guiana; to which his Master has no title other then his sword, is with which
to this day, he has not conquered the least of these Nations, and against whom
contrary to the Catholic profession, his Captains have entertained, and do
entertain whole Nations of Canniballs; for in a Letter of the Governors to
the King of Spain of the eighth of July: he not only complains that the
Guianians are in Arms against him, but that ever those Indians which under
their noses live, do in despite of all the Kings edicts trade with Los
Flamnicos and Engleses, enemicos, With the Flemish, and English enemies, never
once naming the English Nations but with the Epitheton of an enemy.

But in truth the Spanish Ambassador has complained against me to no other
end, then to prevent my complaints against the Spaniards. Who landing my men in
a territory appertaining to the Crown of England; they were invaded and slain
before any violence offered to the Spaniards; and I hope that the Ambassador
does not esteem us for so wretched and miserable a people, as to offer our
throats to their swords without any manner of resistance; howsoever, I have
said it already, and I will say it again; that if Guiana be not his Majesty's,
the working of a Mine there; and the taking of a town there; had been equally
perilous, for by doing the one, I had robbed the King of Spain and bin a
thief; and by the other a disturber or breaker of the peace.

A Letter of Sir WALTER RAWLEIGH to my Lord Carevv touching Guiana.
BEcause I know not whether I shall live, to come before the Lords, I have for
his Majesty's satisfaction here set down as much as I can say, either for mine
own defense, or against my self, as things are now construed.

It is true, that though I acquainted his Majesty with my intent to Land in
Guiana, yet I never made it known to his Majesty that the Spaniards had any
footing there; neither had I any authority by Patent, to remove them from
thence, and therefore his Majesty had no interest in the attempt of Saint Thome
by any foreknowledge in his Majesty.

But knowing his Majesty's title to the Country to be best, and most Christian,
because the natural Lords did most willingly acknowledge Queen Elizabeth to
be their Sovereign, who by me promised to defend them from the Spanish
cruelty, I made no doubt but I might enter the Land by force, seeing the
Spaniards had no other title but force, (the Popes donation excepted)
considering also that they had got a possession there diverse years since my
possession for the Crown of England, for were not Guiana his Majesty's, then
might I as well have bin questioned for a thief, for taking the Gold out of the
King of Spains Mines, as the Spaniards do now call me a peace breaker; for,
from any territory that belongs to the King of Spain, it is no more lawful to
take Gold, then lawful for the Spaniards to take Tin out of Cornwall, were
this possession of theirs a sufficient Bar to his Majesty's Right, the Kings of
Spain may as well call themselves Dukes of Britain, because they held Blewet,
and fortified there; and Kings of Ireland because they possessed Smereck and
fortified there, and so in other places.

That his Majesty was well resolved of his right there, I make no kind of
doubt, because the English both under Master Charles Leigh and Master Harecourt
had leave to plant and inhabit the Country.

The Orrenoque it self, had long ere this had 5000. English in it, I assure my
self, had not my employment at Cales, the next year after my return from
Guiana, and after that our journey to the Islands hindered me, for those two
years after with Tirones Rebellion, made her Majesty unwilling that any great
number of Ships or men should be taken out of England, till that rebellion were
ended, and lastly, her Majesty's death, my long imprisonment gave time to the
Spaniards to set up a town of sticks covered with leaves of trees upon the
bank of Orronoque, which they call St. Thome, but they have neither reconciled
nor Conquered any of the Cassiques or natural Lords of the Country, which
Cassiques are still in arms against them, as by the Governors Letter to the
King of Spain, may appear: That by landing in Guiana there can be any breach
of peace, I think it (under favor) impossible, for to break peace where
there is no peace, it cannot be; that the Spaniards give us no peace there, it
does appear by the Kings Letters to the Governor, that they should put to
death all those Spaniards and Indians that trade, Con los Engleses Enemigos
with English enemies: yea those very Spaniards which we encountered at St.
Thome, did of late years murder six and thirty of Master Hales men of London,
and mine, who landed without weapon, upon the Spaniards faith to trade with
them, Master Thorn also in Tower-street in London besides many other English
were in like sort murdered in Orrenoque, the year before my deliverie out of
the Tower.

Now if this kind of trade be peaceable, there is then a peaceable trade in the
Indies, between us and the Spaniards, but if this be cruel War and hatred,
and no peace, then there is no peace broken by our attempt; Again, how does it
stand with the greatness of the King of Spain, first to call us enemies, when
he did hope to cut us in pieces, and then having failed, to call us peace
breakers: for to be an enemy and a peace breaker in one and the same action is
impossible.

But the King of Spain in his Letters to the Governor of Guiana, dated at
Madrill the 29 of March, before we left the Thames, calls us Engleses enemigos,
English enemies.

If it had pleased the King of Spain to have written to his Majest. in seven
months time, for we were so long in preparing, and have made his Majesty know,
that our landing in Guiana would draw after it a breach of peace, I presume to
think, that his Majesty would have stayed our enterprise for the present.

This he might have done with less charge, then to leavy three hundred
soldiers and transport ten pieces of Ordnance from Portarico, which soldiers
added to the Garrison of St. Thome: had they arrived before our coming, had
overthrown all our raw companies, and there would have followed no complaints.

For the maine point of landing near St. Thome, it is true, that we were of
opinion, that we must have driven the Spaniards out of the town, before we
could pass the thick woods upon the mountains of the Mine, which I confess I
did first resolve upon, but better bethinking my self, I reserved the taking
of the town, to the goodness of the Mine, which if they found to be so rich,
as it might persuade the leaving of the Garrison, then to drive the Spaniards
thence, but to have burnt was never my intent, neither could they give me any
reason why they did it, upon their return I examined the Serjeant-Major and
Keymis why they followed not my last directions for the trial of the Mine
before the taking of the town, and they answered me, that although they durst
hardly, go to the Mine leaving a Garrison of Spaniards, between them and their
Boats, yet they offended their latter directions, and did Land, between the
town and the Mine.

And that the Spaniards without any manner of parley set upon them unawares,
and charged them, calling them Perros Ingleses, and by Skirmishing with them,
they drew them on to the very entrance of the town before they knew where they
were, so that if any peace had bin in those parts, the Spaniards first brake
the peace, and made the first slaughter, for as the English could not but Land
to seek the Mine, being come thither to that end, so being first reviled, and
charged by the Spaniards, they could do no less then repel force by force;
lastly it is a matter of no small consequence to acknowledge that we have
offended the King of Spain by landing in Guiana.

For first it weakens his Majesty's title to the Country or quits it; Secondly,
there is no King that has ever given the least way to any other King or State
in the traffic of the lives or goods of his Subjects, to wit in our case, that
it shall be lawful for the Spaniards tomurther us, either by force or treason,
and unlawful for us to defend our selves and pay them with their own Coin,
for this superiority and inferiority is a thing which no absolute Monarch ever
yielded to, or ever will.

Thirdly, it shows the English bears greater respect to the Spaniard, and is
more doubtful of his forces, then either the French or Dutch is, who daily
invade all parts of the Indies with not being questioned at their return, yea
at my own being at Plymouth, a French Gentleman called Flory went thence with
four sail, and three hundred Land men, with Commission to land and burn, and
to sack all places in the Indies that he could master, and yet the French King
has married the daughter of Spain.

This is all that I can say, other then that I have spent my poor estate, lost
my son, and my health, and endured as many sorts of miseries, as ever man
did, in hope to do his Majesty acceptable service; And have not to my
understanding committed any hostile act, other then entrance upon a territory
belonging rightly to the Crown of England, where the English were first set
upon and slain by the usurping Spaniards, I invaded no other parts of the
Indies, pretended by the Spaniards.

I returned into England with manifest peril of my life, with a purpose not to
hold my life, with any other then his Majesty's grace, and from which no man,
nor any peril could dissuade me; To that grace, and goodness, and Kinglynesse
I refer my self, which if it shall find that I have not yet suffered enough,
it yet may please to add more affliction to the remainder of a wretched life.


Sir Walter Rawleigh his Answer to some things at his Death.
I Did never receive any direction from my Lord Carew to make any escape, nor
did I ever tell Stukely any such thing. I did never name my Lord Hay and my
Lord Carew to Stukeley in other words or sense, then to my honorable friends,
among other Lords. I did never show unto Stukely any Letter, wherein there was
10000 named or any one pound, only I told him, that I hoped to procure the
payment of his debts in his absence. I never had Commission from the French
King, I never saw the French Kings hand or seal in my life. I never had any
plot or practice with the French directly or indirectly, nor with any other
Prince or State unknown to the King. My true intent was to go to a Mine of
Gold in Guiana, it was not fained, but it is true, that such a Mine there is
within three miles of St. Thome, I never had in my thought to go from
Trinidado, and leave my Companies to come after to the savage Island, as Hatby
Fearne has falsely reported. I did not carry with me an hundred pieces, I had
with me sixty, and brought back near the said number, I never spoke to the
French Manering any one disloyal word, or dishonorable speech of the King;
nay if I had not loved the King truly, and trusted in his goodness somewhat
too much, I know that I had not new suffered death.

These things are most true as there is a God, and as I am now to appear
before his tribunal seat, where I renounce all mercy, and salvation, if this
be not the truth. At my death

W. R.

FINIS.
