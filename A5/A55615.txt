A Practical Consideration OF THE SAINTS SONSHIP.

In a Discourse upon the fourth Chapter of the Galatians, verse. 6.

London, Printed by Robert Ibbitson, 1656.

A Practical Consideration of the Saints Sonship.
GAL. 4.6. And because ye are Sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son
in your hearts, crying Abba Father.


THe Apostle having showed the poor and mean condition the Law rendered us in,
holds out the glory of our condition under the Gospel, in the consideration of
our Sonship, we being by our Lords coming, freed from that pupillage and
bondage we were before held under, that we might receive the adoption of
Sons, and being redeemed thereunto, receive the spirit, and all good things
as a consequent of such a state.

These words do acquaint us in the general scope of them with this great truth,
that it is not any Grace in us, or works done by us: That first brings us into
that state of the Gospel, wherein we have favor and acceptance with God, but
God first appoints us unto such a state, and thereupon gives us Grace suitable
unto it Because ye are Sons, Because God has in Christ appointed you to
such a glorious estate, therefore is the spirit of his Son, and all good
things given unto you, although I might speak much of this, yet I intend to
confine my self to the observing only this one truth.

Doct, That the state of a Christian under the Gospel, is a state of Sonship.

We find in our natural state we are absolute enemies unto God, under the
Law we come but to be servants, but under the Gospel we become sons.

We bear herein a proportion with the Lord Christ our head, who is not as
Moses was, a servant in Gods house, but he is a Son, he is the Son in his own
house, and therefore his brethren are Sons, that Sonship that he has from
the Father, it carries their Sonship in it: As he in his humanity became like
them in all things, sin only excepted, so are they in their conformity, made
like him in all things, save wherein he is their Savior and their head, and
as they have one common image to both, so have they one principle and root, for
the Apostle tells us, that our life is hid with Christ in God, that is the
Saints life, and is hid together with Christ's life in God, he is the fountain
of both their lives: This comprehends in a word, the excellent Grace and glory
of the Gospel, that such poor remote wretches from God, such strangers and
enemies as we are, should become Sons, should he born of God in Christ, and
inherit freely all his grace and glory; the Apostle seems to make a stop, and
admire at this, Behold says he, what manner of love the father has showed
unto us, that we should be called the Sons of God! It Is not only a thing of
admirable advantage, but of astonishing honor; could David think it a great
matter to be a Kings Son in Law, and shall not we, value this high calling
of God in Christ Jesus?

To be his sons, the Apostle speaks of this; as the highest thing we can
attain to in this life, now says he we are the sons of God: we find in
Scripture, the Lord pleasing to afford this title three ways, first, and
principally to Christ, he is always called the Son, and somewhat more, the
only begotten Son of the father, none ever begotten as he was, first, in
respect of his eternal essence, wherein he is the eternal Son, and secondly,
in respect of his humanity, and manhood, and his headship therein to both
creations, he being so begotten, the spring of all natural life and being, and
the head of his body the Church: we find also the Angels called the Sons of
God, and in Job 38.7. when the morning Stars sang together, and all the sons of
God shouted for joy; speaking of the Angels, and in Luke 3.38. Adam is called
the son of God.

This is in reference unto their first creation, and lastly, in this Gospel
sense, this honor have all the Saints, to be called Sons, and this their son
ship through and in Christ, the only son, is far more excellent, than that of
the Angels; or of Adams, the root of Adams state and glory lay in himself, and
so being mutable, he of a Son created, became a fallen depraved bitter enemy,
this is unchangeably fixed; and growing daily to perfection, it is more excellent
than that of the Angels, in as much as it is wrought and arises (to the
exceeding glory of free grace) out of enmity, darkness, and a fallen state;
which they were never in, and secondly, as it is in Christ the head of this
Sonship, exalted above the Angels in the excellency and glory of it.

There be two questions, may be fitly resolved in this place.

1 How come we to this estate, and then wherein does it consist? 2 How stood
the Saints under the Law in the old Testament in reference to it.
For the first question, we come to this state by Christ's purchase alone, we
receive it from God through him, and it has its root in him, he dispenses it
to us, him has God the father sealed for this purpose, this we see in Joh.
1.12. But to as many as received him; to them he gave power, or dignity, to
become the Sons of God. It consists in this, that our Lord Christ by what he
has in his own person done, has taken from us the yoke of the first covenant,
and of the Law, under which we were as strangers, and so dealt withal, and
has obtained a right for us to this state of Sonship, and neerness to God,
wherein we freely inherit life and salvation, he has broken down the
partition wall of sin and gilt, that was between God and man, by reason of his
inability to fulfill the righteousness of the Law, and having satisfied that,
and nailed the condemning power thereof upon his cross, he brings man that
was so far off, thus near unto God, and makes him look upon God, no more as
an infinite being, who is a law giver only and a judge, but now in him become a
most affectionate tender father, and brings God who was thus in Christ
reconciling himself to the world, to be no more as at a distance, but near and
one with the Creature as a Father, and in the dearest and nearest relations,
God is become in Christ a Father, and we his children, our maker, our husband,
and we his Spouse, and so we are brought into this blessed state, wherein God
deals with us as Sons, with all love, sweetness, and familiarity.

And lastly, That which makes this right of Sonship, which Christ has so
purchased and obtained, effectual, and gives us the possession of it, is God
gives us the spirit of his Son, Christ's Sonship is as it were communicated
unto us, and so we have not only a right of Sonship in Christ, but through
him the spirit of sons to apply to God as a Father, and we are not only under
an outward administration of Sonship, wherein we should be sure still to
retain the mind and spirit of servants, and enemies, but have the hearts and
spirits of Sons given unto us, and are by this effectual provsion of the Lord,
no more in a spirit of bondage unto fear, but of power and love and of a sound
mind.

And thus our Lord has redeemed us into the same state with himself, he being
a Son, we are so too.

To the second question, what enjoyment the Saints under the Law had of this
privilege, my Answer is, they then had this state of Sonship in faith, but
not in possession until the fullness of time came, they had a right to it, as
we use to say, but not in it, the administration of the Law bowed down their
backs, they were at School under tutors and governors, they did not receive
this Adoption of Sons: As heaven is now to us, so was this state to them, we
have a right to it, and have it by faith, yet stand obliged to the duties of
our present administration in this life, so they had a right to this Adoption
of Sons by the son, and saw it and hoped for it a far off, but lay obliged
under the elements of the world, and were shut up under the Law, till the time
appointed by their and our Father, this better thing being kept for the Saints
in these days, that they without us might not be perfect.

This Doctrine of the Saints sonship, being every where in the Scriptures
witnessed unto, I shall improve it these two ways.

First, By way of Use, and then by way of Trial, whether we be in possession
of this state or not?

First, And first if the Saints be now sons, it is a shame to those, who by a
Legal carnal Ministry, seek to make servants and slaves of them, this they do
who set up works, and impose that yoke which our fathers were not able to bear,
who so urge the commands of the gospel, as that they turn it into a mere
Covenant of works, and revive again the dead body of Moses, which God himself
has buried, and so erect a worldly Sanctuary, as if Christ were not ascended
and become a minister of the sanctuary, and true tabernacle; who brings the
Conscience into bondage, in those things wherein Christ has made his people
free, who set the Saints to obtain that by works, and conditions, which they
have by their sonship, by inheritance, this is the Devils constant design to
scar men from the Gospel, by obscuring that glorious life and spirit that is
brought therein to light, and if he cannot overthrow the state of those that
have received it, to raise up Doctrins to make their course as wearisome, and
as full of bondage as he can, and therefore we need often to read that advise
of the Apostle, in Gal. 5.1. stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has
made you free. etc.

Secondly, The second use may be this; if we are sons, do we walk like sons
of the most high? are we filial toward God in our conversation, are we as
obedient Children, not fashioned to this world, if he say come, do we come,
and if he say go, do we go, are we at a beck, waiting to be disposed and
directed by him, and do we follow his commands as dear children, without
murmuring and without disputing? if we do not, if we profess God to be our
father, may not he say to us, if I am your Father where is my honor, the
sovereignty of God may require our obedience from us, but how much more should
the consideration of him as a father beget it in us, what the greatness of God
will not do, surely his goodness should not fail of; Can there be opposition
unto kindness, the infinite God takes that way to overcome us poor worms, if
God will own himself our father, it is equal sure we should behave our selves
like his children, and if he be our father, should we not show forth his
image, if we rightly consider it, what greater privilege imaginable, what
greater blessedness then to bear the glorious image of our Creator, thus
manifested in Christ; who should do it, if his sons, his children should not?
we are kept in the world for this purpose, to bear forth his virtues, and his
praises before the blind world, were it not for this work that is to be done,
he would soon take us to himself in the heavens.

What a great shame and dishonor is it unto the Lord, to profess our selves
his sons, and yet walk in an earthy, sensual, devilish spirit; lets show some
tokens of our country, and of our fathers house; lets carry some badge of a
heavenly extraction, we have born the Image of the earthy plain enough. O lets
bear the Image of the heavenly, we are plainly Adams sons in nature, lets
appear sons of God in grace; How glorious, how convincing would be the life of
a Christian, if he did show forth the Image of his father, whose tender
mercies are over all his works, who causes his Sun to shine on the just, and
the unjust, who when he bids us forgive till seventy times seven, it is but that
we might be like him our heavenly father, who in that patience and goodness,
and forbearance, and easiness to be entreated, which he shows to us, is a
pattern what we should do one toward another, when ever a christian
miscarries, it is stepping aside from his Fathers Image, this is that end
concerning man, God has proposed to himself and been about, by the Law, by the
Prophets, by the Gospel, by all, as the way to make him happy, and a fit object
for his converse; to stamp his own image upon him.

Thirdly, Every Christian know your state, thou art a son, though but a babe in
the Gospel, we are sons aad heirs, and joint heirs with Christ, most
Christians loose much of their comfort and strength by this, they consider not
the relation which in Christ God and man stand in together, they live only in
the comfort of their graces, and not of their state; A man may think easily too
much of himself, that is the error very many are in, and he may also think too
low of himself, the devil is not without his devises that way too.

A man can never be debased enough as in himself, and yet he may exalt
himself in that estate which God has in Christ appointed him unto, we may thus
glory in the Lord; Let not the Devil nor our unbeleeving hearts ever remove us
from this, we are sons, though Prodigals, let this consideration help to
recover us out of temptation, when we sit darkness, and see no light: Lets
think our selves too good to be feeding amongst the dogs, and the swine of this
world: Lets think our selves of too noble a quality and birth, to be made
slaves by Satan, and captived at his will, or to be servants unto men, and to
be in bondage unto them, or to become drudges to dirty unsatiable lusts. We are
bought with a price, the blood of out dearest Lord, unto Sonship, and unto
spiritual freedom; lets not be like profane Esau; lets not part with it upon
any terms, there is nothing under the Sun can be a price for it.

Fourthly, If we are sons, Lets go to God always as to our Father, lets treat
with him more intimately and freely, than a man would do with his friend: And
acquaint him with all our wants and griefs, as knowing him properly concerned
therein, and bury all our cares in his bosom.

How sweet will our communion be with him, if whenever we come to call upon
him, we bring this settled apprehension with us, that he is our father, the
reason why we often miscarry in the comfort of our prayers, it is, because we
think but randomly of him, according to what our present temper is, we frame
out imaginations of God, of what we find in our selves, the prodigal he
recovered himself with this, says he, I Will go to my Father, if he be my
Father, there is my hope, though I have never so much misbehaved my self: it is
hard to find a case that a Fathers heart on earth will not be stirred toward
his son, but if that should be, twill never be so with our Father which is in
heaven, we can no sooner make toward him, but he will meet us; whilst we are
a far off, and embrace us, and take us home; let our Lord herein be a
pattern to us, who whilst he conversed in this lower world, would ever keep up
this claim to God to be his Father: the meannesse of his condition, nor the
Jews threats to stone him for it, never made him let go the owning of this
relation: O take heed of nourishing up hard thoughts of God! it is the ground of
all Apostasy: if you pray not to God as your Father, you will not pray to him
long at all, you will take the first opportunity to quit his service, you will
do nothing but to stop the mouth of a hungry gnawing conscience: the more you
think of him, the more you will be troubled: All approaches to God under any
other apprehension but this, will but awaken terror, and multiply guilt before
your face: O remember therefore our Lord has taught us to begin all our
approaches unto God, with calling him Our Father.

This term will make all our guilt to vanish, and bury it out of our sight, and
drive away our sins as a thick cloud, and make all those considerations of his
greatness, and his majesty sweet unto us.

Fifthly, if God be our Father, why doubt we of being provided for, can those
that have such a father want? why take we so much care, why do we seek an
inheritance in the world? does not our Father know what we want of these
things: Lets not choose for our selves, but let him provide for us, he takes
care of the Lilies, and he feeds the Ravens, and shall his children want?
Shall Christ's seed be unprovided for? Paul tells us, it is the Fathers work to
provide for the children: How unbecomming a thing is it, for a man that calls
God his Father, to seek help any where else; remember that good man, who was
ashamed to ask a troop of horse of the King, because he had named the name of
the Lord: Never apply but to the Lord, if you ask him bread, he will not give
you a stone, and if you ask him a fish, he will not give you a Scorpion, in
our Fathers house there is bread enough: And lets be content with the portion
our Father gives us, he loves us much more then we love our selves, and he
infinitely knows, what will best fit us: He lets us know as much of his love
as we are able to bear, and fit to be Masters off in this present state; He
that has of has mere Grace appointed us to glory, should we not trust him, as
knowing best how to carry us through this world unto it; And he lets us want
nothing of this world that would not hurt us, when he denies us herein, but to
keeps us out of deadly snares, and fence us from being peirced through with
many sorrows; whatever our condition be in this world, let this consideration
sanctify the best, and sweeten the worst, to us, it is our Fathers portion.

Sixthly, If we are sons, lets love our brethren, lets not be unnatural to
the Saints, enquire for them as David did after the house of Saul, that he
might show kindness to them, and use them as he did Mephibosheth, though he
were lame of his feet, take them into your bosom, though they are deformed
before the world, perhaps they want their right hands, and their right eyes,
nay though they have many infirmities, and are some of them poor, peevish,
froward children, yet love them for their fathers sake, our Lord expects this
at our hands, that we should love the Brethren; and has left a solemn charge
with us in his absence to do it, we have these always with us, to show our love
to, but we have not him always: Where should love be perfected, if not amongst
those who have him that is love it self for their Father, we shall have
nothing but hatred from the world, should not that make us love the more? Lets
not therefore be unkind to the poor Saints, say of them wheresoever, and in
what soever condition you find them, as Adam said of Eve, when she was brought
to him, this is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; we came all out of
that pierced side of our Lord: and be not unkind to your own flesh, but love
it, and cherish it: hereby shall we appear to be sons in loving the Saints as
brethren.

Seventhly, and Lastly, If God be our father, be not afraid, nor troubled to
go to him, remember how our Lord comforted himself, and his Disciples, at his
departure, I go says he, to my father, and your father: O be not troubled to
dye, you shall be with your father, that loves you, be not discouraged to
come before him, because of your unkind, untoward dealings with him, he is
your father that has freely passed by all; you shall read in Genesis 50.16, 17.
when Joseph's brethren after their Fathers death, spoke to him of their former
unkindnesse to him, and discovered their fears that he would punish it upon
them: Joseph wept, the Text says when they spoke unto him, they much mistook
his heart, they took a wrong measure of his spirit by the narrowness of their
own: it is so with us in this case: we shall when we dye be at home; we are
here in a strange Country, ill used, not known; there we shall be in honor,
we shall see our father, whom we have so much longed to know, and who has
kept us all our life long, and we shall be used like sons, and sit down at his
right hand with the son our head: Let this consideration that the great God is
our Father, make us willing to shut our eyes to the world, and be no more seen
here, that we may be with him, lets say with Paul, to be dissolved and to
be with Christ, and with him, is best of all: Let not the fear of death, keep
us as it did them of old, all our life time in bondage, but lets now
rejoycingly wait all the days of our appointed time till our change shall come.

And thus having had some glimmerings of this glorious state of the Saints, and
of the obligations, or rather great privileges that do attend it, let us try
and prove our selves whether we be in this state or not, whether we are
Bastards, only in profession and appearance sons, or whether we be sons
indeed, and have that true spirit of the son dwelling in us, and that we may
do it; I shall lay down some concomitants amongst many, of that true state of
Sonship; wherein as in a glass, we may see out faces, and judge of our selves
as to this matter.

1 If we are sons, we have a spirit of prayer to go to God in all
extremities, it is not so with an hypocrite, he cannot pray always, God sends
the spirit of his son into our hearts, and he sends it crying Abba father, it is
a spirit of prayer while we are in this world, it is but crying and groaning in
us.

A son has not only the form of coming unto God, and the gift of praying, but
the Grace of praying for him, the spirit it self makes intercession, with sighs
and groans which cannot be expressed: if this spirit be hid, it is hid to them
that are lost.

2 A son does all out of love, he loves God as his father, all his service it is
out of love, it is not forced and wrung from him, he does not as Saul did, force
himself to sacrifice: but he offers up himself freely. He fears, he repents,
he mourns, he mortifyes himself, and all out of love; he rejoices to dye
daily, he has love that is strong as death, many waters can not quench it, he
loves God, and therefore thinks nothing too much to do, is not measuring the
minutes of that time he spends in his service, but is through love, all his
days, and in every thing, giving himself up wholly to the Lord.

3 A son can bear affliction, takes not things unkindly from God, submits to
the father of spirits. A son trusts God though he kill him, he knows though
he do sorely afflict him, yet he will at last return as he did to Ephraim,
in Jer. 31. says God. is Ephraim my dear Son, is he a pleasant child? since
I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still; A son will hang upon
God, though he seem never so angry with him: Let me go says God to Jacob, I
will not let thee go, says he, till thou bless me. This seems strange, but
it is the son like spirit.

A worldly man and an hypocrite, grows presently out of love with God, a little
thing will make him fly in Gods face, and cry out, what profit is it that I
have fasted? A man without the spirit of a son, when he is under an afflicting
hand, he tumbles like a wild bull in a net, he is presently with Jobs wife,
cursing of God, a carnal professor grows worse and worse by the rod; A Son
learns obedience as Christ did by the thing that he suffers, he is more meek,
more broken hearted, lies lower at Gods feet, and he says not a word more,
but with old Eli, it is the Lord, let him do what seems him good: It Is my fathers
hand is upon me, though it seem heavy, he corrects me for my profit, that I
might partake of his holiness, and he so corrects every son that he receives,
and I shall reap the quiet and peaceable fruit of righteousness by all in the
end.

4 He that has the spirit of a son, uses all enjoyments both natural and
spiritual in freedom, is sensible of his propriety in his Fathers right, it is
not so with another: A Son is never hide-bound nor in bondage with what he
possesses, he lives in the spirit of the son, and that is a free spirit.

A Spirit of Adoption makes a man extreme strickt, and true to God as a Father,
and so extreme free in whatsoever he does: He has a large spirit, and is not
at touch not, taste not, handle not, it is much otherways with a man that has a
legal conscience, as Solomon says in another case so it is with him, he never
eats his bread with comfort: Every thing proves a snare and a burden to him:
If therefore any be awakened to look heaven ward, and desires to live the life
of a Christian, let him wait for the spirit of a son, and so he shall come to
know that Kingdom of God, that is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

FINIS.
