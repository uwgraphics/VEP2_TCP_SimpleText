A DIALOGUE BETWEEN DOCTOR TITUS, AND BEDLOWS GHOST.
Concerning the Bayling the LORDS out of the TOWER.
Gh^st. TITUS.


Titus. God's Death! Who calls?


Ghost. Titus!


Tit. Booger Le Diable!


Gho. Titus!


Tit. Be Damned.


Gho. You must be Hanged First.


Tit. Be Burnt at the Dog First. I would Cut my Throat with E -- x, or ^^ve in
a Garret with Sr. Patience, rather then out of pure Guilt of Confence for my,
Villainous Lying; Sneak out of the World as you did, with a (...) to you.


Gho. With a Rope to you; for a Lie will never Choke thee, otherwise thou ^^'st
got the Start of me; and the Devil thy Father had given thee the Prehe^^^ence
before me.


Tit. Well, I have a Thousand Substantial Commonwealth, Cits, will ^^^nd by me
still.


Gho. And does thou hope they will be all Parliament Men?


Tit. Yes, By your Favor, (Brother Insolence) for a Parliament, and for a
^^^er too.


(...) Yes, I Will warrant you, and for a New Popish Plot, and a Popish Exclu^^^^
Bill, like Prince Rupert's Monkey; they Cut themselves off by Foolishly ^^^ping
into the Piece they have too wantonly Fired, and blow themselves up (...) own
Train. But pray you does your Monkyship think there are no ^^^al People in the
City?


Tit. Loyal! What do tell me of Loyalty? I keep no such Company, nei^^^^ do I
desire their Acquaintance. What did ever I get from a Loyal Man, (...) a base
Affront, or a broken Pate, or a scalding Dish in my Face.

But if ever I live to see a Parliament. --


Gho. Thou have nothing in thy Head but a Parliament, it has no being any (...)
else, and yet thou have it at thy Tongues end, like a Scotch Green Goose, (...)
a Parrot, that can say nothing but Tut Titus, and Walk Knave Walk. To (...)
thee out of this Language, prithee tell me, what do thou think of the ^uling
of the Lords, and what does the World think of thee and thy shamed ^s?


Tit. I Will say no more, but if ever a Parliament Sit in England. --


Ghost. They wo^^d still bear it with Patience, as you see they have done
several Years together, wh^lst some of thy Fa^t^on are so Impatent of
Restrai^^* that they had rather Cut their Throats, then suffer a Months
Imprisonment.


Titus. Hum! Verily, and in Verba Sacerdotis, I see Popery and Idolat^y bre
^^^ng in upon us, like a ^^ghty Current, it comes like a Land Flood a^^^^ a
great (...) that drives all before it, and will break us to pieces like Earthen
^s one ag^^n^^ another. The Pilgrims are coming in, in whole Armies; Ver^^y
Brother, had the Frost held but one Week longer, they had been all here (...)
^^t already.


(...) Yes, with ^ern^^nt^^^^s black Bills, and blank Commissions. But (...)
do^t think will become of thee, when this Invincible Army shall Land upon (...)
Downs? They Would har^ly pamper the^ up with Six Dishes a Day, and as ma^y Bottles
of fresh Burgundy.


Titus. Six Lashes and as many Halters. But while I can escape 'em, were it not
better (...) at Home amongst my Friends, then starve abroad amongst (...)
Enemies?


Ghost. Abroad? Where can'd thou hide thy self abroad, from the loud Cry of
Innocent Bl^ud? Gen^va will not receive theee.

The Church which thou have Renounced will be no Sanctuary; thou w^lt ^e dragged
out of the Pulpit where thou have Blasphem^d, and torn from the A^^^^ wh^^h
thou have profain'd.

I know no Refuge thou have left thee now but to Don John, or the M^ A^; one
cannot choose but entertain thee, for thy Intrecate Acquaintence with him
formerly, and the others for Parson Elliot's Sake.


Titus. I will go to neither, I will follow my Friend Patience, and Coop myself
up in a Cock-Loft in Southwark.

There I will set up an Evidence School, to Instruct all People Old and Yo^^^
for Twelve Pence a Week in all manner of Villainy, the most Compendious (...) to
Bugger, Plunder, Forge, Cheat, Swear, and Lie too, and again, backward and
forward upon all sides, and all Occasions with they self, Prance or any o^^e^
Evidence Master in Europe.


Ghost. Now I am gone, how long will that Trade hold before thou ^^t hanged.


Titus. Then* Actum est Caron perijsti Titus, and there is an End.


Ghost. No, thou shall not have so Favorable a passage, tho the Devil himself
wait to wast the over.

Thou art destined for a worse Sentance, which I am sent as thy Judge to
pronounce before thee ere thou have the Honor to be hanged. Tubman shall Ri^e
thee to Death, Bowman shall burn thee, and Reading shall Sing the into the
^^quiem of the Wretched. The Women shall Stone thee for thy abuse of the S^^
The Rabble who proclaimed thee a Savior of the Nation shall tear thee in
p^eces for an Imposture. Thy Quarters shall Adorn the City Gates, and thy b^
Fa^e exalted on the same Pinnacle, shall make Nolls Copper Nose blush to see
himself outdone by thy Matchless Impudence.

When this is done, I shall be one of thy Insernal Guard, to receive thee in
our Dominions, and prepare thee a Place with thy Brother Turn-Cassoc^ H^ Peter's.
