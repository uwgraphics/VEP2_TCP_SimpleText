THE Plotting Cards Revived, Or, the New game at Forty One.
To the Tune of, I tell the Dick, etc. 31 May 1681
The First Part.
1.
COme, cut again; the Game's not done,
Though strangely yet the Cards have run,
As if they pack't had been:
Most, likely are to loose, and say
They know not what is next best to Play:
Such shuffling never was seen.
2.
Look well (my Masters) to your hits,
And have about you all your wits,
For high the Play does run;
Three Kingdoms now at stake do lie,
And Rooks all hocus-tricks do try,
That ye may be undone.
3.
On Clubs and Spades, some wholly bet,
For they the most are like to get,
Whilst Hearts in vain contest;
And Diamonds too, unto their cost
Who have them, sure are to be lost,
The Blackest Cards are best.
4.
God Bless all King's and Queens, though now
The best Coat Cards, (the Lord knows how)
At this preposterous Game,
Are all like to Commanded be,
And trump't with all their Royalty,
By every Knavish Pam.
5.
So H^^rson blind (though he be dead,)
Alive was by blind Fortune led,
And still did winning go,
And ever since we find that he,
Sweep's all with his Effigy,
The great Pamphilio.
6.
Nay Trays and Duces, which were deemed
The basest Cards, are now esteemed
Prime ones to win the Day,
So that you see, to gain the prize,
Poor King's and Queens you must despise,
And Honors throw away.
7.
Thus the best Cards are now the worst,
And what was last is become first,
No wonder now adays:
The Nation topsy turvy lies,
And as 'twere pleased with CONTRARIES,
At losing Load'um Plays.
The Second Part.
8.
THis is like some Vtopian game,
Where Servant Maids control their Dame,
And King's are Subjects made;
Felons their Judges do indite,
And he a Traitor is down right,
Who falsely is betrayed.
9.
A Dunce who never took Degrees,
But such as led to Villainies,
A DOCTOR is most sound.
He who to furnish his own wants,
Can seize Gold-Cross, or Silver-Saints
A JUSTICE is renowned.
10.
Who Horse to Battle never led,
But has with many Horses fled,
Out of his Neighbors field,
A CAPTAIN is, and with his word,
Kills more than with his dulle: Sword,
He ever made to yield.
11.
A VILLAIN, who can cheat his Lord
Cets Chains of Gold, instead of Cord,
And is from Prison freed:
For HIM who says he Murdered has,
A Pardon both for that does pass,
And all he ever did.
12.
WHO for fowl Crimes and Forgeries,
Has worn the Yoke of Pillories,
And has been whipped about,
I^ he but add new Perjury,
He wipes of past Iniquity,
And speaks Truth without doubt.
13.
He that had rather choose to dye,
Then to Redeem his Life and Lie;
Is the only perjured Rogue:
And they who Damn themselves to live,
Sure signs of their Probation give,
For they are the Saints in vogue.
14.
Then Play away, (good Country Man,)
What Hand's the best, is now most plain,
And boldly thou may Stake;
A PACK of KNAVES together get,
And never doubt to win the Set,
For They the Voll will make.
FINIS.
