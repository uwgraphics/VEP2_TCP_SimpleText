A New Song of an Orange, To that excellent Old Tune of a Pudding, etc.
GOOD People come buy
The Fruit that I Cry,
That now is in Season, though Winter is nigh,
'Twill do you all good,
And sweeten your Blood,
I Am sure it will please you when once understood
It Is an Orange.
Its Cordial Juice
Does much Vigor produce,
I may well recommend it to every man's use;
Though some it quite chills,
And with fear almost kills,
Yet certain each honest Man benefft feels
by an Orange.
To make Claret go down
Sometimes there is found
A Jolly good Health to pass pleasantly round:
But yet I Will protest,
Without any Jest,
No flavor is better than that of the taste
of an Orange.
Perhaps you may think
At White H -- they stink,
Because that our Neighbors come over the Sea,
Yet sure it is presumed
That they may be perfumed
By the scent of a Clove when once it is stuck
in an Orange.
If they would cure the ayls
Of the Pr -- of Wa --
When the Milk of Milch Tyler does not well agree,
Though he is subject to cast
They may better the taste,
Yet let 'em take heed lest it Curdle at last
with an Orange.
Old Stories rehearse
In Prose and in Verse,
How a Welsh Child was found by loving of Cheese,
So this will be known
If it be the Q -- s own;
For the taste it utterly then will disown
of an Orange.
Though the Mobile bawl,
Like the Devil and all,
For Religion, Property, Justice and Laws;
Yet in very good sooth
I Will tell you the truth,
There nothing is better to stop a man's mouth
than an Orange.
We are certainly told
That by Adam of old
Himself and his Bearns for an Apple was sold
And who knows but his Son
By Serpents undone,
And his Juggling Eve may chance lose her own
for an Orange.
London, Printed in the Year, 1688.
