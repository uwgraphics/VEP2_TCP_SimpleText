YOu shall swear to be good and true to our Sovereign Lord the Kings Majesty,
His Heirs and Successors: And well and truly you shall serve your Master for
the term of your Apprentice hood, and in lawful and honest causes you shall be
obedient unto him, and unto the Master, Wardens, and Assistants of this

truly behave you and surely keep your Oath to your power.

So help you God.

And if it fortune you to depart from your Master his service, you shall not
serve any person out of the said Fellowship without License of the Master and
Wardens for the time being, upon pain to forfeit and pay to the use of the

Assistants for the time being.

God save the King.
