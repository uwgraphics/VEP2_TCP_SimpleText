A New SONG. ON King William and Queen Mary.
To the Tune of, Joy to great Caesar. Licensed according to Order.
^

First Strain.
LET Crowns, Fame and Treasure,
Love and Joy without Measure,
Still attend our great Caesar,
Let Jove take a Pleasure,
To quaff Divine Nectar,
And Drink his Duration
Like a boon jolly Hector,
To the God of our Nation.
Second Strain.
Try chance,
Let Us advance,
Bid defiance
To all France.
Let Kettle Drums and Trumpets sound,
Let every Man stand his ground,
Till with Laurels Crowned,
And Courageously make
The Monsieur Quake,
His Fistula ache
Till he betake
To flight for the sake
Of his last stake.
Third Strain.
Let Patriots guard the Throne,
Let Papists all go down,
Let Perkins meet the Fate
For to be owned a Cheat,
Let Jefferies have his Dream
For swimming with the stream,
Let Father Peter's swing
With the Nuncio in a string,
Let Gods made of poor Bread
No more be worshipped,
But every Popish Peer
That goes Ambassador
To Rome forfeit his Head
For such a Traitorous Deed,
And all the Lands he owns
To satisfy the Crown,
The Expenses on that Whore.
Fourth Strain.
Great Orange undaunted fears not their damned Treason,
But with Godlike Patience would bring them to Reason,
Till tired with their Plottings, like Jove with his Thunder,
The Wretches he scatters and brings them all under.
Fifth Strain.
Then to the Queen lets render our praise,
The glory of Britain and Honors bright Theme,
The Envy and Hate
Of Jesuits Pates,
Whose cunning contrivances prove but a Dream.
Sixth Strain.
Let Gaudy Processions,
And Lustful Confessions
With James our late King in France ever stay,
Let wit got with trial
Now make us defyal,
Those shamming pretenses could once us betray.
FINIS.
LONDON, Printed for E. Hawkins. 1689.
