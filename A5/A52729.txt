Fourteen Hundred Thousand Pound, made into One 1400000 l. clear Money, made
and secured by 1515000 l. to be Raised on Malt, and 115000 l. being left for
Interest, Premium and Charge.
Hundred and Forty Thousand Bills, of Ten Pound apiece, to be given out for so
much, as Occasion requires, and to be paid as Chance shall Determine in Course,
out of 1515000 l. to be Raised on a Duty on Malt, the odd 115000 l. being left
to be only made use of to pay Interest, Premium and Charge.
1 st. THAT the Fourteen hundred thousand Pounds be Divided 1400000 l. made
into 140000 10 l. Bills, to be paid in Course and Cleared in a Year.
into One hundred and forty thousand Ten Pound Bills, (Numbered from One to One
hundred and forty thousand) with an Interest of One Farthing a Day on every
such Bill, from the 24th June, 1697. to be Paid sooner or later, as Chance
shall determine the Course, but to be Cleared in one Year from that time.

2dly, That the said Bills may be disposed of to such Uses as the Money To be
paid out as Money.
to be Raised by the Malt Duty is to be Paid out for.

And that the Persons that are to receive such Money may be all equally All
equally dealt with, and 4 per Cent. Premium given.
satisfied at the same time they are so paid it, and may have such a Share of 4
per Cent. more, as Fortune shall give them.

Let Fifty six thousand Pounds be Divided into Benefits, as herein after set
down, and belong to such Numbers as they shall in the usual manner be Drawn
for, on the 2^thof July, 1697, or sooner, if all the One hundred and forty
thousand Ten Pound (...) disposed of.

The Division thus:
l. To the first Number Drawn, besides the Benefit may come up with it 150 One
Ticket of 1000 2 of each 500 l. 1000 3 of each 400 1200 The Benefit.
4 of each 300 1200 6 of each 200 1200 51 of each 100 5100 103 of each 50 5150
130 of each 30 3900 400 of each 20, and 8000 2800 of each 10 28000 3500 Besides
their own 10 l. a piece, which will make every 20 l. a 30 l. and every 10 l. a
20 l. Prize. The last Ticket Drawn, besides the Benefit may come up with it 100
Money 56000

Which 56000 l. so put into Benefits, as also every other 10 l. Bill How the
Benefits and 10 l. Bills, (without prejudice to the Exchequer Bills) are to be
paid in course, and till paid, to Satisfaction secured.
with its Interest, to be Paid in Course out of such Money as shall be Paid and
Received in Specie for the said Duty on Malt, before the 24th of June, School.
as far as the same will Extend.

And for Paying and Discharging the Benefits and Ten Pound Tickets with their
Interest, that shall remain unpaid and unsatisfied, on the said 24th of June
School. if it may be Enacted, That all the Money arising from all and every the
Aids (the 3s. Aid, and that comprised in the Act for making good the
Deficiencies of Parliamentary Funds, and to be comprised in the Leather Act
only except) given, or to be given this Sessions; and which shall come in and
be paid after the 24th of June, School: over and above what shall be employed for
the paying off and discharging Exchequer Bills, shall be used and employed, for
and toward paying the aforesaid Benefits and Bills. And

That the said Benefits and Ten Pound Bills (whilst any continue unpaid) shall,
from and after the said 24th of June, School. be taken and received in all such
Aids so given this Sessions, except as before is excepted, for as long as the
same shall continue; and when so taken in any of the said Aids, to be
immediately Cancelled as the Exchequer Bills are Enacted to be.

This will not Enterfeer with the Exchequer Bills, it obstructs no
Appropriation of any Revenue yet made, and will ensure the payment of such
Benefits and Ten Pound Bills ('it is believed) to a full Satisfaction.

And that all Persons concerned, may be fully assured of their being equally
dealt with; and that they shall be paid in such Course as their How the course
of Payment will be. with Justice ascertained.
Fortune allots, before the general Drawing begins, 140 Tickets Numbered from 1
to 140, signifying the First, Second and Third (and so to 140) thousand, shall
be put and well mixed in a Glass, and thence Drawn, and such Number as comes
first (and so successively) out, shall entitle the Owner of the Benefit or Ten
Pound Bill, comprised in such 1000, to be first paid off and cleared.

And if the Security and Course of Payment be settled as above is expressed, it
is not to be doubted, but that 'twill presently answer the full 1400000 l. (as
before is Proposed) to content.

Now if the Public Good does require the bringing in of Plate and How 4 or
500000l. (if need be) may, in Specie be had, and how Persons possessed of old
Money and Plate, may (besides other advantages) make 6 s. of it an Ounce.
old Money to be Coined, for increasing the Specie; and that 40 or 50000 of
such 10 l. Bills, may be disposed of for New Milled Money, or Hammered Silver
Money or Plate, with the Hall Mark upon it, or otherwise Sterling, at six
Shillings the Ounce, it will in all probability soon bring in such 4 or 500000
l. and please those that so part with their Silver.

This to be Proposed and Approved of at the Committee for the Malt Bill, or not
to be done at all.

April 3d. 1697. Tho. Neale.
