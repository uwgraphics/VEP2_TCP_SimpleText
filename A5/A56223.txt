OBSERVATIONS upon some of his Majesty's late Answers and Expresses.
IN this contestation between Regal and Paliamentary power, for methods sake
it is requisite to consider f^^se of Regal, then of Parliamentary Power, and
in both to consider the efficient, and final causes, and the means by which
they are supported. The King attributes the original of his royalty to God,
and the Law, making no mention of the grant, consent, or trust of man therein,
but the truth is, God is no more the author of Regal, then of Aristocraticall
power, nor of supreme, then of subordinate command; nay, that dominion which
is usurped, and not just, yet whilst it remains dominion, and till it be
legally again divested, referres to God, as to its Author and donor, as much
as that which is hereditary. And that Law which the King mentions, is not to
be understood to be any special ordinance sent from heaven by the ministry of
Angels or Prophets (as amongst the Jews it sometimes was) It can be nothing
else amongst Christians but the Pactions and agreements of such and such
politic corporations. Power is originally inherent in the people, and it is
nothing else but that might and vigor which such or such a society of men
contains in it self, and when by such or such a Law of common consent and
agreement it is derived into such and such hands, God confirms that Law: and
so man is the free and voluntary Author, the Law is the Instrument, and God is
the establisher of both. And we see, not that Prince which is the most potent
over his subjects, but that Prince which is most Potent in his subjects, is
indeed most truly potent, for a King of one small City, if he be entrusted
with a large Prerogative, may be said to be more Potent over his subjects,
then a King of many great Regions, whose prerogative is more limited: and yet
in true realitie of power, that King is most great and glorious, which has the
most and strongest subjects, and not he which tramples upon the most
contemptible vassells. This is therefore a great and fond error in some
Princes to strive more to be great over their people, then in their people, and
to eclipse themselves by impoverishing, rather then to magnify themselves by
infranchising their Subjects. This we see in France at this day, for were the
Peasants there more free, they would be more rich and magnanimous, and were
they so, their King were more puissant; but now by affecting an adulterate
power over his Subjects, the King there looses a true power in his Subjects,
embracing a cloud instead of Juno, but thus we see that power is but secondary
and derivative in Princes, the fountain and efficient cause is the people, and
from hence the inference is just, the King, though he be singulis Major, yet he
is universis minor, for if the people be the true efficient cause of power, it
is a rule in nature quicquid efficit tale, est magis tale. And hence it
appears that at the founding of authorities, when the consent of societies
convayes rule into such and such hands, it may ordain what conditions, and
prefix what bounds it pleases, and that no dissolution ought to be thereof, but
by the same power by which it had its constitution.

As for the final cause of Regal Authority, I do not find any thing in the
Kings papers denying, that the same people is the final, which is the
efficient cause of it, and indeed it were strange if the people in subjecting
it self to command, should aim at any thing but its own good in the first
and last place. It Is true according to Machavills politics, Princes ought to
aim at greatness, not in, but over their Subjects, and for the atchieving of
the same, they ought to propose to themselves, no greater good then the
spoiling and breaking the spirits of their Subjects, nor no greater mischief,
then common freedom, neither ought they to promote and cherish any servants
but such as are most fit for rapine and oppression, nor depresse and prosecute
any as enemies, but such as are gracious with the populacy for noble and
gallant Acts.

To be deliciae humani generis is grown fordid with Princes, to be public
torments and carnificines, and to plot against those Subjects whom by nature
they ought to protect, is held Caesar-like, and therefore bloody Borgias by
mere cruelty and t^eachery has gotten room in the Calender of witty, and of
spirited Heroes. And our English Court of late years has drunk too much of
this State poison, for either we have seen favorites raised to poll the
people, and razed again to pacify the people; or else (which is worse for
King and people too) we have seen engines of mischief preserved against the
people, and upheld against Law, merely that mischief might not want
encouragement. But our King here, does acknowledge it the great business of
his coronation oath to protect us: And I hope under this word protect, he
intends not only to shield us from all kind of evil, but to promote us also
to all kind of Political happiness according to his utmost devoyre, and I
hope he holds himself bound thereunto, not only by his oath, but also by his
very Office, and by the end of his sovereign dignity. And though all single
persons ought to look upon the late Bills passed by the King as matters of
Grace with all thankfulness and humility, yet the King himself looking upon
the whole State, ought to acknowledge that he cannot merit of it, and that
whatsoever he has granted, if it be for the prosperity of his people (but much
more for their ease) it has proceeded but from his mere duty. If Ship money,
if the Star Chamber, if the High Commission, if the Votes of Bishops and
Popish Lords in the upper House, be inconsistent with the welfare of the
Kingdom, not only honor but justice it self challenges that they be
abolisht; the King ought not to account that a profit or strength to him, which
is a loss and wasting to the people, nor ought he to think that perished to
him which is gained to the people: The word grace sounds better in the peoples
mouths then in his, his dignity was erected to preserve the Commonaltie, the
Commonaltie was not created for his service: and that which is the end is far
more honorable and valuable in nature and policy, then that which is the
means. This directs us then to the transcendent (...) of all Politiques, to
the Paramount Law that shall give Law to all humane Laws whatsoever, and that
is Salus Populi: The Law of Prerogative it self, it is subservient to this
Law, and were it not conducing thereunto, it were not necessary nor expedient.
Neither can the right of conquest be pleaded to acquit Princes of that which is
due to the people as the Authors, or ends of all power, for mere force cannot
alter the course of nature, or frustrate the tenor of Law, and if it could,
there were more reason, why the people might justify force to regaine due
liberty, then the Prince might to subvert the same. And it is a shameful
stupidity in any man to think that our Ancestors did not fight more nobly for
their free customs and Laws, of which the conqueror and his successors had in
part disinherited them by violence and perjury, then they which put them to
such conflicts, for it seems unnatural to me that any nation should be bound
to contribute its own inherent puissance, merely to abet Tyranny, and support
slavery: and to make that which is more excellent, a prey to that which is of
less worth. And questionless a native Prince, if mere Foree be right, may
disfranchise his Subjects as well as a stranger, if he can frame a sufficient
party, and yet we see this was the foolish sin of Rehoboam, who having
deserted and rejected out of an intolerable insolence, the strength of ten
tribes, ridiculously sought to reduce them again with the strength of two. I
come now from the cause, which conveyes Royalty, and that for which it is
conveyed, to the nature of the conveyance. The word Trust is frequent in the
Kings Papers, and therefore I conceive the King does admit that his interest in
the Crown is not absolute, or by a mere donation of the people, but in part
conditionate and fiduciary. And indeed all good Princes without any express
contract betwixt them and their Subjects, have acknowledged that there did lie
a great and high trust upon them; nay Heathen Princes that have been absolute,
have acknowledged themselves servants to the public, and borne for that
service, and professed that they would manage the public weal, as being well
satisfied populi Rem esse, non suam. And we cannot imagine in the fury of
war, (when laws have the least vigor) that any Generalissimo can be so
uncircumscribed in power, but that if he should turn his Canons upon his own
Soldiers, they were ipso facto absolved of all obedience, and of all oaths
and ties of allegiance whatsoever for that time, and bound by higher duty, to
seek their own preservation by resistance and defense: wherefore if there
be such tacit trusts and reservations in all public commands, though of the
most absolute nature, that can be supposed, we cannot but admit, that in all
well formed monarchies, where kingly Prerogative has any limits set, this must
needs be one necessary condition, that the subject shall live both safe and
free. The Charter of nature intitles all Subjects of all Countries whatsoever
to safety by its supreme Law. But freedom indeed has diverse degrees of
latitude, and all Countries therein do not participate alike, but positive
Laws must every where assign those degrees.

The great Charter of England is not strait in Privileges to us, neither is
the Kings oath of small strength to that Charter, for that though it be more
precise in the care of Canonical Privileges, and of Bishops and Clergymen (as
having been penned by Popish Bishops) then of the Commonalty, yet it confirms
all Laws and rightful customs, amongst which we most highly esteem
Parliamentary Privileges; and as for the word Eligerit, whether it be future,
or past, it skills not much; for if by this oaths Law. Justice and descretion
be executed amongst us in all judgments (as well in, as out of Parliament)
and if peace and godly agreement be (...) (...) amongst us all, and if the King
defend and uphold all our laws and customs, we need not fear but the King
is bound to consent to new Laws if they be necessary, as well as defend old:
for both being of the same necessity, the public trust must needs equally
extend to both; and we conceive it one Parliamentary right and custom, that
nothing necessary ought to be denied. And the word Eligerit, if it be in the
perfect tense, yet shows that the peoples election had been the ground of
ancient Laws and customs, and why the peoples election in Parliament should
not be now of as great moment as ever, I cannot discover.

That which results then from hence, is, if our Kings receive all royalty from
the people, and for the behoof of the people, and that by a special trust of
safety and liberty expressly by the people limited, and by their own grants
and oaths ratified, then our Kings cannot be said to have so unconditionate
and high a propriety in all our lives, liberties and possessions, or in any
thing else to the Crown appertayning, as we have in their dignity, or in our
selves, and indeed if they had, they were not borne for the people, but merely
for themselves, neither were it lawful or natural for them to expose their
lives and fortunes for their Country, as they have been hitherto bound to do,
according to that of our Savior, Bonus Pastor ponit vitam pro ovibus. But now
of Parliaments: Parliaments have the same efficient cause as monarchies, if not
higher, for in the truth, the whole Kingdom is not so properly the Author as
the essence it self of Parliaments, and by the former rule it is magic tale,
because we see ipsum quid quod efficit tale. And it is I think beyond all
controversy, that God and the Law operate as the same causes, both in Kings
and Parliaments, for God favors both, and the Law establishes both, and the
act of men still concurres in the sustentation of both. And not to stay longer
upon this, Parliaments have also the same final cause as Monarchies, if not
greater, for indeed public safety and liberty could not be so effectually
provided for by Monarchs till Parliaments were constituted, for the supplying
of all defects in that Government.

Two things especially are aimed at in Parliaments, not to be attained to by
other means. First that the interest of the people might be satisfied;
secondly that Kings might be the better counseled. In the summons of Edw. the
first (Claus. 7. 111. 3. Dors.) we see the first end of Parliaments expressed:
for he inserts in the writ that whatsoever affayre is of public concernment,
ought to receive public approbation, quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbari
debet, or tructari. And in the same writ he says, this is l^x ne tissima and
provida circumspectione stabilita, there is not a word here, but it is
observeable, public approbation, consent, or treaty is necessary in all
public expedients, and this is not a mere usage in England, but a Law, and
this Law is not subject to any doubt or dispute, there is nothing more known,
neither is this known Law extorted from Kings, by the violence and injustice
of the people, it is duly and formally established, and that upon a great deal
of reason, not without the providence and circumspection of all the states.
Were there no further Antiquity, but the reign of Edward the first to
recommend this to us, certainly so, there ought no reverence to be withheld
from it, for this Prince was wise, fortunate, just, and valiant beyond all his
Predecessors, if not successors also, and therefore it is the more glory to our
freedoms, that as weak and peevish Princes had most opposed them, so that he
first repaired the breaches which the conquest had made upon them. And yet it
is very probable that this Law was far ancienter then his reign, and the
words lex stabilita and notissima seems to intimate, that the conquest it
self, had never wholly buried this in the public ruin and confusion of the
State. It should seem at this time Llewcllins troubles in Wales were not quite
suppressed, and the French King was upon a design to invade some pieces of
ours in France, and therefore he sends out this summons ad tractandum
ordinandum, and faciendum cum Prelatis Proceris and aliis incolis Regni, for
the prevention of these dangers: These words tractandum, ordinandum, faciendum,
do fully prove that the people in those days were summoned ad consensum, as
well as ad concilium, and this Law, quod omnes tangit, etc. shows the reason
and ground upon which that consent and approbation is founded. It is true we
find in the reign of Edward the third, that the Commons did desire that they
might forbear counselling in things de queux ils nount pas cognizance; the
matters in debate were concerning some intestine commotions, the guarding of
the Marches of Scotland and the Seas; and therein they renounce not their right
of consent, they only excuse themselves in point of counsel, referring it
rather to the King and his Counsel. How this shall derogate from Parliaments
either in point of consent or counsel I do not know, for at last they did give
both, and the King would not be satisfied without them, and the passage
evinces no more but this, that that King was very wise and Warlike, and had a
very wise counsel of war, so that in those paticulars the Commons thought
them most fit to be consulted, as perhaps the more knowing men.

Now upon a due comparing of these passages with some of the Kings late Papers
let the world judge whether Parliaments have not been of late much lessened
and injured. The King in one of his late Answers, Alleadges that his Writs may
teach the Lords and Commons the extent of their Commission and trust, which is
to be Counselors, not commanders, and that not in all things, but in quibusdam
arduiis, and the case of Wentworth is cited, who was by Queen Elizabeth
committed (sitting the Parliament) for proposing that they might advise the
Queen in some things, which she thought beyond their cognizance, although
Wentworth was then of the House of Commons.

And in other places the King denies the assembly of the Lords and Commons when
he withdrawes himself, to be rightly named a Parliament, or to have any power
of any Court, and consequently to be any thing, but a mere convention of so
many private men.

Many things are here asserted utterly destructive to the honor, right, and
being of Parliaments. For first, because the Law had trusted the King with a
Prerogative to discontinue Parliaments: therefore if he did discontinue
Parliaments to the danger or prejudice of the Kingdom, this was no breach of
that trust, because in formalitie of Law the people might not assemble in
Parliament but by the Kings writ, therefore in right and equity they were
concluded also, so that if the King would not grant his Writ, when it was
expedient, he did not prove unfaithful, or do any wrong to the people; for
where no remedy is, there is no right. This doctrine was mischievous to us when
the King had a Prerogative to difuse Parliaments, and if it be not now exploded
and protested against, may yet be mischievous in the future dissolution of
Parliaments, for that power still remains in the Kings trust; and if to go
against the intent of trnst be no wrong, because perhaps it is remediless, our
Trienniall Parliaments may prove but of little service to us; Secondly when
Parliaments are assembled they have no Commission to Counsel but in such
points as the King pleases to propose, if they make any transition in other
matters, they are liable to imprisonment at the Kings pleasure, witness
Wentworths Case. A mere example (though of Queen Elizabeth) is no Law, for
some of her actions were retracted, and yet without question Queen Elizabeth
might do that which a Prince less beloved could never have done: There is a
way by goodness and clemency for Princes to make themselves almost
unlimitable, and this way Queen Elizabeth went, and without doubt had her
goodness and Grace been fained, she might have usurped an uncontroleable
arbitrary lawless Empire over us. The Sun sooner makes the travailour desert
his Cloak, then the wind; And the gracious acts of soft Princes (such as
Tiberius did at first personate) if they be perfectly dissembled may more
easily invade the subjects liberty then the furious proceedings of such as
Caligula was, but we must not be presidented in apparent violations of Law by
Queen Elizabeth; for as general reverence gave her power to do more then
ordinary, so her perfect undissembled goodness, upon which her reverence was
firmly planted, made the same more then ordinary fact in her, less dangerous
then it would have been in another Prince. In this point then leaving the
mere fact of Queen Elizabeth; we will retire back to the ancient Law and
reason of Edward the first, and we thereby shall maintain that in all cases
wheresoever the generality is touched, the generality must be consulted.

Thirdly, if the Lords and Commons be admitted to some Cognizance of all
things wherein they are concerned, yet they must merely Counsel, they must
not command, and the King Reasons thus, that it is impossible the same trust
should be irrevocably committed to Us, and our Heirs for ever, and yet a
power above that trust (for so the Parliament pretends) be committed to
others, and the Parliament being a body and dissolvable at pleasure, it is
strange if they should be guardians and controlers in the manage of that trust
which is granted to the King for ever. It is true, two supreames cannot be in
the same sense and respect, but nothing is more known or assented to then
this, that the King is singulis major, and yet universis minor, this we see in
all conditional Princes, such as the Prince of Orange, etc.

And though all Monarchies are not subject to the same condition, yet there
scarce is any Monarchy but is subject to some conditions, and I think to the
most absolute Empire in the world this condition is most natural and
necessary, That the safety of the people is to be valued above any right of
his, as much as the end is to be preferred before the means; it is not just
nor possible for any nation so to inslave it self, and to resign its own
interest to the will of one Lord, as that that Lord may destroy it without
injury, and yet to have no right to preserve it self: For since all natural
power is in those which obey, they which contract to obey to their own ruin,
or having so contracted, they which esteem such a contract before their own
preservation are felonious to themselves, and rebellious to nature.

The people then having entrusted their protection into the Kings hands
irrevocably, yet have not left that trust without all manner of limits, some
things they have reserved to themselves out of Parliament, and some thing in
Parliament, and this reservation is not at all inconsistent with the Princes
trust, though he desire to violate the same; but on the contrary, it is very
ayding and strengthening to that trust, so far as the Prince seeks to
perform it, for the peoples good; but it is objected, that a temporary power
ought not to be greater then that which is lasting and unalterable, if this
were so, the Romans had done unpolitikely, in creating Dictators, when any
great extremity assailed them, and yet we know it was very prosperous to
them, sometimes to change the form of government; neither always living under
circumscribed Consuls, nor yet under uncircumscribed Dictators: but it in
further objected, that if we allow the Lords and Commons to be more than
Counselors, we make them Commanders and Controllers, and this is not suitable
to Royalty. We say here, that to consent is more than to counsel, and yet not
always so much as to command and control; for in inferior Courts, the Judges
are so Counselors for the King, as that the King may not countermand their
judgments, and yet it were an harsh thing to say, that they are therefore
Guardians and Controllers of the King: and in Parliament, where the Lords and
Commons represent the whole Kingdom, (to whom so great a Majesty is due) and
sit in a far higher capacity than inferior Judges do, being vested with a
right both to counsel and consent, the case is far stronger; and as we ought
not to conceive, that they will either counsel or consent to any thing, but
what is publicly advantageous; so by such Council and consent, we cannot
imagine the King limited or lessened: for if it was by so known a Law, and so
wisely established in Edward the firsts days, the right of the people, to be
summoned at tractandum, ordinandum, faciendum, approbandum, in all things
appertaining to the people, and this as then was not prejudicial to the King,
why should the Kings Writ now abbreviate or annull the same, if the King
himself be disable for many high matters, till consent in Parliament add
vigor to him, it cannot be supposed that he comes thither merely to hear
Council, or that when he is more than councelled, that it is any derogation,
but rather a supply of virtue to him. A fourth thing alleged to the derogation
of Parliaments is, That whatsoever the right of Parliaments is to assemble or
treat in all cases of a public nature, yet without the Kings concurrence and
consent, they are livelesse conventions without all virtue and power, the very
name of Parliament is not due to them. This allegation at one blow confounds
all Parliaments, and subjects us to as unbounded a regiment of the Kings mere
will, as any Nation under Heaven ever suffered under. For by the same reason,
that Parliaments are thus vertulesse and void Courts, upon the Kings desertion
of them, other Courts must needs be the like, and then what remains, but that
all our laws, rights, and liberties, be either no where at all determinable,
or else only in the Kings breast? We contend not merely about the name
Parliament, for the same thing was before that name, and therefore the intent
is, that the great Assembly of the Lords and Commons do not represent and
appear in the right of the whole Kingdom, or else that there is no honor,
nor power, nor judicature, residing in that great and Majesticall Body, then
which, scarce any thing can be more unnatural. But these divisions between
the King and Parliament, and betwixt the Parliament and Kingdom, seeming more
uncouth, it is attempted to divide further between part and part in Parliament,
so making the major part not fully concluding, and in the major part, between a
faction misleading, and a party mislead. Such excellent Masters of devision has
Machiavils rule (divide and impera) made since the 3 of November 1640. It Is a
wonderful thing, that the Kings Papers being frayted scarce with any thing
else but such doctrines of division, tending all to the subversion of our
ancient fundamental constitutions which support all our ancient liberties, and
to the erection of arbitrary rule, should find such applause in the world: but
we say further, that there is manifest difference between deserting and being
deserted: if the wife leave her husbands bed, and become an adulteress, it is
good reason that she loose her dowry, and the reputation of a wife, but if the
husband will causelessly reject her, it is great injustice that she should suffer
any detriment thereby, or be dismissed of any privilege whatsoever. So if the
King have parted from His Parliament, merely because they sought His
oppression, and he had no other means to withstand their tyranny, let this
proclaim them a void Assembly: but if ill Counsel have withdrawn him, for
this wicked end merely, that they might defeat this Parliament, and derogate
from the fundamental rights of all Parliaments (as His Papers seem to
express) under color of charging some few factious persons in this
Parliament, (God forbid) that this should disable them from saving themselves
and the whole state, or from seeking justice against their enemies. So much of
the Subjects right in Parliament.

Now of that right which the Parliament may do the King by Council, if the
King could be more wisely or faithfully advised by any other Court, or if His
single judgment were to to be preferred before all advise whatsoever, 'twere
not only vain, but extremely inconvenient, that the whole Kingdom should be
troubled to make Elections, and that the parties elected should attend the
public business; but little need to be said, I think every man's heart tells
him, that in public Consultations, the many eyes of so many choice Gentlemen
out of all parts, see more then fewer, and the great interest the Parliament
has in common justice and tranquillity, and the few private ends they can have
to deprave them, must needs render their Counsel more faithful, impartial,
and religious, then any other. That dislike which the Court has ever conceived
against Parliaments, without all dispute is a most pregnant proof of the
integrity, and salubrity of that public advise, and is no disparagement
thereof; for we have ever found enmity and antipathy betwixt the Court and the
country, but never any till now betwixt the Representatives, and the Body, of
the Kingdom represented. And were we not now, those dregs of humane race
upon whom the unhappy ends of the world are fallen, Calumny and Envy herself
would never have attempted, to obtrude upon us such impossible charges of
Treason and Rebellion against our most sacred Council, from the mouths of
Popish, Prelaticall, and Military Courtiers.

The King says; It Is imp^obable and impossible that His Cabinet Counselors,
or his Bishops or seuldiers, who must have so great a share in the misery,
should take such pains in the procuring thereof, and spend so much time, and
run so many hazards to make themselves slaves, and to ruin the freedom of
this Nation: how strange is this? we have had almost 40 years experience,
that the Court way of preferment has been by doing public ill Offices, and
we can nominate what Dukes, what Earls, what Lords, what Knights, have been
made great and rich by base disservices to the State: and except Master Hollis
his rich Widow, I never heard that promotion came to any man by serving in
Parliament: but I have heard of trouble and imprisonment, but now see the
traverse of fortune; The Court is now turned honest, my Lord of Straffords
death has wrought a sudden conversion amongst them, and there is no other fear
now, but that a few Hypocrites in Parliament will beguile the major part there,
and so usurp over King, Kingdom, and Parliament for ever, sure this is next
to a prodigy, if it be not one: but let us consider the Lords and Commons as
mere Counselors without any power or right of Counselling or consenting, yet
we shall see if they be not less knowing and faithful than other men, they
ought not to be deserted, unless we will allow that the King may cause whither
he will admit of any counsel at all or no, in the disposing of our lives,
lands, and liberties. But the King says, that he is not bound to renounce his
own understanding, or to contradict his own conscience for any Counselors
sake whatsoever. It Is granted in things visible and certain, that judge which
is a sole judge and has competent power to see his own judgment executed,
ought not to determine against the light of nature, or evidence of fact.

The sin of Pilate was, that when he might have saved our Savior from an
unjust death, yet upon accusations contradictory in themselves, contrary to
strange Revelations from Heaven, he would suffer Innocence to fall, and pass
sentence of death, merely to satisfy a bloodthirsty multitude. But otherwise
it was in my Lord of Straffords case, for there the King was not sole Judge,
nay, he was uncapeable of sitting as judge at all, and the delinquent was
legally condemned, and such heinous matters had been proved against him, that
his greatest friends were ashamed to justify them, and all impartial men of
three whole Kingdoms conceived them mortal; and therefore the King might
therein, with a clear conscience have signed a warrant for his death, though he
had dissented from the judgment. So if one judge on the same bench, dissent
from three, or one juror at the bar from a eleven, they may submit to the
major number, though perhaps less skillful then themselves without imputation
of guilt: and if it be thus in matters of Law, a fortiori, it is so in matters
of State, where the very satisfying of a multitude sometimes in things not
otherwise expedient, may prove not only expedient, but necessary for the
settling of peace, and ceasing of strife. For example: It was the request of the
whole Kingdom in the Parliament to the King, to entrust the Militiae, and the
Magazine of Hull, etc. into such hands as were in the peoples good esteem.
Conscience and understanding could plead nothing against this, and if it could
have been averred (as it could not, for the contrary was true) that this would
have bred disturbance, and have been the occasion of greater danger, yet Where
the people by public authority will seek any inconvenience to themselves,
and the King is not so much intressed in it as themselves, it is more
inconvenience and injustice to deny then grant it: what blame is it then in
Princes when they will pretend reluctance of conscience and reason in things
behoofull for the people? and will use their fiduciarie power in denying just
things, as if they might lawfully do whatsoever they have power to do, when the
contrary is the truth, and they have no power to do but what is lawful and fit
to be done. So much for the ends of Parliamentary power. I come now to the true
nature of it, public consent: we see consent as well as counsel is requisite
and due in Parliament and that being the proper foundation of all power (for
omnis Potestas fundata est in voluntate) we cannot imagine that public
consent should be any where more vigorous or more orderly than it is in
Parliament. Man being depraved by the fall of Adam grew so untame and uncivil
a creature, that the Law of God written in his breast was not sufficient to
restrain him from mischief, or to make him sociable, and therefore without
some magistracy to provide new orders, and to judge of old, and to execute
according to justice, no society could be upheld, without society men could not
live, and without laws men could not be sociable, and without authority
somewhere invested, to judge according to Law, and execute according to
judgment, Law was a vain and void thing, it was soon therefore provided that
laws agreeable to the dictates of reason should be ratified by common consent,
and that the execution and interpretation of those Laws should be entrusted to
some magistrate, for the preventing of common injuries betwixt Subject and
Subject, but when it after appeared that man was yet subject to unnatural
destruction, by the Tyranny of entrusted magistrates, a mischief almost as
fatal as to be without all magistracy, how to provide a wholesome remedy
therefore, was not so easy to be prevented. 'Twas not difficult to invent
Laws, for the limitting of supreme governors, but to invent how those Laws
should be executed or by whom interpreted, was almost impossible, nam quis
custodiat ipsos custodes; To place a superior above a supreme, was held
unnatural, yet what a livelesse fond thing would Law be, without any judge to
determine it, or power to enforce it; and how could human consociation be
preserved, without some such Law? besides, if it be agreed upon, that limits
should be prefixed to Princes, and judges appointed to decree according to
those limits, yet an other great inconvenience will presently affront us; for
we cannot restrain Princes too far, but we shall disable them from some good,
as well as inhibit them from some evil, and to be disabled from doing good in
some things, may be as mischievous, as to be enabled for all evils at mere
discretion. Long it was ere the world could extricate it self out of all these
extremities, or find out an orderly means whereby to avoid the danger of
unbounded prerogative on this hand, and to excessive liberty on the other: and
scarce has long experience yet fully satisfied the minds of all men in it. In
the infancy of the world, when man was not so actificiall and obdurate in
cruelty and oppression as now, and when policy was more rude, most Nations did
choose rather to submit themselves to the mere discretion of their Lords, then
to rely upon any limits: and to be ruled by Arbitrary edicts, then written
Statutes. But since, Tyranny being grown more exquisite, and policy more
perfect, (especially in Countries where Learning and Religion flourish) few
Nations will endure that thraldom which uses to accompany unbounded and
unconditionate royalty, yet long it was ere the bounds and conditions of
supreme Lords were so wisely determined or quietly conserved as now they are,
for at first when Ephori, Tribuni, Curatores etc. were erected to poyze against
the scale of Sovereignty, much blood was shed about them, and, states were put
into new broils by them, and in some places the remedy proved worse then the
disease. In all great distresses the body of the people was ever constrained to
rise, and by the force of a Major party to put an end to all intestine strifes,
and make a redress of all public grievances, but many times calamities grew
to a strange height, before so combersome a body could be raised; and when it
was raised, the motions of it were so distracted and irregular, that after much
spoil and effution of blood, sometimes only one Tyranny was exchanged for
another: till some way was invented to regulate the motions of the peoples
moliminous body, I think arbitrary rule was most safe for the world, but now
since most Countries have found out an Art and peaceable Order for Public
Assemblies, whereby the people may assume its own power to do itself right
without disturbance to it self, or injury to Princes, he is very unjust that
will oppose this Art and order. That Princes may not be now beyond all limits
and Laws, nor yet left to be tried upon those limits and Laws by any private
parties, the whole community in its underived Majesty shall convene to do
justice, and that this convention may not be without intelligence,
certaine-times and places and forms shall be appointed for its regliment, and
that the vastness of its own bulk may not breed confusion, by virtue of
election and representation: a few shall act for many, the wise shall consent
for the simple, the virtue of all shall redound to some, and the prudence of
some shall redound to all. And sure, as this admirably composed Court which is
now called a Parliament, is more regularly and orderly formed, then when it was
called the mickle Synod, or Witenagenot, or when this real body of the people
did throng together at it, so it is not yet perhaps without some defects, which
by art and policy might receive further amendment, some divisions have been
sprung of late between both Houses, and some between the King and both
Houses, by reason of the uncertainety of jurisdiction; and some Lawyers doubt
how far the Parliament is able to create new forms and presidents; and has a
jurisdiction over it self. All these doubts would be solemnly solved. But in
the first place, the true Privileges of Parliaments, not only belonging to
the being and efficacy of it, but to the honor also and complement of it,
would be clearly declared: for the very nameing of Privileges of Parliament,
as if they were Chimera's to the ignoranter sort, and utterly unknown to the
learned, has been entertained with scorn since the beginning of this
Parliament. The virtue of representation has been denied to the Commons, and
a severance has been made betwixt the parties chosen and the parties choosing,
and so that great Privileges of all Privileges, that unmovable Basis of all
honor and power, whereby the House of Commons claims the entire rite of all
the Gentry and Commonalty of England, has been attempted to be shaken and
disturbed, most of our late distempers and obstructions in Parliament have
proceeded from this: that the people upon causeless defamation and unproved
accusations have been so prone to withdraw themselves from their
representations, and yet there can be nothing under Heaven, next to renouncing
God, which can be more perfidious and more pernicious in the people than this.

Having now premised these things, I come to the maine difficulties lying at
this time in dispute before us, it is left unquestioned that the legislative
power of this Kingdom is partly in the King, and partly in the Kingdom, and
that in ordinary cases, when it concerns not the saving of the people from
some great danger or inconvenience, neither the King can make a general
binding Law or Ordinance without the Parliament, or the Parliament without the
King, and this is by a known Maxim, Non recurrendum est ad extraordinaria etc.

It ought to be also as unquestioned, that where this ordinary course cannot be
taken for the preventing of public mischiefs, any extraordinary course that
is for that purpose the most effectual, may justly be taken and executed by
the most transcendent overruling Primum Mobile of all humane Laws, if the
King will not join with the people, the people may without disloyalty save
themselves, and if the people should be so unnatural as to oppose their own
preservation, the King might use all possible means for their safety, yet this
seems to be denied by the King, for he sets forth Proclamations and cites
Statutes in them to prove, that the power of levying arms and forces is solely
in him, and he presses them indefinitely, not leaving to the Subject any right
at all of rising in arms, though for their own necessary defense, except he
joins his consent and Authority: In the same manner also, he so assumes to
himself a share in the legislative power, as without his concurrence the Lords
and Commons have no right at all to make any temporary orders for putting the
Kingdom into a posture of defense, in what public distress soever: And
therefore in Sir John Hothaems case, he does not only charge him of Treason,
for observing the Parliaments instructions and Commissions in a pretended
danger, but he pronounces the mere act Treason, let the circumstances be what
they will. Let the world judge whether this be not contrary to the clearest
beams of human reason, and the strongest inclinations of nature, for every
private man may defend himself by force, if assaulted, though by the force of
a Magistrate or his own father, and though he be not without all confidence by
flight etc. yet here whole nations being exposed to enmity and hazard, being
utterly incapable of flight, must yield their throats and submit to
Assassinates, if their King will not allow, them defense.

See if this be not contrary to the original, end, and trust of all power and
Law, and whether it do not open a gap to as vast and arbitrary a prerogative
as the Grand Seignior has, and whither this be not the maine ground of all
those bitter invectives almost which are iterated and enforced with so much
eloquence in all the Kings late papers. See if we are not left as a pretty to
the same bloody hands as have done such diabolical exployts in Ireland, or to
any others which can persuade the King that the Parliament is not well affected
to him, if we may not take up arms for our own safety, or if it be possible
for us to take up arms, without some Votes or ordinances to regulate the
Militia, or to make our defense manly, and not beastiall and void of all
Counsel, the name of a King is great I confess, and worthy of great honor,
but is not the name of people greater? let not mere terms deceave us, let us
weigh names and things together, admit that God sheds here some rays of
Majesty upon his vicegerents on earth, yet except we think he does this out of
particular love to Princes themselves, and not to communties of men, we must
not hence invert the course of nature, and make nations subordinate in end to
Princes. My Lord of Strafford, says that the Law of Prerogative is like that
of the first table, but the Law of Common safety and utility like that of the
second, and hence concludes, that precedence is to be given to that which is
more sacred, (that is) Regal Prerogative. Upon this ground all Parasites build
when they seek to hood-winke Princes for their own advantages, and when they
assay to draw that esteem to themselves, which they withdraw from the people:
and this doctrine is common, because it is so acceptable: for as nothing is more
pleasant to Princes then to be so deified, so nothing is more gainefull to
Courtiers then so to please. But to look into terms a little more narrower,
and dispell umbrages; Princes are called Gods, Fathers, Husbands, Lords, Heads,
etc. and this implies them to be of more worth and more unsubordinate in end,
then their Subjects are, who by the same relation must stand as Creatures,
Children, Wives, Servants, Members, etc. I answer, these terms do illustrate
some excellency in Princes by way of similitude, but must not in all things be
applied, and they are most truly applied to Subjects, taken divisim, but not
conjunctim: Kings are Gods to particular men, secundum quid, and are sanctified
with some of Gods royalty; but it is not for themselves, it is for an
extrinsecall end, and that is the prosperity of Gods people, and that end is
more sacred than the means, as to themselves they are most unlike God; for God
cannot be obliged by any thing extrinsecall, no created thing whatsoever can
be of sufficient value or excellency to impose any duty or tie upon God, as
Subjects upon Princes: therefore granting Prerogative to be but mediate, and
the Weal Public to be final, we must rank the Laws of liberty in the
first Table, and Prerogative in the second, as Nature does require; and not
after a kind of blasphemy ascribe that unsubordination to Princes, which is
only due to God; so the King is a Father to his People, taken singly, but not
universally; for the father is more worthy than the son in nature, and the son
is wholly a debtor to the father, and can by no merit transcend his duty, nor
challenge any thing as due from his father; for the father does all his offices
meritoriously, freely, and unexactedly. Yet this holds not in the relation
betwixt King and Subject, for its more due in policy, and more strictly to be
challenged, that the King should make happy the People, than the People make
glorious the King. This same reason is also in relation of Husband, Lord, etc.
for the wife is inferior in nature, and was created for the assistance of man,
and servants are hired for their Lords mere attendance; but it is otherwise in
the State betwixt man and man, for that civil difference which is for civil
ends, and those ends are, that wrong and violence may be repressed by one for
the good of all not that servilitie and drudgerie may be imposed upon all, for
the pomp of one. So the head naturally does not more depend upon the body, than
that does upon the head, both head and members must live and dye together; but
it is otherwise with the Head Political, for that receives more subsistence
from the body than it gives, and being subservient to that, it has no being
when that is dissolved, and that may be preserved after its dissolution.

And hence it appears, that the very order of Princes binds them not to be
insolent, but lowly; and not to aim at their own good but secondarily,
contrary to the Florentines wretched Politiques. And it follows, that such
Princes, as contrary to the end of government, effect evil in stead of good,
insulting in common servilitie, rather than promoting common security, and
placing their chiefest pomp in the sufferance of their Subjects, commit such
sins as God will never countenance; nay, such as the unnatural father, the
tyrannous husband, the merciless master is not capable of committing; nay, we
must conceive that Treason in Subjects against their Prince, so far only as it
concerns the Prince, is not so horrid in nature, as oppression in the Prince
exercised violently upon Subjects. God commands Princes to study his Law day
and night, and not to amasse great treasures, or to increase their Cavaliers,
or to lift up their hearts above their brethren, nor to wast their own
demeanes, lest necessity should tempt them to rapine. But on the contrary,
Machiavels Instructions puff up Princes, That they may treat Subjects not as
brethren, but as beasts, as the basest beasts of drudgerie, teaching them by
subtlety, and by the strength of their Militia, to uphold their own will, and
to make mere sponges of the public coffers: And sure if that cursed Heretic
in policy could have invented any thing more repugnant to Gods commands, and
Natures intention, he had been held a deeper Statesman than he is; but I
conceive it is now sufficiently cleared, that all rule is but fiduciarie, and
that this and that Prince is more or less absolute, as he is more or less
trusted, and that all trusts differ not in nature or intent, but in degree only
and extent: and therefore since it is unnatural for any Nation to give away
its own propriety in it self absolutely, and to subject it self to a
condition of servilitie below men, because this is contrary to the supreme of
all Laws, we must not think that it can stand with the intent of any trust,
that necessary defense should be barred, and natural preservation denied to
any people; no man will deny, but that the People may use means of defense,
where Princes are more conditionate, and have a soveraigntie more limited, and
yet these being only less trusted than absolute Monarchs, and no trust being
without an intent of preservation, it is no more intended that the People shall
be remedilesly oppressed in a Monarchy, than in a Republique. But tracing this
no further, I will now rest upon this, that whatsoever the King has alleged
against raising of Arms, and publishing of Orders indefinitely, is of no force
to make Sir John Hotham, or those by whose authority he acted, Traitors,
unless it fall out that there was no ground nor necessity of such defense. So
much of danger certain.

I will now suppose the danger of the Commonwealth uncertain, the King says;
the Parliament denies; the King commands, the Parliament forbids: The King
says the Parliament is seduced by a traitorous faction; the Parliament says
the King is seduced by a Malignant Party: the King says the Parliament
tramples upon his Crown; the Parliament says the King intends War upon
them: to whether now is the Subject bound to adhere? I will not insist much
upon general presumptions, though they are of moment in this case: for without
all question it is more likely, that Princes may err and have sinister ends,
then such general conventions of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty so
instituted, and regulated as ours are in England. The King does highly admire
the ancient, equal, happy, well poyzed and never enough commended constitution
of this Government, which has made this Kingdom, so many years both famous
and happy, to a great degree of envy, and amongst the rest, our Courts of
Parliament: and therein more especially, that power which is legally placed in
both Houses, more than sufficient (as he says) to prevent and restrain the
power of Tyranny; But how can this be? if the King may at His pleasure take
away the being of Parliament merely by dissent, if they can do nothing but
what pleases Him, or some Clandestine Councillors, and if upon any attempt to
do any thing else, they shall be called Traitors, and without further
arraignment, or legal proceeding, be deserted by the Kingdom whose
representations they are, what is there remaining to Parliaments? are they not
more servile then other inferior Courts; nay, are they not in a worse
condition then the meanest Subject out of Parliament? and how shall they
restrain tyranny, when they have no subsistence at all themselves; nay, nor no
benefit of Justice, but arbitrary. Surely if these principles hold, they will
be made the very Engines and Scaffolds whereby to erect a government more
tyrannical then ever was known in any other Kingdom, we have long groaned
for them, but we are likely now to groan under them: but you will say, the
King has a power of dissent, he may use it at his pleasure, if he have none,
then he is a mere Cipher, and the Parliament may tyrannize at pleasure: either
the one or the other must be predominant, or else by a mutual opposition all
must perist; and why not the King predominant rather then the Parliament? We
had a maxim, and it was grounded upon Nature, and never till this Parliament
withstood, that a community can have no private ends to mislead it, and make it
injurious to it self, and no age will furnish us with one story of any
Parliament freely elected, and held, that ever did injure a whole Kingdom, or
exercise any tyranny, nor is there any possibility how it should. The King may
safely leave his highest rights to Parliaments, for none knows better, or
affects more the sweetness of this so well-ballanced a Monarchy then they do,
and it has been often in their power under great provocations to load that
rule with greater fetters and clogs, but they would not. Let us mark but the
nature, the right, the power, the wisdom, the justice, of Parliaments, and we
shall find no cause to suspect them, of such unmatchable treasons and
conspiracies as are this day, and never was before charged upon them; for our
Chronicles makes it apparent, that there is scarce any other Nation wherein
Monarchy has been more abused by rash inconsiderate Princes, then in this, nor
none at all wherein it has been more inviolably adored, and loyally preserved
from all diminution, I wish it were not some incitement to those execrable
Instruments, which steal the Kings heart from us, that they think the
Religion of Protestants too tame, and the Nation of the English too incensible
of injuries; but I hope God will the more tenderly resent these things. The
composition of Parliaments, I say, takes away all jealousies, for it is so
equally, and geometrically proportionable, and all the States do so orderly
contribute their due parts therein, that no one can be of any extreme
predominance, the multitude loves Monarchy better then Aristocracy, and the
Nobility and Gentry, prefer it as much beyond Democracy, and we see the
multitude has only a representative influence, so that they are not likely to
sway, and yet some influence they have, and that enough to preserve themselves
from being overswaid. We also in England have not a Nobility and Gentry so
independent and potent as in France, Germany, Denmark, etc. Nor as they were
here immediately after the Conquest, by reason of their great Feoffes, whereby
to give Laws either to the Crown, or the people; but they stand at such fair
and comely distances between the King and people, and also between themselves,
that they serve for an excellent Skreene and bank (as the Kings words are) to
assist both King and people against the encroachments of each other. And as the
middle Region of the air treats loving offices betwixt heaven and earth,
restraining the fumes and exhalations of Sea and Land, that they ascend not too
high, and at the same instant, allaying that restless Planets scorching
flames, which else might prove insufferable to the lower Elements: So does both
Houses of Parliament, as peaceably and sweetly arbitrate betwixt the Prince and
his poorest Vassals, and declining. Tyranny on the one side, and Ochlocracy on
the other, preserving entire to the King the honor of His Scopter, and to the
people the patrimony of freedom. Let us not then seek to corrupt this purity
of composition, or conceive that both Gentry; and Nobility can combine against
the King, when they have no power but derivative, the one more depending upon
the King, and the other upon the people, but both most excellently to affect
the good of the whole, and to prevent the exorbitance of any one part. Next,
the right of all the Lords and Commons in this State is so great, that no
change of goverement can be advantage to them in that temporary capacity,
except they could each one obtain an hereditary Crown, which is a thing
utterly impossible. Next, their power is merely derivative, so that except we
will conceive that both King and people will be consenting to the usurpation,
nothing can be done; and if we conceive that they may by fraud gain their
consent, nothing can withstand them. Lastly, their wisdom has been ever
held unquestionable, and their justice inviolable, no Prince that ever cast
himself thereupon was defrauded, no Prince that ever declined the same, proved
prosperous. In sum, Parliamentary government being used as Physic, not diet
by the intermission of due spaces of time, has in it all that is excelleut in
all forms of Government whatsoever. If the King be an affector of true
liberty, he has in Parliament a power as extensive as ever the Roman Dictators
was, for the preventing of all public distresses. If the King be apt to
intrude upon the common liberties, the people have hereby many Democraticall
advantages to preserve themselves. If War be, here is the Unitive virtue of
Monarchy to encounter it, here is the admirable Council of Aristocracy to
manage it. If Peace be, here is the industry and courage of democracy to
improve it. Let us now see how Kings usually, govern without Parliaments
especially such as are ruled by Council averse from Parliaments. I need not
speak of France, and other Countries, where together with these general
Assemblies, all liberty is fallen to the ground; I need not travel further then
our stories, nay, I need not pass beyond our own Times, my discourse will be
endless if I do.

The wisest of our Kings following their own private advise, or being
conducted by their own wills, have mistaken their best Subjects, for their
greatest enemies, and their greatest enemies for their best Subjects, and upon
such mistakes our iustest Kings, have often done things very dangerous. And
without upbraiding I may say, that this King by the fraud of such as have
incensed him against Parliaments, and his most loyal people, has so far been
possessed with a confidence in the zeal of Traitors, that he has scarce ever
yet enjoyed that grandour and splendour which his Ancestors did enjoy. He has
met in the field with two contrary Armies of his own Subjects, and yet that
Army which he went to destroy, and advanced their colors against him, was more
loyal than that which himself commanded, and yet both were more loyal than
those fatal whisperers which engaged them so one against the other, if the
whole Kingdom of Scotland had been more hearkened to, rather than some few
malignants of the Popish, and Prelaticall faction, the King had sooner found
out the fidelity of that whole Kingdom, and the infidelity of that wicked
faction. But as things then stood, the King was as much incensed against them,
as he is against us now, and he that did then persuade him that the Scots were
no Rebels, seemed as great an enemy as he does now that shall defend the
innocence of Sir John Hotham; there was no difference at all betwixt that ease
of the Scots, and this of ours, the King attributed then as much to his own
conscience and understanding, as he does now, and he attributed as little then
to the public Votes of that Kingdom, as he does now to this, only in this,
our condition is the more unhappy, because that so fresh and memorable
experiment does not at all profit us, but still by a strange kind of relapse,
the King seems now the more firmly to rely upon his own private reason, and
counsel, the more cause he has to confide in public advertisements, and the
more he professes to do contrary: the maine question now is, whether the
Court, or the Parliament gives the King the better Council; the King says, he
cannot without renouncing his own conscience and reason, prefer the Parliaments
Council before the Courts; and that which the King here calls Conscience and
reason, can be nothing else but mere private opinion; for if the Council of
the Parliament were directly opposite to common understanding, and good
conscience, and the Council of the Court were evidently consonant thereunto,
there needed no such contestation: For example, the Parliament conceives that
such and such ill offices have been done to frame parties; and unite forces
against the Parliament and the State, and therefore they desire that such
Towns, and Forts, and the public Militia may be entrusted to the custody and
command of such Noblemen and Gentlemen as they conside in; the Kings secret
Court-Councell suggests against this, that this request incloseth at reasonable
intention in it, and that the aim is to wrest all power out of the Kings hand,
that he may be forced to depose himself; the effect of this is no more but to
let the King know, that they are more wise and faithful than the Parliament,
and that he may do royally to hearken to them in condemning the Lords and
Commons of most inexpiable, unnatural, impossible Treason, for they must needs
love him better then the Parliament, but he cannot hearken to the Lords and
Commons without offering violence to his own reason and conscience; here we
see the misery of all, if Princes may not be led by their own opinions, though
infused by obscure whisperers, when they scandal the loyalty of whole
kingdoms without cause, rather then by the sacred and awful councels of whole
Nations, they are denied liberty of conscience, and ravished out of their own
understandings. And yet if Princes may be admitted to prefer such weak opinions
before Parliamentary motives and petitions, in those things which concern the
Lives, Estates, and Liberties of thousands, what vain things are Parliaments,
what unlimitable things are Princes, what miserable things are Subjects? I will
enlarge my self no longer upon this endless Theme: Let us look upon the
Venetians, and such other free Nations, why are they so extremely jealous over
their Princes, is it for fear lest they should attain to an absolute power?
It is merely for fear of this bondage, that their Princes will dote upon
their own wills, and despise public Councels and Laws, in respect of their
own private opinions; were not this the sting of Monarchy, of all forms it
were the most exquisite, and to all Nations it would be the most desirable:
Happy are those Monarchs which qualify this sting, and happy are those people
which are governed by such Monarchs.

I come now to the particularities of our own present case, for it may be said,
that though publik advise be commonly better than private, yet in this case it
may be otherwise; some men have advised the King, that the Parliament has
traiterous designs both against his Person and Crown, and not to be prevented
but by absenting himself, denying his influence and concurrence, frustrasting
and protesting against their proceedings is invalid and seditious, and laying
heavy charges of Rebellion upon them, to this advise the King hearkens, so the
Parliament requests, and advises the contrary, and now in the midst of all our
calamities, of gasping Ireland, and bleeding England, the Parliament seeing
that either they must make use of their legislative power and make ordinance to
secure some Forts and settle the Militia of the Kingdom in sure hands, and to
prevent the seducers of the King, or else two Kingdoms should probably be
lost, they do accordingly. The King proclaymes to the contrary
notwithstanding. The question then as I conceive is this only, whether or no
the King has any just cause to suspect the Parliament of Treason (and can make
appear to the world as some of his Papers mention) wherein they have attempted
or plotted any thing against his person and Crown, which was the only motive
why he sought to absent himself from London, and to possess himself of
Hull, and to frame such an impeachment against some of both Houses, if this can
be affirmed and proved, the Parliament shall be held guilty in all their Votes,
Ordinances and Commissions concerning Sir John Hotham and the Militia, etc.
Although it be the first time that any free Parliament was ever so criminous,
but if this cannot be prooved, it must be granted that according to the Votes
of Parliaments, the Kings departure did by frustrating Parliamentary
proceedings, in a time of such calamity and distress greatly endanger two
Kingdoms, and whosoever advised the King to that departure, and to the
charging of Treason, since laid upon the Parliament (and all such as have
obeyed them, in seeking to prevent public mischeefes) are as pernicious
enemies to this State, as ever received their being from it. The business of
Hull is most instanced in, let that be first survayd, Sir John Hotham is to be
looked upon but as the Actor, the Parliament as the Author in holding Hull, and
therefore it is much wondered at, that the King seems more violent against the
Actor then the Author, but since through the Actor the Author must needs be
pierced, if the Act be found Treason, let us consider of circumstances, the
same act may be treasonable or not, if such and such circumstances vary, for
example, to possess a Town and shut the gates against a King is Treason, if
there be not something in the act or in the intention, or in the Authority of
him that shuts the gates to qualify and correct the nature of Treason in that
act.

The first thing then to be looked on is, that the King was merely denied
entrance for that time, his general right was not denied, and no defying
language was given, no act of violence was used, though the King for diverse
hours together did stand within Musket shot, and did use terms of defiance,
and this makes the act merely defensive, or rather passive. And therefore how
this should administer to the King any ground to leavy guards at York, many
men wonder, or that it should seem the same thing to the King, as if he had
been pursued to the gates of York. Did the King without any fear treat Sir
John Hotham as a Traitor in the face of his Artillery, and after to enter Hull
with twenty Horse only unarmed, and continue such a harsh Parley, so many
hours, and yet when he was in York, in a County of so great assurance, could
nothing but so many bands of Horse and Foot secure him from the same Sir John
Hotham? The next thing considerable is the Parliaments intention: if the
Parliament have here upon turned any of the Townsmen out of their estates, or
claymed any interest in it to themselves, or have disseized the King, utterly
denying his right for the future, or have made any other use of their
possession, but merely to prevent civil war, and to disfurnish the Kings
seducers of Arms and Ammunition: let the State be branded with Treason, but
if none of these things be by any credit, though their enemies should be
judges, the most essential property of Treason must neeeds here be absent in
this act.

The next thing considerable is the Parliaments Authority, if the Parliament
be not vertually the whole kingdom it self, if it be not the supreme
judicature, as well in matters of State as matters of Law, if it be not the
great Council of the Kingdom, as well as of the King, to whom it belongs by
the consent of all nations to provide in all extraordinary cases, Ne quid
detrimenti capiat Respub: let the brand of Treason stick upon it, nay if the
Parliament would have used this forcible means unless petitioning would not
have prevayled, or if their grounds of jealousy were merely vain, or if the
jealousy of a whole kingdom can be counted vain, or if they claim any such
right of judging of danger, and preventing them without the Kings consent as
ordinary and perpetual, and without any relation to public danger, let the
reward of Treason be their guerdon.

But if their authority be so sacred, their intention so loyal, their act
free from offensive violence, and if the King might have prevented the same
repulse by sending a messenger before hand, or by coming without such
considerable Forces in so unexpected a manner, let not treason be here
misplaced. Had Faux fallen by a private man's Sword in the very instant, when he
would have given fire to his train, that act had not bin punishable; and the
Scots in England took Newcastle but by private authority, yet there were
other qualifications in that act sufficient to purge it of Treason, and he is
not comprehensive of the value of a whole State, nor of the vigor of our
national union which does not so interpret it; how much more unjust then is it
that the whole State of England shall be condemned of Treason for doing such an
act as this, when its own safety, wherein none can have so much interest as
it self, was so highly touched? Let not all resistance to Princes be under one
notion confounded, let the principles and ingredients of it be justly examined,
and sometimes it will be held as pious and loyal to Princes themselves, as at
other times it is distructive and impious. Let us by the same test try the
actions, intentions, and authority of the Papists now in Ireland: and compare
them with this business at Hull, and we shall see a diametricall contrariety
between them. Their actions are all blood, rapine, and torture, all ages, all
sexes, all conditions of men have tasted of their infernal cruelty. Their
intentions are to extirpate that Religion which has indeavored so long to
bring them from Idolatry and Atheism, and to massacre that nation which has
endeavored so gently to reduce them from poverty and beastiall barbarism.
Their chief leaders in this horrid tragedy, are Jesuits and mere Bandettoes,
and the Authority of King, Parliament, and Magistracy is the principal thing
which they strike at, and seek to overwhelme in this deplorable deluge of
blood, such a direct contrariety then being betwixt the true Rebels in
Ireland, and the misnamed Rebels here in England, the same men which condemn
the one, if they would be true to themselves, they ought to commend the other,
for we have had experience often in England, and other nations have had the
like, that Kings have marched forth amongst their enemies to encounter with
their friends, so easily are they to be flattered into error, and out of
error to seek the ruin of those which aim at nothing but perdition. And yet
questionless when Richard the second was environed with the Forces of Spencer,
and his confederates, vowing to sacrifice their blood in his quarrel, and in
defiance of the adverse traiterous Peers, he which would have told him, that
those Swords drawn for him, were in truth drawn against him and his best
friends, and those Swords on the other side drawn against him, or rather
against his seducers were indeed drawn for him, should have found but poor
acceptance, for without doubt the King would have thought such a suggestion an
abuse to his senses, to his reason, to his conscience, and an impudent
imposture, worthy of nothing but scorn and indignation. And if it had been
further pressed that the voice and council of the Peers was the voice and
council of the major and better part of the Kingdom, whereas Spencers party
was but of inconsiderable fortunes, and his Council was but private, and might
tend to private ends, it is likely the King at the last resort; would have
referred all to his own will and discretion; but I have now done with the
business of Hull, and therein I think with all objections against the
Loyalty of the Parliament, for the same reason will extend to all their Votes
and actions concerning the Militia, etc. and in sum all ends in this; if
Kings be so inclineable to follow private advise rather then public, and to
prefer that which closes with their natural impotent ambition, before that
which crosses the same, are without all limits, then they may destroy their
best subjects at pleasure, and all Charters and Laws of public safety and
freedom are void, and God has not left humane nature any means of sufficient
preservation. But on the contrary, if there be any benefit in Laws to limit
Princes when they are seduced by Privadoes, and will not hearken to the Great
Council of the Land, doubtless there must be some Court to judge of that
seducement, and some authority to enforce that judgment, and that Court and
Authority must be the Parliament, or some higher Tribunal, there can be no
more certain Crisis of seducement, then of preferring private advise before
public. But the King declines this point, and says, that he does not
undervalue the whole Parliament, or lay charge of Treason upon all, he does
confess that diverse have dissented, and diverse been absent, etc. he deserts
only, and accuses the faction and conspiracy of some few in Parliament. We
are now at last fallen upon an issue fit to put an end to all other invectives,
let us stick close to it. The King promises very shortly a full and
satisfactory narration of those few persons in Parliament: whose design is,
and always was to alter the whole frame of government both in Church and
State, and to subject both King and people to their own lawless Arbitrary
power and government; a little of this Logic is better then a great deal of
Rhetoric, as the case now stands. If the King will please now to publish the
particular crimes of such, as he has formerly impeached of Treason, and the
particular names of such as now he sets forth in those Characters, and will
therein refer himself to the strength of his proofs, and evidence of his
matter, it is impossible that any jealousy can cloud his integretie, or check
his power any longer; Then it will appear to all, that he has not left us,
out of any disaffection to Parliaments, or out of any good opinion of Papists,
Delinquents, and other Incendiaries, but that he was necessitated to depart
from us, that he might be the better able to preserve to us our Religion,
Laws and liberties, and that none of his solemn oaths of cordial love to us
has wanted integretie and faith. This will satisfy all lovers of Justice,
that he gives not light credit to weak whisperers or malicious informers
(whose aim may be to bring this Parliament to some ignoble trial, or to
confound it without any trial at all by general aspertions and mere
calumnious surmises) this will proclaim his cander and sincerity, and set a
brighter luster upon his Justice, then any oratory whatsoever. By the
performance of this promise he shall not do only right to himself, but also
to the whole kingdom, for the distracted multitude, being at last by this
means undeceived, shall not only prostrate themselves, and all their power
presently at his feet, but for ever after remain the more assured of his good,
whether to public liberties and Parliamentary Privileges. Howsoever nothing
but the awful promise of a King could make us think so dishonorably of
Parliaments, or suspend our judgments so long of them; for an Aristocracy in
Parliament cannot be erected without means, and what this means shall be, is
yet to us altogether inscrutible, for the power of Parliaments is but
derivative and depending upon public consent, and how public consent should
be gained for the erection of a new unlawful odious tyranny amongst us, is not
discernable, the whole kingdom is not to be mastered against consent, by the
Train Band, nor the Train Bands by the Lords or debutie Lievtenants, nor they
by the mayor part in Parliament, nor the mayor part in Parliament by I know not
what septem-virat, there is some mystery in this which seems yet above, if not
contrary to nature, but since the King has promised to open it, we will
suspend our opinion and expect it as the final issue of all our disputes.

The maine body of the difference being thus stated, I come now to the
observations of some other several objections against this Parliament, and
exceptions taken against arbitrary power in all Parliaments, and I shall
observe no order, but consider them as I find them, either dispersed or
recollected in the Kings late Expresses.

The Parliament being complained against for undutifull usage to the King above
all former Parliaments, has said, that if they should make the highest
presidents of other Parliaments their pattern, there would be no cause to
complain of want of modesty and duty.

The King, because some Parliaments formerly have deposed Kings, applies these
words to those Presidents, but it may justly be denied that free Parliaments
did ever truly consent to the dethroaning of any King of England, for that Act
whereby Richard the second was deposed, was rather the Act of Hen. the fourth,
and his victorious Army, then of the whole Kingdom.

The Parliament is taxed of reproaching this Kings government, to render him
odious to his subjects, whereas indeed all the miscariages and grievous
oppressions of former times are solely imputed to the ill Ministers and
Counselors of the King, And all the misfortunes of these times since November,
1640. are imputed to the blame of the Parliament: the Kings words to the
Parliament are, That the condition of his Subjects when it was at worst under
his government was by many degrees more pleasant and happy then this to which
the Parliaments furious pretenses of reformation has brought them to. In this
case the Parliament being accused of so heinous crimes, did uniustly betray
themselves, if they should not lay the blame upon the Kings evil Counselors,
the only enemies and interrupters of Parliaments. Nevertheless the King takes
this as a way of the Parliament to let them into their frank expressions of
him and his actions, and takes all things spoken against his ministers, as
spoken against himself, how miserable here is the condition of the Parliament,
either they must sink under unjust charges, or be censured for the reproachers
of their king, nay they are undutifull, if they tell not the King himself,
that he ought not to onerate himself with the blame of his Counselors.

The Parliament, because it could not obtain no equal Justice from the
Court-Caveleers, who are conceived to be the first moovers of those stirs and
tumults which happened at Westminster, did reserve the hearing of some of the
contrary side it self, upon this it is objected, that the Parliament incited
those seditious; and protected the actors in it, whereas they desire Justice
yet, and that both sides may be brought fairly to an equal hearing, and
before such hearing they desire that no parties may be condemned.

And whereas the Parliament, upon those rude commotions, are condemned as
unheard, and of that which is unproved, and never can be proved, That they
leavyed War upon the King, and drove him away, yet they desire that that mere
imputation may not draw any further opposition to their proceedings, and the
necessities of the State; for if the King could not stay at London with safety,
yet being now at York in safety, he may concur with the advice of his
Parliament; the distance of the place needs not cause any distance of
affection, since the King conceives He has so few enemies, and assures himself
of so many friends in Parliament.

The Parliament says, That none of its Members may be apprehended in case of
suspicion, where no information or witnesses appear, to make good the
Prosecution, without acquainting the Parliament, if leave may be conveniently
obtained. In opposition to this a case is put, Of a Parliament Man that rides
from York to London, and takes a purse by the way, the Parliament does not
privilege Robberies so done; for though no such thing be likely ever to be
done, yet if it be, in that case the evidence of the fact in that instant,
allows not only the apprehending, but the casual killing of such a Robber:
Who sees not many differences betwixt such a case, and that of the five Members
of the lower House, where neither Witnesses, not Informers, nor Relaters, nor
any particularity of crime could be produced? and yet by the same act the whole
House might have been surprised: And all the world knows, That the impeached
Members still suffer by that Charge, and yet can obtain no right against any
Informers, though it be now converted to their disadvantage.

The Parliament does not deny the King a true-reall Interest in any thing held
by him, either in jure Coronae, or in jurae Personae, yet merely because it
affirms, That in the same thing the State has an Interest Paramont in cases of
public extremity; by virtue of which it may justly seize, and use the same
for its own necessary preservation. Hereupon, the King replies, That this
utterly abolishes His Interest in all things, so that by this device, He is
made incapable, either of suffering wrong, or receiving right: a strange
violented wrested conclusion; and yet the Kings Interest in Hull, and in the
lives of his subjects, is not such an Interest as in other movables, neither
is the Kings Interest taken away from him; the same things are still reserved
for him, in better hands then he would have put them. The Parliament maintains
its own Council to be of honor and power above all other, and when it is
unjustly rejected, by a King seduced, and abused by private flatterers, to the
danger of the Commonwealth, it assumes a right to judge of that danger, and to
prevent it: the King says, That this gives them an arbitrary unlimitable power
to unsettle the security of all men's estates, and that they are seduceable, and
may abuse this power, nay they have abused it; and he cites the Anabaptists in
Germany, and the 30 Tyrants at Athens. That there is an Arbitrary power in
every State somewhere it is true, it is necessary, and no inconvenience follows
upon it; every man has an absolute power over himself; but because no man can
hate himself, this power is not dangerous, nor need to be restrained: So every
State has an Arbitrary power over it self, and there is no danger in it for the
same reason. If the State intrusts this to one man, or few, there may be danger
in it; but the Parliament is neither one nor few, it is indeed the State it
self; it is no good consequence, though the King makes so much use of it, That
the Parliament does abuse power, because it may: The King would think it hard
that we should conclude so against him, and yet the King challenges a greater
power then Parliaments: and indeed if the Parliament may not save the Kingdom
without the King, the King may destroy the Kingdom in despite of the
Parliament; and whether then challenges that which is most Arbitrary, and of
most danger? but the King says, This Parliament has abused their power. (I
wish Kings had never abused theirs more) And the Parliament answers, That this
is but his nude avirment, and in controversies that ought not to condemn
private men, much less ought Parliaments to fall under it. And as for Mr
Hooker, he does not say, That the Anabaptists in Germany did deceive
Parliaments with their hypocrisy, and therefore infer that Parliaments ought
no further to be trusted: the stirs of the Anabaptists in Germany conclude no
more against Parliaments, then the impostures of Mahomet in Arabia do. And as
for the 30 Tyrants of Athens, we know they were not so chosen by the people, as
our Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses are, nor created or called by any Kings
Writ, as our Peers are; nor did they so merely depend upon their own good
abearing, and the good liking both of King and State, as our Lords and Commons
now do; neither had they so many equals and Rivalls as both our Houses
contain: we know their power was not founded upon the consent of the Citizens,
but the strength of their Soldiers; neither were their Soldiers such as our
Train Bands, but mere mercinaries of desperate, or perhaps no Fortunes, whose
Revenue was rapine, whose Trade was murder: I fear they were more like our
Cavaliers at York, then the Militia at London: Were our new Militia any other
our old Trayn Bands, or our new Lievtenants, and Deputies, any other then the
same Lords and Gentlemen, with very little variation, which before were very
well reputed of, both by King and Commons, and not yet by either excepted
against, or did the whole fate of the kingdom depend merely upon the new
Militia, this new device of an Aristocrasie might seem the more plausible; but
as things now stand, this new Aristocraticall Fabric cannot seem to any
impartial man, but as empty a shadow, and ayrie a dream as ever man's fancy
abused it self withal.

The Parliament says, That the Kings power is fiduciary, and not to be used
against the Kingdom, but for it only: The King hereupon demands, May any thing
be taken from a man, because he is trusted with it? Or may the person himself
take away the thing he trusts when be will, and how he will? Our case of Hull
is not so general, The things there remaining in the Kings trust for the use
of the Kingdom were Arms, and by consequence of more danger, then other kind
of Chattels. And if I entrust my cloak to another custody, I may not take it
away again by force; But if it be my sword, and there is strong presumption,
that it may be drawn upon me, I may use any means to secure it.

The Parliament claims a right of declaring, and interpreting Law. The King
makes this question thereupon? Is the Law it self subject to your Votes, that
whatsoever you say, or do, shall be lawful, because you declare it so? Am I
supreme, and yet you above me? Must my power be governed by your discretion?
This is the Popes Arrogance, That all must submit their understanding, and
Scripture it self, to His declaring power: and a case is put of the Irish
Rebels, making themselves a major part in Parliament, and so voting against the
true Religion, etc. In perspicuous, uncontroverted things, the Law is it own
interpreter, and there no Judge is requisite, and the Parliament cannot be
taxed to have declared Law by the rule of their Actions; They have squared
their Actions according to Law, They may be censured, but they cannot be
convinced of any injustice. It Is true, In mere matters of State, the Parliament
is not bound to strict presidents at all times, but in matters of right, and
justic^ they have not deviated, either to the right hand, or to the left:
Howsoeve^, In matters of Law and State both, where ambiguity is, some
determin^^ion must be supreme, and therein, either the Kings power and t^ust
must be guided by the discre^ion of the Parliament; or else the Parliament, and
all other Courts must be overruled by the Kings mere discretion; and there can
be nothing said against the Arbitrary supremacy of Parliaments, etc. But far
more upon better grounds, may be said against the Arbitrary supremacy of the
King. As for the Popes Arrogance, who undertakes to interpret Scripture where
it wants no interpreter, And in matters of mere opinion to usurp over al^ men's
consciences; As if he had an infallibility in his sole breast. He is not an
instance so fitly to be alleged against Parliaments, as Princes, For slavish
very probable, That if the Church had not submitted it self to so (...) a
condition under one Man, but had been governed by some general Junto of
Divines fairly elected, it had never swerved into such soul idolatry, and
superstition, as it has done.

As for the case of Ireland, I conceive, it is improperly urged; For England and
Ireland are one and the same Dominion, There is as true and intimate an Union
betwixt them, as betwixt England and Wales; And though by reason of remote
situation, they do not meet in one, and the same Parliament; yet their
Parliaments, as to some purposes, are not to be held several Parliaments. And
therefore, if the papists in Ireland were stronger, and had more Votes in
Parliament then the Protestants, yet they would want authority to overrule any
thing voted, and established before in England. For the reason, why the minor
part in all suffrages subscribes to the major is, That blood may not be shed.
For in probability, The major part will prevail, and else strife, and bloodshed
would be endless: Wherefore the major part in Ireland, by the same reason
ought to sit down and acquiesce, because Ireland is not a several monarchy
from England; nor is that a major part of Ireland, and England too; for if it
were, it would give Law to us, as we now give Law there; and their Statutes
would be of as much virtue here, as ours are there.

The Parliament In case of extreme danger, challenges an Authority of settling
the Militia in sure hands, and removing doubtful persons; if the King will not
be entreated to do it of himself? The Kings says, This is to put His entrusted
power out of Himself into others, and so to divest and disable Himself for the
protection of His people. This is a strange mistake. The Parliament desires no
removeall of that power which was in the King, But that which was in such or
such a Substitute? And how do this divest and disable the King? And if the
King says, That He has a better opinion of such a Substitute, then of an
other, Though the Parliament conceive otherwise, Then what does He but prefer
His own private opinion before the most Honorable of all Counsels, before the
voice of the whole Kingdom? What higher Law then have we remaining then the
Kings will? And as for his account to God, will it be easy* for him to plead,
That he used such an instrument of His own mere discretion against public
advice if things prove unhappy, then that He followed the most noble Council,
and such whose life's, fortunes, and interests, were most deeply concerned in
it? And as for those absurd unreasonable, incredible suppositions of the
injustice, and treasons of Parliaments, as if they were less careful of the
public good, then single Rulers, Though it be spoken in derision, wise men
perhaps may be not so apt to laugh in applause, as in contempt of it. For how
has the Parliament removed the rub of all Law out of its way, because it
assumes to it self to be higher then any other Court, and to be in declaring
Law, as far beyond the Kings single countermands in Parliament, as other
inferior Courts are out of Parliaments? Or how, has it erected a new upstart
Authority to affront the King, and maintain an Aristocraticall usurpations,
when the main body of the Militia is still the same as it was, and such as the
King professes no suspicion of, and no alteration is of the heads thereof,
except only in some few popishly inclined, or not publicly so honored, and
confided in as they ought? And when the same Allegiance is performed, The same
Supremacy of power confessed to be now in the King over the Militia, as has
ever been? N^y, What ground can there be for this imaginary usurpation, when
the King professes, He fixes not that traitorous design upon both, or either
House of Parliament, being most confident of the Loyalty, Good Affections* and
Integrity of that great Body? Is the main body of the Kingdom loyal? Is the
main body of the Parliament loyal? Is the King true to Himself? And is all His
great party of Clergymen, Courtiers, Soldiers, etc. constant? And yet is
there a machination in hand, to introduce Aristocraticall usurpation odious to
all men; which neither Kingdom, Parliament, King, nor all the Royallists can
oppose? What a strange unlathomable machination, and work of darkness is this?
But this is said to be done by cunning, force, absence, or accident. If it be
by cunning, Then we must suppose that the Kings party in Parliament has lost
all their Law, policy, and subtilty, And that all the Parliament, except some
few are luld-a-sleep by Mercuries Minstrelsie; or that some diabolical charm
has closed up all their various eyes. If it be by force, Then we must suppose
that our Aristocraticall heads carry about them great store of that Serpents
teeth which yielded heretofore so sudden and plentiful a harvest of armed men,
being but cast into the furrows of the earth, Though their armies have been
hitherto invisible, yet we must suppose, That they are in a readiness to rise
upon the first Alarm beaten. If it be by absence, then we must suppose, That
this Aristocraticall machination is easily yet to be prevented, for it is not a
hard matter to draw a full appearance together, and that we see has been done
lately by the order of the House it self. Nay, we see it is not the House, but
the opposite part that desires to scatter, and divide, and draw away, and as
much as in them lies to hinder a full assembly: And therefore, This is not the
way. If it be by accident, Then we must be contented to expect, and have a
little patience; Fortune is not always constant to one certain posture, nor do
the Celestial bodies confine themselves to one unaltered motion.

The Parliament requests of the King, That all great Officers of State, by whom
public affairs shall be transacted, may be chosen by approbation, or
nomination of the great Council. The King takes this as a thing maliciously
plotted against him, as a proposition made in mockery of him, as a request
which He cannot yield to, without showing Himself unworthy of that trust, which
Law reposes in Him, and of His descent from so many great and famous Ancestors:
He conceives, He cannot perform the Oath of protecting His people if He abandon
this power, and assume others into it. He conceives it such a Flower of the
Crown, as is worth all the rest of the Garland, not to be parted with all upon
any extremity of conquest or imprisonment; nor for any low sordid
considerations of wealth, and gain whatsoever. He conceives, That if He should
pass this, He should retain nothing but the Ceremonious Ensigns of Royalty,
or the mere sight of a Crown and Scepter; (nay the Stock being dead* the Twigs
would not long flourish;) but as to true, and real power, He should remain,
but the outside, the picture, the sign of a King. Could this be, If all
Parliaments were not taken as deadly enemies to Royalty? the substance of the
request seems to be no more but this, That it would please the King to be
advised by Parliaments, rather then His own mere understanding, or any
inferior Counselors in those things which concern the liberties, and life's of
the whole people. And how could this request seem equal to a demanding of the
Crown, to a dethroning of the King, and to a leaving of the Kingdom destitute
of protection, if Parliaments were not supposed mortal enemies to Princes, and
Princes not supposed, but openly declared enemies to Parliaments; if the King
choose such a man Treasurer or Keeper out of his own good liking only, or upon
recommendation of such a Courtier, here he is divested of no power; but if it
be upon the recommendation of the whole Kingdom in Parliament, who in all
probability can judge better, and are more concerned, this is an emptying
himself of Majesty, and devesting himself of Power. Ordinary reason cannot
suggest otherwise hereupon, but either Parliaments affect not Kings, nor their
own good, nor would make good elections, or else Kings affect not Parliaments,
nor the Kingdoms good, and therefore they oppose such elections, merely because
they are good: but let us observe the Kings reasons against Parliamentary
elections; For first, He conceives them prejudicial for the people: Secondly,
Dishonorable to himself.

Man is by nature of restless ambition; as the meanest vassal thinks himself
worthy of some greatness, so the most absolute Monarch aspires to something
above his greatness. Power being over obtained by haughty minds, quickly
discovers that it was not first aimed at merely to effect Noble actions, but in
part to insult over others; and ambitious men thirst after that power which may
do harm, as well as good; nay, though they are not resolved to do harm, yet
they would be masters of it, -- Qui nolunt occidere quenquam -- Posse volunt.
And yet let this power be added, the mind still remains unfilled, still some
further Terrestrial omnipotence, a sharing with God, and surmounting above
mortal condition is affected. Our Law has a wholesome Maxim, That the King
may only do that which is just; but Courtiers invert the sense of it, and tell
him, That all is just which he may do, or which he is not restrained from doing
by Law. Such and such things Princes ought not to do, though no Law limited
them from doing thereof; but now those things which by nature they abhor to
do, yet they abhor as much to be limited from. That disposition which makes
us averse from cruelty and injury* we account a noble and virtuous disposition;
but that Law which shall restrain us from the same is stomacked at, and
resisted, as a harsh bit to put into our mouths, or bonds upon our arms.
Antoninus Pius is greatly renowned for communicating all weighty affairs, and
following public advice a* dapprobation in all great expedients of high
concernment; and he was not more honorable then prosperous therein. Had he
been a mere servant to the State, he could not have condescended further; and
yet if he had done necessarily, what he did voluntarily, the same thing had
been in the same manner effectual; for it is not the mere putting or not putting
of ^aw, that does after the nature of good or evil. Power then to do such an
evil, or not to do such a good, is in truth no real power, nor desired out of
any nobleness, but rather windy arrogance; and as it is useless to men truly
noble, so to men that love evil for evil ends it is very dangerous. What will
Nero more despise, then to condescend as Antoninus did? yet 'twere more
necessary that Nero were limited then Antoninus; for excessive power added to
Nero's cruelty, serves but as Oil poured upon flame. When Princes are as potent
as vicious, we know what Ministers swarm about them; and the end is, That as
vast power corrupts and inclines them to i^l Counsels so they perish at last
by Counselors worst of all. It Is pretended that Princes cannot be limited from
evil, but they may be disabled from doing good thereby, which is not always
true; and yet if it were, the people had better want some right, then have too
much wrong done them: for what is more plain then this, That the Venetians live
more happily under their conditionate Duke, then the Turks do under their most
absolute Emperors. Nevertheless, if we consider the noble Trophies of Rome
which it gained under Consuls, and conditiona^e Commanders, we may suppose that
no defect at all could be in that popular and mixed government. And our
neighbors in the Netherlands are a good instance; for they being to cope with
the most Puissant and free Prince of Christendom, being but the torn relic of
a small Nation, yet for their defense, would not put themselves under a
Dictatorian power, but they prepared themselves for that so terrible encounter,
under the Conduct of a General much limited. Neither have those straightened
Commissi^ns yielded any thing but victories to the States, and solid honor to
the Princes of Orange; and what more, the mightiest Monarchs of our age have
achieved or enjoyed, besides the filling of a fantastical humor with
imaginary grandour. I speak not this in favor of any alteration in England, I
am as zealously addicted to Monarchy, as any man can, without dotage: but I
know there are several degrees of Prerogatives Royal, some whereof have
greater power of protection, and less of oppression; and such I desire to be
most studious of: In some things I know it is dangerous to circumscribe Princes,
but in others there may be great danger in leaving them to their pleasure, and
scarce any hope at all of benefit; and amongst other things, the choice of
public Officers, if the State have (at least) some share therein with the
King, what considerable inconvenience can happen thereby to the State or King,
is not in me to foresee: but if it have no share, experience sufficient
teaches us what great disasters may happen. And so for the disusing and
dissolving of Parliaments; if the Parliament divide some part of that power
with the King, I see great good, but no harm at all that can ensue, either to
weaken the Crown, or disturb the subject thereby. But it will be said in the
next place, If this disables not the King from protecting the Subject, yet it
diminishes his own Right, and leaves him but the shadow of Royalty. This is
grounded upon a great mistake; for some men think it a glorious thing to be
able to kill, as well as to save, and to have a kind of a Creators power over
Subjects: but the truth is, such power procures much danger to ill Princes, and
little good to any; for it begets not so much love as fear in the subject,
though it be not abused; and the fear of the subject does not give so perfect a
Dominion as love. Were Hannibal, Scipio* etc. the less honored or beloved
because they were not independent? surely no, they were the less feared, and
for the same cause the more honored and beloved. Or were Alexander, Pyrrbus*
etc. the more honored or beloved, because they were independent? I believe the
contrary, and that they had lived more gloriously, and died less violently, if
a more moderate power had rendered them less insolent in their own thoughts,
and less feared in other men's. Was Caesar the private man less successful
in his Wars, or less dear in all his soldiers eyes, or less powerful in
his Countrey-mens affections, then Caesar the perpetual Dictator? No, if the
Imperial Throne of the World added any thing to Caesar, 'twas not excellence,
nor true glory, 'twas but the external complements of pomp and ostentation,
and that might perhaps blow up his mind with vanity, and fill the people with
(...), it could not make Caesar a nobler, gallanter, greater Caesar (...) he
was. I expect no less then to be laughed at at ^ourt, and to be h^ld the author
of a strange paradox, by those men which stick not to say, That our King is now
no more King of Scotland, then he is King of France, because his mere pleasure
there, is not so predominant in all cases of good and evil whatsoever: but I
regard not those fond things which cannot see in humane nature what is depraved
in it, and what not, and what proceeds from vain, and what from true glory; and
wherein the natural perfection of power and honor, differs from the painted
rays of spurious Majesty and Magnificence. To me the Policy of Scotland seems
more exquisite in point of prerogative, then any other in Europe, except ours:
And if the splendour, and puissance of a Prince consist in commanding religious,
wise, magnanimous, warlike subjects, I think the King of Scotland is more to be
admired then the King of France; and that he is so, to the mere ingenuity of
Government, I ascribe it. But some will allow, That to follow the pattern of
Antoninus freely, and voluntarily, as he did, is not dishonorable in a Prince;
but to be under any Obligation or Law to do so, is ignoble. And this is as much
as to say, That Law, though good, yet quate^^s Law is burthenous to man's
nature; and though it be so but to corrupted nature, in as much as it retains
from nothing, but that which nature in its purity would it self restrain from;
yet corrupted nature it self is to be soothed and observed. I have done with
this point: 'twas spoken in honor of Hen. 7. That he governed his subjects by
his Laws, his Laws, by his Lawyers, and (it might have been added) his
subjects, Laws and Lawyers by advice of Parliament, by the regulation of that
Court which gave life and birth to all Laws. In this Policy is comprised the
whole act of Sovereignty; for where the people are subject to the Law of the
Land and not to the will of the Prince, and where the Law is left to the
interpretation of sworn upright Judges, and not violated by power; and where
Parliaments superintend all, and in all extraordinary cases, especially betwixt
the King and Kingdom, do the faithful Offices of Umpirage, all things remain
in such a harmony, as I shall recommend to all good Princes.

The Parliament conceives that the King cannot apprehend any just fear from Sir
John Hotham, or interpret the mere shutting of Hull gates, and the sending away
of Arms and Ammunition in obedience to both Houses, to be any preparation for
War and Invasion against him at York, and therefore they resolve to raise
Forces against those Forces which the King raises to secure himself from Sir
John Hotham. The King hereupon charges the Parliament of levying War against
Him, under pretense of His levying War against them. This is matter of fact
and the World must judge whether the Kings preparations in the North be only
suitable to the danger of Sir John Hotham or no; and whether the Parliament be
in danger of the Kings strength there or no: Or whether is more probable at
this time, that the King is incensed against the Parliament, or the Parliament
against the King: or that the King is more intentive to assayl the Parliament,
or the Parliament the King. It Is true, the King abjures any intention of making
War against his Parliament; but what he intends against the malignant party
in or out of Parliament, is not expressed: and the King abjures invasive War
against them; but whether he think not himself first invaded already, is not
expressed; and the specifying of a faction in Parliament of some few malignants,
secures none; for none can plead force, and none ought to plead folly in
Treasons of this nature, and the major part of the Houses can neither plead
absence or dissent; and those which can, must not be their own purgators.
Besides, the act of Sir John Hotham is disputable; the King adjudges it
Treason, the Parliament adjudge it no Treason; and the King has not declared
whether he will refer this to the trial of the sword only, or to some other
trial; and if so, To what kind of trial the judgment of a Parliament shall
be submitted: If we call another Parliament to judge of this, so we may appeal
in infinitum; and why another should be cleerer then this, we cannot imagine:
If we could constitute a higher Court for this appeal, so we might do in
infinitum also; but we know no higher can be imagined: and if we appeal to a
lower, that were to invert the course of nature: and to confound all
Parliaments for ever; if we call all the Kingdom to judge of this, we do the
same thing as to proclaim Civil War, and to blow the Trumpet of general
confusion: And if we allow the King to be the sole, supreme competent Judge in
this case, we resign all into his hands, we give life's, liberties, Laws,
Parliaments, all to be held at mere discretion? For there is in the
interpretation of Law upon the last appeal, the same supremacy of power
requisite, as is in making it; And therefore grant the King supreme
interpreter, and it is all one, as if we granted him to be supreme maker of Law;
and grant him this, and we grant him to be above all limits, all conditions,
all humane bonds whatsoever. In this Intricacy therefore, where the King and
Parliament disagree, and judgment must be supreme, either in the one or other,
we must retire to ordinary justice, And there we see, if the King consent not
with the ordinary Judge, the Law thinks it fit, that the King subscribe, rather
then the Judge.

And if this satisfy not, We must retire to the principles of Nature, and
there search, whether the King or Kingdom be to be looked upon as the efficient,
and final cause, and as the proper Subject of all power. Neither is the oath
of supremacy endangered hereby; for he that ascribes more to the whole
universality, then to King; yet ascribes to the King a true supremacy of power,
and honor above all particulars: Nor is our allegiance temerated, For when the
Judge on the Bench delivers Law contrary to the Kings command; This is not the
same thing, as to proceed against the Kings person, upon any judgment given
against him. The King as to His own person, is not to be forcibly repelled in
any ill doing^ nor is He accountable for ill done, Law has only a directive,
but no coactive force upon his person; but in all irregular acts where no
personal force is, Kings may be disobeyed, their unjust commands may be
neglected, not only by communities, but also by single men sometimes. Those men
therefore that maintain, That all Kings are in all things and commands (as well
where personal resistance accompanies, as not) to be obeyed, as being like
Gods, unlimitable, and as well in evil, as in good unquestionable, are sordid
flatterers. And those which allow no limits but directive only, And those no
other but divine and natural; And so make all Princes as vast in power as the
Turk, (for He is subject to the directive force of God, and natures Laws;) and
so allow subjects a dry right without all remedy, are almost as stupid as the
former. And those lastly, That allow humane Laws to obleage Kings more then
directively, in all cases where personal violence is absence, and yet allow no
Judges of those Laws, but the King Himself, run into absurdities as gross as
the former.

I come now to those seven doctrines, and positions, which the King by way of
recapitulation lays open as so offensive -- And they run thus:

1. THat the Parliament has an absolute indisputable power of declaring Law, So
that all the right of the King and people, depends upon their pleasure. It has
been answered, That this power must rest in them, or in the King, or in some
inferior Court, or else all suites must be endless, and it can no where rest
more safely then in Parliament.

2. That Parliaments are bound to no precedents. Statutes are not binding to
them, Why then should precedents? Yet there is no obligation stronger then the
Justice and Honor of a Parliament.

3. That they are Parliaments, and may judge of public necessity without the
King, and dispose of anything. They may not desert the King, but being deserted
by the King, when the Kingdom is in distress, They may judge of that
distress, and relieve it, and are to be accounted by the virtue of
representation, as the whole body of the State.

4. That no Member of Parliament ought to be troubled for treason, etc. without
leave. This is intended of suspicions only, And when leave may be seasonably
had, and when competent accusers appear not in the impeachment.

5. That the Sovereign power resides in both Houses of Parliament, the King
having no negative voice. This power is not claimed as ordinary; nor to any
purpose, But to save the Kingdom from ruin, and in case where the King is so
seduced, as that He preferres dangerous men, and prosecutes His loyal Subjects.

6. That levying forces against the personal commands of the King, (though
accompanied with his presence) is not levying war against the King: But war
against His authority, though not person, is war against the King? If this
were not so, The Parliament seeing a seduced King, ruining Himself, and the
Kingdom could not save both, but must stand and look on.

7. That according to some Parliaments, they may depose the King? It Is denied,
That any King was deposed by a free Parliament fairly elected.

To stand in comparison with these, I shall recite some such positions as the
Kings papers offer to us; And they follow thus.

1. THat regal power is so derived from God and the Law, as that it has no
dependence upon the trust, and consent of man; and the King is accountable
therefore to God and His other Kingdoms, not to this; And it is above the
determination of Parliaments, and by consequence boundless.

2. That the King is supreme indefinitely, viz. As well universis, as singulis.

3. That the King has such a propriety in His Subjects, Towns, Forts, etc. As
is above the propriety of the State, and not to be seized by the Parliament,
though for the public safety.

4. That so far as the King is trusted, He is not accountable how He
performs, So that in all cases the Subject is remediless.

5. That the being of Parliaments is merely of grace, So that the King might
justly have discontinued them, and being summoned, they are limited by the
writ, and that ad consilium Only, and that but in quibusdam arduis, And if they
pass the limits of the Writ, they may be imprisoned. That if the King desert
them, they are a void assembly, and no honor due to them, nor power to save
the Kingdom, That Parliamentary privileges are no where to be read of, And so
their representation of this whole Kingdom is no privilege, nor adds no
Majesty, nor authority to them. That the major part in Parliament is not
considerable, when so many are absent, or dissent. That the major part is no
major part, Because the fraud, and force of some few overrules them. That
Parliaments may do dishonorable things, nay treasonable: Nay, That this has
been so blinded by some few malignants, That they have abetted treason in Sir
John Hotham, Trampled upon all Law, and the Kings prerogative, And sought to
inslave the whole Kingdom under the Tyranny of some few, And sought the
betraying of Church, and State, And to the same erected an upstart Authority in
the new Militia, and levied war upon the King, under pretense that He levies
war upon them. That Parliaments cannot declare Law, but in such and such
particular cases legally brought before them. That Parliaments are
questionable, and tryable elsewhere.

These things, we all see, tend not only to the desolation of this Parliament,
but to the confusion of all other, And to the advancing of the King to a higher
power over Parliaments, then ever He had before over inferior Courts.
Parliaments have hitherto been Sanctuaries to the people, and banks against
Arbitrary tyranny; But now the mere breath of the King, blasts them in an
instant; and how shall they hereafter secure us, when they cannot now secure
themselves? Or how can we expect justice, when the mere imputation of treason,
without hearing, trial, or judgment, shall sweep away a whole Parliament; nay
all Parliaments for ever? And yet this is not yet the depth of our misery, For
that private Council which the King now adheres to, and preferres before
Parliaments, will still enforce upon our understandings, That all these
doctrines, and positions tend to the perfection of Parliaments; And all the
Kings forces in the North, to the protection of Law and liberty. I find my
Reason already captivated, I cannot further --

FINIS.
