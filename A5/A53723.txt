the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

For the use of the Congregation at Fordham, in the County of Essex.

TO My loving Neighbors and Christian Friends, at FORDHAM.
Brethren,
MY hearts desire and request unto God for you is, that ye may be saved: I
say the truth in Christ also, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in
the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness, and continual sorrow in my
heart, for them amongst you, who as yet walk disorderly, and not as beseems
the Gospel, little laboring to acquaint themselves with the mystery of
godliness; for many walk, of whom I have told you often weeping, and now tell
you again with sorrow, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose
end is destruction, whose God is their belly, who mind earthly things. You
know (Brethren) how I have been amongst you, and in what manner, for these two
years past; and how I have kept back nothing (to the utmost of the dispensation
to me committed) that was profitable unto you; but have showed you and taught
you, publicly, and from house to house, testifying to all, repentance toward
God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Now with what sincerity this has
bin by me performed; with what issue and success by you received, God the
righteous Judge will one day declare; for before him, must both you, and I
appear, to give an account of the dispensation of the glorious Gospel amongst
us: in the mean while, the desire of my heart is, to be s^rvant to the least
of you in the work of the Lord. And that in any way, which I can conceive
profitable unto you either in your persons or your families. Now amongst my
indevours in this kind, after the Ordinance of public Preaching the Word,
there is not, I conceive, any more needful, (as all will grant that know the
estate of this place, how taught of late days, how full of grossly ignorant
persons) then Catechizing, which has caused me to set aside some hours for
the compiling of these following, which also I have procured to be Printed
merely because the least part of the Parish are able to read it in writing, my
intention in them being, principally, to hold out those necessary truths,
wherein you have been in my Preaching more fully instructed: as they are, the
use of them I shall briefly present unto you.

1. The lesser Catechism may be so learned of the younger sort, that they may
be ready to answer to every question thereof.

2. The greater will call to mind much of what has been taught you in
public, especially concerning the person a^^ Offices of Jesus Christ.

3. Out of that you may have help to instruct your families in the lesser,
being so framed for the most part, that a Chapter of the one, is spent in
unfolding a question of the other.

4. The texts of Scripture quoted, are d^ligently to be sought out and
pondered, that you may know indeed whether these things are so.

5. In ^eading the Word, you may have light into the meaning of many places, by
considering what they are here produced to confirm.

6. I have been sparing in the doctrine of the Sacraments, because I have
already been so frequent in examinations about them.

7. The handling of moral duties I have wholly omitted, because by Gods
assistance I intend for you a brief explication of the Lords Prayer, and the
ten Commandments, with some Articles of the Creed, not unfolded in these, by
themselves, by the way of Question and Answer.

Now in all this as the pains has been mine, so I pray that the benefit may
be yours* and the praise his, to whom alone any good, that is in this or any
thing else, is to be ascribed. Now the God of heaven continue that peace,
love, and amity amongst our selves, which hitherto has been unshaken, in these
divided times, and grant that the Scepter and Kingdom of his Son may be
gloriously advanced in your hearts, that the things which concern your peace,
may not be hidden from your eyes in this your day: which is the daily prayer of

From my Study, Septem. the last, Your servant in the work of the Lord, J.O.
