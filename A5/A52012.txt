The married wives Complaint of her unkind Husband, OR, A Caution for Maids to
beware how they marry,
Here you may see in midst of all the strife,
A cross-graind Husband, and Obedient wife:
Patience perforce cures a Mad Dog they say,
So now she is bound, she knows she must obey.
To a very pleasant new tune, or, jonny armstrong, or True love rewarded with
Loyalty.


COme all young Maids that are to Wed,
mark well the words that I shall say,
Before you come to the Marriage bed,
for when you are bound you must obey.
Whilst I did lead a single life,
I had my pleasure every day,
I never knew what belonged to strife,
But now I am bound I must obey.
I wish I had a Maid remained,
milking the Cows, and making Hay,
But it is too late to call what is past,
for now I am bound I must obey.
Since that I have been made a Wife,
I am tormented day by day,
Which makes me weary of my life,
but as I am bound I must obey.


Early in the morning when I do rise,
to make my Cheese, and set my UUhey,
Leaving my Husband in bed alone,
for as I am bound I must obey.
It Is almost Noon when he does rise,
then to the Alehouse he takes his way,
And leaves me at home to eat barley-bread,
for as I am bound I must obey.
If I go beg of him with tears,
and say good Husband come away,
The pots then fyes about my ears,
for as I am bound I must obey.
He cries you baggage get you home,
and mind your knitting there I say,
For I will make you for to know,
that as you are bound you must obey.
The second Part, to the same Tune,


THen am I glad for to be gone,
for to avoid a further fray,
And to my neighbors make my moan
for as I am bound I must obey.
It Is late at night when he comes home,
reeling and staggering all the way,
His wits is gone, and his money's spent,
but as I am bound I must obey.
Then I cry sweetheart lets go to bed
the Moon is down, and it is almost day,
I Will tie a Napkin about thy head,
for as I am bound I must obey.
I had far rather lie alone,
when he is drunk, I dare to say;
Snorting, and Snoreing is all that is done,
yet as I am bound I must obey.
'Twould make a woman almost mad,
to be thus vexed night and day,
But remedy none can be had,
for as I am bound I must obey.
Next morning when that he does rise,
instead of work, he goes to play
Thus daily he my patience tries,
but as I am bound I must obey.


Small Children God has sent us three*
I wash and mend them every day,
My case is hard, as hard may be,
but now I am bound I must obey.
A fair Estate he has me spent,
and sent it packing all away,
But it is too late now to repent,
for as I am bound I must obey.
When first we both together came,
then we had gold and silver store,
But the gold is gone, and the silver's spent*
and now we must to work for more.
He may go far yet turn at last,
for so the Proverb old does say,
And make amends for all that is past,
but as I am bound I must obey.
Let Maidens all beware in time,
example take by me, I say,
I was, as you are, in my prime,
but now I am bound I must obey.
Far better had I buried been,
then thus for to be cast away:
Then had I never sorrow seen,
but now I am bound I must obey.
Finis.
