Most Gracious Lord.
YOur Highnesses last Conference with me at the time of my traveling through
those Countries, about the true and nearest way to attain unto perfection in
Physic, is still fresh in my memory: And upon that Quaere, I proposed unto
your Highness for answer, the golden Doctrine of the sharp-sighted Philosopher
Helmont, sunt videlicet Sulphura quaedam, quibus correctis atque perfectis,
tota morborum cohors auscultat. The truth of this Doctrine I did then
demonctrate with strong Arguments of the Anima Antimonii, and if my occasions
had permitted me to remain there for some longer time, I would have cleared the
same by experimental proof; Now although this great Encomium attributed by
Helmont unto some Sulphurs, may with truth be given unto the Sulphur of
Antimony, yet the Tincture of the Copper deserves it much more, as having
obtained of Nature a higher degree of Nobility than the former; and and
therefore its Anima is called Sulphur Philosophorum by Paracelsus, Basilius
Valentinus, and others, in regard of its great Virtue and Power in relieving
the sick in their pains and great extremities, which many Physicians clearly
apprehended from the Writings of Helmont, and therefore greedily sought for the
same, but none almost hitherto found it. Hence great complaint is made by them
every where, that they cannot attain unto this great Mystery, nor sever the
Golden Tincture from its Leprous Body. And therefore I counted it to be my duty
as a Christian, to set upon the Table that little light of my knowledge in this
Mystery, which God in his Mercy bestowed upon me, to the end that all that are
chosen for it by God and born to it by Nature, may see my gift, and look into
the matter it self, also together with me may find out this precious Jewel of
Health, and be partakers of the same, and thence much profit may arise unto the
sick. In regard therefore, that your Highness was at that time well pleased
with my Elucidation concerning the Tincture of Antimony, I thought good to
dedicate this also to your Highness, to the end that you may perceive the
Wonders of God in the Copper also, and thence praise His holy Name: Hoping that
your Highness will Graciously accept of this my Lucubration, and affection to
serve you. And I heartily commend your Highness to the continuation of the
mercy of God, remaining

Concerning the MYSTERY Of the Sulphur Philosophorum.
CAP. I.
The Occasion of Writing this Book.
GOd in his great mercy having lighted unto us unworthy Men in this Age a
special clear light in Physic, to the great comfort of the sick, by the highly
favored John Baptist Helmont, and the same having been also acknowledged and
highly esteemed by many hundred truth-loving Physicians, who therefore have
diligently read and pondered his relict deeply grounded Writings: Yet at length
almost all do complain of the obscurity of those Books, especially in what
concerns the preparation of those High Medicines, and above all touching the
Tincture or Sulphur of Copper, which every one deemed, and deservedly too, of
all the most necessary in Physic; Hence by many correspondencies, one Friend
sought of another the clearing of this secret, and every one busied himself
extremely for the getting of this golden Arcanum; of which disease I my self
also lay sick a long time: for having diligently read the learned Books of our
Philosopher, and not being able to frame any conception from thence, how to
unriddle this Mystery, I resolved with my self to attain unto it by the sifting
of Wise and Understanding Men; and therefore declined no difficulty of
traveling into diverse Kingdoms, though often with great hazard of my life,
where I enquired for experienced men in this secret Art, and conferred with
them about this high and weighty treasure of Health, but could find none, who
could loosen this fast-tyed Sulphur Philosophorum, or give me as much as the
least hint of it; Yea even of the most famous I found not a few, who were not
able clearly to sever the Anima from Antimony, much less from Copper.
Whereupon I was forced to take another Resolution, and so followed the faithful
Doctrine of our Philosopher, left unto us in his book de Venatione scientiarum,
and sought the truth of Nature no more from men, but from the Creator and
Beginner of Nature, by my humble prayers, whereunto I joined a singular
industry in reading our Philosophers Writings, accurately observing his words
and meaning, and comparing one place with another, and then also worked
diligently, and at length truth appeared unto me by the blessing of God. Now he
that has been sick, being best sensible of the condition of another which is
sick of the same disease, and not being ignorant of the great longing search
and expectation for this Sulphur Philosophorum by the ignorant, and such as go
astray, I thought my self bound in Christian charity to communicate unto my
brethren, what I discovered through the grace of God, with much labor, time
and expenses, and clearly to unfold the way which I went my self, and thereby
attained unto this knowledge, to the end that they may follow this little light
set up for them, and thereby penetrate into this Mystery, and do good unto
their neighbor in his sickness; also that the name of God may be praised by
many in his wonders, and much glory may redound unto him, which is the fountain
of all good gifts.

CAP. II.
Opening the Virtue, by which a Mineral Anima, or Sulphur, is to be severed
from its Body.
IF we desire Fundamentally to know, by what means the Anima is to be separated
from the hard Coagulated Metallic Bodies, as Gold, Copper, Steel, etc. We must
first enquire, whereby not only common Sulphur, but also the Sulphurs of
Minerals, which are but half-coagulated bodies, are loosened or dissolved; to
the end that having a through knowledge of the same, thereby as by steps we may
ascend higher, and advance to the separation of those much faster coagulated
Sulphurs: for all the Metallic and Mineral Sulphurs being thoroughly of one and
the same Nature, and called by the Philosophers the Element of Fire, and being
of a Fiery Nature, it must needs follow, that their solution must proceed from
one and the same ground; in regard that, as to their first rise, they are of
the like Substance and Nature, just as an old Man and a newborn child are
quite of one and the same substance, only that the one is more perfect than the
other; and therefore for the finding out of the solution of the firmly
coagulated Metallic Sulphurs, we must first enquire after the ground and means
to unlock the meaner Sulphurs, for in this manner I have traced the truth and
found it. First then, considering what it is which radically unlocketh common
Sulphur, we find, that Oil, and all that is of a fat and Fiery Nature does open
the same, as being of a like fiery substance, and discovers to our very eyes
its otherwise occult blood-red soul. Which though it be a common thing, and
daily practiced by many, yet it is of such a depth and weight, that from this
very source springs forth the solution of all Metallic souls, yea of the
gold it self, as you will hear afterward. Therefore if we pretend to be
Disciples of the Philosophers, we must with other eyes than those of an Idiot
look upon Sulphur, when by boiling with Oil it is mollified in such sort, that
its inward red Tinctur is turned outward; The common crew contents himself with
this, that after they have done with their boiling, the same does take away the
itch and scab, cures wounds, and the bruised and inflamed limbs, and
performs other wholesome operations: But a searcher of the hidden wisdom goes
deeper to the ground, and inquireth, whence it comes, that of all things the
Oil only has power to open the Sulphur so sweetly, and so naturally, turning
its interior outward, whereas the strongest corrosive cannot do it; and upon
due consideration we find, that this solution proceeds from the likeness or
identity of Oil and Sulphur, viz. that the Oil or fat, as being a fiery thing,
does cover, lay hold on, and embrace the Sulphur as a like fiery substance, and
so softneth the same, and opens it to its very inmost Center, which is done
by Sympathy, like loving its like, and imparting their Virtue to each other. In
so much, that Oil, as a fiery moisture is the right foundation and source, from
whence the opening of all Mineral and Metallic Sulphurs does flow: Now if we
go on from common Sulphur to the other Sulphur of Minerals, which are advanced
to a pretty hard coagulation by the coction of Nature, and compare the foresaid
experience, we find, that though Oil has no power to sever and open the
Embryonat Sulphur of any Mineral, as being too weak for this performance, yet
for all that, the solution must proceed from the same ground, if it shall be
radical, and consonant, and friendly unto Nature; but in regard that the
Minerals are fast locked up, and so do not yield to such a gentle power as that
of the Oil, therefore the power of the Oily substance must be exalted and
increased in its fieriness, and then it will open and sever the Sulphur from
Minerals as easily, yet with more expedition than Oil does unlock the common
Sulphur: This exaltation of the fiery power and quality in Oils must also be
done by its like, if we will work according to Nature, and not contrary
thereunto; which is performed by a burning fire, which by its fiery and
vehement power turns the Oily substance into a fiery salt, which salt not
only retains its former Oily mollifying power, but also is highly exalted in
the same: for wood, which is full of Oil, being thrown into the fire and burnt,
though the greatest part of the Oil be consumed by the fire, in regard that of
its wast or consumption the flame and heat has its rise, yet a great part
thereof (which cannot be burnt in such have, the volatile salt, which also is
in the wood, besides the Oil, hindering the same, and melting together) by the
sharp and vehement power or burning fieriness, is turned into a very fiery,
fixed, Oily salt, which is called Alcali, or Lixivial salt, whereof the common
people make their lie: and this salt has still perfectly its former softning
Oily property, only that by the fieriness it is translated from a Volatile to
a fixed condition; yea is grown far more fiery and powerful, than it was
before: Now if you will know, whither this fiery salt be still a true Oily
substance, then put some common Sulphur and some of this salt and water in a
pot, and boil them a little, and you will see, that the Sulphur will in like
manner melt in it, and yield its red Tincture, as if it had been done with
Oil, yea with more expedition, because it is now much stronger in its softning
fieriness, than it was before, being yet in the form of an Oil. Now as this
fiery salt is nothing else, but a fiery Oil much exalted in its virtue, so it
has the more vehement power now to lay hold on, and to unlock that, which
before, being yet an Oil, it could not possibly overcome; so that being in this
exalted condition it has now the power to take Minerals asunder, and to
separate their Soul or Sulphur. To perform the same yet easier and with more
expedition, such a fiery Alcali may be yet further exalted in its fieriness, by
being mixed with the like fiery things, and so burnt together; such a fiery
thing is unquench't lime, which by the strong power of the burning fire has
attained to its great fieriness, and so is able to communicate the same by fire
unto the Alcali's. Take therefore well purified Lixivial salt or salt of
Tartar, which is the fieriest of all, mix it with lime, Calcine it strongly for
the space of a day, then Lixiviate it again from the lime, your Alcali will be
notably increased in its fieriness, and have then power to loosen the Sulphur
from Minerals, and sever it from their bodies with much expedition; as you may
see for example in Antimony, the chiefest of all Minerals, which being made
into fine powder, and mixed with the foresaid fiery salt, and water powered on,
and so letting it rest in a warm place for some days, stirring it about
oftentimes in a day, the fiery Alcali then attracteth the Sulphur by Sympathy
and so looseneth it, and uniteth it self therewith: the extraction decanted and
filtred, and Acid things powered into it, the Sulphur of Antimony will
precipitate of a fair Orange color, and burn like other Sulphur, but that
which falls last of all, is best and purest. By these two steps, viz. the
solution of common Sulphur in Oils, and the severing of Embryonate Sulphurs
from Minerals in a fiery Alcali; I went up higher to the loosening of Metallic
Sulphurs, they being of the same substance with Mineral Sulphurs; and as in a
clear glass, by the Light of Nature I saw, that in like manner as Oil was not
of efficacy sufficient to sever the Sulphur from Minerals, but that it was
needful to advance the Oil first to a far higher degree of fieriness, before
it was capable to perform that work: So likewise the Metallic Sulphurs, being
faster tied to their Mercurial bodies, and advanced to a far harder coagulation
than Minerals, require a much more penetrating fire, then the fixed Alcalies
are, but yet in regard that the Sulphurs are of the same substance, their
solution must spring still from the same source, and there wants nothing else,
but that this fiery salt be made yet more penetrative, more softning, more
vehement and powerful, which must be obtained by freeing those fiery Salts and
Alcalies from their gross corporeousnesse, raising them by the strong force of
the fire, and making of them a penetrating, fiery, volatile spirit, being not
only of such a fiery nature and force as before, but also much increased in
its penetrating and mollifying quality, because it is freed from all gross
ligaments, and turned into a through-spiritual, very fiery, volatile Water.
According to this knowledge I worked, and had good success, in so much that
the Sulphurs of Metals readily yielded to such a fiery volatile spirit,
delivering up thereunto all their virtue and power, as hereafter shall be
mentioned. So the sum of this ground is this, that for common Sulphurs, Oils
for Embryonat Sulphurs, the fixed fiery Alcalies; and for Metallic Sulphurs,
yea for that of Gold it self, the Volatilized Alcalies, as a spiritual, very
fiery, penetrating Water are required for their central solution,
mollification and liquefaction: Let none think it strange, that I said, that
Gold it self must yield i blood-red Soul or Sulphur to this fiery penetrating
Spirit, for Experience has taught me so, and shows forth the same daily,
notwithstanding that the deeply Learned Philosopher Cormopolita in his Preface
of his XII. tract. does hold the contrary, and many others at this day do count
it impossible.

CHAP III.
That the Copper is to be first prepared before it can part with its Sulphur.
HEre will appear the reason, why not only our Philosopher, but also many
others before him, have dignified the Sulphur Cupri with the glorious name and
title of Sulphur Philosophorum, and owned the same indeed for such; truly, not
only by reason of its great virtue and power, but also because of its secret
and difficult preparation, which the wise reserved very secret and only amongst
themselves; which also remained concealed unto this time, and will remain so to
those which love Gold more then God, although I do clear it more than any
before me; for God keeps his hand always upon his Mysteries, and suffers not
swine to be pertakers of those noble pearls, which our Philosopher de febribus
cap. 14.. 9. witnesses, saying, Paucis absolvi secretum, quod medicum
nobilitat: at istud parasse pro prima vice est ingentis operae, pendetque ejus
directio a manu ejus cui debetur omnis honos, quia parvulis revelat ejusmodi
arcana quae mundus nescit, and idcirco vilipendit. Therefore You must not
think, that it is such a Trifle and Easy matter to get the Gold-like Tincture
of Copper; for not only the Menstruum which is required for to extract the
Anima, viz. the Alcali Volatile, but also the preparation of the Copper are such
Mysteries as are unknown hitherto, and whereof all self-grown Physicians are
utterly ignorant. For first the Copper must be turned into a Vitriol, not after
the common known way, which has no place here, but after a far secreter way,
via long occultiori, says our Philosopher, cap. 8. de Lithiasi.. 21. and this
Vitriolificatio Cupri is the chiefest preparation which of all has been kept
most secret: Secondly this Vitriolum Cupri Philosoph. must be distilled over in
such a manner, that all the Copper come over in the form of a green spirit,
which also is no common way of working, yea, was in such high esteem with
Paracelsus and Basilius Valentinus, that they called this green spirit the
third pillar of Physic: Thirdly, this grass-green spirit must be freed from
its corrosive, which also was only known to the wise, but now has been clearly
described by our Philosopher: Then fourthly, and not before the Sulphur may be
separated by an Alcali Volatile; which knot is tied hardest of all, and our
Philosopher mentioned it not expressly, but only left to be guessed at, and
picked out of his writings, by the elect Disciples of the Philosophers, which
now is clearly delineated by me. Fifthly, and last of all, the separated soul
must be coagulated and fixed, which though it be of all, the easiest and
meanest operation, yet it will be difficult enough for him that wants
understanding and discretion, to advance this noble Sulphur to its perfect
maturity, in such a way as is consonant unto Nature.

CAP. IV.
Informing how to make the Philosophers Vitriol of Copper.
ALthough for extraction of the Anima of the Copper the greatest and chiefest
requisite is the Alcali Vetile, yet the same is not alone sufficient; for
though it be poured upon Calcined Copper, (as I my self did at first, but in
vain) yet it cannot sever its gold-like Anima; the reason is, that by the hard
coagulation performed by Nature, and the fusion by fire which followed
thereupon, the anima Cupri has been shut up into death, and so quite turned
inwards, in which sense Cosmopolita says very well, quod fusio metallorum sit
eorum mors, and our Philosopher de Lithiasi c. 8.. 4. dum liquatur, concluditur
omnis vis medica, sigillaturque, imo introvertitur sic, etc. and therefore the
Anima must be turned outward again, and the melted metal must as it were rise
from death, and hence our Philosopher calls it sulphur resurgens and
gloriosum, as being freed from all its hard corporeous ligaments; so that it is
apparent, that this preparation of the Copper is no less necessary, nor of no
less moment than the preparation of the fiery volatile spirit (which is the fit
Menstruum for extraction) it self: and therefore also the Philosophers kept the
former as secret as this, until our faithful and well meaning Philosopher
helped us into the track, informing us, that this preparation or fitting of the
Copper must be done by Salt armoniack, whereof his doctrine in his tract called
Duumviratus. 9. is this, fit enim legitimum, and quod Philosophorum (Sulphur)
vocant e spiritu viridi Vitrioli, qui per repetitam cohobationem, ultima ignis
tortura expressus and insigniter volatilis, coagulatur atque fixatur, quod
praesat vulgaris sal Armoniacus qui inde post modum auferri debet per spiritus
vini repetitas destillationes. Now this being to be done by Salt-Armoniac, you
may peradventure think to make use of the same as it is in it self, as I my
self also conceived so at first, and sublimed the Copper many times with salt
Armoniack, but all in vain. And therefore at length after many frustraneous
labors, I begun more accurately to heed our Philosophers far-reaching words,
teaching that the Vitriol of the Copper must be made into a very highly volatile
spirit; consequently the Salt-armoniack it self, because it is to perform
this, must first be turned into such an extraordinary volatile Spirit; for how
could the Copper possibly be transformed into such a very volatile spirit, if
that same which is to transform it so, be not first it self such a volatile
Spirit? And therefore the Salt-armoniack must first be turned into a very
volatilspirit, and then by the means thereof the Copper turned into Vitriol;
But you must not think (as I did at first; but my endeavors proved addle) to
take natural, or by art prepared blew Vitriol of Copper to sublime it with Salt
armoniack, and so turn it into a Spirit: for this is as much lost labor, as
to take the Copper filed or calcined, in regard that the spirit of Vitriol or
any other corrosive spirit, which made the Vitriol of Copper, do not only not
serve for this purpose, but also are noxious and a great hindrance; in so much,
that if one would according to our Philosophers Doctrine extract the Tincture
or Sulphur, either of Naturally grown or artificially made common blew Vitriol
of Copper, he must first dissolve the Vitriol in Water, then precipitate the
Metallic Substance with an Alcali, and free the same quite from its corosive,
so that not the least of this remain with it, and then he must afresh make this
precipitated and dried Calx into Vitriol by spirit of Salt Armoniack; else he
would get nothing; for such difference there is betwixt the common and the
Philosophers Vitriol, as betwixt black and white, as you will hear by and by.
Now concerning the transformation of the Salt Armoniack into a Volatile spirit,
the Reader must not think, that the same is to be done after a common and known
way; or that such a way has been known hitherto: as that the Salt armoniack is
to be distilled with Wheat Flour, as some do, who perversely count the Acid
water that comes over for the true spirit of Salt Armoniack, it being nothing
else but the acidity of the flower, mixed with some atoms of Salt armoniack,
after which also, soon all the Salt Armoniack follows, and sublimeth in its
former weight; for all Vegetables yield such a sour spirit when they are
distilled: Also the fiery urinous salt, which is got by means of the salt of
Tartar, or any other Alcali, is not that spirit which the Philosophers require
for this work, in regard that the same is but the smaller part of the Salt
Armoniack, but the bigger part remains in the bottom, in so much that the
foresaid salt is wrongfully called spirit of Salt Armoniack; for the
denomination of a thing consisting of two parts, as the Salt Armoniack does,
pertains always and chiefly to the bigger or greater part, as they are wont
to say, a potiori part fit denominatio; Now experience witnesses, that if you
take a pound of Salt Armoniack and mix it with an Alcali, that about three
ounces, or three and a half ounces do rise of the urinous Salt (which indeed is
no spirit, but only a volatile Salt) and more then twelve ounces remain with the
Alcali in the bottom, which twelve ounces, as being the greater part merit
rather the name of Salt Armoniack, then those three ounces and a half which
sublimed; hence also the wise always mean it of the greater part which
remained in the bottom, which they forced into a volatile spirit to serve their
turn; and the same experience has taught me, for I saw that the urinous Salt
is useless for this matter, not being able to produce that which the wise
require, and so sought and found it in the greater part viz. that the said
greater part, which after the separation of the urinous salt, remains in the
bottom with the Alcali, being forced over by a strong fire according to Art,
you will get not only a Volatile, but also a double spirit: Very Volatile I say,
for it will come over in Balneo, and is able to make other bodies to be very
Volatile: Double it is, for when the Urinous Salt severed it self thereform, it
embraced then and united with the Alcali, from which it is not to be severed
but by a very vehement fire, and then it forces part of the Alcali over with
it self, because of its intimate union therewith, in so much that without the
same it cannot come over; so there arises a double or satiated spirit, which
satiated its hungry corroding nature with the Alcali; and so does no more
corrode other bodies, nor seeks to insinuate it self into them, being
satiated already with the Alcali; as much as its corrosive had need of; hence
this double satiated very Volatile spirit is of a wonderful nature, and
unlocketh Metallic bodies after a far other fashion than the common corrosives
do; for these being hungry and desirous to satiate their corrosive, do fall
upon the Metals with great fury and noise, and do corrode them and adhere unto
them outwardly: but this double corrosive, being satiated already, does not
corrode the Metal, nor seeks for to dwell with it as others do, but does
mollify it, and adhereth not outwardly thereunto, nor performs its operation
suddenly like the others, but gently in some days, penetrating to the very
inmost of the Metal, and turning outward what was locked and sealed up in its
inmost center, by the virtue of its double nature, wherein the Metal melts
like ice in water. Therefore be careful and diligent to make this spirit of the
Salt Armoniack; and be not dismayed therefore, that much Labor is required for
it, and special care, but think upon the end, that the same will recompense
thee with gladness and joy: If you hit this right, then you have overcome the
greatest and difficultest point in this business, and the rest will be but as
it were a play or sport.

Take therefore this very Volatile Spirit, and pour it upon the filings of fine
Copper, and in a close glasse-Vessel in a gentle heat, digest it for manydayes,
and the Metal will leasurely melt in it, and the spirit will be very green of
the Metal: continue this solution with fresh spirit, until your metal be all
dissolved; then coagulate it, and you will get a very green Vitriol, which as
it differs from the common blew Vitriol in color, so likewise in Nature and
Virtues; for the blew Vitriolum Cupri is very bitter and nauseous in taste, but
this as sweet as sugar of Lead; the other causes vehement vomits, but this
strengthens Nature, begets rest, takes away pain: it may be given even to
the smallest children, and has such Verture in Physic, that it is to be
admired. The other being Calcined, is a harsh and hard substance, but this is
fufile in the fire like wax, it is almost like unto Rozin, and may be cut like
a gumm; for its balsamic soul is totally turned outward by this secret double
corrosive, and therefore also does it smell so fragrantly, like Odoriferous
spice, especially being dissolved in spirit of Wine (in which it will melt
totally and very suddenly) and digested for some days, to say nothing of other
many more properties for brevities sake. Lo now, what great difference there is
betwixt the Philosophers Vitriol, and that which commonly is made of Copper,
truly as much as betwixt white and black: And as its virtue is great as for
inward medicine, so its efficacy is wonderful and not to be commended
sufficiently in Chirurgy, by reason of its Balsamic sweetness, whereby in
green wounds, dangerous ulcers, and incurable tumors it shows forth so great
power, that it shameth all commonly known ointments, balsomes, oils, plasters
and poultises: Of which I will prescribe you a plaster and an ointment, whose
mighty operation you will admire, and have reason to rejoice at it in many
dangerous Symptoms:

The plaster is composed in this manner: Take Sulphur of Antimony, such as
above taught, put it into a Phiol, pour upon it Linseed-Oyl new drawn, that it
reach some inches over, let it boil moderately together for a whole day, and
the Linseed-Oyl will turn as red as blood, and is the true Balsome of Sulphur
in Chirurgie: this Balsome put into a Copper vessel; if you have one pound of
it, add unto it half a pound of Litharge in fine powder, boil it, still
stirring it about, until the Litharge be dissolved; then add of grease (be it
of Men, Hogs, Geese, or Butter also, etc. according to your use) half a pound,
and of the sweet Vitriol of Copper one ounce and a half, and as much wax as is
needful for consistency, and make it into a plaster, which by reason of its
great Virtues may well be called the golden plaster. The Ointment make thus:
Take of Honey well clarified four Ounces; of the juice of Polygonum latifolium
twelve Ounces; of the sweet Vitriol of Copper, two Ounces; boil all gently
together, until it be almost as thick as an Ointment; then add of the best
Saffran made into fine powder, half an Ounce: take it straight from the fire,
mix the Saffran well with it, so that it be very well incorporated therewith,
and it is done. If in those cases where fat things may be used, you will add
some of the former Balsome of Sulphur, and incorporate it well, it will be so
much the better. And these two things being well prepared, and rightly
administered according to Art, will be very useful for you in assisting the
distressed, and gain you much credit, as you will know by experience.

CAP. V.
A farther explication concerning the Vitriolification of the Copper, and of
the secrets of the Salt-Armoniack.
ALthough I have sufficiently described all that pertains to the preparation
of the Vitriol of Copper, yet the proposed matter may seem to the Reader partly
obscure, and partly impossible, especially because I make mention of such a
sorts of spirits, (such as double and satiated) whereof has not been heard,
nor read in any Author hitherto, so that this my explication may peradventure
be counted a fable, as if I offered violence unto the Philosophers Doctrine,
when they do so highly commend the Salt Armoniack for to unlock and prepare
Metals and Minerals, perverting their words to another sense, which they never
intended. For to prevent this suspicion, and to make the matter so clear and
palpable to the Reader, that he may see the bare and naked ground of this
secret, I will so digest and open unto him to the nature and whole substance of
the Salt Armoniack, that he cannot choose but agree thereunto, and acknowledge
the truth of the matter: First, let none take offense, that I produce a new
sort of spirits, or that I name them by a new name, in regard, that the Salt
Armoniack of its self is nothing else but a double and satiated spirit, for
else it could never have such great Virtues to fit and prepare Metals and
Minerals, and so readily elevate, and take them asunder, if it were not a
satiated and double spirit, which with a double force performs, what no
single corrosive possibly can do. But that the Salt Armoniack is a satiated and
double Spirit, the Mechanica will teach you; for if you take the spirit of
Urine (which to speak properly is no spirit, but only a fiery salt, in regard
that being rectified and severed from all Heterogeneous Phlegm, it is and
remains always a Volatile and fiery salt, and no spirit) and pour it upon
Vitriol, the corrosive in the Vitriol will unite presently with this fiery
salt, and leave its Metallic Body, wherein it dwelled before, and so lays
hold on this fiery salt, having more inclination to this, than to the metallic
Body: this Vitriol, which is impregnated with the so called Spirit of Urine,
being put into a Retort and forced by fire, presently there will appear a dry,
Volatile double salt, tasting neither of spirit of Vitriol, nor of spirit of
Urine, because they worked into one another, and changed themselves on both
sides, which action and reaction may well be called saturation, where the one
satiateth, feeds, and rests it self in the other, both quietly dwelling
together and in each other, and therefore two being united, there is virtus
unita, and their force so much the greater, as they say, virtus unita fortior,
for from this united Virtue proceeds the great power, which the Salt
Armoniack has in preparing of Metallic Bodies. The foresaid double salt being
examined, you will find that its taste is no other then that of the Salt
Armoniack, and that it has the same operation in Physic also. Now after the
same manner, as you have heard of the spirit of Vitriol and the salt of Urine,
arises also the common Salt Armoniack and from the same ground, only that
instead of Vitriol they take common salt, and instead of the salt of Urine,
they take common Urine that suffered no separation, and other things, which
contain the like Volatile fiery salt, as Urine does: as soon as these things are
mixed together, they presently work one into another, each one lays hold of
the other; insomuch that this dry mixture being forced by fire, the Volat il
salt by reason of its Volatility is necessitated to rise, but being intimately
united with the salt, it cannot rise alone, but forces the spirit of salt to
go along, and so both ascend, as a double satiated spirit or spiritual Salt;
and if you doubt still whither it be so or no, then take Spirit of Salt, and
Salt of Urine, mix them together in such a quantity, that you can perceive no
taste of either, but another or middle taste betwixt both, then coagulate it,
and force it to ascend, and you will have just such a Salt-Armoniack as is
commonly sold; whence you see plainly, that common Salt-Armoniack is nothing
else but a double and satiated Spirit, or rather a Spiritual Salt; and being
of such a double nature, it has the precedence before all common and known
Spirits, and Corrosives, and so opens Metals and Minerals, as no other Salt
can do the like, whereof I will give you a clear Demonstration at the end of
this Chapter, viz. of its great power to manifest that which is occult: and
therefore Basilius Valentinus says well of the same; The Salt-Armoniack is not
the meanest key to unlock Metals; and therefore is compared by the Ancients
unto a flying Fowl; it is able with its swift Feathers to carry on high the
Tincture and color of Minerals, and some of Metals, and you will find it of
force sufficient to prepare, and fit Metals for Transmutation; for without
preparation no Metal can be transmuted, etc. Note this Doctrine of Basilius,
for I have set it down not without cause. Now although by this my demonstration
you will be convinced, that the name of a double and satiated Spirit is not
undeservedly given unto the Salt-Armoniack, and that this term is not newly
invented by me, but according to its real being has been in the
Salt-Armoniack, although the name was not usual hitherto: yet you may further
object, if Salt-Armoniack be such a double and satiated Spirit, why is it not
sufficient of it self to reduce the Copper into a Volatile Spirit, but there
must be made another double Spirit of the Salt-Armoniack, and the Alcali? For
answer know, that the Spirit, or rather Salt of Urine, whereof the
Salt-Armoniack consists, is the only cause of it, for it always retains the
nature of Salt, and cannot be reduced into a true Spirit: hence it raises the
Spirit of Salt, Vitriol, and other Corrosives (which are true Spirits) not in
the Form of a Spirit, but according to its own nature like a Salt, yea by its
Saltie nature turns them also into Salt, or into the shape of Salt, so long
as it is united with them: But now our Philosopher, as also Paracelsus, and
others before him require, that the Copper shall come over, not like a Volatile
green Salt, but like a very Volatile green Spirit, as our Philosopher says de
Lithiasi, Cap. 8. 21. that it must be Cupri liquamen Volatile; and in his
Duumviratus he says, that the Spiritus Viridis ought to be insigniter
volatilis, to the end that the body of the Copper may be rightly prepared and
fitted, that it may yield its tincture afterward; and therefore it must be so
forcibly torn assunder, and reduced into the smallest atoms, viz. into a
subtle spirit; for without this proceeding, its anima cannot be got, as he
says expressly, loco jam citato d^ Lithiasi 5. Non potest autem haberi ignis
Veneris, nisi cum plenaria (NB) Cupri destructione corporisque mercurialis
ipsius Veneris Volatilisatione: but the Salt Armoniack, though it be a double
and satiated spiritual salt, cannot perform this, although the vulgar
Vitriolum Veneris or Cuprum limatum or ustum, be never so often and so many
times elevated therewith, because it is but a dry salt, but not a penetrating
and attenuating spirit, which is far more subtle and efficacious to unlock,
penetrate, and spiritualize than salt, though it be never so volatile. Now
although the Salt Armoniack be not such a double spiritual substance, as to
have power to do the Philosophers work, and to reduce Copper into a subtle
penetrating, Volatile Spirit, yet the nature and substance of the Salt
Armoniack, as being really a double spiritual salt, has given occasion unto
the Philosophers, though after another manner, yet from the same ground,
whereof the Salt Armoniack consists, to find out, and to prepare another sort
of satiated and double substance, which always is and remains a very
Volatile and flying Spirit. For they considered thoroughly the parts, whereof
the Salt Armoniack, as being a double substance, does consist: and they found,
that (as I demonstrated above at large) it consists of a fiery and of a
corrosive substance; but seeing that the fiery substance in its nature is no
true spirit, and consequently not serving their turn, viz. to reduce Copper
into a volatile Spirit; therefore instead thereof they chose such a fiery salt,
as being distilled is a true spirit, and never ascends in the form of Salt,
much less changes the adjoined corrosive into the form of a dry salt, as the
salt of Urine does To find out the same they considered the property and
efficacy of the salt of Urine, viz. that its nature is, to mortify or satiate
all corrosives, by which virtue it does precipitate metals dissolved in a
corrosive, eagerly falling upon the corrosive, satiating it self therewith, and
so freeing the corroded metal from it; and because they found that the same
power, yea more effectual, resideth in the fiery fixed Alcalies, they judged
them fit for the purpose, that as in the preparation of Salt Armoniack the
fieriness of the Salt of urine does satiate the corrosive, so as to their
purpose the Alcalies lay hold of the corrosive, and that of them both there
should arise a tertium, duplicatum, satiatum sal: and consequently by
distillation such a double spirit; they also first distilled the Alcalia by a
very strong fire, according to art, and found that they ascended not like a
volatile Salt, but like a true, very subtle and penetrating spirit (of mighty
great power and virtue in Physic) and therefore they mixed the Salt Armoniack
with the Alcalies, and the corrosive having more inclination to them, than to
the fiery salt of Urine, presently associated it self with the Alcali, leaving
the salt of Urine, and so making a new double satiated salt, tasting neither of
the Alcali nor of the corrosive, but as a mixture of both, as experience does
testify to this day. Now because both the corrosive and the Alcali being forced
over by fire, turn into a true spirit, it must of necessity follow, that of
this double salt no other but a true satiated and double spirit must come; and
experience it self confirms it, that a very volatile spirit comes thence;
having such a property as no other corrosive has, which fall upon the
Metallic bodies with great fury and ebullition, corroding them, and adheering
outwardly unto them, seek to get their habitation therein: but in regard that
this double spirit is already satiated in himself, and is of a double and
mighty force, therefore it opens the metallic bodies in a clean other way
than the common corrosives do; for by virtue of its double and volatile nature
it pierces and penetrateth to the very inmost center of every atome of the
Metals, and turns outward all power, color, tincture and virtue; yea
quickneth them, and makes them active, which before lay hidden and dead as it
were. Now upon this elucidation you may say, since in the Salt Armoniack there
is no other corrosive, but the Spirit of Salt, whether it be not all one, to
make first the spirit of Salt, and to join it with the Alcalies, and in this
manner to get a double volatile spirit? For Answer whereunto, know that the
Philosophers had reason, yea were constrained to make use of the Salt
Armoniack, because that its corrosive (though as to its first rise proceeding
from Salt) by reason of its union undergone with the fiery Salt of Urine (where
they did act into one another, and change one another in their nature) has got
another, and far more excellent nature than it had before; and hence the
Philosophers were necessitated to acquiesce in the Salt Armoniack and thence
got their corrosive. And I must confess, that after I had learned to
understand and know the ground and root of the Salt Armoniack, I thought my
self also that the Spirit of Salt might be used for this intent: So I tried it,
but could get no such spirit, as I had from the Salt Armoniack, whence it was
apparent to me, why the Philosophers esteemed always so highly of the Salt
Armoniack: And therefore I desired to see and taste this corrosive naked and by
it self, and to try its virtue, whither alone and of it self, it would show it
self more excellent and powerful, than the common spirit of Salt, and I took
much pains about it, trying many deceitful processes, which promised the
obtaining of this corrosive, or sour spirit, amongst which the most fallacious
and perverse is that which teaches to mix Salt Armoniack with Wheaten flower,
and to distill it, and so to get this desired corrosive, the foolishness
whereof I have showed already in the former Chapter, and is therefore needless
to make any further mention of it. And because I could not attain thereunto by
the means of those big-speaking, or boasting process-books, and the like
writings, I searched for it diligently and earnestly, and with great care
pondered and observed the nature of things, until I found it; which in regard
of its Simplicity I might have found out long ago and very easily, if I had but
stuck to Nature and its Simplicity, and avoided the misguiding Writers, which
afford little truth, but much confusion and error. The ground for to obtain
this corrosive consists in this, that the fiery Salt of urine be first taken
away and severed, else it is impossible to get the sour spirit alone, for they
dwell in each other. This separation of the fiery Salt, though it may be done
by joining of an Alcali unto the Salt Armoniack, for straight by a gentle heat
it will totally be gone, but yet this serves not our business in hand, for
then it is again mixed and satiated with the Alcali; from which it cannot be
separated bare and single in its nature, but if it be forced according to art,
it forces the Alcali to come along, and so is not single in its Nature; the
reason is, because that the Alcali it self also is of a salty nature as well as
the corrosive, and therefore their union is so accurate, and their inclination
unto one another so great, that it is impossible to sever them, because of the
likeness or the sameness of their natures, being both of a salty nature, whence
their tie is not soluble: therefore in stead of the Alcalies other subjects
must be taken, such as are of no salty nature, and yet being kept in the fire
together with the Salt Armoniack have power to retain the corrosive, and to
dismiss the fiery Salt. There are diverse such subjects which will perform this,
yet still one better than the other; for one attracteth or holds fast more of
the corrosive than the other, and the best of all is the Lapis Haemathites, by
the means whereof this sour spirit is got best, and in most quantity, as the
Mechanica will teach you; for if you mix the Salt Armoniack very accurately
with the Boodstone, and distill it, presently, there comes a great deal of
the fiery urinous spirit, and so much as there is loosened of the same, so much
of the corrosive is tied unto the boodstone; and if at last you give a little
stronger fire, a part of the Salt Armoniack will ascend also in its unchanged
and former nature; but being of double virtue, it carries up along the
subtlest virtue and best flores of the boodstone, and thence is colored so
fair like an Orange, delightful to behold; which, after the distillation is
finished, make into fine powder and throw it in highly rectifyed spirit of
wine, and keep it till I teach you what further to do therewith: The fiery
Spirit that came over, you may use in all points, as they do other spirit of
Salt Armoniack of an urinous odor, for betwixt this and the other there is no
difference: but the corrosive or acid spirit you must seek in the Caput
Mortuum, into which this corrosive has so insinuated it self, and is so fast
locked up in it, that although you force this Caput Mortuum with never so strong
a fire, yet you cannot get this corrosive, yea not so much as one drop of it,
but if this Caput mortuum* be duly purified, the desired corrosive will come
easily to light, yea in Sand also: to attain unto this, beat the Caput Mortuum
into very fine powder, and throw it straight into good Spirit of Wine, which
will take into it self all the corrosive, and the subtlest parts of the
bloodstone, which the corrosive laid hold on, uniting it self therewith, and
you will see it presently tinged of a Gold-colour, which decant, and pour on
other, repeating this process until no spirit more be tinctured, then draw off
all the spirit in Balneo, and being all come over, you will find in the
Cucurbit a balsamic, aromatic Salt, for the most part smelling like Saffron,
which put into a luted glass Retort in a wind furnace, and distill with a gentle
fire, and presently the corrosive, which was in the Salt Armoniack, will come
over; continue this distillation with a gentle fire, till no drops more come,
then strengthen the fire by degrees, and there will come, very fair flores, as
light as down feathers, glistering and of various fair colors, as red, of gold
color, and many others very pleasant to behold; and take heed that you make
not too much have in the beginning, nor exceed with the Fire, for it will not
be done with violence, but requires time, for if you force it before the time,
all will be gone, and you will get nothing, and therefore I do give you fair
warning: The distillation being done, rince off with your corrosive all the
flores which are in the neck of the Retort, and pour them together with the
Corrosive, in a glass Retort, and abstract the Corrosive with a gentle fire,
and all the flores remain in the bottom, and the desired Acid Spirit of the
Salt Armoniack is in the Receiver clear and white, of excellent Virtues, and of
as much greater power in its operation beyond the common spirit of salt, as a
strong well grown Man in comparison of a Youth of eighteen years of age, as by
diligent enquiry you may know experimentally; and thence you will know, why the
Philosophers in preparing of their double Spirit kept to the Corrosive of the
Salt Armoniack, and preferred it before the spirit of salt. And although my
intent is not to speak of any thing else, but what serves to confirm my
elucidation, which hitherto has been done to the full, yet I cannot pass by,
because in the demonstration of the excellency of the Corrosive from the
Salt-Armoniack the abovesaid golden flores of the boodstone accompanied the
rest: to mention their great usefulness, to the end, that they as a Noble
Treasure may be employed for the benefit of the diseased. Take therefore, the
spirit of Wine, wherein you have thrown the sublimed Salt-Armoniack, mixed with
the Gold-like flores, decant it, and pour on other, repeating the same forth
and forth, till it be tinged no more: Abstract all the spirit of Wine in Balneo
(NB in Balneo, for in ashes or sand it will not come over, of which you may
consider further) and in the bottom of the Cucurbit, you will have a very fair
salt, of a very curious color, insomuch that the sight can hardly leave
looking upon it, and of a very strong Odor, like unto Saffran, which mix with
the other flores which in the rectification of the Corrosive spirit remained in
the Retort, mix them well together, and lay them in a Cellar for to dissolve,
and you will get a very fair Liquor far surpassing the choicest Gold in Color,
and take good heed, that when at last the drops begin to grow pale, that you
let them not come to the other, but keep them by themselves for fevers; but
the first keep by it self for a rare Medicine (especially being mixed with
Gum Armoniack, and made up in pills) in Hydrope, quartana, scorbuto,
plueritide, renum calculo, colica, obstructione mensium, Melancholia
Hypochondriaca, affectibus ventriculi variis, and many other grievous
infirmities; and it has also vim anodynam and somniferam, by reason of its
Gold and Saffran-like Tincture, and Aromatical smell. Whence you may perceive
the great power which the Salt-Armoniack has in opening and inverting of
Metals; for who should have thought, that such an excellent Balsamic smell
should be hidden in such a hard harsh and gross body as the boodstone is, if
the Salt Armoniack had not discovered it unto us. Therefore seek and you will
find, to the end that the hidden virtues of Nature may be manifested, and
thence much praise may redound unto the most holy Creator of these virtues.

CAP. VI.
How the sweet Vitriol of Copper is to be distilled into a green Spirit.
THe Philosophers Writings manifesting, that of Vitriol and Copper there may be
made a green spirit, of very great virtues, there were always found seekers of
truth, who took very great pains to obtain this Noble green Spirit, and to
delight themselves in its power and Virtue; but when they saw that Vitriol,
however distilled, will not yield such a green Spirit as the Philosophers
Writings do promise, they thought that the old Wise Men would not be understood
of Common distillation, but conjectured that by some sundry subtle way, or by
sundry unknown sleights such greenness is to be obtained; and therefore they
begun to invent all sorts of ways, how to attain unto their purpose. And first
there were some which that they might obtain a greenness, took the subtlest
Spirit of Vitriol, and distilled it from some Vegetables, so many times, and so
often, until by manifold Cohobation it carried along over the greenness of the
herbs, and so pleased themselves with a greenness borrowed from Vegetables, so
setting their heart at rest, which had as much efficacy, as the Virtue of the
adjoined herbs did extend it self. Others when they saw, that the greenness of
the Vitriol will not ascend, inverted it, and forced it downwards, and so with
great shouting they conceived to have caught the truth of the business,
whereas in that manner part of the Vitriol falls through with it, whereof the
Liquor must needs turn green; for the vehement vomiting, which such a pretended
green Spirit causes, sufficiently does show, that the gross corporal Vitriol
is in it, in regard that it is, and remains always the quality of Vitriol to
cause much vomiting. Others followed the former, who acknowledging this way of
forcing per descensum too gross, invented somewhat, that has some color of a
sundry, so termed Philosophical distillation, and of a sundry secret
Philosophical Vitriol, which is not common; pretending that the Philosophers
have not used common Vitriol, nor Copper for this purpose, but used their own
proper, hitherto unknown, Vitriol, which they made of the seed of all Metals,
and that this seed is a sort of round stones found in the fattest beds, which
as it is a sundry matter of a secret Vitriol, so likewise that it must be
distilled after a secret and no known way, but that after this seed is
impregnated by the Air with sufficient moisture, so that it can Liquefie in
water, they purified that green Metallic juice which came thence from its
Corporeousness by filtration, and they interpreted filtration to be the
Philosophers distillation, and so they did not only violence to the word
Distillation, forcing it to be the same with filtration, but also vented their
feigned first matter, or semen metallorum (which yet by its right name is
called Pyrites, and indeed shows it self to be such) for to be the Matrix of
the Philosophers Vitriol, whereas experience witnesses, that such a pretended
Philosophical Vitriol has not the nature and quality which the true Vitriol of
the wise has, viz. that it is sweet, and procures rest, as a true domicilium
very anodyni Philosophorum; but the pretended Philosophers Vitriol, is as
gross violent, bitter and nauseous, as common Vitriol, and indeed is none
other but common Vitriol, in regard that it has the same rise with the common,
viz. from the fire-stone. And as this pretended Vitr. Phil. is false, so is
also their Distillation, viz. Filtration, merely a feigned pretense, and
presumptious perversion of the words of the wise: And this perverted
Philosophical distillation (else called Filtration) yields a much more vehement
greenness than that per descensum, in which not all the Vitriol falls
through, but only some small quantity; but in the perverted Philosophical
Distillation all runs through the Filter, and yet they vent it, for such a
curious and special Philosophical green spirit.

There were others, and those best of all, which remained in the genuine
literal sense of Distillation, and there they sought for it, and in regard they
could get no such greenness from the Vitriol by no manner of way, they
conjectured that the Philosophers added something unto Vitriol, which they had
concealed from us, and therefore out of two several Retorts they forced the
Vitriol and Saltpeter by quick and ready sleights into one Receiver, where
these two Spirits working into one another, there arose a green Liquor or
Spirit, as to the color, and herein they did acquiesce, and truly this last
way is yet best of all; not in regard of its assumed greenness (which is but a
Reflection as it were, risen from the action of the two Spirits, and so only an
outward painting) but because of the union or copulation of these two spirits,
whence one spirit arises of a very subtle, penetrating, and attenuating
Virtue, whereby it is of a quick operation, and is not to be despised in
Epilepsia, but meriteth commendation: and you need not suspect (as I did in my
first ignorance, and therefore abhorred the use of it) that this Spirit is an
Aquafort, because that Aquafort is likewise made of Vitriol and Saltpeter, by
no means; for the case is clean other with the Aquafort in regard that not so
much as the least part of the virtue of Vitriol can come into the Aquafort,
because that all its virtue and acidity as soon as the Saltpeter joyneth
thereunto and grows hot with it, is fettered and tied as it were by the
Niter, by reason of the special love betwixt them both, whereof much might be
said and plainly demonstrated, which for brevities sake is now passed by;
insomuch that it is impossible that any part of the Vitriol can come over, its
nature being altered instantly, so soon as the Niter grows hot with it: but
because this shining green very Volatile spirit consists of the true essential
parts and Spirits of Vitriol and Niter, therefore it is clean of another Nature
then Aquafort, which is but a single acid Spirit of the Saltpeter, and
therefore not to be abhorred, which I counted very fit to be mentioned,
reserving the rest for another time; and waving also other more sorts of
conceited greenness, got by Distillation, to avoid Prolixity.

The rise of these and all other errors is only thence, that the ground of the
double or satiated Spirits was unknown unto the Seekers of truth, without which
Spirits the Copper never can come over and turn to a liquamen volatile, which
ground if it had been known, the true green spirit would have been discovered
long ago, which I clearly enough have expounded in the two former Chapters. Now
this double corrosive, having reduced the Copper into a green sweet Vitriol,
does not adhere outwardly thereunto, as the other corrosives, for this is the
only reason why the others cannot carry over the Copper; because they do not
reach to the inmost center of the Copper; but only, as hungry corroding
spirits, fall outwardly upon the Metal, and do but adhere unto it, hence it
comes to pass, that being forced by a strong fire, they are constrained to
relinquish their habitation, and the Copper remains behind of the same
condition as before, in regard that it may be quickly melted again into a body.
But the Double corrosive, as has been often mentioned, does not corrode the
Metal, nor falls upon it with such an hungry fury, much less adhereth
outwardly unto it, but softeneth it thoroughly, and penetrateth to its very
inmost, yea uniteth it self so firmly and so deeply with the Copper, that it
cannot leave it, being forced by the fire; but in regard that it is a corrosive
Volatile Spirit, the Copper must also come over with it, as a flying Volatile
Spirit, in so much that not one grain of the Metal remains behind; for if you
put some of it in a Crucible, and let it stand in a strong fire for some
hours, the Metal will quite evaporate that not the least Vestigium of Vitriol
remains to be seen; but in a close Vessel or Retort it cannot be done with
such ease and expedition as in an open melting pot: For the case is otherwise,
and there is required a far stronger fire, and many Cohobations, as our
Philosopher says, loco citato, per repetitas cohobationes insigniter volatilis
factus Spiritus, before all will come over, which will cost time, labor, and
patience, and there must be no haste, but all must be done with discretion,
without violence; and great care and consideration must be had of the nature of
things, how they will be used, that you do them right, and according to Nature;
which you must learn from experience and from the nature of those things which
you have in hand; for here all information cease, which one man can impart
unto another, here we must go into the School of nature, and sharpen our
judgment and understanding for to penetrate the subjects in hand, but above
all, by prayers made in a child-like simplicity and humbleness, obtain the
blessing of a good success from our God and Father.

Now as I have mentioned of Copper, the case is the same with Gold, which being
put into its double and satiated corrosive melts therein, without ebullition,
like ice in warm water; And because this corrosive softeneth the Gold to its
very inmost parts, it also comes over with it readily by manifold cohobations,
with very fair colors, for the tinging spirit or anima of the Gold, is very
much exalted in its tincture and color by this mighty corrosive, insomuch that
it comes over in a far more glorious splendor, than the best gold looks of
its nature, and it is very like unto the splendor and beauty of the Sun rising
over the Horizon, which is no small delight to the eyes to behold: however both
it and the Copper may easily be reduced again into a body, and therefore it is
but a preparation or fitting of the Gold and Copper, that they may be made fit
to yield afterward their strength and blood-red juice unto the artificial hand
of the Philosopher, as we shall now further understand.

CHAP. VII.
How the double Corrosive is to be separated from the volatilized Copper.
ALthough the Copper, as even now mentioned, is come over in form of a Volatile
green Spirit, let none therefore conceive that Copper, because reduced to such
a Spiritualnesse, is so far unlockt and opened, that it must always remain
such a spiritual Substance, and that it cannot be separated from its adjoined
Corrosive, by no means: for although the whole Crew of all common Chemical
Authors in their Books do unanimously teach (yea rejoice highly in it, though
indiscreetly) that when they forced over a Metal with corrosive, or acid
Liquors, by means of many cohobations, they count the same to be the true
quinta essentia of the Metal, or the verum potabile Metallum, and therefore
also highly boast, and glory, thereof, and so hitherto seduced one another, and
by sweet words persuaded the Auditors or Readers to applaud it: of which sort
of processes I could set down a great number, which might be taken out of their
Books, if I did not spare the precious time and Paper; yea our Philosopher
himself (in those years of his Tyrocinium) lay sick of this disease of
Ignorance; conceiving, when by means of certain corrosives and manifold
cohobation he fetched over the gold in forma punicei olei volatilis, that he had
the true aurum potabile: But the matter is clean otherwise; for there is a
twofold Solution of Metals: the one Friendly and Natural; the other, violent;
the former is fundamental and radical, and the solvent and the solutum can
never be more severed asunder, but by reason of the great similitude of both
their natures, they twane come to be one, and remain also unchangeably and
unseparably one: but in this viz. in the violent solution it is not so, but
although it has some semblance of a radical solution, yet the event does show
that there is such a difference betwixt this and the other and that they are as
unlike unto one another, as the substance it self, and the shadow of the
substance, in regard that in this the solvent may be thoroughly separated from
the solutum by Art, and the solutum being melted by a strong fire, will return
to be what it was, before it suffered that violent solution; but in the other,
viz. in the natural solution, not only the solvent can never be separated from
the solutum, but also the solutum in this solution becomes always more
precious, more noble, more excellent and far higher in its virtue, than it was
before; but in the violent solution the solutum remains in its former Nature
and substance, and is only fitted for the true essential, natural, and Radical
or fundamental solution. And because this is a highly necessary nodus
enodandus, in regard that almost all Tyrones Chymiatriae are seduced and
shamefully deceived in this, that they count violent solutions for to be
natural, and so delight themselves, and acquiesce therein, thinking then to
have already apprehended the truth of the matter, and taking no further care to
inquire after the sincere and genuine condition of the true natural solution,
therefore I must lay down the business clearly and nakedly, to the end that the
desirous seekers of truth may be no more gulled by the deceitful, seducing,
lying and painted Processes, wherewith all common Chemical books are filled up,
and abound, and by the searchers of Nature with great expenses are tried in
vain, but that they may open their eyes themselves, and begin to see with their
own eyes, and rightly ponder and examine the Nature of things they are about,
and so work according to the whole nature, and not credit so lightly hereafter
those sweet lying promises of boasting Authors, nor spend their precious time,
hard labor, and great cost upon them. To the end therefore, that the
truth-desirous Reader may so much the better comprehend and acknowledge this
highly necessary ground, I will lay it down unto him, by comparing two sorts of
solutions, such as are of a quite different nature: and first let him consider
the solution of the Copper by the double or satiated spirit, whereof I have
taught in the former Chapter, where not only the Metal, viz. Copper, is
dissolved softly, gently, sweetly, without any ebullition in its double
Menstruum, but also afterward so intimately adhered thereunto, that it went
over together with it in form of a very Volatile spirit, which may seem
therefore unto the ignorant to be a natural, and for the future, inseparable
solution, in regard that it is done friendly, and proves inseparable from its
solvent; for that the solutum according to outward appearance, by reason of a
singular harmony and likeness betwixt them, accompanies its solvent on high;
and I must confess, that this is such a nice matter, as that it may fool not
only Tyrones, but also those who conceit to have experienced and tried a great
deal, into a belief, that this so spiritual and Volatile Metallic vapor is the
true quinta essentia, whereas experience shows to the contrary, that if this
pretended quinta essentia Metallica be thrown upon Mercury, all that is
Metallic separateth it self from the solvent, and being put into a melting
fire, turns again to such a Metal as it was before. Whence the Reader plainly
sees, that it was but a semblance of an essential or radical solution, and
that not the least change or exaltation happened unto the Metal, unless that by
an artificial hand it be preserved in its solubility, so that it return not to
its former compactness, as hereafter shall be taught. Now on the other side,
let the seeker of truth look upon Sulphur, how the same being unlockt in
distilled Oil does turn outward its inmost red Tincture, and so is opened to
the very Center and inmost root, and then how firmly those two not only cleave
together, insomuch that they both turn to be one, but also never, no not by any
manner of way, can again be parted asunder; yea this is not all, but the
Sulphur becomes ten times more precious, excellenter, and more powerful in
its virtues, than it was before, all which you may experiment thus; Take common
Sulphur, or else the Combustible Sulphur of Antimony, or of any other subject,
and dissolve it in a distilled Oil, so that the Oil turns very thick or
blood-red, put this solution into a Retort, and draw the Oil over very gently,
and it will come over clear and white; and when none more will come over clear,
then increase the fire strongly, and at length comes the last Oil, and
carries along part of the dissolved Sulphur like a red Oil; then pour the
first clear Oil, that came over first, aagain upon the remaining dark* brown
substance, Cohobating the same from it again, and repeating the same so often,
until most of all your extract be come over, and all your Oil be distilled
over very red and rich of the Tincture; and your solvent and solutum will be so
united, that by no art they are to be parted asunder; they by reason of the
likeness of their substance so delighting in each other, and so intimately
being united together, that they both are come to be one substance, and so
either both flee together away, being driven by the force of fire, or else by
discreet ways may be fixed together into a permanent substance: yea, not only
are they impartible, but also the dissolved and volatilized Sulphur, is of far
greater power and efficacy in Physic, than before, as daily experience may
teach every one: and although this solution of Sulphur in oil be not properly a
Philosophical solution but only the ground and right source of the same, yet it
is sufficiently demonstrative, and therein as in a true pourtraicture, the
essential, radical and natural solution of the Wise may be represented and
compared with the other violent Solution, to the end that by comparing together
these two different solutions, the truth of the business may be made manifest,
viz. that although the forementioned solution of the Copper resembles much to
a radical solution of the metal, as agreeing with the natural and true solution
in these two points, that the solution of the metal is done gently, sweetly,
and without ebullition; and then that the Metal readily ascends on high with
its Solvent, and so seemed to be turned into one spirit, and one indivisible
substance therewith; yet because the Metal can be severed again from its
solvent, it is evident that this volatilisation of the Copper is but a violent
elevation, and not a spontaneous concomitance, arisen from the likeness of
nature, as it happened with the Sulphur and Oil, and as it is the condition of
all true solutions, having their rise from similitude of nature. And therefore
not only the now mentioned Solution and Volatile green spirit of the Copper, but
also and much more the Putatitious Oils, Spiritus or Essentiae Metallicae of
your common Chemical Writers (viz. Hartman, Penotus, Crollius, Libavius,
Agricola, Beguin, Rhenanus, Faber Monspeliensis, Glauber, Kesler, and many
others of the like stamp, whose books are in the hands of every one) are
nothing else, but (as our Philosopher calls his formers fooleries in Gold in
progymnasmate meteori. 6.) mentitus liquor, a deceitful essence, which has a
resemblence of the essential solution, but in effect is nothing less than
such, in regard that it can readily return again to what it was before, and a
seeker of truth darkneth himself not a little, by doting upon such specious
and deceitful essences, and remaining thereby; For here we must not stay and
acquiesce, in that the Copper is reduced to a spiritual condition and
Volatility, but here we must but now truly begin, and endeavor (in regard that
it is evident by this my deduction, that the Copper is not essentially or
according to nature unlockt as yet, but only fitted for further solution) how
to get the true Anima thence, by a true radical and natural solution:
Therefore, knowing, that most men are blind in this point, sticking in those
putatitious Metallic essences, I counted it necessary, in imparting the
Doctrine of Volatilisation of the Copper, to admonish, that such and the like
solutions of Metals ought not to be valued higher than they are, and that none
deceive himself, thinking that he has a treasure of health, whereas it is but
a shadow: and such a putatitious Essentia metallica may be reduced again by an
artificial hand in a short time, yea in few hours, to such a gross Metal, as
it was before, as the experienced Chymiater, and diligent searcher of Nature
Zwelfferus does confess in his Writings, that the hitherto known Tinctures,
Essences, etc. of Metals, are nothing else but solutions of Metallic bodies,
but not at all true separations of the Tincture or soul from the body.

However it being very necessary, that the same be effected, if we mean to
enjoy the Metallic Arcana, and next the blessing of God rely upon them in
grievous diseases; And therefore going on further, and enquiring how to get and
separate the pure Tincture (which is the only thing we aim at) from the fitted
and prepared Copper, We find, that our Volatile Copper is surrounded with a
great quantity of the double corrosive, which of necessity must be severed from
it first, if we intend to get the pure Anima without heterogeneous mixture;
especially the corrosive having already acted its part as much as it could do,
viz. rent the Copper into the most subtle volatile parts, and reduced it to the
smallest dust; Now the separation thereof from the Copper, must not be done by
the means of Mercury, or the like Volatile things, which having a greater
affinity with, or inclination to this double corrosive than the Copper has, do
quickly unite therewith, and being also Volatile, by one only distillation, do
rent this double corrosive per force from the Copper, and so leave the Copper
in the bottom as a gross dead powder, which is hardened again and fit for
nothing; by no means, for so all your Labor which you bestowed upon the
Volatilisation would be lost, and such a dead powder would not differ from
another common Crocus Veneris, made by common Aquafort, or aqua Regis; for in
regard that the double corrosive has not only quite turned the inside of the
Copper outward, and so perfectly fitted it for extraction, but also the sweet
Anima of the Copper by this corrosive and its power, as by a resuscitative and
quickening means, does shine forth; and without such a pertinent means this
Tincture could not play forth; therefore this corrosive must be severed and
abstracted from the Copper very leasurely and imperceptibly as it were, to the
end that the Copper may remain turned outward with its sweetness, and
unchanged in its forthshining quality, and posture of solubility, wherein it
cannot be preserved, if so be that this corrosive, whereby the Copper is as it
were raised from death, be abstracted from it per force, and at once, by
Mercury or the like; for in this manner each atom of the Copper would be as
hard compacted, and locked up again as before, its resuscitating corrosive being
taken thence by force, and at once; But there must be used other more
properthings, such as 1. may carry the corrosive thence, not at once, and by
violence, but by degrees, gently and sweetly; 2. which do not precipitate the
Copper, and sever it from its double corrosive, but prove a solvent both of the
Copper, and of the double corrosive; and so, notwithstanding that in every
cohobation some of the double corrosive goes along, yet preserve the Copper in
its former nature, viz. in its solubility, and in this manner the Copper, and
all its atoms are preserved in the same condition; which only and alone is
performed by the spirit of wine, as our Philosopher teaches us, in express
words, Sal Armoniacus inde post modum auferri debet per spiritus vini repetitas
distillationes, in Duumviratu,. 9* Therefore you must take highly rectifyed
spirit of Wine, and mix it with the green spirit of Copper, and abstract it
gently, and then pour it on again, and then abstract it again, and such
cohobation you must oftentimes repeat, doing it very gently, and the corrosive
as a very Volatile spirit will come over by degrees with the spirit of Wine, as
with the like volatile substance, and let fall of it self by degrees the Copper
which it contained, as you will see, that in each cohobation some of the Metal
will be found in the bottom in form of a very light spongious dust, and in
case you miss, as it happened unto my self sometimes, that the distillation
should be too forcible, and the fire too strong, there chances sometime some
of the Metal to come over of such wonderful fair colors, that it cannot be
beheld sufficiently, and such curious colors remain in the head, representing
the most beautiful Peacocks tail, unless the double corrosive be distilled
through this head, for then all will melt again into it; but that which by the
violent distillation is come over of the Copper, falls afterward also to the
bottom in the Receiver as light as down Feathers, and has the same color, as
those atomi have, which precipitated in the Cucurbit, to which also they are to
be added. It is also further here to be known, that the double corrosive not
only therefore lets fall its Metal, the Copper, because that it comes over
gently with the Spirit of Wine, but also for this reason, because the great
sharpness and edge of the corrosive is blunted and abated by the Spirit of
Wine, insomuch that it is not able to hold the Metal any longer, because it
has lost its strength or corrosivenesse; whereof you may be convinced by this
experiment, that if you mix this green spirit, with a sufficient quantity of
Spirit of Wine, and set it together in continued digestion for a competent time
(viz. for a great space of time of many months) the Metal will also
precipitate slowly and by degrees, in form of a very spongious light dust: But
this being too tedious, the more expedite way is by cohobation; for then you
will far sooner attain to its period. Now these cohobations being continued to
sufficiency, and performed as they ought, and all the corrosive being got over,
you have then the true Crocus Veneris, Martis, Auri, etc. according to the
Metal which you have taken of far higher and nobler Virtues, than all the
Croci of the common Writers; and however they be prepared, yet they cannot be
compared unto these; for their Croci are dead bodies, but here is a
resuscitated and quickened body, its soul being quite turned outward, and in
its full luster, which you may perceive by the glorious splendor, which this
Crocus with its choicest colors leaves in the head, if peradventure it be
driven over by too strong a heat: Now by this light turned outward, this
Crocus has so great virtue, as well for inward Medicine, as externally to be
used in plasters, salves, and other sorts of exterior Medicaments, as hardly
can be believed, before it be experimented; And therefore also I will referr it
to the experience of the diligent searcher of truth, who will find far more
Virtue in it than he is able to conceive at present; But to clear this I cannot
forbear to mention, why the ancient wise Authors of the highly noble Chymia,
called these resuscitated and revificated atoms of Metallic bodies Crocus,
which signifies Saffran? Now he that has but a little Enquired into the
Virtues of this Crocus revificatus by experience will quickly know the reason,
viz. because this Crocus Metallicus does perfectly possess those Excellent
Virtues of Saffron, which is the King of all Vegetables, and therefore called
the Philosophers aroma, or spice, as our Philosopher de Lithiasi cap. 7.. 14.
declares, adding that the Aroma Philosophorum, by reason of its Golden
Tincture, is the surest preservative against the Stone. For as Saffron, 1.
causes rest, 2. comfort the heart, 3. opens obstructions, 4. mollifieth
and ripeneth that which is hard and unripe, 5. heals all that which is
wounded, and preserves it from all Sympomes; So likewise, yea in a far higher
degree, and with far more Efficacy, this our Crocus Philosophicus causes rest,
and appeaseth pain, powerfully strengthens weak Nature, opens the most
dangerous obstructions of all the Viscera, yea stops all Fluxes, by virtue
of the shining Anima turned outward, and as well in Tumors, as Ulcers and
wounds, affords such quick help, as no Mineral Medicines of the common
Writers can parallel, as the Reader having tried it, will find by experience. I
can also not omit to relate the Eminent Virtues of the Spirit of Wine, which
carried over the double corrosive, and is united therewith: For in it is a
double power or virtue, first of the corrosive, which in its nature by reason
of its duplicity, and containing an Alcali Volatile, does far exceed all Acid
Liquors, and therefore also is of great virtue in the Stone; Secondly, because
of the splendor or radiation, which this double spirit receceived from the
Gold-like Anima of the Copper; for although not the least pulvisculus of this
Gold-like Tincture remained with this corrosive, yet having received its
radiation and kept it, which is as it were by a seal deeply imprinted therein,
and thence exalted in virtue beyond what it was before of it self. Therefore
let this spiritus vini esurinus be commended to you in all cases, in which you
use Acida and Esurina, and you will find with joy its great power in allaying
all manner of unnatural heat, beyond all known Acid Spirits: Also its great
Corrosiveness is much mitigated and abated by the Spirit of Wine, and so safer
for use than before; and being fast and intimately united with the spiritus
vini, it quickly uniteth, by the means thereof, with the Archeus, and
performs its operation with much expedition, because that the Virtue of the
spiritus vini is readily entertained, and so the power of this excellent Acetum
Esurinum penetrateth also with it, and gently cools, and refreshes the
incensed spirits.

CAP. VIII.
How to extract the pure Anima or Tincture from the true Crocus Veneris, and by
what means.
WHen your Copper is brought so far, that first by volatilisation it is
divided into the smallest Atoms, and by the Volatile double corrosive rent
asunder into impalpable dust, and then in a gentle way totally freed again from
all corrosive, then and not before it is fit to yield its tinging soul, and
heavenly virtue unto such a Menstruum, which is like unto its Anima in
substance, viz. which is of a like fiery Nature as the Tincture of the Copper
is; which is a mere fire, and therefore called by our Philosopher and other
Wise men, the Element of Fire; consequently cannot be extracted, severed, or
radically opened, but by a very Fiery, penetrating, vehement; and sharply
separating Volatile substance, which alone has the power, out of the hard
ligament of Metallic Coagulation (performed in the Copper by Nature) by a
strong Magnetic Virtue, eagerly to attract its like, and by its great
Fieriness to melt, soften, and open it to the very inmost ground, root, and
Center: such a Water or Menstruum it must be, as touches nothing at all of the
Body of the copper, nor desires to touch, much less to dissolve the least of
it, yea has no power at all to do so, but barely and only falls upon the
Anima or Sulphur of the Copper, as upon its like, and receives the same into
it self: such a liquor you must look for in the Fiery principle, as I
discovered above in the second Chapter, viz. in the nature of the Oil, which by
the strong power of the Fire being turned into fiery Salt, by Artificial
operation must be translated from the seat of a fixed Salt, into that of a
Volatile, penetrating, Fiery spirit. Now you may say, since this Menstruum is
such a Fiery substance, why can it not by its strong power as well extract the
Anima out of a common Crocus Veneris, Auri, Martis, etc. as out of that which
has been made Volatile, whereby much labor, expense and time might be saved in
preparing of this Arcanum? For answer know, that therefore it cannot be,
because that the Sulphur is too fast tied to the Corpus by the hard Metallic
Coagulation, and afterward by the melting Fire (when the Metal was melted into
a Corpus) totally turned inwards, and locked up into death, insomuch that though
the Metal be ground and powdered never so small, yet this Fiery Menstruum
cannot lay hold of its like, because it is not turned outward again, nor freed
from its hard Coagulation, and reduced into a Spongious, porous, light,
substance; which two properties are of necessity required in a Crocus
Metallicus, that this Fiery Menstruum may have ingresse to take the Element of
Fire from the Atoms of the Crocus into it self, and essentially to unlock it.

Now these two properties, viz. the Extraversion of the Anima, and then the
Spongiousness (in which two only consists the fitting of the Metals) both are
obtained by Volatilisation, which is to be done by no other means, but double
Spirits, and therefore the Philosophers kept this way of fitting or preparing
the Copper as secret, as the extraction or separation of the Tincture from the
Body; because they knew, that the one without the other will be of little use,
viz. that the Volatilised Alcali without the Volatilised Crocus will avail
little; on the other side the Crocus without an Alcali Volatile will not yield
its pearl, so both operations remained buried in the like silence. But that
you may the better understand this, and clearly see and acknowledge the same,
as in a printed Image standing before you, viz. how highly necessary, not only
the Spongious lightness, but also the Volatility is for extraction of Mineral
and Metallic Tinctures, and that you may be convinced, that without such a
preparation the Anima cannot be had nor obtained, I will set the same before
you in Antimony, as in a clear looking glass: Take therefore instead of the now
mentioned fiery water or Alcali Volatile, a very Fiery distilled Oil, and
instead of the Volatile Crocus Veneris, place Antimony, grind the same very
small, yea by much grinding reduce it into an impalpable dust: this impalpable
dust of Antimony put into a Phiol, pour upon it the most Fiery distilled Oil
that you are able to get, let it boil for many days together, and you will
see, that the Oil will remain without change as it was before, and the Antimony
will also remain perfectly in its former nature; Lo now, although you had never
so Fiery an Oil, and although in the smallest ground Antimony truly lies some
fiery thing, which has great affinity with the fiery Oil, and may be extracted
thence, yet the Oil was not able at this time to perform it, although it
touched every least Pulvisculus of the Antimony; But why so? Truly therefore
only, because that Antimony by nature being stated in a hard Mineral
Coagulation, the Oil has no power, though it be never so fiery, to untye this
hard Ligament of Coagulation, and to sever its like from thence, unless the
Antimony be first prepared, and become first Volatile, then also Spongious,
light, and swelled up, that is, that each Atome of the Antimony do swell big
and grow Spongious, and the Tincture, or Principium Elementi ignis, be
manifested therein, and turned outward; Take therefore your Antimony, and by a
very strong fire force it on high, and of a heavy compact Body you will get
very light and Spongious Atoms, which will readily yield their Anima or
Elementum ignis unto a Fiery Oil, for if upon these light Volatile Atoms of
Antimony, in a Phiol, you pour a Fiery Oil, and boil it together for a few
hours, then the Fiery Oil will apprehend its like, viz, the Fiery principium in
Antimony, attracteth and radically dissolveth the same, and tingeth it self
blood-red of the same, which before it could not do, when the Antimony was not
prepared as yet: so the case is the same in this our operation in Copper, that
although our Alcali Volatile be very Fiery, penetrating and powerful in
mollifying, melting and opening to the inmost Center all what in the Copper is
of affinity with its Fiery nature, yet it cannot prevail with it at all, nor
extract the least for all its great Fieriness, unless the Copper be first
inverted, and the interior extraverted, the Corpus loosened by Volatilisation
from its hard Coagulation, and so rent into the smallest atoms, and turned
into a very light, Spongious substauce, then and not before has the Fiery
Water of the Alcali Volatile power to abstract its like, viz. the Elementum
ignis from the Copper, and radically to unlock it.

Take therefore your Volatile Crocus, whither of gold, copper, steel, or any
other Metallic Body, put it in a Phiol, and pour the Volatilised Alcali upon
it (of the preparation whereof I will inform you by and by) shut the Phiol
close, and let it boil gently together in sand, about the space of six or
eight hours, and this Volatile Fiery Spirit, will extract its like, viz. the
Elementum ignis from the Crocus, and receive the same into it self by Sympathy,
and dissolve it radically by its greatly penetrating power; Now when you see,
that this Fiery Water is well Saturated and thickened with the Tincture of the
copper, then let it cool, and pour off what is dissolved, and pour on fresh
Spirit, and let this also dissolve as before, and so continue, until there be
nothing left in the Crocus for to extract, and the Fiery Menstruum can get no
more: then pour the Solutions all together, and abstract the Fiery spirit
gently, which you may use again for the like operation; and in the bottom of
the glass you will have the true Metallum potabile; if of Gold, aurum potabile;
of Copper, Cuprum potabile, and so forth of all other Metals. And such a Noble
Tincture is indeed and in truth a true potable Metallic essence, being mere
spirit, power and Light, and not reducible into a Metal alone, because it is
freed from all Corporeousnesse, and is all spirit, and virtue, as our
Philosopher says de Lithiasi cap. 8.. 5. Ignis sive Sulphur Veneris non
amplius reducitur in metallum per se, quia prout nullum Sulphur est Metallum,
ita omnis Mercurius Metallicus est verum metallum; And from this Tincture you
may confidently expect all those great Virtues, which in the Philosophers
Writings are attributed unto a true metallum potabile.

But about this solution you may observe, that when you have abstracted your
Fiery Menstruum, at last always some of it remains still with the extracted
Tincture, by reason of the likeness of their substance; for they act into one
another, insomuch that they lay hold of and retain one another, and so turn to
one substance, melting into one another: yea if this Menstruum should be boiled
a long time with this Tincture, it would totally remain with it, and turn
therewith into one fixed substance; for this solution is fermentalis, and
therefore each one transmuteth the other into its nature, and being both turned
into one substance, they can never any more be parted asunder. But let no Man
think, that because that part of this Menstruum remains with the solutum,
that therefore the case is the same here as it is with your Corrosive
Menstruum's, whose strongest part remains with the solutum, and the weaker
ascends; by no means, for that part which rises here first, is of the same
force and strength in its Fieriness, as that which comes over last; for in
this Fiery solvent there is no such imparity of parts as in the corrosives, but
this Fiery Menstruum is totally similar, and uniform in its substance, and
knows of no other division, but that either it remains totally with the
solutum in the bottom, like a fixed Salt, or else totally ascends therewith
like a volatile spirit, and therefore that which after the solution is drawn
over from the solutum, is not at all changed nor diminished from its former
strength, which it had before the solution. Also let no man wonder at it, that
here part of the solvent remains with the Solutum, for the Law of Uniformity
in substance does carry it, like eagerly laying hold of its like, and
unseparably uniting it self therewith.

And this is the chief property, whereby an Essential Natural Solution is
distinguished from a Corrosive one, that always the Corrosive by art can be
severed again from the Solutum, but the Essential solvent by no means! Hence
our Philosopher himself in this sense confesses, concerning the Liquor
Alcahest, that it is stayed or retained by its Compar, and transmuted into
another Nature; his words hereof in in ignota action Regiminis. 11. are these,
Liquor Alkahest omnia totius universi corpora tangibilia perfect reducit in
vitam eorundem primam, absque ulla sui mutatione, viriumque diminutione: a solo
autem suo compari subter jugum trahitur atque permutatur. Hence the ancient
wise men said, Natura natura gaudet, natura naturam vincit, permutat, etc. And
the whole Nature and all the powers thereof do testify the same, that like is
always inclined to stay with its like; yea in this very point consists all
the whole grows which happens in Nature, whereof I do not intend here to
speak more largely, but only I was occasioned to point at it by our natural
Solution of the anima of the Copper, which as a true fire retains the fiery
solvent, prepared of the Alcali, as its like, and is inclined to remain
inseparably united therewith. Now some may say, since the tincture of Copper,
or Element of fire is wholly turned outward in this Volatile and well prepared
Crocus, why may it not as well be extracted and severed by a fixed Alcali, as
by an Alcali volatile, for the other is also very fiery, and of a like nature
with the soul of the Copper, and why must the Alcali first be volatilised? for
a fixed Alcali might do it as well, and the work might be sooner ended, and
much time and expenses saved? I answer, that although a fixed Alcali makes a
show as if it would and could sever this fiery principium from the Copper, yet
in effect, and in truth it is not so, and that little which the fixed Alcali
severed from the Crocus Cupri is nothing to, be accounted of, in comparison of
what remains unseparated; the reason is the grossness of the Alcali, it being
too thick, corporeous and material, and not as it should be spiritual, volatile,
and penetrating; hence it is, that though you take an Alcali as fiery as that*
it burns the tongue, as much as a live or burning coal (it being possible to
get such a vehement burning Salt Acali from Mars, which in a moment touching
the tongue but very gently, burns the same, as if it were red hot iron) and
dissolve the same in some Water, and put therein your Volatile prepared Crocus
of Copper, and boil it soundly, thinking by this great fieriness to sever the
Element of Fire from the Crocus, yet for all that you get nothing, and all your
labor is lost, the fiery Alcali being much too gross and too weak to untie
this hard Metallic ligament. But if you mix that Alcali with the Crocus,
grinding both well together, and Endeavor the separation by fire in via sicca,
you will reach so far, that because by the External fire, the fieriness of the
Alcali is much fortifyed and becomes intenser than it was of its Nature, and
so the prepared Crocus is more opened and more fitted thereby for Extraction,
that in this manner the Alcali lays hold of some of the Tincture, and severeth
the same, but being wholly material, it reduces the Copper on the other side
by its gross fiery saltness again into a body, insomuch that you get again
material gross Copper, and so all your former tedious Labor is brought to
nothing. But that little which the Alcali lad hold on, though it be the true
Sulphur and Gold-like Tincture of the Copper, for this Alcali being rubbed upon
Silver with some Moisture, covers it over very fair with a Gold-colour, very
pleasant to look upon, but there is so little of it, that it is rather to be
counted but a shadow than substance of the Tincture: Moreover, though it were
faisible in this manner to sever all the Sulphur from the Crocus, yet it would
be barely separated, but not essentially dissolved, and become an opened oil or
juice, for to this pass it ought to be advanced, that part of the natural
solvent remain with the solutum, and by its fusile moisture this be reduced
into a juice or liquor, which the fiery Alcali is not able to do, in regard
that the same it self is no spiritual fusile oil or Spirit but a gross material
Salt, which very easily can be severed again from this small quantity of the
extracted Sulphur Cupri, if it be dissolved in water, and a corrosive dropped
thereinto; for then the Alcali uniteth with the corrosive, and lets the
extracted Sulphur fall to the bottom, which after exsiccation is a powder; but
what would become then of our Philosophers doctrine, who will have, that after
this Gold-like anima is severed from the body, it is to be coagulated and
fixed; but how can it be coagulated, if it be not first reduced to a Liquor by
an essential solvent, that is, so softened, that it remain an Oil, or fusile
penetrating spiritual substance, after its separation from the body, which is
the true mark or sign, that this Gold-like anima is essentially and naturally
unlockt, and untyed from its inmost center; such an excellency can the gross
material Alcali not afford, as may be seen by that small quantity of the
precipitated Sulphur, although the same also has its rare Virtues. Also let no
man fancy that such an Essential solution may be performed by the spirit of
Wine, that if one should take this Alcali after it has received that little
quantity of the anima Cupri, and grind it very small, and then pour upon it
highly rectifyed Spirit of wine, and set it to extract in a warm place, that
in this manner the extracted Tincture of the Copper should come into the Spirit
of Wine, and by means thereof, and from the same obtain an Essential moisture,
and be changed into a penetrating oil; No, you are out, the Spirit of Wine is
far too weak, being nothing but common Water for the most part, for a whole
pound of the strongest Spirit of Wine will not yield much above half an ounce
of Essential Salt, how then should such a far dispersed virtue be able
radically to mollify this concentred substance of the Copper, there is no
parity at all betwixt them both, but there is required a concentred spiritual
penetrating fire for this purpose, such as is all power, Spirit and Life, what
should such a watery Vapor be able to prevail, as the Spiritus vini is for the
most part. And although the Spiritus vini, standing upon such a tinged Alcali
in digestion; is changed in color and turns very red, yet it does not follow
therefore, that this Tincture is from the Copper, but is barely and only from
the Alcali, whereof it attracts, some subtle atoms, by which it is colored,
which you may be assured of by this experiment, viz. pouring spirit of Wine
upon such a bare fiery Alcali, which has not been used for extraction of the
Sulphur of Copper, and setting it in digestion, for then it will be as fairly
colored upon this, as upon the other, containing the few atoms Sulphuris
Cupri. Therefore it is very necessary, and unavoidable necessity requires it,
that (if you mean to obtain this uoble Tincture of the Gold-like soul of the
Copper) the fiery material Alcali be first made Spiritual, Volatile, penetrating
and active, which is not to be done, as most Readers do conjecture, that the
Alcali being a salt, is to be distilled and forced over as they do other salts,
mixing them (for to keep them from melting) with Earth, Lome, or the like, and
so forcing them over by the strong power of fire into a vapor and spirit; No,
such a sort of volatilisation does not serve our turn; for although the Alcali
in this manner may be forced over into a Volatile spirit, and the same also be
of very great virtue in Physic, yea far exceeds all other Medicamenta,
Diaphoretica, Incidentia, Resolventia, Deopilantia, Maturantia, Corroborantia,
which are to be found in any Apothecaries Shop, as every one that will prepare
and use it upon this my recommendation will find with admiration and great
profit to the sick, yet this serves not for the extraction and Essential
resolution of the Tincture of Copper, because it has been too much weakened in
the distillation, having left the most part of its natural fieriness with the
Earth or Clay, wherewith it is mixed for to fit it for distillation, its
fieriness having acted and consumed it self thereupon, and so lost its former
fiery power, in so much that by such a distillation there comes over a very
effectual spirit for Medicine, but very mild in taste, and far too weak for our
purpose: But here the Alcali must be raised so, as that it retain its fiery
mollifying Virtue, yea that it may become much more powerful and penetrating,
which is to be brought to pass by its like, viz. by an other like fiery
Alcali, but that this is to be Volatile, for if this were not Volatile, it could
not volatilize the other, for none can give more then he has himself, or
beyond what is in his power. Such a Volatile Alcali must first be got by art
from the same source, from which the fixed Alcali is risen, viz. from an Oily
Substance, for a true Alcali can come from no other, but from the Oily
Principium, and therefore you must hold to the oily ground, and endeavor to
turn the same into an Alcali Volatile. Now if you would do it by force of fire,
you would get no Volatile, but a fixed Alcali again; and therefore it must not
be done by such a violent way, but by a friendly one, such as is according to
nature, which way and unchangeable Law is this (as I mentioned before as much
as serves for our purpose) that like delights in its like, attracteth the
same, and uniteth the same with it self, and changes it into its own Nature.
Now if you will turn and change your Oily substance, according to this
immutable rule of Nature, into an Alcali, you must mix or unite the same with
nothing else but an Alcali, and keep them together for a sufficient time in a
gentle heat, and the fieryness of the Alcali will powerfully act into the
subtle attenuated Oily substance, which you joined thereunto, and transmute
the same, and because it is of the like Nature, property and substance (in
regard that the Alcali also rose from an Oil) therefore it changes the same
also by its strong fiery force into its nature, and turns the same from a
subtle spiritual, thin Oily substance into a fiery salty Alcali, and being
done gently, there is no violence offered to the Oily principium, as it
happens when the fire per force turns the Oil into an Alcali; therefore it
remains in its former Volatlity, insomuch that you have obtained an Alcali
volatile. But because these two are very intimately united and tied to each
other, therefore if you begin to force your Alcali volatile by the strength of
fire, the fixed Alcali must also rise with it, because of the similitude of
Substance, whereby they cleave to each other, and are inclined to abide with
each other: for as before by reason of the uniformity of substance the oily
spiritual substance was changed by the Alcali into its salty Alcalical nature,
from such a ground as is according to Nature: So now on the other side the
fixed Alcali, because of the great affinity betwixt them, accompanies the
Alcali volatile, and turns together with it into a Volatile penetrating,
concentred spirit, which is altogether power, Fire, Light, and Life, and in
this manner you obtain that which is necessary for this our purpose viz. for
the essential solution of metallic Sulphurs; whereof to speak any more would
be unnecessary and Superfluous, in regard that our faithful well deserving
Philosopher has described the same clearly and expressly in diverse places in
his Relict Writings; and the like has been done also by the sharp-sighted and
deeply Learned Raymund Lully, where the Reader will find it with all
circumstances: and therefore remain but with these two Authors, and do not seek
for it further from any other, and you will truly find so much iustruction in
them, as you shall need: unless that by the just judgment of God the eyes of
your understanding be blinded, because of your pride, covetousness and worldly
pleasures, for then you will truly not apprehend any thing of it, but they
would be sealed books and mere riddles to you. Now this spiritual fire and
softning essential Water separateth the pure Anima from the Metallic Body, and
dissolveth the same in such sort, that it is reduced, ad primam materiam,
softened to the inmost Center, and become a penetrating spiritual substance or
quinta essentia: But this spiritual fire has not only the efficacy just now
spoken off, but also barely of it self and alone, has such great virtues in
Physic, that its manifold and innumerable efficacies are highly to be admired
at; for it is ten times more powerful in operation, than the former Spirit,
which is forced by a strong Fire from the Alcali mixed with clay, which for all
that in its Virtues surpasses the usual Medecines, as the Sun exceeds the
Moon in splendor; And this Fiery Spirit is the same, which our Philosopher
thus highly commends to all faithful Physicians, saying: In passiva
deceptione Scholarum humoristarum cap. 1.. 89. these notable words, worthy to
be marked with golden Letters; sin vero penitiori recessu aliquid pertinacius
occultiusque restiterit, assumenda sunt Alcalia Volatilia, quae instar saponis
cuncta abstergunt; mirum sane, quantum Sal Tartari, vel unici, volatile factum,
non praestiterit, nam omnem e venis amurcam detergit, and obstruentium
contumaciam, dispergitque Apostematum suscepta conciliabula. De hoc salis (and
non olei) spiritu; verum est illud Paracelsi, quod quocumque non attigerit, vix
alius potentior perveniet; And he says also further, that they are equal in
Virtue unto the great Medicaments, and by reason of their subtle penetrating
nature do reach to the fourth digestion, his words are these. In potestate
medicaminum. 65. Fixa Alcalia si volatizentur, magnorum Pharmacorum potestates
adaequant, quippe vi incisionis, resolutionis and abstersionis, delata usque ad
limen quartae digestionis tenacitatem coagulatorum in vasis fundamentaliter
tollunt. And therefore it is highly to be wished for, that the Modern
Physicians would be persuaded by our Philosophers intimation of the great
Virtues of the Volatilised Alcalies, to endeavor to get this excellent
Treasure of health, and to employ it to the profit and great joy of their
Patients: And although this one reason would be sufficient, to move them
carefully to endeaver this preparation, yet there are two other great
advantages more to be expected from thence, viz. that not only the Essences of
all Metals, and of the whole Mineral Kingdom are to be obtained by the means of
Alcalies Volatile, as I have mentioned in the precedent Chapter with all
circumstances; but also hereby, as by a sure foundation, and the first step as
it were, they may attain unto the knowledge of the so highly commended
universal Menstruum, the Liquor Alcahest, which arises from this very ground,
as our Philosopher says expressly, de Lithiasi, cap. 8.. 2. where he answers
unto those, which desired to know of him, how to prepare the Element of Fire
out of copper? that the mystery of the Liquor Alcahest is required thereunto;
now since the Alcalies Volatile do bring the same to pass, it must needs then
follow, that the Liquor Alcahest flows from this source, wherein I have been
confirmed so much the more by our Philosophers Annotation written with his own
hand in Paracels. his great Chirurgie in the Margent. p. 102. in folo. upon the
preparation of the Tincture of Gold, where Paracelsus teaches to pour Alcool
Vini upon the Calx Auri, and that the same will extract the Anima Auri; where
our Philosopher writ thereunto: Nisi Sal circulatum in sit spiritui Vini,
Tinctura ex auro non transit in eum. Now in regard the Alcalies Volatile show
forth the same Virtue in extracting of the Metallic Tinctures, as our
Philosopher attributes here unto the Sal circulatum, it must certainly follow,
that both these proceed from the same Foundation; which also is further
confirmed by this, that our Philosopher de febribus cap. 14.. 10. does refer
himself to Raimund Lulli, as possessor of the Liquor Alcahest, in whose relict
writings we find the Doctrine of the Volatilisation of Alcalies more
excellently and largely handled, than in any other Philsophers books; and
therefore I also commended him together with our Philosopher most of all to the
Reader: from all which, as infallible arguments, I do conclude, that by
diligently exercising himself in the Volatilisation of Alcalies, one may ascend
as by a sure step unto the Mystery of the Liquor Alcahest it self, whereunto
God will raise his Elect Workmen.

CAP. IX.
How the extracted Tincture of Copper is further to be carried on to
perfection; and how it performs its Virtue and operation in the Body of Man.
THe Copper being not stated in such a perfection by Nature as gold is,
therefore the way to proceed with Copper, concerning its final perfection is
different from the process of gold in this point; for when the Tincture of this
is separated from its Body, it needs no further perfection, but then the
Anima auri is already perfect enough, because it had obtained its perfection
already by Nature, and its Maturation, before it came to the hands of the
Artist; yet hereby is not denied, but that this by nature perfected Tincture
may be made perfecter yet, and advanced to a plusquam perfection, for the same
may very well be performed by the Noble Art Chymia, as the books of the Wise do
abundantly testify: But this is besides our purpose here, it being my intent
only, according to our Philosophers guidance to subsist in the single
perfection and to set forth the same, and because the tincture of Gold has the
same already by Nature, there needs no more but to administer it to the sick
and necessitous; but the case is not the same with the Tincture of Copper; for
the Copper and its Sulphur is not fixed, but of a middle condition betwixt the
thoroughly fixed Gold, and the totally Volatile Minerals, and therefore its
Anima could easily be destroyed and consumed by the Violence of fire, if it
should not discreetly be handled; and therefore it is necessary, that according
to our Philosophers doctrine this Gold-like, cleanly separated Anima be
Coagulated and fixed, and this by the Virtue of Fire, which is able to ripen
all imperfect things, and to make them durable. But the Fire must be ordered in
this business, according to the ordinary course of the whole Nature, which from
year to year without ceasing does maturate and concoct unripe things to their
highest perfection, which maturation is performed by steps, beginning with a
gentle and weak degree of Warmth, and so rising till to the highest degree of
the greatest heat, whereby at length perfect maturity is obtained: And this
same must be the way of your proceeding, and therefore you must know, how to
govern your Fire according to Nature, that you do not give it too strong before
the time, for else you would burn and spoil this Noble Gold-like flower,
insomuch that afterward it could not show forth the tenth part of that
efficacy, which else it might, being agreeably unto Nature digested, and Fixed
slowly and by degrees. But that it may be the plainer to you how to proceed,
and that you may not easily mistake, observe but, and mind well the words of
our Philosopher, in Duumviratu.. 9. where he says first, that it must be
coagulated, and afterward fixed; Now you know, that Coagulation is to be done
by a far gentler degree o^ Fire then fixation; and therefore be but guided by
these two words, and first Coagulate softly, in regard that it is become like
Oil by the Fiery moisture of the Philosophic Menstruum, which not only reduced
the Anima Cupri back to its first radical moisture, that is to such a State, as
it was in, at its first rise or beginning; and therefore also by all the Wise
is called Reductio in primam materiam; but also this radical moisture of the
Gold-like Tincture of the Copper has some part of the essential moisture of
the Alcali Volatile remaining with it still, as I mentioned in the precedent
Chapter, wherewith the inmost of the Tincture, by reason of their uniformity in
substance, has so united it self, that each one is inclined inseparably to
remain with the other; And therefore this Noble Oil must first be coagulated by
a slow pace, to the end that it may contract it self, and so thicken and grow
tough and hard at length. And this being performed, then afterward, the other
word of our Philosopher viz. fixation must also be effected, and so the
coagulated powder leasurely carried on to such a fixation by the augumented
degree of Fire, that it may be able to undergo the strongest force of fire
without change or damage, and then it is thoroughly perfect. To which perfection
it must of necessity attain for to deserve the name of Sulphur Philosophorum,
and to be able to cure all diseases: Sulphuribus enim mineralium, says our
Philosopher p. 460. correctis atque perfectis, tota morborum cohors auscultat.
Before they are brought to this pass, viz, to be wholly perfect, it cannot be
expected that all diseases should yield unto, and flee from them, and therefore
their advancement unto perfection must of necessity be so ordered and carried
on, as even now has been taught. And when you have brought your business to
such an happy issue, you will have such a perfect Medicine, as cures not only
Vniversaliter all diseases as a true Panacaea, but also performs its
operation clean otherwise than all other Medicaments, whither made of
Vegetables or Animals. For the Sulphura or animae metallicae being a mere fire
(and therefore also called by the Philosophers Elementum ignis, in Metals and
Minerals) they also perform their operation, as fire uses to do according to
its nature, viz. by warming or illuminating; so this noble Tincture of Copper
shows forth its virtue in warming; hence it is called by our Philosopher
excellens calidum, very much warming in Duumviratu.. 9 And then secondly, by
Illumination, for it illuminateth and raises the life-spirit, called by our
Philosopher Archeus, and minds the same of its office, furnishing it also
with Light, Power and Virtue: for although this noble Tincture has no
combustible or consumptible Light now, nor is such as it was before in its
first rise, as likewise Gold it self, viz. a combustible Sulphur, and so
consequently a terminat or extinguishable Light, and therefore also now does
not light forth after a common or visible way, as the kindled Sulphura
Mineralia do; yet notwithstanding the same being stated by art into a much
higher and more excellent condition then it was by nature, does now lighten in
a far more eminent way, and casts forth its unchangeable and interminable
light and splendor; for now, as its nature is invincible by fire, and so
become a far more excellent fire than the common so likewise its light is far
more eminent and reaching than the common corruptible light, because that its
light is interminable and such as will never cease, in regard that its Light
answers the nature of its substance, which being incorruptible, consequently
its Light also is indestructible and inconsumptible; and therefore being
received into the stomach of Man, the stomach cannot act upon it, nor change
it; but only suffers it self and its indwelling Archeus to be warmed,
illuminated, and irradiated by this heavenly Tincture, which done, this
Tincture without any change goes away through the natural draught, in its
former weight, efficacy and splendor; and it is able infinitely again and
again to exsert and show forth the same power, virtue and help, which it has
shown before, if it be picked out of the excrements and made use of again. Our
Philosopher teaches the same very profoundly, and with a through satisfaction
unto a truth desirous mind, whereof I will here set down a singular passage of
high concernment, out of his book and tract called, In Verbis, Herbis and
Lapidibus magna est virtus, that you may have it here together, and need not
look for it there: Mark and ponder the same well, for many Mysteries lie hidden
in it. His words are these, Radialis commistio argenti vivi admiranda est, si
argentum vivum macereturin magna aquae communis quantitate; haec namque etsi ne
minimum quid de argento vivo in se sorbeat, aut ad sui naturam convertere
queat, attamen ab argento vivo proprietatem, non item substantiam mutuat, sic
ut pota aqua ejusmodi necet lumbricos universos and ascarides, existentes
etiam, quo potus iste nunquam pervenit, quippe qui mox totus in lotium rapitur,
fitque aqua ista contra lumbricos validior, si semel cum argento vivo
bullierit; sic unica uncia argenti vivi millies poterit mensuram aquae
inficere, attamen permanere in pondere and proprietate pristinis. Sic nempe
Scholae etiam invitae addiscunt, quod quaedam agentia citra passionem aut
reactionem patientium, libere semper, indefessisque viribus agant, and
perstante eodem sui semper pondere. Argentum vivum nempe agit in aquam, eique
impri mit sui characterem, non tamen vicissim quidquam ab aqua repatitur.
Manifestum est itaque, quod vis quaedam medica transferatur, mutetque suum
subjectum natural, et abeat in objectum peregrinum solo velut radio vel
aspectu sui, ita tamen ut licet objectum peregrinum acquirat exoticam sibivim,
agens tamen inspiransque initium, ne quidquam de suo pristino robore aut
pondere amittat, remittatque fit nempe id absque ulla argenti vivi passione,
diminutione, mutatione, debilitate aut alteritate. Exemplum sane hoc loco
adductum inservit argumento de virtute propemodum infinita remediorum
celebranda. Quae res postquam in Mineralibus saepe ac diversi-mode subter
experientiam tracta fuisset, me edocuit tandem, quod antehac nemo mortalium
fortassis adhuc optice atque intus perspexisset; qualiter remedia abstrusiora
operarentur, quodque nimirum citra sui dissolutionem aut interitum, citra sui
penetrationem, intro-admissionem, commisturam and commutationem libere etiam
eminus, agant in sopitum vel succensum Archeum, so lo quasi sui aspectu,
irradiatione vel ejaculatione suarum virium in medio productarum, retentis
adhuc pristinis and non mutatis (NB) pondere and proprietatibus, adeoque
TESTANTVR EJVSMODI ARCANA, SE INFINITAE BONITATE PROPINQVA, dum propemodum ac
quasi infinitas sensim vires spargant. Quapropter non impunes manebunt medici,
dum pauperes quandoque se neglectos ejulabunt in judicio novissimo, qui absque
impensis ullis facile atque obiter sanari potuissent. Igitur arcana nequeunt
unquam abire in alimentum, quia servant suos fines, ut quae non in cibos, sed
in pharmaca sunt destinata, pharmaca perseverent intro assumpta: incipiunt
namque in stomacho (quem animae sedem alibi ex professo demonstravi) radium
directum suarum virium ac virtutem dotalem exponere, and quorsum a Deo
destinata sunt, unde demum in totum corpus spargitur hausta in Archeo vis
radialis irrorata, and sanitas inde succedens avide suscipitur. Sic nimirum
oblatis hujusmodi universalioribus remediis contingunt sanationes, quales
prodidi in foute naturae contingere ac eidem deberi, qualesque Paracelsus
pollicitus est, ac dein Butlerus me spectante, minima videlicet
confermentationis applicatione est executus. Certe postquam haec speculatio
penitiori contemplatione me sub se attraxit, clarissime ac optice quasi
cognovi, in causis occasionalibus ac in productis excrementitiis quidem haerere
sordes, peculiarium morborum suscitatrices; attamen ipsum morbum totum ejusque
remedia, considero in Archeo scilicet alterato vel pacato, adeoque minimo
attactu, vibratione, jaculatione, imo sola radiatione sive illuminatione (modo
in sede animae sensitivam vitam attigerint) perfici ac compleri sanationes, non
habito causarum occasionalium aspectu. Idque potentius aspicio in Mineralium
remediis Sulphureis, puta in Sulphur Veneris, stibii, ac potissimum in
Sulphur Glaurae Augurelli: quae Nympha alio nomine proprio caret hactenus.
Etenim ejusmodi Sulphura, quia longius distant ab humana natura, quam tota
vegetabilium cohors, atque interca insignes dotes a Datore obtinent, ita quoque
plenissime and pertinaciter resistunt, ne a digestiva in alimentorum
rempublicam deflectant, atque ideo servent geneales sui potestates liberas and
infractas. Manet nimirum Mineralium crasis integra, aptiorque ad dispergendum
radium sui in Duumviratum sedem animae. Sic nempe Mercurius Diaphoreticus
ultimatum suae Entelechiae scopum acquirit per ruborem Sulphuris ascendentis,
cui Sulphur Mercurii unione indissolubili nectitur; Hactenus euim Mineralium
Sulphura sub Vulcano adipiscuntur extremum intentionis medentum complementum.
Hortor itaque tyrones addiscant Sulphura spoliar^ vi peregrina ac virulenta,
sub ejus nimirum custodia abditur ignis vitalis, Archeum in scopos desideratos
placidissime deducens. Sunt videlicet Sulphura quaedam, quibus correctis atque
perfectis tota morborum cohors auscultat, utpote quorum pluralitas in unitatem
Archei, tanquam in pugnantem pugnum contrahitur. Hoc pacto in ipsa animae sede
combinatoque Duumviratu, amentiae appoplexiae, caduci, paralyses, vertigines,
asthmata, hydropes, atrophiae, immanesque defectus annihilari vidimus, stupente
scilicet ipsa natura.

By which excellent discourse four secrets are discovered: First, that the
Sulphurs of Metals and Minerals, by the Artists hand being corrected and
perfected, or brought to the highest perfection, viz. fixation, do then
universally heal all diseases. Secondly, that they show forth this heavenly
virtue after the nature and manner of a shining Light, enlightening all dark
places and corners, that even so the Metallic fixed Arcana medica with their
splendor and wonderful Light (by God bestowed upon them) do illuminate and
irradiate the Archeus, which is darkened and obumbrated by Diseases, injecting
new powers of Light into him, and raising him to a new Life, in which sense I
gave this Treatise the Title of a Medicinal light, because therein I plainly
showed (out of our highly gifted and illuminated Philosopher) the way to obtain
such a glorious Light, eminent for the restoring of health, insomuch that every
one that is chosen for it by God, and borne to it by Nature, and so is
dupliciter electus, may easily attain to this Mystery of the Light of Nature.
Thirdly, this Text teaches also, that these Metallic Arcana of Light, after
they have afforded their great help and shown forth their power, are never a
whit diminished either in their substance or weight, but remain in their former
quantity, and unchanged and incorrupted in their heavenly virtue, power and
quality, and may be used again and again without end. Fourthly, that these
three now mentioned great Virtues and unexpressible powers, have their rise
from the neernesse of the Metallic Arcana with the eternal infinite goodness,
which is the invisible heavenly substance, and that as to their inward root,
they are one degree nearer to, and deeper in the interior heavenly World, than
all other Visible, Palpable and Corruptible created things, us our Author
intimates in these words, Adeoque testantur ejusmodi arcana, se infinitae
bonitati propinqua, etc. Which great wonder of God and Nature, hitherto utterly
unknown to, and hidden from Men, has by divine irradiation been discovered as
it were afar off, by our Philosopher, but not so genuinely and entirely known
to him as to all its parts, as it was to that highly illuminated and anointed
instrument of God, the German or Teutonick Philospher and wonder-man, Jacob
Bohmen of Gorlitz, who not only in his books de signatura rerum de tribus
principiis, Mysterio magno de Triplici vita, and more others, does very
profundly and completely explain this Mystery, but also speaks of and
teaches other and the greatest mysteries of God, and of his manifested Nature,
with such exuberant wisdom, that one must be astonished at the great and
profound knowledge, which this highly illuminated Man of God had, as well in
divine as natural secrets, and by the command, instinct and merciful will of
God has left unto us in his books, whereof he writ above thirty. Wherein are
comprehended the greatest hitherto hidden Mysteries of God, what he is in his
Essence, and in his holy Trine-Number or Trinity of persons, how before all
created visible things he has created an eternal Nature, of which afterward
he made the Angels, and how it came to pass, that some fell and raised the
eternal otherwise hidden darkness for their eternal habitation; Others, on the
other side, persisted in the place of their Creation, and so are confirmed in
their state of holiness; Also, how God further in the room of the fallen and
rejected Angels created Men in the very same place, from which Lucifer was
thrusted forth or ejected, and how that Lucifer envying this happiness unto
man, seduced and persuaded him to fall from God, and cunningly beguiled him;
all which the infinite mercy of God knowing from eternity, resolved already
from Eternity with himself, to look in mercy upon this poor, by the subtlety
and fraud of Satan, fallen Man, and to come to his assistance with his holy
substance of the inexhaustible Loves-Source it self, to unite the same with the
fallen humane Nature, and so with a strong might and Divine power to destroy
the design of Satan, through the fallen humane Nature, and so eternally to
possess his former Seat or Throne; and how all this properly came to pass that
the eternal infinite God united himself indivisibly with humane Nature, and by
such an union opened again the Gate unto the Kingdom of Heaven unto all
Mankind: And how Man must be born again the second time through this, and so
united again with the substance and body of God, and become a true child of
God, borne out of him, and in this manner may eternally be and remain with him.
All this and very many other Mysteries of the like nature; as also of the
exterior Nature of Metals, and their heavenly Virtues, of Herbs, Beasts, Sun,
Moon and Stars, and of the generation of the whole Nature, and all exterior
visible things, yea of the great stone of the Wise also, are in his books so
profoundly and knowingly handled and described, that every hungry and truth
desirous mind cannot sufficiently rejoice and delight himself in such a high
light and exposition of such hitherto unheard of, and altogether hidden
wonders, and I am of opinion, that the bottomless mercy of God has set up
this Jacob Bohme (whom the learned after his death by reason of his great
wisdom called the Teutonick Philosopher) and also this our Philosopher
Helmont, as two bright-shining torches for this present age, which is the dregs
and sinck of all ungodliness, unbelief, wickedness, and perverse damnable
life, to try whither this Modern Lip-Christendom, which is quite dead as to
God, and totally alienated from the Life of God, will open their eyes and see
by this double Light of his mercy set up, and so acknowledge or own God their
most blessed Creator, walk in his light, and bring forth the due fruit of
Holiness and Obedience, before the terrible Wrath of God rush in upon them
consuming, devouring and destroying all such unfruitful Trees, which Vengeance
is already begun: Therefore, Happy and Blessed is he, that acknowledges the
same, and follows this Light, which God by these two Men of wonders
mercifully granted unto us, and enters into the way of true child-like
obedience of faith, for to be a true Labourer in his Vineyard, as a good
husbandman over the work of the Lord, such a one may confidently hope for the
fruit, which God by these Instruments promised unto us, and not only receive
them yet in this World, but also enjoy them eternally. Therefore be admonished,
O you Physicians, such as have yet a spark of the Child-like fear of God in
your hearts, by what the tuba of this Age, our Philosopher, in praefatione
super Ignotum hospitem morbum, says. 9. 10. Moneo hortorque sapientes hujus
mundi, quod errores and inscitiae Medentum non se mihi paulatim aperuerint, ac
sensim intrarint in animam meam, ita quod unum post aliud conceperim aut
meditatus sim; nimirum quod primum considerarem scholas deceptas circa
mistionum. Elementarium congressum, temperiem, complexiones, morbosasque
distemperaturas, inde vero provolutus essem circa errores Catharrorum, ac
deinceps demum quaesiissem radices, causas and quidditatem morborum ac
remediorum. Nil sane horum. Nam si unum post aliud mihi innotuisset,
existimassem omnem hujusmodi progressum, esse rationis ac Phantasiae
inductiones erroribus atque fallaciis opportunas. Sed postquam totum simul,
nempe Medentum inscitiae, tam in cognitione causarum, morborum, quam remediorum
and applicationum, unica lucis fulguratione conceptum intellectualem
obumbrasset, indubie cognovi, hoc talentum ad proximorum utilitates datum,
ideoque propinandum Cathedris, a quibus correctio expetitur expectaturque,
iisque sub indictione gravioris paenae serio proferendum.

CAP. X.
That the Sulphur Philosophorum is also to be had from other Metallic bodies,
besides the Copper.
THere will be not a few, which after they have read the, by me cleared,
Doctrine of our Philosopher, concerning the Sulphur Philosophorum, may chance
to be of opinion, that only the Tincture of Copper is that highly commended
Sulphur of the Wise, and that we must remain only with this Subject, and only
thence look for this Noble treasure of health. But no such matter; for the
Anima Cupri is called Sulphur Philosophorum, not in regard of any singular
prerogative and precedence it has before other Metallic bodies, but only
therefore, because it is conducible for a long and healthful Life, and
therefore as a great secret is only sought for by Wise and Understanding Men,
who aimed not at money, riches, honor, pride, and Lust of the flesh, nor would
they spend their precious time upon such fading muck, but on the contrary they
employed all their understanding and knowledge (vouchsafed unto them by God
upon their hearty prayers) hereupon only viz. how to preserve a sound mind
within a sound body, and to make this use of the Virtues which God endowed
Nature withal, that they might remain in health and enjoy a long Life, thereby
to have the fruition of the great wonders and gifts of God for many years, and
so to be able in health to bear much fruit unto their gracious Lord God, as
faithful Laborers in his Vineyard, as our Philosopher witnesses in Butler,
page 473. in these words: Nihil aeque victoriose in humidum radicale agit atque
primum ens Cupri, vel ad vitam longam Sulphur Vitrioli esse benignius, utpote
quod idcirco Sulphur Philosophorum indigetat; and in Duumviratu says he:
Sulphur Cupri inter arcana ad vitam longam, and catervam aliquot morborum
fugandam, commendabile; and de Lithiasi cap. 8.. 8. he says: Cum Sulphur istud
externum, quale e Cupro trahitur, non sit necessarium metallo perfecto; Cupro
autem istud Sulphur sit a Deo inditum, ergo necesse est istud Sulphur Veneris
habere suos fines ad necessitates ingrati hominis conducentes, pro
infirmitatibus scilicet humanis, supra omnem metallicae perfectionis
dignitatem. In regard therefore, that the Tincture of copper is called Sulphur
Philosophorum only for this reason, because it is advantageous for a long and
healthy Life; but now such an universal Medicine also may be made of other
Metallic Bodies; it must needs follow, that in other Metallic Subjects also
such a Sulphur Philosophorum may be found, and that it is not necessary to
remain only with the Copper; but that I treat most of Copper in this book, and
make but little mention of the other Metallic Bodies, is done therefore,
because I proposed unto my self to subsist in our Philosophers Doctrine, which
he left unto us, and intended most of all to clear the same in this Treatise,
whom, because he makes mention of the Anima Cupri, I followed here. Else, all
Metallic Bodies may thus be proceeded withal and analyzed, and the Tincture
obtained in like manner, as here of Copper has been taught, which by due
maturation having attained unto its perfection, is likewise the Philosophers
Sulphur, as well as the Tincture of Copper; And therefore the method pointed
out for to obtain from Copper its Anima, may also be observed in dissecting of
other Metallic Bodies, and it is not necessary to enlarge further of it, they
being all comprehended within the compass of one and the same process; But let
not the Reader think, that by the word Metallic Bodies, I mean only the known,
and by every one called Metals, as Gold, Lead, Tin, Iron, etc. by no means, for
if this had been my meaning, I would not have put Metallic Bodies, but Metals
in the Title of this Chapter; but by the word Metallic Subjects I understand
such Minerals, which have the like fixedness as Metals, which though they may
not be melted like other Metals, yet therefore are to be named Metallic,
because they have not only the like fixedness; all Metals, but also approach
very near unto Gold in point of fixedness, and consequently I understand by the
word Metallic bodies, as well all Metals, as also all that has the like
constancy as Metals have: But that in such Metallic Subjects the like virtue,
yea as high is engrafted as in the Metals themselves, yea almost as good as in
Gold, let not the Reader think it strange, but rather hear first, what the
highly guifted Paracelsus hereof mentions, and afterward understand also my
information; Now Paracelsus intending to show, which Subjects besides the known
Metals participate of the primum ens auri (which is the true Sulphur
Philosophorum) says de separationibus rerum naturalium. p. m. 906. sub titulo
of the separation of Minerals: Now it is further requisite and necessary to
treat of those things whereof Metals grow and engender, as the three Principia,
Mercurius, Sulphur and Sal; also other Minerals, in which the primum Ens
Metallorum is found, that is the spirit of Metals, as you see in Marcasites,
Granats, Kakimia, red Talck, Lasur, etc. and the like, wherein we have found
the primum ens auri, by the degree of sublimation, etc. of this primum ens you
are to know, that it is a Volatile Spirit, which still lies in the Volatility,
even as a Child in the Woman's womb, (and therefore also these Sulphura are
called by Paracelsus in other places Sulphura Embryonata) which sometimes
resembles unto a Liquor, and sometimes unto an Alcool. Now he that intends
to have the primum ens of every one of those bodies, and to sever the same from
thence, must of necessity have great experience in the Spagyrick Art, and have
much worked in Alchymie, else he will little effect here, but rather loose his
labor. But for as much as concerns the separation of Minerals, it is to be
noted, that many such things are separated by the degree of sublimation, the
fixed from the unfixed, all spiritual and Volatile bodies from the fixed, and in
like manner as you have understood of Metals, so with all the other Minerals
one and the same process is to be used through all degrees, as the Spagyrick
art does teach, etc. Hitherto Paracelsus. Whereby we clearly see that one and
the same process is to be used to sever the pure, or the Primum Ens, that is,
the goldlike soul from Minerals (as Paracelsus calls them here, but by me are
termed Metallic bodies, not only in regard of the forementioned reason,
because they stand in the like fixity with metals, but also to distinguish them
from other Minerals that are wholly Volatile which properly are called Minerals
by me, whereof mention shall be made in the following Chapter) as also from
Metals, and that it must be done by Volatilisation, as I have faithfully taught
before. Also Paracelsus teaches us what subjects those are, in which as well
the primum Ens Auri (which is the true Sulphur Philosophorum) is contained, as
in the Metals, viz. in Marcasites, Garnets, Kakimia, red Talck, Lasur, etc.
which though it be certainly so, and experience also confirms the same,
especially in the Garnets and red Talck, in which an extraordinary fair
Goldlike Tincture lies hidden, yet there are other Corpora also, wherein the
Sulphur Philosophorum is as excellent as in these, viz. in the Magnes, Smiris,
Vitriol, Rubrica, Lapis Calaminaris, and of all most rich and plentifully in
the Lapis Haemathites, which is thoroughly replenisht with the primum Ens Auri.
And therefore also crude and unprepared, if it be but only first ground and
reduced into a very fine and impalpable powder, shows forth most excellent
virtues in Physic, as experience will verify unto the diligent searcher of the
secrets of Nature. And it is also known in the famous City of Hamburg, what
great cures about twenty years ago have been done there by a Scotch man, who
was but an Idiot, insomuch that all the City were astonished at it; but by the
envy and hatred of wicked men he was quickly rid out of the way, and killed
with poison, and is much bemoaned by all, and therefore by the Magistrate there
(as I am credibly informed) is set a great sum of money to find out him that
has committed that murder. Now this man used nothing else but the Haemathites
ground to an impalpable powder, and afterward ground with oil of Fennel seeds,
as the late most Illustrious Prince, Duke Augustus of Anhalt, of happy memory
has told me, and with much industry got it from the Author: These great
Virtues of the Haemathites are also known to many of the common people in
diverse countries, in so much that great Territories are to be found, in which
the use of it is so well known, and so highly esteemed, that they use it as a
Panacaea in all their infirmities, as among the rest appeared unto me in the
Dukedom of Borussia: for traveling once from my parents in law unto the fair
at Konigsberg for to buy some necessaries, I took a peasant with me for to
carry my luggage for me, and coming to a Mercers that had all kind of Wares, as
Whetstones, Firestones, Table-books and the like, and mong the rest
Blood-stones also, which the Peasant espying, he made unto me a very low
courtesy, and very humble prayed me, that I would buy and bestow upon him such
a red stone (for he knew not its proper name to call it by) for a fairing,
which he would acknowledge for a singular favor and love unto him. I demanded
what he would do with it? He answered, Dear Sir, if you knew what excellent
virtues are in this stone, you would likkwise highly esteem of it: I said, what
can it do? He replied, This is our Medicine, when we aile any thing, then we
grind it very small, and take it with a little Vinegar, and thereupon recover
our health; Afterward coming home again, I asked my father in Law, whither
that there was such a custom amongst his Boores, as to take their refuge unto
the Boodstone in all their diseases? To which he answered, yea, adding, that
not only there near him, but also in all that circuit questionless there was
that custom amongst the Boores. This his Gold-like virtue, his signature also
shows forth, not in his outward appearance of an unfightly brown stone, but
being dissolved: For if you make a very strong Aqua Regis of the spirit of
Saltpeter drawn off from common salt (for common Aqua Regis, made after the
usual way of Aqua fort and Salt Ammoniac, dissolveth so little of it, that it
is not worth the pains) and dissolve therein the Haemathites made into very
fine powder, keeping it in a due heat: and if you dissolve also of the
choicest, and pure-finest Gold in the like Aqua Regis, and compare the
solutions together, you will see, that the solution of the Haemathites shows
as glorious and of as fair* a Gold color as the other of the best Gold, yea
rather exceeds in splendor. And therefore let not the Reader wonder at it,
that Paracelsus, and I also do hold, that in many other subjects, besides the
Gold (which deservedly has the pre-eminence above all, and its tincture is
Eminenti Gradu called Sulphur philosophorum by the wise, which none will deny,
unless he be quite a stranger unto, unacquainted with, and altogether
unexercised in Philosophia Chymica) and the Copper, the primum Ens Auri, or
Sulphur Philosophorum is to be found, their great virtues showing forth the
same, and as expressed seals of bountiful nature, convincing us of that truth.

CAP. XI.
That the Sulphur Philosophorum may be got also of Volatile Minerals.
WHat I have taught in the precedent Chapter, viz. that also of such other
Metallic bodies which are of the like fixity with the Metals, the Sulphur
Philosophorum is to be obtained, this may peradventure sooner be received and
granted by the Reader, than what I am now going to demonstrate, viz. that of
the wholly volatile Minerals, such as Antimony, Auripigmentum, Zink, and the
like, that same Treasure of health may also be extracted. However not only
Experience, but also many wise men in their books do witness this truth, which
I do intend to prove in this Chapter. And although it be besides my purpose, to
treat of the Volatile Minerals, and the treasure of health contained in them,
and that this Treatise reaches only thus far, viz. according to our
Philosophers Doctrine and instruction, faithfully to explain the way to get the
Sulphur Philosophorum from Copper especially, and within the compass of that
process also, how the Tincture of life is to be had of the other Metals and
Metallic bodies; yet I cannot forbear (in regard that the Sulphur
Philosophorum as well made of Volatile Minerals, as also of the fixer Metallic
bodies, is altogether of one and the same Nature, Property, Power and Virtue)
here to mention how that Jewel is to be got of the Minerals also. To make it
the more plain for the longing seeker of Truth, be it known to him first in
General, that as the Volatile Minerals are very much different from the fixed
Metallic bodies, in that the former are altogether Volatile, open, and very
near unto the first being; on the other side, the Metallic subjects are fast
coagulated and locked up by nature and its fire, and so these twofold subjects,
as to their inbred nature and condition, do very much differ: so likewise there
is a vast difference in their preparation, for the volatile Minerals neither
must nor need at all to be proceeded with, like the fixer Metallic Subjects,
which first by potent double corrosives must be freed from their hard bonds,
and raised as it were from death, and so quickened, which is altogether
unnecessary in the volatile Minerals, because that they never yet entered into
such a hard coagulation, nor were locked up in death as it were, but are still
Volatile, lively, and active: and therefore also another method of proceeding
must be used about them. Also the way of getting the Medicinal Treasure from
Minerals being not one and the same in all, but Various, viz. in each Mineral a
sundry way, according to our Philosophers instruction; therefore also I will
mention the preparation of one or other by it self, as far as our Philosopher
does give occasion. First, our Philosopher commends unto us the Sulphura
Mineralium in general and indistinctly, when he teaches that they being
corrected and perfected, will then cure all or most diseases, which
sufficiently evidenceth, that after they have attained unto that perfection,
that then they are the Sulphur Philosophorum, as well as other metallic
bodies, because that the Nature and condition of the Sulphur Philosophorum is
to be a Panacaea, which being asserted by our Philosopher of the mineral
Sulphurs also, they are therefore also of the same dignity with the others,
because that they cure Vniversaliter the infirmities of Humane bodies as well
as the other, whereof our Philosophers words, in his Discourse quoted in the
ninth chap. are these: Ipsum morbum totum ejusque remedia considero in Archeo
alterato vel pacato, adeoque minimo attactu, vibratione, jaculatione, imo sola
radiatione sive illuminatione perfici ac compleri sanationes, non habito
causarum occasionalium respectu; idque potentius aspicio in mineralium remediis
Sulphureis, puta in Sulphur Veneris, Stibii, ac potissimum in Sulphur Glaurae
Augurelli, quae Nympha alio nomine proprio caret hactenus, etc. Hortor itaque
Tyrones, addiscant sulphura spoliare vi peregrina ac virulenta, sub cujus
nimirum custodia abditur ignis vitalis, Archeum in scopos desideratos
placidissime deducens: sunt videlicet Sulphura quaedam, quibus correctis atque
perfectis tota morborum cohors auscultat, ut pote quorum pluralitas in unitatem
Archei tanquam pugnantem pugnum contrahitur. Hoc pacto in ipsa animae sede
combinatoque Duumviratu, amentiae, apoplexiae, caduci, paralyses, vertigines,
asthmata, hydropes, atrophiae, immanesque defectus annihilari vidimus, stupente
scilicet ipsa Natura. In which discourse our Philosopher names unto us three
sorts of the Sulphur Philosophorum, that is of such a Tincture which
Vniversaliter, as a true Panacaea, heals diseases; the first sort he takes
from the Copper, whereof hitherto sufficiently has been spoken, and which does
not properly belong to this Chapter, but to the Metallic bodies.

The other sort he says, is made of the Glaura Augurelli, which he calls in
another place viz. inter imperfectiora, Metallus primus, sive masculus (as much
to say as Pater Metallorum) and inter arcana Paracelsi he terms it also
Electrum minerale immaturum, and declares, that this Mineral has a
combustible Sulphur, which is the King of all Mineral Sulphurs, and therefore
also the highest Tincture for health is prepared of it, which for that reason
is called quinta essentia membrorum, and arcanum Tincturae by Paracelsus. Now
this Mineral as it is hidden, and known to very few (and hence not called by
its proper name by our Philosopher, but only Nympha) as to its nature: so, and
much more secret is its* Philosophic preparation, whereby its Volatile
combustible, stinking, unripe Sulphur, is exalted to the glory and dignity of
Sulphur Philosophorum, yea so highly, that after it has attained unto its
highest perfection, it surpasses all other Philosophic Sulphurs as far in
splendor and glory, as the Sun the other Stars: and therefore also our
Philosopher relating and commending the above mentioned three kinds, he adds
the word especially, or above all other, to this Sulphur; and hence also
numbering up the Arcana Paracelsi, he sets this uppermost, expressly mentioning,
that this Arcanum is the greatest of all, saying: Imprimis tinctura Lili ab
Electro minerali immaturo in vinum vitae redacta, cujus una pars est Metallus
primus, altera vero membrorum essentia. But the manner how to obtain this great
Jewel, and King of all the Arcana, he expresses thus: that first the
combustible Sulphur (which if it be burnt yields a blew flame) is to be
separated from its Mercurial body, which may be done after that way as has
been taught of Antimony in the second Chapter, for so long as the Minerals are
still Volatile, open and combustible, one process serves for all, for to
separate their Sulphur from them, viz. by a fiery Alcali; Upon this severed
Sulphur is to be poured its own (pertinent and only serviceable) corrosive
(which is nothing else but the Liquor Alcahest, as appears by all
circumstances) and distilled and cohobated thence, until the Sulphur come over
like a red Oil, etc. which not being practicable or feasible by any other but
him that is Possessor of the Liquor Alcahest, therefore we will wave it, and
not frustraneously detain our selves there, for he that has that Liquor,
needs not our instruction: but to him that has it not, it is but labor lost
to mention any thing of it, and to propose unto him any good conceptions. And
therefore we will pass to the other, and by all feasible way, to obtain this
high Tincture of health, which our Philosopher also points out: for he
knowing well, that the partakers of the Mystery of the Liquor Alcahest are but
very few, and yet out of his true assection and hearty love to the longing
searcher of truth being willing, that the efficacy of this most excellent and
noblest Sulphur might be known in some sort, he left such a way of proceeding,
which is practicable by every one, that is but a little experienced in
Philosophia Chymica, yet this kind of essence requires and presupposes, that
this highly commended and excellent Subject be first known; for none can have
experience of its glory, nor manifest its great virtues, unless he know it
first: But it seems unto me, that our Philosopher gives sufficient
information for to know it, in that he calls it Electrum mineral^ immaturum,
item Metallum primum; also in that he says of it, that it has a combustible
Sulphur, and a Volatile Mercury, his words inter imperfectiora are these:
Metallus primus sive masculus ab indole metallica necessario vestitur Mecurio
and Sulphur Metallicis. Mercurio nempe liquido nec digitis adhaerente, and
Sulphur cremabili in flamma coerulea; and then he ascribes unto it also that
heavenly Virtue, viz. to oppose withcraft, and to destroy the same, as he
writes de injaculatis. 7. Inprimis electrum minerale immaturum Paracelsi,
collo appensum, liberat quos spiritus immundus persequitur, quod ipsus vidi.
Illius potum vero, plures a veneficiis solvisse, memini; Nemo autem, qui
appenso illo simplici non praecaverit, ne injecta intromittantur, vel ab
importunis ligationibus confestim non solvatur, which virtue and great power I
have seen verifyed by experience in my own little Son, who being then but
sixteen weeks old, and forspoken by Wicked Diabolical people, or fettered
importunis ligationibus malevolorum (as our Philosopher here terms it) for
many days, insomuch that it was a great grief of heart unto us to behold the
poor distressed infant, for he would not accept of the Mothers breast for many
days, notwithstanding that he was very hungry and thirsty, and therefore was
starved and consumed. Then I remembered our Philosophers commendation of this
noble Subject, and and so hung it to the child's neck, and let it hang down to
the very pit of the Stomach, and so caused him to be wrapped up in his swaddling
cloths, and presently he fell asleep, after an hour and a half he wakened, and
desired and eagerly fell to suck the Mothers breast, and so he amended from
that very hour, to the great admiration of my self and many others, in regard
that the change was so sudden and so powerful, so that I am of opinion, that
others also by these described properties will learn to know this Royal
Subjectum; and so is needless, for the sake of those that are worthy, to name
it by a more express and significant name, than Electrum immaturum, Pater
metallorum sive Metallus primus, in regard that such and the like names do
sufficiently express what it is, and truly it would not be well done at all,
to describe it more plainly, for these Names do like a Printed Seal Represent
its whole Nature, Essence, Rise and Property, and he that can not discover it
by these Characters, is neither chosen of God, nor born by Nature for to know
it, else he would well understand this Language Metallus primus, and the like,
viz. what the said words and names do speak and express. This precious subject
(which Paracelsus calls the Red Lion, but Basilius the God Saturn) being
known, it is further necessary, that the Sulphur be severed from the Mercurial
part, in like manner as has been done with Antimony; for this solar splendor
must be first ground very fine, then mixed with a very fiery Alcali, and then
for half a quarter of an hour ground together in a Mortar, then water poured
on, and afterward filtred, and that which is contained in the water, that run
through the filter, precipitated with an Acid Liquor, and then that excellent
Sulphur will fall to the bottom, which being dried is of a yellow color, and
burns like other Sulphur, yielding a celestial, or Skie-coloured flame; as our
Philosopher mentions; but the Mercurial part remains in the Paper, which
being dried is kept for other uses; yet this I must mention here also, that
there is yet another way to sever the Mercury from this noble Sulphur, viz. by
elevating the mercurial part by means of such a degree of Fire as is requisite,
and then it will ascend alone, and leave its red Companion in the bottom; but
this way is not for our purpose, because thereby the Sulphur which remains in
the bottom will be very much fixed and altered from its former combustible
condition; which ought not to be in this work, as the following Mechanica left
by our Philosopher does show forth; for he will have, that the Sulphur Metalli
primi be dissolved in oil of Cinnamon, which cannot be done, unless that this
Sulphur remain thoroughly Volatile and Combustible, and therefore we must
Acquiesce in the first way.

Take therefore very pure and subtle Oil of Cinnamon, pour it upon the said
combustible Sulphur, put it in a phiol, and let it boil till the Oil be very
red and rich of the Tincture; then pour it into a Retort, abstract the oil
gently, so long as it comes clear, and when by gentle heat nothing more will
come over, then let it cool, and you will have in the Retort a thick and red
extract like congealed blood, which keep: the clear oil that came over, pour
again into the Phiol, and add more of the Sulphur Metalli primi to it, in case
there be not enough in it, boil it again for twelve or more hours, and your
oil will be very red again, which after Refrigeration put into the former
Retort to the first thick extract, and abstract as before the oil gently, so
long as it goes clear; the Oil that came over pour again the third time to the
Sulphur in the Phiol and let it boil as before; and being well colored, pour
it also into the Retort to the other extract: And now put the Retort somewhat
deeper in the sand than before; first draw off gently the clear oil, and none
such coming more, then strengthen the fire a little, but not too much, (that
this noble flower may not suffer violence) and there will come over first a
yellow and then a red oil, pour all that is come over back again and distill
in the same manner again, and there will come over more yellow and red oil;
this cohobation reiterate so long and often until your Oil do come over so red
that it could not be redder, which is a sign that the Oil cannot contain and
carry over any more of the mollified Sulphur, which you may easily know by its
not increasing in redness after several cohobations. This tinged Oil you must
well mix and grind together, with a very dry pure Alcali warmed a little, upon
a stone warmed also, work it together for an hour or two, that it be like a
thin honey, and take heed that you put in not too much of the Oil, for all that
Oil which is not exactly mixed with the Alcali, and so not touched by it, but
stands over the same, exceeds the true proportion, and cannot be meliorated
by the Alcali. Then put your mixture into a little Cucurbit, and let it by day
and by night, for some weeks, digest together, in such a soft or gentle heat,
that the oil may not ascend, and it will at length all turn to Salt and grow
hard, which being forced by a stronger fire yields a red Salt, the virtue
whereof will commend it self.

Now we will also speak of the third subject, whereof our Philosopher makes
mention, and commends the same unto us, viz. of Antimony, and try whether in
this also the Sulphur Philosophorum be hid, which questionless must be so,
since it is related and put in company with the Arcanum Cupri and Glaurae, by
our Philosopher. Now to extract the same out of this subject, Know that it
cannot be brought to its highest perfection after the same manner as the
Glaura, in regard that this of its nature and first rise is far more highly
nobilitated than the Antimony, and therefore also needs no more but only to
be opened and softened so, as that it may be able to play upon our Archeus, and
communicate thereunto its radius and splendor, and hence also by reason of the
great prerogative it has above all other mineral Sulphurs, it is called by our
Philosopher, the highest and greatest wonder of Nature, but the Anima Antimonii
must first be ripened and digested by a due Fire, before it can attain to such
an excellency. But how to go about this work, and concerning the genuine way to
proceed therewith, our Philosopher has not left us sufficient instruction, but
directs us unto Paracelsus, speaking of this Arcanum in Pharmacopolio and
Dispensatorio Moderno*. 49. thus: Id Paracelsus (nimirum correctionem veneni in
Antimonio) in Tinctura Lili Antimonii cum laud attentavit, per salem suum
circulatum: and amongst the Arcana Paracelsi our Philosopher sets this Sulphur
Philosophorum Antimonii in the third place, saying, Tertio loco est tinctura
Lili Antimonialis, ejusdem pone efficaciae, etc. We must therefore turn to
Paracelsus his Writings, and search there, in what place he taught to prepare
the Arcanum Lili ex Antimonio, and we shall find it in his great Chyrurgia lib.
2. tr. 3. cap. 5. where he speaks of this Sulphur Philosophorum thus: The
Philosophers have tried much with Antimony, and prepared the same many ways,
but the true way has not been found with them yet, but now it is come to
light, and it is such a science, which all Physicians of right should know: For
this purification is the entry and beginning in all Diseases, whatever they be:
and if it were in use, there would not so much be spoiled as is done by the
supposed Physicians: For therefore I call them supposed, because in all their
ways and doings, they do but only suppose, and know nothing of a certainty,
which is a very great shame to Physicians. Now its preparation is this: but he
that will apprehend it, must be experienced in Alchymy, for I cannot set it
down in such a way as is usual with the Apothecaries. Take Antimony changed or
reduced into very fine Alcool (here the desirous searcher of Truth is to know,
that the change or transmutation of the Antimony into Alcool, does not signify
grinding into fine powder, as according to the literal sense it does sound, but
the Antimony being heavy and compact of its Nature, must by art and by the
power of fire be forced to ascend in form of a very light dust, in so much that
not the least remain behind in the bottom pertaining to the substance of
Antimony; and this is to be repeated thrice, as our Philosopher in his
Marginals mentions, and left behind him for information, (although the same
may be also gathered from Paracels. lib. 3. cap. 6. de vita longa.) then
reverberate it in a close Reverberatory for the space of a Month, and it will
be Volatile, first white, then yellow, at last red and brown, very light and
spungy. Being red and reverberated sufficiently, take it out, and extract its
Essence Lili with spirit of Wine, which is to reach twenty inches over it (Here
Paracelsus plays again with the word Spiritus Vini, as he did in the process
of gold in the second chapter, whereof I made mention above in the ninth
chapter, in regard that the Spiritus Vini is far too weak to extract this
Tincture, but as in the process of Gold, so here the Sal circulatum is the
means, which must effect that solution and separation; as our Philosopher in
the now quoted place. 49. in dispensatorio novo mentioned, instead whereof the
Alcali Volatile may be used, in regard that they proceed from the same root and
ground, as I mentioned before) and the substance of the Antimony being in the
Spirit of Wine, decant it, and keep the Spirit of Wine so mixed together. This
is the highest purification of the whole Lili, also the noblest and most
commendable, which carries off all that is impure in Man, and moreover all
that Man can find within man. If you find out this Medicine and Arcanum, it
will not make you a supposed Physician, but a knowing one. In this manner is
the Sulphur Philosophorum or Medecina Vniversalis Antimonii prepared, and of
its great and wonderful virtues you may further read in the forementioned fifth
chapter of his Chirurgy.

Now although this way is so excellently good, that it cannot be amended, yet
it is very difficult, and one may easily miss in it, because of the
Reverberation, in which one may quickly be out and spoil all. And therefore I
will here set down an easier and readier way, to the end that the
Truth-desirous Reader may first try this, as being easier and surer, and so
afterward also imitate the other which is by Reverberation. Therefore take the
pure separated Sulphur Antimonii, done as taught in the second Chapter,
dissolve it with the Alcali Volatile, and cohobate it so long, until the Salt
rise like a Rubie, and you have a far shorter and surer way: But this Tincture
is not perfectly so virtuous as the former, made by Reverberation, which by the
fire has been brought to more maturity and perfection.

If any one please, he may also make an Essence of the Sulphur of Antimony in
such a manner, as even now has been mentioned, of the Sulphur Electri
immaturi; and this is then the true Balsamus Sulphuris for inward use, in
regard there is no difference in this at all, only there will be a difference
as to their Virtue.

CAP. XII.
That the Sulphur Philosophorum may also be made of Common Sulphur.
ALthough our Philosopher does not teach any thing concerning the preparation
of Common Sulphur, which arises to the excellency of the Sulphur
Philosophorum, yet for all that it is not excluded from thence: for though our
Philosopher in the place often quoted does specify by name only the Sulphur
Cupri, Glaurae, or Electri mineralis and Antimonii, yet he will among the rest
also have understood and comprehend the common Sulphur; in regard that he says
in genere. Hortor itaque tyrones, addiscant sulphura mineralium spoliare vi
peregrina ac Virulenta, sub cujus custodia abditur ignis vitalis, Archeum in
scopos desideratos placidissime deducens. Now that the common Sulphur is not
excluded, the highly experienced Paracelsus also does teach, relating the same
among those Arcana, viz. Gold, Pearl, Antimony, which are conducing to a long
Life, as it may be seen in his book of long Life, lib. 3. cap. 7. in which and
in many other places more he calls common Sulphur such a Balsome, which
preserves all things, and tingeth them with its tincture to perfection: and in
his book de transmutatione rerum naturalium, he says expressly, that common
Sulphur as well as Gold has power to tinge the body of Man into the highest
degree of health, whereof these are his words, worthy to be considered: the
Tincture of humane bodies, for to tinge them into their highest health, and
expel all diseases from thence, to recover all lost Virtues and colors, to
restore and renew are these, Gold Pearl, Antimony, Sulphur, Vitriol and the
like, etc. being prepared or brought into their Arcana, of whose preparations
we teach in other books at large, etc. The same and in like manner he teaches
also in his book de renovatione and restauratione, saying: the primum ens which
comes from Sulphur is so effectual in humano corpore, that it renews all the
radical humors with all their adherencies; and in the same book also he sets
down a process, so to dissolve and ripen Sulphur, as that it may be able to
effect such an universal purification, renovation and restoration of all lost
virtues and powers in the body of Man; consequently a Sulphur* Philosophorum
may also be made of common Sulphur, hence we will by no means pass it by, but
mention its preparation here also, because that of it as well as of the Sulphur
Cupri and Antimonii, an universal Medicine is to be made, yet each in its
degree and condition, into which it has been stated by Nature in its first
generation: for although the Tincture of Copper Universally cures, yet does it
not perform the same so gloriously and so eminently as the Tincture of the
Sulphur Metalli primi: so likewise comparing the Tincture of Antimony with that
of Copper, this latter is found far more excellent than the former; and so
further the case is still the same betwixt Antimony and common Sulphur, viz.
that the Tincture of the former does so far exceed the perfected Anima or
Essentia of the common Sulphur in splendor and shining Light, as nature in
their first Generation has more highly Nobilitated and Stated the former than
the latter; which nature it self does show forth, and experience teaches us;
and because this secret has not been discovered hitherto, I thought it
necessary to open it unto the Reader, that he may rightly apprehend the ground
thereof. For although the Sulphur Antimonii be as well Volatile and combustible
as the common Sulphur, and so no difference betwixt them as to their Fixity or
Maturity; for all that they are so much differenced as to their virtue, that
the Sulphur Antimonii, without any further preparation being given to the
patient, is of far greater, quicker and more powerful operation, than the
common Sulphur, though often sublimed; which proceeds from no other, but its
inbred excellency, wherewith it has been endowed by Nature; and so the Sulphur
Cupri has greater virtue, than that of Antimony, and so forth. But some may
say, that the Sulphur of Antimony being extracted and made visible by an
Alcali, has been corrected and meliorated by the fieriness of the fixed
Alcali, and thence is more excellent in virtue, but not by reason of its birth:
For answer, it is confessed, that the Sulphur Antimonii and all other Mineral
Sulphurs being for a long time united and boiled with a fiery Alcali (as the
same shall be faithfully demonstrated and taught afterward) indeed come forth
meliorated and amended; but in extracting of the Sulphur of Antimony, the
Alcali is but ground with the Antimony, water poured on, and in that moment
that the Alcali impregnated with the sulphur, does run through the filter, the
Acidum may be put in, and so the Alcali again severed from the sulphur. Now
what maturation or melioration can the sulphur of Antimony receive from the
Alcali in such a moment of time? which I leave to you to judge of: But put
case, that you could not acquiesce in this, know that there are yet other ways
to extract the sulphur, so that the Alcali do not touch the same, nor any other
thing do act upon it, and yet it does readily rise from the Antimony, as if you
put thereupon its Acetum, which will admit of no communion at all with the
sulphur, but presently associateth it self to the mercurial part of the
Antimony, and so the sulphur is set free from its Mercury, and therefore rises
in a very gentle heat, in color like other common sulphur, and not differenced
at all from the common, neither in color, smell, taste, volatility nor
combustibleness, only that it yields a fairer Light, being burnt, than the
common sulphur does being kindled, and yet notwithstanding that it is so like
unto common sulphur, and has not been touched nor extracted by any thing that
could have meliorated the same, but has been readily dismissed from its
Mercury, this having been satiated by some more acceptable thing, it surpasses
the common Sulphur for all that so much, that it is to be admired, that there
is such difference betwixt them, as to efficacy and virtue, which only
proceeds from their different natures, and that according to the first seed
of these Minerals Nature has bestowed a greater excellency upon the one than
upon the other; The same is also to be seen by our Philosophers Mechanica,
teaching, that we shall extract a sulphur from Antimony, such as to its outward
appearance does not differ from common sulphur, only that it is a little
greater, and then with Mercury to make a Cinnabrium of it, and sublime it seven
times, afterward take half an ounce of it, and let it hang into a barrel of
wine for xxiv. hours, whereof for some days a spoonful taken every day, will
be of so great effect, that it will be much wondered at, and that such a a
Philosophic Cinnabrium may without ending and diminishing of its virtue be
used for this purpose, being but sublimed again. Now try the same with common
sulphur, in case that you cannot apprehend or assent unto my former proof, and
you will find by experience, that you will effect nothing with it, but that the
great prerogative, and notable pre-eminency must be granted unto the Sulphur
Antimonii, by reason of its inbred, more excellent Virtues, which it has and
possesses according to its inbred nature, although in the outward show they be
very like to one another. And herein lies a great Mystery, and excellent
knowledge of the Metallic and Mineral Kingdom, which hitherto (for ought I
have read and heard) has been cleared and opened by none, and therefore shall
not be passed over with silence; For the nature of all Metallic and Mineral
Sulphurs is like unto the nature and condition of the Stars, yea the Mineral
Sulphurs are true and express images, forms and products of the Stars; for as
the Stars are fire and light, so likewise the Sulphurs; as those do warm and
lighten so these; and as those do quicken and can do no otherwise, but to raise
life, for they are altogether light and life, yea a source of quickening virtue,
so likewise the Sulphur can do* no other but do good and warm, lighten and make
alive*

But to the end that the desirous seeker of Truth may truly understand this
Mystery, and rightly apprehend my meaning, I do impart unto him according to my
knowledge, which God in his mercy has granted unto me, that all the Sulphura
of the whole Metallic and Mineral Kingdom, not one excepted, are created of
one substance, viz. of the grosser, thicker, earthy or lower fire, which is the
Mother and first rise of them all, and so are totally of one nature, of one
descent, and of one substance, even as the stars are of one and the same
substance, viz. created of the heavenly, that is of the subtler fire, and the
Nature, both of the Stars, and also of all the Sulphurs, consists chiefly in
two Virtues, in warming and lighting. Now as the Almighty hand of the great God
in the beginning created all stars of one matter and substance, viz. of a
subtle fiery Light, and yet from the first beginning of their creation made the
one more glorious, more powerful, and and more splendid than the other: So the
case is the same with the metallic and Mineral Sulphurs, which God also
created of one substance, viz. of a gross and earthy thick fiery Light; but
yet withal has framed the one more glorious, and far more virtuous than the
other, and so attributed unto each one its peculiar glory, which it cannot
exceed, though it be perfected, as much as is possible, in so much that no
Sulphur can take more virtue, than has been given unto it by the Creator in
its first original formation: And as you see that one star is much fairer and
brighter than the other, so likewise one Sulphur surpasses the other, as I
have clearly demonstrated, concerning the difference betwixt the Sulphur
Antimonii and the Common, that this latter cannot reach, nor be advanced unto
the glory and splendor in healing which the former has, though it be sublimed
never so often. And the same is also the condition of the Sulphur Antimonii
compared to the Sulphur Electri mineralis immaeturi, that although it is much
more glorious as to its concreated splendor than the Common Sulphur, yet can
it not attain to that height and excellency which the Sulphur Electri immaturi
has, viz. that by bare suspension from the neck it can suddenly loosen the
Witchcraft; no, such a glorious splendor it is not endowed withal; so that it
is sufficiently evident, that although these three be all combustible and
volatile, yet they are very unlike one another, only because of their first
generation, wherein each got its peculiar splendor, Power, light and virtue.
Now as you see further that among the stars the most glorious is the Sun, which
far surpasses all the other with its splendor, light and virtue; yea as the
highly illuminated Teutonicus Philosophus Jacob Bohme in his book de tribus
principiis, as also de signatura rerum, also de triplici vita, and others more,
according to his wisdom and profound knowledge granted unto him by the Spirit
of God, teaches, the Sun is the root, source, and heart of the Stars, whence
they all did flow, and so of right may be called, and is in truth the Father of
the Stars, in regard of their source, and a King of them, because of its great
pre-eminence in splendor: Even so in like manner the Metals and Minerals have
also their King and Father, which surpasses them all, and therefore is called
Metallus primus sive Masculus (which signifies as much as Pater metallorum) by
our highly guifted and profoundly learned Philosopher Helmont, as also by
Paracelsus, which have by Gods blessing acknowledged the same; yea seen
perfectly with the eyes of their understanding, that this Electum minerale has
the same relation to all the rest, which the Sun has to all other stars, and
so of right may be called the King of the Mineral Kingdom, in regard that this
proceeds from it, just as a tree springs from its root, and because that
its splendor and light is so excellent in its wholesome virtue and operation,
that none of all the Metals and Minerals can do the like, thefore its heavenly
Tincture is set down in the first place among all the great Arcani Paracelsi,
as on Philosopher does relate in his book and I have mentioned already in the
former chapter, as I have also shown a little before, how much it exceeds the
Sulphur of Antimony in splendor* which Sulphur yet is of so great efficacy,
that it is to be admired, as our Philosophers quoted words have mentioned, and
therefore also this Mineral King is called by our Philosopher, and Paracelsus,
the Quinta essentia of all members, because that nothing does so completely
strengthen all the Members as this Royal Tincture* hence also it is called by
them Simpliciter and secundum excellentiam Arcanum Tincturae, because that the
Tincture of life is especially and above all put into this Royal subject by
Nature, in which sense our Philosopher inter imperfectiora calls it, the
highest and most excellent of all the wonders of Nature, yea the greatest and
most effectual means for long Life, whereupon we most rely; ad vitam longam,
says he, solus apex and culmen spei; and mirabilium naturae culmen, which
commendation does not properly belong unto it, till it be brought into its
Arcanum, that is, till it be ripened, completely digested, and perfected, and
then it is the Sulphur Philosophorum above all other; and although the Sulphurs
of all the others be brought to the same maturity and fixation as the Sulphur
of the Electrum immaturum, yet those cannot show forth such an excellent
splendor and luster as this, because that each one presently from its first
generation carries its determinate height and glory along, which it is
impossible to exceed, it being contrary to the will of the Creator, by whose
Will all are made, and who would have it so, that such a Sulphur should light
in this, and such an other in an other glory, to the end that in this manner
the manifold Virtues and Lights (which otherwise would remain hidden) of the
heavenly substance, whereof these are the express stamp or print, and from
which these are flown, might be made manifest, and so man might wonder at the
great variety of those mighty and innumerable powers of Nature, and so be drawn
on to praise the great God as Creator of all these Lights. So that you hence
clearly see the great difference among the perfected Arcana, and that the name
of Sulphur Philosophorum belongs more to the one than to the other; also,
that each one has and may attain unto its of Nature determinated perfection,
and not higher; and therefore also the Common Sulphur (for whose sake we were
necessitated to make this ddinction) can but attain unto such a perfection, as
is attributed unto it by Nature, viz. which is not so excellent as that of the
rest, but in the lowest degree of all, and yet for all that yielding a true
Panacaea, as we have heard by Paracelsus his testimony, and shall now
understand further by the Mechanic Demonstration; for the obtaining whereof
you must know, that the common Sulphur is a simple or single substance, not
united with a Mercurial body as other Minerals are, but consisting of
altogether Similar parts, and being Similar all over; consequently needs no
purification, nor separation, but only this, that being altogether Volatile,
Unripe, Combustible, and partly Venomous, it be maturated, digested, and made
perfect, and in case that it had been mixed with heterogeneous things, that it
be sublimed once or twice first, and afterward digested till to its maturity.
And the Common Sulphur and its maturation is not unlike unto a piece of flesh
or meat, wherein is great virtue to satiate and comfort man, but being yet raw,
it must be first prepared by pertinent cooking, that it may impart its virtue
unto Man: Even so Sulphur though it be of a great Balsamic Virtue; yet it
contains also much of that, which is contrary and hurtful unto our nature,
wherewith so long as the Sulphur remains so, it does kill more than it can
quicken, as I have had the experience of its virulency in my own self, about
ten years ago, having then been thrown down by its stinking poison, that I was
like dead, and deprived of my interior and exterior senses for a whole hour,
whereof I was freed and restored again by an Antidote prepared of the self
same. And therefore its virulency ought to be removed or rather maturated and
perfected by digestion; For such Venom and death must not be taken away or
separated from the Sulphur, but perfected and introverted or shut up in death;
on the other side the internal hidden Light and Splendor is to be turned
outward, as our Philosopher says: Sub Veneni seu Virulentiae custodia abditur
ignis Vitalis, Archeum in scopos desideratos placidissime deducens. Now this
maturation and perfecting by digestion, is to be done in the same way, as a
piece of flesh is cooked that is enough, viz. only by the heat and power of the
Fire, and it is not necessary, but rather very hurtful, to use heterogeneous
corrosive Waters for this purpose, as the Chymick Writers in their Tyrocinia,
Comments, Processes, and many other sort of Books do perversely teach, for such
corrosive things do pervert and spoil the Sulphur so, that it gets another
nature; for if without addition of such corrosives it be cooked only by the
Fire, it then retains its natural, balsamic, softning and mollifying moisture,
wherewith it ought to enlighten outwardly, but the same is taken away from it
by addition of acid and corrosive waters, for they penetrate thereinto, and
make it harsh, and quite other than it was created by bounteous nature: and
although they do think, that by this way they may the sooner finish their work,
which also they do, yet they do not consider the great hurt they do, that by
such Heterogeneous and contrary things they do quite alter, pervert and spoil
its Nature; Therefore follow Nature, whose operations are all simple and plain,
preserving every thing in its innate condition, which you may evidently see in
all Metals, yea in the Gold it self, which in its first original generation as
to its Anima, was a true combustible Sulphur, how Nature preserved this Sulphur
so carefully in its fusibleness, that although it has been brought to the
highest fixation, yet still has kept its original fusibleness. But by what
means has Nature performed the same? barely and only by the Fire contained in
its inmost bosom, and made not use of corrosive sharp waters, as the whole
crew the common writers teach now a days, but cooked the same in a simple
plain way, by heat so long, till it came to be perfect and fixed, as also all
Paracelsus processes tending to this Arcanum Sulphuris are wholly consonant to
this foresaid way of Nature. So we must do in like manner, follow Nature, and
consider well how it works, and not invent such strange ways, whereby we
work differently from, and contrary unto Nature, and so produce clean other
fruit, than Nature does. Intending therefore to perfect the common Sulphur
which is fufile and simple of its nature, so as it may be consonant unto the
proceeding of Nature; put it in a phiol, having first been sublimed once or
twice before, and digest it only of it self by such a fire as its nature
requires, until it do ascend no more, nor is combustible, but wholly fixed
and perfected; which though* it require a long time, and constant, and good
looking to, that it has no more heat than is necessary: but on the other side
it is a plain and simple way, which needs no other preparation costly
Menstrua, and the like, but may be done barely and only by fire, and such is
the proceeding of Nature with Metals under ground, and no other. But in regard
that this work is of a long lasting, and requires much time, to the end
therefore, that in the mean time you may not be weary nor dubious, whither the
Sulphur will come at length to perfection, I will lay you down a plain and
convincing demonstration, that you may be assured of the perfection to come,
and so hold on in your work and finish it. Take therefore some of your Sulphur,
so digested for some weeks, dissolve it in oil, dissolve also some of such
Sulphur (as it was in the beginning before digestion) in Oil, and you will find
that the latter solution stinketh horribly, but the other smells very
Aromatically, in Testimony, that part of the Venom (from whence as from a root
the horrible stench does flow) is ripened and changed; which you will also know
by the great Virtue, which this already for some weeks ripened Sulphur will
show forth beyond all other common flores Sulphuris; and therefore cheerfully
go on, until it be quite fixed, and be not wearied by the length of time, but
remember the end, that it will prove joyful for you, and bring unto you such a
Noble Treasure of health, and yet does cost you no more, but only a few Coals,
and careful looking to the fire.

Now although this manner of proceeding be quite consonant unto that which
Nature it self uses, in regard that the same also simply and plainly by its
fire does perfectly digest the Minerals and Metals, translating them from
Volatility into the greatest fixity, and that in this manner you have rightly
worked according to Nature: yet this does not hinder, that there may be not a
better and shorter way to attain thereunto, in regard that by this, Art is
distinguished from Nature, yea this is, and is properly called art, which
begins where Nature cease, and knows how to amend and meliorate that
which Nature works, which flows from the understanding and Wisdom of Men,
which has been communicated by the unsearchable Wisdom of God unto the
Children of Men, all which, as well those which are of the least account with
us, as also your high and great works of Art, are nothing else but printed
Images, of the Infinite, Innumerable, Unsearchable Powers and Wisdom of God,
which the Man which considers those Wonders cannot sufficiently admire, and
praise his God and Creator, as holy David also says very excellently Ps. 111.
The works of the Lord are great, he that regards them, has his* pleasure
altogether in them: but he that does not regard them, that is, does not look
upon them as a Man of sound reason, pondering whence those wonderful Arts, and
manifold Wisdom of God proceeds or flows, is like a beast, which only
enjoyes those glorious things, and makes use of them, but is not thereby as by
a guide lead or carried up to the Creator, who is the source of all those
manifold gifts. Now if we sharpen our understanding and consider, whither this
former way, which is so consonant unto Nature, cannot be amended or
abbreviated; presently there offers it self the daily practice of the Cooks,
which though according to the simple and plain way of Nature they can ripen and
roast their flesh only by the bare fire, insomuch that a Man may enjoy it, and
refresh himself therewith, without any more ado; yet according to Arts
invention, which plays and stirs in them like a source, they use means for to
advance this maturation, or cooking of the flesh, that it may be the sooner
ready; viz. laying the flesh in Vinegar for some weeks, the Vinegar does so
prepare it, that they need not half the time for the making of it ready, which
they should have needed, if it had not lain in the Vinegar; Let us therefore
see, whither there be not also a Liquor in the Chemical Kitchen and Shop,
whereby the sulphur may be first marinated or pickled, and so fitted for the
following perfect fixation, such a Liquor can be none of the sour Corrosive
spirits, in regard that these have no affinity with sulphur, and so not only
are not able to mollify the same, but also as being its enemies, do alter the
same in its imbred mollfying virtue, and do pervert and spoil it, and so
deprive it of its natural connate treasure. Now in the preparation of the
Sulphur this must be aimed at, that it be preserved and amended in its former
natural endowment, but not corrupted and perverted into a strange harsh
substance, which is totally unlike to its Original. And therefore we must
leave all Acida and Corrosiva, if we mean to hit the the mark we aimed at, and
thus to prepare the Sulphur, that it may remain in its first nature and
quality; but such a moisture as is for our turn we may get best from such
things, which as to their ground stand upon the same root with the Sulphur, and
so are of the same, that is of a fiery nature; and such are the fixed Alcalies,
which by virtue of their fiery burning and ripening nature can so prepare the
Sulphur that the following work afterward falls out much easier and shorter:
And this may be done two several ways: first by boiling the Sulphur with a
very fiery Alcali in water for a long time, and you must herein look to the
ground, and well consider, what serves your turn, the fieryer your Alcali is,
the more speedily your preparation will be ended, and therefore be diligent to
make very fiery Alcalies and to exalt them in their fierinesse to the highest,
to which end Mars will readily yield you its fiery salt; In such and the like
fiery Alcali boil your Sulphur, the longer the better, as you will see by
experience, that the longer you macerate it thus, the more power it will show
in Physic already, before its perfect and final fixation. Having prepared it
sufficiently thus, precipitate the same then with an Acidum, and you will have
such an excellent prepared Sulphur, as you could not have imagined before;
witness the Lac Sulphuris of the common Chemical Authors, which is but once
dissolved with the Alcali, and presently precipitated, and yet by this small
boiling gets such an exalted power from the fierynesse of the Alcali, that it
is of far greater virtue than before it was boiled therewith, and the
sluggishness and simpleness of the common Chemists is much to be wondered at,
that none hitherto was found amongst them, which has considered of this
foundation, nor begun to argue, if the Sulphur in so short a time, by a small
boiling, has got such a great amendment, insomuch that it becomes far nobler
and far more powerful than it was before, it must then follow, that if we
should boil it thus for a long time, as also, if we should exalt our Alcali in
its fierinesse that we should also exalt our Sulphur much higher in its virtue;
But there has been none hitherto which thought of it, but they rested
themselves content with their Lac Sulphuris, and so the one said it, and writ
it after the other, and so they sung still the same song: And this is truly the
modern, much lamentable case of the noble Chymiatria, that the most part of
the Chemists (as not only their books, but also their daily practice
witnesses), most of them advancing no higher, nor knowing any more, but what
they find written in books, which also many times falls difficult enough for
them to imitate) are so deeply darkened in their understanding, that they do not
consider of those thing, which they work upon, of what nature they be, whence
they have their rise, how and in what manner, and by what power those things
which they deal in, do exert their Virtue and Power, and how the one does act
into the other, and can either mend or mar it, such thoughts never enter into
their brains, but only, make this so, and the other thus, mix this with such a
thing, and that with the other, and so forth without end, and when one does not
succeed, then another process is taken in hand, and so they are right
process-mongers, and children in understanding, which know not Themselves what
they work, but see with other eyes, viz. those of the process; if that be
silent, then they know no more, neither know to add, nor detract, neither to
amend nor to alter, and yet such fellows will be counted no less then great
Philosophi and Lumina mundi Chymici; all which proceeds from this cause, that
the Mind in which (as in his Image) God should play with his out-flowing Wisdom
and pour into it the treasures of his eternity, is grossly darkened and
obumbrated with earthy muck and nastinesse, wi^h hoggish desires of earthly and
corrupttible things, with Diabolical pride, covetousness, ambition pleasure of
the flesh, and with an ^msatiable desire of the earthly corruptible good, which
is but only a shadow which vanishes under ones hands; with such fair images
their Mind is quite filled up and totally obumbrated; such desires they serve
unto with an unsatiable hunger, as their lives do testify. Now how should the
wisdom of God pour out it self into such a nasty hogst^y, replenisht with
earthly husks, and adorn the same with his gifts, and impresse his Images
there, in regard that their heart is already before within and without wholly
laid and painted over with such horrible and abominable figures of proud
Peacocks, covetous hogs, earthly dogs, carnal bulls, etc. God, to whom we make
our moan, will know how to judge those fatted swine, and to put in the room of
them faithful workmen which desire to seek and to love nothing else but God,
the only and highest good, and in his love, which he pours forth into their
hearts, do also heartily love their neighbor as their fellow-brother,
liberally and joyfully sharing their received gift with him, but of this enough
at this time.

Now to return unto our preparation of the Sulphur, viz. to the second way,
which is not distinguished from the first, as to the ground and substance, but
only differs as to the manner of proceeding; for here the fiery Alcali is not
by Water united with the Sulphur, but only of it self through-dry, and so put
together well closed in a gentle heat, and kept there so, that the Sulphur do
not rise: but in case it should happen, it being not well possible to observe
it so accurately, but that some do rise, you must mix that which is risen again
with the Alcali; for all that which is without or above the Alcali cannot
receive its preparation; and there remains nothing more to be given notice
here, but as to all the rest, it is like unto the first way; for the longer you
cement your Sulphur thus, the excellenter, and the readier or fitter it is for
the ensuing fixation: which for to sever afterward you must dissolve the same
together with the Alcali in Water, and precipitate it again; Now you may choose
either of these ways, which you like best; and know for your information that
though this latter be better than the former, yet it is more laborious, and the
other far easier, and therefore make choice of that which is most for your
convenience. As concerning this so prepared Sulphur, experience will make it
known to you, what excellent Virtues it has, notwithstanding that it has not
received yet its ultimate fixity and perfection. If you please you may proceed
so with all Minerals, that have a combustible, Volatile, easily separable
Sulphur, using water to it after the first way. As for example, Antimony thus
dealt with and corrected, yeildeth a very precious Sulphur in Physic and
Chirurgy; but this you must be advertised of, that having boiled your Antimony
sufficiently with the Alcali according to your desire, then let it cool, and
pour a great quantity of cold Water to it, the more the better, and the gross
Mercurial substance, which by the fierynesse of the Alcali was dissolved with
the rest, will for the most part sever it self from the Laxivium, and so let it
rest for a day or two; then filter it, and the Antimony remaining in the filter
will be very spongious and pufft up, ten times bigger then it was before; as to
its corporeousnesse or bulk; rince the same often by pouring on of Water upon
it, that no saltinesse remain with it, and so keep it for use in Chirurgy, it
being far better than all other flores Antimonii, in regard that it has
received a main correction from the Alcali, and its strong power of fierinesse.
But that which is run through the filter, precipitate with an Acidum, but
observe this difference, that you keep that which falls first and is red by
it self; and when it begins to sink down of an Orange or Lemon color, keep
this also by it self, precipitating the same in another Vessel by it self, the
which falling last of all keep for inward Medicine: but the first red for
Chirurgie, which is far more Virtuous, than the first undissolved red
Antimony, which contains but very little of Sulphur, but this very much. But
that we may not digress too far from our mark, we must turn again to our
Sulphur, which in its natural Water or Fiery moisture we have prepared and
fitted for the ensuing perfect Fixation: proceed with the same afterward, as
you did with the first crude Sulphur, and digest it till to its Final fixation,
whereunto you will attain far sooner than before, and use it afterward for
your prof^t and delectation in the wonders of bounteous nature.

Now although this also be a way of Maturation according to Nature, and far
shorter and more convenient than the first, yet the truth desirous Heart does
not rest in this, but searches and inquireth further, whither it be not
possible for Art to perform this perfection, and perfect maturation after a
better way yet? and whither it cannot be advanced yet to a higher perfection?
which enquiry is occasioned by the now-mentioned Correction or Melioration,
done by the Alcalia, which although they be but gross Bodies, yet by reason of
their fieriness show forth such a strong force upon the Sulphurs, how much more
then might they effect, if they were first made spiritual, and afterward
joined unto the Sulphur; And this conclusion is very right and grounded in the
powers of Nature, and this correction does perfectly resemble unto the
seasoning of Meat, for although one may very well eat meat, dressed of it self
alone without all spice, and thereby redintegrate his diminished Vigor of
Life; yet if it be seasoned with warming spices (all which are of a warming and
strengthening Nature) and so prepared, and reduced to a better perfection, then
they strengthen man much more, and impart more comfort unto him: Even so the
case stands in truth with the fixed Sulphur, which of it self alone maturated
and digested into perfection is sufficient to strengthen diseased Nature: but
if a warming Philosophic Aroma be joined thereunto, and it be digested
therewith so, that this Aroma remains unseparated with the Sulphur, as
ordinary spice remains with the Meat, and is enjoyed together with it, it
must needs follow, that such a seasoned fixed sulphur is much more effectual in
its operation, than if of it self alone it be maturated into perfection, the
truth whereof experience will make good unto the desirous seeker of truth. Now
to effect this, take your sulphur prepared by the fiery Alcalies, and dissolve
the same in a spiritual and Volatilised Alcali, afterward by a very gentle
fire abstract your fiery water so long, till you see that by such a gentle
degree of fire no clear or white Liquor more will come over, and there will
remain a thick, very red, spiritual, penetrative juice or Liquor, retaining so
much of this hot Aroma, as is needful for the seasoning of this solar fruit;
now this same digest and maturate with judgment and discretion, that your
Aroma be not forced from it, but remain unseparably therewith, and together
with the Sulphur turn at length into a fixed and perfect Elixir; you must take
heed, that you forget not exactly to govern the degrees of the Fire, that you
may not overhasten not spoil the work, until both have attained unto complete
fixation, whereof you will have more cause to rejoice, than of the former
simple maturation. And although I could instruct you of more far higher
perfections, and more effectually pertaining to sulphur, yet I shall now
subsist in what has been related, till some time to come (if the highest God
permit)! Now this fixed Sulphur, as by Nature it was a burning fire and shining
light; so now it is an incumbustible, not externally but internally warming and
cherishing fire; and as before it burnt up all combustible things, so now by
its might it burns up invisible diseases, consuming them like as fire does
straw: and as the Sulphura before their maturation did lighten only externally,
so now they lighten to the spirits of darkness, viz. the diseases, all which
are nothing else but Spirits or properties of the dark chamber of death* and
forerunners of the dark death (as the same could be demonstrated through the
whole body of Physic and Pathology) so expelling them, that is, transmuting
them into good spirits, as they were before when the Man had his health; so
these perfected mineral sulphurs are like unto the sun, which lights,
warmeth, and raises that which is dead into Life; which the fixed Sulphurs,
according to all their (by the Excellency of Art) raised and obtained
properties do effectually perform. But this is not to be understood, as if
nothing else at all may be administered unto the sick, save only this perfected
universal Medicine, no, this is not the meaning; in regard that this and any
other like Panacaea relate only to the source of the disease, which always
rises from some quality or property of darkness, this is the thing which such
a power of light, viz. the abovementioned Tinctures of Gold, Copper, Antimony
and the like does transmute, reducing, the infected Archeus into that State
again, which it was in before, when the Man had his health; but if in the mean
time such a sickly spirit or dark property has effected or produced something
that is material, it is not denied, but that then there may be used also other
as well internal as external proper means to expel, consume and remove that
productum; Much less are excluded those needful Manuals, in Ulcers, Luxations,
Fractures, Wounds, and the like, as every one that will but make use of his
understanding may easily perceive; as also, that though there be Universal
Medicines at hand, there must for all that good heed be taken, and judgment
and discretion be used; which admonition I deemed very necessary, because that
the Enemies of truth jeer at the like Arcana, and use to deride them,
pretending, that thus the Vegetabilia, Anima, Lia, etc. had been created in
Vain, for that the word Panacaea does exclude all other means: but in this
sense it was never spoken or understood by the Philosophers, but their meaning
is only this, that by such Panacaea's only the root of the disease is
eradicated, and as it were cut off with a knife, and that the same is also to
be helped forward by other convenient Medecines, removing those Symptoms and
products, which by that source were brought forth. Also it is to be known, that
the Duelech or stone in Man is excluded from the like Panacaea's, especially
that, which has its rise and seat in the bladder, as our Philosopher does
faithfully admonish, and among other places in Ignoto hydrope. 49. expressly
mentions, that the Rise of the stone in the bladder is quite otherwise, than
of other diseases, which are all such spirits, or qualities as are spoiled,
infected and darkened, and they perform also their operation in the body of Man
like raging, stinging, painful powers of darkness; but concerning the stone,
as its first rise is Material, so its operation or forth flowing incommodation
is material, viz. that such a material, rough, sharp substance lies in such a
tender very sensible place, which cannot suffer nor bear any Heterogeneous
harsh things; and so hurts Man more by its quantity than quality, in regard
that its cure effected by cutting does clearly testify, that as soon as the
body or material substance of the stone is taken away from the bladder, that
presently then all pain, disease, and discomodation, occasioned by the stone,
is taken away, so that no man should be necessitated to dye of the stone, if
the cut could be done in such sort, that the other parts of the body of man
might not be spoiled and inflamed by the unnatural force of the cut, which is
nothing else but a violent rent of that, which Nature would have and keep whole
and entire. So the Stone is a cause of the disease, yea of death it self, not
as a working spirit, but as an obstructing material substance, and therefore
also the Arcana can do no help in this case; for though they can pacify and
quiet the enraged Archeus, yet this pacification is of no long lasting, by
reason that the cause of disquiet or pain is still present, raising still again
new anguish and pain: Consequently such a medicine for to cure the stone must
be had, which is able to liquefie, dissolve, mollyfie and reduce into dust that
gross, hard body of the stone, that the same afterward may be carried forth
by Urine; but because the Arcana have not that power, yea cannot come with
their substance to the place where the stone lies, but their power and virtue
consists only in the property of light, therefore the stone of the bladder is
excluded, and their great power of Light cannot reduce unto dust its hard gross
material body, that it might be carried forth; for which end other means are
requisite, whereof our Philosopher has written a peculiar book, which may be
perused abut this matter.

This is the whole ground of the Sulphur Philosophorum, according to the
doctrine of our faithful Philosopher, which he left us in his writings but very
darkly and hiddenly, which I have opened and denudated unto the desirous lover
of truth, yea so clearly presented unto his eyes, as one sees his one face in
a looking-glass; For as the face appearing in the looking glass, resembles
unto the true substance of the face standing before the glass thoroughly: So you
have here a complete draught representing the true substance of the Tincture of
Health, what shape it has, and how it explicateth it self from the beginning
to the end: But as the shadow is not the substance it self, also the face
appearing in the looking glass is far distant from the excellency of the
substantial face; Even so the case stands with this Mystery of the Sulphur
Pholosoporum manested clearly by me, which although it be opened by me in all
its parts in such sort, as that nothing is wanting which is requisite to
express the substance, but all is represented in its lively colors in all
points; yet notwithstanding the substance of this pictured and represented
Mystery will not be obtained, nor effected with such ease, as it is understood
and apprehended; and peradventure many a one, especially such as hereby aims
at, and seeks but himself, and the pleasure of his flesh, will be constrained
to content himself only with the here pictured shadow, and never to enjoy the
substance; And this only therefore, because he fancieth to himself, that
because that all is opened fundamentally and clearly, he may therewith with
unwashen hands, as his own will and pleasure, rush in upon these Arcana, and
elaborate the same according to his own rational conceptions, conclusions,
consequences and Inductions, as it is usual with the Modern Chemists, to work
at randum, conceiving that by their imaginary cunningnesse they may catch the
Arcana, and as Lords proprietors possess them; hence those Men do continually
eagerly lay wait for prescribed processes, like as the Wolf waits for the
sheep, of which opinion there will not be a few, that the ground of this great
Mystery being so openly cleared by me, they will lift up themselves in their
mind and think; this shall not fail me, this must not escape from my hands, but
that I will finish it, and bring the same to a happy issue, to the end that
afterward they may the better vaunt it, and exalt themselves in their
haughtiness, with the mysteries of God and Nature, and like a proud peacock
burst forth and triumph over the poor and distressed, like lustful Stallions:
But all this will fail, and let none fancy, that he may obtain this mystery in
such a way, for God holds his hand upon it, who will bless with an happy
issue the labors of those only, which he knows that they seek only the glory
of his name, and the hearty love of their neighbor, and nothing else; who in
reality and truth show forth by their life and conversation that with King
David in the 119. Psalm. v. 127. They love the Commandments of God above fine
gold* and with King Solomon, Prove. 8. v. 10. Receive instruction and not
silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold: for that wisdom to them is better
than Rubies, and all the things that may be desired, are not to be compared to
it. Such may be confident of a good end, and none else, as our Philosopher de
Febribus witnesses, cap. 4.. 9. Paucis absolvi secretum quod medicum
nobilitat, at istud parasse pro prima vice, est ingentis operae, pendetque ejus
directio a manu ejus, cui debetur omnis honos, quia parvulis revelat ejusmodi
Arcana, quae mundus nescit, id idcirco vilipendit, And each hungry
processe-monger will find it by experience to be true, what our Philosopher
here says, that it is a work of great moment, and truly no childrens sport,
nor common slabbering work, as now a days they work; such a one will find it
presently in the beginning, when he goes about to prepare the double spirits,
there he will see, that all he has learned and practiced for so many years
will be of little use or help in that work. But now to the end that the true
desirous seekers of truth may be entered into the track, how to begin, and
happily end this work, I will set down unto them my way which I went my self,
and whereby I obtained it, which is but of a small compass, viz. that all that
is to be worked upon in Chymia, be first thoroughly considered, and sifted out
according to its whole nature, before it be brought to the fire, viz. from what
power or property the subjectum (taken in hand to work upon) is flown or
proceeded forth, in what quality it does stand, what its operation is toward
other subjects, and wherein its in most power and efficacy or the inner Kernel
does properly consist; else if you wave this and work but on according to the
letter, you will not only get nothing, but are neither chosen of God, nor born
of nature for it; for God gives unto all those which he has chosen for his
Laborers in the Vineyard of Nature such a mind, that they deeply consider
those things which they have in hand, and draw the understanding of things out
of the inmost Ground of those things which they go about, as you have an
excellent pattern of such a seeker in our Philosopher; how deeply does he
search out those things whereof he treats, how accurately he sets down the
qualities of those subjects whereof he left the truth after him? such a mind
and such a humor befitteth every seeker of truth: you must seek the truth in
the inmost center of every subject, wherein you intend to work, but not in any
book, or from man: For instruction you may receive by books or good Friends,
but the substance and power you must gather from the things themselves, which
you have in hand; and this way I went, as I mentioned in the very beginning of
this Treatise, that when I found not the truth with men, that I applied my self
to fundamental and deep considerations of those things which I would take in
hand, and so at length discovered the truth.

But such a deep and fundamental consideration, or rather inspection of
natural, things does not consist (as most Readers may think) in penetrating
with your understanding into the substance or internal center of a subject, and
forcing as it were of the knowledge of its internal powers outward into your
understanding; No, this is not the right Way, but is the custom of perverted
foolish reason; but thus it is, that when your mind is first inflamed with a
desire of knowing the inmost power and virtue of this or that subject, only for
the glory and praise of the Creator, and unfeigned love of the neighbor, and
yet finding no power in your self, whereby of your own strength to search it
out, and to know it, you must then with your mind and desire enter into the
internal ground, out of which as well your mind, as also the subject, which you
desire to know, did flow forth, viz. to the creator which is highly blessed
above all, and in your desire carry your subject which you desire to know
before him, and humbly pray him, that thy self being blind and ignorant of it,
but your subject, as his Creature, with all its power, quality and virtue being
flown out of him, that he would vouchsafe to explicate the virtue of your
subject in your mind, and so to float it as it were into your hungry desires;
whereupon it will happen, that such a quality as rules in your subject will
perfectly rise in your mind, and you will see, feel, and substantially perceive
in your mind the reflection of that virtue which bears rule in your desired
subject, and so you will get a very true and most certain knowledge, not
consisting in opinion, but in the true substance: Now to this way of
consideration and inquiry into Nature, and is natural bodies I have been lead
(as I told you in the beginning of this Treatise) by our Philosopher in his
book called Venatio scientiarum, which imitate you as I have done, and you will
not fail to come to the truth, for faithful is he and there is no falsenesse
in him, which created all things by his Word, and in whom all things are
grounded, like a tree with its root in the Earth, which also most lovingly
calls us to himself, saying, Ask but and you shall receive, for what Father
is there among you, that will give a Serpent unto his Child, asking him for
bread, how much more then shall I your Heavenly Father give you all good
things, if you do pray me for it. And that you may the better attain thereunto,
and rightly, properly and experimentally know how to walk in this way, and what
you may expect, I will set down out of our Philosopher some Rules full of
Doctrine, which most of all set me in the right way, pointing out unto me, as
it were with fingers the right path: Read therefore very considerately, what
our Philosopher says in the now-mentioned book,. 32. 33. scivi exinde,
Rationem non habitare penes intellectum verum, sed extra eundem; eo quod in
intellectu immediate sit veritas: quia veritas intellecta nihil est aliud quam
adaequatio intellectus ad res ipsas. Cognoscit nempe intellectus res prout
sunt, ideoque vicissim verificatur intellectus de rebus ipsis per res ipsas;
Quandoquidem esse rerum de se est semper verum; and essentia illarum est
ipsamet veritas, adeoque intellectus qui super eas fertur, semper direct est
verus. Sed cum imaginatio, ejusve ratio, sit modus quidam intelligendi
obliquus, procedens per rations and discursus, non autem per adaequationis
transformationem, idcirco modus iste rationalis, est intellectus abusivus and
fallax; Bonum autem, rectum, unum and verum semper uno and eodem modo se habent
in intellectu, quia in intellectu stant in puncto adaequationis, sed malum,
curvum, obliquum, falsum atque multiplex fiunt pluribus modis, per rationem in
part imaginativa. Certo itaque cognovi, Rationem in non tam sublimi pretio
habendam ac fuit hactenus, magisque, quod in brutis, ratio and discursus, non
obscure vigerent, nam quod annosa vulpes, callidior sit juniore, per discursum
rationalem experientae reminiscentia confirmatum, accidit. Imo apes, numerant.
And. 45. Agnovi valedicendum rationi and imaginationi, tanquam, facultatibus
brutalibus, si ad solidam veritatis cognitionem spe trahamur in profundum,
cognovi pariter quod requireretur facilis traductio intellectus atque
transmutatio placida sui ipsius, in formam rei intelligibilis; quo puncto
scilicet intellectus pro momento, fiat velut ipsum intelligibile. Cum autem
intellectus perficiatur intelligendo, nihilque perficiatur, nisi ab eo quod
symbolum secum habet in sui natura, idcirco collegi, intellectum and intellecta
ut talia, debere esse aut fieri ejusdem naturae, debere autem hoc fieri extra
laborem, inquietudinem; sed cum otio in lumine sibi proprio cum abstractione,
orbatione and carentia alterius, cujuscunque auxilii Creati. And. 50. Istud
Lumen sive sit prorsus supernaturale, sive quod intellectus sui natura sic
accendatur, malim experiri, quam determinare; istud unicum saltem scio, quod
non contingat absque gratia. Quamobrem, sive intellectus transformetur, sive se
ipsum transformet in simulacrum rei intellectae, sane divino auxilio opus
habet, and quidem singulari, quia saltem tunc anima intuetur suum intellectum
sub forma arrepta in dicto lumine: atque in isto sui speculo, speculatur se
ipsam intellectualiter, absque reflexione alteritatis, sicque concipit rem
scibilem, una cum omni suo esse and proprietatibus, eo quod hoc cognitionis
Lumen non sit emanativum extra intellectum, sed manet intus reflexum, super
intellectum in omni veritate and certitudine perfecta, perfectivum. And. 55.
56. 57. Ispa rei intelligibilitas, est nisi adventus and approximatio unitatis,
intellectus and intellecti, etc. quod ut clarius exemplo fiat; intelligens
intellectus non est diversus ab intellecto, aliter, quam sicut radius lucis
directus, a se ipso reflexo; itaque rei intellectae essentia in lumine
intellectus, fit splendour spiritualis and essentialis, imo fit per
commigrationem ad unitatem, quodammodo ipsum lumen intellectuale, id quod
animabus brutorum advenire nequit. Ideo etiam anima nostra, se ipsam
intelligens, quod ammodo intelligit omnia alia, utpote universa alia sunt
intellectuali modo in anima, ut in Dei imagine, etc. idcirco, quantum anima
intellectualiter intilligit sui, in tantum proficit in cognitione utilissima,
quae de Creatis in hac vita haberi possit; quia in lumine sui luminis
quodammodo intuetur omnium proprietates, essentias, effectus, alteritates,
distinctiones atque defectus. Quo igitur semel appulit ista cognitio, ibidem
flaccescit omnis Rationis nubilior speculatio and subsidium, prout vice versa,
supprimitur verus intellectus sub rationis placitis. And. 60. Ostendi sat
alias, in tota natura Aristotelis doctrinam inanem, merasque nugas, quanto ergo
minus ille subsisteret in area intellectus? Cujus esse and operari pendent ex
sola anima. Cogimur namque Christiani credere, quod intellectus noster sit
spiritus immortalis, lumen and imago Omnipotentis, cujus exordium ut superat
naturam, itae ejus regulis aptari nequit, cum habeat esse simplicissimum, tum
etiam quod dep^ndeat immediate, totaliter and continuo a suo originali typo,
adeoque ut sine gratia particulari nequeat quicquam intelligere, eo quod
intellectus objectum sit ipsa veritas, quare nec intelligit intellectione
perfecta, nisi recipiendo, quod autem tantum recipit id patitur, non autem in
eo agit, nec enim intellectui proprium illud est, quod per gratiam illi
advenit, quippe intellectus tantum illuminative intelligendo patitur, est
namque molestius, servilius and obscurius, intelligendo operari quam pati, eo
quod patiendo recipiat lumen nobilius grates collatum. Denique cum intelligendo
transmigret semper in formam rei intellectae ergo participans de lumine
interminato perficitur absque taedio, molestia and labor intelligendi,
LVCETQVE INTELLECTVM LVMEN, INTELLIGENDO, INTELLECTVS LVMINE, SIC VT RES
IPSAENOS ALLOQVI VIDEANTVR SINE VERBIS, EASQVE PENETRAT INTELLECTVS CLAVSAS,
NON SECVS AC SI DISSECTAE ESSENT ET APERTAE. Ergo semper perficitur intellectus
patiendo, recipiendoque. And. 63. Ego credo imprimis, nil ad veritatis
cognitionem pertingere, nisi fidem and intellectum. 2. Omnem veritatem emanare
ex veritate unica, ideoque primitiva. 3. Omnen intellectum ex unico infinitoque
intellectu derivare. 4. Prout omne lumen ex unico lumine. 5. Veritatis ideo
essentiam nil discrepare ab essentia intellectus. 6. Quod intellectus noster
sit inanis, Vacuus, pauper and obscurus. 7. Quod omnis ejus claritas,
nobilitas, plenitudo, lumen veritasque illi adveniant recipiendo and patiendo.
8. Quod eo plus nobilititur quo plus patitur a lumine, quod est supra omnem
naturam.

Now if the Desirous seeker of Truth shall follow this information, and
Practice it, he will find Experimentally that there is no other way to know the
Truth of Natural Virtues, but by introverting the senses inwards into the
Center of the soul, where God dwells, who being in a Child-like way prayed
unto for Wisdom and Understanding, cannot possibly forbear, to Communicate
himself as the Highest Good, richly, with all his gifts unto his poor
Creature, which I heartily wish both unto my self and the Christian Reader, to
whom I commend also that Golden book of the Soul of Man, Chapter 12. of the
Teutonick Philosopher Jacob Bohmen, where He will find further and clearer
instruction concerning this; as also in his Letters which are Printed;
Concluding with the last Words of our Philosopher in his book de Lithiasi,
MEDECINA EST DONVM DEI, HIC AVTEM DONA SVA SVBTRAHIT LVCRO INTENTIS, NEC SEMEL
COGITANTIBVS DE MANDATO, ESTOTE MISERICORDES, SICVT PATER VESTER QVI EST IN
COELIS, MISERICORS EST, A QVO OMNE DONVM BONVM ET LVMINOSVM DESCENDIT. Take
this to heart you Physicians, and you will have a merciful God here, and at
your death carry with you the treasure of a good concience, and Eternally
Rejoice in those Wonders of Nature, wrought by you here.

Psalm. 97. 11. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
in heart.

FINIS.
The only way to attain unto true Wisdom is showed unto us by our faithful
teacher JESUS CHRIST in these following words.
Ask and it shall be given you: Seek and you shall find: Knock and it shall be
opened unto you.

For

Every one that asks receives: and he that seeks finds: and to him that
knocks, it shall be opened.

Or

What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

If then

Ye being evil know to give good how gifts unto your children, how much more
shall your Father which is in heaven give good things unto them that ask him?

Therefore

All things whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.

Matt. 7. v. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
