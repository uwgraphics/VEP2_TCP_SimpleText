Favorits.

Printed, Anno Dom. 1641.



The most excellent Princes Elizabeth Queen of England, France, and Ireland,
Defendor of the Faith etc. She reigned 44 years. died the 24 of March, 1602
aged 69, 6 months: and lies buried at Westminster. Compton Holland excudit.

FRAGMENTA REGALIA, OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE LATE QUEEN ELIZABETH, Her Times and
Favorites.
TO take herein the original, (...) was daughter to Henry the eighth, by Anne
Bull^^ (...) second of six Wives, which He had, and one of the Maids of Honor
to the divorced Queen Katherine of Austria (or as they now style it) ^nfanta of
Spain, and from thence taken into the Royal Bed.

That She was not of a most noble and Royal extract by Her Father, will not
fall into question, for on that side there was disimbogned into (...) ^eins by
a Confluence of Blood, the very abstract of all the greatest houses in
Christendom, and remarkable it is (concerning that violent desertion of the
Royal House of the Britains, by the invasion of the Saxons, and afterward by
the Conquest of the Normanes, that by their vicissitude of times, and through a
discontinuance (almost a thousand years) the Royal Scepter should fall back
into the Current of the old B^i^^sh Blood, in the person of Her renowned
Grandfather, Henry the seventh, together with whatsoever the German, Norman,
Burgund^an, Castalian, and French achievements with the intermarriages, which
eighth hundred years had acquired, incorporated, and brought back into the old
Royal Ryne.

By Her Mother She was of no Sovereign descent, yet Noble, and very Ancient in
the Name, and Family of Bullen, though some erroniously brand it with a
Citizens rise, or original, which was yet but of a second Brother, who (as it
were) divining the greatness, and luster to come to his House, was sent into
the City to acquire wealth, ad edific (...) antiquam domum, unto whose
achievements (for he was Lord Major of London) fell in as it was averred, both
the blood and inheritance of the eldest Brother, for want of issue Male, by
which accumulation the house within a few discents mounted in Culmen hororis,
and was suddenly lated into the best Families of England, and Ireland as
Haward, Ormund Sock^i^e, and diverse other having thus touched, and now leaving
Her strip, I come to Her Person; and as She came to the Crown by the decease of
Her Brother and Sister: under Edward She was His, and one of the darlings of
Fortune, for besides the consideration of Blood, there was between these two
Princes, a concurrency, and sympathy in their Natures, and affections
together, with the Celestial bond (Conformity in Religion) which made them
one, and friends, for the King ever called Her His sweetest and dearest Sister,
and was scarce His own man, She being absent, which was not so between Him and
the Lady Mary.

Under His Sister, She found Her condition much altered: for it was resolved,
and her destiny had decreed to set Her an Apprentice in the School of
affliction, and to draw Her thorough the Ordeall fire of trial, the better to
mould and fashion Her, to rule, and Sovereignty: which finished, and Fortune
calling to mind, that the time of Her servitude was expired, gave up Her
Indentures, and therewith delivered up into Her Custody a Scepter, as a reward
for Her patience, which was about the twenty sixth year of Her Age; a time in
which (as for externals) She was full blown, so was She for Her internals grown
ripe, and seasoned with adversity, and in the exercise of Her Virtue, for it
seems Fortune meant no more, then to show Her a piece of Her variety, and
changeableness of Her Nature, and so to conduct Her Her destin^d Felicity.

She was of personge tall, of hair and complexion fair, and therewith well
favored, but high nosed, of lymbs, and feature neat, and which added to the
luster of those exterior Graces, of Stately, and Majestic comportment,
participating in this more of Her Father then Mother, who was of an inferior
allay, plausable, or as the French has it, more debonare, and affable,
virtues, which might well suite with Majesty, and which descending, as
Hereditary to the Daughter, did render Her of a more sweeter temper, and
endeared Her more to the love and liking of the people, who gave Her the name
and fame of a most gracious and popular Prince, the atrocity of Her Fathers
nature, being rebated in Hers, by the Mothers sweeter inclinations for to take,
and that no more then the Character out of His own mouth, He never spared man
in His anger, nor woman in His lust.

If we search further into Her intellectuals and abilities, the whole course of
Her government desciphers them to the admiration of posterity, for it was full
of magnanimity tempered with Justice, and Piety, and to speak truly, noted but
with one act or taint, all Her deprivations either of life or liberty, being
legal, and necessitated: She was learned (Her sex, and the time considered)
beyond common belief; for letters about this time, and somewhat before, began
to be of esteem, and in fashion, the former ages being overcast with the mists
and fogs of the Roman ignorance, (...) it was the maxim that overruled the
foregoing times, that ignorance was the mother of devotion.

Her wars were along time more, in the auxiliary part, in assistance of
foreign Princes, and States, then by invasion of any, till common policy
advised it for a safer way, to strike first, and broad, then at home, to expect
the war, in all which she was felicious, and victorious.

The change and alteration of Religion upon the instant of Her accession (the
smoke and fire of Her Sisters Martyrdomes, scarcely quenched) was none of Her
least remarkable accounts. But the support and establishment thereof, with the
means of Her subsistence amidst so powerful enemies abroad, and those many
domestique practices, were (methinks) works of inspiration, and of no humane
providence, which on Her Sisters departure, She most religiously acknowledged,
ascribing the glory of Her deliverance to God alone, for She received the news
both of the Queens death, and her proclamation, by the general consent of the
House, and the public suffrage of the people, whereat, falling on her knees
(after a good time of respiration) she uttered this Verse of the Psalms, A
domino fa^tum est istud, and est in^nable inoculis nostris, which we find to
this day on the stamp of her gold, with this on her silver, Posui Deumad,
^^^rem meum.

Her Ministers and Instruments of State, such as were participes (...) and bare
a great part of the burden, were many, and those memorable, but they were
only Favorites, not Mimions; such as acted more by her own Princely rules and
judgments, then by their own wills and appetites, which she observed to the
last: for we find no Gaveston, Vere, or Spencer, to have swayed alone, during
forty four years, which was a well settled, and advised maxim, for it valued
her the more, it awed the most secure, and it took best with the people, and it
starved all emulations, which are apt to rise and vent in obloquious acrimony
(even against the Prince) where there is only A Major Palatii.

The principal note of her reign, will be, that she ruled much by faction and
parties, which her self, both made, upheld, and weakened, as her own great
judgment advised, for I disassent from the common received opinion, that my
Lord of Leicester, was absolute and above all in her Grace: and though I come
somewhat short of the knowledge of those times: yet (that I might not rove, and
shoot at random) I know it from assured intelligence, that it was not so, for
proof whereof (among many that I could present) I will both relate, a short,
and ther^^, a known truth; And it was thus, Bawyer a Gentleman of the
Black-rod, being charged by her express command, to look precisely to all
admissions into the Privy-Chamber, one day stayed a very gay Captain, and a
follower of my Lord of Leicesters, from entrance; for that he was neither well
known, nor a sworn servant to the Queen, at which repulse the Gentleman bearing
high on my Lords favor, told him, he might perchance procure him a discharge:
Leicester coming into the Contestation, said publicly (which was none of his
want) that he was a Knave, and should not continue long in his office; and so
turning about to go into the Queen, Bowyer (who was a bold Gentleman, and
welbeloved) stepped before him, and fell at Her Majesty's seet, related the
story, and humbly craves Her Graces pleasure, and whether my Lord of Leicester
was King, or Her Majesty Queen, whereunto she replied, with her wonted oath
(Gods death) my Lord, I have wished you well, but my favor is not so locked up
for you, that others shall not partake thereof, for I have many servants, unto
whom I have, and will at my pleasure bequeath my favor, and like wise resume
the same, and if you think to rule here, I will take a course to see you forth
coming, I will have here but one Mistress, and no Master; and look that no ill
happen to him, least it be severely required at your hands, which so quelled my
Lord of Leicester, that his fained humility, was long after one of his best
virtues; Moreover the Earl of Sussex then Lord Chamberlain, was his professed
Antagonist to his dying day; and for my Lord of Hunsdone, and Sir Thomas
Sackvile, after Lord Treasurer (who were all Contemporaries) he was wont to say
of them, that they were of the Tribe of Dan, and were Noli me tangeres,
implying, that they were not to be contested with, for they were indeed of the
Queens near kindred; from whence, and in more instances I conclude that she was
absolute and Sovereign Mistress of Her Graces: and that all those, to whom, she
distributed her favors, were never more then Tenants at will, and stood on no
better ground then her Princely pleasure, and their own good behavior; and
this also I present as a known observation, that she was (though very capable
of Council) absolute enough in her own resolutions, which was ever apparent
even to her last, in that her aversation to grant Tyrone the least drop of her
mercy, though earnestly and frequently advised, yea wrought only by the whole
Counsel of State, with very many pressing reasons; and as the state of her
Kingdom then stood (I may speak it with assurance) necessitated Arguments.

If we look into her inclination, as it is disposed either to magnificence, or
frugality, we shall find in them many notable considerations, for all her
dispensations were so poysed, as though discretion and Justice had both agreed
to stand at the beam, and see them weighed out in due proportion, the maturity
of her years, and judgment meeting in a concurrency, and at such an age as
seldom lapseth to excess.

To consider them apart, we have not many presidents of her liberality, or of
any large donatives to particular men; my Lord of Essex Book of Parkes only
excepted, which was a Princely gift, and some few more of a lesser size to my
Lord of Leicester, Hatton, and others. Her reward consisted chiefly in grants
of Leases, of Offices, and places of Indicature, but for ready money, and in
any great sums, she was very sparing, which we partly conceive was a virtue
rather drawn out by necessity, then her nature, for she had many layings out,
and to her last period. And I am of opinion with Sir Walter Rawleigh, that
those many brave men of our times, and of the Militiae, tasted little more of
her bounty, then in her grace, and good word with their due entertainment, for
she ever paid the Soldiers well, which was the honor of her times, and more
then her great adversary of Spain could perform, so that when we come to the
consideration of her frugality, the observation will be little more, then that
her bounty, and it were so woven together, that the one was suited by an
honorable way of spending, the other limited by a necessitated way of
sparing.

The Irish action we may call a mallady, and a Consumption of her times: for
it accompanied her to her end, and it was of so profuse, and vast an expense,
that it drevv near a distemperature of State, and of passion in her self, for
tovvard her last, she grevv somevvhat hard to please, her Arms being
accustomed to prosperity, and the Irish persecution, not answering her
expectation, and wonted success for a good while, it was an unthrifty, and
inauspitious war which did much disturb, and mislead her judgment; and
the more for that it was a president, which was taken out of her own
Pattern; for as the Queen (by way of diversion) had at the coming to the
Crown, supported the revolted States of Holland, so did the King of Spain turn
the trick on her self toward her going out, by cherishing the Irish
rebellion, where it falls into consideration, what the State of the Kingdom,
and the Crown revenevvs were then able to embrace, and endure; if we look
into the establishment of those times, with the list of the Irish Army,
considering the defeatments of Blackvvater, vvithall precedent expenses, as it
stood from my Lord of Essex, undertaking to the surrender of Kingsale under the
General Mountioy; and somevvhat after, we shall find the horse and foot
Troops, were for three or four years together much about 20000, Which
besides, the Navall charge which was a dependant of the same War; in that
the Queen was then forced to keep in continual pay, a strong Fleet at Sea, to
attend the Spanish Coasts, and Ports, both to allarum the Spaniard, and to
interpret his Forces designed for the Irish assistance; so that the charge of
that War alone, did cost the Queen 300000. p^^annum at least, which was not
the moytie of her other disbursements, an expense which (without the public
aid) the State, and the Royal reccipts, could not have much longer endured,
which out of her own frequent Letters and complaints to the Deputy Mountioy
for casheering part of that List, as soon as he could, may be collected, for
the Queen was then driven into a strait.

We are naturally proan to applaud the times behind us, and to villifie the
present, for the current of her fame carries it to this day, how Royal^y and
victoriously she lived and dyed, without the grievance and grudge of the
people, yet that truth may appear without retraction from the honor of so
great a Princess, It is manifest she left more debts unpayed, taken upon the
credit of her Privy-Seals, then her Progenitors did, or could have taken up
that way in a hundred years before her, which was an enforced piece of
State, to lay the burden on that horse, that was best able to bear it, at the
dead lift, when neither her receipts could yield her relief at the pinch, nor
the urgency of her affairs endure the delays of Parliamentary assistance, and
for such aides it is likewise apparent, that she received more, and with the
love of the people, then any two of her predecessors, that took most, which
was a Fortune strained out of the Subject, through the plause ability of her
Comportment, and as I would say without offense the prodigal distribution of
her Graces to all sorts of Subjects, for I believe no Prince living that was so
tender of honor, and so exactly stood for the preservation of sovereignty,
that was so great a Courtier of her people, yea of the Commons, and that stoopt
and descended lower in presenting her person to the public view, as she past
in her progresses and perambulations, and in the ejaculation of her prayers on
her people; and truly though much may be given in praise of her magnanimity,
and there with comply with her Parliaments, and for all that come off at last
with honor and profit, yet must we ascribe some part of the commendation to
the wisdoms of the times, and the choice of Parliament men, for I find not
that they were at any time given to any violent or pertinatious dispute,
elections being made of grave and discreet persons, not factious and ambitious
of fame, such as came not to the house with a malevolent spirit of contention,
but with a preparation to consult on the public good, rather to comply, then
contest with her Majesty, neither do I find that the house was at any time
weakened and pestered with the admission of too many young heads, as it has
been of later times, which remembers me of Recorder Martins speech, about the
tenth of our late Sovereign Lord King James, when there were accounts taken of
forty Gentlemen, not above twenty, and some not exceeding sixteen, which moved
him to say, that it was the ancient custom for old men to make Laws for young
ones, but that then he saw, the case altered, and that there were children
elected unto the great Council of the Kingdom, which came to invade and
invert nature, and to inact Laws to govern their Fathers: sure we are, the
house always took the common cause into their consideration, and they saw the
Queen had just occasion, and need enough to use their assistance, neither do I
remember that the house did ever Capitulate or prefer their private to the
public, etc. The Queens necessities, but waited their times, and in the first
place gave their supply, and according to the exigency of her affairs, yet
failed not at last to obtain what they desired, so that the Queen and her
Parliaments had ever the good Fortune to depart in love, and on reciprocal
terms, which are considerations which have not been so exactly observed in our
last assemblies, as they might, and I would to God they had been for
considering the great debt lest on the King, and in what encumbrances the house
it self had then drawn him, his Majesty was not well used, though I lay not the
blame on the whole suffrage of the house, where he had many good friends, for I
dare avouch, had the house been freed of half a dozen of populer and
discontented persons, such (as with the fellow that burnt the Temple at
Ephesus) would be talked of, though but for doing of mischief, I am confident
the King had obtained, that which in reason, and at his first accession, he
ought to have received freely, and without any condition, But pardon the
digression, which is here remembered, not in the way of aggravation, but in true
zeal to the public good, and presented in caveat to future times, for I am not
ignorant how the spirit of the Kingdom now moves to make his Majesty amends on
any occasion, and how desirous the Subject is to expiate that offense at any
rate, may it please his Majesty graciously to make trial of his Subjects
affection, and at what price they now value his goodness and magnanimity. But
to our purpose, the Queen was not to learn, that as the strength of her
Kingdom consisted in the multitude of her Subjects, for the security of her
person rested in the love and fidelity of her people, which she politiquely
affected (as it has been thought) somewhat beneath the hight of her spirit,
and natural magnanimity. Moreover it will be a true note of her providence,
that she would always listen to her profit, for she would not refuse the
informations of mean persons, with purposed improvement, and had learned the
Philosophy of Hoc ag^re, to look into her own work, of the which there is a
notable example of one Carwarden an under Officer of the custom house, who
observing his time presented her with a paper, showing how she was abused in
the under renting of her customs, and therewithal humbly desired her Majesty
to conceal him, for that it did concern two or three of her great Counselors,
whom customer Smith had bribed with 200. a man, so to loose the Queen 2000. per
annum, which being made known to the Lords, they gave strickt order, that
Carwarden should not have access to the back stairs, till at last her Majesty
smelling the craft, and missing Carwarden, she sent for him back, and
encouraged him to stand to his information, which the poor man did so
handsomely, that within the space of ten years, he brought Smith to double his
rent, or to leave the customs to new Farmers, so that we may take this also
into observation, that there were of the Queens Council that were not in the
Catalogue of Saints.

Now as we have taken a view of some particular notions of her times, her
nature, and necessities, it is not without the text, to give, a short touch on
the helps and advantages of her reign, which were without parallel, for she had
neither husband, brother, sister, nor children to provide for, who as they are
dependants of the Crown, so do they necessarily draw maintenance from thence,
and do often times exhaust and draw deep especially when there is an ample
fraternity of the blood Royal, and of the Princes of the Blood, as it was in
the time of Edward the third, and Henry the fourth, for then when the Crown
cannot, the public ought to give them honorable allowance, for they are the
honor and hopes of the Kingdom, and the public which injoyes them, has
alike interest in them, with the Father that begot them; and our Common Law,
which is the heritance of the Kingdom, did ever of old provide ayds for the
primogenitures, and the eldest daughter; so that the multiplicity of Courts,
and the great charge which necessarily follow a King, and Queen, a Prince, and
the Royal issue, was a thing which was not in rerum natura, during the space
of forty years, and which by time was worn out of memory, and without the
cons^deration of the present times, Insomuch, that the aids given to the late
and right noble Prince Henry, and to his sister the Lady Elizabeth, were at
first generally received for impositions of a new Coynage. Yea the late
impositions for Knightwood (though an ancient Law) fell also into the
imputation of a tax of novelty, for that it lay long covered in the embers of
division, between the Houses of York and Lancaster, and forgotten, or connived
at by the succeeding Princes, so that the strangeness of the observation, and
the difference of those latter reigns is; that the Queen took up beyond the
power of the Law, which fell not into the murmr of the people, and her
successors nothing but by warrant of the Law, which nevertheless was conceived
(through disuse) to be injurious to the liberty of the Kingdom.

Now before I come to any further mention of her favorits (for hitherto I have
delivered, but some obvious passages, thereby to prepare and smooth a way for
the rest that follows) it is requisite that I touch on the relics of the
other reign, I mean the body of her sisters Council of State, which she
retained entire; neither removing, nor discontenting any, although she knew
them averse to her Religion (and in her sisters time perverse toward her
person) and private to her troubles and imprisonment: A prudence which was
incomparable with her sisters nature, for she both dissipated and persecuted
the major part of her brothers Council, but this will be of certainty, that
how compliable soever, and obsequious she found them, yet for a good space she
made little use of their Counsels, more then in the ordinary course of the
board: for she held a dormant Table in her own Princely breast, yet she kept
them together, and their places without any sudden change, so that we may say
of them, that they were of the Court, not of the Council, for whilst she
amazed them with a kind of premissive disputation concerning the points
controverted by both Churches, she did set down her own reservations, without
their privity, and made all her progressions gradations. But so that the
tenants of her secrecy with intent of her establishment, were pitched before it
was known where the Court would sit down; neither do I find that any of her
sisters Council of state were either repugnant to her religion, or opposed her
doings (Engl^field, Master of the horse excepted) who withdrew himself from the
board, and shortly after from out her Dominions, so pliable and obedient they
were to change with the times, and their Princes, and of this there will fall
in here a relation both of recreation, and of known truth* Pawle^ Marquess of
Wincheste^, and Lord Treasurer, having served then four Princes in as various
and changeable season, that I may well say, time, nor any age has yielded the
like president.

This man being noted to grow high in her favor (as his place, and experience
required) was questioned by an intimate friend of his, how he stood up for
thirty years together amidst the changes, and reigns of so many Chancellors
and great personages, why quoth the Marquess, Ortus sunt ex salice, non ex
que^cu, I was made of the pliable Willovv, not of the stubborn Oak, and truly
the old man has taught them all, especially William Earl of Pembroke, for they
two were alvvayes of the Kings religion, and over zealous professors. Of this
it is said, that being both younger brothers (yet of noble Houses) they spent
what was left them, and come on trust to the Court, vvhereupon the bare stock
of their Wits, they began to traffic for themselves, and prospered so well,
that they got, spent, and left more then any Subjects from the Norman Conquest,
to their own times, whereunto it has been prettily replied, that they lived
in a time of dissolution. To conclude them, of any of the former reign, ir is
said, that these two lived and dyed (chiefly) in her favor. The latter upon
his sons marriage, which the Lady K^th rine Gray, vv^s like utterly to have
lost himself, but at the instant of the consummation, apprehending the
insafety, and danger of an intermarriage with the blood Royal, he fell at the
Queens feet, where he both acknowledged his presumption with tears, and
projected the cause, and the divorce together, and so quick he was at his
work (for it stood him upon) that upon repudiation of the Lady, he clapped up a
marriage for his son the Lord Herbert with M^r* Sidney Daughrer to Sir Henry
Sydney, then Lord Deputy of Ireland, the blovv falling on Edward late Earl of
Hereford* who (to his cost) took up the divorced Lady, of whom the Lord
Beauchampe was borne, and William Earl of Hereford is descended. I come how to
present those of her own election, which she either admitted to her secrets of
State, or took into her grace and favor, of whom in their order, I crave leave
to give unto posterity a cautious description, with a short Charracter, or
draught of the persons themselves: for without offense to others, I would be
true to my self, their memories and merits distinguishing them of the militiae,
from the (...) and of these she had as many, and those as able Ministers, as
any of her Progenitors.

Leicester.
IT will be out of doubt, that my Lord of Leicester was one of the first whom
she made Master of the Horse, he was the youngest Son (then living) of the
Duke Northumberland beheaded (...), and his Father was that Du^y, which our
Histories couple with (...); and both so much infamed for the Caterpillars of
the Commonwealth, during the reign of Henry the seventh: who being a noble
extract, was executed the first year of Henry the eighth, but not thereby so
extinct, but that he left a plentiful estate, and such a Son, who (as the
vulgar speaks it) could live without the teat; for out of the Ashes of his
Fathers infamy, he rose to be a Duke, and as high, as subjection could permit,
or Sovereignty endure; and though he could not find out any appellation to
assume the Crown in his own person, yet he projected, and very nearly effected
it for his Son Gu^lbert, by intermarriage with the Lady (...) Gray, and so by
that way to bring it about into his loins: Observations, which though they lie
behind us, and seem impertinent to the Text, yet are they not much
extravagant, for they must lead, and show us how the after passages were
brought about with the dependances, and on the hinges of a collateral
workmanship: and truly, it may amaze a well settled judgment to look back
into those times, and to consider how this Duke could attain to such a pitch of
greatness, his Father dying in ignominy, and at the Gallows, his estate
con^iscate, and that for peeling and polling, by the clamor, and cruci^^ge of
the people, but when we better think upon it, we find that he was given up,
but as a Sacrifice to please the people, not for any offense committed against
the person of the King, so that upon the matter he was a Martyr of the
Prerogative, and the King in honor could do no less then give back to his Son
the privilege of his blood, with the acquirings of his Fathers profession, for
he was a Lawyer, and of the Kings Council, at Law before he came to be ex
(...), where besides the lickings of his own fingers, he got the King a Mass
of riches, and that not with the hazard, but the loss of his fame and life,
for the Kings Fathers sake. Certain it is, that his son was left rich in
purse and brain, which are good foundations, and full to ambition, and it may
be supposed, he was on all occasions well heard of the King, as a person of
mark and compassion in his eye, but I find not that he did put up for
advancement, during Henry the eights time, although a vast aspirer, and
provident storier. It seems he thought the Kings reign was much given to the
falling sickness, but espying his time fitting, and the Sovereignty in the
hands of a pupil Prince, he thought he might as well, then put up for it, as
the best, for having then possession of blood, and a purse, with a head-peece
of a vast extent, he soon got honor, and no sooner there, but he began to side
it with the best, even with the Protector; and in conclusion got his, and his
Brothers heads* still aspyring, till he expired, in the loss of his own, so
that posterity may by reading the Father and the Grandfather, make judgment of
the son; for we shall find that this Robert (whose original we have now
traced the better to present him) was inheritor of the genius, and craft of his
Father; and Ambrose, of the estate, of whom hereafter we shall make some short
mention.

We take him now as he was admitted into the Court, and the Queens favor,
where he was not to seek to play his part well, and dexteriously. But his play
was chiefly at the forgame, not that he was a learner at the latter, but he
loved not the after wit, for they report (and I think not untruely) that he was
seldom behind hand with his Gamesters, and that they always went away with
the loss.

He was a very godly person, and singular well featured, and all his youth well
favored, and of a sweet aspect, but high foreheaded, which as I should take
it, was of no discommendation: but toward his latter end (which with old men,
was but a middle age) he grew high colored and red faced; so that the Queen in
this, had much of her Father, for (excepting some of her kindred, and some few
that had handsome wits in crooked bodies, she always took personage in the way
of her election, for the people has it to this day in proverb, King Harry
loved a man: Being thus in her grace, she called to mind, the sufferings of
his Ancestors, both in her Fathers and sisters reigns, and restored his, and
his brothers blood, creating Ambr^s the elder, Earl of Warwick, and himself,
Earl of Leicester, etc. And he was ex rimiti^s, or of her first choice, for he
rested not there, but long enjoyed her favor; and therewith, much what he
listed, till time and emulation (the companions of great ones) had resolved on
his period, and to cover him at his setting in a cloud at Cornebury* not by so
violent a death, and by the fatal sentence of judicature, as that of his
Fathers, and Grandfathers was, but as it is suggested by that poison which he
had prepared for others, wherein they report him a rare Artist, I am not bound
to give credit to all vulgar relations, or to the libells of the times, which
are commonly forced, and falsified suitable to the moods, and humors of men,
in passion, and discontent, but that which leads me to think him no good man,
is (amongst others of known truth) that of my Lord of Essex death in Ireland,
and the marriage of his Lady yet living, which I forbear to press, in regard
that he is long since dead, and others living, whom it may concern.

To take him in the observations of his Letters, and Writings (which should
best set him off) for such as fell into my hands, I never yet saw a style or
phrase, more seeming religious, and fuller of the strains of devotion, and were
they not sincere, I doubt much of his well being, and I may fear he was too
well seen in the Aphorisms and principles of Nicholas the Florentine, and in
the reaches of Caesar Borgia; and hitherto I have only touched him in his
Courtship. I conclude him in his Lance, he was sent Governor by the Queen to
the united States of Holland, where we read not of his wonders, for they say
that he had more of Mercury then Mars, and that his device might have been,
without prejudice to the great Caesar, Veni, vidi, redii.

Sussex.
HIs Corrivall before mentioned, was Thomas Radcliff Earl: of Sussex, who, (in
his constellation was his direct opposite) for he was indeed one of the Queens
Martialists, and did very good service in Ireland, at her first accession, till
she recalled him to the Court, where she made him Lord Chamberlain, but he
played not his game with that cunning, and dexterity, as Leiceste did, who was
much the more faceate Courtier, though Sussex was thought much the honester
man, and far the better soldier, but he lay too open on his guard.

He was a goodly Gentleman, and of a brave Noble nature, true and constant to
his friends and servants, he was also of a very Noble and ancient Lyneage,
honored through many descents by the Title of Viscounts, Fitzwalters: Moreover
there was such an Antipathy in his nature to that of Leicesters that being
together in Court, and both in high employments they grew to a direct
frowardness, and were in continual opposition, the on setting the watch, the
other the sentinel, each on the other actions and motions, for my Lord of
Sussex was of a great spirit, which backed with the Queens special favor, and
supported by a great and ancient inheritance, could not brook the others
Empire: Insomuch as the Queen upon sundry occasions had somewhat to do to
appease, and attain them, until death parted the competition, and let the
place of Leiceste^, who was not long alone without his rival in grace and
command, and to conclude this Favorite, it is confidently affirmed, that lying
in his last sickness, he gave this caveat to his friends, I am now passing
into another world, and I must now leave you to your Fortunes, and to the
Queens grace, and goodness: but beware of the Gipsey, meaning L^ice^ter, for
he will be to hard for you all, you know not the best so well as I do.

Lord Burleigh.
I Now come to the next, which was Secretary William Cecill, for on the death
of the old Marquess of Winchester* he came up in his room, a person of a most
subtle and active spirit, who though he stood not altogether by the way of
constellation, and making up of a part and faction, for he was wholly intentive
to the service of his Mistress, and his dexterity, experience, and merit,
challenged a room in the Queens favor, which ecclipsed the others over seeming
greatness, and made it appear that there were others that steered, and stood
at the Helm besides himself, and more Stars in the Firmament of her grace
then, (...) Mayor, or the Bear with the ragged staff.

He was borne (as they say in Lincola^ shire, but as some upon knowledge
aver, of a younger Brother of the Cecills of Hartford-shire, a family (of my
own knowledge) though now private, yet of no mean antiquity, who being
exposed, and sent to the City, as poor Gentleman use to do their younger
Sonn^s, he came to be a rich man on Lo^^o-bridge, and pu^chasing in
Lincol^-shire, where this man was born, he was sent to Cambridge, then to
the Innes of Court, and so he came to serve the Duke of Ommerse^ in the time of
his Protectership, as Secretary, and having a pregnancy to great inclinations,
he came by degrees to a higher conversation with the chiefest affairs of
State, and Councels; but on the fall of the Duke he stood some years in
umbrage, and without employment, till the State found and needed his abilities,
and though we find not that he was taken into any place, during Mary's reign,
unless (as some have said) toward the last, yet the Council on several
occasions made use of him, and at the Queens entrance he was admitted Secretary
of State, afterward he was made Master of the Court of Wards, then Lord
Treasurer, a person of most requisite abilities; and indeed the Queen began
then to need, and to seek out for men of both Garbs, and so I conclude, and
rank this great Instrument of State, amongst the Togati, for he had not to do
with the sword, more then as the great play master, and Contriver of the War,
which shortly followed, wherein he accomplished much thorough his theoricall
knowledge at home, and his intelligence abroad, by unlocking the Counsels of
the Queens enemies.

We must now take (and that of truth) into observation, that until the tenth
of her reign, her times were calm and serene, though sometimes a little
overcast, as the most glorious Sun risings, are subject to shadowings and
droppings in, for the clouds of Spain, and Vapors of the holy League, began
then to disperse and threaten her serenity; Moreover, she was then to provide
against some intestine storms, which began to gather in the very heart of her
Kingdom, all which had a relation, and correspondency, each with the other to
dethrone her, and to disturb the public tranquillity, and therewithal (as a
principal work) the established Religion, for the name of Recusant began then,
and first to be known to the World, and till then the Catholics were no more
then Church Papists, but were commanded by the Popes express letters, to
appear, and forbear Church going, as they tender their holy Father, and the
holy Catholic Church their Mother: so that it seems the Pope had then his ayms
to take a true muster of his children, but the Queen had the greater advantage,
for she likewise took tale of her apostate Subjects, their strength, and how
many they were that had given up their names unto Baal, who then by the hands
of some of his Prosilits fixed his Bulls on the Gates of Paul's, which
discharged her Subjects of all fidelity, and laid siege to the received faith,
and so under the vail of the next Successor, to replant the Catholic Religion,
so that the Queen had then a new task and work in hand, that might well awak
her best providence, and required a muster of men of Arms, as well as
Courtships, and Councels, for the times began then to be quick and active,
fitter for stronger motions, then those of the Carpet, and measure, and it will
be a true note of her magnanimity, that she loved a soldier, and had a
propension in her nature to regard, and always to grace them, which the
Courtiers taking into observation, took it as an invitation to win honor,
together with their Majesty's favor, by exposing themselves to the Wars,
especially when the Queens, and the affairs of the Kingdom stood in some
necessity of a Soldier, for we have many instances of the Sallies of the
Nobility, and Gentry, yea and out of the Court, and her Privy favorits (that
had any touch or tincture of Mars in their inclinations, and to steal away
without license, and the Queens privity, which had like to have cost some of
them dear, so predominant were their thoughts and hopes of honor growing in
them, as we may truly observe in the expositions of Sir Philip Sydney, my Lord
of Essex, Mountjoy, and diverse others, whose absence, and the manner of their
cruptions, was very distasteful to her: whereof I can here add a true, and no
impertinent Story, and that of the last Mountjoy, who having twice or thrice,
stolen away into Britain (where under Sir John Norris he had then a company)
without the Queens leave and privity, she sent a Messenger unto him, with a
strict charge to the general to see him sent home, when he came into the
Queens presence, she fell into a kind of reviling, demanding how he durst go
over without her leave, serve me so quoth she once more, and I will lay you
fast enough for running: you will never leave until you are knocked on the
head, as that inconsiderate fellovv Sydney was, you shall go when I send you,
in the mean time see that you lodge in the Court (which was then at
White Hall) where you may follovv your Book, read and discourse of the Wars.

But to our purpose it fell out happily to those, and (as I may say) to those
times, that the Queen during the calm of her reign was not idle, not rockt a
sleep with security, for she had been very provident in the Reparation, and
Augmentation of her Shipping, and Ammunition; and I know not, whether by a
foresight of policy, or an instinct, it came about, or whether it was an act
of her compassion. But it is most certain, that she sent Levies, and no small
Troops to the assistance of the revolted States of Holland, before she had
received any affront from the King of Spain, that might deserve, or tend to a
breach in hostility, which the Papists to this day maintain, was the
provocation, and cause of the after Wars, but omitting what might be said to
this point, those Netherland Wars were the Queens Seminaries, and the
Nurseries of very many brave Soldiers, and so were likewise the Civil
Wars of France (vvhither she sent five several Armies) the Fenceschooles
that inured the youth and Gallantry of the Kingdom, and it was a Militia
wherein they were daily in acquaintance, with the discipline of the Spaniard^,
who were then turned the Queens inveterate enemies.

And this have I taken into observation, her Di^s Halci^nii, those years of
hers which were more serene and quiet then those that followed, which though
they were not less propitious, as being touched more with the point of honor
and victory, yet were they troubled, and ever clouded over, both with
domestiques, and foreign macchinations, and it is already quoted, they were
such as awakened her spirits, and made her cast about how to defend, rather by
offending, and by the way of diversion to prevent all invasions, then to expect
them, which was a piece of policy of the times, and with this I have noted the
causes or principia of the Wars following, and likewise pointed to the
seed-plots, from whence she took up those brave men, and plants of honor,
which acted on the theater of Mars, and on whom she dispersed the rays of her
grace, which were persons in their kinds of rare virtues, and such as might
(out of height of merit) pretend interest to her favor, of which rank, the
number will equal, if not exceed that of the Gown-men, in recount of whom I
proceed with Sir Philip Sydney.

Sir Philip Sydney.
HE was son to Sir Henry Sydney, Lord Deputy of Ireland, and President of
Wales, a person of great parts, and in no mean grace with the Queen, his Mother
was Sister to my Lord of Leicester, from whence we may conjecture, how the
Father stood up in the place of honor, and employment, so that his descent was
apparently noble on both sides; for his education, it was such as travel, and
the university could afford, or his Tutors infuse, for after an incredible
proficiency in all the species of learning, he left the Academiall life, for
that of the Court; whither he came by his Uncles invitation, famed aforehand by
a noble report of his accomplishments, which together with the state of his
person, framed by a natural propension to Arms, he soon attracted the good
opinion of all men, and was so highly prized in the good opinion of the Queen,
that she thought the Court deficient without him, and whereas (through the fame
of his deserts) he was in the election, for the Kingdom of Pole, she refused
to further his advancement, not out of emulation, but out of fear to loose the
jewel of her times; he married the Daughter and sole heir of Sir Francis
Walsingham, then Secretary of State, a Lady destinated to the Bed of honor,
who (after his deplorable death at Zutphen in the Netherlands, where he was
Governor of Vl^ishing, and at the time of his Uncles being there) was married
to my Lord of Essex, and since his death, to my Lord of Saint Albons, all
persons of the sword, and otherwise of great honor and virtue.

They have a very quaint, and factious figment of him, that Mar^ and Mercury
fell at variance, whose servant he should be, and there is an Epigrammist that
says, that Art and Nature had spent their excellencies in his fashioning, and
fearing they should not end what they begun, they bestowed him on Fortune, and
nature stood musing, and amassed to behold her own work. But these are the
petulancies of Poets.

Certain it is, he was a noble and matchless Gentleman, and it may be justly
said without hiperboles of fiction, as it was of Coto (...), that he seemed to
be borne, to that only which he went about Versalitis ingenii, as Plutarch
has it, but to speak more of him, were to make him less.

Sir Francis Walsingham.
SIR Francis Walsingham, (as we have said) had the honor to be Sir Philip
Sydneys Father in Law, he was a Gentleman (at first) of a good house: but of a
better education, and from the University traveled for the rest of his
learning, he was doubtless the best Ling^ist of the times, but knew best how
to use his own tongue, whereby he came to be employed in the chiefest affairs
of State; he was sent Ambassador into France, and stayed there Leiger long, in
the heat of the Civil Wars, and at the same time, that Monsieur was here a
Suitor to the Queen, and if I be not mistaken, he played the very same part
there, as since Gundam^re did here; at his return he was taken principal
Secretary, and was one of the great Engines of State, and of the times, high in
the Queens favor, and a watchful servant over the safety of his Mistress.

They note him to have had certain curiosities, and secret ways of
intelligence above the rest, but I must confess I am to seek; Wherefore he
suffered Parry to play so long on the hook, before he hoysed him up; and I have
been a little curious in the search thereof, though I have not to do with the
Arcan^ Imperii.

For to know is sometimes a burden, and I remember, that it was Ovids c^imen
aut error, that he saw too much. But I hope these are Collateralls of no
danger; but that Parry having an intent to kill the Queen, made the way of his
access, by betraying of others, and impeaching of the Priests of his own
correspondency, and thereby had access and conference with the Queen; and also
oftentimes familiar, and private conference with Walsingham, will not be the
quere of the Mystery, for the Secretary might have had end of discovery on a
further maturity of the Treason, but that after the Queen knew Parryes intent,
why she should then admit him to private Discourse, and Walsingham to suffer
it, considering the condition of all assaylngs, and to permit him to go, where,
and whether he listed, and only on the security of a dark sentinel set over
him, was a piece of reach and hazard, beyond my apprehension.

I must again profess, that having read many of his Letters (for they are
commonly sent to my Lord of Leicester, and Burleigh out of France, containing
many fine passages, and secrets, yet if I might have been beholding to his
Ciphers (whereof they are full) they would have told pretty tales of the times,
but I must now close up, and rank him amongst the Togati, yet chief of those
that laid the foundation of the French and Dutch Wars, which was another
piece of his finenesse, and of the times, with one observation more; that he
was one of the great allayes of the Austerian embracements, for both himself
and Stafford that preceded him, might well have been compared to the fiend in
the Gospel, that sowed his tares in the night, so did they their feeds of
division in the dark, and it is a likely report that they father on him, at his
return, that the Queen said unto him with some sensibility of the S^anish
designs, on France, Madam I beseech you be content not to fear, the Spaniard
has a great appetite, and an excellent digestion, but I have fitted him with a
Bone for this twenty years, that your Majesty shall have no cause to doubt him,
provided that if the fire chance to slack, which I have kindled, you will be
ruled be me, and now, and then cast in some English fuel, which will revive
the flame.

Willoughby.
MY Lord Willoughby, was one of the Queens first sword men, he was of the
ancient extract of the Bart^^s, but more ennobled by his Mother, who was
Duchess of Suffolk.

He was a great Master of the Art Military, and was sent General into France,
and commanded the second of five Armies, that the Queen sent thither in aid of
the French: I have heard it spoken that had he not slighted the Court, but
applied himself to the Queen, he might have enjoyed a plentiful portion of her
grace, and it was his saying (and it did him no good) that he was none of the
R^plitia, intimating, that he could not creep on the ground, and that the Court
was not his Element, for indeed as he was a great Soldier, so was he of a
suitable magnanimity, and could not brook the obsequiousness, and a^^iduity of
the Court, and as he then was somewhat descending from youth, happily he had,
an animam re^crendi and to make a safe retreat.

Sir Nicholas Bacon.
I Come to another of the Togati, Sir Nicholas Bacon, an arch piece of Wit and
Wisdom, he was a Gentleman, and a man of Law, and of great knowledge therein,
whereby, together with his other parts of learning and dexterity, he was
promoted to be Keeper of the great Seal, and being of Kin to the Treasurer
Burleigh, had also the help of his hand to bring him into the Queens favor,
for he was abundantly factious, which took much with the Queen, when it was
suited with the season, as he was well able to judge of his times; he had a
very quaint saying, and he used it often to good purpose, that he loved the
jest well, but not the loss of his friend: he would say, and that though he
knew it, Vansquisque si^^ fortune ^ober, was a true and good principle, yet the
most in number were those that marred themselves, but I will never forgive that
man, that loses himself, to be rid of his jest.

He was Father to that refined wit, which since has acted a disasterous part,
on the public stage, and of late, sat in his Fathers room, as Lord
Chancellor; those that lived in his age, and from whence I have taken this
little model of him, gives him a lively Character, and they decipher him, for
another Solo^, and the Synon of those times, such a one as Aedipus was in
dissolving of riddles; doubtless, he was as able an instrument, and it was his
commendation, that his-head was the Mawle (for it was a great one,) and therein
he kept the Wedge, that entered the knotty pieces, that came to the Table: and
now I must again fall back, to smooth, and plain away to the rest that is
behind, but not from the purpose.

There were about these times, two Rivals in the Queens favor, old Sir Francis
Knowles, Controuller of the House, and Sir Henry Norris, whom she called up at
a Parliament to sit with the Peers in the higher House, as Lord Norris of
R^cott, who had married the Daughter and Heir of the old Lord Williams of Tain,
a Noble person, and to whom in the Queens adversity, she had been committed to
safe custody, and from him had received, more then ordinary observances. Now
such was the goodness of the Queens nature, that she neither forgot the good
turns received from the Lord Williams, neither was she unmindefull of this Lord
Norris, whose Father, in her Fathers time, and in the business of her mother
dyed in a noble cause, and in the jnstification of her innocence.

Lord Norris.
MY Lord Norris had by this Lady an ample issue, which the Queen highly
respected, for he had six sons, and all Martial brave men, the first was
William his eldest, and Father to the late Earl of Bark-shire, Sir John,
Vulgarly called, General Norris, Sir Edward, Sir Thomas, Sir Henry, and
Maximilian, men of an haughty courage, and of great experience in the conduct
of Millitary affairs, and to speak in the Character of their merit, they were
such persons of such renown, and worth, as future times must out of duty, owe
them the debt of an honorable memory.

Knowles.
SIR Francis Knowles, was somewhat of the Queens affinity, and had likewise no
incompetent issue, for he had also William his Eldest, and since Earl of
Banbury, Sir Thomas, Sir Robert, and Sir Francis, if I be not a little mistaken
in their names, and Marshalling; and there was also the Lady Lettice, a Sister
of these, who was first Countess of Essex, and after of Leicester, and these
were also brave men in their times, and places; but they were of the Court, and
Carpet, not led by the genious of the Camp.

Between these two Families, there was (as it falls out amongst great Ones,
and Competitors for favor) no great correspondency, and there were some Seeds,
either of emulation, or distrust, cast between them, which had they not been
disjoined in the residence of of their persons, (as it was the Fortune of their
employments) the one side attending the Court, the other the Pavillion,

Surely, they would have broken out into some kind of hostility* or at least
they would have wrastled one in the other, like Trees, incircled with joy, for
there was a time when (both these Fraternities being met at Court:) there
passed a challenge between them at certain exercises (the Queen and the old men
being Spectators) which ended in a flat quarrel amongst them all) and I am
persuaded (though I ought not to judge) that there were some relics of this
fewd, that were long after the causes of the one Families (almost utter)
extirpation, and of the others improsperity: for it was a known truth, that so
long as my Lord of Leicester lived, who was the main Pillar of the one side, as
having married the Sister, none of the other side took any deep rooting in the
Court: though otherwise they made their ways to honor by their swords, and
that which is of more note (considering my Lord of Leicesters use of men of
Arms, being shortly after sent Governor to the revolted States, and no
Soldier himself) is that, he made no more account of Sir John Norris, a
Soldier then deservedly famoused, and trained from a Page, under the
discipline of the great Captain of Christendom, the ^dmirall Castillion, and
of command in the French, and Dutch War^es, almost twenty years. It is of
further observation, that my Lord of Essex (after Leicesters decease) though
initated to Arms, and honored by the General, in the Portug^ll expedition:
whether out of instigation (as it has been thought) or out of ambition and
jealousy, to be ecclipsed, and over shadowed by the fame and splendour of this
great Commander, loved him not in sincerity. Moreover, certain it is, he not
only crushed, and (upon all occasions) queld the growth of this brave man, and
his famous Brethren, but therewith drew on his own fatal end, by undertaking
the Irish Action; in a time when he left the Court, empty of friends, and full
fraught with his professed enemies: but I forbear to extend my self in any
further relation upon this Subject, as having left some notes of truth, in
these two noble Families, which I would present, and therewith touched somewhat,
which I would not, if the equity of the Narration would have admitted an
inte^mission.

Sir John Perrot.
SIR John Perrot was a goodly Gentleman, and of the sword, and as he was of a
very ancient descent, as an heir to many abstracts of gentry, especially from
Guy de Bryan of Lawhern, so was he of a vast estate, and came not to the Court
for want, and to these adjuncts, he had the endowments of courage, and height
of spirit, had it lighted on the allay of temper, and discretion the defect,
whereof, with a native freedom, and boldness of speech, drew him on to a
clouded setting, and laid him open to the spleen and advantage of his enemies,
amongst whom Sir Christopher Hatton was professed. He was yet a wise man, and a
brave Courtier, but rough, and participating more of active then sedentary
motions, as being in his constellation destinated for Arms. There is a quere
of some denotations, how he came to receive his foyl, and that in the
Catastrophe, for he was strengthened with honorable allyances and the privy
friendships of the Court.

My Lord of Leicester and Burleigh, (both his contemporaries and familiars. But
that there might be (as the Adage has it) falsity in friendship, and we may
rest satisfied, that there is no dispute against fate.

They quote him, for a person that loved too stand to much alone, and on his
own legs, of too often recesses, and discontinuance from the Queens presence, a
fault which is incompetible with the ways of Court and favor.

He was sent Lord Deputy into Ireland, (as it was thought) for a kind of
haughtiness of spirit, and repugnancy in Councels: or as others have thought,
the fittest person, then to bridle the insolency of the Irish, and probable it
is, that both these (considering the sway) that he would have at the board, and
head in the Queens) concurred, and did a little conspire his remove, and his
ruin. But into Ireland he went, where he did the Queen very great and many
services, if the surplusage of the measure did not abate the value of the
merit, as after times found that to be no Paradox, for to save the Queens purse
(which both her self) and my Lord Treasurer Burleigh ever took for good
services) he imposed on the Irish the charge of bearing their own arms, which
both gave them the possession, and taught them the use of weapons, which proved
in the end a most fatal work, both in the profusion of blood and treasure.

But at his return, and on some account sent home before, touching the state of
the Kingdom, the assiduous testimonies of her grace toward him, till by his
retreat to his Castle at Ca^y, where he was then building, and out of desire to
be in command at home (as he had been abroad) together with the hatred and
practice of Hatton, then in high favor, whom not long before, he had too
bitterly tanted for his dancing, he was accused of high Treason, and for high
words, and a forged letter condemned, though the Queen, on the news of his
condemnation, swore by her wonted oath, that they were all knaves; and they
deliver with assurance, that on his return to the Tower, after his Trial, he
said in oaths, and in fury, to the Lieuteuant Sir Owen Hop^on, what will the
Queen suffer her Brother to be offered up, as a Sacrifice to the envy of my
frisking adversaries; which being made known to the Queen, and the warrant for
his execution tendered, and somewhat enforced, she refused to sign it, and
swore he should not dye, for he was an honest, and a faithful man: and surely,
though not altogether to set up our rest, and faith upon tradition, and upon
old reports, as that Sir Thomas Perrot his Father was a Gentleman of the privy
Chamber, to Henry the eigth, and in the Court married to a Lady of great
honor, of the Kings familiarity, which are presumptions of some implication:
But if we go a little further, and compare his Picture, his qualities, gesture,
and voice, with that of the Kings, which memory retains, yet amongst us, they
will plead strongly, that he was a subreptious child of the blood Royal.

Certain it is, that he lived not long in the Tower, and that after his
decease, Sir Thomas Perrot his son (then of no mean esteem with the Queen)
having before married my Lord of Essex Sister, since Countess of
Northumberland, had restitution of all his Lands, though after his decease also
(which immediately followed) the Crown resumed his estate, and took advantage
of the former attainder. And to say the truth, the Priests forged letter, was
at his arraignment, thought but as a fiction of envy, and was soon after
exploded by the Priests own confession, but that which most exasperated the
Queen, and gave advantage to his enemies, was (as Sir Walter Rawleigh takes
into his observation) words of disdain, for the Queen by sharp and reprehensive
Letters, had nettled him, and shortly after sending others of approbation,
commending his service, and intimating an invasion from Spain, which he no
sooner perused, but he said publicly in the great Chamber at Dublin: Lo now
she is ready to piss her self for fear of the Spaniard; I am again one of her
white Boys.

Words which are subject to a various construction, and tended to some
disreputation of his Sovereign, and such as may serve for instruction to
persons in place of honor, and command to beware of the violences of nature,
but especially of the exorbitances of the tongue: and so I conclude him with
this double observation, the one of the innocence of his intentions (exempt and
clear from the guilt of Treason) and disloyalty, the other of the greatness of
his heart, for at his arraignment he was so little dejected, by what might be
alleged and proved against him, that he rather grew troubled with choler, and
in a kind of exaspiration despised his Jury, though of the order of
Knighthood, and of the special Gentry, claiming the privilege of trial, by
the Peers, and Barronage of the Realm, so prevalent was that of his native
genious, and the haughtiness of his spirit, which accompanied him to his last,
and till (any diminution of courage) it brake in pieces, the cords of his
magnanimity, for he dyed suddenly in the Tower, and when it was thought the
Queen did intend his enlargement, with the restitution of his possessions,
which were then very great, and comparable to most of the Nobility.

Hattor.
SIR Chrystopher Hatton came into the Court, as his opposite, Sir John Perrot
was wont to say, by the Galliard, for he came thither as a private Gentleman of
the Innes of Court in a Mask, and for his activity, and person, which was tall,
and proportionable, taken into her favor, he was first made vice Chamberlain,
and shortly afterward advanced to the place of Lord Chancellor; a Gentleman
that besides the graces of his person, and dancing, had also the adjectaments
of a strong and subtle capacity, one that could soon learn the discipline and
garb, both of the times and Court, the truth is, he had a large proportion of
gifts, and endowments, but too much of the season of envy, and he was a mere
vegetable of the Court, that sprung up at night, and sunk again at his noon.

Lord Effingham.
MY Lord of Effingham, though a Courtier betimes, yet I find not, that the
Sunshine of her favor, broke out upon him, until she took him into the Ship,
and made him high Admiral of England, for his extract, it may suffice that he
was the son of a Howard, and of a Duke of Norfolk.

And for his person, as goodly a Gentleman, as the times had any, if nature had
not been more intentive to complete his person, then Fortune to make him rich,
for the times considered which were then active, and a long time after
lucrative, he dyed not wealthy, yet the honester man, though it seems the
Queens purpose was to tender the occasion of his advancement, and to make him
capable of more honor, which at his return from Cadize accounts, she conferred
it upon him, creating him Earl of Nottingham, to the great discontent of his
Colleague, my Lord of Essex, who then grew accessive in the Appetite of her
favor, and the truth was so exorbitant in the limitation of the Sovereign
aspect, that it much alienated the Queens grace from him, and drew others
together with the Admiral, to a combination, and to conspire his ruin: and
though I have heard it from that party (I mean of the Admiralls faction) that
it lay not in his proper power to hurt my Lord of Essex, yet he had more
followers, and such as were well skilled in setting of the Gynne, but I leave
this, to these of an other age.

It is out of doubt, that the Admiral was a good honest, and a brave man, and
a faithful servant to his Mistress, and such a one as the Queen out of her own
Princely judgment, knew to be a fit instrument for that service, for she was
no ill proficient in the reading of men, as well as Books, and his sundry
expeditions, as that before mentioned, and 88. does both express his worth, and
manifest the Queens trust, and the opinion she had of his fidelity, and conduct.

Moreover, the Howards were of the Queens alliance, and consanguinity by her
mother, which swayed her affection; and bent it toward this great house, and it
was a part of her natural propension, to grace and support ancient nobility,
where it did not entrench, neither invade her interest, for on such trespasses
she was quick and tender, and would not spare any whatsoever, as we may observe
in the case of the Duke, and my Lord of Hereford, whom she much favored, and
countenanced, till they attempted the forbidden fruit, the fault of the last,
being in the severest interpretation, but a trespass of incroachment, but in
the first it was taken for a riot against the Crown, and her own Sovereign
power, and as I have ever thought, the cause of her aversion against the rest
of the house, and the Dukes great Father in Law Fitz Allen, Earl of Arundell, a
person of the first rank in her affections before these, and some other
jealousies made a separation between them, this noble Lord, and the Lord Thomas
Howard, since Earl of Suffolk, standing alone in her grace, the rest in umbrage.

Sir John Packington.
SIR John Packington was a Gentleman of no mean family, and of form and
feature, no way dispiseable, for he was a brave Gentleman, and a very fine
Courtier, and for the time which he stayed there, (which was not lasting) very
high in her grace, but he came in, and went out, and thorough disassiduity drew
the Curtain between himself and the light of her grace, and then death
overwhelmed the remnant, and utterly deprived him of recovery, and they say of
him, that had he brought less to the Court then he did, he might have carried
away more then he brought, for he had a time on it, but an ill husband of
opportunity.

Lord Hunsdon.
MY Lord of Hunsdon was of the Queens nearest Kindred, and on the decease of
Sussex, both he, and his son took the place of Lord Chamberlain, he was a
fast man to his Prince, and firm in his friends and servants, and though he
might speak big, and therein would be born out, yet was he not the more
dreadful, but less harmfull, and far from the practice of my Lord of
Leicesters instructions, for he was down right, and I have heard those that
both knew him well, and had interest in him, say merrily of him, that his
Latin, and his dissimulation were both alike, and that his custom of
swearing, and obscenity in speaking, made him seem a worse Christian then he
was, and a better Knight of the Carpet, then he should be, as he lived in a
ruffling time, so he loved sword and buckler men, and such as our Fathers were
wont to call men of their hands, of which sort, he had many brave Gentleman
that followed him, yet not taken for a popular and dangerous person, and this
is one that stood amongst the Togati, of an honest stout heart, and such a one
(as upon occasion) would have fought for his Prince; and his Country, for he
had the charge of the Queens person, both in the Court, and in the Camp at
Tilbury.

Rawleigh.
SIR Walter Rawleigh was on that (it seems) fortune had picked out of purpose,
of whom to make an example, o^ to use as her Tennis-Ball, thereby to show what
she could do, for she tossed him up of nothing, and to and fro to greatness, and
from thence down to little more, then to that wherein she found him (a bare
Gentleman) not that he was less, for he was well descended, and of good
alliance, but poor in his beginnings; and for my Lord of Oxfords jest of him
(the Jack, and an upstart) we all know, it savours more of emulation, and his
humor, then of truth, and it is a certain note of the times, that the Queen in
her choice, never took into her favor a mere new man, or a Mechanic, as
Commes observes of Lewis the eleventh of (...), who did serve himself with
persons of unknown Parents, such as was Oliv^r the Barber, whom he created Earl
of D^^^yes, and made him ^x secretis consilus, and alone in his favor,
familiarity: his approaches to the University, and Innes of Court were the
grounds of his improvement, but they were rather excursions, then sieges, or
settings down, for he stayed not long in a place, and being the youngest
brother, and the house diminished in Patrimony, he foresaw his own destiny that
he was first to roll (through want and disabil^ty, to subsist otherwise)
before he could come to a repose, and as the stone does by long lying, gather
moss: he first exposed himself to the Land service of Ireland, (a (...)) which
then did not yield him food and raiment, (for it was ever very poor) nor had
he patience to stay there, (though shortly after he came thither again) under
the command of my Lord Gray* but with his own Colors flying in the field,
having in the interim cast a new chance, both in the Low Countries, and in a
voyage to Sea; and if ever man drew virtue out of necessity, it was he,
therewith was he the great example of industry, and though he might then have
taken that of the Merchant to himself, (...) mar^* p^r terras, curr^t me^c^tor
ad Indos, He might also have said, and truly with the Philosopher, Omnia mea
mecum porto: For it was a long time before he could brag of more then he
carried at his back, and when he got on the winning side, it was his
commendation, that he took pains for it, and underwent many various adventures
for his after perfection, and before he came into the public note of the
world: and it may appear how he came up (per ardua) Per varios casus per t^^
(...) re^unt* not pulled up by chance, or by any gentle admittance of Fortune,
I will briefly describe his native parts, and those of his own acquiring, which
were the hopes of his rising.

He had in the outward man, a good presence, in a handsome and well compacted
person, a strong natural wit, and a better judgment, with a bold, and
plausable tongue, whereby he could set out his parts to the best advantage, and
to these he had the a^juncts of some general learning, which by diligence he
enforced to a great augmentation, and perfection; for he was an indefatigable
Reader, whether by Sea or Land, and none of the least observers both of men,
and the times, and I am confident, that among the second causes, of his grouth,
that variance between him, and my Lord Gray, in his descent into ^^lan^, was a
principal, for it drew them both over to the Council Table, there to plead
their cause, where (what advantage he had in the cause I know not) but he had
much the better, in the telling of his tale, and so much, that the Queen and
the Lords, took no slight mark of the man, and his parts, for from thence he
came to be known, and to have a cesse to the Queen, and the Lords, and then we
are not to doubt how such a man would comply, and learn the way of progression,
and whether or no my Lord of Leicester had then cast in a good for him, to the
Queen which would have done no harm, I do not determine: but true it is, he
had gotten the Queens ear at a trice, and she began to be taken with his
elocution, and loved to hear his reasons, to her demands, and the truth is she
took him for a kind of Oracle, which nettled them all, yea those that he
relied on, began to take this his sudden favor for an Allarum, and to be
sensible of their own supplantation, and to project his, which made him shortly
after sing, Fortune my so, etc. So that finding his favor declining, and
falling into a recesse, he undertook a new perigrination to leave that Ter^a
i^firma of the Court, for that of the Wars, and by declining himself, and by
absence to expel his, and the passion of his enemies, which in Court, was a
strange device of recovery, but that he knew, there was some ill office done
him, that he durst not attempt to mind any other ways, then by going aside,
thereby to teach envy a new way of forgetfulness, and not so much as to think
of him, howsoever he had it always in mind never to forget himself, and his
device took so well, that at his return he came in (as Rams do, by going
backward) with the greater strength, and so continued to her last, great in her
grace, and Captain of the Guard, where I must leave him, but with this
observation, that though he gained much at the Court, yet he took it not out of
the Exchequer, or merely out of the Queens purse, but by his wit, and the help
of the Prerogative, for the Queen was never profuse in the delivering out of
her treasure, but paid many, and most of her servants part in money, and the
rest with grace, which as the case stood, was taken for good payment, leaving
the arreare of recompense due to their merit, to her great Successor, who paid
them all with advantage.

Grevill.
SIR Faulk Grevill, since Lord Brook, had no mean place in her favor, neither
did he hold it for any short term, for if I be not deceived, he had the
longest lease, and the smoothest time without rub of any of her Favorits; he
came to the Court in his youth and prime, or that is the time or never, he was
a brave Gentleman, and honorably descended from Willoughby Lord Brook, and
Admiral to Henry the 7. neither illiterate, for he was, as he would often
profess a friend to Sir Philip Syd^ey, and there are of his now extant some
fragments of his poem, and of those times, which do interest him in the Muses,
and which shows, the Queens election had ever a noble conduct, and it motions
more of virtue and judgment, then of fancy. I find that he neither sought
for, or obtained any great place or preferment in Court, during all the time of
his attendance, neither did he need it, for he came thither backed with a
plentiful Fortune, which as himself was wont to say, was the better held
together by a single life, wherein he lived and dyed a constant Courtier of the
Ladies.

Essex.
MY Lord of Essex (as Sir Henry Wotton a Gentleman of great parts, and partly
of his times, and retinue observes) had his introduction by my Lord of
Leicester, who had married his mother, a tie of affinity, which besides a more
urgent obligation might have invited his care to advance him, his fortune being
then (and through his Fathers infelicity) grown low; but that the son of a
Lord Ferrers of Charley, Viscount Hartford, and Earl of Essex (who was of the
ancient Nobility) and formerly in the Queens good grace, could not have a room
in her favor, without the assistance of Leicester, was beyond the rule of her
nature, which as I have elsewhere taken into observation, was ever inclineable
to favor the nobility: sure it is, that he no sooner appeared in Court, but he
took with the Queen and Courtiers, and I believe they all could not choose, but
look thorough the Sacrifice of the Father, on his living son, whose Image by
the remembrance of former passages, was a fresh, (like the bleeding of men
murdered) represented to the Court, and offered up as a Subject of compassion
to all the Kingdom. There was in this young Lord together with a most goodly
person, a kind of urbanity, or innate courtesy, which both won the Queen,
and too much took upon the people, to gaze upon the new adopted son of her
favor: and as I go along, it were not amiss to take into observation too
notable quotations: the first was a violent indulgency of the Queen, (which
incident to old age, where it encounters with a pleasing and suitable object)
toward this Lord, all which argued a none perpetuity, the second was a fault
in the object of her grace; my Lord himself, who drew in too fast, like a
child sucking on an over uberous Nurse, and had there been a more decent
decorum observed in both, or either of those, without doubt, the unity of their
affections, had been more permanent, and not so in and out as they were, like
an instrument ill tuned, and lapsing to discord.

The greater error of the two (though unwillingly) I am constrained to impose
on my Lord of Essex, or rather on his youth, and none of the least of his
blame, on those that stood Sentinels about him, who might have advised him
better, but that like men intoxicated with hopes, they likewise had sucked in
with the most, and of their Lords receipt, and so like Caesar's would have all
or none, a rule quite contrary to nature, and the most indulgent parents, who
though they may express more affection to one in the abundance of bequests:
yet cannot forget some Legacies, just distributives, and dividents to others,
of their begetting; and how hateful partiallity proves, every days experience
tells us, out of which common consideration might have framed to their hands a
maxim of more discretion for the conduct and management of their now graced
Lord and Master.

But to omit that of infusion, and to do right to truth, my Lord of Ess^x (even
of those that truly loved and honored him, was noted for too bold an
ingrosser, both of fame and favor, and of this (without offense to the living,
or treading on the sacred urne of the dead) I shall present a truth, and a
passage yet in memory.

My Lord Mou^^^^y (who was another child of her favor) being newly come to
Court, and then but Sir Charles ^luns (for my Lord William his Elder Brother,
was then living) had the good fortune one day to run very well a Tilt, and
the Queen therewith was so well pleased, that she sent him in token of her
favor, a Queen at Chesse of gold richly ennameled, which his servants had the
next day fastened on his Arm, with a Crymson ribband, which my Lord of Essex as
he passed through the Privy Chamber, espying, with his cloak cast under his
Arm, the better to commend it to the view, enquired what it was, and for what
cause there fixed, Sir Foulk Grevill told him, that it was the Queens favor,
which the day before, and after the Tilting she had sent him, whereat my Lord
of Essex in a kind of emulation, and as though he would have limited her
favor, said now I perceive, every fool must have a favor, This bitter and
publicly affront, came to Sir Charles Blu^ts ear, who sent him a challenge,
which was accepted by my Lord, and they met near Marrybone Park, where my Lord
was hurt in the thigh, and disarmed; the Queen missing the men, was very
curious to learn the truth, and when at last, it was whispered out, she swore
by Gods death, it was fit that some one or other should take him down, and
teach him better manners, otherwise there would be no rule with him: and here I
note the innition of my Lords friendship, with Mount^oy, which the Queen her
self did then conjure.

Now for fame, we need not go far, for my Lord of Essex having borne a grudge
to General Norris, who had (unwittingly) offered to undertake the action of
Britain with fewer men, then my Lord had before demanded, on his return with
victory, and a glorious report of his valor, he was then thought the only man
for the Irish War, wherein my Lord of Essex so wrought, by despising the
number, and quality of Rebels, that Norris was sent over with a scanted force,
joined with the relics of the veterane Troops of Britain, of set purpose (as
it fell out) ^o ruin Norris, and the Lord Bu^rows, by my Lords procurement
sent* ^his heels, and to command in chief, and to confine Norris only to his
Government at Munser, which brake the great heart of the General, to see
himself undervalued, and undermined by my Lord and Burrows, which was as the
Proverb speaks it, Imberbes docere senes.

My Lord Burrows, in the beginning of his persecution dyed, whereupon the Queen
was fully bent to have sent over Mountioy, which my Lord of Essex utterly
disliked, and opposed with many reasons, and by arguments of contempt against
Mountioy, his then professed friend and familiar, so predominant were his
words, to reap the honor of closing up that War, and all other.

Now the way being opened and plained by his own Workmanship, and so handled
that none durst appear to stand for the place, at last, with much ado, he
obtained his own ends, and vvithall his fatal destruction, leaving the Queen
and the Court (where he stood firm, and impregnable in her grace) to men that
long had sought, and vvatcht their times to give him the trip, and could never
find any opportunity, but this of his absence, and of his own creation, and
these are the true observations of his Appetite, and inclinations, which were
not of any true proportion, but carried and transported with an over desire,
and thi^stines after fame, and that deceitful fame of popularity, and to help
on his Catastrophe: I observe likewise two sorts of people, that had a hand
in his fall, the first was the Soldiery, which all flockt unto him, as
foretelling a mortality, and are commonly of blunt, and too rough Counsels,
and many times dissonant from the time of the Court, and the State; the other
sort were of his family, his servants, and his own creatures, such as were
bound by the rules of safety, and obligations of fidelity to have looked better
to the steering of that Boat, wherein they themselves were carried, and not
have suffered it to float and run on ground, with those empty Sails of Fame
and Tumor of popular applause, me thinks one honest man or other, that had but
the office of brushing his clothes, might have whispered in his ear, my Lord
look to it, this multitude that follows you, will either devour you, or undo
you; strive not to rule, and over rule all, for it will cost hot water, and it
will procure envy, and if needs your genius must have it so, let the Court, and
the Queens presence, be your station: but as I have said, they had sucked too
much of their Lords milk, and instead of withdrawing, they blew the Coals of
his ambition, and infused into him too much of the Spirit of glory: yea, and
mixed the goodness of his nature with a touch of revenge, which is ever
accompanied with a destiny of the same fate, and of this number there were some
of insufferable natures about him, that towar is his last, gave desperate
advice, such as his integrity abhorred, and his fidelity forbad, amongst whom
Sir Henry ^ott^n notes (without injury) his Secretary Cuffe, a vileman, and of
a perverse nature, I could also name others, that when he was in the right
course of recovery, and settling to moderation, would not suffer a recesse in
him, but stirred up the dregs of those rude humors, which by time, and his
affliction, out of his own judgment he sought to repose, or to give them all a
vomit: and thus I conclude this noble Lord, as a mixture between prosperity,
and adversity, once the child of his great Mistress favor, but the son of
Bellona.

Buckhurst.
MY Lord of Buckhurst, was of the noble House of the Sackvills, and of the
Queens consanguinity, his Father was Sir Richard Sackvill, or as the people
then called him, Fill-sack, by reason of his great wealth, and the vast
Patrimony which he left to this his son, whereof he spent in his youth the
best part, until the Queen by her frequent admonitions diverted the torrent of
his profusion, he was a very fine Gentleman of person, and indowments both of
art and nature, both without measure magnificient, till on the turn of his
humor, and the allay that his years, and good Counsels had wrought upon those
immoderate courses of his youth, and that height of spirit, inherent to his
House: and then did the Queen as a most juditious, and indulgent Prince, when
she saw the man, grow stayed, and settled, give him her assistance, and
advanced him to the Treasureship, where he made amends to his house, for his
misspent time, both in the increasment of estate and honor, which the Queen
conferred on him, together with the opportunity to remake himself, and thereby
to show that this was a child, that should have a share in her grace, and a
taste of her bounty. They much commend his elocution, but more the excellency
of his pen, for he was a Scholar, and a person of a quick dispatch (faculties,
that yet run in the blood) and they say of him, that his Secretaries did
little for him, by the way of indictment, wherein they could seldom please
him, he was so facet and choice in his phrase, and style, and for his
dispatches, and the content he gave to Suitors, he had a decorum seldom since
put in practice; for he had of his attendants that took into roll, the names of
all Suitors, with the date of their first adresses, and these in their order
had hearing, so that a fresh man, could not leap over his head, that was of a
more ancient edition, except in the urgent affairs of State. I find not that
he was any ways ensnared in the factions of the Court, which were all his
times strong, and in every man's note the Howards and the ^^cills of the one
part, my Lord of Essex, etc on the other part, for he held the Staff of the
Treasury fast in his hand, which once in the year made then all beholding to
him, and the truth is (as he was a wise man, and a stout) he had no reason to
be a partaker: for he stood sure in blood, and in grace, and was wholly
intentive to the Queens service, and such were his abilities, that she received
assiduous proofs of his sufficiency, and it has been thought, that she might
have more cunning instruments, but none of a more strong judgment and
confidence in his ways, which are symptoms of magnanimity and fidelity,
whereunto methinks this Motto has some kind of reference, aut nunq iam tents
aut perfice. As though he would have charactered in a word the Genius of his
House, or expressed somewhat of an higher inclination, then lay within his
compass, That he was a Courtier, is apparent, for he stood always in her eye
and favor.

Lord Mountjoy.
MY Lord Mountioy was of the ancient Nobility, but utterly deceived in the
support thereof, Patrimony, through his Grandfathers excess in the action of
Bullen, his Fathers vanity in the search of the Philosophers stone, and his
Brothers untimely prodigalities, all which seemed by a joint conspiracy to
ruin the house, and altogether to annihilate it: as he came from Oxford, he
took tho Inner Temple in his way to Court, whither no sooner came, but (without
asking) he had a pretty strange kind of admission, which I have heard from a
discreet man, of his own, and much more of the secrets of those times, he was
then much about twenty years of age, of a Brown-hair, a sweet face, a most neat
Composure, and tall in his person, the Queen was then at White Hall, and at
dinner, whither he came to see the fashion of the Court the Queen had soon
found him out, and with a kind of an affected frown, asked the Lady Car^er
what he was, she answered she knew him not, insomuch as an inquiry was made
from one to another, who he might be, till at length, it was told the Queen, he
was Brother to the Lord William Mountioy, this inquisition with the eye of
Majesty fixed upon him, (as she was wont to do, and to dant men she knew not)
stirred the blood of this young Gentleman, insomuch as his color came and
went, which the Queen observing, called him unto her, and gave him her hand to
kiss, encouraging him with gracious words, and new looks, and so diverting her
speech to the Lords, and Ladies, She said, that she no sooner observed him, but
that she knew there was in him some noble Blood, with some other expressions of
pity toward his House, and then again demanding his name, She said, fail you
not to come to the Court, and I will be think my self how to do you good; and
this was his inlet, and the beginnings of his grace, where it falls into
confideration, that though he wanted not wit and courage, for he had very fine
atractions, and being a good piece of a Scholar, yet were they accompanied
with the retractives of bashfulness, and a natural modesty (which as the toan
of his house, and the ebb of his fortune then stood, might have hindered his
progression, had they not been reinforced* by the infusion of Sovereign favor,
and the Queens gracious invitation. And that it may appear how low he was, and
how much that heretic necessity, will work in the dejection of good spirits,
I can deliver it with assurance, that his exhibition was very scant until his
Brother dyed, which was shortly after his admission to the Court, and then was
it no more then a thousand Marks ^er annum, wherewith he lived plentifully in a
fine way and garb, and without any great sustentation, during all her times,
and as there was in his nature a kind of backwardness, which did not befriend
him, nor suite with the motion of the Court, so there was in him an inc^ination
to Arms, with a humor of traveling, and gadding abroad, which had not some
wise men about him labored to remove, and the Queen her self laid in her
commands, he would (out of his natural propension) have marred his own market,
for as he was grown by reading (whereunto he was much adicted) to the theory of
a Soldier, so was he strongly invicted by his genius, to the acquaintance of
the practique of the War, which were the causes of his excursions, for he had
a Company in the Low Countries, from whence he came over with a Noble
acceptance of the Queen, but somewhat restless, in honorable thoughts he
exposed himself again, and again, and would press the Queen with the pretenses
of visiting his Company so often, that at length he had a flat denial, and yet
he stole over with Sir John Norris, into the action of Britain, (which was then
a hot and active War) whom he would always call his Father, honoring him
above all men, and ever bewayling his end, so contrary he was in his esteem,
and valuation of this great Commander to that of his friend, my Lord of Essex,
till at last the Queen began to take his decessions for contempts, and confined
his residence to the Court, and her own presence, and upon my Lord of Essex
fall (so confident she was in her own Princely judgment, and opinion she had
conceived of his worth and conduct) that she would have this noble Gentleman,
and none other, to finish, and bring the Irish War to a propitious end: for
it was a prophetical speech of her own, that it would be his fortune, and
his honor to cut the thread of that fatal rebellion, and to bring her in peace
to the grave, where she was not deceived, for he achieved it, but with much
pains, and carfulness, and not without the fears, and many jealousies of the
Court, and times, vvherevvith the Queens age, and the malignity of her setting
times were repleat, and so I come to his dear friend in Court, Master
Secretary Cecill, whom in his long absence from Court, he adored as his Saint,
and Courted for his only Mecenas, both before and after his departure from
Court, and during all the times of his command in Ireland, well knovving that
it lay in his power, and by a word of his mouth to make or mar him.

Cecill.
SIR Robert Cecill, since Earl of Salisbury, was the son of the Lord
Burleigh and in the inheritor of his wisdom, and by degrees, Successor of
his places and favors, though not of his Lands, for he had Sir Thomas Cecill
his elder brother, since created Earl of Exete^, he was first Secretary of
State, then Master of the Wards, and in the last of her reign came to be Lord
Treasurer, all which were the steps of his Fathers greatness, and of the
honor he left to his House. For his person he was not much beholding to
nature, though somevvhat for his face, which was the best part of his
outside, but for his inside, it may be said, and without soloecisme, that he
was his Fathers own son, and a pregnant proficient in all discipline of
State: He was a Courtier from his Cradle, (which might have made him betimes)
yet at the age of twenty and upvvards (he was much short of his after proof,
but exposed, and by change of climate he soon made shovv, what he was, and
would be, he lived in those times wherein the Queen had most need, and use of
men of weight, and amongst able ones, this was a chief, as having his
sufficiency from his instructions that begat him, the tutorship of the times,
and Court, which were then the Academies of Art and cunning, for such was the
Queens condition from the tenth or twelfth of her reign, that she had the
happiness to stand up (whereof there is a former intimation) though environed
with more enemies, and assaulted with more dangerous practices, then any Prince
of her times, and of many ages before, neither must we in this her preservation
attribute to much to humane pollices, for that God in his omnipotent
providence, had not only ordained those secundary means as instruments of the
work, but by an evident manifestation, that the same work which she acted, was
a well pleasing service of his own, out of a peculiar care had decreed the
protection of the work-Mistris, and thereunto added his abundant blessing upon
all, and whatsoever she undertook, which is an observation of satisfaction to
my self, that she was in the right, though to others now breathing under the
same form, and frame of her Government, it may not seem an animadversion of any
worth, but I leave them to the peril of their own folly. And so again to this
great Master of State, and the staff of the Queens declinning age, who though
his little crooked person could not promise any great supportation, yet it
carried thereon a head, and a headpeece of a vast content, and therein it seems
nature was so diligent to complete one, and the best part about him, as that to
the perfection of his memory, and intellectualls, she took care also of his
senses, and to put him in (...) oculos, or to pleasure him the more borrowed of
Argns so to give unto him a prospective sight, and for the rest of his
sensitive virtues, his predecessor Walsingham had left him a receipt, to smell
out what was done in the conclave, and his good old Father, was so well seen in
the Mathematickes, as that he could tell you throughout all Spain, every part,
every Ship, with their burdens, whither bound with preparation, what
impediments for diversion, of enterprises, Counsels, and resolutions, and that
we may see (as in a little Map) how docible this little man was; I will present
a taste of his abilities. My Lord of Devonshir^ (upon the certainty the
Spaniard would invade Ireland with a strong Army) had written very earnestly to
the Queen and the Council, for such supplies to be timely sent over, that
might enable him to march up to the Spaniard, if he did land, and follow on his
prosecution against the Rebels. Sir Robert Cecill, (besides the general
dispatch of the Council, as he often did) Wrote this in private, for these two
began then to love dearly.

My Lord, Out of the abundance of my affection, and the care I have of your
well doing, I must in private put you out of doubt, (for I fear, I know you
cannot be otherwise sensible then in the way of honor) that the Spaniard will
not come unto you this year, for I have it from my own, what preparations are
in all his parts, and what he can do, for be confident, he bears up a
reputation by seeming to embrace more then he can gripe, but the next year be
assured he will cast over unto you, some forelorne hopes, which how they may be
reinforced beyond his present ability, and his first intention, I cannot, as
yet make any certain judgment; but I believe out of my intelligence, that you
may expect their landing in Munster, and the more to distract you, in several
places, as at Kings-Sail, Beer-haven, Baltimore, where you may be sure (coming
from Se^) they will first fortify, and learn the strength of the Rebels,
before they dare take the field, howsoever (as I know you will not) lessen your
care, neither your defenses, and whatsoever lies within my power to do you, and
the public service, rest thereof assured.

And to this I would ad much more, but it may (as it is) suffice to present
much, as his abilities in the pen, that he was his crafts Master in foreign
intelligence, and for domestique affairs, as he was one of those that sat at
the stern to the last of the Queen, so was he none of the least in skill, and
in the true use of the Compass, and so I shall only vindicate the scandal of
his death, and conclude him, for he departed at Saint Margarets near
Marl^borough, in his return from the Bath, as my Lord Viscount Cranborne, my
Lord Clifford his Son, and Son in Law, my self, and many more can witness,
but that the day before he sounded in the way, was taken out of the Litter,
and laid into his Coach, was a truth, out of which that falsehood, concerning
the manner of his death, had its derivation, though nothing to the purpose, or
to the prejudice of his vvorth.

Vere.
SIR Francis Vere was of the ancient, and the most noble extract of the Earls
of Oxford, and it may be a question, whether the nobility of his house, or the
honor of his achievements, might most commend him, but that we have an
authentic rule to decide the doubt, Nam genus and proavos, and quae non
^ecimus ipsi Vix^a nostra voco. For though he were an honorable slip of that
ancient Tree of nobility (which was no disadvantage to his virtue) yet he
brought more glory to the name of Vere then he took of Blood, from the Family.
He was amongst the Queens svvord-men, inferior to none, but superior to
many, of whom it may be said, to speak much of him, were the way to leave
out something that might add to his praise, and to forget more that could add
to his honor. I find not, that he came much to the Court, for he lived almost
perpetually in the Camp, but when he did, no man had more of the Queens
favor, and none less envyed, for he seldom troubled it with the jealousy
and allarums of supplantation, his way was another sort of undermining, they
report that the Queen (as she loved Martial men) would Court this Gentleman,
as soon as he appeared in her presence, and surely he was a Soldier of great
worth, and commanded thirty years in the service of the States, and twenty
years, over the English in chief, as the Queens General, and he that had seen
the battle of Newport might there best have taken him, and his noble Brother,
my Lord of Tilbury to the life.

Worces^er.
MY Lord of Worcester I have here put last, but not least in the Queens favor,
he was of the ancient and noble Blood of the (...), and of her Grandfathers
line, by the Mother, which the Queen could never forget, especially where there
was a concunency of old Blood with fidelity, a mixture which ever sorted with
the Queens nature, and though there might appear something in this House, which
might avert her grace, (though not to speak of my Lord himself, but with due
reverence and honor) I mean contrariety or suspicion in religion, yet the
Queen ever respected this House, and principally this noble Lord, whom she
first made Master of the Horse, and then admitted of her Council of State; in
his youth (part whereof he spent before he came to reside at Court) he was a
very fine Gentleman, and the best Horseman and Tilter of the times, which were
then the manlike and noble recreations of the Court, and such as took up the
applause of men, as well as the praise and commendation of Ladies, and when
years had abated these exercises of honor, he grew then to be a faithful and
profound Councellor, and as I have placed him last, so was he the last liver of
all the Servants of her favor, and had the honor to see his renowned Mistress,
and all of them laid in the places of their rest, and for himself, after a life
of a very noble and remarkable reputation, he dyed rich, and in a peaceable old
age, a fate, (that I make the last, and none of the slightest observations)
which befell not many of the rest, for they expired like unto lights blown out,
with the snuff stinking, not commendably extinguished, and with offense to the
standers by. And thus have I delivered up this my poor assay, a little draught
of this great Princess, and her times, with the Servants of her State, and
favor, I cannot say, I have finished it, for I know how defective and
imperfect it is, as limbed only in the original nature, not without the
active blemishes, and so left it as a task fitter for remote times, and the
sallyes of some bolder Pensill to correct that which is amiss, and draw the
rest up to life, as for me to have endeavored it, I took it to consideration
how easily I might have dashed in too much of the strain of pollution, and
thereby have defaced that little which is done, for I profess I have taken
care so to master my Pen, that I might not ( ex animo, or of set purpose)
discolor truth, or any of the parts thereof, otherwise then in concealment.
Happily there are some which will not approve of this modesty, but will censure
me for pusillanimity, and with great cunning Artists attempt to draw their line
further out at large, and upon this of mine, which may (with somewhat more
ease) be effected for that the frame is ready made to their hands, and then
happily I could draw one in the midst of theirs, but that modesty in me forbids
the defacements of men departed, whose posterity yet remaining, injoyes the
merit of their virtues, and do still live in their honor: and I had rather
incur the censure of abruption, then to be conscious, and taken in the manner
of sinning by eruption, and of trampling on the graves of persons at rest,
which living, we durst not look in the face, nor make our addresses to them,
otherwise then with due regards to their honors, and renown to their Virtues.

FINIS.
